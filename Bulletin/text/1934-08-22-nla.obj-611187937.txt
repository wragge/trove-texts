THE SECRET OF
BLACK and WHITE’S
SUCCESS
&'^r , y.(rt'ie's'
It’s a very fine
cigarette
The tremendous popularity of Black and Whites is proof that they
are better cigarettes. One most important reason for their superiority
is their perfect freshness.
This comes from the triple wrapping .... tissue and foil within the
packet; moisture-proof " Insulane” outside .... protecting the fine
Virginia tobaccos from which these century-famed cigarettes are
blended. All the fresh, mellow fragrance is preserved. That’s why
they’re smooth and satisfying to smoke. No other cigarette at their
price has this completely efficient wrapping. No wonder everybody
says Black and Whites are the finest cigarettes they’ve ever smoked!

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
niorning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

The Sunday Mail
Brisbane
Should be Included in Every National
Advertising Campaign
As a newspaper “The Sunday Mail” speaks for itself, and the average net
circulation for April (42,696), May (44,006) and June (46,300) bears testimony
to the ever-widening circle of readers of Queensland’s great Sunday news-
paper-magazine and to the ready appreciation with which it is received
wherever it goes.
The consistently increasing popularity of “The Sunday Mail” renders
necessary its inclusion in every national advertising campaign planned for
the Queensland market. Used in conjunction with “The Courier Mail,”
Queensland’s greatest daily, it gives a combination unequalled in coverage
and lowness of cost. Further particulars gladly supplied on request.

HIS
BOOKS
Art and Practice of Propaganda
Professor Lasswell, the American
authority on political science, showed in
his “Propaganda Technique in the World
War” how politicians inflame the minds
of the ignorant and impressionable.
Some extracts:
By far the most potent role of
ganda is to mobilise animosity against i
enemy.
It must be shown that the enemy is not
only insolent. He is sordid.
The enemy conducts a lying propaganda.
Tn/j.' theme is of particular importance.
A catalogue of the crimes which the
enemy has been held to have perpetrated is
stimulating... .and a form in which the
propaganda complaints may be made
against the enemy is in the controversial
statement or pamphlet.
All these conditions are fulfilled in
Why I FightJ by J. T. Lang (Labor Pub-
lications ; 7s. 6d.). The trading banks
are the enemy, and they are represented
as insolent, sordid and the authors of
lying propaganda against Mr. Lang.
There is another kind of propagandist
who fights hard for pacifism. He uses
the same technique, but in reverse, so to
speak. World Without War, by Philip
Smithells (Dent; 2s. 6d.), is an interest-
ing example. Like Mr. Lang’s book, it
is addressed to the possessors of child-
minds. Readers are shown “in simple
phrases” the folly of arming, and “a
way in which young persons may work
for peace.”
The Fight for Inflation
The first 113 pages of Why I Fight!
are devoted to proving that the Australian
trading banks have been highly successful
as a rule, and that their directors are
capitalists who, in many cases, are
directors of other successful businesses.
The efficiency of the bankers is stressed
in the same way as the efficiency of the
Germans was during the war; people so
formidable must be wiped out K >
world is to be made safe for the :
nents. They conspire secretly against
the forces of virtue as represented by Mr.
Lang and his followers. Look at the
governor of the Bank of England:
Jew Suss” of Internationalism, mystery
man of the bankers’ cult, now reposing in
the plush parlor of the counting-house as
Montagu Norman, now travelling furtively
incognito, sponsor of the Berlin Reichs-
bank, intimate of Benjamin Strong [etc.,
etc.].
The directors of the Australian trad-
ing banks are on a par with this sinister
being; in fact, some are directors o '
the Bank of England. Their atrocities
consist chiefly (1) in being directors oi'
other profitable businesses, (2) in refus-
ing to “reflate.” Mr. G. J. Cohen is
“director of a number of N. S. Wales
financial and industrial concerns” ; Mr
James Ashton, another anti-reflationist
is “a director of the Commercial Bank-
ing Co., Anthony Horderns, Ltd., and
the Mutual Life and Citizens’ Insurance
Co.” ; and all these concerns are omin-
ously successful.
Banks have been started in N. S. Wales
in recent years by men who were not
capitalists, and had no experience of
banking. The Mercantile Bank of Aus-
tralia, for example, which was registered
in March, 1928, with a nominal capital
of £2,000,000, and which expired sud-
denly, to the surprise of the shareholders
who had been roped in by an energetic
selling campaign, in the following Sep-
tember. According to the logic of Why
I Fight! the gentlemen who were running
this concern when it went the way of
the N. S. Wales Government Savings
Bank are more desirable, as directors,
than those whose financial and business
abilities have been vouched for on scores
of publicly-advertised balance sheets.
The objective of Mr. Lang’s campaign
is revealed after the* unworthiness of his
capitalistic enemies has been demon-
s tr a t e d on the
above lines: it is
“controlled credit
expansion.”
It requires only
courage in our
people, courage to
remove objectors from the way. Once the
credit has been made available through
the State pledging its own future as the
security—instead of, as at present, the
individual entering into the contract —
it becomes necessary to see that the amount
expended is employed in such a manner
as will return the maximum social benefit.
Mr. Rufe Naylor has been advocating
this policy in the Sydney Domain. He
differs from Mr. Lang in two respects:
he isn’t afraid ol the word “inflation”
and he specifies the sum that will be
needed for a start—£so,ooo,ooo. Asked
by an interjector recently if he would in-
flate to £100,000,000 he said, “Yes ; pro-
vided the money is required for the social
benefit.” Under the system which Mr.
Lang is “fighting” for more money is
always required since those who are to
spend it have chief say, and it is always
forthcoming since politicians control the
issue.
The Fight for Disarmament
The author of World Without War is
an internationalist, and as full of good-
will as Mr. Lang is of class-prejudice.
He hates armies, navies, tariffs and “ugly
and useless war memorials.” Let us do
away with such horrors, he urges, and
be peaceful and happy. If we disarm
others will follow suit, for no one wants
to fight again ; not even the dispossessed
Germans. It is quite a mistake to think
that the Germans are warlike or would
treat others tyrannically or unjustly if
they could.
I am not forgetting all the unhappiness
lor the Jews and Communists that there
has been in Germany; perhaps here the
Nazis have made their worst mistake, but it
is perhaps largely our and the Great Powers’
fault. We have made the Germans so im-
patient that they have lost their tempers,
and as they could not attack anyone outside
their own country, they have attacked
someone inside it.
Hitler is a pacifist.
Unfortunately, many of his younger
officers and some old soldiers have not
understood his idea He is finding it
difficult because some of them feel that
another war would help Germany.
It is only another aspect of the latest
Lang Plan. Get rid of national defence
forces in the shape of soldiers, etc., says
Mr. Smithells, and the Empire will be
safe, since no foreigners would take ad-
vantage of the inspiring gesture to rob
it of territory. Not even the angry Ger-
mans. Get rid of financial defence forces
in the shape of capable and solvent bank
and other directors, says Mr. Lang, and
give control of the people’s savings to
politicians. The currency in which the
savings are denominated may be “re-
flated, but the operation will be carried
out “in such a manner as will return the
maximum social benefit,” and nobody’s
nest-egg will be diminished. Nothing is
needed on the one hand by Britain, and
on the other by Australians with homes,
insurance policies, bank accounts and the
like, but a belief that human nature has
changed ; that no foreigner wants any
part of the British Empire or ever will,
and that no politician will ever again
play the fool with his country’s currency.

The Modem Poets
When I approach most modern poetry
I confess to a feeling of profound scepti-
cism. Some of its devices are quite
obviously those of precocious children
trying to attract the attention of adults:
i remark how through deep lifted
fields Oxen distinctly move, a
yellowandbluish cat (perched why
curvingly at this) window, yes
women sturdily meander in my
mind, woven by always upon
sunset,
crickets within me whisper
Oceans of such bilge have poured from
the founts of English and American Heli-
cons. Then there is the school, headed,
I believe, by the Sitwells, which follows

more orthodox rules of prosody while
indulging in queer antics of the imagina-
tion :
A lady stood amid these crops—
Her voice was like a blue or pink
Glass window full of lollipops,
Her words were very strange, I think.
The T. S. Eliot school is entitled to more
respect. In “The Waste Land,” that
bitter cry of disillusionment, there are
some remarkable passages of concrete
imagery. But for the most part Eliot
strikes me as less an artist than a uni-
versity professor cracking a series of
learned and abstruse jokes for the bene-
fit of fellow-seminarists cooped up with
him in the same circle of cultural inter-
ests.
I am told that “The Waste Land” is
full of references to “The Golden
Bough,” Sir J. G. Frazer’s enormous
work on comparative religion. I read
that work many years ago, and I can see
in Eliot’s poem allusions to it floating up
like fragments from an ocean liner. It
is as impossible for me to reconstruct
Frazer’s thesis from Eliot’s allusions as
it would be for a salvage company to re-
construct the ocean liner from the flot-
sam and jetsam of its boat deck, and
its submerged first-class music-room from
the remnants of broken furniture. The
Eliotolators are very proud of being able
to detect the origins of Eliot’s esoteric
allusions, but this kind of knowledge
appears to me to have no artistic signifi-
cance whatever.
When I turn to the late D. H. Law-
rence, however, 1 am in an entirely dif-
ferent atmosphere. His prosody is as
unconventional as that of his fellow-
versesmiths who leave out capital letters
and print an occasional line upside
down ; but it is not the unconventionality
of mere arbitrary caprice. Lawrence
gives you the effect of rushing at his
subject matter like a bull at a gate.
But you are left with the impression
that he had something to express
and that he expressed it so well that
you are unconscious either of slovenli-
ness or of device. In his Collected
Poems he has a whole section devoted
to poems about reptiles, birds and mam-
malia. He makes you see, smell and
feel these animals as if they were present
in the body. But there is something more
in Lawrence than this magical ability to
give back the immediate impression:
there is the understanding of it.
A poet, it seems to me, is a good poet
to the extent that he knows something
about life. If his knowledge of life is
confined to books, or limited by his
years, or cramped by the social prejudices
acquired in a public school, or other-
wise censored by his educational con-
ditioning, then his poetry may be pre-
tentiously imitative and in the latest
fashion, but it will have no more objec-
tive validity than the cheer-songs of the
Rotarians. It is obvious from such of
his novels as “Sons and Lovers” that
Lawrence understood what he was look-
ing at. There is the same understanding
in his poems, and, incidentally, there is
the same understanding in Shakspeare’s
sonnets.
Eliot has imitators. There are hordes
of them in Australia. They copy his
cynicism, paraphrase his similes and re-
tail his learning at second-hand without
bothering to read the originals, and the
results, to my mind, are generally dismal.
I suspect that it must be an easy thing
‘o do, since so many do it successfully.
I also suspect that the fact that there are
few, if any, imitators of Lawrence is by
way of an indication that that poet was
the real Triton among the minnows.
F. S.
“Tom Collins”
A nation-wide revival of interest in the
late “Tom Collins” (Joseph Furphy)
seems to be imminent. Such Is Life,
originally published by The Bulletin,
was dragged into a second edition 14
years later, but that edition was soon
snapped up like its predecessor, and
copies had to be sought for diligently in
second-hand bookshops. Since then
London publishers (notably Jonathan
Cape) have talked of a third edition. But
it is a tremendous job. The second
edition contained about 300 pages (large
crown octavo) of fairly close print, and
the executor has refused—rightly— to
allow abridgments.
It has been said that there is too much
good literature in Such Is Life to give the
book an appeal to a large circle of
readers—ever. The late Arnold Bennett
wrote that a classic was a work which
gave pleasure to the minority “intensely
and permanently interested in litera-
ture” ; and Vance Palmer carried the
idea further in his preface to the second
edition of Such Is Life. He prophesied
that it would “become a classic for the
next generation.”
Lest this be considered to mean that
Such Is Life is likely to please only a
minority, it should be qualified. It is
the job of that minority “permanently
interested in literature” to rescue it from
the discard, but there is not a fragment
of reason for the belief that Tom Collins
cannot be made a friend of every serious
reader in Australia. Like all reflexes of
real life, his work possesses facets that
attract many different types. From the
first page of Such Is Life one might have
-recoiled because of its air of self-
conscious cleverness. Then comes the
swift, half-relieved, half-cynical plunge
forward:
Unemployed at last
Who in this day and generation would
not read on after that? And for the
following 20 pages you are rewarded by
a picture of men and a period more
graphic in a sustained sense than any-
thing ever written in Australia by another
hand. There is no forcing of the humor
that flows spontaneously from these un-
romanticised bullock teamsters. In the
preservation of this phase of Australian
life as well as in the memorialising of
human character under new conditions,
no less than in his gift of fresh and
original phrase, Tom Collins left more
than one durable girder in the bases of
the temple of literature which is being
slowly raised in Australia.

War and' Words
H. R. Knickerbocker, says his em-
ployer in an introduction to Will War
Come in Europe ? (The Bodley Head ;
55.), is, “with Walter Duranty and Paul
Scheffer, of the ‘Berliner Tageblatt,’ ” one
of the “three most famous newspaper-
men alive.”
Taking this resplendent tribute with
him from the U.S.A., Mr. Knickerbocker
made a whirlwind tour of Europe a few
months back, pausing long enough in
each capital to look up the dictator of
the moment and say in effect: “Hey!
When do you think we’ll have a war?”
The only lands in which he was unable
to get a direct answer were Britain and
Germany. In Britain he had to rely on
quotations from speeches by Messrs.
Baldwin and Winston Churchill and
some minor politicians.
Britain is alarmed to-day. She is alarmed
as she never was since Tirpitz and his
Navy League built the German Fleet into
a challenge to British security.
There are people in Britain who are
worried, but they are not the rank and
file of the population, which, judging by
the papers, is more concerned with the
chances of Chase Me Charlie in the 3.15
than with the chances of war. But even
the worst British alarmist does not seem
to be as gloomy as a good many Euro-
pean statesmen. Lloyd George, since
Mr. Knickerbocker wrote, has. said that
war is not likely for at least a decade.
Masaryk of Czecho-Slovakia is con-
fident that there will be no hostilities.
To Boris of Bulgaria “war is incredible
so long as the present generation exists.”
Alexander of Yugoslavia thinks that there
will be no battles in the Balkans. Hitler
declares that he does not want war, “not
only to-day... .but to-morrow.”
As a swift summary of the situation,
Mr. Knickerbocker’s book is interesting,
though its pictures sometimes lack pro-
portion, and the wide gaps in his collec-
tion of first-hand opinions represented
by some of the greater countries reduces
its value. His summary of the situation
exemplifies his sensational style:
The armaments race is on. They are off.
Germany, France, Britain, Russia, Japan,
Italy, are off on the race that ends in the
Olympic games of death.

Another View of “Landtakers”
My quarrel with “Landtakers” is that
the theme is capriciously presented. The
opening scene is dramatic. Then follows
a chapter (it should have been a pro-
logue) which breaks in on the suspense.
After that the author plunges. The
agony of the convicts is piled on so
thickly that it goes in one ear of the
mind and out the other ; and there are
hurried daubs of bush atmosphere. For
example:
Rising to the west on abrupt escarpments
cut through by gullies still gloomy and
moonstruck, falling to the east in wave
after wave of untinted greyness, the bush
was a gigantic fist in which the homestead
lay like a grain of sand, a thing of such
oceanic antiquity that his little time-bound
heart might well falter at thoughts of
conquest there.
All the outward and visible excellence
of the portrait of McGovern can’t make
up for the misgiving I have as to his
inner and spiritual significance in the
story. And I don’t believe Penton him-
self ever got inside McGovern’s skin,
though he tried hard—in the guise of
Cabell. The tension between Cabell and
McGovern never seems real. Penton is
clever enough to feel where he misses—
or is likelv to miss—so he deliberately
mislays this part of the plot. He hides
the sheep-stealing incident under mysteri-
ous hints, and has the effrontery to assert
“One evolves a straightforward story
from events that were twisted and dark-
ened by the cunning of men.” By this
time I can’t help thinking that Cabell
the ancient is dragged in as storyteller
to put me off the scent of Penton’s own
uncertainty as to how his characters
stand.
When McGovern is dropped the story
does grip, and the emotional values be-
come real. When McGovern reappears
the author grows wily again. There’s
your money’s worth of action and ges-
ture and intrigue and sensation. But a
completely satisfying book? No, Mr.
Pen ton!

TO ALDOUS HUXLEY.
(Aldous Huxley, whose books were banned by the
Australian Censor, has been invited to the Melbourne
centenary celebrations.)
Our brave New World has done one more
brave thing:
It banned your books and now, to ease the
sting,
It asks you here to take a close-up view
Of what we gained by never reading you.

A Satchel of Books
The Countryman (July, Aug., Sept.).
This half-crown English quarterly has a
charm which is all its own. The articles
are short —some, indeed, are fragmentary
—but they all deal with some odd or
fascinating aspect of country life. Not
necessarily in England. Some of the
articles are about America, and one of
the full-page photographs shows a kan-
garoo playing with some cats in Queens-
land. Its appeal is to almost any nature-
lover who is on the land or owns a
garden.
Coffee for None, by Alfred B. Cald-
well (Elkin Matthews and Marrot; 7s.
6d.). Mrs. Foucharde, society leader, has
been run in for drunkenness, together
with several friends, on the night of the
murder—one of the two victims being
her husband.
The committing magistrate had turned
his attention to the next in line.
“What’s your name?’’
“You can just call me Jeanette, Captain.
You big handsome brute.”
“Come on now, this ain’t no game.
What’s your name?”
So you can guess their nationality. It’s
a clever story, and the dogged deter-
mination of Freddy, the hero, never to
open his mouth without saying some-
thing funny may appeal to some. It
affected the writer like a plague of smok-
ing-room bores.
The Gentleman from San Francisco,
and Other Stories, by Ivan Bunin (The
Hogarth Press; ss. 3d.). Bunin, winner
of the Nobel Prize for 1933, is a Russian
emigre who has lived in France since
the revolution. He was a young con-
temporary of Chekhov, and his inherit-
ance of a great tradition gives his stories
a distinction probably surpassed only by
D. H. Lawrence, who, incidentally, held
Chekhov in contempt. The tale which
gives the volume its title is a brilliant
study of an American millionaire who
makes a voyage to Italy in a liner sur-
rounded by every luxury and plied with
service by hordes of serfs, and returns,
forgotten, in the hold in a plain deal
coffin.
James Shore's Daughter, by Stephen
Vincent Benet (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.). We
see an American capitalist and his
daughter through the eyes of a cosmo-
politan who meets them first as a boy in
the U.S.A., and afterwards in Paris.
Garry, the narrator, likes James Shore,
and he has a love-affair with the daughter
after her marriage to a scion of an old
N. York banking family ; but, as an artist,
he learns to despise them for their
materialism. Particularly after the 1929
crash. The more obvious criticisms are
amusing (Garry’s fatuous mother is par-
ticularly good), but the author prefers
sublety to directness. From the blurb:
Garry, now middle-aged, meets Violet
again. “Do you like pictures, I forget?”
he asks, and she replies, “I like real things
better.” Could a character reveal herself
more completely in five words?
Do you like canned fruit? Do you like
canned music? Do you like artificial
heat? To these and a hundred other
questions the answer might be “I like
real things better”; and it would do
nothing whatever to reveal character.
Shad’s Oak, by Dion Clayton Calthrop
(Chapman and Hall; 7s. 6d.). Peter Can-
talon comes to the little English village of
Shad’s Oak, after years of wandering the
worlcl as a sailor, determined to settle
down in the character of a dead friend.
The deception passes off all right, but,
partly because of restlessness and partly
because of shame, he’s about to move
on. Then he falls in love. A pleasant
yarn, full of old thoughts, which are so
neatly put that they seem bright and
new.

THE POLICY-MAKERS.
Room for the makers of policy speeches!
Four of them were heard last week, in
halls and over the air, and there may be
more to come. Perhaps a Douglas Credit
man, a Communist, a Tariff Deformer,
a Disunionist and the leader of a new
Labor party —South Australia seems
likely to throw up another at any
moment. Ideas are fermenting in minds
which, before the depression, gave no
thought to politics (in many cases
because the owners were at school); a
spirit of rebellion against the party
machines is abroad in the land, and to
the finding of scapegoats and short cuts
there is no end.
According to custom, the Prime
Minister was first in the field. A stout,
jolly-looking man in middle life, he has
to be very careful what he says. It is
only three years since he threw in his lot
with his present political friends, and he
was for 22 years associated with those
who are now his political enemies. It
would never do if he confounded them
in a momentary lapse of memory after
the fashion of Lord - Raglan, who, one
of Wellington’s men in the Penin-
sula, was given to forgetting in the
Crimea that he wasn’t fighting the French.
Mr. Lyons is .careful. He rarely lets
himself go. Indeed, he becomes enthu-
siastic only when referring to the achieve-
ments of his Government (“our efforts
have resulted in what must be regarded
as one of the most spectacular economic
recoveries the world has ever known”)
and those of the banks (“they were the
sheet-anchor of Australia ; the Common-
wealth Bank saved Australia in a great
crisis”), and to “the courage and sus-
tained effort of the people themselves.”
His old party, now divided into factions,
would strike deadly blows at the banks ;
his new party will protect them. And it
will maintain, tariff protection for “all
soundly-economic manufacturing enter-
prises” and give increased protection to
the country by “reconditioning and add-
ing to our existing services and defences”
—this “without imposing further burdens
on the taxpayer.”
There remains the question of unem-
ployment. It is never absent from the
speaker’s thoughts. So, in conjunction
with the State Governments, he is pre-
pared to go in for “a vigorous policy of
works.” Not tiddly-winking projects, “a
multiplicity of small local jobs of doubt-
ful value”—large vague things, such as
unification of railway gauges and extrac-
tion of oil from coal and shale, with
a Minister of Unemployment to attend
to them. There has been discon-
tent in the three small States, and, to the
Prime Minister’s astonishment, it still
exists, although “complaints have been
investigated by several Royal Commis-
sions and, finally, by the Commonwealth
Grants Commission.” Very well, then ;
the Lyons Government will resuscitate
the Inter-State Commission “as a working
part of the Constitution, with such
powers as the Constitution now permits.”
The High Court has ruled that these
powers don’t amount to a row of pins,
but people have short memories, and the
words “Inter-State Commissipn” have
an imposing sound.
Dr. Earle Page, leader of the Country
party, is next. He has the confident
manner of the successful surgeon and a
benevolent expression, and is ready to
perform a major operation on the tax-
payer without hurting him a bit. Dr. Page
is a politician with ideas, which pop
into his head at odd moments and tend
to become unfixed. At present he is
tremendously in earnest about a plan for
the relief of rural debtors which will
cost a mere £12,000,000, and he is all for
home-consumption prices for produce
(especially wheat) “such as already
operate for butter and dried fruits,” and
for “a stabilised exchange rate.” He takes
credit for strengthening the Common-
wealth Bank, “having set out in 1924 to
make it a pivot of Australian banking,”
and “effected evolutionary changes which
saved Australia” ; and he recalls, with
equal complacency, that “since Federa-
tion half the amount spent on the con-
struction of the Australian Navy was
spent by the Bruce-Page Government.”
But while strong for defence he has no use
for “economic nationalism,” which means
“domination by the bureaucrat, the very
negation of freedom” ; so he wants tariff
reduction, extension of the Ottawa agree-
ments and trade treaties with foreign
countries. One gets the impression that
he is prepared to work in with the U.A.P.
should it lose its majority.
Enter Mr. Scullin, leader of the largest
Labor faction, though it doesn’t shout the
loudest. Mr. Scullin is a small, worried
man who grows more solemn as he
grows older. A readier speaker than Mr.
Lyons or Dr. Page, he relies little on
notes, and ignores interjections ; but it
pains him when the irreverent laugh at his
guarantees of “resolute leadership,” such
as he gave the nation in 1931. Once a trade-
union organiser, then a small storekeeper,
then a member of Parliament for one
term, then a journalist for about as long
and, lastly, a politician since 1921, Mr.
Scullin has learned all there is to know
about banking, and if he becomes Prime
Minister again “the money masters” are
to go ; “control of monetary machinery
for private profits must give way to
national control for the benefit of all.”
This does not mean that if a man has
£lOO in a bank a Scullin Government
would seize it or halve its value by
making two notes grow where one
grew before. Nothing of the kind. A
Scullin Government would work the
oracle and a set of miracles by trans-
forming the Commonwealth Bank —sack-
ing the present board and setting up a gov-
ernor “free from political control.” So
free that, if a Labor Government asked the
governor—as the Scullin Government
asked the board —“to provide a mil-
lion pounds a month to employ 50,000
men full time on public works,” he would
have the right to refuse if he thought
refusal would be healthy for him. That
is all that Mr. Scullin means by “the
nationalisation of banking,” and he posi-
tively assures depositors that their fears
are unfounded. For the rest, he is in
favor of restoring 1929 rates of pensions
and pay to the million electors who suf-
fered cuts, and of guaranteeing “3s. 9d. a
bushel f.o.b. for all wheat sold off the
farm.” On the subject of national de-
fence all he had to say was that “the pur-
chase of a cruiser overseas was mon-
strous whilst thousands of Australians
were unemployed.”
Last on the list was Mr. Beasley, who
“leads” another Labor faction by per-
mission of Mr. Lang, whose shadow and
echo he is. A member of Mr. Scullin’s
Government until —obeying the Boss’s
orders—he became its wrecker, Mr.
Beasley claims to have “a defence pro-
gramme,” but is sparing of details,
though he hints that warships (unspeci-
fied, but probably equal in fighting value
to the galleys of Cleopatra and her boy
friend) will be built on the day-labor
principle at Cockatoo Dock. Defence
is plainly a bagatelle to Mr. Beasley.
His Great Thought is that “the banking
system must be nationally controlled and
the credit power placed in the hands of
the people”—and, no doubt, Mr. Lang,
Mr. Beasley, Mr. Garden and others of
their kidney are “the people.” These
things accomplished, Mr. Beasley pro-
mises :
The rapid removal of unemployment;
Immediate increase of purchasing power
by the immediate restoration .of all wage-
rates to normal levels, with a reduced
working week;
Restoration of all Commonwealth pen-
sion- and pay-rates;
Increase of price levels of primary pro-
ducts, with the stabilisation of guaranteed
minimum prices above the cost of produc-
tion ;
Utilisation of the resources of the
national credit organisation to eliminate
the many disabilities suffered by the smaller
States, and
Susnension of private indebtedness of
all farmers and home-buyers, pending
stabilisation, to be followed by equitable
debt adjustment and the writing-off of
actual overcapitalisation of every section
of the community.
The A.M.P., a great depository of the
savings of the people (though not, per-
haps of the persons whom Mr. Beasley
means when he uses that expression) has
£20,000,000 out on mortgage. Govern-
ments are among the principal creditors
of farmers and home-buyers. Clearly the
changes proposed would call for super-
lative knowledge and efficiency on the
part of Mr. Beasley and the author of
“Why I Fight! ” —who would presumably
take command when the “fight” was
over —if they were not to result in a
stupendous smash. The author’s quali-
fications are familiar to everyone who
had an account in the Savings Bank
(deceased). Of Mr. Beasley’s little is
known, though it is remembered that
before he entered Parliament he had a
job selling electric irons.
FORESTRY.
The Prime Minister promises a national
forestry policy, and not before it was
needed. Forestry has had a melancholy
history in Australia.
In N. S. Wales, early settlers were
allowed to destroy valuable cedars and
use them for firewood and fencing-posts.
In North Queensland, millions of feet of
cedar, bean and other furniture woods
were cleared out with the firestick to give
space for maize farms and dairies. West-
ralia sacrificed jarrah forests ruthlessly
until it was discovered that jarrah land
was no good for farming, and the bank-
rupt group settlements have made great
inroads on the karri. And much of the
sandalwood with which the State was
endowed has also been wiped out.
Australia is the least-timbered of the
continents. Its big timbers are confined
to a narrow coastal belt. Its forest area
possible for permanent reservation is
only 1.08 p.c., or 30,469 square miles.
The Germans have 27 p.c. of their
country (48,000 square miles) under
commercial timbers. A few years ago
it was calculated that they provided work
directly for 1,000,000 people, while an-
other 3,000,000 were employed working
up raw materials obtained from forests.
In India’s 307,000 square miles of com-
mercial timberland, as the census shows,
over a million people and their depend-
ants are employed. These figures are prob-
ably below the real totals, since forest
work is a periodic occupation.
The Indian Forestry Department has
an income of £3,500,000 p.a., and for
10 years has shown a surplus ranging
from £1,000,000 to £2,300,000. The ser-
vice employs 16,000 persons, of whom
4000 have been trained in advanced
forestry schools and colleges.
Our six States have combined staffs of
about 2000, but trained tree men of
established reputation are rare. Westralia
has one, and Queensland another. S.A.
has a 60-year-old organisation, and, with
only 500,000 forest acres out of the
19,000,000-odd in the Commonwealth,
the staff is 40 p.c. bigger than the com-
bined personnel employed in all the other
States except Westralia. Tasmania em-
ploys only 10 foresters, N. S. Wales only
120.
The case of N. S. Wales is a peculiarly
bad one. Till recently it had a skilled
commissioner in charge. He had been
trained in India and Europe, and for
several years had been the Queens-
land Forestry chief. Suddenly, last Sep-
tember, Minister Vincent brought in a
bill to leave the way open for the trans-
formation of the Forestry Commission
into an ordinary department with an Un-
der-Secretary and the usual civil-service
appanages. He said it was urgent, and
moved that the bill be passed through all
its stages in one day. Passed it was, and
an office man was named acting-com-
missioner.
Pressure forced an inquiry. S. L.
Kessell, the W.A. Conservator of Forests,
conducted it, and reported that “the
N.S.W. Forestry Commission must be
given credit for a splendid record of
achievement”:
To suggest the abolition of the commis-
sion in favor of a department under a
clerical head is to contemplate a retro-
grade step which neither past experience
nor a study of the problems of the future
can justify.
Mr. Kessell recommended that a
“forester of high professional qualifica-
tions” be appointed commissioner. He
reported further that there was a “short-
age of mature trees and older-age classes
on all the more valuable and accessible
forest areas.” More softwoods must be
planted. Among hardwoods, “reserves of
durable timber suitable for conversion
into hewn sleepers and girders were
heavily overcut in all districts.” The
position was “serious.” But seemingly
Mr. Vincent does not regard it as such.
Possibly he aims at giving N. S. Wales a
controlling body like that in Victoria,
where one member of a commission of
three was a shire clerk and another a
schoolmaster.
The revenue of forestry departments
in the six States fell from £1,113,755 in
1927-28 to £493,674 in 1931-32. Out-
put of sawn timber declined two-sevenths
in four years. There has been little new
planting. Our exports of timber are
worth about £500,000 p.a. against
£1,000,000 in 1911. Though imports have
fallen off heavily, excess of imports over
exports is about 28,000,000 cub. feet per
annum, a fact largely due to the dearth
of native commercial softwoods.
It is high time we began planting in
the Commonwealth on a much larger
scale than is represented by the tiny pine
plantations of Canberra and of some of
the States. Many of the trees in the
huge forests of Europe are non-in-
digenous. They have been acclimatised
because they fit some local need. The
Commonwealth, which already controls
a forestry school and an experimental
station, might well emulate the European
and Indian examples, first surveying the
country’s timber needs and then laying
down or encouraging suitably-controlled
supplies for the future. In the process
a lot of healthy and permanent work
would be provided for people who now
have no outlet except the production of
more sewers.
THE CRAZY CENSORSHIP.
Customs Minister White recently ex-
pressed the opinion that “gangster films
are a more potent source of harm than
books on crime,” and he talked of ban-
ning them, together with “objectionable
pictured representations on hoardings.”
Some novels are also supposed to drive
Australians to sin. On this assumption
works of overseas and Australian writers
have been banned.
Where is Mr. White to stop? Gang-
ster films do no more to glorify crime
than gangster cablegrams, which pour in
whenever an American thug goes on the
run. One Australian paper, with a large
circulation among youths, flappers and
children, published over 20 columns
about Dillinger. On the day after the
bandit’s extermination nine pictures of
him appeared and an emotional column
and a half (“by cable”) beginning:
Betrayed by a woman, who will receive
a reward of £5OOO, John Dillinger died as
he had lived—in a hail of bullets and a
welter of blood.
There are two ways, broadly, of
handling sex, crime and allied subjects—
septic and antiseptic. The methods of
Aldous Huxley, who has been banned
here, are essentially antiseptic. His plain
speaking is no more inflammatory than
the plain speech of the Old Testament. A
form of literary septicism is exploited in
novels about London society which can
be found in any big circulating library,
and which are received without a
whimper by the reviewers of right-think-
ing dailies. These works correspond to
the photographs offered furtively to tour-
ists in Paris. They are rarely censored.
Neither are talkies which give flappers
and cockerels an impression that free
love is the road to glory. Unlike the
novels, which, to do them justice, are
cynically devoid of cant, as a rule, porno-
graphic talkies carry a rancid atmosphere
of sentimentalism. In “Sisters Under
the Skin” and “Morning Glory” beau-
tiful girls cohabit with old men and
do very well out of it; but the directors
are careful to stress that the girls thought
they were in love with the ancients till
True Love appeared in the form of young
men.
There is a big market for sancti-
monious pornography. A life of Aimes
McPherson, the much-married evangel-
ist, reeked of it:
God first gave and then took away
Robert Semple, but Harold and I parted
because at that time in my career the
paths to the Kingdom and to things of
the world led in different directions.
And now we are getting “the Life of
Mae West” ; the justification, according
to the advertisements, is that the
lady has been in gaol and has inspired
more smoking-room stories than anyone
living, but is a good scout and a regular
guy at heart.
A political censorship that interferes
in matters of sexual moraijty is as out
of place as one that interferes in sec-
tarian questions. It hasn’t even the back-
ing of a fixed set of principles as re-
ligious censorships have. This is why
the actions by which our censorship tries
to justify its salary are nearly always
unjustifiable to the point of absurdity.
Leg-shows are banned or hacked, while
alleged romances in which the porno-
graphic intent is as clear as in a London
society novel are passed uncut. Yet the
reaction of modern audiences to leg-
shows is boredom, while a certain type
of youth is apt to take the free-love pro-
pagandists seriously.
These days thousands of Australians,
young and not-so-young, are got up to
look like U.S.A. film-erotics. How-
ever, there is no evidence, either in
our crime or divorce statistics, that
we are imitating American manners and
customs in other respects ; and in any
event propaganda similar to that of the
talkies is being conducted in a dozen
other quarters. If the censorship is really
needed it should be enlarged to enable
all the books, magazines, syndicated
articles and cables that arrive in the
Commonwealth to be examined before
being released. But, of course, it isn’t
needed. No other literate country has
anything like it, and the sooner we get
in line with England and the Continent
in this respect the better it will be for the
national culture.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Speed' in Flying.
When the London-Australia aerial ser-
vice was first mooted, Senator Pearce
and his co-organisers believed that a con-
tract speed of from 95 miles to 119
miles per hour would be satisfactory.
The Bulletin pointed out that Ameri-
can transcontinental services were being
flown at 140 m.p.h., and that their
owners contemplated the use of machines
capable of a touring speed of over 200
m.p.h.
The speed of the Imperial Airways run
was then increased to 145 m.p.h., special
light and roomy ’planes being built for
(he Singapore-Australia sections. This
was considered “entirely satisfactory,” at
a time when the Dutch were experiment-
ing with a Ponder machine with which
it was hoped to cut the time from
Amsterdam to Batavia to three days,
with day- and night-flying. Now the
opening of the Australian service has
been anticipated by the placing of the
first of the Douglas transport ’planes on
the New York-Los Angeles run. It
covered 2650 miles in 13hr. 4min. under
adverse conditions, with 14 passengers
and luggage aboard.
The Dutch co. has ordered one of
these machines. It will be flown in the
centenary air race, and if it succeeds it
will be put on the London-Batavia run.
It will be capable of doing the distance
in four days of 11 hours each; with
night-flying, in under two days.
Mr. Robinson, managing director of
New England Airways, who has just re-
turned from the U.S.A., says that in the
carriage of mails and passengers it is
nearly all night-flying there.
Machines fly with safety and comfort
at 200 m.p.h. I travelled across the con-
tinent in a 12-passenger flying sleeper in
perfect comfort.
These facts do not deter the Common-
wealth Government from endorsing the
slothful scheme under which London is
to be 12 days from Cootamundra —fly-
ing time, under eight hours per day ;
distance covered per day, about 1100
miles. Under the Australian schedule it
will take two days to get from Darwin
to Cootamundra (2219 miles). Passengers
will spend a night at a “palatial modern
hotel” which the Government will build
for their comfort. With up-to-date
machines they could tuck into their
sleepers at 10 p.m. and be in Sydney for
breakfast next morning.

The Victorian Budget.
It is in the best Melbourne manner. The
deficit for 1933-34 was £769,000. With
the help of Commonwealth grants it is
hoped to cut this to £243,000 during the
coming year. A railway loss of £536,000
has to be faced, another £780,000 has to
be earmarked for water-supply deficits
and an additional £925,000 is to be
dropped into the land-settlement sink.
Income tax is expected to yield
£150,000 more than last year, land tax
slightly less and Commonwealth pay-
ments £550,000 more, while there is to
be a reduction of interest to 4\ p.c. on
all Government loans carrying a higher
rate.
Civil servants and pensioners score.
No service pensions under £lO4 p.a. will
now be subject to deduction, and those
above, which have been reduced 8 p.c. to
25 p.c. as a depression measure, will get
one-fourth back. Moreover, 25 p.c. of
salary cuts will be restored. The tax-
payer gets no concession at all.
In ignoble imitation of N. S. Wales
the Argyle Government has been deduct-
ing relief tax from “all dividends” re-
ceived by Victorians, “irrespective of
source.” It was hoped that the abandon-
ment of this variety of the double-tax
ramp would be announced in the Budget;
but it is to go on.
♦
Bread and Mystery.
The price of bread goes up with the price
of wheat, and (this is part of the mys-
tery) contrives to stay up when the price
of wheat comes down with a rush. It
has accomplished the latter feat once
more.
In a scheme launched in N. S. Wales
it was suggested that the 21b. loaf should
be 6d., delivered, on a flour basis of £lO
a ton. Its sponsor, however, agreed that,
with flour at £9 155., 4|d. over the
counter and delivered, an advance
of id. per loaf on prices then ruling,
should give a fair return.
Sydney Master Bakers shared the
gentleman’s second thought about values.
On August 11 they increased the price
by a farthing a loaf. They declared
that they “had not rushed the in-
crease” ; though flour was £9 15s.
per ton they were “working on a
price of £8 12s. 6d.” There are
kind hearts everywhere. A week later
flour was quoted at £8 15s. in Sydney, but
the association had not experienced a
humanitarian desire to cut the price on
a basis of £7 12s. 6d., which flour might
reach. Individual bakers are made of
softer stuff. Some of them, despite the
association, are selling at 3|d. One told
a Sydney evening paper that “we can
sell at a profit over the counter at that
price.”
The wholesale bakers who supply us at
3s. per dozen must be able to show a
margin on that or their prices would
go up.
The N. S. Wales Government is still
“considering the position.” It “may have
to introduce legislation.”
Of the other mainland States, Queens-
land is the only one which has not
suffered a rise. Last week the price-
fixing commissioner, T. A. Ferry,
said that, in view of the increase in
flour prices, “there would be a
change shortly,” which was taken to
mean a farthing increase—the present
price of the 21b. loaf is 4|d. Later, he
decided that the fall which followed had
made an increase unnecessary. Adelaide
bakers had already moved, but a half-
penny put on there still left the prices—
4d. and 4j-d.—below those in other States
with flour at £9 7s. 6d. In Melbourne,
where there is a very energetic House-
wives’ Association, the old prices varied
as much as from 6d. cash per 41b. loaf
to lOd. delivered. They have gone up a
penny.
Perth bakers added a halfpenny to the
price of the 21b. loaf. The increase came
at a moment when the* flour market
showed signs of falling. Before the in-
crease, Perth rates had been 4d. over the
counter, 4|d. delivered for cash and sd.
delivered and booked.
Why do prices in the various capitals
differ so much? This is another part of
the mystery, and it is not explained by
pointing to differences in taxation, labor
and shop costs. They don’t amount to
a great deal. Silos and stores are full
to overflowing; a great many citizens
are still unemployed ; to the workless
and to part-timers and basic-wagers even
a farthing on the price of bread means
more than it ever did before. Much
as Government interference in trade is
to be avoided, some people seem to
court it.

Three Hundred Deaths a Year!
“Owner-Driver”: N. S. Wales Traffic
Superintendent Carter said the other day:
Each year at least 300 people are
doomed to die in the streets unless some-
thing is done to prevent the number of
accidents.
In every State year by year about 10
people in every 100,000 are killed, while
150 are seriously injured, by cars. The
superintendent gave the two chief reasons
as “speed” and “carelessness.” He didn’t
mention the most important of all—the
complete failure of our legal system to
deal with serious motor offences. Our
gaols contain many petty larcenists
but very few car-thieves, and a homi-
cide is rarely so much as charged with
manslaughter, much less murder, if he
does his killing with a car. Hence speed
and carelessness.
J. C. Watson, president of the
N.R.M.A., referred recently to the well-
known fact that certain drivers are “re-
peaters.” They have accidents over and
over again, and many have the same
kinds of accidents. A friend of mine has
been involved in four collisions at inter-
sections in 17 months. These drivers —
or anyhow some of them—are the equiva-
lent of recidivists, and under a logical
legal system they would be given the
equivalent of indeterminate sentences:
their driving licenses would be suspended
indefinitely.
All kinds of precautions are taken in
N. S. Wales against shark attacks (nets,
watch-towers, beach patrols, and so on),
though the odds against an attack on any
given beach and day are about five times
greater than the odds against winning a
first prize in one of Mr. Stevens’s lotteries.
No precautions are taken against car
accidents. A law compelling every car to
stop before emerging on to a main road
from a side-street would save at least
100 lives a year in N. S. Wales alone
provided it was enforced. If it was made
clear that “driving to the public danger”
(cutting-in, speeding in streets where
children are liable to appear, etc.) would
be punished as automatically as, say, the
possession of an unlicensed revolver the
toll of car-deaths might be diminished
by another hundred.
But there will be no improvement till
the law wakes up. We have car-gangsters
for the same reason that America has
crime-gangsters ; nobody in authority has
the courage to tackle them.
This Cricket.
Before the fifth Test match the body-
line-bowling argument blazed up again.
The last county match preceding the
game at the Oval was that at Notting-
ham, which shelters Larwood, Voce and
Carr, their skipper and champion. Carr
and Larwood did not play, but Voce
did ; and, bowling with a “leg” field, he
got 8 wickets for 68 —the most effective
bit of trundling against the Australians
during the tour.
A cloud of chroniclers has given its
testimony as to what happened after that.
The accounts differ on most points, but
all agree that the Australians were
annoyed at being exposed to the
risk of being flattened out before the
Test match, and that the relations
between the teams were uncordial. One
writer attributed to Woodfull the spoken
threat that, if his men had to face the
same type of bowling in London, he
would stop the proceedings and lead
them off the field. This was denied by
the manager, Bushby ; and Bushby also
contradicted a report that he and Wood-
full had protested to the M.C.C. against
Voce’s bowling. Woodfull said nothing
for publication. After Voce had rocked
in two wild overs in the Australians’
second innings he was withdrawn from
the match by the Notts committee. And
he was not chosen for the Test match,
though, with Larwood out, he should, on
form, have been the first English bowler
picked.
When the crowd found that its favorite
was not to play, it hurled sarcastic
remarks at the Australians and hooted.
The worst demonstration came from the
members’ pavilion, but the “bobbers”
kept up a running fire of rude remarks
about “squealers,” and when an Aus-
tralian chased a ball he would be hailed
as “Mardy”—a local synonym for “cry-
baby.” Once a rough-cut humorist,
addressing Woodfull, shouted “Teacher,
take your babies home!”
Marylebone is really to blame. Its
atitude has proved as idiotic as that of
the Board of Control was last year.
Either fast leg-theory bowling is fair or
it is unfair. If the M.C.C. pundits con-
sider it fair they should permit it, regard-
less of the feelings of Woodfull or any
other Australian cricketer; if they
reckon it unfair they should condemn
and forbid it. They have tried to steer
a middle course, and have disgusted
everybody.

The De Valera Plan.
“The pending transfer of Guinness’s brewery
from Dublin to the outskirts of London will
save the owners £160,000 a year. They will
escape the Free State tax of 2s. in the £ on
corporation profits.”— Cable.
Guinness’s has been Dublin’s chief
revenue-producer and employment-giver
for a couple of centuries. For many
years the south of Ireland has earned
more by exporting porter, beer and ale
—practically all of it produced by the
great Dublin concern —than it has from
any other source except cattle. Even
this year the Free State was paid three
times more by Britain for its stout and
ale than it was for its horses, and five
times more than it was for its bacon and
hams.
A slump in exports began with the
return of De Valera in January, 1933. In
1932-33 porter, etc., to the value of
£4,687,370 was exported ; the figures to
the end of last June were £3,952,894,
and they are falling. It is one of
Britain’s reactions to the De Valera
Plan, which so greatly resembles the first
Lang Plan. Transfer of the brewery
to England will rob Ireland of some of
its best workers, and it will drive
upwards of 10,000 other workers into
the ranks of the unemployed. Many
Free State farmers live on their sales of
barley to Guinness’s.
The reason for the rise of 3s. 6d. in
Guinness ordinaries on the release of the
news that the brewery was going to Eng-
land had little to do, probably, with the
fact that the directors will thereby save
De Valera’s tax on corporations;
brewery taxation is tremendous in Eng-
land. A much bigger factor must have
been the realisation by investors that
the business will be left alone in Eng-
land. No threat of the currency being
devaluated as a result of anti-capitalistic
legislation. No fear of riots, following
on the social troubles that arise when
currencies go wrong. A belief, which
De Valera has not been able to inspire,
that if riots did begin the national
Government would be able to deal with
them.

Forgan Smith’s Return.
Forgan Smith, home again after a hasty
visit to Britain, has been making speeches
which stand out from the rubbish spouted
by southern election campaigners. His
Scottish commonsense revolts against
foreign expedients which find favor with
Lang and other apostles of gloom:
To talk of restricting production when
thousands of people throughout the world
are in undeserved poverty is cold and
arrogant hypocrisy.
It is no part of his plan to injure
Britain, much less isolate Australia
by repudiation or socialisation. He even
dares to think that “the manner in
which the British people shouldered their
obligations in the difficult circumstances
of the times speaks very highly for the
race from which Australians have
sprung.” He admits that “civilisation in
Europe can only last if it can deal with
the poverty problem,” and believes that
progress can only be found in “increas-
ing the solvent demand for commodi-
ties.”
That is the task of the Labor move-
ment a veritable challenge to Labor.
Even the British Government does not
seem to have earned his hate. It assured
him that it was far from its intention to
limit imports of dairy produce from Aus-
tralia. And “meeting all classes, from
royalty to navvies,” he found “a keen
interest in Australian and particularly
in Labor policy.”
Forgan Smith leads the most united
party in Australia to-day. Fortunately
for him, his lot was cast in a State
in which interests are more unified than
they are in other States. But he can
claim some credit for the fact that Lang-
ism has ingloriously failed to get a foot-
ing in Queensland.
They have a system in the police under
which constables are transferred from
one capital to another. Pity the system
cannot be applied to Labor politicians
in N. S. Wales. A period of service in
Queensland might broaden their outlook
and mitigate their political passions and
faith in class hate as an engine of pro-
gress.

Cut It Out!
Fired by talk of a “rodeo” as part of
the centenary celebrations, a contributor
to one of the Melbourne dailies weighed
in with this:
Do visitors to Melbourne for a great
Australian festivity expect to see an Aus-
tralian performance with stock, or do they
desire an imported show that is in no sense
Australian and has no centenary significance
and no national significance?
One way to get at a right answer is to
consider how a “rodeo” would appeal
to the principal guest. The Duke seems
to be a fairly typical Englishman of the
educated class. As a serving cavalry
officer he has spent his adult years
among horses, and a good deal of his
life has been lived in the country. A
characteristic of such Englishmen, and
indeed of sporting folk of both sexes all
over Britain and Ireland, is scorn and
detestation of “rodeos.”
John Masefield, another typical Eng-
lishman who is to be a centenary guest,
has no more objection to the inhumani-
ties of fox-hunting, judging by his writ-
ings, than the Duke. But the alleged out-
laws which “rodeo” riders are supposed
to subdue are not outlaws at all; they
have to be tortured into acting as such
with flank-ropes. The cattle that are
banged down on the arena are not
wild —merely bewildered creatures with
no suspicions as to why they are sub-
jected to painful and ignominious
assaults.
The modern Briton hates “rodeos” on
the same principle that he hates bull-
fights, bear-baiting and cock-fighting,
and his prejudices are not so illogical
as some people make out. There is a
difference between cruelty to animals per-
petrated in the heat of the chase and
the cold-blooded cruelty of a rodeo-ring.
Anyhow, there the British prejudice is.
If Spaniards or Mexicans were being
entertained next November, a rodeo
would be quite in place ; as things are, it
isn’t.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Hunter Grubbe”: Act I: An Orange
(N.S.W.) policeman rides 35 miles by
motor-cycle and umpteen miles on horse-
back to apprehend a bewhiskered hermit
of 75 who has property worth £5OO wait-
ing for him in Sydney. Act II: The
affluent derelict is charged at the Orange
Police Court with having insufficient
means of support, evidence being pro-
duced to show that he has been living
a wild and carefree existence in the
bush. Act III: The bewhiskered hermit
is handed over into the custody of his
brother, who has him cleaned up prepara-
tory to entraining him for Sydney to
claim his fortune. Act IV.: The clean-
"No, ma’am; the wood-an’-coal man ain’t bin in here.”
shaven and cleaned-up hermit of 75, hav-
ing reached Sydney, is seen heading west
again with his swag.
* * * *
’S.A.C.”: Reference to the killing of
Dillinger (B. 1 /8/’34) recalls news-
paper accounts of the even more
drastic elimination of Clyde Barrow
and his female associate “Bonnie.”
After robbing numerous banks and
killing some 20 folk between them,
the bandit and his lady, who smoked
cigars continuously and was as handy
with a machine-gun as her partner,
were ambushed and shot down like the
mad dogs they were. To me the most
piquant part of the story lies in the re-
marks attributed to one Captain Hamer,
described as an ex-officer of the Texas
Rangers. “Of course I didn’t mind shoot-
ing Barrow,” said this purist, “but I sure
hated to shoot a lady, especially when
she was sitting.” Obviously, no decent
sportsman will shoot a sitting bird, any
more than he would catch trout with a
worm.
* * * *. *
“Reformed Prig”: The American
cruiser Astoria arrived in Sydney short
of a wonderful new-style lifebelt which
weighs a ton and becomes brightly
luminous on reaching the water. Just as
well, perhaps. The thing may have been
souvenired at a reception.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: Giving evidence in an
assault case, a Sydney detective was asked
by the accused man’s lawyer: “Did his
finger-prints disclose anything known
against him?” The reply was: “We
wouldn’t take his prints. His hands are
too hard.” 1 saw them afterwards and
fully realised the difficulty. They were
smooth and shiny as glass, the result of
years of axe-swinging.
* * * *
“L. I.B.”: “Exdig” is partly right
when he says (B. 15/8/’34) that men who
sought to enlist in the Light Horse and
found themselves assigned to infantry and
other units were told at the outset that
they had to join u£> for “general service.”
But that was quite late in the war. The
Light Horsemen of 1914 and 1915 were
definite L.H. enlistments and fought on
Gallipoli as such. When the Anzac M.D.
moved out into Sinai there was not room
for thousands of L.H. enlistments, who
were accordingly drafted into the infantry
and gunners. In the circumstances these,
too, had little ground for complaint. The
lads who had a genuine squeal were the
L.H. men who were invalided to Eng-
land after Gallipoli. In most instances
they were not allowed to return to
their units in Egypt, but were ordered
into other sections of the A.I.F. I still
hold half a dozen letters from some of
my old “boys” praying me to move
heaven and earth to rescue them —in
vain, of course.
* t- * *
“4 x 2”: “Retired Killer” (B. 8/8/’34)
gives figures of shot patterns on a target
at various ranges to confound my doubts
of the expediency of arming bank clerks
with sawn-off shotguns. He is correct
so far as the standard English guns
with 30in. barrels are concerned. Cut
the barrels down and the ratio of
“scatter” increases enormously. Cheap
Belgian guns will scatter like chaff at
almost any range, even when fitted with
30in. barrels. A 12-bore cylinder barrel
at 20 yards will pattern a diameter of
32in., and at 40 yards will cover a 57in.
circle. This can be done regularly with
a Purdey. If anyone does it with a cheap
Belgian gun it will be an amazing fluke,
* * * *
“Silverton”: I note (B. 15/8/’34) that
Queensland is thinking of extracting
alcohol from maize and making it com-
pulsory that all power spirit should con-
tain a proportion of the brew. Apart
from the fact that a similar move was
blocked by the High Court when the
Bananalanders proposed to do it with
sugar spirit, I should strongly advise
the experimenters to give the notion a
miss. Maize power alcohol, as South
Africa knows it, is said tp carbonise
heavily, and even with the most careful
blending with petrol is calculated to
wreck more cylinders in six months than
ordinary fuels can in six years. My
own experience of maize spirit is con-
fined to the whisky made from it by
"You cur, to insult a defenceless working girl!”
a Boer to whom Kruger granted a mono-
poly of manufacture for the Transvaal
while flopping a heavy duty on imported
brands. If the power spirit works in the
same way as the beverage variety did I
shall refuse' to have anything to do
with it.
* * * .*
“Carmelia”: Luck comes with a rush
to some people. A Bayswater (W.A.)
man in poor circumstances and worse
health won a small prize in a newspaper
competition. Encouraged, he bought a
lottery ticket and landed £12,000. A
Bunbury wharfie went to England to col-
lect a legacy. He returned in time to
rake off first prize in a State sweep.
The. Bayswater man, by the way, is
already adopting some of the eccentri-
cities of the rich. Volunteering to help
in lifting the debt off a local hall, he
cheerfully found £5O, but firmly refused
to hand out an odd two bob that would
have completed the contract.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: The modern youngster's
good night after a party fell on me in
a new form lately. The show
had been given by a relative,
and, feeling good and uncle-like,
I stood on the verandah and
contributed a farewell to the de-
parting guests. Along came a
bright modern girl of 13. She
thought she had said all her
good-byes, and here was this extra
turn staged. Natural frankness had a
short struggle with acquired politeness,
and they ran a dead-heat. “Good night,”
she said pleasantly. “You know, I
haven’t the slightest idea who you are.
But good night!”
“General Prac.”: The horrible Weil’s
disease (alias infective jaundice) is rarely
front-page stuff, so it’s queer to read
of outbreaks at opposite ends of the
earth, one in London, the other at Ing-
ham (Q.). In the latter place and there-
abouts, seven people have died and the
case-list numbers 50. Like syphilis,
Weil’s is due to a wriggling spirochete.
These organisms are common in dirty
sewers, slimy mine-pits, canals and other
haunts of the rat. Which explains why
an English sailor caught the disease four
days after an involuntary dip in the
Thames, why a London girl acquired
it after eating some Dutch tomatoes,
and why the world’s authority on the
subject is a professor from Amsterdam,
where people can’t help falling into
canals occasionally. There’s no doubt
that the thing would spread if rats and
dirty water could have their say ; it has
been found in all sorts of odd spots, such
as Japan, the East Indies, and on the
Western Front during the war. The
Ingham trouble will probably finish when
water-supplies, drains and rats have
received attention. Fortunately, too, a
useful serum is now on tap.
“Mudurup”: Is there any reason why
a Government employee shouldn’t spend
his annual holiday leave wherever he
wishes? Most people would fail to find
one, but a Perth tramwayman has dis-
covered differently. Summoned for a
small debt he was sentenced to a term of
imprisonment in default of paying up,
and his leave falling due at the same time
he “took it out” behind the bars. On
emerging he found the sack waiting for
him. He appealed to the usual tribunal,
contending that a man’s holiday time was
his own. The tramways boss admitted
that he had no fault to find with the
man’s work, but holidays, he argued,
were for recreation and to enable the
toiler to return to his job with renewed
vigor, which would hardly be secured by
a spell in prison. Appeal dismissed;
sentence confirmed.
* * * *
“Verri”: The Society of Dowsers can
take heart again, even after the widely-
chronicled failure of its Sussex demon-
stration (B. 15/8/’34). A few days later
it was announced in the Commons that
the War Office had utilised their services
to locate water. They are now offering
to locate anything, from underground
torrents to the lost mines of Ophir.
* * * *
“X.S.”: They take life easily in
U.S.A. from all accounts, and it seems
they don’t bother much about death cer-
tificates either, judging by a will case
that came up before the younger
Gavan Duffy in Melbourne. Gerit Alex-
ander Chalmers, who died in Vic. in
1892, left a large estate to be held in
trust for his sons. One of the sons died
in India, another assigned his interest,
a third is a doctor in Aberdeen
and a fourth is alleged to have died
in America. The only evidence is
a death certificate stating that Gerit
Randolph Chalmers, an analytical
chemist, died and was buried in Arizona
in 1915. The description agrees thus far
with that of the missing man, but it does
not say whether he was a bachelor or
married, and is explicit in stating that
he was black. Inquiries were instituted
and the undertaker was located. He de-
clares that the man he buried was white.
This suggests color-blindness or unusual
carelessness on the part of the relevant
authorities. Justice Duffy decided that
further inquiries ought to be made of
Uncle Sam.
A BURNING QUESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Dominion League suggests that the 200,000
copies of the ‘Case Against Secession’ dispatched to
Westralia should be burned, along with effigies of
the Prime Minister, Senator Pearce and the com-
pilers.”
What effort was wasted, what labor was lost!
Just think of the size, and consider the cost
Of the binding, the ink and the paper.
Atop of a bonfire condemned to be toss’d
And vanishing skywards in vapor—
All fuel, no more, for an auto-da-fe
In grimly recalcitrant W.A.
There’s a moth-eaten proverb concerning the
steed
To the stream or the trough or the bucket
you lead,
Yet can’t make him drink of the water.
And, mother Australia, indeed and indeed
It’s clearly as true of your daughter.
She won’t even listen to what you would say,
This sadly unfilial W.A.
You solemnly warned her, illustrious Joe
And pontifical George, that the way she would
go
Is a sheerly calamitous turning.
And all the requital you get is to know
You’re both of you brands for the burning,
Picked out and marked down for an auto-da-
fe
In sourly rebellious W.A.
You'll be dragged to the faggots, like martyrs
to grill,
Or leastways your counterfeit images will;
To the stake they will hoot you and hound
you.
While jeers and reproaches, incisive and shrill;
Will rock and re-echo around you,
A primitive sort of symbolic display
That’s never lost favor in W.A.
But think of the brains that went to it, and
think
Of the reams of good paper, the oceans of ink,
The arguments marshalled for reading,
The phrases and figures dressed up to the pink,
The oodles of eloquent pleading,
All fodder, no more, for an auto-da-fe
In stubbornly positive W.A.!

T. THE R.


“X.S.”: The other day in Melbourne a
thief set calmly and expertly to work to
remove a spare tyre from the back of a
car parked in the quadrangle of the Law
Courts. He completed his task under
the very eyes of police, detectives and
plainclothes men summoned as witnesses
in the various cases proceeding inside,
and strolled off with the property under
his arm. It recalls the case of the enter-
prising coolie who decamped with the
clock from above the Judge’s chair at
the Supreme Court in Singapore. Irate
counsel, disturbed in an oration, told the
intruder not to make so much noise.
The Melbourne bluffer wasn’t even
spoken to.

“Eheu Fugaces”: Beer never tastes
better than when “served, in its native
pewter”—l think the quotation is from
“Verdant Green”—but many Sydney
publicans doubt if the taste is worth the
gratifying. The modern pewter tankard,
delicately silvered, is an expensive affair,
worth a dozen glass receptacles for the
pint or the half-pint, and, to set off
against its unbreakableness, it has an un-
pleasant way of vanishing when hop-
juice is flowing freely and things are
humming generally and curio-hunters are
abundant. I asked for one of these mea-
sures the other morning; Bung shook
his head gloomily and intimated that the
cupboard was bare. “Over twenty of
them went on Anzac Day,” he grumbled.
Another vendor of hop-juice, who had a
few pewters left, assured me that Easter-
time was the open season for “collectors.”
“They come in handy for chaps going
out camping,” he added; “I wouldn’t
mind so much if they brought them back,
but they never do.” Still, there was
once a Shoreditch (London) publican who
complained his stolen pewters did come
back, to his detriment, in the shape of
half-crowns composed of the same base
metal.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: Melbourne’s list of unusual
vandals was added to when nearly 100
yards of railing lining the
upper edge of the St. Kilda
esplanade was found to have
been twisted out of align-
ment, some of the iron
scrolls being broken and
bent beyond repair. The
fact that each pair of scrolls
had been bent outwards sug-
gests that a man with an ex-
traordinarily powerful set of
hands had started out to
demonstrate his strength—
anonymously. The railing
was a fine specimen of
wrought-iron work, and was
erected in 1892. The damage runs into
hundreds of pounds.

‘ Mako”: As the up-country M.L.
train neared a dangerous level-crossing
the engine-driver was horrified to note
that Henare, in his new single-seater, was
apparently dashing to a collision at 60
m.p.h. The driver whistled furiously, but
Henare, full of pride in his new posses-
sion, decided to beat the train to the
crossing. He just failed, but, while he
was thrown clear, his car was carried
along and reduced to matchwood. “You
blithering idiot,” the driver roared,
“didn’t you hear me whistling?” Henare
replied with dignity, “You didn’t Hear me
say ‘Excuse me,’ eh?”

he would reserve his defence. “Well ”

you do if you were in my place?” “I
never have been,” replied the p.m. good-
humoredly, “but it is the usual thing to
do.” “Oh, well, I may as well stick to
the conventions,” said the accused.
“Marko”: “P.S.C.” attributes Hinden-
burg’s, Birdwood’s and Allenby’s war
successes to Ludendorff, Brudenell White
and Chetwode respectively (B. 15/8/’34).

ground of any great achievement, to
whom the credit should go. The matter
is really a psychological one ; the senior
man is often hampered in his plans by
a sense of responsibility, and his judg-
ment is affected accordingly. On the
other hand, the junior does not have his
brain clouded by fear of the conse-
quences if things go wrong. In every such
case the junior or chief of staff would be
most unlikely to carry out the same plan
were he the Commander-in-Chief. The
sense of responsibility has a vital effect
on all our actions: all of us frequently
recommend other people to do things we
would never do ourselves.
“Blackford”: Beneath Melbourne
streets flows the sewage of the city.
Along the sewers are manholes equipped
with iron ladders for inspection pur-
poses. The fumes and gases
corrode these ladders badly ;
hence they are taken out
periodically to be scraped
and re-tarred at a special
plant erected at the sewerage
depot. The other day a man
asked to be allowed to look
over these scrapings. His
inspection evidently proved
satisfactory, for he offered to
buy them. Curiosity made us
ask for what possible pur-
pose they could be used. He
replied that when the stuff was chemi-.
cally treated and the grit and dirt re-
moved it made the best coloring matter
obtainable—for lipstick!

“O. de V.”: Can’t agree with “Ex-
PBJ” (B. 8/ 8 / ’34) that the old tin
hat was useless against rifle and machine-
gun bullets. When the fid was not
clamped on by the front chin-strap, the
tendency of a direct rifle-bullet hit was
to knock the hat off. On the Somme we
carried out a series of experiments on a
Boche coal-scuttle, a French helmet and
one of our own tin hats. To begin with,
we set them firmly on the ground and
assaulted each in turn with a pick. The
French and German helmets, especially
the latter with its flat surface, were
easy marks, but it took several efforts
by a nuggety M.L. axeman to get
through the British article, and then only
on top, where it could be squarely hit.
The second test was at 100 yards with
service rifles. The Boche headpiece was
pierced every time, the French helmet
offered more resistance on account of its
shelving shape, but the British lid de-
flected every shot, although it collected
a few dinges. The only certain method
of piercing it was to prop it up and fire
into the part designed to hold the
wearer’s head. If a bullet had hit it from
that direction, he wouldn’t have cared
much, anyway.

“Archdeacon”: “X.N.O.’s” statement
that ships at sea are rarely struck by
lightning (B. 15/8/’34) recalls a story
told me years ago by a clerical relative.
A South African bishop was on his
way to England in one of the heavily-
masted and -sparred liners of the period,
which were helped as much by their sail
as their steam. One night he was
annoyed by the continual rapping of a
chain against his cabin porthole, which
had been closed in the threatening
weather. Getting hold of the chain he
pulled it in. to find a large ball at the end
of it. This he placed under his pillow,
while disposing of the long length of
chain as best he could, and fell into a
peaceful slumber. When the steward
came in with the morning coffee he
nearly fainted. What the bishop had
stowed away was the lightning-con-
ductor, and the vessel had subsequently
passed through one of the worst thunder-
storms the captain had ever experienced
in 40 years at sea.
“Nakh”: Fiction has been given an-
other sock in the eye by truth, this time
in Barcelona, Spain. A butcher, return-
ing to his shop unexpectedly, found his
wife in a state of intense agitation.
Despite her protestations that she didn’t
feel well, he insisted on taking her to a
cinema. Noticing as he went out
that the refrigerator door was standing
open, he shut it with a slam. When
the couple returned and the butcher
opened this particular room door, the
frozen body of his wife’s lover fell out.
In one of Balzac’s stories a lover hiding
in an alcove in his mistress’s bedroom
is walled in by masons while the unfor-
tunate lady lies in bed, too terrified to
speak. In this case, husband, a some-
what incredible character, sits by dis-
coursing on art, politics and philosophy,
very well aware of what is going on,
while the lover lets himself be immured.

“Meeparaka”: 1 wonder if the
authority who wrote in the “Australian
Encyclopaedia” about the “characteristic
odor” of aborigines (B. 15/8/’34) had
ever really smelt it? There may be a
racial odor underneath, as there is said
to be with the negro, but the natural
stink of the primeval Centralian is
exuded by a lifelong accumulation of per-
spiration, grease (rubbed in as a cleanser),
wood smoke, unwashed whisker, decayed
blood and other choice matters which
have been banished from the civilised
body since soap and razors became the
fashion. Many of our black brothers die
without having a bath. In consequence,
they smell exactly like some of our more
primitive white brothers in remoter Euro-
pean villages. Any scientist who wants to
write about it, however, need not go to
Centralia to investigate. Let him pur-
chase some old-fashioned blood-and-bone
manure and he will enjoy the true tribal
effluvia without suffering the hardships
of travel.
“Niffy”: Most of the natives of the
Western Pacific exhale the true “breath
of the Islands” of which writers burble so
much. This smell is a combination of
stale cocoanut oil and wood smoke, and
is as characteristic as the hum of “ghee”
and native tobacco which always sur-
rounds the low-caste Hindu. Stale dried
fish marks the Malay. A .naval uncle
much in China ports in the 1850’s-60’s
told me that Chinese above the coolie
class on approaching a European in the
street invariably drew their long sleeve
across the face and kept it there until
past him. It wasn’t until long after he
learned that this was not the studied
insult supposed, but a warding off of the
vile odor of the foreign devil.
SOCRATES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A Greek fruiterer named Socrates appeared as
defendant in a Melbourne breach-of-promise case.”
What’s in a name, seeing a rose by any
Would smell as sweet, as Avon’s bard
declares?
And yet it seems so strange so very many
Should fall so singularly short of theirs.
In book or play, in idyll or scenario,
Or any form of fiction that you please,
You never come across a gay Lothario
Baptismally entitled Socrates.
A cruel jolt upon an old ideal!
A jar on memories that stick and stir!
The devil of it is that only in real
Life such anomalies as these occur.
A Socrates to woo a trusting maiden
And let her down! I find such things as
these,
Unto a mind with Greek still lightly laden,
Quite incompatible with Socrates.
Stern old philosopher, in distant ages
The way to wisdom sturdily you showed;
Found it a thankless job, like other sages,
And ultimately hit the hemlock road."
To think a namesake, sans your stoic virtue,
Should e’er be mulct in damages and fees,
For breach of plighted promise, well may hurt
you
In your Elysian fields, my Socrates.
Yet, after all, if you had been more slippy,
You might conceivably have hit the breeze
Before she roped you in, that scold Xantippe?
We’ll let it go at that then, Socrates.

POLITICAL POINTS
Repenting of the uncivil things it has
published about him (or resenting its
Cobdenite rival’s championship of a
Protectionist), Melbourne “Age” has
made J. W. Leckie its second choice for
Senator, putting the Imperial Freetrader
Bob Elliott No. 1 and the Scullin
Laborite Jack Barnes No. 3. Truly an
amazing mixed grill. It suggests that,
if candidates had to be clergymen, the
“Age’s” ticket would be the Chief
Rahbi, Dr. Mannix and Rev. Albiston, of
the L.O.L.
The patriarchal Watson has suddenly
announced that he is not going to stand
for Fremantle again. This has flabber-
gasted the Nats.—they had made no
move to bring out a man—and delighted
Jack Curtin, whom Watson has twice
beaten. Fremantle was regarded as a
Labor seat till the bighearted old butter-
merchant came out.
Although Lang burns “to complete the
work of Federation by developing the
six States into one nation, with unified
control and authority,” he is not risking
defeat in the great cause. Let others do the
fighting—he finds it less exciting to lead
them from behind. True, at Beasley’s
policy-speech meeting the author of
“Why I Fight!” headed the van of the
Parliamentary army when it marched on
to the platform. Poor Beasley made his
entrance when the shouting had subsided
and the limelight spluttered out.
Since Lang began performing at radio
stations N.S.W. businessmen have had a
foretaste of what Langism would mean
in the Commonwealth sphere; and in-
vestors had their turn on Friday, when
Australian Consols flopped. At Mel-
bourne the 1951-53 issue fell £3 ss. to
£lO4 155., and the 1951-57 issue £3 7s. 6d.
to £lO4 10s. Beasley had read the
“greater-than-Lenin” Lang-Garden policy
the previous night.
J. D. Annand, the Mayor of Too-
woomba, is back in Queensland
Assembly, having repelled the efforts of
J. D. Kane to capture East T. for
Labor. Premier Forgan Smith, who
campaigned for Kane, claims a decided
swing to his party, since the late Roberts
had 800-odd votes to the good and
Annand fewer than 200. If Annand
and Roberts were Labor, Foregone
would be pointing out that general-
election majorities always dwindle at by-
elections.
One of those inspirations from the
blue burst on Queensland Labor just
before the East Toowoomba by-election,
when it was resolved to pay out forth-
with the balance of money owing to rail-
waymen from the defunct superannua-
tion fund —about £240,000. Toowoomba
is a big railway centre.
Dalgety’s “Review” reports that the
Australian wool clip for the 1933-34
season realised £52,165,700, an increase
of £17,122,700. This can’t be right, for,
according to Lang, “the European coun-
tries have adopted a policy which has
had the result of destroying our over-
seas markets.” Indeed he hired a chain
of radio stations at vast expense to un-
load a bundle of information bearing
the title “Why Our Overseas Markets
Cannot Be Recovered.” And Lang is
always Right.
After long-drawn-out proceedings be-
fore the Industrial Commission, some of
the Sydney taxgatherers have been
granted an award. Salaries range from
£304 to £675 p.a. (the average is about £9
a week) and officers are graded as
checkers, assessors, sub-assessors, section
leaders, permanent interviewers, chief in-
terviewers, rebate calculators and super-
visors of calculations. And all in one
branch of one State department!
Having enthusiastically seconded the
efforts of Labor-socialists to drive ’bus-
proprietors out of business, the anti-
Socialist Government at Sydney has
ordered another lot of socialistic ’buses.
Only the Reds of the transport unions
are rejoicing. When all means of trans-
port are Government-owned, what a
beautiful strike they will be able to have!
This time last year Wallace, the U.S.
Secretary for Agriculture, was saying to
the millers:
We are anxious to bring about this next
fall, and the following spring, and the next
year, and the next year, a curtailment of
acreage to adjust our wheat situation to
the world situation.
Nature has taken the matter into its own
hands. Now the gentleman is saying
that the drought will inevitably increase
food prices (and, incidentally, Govern-
ment expenditure, Government being a
huge buyer of food for the workless and
its labor battalions) and threatening that
“profiteering from the national calamity
will be ruthlessly dealt with.”
“It was most gratifying to hear Mr. utter the ringing challenge to the banks
which fitted his splendid oratory.”— Mr. Lang.
“You’ve a great voice, Jimmy, as I told you four years ago; but you’ll have to
make it a duet.”
If Lyons goes back Parliament is to
be asked to give the Minister of Cus-
toms power to negotiate trade treaties
“and put them into force immediately
by proclamation.” A country he won’t
need, to bother about is the U.S.A. Its
Trade Commissioner in Sydney, revisit-
ing San Francisco, blithely mentioned
that Uncle sold so much to the Com-
monwealth (“lumber, films, cars, fuel oil,
gasolene and other oil bv-products”) and
bought so little that a reciprocal trade
agreement wouldn’t be worth his while,
During the 14 years of Ryan, Theo-
dore, Gillies and McCormack, Queens-
land Labor did not elect one Senator,
and after the rout of 1925 Forde was
its only M.H.R.—one Commonwealth
member out of 16. In 1931, with the
“Tories” in office at Brisbane, it cap-
tured the three vacant Senate seats and
five of the ten in the House. Now it
is in control of the State Treasury
benches again, and the other side is
complacently quoting history. Com-
monwealth Labor candidates would
rather be standing after another three
years of Moore, but they protest that
Forgan Smith has stirred up none of the
ill-feeling that Theodore and McCormack
aroused, and that Lyons’s influence in
Queensland is not to be compared with
that of Bruce.
A thing that is telling against Queens-
land Labor candidates is that the party
executive -it Rrishane selected them Fnr
executive at Brisbane selected them For
the Senate Ucket its choice fell upon Lewis
McDonald (its secretary since 1910), R.
J. Carroll, secretary of the Amalgamated
Engineers, and F. P. J. Byrne, of the
Townsville Industrial Council. Even
trade-unionists have published protests
against this way of deciding the matter,
and it takes some courage to come out
against bossism in Queensland. The
Shop Assistants are particularly resent-
ful, and their executive hurled defiance
at the Q.C.E. when called to account by
that body.
In nine years Victoria has had one
surplus—£34,7so in 1928-29. If the
estimated deficit for 1934-35 is reached,
revenue account will have gone back
8| millions in a decade. Argyle says ne
outlook is hopeful, “though we cannot
afford to take any risks.” Tax-reduction
is one of them.
One of Tas. Labor’s election cries was
“Honesty in Public Finance.” Four days
before the close of the financial year it
transferred £40,000 from consolidated
revenue to a suspense account for expen-
diture in 1934-35. Now the Treasurer
is to get Commonwealth Bank accommo-
dation for a deficit of £146,000 (it was
originally fixed at £20,000), having
“placed before members of the Loan
Council reasons why an increase should
be permitted.” It is improbable that the
suspense-account transaction was one of
the “reasons.”
For remarks made about “Diver”
Hughes, sometime Labor M.L.A. for
East Perth, while Hughes was standing
for the Leg. Council, certain Fremantle
Trades-Hallers were fined in the police
court, and (along with a printer) cast in
£lOO damages by a Supreme Court jury.
On top of these blows, Gray, M.L.C.,
has been disqualified for two years by
the Fremantle magistrate. If the High
Court decides against Clydesdale, M.L.C.,
whom the Supreme Court (the State Full
Court concurring) ordered to pay Hughes
£2OO for holding an office of profit under
the Crown, he, too, will lose his seat.
Hughes has already taken a law course
at Perth Uni. When he gets admitted to
the profession he shouldn’t lack for
clients.
Arthur Griffith, who as Minister of
Works (1910-15) set his mark on N.S.W.
history, is out for Gwydir as a supporter
of Scullin. With Aubrey Abbott,
M.H.R., and a Langster against him, he
will have his work cut out, but he isn’t
worrying about that. Griffith was never
one to be daunted by an uphill fight.
J. J. Daly was branded as a coming
man when he stood for the Senate in
1928, and within a year he was leading
the Chamber for Scullin. He proved an
able leader, too —an old Parliamentary
hand, not of his party, told The
Bulletin he had never seen a young
politician stand up to an exacting task
better. But Daly paid for his fidelity to
Scullin by being expelled frond the A.L.P.
and he had to go to all sorts of trouble to
be reinstated. When the State party
split into four factions he sided with the
one that suffered most at the polls. Now
that “unity” has been “achieved”—in
proof of which three “comrades” are
coming out for Adelaide—Daly has been
left off the Senate ticket.
Littleton Groom has never changed
his opinions much, but he has changed
his label several times. He was a Pro-
tectionist at first, then a Deakinite
Liberal, then a Fusionist, then a Nation-
alist, then an Independent Nationalist—
at least, Morgan, who beat him for the
nomination and the Darling Downs seat,
called him that—and now U.A.P. His
leaders have been Barton, Deakin, Cook,
Hughes, Bruce and Lyons, and at one
time or another he has been opposed to
the last four.
A lawyer, D. J. R. Watson, is putting
up in the Labor interest against Hunter
in Maranoa (Q.), and his friends say
Hunter is as good as gone. Hunter must
be used to hearing this ; his defeat has
been positively announced in advance
ever since he succeeded the late Jim Page
in 1921. Really the distribution has
enhanced his prospects. About 12,000
electors have been transferred to
Maranoa from Wide Bay (Gayndah and
Nanango) and Darling Downs (Pitts-
worth), and not even in 1929 were there
Labor majorities there.
[Responsibility for Commonwealth-election
matter in this issue is shared by J. E. Webb,

street, Sydney.]

Australia will meet two wearers of
the Red Hat this year—Cardinal Mac-
Rory, the Papal Legate, and Cardinal
Villeneuve, of Quebec, who are attend-
ing the Melbourne Eucharistic Congress.
Cardinal Villeneuve is Canadian-born
and only 50 years of age, which makes
him the second-youngest cardinal in the
world.
Fairbairn, of Flinders, has a pull over
most participants in the election ram-
page. A war-time ace who has owned
a ’bus ever since he returned to Aus-
tralia, he is able to flit all over his
electorate. A grazier like most of the
Fairbairns, he is pushing the U.A.P.
cause against solicitor W. J. Fullerton,
a C.P. champion.
Harry Woods, Beasley’s U.A.P. oppo-
nent in West Sydney, though an em-
ployer preferred the presidency of the
Hat Makers’ Union to membership of
the Employers’ Assoc. Before a 40-hour
week was talked of he worked a five-
day week in his factory, and paid for 48
hours. Woods’s native town is Luton,
the English hat-making centre. He once
told a commission that “the Australian
is the finest workman in the world, and,
put on his honor, without spying, the
most honest.” He can give Priminister
Lyons points as a family man: he has
18 grandchildren.
T. C. ROUGHLEY, shark, goldfish and oyster expert.
“Bill” Dunstan, the new manager of
the “Herald” and “Weekly Times,” is the
first Australian V.C. to land a job of
anything like that magnitude. A fair,
stocky, keen-eyed customer, with an iron
jaw and a suave but decisive manner,
Dunstan has worked his way to the top
in face of heavy handicaps. He was
wounded in the head amongst other
places, and he hasn’t got over it yet. Dun-
stan won his V.C. on the Peninsula. He
is an accountant by profession, and one
of the best-liked members of Melbourne’s
big service club.
J. S. P. Bourne, a retired Queensland
civil servant, who celebrates his 83rd
birthday next month, saw the first rail-
way in Australia opened between Mel-
bourne and Port Melbourne in 1854, and
next year he was also taken to the open-
ing of the first line in N. S. Wales. He
joined the Lands Department when he
grew up, and rose to be Crown Lands
Commissioner.
The biggest testimonial to the late
G. F. Holden, chairman of Melbourne
Harbor Trust, was provided when
H. Renown berthed successfully at
Prince’s Pier in 1920 without bothering
to wait for high tide. Behind that
achievement were 10 years of striving by
Holden to turn Port Phillip into a
lffodern port. Holden began his public
career as M.L.A. for Warrenheip, and
represented the seat for 13 years.
Saddlers stay a long time in harness.
John Crane, of Tanunda (S.A.), is 87 ;
he learned his trade from his father, and
still takes an active part in the family
business. T. Connor, of Tocumwal
(Vic.), started as a saddler in Bourke-
street, Melbourne, at 14, and at 84 he is
still working.
The late W. H. Hodges, of Melbourne,
started the war-time land boom when he
cut up the estate of Judge Holroyd in
Prahra-n. Values leapt from 48s. to £l5
a foot in 18 months. Hodges was half a
century in the estate-agency business
which W.A., his father, founded 79 years
ago, and which W.H., a grandson, is
carrying on.
This is T. C.
Roughley, pre s i-
dent of the Royal
Zoological Society,
whom the Sydney
dailies always in-
terview when a
shark gets into the
news. What he
doesn’t know about
the 70 species of
shark that infest
our seas simply
isn’t kn o wledge.
He is also familiar
with the ways of
goldfish, and in
thousands of
homes his “The
Cult of the Gold-
fish” reposes be-
si d e the family
Bible. His “Life
Story of the
Oyster” earned
him his B.Sc. de-
gree at Sydney
Uni.
Mr s. Eamonn
O’Neill, who threw
herself between
police and farmers
at Cork last week,
was born in Gipps-
land, where her
father, D. D.
Hickey, now of
Perth, kept a store.
In 1916 Mrs.
O’Neill p 1 u n ged
vimfully into the
conscription cam-
paign, on the “No”
side. She is said to
have become a republican as the result
of a chance meeting with Michael Collins
in an Irish hospital. Her present, and
second, husband is a leader of the
United Ireland party and a Dail member.
“Jeames”: Haemophilia, which caused
the death of ex-King Alfonso’s fourth
son last week after a trifling motor
mishap, is the most fashionable of the
diseases. The Infante’s mother is George
V.’s cousin, but anything might befall a
descendant of Alfonso, whose heredity is
notoriously bad. However, haemophilia
has appeared in branches of the
British royal family. A descendant of
Prince Leopold, fourth son of Queen Vic-
toria, who was in Australia before the
war, had it; so had the butchered Czare-
vitch. Haemophilia has also made its
appearance in descendants of Queen Vic-
toria’s second son (Duke of Saxe-Coburg-
Gotha), who married into the Russian
royal family.

Dale Collins left
Melbourne a slim
and beautiful young
reporter; he re-
turned the other
day a confirmed
novelist, and when
Frith saw him at
Norman Lindsay’s
show he looked like
this. Collins
specialises in sea-
stories, and he fin-
ished another while
he was at Manly
Beach. “Vulner-
able” is the name,
and it has been
published by the
Macquarie Head

John Sulman,
who died on Satur-
day in his 85th
year, was best
known to the
general public as a
town-planner. He
got his K.B. for his
work at Canberra
as chairman of the
Federal Capital-
Advisory Board,
and he has taken
the lead in every
major move for re-
modelling of Syd-
ney since the City
Improvement Com-
mission was appointed owing to his
efforts in 1908. He began his career as
an architect in London (his birthplace)
in 1870, and settled in Sydney 15 years
later. He had been president of the
National Art Gallery for 15 years and
a member of the Union Club for 44
years.
The late William Freeman received the
imposing funeral which S.A. gives to
every military veteran. He was 104, and
alleged to be the last survivor of the
Crimean War.
Dead in S.A. after a long illness,
Ernest Marryat. He was a direct de-
scendant of the novelist, and son of a
long-ago Dean of Adelaide. He had
been master at both St. Peter’s and Mel-
bourne Grammar.
Carl Edlundh, of Caloundra (Q.), and
his wife claim that each of their nine
children was born in a lighthouse. Old
Carl first saw the light in Sweden 77
years ago. He went to sea at 12 and
joined the Q. Lighthouse Service at Bris-
bane in 1882. After serving all along
the coast, he opened the first lighthouse
at Caloundra in 1896, and remained in
charge for over 20 years.
Dr. Bridges, new senior physician at
Royal North Shore Hospital, could earn
his living with his pen if he wanted a
change from medicine. He was born in
Adelaide in 1888, went to school at St.
Peter’s and graduated at Sydney Uni. He
held various jobs at R.P.A. Hospital
before going to R.N.S. The Bridges
family has old associations with Sydney ;
the doctor’s father was g.m. of the
A.M.P., and his grandfather was N. S.
Wales Director of Education.
“Ike Hollar”: So the Australian-born
faith-healer James Hickson has left
£30,000! Hickson claimed to have dedi-
cated his life to the poor and suffering,
but he was careful to stay at the most
comfortable hotels. There were pathetic
sights in Australian cities when the sick
and the halt came, or were carried, to
him 10 years ago. Not the least remark-
able of his gifts was the capacity to in-
duce archbishops to give him patronage
as well as patients.
DALE COLLINS, novelist, who is returning to England
this week.
Anthony Fokker, whose sneer at the
centenary air race (“Only one man will
benefit: the chocolate-maker who is giv-
ing the prizes”) has caused considerable
ill-feeling, doesn’t love Australia. A
Dutchman by birth, he was in Germany
when the war began ; his fighting 'planes
gave the Germans a big advantage for
some time, and if the Allies had been
defeated he would have been able to
name his own honors and emoluments in
Berlin. Fokker saw inflation coming
before 1923, sold out his German
interests, and returned to Holland, but
he spends more time in America than
Europe these days.
Francis Joseph Lyons, just dead in
Vancouver, was a leading criminal
lawyer in that part of the world. He
came originally from Maryborough (Q.)
and practised at the N. S. Wales Bar till
he left for B.C. at the age of 41 20 years
ago.
“Dutch Hoe”: E. N. Ward, late curator
of Sydney Botanic Gardens, was a
Bradman fan though an Englishman by
birth. On Saturday he vowed he would
stand by the wireless till the champion
scored 200 or got out, and he collapsed
just as the synthetic cheers from the radio
studio came through. Ward arrived in
Australia 40 years ago, and held many
jobs under Victorian and N.S.W. Govern-
ments before taking over the Botanic
Gardens from Maiden. An enthusiastic
landscaper, he advised on the laying out
of dozens of big Sydney places. He
helped largely to eliminate the old prim
straight-edged effects in gardens; they
were even to be found in the Botanic
Gardens before his arrival.

This co. has a record it can be proud of.
Formed in 1920, it now supplies over
half the total corset requirements of the
Australian market. Meanwhile, the
subsidiaries formed in Vic. and Maori-
land have grown into lusty youngsters,
and the one which recently set up
a factory at Slough (Eng.) may yet
develop into a bigger concern than the
parent. The success of the undertaking
has been due largely to the energy
and foresight of its governing director,
Fred Burley. The foundations of much
future business were laid about eight
years ago, when, to further improve the
design and fit of its garments, the co.
organised an anthropometrical survey of
Australian women. From the data ob-
tained its medical advisers evolved a
number of standard types; then a
mechanical type indicator was devised,
enabling both the co. and retailers to
give better service.
Since 1926 the ords. have averaged
8.6 p.c., the lowest being 7.5 p.c., despite
slump. During the last term there was
a steady increase in sales, especially in
the second half. This was accompanied
by an all-round reduction in exes., in-
cluding taxation, interest and bad debts,
and the Victorian offshoot sent along a
little more. After handing the staff
£lB3O (£1645 in the previous year) in
profit-sharing divs., and the prefs. their
£4OOO, enough remained to show 11.3
p.c. on ord. capital as against 8.2, 8.7,
10.9, 7.4 and 11.2 p.c. back to 1929. That
leaves out of the reckoning £l5OO
dropped from somewhere into reserves.
The div. was kept at 8 p.c.

ducted from the asset in the published

tShares in subsidiaries.
Taken in conjunction with the rest of
the figures, the year’s reduction of
£14,569 in debtors’ balances is encourag-
ing, and so is the spring of £25,909 in
shares in subsidiaries. It reflects the con-
tinued expansion of Berlei (U.K.), Ltd.,
which made a small trading loss —it is
always expensive to . establish a new line
in a highly-competitive market—but
sales took a big leap. The Maoriland
subsidiary made further progress, and
continues to pay a steady div.
The market prices both prefs. and
ords.—there are 50,000 prefs., carrying a
fixed cumulative 8 p.c.—at 30s. 6d. The
return at that figure- is 5.2 p.c. on the
basis of last year’s distribution. The
net tangible cover is £4 12s. 6d. prefs.
and 265. 4d. ords.

Well ribbed financially and with every-
thing right on the technical side, this
Bundaberg milling and refining co. —it
took over the sugar interests that fell
into the Q.N. Bank’s hands in the
’nineties —is well equipped to harvest
whatever profits are to be had from the
industry. The loss in 1933 (the first thing
of its kind) was due to a dry spell, fol-
lowed by severe frosts, which greatly
reduced crushings (27,000 tons). The
quantity of cane put through the rollers
during the last term is not stated in the
report, but the co. expected to deal with
130,000 tons, and probably handled more.
Total Australian production of raws
was the biggest yet, being 134,000 tons
better than for the ’32 season, and 62,000
tons above the previous peak figure for

Last season’s exports averaged £8 os. 6d.
as against £8 ss. 9d. and £9 7s. for the
two preceding years. The drop in the
Australian price is due to the cut of
id. per pound in the retail price of fines.
After striking off an extra £1206 for
depreciation (£19,152), the year’s* net
result was 12.6 p.c. on capital as against
a loss, 13.2, 13, 12.5, 12.4 and 11.9 p.c.
back to 1928. A bonus of 1 p.c. was
sent out with the final div:, making 7 p.c.
for the year, and an average of 9.4 p.c.
over the last decade.
For the current season production is
expected to approximate last year’s
record figure. The market, doubtful as
to what the future may hold for the
industry, prices the pound shares at 30s.
6d., at which figure the return is 4.6 p.c.
on a 7 p.c. div. basis. The cover is 30s.
4d. in net tangibles.

A feature which catches the eye is the
fine wad of investments (up £78,220 last
year), believed to consist largely of Gov-
ernment securities. The years’ improve-
ment in the more or less liquid surplus
(£356,578, including stocks) was £46,528.

Conditions for this co. were mixed last
year. In S. Aus. fewer acres were planted
with wheat, the average yield was lower,
due to absence of rain on the seed-
beds, and the already disastrously low
price shrank a bit more, as the following
table shows:

It all meant that less superphosphate was
bought by wheatgrowers, despite help
from the Farmers’ Assistance Board and
the Federal Government’s subsidy on
artificial manures. There was a better
demand for the co.’s product as top-
dressing, thanks to the lift in the price
of wool, and gross earnings (£32,417)
were £1624 better. But exes. (£18,775)
took all the increase and £416 besides,
leaving the net result a wink over 4 p.c.
on capital as against'4.l, 4.2, 4.1, 4.7,
7.2 and 8.2 p.c. back to 1928. The div.
was kept at 4 p.c.
Financially, the co. is in a position to
take care of more business than it has
recently handled:

Last year £9282 was added to the mod-
erate debt, stocks were £9953 lighter, and
fixed assets were down £3036, while cash,
etc., was strengthened by £22,450. The
improvement in the more or less liquid
surplus (£216,824) was £3201.
As for the current term, demand for
super, from pastoral areas may lose a
little of its strength, and it is doubtful
whether there will be much increase in
the area under wheat. The brightest spot
in the picture is the rise in the price of
grain, due mainly to lighter crops in
Canada and the U.S.A., though it hasn’t
all held. After touching 3s. 7d. a bushel
f.o.r. Port Adelaide, the best since Nov.,
1931, the figure fell to 3s. 3d. last week-
end.
The market prices the pound shares at
18s. lid. The return at that figure is
4.2 p.c. on a 4 p.c. div. basis. The cover
is 255. 6d. in net tangibles.

This co., whose 36-mile track links up
Broken Hill with the S. Aus. railway
system at Cockburn, has been hauling
concentrates, mining requisites and pas-
sengers, etc., for the last 48 years. Dur-
ing that time it has distributed £437,200
of bonus scrip, raising paid capital to
£500,000, of which £150,000 was re-
turned in cash a couple of years ago,
reducing the figure to £350,000. But the
past is no guide to the future, which
depends upon the life of the big silver-
lead mines at the Barrier —probably 20
years or more, subject to the course of
metal prices, exchange and costs. To
provide for the return of capital a special
reserve has been created, into which
£12,500 was tossed last year, lifting it
to £80,727 (= nearly 25 p.c. of present
capital), and the money has been in-
vested in Government securities.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures show it:
1918. 1932. 1933. 1934.
Paid capital.. £250,000 £500,000 £350,000 £350,000

The year’s surplus earnings and a re-
duction of £7233 in debtors’ balances
enabled £ll,OlO to be clipped off the
amount coming to sundry creditors and
£12,000 to be added to Government
securities (£84,020, face value). The im-
provement in the more or less liquid sur-
plus (£95,022, excluding stores) was
£19,503.
There was a spring of 39,998 tons in
the quantity of goods carried, due
mainly to a better outturn of concen-
trates at the Barrier:

Gross earnings (£129,661) moved up
£6638, and exes. (£82,870) took £3034 of
the increase. Taking unexplained move-
ments in reserves into the reckoning, the
net result was £4404 better at' 14.8 p.c.
on capital as against 13.6, 8.5 and 10.6
p.c. for the three preceding years. Divs.
totalled 10.7 p.c., or three times more
than for the previous term, and another
5.3 p.c. is to be sent out on Aug. 29.
Subject chiefly to output at the mines,
prospects of the co. being able to return
all its capital and continue paying good
divs. appear to be bright enough. The
market, therefore, prices the fully-paid
14s. shares at 255. 3d., giving a gross
yield of 5.9 p.c. on a 10.7 p.c. div. basis.
On the same basis, and allowing 6d. per
share per annum for return of the pre-
mium at which the scrip now stands in
the market, the net interest, return would
be a shade under 4 p.c.

Slump and moratorium legislation have
given this and other discount and finance
cos. whose shock-absorbers were rather
weak a nasty jolt. Still, by taking a clear
view of the position and dealing promptly
with its problems, the board has made
available for dividends profits which
would otherwise be required to replace
capital that had been lost. Thus only
once (in 1931) have shareholders gone
without, though they have suffered in
other respects.
Formed in 1926, the co. put out
396,215 £1 shares, which were paid to
14s. Preliminary exes, made off with
£40,373. The business kept on quicken-
ing its step for the first four years ; then,
with the change in outlook, Is. per share
(£19,811) was returned in cash, 2s.
(£39,621) was struck off in order to wipe
out intangibles, and the uncalled 6s. on
each share was cancelled. In ’3l and ’32,
2\ p.c. was paid out of current earnings,
and a little was put on the shelf. But
the fall in the value of real estate wiped
out the margin on some of the co.’s
securities, and the N. S. Wales mora-
torium extinguished the personal covenant
in mortgages. To bring the book
value of the assets into line with what is
reckoned to be their actual worth on
a conservative estimate, another 3s.
(£59,432) was struck off each share dur-
ing the last term, reducing paid capital
to £158,486 in fully-paid Bs. shares. In
addition, the general reserve (£9107) dis-
appeared ; bad debts had been previously
made a direct charge against this account.
During the 12 months to mid 1933,
operations were extended to Victoria and
Maoriland, and a branch has since been
opened in Brisbane. This and the re-
vival in the motor trade enabled the board
to find employment for £47,315 of the
co.’s own cash and an extra £29,569 of
outside money as well: —

Owing to the writings-off already re-
ferred to, the year’s net increase in the
book value of advances was only £8145,
making the figure £178,463, equal to
approximately six times the amount
coming to outsiders. The nature of the
shareholdings is not disclosed.
Net earnings nearly doubled, reaching
6.9 p.c. on capital as it now stands, and
5 p.c. ( = 2.8 p.c. on original cash paid
capital) was distributed.
Though visible reserves (£5399) are
small, the market notes that the chief
obstacles to the co.’s recovery have been
removed. It therefore prices the scrip
at 7s. sd. The return at that figure is
5.4 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis, and the
cover Bs. 3d. in net tangibles.

Considering the number of lions in its
path, this eight-year-old has put up a
very satisfactory performance, thanks
largely to its 65,000-tons-p.a. contract
with the N. S. Wales Government, re-
newed in Sept., 1930, which runs
out again in a couple of months. Un-
expectedly heavy outlay on equipment
threw estimates askew at the start, but
this and other difficulties were soon over-
come. There has been an uninterrupted
flow of divs. over the last six years
(average 6.5 p.c.), with satisfactory mar-
gins. These and allowances for depre-
ciation (£25,000 p.a.) together approxi-
mate distributions to date. The co. has
thus been able to reduce the debt and
accumulate cash, and so place itself in
a better position to compete in a crowded
market: —•

Last year £7693 was added to the amount
coming to sundry creditors, which in-
cludes provision for taxation, and the
book value of fixed assets was reduced
by £27,231, while debtors’ balances
(£41,797) increased by £11,385 and the
cash holding (£132,134) by £50,147. The
improvement in the more or "less liquid
surplus (£171,285, including stocks but
not shares) was £48,948.
With the help of more Government
and other orders during the last term,
net earnings, which shot up £13,856,
were the best yet, being 11.3 p.c. on capi-
tal as against 8.5, 4.4, 7.9, 9.5 and 9.4
p.c. back to 1929. The div. was ad-
vanced from 6 p.c. to 1\ p.c., the final
being at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a.
The public works programme and re-
vival in the building trade favor main-
tenance of satisfactory earnings for the
current term, though much depends upon
the renewal and terms of the contract
already referred to. Also, the industry
generally is overcapitalised. Hence the
market prices the pound shares at 18s.
6d. as against 16s. 9d. a year ago. The
return at the higher figure is 8.1 p.c. on
a 1\ p.c. div. basis. The cover is 235. 6d.
in net tangibles, mainly fixed assets,
worth what they can earn.

How much to expect in
BONUSES
THE large sums allotted each year in the form of bonuses
by the A.M.P. Society excite comment and enquiry on all
hands. For last year the sum was £4,773,000 (slightly
bigger than the previous year). This was large enough to
enable an average of 9/4 in each £ of the premiums on par-
ticipating policies in the Ordinary Department to be returned in
bonuses. A great achievement, and one that prompts men to
say: How much can we expect in bonuses in future?
The A.M.P. is a mutual society. It belongs to the members
absolutely. It exists to assure their lives at the lowest possible
net cost. The surplus each year, after providing for all contin-
gencies, is divided amongst the participating members in exact
actuarial proportion. What that surplus will be depends, each
year, on the earnings of the Society’s investments, on the cost
of conducting the Society’s enterprise, and on the careful
selection of members.
How do these bonuses work out? Take this typical example:—
Table A. Policy for £l,OOO.
Policy effected in 1891 when the member was 32 years of age.

Reversionary bonuses in force to 31/12/’33 . . 1,342 4 0
Sum now assured . . . . . . . . • • £2,342 4 0
Is it any wonder that the Society has over a million policies in force,
assuring to members a total of £220,170,041? It is a wise man who
shelters his family and himself under the wing of the Society. There
is no safer or surer way of investing his savings or surpluses.
An experienced counsellor will be sent to discuss this protection with
any citizen on request.

After a little delay, due to water, now
cemented off, the New Gympie Co.’s
shaft on the Great Northern area. Gym-
pie (Q.), is down 200 ft. In the last 10
of them a 4ft.-wide formation, consist-
ing of chlorite and quartz carrying a lot
of iron pyrites, was cut. The shaft is
expected to continue in conglomerates
until the Phoenix slates are met with at
about 400 ft. The first attempt to prove this
area was made by the old Great North-
ern Co. between 1906-14, when over
3000 oz. of gold was taken from about
as many tons of stone. The shaft, how-
ever, was sunk in an area almost barren
of reefs (one in 1000 ft.) and too close to
the Lady Mary crosscourse. The work
was carried out by W. H. Reeve, who is
now directing the operations of the New
Gympie. The area had been marked
down as barren by early miners because
there was no surface gold. But there
was a rush for leases a year or so ago,
following the report of J. H. Reid, Senior
Government Geologist, that a dome in
the plumbago beds prevented their out-
crop in this area, where Gympie Gold,
a Sydney concern, is also installing plant.
The Gympie Dredging Co. is still boring
along the west bank of the Mary River,
and results are said to be encouraging.

Water at the rate of 1,100,000 gallons
a day is being pumped from the Bird-in-
Hand into the Onkaparinga River (S.
Aus.), thereby supplementing the depleted
supply in the Happy Valley Reservoir.
It was the inflow that stopped work on
this dividend-payer of some 30 years
ago. The level has now been low-
ered by 190 feet (the pump set
in on June 16), and a further re-
duction of 60 feet will clear the 350-
foot level, the lowest at which ore was
extracted. At this point 4400 tons aver-
aged over 13dwt. without cyanide. At
the 400-foot level the main lode was
reported to be 20 feet wide, assaying
15dwt. The Government bore showed
this width to be maintained at 600
feet, where the core assayed 9.2Bdwt.
A second lode, 44 inches wide, aver-
aging 12dwt., was also revealed by
the bore at 550 feet. A plant to treat
1500 tons monthly, with provision for
extension as development proceeds, is
to be installed.

New Venture, a Westralian prospect-
ing co., finished its first 8| months to
March 31 with £8341 in the bank ; there
was £1376 coming to outsiders. Sale of
leases, etc., turned in £2403, and exes.,
including inspection, sampling, etc., of
options in which co. now has no interest,
took £1295 more than that. Outlay on
current working options figures at £5093,
and flotation exes, at £l3lB. Paid capital
is £15,000 in 300,000 4s. shares paid to
Is. During the term Western Gold was
launched and took over the Sadie and
Turn of the Tide at Kunanalling. The
parent holds a par option (it may soon
be exercised to provide cash for plant)
over 20,000 of the pup’s 4s. shares paid
to 25., which are at a premium in the
market. Since the close of accounts a
subsidiary, Coolgardie Brilliant, has
taken over the Brilliant and Richmond
leases at Coolgardie. At the same centre
the Black Prince has been optioned to
a local syndicate; a new boiler and
Cameron pump are expected to overcome
the water trouble at the Redemption;
little work has been done on the Re-
demption Extended. The Kapai, Kal-
goorlie, is under offer to “a powerful
group.” At Grossmont the Asteroid failed
to respond to development. The rule is
now being run over the Birthday Gift
and Lady Robertson at Burbanks.

Great things are expected from the
new process evolved by Victor Edquist,
superintendent of the Sons of Gwalia
(W.A.). Metallurgists inside and outside
Australia, especially those connected
with low-grade mines, are interested.
Edquist’s long suit is the satisfactory re-
covery of the yellow metal from
materials which jib at flotation, decan-
tation or filtration. Savings are said to
range from 2s. to 6s. a ton. Results from
a bulk parcel of ore from Mt. Morgan
(Q.), treated by the experimental plant
at the Gwalia, are reported to have been
impressive. A Gwalia metallurgist is
now attached to the staff at Mt. Morgan
The north end of the Kalgoorlie
Golden Mile (W.A.), especially that part
adjacent to the town site on the east, is
receiving more attention than it has had
for many years. It was here that nearly
a quarter of a million pounds was taken
out of the Hannan’s Reward-Mt. Char-
lotte group, nearly £lOO,OOO worth of
gold and silver was extracted from an
isolated and short-lived telluride shoot
in the Hidden Secret, and returns from
three or four other claims ran into five
figures. Now an option over the
Hannan’s Reward-Mt. Charlotte has been
taken by a Melbourne syndicate, in
which Collins House is interested.
Almost-forgotten Hampton Gold Min-
ing Areas has just issued a report, show-
ing a loss of £7BB on the year’s opera-
tions. This unlucky concern was an
early 1920 Hampton Plains (W.A.) float
out of the office of Lionel Robinson,
Clark and Co., London. Once the Hamp-
ton Uruguay, it stood as a venerable
relic of the Kalgoorlie Golden Mile
boom until the opening up of Hampton
Celebration gave it second wind. The
co. isued 400,000 £1 shares, more than
half of which went to the old Uruguay
crowd. The White Hope and Golden
Hope cos. held leases on the areas, but
these became worthless with gold at its
statutory price, and both cos. gave up.
Great Boulder took an option on the
White Hope blocks some months ago,
and is doing some boring there.
Wilunas have added to their admirers
on the strength of an early div. announce-
ment and a report that holders will
shortly be offered scrip in a subsidiary
to take over the northern blocks, in-
cluding the Bulletin lease, where encour-
aging developments have occurred. Ore
in sight in the main workings is sufficient
for many years’ work at the present rate
of extraction.

Westralia Mt. Morgans (W.A.), re-
cently taken over by a co. formed in
Adelaide, was bossed in the dying days
of the nineteenth and the early years of
this century by the late A. E. Morgans
on behalf of a London co. It had a 60-
head mill, and produced over 1| million
pounds’ worth of gold. Then impover-
ishment occurred at depth, and after
holding a clearing sale the co. gave up.
Later a small Westralian syndicate took
possession, and stayed until the present
co. arrived.

to develop the old Mt. Ida Consols mine
at Mt. Ida, west of Leonora (W.A.).
Capital is £2OOO in ss. shares. The pro-
perty has been opened up to 210 ft., and
a large body of ore exposed. A new
formation has been struck 120 ft. south

Prospectors in Westralia have again
complained about large auriferous areas
being held by speculators, and the
Minister for Mines has again replied that
(1) the reservations are temporary,
holders having a limited time in which
to prospect and take up leases ; (2) the
holders of the reservations have already
spent a lot of capital thereon, thus giving
employment to hundreds of men; and
(3) where reservations have been can-
celled or abandoned there has been no
rush to peg. One reservation about
which a hullabaloo was recently raised
hadn’t been seriously worked for 30
years until the present holder came along.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department .)
(1) What kind of country is wolfram found
in, and how does it occur? (2) Appearance,
specific gravity, etc. ? (3) Chemical test ?
2842.
(1) The mineral wolframite, commonly called
wolfram, is found almost exclusively in associa-
tion with granitic rocks; in veins in granite or
in the rocks which granitic intrusions have
invaded. Being heavy, comparatively hard,
and relatively insoluble, it is also found in allu-
vial deposits derived from the veins, and is
often associated with tin oxide. The veins
consist of quartz in .most cases, and there
may be such minerals as molybdenite, arseni-
cal pyrites, iron pyrites, bismuth and cassite-
rite (tin oxide) associated with the wolframite.
(2) A black mineral, the color of the powder
being dark brown, with a somewhat reddish
tint in many cases. Specific gravity is over
seven, but the stuff can be scratched with a
knife. There is a well-marked cleavage, which
produces flat surfaces on broken specimens. (3)
Take a fragment of the mineral no bigger
than the head of a match, crush it, and fuse
the powder in a bead of sodium carbonate
(or bicarbonate) in a platinum wire loop before
the blowpipe. After fusion, the bead should be
dropped into a hot solution of hydrochloric
(muriatic) acid, mixed with an equal amount of
water, and heat applied until the bead dis-
solves. Granulated zinc or tinfoil, when
dropped into the solution, produces a deep
indigo-blue color.

“Catherine the Great”
The Bulletin, alone among Austra-
lian papers, damned British films freely
when they were bad ; now that many are
excellent it takes additional pleasure in
being able to say so. “Catherine the
Great,” pre-shown at Western Electric’s
Sydney theatrette, is a model produc-
tion in most respects. It is entirely
cosmopolitan, having Korda as producer
and a German girl, an Englishwoman
and an American man in the leading
roles. Elizabeth Bergner retains her
German accent as Catherine 11., which
is as it should be, and Douglas
Fairbanks, jun., as Peter, has a cultivated
English voice, which is also as it should
be. After this picture it is doubtful if
Hollywood will ever again make a period
film featuring royalties who speak with
American voices. Dialects, whether
American, Australian or' English, are
strangely out of place at royal courts.
The Messalina of the North appears
first just before her marriage to Peter,
and her development from a shy girl
to a resolute woman is suggested. But
she is shown through a glamorous veil
which obscures the fact that she was a
hardened profligate at least 10 years be-
fore her husband was put out of the
way. Neither she nor Fairbanks gets
older in looks during the 17 years they
spend together. Fairbanks’s Peter might
have been a great portrait if he had had
the courage to show the ravages of drink
and insanity on the face and figure of
youth. Flora Robson is the gem of the
piece. Her Catherine I. —bold, vulgar and
lecherous ; an elderly adventuress whose
past life is revealed in every line of her
face and inflection of her voice—is per-
haps the most intelligent and consistent
historical study that has been seen on a
screen. What a film this would have
been if the other principals had been
half as honest!
The story ends with the removal of
Peter and the beginning of the Orloff
affair—Gregory Orloff being represented
as a sentimentalist with a public-school
manner! The settings and dresses are
superb in their beauty and realism.
“Such Women Are Dangerous”
A Regent film. As a writer of best-
sellers Warner Baxter lives luxuriously
in an art moderne flat and wears the
natty gent.’s suitings which have figured
in so many previous films —notably the
pepper-and-salt lounge and the waisty full
e.d.s. with spacious tails and wide lapels.
The combination is too much for
Rochelle Hudson, a neurotic flapper.
After an ineffectual attempt to ruin him
she writes a letter: “If you are not at
our cottage of dreams by midnight”
Shortly afterwards he is accused of mur-
dering her, and is only acquitted by
the providential appearance of the letter,
which, of course, he never received. Is
it necessary to add that the missing words
are “I will kill myself”?
A boring picture, partly because most
of it features three girls fighting for one
elderly man, and partly because the
spectator foresees the answer to each of
its problems as they arise. Mona Barrie
is effective as the wise typist who is the
veteran hero’s inevitable choice.
“George White’s Scandals”
Another backstager. Some impres-
sions which the writer carried away were
forests of waving female legs ; Jimmy
Durante grinning without his trousers ;
more legs ; Rudy Vallee whimpering pas-
sionately against a background of prac-
tically naked girls ; Cliff Edwards knock-
ing Vallee senseless; Jimmy Durante
with his face blacked but recognisable
by his grin ; Alice Faye and Adrienne
Ames looking lovelorn, bored, angry,
happy and so on in gorgeous clothes, by
way of contrast to the whirling, swaying,
kicking cohorts of young women round
them. They seemed to get nearer to nature
than ever as the evening wore on, and
Jimmy Durante grinned indefatigably,
and Edwards and Vallee grappled with
each other on the floor. The finish came
in the form of what used to be known
as a Grand Transformation Scene. The
writer has to admit that he extracted his
hat from the debris of empty ice-cream
buckets, discarded pieces of chewing-
gum and mislaid chocolates under the
seat with a sigh of relief. If the screen
has anything more boring to offer than
naked choruses it is surely backstagers.
“Most Precious Thing in Life”
A mother-love movie at the State.
It begins with the marriage of a col-
lege football champion to a waitress.
The groom’s purse-proud parents succeed
in driving the mother of their little
grandson out of the family, and 20 years
later we meet her scrubbing floors and
making beds in the college of which her
husband was once an ornament. Enter
her son, a self-opinionated ass. She
reforms him, and everybody is happy.
Jean Arthur makes the charlady
an appropriately snivelling character;
Richard Cromwell plays her son.

other than A. A. Milne’s “The Dover

“She Made Her Bed”
Sally Eilers was unfortunate in marry-
ing Robert Armstrong, his failings being
a roving eye, a liking for whisky and a
craze for training wild animals at her
auto camp. His derelictions are bravely
borne by Sally until one of the tigers
escapes and tries to eat the baby.
She then elopes with a purveyor of snake
oil (Richard Arlen). Scenes with tiger
are exciting, but the rest of the action
drags. To be seen'at. Sydney*Capitol.
“Whirlpool”
Jack Holt gets 20 years, for man-
slaughter a few days after marrying Lila
Lee. So that his wife and child may
make a fresh start, he fakes evidence
that he tried to escape and was drowned
in the gaolside whirlpool. When he gets
out he becomes, in the fascinatingly easy
film manner, a rich and influential citizen
of New York —a “kingpin gambler.” He
is to provide an alibi for another rich
and influential citizen, but his daughter,
now stepchild of a Judge and sob-sister
of a daily, recognises him. If Holt gets
into the public eye as an alibi witness
his wife will know it and her home life
will be wrecked. Problem: What should
a regular guy do? Answer: (1) Decline
to testify, (2) shoot the New York lawyer
engaged by the other gang, (3) shoot
himself. These things Mr. Holt does
after spending a considerable time
cuddling his newly-found daughter (Jean
Arthur), to the annoyance of her young
man (Donald Cook). Holt strolls
through the maze of improbabilities with
his customary insouciance.
“Marooned”
A lighthouse melodrama, at the
Embassy. It was filmed mainly on the
Cornish coast, and there are some im-
pressive shots of storm-battered cliffs
and the lighthouse half-submerged in
foam and spray. The lighthouse-keeper
is concealing an escaped convict whom
he believes to be the father of'his
adopted daughter. A storm blows up, and
several people, including an officious
bobby, are marooned on the lighthouse
for days. Edmund Gwenn as the wor-
ried lighthouse-keeper acts with his usual
finish, and Wally Patch is a traditional
English policeman—suspicious, deter-
mined and slow in the uptake.
“For Love of You”
At Melbourne Athenaeum we find
another European tenor rescued from the
obscurity of the concert platform, given
an expensive frame and an idiotic story
and let loose on the screen to warble
those hardy operatic annuals which the
butcher-boy whistles on his rounds after
every Australian grand-opera season.
The vocalist in question is Franco
Foresta, the frame is Venice in carnival
time, and the story concerns Diana
Napier as the disgruntled English spouse
of the alien r songster. Shocked to the
depths of his British soul 'by the fur-
riner’s, goings-on, Arthur Riscoe indulges
in a low-comedy flirtation with the lady,
and a reconciliation is effected. Foresta
has a good though not outstanding
tenor, and the shots of the Bride of the
Adriatic on the spree are interesting.
“The House of Trent”
Dr. Trent loses . his life in saving that
of the infant daughter of Lord Fairdown,
the eminent newspaper magnate. In due
course his son, John .Stuart, a rising
young surgeon, neglects his duty at a
leading London hospital to keep a date
with the daughter (Wendy Barrie). A
patient under his care succumbs in his
absence, and Lord Fairdown launches
a press campaign to deliver the culprit
to justice, purge British society of grave
abuses and increase the circulation of
his paper. When be learns that the son
of the man who saved his daughter’s life
is the surgeon in the case he calls the
campaign off and leaves British society to
wallow in its iniquity in the interests
of sentimental melodrama. At the

Florence Austral will linger in the
memory of Sydney music-lovers not only
for her beautiful voice but for the gener-
ous proportions of her programmes. In
her second recital she drew upon Schu-
mann, Brahms and Richard Strauss, and
included a group of the songs of Hugo
Wolf, so often praised, so seldom sung.
Operatic fare was an aria from Verdi's
long-forgotten “Nabucco” and the mad
scene from “Lucia.” On Saturday, in
addition to Brahms and Schubert, there
were groups of English and French
songs, the prayer from “Der Freischutz”
and Brunnhilde’s battle-cry, while among
the encore numbers Lucia’s dementia and
Alfred Hill’s “Waiata Poi” were included.

Sydney’s Music Week starts on Satur-
day. Principal ingredients this year are
the Eisteddfod, which will run till Sep-
tember 8 and occupy eight halls while it
sifts the merits of nearly 10,000 com-
petitors. The imported lion of the period
will be pianist Leif Pouishnoff, who is
credited with a determination to play all
the works of Chopin. Various other
concerts have been arranged, and at
Anthony Horderns’ there will be a musi-
cale at three every afternoon from Mon-
day to Friday, under the direction of
Madame Emily Marks, founder of
Music Week, and Arnold Mote, this
year’s president.

The latest darling of the intellectual
drama movement is Benn W. Levy, whose
“The Devil Passes” received a better pre-
sentation than it deserved at Melbourne
Garrick last Saturday. Levy has con-
fected some entertaining stuff, such as
“This Woman Business” and “Topaz,”
though he has never shown any great
knowledge of theatrical values. He ex-
hibits some knack for hitting off odd bits
of characterisation, but it is as the play-
wright of ideas that he aspires to be
known to posterity. In the present opus
he endeavors to work out a Socratic
argument. The result of much mis-
placed ingenuity is a convincing demon-
stration that, whatever he is, Levy is no
Socrates. A Shaw might have made
something out of the situation in which
the Devil, masquerading as a curate, in-
vites eight assorted specimens of the
British intelligentsia to express their dear-
est wish, and then tempts them along the
lines of their desires in order to show
that, after all, hell’s standards of
morality are indistinguishable from those
of the London Tract Society. There is
engaging comedy in the spectacle of the
Devil offering a writer who yearns for
fame an unpublished manuscript of
Joseph Conrad and inviting him to print
it under his own name ; of him embrac-
ing a young lady who desires a deep and
satisfying passion ; of him showing an
actress who wishes to play Lady Mac-
beth how to break a contract, and so
forth ; but Mr. Levy appears to have got

It might interest you to know that I
saw a number of Bulletin drawings re-

Compliment from Canowindra
At the last meeting of the Canowindra
(N.S.W.) sub-branch of the Returned
Soldiers’ League I was instructed to
convey to you the deep appreciation of
all members for your continual good
work for and generous treatment gener-
ally of the Diggers.—C. W. Newton,
Hon. Sec.
Jobs for Lads
We of the Boys’ Employment League
(W.A.) can furnish proof that over 4000
positions have been found for lads in 32
months’ active work; and the League
has reason to believe that its placements
are from 10 p.c. to 15 p.c. understated.
Approximately 3000 boys are in rural
occupations. No case of adult displace-
ment is known to the League; rather
has increased adult employment occurred
because of the bulk employment of boys.
The League could have done more, and
with greater promptitude, if it had been
less hampered financially. In that respect
it has fared ill. — Fred T. Cross, secre-
tary (W.A.).
Costs in Tasmania
Total amount cjaimed for costs in a
Tas. will case was £752 ,7s. 3d. The tax-
ing officer knocked off £4lO 10s. Bd.; yet
the people from whom the legal gentle-
man asked £752 have to pay for getting
the account taxed. Indeed, they have to
find 30 per cent, bonus on the
taxed costs—another £96 3s.
sd. This bonus was granted
by the Supreme Court during
the financial frenzy, and it has
continued throughout the depression. It
should, of course,"-be abolished, and
abolition should present no great diffi-
culty, since some of the leading barris-
ters in Tasmania are Parliamentarians.
Solicitors are not given a bonus on taxed
costs ; the privilege is reserved for bar-
risters. — Ben (Tas.). ■»
Chain Stores in Maoriland
British Co-ops.? “Tick-Tock” (B.
18 /7 / ’34) knows" nothing about them.
They carry comprehensive stocks of
quality goods (too good, some of them,
for the Maoriland market, which gener-
ally demands the best). -The C.W.S. pays
first-rate wages and gives its customers a
yearly dividend—3d/ in the £in 1930.
And the C.W.S. is not a chain of
the variety known in" Maoriland, which
menaces the existence of concerns such
as the one for . Which I have worked for
10 years—a multiple store which treats
its employees fairly, gives value to cus-
tomers and for many .years has let every
other trader in the same line have every
chance of competing with it.
A buyer from a chain went to a city
warehouse and.said “We,want 200 dozen
men’s half-hose to stunt for Friday and
must have them.to sell at sixpence a pair.
What can you do?” The department
manager’s lowest-price sock was ss. 6d.
a dozen. There. was much to-do about!
it, and finally he passed on his socks to
the chain at 4s. a dozen ; his boss said
“Well, perhaps we-might get even some
other time.” Such chains sell standard
goods no cheaper than other traders, but
by such methods they prosper.— Tip

The Wheat Bounty
The Commonwealth promised it nearly
a year ago, but as I write many N.S.W.
coaxers of grain are still awaiting their
share. “Mulga wires” had it that the cause
of the delay was that the Canberra Gov-
ernment was short of cash. But Senator
Cox was informed at the end of July
that £911,094 had been granted for dis-
tribution in N. S. Wales, £500,000 had
been paid to the State Government and
the balance was available when required.
Also that, of the £500,000 paid, £374,000
had been distributed and payment of the
difference was a matter for the State
Government.
Replying to questions asked in the
Leg'. Assembly, Minister Main blamed
the farmers for not supplying in-
formation. No doubt this has occurred
too often ; still farmers who have sup-
plied information still lack the money.
If a final payment cannot be arranged
for a second interim payment should
be made at once. — Wyalong (N.S.W.).
“WHAT'S YOUR NEXT PIECE
OF ADVICE, MARIA? ”
Is It Superfluous?
Why shouldn’t N. S. Wales have a
Ministry of Local Government? Muni-
cipal and shire councils are charged with
the administration of the whole or part
of various Acts. The State Parliament
created them, gave them powers and re-
sponsibilities, and, if abolition is desired
by the people, it can abolish them. It is
necessary to have a central authority to
settle disputes between councils, thus sav-
ing expensive litigation ; to ensure that
local authorities carry out the powers
entrusted to them; to assist and advise
them when they are in difficulties ; and
to provide central machinery for carry-
ing out parts of Acts which affect them
and which they cannot undertake them-
selves. The Ministry of Local Govern-
ment fills the bill and gives the local
authorities direct representation on the
national authority. So I am for Spooner
and against “Njookenboroo” (B. 1 /8 / ’34).
—Joseph James (N.S.W.).
“Dicey and the New Guard”
Col. Eric Campbell (B. 8 / 8 / ’34) has only
reiterated statements made previously.
The presence of a group of organised
men determined to act effectively if the
principle of free speech was to be denied
was entirely justified by results. Perfect
orderliness always prevailed at New
Guard meetings, lnterjectors were never
molested, but basher gangs were never
game to break up our meetings, although
speakers “protected” by the police some-
times failed to make themselves heard.
Our objection is not to single inter-
jectors but to gangs of political hood-
lums, who, if they attend in sufficient
force, can break up meetings— an action
that the police must lawfully support. If
the rowdy element in large numbers is
determined to prevent speakers being
heard, the police must in the interests of
public peace demand the disbandment of
the meeting—an undeniable negation of
freedom of speech and support of mob-
ocracy. Turn again to Dicey (eighth
edition, page 273):
Where a public meeting, though the
object of the meeting and the conduct of
the members thereof are strictly lawful,
provokes a breach of the peace, and it is
Impossible to preserve or restore the peace
by any other means than by dispersing the
meeting, then magistrates, constables and
other persons in authority may call upon
the meeting to disperse, and if the ineet-
- ing does not disperse it becomes an un-
lawful assembly.
Justification for this action, of course,
depends on the necessity of the case.
Dicey quotes examples. While freedom
of speech is not legally recognised, the
principle has been established by long
usage, and the New Guard is determined
to maintain this freedom for its own
members and other decent elements of
society, as it respected that of its oppo-
nents. Because the New Guard was de-
termined to defend its own meetings, its
opponents never once dared to interfere
with them. In fact, hundreds of New
Guardsmen voluntarily protected the late
Percy Coleman’s meetings, and those
meetings .were never broken up, -even
though in the stronghold of the successor
of Wilkes. A continuation of this policy
will have a wholesome moral effect on
the dregs of society, who are given the
rights of citizenship without being re-
quired to accept its responsibilities.
There is a mistaken impression in some
quarters that the New Guard was belli-
gerently pugnacious. If this was correct
neither Garden nor Lang would ever
have been allowed to address a public
meeting. We always were and are law-
abiding, and the member who was
unanimously expelled for advocating the
forcible seizing of trains to carry the
Cobar firefighters will bear this out. —-
J. Blumenthal; original member and
member of the executive.
Case of the Digger’s Wife
In reply to “Pensioner” (B. l/8/’34),
there is a moral i obligation to pay
pensions to wives of Diggers, in-
cluding those who married after their
discharge. The Digger’s pension is for
incapacity; it represents in money terms
the extent of his disability, and is actually
a slight compensation for his decreased
earning capacity. Pension plus what he
can earn brings an incapacitated Digger
a living wage—for himself. He increases
his responsibilities by taking a wife, but
he cannot meet those added responsibili-
ties by earning more; war disabilities
prevent him. It rests on the Govern-
ment to help him meet these by giving
the wife a pension.
And why should a wife who married
her Digger after 1931 be regarded in any
different light from those who married
prior to that date or even during the
war, when, perhaps, marriage was just
a thrilling adventure? An incapacitated
Digger is now getting on in years and
needs an increasing degree of attention.
A woman who married him since 1931
did so —more credit to her!—knowing
that she would not receive a pension, but
that does not mean she should not get
one.
Take my own case. lam married, and
my wife does not receive a pension.
Classed as seven-eighths incapacitated, it
is only within the last year that I con-
sidered myself in a position to marry. By
postponing that event I saved the Com-
monwealth hundreds of pounds while I
was trying to earn enough to keep a wife.
What a fool I was! My wife could have
been pouching her pension all that time,
and would still be lining up for her cut
every other Thursday. Let me add that
I have always had the greatest courtsey
and consideration from Repat.—Jes-
mond (Vic.).
I am the wife of a returned. soldier,
and a pensioner. My husband, at 18,
took part in The Landing, and was badly
wounded at Pozieres. I married him after
the war, and have three children. He is
a wreck, mental and physical; not yet
40, he looks nearer 60. He is incapable
of continuous concentration on any kind
of work. Every now and again the
children and I are awakened by his
shouts as he leads a bayonet charge, in
dreams, or dodges a gas attack. He is
an M.C.
Since marriage I have had to earn
money, rear three children and act as
nurse to a broken man. I am not com-
plaining, as I am proud to have such a
father for my children. My husband
sacrificed his health and strength for his
country. He has nothing to look for-
ward to now but an early death.
I do not think “Pensioner” is at all
justified in questioning the Government’s
moral right to assist me a little. —
Digger’s Wife (Vic.).
By all means the Commonwealth
should assist a Digger and pension his
wife and family when his inability to do
more for them is due to his having been
incapacitated in his service for it. Em-
ployees contribute to superannuation
funds in cash. Soldiers made the greatest
contribution possible—their lives and
health. — Forty Too (S.A.).


ABORIGINALITIES
Felis”: In reply to my offer to eat
alive any genuine member of the cat
tribe classed by competent authority as
indigenous to Australia and not merely
a domestic cat gone wild, “C.L.8.” steps
in with an offer of a hearty meal (B.
15/8/’34). He has a “wild cat” about
501 b. in weight ready for consumption.
Unhappily he queers his pitch by saying
it is a marsupial—which means it is not
a cat, but one of the dasyures, creatures
only found in Australia and not even
remotely related to the true cats. “C.L.8.”
will have to eat it himself.

“Bumpk”: In a recent hare drive
A. P. Bingley, owner of the Warrendeen
estate, near Geelong, brought down four
of the animals with one barrel and got
four more with two.
* =i= * *
“Cave”: The faithfulness of a devoted
hound can sometimes be overdone. Every
one knows the yarn about the man who
went in swimming and left his dawg to
guard his clothes, with unpleasant re-
sults when he came along in the buff to
regain them. The trait broke out in a
new place at Liverpool (N.S.W.) recently
“Can’t one o’ you blokes lend us a hand to finish the yarn?”
A farmer left his cart containing parcels,
etc., outside the saleyards. When he
came back he found in possession a
strange and savage tyke, who resisted all
his attempts to approach. Two hours
passed ; then, near closing time, a man
came out of the yards and the dog ran
to join him. Investigation showed that
the newcomer had a horse and cart very
like that of the first man, and the bow-
wow had evidently persuaded himself
that he was guarding his master's pro-
perty.
* * * *
“Sknow”: Snake-cracking champeens?
“Greasy Bob” was one, and was always
talking about it. He impressed Billy, and
Bob showed Billy how. One night we
camped by a walerhole where frogs—
and fat snakes—were plentiful. A five-
loot crawler slouched across a patch
illuminated by the cook’s carbide lamp.
At Bob's prompting Billy sneaked up
quietly and quickly behind Joe Blake,
and, seizing the tail firmly, gave a terrific
swing around his head. “Smack!” went
the snake. “Hell!” shouted the cook
as three dead and very shapeless frogs
shot across the camp into the damper he
was mixing.

“Olla Podrida”: Sea monsters? At a
fish-cleaning shed near Hobart, the men
had finished work and were enjoying
tea and cakes. Through the half-open
door a large seal wobbled in, and, rais-
ing itself on its tail, began to help itself
to fish. The men fled through the back
door, but, regaining courage, returned
and attacked the intruder with axes and
piping. The flipper caused a lot of
damage before it was killed. It was
10ft. 6in. long and weighed half a ton.

“Dai R.”: A childhood memory is of
my father lending his kangarooing-knife
to a couple of back-o’-Bourke gins en-
gaged in undressing an emu with the aid
of mussel shells. Each of the ladies tried
the blade, to renounce it in disgust in
favor of the shells, their trouble being
that they couldn’t help burying the point
in the flesh or poking it through the skin.
Early-day squatters used to curse abo.
skinners for the way they mutilated the
carcasses or ribboned the hides; and
roo-hunters in districts where bags were
heavy would work early and late rather
than have abo. help for the same reason.
On the other hand, half- and quarter-
castes (especially the latter) could use the
skinning-knife more skilfully than most
whites.

Kumusi Crossing”: Likely enough
that New Guinea harbors two distinct
varieties of crocodiles—-if fine distinc-
tions were observed the division might
resolve itself into half a dozen (B. 8/8/’34).
In my experience at the Papuan end of
the island the brutes were invariably
porosus, so common in river estuaries
and middle waters the world over, save in
South America. But, in addition to this
notorious ruffian, North Queensland can
produce—far up in fresh water only—•
the fish-eating gavial, with its slender
body and long, narrow snout, which
Australian naturalists refer to as C. john-
stoni. This chap, or a near-relative, is
found also in Indian and Malayan rivers
and also in West Africa. All known
species of crocodile or alligator, in
common with most of the world’s fauna,
save the snakes and some of their bird
relatives, have only the lower jaw mov-
able. The writer of the par. says that
one of his discoveries has the upper jaw
movable, and, therefore, detached from
the skull! My advice is to rush his speci-

“Der Jong’: Those Bombala parrots
which fly about with a mob of sparrows,
eat the same food and generally imitate
the habits of the spags (B. 8/ 8 / ’34) recall
a pet aasvogel I once owned in the Lyden-
burg Ranges in the Northern Transvaal.
He caught himself by landing in my little
netted fowlyard to investigate the carcass
of a buck I had hung up so that the
fowls might feed on the maggots. His
great wing-spread prevented his getting
out again, and for some reason his life
was spared, vultures not being popular,
as a rule, outside zoos. The fowls, and
especially the chickens, took to him
greatly, and he made no attempt to inter-
fere with them. Indeed, he was not long
in acquiring the fowlyard habits. One
morning I caught him vigorously scratch-
ing the ground and emitting, instead of
the croak usually associated with vultures,
a sound very closely resembling “cluck,
cluck.” He was at once besieged by
the other inhabitants of the yard, who
searched his feathers thoroughly as he
squatted on the ground for the multitu-
dinous biteys that his kind are always
equipped with.
* * * *
“Cam Cove”: I’ll let “J.M.S.” (B.
1 /8/’34) have his own way about jack-
asses being mimics ; I’m more interested
in Jack’s peace of mind. Does he laugh
in any country outside Australia? I’ve
been told that when exiled he gives up
giggling altogether. Old bush hands
in Maoriland say the transplanted Jacks
have never been heard to laugh, even
though they have the same freedom of
the trees as they enjoy in Aussie.
* * * *
“Starvelonga”: The echidna yarn is
not in the fiction class (B. 25/7/’34). Its
ant diet doesn’t affect the echidna’s
steaks, and I ought to know—l have
eaten dozens. Roasted in a camp-oven,
the meat is delicious. Kangaroo (and
wallaby) flesh is quite palatable, but
rather dry. If “Blueskin” found it rankly
flavored, that could only have been be-
cause the meat was not hung for a few
days before cooking. Having eaten (of
necessity) of virtually everything in the
bush save dingo, cat, fox, goanna and
snake, I consider the early-Australian
menu was not so bad.
* * * *
“Rich. J.”: I burnt off a patch of scrub,
and was walking through it next day ;
the logs were still smouldering when I
came across a young and vigorous
possum. Two yards away in the hollow
of a burnt-out stump was the charred
body of its mother. She must have
protected it in her pouch during the
fury of the fire at the cost of
her own life. But fire had no terrors
for the survivor. For months after his
rescue his home was in a warm spot
right under my stove; then the bush
called, and he left —after clawing my
sleeping face to show what he really
thought of me.

“Gam : Most people dislike snakes,
but a man at Mt. Gambier (S.A.) be-
lieves in taking more than usual pre-
cautions. He drove about ten miles to
the scrub for a load of wood, and sur-
prised his family by returning home in
his overcoat, minus his pants. While he
was swinging the axe a wriggler tried to
bite him, but the fangs couldn’t penetrate
the leg of his trousers. He was not run-
ning any risk, however: his strides are
still in the bush.

“M.M.” (Norfolk Island): Re “Bucko’s”
par. (B. 18/7/’34) about the old lady who
released rabbits on Phillip Island, four
miles from Norfolk. Any old lady who
could smuggle white mice, - let alone
rabbits, past the NT. customs officer
would be a wily old damet indeed.
Actually the rabbits date from convict
days, when they were introduced to pro-
vide sport for the officers. Phillip Island,
four miles of rarely-calm water away
from Norfolk, was then covered with
grass and pines. The rabbits now live on
one another. We are all heartily sick of
that old lady.

“Spinifex”: Have seen sea-birds
further inland than 200 miles from the
ocean (B. 8/ 8 /’34). From time to time
there have been small flocks of seagulls
on Rifle Creek dam, in the Mount Isa
district (Q.), over 300 miles south of the
Gulf and more than 600 miles west of
Townsville. The birds seemed quite at
home on the freshwater lake banked up
between spinifex ridges.

“Larrapinta”: At Koppio, out from

battle between a cat and a 3ft. brown
snake. When Tom, a fine-looking puss

who followed his owner about like a
dog, saw. the snake he crouched flat and
stalked it, then made a quick spring
and smacked it with the flat of his paw
on the head as he passed. Giving it no
time to recover, he darted back and
struck again. The wriggler began to
look very sick; the cat feinted with a
paw, and as the snake struck Tom pinned
him down with both paws on the neck
and crunched the head to pulp with his
teeth. Then he sat off for a time, watch-
ing the snake twist and writhe. Again
he pinned it down, and, stripping the skin
back from the neck for six inches, began
to eat it. Soon only the crushed head
and some long strips of skin remained.

“Bark”: Saw a couple of loads of

bricks disappear in double-quick time off
a Hobart wharf. A factory worker, sun-
ning after lunch, noticed a big fish near
the wharf, apparently disabled and trying
to gain an even keel. He heaved a brick
from a heap just deposited, and his many
cobbers joined in the bombardment.
When the whistle blew all hands
skedaddled; all the bricks had ske-
daddled, too. Five minutes later a
cba p off a ferry-boat was vilifying the
ancestors of the blighter who had told
him the bricks would be delivered in
time for next trip. The fish was still

“Cudgerie”: I paid a visit to the
home of my neighbor Giuseppe, a
sugar-farmer near Tully (Q.).
“Giuseppe, he not here,” his wife
informed me. “He take gun away.
He shoot ha-ha peegeon. Soon
he come back. You wait.” Shortly
afterwards Giuseppe arrived, and
tied to his belt were four kooka-
burras. Mrs. Giuseppe plucked
and cleaned these “ha-ha
peegeons” and converted
them into stew that smelt
strongly of garlic. 1 was in-
vited to stay for tea, but hap-
pened to remember an ap-
pointment. Before I left,
however, I impressed upon
Giuseppe that kookaburras
were protected, and that he and his
missus should try caw-caw pigeons next
time.

nearly cut through the finger and an in-
cision that took the top off it —and all
over a nip from an eight-inch brown
snake! A real bushman would treat the
bite of such an infant in the same way
as a “Deadwood Dick” hero of my kid-
hood treated bullets of less than .302
calibre. Riddled with .22 slugs from
a tenderfoot’s revolver, he refused to
treat the incident as sufficiently serious
for drawing on his would-be antagonist,
and dismissed his wounds as “durned
bee-stings.” Snakes of the brown and
black types are harmless until they reach
the length of 12 inches.

“Sirius”: The sting of the gympie-tree
(B. 18/7/”34) is due, not, as many think,
to a secretion of acetic and formic acids,
but to the fine siliceous spines with which
the leaves are covered. These spines
break off in the skin ; they are insoluble,
which accounts for the persistence of the
sting for a period of several weeks.

“Kariah”: A dog’s bark (B. 25/7/’34)
is hereditary, no doubt, but I know of
a 12-year-old mong which has spent the
last eight years in the company of
turkeys, and now his querulous, old-man
bark is a good imitation of a turkey’s
gobble.

“Pee Dee”: Just as well “Cam Cove’s”
■penguin (B. 1/8/’34) was dead; These
little chaps are quick and accu-
rate with their beaks. On Pen-
guin Island (W.A.) we would
carry birds from their nests to
the water to watch their aqua-
tic prowess. One lad, unmind-
ful of warnings, picked one up
in his arms and caressed the
sheeny down of its head with
his face. Like a flash the appar-
ently dazed bird (they sleep in
the daytime) snapped its beak
with a whip-like crack, and the
lad was neatly earmarked with
a deep triangular cut. Before
he could drop it his lip was
gashed with a second grab. The
earmark is still there. I see it
every morning as I carefully
manipulate a razor over the raised scar
on my upper lip.

“Swag Hound”: An Englishman, E.
Suscatt, has had to put us right about
Binghi’s maturity ceremony:
On a male arriving at the age of man-
hood he is hung by the heels, and the
chief, or some other person appointed by
the tribe, bites from him one of his front
teeth. The meaning of this mystery is not
known.
According to a barman at Bathurst, who
ought to know, Mr. Suscatt is a relative
of the English pundit who settled the
argument about the waratah. He declared
that it could not fly.
H*
“Humo”: Colorful New Guinea flora
are found among several varieties of
ficus that make a distorted growth. The
flowers of one are bright yellow, and are
developed on the stem as well as in the
axils of the leaves. The fruit is not un-
like a pear in appearance. Flowers of
another are pale blue and form only on
the larger branches; the fruit, in size
and shape, and by the clusters that hang
from the limbs, resembles the cherry.
Natives say both fruits are poisonous,
but hornbills and the crested blue
pigeons think otherwise. Another exotic
specimen grows to a huge height, and has
the curious habit of changing the color
of its leaves preceding its flowering
season ; there is a complete loss of chloro-
phyll in the leaves, and they turn a dirty
greyish-white. A week later they are
suffused with erythrophyll and become
blood-red. They stay like this for several
weeks, then again turn green, and the tree
bursts into a multitude of pink bell-
shaped flowers at the ends of the small
branches. Yet another curiosity attains
a height of 30ft. and develops enormous
yellow buds in the axils of the branches ;
when these break they release pulpy,
pink-tinged leaves which, after a short
exposure, turn pure white and hang
down in lOft.-long festoons. From a dis-
tance they give the tree the appearance
of being covered in snow.

“Solomon’s Mate”: Those historians
who have been chronicling the destruc-
tion of the plain turkey through a
diet of horny-legged grasshoppers (B.
8/8/’34) will have to think up a new one.
The hardy yeomen of Weddin Mountain
in N.S.W. have been wondering why their
fowls were turning up their toes with
unmistakable symptoms of a pain in the
pinny. One lad tried a post-mortem, and
found his chooks were full of green-head
ants which had invaded the fowlyards in
quantities after the recent heavy rain.
The ants were alive in the crops and
clockwork of many of the dead chooks,
and had evidently bitten them to death.
Anyone who has taken his best girl to
sit on the grass beneath the soft, roman-
tic moon in the vicinity of a green-head
nest will appreciate the painful end of
the N.S.W. fowls at the nippers of the
poisonous little beasts.

“Clef”: On the Darling Downs in
the late ’sixties the popular bush song
was “My Old Bullock Dray,” and one
verse ended “From the little pademelon
to the big kangaroo.” It was on every
station-hand’s lips, and had as many
verses as the “Wile Kerlonial Boy.” I
can remember men bringing the pretty
little fellows (B. 15/8/’34) in for us
youngsters to play with, but was too
young to remember the pademelons’
shape or color. It’s 30 years since I heard
the old song.
“S. Q. Whyffe”: “Erne” (B. 25/7/’34)
asks who has seen an Australian eagle
take another bird in the air. Have seen
one chase a flying bunch of black ducks ;
though gaining rapidly, the paddlers beat
it to a handy lagoon and dived straight
under. Saw an eagle drop a rabbit from
about 200 feet and catch it again in
mid-air with a jerk that finished bunny’s
struggles for good. An osprey caught
and lifted a fish, then dropped it to the
order of a silver sea-eagle, which grabbed
the catch, only to be chased by a wedge-
tail. A woody point hid the finish.
COW-CUMBERED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the morning, about four,
When you reckon that you’ve more
Than an hour or two still left to doze and
drowse,
Someone bellows out, “I say,
Do you mean to sleep all day?
Here’s young Johnnie coming, bringing in
the cows!”
Then it’s pull, pull, pull!
Till the pail is flowing full,
And you empty it to fill it up again.
And the bucket seems to drag
As your weary shinbones sag.
And your back seems nearly breaking with
the strain.
Then the busy, sloppy day
Nearly works itself away,
For dairying but little rest allows,
And you’re hoping for a spell
When you hear that awful yell:
“Here’s young Johnnie coming, bringing in
the cows!”
Then it’s squirt, squirt, squirt!
Till your fingers fairly hurt,
But you haven’t time to stop or mind the
pain;
For, unless you travel fast,
You’ll finish with the last
And ’twill soon be time to start the cows
again!

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
CRUTCHING AND JETTING.
“Agamemnon”: The C.S.I.R. method
oi fly control combines Clutching and
arsenical jetting. Trapping is too expen-
sive. Intensive tests only reduced strikes
by Jour per cent. Carcass destruction,
although imperative for other reasons, is
useless, since the smallest game carcass
can act as a host. At any rate, carcasses
should be burned ; burying assists the
maggot.
Ihe Queensland Government’s 1926
tests suggested that jetting with sodium
arsenite gave live months’ immunity
from strikes. My experience does not
support this, but it should give four to
five weeks’ freedom, and, in conjunction
with timely crutcbing, should obviate
loss. Jetting or crutching alone is little
use, although jetting reduces fatal strikes.
In a mob of 150, crutched and jetted,
only eight developed serious strikes in
lour months as against 56 among sheep
crutched only.
Calcium arsenite is better than sodium
compounds, the cost being one-fifth penny
in place of one penny per head for dips.
Care should be taken to have the jet held
parallel to the wool fibres to ensure total
penetration, and the pressure should be
legulated according to wool growth.
Pressures may range from 1001 b. for
month-old wool to 1301 b.
WHEN TO DRENCH LAMBS.
“Cloncurry”: Most graziers in worm
country drench at weaning or at the ewe
shearing. Mostly this is too late. Lambs
early become subject to worms. Drop-
pings and condition tell the story.
When the age of the lambs averages
from six to eight weeks, yard and drench
the breeders, being careful first to give
the mob a full day’s starving at least,
and to try the mixture previously on
half a dozen lambs.
Be careful that the correct dosage is
given to both grown sheep and lambs
(half the full dose for the latter), and
ten days later let the mob have a second
issue to deal with the new crop of para-
sites hatched from the eggs that the first
drench failed to destroy. A reliable
mixture in the right doses will not harm
either ewes or lambs, though they may
be free from parasites.
FLYTRAPS.
Catchpenny”: Flytraps, provided you
can keep them cleared (B. 8/8/’34), are
all they are said to be. However, care-
ful as you may be, maggots are apt to
drop from the top of the traps. Once
on the ground they find shelter and
grow.
I find it pays to stand the traps,
whether of glass or tin, in shallow, flat
tins—square baking dishes or those pro-
vided for standing coolers or drip safes
on are splendid. Keep the tins half-full
of water with a little poison—an arseni-
cal mixture is good.
This kills any maggots which fall oft'
the trap. Over the flat tin secure a good-
fitting fine wire-netting, above the level
of the water, and so secured to the frame
of the tin that it cannot be bent down, to
pi event birds or stock from taking a sip.
You’ll be surprised at the extra infant
mortality this method causes.
THE SCOURING OF WOOL.
“Jumbuck”: “Dead Finish” (B.
25/7/’34) forgot to mention the chief
I actor that precludes many graziers from
having their lower sorts of wool scoured
locally—lack of competition at sales. Yet
many owners, when wool prices sag, will
send to central markets locks and stained
pieces in the grease that hardly return
the amount paid away in freights. There
are too many graziers who won't get
away from the orthodox.
If dusty, heavy-conditioned or low-
grade wool is divided, half being sent to
scour, the other half to market in the
grease, and separate accounts arc kept,
ultimate results will prove which method
of disposal helped the more to reduce
the overdraft. L saw the test applied six
years ago, and the owner of a little 200-
bale clip now has the whole of his wool
scoured.
HINTS ON COUNTING SHEEP.
“Dead Finish”: To acquire accuracy
in sheep-counting practice and concen-
tration are needed. Many stockmen will
dodge the job because they have never
had enough practice.
For small mobs, counting by two is
certain, but if the man at the gate is
good at addition lots of two, three and
four can be taken as the sheep bulk
themselves together coming out. Should
he have any misgivings about himself,
play for safety, and take them in pairs
—don’t take anything singly. For big
lots this method becomes tiring, and one
is apt to slip the count. The system of
bulking the jumbucks into groups of
three, counting up to 33 and calling the
hundred for the odd, calls for prac-
tice and concentration and a quick eye.
The sheepman skilled in this method will
cover big mobs with less fatigue than
any other style.
The next thing is to find out the
natural side to take the count, i.e., the
near- or the off-side, and whether the
counter feels confident with sheep com-
ing at him or going away. This is im-
portant. Many good counters are at sea
on the wrong side.
For mobs coming through a fairly
wide opening, it is advisable to stand a
few feet back, but, if the get-out is
narrow, standing at the gate is best.
Always pick out the head as the part of
the sheep to be registered in the mind.
Watch out for the odd one that breaks
back, as well as the one that comes out
backwards. Lambs have a bad habit of
tumbling through the gate. The opening
should be lessened for these. The occa-
sional one that breaks behind the
counter should be tallied in absentia—
never shift the gaze from those coming
forward.
The counter only calls the hundred
each time as he arrives at it. The “tally”-
keeper should call 500 or 600, as the
case may be, and have some check on
himself. This is usually done by jotting
the hundred down in a notebook or
cutting a notch in a stick. Many drovers
transfer pebbles from one hand to the
other until the thousand is reached, and
then reverse the procedure until the next
thousand arrives.
The width of the opening through
which the mob is to be tallied is alb
important. Beware of the Ananias who
boasts of taking them “hurdle wide."
Never pay out on his total. For full-
woolled sheep, a wider opening is neces-
sary than that for late shorn." For the
merinos, up to three feet is enough for
flock ewes, well-grown wethers requiring
more.
EXIT THE MARKING KNIFE.
“Sheepo”: A trial with an emasculator
recently placed on the market has caused
me to cast aside the knife for all time.
I he job can be done just as quickly with
the emasculator as with the knife, but
what impressed more than anything else
was that the lambs marked by the new
process mothered up better than did
those marked with the knife. Wounds
from the knife cause a lot of lambs to
lag, and many eventually die through not
finding their dams again.
Lambs for the export trade should
mature earlier when treated with the
emasculator, as they suffer no setback.
A temporary swelling occurs, but the
flow of blood is stopped. The chance
of tetanus, a common source of loss of
lambs, is minimised by the absence of
open wounds.
REARING CALVES.
“Rich. J.”: Here are a few good rules:
Always remember that a young calf is
almost as delicate as a young child.
Treat it quietly and patiently.
When feeding skimmed milk, some
constituent should be added to replace
the food value which has been removed.
All foods, whether pasture, grain or
ensilage, contain flesh-forming and
body-heating materials —protein, carbo-
hydrates and fat; but, as calves have
difficulty in absorbing them in their raw
state, a reliable oil meal will supply the
deficiency.
Skimmed milk, free of froth, should
be fed at body heat, for cold milk needs
animal energy to make it digestible.
Most farmers forget that body-warm-
ing foods are no use if shelter from
cold winds is not provided. Any old
shed is suitable in extreme conditions of
cold.
I have used an old shed without sides,
bagging up the side from which wind
and rain were most prevalent.
Another good tip is to keep feeding-
buckets clean and the calf paddock
free from paper, rubbish and manure.
Rubbish breeds flies and carries disease.
If a good lick of salt and bonemeal is
provided and the above rules observed,
calves can be kept in great heart and
condition.
BALANITIS.
“Valerin”: Balanitis in western and
central pastoral N.S.W. is a serious ail-
ment in wethers.
How the disease originates is not
known. Bad shearing which leaves too
much wool around the affected parts to
retain the urine, grass-seed and clipping
away the long, straight protective hairs
are generally blamed.
In its earlier stages dressings of copper
sulphate and lysol solutions may cure,
but when advanced surgical treatment is
the only remedy. The operation calls
for care and cleanliness, and the only
instruments needed are a grooved probe
about six inches long and a small curved
knife. Place the sheep on its back and
run the probe as far as it will go through
the sheath. Then slit the sheath from top
to bottom, following the groove of the
probe, remove the pus by squeezing and
clean thoroughly with cotton-wool. Dress
with some mild disinfectant such as a
two per cent, solution of lysol or car-
bolic oil. It is advisable to watch the
sheep till the wound is healed.
“IT PAYS TO FERTILISE.”
“El V.”: Australia does all too little
in pasture improvement. Even some of
the best land in the Sydney environs
which once carried heavy agriculture is
regarded as poor and useless simply be-
cause its owners did not fertilise and
introduce appropriate pastures. A farm
once owned by Governor King in the
Camden district illustrates the situation.
Half of it is poor and hard, sparsely
covered with native grasses and the
hardier pests on which scarcely a beast
in five acres could live. The other, hoed,
well dressed with super, and planted with
sub. clover, is a luxurious pasture, im-
proving itself yearly with its own humus
and conserved moisture.
Mr. Fairbairn, Federal member for
Flinders, had something to say on the
subject in the House of Reps, during
the debate on the Financial Relief Bill.
He approved the fertiliser bounty, which
is now to be renewed after a year’s
lapse, as the first assistance which the
wool industry received from either State
or Federal Governments. To show the
value of fertilisers, he instanced his own
experience on 4000 acres in Victoria
which nine years ago carried 3000 sheep
indifferently in a good season. Thanks
to superphosphate, the property this year
will shear 10,000 sheep and turn off 220
bales of wool against 54 bales nine years
ago. In its original condition, the farm
carried no cattle. Now it supports 350,
a’nd the labor employed has increased by
400 p.c.
This experience is not isolated. Since
the Prell experiments in particular a
decade ago, hundreds of Australian
farmers have learnt the force of the
slogan “It pays to fertilise.”
BURNING OFF.
“F. 34”: Any clear sunny winter’s day
seems to be the signal for burning off old
grass in Central Queensland. The pro-
cess has several advantages, destroying
embryo ticks and stomach-worms, sweet-
ening the soil and causing the grass to
shoot earlier.
But winter isn’t the time to do the job.
We can still expect a few frosty nigh's
when a warm bed of long grass is much
sought after by stock.
Again, where wallabies are numerous
a fairly clean burn helps them consider-
ably to keep the grass too short for
cattle »to graze, while long grass cramps
their style. In C.Q., too, it is unusual to
get spring rains before the latter part of
September, when the thunderstorms start.
When the storms fail to arrive even old
grass is better than none. Roughly speak-
ing, the blacker the smoke from the fire,
the greater the loss of nitrogen, which
should be returned to the soil. The diT
ference in soil evaporation caused by the
hot spring winds blowing across a burnt,
bare paddock and one with a fair body
of old grass to protect it is more than
enough to offset the gains of burning-off.
The right time to burn off in C.Q. is on
the hot, fine days following a good spring
storm.
A USEFUL CHAFF ELEVATOR.
“A.G.T.”: For the sides of a 14ft.
elevator procure two 14ft. by 9in. by Jin.
hardwood boards. Square the ends, place
one on top of the other on the flat, and
centrally, 7in. from each end, bore a
hole through both.
Stand the boards on their edge, side by
side, and 3in. from the upper edge

do), is mounted at each end centrally
between the side boards on a fin. shaft
thrust through the Jin. holes. Iron bear-
ings are fitted outside. One shaft pro-
jects 12in. from the elevator side fitted
with a 6in. dia. by 3in. face pulley for
driving.
The conveyor belt is made from a
length of 3in. belting, with cleats spaced
18in. apart across it. The cleats, Sin.
long by 2in. wide, are cut from a kero-
sene-case end, and attached with screws.
The belt ends are joined by a buckle to
permit tightening.
The elevator is fitted to the chaffcutter
with the usual sheet-iron hopper under
the knife wheel. It is driven by a 7in.
pulley on the cutter spindle with a 3in.
buckled belt.
This elevator handles the chaff from
a 9f in.-mouth cutter without any chok-
ing.
FODDER CONSERVATION.
“X.T.”: The Queensland Bureau of
Industry has taken up the matter of
fodder conservation. It divides the pro-
blem into two sections —one for graziers
against dry years; the other for farmers
against dry months.
Last year, the Government approved a
scheme put forward by the bureau for the
experimental storage of £60,000 worth of
lucerne, hay, maize and other standbys
in suitable centres.
The State was to find half the cost and
the graziers and financial interests the
rest. Interest was to be written off to
insurance. The graziers did not take the
same view as the sponsors of the scheme,
so it lapsed.
For farm conservation, the bureau esti-
mates that ensilage “would not pay as
general part of the farm routine, except
with specially efficient farming and high-
quality stock.”
When all costs (actual outgo or not) are
included, the total costs in terms of butter-
fat are estimated to be close to Is. per
pound.
Tn favorable circumstances, however, the
actual money outlay would be much less.
The average receipts by farmers for the
butter content of their cream for the 12
months ended June, 1934, were only Bfd.
per pound.
However, not only production but stock
maintenance has to be considered in time
of drought. And in any case, though
butter-fat at present prices does not pay
in a good season, farmers go on
producing.
GRASS HARROWING.
“Sandy”: It is now time for a final
spreading of the droppings before the
spring. Here are two simple spreaders.
(a) A clodcrusher having spikes two
inches long, placed every running three
inches in the drawbar. These root out
any manure lying in hollows. A heavy
drag chain tied across the back spreads
the broken manure. ( b ) Old cultivation
harrows with wire-netting fixed under
each frame so as to force the manure
down and pulverise it.
A satisfactory job can only be done
after a soaking rain or on fresh drop-
pings as in rotational grazing. Victorian
Agricultural Department tests show that
the benefit comes from the manure and
not from the severe tearing of the sward.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“A.G.T.”: Old winnower bag-rings are
handy for rebagging grain. Bolt to a
post in the grain shed and support the
end with a chain and hook. This allows
it to fall out of the way when not in use.
“T.T.”: Another tip for wool-bale
brands. Have a plain style of figures for
the numbering so that 3,9, 6 and 8 are
easily distinguished.
“Timothy Tywire”: Serviceable step-
mats for the running-board of your car
when the original covering wears through
can be made from old tyres. Cut from
the tread and affix to the running
board with screws or small bolts.
“Karaway”: Old horseshoes with' the
points straightened and drawn out do
as well as mortise-holes for sliprails when
driven into the sides of round posts.
They are handy for making an opening
in an old fence, either rail or wire.
“Whalebone”: An overhaul of rabbit-
traps before stacking them for the
summer may save a caught finger or a
lost trap when they are used next winter,
and will result in a better average catch.
Straighten out all bent pegs and substi-
tute new ones for any' cracked at the
eye. Also, tighten loose plates and jaws
and see that the traps do not go off
either too slowly or too quickly. Always
store the traps in a shed in preference
to leaving them in the bush. Rust slows
them up.
“Teg”: Don’t buy expensive fumi-
gators if you own an old car. Fix a hose-
pipe from exhaust pipe to burrow and
let carbon monoxide do the rest. A
Riverina pastoral co. finds that one four-
gallon tin of benzine will treat 30 large
warrens.
“R.J.”: Don’t throw away motor
crankcase drainings. Placed on stagnant
pools the oil will keep down mosquitoes.
Painted on wooden fencepo&s and barns
it protects against white ants. It is use-
ful for oiling sulky and farm-cart springs,
and sprayed inside fowlhouses, pig-pens
and cowbails, it is an effective preventive
against vermin of alt kinds.
“Pick”: A refuge for western starving
herds, Monaro (N.S.W.) collects every
kind of noxious weed. This winter’s new-
comer is an effectual herbage destroyer,
locally called “red grass.” It has spread
apace over the fertile flats of Gundaroo
and Bowylie. In malted clumps, it chokes
out extensive patches of the natural grass,
and leaves the surface road bare when
it withers. Stock will not touch it. The
best method of dealing with the pest so
far invented is to hoe it out and plant
the cleared areas with clover or quick-
growing artificial grasses.
“Doitnow”: Prevent and cure footrot
as follows: Around each salt trough
spread a large circle of lime and lay an
inner circle of bluestone. Work the blue-
stone only lightly into the ground about
lin. deep. The sheep walk on to the
lime and get their feet dried, and then
on to the bluestone patch, where they are
being treated all the time they are lick-
ing the salt. This method has proved
most effective in England, and is cheap.
Periodically the lime needs renewing, and
occasionally the bluestone —according to
use and weather.
“Lynden”: Next time you are tying
barbed-wire on a dropper fence try this
to prevent the barb from slipping off the
top of the posts, as often happens if
the holes are bored a bit close to the
edge of the post. Bore the plain wire
holes close to the edge of the post and
the hole for the barb about an inch
further in from the edge. Then tie the
battens on with the plain wire on one
side of the battens and the barbed-wire
on the other. Thus, the battens will be
on the same side of the wire as the
post. With the barb on the other side it
cannot possibly get out of place.
“Pineneedle”: “Orchard Hand’s”
method (B. 25/7/’34) of dealing with shy-
bearing fruit-trees by belting the bark
with the back of the axe is too severe.
The proper way is to cincture by using a
sharp knife right round the trunk. The
best time is when about two-thirds of
the blossoms are open. I have used this
method with great success on shy-bearing
navel oranges. Always paint the wound
with Bordeaux to prevent fungus spores
gaining entry. The bark heals neatly over
in a short time.
“A.G.T.”: To make a hay-carting
frame for the waggon that anyone can
load, place four beams across the body,
one at each end and the others spaced
equally between, all projecting 18in. over
each side. Place a beam lengthwise on
the ends of these cross bearers, one on
each side and a foot or so longer than
the body. Place a back and front rail
on the ends of these side rails. Bore and
twitch tightly together. In each corner
of the outer rails erect a 7ft. upright.
From the top of this run a diagonal rail
down to the middle of the front rail and
a second diagonal down the same dis-
tance to the side rail.

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
XlV— The Wild Colonial School.
There is no doubt that this school
existed sometime or other. All the poets,
most of the writers and not a few of the
artists are agreed on this point. It is
difficult, however, to say just when it
flourished. It was after the Convict Days
but before the Depression. The big gold
rushes were over, but there were still
bushrangers about. Horseracing was
popular, but Tatt.’s and the State lot-
teries hadn’t begun. Say somewhere in
ihe middle earlies.
The typical man of the period was a
hard-living, hard-drinking, hard-swearing,
hard-riding, hard-hitting stockman. He
was so hard that if you struck him sparks
(lew out; though it is doubtful whether
you would live long enough to appre-
ciate the fireworks. Nevertheless, he had
a heart of gold, and would probably be
the first to empty his wallet when some-
one passed the hat around to collect for
your widow and orphans.
He used to spend most of his days
droving huge mobs of enormous cattle
over tremendous distances in incredibly
short time. His horses and dogs were
animals of more than human intellect,
but with little commonsense, as they
could have made their fortunes in the
circus or on the stage.
Some authorities believe that the stock-
man was a descendant of the warder of
the early days —chiefly because of his
skill with the stockwhip and branding
iron. He could thunder up on his horse
and slash his initials on a bullock 30 feet
away. This was his favorite pastime, and
some of the beasts used to look like an
enthusiastic flapper’s autograph book
after Fleet Week.
A variation of this game was to flick
the ash off a colleague's cigarette at the
same range. This was a very popular
indoor sport and caused a lot of amuse-
ment at bush dances. It also explains
why so many stockmen smoked pipes.
When the colonial scholars were not
mustering or droving stock they were
talking about mustering or droving stock,
or singing songs about it, or reciting
verses about it. Sometimes a man would
get tired of mustering and droving stock
and would clear out and go to another
part of the country, where he would get
a job mustering and droving stock.
By modern standards it was a mono-
tonous existence, but the stockmen didn’t
think so. In fact, they all agreed that
they’d “live the same life over if they
had to live again,” provided, of course,
that they could have the same stockwhip.
And surely no one would begrudge them
that?

EARLY TRAINING.
Suddenly he found himself grappling
with temptation. He glanced irresolutely
at the retreating figure of the man —and
then at the wallet which had slipped
from his pocket.
Would he return it or keep it himself?
He bit his lip indecisively. There was
no one about; and, after all, the man
looked fairly Well to do: he probably
wouldn’t miss it.
But his conscience pricked him.
“You’re not going to be a thief, are
you?” it said.
He thought of his grey-haired father,
sitting by the fireside at home. What
would he say if he saw his son vacillat-
ing in a crisis like this? He could almost
hear the old man’s words —steady, un-
varying advice. Yes! That was what
Dad would say! That was the best
thing to do!
Resolutely he picked up the wallet —
and slipped it into his pocket.

HER SALETIME SHOPPING.
When Mabel shops, she goes her way
Upon the very latest day
With that bright optimism which
All true endeavor props,
And revels in the fallacy
That shop folk are as keen as she
To hunt ideal bargains out,
When Mabel shops.
When Mabel shops for self or gift,
Her change of mind is sure and swift,
And her advice, like heaven’s dew,
On just and unjust drops ;
And dll things in her path are. stirred,
And peace is but an idle word,
And tumult and disorder reign
When Mabel shops.
When Mabel shops, she does not waste
One moment, but in feverish haste
Pursues her toil, till closing time
Her ardent labor stops;
And in her wake there is a trail
Of maddened girls, and shopmen pale
With long suppressed profanity.
When Mabel shops.

Cause and cure of warts on the neck ? —2822.
Usual causes are constitutional irregulari-
ties and lime deficiency in the system. Take
two tablespoons of limewater with milk o*
water between meals, and add a pinch
of Epsom salts to the cup of tea at breakfast
and dinner at night. Include green vegetables
and farinaceous foods freely in the diet. Large
warts should be treated with a daily applica-
tion of salicylic acid in collodion.
Cause of and remedy for coarsened growth
of finger- and toenails ? They are very dis-
colored and cracked. —2766.
Apart from debility as an aggravating factor
the fault originates. in continued use of caustic
solutions and bore-water for domestic pur-
poses. Discoloration and splitting of the nail
plate persist until the cause? is removed. In
the absence of fungal infection, an oil treat-
ment with massage should benefit, the nails
meanwhile being filed to shape instead of cut-
ting. Apply a well-oiled rag at night after
soaking the fingers in hot boracic solution,
and dust freely with starch powder after the
morning wash. Wear rubber gloves for house-
hold duties.
How should a student who does a lot of
night work arrange the lighting in order to
avoid eye strain ? —2697.
Light must be adequate for size of room,
and must be constant and uniform over the
work being done. The finer the work the
more light will be needed. Shadows and glare
on work must be avoided where possible—the
opalescent lamp is permissible. Light should
be so placed that it falls directly on the work,
a shade being worn if necessary to protect
the eyes. With these precautions, the 60-watt
■amp (clear glass) should serve for a small to
medium room.
My canaries have been falling off their
pet ches, running round in circles and panting
heavily. Cause and cure 3—2571.
May be due to over-stimulation on account
of the feeding and confined space, as some
cages are too small to give the birds any exer-
cise whatever. Feed the birds on plain canary
seed only for a time, .with plenty of green
lood and a little Epsom salts in the water at
the proportion of a teaspoon to a pint, given
about once a week.
(1) What qualifications are necessary to obtain
a position as mine manager in Q’land ? (2)
Course of study to be undertaken ? (3) Salary ?
(4) Possibilities of employment ? —2671.
(1) Several years of practical mining experi-
ence and good testimonials from employers.
(2) If more than 20 men are employed a mine
manager’s certificate is necessary, which is
granted after an examination held by the Board
of Examiners of the Mines Department, or
may be granted without an examination to the
holder of a School of Mines diploma. (3)
According to size and importance of mine.
Varies from £7 to £8 per week to a consider-
ably higher figure. (4) With the revival of
mining the possibilities of engagement for a
well-qualified man are fairly good.
(1) Before practising as an accountant in
Vic., is it necessary to pass an examination '!
(2) If so, where and when are the examinations
held ? (3) Cost to enter such examinations ? —•
2824.
(1) Not according to law. (2) Institute of
Chartered Accountants in Aust., Charter House,
Bank-place, Melb., C.l, holds examinations in
April and October of each year. (3) About
guineas.
(1) Has suction gas been successfully used
with internal-combustion engines ? (2) Name
of book dealing with suction gas, together with
information concerning driving a car with this
fuel ?— 2805.
(1) Yes, with engines having a high-compres-
sion ratio. Large engines appear to give best
results. (2) Do not know of any book dealing
with suction gas as applied to car engines.
Information on gas engines and suction gas
will be found in “Gas and Oil-engine Opera-
tion,” by J. Okill, ss. 6d.; “Gas and Oil-engine
Management,” by M. P. Bale, ss. 3d.; “Gas
Engines and'Producers,” by Marks, 10s. 6d.;
obtainable from Angus and Robertson.
In the event of a person finding something of
value on the beach of Fraser Island, Queens-
land, to what authority should the find be
reported ? —2777.
If it is a wreck or wreckage, the finder should
report to the Receiver of Wrecks, Common-
wealth Navigation and Lighthouse Service,
Brisbane, or to the nearest Sub-collector of
Customs or police officer. The matter is dealt
with in Sections 296 to 327 of the Common-
wealth Navigation Acts.
How to make a cheap and effective spray to
kill flies and mosquitoes? —2Bl4.
Mix lib. pyrethrum and 1 gal. of kerosene
and shake well, placing in a tightly-corked
bottle overnight, and then straining through
fine muslin, adding 3oz. methyl salicylate. The
preparation should be kept corked and away
from fire. Apply sparingly with a fine atomiser,

water, then dry well before storing.
Can water be siphoned from any depth ?
—2937.
Theoretically, the height from surface of the
liquid to the top of the siphon is limited to
34ft., practically to about 25ft. At greater
height the atmospheric pressure is not suffi-
cient to force the water up the shorter arm of
the siphon.:

Blasco de Garay is reputed to have shown in
the harbor of Barcelona a steamboat of his
own invention, but ■ the ; earliest authentic in-
stance is that of the Charlotte Dundas, built
by Symmington in Scotland (1801-02) and
used on the Firth of Forth. • (2) Although the
Surprise, built ,by . the Smith Bros, of Neutral
Bay and launched in March, 1831, was the first
steamboat to make her appearance in Port
Jackson, her engines were, not fitted until
July 23, and the Sophia Jane had, in the mean-
time, arrived from overseas'.
How to prepare a brine for salting meat,
and what time is needed for salting ? —2834.
Boil together 3 gallons water, 61b. salt, 21b.
sugar and 3oz. saltpetre; halve the quantities
for a small mixture. Boil at .least 30 minutes,
stir occasionally, and skim well. Strain into a
wooden tub, and let stand until cold, when it
is ready for use. A fortnight is the average
time for pickling a piece of meat, a longer or
shorter time for extra large or small pieces.
After the brine has been used;for some time it
weakens, and must be restored by reboiling,
with additions of all the ingredients in propor-
tion.
(1) What is the system of government of the
Channel Islands ? (2) Annual revenue ? (3)
Taxation? (4) Death duties ?— 2BBO.
(1) The islands are each administered accord-
ing to their own laws and custorns. Jersey is
under the control of a Lieut.-Governor, who
has a veto on certain forms of legislation,
and a Bailiff, both of whom are appointed by
the Crown. Guernsey, Alderney and Sark are
under one Lieut.-Governor, but Guernsey and
Alderney have a Government of their own,
and Sark is a dependency of Guernsey. (2)
The revenue of Jersey for 1932 was £325,934;
of Guernsey and her dependencies during the
same period £413,208. (3) and (4) A. M.
Coutanche, Attorney-General, Jersey, for full
information.
(1) Life story of a freshwater eel; where does
it breed, and can it travel overland from one
stream to another ? (2) Books or articles on
Jlie subject ? —2764.
(1) After living for some years in fresh water
the eels migrate to sea to lay their eggs in
deep water far from land. European and
American eels go to the vicinity of the West
Indies, and the Australian and M.L. eels are
believed to breed somewhere near New Cale-
donia. The young fish is like a transparent
leaf and is called a glass eel. It travels back
to the land, changes into an elver or 2£in.
eel when it reaches the mouth of a river, then
migrates upstream with its fellows, this move-
ment being called an eel-fare. On dewy nights
eels sometimes travel overland from one stream
to another. (2) “The Story of the Fresh-
water Eel,” by Anderson and Whitley, in
the “Australian Museum Magazine,” Vol.
11., Part 8, gives an illustrated account.
(1) Commercial value of sandalwood ? (2)
Method of preparation ? (3) Firms or brokers
who sell it ? —2652.
(1) Price delivered on trucks at country
stations in Q’land ranges from £l2 to £2l per
ton according to quality and size. (2) Logs
are usually supplied free of all sap, but some
classes are accepted carrying up to 25 p.c. of
sapwood. (3) Apply to the Secretary, Sub-
department of Forestry, Brisbane, forwarding
sample (a cross section about 2in. of the tree)
of the wood concerned.
(1) What proportion of flour, pollard and
bran should be mixed together to make whole-
meal flour ? (2) In the process of milling re-
fined flour, what becomes of the germ ? Does
it go into the pollard ? (3) Is it possible to grind
wheat satisfactorily for human consumption in
a small hand mi11? —2717.
(1) The addition of pollard usually makes
a heavy, sticky bread. You will get good results
by adding bran alone to the flour in the pro-
portions of about one part bran to three parts
flour, or more bran if you wish when you have
tried it. (2) The germ is discarded in the
waste matter which goes into the pollard. (3)
Yes.
A lasting polish for a black coal range ?
—2623.
Nothing endures long owing to the heat of
the fire. The best treatment is to blacklead
thoroughly and polish well, then keep in con-
dition by a weekly rubbing with a rag dipped
in dripping which has been clarified and freed
from salt by boiling in water and cooling. *
(1) Who was the inventor of the electric
telegraph ? (2) Where was the first British
telegraph line ? (3) Particulars of system used ?
—2958.
(1) No one person can properly be said to
have been the inventor, but credit for the intro-
duction of the telegraph in a practicable form
is due to Sir William F. Cooke and Prof,
(afterwards Sir) Charles Wheatstone. (2) It
was laid down on a section of what is now the
London and North Western Railway between
Euston Station and Chalk Farm in 1837. (3)
In the original system of Cooke and Wheat-
stone five magnetic needles and coils were used,
the current to operate each coil being conveyed
by a separate line wire with an earth return.
The system was both slow and costly owing
to the fivefold telegraph wire required.
Who was the inventor of the internal-com-
bustion engine ? —2970.
The earliest internal-combustion engines were
intended to use gunpowder. The first of these
was suggested by Abbe Hautefeuille in 1678,
and was followed shortly afterwards by
others, none of which was practicable. The
Lenoir, which appeared in 1860. was the first
really practicable gas engine. Two years later
a French engineer, Beau de Rochas, suggested
the 4-cycle stroke, which was adopted by Dr.
Otto in 1876. The 4-cycle principle is still used
to-day.
Biographical details concerning Admiral
Blake and his children ? —2965.
Robert Blake was born at Bridgewater in
August, 1599, the eldest son of a well-to-do
merchant. He was at Oxford for 10 years, and
then entered his father's business. In 1640 he
represented Bridgewater in the Short Parlia-
ment. In the dispute which followed its dis-
solution he was entrusted with the command
of one of the forts of Bristol; in 1644 he
gained distinction by his defence of Lyme
and, later, of Taunton, and he re-entered Parlia-
ment as Taunton’s representative. With two
others he was appointed in 1649 to the com-
mand of the fleet, and in two years had forced
the Royalists to surrender the Scilly Isles and
Jersey, their last stronghold. In the struggle
with the Dutch Blake finally defeated Van
Tromp in June, 1653. In 1654 he established
English supremacy in the Mediterranean ; in
1655 he burnt nine pirate ships after passing
under the guns of Tunis. He was now suffer-
ing severely from dropsy and scurvy, but
in ’57 he attacked and destroyed the Plate fleet
off the island of Teneriffe. Returning from
this engagement he died as he was entering
Plymouth Harbor, August 17, 1657. Next to
Nelson, Blake is regarded as the greatest of
the English admirals. No information is avail-
able regarding his children, if any.
(1) How to reverse the direction of rotation
of a shunt-wound motor ? (2) A series-wound
motor ? (3) Can a starting motor be used as
a 12-volt dynamo ? —2775.
(1) and (2) Interchange either the field leads
or the armature leads, but do not interchange
both field and armature leads simultaneously.
Reversing the supply leads will not reverse the
direction of rotation. (3) It could be so used,
but would not be practicable, as it employs a
series-wound field intended for a very high
current flow. The voltage generated would
also be very low.

THE PALETTE
At the Macleod Gallery
Most of the 70 pictures that make up
Norman Lindsay’s latest exhibition deal,
as might be expected, with the female
form, but, as if to prove an exception,
the largest and most ambitious —
“Apollo’s Vanguard,” a water-color —is
peopled entirely with men. The god is
backgrounded by station-hands rounding
up sheep, behind which again is a glimpse
of the sea, with a century-old ship in full
sail. Apollo turns to a pyramidal group
of the early navigators of these seas,
soldiers of the Rum Corps, sailors of the
wool fleets, squatters, diggers, sun-
downers, bushrangers, larrikins and
policemen. These, being men of action,
are, to Mr. Lindsay’s view, the vanguard
to culture, for they make of life the
material for art. It is a fine, large con-
ception, carried out with tremendous
vigor and gusto. Another water-color
with an Australian application is “Spring
Retinue,” in which a pageant of the
Dionysian sort is interspersed with sheep,
koalas and native birds.
Of the Oriental scenes that suggest a
Mohammedan opium-smoker’s dream of
paradise, there are several striking ex-
amples—“lndian Fantasy,” “Servants of
the Magicians” and “The Sultan Is Indis-
posed” are the most notable. The period
of powder and patches provides several
gorgeously decorative pieces ; “The Pro-
menade” and “Husbands and Wives”
lead in this section.
Some of the etchings have been seen
before, but “Merchandise,” “Priestess to
the Magi” and “Fortune’s Fools,” which
are new, are also completely character-
istic of the best-known Lindsay manner.
There is a group of pen-drawings, some
fnasterpieces of black-and-white tech-
nique and some, very much sketchier,
which seem to shake with ribald laugh-
ter. From the standpoint of pure art, the
handful of pencil drawings, all distin-
guished by unerring certainty of line, are
probably equal to anything in the collec-
tion.
S. Woodward-Smith, 25 of whose can-
vases are shown at the Grosvenor Gal-
leries, Sydney, has no objection to blue
skies, revels in hills and pines, and paints
flowers sometimes adorably, sometimes
provocatively, but always interestingly.
Best thing in the show is “Road with
Houses,” in which a characteristic scene
from one of the poorer suburbs that cling
to the skirts of metropolitan Sydney is
demonstrated to be beautiful. A flower-
piece, “Aquilegia,” is an effective study
in quiet tones, and the 12 pictures that
depict gently-rounded hills radiate peace
and security. “Suburban Window” is a
gallant attempt to make a decorative
panel out of the back of the next-door
house.
Pearl Sheldon, who since her last show
m Sydney has been collecting material
for her brush in England and on the Con-
tinent, shows her latest harvest of oils,
water-colors and dry-points at Anthony
Horderns’ galleries. Miss Sheldon has
exhibited at the Royal Academy and the
Paris Salon, and her paintings, particu-
larly of interiors, have a vogue. In one
respect she offers something new —-
water-colors on canvas-surfaced paper,
which certainly enriches the effect.
“Kitchen, Victoria Barracks,” an interior
more carefully painted than most of the
others, and some bright sketches in oils
of English cottages strike the eye most
pleasantly.
Bulletin caricaturist Ray Whiting has
been providing Melbourne with matter
for wry or hilarious laughter at the
Oriental. Some of the city’s best-lined
citizens are represented in their habit as
they live, and Theodore Fink is presented
in the altogether. Harold Gengoult
Smith is depicted inspecting centenary
uniforms for the Town Hall staff, and
James Barrett, the holder of the local
record for sitting on committees, is por-
trayed as a definitely comic character.
Whiting has a deft line, and, although he
does not always hit off a speaking' like-
ness or penetrate far below the surface,
often achieves an amusing synthesis of
his victims.
Douglas Pratt, a Sydney artist, en-
deavors to make his pencil say as much
as the brush in 25 drawings at the Fine
Arts, Melbourne. Straightforward in his
selection of subject-matter, he lets Nature
tell her own story, as far as his medium
and his knowledge will let him. Never-
theless, there is more feeling of light and
depth of tone in one or two of his etch-
ings than in the drawings, despite their
careful draughtsmanship; and he is
more at home in either than in his oils
and water-colors.
“M.G.S.”: The Felton Bequest’s latest
gift to Vic. National Gallery is “Miss
Gale,” by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and cost
£3500. It is a work standing well within
the conventions of the period, and is
therefore not one of the best examples
of the English master’s work, which has
one leg within those conventions and
another in the great open spaces of Rem-
brandt and nature. Nevertheless, it is
in many ways a charming picture. The
face is not the face of Miss Gale, but
rather that of a girl more or less conform-
ing to the fashions of beauty prevalent in
the eighteenth century. Those fashions
were better than those Hollywood has
fastened on the world, however. The
dress is a delightful thing, painted with a
loving attention to every detail but with-
out too much loss of unity. The back-
ground of trees and sky is what every
painter of the age felt it obligatory to
supply his models with, even if the sub-
ject was painted in a London studio.
Alongside the big canvas is a smaller one
lent to the gallery by a local connoisseur,
P. B. Hudson. It is attributed to Sir
Joshua, and is at least equal in artistic
merit to its neighbor.

SECRETS OF TUNE.
SIMPLE JOBS FOR THE OWNER-DRIVER.
BY FRED BERRY.
MOTORISTS who desire to keep their cars at maximum
efficiency, and at the same time to maintain the new-car
appearance as long as possible, should realise that success
depends mainly upon careful and regular performance of a
number of small but important jobs, most of which are well
within the scope of the average owner during idle week-ends.
Instead of driving merrily on week
after week and waiting for something
to drop off, the car-owner should culti-
vate the habit of making systematic and
thorough inspection of all important
units. Five out of every ten repair bills
accrue because of neglect or procrastina-
tion in the initial stages of trouble ; and,

although the modern car will still func-
tion —in a fashion—with incorrectly-
adjusted valves, carburettor, ignition and
the like, yet damage is being done, the
car is depreciating rapidly in value, and
the motorist is paying more for his miles
than he should.
The first thing to remember is that
attention must, above all, be given at
regular intervals and not in a spasmodic
fashion. It is much better to put in two
hours each week than eight hours once
a month.. Two hours each week is suffi-
cient time in which to lubricate all points
thoroughly and clean the car externally,
at the same time watching for defects
and remedying faulty adjustments. Left
for longer periods, many points of lubri-
cation become dry, water enters and rust
is formed, involving excessive wear.
Initial Stiffness.
Consider first the case of a new car.
When the machine is assembled, every
precaution is taken to draw all nuts up
tightly; but after a week or so on the
road they will, in many cases, have
worked slack. Although the service sta-
tion will do the work under guarantee,
it is not always convenient to lay the car
up, and the owner is wise who does the
job himself in a few minutes before harm
is done.
Body bolts should be tested after a
fortnight’s running, and again a month
later. By this time they should have
found their permanent seatings. Acces-
sories and all fittings must be examined
for loose bolts or holding-down nuts, as
if left slack for any length of time their
fit will never again be perfect, and they
will for ever after be a source of trouble
and annoyance.
As the car grows older, watch care-
fully for the first indication of play in
steering-box or steering connections.
Any slackness should immediately be
taken up, the same applying to shackles
and bushes in springs and running gear.
While on these regular rounds of
mechanical inspection and adjustment
the keen motorist will find ample oppor-
tunity to improve the “tune” of his
motor, making its performance just a
little better than that of cars not so care-
fully tended.
There are no mystic secrets involved
in “tuning.” While experts can get a
little better out of any given engine than
the novice can, and, due to long prac-
tice, can do the work with greater speed
and certainty, they follow simple, com-
monsense rules that can be applied by
anybody. These rules are: Do every-
thing thoroughly, pay strict attention to
minute detail, and as each adjustment is
made carry out a careful check of its
result before going on with anything else.
Altering Ignition.
The effect of tuning an automobile is
threefold : better all-round performance,
greater economy and longer engine life,
with increased reliability. Furthermore,
as both ignition and carburettor settings
of new engines as delivered from the
makers are at best a compromise, in
order to prevent stalling in the “running-
in” period, some degree of tuning is defi-
nitely necessary after the first 3000 miles.
On fully 75 p.c. of new cars operating to-
day performance could be improved ap-
preciably by slight alteration of ignition
timing and careful adjustment of the
carburettor.
The method to be adopted in altering
the firing point will vary according to

tact-breaker spring, (c) vulcanite heel
piece, (d) pivot pin, (e) cam ring.
whether coil-and-battery or magneto is
fitted. In the first case, it will be neces-
sary to remove the top of the distributor
and then, putting the starting-handle in
position, to slowly crank the motor until
the points in the make-and-break of the

distributor head begin to open. This is
the firing-point, the moment when the
electric spark jumps across the plug gap
and fires the compressed gases in the
cylinder.
HIGH-SPEED CORNERING.

ground. “Autocar” photo.
Now, as the object is to advance
this ignition point, the nut holding
the cotter on the distributor shaft is
loosened, and the whole distributor head
is rotated until make-and-break points
are fully open—roughly an advance of
10 degrees of rotation. This done, the
cotter nut is again tightened and dis-
tributor top replaced, and the operation
is complete. Care must be taken not to
overdo this adjustment, but a few experi-
ments on the road will soon determine
the most suitable “advance” for the
driver’s particular requirements. Where
“floating power” (rubber mounting) of
the engine is incorporated, amateur
tuners must be warned that it is a diffi-
cult matter to determine by ear when
the ignition point has been advanced too
far. In these cases the only certain
method would be to take the car to a
Heenan and Froude testing machine, and
so definitely fix the firing point to cor-
respond with maximum brake-horse-
power reading—a five-minute job.
Where a magneto is fitted the same
procedure with regard to opening oi
make-and-break points is followed, ex-
cept that the “advance” required is ob-
tained by moving a coupling between the
magneto and drive shaft.
Another feature of interest when ad-
justing magneto ignition is that while
most coil systems use automatic advance
and retard of spark, operated by means
of a vacuum, magneto types invariably
adopt manual control. The result is that
drivers seldom take the trouble to use
their ignition lever except for starting.
Magneto advance should be slightly less
than when coil-and-battery is used.
Road Trials.
If ignition-point adjustments have been
properly made a road trial should, so
soon as the motor has been thoroughly
warmed, show an improvement both in
acceleration and maximum speed, with
a corresponding improvement in fuel
consumption at average speeds.
The ignition should take no longer to
adjust than it has taken to describe the
process, and there should be some time
. to spare which can, with advantage, be
devoted to examination of other elec-
trical units.
Study the ammeter, fixed (as a general
rule) on the instrument board, and see
how matters stand with regard to the
profit and loss account of the battery
current. Unless the generator is at all
times charging the . battery at a greater
rate than the current is being consumed
by starter, lights, horn and whatever
other electrical equipment is fitted, there
is sure to be trouble ahead. Years ago
generators were required to replace only
current in the battery used for purposes
vof lighting; consequently a six-ampere
charging rate was ample. To-day the

load savors somewhat of a town power
supply, for, in addition to lights, there are
duplex horns, starter motor, cigar-
lighters, several internal lights in closed
models, illuminated instrument panels,
step lights, electric fans and, taking still
greater toll, car radio sets. So, instead of
keeping the battery going on a six-ampere
charge, at least 15 imperes are now re-
quired or the battery will soon become
‘■flat,’ particularly when free-wheeling is

;■ Avoiding Battery Trouble.
It follows that motorists must care-
fully check up maximum discharge
and requirements on the ammeter and
see the charging rate is fixed to cope com-
fortably with the load. This can be
jdone by advancing a third brush on the
generator until the desired charging rate
is reached.
~ T bis essential operation completed,
a further ten minutes should suffice to
inspect all wiring, distributor head and
coil for potential short circuits. Motor-
ists have on numberless occasions tried
lor weeks to locate a mysterious “miss”
in the engine. Usually plugs are blamed,
but it f requently happens that a new or
thoroughly-tested set fails to rectify the
trouble. Frequently this elusive “miss”
can be traced to shorting across the in-
sulation of the distributor head or at the
nose of the coil. Minute cracks develop
in both these units, due either to deposit
of carbon or accumulation of metallic
dust, and, as electrical current takes the
path of least resistance, the spark jumps
these faults instead of passing to plug
points. Close inspection will soon reveal
these minute cracks. To rectify the

trouble they should either be replaced or
repaired by carefully scraping all foreign
matter from the crack, filling it with seal-
ing-wax and sandpapering the surface
smooth. ;
Care of Lighting Equipment
Dependable as modern car-lighting
systems are, they demand care and under-
standing if they are to give of their best.
The motorist’s safety and that of other
road-users depend on good lights.
No matter how efficient the dynamo
and battery, it is advisable to make sure
that the lamps themselves are clean and
in proper condition. One of the primary
sources of lost efficiency in the lighting
circuit is poor electrical connection at
contact points. The small pins which
make contact with the bulb bases are
spring-loaded, and it may happen that
the springs have become weakened or
that they are corroded on their surfaces,
and do not slide freely in their guides.
Another possible source of lost cur-
rent is frayed wires, which may touch
part of the earthed casing in single-con-
tact systems, or strands of the opposite
wire in the double-wire system.
A considerable amount of light is
wasted by the use of dull reflectors, but
these must be treated with great care
when cleaning and polishing, as the sil-
vered surface is extremely delicate. The
proper method of polishing is to use a
fine rouge, applied with the lightest rub-
bing pressure, and a very soft rag or,
preferably, an old silk handkerchief.
One of the reasons why reflectors become
dull is that the lamp fronts may not be
watertight, allowing moisture to be de-
posited over the polished surface. Do
not use blackened bulbs, and take care
to have the lamps properly focussed.

THE MAGIC OF GOLD
WESTERN MINING REVIVAL
During a recent vice-regal visit to the
Coolgardie Goldfields, His Excellency the
Lieutenant-Governor (Sir James Mitchell),
in the course of his remarks at a public
reception by the Coolgardie Roads Board,
said....
‘•that he did not think that people
realised what gold meant to the
State. In the good days produe-
tion per head of population was
£BB. During: the depression this
had fallen to £53 per head, but the
increasing: production of gold had
added £l3 per head of the populr-
tion on the State’s production.
This increase was being reflected
in Perth, where Hay-street was
being rebuilt, as it had been built
in the early days of gold produc-
tion.”

Motor Oddities.
When motorists foregather the topics of conversation seldom
centre in technical or abstract features, but rather in personal
experiences or achievements.
Arguments wax hot where petrol consumption or speeds over
specified routes are concerned, and the cost of maintenance and the
present mechanical condition of cars after years of use are matters
of extreme interest. Huge annual mileages, old driving licenses, and
perhaps low car numbers support claims to experience, while many
drivers, with characteristic Australian ingenuity, have made interest-
ing emergency repairs.
Who holds No. 1 license or drives No. 1 car in each State, and
who drove the first car?
Who has driven more than 500,000 miles, and which driver
covers the greatest distance each year?
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not been
confined to racing drivers, while outback the bush mechanic,
hundreds of miles from repair shops, has worked miracles in order
to get the car home.
Motorists are invited to write to “The Bulletin” and recount
their experiences.

$ * s!= *
“F. 8.”: In Colorado (U.S.A.) during
a recent tornado 200 automobiles were
stalled on a paved highway owing to
static electricity upsetting their ignition
systems. The only motor vehicle un-
affected and able to pass a certain
locality was a petrol truck with a chain
dragging along. Under certain conditions
motor vehicles that have driven a dis-
tance at a fairly high speed store up a
static charge, caused by the friction of
the air against the sides of the vehicle,
and unable to escape because of the in-
sulation of the rubber tyres. It is for
this reason that petrol-tank trucks drag
a loose end of chain on the ground, so
that a static charge cannot accumulate
in the truck body and cause a spark that
might ignite the petrol. Toll-collectors
on the Sydney Harbor Bridge at first
received shocks from cars. The simple
expedient of putting a flexible steel wire
on the roadway to contact
with the car chassis before
the toll-gate is reached has
put an end to that trouble.

“Renap”; Sydney’s first
taxis were 2-cyl. Renaults
of 7-9 h.p., fitted with a
rather heavy type of lan-
daulette body—no protec-
tion whatever for the driver.
Two drivers were allotted
to each cab, working shifts
of from 10 to 12 hours
each ; they got 25 p.c. of
the gross and supplied their
own petrol, which could then be pur-
chased for lOd. per gallon —Pratt's
yellow label naphtha at that. The
fare was Is. flagfall and Is. per mile for
two passengers, and 4d. per mile for every
additional passenger. The license fee for
the vehicle was £1 and for the driver
55., for which he received an enamel
plate about 3in. in diameter, which he
was supposed to wear on his coat. This
rule was not rigidly enforced by the
police; neither was the 8 m.p.h. speed
limit. A good deal of gear-changing was
necessary, as such a rise as that in Wil-
liam-street called for low gear.
“Bull Nose”: Driving out to the West
Arm (N.T.) in an old T model Ford
truck we arrived at our destination, 90
miles from Darwin, to find that the
crankcase drain-plug had wobbled itself

engineer scratching for tantalite suggested
jellying a bar of soap as a substitute for
the lost oil. For 74 miles of the home-
ward trip the old ’bus carried on, though
she blew soap bubbles from every joint,
but at the Twenty Mile the big-ends
seized. We found the crankcase full
of bubbles, with not a drop of liquid.

be likely to prevent oiling up. In addition,
slack connecting-rod bearings in a pressure-fed

FOR THE BEGINNER.
Reading a Simple Circuit Diagram.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
This Page is often asked by would-be
home-constructors of radio receivers for
diagrams showing, in pictorial form, the
actual placement of component parts and
wiring. The plea is that the supplicant
cannot read a schematic diagram. Such
requests are natural, and there is some-
thing to be said lor the pictorial repre-
sentation. If it is faithfully depicted
down to the last .item, the constructor
needs to know very little about radio
fundamentals. He may or may not suc-
ceed in putting together a set which
works when he connects everything and
switches on. There are, however, dis-
advantages in the pictorial diagram.
A considerable amount of space would
be necessary to depict thus a fairly large
modern receiver. The constructor may
have a few components which are the
same fundamentally as those pictorially
illustrated, but not in physical appear-
ance, and he may try to use these com-
ponents. The result may be incorrect
wiring and failure to produce a workable
receiver, with, in the case of battery sets,
the unwitting slaughter of a whole set of
perfectly good valves.
This brief article is presented with the
object of explaining a few points about
the schematic diagram, an example of
which is illustrated in the circuit here of
a simple one-valve battery headphone re-
ceiver of the regenerative detector type.
Referring to this diagram, which the be-
ginner should keep for future reference,
the interpretation of the numbered points
is as follows:
1 and 2.—The aerial and earth connections.
3. —The aerial coupling condenser.
4. —The tuning condenser.
5. —The regeneration or “reaction” condenser.
6- —The grid condenser.
7. —The aerial coupling coil.
8. The grid coil (tuned circuit).
9. —The regeneration coil (also termed plate,
* feedback, tickler or reaction coil).
10. —The radio-frequency choke.
11. —The grid leak.
12. —The valve (three-element detector, or triode
detector),
13. —The grid (inside the valve).
14. —The plate (inside the valve).
|5.- -The valve filament (inside the valve).
16. —The headphones.
17. —The “A” or filament battery.
18. —The “B” or plate supply battery.
19. —The filament switch (on-off switch).
20. —Dot indicating that two wires are joined
together. Not always used. Wires which
cross each other without a loop indicate
that they are connected at the point of
crossing.
21. —Loop indicating that wires crossing each
other are not connected together.
Tracing the circuit from this schematic
diagram shows how easy it really is. The
aerial is coupled through the aerial con-
denser (always a small capacity) to the
aerial coupling coil. The other end of
this coil is connected to earth and to the
earthed circuits of the receiver. This
aerial coil is inductively coupled to the
grid coil, thus transferring energy from
the aerial. The grid coil is tuned by the
tuning condenser, and (he inductance and
capacity combination of the two deter-
mine the frequency, (or wave-length)
coverage of the receiver. It might be
broadcast or short
waves, depending
on values.
The radio - fre-
quency currents set
up in this circuit
are rectified by the
detector valve, with
which are asso-
ciated the grid
condenser and
leak. The plate of
the valve is con-
nected to one side
of the regeneration
coil, this coil being
wound on the
same former as
the tuning coil.
Ihe regeneration condenser is used to
control regeneration in tuning. It enables
the valve to be used in a most sensitive
condition, which is at the point just
before the commencement of oscillation.
The radio-frequency choke keeps the R.F.
currents out of the headphone and plate
supply, and thus makes the receiver more
stable in operation. The filament battery
is of the voltage suitable for the particu-
lar valve, and similarly with the plate
battery, depending on the plate voltage
requirements of the valve. Battery con-
nections are easy to follow.
The positive connections are marked
+ (plus) and the negative marked
(minus), with the negative connections
of the two batteries joined together. This
common negative connects to the rotor
plates of the tuning and regeneration
condensers, and to one side of the valve
filament. “Hand-capacity” in tuning is
reduced to a minimum when the negative
of the batteries is connected to the con-
denser rotors.
A little study will reveal that it is not
so difficult after all, and really a decided
advantage, to be able to follow a
schematic in preference to a pictorial
diagram.
MICRO-RAYS AND AVIATION.
At Lympne, on the Kent coast (Eng.),
Sir Philip Sassoon officially opened the
world’s first commercial micro-ray radio
service between the civil airports at
Lympne, Kent, and St. Inglevert, France.
This service, which is being jointly pro-
vided and operated by the British and
French Air Ministries, has been inaugu-
rated for the purpose of speeding up
transmission of traffic messages between
the two stations. It replaces a system
under which messages passed by land-line
from Lympne to Croydon, and were
thence transmitted in Morse code to St.
Inglevert.
The new service will be of value to
civil aircraft crossing the Channel, and
particularly to privately-owned aero-
planes and air-taxis which are not fitted
with radio, and, in consequence, are un-
able to summon help in the event of a
forced descent in the Channel. For
safety reasons civil aircraft not fitted with
radio are advised to circle Lympne before
crossing the Channel, and also to circle
Alprech, Calais or St. Inglevert on reach-
ing the French side.- Aeroplanes flying
from France follow a similar course.
If a machine does not report, or does
not circle within a reasonable time, a
search is made.
This new installation will ensure that
aircraft crossing the Channel from either
side on the Lympne-St. Inglevert route
will be reported in a few seconds.
Whereas under the old system messages
took 20 minutes and sometimes much
longer to transmit, aeroplanes flying
at only 100 m.p.h. crossed in about
the same time, or less if there was a fol-
lowing wind, occasionally arriving before
the message was received.
Rapid communication between the two
airports is made possible through the
introduction of a revolutionary system of
micro-ray radio communication, radiat-
ing less power than is required to light
a pocket flashlamp from aerials less than
an inch long and operating on a wave-
length of approximately 17cms., the
shortest ever put to commercial use. The
normal wave-length for civil air traffic is
900 metres, and for route-traffic messages
1380 metres.
The practical use of such a minute
wave-length was first demonstrated in
March, 1931, when two-way radio com-
munication across the Straits of Dover
was made. The wave-lengths are slightly
“staggered,” a wave-length of 17cms.
being used for transmission and one of
for reception. This slight “stag-
gering” enables duplex working to take
place simultaneously by teleprinter and
telephone. The teleprinter has been used
on land-line commercial telegraph services
for some years, but has hitherto been
used with Morse for experimental pur-
poses only, owing to the difficulty of
obtaining a wireless signal which is not
only of constant strength but is also free
from interference. The micro-ray system
overcomes this handicap, besides allowing
messages to be transmitted at a speed of
60 to 70 words per minute.
Signals transmitted by the micro-ray
system are carried to a device known as
“micro-radion valve,” in which are
generated waves oscillating at the rate of
1,700,000,000 times a second. These
micro-rays, as they are called, are led to
a transmitting aerial less than an inch
long, and are concentrated by two in-
genious reflectors into a fine pencil of
invisible rays directed towards the re-
ceiving station. As the rays travel in a
straight line, they can only be picked up
by a receiver lying directly in their path.
At the receiving end the micro-rays are
picked up by similar reflectors, concen-
trated upon another one-inch aerial, and
transformed by means of another micro-
radion valve and associated apparatus
into speech currents or .written words.
The reflectors are of aluminium construc-
tion and are approximately 10 feet in
diameter. They act in a somewhat simi-
lar way to an ordinary lamp reflector
which concentrates the beam of light
from the focal point of the apparatus.
Micro-ray is a special system which
will only operate on wave-lengths appre-
ciably below one metre. The extraordi-
narily short wave-length of 17cms. was
chosen because it is only in this region
that uninterrupted communication, free
from all possibility of interference and
atmospherics, can be depended upon at
all times.
Commercialisation of the micro-ray
system is regarded as an immense step

forward in radio technique, as it opens
an entirely new field for development.
The overcrowding of the ether has
seriously handicapped radio communica-
tion on the normal wave-lengths, but on
the Lilliputian wave-lengths used for
micro-rays there is ample room for the
simultaneous operation of an almost un-
limited number of transmitters and re-
ceivers without any sort of interference
with each other.
It is claimed that television, the com-
mercial development of which has so far
been restricted by the fact that it needs
such a wide wave-band for satisfactory
operation, will now have an opportunity
to go ahead in what -may be called the
“micrometric” wave-band without inter-
fering with any other forms of radio
communication.
Apart from its obvious applications in
world communication networks, the fact
that micro-rays are not affected by cli-

matic conditions, such as fog and rain,
opens up possibilities of extending the
usefulness of lighthouses when visibility
is poor. During some of the operational
tests since the system was installed at
Lympne, storm conditions, with wind
and rain, prevailed without interfering
in any way with the satisfactory opera-
tion of the service.
At a later stage London and Paris may
be linked by means of telegraph or tele-
phone via the micro-ray stations at
Lympne and St. Inglevert. This would
be done by linking the existing land
lines to the micro-ray system.

“V.E.”: While Kingsford Smith was
making history on his flight between
’Frisco and Brisbane I copied his signals.
Slipped the ’phones on my neck on one
occasion in time to overhear an excited
B.C.L. explaining to CQ in the shop how
he had heard the noise of the Southern
Cross’s exhausts the night previous from
a local broadcaster. Meekly I put in
that I was unaware that KHAB had a
radiophone, and received in return a
flood of technical advice. My mentor
turned to the shop-assistant. “Ted,” he
began, “this condenser” (it was a 4-mfd.
Alter) “is defective. I tried it on the
mains last night in series with a 50-watt
lamp, as soon as 1 got it home from you,
and the lamp lighted up.” “They do as
a rule,” responded Ted, “on A.C.” “1
want another instead,” said the pur-
chaser. “I suppose that he owns the
latest in sets?” I ventured to Ted as the
buyer strutted out." ‘Yes, a crystal set.

DISEMBODIED DRAMA.
The job of the radio entrepreneur is
to adapt modes of entertainment long
associated with the visibility of the per-
formers and with more or less elaborate
stage accessories to the limitations of a
box emitting sound. The makers of
gramophoue records had to pioneer that
road, and they developed a technique
which deserves more study than it
appears to have been given, in Australia
at any rate, by radio entertainers. In
the matter of what may be called non-
visual showmanship, the recorded items
that issue from both A- and B-class
stations are miles ahead of 90 per cent,
of studio efforts. Particularly in the case
of plays.
In the recorded playlet or comedy
sketch the essential constituents of bold-
ness of outline, snappiness of dialogue
and sureness of effect are well brought
out; the studio performances, with rare
exceptions, are over-wordy and not at all
convincing in the matter of non-vocal
sound effects. In many instances, the
plays are unsuited to the radio medium
because their point is too slight or too
well known.
It is pleasanter to refer to successes
than to failures. The performances
of “The Immortal Lady” and Shaw’s
“Devil’s Disciple” stand out; plays
eminently suitable for broadcasting
were handled in the right way. Both
are, in a way, historical, but they
don’t deal with the historical ele-
ments, as does a series that has been
emanating fdr several months from Syd-
ney—not badly dramatised, but too much
like “A Child’s History of England” in
content. The fact that one talented actor
plays several characters is more interest-
ing to him than to listeners.
Before radio drama in Australia can
become thoroughly enjoyable a great
deal more attention will have to be paid
to voices. Most of those at present assail-
ing the ether in drama lack distinction.
In the case of female characters it is
usually impossible to guess whether the
speaker is supposed to be 16 or 61. The
men seem to have no variants on a light
(yi*, a n, Oxford accent) and a
Chahapme-ike bass Children who
figure largely in juvenile fare, sedulously
cu | livate a sort of Cockney whine,
Almost a „ the radio dramat ic fare
o jf ered from Australian studios could be
improved by cutting dialogue. The most
effective offerings are arrangements of
stories of the O. Henry type. Bernard
Cronin’s “Rain,” which first appeared in
The Bulletin as a short story, was then
adapted for the stage, and recently
was given as a radio play, has all the
virtues which should be sought for —
brevity, strong dramatic interest, very

and , an e ’ ,dlns as , >°S>cal as it is unex-
pected. The short-story writers and the
£ la ywri ht such as sh y aw , whose works

on the stage seem to offer the most
prom ising material for radio entertain-
ment.
A prac tice that should be knocked on
t h e head in everv studio is the attempt to
combine the spoken word with a musical
background. It has been done more or

immemorial, but the stage doesn t have

Casual Comment.
“VK2NO”: During a yarn over the air
the operator at amateur station W6AWA,
of ’Frisco, touched upon amateur
radio from an unusual angle. Discuss-
ing the subject of good geographical loca-
tions for transmitting stations, he said:
I was down at W6QD’s place the other
day; wonderful position, looking out over
the Pacific and clear from screening in all
directions. When working with you
fellows down there he can gaze out
toward Australia and visualise just what
you look like.
What an imagination!

B station 2MO Gunnedah. (N.S.W.) is
the richer by the appointment of N.
MacNaughton to its engineering staff.
“Mac” is known in Australian experi-
mental radio circles as VK2ZH, and
visitors to The Bulletin stand at the
1934 Royal Show will recall his short-
wave transmitting and receiving station
installed there. This station worked with
a large number of Australians and
Maorilanders, and demonstrated how
short-wave reception can be maintained
despite severe electrical interference.

Of the “Wide-World Three” receiver
(B. 20/6/’34), L. M. Wilson (VK2LM),
Mudgee, N.S.W., says: “In daylight, 2BL
and 2FC are sufficiently loud on a
Philips dynamic speaker to be intelligible.
At night A- and B-class stations are’, on
an average, 75 p.c. maximum strength
with the same speaker. The output drain
at no signal is 6 milliamperes and 35 at
maximum volume. My usual receiver on
short waves is two R.F., detector and one
audio, and the signal strength from the
‘Wide-World Three’ is almost the same
as the bigger receiver. It is easily the
best receiver I have ever had, and inter-
ference from the house-lighting plant is
nil, whereas with the four-valver it is
awful.” *
Instead of fitting a shorting switch for
the bandspread condenser in the “Wide-
World Two” (B. 15/8 /’34), a correspon-
dent suggests that a more simple and
equally effective arrangement is to bend
over one of the condenser rotor plates,
so that when the rotor is almost fully
meshed the condenser shorts itself.
Apart from the convenience, it saves a
switch He adds that two or three points’
increase in signal strength may be ob-
tained by dispensing with the aerial
coupling condenser and connecting the
aerial direct to the cathode of the de-
tector instead of to the grid circuit.
Coupling the aerial to the cathode is
workable, but in the case of a long aerial
tuning “holes” may appear, depending on
the length of the aerial, harmonics of the
aeriabearth system, and the degree of
coupling between the cathode and grid
coil.
The number of broadcast listeners who
indulge in ether-searching when most
people are comfortably asleep is remark-
able. Many of the N.S.W. experimental
transmitters operate their stations with
recorded programmes after midnight,
and the listener who happens to use his
receiver for the first time in the small
hours is likely to find numerous “VK’s”
occupying wave-lengths normally used
by such stations as 2SM, 2CH or 2UW.
The letters the experimental stations re-
ceive are numerous, and, when those
with outstanding quality of transmission
cease operation for some reason or other,
they are missed. One of the most con-
sistent stations has been VK.2ZO, c.
Moore Park, Sydney. Pressure of busi-
ness during the daytime has compellec
him temporarily to suspend his after-
midnight broadcasts, which have bee:

What’s What in Radio.
Even 8.8. C. can make mistakes. It
is recorded that Lord Derby spoke
for some minutes to a dead microphone,
owing to a hitch in the control-room.
There was a similar occurrence at the old
Savoy Hill studios, when a great singer
gave a recital lasting half an hour to a
microphone which
was not, and could
not be, switched in,
although the red
light was on. The
singer never knew.
The reverse hap-
pened at a relay
station during a
session in which a
musical authority
digressed to tha
microphone in be-
tween the playing
of recorded items.
Suddenly the lights
failed in the studio
and control-room.
Th e microphone
and line amplifier,
being battery-oper-
ated, continued to
function, and the
station was still on
the air. Before the
astonished control-
engineer could
grab the fader and
cut the mike, the
occupant of the studio, assuming that all
was “dead,” hurled some choice epithets
into the ether about the supposed trans-
mission failure, and telephones began to
buzz insistently from scandalised ladies.
Writer was the control-engineer.
In England many radio traders use the
air for speedy delivery of goods.
A freight pilot was taking radio receivers
from London to Leeds. The machine
refused to settle down on the proper
course, and landmark checks found him
going crabwise. Deciding to land and
make compass investigations, he found
the trouble due to a battery-operated
receiver. The powerful magnet of a per-
magnetic speaker was pulling the com-
pass over 30 degrees from the true read-
ing. Removal of the receiver to a
position further aft in the fuselage was
effective.
Apparatus for dividing time into
periods of less than a thousandth part c(

Laboratory at Ashfield, N.S.W. This is
claimed to be the most accurate fre-
quency measuring instrument in Aus-
tralia, Although the instrument is sub-
stantially constant, it is continual!;
checked by using the rotation of th
earth upon its axis to keep a record of
time with a very fine degree of exacti-
tude. As this apparatus is, among oth
applications, used for checking wave-
lengths of broadcasting stations, it may
be said that the stars of the heavens now
play a part in the determination cf

all the 25-metre stations were too weak
to be of any entertainment value. At
8.15, HBL, 31.3 m., came on as usual, and
was fair until 8.30, after which strength
dropped so much that the talk (or lec-
ture) given was very difficult to follow.
Even FYA failed to come up to good
strength all day, and both GSD, 25.5 m.,

and GSB, 31.5 m., were very poor, with
GSB the better. The 20-metre amateur
band was less lively than the previous
week, with few Americans on ’phone dis-
tinguishable.
The following week at 2 p.m., FYA,
25.6 m., was back to full strength, but
GSD at 3 p.m. was very weak, and re-
mained so all the afternoon. GSB
opened fair and improved, but was* still
far below FYA at any time.
The location of FYA must be respon-
sible for reception better than the 8.8. C.
stations." The British radio engineers are
surely not behind the French in skill.
A week later there was an improve-
ment. At 7.30 FYA was quite good copy,
GSB, 31.5 m., fair, and at 8 a.m., when
DJA commenced, he was excellent with
a fine musical programme. HBL was
again disappointing, as by 8.30 he had
faded down. This is a contrast to last
year, when Sunday after Sunday he came
in at fine strength for the whole of the
lecture. By 11 a.m. FYA was only fair,
as was WIXAZ, 31.3 m., and FYA did
not improve later.
The best transmission of the day was
WBXK, 25.25 m., which was full volume
by 2 p.m. The short-wave and long-wave
notes were as interesting as usual, with
a long reference to a special programme
to be put over to U.S.A. by our own

Apparently WBXK gets many reports
from Maoriland, but none was men-
tioned as from Australia. Listeners were
asked to send in particulars of short-
wave stations heard. Comment was
made on the fact that 12RO had been

Paris, 25.6 m., was by far the most

afternoon transmissions of the Empire
station were not nearly as strong as a
few weeks previously, though GSB,
31.55 m., reached maximum strength for
the period between 4.45 p.m.
and closing time. At the

Slow Morse Transmissions.
“M.A.” (Canberra): A pity Sunday
evenings and the top end of the 80-metre
band have been chosen for slow Morse
transmissions from VK2XO. It is just a
gamble as to whether a listener will be
able to make use of them under these
conditions. Any other evening and any
other part of this band would be more
beneficial.
[Normally Sunday evening would be
the best period for such
transmissions, but heavy in-
terference is likely, particu-
larly at the top end (lower
frequency), owing to the
large number of experimental
telephony stations operating
there. Listeners interested
in learning Morse code
would probably not object to
any other evening. Wednes-
day, 7 p.m., at the high-
frequency end of the band
is suggested.]
One of the problems of
the farm wireless set is the
recharging of the A battery.
For those who keep their
cars or trucks under the
house (and many Queenslanders do)
this solves it: Run a long double
lead from car to set and tack the
wire to the floor joists, leaving enough
hanging to clip on to the car battery.
A hand hole to the battery is easily
fixed, and the wire can be easily thrown
aside when using the car. Use ordinary
spring-clip connections, and four volts
may be tapped off.
Latest in the Trade.
Of interest to battery-receiver users
and designers are the latest productions
of the Ever-Ready Company (Gt.

With the firm establishment of the
Superdyne type of battery as a power
supply with over twice the capacity of
the usual battery, a demand has arisen
for Superdynes in 60-volt blocks in
addition to the usual 45 volts. The 60-
volt Superdyne is now available, and
this is tapped at 221, 30, 45 and 60 volts.

With varying types of valves taking
up to 224- volts negative bias, requests
have been forthcoming for C batteries
of extra-heavy capacity. Accordingly
Ever-Ready has produced a special

volts, for use either as a C or B battery.
Used as a B battery, tappings are: Nega-

There is always something a manufac-
turer can do to effect improvement, and
of all components used in modern radio
receivers probably the most in need of
improvement is the mechanism for all-
wave or multi-band switching. After
much rough handling on the part of the
user switches are
likely to develop
faulty contact and
result in poor opera-
tion of the receiver.
Many designs of
switch es have
appeared, and the
latest and most in-
genious is the model
illustrated. It is the
work of the Com-
monwealth Mould-
ing Co., Arncliffe,
N.S.W., and bears
the well-known
trade-name Marquis.
The body of the
switch is of moulded
insulating composi-
tion, and examina-
tion of the vitals
brings to light un-
expected mechanism.
The contact pieces
are arranged on the
inside of a composi-
tion ring, and with
rotation of the
switch control an
eccentric disc, wiping inside a metal ring,
forces the surface of the ring in turn hard
upon the contact pieces. The action is
strong, and, in addition to the pressure
of the eccentric, the movement is a self-
cleaning one. The switch illustrated is
a four-section, six-contact type, and can
be obtained to suit any requirements in
any size. With the switch is supplied an
attractive moulded brown escutcheon-
plate, showing the positions 1 to 6, and
the control knob is of large-sized arrow-
pointer type. With this device contact
trouble should be entirely eliminated.
The Q. and A. Column.
Being in a non-power district in Vic., I
have specialised in battery receivers. The three-
valve Reinartz-type has been made, but in
five out of six sets I have run into trouble with
reaction. It is not smooth, and just as the
detector goes into oscillation there is a slight
growl. Also, I cannot get these sets to oscillate
below about 30 degrees on the dial. I know
nothing about radio other than copying another
set, wire for wire. —B4.
You are experiencing the most common com-
plaint with receivers of this description. It
is described as “threshold howl,” for the reason
that the symptom occurs just at the sensitive
point of detection. There are a few things
you can try. First, a change of grid leak.
Second, a change of detector valve. Third,
reverse the connections to the primary of the
first audio transformer. Fourth, decouple the
detector (see article). Fifth, connect a high
resistance across the secondary of the first audio
transformer (250,000 ohms). Failure to oscil-
late at the lower wave-length range indicates
that the reaction coil needs a turn or two
more. With series capacity control of reaction,
the coil always needs more turns than when the
capacity is of the “throttle” type (plate to
earth). Read a textbook on the elementary
side of radio.
In a receiver of the “Wide-World Two” type,
which valve would give the better results in an
electron-coupled detector circuit—the PM 12A or
the 15 ? How would sensitivity compare with
the auto valves, using 2-volt battery versions ?
—B5.
There is nothing, to choose between the two,
but the 15 is more convenient, being a heater-
type valve. Using either a PMI2A or 15 de-
tector and a PM22A pentode audio stage,
the sensitivity should be equally as good as
with the 77 and 37 (or 38).
Please advise me which to get of two types
of receivers, one being a tuned R.F. receiver,
the other a superheterodyne, both battery oper-
ated 3—BB.
As you are located approximately 300 miles
away from the main Vic. stations, the T.R.F.
receiver should be preferable. Some interesting
developments in T.R.F. may be expected in
Australia shortly.
I wish to build a short-wave receiver, bat-
tery type, using 2-volt valves. A list of the
components on hand is enclosed. Could any
of these be used in the “Wide-World Two’’
receiver ? —B9.
Suggest you build a receiver on the lines
of the “Wide-World Two,” using the type-15
valve as detector. The circuit is exactly the
same excepting that the suppressor grid is
internally connected in the 15. Consult the
valve chart for connections to the five-pin
socket. The audio stage could be a PM22A.
and this two-valve combination should produce
results quite equal to the “Wide-World Two.”
Your Gecophone variable condensers are just
the thing for your receiver, and you can use
the 10-to-l ratio audio transformer with primary
and secondary in series as a high-impedance
choke. The coil kits mentioned are useless.
The Royalty variable resistance may do for
regeneration control, but may be noisy. See
the article on this page for the circuit of the
“Wide-World Two.”
Is there an agent in Australia for the Eddy-
stone All-World Four, 1934 model, made in
England ? —9O.
Cannot trace an appointed agent, but Mur-
doch’s, Ltd., Park-street, Sydney, have handled
a few Eddystone lines. Communicate with
them.
Would the type ’45 valve in place of the
2.45 in the “Straight 1934 T.R.F. Receiver”
(“A.R.N.” 2/3/’34) be correctly applied as in
the enclosed sketch ? Could I use a speaker
designed for ’4s’s in push-pull? —9l.
The resistor in the centre-tap of the ’45
filament should be 1500 ohms and not 15,000
ohms; otherwise the circuit is correct. The
speaker with the push-pull transformer will be
quite suitable.
A five-metre transmitter (“unity-coupled”
push-pull oscillator ) was described last year in
“Australian Radio News.” ’llA-type valves
were used. (1) Would Mullard PM 4 valves
work satisfactorily in the same circuit ? (2)
If PMlA’s were used, would there be any
difficulty in getting them to oscillate at 56 me. ?
(3) If PM2A‘s were used as oscillator and
power amplifier in a transmitter, what maxi-
mum input could be taken without damaging
the valves (on 40 or 20 metres only) ? —92.
(1) Yes. (2) No. (3) Five watts.
On the afternoon of 6/8/’34 / heard VJT
calling VHZAT. What stations are those ? —93.
VJT is the R.A.A.F. station of No. 3
Squadron, Richmond, N.S.W. VHZAT was
probably a service ’plane in flight.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
“Themis”. London is mourning the
destruction of Waterloo Bridge, pro-
nounced long ago by sculptor Canova to
be the “noblest bridge in the world.”
It has become decrepit, and the County
Council, sternly utilitarian with Labor in
the ascendant, has decided to replace it
with a modern iron atrocity. The bridge
was originally built by a private com-
pany, which named it the Strand Bridge.
That was in 1809 ; it was not until 1817,
two years after Waterloo, that it was re-
christened.

“Bukshi Sahib”: Indian legislators and
the Nationalist press are kicking up a row
over a proposal to hang a couple of mur-
derer-brigands in public, one Babu paper
asserting that this is a return to medieval-
ism. Murder and robbery, especially
with the trimmings practised in n.-w.
India, are themselves mediaeval. There
seems no reason why the retaliation
should not also take on the same Old
World atmosphere. The two men have a
ghastly record of crime. Moslems both,
they would once have been wrapped in a
fresh pigskin before being turned off;
and that would have meant to them, not
only the destruction of the body, but the
eternal damnation of the soul.

D. A. Campbell, who left Sydney last
week for Cambridge, is one of the
most exceptional forwards that great
Rugby School, The King’s, has turned
out. Since 1931 he has been a member
of The King’s team, and this year led the
side to G.P.S. supremacy. A rattling good
breakaway, with weight and pace, he
should catch his Cambridge blue. Rowing
and the track at the Light Blue Uni. can
count in many Australians. Footballers are
rarer, though one thinks of the immortal
Sammy; Woods. In Oxford, on the other
hand, Australian Rugby blues have
always been as thick as fleas on an old
retriever.

Singer and painter H. Nevil-Smith,
back in Sydney from U.S.A., tells of the
street stalls from which artists sold
their pictures in Chicago and New York
when times were at their worst. At first
the well-knowns wouldn't do this, but,
finding that biggish prices were being
paid they pocketed their pride in order
to pocket the cash. Hollywood has
proved a good market for this Austra-
lian’s work. Novelist Gouvernor Morris,
who is busy writing scenarios, has one of
Mr. Nevil-Smith’s canvases, and so has
Cheiros, the horoscope-reader. Hollywood
likes Norman Lindsay, too. The visitor
has been commissioned by the Penguin
Galleries to discuss with Norman the
possibility of holding a show of his
water-colors.

“Spocket”: Opperman’s great ride
from Land’s End to John o’ Groats has
led many to wonder how the Scottish
jumping-off place acquired its queet
name. John o’ Groats was the eldest of
three Dutch brothers granted lands at
Camisbay byJames IV. of Scotland. The
tribe increased to eight, each owning its
own lairdship, and every year all met at
dinner to commemorate their settlement
in Scotland. At one of these meetings
a dispute arose as to precedence. John
settled the matter by building a house
with eight sides, eight doors, eight win-
dows and an octagonal table inside.
Thereafter each of the family entered by
his own door and sat at the head ot the
table as he conceived it. The house is
gone, but the lie still lingers.

“Pandit”: The curious Hindu custom
of fasting as a protest against something
or other has received much publicity
since Gandhi got it into the headlines,
and a message from India says it is
becoming “quite fashionable.” It is a
custom as old as Ind, and in some
respects has resolved itself into a profes-
sion. The professionals are an offshoot
of what might be called the beggar caste.
The organisation hires out its members
to folk desiring to have a wrong re-
dressed. If a man finds that his wife has
bolted with someone else or that a debtor
refuses to pay up, he resorts to the
society. This sends a member to sit on
the offender’s doorstep and fast until he
returns the missus with damages or sends
a cheque. So great is the obloquy attach-
ing to a Hindu whose obduracy results
in the death of one of these fasters that
only once in a thousand times does he
fail to come across. In the thousandth
case the faster expires on the doorstep,
and the society elects a new member.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Allowed to run loose by the stable,
Charles Fox (Son o’ Mine —Brilliance)
registered a most impressive victory in
the second division of the Three-year-old
Handicap at Flemington. Trained by
D. J. Price for a barrister who races as
“G. Ornong,” he had not sported silk
since March, and punters allowed him to
go out at 33 to 1. He led from start
to finish of the mile journey, and, with-
out being pushed, reached the judge
three lengths in advance of Colling-
wood, with the favorite, Cape York, a
close third. Cape York began slowly
and was second-last at the end of a fur-
long. He may soon atone for this
failure.
Charles Fox is bred to stay, and he
has been entered only for the Melbourne
Cup. His sire, Son o’ Mine, was third
in Trivalve’s Cup, and then broke down.
Brilliance was imported in foal to Apple
Sammy; she is by Clarissimus front
Bambusa, by St. Amant from Catalapa,
by Sundridge.
Robert (Burnewang—Hikoia) won the
other division of the Three-year-old. Lou
Robertson, who trains the colt for A. G.
Hunter, knows him to be a good ’un.
but did not anticipate the victory, and
odds of 12 to 1 were on offer. Obtaining
Bert; "What you jumping, about
LUCE THAT FOR ?r vv
<Gert! * Dont vdu see the
press Photographer:?'
I MIGHT APPEAR in the PAPEu ,
a rather lucky run on the rails when
Great Legend (the pacemaker) shifted
out and interfered with two other leaders,
Robert scored by a length and a half
from Takata (favorite), with John Wren’s
Angelo a close third. Robert is weighted
at 7st. 21b. in the Caulfield Cup and 7st.
in the Melbourne Cup. Hunter nomi-
nated a crowd of thoroughbreds for the
Victoria Derby, and Robert may be the
pick of the bunch.
Opinion that Sir Simper will be very
hard to beat in the Caulfield Cup is
strengthening in Melbourne. On August
11 he romped home in the St. Aubin
Welter at Caulfield, and on Saturday this
success was followed up by another in
the Nerrin Nerrin Handicap at Flem-
ington.
Sir Simper deposed Jack Holt’s candi-
date, Nuit d’Or, from favoritism. The
latter is a wretchedly slow beginner. He
drew ’ No. 1 berth, and was hopelessly
shut in from the outset. Starting from
the extreme outside, Sir Simper lost some
ground, but superior pace carried him
to the front early, and thereafter none
had a chance with the chestnut.
A four-year-old stallion, Sir Simper
has done comparatively little racing, and
he reads exceptionally well in the Caul-
field Cup with 7st. 51b. and the Mel-
bourne Gup with 21b. more. His stable-
companion, Chief Light, also owned by
Hazlett, was a certainty beaten in the
first division of the Highweight Handi-
cap. He has 7st. 61b. in the Caulfield
Cup and 7st. 41b. in the big Cup, but
he is six years old and has raced for four
seasons in M.L. without much success.
* * * *
Had backers of Diatomous paid atten-
tion to his condition before backing the
M.L. four-year-old in the first division of
the Flying Handicap at Moorefield, they
would have saved their money. He
looked like a Show horse and ran accord-
ingly. McCarten had him moving when
the barrier was released, and from the
rails he quickly took charge ; but Some
Boy had his measure after they had gone
a couple of furlongs. When Some Boy
faded, Roman Spear (5 to 1), after
running wide at the turn, went on to beat
the fast-finishing Frimsel, with Veilantif
a poor third. Diatomous was not
knocked about; slowing down to a
canter, he finished second-last.
Roman Spear is in the Epsom with
7st. 121 b. A winner of the Adrian Knox
Stakes, she might run a good mile.
The second division of the Flying was
a runaway affair for the locally-trained
Cabalist (7 to 4). Valcannah was second
and Dazzle —slow to start —third.
Ramrod is not in the big spring
handicaps, and it is rather a pity.
The son of Spearhead—Ramson has
come good. Backed from sixes to
threes in the Moorefield Handicap
he made light of his penalty for a
success at Rosebery, cleared out at the
top of the straight and won very easily
from Measure and Elmaros. The back-
ing of Nachara (favorite) was a surprise,
as the mare had shown no form for a
long time. She ran second-last.
Looking very rough, Koda Pen (4 to 1)
annexed the Hurstville Mile from
Buonarrotti (10 to 1) and the favorite,
Tatyoon. Multigris and Baltimore, well
backed, both shaped badly; Fame,
however, came home rather impressively
to run fourth.
Lingo (5 to 1) finished too strongly for
the pacemaker, Silver Song, in the
Kogarah Stakes. A good performance
on Lingo’s part, as he nearly came down
at barrier rise and was wide out most of
the way. The overrated Irish Morn,
backed to 6 to 4, had had enough
three furlongs from home. Winners of
both divisions of the Three-year-old were
ridden by Hickey, whose dad (Mick) was
a fine horseman in his day. On Neat
Star (7 to 2), carrying the colors of
Dick Wootton, he had to ride all he
knew to beat the Breeders’ Plate winner,
Fashion Star ; but Capetown (10 to 1),
his mount in the second division, “walked
in.” She is a nice filly by Spearhead
from Lady Capertee, by Tressady.

South Australian racing clubs report a
big falling-off in tote receipts for the past
year, with bookmakers’ fees as a partial
set-off and increased gate-money. Adel-
aide R.C. collected £7400 in insur-
ance on its burnt stand, but spent £3OOO
more in rebuilding. S.A.J.C.,.which owns
its own freehold, made a tidy : bit by
letting smaller clubs have the use of the
course. Now that book betting is legal
again in S.A. after half a century, there is
a demand for a few more days’ racing in
the year than was sufficient under the old
system.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Weights, 14s. 41b. apiece; no fall;
draw—such is a summary of the
“wrastle” between Haban Singh and
Penchiff at Leichhardt. The interesting
pair were certainly well matched. Singh
slipped out of many short-arm-scissor
holds easily, and gained a good lead on
points. But Penchiff unpacked plenty of
speed in the latter stages, and the deci-
sion was unanimously endorsed.
Footbrawl
Carlton v. Richmond, at Carlton,
meant probable elimination of the loser
from “the four.” A crowd of 32,000 bar-
racked the contestants while they battled
it out. Play was more strenuous than
skilful, and the harvest of damaged
shoulders and legs and bruises generally
was heavy. Ten minutes before the end
Carlton led by six points; then the
Tigers smashed their way to goal three
times: Richmond, 109; Carlton, 96.
Harris, of Richmond, deserves men-
tion for his cleverness. None of the
other games counted for much. South
Melbourne outed Essendon by 146
to 71, Pratt booting 11 goals and Nash 7.
Geelong gathered in 141 points to Mel-
bourne's 88 ; St. Kilda overwhelmed
Fitzroy with a late run, and scored 89
to 70; and Footscray downed North
Melbourne by 78 to 50. Collingwood
notched -160 to Hawthorn’s 73, the game
being notable for the vigor with which it
was played. One man collected a broken
jaw, another an injured shoulder, two
others cuts over the eye. Syd Coventry,
just returned after a three weeks’ rest
from concussion, was downed heavily in
a crush and was again taken to hos-
pital unconscious.

The Australian Rules match between
Queensland and N.S.W. at Sydney
Cricket Ground ended with N.S.W. on
top by 116 (17-14) to 82 (12-10).

The All-Blacks’ second game in Bris-
bane was against a fairly strong com-
bined Australian team, and they wop
11-6 —two tries, one converted, and a
p.g. to two p.gs. It wasn’t much of a
match, and now and then the handling
suggested chaps with feather pillows tied
to their paws tossing blocks of ice about.
The All-Blacks did show signs of a
plan. Their forwards drove up the
middle every time and swamped the Aus-
tralian inside backs. Both sets of for-
wards did well, Bonis again getting the
better of the hooking, while Victorian
Bridle was in’ grand fettle in loose and
rucks. Lilburne, at full-back, was far
and away the best of the visiting rear-
guard, and he should supplant Collins
in the second Test on Saturday. Kilby
will also be available after his injury.
Australia stands pat on the team that
won the first Test in Sydney. That
being so, it would do no harm to give
at least a couple of the side a dose of
monkey-gland extract before going on —
say, a pint each.

. Rugby Union grade games were re-
sumed in Sydney on Saturday. The
shock of the day was the 9-9 draw forced
by the wooden-spooners, St. George, on
the leaders, Randwick. Western Suburbs
beat Northern, 13-5 ; Parramatta pre-
vailed over Eastern Suburbs by 18 to 6 ;
and Manly (19) had an easy run with
Drummpyne (8).

The Rugby League semi-finals saw
Western Suburbs defeat St. George at
Sydney Sports Ground by 16 to 6.

“Old Q.”: There was a touch of uncon-
scious humor, in the statement that Hadley
was so injured in the match with Queens-
land that it was doubtful if he would
play again during the tour. It was care-
fully explained that Hadley’s hand was
so hurt as to be unusable. No one who
has seen the All-Black champion in
action would accuse him of using his
paw to start the ball back through the
scrum, but some of the giants of the
past, Black, Blue and Maroon, were not
above trying it once or twice when the
opposition was beating ’em badly. The
ref. was the chief trouble, but one or
two experts made little of that.
(Continued on page 36.)
Woodfull’s Men
The opening day of the fifth match
with England at Kennington Oval ended
with England’s cup of bitterness slopping
over. Hendren had had to drop out —
he was replaced at the last moment by
Woolley—and Jardine, Larwood and
Voce had not been asked to play. To
top it off, Woodfull outraged the tradi-
tions of the tour by winning the toss.
Ebeling and Kippax were substituted for
Wall and Darling.
Australia opened on a perfect wicket
with Ponsford and Brown, the N.S.W.
lad being bowled by left-hander Clark
for 10 when the score was 21. The
shades of night were falling fast when
the next wicket toppled. This was
Bradman’s, the young gentleman having
spanked up a riotous 244 in the mean-
time. Ponsford had backed him up like
the tradesman he is, and was 205 n.o.
at stumps, with McCabe 1 n.o. and the
total 475 for 2.
England banked on fast bowling, the
side including Allen, Bowes and Clark.
In spite of the supposed terror inspired
in Australians by this type of trundling
all three took a fearful lacing. Clark,
1 for 78, had the best figures. Bradman
was caught off Bowes by Ames just be-
fore time, and this made the Yorkshire-
man’s average 1 for 110. Ponsford gave
three chances, but in a score like his that
must be accepted.
All sorts of new records went up.
Ponsford made his first 200 in a Test
and the stand of 451 (in 310 minutes)
beats out of sight any previous Test part-
nership. The total is also a Test record
for one day’s batting.
“Canterbury”: Frank Woolley, great-
est of modern English left-hand bats-
men, if not the greatest of them all,
reached his hundredth century for Kent
some little time ago, but the county had
not forgotten. Early in the month he was
presented with £lOO to help him re-
member the feat. Grace, Mead, Hobbs,
Hendren, Sutcliffe and Hayward are
others to have turned the trick.
* * % ;js
“Aigburth”: Though Hammond hasn’t
had a sensational season against Aus-
tralia to time of writing this, he has been
running high and wide in county cricket.
For Gloucester the other day he made
302. That brought his total for the
county in seven innings to 1293 and his
average to 258.6. The only other
Gloucester man to top 300 for the county
was “W.G.,” who did it twice.
“St. John”: Bosanquet, whom old
hands will remember as a modest lad
rather overcome by his unexpected bowl-
ing triumphs in Australia umpteen years
ago, seems to have developed, like all
the rest of them, into a press hound, and
is filling columns with his opinions. He
wants all Tests played to a finish, argu-
ing that one taking more than a week
would be unheard of, wherein Australian
experience has proved him right. He
points out, too, that professional players
would lose no more by a week of Test
cricket than they do at present, when
two county matches are missed at a cost
of a tenner each through the four-day
matches.

“Onka”: The great heart of the nation
is supposed to beat madly when it learns
that some fiddle-faced brute has been rung
in, so we find the daily newspapers devot-
ing more space to the Redlock affair than
they gave to Lawrence Hargrave
throughout his career. The S.A. stipes
have found that one Prince rung in Red-
lock in the Trial Stakes at Kadina on
August 11, which the horse won, and
have disqualified man and horse for life.
The stake-money is to be paid to the
second horse, Jalisco, and second
money to Orada, which filled third place.
After .the finding the horse was im-
pounded by the police and Prince
arrested on a charge of false pretences.
“Redlock’s” identity is yet to be estab-
lished, but the indications are that he
is Erbie, a fairly good Sydney sprinter.

“Ex-Owner”: The glaring inadequacy
of the prizes given at Sydney suburban
race meetings got an advertisement when
Rogilla, winner of a division of the Fly-
ing Handicap at a mid-week Rosebery
meeting, returned his people a mere £46
13s. 4d. He was brought .from New-
castle to start at Rosebery, and trans-
port charges and fees took £lO 4s. The
owner had to be paid a third of the
prize-money by the lessee, Haigh. Pretty
mean returns for a horse which has won
a Caulfield and a Sydney Cup and
dozens of other big races.

“Solomon McHaggis”: That reference
to the possibility of betting taxation
being lightened in Victoria for book-
makers and punters (B. 8/8/’34) reminds
me that the lads in N.S.W., and particu-
larly in Sydney, could do with a bit off
the top. I am not worrying about the
punters —they are sealed to Satan in any
case —but over the men in what is really
a keen and competitive business. It costs
a man of standing £lO5 a year to open
his bag in Randwick paddock. He also
pays £7O a year Government tax. War-
wick Farm, Canterbury and Moorefield
charge the bagmen £4O a year for each
course. At Rosehill the poultice is £55,
and on top of that a further tax of £2B
for the four tracks. To bet at Victoria
Park, Kensington, Ascot and Rosebery
costs £6B a year each, with the good old
£2B tax plastered on. Then there are a
one per cent, tax on turnover, a penny
tax on each ticket, payment of clerks and
entrance fees to the courses and a dozen
other unavoidable expenses. No, the
modern bookie earns his brass nowadays.

“Redburn”: The £50,000 paid for
Windsor Lad (B. 1/ 8 / ’34) is not the
record for an English thoroughbred.
Mallaby-Deeley paid £60,000 for Call
Boy after he won the 1927 Derby.

J. J. Miller’s sporting annual for 1934
reaches its 59th year. The reliable old
publication recounts the performances of
all horses in the A.J.C. Metrop., Caulfield
Cup and Melbourne Cup, with winners
and placed horses in all the leading Aus-
tralian events. An innovation and an
improvement is the division of the
racing section and that devoted to
records and performances in other
branches of sport. Racing refeiences are
printed on white paper—others on pink.
Woodfull’s Men
The Australian match with Notts
ended unpleasantly. The county went in
its first innings for 183 —54 behind the
Australian first knock (Grimmett 4-70
and McCabe 3-42). When the Australians
batted again, Voce did not turn out, an
excuse being that he was shin-sore. The
crowd barracked the Australians badly,
and even the section which uses
the grandstand joined in hooting. Wood-
full declared with 2 for 230 (Brown 100
n. 0., Kippax 75 n. 0.). Notts lost 6 for
128, and the match was drawn. Carr was
on the ground, but hadn’t the elementary
courtesy to go near any member of the
Australian Eleven.
In pleasing contrast was the one-day
match with the Army at Aldershot.
Army made 110 (O’Reilly 3-17) and Aus-
tralia 7 for 194 (Bradman 79).
* * * *
“Parmelia”: A South Westralian tim-
ber-worker spent the fourth Test-match
period in the heart of the forest, miles
from nowhere. Returning to civilisation,
he eagerly inquired of the first man he
met “Who won the Test?” The answer
came promptly and somewhat dis-
gustedly: “Mr. So-and-so, of Donny-
brook ; but, gum! it was a close go.”
There was some vigorous cross-firing
before the axeman realised he was talk-
ing to one of Jimmy Mitchell’s “choom”
cowmen, feeling rather chagrined at hav-
ing been touched off in the local herd
test.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: The Australian Board of
Control has blundered badly by allow-
ing a Sheffield Shield match between
N.S.W. and South Australia in Sydney
to clash with the Woodfull-Ponsford
testimonial match in Melbourne on
November 23. It is to be hoped that the
members of the Australian Eleven en-
gaged in the Sheffield fixture—Brown,
Chipperfield, Grimmett, Wall and Brad-
man are only a few of them —will give
it a miss and put the whole of their
weight behind their skipper and his
cobber. The matter is really up to the
States concerned. They should notify
their players in the Eleven that they
“Why you don’t play Ropoama in te
front row? Py korry, he get te ball
for you nine time out of one!”
would rather see them playing in the
testimonial game than in the Sheffield
fixture.
* * * H=
“Bramall Lane”: Not bloodthirsty be-
yond the ordinary, I sigh for a general
proclamation sending to the shambles
the countless liars who have said or
written that they once bowled a ball
through W. G. Grace’s beard, or saw it
done. As a small boy in Lancashire,
writer always understood that the feat
led to the ignominious downfall of Cross-
land, a bumptious Larwoodian person of
the 1880’s who thought he was bigger
than the game. Later, I asked South
Australian Ernie Jones in Brisbane if it
was true, as the papers had said, that
he had done the trick. Ernie denied the
imputation with some heat, adding that
the blanky “reporters” were always put-
ting that sort of stuff on to him. Said
Ernest in justifiable indignation, “You’ve
seen the Old Man at close quarters your-
self, haven’t y’? Do y’ think anyone
could fire a cannon-ball through that
wire mattress?”
Footbrawl
“Hotham”: The unhappy experience
of Tasmania in the matter of pirating of
footballers by Victoria (B. 15/8/’34) is
not peculiar to it. When the South Aus-
tralians came to Melbourne the other
day, “pirates” descended on them like a
flock of crows on a seedy sheep. They
made it so hot that manager Hill, of the
Croweaters, spoke up at the reception
tendered the team by Collingwood club
and congratulated the Magpies on the
fact that they were the only Melbourne
team content to rely on local talent with-
out pinching other people’s. Westralia
has also reported the presence of scouts
attempting to sign up men for next sea-
son. It has been decided there that a
special time qualification be demanded
in the case of men going to Victoria, and
that the rule that 12 months’ disquali-
fication be imposed on such offenders,
which was adopted some time ago, should
be revived.
“Fitzcray”: The attempt to get the Vic-
torian Football Association and League
together for mutual protection (B.
15/8/’34) —the Association in particular
has struck very bad weather—has re-
sulted in several pow-wows between
delegates of the two bodies, but without
any result as yet. Many plans have been
suggested, but no one seems inclined to
take the bull by the tail and advise the
absorption of the decrepit Association by
the other body. The time has gone when
Australian Rules held a monopoly in
Melbourne, and the swift advance of the
Rugby Union is perturbing the old die-
hards of League and Ass. alike.
* * * *
There was quite a lot of miscellaneous
Rugby in evidence all last week. in
Brisbane the All-Blacks gave Queens-
land an unholy hiding by 31-14. The
locals had led 14-11 at half-time, and
enthusiasts had visions of the Maroons
at last rolling the All-Blacks in the mud
of defeat. The nearest Queensland ever
got to it was in 1896 at Wellington, when
it tied the home side down to a 9-0
win, and that in a real Maoriland mud-
puddle. Victoria won its second inter-
state match of the season at Adelaide
from South Australia with 35 points to
8 In Melbourne, Sydney Uni. defeated
Queensland in the final of the inter-
University tourney, in which four States
fielded teams.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: Whenever the All-Blacks
come to Australia the daily press turns
on the standing reference to the mis-
sionary work done by the Shivery
Islanders in preaching the gospel of
Rugby to the Australian heathen. The
opposite is the case. The first Rugby
missionaries in the South Seas were
N.S.W. players, who, led by E. Raper
in 1882, spread/ the glad tidings
among the Maorilanders. Seven matches
were played and N.S.W. won four of
them. It was not until two years later
that the All-Blacks took up the role of
evangelists. Captained by W. V. Milton,
they played nine matches, won five, lost
three and drew one. Nine years later
Australia had another visit from t’other
side, Tom Ellison leading the invasion.
* * * *
When the N.S.W.R.L. prohibited the
broadcasting of its matches with the
idea that its fading attendances would
improve it met much opposition. Last
week there was a strong fight, narrowly
beaten, to have the ban removed. Of
all games football is one not easily fol-
lowed on the radio even if the an-
nouncer and the listener are both experts.
The Rugby Union in Sydney, which has
permitted broadcasts of all its leading
matches, has found club attendances a
record since the war, while the games
with the All-Blacks have drawn huge
crowds.
The Nineteenth Hole
The Australian golf championships are
being staged in Sydney this year, Royal
Sydney running them. The first event is a
stroke handicap on October 6, open to all
amateurs. The professionals will have
their turn in a 36-hole competition on
October 8, when the amateur foursomes
title will also be battled for. The big
show, the open championship of four
rounds of stroke, will be played on Octo-
ber 11, 12 and 13. The amateurs have
their go at 36 holes of match play on
October 15, 16, 17 and 18. The first 16
lilywhites in the open contest pick them-
selves for the play-off. The professionals
have four days for their tussle, beginning
October 15, and here again the first 16
in the open will be the starters in the 36
holes of match play. All entries close on
September 18.
“Bawbee”: It has been wisely decided
to charge admission to the Australian
championships at Rose Bay. The money
obtained will be used to increase the
prize-money for the professionals, a
needed reform. At present a pro-
fessional winning the open gets £5O,
while second, third and fourth have only
£25 to cut up among them. A cham-
pionship meeting means the loss of
coaching fees and other oddments by
competing professionals, and these have
also to pay all exes. For the professional
title the prizes are £2l, £7, £3 * 10s.
and £3 10s. —chickenfeed, comparatively
speaking.

“ Woogaroo ” : Queensland’s first
close championship was won by Walker,
who is on the staff of the Ipswich club.
He had tied with N. von Nida, and 36
holes of stroke at Goodna were played to
settle the matter. This time the youngster
made no mistake and won by 9 strokes,
his rounds being 79 and 77.
H* H* %
“Quatre Bras”: T. H. Cotton, the
first Briton to win the national open
championship for donkeys’ years, seems
to have been impelled to golf by the
stings of adversity. It appears that he
was a keen cricketer at one of the Eng-
lish minor public schools, Dulwich. In
the eleven, he was not a prefect, and with
others like him was made to carry the
cricket bags of the potentates who were.
Dulwich must have been an extraordi-
nary public school for such a thing to be
possible, but Cotton vouches for it him-
self. He struck against bag-carrying,
was dropped from the school eleven and
turned his attention to golf.
Racquet and Bawl
“Reel Stalled”: The lad who writes
tennis for the London “Daily Mail” has
made open confession. He says that
every year he sees the ball cross the
net 6000 times daily for six months. The
ball —I am quoting his own figures—
travels 93 miies a day. As he sits oppo-
site the middle of the court he has to
move his head 10 inches for every stroke,
which means that his cranial m r.ement
is half a mile for every three five-set
matches. His experience has been mine,
but he makes no mention of interludes
which have brightened my lot. I
have seen only one lady player throw
herself on the court and bite a large
divot out of the turf when a decision
went against her. But I have noted some
1700 glares at umpires, 2333 sot to voce
remarks to linesmen, almost as many
blistering comments on the activities
of ballboys, and any amount of backchat
with caustic spectators.
* * * *
“Leges”: Interesting to me is the cabled
news that Perry is to go to Hollywood
to enact the part of himself in a film
dealing with tennis, his side-kicker, as
they used to call it in the old vaudeville
days, being Suzanne Lenglen. Passing
over the fact that something must have
happened to Suzanne to induce her to
take second place to anything or any-
one in the universe, let us consider Perry.
It is said he is to receive no salary, thus
preserving his amateur status. That is
beside the question, since he will infringe
two important laws, one being that he
must not appear in advertising or show-
manship stunts, and the other that he
cannot appear with a recognised profes-
sional even in “exhibition” games with-
out the consent of his tennis heads. If
this has been granted the cables are
dumb on the subject.
* * * *
“Let”: The first tennis tourney be-
tween A.I.F. players in N.S.W. came off
at Sydney White City courts last week
and drew a big entry. Players were
drafted into divisions, and divisional win-
ners met in quarter- and semi-finals. The
light was so bad that the final could not
be played, and it was decided to engrave
the names of the winners of the semi-
finals, A. Willard and Gornall and Cook
and Hancock, on the trophy, which is to
be played for annually.
Miscellaneous
“The Gaffer”: As an old owner of
professional sprinting strings, 1 have been
wondering what happened to Metcalfe at
the Empire Games when, after putting
up a new record for the hop, step and
jump, he couldn’t get within inches of
his Australian figures in his other events.
If it had been one of my old professional
peds. the matter would have been easy
to understand —the cows would sell a
race any time for a few shillings and a
pint of beer, if they weren’t watched and
guarded like a harem. But Metcalfe
being an amateur, any suggestion of
funny business is an impertinence. I am
thus greatly relieved to hear the real
reason from Dr. Martin, of Sydney. He
says it was “a case of inhibitions brought
about by an attitude of egocentrism,”
which, of course, makes everything as
clear as mud.
* * * *
“Long Dog”: Stung no doubt by the
monotony of the beastly gamble, an
English tin-hare expert has introduced a
new sort of quarry, which he says will
impart a touch of variety. Instead of
scooting along the edge of the course
at the end of a pole as at present, the
thing dodges about the track, and at the
end of the race sheds its skin for the
benefit of the tyke idiot enough to con-
sider it worth while. The chief point in
its favor is that instead of bunching on
the rim of the course, a frequent cause
of fighting, the dogs spread out and get a
cleaner .spin.
“Shinty”: The Australian women
hockey players, who have been, conduct-
ing a fast and furious shivoo at Perth,
have decided to issue next year a defi. to
the entire Pacific Ocean. Teams from
M.L. and the Fijis are confidently counted
on, and there is a possibility of getting
sides from Samoa and Hawaii. They
will be whites, of course, the average
dusky Polynesienne being disinclined to
exercise more violent than playing a
ukelele. Japan, where the women play
a lot of hockey, is also a possibility.
Later the U.S.A. may welcome an Aus-
tralian team.

BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
The Compleat Prospectus Writer
“D.A.”: The successful prospectus
writer nowadays needs to be trained for
the job. From birth he should be shielded
from the storm, stress and competition
of modern business; his natural opti-
mistic outlook must never become
clouded by contact with such things as
financial crises, bank smashes, over-pro-
duction, lack of capital or economic dis-
advantages. •
His literary training needs careful con-
sideration. Roget’s Thesaurus and a dic-
tionary of comparatives and superlatives
should be placed in his hand soon after
he has mastered the alphabet. He must
never openly subscribe to those old saws
about a fool being born every minute,
and the same gentleman and his money
being soon parted, but he may with ad-
vantage turn them over in his mind.
On the other hand, he should be taught
to preach that riches are acquired by
putting money to work, that the tide
taken at the flood leads on to fortune,
and that opportunity never knocks twice
at the same door.
He must cultivate a contempt lor those
who are content with savings banks. He
should learn the value of appealing to his
fellow-man’s imagination, and of con-
vincing him that a bird in the Pin us
insignis is worth anything up to ten
or a dozen in the hand. He should
always remember that nothing is im-
possible, that perpetual motion is just
around the corner, and that the next
shovelful may unearth the mother lode.
A book on vital statistics is indispen-
sable. The number of paupers—how they
became paupers should not be too closely
investigated—who die per thousand each
year makes a telling sales-argument. A
graduated scale showing the declining
earning power of men over 40 should be
hung in a prominent place in the office.
A chart should be drawn (and copy-
righted) showing the thousands of things
which can be made from wood-pulp. A
specimen case of the actual products
might with advantage be kept handy.
If a goldmine is to be floated, the
thousands of ounces won before the old
reef petered out in granite country
should be elaborated upon. The history
of gold from the time of Solomon, and
perhaps a page or so on the theory of
bimetallism (being careful to knock Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan through the ropes in
the last paragraph), may not be out of
place. The tedious, uninteresting busi-
ness of how much cash the promoters
take, the latest geologist’s report, and
details of contracts entered into should
be condensed into a few inches of non-
pareil on the back page. The engineer's
report of 1894, however, before the guts
were taken out of the mine, should be
starred in large italics.
If it’s a forestry-bond proposition, at
the first board-meeting a copy of the
Companies Act should be ceremoniously
burned, and the fact duly recorded in
the minute book. Options should be
acquired over land at not more than £2
or £3 an acre, but reference to this fact
should be carefully excluded from the
prospectus. Such irrelevancies, where
£3O or £4O is charged for planted acres,
are liable to cause needless wariness on
the part of prospective marks. /
Above all, remember that too many
cooks spoil the broth. Two forestry (or
gold-rnming) experts on the same direc-
torate may lead to clashes of authority.
Be safe. Only work for cos. whose
directors know no more about the busi-
ness than you do.
Oil from Shale
Those in the know were not surprised
when Imperial Chemical Industries de-
clined to become financially involved in
the resuscitation of Newnes. Anglo-
Persian Oil Co. is now reported to be
interested, and Sir John Cadman will
leave for Australia on August 24. The
British Government has a large interest
in Anglo-Persian, and the Empire de-
fence problem may be weighing in
Newnes’s favor.
In Australia the whole question of
local oil fuels, whether made from shale
or coal, is wrapped up with politics. As
a result definite progress is at a stand-
still.
Notwithstanding that the old plant is
badly situated, the Newnes Committee
definitely recommended reopening the
works, the shale to be hauled from the
Capertee Valley. Another enterprise, E.
and E. Hydrogenation Pty., proposes to
go ahead raising private capital for the
exploitation of a different area of the
State’s large oil-shale deposits.
The trump cards of this concern are
its new-type retorts and cracking plant.
“Don’t forget, now; you’re not to ’urt ’im — much.”
The inventor concentrated on the hydro-
genation process because less of the light
oily gases were lost this way. A small
commercial plant capable of treating two
tons a day is now actually working at
Redfern (Sydney); a Bulletin man in-
spected it in operation last week. The
syndicate claims a 98 p.c. recovery of the
crude oil in several varieties of N. S.
Wales and Maoriland shales, while
through the cracking process these crudes
yield 70 p.c. of power spirit and Diesel
oils. The residue is heavy Diesel and
fuel oils.
The secret of the success of this co.’s
cracking process is that each drop of
crude is treated separately by low-
temperature methods. It sounds impos-
sible commercially, yet this plant is doing
the job in a small space in a Redfern
factory.
The co.’s proposal is not to enter into
the petrol trade, but to attain an output
of 25,000 to 30,000 gallons of crude oil
per week. The power spirit turned out
by the process is of high quality—prac-
tically all petrol and kerosene. No ex-
penditure on refining plant is contem-
plated.
Adobe Houses for the Jobless
“J.G.”: I say “Hear, hear!” to
“A.H.’s” suggestion (B. 8/8/’34). When
1 lived in northern Vic. there were many
adobe houses, mostly called “German
.brick.” Then I moved south to a wet
district and began to make mud bricks
for my new home. The locals voted me
“dilly.” The first heavy rain, they said,
would wash the whole place away.
However, the home was built, and I
lived in it for nearly 20 years. It never
cost a shilling for repairs. The place
was cool in the hot weather and warm in
the winter, and very comfortable.
Strange as it seems, an adobe brick made
of suitable mud will absorb less moisture
than a burnt brick.
The place I built was reinforced by a
few saplings to save it from cracking
through expansion in the hot weather.
Barbed wire laid along every second
course of bricks would be even better.
A well-constructed adobe house would
be everlasting as well as fireproof. If
desired, the walls can be oiled and then
painted any color. Old sump oil from
cars or tractors would do. An even
better way is to mix a few pounds of
lime and cement together as if making
limewash, and apply with a whitewash
brush. This will give a light stone finish,
thoroughly waterproof. The bricks
should be cemented with mud, not lime.
Roosevelt has given silver a fixed value
in relation to paper dollars. Domestic
silver mined since December 21, 1933,
continues to be bought by the Govern-
ment at 64| cents an ounce. Other silver
has been “nationalised” at 50.01 cents.
Senator Thomas, of the silver bloc, calls
the move “a declaration that there is not
enough gold in the world to satisfy the
demand for money. It is a return to
silver.” Possibilities of inflation are ad-
mitted, but Henry Morgenthau, Secretary
to the Treasury, says there is no inten-
tion to use silver as “a versatile instru-
ment for large-scale monetary inflation.”
In London last week the sterling price of
the metal rose to nearly 22d., the highest
price since 1929.
Commonwealth securities have shown
a noticeable weakening since the pheno-
menal prices of a fortnight ago, in
some cases there being a drop of £2
per cent. One reason for the great
demand for Consols lately has been the
lack of other suitable securities for the
investment of trust money. Mortgages
are not favored —in N. S. Wales at any
rate.

C. V. Potts, president of the N.S.W.
Chamber of Manufactures, says that
factory employment in N. S. Wales is
reapproaching the figures of 1928-29.
Commonwealth textile mills—as The
Bulletin has frequently pointed out —
have entered a new era, and now con-
sume about 10 p.c. of the Australian
wool clip. The 1933-34 output of these
mills was double that of the previous
year. Building, metal, motor and wireless
trades have also come along well, says
Mr. Potts.

Imports of motor chassis into Australia
during the year to June 30 totalled
32,90(5, double the figure of the preced-
ing year. Britain and Canada supplied
a little over a third each. Peak year was
’26-27, when 118,952 chassis were im-
ported.

P.M.C.’s Department is to spend another
borrowed million on improvements. Trunk
telephone lines will be allocated £215,000,
and new buildings, etc., £182,000; the
rest is earmarked for purchase of tech-
nical equipment. About
£400,000 will go in Australian-
made materials. This is the
only good feature of the,
scheme. It was borrowing
that transformed the depart-
ment, for a decade or there-
abouts, from an asset into a
liability.

The Clyde has been stirred
by France’s attempt to out-
build Britain’s giant Cunarder
before it takes the water. The
plans of No. 534, the British
vessel, provide for a tonnage
of 73,000 ; news has reached
Liverpool that France’s Nor-

Australian butter continues
comparatively firm in London.
The price went up to 775. a
cwt. for Kangaroo brand the
other day, the best since
'November, 1933. Adding exchange, the
London figure is about two-thirds of the
regulated Australian price.

London interest in Australian gold
shares goes on unchecked. Gold Explora-
tion and Finance’s big float went over
without a hitch, touched a new
high record last week, and Gold Mines
of Aust. moved up. There is a feel-
ing in London that the dollar will be
further devalued during the next few
months, and that the sterling price of
gold will rise again. New York is buy-
ing heavily into British gold shows.

The meat industry figured for

last year. Value of every variety of

his ideas about life less from the con-
templation of human beings than from a
profound study of the works of the late
Marie Corelli and the poems of Ella
Wheeler Wilcox. An odd flash of eccen-
tric brilliance was the sermon preached
by the Rev. Herbert Messiter (Gregory
Hull). Gregan McMahon’s casting was
excellent, Charles Low, Nancy Ford and
Charles Tobin fitting their roles to a
nicety, and Kathleen Howell’s clergy-
man's wife and John Corbutt’s curate-
Satan being outstanding. But, on the
whole, Levy’s wisdom gave out a note
more suggestive of an empty barrel than
of a cornucopia.

Judge Beeby was brought before a
jury of his fellow-citizens three nights
last week by the Melbourne Little
Theatre at St. Chad’s, South Yarra,
charged with committing a comedy,
“Science and Sentiment,” witnesses in the
case being Dick Webb, Edith Bell, Mary
Guy-Smith, Brian Corbett, Frederick
McMahon, Leila Pirani and Florence
Cussen. Defendant was found guilty of
two extremely bad acts, but the jury
added a recommendation to mercy, on
the ground- that he had evidently
been keeping bad company and had at
least shown good intentions in the second
scene.

Adelaide W.E.A. is insisting on the
dramatic side of the Educational. It has
put up a good rendering of that grim
play “Rope,” particularly effective being
Colin Ballantyne, who tracks down the
corpse in the chest, and John Taggart,
mainly instrumental in its being there.

Chamber music is badly in need of
a lift in Melbourne, but there is
nothing wrong on the executant side, as
the beautiful playing of a brilliant pro-
gramme by the Sisserman Quartette at
the Wentworth reception-rooms showed.
The Bach Concerto for two violins,
played by Phillip Cohen and Frank
Thorn, left an enthusiastic audience
thirsting for more. Brahms’s A Minor
Trio, Op. 114, had the services of pianist
Henri Penn, Thomas White (clarinetto)
and ’cellist Sisserman, and they made
the lovely thing sound as if it were pro-
duced by a full orchestra. Gwendolyn
Evans brought intelligence but a far-
from-adequate voice to bear on
Schumann and Schubert songs, and the
evening concluded with Beethoven’s Trio
in B Flat, Op. 97, in which the great
Ludwig appears to have tried to work
out again some problems that interested
him in the Appassionata. Penn, Cohen
and Sisserman had obviously given this
item long hours of thought. It would
not be amiss if the Centenary Council
gave a few foot-pounds of its support to
this branch of the city’s activities.

There will shortly be two shows run-
ning simultaneously in Melbourne for
which A. P. Herbert is responsible. His
deft hand wrote the libretto for “Mother
of Pearl,” at present under Delysia’s
care at the Princess ; the other thing is
“Tantivy Towers,” to be staged by the
Firm at the King’s on September 15.
The music is by Thomas Dunhill, and
a feature of the production is that it will
employ singers from the Albert-street
Con., under Fritz Hart’s baton. Eileen
Kelly, who earned a J.C.W. scholarship
last year, and Beatrice Oakley, who won
golden opinions as Micaela in “Carmen”
with the last Italian opera co. at His
Majesty’s, will be the two principals;
and Minnie Everett will produce the
piece.

Despite gloomy prognostications to
the contrary, the Fuller opera repertoire
will contain more novelties and more
high-class works than the last two Wil-
liamsonian seasons, at least. From the
Wagnerian stable will emerge “The
Valkyrie,” “The Flying Dutchman,”
“Siegfried,” “Tristan and Isolde,” “Tann-
hauser” ’and “Lohengrin.” D’Albert's
“Tierfland,” Boito’s “Mefistofele,” Puc-
cini’s “Le Villi” and “Gianni Schicchi”
and Bizet’s “The Pearl Fishers” will be
new; and so will Johann Strauss’s
operetta, “Die Fledermaus.” The pro-
gramme resembles the ritualistic busi-
ness of former years mainly in the fact
that it will lead off at Melbourne on
Sept. 29 with a gala performance of
“Aida.”
v * *
At the celebrity concert at the Town
Hall, Melbourne, next Saturday, the
aristocrats of the symphonic tribe will
be introduced to members of the percus-
sion group which have hitherto never
been seen in Melbourne outside the
’alls. This is in accordance with
Grainger’s belief that the percussion side
of an orchestra should equal in import-
ance the brass and the strings. The
result will not be a more than usually
unholy row. Grainger claims that per-
cussion tone when properly used might
be compared to a “beautiful haze of
color through which the rest of the
orchestra is seen as one can see trees
mirrored in a sheet of water.” So there
you are!
* * *
An odd bit of good drama crops up
occasionally away from the haunts of
commerce, and of such was “This Was
a Man.” The announcement that the
piece had been banned in England and
that Beresford Fowler was making a gift
of it to the Empire for the first time
failed to stampede theatregoers into the
Queen’s Hall, Melbourne. Yet it
is the best Noel Coward show present
critic has seen, and better than the
Maugham play at the Comedy. More-
over, Mollie Locke’s performance as
Carol Churt was a finished piece of
work. Coward, always up to date, has
made the discovery that prolonged philo-
sophising on the stage is no longer in
demand in these busy times, and he
reduces his dialogue to spurts of machine-
gun fire, interspersed with chatter about
cocktails and cigarettes. Nevertheless, in
the second act this ceases to annoy as a
device, and begins to partake of reality.
This is the scene in which Major Evelyn
Bathurst, having convinced himself that
Mrs. Churt has wickedly betrayed his
greatest friend, invites her to his flat, and,
after telling her that she is an abandoned
woman and ought to be knocked on the
head, falls for her. Benjamin Bensley,
who assumed this part, is by way of
being a Fowler find. As tall as the men
in the Tiepolo picture at the National
Gallery and apparently as awkward as.
a crane, he conveyed with crushing force;
and more by accident than design the
character of an unsophisticated school-
boy confronting a clever and designing
female with the armor of his honest
thought, plus the ethics of the cricket
field, in the last act he is clean-bowled
by painter Churt, deserted by Mrs. Churt
and left morally without a shirt to his
back. Altogether an interesting show,
and well played in the main. Beresford
Fowler was adequate to the artist’s role,
and Gladys Kenn was a vivacious odd-
woman-out. A special centenary produc-
tion of “King Richard III.” by the re-
doubtable Fowler will have all the
Queen’s Hall for a stage on September
28 and 29.

In the list of dancers in the Russian
ballet led by Victor Dandre, Pavlova’s
husband, which is to be a feature of
Melbourne’s centenary celebrations are
Elvira Rone, Juliana Enakieva, Rostoff,
Olga Spessiva, Otto Kruger, Mdlle.
Bojkovich, Spessiva and Anatole Vilzak
and Lola Michel. Stern patriots need
not be perturbed at this rattle of Con-
tinental consonants. Previous Russian
ballets have been composed of exquisite
terpsichoreans with Slav patronymics,
but if you scratched an alleged Russian
you of ten. found a Scot, an Irish colleen
or a Sassenach. A member of Pavlova’s
ballet had a stage name that sounded
like an attack of asthma, but he spoke
with an Oxford accent, and his real
name was Robinson.
* * *
“Cauboy”: Why pianist Pouishnoff
should have thrown a parting brick at
Melbourne’s pseudo-highbrows it is diffi-
cult to know. Every entrepreneur
knows that the pseudos are the main-
stay of every art. In Melbourne there
is probably a more solid core of
genuine music-lovers amongst concert-
going crowds than in the other capitals,
but no impresario would grow rich on
them. As a case in point, perhaps a
hundred attended a splendid perform-
ance of a splendid programme by the
Sisserman Quartette recently. A poorer
programme, less efficiently performed
and far from fully rehearsed, such as
some of the fashionable “celebrity” con-
certs at the Town Hall, will be attended
by upwards of 2000. Here you will find
beautiful women, beautiful clothes, some
hundreds of students interested in “tech-
nique” and about the same number of
genuines as you find at a Sisserman
show. We ought to be grateful for the
pseudos, for they take the place of a
Government subsidy.


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
“Kaloa”: A year ago (B. 16/8/’33)
the Queensland branch of the B.M.A.
attacked the Commonwealth Govern-
ment for closing the Institute of Tropical
Diseases in Townsville and wiping out the
division of Tropical Hygiene. The
Director-General of Public Health
attempted no defence. He said the matter
was “one for the Prime Minister’s De-
partment.” The Health Minister, how'-
ever, rushed into the fray. He admitted
that “economy” was the cause, but said
that the job had been transferred to
“the school of public health and
tropical medicine which the Govern-
ment maintains at Sydney University.”
The anniversary of the contest has been
celebrated by an outbreak of a mys-
terious disease at Ingham, about 60 miles
from the abolished institute. Somebody
thinks that it is Weil’s disease. Over 60
patients are in hospital, some in a serious
condition. Some are on mattresses on the
door. A specialist and his assistant have
been rushed about 1250 miles from Syd-
ney to “do research work,” and mean-
while the cane-cutters of the district have
threatened a general strike unless special
measures are taken.
* * * *
“II Vecchio”: Circus proprietors and
sideshowmen always remember North
Queensland in their prayers. When all
else fails, the string of shows in winter
fill their pockets. This
year a dozen theatre
companies and big
rings have been
operating in the coast
towns from Towns-
ville upwards and
reaping a rich harvest
despite Greta Garbo
and the crooners.
Some of them look a
little tawdry after the
glitter of the picture-
palaces, but their
standard has improv-
ed since the ’nineties,
when spangles and a
camel were enough to
found a circus on.
One show I remem-
ber used to live on a
Frank Stockton lady-
and-tiger play. The
owner and his wife
and a half-caste drew
their act to a thrilling
point at which the
Lovely Princess (12
stone in a mushroom
hat when not busk-
ing) was forced by
the King to face the alternative of
her lover (the half-caste) or the
tiger, immured from the public gaze in
two pack cages. At this climax the
King invariably used to liquidate his
role and shout: “Now, boys. Back your
lancy! Which’ll she get —bloke or
tiger?” and having taken the odds he
would unveil the lady’s fate. This
element of sport saved the show when
the poor old tiger died and was buried
in Queensland soil. He was replaced by
a nannygoat draped in his skin, and,
when his late owner mourned for him,
his wife, the Beautiful Princess, used to
console him: “Well, daddy, tigers is all
right; but he didn’t give any milk, did
he?” —a very cogent argument in that
land of thin livings.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: If the Governments with
relief money to spend want a job which
really needs doing they might turn their
attention to permanent trunk roads for
the North. At the best, the track from
Alice Springs to Newcastle Waters is a
slough' of sand, and, while it would be
uneconomic to lay concrete, a high-level
earth-and-macadam track should be pos-
sible at a reasonable cost. A tourist road
from Brisbane to Cape York (say, of the
waterproof Indian Grand Trunk type) is
also a need. There may be strategical
military dangers in coastal highways, but
they are no more dangerous than
coastal railways, against the location
of which more than one inspector-
general of military forces has protested.
The journey from Sydney to the Cape by
road would make one of the most won-
derful scenic tours in the world, covering
a great variety of country and sport and
opening the Torres islands to the South
in a way which shipping services never
can compass. Another artery is badly
needed into the big-game country of
Arnhem Land.
“Sirius”: Though Australians would
not cheer the arrival of a new species of
mosquito into Australia, one has recently
been introduced into Fiji from Java. Its
larvie (Megarhinus splendens) are pre-
daceous on larvae of other mosquitoes,
and the adults are known never to feed
on blood. A close relative (M. speciosus )
occurs in North Australia, but does not
have so wide a range as splendens, and
on that account is less valuable as a con-
trol. Megarhinus is particularly valuable
for keeping wet cavities in branches and
trunks of trees free from larvie of other
mosquitoes; also for cleaning out the
übiquitous tin-can. 1

“Tourist”: Now the Barrier Reef
islands are full of trippers and the road
along the O.T. Line is being outlined'
with bowsers, how about something
new? Come down below Windorah and
have a look at the shifting sandhills—
those fellows which travel with the wind
and take fences and station buildings
in their strides. We won’t need a stop-
watch for this—an eight-day clock would
be too fast. And there are the mono-
liths in the river from which Stonehenge
(Q.) township gets its name. Or go out
to the Wetlands Ranges caves with abo.
sign-writing on the walls, and ride over
“Them Sydney crooks must be smart, dad. It says ’ere a tart’s just 'ad ’er
face lifted.”
the slate-rock plateaux with only an inch
of soil on top of them for miles and
miles. Fish in the Devil’s Hole up
Chaunsit Creek and know what it is to
hook ’em without a bait. Go down some
of those caves on the Barkly which reach
to the artesian water —300 feet below.
Go down Nowranie and leave a bottle
to be encrusted with lime from the
steady one-a-second drip of water. And
on the Burdekin Tablelands note Aus-
tralia’s Great Basalt Wall —a marvel
which runs for hundreds of miles, with
inlets and crystal springs where least
expected. Shoot wild pigs there, marvel
at the bird life, revel in the green couch
grass, lawn-like in its luxury. Have a
look at the Boulia mud springs, talk to
the oldest inhabitant —George Woods
(featured some time ago in The Bul-
letin), who had been Shire Clerk
for over 40 years. Go —go anywhere.
You can’t go wrong if you want tourist
sights in the North, so long as you go
off the beaten track.
* * * *
“McTarbert”: Loch Ness hasn’t it all
its own way. Outside Mourilyan Harbor
last week a party of Innisfail fishermen
saw a sea-serpent near their launch ris-
ing out of a sea as smooth as glass.
His body was 40 or 50 feet long and
eight feet across the back. He had a
turtle’s head, protruding teeth, a long,
snakelike neck, fins on his back and a
serrated tail covered with long spikes.
After he had come within 30 feet of the
launch and gazed at it for a time, while
“emitting a peculiar half-gasping, half-
whistling sound,” he started for the
Pacific, following the channel like an old
navigator. The Brisbane Museum’s
expert says that the animal appears to be
unknown to science and that he “would
like to have a specimen.”
iJe s{c ♦
“Wai Tui”: I can’t agree with
“Humo” (B. 15/8/’34). All the Kanakas
of my acquaintance have responded to
kindness. When properly treated, Kan-
akas become devoted slaves to the white
man, and will protect his wife and watch
over his children. When the overseer
tries the gentle method he is rewarded
immediately and continuously. Take it
this way: How many harsh overseers
have been attacked and even murdered
by Kanakas? And has anyone ever
heard of a considerate but firm overseer
being molested? I’m not a missionary or
a freak humanitarian. I’m a lumpy sort
of bloke with sleeves rolled up who has
seen both kinds of treatment in opera-
tion. Discipline, certainly—but kindness
and laughter are better weapons than
the stick.
* * * *
“Tripod”: “Beachcomber” (B. 1/8/’34),
when putting “Lizard Passage” in his
place over his statement that “winds
and currents bring no flotsam to the Bar-
rier islands south of Cairns,” offered to
produce articles from America or Japan
which have been washed ashore on
Molle Island. For this I will take
his word. The south equatorial cur-
rent, which comes from the west
coast of S. America and extends
down almost to Capricorn, sweeps north-
wards as it nears Australia, and perhaps
deposits debris on the whole length of
the Barrier. But when he mentions glass
balls from the shark-net lost at Coogee
he oversteps the mark and presumes a
current which does not exist. There is
a current from Noumea that piles
up garbage of all descriptions on
Coolum Beach (Q.), about 30 miles
south of Great Sandy Island. A remark-
able feature is the number of electric-
light bulbs, and, were a manufacturer to
see the annual haul, he would ask for
either a doctor or a dividend. The most
exciting item yet deposited by this cur-
rent is a mine (presumed to have been
laid by the German raider Wolf) which
came ashore in 1919. It is now mounted
as a war memorial at Tewantin.
* * * *
“Vic”: Any housewife whose worries
consist of a halfpenny rise in the price
of bread and the high price of frocks
should try a visit to the Katherine
(N.T.). One lifelong woman resident
wrote recently to the A.I.M. that her two
abo. housemaids had eloped, but that be-
yond that nothing much was happening
except that she had to keep her garden
watered three times a day without the
absconding labor and make watching
the alligators her personal concern, since
they had a habit of sneaking into the
home paddock and ripping the horses.
One poisoned near the station measured
18 feet long.
* ‘Australia Jane’s” Budget
To help wipe out the debt on the Queens-
land Art Society’s building, Miss Augusta
Hobday arranged an exhibition of her
pupils’ work. The show was opened by
F. A. Cooper, the Education Minister,
who remarked that his own boyhood yearn-
ings were artistic. Miss Hobday’s pupils have
been in the limelight recently.
The Federal Congress of the R.S.S.I.L. sat
in Brisbane last week, with the knighted Gilbert
Dyett as head serang. The Diggers visited
Coolangatta and the Tweed one day, and
were very interested in the homely banana,
which many of them never had seen growing
before. The South-eastern District gave a
smoke concert, and the Legacy Club spread
a high tea, while Premier Forgan Smith invited
the delegates to luncheon. An outing also was
arranged to Mount Coot-tha, but the weather,
previously all smiles and sunshine, covered the
boosted view with a thick layer of dust.
Things are flat after the Show fortnight. Only
a few country visitors remain. Daisy Marshall,
who marries E. J. Stanley to-day, was the
guest at an afternoon-tea hostessed by Mar-
jorie Weightmann at Rowe’s, but there have
been few private parties.
Brisbane women have a few suggestions for
their Royal Show Society. The Melbourne
Royal Show gives prizes for needlework. None
such is offered by the Brisbane society.
Violet Midson and sister Daisy, off to the
East by the Nieuw Holland at the end of the
month, are being tea’d lavishly by their
friends. The president of the Crdche and
Kindergarten Bridge Club, Mrs. Bruce Shearer,
staged one happy affair as a gesture of thanks
to Violet, who was one of those instrumental
in forming the club. Posies of sweet-peas and
daffodils and a letter-opener in the form of
a pewter boomerang were handed over to the
guest of honor.
Twenty-two school kiddies from Pittsworth
are having the time of their lives just now
at Lota, the seaside home run by the metro-
politan branch of the C.W.A. They range
from 9 to 14 years, and only one of the party
had ever seen the sea before. Mrs. J. Brady
and Mrs. G. Barrett are in charge, and Matron
Wilcher is keeping an eye on the youngsters.
Meg Patterson, of Toowong, daughter of
one of the mainstays of the Toowong branch
of the Social Service League, the C.W.A.
and various other organisations, is to marry
Malcolm Finlayson soon. Malcolm was one
of the late Bobby Kaye’s most promising , sing-
ing pupils. Lorna MacGuire, who is to be
a bridesmaid, gave a party for the bride-elect.
Ivy Halbert, who is up from Sydney, is stay-
ing with contralto Lena Hammond at Redcliffe.
Lady Barraclough, who has been spending
a holiday with the E. J. Watts at Belle Vue,
and who subsequently was the guest of Mrs.
A. H. Whittingham at Mayfield, has gone back
to Sydney. Mrs. Whittingham entertained a
large number of guests at a cocktail party just
before the lady flitted south again.
The Isaac Moores had a family house party
for the festivities. The Darcy Wintens came
down from Toowoomba and brought a daugh-
ter with them, and Valerie Baldock, of Ellan-
gowan, and Muriel Cobcroft, of Sydney, also
slumbered under the Moore roof.
Mrs. B. F. Yaldwyn and daughter Carlie
have gone to Sydney to attend the wedding
of a relative. Mrs. Duncan Nelson and daugh-
ter Mary—a debutante at the Matrons’ Ball —
also have gone south.
Tessa Reading, a sister of the Inky Way,
after some months in California with her sister,
Mrs. H. Freeborn Johnson, arrived in Brisbane
last week. Tessa has not . acquired an Ameri-
can accent.
The Nudgee College 0.8. A. did itself proud
with the annual ball. The funds raised go to
swell: the college: 1 bursary fund. President Neil
Macrossan (the college’s first Rhodes Scholar)
and his wife received the, guests, who included
the Governor. Lady Isaacs also went along,
as did Miss Amy Smith. The old boys
rolled up in large numbers. ; ' - i
The Ross Munro family are one of the
most united to be found in Queensland. The
Bells, of Coochin, run them a close second, for
they, too, move about in clumps, and are
happier in a family group than when enter-
taining. Babbie Munro, who rtiarried Clive
Reid, a son of the late George Houston Reid,
and her son and daughter; Mr. and Mrs. Jack
Chandler (she was Jean Munro), and Mr. and
Mrs. Roy Ross Munro, from St. George, all
gathered under the family roof for the Show.
August 25 sees the wedding of Alma Cocke-
rill, daughter of the J. Allan Cockerills, of
Annerley, to John White, of the Colonial
Administrative Service. He comes from
Brighton, England. St. Philip’s Church of Eng-
land, Thompson Estate, will hear the Voice,
and after a brief honeymoon the pair will
leave for Fiji, their future home.
Helen Archibald, whose home town is Sydney
but who is Brisbane-born —her grandmother,
Mrs. J. Archibald, is one of our oldest in-
habitants —is in England with her parents. AL
in one week she was presented at Court, she
celebrated her 21st birthday and became en-
gaged. The lucky man is Saen Millward, and
after she is married Helen will live in Eng-
land. With her parents, she is returning to
Australia in the Maloja.
Mrs. W. T. Robertson has just retired from
the presidency of the Moreton Club. Mrs.
Gilbert Lees is the new president. She lives
in one of the flats in Craigston, the towering
building on Wickham-terrace which commands
one of the finest views in Brisbane.
Lady Isaacs did a lot of shopping at the
Handicrafts section of the Red Cross. A
thing that attracted her attention was a wccl-
holder, the invention of a fed-up Digger who,
on a railway journey, spent most of his time
picking up the ball of wool that his vis-a-vis
in the railway carriage persistently dropped.
The members of the Historical Society held
a special meeting to welcome country visitors.
Inigo Jones, aided by daughter Ursula, greeted
the guests. Leichhardt provided the subject
for the two talks, one by Miss F. Lord and
one by Tom Welsby. Charles Gough told
all about the early days in Brisbane, and illus-
trated his lecture with lantern slides. There
was a good attendance, and Iceland poppies
in green vases made the rooms bright.
About 60 old girls of Craigard School
were present at the annual reunion at Rowe’s.
Miss I. M. Rutherford, president of the asso-
ciation and school principal, was presented
with a sweet-scented bouquet of jonquils and
violets. Hilda Donaldson and Doris Hender-
son, the two vice-presidents; Nancy Orr, the
treasurer, and Nancy Warren, the secretary,
helped to look after the guests.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The legend “8.8., 1934,” in golden
letters, suspended from an arch of
poppies, marigolds and arum lilies at
the entrance to David Jones’s, informed
the curious that the Bankers’ Ball was in
progress. To this came Lady Isaacs,
Acting-Governor Street and his wife, the
knightly Sam Horderns and. such lead-
ing lights of banking as the E. C. Riddles
and the H. C. Crickners. To it also came
1000 of the young people who all day
had been banging typewriters or balanc-
ing ledgers. These, after one or two
gasps of surprise at the richness of Lady
Isaacs’s gold and silver brocades, the
Patou-blue velvet-embossed chiffons of
the Acting-Governor’s lady, and the
Hordern lady’s pearls and rose-pink
leather fan, went on dancing under the
boughs of huge flowering peach-trees
hung with outsize Japanese lanterns.
President of the ball L. J. McConnell
brought Mrs. McConnell in windswept
white satin. Mrs. Cecil Purser, who
came with her doctor husband, wrapped
herself in black velvets, and Margery
Ward, of the R.P.A. Hospital, which
benefits by the flutter, wore white-and-
black-printed crepes.
Mayor Parker and his wife, she in
black velvets, were at Lewisham Hospi-
tal Ball, at the Wentworth, on Thursday,
and brought Miss R. M. Birkin with them.
Violets, stocks and golden daffodils
smiled from low bowls on all the tables.
President Mrs. Walter Burfitt clasped the
shoulder of her floral satins with a dia-
mente brooch. Miss Birkin was graceful
in beige and brown crepes. Miss K.
Egan (she was one of the treasurers)
lined her black velvet cape with silver.
Mrs. V. T. McPhee and Mrs. J. Ken-
nedy did their part, the one trailing mid-
night blue and the other powder-blue
crepes. Secretary Mrs. H. Daly’s choice
was frilled floral organza. Mrs. Toby
Brown covered her rose Du Barry satins
with a long smoke-grey moire velvet
coat, and Mrs. Gillies Kryser’s black
satins had a white satin corselette top
and kimono sleeves.
All the flowers of spring, but especi-
ally daffodils (3000 were brought from
Melbourne for the occasion), decorated
the rooms of the Masonic Club for its
annual ball. The daffodils were carried
in loose bunches by the eight debs., and
twisted with boronia they bordered the
tables. Hundreds of tiny Japanese lan-
terns twinkled from amid the greenery
and peach-blossom that canopied the
supper-room and from the flowering
peach-tree on the balcony. Goldfish
swam in the basin of the fountain that
held pride of place on the amber-glass-
topped official table, which was invisibly
lighted from beneath.
The debs, were very important people.
They had a supper-room to themselves
and a snowy-white cake, a gift from the
committee. Every woman carried away
with her a tiny crystal lamp on which
her name was painted, and the holder
of the lucky-numbered jazz cap snared
a gorgeous opal pendant, the gift of
Percy Marks.
Grand Master Dr. F. A. Maguire and
Mrs. Maguire and president H. L.
Askey and his wife were there, and they,
with Captain Bracegirdle and Lieut.
Finlay, kept the Governor-General and
his lady company.
Not unsung must pass the ladies’
lounge, used for the first time that even-
ing. This is really lovely with its land-
scape painted walls, its gay wicker fur-
niture and its striped awnings. Here, too,
goldfish swam. The light came soft and
golden from pale yellow globes, and the
canary sang on thinking it was day.
During Music Week, starting on Satur-
day, our step will be as rhythmic as our
dress. The wheel of motor-car and tram-
car will keep time with the beating of
wings of song that will float down from
the highest floor and up from the base-
ment of many a building inhabited by
eisteddfod bards. There are to be re-
citals and lectures in department stores.
The churches are doing their bit in the
lunch-hour. On Sunday (Music Sunday)
there will be special choral services at
three o’clock, and massed bands and
choirs will be heard in Hyde Park. On
Wednesday the boys of Aloysius will lift
their voices in “Pinafore,” and on the
same evening there will be a ball, plain
or costumed, just as you like it.
One of the most spectacular of the
week’s doings will be the pageant in
which the vision of Pan peers through
the ages, finally resting on the “Pilgrims’
Chorus” from “Tannhauser.” Evelyn
Kirk has designed and painted many of
the costumes for this, and for the scene
from “Le Coq d’Or”—the first time that
even a portion of this opera has been
presented in Sydney—and Mrs. Ferrari-
Passmore’s is the hand that is directing
and organising it all.
Here is George Johnston’s pencil
drawing of Sheila Lowe, another of
Sydney’s charming girls. Sheila’s hobbies
are dancing and riding.
Norman Lindsay stood well in the
background while Andy Watt, K.C., and
Will Ashton spoke words of praise for
the pictures on the walls at the opening
of his exhibition at the Macleod Gal-
lery. Both referred to his capacity for
work and the evergreen joy that a pic-
ture or book of Norman’s gives to its
lucky possessor. Again men were in
the majority at this opening.
Norman’s son Ray, tall and dark, was
one of the listeners, and would like, no
doubt, to have been one of the ap-
plauders. Another was nephew Peter
of the shining fair head. Surgeon Mc-
Kelvey’s lady wore one of the new small
sailors, and pinned hyacinths in her silver
foxes. Mrs. Toby Brown, Pat O’Connor
and May Courteney talked line and
color. Artists Dora Jarrett, in blue, and
Eileen Coghlan, in black, walked to-
gether. Peta Verry wore a big bow of
blue and white spots under her chin.
Came also Mrs. Victor Mann, Ted Scor-
field and his wife, Dr. Oscar Paul, Mait-
land Brown and Clarence Murphy, Mrs.
H. Braddock, in grey and black diagonal
angoras, the Orama’s Captain Cameron,
Mollie and Meg Watt, Mrs. H. Drury,
Lute Drummond, Nellie Veitch, with her
visitor Mrs. J. M. Mercer, Johnnie
Sands, aviator P. G. Taylor’s wife and
Mrs. John Jackson, Dave Souter and
Dale Collins. Howard Hinton and John
Banks, who had been to the show in the
morning, came early in the afternoon
and could hardly drag themselves away
at closing time.
Pearl Sheldon dispensed with the for-
mality of an opening speech, and herself
welcomed all comers to her show of pic-
tures at Anthony Horderns’ gallery. Old
friends like John Lane Mullins and Miss
K. Egan, both very familiar with the
originals of many of the scenes depicted,
were among those who congratulated the
artist on her work and admired the frag-
rant sprays of blue, white and pink
hyacinths she carried. Jennie and Alice
Bryant, Mrs. H. Vyner (a grand-aunt of
mannequin Margaret Vyner), Mrs. C.
Cowper, Mrs. T. Lane Mullins and Mrs.
Leon Lyons were others who made the
round of the pictures.
Joan Hannam got a rush call down to
Melbourne to take a part in “Heritage,”
and returned just in time to drink a
cocktail at her own birthday party. This
took place last week. In rooms filled
with the fragrance
of daffodils, lilies,
violets, hyacinths
and gladioli Mrs.
Hannam gave the
hand of greeting
to about 60 guests,
mostly young
people. A peony
glowed at the high-
gathered neck of
her black velvets.
Joan exchanged
smiles for good
wishes in field-
flower spattered
crepes. There
were 21 candles on
the cake. Among
the guests were the
Otto Bohrsmanns,
the Sidney Rose-
berys, Lela For-
s a y t h, Betty
Brasch, Nancy
Mac Naught, Tom
Crossing, John
Faviell and the
Jack Scott Fells.
Neither the long-
sleeved black vel-
vet Austral wore
on Wednesday nor
the dusky-vermil-
lion crepe woven
with gold threads
she assumed on
Saturday could
compare in beauty
with the white moire
velvets she wrapped around her for her
first concert. All were agreed on this,
as they were that the concerts have been
unusually brilliant. Acting-Governor
Street and his wife, she in black laces ;
the Harry Budge couple, her wine-red
laces covered with a mink coat; and Mrs.
Eardley Lushington, wrapped in floral
lame, were an interested group who, in
the interval, slipped round to the artists’
room to offer congratulations. The Kelso
King lady, pianist Pouishnoff, Hugo
Larsen and Charles Nicis were in the
audience. Eve Alwyn’s fair head looked
well over her Madonna-blue dress, and
equally well later above its sapphire-blue
covering cape with upstanding collar. Mrs.
Florence Taylor, Lute and Jean Drum-
mond, John Griffiths, Dick McLaughlin
and Leon, Amadio’s brother, and Mrs.
Leon were others who applauded the
artistry of the singer, of Amadio, and of
the accompanist, Raymond Lambert, and
who heard the popping of a champagne
cork backstage during a pause in Lam-
bert’s solo offerings.
To lift Black and White from its lowly
status as the Cinderella of the Arts is the
objective of the Painter-Etchers and
Graphic Art Society. Syd Long, presi-
dent of the group, is one of the founders,
as he was of the Black and White Society
of London, formed in 1920, which had
Frank Brangwyn, R.A., as its first presi-
dent. Members from almost all the other
art groups are enrolling under the new
society’s banner, and its first show in
November promises to be an outsize one.
Syd Long, in addition to selling his
150-guinea canvas at the Royal Society’s
exhibition, has had word that the Firm
has bought one of his paintings for its
new theatre in Melbourne.
Door.e girls are in the thick of re-
hearsals for their production of “Tre-
lawney of the Wells” at the Savoy on
Monday and Tuesday, and all hands and
the cook have been enlisted to help make
flowers for the setting. Molly Walder
plays lead. Her mother is lending Claudia
Beazley the ravishing blue taffeta frock
she wore at the Governor’s Ball, and
Woodward-Smith’s modernistic poster for
this old-world play promises to cause a
traffic hold-up in Bligh-street. Smith
Family Healthspreaders benefit.
Congratulations are pouring in on Jessie
Street, who wrote the words, and on
Lindley Evans, who composed the music,
of “The Centenary Song,” which has tied
with Mrs. Norman Albiston’s “Land of
Ours” in the Melbourne centenary song
competition. The dead-heaters share the
first and second prizes. There were 302
entries, and out of the remaining 300
there wasn’t one the judges considered
worth third place. Everyone in musical
Sydney knows Lindley, who is so tall
that he can always take a back seat and
yet see everything. Jessie Street is the
wife of Justice Street. The other prize-
winner, who submitted her work as Mar-
garet Sutherland, is a Melbourne pianist
who was trained at the Albert-street Con.
On August 31 Doris Fitton is giving a
first performance of “The Rose Without
a Thorn” for the Twilight Houses. The
organisers of the appeal, Margaret Allen
and the Gordon lady, are asking for
£l5O to £2OO to carry out some extremely
necessary repairs. In the houses, of
which there are two, one at Mosman and
the other at Beecroft, gentlewomen past
being able to help themselves and never in
a position to build up riches find a home.
Mrs. Arthur Allen had a very soft spot
in her heart for them; now daughter
Margaret is making their welfare her
concern. “The Rose Without a Thorn,”
which is woven around Henry VIII. and
Katharine Howard (Ann Gordon), was
one of London’s big successes.
The 19th Battalion is having a ball
on Sept. 5 in Hordern Bros.’ Florentine
room to celebrate the 80th anniversary
of the formation of the first volunteer
infantry regiment in N.S.W., of which
his Ex. Sir Charles Fitzroy was the hon.
col. and Thomas Wingate the first major.
The 1860 banner will probably be one
of the night’s decorations.
The Westralians in Sydney are to have
their annual “wongi” at the Allora tea-
rooms on Monday night.
A card game that is coming into
favor is known as Farmer’s Joy. It is a
variant of poker. Stakes are pooled be-
fore each hand. Dealer gives player on
the left one card. Then to the next
player cards to any number up to five
until there is a pair or a card higher than
the one dealt to the first recipient. Then
to the third player, till he or she either
has a better hand than No. 2, or has
received five cards. Any player who gets
five cards without improving on hands
already dealt drops out. The dealing
goes on in the manner stated till every-
one has five cards, when the best poker
hand takes the pool.

The decorations for the Homoeopathic
Ball in Malvern Town Hall were really
superb, the Malvern Parks and Gardens
Department having excelled itself with
banks of flowering shrubs on the stage
and three shades of pink cherry-blossom
making wide sprays of color over the
supper-tables. L. T. Schroder went home
with a silver salver under one arm and
a pot plant under the other, his booty
for winning the ugly men’s competition.
This innovation, with penny votes, raised
£465. A bunch of Mayors and Mayor-
esses was present. President Mrs. David
Carnegie wore black with lace vents inset
upon the shoulders and a velvet coat.
Joint secs, were Lily Capp in forget-me-
not lace and Betty Fellows in a dress
of apple-green moire, the longest of its
three flounces lapping the floor in a train.
Jean Fellows wore pale-blue matt crepe,
and Phyllis Mein was in white with a
swirl of gold round the shoulders.
Three lusty cheers greeted the news
that Angliss, M.L.C., had signed a
cheque for £lOOO drawn in favor
of the Blue Triangle movement. The
secret was let out at a rally of
business and professional girls in the
Town Hall. Every seat was occu-
pied long before the meeting opened. It
was Elsie Bennett’s persuasion (she
knows how many girls stand all day)
which coaxed nearly 3000 girls to squeeze
closer and accommodate many hundreds
who were waiting in the lobby. As each
of the 100 representatives from factories,
shops, Government and other offices
came in single file to present her envelope
she was presented to the Hon. Sara Van-
neck. Lady Huntingfield’s daughter is
following in her mother’s footsteps. She
is a powerful prop of the movement, and
her short speech was distinctly good. A
pictorial touch was a huge white triangle,
which gradually filled up with blue
squares upon which each donation and
its source were tabulated. There was a
mannequin parade after oratory, helped
by loudspeakers, from Miss Snelson,
Elsie Bennett, Mrs. Angliss and Gwen
Varley.
After making the Mont Albert home
of her parents, the R. W. E. Wilmot
couple, her headquarters for her Mel-
bourne holiday, Mrs. George Bemis has
embarked for her own home in Boston
(U.S.A.). One of the last and largest
good-byes for the visitor was the C. J.
Hendersons’ evening party at Menzies
amidst the scent of boronia and the
gaiety of daffodils, primroses and peach-
blossom. The hostess wore gold tissue
washed over with blue ninon, and Leslie
Henderson chose a beetle-striped gar-
ment running diagonally in scarlet, white
and black. Her brother Allan, who re-
cently made the acquaintance of the
heart of the continent, gave a talk on
the Mac Donnell Ranges, the Valley of the
Palms and the wood-and-corrugated-iron
settlement at Alice Springs. Mrs. Bemis
also did her bit nobly. In a gown of
black velvet she stood up and spoke on
America, its social services and educa-
tion, with an emphasis on the fact that
the country isn’t all highballs and
divorces and ladies and gentlemen look-
ing for other jobs now bootlegging is
no longer a profession. Among those
who listened were the Marcus Martins,
the George Youngmans, Alfred and
Dorothy Stirling, the Deighton Nelsons
and Dr. Marion Wanliss.
Polly Walker’s welcome for her sister
Valerie was stage-managed to commence
with a brass band as the Monterey pulled
into the pier. But Valerie upset prepara-
tions by jumping from the steamer in
Sydney on to the Melbourne express and
arriving three days earlier. However,
Polly’s part at the Apollo went off with-
out a hitch. While a squad of cleaners
was sweeping a bombardment of stream-
ers from the stage and stalls after the
show, and the artists were changing their
make-up, guests sipped cocktails in the
foyer. Afterwards they drifted on to the
stage, where a siege on the buffet tables
was somewhat relieved by a queue wait-
ing turns at a basket of buttered rolls
and a bottle of tomato sauce, and for the
services of a busy person in a cook’s
cap who lifted hot sausages with a toast-
ing fork. Among guests who danced
on towards 2 a.m. were a few officers
and passengers from the Monterey, the
American Consul and Mrs. Dye, Mrs.
Stan Lindsey, whose royal-blue decol-
letage was hoisted to a diamond buckle
round her neck, and Mr. and Mrs. Perry
Ballmer, she slim and fair with a baubled
tiara and a field-flower dress. D. F.
Peery brought his wife, who pinned a
trail of camellias to her off-white gown ;
the J. W. Clymers were there, and Mrs.
Ames, who danced with her Florenz of
the convincing Irish accent—though he
hasn’t a spot of the Emerald Isle in him.
Binbinette, the Pulteney Meins’ home
in St. Kilda-road, looked as if it were
having a party one night last week, with
lights burning inside and the red twinkle
of tail-lights for a block along St. Kilda-
road and down a side street. Phyllis
Mein, all in gold boucld, and brunette
Alison, in swamp-green satin with its
neckline coaxed into a cowl drapery
with gold lame, welcomed guests to a
house cosy with crackling fires, diffused
illuminations and a pair of supper-
rooms, one decked with gold flowers,
the other filled with pink and mauve
blossoms. Among those who made
merry were Ruth Rogers, whose gold
frock dripped into a train ; Violet Tivey,
in blue ; Natalie Wood, whose blue gown
dashed into a scarlet kick around the
hem and a swathe near the throat; Alan
Stuart, Esmond Jones, Harry Mason and
David Pittendrigh.
In Kyarra-road, East Malvern, there’s
at least one radio which was not switched
off from the beginning of each Test until
the last cricket news came through in
the small hours of the morning. It be-
longs to Mrs. W. M. Woodful], wife of
the Australian team’s captain, whose por-
trait by a Rembrandt camera is sand-
wiched here. Last week she exchanged
farewell embraces with her sturdy sons,
aged 5 and 2\, and boarded the Orama
to join her husband on her first trip
abroad. Mrs. Woodfull is an expert on
the theory of cricket, but she has never
aspired to become a sporting star her-
self. She plays tennis, and in her own
words “takes exercise on the links.”
The Past and Present Students’ Asso-
ciation of the Albert-street Con. showed
no timidity about putting on a programme
of songs at its reception for Strella Wil-
son. Miss Wilson wore silver foxes and
a mischievous feather on the top of her
black beret. She, Dorothy d'Orm and
Marie Doran are all old students of the
Con. Rita Pauncefort’s flat severe sailor
was part of her dusty-pink turnout. Mrs.
Fritz Hart wore a spray of boronia
pinned in her ermine—she admitted hav-
ing pinched it from the guest of honor’s
bouquet. Cherry-blossom was the only
decoration in the grim-walled gallery.
The Athol Shmith portrait is of Mrs.
Leslie Benjamin, who was one of Mrs.
Bruce’s henchwomen in the capacity of
hon. sec. of the matinee. Mrs. Benjamin
has been on the committee ever since, and
for the last few years has worked in addi-
tion as a voluntary helper. She’s a
daughter-in-law of the late knight Ben-
jamin Benjamin, one-time Mayor of
Melbourne, and her only sister is Mrs.
George Barrymore, *of Queensland,
usually referred to here as Freda Stern-
berg. Mrs. Barrymore was a journalist
and entrepreneur, having travelled the
British Isles and Europe with Melba.
Melbourne’s advertising tribe had a
night out at the Palais for the Advertis-
ing Arts Ball. Fancy sets who preferred
to dress on the spot sorted themselves
out in the marquee. Motor-tyres and
cigarettes danced with skeins of wool;
a pop-eyed Eddie Cantor engaged the
services of two snappy telegraph girls to
deliver flattering messages to a bottle of
wine ; a flower-seller deserted her Roman
soldier—he consoled himself with a cake-
container—and eloped with a rickshaw
driver. (A tip about rickshaws —lean
backwards and your steed may out-
distance his pursuers ; lean forwards and
the chase will be short.) A centenary
cake 3ft. high was cut at supper-time.
The band got tired of playing new fox-
trots and took a dive backwards to turn
“If You Were the Only Girl in the
World” into a slow waltz.
The Women Citizens treated them-
selves to a tea-party and some good
oratory one afternoon in honor of the
Peacock lady, as the first woman to
break into the Vic. Parliament, and of
Dorothy Waugh, a Vic. woman who
holds the job of Associate Professor of
Dentistry at the Temple University,
Philadelphia. Mrs. J. Rapke set the
ball rolling with her speech.
A new kind of cricket party took place
on Saturday night. Instead of settling
down in one locality, the participants de-
cided to accept one another’s hospitality
for various courses of a meal, picking up
cricket scores en route. Cocktails were
mixed at 6.30 by the Philip Carneys in
St. George s-road. Thence everyone
went to Glenbervie-road, for the Oswald
Benjamins had caused havoc in a colony
of oysters. Soup at Dr. and Mrs. Ellis
Gillespie’s made Malvern the next stop-
ping place. Poultry was piping hot in
the Toorak home of the Murray Smiths,
and decorative cold sweets were waiting
in the Roy Andersons’ dining-room.
About 11.30 the aroma of coffee arose
among the tinkle of liqueur glasses at
the Spencer Harpers’. Dr. and Mrs. John
Kelly’s radio was the magnet for the
final round-up, where dancing and the
phenomenal partnership of Ponsford and
Bradman kept things sizzling till 3.30 a.m.
A tip from the new dress shows is that
it’s to be a summer of trim suits and
slim dresses, with enormous shallow-
crowned hats poised on the top of stalk-
like silhouettes. There’s a backwards
urge about coats, a cowl inspiration
from the shoulders which a humpy-
back look to even a straight spine. At
last week’s biggest parade a lei of
organdie trimmed an ankle-length spotted
muslin. A taffeta coatee of tadpole-
green had a dorsal fin of accordeon-
pleating running parallel with the ver-
tebras. There were some feather boas
(very dangerous these —the Mae West
effect is never far away), and new things
are happening with furs. A silver fox
has married out of his race, he and his
white fox wife, looped in bolero cape
effect, giving the maximum amount of
warmth to the wearer.
Barbara’s previewings of centenary
clothes revolved round mannequins Mary
Guy-Smith, Margaret Finlay and Nancy
Greene. One of Miss Greene’s hats
was a veritable pancake, without even a
suggestion of crown, balanced by a
velvet ribbon round the nape of her
neck ; another dramatic chapeau had a
single lily placed under the brim, and
another twined to a thin stalk round the
shallow crown. Mary Guy-Smith rustled
taffetas under field-flower chiffons, and
Margaret Finlay was elegant in slinky
gowns with long, slithery trains. Among
those who were invited to the narrow
ivory-colored salon were Mrs. McCall
McCowan, Mrs. M. L. Baillieu, and two
Tasmanian girls, Winsome Warren and
Mollie Hoskins, who were intrigued with
Guelda Pyke’s wickedly-cynical masks
upon the walls. Mrs. Tom Luxton, Rosa-
lind Parbury, Betty Bellair and Denise
Finch were four young things whose
heads have been set simmering with
plans for new wardrobes.
A girl who has knitted a cardigan for
a very special lad and discovers on its
completion that the lad no longer occu-
pies the same niche in her affections
need never look far for a grateful owner
for her handwork. The Digger patients
at Caulfield Hospital are badly in need
of woollies to combat the end of the
winter chill, and are not at all fussy about
a stitch dropped or a row knitted purl
instead of plain. Many of the men have
beds outside, and are immensely pleased
at presents of knitted berets, caps, gloves,
etc. Handkerchiefs, too, are always wel-
come, and parcels of smokes addressed
to the hospital’s Red Cross Rest Home
will find their way into eager hands.
These Diggers can give us tips on forti-
tude. In a verandah cubicle is Tommy,
who always has a cheery smile, and there’s
Alick, who has been in bed since
the middle of the war. He has a cup-
board next his bed containing a griller
and some groceries, and with a little help
can turn out a batch of fried sausages
and hot buttered toast. The Government
now allows totally incapacitated soldiers
£lO per month car allowance. With his
grant Alick is paying instalments on a
car with a special body which can trans-
port his bed. In this conveyance, which
he calls his caravan, he was taken to
“Mother of Pearl,” the first legit, theatre
show he has seen since 1917.

THE statement by Labor leaders that the banks restricted credit
during the depression years is completely refuted by an exam-
ination of Australian Banking statistics for the years 1929 to 1934.
These figures are recorded by the Commonwealth Government
Statistician from returns rendered quarterly under Federal law.
£46,000,000
Increase in bank loans 1929 to 1934
Between the years 1929 and 1934 bank loans to Govern-
ments, trade and industry increased by £46,000,000. Of this
amount over £22,000,000 was provided by the Common-
wealth Bank and nearly £24,000,000 by the trading banks.
Honestly—is this credit restriction?
Does Labor really believe the banks have restricted credit?
THE FACT IS LABOR IS AFRAID OF THE TRUTH

Labor hopes to conceal its real aim—

The Naval and Military Ball in the
Palais Royal was a brilliant affair. The
naval commandant represented the senior
service, but the decorations were all mili-
tary, featuring lances, pennants and a
huge dummy tank. Uniforms were as
gay as frocks. There was a guard of
honor for his Ex. and Lady Dugan, who
were received by Brigadier J. L. Hardie,
Colonel W. Fowler-Brownsworth and
Commander S. R. Symonds. The Gov-
ernor’s wife disclosed pale-blue and
maize-silver tissue beneath a coat of
silver lame. Mrs. Hardie chose deep-
cream angel-skin lace; Mrs. Symonds
was frocked in Lido-blue silk lace with
silver lame on the bodice. Premier
Butler’s wife was in pale-grey chiffon,
and the Acting-Mayoress (Mrs. Dunstan)
had fine black lace veiling silver tissue.
Betty, daughter of Major and Mrs. C.
R. V. Wright, made her debut, and was
presented to vice-royalty by Mrs. Fowler
Brownsworth. Prior to the ball Colonel
and Mrs. A. K. Wendt gave a dinner
party at the Oriental.
There was a big muster for the Adel-
aide Hunt Club’s point-to-point steeple-
chase held at Oakbank. His Ex. and
staff were present, their first trip into the
hills. President H. D. Young received
the v.-r. party. His daughter Nora was
with him in a brown tweed tailored suit
with a brown felt hat. The club’s secre-
tary, Irvine Wald, brought his pretty
young wife and his cousin, Peggy Dale,
of Sydney. Fur coats were much in
evidence.
Lady Dugan, in a brown ensemble
with a pale-pink tunic, was at the Kinder-

president of the N.C.W., made a speech
of welcome, to which the guest of honor
made a graceful response after which
there was music, followed by alternoon-
tea. Lady Dugan wore a navy marocain

were received by Prof, and Mrs. H. J.
Wilkinson and Mrs. J. C. McKail. Mrs.
Wilkinson was in wine-toned marocain,
worn with a chiffon velvet coat, and Mrs.
McKail chose black satin. Bright fires
made the night cheery.
Next night the refectory housed the
Commerce Students’ Ball. Almond-
blossom figured largely in the decora-
tions. The guests were received by Mr.
and Mrs. E. W. Mills and M. Garrett
(president of the Commerce Students’
Association). Mrs. Mills wore pale-green
and pink floral chiffon.

of-honor pews ; Telsa Gloe did secre-
tarial duties in whipped-cream taffetas
and lace, with Nancy Walker’s dryad-
green taffetas perched at her right hand ;
Thelma Rose swam in a pool of tur-
quoise velvet; Kath Edwards warmed
moss-green marocain with monkey fur ;
Joyce Anderson splashed honey crepes
with diamente, and Phyllis Troy aired
old-world primrose-brocaded satin.
Not content with one rendering of
Vaughan Williams’s “Magnificat,” the
audience of the Oriana Ladies’ Choir in-
sisted on a repeat at the close of the
recital. Ida GeddeS’s rich contralto sent
up the Virgin’s cry of joy, with paeans
from the pastel-gowned choristers arid an
obbligato from T. W. Glassfurd’s violin.
A. J. Leckie conducted, and president
Elizabeth Hamilton and secretary Mrs.
Cecil Treadgold swelled the chorus.
Inter-State women hockey players
wound up a strenuous carnival with
dinner at the Palace. W.A.’s president,
Mrs. W. H. Rigg, ushered in a welter of
feminine flipperies, widely different from
the workmanlike tunics of the playing
field. Toasts and speeches went with the.-
courses; the soup heard the winning
Tasmanian team lauded and Miss
Charlcsworth’s response; and with the
savories came the distribution of um-
pires’ badges. Each team will carry
away an autographed flag of the W.A.

Huge logs, crackling merrily in the
wide fireplace, warmed the dancers at
King’s Park Tennis Club pavilion. Mrs.
Howard Bonner’s scintillating sequins re-
flected the glow from the flames; Mrs.
Frank Cockshott’s meadow-green laces
were close by ; Mrs. Bunny Rex found
room for her brocades and rose velvet
train; Jean Simpson’s velvets matched
the flickers, and Beulah Holm’s golden
satins caught the lights.
The Alfred Carsons’ golden wedding
was celebrated by the Silver Chain Nurs-
ing Association in a setting of golden
flowers at the Green Gate. Still presi-
dent of the society after 24 years’ ser-
vice, Mr. Carson and his work were
eulogised sincerely by Mr. Grieg, Mr.
Wheedon and Mrs. A. E. Joyner. With
the presentations went a novelty bouquet
of dahlias and red and white roses
carved from swedes, beetroots and white
turnips.
The inter-State men’s hockey team had
a rousing farewell at a dance in the
Parish Hall, Claremont. Mrs. Tregon-
ning, who came along in a green-and-
silver Plantagenet Court dress, organised
the affair, and her medico husband, as
a “Don’t Care Sailor,” responded to C.
Carne’s good-wishes speech.
Laelia Finneberg aired the green of
her country in a marocain ensemble as
honored guest at Gladys Pendred’s morn-
ing-tea party. The lounge of the Kinder-
garten Training College, where Miss
Pendred is principal, had its tables and
alcoves massed with English marigolds
and Iceland poppies, ’twixt which moved
the guests. Laelia’s one and only recital
in Perth is to augment funds for the Kin-
dergarten Union.
TASMANIA.
The Citizens’ Ball, long incubated,
hatched out with great effect in the City
Hall, with over 600 dancers. His Ex.
brought Lady Clark in midnight-blue
lace. The v.-r. party included Lieut.-
Gov. Lewis and his lady, looking very
handsome in soft pale blue ; the Com-
mandant and Mrs. Whitham, Lieut.-
Com. and Mrs. Heriot, knight John
Evans and Miss Evans and Bishop Hay
and his wife. The , lounge decorations
and colored, lights were very effective,
and the galleries were full of onlookers.
The Uni. Ball, grown too big for its
old quarters, was staged at the Con-
tinental. Supper-tables looked Japanesy
with their sprays of red and white
japonica. All the brasshats of the Shop
were in the official party, which also in-
cluded the Mayor and Mayoress. Plenty
of trained frocks were to be seen, but
the girls haven’t yet learned to manage
them properly, and they don’t show t<s
advantage on a modern wearer unless
she is standing still.
The Midland Hunt Club wound up its
season with a meet in Valleyfield Forest.
There was a big rally of members, and
the roads in the vicinity were thronged
with the cars of onlookers. The Reg
Taylors entertained the hunt at picnic
lunch. Mrs. A. E. Bennett holds the
record for attendance, not having missed
one meet. Her beloved mount V.C.
shares the honor.

Those Playing Tricks.
BY DR. H. L. TONKIN.
“It’s worse than going back to school
again,” said a contract learner to me one
day. “That honor-trick table was bad
enough, but when it comes to all this
addition and subtraction in order to
count up the playing tricks in a hand I
feel that it’s too much like hard work. 1 ’
Hundreds of beginners doubtless feel the
same way during their first few lessons.
However, for contract purposes, some-
thing was needed to replace the more or
less slipshod methods of valuation em-
ployed in auction bridge. It is not enough
to rely solely on experience, intuition and
“card sense” to estimate the trick-taking
powers of a hand. Hence the Culbertson
distributional count. It is remark-
ably accurate up to ten tricks, which
is all it claims, and, besides giving the
poorer player a chance to measure up
with the more expert, it trains the expert
in helpful methods of calculation.
The distributional count is the result
of observation and tabulation of suit dis-
tributions in thousands of hands. From
this a player is able to assess the number
of tricks his hand should make, unless
there is some abnormal arrangement of
the cards against him. Nor is it difficult
to master ; and, once mastered, it becomes
a matter of simple addition. If a player
calls one spade, he is placed with at least
2i honor tricks and four playing tricks.
If the hand opposite counts up to five
playing tricks with spades as trumps,
the partners have nine between them.
The correct response then is three spades.
When the opener holds no more values,
the bidding stops at this level, and, with
reasonably accurate play of the hand,
nine tricks are obtained. But keep in
mind that the hand must be played for
its maximum. It’s no use throwing away
one or more tricks in the play and then
blaming the distributional count.
And, after all, most hands require
only a little care and observation to pro-
duce the best results. It is only the
occasional deal which needs expert play
to bring home the bacon.
Overbidding Redeemed.
This week I watched a hand beautifully
played by Mr. H. Humphery at the
Sydney Bridge Club. His partner was
optimistic enough to overbid by at least
a trick. The final contract of six n.t.
should never have been bid, but it was
made, notwithstanding the best defence.
Here is the deal: —
North’s opening n.t. is quite fair, though
some may prefer one club. South’s force
with three clubs was evidently made to
discover whether his partner could bid
any four-card suit, particularly spades.
When the three n.t. response was forth-
coming, I thinjc that South should have
been content with that, and not, by call-
ing four n.t., have forced North to dis-
close the two remaining aces. It is clear
that they have a wealth of honor tricks,
but neither has been able to name an
honest suit, so that the slam would seem
foredoomed to failure.
The opening was the spade ten from
Hast, and, reviewing the dummy, Mr.
Humphery could see that two finesses and
a break in the club suit were all that
was required to get the contract.
The first trick being won with dummy’s
spade king and the club three led, West
played the ten, and North’s knave held.
The return of the deuce and South’s king
dropping on West’s queen made all too
clear. Even if the hearts are right 11
tricks seem the maximum. Declarer,
however, sees one possible chance. If
East holds the spade queen, and can be
stripped of the red suits, the contract can
be obtained.
A heart is led, and when the knave
wins North feels better. He knows that
East started with four clubs, and pro-
bably four spades, which would mean
only five cards in the red suits. The king
and queen of diamonds make, and the
spade eight is put through. It does not
matter whether East covers or not, the
king goes on. South’s ace of diamonds is
followed by another heart to North’s ten-
ace. The queen makes, and the lead of the
heart ace squeezes East. He can’t part •
with a club, so a spade goes, leaving him
with the bare queen and two clubs, nine
and six. North now plays a spade, stick-
ing East in, and forcing him to lead up
to the ace eight of clubs.
This is all very easy when looked at
afterwards, but Mr. Humphery deserves
credit, first for even seeking a way
out, and then for being clever enough
to carry his plan through.
Another deal, quite smartly handled
by a well-known player a week or so ago,
was the following. I am giving only
three hands, as East does not enter into
either bidding or play.
North has a bare raise over the infor-
matory double by West. Once North
gives this raise, South is quite justified
in bidding game, even though he knows
West holds three or four honor tricks.
In play, West makes his king and ace
of diamonds, the third round, of course,
being trumped by South. The position
is that, in addition to the two diamond
tricks, South must lose one club and
most likely a heart. As West made an
informatory as well as a business double,
he would seem to be definitely marked
with the heart king, so that the finesse
must lose.
This was where the player showed his
knowledge of the game, and took the
only chance of success. The play con-
sists of what is known as a “strip and
a stick-in.” South clears the trumps,
winning the second round in dummy, and
then ruffs North’s last diamond. Two
rounds of clubs are then won, the third
being lost, as hoped, to West. West is
now in a desperate position. If he leads
diamonds, declarer gets a ruff and a dis-
card, so he is forced to play a heart up
to the tenace. Actually, there are dozens
of missed opportunities for elimination
or “strip” play every week. It requires
accurate counting of the cards, so that
the opponent is cleared of unwanted
suits before being “stuck-in.” The de-
clarer, if he doesn’t hold the top card
to be put in, is no worse off than before,
and is just driven to take the finesse he
was trying to avoid. This elimination
play and the “squeeze” are the two chief
weapons in the expert’s armory.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
E.D. (Newcastle, N.S.W.). —I think you
were wrong to force on the hand given.
It is a good example of the type men-
tioned a week or so ago. Although it
contains 5| honor tricks, it has only 61-
playing tricks in its best suit, spades.
Therefore, partner needs what would
amount to a voluntary response in order
to furnish a game.
D.C. (Rose Bay, N.S.W.).—Many of
the best players are not slavish adher-
ents of any one system. They try to pick
the most helpful features from different
textbooks, and from them mould a
system of their own. This is not to be
recommended to the novice, however.

dient helps the absorption of body-
building, muscle and nerve-forming
food ingredients. It helps to expel
waste easily, thus avoiding the
dreaded evils of constipation.

Another Millennium.
BY PAWANG.
THE latest plans and specifications for
the Millennium come from the
fertile brain of Professor Marston
F. Bogert, of Columbia University,
U.S.A. Addressing the American Chemi-
cal Society, of which he was formerly
president, he announced that within two
or three generations chemists throughout
the world would be in possession of
secrets which would enable them to pro-
duce a synthetic superman.
The professor is a master of pictur-
esque language, and he put it this way.
There are in the human brain huge areas
—over half the total territory, according
to his computation—which are as un-
known, mysterious and undeveloped as
the jungle tracts of South America and
Darkest Africa. The chemist of the
future would invade this trackless coun-
try armed with hypodermic syringes, cap-
sules and other deadly weapons, and
would let in light in unimagined quanti-
ties.
He would fell the forest, cut the
country up for closer settlement and im-
port psychic agriculturists who would
turn it into a smiling garden. Hatred
would die in the human heart, the arma-
ments manufacturer would give up his
trade, the capitalist lion would lie down
with the proletarian lamb, the imperialist
would kiss the brows of subject peoples,
and the League of Nations would no
longer be necessary.
The future race would walk on phy-
sical and mental stilts, and intellectually
would be giants to such pygmies as
Bacon, Socrates and Schopenhauer. The
secret of perpetual youth would be every-
body’s prerogative. The man in the
street would be immune from inhibi-
tions, frustrations and complexes, and
automatically heir to that fire of genius
and the resthetic joy in living which have
hitherto only been toilsomely developed
by a few poets, artists and philosophers.
The alleged justification for the pro-
fessor’s dithyrambs is the discovery of
certain synthetic drugs which have a pro-
found effect on the human body and
personality. Some of these compounds,
whose formulae are longer than the Lord’s
Prayer and more complicated than Ein-
stein’s theory of relativity, have a most
evil effect, encouraging the partaker to
the darkest deeds and frenzies, but there
are others that build up the noblest spiri-
tual qualities.
It has long been known, of course,
that deficiency of certain chemicals in
the blood causes queer phenomena, such
as goitre, big-headedness, mental inertia
and homicidal impulses. The pituitary
gland, whose action is chemical, is now
known to control the function of sex,
bodily growth and mental development.
It. is, therefore, confidently assumed that
by interfering in the functions of these
glands by injection or operation you can
turn an individual into a Deeming or
into a Byron.
Taking the professor at his word,
therefore, we can assume that science will
one day be possessed of adequate ways
and means of creating a model member
of society. What then?
It is here, in my opinion, that Profes-
sor Bogert’s ship of hope runs hard and
fast aground on the rock of known and
observed human facts. We will sup-
pose that in the year 2000 the chemists
duly inform their respective Govern-
ments that they are now in a position
to supply any kind of human being
desired by said Governments. It is
a reasonable assumption that the Nazi
Government, if still in existence, would
unhesitatingly declare that the ideal
superman would be a Nazi. The Soviet
Government would plump for a Com-
munist. The Italian Government would
want a nation entirely composed of Mus-
solini Fascists. The Chinese Govern-
ment would no doubt order an unlimited
quantity of Confuciuses. The Australian
Government would naturally have a de-
bate on. the subject, come to no con-
clusion and decide to go to the country.
U.A.P. party managers would plaster
the land with posters descriptive of the
ideal Australian, who would no doubt
be a combination of Mr. Bruce, Mr.
Lyons, Jimmy Pike and Don Brad-
man. The A.L.P. would counter with a
design representing a class-conscious
unionist. The wowsers would offer for
the nation’s approval a cross between the
Rev. Judkins arid a perfect young lady
from the Y.W.C.T.U. Mr. Lang’s
nominee would have a large chin and a
gift for confused rhetoric. The Country
party favorite would be a wiregrass
superman ennobled by the stern struggle
with Nature. And there would be vari-
ous Independent supermen.
The party that won the election would
then proceed to inoculate everybody with
the appropriate serum or virus, and in
due course the entire population would
be supporters of the established order,
as represented by the Government.
Everybody would then be engaged in
taking in everybody else’s intellectual
washing. Since everybody would think
like everybody else, there would be no
necessity for thinking—after all, think-
ing only arises from one person’s desire
to overcome some other person’s oppo-
site opinion. The community would sink
into a state of general inertia, and to all
intents and purposes be indistinguishable
from morons, so that the odd individual
who had escaped being made into a
superman could seize power even on the
most meagre equipment of unusual
thinking.
As a matter of fact, several countries
are trying to arrive at Professor Bogert’s
millennium without the use of drugs or
glandular extracts. It has been found by
alert Governments that similar results can
be obtained more quickly by mental pro-
paganda. As a result of intensive injec-
tion of slogans, mottoes, maxims, bunk,
blither and reiterated nonsense per radio,
press, pulpit and cinema, most of the in-
habitants of Germany now see them-
selves as so many mirrors of Nazi chiv-
alry, courage and nobility. Russia is
almost entirely inhabited by Lenins. In
the United States millions are convinced
that they are participating in the Square
Deal, although many of them hardly
know where their next meal is coming
from.
Unfortunately for the aims and aspira-
tions of Governments, there are always
a few people in any generation who
are immune from the prevailing in-
fection. They are invariably regarded by
their fellow-citizens as persons of sinister
significance or no significance whatever,
so much so that Governments can usually
burn, torture, hang, exile, imprison or,
at least, gag them not only with impunity
but with the hearty approval of the
majority. If some of them escape to die
of old age or even to be honored, it is
not through goodwill but accident. They
are such men (or women) as Socrates,
Galileo, Joan of Arc, Rabelais and
Nietzsche —the list could be extended
considerably. If enough right-thinkers
became alarmed at his discovery, Pro-
fessor Bogert himself would be in grave
danger of being regarded as an obnoxious
person.
“Chevroford”: A new problem for the
Transport Board or the Health Commis-
sion, or whatever organisation concerns
itself with such things, is an enterprising
baker who sends a delivery-van round
a Melbourne suburb in the small hours.
Two smartly-uniformed attendants man
the vehicle, which is handsome in appear-
ance, and they deliver their commodity
in the usual fashion. What differentiates
this new portent from its fellows is a
stentorian voice calculated to lift the
average citizen out of his boots or bed
at 40 yards. It announces that a four-
pound loaf is sixpence, and that the
facility has been made possible by co-
operation with the Housewives’ organisa-
tion. No human thorax could produce
sales-talk in such volume without
mechanical assistance. There are a micro-
phone, an amplifier and a loudspeaker
hidden inside the vehicle.

The Fatal Theory.
BY FRANK WALFORD
££ r T I HERE are two scientific ways of
approaching the truth,” said the
Very Young Man—“the empirical
method and the postulatory method.”
Simpson, the famous criminal lawyer,
examined his fingernails. “What do you
mean by the ‘postulatory method’?” he
asked.
The Very Young Man sipped his claret
thoughtfully. “The formulation of a
theory, which you then set out to prove,
or maybe disprove.”
Johnstone laughed. “An obvious
method,” he declared, “but subject to one
big disability. The human mind is so
constituted that the framer of a theory
usually refuses to see anything against
it. Instead of the impartial observer he
becomes the advocate defending his
theory against the onslaughts of sceptics.”
“Only when his mind is ossified,” re-
torted the Very Young Man. “In any
case, the mere existence of his theory
provides opportunity for the unbiased to
discover the truth. His own attitude is
unimportant. Once the theory has been
lormulated it is there as a cockshy for
the world. He may defend it till the
crack of doom ; but if others reveal its
weaknesses it falls.”
“Some of the biggest rows on record
in scientific camps have arisen over
theories,” observed little Mullins, rolling
a cigarette and lighting it.
“Maybe,” agreed the Very Young
Man. “But you will admit that no harm
can come from a theory, whatever the
attitude of its supporters and attackers.
At worst it furnishes a battleground from
which the truth may emerge.”
“I’m not so sure that a theory is always
harmless,” criticised Simpson. “I knew
a man who was hanged by one of his pet
theories.”
“Hanged?” ejaculated the Very Young
Man sceptically.
“Exactly—hanged! He was innocent
of criminal intent. He was grossly care-
less, I admit; but his intentions were in
order, which is all the law requires.”
“How could a theory hang a man?”
asked the Very Young Man, glancing
round the table.
“The fact that it did should answer
that sufficiently,” replied Simpson evenly.
“Is it one of those dark secrets which
you lawyers hide in your memories, or
is it a subject for release?” asked
Mullins, who owned a private picture
theatre.
“Nothing secret about it,” said Simp-
son. “I defended the man and know
the details. When we undertake a case
the first thing we do is to get a
line on our client’s innocence or
guilt. The fiction is that we must not
defend a man who admits his guilt. Con-
sequently we never permit him to go
quite that far. But we get at it by, an
inverse process. If he is innocent we
want to know it; if he isn’t” —he
shrugged his shoulders —“well, we remain
ignorant of the fact.”
“And in this case he was innocent?”
suggested Johnstone.
“Quite innocent. I know that beyond
doubt. But his unfortunate theory sent
him to the gallows, all the same. He
died to vindicate it.”
“Not willingly?” ,
“The reverse. In all my experience
I have not met another who accepted a
verdict so badly. He whimpered like a
child.”
“Would it be unprofessional to tell us
the story?” asked Mullins.
Simpson drained his glass and laid his
cigar on the edge of his plate. “I am
speaking of a man named Welton who
was charged with murdering his wife
nearly twenty years ago. It all began
with his mania for theorising. He was a
whale on it. He had theories about the
universe, about government, about
finance, about domestic affairs and about
everything else that interested him. He
hearly drove his wife crazy. Their rela-
tions were the talk of the district. They
bickered incessantly.
“He first advanced his fatal theory at a
dinner party. For some reason the con-
versation had turned to murder. There
was general agreement that the actual
committing of a crime was simple. The
difficulty lay in disposing of the body.
“Welton pondered the problem while
the others were advancing bizarre
methods of hiding a corpse. Then he
looked up with an air of triumph, and
asked why it was necessary to dispose of
the body. This brought comment from
every side. How was the murderer t.
escape, they asked, if the body was lef
lying about?
“ ‘There is no need to conceal it,'
Welton persisted. ‘That is where the
average murderer slips. The art of the
thing is to accomplish it in such a waj
that the authorities will regard it as ars
accident.’
“In reply to sarcastic inquiries aboui
technique Welton let himself go. ‘I
wish to get rid of a man,’ he said. ‘Very
well. 1 invite him to dinner, taking care
that there are reputable witnesses present.
1 turn the conversation to firearms. Ther
1 go to my room, get a revolver, bring
it. to the table and shoot him openh
before the whole company—accidentally
of course. I rave and tear my hair. I
curse my clumsiness. The coroner reads
me a long lecture about the folly of play-
ing with firearms, and the public regard
me as a lunatic. But 1 go scot-free.’
“ ‘Suppose it didn’t come off?’ de
murred one of his listeners. ‘What I
mean is, what if a jury did not regard it
as an accident?’
“ ‘Look here,’ replied Welton ; ‘if yo
passed my house at two in the morning
and saw a man at work picking the
lock you’d run to the police station,
wouldn’t you?’
“The critic said he would.
“ ‘Of course you would. But if you
passed at two in the afternoon and saw
the same man engaged in the same
task you’d take no notice. It would
never occur to you that a burglar would
choose daylight to enter a house in a
busy street. It’s just the same with
murder. If it is done openly, with the
whole world looking on, no one imagines
it anything but an accident. Hold you)
candle to the sun, and its flame is los:
against the dazzling background.’ ”
Simpson paused and lifted his cigar.
Finding that it had gone out he tossed
it into an ashtray. “That was Welton’s
fatal theory,” he said reflectively.
“A sound one, too,” commented the
Very Young Man.
“Quite sound,” agreed Simpson. “So
sound that it sent him to the gallows.”
“How?” asked Mullins.
“I have told you,” Simpson proceeded,
“that relations between himself and his
wife were strained, which fact was fairly
widely known. Well, the day came when
Welton really bought a revolver. There
had been a lot of burglary in the neigh-
borhood, and he freely advertised his
intention of protecting his home since
the police seemed unable to do it.”
“He was quite right,” observed the
Very Young Man.
“Quite right,” assented Simpson
gravely, “but unlucky. The sequel
occurred at another little dinner party in
his own home. He had been holding
forth about his defence proposals and
he brought the revolver to the table.
It had the customary double-action ; that
is, there was no need to cock it. Press-
ing the trigger did all that was necessary,
the hammer rising and falling automati-
cally.
“I’m confident that Welton had not the
remotest idea how it happened. He was
waving the weapon round, explaining
what he would do to a burglar, when
his brother-in-law asked him not to point
it at him.
“‘A gun is only dangerous in the
hands of a fool,’ Welton said.
“ ‘Perhaps,’ said his brother-in-law ;
‘but I don’t want the damned thing
pointed at me. Turn it away.’
“Welton obeyed. He was not clear
about it; but I can imagine a muzzle
sweeping in a wide circle and nutating
like the axis of the earth. All he knew
was that suddenly the silence was broken
by the crash of the weapon, and his wife
slipped forward on the table with blood
welling from her forehead. He re-
membered staring at a wisp of smoke
issuing from the barrel and curling up-
ward.
“Then the women screamed, and the
men crowded round the victim. One
lifted her head and called her by name.
Another dashed to the telephone and
rang a doctor.
“Welton, shocked to the core, ran true
to form. He unconsciously enacted the
role described with such unfortunate
minuteness in his theory of murder. He
raved. He wept. He cursed himself for a
clumsy fool. In the end he worked him-
self into a state of hysteria which caused
the doctor to give him an injection of
some derivative of barbatone. Under
its hypnotic influence he was carried to
bed, where he slept for hours.

“Those who remembered his theory of
murder were suspicious. They also ran
true to form by passing on their suspicions
to the police. Men almost invariably
do that. There is something in human
nature that delights in a man-hunt. The
neighbors did their bit by enlarging on
his unhappy relations with his wife. The
upshot was his arrest and the forging o
a chain of evidence which I found im-
possible to break. . ‘
“The coroner sent him for trial. The
jury brought him in guilty alter less than
an hour’s retirement.
“Knowing the poor wretch was guilt-
less of anything worse than stupid care-
lessness, 1 fought hard for his repneVe.
Lawyers are not as callous as they are
represented to be. Behind our efforts to
get a man acquitted, or get him con-
demned, is normal human feeling. We
don’t differ much from other men; we
merely grow sophisticated.
“I always regarded you chaps as
fairly sophisticated,” concurred Mullins
with a slow nod, “but l did not suspect
you of human feeling.” ?
“Nevertheless, we have it, Simpson
insisted. “Cabinet considered Welton’s
case at great length and decided to let
the law take its course. The police
had done their work too well. Be-
sides, the press had inflamed the public
mind, and votes had to be considered.
An election was only two months off,
That particular aspect was put to me con-
fidentially by the deputy-leader of the
Government.”
“Do you mean to tell us that such
things are placed in the balance against
a human life?” asked the Very Young
Man, horrified.
Simpson shrugged his shoulders.
“So Welton was hanged?” asked John-
stone.
“He was hanged,” said Simpson
“hanged because his unlucky theory
chanced to coincide with fact.”
The Very Young Man scratched his
cheek thoughtfully. “It is an interest-
ing case,” he observed ; “but what has
it to do with the scientific aspect of
formulating a theory?”
Simpson laughed. “Nothing at all.
It’s just a warning to inventors ol
theories to confine them to generalities.
Don’t make them personally specific. If
you follow that rule you may theorise
in safety till the cows come home.”
Too Much Smith.
BY HAROLD MERCER.
MUDVILLE is a suburb just large
enough to have a number of
Smiths, including several William
Smiths. The one who matters had what
is vaguely known as “a business in town.
Some time in the remote past he had
thrown a desk and chair into a cheap
office, screwed to the door a plate with
“W. Smith, Agent,” on it, and pre-
pared to do business. The effluxion of
time had added some sundries and piles
of untidy, dusty papers to the office ; but
he remained anything but affluent, and
tradespeople in Mudville had not re-
covered from their early suspicions.
But one Monday morning things
changed. Smith was preparing to put off
the payment of the milkman’s account,
when the distributor of cow-juice dashed
towards the gate. “Oh, it doesn’t matter,
Mr. Smith ; it’ll do at the end of the
month,” he said smilingly.
The butcher arrived a few minutes
later. He usually collected cash on
delivery; but this morning he remarked
that a monthly account might be more
convenient.
Glowing with satisfaction at these evi-
dences of local appreciation, Smith was
setting out for the city when Robb-Jones,
who called a Ford “my car,” hailed him
and insisted upon driving him into town,
and then pressed him to have a morn-
ing whisky. No great pressing was
needed.
“But I’ll have to return it some other
time,” said Smith, who had left with his
wife the money the butcher might have
taken. “Fact is, until I get to the
bank”
Robb-Jones dived for his pocket-book.
“Will you allow me?” he said. “We’re
neighbors; it’ll be an hour before the
banks open.”
Smith, amazed, took a dignified atti-
tude.
“No—really!” he said. “I make it a
point not to borrow money.”
“But I insist” said Robb-Jones. “I’ll
be offended if you refuse.”
“Well, if you put it that way”
said Smith.
As a matter of fact Robb-Jones had
only discovered that morning that he was
a neighbor. Hitherto he had been aloof.
All this was merely prelude to a
day of delightful surprises. People
who usually passed Smith with curt nods
invited him to drink with them; what
had been strictly cash transactions were
put on a credit basis ; and in the new
friendliness of the world business was
rushed upon him.
When he reached home he found his
wife almost hysterical.
“It’s been a wonderful day,” she
said. “All the tradespeople are oblig-
ing, and trying to force credit on me.
Then Mrs. Barr and Mrs. Catts called
upon me —oh, there’s been a heap
of callers! People who never seemed
to know we existed before. I had to
send round for cakes and things—you
must give people something to eat ; and
the woman in the cakeshop told Mildred
‘You’d better let me book it.’ ”
“Amazing!” gasped Smith. “Some-
thing of the same sort has been happen-
ing to me.”
“Do you know what it is?” demanded
Mrs. Smith. “They think we’ve won the
State lottery. The name was put in the
papers as William Smith, of Mudville ;
and they think it’s us!”
William stared. He had laid it down
that they had no money to waste in lot-
teries ; and so they had been quite un-
interested in the results. He saw daylight
now. There was that conversation with
Robb-Jones, for instance.
“I’ve got to congratulate you on your
good luck,” Robb-Jones had said.
Smith, trying hard to remember some
luck, thought of his election to the com-
mittee of a branch of the Oddfellows.
“I went very near it once before,” he
replied cheerfully. “It’s nice to know
of the good you can do ; and it’s useful,
in a way, in the business.”
“I think I’d celebrate it by taking a
holiday,” Robb-Jones had said. At the
time Smith had thought that was
carrying matters a bit too far. Now he
realised that Robb-Jones —and others—
were thinking of something not in his
own thoughts.
“Well, let them go on thinking it,”
said William to his wife energetically.
“We’ve had a pretty rough spin all
told. Let them find out for themselves!
We’re not deceiving them ; they’re deceiv-
ing themselves.”
“Oh, I’m not going to undeceive them,”
said Mrs. Smith.
But such a deception could not last
long. The real William Smith, who had
been away, and whose frequent absences
prevented his being well known, returned
in haste and went on a “bender” at the
local hotels. The news spread quickly.
It always does in Mudville.
On his way home Smith encountered
the grocer outside his shop. The grocer’s
recently pleasant greeting was absent.
“What about your account, Mr.'
Smith?” he asked.
“My account? It’s not the first of the*
month.”
“All the same, I’d like a settlement.
My terms are cash or, at most, weekly
payments.”
Smith entered the shop and snapped,
open a chequebook. “You suggested
yourself the monthly account: I prefer
weekly payments myself.”
Smith used his chequebook convinc-
ingly where he encountered a similar
attitude. Robb-Jones became almost,
friendly again when his debt was paid:
For Smith had benefited substantially
from the few days of misunderstanding..
In the city it was still suspected that he
had a financial backing of £5OOO. , ,
Mudville, however, regarded Smith
as a man who had deceived it. He might
be able to pay his way, but he was a,
shifty customer. It had been thought
that he had won the lottery and he had
not; could evidence be more conclusive?
Mudville was prepared to think him
capable of anything. The many things
that happen to William Smiths, as re-
ported in the papers, were all attributefl
to him. If his improving business kept
him away from home for a day or so:
William Smith was either in gaol or had
absconded with funds or eloped wi
another woman or had become intoxi-
cated and been run over by a tram.

Smith found himself regarded darkly
as a man out on bail for shop-breaking
or as having been fined for drunk and
disorderly or for being at a two-up
school. Naturally, these suspicions
pained him. His wife also was pained,
especially when she received condolences
about her husband’s death following the
announcement in the press that William
Smith, aged 35, had been run over by
a car whilst under the influence of liquor.
The crisis came when a paragraph
appeared in the afternoon paper subse-
quent to Smith’s departure on a business
trip:
A sensation was caused on the Newcastle
steamer last night by the arrest of a pas-
senger who, with a lady, had booked for
the northern port. The charge is one of
embezzlement, heavy defalcations being
alleged... .The police believe that the
intention was to proceed from Newcastle to
Brisbane, and thence north....A man said
to be the husband of the woman accom-
panied the police
Underneath, separated by the simple sub-
heading “Man Charged,” appeared:
William Smith. 42, agent, was this
morning brought before the Central Court
on warrant
It was Mudville’s biggest sensation.
Mrs. Smith was verging on hysteria
when Smith, having returned unsuspect-
ingly by train from Newcastle, came
back.
“You! You’re out on bail! And you
dare come here after you”
“What’s the matter?” demanded the
astonished William,
...
, O-o-oh, you ber-rute! screamed Mrs.
‘ ,
Her ,ord dlved under the table just in
time to avoid a well-flung vase.
The situation took a lot of explaining,
especially as Smith didn’t know, at once,
what to explain. He had to dodge around
furniture to escape flying missiles. But
dlc a *l" was cleared.
Smith became Jewel-Smith shortly
after that. The first name was a pet
name his father had given his mother;
, •. •. r • , , , , ’
dad salt! it was the only jewel he had to
hei.
Before long they moved from Mud-
vi!le - and the y did not acquaint Mudville
with their new address.
c , ... , , ,
. Mudville "ever suspected that the
W,lliara Smith who won first prize in
the lottery a couple of months later was
the Smith it had neglected, and flattered.
and rejected. A new-found belief in his
star, inspired by his Mudville experiences,
had turned out luckily for William.
The Monopoly-Breaker.
BY J. BREMNER.
rHE township basked in the morning
sunshine after a night-long bath in
heavy rain. Two sleek cows plodded
unconcernedly between the pub and the
general store, turning into the well-
grassed side road at the post-office
corner.
A youngish, thick-set man watched
them from the verandah of the Criterion.
It was his third day in the place—his
third day of standing idly under that ver-
andah in his plum-colored suit, smoking
“tailor-mades” and feeling bored. The
cows out of sight, his gaze returned to
the dilapidated wooden building opposite,
with its narrow doorway between win-
dows gleaming with aluminium and tin-
ware, and “J. Criss, Storekeeper,” almost
obliterated from the hoarding above the
verandah.
To-day, he noted, the township was
much busier than it had been since his
arrival. Farmers were flocking in—in
sulkies, in cars and on horseback, dogs
following— to tell each other what a good
thing it had rained, what a good season it
had been, and what heaps of feed there
would be for the winter. Horses were
being hitched to the barbed wire by the
blacksmith’s now, all the fenceposts hav-
ing been taken up quite early ; and still
they were coming.
Criss’s store was doing a roaring trade.
Customers who on ordinary days might
come out laden with parcels within half
an hour of entering the main door to-
day were kept an hour, so great was
the rush. On emerging, the womenfolk
would drift about from the post office
to the fruitshop and restaurant, known
as “The Dago’s,” then back again to
Criss’s or the vehicles they came in to
make sure they had everything. Not so
the men. The few teetotallers went
straight home. The majority gathered in
the bar of the Criterion, where the only
woman about was the barmaid. There
they could talk with freedom about the
price of butter, last night’s rain, each
other’s dogs and other vital matters.
As each farmer entered the pub the
youngish man under the verandah care-
fully sized him up. “Cow-cockies all,”
he thought bitterly, They’d never
gamble; he knew that. He had been
told that three strangers had visited
the place in quick succession in the past
few weeks. The first and second fleeced
such of the locals as considered them-
selves card players; the third emptied
the pockets of a reputed champion, the
relieving postmaster. In short, they had
“cruelled it on him”—made the hayseeds
windy.
He was now nearly broke. Only five
bob in his pocket, and he owed for two
days’ board and lodging. That was no-
thing ; it wouldn’t be hard to do a quiet
get if the day brought in no mugs.
He would pay the publican if he could ;
it was his policy to pay his debts when-
ever he was able. But how could one
pay when one was broke?
As he regarded Criss’s store he could
not help reflecting what a goldmine the
place must be. A monopoly of the
business in the district, old Criss had
and with his high charges for goods he
must be making a fortune. If a man
could only start a cash-and-carry he’d
get most of the trade! Well, not a cash-
and-carry, perhaps, but a cheap store:
big turnover, small profits, quick re-
turns! That was the way to make
money! Out of date, old Criss was!
It was only a short mental step for
Danty, who had served three years in
a Sydney suburban grocery, and thought
he knew all there was to know in that
trade, to imagine himself setting up as
a rival. There was a small shop-building,
evidently closed, up the road just be-
yond the post office. “That joint’d do,”
he reflected.
He strolled over to examine it. Cur-
tains were drawn across the windows ; it
was obviously being used as a dwelling.
A man came out of the door ; a dried-
up, pallid fellow with a small moustache
and sagging lips. Syd had yarned with
him, and had classified him as a species
of booze-artist.
“So you live here, eh?” Danty in-
quired.
“Yairs. Lived ’ere five year now.”
“Why ain’t y’ keepin’ a shop? Ought
t’ be good money in a cash-and-carry
in a town like this.”
“Y’ gotter be a moneyed man t’ start.
That’s w’y!”
“The joint belong t’ you?”
“Me and a bloke called Ken Jack-
son y’ might remember ’im gettin’
drownded in Sydney a coupla years back
Fine feller, too! Shout? He’d shout
till”
Syd did not want to hear details.
“Do y’ own it?” he interrupted.
The other scented business. “Yairs. I
do,” he declared.
“Ever use ’er fer a shop?”
“As I was gonner say, me an’ Ken
Jackson builds it, an’ I starts in the ’air-
dressin’. I done all right fer a w’ile, but
there’s too many amachoors cuttin’’ fer
nothink, an’ the people round ’ere is the
most hidebound push outside o’ ’ell!
Too lousy t’ pay a man wot’s ’elpin'
their town along a measly one and six!
They goes an’ gets it cut fer nothink ; and
y’ want t’ see some o’ the cuts they
gets!” The ex-barber burst into derisive
laughter.
“Then you are the owner of this
place?” Danty asked again.
“Seein’ as ’ow Ken Jackson an’ I
builds it, an’ I supplies the timber, an'
pays a deposit on the ground, an’ gives
’im a tenner fer ’elpin’ a man, I ought t'
own it. W’y?”
“Might see y’ this evenin’,” Syd said.
Leaving the other mystified and with
vague regrets at having betrayed his
ownership, he returned to his room in
the pub, where he remained some minutes
thinking out his scheme. He judged the
ex-barber as one not above making a
few pounds by doubtful means as long
as there was no risk to himself. Nobody
knew him, nor what he was doing in the
town.
He went down to the bar, where,
shouting one of the gossipy sort a whisky!
he mentioned confidentially that he was"
seriously considering starting another
store. An up-to-date one. Small profits
and quick returns.

Dinner-time came. Danty took the
vacant seat at a table where three farmers
were seated. To them he repeated the
tale he had told the gossipy man, and
added to it.
All thought it would be an excellent
idea. The town was sure to grow. The
main highway would make it prosper,
and this would be completed in about
twelve months ; then a new era would
commence.
They shouted for him after the mid-
day meal, drinking to the prosperity of
the new store.
Syd strolled over to Parker’s —Parker,
he had been told, was the ex-barber's
name —and brought him back to the
upstairs private parlor.
“Look here, Parker,” he said after the
first drink, “would y’ like t’ have a tenner
in y’ hand to-night? Dinkum money—
no thievin’ or nothin’ underhand ; and
no risk. I knew as soon as I first seen
y’ you was a sportsman, and game.”
“I’m on fer a tenner ; but how am 1
goin’ t’ get it?”
“I’ll tell y’ how t’ make fifty in an
hour. That’s worth a half-share fer me,
ain’t it?”
“Well, ’ow?” Parker was not the sort
of man who would easily agree to any-
thing.
“You’ve heard, ain’t y’, I’m goin’ t’
start a new shop in this town?”
“The missus was just sayin’ she’d ’eard
somethink like it w’en y’ come along this
evenin’.”
“The whole town knows about it
now,” said Danty. “I told ’em a couple
of hours ago. It don't take a thing long
t’ get round a place like this.”
“ ’Ow is she fer a job?”
“I’m cornin’ t’ that. Now, old Criss
will have heard by now about the cash-
store, you can bet on that! And he’ll
have the wind up, ’cos he knows it’s goin’
t' take away half his trade. It’s worth
money t’ him t’ keep the new shop out
of the town, ain’t it?”
Parker nodded.
“Now, what you do is this. You go
into the shop gettin’ near closin’ time
and have a yarn with old Criss. Tell
him I made y’ a fair offer t’ rent that
buildin’ o’ yours, and first chance of a
job when I put a man on. Nothin'
wrong in that, is there?”
“Don’t look t’ be nothink wrong.”
“Then y’ tells old Criss how y’ don’t
like t’ see opposition cornin’ in, knowin'
him so long and him always bein’ honest
and fair and ready t’ let y’ have a bit
of credit when you’re hard up. Soft-
soap him up pretty good, see? And
when y’ got him well soaped up, tell
him y’ tips I ain’t got too much capital,
and don’t want t’ risk too much buildin’
a new store and that, ’cos I might find
business no good. W’y 1 want y’ shop
is t’ give the town a good try-out. If 1
don’t get y’ shop y’ knows fer a fact 1
won’t start up, see? And if he makes it
worth y’ while, say forty or fifty quid,
y’ won’t let me have the shop, see?”
Parker saw.
The sun was dipping behind the hills.
Danty, on the upstairs verandah of the
Criterion, was in good spirits, though
the drinks had reduced his capital to a
shilling. His attention was divided be-
tween watching the shop over the road
for Parker’s appearance and listening to
a pally commercial traveller, who had
arrived in his car only an hour ago, on
the subject of pickles and sauces.
Parker came out into the street and,
as arranged, went slowly round the post-
office, corner and up the side road.
Danty followed.
“Well, how did y’ get on?” he asked'
abruptly.
“Orright!” Parker said—nervously, ;
Danty thought.
“How much?”
“Thirty-eight-pound nine.”
“Hell!” Syd exclaimed delightedly,
“you must have haggled some!”
“Haggled like hell!”
Parker stopped walking. He turned,
and gazed uneasily towards the corner.
Syd looked that way, too. The local
policeman was standing there, looking
their way.
“Did he give y’ cash?” Syd asked.
“No.”
“What, a cheque?”
“It’s this way,” Parker slowly said. I
’ad a bill o’ thirty-eight pound nine run
up at the store. I done me best t’ get
cash out o’ ’im, but ’e wouldn’t come at
it. In the end ’e reckoned ’e’d write off
me debt”
“Where the hell do 1 come in?”
“I’m a poor man,” said Parker, “I got
nothink. But ’ere’s five bob”
Danty would have struck him, but the
policeman was still on the corner and
still looking their way ; and Danty knew
the value of self-control.
Mary and Elizabeth.
You were her prisoner
So many dreary years:
A flower bright and gay within the tower
Of misery; your haunting beauty lost;
Your merry heart and nimbleness of wit
Laid waste for. England’s sake.
Or was it England’s sake?
Or was it just the clash
Of rival queens to win a gilded throne?
We cannot judge you now —
Mary . . . Elizabeth.
But we do know
The victor lives with cruelty ajar;
Her infamies, her fame as brothers arc.
We know she dyed her hair: a harridan
Who owned no loyalty to any man.
We know the vanquished as a living grace,
Lovely and gentle, with a velvet rose
Of love within her heart: a lily’s face—
And more than that no man or woman knows.
QUEENSLAND.
LLYWELYN LUCAS.
Rondeau.
“Don’t! Stop!” she cried in keen distress.
A gentleman could do no less
Than prudently refrain, obey
(Although it turned blue skies to grey),
And strive contritely to express
By spoken word love’s sweet excess;
To win, perhaps, reluctant “Yes”
O’erriding that forbidding “Nay!
Don’t! Stop!”
Yet how shall mind of man assess
A woman’s will, her art, finesse?
Ere yet the echoes died away
There came a whisper clear as day
Borne on surrender’s soft caress:
“Don’t stop!”

BILL O'C.
Approach.
How dark it was! But out there the lagoon
Among the rushes must have mirrored stars.
Lost behind ragged scrub the little moon
Pent by the blackness of the coolibars.
Somewhere a dog barked; once I heard the
call u ,
Of young lambs. Then the silence smothered
all . . :
There was a yucca-tree In creamy bloom
And sotne small trailing vine that smelled so
sweet,
And blacker than the garden was the room.
But suddenly she came, with naked feet.
1 could not see her in the still hot night :
But all my body felt her warmth and light.

Brown sailor on the sea,

He only hears the wind-song.
The screaming shrouds, the hiss
Of curdled waters striking
The keel —he does not miss
The blackbirds singing, singing.
Through noons of tranced bliss.
He knows not that the almonds
Are past their prime, nor knows
What wind puts out the candles
Of the pollened pines, and blows
The little twinkling lanterns
On every twining rose.
For him the torn kelp drifting
Bereft of bloom and bud,
The slimy sea-roots sucking
Down into depths of mud,
And the ghostly fog-flowers forming
From out the flying scud.
For him no honeyed perfumes,
But the tang of salted shag,
• The. knife-wind. at, his breastbones,
’ And the .clank of chains that drag,
And' the- hungry gannets calling
. From cliff and castled crag.
Turn homeward, laughing sailor,

Where the filmy 'spring’s enchantment,

Falfers along , the, borders
Of the timeless, changeless sea!

Practical Men and Women
PELMANISM is concerned with personal attributes and quali-
ties, which are fundamental. They may be sleeping or only
partly developed, but they are in every normal individual.
Pelmanism develops them, separately and together, so that amongst
other things concentration is made easier by quickened perceptions ;
natural energy enormously increased by interest, and prompt
decision justified by soundness of judgment.
Amongst these attributes and qualities are:
Concentration
Judgment
Decbion
Will-Power
Initiative
Self-Confidence
Presence of Mind
Organising Power
a Reliable Memory.
The development of these strong, positive, vital qualities contributes
to one’s earning capacity, and makes it possible to live intelligently
in the present and build strongly for the future.
The People Who Take the
Pelman Course
There is only one kind of man who takes the Pelman Course,
but he is found in every calling and in every walk of life. He is
the man who wants to excel, who will not be deterred by circum-
stances, who will live intelligently and strongly, the man who will
reach out and share in the good things that every age and every
occupation offer to him who has the ability and courage to
take them.
AN ACCOUNTANT states that Pel-
manism has shown him “how to
overcome that paralysing feeling
of inferiority.”.
A FARMER writes: “I took up the
course to overcome a reserved
nature, which precluded me from
taking part in discussions of policy
and in debates. I have achieved
this object. Also, I find myself
rapidly acquiring a larger circle of
friends.”
AN ENGINEER WRITES: “I am
amazed at the manner in which
these printed Lessons time and
again hit upon, and deal with, my
own personal and particular prob-
lems.”
A COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER
writes: “It may interest you to
know that my figures for the first
quarter this year show an increase
of 30 per cent.”
A WOMAN CLERK writes: “1 can
concentrate for quite a long period
without my mind wandering. I
observe things far more quickly,
and have ever so much more confi-
dence in myself and my abilities.”
A TEACHER writes: “This Course
lias had a remarkable effect on my
physical and mental health. What
pleases me most is the certainty
that I have lost my fear. My
Self-confidence has returned, and
my whole outlook on life seems
to be reconstructed.”
A BANK CLERK writes: “This
Course has enabled me to see
clearly what I want in life and
how to get it. It has taken me out
of the rut.”
Thousands of similar letters from all
over Australia and New Zealand
could be printed did space permit.
“pELMANISM,”
says Dame
Sybil Thorndike,
“gives mind-exercise
scientifically. It not
only improves, but
actually discovers,
qualities that would
otherwise have re-
in a i ned dormant.
Pelmnnism gives a
mental clarity and
alertness that sees
opportunities an d
uses them rightly.”

“Pelmanism,” says
Lord Riddell, “Is
rapidly becoming
part and parcel of
our daily lives."
Lord Riddell did
splendid work for
England at the
Peace Conference.
His War Diary ex-
cited great interest
“Pelmanism,” D r.
Norwood, of the
City Temple, Lon-
don, says, “is sound
Psychology and an
admirable system of
Mind-training. Pel-
manism teaches that
man has the key to
his own career and
enables many to
find the key itself
which, for want of
self-knowledge, had
lain undiscovered.”

“Psalmist of the Dawn
By MARY MARLOWE.
There are few settings left in the world
that some novelist or other has not used,
but for this charming romance Miss
Marlowe has found one of them. Her
story, from the bustle and feverishness
of city life, moves quickly to Lord Howe
Island, palm-crested speck in the Pacific
which is a romance in itself. Miss Mar-
lowe knows her islanders intimately:
remote from the world’s hurly-burly;
characteristically ruled over by Three Wise
Men; altogether about the happiest people
on earth. The real and yet almost fairy-
tale island atmosphere gives the novel a
refreshing distinction, a compelling touch
of difference.
“Psalmist of the Dawn/’ by Mary Marlowe, is now on sale at
all bookstalls and newsagents. Published by The Endeavour
Press, 252 George Street, Sydney.
An Endeavour Press Book,
Price 4f6 (postage 3d.).

The operator at Sydney Radio Station, earphones on head, typewriter
at hand, immediately taps the Morse key in front of him, sending out
the ship's call sign and the letter "K" (Go ahead).
♦
Traffic from and to the particular ship is then
cleared. Other ships’ stations call VIS and the process
is repeated. Twenty-four hours a day messages are
received by Sydney Radio from ships in the Pacific,
Indian and Atlantic Oceans.
The broadcasting of official time signals, meteoro-
logical bulletins, storm warnings and other navigation
messages, are a few of the many wireless facilities
available to navigators to-day. A regular press news
service is nightly transmitted to ships at sea.
Amalgamated Wireless operates nineteen coastal
radio stations in Australia, handling approximately
