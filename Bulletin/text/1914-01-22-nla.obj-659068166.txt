This report from the Government Laboratory is undoubted proof of the value of “MUSTDIE” for
the destruction of insects.
CAUTION. —“MUSTDIE” must not be mistaken for insecticide or common insect powders some of
which are sold under fancy names, for “MUSTD r E” contains an ingredient particularly fatal to the

The Minimum Poet
The Red Pape
There are four classes of poets: the poet,
the r.inor poet, the minimum poet and the
minus poet. Few examples of the minus
poet are ever seen, save in the “Answers to
Correspondents” column. But the minimum
poet is distressingly frequent: he, or more
usually she, breaks out in pretty little book-
lets, especially at this season of the year.
Thus C. R. Moore, in Linnet Songs (Mount
Hope, N.S.W. —no publisher stated) knows
how to put words together in metre, but his
words have nothing to say, except, maybe, in
some nice girl’s autograph album. * Rose,
for instance, might blush at this tribute:—
Your eyes are delphinium blue,
Your cheeks are geranium red,
Like a creamy eschscholtzia your skin
And, golden straw sunshine your head. ’
You’re the daisiest flower of them all
The spiciest blossom that blows, ’
And the fairies that came to your birth,
What name could they give you but Rose ?
£chsch&a 0 ? Uldn,t She haVG been christened
And Philip Norman, in A Snrig of Wattle,
and O.F. (Penfold, Sydney), has but this
or interest to remark of his sprig:—
Fairest symbol of my country;
Fairest plant on Austral’s moor;
While love lasteth I will love thee:
Thee I’ll love, or love no more!
Christ tbUS be k eg * ns a minimum poem on
Good old Christmas is here once again,
And we crown him as king of the year.
Not with snow, nor with ice, nor with rain
Does he come ip this bright southern sphere:
But the warmth of his heart, it is plain,
Is expressed by the temperature. ...
Words! Words!
n Wallis Sugden’s Remembrance and
«Vni Ge^rs e Robertson, Melb.), sings thus
or lhe Circular Saws” :
Titanic the labors that tear
The heart from the primeval bush—
Steam power, horse power, and men
With brains and with sinews at push
She also writes “Lines to Lady Barron,
welcoming her as Patroness of the Writers’
Club, Hobart” :
And since good wishes are by nature prayers,
We pray that God may ever guide and bless,
In Council and in State, in hearth and home,
Our gracious and beloved patroness.
There is no reason why she shouldn’t have
wntten these lines, but no one but a minimum
poet would have dared to republish them.
Also, she writes various hymns and other
devotional verses —with not one suggestion
of inspiration in the lot-
Maggots
J. H. If abre, the most celebrated natural-
ist of our times, writes engagingly upon the
insect world—that strange, unhuman under-
world, where the sickening cruelty of Nature
rages unchecked and unheeded; but his pen
becomes rapturous when he deals with mag-
gots, For Fabre loves maggots. The Life
of the Fly, translated by A. T. Mattos
(Hodder and Stoughton, per Dymock’s Li-
brary, Sydney), the second volume of the
authorised edition of the works of J
Henri Fabre, is full of maggots. En-
chanting little beggars they are, too,
and with highly specialised and impor-
tant work to do for the world. The
larva of the Anthrax fly, for instance, does
not chew its food —-another grub—as do the
other carnivorous grubs ; it does not eat, it
inhales. As Fabre delectably exclaims, “Its
attack is a mere kiss ; but what a perfidious
kiss!” And most maggots of the numerous
species of the fly have the valuable power of
liquefying the dead flesh they attack. With-
out this marvellous resource of converting
their food into a digestible liquid, dead flesh
would merely dry up like a mummy. Pro-
tect a dead bird from the access of flies, and
that corps? would merely mummify.
In the hope of awakening us to a proper
sense of our insignificance, pulpit orators
sometimes make an unfair use of the grave
and its worms. Let us put no faith in their
doleful rhetoric. The chemistry of man’s
final dissolution is eloquent enough of our
emptiness; there is no need to add imaginary
horrors. The worm of the sepulchre is an
invention of cantankerous minds, incapable
of seeing things as they are. Covered by
but a few inches of earth, the dead can
sleep their quiet sleep: no fly will ever come
to take advantage of them.
At the surface of the soil, exposed to the
air, the hideous invasion is possible; ay. it
is the invariable rule. For the meiting
down and remoulding of matter, man is no
better, corpse for corpse, than the lowest
of the brutes. Then the fly exercises her
rights and deals with us as she does with
any ordinary animal refuse. Nature treats
us with piagnificent indifference in her great
regenerating-factory: placed in her crucibles,
animals and men, beggars and kings are
one and all alike. There you have true
equality, the only equality in this world of
ours: equality in the presence of the mag-
got.
“The maggot is the primary cause of
dissolution after death ; it is, above all, the
putrefactive chemist.” But there are simple
ways to elude the bluebottle’s cheerful habit
of laying her eggs in our meat. She refuses
to lay her eggs on the thinnest paper cover-
ing ; therefore from Fabre’s investigations
we get the useful hint that the best way to
preserve our meat from the fly—and also
our furs from the moth that corrupts and
gnashes his teeth —is to place each article
within a sealed paper bag.
Interspersed between the chapters in which
this incomparable observer explores this
dreadful underworld are chapters of Fabre’s
autobiography that possess an equal inter-
est. He tells us, in his captivatingly naive
prose, of his youth of poverty, his lack of
schooling, the expedients he resorted to to
acquire knowledge. When he was a poor
under-teacher at a school he taught himself
algebra—by the heroic expedient of teaching
another young man. When the pupil asked
him to teach him algebra Fabre, with all the
fine confidence of his 20 years, refrained
from exposing his own utter ignorance.
An heroic method of learning to swim is
to leap boldly into the sea. Let us hurl
ourselves head first into the algebraical
gulf; and perhaps the imminent danger of
drowning will call forth efforts capable of
bringing me to land. I know nothing of
what he wants. It makes no difference:
let’s go ahead and plunge into the mystery.
I shall learn by teaching.
But he had no book on algebra, nor could
he afford to buy one. A request for the
loan of such a work from his mathematical
colleague would expose him to that poten-
tate’s high ridicule. Fabre simply stole the
book from that teacher. The first chapter
that interested him was headed, “Newton’s
Binomial Theorem.” To Fabre’s astonish-
ment he found that he understood it; and
the rest of algebra looked like plain sailing.
But: “I was to recover from the illusion
later, when the binomial theorem, that light,
crisp biscuit, was followed by heavier and
less digestible fare.” But he learnt algebra
—and his pupil had never a suspicion that
his master was a fellow pupil.
_ln fact, Fabre received in the course of
his life only two lessons of a scientific char-
acter, one in anatomy—the dissecting of a
snail—and one in chemistry, in which the
class was blown up. And he learned chem-
istry by the means that had enabled him to
master algebra: he taught himself by teach-
ing others.
These fragments of autobiography indicate
that when the whole story of his life is
published in English the world will have the
most interesting, the quaintest, the most
modest, the most genially humorous of
viodern autobiographies.

. The allegory is a rare plant in Australian
literature; but for those who like little alleg-
ories with neat littlq mbrals tied to their
dear little curly tails, here is The Manic
Shadow Show, by Olga F. A. Ernst (George
Robertson, Melb'iT.
December
The usual batch of dilatory entries for the
sonnet competitions arrived on December 8,
five days too late. These eight sonnets ap-
preciably raise the level of the competi-
tion. M.8.K.. for instance, begins with
fervor thus :
December, Queen of dust and drought and death,
Within whose arms thy father, with’ring, dies—
The fierce light fades not from thy burning eyes,
A blood-red sun thy crown—a sword thy breath,
A slaying sword that flashes from its sheath
Yet sends its wild love paean to the skies;
But the sestette violently introduces an
alien idea. “Ivondar,” “Reka,” and Charles
J. Calhoun are to be commended for their
efforts. H. Russell Bruford fails to come up
to his happy beginning
December wears black ribbons in her hair,
Bewitching, yet such palpable pretence
Of mourning for the old year passing hence,
W hen ’tis her joy the baby year to bear....
And H. S. Allen, before he becomes incom-
prehensible, has some pleasant imagery and
false rimes:—
Old Sultan Year hath reaped a ripe reward:
December, to his harem borne unseen,
O’erlords it warmly, like a desert queen,
The fetich of some hot Arabian horde.
No houri she, but girded with a sword,
Brown-clothed in sackcloth Chidleywise and clean;
Her meat is milk and honeyfruit; and lean,
Loud locusts all her sentiments applaud.
Patricia Murchison’s sonnet, though her
octette refuses to conform with the strict
riming convention, is captivating enough to
print.
There is a certain sweetness in these days.
It is the sun (I said) that makes it so.
It is the wind that makes the grasses flow
In golden glory toward the sunset haze.
There is a light within the light that plays
Across the river, and upon the sea.
December whispers under every tree,
December sings along the white highways.
There are strange gleams that on the hilltops
run,
Holding a glint of laughter and of tears.
There is a shadowed glory in the skies
Is it the wind? (I said.) —Is it the sun?
Is it a promise fdr the future years?
Is it the beauty of a year thafl dies?
So, too, is this by Marie E. J. Pitt
Oh! Spurred and booted, hot-foot rideth she,
Her brown hand twisted in the flying mane
Of some toild stallion, pltmdered from his
plain
To be her charger of emergency —
Fit steed to bear so fierce a majesty
To war upon the dying year's demesne! —
So comes December, in a fiery rain,
Her bright bare falchion flashing at her knee.
Gall on your gods! 0 cities of dismay,
Lest she remember and stretch forth her
hand,
And loose her leaping terror, fold on fold,
The mad red houses never hand can hold.
And all you are be ciphers traced on sand —
The blown, white desert sand of Yesterday!
It may pay these poets to be more punc-
tual in their January entries, which must
reach this page by February 4.
Fiction
Edith Wharton determines to be popular,
but Edith Wharton is a “best seller” with a
difference. In The Custom of the Country
(Macmillan) the author deserts the bleak
tragedies of her Ethan Fromes, and adven-
tures gaily in high society, easily surpassing
Robert Chambers’s agreeable chatter. Un-
dine Spragg was named after a hair-waver
that her father put on the market the week
she was born: “It’s from andoolay, you know,
the French for crimping; father always
thought the name would make it take.”
Undine was a beautiful girl: she wanted
only one thing in the world, and that was
the best. And the easiest way for her to
get it was by means of a husband. So,
when her parents came to New York, after
having made a fortune in Apex, Undine
started out to get into the society where the
right sort of husbands abounded. She mar-
ries a charming, but futile, representative of
the old American aristocracy; but finds that,
after all, she has got only the second-best.
Her husband is not a millionaire. However,
she falls back upon the custom of the coun-
try—divorce; for, as the author remarks, the
American marriage still lias its uses: “One
couldn’t be divorced without it.” Undine’s
next experiment is with a French nobleman;
but now she finds that she has married not
her husband but the whole family. Quietly
she is put in her place by the tribe of her
new relations, and learns that she must live
not for herself but for the historic family,
even to the amount of firewood she is allowed
to burn in her cold, draughty chateau. She
has picked the wrong horse again. Once
more she tries her luck, whitewashed by dU
vorce, and. becomes the wife of the one man
who can manage her —a many times million-
aire. Edith Wharton keeps a secret about
this man till the right moment, with a shrewd
knowledge of its dramatic effect. Yet even
iu her last incarnation Undine, as ever
before, finds there are still heights to which
marriage has not lifted her. The husband
of a friend of hers beeomes Ambassador to
Britain ; and when the spoilt child asks her
husband for this bauble, too, she learns that
it is the one thing that all his millions cannot
get for her. The British Court won’t have
divorced Ambassadresses.
“‘I never heard of anything so insult-
ing !’ she cried, as if the rule had been
invented to humiliate her . . . . Under all the
dazzle a tiny black cloud remained. She
had learned that there was something she
could never get, something that neither
beauty nor influence nor millions could
ever buy for her. She could never be an
Ambassador’s wife; and as she advanced to
welcome her first guests she said to herself
that it was the one part she was really made
for.”
Somehow we feel sorry for Undine, but
more sorry for her son, by one of her early
husbands, who gets confused by the number
of step-fathers his mother has presented him
with ; and in the end we see the latest hus-
band and the son pathetically making friends
with each other, in a common defence against
Undine’s selfishness.
With the life of the several strata of
“society” in New York, to which Undine,
rising on her divorced husbands 'to higher
things, successively penetrates, Mrs. Whar-
ton is as familiar as she shows herself to be
with the jealously-guarded life of the old
French aristocracy. Her specimens of the
American “aristocracy” of wealth are pene-
tratingly and humorously observed; but her
satire becomes malevolent when she shows
us Undine. That girl is only what the
American parent had made her. The author
has, however, a larger theme than divorce:
she shows us the disintegration of the older
aristocracy of culture at the touch of
swiftly-made millions. Over New York is
sweeping a blizzard of wealth. On her
specific subject, however, the author has
something of importance to say. The. weak
point of the American marriage is: “The fact
that the average American looks down on his
wife.”
“ ‘How much does he let her share in the
real business of life? It’s normal for a
man to work hard for a woman —what’s ab-
normal is his not caring to tell her anything
about it.’
“ ‘To tell Undine? She’d be bored to
death if he did !’
“ ‘Just' so; she’d even feel aggrieved. But
why? Because it’s against the custom of
the country. And whose fault is that? The
man’s again.... Why haven’t we taught our
women to take an interest in our work?
Simnly because we don’t take enough inter-
est in them.’
“ ‘The American man doesn’t —the most
slaving, self-effacing, self-sacrificing ?’
“ ‘Yes ; and the most indifferent, there’s the
point In this country the passion for
making money has preceded the knowing how
to spend it, and the American man lavishes
his fortune on his wife because he doesn’t
know what else to do with it.’
“ ‘Then you call it S' mere want of imagi-
nation for a man to spend his monev on his
wife?’
“ ‘Not necessarily—but it’s a wdnt of ima-
gination to fancy it’s alh he owes
her. . . .In America the real crime yassionnet
is a “big steal” —there’s more excitement in
wrecking railways than homes. Isn c that
the key to our easy divorces V If we cared
tor women in the old barbarous, possessive
way do you suppose we’d give them up as
readily as we do? The real paradox is the
tact that the men who make, materially the
biggest sacrifices for their women, should do
the least for tliem ideally and romantically
....Money and motors and clothes are sim-
ply the big bribe a wife is paid for keeping
out of her husband’s way.’ ”
d*
Bertha Garlan, by Arthur Schnitzler,
translated from the German (Max Goschen
per Uymock’s Library), is a characteristic
novel from the Viennese author who has
hitherto been known in English literature
as, a dramatist. Ilis Anatol and The Green
Cockatoo are plays that have rapidly made
their way to the cosmopolitan stage. This
novel shows Schnitzler a craftsman as skil-
ful in fiction as in drama. It is merely the
story of a widow, whose marriage had brought
her little joy, gradually awaking to the pos-
sibilities of a passionate love. With infinite
delicacy and subtlety Schnitzler traces the
revival of her early love for a now celebrated
musician, leading fit last to her writing from
her small country town to him in Vienna.
Insensibly her love grows by the starved
imagination it hungrily feeds upon,-and at
last she meets him in Vienna. There follows
one night of passion. The woman, weak,
simple and loving, gives herself to him; but
the man is an egoist, and has no further use
for the adoring, but to him possibly stupid,
girl from the country. However, he sug-
gests that she might see him at long inter-
vals —thus putting her, contemptuously, in
her place. Then she, who had hoped to marry
him, recognises that she is not the sort of
woman for an intrigue. The death of a
woman friend, owing to an illegal opera-
tion, dramatically shows her her peril; and
she resigns, herself to her dull life in the
country.
t The character of Bertha Garlan is de-
picted with delicate precision, and with =uch
cogent detail as to make of this mere inci-
dent for a short story a novel of absorbing
interest. It is life—not the romantic imita-
tion of life that masquerades in popular
English fiction.
H. G. Wells begins, rather ponderously, a
new futurist novel, The World Set Free, in
the December English Review. He is go-
ing to tell us what will happen when atomic-
engines are invented—cheap machines for
obtaining power by disintegrating the atom
—a subject that the discovery of radium has
made for his hand. In the same issue of
this best of all English magazines, John
Masefield tails off in a poem called “The
River,” and Grant Watson writes a fine
Australian story on the theme of the black
gin and the white wife.
The aboriginal method of obtaining water
from the roots of trees—a method that has
saved the lives of white as well as of black,
and one of which no adult in Australia
should be ignorant—is fully explained, with
illustrations,_ by J. 11. Maiden, in part 1 of
vol. 6 of his valuable publication of The
Forest Flora of N.S. W.
A Literary and Historical Atlas of Africa
and Australasia, by J. G. Bartholomew, in
Dent’s “Everyman’s Library” (Is. 3d.) is
of value to Australians, though Africa has
priority of consideration by the editor. In
the foreword, too, Canberra is mis-spelt,
though in the map the spelling is correct,
►special maps dealing with us include “Early
\ oyages in the Pacific”’ and orograph-ical,
rainfall, vegetation, temperature, economic,
and population maps of Australasia.
Line maps include exploration routes, water
supply and agriculture for Vic. and N.S.W.,
Canberra and the chief cities, on, however,
too small a scale. There is also a page of
reproductions of early Australian coinage.
But Africa, with her plans of battles and
her ancient historic interest takes the bulk
of the space at the editor’s disposal. There
is room for an Australian publisher or the
federal Government to produce a real Aus-
tralian Atlas.
“Jimmie Kiushiu” writes :—■
Will Honorable arbiter of “Red Page” deign to
receive from unworthy but docile Japanese student
a humble paraphrase of competitively supreme sonnet
on November [Bulletin 18/12/’l3] ? To wit:
‘Sublime Australia in November is as a glorious
maternal lady doing as well as can be expected.
Obstetric operation indicated by modest allusion to
‘her flanks still heaving with her travail pain.’
About her is her Hon. and multitudinous progeny,
viz., ten thousand (10,000), more or less, of Hon.
cicadas, ditto Hon. mosquitoes, parrots and crabs, all
doing appropriate stunts. Remarkable lady exhibit-
ing seren; pride in phenomenal offspring. With
deep deference I thank the Hon. sonneteer for pub-
licly declared truth about Australia! Once the
Little Brown Man coveted a place in the s,un there,
but now
Barbara Holliday, by Marion Miller
Knowles (George Robertson, Melb.), is a
dull narrative of dull people. Its only claim
to mention here is that the dull people
treated _of are Australians and that the
writer is herself an Australian. This con-
ventional tale of the conventional love affairs
of a conventional school-mistress is written
in correct school-mistressy English and is
passably readable.

20 GAUGE, MODEL 1912
Hammerless
Repeating Shotgun
If you have ever used a light gun in
hunting, you will at once appreciate the
advantages of the Model 1912 Hammer-
less Repeating Shotgun. This new
Winchester weighs only 5H pounds —
about the weight of a .22 caliber rifle —
yet it is the strongest repeating shotgun
on the market, because, unlike others, its
metal parts throughout are made of
Nickel Steel. This lightness and strength
are combined with great beauty of out-
line and perfection of balance and finish.
Its action is positive and works with an
ease and smoothness not found in
other guns. It can be taken apart
and put together quickly and easily,
and in strong and accurate shoot-
ing qualities is fully up to the
high Winchester standard.
Go to a dealer and ask him
to show you one of them.
Always use Winchester
ammunition in Win-
chester guns as they are
made for each other .

evidence is that of those who have used it. It is never-failing. See
what MRS. E. WINGROVE, of Gympie, Queensland, a skilled nurse,
says of its efficacy
“After leaving off your treatment I waited several months
to see if the results were permanent before writing you, and
I now wish to say that I think the treatment is absolutely
marvellous. Before adopting it I Was only skin and bones,
but now I am one of the best walking advertisements you
could have. It did all you claimed for it and really more,
and the results were startlingly ahead of my fondest expec-
tations. My health and appearance have improved most
satisfactorily, and I now thank you for urging me to have
the treatment.”
We haven’t room to give you more letters here like this one, but we will send you scores of
them upon request. We possess thousands of grateful testimonials.
Many eases gain as much as 51b. a week, and improvements up to as much as ten inches

effects, and the results are permanent and lasting. It can be taken secretly.

“l't gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in
the week. It is now 12 months since I last used
tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-
ness, Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I
have every reason to believe were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are
only remembered as a hideous nightmare. I eat
and sleep well, and feel fit to face the world again.
Tt will give: me great pleasure to recommend your
remedy to others.”

The Question.
On being asked to take the bath at Tottenham,
London, a man started to say the Lord’s Prayer.
—Joyful news item.
Some of us pray for health,
And freedom from all pain;
Some of us pray for wealth,
And others pray for rain;
For water men have prayed,
And some still pray for beer;
And prayers for bread are made
Where bread is scarce and dear.
But here, O Lord, is one
Who feared not drought or pain;
An erring, unwashed son
Who dirty would remain—
Who, by lights low and dim,
Yet saw the Heavenly Hope—
Didst Thou deliver him
From water and from soap?
N.S.W.
O.C.C.
Oases.
Gazing upon the tale of wasted days
That mar the sweetness of my backward
way,
Here and again I glimpse one little day
Of profit, spent in worthier deed or praise—
One small oasis seen through mirk and haze
Of things ill-done in fever. Who shall say
But in the end these rare oases may
Atone for all the desert’s dust and blaze?
A narrow path and rugged I must keep
Now, till I pass yon hills into the Night;
But still the thought is precious that may be
The fair oases yet shall plead for me,
Who crave one boon amid this fading light,
God’s gracious immortality of sleep.
MAORILAND.
FRANK MORTON.
The Cheery Chiel.
By plain and hill, come good or ill,
Wherever Fortune’s footsteps strayed,
In woe or weal, the Cheery Chiel
Was welcomed for a rollick blade;
He wore a grin through thick and thin,
Nor ever drew the visage long,
But night and day withal was gay,
And lusty was his blithesome song:
Ho, fill the pan, and pass the can,
And thank our stars there's more to follow!
Good meat and ale shall never fail,
For earth holds more than man may swal-
low.
Then twang the string, and dance the fling,
And thank our stars there’s joy in pran-
cing;
Give over grumps and doleful dumps,
And set the lads and lasses dancing!"
As near he drew the tidings flew,
And crabbed Dulness slunk away;
While Jolly Jinks, with quips and winks,
Set up his court of cronies gay.
With jocund reel the Cheery Chiel
Drew these and sundry to his train;
Nor any heart might mope apart,
Or brood in tribulations vain.
“Come, lilt the rhyme, and trip the time,
For laughter is our largest treasure;
There is no dearth of this on earth;
Then let no niggard stint the measure.
This ivisdom fits all jovial wits,
And only churls shun merry-making;
Let none repine while love and wine
And goodly fare are his for taking!"
The whiles he flung, to old and young,
The largess of his friendly grin ;
Till, mean or high, they hailed him by
With answered mirth, through thick and
thin.
For, foul or fair, he hummed an air,
And tossed a jest to every jar;
To joyance leal, the Cheery Chiel
Spread mellow magic wide and far!
“Then deck the hoard and clear the sward,
While summer makes the pulses tingle;
And hey! for nights, when winter kites,
Of quips and stories round the ingle.
Old gallant Cheer is always here,
With humor in his mien and raiment,
To draw his best from every guest —
He asks hut welcome as repayment!"
VICTORIA.

Winds of Home.
When westerly winds from the mountains
Come galloping down,
Over the plains and the rivers—
Over the turreted town.
And I close my eyes, I can see the hills
Of Wellington, dry and brown,
And smell the summer grasses
That are brushed by the wind’s blue gown.
When boisterous winds from ihe mountains
Roar over the trees —
Over the masts and the water,
Raising the ripples to seas —
And I dream awhile, I can hear the song
Of a shouting northerly breeze,
And, deep in the shady gorse-blooms,
The drone of the drowsy bees.
When winds from the wide, Blue Mountains
Dash down to the sea,
And the city abandons her labor
To chafe at the mad winds’ glee—
A vision of high, bare wintry hills
Comes, vividly clear, to me.
Oh! the sting of the keen, clean winter,
In the land where my heart would be.
Oh! winds blowing down from the moun-
tains,
Mad winds that roam,
And scream through the trees and the rig-
ging,
And over high turret and dome —
When I hear their song, as a deeper note
Sung low to my heart you come,
Sweet from the skies and the grasses,
Wonderful winds of home.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

WANTED, A DEMI-GOD—OR POS-
SIBLY A PLAIN COVE WILL DO.
The Northern Territory—the place that
everybody talks about, but where hardly
anybody does anything except appoint Fed-
eral officials —had another advertisement
recently. Judge Bevan came down from
the empty province, and propounded his
views—about the 700th set of views to date.
Some other opinions have been recently fur-
nished by Inspector-of-Mines Oliver ; also
Dr. Richard Jones has contributed. Then
Prime Minister Cook, in one of the intervals
of doing nothing, by reason of an insufficient
majority, digested these statements, especi-
ally the most depressing ones, and gave his
verdict on them in this fashion :
THE MAN WANTED.
FOR THE NORTH.
WHERE IS HE COMING FROM?
Melbourne, Friday.—The views which have been
expressed by recently-returned travellers from the
Northern Territory do not, in the opinion of the
Prime Minister, assist much in the solution of the
difficult problem of peopling this latest possession of
the Commonwealth.
“I have read all the statements very carefully,”
said Mr. Cook to-day, “including those made by
Judge Bevan, Mr. Oliver (the inspector of mines)
and Dr. Richard Jones. Take the latter’s state-
ments. They are the same as those made by a num-
ber of medical gentlemen, but they do not help
much. Dr. Jones, in laying down the conditions
for successful residence in the Territory, says a man
must be constitutionally strong and be in perfect
health. His habits must be perfect; he must be
temperate and moral. In other words, he must be a
picked man. The question is, can we pick enough
men to people the Territory, and find them sufficient
inducement to go up there under the present condi-
tions? It is very good to say that you must have
perfect hygienic conditions and physically perfect
men, but that does not touch the very serious
economic questions which have to be considered.
After you have admitted all that, the great problem
has still to be solved, and I hope that by concentrat-
ing the united ability and patriotism of the nation
on it we may find the solution, and that speedily.”
Now, The Bulletin has no desire to be
unpleasant to any man with an insufficient
majority, but it is dead weary of this mas-
sive way of putting the case. The habit
of using elephantine language about the
Territory merely obscures the issue. Heavy
people discuss it as if it were Sheol, or the
Decalogue, or the Great Pyramid, or a per-
fectly new disease, or the remains of the
Holy Roman Empire, and as if none of the
old rules or precedents applied to it. In
other words, they partly disguise their in-
capacity or laziness by pretending that there
is a mystery where there is none, just as the
Knight of the Round Table, when he came
home badly licked, might explain his defeat
by stating that the enemy was 16ft. high and
had a habit of breathing flames from his
stomach.
The “problem” of the Territory was once
the problem of all Australia. It is still the
problem of Northern Westralia, and in a
much less degree of Northern and Central
Queensland, and in a very big degree of more
than half of New South Wales —the half
which, by reason of the Sydney congestion
policy, is steadily losing population. It is
furthermore the problem of a part of Vic-
toria—the part which is losing population by
reason of the Melbourne congestion policy.
The name of the trouble is Partial or Com-
plete Emptiness, and the remedy is to grow
or acquire more good white people to occupy
the country, and to give them the necessary
facilities for getting there. The case may
be set out in a handful of propositions:—
(1) Where a country contains only 11- persons
per square mile, a good many square miles are sure
to be vacant.
(2) As the population increases the number of
vacant square miles is liable to diminish.
(3) As few people walk when they can go by
train, settlement follows the lines of railroad when-
ever possible, provided there is a reserve of popula-
tion at one end of the railroad and good available
land beside it or at the other end; and assuming
that the railway management is sane and the land
system isn’t quite mad. This tendency is increased
by the fact that when there is a reserve of popula-
tion at one end of the line there are generally
facilities for the sale or export of produce. As the
settler doesn’t grow produce out of sheer cussedness
or lack of faith in a Hereafter, this outlet is im-
portant.
(4) If a railway starts where there is hardly any-
body and ends where there is nobody, it does little
good for settlement for lack of people to settle, and
because the complete Robinson Crusoe act, under-
taken for pure love of RoBiNSON-ing, appeals to but
few.
(5) When there is no railway at all, things are
apt to be a darned sight worse than as specified in
paragraph 4. This fact has also been hinted at in
paragraph 1.
(6) Putting the case into a condensed form, the
two things which retard settlement are want of
facilities to bring people and lack of the pressure
of great crowds behind to shove people.
And these simple propositions ought to be
pasted in the hat.
* * * *
Australia started to solve the problem of
the North according to these same simple
propositions. There were hitches and breaks
and intervals and discrepancies, but the gen-
eral policy was sound and steady. Settle-
ment began at the south-east corner of the
continent, because the dangerous northern
seas were too tangled for the helpless old
sailing ships, and the Barrier Reef was a
huge difficulty. Then, probably by instinct
or accident, rather than by close reasoning,
the pioneers began to spread northward, ac-
cording to certain logical principles. They
went step by step, except when they made
mistakes. The first attempt to create a
colony of North Australia and to establish
an isolated settlement at Gladstone failed,
probably because the proposed capital was
too long a stride from the old centres. It
was even a worse failure than the still more
isolated Port Darwin. But settlements
were afterwards formed one by one at mod-
erate intervals, and as each was furnished
with its little bit of railway to connect it
with the West, it began to look as if these
places had come to stay. Then the main line
of railway which connected the North with
the South was steadily pushed ahead, and
the new settlements took firmer root, and
became nailed down and fixed. So far as
swift and regular and fairly cheap means of
communication were provided it proved that
the great problem of the North was no
problem at all. The old thing simply solved
itself as it went along. And even some dis-
tance ahead of the main railway the problem
—though the term wasn’t invented then-
solved itself on the strength of the assurance
that better means of communication were
coming. There was no special search for
settlers who were “constitutionally strong
and in perfect health,” “picked men,” “tem-
perate and moral,” and of almost super-
human, not to say heavenly, habits. Nobody
hunted for demi-gods to populate Rockhamp-
ton and Townsville and pther places. Even
at Bowen feathers and a harp weren’t in-
sisted upon. Any decent sort of cove who
wanted to go there just went there, and with
reasonable facilities there was no serious
lack of coves.
* * * *
Of course there are failures —or rather
places where success is postponed. The
scrap of line which extends inland from
Cooktown hasn’t greatly boomed Cooktown
as yet. It is so very far away from any
prospect of connection with the big centres
which have population to spare that its
boom is necessarily hung up. The isolated
bit of railway between Normanton and
Croydon is an even worse case of a lone-
some fragment of civilisation crying in the
wilderness. The Darwin-Pine Creek road is
just as bad. These are the lines which, sd
far, lead from almost nobody to hardly any-
body, and they do that because it is hardly
worth anybody’s while to go there while
there are so many more accessible places
fpr somebody to go to. They are as bad as,
but not much worse than, a certain isolated
line which N.S.W. once possessed in its
Northern Rivers , country—an enterprise
wind! pervaded a rich locality, yet for lack of
a definite purpose hardly paid for axle-grease,
Incidentally, the really great problem of the
north is not the Territory but the northern
section of Westralia, which, by reason of
similar causes, is the Territory over again,
but without many of its natural advantages,
Politically the North is divided into three
barts - Queensland is showing how to do it.
The Territory and Northern Westralia are
showing how not_ to do it. The one State
winch has done it to a fair extent simply
pushed its railways north, did its best in the
way of joining the places which wanted
people with the places which had a few
people to spare, then let things adjust them-
selves without talking about the “problem.”
it Queensland had started its trunk railway
from the far end southward instead of from
Lrisbane northward, it might have made the
same ha.sh of its chances as its next-door
neighbor has done. The work would have
been for many years an unpayable thing
without a purpose. The futile globe-trotter
would have landed for an hour or so at,
perhaps, Cairns, as_ he now does at Port
Darwin, and have mistaken the place for all
Queensland as he now mistakes Darwin for
the whole _ Northern Territory, and would
nave said in haste—;as David of Israel put
the matter—that it was an impossible sort
°t spot. Then there would have been the
® ame sort of discussion about this section of
jme North as there is about the, one next
door, and the same foolish talk about the
need or finding some immaculate settler
with wings and a golden crown to take up
land there unless the place was to be aban-
doned as hopeless. Seeing that all the sue-
cess which Australia has achieved with its
iNorth has been done by making the attack
rrom_ the comparatively well-peopled South,
it might be well to stick to the old habits,
and invade the Territory from the south
also at the Adelaide end, where the hiffh,
cooi. lairly-well-watered tableland is. On
these methods, as shown by Queensland’s
experience, a Demi-god isn’t essential as
pioneer. The work can be done in some
sort ot fashion by a Cove.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Weak Navy Insanity.
From “The Old Soldier”
thp Dr fnli ßT 3 Uß h ?5- bee " bleating afresh, I see, about
the folly of anything but a species of semi-Defence
Austra f ha ' how would Australia
stand, in the event of a European war, if its navy
were weak? What security would it have against a
cruising, commerce-destroying war? The Arthur
type of strategist will answer that the British navy
is supreme, has always protected Australia, and wiil
F’rTvn'Lo 0 S °h> Ye , t , 1 ?° years a &° did not protect
r LINDERS, with all his charts and journals, from
capture and a long imprisonment at Mauritius. More
tnan that, the British navy was practically supreme
m the seas round the British Islands during the
almost continuous series of wars from 1688 to 1814
and yet it could not save merchant ships in the
Channel and the North Sea from capture by hun-
dreds. A writer in Blackwood says of one period:
During the war from 1688 to 1697, the privateers
ot St. Malo alone claimed to have taken 162 war-
ships and 3384 merchantmen of one sort and another
—an average of more than a merchantman a day for
that one town for nine years.”
Not only single ships were taken, but sometimes
large convoys with some of the warships escorting
them. Here is an instance:—-
“In May, 1707, a convoy of 50 merchant ships
sailed from the Downs escorted by the Royal Oak, of
74 guns, and the Grafton and Hampton Court, both
of 70 guns. The French captain, Forbin, was wait-
ing for them at Dunkirk with three ships of over
50 guns each, six of over 40 guns each, and four
corvettes. Borbin came up with the convoy off
Brighton. The captains of the Grafton and Hamp-
ton Court were killed before their ships were sur-
rendered.”
The latter ship had 200 of her crew killed and
wounded, and 22 of the convoy were taken. In
October of the same year what was called the Portu-
gal fleet sailed with a powerful escort, consisting of
two 80-gun ships, a 74, and two 50’s. This was what
happened:—
“Forbin and Duguay-Trouin swooped down on the
convoy. The former had eight of the nine large
ships with which he had taken tge Grafton and
Hampton Court in May. DuguayArouin led out
from Brest a 72, a 64, two 50’s, and two smaller
shins of over 30 guns. The result was inevitable.
There was a tremendous fight in the Channel. The
Devonshire (80 guns) took fire and blew up with
most of her 700 men. The Cumberland, the other
80, was taken, as were the two 50’s, the Chester and
Ruby, and with them were taken, according to a
reliable account, 30 sail of merchantmen.”
Later in the century the British fleet blockaded
the regular French fleets in Brest and Toulon, but
was almost powerless to do more than check the
depredations of the privateers which issued in swarms
from St. Malo, Dunkirk, and a score or so of other
ports. What if we find ourselves suffering from the
same sort of nuisance while the British Dreadnought
fleets are making demonstrations along the German
North Sea coast, and we have only our two cruisers,
and some destroyers, and Maoriland has nothing to
protect our trade against commerce destroyers? A
strong local navy is going to be Australia’s only
salvation in the future.
British Socialism and Australian
Security.
The following London cables appeared in
juxtaposition in the local dailies recently:—
The rank and file of the Liberals are much stirred
by the antagonism which has risen between Mr.
Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty,
and Mr. Lloyd George, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
on the question of naval construction. They fear
an open break between the two Ministers over the
navy estimates. The Liberal press supports Mr.
Lloyd George.
The British Socialist party has decided to run
candidates for a large number of Scottish constitu-
encies during the next elections.'
There is a sort of relation between the two
messages; and together they have a power-
ful bearing on the Australian defence ques-
tion. One of the features of British politics
to-day is the growing strength of the Social-
ist party. The social reform and land pro-
posals of Lloyd George are impelling dukes
and the like to sell, or try to sell,
estates that their ancestors got dirt
cheap in the dim, individualistic past.
Anti-Sosh leagues are formed; conserva-
tive leader-writers blither; butlers, city
clerks, parsons, elderly ladies, parlor maids,
bishops, superannuated members of both
Services, and the genteel classes, generally,
demand in a stupefied manner why Provi-
dence doesn’t interfere and check the in-
famy. Yet Socialism goes steadily ahead.
The well-to-do are taking to it, in many cases,
as warmly as the indigent. Admittedly one
Z >St Socialistic measures cf
lecent times was the British Insurance Act.
Speaking as an employer,” said Sir
K™1 LEVE £ ! he millionaire soap manu
tacturer, to a Sydney paper, last week, ‘‘l
can say that the Insurance Act is a beneficent
measure, and a success in every respect.”
In tact, the long overdue social reform move-
ment has definitely arrived in the United
Kingdom. In order to achieve the further
instalment of Socialistic legislation for which
most thinking Britons employers as well as
employees—consider the Time is now Bine it
will be necessary for the nation to return’to
I arliament more men of advanced ideas than
it has in the past. Now, the British Radical
is, almost invariably, a sort of anti-defencite.
Also he is a sort of anti-imperialist. That is
to say, he deprecates the blewing of an un-
necessarily large sum on the fleet, and he is
opposed to the profitless bloating of the Em-
pire, on the grounds that these things cost
money which could better be spent on the
amelioration of the lot of Britain’s half-
starved underworld. It is as certain as any-
thing can be that if the British Socialist, or
any other Party, runs candidates at the next
elections, in Scotland or elsewhere, on the
social reform ticket, a number of them will
win. Incidentally, every Parliamentary vote
for more Socialism must mean a vote for de-
creased naval estimates. Apart from the fact
that pacificism is the traditional policy of the
Radical wing in the United Kingdom, there is
the further circumstance that even if the in-
evitable advanced Radical, or Labor, or
Socialist Government of the future aspired
after a big navy, it couldn’t enjoy that luxury,
and any measure of social reform worth talk-
ing about, at the same time. The finances
simply wouldn’t run to it. There is another
excellent reason why a British Labor Ad-
ministration would turn down the all-power-
ful variety of fleet that successive Liberal
Administrations have stood for steadfastly,
despite the fulminations of the Lloyd
Geoeges in their midst, and of the bigger
section of the party press. The British Liberal
Party, as at present constituted, is really a
Whig Party. Its vested interests are as consid-
erable. as those of the Tories, and many of
those interests are situated in the Dominions
overseas. The Lever firm purchased a pro-
perty in M.L. only last week, and other big
Liberal firms and individuals are doing like-
wise. every day of the year. The first
British Labor Government will not be repre-
sentative of people who possess assets in
Australia or S’Africa or Canada. It will
hold office by virtue of the suffrages of folks
to whom it would not matter materially if
“the colonies” were wiped off the face of the
earth. Australia’s present position is com-
fortingly secure. An Asiatic or other inva-
sion is unlikely, if only from the fact that,
even assuming an army corps of Japs or
Chqws effected a landing here, it would
want something in the way of overseas sup-
plies ; and those supplies would never arrive
with the British fleet at its present strength,
and the directors of that fleet keenly alive to
the necessity of “preserving the Empire in-
tact” —or, to put it in plain English, alive to
the necessity of “preserving their national in-
terests in these regions.” Unless, of course, a
big European Power selected the moment of
attack for doing something that would keep
Bull’s ships busy in Bull waters, Australia
can drift along more or less safely with a
weak fleet for the present—say for the next
five or six years. But from the moment the in-
evitable occurs, and the Socialist or Labor
Government invades the Treasury benches at
Westminster, the Commonwealth will have
as much hope of living, in a national sense —
assuming it is still, as at present, virtually
undefended—as Daniel would have had in
the lions’ den if the lions hadn’t been squared
or induced to run stiff. Once in the long ago
an English Parliament decided that its for-
eign dominions were too expensive and also
gave it the tired feeling, and that sort of
event might happen again.
—
A Wrong Way with Trees, and a Rotten
Way with Convicts.
“Lex” holdeth forth :
Touching the question of re-afforestation by prison
labor, 1 see (B. 8/l/’l4) that one “Norbell” has
appeared voluntarily for the defence in the case of
Myself x. the Holman Government. Defendants
harve many grievous faults, but I question whether
they deserved the disastrous advocacy of “Norbell,”
who is all there in the matter of cheap sentimen-
tality, bellowdrama, misguided enthusiasm, and so
on, but who in the urgent matter of knowledge of
his subject is several miles over the fence. For
example, he berates me for my approval of the
“separate. treatment” system, and quotes, in support
of his views, an impressive piece from Charles
Dickens on the evils and horrors of “solitary con-
finement.” Every criminologist, every lawyer, in
fact every citizen who has been through a gaol, appre-
ciates the radical difference between the separate
treatment system and solitary confinement. The
latter may be said to be practically non-existent in
N. S. Wales to-day. Separate treatment signifies
merely an arrangement under which the fallen sheep
are kept apart as much as possible from the criminal
goats. Thus an entirely different class of offender is
sent to Bathurst from the sort that goes to Parra-
matta. Most of the latter are hopeless, or very
nearly so; many of the Bathurst eonfinees are con-
sidered to have a good chance of being reformed into
decent citizens. And in all the gaols the apparently
repentant are kept out of touch, as much as possible,
with the palpably incorrigible. But otherwise there
is very little solitariness about modern prison life.
The men work together, exercise ' together, drill toge-
ther and go to church together. Certainly they
sleep in separate cells ; but as these are well-iighted,
during those hours when healthy, hardworking men
desire to keep awake, and as library books are
allowed in them, the fact is not regarded by those
concerned as a hardship.
“Norbell” betrays his edifying lack of famili-
arity with the prisons of N. S. Wales by one of
those minor touches which signify so much. “Does
a prisoner,” he asks, “in the horror-haunted confines
of Darlinghurst ever learn a useful trade?” Cer-
tainly not. Neither does he in the horror-haunted
confines of the Black Maria. Darlinghurst is not,
and has not been for many years, a gaol in the
proper acceptation of the term. It is merely a
clearing-house for criminals—a place where people
wait to be tried, executed or released on payment of
costs or what not incurred in bankruptcy, and such-
like proceedings. In the by no means horror-haunted
confines of gaols such as Parramatta, Goulburn,
Bathurst and Maitland, prisoners certainly do learn
useful trades. Moreover, the official figures go to
show that the majority of the men take to those
trades on their release, and tyereafter maintain
themselves and their families by them; or, at any
rate, it is fairly to be assumed that they do, inas-
much as but a trifling percentage of prisoners return
to gaol after having once left it.
The chief and most obvious objection to re-affores-
tation by prison labor consists in the fact that, unless
the experiment is conducted on a large scale, it
involves the association, on familiar terms, of crimi-
nals of all grades. This may be pleasanter for some
of the criminals, but it is demonstrably bad for
them in the mass, and more particularly is it bad for
the better sort of prisoner. The inevitable effect is
for the stronger individualities—who arc usually the


most desperate offenders —to dominate the weaker
ones, and so cause crime to be glorified ; a tendency
that the prison reformer has to fight every day of
his life. You can separate the good from the bad,
and the weak from the strong more or less effectually
within the confines of a prison; it is utterly im-
possible to do it in a forest. A second objection to
the M.L. system lies in the fact that a criminal who
has served his time tree-planting emerges on the
world helpless. Society, as at present constituted,
has no place for the expert tree-planter. The result
in N. S. Wales must be—once the Hodman Govern-
ment’s disastrous scheme gets into good going order
—that year by year a body of law-breakers will be
unloosed on the community, with no remunerative
trades to fall back upon ; a development which will
be exceedingly unpleasant for the community, as the
experience of M.L. goes to show.
If “Norbell” is under the delusion that M.L.’s
afforestation system is a success because it has stood
for 15 years, he needs to forget that error, just as
he does his errors in re Darlinghurst, etc. Maoriland’s
notoriously uneconomical, and from the prisoner s
viewpoint ethically pernicious, scheme has been per-
sisted in for the reason that so many other foolish-
nesses are persisted in there and elsewhere —because,
namely, it is an institution which appeals to the
uninstructed and the ultra-sentimental, and which,
under the party government system, is accordingly a
perilous thing to shift. Every student of prison
questions in M.L. knows that the arrangement is
rotten; and that it had been turned down by the
rest of the world, after due examination of it, with
the utmost unanimity, till a N. S. Wales Labor
Government took it up. Re-afforestation, as Norway,
Sweden, Germany and a dozen other big countries
have shown, is as much a matter for State
enterprise as water conservation, defence, and
so forth. But once a country gets busy with
a scheme like convict afforestation, which, at
vast expense in the way ,of time and monev,
gives a surface appearance of paying its
way, while making things a little brighter for
wrongdoers, an army of “Norbells” immediately
comes into existence and barracks blindly for its
continuanae. There is a type of well-meaning idiot
who would cheerfully advocate the advisability of
continuing to employ convicts at the job of trout-
fishing on the Snowy River, assuming such a
demented system were ever inaugurated. It is this
dreary fact which makes it necessary for patriotic
Australians to assail vigorously the Holman Admini-
stration’s aspiration to give the criminal classes —
to their own ultimate detriment —a good time at
the exncnse of the section of the community that
obeys the laws.
As in the Days of Herod.
Dear Bulletin, —Tasmania’s population,
despite the fact that it can’t get away
without crossing the water, still continues
to take the risk of sea-sickness. For the
nine months ending September last (figures
for the last quarter are not yet available)
the natural increase was 2671, but the excess
of departures over arrivals by sea was 4268.
The dead loss for the first nine months of
the year was thus 1597. As there is always
a big influx of summer trippers about the
end of the year, it is estimated that the
fiaal figures to December 31 will show a
total gain of 532. If these estimates are
realised, the population will reach 201,000
—about one-third of Sydney’s total. But as
the summer visitors all depart from the
Speck during the first quarter of the year,
the end of March will see the figures slump
again to about 197,000. Luckily for the
Tas. Treasury the Federal 255. per
capita is paid on the population as at Decem-
ber 31, when the population is always 4000
or 5000 better than in the winter. The
local birth-rate is the highest in the Com-
monwealth; yet the average excess of emi-
gration over immigration during the past
15 years has just about nullified the baby
surplus, and seems likely to keep on nulli-
fying it, for these reasons: —
(1) The scale of wages is lower t-han in other
States.
(2) The Income Tax exemption is lower. (In-
comes of £lOO a year are subject to tax.)
(3) The cost of living is high.
Wages are low because of the unfortunate
tendency on the part of the Government and
private employers to regard low wages as
the basis of prosperity, and because. indus-
trial organisation for higher wages is only
in its infaney. Taxation is high because
the country has borrowed so largely for non-
revenue producing purposes that its interest
bill now amounts to nearly half its total
annual revenue, wherefore it cannot afford
to let even a £2 per week laborer escape
the drag-net of direct taxation. And the
cost of living is high because the country
doesn’t grow or manufacture sufficient to
feed and clothe itself, and has to pay high
freights to the steamship monopoly for beef
grown and goods manufactured elsewhere;
moreover, in the cities rents are ruinous be-
cause of the drift of the population from
the decayed villages of the interior. Immi-
grants fail to arrive from overseas in any
appreciable numbers, or to stay in the coun-
try if they do happen to arrive, for the same
reasons that propel the native-born into
exile. When a fertile country like Tas-
mania, with no manufactures worth men-
tioning, and whose biggest city isn’t 40,000
strong, finds itself with only one primary
producer to the square mile, it is surely time
for the application of heroic measures. But
the Solomon Government doesn’t even pre-
tend to view the almost stationary popula-
tion with anything approaching alarm. No
effort is being made to attract either labor
or capital to the island ; no effort is made
to stop the exodus of the working
population. The State’s 450 miles of de-
crepit railways meander through thousands
of acres of fertile land devoted to sheep and
rabbits and briar-bushes at a dead loss of
nearly £70,000 per annum, and hardly any
attempt is made to convert that freightless
territory into a paying asset by means of a
thumping land tax. The old policy of com-
nelling the genuine land-worker to settle in
inaccessible regions, far from rivers and rail-
ways and roads, is being continued ; and to
provide these settlers with indifferent roads
and worse schools the Government is spend-
ing nearly twice as much as it gets for the
land. The mongy representing the annual
loss is balanced by an annual loan, which
increases the public debt and the interest
bill without providing a means of paying
either. Labor suggested that the recent
windfall from the Commonwealth —£900,000
spread over ten years—should be earmarked
■for the purchase of hydro-electric works,
the establishing of State saw-mills, and the
proposed Ouse Valley irrigation, railway
and closer settlement scheme. But, instead
of doing anything so sensible, Solomon’s
Government is spending the money in mere
sand-shifting projects calculated to pay no
dividends with the utmost regularity for the
next quarter century, at least; and by that
time most of the sand will have drifted back
into the toy. canals, and the worm that dieth
not will have eaten the bridges and the crazy
little jetties, and the macadam of the high-
ways will have been pulverised by the traffic
which high rail\yay freight is even now
transferring from the railways to the roads.
Then the loan evil will break out in a fresh
place, for the joint and several ver-
tebrae of the districts affected will rise up
as one valley of dry backbones and demand
that the vanished assets shall be re-built by
forging the name of Posterity on an lOU.
And pretty soon after that the foreign in-
vestor will discover that the alarming
growth of the public debt and interest
charges has driven all possible parents out
of the State, and the lOU forged on Pos-
terity will be valueless, for there will be no
Posterity worth mentioning. Then, pre-
sumably, Tasmania will be seized for debt
and the Commonwealth will have to find the
money to get rid of the bailiff, and the
Speck’s name as a sovereign State will be
Mudj For persistently heading towards
this brand of perdition the Speck’s rulers
deserve to be classed as first-class lunatics ;
while for handing over to such rulers a free
gift of £900,000 without imposing stringent
conditions as to how the money should be
spent, the Commonwealth Parliament lias
shown itself an over-indulgent parent and
fully entitled to the usual reward thereof.
A wiser organisation would have put the
£900,000 in the hands of public trustees, to
accumulate at compound interest until it
overtook and obliterated the Tasmanian
debt, and thus forced the isle into doing a
clean-up. But alas ! there are so very few
wiser organisations.—Yours, etc., John D.
History as She Is Wrote.
“Locust” discusses Parkes and a
panegyrist:—
For an example of history garbled to bolster up
the posthumous reputation of one man, commend
me to B. R. Wise’s “Making of the Australian Com-
monwealth,” wherein the old, haphazard Parkes
has his Special pleader. For years we have had
Parkes accepted as the leader of the movement for
free, secular and compulsory education, although
he 'fought it in the unscrupulous bandit fashion
which was charaeteristic of him in Opposition, and
finally only accepted it under the pressure of James
Greenwood and George Dibbs. Yet the Bashi-
Bazouk fighting which Parkes put in against educa-
tion was tame and uneventful compared with the
bitter opposition he made to Federation. He opposed
every movement for the union of these States — every
movement—until the subject was forced on him, as
the education movement was, and ever so many other
movements.
Parkes had no constructive power. That was one
of his defects, and there were 99 others. He could
copy, but his disposition was to resist; and so he
was the most formidable and most unscrupulous
Opposition leader we have ever seen. There were two
reasons why he should have opposed every practical
movement for Federation. One was narrowness of mind.
The other was the knowledge that he couldn’t sup-
port Federation without being expected, unless he
was prepared to take a back seat, to draft a scheme,
and when a big question was on hand he could no
more draft a workable and statesmanlike scheme
than a gorilla could manufacture an umbrella. He
never felt very deeply about any great public ques-
tion ; in fact, his line was small questions, loud
noises and horribly bad poems.
The Federal Council existed. It had not much
power, certainly, but it was a beginning, and was
a huge step when one reflects upon the isolation and
jealousy of the States at that period, and remembers
that it was before the upheaval of Labor democracy
in 1891. The Council only needed the adhesion of
N. S. Wales to make it the jumping-off place for
something bigger. Gillies, on behalf of the other
States, offered Parkes (1) the leadership of the
bigger movement, (2) an alteration of the Constitu-
tion of the Federal Council to suit N.S.W., (3) a
free hand in proposals for defence, and the settle-
ment of the Westralian question, and (1) an exten-
sion of the functions of the Council “to consider
and formulate the proposals of the larger Federa-
tion.” Parkes, the critic, opponent, opportunist
and writer of bad poems, refused the offer, and
thereby stopped the clock for 10 years.
Gillies wrote (Wise, p. 16) : “Now, why should
you not join us to do this great worlr? What is
the difficulty? Surely it would be a worthy ambi-
tion for you to adopt the best mearns at your dis-
posal—in fact, at your hand—to unite Australia in
a Federation. .. .No one at present can do the work
but you. You can remove the Federation barrier
which has been created by the isolation of N. S.
Wales from all the other colonies in the Federal
movement. .. .What you refuse to-day someone else
will do to-morrow, and I should be pleased to see
you take the pride of place.” In face of this, Wise
talks of the “unwillingness of Gillies and the other
Premiers to co-operate with Parkes,” and says it
was due to “a suspicion of his motives in proposing
to supersede the Federal Council.” But Wise “gives
the show away” in this sentence; “The inconsist-
ency of his [Parkes’s] present attitude was attri-
buted to a vainglorious unwillingness to take part
in any federal movement of which he was not him-
self the leader.” This is a perfectly accurate sum-
ming-up of Parkes’s attitude in regard to every
great public question throughout his career in
politics, and most conspicuously in regard to three —
(1) one-man-one-vote (pioneered by W. H. Traill),
(2) Education (pioneered by the Rev. James Green-
wood), and (3) Federation. Wise says: “Echoes of
these charges may be heard even at the present
time.” And they will be heard as more than echoes
when history is written, not garbled.
There are so many other inaccuracies in Wise’s
book that it would take another volume to correct
them. For instance, there is his account of Parkes’s
retirement in 1891, when he left “hoffis” in order
to curry favor with the employers (newly combined
for the first time), and threw over his faithful fol-
lower, Sid Smith, and the eight-hour clause of the
Mines Bill, at the behest of McMillan. According
to Wise, this was a noble, positively-heroic, piece
of self-abnegation on Parkes’s part. He forgets
that those in the House knew that Parkes, after
opposing William Henry Traill’s one-man-one-
vote proposals, characteristically stole it and put
it in his programme to catch the Labor vote in the
new House of 1891, when " Labor came in for the
first time in numbers; and, after playing with the
Labor party for nine months, he went out of office
on a Labor measure introduced by his own Minister
of Mines (which he must have acquiesced in in
Cabinet) in order to “dish” the Labor party.
Wise’s piece of special pleading should not be
allowed ot go without protest, nor his garbling of
recent history to pass without correction. Neither
his nor the other orthodox writers’ attempts to
create a fictitious historical personage of Parkes
by crediting him with the merit of everything he
opposed till it was forced on him will in' the end
succeed. He was not a statesman; he was merely
a very cunning politician. He never pioneered a
great measure, but opposed everything of import-
ance till the pressure of the stream was too power-
ful, and then he turned round and went with the
stream, and claimed credit for his wonderful merit
in doing so.
The Language Test, and What It Is Used
For.
The good old days when Australia was re-
garded as a Heaven-sent dumping-ground for
alcoholic wrecks, consumptives and similar
rejects from other countries are departing
with great thoroughness. Thanks to the
efforts of the great Liberal dailies, there is an
extensive popular notion that the Immigration
Restriction Acts were designed for the specific
purpose of turning back valuable additions to
our national brain and brawn, by the simple
process of requiring, say, a Lithuanian, to
translate 50 words of Irish, or Swiss-Aus-
trian, or some other European language. The
Socialistic Tiger is supposed to utter glad
roars, and to wag his tail with delight, as the
rejected immigrant gathers up his vast and
sturdy family and retires from our Great
Waste Spaces. As a matter of actual fact,
so far as white people are concerned, the
language test is used only when there is no
other legal method of keeping out a morally
or physically undesirable newcomer. The
principal use of the Acts is for excluding the
physically unfit, who will either become a
charge on State or municipal funds, or will
introduce loathsome or contagious disease.
Almost every big batch of immigrants is
found to contain some undesirables of this
class, and although better arrangements for
medical examination before departure from
Europe will ultimately reduce the proportion
verv greatly, hundreds of persons suffering
from syphilis, advanced consumption and
other contagious diseases must have been
rejected at Australian ports during the last
few years. A considerable assortment of
lunatics, alcoholics and other degenerates
have also been passed out in the same way.
The examination is not confined to the steer-
age, and not a few undesirables have been
found amongst the class who wear boiled
shirts at the evening gorge when the sea is
not too rough. The beastly rudeness of the
“Colonials” was deeply resented at first by
the more brassbound variety of ship’s doctor;
but a thumping penalty for any attempt to
evade inquiry by the Federal Health officers
has cleared the marine atmosphere. Conse-
quently, the Hon. Coukcy Howard’s medi-
cal record for the voyage receives the same
attention as that of Bile Jones in the
steerage. A just and sensible arrangement
allows for a bond in doubtful or difficult
cases, under which the newcomer may land
conditionally on undergoing treatment and
reporting for an official medical examination
at a later date. The rejected partv also has
a second run for his money at the port to
which he is actually booked (the principal
examination is made at the ship’s first port
of entry), and if the second doctor passes
him he gets in. Elaborate arrangements
are being made for medically examining im-
migrants before their departure from the
Cold Country, in order that all reasonable
chance of hardship from medical rejection
may be avoided. But even then the Aus-
tralian system will provide for an open door
compared with the requirements for admis-
sion to the United States or Canada.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
George Reid again harped upon the tendency of
the people to concentrate in the large industrial
centres. “Australia,” he said, “was eclipsed by the
great cities.” There is no need to be alarmed about
that.... Certainly the growth of the cities does not
and cannot prejudice the development of the interior.
It is the other way about, because every man earning
a living in the city helps to employ another in the
country producing things for his support, and thus
makes the path of the pioneer so much easier.
Pioneering work can go on in the middle of the
town as well as in the bush.

Crises in Uncle Samland and Germany,

Peru, ices in the Southern Ocean or the
Dago shops—all furnisli forth food for
the linotype and the rhinotype.
The possibility of sewage in the gigantic

Slump of Things !
Aunt ’Tilda asks foamingly each morn-
ing, “What do we Believe?” and regi-
ments of emaciated amateur controver-
sialists rise up and deploy in her
columns.
By-the-way, what DO we believe, came-
radosf
Do we believe that the men and women of
1814 were The Pioneers?
Or do we believe that the men and women
of 1914 are the Pioneers?
The men and women of 1814 discovered
things ; the men and women of 1914 are
to develop things.
George Reid declares that Australia is
eclipsed by the great cities.
I, Oliver Cromwell Cabot, declare that
Australia is eclipsed by the Great Bor-
rowing Policy of the great cities!
We cannot see Australia for the Bloated
Capitals; we cannot discern the Com-
monwealth for the flocks of Loans.
If a thing is not near Melbourne, it is no
good; if a thing is not near Sydney, it
is no d good ; if it has not been
built with Borrowed Money it is no
d good at all.
This is the Gospel of Hopeless Persons in
1914—the Persons who tell us that “the
growth of the great cities does not pre-
judice the development of the interior.”
What do we Believe, camerados? Do we
believe that?
If we cannot see the wood for the trees ; if
we cannot see Australia for the Big and
Bloated Capitals; what shall we do?
Let us get us an Axe—and a Big Axe,
camerados!
Let us hit the Hopeless Persons and the
Professional Bloaters in the neck; let
us chop the trees a bit, so as to let the
wood he seen!
Let us also get us also a Gun- —and a good
Gun, camerados!
Let us shoot some of the flocks of Loans, and
stick the Great Borrowing Policy up
against a wall!
The Pioneers of 1814 did not foresee the
Piowneers of 1914, believe me.
The arrival of that great plOUneer, Dago-
vich Toopopulos, who opened up the
vast Steakadeoyst Scrub in the City of
Ma was not contemplated by the Pio-
neers of 1814.
The heroic sacrifices of Patrick O’Noses,
the immortal plOUneer of Flemington,
were never dreamed of by the pioneers
of 1814.
No, no!
The founding of our glorious pawnitall in-
dustry, by the famous Brothers Isaac-
stein —possibly our grandest plOU-
neers—was a develonment of 1914 that
must have paralysed the pioneers of a
hundred years ago!
Yes, yes!
George Reid himself could never have anti-
cinated the intrepidity of our present
plOUneers — No-Yes-No !
Again, the pioi/neers of the great Agent-
General-and-Staff-Attached-Persons-Han-
gers-on-and-Do-little Industry in Loan-
don will claim their meed of recogni-
tion among out present-day plOUneers.
But what do we Believe?
Do we believe in it, or do we not, camerados?
Aunt ’Tilda clearly thinks we ought to,
because she says that “every man earn-
ing a living in the city... .makes the
path of the pioneer so much easier.”
It would, earner ados ; oh, it would!
Let us bloat, swell, distend, expand and—
hurst!

O. C. CABOT.
Sentimentality and the Criminal.
Randolph Bedford’s reflections :
A recent Bulletin par. which says: “One of the
inscrutable mysteries of woman’s character came out
in the case of Mrs. Newman,” might justifiably go
further and include man in the description. Mrs.
Newman could kill babies for gain and yet be Flor-
ence Nightingale without Florence’s theatrical-
ism. Mrs. Ivnorr’s business was baby-killing for
fees, miscalled “bonuses,” of £lO and upwards; yet
Mrs. Knorr, outside cof her business, was as kindly
and sympathetic and motherly a murderess as ever
wept over the deaths of Little Willie and Madame
Vine. Similarly, Deeming, to people who judged
superficially the new acquaintance—and they are
greatly in the majority—was a very pleasant, kindly
and tactful companion. After all, our horror is not
for crime, but for its manner; and in the ratio of
the secrecy and treachery of its commission, so is
the horror of it. It is for that reason that the
cowardly and secret murder of children seems to ex-
clude all humaneness from the perpetrator, so that
the discovery that the murderess was addicted to
porridge or some such other commonplace strikes
us as being at the least improbable.
Such an egoist as the natural criminal must be
in order to be a criminal, excludes his own specialty
from the list of crimes. The old lecher after youth
squares his crime with the honor that pays 20s. in
the pound; the dealer in adulterated groceries can
point to a long and vegetably-moral life in extenua-
tion of salicylates in the tomato sauce; and every
commercial and speculative criminal secures absolu-
tion —not only from himself, but from the commun-
ity—with the sacrament of success, just as every
failure can prove by his failure his morality. One
proves his ‘‘honor” by the evidence of his money;
the other proves his “honor” by the testimony of
his poverty Yet outside of this specialisation and
this “squaring” of the one inherent vice, all these
people may be quite human. Kindliness, the nursing
instinct, the “ministering angel thou when pain and
sickness wring the brow” are as characteristic of any
but the most perverted and ferocious criminals as
they are of the prostitute, many of them, like Trilby,
“with all the virtues but one.”
Says the best of Macbeth's cut-throats: —
“I am one, my lord,
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Have so incens'd that I am reckless what I do
To spite the world.”
These are not criminals in the real sense, because
they frankly know what they do. One true criminal
egoist, whom 1 knew, arrested red-handed for murder,
when asked in gaol, “What brought you here?”
answered, not “Murder!” but “Bad luck.” And who
will decry the honesty of perversion of the cashier
who had stolen regularly his £5OOO a year for five
years, and recoiled in horror from the spectacle of
the office boy in manipulating Is. 9d. of the petty
cash ?
Many years ago, as an entering clerk in a dry-
goods warehouse of the ripe age of 16, and at a
salary of £lO a month, I walked through the old
George-street Markets on a first of September, and
saw masses of native rose and flapnel-flower and an
advertisement of a Manly flower show. In that
moment the Spring raged in my blood and the bush
cried out to me to hate the city. At that busy time
—which is in the Rag Trade equivalent to the Sack
of Rome, the Discovery of America by Columbus,
and the Fall of Jerusalem —vacation by consent was
impossible. It had to be taken. In the entering
room I looked at a Mont Cenis of printed calico
miscalled “zephyr,” a great Dividing Range of
China matting, a Teneriffe of boxes of ruching, and
a Gibraltar of muslin and silk ; and I determined
on flight, not to escape work, which I have always
been fond of, but because the sun shone that day
and might not shine again. Bdt the war chest was
empty. I went to the cashier, accountant and
highly-respected treasurer; mentioned that a month’s
salary would be due me in three days, and asked for
a sovereign. After much demur, he gave me 10 per
cent, of my own money ; then he kept me changing
my weight from one leg to another in sheer nervous
fear of him while he told me I was heading in the
direction of the Pit, and that he that goeth not to
the Savings Bank o’ Saturdays and to the Tabernacle
o’ Sabbaths shall meet the magistrate o’ Tuesdays.
At last he dismissed me. and I cleared my file of
invoices in two hours and gave the Rag Palace leg-
bail and fled to Manly. It was an innocent day. I
had my own company, and dreamed dreams on the
big sandstone cliffs with the Pacific booming below,
and tried to make verses among the native roses out
by Narrabeen ; and I had three ice-creams and three
ginger-beers and two rides on a sleeping rotary pro-
pelled by a gloomy man, and called in joke a
“merry-go-round.” I went back to the calico pyra-
mids next day and worked double tides; but I was
carpeted by the trusty treasurer and talked at as
if I were guilty of simony, arson, piracy and murder
in the third degree, instead of a mere schoolboy
offence of “wagging it.” He told mq that now I
was at the critical position between the chancel and
the gallows; doomed now to be other one of the
Rogues’ Gallery or a saint in a stajitjed-glass window
—as if there were no middle course. But he gener-
ally impressed me with the belief that I was 90
per cent, original sin and the rest vacillation, while
he himself was of the only real and genuine com-
munion of saints. It affected me so deeply that
three months later I took the same sort of voluntary
and irresponsible holiday, and, being weary of rags,
anyhow, gave myself the sack. A few years later
the saint was arrested, in the sort of house saints
are supposed to avoid except when necessary to con-
vert the inmates. He had been robbing the firm for
years, and so ingeniously as to defy audit after
audit. Yet he was tremendously human ; so human
as to be able to extract much spiritual good from
the giving of advice he could not take himself. A
peculiarly criminal characteristic this—to be himself
old Mr. Bright’s disease while handing the kidney
medicine to Hercules. * . ...
And the conclusion of the whole matter is that
the detection of crime that starts out by putting the
criminal beyond the pale of humanness must nearly
always fail.

HUGH
GIBSON,
Specialist In the
Increase of
Height,
Department 123, Pitt St., Sydney, N.S.W.
like these hasty people to live up here behind the
bar.
In good times the bar is fairly straight (say as
straight as George-street at its curliest), fairly wide
(say as wide as Pitt-street at its narrowest, with
a stone breakwater on one side and a sand spit on
the other), iairly smooth and fairly deep (say Bft.
9in., with the vessel loaded down to 9ft.). Then,
with a good tide, a good head of steam, a good
skipper, a good loud curse, and a go'od slice of luck,
out she bumps, through the sand, thumping (say)
three times. The skipper then wipes his perspiring
brow, asks forgiveness for his language, cautiously
wriggles the wheel to see if his rudder is intact,
rings up the cussing engineer to ask if the pro-
peller is still there, and, all being well, starts the
long thrash against the southerly that always blows
when I’m a passenger for Sydney.
This is in good times. Just now, with no fresh
in the river and a long succession of north-easters,
the Nambucca bar has to be seen to be believed. For
you can easily see it. The crossing of the bar
becomes a succession of thrills. At the top of high
water, the coaster having wriggled over the “cross-
ing” or inner or sixpenny bar, takes the bit
between her teeth, so to speak, and takes the bar
proper. The skipper's plan is to plough through
the sand by main engine force before two things
can happen: (1) that the sand gets into the engines,
or (2) that the seas turn the vessel’s bow ever
so slightly and wash her up on to the hungry spit.
For weeks navigation on the Nambucca was like
this, but latterly this weird brand of navigation has
been impossible, so on January 8, the pilot and
30 volunteers pranced out on to the bar and dug a
channel through it. The scheme was for the pent-up
water inside to scour out a corridor wide enough to get
the dredge into. But this relief is only a make-shift,
as tons of sand are rolling in, with the weight of
the Pacific behind it, every tide. Meanwhile, our
fish, pigs and produce are missing the market, and
decaying before our eyes and under our noses, which
is worse. We are carting our very beer 20 miles,
and fresh meat and vegetables are not to be ob-
tained. These last-named don’t matter much, but
the beer problem is causing acute reflection.
I shouldn’t be surprised if somebody doesn’t hear
of Port Stephens some of these days. It is a real
port.
»
The Sydney “wharfies” lately started one of
their playful - strikes—at least it wasn’t
exactly a strike, but it was part of one. Some
time ago the existing agreement was thrown
overboard into the soup, and a new one was
arrived at which fixed the remuneration at
Is. 6d. per hour during ordinary working
time apd 2s. 3d. per hour overtime. The
other day it was suggested that this one
should also go into the soup—pretty nearly
all the agreements seem to go there —and
that the pay should be 2s. per hour ordinary
time and 3s. overtime. As the proposal
wasn’t immediately accepted, a curious sort
of semi-strike started. The wharf-lumping
business was to go on as usual during the
day, but no overtime at all to be worked. The
change came on Friday night when there is
a rush to load the numerous vessels which
quit on Saturday, and many a surprised
and haggard ship, which had a time-table
to live up to, fled out on Saturday partially
empty, leaving a heap of its cargo behind it
on the wharf. Ex-Attorne.v-General Hughes
is head of the Sydney Waterside Workers’
Association, and he rushed into the breach
on behalf of the existing agreement, but ap-
parently he was simply bidden to rush out
again. Because N.S.W. is allowed to use
only one port for all its foreign trade (apart
from coal) the Sydney wharfies can hang
up practically everything at short notice.
There is no waste of time negotiating for
the support of the men at big rival cities
on Jervis Bay or Twofold Bay or Port
Stephens. There is just one meeting, and
then a thud and a crash, and an anguished
Hughes remonstrating in the distance.
Vasco Loureiro, son of Melbourne’s well-
remembered brushman, is giving himself a
trip to Australia this summer. As a youth,
Loureiro was inclined to be unrobust, where-
fore he chose an open-air occupation—
sketching passengers on Port Phillip
steamers at a shilling a blob. The blobs
proved orofitable, and presently he took to
inter-State boats, where he charged a higher
fee. Successful beyond expectations, the
artist packed up his pencil and set forth to
conquer the world. He did it. At any rate,
he now has a pleasant bank-balance, apart
fripm the means to publish his book. “Around
tliq World on a Pencil,” due shortly.
Dunlop, the Victorian doubles champion
at tennis, who was just off to Europe to play
for the Davis Cup, lost his head badly after
the fire at “The Colosseum,” in which vast
fluffery he got a big interest through marry-
ing a daughter of the late Treadway, its
founder. There are few men who have mixed
more pleasure with their business, and no
doubt reckoned their business was all the
better for it, than Dunlop: and therein he
followed on the lines laid down by Tread-
way, who in his latter davs was in the habit
of handing round field-glasses to the men
chosen for Australian Elevens and such like.
Yet after the fire, Dunlop, exploding in the
Melbourne papers over the alleged effeteness
and general unsatisfaetoriness of the Fire
Brigade, made sarcastic remarks about the
prevalence of billiard tables at the fire-
stations. Whereupon Chief Officer Lee was
stirred up to say that if Dunlop’s firm hadn’t
been so infernally mean, and had employed a
temporary watchman while the regular hand
was off on leave, there most likely would
have been no fire at all for Dunlop to get
annoyed about.

George Dean, who used to be billed as
“the actor who can sing and the singer who
can act,” hasn’t been billed as anything for
some time past, owing to sickness. Dean
has appeared in most theatres in Australia,
under most managements, and friends who
think his has been hard mozzle are giving
him a “complimentary farewell” matinee at
the Little Theatre (Sydney) on Friday, the
oOth. The J.C.W., Willoughby, Fuller-
Brennan and other managements have per-
mitted their people to lend a hand, and it is
hoped that the cash-box will be full enough
to take the beneficiare to England, where
prospects for him are rosier.

“Monsieur Beaucaire,” revived at Sydney
Royal last Saturday, gives the departing
Lewis Waller the best chance he has had,
and he does so well that it is fortunate Julius
Knight, who was Beaucaire the First so far
as Australia is concerned, is now dealing in
Shaw and other dramatists. Not that Julius
wasn’t good, bu<t that Lewis is better. The
superiority of Waller is most noticeable in
the Djana-by-moonlight . love scene, where
the triumphing Beaucaire yearningly com-
mands the melting Mary to “Turn to me!”'
It is such a delicate passage that it becomes
painful _if r. stressed. Waller, with every
female in .the house hanging on his words
and ready 'to follow him through thick and
thin, mercifully glides over it. and thereby
earns the gratitude of every fidgeting male
in the audience. He is graceful throughout,
and acts with charm and sincerity, though
just a little careless with his dressing. Madge
Titheradge seems a trifle overweighted at
first. The uppish Lady Mary looms so large
in the text that she looks a hopeless job for
such a slight and willowy actress; but, as
the character softens (in the heart), the
clever Australienne takes hold. Frank
Woolfe, as the unscrupulous Duke of Winter-
set, is fairly raw. Almost every actor has
his mannerism,, and all villains (Woolfe’s
line of business is stage villainy) are more or

less alike ; but as the Duke he should have
tried to forget his favorite trick of showing
his teeth when foiled or baffled. After a
white-fanged snarl (British dukes hardly
ever snarl), the only thing left is the bark
and the bite. And there is no recorded case
of anyone having contracted hydrophobia
through being bitten by a duke. Recently a
Finnish sailor bit a. Sydney policeman’s foot
through the regulation boot; but he wasn’t
even a K.C.M.G. Halliwell Hobbes is a
chill, self-possessed Beau Nash and gets no
humor out of the part. Evelyn Beerbohm,
as Lord Townbrake, supplies a quietly natu-
ral and well-dressed, study of a gentle-
manly ass of the period. Charles Quarter-
maine, as ’the cheerful jßakell, works hard,
but is lacking in geniality. Lizette Parkes.
fresh and dainty as usual, is a welcome
Lucy Rellerton. Little Alec Thompson is
below his usual high average as the garru-
lous Bicksett; and Hilliard Vox, of the
strained voice, is sufficiently sinister as the
duellist Badger. Edmund Waller makes an
excellent Francois and a creditable Ambas-
sador. The play gets the crowd unmistak-
ably. It’s a pity Waller can’t restore a few
leaves to the wilting calendar and start all
over again with it.

Pinero’s “His House in Offler” has been
chosen by the Hugh Buckler Company for
its welcome reappearance at the Little
Theatre, Sydney, next Saturday.
There are no signs yet at the Sydney
Criterion of a fair deal with its audiences.
When in “Officer 666” Fred Niblo frankly
declares just before the curtain swoops down
that the whole thing has been a mere
theatrical fake—that such things couldn’t
have happened except on the stage—he does
not offer the audience its money back. And
some of the audience would rather like to
have it back. However, the fact that the
dramatist, admits that he has been writing
rot is a sign of grace. So many dramatists
don’t even know they are writing rot.

If it does nothing else, Gene Greene’s rag-
time competition at Sydney Tivoli shows
what asses some people are prepared to make
of themselves free of charge, and as far as
it has gone that’s about all it has done. The
Romano Bros., in a series of poses; the
Schmettans, equilibrists; and Reynolds and
Donegan, skaters, fill the hard-work section
of the bill; Gene Greene. Josephine Davis
and Gladys Gordon (whose singing would
“go” much better if the second voice, which
might belong to an unpaid landlady or a
revengeful _ mother-in-law were out of the
way) provide the more-or-less musical half.

Women’s proneness to pleasure and men’s
proneness to foot the bill are strikingly ex-
emplified at the White City (Sydney) these
nights. Any doubting philosopher is re-
quested to forward his name and address to
the manager of the pleasure-ground for
press-agency purposes.
The principal new turn at the National
this week is Brent Hayes, one of the great-
est current banjo players, whose skill will
stand beside that of A. D. Cammeyer, A. II
Kennedy, Parke Jlunter, Joe Morley and
other of the celebrateds. Dorothy Harris,
the Rosa Valerio Sextette, the Ginger Girls,
Ray Lawrence and the 10 maniac bulldogs
are all going strong—especially the de-
moniacal bull-hounds.

The tango craze has wormed its way into
‘A Day at the Races” at the Palace (Syd-
ney). This week the co. has been illustrat-
ing how the dance, body-lock, or whatever it
is, originated, was developed and reached its
present stage. Thus another great problem
is solved, and the income-tax-payers’ union
can get back to work.
The seven people in Sydney who have not
yet seen the pantomime, “Aladdin,” at the
Adelphi, are urged to go along without delay
so that Statistician George Willoughby may
close the records.
The best at Sydney theatres this
week: —
Crystal Palace: “House of Discord.” This is
one of the A. B. Co.’s special domestic dramas with a
moral lesson. The moral lesson has been taught
before, but no moral lesson can be taught too often.
In time somebody is bound to be impressed. Even
the Ten Commandments have a chance.
Lyric : “The Convent Gate.” The story of a girl
who, being abandoned by her lover, flees for refuge
to a convent, but on explanation, flees back to her
lover, and is married. Moral: Some people are never
satisfied.
Colonial: “The Chinese Death Thorn.” This is a
5000 ft. film exposing the evils of the opium craze.
All opium fiends are offered a reduction at the doors
on presenting cards of membership to three accredited
poppy joints at Potts Point.
Empress: “The Test.” An up-to-date or bunny-
hug version of the Garden of Eden. Caste: Adam, a
doctor of medicine, too attentive to his job ; Eve, a
neglected wife; the co-re. with the cloven purpose,
a military officer. The story begins in the usual
way, and ends in the ordinary manner. A fair ner-
centage of the audience will, therefore, be able to
judge its accuracy for themselves.
Glaciarium and Olympia (West’s): “Out on the
Deep. Good story with a big shipwreck scene.
Lyceum (Spencers): “Between'Man and Beast"
being a series of hair-trigger adventures with the
wild parishioners of the jungle.
Imperial: A dozen of them.
The revue is still booming at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney). Some nights it booms
rather more uproariously than it does on
other nights, but the disturbance occasioned
by its triumph is invariably audible at least
aJblock or two away, which is all a reason-
able show can demand.
In Adelaide, the King’s has been enjoying
itself immensely, with both Royal and Tivoli
closed. Manager Muller has had three first-
in-Australia turns to show. Foster Lamont
and Foster are “iron-jawed.” In these days
of rickety artificial molars, it is refreshing
(or uncomfortable, according to individual
fancy) to see an athlete doing violent turns
on a rope suspended solely from her com-
panions’ teeth; and they bite just as well
when their owners are upside-down or cor-
ner-ways. The Nell Elsing Co. does a
“sketch” of American sentimentality, set
among wharf-loafers who call girl “goil,”
and say “sure t’ing” for Yes. There is one
pretty touch. On Thanksgiving Day they
take stock of what they have to be thankful
for. The sole asset is one large onion—
except that the boy has his goil. Then she
is snatched away (entirely for her own
good) to a Home. So the boy brings out the
onion, and unconventionally, as man to man,
thanks his Creator for that. (Curtain.)
So far, Miss Elsing has had fewer chances
than an unnamed male companion. As for
the Trovatore Trio, they do not show suffi-
cient cause why they were brought all the
way from the U.S.A. Still a change in
their turn after the first three nights was
an improvement. The Mclntosh has de-
scended upon Adelaide, and instigated
manager Crawford into transferring the
whole Tivoli show to the Oval. Brans-
combe’s Dandies, also in the open, continue
to be a gold-mine. With every Cricket
Association member having the right to ad-
mission for himself and two ladies, there
should be no lack of attendance at
Mclntosh’s show, anyway. Pictures—
West’s, Wondergrapli. Pav., Empire and
others—vary from “Moths” and “Butter-
fly,” which have no connection with each
other, to the true method of dancing a
Tango.
At Melbourne Royal the end of the first
week of “Diplomacy” was the beginning of
Last Nights. The highly theatrical comedy,
recently revived in London after a lapse of
three dozen years, is not showing cause for
its re-introduction to Australia. Miss Grace •
Noble has changed her outfit for the final
scene, and the pronunciations of foreign lan-
guages—French and Spanish—by certain
members of the co, are less suggestive of a
Cook’s Excursion than their previous ac-
cents, but the falseness of the plot and fool-
ishness of everybody engaged in diplomatic
service remains as glaring as before. The
young man who leaves his important des-
patch-box lying around whilst his bride has
charge of the key; the elder brother who
passes this carelessness without comment;
the scheming Baron who becomes suddenly
unsuspicious and amenable to “bounce,” and
finally the Countess, who will confess any-
thing in order to get possession of one par-
ticular letter, as though the holder of the
alleged letter (which turns out to be a blank
sheet of paper) couldn’t have obtained
plenty of duplicates thereof —all these
people are simpletons in diplomatic clothing.
Quite apart from the incidents of the stolen
paper and the purloined photo., the personal
appearance of the Countess (in this produc-
tion) invites contempt for the perspicacity
of all persons concerned. She strikes atti-
tudes of guilt wherever she goes, but all the
decent diplomatic people trust her implicitly,
except Henry Beauclerc, who appears to be
unfavorably impressed when they first meet,
but never thinks of suspecting her during
the next two acts. As for Baron Stein, he
regards the lurid Countess as the most
artful confidence woman on earth. She is
his belle ideal of a secret paper-chaser.
Whereas he ought to say to her: “My dear
Zicka. in your existing form you are im-
possible. Change your style, and try to
look innocent,” he kisses her scented hand
and calls her a great diplomatist. “Dip-
lomacy” is heartless, refined melodrama, ap-
pealing only to an intelligent audience’s
sense of improbability. No character in the
piece is worth the cheers, tears or groans of
an unsophisticated gallery. The heroine and
her mother are a pair of wandering im-
pecuniosities who cheat the jeweller and the '
laundry, whilst the young man who marries
into their disrespectable family is disposed
to cheat the barber.

Big-chief Great Storm will make no more
horrible noises at Melbourne Princess’s after
Friday. In weather less unfavorable to
theatre-going the management might have
exploited “The Pride of the Prairie” for
another week, but now is January, and the
demand for cowboy-cwm-Indian has consid-
erably abated. It makes a bloke hot even
to look at a cowboy in his sheepskin-

his back. Perhaps the new attraction
announced for Saturday will be a nice
eool bellowdrama with snow about,
where pale moonbeams are reflected in
a peaceful stream, and church bells
chime out upon the frosty air. Its
title is “The Soldier’s Wedding,” and the
last nights of the season are dedicated to

The panto, at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne)
is the same money-making concern that
ever it was. Ali Baba Lupino and Edwin
Brett, wife of the above, are still keeping
up their end of the frivolity, which is the
thick end. Marie Eaton and the Forty
Thieves continue to store their stolen pro-
perty in a cave instead of getting rich on
it, and the vivacity of the many-legged
su PPorts Ganem in the refrain
of My Southern Maid” is beautiful to con-
template.
Recent additions to the second act of “The
Land of Nod” (Melbourne King’s) are an
improvement. Judging from the matinee
attendances, Anderson’s nondescript show
appears to be pretty much of a panto for
the young. Children are interested in April
I 001, the Man in the Moon and the King of
Hearts, and their views concerning jokes are
very liberal, as a rule. Also, they have been
so carefully instructed in the majesty of
their Gracious King that they feel almost
excited when a mild impersonator of George
V. pops up in a stage box to receive their
homage.

The Melbourne Opera House programme
was considerably enriched by two new items
on Saturday. Hawley & Co., who play “The
Bandit” at high pressure, are two men and
a lady, and their lightning playlet in half-
an-act is charged with cries of rage, horror
and despair. The plot suggests two old
Italian opera stories boiled down to 20 min-
utes. If either of the three performers—
one of whom figures as a dumb maniac or a
speechless nightmare—were to stop to sneeze
the spell would be broken and the house
would fall into a fit of laughter. But they
rush through to the gruesome end without a
pause. Hawley, in the name part, defeats
the game little lady by a long neck, with the
raging maniac two lengths away. Clemons
and Dean are dancers who can sing and
act. The male partner (Clemons presum-
ably) does a dance of inebriation which is
quite wonderful and wholly humorous. Noth-
ing so quaintly effective has “knocked” a
Melbourne audience since the late Johnny
Coleman introduced his “Scarecrow” nov-
elty. The lady also dances joyously, and
their rendering of ragtime coon songs—
especially “You Made Me Love You”—leaves
de niggahs beaten at their own game. Many
other white folk have been dealing with the
same colored ditty of late, but it remained
for Clemons and Dean to explain what the
other people were singing at.

At West’s., Melbourne, last Saturday,
“Salvation Sal” required a few hundred
feet of moving picture to reform a tough
called Red McGee. “Red” was ruddv in
language and worse in habits, but Sal ‘took
him in hand, and by hard preaching and
praying made him the envy of the local
Y.M.C.A. “A Cause for Thankfulness,” also
at West’s, demonstrated how Pride fell in a
railway accident, while “Between Man and
Beast” described how a Dago was pressed
to become a tiger’s breakfast.
AT POVERTY POINT.
8.0. : Olga Netliersole has been telling the Fog-
town press that she, and not Mrs. Pat Campbell, was
first selected to play Paula in “The Second Mrs.
Janqueray. According to Olga, Pinero wrote the
pJay for John Hare, who was to “create” Cayley
Brummie, with Forbes-Robertson as Aubrey Tank, anil
Ole'll as.tije lady with whom he strayed to the altar.
Hut Hare got a hundred cold feet about the play,
so Pinero took it from him and submitted it to
George Alexander. Although he reckoned the thing
ri / k y> Alexander, when faced with the sudden need
- on some thing in place of “Liberty Hall,”
decided to try “Tanqueray” as a stopgap. Both pro-
ducer and dramatist, Olga alleges, wanted her for
i aula; but Hare, with whom she was appearing,
refused to release her. So Mrs. Pat was offered what
was to prove her most successful part. How these
mummeresses love one another!
t’ercy Grainger has had a remarkable experience in
Berlin His lively “Shepherds, Hey!” which has
achieved considerable popularity in England, was
played by an orchestra at a concert in the German
capital. One section of the audience (anti-Bull, per-
haps) hissed, while the other lot applauded. The
latter insisted on an encore, and the golden-headed
Australian s vivacious number was repeated. London
IELfiGRAPH, commenting on the affair, says Percy
is the first composer born under the British flag
to enjoy the distinction of being hissed in Berlin”
and guesses from it that he is “attaining greatness!”
From London: Once more Hammerstein’s gorgeous
Opera House had to put up the shutters suddenly
owing to lack of public support.” A “Society Cir-
cus was occupying its stage at the time, but neither
n °£ low society turned up in payable quanti-
ties, fhe people who were trying to run the circus
blamed the S.P.C.A., the Dogs’ Defence League and
other objectors to animal performances, who “worked

dFh man P not *?, ln ’”, Tt is announced that

' Tbis revue , business of persons
arising from the audience and taking part in the
of°otw n& J~ a r - evi y a } of the traditional circus stunt
of other days—is being overdone. A friend and I
were yawning through a Melbourne revue possessing
ab th \ scintillating qualities of a sheet of blotting
paper, but were denied the blessed privilege of entirefy

f” then somebody or other in our vicinity would get

me. I mentioned to Her my suspicion that, with

happily married, we were the only persons in the

jSbe a f reed - , So wroth were we at not being
incduded in the paysheet that we rose era masse and
. Down to our own times, actors were in the
habit of wearing their hair long, but the custom is
now out of fashion. Henry Irving was one of the
last to stick to it religiously. At the annual dinner
of the Actors Benevolent Fund in London, Henry
Ainley, who recites Adam Lindsay Gordon better than
any other man in England, incidentally alluded to
, oust 0 ” 1 , and gave his theory as to its origin.
It dates, die said, from the Dark Ages, when actors
were legally classed with “rogues and vagabonds.” An
actor in those times when caught had his ears
pierced by an official of the local authority as a
present punishment and an abiding mark for future
identification. By wearing the hair long and well
over the ears, actors were able to conceal their con-
victions from inconvenient observers.
The Australasian Moving Picture Annual, edited
by Fred Samson and printed by Syd. Day in Mel-
bourne, is a better thing of its kind than most of
the English and American theatrical sixpennies that
come this way. Two or three stories are bright
reading, and the portraits of leading cinematograph
mummers are more interesting than the old, familiar
photos of the musical-comedy girls, who seem to
have only one smile among the lot of them. The
picture-actor nowadays has a wider circle of
adorers than the most beauteous of talking mum-
mers. Samson estimates the weekly attendance at
various picture shows in Sydney and Melbourne
alone at something more than 350,000 a week.
“0.K.”: The late Cuyler Hastings is hummed up
by “Bloggs” as “an indifferent actor, with a splen-
did stage personality and an attractive stage appear-
ance.” Well, Hastings lacked the suavity and the
mechanical tricks of technique which are necessary
to what is known as “a good actor” in the mum-
mer trade. But, from the general public’s point of
view and understanding, he was a capital actor,
because he held an audience’s attention in a master-
ful manner, and was gifted with a fine, musical
magnetic voice. His appearance, to my way of
thinking, was coldly pleasing, rather than attrac-
tive. But his voice ! It has fixed upon my memory
three or four of the scenes in which he figured-
notably the corpse scene in the first act of “Sunday,”
and the scene in “The Admirable Crichton,” where
the gunboat comes to the island and the butler real-
the fact that his reign has ended. I think the
voice of Cuyler Hastings was the finest I ever heard.
From London: Alec Hurley turns out to have
been only a little over 40, or younger than his
(legal) widow, Marie Lloyd. Margaret Cooper, at
the piano, has brought herself right up to date
with a satirical song, “In My Revue.” The sultry
“Saplio” has been filmed. The picture-version, hav-
ing passed the British censor, is innocuous and
rather dull. A whole week of Suffragette propa-
ganda drama has been given at the Coronet. Strange
to say, the propagandists relied on foreign work,
translations from Bjornson and Brieux. The latter
author was present in person. Horace Hodges, who
was in Australia with Wilson Barrett, has a fat
part as Chauvelin in Fred Terry’s revival of “The
Scarlet Pimpernel.” Edward Lauri is running the
tango Teas at the Pavilion—half a crown for tea,
sandwiches and various dances, and an undress
parade of_ milliner’s models in corsets and other
underclothing. And old Teddy Royce, who was in
Australia long ago, and was 72 last birthday, has dis-
tinguished himself by playing the burglar in “Sealed
Orders” (the big Drury Lane melodrama), with a
shoulder that had been dislocated just before the
curtain rose.
“M.L.”: “First Nighter” (B. 8/l/’l4) puts up
straw men to knock them down again. I have no
hatred for highballs and Manhattans and “old rye
with a chase” (which he couldn’t even quote cor-
rectly). I gave these trimmings as one reason why
the revue would be likely to continue popular in
America and a comparative failure in Australia—a
contention which even the crowded business of a
few weeks does not disprove. For the rest, I am
so un-English that it was just the English tolera-
tion of the peculiar morality of the English public-
school that I objected to. “First Nighter” tells
some interesting stories of a buck nigger in ’Frisco
before the fire, and of the habits of the immigrant
cook in a house where, presumably, and to judge
from the writings of him, he is under-fobtman or
bellboy. And I don’t call ladies who sit, one on
each knee, of a nigger “lost women” (except that
they may be lost to all sense of smell), but I do call
“First Nighter” a wandering ass. But why all
“First Nighter’s” ferocious abuse, following on mere
differences of opinion! I’ve been too long at this
game of pen-and-ink to use The Bulletin that I
may play Slurk to the Potts of a small, irritable
amateur.
“Harrison O.”: What is “Private Boxer” giving us
when he alleges (B. 8/1/’l4) that Shaw “never was
a dramatist” ? The very first act of “Man and Super-
man”—probably all of Shaw that “Private Boxer”
knows aught about —presents Violet, whom all had
looked upon as a brazen hussy living in “sin,” as
a respectable married female. Isn’t this dramatic?
Furthermore, what about the triangular scene in
the last act of “Candida,” the second act of “Arms
and the Man,” much of “Captain Brassbound’s Con-
version,” and almost the whole of “The Devil’s
Disciple” ?, Anyone who asks for anything more
dramatic than the scene in the parson’s house, and
the subsequent trial and the scene on the scaffold in
“The Devil’s Disciple,” must be suffering from a
comatose artistic perception and a rush of ennui to
the head.
An interesting par. from Melbourne Herald: —
“When ‘Diplomacy’ was produced at the Theatre
Royal on Saturday night there was present in the
audience a resident of South Yarra, Mr. Ernest E.
Keep, who witnessed the first production of Sardou’s
play at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London, by
the Bancrofts in 1878. Mr. Keep was struck by
the marked resemblance between Sir Squire Ban-
croft’s and Mr. Julius Knight’s conceptions of the
part of Henry Beauclerc.”
This is interesting for the , reason that the South
Yarra citizen is presented as a typical old playgoer
who professes to have retained a vivid, not a vague,
recollection of theatrical performances which hap-
pened in the dim past, though it is questionable
whether the most educated memories can accurately
re-picture any passing form of entertainment after
an interval of 20 years. (Making due allowance
for the fact that impressions formed in the age of
enthusiasm are the most enduring.) The supposed
recollection in this case is a doubly humorous de-
lusion. Bancroft’s methods in any character were
essentially different from Julius Knight’s. Moreover,
Knight as Henry Beauclerc is not playing Bancroft’s
original part. The tall, slim “society” comedian
played Count Orloff, whilst John Clayton was the
Henry Beauclerc now “conceived” by Julius Knight.
“Diplomacy” had a notable cast for'its first produc-
tion in London. Mrs. and Mr. Kendal were the
young lovers, John Clayton the elder Beauclerc and
Bancroft the Count Orloff. Mrs. Bancroft was Count-
ess Zicka, and Arthur Cecil identified himself with
the part of Baron Stein. Apropos of Arthur Cecil’s
performance the Saturday Review said: “The ad-
mirable acting, on the whole, of the piece more than
atones for the faults of the adaptation.”
“C. Ockney”: A slip of the “W. V. Penn” surely
causes that Poverty Pointer to allude (B. 8/l/’l4)
to Arthur Roberts’s old-time production of “Gentle-
man Joe” as a “burlesque.” As a matter of fact it
was one of a series of bright little musical comedies
(“The French Maid” was the first) written by Basil
Hood and put into music by Walter Slaughter, and
was far more deserving of the title than the elab-
orate Daly and Gaiety pieces for which a string of
six or seven authors and composers were responsible.
Roberts was (and is) facile princeps as a burlesque
comedian; but he could give a genuine artistic
character performance whenever called upon, and his
“Gentleman Joe, the Hansom Cabby, M although
screamingly funny, was far removed from burlesque.'
Slaughter, the composer (of sugary “Dear Home-
land’’ fame), is dead long since; but the librettist.
Hood, an ex-military man, is still going as strong
as ever in London. He is the author of the “book”
of the latest Robert Courtneidge “hit,” “The Pearl
Girl,” at the Shaftesbury.
J. M. Synge’s “Playboy of the Western World,”
which has had tumultuous experiences in Ireland and
America, was lately at Liverpool (England), WhdFe
a number of the “bhoys” had to be thrown out of
the theatre for protesting both with voices and
missiles. The dramatic critic of the .Times and
many literary authorities consider the play a
dramatic masterpiece; but there are some I rish f
men who won’t see in it anything but an attempt to
smirch the fair fame of the women of their country.
After a couple of rowdy performances in Liverpool,
the police shut down on the show in the interests of
lawnorder; whereupon W. B. Yeats, poet, dramatist
and intimate friend of the late Synge, writes a letter
of protest in the Times, demanding of the police,
not that they suppress a play which a few noisy
rioters don’t understand, but that they protect its
performance until the proper authority declares it
unfit for presentation. ''
The position of the theatre orchestrians is hardly
as strong as that of the stage hand#.“ The time is
coming when all the music required for an ordinary
drama or comedy performance will be obtainable per
gramophone. Picture shows are almost certain to
utilise the funnel-graph in conjunction with the filmo-
graph. The performance will never be truly har-
monious until the audible, like the visible, part of it
is worked by machinery.
If any man has earned a rest for the re-
mainder of his life it is John Lomas, secre-
tary of the Maoriland Labor Department,
who has retired on the age limit. He started
to toil at seven years of age in the potteries
at Hanly (Eng.), and has been toiling and
even moiling ever since. In those good old
times he, with hundreds of other infants,
worked twelve hours a day for one shilling
a week. After a year of that the boy was
considered sufficiently grown to work as a
trucker in the mines, and, in return for the
sweat of his small body, was paid’sixpence a
day. As a young man he arrived in Maori-
land under contract to mine for the West-
port Coal Co., and was in one pit and an-
other until the ’9O strike. That threw him
out of employment, but just when he was on
the point of returning to Britain, W. P.
Reeves (then Minister for Labor) appointed
him to the newly-formed Labor Department,
under Edward Tregear. Lomas rose gradu-
ally by conscientious ability until, in 1911,
after 20 years’ service, he succeeded Tregear,
on that officer’s retirement, as chief.
The F.L.S. (Fellow of the Linnsean
Society) is something of a rare bird in Aus-
tralia. Edward Pescott, lately hatched into
one of them from the shell of plain citizen-
ship, is the principal of Burnley (Vic.)
School of Horticulture. For long years
this Government job was held by Bogue
Huffman, who _ wrote “A Vagabond in
Spain” after doing the vagabonding in per-
son. Pescott, originally a State-school
teacher, for a decade acted as inspector in
the employ of the Agricultural Department.
When Huffman was somewhat rudely lifted
out of his comfortable quarters at Burnley,
bitterly protesting, Pescott was regarded as
the. right person for the billet, and got it.
It is a pleasant job, in a land flowing with
milk, honey, poultry, pickled fruits and prize
vegetables. It seems probable that, even
prior to his new-found happiness in be-
coming an F.L.S., Pescott enjoyed life as
well as most special-billet Government: ser-
vants, and a lot better than those who heave
soil about without reference to the horti-
cultural possibilities thereof.
Pp e of the funniest items of the Victorian
Ministerial bv-elections was the violent in-
dignation of Minister Hagelthorn that his
private business should be made a matter of
public concern. Publicly Hagelthorn bar-
racks for the Watt immigration policy, but,
m his private business of land agent, he,
as Opposition-leader Elmslie put it, “flooded
the Wimmera with circulars setting forth
the advantages of N. S. Wales for land set-
tlement as against Victoria.” Hagelthorn
is only doing what he is legally entitled to
do; the fault lies with the people who em-
ploy him as Minister and M.L.C. No man
—even the broad-minded Hagelthorn him-
self would long employ a fire insurance
agent, for instance, after he had accepted a
scat on tlie board of a rival concern.

1847, coming to Adelaide as medical officer of an
emigrant ship. He passed along to Port Phillip, but
three or four years later he returned to Maoriland,
and stayed there until he was 96, at which respectable
age he passed out. Hocfgkinson was unique in his
experiences. He was the only man under the sun

THE NOISE MERCHANTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The theatre musicians’ strike is mainly for extra
pay, but another point in which there is a varia-
tion from the log relates to the playing of selec-
tions while audiences are leaving the building. The
musicians’ union is insisting that no music excepting
the National Anthem shall be played after the curtain
has been finally lowered.
The union of noise-merchants puts a new command-
ment out:
“Thou shalt not learn new music for to play the
audience out ;
“Thou shalt not send the people home to music glad
and gay,
Hut with the well-known dirge destroy the good
work of the play.
“The Union of Noise Merchants shall not learn a
new refrain,
But make from Christmas to the Cup that awful
row again.
“They shall not suffer any new ‘Omph-ha’s’ from the
trombone, .
But with-, the old Anathema .shall undermine the
throne.
“They shall not play a march to make the going
audience glad,
But with the dreary German hymn drive stalls and
circle mad.
The blighter with the piccolo shall make the welkin
ring,
Ihe drum shall beat andante in that curse, ‘Gor’
Savejfthe King.’
‘Until the populace in wrath takes back some' of its
own
By chasipg a musician till he hides in the trombone.”
And we’ll fill the hole with concrete to provide a
brassy tomb
tor the lone, deaf ruffian who thus blindly rushes on
his doom.

MABEL.: “ Did I see you coming out of an hotel
last night, George?”
GEORGE: "No; but you might have seen me
going IN.”
The Tinline Scholarships, given by Judge
Murray to Adelaide University in memory
of his maternal grandfather, are designed to
encourage students to dig among the musty
old records of Australian early-days. He
(or she —the prize has been won four times
by girl-graduates and only twice by men)
gets £3O on selecting a subject, and another
£3O on weighing-in with a satisfactory essay
on it. Each of the scholars so far has been
recommended to take five or 10 years of the
early history of South Australia, and un-
earth everything that can possibly be dug
up about the brief period. The result is
going to be, eventually, a very complete his-
tory of the State, laden with a vast amount
of very dull detail that isn’t worth bothering
about.
The usual parson lias been making the
usual wholesale charges of iniquity -against
Port Adelaide this time. It is another Go-
morrah, according to the sermon ot Lionel
Fletcher, with rampant drunkenness and
immorality a-nd a two-up school, attended
by 500 people, where children are taught to
play. The usual howl of contradiction fol-
lowed, with the usual complete failure of
the attacker to give definite instances when
called on for them. At last Attorney-Gene-
ral llomburg took the unusual course of
patrolling the Port himself one hot night,
and found all things “quiet and orderly.”
The police report that it is “one of the best-
conducted seaports in the Commonwealth.
There are a small number of bookmakers,
but they receive no quarter from the police.
There are no brothels, and no common prosti-
tutes on the street. The last two that were
before the Court were from Adelaide.” I
am not aware of the gambling-school where
the 500 meet, and I would be very thankful
to the rev. gentleman if he would let me
know where it is situated,” says the boss
policeman. Of course there was no re-
sponse. Of Fletcher’s good intentions there
is no doubt; but the parson, in any matter
that needs proof, seems to suffer from his
professional training, which (1) Assures
him that he must believe, and must get
others to believe, things that are simply in-
capable of proof; (2) Ensures him an'un-
interrupted, uncontradicted hearing for any-
thing whatever he may say. Thus, when
he bumps up against a cold world that says
“Whaffor?” and “Prove it!” he at once gets
disqualified on a foul, and seems dishonest
when he was in reality only reckless.
“The Old Soldier”: The following aston-
ishing item was cabled to Australia a day or
so ago :
The Maharaja of Burdwan demanded a searching
inquiry into the S’African coolie scandal. LotU
Crewe’s speech, he said, had given some hope; but
till something was done the feeling in India must
remain bitter. He urged retaliation by repatriating
every Indian.
The person who made that
speech is not, as. might be
supposed from his title, a
great ruling chief. He is
simply one who has become
fabulously rich from the
profits made out of his
business as a “Zemindar,”
or agent for the collection
of land-tax from the culti-
vators of the old Subadari
of Bengal. When the
British first had that Pro-
vince handed over to them
to administer, they were in
a difficulty, and they were
only too glad to lease the
tax-collecting to any native
agents who had done the
work, or said they had, for former
murky rulers. When Governor-
General- Cornwallis came on the
scene, he thought it would make
things better to give the agents a
“Permanent Settlement” —that is,
to make the Zemindars’ emolument
a fixed annual amount payable for
ever, while they had the right to
make the cultivators pay anything
they chose for rent, which is really
what land-tax means in that part
of the world. The Maharaja of
Burdwan, then, is permanent lease-
holder of a large area of land which
he holds from the Government at a
fixed rent, and sublets to the cul-
tivators at much higher rents. It
is not easy to see what he is to
get out of this agitation. He has
no traditional standing in Bengal,
and if the British are ever driven
out of India one of the first things
that will happen will be his expul-
sion, and that of all the Permanent
Settlement Zemindars of Bengal.
It is astonishing that anyone in
his position should have ventured
to use such language, and the out-
break can only be accounted for
on the supposition that recent
legislation has greatly reduced the
value of the Permanent Settlement, and the
rack-renting powers of Zemindars under it
—a type of reform that has occurred often
in the past.
N.S.W. Navigation Department, waking
up suddenly, has found out that it can, if it
likes, regulate and supervise motor-boats
and motor-launches that ply for hire. For
14 years the Department has hugged the
view that the Legislature wasn’t thinking
of motor-driven vessels when it passed the
present Act; and as everybody has been too
tired to pass any more Acts about a matter
Tike this with no votes in it, the Department
left the public which patronises motor-boats
to Providence. Lately the papers have been
full of reports of accidents and prognostica-
tions of others; and, realising that Provi-
dence wasn’t taking on the job seriously,
the Department of Navigation has an-
nounced that it has the power to compel
motor-boats to take ordinary precautions,
and, what is more, is going to see that they
are taken. As nothing has been added to its old
Act, either the marine authorities have been
very obtuse all these years, or they are put-
ting up a bluff on the motor-boats now.
THE RETORT CAUSTIC.
HE (an efficient bore): “Don't you, ah, think that women who imitate men make feahful
asses of themselves?"
SHE (bored): “Yes, if the imitation is perfect”
There is little chance for kecrecy in “wire-
less” messages when any schoolboy can erbet
a listening station in the back yard at a
cost of about 7s. 4id. One night recently
a small boy who had his station away down
at the southern end of the Great Loan
Land “tapped” a message sent from a M.L.
high-power station by one of Massey’s Cabi-
net to the skipper of a big immigrant ship
that was approaching the Maoriland coast.
Marconi’s magic had been called into use by
the harassed Minister to implore the skipper
of the immigrant boat to pick him a good-
looking cook !
Charity organisations again! A Laun-
ceston (Tas.) catmittee which runs a sort
of Home for Orphans recently declined the
usual Christmas oiler of a number of citizens
to take the youngsters on a holiday trip.
The charitable ladies gave as a reason for
rejecting the kindly offer that holiday picnics
were not good “for children who were being
brought up as servants.” Apparently the
Tasmanian servant handmaiden is expected
to have a dreary time, like Martha, who
was worn to a shadow with much serving
in a lean-to at Bethlehem.
The Hebrews of Victoria are seething like
the inmates of an over-stocked hornets’ nest
because Watt’s Immigration Department
cabled recently to its London agent not to
send out any more Jewish boys as assisted
immigrants. The State has openings only
for actual and prospective farmers and
farm laborers, and the Jew—at least the
Western European Jew —does not as a rule
make any violent rush to go on the land.
The Russian, Polish or Austrian Yid is a
sort of hereditary farmer, but his cousin of
Whitechapel and other crowded Cold Coun-
try centres prefers to till the soil where old
clo’ and jewellery grow, and plough the pad-
dock of the three brass balls, and put the
quadruped out to agistment.
These industries are already well represented
in Australia, but the exasperated descendant
of Moses won’t realise it. Hence the seeth-
ing condition above-mentioned.

BERLIN, January 13. —The Emperor’s physicians

a cure for stoutness. His Majesty is engaged in
sawing wood in the gardens at Potsdam, and chop-
ping it into suitable sizes for the stoves. The
gardener who is assisting gets the wood the Emperor
chops as wages.

times in succession): “It is the object,
Hans: it is small, is it not? ”

dend): “Yes, your Majesty, painfully so."

“Croson”: The Doncaster (Vic.) Tower
is gone—slain by the ruthless hand of the
knacker. About 40 years ago Hans or
Harry Hummell, a Melbourne wood-carter,
came into money. He settled some of it on
his wife. With the rest lie built a wooden
tower on the south side of the Doncaster
main road, at the crown of the big bill, and
invited Melbourne generally to drive out and
view his work. Melbourne responded cordi-
ally—for about 12 months —when a gale
capsized the contraption. Hummell removed
the debris and put up another look-out a
few yards further west, and six months
later the wind duly upended it. The
ex-wood-carter had a trifle of cash left and
unlimited pluck, and this time he crossed
the road and erected the rig-out that has
stood the storms of 38 years. Had he used
native timber —there are still a few red-
gum giants standing a few miles away—
his monument might have lasted a few hun-
dred years; but he employed pine, stayed it
with wire guy ropes, and of late the '23oft.
of framework threatened to topple down
headlong. Hummell passed out a few years
ago in Collingwood.

“Lifebelt”: Curious what tbin hairs the
Law is called upon to split. The Americans
who want £2,600,000 compensation from the
Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. for relatives
drowned in the Titanic argue that, in the
eyes of the law, the big ship now at the
bottom of the sea was a floating island fly-
ing the British flag, and, therefore,
amenable to British law. Under the U.S.
Admiralty laws, the claims would be limited
to salvage and passage money—a mere
trifle of £lB,OOO. Of course, the desperate
co. wants to have it that way. Meanwhile,
the “island” is gone where even the blessed
eye of the law can’t see it. Wonder if it
occurred to any travelling lawyer, on that
icy, boatless morning, as he waited glumly
for the last terrific plunge, that (in the
eyes of the law) lie was standing on British
ground? And if he did, was it any comfort:
to him?
The officers of Victoria’s Board of Public
Health professed themselves amused lately,
when a lady rang them up, stated that she
and her husband proposed to make holiday
at a certain country town, and inquired as
to the sanitary conditions of its - leading
hotel. Being told that the Board knew
nothing about such matters, she curtly in-
quired what the Plank was for if not to
inform people whether holiday houses were
conducted according to the rules of hygiene,
and rang off. Jt was mean of her to snatch
the last word thus brusquely, yet she was
entitled to it. The thorough inspection and
regulation of hotels should be one of the
early duties of any body allegedly charged
with looking after public health. Probably
not one-tenth of the hotels, coffee palaces,
restaurants and boarding-houses in the State
fulfil proper sanitary conditions, and if the
vast ma-joritv of private houses were over-
hauled likewise, the health of the public
would be advantaged. Public health isn’t
merely a matter of segregating small-pox
patients or testing milk supplies. But what
results can be expected ■ from a body that

“Mil”.: Melbourne Age, having suppressed

of cost as it did the
Defence system. “A
Queensland Grazing
Farmer” is the author
of these last attacks,
and his wild generali-
ties about a country
four or five times the'
size of France leads:
to the belief that when,
in Queensland this
grazing farmer grazes
on thistles. To argue
of the Territory and
all its administration
from a little know-
ledge of the ridiculous
Government farm on
the Daly River, or a
study of the habits of
Gilruth, is silly and
unfair. The farmer
who would judge of a.
stack of hay by a
grain of chaff has a
great deal to say of'
the ill-treatment of the
aborigines. Yet if'
there is one thing in
the Territory that has
justified the Common-
wealth it is the im-
provement in the con-
dition of the natives.
So good has been the>
work of the Protec-

the old hands who

and probably entered
the ear of the Queens-
land thistle-grazier.

as that of the Protec-
tors of Aborigines,.

stances it must be.

'The necessity for providing elderly vag-

out of “quod” was suggested by the case of
■Julia Hansen, aged 67, who stated her griev-
ance to Melbourne City Court the other
.Monday. Julia’s last term of imprisonment
expired on the Saturday morning, and soon
after sunset a constable ran her in for
vagrancy. “The police seemed to be wait-
ing for me at the gate,” said Julia to the
Bench, whereupon the prosecuting inspector
admitted that it might be as well to give
the old girl another chance to remain at
large. Obviously she is entitled to as much
(CQuasideration as a stray dog. There’s a
Home for Stray Dogs in Melbourne, and a
feature of the establishment is a lethal
chamber where decrepit inmates are put to
;sleep for evermore. But the only home
jprovided for vagrant humans is a comfort-
less prison, with no lethal chamber on the
premises and no visiting staff of kind ladies
who would pat Julia’s head when she wagged
her doleful tale. Prison is no home for
Julia. It is equally inhospitable and non-
permanent. She can neither live there for

The words of “Henry Horsecollar” :
So the blessed Corporation of Sydney—may its
:name be Mud—pnoposes to take the city garbage 20
miles out to sea and drop it there, in order that
it may not return to defile the beaches where Billo
takes his tart to swim in neck-to-knee costume. It
1S , i (Jea h* h s humble yet bumptious way,
and the alderman who devised it should have a
whole rubbish tip as his great reward, and the
mud punt should he called after him, and his
cognomen, which is probably Cornelius Hogsflesh
, ° ul “ b ? wnt large thereon, in letters of gold and
iett-off chop-bones. Australia is very flat and conse-
quently short of fain, and the seas round it are
father shallow in places. So man, especially aider-
man, whose name is often Smith, or else Briggs,
believes in building 4CO-ton punts, in order to take
■as much of Australia as possible out to sea, and
drop it there, that the ’ land may become flatter and
more rainless, and the isea shallower and less navi-
gable. Also, because the fish supply is scarce, he
drops evii things in the sea to poison the flounder
and dnve the flathead mad. Garbage is mostly a
fertiliser, and, if it were taken inland instead of to
;sea it might enrich the land instead of polluting the
waters. Also, it is more or less of a combustible.
.In some places that are unlike the city of Sydney
it is made to produce light and power and pay a
dividend—-the rather tattered suburb of Balmain
which is just across the water from Sydney, can do
things like that. But Sydney sticks hard and fast
to its costly policy of stripping the land and filling
up the adjacent waters. It is alleged in one of the
more obscure sections of the Scripture that at the
End of All Things the sea will be gathered up and
will cease to perform its old job. Whatever arch-
angel has the business of gathering up the bit of sea
adjacent to Sydney is likely to get a very low
opinion of the inhabitants. He will find a lot of
things there that aren’t sea, unless Sydney repairs
its habits between now and the event.
“Ten Guineas”: Sydney Coroner Haw-
kins, at an inquest on a woman unduly
dead, voiced the perennial grievance about
expert evidence. The woman was in a lift
in one of the' big department stores when
the thing stuck between two floors. After
a long wait for the concern to start, a step-
ladder was brought to help to get
the passengers out. While she was
getting out, the weapon started as
suddenly as it had stopped, and the
woman was killed. The store people,
anxious to allay public concern, produced a
pyramid of expert evidence to show that the
lift was in splendid order and that an acci-
dent was impossible. It was an heroic thing
to do with the dead body staring the experts
in the face, but evidence is a strange animal
and cannot change its spots. Hawkins
tersely remarked that “the expert evidence
is against the facts.” It usually is. I was
interested once in a Vice-Admiralty case, a
steamship having obviously and flamboy-
antly foundered in smooth water. A cloud
of experts—ship captains, marine and dock-
yard superintendents, marine surveyors and
civil engineers, naval johnnies and naval
architects —all swore that the ship was ab-
solutely incapable of foundering. I remem-
ber my astonishment when the Court, after
these witnesses had all finished, had the cool
cheek to bring in a verdict that the ship had
sunk. Still the experts earned their fees,
for the verdict meant that the vessel had
committed suicide, and my crowd didn’t get
a bean.
Perhaps, after aH, Bill Adams did win the
battle of Waterloo. Just across Alma-road
on the south side of the Fremantle Hospital,
is one of the oldest of Westralian cemeteries,
rail of the dust of ancient identities. Bush
fires have swept away all consumable struc-
tures ; but on a stone that lies prone and
broken, there is this inscription:—
Sacred
to the Memory of
WILLIAM ADAMS
(One of the Heroes of Waterloo),
Who died Deer. 12th, 1867
Aged 75 years.
AT THE PALAIS DE DANSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Listen! The sound of solemn feet;
The thud of Percy who collides
With someone’s slow-revolving “sweet”;
The dull, excruciating beat
Of timid footsteps that repeat
Grim, sluggish circlings, small and neat,
To dashing music which, besides
Fast floors, the management provides
For moving meat that glumly glides
It’s not the thing for one to prance
A\ ith joy at the Palaice dee Dance.
Who, throwing off his sadness, makes
A dash and chicken-scratches some,
Or does a hug, or even “cakes,”
Unwritten laws of dolor breaks;
Laughter no merry echo wakes,
As some wild dancer, whirling, shakes
The floor, and tries to make things hum.
He, too, will soon be grim and glum,
Ungay, and good, and circling dumb —
A dancer who no longer longs
To prance at the Palay dub Dongs.

“Übique”: Jaggers was cursed with a goat, a goat
that ‘possessed the combined powers of Jack Johnson’s
punch and a steam hammer. When Jaggers found
his . goat in the act of butting in the sides of his
humpy it annoyed him considerably. He put a
copple of sheets.tof iron up, but the goat playfully
butted them into chaos. Jaggers was struck with a
rush 'of brains to the head. •Ho placed one of “Smith’s

HOW TO NEUTRALISE DANGEROUS
STOMACH ACIDS.
Few people besides physicians realise the
importance of keeping the food contents of
the stomach free from acid fermentation.
Healthy normal digestion cannot take place
while the delicate lining of the stomach is
being inflamed and distended by acid and
wind —the results of fermenting food in the
stomach. To secure perfect digestion, fer-
mentation must be stopped or prevented,
and the acid neutralised. For this purpose
physicians usually recommend getting a
little bisurated magnesia from the chemist
and taking half a teaspoonful in a little hot
or cold water immediately after eating.
They recommend bisurated magnesia be-
cause it is pleasant to take, has no disagree-
able after-effects, and instantly stops fer-
mentation, neutralises the acid and makes
the sour, acid food bland, sweet and easily
di^stcdi
The regular use of bisurated magnesia—
-be sure you get the bisurated, as other kinds
of magnesia are of little value —-is an abso-
lute guarantee of healthy, normal digestion,
for it overcomes and prevents that acid con-
dition which alone is the cause of trouble.*

Some months ago the word went around
Melbourne legal circles that George Moir
was as dead, for business purposes, as his
late partner, Sam Gillott. Also, his no'n-
legal friends and acquaintances—hundreds
of them —shook their heads and gave him
up for lost. George Moir, however, had an
unsuspected reserve fund of vitality to draw
upon, and he is now in a fair way to follow
many another old client to the cemetery.
The melancholy duty of a popular solicitor
is to be in frequent attendance at funerals,
which is about the only sort of attendance
he doesn’t charge for on the bill.
ROBERT
BEST,
M.H.R.
The Roman Catholic
community at Parra-
matta (N.S.W.) has
been celebrating the
75th anniversary of
the appearance of the
first sisters of charity
in Australia. They
arrived in Sydney
in the ship Francis
Spaight, Captain Say-
ers, on December 31,
IS3S. In the list of
passengers published
in the Sydney Gazette
, are found : Dr. Ulla-
thorne, Revs. P. B.
Geoghagan (after-
wards the first priest
sent to Melbourne),
Richard Marum and Thomas Butler; Mrs.
Cahill (superioress), Mrs. O’Brian, Mrs.
Callen, Mrs. de Lacy and Miss Williams,
Sisters of Charity. These sisters were
brought out specially to minister to the
members of the R.C. faith among the con-
vict women. The “female factory,” as it
was called, was at Parramatta; so a cot-
tage handy to the “factory” was secured
for the use of the sisters, and there they
were established for many years.
After a lapse of over a quarter of a cen-
tury, Dr. Strong, of the Australian Church
(Melb.), has had the pulpit of the Collins-
street Independent Church thrown open to
him by Leyton Richards, who succeeded
Bevan. Before he was ostracised, Strong,
who was then pastor of Scots Church, often
preached in the building opposite; but the
doors were closed against him for nearly 30
years. When Dr. Moorhouse was Bishop of
Melbourne the churchwardens of St. Paul’s
waited on Strong and invited him to ex-
change pulpits with Bromby, the incumbent
of St. Paul’s Pro-Cathedral; and Strong,
having obtained the consent of the Bishop,
preached there to a crowded congregation.
He was not allowed inside the altar-rail,
however, and before service a protest was
read by a clergyman. Moorhouse was after-
wards hauled over the coals for allowing a
“layman” to conduct the service, Strong’s
“orders” not being recognised by a different
denomination, and the Bishop was officially
instructed not to commit such a crime .again.

“H. Singemoine” on the attempted
canonisation of Tyson :
I am all with those horse-sense Bulletin readers
who heap the brick of disparagement on Randolph
Bedford’s effort to represent Jimmy Tyson as a
sort of backblocks Socrates, and a model, in general,
for the youth of the Commonwealth. I once spent a
week on a P. and O. ship with that incorrigible
old posturer (I mean, of course, Tyson, not
Randolph), and the imperishable impression which
he produced on most of the passengers, two days after
leaving W.A. (where he got on board), was that no
beauty actor possessed more childish self-consciousness
and vanity. Bedford appears to be afflicted with the
common delusion that vanity is a matter, entirely,
of taking pride in a handsome appearance, beautiful
clothes, fine eyes and such-like essentially feminine
attributes. To this superficial variety of psycholo-
gist, a palpably self-satisfied young A.D.C. in aggres-
sively Clifford-street clothes is abhorrent, whereas
the spectacle of a Tyson garbed, with equal care
and forethought, in a shirt that has not been
washed for months and a suit that is ripe for the
ash-barrel, and spitting recklessly to right and left,
represents the ultimate howl in the way of rugged
Australian virility. As a matter of fact, the one
is as much a poseur as the other, with the differ-
ence that the London youth’s manners and smell
are usually unobjectionable.
Everyone who knew Tyson realised, after a couple
of hours’ talk with him, that he took an inordinate
pride in his dirtiness, in his uncivilised clothes, in
his low-comedy boots, and his reputation as a stark,
dauntless, near-to-nature bushman. His mentality,
like that of so many other men with the capacity to
garner in and hang on to large sums of money, was
of an absurdly inferior order. He was illiterate as
the modern Australian schoolboy of 15 understands
the term. In the intervals of his business deals, life
was to him one long Jack Harkaway adventure. He
loved to be pointed at in the streets, on pub veran-
dahs and the like, as “bluff old Jimmy Tyson, the
multi-millionaire; the simple, unaffected bush bloke,
with no d—d nonsense about him.” A Bathurst
hotelkeeper swore to me that he once saw Tyson
retire to the back-yard of a shanty where he had put
in the night, and bestrew his hat and coat with
dust, a servant who was unused to his ways having
brushed the garments with an eye to profit. This
stunt corresponds exactly, if it is viewed aright, to
the nut’s anxiety to have his silk hat properly
ironed on Cup day, and to the nut’s best girl’s
determination to have a good go at the powder-puff
in the retiring-room at Government House during a
ball. Dust and disreputable-looking clothes were
an essential part of the Tyson make-up. If he had
been forcibly washed ; put into a plain, clean, blue-
serge suit; compelled to wear the unobtrusive boots
that normal men wear; and in other respects made
to resemble one of the Herd, he would have been
as miserable as an earl in bowyangs.
He never read a decent* book; he never gave utter-
ance to a thought of the least value on any social
or political or economic or literary question; and if
he ever did a generous deed, or thought a generous
thought, the world has yet to hear of it on oath—
no mere assurance will suffice. No one will ever
know what went on in Tyson’s mind during those
long, romantic night-rides through the bush that
Randolph mentions. However, if one may estimate
such things by their fruits, his thoughts chiefly centred
on (1) the amount of money he was going to make
out of the particular transaction he had in hand;
(2) his chances of cutting *down the salary of some
poor devil of an employee by a weekly shilling or
so, while continuing to retain the said employee in
his service; (3) the impression he would create at
Scott’s or the Australia or Daniell’s when he next
arrived there in costume—which is to say, unbathed
and .grimy, and theatrically under-dressed. A man
who, like Tyson, deliberately under-dresses for effect
is just as fatuously foppish, at heart, as he who
over-dresses in the same spirit. The dandyism of a
newly-arrived remittance-man only differs from that
of a Tyson inasmuch as the former’s is mostly of a
more sanitary nature. Tyson was a great money-
getter; a great sweater; the “closest” man I ever
knew; and what one may term a Brummel of the
gutter, or, alternatively, a D’Orsay of the old clo’
shop. No; his certainly wasn’t a character to put
into the Lives of our National Saints.
An ancient R.C. cleric passed out at
Hobart on Friday in bis 89th year. This
was Monsignor Hoyne, a Kilkenny man,
who, after his collegiate course in Ireland,
went to Calcutta to the R.C. College as pro-
fessor of mathematics. In 1851 he came to
Melbourne, and was assistant-priest at St.
Francis’s, Lonsdale-street, the first R.C.
church built in Melbourne. Two years later
he went to Heidelberg, then to Geelong,
then to Warrnambool, to Hamilton, and to
Ballarat. In 1899 he visited Tasmania and
remained there. He was chaplain to the
order of the Good Shepherd, and did duty
till three months ago. The oldest R.C. cleric
in N. S. Wales is Father P. Birch, who is
the last of that church to draw a State
stipend. He was enrolled for it in 1859.
“Chudah”: John Freeman-Mit-
ford, fourth son of Baron Redes-
dale, has captured the richest
heiress in Germany—Miss Fuld,
who will have five millions sterling
some day. Fuld is that rare bird,
a Chi-istian Yid. You do find
them now and then. Last year
Moderator Alexander, head of the
Victorian Presbyterian Assembly,
gave the right hand of fellowship
to one Ettmann, a converted Jew,
who labors to bring others in.
Rabbis Abrahams, Lenzer and
Danglow joined in a letter of pro-
test to Alexander. He, in re-
sponse. gave an overwhelming list
of well-known Jews who had been
converted, such families as the
Mendelssohns, Disraelis, etc. The
Rabbis then declared that none of
these were real conversions. They
pointed out that the Society for
the Conversion of the Jews ex-
pended about £BOO per convert,
and even then the outcome was
dubious. Moses Mendelssohn was
the greatest modern Jew to aban-
don the Hebrew faith. The con-
verted branch took the name of
Mendelssohn-Bartholdy. Most of
the converts are made among the
poorest class of Sheenies. They
take the money of the edified prose-
lytisers; use it: _to start pawnbrokeries,
money-lending joints, bookmaking busi-
nesses, etc., and, having connected with
affluence, hurry straight back to the Syna-
gogue. A Jew and a Catholic are two types
that can rarely be convinced of the error of
their ways.
An incident of interest occurred at a
river outing given on the jubilee of the
arrival of five Methody ministers who
arrived at Sydney on January 14, 1864.
(All five are still on top. but four only at-
tended the outing, the fifth, the Rev. Dr.
Manning, having joined the Church of Eng-
land soon after arrival.) The steamer, be-
fore heading for Correy’s Gardens, turned
into Lane Cove River, in order to give a
cheer to J. R. Houlding (“Boomerang”),
old-time author of “Christopher Cockle’s
Capers,” who resides on the waterside at
Woolwich. On the lawn in front of a pic-
turesque cottage stood the ancient tattler,
now 92 years of age, and he waved his re-
sponse to the greetings.
Biographical note re a strenuous Sydney
character: —
W. Scott Fell, who was entertained by some sup-
porters last week, contested a N. Sydney seat as an
Independent at the recent N. S. Wales elections, and
got bumped out. Previously to that he had fought
the Coal Vend, and encountered disaster ; likewise
a number of caitiffs who were avid to bankrupt
him: not to mention an army of other enemies.
W. Scott Fell is a resurgent sort of person. He
has now got the Broken Hill coal contract. The
Vend is still furiously hostile to him, and ic would
far sooner supply him with a dose of arsenic than
with the ships which he requires to carry out his
undertaking, so; he is chartering the necessary vessels
in England. With the help of these craft he and his
friends anticipate confidently that he will presently
garner in a cargo of bullion. Scott Fell also got the
Broken Hill contract some years ago. The Vend
was horrified at the news. It saw in his move an
attempt to destroy Private Enterprise by interfering
with its monopoly. In the end, and after much
embittered parleying, it bought him out —it is said
for the tidy sum of £lO,OOO. Also, he got the
contract on another occasion. But this time the
Vend refrained from buying him out, and he lost
money over the deal. Yet another time the Vend
thought that he was tendering, and to defeat him that
organisation tendered low. The monopolists got the
contract, and dropped good red gold over it, only to
find later that the exasperating Fell had not com-
peted at all. His bankruptcy experiences were char-
acteristic. Justice Street, of N. S. Wales, put it
across him right savagely. After Street had finished
his comments on Fell’s methods, the man in the
tram might have been excused for concluding that
the bankrupt was commercially outed for life. How-
ever, Fell went on to the Hisrh Court, and in that
august jurisdiction he was whitewashed purer than
the driven snow. Had the Hiarh Court failed him, he
would have appealed to the Privy Council, or Inter-
national Law. or to the arbitrament of War or Revolu-
tion. or to Heaven. He is that sort of man. Mean-
while his old foe, the Vend, appears to be wilting.
The famous judgment of Isaacs, of the High Court,
hit it hard, and, furthermore, some of the members
are understood to be distrustful of various other
members. By the present look of things, Scott Fell
will be an affluent pillar of society when the Vend
is, figuratively speaking, spreading its S. M. Herald
out preparatory to a nocturnal camp in the Domain.
Acting-Premier “ BISHOP ” BARNES,
of Brisbane.
Edmund Barton, of the High Court, was
65 years old on Sunday.
Colonel Yernon, who was N. S. Wales
Government Architect (or “Colonial” Archi-
tect, as the queer old title went) from 1890,
died on January 17 after a long struggle.
As a final expedient the doctors amputated
the old man’s leg, 10 days before his death;
but even that heroic treatment was un-
availing—as, indeed, the victim expressed a
hope that it might be, if the thing had to be
done. The late official retired from the
service some three years ago, when Griffith
reconstructed the Works Department from
top to bottom, demolishing the job of
Colonial Architect in the process. After
that he practised his profession in Sydney.
His title of Colonel was derived from his
connection with the old Sydney Lancers,
which he helped to raise. It was a high-
toned institution, though very unhandy with
its weapons, and it looked very well when
its horse didn’t shake it up too much.
B. J. Fink, a paper millionaire of the
Melbourne boom days, was gifted with a
saturnine humor. Here is the story of one
effort amongst the many which led up to the
deceased financier paying a half-penny in the
£on nearly £2,000,000. He called on a lean,
lank banker one morning, and asked him
whether he would take £50,000 of Mrs. Fink’s
money on fixed deposit at 5 per cent. This
was a shade over current rates, and the
banker demurred. “Besides,” he said, “I
might not be able to lend the money quickly
and safely, and the bank would be losing the
interest till I got a good security for it.”
But in the end Fink triumphed, and got out
with )<is wife’s fixed deposit receipt. Next
day, L.J. turned un smiling, and said to
the bank manager: “I thay, I’ve got a very
vood theecuritv for £50,000 at 51 per cent.
It’th a very nitlie thity propputy, and they
vant the money on mortgage for thix yearth
at five and a harf. Can you do it?” Finally,
the deed was done, and the bank was one of
13 institutions that received a ha’penny in
the £. The fixed deposit was subsequently
repaid in full.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A remarkable change in the attitude of the
churches towards surf-bathing is being illustrated by
those now attending the Church Missionary Associa-
tion’s summer school at Austinmer. There are about
300 present, including eminent church dignitaries.
Surf-bathing is one of the chief attractions indulged
in twice daily, venerable clerics being seen shooting
the breakers with their daughters and prominent
lady workers.— Sydney Sun.
The canons shoot in ev’ry wave,
And lady workers splash;
It seems quite reckless to behave
In this way when we’ve souls to save—
Quite reckless, yes, and rash!
But there is. something in the air
That makes me think it’s right.
(Oh, see that lady worker there !. . . .
Tut, tut! I really mustn’t stare 1
That impulse I must fight!)
I never dreamed there were such curves
In my own Bible class!
It sends a tremor through my nerves,
As ev’ry shapely student swerves,
When to and fro they pass.
I try each night to keep my mind
Upon the work in hand,
But figures on the page black-lined
Keep romping till with dreams I’m blind
And wand’ring on the sand.
I cannot think that it is wrong
To gaze at milk-white knees,
And note that Someone’s hair is long!
She has a hand-clasp firm and strong,
When currents bump and tease.
It’s quite intoxicating—quite
To see her sunburnt nose
And red lips from the foam appear!
She is my own—my gospel dear!
To-night I shall propose!

What is expected some day may be judged by the
fact that, though this bank pays no dividend, shares
are now quoted at well above par. And no dividend
can be paid for some time to come. The chairman
12 months ago mentioned seven years, though he
added that it might be a little less. But he
wouldn’t bind himself dr anybody else to anything.
The beast in the path is a certain amount of money
which the bank has to repay to old depositors before
the shareholders can get a bite. When the Govern-
ment of 25 to 30 years ago listened to the tempter
who said (just as was said to Denham lately) that
the State couldn’t borrow too much, there was, of
course, a beautiful boom, in which this and other
banks joined. Then the absurd people wanted their
money back ; and as a lot of their money was lent
on property at inflated values, and as the desire to
purchase properties at inflated or any other values
had fallen dead, the money wasn’t available to do
the repaying with. Hence the people who had lent
this bank their money were offered three-fourths in
inscribed 3§ p.c. stock ; the other one-fourth they
simply had to trust the bank to repay out of future
profits, and meantime it carried no interest at all.
The money which had been lent by the Government
to prop the institution up was, after variqus changes,
left in at £2 12s. 6d. p.c., the full principal being
repayable by instalments up to 1921, It didn’t look
such a very liberal settlement, from the, bank’s point
of view, at the time; but many things (including
the money market) have changed since Queensland
found itself sitting in the gutter outside the pub,
nursing a dreadful head and feeling quite sure that
the earth would never look green any more. Even
the sugar business, which was never to smile again
after Tommy Tanna left, has never laughed so joy-
ously as it has done during the past few years. Con-
sequently, it is quite possible that some of the old
assets, representing borrowed money on which the
bank itself is paying either nothing at all or only
£2 12s. fid. p c., have been earning very good
money for the bank. In other cases, no doubt, those
assets have been sold at good prices, and the money
put into active and profitable business.
At any rate, the bank has been so flush of
money that it has been pre-paying the debt to the
Government; but this, of course, is not out of pro-
fits. The whole position with regard to the ancient
debts of all kinds is shown in the next table: —•
Dec., June, Dec.,

ment .. .. £1,833,327 £218,293 £198,293

positors payable out

It will be noticed that 9d. in the £ of the old
debt to private depositors, repayable out of profits,
called at the last distribution for £38,162. That
would mean an original debt of £1,017,650, or
about £21.000 less than the figures given in 1897.
From this it looks as if some of the old trouble has
been bought right up, no doubt at a stiff discount;
and such a transaction also suggests a hidden stock-
ing somewhere on the premises.
As for current business, take these figures:—

Watch the growth of the new deposits—pretty good
proof of what the men with money think of the
solidity of the concern nowadays. And this paper
certainly isn’t going to suggest to them that their
confidence is at all misplaced. A bank which is liable
to be called on for £6,915,625 to satisfy debts of
all sorts, and has £4,330,373 in hand to start doing it
with, isn’t likely to give depositors any anxiety.
If Queensland had the business to offer, and of a
quality of which the once-bitten-twice-shy manage-
ment could approve, the bank has resources sufficient
to justify it in taking another £1,000,000 worth of
advances at least.
The paid capital is £413,418. A 10 p.c. div. on
that amount would call for £20,671 per half-year.
On the figures in the first table the Q.N. should be
able to do that before breakfast. Very likely some
day, following the precedent lately set by the Bank
of New Zealand, the capital will be increased. The
business certainly calls for more. It is with such
things in their eye that people are offering beyond par
for shares in a co. which, on present appearances,
won’t give a dividend for six or seven years. What
can a man afford to pay for a share which will give
10 p.c. after seven years? In seven years 100 £3
shares then starting to give 10 p.c. will be worth,
say, £5OO, on a 6 p.c. return basis, and £2OO is
fine interest on £3OO for seven years, or on even
£325 —655. per share. (Much depends, of course, on
the state of the money market at the end of seven
years ; but except in very rare circumstances one cannot
expect to buy so as to get more than 6 p.c. on first-
class stock.) Put another way, if a man buys at
605., holds for seven years, and wants to show 7.
p.c. compound for that time, he would not be able
to sell for less than £4 16s. If for the shares for
which he will get £5OO after seven years, he pays
£355 now—that is, 7ls.—he will make 5 p.c. p.a.
compound. Whether, however, he will sell the Q.N.
£3 shares for £5 when they start to pay 10 p.c! is
a matter on which The Bulletin declines to offer
an opinion. It has run out of prophecies for the
moment.

Of course, there was no obligation on the part of the
management to do it; but as soon as ever the direc-
tors had seen that they could pay an extra 1 p.c.
and had decided on that course, an official intima-
tion might reasonably have been given to share-
holders through the press. As it is, some-
body who evidently had a very good idea that
something was going to happen, started to buy up
the scrip of shareholders who didn’t know anything,
with the result that during the week before the
accounts were issued shares put on 15s. It may be
all right, no doubt, but it doesn’t look well—it
looks too much like the leaking-out of information
and the making use of inside knowledge for Stock
Exchange purposes. The bank always has been
secretive. For years and years nobody outside has
known just what sort of progress it was making out
of the mess it got into at the time of the big boom.
At that time it didn’t straighten things up at the
expense of capital, as most of the others did; it
relied upon future profits to fill up the big hole
(size unknown) caused by the shrinkage in the
value of its securities. All along it has professed
to have some reserves—that is to say, something in
excess of its capital. Yet even now, in spite of the
raising of the dividend to 6 p.c., the market declines
to value the shares at par, but writes the capital
down from £400,000 to about £300,000. If, as
some people say, the assets have been restored
and are worth 20s. in the £, a statement to that
effect from the responsible people ought to do the
bank a lot of good. A bank paying 6 p.c. ought
not to see its stock from 20 p.c. to 25 p.c. below
par. It may be very stupid of either depositors or
people who own, or want to own, overdrafts to take
any notice of the price of a bank’s shares ; but they
do. “There is something wrong here,” they say.
But how much there is wrong they don’t know ; and,
as usual, they are afraid of the unknown. If the
directors of the City Bank of Sydney can say that,
on a careful review of securities, they ( are con-
vinced that there is now no over-valuation, or no
over-valuation not covered by internal or contin-
gency funds, shares will probably recover to some-
where near par; and this paper believes that that
circumstance would do the business good.
The movements in the past year and the present
position are shown next: —-
Dec., 1912. Dec., 1913.
Deposits .. £1,902,886 £1,981,432 Inc. £78,546

Premises . . 192,729 194,617 Inc. 1,888
So the bank owes to depositors and others £1,989,197.
Assuming that the capital and reserves are intact
(and The Bulletin is not disposed to think that
there is now very much the matter with them), this
means that shareholders have £1 in the business
for every £4 12s. of the public’s. If there was any
assurance that the capital and reserves are intact,
the bank could safely take much more public money
than that. As at December 31 the bank had in-
creased its holding of liquid assets to £647,239.
Its liabilities being £1,989,197, it thus held nearly
33 p.c. of them in liquid shapes at December 31.
This is not a heavy holding of coin, etc. Still, the
proportion of liquid assets which a bank ought to
hold depends largely upon the current account deposits
in proportion to the total of deposits. The larger
the proportion of money that is liable to be called
for any day, the larger, of course, should the pro-
portion of liquid assets be. As the proportion of this
bank’s current account money is probably not very
large, the position with regard to liquid assets
may be better than it looks.
While the long job of straightening things up has
been in hand, the bank hasn’t been a very progressive
concern. A sort of settled gloom seemed to
over the premises. The declared profits are now,
however, equal to about 74 p.c. on the capital; and
if this and the raising of the dividend to 6 p.c. can
be taken to mean that all but perhaps the tail and
hoofs of the old dead horse have been shifted, a
little more vigor might be infused. Perhaps the
bank knows its own business best; still in these days
of fine exchange profits it does, for instance, seem
like throwing money away not to have a branch m
London.
The Commonwealth Brass and Metal
Foundries. Ltd. (Sydney).—Early last year the
first accounts of this “product of the recent company -
floating boom” were discussed like this: —•
“The co. has a capital of £ 26,950, of which
£23,021 is paid; and no less than £12,716 was
sucked up for certain patent rights. Add to that
paper asset £1348 for preliminary exes. ; total
froth, £14,064, plus probably something spent on
altering the co.’s business premises. To the end of
November last a loss of £998 was shown on the
working of the patents, which were alleged to be
worth £12,716. The shareholders didn’t like the
look of things, so they asked the directors to see
them again in three months’ time. As the accounts
for that period show a further loss of £434 on
trading, without any allowance for depreciation,
shareholders are invited to meet at the end of this
month to vote a bonus to the vendors or something.
The co. has already accumulated an overdraft of
£llO9, and owes £1434 on other accounts, and the
creditors are probably not as affable as could be
wished.”
Nobody is very affable now. Some time during
the year W. E. Downing, a director of John Allerdice
& Co. Pty., Ltd., a Victorian foundry firm, became
managing director, and in return for a certain allot-
ment of shares was to give his services for 12
months and put the resources of the Allerdice estab-
lishment at the disposal of the co. Apparently there
was trouble right away, and now, in a circular
accompanying the co.’s second balance-sheet, the
managing director issues statements which ought to
make some of his fellow-directors sit up and take
notice. One director (specified) is alleged to have
taken strong exception to the co. sending its traveller
into “the suburb which he seemingly considers his
close preserve,” this director being in “the whole-
sale plumbing trade”; another director, it was
reported, “was endeavoring to purchase shares at a
low price,” and strongly resented the issue of an
official circular recommending shareholders not to
part with their shares until they had certain forth-
coming information put before them; and an
opinion of counsel (J. A. Browne) is fur-
nished to the effect that there is “very
strong evidence that the vendors knew their
Australian patent was bad,” and that “the contract
between the vendors and the co. is voidable at the
option of the co., which may elect to ratify it on
any terms as to return of shares or otherwise as the
directors think best.” From this it appears that the
patent rights, which represent £12,720 of the cap-
ital of £29,607, are no rights at all, and are
apparently worth nil. The position according to the
published balance-sheet is as follows: —
Capital .. .. .. .. £29,607
Less Patent rights .. .. . .£12,720
Prelim, exes. . . .. . . 1,092
W. E. Downing’s services . . 3,100
Alterations to premises . . 298
P. & L. balance (less forfeited
capital) .. . . ■ . . 3,660
Liabilities .. . . . . 1,417
22,287
Tangible assets to represent a
capital of £29,607 . . . . £7,320
Apparently 598 shares of £5O each have been issued,
of which 240 seem to have gone to the vendors.
If counsel’s opinion is sound, and if the vendors
sold to the co. patent rights which did not exist,
and if, as he advises, the contract may be voided and
the vendors’ shares cancelled —that, at any rate,
seems to be the effect of his advising—there would
be 358 shares, and the assets would show about £2O
each for the £5O put in. But it appears that some
more shares are due to Downing, which would re-
duce the value of the tangible assets per share. And
whether the tangible assets are worth 20s. in the £
is exceedingly doubtful. Plant and machinery arc
down for £6030; and,' according to a report made
by one of Allerdice’s men, part at least of the outfit
is of little value. Add to all this that the directors
are quarrelling violently among themselves, and the
best The Bulletin can do for shareholders is to
oiler them its sympathy. It might also throw in
the advice never to buy a “patent right” until the
patent has been granted ; but probably it isn’t neces-
sary so far' as they are concerned. Yet there are
people who, evidently, are prepared to do it. Only
the other day a prospectus was issued in which the
public was invited to put up a large sum of money
to buy a “patent” which was ohly an application for
a patent.

As a matter of fact, all the shares are ordinaries
now. Jhere used to be £17,000 of 6 p.c. pref.
capital, represented by what were called “A” shares ;
but these were exchanged for “B’s,” or ordinaries, on
payment of the bonus mentioned a few lines from the
bottom of the table. Taking all things into account,
the co. has done remarkably well during the year.
The Metropole is a travellers’ house, and travelling to
Sydney had its disadvantages during those months
when the visitor had to be vaccinated before he could
get out of the State. Also, no doubt, the higher cost
of living has affected the price of hotel as well as
private provender and attendance. That the co.
should have made a profit greater than that of any
year prior to 1912 therefore shows careful manage-
ment. And you see the same prudence in the com-
paratively large amount put to reserves, notwith-
standing that, owing to the increase of ordinary
capital, the 10 p.c. div. has called for more money
than hitherto. Still, even now, the capital account
( £120,000) is not high. For many years it was
extraordinarily low, the result of the bargain price
at which the present co. took over the property and
other assets from the Melbourne co. which formerly
owned them. The property still stands in the books
at the £lOO,OOO which it cost the co. plus £4OOO
spent on additions; but furniture, extensions, etc.,
seem to be mostly paid for out of current revenue,
although £14,500 of the reserves stand to the
credit of various funds to provide for special replace-
ments or to pay for upkeep in lean years when the
trotter will be scarce. Meantime the co. maintains
a nice, solid amount of liquid assets to provide for
such contingencies ; liabilities of all kinds amount to
only £2921, while assets, apart from the freehold,
machinery and furniture, total £29,860 —mostly hard
cash. With the recent building of two or three
other fair-sized residential hotels the Metropole may
suffer more competition that it has been bothered
with in the past; but until Australia has one of its
slumps this aspect of the case doesn’t look as
though it would seriously bother the co. The fact
is that, despite the fairiy quick growth of popula-
tion, hotel licenses are gradually growing less,
and there isn’t enough sure profit in the residential
business nowadays to tempt people to launch out
into a large expenditure on premises that have the
sword of Local Option hanging over them.

This co. has had an unusual run of profits. In older
days, when it was a meat packing and freezing
concern and nothing else, the extreme variations in
the seasons of Queensland made all the difference
between profit and loss. When stock was scarce,
after a drought or other trouble with the cattle,
prices for live stock ruled so high that there was
no profit in the export trade. But then a few
things happened, to the great advantage of this co.
First, the American Meat Trust either squeezed or
frightened so many American meat-growers out of
the business that the U.S., instead of being big
exporters, can’t produce enough for their own stom-
achs. The operations of the Trust have in this and
other ways pushed up the average price of meat in
England; and an uninterrupted run of good seasons
and a comparative absence of redwater and other
troubles has enabled the co. to get the supplies
to sell at the good prices. Moreover, in the poor
times of 10 vears ago, the co. plunged in Northern
station properties to the extent of about £150,000.
Robert Philp, who is an incurable optimist, was, no
doubt, largely responsible for this move; and things
worked out this time very much as the optimist had
foreseen. True, the directors say this year that
the profits from the stations have “not been as satis-
factory as was anticipated”; but, then, we don’t
know how satisfactory it was anticipated they would
be. All that is certain is this: just as for some
time a few years ago there wasn’t any business in
Australia which showed such profits as lamb-raising,
so now there isn’t any with larger profits than
cattle-raising, and the outlook for at least a few
years ahead is particularly rosy. Anywav, the co.
has made slashing profits out of something. The
paid capital is £191,062, and the visible net profits
in the past four years have been £143,338, and you
can’t want much better than that, especially as the
co. is risking no capital but its own; its entire
liabilities amount to only £88,750, while its cash,
stores, book-debts and unsold products total £128,890.
And besides the visible profits, the co. has very
likely made a nice bit which has been written off or
set aside against contingencies. Factories, pastoral
properties, live stock and shares in other cos. are
lumped in the balance-sheet at £322,460 “after
providing for depreciation,” and in a case of this
kind the proviso is- elastic enough to stretch from
Dan to Bally Bally. If, however, the directors
haven’t seized their opportunity to do some hard
writing-down (which can be accomplished partly by
taking in the natural stock increase at a nominal
figure), they know less about how to make them-
selves snug than they ought to with their experi-
ence.

A remarkably solid concern is this pioneer among
“provincial” trustee cos. of Australia. Of its capital
of £20,000 and its reserves of £17,146, no less
than £33,695 is in cash and public securities, after
allowing for the dividend; the trifling balance is
represented by mortgages ( £1500), freehold pre-
mises (which cost £2612, and have been written
down to £1800) and etceteras. If the investments
bring in only 4 p.c. all round, they produce enough
to pay 7 p.c. on the capital, including the £5OOO
which a while ago was transferred from reserves.
And there is a very fair business, too, on which to
earn commissions; trust estates in hand are valued
at £1,789,808, as against £1,369,749 five years ago.
The man who wants to see a quick 25 p.c. rise in the
market value of his scrip can’t be recommended to
bother about inquiring into this or any other
trustee co. But there are very few concerns which
offer more solid security for a man’s pfincipal and
have better chances of steadily improving their busi-
ness and their profits.

The P. and L. balance brought forward from the
previous year was £34,356 ; total to be dealt with,
£76,273. This amount has been appropriated as
follows: —•
Spent on concentrating plant.. .. •• £48,414
Written off (repurchased debentures) .. 27,859
Total ..£76,273
Nominally the co. writes off £57,500, debentures
that face value having been bought for £51,068.
This £57,500 is made up of £50,000 written off
underwriting commission and £7500 off trifles, in-
cluding £2500 spent on establishing a butchery
and bakery—two of general-manager Bellinger’s ideas
for keeping the cost of living within bounds at
Cobar, and thus protecting himself against demands
for further pay. Nothing has been written off plant
directly; but the £48,414 spent on the new con-
centrating plant, and not charged to capital account,
is an indirect writing-off. Once more, of course, the
shareholders get nothing. They have had nothing
since shortly after the co. was formed, in 1907,
and they ought not to have got anything then.
Now, why? The Great Cobar had been worked
for some years by a syndicate, consisting of the
Longworths, A. J. Gould, Dr. Read, and two or
three others, and it had made rich men of them all.
Moreover, it is quite well known that the mine was
still making good profits when it was sold to some
speculators who passed it on to a London-Paris co.
The capitalisation was absurd, partly because the
promoters’ cut and other exes, were so monstrous,
but that doesn’t explain the failure to pay any
dividend at all. A mine shouldn’t make any the
less profit because the co.’s capital is £1,000,000
when it ought to be only £500,000. The only differ-
ence ought to be that the dividend per cent, is
reduced by half. Certainly we have to remember the
debentures; the co., which began with £550,000,
had increased them at the end of 1909 to £757,000,
but has since reduced them to £667,300 by repur-
chases. The truth is that, in order to justify the
monstrous cut which the promoters were getting out
of the flotation, the most extravagant estimates were
made regarding the mine; and somehow or other
those estimates were supported by technical men who,
to say the least of it, should have known better.
Incidentally, since it was notorious that the mine
hadn’t been making anything like the estimated pro-
fits, it became necessary to discredit the then-existing
plant and the management. With new men and new
machines they were going to produce copper at a
profit if the metal fell to £45 per ton. Kendall
said so even at the end of the first year.
When the expected results didn’t turn up, Blake-
more, who had been general manager for the syndi-
cate, and remained on with the blQated co., was
sacked. That was what it meant, anyway. It
wasn’t the new plant's fault, of course —the time
hadn’t yet arrived for cursing the new plant. Ken-
dall struggled on awhile ; and then he —who had been
responsible for the plant—-was got rid of, too. That,
however, seemed only a fair thing. Then came Bel-
linger, from America, with a fine reputation as a
smelter. Now Bellinger is going. This paper has
always had a lot of sympathy for Bellinger. The big
mistake he made was in not telling the cold, hard
truth as soon after he arrived as possible. A more
crafty man would have taken the gloomiest view of
the position. “The case, is a very serious one,
gentlemen, but I think I may be able to pull you
through, as long as you don’t expect too much.
Almost any doctor or any lawyer would have told
him the thing to say when meeting a client or a
patient (they mean the same thing) in difficulties.
But Bellinger is a big, comfortable man who hates
to make anybody else uncomfortable. So he said, in
effect: “Oh, things are not so bad. Buck up —
we’ll soon be all right!” Perhaps he mightn’t have
been quite as cheerful if he had realised his diffi-
culties. But how could he,-a man just dropped into
Australia, with nothing much but misleading reports
to go on so far as the mine, etc., were concerned?
Even when he had suffered many disappointments,
and made the shareholders suffer with him, he didn’t
turn off the tap of his excessive optimism. Thus he
promised that the new concentrating mill would run
700 tons a day, whereas “the latest advices are that
Mr. Laird expects shortly to be able to treat 500
tons dailv.” When Pellew Harvey, a mining
man on the Board, was sent out last year to look
round, the conclusions he came to were, briefly,
these: —
(1) “Tlie general manager has failed to appreciate
the importance of selecting the best men possible
to supplement his efforts.”

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardmge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Ilardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of. If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

(2) “The general manager should have more fully
appreciated the difficulties, and made them clearer
to the directors and shareholders.”
(3) “Administrative qualities of exceptional char-
acter, apart from those of a technical nature, are
needed in one responsible for the control of such an
important enterprise. In my opinion, without wish-
ing to reflect, I feel that reorganisation of the entire
staff and a change in the general management of the
co. is necessary, a particular qualification being an
intimate knowledge of Australian labor and condi-
tions in that country as a whole.”
The Bulletin has been putting it that way for a
couple of years past. And at last the Board agrees
and appoints 8., M. and Co. as managers, and
“under this arrangement, G. C. Klug, 8., M. and
Co.’s general manager, will take control at an early
date.” Few men know Australian conditions better.
The reconstruction of the co. is no doubt desirable.
Under the trust deed the co. must redeem £lOO,OOO
of debentures every year at 105 before paying a
dividend. This is far too onerous an undertaking.
The mine is capable of a long life, but not of a
dazzlingly profitable one. The redemption of the
debentures might, therefore, reasonably be spread
over a longer period. Also the capital not repre-
sented by tangible assets ought to be written off,
so that the big appropriations towards the cost of old
mistakes may be done with, once and for all. This
may help everybody to realise that the thing is a
plain bread-and-butter proposition, without too much
butter; and when nobody has anything to gain by
pretending that it is anything else, a heap of money
may be saved, and a heap more disappointment pre-
vented.

The long jump the profits have taken from the
figures for the previous half-year is due to (1) an
increase of about £3OO in the rents, etc., and (2)
the heavy outlay on repairs during the early part of
last year. For a long while nothing was written
off for depreciation of the, building wherein the
wool and coal and shipping people most do con-
gregate, the idea being apparently that the unearned
increment was racing ahead. Also, accountants have
struck a new excuse for not writing down pre-
mises. The cost of building has been mounting,
they say, at the rate of about 10 p.c. p.a. for the
past five years, so that a building which was worth
£20,000 in 1908 would cost £30,000 now; hence,
if the building stays in the balance-sheet at £20,000,
it has really been written down £lO,OOO in five
years. It is ingenious; but the trouble is that
some day the premises will have to be renewed, and
(if prices don’t fall again) they will have to be
renewed at the higher price. Hence the increase
in the cost of building doesn’t do away with the
necessity for a rebuilding fund. This view of the
matter evidently appeals to this co. ; wherefore,
though its principal tenant had lately to make large
additions to secure a renewal of a lease, the co. is
now writing down its premises. And there is plenty
of surplus profit to do it with, since only 44 p.c. of
the half-year’s earnings are divided among share-
holders. If things go on like this one wouldn't be
surprised if the gilt-edged old concern got back to
the 7 p.c. which was paid for many years prior to
1902.
“Vital Spark”: What has become of the
Meteor Igniter Co.? It was to supersede electric
sparking in explosion engines, and up to now I
cannot find that it has even been successfully demon-
strated. I took shares 18 months or so ago, under-
standing that the thing was a proved success, and
I’d like to know which is responsible for the long
delay—the thing itself or the management.
General-manager Bellinger, of Grea,t
Cobar, writes that the meeting of shareholders in
London in December had nothing to do with his
resignation, which was forwarded to the directors
last September. Though 8., M. and C. have formally
taken control, Bellinger will remain in charge till
February. The introduction of 8., M. and Co., and
the large powers conferred on them, have caused a
stir in the camp. G. E. Baker, a director, who
was sent out from London to look after the business
side of the undertaking, has resigned.
From Cobar: Occidental’s manager Norris
is reported to be. leaving shortly. This co. is up
against a tough proposition in its lower ore bodies,
notwithstanding the increased contents, regularly re-
ported to the press. Also, it is said that Great
Cobar’s recent importation, G. A. Laird, of Mexico,
has left, and will probably not return The Chesney
nlant, which cost over £50,000. has been hung up.
If, as stated, it is a success, why is this so? Surely
it wasn’t put there to look at!
On top of the announcement of the pro-
nosed hvdro-electric scheme for the Grafton Copper
Mine. (N.S.W.) comes news of further labor troubles
resulting in the closing down of the. property. For
the past 12 months the once-flourishing co. has had
troublous times, due mainly to shortage of payable
ore, a state of affairs largely brought about by
neglect of development work, especially when all was
prosperity. The outlook is none too bright, more
especially if the water-power scheme be persisted in.
A large supply of optimism is necessary to proceed
with such a proposal in view of the depleted ore
reserves, the somewhat uncertain and not too large
water supply for power purposes, and the cost of
plant and transmission of power over seven or eight
miles of rough country from Falls to mine.
* * * *
The Bourke’s Hill Sluicing Co. (Emma-
ville, N.S.W.)' reports, as usual, that both plants are
sluicing with average prospects. The recent rains,
have assured the water supply for some time ahead.
The time is, however, approaching when the question
of removing the plant to a fresh site will have to be
considered. Although a fairly substantial reserve
has been established to cover the cost of removal, it
is possible that dividends may be affected for the
time being. The unkind behavior of the tin market
and the possibility of a decrease in tin values of the
ground also point to the likelihood of diminished
profits. * * *
“Ballarat” : What are these incompetents
of the lodide (N.S.W.) talking about? Imagine a
pumping difficulty in the dry Western country! At
Daylesford (Vic.) there is water worth talking
about, yet by ' carrying a tank under the cage the
Ajax is hauling a million gallons a day; and by
bottling up the shaft above, it is down 200 ft. below
the working levels. And here is the lodide sinking
7ft or so in half as many months! lodide wants
development, but it seems to want management more
than anything else. # ,
Westralia produced 31,3860 z. more gold
in 1913 than in 1912, and thus broke the fall in
output that started nine years ago. Kalgoorlie, as
usual, furnished more than half of the yield, but
the percentage is slowly but surely being reduced.
Some mines there still have “millions’ lh sight,
but all are wasting and several have galloping con-
sumption. The fabulously rich Oroya shoot has
passed away ; the Lake View Consols, Associated,
Boulder Perseverance and South Kalgurli have been
depleted of their best; Boulder has one foot in the
grave; Ivanhoe is off color in depth, and as a big
producer Kalgurli’s day is past. The best Kalgoorlie
developments of the year were the intersection of some
high-grade values at a depth of 2000 ft. in the Lake
View lease, the opening-up of the south-western ex-
tension of the Horseshoe No. 1 lode at 1.600 ft. in
Chaffers, and the discovery of one or two good makes
of ore at depth in the Horseshoe. There is nothing
startling about any of these finds, but they may
lead to better things. To the end of 1913 the field
had produced £62,630,877 worth of bullion, of
which 10 mines (Horseshoe, Boulder, Ivanhoe, Per-
severance, Oroya-Brown Hill, Lake View, Kalgurli,
Associated, South Kalgurli, and Associated Northern)
were responsible for £51,729,647. Yilgarn did_ the
best among the other fields, while Murchison,
which occupied next place on the production list,
also showed up fairly well compared with the figures
for 1912. Meekatharra was again the main source
of the Murchison output. The principal additions
to the State’s producers in 1913 were Bullfinch Prop.,
Corinthian North and Edna May, all at Yilgarn.
These tluree shows are together crushing about 10.000'
tons & month for a return of, roughly, £20,000.
BullflapJdJ- may rediuce its yield at any time, but both
the Edna May and Corinthian intend to increase'
their outputs before long. Dividends for the year
totalled £909,387, made up mostly as follows: Great;
Boulder, £262,500; Ivanhoe, £170,000; Kalgurli.
£96.000; Golden Horseshoe, £60,000; Sons of
Gwalia, £64.000; Yuanmi, £43,750; Associated’
Northern, £35,000; Boulder Perseverance, £34,986;
Bullfinch Prop., £23,807; Sand Queen, £21,000 ;
Lake View and Star, £32,000 ; Mararoa, £15.000;
Associated, £12,384 ; Great Fingall, £12,500 7
Black Range, £7250; Edna May, £4125 ; Golden.
Ridge, £2318; Burbank’s Main Lode, £1767. Pro-
duction of other minerals was well in advance of the
previous year’s figures. Copper and silver-lead showed 1
substantial increases; tin just about held its own..
Collie’s coal industry went ahead, and if not ham-
pered by increased railway freights and local
harassing conditions, is likely to continue to do so.
Producer gas played a prominent part in the reduc-
tion of working costs on Westralian mines during the-
year, and many shows in the back country which
could not be previously worked on account of the
prohibitive cost of fuel are now being turned to pro-
fit. Sons of Gwalia has gone in for this class of'
power on a big scale, and but for the enormous
scrapning that would have to be done, several of the-
big Kalgoorlie mines would follow suit.
# * * *
Associated Northern (W.A.) is up against
trouble at the Victorious leases.. Ora Banda. . Pro-
fits have become attenuated owing to depletion of'
the rich shoot and exhaustion of oxidised reserves,,
and developments in the sulphide zone are on the-
lean side. A patch of good stuff has just been.
struck in the east end of the No. 6 level; but, as with
several others that have been exposed, its extent
is not likely to be very great. The co. seems to be
still in doubt whether the resources of the property
justify the erection of a sulphide plant, and from
all The Bulletin can hear the doubt is well-
founded.
Central and West Boulder (W.A.) has
issued a report stating that £14,196 was obtained';
by tributing on its Kalgoorlie leases during the 15
months ended September last, and that its cut out
of the proceeds amounted to £1505. The ore treated’
gave an average return of 7dwt., but boreholes put
below the 400 ft. level indicated the existence of
stuff worth about 12dwt., and steps are being taken
to prove the extent of these values. The. co. has a',
large interest in the Damo tin property in Nigeria.,
which has lately been puffed by its controllers, and’
declared to contain a considerable area of tin-bearing-
ground.
Kalgurli (W.A.) now has £60,000 in cash’
and investments and a bullion reserve of about:
c 13.000. . Neither general-manager Black nor Dr..
Maclaren, who made an inspection for the Board,,
hold out any hope of payable values being met with’,
in deeper sinking ; but in order to make doubly sure-
that there is nothing below, Black recommends that
money be spent in diamond-drilling. This will pro-
bably be done. Meantime some of the old levels and!
the ground between them are being prospected in-
all directions and payable sections opened up. Tt
seems likely that the mine will continue to be profit-
able for a year or two yet, but exactly how long- iff
is impossible to say.
* * * *
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) is conti nmrlTy
being credited with good developments, but somehow'
the market doesn’t respond as much as expected'.
The latest reports claim that a length of 9ffoft. of
payable ore has been exposed in the bottom level
(No. 19), and that hopes are entertained of the-
shoot extending for another 300 ft. or more. Winzing
below this depth .is also stated to be opening up
good values, and with the earlv prospect of satisfac-
tory developments at the No. 20 level, where driving'
is about to be started, the mine’s admirers think
that quotations should be higher than they are.
Apparently some person or persons operating on
’Change hold an opposite opinion, and are backing'
it. t 9 #
Fraser’s old mine at Southern Cross'.
GW A ) has lately been prospected to 1000 ft. by bore-
holes. -In all, '3569ft. of drilling was done, and’
results showed the reefs to persist at depth and to-
carrv good values in places. W. J. Loring recentlv
tried in London to get capital to work this show,,
but found there was nothing doing. Apparently-
London gamblers are afraid that if a start was once-
ma(le —and it would have to be on a big scale- to-
rpake it worth while—-they rnigh,t have to meet
demands for increased wages and higher water rates,.,
besides having to chance the possibility of the earlv
introduction of reforms, such as abolition of com-
tract, stoppage of night shift, limitation of heights
of stopes and other things which the State Labor
Ministry proposes to add to the laws of the country
as soon as it can bring the Upper House round to its
way of thinking.
Unable to find anything suitable in the
West, manager Hamilton, of the Boulder, has gone
to Stawell (Vic.) to have a look at the old Mag-
dala. At one time this was the deepest mine in Vic-
toria. Latterly very little has been done in its work-
ings.

Ballarat proper had the luck to get 900 oz.
more gold during the last quarter of the year than in
the previous three months, but the return of 52390 z.
irom 22,567 tons is less than the old field used once to
turn out weekly. Even out of an average of under
sdwt. stone, a few divs. were naid by the two Llan-
berris mines. Yet how sick things are is proved by
the fact that only 823 miners are left to punch out
quartz in the central division.
The people who have stuck to Long
Tunnel, Walhaila, are sure that the turn has come.
Not only is 2ft. of stone showing in the winze below
3225 ft., but it is butt up against a nice-looking
dyke. This is the best bit of right stuff got since the
new crowd dispensed with the stinking-fish party.
When “Geology” Herman started the hunt after
Cohen’s reef in the deep ground, his idea was to get
below the belt of crushed country where the reef
had shot away from the dyke and lost its richness.
If additional work proves the old contact of the
diorite with a sprinkling of antimonial pyrites and
with the quartz hugging it closely, stranger things
than a humming time might happen at Walhaila. It
would be like Dickenson’s luck to hit the double in
two has-beens like the Tunnel and the A.I. at
Gaffney’s. # #
The Langi Logan boom has been so well
worked that lew holders know that the boom has
.already happened, though they must know that the
cunning crowd is out. Here’s for a comparison.
Cathcart Central is in 50,000 £1 shares, once 605.,
now 355. The gutter was found to be 200 ft. wide,
and “proved ” worth over 3oz. a fathom by truck
■samples. But when blocked out it came down to
2oz. a fathom, and costs are loz. a fathom. The
■co. started paying 2s. divs., and then came down to
Is. every five weeks, and passed the Christmas div.
altogether. And the Cathcart Central is the richest
thing since Madame Berry. Now the Langi Logans
gutter is 1000 ft. wide, yet they expect it to beat the
Cathcart for value. The co. is in 100,000 shares,
now 365, or £lBO,OOO for a mine not yet operating,
the evidence of value being confined to the results
of bores. The action in bores drilled into wash
with much water above it is a concentrating action,
and the gold content of the bore is not reliable evi-
dence of the bulk. The rise is going up in the
richest ground yet touched on the mine, so results
there may give another lift to the increase in share
values which followed on the bore-sampling. But if
Langi Logans are worth 365., Cathcarts are worth
755. ; and you can get them for 355., which is pro-
bably their value. # *
Charters Towers crushed 6120 tons of
stone in December for a return of £25,159, of which
£13,956 was from the mills, £5613 from the cyanid-
ing of 5493 tons of tailings, and £5590 from the
smelting of concentrates. The average was £4 Is. 7d.
per ton. For the year 78,910 tons were crushed, and
the total return from all sources was £306,898. In
dividends £49,903 was paid—-a surplus of only
£l2 024 over calls collected. The Brilliant Extended
paid’ £18,750. or nearly 40 p.c. of the total. lt lias
iust opened No. 22 level, but the reef at 3000 ft. is
less reliable than it was at 2000 ft. Apart from these
deep levels the field’s most hopeful prospect at the
moment is in the shallow and long-abandoned Moon-
stone mines. The deepest workings here are only
164 ft vertical, but owing to the extremely flat dip
.already four levels have been opened. Last year two
mines,' the Papuan and New Queen Cross, crushed
between them 3839 tons for £26,887 ; but the proved
reserves worth £7 are very small. The Papuan will
crush again shortly. ,
* *
Hampden-Cloncurry (Q.) reports striking
the Trekelano lode at the 200 ft. level of that outside
property. The lode is described as being 12ft. wide,
worth 7 p.c., though the first sampling over 48in.
gave only 6 p.c. At the 80ft. the lode has been
driven on for some hundreds of feet. The co. is
smelting over 60,000 tons of 9 to 10 p.c. ° re
annum, and a lot of development will be required to
keep pace with that drain. Reserves are estimated
at 255,000 tons averaging over 9 p.c.. lhis isn t
much of a quantity to support 350,000 shares and a
smelting capacity of from 60,000 to 70,000 tons a
year. , * *
North Queensland’s coal fields are reach-
ing an interesting stage. Blair Athol, 250. miles
west from Rockhampton, produced 4o 438 tons in
six months to September 30, for a profit of £5094
It has declared a sixpenny div. < £2500), and some
of the optimists are sure the mine will give £lO,OOO
a vear in dividends. Other mines on the same field
are coming to the front. The Newcastle Colliery
put out 1725 tons for a month; and a co-operative
party has started work on one of the Bluff leases, and
is said to have a contract to supply 60,000 tons to
the railways. Further north, Mount Mulligan pro-
mises fairly well; the lower tunnel is showing a
seam 24ft.'thick of good quality. Numerous leases
: have been taken up at the Bowen coalfield. Geologist
Dunstan points out that the shaft section of the
1 Denison seam is apparently coked, and he advises
deeper sinking. The field is about 50 miles from
Bowen. *.
London mining speculators are looking at
-the Palmer (N.Q.). A 50-acre lease embracing the
Queen line of reef was recently applied for on
behalf of E. W. Caldwell, who had an early-day
experience of the old field. The Queen turned out
£125,000 worth of gold from very shallow workings.
' It is said, also, that 8.. M. and Co. are investigat-
ing The Louisa line, for the working of which a
co has just been formed and registered, and which
eets a £7500 subsidy from the Government, has
aDnointed a manager, and as soon as the wet season
trover operations will be started. Things look
better for the Palmer now than at any time since
it went to sleep. # *
The Laloki mine, which Great Fitzroy
• has decided to hitch on to, to see if it will help to
find the elusive dividend, has an area of 116 acres,
and is at the foot of the Astrolabe Range (Papua).
The original finders scratched a little, saw that there
was something in it, and sold out to the British
"New Guinea Development Co. This co. also scratched
a little and saw that the mine was worth while ; but
a proposition of the sort was out of the co.’s line.
Hence Great Fitzroy was offered a 15-months option.
That co inspected and tested ; and, partly in hope and
partly in desperation, took the thing over. Fitzroy s
testing showed the ore body to be of dense sulphide,
with little silica, and a suitable flux for Fitzroy s
own ores, besides which it should provide a tonnage
for local smelting.
Sungei Raia tin looks about as badly a
busted piece of Malay mining as any Melbourne crowd
has ever spent money on. A. S. Carroll, manager,
in a special report to shareholders, carves up things
generally, basing his criticism on a personal examina-
tion of the mine and of the accounts. His opening'
‘ bump was to find debts; his next, to alight on a
judgment got by angry creditors. By the time this
tangle had been unravelled he found that borings
•on the mine only gave up to o.Blb. of stream tin to
the cubic yard. This wouldn’t pay. So Carroll
plumps for letting the ground on tribute to Chinese.
By screwing a royalty out of them and selling the
plant, he ought to clean up the slate without further
calls on shareholders. To get them a bit of
their own back he proposes to pick up a Selangor
block of 49 acres and bore it, and, if the sampling
is 0.K., to equip it as an open-cast mine for £2500.
Carroll, by this time, ought to have learnt the
East,” and so will no doubt be trusted with the
cash to have a final fling.
* * * *
There is a more hopeful feeling among
mining men regarding the future of the Waihi
(M L.) field. The deep-level developments in the big
Waihi and Junction mines have caused the people
who control the Waihi Reefs and Gigantic properties
—about 800 acres—to get busy, and the shaft is to
be deepened from 800 ft. to 1250 ft., and a crosscut
thrown out to intersect the bullion-producing Waihi
reef system. The Waihi field outside the two big mines
has never been prospected much, because deposits of
recent origin have covered up the older rocks, and
the pumice, etc., has to be pierced several hundred
feet before the reef country is reached.

From a correspondent: After a long and
weary search, oil has been struck in the Phoenix bore
at Motorua (M.L.) at a comparatively shallow
depth. Almost simultaneously the Consolidated
Oilfields of Taranaki Co. got news that oil had been
struck in its Huiroa bore at a mere 1200 ft. lhe
locality of the latter strike is 10 miles south-east
from Inglewood, in the Huiroa survey district, lhe
Consolidated shares are mostly held in Canterbury

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 19, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
Manly was tied up in bunting and Chinese
lanterns for several days, with a final car-
nival bang on Saturday night. Colored
lights gleamed round the fringe of the
watery basin on the harbor side in the
evening, and every species of craft sidled or
fussed across the bay. In the afternoon,
Manly visitors stamped off the crowded
ferry boats in that mouth-open state which
marks the deep-breather on the track of
ozone. Near the wharf the air was thick
with prawns, which turned their pale pink
corpses and starting eyes in a limp heap of
briny smell on the passers-by. The regatta,
which started at 2 p.m., was as thrilling as
most regattas—that is to sav, the sailing
craft meandered round a pleasant sea-breeze
and came back to their moorings without
smashing records. The man who seemed to
be working hardest on the ocean side was a
surfer who rushed at the Pacific Ocean with
an ironing board, got out as far as he could
with his timber, and then rode it into shore.
An English tripper who saw the flurried
tail of the Manly carnival on Saturday even-
mg, remarked that Australians get a lot
of fun without making much of a hole in
their cash. At Sea View (Isle of Wight)
I understand you pay to take a short cut
across a small beach-end that leads to the
big stretch of creamy sand. It’s only a
penny or so, but it’s a beginning. Having
gained the Right Place, you then enter into
negotiations to hire a small tent with a flap
that slaps you in the fact if the weather
is gusty. There is no separate charge for
the flap or the slap: you only pay for the
tent After retiring to this stronghold you
disrobe for a dabble in the sea. If you’re
careless about it, you find the tent too small,
and poke a leg or an arm into the fresh
?J. r - , V®, re i, s n ? cll ai'ge for the fresh air.
Most of the day is passed in a bathing-gown
elaborate enough to satisfy the critical
glances of any stray flotsam and jetsam of
Society which may be paddling at Sea
View. Tea is brought to the tent door in
the afternoon at a high figure, and if the
t. ® 1S in R comes high enough to mingle
with your cake and lap the milk-jug. I
orget whether you pay to walk back across
the sands or not. I think you do. In the
evening Sea View either attires itself in
the latest London fashions, or gets into a
semi-batliing-gown and wades after shrimps.
~ re free. There are other charges
which I disremember, but I believe the thing
costs a lot more than Manly.
, Germans kept up their annual
national fete m their usual address on Janu-

he was gently led outside by an official peri

Agnes Goodsir, an Australian artist who
has been abroad for about eight years, talks
ot giving a one-woman show here within the

steady business as a portrait-painter on the

Some wandering Australians now in
i ans were invited to a Tango Tea there
just before the last mail left. “The en-
trance fee was five francs each, and the tea
itself, which included most of the delicacies
out or season—your genuine French gourmet
doesn t care a sou for food in season—must
have been a costly spread. However, as
we . w m r u e guests, expense was no object to
us . The Tango itself, or what we had time
to see of it through a dazzling parade of
trocks, was no more exciting than the old-
tashioned galop, so I expect we saw a Sun-
day edition. It was merely an excuse for a
mannequin display.”
The International Medical Congress, the
first to meet in M.L., will open in Auckland
on lebruary 9. Dr. Valentine, the Do-
minion s chief Health Officer, is a large
cheerful, breezy individual who might easily
be mistaken for a heavy-weight champion
with a punch. The Massey Government is
going to spoon-feed the Pill and Plaster bri-
gade with sulphur fumes at Rotorua, and
will explain through its tourist guides, the
number of inhalations a minute a
really reliable geyser will make after it has
swallowed a few bars of soap.
John Harper, who is to take Tom John-
son s place as Chief Commissioner of Rail-
ways until other arrangements are made, is
a six-tooter who has grown white whiskers
in the service. Years and years ago there
were Harpers who had a timber-yard at
anamatta, and John, who was the boss’s
son, played with the chips and the sawdust
until he was old enough to put on a junior
porter s uniform. Then he more or less
specialised in traffic, and has been the official
mouthpiece of the Department before the
VVorks Committee since ever there was a
Works Committee to inquire into the
prospects of proposed railway lines. Unlike
Johnson, who is a bachelor and has lived
ins out-ot-office life in the quietest corner of
a club, Harper is a domesticated animal,
who drops out of his official quarters in
Macquane-street into a pair of gardening
trousers and grows cinerarias and other
choice but inedible vegetables. Like a for-
mer Commissioner, Oliver, he gets the rest
of his lecreation as an enthusiastic cricket
barracker.

The Jim Allisons, of Coomoo Coomoo sta-
tion, up Quirindi way, came to town last
week. They’re cooling down at the Clifton
Gardens Hotel, on the brink of what used
to be Chowder Bay—but you mustn’t call
it that any more. Though Coomoo Coomoo
homestead has a name that often gets it
into trouble with casual correspondents, it
is a most attractive sample of an Austra-
lian up-country bungalow, with verandahs
wide enough to billet a squad of cadets. An
unusual duet in the vegetation of those parts,
a huge lemon tree nodding to a giant orange
tree, greet the sundowner at the entrance.
Mr. Jack Bridges, of Kickabill station—
the big sheep-walk on Liverpool Plains that
used to belong to the Higgins family—is
sauntering by Manly’s towelled shore. His
irreproachable hair, always beautifully
parted in the middle, keeps the even tenor
of its place in any breeze that blows. This
is a cause of bitterness to that portion of
the male population in the surf-side village
which is young enough to feel annoyed at
the ruffling of its wind-blown locks. The
gone-to-bits appearance of Society on any
line, afternoon in the breaker-shooting ham-
let is most apparent in its seaweedy coiffure,

Miss Susie O’Donnell, a daughter of the
late P J. O’D. of Mingay station, said she
would love, honor and obey (in a soft whis-
per ) Barrister Flannery on Saturday last.
She is a sister of little Aileen, who married
the long cricketer Warwick Armstrong a
while ago. The groom used to be associate
to JLamuna Barton, and wont off as socre-
tary or gentleman help to Australia’s noblest
s pn (this myth still lives in old newspaper
clippings) to England for some royal crown-
ing or burying, years ago. The Flannery
honeymoon is flitting past in Melbourne.
Dr. Adams, who used to be a naval
man, lias bought Vectis, Double Bay,
and will hang out his sign on the front door
or the garden rail. His wife is the eldest
daughter of E. Knox, of Bellevue Hill. The
Adams pair tripped back from England
about the time the vaccination plague was
brooding over us and our belongings. He
was offered a seat or lounge on the Board of
Health, and promptly closed with the offer.
Now he is getting into business for himself.
A daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Etienne de
Mestre, of Moss Yale, who was married to
one of the Burwood Yates family, may be a
granddaughter of the late Etty de Mestre of
sporting fame. De Mestre bred horses and
lost a pot of money in clean, honest racing
on Bje AnsLmli&n turf. He owned Archer,
the Melbourne Cup winner in 1861 and 1862.
Tim Whiffler, another of his Cup victors, got
away with the prize plate in 1867, and lie
an °B ier winner f° r the big event in
.v when Calamia left the field weeping
in the rear. In spite of many victories the
late sporting de Mestre didn’t leave much
behind him except a record for going
straight. s
Poiret, the Frenchman who is said to
design frocks as Bernard Shaw carves out
the framework of a play—with his tongue
in his . cheek—is threatening the return of
the crinoline. This trousered dressmaker
knows that women -who want to be first in
frenzied fashion will make any kind of
fools of themselves if a Paris clothes-man
leads the way. Therefore he talks of “sim-
plicity of line and breadth of mind,” and
puts his followers into a pair of silk panta-
loons. The crinoline tunic, according to the
gospel of Poiret, is the forerunner of the
early-Victorian bird-cage skirt.
The Victorian Trained Nurses’ Journal
Una remarks that the result of the ballot
(on December 30) re increased fees for
nurses was yet to come in. The proposal
was carried in Sydney, and ought to be
pushed through as a bare act of justice to
highly-specialised workers. As Miss Helen
Gould, of Sydney, an acknowledged autho-
rity on modern nursing, points out, the
working life in private nursing is short
After humping her suit-case for 10 years
from house to house, the average nurse is
an old woman in nerves and bodv. She
sleeps anywhere or nowhere—usually on a
make-shift couch in the patient’s room If
she. be worth her wage, she does all the in-
valid cooking , and the chores in the sick
room, in addition to her own .duties.
A nurse who loves her work is too ex-
hausted after a strenuous case to take
another forthwith. She has to snatch a few
nights regular sleep to brace her up for the
next uncertain series of half-waking naps

of any standing would allow such “help”
with his cases. As a matter of fact the

trained nurse is raised to the altitude which
command the wage almost of an un-

these things, she may achieve the dazzling
prospect held out to her by the Camooweal
Hospital committee.
The Twilight Home for old ladies is in the
way of luck.. It is getting a handsome New
Year s gift in the shape of a nice plot of
F°und near Spit-road. Mosman. The donor
is Mr. H. Gordon, of that suburb of feverish-
looking roofs and many cool waters. The
committee will put on its spectacles and
peer into building plans immediately, if not
sooner.
. Have you ever noticed that when the
nights are warm and sleepless the morning
papers throb with brain-racking letters
e . e lv it0 T-rr on^ u ? h Quarrelsome topics as
v\hat Do We Believe?” This tiny planet
is peopled with millions of atoms who are
ready to bruise, beat or boil for the cook-
pot millions of other atoms who believe
that they don’t believe what the other specks
try to believe. The subject is an irritating
one that ought to be put on ice to cool till
Faster revives the theological warriors.
. Maud Telfer, a youthful Sydney soprano,
is preening her feathers for flight to the
Gold Land. She joins the Quinlan Co. in
August, when it begins rehearsing for its
1915 world tour.
Florence Smithson, the English soprano
who ekes out a living on £lOO or so a week
in her busy season on the other side, is
coming here in July. Just now she is
warbling at Drury Lane, where hubby Dan
Rolyat had a bad accident a while ago. He
is still laid up and feeling very sick about
the back. But the Smithson voice trills
long and loud enough to make bread and
marmalade for both. Incidentally, Dan is
in easy financial circumstances himself.
News drops in from U.S. that the Melba-
Kubelik tour is cleaning up the omnipotent
dollar over there at record speed. In Kan-
sas City, the receipts for one concert were
T U roo£ 00a Yet Kaa .sas City only holds
about 82,000 people, and is very little bigger
than Hoboken or Scheneclady, or even Paw-
tucket. The little fiddler, bv the way, is
evidently at the zenith of his fame, for a
new cigar has just been christened “the
Kubelik.
Leura is full of panting Sydney goffers,
who stamp round the links mopping their
dripping countenances, and hoping to catch
a cool change round the next corner. The
almost übiquitous Gidley Kings, the Kirk-
knds, Grahams, and the slender Mrs. Max-
well Allan (skimming after her ball like a
swallow darting at a gnat) are just now
habitues of the breezy mountain village.
. A writer in the Argonaut (San Fran-
cisco) heaves an unkind aspersion of ink at
Mrs. Spankworst, the English militant lady
who had a brief look in at N’York last year.
He says a N’York reporter had the bad luck
to describe the traveller’s costume as “a sort
ot dressing gown,” whereat Mrs. Spankworst
arched her back and bristled for days. But
the reporter, being a man, knew no better
and intended no insult. After this passage
of arms, the “Votes for Women” apostle
was to have taken part in a grand march
at a ball in Chicago, with a gentleman
named Samuel Gompers—one who has led
many strikes and got into many troubles of
his own. But at the last moment,” snorts
the Argonaut, “Fate, in the shape of Mrs.
Gompers, intervened with an injunction. She
said, If Sam dances with any woman it
must be with his wife.’ ” That settled it.
Samuel Grompers evidently knew that he
was hable to fall in the soup, and fled from
broth to come. He did his performance
with Mrs. Gompers, while Mrs. Spankworst
—deserted, abandoned, lonesome and be-
trayed looked on from the gallery with
window-smash in her eye.
The Herbert Jeffersons have left their gor-
geous garden at Strathfield for a month’s
surfing at Cronulla.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 19, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Fuller dame, garbed in mourning, de-
parted last week by the mailboat. Some of
the. National Council women and represen-
tatives of some of the pet Fuller charities
hurried down to ugly Port Melbourne with
vegetable offerings. The outgoing lady
murmured tactful speeches on the steep
gangway, with one eye anxiously fixed on
the children. The other eye was sufficient
for the breathless visitors. Kirkpatrick, who
attends her, is an excellent courier but a
poor nursemaid. (Stewart Richardson, an
earlier Help, was ideal at the nursery job.)
Anyhow, he had a small levee of his own to
keep him busy. The farewelling lady said
to the upturned faces and hats, “It is not
altogether good-bye; I’ll be keeping in
touch.” Previously her “good-bye” message
to the people of Victoria had been reveren-
tially published by the dailies. Time was
when only the salaried male figurehead was
supposed to offer words of consolation to the
devoted pubilc through the newspapers; but
nowadays his wife takes a half-share in the
melancholy duty, and soon the governess and
chief maid will add a few sympathetic re-
marks, while the butler sadly drinks the
country’s ’ealth.
New State Governor Stanley is bringing
two fresh Helps for drawing-room inspec-
tion. One is Captain Gale, of the Bedford-
shire regiment, and the other is Lieutenant
Wilson, of the Tenth Hussars. The Hussar’s
haberdashery is bound to stun the Best
People, but I’m doubtful about the Bedford-
shire millinery. I’m afraid it’s rather un-
distinguished.
Commander Corneille gave a consul party
on his white ship L’Avenir, last week, when
representatives of all countries and their
ladies sampled the famous Belgian salads at
dinner. The cadets played soft, greasy music
after the feast proper, while the already well-
fed guests munched Belgian cake with their
coffee. The cake was made aboard and was
decorated with a sugar lion and other her-
aldic _ accessories. Belgium is very proud of
its lion, which walks gingerly across the
shield, like a performing animal on a tight-
rope.
From “Rosna,” in London:—
Dr. Alice Burn, a Maorilander who is school-medi-
' cal officer and assistant borough medical officer of
Cheltenham, has been in a fracas with the panjan-
drums of the education committee. The lady had
the effrontery to deliver lectures on vegetarianism in
her free time. The other medical officer, one of the
lordly sex, did not approve of vegetarianism, and it
was naturally considered extremely forward of a
woman—and a Maorilander—to have views. How-
ever, the lady gamely refused to resign, and the
education committee is now considering whether she
shall be executed or recommended for a title.
Australian sculptor Bertram Mackennal was called
in to have a chat with King George at Buckingham
Palace this week. He was also entertained by the
Authors’ Club. Now almost anything may happen.
Britain is slowly solving the problem, “What
shall we do with our widows?” The latest Blue Book
asserts that there are in England 77 plumbers, 70
paperhangers and whitewashers and four bricklayers—
all relicts. There are also 347 car-ladies and wag-
goneresses, 231 she-blacksmiths and strikers, 13
widow-masons and 56 lady-carpenters. Incidentally,
there are 126,435 (or so) widowers whose small
children live on bread-and-jam and go to school untidy
for want of a woman in the house. This world
badly wants re-arranging. Mr. Winston Churchill
will probably be driven to take it in hand some day.
The new owner of the Covent Garden property,
Mallaby-Deeley, will receive the tolls paid to the
Bedfords since the days of William IV.; thus “2d.
per round or head load” of strawberries, Id. a sieve
of onions, Is. 6d. per waggon of carrots, etc. One
old tenant of the market has been telling of some
record prices. For Lord Rosebery’s wedding he was
ordered to get 251 b. of strawberries and 251 b. of
grapes. The latter cost 255. a lb. and the strawberries
3s. 6d. an ounce.
A sigh of regret went around the very
best pastoral-property circles last week
when the death of Harry Ryan was an-
nounced. Harry, the elder brother of Dr.
Charley Ryan, was a stock and station
agent, and the squattocracy held him in
particular regard as a valuer of acres and
flocks and herds. Old Grammarians re-
membered him as a star oarsman or oarsboy
in the long ago. and clubmen called him
“one of the best.” Mr. Ryan was supposed
to be getting along nicely after a Christmas
Eve operation for appendicitis. Then he
had a relapse. People don’t die of opera-
tions. The relapse is what does it.
Allan Burgoyne, M.P., whose name spells
“Australian Burgundy” in London, is re-
turning thither this week, after a trip
around the vine-growing districts. In the
House of Commons the progressive Allan B.
is a recognised discusser of naval matters,
and a while ago he introduced a measure,
which was carried, against the White Slave
Traffic. When Be visits Australia he is
talking wine trade most of the time. He
and his brother hold several properties in
the Rutherglen (Yic.) district, and during
this last visit he has added the old Emu
Vineyard to their possessions. The Emu
Vineyard had been ever so long in the hands
of the Prentice family, whose name is at-
tached to the gold mines and township of
Prentice Freehold. The vineyard is a lovely
property of 500 acres, and the vines are all
flourishing from “resistant” stocks. A wise
grape-breeder follows the vine of most re-
sistance, it seems.
The massed population of Panton Hill, in
solemn conclave assembled, recently bailed
up one of the Gibson girls and handed her
an address of thanks and other embarrassing
things for her many neighborly acts to the
bush people. Mrs. Ernest Keep is the eld-
est of the Gibsons. They are now all
married save the philanthropic Alice, who
lives an ideal bachelor life in the hills. Like
her sisters, she is well supplied with cash ;
but she is, in addition, an artist with an
Edinburgh exhibition to her credit. Frank,
the brother, is well known in the art world
and helps to select the Felton pictures which
periodically disturb local art lovers.
Widower Deweit, who has been “in wool”
here for 30 years or so, has been entertaining
the Belgian master mariner at his Macedon
house —a place with the usual wonder gar-
den that surrounds every old summer man-
sion on the cool Mount. The Norman
Brookes’ place is next door, so early morning
tennis has been raging.
A young Scotchman who recently caused
heartburnings amongst our best-dressed
youths by the exquisite quality of his socks
and ties, happened to be in Maoriland during
the strike and nobly offered to do a little
stoking on a steamer. He got his chance;
but the experience seems to have scorched
all his dress ideas out of him. He hardly
troubles to look at other johnnies’ socks
now. and can remain quite calm in the
presence of a tie like a Chopin nocturne.
The youngest (and frankest) daughter of
a well-known family is wandering off
for a spell of foreign travel with mother
and her numerous sisters. The party is
dividing into two contingents and going by
different boats. The flapper explains
shrilly to all who will listen that “all of us
and the maids, y’ know, make too much of
an army.”
Some time in the future, Dorothy Bird is
going to flutter from the parental Fred Bird
nest to a flapper-crowded wedding. Her
engagement to Eric Brookes, of Queen’s-
road, Melbourne, is just announced.
The Burnham-Niall wedding is going to
be quiet, if not actually furtive or under-
hand. The dreadful news has been received
with yelps_ of annoyance from the unem-
ployed Society girls, who were looking for-
ward to the usual semi-religious pantomime.
From the gadfly point of view, the
quiet wedding (confound it!) will be a
wicked waste of opportunity.
The Grice clan is very excited this week.
Nancy, of the Mqondah branch, which waves
at Mornington, is marrying a Bananalander,
Alexander Howatson by name. Cousinly
Grices have been hurrying back from the
ends of the earth for the event, which is to
happen in the old-fashioned church on the
top of Mount Eliza. The hill is one of the
motorists’ favorite tests, and the Best
People will smoke to the top joyously.
The Clegg maiden is to become Mrs. Simon
Fraser on Tuesday, February 17. The
chief shepherd of Scots’ Ivirk, in Collins-
street, will work the transformation.
Audrey Chirnside, who is off with mother
to Robert Hitchens’s Nile, had a good-bye
party in the stalls at “Diplomacy.” A row
of lovely opera coats and a few men com-
prised the gang, which was led by a purple-
frocked chaperone. Audrey wore bunches of
baby roses on a very transparent chiffon
gown, and Beryl Fitzgerald was generous
with her handsome back. In another party
were the Frank Madden girls. Not to be
outdone by anyone in the matter of revela-
tions, one dimpled girl close by showed much
of a pink silk leg, preparatory to revealing
more on the kerb outside the Royal, at motor-
boarding time. The Chirnside outing fin-
ished with a rose-heaped supper at the
Savoy, with a good deal of champagne
amongst the roses.
Mrs. Donald McKinnon, the big, imposing
dame who dominates charity meetings, and
whose word is law —or jaw-—will be back in
Melbourne for the gyrations. She has been
having her daughter polished, finished and
wound up in the Old World, where you can
buy education with a head on it at cheap
rates.
The widow Landale’s two daughters are
coming out from London again. Daughter
Edyth and husband Cyril, who is also her
cousin, are due in Melbourne this month,
with return tickets in their pockets. (Or
maybe both tickets are in one of his pockets. )
The Ronald Murray pair will arrive in
February with their much-travelled infant,
to resume practice as Australian citizens.
The George Chirnside dame, who is taking
daughter Audrev back to the land where
dukes run about unleashed, hostessed a num-
ber of farewell house parties at Werribee. The
pathetic lack of lurable bachelors practically
reduced the gatherings to hen conventions.
Nephew Pat and a friend (Heaven help
them !) were the only males in the chatter-
ing congregation.
Rose Seaton, formerly a well-known
Shakspearian in Sydney, about two
years ago came south to Melbourne,
and has since been taking a lead
in McMahon’s Repertory shows. Lately
she launched out in recite! work, engaging
a few excellent but struggling artists to
assist her. Unfortunately she made the
new St. Peter’s Hall, Eastern Hill, her
place of entertainment, and as the general
public hadn’t struck St. Peter’s on Eastern
Hill before, it didn’t roll up in huge masses.
However, the recitals were an artistic suc-
cess. Now the lady is to reap some sort
of a reward; she is to take up a position as
high priestess of dramatic art at tlie Con-
servatorium of Music that lately was
Marshall Hall’s, and, in the future is to be
run by Pitzroy Hart, Edward Goll & Co.
Mrs. Freddie Shipman, who is helping
her husband to steer tenor Dufault through
Maoriland, writes shiveringly of the Inver-
cargill summer—and every shiver makes me
envious. “Fighting Freddie” expects to be
back in Melbourne in March, when the Nor-
dica action is programmed to start.
Irene Browne, as the dressy Comtesse in
“Diplomacy,” commits the unforgivable
(dressmaker’s) sin during the frock display;
a rough-edged seaxn in the train is clearly
visible as she trails to and fro. The usual
chiffon veil serves to uncover the leg that is
fashionable.
Mrs. Brough, who provides a clever old
woman study in “Diplomacy,” gives the play
a pleasant, old-time feeling to the older gen-
eration of Melbourne playgoers. Irene
Browne is mostly frocks —lovely Parisian
things made in Melbourne especially for stage
posing. One black dress, with a wisp of
white chiffon and a Paddy green sash for a
foundation, has the absurd new train that is
pushed in front instead of being dragged
behind. Irene tripped over this foolish dead
end at the end of a fine scene, and clawed
her way to the door, kicking all the way.
She wears race dresses and garden-party
gowns for nine o’clock morning calls, so the
Comtesse evidently didn’t own a walking
skirt.
Actor Frank Lincoln’s personable young
widow, who now runs the Fairlie House
flatterie, is at present enthusing over her
five-year-old son. He has been nicknamed
“Bundle,” because he was packed up in Eng-
land and sent out to Australia carriage paid.
Sculptor Cadorin, _ who is also a dress
builder, is off to his beloved Italy again.
Lovie Mueller Cadorin follows dutifully with
a damp handkerchief and tear-misty eyes.
She just hates leaving home and mother.
Incurable shoppers are thinking as they
rush towards the bargains of the sinister
speech of Fire-Chief Lee after our recent
ragtime blaze : “It is not necessary to be a
fireman to realise what would happen, if a
fire broke out at a busy time. The people
inside would never get out, and we would
never get in.” About the only thing left
standing after the sacrifice was a wall bear-
ing the painted yell—“ Great Record Summer
Sale Now On.” It moved many women to
tears.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
A sort of Sabbath calm broods over Adelaide. The
best tea-things are packed away. The croquet mallets
are at rest. The moth-brick and the gladder rags
of yester-year are lying down together. Nobody
is doing anything but work. Socially the place is
comatose, if not dead.
Mrs. John- Bagot has returned from England, only
to find the city more than ever like Pompeii or
Margate—that is, from the viewpoint of a confirmed
fashionable. Her son and his wife are quietly but
very firmly packing with a view to the invasion of
London. They will leave their infant behind. It
is of an age when food appeals to it considerably
more than social gaiety—and, thank Heaven, the
food of Australia is still all right. Dashes to the
Fog are also being hastily organised by the W.
Haywards and the A. E. Wiggs. :
Mrs. John Dunbar, of Melbourne, and her small
daughter have been at the Grand Central. Miss
Kate Gardner has also been leading the strenuous
life of the visiting Victorian after a lazy fortnight
on the Dalton yacht. The Stephen Rallis' are aboard
that well-known craft at the time of writing.
Dr. Constance Ellis, of Melbourne, has been staying
with her sister, Mrs. S. J. Jacobs, at Glenelg.
At the inter-State cricket match I noticed, in
various stages of excitement, ranging from that which
is commonly termed blithering down to the mild
variety that is observable when an Elder of the
Kirk throws a fit during a dull service on a hot
Sabbath afternoon —at this more or less classic
struggle I saw, I repeat, the Edwin Smith nobleman,
the Willie Popes, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Hawker, the
W. A. Magareys, Mrs. C. Irwin, Mr. and Mrs. Barritt,
Mrs. Roy Milne, Dr. and Mrs. A. A. Hamilton, Mrs.
John Corbin, and Miss Jessop. There were others,
but their names will not fit into this issue of Tin:
Bulletin on account of the advts.
And now for a seasonable li-r-I mean, anecdote.
A trades-union secretary was sleeping peace
fully in his camp on the sand, at Glenelg, the
other night, when he felt something crawl up his
Leg and go to sleep on his Heart! ! The place
being Glenelg, and he a trades-union secretary, he
naturally paid little attention to the happening—
no more, in fact, than an ordinary man does when
a scorpion dives down his bare back. In the morn-
ing the —yes, gentle reader, you have guessed aright
—the deadly snake, being thoroughly rested and
warmed, uncoiled its noisome and venomous length
and slid thoughtfully home. And now comes the
incredible part of the story. The trades-union secre-
tary was frightened. His teeth chattered. He trem-
bled. There is always some damning flaw in the
consistency of these reptile tales.
Aviator Jones accidentally swallowed some embro-
cation the other day. He absorbed it in mistake for
medicine, but after he had got a cpuple of flagons
down he came to the conclusion that some of the
1914 vintage of bush whiskv had got into the bottle,
and called a halt. Meanwhile, a total stranger was
passing bogus cheques in his name in another part
of the city. And only the other day he smashed his
aeroplane up. Still, as he philosophically puts it,
things might have been worse. The aero might have
killed him ; the cheques might have been cashed ; the
embrocation might really have been bush whiskv.
Life is full of such compensations. Talking of this
particular Jones, he has not been able to
get his flying machine into work again after its fall—
which wasn’t exactly a fall, but an over-swift descent
caused by failure of petrol. He is still pegging
away at repairs, and meanwhile a few friends in
Adelaide have handed him £25 with a bunch of com-
pliments. Jones, in responding, said that he is
not out so much to make money as to show Aus-
tralia the possibilities of the aeroplane in war.
Miss Dorothy Luscombe, as tall and fair and
lovely as ever, is on a visit to the Harry Duttons, at
Victor Harbor.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.
“Hamer”: Official figures show that 93
per cent, of Australian mothers have
claimed the liver since the maternity bonus
became an established fact. The allowance
has been paid to 130,000 women altogether,
it would be interesting to know the ladies’
opinions of Cook’s proposal to put the brand
ot pauperism on future applicants. But
Oook probably knows their views on the mat-
ter by now. which is the best of reasons
why he is likely to leave Fisher’s measure
alone.
From the Sydney Telegraph of Jan. 8:—
the coming octopus.
, Says the latest American Sheepbreeder (Chicago):
It is a safe bet that in 10 years the Chicago packers
will control the mutton and beef trade of South
America and Australia.”
But the Telegraph knows that this is all
nonsense. There are no Trusts in Aus-
tralia. Also there can’t be any Trusts in
Australia. The alleged “octopus” is really
a philanthropic animal which will give the
growers a few millions more than they get
now and sell the meat to the public for a
few millions less, and that will naturally
result in the animal having a few millions
left over for himself. The idea that the
octopus, having got control, will squeeze the
grower into selling for less and the public
into buying for more is. so utterly absurd
that the Telegraph wouldn’t even allow
Australia to protect itself against the possi-
bility.

“/Esculapius”: In ancient Greece they used to
erect temples over natural springs and give to each
a titular diety. We moderns are no less appreciative
of the healthful virtues of a mineral water-only our
methods differ somewhat. For instance, up at the
famous Helidon Spring, the water is secured just as
it bubbles up from the earth, and hermetically sealed
until the process of aeration and bottling is com-
plete. You don’t need a Greek fineness of palate to
appreciate the cool charm of Helidon Spa—it has
the same delicious refreshingness to Billjim as to the
Earl of Hopetoun. As a blender with wines and
spirits, too, it gives just that added snap and
sparkle that counts so much in the sum of pleasant-
ness. You’ll be wise to always make it a practice to
* Figaro . Read a par. here the other week about
'Nature planting the giant stinging nettle in N.Q.,
but close beside it the tree whose leaves serve as an
antidote to its sting. This provision of Nature is
in no way unique, for, just as she curses us with
indigestion so she blesses us with Helidon Spa.
After dining out you’ll have no next morning head-
ache if you take a bottle of "Helidon” before turning
in—this delicious mineral water is Nature’s gift to
those who have dined not wisely but too well. A single
glass will dissolve the undigested food and at the
same time ensure a perfect night’s rest. Quite apart
from its health aspect, "Helidon” greatly enhances
the flavor of wines and spirits—so truly the way of
wisdom is always to
SPLIT IT WITH
HELIDON.
ABORINGI-
ALITIES
“Vakuta” : I’ll have ten bob’s worth that
the Papuan is the most superstition-ridden native in
the Pacific. I’ve had some of my boys working for
me for years, yet nothing I can do to shame them
out of their helplessness before witchcraft has any
effect. They look upon death in all cases as being the
result of hoodoo (pourri-pourri) ; there is no natural
death. If they hear the cry of a bird in the night
they know that witchery is abroad, and every waking
soul in the village lies as still as death itself lest
the evil spirit be attracted to them. The taboo is
another powerful factor in their lives. No native
would touch anything—house, garden, canoe or even
cocoanut palms—that bore the sign which says in
effect, “Beware of the Dog,” or “Keep off the
Grass.” To ask a boy to climb such a palm for
fruit would be equivalent to requesting him to
commit suicide. On the death of the native the
relatives smear themselves all over with grease and
charcoal, and, in some cases, retain the decoration
for months. Also, there are only certain kinds of
food they can eat. One man I knew, mourning for
his wife, was obliged to drink salt water so many
times a week. Towards the end of the performance
he looked like a skeleton on a hunger strike.
“E.S.S.”: Through the S.A. wheat areas
farmers watch the passing train with anxiety; not
only because it belches sparks, but because careless
travellers have a habit of unburdening themselves
of their superfluous glassware as they pass along.
Numbers of passengers carry bottles of milk or
ginger-beer or water on long journeys, and as these
are emptied they are pitched through the windows.
Many a bush fire has been started by a bottle, or
a piece of broken glass, lying among dry quick-
kindling stuff with a hot sun shining on it. For
this reason the wheat-growers gather up the ruins
and throw them into creeks, or stand them on
stumps. When a bottle-disgorging train passes
every day or so, this is no joke. In these parts the
wax-match is taboo, and anybody seen carrying a
firestick would be chased as a lunatic or arrested
by the nearest trooper for imperilling life and pro-
perty. Nearly everybody uses safety matches, and
no one is allowed to smoke an uncovered pipe in
the august presence of a wheatfield. When the
grass is long and the wheat is maturing the settlers
form themselves into fire-brigades, new handles are
wedged into tomahawks, the wood axe is ground in
readiness for chopping bushes, and a supply of bags,
tied on the ends of sticks, is kept on hand. In-
structions are given to station-masters to transmit
telegraphic and telephonic messages free of cost, so
that when Jones drops a match, or a spark from
his pipe, he can ring up Smith, Brown and Robin-
son to come and put their conjoint foot on it, and
prevent a national disaster. If I can induce the
bottle-hurling fiend to cut this paragraph out and
paste it on his dead marine I’ll have a great recep-
tion next time I carry the National Debt through
the wheatfields of South Oss.

“Leo Lear”; I notice that recently one
Abo.-scribe exercised his pen in declaring that breed-
ing cows for milk production would increase tuber-
culosis. Wrong. You can’t breed cows for milk
unless you feed cows for milk also. In feeding
cows for milk you must give them those foods which
produce milk. In doing so, you down the cause
that nearly all diseases are traceable to, i.e., insuffi-
cient quantities of nutritive foodstuffs. Fill up the
animals with coarse, bulky grass, and milk as many
as you can cram on to a holding, and I guarantee
tuberculosis, colic, rickets, etc., will increase like
germs in a sewer-pipe. But cull out the weak, and
feed on rational lines, and you do away with the
very essence of disease. Tuberculosis could be
rubbed out of dairy herds that supply cities with
milk in a very few years, if all milkmen of this
branch were compelled to house and handfeed. In-
fection in this disease chiefly comes from dried
saliva left on the grs-ss by a sick cow. So if the
milkers were fed in stalls, continually under the eye
of intelligent men, tuberculosis could be held in
check, if not clean wiped out. Why blame the cow
for her diseases? It is the rotten, unscientific way
she is fed, or rather unfed. As for exterminating
an industry, as some scribes suggest, because it is
bad in spots, better exterminate creation at once,
and have done with it.
ON HER DIGNITY.
MISTRESS : "But you should use your own
common sense."
NEW DOMESTIV : “ Beggin’ your pardon, muni,
but my sense ain't no commoner than what
yours is."
“Tarago” : Every Abo.-ite with a claim to
the title has observed the howling gale which
follows in the wake of any bush-fire of importance,
even though the atmosphere off the track of the
blaze may be as stationary as a Liberal Govern-
ment’s policy. Now, I don’t want the whole tribe
to rush in with the information that it is caused
by the hot air rising and a cold current hurrying to
fill the vacuum. I know that. The thing I don’t
know is: What sets the course of the wind in the
first place. At the beginning of things the fire must
suck the cold draught from all sides equally; but
subsequently a steady breeze sets in definitely from
one quarter or another, and develops with the pro-
gress of the flames. I have then seen big gums bend-
ing to a gale on the track of a fire, while one could
cut chunks out of the heavy, motionless atmosphere
where I stood, not a quarter of a mile distant. Also
what is the cause of the frequent willy-willy that
whips up the debris over the burnt track when the
ashes are cold and grey?
THE FRISKY ELDER.
Train up a child when he is old, and when he feels young again he will not
depart therefrom.
“A.L.8.”: Evidently the discourse con-
cerning the color of crows’ eyes is endless. In vari-
ous outback Queensland papers I have seen its trail
during the past couple of years. Each writer has
definitely settled the subject; and every time it
has been settled it has been resurrected. “Machete”
(B. 30/10/13) says that the white-eyed bird is the
young of the brown-eyed bird. How does “Machete”
account for the facts: (1) in some districts there
are no brown-eyed crows; and (2) in some places
there are none white-eyed? “The Birds of Aus-
tralia,” by Lucas and Le Souef, says that Gould
thought the raven and the crow were the same
bird, and that he (Gould) was of “Machete’s”
opinion concerning the eye, or words to that effect.
Gould was wrong on the first item, and on the
second Lucas and Le Souef say: “We need not make
two species of crow because of the color of the
eyes, but the raven is certainly distinct from the
crow, and has never been found with a white eye.”
There are three kinds of these birds. The same
authoritative book opines that they are (1) Crow
or hazel-eyed crow ( Corvus coronoides ), Australia
especially north and west, plumage uniform purple-
black, all the body feathers snow-white at the base;
(2) small-billed crow ( Corvus bennetti), S.A., V.
and N.S.W., similar to C. coronoides, but smaller in
all measurements; (3) raven or white-eyed crow
(Corvus australis), Australia and Tasmania, plumage
uniform purple-black. Similar remarks are made
in Leach’s “Australian Bird Book.” But “Machete”
was partly right. I have concluded that the young
of all three have white eyes; that the black-eyed
chap (C. coronoides) is the only one of the three
that will learn to talk ; that he has a kindly nature,
which prompts him to avoid attacking sheep’s eyes,
etc., and that the bird chap mentioned ( Corvus
australis) is the brother of Mephistopheles. The
second bloque ( Corvus bennetti) is a kind of well-
developed cross-breed from these two, with many
of the characteristics of both, being kindly of
savage-natured, according to the condition of his
liver. All are carrion birds, though they also have
a great fondness for fruit.

“S. S. Severn” : Laria was a lordly person-
age with an assured yet deferential aspect. Six
feet, or so, he stood on feet like fenders. A blue
serge rami and a Wreath of frangipani flowers com-
pleted his nursing kit. When I went to the hospital
that morning Laria, being head orderly, was gently
feeding a dying dysenteric with milk from a spoon.
He rose, and stood at attention. “Sinabada,” he
said, “I bin want two weeks for walkabout.” “Too
many sick boys,” I told him. “What for you want
walkabout now?” “I bin want burn down one
village.” “What for?” “One man he bin throw
stone along my father’s house.” Word had come
to him from Maiva, his home, three days down the
coast, that someone had landed a stone on his old
man’s Papuan roof (which is a pourri-pourri, and
means that the head of the house will die unless the
magic is laid). Laria proposed to lay it by walking
into the bush and burning down the first village he
came to. Which would have been extremely in-
convenient for me and the sick boys in hospital.
“Ding Bat”: Anyone reading “Tiaki’s”
par. (B. 4/12/’l3) would imagine that there are
quite a number of white girls living with Maoris.
This is not so. I claim tc( know the Maoris as well
as most pakehas, and I, can recall but tw r o instances
of a white girl being an inmate of a pa. Anyway,
there is not such a lot to get excited about, even if
the girl tattoos herself. The Maori must not be
confounded with the “blackfellcr.” He is a moder-
ately intelligent and moral being as a rule. As for
tattooing. A few years ago it was quite the propah
thing in London. Maori men do not tattoo them-
selves these days, but the women still do, and, for
the life of me I can’t see why they should stop it.
Many a person has been swindled with a bogus Old
CONSISTENT.
ECCENTRIC GENIUS: “How do I do those mad
little sketches? Well, to tell the truth,
old boy, I've got to be drunk before I can
do 'em."
CANDID FRIEND: "Hum! And I suppose the
editor's got to be drunk before he can
accept 'em?”
Master, and has paid out good money for a Rem-
brandt which was really a John Smith. But the
picture that is painted on a girl is always genuine.
No man in his senses tries to persuade you that the
design on the brown handmaiden, aged 18, was the
work of Velasquez or Cimabue. The habit of paint-
ing pictures on girls tends to honesty in business
circles. If only girls could be hitched on to old
furniture, so that the visible years of the female
would help to guarantee the genuineness of the
alleged Louis XV. cabinet, some of us would be less
badly defrauded than we are.

ON THE PREVALENCE OF “BILL,” ETC., IN
AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How we wish the clever writers *
Of our prose and of our verse
For their characters would take a wider range !
There are some which keep recurring
Like a decimal—we curse
Their recurrence, and we’re aching for a change.
Wo are weary of the legend
Where the sergeant of police
Loves the fascinating sister of a “crook,”
And condones a lot of felonies
And breaches of the peace,
And won’t prosecute when cattle have been “shook.”
People say, “It’s so Australian!”
And some similar event
May have happened long ago as in the tale,
But police are not romantic
Now —at least to that extent—
And the “crooks” they cop are handed to the gaol.
There’s the big, gum-booted digger—
Crimson-shirted, with the sash
Winch he wore when Ballarat first played the game.
And he’s nearly always doing
Something venturesome and rash
When he isn’t “slinging mullock” in his claim.
All the writers since the “ ’fifties”
Have delighted in this type,
Who is always big and masterful and flash.
And, whatever he is doin’—
Diggin’—dancin’—stewin’ tripe—•
Why, he always wears the shirt and boots and sash.
There’s the beauteous bush maiden—
Though her father keeps a pub,
In the local estimation she is IT !—■
And she rides unbroken “brumbies”
Through impenetrable scrub —-
An exasperating female, you’ll admit.
She is cultured and accomplished,
And with virtue she’s supplied
In accordance with a lavish kind of scale.
So, when tempted by the squatter,
She prefers to be the bride
Of a humble chap who runs the local mail.
Ah! these types are too familiar,
They disturb our peace of mind ;
But the one which makes us actually ill,
Is that weird, elusive bushman—
He’s in every tale, you’ll find—
And he bears the simple sobriquet of “Bill.”
This great prevalence of William
Makes our indignation boil —
Every reader of Australian fiction knows
How he prances through the poems
Which are “racy of the soil,”
While he positively permeates our prose.
He’s a shepherd, he’s a shearer,
He’s a breaker-in of nags,
And he always swims some river in a flood.
But he wrecks our nervous system,
And reduces it to rags,
’Till we really feel we want to have his blood i
He’s a stockman, he’s a drover —
He’s on any kind of “lay”
Which may chance to suit the man who slings the
ink —
But he always plays the hero
In an offhand kind of way—
That’s enough to make a reader take to drink.
There is game and there is glory
To be gathered by the bard,
Or the fiction-manufacturer who will
Write a stirring backbloclc story
(Oh! we know it will be hard!)
Or a poem that is innocent of Bill.

IRONBARK.


BEALE PIANOS.
The fa& that to-day we are the largest piano firm doing business in the Commonwealth is due solely to the
quality of our instruments.
No effort has been spared in the manufacture of Beale Pianos to reach perfection of tone and ensure
durability. To-day our instruments stand absolutely unrivalled in those respects.
Beale Pianos are specially designed and made to meet all the exigencies of the Australian climate. They
embody every improvement known in piano construction, and are made under the direct supervision of an expert who
has made scientific piano manufacture a life study. In addition, they possess special features which yon cannot get in
other pianos ; such as our permanent steel tuning-system, hexagonal bass-strings, patent cast-in hitch-pins, and our
patent method of building up the casework.
The Beale Permanent Steel Tuning System renders what was hitherto the weakest part of a piano the strongest.
In every Beale Piano the, wrest-plank is made of solid iron. The wrest-plank is that part of the piano into which are
driven the tuning pins to which are attached the wires (or “strings”). In every imported piano the wrest-plank is
made of wood, which has to bear the strain (about 20 tons) of all the wires when the piano is in tune. So that in every
piano that has a wooden wrest-plank there is a probability of the wrest-plank splitting and the piano becoming untunable
in consequence. And in every piano but the Beale the wrest-plank is made of wood.
In all Beale Pianos the wrest-plank is solid iron, a part of the iron frame itself.
Write for our special booklets explaining this matter in detail.
We have recently put on the market the Beale Player-Piano. The Beale Player-Piano possesses the finest
mechanism it is possible to produce, fitted in a Beale high-grade piano of handsome appearance. The artistic possi-
bilities of the interpretation of a roll on the Beale Player-Piano are limited only by the artistic temperament of the
performer. The mechanism is so delicately regulated and every control so perfect that it is easier to play than any other
piano-player.
FREE EIFE INSURANCE: We supply, when requested, a Free Life Insurance Policy, without any charge
whatever, to buyers of Beale Pianos. This covers the life of the customer during the course of hire-purchase, and
insures a valuable and saleable asset to the family without further payment in case of bereavement. The Policy is a
purely free gift from Beale and Co., Ltd., so that no other person may claim under it than the person named by the
customer when accepted by us.
All Beale Pianos carry our written guarantee for Twenty-five Years.
A Beale Piano is lower in price, quality for quality, than any other piano you can buy, and in after cost it is
also cheaper, because it requires far less tuning and less frequent expert attention in every way.
PARTS : Should you by accident damage your Beale Piano we can always replace any injured or broken
parts at a very low cost to you, because we are the actual makers, with our factory facilities here in Australia. But if
you buy an imported piano, and it gets damaged, you will find it expensive to repair, because the agents have no factory
facilities here and they do not carry stocks of spare parts.

too highly of it. It gave me immediate relief, and
quickly cured me.”*

WOMAN OF 70 HAS A FACE LIKE
THAT OF A YOUNG GIRL.
LONG-GUARDED FAMILY SECRET
LEARNED THROUGH A PROVIN-
CIAL LADY.
“From mother to daughter, generation
after generation,” writes a lady now 70
years old, “we have been noted throughout
the little provincial town where we live for
the beauty of our complexions, preserved
even to old age. Of late so many of our
friends seem to have been deceived and dis-
appointed by harmful skin remedies that we
have decided it is not right for us to keep to
ourselves any longer the formula that has
always been considered as our family secret,
and to which we owe our ‘eternal youth.’
Therefore we take this opportunity of com-
municating it to our sister readers. Simply
take 2oz. rosewater, 1 dram tincture of ben-
zoin and 2oz. Flowers of Oxzoin, and mix
them yourself at home. Any chemist can
supply you with what is necessary. Shake
the lotion before using and apply with a
clean piece of cotton wool or a sponge regu-
larly night and morning. In less than a
week you will surely be asked what has
caused such a wonderful improvement in
your appearance. The freshness of your
complexion will be dazzling. We know be-
cause we have often made the very same ex-
periment among our friends, and this is the
only thing we ourselves have ever used. It
is our family remedy for all complexion
troubles, and has never failed to give the
very highest degree of satisfaction; in fact,
we consider it an ideal means for preserving
the natural health of the skin. The formula
is old-fashioned, simple and inexpensive, but
always efficacious. We would be very happy
to give you others, but this is the only one
we possess of which we know the benefits
from personal experience.”
Important: Inquiries recently made of a
noted dermatologist proved conclusively that
the above lotion is unequalled for the pur-
poses for which it is recommended, and it
may therefore be regarded as being
thoroughly reliable.*
“Snell”: Foster sleeps out. He had a
cunning little verandah attached to one corner of
the front of his new residence for the purpose, and
settled down to the custom with fond expectations.
He was convinced sleeping out would steady his
nerves, improve his appetite, increase his bulk, and
knock 10 years off his age. But he finds there are
disadvantages. He is a little too near the highway,
and acquaintances of a frivolous turn, When passing,
can throw items on him as he sleeps—to wit, clods,
drowned kittens, old boots, frogs, cat’s-meat, ling-
fish, brambles, lobsters no longer fit for home con-
sumption, oyster shells, meatpies, saveloys and just
dirt. Ail these things have arrived to date, singly
and in bulk. But Foster hopes to live down this
disgusting familiarity. There are further drawbacks,
however. One of these is Craig. Foster does not
know Craig, but Craig is a familiar feature at the
Corner pub, where he is at home to friends between
the hours of seven and midnight. It was two o’clock
in the morning—a hot morning, too—when Foster
awoke, feeling devilishly oppressed. He had a vague
idea that he Was being Overlain, and that his hours
Were numbered. His impressions Were not Wholly
inaccurate. There was a man in the bed, Foster fought
his way from under, relieved himself of the heat and
burden, and then ejaculated, expostulated and threat-
ened vengeance. The man in the bed muttered and
moaned, and turned over twice. He was much bigger
than Foster, and he had his boots on. In an argu-
ment in bed the combatant in boots has a marked
advantage. The stranger had removed several articles
of wearing apparel, and they, with sundry empty
bottles, were scattered over Foster’s tender new
lawn; but he retained his coat, his boots and his
hat. The householder was furious, but he was,small.
When he made an effort to dislodge the intruder he
felt like a woolly caterpillar trying to get away
With a rooted gravestone. When he argued the inter-
loper merely mumbled in his sleep. Foster switched
on the light, and took Craig by the leg and endeav-
ored to haul him off the cot; but Craig straight-
ened his hind extremity suddenly, and shot Foster
into a corner, battering his head viciously against a
brick. Holding his head on with one hand, and
his pyjamas up with the other, the householder went
forth into the night, seeking police protection. He
returned with his feet full of thistle splinters and
old glass, and resumed the argument. Craig refused
to admit that anything was to be gained by discus-
sion. His only remark was wholly irrelevant. He said :
V orgorsakegosleepM’riar !” Then Foster went indoors,
and bedded himself down on the drawing-room carpet.
Hut he could not sleep, and at daylight, full of bit-
terness and other unchristian feelings, he tackled his
Unwelcome bedmate again. All to no purpose. Then
Foster removed what bedding he could from under
and about his unbidden guest, and turned the garden
hose on him. A few people, out early, or homing
late, gathered at the front fence to watch the
small man astride his verandah-rail liberally hosing
a large fat victim who wallowed about in the brim-
ming bed evidently having the time of his life.
Foster expended many gallons of water before Craig
A LEGAL QUERY.

Oi should sind me little daughter for six-
penn’orth av whisky in a bottle, an ’ she
doesn’t git it, an ’ falls down an' breaks it
am Oi loiable?"
was convinced. Eventually, however, the rash intruder
did swim out. He stood swaying in the stream, look-
ing at Foster in a puzzled, reproachful way; then
he dredged his coat-pocket, found a threepenny-bit
and offered it to Foster. “Here,” he said, “here’sh
shilling for bed, but damned if I’ll pay for the
bath!” Then he collected his belongings off the lawn,
dressed himself in a corner and went home.

Australoria” : They say that when a man
can’t spit the limits of his dryness have been
reached, but I know different since yesterday. The
evidence was a piece of wreckage tossed high and
dry after a booze storm on the front beach of the
pub. Never have I seen such a distressful eye in
a man. When I asked him to have a drink, his
thanks crackled like parchment. “Pint,” he said
to the beer slavey, then, reaching for a water jug,
he drained it. “Don’t you want the beer?” I
asked. “Rather,” he whispered, “but I want to
soak me mouth so I kin taste it.”
ACTING ON THE SUGGESTION.
A meeting was held at the rooms of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animils vester
day to discuss a suggestion which has for its object the granting of a holiday to horses.— item
SAD PUNTER : “Is he to do his best?”
KID ON TOP: “Lor', no. ’E’s only out for a Holiday.”
“Pete”: As “Pick” (P. 11/12/T3) desires
the information, let me tell him that crows trans-
port goods as perhaps “Pick” does his pint, viz.,
with their claws. When a youngster on the Upper
Murray I have repeatedly seen and chased the black
imps after they had robbed a nest, and they always
used their claws when lifting the proceeds, whether
of hen, turkey or goose variety. When flying, they
carried the egg closely tucked up to the body.
“McNorth”: If the Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals has a spare moment
it might do worse than turn its attention to the
atrocities of Binghi. The North Queensland binghi’s
plain and ornamental cold-blooded cruelty to heip-
less creatures surpasses
anything I have ever
heard of. Such out-
rages as the plucking
of a live scrub-hen or
turkey, or the cutting
up of a squirming fish
-for bait, are common.
But Binghi excels him-
self in cruelty when
he has turtle for
lunch. He just turns
the unfortunate shell-
back over on the beach
and casually carves a
piece out of its stom-
ach with a blunt
knife. He doesn’t
bother about killing it
first. The carving
process is very grad-
ual, and while it is
going on Mrs. Binghi
and the kids and dogs
wallow in the gaping
aperture, quite indif-
ferent to the groans
and struggles of the
turtle. Frequently the
autopsy is stayed for
an hour or so while
the herd of blood-
stained dogs and nig-
gers devour the first
cut of quivering meat,
so that the partially
disembowelled turtle
has its agony still fur-
ther prolonged. No
one interferes. The
ways of the black are
sacred. I know of one instance when a, Government
officer (ex officio, an assistant-Protector of Abori-
gines) stood by and watcheyl the whole horrible
business described above, and uttered no word of
protest.
“Marere” : Henare was sent from Gisborne
by his Maori brethren to interview the Minister for
Works in Wellington about a bridge. He returned
a fortnight later and reported: “By Cripes!” he said,
“te first man I meet in Wellington is Timi Kara.
He very pleased to see me. We go to Parliament
House. Timi introduce me to Mr. Bellamy, who keep
te Parliament Pub. We have te drink. Irish
whisky. Timi shout. He te fine feller, Timi. He te
best man I ever know. Mr. Bellamy shout. Timi
shout again. Mr,. Bellamy shout again. He te fine
feller, Mr. Bellamy. My word! Irish whisky te
good whisky. Tom McKenzie come in. Timi intro-
duce me. Tom the fine feller, too. Tom shout te
Scotch whisky. By cripes! that te good whisky.
We have te Irish whisky, te Scotch whisky, and
Mr. Bellamy’s whisky. By cripes! Wellington te
fine place. I have te good time.” Just here Wiremu
inquired: “Wot about te pridge, Henare?” “Aw, te
pridge! I dunno. I never see tat cow at all.”
A.G.M.”: Bullocky Bill had signed a
contract to deliver a 22-ton boiler at a certain place
on a certain date; if the boiler didn’t arrive on
time, no cheque for William. The journey was
begun on good roads, but soon the team struck a
track which was soft from recent rain. The boiler
had been loaded too far forward and was driving
the little wheels down and making the hauling twice
as heavy and the going half as fast, so that the
chances of delivering on time looked about as blue
as our great Liberal party. There was nothing for
it but to • shift the load. You might think that
was difficult for one man, but then you don’t know
the kind of man Bill is. He just dived into the
scrub, axe in hand, and presently emerged with four
long stout saplings, one at a time. These he leaned
across the load in two pairs, tent-wise, one pair
for’ard and one aft, so that the tops of each pair
intersected, and he passed chains round the boiler
and up to the intersections and braced up good and
hard so that there was no slack. Then William
got to work with the thing he is alleged to call a
“blanky shovel” and dug away the earth from under
the four wheels till he had lowered the waggon
about three inches, and the boiler swung clear in
the air. The rest was easy. His two polers drew
the waggon a couple of feet forward, and the boiler
was then lowered away on to its proper position, good
and snug. Ten minutes later an optimistic bullocky
hit out merrily on the trail after his cheque, with
his 22-ton parcel riding easy. Which shows that
if you can’t lift a thing off the earth you can pro-
bably lift the earth away from under it.
“Killie”: The silken Union Jack which
had been swapped by the public school in our town
with the similarly-named town in the old Mother-
land had arrived, and was about to be unfurled in
the presence of the local inhabitants and adjacent
cocky families. The shire councillor was in the
chair, and I enclose his speech in order that it mav
be entered on the records: —
Ladies and gentlemen, we have all mustered here
this evenin’ to show our great respects to the great
nag that for thousands of years has braved the
battle, and the breeze (cheers). I ain’t much at
talkm politics. I would sooner talk ter yer about
poddies and the state of our roads, which is scan-
dalous, and the takin’ away of the shire’s subsidy,
not speakin’ about the Rooral Workers (violent
nudge). Right! As I was sayin', this glorious dag
which I am going to ask my wife to unfurl is one of
the most glorious ties that ever tied flesh and blood
together. (Cheers and squealing of infants.) It's
all right, Mrs. —- —, never mind the baby. He ain’t
armin’ me. I like it. I got 10 of ’em meself and
proud of it. Well, as time is now gettin’ very short
I will now ask Mrs. to unfurl the dear old flag
and before she does it would like ter tell you all,
young an’ old, that the only way to keep the dear
old flag wavin’ ’igh above yer ’eads is by work—’ard
work ! Go to bed when the chickens go and get up
in time to' wake the cows up, and yer won’t go far
wrong. I don’t know much about foreign
languages, but I remember something what has
always stuck ter me, an’ that is something that was
stuck up c>n our wall at school. It was “Labor vincit
omnibus ,” which means “ ’ard work beats every-
thing.” (Cheers.)
I don’t know whether he finished there or not. I
did a Gaby Glide.

“Knocker-line” : The Australian cocky who
breeds a foal or two each year is hopelessly biassed
towards the “imp.” fetich. He glances over a stal-
lion’s pedigree, and unless “imp.” occurs every other
line he looks upon the sire as an “Australian mon-
grel,” and doesn’t engage its services. Veterinary
Lecturer F. E. Place, B.V. Sc., M.R.C.V.S., in a
recent article in the S.A. Journal op Agriculture,
wrote: “The heavy loams of Lincolnshire and the
shires were the occasion for the heavy-muscled,
strong-limbed Shire horse; while the hills and dales
along the Clyde influenced the evolution of the
strong-framed but more active Clydesdale. .. .Neither
of these conditions”— i.e., “heavy loams” and “hills
and dales”—“exist in S.A., yet the Clydesdale and
the Shire are the types that are favored for a country
in which the paddocks are level, or, if on the rise,
are very light to work.” To evolve a type of horse
most suitable for conditions in Australia the cocky
should therefore get a bit more of the “local en-
vironment” into his stock. But it is hard work to
drive this into his head; for, as the same lecturer
IT'S AN ILL WIND THAT, etc., etc.
Apropos the Privy Council’s relegation of the Royal
Commissions Act to the ash-barrel.
THE CHIEF MOURNER : “Ah, well, p-p'raps
it's all for the bub-best.”
THE OBSERVANT OUTSIDER (to himself—en-
thusiastically): "My oath—it is!”
says, “ ‘home’ ties have a preponderating influence
in the choice, and there is a reverential awe for
that blessed word ‘imp.’ ” As Place writes the
blessed word “imp.” after his own name, cocky
might reasonably give a little attention to what he
says.
THE VERSATILE FIEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ihe motor-car is responsible for an enormous ex-
tensaon of the week-end habit. The clergy complain
that the week-end habit is loosening the ties that
bound the well-to-do classes to the church.... Motor-
ists, flitting from place to place at the week-ends, do
not attend Divine service. In the spring and the
summer, when the weather is so favorable for motor-
mg, there is a considerable falling off in the church
attendance of people of means .—Melbourne Age.
The dear old Devil I have known
For forty years in many guises.
The red, sardonic lord of woe
Whom Mr. Goethe advertises
Is not the Devil I have seen—
He is a man of modern mien,
Who lures the maids with kindly glances
At small and cheap suburban dances.
The devils that the parsons make
Are those with whom I am acquainted—
An actor once, with natty shape,
Well-corseted and richly painted,
W r ho turns from holiness away
The ewe-lambs with his wretched play,
Or leads the old to Tophet’s valley
With some dull, limping, bran-stuffed ballet.
He turns to musical device,
And ruins us with airs from “Carmen";
Or tempts us Hellward in a trice
As courtliest and best of barmen ;
As some wight, commonplace and fat,
In fresh boiled shirt and Paris hat,
With vaudeville he shocks the Grundies, ,
Or runs a picture shown on Sundays.
He lectured as a grey old gent.
To deadbeat or to Yarra loafer.
But now, the saints to circumvent,
The Devil has become a chauffeur.
Behind him, on a cushioned perch.
He whirls the rich away from church.
The Church keeps one old-fashioned level—
He’s always up-to-date—the Devil!

The fact that some of your teeth are
decayed although you have always cleaned them is proot
that the preparations you have used —probably tooth powders
or pastes —do not preserve the teeth.
Tooth powders or pastes can never under any circum-
stances, preserve the teeth from destruction. That follows
from the simple fact that the parts most exposed to injury—
the backs of the molars, the interstices between the teeth, and
the cavities in them—are exactly those which remain untouched
by either powders or pastes. And therefore, mischief once
commenced in these places, advances undisturbed.
But Odol, being liquid, can penetrate the minutest
crevices, and, as it has a real antiseptic effect lasting for
hours, arrests all bacterial and fermentation processes which
destroy the teeth.

This year’s Sydney Show will open on April 17
and go the usual eight days. The prize list, run-
ning to £7OOO, shows few changes of consequence.
In the cattle section more encouragement is given
to pure breeds, which is a doubtful improvement.
“Pure breed” means the breed which some other
country has evolved to suit its own conditions; and
it is quite possible that Australia has yet to produce
its own best “pure breed” by the same process of
crossing and selection —just as it is doing with
wheats. As to wheats, by the way, the Agricultural
Society makes a standing offer to pay £1 for every
three-bushel bag which has won a first prize at a
country show and is entered for competition in
Sydney.

“General Average”: “O.K.’s” statement (B. 8/l/’l4)
that “millions of tenants pay fire insurance pre-
mium all their lives and get never a sixpence from
the companies” sounds very much like the wail of
the man who let his accident policy lapse because
while he paid premiums he had never been lucky
enough to break his leg. The assured pays for cover;
and who wants better odds than a hundred pounds
to half a crown? Naturally, if “a miraculous epi-
demic of fires in brick dwelling houses” should
occur, rates would rise. And why shouldn’t they,
if the risk becomes greater? Oil and color stores
are naturally bad risks, and there have been fires in
too many of them lately in most of the Australian
capitals ; and if this puts rates up, the circum-
stances will warrant it. There are two considera-
tions for the assurer; the physical risk and the
moral risk, and in the face of recent experiences
the companies are justified in looking at both con-
siderations with a cold and calculating eye. To
put “O.K.’s” insurance theory on another basis —
think o' nil the people who have paid for the
support of a police force, and have never been
rescued half-dead from an infuriated homicide by
John Hop!
* * * *
The Oldest Inhabitant; A draper’s jubilee is
being celebrated this year. In 1864 Mrs. Way
started a millinery shop in Pitt-street where some
thirty-odd years previously a Mrs. William Nash
also flourished. In those days, in such businesses,
the wife’s name was generally used —the “man mil-
liner” had not become fashionable. When Mrs. Way
hung out her modest sign 50 years ago there were
17 shops, variously occupied, -between it and the
Victoria Theatre. To-day the same space is filled
by three drapery firms —another instance of the
growth of the big business and the crowding-out of
the little tradesman.
“N. or M.”: J. Hudson, first mate of the Rachel
Cohen —the barquentine that got so mixed up with
gales and blizzards and icebergs last winter when
trying to get stores down to Mawson’s party on
Macquarie Island—has patented an invention for
increasing the speed of vessels by decreasing the
water-resistance. Experiments with the oil launch
Mona, at Wellington, seem to show that the thing
works in practice as well as theory, the increase
of speed in this case being, so it is alleged, from
seven to nine knots. Two open tubes traverse the
hull below the waterline, from the bow about two-
thirds of the way to the stern, and slope gently
away from the bow. The inventor’s claim is that
the water which rushes through these tubes lessens
resistance and steadies the boat, at the same time
increasing its buoyancy by upward pressure on the
inner surface of the tubes. It sounds all right. But,
then, did you ever hear an inventor’s story that
sounded all wrong?
* * * *
“Wonga”: What is the betting that an aerial ferry
service isn’t established before the bridge is built
across Sydney Harbor ? Articles of incorporation
have been filed in ’Frisco by a company which says
it is going to carry passengers in flying boats between
the city and Oakland, the other side of the bay.
The trip will take six minutes.
* * * *
“Hamer”: There is going to be trouble in the
Sydney building trades early in the year unless the
wildly unexpected occurs. For over 12 months
the Building Trades Federation has been figuring out
the best way to get uniform hours and conditions in
its line of business. After January 1 the real cam-
paign will start, and from then _ onwards, wherever,
on a jerry-building or other job, it is discovered that
bricklayer Bill Jones is not a member of the Union,
forthwith not only the bricklayers but also the
unionised hodcarriers, crane-men, laborers, car-
penters, etc., will down tools. The beauty of the
scheme from the toiler’s viewpoint lies in the fact
that even if there is not a single union carpenter or
hodcarrier on the job, there will be sufficient union-
ists in the other callings to hold things up in the
interests of carpenters and hodcarriers who are
unionists.
* * * *
“Far North”: I want to put that very good sport,
Agar Wynne, Commonwealth P.M.G., on to two rot-
ten legacies left to his department by the States.
One is the bad old way of doing business in outback
post offices, where Jim the postmaster tells Bill the
commission agent all the news of the mail and tele-
graph. In a place or two in the Northern Territory
the leakage is over the odds. Often some man in the
street knows the contents of a private wire before
the addressee has taken delivery. Another legacy is
the outback parcels post. Up near here the law of
Queensland still obtains. For the benefit of fat and
influential city merchants the mailman’s heart _ is
broken in carrying merchandise to compete with
local storekeepers who have to bring their goods up
by waggon at great cost. Afghans and other hawkers
make their stock up into small packages and ship it
as mail. Even the horse-mailman carries a hundred-
weight of catalogues and samples to addressees who
have never ordered them, and often refuse to accept
them after they have been dragged anything over
100 miles of rough country on a packhorse. There
should be discrimination in the carriage of commer-
cial papers. Where these uninteresting and mostly
lying catalogues have to be carried by coacli mail,
the postage should be Gd. an ounce. Where the per-
jured literature has to be delivered by horse mail,
postage should be Is. a carat or 9d. per lie.
* * * *
“Hamer”: After next July the boats of the Messa-
geries Maritime Co. will cease to travel to and from
Australia —as passenger vessels. During the ’7os
the M.M. boats were the crack steamships east of
Suez. But they stood still, and the N.D.L. liners
grew in tonnage and luxury and speed, and the P.
and O. did likewise, and so did the Orient ships ; and
now the M.M. vessels have become aged, slow and
evil-smelling back numbers. For years the only good
thing aboard them has been the food. The M.M.
liners were unique in the number of “classes” they
used to carry. There were six; and as, while the
first-salooners could travel all over the deck and the
second-salooners on all the decks except the holy re-
serve of the first class, the sixth class was limited to
its own few feet of deck space, the divisions, on such
a boat as the old Tanais, for instance, were pretty
cramped. Still, the system allowed certain sorts of
mentally afflicted people to travel very cheaply and
yet retain a feeling that they were several classes
superior to someone else.
* * * *
The N. S. Wales cow cocky is busy cutting his
own throat—or slitting up his own pocket, which
he probably regards as a much more serious opera-
tion. He has had the good sense to establish co-
operative creameries and butter factories; but he is
such a poor co-operator, as a rule, that when the
Private Enterprise serpent tempts him with a tem-
porary fraction of a farthing more per lb., he either
sends the business to the serpent or turns the cream
sour in his own factory with his acid remarks. The
result is that harassed co-operative factory managers,
who ought to be in a position to aim at the best,
give the grumbling cocky the benefit of loose grading,
and pass in, as prime, cream which is only second-
class ; and the result of that is that the butter which
ought to be prime is only second-class too. At the
last big London Butter Show various N.S.W. North
Coast factories, which formerly did well, did very
badly ; and the fact that it was the flavor that wasn’t
right takes us back to the unprofitable greed of the
blind cocky who, to squeeze an extra sixteenth of a
penny out of a factory, establishes there a system
of loose grading. When margarine gets further on
to the market, and pushes his second-class stuff right
over the edge, the greedy cocky will probably
recognise that he has made a fool of himself and
done the country a heap of damage incidentally.
No, on second thoughts, he won’t realise the latter
proposition. He knows there is a cow, but he
doesn’t know there is a country—not even incident-
ally.

“Bullinbah”: Riley was dozing in the shade of
certain bushes fringing the beach at Cairns (N.Q.),
when two Jap. fishermen came ashore, buried three
bulky bags in the sand, and departed as they arrived
per fishing boat. Riley investigated, and found many
tins of opium, for which he promptly provided an-
other hiding-place. His balance at the bank being
as low as the shores of the Dead Sea, he took into
his confidence a local barber and publican, who put
up the exes, for a first-class trip to Townsville, and
gave him the address of a sure Chow buyer. Riley
landed the stuff 0.K., but the sure and positive
Chow was up-country. That, however, didn’t deter
Riley. He walked into the first Chinese store he
saw (to Riley all Chows were opium slaves) and
made a deal; he was to bring the goods round at
9 p.m. and get £3 10s. per tin. A meek Pong with
a £3 10s. expression in his eye opened the door at
9 p.m., and Riley walked into the arms of three
Customs officers. Riley’s Chow was the president of
the local Anti-Opium League! The fine was £lOO,
and the stuff was confiscated. The barber-publican
at Cairns paid up in order to keep his name out
of the business, but now Riley can doze on the
beach anywhere between Cape York and Melbourne,
and find opium, gold, jewels and wrecked ships, and
not one capitalist will finance him. The word has
gone round that he can’t be trusted with large
financial operations, he being an ass.
* * * *
“Snell”: Let me hear no more of the precision,
energy and acumen of the business man! I have
had more to do with splendid men of business
during the last three months than in all my life
before, and in not one of about 30 dealings was any
amount of precision, energy or acumen displayed by
the man with the goods. He was in every case any-
thing from three days to a month behind with every-
thing, and in six cases out of 10, when the commodi-
ties, apparatus and matters were dumped, said wares,
liquids and things were either the wrong items, or
they were articles suffering from careless handling
and mental defects, or the tooth of time. When I
appealed to the stupendous intellect that was super-
vising a warehouse with the pomposity of a Napoleon
the Greater, it fell into a sort of helpless fatuity. It
didn’t know. It couldn’t possibly imagine—in fact,
something must have happened. Then the tun of
brains got to work to do it all oyer again, and
mostlv jt did it wrong seven days behind the date
specified. Give me no more of it! I wonH have
the great, accurate business intellect as anything but
a dull chimera. Those shockingly unbusiness-like
people, the poets, authors, painters and musicians,
almost invariably know their own game, and get after
it with absolute directness. The poets who don’t
know poetry, the painters who do not know paint, go
out on their necks. And these imposing commercial
humbugs use the term “business-like” as if business
were next to godliness, going up.
“Leo Lear”: The time is long over-ripe for violent
official remarks to the frequent jury that trifles with
its oath in stock-stealing cases. A cattle duffer
commands more sympathy in country districts than
even a sly-grog dispenser in a “dry” area. He is
usually a first-class horseman and bushman, and a
free hand at dealing out joints or steak among
neighbors, after a periodical raid on some station
beef; likewise, he seldom, except in the case of a
feud, touches a poor man’s beast. Once, after a
quarrel, I heard a hardened “lifter” say to a neigh-
bor : “You’ll find me the biggest blanky tick on the
Dawson.” So he was, and still is, for that matter,
never having been convicted, though “had up ’ half a
dozen times. Take up almost any daily paper and
you’ll see loss of stock by duffing. Then comes an
arrest and trial, followed by an acquittal by the
jury, after damaging evidence. In Bananaland I’ve
known men select five acres of land for a homestead
in the vicinity of cattle stations, and a few years
after own 200 breeding cows, not one of which was
purchased. These were run rent free on any lease
that happened to be handy; though I’ve no doubt any
ordinary jury would swallow the pseudo-owner’s state-
ment that his five acres were capable of carrying
the lot all the year round, droughts included. There
are some States —Victoria, for instance—that encour-
age stock-lifting by the absence of any proper Brands
'Act. In Watt’s domain a person can brand with any
old smudge he takes a fancy to, and there are
often 12 marks similar to his own within a radius
of 30 miles. So, as far as recognition _of _ wan-
dering stock by their brand goes, the thing is similar
to identifying a runaway tramcar by the shape of
its wheels. On the other hand, in Queensland, if a
beast from Dalby happened to be spirited to
Oloncurry, and bore no other brand to show a change
of boss than the owner’s registered one, the animal
is at once located in the Brands Book, and the
Dalby resident has a chance of regaining his prop-
erty. A uniform scheme of branding won’t do away
with duffing, but it helps; and where the jury system
is so smellful a lot of help is necessary.
A FINANCIAL CHANTEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It may be asked how the increase in the expendi-
ture has been kept down relatively. In the corres-
ponding half of 1912, £211,890 was appropriated for
sinking fund on the debt, and that liar now been
knocked off. Then, £140,887 less has contri-
buted towards local government, and, apart from
these reductions, the expenditure has increased
£183,115.
That the rate of expenditure on Loan Account has
been fully kept up is evident from the next state-
ment. Nothing has been charged to the Raikvay
Duplications Account in the half-year, but those
works have been paid for out of the General Loan
Account. The loan outgoings have been at the rate
of close on £9,000,000 per annum.
— N.S.W. Financial Expert on the situation.
In Cohen Harbor our ships did ride—
(And a good job, too!)
When the Old Man, he fell over the side—
(And a good job, too!)
We flung out a buoy, and we lowered a boat,
And someone threw a Promissory Note —•
But «we didn’t believe the skipper would float,
So we’ll raise a loan to-morrow!
The Mate he steps to the forepeaks stay—
(An’ it’s cash we want!)
Says he: “We’ll borrow, and H — can pay!”
( Oh, it’s Cash we want!)
We were anchored fast, an’ the tide ran strong,
An’ everything ’boardship was wrong—
For the pay was short an’ the voyage long—
So we’ll raise a loan to-morrow.
Oh, the ’ands must graft, an’ the girls must
grieve—•
(For the Ship’s hard up !)
It ain’t all joy, as you may believe
(When the Ship’s hard up!)
There ain’t no chart of the course we’ve runned,
An’ it’s overboard with the Sinkin’ Fund !
An’ our credit’s broke, an’ we’re bein’ dunned,
But we’ll raise a loan to-morrow.
There’s rocks ahead, an’ there’s fog behind —
(All hands to the pumps!)
An’ Loandon Town’s in a damn queer mind—
(All hands to the pumps!)
The Old Man’s drowned —fish gnaw ’is bones —-
And the Sinkin’ Fund rests with Davy Jones —•
We’re ’ere in Port for a load of Loans —
(Gord send a Loan To-morrow!)

Do as I do, and always choose
Thorne’s Whisky. You’ll find it
the most satisfying spirit.
Thorne’s Whisky is made in the
heart of the Scottish highlands —at
Glenlivet, the traditional home of
good whiskies.
Its smooth, mellow flavor appeals to
the discriminating palate with grati-
fying effect. Its sterling quality
never varies because of the care with
which it is produced—the skilful
blending, patient maturing and
ageing give it every attribute
perfect whisky should possess.
So Thorne’s Old Highland Malt
in the “Black Square” bottle has
been considered
Incomparable
for 80 Years.

POLITICAL
POINTS
THE TRUSTS
INTRODUCE
THEMSELVES.
America is on the verge of a general open revolt,
as the populace is disgusted at the throttling opera-
tions of the various trusts.— Sydney Telegraph.
THE TRUSTS: “I'm the gentleman you so
kindly barracked for last year."
An industrial upheaval which was just
large enough to deserve half a dozen lines of
print was the proposal made by a small
meeting of large men in Sydney to strike
against payment' of income-tax. The pro-
posal was born dead, amid shrieks of mirth
from the large men who didn’t join in. The
fat person has an absurdly high opinion of
himself in many respects, but about his
capacity for playing the game of insurrec-
tion, all off his own stomach so to speak, he
has few delusions.
A dauntless politician is Hutchinson,
M.L.A., who had to get re-elected for Borung
(Vic.) when Watt included him in the new
Ministry. He told a meeting last week that
“the proper time to have opposed him was
at next general election, hut lie would not
run aioay from the fight." But for Hut-
chinson’s plucky determination to fight for
his job, the other fellow would have scored
a bloodless victory.
Joe Cook attended the first sitting of the
Inter-State Commission, and was vastly
edified thereat. Said he :
The contrast between the way these matters used
to be dealt with in Parliament and the course taken
by the Commission was very marked indeed. The
marvel is that the tariff has so long been made the
football of politicians.
Which truism applies equally to other ques-
tions hitherto controlled by Parliament
cursed with the party system. Also
the comment will be worth recalling
when the Commission’s recommendations
come before Parliament.
Being an M.P. isn’t all beer and cheese.
For their sins, which are many, the members
of the Vic. State Assembly had lately to
listen while one of their number threw this
at Premier Watt:—
Strange you should make those points so vital,
Quick-change artist might well be your title.
Poems of love and friendship at Christmas all revere,
But you will be asking for mercy from electors when
you appear.
The pack behind you looking meek as Sunday-school
kids,
Grabbing at shadows for honors and quids;
Changing in looks, policy never the same;
Joining with any if it looks good game.
It probably helps to explain why the House
hurried into recess. It was afraid of
another poem.
Seeing that almost everybody in the
N.S.W. Labor party is a candidate for elec-
tion to what Henry Parkes used to call
“lioffis,” it ought now to be a simple matter
to abolish the caucus and let the whole
Assembly elect the Ministry. Then the
entire Legislature would be available for
“hoffis.” The idea of Elective Ministries _is
good and logical, but on the democratic prin-
ciple of one-man-one-vote every M.L.A.
should have a voice in the election. It is a
hopelessly conservative idea to disfranchise
a large section of the electors. With one-
man-one-vote in the Assembly the Ministry
might reasonably be fixed for three years,
just as the Assembly, elected on the same
democratic vote by the adult population, is
fixed for three years. But the' disfranchised
section of the Assembly naturally claims the
right of insurrection, just as does a dis-
franchised section of the population. Con-
sequently there is confusion, upheaval, in-
coherence, uncertainty, blither, procrastina-
tion, interruption and all manner of trouble.
When the eloquent, plausible, shuffling, side-
stepping Premier Holman, of N.S.W., is quite
finished talking vague platitudes
about decentralisation, will he
kindly expound his views about a
short railway to connect Twofold
Bay with Monaro and Riverina,
and a still shorter line to connect
the northern part of the State with
Port Stephens, also about a scheme
for establishing State-owned cities
at these places? Holman is a
pleasant person to listen to. He
is as eloquent as a silver trumpet.
He is as affable as a money-lender
or a billiard-shark. He slides as
easily as a pound of butter at
Bourke in the middle of summer.
He .gets round the corner as sud-
denly as the shadow of a lizard.
He waves his arms with all the
agility of a semaphore. But when
one tries to pin Holman down to
any definite information about some
of the allegedly most important
planks of the Labor platform, it is
like trying to put salt on the tail
of a rainbow.
A side issue of the South
African strike was the same mis-:
erable old side issue which hap-
pened some time ago at Brisbane;’
There was the union paper which
supported Labor and the non-union
one which didn’t. (Somehow there
seems to be always the non-union
paper, and it is often the richest
one in the place.) When the general strike
was declared the men on the union or
friendly paper. were called out, and the men
on the non-union or hostile one weren’t, be-
cause they wouldn’t come.
“Discrediting White Australia” was the
title of a leading roar in Sydney Telegraph
(14/1/T4)the theme of the tirade being
that a certain Chinese woman wasn’t allowed
to go ashore for a. few hours at Brisbane.
It was a hearty _ roar, with all the Tele-
soul in it, and it came from the
bottom of the Telegraph’s boots, and the
wind of it blew off the Telegraph’s hat.
Yet, when soap-man Lever discredited White
Australia, by declaring it an all-round failure,
the ’Graph wasn’t moved to the bitterness
of great anger. Which shows how much more
important in the Tory mind is a colored per-
son who is here to-day and dead to-morrow
than a whole continent which has come to
stay.
A perplexing circumstance in the great
South African strike has been the nigger.
There are several or more of him to every
white man. A certain “advanced” section
of Labor has an idea that all workers are
brothers, and the nigger has applauded this
view with energy. In his capacity as a
striker he felt like a man and an ally;
also he felt that he was helping one section
of the white community to biff the other sec-
tion, and in his capacity as a biffer he was
more or less coming into his own. A large
section of the strikers certainly regarded him
as a dangerous nuisance, who was always
liable to break loose and discredit the cause,
but he was there and couldn’t be got rid of.
When a man is followed home by a strange
dog eight times his own size it is always
difficult to get rid of the animal. One way
and another the numerous and unmanage-
able nigger is likely to be a little more
troublesome now than he used to be, and
that is saying a good deal.
THE MULTITUDE OF COUNSELLORS.
When we go across to the military side of the overloaded Defence Department’s central administra-
tion we find a collection of futilities and incompatibles even worse than exists in the naval branch.
Positions appear to have been made merely for the sake of finding billets. Several officers hold
commands the whole of which could be more effectively and economically filled by a single capable
administrator. The most trivial excuse is sufficient for the erection of a directorship or a chief of staff
or an inspector.— Melbourne Age.
THE KID: “I wonder whether all these blokes are here to watch me or watch each other."
The system of providing ready-made
farms for new settlers, as introduced into
Canada some years ago, has found favor in
the sight of Minister Tolmie, of Maoriland.
He proposes that his Government shall
go in for it next session. The supply of
immigrants, imported and home-grown, isn’t
bad, but there are not enough attractiohs
about the present system of dumping down
a wife and family on a 320-acre block and
leaving them to belt, amateur-fashion, into
THE ALL-BUT OPEN DOOR.
“How does Japan look upon Australia?” was asked,
and the new Japanese Consul-General replied: “If
you open the door there will be many glad to come
in.”
NIPPON: “Now I come to think of it, I might
open it myself. ”
the big timber. By cutting up a block of a
few square miles into farms, clearing and
ploughing a bit of each, and building houses
it is hoped to produce townships in record
time, and —amongst other things—to give
mum and the kids some company while the
crops are growing. Tolmie’s Government
will doubtless borrow the money for this
brilliant device.
The Trust does not do badly in Freetrade
Britain when it gets its seven-league boots
on and steps out. Coats, the concern which
just about monopolises the thread industry
in Bull’s Country, made a trifle over
£3,000,000 profit last year, and the dividend
on ordinary shares whooped mildly at the
elevation of 35 per cent. Half a million
was carried to reserves, making them nearly
£9,000,000. Capital is £10,000,000, and all
things in the little garden or flower-pot are
lovely.
If he doesn’t change his mind,
George Meudell will be a candi-
date for Melbourne City at the
October State elections. Meu-
dell is made of wire and whip-
cord. The very abundance of
his energy has often made him
diffuse in wrong directions, but
he is nearly grown-up now, and
acquiring that solidity generally
associated with duller citizens.
A few years ago some doctor
told him that his lungs were
about to kill him; so he went
up to Bendigo to die in pure air.
Before he died he thought he’d
leave new life behind by plant-
ing a lucerne patch and rearing
chickens; and he got so inter-
ested in these things that he for-
got all about the pulmonary
trouble and one day discovered
that the trouble was dead and
had attended its own funeral.
Meudell has a shrewd brain,
much first-hand information, ex-
perience of maDv people and governments, a
merry heart and a big sense of humor, and
the sooner he gets into the Victorian Par-
liament the better for that very disappoint-
ing institution.
The fool-farmers of Victoria have decided
to disband the Rural Producers’ Ass. in
order to “defeat the attempt of the
A.W.U. to cite it in the Arbitration Court.”
The funds are to be vested in trustees, and
future fees are to take the form of dona-
tions, to be used in defending producers’
interests. The Arbitration Court will doubt-
less take note of this little dodge and will
make any award apply to producers gener-
ally, so the sole result will be that the
farmer will rob himself of the chance of
putting his case before the Court effectively.
THE WEIGHT OF WATT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Willie Watt always loses weight at election times,
lie says, and he was already a stone lighter for his
latest efforts. One meeting at Essendon had served
to get away with two or three pounds.
Our Willie Watt is gaunt and thin ;
The jaw is slack that once was grim.
The weary work of getting in
Grows harder every time for him.
But paradoxical is fate—
He’s gaining Fat while losing weight.
The flesh is weak and it may fall,
But he defies the Labor groans,
Ilis back against the Tory wall —
A legislative bag of bones.
Wherefore the democratic lot
Can see through Mr. Willie Watt.
And, not content with losing mere
Material, he barters too
The spirit which from year to year
Has served to pull our Willie through,
And voters save, for his inspection,
The skin lie sloughs at each election.

ECZEMA ON THE FACE.
DRIVEN AWAY BY DR. MORSE’S
INDIAN ROOT PILLS, SAYS NOWRA
LADY.
“I have found Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills an excellent remedy for the blood,”
writes Mrs. Jane Kelly, of Bridge Road.
Nowra, N.S.W. “Some years ago I suffered
considerably with eczema on the face, and
found nothing to drive this malignant com-
plaint away but Indian Root Pills. They
cleanse the blood beyond all doubt and keep
the liver up to the mark, and move the
bowels in a mild manner. They are our
family medicine, and I recommend them to
my friends and acquaintances as an invalu-
able remedy. You can use this testimony.”
This torturing and disfiguring disease has
its cause in an impure condition of the
blood, which often arises from a diseased
condition of the stomach and allied organs
of digestion and nutrition. When digestion
is imperfect the nutrition of the body is
inadequate to its needs. The blood becomes
thin, poisons accumulate in it, and these
poisons often manifest themselves in some
eruptive disease. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills correct diseases of the stomach and
other organs of digestion and nutrition. They
eliminate poisonous substances from the
blood, purifying it and increasing its quality
and richness. They get at the cause and
foundation, and correct diseases of the
blood and other diseases which originate in
a disordered stomach.*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
The joyful news that Sydney is at last to
have a real scientific track suitable for motor and motor-
bike racing and also for aviation is another indica-
tion that the Ma State’s capital doesn’t intend to be
wholly left behind and trodden on in the rush of
progress. At present there is no track in or around
the city on which motor-cars can race, and even
motor-bike contests are highly dangerous. The man
who opens out takes his life in both hands, and
there have been some narrow escapes in the past—
so many, in fact, that the motor cyclists have defi-
nitely given up the idea of racing in Sydney, while
the owners of motor-cars have never even considered
it. The new track is to be called “the' Sydney
Brooklands” —which is another example of the silly
habit of stealing an English name and tying a rag
to its tail to prevent confusion. It will be situated
some nine miles from the G.P.O. It is served by
two lines of railway, and is likely to be also made
available by a tram service which will land people
at the gates. The ground itself is a natural amphi-
theatre, and the ideal shape for a motor track. By
a slight manipulation of the natural features of the
ground anil the provision of a few “hairpin” corners
so beloved bj- motorists, it can be made nearly five
miles long. The whole track will be in full view
of the spectators and sufficiently close to enable the
numbers of the cars to be seen quite distinctly. When
completed it will be the largest track in the world,
nearly twice the size of the English Brooklands, and
capable of carrying 10 cars abreast at full speed,
with plenty of room between. It is a fine bold
scheme, and the promoting spirit is Mr. A Smith, of
Double Bay, a son of the well-known old-time Sydney
sportsman, Mr. Geo. Smith, owner of Bessie Bedlam,
and who was identified with the aboriginal cricket
team which visited England in 1869. The thing was
bound to come, and it is a pleasing circumstance
that it is going to be brought by a Sydney native, and
not an all-fired Yankee.
Henry Hawker, the Australian aviator
who nearly flew round Britain, arrived in Melbourne
last Saturday, and proved to be anything but the
fair maiden’s idea of a hero. And yet he certainly
is one. Just consider the things he has done. He
holds the English duration record of Bhr, 23min.
Alone he soared 11,450 ft. (record) ; with one pas-
senger he flew 12,900 ft. (record) upwards; and, later
on, with two passengers, reeled 10,600 ft. towards the
stars (record again). Then he took three passengers
8400 ft. into the upper air, and brought them back
again (record some more). In addition, he holds
the world’s hydro-aeroplane flight record, and estab-
lished yet another premiership when he bounded sky-
ward 1200 ft. in one minute. He is coming to Syd-
ney shortly, per biplane, and reckons to cover the
550 miles in five hours. After that he will show us
how to loop the loon-. He will probably meet his end
by falling down a front doorstep.
Roger de Paginat has dug out some inter-
esting figures regarding aviation. Just consider this
little list:—

The first aeroplane flight of any import-
ance to take place in Maoriland is booked shortly at
Auckland.. Ex-farmer Hammond has agreed to give
an exhibition on the Defence Department’s mono-
plane, Britannia. As Bill Massey and eo. don’t
know what to do 4 with this white elephant of the
skies, they’re lending it to Hammond in the hope,
perhaps, that he’ll break it. Later on, Hammond
contemplates flying- from Wellington to Christchurch.
With luck the journey, he says, will call for about
two hours. Without luck it will probably call for
a hearse. But that’s not being considered" just yet.
Still it might be worth while for undertakers at each
end of the route to put in tenders for the ex-farmer’s
burial.
Assisted by a gay nor’-easter, Sydney Fly-
ing Squadron blew merrily through two heats and a
final. The whole squadron was out, and half the
Harbor seemed to be floored over with boats. The
excitement in the first heat was the disqualification
of Mona, which crossed the starting line too soon, and
was promptly biffed out. On the other hand, Blanche
and Quibree crossed it too late, and thereby biffed
themselves out. The winner turned up in Livonia,
with Arline and Swastika second and third. In the
second heat, Lilian nearly capsized, but good sea-
manship and bad language kept the craft afloat and
enabled the skipper to secure second place, with Gold-
ing just in front, 23sec. away. But for the snapping
of a spar Lilian would probably have landed the
bacon. In the final, Golding and Acme fought a
duel. Golding was decisively defeated, and Acme
rushed on, to be challenged later by Kismet. But
even fate itself could not stop the triumphant rush of
Acme, and that craft won easily, with Kismet second
and Lilian third. Golding and Livonia were fourth
and fifth respectively.

The chief event at the annual Manly
Regatta on Saturday last was the All Yachts Race,
and the chief feature of the struggle was the general
all-round rumpus. Eight yachts competed, and as
the handicaps were given at the beginning of the
contest the spectators knew exactly how the struggle
was going. Petrel romped over the winning line
with a huge lead on Rawhiti and Culwulla 111. But
Oulwulla flew the protest flag, and was understood to
have lodged objections to both the leaders. Aoma
was fourth, and also helped to put a joyous froth on
the beer of life by hoisting a flag of protest. Manly
regattas are often lively, but this was the most
stormy held for a long time. The people who patron-
ised the flagship complained they could see nothing,
and that they were not informed of the results. The
competitors complained on general principles, and it
was a day of general heartburning.
The N.S.W. swimming team sent to Bris-
bane for the championships on the 24th and 25th
is a particularly strong one. First is the mighty
Longworth himself, and with him his great opponent
of a fortnight ago, Cecil Healy. The third man is
the redoubtable A. W. Barry, who recently won the
100yds. State Championship, and the fourth E. C.
Fox, the 220yds. Breast Stroke State Champion. It
is a crowd that will take some beating, and there
will be an awful splash before it is walloped.

Alick Wickham, the well-known Sydney
swimmer, turned professional a few weeks ago, and
on Saturday last made his first great splash at the
Waverley League Club’s third annual carnival. The
event was the 100 Yards State Championship, and, as
the event had to be decided in the Bronte bath,
which is just a trifle larger than the ordinary board-
ing-house washing apartment, it had to be split into
three heats and a final. J. Pryer, of North Sydney,
won tne first in lmin. -slsec., with two yards to
spare; S. Kauffman, of Randwick and Coogee, the
second by a yard in lmin. 9sec. ; and Wickham the
third in lmin. 3 l-ssec., with five yards between him
and the second man. In the final Wickham spread-
eagled his field, and won from Pryer by four yards, in
lmin. 0 4-ssec. Which was mighty fast travelling.
The Summer Baseball Competition at
Sydney saw one startling boil-over on Saturday. The
unlucky club is Petersham, which, although it had
worked hard and played well, always found the
fortune of war against it. This week it was up
against Waverley Red Sox, which came, like a lion
full of freshly eaten Daniels, to do the devouring
act. and started the game with two to nil. Then
Petersham startled itself and the onlookers by scor-
ing two each in two sessions while Red Sox froze.
Back again Petersham failed to score, and Red Sox
with perfect assurance put on two. Hereabouts
came the shock of the afternoon and a spellbound
audience saw Petersham make NINE. The flabber-
gasted Red Sox responded with three, but the soul
had oozed out of them, and the team was finally
overthrown by 13 to eight. It was Waverley’s evil
day, for when the Blue Sox went up against
Leichhardt the latter blew it out by seven to six,
which, though close, was quite decisive enough.
The double disaster threw quite a gloom over the
suburb where the burials are.
The Maoriland strike having simmered
out or blown off, the N.S.W. Bowling team will, it is
definitely stated, start for the Isles at the end of this
week. Of course, we have heard that yarn before,
but this time it does look, at the hour of writing, as
though the blessed team will really go. If it does,
its troubles will commence at Auckland on January
26, and end at Wellington on February 20.

Metropolitan versus Country was the
chief item on the Tennis menu last week at Sydney.
The City overthrew the Gumleaves brigade by 15
rubbers to six—nine to three in the doubles and six
to three in the singles.
Maoriland Lawn Tennis Championships,
lately decided at Auckland, slew all the alleged cham-
pions. Every player of note was wiped out in the
early rounds, and the final was fought out by A. J.
Wallace and C. J. Dickie, from the same little, back-
blocks club in the cow-spanking interior of Taran-
aki. Wallace downed his mate; then they com-
bined and walked right through the doubles, eating
up all the cracks and finishing off Abbott and
McCutcheon in the final.
. Clarence and Lindsay Todd had a joyful
time at the Country Tennis Tournament at Sydney
last week. They gathered the Singles and Doubles
championships, and their team (that of Trundle)
pocketed the country teams championship. The
splendid quality of their play is evidenced by the
fact that during the whole tournament they were
defeated only once, and then in the last set of a long
series of exhausting games.
Three sons of Belial in the form of police-
men put up a special and particularly horrible per-
formance at Bulli (N.S.W.) on Sunday last. A
“two-up” chapel was conducting service, and was
surprised, surrounded and lumbered. Not one of
the whole congregation, some 30. escaped. Why
so much trouble should be taken over “two-uppers”
when so many scoundrels are allowed to run loose
is one of the mysteries of our crack-brained civilisa-
tion, but if there is any leather-medal in existence
for police dexterity these three John Hoppers should
certainly get it.
“J.P.”: If you ask the Yankee Track
Team what’s. the hottest athletic proposition it has
encountered in Maoriland, it will answer promptly:
“Mister Handicap!” The Yanks were absolutely stag-
gered when they stepped lightly off the steamer and
found that they had to run against handicap, such a
thing being quite unknown in the Jewnited States.
Everyone runs off the mark over there, the result
being that the nresent consignment of tourists are all
at sea in handicap events, and try to make up the
leeway too quickly. The whole system, in fact, is
strange to them, and they haven’t struck the correct
method of dealing with it yet.
In the match against South Australia the
Maoriland XI built up 362 without the aid of a
single century, the top score being the 96 of Reese.
Sneddon made 88, Sandman hit 56, Ilemus 46 and
good old Sundries put up the phenomenal score of
26—which was very remarkable for the Adelaide
team. When S.A. got to the sticks it also refrained
from century making, but it recorded 433. Pellew
narrowly escaped the century with 94, and so did
Hill with 92. Steele biffed 73, Wilsmore 57, and
Crawford carried his bat for 48. After that, Maori-
land went back to the old place of business, and lost
two wickets for 23. The bowling averages on either
side were deplorable. With 287 for six wickets,
M.L. closed and tried to rush S.A. through, but
failed, taking three wickets only for 161 runs.
Result a draw.
The eighth round of Sydney First-Grade
Cricket commenced on Saturday last, and was re-
markable only for the superiority of the ball over
the bat under circumstances that favored the imple-
ment of war generallv known as “the willow.” As
the Telegraph remarked, it was “a day made to
order.” But the order did not rise to the occasion.
Not one single century graced the afternoon, and
the highest score amidst perfect surroundings was the
98 of Macartney for Gordon against North Sydney.
11. Davis, of Waverley, filled second place of honor
on the batting list with 92, and J. S. Taylor, of
Western Suburbs, extolled himself by making 83
(no.). There were other creditable scores, but they
were too numerous to mention. Nevertheless it was
the ball’s day out. Petersham made a mighty bad
beginning against Western Suburbs, being dismissed
for 192 and slogged for 138 for the loss of four
Western wickets. Petersham’s agony was due to
the bowling of Owen, who took four for 55, and the
three of Dupain cost 44. Glebe rushed up 141 against
Redfern, and that Syrian suburb replied with 109
for the loss of seven wickets. Glebe would have done
better but for bowler Grummett, who flattened five
wickets for 31, to say nothing of Goddard, who got
three for 25. On behalf of Glebe, Cotter replied
with four for 48. Waverley bashed 271 off the
Sydney bowling, the best of which was that of Rowe,
who got five sticks for 36. When Sydney got to the
wickets it made 10 for the loss of one wicket. Thanks
to Macartney’s 98, Gordon hit up 231, in spite of
the bowling of North Sydney, for whom Hopkins took
three wickets for 20 and Minnett four for 77. When
North Sydney got to the sticks. Macartney again got
busy, and took four wickets for four runs, leaving
North’s score 17 for four. Balmain battered the
University bowling doggedly, and by energy, civility,
punctuality, early rising and strict attention to busi-
ness, hoisted 242 on the board. Stack smashed five
of the wickets for 80 runs, and Barbour three for 12.
By sunset, University had accumulated 25 without
the loss of a wicket. At Manly by the sea, Middle
Harbor fell upon the bowling of the invading Central
Cumberland, and smote it for 127. Coogan, of
C.C., got six wickets for 53, and Best four for 26.
After which, Central Cumberland fled into the tall
timber and was put through for 115, Randell taking-
five sticks for 47, and Rough three for 53. This
was rough indeed.

The sixth round of Vic. Pennant Cricket,
concluded on Saturday, was sufficiently long-drawn-
out to suit the most enthusiastic stonewaller, the
commencement thereof having happened back on
December 20 of last year. And as most of the
games were foregone conclusions they evoked little
interest. North, having erected the steep tally of
379 for two wickets (Carlton 122 and H, Stuckey
117 n. 0.), closed; arid told P’ran to bog in. It dis-
covered that the said bogging in was superior to its
own bowling, and could only get the shopkeepers out
once for 295—a two-point victory. ’Varsity, gather-
ing in a feeble tally of 137, had its head knocked
against the wall by the Saints, who scored 297 for
seven wickets, then closed, and sent the Students in
again. The latter managed to save their faces, but
not the two-point licking. Northcote found its ridi-
culous first-innings score of 103 answered by 218 from
South. Going in again, it fared almost as badly,
scoring but 141. whereupon South rattled up 27 for
the loss of a wicket, and so won outright. ’Roy had
put up 202 to Essendon’s 83, and essayed to rush it
through again, but failed dismally, the ’Dons making
253 for nine wickets at the second attempt. Carl-
ton’s 136 was no good against East’s 212, though
sufficient to stall off the straight-out defeat. ’Wood
had the usual practice match with M.C.0., and had
the satisfaction of beating it on the first innings by
185 to 143, though neither score was anything to
brag about.

The inability of South Australia to rake
up a representative team to cross the Bight has smit-
ten Westralian cricket heavily. Somehow the East-
erners to a man dislike the Bight, and, also, more’s
the pity, there seems to be a desire not to give Wes-
tralian cricket a lift. Recently an effort was made
to give the State a seat on the Board of Control with
a share of all the financial joys and sorrows attached
thereunto. But while the seat was conceded, the
trimmings were carefully shorn off. It was like ask-
ing a man to dinner and refusing him a drink.
Queensland cricketer 11. Ironmonger reaps
a just and righteous reward for his splendid efforts in
inter-State cricket this season, in the shape of a posi-
tion under the wing of the Melbourne Cricket Club.
Ironmonger is a left-handed trundler of promise, and
his new engagement should bring him the opportunity
to distinguisn himself in the best company. This
scribe is loth to take on the r6le of prophet, but all
the same he ventures to wager a drink that in the
fulness of time Ironmonger will be one of the orna-
ments of the Australian XI.
Sydney jockey B. Cain is an unlucky
wight. A fortnight ago his mount at Canterbury
Park (N.S.W.) capsized, and on Saturday last an-
other brute turned turtle in the Juvenile Handicap
Warwick Farm. On second thoughts Cain is a
mighty lucky wight. In the last spill he was one of
a field of 23, and not one of the 22 trod on him.
Jeff Smith is now in Australia, and, to-
gether with A 1 Lippe, Nat Williams and Jules Du-
bourg, were welcomed to Sydney by the usual dinner
at Hill’s Cafe. Jeff Smith is reminiscent of Clabby,
and at the same time has a suggestion of McGoorty
about him, and should prove a very hefty fighter.
His first match is with Dave Smith, and the prospect
does not seem to charm him overmuch. Smith, by
the way, is said to have recovered from his dog-
walloping and to be eager for the fray. But this
writer has grave doubts whether Smith will ever
fight as well again as he did before his last battle.
At the Melbourne Stadium Boyo Driscoll,
who had such a bad time owing to having swallowed
some false teeth, met Charlie Simpson, of Victoria.
The Briton had the advantage of a pound in the
weight, and piled up points very gaily for a time.
Then he began to wilt. Simpson came with a fine
rush, and during the last two rounds seemed to have
Driscoll done to a turn. But the visitor managed to
evade the knock-out, and saw the full term, and
having the balance of points in his favor, was
awarded the verdict.

The much-talked-of battle between the
English Jew, Matt Wells, and Herbert McCoy, the
Australian, drew a crowded house to the Stadium on
Saturday night. The huge place seemed fairly
packed. At the midday weighing, Wells proved to
be four ounces over the requisite 9st. 101 b., and that
extra quarter pound, according to the articles, was
to cost him £2OO in the shape of forfeit. It would
almost have paid him to have the amount cut off.
Like most new arrivals from the Cold Country, Wells
makes weight very rapidly here, and finds it easier
to put on than to take off. He had worked strenu-
ously to get it off, and failed, and the prospect of
parting with £2OO broke his heart. It was an awful
example of the high price of meat. For a time it
looked as though there would be no fight, except
with the mouth. Then the Stadium took a hand,
and intimated firmly that it had some forfeits to
collect in the event of the fight going up the spout—-
£5OO from Wells and £lOO from McCoy. This
brutal remark brought both battlers to their senses,
and the disputed £2OO stayed in the hands of the
Stadium authorities till such times as the principals
could agree to its destination or refer the settlement
to the courts.
In the ring Wells looked easily a stone heavier
than the pallid McCoy. It was obvious that he
would never again fight as a lightweight. Matt Wells
has passed into the welter ranks. So much heavier
and bigger did he look that, at the announcement of
the weights, the rude section of the crowd called the
announcer “Liar!” Wells opened the dance with
quite a different style of fighting from any he-has
exhibited before. He went right in to kill, and com-
menced proceedings with a very dainty exposition of
the McGoorty left hook. He was doing quite nicely
with it when McCoy landed a right on his left eye,
which staggered the Jew, and made him totter all
over Palestine. It was a beauty. But in the second,
Wells returned it in the form of a wallop to the
side of the head that made McCoy’s teeth rattle.
Wells had evidently sacrificed speed for the sake of
heavy hUting, and some of his rights were deadly.
He had the longer reach and he had the weight, and
he made skilful use of both. McCoy had a more or
less shocking time for about TO, rounds. Twice he
was all but outed, and was saved from the final
stroke by the gong. And then, quite suddenly, Wells,
who had exhausted himself trying to make the
weight, went to fragments. He cracked up, his head
began to smoke, and steam rose from his body as he
lumbered round the ring. McCoy was so hard pressed
in the earlier part of the fight that he resorted to all
his bad old tricks —tricks that, with a sterner ref-
eree, will one day get him disqualified. Wells, bit-
terly resenting these tactics, showed a few of his own,
but immediately a partisan house rose to its
feet and went quite mad. Both were warned,
but McCoy seemed to this scribe to be the
greater offender. The break-up of Wells produced
terror in the McCoy camp, which to a man regarded
the obvious distress of the brilliant Semite as mere sub-
terfuge—a trick to lure McCoy into leaving an opening
for a knock-out. But it was soon noticeable that when
Wells did land there was no sting in his blows, which
had also become strangely slow. And yet, exhausted
and smoking as he was, McCoy could not reallv
damage him. There was no possibility of a knock-
out. When the end came, the chivalrous Wells anti-
cipated referee Scott by putting his own hand on
McCov’s head. The Australian had won, and demon-
strated by his manner of doing it that he is not in
the same grade as Wells as a fighter. The man of
Judah was quite exhausted but never in danger of
being knocked out, while McCoy was twice on the
ver T verge of it. The versatility of Wells was re-
markable, and the first welter-weight he crashes into
when well and strong is due for a very rough time.
Wells has developed an unexpected punch, and his new
style of fighting is vastly more satisfying to the ring-
sider than that which he showed on his arrival in
this country.
About a famous N. S. Wales family:—*
Nigel Cox, son of Dr. Arthur Cox, of Sydney,
passed into Osborne Naval College last month, en
route to the British or, it may be, the Australian
Navy. His great-great-grandfather was a sailor —
Lieutenant William Cox —and a notable Australian
pioneer. William begat Edward Cox, of Fernhill,
near Penrith, and he had issue old Dr. James Cox,
who died only the other day. The first member of
this family to attain to any historical prominence
was Robert Cox, tutor to Charles 11. He labored
conscientiously with the Merry Monarch, but the odds
were against him. Charles’s two most salient charac-
teristics —an incorrigible penchant for the frailer sex
and a domainiacal hatred of washing—evidenced them-
selves at an early age and drove Cox to despair, and
ultimately to the chucking of his billet. Bereft of
Robert Cox’s guiding hand Charles grew worse than
ever, with the lamentable result that is to be found
in the histories of several of England’s ducal and
other families. A chronicler of the period relates
that after Cox withdrew from the Royal household,
Charles was so peeved that he vowed never to bath
again, and adhered with splendid courage to his
pledge for some seven or eight years, when a doctor
or a sanitary inspector or some such busy-body
stepped in and insisted on the kingly troth being
fractured.
A wealthy Unionist member of Britain’s
House of Commons was lately sued for the
recovery of £l5OO due to his former tutor,
whom he had engaged at a salary of £OOO to
exercise a wise restraint on his natural fool-
ishness. The M.P.’s defence (which failed
utterly) was that he had been unduly influ-
enced in the matter, therefore his counsel had
to try to make it clear that the Unionist mem-
ber for High Peak was incapable of taking
care of himself. His wife said she “thinks”
he is now able to look after his own affairs.
And of such is the Propputy Defence party
in the House of Corns.
“Billy Blue”: The Sydney City Council
threatens to apply the day-labor principle
to its legal branch, and some stir has been
caused thereby. The first city solicitor, ap-
pointed away back in March. 1843, was
George Robert Nichols. He held on to the
office till his death in September, 1857, and
was succeeded by Richard Driver, who had
been articled to him. Driver did the work
till his death on July 7, 1880, and the follow-
ing month his former articled clerk, George
Merriman, got the job and continued in it
till October 12, 1893, when he went out
under somewhat gloomy, circumstances.
George Charles Waldron was then ap-
pointed ; and on his death his partner, the
present City Solicitor, Percy S. Dawson,
was elected to the vacancy after a stiff battle.
The Council has always paid the profession
by the piece and not by the day or week or
month, and the threatened change is regarded
with an unfriendly eye.
“Mallee Hen”: A Victorian politician
whose wakefulness has passed into a proverb
was recently up in the Mallee doing a little
electioneering. He had spoken over-night,
and having some hours to wait for the train
to Melbourne in the morning, turned into
the barber’s for a shave. The shave fin-
ished, the energetic politician didn’t move,
and then the tradesman discovered that his
victim was fast asleep. It is not every day
that a Mallee barber has a distinguished poli-
tician asleep in his chair, and he proceeded
to make the most of it. On tiptoe, half the
population was brought in to see innocence
asleep in the chair with its mouth very
wide open.
“The Religious Editor”: I saw a mild-
faced, red-whiskered man in a tram the
other day, and the thought struck me that
he belonged to a dying race. When I was
a small boy there were lots of these gentle
red men about. There were some amongst
my own relations, and they often patted me
on the head and predicted that I would be
a great man some day. It wasn’t their fault
that I made liars of them. They had the
reputation of being good husbands and
fathers, and they generally came on Sunday
in black clothes, and were very regular at
church. At home they always sat on horse-
hair chairs in front of fires and twiddled
their thumbs, meanwhile giving off encourag-
ing remarks like “Well, well! Is that so?”
They suffered from a lack of ideas and never
made much money; but they had a pleasant
flow of gossip, never forgot or lost interest
in old friends, and attended funerals in a
pleasant spirit. I think their fireside and
funeral manners were their most remarkable
points. Of course, they didn’t really belong
to this sunlit country ; they imported them-
selves in “the early days,” and, being red,
pious fire-lovers, they wondered exceedingly
(in a placid sort of way) at the black-
haired Australian sun-worshippers they
fathered.

“I am pleased to report I am getting on splen-
didly, and am teeling better in every way, since I
started your Course.”—O.H., Dunedin, N.Z.
‘‘l have now finished my second month’s course, and
can say that I never felt better. Nothing pleases
me more than going through your exercises. My
chest is 36 inches, as against 33J when I started, and
I have put on 81b. in weight.”
E.M., Gunnedah, N.S.W.
“I must say I have improved wonderfully in health
and spirits since starting your Course. I have
gained nearly half a stone in weight, and I feel
better than ever.” —rT.J.11., Tolga, Q.
And only fifteen minutes’ daily exercise
secured these magnificent results. Isn’t it
convincing evidence of the great merit of my
instruction —of the wonderful benefits you

ADVICE.
“ Wavy ” Shampoos.
“Homely Hints.”
Few people know that stallax o'.n be used as a
shampoo and is far better than anything- else for
the purpose. It seems to have a natural affinity for
the hair, leaving it very glossy, fluffy and with a
pronounced natural “wave.” A teaspoonful of
stallax granules, dissolved in a cup of hot water,
is more than sufficient. Genuine stallax comes to
the chemist only in sealed tins, a quantity sufficient
to make up twenty-five or thirty separate shampoos.
The indescribable lustre it imparts to the hair is
quite inimitable. ** * For an actual hair grower
nothing equals pure boranium. It is quite harmless,
and sets the hair roots tingling with new life.
* * * The use of rouge is almost always obvious, but
powdered colliandum gives a perfectly natural color
and defies detection.
Oxygen to Remove
Bad Complexions.
“Useful Hints.”
Oxygen has the peculiar faculty of destroying waste
matter in the body without affecting healthy tissues
m the slightest degree. Sallow, blotchy and lifeless
complexions are caused by the accumulation of waste
matter which adheres stubbornly to the surface of
the skin. The most practical way to apply oxygen
to this waste matter is to use mercolized wax, such
as may be obtained at the chemist shops. It should
be rubbed well into the skin for several nights and
washed off in the mornings, like cold cream. In
contact with the skin, it releases oxygen, and thus
clears the skin of the disfiguring waste matter. It
is perfectly harmless, pleasant to use and indeed
very beneficial as a skin food. * * * To bring a nat-
ural red color to the lips, rub them with a soft
stick of prolaetum. * * * p'or tired, hot and perspir-
ing feet use a teaspoonful of powdered onalite in a
foot bath.
Effectually Killing
Superfluous Hair.
“Health and Beauty.”
Many women know how to remove ugly growths of
superfluous hair temporarily, but few know how to
remove it permanently. For this purpose pure pow-
dered pheminol may be used. Get about an ounce
from your chemist and apply a little directly to the
objectionable hair. The purpose of the recommended
treatment is not merely to remove the superfluous
hair instantly, but also to kill the hair roots com-
pletely in a comparatively short time. * * * Women
who are annoyed by body or perspiration odors will
appreciate the hint that a light dusting with pow-
dered (white) pergol occasionally is an instantane-
ous corrective. ** * For oilv complexion smart
women are now using the natural allacite of
orange blossoms as a greaseless cream. It holds
powder perfectly, gives the face a cool, fresh ap-
pearance which lasts, and it does not encourage
growth of hair on the face.
Home=Made Beauty.
“Cosy-Corner Chats.”
The very simplest things are often the most effec-
tive in making a woman beautiful. For instance,
ifew people know that a dull or greasy complexion
■can be instantly brought to a pretty, youthful,
natural bloom merely by the application of ordinary
■cleminite dissolved in water. Moreover, the method
cannot be detected even under the closest scrutiny.
The result will last all day long and requires no
powdering even under the most trying conditions
Indoors or out. If you have no cieminite in the
house get about an ounce from the chemist’s and add
only enough water to dissolve it. Apply a little to
the face. It is good for the skin and ‘ immediately
produces that cool, velvety, natural “bloom” so
much desired. * * * To make the eyelashes grow long,
dark and curly, apply a little mennaline with the
finger tips occasionally. It is absolutely harmless
and beautifies the eyebrows as well. * * * Pilenta
soap is the most satisfactory for all complexions. It
even works well in cold or hard water.

The Holman Government Reforms—
After a Fashion.
Dear Bulletin, —Even tlie Holman Gov-
ernment of N. S. Wales lias moments of
what may be vaguely defined as thingum-
bob, for lack of a better word; that is to
say, it has moments when its finances could
hardly be worse, but are so presented that
if you don’t look at them they look a shade
better. For instance, during the last half-
year Holman and Co. enjoyed the magnifi-
cent revenue of £8,300,884, and spent no less
than £8,9(55,09 <, so the apparent and obvi-
ous deficit was £664,213, or at the rate of
more than £1,300,000 per annum. This,
when added to the previous shortage, is
awful enough in all conscience. Again, it
appears that the revenue was £825,555 more
than that for the corresponding half of the
previous year, so the income is expanding
at the rate of over £1,650,000 a year. The
tact that even that very handsome increase
hasn t the least effect in keeping the present
gtiiig of public lunatics out of insolvency is
likewise awful enough. But there is at least
one redeeming feature of a sort. The short-
en U ', e sec ? nd half of 1912 was
2 ’ a ! ld as that for the second half
or lJlo, as shown above, was only £604,213,
so it seems on the surface of things that
though the Holman combine is still the
worst profligate the State has ever possessed
yet it isnt quite so bad as it used to be.
lo put the matter another way, it might
seem that, by comparison with itself, it was
becoming almost sane, though by comparison
with anybody else it is still as mad as a
hatter. And then the details begin to
obtrude themselves. It appears that £247 149
was saved by reducing the contribution paid
into the 1 üblic Works l\ind out of revenue
~~Y lat is to say, by charging so much more
ot the \\ orks expenditure to loans, or using
so much more loan money as revenue, and
hacking another large slab off the pretence
that the State’s land revenue is set aside for
Works purposes. And £211.890 was saved
by stopping altogether the paltry contribu-
r ol li. WIIC ! ~u ,sed to be made in redemption
or the public debt —a curiously mistimed
proceeding, when it is remembered that the
debt is growing faster than it ever did
before, and that the present Government is
pledged more definitely to a policy of economv
and debt redemption than any of its prede-
cessors. The result is that the half-year’s
deficit for July-December, 1913, is really
roo on a ! the growth of the receipts, some
£30,000 larger than the gap in the accounts
for July-December, 1912; but the fact is cov-
ered up in a fashion by an enthusiastic juggle
With the ever-useful loan. It is no marvel
that the Holman combination “chucked”
the empty formality of telling the country in
the early part of the financial year how it
pioposed to dodge the spectre of insolvency,
and went to the electors “on the nod.” in a
manner of speaking. It is a great deal too
late now to put the accounts straight this
year, even if the Government had the faint-
est idea how to perform that feat; but by
judicious reticence and the wonderful agility
shown at the second ballot, the really great
evil the loss of the jobs and the salaries—
has been averted. And now there are three
etc r H if* 106 ahead ~ bar accidents.—Yours,

you
really enjoy life ?
The bright days of Summer should be days of physical
enjoyment and mental rest—rest from worry, rest from
indisposition.
Your work should be undertaken with cheerful
serenity, and if you are to “make good” it should be now.
_ Consider how little there is between a general indis-
position and real good health—nothing but a half-teaspoonful
of Kriischen Salts !
Kriischen Salts, taken regularly for a few mornings
make all the difference between the gloomy pessimist and
a healthy optimist.
Kriischen Salts is not a “fizzy drink.” It is not effer-
vescent at all and therefore has no tendency to produce
flatulence or discomfort after it is taken.
By stimulating your liver and kidneys to activity and
cleansing your system, Kriischen Salts help Nature to cast
off sluggishness. Hot weather ailments disappear, and you
are conscious of an exuberant vitality, a desire to be up
and doing.
Apart from the medicinal qualities of these salts, they
contain many valuable tonic properties—ask your doctor to
glance at the analysis (on every bottle) and tell you if it
is not so.

The crying need for prompt legislative
action to check the spread of syphilis could
have no more convincing proof than was
provided by a case heard a week ago in the
Christchurch (M.L.) Police Court. A mid-
dle-aged woman who has been plying the
oldest profession in the world for some years,
was charged with being an idle and dis-
orderly person, having insufficient lawful
visible means of support. Chief-Detective
Bishop explained that the woman was living
in- her own house in the city, and that she
used the premises for the purposes of Raiiab
of Jericho. She had purchased the place
two years ago for £5OO, and had paid off
£200; She also had money in the bank. The
reason for the prosecution was that she was
, suffering from syphilis., and the police were
“doing their best to prevent what was a
crime against the young men of the city.”
Evidence was given by detectives that the
house was frequently visited by men, and
that when they had spoken to the woman
as to her means of living she had openly
defied them. She said she had taken legal
advice, and had been assured that so long
as she lived alone, and had no other woman
in the house, she could gain her daily crust
as she liked. And unfortunately that is the
Maoriland law. .It was decided by the Court
of Appeal some years ago, in the case of
Cassidy v. Cassells, that the fact that a
woman living alone uses her residence as a
place of prostitution does not constitute that
house a brothel within the meaning and
snuffle of the Act, and the woman does- not
come within reach of the short arm of the
law. It is further laid down that if a
woman possesses property, in cash or kind,
no matter how she came by it, she cannot
be held to be without means. Counsel for
the accused called no evidence to controvert
the police statements as to his client’s
health, but proceeded to show that, accord-
ing to what passes for law in Maoriland,
her condition didn’t matter. The police, he
said, should use their influence to have the
, • u - re P laced on the Statute Book, from
whlch /t had been wiped., through sentiment
and the action of certain “well-meaning”
people—otherwise Wowsers. The magistrate
pertinently asked where the Department of
lublicHealth came in, and the reply of the
Chief-Detective was that it didn’t come in
anywhere. It stayed out. The District
Health Officer —who is, of course, a medical
man—had been applied to, and had explained
that he had no power to deal with such a
case. His department can insist on the noti-
hcation of every case of chicken-pox and of
all other more-or-less harmless infectious
and contagious disorders, but it has no
authority to notice the disease which is to
be the physical and mental ruin of hundreds
ot Maorilanders yet unborn. The matter
was of course, dismissed, but it was re-
gamed a s so grave that the leader-writers
of godly Christchurch were driven to rail
about the inability of the law to deal
with strange women” and “a certain re-
pulsive and highly contagious disease.” Thev
also published the defendant’s name and
address as a public warning. One of the
cauy papers,. indeed, actually mentioned the
words prostitute” and “syphilis” ; so there
is some hope for Maoriland, after all.
The Parson, the Policeman and the
Lady.
In London, the other day, a highly-pictur-
esque story of criminal assault resulted in
a verdict of £lOOO damages for the alleged
culprit one Rev. Thomas Ghent, formerly
of Victoria. A police sergeant named Fitz-
gerald had accused the shepherd of assault-
ing . Mrs. Fitzgerald in the same old way
during the progress of, a “jumble sale,’’
organised by his parishioners. The police-
man published his wife’s story to the world,
legardless of the fact that her veracity as
legards attacks on her respectability was
already under grave suspicion. She had
previously charged another parson with mis-
conduct, but his bishop, after holding an
mqmrv had decided that she was a neui-

HOW THE WOMEN OF VIENNA OBTAIN
THEIR PERFECT BUST DEVELOPMENT.
Or. Colonnay, of the Faculty of Medicine, Paris, dispels
many popular illusions and upsets all previous
theories regarding rapid development of the
bust. Why costly advertised methods fail.
How any woman may now develop her bust at least six inches in thirty days
without exercises, massage, prescriptions, apparatus, or any similar expen-
sive, inconvenient and harmful methods. The simple home method
used by the women of Vienna fully explained below for the benefit
of Sydney “Bulletin” Readers.
“No matter whether a woman be young or
old, nor what her condition of health may
be, I firmly believe that in this treatment
she has an infallible method for developing
and beautifying her bust.” Thus speaks no
less an authority than I)r. Colonnay, of the
Faculty of Medicine, Paris, regarding the
remarkable method of natural bust develop-
ment first
used in this
countrv b y
Mile. Ma r-
garette Mer-
lain, who,
until a short
time ago,
was so thin
and emaci-
ated as to ap-
p e a r almost
c a daverous.
Her cheeks
were horribly
sunken, her
neck, shoul-
de r s and
chest showed
scraggy out-
lines of the
bones, and
her bust was
a b s o lutely
flat and unde-
veloped. I n
startling con-
trast with
her former
self Mile. Merlain is now the proud pos-
sessor of faee and neck with full and softly
rounded contour, her bust has been devel-
oped six inches, until it is perfectly firm
and of exactly the right proportions, and
her entire form has the symmetry and youth-
ful grace of outline which excites the admira-
tion and envy of every woman with an angu-
lar, masculine figure. A bustless and
undeveloped woman always appears utterly
lacking in the most essential attribute of
feminine physical attractiveness, without
which distinguishing feature she appears to
be incomplete.
But at last there has been discovered a
means whereby any woman can quickly and
easily obtain a superb and beautiful bust.
m
» f
m
-
s
Best of all, every woman hag at hand, in
the strict privacy of her own home, facilities
for obtaining the same results which Mile.
Merlain and several of her friends have
found so simple and easy of accomplishment.
There are no prescriptions to have .filled, no
apparatus or appliance to buy, no time-
wasting exer-
cises, mas-
sage or simi-
lar worthless
a d v ertised
methods t o
use. In short,
Mile. M er-
lain has no-
thing what-
ever to sell
you, and all
you need do
is to send for
the book she
has just pub-
lished. B y
sending the
coupon be-
low, as evi-
dence that
you are a
reader of the
Sydney Bul-
letin/ y o u
can obtain
one of these
books abso-
lutely fr e e
of cost, for arrangements have just been
made to distribute 1000 regular copies as a
special advertising and introductory offer.
At present the books are not for sale, but
you can obtain one in exchange for the at-
tached coupon, with the understanding that
you will recommend the method to others
after you find it entirely satisfactory your-
self, and also write Mile. Merlain a confiden-
tial letter testifying to what the method has
done for you. Send no money for the book,
for it is entirely free, but if convenient two
penny stamps may be enclosed for postage.
There is no agreement to sign, and sending
for the book places you under no obligation
whatever.
Mile. Margarette Merlain (Suite 1024 F.),
Pembroke House, Oxford Street, London, W. (Eng.)
I send this coupon as evidence that I am entitled to receive
entirely free of cost or obligation, a regular copy of your
book, giving full particulars in regard to method by which
you developed your bust six inches in 30 days. After using
the method and finding it perfectly satisfactory, I agree to
recommend it to my friends, and send you a testimonial of
its effects, but my name is to be kept strictly confidential
and on no account to be used or mentioned to others.

The REXONOLA
The King of ail Talking Machines.
We introduce this splendid musical instru-
ment to the public with every confidence,
knowing that it is the finest sound-repro-
ducing instrument that has been made.
Handsome in appearance, solidly and faith-
fully built of carefully selected material, it is
beautifully finished, and will be an admired
addition to any home, no matter how well
furnished.
The Cabinet or concealed horn style is
undoubtedly the instrument of the future for
home entertainment. In appearance and
economy of space, and for convenience of
operation, it is far in advance of anything
hitherto offered.
The patented sound chamber of the
Rexonola is an entirely new design, and gives
a tonal result which is a revelation, and must
be heard to be appreciated. The tone is full
in volume, rich and clear, without noisiness,
and the quality is delightful.
The Flush Top, with removable motor
board, is a feature of the Rexonola which
is found in no other instrument. Those who
have had experience of other Cabinet instru-
ments, in which the operating parts are at
the bottom of a dark, dust-filled pit, will
appreciate this feature. They will find it a
pleasure to operate the Rexonola, in which
everything is so placed as to be clearly viewed and conveniently handled.
By a simple operation, all that is necessary being the turning of four screws, the
motor board, with motor attached, can be removed for the occasional oiling that is
necessary.
The Motor of the Rexonola is the finest quality Swiss, with perfected worm
gear governor system, ensuring steady and silent running. We. guarantee the
Rexonola motor, and will replace, free of charge, any part that is found to be
defective.
Until you have listened to Caruso or Melba singing through this
beautiful instrument in your own home, the wonderful charm of the
Rexonola is not really known to you. This delightful instrument will
soon be universally admitted as the first musical necessity in a modern
drawing-room.

“I suffered badly from indigestion and constipa-
tion,” writes Mrs. Alice A. Powell, Cressy, Tas.
“After trying several medicines without deriving
any benefit I got a bottle of Chamberlain’s Tablets,
and the result was wonderful. Even after the first
dose I felt better, and they have completely cured
me of my constipation.’’*
IN BANANA LAND
“The public debt of Queensland is increas-
ing out of all reasonable proportion to her
population. For the last financial year, while
population only increased 2.3 per cent., the
debt was advanced by 7.5 per cent.” — Out-
burst of candor from the Brisbane Courier.
_ Brisbane is. immensely proud of its strap-
ping fire brigade and its superb new
hydrant, capable of sending a jet half-way
lip the Public Debt —if there is the water to
do it with. But mostly there isn’t. At a
recent big fire the hydrant was therefore'
dropped, and the brigade operated with
buckets and watering-cans.
Bramble Cay, the sandy islet whereon
the Tasman went ashore lately, up near
Thursday Island, got its name from the one-
time revenue-cutter Bramble, which did
survey work .on the Australian coast, and
after being dismantled in ’53 was used for
very many years as a lightship at the Sow
and Pigs in Port Jackson. The islet pro-
duces a vegetable growth which Captain
Cook used to serve up to his sailors. It
was healthy but very unpalatable, and in
those ‘ good old days” the seaman who re-
fused the stuff received a dozen lashes. Then
if he still disliked it he received another
dozen.
The passing out of Joshua Peter Bell’s
widow recalls the fact that Queensland, in a
political sense, doesn’t quite rank with Baby-
lon or even with Venice for age, and Rome
beats it by a nose. Joshua kept the cash in
the States first Ministry (that of Robert
Ceorge Wyndham Herbert) and its second
\ x Mac r , a „ lister ’ s ) for about 19 months
(18(34-66). There was very little cash, but
he kept whatever 2d. there was. He looked
after Lands for a year (’66-’67) in the
fourth Ministry (Macalister’s). (The third
one which was Herbert again, only endured
17 days.) Finally he carried the bag for
nearjy three years (1871-74) in the seventh
Ministry (that of profane old Palmer) and
then he dronoed out of the portfolio-bearing
industry. He died suddenly in a hansom
cab, of all places, in December, 1881. The
deceased lady was formerly Margaret Miller
DOrsey, daughter of Dr. ‘ McTaggart
D Ursey. She married Joshua Peter in 1862.
So she had 19 years of married life, and 32
years of widowhood.
Digby Denham, who takes F. J. McDer-
mott, the Principal Under-Sec., with him
to the English pawnbrokery, first met the
official when Digby was Minister and McDer-
mott Under-Sec. for Agriculture. The yarn
is told that the Under-Sec. was one day
examining some agricultural photos with his
Minister. Lifting up the picture of a hand
lucerne-seed sower, the Under-Sec. for
Agriculture observed that it was “a curious-
looking camera.” They got on well enough
afterwards; but for a time Digby did
wonder what McDermott was doing in that
galley.
The outcry in Bananaland against the
restrictions placed on artesian boring has
led to a revision of the regulations, but the
Government has not been so foolish as to
allow itself to be turned off its course. It
is still necessary to apply for leave to sink
a bore, or to enlarge or alter one, though
it is given out that applications won’t be
hung up so long as they have been hitherto.
The chief restriction again relates to casings.
There are to be two of them, of the best
quality, and of specified weight, etc. Also
each bore must be provided with a cap and
stop-valve so that the flow can be controlled
and measured, this being necessary to cal-
culate the shrinkage, if any. Statistics,
(hough partly guess-work, indicate that the
flow is still decreasing. Last year’s tally in
N, S. Wales showed it to be per cent,
less than it was in the previous year.
THE SOFT ANSWER.
THE VISITOR: “Never mind, my poor fellow, there are sermons in stones, you know."
THE RESIDENT: “Maybe, gunner; but if you think we cracks stones all day sear chin'
fer sermons I merely has to remind you this ain't no hidyit asylum yiv got into."
The. old Poll-tax Ministry was fairly well
blessed with this world’s goods. Three of its
Ministers, Cribb, Dalrymple and John
Leahy, have passed out in the last three
years, leaving property valued for probate
at £70,000, £39,000 and £12,000 respectively.
The poorer members of that Cabinet are still
alfve. They can’t afford to die yet.
, One of the five Methodist parsons who
on January 14 celebrated the 50th anniver-
sary of their arrival in Port Jackson is
F. T. Brentnall, now and for 28 years an
M.L.C. of Queensland. He is 80 years of
age. In 1883 an affection of the throat
drove him out of the pulpit, so he bought
an interest in the Brisbane Telegraph,
joined the literary staff, and became chair-
man of the co. on the resignation of James
Cowlishaw in October, ISBS. Having got
well on his feet after quitting the ministry,
Brentnall repaid the denomination the
money it had spent on him in sending him
to Australia.
Cabled that Richard Wingfield Stuart,
pioneer, horse-breaker, company-promoter,
boxer, painter and a few* other things, one
of the last of Queensland’s early-day squat-
ters, has died in London, after a brave fight
with an extra-painful illness. He came to
Queensland when he was 19, in ’62. Amongst
his old cronies were Joshua Peter Bell,
Gordon Sandeman and W. E. Parry-Okeden
—about the three best-known old-timers on
the Downs and in the West. Dick Stuart’s
father was brother to the Earl of Castle-
stuart and his mother’s father was Viscount
Powerscourt; and despite the burden of his
pedigree he was one of the best-liked men
in the Western country. He started as a
jackeroo on Burrandowan under Parry-
Okeden (father of Queensland’s ex-Commis-
sioner of Police), and soon was Okeden’s
mate on a trip to the head of the Dawson —
a very wild part them—looking for new
country. Droving, horse-breaking and
brumby-running filled in the years till ’67,
when he and the Okedens bought Mount
Debateable. He became part-owner of Mit-
chell Downs a while afterwards. There
were a lot of evidences of “Dick’s” versati-
lity about the Mitchell Downs homestead,
lie adorned _ the walls of the dining-room
with horse-pictures, astonishingly well done
for a man who had never learned painting.
More to the purpose, the OMM herd at
Mitchell Downs was one of the finest in
the country. Having sold the place, Stuart
started out forming pastoral companies—
the Western Queensland Pastoral Co. and
the Queensland Co-operative Pastoral Co.
The latter, weighted down with big names
and capital, went into liquidation, and
Stuart went into mining. There, being
over-sanguine and easily taken down, he
fell in badly. He put in a while at selling
fish in W.A., but made a rise again, and was
visiting London about a Tasmanian tin pro-
position he had got hold of when he died.
His widow (he was married twice) is a
daughter of C. A. Lee, patriarch of the
N.S.W. Assembly. She and her two sons
are living at Tenterfield.
Bananaland is looking for a bottle on
which to celebrate the jubilee of its first
railway. Fifty years ago next month the
Arthur Griffith of the day turned the first
sod at Ipswich. Now the State has 4961
miles of track, and hasn’t paid for one of
them. Old Hansard reports show that the
House had a big fight on the question of
gauges—4ft. 81in. or the narrow 3ft. 6in.
Unfortunately for Queensland, and for Aus-
tralia, the streak received the verdict on
points. Commissioner Evans has raked the
scrapheap, and found some of the engines
that were on the rails in those earliest days,
and these he intends to exhibit alongside the
big ClB locomotives now turned out at
Ipswich. Incidentally, somebody deserves
an extra glass from the bottle for the en-
couragement that led Ipswich and Walker’s
(Maryborough) to go in for engine-building.
To-day they not only supply Queensland,
but cut in with the foreigner for southern
contracts.
The police of Cairns the other day walked
into a betting shop to see what the odds
were, and carted 34 gamblers off to gaol.
Of these 24 were Japanese, eight Chinese
and the other two Malays—all busy, of
course, doing .the “donkey-work” of the
continent. ; That’s the sort of foundation
for a White Australia that the Tommy
Tanna party of Queensland laid down. And
it is the foundation that our brilliant vis-
itor, soap-man Lever, wants to extend.
The Dividendaire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am tlie Dividendaire!
Blow with your trumpets and blare!
tiirt not in purple like monarchs of old,
Bearing no trappings of silver and gold.
Yet am 1 potent as one on the throne,
Pampered and proud as the dream of a drone,
Sucking the sap of a country afar,
Sweeping the street as a god in the car,
Mark me and hail me with ear-splitting
blare—
I am the Dividendaire!
1 am the Dividendaire!
Mine are the young and the fair!
•Mine are the nights of imperial riot,
Days that would mount into Heav’n and
defy it;
Mine are the helots that grovel in grime
Bred i’ the gutter and spawn o’ the slime;
Who shall put harriers athwart me and say
“Here is thy limit and this is thy stay!”
Who shall put bounds to the sea of my
pride—
“ Thus and thus far slialt thou be and abide?”
Who shall forbid me and ask if I dare,
Stripping my soul and her nakedness bare?
I am the Dividendaire!
I am the Dividendaire!
Women of loveliness rare,
Practised in witchery, potent in wile.
Wait on my whimsies and fawn for a smile.
Fill thou my halls with a fragrance divine
Hinting at gods, with their nectar and wine!
Why shouldst thou weep for the Virtue of
.old?
He is no niggard to whom thou wert sold !
Dost thou not slumber on thrice-driven down ?
Dost thou not sweep as a queen through the
town ?
Does not the envy of women who stare
Daily pursue thee, the favored and fair.
Pet o’ the Dividendaire?
I am the Dividendaire!
Trumpet my praise i’ the air !
I am the darling of Fate and the gifted :
I am the Calf that the Chosen have lifted;
I am the scourge that your freed has created,
Type of the lust that is ever unsated;
Curse me, ye people, and gibe if you will,
Do! in your bosoms ye worship me still;
Wherefore I smile at the grudge that ye bear.
Faugh at the hate that would raven and
tea r.
f am the Dividendaire!
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, 37. 3934
My Dear Thabgomindait,-
Forgive tlie infuriatingly-cramped type-
writing, but the place is literally creeping
with teachers, and the spectacle lias got on
my nerves. They (the teachers not the
nerves) have been having a conference, and
are unanimously in favor, it transpires of
increased screws all round, with bonuses’for
specially deserving cases—a circumstance
which proves touchingly that the dominie
is as human as any other. There is a camp
at Southport for the men, and another at
Cleveland for the women. The Macgregor
has borne his tartan and claymore, to both
thus obviating the demon jealousy. By the
way, the Cleveland ladies’ camp js in reality
only partially so. Two battalions and an
army corps of lady teachers have sought the
shelter and ease and comfort which a couple
of the best pubs afford. Meanwhile away
out in the wild, amid the ravening mos-
quitoes, sand-flies and the like, Miss Henry
and Miss Jessie Lang are teaching the
learned ones to swim, dance, skip and life
save. They know everything else. Minister
Jimmy Blair spent half a day on Wednes-
day watching them skip. He would have
watched them swim also, but they felt he
was a little young for such a spectacle.
Still Jas. bore no petty malice, and lo
prove it he went along with his ornamental
wife and shook the hands of 17 tons of
homing teachers on the gangway of that
fine old marine ruin, the Lucinda. Mrs.
.Timmy wore pink, with a coatee of some
filmy floral stuff. Quantities of speeches
were made, but no serious inconvenience
was occasioned, as a powerful band had
been provided, and it duly drowned the
orators’ remarks.
The Tom O’Sullivans departed by mail
train on Monday morning to join the Orvieto
in Sydney. _ He had the usual farewell meal
handed to him by his department, also a pair
of spy glasses for use on his travels. The
man Blair, abovementioned, will attend to
Lis job in his absence.
Mr. and Mrs. William Thorne are off lo
Europe next month. She specialises in
works of charity—in fact, to her the doing
of good comes as easy as drinking or back-
biting does to others.
On Tuesday morning, Mrs. J. Forsyth fed
Ihe committee of the Lady Lamington Hos-
pital at the Cafe Eschenhagen. The com-
mittee looked as if it had been recently
boiled —a popular weather-effect about this
time of the year. Mrs. (President) Foxton
handed the little guest qf honor a motor
brooch, set with pearls and diamonds. Mrs.
Thorne has been treasurer of the hospital
since its beginning. While she is away the
Forsyth lady will wrestle with the accounts.
Mr. Thorne was mayor of this burg some
decades ago.
Mrs. Thorne was partially to blame for
y'T another light meal on the 16th inst., Mrs.
Kingsbury being _ her associate in guilt,
and Mrs. John Hicks the actual instigator
and responsible party. Mrs. Kingsbury is
going to Rome to represent Queensland at
the Quinquennial Conference of the National
Council of Women. Mrs. Hicks’s sister,
Mrs. Spencer Smith, who is from America,
helped to entertain the guests, and wore a
glad rag that left every female present filled
with envy. The pretty Hicks daughters
sang ravishingly at brief intervals.
One of our few female dentists, Miss
Martha Burns, is going to the Tooth Con-
ference in London this year. Furthermore,
Connie Paten, to whom the medical men here
entrust all such patients as require massage,
proposes to holiday shortly in Japan. She
has massaged herself to a shadow.
Mrs. James, of Melbourne Table Talk,
has been with us for a while; also her in-
tensely military husband.
Pianist Hilda Roberts and her mother
left for Sydney by the Cooma on Wednes-
day, and early next week she will be
married quietly to Mr. Presdee. Mark the
qualifying _ word “quietly.” So many of
these musical weddings are deafening in
their uproariousness. I hear that the wed-
ding dress is a perfect gem.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
The Bulletin begins to suspect that our
grandfathers were not the “loyal” old insti-
tutions which the surviving few of them try
to make us believe they ail were. Anyway, in
its extracts from the files of 50 years ago
the Courier quotes this: —
The free Australian colonies threaten that, if transpor-
tation is resumed to Western Australia, they will
pass laws for transporting their criminals to Great
Britain.
Australia, however, stuck to its criminals
and sent Britain its fat landlords instead.
It recalls that when England continued to-
export convicts to Virginia against Yankee
protest, Benjamin Franklin proposed to re-
taliate by landing in Britain cargoes of
American rattlesnakes.
An awful thing has happened in Brisbane
—quite an influential qrowd of hank and
insurance clerks have been calling for a
Wages Board. There was a doubt whether
Percy Adolphus really meant the shameful
tiling, so a ballot was called for by the Indus-
trial Registrar; and, though a majority said
“No,” no less than 226 said “Yes,” and 226
constitute about one-third of the total. And
it was dead-certain that a great many more
than 226 would have said “Yes” if they
could have seen how the question of over-
time was going to be settled. On present
appearances, the clerk who muddles his cash
and has to spend tWo hours finding out the
whereabouts of the missing sixpence would
get heaps of overtime,, while the clear-headed
clerk who never let the sixpence go astray
would get no overtime at all: and until a
plan for overcoming that difficulty can he
suggested the careful clerk said the whole
business had better be hung up. Still there’s
an office management or two that has had a
de’il of a fright.

ANTINEURASTHIN
TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS and WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.
In order that the worth of Antineurasthin may be
tested, a sample supply, together with a treatise on
nervous maladies, will be forwarded to any address
in Australia on receipt of 2d. in stamps to cover
postage by the wholesale representative, H. A. God-

he had not a scrap of hair, and now, after a few months’ treatment with my preparations he has
got a splendid growth of hair. ’
Mr. O’Rourke, Wee Waa, New South Wales, writes: “My head, which was nearly bald has now
come back to its usual growth.”
Mr. Sutherland states: “I had only a little down on my head when I commenced to usp vonr
SPECIAL PARASENE and COSMO LOTION ; now I have a beautiful head of hair.”
Gentlemen who are going bald should use Special Parasene and Cosmo Lotion one at
night and the other in the morning, and wash the head once a week with Shampuna. '

upon the intestines has the happy effect of giving relief in an
almost instantaneous way.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is expressly designed
for country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any of our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will find
this a genuine bargain.
It has a hogskin seat, a plated bar-tree, extra
long flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro-
tecting its interior from the weather. It has a
deep, “sweepy” seat, 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron stirrups, and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/15/- Mention of The
Bulletin when ordering will ensure your having a
leather surcingle given in free, and the saddle will
be forwarded freight paid. It is to be obtained
from J. P. Talty, 388 Sussex Street, Sydney.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Velvette: You’ll need some practice....
Not a Blind Mug: See little wrong with the state-
ments of those two papers (as submitted) concern-
ing M.L.’s alleged naval defence. It is about all
they say of it; likewise, it is about all you say of
it. Finally, it has mostly been said several times.
.... Marcus Superfluous: Do you vouch for the truth
of that paragraph ?.... Homo: You say that happened
some years ago. True, it happened in The Bulliwin
Abo. page.... J.P.C.: (1) If published in a book,
payment is usually on a royalty basis —so much per
copy after a certain number have been sold. (2)
If in (say) The Bulletin from 3d. to 6d. per line.
....A.S.: “Nothing remarkable about the parson’s
wife being a successful punter,” isn’t there i How
many parsons’ wives do you know who punt success-
fully ?.... Mac: Afraid it's your week for being dull.
.....lax: No market here for verse that has been
printed elsewhere. Clad to consider other contribu-
tions .... Miss Gibbs: Always glad to get jests of
your owu make. Judging by some of the samples
submitted, you must be a great age. . . .T. 0.1.: The
Bulletin had a 35th birthday party on January 8.
Anyhow, it would had one if it had remembered in
time... .G.H.D.: Don’t supply place or date of
grievance, and in any case being diddled out of £25
is a very frequent grievance—so frequent that this
paper wouldn’t hold half of it. .. .Kunasarta: Read
it again; “0.K.” certainly didn’t by “birthright”
mean what you think he means... .The Ox: “Doolan’s
Goat” is a poor, emaciated beast who plays no new
capers.... Experto Crede: Even if it is granted that
some books are liable sometimes to pay longer odds
over a successful favorite than the Tote would pay—
and the phenomenon doesn’t occur once in a thousand
times —there are so many other objections to the
bo'okmaking system as to make the argument on
which you rely a negligible one. .. . J.M.lt.: When
a par. appears that you plead guilty to, cut it out,
indicate date and page, and post to accountant, who
will do the rest. . . .L.R.: No use, thanks, for old
poems cut from American papers. It takes so much
time hunting up to see if they haven’t been stolen
from The Bulletin J.F.H. (V.): “The comedy
would occupy three columns.” It won’t. It will
occupy just one column, with a gaping orifice at the
top... .A.W.S.: The name “Madeline” is wailed or
sobbed 27 times—throe times in each verse. That’s
enough to kill any poem....T.H. (Fitzroy) : Put
the shutters up. .. .Elocnonrev: What a frightful
trade-mark to attach to one raw six-line stanza....
F.A.C.: It burnt well. .. . J.A.K.: Useless torrent of
words... .H.H.S. (Tas.) :It has no interest whatever
. ...BayW.: “Workman” has streaks of humor, but it
doesn’t hang together well enough. .. .A.S.H.: Very
plain statement of facts. Doubt if even a trade
paper would look at it. .. .8.F.R.: “I trust it will
meet with a better fate than the last MS. I sent
you. Which MS. I quite agree was rotten.” Trust
you will also agree with us about this 0ne.... Alex.
Scott (Scotland): It is naught. .. .G. 1.: You don’t
sparkle. .. .Walbrow: We hate to be unkind to a
far-travelled screed, but the truth must be told. It
isn’t worth patching. . . .L.M. (V.) : No print
value.... Sarto: Counted 0ut.... Ox: Too slight....
Will J. (V.): Misses by a slight margin. .. .A.M.8.:
Plimsoll rhyme makes rough weather of it.... Jack
B. (M.L.) : It’s rough going all the way... .Thomas
J.: The poems are just what might have been expected
—very young and green. Wait 10 years.... Cuth-
bert F.: That will do, Cuth....John L. C.: What
started you ? We know what will finish you, if you
keep on; but we would like to know what started
you... .Alice: Absurd as it may seem, there is only
a limited demand for this sort of verse:—
Alas, my auntie died so young;
Her praises oft I’ve sweetly sung.
Now she is resting so profound
With bluebells sprouting all around.
.... Albert T.: There is something tragic about your
humor. Better get your teeth into a grand-opera
libretto.... Bondi B.: About the time when the
annual holidays are due, the stock of office curses
runs low and advice is too scarce to be thrown
about recklessly. The best thing you can do is to
begin at the beginning and learn a little grammar.
When you have done, that, you can start after
Macaulay again... . Demon: The manuscript that
looks promising on one page and slumps horribly on
the next, , inviting the sub-editor to spend
half a day tinkering the bad part, in order to even
things up and made the whole fit for print, is pos-
sibly the worst-hated contribution this office receives.
It flickers on the edge of the basket and tantalises
the busy pen-pusher who would like to rescue it, but
can’t s.ee how he can spare the time... .Plainsman:
Promptly condemned. You wrote it with a stirrup-
iron, didn’t you? Mopoke Bill: The tattered
remnants of the song competition still continue to
arrive. Part of your yell:—
Australia! Australia, the land of the free
Where beautiful women are plain for to see.
(Are you referring now to Australia as a whole, or
to some of the current theatrical leg-shows ? Cer-
tainly beautiful women were never before “so plain
for to see.” And the managers will make ’em even
plainer if they think the free public will stand it.)
....Henry: Ditchwater is champagne compared with
your poem. ... Efana: You have ideas, but you don’t
know how to get rid of them. They crawl from
under your verses like slow pedestrians who have
been run down by trams C.G.: No use sending
it to us after it has been published elsewhere. We
want to print (and pay for) original Australian
matter.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Flo: It would take an ocean of good intentions to
cover work of that sort H.S.: “Distant relation”
joke has seen better days—many of them. ... W.S.:
Even if your drawing was any good, which it isn’t
and never will be, the private letter which you have
scrawled all over the mar°-in is in the road of repro-
duction. When you submit a thing of the kind it
isn’t necessary to wallow on the spare space with the
ill-written news: “I am submitting a drawing.”....
Oho: No, “the accompanying sketch” is not “accepted
by us.” It wouldn’t be accepted by a decent canni-
bal.
Every third or so the Sydney papers
print a story to the effect that, Carmichael
being in poor health, he will probably drop
out of Holman’s Ministry, whereupon he
may be appointed general manager or busi-
ness manager of the N.S.W. railways. Hig
qualifications for the billet are. apparently,
that he is in poor health and is by profession
an accountant. Poor health may be the
thing N. S. Wales is looking for in the man
to whom it proposes to give just about the
most strenuous job at its disposal: but the
fact that a man is an accountant may easily
be given too much weight. Anybody can be
an accountant —there are hundreds and
hundreds of them in Sydney, and most of
them have less practical knowledge of how
to run a business than a first-class barrow-
man has.. Most times the accountant isn’t
a man with either much initiative or much
imagination; and the business manager who
hasn’t a lot of both of those things isn’t
cut out for success. Carmichael, who has
made a very good Minister for Education,
might also possibly make a railway manager;
but the people who are inspiring the para-
graphs suggesting that he should be given
the job really ought to find spme better rea-
son for it than that he is “by profession an
accountant” in poor health.

The portrait of Melbourne’s first P.M.,
the late J. A. Panton, was unveiled at the
new City Court this week. The canvas is
by Mi's. Muntz-Adams, a daughter of civil-
engineer T. B. Muntz, of Malvern. The
bird-percli half-way through the name is due
to the fact that, when taking to studio-life,
the lady resurrected her family-name to dis-
tinguish herself from the mighty army of
plain Adamses. A Muntz brother is Vic-
toria’s “court photographer,” or its equiva-
lent, his highly-superior pictures of John
Fuller in bavgy pants and of John Madden
in a tight-waisted coat being done with the
least possible showing of bagginess and
tightness.
About an Irish gentleman:—
R. W. Pennefather (please pronounce it “Penny-
feather”), who died at Perth on Friday, aged 62,
belonged to an Irish family of lawyers. One of the
crowd, Edward, was Chief Justice of the Queen’s
Bench, and presided at the trial of O’Connell, Duffy
and others in 1844. Another, Richard, was a Baron
of the Exchequer, and sat on the Bench when quite
blind and over 80 years of age. Still another,
Frederick William, grandson of the Chief Justice
alluded to, was called to the English Bar in 1877,
and came to South Australia as private secretary to
Governor Jervois in 1881, and served with him
also when he was Governor of Maoriland. The late
Westralian came to Victoria early, graduated in
Arts and Law at the Melbourne University, and
practised in Victoria and N. S. Wales for 15 years.
He went to Westralia 16 years ago, and entered the
Assembly. He was Attorney-General four years and
an acting Judge in 1903.

Cuticura Ointment Cured.
Mooroopna, Yic. —“I was suffering from
an attack of eczema for about one month.
The eczema affected my head, wrists and
ankles and the itching was horrible. I
could not get a good night’s sleep for more
than a week, and soon it came out on the
parts mentioned above in a scaly rash. I
tried other ointments for a time but they
did not seem to do me any good. I saw the
Cuticura Remedies advertised, and thought
I would try the Cuticura Ointment, which
I bought and applied as directed, and I am
glad to say it has completely cured me after
using two tins.” (Signed) P. Chadaneau.

dressed the skin came away. I brought her
home and using Cuticura Ointment for
anointing, and Cuticura Soap for bathing,
as directed, it has entirely renewed the parts
affected.

If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the- natural shade
of youth, or younger years.

BURLEIGH
From a recent
photograph.
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT is of special interest to every MAN
AND WOMAN who has previously tried other HAIR-GROWING PREPARA-
TIONS. If you have HAD NO SUCCESS WITH OTHERS, please write to
me. I REFRAIN from expressing any personal opinion as to other prepara-
tions, but point to the vast array of letters received from patrons, who,
HAVING TESTED numerous advertised compounds, washes, etc., without
benefit, used my pomade, and FOUND IT TO BE EXACTLY AS REPRE-
SENTED—A TRUE HAIR GROWER. It is always prepared in accordance
with the formula with which my name has become famous, and which is
endorsed by NOTED ANALYTICAL EXPERTS OF ENGLAND, GERMANY,
FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES. It can be shown by many letters
which I receive that, IN A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FIRST APPLICATION,
THE HAIR BEGINS TO GROW, AND CONTINUES UNTIL A HEALTHY,
STRONG, PERMANENT GROWTH IS MANIFEST.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff, baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well
the humiliation that they cause. There is no need, however, of such conditions. These troubles can
be quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
10,000 Free Trial Boxes
My offer is a straightforward, honest proposition from a business man to sensible men and women.
The merit of my TRUE HAIR GROWER is in the preparation itself, not in the advertising. If you
will write to me I will send you a TRIAL BOX of the JOHN CRAVEN BURLEIGH TRI i.
GROWER. I make this offer because I want YOU to know just what my True Hair Grower will do.
I was bald, it cured me, and it has cured thousands of others. Package will be sent secuiely sea e

“J.D.”: The printers’ strike in the Speck has pro-
vided the unique spectacle of the most vigorously-con-
ducted Labor paper in the Commonwealth marching
arm in arm with its bitterest Tory enemy every day,
and sleeping in the same cubicle every night. The
Hobart Mercury and the Daily Post have for con-
venience been printed in the one establishment by
the working proprietors of local jobbing offices. Ihe
cable page of each has been identical, but on the
leader page the ill-assorted pair have called each
other everything but respectable. There have been
no other pages in which to quarrel, as all the rest
of the paddock has been full of advertisements. The
Post directors, suddenly finding themselves up against
an extraordinary difficulty, apparently took the only
available method of protecting the shareholders pro-
perty from destruction. To have ceased publication
would have spelt sudden death ; to have ceased publi-
cation without consulting the shareholders (all Labor-
ites or Labor leagues and unions) would have de-
served censure; to have attempted publication with-
out the aid of other offices would have been sheer
lunacy. #
By a coincidence which was probably engineered by
the Devil, in its first issue after the printers struck
work, Hobart Mercury supplied in its sermon column
a fiery harangue by the late Rev. T a Image, headed
“Workmen, to Arms!” from the text: “He that
earneth wages, earneth wages to be put into a bag
with holes”—Haggai i., 6. It was inappropriate in
various ways. In the first place, Talmage never put
his wages in a bag with holes ; he knew a lot more
than that. Nor did he put the whole of his wages in
one bag. Then the old Mercury compositors had no
wages just then to put in a bag; also, they had
got the sack. In any case, it is only the most reck-
less toiler who bags his surplus. The wise one,
when he has drawn his princely remuneration on
Saturday, and paid the rent, and bought food and
clothes and sundries for himself and the wife and
the six kiddies, packs the rest of the money away m
kegs in the cellar against a rainy day. He does that
out of profound disrespect for the bank of which
the boss is a director. Haggai, apparently, had no
keg and no cellar, and hadn’t even the price ot a
decent bag. „
“M.E.”: I turned eagerly to an article entitled
“The Australian Press” in Nov. World’s Work, by
Milner Macmaster, and found seven pages of absorb-
ing statements about the Herald, an evening paper
which I learnt was published in Melbourne. I learned,
also, that “The history of the Herald is, m brief,
the history of Victoria.” Enthusiastic descriptions
are given of that paper’s new plant; but 'while the
author devotes half a page to the fact that the
machines have a stop-press device, the press of the
rest of Australia gets little more than a page, this
is compensated for by photographs of A meeting
of the Herald’s directors,” the barn-like Herald
building, the Herald’s reporters’ room, and the
Herald’s machinery.' Also, we are informed that
“the Herald is essentially a newspaper. the
Herald is mentioned 27 times by name; the only
other papers mentioned are the Weekly limes,
apparently published by the Herald which I note
is “one of the most widely circulated of Victorian
weeklies,” the Argus, the Age and The Bulletin-
and each of these suburban rags gets mentioned but
once. Next time I go down to Melbourne I mean to
buy a Herald. # *
From* the Journal op the Institute -op
Journalists, London: —
“EDITOR-IN-CHIEF wanted for a leading Aus-
tralian Daily. Must be a thoroughly capable man
with a good grasp of public questions and an all-
round knowledge of the value of news. Will have
an ample staff both on the Editorial and News side
of the paper. Liberal salary. Age not over 40.
Apply with particulars of career, which will be
treated confidentially, to 0 723, Offices of the In-
stitute.”
Well, assuming that this cry to Macedonia comes
from the Sydney Telegraph office, that concern is at
least consistent. As a Foreign-trade paper it natu-
rally doesn’t think that much besides wool and
wheat can be raised in Australia —though, when you
come to think of it, why shouldn’t a bale of wool or
a bag of wheat edit a “Liberal” Freetrade sheet in
Australia ?
* * * *
“N or M.”: Someone, a week or two ago, com-
plained to the “Inky Way” of newspaper punctua-
tion. It is the press’s unnatural hankering after
figures that worries me. “About a hundred persons
is a roughly-estimated clump; but “about 100” is
an unsuccessful census. The poet who writes of a
thousand thousand” doesn’t mean 1,000,000, but
something uncountable, and you knock all the imagi-
native quality out of “the cattle upon a thousand
hills” when you put the mountains into figures. It
recalls the tombstone artist who, being pressed for
room, set it on record that “A virtuous woman is 5/-
to her husband.”
* * * *
“p.”: Remember the noise that William Kidston
made when, as Treasurer of Queensland, he woke
up one morning about nine years ago and found the
“strictly confidential” draft of a Bill printed in full
in the Daily Mail? The number of printers and
Government officials who were called up by William
the Great alarmed even Brisbane. But this is the
simple story of how the sacred Bill was “stolen.”
Going up Queen-street one morning I was hailed by
a member of the editorial staff of one of the dailies.
“Kidston,” he whispered, “dropped his Money Bill
last night in the House, and So-and-So and So-and-So
picked it up and are minding it for him. If you
come down to-night I can get it from them for you.
It would make a big boom for the Mail.” I hurried
down in a cab, and, having received the precious
Bill, drove furiously to the Mail office. Next after-
noon, when the “sensation” was burning hot, I met
the late John Leahy in the street. Leahy was angry.
“Why the didn’t you put that in the Courier
as well as the Mail?” he asked. I told him I had
nothing to do with the Courier, and didn’t know
they wanted it. “Didn’t that [l5 blanks here] tell
you to put it in the Courier, too?” 1 was sure he
didn’t. [Another 15 exclamatory blanks.] The Mail,
though, didn’t pay £3OO for the “use” of that
Bill, as was frequently stated by those who didn’t
know. All it paid was my cab fare.
BALLADE OF LOVE AND FOOD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My Dora is my chiefest joy;
I love the ’witching grace of her,
The sweet and smiling face of her,
Her lips so red, her ways so coy
But I, a bard (unhappy fate!) —
Finances in a sorry plight—
Am driven hard to liquidate
My dainty Dora’s appetite!
When I would lunch on fish and chips,
Then caviare my love demands,
And snipe, though well she understands
These must be earned with verse and quips.
With devilled oysters doth she play ;
When conscious that her teeth so white
Are chewing up a roundelay,
It does but whet her appetite!
The benedictine that she drinks
For me means lengthy hours of toil,
Her fish is cooked in midnight oil;
Yet e’en from this she never shrinks.
She swallows sonnets ev’ry day ;
As much champagne as I can write
Goes in the customary way—
It does but wet her appetite!
L’Envoi.
Three stanzas and an envoy may
Content my love for lunch to-day ;
But much more yet have I to write,
For there’s her supper appetite!
VICTORIA.

How to
Withstand
Hot
Weather.
THE HEATED TERM.
The heated term is withstood without
a whimper by those people who have a
healthy stomach. Hot weather cannot
hurt the man or woman whose stomach
and digestive organs are perfectly
healthy. But you go into December or
January with a disordered stomach, and
see what the result will be.
SUNSTROKE.
Sunstroke attacks only the man or
woman whose stomach or digestive or-
gans are too feeble to protect the
strength, and maintain one’s physical
power to resist the depressing effects of
the summer’s sun.
SUMMER DIET.
Summer diet, with all its vegetables
and unripe fruit, adds its unstable influ-
ence to the depressing effects of hot
weather, causing a still greater decline
in one’s strength and vitality.
IF THE STOMACH IS OUT OF
ORDER.
Ninety-nine out of every one hundred
people whose health and strength run
down in summer allow their stomach or
digestive organs to get out of order.
This is easy enough—in fact, it is hard
to prevent without the use of some thor-
oughly reliable digestant.
TAKE DR. SHELDON’S DIGES-
TIVE TABULES.
One of Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tab-
ules, taken after meals, is not only the
thoroughly reliable digestant, but it con-
tains great tonic and reconstructive
properties as well. This famous remedy
enables the stomach and digestive or-
gans to thoroughly digest, assimilate,
and contribute to the tissues all the
nourishment that is contained in such
food as may be eaten.
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules lay the foundation for health and the upbuild-
ing of strength by purifying and sweetening the glands and membranes or the
stomach, and by supplying natural juices necessary to perfect digestion, assimua-
tion and nutrition. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules prevent Colic, Cholera,
Diarrhoea, Flux, Dysentery and summer complaints generally, and their use will
cure Indigestion and Chronic Dyspepsia permanently. Dr. Sheldons Digestive
Tabules are good alike for young and old. Sold at 1/6 and 2/o per tin.

The Devotee.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Clarice kneels in prayer
The dim and hallowed light
Falls softly on her hair,
And on her slim hands white.
Rose-hues and violet
Stream down upon her face,
So serious-sweet, and yet
So filled with youthful grace.
No one can doubt she sees
White angels as she prays,
And hears the melodies
The Hosts of Glory raise.
Her rapt eyes, upward cast,
Behold the Shining Ones,
Who throng the City vast
Lit by the Sun of suns.
For such as she were they,
And when her lips are dumb
And her warm body clay
Like them she shall become.
A chanting host, they tread
The jasper streets, white-stoled,
With halo-circled head
And harp of ourest gold.
Enrapt, removed, demure,
With round, white, slender throat
\nd raised face pale and pure,
She hears each golden note.
Her soul in sacred tryst
With solemn beauty dreams ;
The circlet on her wrist
Gives back the painted gleams.
Her arched, ripe, rosebud lips
In muted tones aspire ;
And dimmed in far eclipse,
The world’s red lures retire.
Her heart (the world remote)
Takes wings to Heaven’s gate ;
The rubies at her throat
Burn red and passionate. I
Men laud her, love her, think
Her ways an angel’s ways;
Her pearl-hung ears grow pink
To hear their song of praise.
She wings the world alone —
A white, unmated dove;
Her heart has never known
The laughing lure of love.
About her winsome charms,
Her soft and shapely form,
No lover locks his arms
With kisses soft and warm.
A still, tall candle-flame
In cloistral shadows set
She seems, untouched by shame —
And yet.... and yet... .and yet!
Like some pale lily tall,
A perfect front she shows,
And yet—in spite of all—
I wonder if God knows?
When Clarice kneels to pray,
A waste of prayer it seems;
She talks with saints by day,
With angels in her dreams.
What need has she for prayer?
Needs here —in yonder slums,
Where Sin with cheeks aflare
And rocking footsteps comes.
Needs here —in yonder den
Where, lost to hope and fear,
Daubed drabs and drunken men
Forget the world in beer.

The Story of All-e-same.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ 1 LL-E-SAME” is not what they call
her at the Mission, where she may
- J — % ~ s till, for all I know, be going fur-
tively about the endless round of drudgery
which has occupied her these ten years past
—a flat-breasted, withered beldame, prema-
turely aged, even for her Island race.
Only the old-time traders and Government
officials whom whisky and blackwater fever
have spared call her by that name when
speaking of her. As regards the Government
men, at any rate, this is seldom, since such
matters are apt to get into print, and then
the gods of High Olympus frown and mutter
and issue peremptory proclamations in the
Government Gazette, forbidding the publi-
cation of official secrets, while the lion and
unicorn on top of the page wink at each
other across the coat of _ arms. Outsiders,
however, are not so particular, and so the
world is the wiser, if not the better.
The part of All-e-same’s story that is told
here belongs to the days before she went to
stay at the Mission, stepping thither, half
reluctant, from the shadow of the gallows.
To begin in the middle, it may be as well
to say that she was called “All-e-same” be-
cause of the delighted ejaculation which
burst from her when she first beheld herself,
in all the paraphernalia of alleged civilisa-
tion, in the long mirror in the room of the
Missionary’s wife at Ivapa-levi: the mirror,
I am told, being there till this day to witness
if I lie above the ordinary. “All-e-same
sinabada,” “Just like a white lady,” the
delighted little pagan cried in her “pidgin”
English; and “All-e-same” she became for
the future among white and brown alike.
The real beginning of all the trouble was
the Missionary, and when it is added that
he was a well-meaning missionary experi-
enced readers will realise that the trouble
referred to was of a genuine brand. When
Maxwell, who was something of a contractor
for pavements in Hades himself, with his
virulence tempered by a constitutional tired-
ness and a tendency to regard an ineffectual
past through smoke-flavored glasses of
whisky, blew in upon the scene, he was so
obviously a brand to be plucked from the
burning that the good Missionary immedi-
ately rose to the occasion.
Maxwell called himself a trader, but in
that part of the Pacific grit and energy com-
bined with a predatory disposition are re-
quired for success, and consequently his
traffic in beche-de-mer, copra and other odd-
ments did not assume alarming proportions.
Thus it was that when a hard-pushed Lieu-
tenant-Governor came along and offered him
the position of Government Agent for the
semi-civilised district, Maxwell jumped at
the chance. The billet would enhance his
standing with the natives, and it did not pre-
vent him carrying on business on his own
account, while he maintained Government
authority in his district as time and occa-
sion offered. He was given a small squad
of Armed Constabulary to assist him; dour
men from the Northern Rivers, who spoke
no tongue but their own and fraternised not
at all with the lively people of Ivapa-levi.
Maxwell found in his new circumstances
a decided change for the better. Trade im-
proved, and if he used his police chiefly for
the purpose of “recruiting” labor for his
plantation he did no more than every
Government Agent of his day. It is, of
course, superfluous to say that the Govern-
ment Agent system has long been abolished
in the land in which this story is cast.
Fairly settled in life, and waxing fat, it
was inevitable that Maxwell should look
about him for a helpmate. There were
good and sufficient reasons why he should
not seek a companion among his own kind
on the mainland whence he had drifted, so,
very naturally, he called to his aid a pro-
minent citizen of the large sea-coast village
near which he lived.
This headman, like most of his sort, was
a sorcerer of infamous renown, and in the
intervals of imposition and extortion
carried on a marriage-broking business (to
give it a seemly name). As a result of his
conference with the old ruffian, and after a
considerable amount of haggling, Maxwell
paid over a stiff sum in trade and received
to bed and board the young and prepossess-
ing damsel who afterwards became All-e-
-same. She was the niece of the eminent
magician who conducted the deal.
For some little time, then, matters went
well enough. The lady had been duly taken
in matrimony according to the custom of
her people, and at a very flattering figure
which enabled her to snub her dearest
friends with all the aplomb of a Society
hostess. Moreover, she was free-handed with
Maxwell’s trade tobacco, and consequently
was highly popular in her set. With
other matters, too, she was very well con-
tent. She went about clad in native inno-
cence, like her friends, or, if it pleased her,
had her pick of the excruciating trade
dresses in the store. When the tinned deli-
catessen of her white spouse palled on her,
she was free to fall back on the glutinous
taro, or the dreadful dried fish beloved of
her people, and no one said her nay. She
smoked Maxwell’s cheroots, and hauled his
muddy boots off when he staggered to bed in
the evenings, and showed the greatest good
humor and satisfaction with her lot. Re-
garded as a successful marriage of conveni-
ence, the sorcerer’s handiwork could hardly
have been bettered in our own enlightened
midst.
It was at this point in the narrative that
the Serpent made his appearance in the
wings. “Serpent” is hardly a fair descrip-
tion of the Missionary, who was a breezy,
off-hand sort of fellow, with a manner that
was taking with people until they
caught his eye. He entered the sordid little
Eden, however, quite in the best manner of
his professional opponent, but he sought the
ear of Maxwell only, and left his lady alone
for the time being. Beginning gently, he
warmed to his text as he found his hearer
sulky and recalcitrant. He referred to the
Wages of Sin, the Offence against Heaven,
and the necessity of doing the Right Thing.
Also, he cited the Governor’s displeasure, in
a tone that suggested it as being more likely
to take effect than any of the other admoni-
tions. When these failed to move Maxwell,
who was unusually pot-valiant, the Mission-
ary tried his last expedient. He recalled to
Maxwell that his people were still alive in a
West of England parsonage, and might be
interested to hear of him. Also, he re-
called a little matter or two which Maxwell
thought he had buried beyond resurrection
these 10 years past. Maxwell threw up his
hands about here, and bitterly regretting,
with maudlin tears, that lie was too drunk
to assault his spiritual adviser, consented to
anything and everything.
After a seemly interval, during which the
bride took up her quarters under the Mis-
sionary’s roof, the wedding was . cele-
brated with all pomp and flummery in the
big church, built with money earned by
Kapa-levi natives in blood and sweat on the
Thursday Island pearlers. It was on this
occasion that All-e-same bestowed her new
name upon herself. Maxwell wore a coat
for the first time since he had set foot on
the island, and with the assistance of the
Missionary’s chief of staff, a greasy Samoan,
and a more than sufficient load of whisky,
came through the ordeal without accident.
Perhaps, even then, if Mrs. Maxwell —de
jure and all the rest of it now —had been
left to her own peaceful path, with the
trade tobacco, the nudity and the delectable
dried fish, this story,i if it had ever been
written at all, might have, had a different
ending. The mischief of it was that she
was not so left in peaceful, primal depravity
to work out her own weird.
The Missionarv had a wife who was even
more well-meaning and less successful at
hitting the mark than he was himself. A
campaign of civilisation was directed by the
pair against All-e-same, who, under their
tutelage, was to lay aside the instincts of a
thousand generations of savagery in the
course of a few months. By way of a start
All-e-same was baptised, and of course she
was christened “Magdalen.” . The sacred
water dropped from the Missionary’s fingers
on to some blue tattoo-marking on the girl’s
forehead which told to. the initiated the story
of a symbolic worship which was hoary
when Christianity was unborn. All-e-same
passed over what she considered as a weari-

KIDNEY TROUBLE COMES ON QUIETLY.
Often those in the greatest danger from
kidney complaint do not know their kidneys
are diseased, and so the trouble is neglected
until it reaches an incurable stage. For
kidney disease comes on quietly —may have
been in the system for years without being
suspected. Cure your kidneys while you can ,
by starting with Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills at once if you have any such clear
signs of kidney or bladder trouble as •
Gravel, Stone,

Backache, Lumbago,
Rheumatism.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills relieve the
kidneys and bladder like ordinary medicines
relieve the bowels. They dispose of the
excess uric acid which is the great cause of
rheumatism, backache, lumbago and stone,
and they release the accumulated water in
dropsy.

Sydney People Cured
A Sydney Woman .
Mrs. A. Thompson, 17 Hume Street, Crow’s Nest, North
Sydney, says: “Ever since childhood I have suffered a lot
from kidney trouble, caused in the first place by a severe
cold, which settled in my back and kidneys. At times I
felt completely run-down, and my back ached so much that
I could hardly get about, while stooping was an impossi-
bility. , The kidney secretions were disordered, and con-
tained a red sediment. For years I was treated by different
medical men, and was also in Hospital for a month, but
nothing did me any good. One day I was urged to try
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and as they were spoken so
highly of I got some, and used them with most pleasing
result. After taking two bottles I felt better than I had
for a long time, and four bottles of these grand pills cured
me completely, and I now feej splendid. I strongly advise
all who suffer from kidney trouble to take Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, which are, I consider, the finest kidney remedy
known.”
A Sydney Man .
Mr. R. Spring, Park Gate Hotel, Parramatta, says:— “l
make the following statement so that other sufferers may
know that there is an unfailing cure for backache in Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. Off and on for many years I
suffered torture from a bad back; pains would catch me
across the loins, and I could not stand up straight. I was
frequently laid up for days at a time. I consulted doctors,
but their treatment was ineffectual. I used dozens of
remedies, but it was only waste of time and money. At
last I was advised by a friend to try Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, so got some at onpe, and I am pleased to
say this wonderful remedy cured me, and I feel a different
man. It is grand to be free of backache, and I am grateful
to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for my cure.”
Five years later, -Mr. Spring says:—“The above state-
ment is true every word, and I can now add the important
fact that I am still well to-day. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills deserve praise; I will always recommend them.”

some and inexplicable performance placidly
enough. The blundering attempts of the
Missionary’s wife to teach her to read and
write tried her lazy good-humor more sorely,
and when she found herself, in addition,
compelled to wear the hateful European
clothing, and to observe many strange and
irritating “don’ts” and “must nots,” the situ-
ation began to get beyond her capacity. The
excommunication of her beloved betel-chew-
ing sent her stark, raving mad for naif a
day. When she had cooled down, she found
that Mrs. Missionary, a cold, lymphatic per-
son with all the deadly obstinacy of her type,
was ready to commence where she had left
off, and then for a time All-e-same fell into
a didl and despairing routine.
The change in his spouse was by no means
acceptable to Maxwell. The cheery native girl
who was clean and' comely in a grass rami
was slatternly and dirty in her ill-fitting
European clothing. Maxwell dived deeper
into drink to drown his disgust, and when he
was not snoring drunk he was nagging at All-
e-same with all the rancor of the recovery
stage. Now, nagging is a thing that no sav-
age, however civilised, can endure for long,
and after a month or two of unadulterated
misery All-e-same began to consider in her
hidden heathen heart whether there was not
a way out of it all, preferably a quick and
secret way that would make an end for ever
of the nagging and the books and the boots.
While she was in this frame of mind there
came the Man, who made the Hour for him-
self later, as all men who are Men do.
One evening, after an unusually embittered
passage with the Missionary’s wife, who
flounced off to the Mission in a state of highly
exasperated righteousness. All-e-same flung
off her hated trappings and went down the
village to see her respected uncle on the
mother’s side.
This venerable philanthropist was in an
amiable mood. He sat in the cool evening
air on the platform in front of his house,
benevolently regarding a fine pig which he
had that afternoon succeeded in extorting
from a near-by village under penalty of a
sending of devils. Beside the scorcerer sat
a stranger—young, handsome and athletic,
his bow and quiver and wooden shield shaped
like the figure “8” proclaiming him a moun-
taineer from some village far up on the
jungle-covered slopes of the great range.
For a long time All-e-same spoke with her
uncle, who later called the new-comer into
consultation. The sun went down and the
short twilight slipped into darkness. Still the
three spoke earnestly together, till the women
had ceased flitting about the cooking fires,
and the children had all gone, and only the
grunts of the scavenging pigs broke the
silence.
When All-e-same reached home that night
Maxwell was deep in his usual drunken sleep.
The woman looked at him curiously before
she blew out the kerosene lamp and slipped
down on her mat. I would not like to think
that there was no pity in that look, though
it is doubtful.
After this All-e-same w T as frequently at her
uncle’s house. Maxwell soon ceased to won-_
der at her absences, even if he noticed them/
Every day he drank solidly from noon until
evening, when he collapsed and was put to bed
by his disdainful police, or by the disrepu-
table little ruffian who officiated as cookboy.
Meanwhile, his wife was in constant confer-
ence with her mountaineer lover, who came
and went continually, or with her villainous
uncle in his dark and smoky house. Later,
other members of the village, friends and
relatives, joined the party, and the whispered
consultations were carried on far into the
night, the old man planning and the others
Nnodding acquiescence or interpolating sug-
gestions in excited whispers. During these
■days Maxwell went up and down among the
people. There was no sign nor hint of any-
thing untoward, and to the Missionary, the
Samoan teacher and the police, aliens all, no
one breathed a word of what every man,
woman and child of the village knew was in
the air. The very cookboy who brought
Maxwell his morning coffee knew, and kept
silence, waiting inscrutably for what the
. future held. The village people too, who had
no cause to hate him—who had traded with
him, stolen from him and received gifts from
him —went on trading, thieving and accept-
ing presents with the suave smiling imper-
sonal treachery that has made their name
notorious.
The end, after all this expectation, was
very simple. One evening All-e-same did not
go down to her uncle’s house. The women
and children in the village got indoors early,
and even the pigs were brought into the
houses, since matters might miscarry, and
the northern police were not ' parti-
cular as to what they emptied their
Snider carbines at, if once they were wakened
to a sense of the situation. The constables
slept soundly enough, however, in their hut
a hundred yards or so away from Maxwell’s
native-built house. Up on the hillside, half
a mile away, the white buildings of the
Mission shone wliitely in the moonlight, and
the drone of the surf on the distant reef was
a lullaby. Apparently All-e-same was the
only person in Maxwell’s quarters that night
who was disturbed by the insistent chatter of
a flying fox. She slipped down from the high
verandah into the black shadow of a group of
bread-fruit trees and the chattering stopped.
Half a dozen men were there —her lover and
some men of his following, and, lastly, her
uncle, with an ominous loop of spit rattan,
tough and flexible as steel wire, quivering in
his hand.
A few whispered words and, silent as
shadows, the men went up the steps. Savage
as she was, the girl felt her knees giving under
her, and staggering under the house she
dropped to the ground in an agony of wait-
ing. She could hear the gentle, bare footsteps
as they passed into the sleeping-room above
her. Then, suddenly, after a maddening
spell of silence, the floor of split palm-
stems squeaked and strained at its rattan
lashings as a deadly and voiceless struggle
began above her. The flimsy house shook
and swayed on its piles, till she buried her
fingers in her ears and threw herself face
downward on the ground. Presently the
sounds died away, and one by one the
shadows flitted down from the verandah.
The mountaineer stood over her. “It, is
finished,” he said simply, wiping the sweat
from his brow, while his broad chest heaved
and panted. “Quickly with the keys, and
let us to the store, for we must be in the
mountains before daybreak.”
For a moment All-e-same sat, bewildered
at the thought of what lay in the room
above her. Then, rousing herself at a
second sharp command, she drew the keys
from about her neck and led the way to the
store, which must be plundered before the
long flight for safety began.

“Can yer pay me?”
“No, I carn't /”
“Well, that settles it! I’ll instruct me

awful knobby fist of his gigantic caDtor
quivering under his nose, and realised that
the discussion had swung back to the start-
ing-point. He began obstinately to tem-
porise; meanwhile his right hand, sliding
along the wall, found an electric light
switch and nervously clicked it on and off
in a meaningless kind of way. It made a
sort of accompaniment to their stupid
wrangle, now filling the gloomy hallway of
the building with waves of angry sound.
The clenched hand was again wavering
threateningly before the little man’s face
when the furious sound of boots hurriedlv
descending the stairs was heard. The big
man, being quite engrossed in his quarrel
ignored the interruption; but the face of
the threatened party seemed to light up with
hope.
Tt was ° nly when th e hoots came thunder-
l ng down th e last flight that the attacker
began to take notice. He turned just a
second too late to prevent the gigantic store-
man who filled them getting an irresistible
trick-hold on his arms and rushing him
out of the place.
He did not come back.. Few bullies do
once they know that a superior force awaits
them. The storeman returned alone glow-
ing with success. “Got rid of ’im orright!

“He was kickin’ up er row erbout er let-

lowed him deferentially upstairs. “Blimey!

Quality and Price
in the matter of Machine Tools
Favoritism in business is a bygone sentiment. Buyers
are looking for the best goods at the lowest prices,
and the manufacturer that can meet their demand gets
the trade.
;■■■ _» •o, ■. C".~ ; v ;
That does not mean that the lowest price always gets
the business. Nor should it. , Quality must come first.
Without it there can be no true economy.
In Machine Tool buying you will get the best
service from Goodall’s because we represent makers
who have long held the leadership from the quality
standpoint. And this leadership has resulted in pro-
duction sufficiently heavy to bring the price to a low
measure. For these reasons you will consult your
own interests by at least writing us for details and
quotations on any machinery you may need. Modern,
high-speed Tools are our specialty—Quality is our
watchword.
