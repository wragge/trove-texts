ONE MORE
WEEK
TO THE GREEKS
EMERALD HILL theatre, physically
the most beautiful in Victoria, has been
auctioned. The buyers are a Greek cul-
tural organisation, and what would
Greeks know about drama?
ALL RIGHT NOW
FOR REG LIVERMORE, this year
has been filled with two things his
television show, “I’m Alright Now,” and
the house he is building at Church
Point, near Sydney. The house goes on,
Livermore . . . not a narcissist
but the show, in ironic contradiction
of its title, has ended production and
Livermore’s contract with the ABC has
finished with it.
“I admit the news that my contract
wouldn’t be renewed threw me into a
flat spin at first,” he said this week,
“especially since I’ve started building
the house, but I know it would have
been hard for the ABC to put me into
anything else this year. After all, I know
people who are sick to death of me
now. But they say the year after next
may be different and I hope it
is.”
Meanwhile, rakish in a black-and-
grey jacket of awning-sized stripes, he
was feeling philosophic about his im-
mediate future a part as The Mad
Hatter in a Melbourne production of
“Alice in Wonderland” and some
theatre-restaurant work.
“It can’t do me any harm and maybe
it’ll do me some good. I have a pretty
awful voice, so probably singing is one
side of things I should leave alone,,
but I do love musicals. If I’m doing a
straight play, I find myself wondering
REAL SENTIMENT
THE PROCESS of “sorting out the
life we’ve lived” is the way Barbara
Blackman sums up her first book,
which is a collection of autobiographi-
cal pieces.
Titled “The Little Lives of Certain
Chairs, a Table or Two and Other
Inanimates of Our Acquaintance,” the
book is to be published by the Queens-
land University Press next October and
is an impressionistic re-creation of
feelings rather than facts, feelings set
in motion by the articles and pieces of
furniture which give names .to the
essays.
Since she married Charles Black-
man, the painter, 17 years ago, and
went to live in an old coachhouse
converted into a studio, Barbara Black-
man has lived in 14 different houses in
four different cities.
During the first ten years of their
marriage, Blackman’s paintings were
virtually unknown, but the winning of
the Helena Rubenstein Scholarship in
1960 brought him the beginnings of
both financial security and recognition
as a painter. After the scholarship win,
the Blackmans lived in London for five
years.
“I suppose you could say the first
section of the book, about the first
years of our marriage, deals with the
setting up of a life. In the next, we
are trying to make the marriage com-
patible with domesticity, and by the
third the sense of home and house
has become transportable.
“A house is not the basis of our
life. The main thing is our whole
family’s commitment to Charles’ work.
So the objects I write about are not
important hardly any of them are
still with us it is the people who
move around them.”
The Blackmans had two homes in
London a 1730 terrace house on the
outskirts of the city, and, later, a flat
closer to Central London. They now
have a house in Sydney, which is hung
with several of Blackman’s paintings,
most of them studies of their children.
“I find it very hard to part with pic-
tures of the children. I try to keep
most of them.
“Charles’ paintings don’t actually
appear in the book, but I suppose
people who knew them could pick out
elements I’ve written about which have
appeared in the paintings, too. At one
time we seemed to have a lot of things
in a blue checked material. I had a
dress and there were some curtains.
Well, the curtains appear in the book,
while Charles has used the dress in a
painting.
“Probably the only things we still
have which I’ve written about are
some cane chairs. I’ve done two pieces
—‘The White Cane Chairs’ and ‘The
White Cane Chairs Again’—because
Charles has now painted them in
psychedelic colors.
“I can’t spell, and I don’t think it’s
important, but I also can’t punctuate,
and that is important. But my editor,
armed with ‘Webster’s Dictionary,’ got
us there. The book took about six
weeks to write.
“I used a cassette as somebody else
might use a notebook, changing things
as I went, then taping the final draft.
I am not totally blind. For instance,
I can see these paintings in the room,
because they are still. But I could
never go to look at paintings in a
gallery.”
After graduating from university,
Mrs. Blackman did some child-
psychology work dealing with children’s
paintings, but her blindness prevented
her from going on with it. She has
written poetry, and is now thinking
about a second book. “I think people
are too afraid of sentiment these days
not sentimentality, but real senti-
ment. And I think it can be successful
if you introduce the comic into it.
That’§ what I hope I’ve done in this
book.”—SANDRA HALL
ALL THEIR OWN WORK
It is not my conscious desire to
follow the pattern of life of my uncle,
Somerset Maugham, but I’d (be an
absolute fool if I didn’t follow such
parts of it that I consider a good
example, such as breaking away from
Britain, as he did, at 50, and approach-
ing writing with an attitude of pro-
fessionalism.
Robin Maugham
To those who initially feel that there
are advantages in Australia-wide
uniformity in education, might I sug-
gest that they are welcoming manacles
to stop their hands from shaking.
N.S.W. Minister for Education, Mr. Cutler
The prospect of extending my 83
years to 123 by means of acquiring a
monkey’s heart or a hyena’s liver is full
of unpleasant possibilities.
Letter in the London “Times”
I refuse to believe that Britain can
only pay its way abroad on the basis
of arms shipments to South Africa.
British Prime Minister Wilson
I am not afraid of Queen Elizabeth.
She is a harmless, very kind, and very
sympathetic lady. But I am very much
afraid of that Genghis Khan of Peking.

where the next song’s coming from. I
don’t get any pleasure from heavily
dramatic parts. Nevertheless, basically
I’m an actor, and I suppose the things
I’m doing now are taking me a long
way from this.”
After months of the kind of financial
security television alone can provide
for an actor in this country, Livermore
is very sure about wanting a second
chance at it perhaps in a situation
comedy.
“But if I have another try at tele-
vision, I’d like to do what I call
comedy of character. For instance, I
think Frankie Howerd is very funny,
and Hancock, of course. They have the
talent for attaching importance to the
little things and minimising the big
things. Things are always slightly
awry in their sort of comedy.”
On the credit side, “I’m Alright
Now,” although severely panned, has
given Livermore a bigger public than
he reached in ten years of stage work,
knowledge of television production, and
the opportunity to see and sum up his
own image as a performer.
“That’s something I’ve never been
able to do before. Television gives you
the chance to see what actually is
happening to your face. I’ve noticed
mannerisms I wasn’t aware of before
and I’ve found I can laugh at myself
on the screen. Yes, I got mail during
the show—from young girls and old
girls. But the biggest kick I got was a
letter from a country bloke who said
he was grateful to the show because it
didn’t scream Australiana at him and
wasn’t parochial.”
Livermore put up the original idea
for “I’m Alright Now,” in which he
was projected into various fantasy situa-
tions involving his attraction to older
women. But a few months after the
series had begun production, he criti-
cised the turn the scripts were taking. “I
was feeling a bit low at that stage, and
I settled down afterwards. But I did
want it to be more outrageous in ‘The
Avengers’ sense. Less explicit, with
more way-out situations.
“The critics called me a narcissistic
performer. I know what they mean
and I’m not. But I know what made
them think I am. I think most of them
tuned into the show once or twice, saw
me playing this character called Reg
who keeps saying how irresistible he is
all the time and felt I meant it. If some
of them had watched more often and
become more involved with the charac-
ter, I think they’d have seen it differ-
ently.”
GLYNDEBOURNE IN THE BUSH
THERE IS now a splendid chance that
the Vincent Report on television, long,
because of the indifference of the Gov-
ernment, left mouldering in Canberra
without debate much less action, will
not be the only memorial to Senator
V. S. Vincent.
Perth actor, playwright, and folk-
singer John Joseph Jones and a group
of friends are almost literally with their
bare hands building a theatre in the
Darling Ranges, 22 miles from the city,
which is to be a memorial to Senator
Vincent. “He was a flame of a man,”
said Mr. Jones, “The Vincent Report
was to be his memorial; it became his
tombstone. But our theatre will be
dedicated to him.”
The theatre is making use of some
of the unique qualities Perth has over
other cities: its perfect Mediterranean
climate and its spirit of enterprise and
self-help.
The theatre is to be an outdoor one,
built in a natural amphitheatre, with a
creek and a pool, on a property owned
by Mr. Jones. It will live rent free,
which Mr. Jones knows by hard experi-
ence is essential for amateur or smaller
groups, particularly when dealing with
a new play or one which needs exten-
sive rehearsal. He has written three
plays. The season will be only the
summer months, so that no existing
theatre is likely to be robbed of audi-
ences.
The theatre will become a sort of
Glyndebourne in the bush. Mr. Jones
feels that the audience could arrive
some time in the afternoon to escape
the Perth heat, have a swim in the
pool, a barbecue or picnic, then settle
back for the evening performance.
Mr. Jones saw the amphitheatre and
its possibilities and then bought the
property on which it stood. The house
is now let, as Mr. Jones is working as
archivist at the Australian National
University, Canberra.
However, work on the theatre pro-
ceeds. At present the theatre commit-
tee and helpers are terracing the hill-
side which will form the auditorium,
to seat about 600, and setting in large
discs of red and white gums as flooring.
Seating will be aluminium armchairs,
which will be removed at the end of
the season.
Fifteen red gums will remain in the
auditorium, their branches forming a
canopy over the audience. Some black-
boys have been left growing, but Mr.
Jones says that members of the audi-
ence on the terrace behind will look
over the top of, and not through, these.
The theatre will have three stages,
the main one 70ft. wide, and, Mr.
Jones said, acoustics are perfect. So
far Mr. Jones and his committee have
not asked for any financial help. “But
I might have a talk to Tom Wardle
some time,” he said. It is hoped to
have the theatre ready in 18 months’
time. Firm intentions are Shakespeare
and Australian plays.
“Think of ‘A Midsummer Night’s
Dream’ at midnight,” said Mr. Jones.
“Think of how we could dramatise
‘Voss’ in this setting. But it will be
in every sense an experimental theatre,
and I believe that as nature has shaped
this theatre, so this theatre can shape
our drama. I believe we hurry too
much, expect too much too quickly.
Perhaps nothing much will come of our
theatre, but I am sure that something
will and that something will be a step
forward.”


BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
The ghost-of-
honor didn't make
the party
F’RANKLY, it is surprising there are
not a great many ghosts in Melbourne.
After all, this is a city in which a
vast number of bodies are buried, and
one can only presume that there must
be many very restless spirits abroad.
Our only regular ghost lives in the
Princess Theatre. This is an utterly
marvellous building. It could have been
designed by a consortium of artists,
which might have included Cruikshank,
Tenneil, Ronald Searle, and Charles
Addams. It is in the very best Vic-
toriana-Berserk style. It has the lot,
urns, stained-glass windows, balconies,
balustrades, little cast-iron cupolas,
muses all over the place, and an
utterly magnificent golden angel with
trumpet.
Actually, the architect was William
Pitt and he modelled his theatre on
Italy’s renowned Politaema. It opened
on December 18, 1886. The “Argus”
on December 20 said it was the
handsomest theatre south of the
Equator. Indeed, with its splendid
marble staircase and beautiful foyer,
the new Princess was the equal of the
Grand Opera in Paris, the Stadt
Theatre in Frankfurt, and the Grand
Theatre in Bordeaux, which contained
the finest approaches and foyers in
Europe. What’s more, our theatre had
a mechanical roof, which opened to
the stars, and grottoes, and waterfalls
on either side of the proscenium;
irresistible to ghosts.
Yes, Federici’s ghost has been the
only decent Melburnian ghost we have
been able to cling to, so to speak.
Why, Federici turned up even as
recently as July last year. June Bron-
hill told the “Australian” she saw
Federici at the back of the dress circle
during a performance of “Robert and
Elizabeth.”
“It was during the second act,” she
said. “During a dialogue scene I saw
this very pretty pink light, more a
pinpoint than anything. But it wasn’t
like any other light. I’m sure it was
Federici’s ghost.”
So, seeing that Federici is our only
permanent movable ghost game, it is
most satisfying to find that the whole
story is laid down in Frank Cusack’s
book “Australian Ghost Stories,” just
out.
Now, Federici was an English bari-
tone named Frederick Baker, who came
out here to play Mephistopheles in
“Faust.” The F. Federici bit was just an
idea to give him added style. Opening
night was March 3, 1888. The perform-
ance went very well, indeed; Mephi-
stopheles, as the agent of the devil,
had claimed his victim and was des-
cending the stage trap-door when he
collapsed and died. As the “Illustrated
Australian News” said at the time,
Mephistopheles, while descending with
Faust amid stage-fire and flames,
turned the mimic scene, by his own
death, into one of tragic reality.
Then the funeral was a very pain-
ful affair. The Reverend T. H. Good-
win, of the Church of England, who
exhibited great emotion, according to
the “Argus,” collapsed, fainted away,
and was unable to be revived for some
considerable time. This happened
just after he had finished the second
prayer and the coffin was being
lowered into the grave. “Mr. Charles
Warner, the well-known actor, had to
take up the reading.”
Gounod’s “Faust” had a very short
run at the Princess in 1888. Some
members of the cast claimed that
Federici had taken the curtain call
on the substitute’s first night and again
on subsequent nights.
But, as Frank Cusack points out,
the best authenticated stories of
Federici’s ghost have always had him
in evening dress. George Musgrove,
the theatre’s original producer, saw
him in evening dress at a late rehear-
sal. Federici was sitting in the front
row of an otherwise empty dress
circle.
“Give us another drink - I still can’t
see him!”
Miss Betty Beddoes, who worked the
greater part of her life at the theatre
as wardrobe mistress, saw the ghost
in 1917 during the season of Alan
Wilkie’s “School For Scandal.” She
was getting costumes ready for the
opening night when a fireman knocked
at the door and said: “Would you like
to see a ghost?” She and the fireman
saw a figure sitting quietly in the
second or third row of the dress circle.
Cusack writes: “The figure made no
movement and could be seen quite
plainly and appeared to be staring
straight ahead at the empty stage. It
was dressed in evening dress and gave
the impression of being well built
with either grey hair or a wig. The
face was in profile and not very dis-
tinct. Her most vivid recollection of
the occurrence, Miss Beddoes says, is
of the studs in the white shirtfront
which seemed in the half-light give
off a sort of glitter.
“The fireman asked her if she were
afraid. In a whispered reply she
assured him she wasn’t. Fascinated,
they watched it for some time during
which there was neither sound nor
movement . . . Miss Beddoes does not
pretend to be able to explain what
she saw. She cannot accept that it was
a case of ‘imagination playing tricks/
She prefers merely to recount what she
and another observed and leave it at
that.”
Soon after this incident Johr. Charles
Gange, a fireman, saw the figure in
evening dress standing in the centre of
the dress circle. He thought it was a
theatregoer who had found himself
locked in. Gange called out to him.
The figure didn’t answer, and, slowly,
it began to fade and disappear.
Altogether, according to Cusack, there
have been nearly 30 authenticated
sightings of our ghost and at one stage
the management offered £lOO to any-
one who would spend a night alone at
the Princess.. There is no record that
the reward was ever claimed.
Heinemann’s had a late-night book
launching of Cusack’s book right there
in the theatre. They played the last act
of Gounod’s “Faust,” and tried to get
everything as it was on March 3, 1888.
They had dim lights and even used
dry ice to provide ghostly vapors on
the stage.
Everything was done to encourage
Federici’s appearance. Miss Betty Bed-
does, now in her late 80s, was there.
So, too, was Mrs. Garnet Carrbll, who
saw Federici in a dark cloak one night
during a ballet rehearsal.
Special cocktails, invented just for
the evening, were served. For example,
there was the Mephistopheles Cocktail,
which was devil-red and consisted of
cherry vodka, Polish pure spirit, and
pineapple juice. Then there was “The
Spectre” . . . Polish pure spirit,
loz. Zubrowka Bison vodka, and lemon
juice.
However, by 1.30 a.m. Federici had
failed to appear. Undoubtedly it was
the cocktails. No respectable devil
would be seen drinking them.

Capturing an
ineffable moment
in a pie's career
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
OK, CHAPS. O-ver the pack . . .
th -rough the flowers . . . and on to the
pie. That glorious, succulent apple pie,
which is actually rice-filled to capacity
for better shape and painted with gela-
tine to make it shine, shine, shine like
Mother’s never could, because on top
of all that it is fixed with hair lacquer.
Everyone’s mesmerised by this pseudo
apple pie, hours later to be replaced
by three baked rolls, sultana, ginger,
and some other flavor that no one can
remember, followed by two lemon mer-
ingue pies hepped up with vinegar and
cornflour; one for cutting into, the other
for leaving whole.
What’s going on is the filming of
Betty Sydney’s cake-mix commercial,
the last of an action-packed dramatic
series which is highly secret and guar-
anteed to throw their chief competitor,
old White Wings, into a frenzy. This
won’t happen until March, unless some-
one spills the beans, and according to
Ron Kain, the advertising agency chief,
this is highly unlikely.
Mr. Kain used to think everyone who
came near the studio a potential spy,
he got into a terrible state about it, but
now he is more philosophical. Well,
nothing’s leaked out yet, and he trusts
this column implicitly. Don’t they all?
“And I can tell you this,” says producer
Donald Wynne, looming out of the
shadows looking awfully Sam Spiegel in
green shot-silk shirt, blue jeans, and
beige canvas chukka boots, it’s all a bit
hot for him, “that you can ask any one
of these fellahs at the end of the day
what they’ve filmed and they couldn’t
tell you.” In London, Mr. Wynne told
clients it’s no use swearing ’em to sec-
recy, you’ll draw their attention to the
product. Let ’em alone and they’ll not
even notice.
They’ve all been here since 8.30 this
morning. On the far side of the studio,
Jan, the home economist, lets out a
yawn. Sue, the secretary in red-white-
and-blue knitted, mini-yawns, too, and
they fall into a magazine. In the corner,
Jock, the props, writes out his Christ-
mas card list. The only man physically
working, slaving, in fact, is Frank,


known in the film trade as Grips.
“Come on, bring her up a bit,” shouts
Gary, sitting in comfort on the mobile
camera, and Grips, in tight red tartan
shorts, pumps frenziedly to oblige.
“We’re rolling, we’re rolling, one—two
—three action,” yells Donald Wynne.
Too long. Again. We’re rolling, we’re
rolling, we’re rolling Grips is not
hmmmmmmmmmm, grumbles Gary.
Grips says it’s not his fault it won’t
hmmmmmmmmmm. Once more. One-
two-three track. Cut. The camera drips
and rolls, for heaven’s sake. Can’t
Grips anticipate it? Again. One-two-
three, dolly, ready cut. That’s the
pie done. Can Mr. Wynne have a slice,
please, darling?
Jan has it ready. Ardmona’s instant
tinned apple mashed up and tucked
into Betty Sydney’s instant crust. She
paints on gelatine for extra shine.
“Um—er—l may be wrong, of course,”
says Mr. Wynne, “but don’t you think
that pie crust looks a bit dull?” More
gelatine. He holds it on a server while
Gary zooms in one —two —three, takes
and zooms out. Women are incapable
of holding, they get the shakes. Mr.
Wynne can only hold if he stops talk-
ing.
Jan is surrounded by rollmix, pre-
baked to a bricklike stale state, skewers
to scratch their surface, cans of hair-
spray, gelatine, rubbery meringue fill-
ings. She hates doing meringues, they
run by the time everything’s set up, and
this session is not going very quickly.
Mr. Kain has bad news for her. The
chocolate-cake session has to be reshot.
It’s gotta jinx on it, says Jan, they
should forget it. You mean not do it?
asks Mr. Kain, aghast. Jan says she
means forget it.
Actually, Jan is a key girl. No one
spreads butter like her, no one cuts
slices like her. No one is allowed to. In
her white overall she flits from the
Metters oven, it’s been there nine
months and Jock’s sending them whisky
for Chrissie, to camera with her glitter-
ing food. Mr. Wynne stares in agony at
the meringue pie, twists his lips, turns
his head to one side. “I don’t know,
Jan, I may be wrong, I could be wrong,
the crust looks a bit dry, don’t you
think?” Without a word she puts on
gelatine. Oh, they should hurry. The
meringue’s going funny. Mr. Wynne
says he hasn’t lost a pie in years. “Only
cheesecake, Donald.” What’s that?
“You dropped it.”
They’ve been at it four hours now.
Sue’s made-up hand holds a sultana roll
in the air, put it down with determina-
tion, darling, you know, meaningly.
Butter cannot be found. Jock cannot be
found. Steal darling "Lil’s butter, some-
one. Betty Sydney himself arrives, he
doesn’t interfere like some in this busi-
ness. When Gary and Mr. Wynne help
themselves to a slice of meringue, with
vinegar, cornflour, gelatine, lacquer, and
all, and say it’s gorgeous, he actually
says thank you.

—And a
very unedifying
New Year
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
WHAT A new face courage puts on
everything!
Emerson
That dismal platitude met my eyes
when I looked at my desk calendar
on Monday, June 5, this year. Ralph
Waldo Emerson is a great standby
of the desk-calendar people. He wrote
habitually in desk calendarese al-
ways inspiring, always trite. Under his
influence, on that glum Monday
morning, I resolved to collect quota-

The consequences
of John McEwen
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
SIR ROBERT MENZIES, a man who
knows -his Australian political history,
must be wondering agonisingly
whether Counti-y Party Leader John
McEwen is doing to the Liberal Party,
which Menzies created and kept in
office for 17 years, what an earlier
Country Leader Sir Earle Page did first
to the old Nationalist Party and then
to the United Australian Party.
The words of the Labor Leader in
the Senate in 1926, Albert Gardiner,
may well yet prove an appropriate
epitaph for the Liberal Party of 1967.
Said Gardiner, after the Country
Party insisted that they would not
serve in a Coalition Government under
William Morris Hughes, the National-
ists were rendered “unfit for further
service as His Majesty’s Government
though possibly useful as attendants on
the Sultan of Turkey.”
I have no reason to believe that
Sir Robert Menzies would have done
other than watch the present Liberal
moves to elect a successor as Liberal
Leader to the late Mr. Holt with other
than benevolent interest in normal cir-
cumstances.
But circumstances are not normal.
The Prime Minister, Mr. John
McEwen, in his role as CP Leader has
flung down a challenge. If the Liberal
Party elects its Deputy Leader, Mr.
William McMahon, to the top, then
McEwen will not serve in a Coalition
Government. He will attempt to lead
his Party without defections he
hopes out of the Government Party
room and on to the cross benches.
The situation has an uncanny historic
resemblance to that of 1939, which led
to the elimination of the UAP as a
political force in Australia.
The Prime Minister, Mr. J. A. Lyons,
who led the UAP, had died. The
then Leader of the Country Party, Sir
Earle Page, who functioned as Deputy
Prime Minister, was given a commission
to form a Government. The UAP had
to meet to elect a new Leader.
Page did not want as UAP Leader
Sir Robert (then Mr.) Menzies. After
Menzies was elected as UAP Leader,
Page led his followers out of the Gov-
ernment and on to the cross benches.
Not all the CP men followed him.
There were four defectors, including
Sir Arthur (then Mr.) Fadden, who
later himself rose to be CP Leader
and served for years in a Menzies’
administration as Treasurer.
An ironical twist now in 1967 is that
the Government was convinced that
there would be a minimum of four CP
defectors if, when Mr. Holt confronted
and repudiated McEwen for his pro-
devaluation views, McEwen turned
stubborn and produced a split in the
Coalition. With their own following of
60, the Liberals believed they could
command a sufficient majority.
Probably the same four would be
potential defectors if the Liberals elect
McMahon as leader, which adds an
element of gamble to McEwen’s present
move against McMahon.
If McMahon cannot win, he is
almost certainly finished as a force
in Federal politics. But if he does
win, it could be McEwen who is mov-
ing toward the end of his period of
power.
The CP was not happy when Page
led the CP on to the cross benches in
1939. They did not enjoy being in
the political limbo. They deposed Sir
Earle Page from CP Leader and were
led back—joyously—into the Coalition
by his successor, the late Archie Cam-
eron.
If the Liberals take the 1923 line
and dump McMahon as the Nation-
alists then dumped Hughes, the position
will be rather ironic. It is possible
that without McEwen’s interference
McMahon might have been beaten
anyway. But now McEwen has in-
tervened, he and the CP will un-
doubtedly get the credit for having
beaten him.
The Liberals are jammed, in a sense.
If they do not elect McMahon they
have created a situation where on any
major issue the CP will believe that
it has only to threaten to break the
Coalition to get its way.
Mr. Holt would not bow to the
threat, even though it was implicit in
McEwen’s attack upon the Govern-
ment for its decision not to devalue the
Australian dollar. He put his Govern-
ment and the Coalition on the
line when he told McEwen face to
face that he was going to repudiate
him on his devaluation statement, and
then went on and repudiated him.
But a new Liberal Prime Minister
would not be in the same position
of strength as Mr. Holt, particularly
if his followers had bowed to McEwen’s
insistence that they could not have
McMahon as Leader.
The situation that followed 1923,
and which Gardiner described so
graphically, would probably then be
repeated. The Liberals would be
regarded as eunuchs, impotent attend-
ants upon the real rulers the
Country Party. After Hughes was
deposed, Page became the real force
within the Australian Government.
McEwen would undoubtedly loom far
larger than he has to the present.
Personally, I regard McEwen as one
of the most able, astute, and dedicated
individuals who have passed through
the Federal Parliament in the years I
have been reporting the national scene.
He has a perceptive political mind,
which, in my view, he has tended to
use increasingly over the past two
years. This has been due to his
mounting disillusion with the Coali-
tion (or at least the Liberal section
that he genuinely believes has been
working against the interests of the
Country Party).
I do not know what the effect of
McEwen’s statement will be upon the
Liberal Parliamentarians, who on
January 9 will vote on who should be
their new Leader. The first reaction
of many of them undoubtedly was
“the Coalition must be preserved
McMahon’s out.” But as they study
the history of 1923 and 1939 and the
Country Party action which led to
the political liquidation of the National
Party and United Australia Party,
there must be uneasiness.
I was rather amused by ministerial
complaints that in the way I was
reporting what was happening I was
making it difficult for the Liberals to
elect somebody other than McMahon
without being exposed to the charge
that they were yielding to McEwen
abjectly and spiritlessly. I am afraid
that to one of them I said that this
was the type of YMCA political think-
ing that was eroding the authority and
assuredness of the Liberal Party. It
was not I or any of my colleagues
who were jamming the Liberals into
this position. It was Mr. McEwen.
As I saw it, his recent statement
on devaluation put him out of calcu-
lation as a Prime Minister, even in the
unlikely event of satisfactory arrange-
ments between the Coalition partners.
He clearly showed in his statement
that he favored devaluation of the
Australian dollar. If he was formally
appointed to the major Australian
point of power the Prime Minis-
ter’s seat every shrewd currency
operator in the world would be smell-
ing an Australian dollar devaluation.
McEwen apparently accepts this.
When questioned at his first Prime
Ministerial Press conference about the
proposal by Senator Turnbull from
Tasmania that he should take over
the Prime Ministership permanently,
McEwen said he was not responsible
for Senator Turnbull’s thoughts.
Given what happened in 1923 and
more particularly in 1939, if McMahon
is not elected, you might be able to
settle down and study the disintegra-
tion of an administration that has en-
dured for 18 years.
However, in 1923 and 1939 the
Labor Party was not also disintegrating,
as it now is. Mr. Arthur Calwell is
coming back to Australia on January 2
with a firm intention. This is to make
clear Labor’s- policy on Vietnam—the
issue that cost Labor so dear at the
last Federal elections and which Mr.
Whitlam successfully evaded during the
recent Seriate elections. The Victorian
ALP executive has set up a testimonial
dinner for Calwell. He is being given


a forum. He can now raise a row in
the Labor Party, the echoes of which
would continue - to Whitlam’s dis-
advantage—right until the next elec-
tions.
But the noise that Calwell makes
could quite easily be lost in the larger
uproar in the ranks of government.
Whitlam can probably afford to take
the trip he proposed for South-East
Asia during the parliamentary recess
with an easy feeling. He does not have
to stay at home to do any work. It is
being done for him. By his political
opponents.
The DLP is the unknown quantity. I
may be misjudging the situation but
it is possible that, if the Liberals go
ahead and elect McMahon, McMahon
could be in a stronger position than
Menzies was nearly 30 years ago. If the
DLP stuck with him and I could
not see them taking the risk of a
Labor Government coming to power
until the present Left-Wing control of
the ALP machine is broken he would
have a better chance of surviving than
Menzies had. (For that matter, even
though his position was weaker, Men-
zies survived in 1940. He was brought
down only when dissension broke out in
his own ranks.) In such circumstances,
the Country Party would have to reject
McEwen and elect a leader who would
serve under McMahon unless they
were to continue to exist impotently,
except in unusual circumstances, as a
corner Party.
The making
of a Prime Minister
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
MR. HOLT created better than he
could ever know. That so many
foreign Governments announced that
they would fly their own senior states-
men to Australia, and that so many
of them were Asian Governments, and
that the first to announce his decision
was the President of the United States,
were all matters that stood first to
Mr. Holt’s honor, and then to Aus-
tralia’s. It was Australian policy and
the blood of Australian servicemen that
earned American interest: but it was
Mr. Holt himself who earned Presi-
dent Johnson. With some other Prime
Minister the best we would have got
would have been the Vice-President.
When the new Prime Minister takes
over in a fortnight’s time he should
ponder very thoroughly the lessons of
the honors paid to Mr. Holt by
foreign political leaders. They tell
one a lot about Australia’s role in the
world and they point the trail for a
new Prime Minister. The lessons have
already been explained by a great deal
of world comment, which sees in them
a dramatisation of Australia’s new
self-definition as a Pacific and Asian
power, looking across the Pacific to
America and Japan, and finding a new
sense of importance for itself closer at
home in the affairs of South-East Asia.
And as an unfortunate footnote there
is the story of the British Government’s
slowness in response: the announce-
ment that Mr. Wilson would fly to
Australia came eleventh on the list,
after the announcement that the Lao-
tian Minister for Finance would come.
Would Mr. Wilson have entered the
list at all if President Johnson had not
already made his announcement?
The new Prime Minister should also
ponder the fact that Australian praise
for Mr. Holt has almost overwhelm-
ingly concentrated on his activities in
foreign countries, and in particular in
the attempt to turn himself into a
symbol of Australian interest in the
countries of Asia. It was with these
particular obsessions that Mr. Holt
most caught the imagination of Aus-
tralians. Any man who accepts the
Prime Ministership without a readiness
to continue this part of Mr. Holt’s
work will not only be doing his coun-
try a disservice: he may be finishing
himself off as a political leader and
the Liberal Party as a political force,
What was in some ways most pleas-
ing about the list of those who an-
nounced that they were coming was
that it included not only Asian leaders
vvho saw Australia as their ally in Viet-
nam but also some of those who were
not committed on Vietnam, or even
opposed American and Australian
policy there. Of these, the most not-
able was the Vice Premier of Cambodia,
There was a real friendship between
the Australian and. Cambodian Govern-
ments, despite theh differences on Viet-
nam; then, for other reasons, there was
a breach. But despite this breach the
Cambodians were represented. For the
Vice Premier of Cambodia and the
President of Vietnam to attend the
same ceremony was indeed an achieve-
ment.
There was a lesson here, too, for the
next Prime Minister. Australia’s defini-
tion of its role in the Pacific and in
South-East Asia must not appear a
mere matter of emergency and expedi-
ence. It must not appear to be nothing
more than a commitment to America,
It must also appear to be a declaration
of permanent interest in our own
neighborhood and of the readiness to
assume a genuine and lasting neigh-
borly role. That Mr. Holt himself was
aware of this was obvious enough, but
beyond visits to some of the non-
committed States and given the strange
omission of a visit to Indonesia, he had
not got around to a meaningful defini-
tion of new policy.
The central problems of Australian
foreign policy are now right on our
own doorstep: are we going to use our
comparatively great wealth to play a
defined and vigorous role among our
immediate neighbors? Or are we,
through lack of imagination and drive,
or out of sheer brainlessness, just going
to drift out of the area? This is the
single most important question for the
new Prime Minister to consider.
To consider it effectively he must be
someone who knows how to handle the
Treasury and stand up to the Depart-
ment of Trade. He must be able to
produce more flexible in
economic - assistance schemes and a
more flexible use of trading policy as
a form of economic assistance. He must
also be prepared to pick and support
a Minister for Defence who can give
an impetus to greater rationalisation
of defence planning so that we get
more for our money. He must also be
prepared to increase the amount of
money we spend so that, as our pros-
perity grows, we spend a bit more of
it in the general support of our foreign
policy.
He may, in particular, have to be
someone who can distinguish between
helping farmers to get out of now-
inefficient farming and paying farmers
to remain inefficient. Much of the
money that goes into our big bill for
support of the primary industries should
finally go somewhere else. What better
way for it to go than in strengthening
Australia’s general position in its own
neighborhood and in making it a more
honorable one? Some Australian far-
mers have their problems, but tens of
thousands of farmers in Indonesia
cannot even grow themselves enough
to eat.
To speak in this way of what the
new Prime Minister should be and
should do might seem disheartening.
When one looks at a Cabinet full of
Ministers it is not unusual that none
of them should look as if he would
be any good as Prime Minister. But
this ignores the lesson of Mr. Holt
himself: who would have expected,
when Mr. Holt took over, that the
praise most often repeated in his
obituaries would be for his interest
in Australia’s relations with countries
in Asia? New office makes men or
breaks them. You can’t really know
how a man will exercise new powers
until he begins to exercise them.
In the meantime the fact that there
is dispute as to whom the next Prime
Minister should be is not to anyone’s
discredit. The issues involved roll up
into the central political issue of the
day: who will serve Australia best?
And the power struggle that is going
on, the bluffs and the calling of bluffs,
are not just the outcome of passing
personal squabbles but and this
applies particularly to the role of the
Country Party they are also a way
of settling in advance matters that later
will come out more politely defined as
matters of policy.


AUSTRALIA What’s coming up in 1968?
Does Australia have a
policy of “forward defence”?
BEFORE THE SHOCK of the
tragedy of Portsea has worn off, the
Government parties have been thrown
into thinking about 1968 with an
urgency that could not previously have
been imagined.
The new Ministry will have a range
of urgent domestic and foreign policy
problems, most of which have to be
resolved in the first four months of
the year. The Government had hoped
to get most important devaluation-
assistance decisions made this year, but
now they will be carried over.
Mr. Holt was talking just before
his death in terms of the need to
“restructure” dairying < and a number
of other rural industries affected not
only by sterling’s devaluation but a
wide range of adverse trends in inter-
national trade. Such talk is anathema
to most Country Party politicians, but
Liberals have at long last started to
face the fact that it is impossible to
go on forever as a matter of political
convenience, multiplying subsidies and
handouts. It is true that a number of
Country Party people are also com-
ing to appreciate the need for ration-
alisation. Compromise will nevertheless
be difficult to reach.
Another coalition problem which
cannot be staved off any longer is
electoral redistribution. Legal advisers
to the Government say that the 1969
election results could easily be found
unconstitutional unless the present
obsolete 1954 electoral map is redrawn.
For their part, electoral-office men are
getting very impatient for the process
to be put in train. The sheer mechani-
cal work of compiling new electoral
rolls and printing new maps and lists,
and then producing ballot papers is
going to take all of 1969. In order to
get the necessary legislation passed this
year, a Cabinet decision will have to be
made first thing in 1968. The problem
is politically difficult, of course, be-
cause it is almost certain to mean the
loss of a Country Party seat in N.S.W.
But the real test of the vision and
leadership of the new Government will
undoubtedly come in the field of
defence and foreign policy. June 30
sees the completion of the modest
defence build-up set in train by Sir
Robert Menzies on a three-year plan
announced in October, 1964. The new
Government has to quickly get around
to laying down the defence guidelines
for the next three years. But these
guidelines depend on how strategic and
foreign policy shape up.
It is becoming increasingly difficult
to continue to maintain traditional
views of “forward defence” as the key
theme in defence thinking. With the
British no longer a reliable force in this
part of the world, Australia is faced
with a clearcut choice. On the one
hand there is the possibility, after
Vietnam, of withdrawing from Asia, in
the sense of backing out of treaty com-
mitments and pulling back the small
remaining military commitment. On
the other hand, there is the possibility
of sticking to a different kind of for-
ward defence an attempt to use our
military potential in harmony with that
of friendly countries in the region to
keep those countries in friendly hands.
With the British gone, and the
Americans unlikely ever again to
assume such large unilateral commit-
ments, it is no longer possible for Aus-
tralia to make forward defence work by
simply providing token contributions of
troops in support of major allies. An
army which can only sustain three
battalions of troops in action overseas
is simply not large enough to make the
weight required to sustain forward
defence in the new strategic situation.
And there are other problems to be
resolved in the Malaysia-Singapore de-
fence region. How do we reach an
arrangement with these countries satis-
factory also to Indonesia? Should we
apply to join ASEAN, the latest and
most promising approach to regional
co-operation in the area?
The Government has, in essence, to
decide whether to spend more on the
Army, planning to, say, double it over
a period of five years or so by continu-
ing the build-up of 1964 or else to
eschew alliances with our Asian neigh-
bors and adopt a policy of non-
involvement. The Government’s ad-
visers are insistent that it would be
foolish to get seriously involved in
treaty commitments with Malaysia-
Singapore without a substantial expan-
sion of the Army.
The new Prime Minister is likely to
be involved in two international con-
ferences early in 1968. The first is
Tunku Abdul Rahman’s Malaysia-
U.K. - Australia - N.Z. - Singapore
talks on how to fill the British gap:
the second a meeting on Vietnam
allies in Seoul. Discussions at these
Tunku Abdul Rahman . . . decisive
conference?
conferences may possibly have some
effect on Australian decision-making. It
is possible that the Tungku’s conference
may be decisive.
On the domestic front a number of
other matters are likely to present
problems. Inflation, already at an un-
healthy high annual rate of between
four and five percent in recent quarters,
will be given a further boost by the
generous Metal Trades award. Fur-
ther “work value” awards on top of
the normal national wage case, plus
the pressure of growing consumer
spending, could push the rate of price
increase up to really worrying levels.
And if, additionally, the Government
is committed to a continuation of the
defence build-up and an expensive pro-
gram for restructuring devaluation-hit
rural industries, it could have an un-
usually nasty budgetary problem. There
simply must be a rise in Social Ser-
vice payments after two barren years,
and with elections nearing. Common-
wealth-State relations remain a per-
petual problem. For the moment the
issue there is Mr. Bolte’s receipts-tax
proposal. The- Commonwealth has the
constitutional power to prevent his
going ahead with it, but the political
consequences would be unfavorable.
After all, the Commonwealth has
always replied to State requests for
more money with the suggestion that
the States raise more themselves.
New initiatives in education and
integration of parts of the Services are
other projects the Government is com-
mitted to. All in all, the troubles'
likely to be piled on the Prime Minis-
terial plate in the coming year might
deter all but the most eager aspirants
and cause some of the less-impatient
to decide to wait for another, better
time.


The Australians
Viewed State-wise
THE TRUISM IS that all Australians
are much the same wherever they live
in Australia, that they speak the same
language, and have very similar
thoughts and aspirations in the occas-
ional winter snows of Hobart or the
sweaty monsoonal weather of the north-
ern “wet.” But if a standard template
was applied each year to the Austra-
lians of Perth or Melbourne or Bris-
bane, some variations might be visible.
This year, for instance, Western Aus-
tralians would show up bigger and
prouder, speaking confidently about the
mineral wealth which has changed their
State from a poor relation to one with
a “magnificent future.” The ore car-
riers commute to and from Japan; oil
flows, if not much natural gas; the
off-shore fishing industry grows, how-
ever; the Feds have formally acknow-
ledged the new state of affairs by grant-
ing money for the Old River scheme’s
Stage Two; and “Tom the Cheap”
Wardle is Lord Mayor of the new,
about-to-swing Perth. Even the weather
smiled, and the West escaped the worst
of the drought. No opera house, of
course, but there is talk of a cultural
centre to house the Perth Festivals.
The South Australian might fit the
template exactly, and without being
surprised. The introductions of lotteries,
TAB, and sensible drinking hours have
not made him more raffish, nor does
he see natural gas and a couple of other
mineral discoveries as more than
brightly promising. Drought, salt in
the Murray waters, halting of the
Chowilla Dam project, not a good year
for farmers. If pro-Dunstan Govern-
ment, he will have some social changes
to look back on and forward to. If not,
nothing too drastic has been done. And
1968 is a Festival year in South Austra-
lia; culture, admiring tourists, and their
money the jackpot.
Many of the visitors will come from
Victoria, refugees from the 1968
Moomba. And these will relate
strangely to the standard, contracting
and expanding alternately, according to
the political weather. Victorian Premier
Bolte’s whoops over natural gas and
other Victorian wonders are wildly ex-
pansive; but the Labor Left-wing’s
blasts are icy and cause immediate con-
traction of the image. Melbourne’s cul-
tural centre will be open long before
anyone else’s . . . but after that, the
Melbourne Cup is a long time off.
Melbourne’s proud gardens grow less
green under a record drought and
dowsings of Yarra water. Nature has
withered the Wimmera wheat and the
Government hopes to cut back the lush
parasitical growths in some areas of
Victorian company affairs.
Tasmanians, even on weighted esti-
mates which allow for their natural
disadvantages, come smaller this year.
Everything’s gone wrong and it has been
hell for them. An amazing drought
caught the Hydro Commission with its
dams down, just as new industry was
beginning to move in. Hurriedly re-
casting its plans for the future, it
made the conservationists cry “Des-
poliation.” Emergency plant had to
be found to pump kilowatts into the
system to keep Tasmania’s lights burn-
ing. Egypt’s Nasser blocked the Suez
Canal and trapped Tasmania’s frozen-
fruit exports. A year to shrink anyone.
Australians living in New South
Wales lost a year somewhere, or that’s
what it felt like. Premier Askin’s elec-
tion promises were 95 percent ful-
filled, but without causing a ripple in
the tide of events. The most excite-
ment of the year was Princess Soraya’s
visit, which speaks for itself. Someone
was rumored to have struck natural
gas out near Bourke. No, nothing
happened in N.S.W. this year and the
future looks as drab.
And how is the Australian in “the
State bigger than Texas”? Actually,
he has been keeping quiet about it
this year. He feels that his State
must be filled with mineral goodies
just under the surface somewhere; a
wishful thought born of fear that
Western Australia is going to leap up
the ladder and hang on there. And
Western Australia is not only bigger
than Texas but all Queensland, too.
Of course, tourists bring Queensland
great wealth but it is so widely
disseminated as to appear invisible.
“We have the most tourists,” sounds
feeble; and many are known to prefer
Alice Springs, for some inexplicable
reason. Queenslanders fit the template
as snugly as South Australians, and as
two-dimensionally as New South
Welshmen.
But, as anything can happen in Aus-
tralia, some of these sectional images
may have changed radically by next
Christmas; and perhaps even the tem-
plate may have to be altered, after
consultation with the latest computers
—and who knows, by then some marvel
may have so enlivened the Australian
electronics industry that even those
could be Australian-made.
The economy
Tariff troubles
ALTHOUGH 1967 BEGAN with the
whimper of a familiar dispute over
Commonwealth-State financial grants it
ended with the bang of a sterling de-
valuation.
Unemployment in January was
slightly on the high side. Industrial
production was flat. Consumer spend-
ing was dull. Unemployment, industrial
production, and consumer spending all
remained the way they started through-
out most of the year, but following the
Budget things began to pick up and the-
economy generally is now moving more
healthily. The exceptions are the rural
areas in western Victoria, N.S.W., and
South Australia that have been badly
hit by drought. In addition, business
spending on plant and equipment is
down. But generally Treasurer Mc-
Mahon and his advisers deserve high
marks for their management of the
economy this year.
A lot of economic policy is, of course,
made outside the Government proper
by semi-independent agencies. Wages
policies, for instance, are made by the
Arbitration Commission. Nineteen-
sixty-seven was the first year of the
new total wage system of fixation,
in which the Commission sets
minimum wages for various categories,
thus finally abandoning the basic wage.
Its award of a $1 rise was not by itself
beyond the capacity of the economy to
absorb, but on top of the continuing
effects of the previous year’s $2 and an
interim margins increase of $l.lO it
undoubtedly was a major factor in the
inflation which developed through the
year. More ominous from this view-
point was the December decision in the
metal trades “work value” case, in
which an average 16 percent increase in
wages was granted. There is no auto-
matic “flow on” to other industries, the
Commission said, but it will be sur-
prising if, when the Commission comes
to examine these others, it fails to find
similar reasons for similar sorts of rises.
The present way in which our wages
policy is made is real seat-of-the-pants
Government, with the Arbitration Com-
mission having only the vaguest ideas
about what it is doing, and evidently
without any clear criteria to guide it.
Despite lengthy hearings, and months
of evidence, in neither of this year’s
two most important cases was the Com-
Premier Bolte . . . expansive
Victorian } with tax problems


mission able to give a single clue as to
why it had granted the amounts it
seized on. One Commissioner in the
“work value” case said the rises being
given w'ere gargantuan. Another said
more w'ould have been granted had
more been asked for. None explained
how or why they gave what they gave.
AVith a whole series of further import-
ant cases coming up, the Commission
looms as a major source of economic
instability in 1968.
Looked at another way, the year end-
ing deserves to be called the year of
tariffs. For one thing, Mr. McEwen
w'ent off to Geneva wfith most of the
Trade Department’s remaining top
brass (there have been a large number
of resignations from the Department),
and on behalf of Australia participated
in the historic Kennedy Round of
tariff cuts. We participated mainly by
selling off British preferences in our
tariff structure rather than by cutting
our tariffs. We gave little and we got
little, despite a lot of initial prompting
and self-congratulations. We managed
to get a marginally better access to the
tight Japanese and European markets
for meat and an internal grains agree-
ment granting useful minimum prices
for wheat.
Domestic discussion of tariff policy
reached a new peak and the Tariff
Board itself came through with a bold
new approach to this important area
of industrial development. In its re-
port it formulated for the first time
a policy unless the previous system
of doling out any old amount of pro-
duction to any old firm which came
along or which made generous contri-
butions to party funds could be called
policy. The Board announced that in
future very high productive needs
would be taken as prima jade evidence
of the uneconomic future of an in-
dustry. Such excessive production would
be examined more frequently in future
and protection wmuld be continued only
if special reasons could be produced
for doing so. Contrarily, industries
operating on low tariffs could be
assumed to be highly economic and
should be allowed to expand with their
natural competitive strength. The policy
would, over a period of years, mean
a simplification of widely varying levels
of tariff production, a halt to the ex-
pansion of high cost, uneconomic in-
dustries, and greater certainty for in-
dustrialists.
It was a year, too, of rising defence
equipment costs, wfith the Fill being-
labelled the flying Opera House and
Defence Minister Fairhall making the
year’s most singular contribution to
economic theory when he said about
the Fill that “Australia would be get-
ting its money’s worth, whatever the
cost.” The production of at least one
Government agency increased that
of the Bureau of Census and Statistics.
Census results in 1966 were churned
out of the Bureau’s bank of computers,
providing a mass of books of basic
statistical data about the Australian
population. Of greater immediate value
was a wide range of seasonally adjusted
statistics of immense value to analysts
of the economy.
If the year started on the mundane
question of Commonwealth-State fin-
ances the same subject w r as being held
over for 1968. At the beginning of 1967
the Commonwealth knocked back Vic-
torian Premier Bolte’s State income-
tax proposals but promised a full-
scale review of Federal financial rela-
tions. It forgot about it in the course
of the year and finished up having Mr.
Bolte challenging Canberra again
with another scheme, a comprehensive
rates tax which would have threatened
even the Prime Minister’s salary, since
he was a Victorian.
Schools
A staggering idea
IF A BENEFIT-COST approach was
taken to the Australian school system,
the prize for the most constructive
suggestion of the year should go to
Jeanette Cockburn for her article in
the April issue of the South Australian
“Teachers’ Journal.” In essence her sug-
gestion is that secondary schools should
operate in two separate but overlap-
ping shifts, one starting at 8 a.m. and
finishing at 3 p.m., and the other start-
ing at 11 a.m. and ending at 6 p.m.
The article claims that by housing
two groups of students in one existing
building with one set of facilities in
nse at different times, both capital and
operating costs would be reduced and
class sizes could be smaller. The
corollary suggestion is that three kinds
of teachers be employed: full-time
academic, part-time academic, and
part-time elective. Elective subjects
would be taken between 11 a.m. and
3 p.m. and thus tap the strong potential
market of qualified married women
and university students seeking part-
time w'ork.
With State Governments spending
more than a third of their annual
incomes on education and the Com-
monwealth increasing its schools expen-
diture each year, the shift schedule has
a lot to recommend it. Schools and
their equipment are only used for 35
hours out of a weekly 128 hours, which
in economic terms represents a heavy
capital wastage. The school timetable
is a barrier to the employment of fully
qualified or potentially competent mar-
ried women who could do a great deal
to ease the national teacher shortage.
Education authorities in Australia
are so characteristically wary of experi-
ment that it may be some time before
the shift scheme is tried, though some
South Australian and Victorian officials
are willing to try it out in a few
schools. And there are some signs that
winds of change are beginning to blow r
through the corridors of Education
Departments. In 1966, for example,
Victoria’s Sir Henry Bolte was telling
that State’s secondary teachers that
Education Minister Thompson . . .
peace to classrooms
they could “strike until Doomsday”
but his Government would not grant
them representation on the Teachers’
Tribunal.
The new Education Minister, Mr.
Lindsay Thompson, introduced legis-
lation to create a new Tribunal on
which primary, secondary, and techni-
cal teachers w'ould be separately repre-
sented in matters dealing with their
interests thus removing the cause
of discontent which had resulted in
three teachers’ strikes. The Tribunal’s
recent decision to phase in equal pay
for women teachers has removed the
other serious source of trouble in the
State.
Whilst 1968 should bring peace to
Victoria’s staff rooms, there are signs
of friction emerging in Queensland,
where a half-day strike was organised
by a group of teachers in defiance of
an official union directive. The teach-
ers who organised the stoppage are
backing the militant Mr. Ted Bald-
win for the Queensland Teachers’
Union presidential election, which wall
be held in May. If they wdn, the
Queensland Education Department can
expect further stoppages.
The influence of the Left Wing has
increased in teachers’ unions in Vic-
toria and Queensland, but the situation
is more doubtful in New South Wales,
where the former Communist president
of the N.S.W. Teachers’ Federation
has stepped down after 40 years on
the Federation’s council.
The most contentious issue to emerge
late in the year has been the attack
on examinations by teachers, head-
masters, administrators, and academics.
As a result a pilot scheme w r ill be
introduced in Victoria in which a
select group of schools will set their
own syllabuses and mark their own
students for the Leaving Certificate.
The scheme will almost certainly be
carried over into matriculation and
extended to other approved schools.
Tasmania is also to experiment wfith


a similar scheme. In both States the
attempt is being made to work out
a satisfactory replacement for the
terror of the annual examination.
South Australia has promised the
most remarkable advance of all
secondary education designed to
encourage children to think for them-
selves from their first year in high
school, learn how to acquire the know-
ledge they needed, and to express
themselves in lucid and confident
speech. This education for living as
well as for a job might help students
in their tertiary years, when many lose
confidence and become aimless in an
unfamiliar discipline.
Perhaps 1968 holds more promise
for pupils than for their masters.
Aborigines
Plodding backward
DO THE ABORIGINES want to be
assimilated, as official all-Governments
policy says they should? No one has
asked them, and no one is likely to.
There is no apparatus for it, not even
one trained social scientist running a
pilot survey. A few months after this
year’s referendum by which Australians
handed to the Commonwealth power
to make laws for the Aborigines, and
weeks after it has made the gesture
of handling titular responsibility (as
chairman of the Council for Aboriginal
Affairs) to Dr. Coombs, the Aborigines
are about to enter a new year with
only a little more going for them than
before World War 11, when they were
expected to take their handout of
weekly rations, slide into their humpies,
and shut up.
If Dr. Coombs is given enough
money, sets up an efficient organisa-
tion, and really tackles the job of find-
ing out what could and should be done
for the Aborigines, he might easily be
too busy during 1968 for his other job
as chairman of the Australian Council
for the Arts. (And it yet remains to
be seen which of the two jobs interests
him most.) There is so much to be
done, and so many people want it to
be seen to be done. The referendum
voting indicated it, and since then mani-
fest public pressure has made the Fed-
eral Government switch quickly from
a “the States are doing a good job, we
won’t really interfere” line to “well,
let’s make a gesture.” But it is doubt-
ful whether that will do, either.
Ignorance about Aborigines still rises
little above zero. In New South Wales
during 1966-67 a Parliamentary Joint
Committee established a few, mostly
unscientifically collected, facts, and a
few more about those who could be
said to be caring for them, the N.S.W.
Aborigines’ Welfare Board and staff. In
that State there are an estimated 15,000
admitted Aborigines left. The Board
says this figure includes 127 full-
bloods, about 7500 half-castes and up-
ward, and as many lighter who for
various reasons prefer to remain Abo-
rigines rather than join the whites.
(Government statisticians say there are
about 1500 full-bloods and about 13,000
“others.”)
No shred of full native culture sur-
vives. Only one small tribe in northern
N.S.W., the Bungalong, continues to
speak an Aboriginal language, but
many of even its members, along with
scores of others from across the State,
are drifting into Sydney’s older suburbs
(such as Redfern and Newtown) and
out of the Board’s care.
So the 15,000 in N.S.W. vary from
those gathering in two or three Sydney
suburbs to about 6000 remaining on
the Board’s settlements and “stations,”
to humpy-dwelling “outsiders” who
will not come in, who do not want to
be kept or controlled. The Board’s field
staff, untainted with scientific pro-
cedures, acts on experience and endless
goodwill, but still represents “white
authority” with a continuing legacy of
yesterdays. Fringe dwellers will not
come on to the settlements, reserve
Aborigines, who could easily pass into
the white population, reject education
for jobs which do not exist outback,
and even “assimilated” Aborigines will
not apply for $7OOO housing loans at
$lOO deposit and 3J percent interest.
From this evidence, and its implica-
tions, it seems doubtful whether
“assimilation,” or the N.S.W. Board’s
gentle paternalism, would bring the
reserve Aborigines into the 20th century
before it becomes the 21st. Queens-
land’s system of caring for nearly
20,000 Aborigines (including 7000 full-
bloods) and nearly 5000 (mostly full-
blood) Torres Strait Islanders is
equally paternalistic but less gentle. Its
wards have been gathered centrally on
to large reserves (former Church con-
trol of some ended this year), and
taught primary skills, but remain in-
side-outsiders. They are not allowed to
live in humpies, nor to move into Red-
ferns or East Perths. So they are prob-
ably as much in a never-never state as
their N.S.W. brothers. Each year
Queensland’s Aborigines from all
reserves meet in council, and in 1967
they declared in unanimous favor of
Queensland policy, just in case the
Commonwealth had any supra-paternal
ideas.
But the Commonwealth has troubles
in its own Territory. Dexter Daniels
was arrested this month as a vagrant
on his own reserve, with $lB in his
pocket. (People housed on N.S.W.
reserves owed their Board over
$150,000 in’unpaid $2 rents by 1966,
and remained free.) The Common-
wealth’s Northern Territory also has
roughly 20,000 Aborigines but there
15,000 are full-bloods ranging from
desert nomads to a few educated, well-
housed and employed people in Dar-
win. In between, 19,990 problems.
Employers of black stockmen seem as
reluctant to move into this century as
some Aborigines are to leave the safety
of reserves. And, in fact, in the Terri-
tory where else is there to go? What
can white man’s education and
improvement offer the future Territory
Aboriginal except maddening frustra-
tion?
Darwin and Alice Springs have
schools, but the Aborigines’ own family-
social pressures (toward early un-
skilled jobs if they can be found) mixed
with a “we can’t win, what’s the use
of trying” attitude obviously will thrust
them into crisis as the nation rushes
toward an era of skilled-only labor.
New South Wales, during the past 20
years, has turned out only 120 Abori-
ginal secondary students, of whom 55
passed the Intermediate Certificate and
only 13 the sth-year Leaving.
It seems more than time for the
Commonwealth to stare at the Abor-
igines’ future at least as hard as it is
being forced to examine that of
Papua-New Guinea natives, whom
Aborigines might well envy. Decisions
taken as easily and readily as when
former Territories Minister Hasluck
and five State Aborigines’ Welfare
Board chairmen approved the assimila-
tion policy no longer seem thoughtful
enough. Emptying some 80,000 “blacks”
into a 12 million white population and
hoping they will become lighter until
they disappear is naturally attractive,
but one of the Boards’ chairmen, Mr.
Kingsmill, of N.S.W., has since said
he does not think it is what the
Aborigines want. They may accept it,
but they do not want it, nor really
know what they want.
Some of the Aborigines who have
thrown themselves into the proving
oven in Sydney and Perth will now
find out whether they will become
merged into the city populations, or
prefer to remain islands in white com-
munities, as one group of original in-
habitants has managed to do at La
A. G. Kingsmill, Aborigines’ Welfare
Board chairman in N.S.W. . . assimi-
lation doubts


Perouse, in Sydney. Meanwhile, not
one social scientist, male or female, is
watching their progress. The N.S.W.
Board cannot; it has no qualified per-
son of any kind for any of its work,
though it has tried hard to find one.
What the State Aborigines’ Welfare
Boards begin to try to do during 1968,
with or without Commonwealth help,
interest, or persuasion, might well be-
come crucial in, say, A.D. 2000, when
Aborigines born now will be 32-year-
old Australians. Will they be “merged”
city dwellers, one way or another; or
still existing apathetically on reserves;
or somewhere else learning a remade
Aboriginal culture imported from the
Northern Territory to earn money
from the overseas tourists?
These speculations are made only
to point out that there is not a world
of time in which the Originals can
be left to work out their own destiny,
unaided and on impulse. There seem
to be too many gaps to bridge—gaps
between those on reserves and their
education for skilled jobs and the
places where those jobs are; between
the white 19th century where many are
being kept and the 21st century which
may suddenly crash upon them; be-
tween theoretical assimilation and the
possibility that they may prefer to
stay in city pockets and flourish as
a self-engendered “nation”; and even
between white people thinking of
Aborigines as “them” instead of a part
of “us,” and vice versa.
Dr. Coombs and his future Council
within the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment would seem to have much work
cut out for them.
Technology
Home-grown, but still in the nursery
WHEN THE Department of Supply
called tenders for the establishment of
micro-electronic capacity, this was the
first serious indication that the Aus-
tralian Government planned to use ex-
penditure on defence to increase the
technological capability of Australian
industry. Up to October, the invariable
practice had been to buy off-the-shelf
electronic gear from overseas. It will be
a long and painful practice growing our
own. But in terms of increasing the
technological level of Australian in-
dustry, it is a start.
The main use of these micro-circuits
will be in communications. These
smaller, more exact, and versatile elec-
tronic building blocks will, however,
open up many other possibilities.
Micro-circuits are about as big a step
forward as the jump from valves to
transistors. First transistors were linked
with printed circuits. Then came the
breakthrough which saw complete cir-
cuits, which could be used to operate
a radio or television receiver or serve
as a basic building unit in a computer
fabricated into a one-piece “chip.” This
complete circuit, with its almost ab-
stract design of components, is roughly
the size of a badge on a man’s tie bar
if a somewhat expensive one.
Introduction of micro-circuits put the
greater part of the electronics industry
back to square one as far as production
goes. Their advantages of reliability
and promise of speed and economy are
so great that they made much of the
old electronics industry obsolete.
Australia must acquire techniques in
micro-electronics if it is to play a part
in communications development in the
Pacific area. The biggest development
in this field in the year was the unveil-
ing of the United States’ “Project Mal-
lard,” a combined satellite and ground
system capable of bringing battlefield
commanders in touch with the head of
the Government in the participating
countries, which include Australia. If
Australia is to win its share of contracts
in this big development, our design
capacity and industry must have the
skills to compete with the United
States, Canada, and Britain.
Also in the communications field,
during the year we neared completion
on our important ground station at
Moree, which will tie us in eventually
to the world-satellite net. Last week
Moree was testing its systems with the
American Intelsat, which is stationed in
a synchronous orbit high over the mid-
Pacific.
In this new sophisticated field, one
of the leaders was Qantas. The airline
carried out its own satellite communica-
tions tests, keeping voice contact with
a specially equipped airliner right
across the Pacific. There was little
difference in reception whether the air-
craft was flying on or off the ground. A
new series of tests, embodying the
lessons learned this year, will be car-
ried out next year.
Qantas also decided to take Aus-
tralia into the newest technology of all
■ — the avionics clean room. Aerospace
has developed techniques and instru-
ments with fantastically accurate capa-
bilities: for instance, during the year
Pan American steered an airliner from
Honolulu to Sydney with an automatic
guidance device and reached the end
of the flight with an accuracy of about
six miles. But maintenance of this
equipment calls for clinically, in fact,
super-clinically, clean conditions. The
permissible dust count is somewhere
around less than a millionth of normal
city air. Temperatures must be con-
trolled precisely. In the countries with
a space industry, industrialists have
said that they can measure a country’s
development by the number of clean
rooms it possesses. Work started on
the Qantas installation this month.
This marks a major divergence in
policy between the Government and
its overseas airline. Although Qantas
has the contract to repair parts of the
guidance systems of the coming Orion
reconnaissance and anti-submarine air-
craft and the Fill, the Air Department
has still clung to the notion that it must
depend on American industry for some
of the key gyroscopes. These items are
repairable, but the RAAF decision is to
junk them on the grounds that it will
be cheaper to replace rather than repair
them. A decision like this means that
Australia is permanently “buttoned-
in” to the United States and a long
supply line.
Another major advance was in com-
puters. The first third-generation com-
puters, like the 18M360 series, came
into effective use in Australia. In
industry, many of the implications of
the new information revolution were
beginning to be appreciated. Last year
Moree satellite communications earth station will tie in with a world, network


and next year might mark a water-
shed in the use of computers. The
computer’s decision-making capabilities
are still to be realised. The Word is
contained only within a small tech-
nological elite at the moment. The
year 1969 could see this Gospel rise
into the upper levels of Management.
Another big technological advance
was in the traditional heavy industries.
Pelletisation plants for iron ore an
advanced new process were given
the go-ahead for Whyalla, Hamersley,
and the Savage River. And across the
country, at Gladstone, Queensland, the
alumina plant came on stream. Overall,
it was a year of greater movement than
usual.
The Arts
Prescribing the
cultural dose
IN 1968, DR. H. C. COOMBS will
take over as chairman of the new Arts
Council. There is no doubt that he will
bring to this position the same qualities
of energy, positiveness, and attention to
detail which he displayed as chairman
of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust; in
fact, the whole catalogue of the least
desirable qualities for the job.
The appointment in November was in
general greeted by uneasy silence. It
was undoubtedly a disappointment that
the Government should merely hand
Dr. Coombs the Arts, and, of course,
the Aborigines, on a plate to ensure his
earlier departure from the Reserve
Bank. Dr. Coombs had, after all, failed
almost entirely with the Elizabethan’s
basic tasks; to foster enlightened
official attitudes to sponsoring the Arts
and to create a climate in which first-
class people in the performing Arts
could work happily and with origin-
ality.
But the grave disappointment is that
the setting-up of the Arts Council is
not to be preceded by an inquiry into
the Arts so that informed and inter-
ested people can make their views
known before the Council takes shape.
In spite of the stark experience of the
Vincent report on television, most
people connected with the Arts still
have a belief in the usefulness of such
an inquiry. However, the Government’s
ad hoc and cynical approach sets us a
full generation behind Canada, which
is the most relevant comparison in
point of population and distance, in
intelligent patronage of the Arts.
The measure of how muddled and
elementary thinking still is is the pro-
posal that “educational and cultural
films for television” will receive help
from the new Arts Council, but,
according to the Prime Minister, “the
question of a film corporation needs
further study.” This is a perfect illus-
tration of the official attitude: you’ll
have culture because it’s good for you,
but we’ll prescribe the dose.
It is silly enough to split films down
the middle; “cultural and educational
films” probably being those which no
one watches. However, the establish-
ment of a commercial film industry
could be one of the best and perhaps
even cheapest ways of helping the Arts.
Britain got a national theatre, not be-
cause Sir Laurence Olivier was self-
sacrificing but because he had earned
enough in films to spend time in the
less financially rewarding theatre.
There is no doubt that if Australian
actors, musicians, and designers earned
comparatively large sums in a short
time in films, many of them would
return to the theatre, temporarily at
least, financially independent, and,
because financially independent, more
independent in mind.
Meanwhile, we shall continue to get
French and Russian ballets and Italian
operas passed through the British filter
and aimed at about the Sadler’s Wells
standard. But in 1967 there were hope-
ful signs in drama. The Independent,
Sydney, with some help from the
N.S.W. Government, established itself
as a repertory theatre and has currently
six plays either in production or
rehearsal. With one bound the Old
Tote, with its plans for a new timber
theatre at the University of N.S.W.,
freed itself from any future respon-
sibility of trying to present drama in
the concrete bunker of the Opera
House. However, progress in Melbourne
and Sydney seemed matched by
regression or stagnation in Adelaide,
Brisbane, and Perth.
Otherwise, the basic cultural pattern
that much is spent on buildings and
little on people remains; what the final
end of this might be is hard to judge.
No sooner had Melbourne finished its
splendid cultural centre and begun to
move in its extensive art collection than
Canberra announced that work was to
begin on the National Gallery, esti-
mated to cost $4 million. Already art
dealers’ eyes are lighting up at the sight
of buyers for the National Gallery. As
most good early work is already in
State Galleries, the acquisition of a
national collection of historic works can
only inflate prices of inferior work.
The Sydney Opera House panel of
architects now manages to carry on
work with the same degree of secretive-
ness that its predecessor, Mr. Joern
Utzon, achieved, but no doubt the
watchdogs have got only one eye closed.
Although many country towns now
have expensive, if little used, civic
theatres, the two festival cities, Perth
and Adelaide, are no nearer to a suit-
able hall or theatre, either one would
do, as central focus for their endeavors.
Nineteen sixty seven showed that
attitudes to people in the Arts can be
ambivalent. Sidney Nolan, who has
Dr. Coombs . . . Arts and Aborigines
in 1968
spent much of his life outside Aus-
tralia, was greeted as a favorite son
with a massive retrospective in pro-
cession from State Gallery to State
Gallery. Christina Stead, who has also
spent many years outside her native
country, was ruled ineligible for the
Britannica award for literature.
The Australian Broadcasting Commis-
sion, although undoubtedly aware of
how much good it did Australia in
Asia to employ a Negro as musical
director of the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra, came to a parting of the
ways with Dean Dixon.
The most heartening development,
and there is no reason to think it only
of short term, is the extent to which
Australians can attract audiences. In
1967, theatres were filled because of
people like June Bronhill, Marilyn
Jones, Donald Smith, Mark McManus,
Nancye Hayes, and Hayes Gordon, and,
apart from Gobbi for the Adelaide
Festival, most of 1968’s announced plans
are on the same hopeful basis. These
people are stars. It remains only to
pay and treat them as such.
New Guinea
Nowhere in safety
“THE END OF A journey is not only
a matter of going faster but also of
arriving safely,” said Mr. Paul Has-
luck, speaking of Papua-New Guinea
when Minister for Territories. The last
two words of this august maxim appear
to have become a motto of the Depart-
ment, and “going faster” to have been
erased from the records. Whether the
Territory’s second House of Assembly,


to be elected during 1968, will be as
agreeable as the June, 1964, one can be
doubted. Although the rate of “grass-
roots” change within eastern New
Guinea is proceeding at a reasonable
pace, almost no large, visible, impres-
sive changes occurred during the first
30 months of the Assembly’s life. Most
notably, the new House to gather next
June will consist of 84 Elected Mem-
bers (only 43 nominations so far), ten
appointed Official, and ten elected
Special Members.
It still will have no policy-making
powers, and New Guineans’ opportuni-
ties to make mistakes in politics and
administration while under guidance,
and learn from them, will remain very
limited. Since 1964 ten Elected native
Members have served as understudies
(Under-Secretaries) in Administration
Departments in Port Moresby; and this
year a House Select Committee recom-
mended that seven be designated Min-
isters and share control of their de-
partments with the present European
heads in 1968, and that another nine
should become Assistant Ministers.
Probably Canberra will have to accept
some part of this soon, for a UN
Trusteeship Council Mission which
recommended a stronger version three
years ago is due to revisit the Terri-
tory any day now.
The Australian Government’s “arriv-
ing safely” and the Trusteeship Coun-
cil’s “going faster” conflict of ideas
have provided the highlights of New
Guinea’s recent history. This year, when
the Pangu Pati was launched to con-
test the 1968 elections on the issue of
independence, it was closer to the UN
line than to that of Territories Minister
Barnes, who promptly deplored the
formation of new political parties. Even
as he did so, a Trusteeship Council
committee of two, from New Zealand
and Nationalist China, was saying that
new parties should be encouraged.
This and other recent ineptitudes by
Mr. Barnes have only been Australian
Government policy badly expressed.
Australia’s stand for gradual develop-
ment in New Guinea is sensible in those
simple terms, but refusing to allow “the
pace of political development to be set
by a small minority . . . only 5000
with any degree of sophistication” is
another thing, especially when certain
facts cast serious doubt on the esti-
mate’s accuracy.
What is “any degree of sophistica-
tion”? Would not 150,000 in primary
and 5000 in secondary schools, about
3000 in the Army, 3000 in the Police,
several hundreds of new farmers and
small businessmen making better money
than public servants, and 15,000
registered in trade unions seem to
provide a base for at least guided home-
rule fairly soon, to continue until in-
dependence; say, within ten years?
With no timetable, without even a
draft constitution for home-rule, it
should not be amazing that many
question Australia’s intentions in New
Guinea. Australians might wonder just
what ideal is being sought; and how
long the journey will take, at what
eventual cost (it is currently about $7O
million a year, net). In New Guinea
the questions have a different intent,
although, with the same base, a public-
relations failure. About 97 percent of
the Territory’s 2,200,000 are subsistence
farmers and natural ultra-conservatives
according to former Assistant Adminis-
trator Dr. John Gunther. They fear an
Australian pull-out which would leave
the “smart coastal natives” in power.
The latter have a childlike fear that
their parent might get sick of them
and leave them destitute, so they take
few risks.
Saying “Trust us,” as Australia does
to all critics, foreign or indigenous,
loses credibility when the latter see a
year go by as unprogressively as 1967.
It began with the installation of a new
Administrator, Mr. Hay, who promised
that “the Government would not be
slow to make constitutional or political
changes if the people want them,” and
mentioned two transitional steps soon
to be considered . . . “toward a form
of ministerial government and an in-
crease in local financial responsibility
to match the Territory’s increasing con-
tribution to the Budget.” On the first,
no decision; mention of the second
causes tremors in Canberra.
Last year the Select Committee’s very
conservative recommendations included
one relating to finance. It went only so
far as to recommend that a Budget
committee of five Elected Members
be appointed “to provide a link” with
House and Administration on finance;
but purely advisory. It is clear enough
that timidity toward the parent is the
keystone in today’s “guided democ-
racy” New Guinea, and that pushing
is required, not restraint. But it suits
an Australian Government too busy
trying to give New Guinea a “sound
economy” and broadly based non-
political education hoping perhaps
in 15 or 20 years to hand over to a
Oala-Rarua of the Pangu Pati
nation which will be a friendly carbon
copy of Australia.
This dream must seem splendid in
Canberra one which will make Aus-
tralia’s name ring throughout the
world, eventually. (There were similar
dreams about other colonies, too.) And
they may be right, or dreadfully wrong.
While Australia is guiding New Guinea
along the right path, the Territory is
changing and the people with it. New
classes are being created, tribal
rivalries are deepening, the society is
unable to stand still. Whatever is
handed over finally may not fit the
dream, and if the government at that
time lacks political sophistication
gained from long experience during the
transition, it might not last any time
at all. And that would not be “arriving
safely,” in any of New Guinea’s 750
languages and dialects.
The trade unions
Many will find the going more difficult
FOR THE Trade Union Movement
the year ends with a big and largely
unexpected bonus, with the Arbitration
Commission in the role of Santa Claus.
The majority judgment of Judge
Gallagher and Commissioner Winter is
not much less historic than the original
basic wage decision of Judge Hilgins
in the Harvester judgment 60 years
a g o
As The Bulletin has been saying for
some time, the big gains for the unions
lie not so much in arguing for in-
creases on /general economic grounds as
in basing their cases on the relative
value of the work performed. The
Arbitration Commission, in its latest
awards to metal-trades workers, has
clearly pointed the way to substantial
future rises. Indeed, in Judge Gal-
lagher’s judgment there is an indica-
tion that if the unions had fought a
better case and asked for larger rises
they might very well have won them.
xhe - or industria , problem for the
unions 1968 t 0 italUe on this
i A uv a- , r TT .
la‘«t Arbitration award. Until recently
,he >' have relied on one major applica-
tion to the Commission based on a
claim for a basic wage increase and
presented by the ACTU. Now they
have to engage in a series of complex
and technical cases based on the value
of work in particular trades and occu-
pations. The ACTU does not have the
staff to conduct such cases. Most of
the unions have a similar problem,
lacking the advantages of skilled advo-
cates and research staff to present the


appropriate evidence to the Commis-
sion.
In a time of unprecedented arbitra-
tion opportunities for skilled and semi-
skilled workers, the union movement
suffers the added disability of being
rent by political faction fights. At the
ACTU level the executive is split ex-
actly in half on a range of issues, all
of which are reflections of divisions on
matters of political principle and am-
bition. One side is led by men like
McDonald, the communist secretary of
the Brisbane Trades and Labor Coun-
cil, Geitzelt of the Miscellaneous
Workers’ Union, Devereux of the
Amalgamated Engineering Union, and
Fitzgibbon of the Waterside Workers.
The other side is led by the ACTU
secretary, Souter, Melbourne Trades
Hall secretary, Jordon, and his counter-
parts in Adelaide, Sydney, and Hobart
—Brown, Marsh, and Haradeen. At
present they have the support of the
president, Monk.
The first group are currently spruik-
ing for ACTU research officer Hawke
as Monk’s successor and show every
sign of trying to force the ACTU to
actively oppose the Federal Govern-
ment’s foreign policy. They also have
proposed a number of sensible and
necessary measures to make the ACTU
more efficient.
With a couple of notable excep-
tions, their opponents in the moderate
camp are still tied to pre-automation
unionism, but they are opposed to
increased communist influence in the
ACTU and national affairs. They will
vote for Souter to replace Monk when
he retires.
The two groups have split bitterly
on the question of filling vacancies on
the ACTU executive, and such divisions
have made it difficult for one side
or the other to promote policies which
would add extra and expert staff to
the ACTU, increase its working
efficiency, and allow the nation’s
largest association of workers to pursue
its legitimate economic and industrial
objectives. The ACTU political split
is mirrored in most Trades and Labor
Councils, particularly in Melbourne,
where the Communists and their allies
have tried to starve a moderate execu-
tive into submission by refusing to pay
their dues.
So the year 1968 looms up with
most of the important union organisa-
tions absorbed in factional battles and
poorly prepared to win for unionists
the large potential gains which the
Arbitration Commission says are there
for the proving. Most of the unions
are even less prepared for the rapid
onset of automative processes.
In clerical offices the increased use
of computers is revealed in the figures
that six years ago there were less than
a dozen electronic data-processing
machines in Australia: now there are
nearly 500. These machines, and others
like them in the blue-collar field, raise
problems associated with the dismissal
of staff, the re-training of staff, the
relocation of staff from one capital city
to another, the introduction of shift
work in new industries, and the creation
of machinery to deal with these and
other human problems.
But with some exceptions, and those
mostly in the white-collar field, unions
are still being run in ways which
suggest that their leaders are not sure
that the motor-car is here to stay and
believe the tape-recorder is a dubious
luxury.
As their problems of administration,
research, and advocacy increase, the
smaller unions will find the going
increasingly difficult and the new year
should see a mounting number of
amalgamations. As the pressures of
work-value cases and automation
increase, incompetent union officials
will be more exposed to competition
and their performances compared with
men as demonstrably able as Gietzelt,
Forrester, and Ducker in New South
Wales, Maynes, Hawke, Carmichael,
and McDonald in Victoria, or Coleman
in Western Australia.
Whilst there is every overt sign that
union politics will be hotter in the new
year, the strains of facing new problems
such as those of work-value cases and
automation may temper the factions
and lead to some co-operation and con-
ciliation. Unless the political fights
simmer down, 1968 could be a lost
year for many of the workers the unions
claim to represent.
Immigration
The hard sell
VICTORIAN BILLY SNEDDEN has
always had the reputation for being
one of the more able and innovative
administrators in the Liberal Govern-
ment, and 1967 saw the Immigration
Department benefit from his Minister-
ship.
If he closed the year with a silly
decision in refusing a visa to a cam-
paigner against the Greek military
Government, this was a minor blemish
on a year of solid progress in the less
sensational aspects of the Department’s
work. Though it is paradoxical to
start with this proposition for the third
year in a row, the number of new
settlers arriving in Australia has fallen.
When the statistics are added up for
1967 they are likely to show a total
of only a little more than 130,000
arrivals, compared to 140,000 and
150,000 in previous years. But disap-
pointing though this is, it is the pro-
duct of conditions in 1966 a degree
of difficulty in getting jobs in Aus-
tralia and strong competition from
Germany, France, and Canada for
migratory workers.
Snedden achieved a number of
breakthroughs. Italy, our second
source of immigrants after Britain, was
finally persuaded, after six years of
intermittent and inconclusive negotia-
tions, into signing an Immigration
Agreement on the occasion of Presi-
dent Saragat’s State visit to Australia.
Officials hope for a quick revival of
Italian immigration in the wake of
the new agreement. Much more spec-
tacular was the quickly negotiated
agreement with our Gallipoli foes
the Turks.
This was the first formal arrange-
ment with a Muslim country, and
indicated the eastward shift of what
the Australian Government regards as
“Europe” for purposes of active immi-
grant recruitment. By June, 1968, the
Department hopes to have attracted,
under assisted passage arrangements,
about 2000 Turkish settlers. The annual
rate should rise quickly to 5000 and
possibly later to 10,000 a year, making
Turkey our third main source of
settlers.
A real achievement lay in the fact
that 1967 was in relation to Asian
immigration “incident free.” A handful
of illegal entrants, mostly ships’
deserters and stowaways, some of them
Asian, were deported as usual. But
there were no Willie Wong or Nancy
Prasad cases to tarnish Australia’s
international reputation.
Visas were given to Vietnamese
orphan children, approved for adoption
by State welfare authorities to come
as settlers. Thirty Chinese stowaways
who have managed to avoid deporta-
tion for several years look like being
allowed to settle permanently, in an
apparently more liberal application of
immigration powers.
So the remnants of the old “White
Australia Policy” continue to be eroded
away. Asian immigration remains small
but it is increasing steadily. The number
of non-Europeans applying and being
accepted as settlers has doubled in the
past year.
One of the major gains to Australia
from Minister Snedden’s tour of Europe
in the first half of the year was in
increasing the Department’s freedom to
openly advertise and recruit for immi-
grants. Understandably, emigration
campaigning is politically unpopular in
the prosperous Europe in the 19605.
Nationalists talk of emigration as a
“national haemorrage” and pressure is
put on government to restrict other
Immigration’s Snedden . . . solid pro-
gress


countries’ canvassing for settlers. Mr.
Snedden was able to get some valuable
relaxation of these restrictions. In Hol-
land we are advertising in the Press
for the fii'st time “emigrate to Aus-
tralia for a hundred gilders.” In Ger-
many, too, we are about to begin
freer recruitment.
The publicity budget of the Depart-
ment is still modest $1,400,000 this
year but is a good proportional
advance on last year. It has enabled TV
advertising to start in Britain, and a
good number of films to be put around.
In Scandinavia, particularly, Australia
is getting wider publicity. The Com-
monwealth Film Unit is peddling a
variety of films on aspects of Australian
life. As an example, one light-hearted
short is a play on recreational opportu-
nities in Australia and the contrast with
crowded urban Europe. It demonstrates
the ease with which the ordinary man
here can go fishing at the weekend, and
actually have a reasonable chance of
catching something.
The Department is active in attempts
to exploit events to keep Australia in
the forefront of potential emigrants’
minds. Saragat’s visit was most useful
in stimulating interest in Italy. Right
now with the Spanish tennis team here
to compete in the Davis Cup, Depart-
mental people are trying to get plenty
of Australian news back to Spain, with
the tennis racquet, by showing Spanish
journalists around.
At this end there is a full apprecia-
tion of the need to provide better
facilities for immigrants when they
arrive. Wartime hostels are being torn
down and replaced by civilised build-
ings, and $8,000,000 is being spent on
new hostels at Randwick, N.S.W., and
Springvale, Vic. For the first time flats
are being built as a substitute for
hostels as temporary accommodation.
New techniques are being applied to
make the formalities of naturalisation
and immigrant sponsorship easier.
Mobile caravan offices are making visits
to major shopping centres and factories
in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide.
Some sociological work on immigrant
problems is appearing at last a
study of immigrant youth was pub-
lished in Melbourne, and in Canberra
a major study of why immigrants go
home, with recommendations on how
to reduce the loss. Mr. Snedden is
likely soon to announce that second-go
immigrants will be eligible for assisted
passage.
So, if these various measures are pur-
sued, the short-term prospects for in-
creasing immigration look good. Appli-
cations are rising in most immigration
offices overseas —especially in devalued
Britain and this promises well for
1968.
But as yet there are no signs of
any bold new attempts to find new
sources of immigrants. There is
occasionally talk of looking to nearer
countries like Singapore, with an
educated, skilled, English-speaking
population. But so far it is only talk.
The days of active campaigning in
such places are some time off, but
spontaneous applications to emigrate
will be increasingly welcome.
Only reactionary trade union groups
stand in the way of more liberal
approach to employment of Japanese
technicians and tradesmen.
The long-term future of emigration
to Australia looked somewhat bleaker
as a result of depressing researches by
ANU economist Brian Haig. In a book
published in December, he suggested
that Australian living standards and
social services are becoming increas-
ingly deficient in relation to those of
most countries from whom we seek
immigrants.
The freedoms
More and less
THERE IS NO DANGER of Austra-
lia creating a permissive society in the
new year, but looser living as dis-
tinct from living in licence for 1968
begins in Tasmania. From January 1
the Labor Government will permit
retail trading for 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
A critic from one of the big retail
stores, all of which are opposed to the
new hours, said the Premier, Mr.
Reece, was trying to make Hobart into
“a little New York,” and the big-
business attack on the liberalisation of
trading was supported by the secretary
of the Hobart Trades Hall Council,
who claimed that “the question of
shopping hours has been thrown into
jungle law—the survival of the fit-
test.” The exposure of the new philo-
sophy of laxity was maintained by the
president of the Master Drapers’
Association, who predicted disaster
and chaos.
Easier living comes hard to pace-
setting Tasmania. It came more gently
to South Australia, which this year was
the last of the Australian States to
introduce 10 o’clock closing for hotels.
Amidst abounding predictions of
doom, the State Government intro-
duced a number of measures which
it called “liquor reform” and its oppo-
nents called “late closing.” Since the
late closing-liquor reform, the number
of convictions for drunkenness are said
to have diminished.
Playing it fast and loose, the South
Australian Government introduced
legislation to amend and relax the
State’s severe Sunday Observance laws.
This liberality drew the charge from
the secretary of the Lord’s Day
Observance Society that the Govern-
ment had “struck a severe blow at the
whole structure of our civilisation,
which was established, and hitherto
operating, upon Christian principles.”
However, the conservative Adelaide
“Advertiser” assured its readers that
they were still quite a way from “a
gay, uninhibited, Continental Sunday.”
In Queensland the battleground was
“civil liberties” in the form of the
rights to march and demonstrate: not
for anything in particular apart from
the rights to march and demonstrate.
Students and some staff marched and
demonstrated in defiance of the orders
of the Government and police. Some
concessions were made, such as the
right to carry approved banners with-
out paying a fee, but other restrictions
were maintained, and with militant
unions joining in, 1968 promises to be
a good year in Brisbane for marching
and demonstrating. Short-term money
is on the police. Long-term investments
have been placed on the demonstrators.
A quieter national campaign has-
been that of some academics, medical
authorities, and other interested parties
to get governments to have a closer
look at the subtleties of the drug prob-
Summer and the living is easier
lem before rushing in to outlaw LSI>
and increase narcotics penalties all
round. The argument has been that
LSD, when taken under supervision,
marihuana under any circumstances,
and even the amphetamines and
cocaine, are less dangerous drugs thau
alcohol and, possibly, tobacco. No
demonstrations of any serious kind, and
no success: It is clear, that no Aus-
tralian Government or political Party
is brave (or silly) enough to muck
around with the evil word “drug.”
But for lovers of looser living there
was some consolation in the wide
manifestation of mini-skirts in Sydney
and Melbourne, and in the double
standard allegedly adopted by the
producers of the Australian Broadcast-
ing Commission, which permitted their
patrons a much larger view of naked
flesh (female) than the Broadcasting
Control Board would allow viewers of
the commercial channels. The new
year, however, is likely to see abolition
of this double standard by ministerial
fiat.
Whilst Mr. Hulme was announcing
that the ABC was likely to lose its
late-won looseness, a small but signifi-
cant item was passed in the Legislative
Council which wins for Victoria the
Liberty Award for the year. An amend-
ment to the Victorian Juries Bill now
allows that pregnant women convicted
of capital offences may not be sen-
tenced to death, but may only be de-
tained at the Governor’s pleasure.


REPORT
FROM IRON MOUNTAIN
Beginning in this issue: the first of three instalments from the book
<e ßeport from Iron Mountain on the Possibility and Desirability of Peace * by Leonard C. Lewin.
Is this book a hoax? Or is it a factual record? Was there really a Special
Study Group in America that concluded that lasting peace is probably unattainable and might in
any case not be in the best interests of society? To The Bulletin the answer seems
plain enough: the book is neither a hoax nor a factual record 3 but social comment conveyed
in the form of a tale.
JOHN DOE, as I will call him here
for reasons that will be made clear, is
a professor at a large university in the
Middle West. His field is one of the
social sciences, but I will not identify
him beyond this. He telephoned me one
evening last winter, quite unexpec-
tedly; we had not been in touch for
several years. He was in New York
for a few days, he said, and there was
something important he wanted to
discuss with me. He wouldn’t say what
it was. We met for lunch the next day
at a midtown restaurant.
He was obviously disturbed. He made
small talk for half an hour, which was
quite out of character, and I didn’t
press him. Then, apropos of nothing, he
mentioned a dispute between a writer
arid a prominent political family that
had been in the headlines. What, he
wanted to know, were my views on
“freedom of information”? How would
I qualify them? And so on. My answers
were not memorable, but they seemed
to satisfy him. Then, quite abruptly,
he began to tell me the following
story:
Early in August of 1963, he said, he
found a message on his desk that a
“Mrs. Potts” had called him from
Washington. When he returned the
call, a man answered immediately, and
told Doe, among other things, that he
had been selected to serve on a com-
mission “of the highest importance.”
Its objective was to determine,
accurately and realistically, the nature
of the problems that would confront
the United States if and when a con-
dition of “permanent peace” should
arrive, and to draft a program for
dealing with this contingency.
The man described the unique pro-
cedures that were to govern the com-
mission’s work and that were expected
to extend its scope far beyond that of
any previous examination of these prob-
lems.
Considering that the caller did not
precisely identify either himself or his
agency, his persuasiveness must have
been of a truly remarkable order. Doe
entertained no serious doubts of the
bona fides of the project, however,
chiefly because of his previous experi-
ence with the excessive secrecy that
often surrounds quasi-governmental
activities. In addition, the man at the
other end of the line demonstrated an
impressively complete and surprisingly
detailed knowledge of Doe’s work and
personal life. He also mentioned the
names of others who were to serve with
the group; most of them were known
to Doe by reputation. Doe agreed to
take the assignment he felt he had
no real choice in the matter —and to
appear the second Saturday following
at a location in another State. An air-
line ticket arrived in his mail the next
morning.
The cloak-and-dagger tone of this
convocation was further enhanced by
the meeting place itself, an underground
nuclear hideout built into a mountain
and used by hundreds of large Ameri-
can corporations. Most of them use it as
an emergency storage vault for im-
portant documents. But a number of
them maintain substitute corporate
headquarters as well, where essential
personnel could presumably survive and
continue to work after an attack.
I WILL LEAVE most of the story of
the operations of the Special Study
Group, as the commission was formally
called, for Doe to tell in his own words.
At this point it is necessary to say only
that it met and worked regularly for
over two and a half years, after which
it produced a Report. It was this docu-
ment, and what to do about it, that
Doe wanted to talk to me about.
The Report, he said, was being sup-
pressed both by the Special Study
Group itself and by the government in-
teragency committee to which it had
been submitted. After months of agon-
ising, Doe had decided that he would
no longer be party to keeping it secret.
What he wanted from me was advice
and assistance in having it published.
He gave me his copy to read, with the
express understanding that if for any
reason I were unwilling to become in-
volved I would say nothing about it
to anyone else.
I read the Report that same night.
I will pass over my own reactions to
it, except to say that the unwillingness
of Doe’s associates to publicise their
findings became readily understandable.
What had happened was that they
had been so tenacious in their deter-
mination to deal comprehensively with
the many problems of transition to
peace that the original questions asked
of them were never quite answered.
Instead, this is what they concluded:
Lasting peace, while not theoretically
impossible, is probably unattainable;
even if it could be achieved it would
almost certainly not be in the best
interests of a stable society to achieve
it.
That is the gist of what they say.
Behind their qualified academic
language runs this general argument:
War fills certain functions essential to
the stability of our society; until other
ways of filling them are developed, the
war system must be maintained—and
improved in effectiveness.
It is not surprising that the Group,
in its Letter of Transmittal, did not
choose to justify its work to “the lay
reader, unexposed to the exigencies of
higher political or military respon-
sibility.” Its Report was addressed,
deliberately, to unnamed government
administrators of high rank; it assumed
considerable political sophistication
from this select audience. To the
general reader, therefore, the substance
of the document may be even more
unsettling than its conclusions. He may
not be prepared for some of its assump-
tions for instance, that most medical
advances are viewed more as problems
than as progress; or that poverty is
necessary and desirable, public postures
by politicians to the contrary notwith-
standing; or that standing armies are,
among other things, social-welfare in-
stitutions in exactly the same sense as
are old people’s homes and mental hos-
pitals. It may strike him as odd to find
the probable explanation of “flying-
saucer” incidents disposed of en passant
in less than a sentence. He may be less
surprised to find that the space program
and the “controversial” anti-missile
and fallout-shelter programs are under-
stood to have the spending of vast sums
of money, not the advancement of
science or national defence, as their
principal goal, and to learn that “mili-
tary” draft policies are only remotely
concerned with defence.
He may be offended to find the organ-
ised repression of minority groups, and
even the re-establishment of slavery,


seriously (and on the whole favorably)
discussed as possible aspects of a world
at peace. He is not likely to take kindly
to the notion of the deliberate inten-
sification of air and water pollution (as
part of a program leading to peace),
even when the reason for considering it
is made clear. That a world without
war will have to turn sooner rather than
later to universal test-tube procreation
will be less disturbing, if no more ap-
pealing. But few readers will not be
taken aback, at least, by a few lines in
the Report’s conclusions, repeated in its
formal recommendations, that suggest
that the long-range planning and
“budgeting” of the “optimum”
number of lives to be destroyed
annually in overt warfare is high on the
Group’s list of priorities for Govern-
ment action.
I cite these examples primarily to
warn the general reader what he can
expect. The statesmen and strategists
for whose eyes the Report was intended
obviously need no such protective
admonition.
It should be made clear that Doe
does not disagree with the substance
of the Report, which represents a
genuine consensus in all important re-
spects. He constituted a minority of
one—but only on the issue of disclos-
ing it to the general public. A look at
how the Group dealt with this ques-
tion will be illuminating.
The debate took place at the Group’s
last full meeting before the Report
was written, late in March, 1966, and
again at the mountain. Two facts must
be kept in mind, by way of background.
The first is that the Special Study
Group had never been explicitly
charged with or sworn to secrecy,
either when it was convened or at any
time thereafter. The second is that
the Group had nevertheless operated
as if it had been. This was assumed
from the circumstances of its inception
and from the tone of its instructions.
(The Group’s acknowledgement of help
from “the many persons . . . who con-
tributed so greatly to our work” is
somewhat equivocal; these persons were
not told the nature of the project for
which their special resources of in-
formation were solicited.)
Those who argued the case for keep-
ing the Report secret were admittedly
motivated by fear of the explosive
political effects that could be expected
from publicity.
Doe acknowledges the strong possi-
bility of public misunderstanding. But
he feels that if the sponsoring agency
had wanted to mandate secrecy, it
could have done so at the outset. It
could also have assigned the project to
one of the Government’s established
“think tanks,” which normally work on
a classified basis. So far as Doe was
concerned, there was such a thing as a
public right to know what was being
done on its behalf; the burden of proof
was on those who would abridge it.
If my account seems to give Doe the
better of the argument, despite his
failure to convince his colleagues, so
be it. My participation testifies that I
am not neutral. In my opinion, the de-
cision of the Special Study Group to
censor its own findings was not merely
timid but presumptuous.
I should state, for the record, that
I do not share the attitudes toward war
and peace, life and death, and survival
of the species manifested in the Report.
Few readers will. In human terms, it
is an outrageous document. But it does
represent a serious and challenging
effort to define an enormous problem.
And it explains, or certainly appears
to explain, aspects of American policy
otherwise incomprehensible by the
ordinary standards of commonsense.
What we may think of these explana-
tions is something else, but it seems to
me that we are entitled to know not
only what they are but whose they are.
By “whose” I don’t mean merely
the names of the authors of the Report.
Much more important, we have a right
to know to what extent their assump-
tions of social necessity are shared by
the decision-makers in our Government.
Which do they accept and which do
they reject? However disturbing the
answers, only full and frank discussion
offers any conceivable hope of solving
the problems raised by the Special
Study Group in their Report from The
Mountain.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
[The following account of the work-
ings of the Special Study Group is
taken verbatim from a series of tape-
recorded interviews I had with “John
Doe.” The transcript has been edited to
minimise the intrusion of my ques-
tions and comments, as well as for
length, and the sequence has been
revised in the interest of continuity.
—L.C.L. ]
How was the Group formed?
. . . The general idea for it, for this
kind of study, dates back at least to
1961. It started with some of the new
people who came into the Kennedy
administration, mostly, I think, with
McNamara, Bundy, and Rusk. They
were impatient about many things . . .
One of them was that no really serious
work had been done about planning
for peace—a long-range peace, that is,
with long-range planning.
Everything that had been written
on the subject [before 1961] was super-
ficial. There was insufficient apprecia-
tion of the scope of the problem. The
main reason for this, of course, was
that the idea of a real peace in the
world, general disarmament, and so on
was looked on as utopian. Or even
crackpot. This is still true, and it’s
easy enough to understand when you
look at what’s going on in the world
today ... It was reflected in the studies
that had been made up to that time.
They were not realistic . . .
The idea of the Special Study, the
exact form it would take, was worked
out early in ’63. . . . The settlement of
the Cuban missile affair had something
to do with it, but what helped most
to get it moving was the big changes
in military spending that were being
planned . . . plants being closed, reloca-
tions, and so forth. Most of it wasn’t
made public until much later. . . .
Who made the selection?
That’s something I can’t tell you. I
wasn’t involved with the preliminary
planning. The first I knew of it was
when I was called myself. ... I don’t
know what particular Government
agency approved the project.
Would you care to make a guess?
All right I think it was an ad hoc
committee, at or near the Cabinet level.
It had to be. I suppose they gave the
organisational job making arrange-
ments, paying the bills, and so on to
somebody from State or Defence or the
National Security Council. Only one of
us was in touch with Washington, and I
wasn’t the one. But I can tell you that
very, very few people know about us
. . . For instance, there was the Ackley
Committee [on the “Economic Impact
of Defence and Disarmament”]. It was
set up after we were. If you read their
report —the same old tune economic
reconversion, turning sword plants into
plowshare factories I think you’ll
wonder if even the President knew
about our Group. The Ackley Commit-
tee certainly didn’t.
Is that possible, really? I mean that
not even the President knew of your
commission?
Well, I don’t think there’s anything
odd about the Government attacking a
problem at two different levels. Or even
about two or three [Government] agen-
cies working at cross-purposes. It hap-
pens all the time. . . .
You have to remember —you’ve read
the Report—that what they wanted
from us was a different kind of think-
ing. It was a matter of approach.
Herman Kahn calls it “Byzantine”—no
agonising over cultural and religious
values. No moral posturing. It’s the
kind of thinking that Rand and the
Hudson Institute and IDA [The Insti-
tute for Defence Analysis] brought into
war planning . . . What they asked
us to do, and I think we did it, was to
give the same kind of treatment to the
hypothetical problems of peace as they
give to the hypothetical nuclear war . . .
Why was the project given to an out-
side commission? Why couldn’t it have
been handled directly by an appro-
priate Government agency?
■1 think that’s obvious, or should be.
The kind of thinking wanted from our
Group just isn’t to be had in a formal
Government operation. Too many con-
straints. Too many inhibitions. This isn’t
a new problem. Why else would outfits
like Rand and Hudson stay in business?
Any assignment that’s at all sophisti-
cated is almost always given to an out-
side group. This is true even in the
State Department, in the “grey” opera-
tions, those that are supposed to be
unofficial, but are really as official as
can be. Also with the CIA. . . .
For our study, even the private re-


IRON MOUNTAIN
search centres were too institutional.. ..
A lot of thought went into making sure
that our thinking would be unrestricted.
All kinds of little things. The way we
were called into the Group, the places
where we met, all kinds of subtle
devices to remind us . . .
What can you tell me about the mem-
bers of the Group?
I’ll have to stick to generalities . . .
There were 15 of us. The important
thing was that we represented a very
wide range of disciplines. And not all
academic. We had a lawyer and a
businessman. Also, a professional war
planner . . .
It’s true that there were no women
in the Group, but I don’t think that
was significant ... We were all Ameri-
can citizens, of course. And all, I can
say, in very good health, at least when
we began . . . You see, the first order
of business, at the first meeting, was
the reading of dossiers. They were
very detailed, and not just professional,
but also personal. They included medi-
cal histories . . . None of us had ever
had this experience, of a public inspec-
tion of credentials, or medical reports.
It was very disturbing . . .
But it was deliberate. The reason
for it was to emphasise that we were
supposed to make all our own decisions
on procedure, without outside rules.
This included judging each other’s
qualifications and making allowances
for possible bias.
[At this point I persuaded Doe that a
brief occupational description of the
individual members of the Group would
serve a useful purpose for readers of
the Report. The list which follows was
worked out on paper. The problem was
to give as much relevant information
as possible without violating Doe’s
commitment to protect his colleagues’
anonymity. It turned out to be very
difficult, especially in the cases of
those members who are very well
known. For this reason, secondary
areas of achievement or reputation are
usually not shown.
The simple alphabetical “names”
were assigned by Doe for convenient
reference; they bear no intended re-
lation to actual names. “Able” w r as the
Group’s Washington contact. It was he
who brought and read the dossiers, and
who most often acted as chairman.
“Arthur Able” is a historian and
political theorist who has served in
government.
“Bernard Baker” is a professor of
international law and a consultant on
Government operations.
“Charles Cox” is an economist, social
critic, and biographer.
“John Doe.”
“Edward Ellis” is a sociologist often
involved in public affairs.
“Frank Fox” is a cultural anthro-
pologist.
“George Green” is a psychologist,
educator, and developer of personnel
testing systems.
“Harold Hill” is a psychiatrist who
has conducted extensive studies of the
relationship between individual and
group hehaviour.
“John Jones” is a scholar and
literary critic.
“Martin Miller” is a physical
chemist whose work has received inter-
national recognition at the highest level.
“Paul Peters” is a biochemist who
has made important discoveries bear-
ing on reproductive processes.
“Richard Roe” is a mathematician
affiliated with an independent West
Coast research institution.
“Samuel Smith” is an astronomer,
physicist, and communications theorist.
“Thomas Taylor” is a systems
analyst and war planner who has writ-
ten extensively on war, peace, and inter-
national relations.
“William White” is an industrialist
who has undertaken many special Gov-
ernment assignments.]
How did the Group operate? I
mean, where and when did you yneet,
and so forth?
WE MET on the average of once a
month. Usually it was on weekends, and
usually for two days. We had a few
longer sessions, and one that lasted only
four hours. . . . We met all over the
country, always at a different place,
except for the first and last times, which
were at the mountain. It was like a
travelling seminar. . . . Sometimes at
hotels, sometimes at universities. Twice
we met at summer camps, and once at
a private estate in Virginia. We used
a business place in Pittsburgh, and
another in Poughkeepsie [New York],
. . . We never met in Washington, or
on Government property anywhere . . .
You said you made your own ground
rules. What were those ground rules?
The most important were informality
and unanimity. By informality I mean
that our discussions were open-ended.
We went as far afield as any one of us
thought we had to. For instance, we
spent a lot of time on the relationship
between military recruitment policies
and industrial employment. Before we
were finished with it, we’d gone through
the history of Western penal codes and
any number of comparative psychiatric
studies [of draftees and volunteers]. We
looked over the organisation of the
Inca Empire. We determined the effects
of automation on underdeveloped
societies. ... It was all relevant. . . .
By unanimity I don’t mean that we
kept taking votes, like a jury. I mean
that we stayed with every issue until we
had what the Quakers call a “sense of
the meeting. . . .”
Of course we had differences and big
ones, especially in the beginning. . . .
But you always reached agreement,
eventually?
Yes. It’s a unanimous report ... I
don’t mean that our sessions were
always harmonious. Some of them were
rough. The last six months there was a
lot of quibbling about small points . . .
We’d been under pressure for a long
time* we’d been working together too
long. It was natural . . . that we got
on each other’s nerves. For a while
Able and Taylor weren’t speaking to
each other. Miller threatened to quit.
But this all passed. There were no im-
portant differences . . .
How was the Report actually written?
Who did the writing?
We all had a hand in the first
draft. Jones and Able put it together,
and then mailed it around for review
before working out a final version . . .
The only problems were the form it
should take and whom we were writing
it for. And, of course, the question of
disclosure . . . [Doe’s comments on this
point are summarised in the introduc-
tion.]
You mentioned a “peace games”'
manual. What are peace games?
I wanted to say something about
that. The Report barely mentions it.
“Peace games” is a method we de-
veloped during the course of the study.
It’s a forecasting technique, an in-
formation system ... It will revolu-
tionise the study of social problems. It’s
a byproduct of the study. We needed a
fast, dependable procedure to approxi-
mate the effects of disparate social
phenomena on other social phenomena.
We got it. It’s in a primitive phase, but
it works.
How are peace games played? Are
they like Rand’s war games?
You don t “play” peace games like
chess or Monopoly, any more than you
play war games with toy soldiers. You
use computers. It’s a programming sys-
tem. A computer “language,” like Fort-
ran, or Algol, or Jovial . . . Its advan-
tage is its superior capacity to inter-
relate data with no apparent common
points of reference ... A simple anal-
ogy is likely to be misleading. But I can
give you some examples. For instance,
supposing I asked you to figure out
what effect a moon landing by U.S.
astronauts would have on an election
in, say, Sweden. Or what effect a
change in the draft law a specific
change would have on the value of
real estate in downtown Manhattan?
Or a certain change in college-entrance
requirements in the United States on
the British shipping industry?
You would probably say, first, that
there would be no effect to speak of,
and, second, that there would be no
way of telling. But you’d be wrong on
both counts. In each case there would
be an effect, and the peace games
method could tell you what it would
be, quantitatively. I didn’t take these
out of the air. We used them
in working out the method. . . . Essen-
tially, it’s an elaborate, high-speed trial-
and-error system for determining work-
ing algorithms. Like most sophisticated
types of computer problem-solving. . . .
We learned how to formulate the
problems accurately. It goes back to the
old saw: You can always find the
answer if you know the right question.
But with all due respect to the effects
of computer technology on modern
thinking, basic judgments must still be

THE REPORT OF
THE SPECIAL STUDY GROUP
Contrary to the decision of the
Special Study Group, of which I was a
member, I have arranged for the gen-
eral release of our Report. Responsibil-
ity for taking this step is mine and mine
alone.
I am well aware that my action may
be taken as a breach of faith by some
of my former colleagues. But in my
view my responsibility to the society of
which I am a part supersedes any self-
assumed obligation on the part of 15
individual men. Since our Report can
be considered on its merits, it is not
necessary for me to disclose their iden-
tity to accomplish my purpose. Yet I
would gladly abandon my own anonym-
ity if it were possible to do so without
at the same time compromising theirs,
to defend our work publicly if and
when they release me from this personal
bond.
But this is secondary. What is needed
now, and needed badly, is widespread
public discussion and debate about the
elements of war and the problems of
peace. I hope that publication of this
Report will serve to initiate it.

INTRODUCTION
The Report which follows summar-
ises the results of a two-and-a-half-year
study of the broad problems to be antici-
pated in the event of a general trans-
formation of American society to a
condition lacking its most critical cur-
rent characteristics: its capability and
readiness to make war when doing so
is judged necessary or desirable by its
political leadership.
Our work has been predicated on the
belief that some kind of general peace
may soon be negotiable. The de facto
admission of Communist China into the
United Nations now appears to be only
a few years away at most. It has be-
come increasingly manifest that con-
flicts of American national interest with
those of China and the Soviet Union
are susceptible of political solution,
despite the superficial contraindications
of the current Vietnam war, of the
threats of an attack on China, and of
the necessarily hostile tenor of day-to-
day foreign-policy statements. It is also
obvious that differences involving other
nations can be readily resolved by the
three great powers whenever they arrive
at a stable peace among themselves. It
is not necessary, for the purposes of
our study, to assume that a general
detente of this sort will come about —
and we make no such argument —but
only that it may.
It is surely no exaggeration to say
that a condition of general world peace
would lead to changes in the social
structures of the nations of the world
of unparalleled and revolutionary mag-
nitude. The economic impact of general
disarmament, to name only the most
obvious consequence of peace, would
revise the production and distribution
patterns of the globe to a degree that
would make the changes of the past 50
years seem insignificant. Political, socio-
logical, cultural, and ecological changes
would be equally far-reaching. What
has motivated our study of these con-
tingencies has been the growing sense
of thoughtful men, in and out of gov-
ernment, that the world is totally un-
prepared to meet the demands of such
a situation.
We had originally planned, when our
study was initiated, to address ourselves
to these two broad questions and their
components:
What can be expected if peace
comes? What should we be prepared
to do about it?
BUT AS OUR investigation proceeded,
it became apparent that certain other
questions had to be faced. What, for
instance, are the real functions of war
in modern societies, beyond the osten-
sible ones of defending and advancing
the “national interests” of nations?
Granting that a “peaceful” settlement
of disputes is within the range of cur-
rent international relationships, is the
abolition of war, in the broad sense,
really possible? If so, is it necessarily
desirable, in terms of social stability?
The word peace, as we have used it
in the following pages, describes a per-
manent, or quasi-permanent, condition
entirely free from the national exercise,
or contemplation, of any form of the
organised social violence, or threat of
violence, generally known as war. It
implies total and general disarmament.
It is not used to describe the more
familiar condition of “cold war,”
“armed peace,” or other mere respite,
long or short, from armed conflict. Nor
is it used simply as a synonym for the
political settlement of international dif-
ferences. The magnitude of modern
means of mass destruction, and the speed
of modern communications, require the
unqualified working definition given
above; only a generation ago such an
absolute description would have seemed
utopian rather than pragmatic. Today,
any modification of this definition would
render it almost worthless for our pur-
pose. By the same standard, we have
used the word war to apply interchange-
ably to conventional (“hot”) war, to
the general condition of war prepara-
tion or war readiness, and to the general
“war system.” The sense intended is
made clear in context.
SCOPE OF THE STUDY
When the Special Study Group was
established in August, 1963, its members
were instructed to govern their delib-
erations in accordance with three princi-
pal criteria. Briefly stated, they were
these: military-style objectivity; avoid-
ance of preconceived value assumptions;
inclusion of all relevant areas of theory
and data.
These guideposts are by no means as
obvious as they may appear at first
glance, and we believe it necessary to
indicate clearly how they were to inform
our work. For they express succinctly
the limitations of previous “peace
studies,” and imply the nature of both
government and unofficial, dissatisfac-
tion with these earlier efforts. It is not
our intention here to minimise the
significance of the work of our prede-
cessors, or to belittle the quality of their
contributions. What we have tried to do
(and believe we have done) is extend
their scope.
It is a truism that objectivity is more
often an intention expressed than an
attitude achieved, but the intention —-
conscious, unambiguous, and constantly
self-critical —is a precondition to its
achievement. We believe it no accident
that we were charged to use a “mili-
tary contingency” model for our study,
and we owe a considerable debt to the
civilian war planning agencies for their
pioneering work in the objective exam-
ination of the contingencies of nuclear
war. There is no such precedent in
peace studies. Much of the usefulness
of even the most elaborate and care-
fully reasoned programs for economic
conversion to peace, for example, has
been vitiated by a wishful eagerness
to demonstrate that peace is not only
possible but even cheap or easy. One
official report is replete with references
to the critical role of “dynamic optim-
ism” on economic developments, and
goes on to submit, as evidence, that it
“would be hard to imagine that the
American people would not respond
very positively to an agreed and safe-
guarded program to substitute an inter-
national rule of law and order,” etc.
Yet genuine objectivity in war studies
is often criticised as inhuman. As
Herman Kahn, the writer on strategic
studies best known to the genei'al pub-
lic, put it: “Critics frequently refer to
the icy rationality of the Hudson In-
stitute, the Rand Corporation, and
other such organisations. I’m always
tempted to ask in reply, ‘Would you
prefer a warm, human error? Do you
feel better with a nice emotional mis-
take?’ ” And, as Secretary of Defence
Robert S. McNamara has pointed out,
“Some people are afraid even to look
over the edge. But in a thermonuclear
world we cannot afford any political
acrophobia.” Surely it should be self-
evident that this applies equally to the
opposite prospect, but so far no one
has taken more than a timid glance
over the brink of peace.
An intention to avoid preconceived
value judgments is if anything even
more productive of self-delusion. Pre-
vious studies have taken the desirability
of peace, the importance of human life,
the superiority of democratic institu-
tions, the greatest “good” for the great-
est number, the “dignity” of the in-
dividual, the desirability of maximum
health and longevity, and other such
wishful premises as axiomatic values
necessary for the justification' of a
study of peace issues. We have not
found them so.

The more clothes you took off, the more free you became. Now you can
also achieve freedom by putting clothes on (if they are old enough), or
even by putting hair on (if you have enough).

Two examples
of partial
taking-off
A compromiser, half-off, half-on
Nation of contrasts


OVERSEAS What’s coming up in 1968?
Whichever way Hanoi turns,
it may find trouble
TO LET things simmer. Or to bring
them up to the boil. That is the
main decision for the Hanoi Govern-
ment to make in its conduct of the
war in Vietnam in the coming year.
And it will make its decision on the
basis of its own guesses about what the
effect will be in relation to the Ameri-
can presidential election. As with the
Americans themselves, so with the
North Vietnamese, next year’s presi-
dential election becomes part of the
war.
As background to Hanoi’s decision
there is the fact that, in terms of last-
ing it out, the Americans have the
advantage. The Americans’ problems
are those of their own internal politics
and national morale. In this respect
Hanoi has the advantage: there is no
sign of political disunity; national
morale can be enforced (and it may
have been increased by the bombing).
But, so far as the attritional side of
the war goes, the Americans are slowly
winning.
The “pacification” program is begin-
ning to work in bits and pieces, parti-
cularly in the more heavily populated
areas, the strength of the National
Liberation Front forces is diminishing.
And although it seems likely that Rus-
sian and Chinese supplies come in at a
rate higher than the rate at which the
Americans destroy what arrives, the
demands on North Vietnamese man-
power could slowly force North Viet-
nam into a more conciliatory mood.
As well as the regular units it has in
the South, there are huge demands for
air defence in the North; in addition,
half a million or so men are needed
to keep the supply system running.
One possibility is that Hanoi will de-
escalate, to take the pressure off its own
society. Pull its troops out of South
Vietnam. Try somehow to force the
Americans into a situation in which
for internal or international political
reasons they cut down on the bombing,
or cut it out altogether. This could be
an attractive policy. If the war were
left on the side of the stove as a
local guerilla action it could stay warm
for years. American patience or interest
might some day evaporate. Hanoi
might win by a finesse.
What is wrong with this theory is
that it does not allow for the continu-
ing cockiness in Hanoi. The closely
knit North Vietnamese ruling group
probably still believe they can humi-
liate the Americans in an obvious
defeat as they humiliated the French.
The most significant military develop-
ment this year—the conventional
battles at Dak To and Loc Ninh
suggests that, far from a policy of sim-
mering down, General Giap may now
favor a policy of making the war
hotter, even if, as at Dak To, it risks
a casualty rate of up to 40 percent.
The interpretation offered for this
move makes two assumptions. One is
that, by drawing the Americans into
border battles, the rate of “pacifica-
tion” elsewhere can be slowed down, or
even reversed, so that the “real war”
can still be won. The other is that,
by killing more Americans, the North
Vietnamese can increase the anti-war
feeling in America so that it finally
becomes decisive.
Both of these are real possibilities.
But there are also possible dangers for
the North Vietnamese in such a
strategy. The Americans have almost
total mobility. They can be here today
and somewhere else tomorrow. It is
possible for them to react to a new
strategy in a way that would not
greatly hinder the “pacification” pro-
gram, or perhaps not hinder it at all.
Even worse for the North Vietnamese
they may go on losing set-piece
battles. If the real pressure on them is
the pressure on their manpower, they
cannot afford a series of Dak Tos.
They might keep up for a while, but
the drain could put them in a very weak
position after the presidential elec-
tions. Nor does their sketchy supply
system give them the flexibility needed
for successful actions of this kind. And
a series of obvious defeats would have
unpredictable effects on a regime still
built on the pride of Dien Bien Phu.
At the same time it would give Presi-
dent Johnson a splendid opportunity to
say that America was winnnig.
There is another factor. Just as it is
possible that the American bombing
of North Vietnam may have increased
North Vietnamese morale it is also pos-
sible that a higher American casualty
rate would also increase American
morale. The American criticisms of
America’s participation in the Vietnam
war are not primarily those of ex-
pediency, but those of conscience. They
are also those of confusion about an
unfamiliar situation. There would be
nothing like a series of set-piece battles
to make the situation quite familiar.
Especially if the Americans won most
of them.
Our neighbors
An ersatz Britain?
FOR AUSTRALIA, by far the best
international news of the year came
from our nearest neighbors. The final
supplanting of Sukarno in Indonesia
and the pragmatic approach of the
Suharto Government meant that a
whole range of fears became unfashion-
able. Instead of living next to one of
the most openly chauvinist governments
in the world, we now live next to a
Boots of Americans killed in the Dak To battle lined up at a memorial service
after the bloodiest—and most significant—fighting of the year in Vietnam


Suharto . . . has many terrible problems
government that is beginning the
immense task of trying to make some
sense of its economic affairs and that
is showing some signs of interest in
regional co-operation.
Many terrible problems still confront
this Government. The cleaning up of
the economic wreckage that Sukarno’s
adventurism caused will take several
more years and the more intractable
problems of raising general living
standards sometimes seem beyond con-
ventional wisdom. The fate of the
Chinese minority is still a matter of
bloodthirsty speculation, as is the fate
of the new Government itself. But it
is one of those encouraging revelations
of human commonsense that out of the
bombast of the Sukarno regime there
came the sober pragmatism of his suc-
cessors.
For Australians the prospects of a
sense of peaceful neighborliness with
Indonesia seemed to appeal to the
imaginations more of the practical men
than the men of ideas. A group of
businessmen was formed to study the
economic problems of Indonesia. The
RSL contacted veterans among the
generation of freedom fighters. But
Australian intellectuals seemed to go
off Indonesia a bit now that it had
become more friendly and the Govern-
ment entirely failed to make any ges-
tures of brotherhood. A long holding
game by the Treasury meant that Aus-
tralian special economic assistance, in-
stead of being the first thrown into the
hat, was the last, and was in any case
too little. Although Mr. Holt had
visited Singapore, Malaysia, Laos,
Cambodia, South Vietnam, the Philip-
pines, Taiwan, and South Korea he
did not visit Indonesia.
The event that captured most atten-
tion in the area was the official con-
firmation by the British of what was
obvious that they were going to
pull out of Singapore and Malaysia.
In Australia this has not yet produced
any definite response. There are those
who see Australia “replacing the
British.” (But what with?) There are
those who urge an Australian pull-out,
as a preliminary to a disengagement
from South-East Asia —and those who
look forward to the development of
forms of regional co-operation (but
not as any Australian initiative.)
The first initiative came from the
area itself, in the useful meeting be-
tween representatives of Indonesia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and
Thailand. What seems necessary in the
new year is that these nations should
look for some at least minor forms of
co-operation, as a kind of try-out of
something that might be more signi-
ficant. Immediate major results should
not be expected. Both the confronta-
tion between Indonesia and Malaysia-
Singapore and the separation of Sing-
apore and Malaysia have left uncer-
tainties of relationship; and while the
Philippines sees itself as part of the
area, the Thais have traditionally
looked more to the mainland of South-
East Asia than to the Malayan penin-
sula and the hundreds of islands that
make up the Malay Archipelago.
In Singapore, the reactions to the
British pull-out have been expressions
of rugged determination to survive;
from Malaysia there have been con-
tinuing requests for a conference be-
tween Malaysia, Singapore, Britain,
Australia, and New Zealand. Australia
has been stalling: the Australian Gov-
ernment wished to go further with its
defence review so that it would have
something to say at the conference. It
has also been anxious not to act merely
as a kind of ersatz Britain. It has had
an eye on Indonesia, and rightly, since
its interest in the area is not that of a
former British colony, but of a nation
that itself is part of the area, still exist-
ing in it no matter how faint becomes
the British strategic connection.
Among those in Australia who urge
caution about entering into specific
commitments to Singapore and Malay-
sia some do so only from a desire for
a general commitment to the area
rather than a commitment to only two
nations in it; others do so because they
urge a general withdrawal from the
area. It may be from the settlement
of this difference that we shall learn
what kind of a nation Australia is
likely to be in the future.
Britain
Ruinous conceit
THE DESIRE for prestige has been
the ruinous addiction of all British Gov-
ernments since World War 11. Prime
Minister after Prime Minister has his
eye on some particular “world role”
in which Britain can still seem self-
important: in turn, each attempt to
play such a role fails. The best that
Wilson . . . private assurances broken
can. be said of 1967 is that some of the
possible roles seemed to be eliminated
altogether and the credibility of others
seemed so weakened that for 1968 the
choice has been narrowed, although,
not surprisingly, the remaining “choice”
may not be attainable.
The role of Britain, the leading Com-
monwealth country, was pretty well out
of the repertoire before 1967 began,
with “Rhodesia” engraved on its heart.
It is unlikely that the British will be
game to call another Commonwealth
Conference with the Rhodesia issue un-
settled, nor does a settlement seem
likely. With its single-centred pursuit
of Common Market entry, the Labor
Government, most of whose members a
few years ago saw themselves as Com-
monwealth men, now sees itself as
“European.” The idea of the Common-
wealth is still there, in case British
conceit needs some new prop, but it
may be unusable in its present state.
In the meantime, it is forgotten.
The role of Britain the World Power,
unconvincing to all except the nostalgic
since 1956, gained further incredibility
from the attempts of Mr. Brown and
Mr. Wilson to get into the act during
this year’s Middle East crisis. There
were flights to world capitals and states-
manlike speeches, but the symbol of
these episodes was that when Mr.
Wilson visited the White House, by
accident they hung the Union Jack
upside down. Just as Sir Anthony Eden
gave up his Suez adventure when the
Americans told him they wouldn’t back
sterling if there was a run on it, Mr.
Wilson suddenly realised that Britain
couldn’t afford a role in the Israel-
Arab war.
Of more lasting significance in the
abandonment of the world power role
was the announcement of the pull-out
from Malaysia and Singapore. It was
Mr. Wilson who made the most out of
the “East-of-Suez” policy when it was


convenient for him to do so. If he
had not made such a flap earlier about
how Britain was going to stay he may
not have seemed so perfidious when he
later announced that Britain was going
to go. That the British would at least
considerably reduce their Malaysia-
Singapove commitments was obvious as
soon as Sukarno’s confrontation ended;
what was not obvious was the need to
announce full departure so far in ad-
vance, and without any knowledge of
what the situation might be when the
final evacuation was timed to occur.
Mr. Wilson did this because it suited
his political ends he wanted to throw
a sop to his Left Wing. As it happened
British “public opinion” (viz., the
opinions of a few coteries in London)
seemed largely indifferent to whether
Britain came or went. What seems
most likely in 1968 is an acceleration
of departure.
The year’s further abandonment of
the role of Britain the World Power
was also associated with a further for-
getting of lines in playing the role of
Britain, America’s Special Relation. The
declaration of a decline of interest in
South-East Asia was not the act of a
“special relation.” Indeed, there was
increasing confusion about what the
“special relationship” was supposed to
be. This was not merely a matter of
attitudes about Vietnam: it may have
reflected some of that increasing bitter-
ness of some members of the British
elite about the importance of America,
a bitterness that was already strong by
D-Day in 1944. Mr. Holt seemed to be
a more significant visitor to the White
House than Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Wilson went on desperately
playing the role of Britain the World
Banker, but, like John Osborne’s “En-
tertainer,” he lost attention of his
audience. With that desire to play up
to the conceit of London that made
him first march east of Suez and then
march back west again, he stuck by
sterling as if it were the Union Jack,
only to find himself later lowering the
flag. His long delay in doing so —it
could be argued that sterling might
better have been devalued in 1964
meant that he was forced to make
many private assurances to other
national leaders (ours included), and
now they are all broken. In the new
year it will become clearer whether
sterling still has any future as a world
currency or whether the City’s long-
standing greed will finally be denied,
and Britain will enter into businesslike
arrangements with what is left of “the
sterling area,” with a view to shutting
up shop.
The great big role left was that of
Britain the True European, but this
was savagely contested by de Gaulle,
doing all he could to block the proposed
Common Market entry. As impelled by
old national pride as the British, de
Gaulle was better at satisfying it,
strengthened as he was by a simpler
definition of purpose. Prompted more
by political considerations than eco-
nomic, Mr. Wilson seems determined to
go on pushing at Europe until its door
is slammed in his face or until the
house falls down. After that he will,
no doubt, find some other role to play.
United States
In a wicked world
IN 1968 Americans will continue to
agonise about that intractability of
problems that challenge their belief
that anything is possible. The two
principal fields from which they will
draw their metaphors of this particular
affront to the contemporary mind will
be the Vietnam war abroad and the
Negro problem at home.
In the case of the Negroes, nothing
is likely to happen that will ease the
Americans’ dilemma. At the most ex-
treme there could be an intensification
of violence that might appear to re-
define the problem in more familiar
terms, but this is no solution.
In the case of Vietnam, the more
conventional the war looks, the easier
it becomes for Americans to imagine
what they are fighting for. But how
conventional the war is to be is mainly
a matter that Hanoi will decide. It is
almost impossible to imagine that the
proud men of Hanoi will have enough
guile to let the war reach that quiescent
stage in which a let’s-sign-a-treaty
candidate could win nomination for
the American presidency. Unless there
is some such turn of events, President
Johnson looks pretty safe for Demo-
cratic nomination. Who gets the Repub-
lican nomination depends on whether
that party can overcome its almost ir-
resistible desire to back a loser: it
seems unlikely to pick a peace-at-any-
price man, but can it pick someone who
would really look more likely than
Johnson to bring the war to some-
thing approaching a successful con-
clusion? If it were not for the war,
prediction would be easier. The candi-
date who seemed most likely to win
would be the one who seemed most like
President Kennedy. This would seem
.to rule out Senator Bobby Kennedy,
One thing to look for next year
would be signs of a greater return to
isolationism. The disappointments of
Vietnam and the anti-Americanisms of
Europe are both matters that Ameri-
cans may not endure for ever with
patience. Congress is already making
economic assistance to under-
developed nations more and more dif-
ficult and, in trade, organised protec-
tionist sentiment is making a new
outbreak. Senator Everett M. Dirksen
has a tough battle-line of Congressmen
he will send back into the fray in
1968. Faced with a world that to
Americans can seem mainly thankless,
his case for higher import duties and
wider import quotas can seem psycho-
logically convincing, although the
Administration can be trusted to appeal
to the sophistication of American big
business itself, which understands that
its continuing expansion (particularly
in Europe) depends on freedom of
economic movement and that Ameri-
can protectionism would be met with
retaliations that could cripple Ameri-
can exports and overseas investment.
French attacks on the dollar will
certainly assist the revival of American
belief in the wickedness of the outside
world. In one sense President de Gaulle
is using his international monetary
policy as a form of warfare against
the Americans, as he is using general
diplomatic and economic policy as a
form of warfare against the British.
But another form of disillusion may
come from the British: there now seems
to be developing in Britain a glorifica-
tion of self interest that, makes any
desperate measure seem an honorable
one, because it gives a passing relief
to some British political problem. As
Britain drops its remaining bundles,
this leaves more for the Americans to
worry about: and in 1968 the British
might do anything back out of their
arms deals with America, trade with
Cuba or North Vietnam, butt into
Latin America. It is even possible
that, desperate to find his next act,
Mr. Wilson might try directly to
exploit anti-American sentiment.
With such possibilities as these in
view it might seem more necessary
than ever for those Australians who
value the American alliance (and this
seems to be most Australians) to
recognise the fact that certain types
of independent action now seem one
of the most attractive ways of attract-
ing American friendship. For Austra-
lia to play a much more active role
in its own region may be as important
as sending battalions to Vietnam. The
Senator Dirksen ... a tough battle line


American problem is to reduce the
number of things America has to
worry about. In future the Americans’
best friends may be those who rely
on them least.
Russia
The blue —and red
—Mediterranean
THE MILLION square miles of water
of the Mediterranean is no longer a
western lake. The big grey warships
that ride at anchor on the horizon are
as likely to be flying the Russian as the
American or British flag. The Russians
no\£ have 40 or 50 naval vessels of the
most advanced design in Mediterranean
waters, thereby at last fulfilling that
ambition of moving into the Mediter-
ranean that first began to inspire Rus-
sians at the beginning of the 18th cen-
tury. They have at their disposal the
ports of their friends in North Africa,
whom they have also armed with highly
sophisticated naval weapons which, in
at least the case of the sinking of the
Israeli destroyer Eilat, their friends
seem to be trained to use. With the
world’s largest fleet of submarines (400,
twice the American total), the world’s
second largest navy, and the world’s
third largest merchant navy, the Rus-
sians have rounded out their claim to
world power.
Now that the Russians have devel-
oped a friendship with Turkey, all the
States of the eastern Mediterranean,
except Israel, are hospitable to them.
Syria, Egypt, and Algeria have between
them received more Soviet military
equipment than North Vietnam did in
the past year. Although the Arabs were
defeated in the Six-Day War, this was
no defeat of Russian influence in the
Middle East. On the contrary. Their
strength in the Middle East has been
strengthened by the Israeli success. The
feeling in NATO headquarters is that
Russia might be getting ready to play
a new game of brinkmanship in this
part of the world, but the more hopeful
see the present displays of Russian
strength as a tactical move in a general
strategy of detente.
Thus Russia celebrated the 50th
year of the Revolution mainly by its
success as a conventional great power.
The Revolution may have failed in
opening up unimagined freedoms for
the workers, but at least the Russians
were now strong in the Mediterranean
(as well as being one of the world’s
first two superpowers). Nor can there
be confidence in a continuation of post-
Cuba caution. The Russians played a
tough game in the Middle East last
year, and they might again risk tough-
ness next year. In the present Russian
Government there are still tensions and
forces pushing and straining in all pos-
sible directions. And it is not forgotten
that although American interest in a
detente may have led to some of the
present French intransigence, there is
no doubt that Russian interest in a
detente accentuated the Sino-Soviet
split.
The Russians still speak the ideology
of revolution and they still want to
play the leading role among the
world’s Communists. If a communist-
led coup breaks out somewhere, or if
there is some new war of “national
liberation,” it would be hard for the
Russians not to answer pleas for help
against an American intervention. If
you preach proletarian solidarity for 50
years some people are going to go on
believing it.
At present, after so many months of
doubt, it looks as if the Russians are
now summoning up the nerve to hold
another world communist conference.
Proceedings begin with the meeting of
18 parties in Budapest, and now that
the number of parties which are com-
mitted to an international conference
has grown from 40 to more than 65
it looks as if the conference might
really be on next year, unless the Rus-
sians go back to their more cautious
thinking on this subject, in which they
realised that since the movement is now
split into three parts a conference was
more likely to prove a confession, of
weakness than a declaration of strength.
Perhaps the world communist move-
ment is like the Commonwealth of
Nations: it can only continue to appear
to exist so long as it doesn’t meet.

Japan
Going international
WHEN JAPAN began the year with
the “black mist” elections the charges
of corruption that enveloped the elec-
tion campaign seemed to some Japan-
ese to raise doubts about their ability
to combine representative and efficient
government. But the elections did not
result in the mess that was anticipated:
Mr. Sato’s victory has resulted in a
strong government that, at least in the
international field, has acted with more
confidence than any Japanese Govern-
ment since the war.
Mr. Sato dramatised the new inter-
est in a diplomatic role befitting
Japan’s industrial power by visiting no
less than 13 countries during the year.
His Government took such initiative as
unofficial chairman of the “Aid Indo-

nesia Club” that Japan alone now
provides one-third of Indonesia’s
foreign aid, and while there is not yet
any long-range definition of the Japan-
ese style in approaching the question
of economic assistance to Asian coun-
tries there possibly could be one in
1968. There seems to be no doubt
that the Japanese Government is deter-
mined to resume an international role
in at least this limited by accept-
ing certain economic responsibilities in
Asia. This is particularly gratifying
to the Americans, to whom the new
Japanese interest may more than com-
pensate for the declining interest of
the British.
The surprise of the year the
vigor wuth which Mr. Sato came out
on the American side in Vietnam,
thereby risking in his own country the
kind of opposition that has beset
President Johnson in America only
more so. His attitudes came partly
from conviction, but also from the re-
assurance he has received in his visits
to Asian countries that there is among
political leaders in all those countries,
even the most unlikely, a private dis-
taste for the idea of an abrupt Ameri-
can pull-out from Vietnam; this pri-
vately expressed feeling is one of the
best-known secrets in South-East Asia,
whose leaders say one lot of things
publicly on Vietnam and a rather dif-
ferent lot privately.
Mr. Sato’s open support for the
Americans in the Vietnam war in-
furiated Peking, as did his visits to
Taiwan. The drift in relations be-
tween Peking and Tokyo was made
even worse by the tension between the
Japanese and Chinese Communist
Parties in w'hich the Japanese Com-
munist Party is now attacking the
Chinese Communists as Trotskyists,
anti-revolutionaries, extreme Left tem-
porisers, and vicious criminals. None
of this could have happened at a worse
time. The private trade agreement be-
tween Japan and China expires at the
end of the year and it has been on
the basis of this agreement that trade
with China has been flourishing. There
is, however, no sign that Japan will
adopt an American attitude toward
trade with China.
Mr. Sato has been unsuccessful in
securing any significant American
promise about Okinawa. President
Johnson offered a few polite but
Okinawa goes on looking like the
American base it has been since World
War 11. Nor have negotiations with
Russia yet achieved anything so far as
Japan’s demand for the return of the
Kurile Islands is concerned.
As with other trading nations, but
most obviously with Japan, the new
outbreak of protectionism in the
American Congress could strain rela-
tions with America next year. A third
of all Japan’s exports go to America,
and the protectionist Bills now in
Congress, if passed, could have a
devastating effect. However, the Japan-
ese Government is confident that these
measures will be stifled by the inter-
vention of the American administra-
tion and of American big business
itself, which is believed to recognise
that countries like Japan, Britain, and
Germany would engage in a thorough-
going retaliation if Congress were un-
wise enough to go as protectionist a*
it sometimes talks.
China
Reluctant cadres
HAVING TOSSED out so many of his
old supporters during the Cultural
Revolution, Mao’s regime now seems
to be trying to put some of them back
into positions of responsibility. The
alternative was a policy of permanent
economic and civil disorder. It is
exactly this alternative that the young
revolutionaries of the Cultural Revolu-
tion seem to prefer. They are resisting
attempts at rehabilitation of the old
cadres and attacking it as an example
of the Counter Revolution Betrayed. At
the same time, some of the old cadres
are not all that anxious to go back into
the party firing-line again. They are
submitting to their “re-education,” but
with expresisons of emotional insecurity
that are understandable.
Which of these two forces comes out
on top next year? The forces of excite-
ment and anarchy, or the forces of
orthodoxy and order? To this question
one must also add some questions about
the Army. Will the soldiers who see
themselves as professional military men
win? Or the soldiers who see themselves
as professors in the doctrine of Mao?
Or the soldiers who would like to see
someone actually again set about the
job of running the country?
There may be no clear answers.
China’s convulsions are not likely to
cease. The past year has shown how
deep and long-lasting have been the
tensions between the top people of
China and how the Maoists are only
one force amongst others. The Cultural
Revolution was not only an attempt to
recover the simplicity of Mao’s lost
ideological youth; it was also a breaking
out into the open of all the unresolved
questions of who holds the power in
China.
With these domestic uncertainties,
who can speak with any confidence in
predicting China’s external role in the
next year? All that one can say is that
it is likely to jump about wuth a degree
of unpredictability unimaginable in
any other nation in the w'orld.


BUSINESS What’s coming up in 1968?
A year of expectation, but
not much achievement
IT’S GOING TO BE a dull year. At
least in comparison wdth 1967. Yes,
there’ll be some fairly exciting things
happening: strikes over the implica-
tions of the new metal trades awards;
more oil finds; a growing shortage of
money; an improvement in most of
the indicators of economic growth;
more ups and downs in nickel; a serious
run-down in our foreign exchange
reserves and, w'ith average luck, a
pretty heavy-looking stockmarket for
most of the year.
There are lots of good times coming
in the future, but very few of them
wall take place in 1968. True, the rate
of iron-ore shipments will rise con-
siderably, and so will oil production
from Barrow r Island, Australia’s big-
gest producing oilfield. But it will still
be a few years before the really big
increases in mineral and oil produc-
tion take place that wall make such
changes in Australia’s prosperity. So
they will not help us out of the im-
mediate problems set by the fact that
our rural exports will be suffering
from a combination of drought, poor
commodity prices, and British devalua-
tion.
Only a part of our nickel potential
will have been tapped by the end of
1968; our big iron-ore developments
at Mt. Newman and Robe River wall
not have begun to add to the existing
operations from Hamersley, Mt.
Goldsworthy, Savage River, and BHP;
the big future for uranium forecast
for the early 1970 s will still be years
away; the Bass Strait wells, expected
to be providing a quarter of our oil
requirements by 1970, will still be only
in a development stage next December.
So the business scene in 1968 will
probably be made up of grey colorless
stuff compared w'ith the excitement of
1967. The massive new mineral and
oil discoveries, the 40 percent jump hr
the stockmarket (the biggest yearly
rise this century according to the Syd-
ney share price index), Britain’s de-
valuation, the turmoil at the Tariff
Board, the drought in southern Aus-
tralia, the McEwen-McMahon warfare
(reflected in the disagreements between
the Departments of Trade and
Treasury on economic policy), and all
the rest of 1967’s big news combined to
make it one of the most remarkable
in our history.
Yet it w'as set against a background
of a generally unimpressive rate of
advance in general economic activity,
an only modest rise in company
profits, a very small increase in con-
sumer demand, a disturbing fall in the
rate of new capital expenditure by
private business and a continuing fall
in our overseas reserves as exports
failed to meet the import demand
generated by even such a moderate
rate of economic development as we
achieved last year. There is little
prospect of this pace hotting up in
1968; money gives every promise of
getting in short supply even to meet
the sort of demand for it prompted by
the current level of business activity,
so liquidity shortages could hold the
economy back a little even if business-
men did want to rush ahead.
Even if there were plenty of cash
available, official concern with the bal-
ance of payments would no doubt
prompt governmental action against a
very high level of spending on every-
thing, including new plant and equip-
ment, a large proportion of which is
bought overseas.
But so far businessmen have given
little indication of being greatly en-
thused by prospects for the short-term
future; the latest Associated Chamber
of Manufactures of Australia - Bank
of N.S.W. survey of business expecta-
tions shows a clear fall in their
optimism about expanding production.
They said that stocks of both finished
goods and raw materials rose in the
last quarter and they expect a decline
in the current rate of overtime being
worked. This follows the recent official
news about an actual fall in new
private capital investment in the three
months to September for the fourth
consecutive quarter. The clear evidence
that there has been very little capital
raisings on the stock exchanges during
the three months to December is prob-
ably a pretty good guide to the general
trend. It looks certain then that the
Commonwealth Statistician’s survey
forecast of a percent rise in private
investment in the December half-year
of 1967 has not been realised.
So Mr. McMahon’s much-vaunted
strategy, of encouraging private capital
investment while discouraging what had
been the much faster growth of public
spending, clearly has not worked. For
despite the two percent fall in the
private sector, total fixed capital
expenditure in fact rose by two percent
in September quarter because of the
continuing rise in public sector spend-
ing. And there are few signs that this
situation is changing.
Some new capital raisings are to take
place in the main, it seems, in the
most ill-liquid period of the year; money
will be scooped out of the market at
a fast rate just w'hen a normal seasonal
shortage of cash would have been
restricting the level of share buying in
any event (and wfith this year’s drought,
the lack of funds in March could be
exacerbated). Add to this the risk
that foreign capital may well not be
flowing in at anything like the rate of
this year, and a situation seems likely
to emerge of a severe cut in the de-
mand for shares coupled with an
increase in the supply of new shares
Mt. Tom .‘rice . . . the stockpile
and rights. And market prices are
functions of supply and demand.
Of course, the continuing uncertainty
about Britain’s future raises some
clouds about prospects for our trading
relations in 1968, just as continued
attacks on the U.S. dollar and mount-
ing demand for gold raise similar
problems. But the key country to look
at in 1968 is Japan. If the Japanese
growth rate stumbles, it is Australia
that will fall flat on its face. Our pros-
perity is increasingly geared to Japan.
The latest moves to find some way
of offsetting the devaluation impact on
Australian exports, both primary and
secondary, are unlikely to provide any
real boost to the economy; they are
aimed at holding the position pre-
devaluation, not improving on it.
So, all in all, 1968 is going to be
an uncomfortable, intermediate sort of
year for business, with our expectations,
more than our achievements, being our
most cheerful companions.


THE YEAR BRIEFLY
FOr the economy : The economy was subdued by
disastrous Hobart fires, widespread drought in western
N.S.W. and Victoria, sterling and N.Z. devaluations, but
its underlying strength, reinforced by minerals discoveries
and exploitation, was obvious.
The 1967-68 Budget estimated expenditure and receipts
nine percent higher, provided for 18 percent greater defence
spending and higher postal charges . . . Australia borrowed
from the Export-Import Bank of America and for the
first time from Germany . . . Capital expenditure was
cautious, but consumer spending was buoyant enough.
The eight local trading banks formed an Australian
Resources Development Bank to finance development of
local resources . . . There was a strong growth in bank
deposits . . . There was a continuous fall in registered
vacancies in the labor market . . . International reserves
fell, too.
Wool prices weakened, especially for coarse wools, and
quality was affected by the drought . . . The European-U.K.
Shipping Conference decided to increase freights after
devaluation by 12J percent and were threatened by Mr.
McEwen . . . Restrictive trade practices legislation became
law in September.
For the markets : Dominated by that volatile yet
well-founded oil stock BHP, and the king of nickel, Western
Mining, Australian share markets appeared to stage an
unprecendented advance throughout most of 1967; ancillary
stimulus was often provided by ghosts and whispers of
nickel (the metal of the year?), which allowed some hectic
progress to be based on prospects rather than performance.
Drought and devaluation tended to cast a temporary pall
toward the year’s close, so that volumes also were heavily
reduced. The special foci of interest could not conceal (or
should not be allowed to conceal) that the body of second-
line industrials had to endure a considerable lack of inter-
est; for many investors, however, the old art of selection
paid off well.
Devaluation came to climax a year in which London
tended, by and large, to ignore major outside economic
influences, and a series of bad trade and balance-of-payments
statistics applying to Britain itself; equities, therefore,
remained fairly sound on the ancient thought that they
are the safest harbor for money in an inflation . . . Wall
Street hasn’t managed to get anywhere near the peak estab-
lished early in 1966; its own devaluation jump faded,
although high-volume trading, especially characteristic of
the year’s end, held toward the close.
For companies: Bonny new arrivals: Hamersley,
Kiwi, Cudgen RZ, Mining Traders, Mineral Deposits, and
Cockburn Cement provided handsome baby bonuses for
lucky stags, and encouragement to all investors.
Wed: F. J. Palmer to Buckinghams, obscuring the maiden
name of Palmer, with its unfortunate confusions; TNT
and Alltrans, by reverse technique to beat exchange control
authorities; Associated Leathers and J. Bayley, both in
leather; Mt. Morgan and Peko, to beat the unwelcome
attentions of Power of the U.S.
Spurned: Viyella of U.K. by Davies Coop, Guest Keen
and Nettlefold also of Britain, by Brown and Dureau . . .
There began a scuffle for the Australia Hotel.
Adoptions: Golden Poultry Farming by Inghams, willing
to share financial responsibility with AP and D, the British
Tobacco part - subsidiary which was the most acquisitive
company in 1967, adopting Toppa, Devondale Cream, and
Fibre Containers, the latter by reverse technique through
Dodge; Macßobertson by Cadbury-Fry-Pascall against
opposition from Mars; and Hoadleys by James Stedmans,
although Life Savers was the original contender; Whale
Industries by Dalgety-N.Z. Loan.
Fosterings: Philips Electrical bought into Eric Anderson,
Associated Maltsters into Smith Mitchell.
Ailing: Anderson Meat asked for a receiver, lost $861,000.
Reborn: Out of Cox Bros, demise, Georges Ltd.
Investigated: Savoy Corporation (directors slated) and
Cox Bros., reports on both of which were tabled in the
Victorian Legislative Assembly.
H. G. Palmer losses continued; about s4om. of public
money has now been lost, but debenture holders have now
received 35c of their expected 86c in the $.
Troubled: Anthony Hordern made a tiny profit after a
series of losses.
Industrial events: Concrete Industries received its first
cash settlement on claims against the U.S. Navy for work
on the North-West Cape . . . TV Corporation became a
subsidiary of Consolidated Press . . . Marrickville lost a
battle to lift or get rid of margarine quotas . . . GM-H’s
profit went down on higher sales; in has conceived $ 12.5 m.
plans to make its own automatic transmissions . . . Alcan
allowed Australian institutions to subscribe to 30 percent
of equity capital.
ACl’s expectations of equalling 1966-67 record profit
in 1967-68 were dampened by N.Z. devaluation, but it
plans to raise capital in 1968 for computer installation,
upgrading of production facilities, and to broaden its base
. . . The brewers’ profits were transfused by beer price
rises; Tooth continued its annual dividend increments;
demand for Carlton and United shares withered at the
thought of Courage’s impending entry, but profits rose t057.5m.,
$7.5m., and Ballarat Brewing made a one-for-three bonus
after revaluing its holding of CUB ‘Z’ shares . . . Behind
the tariff barrier, ICIANZ prospered with evident improved
efficiencies and plant use; profit was a record $10.6m., up
12 percent, although drought did not help fertiliser interests-
. . . Drought also blighted 1967-68 prospects for premier
pastoralist, Elder Smith, yet its 1966-67 profit of s6m.
was excellent . . . Cigarettes kept British Tobacco going,,
parent profit was well held, but the AP and D food
interests, despite their appetite for growth, are apparently
hard put to it to break even.

THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
A buoyant year
capped with
uncertainties
BY J. C. HORSFALL
FOR THE BUSINESS WORLD it
has been an eventful year Stanley
Korman in Pentridge, Sir lan Potter
selling out to the Americans, the
devaluation of sterling, the passing of
Staniforth Ricketson and, to over-
shadow everything, the untimely death
of Mr. Harold Holt, who guided our
economic destinies for six crucial but
uneven years in our economic pro-
gress as Federal Treasurer and put
“go” into the prime-ministership. It
has also been a buoyant year for the
economy, but one in which uncer-
tainties crowded in toward its end.
A year ago, crystal-gazing (that is,
not speaking of the fates, fortunes, and
actions of business and political leaders
or of the play of external forces) was
rather easier than it is now. Then it
could be predicted with some assur-
ance that 1967 would at least see a
rise in business activity and develop-
ment from the unsatisfactory rates in
1966, when they were both depress-
ingly flat. Some people let their
imagination play on the rising economic
yeast and predicted a bumper year.
It certainly would have been had pri-
vate capital spending taken the bit.
Even in default of that happening, a
boom in the minerals world had suf-
ficiently strong outworkings in the
rest of the economy to keep things
going at a merry pace all through, a
bumper Christmas spending spree cap-
ping it off.
All that was fine. But now I’m
afraid we have to look at the com-
ing year as one in which major
adjustments must be made equally
fundamental adjustments as were
required in 1961, though rather of a
different character in some respects.
Whereas six years ago the problem
was to adjust to a recoiling boom in
fixed private investment, this time we
have a pretty clean sheet on that
score. However, one common denom-
inator is certainly the existence of
cost and price inflation pressures to
which we now must give high priority.
The distinctive feature of the adjust-
ment exercise now is that of an over-
all equating of the economy to the
new currency alignments following the
devaluation of sterling last month and
our own decision along with those
of most of our biggest exports cus-
tomers not to follow the pound. The
cost and price problems are intimately
related to this central problem of
adjustment.
I’m not saying anything new in this.
Various facets of it have been high-
lighted already by various business and
banking economists. For instance,
“drought, devaluation, and creeping in-
flation have brought much of Australia’s
rural sector to a serious position and,
of these three, creeping inflation has
probably been and will continue to be
the more costly,” says the Commercial
Bank of Australia. Then we have the
Institute of Public affairs, which, after
generalising in the Christmas edition of
its review that “by and large business
and economic prospects for 1968 seem
to be highly promising,” talks about
Government policies pushing the pace
of progress too rapidly to the detriment
of the economic structure and of infla-
tion being one of the crucial problems
in the year ahead. As the IPA sees it,
“cost and price rises which have been
proceeding at a barely tolerable annual
rate of three percent in recent years
are now accelerating to a rate which
threatens to go well beyond the toler-
able,” and forecasts a rate of “not much
less” than five percent for 1967-68 as
a whole and possibly more. The IPA
lays into the public sector’s excessive
outlays as the prime cause of inflation.
Like the CBA, the IPA is gravely
worried that inflation is going to under-
mine the viability of rural industry
(the CBA being more concerned with
the build-up of a high-core credit in-
debtedness) and the IPA goes on to
make the highly relevant point that the
minerals industry, on which so much
of our hope is built, is also vulnerable:
“The mining industries, like the rural,
could eventually be caught out in a
squeeze imposed by rising Australian
costs and the prices other countries are
prepared to pay for their products.”
At this stage it is impossible to
gauge the extent to which export and
other unsheltered industries will be
compensated for the effects on their
incomes and profit margins of having
to bear the brunt of the decision not
to devalue the dollar. The new
political climate that must emerge fol-
lowing the untimely disappearance of
Mr. Holt from the scene, could throw
up some new angles on this and even
entail some yielding to the forthright
view expressed by Mr. McEwen on
it on his return from overseas.
Obviously a stronger attempt could
now be forthcoming from rural in-
terests to press the case for maximum
compensation, while on the other side
of the fence organisations such as the
Australian Industries Development
Association are moving very actively
to get the most liberal adjustments in
the tariff to look after competition
from cheaper imports from the coun-
tries that have devalued, such as
Britain, which accounts for some 28
percent of our imports. Doubtless a
balance, not necessarily the most
economic one, will be struck in respect
both of rural incomes and competition
from imports.
One might have hoped that full
advantage of the decision not to devalue
would have been seen as a golden
opportunity to make 1968 a year in
which a start was made toward
rationalising the use of resources in
the farm sector of the economy, if
you like as a prelude to the adjust-
ments that will be necessary in the
long run in the event of Britain go-
ing into the Common Market. There
is still time to see it that way, quite
apart from the further consideration
that we would be well advised to set
about the unscrambling of Imperial
preferences something which one
would imagine is already being pressed
by some of the countries, notably Japan,
which are at the top of our export
markets and desire to increase their
share of our market for their own
importers.
One would also have hoped that
1968 would be a year in which, after
so much talk, a start would have been
made to rationalise the tariff struc-
ture and to water down the tariff so
as to induce more efficiency into Aus-
tralian manufacturing industry. With
bodies such as AIDA forcefully press-
ing for higher tariffs, that looks to be
rather a forlorn hope.


WILD CAT PAGES
You can’t follow the index
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
DON’T BELIEVE the index; in show-
ing the greatest rise ever recorded in
one year it gives a totally wrong im-
pression of what happened to Aus-
tralian share prices in 1967. Accord-
ing to the Sydney share price index,
share prices ended up the year about
one-third higher than they ended 1966,
and on two counts this is absurd.
Firstly, the index hopelessly over-
states the health of the non-mining
share market and, secondly, it under-
states the extent of the mining boom.
In fact, it has been a very poor year
indeed for non-mining shares, with
the exception of one or two indus-
trial groups. For the most part, the
stockmarket has performed just about
as dully as the economy; and that is
what to expect next year.
But how can a market be dull when
it rises 105 points from a base of 333
points? The paradox is easy enough
to explain. And it is not simply that
the mining section of the market had
an undue influence; it probably added
no more than 30 points out of the
105. The real addition to the index
came from BLIP, the king of the oil
stocks, whose price was only $6.60 this
time last year. In jumping 130 percent
in price, it has added 52-]- points to
the Sydney share price index, or
exactly half the index rise.
Add to that the impact on the index
of all the stocks that have risen because
■of their holdings of BHP shares, like
Howard Smith and so on, and BHP
is clearly the sole reason for most of
the “rise” in the market for 1967. And
then add stocks like CSR, whose only
market attraction has been its role in
iron ore and which has accounted for
about ten points of the index rise, and
something like 65 points of the 105
points rise is accounted for.
Then there are all the mining stocks

kicking the index along; CRA alone
accounted for probably 20 points, BH
South another three points. This leaves
very little for the non-mining market.
So it looks as if the non-mining part
of the stockmarket barely rose at all
during the year. Apart from a solid
increase by the banks and a recovery
in the food, drink, tobacco, and
building and construction industries, no
.• £ ~ c j , • • j
sections of the Sydney share price index
~, . 1 r
showed any real buoyancy.
So, no matter how dull the economy
may be in 1968, the non-mining part
of the share market has very little
“fat” on it that could be suddenly cut
away if expectations were disappointed.
Take a look at the Sydney share list:
Out of the first 50 stocks listed, 20
are within five cents of their lowest
point for the year and only five are
within five cents of their top. This
year, then, I’m repeating last year’s
forecast (which turned out to be pretty
good) that, apart from the mining
market, the coming year does not prom-
ise much excitement.
But in mining it is a different pic-
ture. This is a volatile market; despite
the stature of so many good stocks in
it, there are plenty of “roughies” that
could collapse. The bulk of the turn-
overs this year have been in the boom-
ing mining market, where share prices
have gone up by far more than the
one-third of the market as a whole—
and also, for that matter, far more
than the 60 percent shown by the Syd-
ney share-price mining index, which
fails to include Western Mining Cor-
poration—a stock that has more than
quadrupled its price during the year.
The average speculative investor in
this booming section of the market
probably did a lot better than the offi-
cial statistics would suggest. But it
seems most unlikely that 1968 will be
in anything like the same class.
The Melbourne market
A good haven in equities?
THE UNCERTAINTIES crowding
the industrial scene since sterling de-
valuation can t be expected to dis-
appear miraculously on the turn of the
yeai. So, few biokers are prepared to
go along with the view that the
market slide toward the end of this
i*i i r, i „ •
year, which felt the all-ordinaries
index about ten percent off the year’s
high, is exactly of the regular pour
mieux sauter variety and that before
long the index will regain or surpass
its 1967 peak, which was a clear 50
percent above the January opening
level. Of course, they could be quite
wrong, because who knows what new
oil discoveries lie just around the cor-
ner or, more precisely, just under the
ocean for BHP, whose share price
movements so distorted the true reflec-
tion of the trend in industrials pure and
simple over the past year. It is a pity
we can’t isolate BHP from the official
indexes, since it has made the boom
in industrials look more apparent than
real over the past twelve months.
_ . , . . . ,
Even so, the year has been their best
for a long time and, despite the cur-
rent uncertainties, there would not
appear to be all that much froth on
their present prices to suggest they are
going to backslide ignominiously in the
coming months. True, on the face of it,
they don’t look like getting much puff
from steam generated by the mining
market, though there, too, this year’s
remarkable happenings show that any-
thi can happen . J ust when the specu-

went their fists into the pie again to
P out one new pEim after another,
It could still be all to play for in that
direction, if only because Australia is
alive with chaps looking for new
mineral deposits.
It may be well into the new year
before the problems resulting from the
new currency alignments are satisfac-
torily resolved and all industrial suf-
ferers accommodated. In the interim,
a cautionary attitude must be expected,
markets cannot be expected to
stand still in face of the present creep-
! n § in the economy. If this
motion is more on the cost than the
demand side, and threatens to be
aggravated there by the -recent work-
vaiue-case decisions, equities have long

when the value of money is falling,
Investors can be expected to take then-
cue accordingly.

Oil search
Still very promising
AN EXCITING YEAR in the search
for oil is ending on a promising note;
last week’s news of a strong gas flow
from the Phillips Anstralian-Canadian
Superior-Snnray-Anacapa well 10 miles
off the Papuan coast (and quite near
an Oil Search area) is the fourth major
current development swinging attention
out of Bass Strait, which held the
centre of the oil stage for so long this
year. The well, with a scheduled
depth of 10,300 feet, hit gas at 6165
feet. It is being drilled in 30 feet of
water by the floating rig Glomar Con-
ception and is about 30 miles closer
to the coast than the recently aban-
doned Borabi No. 1 well.
Other offshore wells being drilled
away from the Bass Strait area are
the Ashmore Reef No. 1 well, last
reported at 6244 feet, in what many
geologists regard as one of the most
promising structures off the Australian
coast, and the Capricorn No. 1 well
off the Queensland coast, last reported
at 3100 feet.
Woodside and Mid Eastern (with
Amalgamated Petroleum having royalty
rights) are the listed partners in Ash-
more; AOG is the local partner in
Capricorn. Further interest offshore is
being generated by Wapet, which is
drilling energetically on islands off the
north-west coast of Western Aus-
tralia. The Alliance group plans an
offshore well late in 1968 in the Bona-
parte Gulf, and the Ampol-Japex part-
nership is due to drill off Proserpine,
Queensland, in 1968.
But it was not a good year for
everyone. For some it ended on a poor
note, with the highly successful BHP-
Esso partnership drawing a blank in
Crayfish A 1 off the South Australian
coast and Shell-Frome abandoning Aus-
tralia’s deepest offshore well near Port-
land, Victoria, at 13,047 feet. The
Shell oil group, out of luck compared
with its rival Esso, has spent $7.5m. on
three unsuccessful wells and is now
moving its rig to East Asian waters.
But not all the effort is offshore.
Onshore, Wapet (one seventh Ampol
Exploration) completed a busy program
of 105 wells for 1967 by spudding in
Dongara No. 6 last week, a. deline-
ation-exploratory well scheduled to a
depth of 5600 feet, and continues work
on North Murion No. 1 and Sandy
Point No. 1. Eighty-five wells are
planned for next year, and Wapet’s
budget provides sllm. for exploration.
AOG is negotiating with overseas oil
groups for a farmout deal for leases in
the Sydney basin, where Shell pulled
out after one hole in Sydney’s backyard.
The onshore search is also continuing
through the Associated group, Exoil-
Transoil, Magellan, Planet and San-
tos.
The Bulletin’s regular oil search
table will be resumed in 1968.

on every commercial.
Forget your old buying habits.
Here are the th ree new ways to buy
uncluttered prime time commer-
cials on the "GTV9 Ad-Vantage

Only GTV9 can offer you
“Ad-Vantage Plan” spot buying
because only GTV9 has limited
commercial content and con-
sistently high ratings without
valleys or peaks. Ratings prove
we’ve been top channel 10
years straight —so every prime
time buy is top value.
A recent survey by “Audience

your commercial is screened
along with 13 others, as
compared to being one of only
8, then your chance of recall
drops 53%. When you buy fixed
spots GTV9 guarantees you no

opportunity has never been
offered before and we think
you’ll agree it’s more than
worth the extra expense. Now
you can'enjoy truly selective

THE LAND What’s coming up in 1968?
No abundance and little cheer
THE RURAL INDUSTRIES do
not look like enjoying an abundant and
cheerful 1968. Drought, declining in-
comes, and problems arising from the
British devaluation began to shadow
the closing months of 1967; they will
each have a long carryover into the
new year. It is true that devaluation
has forced the Federal Government to
conduct a special inquiry into the basic
difficulties of rural industry, that the
Wheat Board will receive its $3O mil-
lion compensation for losses on sterl-
ing contracts, and that quick aid is
to be afforded the canned-fruit in-
dustry. All this does not remove much
of a fundamental uneasiness, both in-
ternal and external, afflicting many
commodities.
Droughts, of course, may suddenly
break, yet there can be no mistaking
the lingering effects of the extremely
harsh seasonal conditions which have
struck large areas of South Australia
and Tasmania, about half of Victoria,
and many parts of New South Wales
and Western Queensland. The “south-
ern” drought has followed hard upon
the barely broken “northern” one in
New South Wales and Queensland.
A direct result is that the gross
value of rural production for 1967-68
may fall as low as $3400 million,
against the previous financial year’s
$3700 million. The burden of this
decline will be taken by crops, whose
value is expected to go down by some
$346 million, or 22 percent. Livestock
products, on the other hand, could gain
a mild $23 million, or about one per-
cent. And, as every farmer knows and
complains, the drop in gross values is
taking place in an economic climate of
perpetually rising costs.
Farm costs have been increasing at
an annual rate of about six percent
over recent years. Applying this figure
to 1967-68 would produce a drop in
income left to farmers of nearly 30
percent. Of all the States, only Western
Australia is perhaps immune from this
drastic loss, for it is bound to have a
thoroughly successful wheat crop.
Turning to individual commodities,
there seems little doubt that wool must
occupy the forefront of debate
throughout a good deal of the coming
year. The Wool Board’s new marketing
scheme, which has been and will con-
tinue to be extensively scrutinised in
The Bulletin, comes up again for some
formal pronouncement by the Aus-
tralian Wool Industry Conference on
February 14. It certainly cannot be
said that the latest attempt to modify
the free-auction method of disposal has
done anything to lessen dissension
within the industry or to give any
indication that its major cost prob-
lems are brought any closer to resolu-
tion. Many grower organisations, major
buying countries, and the Australian
Council of Wool Buyers have pro-
nounced heavily against the scheme.
Whatever the AWIC decides, argument
may become as prolonged and bitter
as that which accompanied the 1965
attempt to carry a reserve-price plan.
If another referendum has to be held,
a few sources within the industry be-
lieve it may take upwards of two years’
discussions to reach that particular
goal. In the meantime, growers, who as
a whole staunchly reject direct sub-
sidies, could spend part of 1968 deter-
mining what indirect help would enable
them to wrestle more successfully with
their cost situation.
For the record, it is now obvious that
the current selling season will yield con-
siderably less than last year’s $B7O mil-
lion, although actually more wool will
be sold. Receipts for the five months
ended November are already 16.5 per-
cent below the corresponding 1966-67
period. The most recent slight firming
in prices has been more marked among
fine merino types and in the greater
production of fine wool lie the best
hopes for the industry.
AS THE AREAS OF DROUGHT
listed above make plain, wheat is the
farm product to suffer most. Prospects
for the harvest have worsened during
the past few months of 1967; indeed the
Wheat Board expects to receive a total
crop of 240 million bushels, to contrast
with last season’s 440 million bushels.
Fortunately a large carryover should
help to produce export receipts only
some five percent lower.
On July 1 next a new International
Wheat Agreement (more exactly, In-
ternational Grains Agreement) comes
into force. Its reception looks a little
doubtful, for, in the interval of non-
agreement, vigorous undercutting and
heavy internal subsidising have gone on
among the main exporting countries.
Yet the Minister for Trade, Mr. Mc-
Ewen, has always sounded exceedingly
optimistic about the efficacy of the
coming reign of the agreement, “when
the floor price, the receiving price of
wheat, would be lifted and where, .over
a period, the experience of selling
almost at a floating level, bumping on
the bottom sometimes and bumping
against the ceiling price sometimes, the
average return to wheatgrowers will no
doubt be substantially improved.” Add-
ing to such rosy anticipations of orderly
trade is the feeling of the International
Wheat Council that no heavy surpluses
are in process of building up anywhere
among the major growers.
In the immediate future, too, Aus-
tralian wheat should be more readily
sold to Asian countries. In fact, this
year, nearly 70 percent of exports will
go to Asian countries, of which 35.2
percent is accounted for by sales to
Communist China; increased sales are
being made to Japan, India, Pakistan,
Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia.
SUGAR’S CHANCES of attaining an
international agreement as (apparently)
effective as wheat at present appear
rather dim. Efforts to revive and
refurbish the old agreement resume in
April. Luckily only a small proportion
of the Australian crop is sold at the
low, although somewhat reviving, free-
market prices. The present season will
see output very close to last year’s
figure, with actual yields a little lighter.
This industry is still plagued with over-
production and the forthcoming rural
inquiry could engage itself as much
with the economics, subsidising, and
rationalising of sugar as with the more
obvious and just as critically placed
dairying industry.
The coming year (and the neat-
future) finds one of the brightest rural
possibilities in beef and veal. Large
and expansive hopes are held out for
the Queensland and (post-drought)
Victorian beef cattle industries in par-
ticular. The current season’s beef and
veal production, at around 890,000 tons,
will show some improvement on last
year’s, but remains well below 1964-65’s
record 1,010,000 tons. Australia’s cattle
population has still to recover from the
effects of the “northern” drought and
from higher slaughterings in earlier
seasons to satisfy the Americah market.
The meat industry intends, during 1968,
to make greater efforts to sell more
beef to Japan. Perhaps the disastrous
foot-and-mouth outbreak provides some
quick opportunities on the British
market; that constitutes a temporary
fillip only, for this market must be
viewed more dubiously as Britain turns
toward the Common Market.
Our rural industries are naturally
suffering from the downturn that has
characterised world commodity prices
in general. Yet, summing up, even the
drought and individual price declines
are not expected to lower export
receipts for 1967-68 by much more
than three percent. Despite,the advanc-
ing heyday of minerals and manufac-
tures, rural industry will account for
about 63 percent of Australia’s export
earnings in 1967-68.

Films , 1967
Not one of the great years
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
LOOKING BACK on 1967 we’ll prob-
ably remember best the film we didn’t
see. Forbidden movies are always the
most fascinating, so that even though
we mightn’t have thought so much of
“Ulysses,” we’ll always regret that Aus-
tralia isn’t mature enough to see it,
even in segregated audiences.
Apparently “Ulysses” got the thumbs-
down because it was too dirty; other
movies such as “Wild Angels” were
rejected for their tendency to incite
people to crime and excessive violence.
Did the censor ever stop to think that
a movie like “The Sound of Music”
might incite people to excessive virtue?
Still, we’re not utterly puritan
“Sinderella And Her Golden Bra” got
in, and something called (I think)
“Three Nuts and a Bolt,” advertised
as “the screwiest movie ever filmed.”
Even Antonioni’s “Blow-Up,” after a
lot of discussion, reached us almost in-
tact and turned out to be one of the
year’s most stimulating and memorable
films. The same director’s earlier film,
“Red Desert,” suffered slightly by being
shown in Sydney immediately after the
later one, but despite its occasional las-
situde and verbosity was interesting in
itself as well as demonstrating a stage
in the director’s development.
Probably the year’s best film was
Lumet’s “The Pawnbroker” a scari-
fying emotional experience and a bril-
liant use of cinema technique. “A Man
For All Seasons,” honored with an
Acamedy Award, was to me less satis-
factory beautifully acted and photo-
graphed and with a remarkably liter-
ate script, it had a certain emotional
coldness; its appeal was to the intellect
rather than to the heart. This lack of
feeling didn’t extend to other good
English movies “The Family Way”
and “Georgy Girl” both had human
warmth and a down-to-earth humor
refreshing after the condescending,
sentimental attitude prevalent for too
long in English films dealing with the
non-Establishment classes.
Though there was only a handful of
really top-class films I’d be hard
put to it to choose the statutory ten
the year has produced a heartening
number of extremely interesting ones
which were exciting to watch even if
they didn’t come off. There are any
number of criticisms to be levelled at
“Accident,” “The 25th Hour,” “A Fine
Madness,” and “Up the Down Stair-
case,” but they and several others were
absorbing and still memorable. And
there were some odd, off-beat movies
like “Lord Love a Duck,” “Just Like a
Woman,” “The Jokers,” and “Dead
Heat On a Merry-Go-Round,” which
came and went almost unnoticed, but
had notable originality and wit and
in the case of the first, a startling
satirical bite.
Some established directors let us
down: Hitchcock was represented by
“Torn Curtain,” a tired, washed-out
copy of his great thrillers; John
Frankenheimer was apparently so
carried away by the chance to use
Cinerama to film a favorite sport that
for “Grand Prix” he surprisingly ac-
cepted a script that was just one long
cliche. The less said of Chaplin’s “A
Countess From Hong Kong” the
kinder; Charlie has never been much
of a director, but generally had some-
thing he sincerely wanted to communi-
cate when he tries to give us roman-
tic trifles his shortcomings and com-
plete out-of-dateness are embarrassing.
Big-name European directors were
well represented. Pasolini’s bleak,
almost newsreel-styled “Gospel Ac-
cording to St. Matthew” was an excit-
ing piece of cinema, with a fresh and
a vigorous approach, undoubtedly the
most significant Biblical film to date.
Godard’s “Alphaville,” a light-hearted
piece, struck me as his most appeal-
ing film, and gave retrospective in-
terest to his segment of the three-part
“Rogopag,” which was clearly a set of
work-notes for the later movie. On the
The one that got away . . . “Ulysses”
The best we did see . . . Rod Steiger
in “The Pawnbroker”
other hand, Pasolini’s piece in the same
film, with its trumpery communist-
intellectual preaching, gave no hint of
his true quality.
Vadim gave us “The Game Is Over,”
a prettily colored and exceedingly silly
effort; Visconti’s “Sandra” was basic-
ally pretty silly, too, but stylishly made.
Truffaut’s “La Peau Douce,” a rue-
ful, clear-eyed study of adultery, was
spoilt for me by the unjustifiable melo-
drama of its ending.
Several blockbusters, of • course,
though most have been more remark-
able for size than for quality. In fact,
“Hawaii” and “Night of the Generals”
are obvious choices for the year’s worst
category; indeed, I sometimes think the
latter is the worst picture I’ve ever


seen. It was hard to judge the muddled,
poorly dubbed “Is Paris Burning?” I
believe Rene Clement has publicly dis-
avowed the version which got general
release. “The Sand Pebbles” was a
disappointing screen translation of a
fine book, though Steve McQueen’s
performance is worthy of mention.
Kawalerowicz’s “Pharaoh,” though ulti-
mately unsuccessful,' was original and
interesting, and refreshingly more con-
cerned with rational plotting than with
spectacle.
We Western enthusiasts were well
served, with a couple of rousing, old-
style movies (“El Dorado” and “The
War Wagon”) and some of the newer
“psychological” Westerns like
“Hombre” and “South West to Son-
ora.” Comedy fared less well, though
the brilliant Walter Matthau made
“The Fortune Cookie” and “A Guide
For the Married Man” seem a lot fun-
nier than they were; and Jane Fonda,
emerging as one of the screen’s most
pleasing comediennes, was charming in
a couple of very likable films, “Any
Wednesday” and “Barefoot In the
Park.” And I found the muddle and
extravagance of the multi-directed
“Casino Royale” easy to forgive for its
occasional genuine belly-laughs.
Probably 1967 won’t go down as one
of the great years, but there have been
enough rewarding films to give hearten-
ing proof that the cinema, for all its
lapses, is still one of the very liveliest
arts or crafts, at any rate.
Art
Gleeson moves on
By ELWYN LYNN
James Gleeson. Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney.
JAMES GLEESON, hitherto the only
significant proponent of surrealism in
Australia, has written its local epitaph
in an exhibition where hardly anything
disturbs by strange juxtapositions, curi-
ous isolation, or eerie atmosphere.
Mountains, swamps, plains, and seas
swirl, for the most part oleaginously,
about a well-muscled nude male, in
whose callously indifferent face few
emotions show and in whose veins no
blood flows. A few of Dali’s ants chew-
ing at this wooden body might have
won a tired surreal handclap, but the
bodies are so perfect as to be inhuman.
Indeed, it might be argued that
Gleeson wants them to resemble Don
Athaldo robots, but I think not, for
they are used to illustrate a number of
myths, one being The Birth of Aphro-
dite, where the myth seems to be that
Aphrodite was a luscious woman, for
amidst the faintly interested men she’s
a sweet, mild, pink marshmallow.
Surreal lights have been going out
all over the world: as Dali writes about
his own genius, his work reveals only
a talent for illustration and nothing
equals his work of the ’thirties; last
year died that deployer of flat, archety-
pal man-beasts, Victor Brauner, and
this year Rene Magritte. Of the mer-
curial Ernst, whose influence appears
so often even in local poetry and
sculpture we hear little. Twenty
years ago Gleeson had affinities with
Dali and continued to admire his
meticulous technique, but Gleeson was
never involved in Dali’s clear-cut
Freudian copy-book symbolism, nor was
he attracted to the single, simple images
of Magritte, who allowed the familiar
to perform the uncanny: a locomotive
entering a room through the fireplace;
a pair of boots growing its own toes;
a bowler-hatted man bearing within him
the forest he loves; and pictorial conun-
drums about reality when a painting
within a painting is just distinguishable
from the scene (in the large, actual
painting) of which it (the small inside
painting) is a depiction.
Gleeson had not been concfi -ed with
this world of hard, disparate images
and had something of the visionary
view of Redon combined with a use
of symbols, which, like Bosch’s, were
capable of interpretation: briefly,
Gleeson was not much concerned with
irrational imagery and often it was
doubtful if his paintings were surreal,
for they did not stir unconscious
motives nor did they depict them. In
fact, he was most impressive and mem-
orable in paintings like Spain and Italy
(1951, in the Art Gallery of N.S.W.),
which had something of de Chirico’s
pittura metafisica, lunar architecture,
and remote stillness. But painters like
Magritte and de Chirico were intent
upon extracting mystery from the com-
monplace, and it is probably Gleeson’s
interest in elevated subjects, like the
classical myths, that has led him into
Victorian illustration that reaches its
nadir in Death of Orion and The Gift
of Prometheus, with Prometheus in
female pose and holding two gas flames
that would ignite nothing.
Of course, not all Gleeson’s ability to
evoke the haunting and strange has
deserted him; in Crater with Revenant
a kind of Lazarus unwinds his bandages
in a desert crevasse while the El Greco
sky writhes in tatters above him; in
romantic paintings like The Wanderer
(Oedipus?) 'with a recumbent figure
isolated beneath a Courbet sky, or the
Wanderer (Peirithous 6), where the
lone horseman passes beneath a water-
fall that could be equally the fount of
death as of life, he is more interesting,
but, in his search for a new symbolism
he verges on the theatrical. In Scholar
of the Void, a luminous man stands in
a black vertical on a pterodactyl, while,
at each side, the world shifts in floating
strata, and in A Cloud of Witnesses he
combines, in well-controlled, sweeping
rhythms, references to Patinir’s rocks,
Blake’s Whirlwind of Lovers, and El
Greco’s Agony in the Garden.
The trouble is that Gleeson has be-
come his own scholar in the void: too
many of the smaller works (some of
the better ones show a kinship with
Nolan’s Shakesperian pieces) are just
too-well-thought-out, and Gleeson is
best when he still shows a shiver at
the edge of the void. He could
approach it more intuitively and less
scientifically.
Mr. Gleeson is principally an in-
tuitive, subjective painter and writer,
though of late his writing has been
less poetic, less evocative, and more
concerned with reasoned discussion
and may indicate his move toward a
more classical, cooler art of direct
communication rather than the associ-
ative art that made his contribution
so important.
It’s clear that he is going through
a crisis of approach, that he wants to
combine decoration with symbolism and
reduce the tantalising surreal ambi-
guities of his work. The show was an
odd mixture of complacency and un-
ease, but I don’t think commentators
need rush in to declare the Macquarie
Galleries a disaster area, for if Gleeson
is trying to detach the label of sur-
realist he is bound to find trouble; but
he won’t find much help in those
legions of naked wooden cliches. More
than one artist in 1967 met a crisis in
mid-career, and what will survive is
what is important.
Films
Rather a lot of
"Camelot"
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Camelot. Director, Joshua Logan.
THERE’S NO DOUBT who is the star
of “Camelot”: designer John Truscott,
whose imagination and flair make the
costumes a constant delight. They’re not
only beautiful in a medieval-fairytale
manner, they have an ease and plaus-
ibility without any of the glossy, just-
off-the-sewing-machine look that is too
often seen in costume dramas. All praise
to Mr. Truscott. Vanessa Redgrave is
pretty good, too.
The film as a whole doesn’t, unfor-
tunately, measure up to these standards.
This musical version of the Arthurian
legend is a sad diminution of T. H.
White’s “The Once And Future King,”
on which it is based; Arthur appears
as a bumbling booby rather than as an
inspired dreamer, whose ideals were
too lofty for his fellows to live up to,
and that, surely, is the point of the
story and the reason for the failure
of Round Table chivalry, not merely
the fact that his wife was unfaith-
ful. Here, however, the blame is
put squarely on the carryings-on of
Guinevere and Lancelot, which, by the
way, they don’t seem to enjoy in the
least. Since they’re good characters,


they are perpetually tortured by
conscience, though not to the extent of
behaving themselves.
Even taken on this lowered level, the
film is unsatisfactory far too long,
with stretches of dullness in which one
is even more grateful for Truscott’s
costumes and Vanessa Redgrave’s glow.
There are moments of great beauty
the montage behind the singing of “If
Ever I Would Leave You” or “The
Lusty Month Of May” but there is
a lack of stylistic unity both in Logan’s
direction and in the approach of the
players.
Vanessa Redgrave plays her role with
all sincerity as the solid, rounded
character of a woman torn between
sensuality and ingrained morality;
Richard Harris, too, aims for a realistic
approach and isn’t really to be blamed,
because the script often forces him to
behave in a dimwitted fashion. But
David Hemmings is jarringly contem-
porary, wearing Truscott’s costumes as
if they were Carnaby Street gear.
Franco Nero, a handsome and silly
Lancelot, seems to think he’s still in
the Italian Westerns in which he has
served his apprenticeship; and the three
knights, whom Guinevere chooses as her
champions, would appear to have
strayed in from a costume version of
“The Untouchables.”
The songs and lyrics, though not up
to Lerner and Loewe’s “My Fair Lady”
standards, are tuneful and charming.
Lancelot’s arrogant “G’est Moi!” has
the right swing of self-satisfaction, and
Vanessa Redgrave’s small, true, breathy
voice gives remarkable conviction to her
hymn to the pagan joys of springtime.
But Logan lets most of these sequences
run on too long almost every song
is repeated at least once and Arthur’s
final scene, when he tells a starry-eyed
boy to carry the story of Camelot back
to England, bids fair to go on for ever.
“Camelot” is an expensive, handsome
film with a lot of talent of a disorgan-
ised kind involved in it and really not
a thought in its head. Still, it’s a harm-
less, lavish entertainment for holiday
times; it is relaxing to look at, and,
after all, you don’t have to listen to the
dialogue. By the way, whatever became
of the Holy Grail?
Theatre
Hardly matters of
life and death
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Generation. William Goodhart.
Ensemble, Sydney.
The Ringbolter. Frank Hardy. New,
Sydney.
BOTH OF THESE PLAYS seem to be
written to a formula, but the prescrip-
tions are very different. “Generation”
is a smooth American comedy, amus-
ing, cleverly constructed, and a good
display-window for the actors. “The
Ringbolter,” a much more rough-and-
ready work, combines trade-union
politics, an escaped convict on the run,
and some folk-singing by Alec Hood,
all set on a coastal freighter sailing
from Newcastle to Adelaide.
“Generation” is a thoroughly middle-
brow treatment of the theme of the
conflict between the younger genera-
tion and its parents. Doris Bolton, a
charming, well-brought-up, middle-class
girl, has married Walter, who is also
charming and well behaved, in spite
of his beard, colorful clothes, and gen-
eral arty-craftiness only a few days
before the birth of their child. Doris’
father, who has made plenty of money
by “selling out,” as he and Walter both
see it, and going into advertising, comes
to visit the young couple in their pic-
turesque but spartan surroundings in
an old warehouse. He is a little taken
aback to find his newly married
Robert Bruning and Allen Bickford in William Goodhart’s play “Generation,”
Ensemble, Sydney
daughter is nine months pregnant, but
worse is to come. Walter is a do-it-
yourself boy who has made all the
furniture himself, and he and Doris
believe in expeiience. So he has
decided to carry this principle through
to the ridiculous point ,of delivering
Doris baby himself.
Heavy-handed fathers being out of
fashion, Jim Bolton has to save the
situation by strategy and guile,
smuggling in a distinguished obstetrician
in the guise of a cigar salesman. When
the situation is eventually wound up
there are some funny scenes, but soon
the familiar cries of a new-born infant
herald the reconciliation of rebellious
youth to father’s wisdom. In fact, we
have been there before in “Where’s
Daddy? ’, another Ensemble produc-
tion with a remarkably similar line of
development.
While “Generation” is about a
pseudo-conflict between parents and
child ren, “The Ringbolter” is about a
pseudo-conflict between trade unionists
on the s.s. Iron River. The issue is
protest against a new wage award. The
hotheads and romantics, led by the
wild Irishman, Paddy, want a strike,
while the more sober members of the
crew agree with Fred that a demon-
stration would be more effective. The
situation is complicated, however, by
the presence of the ringbolter, an
escaped convict. The Irishman sees him
as a fellow underdog to whom loyalty
is due, but Fred sees him as an idler
and misfit, an enemy of the working-
class. In the end solidarity is achieved
by a death, just as in “Generation” it
is achieved by a birth. Both denoue-
ments seem equally sentimental.
Both of these plays are mainly of
sociological interest for the cliches they
present. I found “The Ringbolter” the
more interesting, because it is con-
cerned with the local scene and is more
serious. But the trade-union attitudes
it presents seem like fossils under
glass, and it is alarming to think that
this kind of fierce emotion might still
attach to a purely self-interested bar-
gaining process which was once part
of a wider struggle for human rights,
a struggle which has now been largely
won.
Max Cullen has achieved a good pro-
duction of “Generation,” which is-
graced by the outstanding performance
of Cul Cullen as the unwanted
obstetrician. Obviously a born
comedian, he is continuously and de-
lightfully funny without the slightest
appearance of effort or self-display,
The actors at the New Theatre,
many of whom are presumably work-
ing men, seem curiously ill-at-ease in
portraying characters who are con-
ceived in their image. Usually, in cos-
tume for Moliere or Jonson, they are
completely unselfconscious.

Music
One voice and
one mind
By PAUL FROLICH
THE SYDNEY-BASED Leonine Con-
sort s Christmas recital, though not as
startlingly novel in program as some
of this group’s concerts, was sufficiently
varied and ambitious for any listener.
The principal excursion into adven-
turousness was the opening item: Three
Spanish Carols of the 16th century,
taken from a 1556 volume of Villan-
cicos. These carols, in which a highly
intricate polyphony vies with pious
naivety, were quite delightfully sung by
the 15 members of the Consort. This
ensemble includes such seasoned pro-
fessionals as Marilyn Richardson,
Stewart Ogilvie, and Barry Strong, and
its members proved once again in ex-
cellent voice and of one mind. Their
agile conductor, Charles Colman,
clearly has little trouble obtaining a
high degree of accuracy and finesse
whenever a piece is sufficiently re-
hearsed.
The recital was held in Sydney Uni-
versity’s Great Hall, a pleasantly cool
place on a hot night, but one that has
often proved hazardous musically. On
this occasion, somewhat in Musica
Viva’s Town Hall style, the stage was
near the centre of the main wall, the
seats arranged in a semicircle; the
resultant acoustics were, on the whole,
quite excellent. Mr. Colman teaches
music at Cranbrook College and is thus
able to call on well-trained boys’ voices,
a rare advantage. He used these un-
common resources with considerable
success in Benjamin Britten’s “A Boy
Was Born.”
Britten wrote this set of Choral Vari-
ations (opus 3) in 1933, at the age
of 20, and revised them in 1958. I had
not heard this essay of his in mediev-
alism before and found it a most
rewarding experience. The boys joined
their fresh voices to those of the
Leonine singers in a thoroughly pro-
fessional manner; if, here and there,
some final polish and accuracy seemed
to be lacking this was, I feel sure,
wholly caused by the extreme intricacy
of the music. The blending of many
varied vocal strands in this work is
truly remarkable and has rarely been
bettered by Britten in his maturity.
Variation 5, in particular, “In the
Bleak Mid-Winter,” had a tremendous
impact of heartfelt bleakness; there was
fine singing by Christopher Halliday,
the boy soloist.
After interval we turned to a com-
pletely different mood and style in
music of the 18th century. Handel’s
Concerto Grosso opus 3, No. 2, was
a sheer joy as played by the Consort’s
16 instrumentalists. Led by Ronald
Woodcock, a redoubtable fiddler at all
times, they have attained a degree of
cohesion and balance worthy of any
professional ensemble.
The concerto features two oboes and
a bassoon. I was especially taken by
the fine playing of oboist Geraldine
Room. Her playing apart, there was
the unfailingly stylish continuo sup-
plied by harpsichordist Winsome Evans.
Handel came to life as someone vastly
different from the somewhat soggy
old gent so often heard in our con-
cert halls. There was the greatly varied
sonority of the opening Vivace, the
sensuous beauty of the Largo and the
sprightly and delectable Gavotte,
nowhere was there a trace of the
Germanic austerity or portentousness
Handel is frequently suspected of.
The evening concluded with Bach’s
rarely performed Cantata No. 16, writ-
ten for New Year’s Day. This is a
work in praise of the Lord, filled with
rejoicing and crowned with a brief,
moving Chorale, in which the Con-
sort’s singers and instrumentalists
joined forces, and to good effect. The
continuo players, Winsome Evans,
cellist Nathan Waks, and violist
Margaret Berriman, played this grand
music in a truly stylish fashion.


BOOKS
The cult of the non-book
By SIMON RAVEN
A MAN RICH enough to fork out three
dollars for a round of gins, which
vanish for ever in a few moments, will
recoil with anguish and outrage when
asked to pay the same sum for a
stoutly bound volume which would
provide hours of pleasure for himself
and his entire family. There are two
reasons for this particular form of
stinginess. The first is that books, like
medicine and education, are coming to
be thought of as something to which
everyone has a “right”; they should
simply be there when wanted free.
The second is that most of us regard
writing as a spare-time amusement
which anyone, given the inclination, can
take up as easily as collecting stamps;
it is not “proper” work, and people
are therefore reluctant to pay proper
money for it.
With the first of these attitudes I
am not, in this essay, concerned. What
I wish to consider here is a line of
thought suggested by the second reason
for eschewing books by the com-
mon notion, that is, that writing is only
a hobby and that we can any of us
write a book if we want to. Lamentably
enough, this is perfectly true; anyone
who can write at all can string out
70,000 consecutive words and claim to
have composed a book. So far there
is no harm done quite the reverse:
the occupation is peaceful and often
beneficial as therapy.
The only trouble is that so many of
the resultant lucubrations find their
way not merely into publishers’ offices,
but actually into the bookshops. The
ill-written and boring memoirs of fisher-
men, shoeblacks, lieutenant-generals,
and egotistical priests, the vapid fictions
of ladies of fashion and pretty teen-
agers, the preposterous theories of
quack scientists anything and every-
thing which might just possibly have a
new “human angle” or a topical gim-
mick to sell it is thrust on the market,
thus reinforcing in the public mind
the impression that book-making is an
arrtateur business and that anyone who
is not positively certifiable is capable
of adding his quota.
A recently coined and convenient
term for such merchandise is “non-
books”; and the point to notice about
the trade in them is this: although
there is an element of hazard in their
publication, it does, on the whole, bring
in handsome profits; otherwise it would
not have been so prominent for so
long or have increased so conspicuously
in volume. At first sight, this may seem
to contradict what I said earlier —■
that the public is reluctant to buy. The
contradiction is easily resolved. When
buying non-books, people are buying
just that —non-books. These have a
ready sale because they are skilfully
presented and advertised so as to arouse
prurience or low curiosity or fantasy-
yearnings.
“Forty Years a Prostitute” and “A
King’s Story” are bound to find pur-
chasers because many people are exci-
ted by the idea of prostitutes or enjoy
day-dreaming about being kings. Only
when the glossy volume has been car-
ried home does disillusion set in. The
writing, it appears, is lifeless, the
revelations are nugatory, the only juicy
piece of gossip turns out to be the one
Simon Raven . . . naked bottoms
so temptingly quoted in the blurb; and
that, the reader tells himself, is all you
get from books. As a result of this let-
down, discredit is then imputed to all
authors whatsoever, including those,
particularly those, who make serious
professional claims, for here are people
with the impertinence to seek a con-
tinuous career and livelihood from work
which the public well knows (has it
not read “Junkie’s Delight” and “I
Married the Aly Khan”?) to be trivial,
shoddy, and inept.
Each time a buyer, having forgotten
his previous disappointment and, being
titillated by a piquant photograph of a
naked bottom on the cover, succumbs
to the lure of another non-book, his
contempt for the world of letters in-
creases and the likelihood that he will
ever buy a genuine volume of litera-
ture (which does not even have a
naked bottom to recommend it)
dwindles yet further. He may still be
prepared to risk some money in the
hope of being shocked or titillated, but
for the rest . . . no.
Now, the obvious answer for the
publisher is to put naked bottoms
(however irrelevant) on the covers of
his serious books, in the hope that these
will be mistaken for non-books and
achieve substantial sales accordingly.
This, of course, is common practice in
the paperback trade; but hardback
publishers, by and large, are fastidious
men who are proud of their “quality”
wares and disdain to vulgarise them.
Although they are certainly not above
making money out of the non-book
racket (which is by now essential to
their survival), they have a real sense
of literature, and when they are put-
ting out a literary work they present it
with the dignity they know it deserves.
They have an almost masochistic relish,
one sometimes feels, for the lower sales
which must probably result from such
sedate procedure: but after all, pub-
lishing is still a “gentleman’s profession”
rather than a trade; and in any case
there is always the chance of a good
deal with the paperback people, whose
endearing and perennial vanity it is to
procure “prestige names” for their lists
and (bless their hearts) to pay gener-
ously for the privilege.
None of that, however, affects the
basic issue, this being that the market
is swamped with gimmicky and cleverly
got-up non-books, which are taken by
their readers for literature and lead to
its instant disrepute. When this issue
is raised, most people, even intelligent
people, shrug hopelessly, mumble some-
thing about the price of democracy and
popular education, and leave it at
that: it is all, they imply, beyond
remedy. This may be so; but there is
one thing at least which we can do
about it we can ensure matters get
no worse.
We can point out, to those few who
are willing to listen, that there is a
difference between literature and non-
literature (however expensively pack-
aged) and wherein this difference con-
sists. We can maintain a critical know-
ledge of proper standards, even if the
public at large refuses to respect them.
Those whose duty it is to maintain
such knowledge are, of course, school-
masters, dons, and literary critics of the
order which writes reviews for respon-
sible journals: for schoolmasters and
dons as such I am now too old to ans-

THIS IS RIGHT
wer; but of critics and reviewers I do
know something, and I have no hesi-
tation in saying that they are failing
us dismally.
For the crucial point is this: non-
books are currently being accorded,
even in journals of merit and distinc-
tion, the critical accolade which was
formerly reserved for serious work.
They are being given space, that is to
say, and they are being given praise—
by those who should know better. Stan-
dards have been lowered in order that
non-books may be treated with respect.
To be more precise, let me now in-
stance just two significant ways in
which reviewers (consciously or not)
are stinting their duty in order to
accommodate non-books.
In the first place, little or no atten-
tion is paid, in assessing contemporary
books, to their grammar, syntax, and
style. It is thought to be pedantic, these
days, to complain about the first two
and somehow “undemocratic” to insist
on the last. Style, we are given to un-
derstand, is in any case an artifice;
what we should be looking for is sin-
cerity, compassion (etc., etc.).
There is also little attempt to
assess rhythm and construction. As any
conscientious writer knows, one of the
most difficult and worthwhile things
to achieve in a book is the balanced
exposition of the thesis (or, in a novel,
the plot), without longueurs, and over-
emphases on the one hand or evasions
and omissions on the other. But critics,
while they seldom acknowledge sound
construction when it is before them, are
quick to praise convenient evasions.
It is one thing that public taste
should have been corrupted to the point
where literature is no longer distin-
guished from the confessions of crooked
footballers or the glutinous pieties of
politicians on the make; it is quite
another thing that the body of critical
authority should condone and even
approve of this situation.
Power game
By NANCY KEESING
Dynasty. Tony Morphett. Jacaranda.
$4.95.
“DYNASTY” IS one of the most com-
pulsively readable novels of 1967. The
stark, clenched fist on the well-designed
cover sets the mood for the book. At
its simplest level of theme and plot, the
story tells of a family newspaper
empire, and of the struggle of each of
the three sons of the aging, but still
competent proprietor, to wrest control
from his father.
Already people are guessing: which
newspaper? Which family? It seems to
me the answer is all and none. The
actual family business, its history,
ramifications, influence could, with
alterations, be quite easily applied to
any other concern provided the indus-
try itself is of a sort to capture imagi-
nation a biscuit factory would
hardly do, a shipping company would.
It is natural that Australian readers
will play guessing games because so
many of them know about Morphett’s
last, ill-starred novel which was pulped
on publication day when its central
character appeared, rather nebulously
and accidentally, to resemble an actual
person. Such disasters wreck some
careers and act as spurs to others. It
would seem to have spurred Morphett,
who, I presume as a result of it, has
contrived a most effective method of
anonymity. Of the large cast of charac-
ters in “Dynasty” only two are named.
Anyone who has attempted to recount
some scandalous tale without divulging
names will appreciate that this must
have posed considerable problems, but
the narrative flows without any effect
of strain or obscurity.
Anonymity cloaks not only charac-
ters but the city in which “The Day”
is published. If Morphett were to con-
tinue using this device in subsequent
novels, the effect might become “gim-
micky,” but here it is nothing of the
sort and I can recall only one brief
instance when any confusion resulted.
The book opens as the father, now
68, is about to join his board
for a meeting at which, however
politely, he may be deprived of effec-
tive control of “The Day.” The board
numbers seven the father; three
sons; the editor; Londonson, the busi-
ness-manager and lawyer with a
financial stake in “The Day”; and
Goldberg, an Austrian Jew, refugee
from Hitler’s Germany, who has large
investments in the company. To each
of these men “The Day” represents
far more than a job, an investment, a
business concern.
To the father and his eldest son,
journalists of outstanding ability, voca-
tion, and conviction, “The Day” is a
voice which each wishes to possess. To
its brilliant editor, himself an aging
man, it is a life-long instrument of
power and revenge. His will to revenge
is too insatiable for one lifetime to
suffice. The second son is a flawed
man devious and, by some people,
underrated. The youngest craves
different voices he is a radio and
television man and eventually (the
1970 s perhaps?) may precipitate a
civil war. Londonson and Goldberg
are outsiders who are insiders the
indispensable rim that binds the wheel.
The book is constructed in seven
parts, one to each board member, with
an interlude for the board meeting
between each section. Each part is
biographical for its character while
advancing the action of the few hours
of the meeting. These biographies are
impressive for their historical sweep
both in large outlines and small, even
domestic, details. Morphett, born in
1938, has a formidable talent for
imaginative historical reconstruction.
The title is the book: an exploration
of dynasty. Too many present-day
readers sum up books as being about
the corrupting nature of power when
they are really no such thing. If the
ability to cope with highly complicated
situations is corrupt, then by definition
all able men are corrupt because no
highly complicated situation contains
absolute right or wrong.
If a label must be pinned it would
be better to say that ‘‘Dynasty” is
about life and essentially shows how,
for any intelligent, energetic, and
ambitious man, one life can never be
enough. About how children are
visited with the virtues, together with
sins and suffered wrongs of their
fathers, but no father can dictate which
virtues, which sins shall emerge and
influence. About love, and what can
happen to love over a lifetime. About
secrets, and how secrets are impos-
sible the guiltier the secret, the
greater the impossibility.
Most of all, though, “Dynasty”
demonstrates that, while no man is an
island, every man is very much alone
with his mixtures of love and hate,
goodness and badness. To Goldberg
belongs the summing up: “Do big
things happen without struggles? I
don’t think so. Where there’s no
struggle there’s no virtue. And where
there’s no virtue there’s no evil.”
THE AUTUMN FOOL
His smile like a withered leaf
Hangs in the bare
Twigs of his hands.
Forests of smiles
Fall through his open fingers,
Never to be caught again.
The trees in a quiet street
Have turbulent windows that
Reflect the sunset’s shambles.
Like a crack in a pane,
The new moon, his own curved
profile,
Does not turn its face to his.
A last leaf blows
Lightly away, a forgotten smile,
Dying where the pavement ends.

If you’ve only the
vaguest notion of
vvnat Clarified Butter is,
Graham Kerrwoukl like
a hundred or so words
with you.
“Clarified Butter is quite simply puredairy
butter with the water, salt and curd re-
moved. In fact, it's over 99% pure butter-
fat. As it contains no moisture it doesn't
splutter and foam' when it’s melted. And
because the salt and curd have been
removed, it won't catch or burn. You can
shallow fry and saute with it and come up
with a perfect job every time. What's more
you use Clarified Butter at temperatures
lower than those recommended for other
cooking fats and oils. This means protein
fibres are cooked more gently. They don't
toughen up. And you have to use so little
Clarified Butter in your cooking. Just
enough to coverthe bottom of the pan very
lightly. Foods don’t come to the table
groaning with the fat they've absorbed.
But they do come with all the flavour,
nutrition and downright appetite appeal
that only pure dairy butter can give them.
Look, to show you what I mean, get the
little woman to buy some Clarified Butter
(it's also sold as Ghee or Butter-Oil, by the
way) and nip into the kitchen and try your
hand at this recipe. I'm willing to bet you’ll
be won over to Clarified Butter for life."

Aquadventurers
By JOHN BAXTER
Go To The Widow Maker. James
Jones. Collins. $3.85.
BECAUSE WRITERS TEND to judge
other writers by such technical con-
siderations as the ability to plot,
develop, and control the pace of a
story, James Jones is considered by
many American authors of popular
fiction to be a phenomenon of our
time. No stylist and deficient in
original ideas, he sustains his long
novels with a combination of intelligent
characterisation and the informed des-
cription of interesting activities. “Go
To The Widow Maker,” like his
earlier successes “From Here To
Eternity” and “The Thin Red Line,”
gives us a handful of individuals,
places them against a background suf-
ficiently unusual to engage our atten-
tion, then lets them work out their
varied reactions to a common stimulus,
usually the threat of violent death. The
result is not especially revealing of
character, but like the best of American
popular fiction is invariably easy to
read.
Jones’ chosen background in “Go To
The Widow Maker” is scuba-diving
and the society of professionals and
dedicated amateurs which has grown
up around the sport. As in previous
novels, his central character is sensi-
tive, talented, at odds with his environ-
ment, but nevertheless courageously
coming to terms with it. There is a
certain obvious narcissism in Jones’
casting as his hero America’s greatest
playwright, but we are soon diverted
from this piece of self-congratulation
by the knowledge and enthusiasm which
inform the book. His picture of skin-
diving around the West Indies is
accurate, calculated, and wholly con-
vincing, providing the book’s main
centre of interest.
There is clearly a thread of auto-
biography running through Jones’ des-
cription of playwright Ron Grant. Like
Jones, Grant is a famous writer who
has reached a plateau in his career
and is doubtful of his ability or wil-
lingness to continue in his present situa-
tion. Grant takes up skin-diving, as did
Jones, in order to experience a new
stimulus as different as possible from
his sedentary occupation, and finds in
it the combination of danger and male
companionship, which neutralises the
poisons of intellectualism which have
been vitiating him. Here, in a sense,
is the last dangerous frontier, an area
where men not especially devoted to
any great or challenging activity can
face death and thus confirm themselves
in life.
This preoccupation with danger as
a yardstick for life is referred to fre-
quently by Jones, and emerges as an
underlying motif, on top of which he
lays a complex set of situations in
which Grant struggles to cast off a long-
standing and perverse love affair with
an older woman and to establish some
sort of entente with his new wife, a
wildly sexy and individualistic creature
to whose lurid past, raging temper, and
highly charged eroticism he finds it dif-
ficult to adjust. Standing in the path
of this understanding are his own
doubts as to his ability both as a writer
and a human being; his regard, compli- j
cated by envy and an implied homo-
sexual attraction, for Bonham, the man '
who teaches him to dive, and a series
of sexual attachments which make the j
assumption of a life of monogamy
extremely difficult.
To Jones sex is a factor in the re-
fining of character at least as im-
portant as the risking of life and the
true companionship of other men. Few
recent books have been as consistently
concerned with sexuality or as out-
spoken in its depiction as “Go To The
Widow Maker.” The sexual histories
of Grant, his wife Lucky, Bonham, and
a variety of subsidiary characters are
examined in detail, and no opportunity
is lost to describe in meticulous if un-
romantic detail the liaisons each of
them forms. Four-letter words abound,
spoken with equal insouciance by
women and men alike, giving the dia-
logue a locker-room virility not always
in keeping with the theme. After the
first 100 pages, one becomes largely ;
uninterested in the “Playboy” mas-
culinity of the story and concentrates
on Grant’s underwater adventures.
Whatever faults the interplay of
character may have, it is difficult to
criticise Jones’ description of under-
water life. His detailed evocation of
shark-hunting and fishing for groper
in the clear waters of the Caribbean
has the economy of America’s best
fiction, uncluttered by an excess of
literary style. This is popular writing
of the first order, tense, sharp, emin-
ently clear, justifying totally Jones’
large reputation as a technician. If
one can endure the longueurs of the
early chapters, the balance, with their
meticulously described and dramatised
scenes of submarine adventure, must
come to any admirer of American fic-
tion as an agreeable surprise.

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
When the kids
should neither
be seen nor heard
HAVING, IN MY last column, con-
demned the practice of having business
dinners at home, the time seems right
to comment on the “at home” dinner
for the family.
First on the long list of problems is
whether or not to include the whole
family. I suspect that this issue is
highly controversial. It depends so
much upon the individual’s attitude.
But personally I can see no reason why
from Monday to Friday we should
eat with our children; in fact, I con-
sider family eating is a disaster. At the
weekend I’m fully in favor, and enjoy
the children’s company.
My thinking is largely colored by
their age group. I have an 11-year-old
girl and my son is nearly eight. From
the time that they were capable of
sitting up to a table and eating with-
out supervision—in our case from five
years old —they have had a separately
cooked evening meal on their own.
I intend that it shall stay this way
until my daughter is 15. This decision
may appear incredibly selfish, but from
experience it helps to make life a lot
easier, more enjoyable, and eating be-
comes a daily pleasure instead of a
refuelling routine.
By far the most important reason is
one of time. I don’t favor children
eating a large meal when they are
tired or when their bedtime is within
two hours of mealtime. In both cases
there is a serious risk of upsetting their
sensitive digestive processes perhaps
for the rest of their lives.
This obviously points to a 5 p.m,-
fi p.m. timeslot for their meal. If it is
to be a family affair it means that the
man of the house has only minutes
between his return home from the
office and the evening meal. This is a
■disaster.
No man should be expected to eat
within one hour of his return home—
no matter what his occupation. Most
executives work in the city areas and
in addition to their eight hours plus
at the desk, they have at least half
an hour travelling added at the end
of the day. It is impossible to expect
the digestive system to cope with this
tension and perform efficiently. A
period of total relaxation is therefore
essential. The earliest time to eat is
then 7 p.m. and the most preferable
average time 8 p.m. To suggest that
children under 15 should eat at 8 p.m.
is irresponsible.
A most understandable argument is
used against my views; that of the
mother who says “but I have to cook
two meals.” I agree and would hope
that this would be the case re-
heated food for Father is just as bad as
a 6 p.m. “supper.” There is no
satisfactory escape from the two-meal
approach because it is an ideal one.
There are few children who enjoy a
fine hot curry, and many other dishes
that are appreciated by a developed,
adult taste are unacceptable to children.
In turn, if an adult has to have the
more bland, unvaried junior menu, this
obviously limits his enjoyment and
freedom to experiment, which is really
the only way to approach good food.
Lastly comes the question of the
wife. When a groom waits for his
bride at the altar, they are two people
in love, looking forward to spending
their whole life together. But look at
the facts. Awake at 7 a.m., dress and
breakfast, and husband off to work by
8.30 a.m. Total “togetherness” time
about 30 minutes. Husband away all
day. At home, awake from about 6
o’clock until 10.30 p.m. Out of 13-|
hours, there is a maximum of five
hours “togetherness,” or 25 hours over
the working week.
If dinner is served early and the
evening spent in front of the TV, the
maximum can possibly get down to
somewhere about an hour a day.
At the very least the evening meal
should be isolated from the radio,
newspapers, and books, TV, telephone,
and children. One solid hour without
interruption every woman is, in my
opinion, fully entitled to have this writ-
ten into her marriage contract.
Where then, should one eat? Recently
I had an interesting discussion with
Paul Talbot and his lovely wife, Susan.
Paul is president of Fremantle Inter-
natipnal and they live in a skyscraper
apartment in New York. Their dining-
room has no overhead or wall-bracket
electric lighting. In New York there
are dining-rooms designed for single
candle-power only.
What a wonderful idea. This is the
sort of atmosphere for every-night eat-
ing. Why keep the candles for enter-
taining only? Don’t you like to see your
wife’s face by candlelight?
To my mind there is absolutely no
argument. A successful man, both in
his business and as a father and hus-
band, can only remain so if he eats
well, at the right time, and in the
right environment.
So, there are the basic rules: don’t
serve dinner within less than an hour
of return home, and preferably 8 p.m.
or later, dine with wife only, eat in
the dining-room at an attractively laid
table lit by candles only, no inter-
ruptions, experiment with the menus
and allow at least an hour for the
meal.
LETTERS
Running Australia by the
seat of our pants
Peter Samuel’s alarming account of
the current state of Australian
economics is welcome, for it confronts
the public explicitly with the price that
it pays for inadequate and sloppy
advice to governments. If it were to
lead to a national inquiry into the
training and employment of economists
in Australia (and especially into the
low priority accorded to economics in
our educational system), it would be a
signal service to the community.
There are, however, two aspects of
Samuel’s analysis which, in my judg-
ment, call for critical comment. One
is his reference to “the extraordinarily
gross cannibalistic appetite of the econ-
omics departments of the universities”
and his call for “closer restraints on the
expansion of university economics de-
partments.” The other is his criticism
of university economists for their
failure to comment sufficiently “on the
state of the economy and the quality
of the Government’s management.”
As the head of the economics dis-
cipline in a new university, which has
yet to produce its own graduates, I am
as aware and disturbed as Samuel at
the proprietary attitude of the heads of
older departments to their honors grad-
uates. I concede also that the univer-
sities have absorbed some graduates in
marginal research projects who might
be employed with greater advantage
to themselves and the community in
the public service. But these short-
comings should not be allowed to ob-
scure the basic truth of the position:
that both the public service and the
universities (along with other em-
ployers) are suffering from an overall
scarcity of well-trained economists.
Most of the universities have unfilled
vacancies in economics, and in some
cases the problem is very serious. In
these universities, the teaching loads
of the economics staff is high and, in
a variety of ways, the students suffer.
It is a difficult question whether the
needs of the public service or the uni-
versities are the more urgent; but it is
plain that any diversion of economists
from the universities will exacerbate
the long-term scarcity of properly
trained graduates. In my view, our
present difficulties are due in part to
a long-standing failure of both our
secondary and our tertiary education
systems to provide adequate encourage-
ment for the study of the social sciences
in general, and of economics in parti-
cular. It would be unfortunate if any
action were how taken which further

weakened this part of our educational
effort.
Turning to the second theme, I
acknowledge that detailed discussion
of short-term economic policy has not,
in recent years, been a preoccupation
of more than a minority of academic
economists. I am not sure of the
reasons for this, but they undoubtedly
include the difficulty of combining
heavy teaching loads with the consider-
able task of keeping up to date with the
mass of current economic data now
available. In any event, this deficiency
will to some extent be remedied in
future by “The Australian Economic
Review,” to be produced quarterly by
Melbourne University’s Institute of
Applied Economic Research. Of
course, Samuel would agree that
economics departments in the univer-
sities must have extensive interests in
aspects of the subjects other than
current policy problems.
At one point it is difficult to tell
whether Samuel believes that the
academics write too little or too much
(the latter seems to be implied by his
reference to the greatly increased
number of journal articles published
now by comparison with the ’fifties).
However, the former is more con-
sistent with his complaint that news-
paper economists and financial writers
have contributed more to the public
debate >f economic issues in recent
years than all of the university
economists. Samuel also applauds
S. J. Butlin’s comparison of recent
economic research with the dedication
of pre-war economists to the “big”
issues of their time.
The truth is that, with the advance
of the discipline, economists are increas-
ingly aware of the necessity for the
analysis of “big” issues to have a
thorough foundation in theory and
empirical research. Much of this spade-
work is unspectacular and perhaps tire-
some to the economic journalists. But
the journalist, in attempting to avoid
it, may be occupying ground where
angels fear to tread. It is sobering to
recall some of the contributions of the
pre-war economists to the big issues of
their time: the “balanced budget”
advice of 1930-31, policy prescriptions
based on confident forecasts of a de-
clining population, and Reddaway’s
proposal for a wage increase in 1937
to combat an inflationary boom —at a
time when unemployment exceeded
eight percent.
Moreover, a more diffident approach
to the big issues is due in part to a
growing awareness of the element of
presumption, and even of quackery, in
economists’ claiming to have the answers
to questions of policy. They can claim
expertise when they discuss the effects
of devaluation, wage increases, mar-
garine quotas, or the Ord River
scheme. Whether or not these effects
justify the policies in question is a
quite different matter. The relative
claims to benevolent treatment by gov-
ernments of wool-growers, industrial
wage earners, dairy farmers, and Ord
River settlers are a political and not
an economic issue.
Finally, I feel that Samuel might
have been more generous in his recog-
nition of what the academic economists
have contributed to the discussion of
important issues. A comprehensive list
would occupy too much space, but
among the contributions overlooked by
Samuel were Artis and Wallace’s ex-
amination of fiscal policy, Karmel’s
work on the economics of education,
the study of tax reform by Downing
and others, the Melbourne survey of
poverty, Maureen Brunt’s work on re-
strictive practices, and my own on un-
employment. By no means do I claim
that all is well in Australian economics,
but exaggeration does not strengthen
Samuel’s case.

Which way for the DLP?
Mr. Alan Reid, in “Which Way Now
For The DLP?” (8., Dec. 16), makes
the following statement in relation to
myself: “An article in his mouthpiece
(sic) the “News-Weekly” goes very
close to expressing his sorrow that the
DLP made the electoral advances that
it did in the Senate election.”
May I make four points clear:
1. Ever since the foundation of the
DLP, in the aftermath of the Labor
“split,” I have given most of my time
and energy to helping the DLP to in-
crease its vote.
2. Of all the elections which have
taken place since that date, the results
of the 1967 Senate elections were the
most gratifying to me personally. It is
not too much to say that my sense of
satisfaction was completely unalloyed.
3. As to the significance of the in-
crease in the DLP vote. “News-
Weekly” pointed out that the best
starting-point for purposes of compari-
son was not the 1966 Federal elections
but the 1964 Senate elections. It added
that it might be better for gratified
DLP supporters like myself not
to assume too much until a general
election had confirmed the figures
obtained on November 25. Right or
wrong, caution in assessing election
results is a most desirable quality
which might be copied by political
correspondents.
4. Mr. Reid’s remark that “News-
Weekly’s” approach will bring me into
conflict “with those within the DLP
such as its present parliamentary
leader, Vince Gair,” etc., is quite
gratuitous and has no foundation in
fact.
