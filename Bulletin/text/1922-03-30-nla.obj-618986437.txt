[BATTERY CHARGED
is Simple, Reliable and Efficient.
READ WHAT USERS THINK.
M. F. Rowe, Motor Engineer, Redmyre Road,
Strathfield:
“The large Tungar has been in service 9 months and has given
most satisfactory results. 1 am absolutely convinced that , the
Tungar is c by far the simplest and most reliable method of Battery-
charging when Alternating Current Supply is available.”
Powell Motors, 499 Parramatta Road, Leichhardt:
“Now that we know the advantages of charging with a Tungar
we would not consider for one moment a Motor Generator or
other mechanical device at half the price.”
Davies & Davies, 114 Hunter Street, Sydney:
“In reply to your inquiry as to how the Battery Charger which
we installed some little time ago is behaving we take pleasure
in advising that it is doing all that you claimed it would, and is
giving the utmost satisfaction.”
Neal & Dickason, 532 Kiewa Street, Albury:
We recommend with the utmost confidence the Tungar Rectifier
to all Motor Garages, Battery Service Stations, etc., requiring the
most efficient method of charging Storage Batteries with the
minimum amount of trouble and attention, situated in any town
where there is an Alternating Current Supply available.”

These Smiling Shavers l
Now honestly, when you shave, do
you have a silly grin on your face—
like a boy who is told for the first time
by a pretty girl that he has lovely eyes?
I have had a lot of trouble that way
with artists. Their only conception
of registering satisfaction seems to
be an idiotic smirk. So I have given
up this obvious way of illustrating a
shaving cream advertisement.
At best, shaving is a serious per-
formance. It demands mental concen-
tration rather than blithesome vacuity.
What Mennen Shaving Cream does
is to get rid of the pain and pulling and
meanness. It takes all the fight out of
your beard and enablesyou to remove
it instead of hacking it off.
Becauseit doesn'thave to be rubbed
in with fingers and contains no free
caustic, it never irritates your skin, and
your face feels wonderful afterwards.
Everyone who has tried Mennen’s
thinks it’s great. I know you will, too.

The Red Page
Knut Hamsun
The judgments of the Swedish Academy in
bestowing the Nobel Prize have been open
to question, but they have never been absurd.
It would be easy to accuse that body of
myopia, of a tendency to keep its eyes fixed
on Scandinavia to the exclusion of the rest
of the world, but all its errors have been
those of omission. * It has failed to crown the
Englishman Thomas Hardy, the Pole Joseph
Conrad, the Dutchman Louis Couperus, and
it has overlooked the literary achievements
of modern Prance, but at least it has never
made the gross blunder of crowning a
chanatan.
limit Hamsun is one of its questionable
choices, for his reputation rests mainly on
one book, “Growth of the Soil”—a great
book, an epic in it's, way, but not one that
convinces you that its author has many such
in him. He struck a vein of rich subject-
matter, and explored it with energy and gusto,
burrowing deep into the ground. A lucky
find after years of prospecting. The question
is whether he has the art to make lull use
of the ore he has laid bare.
Hamsun is now a man verging on sixty,
and he has been long in finding his literary
feet. Asa youth lie tried the literary life
in Christiania, but achieving no success emi-
grated to America. There he drifted from
one job to another, fishing on the coast,
collecting fares and experiences on the Chi-
cago street-cars, and spending his spare time
in learning English. Finally he went back
to Norway and tried the literary life again.
This time he' was more successful, but the
title of one of his first books, "Hunger,”
shows that his career was no primrose-path.
The book is subjective, a piece of veiled
autobiography, and being rather hysterical
has little artistic value.
Strangely enough, what Hamsun seemed to
jack was material, or perhaps the capacity
to treat such material as he had stored. His
first books show him as fiercely Philistine.
He had a passion to demonstrate the solid
worth of commercial life as opposed to the
flimsiness of Bohemia—a peculiar type of
idealism that he may have become infected
with in America. Or was it that his failure
to win recognition had filled him with a
personal grievance against the artistic world?
At any rate his idealisation of the stolid ware-
housemen of Bergen dreaming romantically
of Cathay as they ordered their chests of
tea j was not convincing. There is nothing
to object to in enthusiasm for such types;
Gustav Frenssen has made his Hamburg
warehousemen real and delightful; but when
their comfortable lives are deliberately op-
posed to that of the artist it looks as if a
propagandist case is being made out. And
the early Hamsun had the thin passion of
the propagandist. His artists are morbid,
egoistic creatures, staggering home at dawn
after futile, all-night conversations—a fit
object of contempt to the gorgeous men of
commerce going to their romantic ware-
houses by the quayside.
This may have brought him some popular-
ity, but it was special pleading rather than
art, and not fundamentally sincere. Artis-
tic sincerity can never be achieved on a
plane of polemics. Hamsun’s passion to
idealise something solid and material found
better scope when he turned to the soil. His
chief character in “Growth of the Soil” is
the brown, hungry earth itselfi—not the
fat, agricultural lands, but the unbroken
wilderness. There is a hero, of course, a
man who goes out to pioneer the waste
country on the edge of Lapland, but his
qualities are almost as primitive as the soil
he ploughs. He is a bearer of burdens, a
lifter of heavy stones, a being hardly articu-
late. Then there is the hare-lipped woman
who goes to live with him. Hamsun -proves
his genius by giving an epic grandeur to the
struggle of this pair in wresting a living
from the soil and carving out a home for
their brood. He evokes a magic from rocks,
stunted trees, fields newly-ploughed. And
the characters, hardly more distinct than
animals at the beginning, gradually become
individualised as the story develops. An
inner life unfolds in them : they prove inter-
esting, even lovable human beings. In the
end come prosperity, the growth of a large
family, the beginnings of a civilisation
around the desolate spot that the hero
pioneered.
But it is a harsh civilisation, built on the
peasant virtues and vices. There is no trace
here of the ideal rural civilisation dreamt of
by A.E. and the Irish co-operators. What-
ever gives grace to a people—dancing, sing-
ing, music—Hamsun bans as an irrelevance,
liable to interfere with the sober business
of life. All his failures are people whose
instincts are sociable, who are fonder of
talking to their neighbors than of counting
the sheep in their paddocks and the cheeses
in their larders. Some of the characters
(the wandering Oline, for instance) speak
with the wild eloquence of Synge’s people,
but if imagination enters their lives it is to
their hurt. For the old man, the pioneer,
there is more real pleasure in rooting a
large stone out of the ground than in
all the arts of civilisation. Nothing can
give permanent 'happiness, says Hamsun,
except what comes out of the soil, and the
people who have wandered too far from the
Earth-Mother become dim, shadowy, trivial.
All very well, but the sentimentality he
eschews in treating the emotions of his
characters he is liable to concentrate in this
main idea of the healing virtue of the soil.
Of ordinary sentimentality there is not a
flicker in the book. The incidents of love,
birth, death are treated summarily, without
the waste of a sentence; but why all this
lyricism about Nature, if she is such a nig-
gardly mother, offering so little joy or
variety? Is this crude, stump-grubbing ex-
istence "the best form of life that has been
evolved? .
It is Hamsun’s failure as an artist that
he continually prompts notes of interroga-
tion He makes out his case with the fanat-
icism of a proselyte rather than with the
assurance of an old believer. But his
achievement is great, and in an urbanised
Ettrope he has penetrated the soil beneath
the paving stones.
VANCE PALMER.
Sense and Nonsense
A recent Red Page contributor divided
writers into two classes —those who have
and those who have not a sense of humor.
The highest form of literary genius is fre-
quently devoid of the saving salt—witness
Goethe, Shelley and Schiller, who had little
or none —while some of the loftiest intel-
lects —Shakspeare, Cervantes, Holmes —were
endowed richly. Rarer far, however, than
the sense of humor is the faculty for writ-
ing fine nonsense. Many people confound
the two, but they are really far apart. The
foundation of humor, when all is said and
done, is sound sense. When fancy or emo-
tion carries us off to exalted heights it is
humor brings us hack to Mother Earth. But
nonsense of the superfine variety, has its
roots in the imagination. De Quincey once
said: “None but a man of extraordinary
talent can write first-class nonsense.” He
might have added that none but a man of
taste can appreciate it when written.
Such men as Tennyson and John Ruskin
held Edward Lear, “the parent of modern
nonsense-writers,” in the highest esteem.
The school of avowed monsense-vorSe writ-
ers is of comparatively recent origin, though
here and there we come across an speci-
men going back two or three hundred years.
Bishon Corbet in the early part of the 17th
century supplied us with an excellent
example:—
Like to the thundering: tone of unspoke speeches,
Or like a lobster clad in logic breeches,
Or like the grey fur of a crimson cat,
Or like the mooncalf in a slipshod hat,
E’en such was he who spake, and yet no doubt
Spake to small purpose when his tongue was out.
Between Bishop Corbet’s sportive effusion
and the 19th-century writer in Punch who
produced the following stanza the kinship is
quite unmistakable:—
’Tis midnight and the-setting sun
Is slowly rising in the west;
The rapid rivers slowly run,
The frog is on his downy nest;
The pensive goat and sportive cow
Hilarious leap from bough to bough.
Though few of his readers are aware of
it. the great Algernon Swinburne —also an
admirer of 'Edward Lear, by the way—occa-
sionally struck the “lighter lyre” not un-
tunefully. Criticising the weakness of his
own style, he remarked that its great blem-
ish was that it tended to “degenerate into
melodious nonsense.” He furnished a not-
able sample:—
LOVE.
From the depths of the dreamy decline of the dawn
through a notable nimbus of nebulous noon-
shine,
Pallid and pink as the palm of the flag-flower that
flickers with fear of the flies as they float,
Are the looks of our lovers that lustrously lean from
a marvel of m.vstie, miraculous moonshine,
These that we feel in the blood of our blushes that
i thicken and threaten with sobs from the .throat.
Nonsense verses run to all shapes and
sizes. Between Swinburne’s and “Aunt
Jobiska” there is little or no resemblance.
The one Is pure melodious blither with a
note of idiotic artistry running through it;
the other is suffused by an irresistible note
of drollery:—
In the nice hew well
That the plumber built her
Aunt Jobiska fell.
AVe must get a filter.
Lewis Carroll’s “Alice in Wonderland,”
with its weird and wonderful Jabberwock,
is too well known to need quotation; but
Edward Lear’s Pobble deserves to be better
acquainted:—
The Pobble who has no toes
Swam across the Bristol Channel,
But before he set out he wrapped his nose
In a piece of scarlet flannel.
For his Aunt Jobiska said: “No harm
Can come to his toes if his nose is warm ;
And it’s perfectly known that a Pobble’s toes
Are safe —provided he minds his hose.”
The Pobble swam fast and well,
And when boats or ships came near him
He tinkledly-binkledly winkled a bell.
So that all t.he world could hear him.
And all the sailors and admirals cried
When they saw him nearing the farther side:
“He has gone to fish for his Aunt Jobiska’s
Runcible cat with crimson whiskers!”
As an explanation of how literary men
perform their miracles, it would be hard to
beat the Yankee bard who parodied Gelett
Burgess in this quaint fashion :
I write my verses in the dark •
And do not have to think;
I make my fingers chase the pen
And the pen chase the ink.
Yet a nonsense verse may be fraught with
a tender pathos or tinted with a divine
melancholy. Witness: —
Oh, to be wafted away
From this black Aceldama of sorrow,
Where the dust of an earthy to-day
Makes the earth of a dusty to-morrow.
Neither is all the good nonsense in the world
enshfined in verse—the pages of Parliamen-
tary debates are prose. S. Foote once per-
petrated a truly delightful patch of non-
sense prose worth quoting
She went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to
make an apple-pie, and at the same time a great
she-bear coming up the street pops its head into
the shop—-“ What! No soap?” So he died. She
imprudently married the barber, and there were
present the Pickaninnies, the Joblfllies, the Gazrnlies
and the Grand Panjandrum himself with the little
round button on top, and they all fell to playing
cat eh -as- catch- ea n till the gunpowder ran out at
the heels of their boots.
The Limerick, after the fashion set by
Lear, is most frequently made the vehicle
for rhymed nonsense. One of his best ran:
There was an old man in Thermopyla:
Who never did anything properly,'
But they said: “If vou choose
To boil eggs in your shoes
You cannot remain in Thermopylae.”
Kipling has not disdained to try his hand :
I dined with a friend in the East one day,
AA r ho had no window-sashes;
A sunbeam through the window came
And burnt his wife to ashes.
“John, sweep your mistress away,” said she,
“And bring fresh wine for your friend and me.”

The 15 World’s Records recently secured
by the Wolseley Ten’’ at Brooklands with
a standard chassis not only stand as an
unprecedented racing performance, but at
once place the “Wolseley” as the foremost
of all cars for private use.
A car that can run for 250 miles at an
average speed of 78-67 miles per hour
without any necessity for adjustment, and
without a stop, apart from minutes to
replenish with oil and petrol, is surely the
car to give unprecedented performance
under general conditions.
Whether it is a “Wolseley Ten,” “Fifteen”
or “Twenty” that most interests you the
marvellous responsiveness of the
“Wolseley” engine, the flexibility and ease
and simplicity of control, all make it a
delight to own and drive. Combined with
the “Wolseley” mechanical perfection is a
beauty of line and superb finish that denote
the high-water-mark of modern motor
design.
The “Wolseley Ten,” “Fifteen” and
“Twenty” are available for immediate
delivery.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Old Anthology.
In this calm cloister of sequestered words,
Sheltered by Song, a hundred poets sleep,
Lulled by each others’ lyrics as brown birds
Cradled to rest by shell-songs of the deep.
Cool Stillness sings her sister Silence here,
The white abundance of young Mother
Death,
Though hammer, horn and siren shriek so
near,
Busy with life blown hot from Morning’s
breath.
Soft Slumber tolls her little evening bells,
Bringing the poet-liost the peace each
sought;
While rhyme to rhyme in dreams for ever
tells
The leafy legend of primeval Thought.

The Sleeping Harbor.
Like one who watches without and waits
Till the moment of sleep and rest,
The slow tide creeps through the harbor
gates
On its silent, stealthy quest.
With riding lights at their bows and sterns—
Lone lights in the darkness wide —
Ship after ship swings round, and turns
At the will of the making tide.
As on it wanders ’neath pier and wharf,
And washes their piles, weed-tressed ;
A meteor flames, like a crimson scarf,
For a moment on night’s breast.
Ghost-like, as a spectral ship set free
To go where the doomed ships go,
A collier creeps through the dark to sea,
With her engines pulsing low.
The city sleeps and its people sleen.
And sleep • holds the winds in thrall;
But a sleepless Something seems to keep
Through the night wide watch o’er all.
Cold, cold and knowing nor care nor fret,
The stars on their march gleam white;
The Cross flames large, like a jewel set
On the spacious front of night.

Listen! the rending of hearts and of foun-
tains
Frozen and sealed through long winters of
sleep;
The life-throe of souls and the cleavage of
mountains,
Sonorous calling of deep unto deep!
Now does the avalanche fill with its thunder
Valleys whose pine forests tremble with
fear:
Now does the rainbow span Heaven with
wonder,
Arch of a conqueror bearing his spear.
Whirlwind of chariots blendingly flashing,
Shod with the terror and glory of change;
Portals thrown open and citadels crashing,
Wind-streaming cloud-banners, lovely and
strange;
Splendors of sunrise on white summits flush-
ing.
Mingling their winter with fire and with
blood;
Into sere channels wild ice-waters rushing,
Bearing fierce spoils on the crest of their
flood;
Anguish of birth that disrupts and delivers;
Flame on the grass where the sudden
flowers burn;
Precipice-leap of swift, snow-conceived
rivers;
Might of the sea-tides that ebb and re-
turn ;
Sword-stroke of light on the eyes of the sight-
less ;
Blood of hearts pierced in the torment of
love;
Strong wings that follow a day that is night-
less ;
Beak of a falcon and breast of a dove;
Rupture of graves, and the dead re-arisen
(Where m this trhimph, O Death, is your
sting?)—
Life, I have shattered the doors of your,
prison.
I am the Spring!

THE NEW WORLD-WAR.
David Gordon, M.L.C., of Adelaide, presi-
dent of the Associated Chambers of Com-
merce, in his opening address to the congress
at Hobart, said :
What is needed in Australia is a “peace offen-
sive,” not only in theory but in practice. In other
words, those who are for the Empire, the Common-
wealth, good government, social security and moral
uplift, as well as material progress, have got to
get together, stick together and fight together.
Australia has had a bellyful of political fight-
ing. The ancient imposture by which classes
and creeds are deliberately divided in the
interests of sections or of individuals who
care for no class, believe in no religion and
are interested in nothing but their own
advancement is the chief cause of the poli-
tical apathy so general to-day. What Aus-
tralia needs is not that the patriotic should
fight together, but that they should educate
together. The first requisite is to blanket
the truculent nuisances who still remain
in public life, and who never will be able
to think except in terms of party politics.
The chief strength of the Revolutionary
movement in this country—a country which
is no more in a position to indulge in revolu-
tions than Belgium or Holland —lies in the
mental weakness of our Conservatives in
public life. They require to be replaced by
those who are intellectually and morally
above the foul play that has become a rule
in our Parliamentary game—by representa-
tives who have studied the brief for the
existing industrial system, and who are
fitted temperamentally to speak as well as
think with moderation. The swashbuckling
era in politics is past. The Potts and
Slurk business is played out. These are
times when nothing will suffice but reason ;
and the colder the better.
* * * *
The logic of the case for Capital does not
require to be buttressed by irrelevancies
about sectarianism or disloyalty or any of
the other heavy-artillery pieces of the old-
time fighting politician. Accept the pro-
position that Australia must remain white
and the possessor of a white man’s standard
of comfort and ethics, and the case for Com-
munism collapses. For what is this alter-
native to the capitalistic system but a form
of economic disarmament which leaves the
yellow races the modern battleships and our-
selves the slow cruisers? And even if the
yellow races spared us —the yellow races
which are acquiring a taste for meat though
they have no pastoral country, and for com-
plicated American and European devices
calling for the raw products which they
lack and we possess—there would still re-
main the nations which are now paying for
the loss of the war. Germany, for example,
shows no more signs of an international
spirit than it does of a spirit of repentance.
It is unashamedly capitalistic. Its indus-
trial methods as a Republic do not differ
in any respect from those it employed to
such profitable purpose under the Hoiien-
zollerns. Take shipping, which has been
the keystone of the Fatherland’s commer-
cial arch ever since Bismarck engineered
the Zollverein. During the war Dernburg
drew up a bill for the Reconstruction of the
German Mercantile Marine, which was duly
put on the Imperial statute book. Its
object was to encourage shipowners by State
grants and otherwise to launch out and
recover Germany’s world-trade as soon as
possible after the declaration of peace. The
Hoiienzollerns have gone, and the revolu-
tionaries are in their places, but the prin-
ciples of the measure which became law in
1916 are operating just the same; and one
of their many fruits will be seen within the
next month or two when the first of the
German liners arrives in Australia with a
full cargo of German goods. The Germans
want now from us what they wanted in
1914 —wool, copper, hides and other raw
materials and foodstuffs —and they propose
to pay as they did in the past in those
things whose production makes nations rich,
populous, and, therefore, ready for further
wars of aggression. That is to say, finished
goods. There is nothing reprehensible in
such an ambition. It is not only natural
but inevitable —as inevitable as the ambition
of any individual, German or otherwise, to
rise in the world. The Bolsheviks of France
talked exactly the same humbug about
brotherhood and Communism at the end
of the 18tli century as those of Russia and
elsewhere have been talking lately. To-day
France is as grasping and as jingoistic as
Russia, which has already reverted to capi-
talism, promises to be to-morrow. So that
internationalism, Communism and the rest of
the aspirations which presuppose that man
is not a competitive animal are as imprac-
ticable as that other burst ideal, Freetrade.
All that a nation gets for lowering its guard
is a knock-out blow from the nearest rival
who has remained without illusions on the
subject of humanity’s capacity for massed
saintliness. And hence Capitalism—like the
policeman, the habit of locking away valu-
ables, and our countless other expressions of
distrust of the bona fides of the other fellow’
—survives and alw’ays must survive.
* * * *
Instead of fighting over it the desideratum
is that a sufficiently amicable spirit should
be created to enable all hands to get together
and restore Capitalism to health. When a
normal man gets a cold while saving his wife,
his family and himself from death by drown-
ing, he does not in his annoyance cut his
throat: he sets about the business of getting
well again. Capitalism is sick chiefly be-
cause it has just saved Australia from Prus-
sianism and has suffered in the process. One
of the reasons why goods are costing more
—the primary reason—is that money is
worth less. If a nation raises loans and
spends the cash on something which is pro-
ductive: —the opening up of a wheat area
or the creation of a Morwell power scheme
—it is able to pay the interest bill and per-
haps establish a sinking fund out of the
proceeds, and afterwards leave the new re-
venue-producer to posterity. Plainly in such
a case the currency will not suffer. But
where a nation has to raise money to buy
guns, shells and ten thousand other things
which destroy until they are themselves de-
stroyed, then (11 posterity can be left no-
thing but the debt, and (2) until fresh
wealth is created the interest bill must be
paid not in real but in printed money with-
out backing. And, unless the production
of real wealth is increased, every fresh
batch of these tokens that leaves the
machines will depreciate the exchange value
of its nredecessors and send nn prices until,
as in Russia, a cab-drive in 1922 comes to be
nominally as expensive as a palace wasin 1914.
Rouast, a French economist, compares every
collective agreement in the industrial sphere
to a composition in bankruptcy. A minority
is always dissatisfied, but the will of the
majority has to fie enforced to avoid the
bankrunting effects of a strike. In that
sense Australians, rich and pool*, are faced
with the necessity of signing a concordat
agreeing to produce hard and to save hard,
these being the necessary conditions pre-
cedent to restoring our currency to its old
value, and goods to their old prices. The
scheme calls for no more pugnacity between
section and section than was displayed in
a battalion in Flanders during the war. As
a matter of fact, it is the same fight trans-
ferred to another sphere. And the alterna-
tive is the same. Capitalist Germany wfill
have won the world-war on the day that
Internationalism is attempted on a big scale
in the British Empire.
THE GREEN STREETS OF PORT
HARLEQUIN.
At latest advices the grass was 7ft. high in
the fertile streets of Port Darwin, which
place, if not a capital, is at least a seat of
government —the grassiest seat the world
can show. It belongs to the Federal autho-
rity, and is a monument to an authority
which is so weak that it couldn’t become
weaker without ceasing altogether. Imme-
diately after South Aus. handed the Terri-
tory over as pavment, by way of land-grant,
for the railway that hasn’t been built,
Andrew Fisher encouraged the A.W.U. to
go in as caretakers. That body developed
the glad illusion that the “capitalist” is a
miracle-worker, capable of turning water
into wine and practising the marvel of the
loaves and fishes twice a day. Therefore it
was held that, though it was very necessary
for the worker to be naid, it was quite need-
less for him to work; and as his demands
went as high as 565. per day for youths of
18, the big meatworks were closed and have
remained closed for three years. Recently
hopes ran high, among those v/ho denounce
the capitalist with the greatest bitterness,
that he was coming back again ; but it was
a false alarm —he is having no more risks
at present, there being safer countries and
ones where more civility prevails. Similar
devices having closed other industries, the
population commenced to flit in search of
places where the capitalist was still avail-
able.
# # * #
The vast area which Fort Harlequin
stands for has had every chance that Labor
extremists of the most self-satisfied type
could give it. It has State railways, State
telegraphs, State steamers and State wharves,
and it had State pubs. It has got rid of the
private landlord, and, with infinitesimal ex-
ceptions, is a Government leasehold property.
It eliminated the big private capitalist to
all intents and purposes when the meat:
works closed and ships began to give the
port a wide berth, for the cattle-men of
the interior hardly trouble Fort Harlequin
now. It began to get rid of the minor capi-
talist in 1918. Since then, while savings
bank deposits in Victoria rose from £22 11s.
2d. to £3l 17s. Bd. per inhabitant, those of
the Territory fell from £2O ss. lid. to
£l3 13s. lid. And, but for the extraordi-
nary fact that the Territory’s working-
expenses are charged up to the other States,
the position w T ould certainly be much worse.
The great province secured job-control in the
most complete form till there ceased to be
jobs. It shipped its capitalistic Government
out of the country. By these and other
devices the wage-slave was released from
his chains. Up to that time the Territory
had been slowly rising, despite its isolation.
The people’s savings were respectable. In
recent years the population had grown.
Under State control the little railway auite
frequently showed a profit over working
expenses—a remarkable thing for such an
unfinished fragment to do, and much more
than two Sydney suburban lines and 22
N. S. Wales country ones achieve to-day.
Port Darwin had ships and it hadn’t begun
to dream of being Port Harlequin. The
Red “reformers” changed everything. What
if they had captured the Commonwealth
instead of a corner of it? Presumably they
would have made it all the same sort of
place, with the added horror that, there
being no capitalistic places for the popula-
tion to flee to, and no capitalistic Govern-
ments to take pity on them, the victims of
strikes and job-control would have died on
the premises, like the Bolsheviks and job-
controllers along the Volga, and every tufted
clod in the fertile streets of Port Harlequin
would conceal a skeleton. But not the
skeleton of the well-paid, soft-handed A.W.U.
emissary who ran the business. Such folk
have a knack of getting away in time. And
they don’t go on their travels penniless.
The persons who engineered or figure-
headed the ructions which changed the Ter-
ritory from a hopeful place with a future
to the dismal wreck it is are common nuis-
ances. None of them has the slightest repu-
tation except as a stopper of industry. They
are the parasites of the capitalist, because
they couldn’t draw salaries for stopping his
works if he didn’t exist, just as the informer
couldn’t live without someone to inform oh.
Though these people belong to the school
which talk's off-liandedly about “taking over”
and managing the industries of the nation,
they never took over or created or managed
a single industry to replace those they de-
stroyed, and being non-workers it is unlikely
they ever will. Those of them who have
wrecked Darwin pose as persons who have
done good service to the community ; and their
brethren ask to be given power elsewhere.
On this basis they make it quite clear that
it is no earthly use attempting to restore
the ruined Federal dependency unless some
means are found of putting them out of busi-
ness. All over the North, which is the best
part of Australia, the disease has spread,
and it is fully understood that if the capi-
talist comes back, which is unlikely, the old
crowd of non-producers ..will be on hand to
destroy his industry a second time. As they are
equally furious towards State industry and are
themselves apparently incapable of manu-
facturing a clothes-prop, the situation is of
the nature of a deadlock. Australia will
certainly not yet listen to any suggestion
that the salary of an “organiser” or other
kind of professional industry-interrupter
should not be regarded as lawful visible
means of support. But the time does seem
to have come when Australian workers and
their wives might consider whether they are
going to continue to be mere pawns in a
game plaved bv mostly un-Australian loafers
v"-ho make capital out of their ready tongues.
The ouestion is : Are the workers of Australia
and their wives going to exchange the shadow
of Revolution for the substance of that trade
unionism to which they owe so much? For
the S. African experience has shown once
more that, as ever, the Revolutionaries are
the uninn-wreckers. The history of Port
Harleouin shows, unfortunately, " that they
are job-wreckers as well.
SUGAR AT SIXPENCE A POUND.
The wealthy southern jam interest, helped
by one or two misguided editors who can’t
see beyond the boundaries of their Big City,
is making a violent attack on the Queens-
land sugar industry. During the war the
Queensland growers supplied Australia with
the cheapest sugar in the world and lost
heavily in the process. Barrels of ink have
been consumed in arguing that the, wheat
farmer is entitled to world parity, but dur-
ing the war and since the sugar-planter
never got world parity or anything like it.
The Bulletin gives me the opportunity to
put the case for the planter. And I shall
show that the case for the planter is the
case also for Australia.
W hile people in other countries were pay-
mg Is. Gel. per lb. the Australian consumer
got IA-grade Queensland sugar for 3d.
Per lb., and the rich jam interest benefited
correspondingly. Even to-day sugar is cheaper
m Australia than in Britain. Between 1915
and 1917 the planter had to sell his raw
sugar at the fixed price of £lB per ton.
which did not pay. In 1917, to stimulate
production, which had fallen heavily as com-
pared with the pre-war years, he was given
another £3 a ton. After the war, when the
Commonwealth Government had to make
large purchases abroad, it discovered, what
everyone in the industry had known for
years, that the grower’s produce had been
commandeered at much below its legitimate
value. Then it was that "an agreement was
made with the Queensland Government, cov-
ering the seasons of 1920-21-22, fixing
the price of raw sugar for the first year at
£3O 6s. J3d. per ton”—l quote the ever-
reliable Iynibbs —“any increase being limited
to the extra cost of production due to higher
wages.” The same authority states that the
wholesale price of refined sugar was raised to
£49 per ton and the retail price to 6d. per lb.
“in order to recoup the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment for the loss entailed in the purchase
at very high prices of large quantities of
foreign sugar, owing to the shortage'of the
Australian crop.” Had the Queensland
growers been judiciously encouraged at the
outset of the war there would have been no
such shortage, and Hughes wouldn’t have
had to pay through the nose for the foreign
article. It would be criminally unfair now
to make the grower pay for those contracts.
If a horse is starved and can’t in conse-
quence shift a load, and another horse has,
therefore, to be hired, would it be justice to
make.the starved horse pay for the hire by
stopping something out of his feed there-
after?
The consumers should understand, more-
over. that the producers don’t get the whole
of the 6d. per lb. that is charged over the
counter. They get only B|d. per lb. The
difference is absorbed by refining and in
making up the Commonwealth Government’s
loss in importing high-priced sugar from
overseas to make good the shortage in pro-
duction caused by the previous low rates.
To that extent the sixpence is only tem-
porary. and will be reducible as soon as
the old losses have been provided for. Ad-
mittedly, the.Sifd. which the growers get is
payable. It is. in fact, enabling us to make
up arrears and carry out much-needed im-
provements in mills and farms. Our posi-
tion in that respect is analogous to that of
the wheatgrowers, who were shamefully
underpaid for their 1915, 1910 and 1917
wheat and got high prices in 1919 and 1920.
Just as no fair-minded Australian objected
to paying 9s. a bushel or thereabouts for
wheat in 1920, no one with normally-decent
feelings will cavil at the sugar-planter, who
was similarly victimised in the early part
of the war, getting a bit of his own back.
The time will no doubt come when, provided
other costs fall, that of sugar will also
be reduced. But, for reasons to be men-
tioned. presently, it will be a national calam-
ity if it falls to a price that will not attract
new growers to the. North. And that is the
danger I foresee in a restoration of the
old free market, which otherwise, given rea-
sonable protection, against foreign “black”
sugar, has. everything to be said in its favor.
It is widely assumed in southern news-
papers that the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.
owns the sugar industry. That is not a
fact. Out of 40 sugar mills in Queensland
only five belong to the company. The south-
ern people should know also that the people
engaged in Queensland’s Far North are ex-
posed frequently to floods and cyclones,
which mean losses that have to be recouped,
and they have to undergo, in summer-time,
at least, a degree of humidity which renders
life uncomfortable. And there is the im-
portant question of the White Australia
policy. On this phase of the subject the
first Commonwealth Boyal Commission that
toured the sugar-plantations set down these
wise words:—
The problem of the sugar industry is not, save in
subordinate respects, a problem of industry, of
wealth or of production. It is primarily and essenti-
ally a problem of settlement and defence... .If the
ideal of a White Australia is to become an endur-
ing actuality, some means must be discovered of estab-
lishing industries within the tropical regions. So
long as these regions are unoccupied they are an
invitation to invasion as well as a source of strategic
weakness. Granted so much, it follows that the
supreme justification for the protection of the sugar
industry is the part it has contributed, and will, we
hope, continue to contribute, to the problems of
settlement and defence of the northern portion of
the continent.
In spite of the set-back it received during the
war, sugar-growing has become the one
great Australian industry north of Capri-
corn. As The Bulletin pointed out
recently, the Herbert electorate is one of the
few parts of Australia, outside the Big Cities,
that substantially increased their population
between 1911 and 1921. The census figures
show an addition of 15,000 persons (19.4
per cent.) during that period, war losses
notwithstanding. And, rightly handled, the
industry is still capable of great expansion.
There is any amount of good sugar land
available and new planters can be got. The
by-products, moreover, are valuable. One
of them is nationally important. If Aus-
tralia were at war, and the enemy’s navy
blocked the sea-routes, our very existence
might depend upon the production of power
alcohol from Queensland sugar-cane. Fuel
spirit so made is being used in Sydney at a
cost of 2s. 3d. per gallon. Here, rightly
handled, is the nucleus of a magnificent in-
dustry, but the necessity of manufacturing
substitutes for petrol, every gallon of which
is imported from countries which have looted
us for years, is not realised by those in
authority. They even object to the denature
ing of alcohol by the addition of benzol, which
is, or is about to be, made in Newcastle
(N.S.W.). In the larger interests of Aus-
tralia the southern people and politicians
will have to take a long view of the
sugar industry. They must not boggle
at paying a few shillings per annum per
head of population, if it homes to that, for
its maintenance and their security. Let them
always remember that the people engaged in
and about the sugar plantations are the
most important white garrison in the North.
Indeed, it is the one industry in sight capable
of luring men to the North and holding them
there.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N. S. Wales Elections.
Lycurgus warned his fellow-countrymen not
to use certain methods against their ene-
mies too persistently or their enemies might
get to use those methods too. It is a piece
of advice that the Nationalist wing of the
N. S. Wales Coalition would have done well
to take to heart during the late election
struggle. As a result of the solidest sec-
tarian campaign in the modern history
of the Ma State, the Protestant vote is
revealed as a first-class seat-winner. By the
use of it Tom Plenley beat his quota in
liyde by well over 6000 votes; Bruntnell,
late of the Salvation Army, polled nearly
18,000 primaries in Parramatta; and one
Ness, eminent in Orangeism, scored more in
Western Suburbs than an ex-Digger who is
both a Coalitionist and a Protestant, but
whose offence is that he is not a
vehement platform Protestant. Only one
Laborite adventured the full L.O.L. ticket
—W. J. Skelton, of Newcastle. lie scored
a primary vote which is surely a world’s
record, under the party government system,
for an Independent candidate. It was in-
evitable in a community which is over 20
per cent. R.C. that the “true blue” Pro-
testant candidate should evolve the “true
blue” It.C. ticket. In Eastern Suburbs a
young doctor named Fallon, who calls
himself a Democrat but advocated a policy
which, in its essentials, is that of the Eng-
lish Tory squires and parsons of Disraeli’s
day, secured more primary votes than any
Coalitionist but one. It is safe to say that
99 per cent, of them were Roman Catholic.
Under preferential voting, in a State of the
religious composition of N. S. Wales, there
should always, be room for one straight-out
R.C. member in five. There has never been
a Catholic party in any British Parliament
—Protestants were prominent even in the
old Irish Nationalist party as they are
among the Sinn Feiners—but on the Euro-
pean continent, and especially in Germany,
Catholic blocs are fixed institutions. They
are used to buy concessions in return for
support. A question that Australian poli-
ticians, Conservative and Radical, might
well ask themselves, before they decide to
make a convention of sectarianism, is
whether the country can afford it. We have
many live political issues; and the only reli-
gious ones that are ever mentioned have been
dead for generations. Can the life of the
liquor trade or the death of the basic-wage
system, for example, be satisfactorily left
to a sectarian vote? Yet these are the in-
sanities which are implied in many of the
N. S. Wales election results.

The Worm that Shows No Sign of
Turning.
Prime Minister Hughes, the fretful little
disturbance in a teacup that tries to look
like a gale, has made a pronouncement about
the Commonwealth shipping position which
is evidently meant to be dreadful. It ought
to rouse the Trades Hall to ribald mirth.
When the third “Bay” steamer —the Hobson
of that ilk- —arrives, the captain is to select
his own crew. If he isn’t allowed to do
so a fearful revenge will be taken—the
vessel will, be laid up ! It looks more like
a confession of ignominious defeat. The
Commonwealth’s first two “Bay” boats —
ruinously costly monsters—are at sea some-
where, the captain and officers under the
virtual command of some union delegate.
In the most outstanding case the vessel
got away very late under these conditions —
the crew on board to be discharged and a
new crew supplied by the union officials
without any right on the captain’s part to
reject ineflicients or undesirables; the boat-
swain to be appointed by the union; also
an officer who showed signs of disliking the
offhand proceedings to be victimised: dis-
missed, in fact. It was a very inefficient
crew of mixed nationalities that was sup-
plied, and the vessel became a very slow
ship. The appointment of officers by the
union or their election by the crew is ex-
pected to follow. If the next “Bay” is laid
up, in terms of the Government’s threat, the
Bolshevik authority, with two ships cap-
tured and the third turned into a useless
loss, can say that it has scored all along
the line, and that the nation, as owners,
hasn’t taken a trick. Indeed, the great idea
of laying up ships as a stern punishment of
men whose whole policy aims at the laying-
up of ships and other industries —putting
the nation on hunger-strike, so to speak—
would be laughable if it wasn’t also pitiable.
A less bird-like person than Hughes might
call Parliament together and get a law
against people who conspire to arrest
national industry and destroy national pro-
perty and revenue. The original McTier-
nan Profiteering Bill had robust clauses, all
passed by the N. S. Wales Assembly, against
the person who “retained in his possession
or under his control any necessary commo-
dity,” such as a ship. (Three years’ penal
servitude.) Also against any “supplier of
any necessary service” (such as service in
the capacity of sailor, fireman or engineer)
who didn’t serve when called on for the
fixed price and no more. (Three years’
penal servitude.) The bill w r as simply
dotted over with provisions against restraint
of trade, half of which, if applied to the
malignant restrainers of the Commonwealth
shipping trade, would make them flee in
disguise to the bush. Australia wants a
less toothless watchdog than Hughes in a
serious - emergency.

Where Are We?
Peter Airey writes from Queensland
It is no use blinking facts. Separate representa-
tion in the League of Nations plainly signified that
Canada, Australia and South Africa are independent
States —a position but little modified by the fact
of a common allegiance. Ireland will shortly be in
the same position, and India is steadily—sometimes
violently—drifting thitherward. From being an
Empire we have resolved ourselves into a loose-
jointed Alliance. This Alliance will defend its
members in case any one Is attacked; but even that
will be strictly dependent on the State attacked being
able to show a community of interests. Thus gigantic
revolution has just taken place under our very eyes,
and' the vast majority of people don’t seem to know
anything about it. So far is this practical inde-
pendence of the allied British Dominions recognised
that if Australia or Canada desired to secede to-
morrow England would not lift a hand or fire a gun
to prevent it. It was admitted tacitly during the
discussions on the Irish question that they can do
so if they please.
To Canada, backed as she would be in case of an
attack from any Asiatic Power, by a neighboring
white nation nearly 120 millions strong, this matter
of her practically complete independence may not
be highly critical; but to Australia it is far other-
wise. The White Australia doctrine, when held by
a continent which is near to China, close to Jajian,
and only a day or two away from India, will in all
probability some day want defending by an efficient
army, a competent navy and air-fieet, and, most of
all, by a numerous population. At present we
look to Britain to defend us in this position, and
Britain, grateful for our help in the World War,
and not unmindful of our dead in Gallipoli and
Prance, would for some time yet lend us her pro-
tecting arm. But a day is rapidly approaching
when Indian opinion is going to be a large if not a
dominating factor in the councils of Britain on
this question. And if India achieves self-govern-
ment in the near future, and does not secure Eng-
land’s complete sympathy in this matter of recog-
nition of the colored man as an equal within the
bounds of the British Alliance of Nations, she may
turn to Japan, which will not hesitate to assist her
in some way or othev. And India and Japan
between them number over 400 millions.
We have also to bear in mind that the glamor of
Empire no longer besets the minds of any great num-
ber of English electors. Indeed, the working-man has
been asking if the risks involved in maintaining this
gorgeous fabric of Empire are, really worth while.
He has just emerged from a great war wherein
nearly a million of his comrades perished. He
sees that the ownership of India compels Britain to
keep nearly 100,000 of her best troops in the field,
and that she may be involved any day in a fresh
war in order to maintain her hold on the possession.
But to-day there are no compensating tributes from
subsidiary nabobs and rajahs; Indian trade is open
to all the world, and the British Parliament is bur-
dened by a heavy load for defence and the main-
tenance of Order from which it is very doubtful if
the British taxpayer gets anything like an equivalent
quid pro quo. Is it likely that the British elector
is going to worry himself to death about resisting
Indian claims to self-government, or Indian claims
to equal recognition throughout the Dominions, when
his return is practically nil ? Sir Sidney Low, in
a recent article from the English standpoint, puts
another case: “The Englishman may settle, take up
land, invest money, in Australia. So he may in
Argentina. His British citizenship does little more
for him in one place than in the other. Last year
the Queensland Parliament passed an Act which
inflicted severe injustice on certain English investors.
The Imperial Government admitted the wrong, but
declined to veto the Act. If the sovereign State of
Queensland chooses to break its contracts it must be
permitted to do so. The aggrieved Britisli investors
could have been in no worse position if they had
lent their money to a South American Republic.
They might have been better off; for the Foreign
Office might have brought pressure to bear on the
defaulting Government by threatening to break off
diplomatic relations. With a sovereign State of the
British Commonwealth we cannot break off rela-
tions ; we cannot even remonstrate for fear of (riving
offence. Meanwhile our British elector may reflect
that he is bearing the cost of the British Navy, which
enables some Queenslanders to keep to them-
selves a territory three times as large as Germany,
with tens of millions of Asiatics eager to pour in.
And the aforesaid Briton may ask himself why
exactly he should go on doing this, or what disad-
vantage would come to him if he failed to do it.”
There is no answering Sir Sidney Low's presentment
of this phase of the case. If Australia were a republic
to-morrow, cut adrift absolutely from the Motherland,
the average Britisher would not be one jot worse off;
the English investor would be just as secure (or
insecure) as he is to-day; trade would flow on in
the old channels. But as to whether Australia would
be as secure or as immune from aggression as here-
tofore is quite another question. And whether
the outside world would long continue to tolerate
an attitude which says “We can’t populate this
country ourselves and we won’t let anybody else do
so” is a matter concerning which a sane man is
apt to feeling exceedingly dubious, t ,
The world-resounding title “the British Empire’
has now to give way to “the Community of Nations
known as the British Empire.” This “Community
of Nations” is a very fine thing so long as it rests
on a community of interest. But it is hard to see
what community of interest India has in the M hite
Australia doctrine, and it is hard to see why the
British elector should involve himself in a deadly
quarrel with one part of the one-time Empire in
order to support another part that gives him no
particular preferences and that claims the right even
to repudiate its financial obligations to him when
occasion arises. Meantime the Australian had better
cast away his blinkers, and look the situation straight
in the eyes. For we are face to face with a new
world, and* like the coneys in the rocks, we are
but a little people, largely unaware of our littleness.
The Application of the Referendum
Principle.
There was a time when the Christian reli-
gion would have been disallowed by a smash-
ing majority if a referendum had been taken
about it. There still are religions in dif-
ferent parts of the world wdiich would be
abolished if it was merely a question of
taking local votes, pro or con., concerning
them. Jazzing, bookmakers, smoking on the
part of girls, mixed bathing and a thousand
other institutions are destructible on similar
lines. Obviously, then, there must be some
test by which reasonable people may decide
whether or no an institution or trade or
habit should he required to stand on trial
for its life before Demos as represented by
the ballot-box. If not, Jones would have
hardly done illegalising the sin which
Brown was inclined to, ere Brown would
have started, by way of retaliation, to make
a criminal offence of the indulge:. " ' lo h
•Tones was trying to compound, inc
tical standard in these matters is enforce-
ability. And enforceability is entirely a
matter of the public conscience being behind
the new law. Nothing could have been more
hateful to the freedom-loving English than
conscription. Yet it is certain they would
have voted for it if the law’ of the land
had not offered a quicker way of bringing
it to pass; and from the moment the system
started to work to the day it died the eva-
sions were numerically negligible. The Brit-
ish Parliament made pigeon-shooting illegal
at the end of last year, and it is already as
dead as bear-baiting. An example of the con-
trary kind is that collusion which since the in-
troduction of desertion as a ground for divorce
has been aided and abetted by every law r yer
and winked at by every Judge; and this
though the King's Proctor still exists
to stop the practice. So the real test in
the matter of the liquor referendum is not
concerned with the principles of democracy.
The basic question is: Can prohibition be
shown to be enforceable? In the U.S.A. it
has been nominally in operation for over
two years. Yet the New York Globe, of
January 7 last accused the city in which
it lives of being “wringing wet”; and it
joined in the indictment Buffalo, Rochester,
Syracuse, Albany and other cities. Further :
The prohibition enforcement laws have demoralised
the police force in mafay instances; thief catching
and the prevention of burglaries and hold-ups has
given way to watching for evidence of liquor selling ;
and hundreds of new avenues of graft have been
opened. Then, too, the prohibition cases have clut-
tered the court calendar, and thieves, highwaymen,
burglars, and others guilty of clime and violence
have escaped trial for months while they were out on
bail and plying their trade with little or no attempt
at concealment.
Judging by the example of the only civilised
country where prohibition has been tried on
the grand scale, its most marked effect is to
cause law-breaking to be regarded as a joke.
There are, then, things that a democracy
cannot afford to apply the referendum to.
Plainly it cannot afford to apply it to the
suppression of a religious sect. And the
U.S. experience is deepening the suspicion
that prohibition is another of the things—
at any rate, until the Drys have carried their
propaganda much farther than they have
yet been able to do.

How Industries Are Choked.
Cockatoo Dock: (Sydney) is now making
the tail-end of a precarious living by spin-
ning out the completion of a cruiser. This
floating implement of war, which fits in
badly with, the great disarmament policy,
has dawdled on its way so long that it is
a species of ghost already. When it is out
of hand the closure of the dock is likely to
be pretty nearly complete, unless it starts
making armor and bows and arrows for
Crusaders and sending them back into the
twelfth century by time machine. Lately
there were added up the amounts of one day’s
wage for six skilled men (six different sorts)
and a laborer in the iron industry, and the
total was 775. in England, 104 s. 3d.
in the United States and 133 s 2d. for much
shorter hours in Australia. So ships built
here under present conditions can’t pay for
their keen, with the high rate of seamen’s
wages added to the other high things, unless
they charge freights that will eat up the
whole cargo when they carry wheat to Eng-
land, and return freights that will put up
the cost of living until it is out of sight.
Even if Tom Walsii would let them go to
sea it isn’t worth while to send them. Nor
is the prospect of cheaper local ships cheer-
ful. Certainly the Red party might turn
Sydney into a shambles, all blood and beer
and bowels, without making building any
cheaper. Bowels never made any construc-
tive job cheaper —unless they were the
bowels of the Bolsheviks themselves. The
closure of the Mount Lyell mine is also
in progress, and now the Sulphide Cor-
poration’s Cockle Creek smelters are to be
added to a list of stoppages that is already
the length of a Dooley oration. With these
smelters the increase in the price of coal was
the last straw. Last year, it is reported with
pride, N. S. Wales produced 10,793,387 tons
of coal worth 16s. lOd. per ton at the pit-
mouth —that was the price charged for it.
As the output is almost all used locally, or
for bunkering steamers which can’t help
themselves, there is no reason why the figure
should not be made 365. lOd. —except that,
it plays the devil with the cost of living, and
that there is a point at which the rise makes
factories close and there is no living. And
when factories close other enterprises are
knocked out. Coal-mining, which makes its
pile by profiteering our own people, now
stands' for nearly two-thirds of the value of
the mineral income of the Ma State, and
may yet stand for practically all of it. Giddy
revolutionaries have a project by which “the
men engaged in the industry” are to “take over”
the mines, put up the price, just produce
enough coal to make a happy living and let
people go without the rest. It is about time
other workmen realised what this “taking
over” of the mines by the mine workmen
led by Willis would mean. The product of
the Sulphide Corporation, for instance, has
to be sold in competition with the markets
of the world. It can’t put up the price of
what it has to sell —lead, silver and so on—
at its own sweet will. But if the coal-miner
can at his sweet will put up the price of
what the Sulphide. Corporation has to buy,
then the time inevitably comes when, if the
coal-miner is badly led —as he is—produc-
tion by the Corporation becomes impossible.
This is the position that, has now been
reached. And the same thing applies to the
Mt. Lyell. Indeed, from one point of view
the situation so far as Lyell is concerned
is more serious, because once the old mine
is flooded it is as certain as anything can
be that it will never be worked as a copper
proposition again. And this means that the
life of the township which has grown up
around the mines will be much shortened,
to the loss, of course, of the working miners
and others who have built their .homes there.
An awful lot of rubbish has been and still
is talked about the brotherhood of labor. The
solemn truth is that one body of labor, skil-
fully handled, may be fairly charged with
more of the responsibility for poor wages,
lone hours and unemployment amonsr other
bodies of labor than all the capitalists in
the world. And it is to be noted that the
labor body which is waxing fat is invari-
ably the body whose leaders talk loudest
about labor solidarity.
The New Rule in Samoa.
“.J.C.,” afteb feeling Samoa’s pulse
The real trouble with Samoa lies in the choice of
men the M.L. Government sends there. The subordi-
nates are well enough, but the two or three Adminis-
trators that so far have bossed the place have been
unfitted for the job. First there was a farmer-colonel
from Otago, who antagonised everybody; a locum
ten ms, a kind of general; next a lawyer-colonel—•
all good enough in their own callings, but utterly
unqualified by training and temperament for the
ticklish task of controlling and conciliating a proud,
sensitive race of Maori-Polynesians. Such a position
calls for a man with some • interest in ethnology,
some sympathy with native thought and aspirations,
and a good grounding in Maori-Polynesian tongues.
An ideal man for the place would have been S.
Percy Smith, formerly Surveyor-General of M.L.,
and the foremost living authority on Polynesian
history and migrations; but he is in his eighties,
and has long retired from active work. The only
man now in the Government service I know who
is really fitted for the job is Dr. Peter Buck
(Te Rangihiroa), wdth Gallipoli and Western Front
service, and now a Government Health Officer. Of
Maori blood himself, schooled in politics and in
anthropology and kindred sciences, and with an
engaging and tactful personality, there is no one
better qualified, except Dr. Pomake —and he is a
Minister of the Crown.
The bossy kind of official is the worst kind; the
islanders, for all their kindliness and essential
chivalry and courtesy, bitterly resent any attempt
at dragooning. As for the papalangi residents, they
are readily enough conciliated by the right kind of
man, and they naturally expect some little say in
the local government. A quarter of a century ago
M.L. and Australia were popular enough among the
Samoans; the people of both races repeatedly asked
for annexation by Maoriland on behalf of Britain.
What change in sentiment there is has been due
entirety to unwise selection of officials, to big talk
about “educating” the Samoan, and to the duty of
laboring on the plantations for the papalangi. Dr.
Sole, when he was Governor of Samoa, was a
favorite with Samoans and British as well as . his
own countrymen, and he made a success of his
administration, a fact which is not forgotten in Apia.
He was a man of science, too, and a writer, not a
mere official. Maoriland has every chance of con-
trolling Samoa with equal satisfaction if it only
sends the right kind of men; it would be a ghastly
mistake to hand the job over to Britain’s Colonial
Office, to provide a billet for some English aristo
eratic incompetent.
Wives and Mothers—and Some Others.
The reflections of an old physician:—
It is woman’s fate to be a “young man’s mis-
tress, a middle-aged man’s comrade, and an old
man’s nifrse.” When a normal young couple marry
the man’s passions are so much stronger than the
woman’s that he must perforce treat her, as a mis-
tress, with whatever idealism he begins. It is not
his fault, poor wretch —he did not make himself. As
sexual desire weakens with middle-age the period of
loyal and delightful comradeship comes on, which is
probably the best part of married life, though it is
the time when a wife must be prepared to fight lest
some more charming female should steal her poor
innocent from her side. When the man’s heart and
kidneys begin to go. which is probably the price we
pay for our lordly manhood, then the slower-living
female becomes the nurse to her sick old husband.
Love does not mean the same thing to each. True,
sometimes a woman is born with passions like a
man’s, but then she becomes an Empress Catherine
or a prostitute. The normal woman never prostitutes her-
self—the trade is too disgusting to her. Prostitutes are
so because they like it; what makes the discovery
difficult is that women never tell the truth about
themselves. They cling to a sense of self-respect—
it is the last thing in life that leaves them ; hence
a woman seldom commits suicide in a disfiguring
manner, and hence it is difficult to dogmatise about
what love exactly means to her, though probably to
the virgin it means simply a general feeling of
eroticism satisfied by cuddling, hugging, hero-
worship and sentimentality. More than that shocks
and terrifies her —unless Fate has doomed her to
something worse.
When a woman is sexless —like, for instance, Joan
of Arc —the forces which should turn her into a
normal female drive her to furious religious zeal, and
she is quite ready to be burnt at the stake for them.
There is unquestionably a strong relationship between
the sexual forces and the religious. That is why
women are so much more religious than men; the
forces which spend themselves in men by “love”
drive a woman to church. But I must emphasise
that “love” means something quite different to each
sex.
A Tribal Troubled Land.
James Edmond surveys Irish history:—
It will be a quaint happening if the British oppres-
sor, before he is quite cut of Ireland, amid the re-
joicings of the inhabitants, is called back to arbitrate
and keep the peace—or the fragment, if there isn't
enough left to be worth calling the other thing.
Though the day of . liberty is still young something
suggestive of that mirthful tragedy has already hap-
pened at Limerick, where the sectarian question or
the racial question doesn’t arise, the population of
the county being 96 per cent. Roman Catholic and
its unanimous brogue beyond suspicion. The Shan-
nonside city was occupied by the official army of the
Irish Free State, and by the rebel or mutinous army
of De Valera, the Spanish-Irish person from New
York whom the Irish took on as President. So the little
British garrison, which was in process of evacuation,
had to be retained for a while to keep the clans apart
and save South Ireland from needless blankshed.
Something not widely different has befallen at
various other places.
The recognised Free State Government, led. by
Griffith and Collins, isn’t heard of so much as
might be expected in the case of a vigorous young
Administration. It certainty has an army, but as to
whether it is larger, more devoted and better officered
than that of ex-President De Valera not very much
is known. Seeing that the Free State commander
lately sent a raiding expedition into Ulster on his
own initiative, the real ownership of the Free State
army may also be less certain than it should be.
Including the legions of Britain (which are being
withdrawn when they are not required to keep the
two factions apart), the Ulster forces (presumably
there are some) and the two Southern armies, the
little island is rather overcrowded with soldiery.
The disgruntled ex-President was and still is
(unless the local Smuts has taken some sudden
measures during the last few hours) preaching a
furious civil war for “the re-establishment of the
Republic” and the recovery of his job. He is play-
ing the part of Gandhi with improvements. Accord-
ing to him, “if the treaty is ratified” —that is to
say, if the majority approves of the Free State and
votes accordingly—“you who propose freedom”—and
the rule of the minority—“must march over the dead
bodies of your own brothers. You must wade through
Irish blood.” It almost looks as if peaceful Irish
self-government might be off before it is realty on.
At any rate, the Griffith-Collins Ministry seem
rather doubtful of its ability to cope with the situa-
tion. Possibly the fidelity of the I.F.S. array is
what it is worried about.
Ireland, according to its own records, has always
had a casual way with rulers. Its old historians
claim that 169 High Kings can be traced between
1285 b.c. (160 years before Samson) and the time
of Christ, and that 150 of them died by violence,
including poison. From the birth of Christ to the
nominal Conquest the names of the kings are re-
corded. There were 77 of them whom their his-
torians summed up rather dismally. Seven were
“killed by his successor”; one “poisoned by his

sister”; one was “murdered by the Irish plebeians ot
Connaught” ; 17 died in battle; 21 are set down as
just “killed” or “slain,” and in two more cases it is
mentioned that there was a conspiracy and various
persons at the slaying-; a solitary monarch was
choked; one was thrown into a lake, and one was
suffocated in a bog. Eight are positively recorded
as having died peacefully while still kings. The rest
of the list is filled in by drownings, kings who went
into monasteries (probably for good reason), the
dethroned and the unaccounted for. The official
finish came through nobody remembering to appoint
a successor to the king who became a monk in 1198
after the nominal Conquest, he being driven thereto
by his sons.
There were 400 years and more between the
nominal Conquest and the real one, but the restless
and tribal and non-Parliamentary habit of throwing
kings into lakes and bogs didn’t make for cohesion.
Scotland and Ireland were fatherless and under the
English oppressor at the same time—the former, to
all appearance, the more effectually conquered, and
certainly with far less resources. But things panned
out on widely different lines. Scotland secured the
services of a Norman noble called Bruce from the
Labor Bureau, and made so effective a Scotsman out
of him that his descendants are kings in Edinburgh,
Dublin and London and emperors in Delhi to this
day. The idea seemed so good that a brother Bruce,
a mighty man of war and ready to take a throne
anywhere outside perdition, was invited to play the
same part in Ireland, and for a while affaire against
the Sassenach went well. But all bright Irish
schemes had a habit of crumbling because of the
tribal frame of mind which made it impossible for
Morragh of the Axes to be long on the same side
with his hereditary enemy Murrtagh of the Blood-
Tub, while Turlough of the Banshees would lend a
certain amount of countenance to almost any party
that disliked both of them. So a, practically aban-
doned king, who might have proved valuable, became
a dead king, ■ and no other man of the same size
ever offered for the job again.
Even in the days of the late Tudors, when it
looked as if the real Conquest was coming at last
and the chances of independence were very thin,
there was the same lack of cohesion and leadership.
Shane O’Neill, of Tyrone, was one of the last hopes,
and he made peace with the English enemy so that
he might have his hands free for a lifelong squabble
with the Scots and the O’Donnells. He didn’t im-
prove things when he burst what might have been a
league by stealing his neighbor’s wife. Almost every
Irish leader since then, whether he was a wife-stealer
or not, has been up against internal dissension, the
same as Shane O’Neill.
Man being what environment and his ancestors
made him, with an occasional leg-up from Provi-
dence, nothing is gained by condemning the clan
habit or the tribal frame of mind. Still it tends to
a vast increase of feud and assassination, for there
is a great tendency to disorder and crime along an
ill-guarded and- ill-defined border. This happens
even when frontiers are 600 miles apart; but when
it is possible for the division lines of three embit-
tered races to be in one street, the pace exceeds the
speed limit. The tribes are poor in the art of open
warfare for want of means to organise and lack of
room to manoeuvre. Consequently they have to be
skilled at lying in wait and at hurried slaying.
This method of government doesn’t help along the
Parliamentary institution much; and it makes ri
shortage of friends and allies in the day of trouble.
A recognised hereditary king, even if he is a mad,
bad cipher of the old Valois sort, ruling over a
definite State, could at least sign binding treaties
and buy help. The tribal people, whether Israelites
or Irish or Scottish Highlanders or Corsicans, have
a habit of being conquered, partly because of then-
separatism and partly because they are considered
rather a bore. Also they are rather outside world
movements such as the Crusades and the Renaissance
and the Great Explorations. There were strong and
gallant gentlemen of Tipperary who might have been
in Jerusalem ahead of Godfrey’ de Bouillon, or in
the West Indies before Columbus, or even in Tophet
before that great but unappreciated explorer Cain.
only it was impossible to leave the piano and gramo-
phone unguarded in a land where the High King
was either a shadow or a mangled corpse or a
usurper, and generally all three.
Whether the tribal instinct goes with cumbrous spell-
ing is hard to say. But among the 240 kings (mostly
sudden-death kings) between Samson and Henry’ Plan-
tagenet, there were included Fearaidiiach-Fion-
fychtna, Ftachadh-Fion, Fiaciiadh-Fionoiiudh,
Feidiilimtiidh, Eochaidh-Gunait, Eochaidh-Moidh-
Tuathal-Maolgarbh, Scibhne-Meain, Fionachta-
Fleadha, Flaithbheartaoii, Loinosf.ach, Seachna-
sacii and Dathy. These things are hard to put up
with and a serious responsibility. But even if the
spelling was twice as bad it wouldn’t in itself justify
the dreadful ends these gentlemen came to. The list
of names begins, as already hinted, in the year a.d. 4,
and six out of the first seven kings were murdered
(four by “his successor,” so the homicide was fully
qualified to succeed), while the odd one was merely
slain in civil war. This early-morning start dissi-
pates the further idea that demoralising English
influences had anything to do with the case. Eng-
lish influences amounted to very little in a.d. 4 or
even a.d. 51,.
The Grog- that Blossoms.
In 1920-21, according to the industrious J.
D. Merson. Australia spent £29,407,536
(£5 Bs. Bd. per head) in the purchase of
spirituous and fermented liquors. It laved
its throat with 1,403.317 Imperial gallons
of wine, 1,937,26 S of whisky, brandy, gin
and kindred beverages with a stick in them.
and 66,438,273 of beer. The revenue col-
lected from this source by the various Gov-
ernments, State and Federal, amounted to
£8,310,420. Where the paid fanatic rages
these figures will be cited in support of
the familiar contention that the Austra-
lians are a nation of drunkards who, with-
out the imported panacea of compulsory
abstinence, will be lost. Actually they show
that the people, as a whole, are increas-
ingly temperate, although there is notori-
ously a minority that drinks too much. As
compared with 1939-20 there was a small
increase (21,848 gallons) in the consump-
tion of wine, but the beer bill diminished
by 3.832.753 gallons and the spirits account
by 339.245. A greater quantity, all told,
was mopped up in 1913, when the population
was 590,716 less. The decline in the absorp-
tion of spirits is most remarkable. In 1901
3,790.710 people drank 3.613.384 gallons.
In 1920-21 5,412,318 people managed with
1,937.268 gallons. Of wine, moreover, only
171.244 more gallons were drunk in 1920-21
than in the first year of the century. Cer-
tainly the beer figures went up 23.822 831
gallons, but that increase, great as it seems,
only kept pace with the increase of popula-
tion. And, anyhow, the gain in quantity
was balanced by the loss in alcoholic
strength. Whereas there were 4,091.455 gal-
lons of absolute alcohol in the 47.460.709
gallons of liquor swallowed in 1901, there
were only 3.801,579 gallons in the far
greater quantity (69,778.858 gallons) that
went down the public throat last year. This
is a sore point with seasoned topers, but
it has an important bearing on the question
whether the community has become more
bibulous, as the prohibitionists assert, or
more sober, as most reasonable people be-
CUTTING OUT THE CAPITALIST,

lieve. Britain is the country for staggering
drink bills. In 1920 the United Kingdom
(pop. 47,000,000, or not nine times that of
Australia) assimilated liquor to the value of
£469,700,000, which was more than the
amount of the pensions arising out of the
war, plus the interest on the national debt.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer’s cut was
£197.000,000. Of absolute alcohol the con-
sumption was approximately 69,500,000 gal-
lons, or more than 18 times the Australian
quantity. In the presence of these stupen-
dous statistics the Commonwealth figures
fade into insignificance. Also, the attempt
to show that the Australians are a race of
sots who can only be saved from blue-nosed
ruin by the Yankee nostrum fails ludicrously.
A number of Australian visitors were re-
cently held up on board ship at San Fran-
cisco on suspicion of wanting to settle in
the. United States, and pollute it with
their Australian presence. They were re-
leased on proving that they were only tem-
porary evils and didn’t propose to con-
taminate Uncle Sam for all time. Other-
wise they would have been shut out, the
Australian quota for the month (about 25)
having apparently been exhausted. If this
country had another kind of Prime Minister
at the head of affairs the Republic’s quota
idea might suggest an inspiration. When
a certain number of peonle of any nation-
ality (only two or three hundred in
Australia’s case) have entered the G.
Washington land in the course of the year
all others are barred. The obvious retort
is to enact that when as much value in
goods has been received from any country
this year as that country took from Aus-
tralia last year, all further goods from the
said country shall be barred until next
January 1. That would give friendly
nations a show, and unfriendly or grasping
ones a hint to go on with.
“X2X” has no respect for age :
It is not only those just commencing their studies
who are adversely affected by the absurd regulations
governing the matriculation examinations of most
of our Universities, but frequently much older men
and women as well. It often happens that a
young man sets out to study, say, chemistry, in
circumstances which do not permit of his entering
a University. What he does, mostly, is to take a
short course at a technical college or school of
mines, and, having acquired a diploma, look around
for a job. Thereafter he amplifies his knowledge by
additional night courses in technical schools, or by
work at home, together with the practical experience
he gains in his employment, until eventually he
becomes an acknowledged authority on the particu-
lar phase of chemistry in which he has specialised.
The Institute of Chemists, the Chemical Society and
various kindred associations eagerly welcome him
and defer to his opinion in his specialty. At this
stage, particularly if he be still young In years,
he may decide to go for a University degree—say a
B.Sc. —and then it is that he collides violently with
a set of archaic regulations that look as though they
were drawn up with the express purpose of keeping
him out. He finds that before he can even begin a
course of study, he must pass an examination in six
or seven school subjects, such as English history
and literature, Latin, mathematics, French. German,
geography, etc. In most cases his acquaintance with
these elementary branches of learning finished when
he left school, which means that it is necessary for
him to spend a couple of years preparing for the
examination, and, in addition, the exam, conditions
are such as to put him to as much trouble and
inconvenience as possible. The majority abandon
the idea on making this discovery, for it means
that, instead of the course for the B.Sc. degree
taking them three years, it runs to five or six. But
should any persevere and succeed in passing the
examination, they are due to make a couple more
discoveries of a similar kind, one of which is that,
should they have sat for examination in any science
subjects in the matriculation or leaving examination,
as most of them naturally do, the work of this first
University year is only to the standard of that in
which they have passed. For one reason and another
they nearly all get discouraged and give it up, either
deciding to go without the degree altogether—which
means that any 20-year-old graduate, who was pro-
bably in long clothes when the others were working
in laboratories, has a status greatly superior to theirs
—or else they go to some English or American Uni-
versity, which receives them with open arms, exempts
them from the ordinary routine course, and places at
their disposal a laboratory in which they may pre-
pare the couple of years’ work required for their thesis
for the degree. One result of this is that very often
they decide to remain in the country which seems
genuinely glad to get them, and so are lost to Aus-
tralia, a land which has so few chemists and techno-
logists that she cannot afford to lose one of them.
What is urgently needed is a clean sweep of the grev-
whiskered, dpddering old shellback persons who mostly
predominate on the controlling boards here and
their replacement with younger and more vigorous
men, who are not only native-born and imbued with
Australian ideals, but who look upon the Universities
as national centres for the encouragement of learn-
ing, instead of places to be run on the lines of a
boys’ public school.
“Lex” : Three centuries ago Sir Thomas
Gresham laid down his law that “bad money
drives out good money.” And the principle
applies to more than currency. In N. S
Wales, for example, the blackguardly bar-
risters threaten presently to drive out the
decent ones, as the blackguardly politician
has already begun to drive out’ his decent
colleagues. Rich litigants in cases where
“testing for credit” is likely to be resorted
to-—in plain English, where the nature of
the case provides opportunities for mud-
slinging—are beginning to compete for the
recognised hurlers of offal. They may not
want to use them : the idea may only be to
silence them. But the ultimate effect is
bound to be to encourage others who are
desirous of earning money easily to adopt the
methods which have proved so profitable to
their seniors. The Bar Council lacks the
powers of such a body as the B.M.A. to
punish breaches of etiquette, as is shown,
for example, by the fact that in N. S. Wales
many barristers are as freely advertised in
the daily press as any grocer. But the
Judges can always interfere in the public
interest and for the protection of the good
name of the legal profession. One refusal
by the Bench to “see” counsel on the ground
that he was using the Court for a form of
blackmail would arouse more enthusiasm
amongst decent barristers and amongst pros-
pective witnesses and litigants than a thou-
sand stern rebukes to advocates who appear
“improperly dressed.”

Few men as tender-hearted as Judge
Edmunds (N.S.W.) have caused half as
much misery—in Australia, at any rate.
His Honor never could resist a hard-luck
tale, and when the High Court Judges would
have nothing to do with Hughes’s scheme
for keeping work going in the coal-mines by
authorising both owners and miners to take
a bigger bite out of the public, Hughes
naturally fell back on Edmunds : and
Edmunds recorded the necessary recommen-
dation. Australian industry has never been
the same since; for the “settlement” demor-
alised the work-people and did no good to
the other side. It offered a premium for
holding up industry, and piled up the costs
in other lines until now many of them can’t
carry on. On top of that Judge Edmunds
was responsible for the amazing Broken
Hill award, whose last fruit has been the
closing of the Sulphide Corp. Smelters.
Under this award the tonnage of concen-
trates fell, until it was only half of what was
formerly produced. In 1936 the co. had
1500 tons of lead concentrates and ores to
smelt per week. In 3917 it could get only
3100 tons. In despair the co. closed down.
It made another attempt lately; but as it
found the greatest difficulty in maintaining
an output of 650 tons per week the attempt
had to be abandoned. The great heart that
starts monkeying with the vast, complicated
industrial machine is liable to be a great
calamity,
“Greb” : “Not so long ago,” says “Hanno”
(B. 23/3/’22), “a man with syphilitic sores
on his fingers who turned up at the [Mel-
bourne] clinic for treatment, . said he . was
a barber in the city.” Here is an authentic
Sydney case. B. (aged 27) developed a sore
throat on his honeymoon. Shortly after his
return he went to his suburban doctor, who,
after a brief inspection, dragged him to a
city specialist. The second man confirmed
the worst suspicions of the first. “But it’s
impossible!” groaned the husband, and told
a convincing story of sustained rectitude.
“Nevertheless,” insisted the specialist, "you
have been suffering for perhaps nine months,
and the disease has now reached the tertiary
stage.” Close cross-examination brought
out the fact that a little sore —“something
like a wart”—had appeared on the patient’s
neck about a year before, but had eventually
gone away of its own accord. It had arrived
a few weeks after a shave, in the course of
which the barber had staunched the bicod
from a small cut. The barber was traced
and found to be in a worse way than his
victim; and his story, which the specialist
believed, was that he had done nothing to
earn the horror that had overtaken him. and
that he had not even been vouchsafed the
other’s warning in the form of a < primary
sore. Both cases were remarkably virulent —
as almost always happens with innocent in-
fections.

POLITICAL
POINTS
For rampant sectarianism and legalised
corruption the N. S. Wales election cam-
paign surpassed all records. Towards the
close of things, as between Labor and
Nationalism, it got down to a question of
whether Bribery or Bigotry would capture
the silent vote. Honorable non-combatants
in this war of mud, the Progressives ap-
pealed to the electors on the ground that 46
of their 48 candidates were born in Australia
and 14 of them fought for it. A party
which takes its stand on its Australianism,
abandoning religious hatred to the “Liberal”
bigot and corruption to the Tammany crook,
is a party Avitli a future.
When something resembling the crack of
Doom became visible in the wall of the
future, McGirr, N.S.W. Minister for Babes
and Sucklings, declared that his obtuse col-
leagues had muddled things. There should
have been delay, and more time for “proper
enrolment of the nomadic workers and
others .” Still, there were 131,753 more
names on the old and supplementary rolls
than there were at the election two years
earlier, and a fair average increase of popu-
lation in that time, including infants, is
only about 100,000. So “nomadic worke”s
and others,” especially “others,” appear to
have done well enough, even though there
might not have been time to enrol all the
Lost Ten Tribes. Besides, the Tribes are
on the Queensland roll already.
The Queensland Government has borrowed
two millions from Uncle Sam, and is On the
verge of borrowing four millions more. As
the millions will undoubtedly be sunk in
alleged “public works” which not only re-
turn no interest but cost a great deal to
maintain, and as the bill for this will have
to be paid out of ruinous taxation, it would
be far cheaper as well as more honest if the
Theodore Go\ r ernment discarded the pretence
of spending the dollars for the public good
and divided the next £4.000.000 loan equally
among Queensland’s 750,000 inhabitants.
Then everybody would at least get his share
of the plunder, and nothing Avould be left
to pay for but the principal and the interest.
GroAving more mentally big-footed with
each passing hour, Dooley’s final campaign
utterances amounted to a hint' of civil war
in N.S.W. unless his party got back to the
Treasury and the contents thereof. His
way of putting it was that civil wars hap-
pened where his party wasn’t in charge, and
that Avhile it had the run of the Treasury
gore would be averted. The Federal Gov-
ernment ought to compile a list of the Rig
Noises who are always talking about that
revolution. Then they should be notified
by registered letter that unless they revolve
within six months and get it over they will
be disqualified and their soap-box burned,
and the very suggestion of revolution made
equal to six months certain. S’Africa has
got its little annoyance over and resumed
work, but here the thing hangs fire I’ke a
hollow tooth or a blackmailer or a threat-
ened A’isit from a man’s two mothers-in-law.
Job-control is a fine policy—so long as
it is your own job. When it is somebody
else’s "job and you’ve got money in it, then
it becomes quite clear that the other fel-
low’s a fool who isn’t to be trusted to con-
trol a inouse-trap. The unions have been
running the Hobart World for some time-
some of the plant, etc., bought for the Syd-
ney Labor daily-that-never-was-born was
used in it. Dwyer Gray has be°n its editor,
as he had been of its Labor predecessor, the
Daily Post, in which, incidentally, he lost
practically all his life’s savings. But Dwye*-
Gray naturally did things of which some of
the Labor bosses disapproved—they thought,
for instance, he Avas giving too much space
to the fund he Avas running for the relief of
the Broken Hill miners—and he was “re-
lieved” of his job. The directors —that is to
say, the representatives of the Labor capi-
talists—not only dictated the pol.cy of the
paper, but decided what news reports should
go in and what should be left out. None
of your job-control for them when their
money is at stake!
The Prime Minister has noAV another
remedy for job-control of the Commonwealth
ships. The line is to be “removed from
political control” —which some people
thought had happened already—and put
under a Board. Actually, the Board, having
neither army, navy, police nor law-making-
capacity, ought to be more easily knocked
out than the Government. Perhaps, how-
ever, the intention is that it shall pretend
that it is so much of a private institution
that it will not be singled out for spec'al
annoyance. Great things have been done by
brilliant make-believe. Charles 11., fleeing
from the defeat at Worcester, climbed a tele-
graph pole and pretended to be a line-repairer,
and another hard-pressed hero is said to have
averted suspicion by hiding behind a hedge
and making a noise like a carrot. But the real
question had better be faced —whether com-
bination to destroy or depreciate the nation’s
property in Tom Walsh’s way isn’t just as
much conspiracy as combination to destroy
it by fire or any other way.
Trying to wriggle out of the responsi-
bility for closing the greater part of the iron
and steel industry in N. S. Wales, Dooley
and his colleagues said that all would have
been well if the Commonwealth Nationalist
Government had stopped the dumping of
foreign iron and steel. Apparently Dooley,
like many others, thinks it doesn’t matter
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS IX X. S. WALES.
how much iron and steel cost Australia so
long as it is Australian iron and steel. These
people forget one thing—that, largely owing
to the enormous increase in the debt of
Australia, we simply must export to pay the
interest bill; and what we export we have
to sell in the open markets of the world.
Hence, if the Australian miner, farmer or
grazier can’t get his machinery and other
supplies as cheap as his foreign competitor,
he must suffer. He can’t put up his prices
because his production costs are higher.
And that is why hundreds of mines in Aus-
tralia are closed doAvn; also it is why
thousands of farms in Australia are aban-
doned.
A “union meeting” of the strictly ortho-
dox modern brand was held at Mt. Morgan
on the resumption of work. A resolution
was passed (unanimously, of course) that
“we workers of Mt. Morgan on record
our appreciation of the splendid work done
by Comrades Riordan, Lamont, It. J. Car-
roll and J. Stopford and the Brisbane com-
bined unions’ committee during the 12 months
we were locked out fighting the cause of our
class against the onslaught, of our employers
to bnng about a reduction of wages.
Motions of this rigged-up kind are always
carried “enthusiastically” or "by acclama-
tion,” nobody daring to vote the other Avay.
It would have been much more honest if the
motion had run that the workers of Mt.
Morgan thanked the gentlemen named for
habituating them to eating the bread of
charity for 12 months. And it would have
been much more interesting if it had set
out the salary and perks somte of these com-
rades had drawn during the “onslaught.”
It is a sign of the times tlint the Howard-
Smith Co., which deals in coal-mines and
ships and many things, is handing, back
£600,000 of capital to its shareholders, who
will doubtless put most of it into Govern-
ment securities. Owning public securities,
like McGirr’s business of collecting rents,
doesn’t furnish employment, 'but the docu-
ments are quiet and comfortable to sit upon.
State socialism gets another ud.: —
Another Commonwealth Minister passed by Canun-
gra (Q.) the other day and found it desolate.
Canungra used to live on its sawmill, but for
12 months it has lived on bitter memories and Gov-
ernment rations. In 1920 the Federal Government
acquired the local mill, plant and, forest for the
AVar Service Homes Department. The outfit was
worked for a few months by arrangement with the
sellers, but a departmental revolution occurring at
Melbourne, the mill was stopped, and all hands paid
off. The same thing happened at a sawmill on
Cedar Creek, also bought by the Government. Hav-
ing performed which acts of destruction, the Gov-
ernment started getting timber for the Digger’s
home from the Yarramun mill. It is 12 months
since Canungra heard the song of the saw, and
the Melbourne work-stoppers refuse to either resume
operations themselves or sell out to those who will.
The net results of their interference in the timber
industry are a large parcel of loan money locked
up ard earning nothing, a fine mill and a big supply
of cut timber in process of deterioration, an indus-
trious community impoverished, a township ruined.
But this is only one of many cases in which State
socialism, that was to be such a blessing to Aus-
tralia, has turned out a curse.
The Public Questions Committee of Mel-
bourne Uni. recently ascertained, through
one of its sub-committees, that seven-tenths
of the leaders of militant unionism are im-
portations. What is more, most of these
did not come to Australia until they were
well on in the thirties or forties. In effect,
the Australian working man has been per-
mitting foreigners to seize the control of
unions that he painfully built up and to in-
volve wsn in a heap of trouble. For the natural
tendency of the native-born industrial 1 'ad-
is to settle disputes by arbitration, whereas
that of the imported butter-in is to widen
the areii of the disturbance, because in most
cases lip has no constructive policy. Is there
any oilier country iu the world where the
outlai-«ier is permitted to assume such peril-
ous pc>wers?
What go-slow, the 44- (or less-) hour week
and their sister-curses mean to Australia
may be judged by the fact that in 1917 coke
cost the' Sulphide Corporation’s smelting
works 31s. 6d., as against 535. now. Large
coal was 12s. as against 21s. 9d. now. But
there is a bigger difference still. The co.
bought coke at 31s. 6d. and coal at 12s.
It has left off buying them at 535. and 21s.
9d. The next people to howl will, therefore,
be the coal-miners. They ought to. And so
should the owners. One side has been just
as merciless to Australian industry as the
other.
The Prime Minister lias become quite
heated over the “parochialism” of the Vic-
torians who* hesitate about letting his Gov-
ernment tear up their railways and unify
the gauge. If Lawson wasn’t so polite he
Avould probably explain that his State
doesn’t wanjc to be left, with two gauges and
a torn-up system and a feeling as if a mad
plumber had gone bankrupt on the premises.
No doubt <a written guarantee would be
given. But, then, South Aus. got all sorts
of guarantees about its railway, and paid
for it with a land-grant of 200,000 acres per
mile. And now the politicians laugh at the
trusting fool of a State which believed in
the Commonwealth’s honor and paid in
advance. These chickens will come home to
roost.
In N. S. Wales the 25th was Saturday,
Election Day and Personation Day—three
days in one. Under the previous law the
personator had to leave a trace of himself
by signing the name of the voter whose
identity he stole, and the word “forgery”
didn’t sound pleaspnt. The truly Dooley
party abolished the signing proviso, so that
the bogus elector need leave no footprint—
only a vague memory of a shadow in a
brown suit who looked as if his name
might be Smith.
“Pollio”: We heard a lot about apathy
during the N. S. Wales elections. In nine
cases out of ten it isn’t apathy at all. In
1904 J. G. Jenkins, then Premier of South
Aus., was asked to explain the apathy shown
at the Federal elections of the previous
December. “Easiest thing in the world!”
he said. “Decent men won’t, vote for the
Labor party because of its programme; and
they won’t vote for us Liberals because of
our personnel.” As time went on, decent
men did learn to vote for the Tabor pro-
gramme, and for its personnel—when it
meant Watson and Batchelor and their like.
But they never have learnt to vote for the
Liberal personnel; and, if the central com-
mittees are allowed to control the choice of
candidates much longer, I doubt whether
they ever will.
Statistician Giblin, of the Speck, dissect-
ing Forest-Commissioner Irby’s proposal to
people his projected schools of forestry with
400 Q British boys of the Barnardo Homes
class, points to the fact that. Tasmania has
so far failed to provide sufficiently attrac-
tive employment to induce its own native-
born boys to stay ki the island. “While
the drift to the mainland States or to Maori-
land continues,” says Giblin, “the importa-
tion of lads from Europe looks like pouring
Avater into a reservoir that is already full
and running ewer.” But it isn’t because
there are . too many youths that there is
emigration: it is because there are too few
industries. If industries are established to
envave the boys who are imported, nothing is
surer than that subsidiary industries will
spring up to employ more of the home-groAvn.
“Solomon Malaprop”: I did my duty at
the N.S.W. elections, and voted for all my
party’s candidates except Copperstein—one
has to drarv the line somewhere. Still, the
posters made me tired. I learned in the
course of the proceedings that Smith “stands
for economy” and Brown “stands for a fair
deal to everybody” and Briggs “stands for
honest finance” and Boomer “stands for pro-
gress.” If ever I go into the game my post-
ers will tell the nude, rude truth: “Solo-
mon Malaprop Stands for Parliament.” I
will add that so long as the salary keeps
up Solomon can stand a lot of it.

Of bushland' silence in the dell.

Thin echoes of another sound;

PIONEER LEATHER BELTING
FOR DURABILITY.
No matter how severe the conditions are in any factory, Pioneer Belts will
always give the best results.
Twenty years ago Messrs. Barnes' Linseed Oil Mills of Alexandria, purchased
an 18in. Pioneer Leather Belt transmitting 1508.H.P. Driving pulley 9ft.,
driven pulley 6ft. Distance between pulley centres. 40ft. Length of belt, 104 ft.
to take a speed of 3000 ft. per minute.
To-day it is still giving excellent service, and, for the last three years has
been averaging 24 hours a day.
This is sufficient proof to show that Pioneer Belts are unbeatable.

Milk and frozen meat are two big lines in
this co.’s business; and while the cow-juice
trade was badly disorganised in the early
months of last year when Cocky decided
to defy the city price-fixers and withhold
supplies, the meat export trad; was abnorm-
ally dull owing to the glut in the English
market. So it is not surprising that profits
were not adequate to pay the 8 p.c. declared
on a capital increased from £182.514 to
£209,359 during the year. Whether allow-
ance was made for depreciation is not dis-
closed : in the previous term the directors ad-
mitted that no provision had been made for
the replacement of wasting assets. Still in
the good years something more than was
necessary may have been laid aside.
The 8 p.c. div., by the way, means no
more than that- to old shareholders, not-
withstanding the capitalisation of £73,384
of reserves some years ago. For these
transfers merely replaced to a penny the
capital considered to have been lost as a
result of 1902 drought troubles. During
the past two years £44,245 of new capital
has been got in and sunk in new branches
and the purchase of properties formerly
held on lease. Balance-sheet movements
since 1915 and during the past two years
are shown hereunder -

Not only have property purchases taken
all the fresh capital, but the liquid surplus
has also been cut into. Two years ago
there was a surplus of stock, cash, gilt-edged
investments and book debts over and above
liabilities of £62,574; at the latest balance
the surplus had been reduced to £35,666.
It was further reduced to £27.571 when the
final div. was paid. Being in a business
subject to violent fluctuations, the F. F. and
I. Co.’s merits as an investment cannot be
gauged by the performances of any partic-
ular year. Nor, owing to abnormal condi-
tions, can averaging of recent performances
prove a satisfactory guide. But. on the
whole, over many years the co. has given
good returns to shareholders and meantime
accumulated useful surplus profits. And no
investor can expect more from a co. distri-;
bating foodstuffs.

When Chas. Ludowici broke away from the
old J. C. Ludowici Co. he set up in business
as a leather-goods manufacturer on his own
account. In 1917 the venture expanded into
a public co. with a paid capital of £23,338.
A little over three years later capital had
grown to £66,250. Everything had gone
well, and 10 p.c. had been paid regularly,
though the margin of visible surplus profit
was narrow. At the close of 1920 the direc-
tors, actuated no doubt by a threatened com-
mandeering of profits in excess of a certain
div. rate by some Government or other, de-
cided to reconstruct. The old co. was sold
to a new one, in which holders received four
fully-paid £1 shares for every three in the
old concern. This necessitated finding
£22,083. Of this £0732 represented the
value placed upon goodwill in the form of
patent rights and trade-marks. As visible
reserves could not have exceeded £2OOO by
much, apparently the balance of £13,300 or
.so came from the writing-up of other assets,
though as some of the co.’s belongings had
been newly-acquired there could not have
been much scope for appreciation in value
in some directions. Of course, in previous
terms —and particularly in the period when
boom prices were ruling for hides and
leather-goods—Mangrovite may have been
doing better than the published accounts ad-
mitted and something over and above the
disclosed surplus profits may have been laid
aside. But wherever the bonus capital came
from, a feature of the table is that during
th(‘ period of slump the co. continued to do
well, and maintained divs. on the old 10 p.c.
basis. Now, for the past half-year the co.
shows a net profit, after providing £1582 for
taxation, of £0677, representing a 15 p.c.
p.a. return on the enlarged capital. They
were, however, apparently exceptional profits,
due to the slumped hide market providing
unusual opportunities of stocking up with
raw materials at low cost. A continuance
of such favorable buying conditions cannot
be expected. If they can, then a good part
of the pastoral industry will go broke.
Owing to reconstruction, a comparison of
balance-sheet figures going back beyond
.Tune, 1921. is not of much value, except to
show in a general way the expansion of the
business: — „ _

Profits nowadays are only a shadow of those
of pre-war terms. Eight years, ago, for in-
stance, after providing for depreciation,
£5320 net remained for shareholders: for
the past half only £2721. And it is a
much bigger business which is producing the
smaller profit:—

1921 :. 21,979 2505 20,163
That comparison is not altogether satisfac-
tory, because both sides of the revenue
account have been expanded by heavier ex-
cise duties. Still, both the brewing and hotel
interests have grown very much during the
life of the table: the management never lost
faith in the future of beer even when the
prohibitionists were making their loudest
noise. Shareholders were even prevailed
upon to forego divs. for several terms so
that the co. could add Fremantle’s Commer-
cial Hotel to its string. A few years pre
viously £lO,OOO of new capital had also been
got in. This new capital and the £23.000
extra reserves at work make latest profits
look very skinny bv comparison with those
of 1913.'
Since 1915 the co.’s liquid position had
moved in this way:—
1915: 1920. 1921.

Liabilities . . . . 14,024 32,892 27,220

Excess liabilities .. £3,730 £62
Outside liabilities' consist wholly of hank
overdraft and current trade debts, and are
practically covered by stocks, book debts and
stindrv other assets, more or less liquid. The
brewerv and equipment, hotel proportion,
goodwill, etc., haven book value of £156,350.
but on the other side is a. depreciation re-
serve of £29.950. If that reserve is a fair
setjoff against the wastage of assets, the co.
shows £120.400 of assets (including good-
will) to represent the £70,000 of paid capi-
tal. Even allowing an excessive amount for
goodwill, shareholders’ funds actually in-
vested in tangible assets appear to be earn-
ing less than 5 p.c. There is something not
quite right if the co. really isn’t doing better
than that.

Since 1918 this co. has changed out of all
recognition. Formerly it had £1462 of live
capital and £1827 which had been forfeited
a dozen years or so before. Its chief aim
in life, it used to declare, was to maintain
prices for producers, and at the same time
supply retail vendors at minimum cost. Divs.
of 10 p.c. were paid regularly, but meantime
reserves very large in relation to capital
accumulated. Most of the stored profits
went into additions to works, making the co.
the most successful milk distributor in the
Commonwealth. By 1018 £49,465 of re-
serves had accumulated, but there was doubt
then as to whether some of the pile should
not be treated as a set-off against wastage
of assets. Though at one time semi-co-
operative, the Farmers and Dairymen’s, like
some of the mutual fire insurance cos.,
appears to have developed into a straight-
out proprietary. In 1018 there was a recon-
struction in which a lot of reserves were
converted into scrip, the holder of every one
£lO share getting 200 fully-paid £1 .shales.
In the following year there was another
shuffle, £28,607 of reserves being transferred
to capital; but apparently on that occasion
the distribution came from internal reserves.
One way and another, it is impossible to link
up recent balance-sheet movements satisfac-
torily. All that is clear is that the re-
shuffling suddenly took div. distributions from
£146 to £3493 p.a., though shareholders had
apparently not put a penny more into the
business.
Tfie reconstruction gave the co. a widened
field : besides dealing in milk, it was decided
to undertake refrigeration and cold-storage of
all foodstuffs, and the management was given
authority to dabble in export. To cope witli
new business additional stores were erected
and new plant installed, and this ontlav
necessitated new capital. East year 15,000
£1 shares were offered at par to holders:
and at December 31 last most of these shares
were paid to 4s. 6d. each. Balance-sheet
comparisons going back beyond the 1920
accounts are not of much value owing to
the writing-up of assets which evidently
gave the bonus issue just before. This
shows bow figures have moved during the
past 12 months: —

Last year was not a favorable one for the
co.: like other distributors, its milk busi-
ness was seriously affected by the eow-
cockies’ argument with the Profiteering
Court, and the export trade was inactive.

This society, now in its 52nd year, was
until recently afflicted with a cumbersome
sign-board: Industrial and Provident Per-
manent Benefit Building and Investment
Society. When the name was abbreviated
the constitution was also revised, and the
management used portion of the reserves as
bait to catch additional capital. Paid capi-
tal had been £43,030, and in 1920 1076 new
£2O shares were offered, £5377 being taken
from reserves to make the issue paid to £5,
per share to begin with. All calls have
since been got in. and paid capital is now
£64.540. About the same time the co, de-
cided to sell its old York-street freehold pre-
mises, which had stood in the books at
£7500; and the sale gave the co. £BOOO more
than that. Practically all the new capital
raised since 1919 and the cash received from
the sale of office premises has gone into
advances. Although not quite so much is
on loan to the co. as there was two years
ago, advances have practically doubled in
eight years. This shows how balance-sheet
figures have moved :

The society nowadays has £28.500 of re-
serves to assist £04,540 of paid capital, and
that support facilitates the payment of 8
p.c. divs. Besides extending its business, the
society has considerably improved the secu-
rity for its depositors and other creditors.
At the close of 1919 the management had
the care of £165 for every £lOO of combined
capital and reserves; at the latest balance,
slightly more than £lO2. So there are
assets, nearly all mortgages, with a book
value of nearly £2 to protect every £ bor-
rowed.

An interim div. at the rate of 10 p.c. p.a.
was paid, and though the year’s profits, after
having provided for repairs and renewals
and for taxation, look as though a final div.
at the same rate was earned, the latest dis-
tribution was on a 6 p.c. basis. The direc-
tors explain that the reduction is deemed
advisable “in view of the unsettled state of
commercial affairs generally.” At December
31 £5948 was owing to the bank and to
sundry creditors; on the other side only
£4Ol of cash was in hand, though stocks anil
book debts were smaller than in the previous
year. The difference between the div. rates
means £7OO, and that is a consideration
when bankers are not so ready with
advances, especially for div.-paying, as they
used to be. During the year additions were
made to buildings and equipment, and only
£3370 of the year’s profit of £4170 remained
in soluble form. At the latest balance stock,
cash, book debts and prepaid accounts
totted up £6474, so. disregarding the £20,000
of debentures, there was a liquid surplus
of only £526. Of course, when the time
arrived for the div. distribution, the cash
position had been assisted by two months’
trading during the most favorable portion
of the co.’s financial year. Balance-sheet
comparisons since the Hotel Pacific was
completed are shown hereunder, liabilities

Though since 1912 shareholders have had
only £11,550 divs. on their paid capital of
£35,000, or not quite 3f p.c. p.a., less than
£6500 of debt has been unloaded, and there
is still £65 of outside money for every £lOO
of share capital and reserves. The co. is
not the good thing its promoters thought it
would be; increased working costs, cur-
tailed liquor-trading hours and heavier rates
and taxes have knocked prospectus anticipa-
tions endways. An annual profit of £7400.
after allowing £2OOO for depreciation and
for renewals, had been expected, Still, share-
holders are favored by the fact that the site
was acquired before the land boom set in,
and construction was completed in the days
of comparatively cheap building.

Gottlbtjrn Gas Co., Ltd. —This little
southern N. S. Wales gas co. has maintained
an uninterrupted 8 p.c. on a £lO,OOO paid
capital for many years, but as it has £7600-
odd of reserves to assist the earnings are not
large. Works and other fixed assets repre-
sent £12,100 of funds, and at December 31
there was no less than £5731 in Government
securities, deposits and cash. Liabilities
amounted to only £617, and, including stocks
and book debts with cash assets, there was a
liquid surplus of £7433. There are very few
country gas cos. in such a cosy position. For
its latest half-year it dropped £llO into
reserves after finding the . usual £4OO for
.shareholders.


Do you use soldering irons in your business? No

possesses these and many other advantages over the
old style. It costs but little for current, and re-
quires very little attention to be kept clean and
well tinned. An exclusive feature of this iron is
the spiral coil wire handle, which keeps remarkably

Copper being low and wages and mine sup-
plies high, Wallaroo and Moonta (S.A.)
stand idle. They kept 1081 men going dur-
ing the December half-year, but lost money
with copper at £<3B a ton. It is doubtful if
they would have paid even if the price had
held to the previous year’s average of £BO.
Manager Hancock is filling in time working
out a plan for using brown coal for mine
and furnace work. In U.S.A. lately he saw
what was being done there with pulverised
lignites, and so got his directors to take a
hand in opening up the Clinton seams close
to Wallaroo. If his ideas pan out, another
customer will be lost to N. S. Wales. Han-
cock is also to see if the Australian Mineral
Recovery’s hydro-metallurgical process is
worth the ink that describes it. He is a
busy man, though the smelters aren’t

The Mount Lyell mine is now being placed
in a condition suitable for closing, and the
bottom levels are being stripped prior to
allowing the mine to flood. Ore production
is to be concentrated at the North Lyell
mine, the ore from which will be smelted by
itself. Extensions are being carried out in
the sorting, crushing, concentrating and flo-
tation plants to bring their capacitv up to
11,000 tons per month. When this is com-
pleted one remodelled furnace will cope with
the whole of the output, which in the other
departments will be converted into a high-
grade furnace feed caoable of maintaining
the blister copper output at about 550-600
tons per month. The alteration cuts 300
men off the pay-sheet, and many years off
the life of the mine. Nevertheless it is pre-
ferable to a complete closing down, and
eventually on a more equitable market the
new plan of working will produce a higher
percentage of profit.. It can safely, be said
the famous Blow workings are being defi-
nitelv abandoned as a copper proposition, the
pyrites being available now for sulphuric
acid and superphosphate manufacture only.

During the next few weeks 'a number of
expeditions will leave Perth for the North-
West in search of oil. The more important
are the Freney and Okes-Durack parties.
Now that real operations are about to com-
mence it is as well for shareholders and
people who may be invited to become share-
holders to come to earth and consider how
much has been actually accomplished. Last
year Assistant State-Geologist Blatchford re-
commended a detailed geological survey, to
be followed by systematic testing. Blatch-
ford also reported having found traces of
mineral oil. So much was made of his re-
commendations that the Freney and Okes-
Durack cos. were floated, both providing
juicy cuts in cash and paid-up shares to
vendors and promoters. Fat fees were voted
to directors and officials of Freney's; £5OO
p.a. for a secretary and £lOO to £l5O p.a.
for directors in cos. which, so far as they
know at present, possess nothing more than
traces of mineral oil. The existence of
pools anywhere in the areas is still un-
proved ; all that has been discovered so fai-
ls just enough to warrant search. And in
the absence of a thorough geological survey
the search is going to be severely handi-
capped. Nothing, indeed, is sure about it
except that it will cost a lot of money.
Sydney is being invited to become inter-
ested in 1000 sq. miles of supposed oil-lands
held by the Freney Co. around Kimberley
(W.A.). The proposition is introduced by
Freney’s Geike Range Oil Development Co.,
in 300;000 shares of 10s.: 200,000 are to
be issued at once, half of them being offered
for subscription by the public (ss. down and
the other ss. callable in two months), and
the vendor co. is to take £5OOO of the cash
subscribed and also 100,000 fully-paids.. The
demand for a consideration of these dimen-
sions by a co. which has nothing more than
“indications” and is only just about to com-
mence its geological survey campaign is the
limit of impudence. Until the vendor con-
cern has something more to show than en-
couraging, but cautiously worded, reports by
Professor David, geologist Blatchford and
others, a float like this is not worthy of
serious consideration other than as a medium
for share-gambling.

Since his return from the Territory Dr.
Basedow is not flying kites for oil spoofs.
With a wave of his pen he sweeps out a
lot of the pegged-out areas as no good be-
cause they are not within the permo-car-
boniferous horizon. Nor does he anoint
Kimberley just because bitumen has been
got there’ It “is a; good indication, but does
not necessarily point to liquid oil below.”
His suggestion that lava spread over the
country may have resolved the original oil
into bitumen is a possibility that sticks.
Yet that won’t stop the flotation of cos. or
the catching of gudgeons if once a bit of
good news floats along a wire to Perth,
Adelaide and Sydney.

Two victims of the Hampton boom —
Britannia and White Hope West—have
taken options on thousands of square miles
of alleged oil-hearing country in the Northern
Territory. The former expects “to com-
plete the purchase in the near future on
very favorable terms,” and the latter has
arranged with the Border Petroleum Co. to
share the cost of a prospecting expedition.
What looks like a new opal-field has turned
up in the Biackall Range district, about 50
imles north of Brisbane. Very little pros-
pecting has been done so far, but some very
decent specimens have been unearthed. The
gems are associated with weathered blue-
metal (basalt) and silica clays, and pieces of
opal shed from this matrix have been picked
from the soil underlying. The occurrence
is similar to that at Tintinbur (N.S.W.),
where some good finds were made last year.
Like much of that opal, the new stuff is on
the light side as to color, but pieces cut by a
Brisbane firm are up to gem standard.

Prospects have much improved the last
fortmgnt with the Billy Hugnes, Normanby
(Q.). The 50ft. level along the Frederick
lode has been opened up for 40ft., and for
that distance discloses a reef sft. thick, aver-
aging ISdwt. per ton. The trouble so far on
this new field has been the smallness of the
reefs, so this development is encouraging to
Meredith’s Syndicate, which has bogged in
against real pioneering difficulties. A sft.
reef will keep the co.’s battery going full time,
and, although the ore is under an ounce, it
can be sweetened up with pickings from the
smaller and richer reefs.
* * * *
In the bore now going down near the new
Government shaft on the Styx coalfield (Q.)
the log shows 154 ft. of coal in four different
seams to a depth of 280 ft., and three of
them appear to be of workable thickness and
quality. The bottom seam, struck at 276 ft.,
is 44ft. through, and of very fine quality.
Every bore so far has struck a good run of
seams, but the geologist in charge has not
been able to corellate most of them, which
indicates sudden changes in stratigraphical
sequence, as well as alteration of the coal
seams. While the coal is tiptop, operations
have been disappointing to a certain extent
owing to the difficulty of finding an undis-
turbed area. Hence the new bore and shaft.
It is not certain yet whether a settled area
of coal of any extent has now been located.
J. W. Brophv, Superintendent of State
Mines, is on the field installing machinery
and plant, and it is intended to put on extra
men and increase the output considerably in
a month or two.

Work has been kept going at the Mt. Cl ear-
view gold mine, in the Cape River district
(N.Q.). The lode 60ft. twlow the tunnel-
level carries a reef 3ft. thick, assaying from
lOdwt. to loz. As it has now been tested
to a depth of 150 ft. there looks to be a
fair-sized body of medium ore, and it is
expected a battery w’ll be shifted on to it
to give it a-run. Most of the ore is free
miffing, but the bottom shows splashes of
sulphide.

When North Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.), was
a sick dog no one'wanted to nurse it. Now
that Hansen has it in trim, ownership is
coveted, for the market dearly loves a flutter
when Daylesford affords the chance. Han-
sen’s luck came when he crosscut west at
No. 6 level: out 200 ft. he ran into a new
reef which, having the merit of being in
shallow ground, has more than a sporting
chance of carrying gold. To the north no-
thing much shows, hut south a 3ft. forma-
tion is making. Meantime, on the middle
reef he has run ouc of the: faulted zone, and
has a 6ft. to 7ft. lode of payable stone. The
best quartz now being broken from McMil-
lan’s is at No. 8,80 ft. of pay-dirt having
been opened up. South there is plenty of
stone, but no gold. On the formation the
footwall veins are. sufficiently extensive to
supply the battery for months to come.
Whether the grade will improve is what isn’t
established, but the reef is worth hanging
on to. Hansen will prospect No. 5 level
for the run of dirt at Nos. 6 and 7 levels, and
will push ahead north at No. 7 to see if
the shoot in McMillan’s lives there. Along-
side him the Ajax has stepped out of its
shroud because of a new run of gold. North
Ajax has a possibility of getting its exten-
sion at No. 4. There is nothing of the
bonanza about Hansen’s mine, but he has
been bred on a low-grade diet, and so can
wring divs. out of 6dwt. dirt even with the
gold premium shrinking. Costs run out at
245. per ton, including ss. 6d. for develop-
ment. This should satisfy everyone except
men who hanker after the other chap’s shirt.
So far Ajax North on a paid capital of
£23.838 has given back £21,000 in divs. Gold
won is valued at £129,381. Of that £82,369
is the wage bill, and £40,000 has gone for
fuel and material.

F. Grey Wilson, of Tingha Tin. lost no
time in getting to work to test the deep-
lead at Elsmore Valley (N.S.W.). The pros-
pectus of the £3OOO syndicate was issued
early in February; on March 23 the first
bore was commenced.
* * * *
Carpathia Tin (N.S.W.) meeting last
week passed off without the usual rows. It
wasn’t because there were no reasons for
caustic criticism. The only work recorded
was the treatment of tailings at a heavy
loss, which is to be covered by a call. The
co. owes the bank £B4OO, but has a fixed
deposit of £B5OO. It was a stroke of adroit-
ness on the part of the chairman to divert
attention from the weaknesses disclosed in
reports and balance-sheet by making a furi-
ous attack on the workers. But it was a
peculiar sort of diplomacy to apply to men
wno are to be askec. to take less wages.
Mount Bisehoff during 1921 operated in
only a small way and made a profit of £lOO
on a turnover of 28,000 tons crude ore.
Chiefly responsible for the operations,
limited though they were, was the success-
ful working of the new low-grade roaster,
by which 2500 tons of 21 p.c. concentrates
were treated for 83 tons oxide, averaging
65 per cent. tin. The cost of recovery was
only £24 per ton oxide. Without the new
roaster the mine would have passed to the
caretaker stage early in 1921, as present-day
operating costs and ore-grade do not allow
tin to be mined and milled profitably at
under £lBO per ton. From the 25,000 tons
ore treated 274 tons oxide was produced,
but the average milling recovery was only
0.32 p.c., as illustrated below: —
Recovery per Ton
Tons Oxide. Crushed.
Milling plant . . 145 .32 p.c. tin.
Clean-up old plant . . 24 .06 p.c. ~
Roasting department .. 105 .25 p.c. „
Total .. 274 .63 p.c. tin.
As 90 p.c. of the ore reserve is highly pyritic
the necessity for extending the roasting
capacity is obvious, especially now it has
been demonstrated that such low-grade
pyritic concentrates (24 p.c. tin, 42 p.c. iron
and 48 p.c. sulphur) can be profitably dealt
with. Ore reserves now stand at 510,000
tons. The 260,000 tons of positive ore con-
tains only .35 p.c. tin, a low grade for mana-
ger Gudgeon to cope with in the face of high
wages and short hours. Unlike the majority
of the big tin shows Bisehoff took cover early
in 1921, when the slump became so pro-
nounced, and is thus able to balance its ledger
where so many others have failed.
The difficult task of turning the Ringa-
rooma River is now nearing completion at the
Briseis (Tas.), and should be finished in
June. Once the deviation is completed a fine
stretch of rich ground estimated to contain
three to four thousand tons of tin oxide will
be available. After testing many properties
in various parts for acquisition, it seems
likely the co. will take over the old Arba
ground, whose deep rich lead could no longer
be profitably extracted by the Arba’s steam-
driven plant.
The Hydro-Poweiv and Metallurgical Co.
(Tas.) appears to be doing much better since
the Government took a hand and appointed
nominees to the Board. Carbide is being
produced regularly at the rate of 100 tons
per week, and is finding a ready sale because
of its excellent quality. The trouble over
the manufacture of electrodes has been mas-
tered, and this department is to be re-
modelled for the manufacture of all classes
and sizes of electrodes, the demand for which
is assured and increasing in the Southern
Hemisphere. No forward movement has been
made by the co. to treat the Mount Read-
Rcsebery complex ores by the Gillies process.
Perhaps it is waiting for the great Electro-
lytic Zinc Co. to make good the various
promises to the original Read-Rosebery
shareholders, and convert this ore into cash,
and not merely tie it up.
A new co., Australian White Lead, Ltd.,
has been formed to take over the plant, con-
tracts and leases of the lead sulphate works
of Launceston. The new co. will have a
capital of £50,060 in £1 shares, 18,000 fully-
paid and £5300 cash to pass to the vendors.
It is proposed to re-start the old plant
immediately; once this has been brought to
its maximum capacity it will be duplicated
and manufacture gone in for in a big way.
The process used will be the Gitsham-Ever-
shed, which aims at a non-poisonous white-
lead production. Henry Jones is the power
behind the new co.

The Preolenna coalfield is at last to have
a railway connection to the State system,
and with the usual Tasmanian dash the
seven-mile link is to be completed early next
year—or the year after. The syndicate
(which carried out extensive prospect-
ing and development) has been con-
verted into a company. With the
completion of the railway exit equipment
is to be installed to output 100 tons of house-
hold and steam coal per day, and in addition
retorts are to be erected for a crude-oil
recovery from the shale which, abounds on
the area.

A co. in 80,000 shares has taken over the
Endurance mine from the old Prop., and will
continue to work the area for the drift tin.
Pioneer mine-manager Mark Ireland, who
put the show on its feet, has retired for a
well-earned rest.

The Corinna Gold Syndicate has been
fortaed in Melbourne to prospect the old
Corinna alluvial workings in the Speck. R.
lvreos, who recently investigated the area,
reckons the old hands who worked the leads
were on a false bottom, and that the differ-
enae between the then primitive method of
working and modern appliances gives the
show 7 a chance. Tasmanian experience, how-
ever, does not support this conclusion, as
many have found to their cost. In any case,
was the work done on the Corinna field so
primitive? R. Stringer, of Melbourne,
lathers the show.
* * * *
The Mount Victoria Struggle Gold-mine
(Tas.) continues to open up satisfactorily,
and a battery is now being erected, adjacent
to the low level, wherein amalgamation, con-
centrating and cyanidisation will take place.
This district is favorably commented on by
geologists, and may again place the Speck
in the list of gold-producers.

There is nothing modest in the Laihpeii
Tin Syndicate prospectus except the auiotmt
of the capital, Tw r elve shares of £250 each
are to be issued to furnish £3OOO. This will
be remitted to secure the property, which
is to be nursed till the tin-market clouds
roll by Then tlie originals are to set all
that £3OOO back in cash, besides 12,000 £1
paids, in a co. of £lOO,OOO. The show 7 is
backed by W. F. McKenzie (Rae and Mc-
Kenzie), F. Wickett (late g.-m. of the
Tronah), W. L. Smith and W. Bethune.
All of them know tin-mining in Malaya,
and, their approval being hard to get, the

“IN THE NAME OP ANZAC!”
The khaki that once brought glory to Australia is now used chiefly to bring small coins to the bands of musicians who pervade the street of Australian
cities, and those of Sydney in particular. Most of the collectors are limbless men, and the rattle of their boxes is not more an appeal to the charity of the
passer-by than a reproach to Australia, If the pensions paid to them are insufficient, they must be increased, and an end put to the use of the uniform for
purposes of thinly-veiled mendicancy.

Vic. Premier Lawson has just concluded
the fourth year of his Premiership; but he
has still a long way to go to beat the late
George Turner’s record of 1895 days (Sep-
tember 27, 1894, to December 5, 1899).
Lawson is also behind Bent, McCulloch and
Gillies, who held office for 1789, 1775 and
1722 days. If, however, lie can get through
the next session, he should not only pass
George Turner, but be runner-up to Hughes,
who is the long-distance champion of the
Commonwealth.
The oldest Costs in Sydney, now that
death has struck Henry Deane off the roll,
is Fred Gannon, uncle of the K.C. and
father of two lawyer sons. He was 87 the
other day, so was actually older than Deane;
but he was not admitted till 1864. Gannon
has another long-distance record : he settled
at Tempe when the place was marsh and
bush 56 years ago.
Poor old Andrew Fisher, whose proffered
candidature has been rejected by the Labor
crowd at Kilmarnock, in his native Ayr-
shire, made Kilmarnock suspicious of him
when, as Australian Priminister, he went
there the day after his first return to Bri-
tain. Keir Ilardie was of the party, and
characteristically reeled off some universal
brotherhood stuff about White Australia.
Andrew rebuked him. “My dear old com-
rade is a fine-hearted man,” he said, “hut
he would be a bigger force in our movement
if he would refrain from speaking about
things he doesn’t understand.” In days
when Andrew has lost his punch, Kilmar-
nock’s Reds wouldn’t be slow in raking that
up against him.
Robert Cruicksliank died suddenly in
Adelaide last week after being ill a long
time. He was a strong man in everj way.
As a lawyer he stuck to I'oit Adelaide,
where he was born, and had a big business
with shipping and seamen. He was an ori-
ginal member of the Municipal Tramways
Trust, and died in harness just after a
meeting. He was a member of the Public
Library and Art Gallery Board for years.
When he lived for a time on the opposite
side of the city, St. Peters made him its
mayor. In sport he was a mighty force,
chiefly in rowing, stroking various inter-
state arid local champion eights. Tie was
at various times chairman of the Football
Assoc, and the League of Wheelmen. When
he took up yachting he became vice-commo-
dore, and, taking a fancy to horse-racing
later with the Port Adelaide Club, he shortly
became its chairman. He was only 57 at
the end.

been awarded the valor badge of the Vic.

shots at him, had only been in blue for a
year. He persuaded his colleague O’Meara,

in the firing-line, as he was single and had no
one dependent on him. The fellow Bates was
after had nearly done for a boy with an axe,
and in his frenzy didn’t mind if he com-
pletely wiped out somebody else. He is
now ticketed as dangerous in an asylum.
Recently-buried F. T. Derham, Tory of
Tories though he was, always had a warm
corner in the hearts of Labor opponents in
Victoria. During the big strike in ’9O
he declined to close the Swallow and Ariell
works at Port Melbourne on the pretext of
shortage of coal. He declared he would
burn the fittings of the factories before_ he
would add to the misery caused by the strike.
General JOHN GELLIBRAND , who has
left off being Commissioner of Victorian
Police to go back to his Tasmanian
orchard.
Dead in Adelaide after years of illness,
Ernest Cowle, son of an old-time E.. S. and
A. Bank manager. He was to follow the
family business, but preferred an outdoor
life, and till laid aside by illness was a
mounted trooper in the Northern Terri-
tory, where lie gave valuable help to Bald-
win Spencer and Gillen and other explorers.
He had been out of action for 20 years, but
lived to 58.
Those N. S. Wales doctors who a year or
so ago insisted that Mrs. Farr, the wife of
the M.L. professor, was a victim of “circu-
lar” insanity, however much she might im-
press the Lunacy Reform League to the
contrary, were right. The poor woman,
herself recognising that there was something
wrong, sought medical help at Wellington
last month, and within a few days the five
medical officers of the Government unani-
mously certified that her time of mental
trouble had come round again. The “circle”
seems to be about 10 months.
Tom Morkham, who threw up his job as
Sec. of the Vic. Lands Department in 1003.
was close to the 78th post when he died
the other day. It was the ambition of hjs
young manhood to become Sec. of Public
Works, and when lie got his heart’s desire
he was induced to take the still higher job
of permanent head of the Lands. But no-
thing he did there was of such lasting good
as his work when head of the Local Gov-
ernment Branch of the Public Works. Muni-
cipal councils regarded him as a demigod.
He was their Privy Council, and lived up
to it.
“Skipper”: The winner of the Long-service
, Stakes (B. 9/3/’22) is Colonel Frank Makin,
of Adelaide, who was* wearing a Sam Browne
before Bennett, Courtney and the rest had
been weaned. He is 80, his first commission
is dated January, 1861, and his name still
appears on the Army List as Honorary
Colonel of the 10th Infantry (Adelaide
Rifles), the regiment which he commanded
in his younger days. Four of his sons saw
service in the late war, and it was to one
of them (Captain Makin. who died recently
in Ballarat) that De Wet surrendered in
the S’Afric.an misunderstanding.
Of the 15 Judges who have served «mee
Tasmania’s Supreme Court was born, 98
years ago, William Curran Smith nas
“cried” for 11. They put the Imperial Long-
service Medal on his chest a few days ago.
Died suddenly in Melbourne Austin Baker,
a well-known solicitor and one of Australia’s
authorities on company and mining law. He
was the eldest son of Richard Baker, once
member for the Wimmera in the Vic.
Assembly and Minister for Education under
Patterson.
Tate has strengthened his inside staff in
the Vic. Education Department by inducing
Service-Commissioner Morrison to nominate
Jim Mcßae, vice-principal of the training
college, to be assistant chief inspector vice
Gates. Chief-Inspector Fussell ' and Beth-
eras, the next man. are over 60, so there
should soon be still bigger work for Mcßae,
who is only 50 and very fit.
“Alex”: W. H. Ividston, who helped to
lay the foundation-stone of Queensland’s
Labor party and was afterwards Premier,
finds a resting-place in the cemetery at
Rockhampton. So far, no one has found
tinie to _ place a tombstone over the remains
of the little Scotch bookseller. His wife and
a daughter sleep next door.
The Mathers, who have sold drapery in
Hobart for a century, have sold out. Both
the business and premises in Liverpool-
street are now in the hands of W. J. Bailey,
one time of the S. M. Herald and after-
wards advertising manager for Farmer’s
(Sydney). The Mather firm has lived on
the present site 86 years, although the busi-
ness itself began in 1822.
Flags were half-mast at Newcastle and
Sydney on Saturday for Capt. John Hardie
Veitch, 62, assistant harbor-master at the
coaling port. An experienced shellback,
Veitch served his time in the old Loch
line in the ’seventies. Settling in Aus-
tralia lie joined the Howard Smith Co.
and later the Mcllwraitli-McEacharn line,
and held commands under both house-flags.
His shore jobs included that of surveyor
and inspector in the Navigation Department
and secretary to the Marine Board at New-
castle.
“T. 0.1” among the wool-bales: —
Two big Australian wool-firms have amalgamated—
Goldsbrough, Movt and Co. and Harrison, Jones and
Devlin. Richard Goldsbrough, the founder of the
first firm, reached Melbourne from Yorkshire in 1847,
and next year started a wool business in a small
way. Three years later he built a blue-stone store
off Market-street, and in 1853 took in as partners
Teddy Row and George Kirk (father of the late
Mrs. Walter Russell Half). The following year Hugh
Parker joined them and remained in the firm until
his death in 1878. In the early ’sixties Goldsbrough
built the big blue-stone warehouse opposite Mcnzies
Hotel. The Kirk-Waiter Russell Hall connection
explains how the firm got into touch with Mt.
Morgan, and so became mixed up with copper, with
which it had a lot to do, especially in the year’s
just before the war. Harrison, Jones and Devlin
dates from the middle ’sixties, when L. M. Harri-
son bought the stock and station agency business
conducted by Robert Forbes. A few months later
J. R. Jones joined, but soon sold his interests to
his brother, the late Richard Jones, M.L.C., and in
1870 Devlin came in. Twelve years later the con-
cern became a limited company. Prior to Golds-
brough coming to Sydney T. S. Mort had established
a wool business, which, after his death, amalgamated
with Goldsbrough and Co. The Joneses were sons
of Richard Jones, who, after working on the Moni-
tor for some years in the late ’thirties, established
(1842) the Maitland Mercury. Years later he was
chairman of the Commercial Bank of Sydney.
A copper tablet in St. Andrew’s states
that Archbishop
Saumarez Smith
was the only Met-
ropolitan of Syd-
ney who died and
was buried in his
diocese. Brough-
ton, Barker and
Barry all died
abroad. The re-
verse is the case
with N. S. Wales
Chief Justices.
Forbes, Dowling,
Stephen and Mar-
tin died here, but
Darley was on
final leave when he
went out in Lon-
don. He lies in
the family vault in
Dublin.

Brigade Chief.
Edward Best, brother of the M.11.1t. for
Ivooyong (Vic.), still reigns as a High
Court Associate, a job he took up years ago
when he had the higher ambition of being
called to the Bar. The one exam, he had
to pass to achieve his desire he eventually
became too indifferent to face, so he re-
mained where he was. First he served under
Griffith, then under Barton, and now he is
sitting in the shadow of Iliggins, J.
“Vandorian” from London: —
Australia Day (Jan. 26) was this year recognised
in a way hitherto unknown in this township. Find-
ing nobody else making a move, ex-Adelaide parson
A. G. B. West was responsible. Though British-
born, he is one of the best of Good Australians —he lived
in the sunshine for years and loves it and its people.
As rector of St. Dunstan’s-in-the-East he took amazing
trouble to find the address of every Australian in or
near the Thames, and forwarded an invitation to a
special service in his church. He located me in a
remote Surrey village. And then for many of us he
spoiled it all. Too modest to preach to a congre-
gation of his own inviting, he recklessly asked the
gloomy Dean Inge into his pulpit. Among other
things his reverence (who is very deaf) told his con-
gregation that Australia was too rich to be virtuous.
He would, you know.
LITTLE LADY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sitting sideways in the tram,
With a profile set to tease me,
Is a winsome lady slim.
Cythera, whose lures vve hymn,
May not this one also please me?
Would you have me coldly slam
On youth’s dreams the door of age,
And go creeping from the stage?
Sitting sideways, sweet and chic,
With her legs crossed very pertly,
There’s a show of ankles neat,
There’s a show of tempting feet.
One can’t watch such things inertly,
And she knows it. Every trick
Is deliberate, and her pose,
From her tresses to her toes
Is intended to bewitch :
Every ruffle, every stitch
Of the dainty frock revealing
Is a luscious bait concealing
(Ah!) the cruel hook beneath
That may stab our souls to death.
This one won’t do things by halves,
And the silk that hides her calves
Doesn’t really hide a particle
Of each pleading rounded article.
So I know that sitting there
She is Satan, and I swear
She shall tempt me not, nor wean
My true heart (see what I mean?)
From dear thoughts of ’seventeen
And a damsel tripping lightly,
Very roguish, very sprightly,
Whom I kissed in ’seventeen- —
A damsel much-demanding
Who on my poor heart was standing
When the sky above was azure and the grass below
was green
’Mid the rapture and the torture of that day in
’seventeen!
Sit you, therefore, in the tram,
With your long legs aimed to kill us,
Little lady, do your worst!
As for me, I saw you first.
To the charms with which you’d thrill us
I am ice and adamant.
Fauns may chuckle deep and pant
After nymphs that sidle by,
Gnomes may whisper naughty comments, very subtle,
very sly,
But for me, though you may sit
With your legs crossed, not a whit
Faster beats my heart, or swerves'
Under pressure of your curves
This my soul from its long worship (on, you must
know what I mean 1)
Of the damsel caught in passing whom I kissed in
’seventeen,
Of the damsel young and tender who sobbed low in
’seventeen,
When my youth died and my heart broke at the end
ot ’seventeen.
Good-bye, lady; good-bye, lady,
With the pupils soft and shady
’Neath the lashes long and sweeping!
All no use. My dreams are sleeping
That last sleep ! I watch you kindly,
Dryly, maybe, but not blindly ;
Yet you leave me cold as ashes (do you yet know
what I mean?) —•
You’re disarmed, oh, most completely, by that girl
in ’seventeen!
By the girl I kissed at parting when I died in
’sevehteen!

“Bio-Ohem”: Re “M.D.” (B. 9/3/’22) on'
Russian (alius Bulgarian) “culture.” This
stuff is associated with an interesting little
chapter in medicine. Metchnikoff, a Russian
scientist, who ranks with Pasteur, Lister*
and Koch among the great men of medicine,,
reasoned that the putrefactive bacteria in
the large intestine produce toxins which are,
absorbed into the circulation, and that to
these toxins are due many of the evils to
NOBLESSE OBLIGE.
“Jack was more than half-an-hour trying
to persuade me to name th& day.”
“Did you give way, dear?”
“Yes. I was afraid the chair would if I
didn't”
which mankind is heir. He found that the
bacteria could not live in the presence of
acid produced by the lactic acid bacilli
(“Russian culture”), whicih are themselves
harmless to man, and he s.Tid: “If it be true
that our unhappy and precarious old age is
due to poisoning of the tissues (the greater
part of tlie poison coming from the large
intestine, inhabited by numberless microbes),
it is clear that agents which arrest intes-
tinal putrefaction must at the same time
postpone and ameliorate old ;age.” So great
was his prestige that the culture was taken
up by the profession, and between. 1908 and
1910 there raged one of the most violent con-
troversies medicine has ever known. But
gradually it was proved that the putrefac-
tive bacteria in the intestine were, harmless
and indeed necessary for a very important
part of the digestive process, namely excre-
tion, and so the treatment gradually tell
into disuse.
* * * *
“Exul”: A medico needs to be pretty ex-
plicit in his directions. A patient of mine had
tonsilitis last
month, and I
ordered that his
throat be swabbed
with a hydrogen
peroxide lotion,
describing accu-
rately, as I
thought, the way
I wanted it done.
A couple of days
later, since h e
wasn’t improving
as I expected, I
got them to swab
it in my presence.
All was correct
except that they
swabbed the out-
side of his neck
instead of his ton-
sils. When I men
tiohed the incident
to a fellow G.P..
he told me he had
once supplied a
patient with an
ointment, and a
couple of days later
the man returned
and asked for
some more as that
lot was all used
up. Questioned as
to how he had got
through it so
quickly, he replied
that as there were
no directions as to
the quantity to be
taken he had eaten
a teaspoonful
three times a day.
It was very nasty but
had relieved his pain wonderfully. It should
—it was gall and opium.

“Gregor’s” memory of a nightmare:— :
The sentencing of a New Guinea patrol-officer to
12 months for putting a mortally-wounded nigger
out of his misery with a revolver bullet recalls an
incident that happened near the mouth of the Mark-
ham :in 1917. With a patrol-officer, of about 20
years’ experience in the country I was coming down
from the rar.ge, when we halted at a village about
15 miles from the coast. Notic-
ing a low, dilapidated-looking hut
a short distance from the village,
we asked the Luluai what was in
it. He said the occupant was
very sick, unable to help himself,
and had been so for a long time.
As ours was a medical patrol we
decided' to have a look at him.
My companion crawled in through
the narrow opening- in the hut,
but almost immediately crawled
out again and was violently sick.
I made my way in on hands and
knees and struck a match. Then
I, too, was sick. Huddled up in
one corner was an old man wasted
away until his legs and arms
were skin and bones. His viscera
could be easily distinguished even
in that light, including the con-
volutions of his bowels. Here and
there on his body were large run-
ning sores, and his head was a
very epitome of horror—a great
suppurating ulcer. Two revolver
bullets put the poor brute out of
his misery, and when we got back
to headquarters we reported to
Administrator Pethebridge what
we had done, J accepting the
responsibility, as it was I who
had been the executioner. Pethe-
bridge, being 'a man of common-
sense, listened to our reports,
then closed the matter with the
remark that it was the best thing
we could have done. Had it been during the pre-
sent regime I suppose we would have got five years
each.

“Cartot”: A postcard I got from Copen-
hagen the other day brought memories of
a queerly-assorted pair I used to know be-
fore they set out to see the world together.
One was an American, generally known as
“Doc,” unmarried, about 40, and a good
sport. He had a number of degrees, rang-
ing from qualifications in medicine to hon-
orary distinctions conferred upon him by
a leading English ’Varsity for research work
in anthropology and ethnology. About five
years ago he turned up in ex-German New
Guinea, whence he set out with the inten-
tion of making the Dutch possessions, via
Geelvink Bay, then striking inland and ex-
ploring the country at the back of the bay.
When he had got just about as far from
civilisation as it was possible for him to
get he fell a victim to malignant malaria,
and his ‘‘boys” cleared out with as much
of his property as they could carry and left
him to shift for himself. While he was in
this plight an Australian known as Bill, a
wandering paradise-bird hunter, arrived at
a village fiO miles away, and there he heard
vague stories of a. sick white man aban-
TIME SHE WAS WELL.

doned in the bush. He promptly set out, and
by forced marches, day and night, managed
to find “Doc” in a little over four days.
The Yank was almost dead, but the rescuer
pulled him around sufficiently for him to
make a start for the coast. However,
“Doc.’s” boots were so worn as to be use-
less, and in a few hours his feet w T ere prac-
tically raw meat. Without hesitation, Bill
took the sufferer on his back and carried
him to Eitape, the best part of 150 miles
away. He made the journey by short stages,
being compelled to often rest, and, fortu-
nately, his burden weighed only about eight
and a half stone. When they got to Eitape
both were “all in,” and each spent the next
six weeks in bed. Then “Doc” revealed the
fact that he was a moneyed person, and
insisted on Bill making an extended tour
of the world with him ; and they have been

pottering about the four corners of the globe

got from him, remarked that he prefers it
to paradise-bird hunting in Dutch New
Guinea.

“Will Lawson”: Two ghosts that have
haunted Cook Strait (M.L.) for years have
been driven off at last. They are the little
Nikau and Kaitoa, which until recently ran
a passenger mail and cargo service between
Wellington and Nelson. No weather ever
stopped them. Every night, at about the
hour when graveyards yawn, they passed each
other near the spot where the City of Dun-
edin is supposed to have foundered with all
hands in ’O5. But their owners have bought
a larger steamer to cope with the trade, and
big coasters can’t be ghosts. They can’t
slip in behind islands or glide out of dim
water-passes or appear suddenly right under
the bows of timid ocean tramps. They can’t
hug the shore so close either, which, along
with their seaworthiness and power, is the
secret of why the twin ghosts so often defied
gales that held bigger boats in port.

Oh, Boy! Try our Boston Pork and Beans!
Tiie Waldorf-Astoria has nothing- on us. Take a sup
of our Ole Virginity Coffee.
I read, sighed for the tongue that Shaks-
peare spoke and passed on. A few days
later I looked through the doorway. No one
was consuming the Home Eats; in fact,
the place was empty. A fortnight passed.
Came a public holiday and the closing of
my usual luncheon-dive. The thought of
the Ole Virginny Coffee became alluring;
I sat down and asked for a cup. “No
coffee,” said a dejected girl, “only tea.”
“Well, tea and Boston pork and beans.”
“They’re off.” “Pumpkin pie, then.” "It’s
off, too.” “Could I have a home eat?” In
a burst of candor she said: “We got none.
We got nothing but scones.” Yesterday I
passed the place again. In the window, where
formerly many placards had hung, there
appeared now but one: —
Sale of Bankrupt Stock.
Complete Equipment of Up-to-date Restaurant.
No Reasonable Offer Refused.
Under ordinary circumstances the death of
an industry causes me gloom. Yesterday,
somehow, 1 found myself leaving the scene
of tbe ruin with a light step.

“W. Blister”: Another nomination for the
Endurance Stakes. Recently Paddy White, a
lad employed on Nappa Merri station
(S.-W.Q.), was thrown from his horse and
had his shoulder dislocated and the sinews
badly torn. The shoulder was replaced and
bandaged by his mates, and as there was no
other means of travelling he saddled his
horse and set out alone for Tibooburra hos-
pital, 200 miles away. Nearly half the dis-
tance had to be traversed before a habita-
tion of any kind was reached. The lonely
journey took nine days. You can get some
idea of how he must have suffered on that
ride from the fact that he has now been
more than five weeks in hospital.
* * * *
“Drysdale”: Before every stunt Major C.
Taylor, our old co. commander, used to im-
press upon us never in any circumstances
to use our own dressing on a wounded
cobber. If he was without one then it was
a case for the bearers. (Wise enough
advice, as a man never knew when he might
need his own.) In the middle of a Passchen-
daele mix-up in October, ’l7, the Major him-
self had just finished binding up a badly-
knocked Digger, when a sniper got him
through the stomach. A couple of us crawled
across to see what could be _ done. “Let’s
have your dressing, sir,” said my cobber.
“I haven’t got one,” he replied with a
twisted smile. “I used it on «he lad over
there.” One of the bearers told me after-
wards that all the strength the poor old
chap could muster as they carried him out
was used to whisper, “Tell the boys I’ll write
to them when I get back.” He never wrote;
but a monument stands over his grave
erected by his Diggers of the old batt.

APRIL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If you would know the sweetest
Of all the year’s twelve daughters,
Go ask the Velvet breezes,
Go ask the shadowed waters.
The breezes say: “’Tis April!”
The waters in the rushes
The name of April murmur ;
“ ’Tis April,” sing the thrushes.
Her violets and dim purples,
Once seen, all folk remember,
Though she wears not the roses
That garland rich December.
September’s likest sister,
Though chastened as by duty—
Grave tasks —she yet goes costumed
In all September’s beauty.
With sighing winds to help her.
When twilight birds are calling,
’Tis she that walks the orchards,
And sets the red leaves falling.
By dawn and noon and midnight,
Soft-handed, pensive, tender,
She soothes the land, grown weary
Of too much summer splendor.
The sweetest, gravest, gentlest
Of all the year’s twelve daughters,
She muses on the mountains,
And dreams upon the waters.
N.S.W.

“Palette” : “Sowing New Seed,” the picture
which made a sensation when exhibited in
Adelaide Art Gallery, and which was ulti-
mately sent back to Orpen in exchange for a
portrait of Foch, has mow been sold by him to
Pittsburg, U.S.A. The Sunday Express has
interviewed Orpen about it. “Australia
won’t keep it,” he said. “I am branded as
immoral. I have been refused a certificate
of character down-under.” The interviewer
sums up thus :—■
Artistic criticism is becoming brighter. We arc
growing more sincere, more expressive, more
thorough. Orpen painted a picture for Australia.
The Diggers broke the glass, repainted one of the
figures, threw the picture into a dark room, and
then deported it. Otherwise they were quite mild
about the whole affair. I could see no justification
cither for his painting it or for their rejecting it.
It was neither hideous nor beautiful enough to
account for the ecstasy of creation or the joy of
demolition. That it was distinctive no one could
doubt. That it was distinctive enough for an
Australian lady to hurl a bottle through the glass
frame I stoutly deny.
But of course this last thing did not happen.
SAVED FROM THE WRECK.
“They sap she wasted every penny of his
money.”
“Not at all. The last of it paid for the
divorce .”
“Hobnobster”; I don’t know anything
about this mental telepathy, but—well,
listen. I was working on an old wind-
jammer when a young American A. 8.,
a very reserved chap, who was taking
a turn at the wheel, suddenly rushed to-
wards us sobbing like a child and crying
“My mother kissed me—mv mother kissed
me!” We couldn’t pacify him; he had
made up his nund that some calamity had
befallen his. mother. Sailor-like, we noted
down the time he had left the wheel, and
waited to see what the end of the voyage
TEE PROCESSION.
HOPKINS ( savagely ): “Tell Annie this steak is absolutely raw.”
MRS. HOPKINS: “You are six girls behind, John. This one’s name is Martha.”
would bring. At New York the young fellow
was met by a friend who gave him news
of his mother’s death. She had died at an
hour corresponding to that of the incident at
sea, and her last act, so we were told, was to
kiss the photograph of her Jim.
“Hanno”: A recent complaint by Prof.
Elliot Smith, of London, that Australian
Universities are shortsighted in appointing
Australians to vacant chairs and other jobs
isn’t well-grounded. Where
the majority of the profes-
sors and instructors have
been imported, it is impos-
sible to avoid a suggestion
of the mental inferiority of
Australians, and this feeling
is often fostered by the im-
ported men; and I cannot
conceive of anything more
damaging to a school than
to have a placard in front
of its classes: “We don’t
expect you to do very well
—you naturally can’t.” If
there were anything in Pro-
fessor Smith’s contention,-
then every English and
American University, to say
nothing of those of Europe,
should suffer from mental
short-sightedness, as they
give preference in appoint-
ments to their own gradu-
ates. At Oxford and Cam-
bridge something like 95 per
cent, of the professors and
lecturers have obtained their
degrees in the Universities
which employ them; most
of the remaining 5 per
cent, are teachers of Arabic
and such subjects. The
whole fact of the matter is
that ever since there have
been Universities in Aus-
tralia, they have been looked
upon in Britain as suitable
havens for those who, from
one reason or another, find
it hard to get jobs in their
own country, and the Eng-
lish section which has re-
garded appointments here as its own
rightful perquisites is becoming alarmed at
the possibility of the door being slammed.
“Bill Bowyang”: These globe-trotters who
write about their wanderings in unexplored
I’apua, where cannibals and sorcerers lurk
be; ad every bush, make me tired. The latest
to push his impressions into the Yankee
pap Ben Boyce, son of W. D. Boyce,
who recently visited Australia and Maori-
land and a the owner of newspapers in the
U.S.A. There’s not a square mile of
country where Eovce is meeting his cannibals
and sorcerers that was not travelled
over and rooted up by prospectors years ago.
That well-known copper seeker Captain
Osborne has combed the Astrolabe Range
territory, while Sloan and party have pros-
pected all over Papua. Even as far up-
country as Lake Ranu, Whitten Bros, run a
store, and there is also a store at Mambare.
Bug, plume and orchid hunters have prowled
over practically every foot of Papua, and
across the border into Dutch New Guinea,
and A. S. Meek, perhaps the most widely
travelled of them, always insists that he
feels in more danger in a Sydney street than
ever he did in a New Guinea jungle. What
he would feel like in Mr. Boyce’s Chicago
I don’t know; but I think he’d rush from it
in terror within 24 hours.
* * * *
“Exul”: Someone recently commented on
the unrighteousness of the law in saddling
a white man with the paternity of the half-
Chinese child of a white woman. A new
weapon has just been forged by the scien-
tists which should go far to prevent such
cases by proving that a certain man. can
not be the parent of a certain child, though
it cannot prove that he is the father of
any particular youngster. Human bloods
are divisible into four classes according to
the way the red corpuscles clump together
when'treated with other human blood sera.
It was found that it was often unsafe to
use the mother’s blood for injection into
her infant in emergencies, as clumping
occurred with disastrous results. It was
then discovered that the children inherited
their blood group from their parents accord-
ing to Mendelian principles. Thus if the
child’s blood is of class 1 and the mother’s
of class 2, the father’s must be of class 1.
and an accused male of classes 3 or 4 cannot
possibly be the heartless abandoner. Of
course, if he is unlucky enough to be of
class J the test is no use to him.
■* *• * *
“Bendy”: While we were at Tel-el-
Kebir a case of whisky arrived for the batt.
officers. It was placed just outside their
mess and a Digger put on guard. The boys
wanted that case, so Bill decided to get it.
He marched straight into the mess, and
asked the officer in charge when the next
train left for Cairo. On being told he went
outside, and standing near the whiskv called
out: “Did you sav from here, sir?” “Of
course, you fool!” came back the reply.
With a few remarks about the laziness of
officers in general, Bill picked up the case
and made off to where the mob was wait-
ing. We had a beano on the outskirts of
the camp that night; but poor old Bill had
to pay for his share—l 4 days’ c.b.
* * ■* *
“Gregor” : Fred Wreford, whose death was
reported lately (B. 2/3/’22), used to be
reckoned the luckiest man in the North-
western Pacific. Years ago he was stationed
at Morobe (New Guinea), when word came
through that a white man was lying at the
point of death near the mouth of the Mark-
ham, GO miles away by sea. As the doctor
was down with fever Fred, the only other
white at Morobe at the time, decided to go
to the rescue himself, and he set out alone
in the battered old oil-launch belonging to
the station. W r hen about half-way he lit
the primus to boil the billy, and suddenly the
stove “burst.” Wreford seized the blazing
thing and in dipping it over the side lost his
balance and went overboard with it. The
launch continued to chug away with nobody
aboard it, and left Wreford tu a very watery
view of life about seven miles from shore.
Just as he was giving bimself up for lost, to
his astonishment he saw the empty launch
beginning to describe a circle. Something had
gone wrong with its steering-gear! It came
round m a wide sweep that carried it to
within a few feet of where Wreford was
fading water, and he had no difficulty in
grabbing one of the ropes along its side and
hauling himself aboard again. It was charac-
teristic ot the. man that he said nothing
about the incident until nearly a month
later. -Then, one night, half a dozen of us
\\ ei e yarning on the verandah of the hospital
bungalow, and the conversation happened to
™ ei \ to the art of falling overboard,
lie told us about it then in a matter-of-fact
<iy as though such things were everyday
occurrences, scarcely worth remembering.

,“S. Gunu” : Baron von Eckardstein, the
tall Silesian who was an Australian Gover-
ness s first husband, tells some racy yarns
of royalty in his lately-published memoirs.
One concerns Edward the Seventh and
another bon vivant of the period. Edward
had invited himself and 15 others (George
V. among them) to dine with the Eckard-
steins at Cowes. But a grave difficulty
presented itself :—•
One of our house-party was the well-known
Admiral Lord Charles Beresford. Between him and
the Prince of Wales there had been for eight years
a deadly feud, as they had fallen out over the favors
of one of the best-known society beauties. What
was I to do ? The Portuguese Ambassador and 1
walked up and down the Esplanade and racked our
brains in vain. W T hile still so engaged we saw a
well-known hostess hurrying up to us. Said she: “I
hear that dear old Charlie Beresford is staying with
you. I have just written and asked him to dine
with us on our yacht. J hope you and the Baroness
can spare him for this night.”
Charlie was spared for the night, and Ed-
ward was spared the hateful presence of the
peer who (presumably) “pinched his tart.”
* * * * •
“Macquarie Street”: During the swelter-
ing heat of a March week no less than 145
young men and women have been sitting
(stewing would be a better word) for the
final M.B. of Sydney University. Suppose
that out of this number 100 become entitled
to face the Chancellor, what on earth is
going to become of them? We old hands
hear almost pathetic reports of the position
of young graduates who obeyed their coun-
try’s call overseas, and it is not unreason-
able to believe, that the outlook for the
newly-fledged will be worse still. Why does
not the University resolve to admit a cer-
tain number of med. students per year and
no more? It is done elsewhere: why not
here? No other remedy for a thoroughly
unsatisfactory state of affairs has been sug-
gested. The. mostly-stupid public doesn’t
realise that it is interested. But when it
gets its doctor’s bill and finds that an under-

THE INSTRUCTOR: “Oh, no. They don't
have to look at the drawings that arc
done of them unless they like.”
worked man has popped in for a dozen
•‘visits'’ when four would seem to have been
enough, it may begin to refleet that it is
deeply interested in this multiplication of
the superfluous.
If charity it is that halts
At sins and covers up our faults,
Consider can we praise enough
The virtues of a powder-puff?

APPLIED ASTRONOMY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He took me out to see the stars,
That astronomic bore;
He said there were two moons near Mars,
\\ hile Jupiter had four.
1 thought, of course, he’d whisper soon
What fourfold bliss ’tvvould be
i’o stroll beneath that fourfold moon
On Jupiter with me.
And when he spoke of Saturn’s ring
I was convinced he’d say
That was the very kind of thing
To offer me some day.
But in a tangent off he went
To double stars. Now that
Mas more suggestive, so content
And quite absorbed I sat.
But, no ! ITe talked a dreary mess
Of which the only fraction
That caught my fancy, I confess,
Was “mutual attraction.”
T said 1 thought it very queer
And stupid altogether
For stars to keep so very near
And yet not come together.
At that he smiled and turned his head ;
I thought he’d caught the notion.
He merely bowed good-night and said
Their safety lay in motion.

‘Papua”: I support “McNorth” (B.
26/l/’22) re tobacco in Papua. It seems to be
indigenous, for the first recorded reference to the Mas
dos Papuas mentions tobacco. Leaving the coast out
of the argument facts all point to the highlanders
having cultivated and used the weed for centuries.
On the Lakekamu Goldfield in 1011 I saw miners
unearth stone pestles that had rested over 50ft.
below the primeval jungle, and among the debris
at that depth were a number of chunks of petrified
wood. Two pieces on examination under a micro-
scope showed the fibrous tissue of bamboo, and both
aboriginal and white observers voted them frag-
ments of ancient bamboo pipes. I, too, have been
right to the interior of Papua, and can corroborate
“McNorth’s” statement regarding the excellent
tobacco; grpwn on the slopes around Mt. St. Mary,
and even further on beyond the former Anglo-Germun
border. Leaves as large as an ordinary card-table
were common, and the smoking quality when made
into crude cigars was very good to a man who
had been without a smoke for many days. Other
wanderers over Papua, civil and official, are with
me in the belief that tobacco is indigenous to the
great island.
“Jim Carew”: When I returned from
Westralia 20-odd years back I brought several boom-
erangs. They looked very like the N.S.W. kind, but
the abos. over here were unable to throw them at
all. Several Binghis tried, and although they held
the kylie in every way they knew how they could
do nothing with it. Any Abo. explain why?
• # * •
“Gouger”: Up on the Alice River (Cape
York Peninsula) there is a bird that garners the
berries from branches overhanging the stream. While
hopping from branch to branch he frequently stops
to emit a shrill whistle. Both saw-fish and barra-
mundi come to this call and compete for the stray
berries that the bird shakes down. Binghi, knowing
all this, crouches behind the tree trunk, picks out
the fattest fish and spears it. Thus three feeds are
on their way at once —for bird, fish and nigger.
When the bird is away on other business Binghi
simply hides behind the berry-tree, imitates the
breakfast whistle, the hungry guests turn up, the
fish-spear transfixes one in a second and—there you
are. But I reckon this imitation business is play-
ing the game a bit low down.
“F.C.L.”: How is this for breathlessness?
At Broome (W.A.) I saw a native diver go down for
7min. lOsec. by stopwatch. When he came to the
surface blood was streaming from him, but in a
few minutes he recovered.
* * '# •
“Ragar”: The “boo,” or conch-shell, is
almost universally used by the islanders throughout
the Pacific as a means of attracting attention,
signalling, or merely kicking up a row in the way
of letting off steam. While anchored off one of the
islands in Torres Strait 1 heard one of these shells
being blown from somewhere out to sea in the dark-
ness. One of my “boys” granted, and in answer
to my question told me: “That peller ’e catch ’em
plenty peller turtle; pive peller and pive peller ’e
catch ’em.” Again the faint booming sound reached
us through the night haze, and I was told the name
of the boat and where they had been to catch ’.he
turtle. There is some code used by the islanders
by which they communicate on dark nights from
boat to shore, and vice versa. The natives in the
eastern end of the Strait are Papuans with a mixture
of other blood, while the western end of the strait
has islanders who are plainly Australian aborigines.
The Papuan element uses the “boo” for signalling
mostly, but the other crowd are satisfied with it
as a row-producer.
* * * *
“Ishmael” : Near Innamincka (S.A.)
recently I noticed what appeared to be a large
cocoon of silky material. It was slung between
the branches of a small gum and would have
measured about 6in. the long way and 4in. the short.
I was about to investigate further, when the mail-
driver warned me that I would itch for days after
if I touched the darned thing, so I didn’t. He
could not tell me what insect was responsible, but
perhaps the Abo. Council will know. The color
was similar to that of the coins we sometimes
saw in the long ago. Quids I think they called
them.
* * * •
“Big Bend”: In testing that almost-general
bush belief of snakes not being able to crawl over
a rope, “Jim Carew” (B. 16/2/’22) probably used an
ordinary manila rope. Let him try the same experi-
ment with a hair rope, and I think he’ll regain his
faith in the old belief. Linoleum is also a good
safeguard against snakes. Last week a brown
crawler at our homestead was travelling at a great
rate for safety when he wriggled on to the linoleum-
covered verandah-porch. Directly he got on to the
smooth surface he could make no further progress and
fell an easy victim to the person with the axe.
* * * *
“T.W.”: One wet season in Maitland
(N.S.W.) district—if a record of ’6B is correct—the
lucerne on the flats swarmed with aphis, and the
pests tackled the horses in these pasturages.
Strangely enough they selected only animals which
had bald (i.e., white) faces, white stripes on their
foreheads, or white fetlocks The aphis caused
intense irritation, and horses often rubbed the skin
off their foreheads in the effort to get rid of the pest.
Cows were also attacked, but in their case the aphis
clustered mostly about the teats. Kerosene was found
to be the most effectual remedy.
# * * •
“F.D.D.”: “Frank White’s’’Yankee (B.
23/2/’22) who bet on the eucalyptus being a native
of the U.S.A. is no exception. Californians believe
the wattle to be indigenous to their State. An
attempt on the part of an indignant Australian
(myself) to convince them of their error was met
with politely ir credulous smiles. They call it “our
acacia.”
“Tataria”: When the ’flu blew into Papua
last September the nigs, attributed it to a malignant
spirit and at several villages they exorcised the
unwelcome spook in typical Stone Age fashion,
The women brought forward all the broken and dis-
used earthenware cooking-pots, which they filled
WOMEN AND WIDES.
BLUE STOOKING: “Don't you think women’s aims are as lofty as men's?”
SILK SOCKS: "Yes, quite. Only not as straight.”
with rotting yams, potatoes and pumpkins. Then,
after placing the food on the leeward side of the
village, the men formed into a procession, and
beating drums, banging tins, and blowing ear-pierc-
ing bamboo whistles they marched down the single
street to the place where the pots had been piled.
This was to let the spirit know that he wasn’t
wanted any longer in that part of the country.
The savage may be ignorant, but he sets a great
value on a broad hint; and as the disease shortly
departed the brown folk are firmly’ convinced they
had a win.
* * * *
“F.H.R.”: Did I ever tell you about my
discovery’ on an old diggings a few miles from
Kerr’s Creek (N.S.W.) ? In an old bark hut, the
door of which was shut, I found everything just as
its owner had left it when he went to work; but
grass was growing up around the mildewed blankets on
the bunk, and the old tinned plate and the knife and
fork were encrusted with rust. There was nothing to
give me a clue as to the hatter’s identity or how he
.met his end, but I don’t doubt that “down under,’’
where some rotten prop had given way, he sleeps
as peacefully as if an undertaker had tucked him

A PARTING SHOT.
MAID (fed up): “Gam, yer that fussy you’ll
want yer asbestos sheets changed every
day when you’re dead.”
“Steve Hart”: Here’s an almost infallible
cure for ‘V.I.B.’s” prad (B 9/‘>/>9o', which object-
to being caught. Put him in a five-acre paddock for
the night, with no hobbles or other gear on Go
after him next morning with a bridle and stockwhip
Of course he’ll skedaddle for his life Lut vou need
not move far from the middle of the paddock. Just
keep stepping towards him, never letting him stop
an easy job in a small paddock. You may have
to keep going a long while before he shows signs
of giving in, and when he does, get the whip crack-
*nf? but don’t hit him. After a few more miles
round the paddock you’ll catch him easily. Give
him a feed, and the trouble’s over for good. But
don’t hit him ; pet him when caught.
“FY7”: Tell “Bill R.” (R. 2/3/’22 i
that many lady dogs, particularly those of high
degree, will devour their puppies, especially if the
litter is handled or inspected too much. Airedales
and collies have a reputation for this practice, and
I knew a fox-terrier to indulge in it. The remed\
is to isolate the lady and her family and leave them
alone for ten days or so. Cats—including Zoo
lions and tigers—have the same weird habit at times,
and even Mrs. Rabbit, if one of the caged, fancy
breeds, has been known to turn cannibal if the family
pri\ acy is disturbed. Lord knows w’hat queer animal
psychology is at the botton of it all, but some
dread of outside interference with the ’ kids seems
to be the underlying motive.

“Rae-akiaki”: A recent landslide at
Waiotapu, 30 miles from Rotorua (M.L.), disclosed
a buried rimu forest. The trees are so petrified that
they turn the edge of an axe and cannot be cut.
At another point the slip of a cliff has revealed rimu
trees, about 3ft. in diameter, piled as though
swept down by some great flood. The trees were
buried under 30ft. or 40ft. of pumice soil, and while
those near the surface of the high, land have turned
to charcoal, those embedded in the moist soil are
still in excellent condition and are being used by
the settlers for fencing. The devastation must have
been caused through an eruption centuries ago.
Incidentally, these disclosures help to strengthen
the opinion that the Pink and White Terraces were
not destroyed, but merely buried.

“Veronal”: Few wild birds are bold enough
to feed with domestic fowls, but the bald coot
(water-hen) and the peaceful or ground dove are
among the exceptions, while during a heavy snowfall
in the Speck bell-magpies and a few soldier-birds
(garrulous minahs) came and shared the chooks’
food. The impertinent house-sparrow is also an
exception, but he is an alien and doesn’t count.
Sometimes, but rarely, ornate gold-finches hover
around while the chickens are breakfasting. These
handsome little birds often cling to the yellow
blooms of the small garden sunflower while feeding,
and as their own coloring harmonises with that of
the plant and its flowers, the result is very decora-
tive.

THE ORGANIST AND ME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last Sunday night I went to church;
I’d worked throughout the day,
And seven days all working days
Leave one unfit to pray ;
I struggled hard to keep awake
To please my family ;
There were but two men in the church —
The organist and me.
But it was filled with women folk,
And some had contrite hearts;
Some came to flaunt their finery,
And some to play their parts ;
The organist with hands and feet
Stuck to it manfully ;
But when we sang you could not hear
The organist or me.
Of course the minister was there.
So tall and gaunt and slim
(Some say they are a sex apart,
And I’d forgotten him) ;
He preached against the sins of men
And their iniquity;
I’m not sure which he blamed the most,
The organist or me.
My thoughts kept straying as I sat
To women’s ways and whims;
I reckoned up the length of tongue
They wagged to sing the hymns;
And then I dozed and dreamt a dream,
A great calamity,
For all the tongues were nagging at
The organist and me. •
A deaconess took round the plate;
I felt her gliding by,
And as 1 fumbled for the coin
I quailed beneath her eye;
The freewill offerings were small.
The modest thrippenny—
The only copper coins came from
The organist and me.
MYSTERIES.
"It surprises me how you unemployed keep
so wonderfully well-conditioned .”
” Yers . and it paralyses me how yous hard-
working blokes manages to keep yer
fat."
1 am not sure about the text.
For it was getting late—
Twas of the days when Philip had
A eunuch for a mate;
And when the parson mentioned him
I was inclined to flee—
The way the women glared 'at', us,
The organist and me!
I heaved a sigh when they began
To chant the vesper hymn,
And saw the parson slinking out
So gaunt and tall and slim ;
And then he wished us all good night
(The women tenderly),
And shook the hands of all except
The organist and me.

“The Outsider”: Narrow escapes? In
Wolfram Camp (N.Q.) in ’lB, a miner lit three
charges and gave the braceman the order “Haul
away.” When the bucket was about 12ft. up the
shaft the rope gave way and the miner hit the
bottom of the shaft in a hurry. He took a risk
and pulled two of the fuses; and then flung himself
down as the third reached the cap. A cut or two
was the total damage.
* * * #
“The Rumpus”: “Jim Carew” says (B.
9/2/’22) that small black ants will invade their
white brothers and wipe them out. That was blown
out in The Bulletin- over 20 years ago. But while
on the subject let me introduce the brainy little
black ant of Westralia. My compulsory pastime is
chopping wood in the bush, mostly green jarrah.
The trees have dead patches in them, which are
riddled with juicy bardies, but no ant can pene-
trate their recesses, except the white ant, which
does not include meat in his menu. After the first
couple of cuts, the scent of the freshly-liberated sap
penetrates the air, and all the tribes of blaxdc ants
within a radius of about 100 yards prepare to march
to the scene. They are actually there when the
jarrah falls, ready to carry off bardies for break-
fast.
HE MISTOOK HIS PART.
“I married him because I thought he was
like a Greek god."
“And didn’t he turn out like one?"
"Ye-e-es. But the wrong one. I'd for-
gotten Bacchus."
“Mulga”: Re natal impromptus. She was
a railway ganger’s wife in the bush. When Dad
arrived home one night she told him something that-
made him bundle her on to his rail tricycle, and in
a drizzling rain start out on a 20-mile run to a
maternity home and medico. They hadn’t got half-
way when he had to stop, and a young Aussie was
born beside the line. Dad completed the journey
alone, and after motoring back over a rough track
he and the med. located the mother and child per
lantern at 11 p.m. When the doctor had done all
he could for his two patients he walked a mile in
the dark to the homestead of a wealthy widower
squatter and asked a night’s lodging for mother
and child—and was refused.-
"J.H.S.”: “S’fact” nominates the dingo
(B. 19/l/’22) as the hardest dier in the bush,
but I’ll put my spuds on the carpet-snake.
I have seen these reptiles belabored until their
bodies were a mass of bruises and their heads bat-
tered and crushed, yet a few hours later they have been
well on the way to recovery, though their heads were
THE DISCRIMINATING BURGLAR.
"Hullo, Brown. Sorry to hear you had burglars in the other night. How did they
treat you?"
"Oh, pretty decent. They merely bound me, but they bound and gagged the wife."
swollen to twice the natural size. My brother and
I one morning “killed” a 12ft. specimen on our
way to work, and with the thoroughness of boys
made a perfect job of it. In the evening we went
to have another look at our victim; but it had ske-
daddled. A broad trail across some ashes told us
what had happened. Another time a battered eight-
footer, after being dragged for two miles over
Sticks and logs to be proudly displayed to a family
of newchums, had to be “killed” again. The only
certain way of finishing a large carpet-snake is to
lop liis head off.
* * * #
“Wild Oat”: “Theo. D. Lite” (8.9/3/’22)
asks how to stiffen the brim of a felt hat. Tell him
to make a 6 to 1 solution of sugar and water, damp
the affected part and iron when nearly dry.
“Dingaan”: Re rifles (B.
16/2/’22). Recently my .32.40 Winchester made
such a mess of a rosella at 30yds. that
we wondered if we’d exploded a Mills
bomb. All we recovered after a search
was one wing—which goes to show that
the .32-40 soft-nosed bullet doesn’t have
far to go before breaking up. But for
deer or ’roo-shooting give me every time
a Boer Mauser rifle (stock cut down to
sporting shape), with soft-nosed bullets.
It is a high-velocity weapon hafd to beat,
and its flat trajectory dispenses with any
adjustment of sights at ordinary ranges.
It will pulverise the toughest ’roo.
“Paul”: On George AVallis’s Stumpy’s
Flat, Hastings River (N.S.W.), there , is a
bullock yoke that has been in almost constant
service for 60 years. It was used chiefly as a “pole”
yoke in the days when the wool teams brought
their loads over the range from New England to
Port Macquarie, and since then it has helped to
haul mill logs and girders, clear land and till the
soil. It is made of apple-tree timber.
“Ben Johnson” (Rhodesia) : I’m with
“Paul C.” (B. 20/10/’2l) re snakes doing the can-
nibal act. A few days ago I shot the head off a
sft. black cobra, and on opening him found he had
swallowed an almost full-grown puff-adder. As for
“Wandi's” old shepherd (B. 20/10/’2l) who cured
snakebite by letting his dog lick the scarified
wound, the comment that occurs to me is, why try
it on the dog? I have cured the bites of puff-adder,
black cobra and viper by cutting well into the
punctures made by the two poison fangs, sucking the
wound vigorously, and afterwards rubbing into the
gash permanganate of potash. Finely powdered
permanganate has the speediest action..
“Veronal”: It has been lately proposed
to re-name the laughing Jack (Dacelo gigas)
and award him Dacelo nova, guinea as his scientific
terminal. The compilers of “Phillip’s Voyage”
credited this cachinnatory fowl to New Guinea, but,
in point of fact, he doesn’t range as far as that island.
Greg Mathews has busied himself in creating fan-
tastic namesj for certain sub-orders of birds, such as
Harriwhitea and Tavistocka. The first honors H. h.
White, of Belltrees (N.S.W.), who has done much
for Australian ornithology, and is an Australian;
but the Marquis of Tavistock, beyond rearing some
of the Australian parrots in England, is unconnected
with our warblers. Some of the new names are
calculated to cause John Gould to turn in his grave.
"Crooked Sam”: Re snakebite trouble
recurring. I was bitten by a black snake when I was
a boy of 10. Next day I was all right and I did not
feel any after-effects till, 11 years later, I was
asked to do something for a boy who had been
bitten on the foot and ankle, also by a black snake.
Immediately I entered the room where the patient
was I could have screamed with the pain in the
spot where I had been bitten. When I went outside
the pain vanished, but it returned when I re-entered
the room. No symptoms of snakebite were apparent
-—only violent pain. Nervous sympathy or what?
“Bendy”: “Jackeroo’s” story (B. 2/3/’22)
of the two women swaggies recalls a lady who
humped matilda through the Mallee district (Vic.)
some years ago. She was a champion at cutting
wood, and always insisted on “chopping a bit”
before allowing her tucker-bag to be replenished.
Repeated offers of a good job failed to induce her
to settle down. “This life’ll do me,” was her
reply to all inquiries.
* * * *
“T.A.L.”: “V. 1.8.” (B. 9/2/’22) can put
a “come hither” on his yarrarhan that objects to
be caught. The trick is done by fastening a chain
about 6ft. long to a strong strap round his throat,
the chain being just long enough to drag on the
ground about 2ft. between his front legs. An old trace
chain with the hook chopped off is just the thing.
“Yal” : The trinity of Imlay brothers who
settled in the N.S.W. South Coast district in the
early twenties of last century, and about whom “Te
Whare” (B, 15,/12/’2l) and “D.F.” (B. 29/12/’2l)
sought information, were the sons of a naval surgeon
of Aberdeenshire who went to Australia from that
rather cold, but clean, place about that period.
Following the - traditions of their family, who
had been medicoes for many generations, the three
brothers were all surgeons in the service, Alexander
in the Navy, and George and Peter in the Army.
Peter went to Maoriland and took up land on the
Wanganui, naming it Balgownie, a link with Aber-
deen: the estate is still in his family and the town
of Imlay stands there as his memorial. Alexander
and George settled near Eden, and Imlay Shire,
Mt. Imlay and Dr. George Mountain stand as
their memorials. They were men of some character,
and stories of them are remembered to this day in
the district. Both are buried on Tarraganda, a
piopertv they lent and which was never recovered.
Geoige did not marry, as far as was known;
Alexandei did, and imparted his ability to his son
Alexander, w'ho after a brilliant academical career
and many wanderings, including service in the
N.Z. war, also developed the pioneering instinct
in the Never-Never district of Queensland. His
brother James left for foreign parts, and a town
to his memory exists in U.S.A. to-day. This
Alexander died in 1888, and his two sons, Alex, and
Norman, are good Aussies. They are also wanderers
one is in India and the other in Papua ; and if it
hadn't been against the rules of the Medes and
the Persians The Bulletin could, I think, have
mentioned straight off that it knew them both as
contributors. Both had five years of war with the
A.1.P., the former attaining the rank of Lt.-Colonel
commanding a Queensland batt. in the hard-fighting
4th Divvy, getting a D.S.O. and bar and a few
wounds; the latter a captaincy, M.C. and a few
wounds also. A sister put in the same period as
Sister in the A.A.N.S.
* * * •
“Pick”: These instances go to prove that
a dying horse seeks the aid of his master. Darkie,
the stock horse of a Bibbenluke herdsman, had been
turned out in a back pad lock to recover from
strangles. He jumped the intervening wire fences,
galloped home, and fell dead with his head on the
doorway of his owner’s hut. A Bombala (N.S.W.)
butcher once burst a valuable mare in running
wild bullocks from Jincumbilly. That night she
broke through his front-garden gate, and with her
nose pushed on the paries of his bedroom window.
She was dead on the verandah when he turned out
to see who wanted him. On Tantawango Mountain
one snowy night a falling limb struck old Blossom,
a draught of Warburton’s team. Her struggling
tracks in the snow were traced for half-a-mile
across Badgery’s swamps to the teamster’s camp,
and next morning her crashed form was discovered
beside the waggon.
* * * •
“Digger Too”: Re “Steve Hart” and his
jumping death-adder (B. 16/2/’22). In a west
Queensland scrub in 1914 my mate found an adder
about ISin. long, and told me to watch as he poked
it with a brush hook. It immediately drew itself
into the shape of a letter “S,” and on being poked
again struck the steel end of the hook with a click
like the snap of a squad fixing bayonets. It was
a darned smart adder, but it didn’t rise 2in. off
the ground, let alone 9ft. Incidentally, the settlers
in that part (Undulla Creek) say the death-adder
skin assumes the color of the ground it lives on.
* * * *
“Rag”: Your true Scot wouldn’t have
even a bath go to waste. One Sunday forenoon we
lav sweltering on the bungalow verandah at Galley
Beach (Papua) when Scotty arrived after a strenu-
ous three-mile struggle through shoulder-high cane
grass. As he stood all grimy and gasping before
us we thought to alleviate his distress by ordering
the “boy” to prepare a tub for him. “No! no!
Don’t trouble y’selves,” said the Gael' earnestly,
“Ai had a vera guid sweat cornin’ ower.”
* * * »
“Ben Johnson” (Rhodesia) : “J.L.” (B.
20/10/’2l) says the okapi is a cross between the
giraffe and zebra. Round my little hole in the
bush (it is 240 miles from the nearest pub) giraffe
and zebra are common. A good-sized giraffe will
top 18fit. The zebra is what you might class, for
size, as a substantial donkey. And I’ve never heard
of them using stilts. The giraffe, moreover, has a
cloven lioof, in addition to its other bovine charac-
teristics. To say the least, I thing “J.L.” is coming
down pretty hard on poor old Nature when he says
she has effected this cross.
“Jobber”: Re “Ross’s” inquiry (B.
2/3/’22) whether killing and dressing a sheep in
lmin 30sec. is a record. Let me once more remark
that Braddick—known to his intimates as “Butcher”
—was years ago the champion slaughterman at
Glebe Island (Sydney). His fastest time for killing
and dressing a jambuck was 59 seconds.
LENIENCY.
THE POET: “I’ve called about some verses
that appeared in this week's number of
the BANG-CRASH CITIZEN. Now, as
regards payment”
THE EDITOR: “Oh, that’s all right, old men.
I’ve consulted the manager , and we’ve
decided not to charge you for it.”
A SONG OF BREAD AND DUST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am not weary of wide, green ways
Nor the glad, fresh call of morning birds ;
I love the wind of the world that plays
In anil out of the, joy of words—
Out and in through the rhythm and phrase;
For always the silver of dreams is there,
An argent light on the marching days,
A glitter of hope on the moving air.
But I grow weary of roof and stone,
Pavemenr and window and turning door,
The lane that lives to itself alone,
The wall that climbs to the tenth grey floor
And looks not skyward, but down to the street,
Asking alms of the passers-by,
Alms of trade from the restless feet
That scrape forever and know not why.
He who has sown in the good brown field
Knows the meaning of sheath and blade,
And his heart can sing of the brave earth’s yield.
Feeling the sweat of which bread is made.
Feeling the thought that is more than bread,
A pen has joy of the fair black ink ;
This that the heart of a man has said
To the soul of a man is meat and drink.
He who sows in the hard grey street
Figure on figure and pound on pound,
What shall the seasons lay at his feet?
IVhat shall he win as the earth goes round?
\\ hat shall he win but a figure more
And a louder cry for the alms of trade,
While the grey dust lies a t the office door
And never of dust is a man’s bread made?
Joy of green ways and joy of clear words—
Words of the pen or words of the brush—
Flight of fancy or flight of birds—
Silver of morning and sunset flush—
Silver of dreaming or gold hard won—
Which shall a soul from the darkness save ?
Grey from the street with the day half-done
Ts the dust at the door of a walled half-grave!

Constant hot water day or night in
quantities from 20 to 2000 gallons per
hour according to size of boiler, at lowest
cost. The “Ideal” Domestic Boiler takes
up little room and is easily installed in
any kitchen. It burns coke, coal or wood
as well as dry household rubbish.
The “Ideal” Boiler furnishes 50 gallons
of really hot water from 91b. of coke.
The fire requires stoking at long intervals
only, and the slow combustion principle
reduces the fuel to a fine ash. “Ideal”
installations have reduced fuel bills by
half.
By banking the fire at night you econo-
mise fuel and ensure an ample supply of
hot water for early morning use.

Gelett Burgess maintains that the test of
good nonsense is its quotability. He him-
self is certainly quotable : —
I never saw a purple cow,
1 never hope to see one;
But I can tell you anyhow
I’d rather see than be one.
Again:—
I’d rather have habits than clothes,
For that’s where my intellect shows.
And as to my hair,
Bo you think .1 should care
To comb it at night with my toes ?
Whnt are half our nursery rhymes but non-
sense verses; and what a vitality they have!
At times the foolish stanza may even be
witty, but then it tends to overstep the
bounds and enter a foreign domain. Amus-
ing as this quatrain may be, I doubt whether
it can be fairly classified as nonsense verse:
At first they fought with tooth and tongue,
But when it came to blows,
' The man who had the strongest lung
Blew oil' the other’s nose.
Humorous if you will, but not fine nonsense
m the best sense at all. Greatly daring,
let me quote m conclusion a quaint Limerick
that has brought a smile to the lips of my
most inveterate wowser acquaintance:—
There was a young lady called Banker,
\\ ho slept while the ship lay at anchor,
But woke in dismay
When she heard the mate say,
•Now hoist up the top-sheet and spanker/*
th ,V s * s „ a blending 0 f w it anc ] humor
;ma drollery, . I hear the critic cry protest-
'ngly, ‘and violates your own distinctions.”
Jo which I answer obtusely and obduratelv
— Nonsense, sir, nonsense!”
P. ALREY
Simplicity—and Woman
With a tired theatrical company I was
awaiting a goods-train at 3 o'clock in the
morning, and a newspaper girl, who was
doing the tour with us, lent me a copy of
Compton Mackenzie’s “Carnival.” She was
reviewing it for a daily paper and recom-
mended it. Y\ hile she dozed 1 read, by the
flickering railway-lamp, the middle and the
beginning and the end of the tale. Then I
handed it over to the yawning comedian,
wno turned over the pages and read me end,
the middle and the beginning, and passed it
on to the villain. So it went from hand to
nand until it came back to me, I returned it
to its owner with the comment, “it does to
kill time, doesn’t it?” Her scorn was superb.
Here s a leading lady who prefers Charles
Garviee to Compton Mackenzie !” she cried
• Why, Mackenzie is one of the greatest of
living novelists!” Everyone was much too
tired to be. upset by the news. But when 1
was less sleepy I bought tfie book anti found
it not so had when you skipped the gutters
and kept to the open road of the yarn.
I have not been able to finish a novel for
years, and Vance Palmer recently hit the
chief reason the narrative goes to pot every
tew minutes; construction sinks into “local
color,” and dialogue, and situation degenerate
into mere atmosphere, so that it takes an
expert to dig the yarn ..out. I am not an
expert.
A critic told me recently that I should read
Ceorge Moore. 1 got a copy of “Esther
W aters” and tried to be interested. But at
page 50 I put the book down and decided
that style in fiction may cover a multitude of
crimes, but will not hold au audience that
wants a story.
George Moore reminds me that I once
bought a copy of “Evelyn Innes” for an ex-
barmaid who lived in the same hoarding-
house. Her method adopted to get me inter-
ested in the lady was thrilling. She came
and knocked on my door mysteriously at mid-
night. When I said “Come in,” she
entered with unbound tresses, and sat on the
edge of my bed fingering a sixpence. “I’m
going to ask you to do something for me,”
she whispered. Seeing the sixpence I hesi-
tated. But. friendship is friendship in a
lonely boarding-house; and I said: “I’ll do
anything you like so long as it isn’t some-
thing I can’t do.” Then she stole across the
floor in her bare feet and said jii a whisper:
“Would you buy me a copy of ‘Evelyn Innes’
when you are in town to-morrow?” “With
pleasure,” I replied, holding out my hand for
her sixpence. “Are you game?” she said,
with a little surprise. I was quite game.
I walked into a bookshop and, taking my
cue from the barmaid, I whispered to a
gentleman “‘Evelyn Innes’? Have you a
copy?” “Shall I wrap it up Miss?”'whis-
pered the man. But I was fed up with the
whispering and took the lady out into the
light of day just as she was. I tried to find
her entertaining all the way home. But
somehow, her limbs were always getting in
the way of the story, abd she was far too
complicated a being for a woman.
The simplest thing ever created is a woman.
A member of my own sex years ago pointed
that out to me. It was Beatrice Day. We
were playing in the same show —I as a model
in A. H. Adams’s “Doctor Death”; she as
the woman in Shaw’s “Man of Destiny.” As
befitted the part of the subtle female she
was portraying that evening she was stand-
ing at the door of her dressing-room polish-
ing her already-perfect nails ; and I was sitting
on a chair outside of the room carefully and
methodically going over my lines. “This is
your first appearance, isn’t it?” she asked.
“Absolutely.” T answered, calmly proceeding
with my mumbled lines. “And aren’t you
nervous?” she said, lifting a thumb-nail
s'leaming like polished pearl to the light
“Not a bit,” I replied. “Then you’ll never
make an actress,” she stated promptly.
“Ellen Terry once said to me: ‘Mv dear, ner-
vousness is the secret of all artistic achieve-
ment. An actress who is not nervous mi«-ht
as well give up the stage.’” I still went
on saying my lines, and. as a matter of fact
all I thought of the remark was: “I don’t
believe Ellen Terry did tell her that. That
bit of advice is just to let me know she once
spoke to Ellen Terry. She read it some-
where.” Then she went on and the anxious
playwright came behind the scenes to see if
his model was safe, only to find her shudder-
ing in her velvet dress and the rose in her coat
trembling like an aspen leaf. Miss Day
passed me and I said, clasping my hands
u la Ellen Terry, “Oh, I am so nervous.”
“You aren’t,” she returned. “You’re only
saying that because I told you what Ellen
Terry said.” And honestly that’s why I was
saying it; actually my nerves were so per-
fectly steady from my entrance to my exit
that I not only remembered all I had to say
but was able to prompt a fellow-mummer
who had forgotten his lines.
We women all have these simple little
ways of dealing with one another in real life;
but we never do it in fiction.
ZORA CROŚ.
Music and Alcohol
During the last few years two movements
have gained momentum in a great part of
the civilised world ; one negative, aggressive
and noisy, the other positive and working
quietly. One aims at liquor prohibition,
the other at the spread of music as a mental
and moral tonic. On the surface they have
little likeness; yet they have some common
ground. Both profess a similar aim, namely,
the increase of the happiness and well-
being of mankind. But while one seeks
to impose restrictions, the other seeks to
give freedom. The first would deprive men
of something which marry regard as a means
of innocent social and physical stimulus
and enjoyment when properly used; the
second seeks to give something which would
add immeasurably to that enjoyment, and
provide healthy and much-needed stimulus
and recreation.
Some years ago Sir Robert Anderson,
writing with great experience of crime and
criminals, considered that many working
men drink for the same reason as those of
a more favored class attend theatres, con-
certs and other places of amusement. They
seek relief and temporary oblivion from
the monotony and drudgery of their daily
lives. He wrote before the advent of pic-
ture shows, but his conclusions still hold
good. So also Pierre .Janet, the eminent
French psychologist and mental specialist,
points out that alcoholism is often at bottom
merely one of the impulses towards stimu-
lation for the relief of mental depression
in the face of the calls which life makes
upon us—calls to which some people find
it hard to respond without stimulus. He
says: "We must combat the exclusiveness
of the impulse. We must seek other sources
of stimulation. We must make people per-
ceive that there are stimuli of a mental
nature. We should try to lessen the craving
for stimulation by decreasing depression and
by raising the psychic tension bv anv means
possible.”
Music offers one normal and readily-
obtained solution of the difficulty. To under-
stand why we must learn something of the
working of the conscious and sub-conscious
mind and energy, and the effects of alcohol
and recreation upon these.
Man has two departments in his mind
and nature. One is the conscious, every-
day mind and energy, mental and physical ;
it forms, so to speak, his ordinary work-
ing income, which lie pays out in the form
of daily use and expenditure of energy in
his work. In addition the normal individual
has capital in the bank, in the shape Of a
reserve of energy and mental force, which
is , stored like a reservoir in his sub-con-
scious ihind and nature, and is both physical
and spiritual. Except when stirred up or
requisitioned by some extra call, strain or
shock, this energy is not immediately avail-
able for use. We normally reach it through
some kind of recreation —re-creation. Wo
play games to reach and obtain fresh sup-
plies of physical and mental energy. We
seek excitement in some form to arouse our
hidden stores of vitality and make them
available for our use.
Musical and dramatic entertainments offer
in some ways the most ready access to this
sub-conscious energy. Music stirs up and
brings to conscious life the sub-conscious
energy to which it directly appeals, and
is, therefore, when rightly used and under-
stood, one of the finest tonics iu the world,
physical as well as mental and spiritual.
Alcohol also reaches and releases some of
this energy. It sets aside the control of
the conscious mind, and lets fresh
energy come up to the surface. But
the energy so released is animal and phy-
sical in nature. Herein lies its danger,
along with a detrimental effect on the body.
Animal energy is good in itself and in its
proper place. But the man or woman
who habitually sets free much of this through
the use of drink or drugs is giving the reins
of government to the lower energies, and
is dethroning the higher mental and spiri-
tual energies. Music, on the other hand,
offers legitimate escape from the pettiness
and grimness of the daily round and struggle
for existence. It releases the mind from
the thraldom of the every-day necessities
of life, and sets it free to wander in the
larger temple of the spirit, bringing to view
a new and more spacious world which lies
hidden within each one of us, and to which
music gives the magic key. It frees both
animal and spiritual energies, each in its
proper proportion, when used aright, and
brings us back to the workaday world re-
freshed.
The recent movement which led to the
establishment of a fine orchestra in Aus-
tralia is thus something far more than the
mere provision of a new nmusenv>nt. It is
literally providing a new fund of life, health
and energy. And the national import-
ance of that lies in the fact that it
is not enough to prevent human beings
from obtaining too readily a source of
stimulus which is dangerous if mis-
used, and which must inevitably bring
ruin to many who cannot use it wisely. We
must seek also to provide something healthy
and unharmful to take its place: something
which can release and quicken those stores
of energy laid nn within us—stores of which
many are unaware, so that they go through
life as poverty-stricken beings instead of
potential millionaires. As the Russian say-
ing has it, they are beggars sitting on bags
of gold.
H J. WOLFE.
“Going Native”
Beginning with John Wilson, the First
Fleeter, Australasia has had quite a num-
ber of “white blackfellows” and “pakeha
Maoris” —white men who have, from either
necessity or choice, “gone native.” Most
of them are either entirely forgotten or re-
membered only by some casual chance refer-
ence. Such are James Caddell, the English
sailor-boy who became a Maori chief and
led his adopted tribe in cannibal raids on
the sealers and bay whalers of the South
Island (M.L.) ; Germein, the kangaroo
hunter, who lived for years with the long-
extinct Tasmanian abos.; and George
Clarke, “the barber,” who spun to Sir
Thomas Mitchell such wonderful yarns about
the great Kindur River, away beyond the
Namoi. Those who returned to civilised
life were apt either to use the long, bow, like
"the Barber,” or to imitate the oyster, like
Edward Davis (Durarnboi), who spent 14
years with the Moreton Bay abos. and be-
came a mighty hunter and warrior, but who
used to say, on being asked about wild life.
"Go and live with the blacks and find out.”
A few of those who have thus leapt back
across the ages into the primitive life
have made, or had made for them, some
small niche in literature. William Buckley,
“the wild white man,” found in John Mor-
gan, of Hobart Town, a wordy and senten-
tious chronicler of his 30 years with the
Stone-Age abos. of Victoria. How much of
the resultant dulness is due to Buckley and
how much to his editor it is: no longer pos-
sible to determine. Maoriland has fared
better. Judge Maning’s “Old New Zealand”
>s a classic in its way.
Another book, fascinating from the sheer
stark savagery of the story that it has to
tell, is James Cowan's “Adventures of
Kimble Bent,” the deserter who joined the
Haii-haus of Taranaki in 1865. Bent
saw, from the Maori side, the last great
struggle between the old order and the new,
the vain effort of the Hau-haus to drive the
white men from the land. He was present
at the fight at Moturoa in 1869, and after
the battle he watched ten men of the Nga-
Rauru tribe cook and eat the fattest of
the slain white soldiers, the last cannibal
feast in Maoriland. He saw, too, the Matt-
hau warrior Tihirua tear out the heart
of a fallen foe and offer it as a sacrifice
to Uenuku, the war-god, using lucifer
matches to make the burnt-offering. But
there was nothing squeamish about Bent
himself, whose mother was a half-caste Red
Indian. Nor, if it comes to that, was there
about the Hau-haus’ pursuers. There is a
Maoriland parallel, on a larger scale, to
Kipling’s story of Crook O’Neil and the
head of Boh Da Thone, the Burmese
dacoit. Colonel Whitmore had,, in a moment
of excitement, promised to give £lO for
the head of each Hau-hau chief and £5 for
that of each common man brought in by the
“friendly .Maoris” under “Major Kemp”
(Kepa). The Wanganui men collected
heads in a chase through the bush, and
while Captain Porter was reporting to Whit-
more they entered the tent and emptied the
heads out on the floor. Like Stewart —‘the
Enoch Arden in real life who gave his name
to Stewart Island —Kimble Bent, sailor, sol-
dier, outlaw, slave to the Hau-haus, cart-
ridge-maker, canoe-carver, pa-builder and
medicine-rnan, ended his days amongst the
Maoris —in his last years a mild old man,!
who looked like a respectable shopkeeper. ,
DONLRAIN.
A Satchel of Books
While I Remember, by Stephen McKenna (Thorn-
ton, Butterworth). Though only 33 when the war
ended McKenna discloses himseif as, spiritually, at
least 60. He was reared “on the pure milk of late-;
Victorian Radicalism,” and it can still be traced in
a contempt of Jingo-Imperialism and a hatred of
England’s traditional Irish policies during his life
as a man of fashion and a successful novelist in
London. Then came the war, and this complacently-
correct young-old man lost his temper as badly as
any German professor. For the rest there are many
interesting judgments on politics, literature, music
and morals. Particularly morals. His adjectival
righteousness where moral issues are in question is
very British.
Max Beerbohm in Perspective, by Bohun Lynch
(Heinemann). A charmingly written study of the
English wit and caricaturist, it is not altogether a
revelation, because Beerbohm characteristically re-
fused to furnish biographical particulars; still it
gives a peep into an engaging and brilliant per-
sonality. It seems that Beerbohm was first detected
as a coming writer by Aubrey Beardsley, who rushed
to Henry Harland, then about to launch the Ykulow
BOoic. At Beardsley’s suggestion Beerbohm became
a contributor, and his first essay was. the dainty
“Defence of Cosmetics,” subsequently republished
under the title of “The Pervasion of Rouge.” After-
wards he wrote much more and developed the humor
and style which gave him a unique place among
English essayists:' His singular ability as a caricaturist
is dealt with in the second part of the book, and
the force 6f his work is demonstrated in some capital
plates. He never draws direct from life. He studies
his victims at close range several times, mentally
notes their peculiarities, and then draws them from
all aspects until he gets the pose that will be part
of the likeness. As regards media, he has never
taken kindly to the.pen. The pencil is his weapon,
and he has scored many a hit with a simple outline
touched up at salient points with light dabs of
water-color.
The Etchings of Charles Mergon, by Campbell
Dodgson (The Studio, Ltd.). A handsomely-pro-
duced volume that makes a fine centenary memorial
of an outstanding and potent personality in the his-
tory of etching. A pitiful life story, Meryon’s—the
illegitimate son of an English doctor and a French
opera dancer whose heritage was a touch of genius,
a touch of color-blindness and more than a touch of
insanity. It was his to produce masterly etchings
and get only a franc and a half to two francs for
proofs whibli were destined to change hands at
hundreds of, pounds after he, like his mother, had
died in a madhouse. In his monograph Campbell
Dodgson (Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the
British Museum) has nothing to tell of Meryon’s
career that has not already seen print, but he epito-
mises the main facts handily, gives a sane estimate
of the artist’s rank and offers useful comment
on all ids more important etchings. Nearly
50 plates, reproductions of originals in the fine col-
lection of the British Museum, go to the making of
an . imposing artistic volume. Meryon’s Tete de
chicn de la Xovveile-llollande, one of the gleanings
of- his naval days’ (1837-46), is not among them.
This is a study 6f a ding® that was something of a
pet on the corvette Le Rhin until he took an
untimely dive to death over the side. Australians
would have been interested to see how their warrigal
had fared in‘this etcher’s hands.

“Rae-akiaki”: It is probable that in the
near future Maoriland will not have to rely

“G.M.”: A while ago the electric light
failed in Chapel-street, Prahran, one Friday
night, and as customers bundled out of one
crowded shop they carried off as far as can

tised an extra bargain sale.

“Te Pana”: I was buying a dozen eggs
the othey day and noticed that the brown
were higher-priced than the white eggs. The
dealer explained that the glite will always
pay more for the colored fruit. What he
didn’t say was that soaking white eggs over
night in cold tea produced the favored tint,
which is not removed even in the boiling.
X2X ’: A few days ago the University
of Melbourne advertised for a pathologist.
The qualifications for the job are a degree
in medicine, special experience in pathology,
and some hospital practice. Hours, 10 a.m.

wage ! _ And now listen to the University
complaining that the private employer will
not pay graduates a decent salary !
Malua” (Samoa) : I lately had a dozen
new axe-handles fitted, all Australian wood,
and they are the first I have had that do not
fray on cocoanut splitting. I have used
dozens of American handles on this work,
and have always had to bind them with wire
to make them last any time, whereas, so far,
none of the Australian handles shows any
sign of wear, nor are any of them wire-
bound. The Yankee handle is better finished,
but the quality of the home-made is far
superior.

“0.K.”: In recent attacks on the tobacco
handling profiteer, the Age refrained from
putting blame on the retailer, though his
success in charging a little too much for
the goods when prices began to rise was
an incitement to manufacturers to go on
increasing their profits. But the public has
a , remedy in its own hands. A complaining
citizen who neglects the simple plan of
learning to do without is but as sounding
brass and a tinkling cymbal. Immoderate
smoking and spitting are two of Australia’s
pet vices. Why worry about tobacco cost-
ing too much when every extra penny an
ounce is only another reason why the suffer-
ing smoker should determine to suffer less?

“Baibrise”: Cosmo Newbery, aforetime
Government analyst at Melbourne, once con-
demned 5000 cases of China tea. It con-
tained coarse hair, fragments of bone and
other refuse. Every Chinese desires burial
in his native village. The bodies of those
dying a distance from home are, if funds
and other opportunities offer, enclosed in
coffins and packed with tea as a preserva-
tive. This tea is not wasted—which may
account for Newbery’s analysis. I saw at
Kobe and Yokohama hundreds of nearly-
nude coolies stirring tea which was being
dried to the curl in large metal vessels over
charcoal fires. Perspiration and grime from
their bodies dripped on the leaves. A ques-
tion for teetotallers is whether tea impreg-
nated with dead or alive Chow is better
than a mild wine from Australian vine-
yards.

“Percy Pawnticket”: Usually a board-and-
lodger doesn't think of asking for a receipt
from his landlady, and she never proffers
ope. The danger of this carelessness—to
the lodger, anyway—was shown in a recent
case in which Mrs. Hashtowers claimed over
£225 for board since 1936 from a horse-
owner, who declared that he was always
prosperous and had paid the lady regularly.
The magistrate had only the words of the
opposing parties to go upon, and in the
absence of documents Mrs. Hashto-wers got
her verdict.
* * *. *
“Sixenate”: A hole has been bored in
the N.S.W. Medical Practitioners Act by
an “eye specialist,” who successfully applied
for an injunction against a country P.M.
who had given a verdict against him under
the Act. The eye specialist has been in the
habit of calling himself “Dr.,” and in a
N.S.W. country town he was proceeded
against for illegally using that appellation
and fined £5O. The Full Court in Sydney
held the view, however, that the term “Dr.”
need not mean Doctor of Medicine,, and so
freely expressed its views early in the argu-
ment that counsel for the Crown practically
abandoned the case. So, apparently, the
tinkers will have to again get to work on
the Act.

“D.D.”: Coincidences? Here is my con-
tribution. My wife and I were born on
-Tuesday. We were married on Tuesday.
Each of our first four children arrived on
that day. Number five waited till Friday,
but six came along all right.
"Pat Bushie”: A constable was found
drinking on licensed premises after hours,
and was brought up before the superinten-
dent. "If you wanted a drink after hours,
why didn’t you ask the sergeant?” thundered
the super. “Because I only had sixpence,”
was the meek reply.
“Coot”: Barpinba, near ,Oolac (Vic.),
was originally Weering, but for some reason
it was found necessary to alter the name.
The local council appointed a committee of
three to deal with the matter, and on their
suggestion the new name was adopted. Most
of the other Bumbles thought it was an abo-
riginal word, but as a matter of fact it
was composed of the first syllable in the
names of the three committeemen: Barnard,
Pink and Bath.
“M.L.R.”: Governors who can’t make
ends meet on their salaries aren’t new, and
they didn’t always turn tail and run. When
the Belmores were in Sydney about 40 years
ago they found things “difficult,” seeing that
their family increased yearly. (I think it
reached double figures eventually.) Instead
of making a loud outcry they started a cab-
bage garden at the vice-regal country resi-
dence. and their vegetable carts were in
the city streets any Saturday morning.
“Caff” : Two Diggers on discharge bought
the wayside pub between here and the next
place ; but day after day went by and the
thirsty souls of the district were faced with
closed doors. At last someone appealed to
the solitary John Hop, who went out to
investigate. It was some time before he got
any response to his knocking, and when he
asked why the business was not being con-
ducted as usual, there came a voice from
within: “Blime. you don’t think Bill and me
bought this joint with our deferred for the
blanky public, do you? We bought it for
ourselves /”
“J.M.D.”: At the Sailors’ Home, Mel-
bourne, there is a tablet to commemorate
the bravery of a young sailor, William Mel-
rose McDonnell, in connection with the
wreck of the Admella (B. 2/3/’22). He
was a non-swimmer, but, seeing the plight
of the people on the wreck, he called for
volunteers, and with two companions went
out in a small boat. They rescued 22 from
what appeared to be certain death. One
rescued passenger, Hurtle Fisher, became;
prominent in ,S. Aus. public affairs many
years afterwards. McDonnell, who was my
uncle, received the medal of the Royal
Humane Society, and, I think, a bronze
medal from the Queen. One of his sons.
Angus, is Mayor of Northcote (Vic.), and
one of the few sane men leading the Labor
movement in Victoria.
The most graceful feature of the trial of
Colin Ross tor the Gun Alley murder in
Melbourne was the Argus’s acceptance of
the occasion as a fashionable function. The
dresses, hats and etceteras of the witnesses
were described in detail, making an effective
contrast to the grim features of an otherwise
distressing tragedy. For instance, “Miss
Olive Maddox. .. .was smartly dressed in a
frock of navy jersey silk, ornamented down
the side with designs in white. Her hat
was of navy silk, with ostrich feathers in
the same shade. She wore grey gloves and
a plain gold bangle.” Is this to be a custom?
If so it is only fair to let women know that
in the event of their being called as wit-
nesses on important trials their dressing-
will have the same attention that it gets on
Cup Day at Fleming-torn
“Hanno”: Not long ago I came across
the counterpart of “Sierra’s” ancient sailor-
man (B. 26/l/’22) who didn’t know the
name of the ship in which he had just fin-
ished a long voyage. An aged shellback was
admitted to a Melbourne hospital as the
result of a street accident, and when he came
to give the usual particulars about himself
he had no idea as to the name of the vessel
on which he was employed. All he knew
was that it was owned by the company that
“useter be ’Oward Smiths.” Subsequent in-
quiries showed that he had been working on
the steamer for five months. In the A.I.F.
there were men who did not know the bat-
talion to which they belonged, and I once
ran across a man who didn’t know either
his battalion or his brigade. Yet in civil life
lie was a wharf tally-clerk.
“Baarmutha”: At Windsor (N.S.W.)
there are still to be seen the remains of old
boiling-down works that were treating sheen
and cattle for their fat in the ’forties and
’fifties. They are on- Fitzgerald’s grant,
a property still owned _ by Miss Fitz-
gerald, of the Mudgee district, but occu-
pied by a later generation of those
Gospers who got the place on lease
from the grantees. The relics consist of
eight large iron boilers, which were cast at
P. N. Russell’s foundry in Sydney, and a big
iron steel-yard, which was used in weighing
th i casks of tallow before they were punted
down South Greek to the Hawkesburj\ where
they were re-loaded into coasters for Sydney.
The proprietor of that old boiling-down
establishment enndoyed from 60 to SO
Chinese to do all the work. Then a plague
broke out and the Chinks died by the dozen
and were buried two deep in big graves. Soon
after that the industry itself had a funeral.
“Overlander” on a oueer coincidence: — ;
Years ago when W. B. Hatton was managing
Yanda station, near Bourke (N.S.W.), a young horse
he was riding refused to prop when a calf he was
chasing turned, and Billy, a wild rider, hit it
between the ears with the handle of his stockwhip.
The animal fell, smashing Hatton’s left leg between
the ankle and the knee.. Scrambling- to its feet, the
horse made off, and Hatton crawled and dragged his-
broken leg about two miles before he could reach
the bridle. He managed to get on, and rode 12
miles to the homestead. When they got him to
Bourke (30 miles) mortification had set in, and the
leg had to be amputated. Years later his son, also
Billy, then about 15, was going for a drive with his
father (one of the horses was a foal of the mare
that figured in Hatton, senior’s, accident), when he
slipped in getting irto the buggy, and he was also
taken to Bourke with a leg so badly smashed that
it had to be amputated. The lad was game. While
lying on the table he turned to one of his friends
ard asked: “Do you like trotters?” “Why, yes.
Billv,” said the mystified friend. “Well, then,” said
young Billy, “you can have mine.”

- “1085”: The G-lenelg (S.A.) branch of
the U.A.O.D. has an honor roll of 150-odd
names in alphabetical order which ends up:
Webb.
Went.
West.
And so he did!
“Nik Sim”: I enter for the blue ribbon
a Brisbane matron who a few years ago
gave to Queensland five young Australians
within one year. The household was aug-
mented by triplets early in January, and
twins followed ere Santa Claus came round.
“Bendy” : During the construction of the
“Trans” railway I saw three navvies pool
£OO0 —their savings for perhaps two years.
Each tossed a coin—odd man to take the
lot. Two tails and a head turned up first
spin. The winner scooped up the £OOO
and immediately set out for civilisation.
Within three months he was back again—
stone, motherless broke and looking for a
job.
“Sir Spen”: There was a vengeful touch
about the death of Tom Cooper, the Ma
State’s champion axeman, the other day
at Pembroke, on the Hastings River
(N.S.W.). He, a brother and a mate who
were working in the big timber had just
finished their mid-day meal, when a limb
from a tall gum came like a bolt from the
blue. It was only a small branch, but it
landed on the back of Cooper’s neck and he
died almost instantly—aged but 35.
“Ducie” : There is a fine story of Gover-
nor Phillip giving Manly its name because
of the savages who nobly resented his going
there surfing or something; but is it abso-
lutely authentic? Among the first naval
officers to reach Australia was a Captain
Manly or Manley. Again, after whom was
Bankstown (N.S.W.) named? Sir Joseph,
of course. Was it? In the graveyard of St.
Thomas’s, Enfield, are the tombs of sundry
Bankses who were among the earliest settlers
out that way.
The young lady on the spot was telling
the story of a man-friend who had had his
nose smashed in a game of football. It
wasn’t till he met the girl of his heart that
he bothered about his ruined aquiline. Then
he consulted a specialist, who popped him
into hospital, clipped fragments off a rib and
built a new nose. “Well, well,” drawled
the brute, “the marvels of surgery! The
Creator only made a mouthpiece from man’s
rib, but the doctor can turn it into a nose!”
“Arbeep”: I’ll bet “Toby C.” (B. 23/2/’22)
that Jerry Tuite didn’t put up a plate-laying
record of 62 chains in hours with eight
men. Sixty chains would entail adzing,
laying out and placing 1881 sleepers, laying
198 40ft. rails, boring 7600 holes, driving
7600 dogspikes, placing 396 fishplates, in-
serting and screwing up 1568 fishbolts, to
say nothing of pulling the road to centre, and
gauging and shovel-packing or beater-pack-
ing the whole. If Jerry had the material
laid out on the job for him before he started
he could call it bedtime before he got a
third of the distance with three times the
men.
Commander G. Harold de P. Chance,
R.N., is the secretary of the North Austra-
lian White Settlement Association, which is
out to refute the Black Australia ideas of
Barwell. He belongs to a wealthy family of
glass-manufacturers in Birmingham (the
firm supplied the reflectors for the South
Head light). W r hen a boy his people hoped
to make a lawyer of him, but the youngster
showed his ideas on the subject by running
away to sea, so they put him into the Navy.
His first bo„t in Australia was, the old Kar-
rakatta. Subsequently he mar rod an
Aussie girl, then transferred to the R.A.N.,
and is now a confirmed Australian citizen.
■ “Journalist Jake”: The late James Bryce,
professor, statesman, plenipotentiary and
viscount, had many relations in Australia.
Chas. Young, of K.vneton (Vic.), now dead,
was an uncle on the maternal side, and C.
D. Young, who grows sheep near Goondi-
windi (Q.), is a cousin. Of other cousins
one is on the staff of Dalget.v’s in Brisbane
and another is the wife of 11. L. Simpson,
who chases Costs at Ipswich (Q.). Bryce
left a widow many years his junior, but no
family. One brother is in the House of
Commons, and used to be anathema to the
suffragists in pre-war days, though his
wife was one of them; and James Bryce
used to tell that once when his brother was
on a visit to Cairo, he gasped on reading
that a suffragist procession in London had
been headed by his own daughter on a milk-
white steed.
Apropos the N.S.W. Premier’s boast that
wherever one goes in his State new loan
works will be seen bounding over the land-
scape, and development jobs piled three deep,
there is always the exception of the Dubbo-
Werris Creek railway, a frequent starter
but one that never lasts out the course. It
was put on the list of works to be done out
of the last loan, and many other loans, but it.
has less luck than a deceased Chow. When
finished (after the second coming of Nebu-
chadnezzar) it will enable North. West and
South to trade with each other without send-
ing the goods round by Sydney—and that ex-
plains everything. As matters stand, any
invader or madman who dropped a bomb
on the ill-guarded Hawkesbury bridge could
cut Australia in two parts ;. and until that
railway is built Australia v'ill, for defence
and many other important purposes, be a
one-bridge continent.
“Ybned”: “Gregor” (B. 16/2/’22) is cor-
rect in saying there is not a plant in Aus-
tralia built to distil coal tar for the produc-
tion of dyes, etc., and he will continue to be
correct for a long while yet. I have been in
the coal-tar business seven years, and have
explored all our logical markets, i.e.. Java.
China. Siam, Malay States and India. We
have no chance in these against the German
in dyes; and with only our local market to
supply, the demand would not pay interest
on the amount invested in the plant. There
is an increasing demand for distilled tar for
road-making in Asia, and it can be increased
by proper representation; but to expect any
concern to put £40,000 into a plant to extract
the dyes, etc., as they do in Europe, is really
stupid. I believe not one ton of coal should
be burnt ashore, but that it should all be
made into coke, freeing the by-products for
use: but to manufacture dyes we want a
much greater home population, because we
have no chance with Germany in the open
market while our cost of production is what
it is.

City living conditions
For Every Country Home
Country life—farm life—are transformed
under the three-fold influence of Western
Electric Power and Light. A new plough, a
new harvester, or any similar machine, merely
operates on one particular job, and for a great
part of the year is laid aside in idleness.
Whereas the Western Electric Plant is the
most profitable and satisfying investment ever
offered the country dweller. It radiates comfort,
and contentment day and night, and earns its cost
at the same time. It is doing this for over
100,000 users at this very moment.
Western Electric Power and Light stands
alone among lighting plants because it is a
three service plant, protected against trouble,
and with over 50 years experience of electric
engineering behind it. Let us see what this
Go into any room in the house, on to
verandahs, at gateway, in stables, dairy or barn.
Press a switch and you have a bright, safe,
reliable electric light.
Washing day is an easy day, because women
folk can do the work with a Western Electric
Washing Machine and Electric Iron. Other ap-
pliances for daily use, are, an Electric Vacuum
Sweeper, Dish Washing Machine, Toaster,
Sewing Machine Motor and an Electric Fan.
Western Electric Power and Light enables these
modem household helps to be used because
its Battery is big and strong enough (288 ampere
hours) to carry a generous supply ot current.
This electric power can also be used for operating
the separator, churn, grindstone, etc.
The service which enables Western Electric
Power and Light to earn its cost comes from the
314 H.P. Kerosene Engine that is part of the
plant. Here you have ample power for driving
any machine with a high-grade outfit—air cooled,
throttle governed, and with positive fuel feed.

Allan Wilkie doffed Macbeth’s pink tresses
at Melbourne Palace on Saturday to indulge
in the simple oafishness of Bottom the
Weaver in a fairly satisfactory production
of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Wilkie
easily dominated the proceedings, and his
fellow-toilers in the tragedy of “Pyramus
and Thisby” were moved by his large and
lusty example to wring the utmost humor
out of the joke. The only drawback was
the flat falsetto and still flatter manner of
Flute (Hamilton Henry) in the part of
Thisby. William Lockhart, as Peter Quince,
was none the worse for a Polonius-like air
of petty importance, and the Starveling of
J. Plumpton Wilson was a whimsical
patriarch of the scarecrow family. Each did
his little bit in the performance before the
Duke of Athens, but the house rocked most
to the preposterous business of Wilkie pre-
paring himself for a comfortable pose as
a corpse. He was also good as the ass, and
he spent a weird night in a wood that looked
suspiciously like the Forest of Arden. Still,
there were compensations for a lack of pic-
turesque fancy in Titania’s haunt. One of
them was the lady herself (Pamela Travers),
a plump and comely nymph whose white
limbs twinkled through a small helping of
sea-green draperies. By comparison Leslie
Manners’s Oberon seemed to be perishing
from histrionic neglect. The little fairies
were always charming, but Miss Vera St.
John’s Puck was rather overgrown, and her
chortle at the misery of the love-lorn Demet-
rius and Lysander wasn’t always in the
right key. She was a gamin more than a
sprite. Roy Workman’s main shortage for
his parts is a lack of physique, wherefore
his Demetrius was a somewhat puny part-
ner for Helena, in which role Hilda Dor-
rington made a moderate debut. Probably
she was suffering from nervous restraint;
but, anyhow. Helena doesn’t give much scope
for acting. The ever-winsome Lorna Forbes,
as Hermia, found a sombre Athenian lover
in Robert Purdie, and stodgy Augustus
Neville (Theseus) discovered aii affinity in
Mona Duval as Hippolyta. But Allan
Wilkie’s robustious humor kept these
stained-glass Athenians in the background.
Act as they might, they always sounded like
supers. Next Saturday Wilkie begins to
wind up his season with six nights of
“Richard III.”

“A Night Out” completes its eleventh week
at Melbourne Majesty’s to-morrow night.
The advt. states “there’s a reason” for the
success, but The Bulletin won’t mention
his name for fear of making the other pro-
ducers jealous.

Louis Bennison is still asserting his
beautiful nature with lasso and pistol in
“Johnny Get Your Gun” at Melbourne
Royal. His method of weaning the bogus
Duke from his designs on the heroine’s mil-
lions is more forceful than is allowable
in Noo Yoik society, but Louis’s intentions
are so noble that he can even be forgiven
the awful cowboy uniform in which he subse-
quently restores a quantity of stolen railway
shares.

Nicola’s spread of illusions at Melbourne
King’s continues to lose most in effect
through want of showmanship. His settings
suggest the circus, and he doesn’t arrange
his feats to bring down the curtain in a spec-
tacular climax. He could have learnt much
in those directions from Dante and one or
two other magicians of the past; otherwise
the best of them couldn’t have taught him
much about his enthralling art, and he could
have taught all of them something.
“All the Winners” is finishing its mildly-
festive season at Melbourne Tivoli to-
morrow night; and the next entertainment,
which has moved up on padded feet, will
include Talbot O’Farrell, a miich-photo-
graphed personage in belltopper and monocle
who is said to have.out-doone Doone in songs
of Erin.

This week Hoyt’s De Luxe, Melbourne, is
unfolding the adventures of Miss Du Pont
as “The Rage of Paris.” The heroine, is a
celebrated dancer who drops her husband for
an old but renovated sweetheart, and then
pursues a career that lias become a classic
in celluloid literature. “Seeds of Vengeance,”
planted at the same house, are yielding a
rich cx'op of feuds
carried out in the
usual mountain
scenery. At the
Lyceum “The Soul
of a Woman” is
being inspected,
and the result is
regarded as a re-
velation. The son
of G e t - R i c h-
Quick Wallingford
is spending a few
nights at the
Majestic, and his
haughty hatred of
the methods that
made his parent
famous deals heavy
punishment to the
idea of inherited
criminality. The
moral perfection of
Wallingford, junior,
is demonstrated by
his Methodist tac-
tics in overcoming
his dad in a big
oil deal. This pic-
ture is the chief
item on the Majes-
t i c programme,
which would be

“Babes in the Wood” are still busy with
their anti-waste propaganda at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. The strictest count has
not been able to discover so much as a fig-
leaf too many. But Sydney isn’t discour-
aged : it rallies in battalions every night on
the off-chance of finding one mislaid. And
then !

“The Merry Widow” is out at grass for
two more nights at Sydney Royal; then the
sod falls upon her, and Gladys Moncrieff
does a turn-about and becomes Katinka of
the succulent “Racketty-Coo” notes. Gladys’s
widow has been an overpowering triumph ;
and though she is wearing rue over the
lady’s demise, she is thinking pleasantly of
an extra £80 a week that has been tacked on
to her new contract with the Firm.

Emelie Polini and Frank Harvey are still
changing their nationality and their clothes
five times every night at Sydney Criterion.
“My Lady’s Dress” isn’t much' of a play:
but as it serves very well to exhibit Miss
Polini’s qualities, it answers its purpose.

Not the least of the virtues of Musgrove
variety shows is that there is variety in them.
The newest amusement at Sydney Tivoli
is a clay-modelling item by a French pair,
Yost and Clady. In the deft hands of the
male partner the clay quickly assumes many
shapes, and to keep pace with his modelling
he fires “gags” in broken English at his clady
partner. Another newcomer whom this page
is quite willing to hear again is Nea Hal-
lett, a soprano balladist; Rickaby is still
on his beat, and Madeline Rossiter continues
to offer entertaining songs and graceful
dances.

A fascinating little movie usher is the
heroihe of Fanny Hurst’s story, “.Tust
Around the Corner,” starring at Sydney
Lyceum and Lyric. The usher has a mother
and a brother, and they all live happily to-
gether till the girleen develops a beau who
refuses to come home and meet mother.
Whereupon mother, of course, suspects his
intentions of being strictly dishonorable and
without benefit of clergy; and the dutiful
girl casts him oft' and develops another young
man, an honest mechanic on the basic wage,
and the final reel shows them in a home
that looks like a star advertisement for the
Millions Club’s easy terms. Crystal Palace
reels off India as seen through Edward
Wales’s eyes, and a story of honest endeavor
based on a purely dishonest intention on
the part of one “Honest Hutch.” At the
Empress and Majestic Dustin Farnum wades
through seas of blood in his pirate career, and
dances a hornpipe of death amid the severed
of his merry men. Finally, the “Devil
Within” is purged by the movie panacea,
Love. Katherine McDonald is raised from
cash-girl to star actress, and has one painted
hour as “The Beautiful Liar.” The yarn
is too weak to stand. The Haymarket,
Hoyt’s and Piccadilly run still another
shadow-show of India, this time registered
by the Duke of Connaught’s cinema ; and it
is pretty good.

The nectar of first emotions is not for
the town flapper-—she has lived them all in
pantomime, good and bad, at the movies.
She, has felt the blushing coyness of May-
flower in her CouUtry-girl romance; she
knows to a degree the warmth of Tropica’s
kiss after she has vamped Mayflower’s hus-
band and made him lose the 5.35 train to his
suburban Paradise. She knows all about
the East, its dancing girls, and the men with
burning eyes who live in caravans and scorch
the clothes off a girl’s back with their red-
hot gaze. No man has “anything on her,”
as she would tell you in her own barbarian
tongue. So for the past few weeks “The
Sheik” has swept in triumph from picture-
house to picture-house on. a stream of femi-
nine incense and four-and-fourpences. It
purports to be a peep into the domestic life
of the. Sahara, with a perfect-toothed, thrill-
ingly-handsome Arab chief as hero, some
dancing girls who go through all the acro-
batics of a hen enjoying a dust-bath, a sand-
hill shown from every angle, and a dashing
English girl named Diana, who is carried
off, with a Paris wardrobe, into the desert
home of the chief. Of course nothing hap-
pens, but the looker-on has the delirious
feeling that the worst might at any moment.
Think of the gamut of human emotions such
a picture. . .strikes ip the imagination
and down the spinal cord of Seventeen. If
ever she meets a sheik in like circumstances
she has Diana’s conduct right before her
mind’s eye for an example. Great educators,
the movies!

.Adelaide Royal is just getting on the rails
again with “Firefly.” West’s have a new
film idea in “Earthbound,” the story of a man
who was killed but stayed about on the
scene of his former life as a .shade. Won-
dergraph has “Sentimental Tommy,” with
Barrie’s death of the hero changed, of course,
to a happy ending. The jolly English
Pierrots have moved on to Broken Hill, and
the Humphrey Bishop Co. is having farewell
evenings at the Garden Theatre—the nights
are getting cold. Otherwise there is a curi-
ous rush on the occult. Horace Leaf is lec-
turing seriously on the Materialisation of
Ghosts, and at different theatres Paul, and
little Argus, and Leon are dabbling on the
verge of the supernatural.

Melbourne meets the Diligent Woman: —
At the Athenaeum Miss James has hung 145 of
her efforts in oil, water-color and pastel. .As you
might expect, they are an unequal gross. If the
artist stuck to portraiture, in which she shows
sound drawing, she would make a stronger appeal.
“A Digger” (No. 73) is about her best. The ex-
pression of eccentric humor on the face is admir-
ably suggested, and the color is good. “An Anzac”
(No. 140) is a well-observed study of an Australian
soldier, and there is character in No. 89, another
portrait. Those three canvases in oil are greater
in achievement than her pastel studies of two ladies,
which arc pretty but not exciting, though they
reveal some dexterity with the crayon. The water-
colors are, generally, mediocre; indeed, many of
them are distressing. But there is a promise of
better things.in “Evening, Harkaway,” and “Wharf
at Hobart,” which are painted with a sound sense
of color values.
* * * *
Of another lady and a paint-pot:—
Portsea gets another advertisement from the brush
of Miss Elsie Barlow - at the Blue Triangle room,
which is at 288 Bourke-street, in Melbourne. The
artist, who is a water-colorist, plays the usual varia-
tions on a palette of brown, blue and green, to de-
pict cliff, sea and vegetation in an amiable manner.
The result would be monotonous if her industry were
greater, but as she limits her studies to a little
over-emphasis, the effect is cheerful. Her greatest
defect is her Prussian-blue sea that frequently
over 30, and maintains a summery brightness without
cheapens an otherwise passable picture ; her main suit
is a treatment of clouds which shows finer observation
than is apparent elsewhere. The sky in “Beggs Beach”
(No. 8) and in “Evening” (No. 32) is delicately
handled: so it is in “Cattle Quarantine Station” (No.
29), though the rest of this picture is only moder-
ately attractive. Some snapshots of Bridport, Tas-
mania, are on about the same artistic level as the
Portsea sketches. The only difference is that Miss
Barlow has made a better selection, and in No. 54
has presented an avenue of trees that anybody might
be glad to. own.
TIVOLI THEATRE, SYDNEY.
The Two Rascals singing “If Hell is full of
wine and women, O Death where is thy
sting?"
“E.F.” is hoping for the best: —
Some of the latest purchases by Melbourne National
Gallery strike me as being likely to grow in favor
with the intelligent section of the passing crowd,
as well as in the estimation of connoisseurs, in the
same way as the small Corot which has so mightily
increased in market value since the trustees raised
a storm by paying 4000-odd guineas for it. “Artist”
(B. 23/2/’22) complains that the big Gainsborough
picture is a long way beneath this master’s standard ;
but I would call it a characteristic Gainsborough
portrait. The young fellow of the picture is a very
real soldier, the dog at his feet is equally real, and
the broad expanse of background is full of fresh
air with a smell of the sea in it. The picture, which
is in a splendid state of preservation, will improve
on acquaintance. I see nothing to complain of in
its size. It is not too big for its position on the end
wall of a gallery, where pictures mostly look lost.
Certainly it was not wasteful expenditure of money
on a name, such as there was in the case of a
faded brown Turner landscape, or a forbidding Corot
picture of a nude, stodgy young woman with a red
ribbon band in her hair and a red bead necklace.
This unlovely thing was bought on the strength of
the artist’s name, which, considering that Corot had
no reputation as a figure-painter, cannot give it
great value. The Gallery’s agent in London makes
absurd purchases at times; for instance, a set of
water-color freaks by William Blake, supposed to
illustrate Dante’s “Inferno,” but really illustrating
only the pretentious eccentricity of Blake. Neverthe-
less, the agent has his successes. Among recent
Gallery acquisitions are some that should be trea-
sured possessions when the Felton Bequest has served
100 years of usefulness. Orpen’s full-length portrait
of an old sport in riding rig, seated crosswise on
a chair in his den where every picture tells a tale
of slaughter, is a very forcible little thing. Like-
wise G. W. Philpot’s portrait of a boy, hanging next
to it. “Lullaby,” by J. H. Lorimer, is none the
less a strikingly clever picture because the subject
—a negro nurse watching a child in a cradle —
appeals to the sentiment of every suburban matron.
But why the room that contains sane, masterly
paintings of simple domestic interest should harbor
inexplicable ugliness like C. J. Holmes’s “Black
Hill Moss,” or William Gibb’s “The Temptation
of Christ,” is a. mystery beyond my fathoming. Nor
do I hear of any artist who can read the riddle of
these: cranky picture-purchases. What purpose do
they serve? Granted that many of the intelligible
pictures have cheap comedy-drama or hackneyed
melodrama subjects. The same objection applies to
many “old-master” paintings which have lived. Will
future ages worry over the enigma, of ugly, unac-
countable pictures which not one person in a thou-
sand troubles to look at to-day ?
** * *
John Hughes writes from London :
The “Sentimental Bloke” film, trade-shown in Lon-
don a year ago, has just been released for general
exhibition. The Times says it is “of unusual interest
and a creditable first attempt” ; and the rest of the
critics are satisfied. With Boyd Cable I saw it a
few nights ago at Hammersmith, where the Palais-de-
Danse fever rages, and it was being played to a big
and joyous house. Suburban London wasn’t as puzzled
by the “Digger” dialect as I had expected. The
cheaper seats found no terrors in “On the shick,”
“Bosker” and other Australianisms, and the elbow-
nudging in the donah’s ribs and other amatory
pleasantries were received with expert and hilarious
enthusiasm by blokes and others who do these things
any old Bank Holiday on the ’Eath. The East-ender,
too, hoists just the same signs when he is out for
trouble. The “Bloke,” well played by Arthur
Tauchert, is now being shown all over London,
and fastidious West-enders seem to be as pleased
with it as the'suburbanites of Hacton and ’Acknev.


1 HERE is no beauty unadorned and no excellence that woula
not become barbaric if it were not supported by* artifice: this remedies
the evil and improves the good. Nature scarcely ever gives us the
very best; for that we must have recourse to art .... every
kind of excellence needs some polish. — Gracian.

bids Fashion. “Suit
your silhouette to yourself and
your costume—it is the day of in-
dividuality !’’ Be natural, but be mind-
ful that a too-literal interpretation of
this advice is as ruinous to charm as are
the rigid lines of the over-corsetted fig-
ure. The unsupported or improperly
supported figure all too soon evidences
its neglect in unpleasing lines and sag-
ging tissues that treacherously add per-
ceptible years and ruin the possibilities
of becoming dress.
A/T ODERN corsetry is a subtle art in
- Lyj - which nothing has been left to
chance. _ The secret of Gossard artistry
lies deep in the experience of many years
of leadership. In the Gossard design-
ing rooms was originated and perfected
that recognized fundamental of today’s
corsetry—the creating of special models
to meet the varying needs of the differ-
ent types of figures.
1 'HERE S the tall, slender woman.
When she’s properly corsetted she
has that indolent, willowy charm that
makes an artist watch her. But wrongly
corsetted, she so easily loses that sinu-
ous grace and becomes angular, meagre,
stiffly thin. If you are tall and slender,
the special Gossards designed for you
will coax a bit here and supplement a
bit there and give you ideal proportions
with unbelievable comfort.
' 1 'HE short, slender woman, corsetted
-*■ as she ought to be, has the irresist-
ible appeal of the perfect miniature.
Wrongly corsetted —you think only of
her lack of inches.
NOTHING reveals stoutness quite so
much as ill proportioned
Violent contrast between too large bust,
too small waist and too large hips, adds
pounds to the appearance and makes
becoming dress impossible. Many wo-
men who are no longer slim endure the
discomfort of stiff, heavily boned, tell-
tale corsets because they do not realize
that there is an unbelievably more com-
fortable, dignified and becoming kind
of natural corsetry to be found in spe-
cial Gossard models that will subtract
pounds from their apparent weight and
make them slim-by-proportion.
AND so on through the other types:
the short heavy woman, the one
large below the waist and the opposite
type whose brassieres are her best
friends, the curved back, the short
waisted —there are special Gossards for
all that will accomplish real marvels of
improvement with an amazing pliability
that leaves the wearer unconscious of
support except for a comfortable feeling
of well-being. And then, of course,
ther.e’s the average figure which so many
of us approximate—but we are all decid-
edly better for a little clever assistance.
|’' ' * ■
YOU will find these original front lac-
ing corsets at the best stores where
carefully trained corsetieres will help
you seledt the models best suited to
Your first scientifically de-
signed, expertly chosen Gossard may
mean a total change in the way your
dressmaker looks at you —and in the
way- you look at yourself.
f I "'HE cost of Gossards is well within
the- price you would expect to pay
for such superior artistry and workfnan-
ship, and you may buy each garment
with the assurance that it will wear far
beyond the life of the average corset
and retain its original grace of outline
to the last day you put it on.
i
Gossard Brassieres, like Gossard
Corsets, are designed voith scientific
exactitude to fit the various types ofi
figures. They give the sustaining com-
fort of a perfect, natural support,
assure the trim firmness of youth and
are an unfailing protection against
the settled lines of maturity.

“Beamish”; Allan Wilkie’s new leading
lady, Hilda Dorrington, who claims suc-
cesses in “Anthony in Wonderland” and
other American plays unknown here, is one
of Alfred Dampier’s old-time stars. She
toured with him in “Robbery Under Arms,”
“The Bush King,” “Lynch Law” and vari-
ous bloodstained classics, and married
Hubert Lee, a member of the co. who has
since retired from the stage.
“Extra Turn”: Harry Musgrove finds,
like ’Arry Rickards did before him, that
it pays to bring out the big No. 1 stars
from England. They prove more profitable
than half-a-dozen “also-rans.” The latest to
s'gn up for the circuit is Malcolm Scott,
who, as a Dame impersonator, has held his
own in variety and pantomime in England
for 15 years or more. He is a brother of
Sir Percy, R.N.
“Lud”: “My Lady’s Dress,” now on view
at Sydney Criterion, took so long to get
to Australia it’s a wonder it hasn’t gone
right out of fashion. Originally done at
London Royalty in 1914, the beauteous
Gladys Cooper played the part in which far
better actress Emelie Polini is at present
shining, and Dennis Eadie (who ran the
show) had the Frank Harvey roles. Com-
ments have been made on the play’s resem-
blance to the other Polini vehicle, “Eyes of
Youth.” But the latter piece is really an
imitation of the former. It was staged in
Now York some time after “My Lady’s
Dress” had been seen there.
“Suds”: The fact that Gladys Moncrieff
lias signed another contract with the Tait-
Williamson Co. at a salary alleged to be
hovering on the verge of three figures is
inspiring other geniuses in the same employ
to put a higher price on their services. One
iittle lady, who is not absolutely indispen-
sable, asked for and received a good increase
when her contract was up for renewal, and
being on the point of travelling to another
capital she demanded and was smilingly
granted expenses for mamma. This gener-
osity, wirelessed to a more limelit personage,
encouraged him to suggest a fabulous sum
to keep him contented with his job. It
was a very fine bluff, but it didn’t come off.
The management said that it was pained
to discover that a gentleman regarded as
an actor was really a bushranger. There
was a postscript to the effect that “If Rob-
bery Under Arms” were ever revived lie
would be offered the principal part.
“B.”: The threatened appearance in Aus-
tralia of the Irish Players will give great
jo ; y to those who are interested in the Irish
Literary Theatre. The company’s leading
lady is Moire O’Neil, sister of Sara Allgood;
and “The White-headed Boy” is to be the
first offering. Other possibles are “Riders
to the Sea” and “The Playboy of the West-
ern World.” When first staged in the U.S.
the latter caused a riot among Irish-Ameri-
cans, but opposition to it died when it was
found to be not a foolish lampoon but a
sincere study of the national character.
“Hamfat”: The Victoria Theatre, New-
castle, has dropped into the rapidly-growing
list of houses in the Fullers’ hands, Dix
and Baker having parted with all rights, for,
it is said, £35,500. Percy Dix, one of the
original firm, died a few years ago. He
was a sort of advance-agent for the Fullers
all through. In the infant years of this
century he ran a circuit in the four big
towns of Maoriland and planted a taste for
vaudeville in the public; it was the Fullers,
when thev got going cheaply, who reaped
the harvest. Later, Dix with Baker started
at Newcastle, and had a hard battle for a
few years until the coal city grew to expect
its vaudeville. Now Fullers will do some
more harvesting.
“Billy Cann”: Recently a schoolboy was
brought up at the Children’s Court for steal-
ing cash from a Vic. suburban station. He
had stuck chewing-gum on the end of a
stick, poked it through the window and
drawn out the coin.. “Where did you get
that idea?” asked the Bench. “From the
pitchers, sir,” said the nipper.
“J.F.H.” (Lond.) : After a silence of some
years Pinero has weighed in with a full-
sized three-act play—the first since “The
Freaks” of war days. Owen Nares, the
handsomest actor on the London stage, is
making his first experiment in management
with its production, and is now superin-
tending rehearsals. Nares heads the men,
and Winifred Emery (Mrs. Cyril Maude)
the women. Pinero has enjoined strict sec-
recy, and all that has transpired is that
“through the story runs a vein of fantasy.”
“Paudh”: The Wellington (M.L.) ’Var-
sity students were producing Gilbert’s skit
on Hamlet in the college gymnasium the
other night, when, just as the audience was
beginning to yawn, the red baize background
suddenly collapsed, revealing two unwashed
windows and a lady prompter huddled on
a soap-box. It took that lady prompter
exactly 2-ssec. to reach the wings. Then
the front curtain came down with a run,
leaving Vryn Evans, the ’Varsity Irving, in
lonely sequestration before the footlights in
the skimpy attire of Hamlet. Vryn rose
mightily to the occasion. “Ladies and
gentlemen,” he shouted above the gleeful
howls of the thoroughly awakened audience,
“this is not an accident —I arranged it all
myself!”
“Nella”: I saw an accident similar to
that described in “Hamer’s” verse, “The
Rightful Heir” (P,. 23/3/’22). “Robbery
Under Arms” was making money for Dam-
pier at the Alec, in Melbourne, and Sir
Ferdinand Morringer (F. C. Appleton) was
bound to a rock in Terrible Hollow, while
Dan (Ned Holloway) taunted him and biffed
him on the jaw. “Take that!” thundered
Ned, and inadvertently knocked Appleton’s
wig into the footlights. Both experienced
mummers were flabbergasted for the moment,
but Trooner Maginnis relieved the tension
bv cheerfully remarking “Niv'r moind, Sir
Ferdinand —this Tumble Hollow’s a hair-
raisin’ spot, annyhow!”
“Hamfat” on histrionic petticoats :
“O’Ren” (B. 23/3/’22) maintains that women
were playing on the stage in the time of Jame 3 I.
I call in evidence Tom Nash, who, in “Pierce Penni-
less,” praised the English stage for not having, as
they had abroad, women actors; and Prynne, in
“THE MERRY WIDOW,” AT SYDNEY
ROYAL.
Phil Smith as Baron Popoff and Arthur
Stigant as Nisch.
“Histriomastix” expressed his horror at thei idea
of female players. He recanted after the de nth of
Charles 1., and in his “Defence of Stage Play#’
proposed that women’s parts should be ta' le n by
actresses, as man’s putting on of woman’s apparel
was not warranted by Scripture. That was tl e Puri-
tans’ original objection to the stage; but 1 ’rynne’s
new suggestion did not please them any better „ That
apart, he would hardly have proposed a nytjhing
already in existence. In a marginal note t i “flis-
triomastix” he said: “Some French women, ir Mon-
sters, rather, in.... 1629 attempted to act a French
play at a playhouse in Blaekfriars —an ir jpudetrtt,
shameful, unwomanish, graceless, if not a rc sire
whorish attempt.” In another account (in a letter
to Bishop Laud) it was mentioned that thes<* women
were “hissed, hooted and pippin-pelted.” A French
co. that played in London in 1635 had no women
members —no doubt a sop to English prudery, for
the actress was well-established in Europe then, and
the fact that Pepys mentions hearing of a woman
player as of a curiosity shows that, even well in
the ’sixties, women were rather rare on the stage.
“Hamfat”: An old Wirths’ Circus per-
former, Will Rogers, is the star of the newly-
arrived American film “Honest Hutch’’; and
in a part that does not require “stunts” he
shows up well.
. “Digger-Strorat”: Tommy Foster, so long
with Julius of the Superb Legs, was the stage
manager for the whole Australian tour of
John O’Hara, and at the finish John gave him
a gold chain and the members of the co.
handed him a most extravagant-looking cash-
order for a dress-suit. So, though no mana-
ger may be a hero to his ballet, he can
evidently be something like it to a dramatic
co.
“O. Blin”; One Chauncey Ashford, who
played a large Semitic lago to Dan Barry’s
Othello in Ballarat and thereabouts, was
the only one in the company who ventured
to jest occasionally
at the expense of
the star. At the
final rehearsal on
the night before
the opening of the
tragedy, Ashford
thought Barry’s
conception very
crude in places, but
had no opportunity
to deliver a criti-
cism until, at the
end, the heart-
broken nigger
buries his head in
li i s hands an d
moans; “The pity
of it, Iago! The
pity of it!” At
this Ashford leant
over and sai d,
“Never mind, Dan.
You’ll probably do
better to-morrow
night.’’ Accounts
vary as to the
sequel. Some say
Barry took the re-
mark with a laugh.
Others declare
that Ashford never
stopped running
until he reached
the next town.
“A Night Out,” at Tier
Majesty's, Melbourne.
Field Fisher as
Boulton.
“T.R.H.”: “J.F.11.” (B. 16/3/’22) is
quite right in thinking that Edward Ledger
clid not make his riches out of the theatrical
Era. He landed one big sum by buying and
quickly selling Manchester Ship Canal shares
and another by speculating heavily in sew-
ing cotton when the Coats firm formed the
combine.
“Stargazer”: It was at the old Alec
(Melb.). Ned Holloway was the bold, bad,
black-browed rascal, and a trim young Aus-
tralian actor was the hero. Driven to fury
by the conduct of the subordinate villain in
trying to tie his beloved to the bench of a
mill preliminary to dissecting her with a
sft., buck-toothed circular-saw, the hero
drew his revolver, and firing from his appa-
rently helplesp position, tied to the butt of
a tree, he shot the bad devil through the
head. Shocked silence for a few moments ;
then an indignant voice in the gallery de-
manded: “What d’you do that for? Now
there isn’t a decent actor left!”
“Faree”: What recent play would you
say was the most un-French and generally
unlikely to have a Parisian success? “Peg
o’ My Heart”? A reasonable guess; and
yet “Peg,”, skilfully adapted, has been scor-
ing heavily in Paris, played .by a company
entirely French.
“T. 0.1.”: If, as “L.H.P.” asserts, W. G-
Wills didn’t write “Cromwell,” Tussaud
makes the mistake. I merely quoted him.
But as Tussaud made the lay figure which
was used in the piece, it is strange that he
should so err.
“T.W.”: Bass-baritone W. A. Peterkin,
who very quickly sang himself into Aus-
tralian popularity while supporting tenor
Edward Lloyd on a tour which collapsed in
the middle, is now comfortably installed in
a Government job in London —he picked it
up in the late stages of the big European
discord. Peterkin was so well liked when
he came with Lloyd that the Taits got him to
stay on for Ada Crossley’s iirst return to
her native land, sending him out with Scherek
and one or two other local musicians to fill
the intervening month or two with country-
warbles. He went on to S’Africa with
Crossley, and got to Britain well in pocket
from what he says was his most profitable
year.
“De Oriel”: I think some of these show-
men must have been politicians once. When
a hypnotist was billed in Panmure (Vic.)
a stranger came into the town and declared
that the professor had his son under the
influence, causing the boy to eat candles
and act like a monkey. The newcomer fur-
ther proclaimed his intention of going to
the show that night and dealing with the
entertainer. All Panmure went along to
see the fun—and found the angry parent
playing the overture.
“T.W.”: “Mon homme,” the vignette of
the Parisian underworld which supplies a
fleeting tragedy note in the Frolics show in
Melbourne, is built on a wonderful bit of
acting and singing at the Casino de Paris by
Mistinguett, now as big a favorite with the
boulevarde multitude as Gaby Deslys used to
be, and with much sounder reason, mis-
tinguett tells all about her pet apache with
a note of restrained passion that contrasts
mightily with the torn-to-shreds emotion of
her English copyists. A few moments after
her poignant b,t of sentiment, this most ver-
satile of all revueists is on tb» stage again
beautifully caparisoned in white plumage
and giving a delicious dance characterisa-
tion of a thoroughbred horse, with Harry
Pi leer, Gaby’s former stage partner, as the
rider.
“P.P.”: The “farmers and farm workers”
who are being imported under the immigra-
tion scheme include a few musicians. Un-
informed officials in London have told these
people (so they say) that, as in this wild
new country the arts have naturally re-
mained uncultivated, there is illimitable
scope for people who make musical noises.
As a matter of fact the Musicians’ Union —
through which the bulk of the available
work passes nowadays—is hard put to it
to keep its members employed; and it charges
an admission fee of £2O. One of these re-
cently-arrived musicians, by the way, came
to Australia because his wife is consump-
tive.
“Lud”: According to the cables that live
showman Charles B. Cochran, whose latest
London revue, “Mayfair and Montmartre,”
has been unanimously cut up by the critics,
is going to attempt the impossible. He
says that in future he intends to sell all his
seats on the first night, so that the public
alone shall be the judge of the entertain-
ment. It can’t be done. No manager in
England (or anywhere else, for that matter*
can afford to sell his house out to the public.
Where would he put his host of friends?
“Norbell” : The critics are not all in the
city. Eight years ago I toured with Philip
Lyttons co. “The Man They Could Not
Hang” was our long suit, and the weird
horror drew the backblocks better than
“Hamlet.” I was “The Man” of the piece,
and hated myself every time I went on the
scaffold. After the show in Mudgee 1 heard
one of our patrons commenting on our day-
bill posted in the bar. “Urn! ‘The Man
They Couldn’t Hang,’” he mused. "Cripes,
if ’e was anything like the bloke to-night,
I’d ’ve ’anged ’im orright. Or shot him,”
he added thoughtfully.
“Stargazer”: The Viviens were giving
them “East Lynne,” and having in mind the
lamentable lack of pence in the town and
district, the management had resolved to
accept payment in kind. You could take
your wile into the front seats for a bag of
cliaff. Pumpkins were accepted at the door.
Then came a large, red agriculturist, with
his small, brown wife and a freckled son of
15, and the huge cocky had not the where-
withal. Being blocked by the doorkeeper,
he said: “Its all right, son. You know tnat
dead horse in my home paddock? Well,
let me and the missus and the boy in and
the hide’s yours!” The Bugle in its next
issue reported: “Patrons turned away.” The
large farmer and his connections were the
rejects.
“Hamfat”: Tinville Elat was given an
unusual performance recently. Bunkum, who
managed the travelling dramatic show,
quarrelled with his wife, who played leads
to him, and she refused to go on. He hastily
rehearsed another woman in the part, and
the curtain went up as usual. When the
time came for Bunkum to embrace the
heroine an avalanche of indignant actress fell
on the stage. Bunkum was pulled back-
wards by the hair and sent sprawling and
the terrified understudy fled shrieking. Then,
cornering him in the set-stage room, the
wrathful lady delighted, the audience by giv-
ing Bunkum a brief lecture on his marital
shortcomings before she turned to the
“house” and announced that she herself
would take up the part of the shrinking
Violet from that point.
“Orb”: The Alfred Dampier Co. on one
of our tours didn’t carry a property skull,
and at Townsville (N.Q.) a beautifully
white specimen, with the lower jaw attached
by brass springs, was borrowed from a
friendly M.D. When the time came for
Hamlet to throw down the skull Dampier
was afraid of damaging the doctor’s pro-
perty, so he carefully handed it to the sex-
ton, at the same time giving the usual stress
to the line, “And smelt so? Pah!” Our
comedian, for w T hom Shakspeare had no
terrors, accepted the skull, sniffed at it sus-
piciously, and, as he waggled poor Yorick’s
jaw up and down like a ventriloquist’s
dummy, remarked, “ ’E does ’um a bit, don’t
’e?”
THE ELOPEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a lowering little bloke—
I found him seated at the bar —
Who into dreadful language broke,
And fiercely cursed things as they are;
With vigor and most fluently
He cursed them as they were, and he
Next cursed them as they soon would be.
He was a manager, he said,
Of high-class shows. Upon his soul,
His leading lady had just fled.
And left him in a blinkin’ hole.
Hard on the bar his fist he’d bump,
And with a devastating thump
He’d curse performers in the lump.
“They’ll ruin me!” he groaned. “She fled
Without a nod or ‘if you please,’ ”
He had not told me, perhaps, he said,
His co. comprised performing fleas.
Last night his leading lady had
Decamped, the blighter, with a lad—
“A scrubby tenor, sir, by gad!”

If it were not that John Wren’s expen-
sive Duuwil does better under the welter scale than
in ordinary handicaps his gallop in the Rydalniere
Mile at Kosfehill on Saturday could be counted a
conspicuously good Doncaster trial. Carrying lOst.
he beat a fair field home with a fine finishing run.
The Hordern-owned Kennepil, the best of the Kenil-
worths now racing, was only a head away. He will
do better later over a longer journey. In fact, if he
trains on, Kennepil should figure in the argument
over the Sydney Cup. Dunwil is unloading over 2st.
in the Doncaster. He was backed by Wren for a
hatfhl in last Epsom, and after starting badly settled
everything but Beauford.
Old Tom Payten’s son, the youngest of the Rand-
wick trainers, "turned out a couple of winners—the
Woorak filly Wolverine for Colin Stephen, chairman
of the A.J.C. ; and Thoughtful, a Piquet gelding, for-
merly addicted to winning picnic races, for Pat
Osborne. The young Wooraks have been doing well
this season, and though Wolverine may not be so
hasty as Salrak and Soorak she is certainly the
fastest lady in the family. Thoughtful won the 10-
furlong Club Handicap in good style, coming from a
long Way behind and showing the way back to a
smart field, including Syce Knight, Royal Alwvne,
Kashmir, White Phast and Booster. Some of these
were hardly ready. They will be in better shape
by Easter. Syce Knight, though backward, looked
well and surprised his connections by only missing
by a head.
The fact that three of Tregsady’s family scored
did not make the Thompson Brothers any more
resigned to the stallion’s tragic death lgst week.
They were Dornoch, Tressady* Queen (now four years
old, and the best of her year at two) and Theory,
a sister to the Queen from Formula. All three won
easily from a fairly hot lot. Tressady sired a mixed
collection, but only one that was really first-rate —
Thana, and she was as honest as horseflesh can be.
Tressady Queen was an' exceptional youngster. If
trainer Fred. Williams can manage to keep in repair
the doubtful knee she is afflicted with then another
Tressady will be counted among the best. She is a
sprinter of exceptional brilliancy.
“Wondah” : At a recent Yic. north-country
meeting a wire-whiskered son of the soil asked defer-
entially of a smart city fielder what odds he was
giving about Whitenings. “Fifteens,” was the reply.
Hayseed laboriously dug up a fiver in support of
the horse, and, later, piled another on top of it.
White wings won, after a painfully slow race. While
paying over the visitor asked irritably: “What made
you back the dam’ brute? He belongs to me.”
"Well,” drawled the simple ' creature, “I own the
other four starters.”

None of the favorites were placed in that
greatest of all sporting gambles, the Liverpool
Grand National, last Friday. Southampton fell at
the first, fence, which is a plain brush affair, and
Shaun SJpadah, one of the safest jumpers that ever
came out of Ireland, at the first open ditch. Shaun
Spadah was ridden by F. B. Rees, who is the finest
cross-country horseman in England to-day. L. B.
Rees (a brother of F. 8.) piloted the winner, Music
Hall. Drifter and Taffytus (the latter a 66 to 1
chance) were second and third respectively. Clash-
ing Arms, the third favorite, who probably had the
services of the amateur Harry Brown, was nowhere.
* * * *
“Jim Carew” : As an instance of the
struggle Ike often has to earn his wife’s diamonds
two owners arrived on a Sydney suburban course a
few days ago and started backing a certain horse.
If, constituted the only opposition to a prad which
they jointly ’ owned ; and after they had piled on
about £lOO apiece in fivers, their animal retreated
to B’s and the other was made a firm favorite by
the watchful multitude. At the last minute a friend
invested '£looo on their horse at starting price
in. town. ‘He 'scored ..easily, while the representatives
of Israel who had been lured into laying against
him uttered wild Yiddish imprecations.

On Saturday. gave Oxford the
worst linking in the history of the inter-’Varsitv
athletic contests: the Dark Blue team managed to
take only . one event to the other’s nine. When
the Rhodes scholars began to make their influence
felt in 1907, Oxford downed Cambridge by 84 to
14; but in all previous events the pegging was
pretty level, and there have been several draws. The
Cantabs’ win is the more meritorious this year, as
several S’Africans and Australians with biggish repu-
tations on the tracks are still up at the rival
establishment.

Domingo, the Chinese-looking little Fili-
pino, who, if he could fight as well as he skips,
would be Jimmy Wilde’s master, met Boucher, the
Queensland champion flyweight at Sydney Hippodrome
on Monday night. The fight ended in a curious
why. Domingo, who was doing- well at the time,
hit Boucher twice in the 17th well after the bell
had given him the office to cease fire. The thing
was so flagrant that the referee had to disqualify
him; and yet lie is one of the fairest little fighters
that has visited these shores.
The big London papers are taking Albert
Lloyd more seriously than anyone ever did in his
native State. Some of them gave over a column
to an analysis of his scrap with old Dick Smith
who would find it hard to get a match here and
impossible in the if.S. The big N. S. Welshman is
described as a stylist and a crafty ring-general, and
Smith’s victory was hailed as the greatest event of
an honorable career. It is doubtful if either of
the Australian heavies who are now being boomed
oveiseas could have gone five rounds with Les Darcy
at his best.
» * * •
Jamito and Jerry Sullivan (who has had
to leave the bantam class to get matches) drew a
big crowd to Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night.
The fight was full of interest, partly owing to
the lack of brotherly feeling which exists between
the pair. In the eighth round Sullivan acciden-
tally hit the chrome-hued one low. Jamito took nine
seconds on the floor and then hung on to the ropes
while Sullivan stood inactive in the middle of the
ring. Ordered to box on Sullivan set about the
penetration of Salvino’s smother, and the session
ended in futility. In the respite before the 17th
Jamito had another bit of bad luck, some collodion
getting in one of his eyes. He refused to leave
his corner, and only bounded forth in a state of
obvious exasperation when the master of ceremonies
began counting him out where he sat. Although
Sullivan took the 20th by a wide margin the
Filipino got the decision—a tribute to his remark-
able pertinacity. A biased section hooted the
decision.
* * * *
Stanley Mcßride, the Yankee feather,
who met Packy McFarlane at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night, is a long-bodied, brief-legged lad
with some good strokes and a tendency towards
flashness. His low, straight left to the stomach
scored every time, the Newcastle youth being wholly
concerned, apparently, to guard his jaw. Another
weapon of offence upon which he places reliance is
his tongue. A fair proportion of the 1922 vintage
of imported pugs is indulging in this habit, which
was supposed to have got its quietus in Australia
after the Burns-Johnson fracas. The features of the
fight up to the end of the 19th round were the aggres-
siveness of the Australian and the wary methods of
the American. The latter’s chief object seemed to
be to i-each the vicinity of his corner in time to drop
into the chair the second the gong went; and to that
end he would often start galloping backwards 10
or 15 seconds too early, as his upward glances
at the clock must have told him. In the 20th round
both performers cut loose, and Mcßride half punched,
half pushed the wearied Newcastle youth to the
boards. Rising .too soon McFarlane was handed the
punishment he had asked for by his rashness, and at
the end of the round was as near out as not to
matter. Mcßride the winner. Had he kept his
head McFarlane might have repeated the victory
which he gained over this opponent up north a month
ago.

S. Aus. tennis enjoyed its job this year
of taking on N.S.W. and Vic. at the same time.
Adelaide has not lately produced champions, except
R. V. Thomas, now playing against it; but there is
a big crowd just below that grade, and it was
spread out into two teams. Patterson and O’Hara
Wood (Vic.) were too good for the opposition, and
made that match a win by 14 rubbers to 7: but
the moderate N.S.W. four, Rice and Thomas, Jordan
and Watson, just lost by 7 to 5. Nearly all the
visitors stayed on for the local championships. Wood
and Patterson h. a d
some hard fights, and
said pleasant things
about several Adelaide
men—Rowe, who ran
Patterson to a five-set
match; Stuart, a new-
comer of great pro-
mise ; and the tem-
pestuous G. M. Hone
(son of Dr. Frank
Hone, a doubles cham-
pion of long ago), who
has possibly the’fastest
service in Australia.
N.S.W. did not send
over a ladies’ team,
but the Vic. four,
headed by Miss Boyd
and Mrs. Lister, were
much too good for the
Adelaide women.
PAT O’HARA
WOOD , one of
Australia’s tennis
representatives.
J. Sidebottom, on a 7-h.p. Excelsior, re-
cently left Goulburn (N.S.W.) at 10.30 a.m. and
reached Sydney at 1.38 p.m. His time for the 133
miles beats the record previously held by J. Miles
by ;m hour all but five minutes.
At Sydney Domain Baths last week
Beaurepaire added the N.S.W. mile championship and
new State figures to his already extensive collection.
His 23min. 49 2-ssec. was 12sec. faster than W.
Longworth’s previous Australian best, put up in
the same enclosure in 1911.

One of Australia’s promising swimmers is
C. Stuart, of Sydney, a 15-year-old, who lifted the
Spit Club’s junior 100yds. championship on Satur-
day in 62 3-ssec-. He has already won a shoal of
championships, including- ihe Northern Suburbs’
junior 100yds. title. Ettie Robertson, the Sydney
Club’s 14-year-old wonder, in her first 440yds. race
annexed the Shepherd Trophy in 7min. 38sec., win-
ning bv 2yds. from the honor mark.

“Te W fra re”: Strange how water-hating
animals take a dip at times. I have seen a cat
swim across a fairly broad river. Certainly there
was a dog behind her, and Pussy and Ponto had a
scrap in mid-stream. I have also seen a hare,
undriven, calmly swim 50yds. across a salt lake,
and a porcupine (echidna), which apparently
nothing short of a brick wall or wire-netted fence
will stop, did a quarter-mile stunt across an estuary.
Brer Rabbit, too, when moved by strong reasons to
change his address, thinks nothing of a iairly-long
swim. I have also, occasionally, seen black- and
tiger-snakes negotiating salt water, the former
probably intent on eel, and the latter while leaving
a small island for the mainland. The goanria
(monitor lizard), too, is quite at home in both fresh
and salt water, and is often to be seen in rush-
encircled dams looking for reed-warblers’ nestlings,
eels and frogs. Although it is by no means to her
liking, the domestic hen occasionally takes to the
water, and with puffed-out plumage floats gracefully
thereon, like a feathered Annette Kellerman. The
fine, close down next her skin keeps her body per-
fectly dry.

Iv. Schneider, of Xavier College, seems to
be the champion schoolboy cricketer in Melbourne. Last
year, in his first season,
lie took 31 wickets for
347, at an average of 11 1.
performing the hat trick
against Wesley and Mel-
bourne Grammar. In nine
innings he made 246 (high-
est score 85) ; average
30.7. This year he pro-
mises to finish with an
even better record. In
three knocks he has regis-
tered 195, including a bril-
liant 124 against Geelong
College, lie also captured
six of the same school for
27, and his tally the other-
day against Scotch was 8
for 80 in the first innings
and 2 for 55 in the second
Schneider is a slow leg-
break bowler, and is Pel-
lew-like in the field. Pick-
ing up and hurling in with
the one action, he fre-
quently throws the wicket
down
CHRIS KIERNAN,
of Fitzroy.
The S’African athletes left Sydney for
Hobart on Tuesday, thus defeating Kaltenbrun’s
scheme of putting up an Australian and, mayhap,
a world’s record for one hour’s unpaced cycling.
The Australian attempt would have been simple of
achievement: there is no record of any sort in
existence here. The S’African one, which is Kalten-
brun’s, is '25 miles 980 yards.

One of the most interesting sculling con-
tests on record has been arranged to transpire shortly
on the Parramatta, the parties being Billy McDevitt,
Major Godse.ll and E. J. West. Each man is plank-
ing down £lob, the winner to take the lot.
N.S.W. Rugby Union enthusiasts’ visions
of a return of public interest in their code have
been shattered by the cable announcement that the
French team is not to visit Australia this year. An
effect will be to drive some more promising players
into the League ranks
“Sammal”: When the' Vic. cricketers who
went West recently refused to play at Kalgoorlie on
Sunday the Methodist Conference of S. Aus. sent a
telegram to Mayne congratulating him on his rebuke
to the ungodly! The good men didn’t know—how
could they V —that Colonial Secretary Broun had
refused to" allow gate-money to be charged on that
day.

In Sydney grade cricket on Saturday
Moyes, the ex-South Australian, created a N.S.W.
speed-record by banging up 218 at the rate of 24
runs per minute. He was appearing for Gordon
against Central Cumberland. The Chatswood Oval is
on the small side, and 42 of his runs were from
sixers. Bardsley, of Glebe, got a double century,
also —chiefly by big cover-drives and cuts. He
reached the boundary 29 times and landed over it
thrice. Mosman ran up one short of 400 for 9
wickets against ’Varsity (Chapman 79, Trennery 44
and Rowland 94). Waverley (8 for 314) gave Norths
an afternoon’s leather-hunting. Dwyer (92), Caswell
(80), Kippax (55) and Forssberg (42) treated the
Shore attack with scorn. The best Norths can
expect is a draw. The Sydney-Balmain struggle is
at an interesting stage. Sydney got 171. Dr. Camp-
ling’s slows secured 6 for 61, while Ironmonger’s 3
cost 67. The Balmainiacs have lost McCoy and
Thomas for 79 and Love (42) is n.o. Manly com-
piled 151 v. St. George, to which the response was
98 for 8. Fox captured 6 Villagers for 63, and Bubb
the same number of Botanists for 30. M. A. Noble,
the Paddington skipper, Secured 6 Western Suburbs’
wickets for 12 runs apiece. McKew (49), Wests’
captain, was the onlv one to make a stand. The
side was out for 172. Marrickville stayed in all
the afternoon against Randwick and put together 364
for 6 wickets. Steele (148 n. 0.) and J. D. Scott
(69). in partnership, produced lively cricket. Glebe
started badly against Petersham, losing 5 for 13.
Then Bardsley (210 n. 0.) arrived, and the last 5
wickets produced 355. Everett (3 for 20), Long
• (3 for 103) and Campbell (3 for 42) were Pete’s
star bowlers.
M.L.’s inter-island cricket match was a
tame affair this year. Souths laboriously compiled
169 and 256, occasional gleams being supplied by
Alloo, Blunt (they both reached their half-centuries),
Galland and Sandman. North’s reply was 244
and 5 for 183. Tliddleston, the local Trumper,
secured a masterly 68, and Barclay made 67 n.o. All-
cott, of Hawkes Bay, took 9 wickets for 118, and
Carlton (South) did well to get 6 for 106, consider-
ing he was overbowled.
Souths deserve first mention for their spec-
tacular defeat of Hawthorn-East in Melbourne District
cricket on Saturday. Opening with 4 for 81, they
knocked off with 8 for 398, winning by the heavy
majority of 2 wickets and'2o2 runs. Park (114) and
Woodful (84) made a great stand. Subsequently
Kenny and Purvis became busy, Kenny going for
55 while Purvis carried out his bat for 90. The
only cheering circumstance from the enemy’s point
of view was the smart wicket-keeping of Wootton,
who stumped four. As expected, Carlton lost to
’Wood —though the margin was but 76. Ryder,
bowling witn all his old pace and keeping a good
length, took 7 for 35. Thanks to the dogged work
of Ponsford (64) and Ellis (38), Saints managed to
snatch a game from P’ran by 15. But the bowling
of Wallace (7 for 69) looked like demoralising the
opposition at times. Melbourne, who declared with
7 for 200, just three ahead of University on the first
hits, sent in the students again. However, the
latter treated the Melbourne bowling with con-
tumely, and at the bell the board read 3 for 165.
’Roy were 89 to the good against North. The
best hand in North’s innings w r as Caddy’s 28. Wood-
ford stumped four and caught one, and Lansdowne
finished with the nice bowling average of 7. for 31.
The Essendon v. Northcote disturbance ended in a
tie —215 each. The result of these matches leaves
’Roy, ’Wood, P’ran and Carlton in that order to play
off in the semi-finals commencing next Saturday.
O’Keeffe failed signally in the only chance
he had with a N.S.W. XI. He was in the team
which went to Toowoomba (Q.) last season. A local
bowler named McKenna outed the Welshmen for
30. O’Keeffe’Q recent records have made the Banana-
landers prouder of that performance than before;
and the other day McKenna was presented with a
gold plate and pedestal containing the ball with
which the damage was done.
A police magistrate in Adelaide has ruled
that cricket in a public thoroughfare is not neces-
sarily an offence. Three brothers who had business
in the East End market beguiled an interval with
a knock-up on the footpath, with a bit of packing-
case for a bat. Their lawyer urged that the game
was not a “common danger or annoyance,” and the
Court was with him; “the mere playing of a game
in the streets does not constitute an offence.”
“Centurion” : “R.P.” (B. 9/3,/’22) asks
if a batsman can be out l.b.w. to a left-hander
bowling round the wicket, not breaking either way.
It is most uidikely that a left-hander, bowling well
out, with a round-arm action, could bowl a ball
which would pitch on and hit the wicket without
turning. But a left-hander w'ith a high action,
bowling close on the stumps, could do it. P. Vaile.
formerly of M.L., who specialises on the dynamics of
cricket, tennis and golf, has proved that such a
happening is possible—proved it to his own satis-
faction and to that of most people not obsessed with
the old theory.

Seven started in Sydney R.P.A. Yacht
Club’s closing race of the season. Frank Albert’s
big green-painted Rawhiti, piloted by Arthur Marks,
won off the honor-mark, beating the Logan-built
Bona (Len Patrick), by 3;}min. Bona’s allowance
was smin. Oenonc, the limit vessel, lost 17min.
at the fall of the flag and was never in the hunt.
It was Rawhiti’s fourth win in 15 starts. The
cruisers’ race under the same bunting was taken
by Andrew Wilson’s Eu-na-mara 11., smin. (owner
up)—her second offence this season.
“De Oriel” : I saw this in the Gippsland
(Vic.) train. Two card-robbers were playing euchre
with a young fellow from Warragul, when the lat-
ter looked at one hand and remarked: “I’d like to
play poker with these.” He was taken up, and when
the betting reached £9 he showed three aces and
two kings. One spieler had four sevens. “Bad
luck,” said the the Warragul “and I had
those cards three times in four deals.”
* * » *
“90S”; Tell “Pat Bushie,” who saw three
routine flushes in the one night (B. 9/3/’22), that he
should be more careful of the company he keeps.
The routine that was dealt him was the result of
a mis-shuffle of one card on the part of the dealer,
thus throwing all hands around one. He may not
be so fortunate next time.

Fogwell, the M.L. professional sculling
champion, met Hannan on the Wairau River last
Saturday, and by the end of the second mile was
well and truly licked. Hannan romped home event-
ually by 10 lengths. Time, 18min. 50sec.
“M. 8.”: “Outsider’s” par. (B. 23/2/’22)
descriptive of a “Fizzer ! s” performance in delivering
mails in N. Queensland set me thinking of the mail-
man who runs a tri-weekly service over the 22
miles' between Adaminaby and Kiandra (N.S.W.).
In winter, as soon as a fall of snow occurs, his coach
and pair have for weeks at a stretch to be aban-
donee! about 10 miles from Kiandra, and the journey
has to be completed by the Fizzer on his snow-
shoes. The drifts are often 20ft. deep and aU traces
of a read are obliterated ; but with the thermometer
down about zero, this casual Australian frequently
goes cheerfully forth into a blinding snowstorm, his
safety entirely depending on his expertness as a
snow-shoe rider and his almost uncanny skill in
finding his way through the silent wastes. The pay-
ment for his services is so modest that even the
most wooden-headed political aspirant would regard
it with great contempt. Yet the mailman’s life
hath pleasures townsfolk never know, for our Fizzer
has spent many years on this job, as, I understand,
his father did before him.
“Spinnaker” (Wellington. M.L.) : Joe Ward’s
offer of a Tasman cup for Australasian yachts has evoked
Some queer press comments, one being a suggestion
that Australian boats won’t be able to cross the
Tasman and vice versa. I should not hesitate to
tackle the run to Sydney in summer-time in a
staunch 10-tonner built for cruising, yawl-rig pi'e-
ferred. I know that many small luggers (12- and
13-tonners mostly) built at Kaipara and Whan-
gaioa for the Torres Strait pearling business have
made the voyage to Thursday Island. It would make
the conditions more equitably sporting than is the
case under the American Cup rules if both contes-
tants were required to be capable of a long ocean
trip on their own bottoms. Such a condition would
immensely improve the type of Australian and M.L.
yacht, and at the same time develop the sea-going
quality of the crews.
THE RECKLESS GAMBLER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For years Outback I’ve done my dough,
Inspired by coves' who think they know
The way to uppercut the “books”
And show a point or two to crooks.
I’ve planked my sugar on each moke
Well pleased that I was in the joke,
Nor whimpered when I learned my pot
Was on the stiffest of the lot.
I’ve wageredi this . way all my life.
One long, wild round of gambling strife
It’s been. I’d bet the sun won’t set,
Or that the ocean isn’t wet.
I’d wager on the morning’s news,
Or that we’ll have Lord Billy Hughes,
And shortly, as a punting king,
I mean to face the Randwick Ring.
Yes, there next month, I’ll open out,
Nor care a damn what tipsters shout.
I’ll trouble not if Gloaming’s “right”
Or whether Beauford’s jockey’s tight.
I’H pay no heed to Kashmir’s fame.
Or blanch to hear Eurythmie’s lame;
Careless of Caution’s craven voice
I’ll have five bob upon my choice:

Two extreme samples of fiendish weather
iought against the ceremonial opening of the
n ll w . threat Ocean Road. The crowd started
ott in a raging, hot, dusty north wind, and
returned in icy, sleety rain. Many bucked
at the danger of returning over a new track
greasy and slippery, along cliff-faces, and
several cut back by Birregurra. ■ Going,
there was a stop at C. J. Lane’s homestead
or lunch. The motorists pooled their
hampers and spread picnic fashion over the
hospitable house and verandahs, while the
Lane household prepared tea and coffee and
iced drinks. The Governor and Lady Strad-
broke week-ended at the Lome hotel, and
there was a special dinner-party at Erskine
House. All the hotels were crammed, and
local house-parties were legion. The outing
was most successful in spite of the winds
that howled and scorched and froze. The
Countess was impressed by the scenery, but
caught a bad cold with the change of
weather, and has, since bolted back to Mace-
don to get rid of it. ■
Mayor Hitchcock, of Geelong, is planning
further runs when the weather smiles. The
new road brings Lome within four hours of
Melbourne by motor. It has opened up a
lot of new country and put some brand-new
Falls on exhibition. The road is cut round
Big Hill—known to Western Districters for
ages for its tiptop view—but. there is still
much to be done at that steep, cliffy part to
make the drive comfortable for the nervous.
Mrs. Gardiner Mack; of Newtown, Gee-
long, had a lively house-party for the open-
ing. Her son Donald was on leave from
H.M.A.S. Sydney, and her two nieces—Mrs.
Chve Fairbairn, from Albury, and Mrs.
Stanley Burston, from Melbourne—motored
down for the week.
Lady Stradbroke got out of bed to go to
the Old Folks’ At Home in the Exhibition on
the 22nd. She could scarcely talk above a
whisper, but she said she had enjoyed last
year’s party so much that she just" had to
come. Clad in soft, clingy mole-colored robe
and furs, and backed by Lady Helena and
an aide, she'wandered round shaking hands
with the old folks. Mrs. Swanson poured
out tea, with Mrs. Hewison to help her hold
the enormous brown pot, Mrs. Alfred
Deakin, who was ill, missed the party for
the first time for many years. An enter-
tainment was given by the old people. One
lady of 82, in a canary-colored gown and
an early Victorian bonnet, sang “My Sweet-
heart When a Boy,” and a gay spark of
92 gave “The British Lion.” There were
1800 old folks present, including a man of
106 and a woman who had just tipped the
century. These re-unions were started by
Methodist-parson Edgar 28 years ago. and
since his death they have been carried on
by Mr. Hoban.
Lady Scott, widow of the Polar adventurer,
was married in England the other day to
Lieut.-Commander Hilton Young. Mel-
bourne has a remembrance of the vivid young
woman. On the eve of Scott’s departure
for the South there was a brilliant race-time
ball in Melbourne Town Hall. The oflicial
Lancers was a well-staged effect that took
up half the ballroom. Captain Scott and
his wife were in the set with almost-stranger
partners, but after this business was over
the two danced together for the rest of the
long programme. They looked a pair of
youngsters—he trim and nuggetty in his
naval uniform; she slim and slender in the
sheath of a sparkling Parisian frock. The
lady, who studied under Rodin, has done
some sculpture of note. Her statue of the"
explorer stands in Waterloo-place, London.
Son Peter is now nearly 12.
The newest idea for your winter lid is to
have huge jet “ear-rings” hanging from the
sides. They can be suspended from below a
wide brim or attached to the snug fold's of
a velvet toque. The same idea comes into
the evening head-dress, rings and chains cov-
ering the ears and falling to the shoulders.
Years ago Connie Waugh (bless her fascinat-
ing ideas!) came to a tremendous party at
the Theatre Royal in just this sort of head-
dress. Her gleaming black gown was cut
to the waist; and her Titian hair was tucked
into a tight-fitting jet cap pulled down over
her ears, with big, round Roman ear-rings
and loops touching her slim, snowy shoul-
ders. She had the other women just crazy
with envy.
From an Australian press-girl in London:
Marchioness Conyngham is going to take comfort
from Alfred B. Raper, M.P. for East Islington. The
lady, who used to be Bessie Alice Tobin, divorced
her Marquis last year. Her second venture is in
the timber trade. Perhaps the being
an Australian, will be content to appear as plain
Mrs. Raper. They are not all like that. Most Brit-
ish peeresses who have knocked their lords over-
board with a nisi hang oh to the title. And we
have to be very discreet about it, as thus: “Sus-
annah, Duchess of Pot Pourri, wife of Captain Blank
Cartridge.” You see, the Duke of Pot Pourri, having
married the other lady, can also produce a Duchess
of Pot Pourri, and if you’re not careful the conse-
quences are liable to be most entangling.
Elsie M. Holmes, who already has the
Empire Order, had a ceremony all to her-
self at the French Consulate the other day
when she was handed the diploma and bronze
medal of the Reconnaissance Francaise.
The Oriental was turned into a thorough-
going bazaar on the 22nd to help the funds
for the relief of “stricken Europe.” Barter
went on from 10 in the morning, and the
stall-holders were headed by those Sassiety
dames whose whole intere: t in life seems to
centre in charity stunts. ' fiss Mcßae gave
the tea-party and the use or her staff. Lady
Forster, president of the Australian fund,
made a practical speech, and then as prac-
tically did a bit of bazaar-shopping.
At the cafd chantant for the Stricken
Europe Fund there was a real carnival sale
of flowers. Lady Stradbroke and others sent
blooms from their Macedon gardens, and
Melba consigned a truckload from Coombe
Cottage. Maudie Fane, Madge Elliot, Winnie
Tait and other stars did the selling through
the lunch hour.
One wedding that is to take place in the
Harbor City in April is that of Capt. D. A.
Fowler, M.C., manager of the Bank of
N.S.W. at Saraarai (Papua), and Vivienne
Frances, widow of Capt. Clive E. Connelly
and daughter of the Henry Jacksons of
Bendigo.
Stanley J. Rihtoull, eldest son of Mr. and
Mrs. G. Rintoull, of Kilcatton Park, Dan-
denong, has placed an engagement ring on
the finger of Margaret I. A. Tulloch, eldest
daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. R. A.
Tulloch, of Sale.
Melbourne has a reverend lady in action
at present. She is E. Rosalind Lee, the
daughter of an English lawyer, and is pound-
ing the pulpit at the Unitarian Church,
Eastern Hill, sharing the preaching duties
there with Pastor Huston. Miss Lee bagged
her mathematical tripos at Cambridge in
1905. She went to Newnham from a high
school in Birmingham, and, as Cambridge
would not give her a degree because of her
sex, she collected her B.A. at Trinity Col-
lege, Dublin. She also put in a studious
interlude at Harvard (U.S.A.), where she
delved into philosophy and early Christian
history. In 1917 —when war made men-
pastors scarce—she was given a parish in
Wales. She is in Australia for only a few
months, and returns to England arter giv-
ing advice on modern movements to the Uni-
tarian Church. Travelling with her is
Hilda Hargrove, daughter- of the late pastor
of Mill Hill Church, Leeds (Eng.).
This is Monteath’s view of Dulcie Blhnd,
who captured the Champion Aggregate at
Launceston and South Street (Ballarat)
competitions. In particular the Ballarat sue-
cess is an osprey in
her hat. During this
test she did C. J.
Dennis’s “ ’Urry,” a
bit of “Julius
Caesar” and Goethe’s
“Erl King,” and a
remarkable version of
Dickens’s Quilp in
character showed a
dramatic ability that
it would be a pity to
waste on the concert
platform. The clever
girl, as a matter of
fact, has already
given the stage a
trial with the Mer-
maid Play Society,
and a while ago she
was heard in Arnold
Bennett’s “The Title,” Shakspeare’s “Comedy
of Errors” and Tchekov’s “The Proposal,”
scoring best as the volatile heroine of the
Russian playlet. Just now, however, she is
teaching other people how to speak, and she
has received a pat on the back from Allan
Wilkie, who has selected one of her pupils
to appear in “Richard III.” at the Palace
on Saturday night.
Miss Lottie Wagner is following her sister,
Mrs. Hammans, to the Fog early in Aoril.
The pair came back to Melbourne nearly two
years ago to take over their old home,
Stonington, from the State Government.
Then, just as they were arranging to chop
the acreage into villa allotments, the Govern-
ment offered to take a fresh lease at a higher
figure, and the deal was clinched.
Senator. Fairbairn has decided to fly a
“To-let” board from his Toorak home, Dun-
raven. The place is too full of memories of
his lost wife and daughter (Mrs. Stuart
Balmain). He will now transfer to a flat in
Fulham-avenue, on the Como estate, adja-
cent to the one in which brother Fred and
his wife will shelter when in town.
The Norton Grimwade pair have gone on a
pilgrimage to the grave of their soldier-son
in Gallipoli, and now the Harold Grim-
wades, with daughter Gwenda, are packing
their suit-cases to convoy son Thornton on
a Health trip to the land of banzais and
geishas. Incidentally, General Grimwade’s
palatial flattage in Domain-road is nearly
ready. One of the sections has been ear-
marked for his own use and another has been
snapped up by the wealthy, legal Whitings.
President Turnbull, of the Anzac Hostel,
is a busy, business-like young Digger. Mel-
bourne has scarcely been aware of the great
building that has been going up in Collin^-
street for the Re-
turned Soldiers. The
association bought a
block of buildings,
with land at the
back, and the front
premises have
screened the co n-
struction operations.
The hostel is now
practically finished
and will be opened
as soon as furnish-
ings, etc., are in
place. The property
cost £85,000. Diggers
Hudson and Wald-
rop were the archi-
tects, and another
Digger, Major Steve
Armstrong, the
builder. The original Collins-street front is
let as offices, and a line entrance hall takes you
through to the hostel. The reception-room
is a replica of the chief apartment at Aus-
tralia House, and, with its special floor,
should earn good money as a ballroom. The
council room, with its tiers of padded
benches, should also help to pay for its keep
with hire money. The architects presented
a fine ‘‘Speaker’s, chair” for this apartment,
which is to be a sort of Diggers’ parlia-
mentary chamber. A billiard-room with
half-a-dozen tables has alcove card-rooms.
There is a basement kitchen and an electric-
lift from a servery carries food to any floor.
Two large reception-rooms and some dress-
ing-rooms are set aside for war nurses, for
whom it is hoped later to build a special
flat of rooms aloft. In the. basement is a
huge store where Diggers may get cloth
and clothing, house linen and other supplies
at remarkably low prices. This store has
branches springing up in the larger country
centres, emphasising a mighty clinging to-
gether of Diggers. Lafayette made this pic-
ture of the president for The Bulletin.
Mrs. Harold Grimwade gave a dance the
other night at Marathon, the lovely old place
at Frankston which was, bought from the
Jacksons some time ago. A strong sou’-
westerly spoilt the garden-sitting part of
the programme, but plenty of stout awning
made verandah corners snug. It was veiy
much a flapper dance, and the youngsters
jazzed till the cows were bailed.
The A. E. V. Richardsons are giving a
dance at their Glenferrie home on April 8
as a very last send-off to May Maxwell be-
fore she sails for the Cold Land.
The Melbourne Music Club runs a fine
library to which it has just added a whole
aviary of songs by French, Russian and
Finnish composers—some of them the gift of
Dame Nellie. A special recital was given
at the Club a day or two ago by Doris
Hadden and Lilian Stott in honor of fiddler
Ernest Toy and his wife.
Fairie Mac Gee, siste» of the popular
Collins-street doctor, sailed for Africa on
the Themistocles. With brother Harry she
war-worked in the Park-lane Hospital, spon-
sored by Mrs. Fink and presided over by Dr.
Shields. Miss Lilian Stretch, who became
Mrs. Harry Mac Gee last year, was the
matron. A brother lives in Jo’burg. Hence
this latest voyaging.
Lady Loughborough has helped to make
a “picture,” and a special private peep is
being arranged to show her walking through
the film. The lady declares it is not a fad—
she means to go right into the business.
Latest news of Irma Caron and tall M. P.
Adams, her husband, was that they had just
concluded a visit to the songstress’s aunt
Irma, at Dijon. Their business, after holi-
days, is the provincial tour of Australia’s
Wild Nor’-West film, whereon Adams lec-
tures while abbs, ride barebacked turtles
about the screen. And Irma sin'gs songs
as wild nor’-western as she can make them.
Jennie Brenan visited her friend Gende ’
in London. The little lady is now in dainty
retirement, but is putting a whole heap of
energy into the encouragement of young
dancers and artistic dancing. Genre’s house
is an exquisite museum of things collected
all over ihe world —many of them presents
from famous people who expressed their ad-
miration in the highest forms of art.
Charles Courtneidge, the self-contained
young lover of “Paddy, the Next Worst
Thing,” had some trying as well as flying
experiences in the war. At the beginning
he enlisted in a cavalry regiment, but was
kicked into hospital by an infuriated steed.
While lying abed the noise of aeroplanes
turned his thoughts to aviation, so he aban-
doned the cavalry, and in due course be-
came a pilot. When Zepp raids threatened
poor old Blighty, his crowd were despatched
across the Channel to the rescue. Engines
were pretty faulty in those days, and young
Courtneidge’s ’bus came to. grief when he
was within two miles.pf the shore. He and
his observer had an unhappy life on the
ocean wave until a boat came near enough
for them to brandish a token of distress,
and they were picked up in a very wet
condition. Courtneidge remained in the
aerial business for two or three years, but,
having returned to the theatrical profession,
has no itching to take up cloud-raking as
a pastime. A man should school his nerve
to one thing or the other, he thinks.
In the first week in April a delegation
from the Apprenticeship Conference will
drop in on Sydney to pick up points, and
then go on to Brisbane. This is no joy
jaunt, as they are all keen on submitting
such a report as will force the Government
to bring forward legislation next session.
There still is money in sawdust. Circus-
man George Wirth has just bought an
Esplanade frontage at St. Kilda, close to
Carlyon’s, and intends to put up a pile of
flats on it.
A linen-tea' for the insatiable Alfred Hos-
pital is booked . for to-day (Thursday! at
the hospital. President Senator Fairbairn
will be there, and Dame Mary Hughes.
A Hobart widow, a large and cheerful
person who . cultivates rhses and gambols
with Pomeranian pups and Persian cats, is
alleged to have paid 1700 guineas for a
fur-coat a few weeks ago. The story goes
that the glad rag was acquired for Hobart
Cup Day, but as the weather threatened to
be dull, with possible showers, the lady de-
cided to do Ehvick lawn in less expensive
garb. The coat is Russian sable, and as
the pelt of this scarce and shv little Arctic,
beastie fetches from £l5 to £2O, and as a
greatcoat calls for 80 or 90 skins, the price
of the garment that wasn’t worn to the
Hobart Cun does not seem, at least from
one viewpoint, outrageous.
Adelaide passes on a little gossip:—
The S.P.C.A. is bemoaning the loss of Miss Risch-
bieth, who has run its junior branch for years and
done much towards making the young human animal
deal more kindly with its four-footed brother. Her
place is to be taken by Mrs. Bunyard, another keen
worker for the society.
At the Glee Club concert for Clara Serena and
her husband every seat was sold in advance, and
the crowd was as big in enthusiasm as in size.
Serena was at her best, and at the finish wanted a
pantechnicon to carry away the flowers and intrigu-
ing-looking parcels that were handed up to her. Roy
Mellish said their mutual thanks in iust the right
way; and the three cheers that Darnley Naylor
called for are still echoing round the town.
In spite of bad times, the R-.C.’s are embarking-
cheerfully on a hunt for £BO,OOO to finish their
cathedral. Archbishop Spence promises that it is
going to be a “very beautiful edifice,” in which
case most of the present structure will have to be
pulled down or built over.
Three well-known men have recently gone west:
Ernest Cowle, a brother of the Josiah Symon dame;
R. E. Gooden, one of the younger members of the
Stock Exchange, who married Albion Tolley’s elder
daughter; and solicitor R. Cruiekshank, for years
chairman of the Port Racing Club and one of the
chief factors in its rapid success.
The Weigalls gave a good-bye party to the school-
children of the near-by hills districts at Marble Hill
the other day, with the Humphrey Bishop co. as
chief entertainers. The Cohens are giving their
Exes, a valedictory dinner at the Town Hall about
a week before they sail.
The Darnley Naylors, just back from 15 months
in England, have been duly welcomed by the
Workers’ Educational Assoc., for which they have both
done excellent work since it was planted here. The
association, by the way, was lucky enough to get
the first of Archibald Strong’s lectures in this vil-
lage—a brilliant survey of Elizabethan life.
Adelaide is beaming over the honor that has come 1
to Bessie Davidson as an Associate of the French
National Salon. No one has ever made less fuss over
her achievements than she, and few S. Australians
who have wooed success overseas have gone so surely
and consistently ahead.
Sydney’s astronomical professor, Ernest Cooke,
has been here on a visit. He is a ison of the late
Ebenezer Cooke, who was our Commissioner of
Audit for ever-so-long, and his brother Joseph is a
member of our Uppish House.
James Ashton is showing some of the results of his
Christmas visit to the Sydneyside. He gets bits
of the harbor, and sweeping views of the South
‘Coast, in his accustomed manner; the meeting of
sea and shore has always been his favorite hunt-
ing ground. But he finds new subjects at Leura
and Katoomba —the mountains by sun and shade,
noonday and night, and especially in the sea of mist
which is so marvellous to a South Australian.
Melba has given a testimonial to Rita Coonan,
an Adelaide singer, with a promise of “free tuition
at my conservatorium, as I feel sure if sl.e is given
a chance she will make a big career.” Adelaide is
asked to find £l5O for her living expenses in
Melbourne this year, and for a guaranteed £5OO
more “if I decide that she should go to Paris and
eventually London.”

The Melba Pops have ousted all other
musical events of the week, the attendance
warming up night after night till Saturday’s
audience sat on its eyebrows or a bar of
music or any old thing available. The audi-
ence wasn’t quite the same as it is at ordi-
nary concerts. There were rows of comfort-
able-looking old ladies and gentlemen, who
addressed each other as “Father” and
“Mother.” There were rows of hardy cre-
tonne and useful voile worn by the flapper
minus and the flapper plus. In short, it
was the good old ardent concert-goer over-
flowing suddenly from the back cliairs and
eddying to every corner of the Town Hall.
The same programme was served up on the
four nights with variations in the encores
and the Melba dresses and jewels. Una
Bourne’s hands scampered over the keyboard
like white magic; John Lemmone fluted wist-
fully and plaintively ; Skalski conducted.
The story told by a Labor candidate that,
had the Dooley Goverament been defeated in
1920, George Fuller would have become
Lord Fuller of Allowrie, is a blood-relation of
one that is started nowadays about evei’y
political leader with money and conservative
principles. The aspersion was cast at W. M.
Hughes during his last assault on Bendigo,
and no doubt will be again. The only
genuine move in the direction of creating a
N. S. Wales peerage occui’red in Went-
worth’s time. It was laughed out of the
State then, and the eating years have not
caused the idea to become any less ludicrous.
The stone front of the Mater Misericordiae
Hospital blossomed into festoons and hang-
ing baskets of flowers for four days last
week in a burst of direct advertising of the
F§te within its grounds. The hospital has
an enei-getic committee, which is out to
slaughter the big building’s overdraft, and
last week’s activity, blessed by Mayoress
McElhone, was a' welter of gaily-stocked
stalls and hustling tinders. Mrs. Phipps and
Mrs. Dan Kelly flourished over an entangle-
ment of jazz garters-and giddy dress hangers,
while a flutter of white-veiled novices reck-
lessly patronised the busy chocolate wheels.
Mrs. Conriek organised the cafe chantant
that enlivened each evening; and treasurers
Mrs. Leahy and Miss Coffee are smiling over
their latest count that has a thousand pounds
well in sight. But how could the f@te be
anything but a joyous success when it chose
a secretai'y with the festive name of Mrs.
P. Nutte —even though the u is pronounced
long?
The gentle lambkin was butchered midway
through S.P.C.A. week to make a Went-
worth feast at which the Millions Club ex-
tolled kindness to dumb animals. However, the
lambkin got something of its own back by a
sort of organised passive resistance. U.S.A.
Consul Norton reminded the company that
it was one Martin, M.P., of Galway, who
first introduced legislation for the protection
of animals into the English House of Com-
mons ; whereupon the fluffy toy dogs guard-
ing the door between Palm Court and Cafe
waved their plumey tails in remembrance of
stirring things that since then have hap-
pened to many animals in many parts of
Ireland. Mayor McElhone whispered some
soul-touching anecdotes to the neighboring
tables, and president of the society Acoeks
combined a thanksgiving and a prayer for
more funds. Fi’anlc Coffee coyly detached
himself from the millinery worn by his San
Francisco niece and his daughter Dorothy.
The Califorian “natural” blonde had drawn
a crimson feather toque cosily around the
.Tersey-lily complexion, while the dark-haired
Sydney lass .sported twin headgear canned
out in jade green—the combined effect was
that of a paraakeet perching in mid-flight
for a snack. Consul Norton’s lady was in
a necklace of opals. Of course there was
a dress, and a hat, and even shoes. But
the hypnotised feminine eye realised only
that string of opal beads.
Two of Sydney’s richest R.C. families
were linked last week, when the P. R. Lar-
kins, of Coogee, handed over only daughter
Nell to the care of Norman Foley, of the
Sussex-street produce firm. The wedding
was an affair of relations who had come
from the five corners of Australia for the
occasion, with the Church of Our Lady of
the Sacred Heart as the sccaxe. The bi’ide’s
frock was built on a simple plan of ivory
velvet, its only trimming a mediaeval-looking
girdle of chenille and gold; the traditional
veil wa§ replaced by an ivory velvet hat
with a tassel of cream and gold. Brides-
maid Lorna Carey wore a dream in silver-
grey Morocain, and clutched a handful of
pink carnations. Bridegroom’s tw-o little
nieces, Patricia and Joan, in pink fluffery,
helped best-man brother A- W. Foley to
cheer up all parties. The refreshments were
spread at the Australia, where the bride’s
mother did the honors in rich brown trap-
pings in a bower of pink lilies.
The austerity of Scots’ Church, Woollahra,
was brightened the other evening by the
bridal brochd satin of Nora Carson. She is
the younger of the Duncan Carsons’ daugh-
ters, and her dress drew in its wake a trail
of silver tulle reminiscent of the ones Port
Jackson hangs on to the ferries on a moon-
lit night. Adam Jones Campbell was the
young man who had made the date with her,
and he stood well up to the altar rails sup-
ported sturdily by his second, Rupert Ryder.
Bride’s sister Haidee, ’groom’s sister Peggy,
and Nita Lindeman were a trio of pretty
bridesmaids frocked in a color rhapsody of
pale pinks and blues and violet. An evening
frock of black satin enveloped the bride for
the first stage of the matrimonial voyage.
Her future home will be Mount Penandra,
Gulargambone.
Another bride of the week was Rosalie
Cowdery, of Strathfield, who became Mrs.
Max White, of Woorang Downs, Moree, at
St. Paul’s, Burwood. Later on she .set off
to discover the North Coast through honey-
moon eyes.:
The Perth wedding of the month was that
of Topsy Ashby Backlake, who before her
tragically short war marriage was Topsy
Domela. The young thing’s second venture
is a retired Lieut.-Commander, K. S. M.
Herbert, R.N., and they took each other for
better or worse at St. George’s Cathedral.
Four bridesmaids and. a small trainbearer
followed the xvhite satin and seed-pearl en-
crusted little bride, who was given away by
her mothei-.
Helen Laidley, Mrs. Reggie Laidley’s
pretty daughter, is to marry Pat Levy, the
Sep Levys’ younger son, at the beginning of
next month. They will be united accord-
ing to. the ritual of the Jewish Church. The
last big mixed marriage of the sort occurred
when Frank Osborne and Daisy Gollin were
joined in an improvised synagogue in a gar-
den on Bellevue Hill. The bride-to-be is a
niece of Mrs. Neville Dangar and of
Shepheard Laidley, and has one sister who
married last yeaix
A few years ago the winning horses at
the big meetings around Sydney wei'e owned
mostly either by trainers or by persons who
concealed their identities behind aliases like
the better class of pigeon-slayer. Last
Saturday’s results at Rosehill indicated the
change of fashion in this direction. Colin
Stephen won one event, Pat Osborae
another, and J. J. Garvan a third, while
Sam Hordern took a second and Arthur
Bowman a third. The Union and Austra-
lian Clubs have not been so well represented
at Rosehill in the history of the course.
This picture hat
frames Lily Laing’s
pretty face. She is
one of a family of
good-looking Mosman
girls, and when they
go out in company
they’re as danger-
ous as even “the
beautiful Miss Gun-
nings” who, history
tells us, had a guard
when they walked
abroad to keep the
crowd fi-om ap-
proaching too near.
The Mosman girl’s
title to fame lies in
her popularity as a
ballad singer and
her perennial engage-
ment with the Keith Kennedy Concert Com-
pany, which has just returned from touring
in Asia. Lily’s father was formerly chief of
N.S.W. Hansard staff.
Artist Tom Roberts, having had a taste of
Australian sunlight last year, can’t keep
away. He is planning to return late this
year; and then probably Australia will have
him to the end.
Mrs. Domerschikoff and her small boy
were among the passengers by the Ceramic.
The courageous lady hopes to rejoin her hus-
band in Russia in 1923. As many adventures
as go to the making of the popular Russian
novel have befallen the North Shore girl
since she married her Russian refugee in
Sydney a year before the war. With the
war he returned to his beloved navy, despite
the probability of political imprisonment.
Then so many things happened in Russia
and so quickly that husband and wife an
child went through all the misery of a deten-
tion camp, only to be liberated to the regime
of the Soviet. A year ago she and the boy
were allowed by Soviet headquarters to
return to Sydney., but the husband was
not permitted the journey.
Eugenie Callachor, of Coogee and until
last year of Queensland, has had her first
book, “Enid,” accepted by Hodder and
Stoughton. The lass is midway through
another novel that also drapes itself
against a Queensland background. “Enid,”
incidentally, had the misfortune to book hex-
first passage in a torpedoed vessel; but the
back-country authoress found her in the ink-
pot and dredged her out with a pen.
Talking about novel-writing, prolific Zora
Cross has just completed another romance
of North Queensland called “The Lute Girl
of Rainyvale.” She confesses to have fallen
in this under the sway of the wave of
chinoiserie which is sweeping through our
literature, our art and our embroideries, even
as it did a century and a half ago.
New Prison-Chief TJrquhart is a poor man
at his job. He has had to shut up shop
three times now, the last key he turned
being in the front door of Darlinghurst.
However, if he’s the Master of the Closed
Door, his young writing daughter knows
something about breaking the most conser-
vative of them open. She is that rare bird,
an Australian who had her first book pub-
lished in her own country without cost to
herself. Her second book goes to London
in a few months’ time.
Herewith Brenda
Deloitte, who lets
loose a full-toned
’cello or supplies
piano accompani-
ments at the Sea-
men’s Institute
whenever the men
from the ships have
a concert arranged
for them. Brenda is
of the old seafaring
Deloitte stock, and
can swim, fish or
sail a boat with any
man. Besides the
record number of
appearances she has
put up at the Insti-
tute, she is a mem-
ber of the State
Orchestra, though she owes her training not
to the Conservatorium, but to Bryce Carter.
Gladys Owen has hung F. E. DeGroot’s
rooms in Lanark House with 35 water-
colors of a charm that flooded a hot morn-
ing last week with restful coolness. Hyde
Park seems to have captured the artist’s
fancy, though indeed she has never been one
of the unemployed. The marvel is that the
industrious war-worker has had time to
throw a glance in the direction of Nature
for the past seven years. But perhaps the
glimpse of Blue’s Point makes the most inti-
mate appeal, with Elizabeth Farm running
a close second.
Portia Geach, a dream of model kitchens
and housewifely marketing hanging upon
each eyelash, has returned to Sydney. She
had a cocktail in New York, her Christmas
dinner in Rome, wine and nuts at Madeira
and in Spain, a turn of the wheel at Monte
Carlo, a shake-down at Shepheard’s in
Cairo, with rapturous interludes up the
Nile, and, of course, a soliloquy oh the Pyra-
mids by moonlight. As a pick-me-up she
had Ada Reeves as travelling companion in
the Orvieto. They both disembarked at
Melbourne.
Mrs. Sydney Want, who died in England
recently, was one of the best-known figures
in Sydney society 30 years ago. A daughter
of Bartholomew' Doyle, of Killarney station,
she married a partner in the old firm of
attorneys whose partners included Jimmy
Johnson and Simpson and Minter. Jack
and Randolph Want were her brothers-in-
law r , and another was Fred, whose son
(Lang) and daughter (Mrs. Charlie Cape)
are still living in Sydney.
Henry Noyes, a brother-in-law of Mrs.
Edward Noyes, died in Melbourne last week.
He was a retiring little Englishman, like his
brother; and, though he was often in Syd-
ney. on the business of the big engineering
firm which these tw r o sons of a Northampton-
shire parson built up, he avoided the social
life' of the place. He worked hard for the
Red Cross till his health failed, and gave
generously to all war objects.
Alec Joske, who died last week, was a
partner in Brown and Joske, a well-known
Islands and Sydney firm, and a popular mem-
ber of the Australian Club. His son, Cap-
tain Joske, M.C., is a Bulletin contributor
w'ho did good work in the Flying Corps; and
Nell Joske, a daughter, is one Of Sydney’s
best dancers.
The wizard MacCormick has just had an
uncommon patient for a stiff surgical oper-
ation at the Terraces—Queensland’s ex-P.M.
and police-chief W. E. Parry-Okeden, who,
at 82, still towers far above the 6ft. mark.
Taken to the big private hospital where
MacCormick does most of his private oper-
ations, the Man from Snowy River looked
round and said an introduction wrasn’t
necessary—he knew the place well when the
Burton Bradleys lived there 50-odd years
ago. Friends came in to say good-bye; but
the day after the operation he was writing
to one of them: "I know you were getting
some nice post obit remarks to throw after
me. You’ll have to postpone them again.”
Monaro grows its children tough.
-The Professorial Mackies, who have been
picking up brain-vibrations in England and
Scotland, were welcomed back to the bosom
of_ the Teachers’ College one night last week.
-Lfm grounds were dazzling with illuminations
and electric with intellect, for staff and stu-
dents and friends all told numbered nearly
a thousand. There were lantern lecturettes
for those who like a slice of education in
the sandwich of pleasure; there was music
for the mere entertainment-seeker; there was
a cold buffet and an out-of-doors orchestra
tor all.
The Belgian Consular Segaerts welcomed
flapper-daughter Henriette one day last week,
youthful-looking father and mother chartering
a launch to say good morning to the Nestoi”
which carried their jewel back to them after
a three-years’ polishing in Paris schools and
Brussels music conservatoires. Ilenriette is
a rounded slip of pink-and-whiteness, with
a warm chuckle of a laugh and dazzling eyes
and teeth. Strictly, she has not yet made
her official entry into society, though she was
the guest of honor at a Melbourne dinner
party where most of the cavaliers were
Italian men-of-war. She is to assist father
in . entertaining while Mrs. Segaert pays a
flying visit to her people in Belgium.
Pamela Armstrong has her own ideas of
Grandma Melba’s singing. One day, at
Coombe,. when the Voice was practising, she
walked into the musical workshop. To her
surprise her abject slave, absorbed in pour-
ing out floods of song, ignored her. Pamela
stood the slight for a moment; then walk-
ing sternly up to the Queen of Song she
gripped her hand with authority, and
“Grandma, stop that horrid noise! Stop that
horrid noise, Grandma!” she commanded.
Bertram Stevens’s pen in the Art in
Australia office is being taken up by poet
and school-teacher Leon Gellert. Ure Smith
will continue to look after the art side of
the two publications.
Mrs. V enour Nathan, who, with the in-
fants, has been visiting Leura, has gone
back to the Bowral home, where she can
really get a chance to practise the dancing
which is. as much part of the slim lady’s life
as sleeping or eating. At the moment she
is working out a creation inspired by one
of Hans Andersen’s prettiest fairy tales.
Concert-manager Gravestock, with his
family, lock, stock and barrel, left early this
week for Maoriland to welcome Itosina Buck-
man and her husband, Maurice D’Oisly, to
Maoriland. Rosina belongs to Whangarei,
which is away up north —the same town
that produced Jane Mander, who wrote the
“Story of a New Zealand River.” The whole
of that countryside is preparing a joyous
welcome for its famous daughter. There’s
even talk of arranging for a special session
of the Aurora Australis.
Agent-General Coghlan’s lady waited to
see daughter Eden on board the Orvieto, and
then dashed off to Bowral for the week-end.
She herself intends remaining in Australia
some time yet.
Poetess Mary Gilmore, who had just re-
turned to town after nearly a year’s health-
seeking in Goulburn, struck another patch of
bad luck the other day when she dislocated
her foot—three bones are out of place and
one is splintered. Mrs. Gilmore, who dis-
missed the accident lightly at first, is now
paying double, and has been ordered to hos-
pital in the Mountains.
This (Thursdays) evening, at St. James’s
Hall, contralto Agnes Langborne will intro-
duce a sweet and well-trained voice to Syd-
ney notice. Agnes is one of the younger
singing set, a pupil of Golden Grove Con-
vent and holder of silver medals from
Trinity College. She is that anomaly, a
young Australian who doesn’t aspire to
Covent Garden or the Albert Hall, but is
content to win laurels on her home
fields.
Stella George, of Neutral Bay, held her
group of listeners spellbound the other after-
noon at the Lyceum Club when she told
them all about her visit to Tagore’s school
at Shanti Nikitan. Like Norman Lindsay,
the Indian poet holds that art will redeem
the world, and he believes the glowing re-
ception of his lectures in Germany was due
to the. Germans being sated with material-
ism, wherefore they are groping after the
spiritual in life.
May Sheehan, the curly-haired young sec-
retary of St. Margaret’s Hospital for Women,
is already busy with plans to make the
Bourke-street institution rival its Crown-
street sister. A monster musical matinee
at the King’s Cross Theatre and a Cretonne
dinner-dance at the Wentworth are the im-
mediate money-magnets.
Mrs. Quinlan, wife of the versatile Tom
who is to manage the tour of the SAtine
Choir, is in Hobart, where only-child Pat
is a pupil at St. Virgil's College. Mrs. Tom is
a niece of Captain Richardson, of Australia's
own navy.

help you to breathe and develop properly, and make all
the organs of the body perform their functions correctly.
No apparatus is required, and each lesson is graded
to suit particular individual requirements.
“Snowy” Baker has written a most interesting booklet,
all about the course, “Health and Strength from Self-
Culture,” which contains many valuable hints, jlf: you

T.C.J.: On last available figures “Adel-

races (exclusive of Australian aborigines) S. Aus.
had only 26 per 10,000 of its people as against Vic.’s
46; N.S.W.’s 70, Q.’s 187 and Westralia’s 200; and

....Picky: There must be a hundred little things
you know more about. Take them for your sub-
jects .... Inter Alia: Work for that page must be
done much better than that... .Carstairs: Buried
in quicklime... .B.B.: Destroyed accordingly....
Douglas C.: It doesn’t seem to lend itself to that
treatment.... P.8.P.: “Dobbin” hardly worth har-
nessing; but he is well groomed... .Swanson: You’ve
got the yarn, but not the skill to tell it....
K.W.C.: One of the tantalising “possibles,” with not
quite enough strength to kick itself in....E.A.: Rub-
bish. You have mistaken “democratised” for “de-
graded”.... Kat: It sings itself with a faint, floppy
rapture -
Oh, the Autumnal Morn ! It’s kind,
With its silvery dew, its placid way,
And meek sky. Such a soothing grey!
It’s an excellent beginning for a perfect da}'.
It brings its developer, Clod, to my mind.
Mingling with an Autumn morn is the sweetest
thing I find.
When my fevered brow, so hot,
Is stroked by the raptured Autumn beauty,
It instils within me the cardinal point of duty,
That makes a contented mind, a happy heart,
And makes me (to God) thanks impart
For the joy, the lessons that I got.
I snuggle closer, like the brown hills,
To breathe the pure air, feel the breeze, and
drink the dewy trills,
And listen to the lilting green trees,
Autumnal-tuned, perfectly, by every breeze
That God controls. I watch the mingling
blue in the sky,
Through the nodding foliage, all in pale grey,
so shy.
... .Marjorie C.: Not for us... .Karnie: Doesn’t get
near. .. .W.J.T.: Worn commonplaces piled up to pro-
duce a general effect that doesn’t matter... .Palmyra:
Goes heavily, with large jolts and a great scarcity
of rhyme... .E.B. (Balmain) : Never heard of it....
Don Three: “Forty” has points, but not enough of
them; “The City” is very poor.... Gus: Not a bad
idea, but rather clumsily handled and ending in an
alleged rhyme that makes the skin creep... .Jane
L. : It’s a very ordinary little garden, with a nasty
weed trailing .at the end of each stanza... .Becky:
“Martin” is impossible... .Jack A. W.: The shark
verse is seasonable:—•
The seas are crammed with outlaws, though the
pirates’ day is past,
For many a dreadful, cowardly shark lurks ’neath
the billows vast.
In the wakes of ships that wrestle with obstreperous,
ramping storms,
Sinister-looking swordfish glide in fierce, expectant
swarms.
Cheered by sights like jury-masts, half rigged with
tattered sails,
Are myriads of such monsters off the coast of New
South Wales!
.. . . R.M.8.: Sorry, but we don’t like “Margaret”
well enough to buy a new pink kimono for her....
Jack W.: The breaking heart crackles so stiffly as to
suggest that it was pretty brittle before the smash.
.... 8.C.P.: It has an extravagant note that spoils
it; and the subject isn’t of much account... .James
W.: Now, then, get out your handkerchief, for we’re
going to print it:—
When one is lonely and in distress
It’s then one comes to think
Of the times you spent at home
In that beautiful haven of bliss.
But the world has to keep on turning
Though it cost much pain and toil.
And many are left behind
One never thought would fail.
It’s then he thinks of long ago
Before he commenced to roam,
’Tis then one understands his loss
Of his long forgotten home.
... .Hannibal: “Futility” is up to its title. .. .Pat L.:
You don’t make out a good case... .Nemo: Sheer
commonplace... .G.A.H.: The mirth seems to have
been mislaid somewhere... ,G.I. (Townsville): It is
in a poor sonnet form with one bad rhyme and little
to say....A.M. (Hunter’s Ilill) : All fluent, rather
irregular in form and thin in matter... .K.M.D.:
Might have been bright, but you let it down badly
through leaving out the alternate rhymes.... King
K.: Not up.... Nancy H.: The “Triolet” is too
slight. It’s a rather poor trick form, anyhow....
Rin Chin: The verse doesn’t carry it, but the
idea is worth another attempt... Sookie: Not enough
in it E.A.C.': Very lumpy stuff... .11.8. (Denili-
quin): “The Poet” misses... .Curragong: Bad
rhymes, bad everything Irvine D.: Glad to hear
from your father’s son... . Battleaxe: Too late for
print, but not for congratulations... .Wayb.-Sub:
The Queensland rates are higher, on the wh01e....J.
Car: Renew that invitation to “the bush banquet
in the Macdonnell Ranges” when you see the
railway coming May McK.: Can’t say whether
“chastity was practised by the fierce Red Indians
of the Five Nations.” Anyhow, it didn’t save them
from becoming five dead nations J.A.S.: Not
quite... .Adele N.: Bright. Let’s hear again....
K.P.: Rather late... .Passim: The same idea was
illustrated by Percival a few weeks ago... .P.S.W.:
Moss-grown... .M.G.: A bit too late. .. .H.A.H.:
Sleep came half-way through... .S.R.: That “hor-
rible” must have applied to your pome Ziff:
Not quite up; but you’re on the right track....
Roving Reg: You have nothing new to say so far.
. ...W.C.M.: Not pithy enough 0.5. F.: You
seem to have made a hobby of collecting old gags.
....W.G.W.: Closed down on that; try something
else... .Crroak: The frogs do no harm....Hargo:
Shirt yarn told of Purves last year... .S.D.: Try
some more J.W.: Hardly worth space... .Brace:
Just misses... .D.H.: Utterly impossible to handle
that dlose typewriting... .A.L.: No market here.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.

ever littered... .J.D.: All mi55....W.8.A.: You
need a tonic... .J.M.: Warned ,0ff....M.D.:

Bulletin.” H.W.S.: Going back 11.5. K.: Not
quite up W.V.W.: Drawing shows promise, but
gags are painfully weak... .5.8.: All out

“I am delighted with

to use it.
“Rexona Soap is miles

' I should think that every
girl would use it, and I
am sure they do if they
have once tried it. It is
so good for the com-
plexion, too; it leaves the
skin so clear and fresh.
“I have a pot of Rexona

Scallywag Schooner.
[FOR THE BULETIN.]
r*l lIE scallywag schooner lurched in
I 1 through the night,
JL Her drunken old topsail tip-tilted
askew?
A littie too noisy to be quite polite,
And tumbled her anchor at dawn through
the blue.
She held a good helping of wind where she
stayed,
’Twixt the lip o’ the land and the brink
o’ the sea;
Too lankily lean for legitimate trade,
And a halliard shrilled where a flag ought
to be.
The town wakened up on the knees o’ the
hill.
On the hill lolling back in the lap o’ the
sky;
And the scallyway schooner sat sullenly still,
Like a draggled old hag with a cast in
her eye.
Old innkeeper Tim he ’ad “seen ’em afore —•
Them scallyway schooners what suddenly
come
Like groggy-mouthed tramps to an honest
man’s door” ;
And he spoke, between hiccoughs, of lace
and of rum.
Yet he reckoned “Fair fishing, the wind
from the bay” ;
Come twilight, he’d rig up his lines and
the boat,
An’ push out and see what the fish had to
say;
And his guinea-coins chinked in the tail of
his coat!
Then the revenue cutter stepped out from
the town —
From the pool where it dreamed at the
foot of the street;
She walked like a girl in a dimity gown,
With a little white poodle that fawned
at her feet.
There was wagging of legs by the break of
the rail
When the scallywag schooner awaked from
her doze,
And her tip-toeing spars blossomed out into
sail—•
As brave as the blossoms on Timothy’s
nose.
White heels, and the lash of the wake as
it swirled!
The scallywag schooner, nose down to
the spray.
Her arms reaching out for the rim of the
world,
Went roaring and roaring and roaring
away.
Then the revenue cutter tripped back to
the land
To settle her kirtle and ribbon her shoe;
And she flashed her command with a wave
of her hand—
’Twas a job for her uncle the frigate
to do.

BOYCE BOWDEN.
Table Legs, Wooden Heads and a
Woman’s Heart.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the introduction to a recent edition of
some of my rhymes it was printed that I
went in for spiritualism when I first
came to Sydney. I didn’t, though I
was induced at one time to fool with
hypnotism, which is a different proposi-
tion altogether. But I had sense enough
to break away and go. back to beer
(the original idea was to cure me of it)
before the thing drove me to madness and
murder, or, at the very least, to arrest for
being on premises that were not my own
under the impression that I owned the street. I
believe now I could tell the victim of hypno-
tism in a very few minutes wherever I met
him. I have seen him both in gaols and in
asylums. The blackest criminal can hypno-
tise himself into the belief that he is a
martyred saint, and I wonder how many Tom
Pinches have been hypnotised or have hypno-
tised themselves into the belief that they are
born Jack the Rippers. When'you hear of a
case of incipient insanity, generally a weak
little man, whining about having lost his “cur-
rent” or “wave” or something like that, as
if it were his false teeth, you know what’s
the matter with him. He is fooling with
hypnotism, or suggestion, or whatever they
call it. I believe that hypnotism, in one
form or another, has been responsible for
some of the most ghastly outrages and
tragedies of the lonely bush, and directly
and indirectly for the presence of a great
number of innocent men in gaol. But to
take the taste out of the mouth let us get
back to the old table-rapping which, com-
pared with hypnotism, was a harmless
children’s game.
Time, nine to ten. Small table in centre
of floor in the front room of the old home
on the old selection 45 years ago. Mother
takes charge with the air of a martyr to cir-
cumstances (she generally did), at the centre
of one side of the table, supported on either
hand by the growing daughters of two neigh-
bors. Opposite her on the other side is
father, flanked by an old digger mate on one
side and this old mate's wife upon the other.
Father’s o.m.’s wife doesn’t believe in no
such nonsense, and is only there to oblige
Louisa (mother), who is an old schoolmate
of hers. Pier son Fred sits opposite to me,
at the other end, my brother -Charley being
away on one of his juvenile expeditions into
the North-West (he staved thei'e for many
years later). Incidentally, a horse is miss-
ing from a neighboring squatter’s run, but it
will turn up alone in a week or so and “no
harm done to nobody.” Father’s undoubting
blue eyes are fixed on mother; he is waiting
to be astonished and to believe. His strong,
knotted hands are pressed firmly, palms down,
on the table, ready to use strength enough
to tilt a two-hundred-gallon iron tank.
Mother always addressed the table, or the
alleged spook that moved it, in a tone she
would use to a boy she’d “ketched’ to run
a message. (The boy, by the way, was usu-
ally long and bare and freckled of leg, with
Arab leanings below, and of strong Irish
tendencies towards the top; rather unpopu-
lar than otherwise with the steady-going
settlers around, but, after a first business
contract, a firm adherent of mother’s.)
Mother: “Are any spirits present? If
so, please signify in the usual manner—One
knock for ‘No’ and three for ‘Yes.’ ”
The table creaks and strains and behaves
like a rhinoceros heaving itself out of the
mud. We even feel the cold breath of the
river across our knuckles. The table-legs
on mother’s side rise painfully, as if uproot-
ing themselves from the floor, to the limit of
equilibrium—pause, hesitate, or waver, then
fall with a tremendous thud, and the furni-
ture is again as dead as an overturned
anvil.
Mother: “Does that mean no?”
Table repeats the operation.
Mother: “Come now, is there anyone
present? Yes or no?”
Table legs (rather startled) : “Prod, prod,
prod !”
Mother: “Then there is someone present?”
Legs (anxious to please) : “Prod, prod,
prod !”
Mother: “Very well, then. Now begin
with the letter a and stop when you reach the
last letter. Now begin.”
Legs (submissively but distinctly) : “Prod,
prod, prod!”
Mother: “Is that —that c?”
Legs: “Prod, prod, prod!” (Meaning
“I said so.”)
Mother (getting a bit mixed) : “I beg
your pardon. I thought it might have been
‘Yes.’ Next letter, please.”
Legs (a bit wearily) : “Prod, prod, prod,
prod, prod, prod. .prod... .prod !”
Mother: “Is that lif”
Legs (resignedly, but tolerantly) : “Prod,
prod, prod!”
Mother: “Next letter, please.”
Legs: “Prod!”
Mother: “Is that a?” ,
Legs (wearily): “Prod, .prod prod!
Mother: “Is—is that Charley?”
Legs (glad to get off so easily, enthusiasti-
cally and with a hint of wonder how mother
guessed it, and a decided note of admira-
tion) : “ Prod! Pkod! PROD!”
And thereafter the alleged spook of the
absent Charley proceeds to pull all our legs,
including the table’s, with a circumstantial
yarn of how he got drowned in the last Lar-
won flood, in the real Charlemagne manner,
till he is bowled out and dismissed m dis-
grace —as he usually was.
After Charley a Norwegian spook enters
the table-legs, and father gets a look in.
Mother: “Who is it, Peter?”
Father : “It’s only my youngest brother.
Nils, that was drowned with the cargo of salt
we wrote home for and put the money
(Father wisely says “we” instead of ‘ you,
but that does not save him later on.)
About here I get a backhander tor al-
legedly aiding and abetting the Norse spook
(and, ‘incidentally, father) by pusliin’ or shoy-
in’ the table; and Fred gets a cuff from his
mother, just to show it’s all neighborly.
Mother: “He said more than that, 1 etei .
The more hesitation father seems to show
in translating the messages of Nils the
wilder mother gets ; but, fortunately for us,
though not always for her own peace ot
mind, she is a big woman in every nay,
and her keen appreciation of a good joke
especially against herself—mostly prevents
her from going to extremes.
“I. thought all your relations learnt Lng-
lish before thev left Norway,” says mother
to father; and at a mild suggestion from
father, and in deference to mother, the
spook of Nils drops into English and spells
“gun” and “wet.” It has commenced to
rain in the moonlight, and mother has a
brain-wave. She leads us into a skillion,
where a borrowed gun (borrowed on account
of a. lucky digger having left £BO in the
house in mother’s charge) is found to be
leaning under a leak. Father, who
ceptionally careful in,-the matter of boi-
rowed tools of all descriptions, sets that to
rights, and we return to the table, where
the spook of Nils Larsen laconically spells
out “late” as a hint -that it is time to
retire. .Dropping the table, Nils’s spook
itself retires, presumably to Valhalla, but
leaves a queer sound in father’s throat
something between a grunt and two snort
coughs, but so suspiciously like a British
cackle that mother closes the seance abruptly
and says “We’ve had enough of this sort ot
fooling for one night—and before the child-
ren, too.” And she’s sorry she ever allowed
father to introduce the rubbish into the
house. Which he never did. _ The neigh-
bor’s wife says, “You’re quite right, Louisa,”
and after a lending and a borrowing of the
family umbrella the neighbors separate.
A little later, I, from the “boys’ bed” in
the skillion, hear father try to start a con-
versation about the Vardoga, a Norwegian
fact or superstition, but is appealed to, “for
the last time,” not to be a bigger fool than
he can help, and is sent to see that the fire
is all right and the cat is out. And honest
slumber descends upon the old selection.
Four or fire Easters ago I sat writing
one last night at that self-same table, grown
sadly ricketty now. and there was a moon-
light shower, and all the old furniture
seemed straining and creaking and cracking,
with now and then a startling knock—rap-
ping messages from my boyhood and warn-
ings for the future.
So spirit-rappin’ went over the Moun-
tains by train to railhead, and then, fan-
like. through the western spurs by Cobb
and Co., by van, by two wheels, by pack-
horse and by pommel, and caught on and
was spread in every little gully, and faded

Have YOU Any
SKIN TROUBLE ?
For Eczema, Ringworm, Ulcers and Sores
Zam-Buk is the Best Healer.
THE manner in which Zam-Buk draws disease and poison out
of the skin has been aptly described as “magnetic.” Sores and
wounds are cleansed and soothed, and new healthy skin grown
in a way which is a positive revelation in the art of skin-healing.
Even obstinate and long-standing sores yield promptly to
Zam-Buk, for Zam-Buk has antiseptic and germicidal
properties that cannot be found in any other preparation.
The marvellous success of Zam-Buk is due to its herbal character and the
scientific methods employed m its blending, refinement and concentration.

Man’s Ulcerated Back
Perfectly Healed.
Mrs. Taylor, of 55 Egan Street, New-
town, Sydney, writes: —“Some years ago
my husband was injured by a fall which
affected the small of his back, and caused
the flesh to form into ulcers. For three
months he had to lay up absolutely help-
less. He went into two hospitals, but
the doctors could do nothing for him.
“As his back was getting worse I
thought it best to try other treatment, so
I got Zam-Buk. We soon realised that
Zam-Buk was taking the soreness and
inflammation out, and doing the ulcers
more real good than all else we had tried.
After perseverance with Zam-Buk for a
little over a month my husband’s back
was perfectly healed.”
Zam-Buk is -un-
surpassed for
cuts, burns,
bruises, scalds,
eczema, ulcers,
bad legs, piles.
poisoned
wounds, itching
inflamed spots,
sore feet, chafed
heels, and all
inju r e d and
diseased condi-
tions of the
skin.
°f simple, honest, hardworking, plain, rough-
living home circles, long vanished now.

r There was a woman who kept a pub in
York-street—the old Freemasons’ Hotel, I
think. She was a big, hard woman with a
hard face and a mouth like a steel trap;
a woman with big hard, bony hands, one
of which grabbed the cash while the other
reached for an empty tumbler. She was
a big, hard, bony woman altogether; and
her name was Mrs. Spooker, of all names
in the world.
I found out afterwards that she had been
a bush girl born and bred. If I had known
it before, this yarn would never have come
to be written, because there would have been
no yarn to write.
She had the name of being the hardest
publican in Sydney. She had never been
known to shout or "put up” a drink. They
said she claimed that one man owed her
for a drink, but they reckoned he had fluked
it somehow. They said she wouldn’t give
a drink to her own father, or his father
either, not even if the old gentleman’s boots
were hanging down to his tongue. That’s
how then pat it.
But, anyhow, one day my mates and I
made a bet that no one could make her shout
a beer, and Jack Jones, the hardcase of the
crowd, took on the job. After he’d bought
a round of beers, he got her to the ehd of
the bar and talked to her over it for a whije;
then he shouted another beer for himself.
We tried to get him away, as pre-arranged,
though we hadn’t known what for, but she
filled u>> our mugs, all round. Later on, when
we reckoned we must go, she shouted for us
again. We could have stayed there all
night, I .think; but it was after 11 now, and
we had take each other home to his wife,
and one tp his mother-in-law, and one to his
dad. So- she told us to come down to the,
kitchen —tt,' come quietly, for her old father
Was very liow and sleeping just then, in the
back-balcoiiy room, with a nurse watching
him; and rfhe’d let us out through the back
gate. We’d',noticed a very old man pottering
about the back verandah before; but no one
had thought to dream that it might be her
father. We saw the lighted window as we
came through, and the shadow of the nurse
on the blind. Jack Jones had stayed at the
hotel for a night or two before. It was an
old place with a wide yard behind, and part
of an old stable left: a big gate with a door
in it leading out into a lane. As we passed
through the\big. old, brick-floored kitchen we
noticed a pile of dirty crockery on the table,
and Jack thought to ask about a girl with a
kid that he’d seen there.
"She looked' tired and ill, poor girl, so I
sent her to bed early. I only took her in till
she got over her trouble and could do a bit to
help the cook. It’s the cook’s day out.”
Then she said: "It was a nice trick, Jack
.Tones, to play om a woman that was born in
your mother’s district; but never mind, it
wasn’t your fault! You never saw me before
and I wasn’t Mfis. Spooker then. Some day
T’ll tell you why? I’m down on ‘shouting.’
But I’ll forgive you for your father’s sake.
There’s four bottlels there on the dresser that
you boys can take home ; and now get out with
you—l must go up and have a look at
father, and then come down and wash up.”
As we passed on to tne gate, she swore,
under her breath, at the broken-down skele-
ton of an old cart-horse that stamped in the
bright moomigbt in one of the open stalls
that was left.
“It’s an old, broken-down horse that was
turned out,” she said. "He came in at the
gate one cold morning and I let him stay in
the old stall with a bit of straw and chaff,
lie’s very quiet usually and there isn’t much
to clean up after him.”
We were sobered and subdued and said
“Good-night, Mrs. Spooker,” in low voices as
we passed out through the gate. “Good-
night, boys,” she said. “Come again soon.”
It was a warm, still night, and we stood
outside the gate quite awhile, looking at the
ground, and smoking. Except Jack. He
looked at the ground and whistled softly to-
himself. Presently one of us asked:
“How did you get round her, Jack?”
“I knew her fad,” said Jack. “Or thought
I did.”
"Her what?”
“Her rat!” said Jack shortly, and it
seemed bitterly.
"And What was that?”
“Spirit-ripping,” said Jack! Then he eot
impatient. “Let’s get away out of this,” he
said.
“Why, are you frightened of the push?”
"No, but I seem to have heard the blessed
spirits rappin’ all the time we’ve been standing
here.” And so, at least, did one "ther of us.
It could not have been Mrs. Spooker closing
the gate, for she did it very softly. And it
couldn’t havq been the clatter of her hard
soles and heels across the brick-paved yard,
for she didn’t want to wake her father.
Tbos° big women can walk like cats when
they like. And it couldn’t have been the wash-
ing up, for we— her boys now—noticed later
that she could move about and wash up for
a hotel with not one-tenth of the clatter of
some young wives “washing up” cups and
saucers and plates for two. It may have
been the spirit of Mary Jane Hill, of Mudgee,
friend of the cleaned-out drover, unlucky
digger, broken-down newchum, drunk or sober,
good or bad : or the soirit of many another
of the great-hearted landladies of our father’s
time who had not been any better than they
should have been, yet were some of the best,
for all that.

“Betcherlife ”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MRS. GRAINGER had slipped me up.
There was nothing unusual about
that. She was supposed to come in
twice a week to wash and scrub, and twice
a week I optimistically soaked clothes or
stacked chairs in unsteady heaps and put
little tables upside down-on top of big tables.
And more often than not it ended in my

to be done. I went round to Mrs. Grainger’s
cottage and found she couldn’t see ’er ’and

mot her first \ f. l^. 3 * children. I saw her
SSSS heart * « 2* S? woman with a
ChrOnjC heait, as she told me. She was
dubious, but agreed to call Hada. She was
small, too, but not with the smallness
of a child. It was impossible to guess her
age. She might have been 16 or 26. There
was none of the softness of youth about her
face, but neither was there • any of the tired
resignation of the working-woman past her
youth. It was hard and purposeful and
alert. Her hair was dragged back from her
forehead and hung in a skimpy plait. But
so did her mother’s. Her skirt was not much
below her knees. But my own—well, you
couldn’t tell from that. ’ '
She stood in the doorway, quite silent and
noncommittal, while I talked.
“Where d’yer live.?” she asked, cutting
one of my sentences short.
I told her. I
“What’s the work yer want done?”
I told her that.
“Would an hour (from now do?”
It was so sudden I could hardly believe it.
“Oh, yes, nicely. You’ll come' then''*”

never been right since he come back from
the Front. Soimetimes he’d do a week’s work
an’ sometimes he’d be months only just get-
tin’ about. Good thing he had his pension
with nine of them an’ Mum’s heart an’
everything. .Mervyn an’ Reg were both
workin’, but it took all they earned to keep
’em. With their clothes an ; trams and foot-
ball clubs an’ pitchers. Yer know what boys
are.
“Don’t you care for the pictures?” I asked.
“Betcherlife! But I don't often get the
cbanct. Dad likes to take Mum; it brightens
her up. lou want something to brighten yer
up when yer gettin’ on, don’t yer?'’
I agreed you did.
“Well, yer see, that only leaves me to mind
the kids. We only have pitchers here twice
er week, yer know. The neighbors say put
’em to bed an’ they’ll look in now ’n’ then,
but I’m funny like that. I couldn’t enjoy
meself. Young Albert, he’s a fair terror
with lamps. He’d set afire to the place as
soon as yer back was turned.”
When Hada found that I had no objection
to her bringing two of the smallest children
with her she obliged more readily than ever.
They played in the yard while she washed
and scrubbed. With the two boys at work
and two more at school this left only two
for Mum to mind. “An’ quite enough when
yer haven’t got yer ’ealth, I promise yer,”
said Hada, nodding her head in italics.
A few months later I had an idea. Couldn’t
all the small children play in my yard as
well as in their own? And couldn’t they
do it for a few hours every day instead of
twice a week ? I asked Hada if it could be
managed.
“Betcherlife!” She was almost enthusi-
astic. “I could easy fix a bit of dinner for
Mum an’ Dad before I left. An’ I’d be back
in time to get the boys’ tea.”
So we tried it. It worked very well for
a couple of weeks. But one morning 10
o’clock came and no Hada. I was afraid it
was Mum’s heart, so I went to the cottage
to inquire. There was no cottage there, but
plenty of neighbors to tell me the story.
Mum and Dad had gone to the pitchers
the night before. And Hada was tired. Be-
sides doing my washing that day she had
done all their own and scrubbed the cottage.
So she put the children to bed and lay down
beside them. An’ must have drooped off.
Young Albert, the fair terror with lamps,
had wakened and made for the one on the
kitchen table. Most of the grown-ups in the
handful of bush cottages near by were at
the pictures. When Hada woke half suffo-
cated by the smoke the fibro cottage that
Dad had built before he went to the Front
was a sheet of flame. It wasn’t until she’d
finished her fourth journey and the kids were
all safe that Hada gave in. She was in the
hospital now, one burn from ’ead to foot, as
yo” might say.
Shedidn’t know me when I got there; but
a few days later she opened her eyes as I
came to the bed. The face and all the bodv
were bandaged. Only the eyes were show-
ing. Beneath the agony and the film of
the drugs that made the agony bearable I
saw a question—a fear and a longing.
“Some friends of mine have arranged for
a girl to live with your mother until the
children are older. Is that what you’d like?”
I asked.
The bandaged hand moved an inch nearer
mine. I stooped to hear the answer.
"Betcherlife!” whispered Hada, as into
the tortured eyes came a light that I guessed
Was her last smile.

FOUR Good Reasons
for Buying a
'■ V
Remington. .22
This repeating rifle is chambered to take
without adjustment the .22 short, long or
long-rifle cartridge.
The magazine holds 15 short or 11 long or
10 long-rifle cartridges. Ready for instant use.
After firing, just slide the fore-end back and
forward, which operation ejects the empty
case and passes a cartridge instantly from
the magazine into the chamber—and repeat.
May be taken apart without tools. The barrel,
therefore, may be cleaned from the breech.
The breech block is easily removed so that the
mechanism and bore can be kept in perfect
condition.

■)"
q In the annihilation of distance which motor cars
make possible, Oxy Acetylene Welding has played
no small part. The modem tractor also owes a
debt to the most remarkable metal fusing process of
the age. Likewise the plough, harvester, harrow-even
the common hand tools which litter the farm shed.
<1 Oxy Acetylene Welding has brought extraordi-
nary speed and homogeneity to the making or joining
of metal parts. Without this aid cars and agricul-
tural implements would cost more-would lack much
of their durability.
<S The healing action of COMOX (Oxy Acetylene)
Welding is perhaps more widely understood. Who
but the spendthrift motorist would buy new parts
to-day in the face of a broken or cracked gear case,
differential housing, axle or frame ?
C. Farmers get double, even treble, the life from
various implements by enlisting the aid of the local
COMOX Welder when machinery parts are broken
or worn. And the most amazing part of COMOX
is that these repairs, while saving priceless time, yet
cost a trifling him.
q If you manufacture metal articles, send for partic-
ulars of COMOX plants. If you don’t, then ask for
the name of the nearest COMOX Welaer.
