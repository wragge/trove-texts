CHILDREN AND CHINAMEN.
Introducing Nursery Rhymes for
Certain Times (Faber) Walter de 1& Mare
observes: — • \f
The story of “The Three Bears,” now a
nursery classic, is as recent as Robert
Southey, but in this if is a singular excep-
tion. And I can think not only of no
true-blue nursery rhyme that is less than
centuries old, but of no writer, living or
dead, except possibly Shakspeare, possibly
Skelton—not even, in the positive kind,
Lear or Carroll—who has proved himself
capable of adding to the classic list'. The
recipe has been mislaid or the cooks have
lost their skill.
De la Mare is perhaps too severe, for
some of his own rhymes for children are
likely enough to find their way on to the
“classic list.” But it remains true that to
write nursery rhymes of the proper magic
would be very difficult:
Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?
Silver bells and cockle-shells
And pretty maids all of a row.
A lot of people have tried to imitate
that sort of thing, but it can’t be done;
not convincingly ; not magically. Where-
as, with all due respect to the 500,000,000
inhabitants of China, the sort of poetry
in R. Ormsby Martin’s Shan Shui:
Translations of Chinese Landscape Poems
(Meanjin Press) really does not seem
beyond the capabilities of “child or pundit
or pedagogue” as De la Mare says
nursery rhymes are. Meng Hao-Jan, who
lived from a.d. 689 to 740, wrote:
Moving my boat, I moor by a misty island.
Sundown —and the traveller’s heart is sad again.
On every side, the sky hangs low over the trees;
A clear stream —a friendly moon.
And, charming though that is, it does
seem like a pleasant little bit of nothing
in particular that anybody could toss off
on the spur of the moment. For
instance:
l sit in my boat in the middle of Sydney
Harbor.
Moonlight; —and Uncle Billy is at the beer again.
On my left side is Potts Point and on my right
Cremorne,
Twinkling lights—Uncle Billy and the water
lapping.
If Uncle Billy seems too earthy a
character to figure in poetry, he is no
more reprehensible than Su Shi (also
known as Su Dung-Po), who, somewhere
between a.d. 103 b and 1101, recovered
for the delight of posterity:
I am an old man but unashamedly wear a
flower in my hair!
But the flower is ashamed for being on an old
man’s head.
On my return I am drunk and need some
support;
But ’twill amuse the passers-by.
Along the road people will peep at me through
half-raised blinds.
Possibly, though Ormsby Martin’s
translations are exquisite—quite as
attractive as any of Arthur Waley’s—
there is some untranslatable subtlety of
expression and technique in the originals,
and possibly Chinese audiences extracted
from their poetry a pleasure much the
same as we get from the simpler poems
of W. H. Davies or Shaw Neilson, John
Clare or the nursery rhymes. But that
is the measure of it: a simple and child-
like versification—and the point seems
worth making, for Chinese poetry, like
Oriental art generally, is often much over-
rated. It is an art of childhood—or
second childhood—fresh, charming,
minute. Where chiefly it fails short of
Western poetry is in architecture ; for if
you take one of the loveliest of these
translations, “Impressions at Dawn”;
A lonely candle companioning a wavering
dream —
The Jand of Chu, far out On the borders of
heaven!
A setting moon, a wailing cuckoo,
wild apricot flowers fill the courtyard....
and if you allow for the added grace the
poem might have in the original, it is
still a much slighter piece than the
nursery rhyme:
I had a little nut-tree,
Nothing would it bear
But a silver nutmeg
And a golden pear.
The King of Spain’s daughter
Came to visit me,
And all was because of
My little nut-tree.
I skipped over water,
I danced over sea, .
And all the birds in the air
Could not catch me.
One might, too, to correct any exag-
gerated valuation of the amiable Chinese
Muse, compare this oddment from a
contemporary Chinese writer:
Sitting silently, I ponder the present and past.
Burning incense, I read Gi Dji.
I weep sadly—
Country and time separate us
with the “Ode to a Nightingale” ; for
“Gi Dji,” according to Ormsby Martin’s
footnote, is the Chinese name for Keats.
It is worth noting again how subdued,
how lacking in passion is the best of
Chinese poetry. “Rain in the Night”;
Night rain dripping, empty steps,
Dripping, dripping on empty steps;
To the empty steps the dripping is naught—
Its meaning is for the ears of a sorrowing
man—
is an effective little touch of pathos;
more dignified, no doubt, than
Tell tale tit,
Your tongue shall be slit
And every little dog in town
Shall have a little bit —
but the nursery rhyme (a scrap of
childish fiendishness one is very glad to
re-encounter in the De la Mare book)
is very much more dramatic.
Read simply for its own sake Shan
Shui is wholly charming. It is a glimpse
of foreign fife; simple, pastoral, remote
yet strangely close to us: for the Chinese
poet of long ago had happy love and
unhappy love, liked birds and flowers
and rivers, went fishing and, as he
confesses with disarming frankness,
frequently got drunk.
The other book, a much larger volume,
and nicely timed for Christmas, is also
wholly delightful. It is a collection of
the “classic nursery rhymes”—all the old
favorites from “Baa, Baa, Black Sheep”
to “Wee Willie Winkie” —and was first
put together by Roger Ingpen and added
to by Mrs. Ingpen (De la Mare’s sister)
and Mary Grenside. There are drawings
by Elinor Darwin ; and Walter de la
Mare’s introduction, which avers that
nursery rhymes, though the best of them
mercifully refrain from moralising, must
be counted at least as edifying as “a daisy,
a snail, a butterfly or a tomtit.”
Lost England.
But for a general feature which they
all have most strikingly in common,
Margaret Sharpe’s Britannia Mews
(Collins), Beerbohm’s Mainly on the
Air (Heinemann) and Robert Henrey’s
The King of Brentford (Peter Davies),
recent English publications from Angus
and Robertson, would be best considered
as separate things, to be critically related
only to their own kind.
Britannia Mews is a novel, and quite a
good one; an interesting story set in in-
teresting surroundings in London, with
the action dating from about the Seven-
ties to the present day. It is in the core
the life-span of one woman, though a
few of her contemporaries see the distance
out, too. The novel’s strength lies mainly
in the author’s superb study of her central
character. It is an impressive example of
complete character development. Per-
haps one slight flaw in it is that the char-
acter, Adelaide, is never really young.
As a little girl she is a shade on the stiff
side. Even that, however, has a certain
merit. It states that, while the later shap-
ing and full realisation of Adelaide’s
character is very greatly influenced by
circumstances —her embittering marriage
to a weak and vicious drinker, her acci-
dental killing of him, her subsequent ris-
ing above her rough surroundings and
their changing and rising with her —the
quality of strength was there from the
beginning. Also, the author has a sound
grip of the changing periods of the action,
and, a test of tests, her men are men.
Mainly on the Air is, as the title sug-
gests, mainly broadcast talks; half a
dozen of them, with as many essays eke-
ing out the semblance of a thin whiff of
a book. In his talks the author several
times refers to himself as an old man,
but there is still a sparkle in his mind.
As literature, the talks—reminiscent of
the London he used to know, the old
music-halls and the like—have that fatal
defect apparently inseparable from broad-
cast chats, a certain thinness. Perhaps
that will be the final judgment on even
the author’s better work; pleasant enough
reading as that always was. Charming,
of course ; gentle in thought and graceful
in craftsmanship ; but shadowy Lamb.
In literary kind. The King of Brentford
comes in about midway between the other
two; an essayist using the technique of
the novelist. Here again there is the in-
cidental quality of charm that pervades
the other two, as it does so much English
writing. The author is possibly most
widely-known for The Incredible City
(London, of course), but A Farm in Nor-
mandy was an earlier one of unforget-
table quality. As well as the beauty of
prose style Robert Henrey’s work has a
measure of substance which so many
readable enough essayists lack. The latest
book deals thus essayishly with the place
of its title,- digressing backwards and
forwards from George 111 to the present;
a Thames-side vicarage setting, with a
faint suggestion of narrative, more like a
fragrance than a plot, to give the whole a
sort of fictional unity. The book is grace-
fully written throughout, and the first half
of it recaptures, beside the Thames, the
warm humanity and beauty of A Farm in
Normandy. Later it somewhat cloys.
The one feature common to all three
of these otherwise different books has no
doubt by now been noted: each of these
English authors looks back to another
England. What makes the common
feature distinct and noticeable is that
each of them looks back fondly, so that
the lost England they look back on,
though recent enough as time goes there,
seems in their nostalgic outlook hope-
lessly remote from today.
They relate it to a present England in
which none of them seems comfortable.
When the novelist comes on to the Lon-
don of the recent war the scene, though
still fairly well done, seems artificial com-
pared with the strong and convincing
reality of her lost London. The essayist-
cum-novelist is also incomparably better
in the past than in the present ; and Sir
Max, as politely as 8.8. C. would permit,
utterly damns the present and all its works
as he recalls what he would describe as
the pre-concrete era.
It is also to the point that at least two
of the three—Henrey and Beerbohm —
have preferred to live out of England:
one in France, the other in Italy.
The main feature the three books have
in common seems too close and definite
to be merely accidental or without signi-
ficance. The impression is that its
presence in all of them must have a
meaning; an impression which is not
lessened, but made all the more positive,
by their technical difference in kind.
Read as a batch, they are like sampling a
fairly representative literary expression of
prevailing English mood. If that is a
reasonable inference—and there are a
good many other current English books
to support it —the mood expressed is any-
thing but the desire of the moth for the
star. It is more like hibernating. It is the
present seeking protection from itself in
the warm old past. The moth is rather
the present, also unsatisfied with itself,
but striving to break through to the
future. This may be futile, but it is not
without faith and hope. When Australian
writers achieve that sort of awareness —
of the present looking towards the future
—Australia may have its Dickens ; and so
again, if it happens over there, should
England.
Australia has had something of a sur-
feit of obsession with the past, too ; but
there is a great difference, with perhaps
some hope in it. Oddly, here it has been
an obsession without fondness. An ob-
session with a family skeleton, and a
hateful and macabre one at that. So, at
any rate, the Australian past that has
been the staple of so much Australian
fiction seems to have been regarded. It
might be too much to say that the bulk
of the writers actually hated the past they
reconstructed, though most of them cer-
tainly seem to have regarded it with con-
siderable distaste, on superior grounds of
morality. What can hardly be felt of
any of them —except perhaps J. H. M.
Abbott—is that they are fond of it. That
might be all to the good. The vein of
hate should soon peter out; all the more
so because, actually, it is a very small
past. The near-present and the living
present looking towards the future may
be found to be far greater and corres-
pondingly more inspiring.
England’s past is so rich in color and
material that writing about it, to those
whose lives are part of its texture, must
be comparatively easy. It may be fatally
easy. To make a generalisation on
current English writing, it seems to be
lacking in strong vitality. It does not
suggest a quickening uprush of life. It
is a little faded. It seems due for rein-
vigorating. Australian writing, on the
other hand, may smack of rawness, but at
least there is vigor in it. It may have
been somewhat obsessed with a past, but
it is not immersed in fondness for that
past. It seems to have a future. There is
not much future in fond nostalgia.
Doctor Sawbones.
.Doctor Sawbones in a disused attic
Locked away a skeleton and lost the keys.
Giving no thought to the yellow bones
Through years •of collecting handsome
fees.
His nervous wife thought she heard dry
sounds
Coming sometimes from the top of the
house;
He’d shrug thin shoulders and call her
foolish —
“A board that creaks, or at most a
mouse."
For how should he know — respectable,
acid —
Of passion shaking what has long been
dead.
Or that abov « him raged this quarrel;
“Which ruled in life; the heart or the
head ?”
Dry ribs rattle right down the spine,
Skull rolls wildly with a fixed white leer;
“The delicate brain coiled in my cavities."
The ribs close round; “But the heart was
. here."
Thus they disputed for thirty years
Without cessation till the question
“How did he die?” asked the left big toe.
The skeleton shook at this new suggestion.
The ribs had no wish to take the blame,
The tough old skull pretended sleep,
But every other bone by now grown
curious
Whispered and wakened from its dusty
sleep.
Stirred by unaccustomed movement
Quivering with urgency to inquire—
“ What killed the flesh ?” sang the angry
chorus
Tugging at the old connecting wire.
Stiff joints moved as the wire parted ;
Unravelling slowly strand by strand ;
The skull rolled into a dingy corner
A yellow heap lay beneath the stand.
Mrs. Sawbones had a locksmith
Open the door and let her in
And she shivered at the bones but never
noticed
The skull in the corner with its nasty
grin.

NANCY KEESING.
A Boon to Dr. Bankoff.
Dr. George Bank off’s The Boon of the
Atom (Faber), a medical man’s defence
of atomic research, is not on the whole
as reconciliatory as the author hopes it
will be. By putting the atom itself “on
trial,” arguing the case for it with much
enthusiasm and the ease against it with
less, he is able to prove to his own satis-
faction something that nobody has ever
had the slightest doubt about: that the
atom itself, as such, is “not inherently
evil.”
Nobody ever thought that the atom
itself was “evil” ; though a lot of people
—and these are the ones Dr. Bankoff
should have tried to contend with—rdo
think, and with reason, that the atom
bomb is a menace to the whole life of
man on the earth ; and, consequently, it
is not easy to applaud its invention.
Dr. Bankoff does to some extent
attempt to answer this point of view;
arguing that—since the X-ray and the
discovery of radium may be counted as
steps in the investigation of the atom —
the great benefit to humanity from X-ray
diagnosis and ray treatment of cancer
should be weighed against the destruction
at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But his
argument here ignores the potential
menace of the bomb. Possibly, as things
stand, the good and evil of atomic re-
search are balanced; but if civilisation
were wiped out by the atom bomb one
could hardly—presuming one survived —
feel that the benefits to medical science
would outweigh the universal disaster.
Dr. Bankoff argues that primitive man
would have felt the same about the “dis-
covery” of fire as modern man does about
the atom bomb. Except among the
artists most boosted by Sydney news-
papers the present commentator does not
know any primitive men ; but if primi-
tive man did think his whole world was
going to be blown up or burnt to bits be-
cause a campfire could set a forest alight,
then he was quite as much of a noodle
as primitive art would suggest. But prob-
ably the reverse was the truth; he wel-
comed fire, because he could warm his
hands and his heart at it. It is difficult
to sit down and warm your heart at an
atom bomb.
Finally Dr. Bankoff declares “The
forces of Nature are blind, needing direc-
tion.” To which the answer is that the
forces of nature created the whole uni-
verse, including Dr. Bankoff, and, in spite
of an occasional earthquake, have got
along pretty well for quite a long time.
It may not be “direction” that Nature
needs, but freedom from impertinent in-
terference. It is man that needs direc-
tion.
However, one must agree with Dr.
Bankoff that atomic research can’t be
stopped ; that it may lead to very useful
and interesting results, not only those
medical benefits which are Dr. Bankoff’s
immediate concern, but Cook’s tours to
the moon; that it is, in fact, a Good
Thing—as long as it doesn’t blow the
whole lot iof us sky-high; and that
whether or not it does blow us all up de-
pends on whether mankind can outgrow
the habit of war.
Read for its facts rather than its argu-
ments —which, if stimulating, are madden-
ing—The Boon of the Atom is an inter-
esting little volume, written with remark-
able clarity. Since there are no diagrams,
no mathematical formulae and no techni-
cal jargon the average reader will have
no need to bunk off from Dr. Bankoff.

Information Sought.
I have a Japanese sword with the name
Masatsune marked on it; could you Supply
some information about this maker and other
early sword manufacturers?
There were three outstanding families who
specialised in this work and each had a record
reaching back through the centuries. These
were Yoshimitsu, Masamune and Yoshihiro.
All three lived in Kyoto, the old capital. In
the early 17th century another name appears,
that of Munetada, of Sano, near Yedo (Tokyo).
The Kyoto swordmakers attempted to force
the Munetada clan out of business because it
had imitated the Masamune style. There was
a long political struggle over it and eventually
a compromise was reached, and the Munetada
family agreed to fashion a new model and
change its name to Masatsune. This name
appears on all subsequent official lists. Masat-
sune swords have been made for some hun-
dreds of years, but Dr. W. G. Goddard has
expressed the opinion that your sword is quite
modem, as several of the characters on it
suggest.

How would the earth appear viewed from
other planets? Would it be a shining body
or not ?
It would appear much like any other planet
does to us. If Mars were inhabited, the
Martians would see the earth much as we see
their planet except that we, being of greater
magnitude, would appear bigger. As our
illumination is only borrowed from the sun,
our brightness would vary according to the area
of illumined ‘surface presented to the observer,
just as the moon or Venus varies to us from
a thin crescent of light to the full circle, de-
pendent on the relative positions of earth,
sun and observer.

What is cloisonne-ware and whefe is it made?
If is a kind of decorated enamel-ware. The
design is first drawn on metal and worked
in gold, silver or copper wire secured to the
metal with a special gum. The whole is then
clayed over so that the wire is flush with the
surface and the design is colored, after which
it is burnt ahd painted in turn, three times.
The surface is finally smoothed with a stone,
or the whole may be melted into glass (vitrified)
in a furnace. Cloisonne-ware is made both
in China and Japan, the article taking the form
of vases, bowls and small ornaments.

Origin of the Union Jack?
In the Middle Ages the' English armies
fought under the red cross of St. George in
a white field as the sovereign’s banner. In
1707 the white diagonal cross of St. Andrew
was added consequent upon the union with
Scotland, and in 1801 the red diagonal cross
of St. Patrick was added to the first two to
form the Great Union or Union Jack.

In John Masefield’s “Spanish Waters ” there
is mention of “pots of' old Arica bronze” and
of “bezoar stones from Gayaguil.” What is
referred to ?
Old bronzes of the Inoas of Peru came from
Arica. Bezoar derives from two Persian words
meaning counter-poison, or antidote. It is a
concretion or ball, caused by indigestion, some-
times found in the stomachs of goats or
antelopes, and in olden times imagined to
have medicinal properties, for poisoning in par-
ticular.

How to prevent and cure sandfly bites?
Smear exposed parts with strong solution of
Epsom salts. To alleviate irritation when bitten
apply a lotion of equal parts liquid ammonia
and witch-hazel, freely asT required. A tepid
soda-bath at night is of value. Citronella or
lavender oil is the usual preventive application
to ward off insect pests.

What is the “Index Liborum Prohibitorunt”?
What is its history, and how is it compiled?
It is the title of a list of books prohibited
by the Roman Catholic Church on doctrinal
or moral grounds. The origin of ecclesiastical
prohibition dates from a very early period in
church history; the earliest known instance is
a catalogue of forbidden apocryphal works issued
by Pope Gelasius (494). What may be regarded
as the first Roman Index was published by
Pope Paul V (1557-59). All books considered
pernicious and all versions of the Bible by
unauthorised persons are placed on the Index
by the Congregation of the Holy Office.

How to remove the glassy surface of a green
concrete tennis court?
Take 21b. commercial spirits of soda and
add water to make one gallon. Swab the
solution on the concrete and allow it to re-
main until effervescence has ceased. The con-
crete should then be thoroughly washed with
a hose. This treatment, which can be repeated
frequently, will give any desired degree of
roughness. It is advisable to feel the surface
of the concrete with the fingers after each wash-
ing so as not to carry the treatment too far.

Thrilling Incident in Space.
’Twas the month of May
When a fierce monsoon
Through the horizon swept
During the afternoon.

Against the monsoon

After a perilous flight
O’er the splashing surf
The airmen descended
To mother earth.

The Liquor Act provides that with 10 o’clock
closing hotels will be open between 10 a.m.
and 6.30 p.m., and between 7.30 p.m. and
10 p.m—serving of liquor being prohibited
in either lounges or bars between 6.30 p.m.
and 7.30 p.m. This means that liquor will be
sold for eleven hours each day, or one hour
less than the twelve hours allowed under the
previous 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. regulations.
Thus 10 o’clock closing is not a move for
longer trading hours, but for hours that will
better serve the requirements of the general
public. Ten o’clock closing will mean that it
will be possible to enjoy a drink in comfort at
whatever reasonable time suits you best; it
will mean the provision of conditions con-
ducive to moderate, leisurely and civilised
drinking; it will bring N.S.W. into line with
conditions enjoyed in almost every other
country and several Australian States; and it
will remove an outdated, unpopular and
unnecessary restriction on our freedom.

By Roderick Finlayson
COMING from the Tidal Creek
store Jake cute across the back
' paddock and walks through the
shelterbelt of pines that Uncle Ted
planted a few years ago. He’s hidden
among the low bushy pines, but he can
easily see out across the paddock. And
in the middle of the paddock, leaning on
the handle of the mattock with which
he had been" rather lackadaisically grub-
bing thistles, is Uncle Ted with a stranger
in a dark felt hat and a long fawn
mackintosh, a leather bag at his feet.
Jake stands, just hidden by the outer
row of pines, and watches the two men.
Ife’s not in the mood for meeting people,
especially strangers. How could his
mother send him a letter addressing him
as “Master,” instead of “Mr.”? And the
storekeeper reading the address out in
front of everyone and making a silly joke
about not being twenty-one yet. He had
stuffed the letter in his pocket and walked
out with casual dignity.
Surely this man in the mackintosh
will go soon. He’s only a salesman of
some sort, Jake reckons. But, as he
waits and watches, Jake begins to feel
that there’s something just a little queer
about this business.
The stranger is gesticulating with a
long mackintosh-covered arm. He waves
it disparagingly over
the thistly paddock,
then points ungently
to the sky. He peers
closely at Uncle Ted
while he pounds one
open hand with the
other clenched fist.
Uncle Ted stands un-
easily resting on the
mattock, looking
down at his feet
most of the time as
though he’s embar-
rassed by the man’s close-thrust face.
Now and then he nods, slowly and hesi-
tantly. Is he agreeing with the man, or
just too bemused to contradict?
'T HE stranger swoops to his bag and
I picks up a small package. He shakes
it convincingly near Uncle Ted’s nose,*
flings out an impatient arm, and then
thrusts the package into the bag again,
at the same time bringing out a large
sheet of paper or light card. This he
stretches taut beneath Uncle Ted’s slow
gaze, then as quickly rolls it into a tight
roll and hands it to Uncle Ted, who takes
it with a wondering, slightly grateful air
and holds it awkwardly in one huge
grubby hand,
Jake wonders what it can be. But
even more he wonders when the chap
will go. He’s tired of waiting in the cold
draught under the pines. Aha, the bloke
must have finished gassing now, he’s
snapping shut his black leather bag.
Jake is just about to step out from
among the trees when a surprising thing
happens. Placing his hand lightly on
Uncle Ted’s shoulder the stranger leans
toward him and whispers earnestly.
Obediently Uncle Ted bows his head low
over his hands, one qlutching the long
white roll and clasped on the mattock
handle, while the stranger, his own head
now thrown back, his eyes closed to
the sky, extends both arms high above
Uncle Ted’s head and raises his voice
in an oratorical but unintelligible drone.
You’d almost think. that he was praying
over or blessing Uriclp Ted. It can’t be
that, of course. People don’t do such
things in cowpaddocks—especially not
salesmen. It must be some new trick of
psychological high-pressure salesmanship.
And then Jake catches a word or two.
“.. .the blessing of Our Lord.. .Father,
Son and Holy Ghost.”
Goslri Hie is blessing Uncle Ted after
all. It s unbelievable. Right in the
middle of his cowpaddock!
When he looks again the man has
shrugged back into his plain business-
like mackintosh. He’s picking up his
bag, shaking Uncle Ted’s hand briskly,
and setting off over the paddock toward
the road gate almost at a jog-trot as
though he’s wasted too much time here
already.
Uncle Ted stares mildly after him,
looks at the roll in hand, looks at the
overcast sky, then vaguely around the
paddock. Finally he stuffs the paper roll
into his hip pocket, takes up the mattock,
and slowly and thoughtfully begins to
grub out thistles again.
Jake moves away in the shelter of the
pines so as to reach the house by a
roundabout route. He doesn’t want to
have to admit that he watched that
amazing scene. At the same time he’s
burning with curiosity. He reckons he
can say casually at tea-time, “Who was
that man with the bag I saw going out
the front gate today, Uncle Ted?”
When at tea-time Jake does ask the
question Uncle Ted says, “Oh, that was a
cattle-lick salesman. I didn’t take any of
his stuff. He said it was' full of minerals
and things. Well, I always reckon a
bit of rock-salt’s all right, but these patent
mixtures you don’t know what you’re
getting.”
“Cattle-lick?” says Jake, thinking of
the surprising benediction.
Uncle Ted only grunts.
“So he didn’t leave anything,” says
Jake, probing hopefully.
“Of course not—when I didn’t buy
none,” Uncle Ted says.
“And he only had cattle-lick?” says
Jake, staring disbelievingly.
Uncle Ted just giv6s him a look.
NEXT day there’s a new calendar
hanging on the wall by the bleary
looking-glass. In big blue letters it says
BIBLE CALENDAR, and there’s a
colored picture of Our Lord, surrounded
by a bright light, knocking at a closed
door. Below are the days of the month
and scripture texts. And in black letters
WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF
THE KOLL KATTLE-LICK CO.
“Oh, where did you get that, Uncle
Ted?” Jake asks.
“Cattle-lick man give it to me, of
course,” says Uncle Ted, going out.
“Can’t you read?”
A day or two later Uncle Ted brings
a bag of rock-salt from the store and
puts a big reddish-veined lump of it in
a box out in the cowpaddock. Jake licks
his finger, rubs it on the rough glassy
lump, and tastes it, “Just like salt,” he
says.
“Of course. It is salt,” says Uncle Ted.
“Perhaps the cows need a bit of a lick,
Jake. See how they’re chewing sticks
and other trash lately. That shows.
That man the other day reckoned they
needed something.”
“Why didn’t you try his stuff?” Jake
asks.
“At twice the price of this honest-to-
goodness salt? Not on your life,” says
Uncle Ted.
The next night Uncle Ted is moody
and spends a lot of time after supper
gazing at the Bible picture.
“That man was quite worried about
the look of this place,” he drawls after
a long silence, “Reckoned it’s going all
to the pack. Said it needs livening up.”
“Well,” says Jake, “you know you’re
not doing the cultivating you used to do,
Uncle Ted.”
Uncle Ted grunts.
“Does he know a lot about farming.
Uncle Ted?”
“Seems he knows a lot about a lot of
things,” says Uncle Ted.
“Oh?” says Jake. But Uncle Ted,
looking steadily at the picture of Our
Lord, says no more.
Until a few days later. “I been think-
ing over what that preacher said,” says
Uncle Ted.
“What preacher?”
“The man what give me that, of
course,” says Uncle Ted crossly, with a
nod at the Bible Calendar.
“Oh, so he was a preacher,” says Jake.
“I thought he was a cattle-lick man.”
Uncle Ted gives him a look. “Didn’t
I tell you?” he snaps. “Well,” he goes
on, “I reckon I’ll go to church next
Sunday. Nothing prospers if you’re a
heathen. Beasts sicken, land dies and
everything.”
“Did he say that?” asks Jake.
“/ say so,” Uncle Ted declares in-
dignantly.
“Next Sunday,” says Uncle Ted, taking
no more notice of Jake but running his
finger along the line of Sunday dates on
the Bible Calendar, “next Sunday will
be the third Sunday of the month. That’s
all right. Second Sunday every month
is the hell-fire preacher. Want to look
out and miss him .”
“Yes, I know,” says Jake. “You don’t
want to have to be ‘saved’.”
“Yes,” says Uncle Ted absentmindedly,
“this calendar’s real handy. The man
told me he goes about selling cattle-lick
so he can get around with these Bible
Calendars and tracts. Know what he
said to me? He said, T see you’re mighty
worried, brother.’ And he said there’s
a way to be shut of all your troubles.
Easy to tell he’s a preacher, I might give
him a bit of an order if he comes again.”
“Are you sure he doesn’t go round
preaching and pretending so he can get
sales for his cattle-lick stuff?” says Jake.
Uncle Ted sniffs. “You see I got the
calendar —free for nothing. He didn’t
sell me any lick.”
Well, thinks Jake, give Uncle Ted long
enough and at last everything comes out.
NEXT Sunday Uncle Ted and Jake
go to church. Uncle Ted seems
pleased to have an excuse to go again ;
as if he reckons he’ll be able to live down
his disgrace after that notorious circus
adventure.
“It’s like good old times,” he says
cheerfully as they spin along behind the
smart little pony. The brisk drive to
church is really nice. The day is sunny
and peaceful like a Sunday shrould be,
“I see George Hay croft’s cows are go-
ing off condition properly,” says Uncle
Ted as they bowl past George’s place.
“My herd’s not so bad, eh?” he says
with great satisfaction.
A little later he remarked pleasantly,
“Look at the buttercup getting away on
Tubby Trotter’s place. Sign of lazy farm-
ing. Never did have any buttercup on my
farm.”
They pass Bill Woller’s place, where
Bill is out having a look at his poor
“take” of turnips, and they comedo the
church.
“There’s old Jenkins’s turnout,” says
Uncle Ted, nodding toward a dilapidated
sulky under a tree with a piebald nag
hitched near by. “Didn’t know him be-
fore to come to the parson’s sermons.” .
As they awkwardly take off their hats
in the porch of the little white wooden
church, and stretch their necks in their
tight collars, and clear their throats and
prepare to enter. Uncle Ted whispers,
“Funny thing, Jake, there’s lots of folk
among the congregation today that don’t
usually ever come to hear Mr. Coakes.”
They’re late and take only a hurried
glance before tiptoeing creakingly to a
bench near the front. The back benches
always fill up first. The half-grown young
men and women come early to get the
very back one, where they giggle and
whisper and shuffle with bent heads and
red faces. The rest of the congregation
is composed largely of women wearing
hats of mothball-scented velvets and
nightmarish shapes. They sit bolt upright
and snatch swift stares at each other’s
hats.
Out comes young faded Miss Bett to
play the harmonium,
“Funny,” whispers Uncle Ted, “Miss
Bett turning out for Mr. Coakes. She
never would play for nobody but the old
hellfire Johnny.”
“Yes,” Jake mumbles, “just what I was
thinking.”
“This is the third Sunday of the
month,” says Uncle Ted uncertainly.
“Well,” says Jake, “didn’t the calendar
say so?”
Uncle Ted says no more. They fix
their eyes on the vestry door. The
harmonium wheezes violently trying to
burst into a triumphal march. The vestry
door opens an inch or two as if someone
is peering through the slit, it trembles
once or twice, and then is thrown wide.
With his well-known confident hoppety-
poppety walk out marches Mr. Keer, the
hellfire folk’s prophet.
Jake wonders
if, with a show of
dignity, they
could rise and
escape before it’s
too late. If he
could pretend to
be ill —or Uncle
Ted feel faint.
Judging by Uncle
Ted’s throat-
clearing and the
scraping and
squeaking of his
boots he’s pretty
agitated, too. But
Mr. Keer’s sud-
de n fascinating
gaze fixes full on
the two “stran-
gers,” and the feel of a score of
pairs of eyes boring into the back of
their heads paralyses and traps them there
in the front seat. And the service com-
mences.
Uncle Ted and Jake drone their way
through a familiar hymn that they find
now quite joyless, they bend uncomfort-
ably under prayers that seem outpourings
of their own self-pity. But not much time
is wasted on such trifles. Mr. Keer is
fidgeting to come to grips with his favor-
ite subject—the subjecf that, as he prays.
Uncle Ted pleads with God to keep Mr.
Keer from.
4i NJ dear brethren,” says Mr.
1 N Keer, patting the Bible open near
the end pages and leaning eagerly for-
ward over it, “now we come to that part
of the Book of Revelation recording the
signs of the Beast and the awful judg-
ments upon the Beast’s sinful followers.
Are you sure, dear friend, that you shall

WHAT BALANCE BETWEEN ARAB AND JEW?
The problem of Palestine is as far as
ever from solution. The London confer-
ence achieved nothing more than an in-
complete statement of views—only the
British and the Arabs were represented—
and was then postponed until mid-De-
cember, apparently in the hope that time
might allow feelings to simmer down. Re-
newed Jewish terrorism and threats
can only have the effect. of horrifying
people throughout the world whose
patience and sympathy have been worn
thin. There has been a new boiling of
discussion, all without new result. There
seems no way out of stalemate.
Arthur Koestler, writing from London
for the N.Y. ‘Times,” says that “if Jews
and Arabs submitted their case to an ob-
jective Judge the only fair decision he
could reach would be to shoot himself.
Both cases are unanswerable.”
He thinks that “if the Jewish case were
based merely on legal niceties it would
not differ much from the claim to the
pound of flesh,” and points out that
“the Arabs argue that to promise the
country in which they live to an alien
race was contrary to the principle of
self-determination.; and whether this
promise was signed by one nation or 52
they won’t accept it.”
“However,” says Koestler, “if in 1918
the Jewish claim to Palestine was merely
based on promises, by 1938 it was based
on achievements; the resurrection of a
country dead for more than a thousand
years. The home which the Jews built
was not taken from the Arabs bat built
on ground which was forme) ly unin-
habited desert, malaria-infested swamps
or barren sand dunes. There is no more
striking comparison than that between
Palestine and the neighboring Arab
countries—Syria, Transjordan, Irak —
which all started in 1918 from roughly
the same level. The barren land on which
the Jews built was acquired from the
native owners with their free consent.
The prices paid were many times the
land’s value because the Jews had no
choice but to buy. While pioneers from
Eastern Europe drained the marshes and
built collective settlements in the desert,
paying a high toll to malaria and typhus,
the money poured into the country by
the Zionist institutions benefited Arabs
as well as Jews —partly through the chan-
nel of taxes paid to the Government and
expended by Government on the Arab
sector and partly by going direct to
Arabs.
“However strongly we may sympathise
with the Arabs cramped by alien immi-
gration in their own country, this could
never have happened without the conni-
vance of Arabs themselves, who, while
they made voluminous protests against
the foreign infiltrators, at the same time
sold them land and thrived on the profits
and were able in 20 years to double their
population* which had been stagnant for
centuries.”
Given all that in Koestler is yet of the
opinion that “the Arab answer is never-
theless unanswerable.” It could, he says,
be given by an Arab in these words:
“I care not whether they pay, and I care
not for their hospitals and their schools.
This is our country. We want no foreign
benefactors. We want not to be patronised.
We want to be left alone. We want to
live our own way and we want no foreign
teachers and no foreign money and no
foreign habits and no smiles of condescen-
sion and no pats on the shoulder and
no arrogance and no shameless women with
wriggling buttocks in our holy places.
“We want not their honey and we want
not their sting. If they are thrown out
in other countries —very bad, very sorry,
but not our business. If they want to come
here—a few of them — TFaddal, welcome.
But they know they are guests and know
how to behave. Otherwise —to the devil.
Into the sea—finished.”
Koestler points out that “it is no longer
a question whether Zionism is a good
idea or a bad idea, whether it is desir-
able or not —the 600,000 Jews of Pales-
tine are no longer a political theory but
a fact; they occupy a compact portion
of the land and, though numerically still
outnumbered by the Arabs, they are, in
military strength and economic organisa-
tion, the senior partners in that unhappy
concern. They are, furthermore, rapidly
becoming the most important single
political factor in the Middle East.”
He favors a plan for the partition of
Palestine: “The difference between the
dilemma which faced King Solomon and
the one facing the arbiter in the Arab-
Hebrew issue is that, at the suggestion of
cutting the baby into two, both prospec-
tive mothers protest. But there is a
further difference: this monstrous baby
has two heads and two pairs of legs
straining in opposite directions. Unlike
—Manchester “Union.”
THE UNHOLY THREE.
the one presented to Solomon, its only
chance to live is to be halved by a surgi-
cal operation.”
Kermit Roosevelt, on the other hand,
believes that partitioning the country
could lead only to further bloodshed and
eventual civil war. In an article for
“Harper’s Magazine” under the title “The
Arabs Live There Too” he says “the
Zionist cause is, for many Jews, the
central faith of their lives, for which they
will fight and die; to many still in
Europe it offers their only hope. This we
are not likely to forget, even if the head-
fines would permit us. Another fact less
widely recognised is that the Arabs also
have rights in Palestine, that the Zionist
programme threatens those rights and
that Arabs also will fight and die in their
own cause.
“It is difficult,” says Roosevelt, “to
answer the Arabs when they say: ‘You
Americans talk of protecting minority
rights. Does that mean a majority is to
be trampled on, made a minority against
its will in its own home? You speak of
self-determination of peoples and regions,
of free elections and democracy. Is
Palestine not to have the right of self-
determination? Why not let us have a
free election on the destiny of our own
country? Why should not we be allowed
to decide our future in a democratic
way? And isn’t it strange that, in spite
of all your expressions of horror at Nazi
persecution of the Jews and all your
professions of pity and desire to help
you and other countries with space to
spare should not be willing to accept
your share of these refugees instead of
demanding that one small country bear
almost the entire burden?
“The Arabs were not responsible for
the persecution which has led to this
emigration. They argue that it is not just
that they should be compelled to pay for
the sins of others by opening their
country to hundreds of thousands of
sufferers from European anti-Semitism.
They would do their share for refugees
on a quota basis if other and bigger
countries did likewise. But to ask them
to bear the whole burden is, they pro-
test, a mockery of justice. Sympathy for
a wronged people does nof justify wrong-
ing another people. It is not just to force
the majority of the inhabitants of a
country to accept a large-scale immigra-
tion which would leave them out-
numbered in their own home. The ethnic
principle which we are upholding so
vigorously against the Yugoslavs and
Russians in Trieste would be grossly
violated by such- action ”
Roosevelt finds it “heartrending to
read how a large percentage of the tor-
mented Jews of Europe wish to go to
Palestine. Unless agreement can be
reached with the Arabs it is plain that
Palestine offers no solution to their bitter
quandary. Their prospects for happiness,
peace and security in a country torn by
civil war arising from their presence,
surrounded on all sides by hostile neigh-
bors, would be small indeed.”
Yet there is, he believes, “a way in
which they could attain such sanctuary
as they seek —at a sacrifice. That sacri-
fice would be renunciation of the idea
that Palestine shall ever become a Jewish
State and agreement that future immigra-
tion, after the admission of a specified
number, shall be held to a reasonable
quota. The sacrifice would be a severe
one to many Zionists; but no solution
is in sight Which does not entail as great
or greater sacrifice.
“The Balfour Declaration and the
League of Nations Mandate made sweep-
ing promises to the Jews concerning
Palestine. Even though both exceeded —
in the eyes of the Arabs and of many
impartial observers —their proper juris-
diction, and even though neither can
• possibly be regarded as legally binding
on the Arabs, that is certainly not the
fault of the Jews. The Zionists do have,
shall we say, not legal rights but legiti-
mate expectations in Palestine. At the
moment, however, they are trying to
press beyond what they were promised,
and in so doing they can only endanger
their expectations. The report of the
Committee of Inquiry on Palestine re-
marks; ‘The demand for a Jewish State
goes beyond the obligations of either the
Balfour Declaration or the Mandate, and
was expressly disowned by the Chairman
of the Jewish Agency as late as 1932.’
It is that expressed intention, which Arab
leaders had long prophesied, that causes
the most acute fear and arouses the most
intense hatred among the Arab peoples.
The abandonment »of that ambition does
not represent any paring down Of the
Jews’ legitimate expectations, but rather
a return to the original programme.
“Arrangements must be made by agree-
ment with the Arabs, which would be a
radical break with past methods of trying
to solve the Palestine problem. Surely
that is only practical; it is also the only
just way of proceeding. Arab rights
must be recognised. But, we must ask,
will the Arabs, let alone the Jews, agree
to such proposals?”
Roosevelt thinks that there is a good
chance that they will, “as a necessary
part of the following programme:
“Immediately upon their agreement,
the-way should be opened for Palestine
to become an independent State, a mem-
ber of the Arab Federation and of the
United Nations. It would have an Arab
majority, but the rights of the Jewish
minority should be carefully protected
under a U.N. guarantee, with local self-
government where practicable and full
participation in the national government
assured. Work on a constitution could
be started immediately.”
On these terms Roosevelt believes “most
Arabs would agree to a generous, firmly
fixed figure for emergency immigration.
They would be getting the two things
they most want: independence, and the
assurance of retaining a majority in their
own country. The Jews, on the other
hand, would be getting substantially what
they were promised by the Balfour De-
claration and the League mandate, and
far more than was recommended in two
subsequent British White Papers (which
are, in spite of the calumny heaped upon
them, fair and competent studies). Most
Jews would agree, I think, to relinquish
the idea of a Jewish State and accept
restrictions on immigration in return for
homes for their European homeless —
provided it Is clear that American and
British public opinion supports such a
programme and no further expansion
of earlier promises will be countenanced.
\ “The plan undoubtedly has flaws in it.
t will not be wholly acceptable, or even
nearly so, to either side. Unfortunately,
no plan can be. This particular one is
put forward with the conviction that up
to now American proposals have given
only the scantiest consideration to the
Arabs, and in the belief that a comprom-
ise of this general sort is not only pos-
sible but—in the light of past confusion
and present tragedy—is about the best
we can do. And something must be
done. Inaction will lead to chaos in the
refugee camps of Europe, in Palestine
and subsequently, in all likelihood,
throughout the greater part of the Middle
East. To support the Zionist programme
in its present form (as we seem inclined
to do) will inevitably lead to a tragedy
on the same scale as that the Jews have
suffered in Europe during the last decade.
Only by taking account of Arab as well
as Jewish rights can we reach a solution
that will work.”

Where Are the Armies?
The suggestion made originally in the
Security Council of U.N.O. by Russia’s
M. Gromyko that the nations be asked
to report on the strength of any military
forces they might have on non-enemy
soil, and carried further by suggestion
and innuendo, was allowed to fade when
it appeared there might be a widening of
the “accounting” to take in the strength
of armed forces anywhere throughout the
world—in Germany and in the Russian
homeland and spread through the smaller
States which have been incorporated as
Russian satellites! It was immediately
obvious that that information the Rus-
sians would not readily disclose.
Chicago “Tribune” remarked that the
trouble with M. Gromyko’s resolution
was that it did not go far enough;
Armies of occupation were excepted and
so were forces held in the homeland. All
should be included. He wants the U.S.
to tell flow many soldiers it has in Iceland,
China and other foreign countries, and he
wants the British to tell how many they
have in Greece, India, etc., but he doesn’t
want to report how many his country has
in Austria, Germany, Hungary and a lot
of other places; and he doesn’t want to
announce the full military strength of his
country.
M. Gromyko’s theory is that the pre-
sence of alien troops on friendly foreign
soil is the only proof of a lack of peaceful
intentions on the part of the country from
which they come. It is neither the only proof
nor even the best test. The strength of the
Red Army in Bulgaria, an enemy country,
is quite as significant for the peace of the
world as the strength of the British Army
in Greece. No one can make an accurate
appraisal of warlike intentions who doesn’t
know the relative strengths of the armies of
occupation in Germany, Austria and the
other enemy countries where 90 per cent,
of the occupying forces today are superflu-
ous if the purpose is merely one of main-
taining order and military control. The
armies of occupation are watching not the
Germans but each other. The massing
of troops in and close behind the enemy
and satellite countries which now constitute
the frontier between East and West is a
much more direct threat to peace.
And N. Y. “Times” pointed out that
by M. Gromyko’s criterion
it would not b'e at all necessary for Russia
to report on the enormous forces she still
maintains in Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary
and Austria, consuming what fat there is
in the lands of these small countries,
maintaining with armed force the puppet
Governments which Russia has imposed on
most of them, and making practically all
of eastern Europe a closed sphere of
Russian influence behind §in iron curtain.
Nor is there the slightest likelihood that
Russia would feel it necessary to report
how many troops she has now in Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia —though these are
not in any sense “former enemy ter- ,
ritories,” but rather once-independent little
Baltic republics which Russia now regards
as part of Russia. No, M. Gromyko
is not thinking about the Baltic or the
Balkans —except that part of the Balkans
which is Greece. An attack on the presence
of British troops in Greece, and the presence
of American troops in China, is obviously
the objective of his questionnaire; though
British troops went into Greece with the
approval of an all-party Greek Govern-
ment and though American troops are in
China with the full consent of the Gov-
ernment which Russia too has recognised
by treaty.
The curious but certainly not unintended
result of M. Gromyko’s questionnaire would
be a clean slate for Russia, which has
annexed 270,000 square miles of territory
as a consequence of the war, while putting
the U.S. and Britain, which have annexed
nothing, in the dock.
Later Hanson W. Baldwin sent to the
N. Y, “Times” a review of the situation
of the armies of the Powers as nearly as
he could discover them.
“Any world ‘order of battle’ today,”
he pointed out, “must be largely
estimate and sometimes ‘guesstimate, 5
for none of the Great Powers has
completely relaxed its war-time secrecy;
Russia, in particular, uses troop concen-
trations and dispositions in her political
and psychological war of nerves, and
hence sometimes tries deliberately to ex-
aggerate or to minimise her strengths in
certain areas. The troop concentrations,
however, give some clue to occupation
policies and to political aims, and in
some areas the military forces are shap-
ing, or helping to shape, the political
future.
Russian Forces
“Russian forces inside and outside the
Soviet number between 4,500,000 and
5.300.000 men. Demobilisation from the
12,000,000-to-15,000,000 war-time peak
is apparently complete ; no further reduc-
tion of strength is contemplated. Per-
haps 3,500,000 to 4,000,000 men comprise
the land armies. The Navy, which in
fighting tonnage and ships is negligible,
still numbers some 350,000 men —many
of them naval or marine-land battalions,
but some of them in training to handle
new ships, including the considerable
numbers of new German Type 21 sub-
marines which the Russians captured or
are assembling from seized parts. The
Air Force is also extraordinarily large;
it numbers about 600,000 men, and has
a total of more than 30,000 planes of all
types. The air fleet includes 12,000 to
16.000 combat planes, including some
prototypes of very long-range bombers
like the B-295, but the Russians probably
cannot operate more than a quarter to
a third of this number at any one time.
“More than 1,500,000 of the Russiap
forces are outside Russian frontiers.
There has been, however, a reduction in
the size of Soviet occupation forces dur-
ing the past year —not so noticeable in
Germany and northern Europe, but pro-
nounced in the south-central area and to
a lesser extent in Manchuria. There has
been a heavy reduction in Austria and
Hungary—possibly owing to the fact that
Soviet forces could no longer live off
the Austrian economy, but nevertheless
Russian forces in Austria still outnumber
the combined Anglo-American-French
total there, and are backed up by thou-
sands of Soviet troops in the Balkans.
Russian forces in Rumania are being
somewhat reduced, but that country still
supports what might be called the Russian
strategic reserve in the Balkans —an army
about as large as the entire U.S. force
in Germany.
“The principal Russian interest in
Europe, however, is in Germany and
Poland. The Russians still maintain more
than 700,000 men in their sector of Ger-
many, backed up by at least 425,000
troops in Poland, and supported by, per-
haps, 25 per cent, of the Russian air
strength. Their policy in Germany—as
elsewhere —apparently is to maintain
occupying forces superior in numbers to
the combined occupying forces of the
Western Powers, backed up by immedi-
ately available reserves.
“In the east, the Russians have at least
750.000 troops concentrated east of Lake
Baikal, including a division or two in
Kamchatka, and detachments in the
Kuriles and the Komandorski Islands.
Strong forces guard Port Arthur and
Dairen, and there are still Russian de-
tachments along the Manchurian rail-
roads and a force three or four times
stronger than that of the U.S. in Korea.
“In addition to their own troops the
Russians are developing the armies of
their satellite Powers and helping to train,
lead and equip them. There are Russian
military missions and training detach-
ments in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia,
Poland, the Balkans an 4 Albania, and all
these countries are becoming more and
more the military satellites of Moscow.
There are 10,000 Russians in Azerbiijan,
most of them in civilian clothes or Azer-
baijan uniforms, helping to shape the
military forces of that puppet Iranian
province.
“Russian troop dispositions seem aimed
at enforcement of the Soviet political-
economic-military domination of eastern
Europe and north-eastern Asia. But
despite the strong military wall Russia
is building around her positions, there is
no evidence anywhere of any great con-
centrations for major offensive purposes.
British Dispositions
“British troop dispositions are almost
world-wide. The U.K. (exclusive of the
Dominions) is maintaining armed forces
of all three services which will.be re-
duced to about 1,200,000 by the end of
the year, and probably a majority of
these are outside the British Isles.
“Britain, like Russia, has her greatest
strength in Germany. She has two divi-
sions, recently merged into a composite
large division, near Trieste, facing, with
the U.S. Eighty-eighth Division, the
350,000- to 450,000-man Army of Yugo-
slavia. She has the equivalent of two re-
inforced divisions with supply troops in
Greece —-one near the sensitive point of
Salonika, another in and around Athens.
She is preparing to move out of Egypt,
but there are still large British forces
there, and two and a half combat divi-
sions, plus other major units in Palestine,
with other small detachments in Irak,
guarding British oil-wells and the en-
trance to the Persian Gulf.
“In the Far East, Britain is holding
grimly to Hongkong, and has a large
Empire occupation force in Japan, but
her 20,000 troops in the N.E.I. are being
withdrawn.
“British policy seems bent on keeping
the area west of the Trieste-Stettin line
in the Western sphere, and on guarding
the British lifeline through the Mediter-
ranean-Suez-Red Sea-Persian Gulf area.
The British policy is plainly defensive —
but strongly so —and is aimed toward
the maintenance, in so far as possible,
of the British status quo.
American Strength
“The strength of U.S. forces is more
than 2,200,000, of which more than
700,000 are outside the U.S. The largest
concentration is still in Germany, but
that is being redjiced rapidly.”
There are two divisions in Germany
and one near Trieste, four in Japan, two
in Korea, one in China, three (including
two divisions of Philippine Scouts) in the
Philippines, and five divisions in the U.S.
itself.
In addition to these divisional organisa-
tions, says Baldwin, “there are many com-
bat teams, battalions, detachments and
miscellaneous units scattered around the
world. In some instances, as in Alaska
and the Caribbean islands, these detach-
ments are fairly strong; in others they
consist of a few officers and men who
are caretaking details and are still liqui-
dating war-time investments in scores of
countries. There are still some 200 men
in Iceland. Iceland is a key stop on the
air-transport route to northern Europe,
and these men—air-base technicians,
weather men, communications personnel,
etc.—will train civilians to replace them.
Brazil has been virtually cleared of U.S.
armed personnel, though a few radio
technicians may still be there.
“The great bulk of American strength
in the Pacific is concentrated in the Philip-
pines, Hawaii and the Marianas —parti-
cularly on Guam. There are sizable
forces on Okinawa, but there are only
small detachments in most of the former
Japanese-mandated islands.
“The U.S. apparently intends to reduce
occupation forces in Germany and Japan
to policing minimums, which can have
little offensive capacity. In every instance,
U.S. ground forces in Europe and on
the Asiatiß mainland are stabilising de-
fensive forces which could not do much
more (except possibly at Trieste) than
delay and harass any attacker, but which
discourage attack as long as they are
there. In general, U.S. forces overseas
are the smallest of any of the Big Three,
but this is compensated for by strategic
bomber fleets and a large Navy.
French Forces
“France counts far less in the military
scales than the three Big Powers; she is
still suffering from war defeat and the
uneasy peace. She has two reinforced
divisions plus other troops in Germany,
a few thousand men in Austria, and an
unknown number —including some native
troops —in Indo-China. Her policy is
plainly defensive. She is trying, almost
desperately, to keep some balance be-
tween East and West and to retain if
possible the French Empire.”
Dragnet Digest.
(Condensed. from various acknowledged
sources .)
General de Gaulle has loyal, even fanatical,
adherents in many Government administrative
positions who expect him back. He remains
the only figure to whom a majority of the
French nation would be willing to turn in the
event of a national crisis. He has indicated
clearly that he is reserving himself for that.
He has refused to bind himself to any political
faction, and his every utterance shows that
France’s grandeur, prestige and future place in
Europe are the subjects closest to his heart.
His every utterance likewise confirms that he
identifies the salvation of France with his own
personality. Every indication goes to prove
that he will accept only the supreme direction
and that he will not return except on two
conditions; (1) As a candidate for President;
(2) As leader of the nation, called to cope
with a particular crisis, either financial or
political, such as the collapse of currency or
threat of civil or external war. But while he
has fanatical followers and even worshippers
who still regard him as savior of the nation,
he also has some bitter enemies. He is at
open cuts with the Communist party. They
accuse him of championing a Western bloc.
They accuse him of desiring a dictatorship. —
Lansing Warren in N.Y. “limes.”

“The U.S. is not distinguished by the con-
tinuity of its foreign policies. May it not be: —
and we who live in tlfe Pacific would infinitely
regret it —that its present interest in the area
may not prove to be merely a temporary
hobby? The most immediate danger in fha
Western Pacific is that of internal conflict and
disturbance. The whole area is astir, alive,
aflame with vivid and sometimes political and
social ferments, a resurgent nationalism, a re-
vulsion against any degree of external control,
a vibrant determination to change things, if
possible, for the better; at any rate, to change.
Add to all this the ominous cross-currents of
race, of color and of creed, and you have the
Western Pacific today, a melting pot which
is boiling furiously and which might conceiv-
ably .boil over.” — Sir Carl Berendsen, Maoriland
Minister to the U.S., reported in N.Y. “Times.”

More than 7,000,000 Germans and Japanese
are still held as p.-0.-w. It will be years before
most of them are released, and many never
will go home. They are being used as a
cheap-labor force to clean up the damage
their armies caused and to rebuild the cities,
roads, farms and factories they destroyed.
Imprisoned Germans are the biggest group.
More than 5,000,000 remain in Allied hands.
Russia is keeping most of these. The other
Allies estimate that Russia captured 4,000,000
Germans. Released prisoners report working 14
hours a day in mines and factories. In France
there are 700,000 Germans. If France has
her way they will be kept indefinitely. More
than 200,000 of them are working on farms,
55.000 in mines and 30,000 in forests.. Another
40.000 are building French homes and repair-
ing factories. War prisoners are building dams
and destroying minefields and other German
installations. There are 25,000 in French North
Africa and an equal number in the French
zone in Germany. The Germans are paid
about 10 cents a day, but the Government
charges the contractors who use them abopt
a dollar. Britain is using Germans to mine
coal and to harvest crops. The Air Ministry
employs some 20,000, and 85,000 work as day
laborers tearing down air-raid shelters and
cleaning up the debris left by German bomb-
ing. As in France, the Government is making
a profit on the work done. More than 100,000
German prisoners are held in the British zone
in Germany, in Italy and in the Middle East.
Other thousands are spread from Canada and
the West Indies to Gibraltar, Malta, Africa
and Australia. The U.S. has sent all but a
handful of an original 380,000 German prisoners
out of the country. About 500,000 were handed
over to the French, and 175,000, captured by
the British but held in the U.S., were returned
to Britain. The U.S. in Germany still holds
160.000 German soldiers and another 40,000
are in U.S. hands in Italy and Austria. About
50.000 are working in Belgium and another
50.000 in the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Czecho-
slovakia and the Balkans. Japanese prisoners
are being released faster. A million and a
half still are waiting to go home, but their
repatriation is being planned. In the meantime
they are working for all the Allied Powers.
Siberia is being developed by the Russians with
labor provided by Japanese captured in Man-
churia. Of the 1,000,000 Japanese under Rus-
sian control, more than half are in Siberia.
In South-east Asia 100,000 Japanese are clean-
ing out sewers and canals, repairing docks and
building airfields. About 20,000 are in the
N.E.I. and the rest in Malaya, Burma and
Siam. In China there are 400,000. Efforts
to hold prisoners have been made by most of
the Allies. Under international law, prisoners-
of-war are repatriated when the war is over.
But technically World War II will not end
until all peace treaties are signed. The victors
want to make the most use of the captive labor
in a time of general labor shortage.—“ World

MELBOURNE'S MOSES.
In the Estimates tabled at Canberra on'
the 14th day of the fifth month of the
financial year—a thing which, if conceiv-
able in Britain, would bring a vote of
censure on the Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, who is traditionally required to
be ready with his Budget during the first
month of the financial year so that the
taxpayers may prepare their private
budgets for the twelvemonth —£1,109,600
is down for expenditure at Mr. Calwell’s
discretion. There is £324,600 for the De-
partment of Information, that legalised
fraud on the people which came in with
the war and should have gone out with
it, and £785,000 for immigration. And
all listed as administrative expenditure.
At a time when the effects of the
highest income tax in the Empire are
being felt in every decent home—homes
of profiteers, blackmarketeers and other
harpies and parasites excluded from the
category —when pastoralists and wheat-
farmers have suffered cruel blows, and
when the production of dairy produce
and cane-sugar has fallen heavily no
Government in its senses would sanction
such items. Only a “Labor” Govern-
ment which has learned nothing from
the history of the country or which has
chosen to forget everything on record
about the devastating effects of droughts
on the Australian economy could intro-
duce them.
Graziers and wheatgrowers who re-
member the 1902 drought count the
current disaster worse, and not only be-
cause of the appalling destruction of stock
and crops. The drought of the nineteen-
forties has lasted longer than that of 1902,
and it struck the victims when war-time
shortages of labor and materials had left
their properties, in a bad state. This was
not the case in 1902, nor in that period
was income tax so savage as to have taken
from drought-stricken landmen almost
everything they had except their shirts.
In those years income tax was a baga-
telle. In these years, along with the high
cost of labor and everything, it has be-
come a serious obstacle to recovery ; and
only “Labor,” which never liked land-
men, anyway, fails to realise the grim
fact.
No one doubts that Mr. Calwell will
spend every penny of the £324,600 for
Information and try to get more. But it
will be difficult for even this prodigal
Minister to get rid of the £785,000 for
Immigration, since his effusively-adver-
tised plans for the introduction of British
immigrants, 35,000 in 1947 and 70,000
in 1948 and subsequent years, have gone
awry. They had the blessing of the
London “Times,” which, like Mr. Cal-
well, has abandoned its opposition to
the Left-wing crowd, though never so
hostile to it as was Mr. Calwell, who
when a private member was denounced
as a Red-baiter by the Communist Thorn*
ton.
The “Times” recently announced that
Mr. Calwell had everything ready for the
reception of the first-comers among the
35,000 immigrants of the 1947 vintage,
his arrangements being actually six
months in advance of arrivals. A dry
comment on this fustian came in a cable-
gram published on November 20: “The
Anglo-Australian migration scheme,
which was to be inaugurated on January
1, has been delayed.” Previously Mr.
Cain, Premier of Mr. Calwell’s State, had
been informed by the Agent-General,
Mr. Martin, that “the maximum accom-
modation that could be provided for
migrants in 1947 would be in the vicinity
of 9500 passages” ; and 140,000 appli-
cations for passages had been lodged.
“Labor” would not be “Labor” if it
didn’t blame the other fellow when
things go wrong, and the British ship-
owner is sure to get it in the neck in this
instance. With all the world bidding for
his services, he is showing no enthusiasm
for sending ships to Australia to become
the sport of wharf thieves (merely fined
by magistrates and never punished by the
Communist-controlled union), absentees,
go-slow artists and architects of capri-
cious stoppages and periodical strikes.
This was delicately hinted by the manag-
ing director of the Port Line when Mr-
Beasley attended the launching of an
12,000-tonner at Newcastle-on-Tyne: t-
It. is a melancholy thought that ships
fitted with modern contrivances for the
rapid handling of cargo are delayed, their
time wasted and expensive improvements
nullified by the obstructive tactics of
waterside workers. By some mistaken idea
the wharfie thinks he is hitting only at the
boss, presumably a portly type portrayed in
cartoons, whereas the boss nowadays is
all of us, and all of us, including the
wharfies, have to stand the racket.
Mr. Beasley agreed that it was “melan-
choly,” and declared that “nobody re-
grets the delays more than myself and
my colleagues.” He blamed the Com-
munists. The shipowner was too polite to
remind him that his Government
habitually crawls to the Communist
party and to the bosses and mobs of the
Waterside Workers’ Federation, in the
latter case even conniving at the main-
tenance of artificial labor shortages by
the closing of union books against new
members—this though Government com-
missions are in nominal control of the
ports and the Government itself, as the
instrument of Caucus, has supreme legis-
lative and administrative powers. More-
over, as the polite gentleman could have
pointed out, all the ports are represented
by “Labor”' Ministers and members,
among the Ministers Comrades Calwell,
Ward and Holloway and, until recently,
Comrades Makin and Beasley himself.
But the British Government is unlikely
to escape being cast in the part of scape-
goat. It will probably be accused of
going cold on emigration to Australia
because Mr. CalweU’s Government is
taking men from the tragically-under-
manned British building trades to raise
houses for civil servants. To this selfish
and heartless proceeding it is richly en-
titled to object. In the desperate plight
of its own people, millions of whom are
still houseless or living in bombed wrecks
of homes —this with winter coming on,
fuel short and food rations meagre and
monotonous, even if they have not to
be shared with millions of Germans to
keep them alive —the diversion of part
of the building-labor force to Canberra
is as wicked a thing as ever occurred in
the relations between parts of the British
Commonwealth.
And the Attlee Government, being
Labor as well as British and having a
horde of mischievous Leftists in its own
Caucus, would not be human if it did not
resent the lone-hand role assumed by Dr.
Evatt —and, in his absence, by one or
other of his imitation Talleyrands—at
peace-treaty and U.N.O. proceedings. In
the crying need for the British Common-
wealth to present a united front to a
world in which friends are few and
enemies bitter and as unscrupulous as un-
grateful, a need recognised and acted
upon by General Smuts, Mr. Fraser and
Mr. Mackenzie King, this has been a
chronic embarrassment, even when
attended by grotesque failures, such as
the rejection of nearly all the “Australian
amendments” to the five draft peace
treaties ; more than were presented by any
country in Europe, where Australia had
not even a platoon of ground troops. As
Dr. Evatt well knows, the British Govern-
ment cannot publicly object to this all-
out-of-step-but-Bert business, but objec-
tions have been made in other quarters.
That of the old Canadian Prime Minister
took the form of a rebuke as pointed as
he could deliver without mentioning
names;
For Canada to jump into Europe and
try to settle Europe’s problems with a
loud voice would be the worst possible
thing that could happen/
And the Sydney-born Air Chief Mar-
shal Longmore, home after many years,
spoke out at an Overseas League meet-
ing in Melbourne like the veteran fighter
he is:
While the old Lion is having his tail
twisted in so many places, there is much
sympathy from people in all parts of the
British Commonwealth but not a word
from any Australian Minister. Mr. Bevin
has done great work, but it is difficult for
a Foreign Minister to go to international
conferences uncertain as to whose support
he can rely on. An Australian Minister
has yet to say “We are with you; we like
your foreign policy; we like the way you
are handling affairs in Palestine, India and
Greece.” Yet demonstrations of Empire
unity would do more than anything to
prevent another war.
If the Air Chief Marshal knew Mr.
Calwell, and read files of lewish publica-
tions in which Mr, Calwell is periodically
extolled, he would not expect that worthy
to praise British policy in Palestine.
Whether or not Mr. Calwell is in earnest
about British immigration, other than the
purloining of men from the pathetically
insufficient buildingj-labor force in war-
wasted Britain to erect houses in a para-
dise for public servants which became a
funkhole for others when invasion was
feared, he has made himself the great
patron of Jewish immigration. Heedless
of the effect on British opinion, out-
raged by the incessant murders of Britons
in Palestine and by the threats to the
lives of the Royal family, he is securing
transport and entrance for Jews from
China, Europe and Palestine itself; and
they are coming not in single spies but
in battalions. In the compass of a few
weeks there will have arrived in Aus-
tralian ports a party of lews from
Palestine (number unstated), another from
Marseilles (180) and a third (200) from
the same port. Conceivably the Mar-
seilles groups came from the multitude
of lews illicitly collected in Central
Europe and illicitly passed through the
Russian and American zones over the
protests of the British Government and
General Morgan, who was sacked from
U.N.R.R.A. for exposing the nefarious
conspiracy and traffic.
Exercising his rights as a member,
Mr. Lang asked for the tabling of the
papers relative to such of the Strath-
more “migrants” as arrived from the
Middle East. From Mr. Cal well came
a refusal couched in impudent terms.
Too old a Parliamentary hand to be
thus fobbed off by a clumsy beginner,
the member for Reid thereupon gave
notice of motion for production of the
file, and the motion was seconded by
Mrs. Blackburn. Veteran and lady forth-
with became a target for coarse Calwell
invective, being accused of “trying to
repay the Liberal party for ensuring
their return,” of being stooges for “those
big interests which the Labor party de-
feated,” and of being “alien-baiters,
propagators of a vicious form of anti-
alienism.” This won’t go down even in a
Parliament under “Labor” domination.
The motion should come up for discus-
sion today, and if the Independents and
the Opposition are not ruled out by “veto
power,” so abhorrent to Dr. Evatt when
exercised in the northern hemisphere,
they may be expected to deal with this
uncouth and guilty Minister as he de-
serves.
Atomic Information.
Apparently in the belief that people do
not fear the atom bomb as much as they
should, an American Committee of
Atomic Scientists has launched an appeal
for a million-dollar fund for “atomic
education.” The idea appears to be that
if everybody everywhere realised the full
terribleness of the bomb that would be
enough to scare the world off war for
ever. If this line of thinking was really
sound a million-dollar fund would be
absurdly small. Unfortunately there are
fallacies in it; one great- fallacy in par-
ticular.
The stated aim of the committee is to
educate the public on “facts” about the
atom bomb “accepted by all scientists”:
“there is no military defence against
atom bombs, and none is to be ex-
pected” ; “other nations can discover
American secret processes by their own
experiments”; “preparedness against
atom warfare would be futile and would
ruin the structure of the social order” ;
“if war occurs, atom bombs will surely
destroy civilisation” ; “there is no solu-
tion to the problem except international
control of atom energy, and ultimately
the elimination of war.” Also, “atom
bombs can now be made at a price
which, in view of their destructiveness,
makes them cheaper than any other form
of explosive.”
Accepting all those statements as facts
—though some of them are palpable
assumptions —there seems to be little
enough in them not already generally
believed. Without subsidy from any
special fund, newspapers have made the
lot of them already thoroughly familiar
and hammered them into popular accept-
ance. Nobody anywhere has any doubt
whatever that in all-round frightfulness
and destruction another world war would
start where the last one left off. Even
in Australia, which escaped the blast of
two world wars, nobody believes that
there could be such luck again. Every-
where the atom bomb is thought of with
fear and horror. Since the first one was
dropped the thing has lacked nothing in
terror publicity. Its dreadful possibilities
are well known to everybody. Instead
of not being known and feared enough
it is like a dark shadow in which the
civilised world is groping for a light that
none can see.
The main trouble with the scientists
is that the most they can be expected to
do with their fund is merely pile on the
agony., They cannot let out the “atom-
bomb secrets,” which, in any case, few
would understand. They can only in-
tensify the prevailing general apprehen-
sion. What they are not at all likely to
do is to carry their educating on into the
political field, and bare the vital truth
that stands at the back of their bogey.
Everybody is familiar enough with the
face of the thing; but why is it really
menacing? Accepting that “there is no
solution to the problem except inter-
national control of atom energy,” why
is such control not established? Are the
scientists, in thus appearing to leave the
blame lying equally on all, really being
very “educational”? They recall a broad-
cast Dr. Evatt made on the atom bomb
in America:
If the peaceful development of atomic
energy is made possible, the old economic
contacts, the struggle for-living room, the
jealously guarded economic rights in power
resources—all contributing to the likelihood
of war—can be made things of the past.
Mankind, for the first time in history, will
have the possibility of a very high standard
of living, the possibility 'of entering into a
cultural heritage hitherto undreamed of.
These things will be made possible if we
can develop an international order from
which fear of war has been removed, an
international society in which law and not
force, welfare and not restriction, is re-
garded as paramount. These things will
be possible if we make- ourselves expert
in the science and aft of international co-
operation aimed at opening up a better life
to all peoples of the world.
Dr. Evatt may not have emphasised his
“ifs,” but he should have. Like the
scientists, he generalised ; leaving it, as
they have done, to be inferred that if
the “ifs” do not come off, if the inter-
national co-operation to control the
atomic future is not forthcoming, then
all hands will be equally at fault. Prob-
ably Dr. Evatt would not subscribe to
that generalisation today. He has prob-
ably learned the one .vital fact which the
scientists could point out if they were
really bent on a true educational mission
—that the atom problem is not a general
public one but a particular political one.
It breaks on a fundamental difference of
outlook, as between America-Britain on
the one side and Russia on the other.
There could be a beginning with estab-
lishing atomic control tomorrow if only
the political problem Could be solved.
Those who doubt where the blame lies
should look into and decide on what they
think of the American-British plan and
the Russian plan.
In the American-British plan an inter-
national agency would be set up with
complete and exclusive control of
atomic energy at its source and onwards.
The agency would have control over all
the means of producing atomic energy
everywhere. It would thus be able to
prevent its development for war pur-
poses ; and, while various nations would
be able to employ atomic energy as a
boon in its peaceful purposes, the agency
would have full rights of inspection and
supervision. Also under this plan the
atom bomb would be outlawed and all
such bombs already made would be de-
stroyed. U.N.O. would have power to
act against any nation which violated
the agreement, and there would be no
right of veto over such action.
This plan—which amounts to a vital
testing of the whole structure and real
worth of U.N.O. —is not at all accept-
able to Russia. The Russian plan would
allow all nations to control their own
uranium deposits and manufacturing
plants. The “atom secrets,” at present
held by America—it has been stated that
even Britain does not fully share in them
—would become the common property of
all. America’s “stockpile” of manufac-
tured bombs would, of course, be de-
stroyed, so that everyone could start off
level; and there would be “international
agreements” under which all nations
would undertake not to make or use
atom bombs.
Those, briefly, are the two plans; a
world of difference between them. In
effect, the Russian plan rests on professed
faith in signed agreements between
nations ; a grim joke coming from a
nation which in recent years has broken
more such agreements than any other
two nations put together, throwing the
late Axis in. The American-British plan
is based on only too-painful experience
of the broken word. The vital point of
difference is the American-British insist-
ence on the safeguards of regular inspec-
tion and supervision everywhere. That the
Russians will not have that at any price
might not necessarily indicate predeter-
mination to make the bombs and use
them at the right opportunity. All
through the war the Russians carried ob-
session for secrecy to absurd lengths.
They shut their fighting allies out as
rigidly as if they had been enemies, even
though complete co-operation would
have been of the highest mutual value.
It is the very nature of the Bear; a sus-
piciousness likely to be, if anything, in-
creased now that he is evidently suffer-
ing acute internal pains.
That is the best construction that can
be put on the Russian attitude, but it is
hardly a ground for generalising about
where the blame lies for the failure to
achieve atomic control. It makes no
difference whether the cause of The Rus-
sian attitude is mere childishness or the
most sinister designs ; it is that attitude
which today prevents solution of the
atomic problem, both in regard to re-
moving the war shadow of it from the
world and to taking advantage of those
undreamed-of peace-time possibilities
mentioned by Dr. Evatt. The scientists
need not worry about fear of the thing
not being deep and general enough, but
they could spend a million dollars very
usefully in spreading information on
where the blame for the deadlock really
lies.


PLAIN ENGLISH
McKell, G.-G.?
Even a people inured to shocks —and
there have been nasty ones lately—was
startled when it leaked out that a practis-
ing party politician, Mr. W. J. McKell,
was Mr. Chifley’s first choice for the suc-
cession to the Duke of Gloucester as
Governor-General.
Mr. McKell is in his sixth year
as “Labor” Premier. Early this year
it was announced that he proposed to
abandon public life and retire to his
Goulburn estate, where, among other
things, he breeds trotters. Uncertainty
as to his future has kept his fol-
lowers in a state of weird expectancy, or
something of the sort.
In the twenties during the first German
war, Mr. McKell did not attend it,
although it was noted that his favorite
recreations were football and boxing.
He became an M.L.A. in 1917, and in
that year also he opposed conscription,
the only method by which the A.1.F.,
after its cruel losses in France and
Flanders, could be adequately reinforced.
On the other hand he was at least a silent
supporter of the Government railway
strike in which Mr. Chifley was an active
participant.
In 1931, after two. previous tastes of
office, Mr. McKell was a member of the
Government whose Savings Bank, in con-
sequence of the Government’s crazy finan-
cial performances, went bung. Payments
to depositors were suspended from April
22, 1931, until December 15, 1931, when
the Commonwealth Savings Bank took
over the business, paying depositors £lO
or 10 per cent, from December 15, 1931,
and in full “early in 1932.” In the mean-
time many unfortunate people had sold
their balances to speculators at an appal-
ling discount; in some cases 50 per cent.
Mr. McKell was also a member of the
Government when, in the mild words of
the Commonwealth Year-Book, it “an-
nounced its default on interest payments
due in London, New York and Aus-
tralia” - (“January 28 to February 5,
1932”), and also when the Financial Agree-
ments (Commonwealth Liability) Act was
passed by the Commonwealth Parliament
and upheld by the High Court on a writ
for recovery of interest paid on behalf
of New South Wales. And, after his
Government resisted the operation of
this Commonwealth law, in the process
imperilling the whole Federal structure
and bringing the possibility of civil war,
he was one of the Ministers dismissed by
Governor Game on May 13, 1932.
This resistance to the law of the Com-
monwealth as upheld by the tribunal to
which its judicial power is assigned by the
Constitution was accompanied by a
plan for a piratical seizure of mortgagees’
money under forms of State law, with life-
assurance societies among the intended
victims. It was marked by the “removal”
of a State public servant on the score
of his obedience to the law of the Com-
monwealth. This faithful officer,, then
chief accountant in the Lands Depart-
ment, was “relieved of his duties” by the
Minister, Mr. Tully, who was to become
Mr. McKell’s own Minister of Lands
and to be sent by Mr. McKell to the Lon-
don office, leaving 18,000 to 20,000 would-
be soldier-settlers flat. Governor Game, in
pronouncing the dismissal of the Govern-
ment of which Mr. McKell was a mem-
ber, said it was “impossible” for him “to
put the Crown in the position of being a
party to illegal action” —“illegal action”
to which Mr. McKell had been a party.
Mr. McKell was Premier during the
whole period of the Japanese war.
During that period the most important
achievement of his Government was the
setting-up of a racing club with Treasury
backing, and with vast powers of land
resumption. The exercise of these
powers has already involved the “club” in
costly litigation, and fear of them drove
a projected Nuffield factory from a pur-
chased racecourse site.
Mr. McKell made repeated promises
of a liquor-reform measure. When the
thing made its appearance after upwards
of four years, during which American
and Australian servicemen and the gen-«
eral public were left without protection
against foul and daring varieties of black-
marketers, it was seen to be one which the
Trade could have drafted itself, since the
Act strengthens the hold of brewers on
tied houses and continues the privileges
of private landlords and licensees. And
when the fighting men returned from the
war they found few of the houses and
none of the farms promised in profusion
by the McKell Government. They found
instead that the McKell Government had
passed a measure granting to defeated or
retired Assemblymen and their widows
pensions far in excess of those provided
by the Commonwealth for maimed
servicemen and the widows of the dead.
Mr. McKell would have “qualified” for
£6 a week had he chosen to retire.
McKell Governor-General! If this out-
rage is consummated the high office will
be boycotted by at least half the people
of N. S. Wales and by most of the people
of the other five States, however the Mc-
Kell rdgime may be supported by
“Labor” politicians, boxing promoters,
pugilists, jockeys, racing publicans, night-
club proprietors, butchers, fishmongers
and other persons who accumulated riches
during the war.
Westrolia's Strike.
Last year the Westralian “Labor” Gov-
ernment received £2,644,100 as its share
of uniform-income-tax collections, plus
£950,000 as a special Commonwealth
grant, plus £912,500 (this under a so-
called Reimbursement Act), because it had
failed to balance its Budget. This year
it is to get £3,384,000 from the income-
tax fund and £1,245,000 as a special
grant; and it will need much more than
a million as “tax-reimbursement” or de-
ficit allowance when its accounts are
made up. The main cause of its unfinan-
cial condition is the chronic insolvency
of its railways, and the state of these
unfortunate enterprises will be worse than
ever as a result of the 16-days’ strike.
The strike was launched by the bosses
of a single union, the Locomotive
Enginedrivers, Firemen and Cleaners, be-
cause they didn’t like Garratt engines,
notwithstanding that Garratt engines are
approved of by no less an authority than
Mr. Ward as Commonwealth Minister
of Transport. The State “Labor” Gov-
ernment assumed an attitude of resist-
ance, the Premier, Mr. Wise, saying that,
“despite all the support the union will
get from the Communist press and those
allied, with Communism, the issue is
whether the Government shall govern.”
But in a situation where industry, as well
as Government transport, was paralysed
and whole communities were threatened
with starvation, it contented itself with
an appearance of sternness, leaving the
organisation of substitute transport ser-
vices to people with cars, trucks and
planes. They did a very good job, being
a resourceful lot.
And firmness was shown in other
quarters. An application for the deregis-
tration of the union was lodged in the
Arbitration Court, and deregistered it
was. -During the proceedings the presi-
dent of the union, one Davies, made
a cheeky interjection. “Sit down and
keep quiet,” said the president of the
Court, Mr. Dunphy. “If I hear anything
more from you I will have you arrested.”
On account of certain statements you
have made you are in danger of a criminal
prosecution. And any suggestion of a
linking up with another union in an
endeavor to force this issue amounts to
conspiracy under the criminal code, and
the penalty for all concerned is three
years’ hard labor.
President Dunphy proceeded to convict
the union and 22 of its delegates of
having instigated a strike, letting the im-
position of penalties wait upon the con-
duct of the strike promoters. Still con-
tumacious after the lapse of a few days,
the guilty union was fined £lOO and
each of the 22 delegates £lO. The Acting
Industrial Registrar, for his part, an-
nounced that “further processes” were
being prepared, every member of an
orgahisation engaged in a strike or lock-
out being liable under Section 137 of the
Act, which fie himself was required to
invoke. Within 24 hours the strike had
been declared off.
But on the “Labor” Government’s part
it was “a compromise settlement.” Gar-
ratt engines are not to be used unless
their use is sanctioned by a board of
five, two being strikers. Enginemen sus-
pended for refusing duty are reinstated
“without punishment or loss.” The Gov-
ernment is to acquiesce in union applica-
tions for “re-registration” and for “annul-
ment of all current legal proceedings.”
And it will be in accordance with
“Labor” practice if all the fines are
waived. In short, it is all too probable
that the fellows who, in contempt of the
industrial laws, brought great losses and
hardships on their fellow-citizens, and
probably death to sick old people de-
prived of transport, will go unpunished
and in a position to plan new outrages in
concert with Communists and with the
support of their poisonous press.
The self-imposed task of Diogenes was
nothing to looking for a “Labor” Gov-
ernment with guts.
The Scully Wool Centres.
Just before the Commonwealth election,
which nearly cost Mr. Scully his seat and
did cost him his portfolios of Commerce
and Agriculture, though a sinecure was
found for him, that gentleman declared
that “country wool-appraisement centres
are here to stay,” adding that “Labor
would “fight to the limit” all efforts to
have them abolished. There were then
two “centres,” at Dubbo and Moree
(N.S.W.). There have been no wool sales
at the first and one staged at the second,
just before polling day, was a fiasco.
To Mr. Pollard falls the embarrassment
of these white elephants—and others. For
one is proposed for Rockhampton,
another for Townsville- —each at a cost of
£BB,OOO, apart from the land —and for a
third at Portland (Vic.) tenders have been
called. Dalgety’s “Review” notes, some-
what mordantly, that the “whole outlay
is to be met from Government funds,
subject to amortisation on the principle
of payment by brokers for the use of the
building.” Since, as the “Review” makes
it abundantly clear, the brokers won’t
use them, the taxpayers will have to pay
for huge structures that will stand idle
until they fall down. But what’s that to
“Labor”?
Although sheepmen have lost in the
droughts at least a fourth of their
capital on the hoof, and though there has
been an almighty fall in production of
wheat, dairy-produce and cane-sugar,
“Labor” still clings to its notion that f the
taxpayer’s purse is bottomless.
Curbing the Bureaucrat.
Government by regulation, for years a
growing menace to the freedom of the
individual, has under Federal “Labor”
reached a point where it stultifies the
Parliamentary system, reduces debate
to a mere perfunctory observance
DESIGN FOR A CANBERRA
MONOLITH.
of the tradition of open discussion and
places the bureaucrat in control of
the lives and destinies of the people.
From South Africa, similarly inflicted,
though not so badly,- recently came a
glimmer of light. The Association of
Law Societies adopted a resolution that
It is essential that some system be devised
for the more efficient Parliamentary control
of government by regulation
After discussion, the Society suggested
that the remedy might be found in the
appointment of a Standing Committee
composed of members of both Houses
and all parties, which should continue in
existence during the life of a Parliament
and have power to sit whether Parliament
was in seksion or not. The first job of the
Committee these South African legal
men suggest would be
To revise all statutory regulations
now in force and recommend to Parlia-
ment the repeal or amendment thereof in
such manner as may seem to it appro-
priate or expedient.
Having cleared away the deadwood the
committee would then get down to its
real job of watchdog of the public in-
terest. The South African Law Society's
second proposal is
That all proposed statutory regulations
....shall be submitted to such committee
before promulgation, with power during
any recess to direct that promulgation
thereof shall be withheld pending the
approval of Parliament
It further suggests that regulations
framed while the House is sitting shall
not be gazetted until 14 days after the
report of the Committee has been tabled
in both Houses.
In considering the merits of regula-
tions the Committee is to see that
They do not trespass unduly on personal
rights and liberties or make the rights and
liberties of citizens unduly dependent on
administrative and not on judicial decisions.
It is too much to hope that the Aus-
tralian “Labor” Government would see
any merit in this plan. It regards
Parliament as merely a false front to be
used to give a semblance of respectability
to the decisions of Caucus, arrived at be-
hind closed doors.
The essence of such a Standing Com-
mittee would be that it should. be non-
party, and that it should approach its
job with the intention of trying to make
Parliament work. Any members ap-
pointed to it by “Labor” would already
be committed to Government by regula-
tion, and as its “Labor” chairman would
have a casting vote the report of its first
year’s proceedings would read something
like this:
Regulations considered Umpteen hun-
dred and um.
Regulations approved Umpteen hun-
dred and um.

Gentlemen—the Press!
There’s an old story of a French news-
paper editor who, after a visit to
America, returned to Paris impressed with
the need for pepping up his paper. He
commissioned a smart young reporter to
investigate a murder case and even draw
suspicion upon himself; and the young
man gave so convincing an act that he
was arrested. With some difficulty
he established his innocence and was
released, only to be seized by an
angry crowd —worked to frenzy by his
own reports —and hanged to the nearest
lamp-post. “Mon Dieu,” exclaimed the
editor, “they have lynched heem! How
truly Americain!”
It is doubtful whether any foreigner
would wish to copy some of the antics of
Sydney newspapers, which have been
surpassing themselves in the ignoble
business of “giving the public what it
wants.”
A jockey’s death at Randwick was the
occasion for yards of print and photo-
graphs ; and so was the funeral. Here a
morbid mob blocked traffic, poured into
the cemetery, trampled over graves and
left the consecrated place littered with
cigarette-butts, chewing-gum packets,
fruit peel and other rubbish. There was
about as much genuine grief in the mob
as there is in a bookmaker when he sees
a hot favorite beaten.
Then it came out that a missing
boy had been found dead under a
friend’s house and that the friend had
been arrested on a murder charge.
Reporters and cameramen flocked
to the stricken homes, and the child
under arrest was harried from pillar to
post, unavailingly trying to shield him-
self from the hungry cameras. And
the newspapers duly informed their
goggle-eyed patrons of everything from
the anguish of parents to the opinions of
detectives. Again, genuine sympathy was
absent, though it is barely possible that
some of the newspapermen went home,
gazed at their own children and were
ashamed.
f Next on the calendar of sensations was
a "jockey’s wedding. Big front-page stuff
this, with people (about four times as
many as were at the Cenotaph at dawn
on Remembrance Day) standing up in
pews and on pew-railings, clambering
anywhere about the church, what time
fountain-pens flew and cameras flashed
and rattled. And all the Sunday papers
carried a “full story” of the gifts, among
them furs and diamonds ; of “the Novem-
ber lilies, pink gladioli and rare orchids”
that adorned the church ; of “the cham-
pagne bottles on beds of cracked ice” at
“the reception” ; of the affectionate pair
“toasting one another in specially-en-
graved loving cups of silver”—other
people are so hit by income tax that they
can scarcely buy a new hat —and of “the
hand-made cream sycamore furniture, the
saxe-blue sheepskin carpets and rugs” in
“the lovely new cream cottage”—desper-
ate servicemen can’t buy a dog-kennel
for their families —winding up with a
last remark of the bride’s mother:
My husband and I intend to move from
Beverly Hills to Maroubra to be near our
daughter. The brick house we are living in
was built only this year but we intend to
sell it.
Beverly Hills is a good 10 miles from
Maroubra and both places have been
scoured again and again by home-seekers
who are not in the racing game. But
seemingly it’s no trouble for the mother-
in-law of a “fashionable” jockey to sell
one place and buy another.

McKell —from gee-gees to G.-G.?
Though it is never certain these days
how uncounted preferences will go, it
looks as if the Tasmanian electors have
made drastic changes in the composition
of their Assembly. Seemingly they did
not reject the “Labor” Government,
which had a 2-to-l (20-10) majority in the
last Parliament, but they fell heavily bn
two Ministers, Taylor (Forests) and Lane
(Mines), and reduced Gulley (Chief Secre-
tary) to a doubtful dependence on
the preferences of an Independent,
Townley, in Denison, Premier Cosgrove's
electorate. To the astonishment of all
but his immediate supporters, Townley
topped the poll, with more than twice as
many primaries as went to Cosgrove. In
the end there may be 16 Laborites, 13
Liberals and Townley.
Obviously this Townley (Reginald
Colin Townley, “Rex” to a multitude of
friends) is a man with strong views. Pith
of his election addresses;
All prosperity depends ultimately on pro-
duction the output of the individual
Australian worker.
The present system of taxation is stifling
production, is sheer economic madness.
Halve it and you double production!
Instead of paying producers to plough
their crops into the ground every available
ton of food should be grown and sent to
countries in need of it.
I stand for absolute priority for home-
building over every other type of build-
ing construction.
Railway expenditure should be tapered
off and provision made for increasing road
transport.
One ofv “Rex’s” “Labor” opponents,
Tyler, accused him, in common with
other Independents, of “representing
vested interests and being bitterly op-
posed to the ‘Labor’ party.” When
Labor saw the great primary vote
Townley got, it was furious with Tyler.
Commonwealth proceedings are being
taken against (1) T. A. Foley, who was
Queensland Minister of Health and Home
Affairs when, according to a magistrate’s
decision, contraband tobacco was found
on his private premises, and (2) Joseph
Goldberg, “footwear manufacturers’
representative, of York-street, Sydney” ;
in Goldberg’s case as a sequel to the
seizure of dutiable' goods (among them
“138 pairs of nylon stockings”) in trunks
labelled “Mrs. R. V. Keane.” Foley,
though still a member of Cabinet, is not
administering his department “for the
time being.” In each instance the sum-
mons is down for hearing tomorrow.
A few high-sounding extracts from
speeches by Baddeley, the N.S.W. Chief
Secretary, when he was rushing his
Fisheries and Oyster Farms Bill through
the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly in Oct„
1945: V
This commodity [fish] is coming in now
in a disgraceful condition... .We shall be
compelled to bring [fish] to the market be-
cause we have a duty to the people....
Officers of the department have assured
me that there has been malpractice and
that the public has been robbed We
want to lend a hand to the fishermen....
W© want to see the food sent to the
people We shall not permit the middle-
man to exploit the public This Govern-
ment will not stand for the racketeering
that is so prevalent nor for the thieving
and robbing that has been evident in the
metropolitan area
The bill became law. It “wiped” the
agents from the markets and made
Baddeley’s crowd sole controller of fish.
At the end of 13 months of “control” fish
is as scarce and dear as ever; and,
according to Bate, a Young Digger
M.L.A., the blackmarket has become
blacker and smellier. Baddeley’s reply to
Bate was, in effect, that there would al-
ways be a blackmarket and he’d need a
m
thousand inspectors to stop it; but that
hasn’t satisfied Bate nor will it satisfy the
plundered consumer.
One of the strikes with which Adelaide
has been plagued lately—one was on a
ship loading flour for India and Malaya,
where poor devils may die for lack of it
—concerned radio station SKA. Causes
complained of: poor wages and bad
working conditions, bugs and fleas being
mentioned. Just shows you what these
bloated capitalists will come at, the dirty
—what is that; Labor is part-owner?
Sorry!
Simultaneously the news came from
Canada that another man charged- with
being a member of the spy-ring directed
from the Soviet Embassy at Ottawa had
been convicted and sentenced to five
years’ imprisonment -and from South
Africa that eight members of the Com-
munist Central Committee had been re-
manded on charges of sedition, a sequel
to the Kaffir strikes. Meanwhile Aus-
tralian Communists remain at liberty to
sabotage industry, transport and foreign
policy, in these matters making the laws
to suit themselves.
While showing the utmost contempt
for “capitalistic” industrial laws. Com-
munists are not behindhand in appealing
to “capitalistic” libel laws when they
think they have been defamed. Thornton,
of the Red racket, brought an action
against Lang, withdrawing it on suffering
a rush of ice to the feet; and Michael
Healy, alias McCracken, sued the Bris-
bane “Courier-Mail” for £5OOO damages.
Lang got his costs from Thornton. It
seems improbable that the “Courier-
Mail” people will get theirs from Mc-
Cracken, alias Healy; still, somebody
may come to the rescue.
In a little over a month a Calwell
chicken will be flying home to roost at
Canberra, Calwell having undertaken to
start in January with bringing 35,000
immigrants from Britain in 1947. Two or
three months ago he was quite cocky
about it, and the London “Times” con-
gratulated him on having arranged for
the shipping and Australian reception of
the first party six months in advance.
Which shows once more how credulous
even old newspapers become when they
swing to the Left. Would-be passengers
well up in the queue, which stretches from
Charing Cross to John o’ Groats, would
be well advised to disguise themselves as
refugee Jews or as boxers consigned to
Wren’s Stadium.
If the Sydney Botanical Gardens will
take it, King George V is to be com-
memorated by “a 30ft. monolith of red”
(not Red) “granite, with a cement core
and a concrete foundation, and with an
engraved design representing aboriginal
life.” Apparently the great news was
communicated at once to Government
House, Canberra, from which there came
a hasty announcement that the Duke
would be leaving for London by air on
January 16. So he may never see this
unique work of art or craft or whatever
it may be called. H.R.H. may be ac-
counted fortunate.
Nowadays, except when the salary-
cheques come in, the Westralian Labor '
Government’s career is all jolts. During
the first week of the railway strike a bill
legalising shop betting was heaved out of
the Assembly by the votes of the Opposi-
tion and two Labor members. One was
W. D. Johnson. The sole remaining
Laborite of the original (1901) vintage,
Johnson can’t agree with the present
generation of “Labor” politicians that the
way to make the people “enlightened and
self-reliant” (in the terms of the old
objective) is to give them heaps of racing
clubs, mid-week racing, night-trotting, off-
the-course betting and lotteries.
“Labor” has peculiar ideas about in-
terest. Its Queensland central executive,
trying to establish a radio station,
wouldn’t issue shares in the show because
it feared some other breeds of “Labor”
might get hold of them, so it made an
appeal to “affiliated” unions for £25,000
in loans. Interest offered is 3i p.c. This
when Canberra has decided to reduce the
rate on long-term loans from 31 p.c. to
31 p.c.
One certain result of recent changes
in the U.S.A. is that Henry Wallace
will never be President. It was thought
in the Leftist circles in which he moved
that he would be an asset to the Demo-
cratic party in the elections of Congress-
men and State Governors, but he proved
one of its worst liabilities. Descending to
the cheapest and nastiest Communist
jargon, he attacked Churchill as “the
world’s great Red-baiter.” It looks as, if
a great many Americans think much
more of Churchill than they do of
Wallace.
Sixteen months ago a lot of Leftist
journalists and Jews were carried into the
House of Commons on the Labor wave,
along with a few carpet-bag politicians
like R. W. G. Mackay, formerly of Syd-
ney. Most of these people figured among
the 57 so-called “rebels” who, in Bevin’s
absence, attacked their Government’s
policy on the score of its being too
friendly to America and not sufficiently
servile to Russia. When Attlee showed
a firm front, the “rebels” went pale at the
gills, and not one of them voted when
their “resolution” was put to the House.
Leftist journalists and their friends have
plenty of gas but no guts.
Queensland “Labor” defeated Opposi-
tion attempts to remove from its Co-
operative Societies Bill the clause which
gives co-ops. power to acquire the land,
premises and plant of private companies
or owners, and also rejected an amend-
ment designed to give a right of appeal
to the Supreme Court. These powers are
even greater than those vested in Sydney
“Labor’s” Turf Club. When challenged,
as they will be, they may be declared
illegal, as was the refusal of “Smoke
Bomb” Barnes’s pay.
Harold Clapp bobbed up in Darwin
a week or so ago and informed the
astonished denizens that a standard-gauge
line to connect their town with the S.A.
system would be built at an estimated
cost of £20,000,000. He could “envisage
the day when fast, fully air-conditioned
expresses will be running from Darwin
to Adelaide on regular schedules” —sub-
ject, of course, to the whims of the
N.S.W. coalminers. Walsh, the Queens-
land Transport Minister, Snorted that it
was “a change of front,” and that
Queensland was against anything that
didn’t put standard-gauge lines to
Queensland ports first.
An announcement by Health Minister
Barry that he favored a State lottery in
Victoria was followed by anguished de-
nials from other “Labor” Ministers, who
said they wouldn’t have anything to do
with the darned thing. In any case, their
party hasn’t a majority in either House.
Hollway points out that the Government
is. being kept in office by the votes of
two Independents, both religious.
Owners of important buildings in Mel-
bourne had been soothed into the illu-
sion that the invasion of the city by
armies from Molonglo, which began in
the first years of the war, was finished
and that the retreat had been sounded.
They got a shock when they learned that
the Manchester Unity Oddfellows’ build-
ing, opposite the National Gallery, was
being “taken over” for Trans-Australia
Airlines, the Department of Munitions
and Aircraft Production. Before the
election negotiations for a .lease of the
11-storey building were in progress and
an undertaking was given that no action
would be taken till after the election.
Then there arrived a peremptory notice of
compulsory acquisition. The brand-new
building stands next to a hotel advertised
as “opposite Phar Lap’s stable” —the
Museum.
When representatives of 44 nations
agreed at Bretton Woods, New Hamp-
shire, to set up an international fund
and a world bank. Communists were en-
thusiastic, hoping that the thing would
embarrass the British Government. Then
Moscow turned hostile, and the Corns, of
course, changed their tune. After a long
delay Chifley persuaded his Cabinet,
though far from unanimously, to support
the agreement, but three sets of A.L.P.
delegates went to their Federal confer-
ence under instructions to oppose it.
With Ward in opposition also “Aus-
tralia’s” attitude was still in doubt at the
beginning of the week. The nation has
so many masters that it never knows
where it stands until its masters come to
a decision.
The versatile record of Bulgaria’s new
Premier, Georges Dmitrov: 1923, fled
from Bulgaria, a whisker ahead of the
police; 1930, head of the “German”
Communist party; 1933, confounded
Goring with his “oratory” and escaped
execution for alleged complicity in the
Reichstag firebug plot; 1935, general
secretary of the Comintern and chief
instructor to the “Australian” Com-
munist party ; 1939, chief campaigner for
peace with Hitler, on the ground that
there was “nothing left to fight for” ;
1940, Russian Governor-General of
Soviet-occupied Poland ; 1942, Com-
missar in the Soviet Union Foreign Office.
And now the adaptable statesman is
leading a “free, democratic” Bulgaria.
General Johnson, one of the American
officers sent to Australia to see to the
land transport of troops and supplies (he
is vice-president of the Eire Railroad), has
been lecturing on his experiences. He
said the party found the “railway struc-
ture” so “inadequate” that a vast amount
of “improvising” had to be done. For
one thing it “successfully experimented
with converting jeeps for use on the
northern branch of the Queensland rail-
ways,” and had to serve “our warehouses,
built under mutual-aid and filled with
Australian foodstuffs and other,supplies,”
with “newly-constructed tracks and im-
provements in handling facilities to ex-
pedite traffic at break-of-gauge points
(there were five different gauges, and the
main mileage was divided between
three),” General Johnson approved of the
standardisation project in principle, but
referred to the necessity for “standard
equipment and operating practice, per-
haps on the Association of American
railroads pattern.” Finally he said,
“There is little object in co-ordinating
strength with weakness, and the proposal
becomes of real value only if all the com-
ponents are reasonably strong.”
Attlee remarked in a speech that the
British Commonwealth of Nations was
setting an example to the world of show-
ing how unity could exist without uni-
formity. The P.M. knows his classics and
obviously had in mind John Buchan’s
reference to Augustus and his Roman
Empire. “What he sought was unity of
sentiment, not an unfeatured uniformity ;
and he attained it,” Still, neither Attlee
nor Augustus ever argued that unity could
best be expressed by being always out
of step. That belief seems peculiar to
Our Foreign Policy.
It is obvious enough that a great
many decent unionists hate the strikes
in which they take part and which inflict
grievous injuries on their own families
and communities and blacken Australia's
name. But they may well protest that
they have to strike when called upon,
being unable to stapd up against threats
of imminent assault (“put up your hand,
Bill, or we’ll kick your guts in!”) and
of being branded and treated as “scabs,”
hounded out of their jobs and homes, and
being incapable in any case of arguing
with mob-orators who have basher gangs
to drive home their points. Give decent
unionists legal protection at every point
of their membership, place their leaders
under every legitimate form of legal
restraint, and the strike promoter’s occu-
pation will be gone.

“Plop”: I’m not going to be roped in
this time by any of the “Find the Ball”
competitions that bespatter the daily
papers. I had a crack at one years ago and
drew lines from each of the player’s eyes,
intending to pick the spot where they
crossed. But as the batsman appeared
to be studying the scoreboard to see
whether a quick run would be worth
while, and the bowler was contemplating
his bootlaces, and the remaining players
were looking askance in all directions, I
discarded that method, judged roughly
where the ball might be, and drew a cross
with my eyes shut. The mark so made
was fair in the middle of the batsman’s
forehead, so I tore up my entry. Next
week came the answer; with the ball
shown bouncing off the batsman’s skull.
It was the time Larwood hit Bert Oldfield
in Adelaide.

“Puyyaka”; A curious and still-
unsolved problem is that of the apparent
causal connection between the occurrence
of German measles in expectant mothers
and deaf-mutism amongst the resulting
children. A Brisbane specialist has re-
cently collected records of nearly 100
such cases amongst Queensland children
of from three to eight years whose
mothers were infected while pregnant
during the two latest epidemics, and simi-
lar observations have been made in other
States. As a general rule, the earlier the
disease occurred in pregnancy the worse
appeared to be the effect on the child.
In itself German measles is a mild
disease, mostly occurring amongst chil-
dren. The causal organism has not yet
been grown artificially, and no preventive
vaccine has therefore been possible. It
is highly communicable, and occurs in
periodic epidemics. No reason for the
dire heritage which it inflicts upon un-
born babies has been evolved by
pathologists. The only present safeguard
against it is for expectant mothers, par-
ticularly in the early months, to avoid
contact with known cases and their
surroundings.

“Oxmead”: The British Chancellor of
the Exchequer who, “running his eye
over the data from which he was to de-
liver a Budget speech, inquired testily
‘What are those damned dots?’ —the
same being decimal points” (B. 13/11 /’46),
was, of course, Lord Randolph Churchill
(Winston’s father), and not Gladstone.
The date, as nearly as I can recall it, was
1886, and the story had so wide a cur-
rency for years afterwards that it is
amazing to find the remark, even after
60 years, attributed to anyone else. Least
of all to Gladstone, who was a scholar of
distinction as well as a statesman, and
who certainly wouldn’t have said
“damned” in any circumstances.

“Passun”: We were toiling for Nippon
on a road job, our unbearable burden
being Diamond Jim, one of the worst
guards ever seen at Haisho. At the
“meshi” break Jim fell to sleeping, and
our bravest hearts took to the sweet-
potato patch beside the road. Haversacks
showed excellent results before the Jap
awakened. Into the picture came the
pimp, an ancient Chinese villager. The
booty was emptied into the drain and
Jim got to work. The ancient, rather
unhappy about the bashing, tried to
interfere; Jim’s dog-walloper landed
on his kidneys, and the much-wronged
Hainan citizen left the scene. At knock-
off time we went down the road to col-
lect our gear. The haversacks were bulg-
ing and strangely heavy—every haver-
sack was chock-a-block with sweet-bucks.
As we marched off, happily anticipating
a feed, we caught a glimpse of the ancient
Chinese grinning at us from behind a
thicket.
“Frank Mauri”: I knew only one Nip
with a sense of humor; “Wirewhiskers,”
adjutant at Tamarkan Camp, Siam.
Asked for information about p.-0.-w.
mail he shook his head evasively and
replied, “I think Mr. Churchill send air-
mail today.” Then our ears, too, caught
the distant drone of the Liberators.
“Penelope’s Mate”: For our arrival at
Hainan Island after a ten-day trip from
Ambon on the Taiko Mara, the colonel
had ordered us to dress as near to regi-
mentally as possible. We made a good
"I rather fancied something not quite so FRESH!”
showing lined up on the tumbledown
wharf. Then six of us were detailed to
clear officers’ kit from the hold, and for
an hour we labored midst trunks and
suitcases, coaldust and scrap jute, in a
temperature peculiar to Jap ships in the
tropics. Eventually the luggage found its
place in waiting trucks and was whisked
away while we fell in with the few
remaining Australians still waiting to be
marched off. They were under the sur-
veillance of a white-turbaned, bearded
Sikh captain, displaying on his immacul-
ate shirt the little red-dot insignia, of the
Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere
and the badges of His Majesty’s Indian
Army, Hong Kong Artillery Regiment.
Came the clipped order, “Attention! ”
Then he spotted us: six coal-grimed,
sweat-soaked, exhausted hobos. “Damned
niggers,” he said loftily. “Right turn.
Quick march.” And thus chastised by
the new order in Asia we mooched away
to hell for three years.

“Jobber”; Mention was recently made
of the oldest Bulletin rhymester still
turning, out verse. What about the bloke
who deals in prose? In a Bulletin of
the late ’nineties Alf Vincent had a full
page drawing of a swagman asking a
station manager for a job. On the veran-
dah, outside the boss’s office, a saddle
had been put down with the flaps
stretched flat out. I had the temerity to
point out to the Bulletin that any man
who put a saddle down like that would
not last long on any station. The par.
was printed—and I had just turned
fifteen! I carried that par. about in my
pocket until it went back to the pulp from
which it was made. I have since con-
tributed pars from the bush, the sands of
Egypt, dug-outs on Gallipoli, Flanders
fields, the Old Country and back home.
That covers half a century; so now, old-
timers, let’s hear from you!

“Niloc”: When the bottom of my socks
started to wear thin and pick up gravel
I decided on new shoes. The sales-
rilan produced a measuring device
for getting the dimensions of my plates
of meat to the nearest superficial yard.
Having jotted down the necessary notes
and worked them out in algebra, he dis-
appeared, returning with a pair of shoes.
I placed these on very gently lest my
great toes penetrate the paper-thin bows,
and was invited to inspect them through
an X-ray device. There were my feet,
nestling within the shoes in a background
of green light. None of the bones
appeared to be crossed, and the sales-
man assured me that they were a perfect
fit. I departed feeling confident that at
last here were the beginnings of the
Golden Age. I’ve worn them a week. If
know anyone with size-eleven feet
who would like to break in an excep-
tionally uncomfortable pair of shoes,
please contact me as soon as possible.

“Firebug”: After the Security Loan
fireworks display on Sydney Harbor an
ageing Digger trammed home with me,
growling that “They were just bloody
Very-lights.” He brought to mind a night
at Jacquinot Bay, New Britain. The boys
had been out of it for a long while, and
to keep up an interest in matters war-
like the R.S.M. turned on an exhibition of
some new type of mortar parachute-flares.
Perhaps the local moisture had affected
the missiles, but 17 bombs in succession
left the barrel, climbed gracefully with a
tiny trail of sparks, and fell with a plop
into the jungle. The Sarmajor started to
glow a bit and the mob soon caught on,
giving a heartfelt, “Aw, gee!” at every
plop. Then No. 18 did the honors and
burst with a brilliant light. Hats went
up in the air and were kept aloft by the
mighty roar of “Ain’t it lovely!” Dark-
ness closed in again, followed by the
C.O.’s crisp tones “Company commanders
will now escort the men back to their
own lines.”

“R.H.P.”; Mishandling of tram tickets
is not always done through absent-
mindedness (B. 30/10/’46). In staid and
steady Hobart I saw a whole cricket
team pop their tickets into their mouths
and chew vigorously, having seen an
inspector board the tram. When eleven
blobs of unwholesome-looking pulp,
about the size of a pea, were shoved
under his nose, he cursed those cricketers,
individually and collectively, and left.

“Dick Tafone”: Evil days have be-
fallen Brisbane’s once-famous million-
pound City Hall, now marked down to
half price and regretfully described by
Ludmayor Chandler as a disgrace to the
city. It certainly is. Dirt and dilapid-
ation, broken walls and cracked ceilings,
gloom, grime and makeshift staff ac-
commodation replace its former glories
and there seems to be no present hope
of restoring them. Reasonable renovation
would require the work of thirty men for
six months and enough paint to cover
50 or more of the thousands of private
houses which need it even more badly
than does the civic once-white elephant.
Permission would have to be obtained
from the Works and Housing authorities,
and, with the existing shortages in living
accommodation, even his Ludship seems
disposed to admit that it would be unjust
to grant it.

“Salamanca”: Crossing the Tasman
just before the war I struck an interesting
team at the chief engineer’s table. An
Adelaide lawyer, a fight promoter
and a N.Z. racehorse owner made
mq.st of the running, but it was the chief
who more often than not supplied the
extras. At one meal mention of
Houdini’s name led the Adelaide man
into a rather windy eulogy. “He’d get
out of anything, I tell you,” was
aggressively repeated several times. A
bored expression crept over the chief’s
face. “Well,” he said, “Houdini was once
in quarantine with me in Perth, and
he couldn’t get out of that!”
* * * *
“Hamer”; A feature of Sydney life
which seems to have gone out with a past
that is dead is the private employment
office. There were half a dozen of them,
well known to work-seekers, who filled
their waiting-rooms and spilled into the
street. These exchanges displayed black-
boards on which were chalked the jobs
available; these were struck out as filled
and new jobs were added. A con-
stantly-recurring line was “Married
couple, wife cook, man useful, £1 per
week and keep” ; many people who be-
came prosperous moved off to that start.
Yet romance sometimes hovered about
the offices. One man having hung
around for a job that did not come
suggested to a girl who was also a regular
that they get married and put in for one
of the “m.c.” jobs that seemed plentiful.
They were married that afternoon and
caught the night train on the way to a
sheep-run job. The man subsequently
became manager of the station and then
its owner; later his sway extended over
many stations.

“Wigwag”: “Bo” is not the only worm
to turn (B. 6/11/ ’46). In Adelaide a
clergyman was rather abruptly refused a
packet of cigarettes. “I told you not five
minutes ago that there’s not a cigarette in
the shop,” said the young tobacco baron.
The clergyman fumbled in his pocket and
produced a packet of 20. “Then, perhaps
I can let you have a packet of these at
the ordinary price,” he offered mildly,
“The shop over the road sold me two
packets like this a few minutes ago.”
* * * *
“Uco”: The silly season never ends as
far as Sydney newspapers are concerned,
but every now and then an extra whiff of
ozone from the Pacific or of pollen from
the mountains—or perhaps just an, inborn
preference for banality—makes them
plumb new depths in their desire to give
their public what they think it wants.
A short time back they undertook a quest
in search of the barman or -maid who
could carry simultaneously the greatest
number of mugs of beer. Now the matter
of vital interest to their readers is pre-
sumed to be the discovery of the milk-
bar attendant who can “throw” a glass
of milk the furthest without spilling a
drop. But the depth of stupidity, even on
a week-end when three Sunday papers
splashed a jockey’s wedding over their
front pages, was reached by the rag that
gave space and three photographs to a
mother’s darling of 2\ years who had
been taught by her misguided parent to
make-up with rouge, powder and lipstick.
Any day now one of the rival sheets will
counter with a young man of 18 months
who mixes his own cocktails.

“Galenus”: Brisbane’s municipal health
service is receiving congratulations on the
fact that there have been no patients in
the diphtheria ward at the Children’s
Hospital for the first time since its open-
ing in 1910. Nor are there any adult
Sufferers from the disease at the Wattle-
brae Infectious Diseases Hospital. Credit
goes to the immunisation campaign which
has been conducted by the Council for
20 years. There is no recorded case in
Queensland of an immunised child dying
or diphtheria, although in pre-immunisa-
tion days more children of one year and
over died of it than from any other
disease. Diphtheria is still the most fatal
of all diseases amongst non-immunised
children. The greatest risk of infection
and of death is amongst children of pre-
school age, and the best age for initial
immunisation is between nine and 12
months. No Australian parent should
neglect any opportunity of safeguarding
his family.

“Colbun”: A Manchester professor
has recently propounded a theory that
our Stone-Age European ancestors really
started the habit of preferring blondes.
According to him, they were urged by a
desire to save their descendants from
the then - prevailing swarthiness. The
theory is supported by the universal
tradition of fair skin, blue eyes, and
golden hair as characteristic of good
fairies and heroines of legends which date
back beyond recorded history. But the
prehistoric cult of the blonde is by no
means limited to European races. In
Japanese legend and painting the Sun
Goddess, Amaterasu, ancestress of the
Imperial dynasty, is a vivid blonde, and
this despite the fact that the Japs’ fore-
runners in Nippon, the Ainus, were a
white race and still are, beneath their
dirt. The Aztecs also preferred blonde
goddesses. And it is my considered be-
lief that beer tastes better from the hands
of a blonde barmaid, whether dispensed
in pewter or in glass.
THE RUSS.
They’re thoroughly likeable fellows —or so
They’d have us regard them—Joe Stalin and Co.
To be friendly with them is the easiest task
Provided they’re given whatever they ask,
And no one endeavors their view to contest
That in all things concerning themselves and
the rest
Of the world the redoubtable Kremlin knows
best
What’s the proper solution. A warning to us
On the folly of getting too tough with the Russ.
Though they can call others as oft as they like
Names certainly apt to occasion the spike.
And vilify Winston, who once, as we know,
Was a shield and a buckler for Georgian Joe,
Yet it rouses them out of their Muscovite
phlegm
And in vehement terms they berate and
condemn
Anybody presuming to criticise them.
So you mustn’t forget he’s a sensitive cuss
Whose feelings are easily ruffled, the Russ.
He can shake the big stick at all neighbors
within
His purview, the Pole and the Czech and the
Finn,
He can bully the Bulgars, Rumanians too,
Hungarians, Austrians —Heaven knows who.
He can put pressure on them with vigor and
vim,
But he laughs at the notion, sardonic and grim,
Of anyone trying such methods on him.
He’s a law to himself, or he visions it thus,
And they’re taking a risk who get tough with
the Russ.
He’s as trusty a partner as ever you’ll know
If you only concede that he’s bossing the show.
No trouble he’ll make and no temper display
If you merely allow him to have his own way,
A truism no one can scout as absurd.
And already, you’ll notice, shrill voices are
heard
Intently insisting our leaders have erred,
And some politicians are making a fuss
For fear that we’re getting too tough with the
Russ.

“Ike Hollar”: A long time ago a par.
of mine questioned how many people
could recall the Commonwealth Ode for
which George Essex Evans collected a
hundred guineas during the celebrations
of the birth of the Commonwealth. I’ve
found a man who can ; to prove it he
recited the opening lines thus:
Avake! Avake! Der vinks of tawn
Vos beadin’ on der gades off tay....
My friend has been ten years in this
country. He told me that before he
left Austria he read all he could
about Australia and struck the Evans
verse “someveres.” He memorised
it partly as an exercise in English and
partly because he thought Australians
would be pleased at his knowledge of a
bit of Australian patriotic verse, “E>ey
looked as if dey wondered vot it was all
aboud ven I showed off mit it,” he adds
with a grin.

“Clooter”: On what grounds does a
fellow establish himself as a cricket
writer? Just before rain washed out the
England v. N.S.W. match my afternoon
paper informed me that the English cap-
tain, winning the toss, had “surprisingly”
sent N.S.W. in to bat. Next morning the
paper that comes with the milk appeared
to consider the Englishman’s decision
astonishing. Well, I’m no cricket expert,
but if I were a captain and won the toss
on a dull morning, with light rain already
fallen and more obviously about to fall
and four days of cricket ahead, I wouldn’t
expect to astonish anybody who knew the
game by sending the opposition to bat.
“Bo”; So early in the big cricket sea-
son those proved stayers “brilliant,”
“superb” and “dashing” have left every-
thing else at the post in the Sporting
Scribes’ Adjectival Stakes. I don’t mind
“brilliant” being applied when a fields-
man tops off a series of excellent saves
“Nothing ever happens in this dump.”
with a few wonderful catches ; but “dash-
ing” has lately been applied even to bats-
man who have taken an average of a
minute and a half for each run scored —
shades of Macartney, Trumper and
Woolley! I suspect that many of our
sporting writers, “brilliant” analysts all,
have taken as their model the local-rag
scribe who thus described the effort of
the town’s champion bat: “Demonstrat-
ing the magnificent form he is in, Me-
Googan, scoring freely with a bewilder-
ing series of powerful hooks, drives,
cuts and pulls to every point of the com-
pass, ran to 9 before being bowled with
a full toss.”

“Niloc”: With Army discharge pro-
gramme almost completed and intake of
volunteers almost a thing of theory only,
Diggers seen now in our cities bear all
the earmarks of a vanishing race. Those
still awaiting discharge are getting a
variety of strange jobs. Some are finish-
ing off their fighting days tending blos-
soms at Victoria Barracks, and the rem-
nants of the n.c.os. are having their last
fling at instructing school cadets on their
annual camp. At such a camp an ex-
Ninth Division sergeant, returning late
from the mess, was confronted by a four-
foot sentry armed to the teeth. The
sarge announced himself as “friend’
and asked the wee warrior what his task
was. “I’m guarding Wallgrove camp,”
was the stunning retort. The sarge de-
parted with a grin, wondering how he
himself would go protecting a five-mile
front.

“Jasby”: Among the reported
“weapons” of American scientists is a
globe which is to be projected into space
till it reaches a point where the earth’s
gravitation, instead of dragging it back,
will merely cause it to revolve round our
planet indefinitely, an artificial satellite.
The purpose of it isn’t too clear, but
someone has obviously been reading
H. G. Wells. Having got his explorers in
First Men in the Moon successfully back
to earth faced with the problem
of doing away with their spaceship in
order to tidy up the story. The inventor
and his formula had been left behind on
the moon, so there was no question of
other “globes” being made ; the only diffi-
culty was to get rid of the prototype. I’ve
always admired the simple means H.G.W.
employed to do this. The space-wanderers
■had made their earthfall on Brighton
beach and had rushed hungrily into a
pub for some sustenance. Along came
Master Tommy Jones, who had strayed
from his nurse’s care. He found the
spaceship, climbed inside and pressed a
few buttons. He, or his corpse, is still
exploring the outer regions of space.

“P.L.”: Repatriated to Australia by
aircraft-carrier we had been systemati-
cally rooked at every port of call. At
the Canal we bought phoney handbags
that came unstitched in the slightest
breeze ; at Aden we invested in cigarette-
lighters constructed by blind - drunk
rock hewers and at Colombo we had the
same run of luck with mahogany book-
ends and knuckle-dusters —the only items
for sale. We were all a bit light in the
pocket, fed-up and thirsty—the only beer
about was Elephant brand, guaranteed
to choke a Hindu fanatic —when Larry
shouted, “Strike me pink, I’m having
some of that!” and dashed off down the
street towards a building over which in
large lettering was the word Free. We
waited. In a minute or two he rejoined
us, disillusioned. “It’s no use, chaps,” he
said, “you can’t read it all from here.
It’s Free China Cafe.”

“Tackline S.”: Folk who hate red-tape
should avoid the merchant navy. The
man signing off puts his signature to
accounts of wages to show he’s
satisfied with the amount; the port-
age bill in triplicate for the office
staff’s benefit; two copies of ship s
articles to admit that he is leaving his
job ; release-book to relieve his employer
of liabilities of all kinds; certificate of
discharge to please the Superintendent
of Mercantile Marine. In no other job
is resignation so complicated. No
wonder the sailor always goes to the
nearest pub as soon as it s all over,

“Curtain Raiser”: During Melbourne s
transport strike, when ones office neigh-
bor bored one daily with tales of his mar-
vellous achievements in walking to the
city instead of riding, it needed a visit
to Wirth’s Circus to renew one’s respect
for the potentialities of the human body.
If the young lady who turns 31 somer-
saults without stopping had had a differ-
ent upbringing, she would have thought
that to walk four miles to her job would
have finished her for the day, and if
anyone told her of the automatic walkers
of Tibet she would suspect a leg-pull.
When the Lamas want to send a message
to a distant part of the country they resort
to one of these peripatetic yogis. Spells
“Come, Mr. Bryant—nine extractions are mere CHILD’S play to us!” .
and incantations put him in a trance and
he starts off. He goes with a strange lop-
ing stride which covers two strides of an
ordinary man and it never changes,
though the route lies over some of the
roughest country in the most perpendi-
cular State in the world. People recog-
nise him by his walk and step to one side
when they see him approaching, and he
is never hailed for fear the spell will be
broken. He walks day and night without
food or sleep until he gets to his destina-
tion. He is no doubt in a state of
hypnosis, like the respectable citizen who
eats candles at a mesmerist’s seance,

“S.T.S.”: Last year I said to a promi-
nent American lecturer here, “Now’s your
time to explain to us the real difference
between a Democrat and a Republican.
All Americans are republicans as a fact
and, I suppose, all are democrats. And
not one Australian in a hundred knows
the difference. What is it?” Another
American standing by said, “I don’t think
one American in a hundred really knows
either.” So X got no further. Yet the
recent U.S. elections made a very real
issue of the difference —whatever it may
be.

“Hackshaw”: “Babylon’s” theory (B.
13/11/ ’46) that the Bard, writing at a
time when boys took women’s parts,
simplified his acting problem by giving
the men all the complicated emotions
and making his females merely decor-
ative, simple and charming seems a bit
far-fetched. Is the character of Lady
Macbeth any less complex than her hus-
band’s and is it written with any less
intensity of feeling? Is Cleopatra a less
living portrait of a woman than Antony
of a man, and —although it is only a
vignette—is Ophelia less the picture of a
well-brought-up young high-school lady
with a soul in a state of conflict than
Hamlet is a picture of a young man torn
between his beliefs and feelings? Freud
thought both characters worthy of study.
Shakspeare was an artist who was trying
to describe life in terms of his own ex-
perience, and if “Babylon” thinks he was
bothering about the limitations of boy
actors let him read “Richard III,” Act I,
Scene 11. If he can show any difference
in wildness, violence and passion, not to
mention ferocity of language, between
Lady Anne and Richard I’ll play the
Nurse in “Romeo and Juliet.”

“Hammt”: The family was a strong
influence in the theatrical life of a former
day, and it was not only evident in the
family groups that appeared before the
footlights. Backstage it was a common-
place to find a baby lying on half a dress-
basket converted into a cradle in its
mother’s dressing-room. Other members
of the company kept an eye on the infants
while mum and dad did their bits before
the footlights. The habit of making the
dressing-room a nursery led to at least
one contretemps. Toddler, left asleep,
awoke and decided to explore. Dad, as
the dashing hero, had taken the heroine
in his arms. “You are the only woman
I have ever loved,” he declared. Then
the toddler made his entrance with a rush.
“Daddy!” he cried joyfully. The curtain
came down with the whole house rocking
with laughter,

“Mark Time”; Isn’t sport sacred ? The
main-road authorities decreed the re-
sumption of 18 feet off the front of our
allotments to widen the road. There was
a burst of protest from residents, who,
having striven hard for homes, didn't
appreciate being deprived of their little
front gardens. Across the other side of
the road was the golfcourse. “Couldn’t
you take the 18 feet off the golfcourse?”
asked a member of a deputation from
the residents. “It would make very little
difference to the course, but it makes a
big difference to small allotments.”
Officialdom raised its hands in horror at
the thought.
“Wusslean”: Two years ago I bought
a block of land, and in eagerness to get
a home started I had draft plans prepared
at once, and got a promise of immediate
commencement by a builder. The Gov-
ernment stepped in and demanded that I
fill in a form relating to purchase of the
land. What they did with the form I do
not know, but after three months I was
informed that the sale was not approved.
Months later I found another block and
a willing vendor, filled in another form,
and after 10 weeks received approval for
the purchase. By this time I had'been
abandoned by the builder, and the ori-
ginal plans had to be scrapped on account
of the size of the block. At length I won
the favor of another builder, had new
plans prepared and approved by the
council, and the other day I confidently
approached the Government-sponsored
building society. “All you have to do
now,” they said,' “is to fill in a form for
the Government” “I’ll fill in a dozen,
with pleasure,” said I. “Very sorry, sir,”
they replied, “we’ve been out of forms
for weeks. But the Government Printer
promises to have them any day now/’

“8.J.L.”: Malapropisms from sar-
majors, is it (B. 6/11/ ’46)? Our R.S.M.
would take some beating. One afternoon,
he stood the squad at ease, and gazed at
two Spitfires cavorting above. “Great
fighters,” he remarked, “tough little
planes with marvellous removability.” An-
other time he caught a sentry outside
the Q-store in conversation with a friend.
Charging down upon the pair, he bel-
lowed, “Hi, soldier, don’t you know it’s
strictly forbidden to converge with
sentries?”

“Smouge”: My mate Cassidy, once a
policeman, now a petty-officer R.A.N.,
prides himself on his memory for faces.
Invited to dinner at a sergeants’ mess
we found ourselves alongside the colonel,
as guests of honor, and Cassidy monopo-
lised the colonel. “I know your face,”
he said. “Was it in the Middle East?” he
ventured. “Yes, I was there,” says the
colonel. “Syria?” queries Cassidy. “1
was in Syria for some time,” replies the
colonel. I could see that Cassidy was
stumped for once when he said, “No, it
wasn’t there. You didn’t happen to run
a fruit barrow before the war, did you?”

“Looby”: I met a dyed-in-the-wool
pessimist today. He said, “In two years
Japan will have Australia. In three years
Russia will have Japan. And in 10 years
America will have everything.” I nodded
with appropriate misery and then said as
a bright afterthought, “And what will
Britain be doing?” He shook his head
sadly. “No Britain! ”he commented, and
explained with a tragic sweep of his
hands, “Tidal wave!”
OVER THE ODDS.
“Actors’ Equity has asked stage artists all over
the Commonwealth to hold meetings to protest against
the statement of E. J. Tait that ‘Australian actors
and actresses are lazy, suffer from an inferiority
complex and will not do their best unless supported
by imported artists.’
Truly a bit of unprovoked aggression,
An unexpectedly offensive knock
At modern votaries of the profession
Connected with the buskin and the sock.
Whatever derelictions in your mind you ve
Got, Mr. Tait, to chuck this off your chest,
I’ll bet it won’t be long before you find you ve
Stirred up a hornets’ nest.
From vaudeville comedians to the ballet.
From every pub where mummers quench their
thirst, . ...
You’ll make indignant voices rise and rally
In hot defence of those whom you ve aspersed.
What tongue-bangings you’ve earned, what
vicious servings
Of any condiment that stings and smarts,
Who’ve dared traduce our land’s incipient
Irvings
And inchoate Bernhardts!
No actresses, you might have known, or actors,
From leading ladies down to Roman mobs,
Expect to find defamers and detractors
In those to whom they largely look for jobs.
And many an honest pro. and footlights beauty,
Reading the phrases in which you reflect
On them, might fairly mutter El tu, Brute!
Or words to that effect.
Have they deserted us, the drama’s Muses,
Think you, Thalia and Melpomene?
Firmly and resolutely one refuses
To credit any such calamity.
And now from every house-of-call and dwelling
Where our Australian Thespians congregate
One seems to hear impassioned voices yelling
Anathemas at Tait.

Starvation and Neglect.
“Ek Dum”: This is from Mr. Chifley’s
Budget speech:
On present plans the strength of the
three services, which was 137,000 in June
this year, will have been reduced to 67,000
in June, 1947. During the present interim
period the defence forces will be limited
lo I ? ainta i nin S the Australian component
of the British Commonwealth Occupation
rorce in Japan, administrative and main-
tenance activities on the mainland, and a
nucleus of the permanent post-war forces.
It will take some time for the full effects
of scientific developments in the defence
field to be assessed and for the future
strength and arming of the forces to be
determined.
And the longer the better from Can-
berra s point of view, if the attitude of
Mr. Chifley and his aides (five of whom
are service Ministers!) means anything.
The longer they can defer answer-
ing the question of whether there is to be
compulsory training the more comfortable
they will feel.
The Estimates
The defence section of the Estimates
appears to be very much of a mystery
story, except in its revelations that this
country in a world reeking of rocket
and atom bombs —is to be reduced to
1939 standards of protection while the
“ Anyway, I proved the booby-trap Wasn't foolproof !”
Government waits to see what happens
to the atom.
The main difference is that it costs
several times more to be undefended in
1946-47 than in 1938-39, and that there
are to be lieut.-generals and air-marshals
where there were major-generals and vice-
marshals before World War 11.
This is not disparagement of lieut.-
generals and air vice-marshals. In the
miserably-paid Australian defence forces
one needs—especially when associating
with overseas officers —to be at least a
lieut.-general to live.
Parliament is not informed in the Esti-
mates, as it used to be, what pay is set
aside for each rank in the services. The
pay schedules are a blank, though a, note
appears at the bottom of each page;
Pay and allowances in respect of the
above positions are fixed by the Military
and Financial Regulations under the De-
fence Act. The positions shown are the
permanent establishment on the basis of
the pre-war organisation of the Department'.
Poor Pay
This pay establishment is not encourag-
ing to the aspiring commander. The
Chief of the Naval Staffis the best paid
—but he is a British officer on loan, and
is remunerated by Admiralty standards at
£3OOO p.a., with allowances —£1000
a year more than the Chief of the
General Staff,
In the R.A.N. second-class commo-
dores get £4 ss. per day ; captains, £3 155.,
commanders, £2 125.; lieut.-commanders,
£1 145.; lieutenants, £1 45.; sub-lieu-
tenants, 11s., “according to pre-war
standard” —these are all executive deck
officers. Paymaster-captains get only
£3 10s. per day according to the 1938-39
schedules. Commissioned gunners run
to a mere £1 ss. Service pay, as pre-
scribed by the Naval Financial regula-
tions, according to seniority and class of
rating, ranges from Is. 9d. to 14s. 6d.
Petty officers are round the 17s. 6d. mark.
Before the war the Chief of the General
Staff on the military side was a major-
general whose salary was such as a de-
partmental manager in a ragshop might
expect, £l4OO a year. He drew £4OO a
year less than the civilian secretary to the
department. The holder of the job now
is a lieut.-general on £2OOO a year—much
less than the salary paid to the manager
of the newly-established Commonwealth
Air Services or even to the Ministers to
Moscow and Brazil, or the High Commis-
sioner to Eire, each of whom receives
£2500, as will Mr. Forde at Ottawa.
The salary of a major-general remains
at £l4OO and of a brigadier at £lOO0 —
yes, the commandant of the Royal Mili-
tary College is still on £lOOO a year or
thereabouts. A daily-newspaper reporter
earns that amount these days. It is note-
worthy that the assistant civilian secre-
tary to the Defence Division of the
Treasury gets £1422.
In 1939-40 the pay of the Aus-
tralian Staff Corps—five major-generals,
five brigadiers, six colonels, 39 lieut.-
colonels and 289 majors, captains and
lieutenants (including about £7OOO in
staff and command pay)—totalled
£178,001.
The R.A.A.F. before the war used to
sport two air vice-marshals whose total
salaries were £3502, against the one who
had earned £1750 the year before, “in-
cluding £250 as Chief of the Air Staff.”
There is now a Chief of the Air Staff at
£1769. Air-commodores draw down
something over £9OO a year. The total
salaries of 281 officers in the general-
duties branch in 1939-40 was £138,000.
The general standards of pay are the
most miserable in the world. For pur-
poses of comparison a lieut.-commander
in the Royal Navy under the scale
of pay established early this year earns
over £BOO a year against the £1 14s. a
day paid to lieut.-commanders here. And
the British officer has handsome family-
endowment allowances and operates
under a generous pension system which
does not exist in Australia.
The British full colonel or naval cap-
tain of three years standing has about
£l7OO a year under the new scale—nearly
twice that of an Australian full colonel.
It is better to be a colonel in the British
Army or a captain in a cruiser on
foreign service than it is to be Chief of
the Australian General Staff. It is better
to be a major in the Royal Engineers on
service in the Indian outback than it is
to be a major-general in command of a
great Australian military district in peace-
time, apart from pension considerations.
An Australian general with long and dis-
tinguished service can expect to retire
on something less than the pension of
a N. S. Wales police inspector.
Though the pay of the rank and file is
proportionately much better by compari-
son with rank-and-file pay in other
countries, it is still a pittance, having re-
gard to the quality of the men required,
compared with the pay of wharflaborers.

plies vainly for hire ... even to-day some building owners inflict
the horrors of bird-cage lift service upon their tenants—tenants by
necessity rather than choice.
Building owners who look to the future, who desire permanent tenants
and satisfactory rentals, should take advantage of the Waygood-Otis
Modernisation Plan. Under this plan,
Waygood-Otis engineers will first
make a thorough examination of your
lift equipment . . . will show you just
what is needed to give your buildings
modern service . . . there is no obli-

work of modernisation is carried out
step by step without confusion or
dislocation to tenants until your lifts
become as modern in every respect
as a new installation.
Waygood-Otis engineers in every
State will gladly give you details of
this progressive Plan.

Some of the inflation is due to extra
work entailed in current demobilisation
and in servicing the force in Japan.
Compulsory training is, of course, mori-
bund. Recruiting is dead as a doornail,
neither quantity nor quality coming for-
ward. In Australia the only forces in
existence outside the “permanents” men-
tioned above as provided for are bodies
of troops engaged in dismantling or wind-
ing up bases or in the process of demobi-
lisation, which is being hastened by the
dental propensities of the new Minister.
Mr. Chambers is drawing teeth from the
Army at a great rate.
Mr. Menzies’s Comments
Mr. Menzies in Parliament last week
pretty accurately pointed the position:
Tlfe Government’s attitude seems to be
that until the implications of the atom
bomb have been examined, in addition to
the future of all guided projectiles, it is
premature to lay down plans for actual
defence forces of the Commonwealth. The
Opposition realises that all those impli-
cations must be examined, but' at the same
time believes that no examination is
likely to lead to the conclusion that there
is no need fo establish a Navy, Army
and Air Force for Australia. Substantially
the only Interim Defence Force is the
Army of Occupation [i.e., a couple of
brigades] now in Japan. The R.A.A.F.
appears to be in the process of disin-
tegration. If there is any more dawdling
it will be necessary to build up an Air
Force from scratch.
Mr. Menzies might have added that
Australia is the only country which has
not moved to inaugurate its new scheme.
As far back as August last the confer
ence of Imperial officers, held at Cam-
berley (at which Australia was repre-
sented), formulated the new code of
principles of war on which the Field
Service Regulations will be based. Britain
has since announced that conscription
will be retained, and the principles of
naval building as altered by current in-
ventions are already in practice.
The United States as well as Britain
has in the air machines which make the
shattered remnants of the R.A.A.F. look
like something from Noah’s junk heap.
But “Labor” is committed to the old
policy of the hollow log. Defence seems
due for its normal peace-time fate of
starvation and neglect.
Admiral Nimitz.
So soon as the Pacific war ended it
was here suggested that Admiral Nimitz,
as the main organiser of victory in the
Pacific —seeing that the Pacific war was
in the main a naval war and that all
the actions of decisive importance were
fought under the naval command-
should be invited to Australia to receive
the thanks of Parliament.
It was the forces under Admiral Nimitz
that made Guadalcanal possible ; that won
the of the Coral Sea and Mid-
way and the important one in the
Solomons in November, 1942, which
threw the Japanese fleet out of the Gil-
berts and the Marshalls—the forces that
beat the enemy off Leyte, established the
bases within reach of Japan, destroyed
the China coast defence and invested and
arranged the landings on Okinawa.
Finally it was Admiral Nimitz and his
men who battered Japan into a state of
internal ruin, in which the whole of the
great cities and bases were from 60 per
cent, to 100 per cent, wrecked, with the
exception of Kyoto.
The Government did not at that stage
feel that any ceremonial thanks were due
to the resolute old commander who did
his job without advertising and without
fuss, and whose communiques always
understated his achievements in measured
terms.
But last week the Minister of Exter-
nal Affairs suddenly became afflicted with
a grateful thought. It came to him while
he was talking to Mr. Butler, the Ameri-
can Minister: “Why not invite Admiral
Nimitz to visit Australia?”
The press hailed it as a typically bril-
liant emanation of the genius of Dr. Evatt.
Rockets in Australia.
“Ek Dum”: After months of leaky
silence during which most of the facts
became known, the Government has an-
nounced that the British-Australian
guided-projectile rocket range will be*
located at Mt. Eba, in northern South
Australia, and that the range will be built
in three stages and will cost £6,000,000.
The organisation of the first experi-
ments, ovet about 300 miles, will be-
gin so soon as Major-General Evetts, of
the British Army, who will come “as a
civilian,” arrives in Australia, A further
stage to the coast of W.A. —1100 miles —
will later be organised and eventually the
projectiles will be aimed at Christmas
Island, 3000 miles from Mt, Eba.
Mt. Eba is a desert station 60 miles
north of the East-West railway, and is
on about 30 degrees south —roughly on a
line which runs through North Bourke
(N.S.W.). It is a refuelling stop for
Guinea Airways on the run from Adel-
aide to Alice Springs.
Country being reserved for range
purposes is 200 miles wide in a rectangle,
the sides of which are drawn from Shell-
borough, 50 miles or so north-east of
Port Hedland (W.A.), and Broome.
Though a corner of the Northern Terri-
tory is included, the direct route of the
projectiles (which will be little deviated
from) will be entirely in South and West
Australia, all the way to the coast, after
which it crosses 1900 miles of open
ocean, finishing up in an island at lOdeg.
31mih., s. lat., and 105 deg. 34min., e.
long., and about 200 miles south of the
western end of Java.
The advent of these experiments
should be a warning to the country of
the fact that its isolation for defence
purposes has disappeared. Also that the
East Indies and New Guinea have ac-
quired a new importance, transcending
that of almost any other area in the
western Pacific.
A 3000-mile radius circle drawn round
Sourabaya, in Java, embraces Queensland
and N. S. Wales ; indeed, the whole of
Australia save the south-eastern bit south-
east of a line drawn from Grafton to
Melbourne, but 100 miles on to the range
will remedy that.
A 3000-mile range from Sourabaya
also takes in all China south of the Yellow
Sea, the whole of Indo-China, Burma
and Malaya, Calcutta, Ceylon, the East
Indies, the Philippines and all the Jap
Pacific mandated islands, save the Mar-
shalls, It embraces Kyushu in Japan.
In a world in which rockets have a
3000-mile range the Dutch East Indies
becomes strategically the centre of the
Pacific-Indian Ocean area with an im-
mensely-increased importance.
This no doubt explains why the Com-
munist party, whose agents were dis-
covered to be the centre of a treasonable
plot in Canada, and whose whole execu-
tive in South Africa has been arrested on
charges of sedition, should be so eager to
see Indonesia removed from control of
the friendly Dutch and handed over to
a pliant native administration, friendly
to and honeycombed with Communists.
The area of the rocket range on Aus-
tralian soil will be about 200,000 square
miles. It is all desert, or nearly so, and
virtually uninhabited. The number of
blacks in it would not.be one to 500
square miles, and most of them are in
known areas. The Communist-generated
scare about the danger to these poor
harmless people is, as usual, moonshine,
except in so far as it was designed to
hamper a British Commonwealth defence
project and extract information about it
for the benefit of Moscow and to the
detriment of its success.
Even if rocket-firing was not an
accurate art —in the crude days of 1944,
the Germans were placing their rocket
bombs with fair accuracy in a half-mile-
square block of London from the con-
tinent —the chances of death which the
abo. runs in the area are one-fiftieth of
those run by the ordinary Sydney pedes-
trian crossing Pitt-street on a busy after-
noon.

SHERRY
PERSONAL ITEMS
Target of more unmerited abuse than
any other man in the Commonwealth at
the present time is Edmund Alfred Drake-
Brockman, of the Commonwealth Arbi-
tration Court. Before he was sentenced to
the slow torture of listening to intermin-
able pleas on the Arbitration Bench —
nearly 20 years ago—he had been in turn
barrister, soldier and Senator and had
made a pretty good fist of all three. Born
at Busselton (W.A.) he went away to the
Kaiser’s war as a company commander
of the 11th Battalion, took part in the
Landing at Gallipoli and was seriously
wounded in France in 1916. The same
year he was given command of the 18th
Battalion, and by the end of the scrap
he was leading the Fourth Brigade. ' His
war service entitles him to tack to his
name C. 8., C.M.G., D. 5.0., and what-
ever letters go with the Montenegrin
Order of Danilo, and he was mentioned
in dispatches six times. In 1919 he was
elected to the Senate and stayed there
- till 1926, becoming Government Whip.
Another Judge who has been in the
news lately is Justice Dunphy, President of
the W.A. Arbitration Court, who in pass-
ing sentence on officials and 22 members
of a striking union referred to their hold-
up of 1 transport in the West as “the most
unjustified strike of which I have ever
heard.” The accusation that he is a
crusty old dodderer can scarcely be
levelled against Edward Arthur Dunphy
—he’s not yet 40. Before he was ele-
vated to the Bench he was W.A. Crown
Solicitor at 30 and a K.C. at 37.
Bishop Stephen Davies, of Carpentaria,
who is trying to get things shipshape in
his Thursday Island headquarters as well
as . , a * Darwin and other outposts, is
raising strong protest against the con-
ditions under which aboriginal labor is
used in the N.T. During his 24 years
in Carpentaria, the Bishop has steadily
battled for a better understanding of
native rights and conditions; and has
also been out for a better spin for the
“Euralian.” Recently he was in holts
with the Navy over its retention of the
church at Darwin, taken over in war-time,
and away back in the ’twenties he fought
hard trying to persuade Canberra that
Japanese aspirations regarding North
Australia were not all fantastic stories.
A sturdy champion of the outback he has
done ‘a good deal of campaigning for
better radio communication, medical
services and educational facilities.
John Brennan on a Yankee seadog:
Australians should like what they see of
Admiral Chester W. Nimitz if anything comes
of the suggested invitation that he should
visit the country. He is very much the old
seadog - weatherbeaten and with his eyes
screwed in and shadowed by his brows, forth-
right and quickly decisive, with a shy, hesitant
friendliness. He can tell a good story. He
visited Guam as theatre commander during
the last days of the campaign (here and had
a group of 20 or so correspondents to a
conference with the Marine General Command-
ing, Roy S. Geiger. When it was over and
the correspondents were leaving the tent NinSltz
“pooled” Geiger very nicely. “Did you boys
know the general had got on to a dump of
Jap whisky?” he asked. Geiger couldn’t but
share it. He handed over one of the cases
from behind his bunk. “It’s good whisky,
too,” said Nimitz. “It reminded me of a
story they used to tell in prohibition days.
A doctor had got hold of half-a-dozen bottles
labelled Bourbon. He tried one of them, then
decided to change his bootlegger. He was
taking the other bottles downstairs to destroy
them when he met the negro janitor and changed
his mind. Next morning he asked the janitor
what he thought of the whisky. ‘Well, suh,
it’s perfect,’ said the janitor, ‘What do you
mean, “perfect”?’ asked the doctor. ‘Well,
suh, if it was any better you wouldn’t have
given it to me, and if it was any worse /
couldn’t have drunk it.’ This Jap stuff’s good,”
said Nimitz. “It’s better than perfect, anyway.”
It was.
Invested with the 0.8. E. in Melbourne
by the Duke of Gloucester, Wing-Com-
mander Donald Thomson already holds
a mort of decorations —mostly for science.
He is D.Sc. Melb., Dip. Anthrop.
F.R.C.S., Research Fellow in Anthrop.
Melbourne University, and has been
offered a Fellowship at Cambridge for his
work amongst the Australian abos. Born
in 1901 in Melbourne, he had a distin-
guished career at the Universities of
Sydney, Cambridge and Melbourne,
where he was a pupil of that famous
anatomist Wood Jpnes. But he was no
mere scholar —there was a strong strain
of adventure in him. Twice when there
were disturbances amongst the North
Queensland Binghis he was commissioned
by the Commonwealth to live alone with
the natives and learn about their prob-
lems. It was his knowledge of native races
gained at first-hand which got him a com-
mission jtn the Air Force, and landed him
on special missions in enemy-occupied
territory in New Guinea. Badly smashed
up on one of these he was invalided back
to Australia, but, though a cot case, he
succeeded in getting his collection of
native implements transported with him.
“Pookie”; Lyndon Dadswell’s success
in the competition for a design for the
Sydney memorial to King George V has
a personal interest for me that has noth-
ing to do with the artistic merit of his
monolith. At Beit Jirja, in Palestine,
Dadswell was, for a time, my platoon
sergeant. We were reinforcements for
the 2/3rd Battalion, waiting to join the
unit in Egypt. In the somewhat fretful
atmosphere of a training camp Dadswell
showed himself a good soldier, and, what
is rarer, a good handler of men. From
mutual acquaintances I learned that he
had given up the chance of an O.T.S.
rather than miss his draft. Dadswell
spoke Arabic, as well as several Euro-
pean languages—he had been in the
Middle East before and had push-biked
around Europe, working his way and
staying long enough to browse and study
in any place of artistic interest. Also, he
had lived in London, sufficient cause for
prestige to the youthful. His conversa-
tional style of teaching was very effective.
After his return from a school in Egypt
he passed on some of the more important
lectures—one on Tactics and Strategy by
Wavell, in particular—to the platoon in
a form which they could all readily
assimilate. Going to another unit, I saw
nothing more of Dadswell until I met
him in Sydney. My last vivid recollec-
tion of him is a terrific minor row which
arose over an orange-stealing episode on
a route march. On that occasion, quite
unnecessarily, Dadswell took the blame.
Also, I think, he paid the enraged Wog.
Samuel Walder, dead in Sydney at 67,
had one thing in common with Omar
Khayydm—both were tent-makers. His-
tory does not record whether the tents
turned out by the Persian poet were
good, bad or indifferent, but there can
be no two opinions about the Walder
article —any Digger will testify that,
whatever the shortcomings of other items
of equipment, the Australian tent was in
a class of its own. Walder took over his
father’s canvas business at 18 and built
it up into a big concern. He was 13
years on the Sydney City Council, was
Lord Mayor in 1932, the year of the
opening of the Harbor Bridge, and was
knighted in 1933. He was on the boards
of several public companies, and was an
M.L.C. for many years.
Harold B. Morgan, appointed this
year to the job of manager, head office,
of the Commercial Banking Co.
of Sydney, has spent the whole of his
BANK MANAGER.
working life in the service of the bank.
This is not intended as a reflection on the
state of his garden, which is well up to
Roseville standards. Born at Boorowa
N.S.W., Morgan, sketched here by
Dubois, joined the bank in 1903, saw
service in several country branches, be-
came manager of the Campsie branch,
and 20 years ago settled in head office,
being appointed secretary in 1938
Morgan represented his State at tennis in
younger days, and is a keen fisherman ;
tor 15 years he has played bridge once a
week with his fishing associates. It is
generally considered that in fishing, as in
bridge, he observes the conventions.
‘Bo” salutes a departed composer :
cuJi? e J e^ th Manuel de Falla a few days
ot his 70th birthday has robbed Spanish
music of its most celebrated modern creator
P i° pa . gan , dlst - Born in Cadiz, De Falla
studied at the Madrid Conservatory under
Felipe Pedrell. London- heard him in 1911
as a virtuoso of the keyboard after he had
u- 01 L T a competition for national opera with
his La Vida Breve,” the Spanish Dance No. 1
From which, transcribed for violin and piano by
Fritz Kreisler, is a well-known recorded piece.
•i n Fans, De Falla came strongly,, under the
influence of the French school, then headed
by Ravel and Debussy. At the outbreak of
war m 1914 he returned to Spain and settled
in Granada, where most of his best works
were composed. Among those was “El Amor
Bruj9 (roughly translated, “The Love
Magician”), a monumental work in 12 sections,
based on folk tales of Andalusia. It is best
known to concert audiences for one of its
constituent pieces, the “Ritual Fire Dance,”
often given an airing by Australian orchestras.
One of De Falla’s ballets, “The Three-Cornered
Hat, was a favorite of the famous dancer
and choreographer Diaghilev. His best purely
orchestral piece was r ‘Nights in the Gardens
of Spain,” a sonorous work ornamented with
florid cadences.
De Falla’s idiom, like that of his earlier
compatriots Albeniz and Granados, was founded
on the folk music of Andalusia, in which
sensuous rhythm surges into the hot-blooded,
corybantic dance. Of the three, De Falla’s
music has the greatest individualism. In 1939,
being opposed to Franco, he left Spain and
settled m Argentina. In him the nationalist
renaissance of Spanish music was crystallised,
and with his passing there is no successor in
sight to carry on the tradition.
Key man in Queensland’s new £ 19-
million works programme is John Robert
Kemp, Victorian-born and a graduate
of Melbourne University. Now 63, he
went to Queensland in 1920 as Main
Roads Director after extensive civil-en-
. gineering experience with the Victorian
Roads Commission. Now he holds down
11 jobs without apparent effort, being
simultaneously Co-ordinator-General of
Public Works, Commissioner of Main
Roads, a member of the Bureau of In-
dustry, chairman of four of that bureau’s
special boards, chairman of the. Bureau
of Investigation of Land and Water
Resources, chairman of the Burde-
kin River Bridge Board, a member
of the University Senate and a
member of the Faculty of Engineering.
A quiet-spoken man of sympathetic
understanding and courteous manner, he
is, despite his Pooh-Bah multiplicity of
offices, the very antithesis of the popular
conception of a bureaucrat.
Wilfred H. Frederick, M.A., Dip. Ed.,
who, at 45, succeeds the late N. H. Mac-
Neil as head of Wesley College, Mel-
bourne, is probably the first headmaster
to gain a reputation as a radio broad-
caster. x For the past 13 years he has been
heard by thousands of school-kids who
have never seen him. A specialist in
modern languages, he planned and man-
aged the French broadcasts which have
made the learning of that language almost
a pleasure to children, not only in Vic-
toria but all over the Commonwealth.
Son of a parson, he was educated at
Castlemaine and Geelong High Schools
and at the Universities of Melbourne and
Paris. He has travelled in Italy, Germany,
Switzerland and Austria, and in 1930
was teaching at Watford Boys’
Grammar School in England. He is
senior lecturer in education at Melbourne
Uni., and a member of the staff of Uni-
versity High School in charge of modern
languages. His wife was educated at the
Methodist Ladies’ College and taught
music. He’s a good hand at tennis, was
in the winning A-grade pennant team
in 1932, and has repped for Victoria.
Economics and mathematics have been
food and drink to L. G. Melville ever
since he was old’enough to choose his
own diet. Sydney born, he left the staff
of the N.S.W. Public Actuary to become
Public Actuary of S.A. He was then 22
and was not much older when Adelaide
’Varsity made him its Professor of Eco-
nomics. He didn’t stay long. Impressed
by his work in preparation of the case
for S.A.’s disabilities, the Commonwealth
Bank in 1931 asked the ’Varsity for the
loan of Melville for a year. He became
the bank’s economic adviser, and is that
still. He led the Australian delegation at
Bretton Woods. Federal Cabinet’s decision
to ratify the B.W. agreement, arrived at
in the face of considerable Left-wing
opposition, is a tribute to Melville’s repu-
tation as a financial authority.
While Montgomery was planning “D-
Day” a grim-visaged Lancashireman was
M.C.C. MANAGER.
planning “A-Day”—when, with a team
of M.G.C. stalwarts, he would again
trip to Australia to wipe out an old
smudge. Major Rupert Howard, man-
ager, guide, philosopher and good friend
to Hammond’s team, here Coventrated,
visited Australia in 1936-7 as manager
of “Gubby” Allen’s XI, and, when Eng-
land was two up with three to go, there
were whoops that the Ashes were ready
for a trip in the carpet-bag to Blighty.
Then the ’Roo’s tail wagged and Eng-
land lost the other matches by 365, 148,
and an innings and 200 runs. Crest-
fallen a wee bit, Howard was not down-
hearted. He had to wait till World War
II got off the fields; and “A-Day” or
“Ashes-Day” is now. Like “Plum”
Warner, Howard is a fine ambassador,
knows all the answers to cricket prob-
lems, and can express them very ably.
While pressmen and people were cogitat-
ing over the standard of the extra
matches to fill in time in Westralia,
Howard promptly declared they were to
be regarded as official matches of the
tour. Way back in 1922 he donned pads
for Lancashire in county matches until
a knee injury pushed him among the
barrackers. Howard is 56 and is secre-
tary of Lancashire C.C.
The name of Smith, Johnson and Go.
ranks high among public accountants in
Australia. Frederick James Smith, dead
in Sydney at 74, was the senior partner
of the firm, and “Mr. Constable” was
the pseudonym under which, as owner or
part-owner, he raced a lot of good horses,
the greatest of them Ajax, F.J. was born
at Mulgrave (N.S.W.), and founded his
accountancy practice at 21. He was on
the boards of many public companies,
among them Australian Consolidated
Industries, Qantas Empire Airways, Dun-
lop Rubber and Hordern Brothers. He
imported many thoroughbreds from
Britain and France; they included
Medmenham, dam of Ajax, and Gene-
tout, sire of Columnist.
Into the silence:
In Brisbane, at 86, Canon W. P. Oakley.
Born in Monmouthshire, he graduated M.A.
at Oxford and was ordained in 1886 and came
to Australia in 1900 as rector of Holy Trinity,
Woolloongabba. Later he had a parish in
Toowoomba for 24 years and before his retire-
ment was associated with St. John’s Cathedral,
Brisbane.
In Hollywood, at 66, Donald Meek, stage
and screen actor. In recent years he had been
typed for parts that suited equally his appear-
ance and his name, but in his time he had
played over 800 stage parts and appeared in
more than 100 films. As a child he visited
Australia in “Little Lord Fauntleroy.”
In New York, at 65, Jimmie Walker, one-
time colorful Mayor of that city. He became
Mayor midway through the 1920’s when pro-
hibition rackets were approaching their peak
and the boom that preceded the bust was
developing, and was in many ways a typical
figure of the period.


Women's letters
From Sydney
Music-lovers the State over are rub-
bing their hands with pleasure over the
appointment of Eugene Goossens to the
directorship of the Conservatorium. The
distinguished British (though naturalised
American) conductor will also hold the
position of resident conductor of the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra, salary for
the combined task being £5OOO. But
Eugene will have to possess the strength
of 10 if he is expected to direct even
half the number of orchestral concerts
programmed for this year well over
one hundred. The Goossens couple made
many friends during their recent stay
in Australia. They went to all the
musical parties arranged in their honor,
always looked happy to be there, and
she was always exquisitely dressed, Mr.
Goossens is one of the world’s famous
conductors. He has been for the past
15 years director of the Cincinnati
orchestra.
A letter written in the Queen Eliza-
beth by Mrs. Goossens to a Sydney
friend and posted the ninth of this
month reached Sydney last week. In it
she tells of a glorious passage from Eng-
land to New York in the great liner, in
which everything is perfect. The decora-
tions call for a special word, and
the food she describes as “unequalled
anywhere at the present time.” Clothes
worn by the women evoke a long
note of admiration from Mrs. Goos-
sens. Among the passengers were
the British mannequins going to
America to display models by the great
English houses, crowds of French women,
film star Joan Bennett and the Duke and
Duchess of Windsor. Mrs. Goossens
tells of a saddened England. She adds
that the Sydney orchestra could hold its
own with any she and her husband had
heard in England.
Never did more brilliant and more
varied flowers come to the city than
those for the wedding of Elaine Hoskins,
of Invergowrie, Exeter, and Robert Tay-
lor. The gardens of the bride’s home are
famed (part of the estate was once
owned by seed merchant Yates). If you
were passing Macquarie House in Mac-
quarie-street last Wednesday the fra-
grance of the massed gladioli, roses, water-
lily, rhododendron, peony and the cool
and fragile lily-of-the-valley would have
lured you to peep into the reception
rooms, where the bride’s table was being
decorated. Its blooms were white water-
lily, lily-of-the-valley and white and
faintly-pink rhododendron. The effect of
the famous lace tablecloth, which has
been spread on so many bridal tables in
Sydney (in the days when Mrs. Hall ran
Elizabeth Bay House), was just right for
the three-tiered cake, lacy with decora-
tion, snowy with icing, on which were
scrolled lily and palely-blue true-lover’s
knot.
The bride, Elaine Hoskins, was slim
in her off-white moire wedding frock
made with a bustle effect —with an Old
Victorian period arrangement of flowers
on the bustle. Her bouquet was un-
usual—peonies and rhododendrons in the
same tonings as the frock. Bridesmaids
were charming; the guests —200 of them
—in festive attire were city and country
well-knowns. There was a great outburst
of clapping when Elaine and bridegroom
Robert Taylor were chaired down the
old-fashioned stairway. The bride’s
parents are the Cecil Hoskins. The
’groom’s people are the P. J. Taylors of
engineering renown.
The Harry Gullett lady, who comes to
Sydney next week for a holiday, already
has a long list of parties arranged in
her honor. One of the first of these is
an afternoon tea-party at Rosemont, the
Charles Lloyd Jones home at Woollahra.
Guest of a small P.E.N. lunch last week
was Mrs. Archdale, mother of the prin-
cipal of the Women’s College within the
University. But Mrs. Archdale was guest
in her own right. She was very active in
women’s movements in England, and was
for some years editor of “Time and Tide.”
The idea behind the title is of course:
“Time and Tide Waiteth for No Man.”
Mrs. Archdale is tall and attractive, and is
very interested in the work of children’s
libraries. Former Municipal Librarian
Bertie and she had quite a get-to-
gether over the subject.
Sydney water-colorists have been keep-
ing the lift busy whizzing up to the
Grosvenor Galleries. Here Beatrice
Kelly (Mrs. J. M. McPhillamy)- is show-
ing glimpses of the Bowral and Moss
Vale landscape. The McPhillamys, who
used to live up Bathurst way, have lived
in Moss Vale for some time; hence
such glimpses as “Cavalcade,” which
shows a group of riders on a treedined
road. Beatrice, who is a daughter
of the Bertie Kellys, studied her
art in Florence, but no nostalgia for
the Italian view tinges this show. Its
trees and its flowers belong to this land.
This painter’s flowers have a just-plucked
quality that appeals. This gazer’s choice
is “The Persimmon Tree,” so full of
grace. The show was opened last week
to a fashionable audience by Mrs. Charles
Lloyd Jones, The artist and her mother
were kept busy greeting friends and ad-
mirers. Before the end of the week most
of the pictures were sold.
There was a sombre quality about the
dressing at the concert in aid of the
Red Cross last week. There were even
empty seats in the Town Hall, but the
night was a sodden one, and that probably
explains the somewhat dank atmosphere.
However, some glitter and rustle were
supplied by the ladies of the committee
with their silk and lace frocks, smooth
coiffures and, in one instance, at least,
what the Girl in the Flat Opposite calls
“The Cape of Good Hope”—she hopes
she gets a fur one as good at some future
date. The Governor, Lieut.-General
Northcott, and daughter Elizabeth came.
Captain Tony Findlay was in attendance.
The portrait of David Stewart, a virile
and characteristic study unveiled at the
Workers Educational Association annual
dinner, is by Mary M. Abbott, pictured
here. Mary started her school days at
the Quirindi Rural School. Even then
she showed her talent. An inspector of
the Education Department advised her
parents to allow her to study art, and
Mary’s aunt, Louise Jopling, R.A., backed
up this opinion. Mary became first a
student and then a teacher (at seventeen) at
the Sydney Commercial Art School. Then
followed some years at the Julian Ashton
Art School, travel in Europe and more
study in the Chiswick Polytechnic. Mary
is known as a painter of landscape and
portraits, and her illustrations for chil-
dren’s books are full of charm. A.
D’Ombrain’s O Nita Rinkus is one of
the books adorned by her drawings.
The great blazing chandelier was in
place. It has modernised itself with a
platinum or rather chrome tint, where in
pre-war days it glinted copper. Joan
Hammond and Raymond Lambert were
the artists who poured their talents into
the Red Cross coffers, Joan’s frock was a
figure-clinging affair of white moire
spattered with blue flowers. Her sleeves
slit at the elbows flowed full, and showed
a lining blue as the flowers on her frock.
The only woman to accompany the
U.S. Davis Cup team to Australia is the
wife of player Frank Parker. She was a
sparkling and smart figure (despite an
air-travel-limited wardrobe) at the recep-
tion given in honor of the visiting team
last Saturday. Mrs. Parker was allowed
to accompany her husband because he
does not play nearly so well when she is
not with him. A great and glowing sheaf
of flowers was handed to Mrs. Parker by
Mrs. Rowland Conway, a councillor of
the N.S.W.L.T.A., as a tribute from all
the members of the Australian and
N.S.W. associations. Party was at the
Australia. Miss Dorothy Dingle, Mrs.
Lobban and Mrs. Spencer Nolan were
others of the sex sipping cocktails in this
otherwise sternly male atmosphere.
The Smilin’ Thru Club has decided on
a Harbor cruise, destination so far a
secret, for its New Year’s Eve revel in
aid of the Permanently and Totally Dis-
abled Soldiers appeal. A dashing motor-
ship will carry the merrymakers from
Circular Quay to a fairylike dell
where the Old Year will be sped and the
New Year greeted with song and dance.
One of the committee members, Mrs.
Jessica Lee, is giving a sherry party in
her Darling Point home to help expenses.
From Melbourne
State Governor Sir Winston Dugan and
Lady Dugan were guests of honor at the
Royal Empire Society luncheon in the
Town Hall. The vice-regals, together
with Viscount Dunwich, Mrs. J. Hasel-
den and Captain Blood, were received by
president of the society Thomas Nettle-
fold. Calceolarias and deep scarlet-
toned cinerarias formed the attractive
table decorations. Madge Elliott presented
Lady Dugan with a box of pastel-tinted
flowers which contrasted with the re-
cipient’s ffrock of brick-red wool that
matched fhe revers and lining of her
navy coat. In the considerable social
tonnage foregathered were representatives
of Bench and Bar and the three services
and their wives.
Mrs. David Griffiths, the subject of this
photo, by Edwin G. Adamson, is a mem-
ber of the committee which is sponsoring
a ball to be held in the St. Kilda Town
4 Hall on December 6. The cause is a
very worthy one: the Victorian Eye and
Ear Hospital. This will be the first ball
in connection with the hospital held since
the war, and there will be a debutante
set composed of nurses from the hospital.
The E. and E. Hospital has a dis-
tinguished matron, Miss Johns, who for
her service in the Middle East during the
war received the Royal Red Cross.
American Ambassador R. Butler broke
all records for speech brevity when he
replied to Lord Mayor Connelly’s speech
of welcome at the reception given in his
honor —it lasted just two minutes. His
wife captivated guests with her ready
smile and easy friendliness. Her two-
piece silk frock of deep mulberry tonings
with iridescent sequins on bodice and
short sleeves combined nicely with a tiny
hat of stiffened crinoline straw in the
same shade. Mrs. Richard Boyce, who
accompanied Mrs. Butler, wore a tailored
suit of grey striped in brown. Mrs, Butler
was greatly impressed with our roses,
declaring that they even outshone in
loveliness those grown in her home town
of Portland, Oregon, which has quite a
reputation for its roses. Margaret Saker
set off her hyacinth-blue ensemble with a
small hat trimmed with pastel roses, veiled
in white.
One of the first functions the Butlers
attended on arrival in Melbourne was a
dinner-party given by the Norman
Brookes cquple at their South Yarra
home, Kurneh, which during some of the
war years was occupied by the Red Cross
as a rest-home for officers of the three
services. Another was the late-afternoon
party given by the U.S. Military Attache,
Brigadier-General E. B. Sebree, and Mrs.
Sebree and the U.S. Naval Attache,
Captain B. F. Tompkins, and Mrs. Tomp-
kins, at the New Alexandra, East St.
Kilda. Here more than 200 guests were
presented to the Ambassador and his wife
in the ballroom, which was decorated
with the Australian and American flags
and bowls of tall massed gladioli, lupins
and delphiniums. Mrs. Butler graced the
occasion in a two-piece suit of black silk,
richly embroidered with red, green and
gold sequins on the shoulders. With it
she wore a small crownless hat of black
taffetta ribbon, relieved with touches of
pink and two large orchids pinned at the
neckline. A slim-fitting frock of gold-
toned crepe with fringes of the material
trimming the breast-pocket was worn by
Mrs. Sebree. Her corsage was of slipper
orchids. Mrs. Tompkins’s high-necked
frock of dull black satin was relieved with
a brilliant-red kid belt. Mrs. Richard
Boyce’s nigger-brown-striped cream linen
suit was worn with a cartwheel brown-
straw hat which matched her blouse.
With Major S. F. McDaniel, Assistant-
Military was his wife, whose
frock of pastel pink had bands of pink
and aqua-blue on the bodice and across
the shoulders. Her small half-hat was of
white straw petals, edged in pink. Mrs.
Moynahan, wife of the Assistant-Naval
Attache, Commander B. J. Moynahan,
wore a high-crowned corn-colored straw
hat with her deep mauve frock. Mrs.
J. S. Sauer had field flowers trimming
her small black hat, which was worn with
a black frock. Green veiling relieved the
simple black frock worn by Mrs.
Michaelis. Mrs. Bertie Hotchkiss’s large
black straw hat, trimmed simply with two
large pink roses, was worn with a black
frock. W. A. Bartlett came with his wife,
smart in a black frock.relieved by two
clips of topaz set in gold ; her mushroom
hat was of black felt. Attractive Martha
Sebree assisted her parents in hostessing,
and was clad in a simple white crepe
frock, the bodice criss-crossed in black
stripes.
Exotic fur wraps and beautiful gowns
marked the gala opening of “Gay Rosa-
linda” at His Majesty’s Theatre. Mrs.
Frank Watts covered her formal gown of
forget-me-not blue with a three-quarter-
length white ermine coat. Kathleen
Grant Hay, who wore a hip-length silver
fox cape with her black gown, came with
fiance Rupert Clarke. A full-length
coat of gold lame covered the beige
lace frock worn by Patricia Pappa-
dakas, who was with Charles Rowe.
Helen Lane’s white fox bolero was worn
over a pastel-blue frock. Distinctive was
the Norman Hartnell model cape, worn
by Mrs. Wallace Mitchell. Betty Stewart
wore an unusual mandarin coat of bright
scarlet embroidered in gold dragons over
her formal gown. Others who applauded
the bright show were Dr. and Mrs.
Bowen Allen, Mr. and Mrs. Don Sharp
(she is Gwenda Wilson, who starred in
“Kiss and Tell” and “The Hasty Heart”),
Viola Tait, whose turquoise gown was
beaded in white, Veronica Syme in
yellow-and-black plaid taffeta, and Julia
Mary Rouse in black taffeta.
A short but informative talk by Air
Vice-Marshal F. M. Bladin on life with
the occupation forces in Japan was a
feature of the first annual meeting of
the Australian Air Force Women’s Asso-
ciation held in the Gloucester Room at
the Australia. The president, Mrs. F. M.
Bladin, whose dusty-pink frock was high-
lighted with sequins in a deeper tone and
worn with a matching halo hat, received
and introduced Mrs. A. W. Coles, who
took the chair. During the afternoon a
cheque was presented to Mrs. G. Hen-
derson to help the work of the After-
Care Hospital. Mrs. A. Drakeford, her
silver-fox cape worn over a black frock,
was on hand to apologise for the in-
ability of her Minister-husband to be
present. Mrs. A. L. Walters, publicity
officer for the association, wore a large
upturned black hat, the brim lined with
teal blue, with her black frock. Mrs. R.
Williams, wife of Air Vice-Marshal Wil-
liams, was made the first life member of
the A.A.F.W.A.
A hard-working committee, with the
wife of the Vice-Chancellor of the Uni-
versity, Mrs. J. D. G. Medley, at the
helm, is going all out to make the Raisin
Fair a huge success. This will be held at
Grong Grong, Toorak, next Saturday,
November 30. Lady Dugan will perform
the opening ceremony, and the proceeds
will go towards the university which is
to be situated at Mildura. Residents of
the dried-fruit metropolis are taking a
great interest in the doings, and their
stall, with Isobel Green as convener,
will be stocked with samples of the famed
products of the district. Mrs. W. Agar
will have the cakes and sweets stalls and
will also sell plum puddings, either in
basins or bags ; these, with plum cakes,
will be suitable for dispatch to England.
When she officially opened the exhibi-
tion of water-colors by L. P. Curtis at the
Kozminsky Gallery Mrs. T. J. Ryan said
that as a Queenslander herself she was
thrilled to see pictures of scenes she had
visited many times, and that she could
vouch that the artist had captured the
beauty and color of the northern State
on his canvases. Mrs. Ryan also asked:
“Why is it that some of the loveliest
things in life have such unmelodious
names? There should be a more beauti-
ful term for ‘art’ than that harsh and
snappish word.”
Hostessed by Clare Cooper, president
of the New Guinea Women’s Associa-
tion, and members of her committee, the
cheerily-informal party given at Menzies
had two objectives: to say “thank you”
to all those who helped make the Bird
of Paradise Ball a success and to give
Mrs. Stanley Best, treasurer of the ball
committee, an opportunity to hand over
to Mrs. Cooper a cheque for £l2OO. Of
this amount £BOO represented proceeds
from the ball; the balance was raised
in various ways during the year by this
very energetic group of women. The
N.G.W.A. has now reached
of having £2OOO in hand by the end of
1946. All the money raised is to imple-
ment the association’s scheme of financ-
ing scholarships ; every three years one
child will receive a secondary-school edu-
cation. Mrs. Cooper thanked members
of her committee and expressed her grati-
tude to Mr. and Mrs. Philippe Perrottet
for making possible a special presentation
by members of the Australian Ballet
Society.

* After deducting outsiders’ interest,
t Subject to intangibles.
The manufacture of drugs, proprietary
medicines, cosmetics, toilet goods, etc., is
an industry that expanded considerably
during the war, and one which has few
reconversion difficulties beyond a tem-
porary shortage of materials, including
packing materials. And it has by no
means reached the limits of its expansion,
either in the home or export markets.
The demand for cosmetics and toilet
preparations is now greater than pre-
war, and, in the opinion of the trade, the
major portion of the increased market
should be permanently held. Compara-
tively small quantities of cosmetics, per-
fumes, etc., are being imported today,
whereas before the war large supplies
came from France, Britain, U.S.A. and
Germany. The production of medical
drugs remains high, manufacturers sup-
plying both separate ingredients for
chemists to use in making up prescrip-
tions, and also in production of their
own ethical proprietary lines, demand
for which has increased considerably.
War provided D.H.A. —an amalgama-
tion of half a dozen of Australia’s lead-
ing drug houses, which came together
about 16 years ago—with fresh oppor-
tunities of which an alert management
made the most. The research staff has
produced from Australian raw materials
many lines previously imported, and “ex-
ports in considerable quantity to Allied
countries were made during the war.”
Now a new subsidiary, Drexo Pty., looks
after this recently-developed side of the
business, to foster which substantial out-
lay on a factory and equipment has been
made. The programme of expansion also
includes construction of new laboratories
at Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and
Perth and of new warehouses and offices
at Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart and Adel-
aide—a site in Bourke-street, Melbourne,
was recently bought for the purpose.
Manufacture of hyoscine and atropine
has been expanded, and the co. is now one
of the world’s major suppliers of these
two lines. Production of nicotine sul-
phate, used extensively in the primary
industries, is also progressing satisfac-
torily.
To finance its programme of expansion,*
the board proposes to make a new issue
of ord. shares, the amount, terms and
conditions of which are to be announced
when Treasury approval has been re-
ceived. It might be necessary, the chair-
man says, to make the issue at a premium
which would allow a reasonable sum to
be obtained for the rights.
Paid .capital is now £2,575,244 in
100,000 6 p.c. cum. prefs. and
2,475,244 ords., supported by £798,473
of reserves, the lot subject to in-
tangibles totalling £1,045,980 —£289,725
goodwill, etc., and £756,255 excess
cost of acquiring inter-co. holdings
over their book value. For this and
other reasons many doubt the wisdom of
issuing scrip at a .premium these days.
Buyers offer 365. (ceiling price) for the
ords,, at which figure the immediate re-
turn is 3.6 p.c. on a 6\ p.c. div. basis.
The prefs. seldom appear on ’Change.
After providing for taxation, allowing
£76,012 (up £4164) for depreciation and
deducting outside interests, the board
figured net profit £6871 better at £186,350.
That covered the pref. div. and 7,2 p.c.
on ord. capital as against 7,7, 7.1, 7.1, 7.5
and 7.2 p.c. back to 1940. The div. was
kept at 6y p.c. A special victory bonus
of 1| p.c, was added in the previous term,
to meet which £37,067 has been “trans-
ferred from past profits,” and a further
£53,558, making £90,626 in all, was
taken from somewhere and put in the
window.

Contrary to general experience in the
trade, this textile manufacturer suffered
less from the effects of labor shortage
last term than during the previous one,
when portion of both spinning and knit-
ting plants was idle. Nearly 100 em-
ployees returned to the co. after dis-
charge from the services, and the four
branch mills, established with a view to
tapping labor pools outside the Mel-
bourne area, were of “great assistance.”
These branches draw raw materials from
the parent Coburg plant, but none is
directly dependent upon coal. Their
combined output was the best yet.
Although substitution of male for female
labor helped to stabilise the position, mill
staffs remained below full-strength, and
shortage of coal, especially toward the
close of accounts, threw the parent plant
into low-gear, and substitute fuel had to
be used at increased cost.
The marked improvement in earnings
resulted mainly from higher selling prices
for worsted yarns, approved by the
authorities from the beginning of 1946,
from the growth in civilian trade which
replaced less profitable defence contracts,
and from a strong but mostly unsatisfied
export demand. On the question of ex-
ports, chairman Richardson declares:
It is a matter of keen disappointment
to us that today’s conditions frustrate any
serious attempt to seize the golden oppor-
tunities offering in the export trade. Apart
from orders from U.N.R.R.A., we have
exported only small quantities of goods,
and these mainly during the period when
we were changing over to peace-time pro-
duction. We have endeavored to confine
these exports to countries where we can
reasonably hope to build up a connection
which will continue after world conditions
have become more settled.
When the present hunger for goods abates
it will be quality and price rather than
ability to supply that will hold the market.
After setting aside £30,162 (up £8805)
for depreciation, there was a leap of
£90,492 in gross earnings (£236,958). Exes.
(£169,347) took £58,391 of the gain,
mainly on account of increased provision
for taxation. The net result was £32,101
stronger at £67,611. That was enough to
pay the prefs. their 9 p.c. (=£36,000)
and show 39.2 p.c. on the £80,527 of ord.
capital, compared with nil, 35.4, 36, 55.4,
42.6, 55.8, 41,2 and 30.2 p.c. back to
1938. The div. was kept at p.c.,
£lO,OOO was sent to the staff fund, and
the £11,545 that remained lifted free
reserves to £273,983. In addition
£169,831 is specifically earmarked for de-
preciation.
When considering the apparent high
rate of earning on ord. capital, it is neces-
sary to remember that in the reconstruc-
tion just over 20 years ago £322,000-odd
of ord. capital (16s. per share) was jet-
tisoned, and for the next decade it was
a struggle -to keep up payments to the
prefs. A partial restoration of ord. capi-
tal is a future possibility.
The immediate outlook is for a full
order-book. The recent rise in the price
of raw-wool is absorbed, or partly-
absorbed, by Government subsidy, be-
cause the price of tops and yarn is fixed
by official edict. Other costs, which are
still advancing, have to be absorbed with-
in the business. Any substantial improve-
ment in earnings of the industry as a
whole is likely to be offset by a reduction
of subsidy.

lows :

This is Australia’s biggest trustee co., and
a very solid institution it is, too. The
volume of business entrusted to its ex-
pert care keeps on expanding, and can
be expected to continue to do so. War
and the maze of official complications
that followed in its wake have made
plainer than ever the advantages of the
corporate over the private trustee.
Greatest difficulty since war began has
been to prevent costs getting too
far ahead of the moderate advance
in commission and other earnings, which
are anchored by legislation. Officialdom
threw a blanket over capital values,
interest rates were forced down and rents
kept low. While rigid ceilings have been
maintained over the factors affecting
earnings, costs, especially taxation, have
not been restrained in like manner. One
result has been that the growth in exes,
has outstripped the growth in earnings,
despite expansion of the volume of busi-
ness.
For the four years to the close of
accounts in 1940 the co.’s gross earnings
expanded at the average rate of £9485 p.a.

Last term the value of trusts placed on
the books exceeded those wound up by
£1,600,708. The leap of £26,187 in gross
earnings arose mainly from “arrears of
commissions derived from sales as a re-
sult of the great demand for real estate
and from repayment of loans on mort-
gage formerly deferred in terms of the
moratorium.” Exes, took £21,389 of the
gain. After deducting £2500 sent to the
staff fund (shown as written off in the
table), but including a net addition of
£ll6l to commission reserved account
—the unearned portion of corpus com-
missions—net result from all sources was
£4BBB stronger at £26,692, or 13.3 p.c. on
capital as against 10.9 p.c. for the pre-
vious term. A special bonus of 2\ p.c.,
(not likely to be maintained) was added
to the 10 p.c. div., making 12£ p.c. for
the year.
When the books closed freehold, etc.,
figured at £115,878 (it is worth a lot
more), mortgages £121,935, debtors’ bal-
ances £2127, and Government securities
and cash £339,581. Including an unspeci-
fied provision for taxation, the amount
coming to sundry creditors was £68,289.
At £5 17s. (ceiling price) the £lO shares
paid to £2 —the other £8 includes a re-
serve liability of £5 callable only in the
event of liquidation —return 3.4 p.c. on
a 10 p.c. div. basis, or 4.2 on the basis
of last term’s distribution. Net tangible
cover is visibly £4 19s. 3d. per share.
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie
Headquarters are at London, but the
leases, which include the Iron Duke,
Oroya South, Australia East and Brown-
hill, are on the Kalgoorlie Golden Mile
(W.A.), where a 12,000-ton-a-month mill
handles the feed. For the year to end
March last 116,601 tons (up 12,248 tons)
ore were put through for 27,8080 z. (up
27570 z.) fine gold? an average of
4.77dwt. About half this throughput
came from the Australia East opencuts-
and averaged s.sdwt. The overall re-
covery was 92 p.c. Total working costs
were only Bd. higher at 31s. (stg.) per
ton, despite a substantial increase in de-
velopment expenditure.
Gold proceeds, etc., were £24,444
stronger at £232,768. Including provi-
sion for taxation (£11,500), exes.
(£200,288) took £21,922 of the gain, leav-
ing the net result £2522 better at
£32,480, or 52.8 p.c. on capital. That
leaves out of the reckoning £43,500
written back on account of over-provi-
sion for taxation in the past, £29,500
allowed for depreciation, £7500 written
off development account and £lO,OOO
earmarked to help meet the cost of test-
ing the co.’s ground at the southern end
of the Kalgoorlie field. The div. was lifted
from a nominal 5 p.c. to 8* p.c. English
income tax of 9s. in the £ (previously
10s.) reduced the 8? p.c. to 4.8 p.c. net
(=£29,585).
During the year 7378 ft. of development
work was done, of which 2253 ft. was in
ore averaging 7dwt. over an average
width of 54 inches. Best exposure was
in the footwall of the old opencut at
No. 2 level on the Iron Duke, where
stripping uncovered ore 120 inches wide,
averaging 17.5dwt. The Idaho rnine,
about a mile south of the Oroya South
leases, has been unwatered preparatory
to development. At lot of wealth was
taken from this mine in the past. Test-
ing of the co.’s extensive holding at the
southern end of the field is scheduled to
begin during the current term.
At end March proved and probable ore
reserves were put at 526,660 tons,
averaging s.ldwt., a drop of only 5260
tons and o.2dwt. compared with a year
earlier
When the books closed the co. was
holding £223,196 in Government securi-
ties and cash to meet commitments, in-
cluding the div., totalling £74,401. Paid
capital is £614,750 in 10s. stock units,
which recently fetched 9s. 9d. stg. in
London.
Zinc Investments (paid capital £250,000)
netted £11,348 (up £99) for the year to
June 30 last and paid 5 p.c. (£12,500),
same as for the two preceding years. But
“maintenance of this rate will call tor
reconsideration in the near future, the
chairman says. Assets ' consist of Gov-
ernment securities and cash £24,581, and
196,367 f.-p. pound ords. in Associated
Pulp and Paper, together with 119,250
“B” shares of 17s. Bd. each in Minerals
Separation and De Bavay’s Processes—
-36,000 are paid to 13s. 3d. each and the
balance fully paid. The paper co. dis-
tributed 6 p.c. last term, and its shares
recently sold at 375. 6d. each. No royalty
business haj> been written, or divs. paid,
by De Bavay for some years. The ques-
tion of a return of capital is still in abey-
ance, because the board is unable to get
an assurance that the paper co.’s scrip,
if distributed, would be free of tax in
shareholders’ hands. The investment co.’s
f.-p. 4s. shares fetch 6s. in the market.

For the year to end August last En-
terprise of New Guinea Gold and
Petroleum spent £791 (£416 previous
term), mainly on work preparatory to a
war-damage survey of its mine at Edie
Creek, New Guinea. Income was £5.
Most of the surface buildings, plant and
equipment have been demolished or ex-
tensively damaged, and claims amount-
ing to £9148 have been lodged with the
War Damage Insurance Commission,
which has made an advance payment of
£lOOO since the close of accounts. A
further claim is to be made in respect of
underground damage not yet assessed.
The board intends to sell the mine as
soon as a suitable offer is received and
concentrate on the search for oil when
authority to do so is obtained. When the
books closed there was £976 in cash, etc.,
to meet commitments totalling £971.
Paid capital is £81,320 in 21,122 £5 shares
paid to £3 17 s. each, thus leaving
£24,290, or 235. a share at call.

assayed 13.62 p.c. copper and 5.680 z.
silver, and 14.41 p.c. copper and 5.950 z.
silver, with a trace of gold in each. This
the owner, C. F. Bagley, calls “promis-
ing,” though he isn’t “over-optimistic,”
apparently as to the quantity of ore
of that grade available.

Official figures show that £140,352 of
Government money was expended to
June 30, 1946, to preserve the assets of
Westralian goldmining cos. affected by
war conditions. Payments included,
Triton, £51,766 ; Big Bell, £40,365 ; Gladi-

IN pre-war days Production often outpaced Supply. Then
came War . . . and an almost complete cessation of pro-
duction for every-day needs. As the War years mounted
the needs of primary producers also mounted. With Peace
therefore came a tremendous waiting: market far beyond the
powers of industry to satisfy immediately.
That is the universal story of Supply and Demand to-day.
The Konaldson-Tippett works, organised for volume produc-
tion, finds itself, as do other major industries, limited by
the supply of raw materials. But Supply is gaining pace and
i. reduction is gathering speed, thereby hastening the day
when immediate delivery” will once again be our slogan.
In the meantime, lodge your order with us. We guarantee

A "CHINESE" PLAY.
“Enduring as the Camphor Tree,” a
Chinese play written by Russell J. Oakes,
an Australian, and produced by Mel-
bourne’s Little Theatre, is apparently de-
signed to extract as much humor as pos-
sible from alien stage conventions,
Chinese stage conventions are as stiff
as buckram. An interlocutor comes on
and carefully removes any atmosphere
of suspense that may have been created
by telling the audience exactly what is
going to happen ; the actors begin with a
kind of Who’s Who about themselves be-
fore they get down to business; and the
scene-shifters come and go in full view—
a convention which arises from the simple
fact that Chinese plays are usually pro-
duced in the street with the audience all
around them, so that the expectation-
value of a curtain has never presented
itself to the Celestial playwright.
It is all extremely funny when viewed
through Western eyes, and Mr. Oakes
has succeeded brilliantly in extracting the
last ounce of humor from it. But the
form, to quote a phrase constantly occur-
ring in the play, is of no importance.
As Shakspeare said, the play’s the thing,
and there isn’t much in Mr. Oakes’s tale
of how the beautiful Pumelo elopes with
Shen Lo, the insect pedlar, who turns out
to be an artist, and how his brush is
cursed by the villainous Lord Ku so that
his portraits of lovely women all turn into
demons.
The fun of the evening comes out of
the audience having its set of theatrical
associations violated by another. Betty
Philips, Robert Stirling, Vernon George,
Frank Thring and others played the piece
in the spirit of its intention in almost
incredibly gorgeous costumes lent by the
Bendigo Chinese Association.
Bernard Heinze
If Bernard Heinze shows the same form
in Canada as he did in the farewell con-
cert, given as a gesture to him by the
Sydney Myer Free Concert trustees at
Melbourne Town Hall, he should satisfy
expectations. An excellent rendering of
the Cockaigne overture of Elgar was fol-
lowed by the Busoni concertino and the
Debussy Rhapsodic for clarinet, both 1
admirably played by that superb
clarinetist, Tom White. It was a delight
to hear his instrument weaving its way
through the delicately contrasted patterns
of the undramatic Debussy item. Rhap-
sody in A Major, with its wild Rumanian
rhythms, and the Tschaikowsky Fourth
Symphony, with its quiet initial move-
ment and its uproarious finale, filled the
second part of the programme. The
packed house was all on time, didn't
jabber and sat as quiet as medical students
at a surgical demonstration.
Henri Krips
The restored foyer chandelier didn’t
drop nor the pipes of the grand organ
curl up and crack, but conductor Henri
Krips’s collar did part from one of . its
moorings just after the first performance
in the Sydney Town Hall on Saturday
night of Debussy’s Rhapsodic for saxo-
phone and orchestra. Old concertgoers
will probably swear that the introduction
of Tin Pan Alley’s favorite instrument of
torture had something to do with the
sartorial rebellion. The work, the solo
part of which was played by Clive
Amadio, has little to recommend it be-
yond a few ingenious contrapuntal effects.
There is an almost complete absence of
harmonic beauly in this typical example
of French impressionism, and it suffered
badly by comparison with the rest of the
programme Mendelssohn’s “FingaPs
Cave” overture; Smetana’s sparkling
“Moldau,” with its graceful depiction of
the Bohemian pastoral and riverside
scene; Samuel Barber’s lyrical Adagio
for Strings and Dvorak’s Fifth Symphony.
Ballet
Philippe Perrottet appears to be the
hairspring and the mainspring of the six-
months-old Australian Ballet Society,
which concluded its season at North Syd-
ney Independent Theatre last week. Be-
sides being producer, author or co-author
and choreographer of the five ballets pre-
sented by the society, he is also by far its
best dancer. He has grace, a lithe, catlike
agility and the ability to freeze into rigid
immobility. Important as it is to the
illusions of ballet, this last quality
was lacking in the other dancers, with the
exception of Rachel Cameron, whose
graceful and accomplished dancing
needed only the acting ability shown by
Vera Windas to round it off. The
society’s final programme consisted of a
white “Etudes Romantiques,” a brief,
moody “Elegie” and a fairy-tale extrava-
ganza, “The Three Lemons.” The
“Etudes,” despite its romanticism and its
roses like twin splashes of warm, red
blood on the white simplicity of its cos-
tumes, is cold —like a dead fire—while
“Elegie,” with its deliberately crude cos-
tumes and decor, has only a dull heavi-
ness that never rises to beauty “The
Three Lemons” is more satisfying, de-
spite the nonsense of its content. Its
spectacle and length gives all the dancers
-—Perrottet, Miss Cameron and Miss
Windas, and Helen George, Anne
Palmer and Terence Murphy—an oppor-
tunity to do something substantial, and
its comparative coherence assists them in
histrionic shortcomings. John
1 alhs s music fits the piece well enough,
but one piano is neither enough to assert
it nor to balance sound with spectacle.
F.S.”; Since the Borovanskys put on
hrst Australian ballet, “Terra Aus-
tralis, at His Majesty’s, Melbourne, there
has been an outbreak of suburban choreo-
graphers bursting to express the indi-
genous in their subject-matter. The Boro-
vansky effort, to Esther Rofe’s engaging
music and Torn Rothfield’s story, was re-
vived last week and still maintains its
position, even against the competition of
a Hawthorn example in which the Carlton
and Fitzroy football teams portrayed the
true Australian spirit.
Bedroom Comedy
A light-hearted swapping of wives, a
humor which never strays far from the
bedroom, a skilful and conscious use of
cliches and the comic representation of
the pseudo-artistic temperament are the
mam ingredients of “Why Not To-
night?” presented by the Mosman
Theatre Guild at the Mosman Town
Hall. The play, which is that type of
English comedy farce with which even
Hottentots must now be familiar, is
bright and fast, and, if it is obvious from
the lifting of the curtain that all sorts of
conventional unconventionalities will
arise from Susan Ridgeway’s experiment
of inviting Helen and Maxwell Maxwell
to share the Ridgeway home, it is equally
obvious that everything will turn out for
the best in the end. Cynthia Carroll,
Tom Vary, Douglas Irving, M. L.
Thomas and John Hudson did all that
was required of them very competently.
Artbursts.
Jean Bellette
The full measure of Jean Bellette’s
work can hardly be assessed by the two
pencil drawings bought by the N. S.
Wales Gallery from the artist’s Sydney
exhibition. “Resting Girl,” despite its
relaxed and rather lifeless expression,
manages to convey softness and gentle-
ness, and “Child’s Head*’ has character,
but, though pleasant, both drawings
are essentially slight. In her larger
paintings and drawings Miss Bel-
lette seeks inspiration in the world of
Alcestis, Diomedes, Heracles and Hip-
polyte and the Infant Dionysus, with pic-
tures bearing those names, but her classi-
cal figures lack almost every classical vir-
tue ; “Diomedes” is a red and grotesque
composition, and a gladiator-like group
titled “The Fight” is stiff and unnatural.
The same classical inspiration is apparent
in the artist’s backgrounds—which, how-
ever, Jack classic purity and balance and
in no way resemble Mediterranean topo-
graphy—and in her interpretations of the
world of today. But the world depicted
—the fiery classic landscapes, and the
smeary paint and yellow house and
stricken tree of “Old House, Double
Bay”—is no real world. Nor has it the
, beauty achieved by the pre-Raphadites,
who combined painstaking detail, or
“truth to nature,” with the most airy
fancy. “Egyptian Girl” is a vivid impres-
sive portrait of a narrow-faced, dark
woman with heavy arched eyebrows,
black sleepy eyes, curved red lips and a
long neck. The painting stands out from
others in the exhibition —although one
has only to inspect G. W. Lambert’s “The
Red Shawl” in the N. S. Wales Gallery
to see vividness enhanced by grace.
R. Malcolm Warner
Mr. Warner’s exhibition of water-
colors (David Jones’s Gallery, Sydney)
shows a limited vision applied to a wide
geographical range—Moresby, Canada,
Sydney, Bahamas, Victoria and elsewhere.
There is vigor, clarity, color and the
knack of catching impressions, but, in
the more striking paintings, there is too
often a tangled, obvious use of color—as
in “Windy Weather, Nassau, Bahamas” —
and a certain straining after effect. Where
the falsely-picturesque is ignored or
touched lightly the artist does much
better, “Springtime, Warburton, Vic-
toria,” with sombre dark greens and a
contrasting light, is more satisfying. The
facility and naive drama of the bulk of
the work is compensated for to some
degree by the snow and quietly expressed
distance in the sky of “Manitoba,
Winter” ; by the fresh blossoms and the
light breaking through the dark branches
of trees in “Spring in the Peach Or-
chard” ; and by the shimmer of cold
light on buildings in “Street in Halifax.”
Beatrice Kelly
Beatrice Kelly’s paintings (Grosvenor
Galleries, Sydney) include some lively
still-lifes, flowers and books and odd
jumbles of things, all pleasantly stated.
Her flower-pieces all have the same quali-,
ties of warmth and richness of a limited
kind, but no final statement; in “Bella-
donna Lilies” she has made skilful use
of the polished surface of a table with
the flowers reflected in it. “Chinese Date
Palm,” with its irregular arrangement of
apron, shears, foliage and a blue dappled
jug, has a sprawling charm and a ripe
redness. “Black Faun,” a familiar
group, is mainly remarkable for the acci-
dental appearance of the faun. “Little
White Horses,” with a background of
placid landscape and horses like little
white toys, is a nice combination; “Hill
Top” is green and pretty.
Aboriginal Art
The aboriginal artists represented at the
exhibition at the Studio of Realist Art,
Sydney, are all members of Albert
Namatjira’s tribe, taught and encouraged,
like Namatjira, by Rex Battarbee. They
are Otto, Reuben and Edwin Pareroultja,
Hencock Raberaba, Walter Ebatarinja
and Oscar Namatjira. All of them show
strong imitative ability, but only Edwin
Pareroultja shows any real artistic per-
ception—his “Haast Bluff” is simply and
severely stated with an impressive shaded
brilliance. Albert Namatjira is also rep-
resented, and, after the dreary repetition
of his work, it is refreshing to turn to
one of his paintings and see trees and
creek in a winding pattern, a strong red
foreground and the hard blue battlements
of hills crossed by a haze that is both a
veil and. an accent.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Notwithstanding his having been the subject
of legal dickering during the week Cold Shower
was made favorite at odds-on for the seven-
furlongs Camden Handicap at Randwick on
Saturday. There was only a smallish crowd
present, but they made more than a fair-sized
row when the “good thing,” after rearing and
losing several lengths at the start, failed to
run a place in the field of seven. Cold Shower
returned to scale bleeding from scratches along
his side, and Mulley was fined for excessive
use of the spurs. Stewards then opened and
adjourned an inquiry into the running, trainer
and jockey being eventually exonerated from
all blame.
Though never at a better price than evens,
Cold Shower had drifted in the betting, strong
support comjng for the Veilmond gelding Native
Son, whose recent form had been poor. With
Briscoe in the saddle, Native Son led nearly
all the way to win by two lengths from Hiraji,
with a further two lengths to the Maharaja
Gaekwar of Baroda’s mare Lakshmi Vallis.
Since he has had several horses racing here
with moderate success it’s a wonder the
Maharaja has' not made a bigger splash at
Australian yearling sales. In England he has
paid fantastic prices for yearlings, and on one
occasion paid 4000 guineas for a single stud
service by the outstanding sire Nearco.
Associated with racing for half a century
past, Mrs. A. Whitehouse, who had owned
Cold Shower, died last week. In her will
she left the horse to her trainer, C. E. Stephen-
son, and the question arose as to the correct
nomination of Cold Shower for Saturday’s
race. It was ruled that pending settlement of
the will the horse would have to race for the
estate. Two other well-known owners have
also passed on —F. J. Smith, who raced as
“Mr. Constable” and was a part-owner of
Ajax, and Mrs. C. Hicks, who raced Katanga.
Of the seven races at Randwick three were
for two-year-olds and the results of these
should have been soothing to bookmakers re-
cently represented as bemoaning the disastrous
success of favorites in juvenile events. Being
the only winner in the field, Fellowship was
made favorite at Bernborough-like odds for the
Hoxton Park Juvenile. Previously unraced
Cherson '(G. Moore), at 25 to 1, led all the
way to just pip another outsider, Prince
Collero, while the good thing trailed in a
distant' third. A brown colt by Beau Son from
the Melfo"rt mare Victorine, Cherson earned
a first-prize cheque of £525 plus sweepstakes,
more than balancing his account: he cost 400
guineas as a yearling.
Although the Maltine Stakes for fillies was
only a five-furlongs scamper Lady Calm (G.
Pownall) won it in a fashion which suggested
that she may have some of her sire’s staying
ability. She’s by Marabou, one of the elite
who have won a Melbourne Cup and also
sired a Cup winner. Lady Calm was,, fairly
well backed, though Santa Maria and Kindly
Light, who filled the places, were preferred.
The other two-year-old race, the Kirkham
Stakes, was a neutral result for the books as
there was practically no betting. The Breeders’
Plate winner Temeraire was regarded as having
a mortgage on the prize. The other two
starters, Sovereign and Owen More, picked up
some easy place-money: they made a bit of
a race of it for the larger cut, but Sovereign
had second money Safely in his keeping at the
leger. All Cook had to do on Temeraire was
hold him back, and he still won by 10 lengths.
Temeraire looks absurdly better than any of
the other youngsters this season, but his trainer,
F. T. Cush, professes to be not overenthusiastic,
claiming that Yaralla was a much better colt.
Cush may be remembering some of the other
Felcrags, such as Moorland and Scaur Eel, who
have both fallen short of their early promise.
The 12-furlongs Encourage was run in the
usual fashion that makes such a farce of many
“distance” races, and it was right info the
barrow of the Enfield colt Le Fusil. When
it came to a sprint home after cantering an
easy 10 furlongs or so Le Fusil (J. Thomp-
son) carried far too many fusils for the oppo-
sition, beating Haxton and Prince Verity to
the judge. In the Warwick November Handi-
cap, over the same journey, Skip Bomber
(C. Findlay) downed Panefic and Codicil in
a close finish, and did the trip in a second
and a half better time than Le Fusil. Having
not won a race' for almost two years, Skip
Bomber was not greatly fancied.
Punters searching desperately for an omen
when the last race came round might have done
worse than note the fact that Chatlock, trained
and part-owned by E. Hush, carried the same
colors as Russia —and did ’em proud. Edin-
burgh and Johnny Zero were in the places.
* * * *
Though she did not win the Eclipse Stakes
at Caulfield on Saturday, Sweet Chime proved
herself in it the best of the current crop of
three-year-old fillies. None of her sex of any
age has ever won the Eclipse, and the Le
Grand Duc-Koriipako filly ran a grand race,
exceptionally game over the last furlong of
the mile and a half. It was a photo .-finish,
the verdict of the camera going to the Helles-
pont five-year-old horse Propontis by half a
head, with Spearmain a couple of lengths back.
Propontis’s win made a double for the breed,
the Hellespont-Studio colt Chanak having com-
fortably downed Denhoti and Two Kings in
the five-furlongs Stansmore Two-year-old.
Denhoti, of course, is a Dhoti, and that breed
numbers at least one winner pretty well every
meeting, Saturday’s being the filly Eba; too
good for Del Rose and the heavily-backed
Seleria in the Stansmore second division.
The five-year-old St. Magnus mare La Patrice
had little trouble accounting for Regal Coin,
Guraki and the rest of a fair-sized field of
sprinters in the Rosstown Plate. In the Tara
Steeple (2 miles 3- furlongs) Quixotic added
yet another win to the extraordinary David
list, just getting there in a photo .-finish from
the Lo Zingaro geldings Garofil and Don
Gypsy. The Law Maker-Rokell colt Bray
Law lived up to early promise in making the
big field of three-year-olds in the Mile Pelham
Handicap look rather cheap; he won by five
lengths from Skyrocks, with Glendenning an-
other couple of lengths further back. O.
Nicholls landed the apprentice-riders’ Ormond
Handicap fairly easily on the Blank gelding
William Tell, with Rose Bay once more failing
to do better than second, and old Contact
third.
* * * *
A week or two back the Scintillation-
Tarnished five-year-old mare Black Pearl was
mentioned here as an outside prospect for the
Brisbane Cup. They didn’t fly that high with
her, but at Doomben on Saturday she won
the mile Novice in 1.375, equalling Repshot’s
record for the course.

While the war was on it was stated that
racing in France would take many years to
recover from the damagq caused by the Ger-
mans removing the best bloodstock to their
own countrv. Judged by the French successes
in England this year that must have been utter
bunkum. On the other hand, the war’s effects
are most probably what are being felt in the
apparent falling-off. of English horses ; feed
shortages would now be showing up.
The laments by English sporting writers on
the decline of stamina leceived plenty of sup-
port from the result of the King George VI
Stakes, run at Ascot last month. The grey
"When you’ve finished rolling the pitch We’ll make a start."
Airborne has proved himself the best of present
English stayers, having won the Derby, the
Prince of Wales Stakes and the St. Leger, and
was at odds-on for the big two-mile test. He
was beaten into third place by the French colt
Souverain, who won the event more easily than
Russia won the Melbourne Cup. A, long way
behind him, the Irish Derby winner Bright
News just beat Airborne for second money.
The French colt’s win was all the more
pointed in the he’d been off color after crossing
the Channel, had an interrupted preparation
and went out looking a bit above himselr.
Souverain, who won the'Grand Prix de Paris
and the Prix Royal Oak, both run over 3000
metres at Longchamps, is a bay colt by
Maravedis from Jolie Reine. Souverain s win
was pointed in another way. When he beat
the French Derby winner Prince Chevalier in the
Grand Prix de Paris he got there by only a
short head, and he downed the same colt by
only three-quarters of a length in the French
St. Leger.
The “Times” writer spoke of Souverain as
“by far the best three-year-old we have seen
this year” and “a very worthy successor to
Caracalla as the champion of the two
countries.” Another of the season’s big dis-
tance events to go to a French contender was
the Cesarewitch Stakes (2i miles), won by
Monsieur, I’Amiral, a five-year-old horse by
Admiral Drake.,
One' result of the failure of British-bred
stayers against those over from France this
year has been an increasing of prizemoney
for one or two distance events, in order to
encourage breeders to concentrate more on
stamina lines than they have been doing. Thus
£3500 has been added to the Ascot Gold Cup,
making it now worth £lO,OOO. A more remark-
able result is an effect the French successes
have had in France. As a means of protecting
French breeding a rule was made back in 1833
barring foreign horses from competing m
French classics, the Grand Prix excepted. In
their new-won confidence the French racing
authorities have waived the rule, and next year
English horses will be eligible to compete in
the French Derby, Oaks, St. Leger and
Guineas.

Careful cricket: *
If cricket is losing popularity as a spectacle,
not a little of the blame belongs to cricketers
becoming a tribe of statisticians to whom the
average, not the game, is the thing.
Rain made a washout of the N.S.W. v. Eng-
land match in Sydney, causing play to be
abandoned ’*on the first day and not resumed
till 2.30 on the fourth. Continuing for N.S.W.,
Morris and Alley, both left-handers, made the
pace willing, adding 68 in 46 minutes; Morris
81, Alley 43; 4 for 165 declared.
With nothing hanging on the game and a
draw the only possible outcome the English-
men had a prize opportunity to go in and have
a lash —to please the crowd with an exhibition
of cricket at its liveliest. Hutton, who opened
with Washbrook, at times entered info the spirit
of things and ran up a fairly bright 97. Lind-
wall opened the attack and justified use of
that overworked adjective “hostile” —leastways
he clouted Hutton twice in the first over.
Having scored 13, Washbrook made an in-
decisive thrust at one of Lindwall's fliers and
was caught by Grieves. Then came Gibb, to
give a display which had the flavor, weight and
dull consistency of an underdone Yorkshire
pudding. His only bright moment was when
in the final over he scampered for an impossible
single and ran his partner out. Compton came
in for the last few balls, made a single, and
the game finished with the Englishmen 2 for 156.
Heading north, Hammond and co. tackled
Queensland’s XI, and, between the weather and
excellent form of the State team, the English-
men were soon having a torrid time. The
Queenslanders had the luck of the toss and
the luck stayed with them through some rather
shaky moments early in their first' innings.
Several chances were missed off Bedser, who’s
now bowling right up to his reputation. Given
time to settle down, the Queensland opener
Cook carried his bat throughout and con-
tributed 169 of the side’s 400. Taking their
turn at the crease, the M-C.C. men were soon
given renewed grounds for respecting the wiles
of Colin McCool, who bagged Hutton (42),
Washbrook (40) and Gibb (16) on Saturday.
On Monday the rot continued, seven being back
in the stand by lunch with the score 227,
McCool having added the wickets of Ham-
mond (8) and Yardley (14) to his bag. Edrich
made a stand (64 not out), but the innings
ended at 310; McCool 6 for 105.
Geoff Cook’s 169 not out beat D. Watt’s
157 as the highest individual store to date
against the visitors; also if rubbed out Cook’s
own Sheffield Shield best, a fine 156 at Bris-
bane in 1934, with Grimmett bowling.
* * * *
Miller (188) and Hassetf (114), and a fine
second-innings bowling effort by G. Tribe (6
for 68), did most to get Victoria’s nine-wickets
win over S.A. Bradman (119) and Hamence
(116) tried hard to save the side. Needing 79
in 35 mins., Miller (33) and Hassett (36) had
them on the board with only two mins, to
spare. Scores: S.A., 270 and 356; Vic., 548
and 79 for one wicket. Tribe’s 13 for 153 was
the best bowling turn of the season.

Katoomba Golf Club now has some-
thing it doesn’t want —its own Gold Cup
trophy, which it won back from East-
lakes. The club would rather see the
trophy going the rounds of competing
clubs. The second Gold Cup carnival
since the war resulted in overwhelming
entries from Sydney, Illawarra and
Mountain clubs, and, with an array of
trophies—given by Katoomba citizens —
that would stock a shop, the two-day
events ran smoothly until the numbers
beat the hours and late finishers were lit
to the last greens by headlights, torches,
lanterns, matches and —well, language.
But it’s safe betting there’ll be even more
entries next year.

Davis Cup chances:
There is a tendency to regard Australia’s
Davis Cup prospects with some pessimism.
Why? The Australians have the advantages
of playing on familiar courts in their native
land. The Yanks don’t know our courts,
country or climate.
As for the players, the Americans have one
certainty. Before leaving America the U.S.
manager, Pate, said that Kramer would be one
of their singles players; the rest of the team
yet to be decided. Against that, on present
form, we have two “certs” —Bromwich and
Pails. They stand out above our other players
as much as the solitary Kramer evidently does
above the other Americans. As to their relative
form, the American No. 1 Kramer and our
No. 2 Pails played at Wimbledon and failed.
In the last Davis Cup contest Kramer and the
late J. Hunt' were beaten by Bromwich-Quist.
Bromwich and Pails should be capable of
winning one singles each. Either of them might
win both his singles matches. For the doubles
the Americans have one tried, experienced
and proved pair in Talbert and Mulloy, but
they are not satisfied with that pair and are
anxious to find someone to team with Kramer.
We h£ve at least one tried pair who could
give Talbert-Mulloy a good run for their
money: Brodie and Long. Beyond this we
still have, dependent upon Quist regaining his
best form, the once indisputably best pair in
the world, Bromwich-Quist, and the place is
still open for any other doubles partner for
Bromwich. Apart from Pails, there are the
Wimbledon runner-up Geoff Brown, the first-
class youngster Sid well, Brodie and Long.
Altogether prospects don’t seem too bad.
Arriving by plane from N.Z. on Saturday
the American Davis Cup team immediately
showed one invaluable quality —keenness. Within
an hour of landing they were practising at
White City—getting the feel of our conditions
and courts and of the balls which will be
used in the Cup matches.

Charlie Ashenden had no need to ex-
tend himself in order to outpoint Jackie
Wilson at Leichhardt. Realising early
that he was in for a beating, Wilson
boxed for safety. Ashenden held off in
the tenth round, and Wilson did pretty
well during that period, but Ashenden
had things all his way in the last two
rounds.
Young Mickey Tollis, of Newcastle,
must now be accounted No. 2 lightweight.
Michael never gave Les Fuller a chance
when the pair clashed at Sydney Stadium.
A left jolt to the jaw had Fuller groggy
in the fifth round, and another down-
stairs dropped Fuller for nine seconds
in the eighth. Still another, to the chin
this time, had the unfortunate youth
down and out in the ninth.

Australia and Bretton Woods
Federal Cabinet has decided to recom-
mend to Labor Caucus that Australia
ratify its acceptance of the Bretton Woods
Financial Agreement, something already
done by the principal countries of the
world and by all the other Dominions
bar New Zealand. Both Australia and
Maoriland were among the 44 nations
which signed the agreement more than
two years ago, and the majority of coun-
tries ratified their undertaking before the
end of 1945. Soviet Russia and some
Central and South American Republics
have so far stood out.
The Bretton Woods Agreement em-
braces an International Monetary Fund
and a World Bank of Reconstruction and
Development, with an international trade
organisation implied by the agreement
and under the terms of the United States
loan to Britain.
The Monetary Fund aims to control ex-
change rates of member countries within
certain limits, to establish a central pool
of member-country currencies and gold,
and to allow member countries to buy
foreign currency from this pool (in order
to pay for imports) in exchange for their
own money. Each country is restricted
to a quota of foreign currency, subject
to concessions by the fund managers, the
idea being to keep any nation from rely-
ing on (he facilities of the fund to cover
its trade deficits year after year without
mgking a determined effort to balance
its foreign trade-in other words, an
effort to live within its export income.
But where a country appears to be im-
porting excessively it will be regarded as
a signal that other countries may not be
doing their share of buying from the rest of
the world in order to help restore balance.
If the scheme comes into full opera-
tion within the next year or two it will
have a trade situation to deal with the
reverse of the conditions which it is
proposed to correct —that is, there will be
a situation of rationed exports by most
countries rather than restricted imports.
Goods and raw materials are scarce at the
present time. Before the war the difficulty
was for one country to surmount tariff
barriers and currency restrictions in order
to market its export surplus. But short-
ages and plenitude are both problems
that proper international management can
assist in solving. It is the objective of
most countries at the present time to
restore full productivity to their in-
dustries, even though organised labor is
obstructing this in many instances.
The aim of the World Bank will be,
principally, to encourage international in-
vestment through the customary private
channels, providing the guarantees neces-
sary in the case 'of loans to backward
and devastated countries. By this means it
is hoped to expand world production and
trade, assist backward nations, and, in the
reconversion to peace-time pursuits, re-
store confidence in long-term interna-
tional lending—and in all this, inci-
dentally, helping the Monetary Fund to
operate successfully.
Australia’s quota in the fund and the
bank is $2OO million each. In the case
of the fund, every member must pay, as a
minimum, 25 p.c. of its quota or 10 p.c.
of its holding of gold and U.S. dollars,
whichever is the less, the rest in its own
currency. Initially 90 p.c. of the gold
will be held within the borders of the five
members having the largest quotas. The
currency contributions may be simply
earmarked for the purpose within the
contributing country itself.
x Only 20 p.c. of each country’s quota in
the bank may be called up for direct loan
operations, and, of this, only 2 p.c. need
be in gold or U.S. dollars. The remain-
ing 80 p.c. will be retained by member
countries as a reserve against losses on
lending, etc.
There is a section of the Australian
community, of which Minister E. J. Ward
may be said to be the mouthpiece, which
objects to participation in the Bretton
“ Cripes , the night's Work gone for nothin' — We've blewed the lot!"
Woods plans because of the limitations
placed upon a country’s discretion in
adjusting its own exchange rate in times
of financial stress and threatened or
actual industrial unemployment. Some
representatives of the export industries
are a bit Mr, Ward’s way. But if it be-
comes obvious that Australia’s economic
position has got out of balance with the
rest of the world, and only separate
action will restore equilibrium, then there
is no legal impediment to the Common-
wealth’s withdrawal from the fund and
bank upon the discharge of its obligations.
Even if all Bretton Woods plans break
down in the end, there is a responsibility
on the world at least to try for success.
The civil servant in many Government
departments created during war-time will.
if he is conscientious, be endeavoring to
work himself out of a job. That is the
rather queer situation in which a large
number of Government employees find
themselves today. Price-control officers,
for instance, should be making every
effort to encourage production so as to
make their controls unnecessary; whilst
the Treasury should be looking forward
to the day when interest rates can “stand
on their own feet,” and regulation of land
sales and share prices can be dispensed
with. It is generally recognised by those
engaged in production that arbitrary con-
trols over prices, wages, imports, ex-
ports, etc., slow down production and
commerce, and that they are only justi-
fiable as measures necessary to deal with
temporary weaknesses in the economic
system and have no value in a healthy
economy. Those in charge of these con*
ti'ols should be making every endeavor
to restore health to finance and industry
so that restrictions can be abolished and
free commerce may reign again.

During the three months to Sept. 30
Australia exported £321,000-worth of
rubber manufactures to overseas coun-
tries, nearly twice the amount sent away
during the same period of 1945, and
members of the tyre-distributing trade
allege that they mainly represent motor-
tyres being sent to New Zealand regard-
less of the scarcity prevailing in the Com-
monwealth. In spite of the removal of
rationing, tyres are still extremely diffi-
cult to get in Australia, and the question
arises as to why, in view of the fact that
there will be no long-term market in the
Dominion (three post-war factories being
now'in the course of construction), so
many tyres are being allowed to leave the
Australian market. If Maoriland is in
more dire need than the Commonwealth
the question may be satisfactorily an-
swered ; but the comradeship of Labor-
party politics may have more to do with
the business than other considerations.
The Canberra Labor Government has
never fully explained its dealings with'
New Zealand in either wheat or textiles.
N.Z. has an election on today.
*•* * *
The next Commonwealth loan offered
will carry £3 2s. 6d. per cent, on long-
term securities (against £3 ss. per cent,
since 1940). The short-term issue will
continue to carry £2 per cent. The short-
term interest rate has been progressively
reduced from £2 15s. per cent, during the
period in which the long-term loans
carried £3 ss. per cent. Latest reduction
is in keeping with interest rates fixed by
the Government outside the bond market,
and is in step with Dr. Dalton’s contro-
versial cheap-money policy in Britain.
Whilst cheap money reduces the burden
of interest carried by taxpayers it tends
to encourage Government spending of
loan money, especially when, as is the
case now, the loans, can be forced on to
savings banks, life offices and the like
when the investment market as a whole
regards the interest rate as too low.
Forced borrowing at abnormally low
rates of interest creates future conversion
problems, as well as bringing present
problems to life offices depending largely
on Consols-for their investment income.

Housewives who find it harder and
harder* to get laundry soap can blame
principally the coalminers and the Corns,
who dragged the Queensland meatworkers
out on strike earlier this year. Soda ash
and caustic soda are products of the
South Australian alkali industry, which,
deprived of adequate coal supplies, is un-
able to provide sufficient soda ash or
caustic to keep the soap industry fully
operative. Tallow is also scarce. Bottle-
production has fallen off because of lack
of soda ash ; there have been warnings
about an imminent shortage of bottles for
beer and foodstuffs. There is no hope of
augmenting alkali stocks with overseas
supplies. Both Britain and U.S.A. are
short of soda ash and caustic.

Wages, Costs and Prices
Mr. Chifley has promised the A.C.T.U.
some modification of the wage-pegging
regulations before Christmas. In his
Budget speech, too, he made remarks
which have a bearing on the matter, his
references being to costs, prices and pro-
duction. Touching on the high factory
employment in August this year—77o,ooo
persons, compared with 540,000 in June,
1939 —he said:
Clearly we are developing a potential in
secondary production capable not only of
meeting a much wider home demand but
of supplying markets abroad. But this,
like other possibilities of the kind, is
entirely dependent upon our achieving a
higher all-round standard of efficiency and
productivity. Failure in this direction
would involve painful readjustments once
the present scarcity demand had been
satisfied.
The possibility of “failure” referred to
may be taken to mean failure to reduce
production costs, and the “gainful read-
justments” to difficulty of adjusting high
costs (including wages) to low prices
when lower prices follow production at
competitive capacity both at home and
abroad. The importance of this statement
is that it is an acknowledgment of certain
industrial realities not previously admitted
by the leader of the Australian Labor
party, though N.Z. Labor has been de-
bating the matter for some months.
The P.M. went on to say:
We have meanwhile held firmly to con-
trols not only on prices but on the main
elements in costs. It is recognised, of
course, that® with competition for resources
extremely active and rising world prices,
some changes in local price and cost re-
lationships have to be made; But these
readjustments must be handled with the
greatest care and with full appreciation of
their consequences, direct and indirect.
These remarks seem to point to contem-
plation of both increased wages and prices
as the accumulated forces of war-time
spending-power make their effect felt in
a post-war economy. It has been obvious
for some lime that the cost-of-living index
is not a true reflection of the inflation in
living costs during the war, that the price
of many imported products has risen
particularly steeply, and that for our
economy to be in harmony with itself a
higher basic wage and a higher price
level will be forced on the country during
the next few years. It is to be hoped that
the Movement —little more than an ack-
nowledgment of credit inflation en-
courages production, because, at the
present time, wages as a whole are too
high in relation to the output of goods
and services. And price subsidies are
costing taxpayers about £22 million this
year.
Apparently with the concurrence of
Treasury officials and the central bank,
Mr. Chifley indicates a gradual change
in the level of wages and prices:
We shall be wise, I believe, to pursue
a steady course, taking advantage of favor-
able conditions as they occur, striving for
greater output in all industries, making
sectional adjustments where necessary to
correct anomalies and secure a fair dis-
tribution of returns, but keeping to a
minimum any general movement in prices.
It is a pity that, as an accompaniment
to his expressed economic policy, the
Prime Minister is unable to show the
nation anything so rational or fitting in
his record of dealings in the field of in-
dustrial politics.
The rise in the price of wool since the
beginning of the season has threatened to
pierce the Government’s prices ceiling so
far as clothing is concerned, and, as a
result, taxpayers will be called on for an
additional £1,500,000 in 1946-47. to sub-
sidise woollen manufactures for home
consumption. Some overseas buyers of
wool at auction have expressed resent-
ment at this subsidy arrangement, since it
enables the local millman to bid up al-
most regardless of cost for the staple he
particularly wants. Certainly the effect
should be to stiffen prices for finer wools
—record figures have been paid lately for
selected lots. The woollen subsidy, to-
gether with subsidies in respect of tea,
potatoes, milk, imported clothing and
other items, will cost an estimated amount
of £15.8 million this year, compared with
£l3 million last year. Primary producers
will get smaller price subsidies in 1946-47
-*-£7.3 million against £19.7 million —
largely because export prices for butter
and wheat make up the losses on the
home market. There is a big reduction
in assistance to stock-feeders also.
• • * •
In his Budget speech the Prime Minister
pointed to the large accumulation of Aus-
tralian funds in London —now about
£220 million—but mentioned that rise
was only partly due to favorable export
returns, some of it being the result of the
relatively slow movement of imports,
wanted acutely in this country. Sub-
stantial liabilities have still be met arising
out of the war, and they may be paid
during the current year. Australia, too,
has yet to decide how it will treat the
British approach for a scaling-down of
sterling balances, the approach being
obligatory under the terms of the dollar
loan to Britain. Export prices for wool
and wheat are at present high, and meat
and dairy products are being bought by
Britain at greatly increased prices. * An
official warning is given, however, that
war-time scarcity in consumer countries
can be expected to stimulate production
in exporting countries, with possibly a
price reaction. While Australia is advised
to increase overseas earnings by exports
of all kinds, excessive costs in industry
must be avoided in order to guard against
an adverse turn in export prices. The
future availability of our overseas funds,
taken together with our export earnings
from time to time, will determine our
capacity to buy imports, “of which,”
says Mr. Chifley, “we need consider-
ably more than pre-war quantities to
refit our industries, restore stocks and
provide plant for new enterprises
now starting, and for which we shall
have to pay substantially higher prices
than before the war.” This official view
is generally in keeping with opinion ex-
pressed in these pages over the past 12
months, and does not suggest that a re-
duction in the exchange rate on London
is likely unless London itself takes the
initiative.
♦ * * *
There is a school of Left-wing
“thought” which regards the practice of
balancing Budgets as “crucifixion of the
workers,” there having been emphasis on
the necessity for budgetary balance in
the days of the Premiers’ Plan. In periods
of buoyant revenue, such as now, a bal-
anced Budget is imperative as soon as
post-war transition has been achieved.
International trouble-makers have other
ideas; hence their simulated scorn of
“orthodox finance” and balanced
Budgets,


ABORIGINALITIES
“Bondi Beachcomber”; Camped at
Wyganie, in the Milne Bay area, we re-
ceived frequent visits from two boong
children of a neighboring village. They
were brothers aged six and four, and won
the hearts of Diggers with their happy
dispositions and tremendous enthusiasm
for the “Aussie man” as compared to the
“Merica man’.” Army biscuits and
“bullamakau” were their weakness ; they
invariably left our camp laden with white
man “kai kai” and loud in their declara-
tion that “Aussie man, ’e numba one,”
and “Merica man, ’e numba ten.” I suf-
fered a tyre puncture outside a Yank
camp one day, and the inmates, with
characteristic hospitality, invited me to
lunch. You’ve guessed it —leaving the tent
lines were our two piccaninnies laden
with Yank chocolate and fancy biscuits,
assuring the world at large that “Merica
man, ’e numba one; Aussie man, ’e
numba ten.”

“Golly’s Missus”; The worst enemy
of the turtle (B. 30/10/’46) is the dingo,
which will systematically dig up the
whole neatly-camouflaged area of about
two or three square yards until he finds
the eggs. From close observation of
tracks, I find that only one dingo works
on each nest as a general rule, and he
devours the whole of a finding in one
meal, leaving only the tough, leathery
skins to mark his visit. I would say that
not more than one turtle out of each
hatching, in this N.Q. coastal region any-
way, ever reaches maturity.
* * * *
“Hanko”; Sales had slumped, and we
were merely rummaging when Rambat
Singh produced the cornet. “The very
good musical,” he droned. “Playing
sweetly and very nice for the three
pound.” Snowflake, who just beat Little
Joe in the grab for possession, backed
away with the instrument; wrapped his
lips round the mouthpiece and evoked a
sound like a deflating bike-tube. “Arr,
it’s broke,” he snorted, and thrust the
thing at Little Joe. The little bloke care-
fully wiped the mouthpiece with a dirty
hanky, but all he accomplished on the
cornet was a wheezy rush of air. En-
raged, he hurled it into the van, narrowly
missing Ram bat’s head. The Indian was
distressed. “The very good musical,” he
wailed, “Playing sweetly for the two
quid and the ten bob.” Bailey got it for
35 bob and straightway let us have
“Swannee River” with the aplomb and
address of a professional busker. , But
Snowflake and Little Joe were; not im-
pressed. They were playing snakes and
ladders with an outfit that cost one and
ninepence.

“D.T.”; That illustration of the two
trained woodpeckers, bringing down a
tree while their boss took it easy (B.
13/11 / ’46) was a good grin-raiser, but I
noted with astonishment that both birds
had their tails up—and that is something
that never, in fact, happens. The wood-
pecker, in the strange company of the
kangaroo, uses its strong tail as a lever.
With its both feet and the tail forming a
tripod, the fowl enjoys steady support in
its destructive job.
* ♦ * :£
“Niloc”; Barracoota hunt in packs,
and to be caught need to be coaxed up
from the deep. For this, the professionals
“Don’t worry, Ma—I'll make the train all right!”
use lines baited with cowhide and
weighted every foot or so with- lead to
keep the lure low. The fish soon become
very attached, and are hauled in, to trail
about 30 yards behind the boat. Their
cobbers, seeing that something is doing
in the fodder line, follow up, and from
then on it’s just a matter of tossing out as
many lines as the crew can handle, drag-
ging the cootas in, knocking them off
the unbarbed hooks on a rail around the
fish box, and dropping the line astern
again. The launch goes slowly round in
wide circles till the pack, becoming sus-
picious over so many suddenly missing,
submerges again. From the amateur
angler’s point of view, the barracoota is
almost the perfect fish, especially as their
overall length is about that of the average
fisherman’s outstretched hands, thus en-
suring a wealth of descriptive material.
* * * *
“Flathead”; Lofty, arriving at the fish-
ing resort, had with a couple of judici-
ously-placed beers learned the location of
the fish ; also that any time he felt like
having a go at them he’d be right for a
boat. After riding the swell for 20
minutes, he started to turn green. One of
the veterans begged him “not to lie down
in the bottom o’ the boat when we start
cleanin’ them eels. Me mate’s a bit
short-sighted and he’ll have y’ skinned
and gutted in two ups.”
* * * *
“Loe”: Can anyone explain what
causes the regular corrugations on out-
back gravel roads? One school says the
cause is the regular bumping set up by
heavy vehicles, and a look round old
Army camps would support this. My bet
would be a combination between the
under-surface structure of the road and
erosion by wind, rain and perambulating
carpet-snakes.
*' * * *
“Biro”: Mention of Eyre’s ill-fated
journey across the Nullabor Plain (B.
6/11/ ’46) recalls an old controversy. It
was to the blackboy Wylie’s bushlore,
understanding of abo psychology, unself-
ishness and resourcefulness that Eyre un-
doubtedly owed his life after Baxter had
been speared. But the charge against
Wylie is plainly that of being a Quisling
who rendered active assistance to the in-
vading enemy. The story of Eyre’s ex-
pedition party parallels that of Kennedy,
who was aided by his faithful blackboy,
Jacky-Jacky, when trying to find a way
from Rockingham Bay to Cape York.
Kennedy, like Baxter, was speared:
Jacky escaped and brought the news,
along with Kennedy’s books and papers,
a* ship that was sent to meet them.
According to our own standards of
oyalty both Wylie and Jacky were
worthy of nothing better than a traitor’s
death instead of being regarded as
models ot unselfish loyalty.
f
™ 2 ld ' timer ” : We were in George
Medley s pub in Euston when the old
cove with the heavy swag and the far-
away look dropped the former on the
verandah and brought the latter into the
oa.r. Invited to irrigate, he gazed unsee-
mgly at the wall, murmured “Ercildoune,
twenty-five an’ six, Alma Elwood,” then
reached out a sun-browned hand for his
beer. We were used to queer characters,
and paid little attention to his incanta-
tion until he’d repeated it several times.
We put a few leading questions, but all
we could find was that the old cove was
1 111 own south t’ see me daughter..
Might settle down there. She reckons I’m
gettin too old t’ be knockin’ round.”
That night, having benefited from our
largesse, he was tucked away in his
blankets in the harness-room, muttering
Ercildou’, twerry-fi’ an’ shix, ’lma
Iwood, goo’ night.” Our theories ranged
from the price of Ercildoune wethers in
the wool to imaginary pictures of his
Alma, and general opinion favored the
notion that probably Alma had married
the boss of Ercildoune and left the poor
old cove with an unhinged mind. Our
own boss solved the mystery next day
when, himself going down the river by
car, he offered the old cove a lift. “That’ll
do me,” was the grateful answer. “Y’
see. I’m goin’ down t’ see me daughter.
Ercildoune, twenty-five and six, Alma El-
wood.” “Whatinell does that mean?”
demanded the boss. He got the gentle
smile of the simple bushman. “Aw, that’s
where she lives, y’ see: Ercildoune, 256
Alma-street, Elwood, Only I can’t write,
y’ see, an’ that’s how I keep it in me
mind. Have y’ got a match. Boss?”

“Hanko”: When Bessie didn’t parade
with the milkers the boss gloomed a bit,
but it was too late to do anything about
it that night. The following morning,
the sight of crows dropping over the
sugar-gum plantation set me to investi-
gate. Bess had her head wedged between
two slender, springy saplings, so I placed
my boot on her forehead and pushed
her clear. The cow could have freed
herself with the slightest backward pull,
but her one-track mind told her she was
in a dinkum bail, and therein she would
have died,' The wagga-waggas lamented
dolefully as I wiped beef off their menu.

“Frank Mauri”: The producers of
“The Overlanders” will assure “Moya”
(B. 6/11/ ’46) that the question of dogs
in the film was raised and considered.
The answer is that heelers are not used
in the north; the cattle are far too wild.
Dogs are comparatively rare on the home
runs even. Ever see one in an American
western?

“Chuck”: Hopper had been on good
wages for years, and it surprised his
friends that he had made no. attempt to
buy a home for himself, seeing that in
other matters he always planned care-
fully. “Use y’r head, man ; use y’r head,”
was his favorite advice. So one day
Barney put a challenging “What about
y’rself? Y’ bin workin’ f’r Cockie
Hodge f’r years now an’ gettin’
a good screw an’ yet y’re still
payin’ rent. Why don’t y’ buy that
cottage orf him?” A knowing grin
crept over Hopper’s dial. “Bloke
would be a mug,” he replied. “Use y’r
head. man. Cockie can’t nut me an’ the
fam’bly out, can he?” He leaned over
confidentially. “’Course he can’t! So,
at that rate I’m pretty sure of a home.
An’ with all the Army blokes that’ll be
lookin’ f’r jobs, cripes, y’ never know,
things might start t’ git tough.” “Yair.
but”... Barney looked puzzled.
“Don’tcha tumble?” grinned Hopper.
“Cockie can’t afford t’ let that place I’m
in f’r nuthin’, an’ he can’t sack me,
neither, or he wouldn’t get no rent, see?”

“Wippegong”: Beats me how a yellow
robin can pick up eight or ten white ants
in his beak without dropping one. A
beak, hard and unbending, is ideal for
grabbing a single object, but as for
gathering with it —well, you try to get a
dozen nails between the jaws of the
pliers, one at a time. And he never misses
or hesitates, just goes ahead and gathers
them almost as fast as a hen picks up
grain, till, wearing shaggy termite
whiskers up to 1 * the eyes, he heads for the
nest. Still puzzled, I approached Mum
when she had a mouthful of clothes-
pegs and asked if she had put them there
by hand or had pecked them up one at a
time; but the inquiry was not received
in the spirit in which it was made.

“Dronestung”; We decided to rob a
bee-hive in a gnarled old box-tree. Dis-
daining a couple of hours’ toil with the
axes, Charlie suggested that I climb up
and saw off the spout the insects were
in while he reckoned on easing the limb
down with a length of clothesline. So
I shinned up to the fork and, squatting
with a leg-scissors on another projec-
tion, got to work. The limb teetered and
Charlie set himself to take the strain;
then the timber gave way with a rending
crack, dropped with a jerk and hauled
Charlie halfway up the tree. In this
position, his hat and veil knocked off,
he became a swinging target for angry
bees till I was able to slide down, tame
the honey-gatherers and rescue him. It
was when he was trudging home, with
one eye in total eclipse and the other
half-shut, that Charlie started to whinge
about the puerility of my brainwaves.

“Betcha”: If a sheepdog barks during
a competitive trial, he is disqualified; yet I
think most sheepmen will agree that a dog
that won’t speak up isn’t worth his tucker.
One I’ve got at present is a good worker,
but won’t use his voice. Round the ewes
he’ll go in fine style, but instead of run-
ning away those old crossbreds usually
come to meet him. In place of a few
barks that would turn them hastily in the
right direction he creeps in and works
valiantly, or lifts an ear to me for instruc-
tion. He gets plenty. In the yards it is
the same. All my efforts to make him
force merely result in his trotting madly
to and fro behind the tailers, or resting
his paws oh the rear jumbucks in a de-
termined and equally vain endeavor to
push them into the race. For months
I’ve persevered with the animal because
of his style, working him with a barker,,
and trying out every old trick with a slice
of virtue that would knock spots off
Job’s record. Now, show winner or not,
tomorrow that dumb cuss goes into the
rabbit pack.

“Zake”: Knew one bushman who had
his own method of cutting glass without
the aid of an expensive diamond. Driv-
ing in a nail on each side of the pane,
they being in the line of the desired cut,
he soaked a thin piece of woollen yarn
in brandy, squeezed it out, tied it to the
nails so that the yarn stretched taut along
the glass and applied a match. The yarn
burned fiercely for some seconds; then
as soon as it broke he whipped up the
glass and plunged it into a tub of water
he had handy. The glass snapped
cleanly along the desired line.
* * * »
“Exmed”: But surely those worms
that “Surcingle” uncovered when dissect-
ing that euro (B'. 23/10/’46) weren’t
tapeworms. My experience with “tapes”
is that they inhabit the intestines and no
other part. And it would be a poor speci-
men that measured only five inches —
from fowls I have drawn out specimens
two feet long, while the tapeworm that
favors a human as its host might easily
measure ten feet. Actually, there are,
three kinds of parasite worms; tape-,
roundworms and threadworms. It
would be the round variety that “S.” en-
countered. These have a peculiar trick
of exploring the body that serves as
host ; so we have seemingly incredible
stories of big worms crawling out of
children’s mouths, noses, even out of
their ears. Fortunately this is not com-
mon in our continent of generally well-
cared-for children; though even here al-
most any doctor could quote instances.
With' regard to the tapeworm, even
though iti long body may be detached
and destroyed by appropriate drugs, so
long as the head remains attached to
the coat of the intestine it will speedily
grow again.
MACARTHUR’S TIME.
Macarthur’s time! In Sydney Cove, at anchor
•ride the two
Fair prizes which the Harrington has captured
from Peru.
Her bearded seamen, seeking change from salt
adventure, find
In haunts around the waterside the pleasures
of their kind.
i
Along the winding thoroughfare—which folk as
George-street know —
With loading for Macarthur’s farm yoked oxen,
straining low,
O’ercome the heights of Brickfield Hill, thence,
urged by curse and goad,
In clouds of dust they slowly pass down
Parramatta-road.
The bondsman walks in sober grey; his masters
march in red;
The ladies wear wide crinolines; top-hatted
gents are led
By anxious seconds to a sward —Hyde Park ’tis
called today—
Where flintlock pistols leading parts in social
dramas play.
In taverns lit by tallow dips the meaner sort
persist
In solving their rude arguments with vulgar
boot and fist.
In airing views by dingy hearths their women-
folk bestow
No blessings on the rigid rule of Hunter and
Foyeaux.
The sawpits by the harborside from convict toil
afford
To busy shipwrights plank and beam; to
builders, weatherboard.
In dense Shoalhaven jungles still the doomed
red cedars grow
And pines on Richmond River yet no ruthless
axemen know.
Stout horsemen, armed and wary, ride in winter
mornings cool,
Top-coated on a forest track that leads to
Liverpool/
On Richmond Road fall hoof and wheel;
the new Cowpasture track
From Prospect takes the shepherds to
their smoky huts outback.
From Bossley Park I used to roam those
pleasant roads that wind
Historic miles in Cumberland; and often
in my mind
The landmarks of that old regime, the
days of Bond and Free,
Would bring from out a pictured past
their messages to me.
Much nearer seemed the era then of black-rap
rum and clays,
Long-barrelled muskets, beaver hats, and gigs
and bullock drays.
In one grey house upon a hill with loop-holed
outer wall
I read in letters fading fast the epitaph of all.
The shingles slipping from its roof turned
back the rain no more;
White plaster falling from the laths bestrewed
a naked floor;
Yet here, methought, a master met his guests
with gracious word,
And here a mistress may have played the
tuneful harpsichord.
And hither courting lovers rode with youthful
hearts in thrall
To some fair daughter of the house, some
maiden worth it all.
And yonder in the village church the bells
would toll or chime
When someone died or someone wed—in John
Macarthur’s time.
VICTORIA.

“Bo”: That Hungry Harrigan didn’t
exactly earn the prefix by which he had
been known in the district for years
through the abandon with which he slung
his cash around was confirmed the time
his ancient utility backfired one cold
morning when he was winding it up and
he dislocated his thumb. He hobbled up
to the dilapidated three-roomed bachelor
homestead which he shared with Fred,
his hired hand. The hobbling had noth-
ing to do with his thumb, of course. A
week before Hungry had dropped a
heavy hoe-head on a big toe, which had
gone black and was so swollen he had
to cut a corner put of an old boot be-
fore he could get it on. Fred had opined
that the toe was broken, and had advised
him to see the doctor, but his boss,
affrighted at the cost, said he’d first wait
and see “how it got on.” Fred was up
at the house cooking the dinner when
Hungry, with much groaning, threw him-
self down on the settee and called for
some hot water to bathe his thumb. Fred
examined it and said “Hot water’s no
good—it wants settin’. Y’ll have to get
the quack, an’ he can fix up y’r toe at
the same time —it’s gittin’ worse.”
hungry looked at his employee sourly.
“I’ll wait,” he growled. “I usually git a
touch o’ bronchitis at this time o’ the
year. When it comes on he can fix the
’ole lot up together!”
“How do you reckon this'd go in the parlor, Lil ?”
“Metax”: I found Hairy Albert, our
burly district rabbiter, perched on the
bunk in his hut surrounded by his gal-
lery of skins and carcasses and approv-
ingly contemplated by his following of
canine assistants as he carefully clipped
his toenails with a pair of curved-bladed
scissors which would have been an
adornment to any boudoir. “I’m goin’
to the races tomorrer,” he explained,
“and I never feel prop’ly dressed in com-
pany unless me toenails are decently
manicured. Me mother schooled me to
it. She used to say ‘Albert, dear, look
after y’r toenails and the rest of y’r
dress’ll look after itself.’ ”

“E. & 0.E.”: The fame of the Aboliar
spreadeth in far places. Reading a book
by Henry Williamson, author of Tarka
the Otter and other stories about animals,
I was interested to find a reputed belief
among Australian “cockies,” quoted on
the authority of a friend who had been
in this country. The black shags, so our
agriculturists believe, do not fly laterally
when they want to travel to another
country. Instead, they go up vertically
until they are beyond the range of the
earth’s gravitation, where they stay until
the earth has come round to the place
they wish to visit. Then they swoop
down to it. Any cow-cocky along our
littoral who sees a cormorant going
straight up should report his find to either
Ripley or the Band of Hope Union.
“Gennox”: Watching the cats of the
neighborhood being chivvied daily by
nesting wagtails I have decided that
city-bred felines, like city-bred Homo
sapiens, tend to degenerate in both the
defensive and offensive arts, I recall a
cat of my boyhood that not only fed
herself but provided many a tasty bit of
“snipe” for us, her owners. No wagtail
would have dared to hover in mid-air
threatening to pick her back, for she had
a lightning paw; a swift flick upwards
and she would pull down a bird in full
flight. Her game daily was to lie hidden
between the rows of vegetables and when
swifts and other darting birds came flying
low to pluck them down with one swift
paw flick. Her success average was at
least 90 p.c. The boss even had her
trained to catch and deliver.

“Naturala”: If “Shamuseen” (B.
23/10/’46) has a moth in S.Q. capable of
biting tunnels two inches deep into a tree
trunk he certainly should make every
detail of the insect known to eager natu-
ralists. Most moths have no biting equip-
ment whatever; most, including many
butterflies, do not even feed, the few
exceptions contenting themselves with a
sip of nectar from some honey-bearing
flower. That is why it’s so hard to com-
bat a pest like the white butterfly. Who
hasn’t noted that the silkworm moth
abstains from food, merely lays its eggs
and then dies? The grubs of “S.’s” moth,
however, would have no trouble in biting
their way out through a plug of chewed
wood, however solidly cemented, for all
larvae possess an effective biting imple-
ment ; many have jaws of chiton almost
as sharp and as hard as a carpenter’s
plane. That moth that he speaks of as
walling itself in with slithers of wood is
the larva of the case moth, found prac-
tically all over Australia.

“Wippegong”: In a land so rich in
bird songs it’s idle to argue over which
is best, but easy to recall the setting by
which a particular one is remembered.
In the summer of ’32 a few wisps of
smoke rose over remote Gippsland
gullies, and all along the timber belt men
wondered which would come first, wind
or rain. The nor’-wester won, and
within 20 minutes of the fire leaping Mt.
Taronga the nearest homestead, 10 miles
down wind, was a mass of crumpled red
iron, and the stark orchard bore only
roasted apples. Then the black silence
settled. No footfall sounded in the soft
ashes; no leaf rustled —there were no
leaves ; but away up the gully the water-
fall whose song had once been heard
only in the still hours before dawn now
laughed harshly throughout the day. The
weeks passed; fitful breezes spread the
drab grey of powdered ash evenly over
stump and stone and the lone man hold-
ing on ; then it rained. The sound of rain
alone was a stimulant; the change from
dry grey to damp black, the different feel
underfoot, a tonic. Only days to wait
now and there would be little green blades
of grass, little green shoots on the gums ;
then early one crisp morning came the
song. Soft and clear, rising and falling,
pausing, then calling again, a single
scarlet robin sang from a charred stump ;
“Look, Mum, there's Dad!”
and the man, listening, knew how Noah
felt when the dove came home with a bit
of mud-stained olive.
♦ * * *
“Yair”: Scientists have discovered
that the gas that puts the kick into soda-
fountain drinks —carbon dioxide —acts as
an anaesthetic for insects subjected to
delicate surgical adventures. Sufferers
from the nocturnal incursions of the mos-
quito who have relied upon “spirals” and
other equally complicated methods of
anaesthesia will no doubt rejoice at
this easier modus operandi. Myself, I
stick to the old swat.
* * * *
“Blime”; For an hour or two Dip
cursed the crosscut, the logs, the steep
side they were on, the wind and the sway
of the saw. Then he took time off to
work it out. A bit later I noticed him
coming back with a length of old rubber
tubing, and watched him tie one end to
the big saw and the other to a sapling.
“That oughter stop the flamin’ sway,” he
growled as he started once more. First
the rubber was too tight, then it was too
loose; but after half an hour of trial
Dip had another brainwave. “Gripes, a
stronger bit o’ rubber, that’s what she
wants,” he chortled; “then all I got t’
do’s let go my end an’ the stretch’ll pull
her back.” He was still experimenting
when I knocked off. Three hours later,
my feet comfortably on the table, the hut
door opened and Dip arrived, excitement
decorating his face. “Y’ know that
sawin’ job o’ Buckley’s?” he whispered
confidentially. “I’m takin’ it, contract.”
“Six months’ hard yacker,” I warned him.
“Yair?” He stopped to give his eager
mirth its head; then “Not with me noo
patent,” he chuckled. “I’ll tell y’. I’ve
sent down f’r some real strong rubber,
see? Two bits. An’ a coupla iron pegs
t’ tether ’em tight behind each end o’
the saw. Then, cripes, all I got t’ do
is walk round and set ’er goin’ I ”
* * * *
“Gumsucker”: I’d love to see that
galloping herd of milkers (B. 23/10/’46),
which their owner regarded so com-
placently. One of my boyhood jobs was
that of cowherd, and I well remember the
threat of a hiding that would be mine
should I dare to drive the milkers at
anything above a leisurely walk when
bringing them home to the bails. Quite
correctly, my old Irish boss reckoned
that hurrying them caused them to hold
back their milk. Further he reckoned
that even such milk as was delivered
would be overheated and liable to turn
sour more quickly, than “cool” milk. And
the knowledge gathered through the
intervening years tells me today that he
was right.
* * * *
“Herbert Dawson”; Gully-raking on
Bullock Flat, near Sofala (N.S.W.), and
reinforcing the frailties of the “poverty-
pot” with the proceeds of rabbit and
fox pelts, I acquired Bluey. An upstand-
ing, well-bred staghound. Blue was like
unleashed lightning when pursuing any-
thing that “took his eye,” as it were. But
he had to see it squarely. He distrusted
such other senses as he possessed, and
anything he could see through or around
he just assumed wasn’t there—not a
comfortable assumption for himself
when the thing was a tightly-strained
wire fence. I have often seen him, after
immersion in an ice-cold digger’s hole
(we used to sling him in to wake him up
when he was too lazy to cock an ear in
a paddock full of rabbits), shake the
water from his shaggy hide and eagerly
scan the distant horizon. Should a rab-
bit move on a hillside half a mile away
he would take after it like a demented
meteor—jumping over or knocking out
of his way any other rabbits overtaken
or met. When the rabbit tried to
pace it with Bluey up the straight there
would be a pelt for the stretching wire
and a carcass for the pot. This engag-
ing animal, though provided with a ken-
nel, clean and warm, insisted on camping
out in rain, frost or snow. Though
well fed with my other dogs, he liked to
slip his collar (in the absence of material,
between his ears not a difficult job) and,
hieing in the night to distant gullies
where rabbit-poisoners were operating,
return in the small hours with a bellyful
of strychnine-seasoned rabbit entrails
and whatnots. Thus fortified, he would
entertain my delighted puppies with a
series of well-executed catherine-wheels,
interspersed with violent vomiting, the
while I rushed about with a shovel bury-
ing his lavish rejections. These doings,
despite hasty doctoring, cost me two
good pups —but not Bluey.

“Mat’s Mate”: This is an accurate re-
port of all that passed between Mat and
a Gippsland farmer who wanted 100 acres
cleared on contract. Mat: “This Mc-
Ayrshire’s place?” “Yair.” “He the
bloke that wants some clearin’ done?”
“Yair.” “About 100 acres, ain’t it?”
“Yair.” “Contract?” “Yair.” “I’m told
he’s payin’ four quid an acre?” “Yair.”
“Is McAyrshire about?” “Yair.” Silence.
Mat looked at me and I looked at him.
The other went on greasing a scarifier.
Mat, beginning to comprehend: “Hey,
are you Mr. McAyrshire?” “Yair.”
Mat: “Well, do we get the job?” Mc-
Ayrshire turned, looked us over carefully,
squinted up at the silent Gippsland hills,
and answered “Yair.”

“B. A. Ker”: Old Tibby certainly
knew a thing or two about horses and
their ailments, but nobody liked to ask
him to confirm or deny the rumor that
he had been a vet. till doping of a race-
horse caused him to be deregistered.
However, the night before the local
gymkhana Spinner Dunn approached
him with*a proposition. Tibby listened
patiently, then informed the sure-thing
gambler: “I don’t dope horses. Anyway,
I don’t know of any dope that can make
a horse win if he’s not good enough, and
I don’t think anybody else does.” But
Spinner was persistent; coaxed, argued,
then began to talk money. Persistence won.
The trotting spiders were coming out on
the track when a committeeman chanced
to walk behind the horse stalls. “What
are you giving that horse?” he demanded
of Spinner. The chestnut’s owner was a
practised liar. “Just a drop of cough
mixture,” he replied glibly. The official
wasn’t convinced; he knew Spinner.
“Well, if that’s all it is you wouldn’t
'mind taking a swig of it yourself, would
you?” he submitted; “or will I get a
vet.?” For a moment Spinner looked
at the horse, the boy in the driver’s seat
and the stern-faced authority: then he
made a brave decision. The gulp he took
satisfied the committeeman, who hurried
away to watch the race. Spinner hurried
away also, but his race ended when he
collapsed on the doctor’s doorstep. The
chestnut won fairly comfortably, but
Spinner swears he will never dope a horse
again, now that he knows what it feels
like. Tibby and the doctor exchanged
solemn winks when they met next day—
they both knew that auto-suggestion can
be more potent than cabbage-water.
“THE ORPHAN.”
Out on the bounds of Cranga, a fenceless
world and wild, ,
One day two stockmen wandered where peaics
and ridges piled, .
And on a lonely mountain-side where loud me
west wind whines
They found a black foal nuzzling a dead mare
’neath the pines.
Weird was the world to the “orphan,” the
horsemen- tall and strange;
Somehow they brought him downward, out
of the Iron Range,
And brought a buggy to him while traces
creamed with foam;
Down through the purple foothills they brought
the black foal home.
Pet of the old grey homestead, he grew to
mammoth size, . .
And all of the ranges’ wildfire lived m his
wide, dark eyes;
And the man that. first bestrode him knew —
and his heart beat high—
That they had reared a treasure that money
could not buy.
And patiently they trained him with all the
horseman’s art,
Taught him to use the courage that welled
from his great heart.
Drive of his giant quarters, sweep of his mighty
stride,
Made him a mount as noble as ever wore a
hide.
A hundred well-bred horses, gems of the cattle
lands,
Graze on the Cranga horse-runs, answer the
Cranga hands,
And other hearts may falter and other flanks
may bleed:
No rowel stabs the black horse who thunders
to the lead.
Safe in the moonlit timber, true in the cold
grey morns,
Lord of the fiercest piker to charge with lowered
horns;
For boundless strength and courage, when gear
is flaked with foam,
They bless the day on Cranga that brought
The Orphan home.
QUEENSLAND.

"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
Queensland Fat Lambs.
“W.C.S.”; Has “S.R.W.” (B. 9/11/’46)
never heard of the shipment of Darling
Downs sucker carcasses organised by
Frank Prentice and sent to London in
1938-39? Smithfield described them as
some of the best lambs ever received from
Australia.
Despite the disabilities enumerated by
“5.R.W.,” Queensland does produce
prime lambs, and, in one of the toughest
seasons on record, no fewer than 700
suckers were penned at the British Breeds
and Corriedale Show and Sale Society’s
Toowoomba exhibition last September.
Their quality appealed to local and inter-
state visitors, to some of whom the dis-
play was an eye-opener.
Commentaries of theorists madden me ;
so do trite statements that “probably
the merino crossed with one of the
English longwools would produce the
required type of ewe.” Every successful
fat-lamb raiser on the Downs will
testify to the excellence of Border Lei-
cester or Romney Marsh cross ewes ;
the problem is to get them.
In the past large drafts of potential
lamb mothers were bought in N. S. Wales,
but it is out of the question to-day,
especially as Queenslanders have not
been educated to the same appreciation
of a high-priced ewe as their counter-
parts of Victoria and Riverina. Neverthe-
less, graziers on the marginal country be-
tween the Darling Downs and the merino
belt are nibbling at mating c.f.a. ewes
with British breed rams, and when they
♦discover what a money-making pro-
position it is there will be plenty of
crossbred ewes for everybody and a few
over for the N.S.W. market. “S.R.W.”
did not point out that up to now the
crossbred has been regarded in Queens-
land as the lowest form of animal life ;
it still is so regarded in many parts!
Wormy Sheep.
“Mr.”: In country of 2Uin. rainfall and
over, and in irrigation areas, worms not
only cause deaths of sheep but losses
in failure to grow and fatten, poor con-
dition and decreased wool values. Com-
plete eradication of all worms is practi-
cally impossible, but they can be kept
down.
For one thing don’t overstock—risks
of close grazing in wormy country are
obvious. Drain or fence off marshy
areas and dams—the latter are a source
of infection and are best supplied with
windmill and trough. Rotate the grazing
of pastures and always in the one
direction. Give the paddocks a good
burn at intervals or cultivate them. And
watch nutrition—a sheep on a highly-
nutritive pasture can stand up to a much
heavier infestation than a poorly-fed one.
On any pasture a supplementary ration of
meadow-hay, lucerne, oaten chaff or grain
will maintain nutrition above the danger
level.
Grain Sorghum.
“Ager”; In tests at Leeton (M.1.A.)
under irrigation Wheatland Milo topped
the yield with 95.86 bushels per acre.
Sowing rate was 121 b. per acre, with 36in.-
row spacings. Even with a sowing of
6ilb. 71.12 bushels were obtained.
Perfect grading of the land is essential
to ensure quick and even passing of
water over the surface. No water-hold-
ing pockets must be allowed. Quick,
light irrigations are best, and waterings
. must cease when heading-out is first
visible. Most suitable soils for sorghum
are deep loams or alluvials, since little
manuring is then required. It’s good
practice where there is good and medium
soil to put maize in the former and
“Draw him as he is — don't glamorise him."
sorghum in the latter. Sorghum does
well where maize fails.
An analysis of green fodder showed
that sorghum makes less demand than
maize upon the plant-food content of
the soil. A 15-ton crop of maize removes
approx. 1381 b. of nitrogen, 501 b. phos-
phoric acid and 1101 b. potash as against
sorghum’s 771 b., 301 b. and 771 b. respec-
tively. Thus sandy country and poor,
stiff clay soils give quite fair sorghum
crops. Best sowing time appears to be
from mid-October to mid-November.
Seeding rates recommended: 7in. rows,
151 b. per acre; Min. rows, 121 b.; 21in.
rows, 101 b.; 28-36 in. rows, 8-101 b.
Main trouble is weeds. Sorghum will
not thrive in dirty ground. Constant
cultivation is necessary until the crop is
at the flowering stage; which not only
kills the weeds, but helps the ground to
conserve moisture. Sorghum’s three good
points are its quick-maturing habit, its
drought-resistance and its ability to set
seed under the most adverse conditions.
More, the grain has such a high nutritive
ratio that it is good for all classes of
stock.
Fodder Conservation.
“Agric”: At Texas Station (on the
Queensland-N.S.W. border) the Scottish-
Australian Pastoral Co. has demonstrated
what can be done to conserve fodder
when the necessary finance is available.
A team of 11 men last year made 1300
tons of lucerne-hay and 400 tons of
silage. Most of the hay was railed to the
company’s properties in drought-stricken
New South Wales, while the silage kept
the station’s Aberdeen-Angus stud
breeders and weaners going strong
through the third-driest winter-spring
period on record. The station is managed
by J. H. Brewer, who was formerly
managing a lucerne property on the Lach-
lan River, and lucerne is now well-
established on 600 acres. Cattle graze the
lucerne in winter, and it is cut on an
average every four weeks from end of
September until early May.
Artificial Fertilisers.
“Rooster”: I’m with Robert Howie
(B. 9/10/’46). You can no more force
a crop than you can force a baby to
grow. What you can do is to increase
the yield, without decreasing the quality,
by scientific application of balanced feed-
ing. In that sense the term artificial, as
applied to chemical manures, is mis-
placed. Of course, overdressing or mulch-
ing, with an element already present in
the right proportion, automatically makes
it .superficial. And that is why too much
natural manure often spoils a crop. Ever
notice the rank clumps of grass fringing
the droppings from horses and cattle?
Doubtless farmyard manure is useful
to the small land holder, but what of
the great wheat areas? Back in 1898,
when the only source of nitrogenous
manures were the Chilean nitrate beds,
the threat of a world famine was averted
by an important discovery. Dr. Haber, a
German chemist, hit on a way to manu-
facture ammonia from the air. It served
a useful purpose during World War I;
Germany was able to manufacture sul-
phate of ammonia, and the world’s wheat-
belts today depend absolutely on these
synthetic nitrates.
A dairyfarmer doesn’t topdress pas-
tures with the idea of forcing growth.
Superphosphates make the grass succulent
and nourishing. In fact all agricultural-
ists know from experience that heavily-
cropped soils lose their fertility rapidly
without the application of phosphates. A
crop of wheat, for example, reaped when
the ears are ripe, removes from the
ground as much as 2001 b. of cal-
cium phosphate per acre. The maximum
bushels per acre cannot be obtained from
the use of natural manures; there wouldn’t
be enough of it to treat the tiniest
portion of the wheatbelts. So we use,
not artificial but chemical manures, to
keep the bread-hungry rrtillions from
starvation as far as possible.
Working-Bee Hives.
“Bumble”; As daily temperatures rise
the colonies, increasing rapidly in strength,
will need more hive space and supers
should be put on to relieve overcrowding.
With hives well-stocked with bees and
honey stores, a box of empty combs be-
low the brood chamber will induce the
queen to start laying there and extend
the amount of brood being reared. At
the height of the brood-rearing season
two storeys should be used for this pur-
pose, and changing them over every
10 or 12 days will help to keep breeding
at the maximum. The queen will seek
drone cells, so if all worker combs are
not available the frames with drone
comb should be placed to the outsides
of the boxes in an endeavor to reduce
drone-raising.
A survey of the honey flora within
two or three miles of the apiary and
eucalypts stand alone in this respect—will
enable the beekeeper to forecast the
season. Preparations should be made in
advance to take advantage of promising
honeyflows, and the hives should be at
full strength then to gather the crop,
which may be available for only a few
weeks. Weak hives will remain passengers
for the season.
First-year queens are the most prolific,
and they should be raised under the best
conditions. The outfit required for queen-
raising need not be elaborate, and it’s a
simple matter to graft selected larvae into
the wax cups. These are started in a
queenless hive and taken care of over an
excluder in a strong hive with plenty of
young bees to care for them. Well-
stocked hives With laying queens take
great care of queen embryos, which
usually turn out large, t robust and very
prolific.
The minimum of hives for the maxi-
mum honey is a good motto, and three-
or four-storey hives crammed with bees
is the ideal to work for. Migratory
beekeeping can be managed to keep the
bees gathering honey profitably for six
months of the year.
The Pea Mite.
“Jesmond”: It is useless trying to
control pea mite in a crop (B. 25/10/’46)
unless something is done to prevent the
pest coming in from surrounding grass-
land. A furrow right round the crop,
with a trail of sump oil on the bottom,
is effective, but it must be put down just
before the crop shows through. Dusting
with pea-mite powder controls the pest
in the crop, but constant vigilance is re-
quired and it may be necessary to dust
two or three times daily until the crop

tive powder can be made with phenyl
and sifted wood ash or finely ground
agricultural lime. Four or five ounces
of phenyl sprinkled into and well-mixed
with a kero.-tin of ash or lime will do
the job just as well as the most expensive
powder.
Rotation Crops.
“Jock’s Missus”; Rotation of crops is
essential to successful vegetable growing.
Leafy-green crops such as cabbage,
lettuce, silver beet, etc., require much less
potash and phosphoric acid than props
such as carrots, parsnips, potatoes, etc.,
so it is wise to follow roots with the sur-
face crop. Continuous growth of the
same variety of crop in one place will
cause a serious depletion in one or more
of the plant foods, with a consequent loss
of fertility.
Rotation helps the control of weeds,
pests and diseases; as the different crops
require different means of cultivation.
Leguminous crops such as peas and beans
increase the nitrogen content of the soil,
and can be advantageously followed by
leafy vegetables, e.g., cabbage, lettuce, etc.
As the leafy crops are always heavily
manured the ground is always ideal for
root crops to follow. Keeping all this
in mind, there is no excuse for poor
crops, provided, of course, plenty of
water is available.
Hints for the Farm.
“Mr.”: First symptom of pink-eye is a
slight watery discharge from the inner
corner of the eye, followed by inflam-
mation of the eye itself and surrounding
membranes. A milky film over the eye-
ball is the next development. Treat by
first cleaning the eye with a boracic acid
solution, two teaspoons in a pint of warm,
boiled water and then putting a few drops
of a lotion made up of ioz. sulphate
of zinc and H pints of boiled rainwater
in each eye. Keep sufferers handy in a
sheltered paddock while treatment is pro-
ceeding. Mild attacks usually last about
ten days, but severe cases may continue
for weeks. Both sheep and cattle are
subject to the disease.
“Malo”: Cattle-lice are not unknown
in N.S.W. (B. 13/11/’46). As a pre-
caution in bad seasons, when cattle are
weak and not resistant to disease and
vermin, it is a good plan to get rid of
light-colored beasts as they are usually
the first to be affected by lice. The
trouble may be well advanced before be-
ing noticed, even with Ayrshires. White
cattle often lack stamina and are subject
to skin troubles.
“Girrawheen”: Once the let-down of
milk has begun cows should be milked
rapidly. In slow milking the muscle
fibres around the alveoli fatigue within
six to eight minutes, making it im-
possible to remove ail the milk. Thus
fast hand-milkers obtain more milk than
slow ones. Repeated slow milking
always results in some milk being left at
each milking, and this means early dry-
ing-off.
“Myrrhee”: A depraved appetite in a
horse may be due to lack of lime. Try
a mineral supplement; stock salt, 60 parts
by weight, mixed well with agricultural
lime, 40 parts by weight, in boxes in the
yard or in a tray alongside each manger.
Sometimes a change of diet will correct
the depravity. Lucerne hay or chaff is
excellent.
“E.M.R.”: A young pig of (say) 10
weeks old whose hams fall away badly
may improve to some extent, but there
is always the chance that it won’t, so
immediate culling is the safest bet.
“Billjim”: Though the initial cost of
farm implements is high and spare parts
dear and difficult to obtain many farmers
still leave their machines in the paddock.
There should be no tax allowance for
depreciation on a neglected implement.
Machinery out of use should be stored
and checked for broken or damaged parts,
which should be replaced immediately.
Stored implements should be cleaned and
their working parts liberally smeared with
grease.
“Humos”: The suggestion (B.
30/10/’46) that a three-cornered file be
used as an anvil cutter overlooks the
danger to eyes and other parts of the
body. Files are hard and brittle, and
small jagged pieces are likely to fly about.
There is only one good metal cutter for
an anvil; that is the blacksmith’s “hardy,”
which fits in the square anvil hole. It has
stood the test of Centuries.
“C.S.”: One of the most useful books
of its kind is Handy Home and Farm De-
vices and How to Make Them, put to-
gether by J. V. Bartlett, who spent 10
or 12 years in research to get his material
and illustrations. The book isn’t for
sale, but goes to everyone who donates
£2 2s. to the N.S.W. Blinded Service-
men’s Welfare Trust. In South Australia
Bartlett’s book thus raised oyer £25,000
for blinded ex-servicemen in that State.
All the money is devoted to the cause,
and donations are allowable tax deduc-
tions. The book contains over 1500
ideas, all illustrated, and would be a wel-
come addition to any bookshelf.
“B.”: In late spring the swarming im-
pulse becomes active, and while there are
various means of minimising the sub-
sequent losses of bees to the colonies a
period of unrest must occur. Colonies
in numerical strength gather quantities of
honey far greater proportionately than
weak hives, which in many cases are.
barely able to maintain themselves. Be-
sides the losses by division of the colonies
at swarming there will be an inevitable
loss of field bees through the delay in
young queens laying. If increase is
desired, the hives‘may be divided at
swarming point, and the minimum of
delay will be had if previously-mated
queens are introduced to the extras.
“Bumble”: Apiarists working forest
country this summer should take extra
precautions against fires, which could
easily result from careless use of smokers
or an improper fireplace at the honey-
extracting shed. The loss of hives and
plant, itself a big blow to the small
owner, might be only a trifle compared
with the destruction of timber, and it’s
certain the locality won’t be much use
for honey-gathering for a long while to
come.
“E.V.S.”; Caustic soda will remove old
paint from woodwork, also the skin of
your hands if it splashes on them. Use
a long-handled mop. The trouble is to
get the soda out of the wood if the wood
is at all absorbent. Repeated washing and
long exposure to air are necessary, or the
new paint will not take. I used caustic
once with success and once wasting
of expensive paint on a job now looking
like a busted meat-pie. The best re-
mover is a blowlamp.
“Bill C.”: When painting over iron
roofs |B. 12/6/’46), rest your hoofs
against the nail-heads and avoid bending
the iron. Paint heavily over nail-openings
that appear likely to let in water. The
dry season is the time for going over roof-
spouts, repairing leaks and clearing out
debris. A leaky spout means loss of water
when a lucky storm arrives just before
the tank runs dry ; debris means similar
loss by overflowing.

When Britain planned her post-war network of air trans-
portation, the North Atlantic, Eastern and Southern routes
were allotted to 8.0.A.C. You can see the pattern of our
main line system in this map. As far West as New York, as
far East as Tokio, as far South as Johannesburg and Auckland,
run the lines to North America, the Middle East, Africa,
India, the Orient, Australia and New Zealand. That is our
part in the scheme of air travel: an important part, and one
we are proud to play. But, above everything else, a part
that has been very soundly rehearsed. Our men have been
pioneering, organising and flying the routes since the first
line to India was opened in 1929: which gives us 17 years
of learning how.

not be tormented and gnaw your tongue
with pain in that awful lake in which
molten brass is as ice?”
Jake, with a swift sidelong glance, sees
the sweat break out on Uncle Ted’s brow.
He goes pale and red again by turns. His
hands hang limp. This is what Uncle
Ted had always hoped to avoid. Now he
couldn’t escape from Mr. Keer’s fas-
cinating presence if he tried. Time stops
for him, and the frightful burning lake
of hell peopled by such as he amid the
torments of beasts with many heads and
more horns, this hell stretches into
eternity.
“The follower of the Scarlet Woman,”
shouts Mr. Keer, “he shall be past alive
into the lake of fire burning with brim-
stone.” %
It really is awful for poor Uncle Ted.
For Jake it isn’t so bad. The humor
of the situation tickles him, and he can’t
help grinning inwardly at Uncle Ted as
wejj as being sorry for him. Jake is at the
end of the bench near the side door of
the church, which is open. Outside, as a
little breeze flutters the leaves of a clump
of cabbage-trees, the sun glints and
sparkles on them. His rays play over a
big magnolia tree and shine on the glossy
leaves of karakas.
“Hear the words of the Book: And
they had tails like unto scorpions, and
there were stings in their tails, and their
power was to hurt men grievously ”
Sparrows hop and chatter under the
trees. Two have a tug-of-war for a crust
that some child has dropped. A fantail
flits here and tfiere looking for insects
on the wing.“
“.... Follow hail and fire mingled with
blood cast upon the earth, and the third
part of trees was burnt up, and all green
grass was burnt up ”
Jake lets his
eyes drink in
those pleasant
scenes outside,
and his mind
escapes from Mr.
Keer. The fantail,
with tiny delicate
and friendly
squeaks, flies in
the door, flutters
about the church
roof, and perches
a moment on the
end of the pew
by Jake. Its perky movements and pretty
tail seem to disconcert Mr. Keer.
Old deaf Joe, who takes the collection
box around, to please- the preacher hisses
a loud “shoo” and makes a pass at the
bird. But the little thing is too quick
for him and, cheekily friendly, it flits
around his head looking for flies, then
perches over the pulpit. Joe’s loud
‘ shoos” and “shishes” and passes only
annoy Mr. Keer.
“....Saying to all the fowls that fly
in the midst of heaven. Come and gather
unto the supper of the great God, that ye
may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh
of captains, and the flesh of mighty men,
and the flesh of all men, both free and
bond, both small and great And the
fowls were filled with their flesh.”
When at last the fantail does fly out
into the sunshine again Jake feels as
free and happy as the bird; while earth-
quakes roar and the kingdoms of the
world crash, as hell opens its gates and
its fumes poison the earth—and Uncle
Ted slowly dies.-
“Repent,” shouts Mr. Keer, “repent
before it’s too late!”
When it’s over somehow they get out-
side. People look at- Uncle Ted as if to
say, “Well, that sermon ought to do the
old rake some good!”
Uncle Ted harnesses the pony without
waiting to say goodbye or Gdd-bless-you
to anyone.
“If ever he comes again! ” he mutters.
“Who?” asks Jake.
“That cattle-lick man,” says Uncle Ted.
“The dirty scrubber! I’ll give him a kick
to blazes. It’s all his fault. Looking on
his calendar for the third Sunday of the
month! ”
“It can’t be the third Sunday,” Jake
says.
“Of course it isn’t. But why the devil
didn’t he turn up the right month of
the year when he gave me the calendar?”
When they get home and go inside
Uncle Ted rips the whole calendar off the
Bible picture sheet. “WeTe better with-
out a calendar,” he says. “We got along
all right before.”
With the calendar goes the hateful
heading—Koll Kattle-lick Co. And of
course that leaves only the picture of
Our Lord surrounded with the great
radiance, knocking at the weed-entangled
door. Underneath is an inscription that
Jake hadn’t noticed before. lAM THE
LIGHT OF THE WORLD, it says.
This picture Uncle Ted leaves hanging
on the wall by the blotchy looking-glass.
MORE and more, Jake notices. Uncle
Ted sits in the evenings after supper
staring at the picture of Our Lord. One
night, after an extra long silence, he says,
“Guess I’ll do a bit of grubbing to-
morrow. I see the blackberry spreading
everywhere, almost right up to the door
just like in that picture.”
And another night he says, “That
picture makes out Jesus Christ had to
put up with a lot of thistles, too. Well,
I’m going to get on to them in the top
paddock tomorrow. Can’t stand the look
of them no longer.”
And a few nights later he says, “That
there bright light in the night reminds
me. I must clean up my hurricane lamp
so’s not to be pottering about lost in the
dark now winter’s coming on.”
And again, spelling out one of the
remaining texts, “FEED MY FLOCK,”
Uncle Ted reads. “The Lord must have
known quite a bit about farming,” he
says, “Always did believe in feeding my
creatures. Sign of a good farmer.”
Indeed, it’s plain to Jake that some-
thing extraordinary has come over Uncle
Ted. It makes him just a little anxious.

In any arguments with my aunt which

formal duel with the foils. As uncle had
been a bit of an instructor in his day,
my aunt spent a good deal of her time
in hospital until she hit on the idea of
insisting on the choice of weapons. A
series of rather messy events followed, as
my aunt’s fancy ranged from red-hot pies
at 20 paces to hatpins at arm’s length.
Finally tiring of being alternately dry-
cleaned and sewn up, my uncle insisted
on confining the duels to comparatively
bloodless contests such as wrestling and

boxing. As both of them took their

nastic appliances for living-space. My
aunt was generally disqualified for biting
in clinches or knocking out the referee,
but got a good deal of quiet satisfaction
out of what were, after all, moral vic-
tories from her point of view.
Uncle’s system broke down, however,
when one of his bigamous wives, a circus
strong woman, returned unexpectedly to
claim him. It was while he was trying to
negotiate a championship bout between
his old flame and my aunt, who was by
now a mass of rippling muscle, that they

Quiz for Adjective-happy Cricket
Fans and Concertgoers.
Once in a decade of decades there
arises a genius who combines the triple
vocations of professional oyster-opener,
archaeologist and corset-designer. Once
in a century of decades there swims into
our ken one who can in the compass of
two galley proofs sock a soprano for a

This paragon of ours, fancier of the
forcing shot and connoisseur of the con-
certo, flagellator of the flautist and bete
noire of the bosie artist, cut his cricketing
teeth on the two crashing chords with
which the Beethoven Third, Opus 55 in
E Flat, opens. It is on record that when
he heard the basic theme of the move-
ment taken up a sixtieth of a second too
soon by the horns, clarinets and flutes in
octaves, his boiled shirt simmered with a
royal rage until the contrasting theme was
taken up correctly by oboe and strings,
And it is now a matter of history that,
having cut his musical teeth on a ragged
shot to mid-on during a Test match at
Old Trafford, and having thereupon
noticed a loose one, he, yielding not to
the temptation to bang it through the
covers for four or pull it out with a piece
of string tied to the door, advocated in
a strong letter to the Manchester
“Guardian” that treatment of the ’cellos’
presentation of the allegro movement
should be quasi improvisando, thus caus-
ing a furore in musico-cricketing circles
and ovals.
He leaped, rather than climbed, to
fame by being the first to liken a delicate
leg-glance by Kippax to the Matterhorn
viewed through a mist on a late-autumn
day. When he followed this up by
comparing the sound of the whizz from
a Gregory bumper outside the off stump
to the cry of a muezzin from his minaret
Sir Thomas Beecham was overcome—so
much so that he couldn’t talk about him-
self for a week; and a Queen’s Hall re-
citalist burst two G strings—his own and
his violin’s.
Nobody before or since has succeeded
by wedding flights of poetic fancy to the
bashing of a leathern sphere by a spring-
handled piece of willow in raising such
a prolific crop of imitators, the combined
efforts of whom have raised more shud-
ders from newspaper readers, from Lord’s
to the Melbourne C.G., than all the
castor oil that has been cold-drawn since
Italy was discovered.
A true virtuoso himself, he plays on
the vitriol as Kreisler on his violin. His
glissando on the typewriter, .which is in-
variably tuned to B sharp, is indeed
something at which to marvel. One of
the proudest possessions of the M.C.C.
is a bowling analysis which he orches-
trated.
He can pull a cricket-fan’s leg with a
sly humor and the same effortless action
that he uses in flicking over a thesaurus.
Observed while the symphony orchestra
is playing under a conductor who hasn’t
been imported, he appears to be absorbed
in the music ; but if one could take a
look into his brain-box one might see
condemnatory phrases being meticulously
spun against the imminent hour of their
use.
Trevor Wignall has been gnashing his
teeth for so many years through being
beaten by our Knight of the Copy to the
coining of such juicy phrases as “Pavlova
of the popping crease” and “D’Artag-
nan of the flashing bat,” to endless
synonyms from rapiers to bludgeons
and from Jovian thunderbolts to floating
six-stitched bubbles, that he has worn
them down to the nerves and has now to
rely solely on insults for his desperately-
needed publicity.
It has been said of our hero that he
can take Bloch and then, going Bach
almost 6n to his stumps, full-bloodedly
lift a metaphor over the fence before the
final chords of the Fugue in C Minor
can move to parallel major.
An institution without whom the con-
cert platform or the Bulli-soiled sward
wouldn’t seem the same, he is withal
held in no little affection by other bats-
men on the Inky Wicket who view some-
times with astonishment his adjectival
coruscation as he brings his vocabulistic
battery into action.
Were he to end the last line of his
copy with the words “jarred us” and
sign his name thereunder, a nicely-
rhymed couplet would be the result.

THE OTHER FELOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
per line; all others 2£d. per line.
Partnership ?
When wedded to the sharer of my
joys and sorrows I repeated the words,
“With all my worldly goods I thee
endow,” and if I had then any mental
reservations about the projected endow-
ment I was ;very soon disabused of them.
Literally and absolutely my wife enjoys
an equal J share with me of the meagre
rewards of .my labor. And, of course,
she deserves it; On the' few occasions
when I have “batched” I have spent my
few leisure minutes wondering how one
small womancan do all she does.
She makes it possible for me to go off
to work each morning refreshed, fed and
cleanly clothed, secure in the knowledge
that my goods and chattels will be well
cared for J and adequately maintained.
She welcomes me home each evening to a
cheerful, well-kept. home and a well-
cooked meal. She maintains my morale
and plays a great part in maintaining me
as an efficient worker. In other words,
our partnership is one to which my wife
contributes a'good half of the work and
thought.
But the Government does not regard
our partnership as a partnership at all.
In the Government’s view I am the sole
worker, of the family and my wife is a
financial encumbrance, to be offset a little
by a miserly rebate of my income-tax.
Not, of course, sufficiently an encum-
brance to justify any rebate of the multi-
tude of 'other taxes that make the weekly
wage look so pitifully small.
Suppose lam earning £8 a week. My
employer deducts from my wage £1 3s. Bd.
against my taxation assessment. The
single man who works at the same bench
with me and earns the same pay has
£1 12s. 4d. deducted. He has £6 7s. Bd.
left as the income of one person and I
have £6 16s. 4d. left as the income of two
persons. Out of that Bs. Bd. per week I
have to pay my wife’s share of the sales
tax, postal surcharge, the entertainments
tax and the customs and excise duties. The
balance of the Bs. Bd. is the Government’s
assessment of what my wife is worth as a
useful member of the community.
A friend of mine is earning the basic
wage of £5 a week and his wife has a job
that pays £3 a week. Their total deduc-
tions for income tax amount to 16s. 4d.
weekly, leaving them £7 3s. Bd. as against
my £6 16s. 4d. But then, of course, his
wife works and mine doesn’t. Or does
she?
Isn’t it about time the Government
showed some appreciation of the fact that
wives are useful and even necessary
members of the community, and that a
married man’s wage represents the in-
come of two persons?
If two-fifths of a married man’s earn-
ings, up to a maximum of, say, £5OO a
year, were regarded as his wife’s earnings
and taxed as such, something like justice
would be done. —C. G. Salis (N.S.W.).
Script-writers
“Bondi Beachcomber’s” case for the
Australian writer (B. 13/11 /’46) applies
equally to radio script-writing. True, the
return is a little more than £1 per
1000 words, but in comparison with over-
seas prices it is woefully low. In many
cases actors in the play receive more than
the author. Is it any wonder that there
are complaints about-the poor quality
of radio entertainment when there is so
little inducement to turn out first-class
scripts? It’s good to see one’s work recog-
nised by the critics, but it would be better
to see the size of the cheques increased
accordihgly.—Bozo (Vic.),
Leprosy in Australia
I’d like to correct “Galenus” on several
points about leprosy. , Firstly, the inci-
dence among whites can hardly be called
“scattered”—cases appear in fairly well-
defined endemic areas; that extending
from Rockhampton (Q.) to Springsure
accounts for more than half the cases.
Mackay follows Rockhampton, and from
these places the incidence for whites (as
far as is known) decreases to the north
and south. Among aboriginals, however,
the incidence appears to increase as one
goes north.
The lazaret at Peel Island is used only
for white patients, of whom it now has
over 50. As there are approximately 50
more patients on parole, the total of
white cases known is over 100. There
are about 70 native cases on Fantome
Island, in the Palm Islands group. The
proportionate incidence for natives is
therefore higher than for whites. To all
these must be added an unknown number
of cases as yet undiagnosed or avoiding
detection—people do avoid detection be-
cause they think that once on Peel their
doom is sealed, whereas, in fact, four or
five patients are discharged every year.
Their peace of mind will be further
diminished by “Galenus’s” statement
that “no cure has' yet been discovered.”
While that is true in a strict sense, it is
not true in the practical sense. There are
drugs available which will produce a
practical cure, the time required depend-
ing on the progress made by the disease
before treatment is started. The Queens-
land Government has stated that a new
treatment —Promin—is on its way from
America, and the results obtained from
the use of this drug at Carville Lepro-
sarium in Louisiana have been remark-
able. Latest information indicates they
are discharging patients at the rate of
four to five a month. But whatever drugs
are used the greatest hope for the patient
lies in early diagnosis and treatment be-
fore the infectious stage is reached.
The disease is far from being confined
to or making its first appearance in young
people—the high standard of living in
Australia seems to lengthen the incuba-
tion period, with the result that the
disease makes its appearance generally
when advancing age lowers the resistance
of the body.
Public opinion regarding leprosy is still
back in the Middle Ages. The leprosy
of the Bible is not leprosy as we know it
today, and it is thought that a Hebrew
word covering a number of skin diseases
was wrongly translated as leprosy. The
public should remember that those who
“Well, we didn't get our m an—but what odds!"
are segregated are prisoners in a war
against a disease and not,outcasts. They
are performing a public service by being
in an institution, a service whereby the
majority of Australians can live in the
assurance that they will not themselves
contract leprosy.— Maroomba (Q.).
Seed Wheat
This year many farmers will need seed,
and, with no price control, they will have
to pay practically overseas prices. It is
an extraordinary state of affairs that a
farmer who has been supplying the rest
of Australia at a “home-consumption”
price should have to pay above that price
for wheat that would not even have to be
f.a.q.
Surely it would be a simple master
for a farmer needing seed to get this
year’s wheat and know what he is getting.
The seller could deliver to rail and get
his weight and, with local buyers any-
way, the load could be delivered straight
to the farm. Last year’s wheat stack is
available, but it is all mixed, and a
grower could easily find himself with
early, late and mid-season varieties grow-
ing side by side.—B. L. D. (N.S.W.).
Westralian Strike Reflections
Many people who, like myself, don’t
vote for Labor still admire the Labor
movement for what it has achieved. All
the present industrial turmoil does not
negate the facts of that achievement. In
many occupations both parties approach
the Arbitration Court for formal ratifica-
tion of changes in awards which have al-
ready been agreed upon at round-table
conferences; in many occupations em-
ployees receive pay and privileges in
excess of the ruling award. For these
evidences of a healthy spirit between
employer and employee the Labor move-
ment must receive its share of credit.
But, having won its battle against
class-oppression and sweating, having led
the employer to realise that his own
success is dependent upon happy em-
ployees, having established the funda-
mental right of the worker to enjoy the
best possible working conditions, the
Labor movement is no longer engaged in
a fight against capitalism. Its enemies are
those within its own ranks who seek to'
destroy the democratic way of life.
In Westralia a union of 1300 men flung
into unemployment over 80,000 workers,
including nearly 10,000 co-workers on the
Government railways. This strike, like
others in other States, resolves into an
issue of whether Labor can continue to
allow a minority to rule the lives and wel-
fare of the majority. If it is to maintain
solidarity within its ranks Labor must de-
vise adequate machinery by which all
those who suffer indirectly or directly
from a strike are given the chance to ex-
press an opinion before the strike begins.
One suggestion might be for all union
funds, over and above the requirements
of normal administration, to be kept in a
trust account and released for strike pur-
poses only on the decision of a secret
ballot at which all unionists directly or
indirectly affected by a strike would be
permitted to vote.
In the Westralian strike the Premier's
statement to the House contradicted the
public utterances of the president of the
striking union, and, it is reasonable to infer
that the members of this union did not
hear the Premier’s case until after they
had elected to strike. It seems, there-
fore, that union members need to be
better protected against deliberate or un-
conscious misrepresentation by their
bosses of the other side’s case. A repre-
sentative of the employers (be they private
or State) might well be allowed to state
their case to a general meeting of the
strikers. Similarly a worker’s represen-
tative should be allowed to address a
general meeting of employers.
Labor’s problem today is that the
unionist has been taught blindly to obey
his union bosses. This blind obedience
has become a weapon which may destroy
its master. The Westralian railway' strike
shows the crossroads to which Labor has
come—the choice between a continuance
of unswerving loyalty to the orders of
the union leaders or the development of
“the sense of individual responsibility
for our democratic ideals.”
* Any such relaxation of Labor discipline
would widen the gap between those who
seek increasing support from a friendly
capitalism and those who favor socialisa-
tion of industry. The former feel that
the State is a less benevolent employer
than the progressive individual who is
ready to give away a percentage of his
profits as bonuses and general amenities
for his staff. The socialist orators jeer at
the “crumbs from the rich-man’s table,”
but the thoughtful worker understands
that the crumbs are really a slice which
will inevitably become larger if moderate
Labor helps in the baking of the cake.
The problem is aggravated by Com-
munists, who find the best avenues for
their propaganda in those, occupations
which are less-efficiently controlled — i.e.,
in State enterprises. It follows that the
Communists will see advantage to them-
selves in splitting the Labor ranks.
Nobody can foretell which road the
Labor party will elect to follow, but only
the Communists and a handful of reac-
tionary conservatives will hope it chooses
badly. Governing or in opposition,
a sound and moderate Labor party must
always be of national value. So, strained
though he is by high taxation and indus-
trial turmoil, the employer should not
pay the Communist game by threatening
lockouts or resisting any reasonable claim
for industrial reform.— Peter Mike
(W.A.).
A One-man Strike
I met a carpenter the other day who,
returning from the' 1914-1# war, saved
his money and between building houses
for other people built a few for himself.
Just before the 1939-45 war, though still
working as a journeyman, he had built
himself into a snug position. While tax-
ation through the war years bit heavily
into his income, he paid up cheerfully and
worked on, until, the war over, he en-
tered the new order.
Now this carpenter has found that
the only difference between the old and
new orders is that, where the old was
cluttered with Governments, their im-
posts, taxes, regulations and bureaucrats,
the new one is lousy with them. Swarms
of officials have to be housed, fed and
paid, and their regulations and imposts
are stuck on everything from eggs and
honey to cement and wallpaper. Before
you can do anything you have to see an
official about it, and as he usually has
no power to do anything except to stop
you from doing it he has to see someone
else before he can let you start.
So in no time the carpenter was work-
ing for £3 10s. a week, the Government
collecting the rest of his wages—his rent
roll put him in that classification.. At last
he was so browned-off that he staged a
one-man strike. He is now letting the
housing shortage run on until he can at
least call a reasonable part of his wages
his own.
This gives color to the election promise
that the present Queensland Government,
if returned, will guarantee work in the
building trade for the next 10 years.
In the circumstances, it should be the
easiest promise to keep that any Govern-
ment ever made.— Sawdust Warrior
(Q-).
New Guinea Natives
So “Nogat” (B. 13/11 /’46) is reaping
the whirlwind of high prices sown by the
war years in N.G. Many planters and
traders returning to the islands have
found that the fuzzy-headed angel is not
the boy he used to be. Contact with army
life and various sharp practices has
brought a certain sophistication to the
“simple” boong, and will be the cause
of a good many administrative headaches
in the future.
When my unit landed in N.G. the
souvenir trade was already well estab-
lished, but the only price the natives
seemed to know was “two bob.”. This
applied to anything from a string of
beads or a couple of coconuts to ricketty
toy canoes (lakatois), but it was not long
before the vocabulary increased to “ten
bob.” One Sunday Namu did great busi-
ness in the camp and went off tucking
a fat roll of notes in the folds of his lap-
lap. Later I met him wandering down
the road, and he told me he had lost his
money—“plenty too much tail.” With a
cheerful grin he said there would be
“plenty more ten bob come longa ’nother
Sunday,”
It may be true that “an honest man
could starve in Rabaul today,” but I’m
sure it won’t be our fuzzy-headed friends.
—Bozo (Vic.).
Unions
The subject on the air was “Would
profit-sharing solve industrial unrest?”
and the speaker, who was agin the idea,
stated firmly and calmly that profit-
sharing was a- scheming trick to wean
workers from the trade-unions to make
them docile and happy “slaves” and thus
increase production and profits for the
boss.
His argument boiled down to this: no
matter how good for the worker any such
scheme might be, it was bad in essence if
it tended to estrange him from the unions.
In other words, the unions were not so
much concerned with the welfare of the
workers as with their own political
strength. It did not matter that profit-
sharing was able to offer more than the
most powerful trade-union could ever
hope to accomplish for the workers.
Such a viewpoint betrays the existence
of a vested interest in industrial strife.
If the mere welfare of the worker were
the ultimate goal of the unions, then any'
plan would be examined on its merits with
actual results the only criterion of its
worth. Not here, however. The good or
evil results of any plan were of no im-
portance. What did matter was, how did
it affect the status of the unions?
—R. H. G. (W.A.).
Land for Housing
In Queensland people who want a
home-building site must pay through the
neck to the Housing authority or aban-
don their ambition.
This Housing authority acquired two
scalps of land in Toowoomba, one piece
being bought for £2840 and the other for
£2160. It is proposed to subdivide these
areas into home-building sites and to
sell at average prices of £B4 and £B6
per 23-perch block—an area large enough
for only a cottage, an outhouse and a
clothesline. One of these scalps of land
is heavily overgrown with trees, hedges,
shrubs and vines and portion of it is low-
lying and subject to erosion.
Across the street, not more than 200
yards distant, there is cleared freehold
land ready for building operations; but
the owners cannot obtain sub-Treasury
consent to sell 23-perch allotments at £4O.
And owners of land half a mile away are
officially forbidden to sell at £2O per
quarter-acre block, although for years
they have paid rates on Local Govern-
ment valuations of £2O to £3o.—Equity
(Q.). r

The R.S.L.
“J.W.R.” (B. 4/9/’46) uses the familiar
hut inaccurate argument that all members
of the R.S.L. have had "actual experi-
ence of the horrors of war.” Thousands
of R.S.L. members never heard a shot
fired in anger; their only experience
of the “horrors of war” was a saving
in income tax. Many members of non-
combatant units suffered less risk to lire
and limb than jungle-school, paratroop
and armored-division trainees on the
mainland.
As an argument in his favor, “J.W.R.
states that in 1918 there were men in
camp ready to embark when that war
ended who were not permitted to
join the League. They should have been,
just as last-war volunteers should be. It
is only quibbling to say that men who
wanted to volunteer but were kept in
key industries have 4s much right to
claim membership as A.I.F. volunteers.
If a man wanted to enlist strongly enough
he managed to get into uniform some-
how. '
Many ymored-division men joined up
in 1940 and spent five-and-a-half heart-
breaking years in Australia while they
watched their cobbers and younger
brothers join up later and go overseas.
Surely “J.W.R.” doesn’t suggest that these
men are not entitled to League member-
ship when a “tourist” who spent a month
or two in New Guinea checking records,
surveying base areas and the like is wel-
comed.—C. S. (N.S.W.).
Perhaps there will be a rush by “thou-
sands of so-called soldiers who fought only
one fight, a fight to avoid being sent
overseas,” to join the R.S.L. But there
are other thousands of genuine triers who
won’t because of this typical example of
the attitude in which the R.S.L. is accept-
ing the new ruling.
I am one of the latter, but, despite the
absence of a badge, my conscience is easy.
I joined the’*R.A.A.F. in 1940, and at the
end of my training was sent as a flying-
instructor to Central Flying School with-
out consultation or a chance to appeal.
For the next four years I was left on this
monotonous job,' despite efforts of my
own and several C.Os. to get an opera-
tional posting.
Those years were not without their
anxious moments, as anyone who knows
anything about flying training will tell
om. For my part I flew over 2000 hours
and trained or helped to train 424 pilots.
Anci I saw several fellow-instructors
killed in flying accidents.
Eventually, in April, 1945, I got an
operational posting, but by the time I had
completed an O.T.U. and taken embarka-
tion leave the war was over. —G. M.
(Tas.).
I have in mind two cases, both resident
in the village which has the privilege
of providing the butter for my bread.
One man enlisted in 1916 and -got as
far as Horseferry-road, where he swung
a pen in a soldierly manner. He wears
the League badge, but not that of the
local sub-branch where so many fighting
men gather. The other fellow joined the
R.A.A-F. as soon as recruiting com-
menced, gained his wings and pulled
every wire to get into the scrap. At each
attempt he came a regimental g.—they
kept him in training squadrons, where he
took newchums aloft, sitting behind each
pupil with his life in the trainee’s hands.
No wonder he is bitter when he sees the
other chap with the League badge in his
coat. — Jobber (N.S.W.).
As a member of the R.S.L. since 1919
I am disgusted with the attitude of
members and branches who talk of break-
ing away and forming Battle Veterans’
Associations and what have you. A
matter which was discussed by branches
for six years has been decided demo-
cratically under the League consti-
tution. It is up to those members who
may not agree with the decision to accept
it as the verdict of the majority and stick
to the organisation which has always been
the Diggers’ show. I saw active service in
both wars and I’d be only too pleased to
welcome any man who volunteered to
serve as a fellow-member. All Diggers
should rally to the organisation instead of
splitting it. — Recco (N.S.W.).
The League was originally formed as
an association of men who had definitely,
seen active service. Once this essen-
tial rule is broken or ignored the value
and status of the League will merely be
on a par and in competition with other
existing and newly-forme,d ex-service
associations. In view of the need for
unity and co-operation, however, those
who unsuccessfully volunteered for active
service could be admitted to the League
as associate members with a slightly-
altered badge to indicate their associa-
tion with the League. The badge of the
League has generally been accepted as
identifying the wearer as a man who did
see active service. It will be a great pity
if and when it loses that status. —J. W. A.
(N.S.W.).
The Interim Army
Enlistments in the Interim Army are
only a trickle, and an all-out publicity
campaign is about to be initiated glamor-
ising life in the Army. This seems to be
a case of shutting the stable-door after
the horse has bolted.
When the war ended there was a period
of six weeks before demobilisation even
commenced. It was two or three months
before anyone but very “high pointers”
were demobbed. During that time there
were many inquiries from men interested
in the Interim Army and the occupation
forces. Their names were taken and in
some cases unit returns were asked for
two or three times. Many men, parti-
cularly young, single chaps who had not
been overseas, were anxious to enlist in
the occupation forces, but nothing was
heard from “higher up” and no definite
information could be given to them.
Finally when demobilisation was almost
complete the Army stated its Interim
Army and occupation-force policy.
Those previously interested have now
been discharged, and are settling down
into the routine of civvy life again.
Dilatoriness in high places has been the
main cause of the lack of enlistments.—
C. S. (N.S.W.).
Food Parcels
I live near a group of old folks’
bungalows. These are mainly occupied
by elderly women who have worked all
their lives in the big woollen mills of the
West Riding and are now trying to eke
out their last years on the old-age pen-
sion.
Rationing is, of course, very severe on
everyone here, but none is so hard hit
as the old-age pensioners, living alone,
trying to stretch out their minute single
rations and without the means to
“Make it snappy, Harry—my hubby's down below tonight!”
the occasional extras in the shops. The
recent distribution of Australian gift
foods was a red-letter day in their lives.
I feel sure these gifts are sent with no
thought of receiving any thanks, but I
should like to convey a little of the ap-
preciation felt by these old people,, lonely
and tired after many hard years of war,
when they receive these tokens of good-
will and practical help from overseas
M. Webb (Shipley, Yorkshire).
Dutch at Close Quarters
A recent expedition to recover some
mining machinery took us to Riouw
Archipelago, where the Dutch had done
some smart “recce” work for us. We (two
men) travelled down from Singapore
with the Resident of Riouw in his sloop.
On landing a car was put at our dis-
posal, and everything possible was done
to facilitate our mission. We were lodged
in the best bungalow on the mine
(bauxite) and entertained to drinks
by the mine staff and by Government
men engaged on recovery and restitution
of Dutch and non-Dutch property. Their
promptness and efficiency did for us in
one month what Malayan official “tida-
pathy” required four months to do.
Of the 12 Dutchmen on the mine nine
were “in the bag” in various parts of
Asia, and the rest in Europe. Two of
them had their wives and families still m
Indonesian hands. None of the nine had
seen Holland for six years, some not for
14. Over drinks one evening I asked one
of them when he would be going home
to Holland.
“I shall not go back to Holland,’ he
said. “My younger son was killed in the
invasion of Holland in 1940 ; my younger
daughter was killed by the Nazis; my
brother was killed in the bombing of
Amsterdam; my elder daughter killed
herself, and then my wife died in 1944.
My other son, about to sit for his doc-
torate, was killed in the landing on
Borneo last year. When my work is
finished here I will go to your Great
Barrier Reef for some fishing.
The others confirmed this story. It is,
of course, an extreme case, but there are
many extreme cases, and for them the
war is still on. All Dutchmen are con-
scripted to remain in the East during the
rehabilitation— only a medical board or
official permit can get them home to
Holland. _ ; ,
This is not an apology for the Dutch
—we were both on the Burma railway
with them, and we know just where we
rubbed each other up. But we’ll under-
stand each other better when we drop
the ignorant insularity characteristic of so
many Aussie comments on all non-
Aussies. Too much of it has already got
into print.— B. S. M. (Pahang, F.M.S.).
Licensing Radio-servicemen
“Broadcast Engineer” (B. 13/11/ ’46)
should know that the P.M.G.’s Depart-
ment controls radio and is thus respon-
sible for maintaining standards. At
present that responsibility is not being
fully discharged, for, while the depart-
ment lays down certain standards which
it requires broadcast stations to observe
and to which receivers conform, it does
not control the. kind of repair service
which the set owner receives, although
it will prosecute him if he neglects to
buy a listening licence.
In another field, the electrical authorities
insist that a licensed electrician be en-
gaged when even the most minor repair
in an electrical installation is carried out.
Yet, although the majority of radio-
receivers operate on that same source of
power, there is no authority to ensure
that a repair man is competent —he
could conceivably leave the receiver elec-
trically alive and, therefore, extremely
dangerous. I have actually seen that
happen three times.
As for qualifications for a licence,
radio-servicing is a trade, and a highly
skilled and lucrative one. Surely it is
not too much to expect somewhat simi-
lar conditions to those prevailing in other
trades an apprenticeship with the
necessary course of study and the pass-
ing of specified examinations. Men prac-
tising already as radio-servicemen could
sit for a qualifying examination. — Hut

The Population Problem
“Surrey” (B. 13/11 /’46) misses the
point in assessing the difference between
the Australian and Chinese birthrates.
The Chinese can’t be classed as a primi-
tive people. They have an ancient and
highly-developed culture, in some respects
superior to ours. Except in times of
flood, famine, drought and political up-
heaval, their social structure is more
stable than our own, and one of the fac-
tors in its stability is the family system.
The reason why Chinese parents have
lots of offspring is that children are
an economic advantage to them. The
children of farmers become farmers, and
the children of craftsmen become crafts-
men in their fathers’ workshops. Families
in Australia tend to become small be-
cause children are brought up to be an
economic disadvantage to their parents.
Every child is a fresh mouth to be fed,
and has to be educated generally for a
profession different from that of his
father. He -adds nothing to the family’s
wealth, even when he comes of age, be-
cause he usually marries and sets up as
an isolated unit. •
Until this situation is altered moral
admonitions, appeals to patriotism and
the howls of politicians that the White
Australia policy is menaced will fall on
deaf ears. — Feng-Shui (Vic.).
Arts and Crafts
The Red Cross and service hospitals
•have been responsible for a minor re-
vival of arts and crafts. In the
name of “Physio and Occupational
Therapy” thousands of ex-servicemen
and -women have acquired the knack
of making useful articles from odds and
ends. I have seen majors and colonels
working on toys with the same enthusiasm
as that of privates embossing intricate
designs on hand-made leather wallets and
handbags.
These acquired skills have been
carried into civvy life. In my immediate
circle one girl weaves fabrics for her
own frocks and suits; a company secre-
tary turns out all the sandals and slippers
his family requires; another goes in for
inlay jewel boxes and trays. The lass in
the office makes all her own leather gloves
and the chap next door specialises in
novel wooden toys.
The revival of interest in these ancient
handicrafts is a direct tribute to the Red
Cross, which organised materials and
tools and provided competent trained in-
structors, Incidentally, in these days of
prohibitive prices it’s a big advantage to
be able to supply at least some of the
family requirements. — Weaver (N.S.W.).
What Do They Expect?
I have a friend, quite a decent chap,
who is half a Commo. He did not go so
far as to vote for the Commo candidate
in his electorate, but he says there may
be something in Communist ideas. There
are a disturbing number in the same
frame of mind, but none of them can
explain exactly what the Commo heaven-
on-earth would be like. Because they
are vaguely dissatisfied with things as
they are, they are in danger of making
a blind date with Communism.
I know the aims of Commo leaders
—to disrupt and destroy our social and
economic structure so that a few of them
may snatch power out of the wreck.
They are out to dominate, whatever il
costs the rest of us. But I would like
some innocent dupe of theirs to tell me
what he expects to get out of it. He
surely does not want the sort of mass
servitude under which the Russian people
exist. What, then, is the form of society
for which he is uncertainly groping?
For what “paradise” is he willing to
jettison our tradition of progress by evo-
lution, compromise and patience? —
Mugski (N.S.W.).
Solidarity
A mass meeting at Newport (Vic.)
railway workshops unanimously de-
cided to boycott this season’s big
cricket. Fervently calling on all
unionists for support, the meeting con-
demned the Government for permitting
higher admittance charges while hypo-
critically pretending that nothing could
be done about the basic wage.
I thought of this when I saw the 44,000
people that swarmed into the M.C.G. on
the rainy, blowy Saturday of the England
v. an Australian Eleven match. I had
never imagined that there were so mauy
capitalists, bosses, monopolists, Fascists
and society drones in Melbourne. The
hearty crowd loudly enjoying itself in the
outer must have come from this class, for,
as Bigshot Brown of the A.R.U. points
out, the one thing that makes the workers,
and the railway workers in particular, so
powerful is their “solidarity.” — Yarra-
sider (Vic.).
The Banks and the Loan
The Loan slogan, “Better than Bank In-
terest,” was tough in view of the fact that
bank rates are pegged as predetermined
by the Government. Even tougher is the
fact that, as in the past, the private banks
are asked to play the part of salesmen
for Security Loan bonds, to provide most
of the selling machinery, to advertise
the loan by every means while being thus
publicly and profusely castigated as Shy-
locks.
How long the banks are . expected to
tolerate these kicks, pull their great weight
and keep their mouths shut is an interest-
ing speculation for some of us who know
the inner workings of present-day Loan
promotion.
One thing is certain, old hands on
the Commonwealth Bank staff cannot
condone this sort of propaganda
