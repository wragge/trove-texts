The Future of the Drama
Some sixty years ago Tennyson fore-
casted the time when English drama would
die right out, or
flicker down to brainless pantomime,
And those gilt gauds men-children swarm to see.
And now Thomas Hardy, in his introduction
to “The Dynasts,” wonders “whether mental
performance alone may not be eventually the
fate of all drama other than that of con-
temporary or frivolous life.” It is a big
question. As Hardy points out, “the medi-
tative world is older, more nervous, more
quizzical, than it was. At the stage to which
the general critical mind has developed, the
theatre-goer demands reality, or at least what
approximates to reality, or else the admit-
tedly unreal pantomime and gilt-gauds play
that Tennyson foretold. The latter of course
is not drama at all. The great difficulty the
present-day dramatist immediately meets as
far as stage presentation is concerned is
with his intellectual characters. How is the
thinking man to be staged? With the per-
fection of stage mechanism dramas of action
can be presented in fashion) realistic enough
to satisfy the most critical. The play of
ideas can also be easily staged in a capable
manner. But when the play that deals with
mental tragedy—and all great tragedies are
mental tragedies—comes up for stage pre-
sentation, then the trouble really begins. In
the modern demand for an approximation to
reality the soliloquy has to go, and without
soliloquy how can the mind struggles of a
profound man or woman be presented on the
stage?
Human beings might be roughly divided
into two classes —mind people and people of
action ; people who live inwardly, and people
who live outwardly. The former are always
more or less introspective; the latter are not
introspective at all. The former, looking
within themselves, have always more or less
a fear hovering over them that others might
see them as they see themselves. The other
people, who never look within, never know
that fear; wherefore, with nothing like so
much intellectual power, they have generally
much more confidence and are much more
sure of themselves than the mind people. So
the things they do and say to a certain ex-
tent reveal them, whereas the things the
mind people do and say more often than
not serve to keep them concealed. Very
obviously, then, if characters belonging to
these two classes are to be presented on the
stage, different methods must be employed.
With the presentation of the outward-
living man little difficulty is experienced.
The things he says and his manner of saying
them reveal him. This refers both to a
strong character like Hotspur and a weak
character like Shallow. The' hot-tempered,
impetuous, impatient, generous Hotspur lives
before us in the words he speaks to the other
characters in the play. And Shallow’s very
first words, “Gome on, come on, come on;
give me your hand, sir; give me your hand,
sir; an early stirrer, by the rood., And how
doth my good cousin Silence?” reveals the
wordy, self-important little justice for all
time. Shakspeare’s method of presenting
such characters is to make them speak them-
selves to the other characters, and then for
one other character to sum them up. Fal-
staff sums up Justice Shallow in this way.
And other characters sum up Falstaff. Some-
times Shakspeare’s outward-living men solilo-
quise, but such soliloquising is never self-
revealing. Take away the soliloquies of Fal-
staff and Henry V. and you do not know
them any less well; but take away the solilo-
quies of Hamlet or Macbeth or lago, and you
do not know these characters at all. All this
is true of, life. If your neighbor is an out-
ward-living man you will probably know him
well; but if he is an introspective man, even
though he enters your house every day you
will never really know him at all. lago will
not wear his heart upon his sleeve. Nor will
Macbeth’s mind construction be revealed in
his face. Hamlet’s very first speech deals
with this matter. Speaking to his mother he
says:—
Seems, madam ! Nay, it is ; I know not seems.
’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forc’d breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,
Together with all forms, modes, shows of grief,
That can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem,
For they are actions that a man might play;
But I have that within, which passeth show.
Macbeth is sometimes regarded as a man of
action, and the antithesis of Hamlet. But
he is an inward-living man, and no more a
man of action than is Hamlet. He thinks
too precisely on the event just as Hamlet
does, and is just as helpless after the event
as Hamlet is before it. And, as Hamlet, he
stands revealed to us only in soliloquy.
_ In Ibsen’s play, “The Pretenders,” where
his greatest intellectual character, Earl
Skule, appears, Ibsen uses soliloquy and a
foil. This foil is the Skald —a poetical crea-
tion, who serves as a sort of ear for the
thinking aloud of the Earl. In his later
plays, seeking a J closer approximation to
reality, Ibsen drops the soliloquy altogether
and uses the foil more and more. But this
thinking aloud is really little less artificial
than soliloquising, and will not be tolerated
by the modern critical audience.
Shakspeare introduced a new form of
dramatic construction into tlie world ; so did
Ibsen. Now both of those forms are out of
date, and the world is obviously ripe to re-
ceive, and is waiting for, some new form.
What will that new form be? Only another
Shakspeare or another Ibsen can answer that
question. All drama grown out of the
earliest saga. Of later years it has branched
out in many directions. It has gone in one
direction as far as grand opera, where
character and action and everything else are
subordinated to the music. Theu in another
direction it has gone as far as plays like
“Cairo” and “Kismet,” where everything is
subordinated to scenic effect. Then there are
melodrama, where character is subordinated
to action, and the problem play, where char-
acter is subordinated to the idea. What we
are waiting for now; is the new form of the
drama, where everything is subordinated to
the revelation of character. That is the great
drama. It was the drama of Shakspeare and
the drama of Ibsen. Whether the new foTm
when it comes will be suitable for stage pre-
sentation, or, as’. Hardy suggests, for mental
performance only, remains to be seen. At
any rate, the time has arrived when the
tliought-play and the action-play, as far as
stage production is concerned, finally diverge;
for the realism that will suffice for the one
will not do at all for the other. And, any
way, the logical ultimate development of
realism is the real, and that is obviously im-
possible of attainment in any art form.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
The King Papers
Like the journal and letters of Daniel
Southwell, Master’s Mate in H.M.S. Sirius,
the literary remains of the late Captain
Philip Gidley King, third Governor of N. S.
Wales, have already been published. They
form one of those records of early Australia
which have an almost equal value with the
volumes of Phillip, Hunter, Collins, Tench
and other officers of the First Fleet, printed
and published in London at the end of the
eighteenth century. His private journals,
still in the possession of his descendants,
have appeared in the same volume of “The
Historical Records of New South Wales”
that contains the Macarthur and the South-
well papers. Like the last-named, however,
they have only for the most part reached
those who have had access to the “Records”
—which, outside public libraries, are every
year becoming more and more difficult for
those interested in early Australia to get
hold of. But they afford such valuable data
in the study of Australian history, and cover
so much time of which there is little other
account, that they are well worth the atten-
tion of readers of this Page. And that not
only because they tell something of a man
who did much in laying the foundations of
the Commonwealth, but also because they
supply a great deal that has miss-
ing” in its earliest story, as told in the
Governors’ despatches. Many of the latter
have been unaccountably lost, and it is
impossible now to say what has become of
them. They should begin in 1788, but do
not do so until 1800. There is no trace
of the despatches sent and received during
the Governorships of Phillip and Hunter, and
the Lieutenant-Governorships of Grose and
Paterson. It is only from such semi-private
records as the King Papers and others that
it has been possible to reconstruct the tale
of our beginnings ; and it is fortunate that
they are fairly abundant and obviously re-
liable.
King came to Australia as Second Lieutenant
of the Sirius, and acted as Commandant at
Norfolk Island from March, 1788, to March,
1790, under a Commission from Phillip as
Governor of N. S. Wales. He was subse-
quently appointed Lieutenant-Governor of
the island, under a Commission from the
Crown, and did duty there from November,
1791, to October, 1796. He followed Captain
Hunter as Governor of N. S. Wales from
1800 to 1806, when he was succeeded by
Captain Bligh. The MSS. which remained
in the possession of his family are exceed-
ingly important, and consist of a Journal, in
two volumes, having to do with the voyage
of the Sirius from England, and of his first
term of office as Commandant at Norfolk
Island; a letter-book, containing copies of
despatches received and sent during both his
terms of office there; four letter-books of
the same kind, covering his term as Gover-
nor of N. S. Wales, from September, 1800,
to August, 1806; and original letters and
despatches from 1799 to 1811.
In a note signed by King, prefixed to the
first volume of the Journal, he, says :
As I wrote this Journal for my own satisfaction
I do beg and request that, into whatever hand it
may fall (in case of any accidents happening to
me), To give or forward it into the hands of His
Excellency Governor Phillip or in case of his demise
to Lieut. William Dawes of the Marines, who I
entreat to destroy it; if any of the materials can
be of service to the latter he is perfectly welcome
to them.
The entries relating to the first foundation
of Norfolk Island as a British settlement
are as interesting and characteristic as any
portion of the Journal. In the “Historical
Records” they have been reprinted exactly
as King wrote them, with all his peculiari-
ties of spelling and composition. He writes
of the fitting out of the expedition in
February, 1788: —
Between ye 7th and 13th my time was wholly
employed in sending the stores, provisions, &c., on
board the Supply, which I was to carry with me to
Norfolk Island, consisting of six months’ provisions
and tools and utensils of all kinds. On ye 13th
I embarked ye officers and people destined to go with
me, who were Mr. James Cunningham, master’s
mate; Mr. Thomas Jamison, surgeon mate; Mr.
Roger Morley, an adventurer, had been a master-
weaver; two marines and one seaman, belonging to
ye Sirius; nine male convicts and six female do.
The vessel, which was commanded by Lieu-
tenant H. L. Ball, R.N., sailed from Port
Jackson on February 15, and arrived off the
island on the 29th. It was not, however,
until March 5, after considerable explora-
tion of the coast and interior, that King
decided on a place where he might make his
settlement. Under that date he writes:—
At daylight we weighed and ran round to ye
bay (Anson’s), when Lieut. Ball and myself went
in a boat, but found ye surf too violent to land. I
now begin to think it was impossible to land on ye
isle, as I have nearly made a circuit of it and
found no place where there is a possibility of
landing; the only prospect remained, which was to
search if a passage could be found through the
reef which runs along Sidney Bay (which is ye name
I give to the Bay on the S-W’t side of ve isle).
We went there, and ye master was sent in ye boat to
examine it, and on his return he informed us that a
landing was very easy, as a small break of ye reef
(large enough to admit two boats) was formed
between two parts of it, and boats might land on
a sandy beach. On his report, Lieut. Ball and
myself went to examine it, and found it just as he
had reported. We landed in a fine sandy bay or
beach without any difficulty whatever. Above this
beach lay a bank, ye edge of which was surrounded
by ye large kind of iris; on piercing thro’ it we
found a fine piece of ground....
March 6th.—At daybreak I left the Supply with
two boats, having in them all ye people belonging
to ye settlement (except ye women), the tents, a
quantity of each kind of provisions, and ye most
usefull tools, which we landed with great ease, and
ye people were instantly set to work clearing away

ground enough to erect the tents on and ye
colours were hoisted. Betore suusett eieiy tnin„ ana
De ,. s on belonging to the settlement were on shore and
the tents pitched before the colours were tauled down.
I assembled all ye settlement and Ball present.
I took possession of ye isle, drink ng His “Meaty,
“The Queen ” “Prince of Wales, Governor 1 hil-
lip” and “Success to ye Colony,” after which three
Cll \fareh 7tb^—lt blew so very hard all day and so
great a surf that no boat could land this day, i
employed the people in clearing away a piece of
ground for sowing some seed.... We soon after our
landing found a very fine spring of fresh waC-i at
about three minutes’ walk from us, ye neighbourhood
of which is very convenient, as it may be made io
overflow a piece of flat ground which is at ,hi lout
of ve hill, and would make a very good lice ground.
The isle is so very thick of wood and underwood
that ni>' progress will be but slow for some time to
come with the few people which I have with me. Jt
is rather extraordinary that we have not, yet found
a single plant of flax, ye ground having ye same
app’e on .ve south side of ye isle that it has on ye
north, with this difference, that it is more accessible
on this side than the other.
Thus was a beginning made by King in
colonising Norfolk Island, lovely and lonely
gem of the South Pacific, on which man had
never before dwelt, and which man was to
turn, before many years had passed by, into
one of the most outrageous Hells that have
ever existed.

I will not waste any space over the bom-
bast at the outset of Mr. Mowbray’s article
(R.P. 30/10/’24). His talk about my “false
assumptions, bad logic, shallow science and
doubtful history” is, to retaliate, just a
vulgar noise. He shows such a muddled
mind on the subject that he must have found
it necessary to hide his confusion in a welter
of words.
He gives his most frantic denial to my
contention that wantonness is instinctive in
all womankind. Every sane person who
read my article knows that I took pains to
point out that this instinct is sub-conscious
in most women, and is only allowed to emerge
when interpreted as “fashion” or in some
such respectable manner. But, consciously
or otherwise, most women do practise the
wiles of the wanton ; and Mr. Mowbray has
produced evidence that I neglected to men-
tion in my article. He states that many of
the most typical fashions of the present day
were pioneered by “fast women, but have
now become respectable. They have become
respectable because our perfectly correct
young women have insisted on following the
example of the other sort. It is notable
that this imitation has been contemporary
with the emancipation of woman, so-called;
indicating that women were modest and
chaste in dress and manner only as long as
men forced them to be so, and that, as soon as
they could do somewhat as they liked, this
deep-rooted instinct asserted itself. What
other explanation is there for the certainty
with which women have mimicked the arts
of the loose-living outcast? We must not
question the virtue of Mr. Mowbray’s women-
folk. Most women are virtuous because it
doesn't pay to be otherwise; but women also
find that it doesn’t pay to be without male
admirers, and their instincts tell them how
to attract. That they succeed proves the
other side of my contention.
Of course the instincts wore formed in
the pre-historic and animal periods, but they
have all been modified in the later and his-
toric period. The instinct of reproduction
originated with life itself; the conscious
search for a life-mate probably came with
savagery 7>r barbarism, and civilisation has
brought further modifications. All of the
instinctive arts by which women seek to
attract are of comparatively recent origin,
and it is certain that the historic period
lias brought many of the present modifica-
tions upon sex. though the instinct itself is
as old as the life of this world. Likewise,
it is certain that there never was a period of
history when the majority of women were
prostitutes in the strict sense of the word;
but there have been long periods when the
status of women was very little different
from that—when, as I have said, they were
sold in marriage to the highest bidder. This
was distinctly mercenary, and there y,et re-
main in Australia thousands of mothers who
have trained their daughters to precisely the
same attitude of mind. There are thousands
of perfectly respectable girls who have been
sedulously trained to sell themselves at a
good price. On the other hand, we know
that there have been periods in the history
of every nation when wantonness, though not
mercenary, was yet the rule rather than
the exception. The truth is that modern
society has a very questionable past, and
if we are to understand ourselves and make
our future admirable we will have to recog-
nise what our past has been. Mr. Mowbray’s
confused denials will only make for a ehaotic
future.
It is a pity that this babbler has challenged
my knowledge of the subject, for he has
forced me to state the facts. If I know my
subject, he claims, I will know that none
outside the wealthy classes are able fre-
quently to resort to “women of that sort.”
Well, I know my subject: that is, I know
the habits of the toilers of this and other
countries. I have been a toiler amongst
them—have worked as a seaman on the ships
that call at our ports, as a prospector in one
of our mining camps, as a navvy in the west
of Queensland, as a laborer in city factories,
as a waiter in a big Svdney restaurant, and
in many other capacities. And I know that
of all the men who work with their hands
there are very few who do not frequently
resort to such women. Young and old,
married and single, this is true; though it is
naturally more widely true of the young
unmarried men. Mr. Mowbray’s statement,
that only the wealthy can afford such
“luxuries,” is the silliest in his whole
muddled article. These men do not consider
this a luxury. They consider marriage a
luxury, and the married ones consider child-
ren an added luxury. Very often they go
to the prostitute as a chean substitute for
either or both of these luxuries. This is an
ugly, distasteful and disgusting fact; but it
is fact. My critic knows very little of his
subject, or he would not have called forth the
statement of this fact. Or if he does know
it, then he has joined in the general hypocrisy
of the mob in uttering a sneak’s lie.
That sneak’s lie is behind man’s attempt
to keep woman on a pedestal above him.
This pedestal of “sanctity” is mans excuse
for not being frank with woman on this
subject. It is thus man strives to lade from
her his own shame. My article struck at the
verv base of that artificial pedestal, and the
frenzy of anger shown by men who strive
to defend “the sanctity of womanhood, or
whatever they call their hypocrisy; is really
a frenzy of fear lest they be found out. Mi.
Mowbray must not take this statement as
personal. He is probably as chaste as 1
myself, but through his article speaks the
chagrin of tl.e leering mob.
LESTER WAY.
A Lesson in Public Education
Among the little countries of Europe none
has done more wonderful things m the
last half-century than Denmark. Land
which had been almost useless since the
Glacial Period was brought into close culti-
vation • people who had been half-starved
clods on a hungry soil became prosperous
and cultured: the whole place woke up to
discover that making the best, of its own
resources was the road to national wealth.
The author of the change was Bishop Grunt-
vig; and liis ideas, which gave the best
modern results, were direct and old-fashioned.
Germany was establishing trade schools and
stressing technical education; but Gruntvig
decided that what the Danes needed was
“not technical training, but mental. Ilie
results were wonderful. Education came to
the country like a great wave of romance;
from every one of the new High Schools
poured not merely a flood of light but a flood
of color and of joy. Without leaving tlieir
accustomed occupations in many cases, the
former clod-like peasantry saw new horizons
broadening around them ; their world became
larger, their hopes higher, the whole business
of living was changed. Technical knowledge
followed as naturally as noon follows dawn;
the country which had begun to live intellec-
tually began to hold its own in every prac-
tical department of life.
Some curious social results were produced.
W. B. Yeats told recently of one of these.
Dining with a prominent professor in Den-
mark, you are apt to find your own house-
maid sitting next to yon at the table, and
to discover that she is an advanced scholar
and one of the professor’s favorite pupils.
Next morning she will be a very good house-
maid again—far too well educated to be
“above” her duties or to think less of the
means by which she earns her bread. I
will confess that such is an extreme case;
but the fact remains—Denmark seeking edu-
cation for its own sake has opened the door
for its people to everything else. Examina-
tions have been reduced to the minimum; and
“getting on” is the very last thing of which
either teacher or pupil thinks. No one can
doubt from the results that the principle is
sound. The so-called education which aims
at preparing a boy or girl for a certain occu-
pation—which means, in bare fact, preparing
the boy or girl for a certain salary—is de-
grading rather than elevating. Professional
experts are often utterly uneducated; they
walk blind and deaf to all the bigger things
of existence. The surgeon who cuts a man’s
heart in halves and deftly sews it up again
is a perfect craftsman; but his intellectual
level on all matters not connected with sur-
gery may be —and sometimes is—that of the
navvy or rabbit-catcher rather than of the
educated man. Yet who doubts that the
surgeon, whatever his mechanical skill, would
be a better surgeon if he possessed wider
interests and a larger outlook?
Education in Australia is too much com-
mercialised. Each examination is looked upon
as having a cash value to the person passing
it. Though starting with the natural advant-
ages of quick mind and good health, the aver-
age mental achievements of State-taught Aus-
tralians are not high. We have the wrong
end of the stick; the Danes have the right
erne.
C. O. M.
Epicurus
Misrepresentation for misrepresentation,
I know of none worse than that which
stares me in the face from “C. McL.’s” essay
(R.P. 6/11/’24) and purports to come from
the late Anatole France; misrepresentation
for representation, I know of none worse than
any that would, at this time of day, palm
off on us a long-exposed charlatan.
Epicurus was neither scholar nor man of
culture. If a Christian were to say “Blessed
am I that I have not known letters because
I shall enter into the kingdom of God,” with
what self-complacent and self-satisfied smile
would not our neo-Epicureans regard him?
And yet it was Epicurus who praised his
disciples for coming to him unsophisticated
by the siren Culture —nay, enjoined on them
to “crowd on all sail and flee her.” He
was no writer. His language is as clotted
and uningurgitable as his thought—among
all Greek philosophers he least deserves the
name of artist. And if his blessed gods, as
he held, spoke in Greek and that Greek was
like his, then alack and welladay for Heaven !
And least of all thinker. For if there is in
his whole system one original idea, it is that
which ruins the whole (which is. anyhow,
a ramshackle shanty made up of borrowed
or stolen material) and betrays the quack.
Atomism was the teaching of Demokritos
and of his teacher Leukippos (whose exist-
ence Epicurus denied —but we have learned to
trust Epicurus as much as we trust Heinrich
Heine) ; but they held that if atoms and
the void are the only reality, then sensation,
which perceives only their qualities, cannot
be the criterion of reality. Epicurus had not
enough—let us call it politely, with -Prof.
Taylor, “intellectual thoroughness,” to avoid
combining the discrepant theories of materi-
alistic atomism and sensationalism.
We owe the Greeks all discipline; poetry,
art. music, thought, sciences. Science is not
a circus-show, nor a museum, nor a corpora-
tion. nor a clique; it is a spirit, and that
spirit is Greek. Above “professions,” and
above “modern worlds,” self-called “scien-
tific” —and indeed above “humanity”—she
passes ; nothing more than a virginal strict-
ness and determined honesty of thought;
and then, necessarily, the beauty of pure
thought, the “method,” which is at once a
virtue and a delight. Of this Epicurus knew
nothing and refused to know aught; he was
the first to refuse pure knowledge, the first
to lay down dogmas and excommunicate.
He had the unmerited good fortune to be
glorified by a mighty poet; and Lucretius
sacrificed half of his chances by choice of a
most uninspiring theme. As for the rest of
his literary offspring, are they not all of
the tribe of Lucian? Voltaire, Anatole
France and company—their “banter” is not
the meat on which the mind of man must
feed. It is pabulum for the dilettante, just
as the philosophy which “consoles” was
made for the type of mind that wants con-
solation, the spiritual invalid.
CHRIS BRENNAN.
S. P. B. Mais
With 19 volumes of fiction and critical
essays to his credit, S. P. B. Mais is at last
enjoying literary prosperity. If dogged per-
severance ever deserved success then he has
a title to his. His father was a parson, whose
purse was not over-fat, so that the son be-
came a schoolmaster —not from choice, I
fancy. Followed a number of years at a
famous English public school, where he
forced grammar down the throats of unwill-
ing schoolboys. Now he is in his element,
thrusting opinions and ethics down the
throats of his audiences. He is the Arro-
gant Critic. But his arrogance is so subtle
that it becomes extraordinarily clever. 1
imagine him, when the desire to write first
stirred in him, strutting up and down the
masters’ common-room, pompously telling his
fellows what a genius he was —and convinc-
ing them. That is where Mais is so clever.
He can be arrogant, yet plausible and meek.
He can be egotistical, yet convince you that
his egotism has a solid foundation. In many
ways he is the reincarnation of Dr. Johnson.
Unlike his scholastic contemporaries, lan
Hay and Hugh Walpole, he did not reach suc-
cess quickly. He passed through very lean
years before he captured the audience of
readers who like their literary opinions
formed for them by somebody else. His out-
put of novels was steady, but he was lost
amongst a host of lesser writers. But that
did not deter him. Pie continued to write
with assurance, confident that the day
would come when his worth would be
recognised. That self-confidence has been
justified ; he has “arrived.” But it is to his
critical essays rather'than to his novels that
he owes his, success. As a novelist he has
failed, and that the failure has hurt him can
be gathered from a sentence in the preface to
“Some Modern Authors”: “As a novelist I
have with some difficulty created a technique
of my own which only about two critics have
had the ability to discover. My true busi-
ness in life is creative.” There is audaci-
ous courage in that first sentence. But per-
haps more, than that-—I think it is also the
reproof of a writer who honestly believes
that he has been misjudged. The all-powerful
public has, however, decided against his
novels, and taken him to heart for his literary
criticisms. lie has become “fashionable.”
He is read by people who pose as intellec-
tuals. He is shrewd enough tcf understand
his public, and he gives it precisely what
it wants. He will tell you that it is not
his business to “discover” unknown writers.
He shelters no lame literary dogs under his
wing.
In the preface to “Some Modern Authors”
he gi\es up being arrogant and takes two
pages to explain what a bad critic he is. "I
realise that criticism is as much an art as
painting. I wish I could acquire it.” But
we can dismiss that as a sop to the arro-
gance in the issuing pages. He is a good
critic and lie knows it. He is honest; he
says (one feels sure) what lie thinks; and
he nearly always has us in sympathy with
his remarks —for a time perhaps the sym-
pathy would remain with us if only hi' did
not become the overbearing schoolmaster
again. He is subtle and witty. He has a
sense of humor and a great human under-
standing. Add to this his command of Eng-
lish. and one wonders just why he failed as
a novelist. He assures us that “If Winter
Comes” was a bad novel. He is convinced
that Galsworthy’s “Loyalties” was a worse
play. And in “From Shakspearc to O. Henry ’
he has a few bad words to say against Shak-
speare himself. When a man has the courage
to criticise a “best seller,” the most success-
ful play of the year and Shakspeare, he is
worth reading, if only to satisfy one’s curio-
sity.
Of his manner, his vignette of Somerset
Maugham will serve as well as any other
example :
Maugham is of all living writers the most sensitive,
the most easily perturbed by the ruthlessness of the
world. Having discarded the useful cloak of senti-
mentalism which we, more blunted and coarse than
he is, keep on in all weathers, he stands shivering in
the cold, burnt up in the heat. He is like a mediaeval
saint or a modern Brahmin ; he likes to submit
himself to as many bufferings as possible; he suffers
incredibly in stripping off the lendings of illusion-—*
and we gain through his suffering.
It is rather a pity that Mais has become
“fashionable.” It may prove his downfall.
Just at present he is the most refreshing
of modern critics in spite of his arrogance.

A Satchel of Books
Don’ts for Choirmasters, by John Newton (Hoffer
and Sons). The advice in this useful little book is
general rather than technical, and much of it can be
appreciated by the layman.
The English Novel of To-day, by Gerald Gould
(John Castle). Over 20,000 novels have been pub-
lished in Britain since 1900. From the army of
authors responsible for this literary deluge, the
gracefully witty critic of the New Statesman
selects about a hundred as worthy of mention. Many
of the names are unfamiliar, but Gould is a piquant
guide and makes one want to read them all. Some
of the finest are by women. Katherine Mansfield,
the Maoriland girl who died recently, despite her
short life and small output he regards as one of the
greatest, of this century’s novelists —the Chatterton
of fiction.
Me an’ th’ Son, by Steele Rudd (N.S.W. Bookstall
Co.). This collection of sketches will be welcomed
by that large section of readers who have found
delight for the past 20 years in the author’s “Selee-
ticn” novels. It is rarely the literary prospector
strikes a vein of humor that will not run out in
such a tale of years; but Mr. Davis brings to-day
almost as many pennyweights to the dish as he did
when first he panned out “Our Selection.” The man
who can’t get a laugh out of “Me an’ th’ Son” must
have lapsed into melancholia.

DIVIDENDS
IN
CEMENT
The Standard Portland Cement Company, Limited, is being floated to
supply the enormous and ever-increasing demand for Portland Cement. Eoads,
bridges, railway and water construction works are all crying out for this
product. From 1900 until the present day the amount invested in the cement
industry in IST.S.W. has grown from a few thousands to between two and
three millions.
This is the cement age, and investment in this Company offers the biggest
money-making opportunity of the decade.
A SOUND, SAFE INVESTMENT THAT
SHOULD DOUBLE YOUR CAPITAL
IN FOUR TO FIVE YEARS.
This definite statement is backed by the following facts, each of which
will bear, and is worthy of, the closest investigation.
The Government of N.S.W. has, by a contract recently ratified by a
special Act of Parliament, ordered from the Company 150,000 tons of Cement.
The Company possesses limestone—shale —coal —grouped together-
quality undoubted —quantity unlimited —hundreds of years’ supply —ample
water supplies.
Works site intersected by main railway line. Preparation for establish-
ment are already very far advanced.
Construction being supervised by Mr. F. Oakden, C.E., M.I.E. (Aus.),
designer and erector of Kandos Cement Works. Efficient management is
assured.
No Waiting for Dividends
Added to the above the Township Subdivisions at a conservative estimate
show sufficient funds for the pavment of dividends BEFORE PRODUCTION
OF CEMENT.
Shares are being called up on easy terms —2/6 on application, 2/6 on
allotment and 2/6 each quarter for eighteen months. Cement will be
produced in about eighteen months’ time, therefore your shares will just be
fully paid when profits accrue from cement manufacture.
Estimated return on £425,000 capital is 18.52 per cent, on production
of 80,000 tons per annum —with 100,000 tons production 24.64 per cent.
The capital mentioned provides for the latter installation. These are conserva-
tive figures.
An investment such as this in a sound, industrial work of national
importance is seldom available, and should instantly appeal to every class of
investor who desires a safe and generous return for his money.
CLOSING DATE
On or before December 15? 1924*
Shares will be allotted strictly in order applied for, subject
to right of Directors to reject or reduce any application.
Do not delay your application—shares will be allotted strictly in order
pplied for, and immediate action is advised.

Gifts.
Day after day I put away the things
That are my bread and meat —imaginings
Of fairer worlds, stars, dreams and new
strange flowers- —
And walk, still hungry, through the lean,
brown hours.
Night after night I am too tired to drink
The red, rich wine of visions from the brink
Of Heaven itself that sometimes swoops on
me.
I thirst for water on a calm, salt sea!
Y'et know I such a happiness, such grief,
Such mystic promise of the turning leaf.
I sleep as one heavy with too much bread ;
I wake as wake in Heaven the
dead.

After Storm.
Rain-washed are all the streets and lanes
Down-straying to the sea;
Bright shine the hillside window-panes,
The roofs gleam silverly.
Scents reft from violet and rose
Make sweet the velvet wind;
Seaward and south the storm-wrack goes,
A trail of cloud behind.
Clean, stainless, cloudless, overhead
The sunset sky looks down
Upon the scattered roofs of red
That mark the seaside town.
On rain-wet cliff and beach and tree
The golden light glows warm;
A steamer’s smoke far out at sea
Shows black against the storm.
Sails drenched, from fishing-grounds afar
Boats slowly shoreward creep ;
The snoring waves o’er beach and bar
With foam and spindrift sweep.
The sunset dies, and dies the wind,
And quiet night steals down,
Starlit and beautiful and kind,
Upon the seaside town.

Illusion.
There are songs that die in the singing
Of their own desire;
Die on the heart like the ringing
Of bells of fire—
And all that the heart remembers,
All it can hold,
Is the silent and ashen embers
Of their singing gold.
There are dreams that die in the dreaming
Of their own despair
Which mocks at the beryl gleaming
Of a world found fair;
That leave but a haunting shadow
Of a nameless pain
Which yearns for the Eldorado
They sought in vain.
There are lamps of Illusion burning
That smoulder low,
There are faiths that life’s wheel, turning,
Must overthrow;
Yet love laughs up from the embers
Of a dead song’s fire
Till all that the heart remembers
Is a dream’s desire!

Friends.
Now will you walk abroad with me,
And meet my friend, the willow-tree?
Above the river’s rippled face
She bends to watch her slender grace
Reflected in the water’s gleam ;
And when beneath her arms I dream
Always my friend, the willow-trfee,
Will speak her tender sympathy.
Down by the bleak, gale-beaten shore
There stands a spreading sycamore.
When wfild winds sweep.the chill, grey slope
The sycamore, that tree of hope,
Stands battling with the storm ; and yet
Each twig with tender buds is set.
With zest that, leaves me wondering
Each harried bough is sweet with Spring.
Deep, sheltered in the ferny glade,
Eair as a lissom, lovely maid,
Slender and lightsome as a fay,
The silver birch has arms to sway.
All, • oftentimes I think sbe knows
There is no fairer thing that grows
Within the grove! Why ask of her
More than her beauty may confer?
In what brief words can I acclaim
This tree of great and age-old fame?
Its spread boughs ever give to me
A message of fidelity,
Of strength and power in peace or stress,
Blent with a splendid steadfastness;
And in humility I pass
The oak’s deep shadow on the grass.
Of all my trees I would confess
I love tlie elm for friendliness.
Oft in the night-time I have lain
While a soft sound like summer rain,
A gentle, kindly, rustling note.
Would through the lonely darkness float,
To say my friend the old elm-tree
Was speaking through the dark to me.
So walk abroad with me to-day
And meet my friends along the way—
Beeches and dark, courageous pines
Ponlars serene in silent lines,
A laurel, known for constancy—
In sooth a noble company.
I could not part with one of these
My gracious friends, the woodland trees.

TWO KNIGHTS AND SOME
RAILWAYS.
The two belted knights who were imported
to comment on the railways of N. S. Wales
have duly commented on such points as were
referred to them, and it would have been
heterodox to do more. On the whole they
appear to have done not badly, though their
report contains no bursts of original thought
or research. They mention, for instance, that
too many varieties of locomotives and too
many ancient locomotives constitute bad
policy, and that it is an unsatisfactory
arrangement by which the new financial year
is getting pretty old before the Commission-
ers know exactly what they have to spend;
and even local people and departments re-
marked that it is lazy and foolish to pass
a law about the month of November autho-
rising a department to spend something in
July or August, especially if the something
is already spent. The report suggests decen-
tralisation of control, and the Government
has taken up the idea in the sense that it
is prepared to appoint some new nominal
managers and station them at different places
while keeping the real control still central-
ised at the old address. And among sundries
too numerous to mention the visitors urged:
That the railways be so worked and managed that
the gross receipts shall not be more than sufficient
to cover working expenses, reserves and interest on
capital, including sinking funds. That in event of
a surplus it be devoted to reduction of rates and
fares. If, on the other hand, a loss appears, that
rates and fares be increased to cover the deficit.
These propositions will probably be accepted
in the sense that the gross receipts will not
be more than sufficient for the purposes
named. The chances are, indeed, that they
will be so much less that there will be no
sinking fund except the old bad joke, amount-
ing to about 4d. in the £ of debt, which was
smaller in 1923 than in 1911, because some-
body had been getting away with money in
the interval. The hatred which Ma State
Governments have for making any provision
against the day of repayment amounts to
mania or even hydrophobia. And there is an
equal dislike to provide against depreciation
as it goes along. It is simpler to let an
article which cost £lOOO of loan money re-
main nominally worth £lOOO till it is worth
nothing. Then it can be replaced out of
revenue, or out of more loans, or out of
some old thing. Two knights with more local
experience might have written “shall be suffi-
cient” instead of “shall not be more than
sufficient.” It would have made no differ-
ence, but they would have gained a name for
prevision. As it is they only gave warning
against the last thing that is likely to happen.
* * * *
Another Commission, with a wider scope
and a different set of instructions, might now
be engaged to take up the parable where the
recent pair left off. There are many points
on which an expert opinion would be inter-
esting, and might be valuable. It might even
be libellous. One is the reason for, and the
advisability of, dragging all the trade of a
vast area to one port regardless of distances
—except, of course, the coal trade, which
Avas permitted an. outlet at Newcastle in days
when the bridging of the Hawkesbury was
undreamt of. The refusal to connect other
deep-water harbors with their interior, and
the stoppage of dead-end, money-losing lines
within a few miles of such outlets as Jervis
Bay and Twofold Bay, which are thus left
idle and ucsless, may be good policy. If
so it would be well to have it explained why
other nations have so unanimously failed to
see the advantages of the one-port policy.
It almost seems that missionaries should be
sent to them. This branches into a second
question. Seeing that the ostensible aim of
all local politics, especially loan politics, is
the settlement and development of the coun-
try, and seeing that this country has its own
exclusive way of settling, it would be no bad
thing for the new Commission to put all the
politicians it can catch in the box, and ask
them why N. S. Wales, outside the County
of Cumberland, has ceased to settle worth a
copper. The fact that foreign States which
lack the one-big-city and the one-port and
the big-settlement loan policy do get a dif-
fused population, and have new industrial
towns rising to prosperity, is as plain as
that N. S. Wales doesn’t and hasn’t. Evi-
dence might be called to the extent of a few
thousand pages in another direction. There
is a monotonous habit of rejecting every pro-
posal for a line from inland to a new port,
where a new city might arise, the explana-
tion being that there is no positive evidence
that said line will pay (though a new port
seems worth gambling a trifle on), or that
it is an extension of an existing work which
doesn’t pay. Yet the question of payableness
doesn’t enter into the case when it is a
matter of building a stump railway which
must send its scrap of commerce to Sydney
because it leads to nowhere—not even to a
hope or a prospect or a dim future. Thus
it was decided the other day, as a matter
of course, to extend the Henty-Rand section,
which loses close on £4OO per mile per
annum, and which is one of a group of hope-
lessly non-paying stump railways that make
the map thereabouts appear as if it was a
sketch of a cactus. The frequent reason
assigned for turning down a certain class of
proposed works being so obviously a lie, the
next Commission should inquire into the
cause of the lie, and whether there is any
profit to anybody in it, and how the profit
accrues.
* * * *
Prime Minister Bruce recently told an
audience that “there is no more inefficient
means of tackling developmental problems
than to leave them to a Government.” He
might have added “especially to a hard-bor-
rowing Government, presiding over a people
made flabby by loans.” His vieiv was that
affairs would go much better under “a dic-
tatorship consisting of the best brains, un-
trammelled and uncontrolled, which would
work for the good of the people as a whole.”
The idea is fascinating; but difficulties have
to be considered —three in particular:—
If the proposed brains were selected as the present
ones are, especially on the Labor side of the House,
they would very likely be the same brains, but
intoxicated with more authority, or the appearance of
it, and with better chances of robbery.
It is difficult to see liow they could be really “un-
trammelled and uncontrolled.” The people who
made them might unmake them.
A genuine dictatorship is only possible when the
dictators seize on power and appoint themselves.
Very often the best brains don’t care for such ad-
ventures. Napoleon I. arrived that way, and though
he was, in some respects, an intelligence in ten mil-
lions, he proved a costly experiment. Trotsky and
his pals came the same way, and the Trotsky kind
is more common than the Napoleon species. If a
chance turns up for an “untrammelled and uncon-
trolled” duumvirate attained in the only possible way,
it is probable that Tom Walsh and Garden would
have the best chances. They are certainly candidates.
Circumstances appear to disqualify Bruce’s
Utopia. The position is that government
has become the running of a complicated
series of business enterprises, and the man-
agement lias drifted largely into the hands
of trade-union secretaries, decayed house-
agents—some of them drinkers —and persons
lacking in “lawful visible.” They are chosen
by secret processes. According to an excep-
tional member of the Labor party—excep-
tional because he is in neither of the above
categories—the wrong men have been get-
ting in by the worst secret-ballot frauds for
30 years. Real development of the country
has practically ceased, though the spending
of loan money in the name of development
goes on magnificently. The explanation is
that the really undeveloped places, where
pioneering is called for, haven’t enough ready-
made votes to be worth an “uncouth crook’s”
while. It is quite possible that Australia
will find some day, to its surprise, that it
has gone back to Private Enterprise and
land-grant railway-building. Private Enter-
prise has a liking for empty and reasonably
fertile places, where it can get in cheaply
and hope for a harvest. It has no objection
to new ports and cities, but rather desires
them with a great craving, with a hope to do
the carrying for them. It doesn’t care if
there are few voters where it builds, so long
as it believes there will be plenty later on.
The Private Enterprise builder tries to secure
profits for the shareholders, that being his
business. The average Political Enterprise
builder has no reason to care whether his
fine costs the shareholders all the interest
and half the working expenses so long as
it brings him political support. Political
Enterprise was respectable once, like the
lady who is accumulating a past; but,
having taken to drink and piled up a dread-
ful list of convictions, it is held in small
esteem nowadays.
POTATOES AND OTHER PANACEAS.
An Oriental philosopher, who should know
liis own people, has laid down rules for the
right control of Asiatics. “The sage, when
he governs,” he says, “empties the people s
minds and fills their bellies, weakens their
inclinations and strengthens their bones. His
constant object is to keep them without
knowledge and without desire, or to prevent
those who have knowledge from daring to act.
He practises inaction, and nothing remains
ungoverned.” That Britain has offended
against some of the axioms of this didactic
old gentleman, who lived about 15 centuries
ago, but whose information is right up-to-
date, and that others have been submerged by
the rush of inevitable circumstance, can be
easily demonstrated. As to the first, it is a
well-known fact that the ranks of the Indian
extremists are almost entirely recruited from
the students turned out by the colleges and
universities, whose Western learning is of
little use to them in Indian society, but re-
mains a dangerous ferment in tlieir minds.
The Government’s own statistics disclose the
extreme emptiness of the national stomach.
The annual income of India’s 320 millions is
less than £6 per head; England’s average
was £230 before the war. The daily wage
of men in Bombay is less than 2s. Od.; 72
per cent, of this is spent on food and rent
and 10 per cent, on clothing, leaving 18 per
cent, for other needs; and the average dietary
of the adult male is less than that provided
for prisoners in gaol. Single rooms house
97 per cent, of the working-class families in
Bombay, and rooms containing 10 or more
persons shelter 13.7 per cent. Of every
thousand babies born into the environment
that these figures reveal no less than 828.5
are lucky enough to die in infancy: Aus-
tralia’s rate for 1921 was 65. In the coun-
try conditions are no better. The wage of
an agricultural worker in 1900 was about
threepence a day. It has risen since, but
the cost of living has risen faster, so that
what may be called the effective wage is 6
per cent, lower to-day than it was in 1914.
* * * *
Of the remainder of the Oriental wise-
acre’s prescription, the foreign Government
does not seem to have taken much notice.
It seems to be an established fact that,
although in a rough and ready way ■> demo-
cracy does succeed in governing itself, it is
quite incapable of governing a subject race
with satisfaction to itself and to the content-
ment of the subjects. A continuous series
of concessions, usually belated, to Indian
demands lias only resulted in the creation of
an insatiable appetite for more; the spas-
modic reversion to autocratic methods has
merely had the effect of adding a large army
of martyrs to the cause of Indian nationalism
and of alienating most of those races that
were once friendly to the British rule. The
Sikhs, for instance, were at one time fana-
tically devoted to the Crown: their district
is now one of the most dangerous centres
of political unrest. Indian nationalism is
no longer afraid to act: it is only divided
on the question of what form the death-
knock shall take. Some advocate the blud-
geon and the bomb; some the economic
weapon. Others pin their faith to non-
co-operation, and these last, if they could
establish unify of action, could probably
compel the English alien to walk out of
India to-morrow by means of a national
strike of punkah-wallahs, cocktail mixers,
factory employees and all the horde of native
helpers wdiose service sustains the imposing
but shaky-footed fabric of foreign domination.
But the ingredient of the Asiatic recipe for
the government of Asiatics which the British
rulers of India have consistently omitted
is that which the sage aforementioned refers
to as “inaction.” Inaction is the active prin-
ciple of all native rulers. Doing nothing
appeals to their temperaments, satisfies their
subjects, and achieves as good results in a
thousand years as a legislative bill every
five minutes. But doing nothing is anathema
to Western minds; consequently the British
Government, helped by humanitarians, has
busied itself in suppressing suttee, whereby
superfluous widows were eliminated ; promot-
ing irrigation, whereby extra mouths were
created; abolishing famine, floods, pestilence,
child-murder, tliugism and the marriage of
infants, whereby the population was kept with-
in reasonable limits: and ameliorating the
rigidness of caste, whereby the divisions of
Indian society were prevented from uniting.
* * * *
Australians cannot logically refuse a cer-
tain amount of admiration for the picturesque
Gandiii, whose Protectionist proposals for
his over-populated country include the com-
plete exclusion of foreign cloth; but his Uto-
pian scheme of reverting to hand-spun khad-
dar instead of hoisting the British with their
own petard by importing machinery to man
Indian factories stamps him as an impractic-
able idealist; and that, in fact, is the ver-
dict of the Indians themselves who have left
him fasting by the wayside and have gone
off after other gods called Das and Nehru.
These gentlemen propose to make India’s
modest beginnings in representative govern-
ment unworkable by getting themselves and
their friends elected in a constitutional way
to the various assemblies and then blocking
every measure that is brought up for con-
sideration. A constant feature in the flux
and reflux of human politics is the pheno-
menon of the extremist of one period becom-
ing the pillar of orthodoxy in the next;
events in a country with such urgent pro-
blems as India do not stand still, and doubt-
less the British Government will shortly
be hailing Gandiii as a sound Imperialist
and adopting his revolutionary proposals as
bulwarks of defence against worse tilings to
follow. But neither Das nor Gandiii. nor
any other of their loinclothed or frock-coated
brethren, has shown the faintest glimmering
of a conception of the real origin of India’s
troubles. Somebody has suggested the potato
as a panacea. This is as good as and no better
than all the others, and illustrates how com-
pletely the root cause is ignored. The pro-
tagonists of the potato scheme maintain that
the introduction of the unfamiliar tuber
would enormously increase the productivity
of Indian fields, at present devoted to the
cultivation of unsustaining rice. But they
leave out of account the fecundity of the
Indian mother, who would immediately re-
spond to the plenitude of spud by producing
an increased number of offspring to eat it up.

In any case, the member of Baldwin’s
new Cabinet least likely to be envied is Lord
Birkenhead, the new Secretary for India.
The problems of the distressful country of
which he will have the business direction
appear to be rapidly approaching the condi-
tion where they are insoluble in water and
liable to be exacerbated by fire; and the ex-
galloping major who helped to foster Ulster’s
right to self-determination in pre-war days,
and Avho recently earned much liberal criti-
cism for a rectorial address advocating the
right of might to rule, will have an opportu-
nity of testing both theories. It may be
safely predicted that when an irresistible
force meets an immovable object the result
will be considerable heat.
QUEENSLAND POLICY AND
ACHIEVEMENT.
Randolph Bedford, M.L.A., writes:—
A “Plain English” article (B. 23/'lO/’24) dealing
with Queensland’s losses on railways, Chillagoe
smelters and State coal-mines, and the included wail
concerning Queensland’s backwardness as a manu-
facturing- State, is so exaggerated as to have little
resemblance to truth.
In estimating the cost of railway management the
size of the State must be taken into consideration.
In Queensland 41.8 p.c. of the lines are outside, a
500-mile radius from the metropolis. In other States
these percentages are: N. S. Wales, 2.6 p.c. ; West-
ralia, 7.5 lie.;' Victoria and S.A., nil. Working
expenses per train mile are lower in Queensland than
in any other State. The figures are: Queensland,
Bs. 3fd. ; N. S. AVales, 9s. 2ld. ; S.A., 9s. sd. ; West-
ralia, 9s. 6d. ; Vic., 10s. 5 Jd. The railway deficits
could be wiped out in two years by increasing fares
and freights, as they were increased in the other
States by Tory Governments. In N. S. Wales these
increases during the past nine years were 66 p.c.;
in Victoria, 48 p.c. ; in Queensland, 25.7 p.c. The
policy of the Queensland Labor Government is to
keep down freights, and so stimulate production.
“Port rates” are fixed in the various States. The
rates per ton per 100 miles are: Queensland, 12s.
lid.; Vic., 215.; S.A., 215.; Westralia, 225. 4d.;
N. S. AVales, 245. lOd.
The statement that the four State coal-mines made
losses is untrue. The Bowen mine showed a profit
on the year’s working ; in addition, the Railway De-
partment advises that the saving through the pur-
chase of coal from this mine instead of from pri-
vate owners up till the end of September, 1921,
amounted to £90,000. The price previously paid
private owners was 425. 3d. per ton; the present
price is 18s. 3d. p.t. Hence the squeal. Though the
Baralaba mine showed a loss of £4400 for the year,
the Railway Department saved £40,000 during the
same period by the purchase of cheaper coal there-
from.
As to cotton, the assertion is made that “the Gov-
ernment lent the usual kindly interference, and some
£243,000 of public money appears to be already
gone.” Appearances are deceitful. This money—it
was advanced to growers—averaged 5.47 d. per lb.
of seed cotton. The Auditor-General states that “the
total lint production was 3,606,9291 b., of which
3,303,8711 b. sold overseas and 303,0581 b. sold locally
realised £255,708 9s. lOd. and £23,387 13s. sd.
respectively” ; so the security is fairly good. Any-
way, “kindly interference” by somebody was about
due. The Official Year Book gives the figures for
1919 as: Cotton area planted. 72 acres; unginned
cotton produced, 27,0001 b. Following the Govern-
ment’s interference the result in 1923 was: Area
harvested, 35,000 acres; unginned cotton produced,
12,000,0001 b.
Apart from the fact that they do not agree with
those • furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician,
The Bulletin writer’s long list of figures re the
number of persons employed in Queensland factories
does not prove very much. Taking factories employ-
ing over 100 persons, the increase in Queensland dur-
ing the past five years was 13, in AVestralia 12, in
S.A. 9, and in Tasmania, after long years of
Tory rule, 2. During the same period the value
of Queensland’s factory output increased by
£10,000,000, as against £4,000,000 in S.A. and
AVestralia, and one-tenth of a million in the Speck.
The value of output per employee for the last year
recorded was: Queensland, £955; N. S. Wales, £892;
S.A., £765 ; Vic., £733; Westralia, £623; Tas.,
£572 —average, £BIO. The value added in process
of manufacture per employee was also higher in
Queensland than in any other State.
“Somebody robbed the Golden Casket.” Somebody
also robbed the Bank of England many years ago,
and an armed guard in the old uniform still pro-
tects the building every night. It evidently expects
to be robbed again. However, if only 10s. 51d. out
of every pound is returned to ticket-holders, £162,000
went to charitable institutions last year. It would
be quite easy to abolish the Golden Casket and starve
the hospitals. In 1914 the Nationalists spent
£321,000 on hospitals and charitable institutions;
in 1921 the Labor Government spent £1,017,817.
The expenditure on education, science and art
amounted to 21s. 6d. per head in 1914, and to 355.
sd. in 1922. The cost of maintenance per head ot
average attendance in State schools Was £5 in 1914,
and £lO in 1921. In 1914 the average weekly
wage was 525.; in 1924 it was 945.
And the eritic replies:—
The foregoing proves merely that Mr. Bedford
believes what he wants to believe ns regards his
party, and vice versa. His attempt to account for
the huge annual railway deficit is pathetic. The
argument as to area is answered by the fact that
AVestralia, with 305,420 sq. miles more than Queens-
land’s 670,500 and the same gauge (3ft. 6in.),
showed a profit of £142,170 last year, whereas
Queensland reported a loss of £1,593,066. Nor is
remoteness from the metropolis a handicap, seeing
that the Queensland railways, as a general rule,
are built to the natural port; in this respect, indeed.
Queensland has an advantage over AVestralia and
other States whose excessively centralised systems
involve unnecessary haulage, much of it unprofitable.
Neither are bedrock fares and goods rates the solu-
tion of the mystery. The theory was recently
advanced by Larcombe, the Queensland Minister of
Railways, but a return published at the beginning of


the month by Pope, the Westralian Commissioner,
makes it look foolish. A comparison of goods rates
works out as follows: —
Mileage. Commodity. W.A. Queensland.

In the last pre-Labor year (1914-15) the Queensland
railways returned a profit of £48,651. During the
nine Labor j'ears there has been a deficit of
£11,426,899. To provide for this £11,426,899, and
for the annual addition to the interest bill
■ (£1,975,581 when Mr. Bedford’s, party took office;
£3,897,747 last year), the wage-paying section
of the Queensland public has been taxed
up to the eyes. Hence the shabby business of running
lotteries to gather funds for hospitals and charities —-
funds which in well-governed countries are raised
by taxation; hence also the fact, recorded in the
latest Commonwealth Year Book, that only 100
new factories were started in Queensland between
1918-19 and 1922-23, whereas 296 arrived in S.A.
—a State with 300,000 fewer people and vastly inferior
resources—43s in Westralia, 136 in Tasmania, 1376
in Victoria, and 1242 in N. S. Wales. Mr. Bedford’s
figures as to factories are misleading; in fact, worth-
less.
Whether the cotton-grower wouldn’t have got along
better without Ministerial meddling is matter for
argument; certainly the industry was injured, and
was in danger of being destroyed, by the Govern-
ment’s stupid ban on ratoon cotton, now withdrawn.
At all events, in quoting from the Auditor-General's
references to the cotton trading transactions, Mr.
Bedford omitted to mention that “a loss of
£40,389 15s. lOd. resulted, which will be borne
equally by the Commonwealth and State Govern-
ments,” and that “the total losses incurred under
the Government guarantee are £68,930 ss. 4d.” He
also neglected to state that there was a loss last
year of £4886 on the Baralaba coal-mine, of
£14,384 on Styx No. 2, of £103,166 on the Chillagoe
enterprises, of £9513 on the State cannery, of
£3922 on the State fisheries, and of £101,971 on
the State cattle-stations (£172,461 in 1922-23);
and it has likewise escaped his notice that £281,281
of the Chillagoe deficit and £88,279 of the outlay
on the Mt. Mulligan coal-mine have just been written
off. All this in a State which has a far greater area
of good land than any other and which, as regards
raw material, fuel and proximity to markets, is
magnificently equipped for the development of great
manufacturing industries. Parts of Queensland are,
of course, exceptionally prosperous, but the pros-
perity of the sugar and banana districts, in so far as
it is due to Government policy, is due to the policy
of the Commonwealth Government (which Govern-
ment has incidentally been feeding the Queensland
cattle industry with bounties and has devised a
scheme for succoring the dairy-farmers) ; and the
woolgrowing industry is flourishing in spite of Mr.
Bedford’s Government, which has smitten it with
thumping taxes, differential railway rates and retro-
spective increases in rent. The Queensland Laborites
have had as great an opportunity as was ever given
to a party; and what have they done with it ?
Added 36 millions to the public debt, doubled the
interest bill, doubled the number of Government
employees (thereby creating a grave political
problem), bled the taxpayers white, started the
Golden Casket, and arrived at the point (their
variety of State socialism having egregious! y failed)
where foreign borrowing is their only policy, their
only object to remain in office.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Call for a Super-Representative.
The proposal to consult the High Commis-
sioners of the Dominions about matters. of
foreign policy, in connection with which
Baldwin lias established a precedent, in-
volves us in difficulties. The idea has often
been mooted of a representative Parliament of
Empire in London in which all the Dominions
would have a voice; but a preliminary
trouble in connection with such a scheme is
the basis of representation. If the seats were
held by the various countries in proportion to
their population it is clear that England
must have a majority on all questions; if
another basis were established giving the
Dominions a larger say, it is clear that the
English elector would have a grievance of
a large sort which might make the life of
the system very brief. But that a High
Commissioner should be the sole mouthpiece
of Australia in matters of grave national
concern is a poorer arrangement than any
lopsided overseas Parliament could ever be.
The High Commissioner is only representa-
tive in the sense that he may represent the
Government which originally gave him his
job; but that job may easily lap over into a
period when a Government of wholly dif-
ferent views is in power. Moreover, the
High Commissioner is not chosen as an
adviser on foreign affairs; his business
hitherto has merely been to say obvious
things, to act as the head of a bureau for
gathering information, to assist in the minor
.activities of his dominion in London, and to
attend banquets and other social affairs as
a sort of figurehead. The position which
Baldwin has established is that, after con-
sultation with a High Commisioner, the
people of England and of Europe generally
will regard his action, on the basis of that
consultation, as having behind it the force
of the Dominion whose alleged representative
has spoken in secret. Nothing could be
farther from the wish of democratic Austra-
lians than such a delegation of power. It is
true that Australia could repudiate the
advice its High Commissioner might give;
hut in this there would be little more than
added confusion. The British Prime Min-
ister would already have acted in Australia's
name; and any protest must usually arrive
too late to affect the issue. Possibly the
view might be taken that the High Commis-
sioner can be swiftly informed by cable of
the advice he is to tender; but in a sudden
decision of moment, when information was
changing and opinions were fluctuating from
hour to hour, such transmitted directions
might be worse than useless. What seems
clear is that Australia must conduct her own
foreign policy on Australian soil or appoint
an ambassador in London who can be fully
trusted in emergency to speak in the name
of Australia. Such an ambassador would
hold a more important position than any
to which an Australian has yet been raised.
He would be the dictator of a moment; in
him all Australian democracy must be
summed up at the time of crisis. _ To be these
things he must contrive to be in full touch
with Australian opinion from day to day
and hour to hour, and to remain absolutely
uninfluenced by the fevered political cries or
the country of his residence. Where is such
a man to be found and by what means is
he to be selected?

What We Borrow For.
Lest the uninitiated should stumble by the
way and be deceived, the S. M. Herald
(18/11/’24) explained clearly how these
States float new Public Works loans in
London, and use the money, which never
leaves London, to pay interest ou old loans
in London:—
The misconception which prevails in London regard-
ing the agreement between the States as to borrow-
ing on the London market this year is widespread.
That agreement provides that the States, with the ex-
ception of Victoria and S. Australia in regard to
moderate extra amounts, shall not borrow on the
London market to an amount exceeding their commit-
ments in London. The London papers have interpreted
that statement to mean that borrowing in London would
be confined to conversion loans. The real meaning
of the agreement is that the States will not borrow
in London, with the exception stated, an amount
exceeding the interest (payments which they make
in London, and other payments which they make in
London.
It is as well to have matters like that .put
clearly. In addition to borrowing abroad to
renew old loans, these States have a habit
of borrowing enough gold, or what passes for
gold, to pay interest on their old British
liabilities, these being gold liabilities, and
our paper money being useless in such a
case. Then it is advisable, as a matter of
decent make-believe, to spend here a corres-
ponding amount of paper money, of no more
value than gum-leaves for meeting bills
abroad, on Public Works, or anything that is
called by the name. That lends countenance
to the fiction that the British loans are
Works loans, and not Interest loans. If
the Works built here with paper yield an
annual loss as well as an annual interest
bill, it is all in the day’s work —or day’s
shirk. The gold debt abroad grows bigger,
and so do the gold interest bill abroad and
the loan to pay it with. Out of this arises
the tendency to spend more paper funds on
local works which often pay nothing towards
interest and not much towards working ex-
penses. This keeps up the appearance _of
honesty which is so essential in borrowing
transactions; for if N. S. Wales borrowed,
say, £300,000 of gold in London on the
Public Works ticket, but really to pay in-
terest on gold loans, and didn’t build here,
with local paper, a corresponding Public
Work —say, the Gilmore-Kunama railway,
which cost that amount and has proved itself
capable of losing money at the rate of about
£960 per mile per annum —Ma State would
be guilty of plain dishonesty. The Gilmore-
Ivunama disaster, however superfluous and
ruinous, saves the old lady’s honor. The
situation is one of profound complication, but
all high finance is complicated—especially
when it is so high it shouts for burial.
Municipal Sydney’s Day of Wrath.
Unless the Fuller Government stops it
at the eleventh hour, Sydney will have its
triennial municipal election next week. A
strong Government would have intervened
weeks ago by announcing that the election
was off, and that when the present alder-
manic body had completed its term the city
would be placed under the control of Com-
missioners, the latter to hold office until
everything was ready for a scheme of
municipal government on the lines of
the London County Council. In the
reports of the last town clerk, of the
city engineer, who has resigned in disgust,
of the man in charge of the lighting depart-
ment and other responsible officials, and in
the sworn statements of citizens who have
had dealings with the City Council, there is
overwhelming evidence that municipal Syd-
ney has for years been suffering from gross
maladministration, some of it with a crimi-
nal taint. Within the last month a prominent
member of the finance committee has admitted
having received a present of £25 for services
rendered to a ratepayer in his aldermanic
capacity; and the 1922 Lord Mayor, while
giving reasons for his belief as to the exist-
ence of municipal corruption, mentioned
that the favorite jest at the Town Hall when
a ratepayer having business with the Council
was seen in consultation with an alderman
was “How much are you getting out of it?”
But there is nothing in the record of the
Fuller Government to suggest that it is
capable of ordering the cancellation or post-
ponement of the election, even though the
Royal Commissioner it appointed to inquire
into the latest of numerous “graft” allega-
tions hasn’t completed his work. The Gov-
ernment has known for upwards of two years
that the municipal party corresponding to
its own was divided by bitter animosities,
and that the Labor or Tammany party would
have an excellent chance of slipping in be-
tween the two factions if the first-past-the-
post principle was preserved. But, with
characteristic lethargy, it gave the matter no
attention until a few weeks ago, and in the
makeshift measure then produced—it
authorised a long-overdue redistribution of
wards —there was no provision for preferen-
tial voting. The Labor party will accord-
ingly go to the poll with the comfortable feel-
ing that it is unity contending against dis-
unity. It already enjoys a signal advantage
in that the great body of workers in banks,
offices, warehouses and shops, the majority
of whom are non-Labor, are deprived of votes
for the city, whereas the franchise is enjoyed
by slum-dwellers, shop bookmakers and doss-
house lodgers, who are Laborites to a man.
It can also rely on the block vote of the
municipal laborers, who number nearly a
tenth of the actual ratepayers—more than
a tenth if their dependants who vote as
lodgers are counted —and who belong to a
union affiliated with the A.L.P. On polling
days a large proportion of these laborers
knock off work —or what passes for work in
municipal Sydney—in order to canvass for
the Labor candidate. At the last election Coun-
cil employees were caught impersonating rate-
payers at the ballot-box, prosecuted and sent
to gaol. But the Council soon repented of
its momentary annoyance, and in a resolu-
tion preserved in the municipal archives for
transmission to an admiring posterity the
town clerk was authorised to re-employ them
when they emerged from quod. During the
1918-21 Labor regime tho municipal “servants”
received so many concessions in the way of
high wages, short hours, holidays, overtime
pay, higher-grade pay (when the man above
was away), long leave and retiring allow-
ances that a man gathering rubbish or push-
ing a broom along a gutter was better off
than a fitter in the Newcastle steelworks.
And the indications are that the 1918-21
gentry will return to power, in which case
there will be three more years of Tammany
paternalism and multiplied favors for the
Council employees, in accordance with the
principle of “the municipality for the muni-
cipal laborers.” The disaster is inevitable
unless the anti-Tammany ratepayer who has
hitherto let things slide goes to the poll and
votes against the Labor crowd and those
who have been its allies for the last two
years.

A Question of Domestic Jurisdiction.
The row at Geneva over opium which caused
heated exchanges between Britain and Japan
the other day has an ancient history, and is
another phase of the domestic-international
question which is so hard to adjudicate on.
The murky-looking drug that gave De
Qtjincey such beautiful nightmares was first
described by Pliny —he described everything
except listening-in—and seems to have come
into use originally in Asia Minor. It was
carried to China by the Arabs in the ninth
century, but does not seem to have success-
fully competed for popular favor with
samshu—which tastes like hot methylated-
spirits, and has the same effect —until the
end of the eighteenth century. The "British
East India Co. then took a hand in the busi-
ness, and in a very short time the export
trade to China became the principal source
of Indian revenue. The emaciation of the
nation became so great that in 1820 tho
Chinese Government prohibited its importa-
tion. As it was being grown pretty freely
in China itself, the measure was not re-
garded as entirely altruistic. Next, smuggling
was instituted by the British co. with Chinese
official connivance, and the amount of palm-
grease employed in the business reached a
colossal figure. The position of Commis-
sioner of Canton was as useful to the holder
as the death of an affectionate millionaire
uncle. Numerous awkward incidents led to
the war of 1842. which was the most unin-
spiring conflict Britain ever engaged in, and
ended in a treaty legalising the poison busi-
ness. By 1872 the opium imported from
India to China was worth over £13,000,000
a year, and the trade had become essential
to Indian prosperity. The cultivation in
China was then finally prohibited. It has
been finally prohibited several times since,
but some careful person has evidently pre-
served a few seeds, because it has always
reappeared again when the omens were pro-
pitious. The sincerest attempt to abolish the
silent horror was made when the Republi-
cans first took charge. Their zeal and en-
thusiasm were tremendous. Devotees made
bonfires of their pipes, and one provincial
Governor went the length of rounding up
all the hopeless sots in his district, digging
a large grave for them, pouring petrol on
them and setting them alight. The Gov-
ernment also took a hand, purchased large
stocks of the drug held in foreign ware-
houses worth several millions, and burnt
that. It is instinctive in the human animal,
however, to want to put physiological strains
upon himself, and it was not long before the
coolies who. were accustomed to smoke their
mite of opium before going to work could
be seen lined up in the morning outside the
chemists’ shops for a hypodermic injection;
and an enormous illicit trade in all the most
reliable poisons grew up between Japan and
China via Tsingtao. It is Japan’s reluct-
ance to give this last up which is causing
all the trouble. It says something for inter-
national, morality that nobody wants to go
to war about it. Or, perhaps, there arc other
factors. The inalienable right of a strong
country to force an admitted poison on a
weak one was established by two wars be-
tween Britain and China ; that none of the
countries which have suffered financially
through U.S.A.’s liquor prohibition have
offered to fight her on that issue, for instance,
may be due to the existence rather of a
powerful American navy than of an over-
whelming sense of decency amongst the other
nations.
«
The Campaign Against Syphilis.
“Q.E.D.” on a question of tactics:—
Why should anyone assume that it is anatomically
impossible to protect a woman from v.d. ? Merely
because it has never been done before? Well, when
Metschnikoff or Calmette first demonstrated the
efficacy of calomel ointment, that had never been
done before. The chinosol tablet is slowly effer-
vescent, and a fine germicidal film spreads over
all the surfaces to be protected, just as, when calomel
ointment is used, a fine germicidal film spreads over
one of the surfaces. At first, indeed, calomel was
used in the tablets, but it was found in some cases,
e.g., when many tablets were used, that it caused
salivation. Furthermore, there are some persons who
cannot tolerate even the smallest amount of mercury
in any form.
It is true, of course, that the germicidal action of
drugs, when used on living tissue, especially in the
body cavities, is not always the same as the action
of the same drug used on the same kind of germ
in the laboratory. But is there any reason why
chinosol should not be tested as calomel has been?
Laboratory tests made at St. Paul’s Hospital, London,
have shown that chinosol—l in 2'oo0 —will kill the
germs of both gonorrhoea and syphilis in less than
one minute. The tablets in question contain chino-
sol, 1 in 1000. I have reason to believe, though at
present I have no actual proof, that chinosol has
been used successfully as a prophylactic in England,
France and Germany. At any rate, the effervescing
chinosol tablet has the approval and endorsement
of no less a personage than Sir Arbuthnot Lane,
one of the world’s greatest surgeons, who is of
opinion that it is anatomically possible to prevent
venereal disease in women by prophylactic measures.
The wowsers wowse just as energetically against
prophylaxis as against contraception, and in reality
the incidental contraceptive qualities of chinosol are
an additional advantage in the case of persons suffer-
ing from venereal disease. Surely not even a Cus-
toms House official would be so wrong-headed as
to believe that persons with either gonorrhcea or
syphilis should be parents? Besides, there is no
good reason why the tablets should not be manu-
faetured here; the process is quite simple. Then
they could be bought in every chemist’s shop ju B t
as calomel ointment can—with this additional advan-
tage, that they protect both men and women. Cer-
tainly anything which prevents venereal disease in
men—if used consistently by all men every time
they risk infection—will stamp out venereal disease
in time; but it will take a long time. But a
germicide that protects both men and women is
likely to stamp it out at least twice as quickly.
Probably the ratio is far greater than two to one,
considering the number of men who can be infected
by one woman.
Whether it be true or no that syphilis is more
commonly transmitted by the prostitute than by
the “amateur,” the fact remains: had both amateur
and prostitute an easy means of preventing them-
selves contracting venereal disease, it is certain
that most of them —unless they be drunk or feeble-
minded—would protect themselves. Then there would
be a considerable diminution in the number of
men who die of brain disease through syphilis; there
would be thousands of women, now rendered sterile,
or condemned to unmerited suffering, who could
be the healthy mothers of large families; and
thousands of the babies now born crippled, blind
or idiot might be born healthy, and grow into useful
citizens.

Tomfullery.
In 1918 no one would have thought of pre-
dicting that Fuller, the N. S. Wales con-
scriptionist—then Col. Secretary and now
Premier —would become the instrument, and
that deliberately, of elevating a Labor paci-
fist to the Senate at the expense of a returned
soldier with a good record of public as well
as military service. It would have been
unsafe to venture such a prophecy in a
Nationalist club. Yet the grotesque proceed-
ing was witnessed in the N.S.W. Parliament
last week. The returned soldier was Colonel
Abbott, who used to be a Liberal M.H.R.,
the same as Fuller, and who polled 78,000
votes two years ago as a Country-party can-
didate for the Senate. The pacifist was J.
M. Power, who has never stood for a Federal
constituency, and who, as delegate to the
Perth Labor Conference in 1918, proposed
the infamous resolution that the Allies
should conclude a peace which, in the then
military situation, would have been a con-
fession of overwhelming defeat. Fuller’s
reason for exalting this extraordinary person
was that, a Labor Senator having died, the
seat “belonged” to the Labor party. But
no seat in the Senate “belongs” to any party,
or any person, until it has been won in the
appointed manner. Moreover, the Senate, as
Fuller’s crowd has maintained often enough,
was never meant to be a party House. Again,
when a Nationalist Senator dies or retires
Labor invariably nominates a man for the
vacancy and, if a State Labor (government
happens to be in office, gets him in—witness
the case of the Laborite J. Y. MacDonald.
who was appointed by the Labor-controlled
Queensland Parliament to succeed the
Nationalist John Adamson in 1922. By
rejecting Abbott in favor of the gentleman
who was conspicuous at Perth and who, as
president of the N.S.W. Labor executive, was
a party to some very remarkable proceedings
—they are recorded in the malodorous his-
tory of “the movement” — Fuller has infuri-
ated the State Cockies, embarrassed the re-
lations between the Federal Cockies and the
Federal Nationalists, and convinced the re-
turned soldiers that his party’s declared policy
of preference to them in all things is not to
be relied on.
The Impossible Pearce.
A cry from his principality:—
In September, 1923, a well-known Northern Terri-
tory family, dissatisfied with the irregular work that
in the industrial situation at Darwin was all they
could obtain, applied to the Primary Producers’
Board for assistance in settling at Anson Bay, which
lies 130 miles south-w T est of Darwin. The Board,
which is supposed to exist for the purpose of settling
people on the land, consists of three kindly old
gentlemen, all residents of Darwin and all totally
ignorant of farming. Its reply was that it couldn’t
think of permitting settlers to take up land in a
place so inconvenient and far away. The head of
the family then wrote to the Minister for Home
and Territories, and was advised, by that functionary
to consult the Administrator, who was empowered to
deal with such cases through the Primary Pro-
ducers’ Board. Meanwhile the applicant had inter-
ested others in the Anson Bay scheme, and six in-
tending settlers joined forces with him—2s in all,
with women and children. Then the P. P. Board dis-
covered that the land could not be inspected owing
to no boat being available. This although the inspec-
tors could have proceeded overland by way of Stapleton
and Daly River, where a few settlers are ekeing out
a living. Not until the last week in July was an
inspector sent. He spent four days at Anson Bay,
but at date of writing (Nov. 1) his report is still
unprocurable. Before he set out, however, word
was received by the settlers from the exuberant
George Foster Pearce that reports in his posses-
sion had made him believe that the project could
not succeed except at great expenditure, and, there-
fore, he would not approve of it. But Pearce
didn’t consider it necessary to notify the P. P.
Board, so the inspector was sent on his useless mis-
sion. As to reports on Anson Bay, an authoritative
one has been -written by W. J. Young, of Darwin,
who spent four years there, and who certifies to the
existence of “rich red sandy loam, suitable for any
crops this climate permits; excellent timber for
fencing and building, not difficult to clear; unlimited
water at shallow depths; cheap and plentiful labor
(native, of course), and abundant game and fish,”
Repulsed from Anscn Bay, the settlers have been
offered inducements to settle at the Katherine, but
these they have declined. For one reason, because
the land available at the Katherine is inferior to
what they could select, on their own account, at
Anson Bay; and, for another, because the cost of
living, in the pioneering stages, would be very
much dearer. They would have to get their supplies
railed to the Katherine; they could have them trans-
ported by lugger to Anson Bay. They are all prac-
tical, acclimatised men, with a good knowledge of
out-back life and its requirements and of Anson
Bay and its vicinity. How can the Territory
struggle out of its difficulties if willing pioneers arc
to be humbugged by, and if settlement is to depend
on the caprice of absurd jacks-in-office at the other
end of the continent ?

THe Ideal of Durability
The striving for perfection that in past years produced
the Chippendale and the Sheraton, to-day produces the
beautiful Smith & Waddington body with its matchless
durability.
With a rigidly enforced policy that none but perfect
materials may bear the Smith & Waddington name,
maximum durability is a natural result, just as the beauty
of the body; its deep, full-toned finish; broad, inviting,
restful seats and rich upholstery are the result of unstinted

demobilisation of these two wonderful natu
ral resources there will be a redistribution of
wealth. Coal-and-oil countries, such as the
F.S., and coal countries like England. South
Scotland, Belgium and Germany will lose
much of their unearned preponderance, while
practically coal-less States, such as Spain,
Portugal, Italy, Ireland and Greece, or ill-
supplied ones, such as France, will have an
uplift. N. S. Wales will be one of the
losers, and S. Australia one of the gainers.
My inclination is to believe in Anton
Flettner, for he only claims to have done
something which was inevitable. He is said
to have devised a marvellously improved
method of gathering wind-power—of collect-
ing very much more power for very much
less money, and reducing waste and leakage.
Considering the marvels that have been done
by way of eliminating waste in the use of
steam-power, and how little has been done
in this way with wind (for the modern sail-
ing-ship gathers its force just as that of
Columbus ((id), the man with the Dutch
name has set out to fill a mighty big want.
Assuming that air force, instead of being
used raw and wild, can be captured in large
quantities with handy apparatus and cooked
into electricity, there is not the slightest
reason why the wind shouldn’t drive a ship
against the wind and faster than the wind
goes itself. It is as natural as it is that
a coal seam lying from north to south should
he the means of driving a vessel from east
to west, or from south to north, though
the seam itself is motionless. And I see
no reason against the claim that the speed
attained will be something far beyond any
ever secured by the old methods, for old
methods, especially when they are older than
any fixed date that anybody can impale with
accuracy, are insanely wasteful and ineffi-
cient. With proper and improved reservoirs
and tank appliance to provide for storage, it
is difficult to see that either a ship or a city
should go short, despite occasional calms.
The idea of the imperishable Flettner has
in its favor these incontrovertible facts:—
Wind exists in vast quantities, is often of great
strength, and is the most widespread and accessible
force known.
It is cheap to get, for it hasn't to be bored for
after the manner of coal and oil. The searcher for
wind never spends a fortune and strikes a dud. Never,
by any chance, is the wind-mine a wild cat. And
so far as we know the supply is inexhaustible.
It doesn’t lend itself to monopoly as fixed subter-
ranean or surface fuels do.
And, as already hinted at, wind is an almost un-
trodden field of endeavor the same as the South Pole
before Amundsen went there, so little has been done
towards developing its possibilities on a large com-
mercial scale. As in Tibet, there is room for dis-
covery, while in many other lines the deposit of un-
used opportunity looks like running low.
Even should the find of the wildly-gifted
Flettner prove only a partial success, it
doesn’t follow that research should be aban-
doned or even relaxed. I propose that the
Australian Government offer an annual prize
of £IO,OOO for the best and most practicable
wind-power machine produced during the
year, the one stipulation being that each
prize-winner must be a little better than
any known existing machine. This would
be an attempt to develop a resource which
we know we possess, and almost the only
one. if not the only one. that we possess in
as great abundance as the next fellow. Our
ascertained coal reserves are not extraordi-
nary—the most up-to-date cyclopedia doesn’t
even mention Australia among the half-
dozen countries which it quotes as having a
future in this line. Australia’s gold vield
at its best, and its best was long enough ago,
wasn’t one-third that of the Transvaal to-
day, though that little ex-republic has been
going half a century, and might well show
signs of short-windedness. No other area
of the size is so short of water-power and
tree-fuel as ours, and the flow of oil is less
than that of England, which accidentally
found 342 tons in 1921. But there is wind
here for certain, and whoever says it isn’t as
good as any other fellow’s wind is a caitiff,
and lies in his throat.—Yours, etc., James
Edmond.

The Gyppo in His True Colors.
In the early days of the war Britain de-
posed the Khedive Abbas llit.mt, who had
been intriguing with the Germans and Turks,
and declared a Protectorate over Egypt,
which country had been under British con-
trol since 1882. The Protectorate, with Sul-
tan Hussein Kamil as titular ruler —he
died in 1917 and was succeeded by A timed
Fuad Pasha, liis brother—lasted, nominally
at least, for seven years. In 1919, however,
after a series of murderous local outbreaks
which kept our Light Horsemen—war-weary
and sick for home —in a hated land for
months after they had settled accounts with
Jacko, an attempt was made to gratify the
sullen native population by announcing that
the policy of Britain was “to preserve the
autonomy of Egypt under British protection
and to develop the system of self-government
under an Egyptian ruler.” This having no
visible effect, a mission under Lord Milner
was sent to Cairo to ascertain how “the legi-
timate aspirations of the Egyptians” could
he satisfied. Finally, on February 2S. 1922,
Egypt was recognised as an independent
sovereign State. If any peacemongering
Briton imagined that the concession would
be received with thanks he was speedily un-
deceived. The immediate result was the
arrival in power of Zagiilul I’asha, the ex-
tremist leader, with a programme which in-
cluded the expulsion of all British influence
from the ungrateful country of the Pyra-
mids, and the assertion of full Egyptian
authority over the Soudan. The government
of the Soudan was one of several questions
reserved for future discussion when the grant
of independent sovereignty was made. Con-
quered from Egypt,- a comparatively recent
invader, by the Mahdi, it was re-
scued from barbarism by Kitchener,
and has been peacefully developed for
a quarter of a century on the lines
that he laid down. There is no evidence that
the Soudanese want to be governed by the
Egyptians. On the contrary, there is every
likelihood that they would welcome their
new rulers with lethal weapons in their
hands, after the fashion of their fathers, if
the British withdrew. But the Gyppo lias
become arrogant and truculent under the
new dispensation, and last week, following-
on Zaghlul’s return from London, where
even Clumsy Macshuffle told him that the
Soudan would on no account be surrendered,
Sir L. O. F. Stack, Governor-General of the
Province, was assassinated in the streets of
Cairo by a band of “patriots” using dum-
dum bullets. The Zaghlulists will pay dearly
for this revelation of their capacity for inde-
pendent sovereignty. Some mad ideas have
been current since the self-determination
HOCH! HOCH ! HOCH!
"Notwithstanding that, the Mandates Commission at Geneva, is perfectly satisfied with the manner in
which the Australian administration is carrying out its duties, the London Socialist Review recently
repeated the allegations made annually by an ‘advanced’ section of the Australian Labor party as to
atrocities’ committed in what used to be German New Guinea.”
THE BYSTANDER: “Go it, gomrade! Mont St. Kcrventin is avenged!"
theory was let loose on a 1 distracted world,
but nothing madder than the notion that the
Gyppo was fit for self-government on the
Occidental plan.

A great deal too much cable space is taken
up with the sayings of plausible nobodies
abroad who tell Australia how to manage
its business in their interests. The other
day 36 lines were given to one H. R. Cairo,
of London, chairman of the Mercantile Land
and Finance Co., doubtless a philanthropic
institution of the highest order. Said he :—■
Australia persists in maintaining a very high
tariff, and her policy is that everything required for
new works that can be produced in Australia should
be used in preference to imported articles. As the
only means of getting payment for exports is from
the volume of imports....
Rubbish of that kind is the reward Australia
gets for charging Britain such a low tariff
that this country is flooded with goods from
John Bull’s country—often Hun goods
which the “slim” Britisher has passed on—■
to such an extent that its mere handful of
people constitute Bull’s second- or third-best
customer. It is the sort of reward that fools
get. and deserve. The pompous maxim is
quite played out that the only way to get
payment for the merchandise we send J.
Bull is to take his camouflaged German
merchandise by way of return. Australia
can take payment for lots of surplus exports
by buying back its securities. There arc
hundreds of millions of them to buy back.
When it has paid off its old foreign debt with
goods it can buy British or other foreign
bonds, if it likes, and set up as a creditor
country. The United States has been doing
that sort of thing for many years, and taking
no notice of Freetrade confidence men across
the Atlantic who said it couldn’t be done.

Canadian “business interests” will be as
mad as their own bears if they fail to bring
off that amazing deal by which Australia is
to give the Canuck free admission for eight
important lines of machinery and receive in
return a preference on beeswax, with other
similar exchanges. Cabled summaries of
Canadian utterances on the topic are quite
exciting. One influential Montreal paper
recently warned this country that if its Par-
liament refused to ratify the bargain it would
thereby fall into contempt and degradation
and commit a serious breach of international
relations. This, which folloived, was in a
milder key:—
Business interests in touch with the situation claim
that there is no desire on the part of the people of
Australia as a whole to abrogate the trade treaty with
Canada. They assert that opposition to the treaty is
coming from the manufacturing interests , which stand
to lose the Australian market in the event of prefer-
ential duties being granted to Canadian commodities
imported into Australia.
Manufacturing interests hereabouts, in the
woollen line especially, sustained a most dis-
astrous knock in the Australian market
through the silly preference given to Britain.
Now some of them anticipate another knock
through the still more crazy proposed prefer-
ence to Canada. “Business interests” in
Canada take the same view about our ap-
proaching disaster if we sign their unconvinc-
ing document. But they apparently fail to
see why such no-account folk as Australian
manufacturers (carefully distinguished from
“the people as a whole”) should be con-
sidered even if they do “stand to lose the
Australian market.”

“Rio”: Some of our rifle clubs are again
inviting the charge that pot-hunting and not
defence is their main objective. For years
now the military forces belonging to the
Northern Rivers of N. S. Wales have been
administered from Brisbane, and those of
Broken Hill from Adelaide. This, of course,
is handier and more economical in every way
than if the absurd State boundaries were
used. But the big rifle meeting at Sydney
offers better prizes than those at Adelaide or
Brisbane; hence the clubs of the districts
mentioned are dissatisfied and are making
a great outcry to be administered from Syd-
ney. One of their arguments is that they
are “enrolled under the same regulations as
the military forces.” But what would be
said if the Broken Hill trainees wanted their
annual camp held in Sydney?

“Anti-Dingo” : Wool is our big key industry.
Fine fleece is the only commodity that the
buyers of the world come to Australia to com-
pete for, and its production is capable of
wonderful expansion. What is being done to
encourage it? Millions are being wasted in
Queensland on such things as the Burnett
scheme, to produce more of the commodities
of which we already have too much, while the
dingoes are eating the slieep-man off the face
of the earth. Years ago scores of thousands
of. sheep were run in the Tliargomindali dis-
trict ; dogs literally ate them out. If the
State Government had spent or would spend
half as much money on dog-netting as has
been wasted on the Inkerman and Burnett
schemes, the country would now be reaping
a rich reward and the Kidman problem, if
there is one, would solve itself. Now the
(lovernment is about to sell the War'rego
Babbit Board fence (from Hadden corner to
about Goondiwindi) for what it can get.
either as an existing fence or as material. I
understand. A small portion of the money
wasted on the abovementioned schemes would
make this fence dog-proof and form
a break against the northward and eastward
trend of the dogs that exist in south-western
Queensland in greater numbers than else-
where in Queensland. This would also be a
starting-point for groups on each side to dog-
proof from—if netting were made available
to selectors on long terms. People do not
realise what wonderful sheep country this is
—light carrying, of course, but the sweetest
in the world. I would venture to say that
10,000 good men could be settled between
Goondiwindi and Winton within two years
if land and wire-netting were made avail-
able.

Fok the thousand-and-oneth time a mis-
carriage of justice has taken place for lack
of a uniform Federal divorce law, and Justice
Macfarlan (Vic.) made the usual remark
about the loafing Parliament of thousand-
pounders who have time for anything except
their job, though he didn’t put it that way.
It was the usual question of State boundaries
and domicile. If Parliament ever feels like
earning its wages it might put in a useful
session by enacting uniform marriage,
divorce, banking, bankruptcy, insurance and
company laws: and by way of diversion it
might abolish the export of gold, tariff pre-
ference, the baby bonus, the crazy joke about
signing political articles during election cam-
paigns, the compulsory voting fad and a good
part of the Navigation Act. It might even
then, if it were industrious, have time to pro-
vide for a referendum on the question of giv-
ing the Commonwealth power to make new
States, and establish a uniform sinking fund,
under Federal control, for State debts.
Thanks to the blessings of consolidation,
there should be half a hundred fewer laws to
remember when these things are done.

This week the first number of a woman’s
paper—the Mirror —-was issued from Tin;
Bulletin office. The time seemed to have
arrived when women’s enormously multiplied
activities and interests called for more at-
tention than The Bulletin could possibly
give them; so an entirely separate publica-
tion was decided upon. It will be published
on Tuesdays, and will be interested in every-
thing in which women are interested: it
will have a serial story (the first is by
Ethel Turner) and numerous short stories.;
there will be sections devoted to dress
and fashions, home decoration, cookery,
the sick-room, sport and games, books,
the theatres, music and dancing; there
will be pages for children and pages
devoted to women’s public work; and
a specially-designed dress-pattern will be
supplied free with every issue. Each
issue will consist of 64 pages, and it seems
a good deal to offer for threepence ; but. as
a very large circulation is assured, the adver-
tising will, it is believed, make possible some-
thing far better than has ever before been
attempted in Australia. The whole thing
will be well illustrated, and in every respect
will be as good as The Bulletin’s very
extensive organisation can make it.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Tlie inter-State shipping cos. have with-
drawn the 25 p.c. surcharge on cargo an-
nounced as a result of the overtime strike
on the wharves* and explain that they never
actually enforced it. These cos. were dragged
into the demented dispute, although the
Waterside Workers’ Federation had no
grievance against them. The Commonwealth
line was also involved because of the usual
monthly outbreak of job-control, and the
spectacle has been witnessed of wharfies
working briskly on a Japanese steamer while
a Commonwealth Government liner, which pays
three times Japanese rates of wages, was
under the union ban—-declared “black.”
Under the guidance of “pommy” officials,
some of whom are known to be. Russian
agents, Australian unionists are leaping on
their own altars.
The last word-—perhaps :
Theodore has done a courageous thing. When he
was appointed to report on the numerous inquiries
concerning the ballot-boxes with sliding panels,
with power virtually to re-admit the politicians
expelled by the N.S.W. Labor executive, the general
idea was that his verdict had already been written,
in a sense, by the A.W.U. executive. That was cer-
tainly the impression of T. J. Smith, M.L.C., the
principal witness for the prosecution, who refused to
give evidence on the ground that Theodore was biassed
in favor of the A.W.U. Others likewise found it
impossible to believe that the big man would find
against one of the heads of a union for which lie
himself worked as organiser, by whose aid he has
risen to a commanding position, and which has
always stood behind him in his fight with the
Queensland Reds. But Theodore went on his wav.
Days he gave to the hearing of oral statements,
diversified by fish-fag wrangles ; nights to the study
of documentary evidence. And the result is a
decision that there is nothing against Sutherland,
“but with regard to Messrs Bailey (M.L.A. for Goul-
burn and N.S.W. boss of the A.W.U.), Bramston
(Sydney Labor alderman) and Buckley (ex-M.L.A.
for Sydney and ex-secretary of the N. S. Wales
A.R.U.) I am convinced that they had knowledge
of the proposal to make fraudulent boxes, and find
accordingly”—which means that their life expulsion
stands. The judgment has the impress of honesty,
and, whatever the effect on the judge’s standing
with A.W.U. officialdom, it has added cubits to his
political stature in the eyes of unprejudiced men.
The S.A. Leg. Council has been rejecting
Labor bills at a brisk rate, and the Gunn
Government had hopes that the electors of
Barossa would thereby be goaded into return-
ing a Labor man for the vacancy caused by
ex-Treasurer Hague’s decease. Their hopes
were not realised. At the general election
in April Barossa, a three-member constitu-
ency, chose two Laborites and Hague. Chi
Saturday Crosby, who was one of Hague’s
colleagues in the last Parliament, beat the
Labor candidate, Murphy, with 600 votes to
the good or thereabouts. Which supports
the impression, widely held in South Aus.,
that if Harwell had gone in for preferential
voting and contrived to avoid quarrelling with
the Cockies and saying foolish things about
the White Australia policy, Gunn’s party
would still be the Opposition.
’L'lie advice of the visiting experts that all
N.S.W. railway repair-work should be done
in Sydney suggests that the two knights were
completely fogged in surveying the lines of
a State as big as N. S. Wales. The curse
of the system is centralisation, which creates
congestion, and means delay and great loss
of efficiency. But the grand idea of going
further and towing every disabled locomotive
and every shaky truck to one central depot
for repair calls up a picture of swearing and
sweating officials laboring desperately to get
the lines clear while the express waits in
the hot northerly winds and the passengers
make remarks as old as Stephenson. Fraser
might be worth the extra £2OOO they think he
should get if he could preserve himself from
assassination under such a scheme.
By electing Downward and Bourchier,

of new men that their inexperience is a danger to
their fellow workers.” —Union statement.

do they? Why, some of ’em haven’t been

Macßrell, M.L.A.. and Crockett, M.L.C.
(honorary), the other three chosen by ballot,
are Allanites. Weaver suffered by the com-
promise. He was under the disadvantage,
also, of fighting for a place against Col.
Bourcliier, hero of a hundred or more scraps
in Palestine during the 1914-18 disturbance.
As a son-in-law of the late Prank Madden,
Speaker for 13 years (1904-17), Bourcliier
had a social pull too.
Regulation item from the Sydney papers:
The Works Committee approved of the construc-
tion of a line from Rand to Bull Plain, near the
Vic. border. The line will be 28 miles in length,
and the estimated cost is £176,000.
This will be an extension of the line from
Henty to Rand, which pays nothing towards
interest and doesn’t even meet working ex-
penses. It will lie adjacent to, and more or
less parallel with, five other lines, four of
which pay no interest and don’t meet work-
ing: expenses, while the fifth manages to meet
working expenses, but not interest. Nobody
expects them to become any better, and, in
fact, four are becoming worse. The build-
ing of a spider’s web of little lines, mostly
to carry wheat at below cost, is a poor busi-
ness. But they are built partly because a few
votes are to be bought that wajf and partly
because they lead to no port where a new
commercial and industrial city might arise
and supply a shorter and cheaper cut to
foreign markets.
The British manufacturer looks a gift
horse in the mouth with a microscope these
days. His Federation of Industries ap-
pointed a committee to consider this coun-
try’s proposal to make him a smaller gift in
future —in short, to require goods to be 75
per cent. British in order to get preference
as British goods. The committee proposes:
That articles manufactured in Britain but from
imported materials shall be given preference even if
the raw material constitutes 95 per cent, of the
ultimate price.
That articles may be to a great extent of foreign
manufacture, and not made in Britain, and still
get full preference provided the raw material is
British.
The first proposition reads like preference to
German material touched up in Britain, and
the second like preference to British-nigger
material manufactured in Germany. If J.
Bull has so lost confidence in his own manu-
facturing capacity and so completely settled
down to the middleman’s business as this
suggests, it might be better for Australia to
go out of the preference line till the Old Man
in London provides himself with a tariff,
and Britain makes its own British goods.
A younger man will be chosen as Labor
leader in Victoria next year. The Parlia-
mentary party is now less reluctant than it
has been to make a change, as Prendergast,
who. is nearly 71, has gratified his life’s
ambition to be Premier. Tunnecliffe and
Hogan will be rivals for the job, and their fol-
lowers are so evenly divided that a eompro-
mise man (Bailey perhaps) may be suggested
to avoid ill feeling. It would help the
party in the provinces to have a country
leader, but Tuimecliffe (Collingwood) has a
status hard to ignore. He ranked next to
Prendergast in Hie Labor Government.
Senator Pearce’s Home and Territories
Department still hurries on the zig-zag tenor
of its way. One recent revelation concerns
its way of searching for oil in Papua. It
has removed its own expert, and entrusted
the business to the officials of the Anglo-
Persian Oil Co., who obligingly attend to
the Commonwealth’s interests for mere ex-
penses. The company’s reports of work
done are not submitted to the inspection of
experts. A high official testified that under
the present management the search had had
no luck. It had been suggested that the
company s officials might be instructed to
carefully avoid luck (for the Government, of
course), but this is a lying and slanderous
world, and the Minister, so far as the official
witness knew, didn’t think the matter worth
investigation. This raises an important
qnestion: Supposing some day a war is on.
and the same remarkable Minister or his dup-
lirate makes a saving by entrusting the com-
mand of our army to the rival or hostile
general, who kindly agrees to look after both
interests. _ And supposing that, instead of a
tai.r division of victories, we cease to win
any and a rumor goes round that the rival
X.ii w-u f« nera i doesn’t intend that we
shall. VVill the astonishing Department think
that matter worth looking into?
llie good the Vic. Labor Government pro-
posed is buried with it, but the harm, of
winch the Police Commission is a part, lives
on In the first place a modest hundred was
voted tor the expenses of the commission,
but recently the cost of the useless business
vas given as £2300 and more will be re-
quired. Yet the inquiry had no other object
than getting a sort of official sanction for the
reinstatement of the policemen who struck

Opposition wliat it was afraid to perform

opposed to the reinstatement of the strikers

There are persons in England who are less
maudlin than we are about the “rights” of
self-imported characters like Fritz Schwindle
and Ivan Dambadski. The new Home Sec-
retary intimates that the law will resume
business after its partial suspension, and this
is liis reading of it: —

law must be deported.”
Britain keeps a register of its aliens, and the
one who tries to dodge registration goes out.
hor naturalisation it requires at least five
years residence, a reputation only a little
lower than that of the angels, proof that the
applicant means to stay and isn’t simply
desirous of the British status for protection
in foreign adventures, and, among other
things, a knowledge of English. Even
after all this it is possible for the license to
be cancelled and the patient deported in the
event of a moral lapse. In 1922 the gate
was slammed against 1997 foreign applicants.
Th ® .Passive-resistance policy of Gandhi,
the Hindu lawyer, was overborne at the
recent ‘ Nationalist” conference at Calcutta,
which witnessed the triumph of the extrem-
ist section, under Chunder Das —a typical
(at Bengali habit. The extremists communi-
cate with Moscow, and their young men have
a weakness for letting off bombs. They will
probably give Birkenhead, the new man at
the India Office, a great chance of clearing
up the ‘lndian question,” which troubles a
very small minority of India’s polyglot, many-
religioned and infinitely varied population.
Probably the whole of the “Nationalists”
who really matter would fit comfortably into

Interesting item in the advertisement of
the embryo Standard Portland Cement Co.:
Even before cement is produced the township sub
division should show sufficient profit to pay a dividend.
There is not a big manufacturing country
111 . world in which the industrial
chiefs don’t see that the sweating landlord is
their enemy, and almost everywhere they
have taken measures to beat him. In Eng-
land the Levers have established their own
Port Sunlight, and in America Ford goes
out to the smaller country towns. But in
Australia too often the manufacturer’s first
idea, as in this case, is to put up either the
price of local land or the rents —in other
words, increase his own costs.
During the recent Federal session an un-
usual quantity of mud was heaved at the
party in office. Furtive gentlemen with
scandals” up their sleeves had the time of
“eir lives. . Any journalist possessed of a
dud sensation,” any clerk primed with office
information about a capitalist’s taxes (so
long as the capitalist wasn’t a wealthy friend
of the masses, like Wren), any discharged
servant with a cock-and-bull story about
atrocities in New Guinea was sure of a warm
welcome and extensive publicity. Sometimes
it happened that Australia was defamed in
the process, but that doesn’t seem to have
mattered a dump. This evident faith in the
political efficacy of the muckrake may be
justified in Australia, but it wasn’t in
America the other day. There the party that
relied on the unpleasant implement was
horribly licked. The electors decided that
the muckrake was a poor substitute for a
national policy.
An industry threatened by cheap importa-
tions and the opposition of the workers to
piecework is the manufacture of crockery at
Subiaco (W.A.). The State has plenty of
clays eminently suitable for making cups
and saucers, and there are about 150 people
employed. But the works have to compete
with the cheap-labor products of Japan.
China and Austria; and, though the indus-
try might have a chance with the present
Protection, the workers are so wedded to
go-slow and the weekly wage that the future
is doubtful.
THE END OF THE INQUIRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Theodore: ‘ls there proof that any such ballot-
boxes existed?’ A Witness: ‘I have never seen them.’
Another Witness: ‘l’m sure they were never used.
Tile board had to be moved with a hammer.’ ”
—Extract from press report of the latest Ballot-box
inquiry.
The question rose who cooked the fish.
Suspicion fell on Jack and Jim
And Charlie, who had held the dish,
And Sam because Jack looked at him. ■
In council grave the elders sat
To sift tiie matter to the core;
They even analysed the cat
And took exhibits from the floor.
They questioned Tom, they questioned Sue,
They found the man who made the net
That caught the fish, and asked a crew
Of yachtsmen how the sea got wet.
They filled large papers full of words;
And someone swore to all they wrote,
Till, fluttering like evil birds,
The room was full of script and note.
Then solemnly they judged the case,
With heavy brows and language sad,
And told the culprits to their face
The thing they did was wrong and bad.
They pushed them gently through the door,
They threw them softly in the street
And told them to come back no more
Because their guilt was quite complete.
Then Alfred, who was very deaf
And had not heard the row at all,
Came capped and aproned, like a chef,
And sought a cupboard in the wall.
The judges stared with all their eyes,
Amazed at that plain thing they saw ;
For there, ’mid fragments of stale pies,
The fish remained unsealed and raw.
And did they bring back Jack and Jim
And Charles and Sam to share the view?
Not on your life! The light grew dim;
The family friend knew what to do.
He swiftly seized a knife and fork
And raised the snapper in the air—
“ Comrades,” he said, “this bird is pork,
As doubtless all of you will swear.”

“Tenansix”: “Bay Webb” (B. 13/11/’24)
perpetuates a long-exploded tradition when
he states that “the child born aboard a ship
on the English registry whilst the ship is
over three miles from land is upon the regis-
try of Stepney, London.” Nearly 40 years
ago, at a social gathering in Melbourne, a

well-known managing law-clerk mentioned
that, having been born on an English wind-
jammer during a voyage from London to
Hobart, he “belonged” to the parish of Step-
ney. Another man of law corrected him with
the assertion that Hobart was his legal birth-
place. Many wagers were made, and finally
John Madden, later on C.J. of Victoria,
agreed to referee. He gave his verdict for
Hobart, and suggested that to test it the
native of the high seas should write to both
Stepney and Hobart for a certificate of his
birth. This was done. The document duly
arrived from the latter place; the Stepney
official merely advised Ins correspondent to
apply to “the local Registrar at the port of
Hobart Town.” The Stepney fiction has been
obsolete for nearly 100 years as far as it
concerns those born on the way to Aus-
tralia.
“O’Back”: How little the city knows of
the emptiness of Outback! Not long ago
word came to Broken Hill that an old-age
pensioner had died in a lonely spot where
there were only a woman and a couple of
youngsters. The woman and the boys could
sink the hole and make a box, but would
they please send a policeman to help put
him in the hole? A man was sent.
“Boleg” : Not all
the war-time bloom-
ers were made by
the Tommies.
When our engineers
fired three tons of
explosives at Hill
00, the debris had
hardly stopped fall-
ing before the min-
ers were at work
again in the broken
ground ahead. As
this involved seri-
ous risk from the
combustion gases
filtering through to
the workings, white
mice or canaries
were provided to
act as detectors,
while a two-incli
pipe carrying com-
pressed air fur-
nished additional
protection for the
delvers. When
Lieut. Ardk a s e
took two of his
sappers into the
head of a drive, he
left them a caged
white mouse, with
instructions
to watch it care-
fully, and, if it
should show signs
of drowsiness, to go
for their lives. On
his return in an
hour’s time, he
found the cage
carefully hung
where its occupant
would get the most
benefit from the
compressed a i r.
“Y on blanky
fools!” he hissed.
“Doing a fool thing
like that might
have cost both of
you your lives.” Broken Hill Peter resented
the reproof. “The little bit of air that poor
little blighter would use wouldn’t make no
difference to us!” he grumbled.
“Billy See”: Re the last
requests of criminals await-
ing the gallows. One of the
first murders in Coolgardie
happened when Goulam
Maho m e t shot Tagli
Mahomet, the most influen-
tial Afghan on the fields,
while he was at prayer in
the little galvanised-iron
mosque. Goulam was tried
at Perth in 1896, and sen-
tenced to death. No motive
for the deed was discoverable
to a white man; but the
’Ghans were strongly divided
on the matter, and while the
murderer lay in the Fre-
mantle condemned-cell his
friends tried to provide him
with a means of cheating the
hangman. Goulam asked for
the Afghan equivalent of
kosher meat, which, of course,
could only be got from his
countrymen. It was good food
for several days ; then one day
it came in loaded with poison.
But the authorities had been
warned, and until he met
John Ketch, two weeks later,
meat was off Goulam’s
menu.
“Bouragi”: The recent ruling of the U.S.
Federal Court, that beverages brewed in the
home, for home consumption, need not com-
ply with the “one-half of one per
cent, of alcohol” fixed as the maxi-
mum by the Volstead Act, reminds me
of certain happenings on the Gira and
Yodda goldfields of Papua in the early
days of the century. The Common-
wealth Government had just taken over from
the Colonial Office, and there were dark
rumors of its intention to impose prohibition.
The miners held indignation meetings, and
a few desperate spirits even discussed the ad-
visability of secession to the German flag.
About this time some enterprising person
turned up with a book called “A Thousand
Recipes.” There was a brisk demand for it,
and a rush order for more copies went to
Sydney. Meanwhile the relative merits of
bananas, sugar-cane, taro, maize and other
basic materials for medical comforts were
furiously canvassed, and Klondyke Jimmy
blew himself up with a still he had built out
of a camp-oven and a rifle-barrel. Then the
Warden received a long official form asking
his opinion on prohibition, the possibility of
enforcing it, etc., and the blue form went
back with about a hundred foolscap appen-
dices attached, one of the most comprehen-
sive and erudite reports on the evils of pro-
hibition ever compiled.
THE STUPIDITY OF HUSBANDS.
“There you go again—putting the cat and the jug out together.
No wonder we are always short of milk for breakfast!”
“Bobo”: The advice of the president of
the Housewives’ Association to “eat wheat
as God sent it to us” suggests a frame of
mind condemnatory of all inventions and
innovations. It reminds me that I was teach-
ing in an out-back school during the war
when the Government decided to introduce
the daylight-saving scheme. In accordance
with my instructions I put the school clock
forward one hour, and explained the why of
it to my pupils. Though most of the young-
sters fell in with the new arrangement and
arrived bright and early the following morn-
ing, one couple, brother and sister, were an
hour late. My inquiry as to whether they
had forgotten the daylight-saving elicited a
quite respectful “No, miss, but Dad says we
gotter stick to God’s time, and never mind
the Guvmint’s.”
“Machete” recalls a strike -
The organisers of the British Transport Union are
reported to have gone on strike for a few hours
because their old president, Gosling, ex-M.P., wasn’t
given his old job bj' the executive committee. The
incident reminded me of a strike of magicians that
once occurred on. the Mamba River in Papua. A
prominent practitioner—Siega, of Ume —had been
awarded a stiff term of imprisonment. AVhen he was
sentenced he told the R.M. that his persecutors’ days
would be short in the land and full of sorrow. For
himself, no gaol or irons could hold him, and he
intended that night' to fly to the top of Mount Albert
Edward with the native sergeant of police, who had
arrested him, and hand him over to the Devil. Next
morning, to the surprise of most, including the
sergeant, nothing had happened. In fact, the sorcerer
did his full term. When he returned to his village
his old clients repudiated his claims to be a;
magician and his only remaining wife called him
the Binandele equivalent of a silly cuckoo. Then
it was that his union brethren rallied round him andi
refused to make magic until their brother was re-
instated in public opinion. It at once became im-
possible to bless one’s crops or curse one’s enemies.
Neighboring sorcerers stoutly refused to drive out
devils, or use pourri-pourri. It was Springtime too,
and love charms could not be got, while the spirits
of the dead howled up and down the village at night
time unchecked. Worse than that, perhaps, the
ladies of the village would come home from the
gardens in the evening with stories of how the
alligators had resumed their old trick of assuming the
guise of good-looking young men and trying to flirt
with them. A few days of this was enough. A depu-
tation waited on Siega with divers pigs, six dog-
tooth necklaces, several mats, two tomahawks and
a pair of new wives. After pressure, he reluctantly
consented to resume his seat as alderman, or its
Papuan equivalent, and the old order of things was
established again.

“The Dip”: Australian police roundsmen
are addicted to over-estimating the ability
and ingenuity of safe-blowers. Far too
many jobs are described as having been dar-
ingly and cleanly executed, and these glowing
accounts leave a lot of people with the im-
pression that every man operating is a master
in his crooked craft. As a matter of fact,
with a few notable exceptions the operators
are mere bunglers. About one in twenty is
able to say what quantity of “soup” should
be used for a door of a certain type, pres-
sure and weight. They don’t know when to
use only a little, or when a big charge is
necessary. The expert has these matters
worked out to a nicety ; you will never find
Mm hurling a safe 15 feet across the floor,
as happened recently in Newcastle. Instead,
he will charge the keyhole, set his fuse going,
pile a few clothes or books against the door
to deaden the noise, and then complacently
lean against the safe while the charge ex-
plodes.

“Harold Hardupp”: To the list of the
casual dead who go to their graves without a
name another might have been added but for

match. A man and his son were watching
the game when a newspaper that had evi-
dently been doing duty as a lunch-wrap blew
against them, and one paragraph, seeming
to stick out from the rest, attracted the
older man’s curiosity. When he had read it
lie went away and presently identified, in a
body found in the Yarra several days before,

headquarters his wife severed an artery and
was saved only by the promptitude and
surgical knowledge of the teacher. The
man wrote again, saying that, as the nearest
doctor was over a hundred miles away, he
realised the advantage of the teacher’s atten-
tion, and wished to withdraw his complaint.
As nothing further was heard of the matter
the authorities probably recognised that the
teacher wasn't a bad man for the job.

BALLAD FOR ALL TRUSTING DAMSELS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“About eight weeks after the marriage she dis-
covered that something was wrong, when one evening
the police came and took him away. She was shocked
to learn from his brother that her husband had
another wife living. At an interview with her hus-
band in Long Bay Gaol, she taxed him with duplicity,
and he admitted that he had another wife living.
‘When I come out,’ he said, ‘I will fix things up.’ ”
Suspicious I can’t say I ever have been,
Though every wife knows that man’s a deceiver.
And one hears, on occasion, that, after a scene,
A lady’s protector ’ll just up an’ leave her.
But I never considered Alphonso a crook,
Or guessed that he’d leave me without word or look,
Till one night when a John said to him “Come
along.”
’Twas then I suspected that something was wrong.
But it took more than that my affection to shake,
For I visited him in his place of detention,
And told him, with tears, that he’d made my heart
ache
By not giving me undivided attention.
But he stopped my complaints with a lover-like kiss
And cried “Just you wait till I get out of this.”
But the walls were too high and the bars were too
strong,
So I realised sadly that something was wrong.
Now, damsels confiding, take heed from my doom,
Be careful with everyone coming a-wooing.
A man’s bona fides off-hand don’t assume,
Till nothing is left you but sighing and rueing.
When they start their palaver just tell them out
straight:
“Avaunt! till ye bring me a cer-tif-i-cate
That you’ve no wives alive.” If they then make a
song
You can almost be certain that something is wrong.

CHERRIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Was it yesterday or the day before
The trees were shedding their blossom-snow
That windy noon? It can’t be more,
At the very most, than a week ago
Since wide by the tossing branches cast
The petals were flying thick and fast.
Yet here are the red, ripe cherries piled
In luscious masses in every shop:
What gramarie from the boughs beguiled
So swift the sweets of each ruby drop?
Were they formed by magic in one warm night
Under a Spring moon, golden-white?
A wizard crouched on an Eastern lawn
Shaped them deftly from dew and fire;
They came on a carpet genii-drawn,
Floating far above roof and spire;
And delicate hands no eye perceives
Hung them thickly amidst the leaves.

“Sixenate”: In a Perth divorce case the
petitioning husband produced a letter from
his wife in America suggesting a Reno
divorce. All he would have to do to make
the decree, applicable to the British Empire,
she explained, was to enter an appearance
and the job could be put through for 250
dollars. The husband, however, secured liis
decree on the ground of desertion, the Judge
adding that “no country would recognise a
divorce granted under the Reno conditions.”
But that doesn’t always matter. There are
one or two people in Australia who possess
(by British law) two wives apiece; but.
having taken the precaution to become
American citizens while they were qualifying
for a Reno divorce, they can’t be prosecuted
for bigamy.
“O. McKay M.” goes fossicking:—
No less than 933 Australian youths under 20 became
entangled in the matrimonial net during 1923-24, the
most immature catch being a lad of 15, whose
occupation—“roads and trams”—may have exposed
him to an excess of feminine allurements. The
youngest bride was 14; but a precocious infant of
12 contributed to the tale of ex-nuptial births. An
almost equally juvenile mother is labelled “food and
drinks” by a humorless statist. There were six
marriages of men in their early twenties with women
over 45, and one sexagenarian took unto himself a
maiden of 17. But the average age of bridegrooms
is about 29; and of brides some three years less.
Withal, 250 stout fellows of 65 and more mated;
and 187 ladies similarly advanced in years.

“Tarago”: Older soldiers had told me that
“Birdie” was a confirmed leg-puller, but
though I had met him off parade several
times and he had seldom failed to stop for a
chat, I could never rid myself of the sus-
picion that it was a matter of policy, and
that if you scratched the little General deep
enough you would find the stern British
Army disciplinarian. Then came the time
when I was liut-orderly, the first day out of
GETTING AN EDGE ON.
COLIN : “Oh, don’t put it that way—you are very blunt"
COLINDA : “Anyhow. I shall be sharp enough to cut you in future .”
the line, and word passed around that Birdie
would hold an inspection. Grumbling like
the rest. I set about getting chaos into some-
thing like order; after the company officer
had viewed my efforts I laid dowm by the
brazier for a much-needed rest. A drone of
voices woke me, and I saw the platoon stand-
ing to attention along the sides of the hut,
while Birdie, with the staff, held the floor.
Not knowing what to do under King’s Regu-
lations, I feigned to be still asleep, and won-
dered what I’d “fetch” when our C.O. found
time to deal with me. Our Commander-in-
Chief walked carefully around me several
times, addressed the men in a subdued tone,
and finally passed out, taking his retinue
with him. Bouncing to my feet I told all
and sundry what I thought of them for not
waking me. “Struth!”. said a tired voice,
“how could we when Birdie wouldn’t let
the C.O. do it? Anyway, ye wasn’t too bad
when yer stopped yer ——— snorin’.”
“F.A.”: There were some sharp contrasts
in Digger emotions over the casualties that
overtook their horses. One morning before
daylight, when our firing-battery waggons,
with the day’s supply of shells, were rum-
bling towards Zouave Wood, a Hun pip-
squeak struck the road 10 yards in front of
the leading team, and the near-side leader
dropped to his knees. “Git up, Steel!” the
driver yelled. “Steel” struggled to his hoofs
and stood to attention as if “feed-up” was at
hand, but a closer inspection showed that a
fragment had sliced a bit from his chest
and passed along
to near the stifle,
where a straight
incision gave a
clear view of the
poor beast’s inter-
nal machinery. The
n.c.o. ordered a
rifle from the lim-
ber, the driver
dividing his lan-
guage meanwhile
between invectives
for the Hun and
sobful eulogiums
for Steel. When
he was offered the
rifle to complete
the Hun’s job he
turned away with
a shudder, and,
whip in hand,
walked to the rear.
After the merciful
shot one of the
gunners brought the
driver’s “off” horse
back to him. He
took the rein with
a gulp, looked at
Steel’s mate, and
asked pathetically:
“What’s the blanky
use uv getting fond
of yous blanks?
Yer always git
knocked in the
end.” When we
got back to the
waggon line that
morning we struck
the other type of
horseman. There
were indications of
a recent disturb-
ance among the,
remnants of the
battery, and a
trumpeter explained
that the Hun had
been over. “Any
damage ?” ask e d
the n.c.o. “He got
a few horses, mine
among ’em. And I’d just finished groomin’
the blighter,” concluded the bereaved one
aggrievedly.
“Flicker” : The precipitation of a police-
man spoiled a nice little catch in Port
Adelaide recently. A hotel suspected of trad-
ing after hours was watched, and at last a
constable saw a man go into a convenience
leading on to the street and receive a bottle
of beer handed to
him from the hotel
yard. The John
rushed up, grabbed
the man and the
beer and carried
them both off in
triumph. When the
prisoner was
charged under the
S.A. Licensing Act
with “having car-
ried away liquor
from licensed pre-
mises during pro-
hibited hours,” his
solicitor blandly
pointed out that
the outhouse where
the beer had
changed hands was
part of the hotel
premises. The
accused had not
left the premises
when he was ar-
rested: it was the policeman who had car-
ried off the beer. The magistrate smiled
gently and agreed. -
“The Beak” : What about Appin? As the
tourist whirls from Sydney to -the Bulli Pass
and the South Coast road he passes through
,a tiny village with a pub. : It’s been tiny
and probably had a pub and:a church and a
small hayseed population for over a century.
When young Hamilton Hume, at the age of
17, set out on his adventures in 1814, he
took with him a blackboy, a native of Appin.
That ought to count. And when. 10 years
later, doubtless thinking there was luck in
Appin, he started on his overland trip to Vic-
toria, he packed his saddlebag or whatever
it was, and set out from Appin. That old
salt-tanned mariner Hovell joined him, and
they took a few assigned convicts with them
.—all from Appin. .There, was. no .local band
to blare them on their way, no nymphs to
strew confetti on the bush track as they
jogged on their nags out of the historic town.
Probably they had one or two at the local
pub, kissed some mothers and kids, and,
running their fingers through their beards,
set out on the great adventure. All this in
Appin and no fuss about it. They reached
Port Phillip, and camped at Geelong. On
the way, it is jotted down somewhere in a
diary, they passed through a place called
Mungabareen, and there they saw a river,
and Cap’n Hovell was so glad to see water
KISMET.
WIFE: “Well, you proposed to me seven times before I
accepted you."
HUBBY : “Yes, and then my luck gave out"
again that lie carved his name on a tree.
Hume didn’t bother about wood carvings,
for “Anpin,” where he had a grant of 300
acres of good land, was graven in his heart
deeper than the old skipper’s jack-knife could
cut into the bark. Just now they’re making
a fuss up at Mungabareen, or Albury, as, in
their silly way, they call it now, as if Hume
had ever bothered about the place. What
was Mungabareen to him or he to Munga-
bareen that he should worry over it? Yet the
silver-tongued Holman has been there to sing
of its grapes and its fair women. But what
about Appin? Are there no garlands for
Appin? Are there no bands for Appin—
historic Appin—glorious Appin, where you
get your midway beer on the road to Bulli?

“Ilasen”: He was an English naval sur-
geon who had not forgotten his bedside man-
ner, and it was his first visit to a North
Queensland port. The local sawbones took
him along on the morning round. Most of
the patients found his Oxford accent a little
puzzling, but liis urbanity remained unshaken
till they reached the house of Tomlinson.
Tomlinson was one of the most important
citizens, but had experimented in miscegena-
tion, and, though it was more than
your life was worth to mention it,
his offspring w T ere of a more-tlian-
slight coffee shade. As the youngest was
produced for examination the gallant seaman,
prepared to put everyone at ease with his
usual suavity, patted the youngster on the
head and spoke blandly. He broke off to
rub a shin with which the heavy boot of his
brother-practitioner had suddenly collided,
and turned to encounter an unmistakably
nasty look in the eyes of Mr. Tomlinson. Yet
all he had said was: “Jove, how sunburned
the little chap is, what?”

“R. 8.”: Mrs. Lance Rawson very properly
discounts the lost women of the Douglas
Mawson. Almost certainly the Douglas
Mawson was smothered in a cyclone and
sank where it struck her. A tame journalist,
discovering Boorooloola about 50 years after
its foundation, gave the other yarn a kick
along; and another assistant to believers in
it is the fact that the owners of the vessel
are liable for damages to certain relatives of
the crew if the ship did not land its com-
pany ; and while there is doubt there may be
no payment of compensation. It is almost
impossible now to get a true story from the
abos. because the white-man’s journalistic
speculations have been mulga-wired. The
other day, at Camooweal, Queensland Minis-
ter for Mines Alf Jones had a talk with a
Territorial abo., as thus:—
Jones: You been knowem two-feller white Mary
belonga ship? .
Abo.: Dullas Mawson that one'. Yowi. 1 been
knowem.
Jones; That one two-feller white Mary been stop.
Abo.: Yowi. Him been hopalong blackfella.
Jones; Blackfella been good along that one,
Abo.: My word! Blackfella been good alonga two-
fella white Marys. Givem pish, giveni tchugar-bag.
Jones: How you know that one?
Abo.: That one Couriek been say sendem aeroplane.
Breakem plurry neck that one.
All that Australia is to get out of the wild
newspaper blither is undesirable publicity in
American and British newspapers. Already
the American press is printing the yarn, with
a new lie for every mile it travels.

“Akran” : Bendy, who had collected some
shrapnel in the back at Hamel, returned to
the Batt. after three months in Blighty.
“Strike me pink,” he said one night, “those
blanky women visiting hospitals in the Old
Dart are over the odds. Questions —they’re
all questions! One of them got me dead wild.
She seemed surprised at my being hit in the
back. ‘You must have been retreating,’ she
said. ‘Were they too strong for you?’ ‘No,
Mum,’ I said, ‘it was our blanky captain.
He said, “Well, boys, do or die.” And I
blanky well thought he said, ‘Do a guy.’ And
she believed it.”
* * * *
“Hamer”: The side-arguments on the
Yarra Bank are the most interesting. I
struck one obviously heated controversy just
in time to hear an anti-beer orator tell a
member of the opposition that if he was a
married man and father of a family he had
no right to drink at all. “Haven’t I?” re-
torted the other. “The drink bill in Victoria
is five pounds ten a head per annum, isn’t
it? Well, I’ve got six kids who aren’t old
enough, and a wife and ’er sister and
mother who don’t drink, and a sister of me
own who wouldn’t touch it if you was to pay
her. That makes 10 people I’ve got the
right to do the drinking for, and my share’s
£5O per hannum.” Satisfied that his logic
had clinched the argument, he spat com-
placently into the dust, and moved away to
let his crushed opponent wrestle with the

The ad. said that “a young Lady, 21, Lonely,
desires to correspond with male readers, other Parts.”
So far 270 mere males have responded to the appeal,
and 32 enclose photographs. A number forwarded
newspaper clippings to attest their social standing
or achievements in startlingly different walks of life.
One has received mention in connection with a
Band of Hope social ; another has figured prominently
as an amateur pug. ; a third had won a pair of
spurs in a hack race; a fourth recently lost a
valuable bull-terrier pup. Looks of hair were
plentiful. One poetic soul contributed a lyric or
two, and more than one Orlando quoted the classics
to substantiate his sincerity. One applicant enclosed
his only reference (he had been offsider to a
shearers’ cook) ; I can’t help thinking he was the
most sincere of all. A canny correspondent living
a mere 300 miles away suggested that the Lonely
young Lady should arrange to meet him at a half-

GARDEN SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Rich men, poor men, build your fences!
Granite piles or palings thin
At the most are but pretences;
Nought can lock a garden in.
Low walls, high walls nothing matter ;
What they hold I also hold.
Vines will climb and blooms will scatter
That I may, too, share the gold.
Tramping, camping down the highways,
All the gardens smile to me,
Throw me kisses from the byways,
Whisper color melody.
Mellow, yellow age shall find me
Sharing still the guerdons thrown ;
What though lie should stoop or blind me,
Still all this will be my own.
Vagrant, fragrant scents shall wander,
When my eyes no longer see;
And I’ll know each blosom yonder
With the sight of memory.
VICTORIA.

For the third consecutive year since the
reconstruction 22 years ago all of the co. s
capital was represented by tangible assets.
But the directors have no desire to maintain
that position, so there is to be another issue
of bonus scrip. The proposal is to recon-
struct the co. with a view to enlarging its
constitution and increasing its capital. To
that end 125,000 fully-paid 6i p.c. prefs. of
£1 each will he issued to take the place of
the present 6 p.c. prefs., and 375,000 fully-
paid £1 ordinaries to take the place of present
ordinaries, the issue to be three new for
every two old shares. The directors have
further informed shareholders that, after the
reconstruction has been completed, an offer
is contemplated of 125,000 ordinaries to
ordinary shareholders in proportion to their
holdings. The directors say they do not
expect that aggregate divs. will be increased
except to the amount of interest saved on
borrowed money. In 1915, just before ordi-
nary capital w T as doubled by the issue of
bonus scrip, the div. rate was 14* p.c., which
dropped to 8 p.c. on the doubled capital the
following year. Last year’s 20 p.c.—which
is 40 p.c. to old and not-so-old holders —may
be 10 p.c. next year. But, as on the last
occasion, it may creep up, in another nine
years, to 20 p.c., which would be equal—but
those dreams may be left to the shareholders.
Following are comparisons of balance-sheet
movements covering 10 years:—

Net assets.. £214,438 £290,746 £453,392 £457,203
As at September 30 the position was decid-
edly comfortable. There was a surplus of
liquid assets over liabilities of £65,942. equal
to more than half the pref. capital, and there
w r as, in addition, the £391,261 of property and
plant. The amount represented by machinery
must be viewed in the light of its profit-
earning power. The original papers which
gave the co. its title—the Herald and
Weekly Times —are -well established. To
these have been added eight or ten more:
and apparently a “pup” co. has been formed
to run still others, and the establishment of
these may eat into the profits of the parent
—for a time, at any rate. To that extent the
co.’s shares are slightly more speculative
than they were. To a rather greater extent
future profits may be affected by the com-
petition of the Sun. So far the directors
record that “despite the new evening paper,
the Herald circulation has increased.” But
it is probable that, if things were less flourish-
ing in Melbourne than they are at present,
the competition would show itself in de-
creased advertising; and it would be less
easy than it has been hitherto to reduce
expenses to correspond. In the past year
those outgoings—“salaries, general ex-
penses, etc.” —moved up to £76,496 from
£59,385 in the previous year. In view no
doubt of the contemplated share-issues, ordi-
nary shares are quoted at 595. After deduct
ins from the surplus of tangible assets an
amount equal to the £125,000 of pref. capital,
there remains about 225. per share tor
ordinaries.

The public is interested chiefly in the prcfs.
When the co. shifted its headquarters from
London, £150,000 of 7 p.c. cumulative were
raised in Australia to redeem debentures of
£131.625 held in England. These prefs. call
for £10,500 p.a.. and last year’s disclosed
profits w r ere sufficient to have paid that
amount seven times over, and still left a
little. Ordinary shares are largely held by
Robert Reid and Co., and three directors
of that house are on the Board. These share-
holders have not only had a handsome return,
but, in addition, profits left in the business
have been so great as to permit of two bonus
distributions. The first w r as a 33 p.c. issue
four years ago, and another issue was made
last year. These issues in no way affect the
prefs.’ security; and as will be seen pre-
sently they have the backing of over 70s. of
tangible assets (net! for every 20s. at risk.
The amount involved in the last gift to ordi-
naries was £69,608, wdiich was effected
“partly out of general reserves and partly
out of provisions made previously and not
now- required.” As general reserves contri-
buted only £45,459, the balance —£24,149 —
must have been lifted out of some hiding-
place ; which fact is of interest as showing
that the disclosed profits, big as they are,
have not represented the total net win-
nings. From the profits of the last two
years £5OOO p.a. has been given to the staff
pension fund. Balance-sheet movements
since the closing year of the English co. in-
dicate the progress:—

Of the ordinary capital more than two-fifths
has been provided out of accumulated profits,
so that the 15 p.c. div. means a return of
25 p.c. Other balance-sheet movements were
unimportant. Cash increased by £45.138
and premises were in the books at £12,000-
odd more, and that item will expand during
the current term. The trading returns were
the biggest in the history of the co.; but
although the published accounts are not in-
formative on the matter, the directors indi-
cated that expenses likewise touched record
dimensions.

A substantial deficit was changed into sub-
stantial reserves in 1923 by writing up pro-
perty, Ilardie and Gorman having valued
the co.’s headquarters at £43,375 more than
was paid for them. Subsequently they were
valued by the same firm at “a marked in-
crease” ; but very wisely nothing more in the
way of writing up was done. No doubt the
purchase was a good one; but it is just as
well for trading cos. to i'emember that Pessi-
mism isn’t senior partner in any real estate
business in Sydney just at present—or any
other Australian capital city, for that matter.
The reserves of this co. have to be view-ed
with this in mind. Whether last year’s high
div. was warranted depends largely on the
stocktaking. Following the usual custom the
co.’s auditors made arrangements with
McMurtries, the boot warehousemen, to in-
spect. Their report is to the effect that “the
stocks at all shops are very clean, of good
value, saleable and well bought.” Consider-
ing the scale on which the co. operates, there
should be little doubt as to the freshness of
stocks: last year turnover w r as £650,000, and
as at the close of last year stocks stood at
£141,143, it looks as though the shelves have
to be replenished every few months. Still
that doesn’t necessarily mean a complete
clearance; and it is the remnants that have
made trouble before to-day. However, the
setback of 1921, following the slump in
leather and footwear, appears to have been
left behind; and if the eo. can’t make a
big profit on such a turnover something will
have to be very wrong.. The directors look
forward to the current year to show record
figures, and they place their faith in this and
improved business methods to lift profits
higher: they certainly ought to be higher
on a turnover of this size. Liabilities, in-
cluding overdraft of £73,479 “secured by a
mortgage on freeholds,” amount to a very solid
£140,546 ; and, as that looks a bit like over-
trading, the directors propose to issue the
20.000 unallotted shares, making capital
£lOO,OOO. The amount in freeholds
(£100,101) is, of course, heavy, and that to
some extent excuses the size of the liabili-
ties. The market view of the shares is
b 18s. 6d.. s 19s. 3d., despite the big div. and
the directors’ anticipations of a record
balance next time. But probably the mili-
tant methods which produce the big turnover
are responsible for the stock not being very
fashionable. There can be no question about
the management’s energy: last year it opened
two new stores —one under the Joe Gardiner
sign and another under one of the firm’s
fancy titles.

The D.I.C. celebrated its fortieth birthday by
disclosing record profits and distributing a
record amount in divs. The div. rate was
not as good as in 1919 and 1920. but capital
now includes £59,000 of bonus scrip. Share-
holders received their customary 21 p.c.
bonus on purchases, but what it amounted to
in cash was not indicated. Gross profits in-
creased from £242,088 to £249,092, or £7004
on the year, whereas expenses went up only
by £1909, which accounts for the healthy
profit. In 1908 gross profits were £93,615.
By 1914 they had grown to £116,541. touch-
ing £184,706 in 1920. The co. was founded
in Dunedin by Bendix Hallenstein in
’B4. capital being £27,276. It had grown
into a thriving concern when, near its
21st birthday, a fire reduced its Wel-
lington premises and stock to ashes, and,
not long’ after, its Christchurch branch
went up in smoke. Those were the
last of its troubles until the 1921 slump,
when it shared in the almost general loss, and
had to draw on reserves. Four years ago
the co. extended to Wanganui, and purchased
also all the shares of a business in the Maori-
land capital. In 1923. faced with the neces-
sity of rebuilding its Dunedin headquarters,
it purchased the stock and lease of one co.
in order to carry on business during con-
struction. and then changed its mind and
shifted shop to a second business in a good
position, which it purchased. Following is
a comparison of balance-sheet movements
over a ten-year period :■ —

Investments and
cash . . 6,225 176,115 67,035 48,790
Stocks increased as a result of the two
Dunedin purchases, but prompt steps were
taken to reduce them, and the directors
hope to have them back to normal next year.
“Sundry creditors,” £162,258 —doubtless
trade debts—comprise most of the liabilities;
they are substantial, despite the eo.’s big
annual turnover. Sundry debtors are
£88,347, which isn’t out-of-the-way in the
circumstances of the co. The smaller the city
the greater the tendency for business to be
on a credit basis, until, in the case of a
country town, even a box of matches goes
down on the bill, especially if, as in M.L.,
most of the customers depend on the produce
of the land, which is, as a rule, harvested
only once a year. Investments of £39,655,
which the balance-sheet suggests is chiefly
in 44 p.c. Government stoek, indicates easy
finance, but helps a little to pull down the
earning power of funds. The co. has its
own premises. They are befitting the co.’s
standing and have eaten up much capital;
and, although that means security, it
likewise means more modest returns.
They appear in the books (“warehouse, fix-
tures and plant”) at a quarter million, and
ought to be worth more than that. Floating
debt and mortgages total £216,993. Liquid and
semi-liquid assets (including the £39,655 of
Government stock and other investments)
amount to £468,694; which leaves sufficient
to cover the quarter-million of pref, capital,
£ for £ and a few pence over. There are, in
addition, the fixed assets running to a
quarter-million.

*5 p.c. on prefs. and 4 p.c. on ordinaries.
The low cost of importing-—75 p.c. of the
value of articles entering the Commonwealth
can be anything but British and yet hold
a good title to Australian preference—lias
put the brake on everything in our textile
industry from the scours to the looms. The
immediate result to this co. has been a drop
from 12 p.c. to 4 p.c. in the div. rate and
£127,678 locked up in the storeroom. Of
this amount £41,435 is in raw materials, the
balance in woollens and worsteds from looms
that now go slower because forward con-
tracts have failed and the storeroom won’t
hold any more. In addition the night shift
has lost its job. And as competition from
local mills in the wool-sale rooms is poor,
there doesn’t seem to be much hope of these
men getting their jobs back again at an
early date. Also tightness of the money
market and a 39 p.c. rise in. the average
price of greasy wool during the 15)22-23 sales
have had their effect on forward contracts
and on costs. Australian mills pay higher
wages and work shorter hours than their
overseas competitors. And they can’t reap
any advantage from exchange operations
when such advantages are to be reaped. Also
they haven’t any cheap Buenos Ayres cross-
bred or Mazamet slipes for blending. All
these factors tell when reduced to the common
denominator of price per yard of the fin-
ished article.

Against the £91,140 of liabilities—including
bank overdraft, £56,637, and £34,414 to credi-
tors, mostly for wool —there are £143,233 of
liquid and semi-liquid assets. Manufactured
materials amount to £86,243, which is
£65,848 more than in 1922. Raw materials
and stores total £41,435, which is £11,481 higher
than the 1922 figure. Still, they are probably
worth even more at this date, the trend of
wool being still upwards. In the last two years
£50,000 of new capital has been brought into
the business, with £2144 of share premiums.
Additions to plant and machinery have
absorbed £39,403 and £4755 has been added
to buildings. Some of the co.’s machinery
was purchased on a high market, but sub-
stantial amounts have since been written off
the original cost. Textiles from Britain
came forward in the volume of 7,500,000 sq.
yds. of woollens and 1,500,000 sq. yds. of
worsteds during the first six months of this
year, in total more than double the pre-war
volume. And there are prospects of a heaviei
rush before the tariff alteration in April
next. It looks as though shareholders’ funds
will be poor dividend-earners for a while at
any rate.

At the Amalgamated Zinc meeting W. L.
Baillieu and Monty Cohen told impatient
and inquisitive shareholders that if experts
Avery and Benjamin testify that the Speck s
forest growth will easily make good news-
print they intend to have a try at it. But.
they want John Bull in as a partner: pro-
bably to supply cash and furnish technical
skill. But imported “technical skill” isn't
always best. At Broken Llill a Yank came
on the scene first for the Zinc Corporation,
and the co. didn’t do great things till after
lie left. At the Amalgamated Zinc it was
only when Gepp got on the job that the
way out was discovered. Ever since then
most Collins House ventures have had the
protecting arms of Australian experts around
them. Even at Yarra Falls and Richmond,
to which Bradford has supplied one or two of
its best wool-men. the Robinson pair are
conspicuous. Baillieu is unusually resentful
of the press criticism which has gone on
over Avery's programme for newsprint, but
that doesn't mollify investors who bought
Amalgamated Zinc scrip on a balance-sheet
basis and expected profits from a wind-
ing up.

For B. H. Block 14 to come out in _ its
little pink cover from Brandon’s office with-
out its old room-mate, Block 10. shows that
the world is moving on. Voss Smith is still
in control, and his last six months’ run was
21,300 tons, all going to the Prop, mill for
treatment. The ore was pretty low-grade—•
12f p.c. lead, 9foz. silver and 10J p.c. zinc
-—and work at the mill wasn’t cheap, so only
£13,440 working profit could be earned. Tak-
ing mining and milling costs at £67,752,
nearly 655. a ton was mopped up. Alec
Campbell hopes for better things, both in
the grade of the ore and in treatment charges.
Net profits for the six months’ run were
£10.248. The co.’s debt to Port Pirie is
only whittled down from £8543 to £6085, but
concentrates and ore in hand tot up to
£30,000, and cash and odd items represent
another £2500. The items have to be set
against £23,000 of liabilities. Campbell’s
view is that if lead keeps up until products
can be sold the bailiff may yet be avoided.
Since P. T. O’Connor went west Mt.
Jasper, although lost to sight, has been to
shareholders very dear. John A. Mills lives
as chairman to tell that another change has
taken place at the mine, W. Kingston having
been put in charge. The Jasper copper section
lingers on, while the Heazlewood silver-lode
has been in and out. Its last feat was to
be cut out by a crosscourse. When found
again it only bulged into a sin. seam. That
isn’t much to brag about, but Mills will duly
explain the painful circumstances when
shareholders are on the mat.
Memories of Coolgardie boom days have
been revived by reported new finds at Dunns-
ville and Mt. Burgess (W.A.). It was. at
the former place that Duun found a rich out-
crop and called it the Wealth of Nations.
About 10,0(X)oz. were quickly obtained, and
Alex. Forrest, one of Dunn's backers, hurried
from Perth to view the discovery. A lOOoz.
nugget was unearthed just about the time of
his arrival, and diggers came from far and
near to view the find. Forrest passed round
the nugget and waited for its return. But,
alas! it never returned, and no threats or
entreaties could bring it back. Dunn and
his backers sold for a big sum to an English
co., which soon found it had bought a dud.
Mt. Burgess was also rich on the surface, but,
like Dunnsville, it petered out at a shallow
depth, and, after paying a small div., the
Scottish co. which bought it from the pros-
pectors, went bung.
* * * *
Attempts are being made to raise some old
Coolgardie mines from the dead. The list
includes a few from which a fair quantity
of gold was obtained, and others which, after
a small crushing or two, had nothing left to
treat. The drawback? to several of these
old shows were narrow, rapidly-dipping,
short-lived shoots and hard ground. Interest
in them was sustained for a time by picked
returns, but tin; end in most cases came
early. It is hardly likely that any of them
will improve in deeper ground, but some may
be made to furnish an occasional crushing.
* * * *
Two Adelaide cos., the Mararoa and Emu,
have hopes of boring their way to wealth at
Wiluna (W.A.). Mararoa has already done
some drilling, and is now doing some more
in ground described as extremely favorable.
Emu’s supporters reckon it is almost certain
to strike something, but the market doesnt
hold that opinion. Recently a bore on the
Gwalia Consolidated struck values ranging
from £1 to £4B per ton over a big width, and
a London syndicate, previously mentioned on
this page, is now doim me work to con-
firm them.
* * * • *
Bullfinch Prop. (W.A.) has decided to call
up 2s. of the 4s. liability on its 7<, <2.
tributing shares. This will provide £(U»,
and most of the money will be used to de-
velop the old Gladsome and Sand Queen
mines at Comet Vale, on which the co. re-
cently took an option. The co.’s old mine at
Bullfinch is being worked with varying re-
sults by tributors.
* * * *
Edna May Central (W.A.) had an inde-
pendent report made on the Mistletoe leases,
Meekatharra, and, as a result, will probably
abandon its option. The show belongs to a
class of rich dabs occasionally met with in the
West, which invariably cut out at shallow
depth and on which no co. should waste
money.
Blair Athol (Q.) produced only 4570 tons
of coal during October, split up between six
mines. The Blair Athol Co. is working only
the No. 2 mine at present, No. 3 is let on
tribute and No. 1, where the open cut is,
remains idle. The open-cut scheme is down
and out, temporarily at least, for lack
of cash. The cut has absorbed more capital
than was estimated, presumably owing to a
miscalculation of the amount of overburden
to be removed. Mt. Morgan trade, the loss
of which was a nasty blow to Blair Athol,
was responsible for an output from the
Dawson Valley Colliery of 557 S tons during
October.
* * * *
The Finger Print, a comparatively recent
discovery and the most promising gold show
on the Etheridge (N.Q.). has got its battery
in working order and is starting on 500 tons
of ore already at grass. The party expects to
clean up not less than 1 OOOoz. from this lot.
Prospecting on this field has received more
attention during 1924 than for years past,
and the good crushing from this mine will
give it a further impetus. Several new silver-
lead shows, with' ores carrying a little gold,
have been opened up during the last couple
of months.
* * * *
After some preliminary work, Mt. Jack-
son. Etheridge, started operations last month.
During the last couple of months F. W.
Cuthbert shipped 263 tons of surface ore
to Chillagoe for treatment, and got the follow-
ing returns : Gold, 120 oz. ; silver, 1231 oz.; lead,
32 tons r gross value, £1440. A silver-lead
combination carrying just under lOdwt. of
gold is a fairly rare bird, and Cuthbert is
most optimistic as to his future while the
present market prices hold. He will probably
ship a zinc concentrate as well.
* » * »
The Niglitflower lode, Chillagoe (Q.), is
being prospected. The Government, after
waiting to see how others got on, lias pushed
down a shaft to 90ft. on the State lease, but
without striking sulphides in mass, although
the 3ft. to 4ft. of gossany formation looks
promising for values lower down. So far,
assay values have been low. The Argentum,
which is the principal lease on the line, is
producing good ore from the 60ft. stopes,
and 56 tons sent away last month returned
24500 z. silver and 17 tons lead. Most of it
was a mixture of sulphide and carbonates,
and the average of 440 z. silver is very satis-
factory. The lode is proving zincy.
* * * *
After a recent visit to the field:—
Mt. Isa Prop, lias exercised its options on the Ibus,
Out on Her Own, Even Break, Argyle and Durban
Angel, and the last payment is to be made at the
end of July, 1925. Ibus No. 1 shaft is down 150 ft.
in payable values from surface; No. 2 is down
100 ft. with equal results; and No. 3 is being sunk
to cut the Frecheville lode to the north of the
main outcrop. The outcrop lias been sampled for
over 110 ft. of width. It is continuous through the
lease from the Black Star to the Ibus north boundary.
The Prop, has installed the first power winches on
the field, and from now on will make better pro-
gress, sinking with two shifts. Galena veins in the
carbonate assay into the hundreds of ounces silver,
but the little flow of water in the Black Star shaft
is taken by the Prop, management to be local; and
it is doubtful whether sulphides will be met
under 350 ft. The Out on Her Own No. 2 shaft
has carried the Black ltock lode from the grass
and shows high-grade ore to the underlie shaft
bottom at 124 ft. One shoot of rich ore shows
above the shallow tunnel drive of the Out on Her
Own, and this is being broken for shipment. It
is expected to bulk 50 p.c. lead and 50oz. silver.

Dr. Wade, the petroleum expert, is in
Queensland, reporting for the Federal Gov-
ernment as to oil possibilities. He is giving
attention chiefly to the Roma-Blackall dis-
tricts, but will also visit Beaudesert and
Tewantin. The A.O.C. bores at Beaudesert
proved disappointing, as bdtli ran into a
great thickness of volcanic rock at a few
hundred feet.
* * * *
Ilerberton (N.Q.) tin returns for October
were up to £6400, with 70 p.c. concentrates
touching £l6O. The Arbouin crushing was
small, only 415 tons for 10 tons of ’trates;
but this was due to a shortage of water, and
since then the dams have been replenished.
The old Vulcan turned out: 100 tons—its
pockets are seemingly inexhaustible. The
Boundary weighed in with a rich lot of
dressed ore. 211 tons averaging £.‘>o per ton.
Great Northern is still very quiet, but there
is a promising development in the lower
levels. Work is being started on the Good
Friday again. ,

Randolph Bedford replies :
Anonymous “Shareholder” says that I am “fond
of making bald statements and denials, but never
a tittle of evidence does he bring along in support.”
X don’t know what a “tittle” is, but if it’s very
small evidence, the anonymous gentleman has practi-
cally a monopoly of it. Where’s the use of the man
charging the reduction in coal costs at Townsville
to merely differences of freight ? Before freights rose
with other post-war charges, Newcastle coal was
03s. at Townsville, and now it -is less than half— •
a reduction benefiting not only State railways but
private industrial enterprise. The other “tittle” of
evidence is an invitation that I shall go to Collins-
ville on the off-chance of hearing “miners generally”
repeat some statement that the anonymous gentleman
says that he heard them say at some time unspecified !
“Anonymous’s” quarrel is based on a hatred of
public ownership, which has saved and is saving
much money to both publicly-owned railways and
privately-owned industries. The meek altruism of
Australian private coal-owners is too well known for
“Shareholder’s” spleen to be taken for anything
but what it is.
* * * *
Vegetable Creek continues to get poor re-
sults at the Cherry leases, Ardlethan
(N.S.W.). The last four weeks' production
was 11.7 tons dried concentrates from 237
tons. The October run gave 12.75 tons
from 191 tons ore, and September 16.1 tons
from 190. The latest report explains why
shares tumbled below 4s. at the end of last
week and still look sick. On the eastern pipe
stoping is on pyritic ore of poorer quality;
the western pipe has contracted, and sinking
is on “fair quality stone”; main shaft sunk
6ft. 6in. to 30ft. in hard granite; at the
battery shaft sinking in formation without
change. All distinctly unpromising.
Shareholders in Crown, Mudgee (N.S.W.),
could hardly have been overjoyed when the
first crushing of 350 tons panned out 1440 z.
The tonnage was less than half of that pro-
mised in official forecasts; and the same
people are now prophesying SOO tons for the
run till Christmas. Tom Waters has found
that he is not at the Queen Cross Reef,
where his estimates of tonnage and yield
were usually bettered by the mill. Eight
’weights, though only one-third of prospectus
figures, would not be so bad if the 10-head
mill were to escape from its attack of slow-
itis. a disease that has eaten the heart out
of N.S.W. quartz-reefing. Forecasts are fal-
sified with almost painful regularity, but the
prophets come up smiling every time with the
same old excuses.

Bribbaree ,(N.S.W.) reporjts haying lifted
2400 z. amalgam off the plates from 100 tons
of ore crushed and 60oz. from a further 20
tons. Milling will be continued till another
130 tons have been put under the stamps.
Stoping at two different points is proceeding
on 12in. to 15in. of “good ore.” The figures
indicate that Bribbaree should get about
30dwt. to the ton from the first parcel milled ;
but it represents the gatherings of about 18
months, and stopes a foot thick can not. be
prolific suppliers for future parcels. There
are 80,000 shares to feed.

The little Sutherland Lode Development
Co., formed to develop leases at Kiandra

Sutherland himself went along a couple of
months ago to give a hand, but struck such
vile weather that he could do nothing.

Austral Malay Tin has been advised that
prospecting has been completed on a small
area about 60 miles from Taiping, F.M.S.
The material is estimated at seven million
cubic yards, value just over -Jib., depth 12ft.
to 27ft. A.M.T. directors will probably offer
the land to the Kampong Kamunting Co.,
which could shift one of its dredges from
Taiping after its own area lias been ex-
hausted. Meantime action is held up until
full reports arrive.

The directors of South Lucknow (N.S.W.)
in announcing the last call of 14d. state
that most of the money will be spent on
battery equipment for treating ore-bodies
already proved. Development work to date
indicates that from four to five thousand tons
are available for stoping. The actual value
is still doubtful, but a seven-ton parcel of
picked ore from a spur well away from the
contact returned something near 2oz. per
ton. The co. now claims that it is on the
contact where bonanzas occurred on the old
field. So far nothing startling has been dis-
closed. but the spur bodies are estimated
to yield :J>out 12dwt. per ton. This is in
keeping with old Lucknow, but it yet re-
mains to he proved that there are bonanzas
like those which made old Lucknow famous.
The available tonnage of 12dwt. ore should
keep things going with a battery on the job,
and obviate further calls, but a bonanza or
two are necessary if shareholders are to re-
ceive anything for the £lO,OOO or more
already sunk in this elusive venture.

All 12 members of the newly-formed Allan-
Peacock Coalition (Vic.) were born in the
Cabbage Garden. Geelong was responsible
for two (Richardson and McDonald). Down-
ward saw the light in Melbourne eight years
before responsible government was estab-
lished in 1856. Lancefield cradled Premier
Allan, but Kyabram reared and takes full
credit for him. The downiest bird of the
dozen is Peacock, who is having his 14th
bout in a Cabinet, and has more than 19
years of Ministerial experience behind him.
Professor Strong, formerly of Melbourne
but now of Adelaide Uni., is to spend next
year in Europe,
bringing himself up
to date in literary

Professor ARCHIE
STRONG.
.1. M. Power, the Labor M.L.C. who was
generously elected to the Senate at a joint
meeting of both (mostly Nationalist) N.S.W.
Houses the other day, started with a horse
and dray on a Sydney City Council job, and
got out of that. Then he acquired a taxi-cab
and got out of that. Next he took a tobacco-
nist shop and got out of that. He started
politics by tackling Jack Osborne, M.L.A.,
for his Labor selection, and just missed that.
Then he tackled veteran Jack West, M.H.R.,
for his, and just missed that. His next start
was against Jack Birt, M.L.A., for the
Paddington Labor selection; he just missed
that. What he didn’t miss, however, was a
place amongst the crew that submarined the
Labor Government at the 1916 Conference.
He was secretary of the Industrial section
formed ‘at that time, and this kept him in
the picture. He was appointed to the Leg.
Council four years ago, and has since managed
to get in his “spruik” about most things.
S. Aus. pastoralist Andrew Smith, father
of Keith and the late Ross, died on Novem-
ber 18 in his 73rd year. Peter Waite en-
gaged him in 1879 for his Paratoo station,
which then extended from Terowie to the
S. Aus. border. From ISB7 till liis death
he managed the Mutooroo portion of the run.
Smith was a noble Scotsman who built up
a waterless region into productive wool
country carrying more than 139,000 sheep.
Dead in Adelaide, at 73, Tom Williams,
who ceased to be Chief Inspector of Stock
last year after nearly a half-century’s ser-
vice. In 1874 he entered the Police Depart-
ment as a trooper, and got his vast knowledge
of stock and country while serving in the
Far North. He became Chief Inspector in
1895, and thereafter his treatises on stock
diseases became world known.
All or most of the 12 members of the new
Allan-Peacock Ministry in Victoria are fairly
comfortable, but none are wealthy. Eight
are farmers of some sort; one is a med., who
lias become so infatuated with politics that
he is willing to risk a Collins-street practice
over the precarious business; one a solicitor,
more industrious than brilliant, with an am-
bitious wife; one a companies’ manager with
whom office has become a habit, and who is
always better as navigating lieutenant than
as admiral; and one a provincial-town agent.
Nine of the 12 were in previous Govern-
ments. Downward (76) is the oldest, and
Col. Bourchier (43) the youngest. Besides
Bourchier, Argyle and Eggleston helped in
the Big Scrap.
Glasgow Weekly Herald says that Billy
Hughes was in turn “ordinary sailor, scrub-
cleaner, cook for timber-getters and cattle
shearer.” Now we know where the cx-Prime
Minister got the bullswool that he has so
often pulled over the people’s eyes.
Of the 14 members comprising the S. Aus.
Parliamentary Labor party in 1593 seven
are dead, including the first three leaders —
.T. Abel McPherson. Ted Batchelor (after-
wards State and Federal Minister) and Tom
Price (later Premier). The other four were
Senator Bob Guthrie. Dick Hooper, Dick
Wood and Frank Ilourigan. The seven sur-
vivors are Minister A. A. Kirkpatrick and
ex-Speaker F. W. Coneybeer (the only two
of the lot now left in Parliament). ex-Sena-
tor D. M. Charleston, W. A. Robinson, ex-
Federal Ministers Alec Poynton and W. O.
Archibald, and Ivor MacGillivray. MacGil-
livray is oldest (84) and Coneybeer youngest
(65).
The Tichborne romance may be said to
have opened in 1866. when an immense and
unlettered butcher of Wagga (N.S.W.) re-
vealed the news that he was Roger Tich-
borne. a wealthy baronet, who had been sup-
posedly lost at sea in 1854, and that he had
pursued the retail meat industry in the inter-
val for the romance of the thing. It was
supposed to have ended when the same claim-
ant came out of gaol in 1884. He died long
since, after admitting himself to be a mfere
Orton, in whose family butchering was heredi-
tary. But his daughter, who must be an
old woman by now, set up as an heiress, and
has apparently chased the dream of greatness
ever since, for the other day she was bound
over to cease rushing at the present Tich-
borne with violent language. The hunting
of visions is not uncommon, as witness
Percy R. Meggy, still hoping for Freetrade
and Single Tax: and the Naundorffs, who
have skirmished for the French crown since
1838, on the plea of their alleged descent
from the murdered infant of Louis XVI.
But the Ortons are in a category of their
own.
“Toby C.”: Some weeks ago a Muscovy
duck-egg with an eight-inch girth was de-
posited in the back yard of a Warwick (Q.)
hash-house. No wonder Prime Minister
Bruce didn’t pay Warwick a visit during
his recent tour of Queensland.
Thomas Januarins Smith, the man who
turned up at the A.L.P. ballot-box inquiry
in Sydney, hurled a few uncomplimentary
remarks at Theodore and then left before the
Bananaland Premier could get his breath, has
the meek appearance of a theological student,
and is usually a quiet-spoken person
addicted to poetry and the works of W. B.
Yeats and Lady Gregory. Smith was born
at Dublin in 1890 and received his
education in the North of England.
Homing to Sydney 13 years ago he
first worked as a window-dresser, but
ill health drove him out back, where he be-
came a rouseabout and an organiser for the
Armidale branch of the A.W.U. In 1907
he defeated .T. .1. Morrish for King, but. was
outed in 1920, when proportional representa-
tion included his seat in the Sydney elec-
torate. In 1921 Jack Storey appointed him
to the Upper House, and he was the young-
est member that sat among the greybeards.
He is one of the A.L.P.’s best plat-
form speakers, and in private life conducts
a real-estate business. His second Christian
name comes from St. Januarins, the patron
saint of Naples, who celebrates his birthday
on the same day as Smith.
Keane, the new Labor member for Essen-
don in tin' Vie. Assembly, can take care of
himself. While he was talking Deany was
interjecting in a provocative tone. At last
Keane told the Speaker in a confidential sort
of way that when he was a kid he got such
a lecture from his mother for shooting tom-
tits that he never fired at them now. The
House grinned, and there was a ghost of a
smile around the 3‘ of John Bowser, the
bewigged man in the hair.
Charlie Glover has been returned un-
opposed for another term as civic head of
Adelaide. lie is an old P.A.C. boy, who
was articled to Fauldings, the wholesale
chemists: but he tired of drugs and went
into the stock and share business, which lie
found very profitable. Handing out play-
grounds to children is one of his hobbies.
DR. R. S. ELLERY, the central figure in
the inquiry into the administration of
Kew Asylum.
“Sim” Barnard, just dead in Adelaide at
SO, was a great sportsman in liis day, as well
as an auctioneer. He was secretary to the
infant S.A.J.C. in 1880, and A. O. Whiting-
ton learned his business in Barnard’s office.
As an owner, Totalisator and Dirk Hatterick
were about his best.
The Reaper made a noticeable gap in the
ranks of the priesthood when he visited Gee-
long last week and cut down Archpriest
McKenna, in his 81st year. One of the oldest
members of the R.C. hierarchy, McKenna
was a picturesque figure about the streets
of the seaside city. He came to Geelong in
the late ’nineties as assistant to Archdeacon
Slattery of the “free and flashing sword,”
and on the latter’s death succeeded to his
job. The Archpriest was built on a big-
scale, though he ran to breadth rather than
height. lie was an excellent raconteur;
liis laugh had something of Homeric quality
in it, and no gale that ever blew could have
drowned his booming voice.
Padre T. McKeon, who died at the Caul-
field Military Hospital last week, was one
of the many and too often unconsidered vic-
tims of gas attacks in France, where he
served with the A.I.F. He had been in hos-
pital fcr some time, and a couple of weeks
ago his condition became so critical that the
doctors said transfusion was the only hope.
When Archbishop Lees appealed to the
padre’s parishioners for volunteers, no less
than 10 offered themselves, four of them
being women, but the sacrifice did not save
him. He was only 34, and leaves a widow
and two young children.
“FY7” : The British public has been rather
surprised to learn that the post-war sums
of money vot'd by Parliament to Haig,
Beatty and other distinguished sailors and
soldiers are no longer paid over to the
grantee: they are to be held in trust for three
generations, only the interest being paid
meanwhile to the grantee and his heirs. One
of the reasons suggested for the change is
that Lord Wolseley got rid of his Egyptian
grant in the ’eighties by unfortunate specu-
lations in Australia. In the early days of
the Wolseley shearing-machine, it was com-
monly supposed that the then famous Sir
Garnet’s money was behind his brother, the
pastoralist inventor. The machine took a
long time to establish and perfect, and the
writer never heard that the inventor had
made a fortune out of it. Probably some of
the cash won at Tel-el Kcbir vanished in this
other battle.
Another of the Tyson clan went out when
Isabella Sheil died in Sydney the other day.
For nearly half a century she had been a
central figure in St. Mary’s Cathedral activi-
ties, and some years ago the Pope decorated
her with a Cross of Leo. Born at Appin
(N.S.W.) she is survived by her 91-year-old
mother, a sister of late millionaire Jimmy.
Crossed the border, Edward Alwortli
Merewether, a noted denizen of Coalopolis.
The eldest son of E. C. Merewether, for-
merly superintendent of the A. A. Co., he
followed up the engineering classes at the
University, finally taking out his B.E. de-
gree. However, he left machinery for the
land, taking on the successful management
of the Merewether estate and the building up
of the Merewether suburb. In between
being chairman of directors of the Newcastle
Gas Co., and director of the Newcastle and
Hunter River Steamship Co., he helped to
found the Newcastle Jockey Club and lent
a hand to all clean sport, being president of
the local cricket association and the New-
castle Golf Club. He was 62 at the end.
The flags came half-way down the other
day for Cap’n John Hunter Sundgren, who
for 20 out of his 50 years of seafaring worked
along the north coast of N. S. Wales. In
1014 he was chief officer of the packet Katung
which landed the first troops at Gallipoli
from Alexandria.
Uangdon Bonython, now in London, has
been handed the diary of James Henderson,
an early S. Australian explorer, who was one
of Captain Prome's surveyors. The donor
is Major Henderson, a son of James, and lie
has also presented a portfolio of sketches of
early-day incidents in S.A. Both will find a
home in the Adelaide Public Library.
Railway employees in the Speck don’t always
have to wait till somebody dies before they get
promotion. Lately the appointment of C.
Miscamble as chief has hastened several re-
tirements. C. C. Nairn, chief engineer for
existing lines, has made way for F. P. St.
Hill, and A. J. Winterson, secretary of the
department, has left a gap filled by A. J.
Rollins. Other perches well up the tree have
gone to A. W. Wherrett (resident engineer)
and A. B. Rapp (controller of stores). Mis-
camble is saving expenditure by amalgamat-
ing jobs and cutting out or re-arranging train
trips.
M. P. Considine, the ex-Federal member,
is now secretary of the Bi-oken Hill branch
of the Workers’ Industrial Union, which em-
bodies most underground men. He is finding
ample scope for his internationalism. Owing
to the large number of foreigners working
on the mines, the union has issued a pam-
phlet of instructions in three languages, in-
cluding (under protest) English. Inter-
nationalism isn’t the same lion at home,
however, as it is abroad. P. Lamb, the pre-
sident of the local branch, who attended tbe
famous Moscow conference, was defeated at
the recent election of officers, mainly on
account of his sympathy with the foreign
arrivals; and Considine was given a strong
tip that if an equally able candidate had
been available he would have lost his job.
“Mainshaft”: The gentleman who wrote
the par. about Darby Itiordan, M.L.A., of
Queensland CB. 13/11 /’24), got Darby and
his brother .Tim mixed. It is Jim, president
of the A.W.TJ., who. won in the Senate plebis-
cite. The statement that he and Theodore
don’t hit it at party meetings is untrue. They
are not at opposite poles. Jim Riordan has
always followed Theodore; and brother
Darby isn’t Red either.
When Canon Shoobridge dropped out at
the 76th milestone,
Hobart lost one of
its most respected
pilots. Like sev-
eral other members
of the clan, he had
been brought up a
Wesleyan, hut be-
came a leading
Anglican, and for
35 years had been
rector of Trinity
parish. His wife
is a daughter of
the late Archdea-
con Davenport.

“Askarri” recalls days in camp :—-
A par. on late Warrant-Officer Vincent reminds me
that his real name was unknown to hundreds who
passed through his hands. He was universally “The
Terrible Turk,” and he made more barrack-room his-
tory than any other dozen men who handled Digger
recruits. His mode of verbal instruction was most
expressive. The best-known was on fixing bayonets.
“When I says ‘fix’ you don’t fix. But when I says
‘bayonets’ you whips ’em out and wops ’em on.” His
injunction to a firing party became historic: “Leanin’
on your harms reversed, half ranks hassumes a mourn-
ful hexpression” There was a tradition that
even when he once had to show in an elderly lady-
caller he kept to the regimental style with “Ole lady
— Shun! Right turn, quick march. ...’Alt!” Some
of the tales were doubtless apocryphal, but “The
Turk” didn’t mind, and they’ve brightened many a
tent group.
A SUN-DIAL MEMORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“An English doctor advan< es the theory in the
Times that an excessively good memory denotes a
morbid state of health. One of the earliest signs
of unfitness is a loss of the art of forgetting
unpleasant things.”
1 see that ancient dial again
That told the time —or struggled to—
Within that plat id old demesne
Where laurels stood and roses grew;
And there were pheasants clipped in yew
And moss-grown grots and leafy bowers.
A timepiece, yes. But soon I knew
It only timed the sunlit hours.
A Latin tag the fact conveyed
To anyone it might concern
In letters cn the base inlaid—
To quote it I would have to spurn
The laws of metre strict and stern—
To read it taxed my boyish powers.
It meant, at last l came to learn,
“I only count the shining hours.”
How oft that dial 1 would explore
Within the garden where I played,
To find the time. But evermore,
It seemed, was less of shine than shade.
Even when summer-time had made
A glory of the ferns rn I flowers,
How oft that mocking face conveyed
It took no heed of sunless hours !
I tread again the old-world sward
Where blackbirds piped and hummed the bee.
The dial refusing to record
The hours of gloom or cloud I see.
The leaden skies are loth to free
The sun, but quick to loose the showers.
I wish I had a memory
That only kept the shining hours.

Most homes have their garden or lawns.
They beautify the surroundings and are the
pride of the household. During the hot
months the preservation of the flowers,
shrubs and lawns is a matter of concern.
Frequent use of the Garden Hose is the only
salvation. The cost of a good hose is not
much—especially when it is of the hard wear-
ing, non-kinking, non-splitting type such as
TITTNT ap
Garden Hose
Millions of feet of this Australian-made Hose
is in use throughout Australasia giving
years of service and satisfaction to users. It’s
being dragged about and subjected to all
kinds of ill-use, but its fine quality and con-
struction gives it the durability to stand up
to years of such use. It is made in three
brands—Dunlop, Oceanic and Federal—and
is without doubt the most economical and
dependable garden hose made. It costs
no more than other hose—the difference is
in the excellent and certain service you get
from it. Ask for Dunlop Hose—its your
guarantee of satisfaction.
Obtainable in various types and all sizes at Leading Stores.

“Bouragi”: Northern crocodiles have evi-
dently been keeping an eye on the Abo. column and
the discussion as to why crocs, leave home. A
Hurald correspondent furnished a vivid report of an
adventure which befell two wayfarers in the N.T.
These were passing a lagoon, when “a fresh-water
crocodile” rushed up the bank, and, “bellowing like
a bull,” went for the travellers. As the corres-
pondent said, this was a most unusual performance
for a crocodile. The beast known in the North as
the freshwater croc, is a fish-eater, confined to inland
lagoons and waters, and is not dangerous to man.
lie is scientifically styled V. johnstonii, after the
old-time inspec tor of black police who first described
him, and is much smaller than his cousin of the
big rivers and estuaries, C. porosus. Spring, when
even a crocodile’s fancy turns to love, was probabl;,
the cause of the croc.’s peculiar behavior, for in
the mating season the beast loses much of his
caution. In this case, too, the belligerent lizard
may have been a married lady with a clutch of eggs
hatching close by. Crocodile matrons have to watch
their eggs against the attacks, not only of birds and
goannas, but of their husbands. Naturally their
tempers are a trifle frayed at these times.
• * * *
“Nitric” : The blowfly pest lias broken out
again so badly in the Queensland sheep country that
the investigations which were stopped through lack
of funds have been resumed. At one time the
Federal Department of Science and Industry carried
out experiments, but then stopped the work on the
plea of “no money”—or no interest. When pressure
was brought to bear the work was continued for
a time —until the close of the season early in 1923.
The State Government recognised the importance of
the work, and asked the aid of the United Graziers
Federation, but these gentlemen considered it was
more a Government problem, and that they were doing
their share by using the methods advocated by the
niowfly Committee. Thus far matters proceeded and
no further. Now W. A. Russell, of Dalby, is carrying-
on the work at his own expense, with the Government
Laboratory at his service. It seems incredible that
such appalling laxity should exist when the most
important industry of the country is imperilled.
* * * *
“Billy Brolga”: It’s surprising how
quickly a bird will pick up a mate on being deprived
of its partner. A female black-backed magpie of ours
that went bush seven or eight years ago, but regu-
larly returns to the neighborhood of her old home
each season as soon as the family is hatched out
and able to fly, lost her mate rather suddenly
this Spring—he got a charge of shot for molesting
the poultry. In a couple of days she was married
again, the new hubby being a youngster who had nor
yet donned his adult plumage. I suspect it was her
own and youngest son, kicked out shortly before the
old man went west. Last year the female of a pair
of black-throated butcher-birds, which for several
years had been hanging around the house, lost her
mate by mishap; but inside of five days she had
another mate —a semi-tame bird which she had roped
in from a neighbor’s about 1 1 mile away. They at
once took up domestic duties, housekeeping having
already been commenced when hubby No. 1 kicked
the bucket. A crow, deprived of its mate, will pick
up another partner in a day or so, too.
* * * *
“Golub”: Although the carpet-snake and
the diamond-snake are classified as
non-venomous, one occasionally
discovers a specimen in which, on
dissection, well-marked poison-
elands are found. As in the ven-
omous species they are modifica-
tions of the salivary glands, and
are placed in practically the same
position as in the poisonous snake.
The only difference is that while
in the latter the secretion is passed
out by means of the fangs and
their ducts, in the non-venomous
kinds it finds its way out other-
wise. It is the presence of these
venom-secreting glands iti non-
poisonous snakes which settles the
argument as to the function of
snake-venom, the purpose of which
is to aid in the digestion of the
enormous meals which the reptiles
commonly devour, and not to assist
in the capture of the snake’s prey,
as was once believed. Practically
every carpet- and diamond-snake
possesses these glands, although
in some specimens they are much
more easily picked out than in
others.
“Caloola” : Tell “Akran” (B. 30/10/’24)
that it’s nothing uncommon to be chased by a snake.
My most: recent encounter happened a few weeks
a S°- I got down off the reaper and binder and went
across the stubbles to tidy up a stook that had been
pulled about by the horses. Just as I got it in
order, a big brown wriggler showed his head and
poked a few inches of tongue at me. There wasn’t
a stick in sight, so I set off for the whip. The
snake commenced to crawl slowly after me. At
first I thought it just coincidence that he should be
going my way. I stood my ground, but when
the crawler, looking very business-like, got within
a few yards of me, I changed my mind and streaked
for the binder. The snake also put on pace, and
in about a hundred yards I gained only about 10
yards. Hurriedly climbing into the seat I started
the horses. The noise of the machine apparently in-
duced the wriggler to change his mind too, for lie
disappeared into the crop.
* * * *
“Herodot”: It would be hard to find a
queerer nesting place than that selected by swallows
that have built in the ironwood of a railway culvert
on tne line near Breeza (N.S.W.). The wheels of
the passing trains are within a few inches of the
three nests there, but the noise and vibration don’t
seem to disturb the families at all. This is the old
people’s second season in the same quarters.
“FY7” shows himself a back-
number when he states that fulminate of mercury
is probably the most unstable explosive known. Ful-
minate as now prepared is very stable. I have been
responsible for the manufacture of over 500,000,000
detonators (10 years’ experience, with a record year
of 82,000,000), and the “gentle pressure” referred to
is no less than 1871 b. per tube in Britain and
America, and 1501 b. in Germany. Tn jambing the
fuse into the tube no trouble will be struck, provided
SAILING DIRECTIO NS.
SKIPPER (noticing erratic wake): “Say, boy! Nobody minds you
writing your girl's name on the flamin' billows so long as
yer don't go back to dot your ‘i’s.”
the operator makes certain that there is no loose
composition on the sides of the tube. The old
Papuan’s accident was probably caused through this
defect, which once was common in German and
American detonators, though not so common in those
of British make. Also, owing to some of the charge
being hung up in the charging plate, the composition
does not get sufficient pressure in this particular
tube, consequently it is loose enough to work free
on handling; then, when the friction of the “loose
particles” is set up, through the fuse or any other
cause, the trouble happens. Also, when very old
detonators get damp, an electrolytic action is set up
between the copper and zinc in the tube and the
fulminate of mercury, forming free mercury. This
free mercury would perhaps cause the necessary
friction, but usually eats holes in the walls of the
tubes. ' I have extracted the composition from hun-
dreds of detonators and tested thousands without
mishap. If the necessary preliminary examination
is performed, this substance is quite as safe and
stable in the manufactured state as most of the
others. The most dangerous detonators to use are
TNT or tetryl, which are most effective when perfect,
but are so liable to undetectable flaw that they ire
best left alone.
* * • *
“Boronia”: Last summer a farm-hand,
while stooking sheaves near Northam (W.A.), felt
something tight around his leg, and, looking down, a
nerve-fraying sight met his eye. About the limb
was coiled a tiger-snake, with its head swaying,
ready to strike. Of course no stick was anywhere
within sight, and to move off the spot meant a sure
bite. Suddenly sighting a fair-sized stone near his
feet, he slowly bent and, picking it up, battered the
reptile’s head against his leg. Needless to say, the
bone sustained some nasty bruises in the process, and
for some days the owner was unable to toil. A
bushman to whom I related this as a brilliant example
of nerve and coolness looked at me in amazement.
“What a blanky fool!” he commented. “Why didn’t
he put his hand in his hat and grab the snake by
the head ?” Come to think of it, this procedure
would have been better. He was wearing a felt hat
at the time, too.
* * * *
“Sylvester”: Re “Nitric’s” doubt of the
transmission of acquired characteristics (B.
16/10/’24). On the Richmond River a farmer had a
bull that used to wander into the neighbor’s paddock
and make illicit love to his cattle. I have seen sev-
eral young calves brought in showing their wandering
sire’s earmark. This earmark -was, I was told, the
rule rather than the exception in his owner’s herd,
but I can’t swear to that. P.S. —I have seen a bitch
with a stumpy tail whelp pups that were entirely
innocent of tail.
* * * *
“Adam Selector”: “Nitric” (B. 16/10/’24)
refuses to believe “Gouger’s” statement that trans-
mission of an earmark often takes place in the cow
country. Nevertheless, it is a fairly common occur-
rence. In the war years I did a little dealing, and
one day swapped some springers for dry stock. In-
cluded in the latter was a red two-year-old heifer with
a piece out of her ear. As the owner had no ear-
mark, I asked whose it was. “That’s the bull’s,”
he replied. I kept her until she had the first calf,
which was normal. I milked her for a time, and
then sold her to a friend. I told him about the
ear, and, like “Nitric,” he looked sceptical. About
a year later I met him and he said: “Remember
the heifer you sold me? Well, she has a calf with an
earmark exactly like her own.” I examined the calf
and found it was so. That was transmission first
from the sire and then through the mother.
“W.H.W.”: Has any Abo. come across a
dingo stalking curlews? Last night I was riding
along, when suddenly I came upon a dingo crouched
and a dozen curlews circling around him, apparently
getting closer with each revolution. My dog smell
warrigal, and all was over, otherwise 1 m sure 1 d
have seen a dingo catch his evening meal.
* * * *
“Hamer”: There are numbers of dogs with
large snake-killing records; still the domestic hound
of Simon Dunne, a
resident of Roci-iy
Lead, in the Ballarat
district, must be ahead
of the mob. A care-
fully-kept tally says
that he has killed 510
since his puppy days.
This easily beats the
record of a 11 arren
(N.S.W.) fox-terrier
which was claimed to
have killed over 400
before a death-adder
hung to his lip and
injected sufficient
poison to cause a fune-
ral. Professional snake-
catcher Fox had a dog
which used to hell:
him hunt snakes, and
no doubt would have
had a big tally if its
sense of duty had not
prompted it to capture
rather destroy;
and a dog belonging to
“German Charlie,” the
Bunnerong-road (Rand-
wick, Sydney) hermit
of a couple of dotades
ago, iiit'-i a reputation
for having been bitten
scores of times and
being unaffected by
snake-poison. He killed
snakes nearly every day; for Bunnerong-road land
had >n those days more snakes to an acre than there
are cottages in the district now.
“Chum”: Yes, there are some expert
weight “guessers” about. At one of Maoriland’s big
shows the beast in the guessing peri was a six-year-
old rough bullock; 1 put in 88Slb. and he weighed
88811 b. Someone got his exait weight, so 1 was
among the also-rans —beaten by a whisker.
* * * *
“Six and Eight’’: How came sheep to be
called jumbueks? A paleozoic resident on the Xamoi
asserts that it is a corruption of the aboriginal word
“jombock,” which means a white, fleecy mist, and
that because the newly-shorn fleece associates itself in
the mind with such a mist, the word came into use
in its present sense. The derivation seems somewhat
fanciful, so it will bo interesting to know what the
George Washingtons of the Council have to say about
the matter.
* * * *
“8.5. A.”: Westralia is the State with
■the greatest number of emus and kangaroos. In
some places the latter are so numerous that they are
a nuisance to farmers, whose crops they trample
down. A motorist on the Wongan Hills (W.A.) had
an opportunity of giving a number of tests to our
native speeders. For a short distance, he found, an
old-man kangaroo could do about 35 miles per hour:
but he soon gets blown. Hunters know that an old-
man seldom goes more than a quarter of a mile before
he looks for a tree to back against while he fight-
the dogs to a finish. Does can keep up a smarter

pace for a greater distance, and are able to do 40
miles an hour. Near Williams (W.A.) I noticed
that seldom the dogs were able to run down a doe
—the bucks were usually the victims. Emus can
gallop, too, and can keep in front of a car showing
40 m.p.h.

SONG OF THE WEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh to be out in the West again,
The West again,
Where the hard, lean bushmen go;
To shed the collar and vest again,
To wangle the miles and rest again,
Ili-ho for the Westlands, oh 1
Camel or pack, and a golden haze
From suns unclouded to light our days,
And cloudless skies in a lonely light
To arch the calm of a Western night!
Oh to be out with the best again,
The best again,
Out of Pilbarra or out of Broome,
Easy going and plenty of room,
A reef to seek or a deed to do,
A black quartpot and a nigger too-
Ah, to be out in the West again!
Oh to be gone to a Land of Gold
So young in story and yet so old,
To take a chance though the flour-bags shrink,
And soupy water is hard to drink.
Hey and a-ho for the bars of Perth,
For days of pleasure and nights of mirth,
Hey and a-ho!
The gold dust won and the wine aflow—
A-hey and a-ho! A-hey and a-ho.
You’ve heard the story of Jack Dalveen ?
His credit was closed, he hadn’t a bean ;
His old man said, as these old men do,
“You can go to Hell, 1 have done with you!”
He worked his passage, he’s proud to say,
On a cargo tub to Cossack Bay;
He shed the East and he started square—
Now Jack Dalveen is a millionaire.
Hey and a-ho.
There’s old George Falls, of Oberon ;
We sat together in days long gone,
Clapping our heels in the mornings cool
Under the desks at Oberon school.
A FASCIST UPHEAVAL.
FELIOW-DINER : “This damned Mussolini's stirring things
up a hit.”
DAD: “Go on! I thought it tasted a hit crook myself.”
I hear that George has a fortune made,
Over in Broome in the pearling trade—
Good-o ! Good-o !
And he’s bought a farm by Busselton—
You like to know how your pals get on,
Hey and a-ho.
Camel or pack and the wide Nor’-West,
Oh to be out again on the quest,
The quest again !
Out of Carnarvon or out of Broome,
Camel or pack and plenty of room,
Oh to be out in the West again!
Oh to be out in the West again,
To take a chance with the best again;
To wangle the miles and rest again.
A-hey and a-ho!
To make a fortune or face a fall,
Camel or pack and God for us all,
A-hey and a-ho!

[opfi Bec.rd Watson's)
“Pick”: The usefulness of the crow has
again been upheld by a retiring S.A. stock inspector.
With “Adelaide’s” par. making the glad announce-
ment came to me a report from a Monaro (N.S.W.)
sheepbreeder, to the effect that this lambing season
the depredations of the crow have been worse than
ever. Formerly, at their worst, they pecked out the
eyes of weaklings and tore out the tongues of lambs
unprotected by their mothers; this year the added
charge is laid against the foul fiends that blood-
poisoning and almost certain death has followed in
hundreds of cases where they have attacked lambing
ewes. It will take a lot more scrubbing to make the
crow white in the eyes of N.S.W, sheepmen.
“Bouragi”: The eagles “Larrapinta” saw
hunting in company in the Macdonuell Ranges (B.
6/11/’24) were following a common custom of birds
of prey. The habit has long been noted in the
golden eagle of Scotland, one bird quartering low
over the hillside to start the mountain hares, and the
other waiting aloft to pounce. Nearly all the
hawks hunt in this fashion in the breeding season,
when the youngsters are insistent for food and plenty
of it; some of them arc quick to utilise the help of
man in flushing game for them, as many a duck-
shooter can witness. In a good season in the west
of Queensland the little grey goshawk, and often the
carrion kite, can be seen ranging in front of a mob
of sheep or cattle moving through the grass. They
are after grasshoppers and other small game rising
in front of the mob.
“S.M.H.”: A Clarence town (N.S.W.)
dairy farmer had a Jersey milker whose eyesight was
so defective it caused a falling-off in her milk
supply, and she had to be hand fed. He hit upon the
happy idea of spectacles, which enabled the lady to
roam the pastures again, and her milk supply came
back to normal. P.S. —I have just returned from a
trip farther out. I told a man about our cow. He
said that last week he had surprised an old-man
’roo who sported a monocle. They are awful liars,
those chaps farther out.
THE PLAGIARIST.
CHARLIE: “ You shouldn’t laugh at your own jokes.”
BERTIE: “He’s not.”
“L’N.”: A Vic. civil-service clerk while
on holidays dropped in to see a. friend who has a
week-end shanty on the Gembrook narrow-gauge line
beyond Ferntree Gully. Hearing a knock on the
back verandah he turned around, expecting to see
another human caller. “Oh, that’s Jackie for his
supper,” said the host. The shack-owner hurried
over to a wire safe, and, taking out a bit of raw
steak, cut it up into squares and put it outside.
Jackie was a kookaburra, and he had a mate with
him. He was accustomed to knock for grub on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings. He seemed
to know when the boss was ordinarily “at home.”
“Papalang”: “Bouragi” (B. 16/10/’24)
is quite right; the missionary’s boots were not eaten,
and I can provide some additional evidence. At the
time of the tragedy I was cotton-planting on Taviuni
Island. The unfortunate victim (Rev. Baker) in-
duced a part}’ of young native teachers to accom-
pany him on his ill-fated expedition; two only
escaped the slaughter by bolting at the outset of
the attack. From the density of the wild sugar-cane
these men witnessed during the night the roasting
and eating of their companions. We planters used
to recruit our cotton-
pickers from these
cannibal mountain
tribes, and I can dis-
tinctly remember an
occasion when one of
them called out (in his
o w n vernacular),
“Won’t someone tell us
a tale while we’re
working? Let Gio tell
us about how they
killed and ate the
white missionary.” Gio,
a bullet-headed, repul-
sive-looking young sav-
age, promptly obliged,
and after going into
the minutest details of
the butchery, ended up
by assuring his audi-
ence that Misi Baker’s
flesh was “like that of
a pig.” “But,” he
added, “we could not
eat the boots. We
boiled them for three
days, and the women
scraped them with
their sharp stone
knives, but they re-
mained so tough we
could not eat them.”
About a year after-
wards the writer
dropped across the
two native teachers
who escaped, and they
continued the first part
of the story. Subse-
quently H.M.S. Chal-
lenger called at the
islands, and the writer
was one of a deputa-
tion that waited upon
the Commodore to ask
-iin to send an expedition to avenge the Rev.
Baker’s death. The reply was: “If your people will
go beyond the bounds of civilisation that’s your own
affair. I can do nothing for you.”
* * * #
“Nulla” : “Bill R.” avers that ewes recog-
nise their offspring by hearing, while others say Ma
Jumbuck’s scenting apparatus does the trick. Both
theories are right. The long-distance communicating
is done by sound, but final recognition depends on
smell. With goats it is the same: especially notice-
able is Nannie's complete failure to know her off-
spring by color —I’ve seen a goat with the only
black kid among a number of white ones doing the
rounds of the group till she scented out her own.
Is Mrs. Billy color blind altogether, or is her sight-
memory only at fault?
* ‘ * * *
“Yakopi”: Kite-fishing is practised along
the north coast of New
Guinea —at Seleo and
Aitape, for instance—
but does it extend any
farther eastward into
the Pacific? Or is it
to be correlated with
the other indications of
a comparatively recent
extension of Malay .or
Indonesian influences
along the north coast of
New Guinea, and pos-
sibly even farther east
into Melanesia? Both
from the sporting and
the utilitarian point of
view the idea of using
a kite to tow a hook
and bait, and then pad-
dling out and gathering
the fish when it is
hooked, is one that
would appeal strongly to
any Melanesian fisher-
man who had ever seen
it used. But it would
not be much good in
Rabaul Harbor, for in-
stance ; usually there is
not enough breeze. The
only trouble at Port
Moresby, on the other
hand, is that there
might be too much all the south-east season.
“W 03”: One of my tame grey wallaroos
died, leaving a joey four months old in the pouch.
The nipper was reared on goats’ milk and thrived
until she was eight months old; then symptoms of
blindness developed suddenly. The pupils of the eyes
became much dilated, and changed from deep blue-
black to pale bluey-grey. In two days she was com-
pletely blind. It has been suggested that the foster
mother’s diet is responsible for the trouble. Can
any abo. diagnose, or suggest a cure?
“Machete”: Touching “J.G.’s” remarks on
the wild cat’s habit of eating its prey “out of its
skin” (B. 6/11/’24), I beg to present Chutney, a lady
cat who has owned me and my family for some years.
She is an accomplished ratter, and regularly produces
one in a semi-dazed condition from parts unknown,
for there are none in the house. When she has got
tired of seeing the womenfolk climb chaits, Chutney
eats her game. When she is finished there is left
the complete skin, opened down the front, with head
and tail attached. Only the paunch is rejected of
A CASH TRANSACTION.
CONDUCTOR: “ Your wife on the inside, sir, hasn’t keen paid for.”
FARMER HAYSEED: “ That’s enough cheek from you, young feller —
you and your time-payment missuses!”
the rest. I have watched her a dozen times; like
“J.G.’s” wild cats, she opens thei chest first. After
that she seems to do most of the abstraction with
her tongue, and a very neat job she makes of it.
“Centurion”: “Borom’s” remarks on the
fondness of the North Queensland Chinese for octo-
pus (B. 6/11/’’24) leads me to wonder why our
large Dago population seems to religiously abstain
from what is one of its staple foods in its own part
of the world. In Greece and Southern Italy, octopus,
raw and cooked, is sold in the shops and markets,
and I have seen it in the windows of Greek eating-
houses in Alexandria and Port Said, to which
it is probably imported, for the rocky
bottoms in which the evil-looking beast delights are
not to be found along the Egyptian littoral. Here,
in Australia, though the faces of the fish-shop pirates
are the same, one misses the less sinister countenance
of the octopus.
* * * *
“Doc. B.”: If collie dogs are treacherous,
who will tell me about kelpies ? I had a pure red kelpie
that attacked me viciously and unprovoked on four
occasions, badly lacerating my arms twice. I have
heard of other red kelpies putting up similar per-
formances. A strange thing is that a half-kelpie, half
collie-dog, for years in my possession, was the kindest
and gentlest thing in canines that I have ever met.
“Stephen B.”: “Bonney” (B. 23/10/’24),
referring to the speed of emus, says he could not get
more than 32 to 35 miles per hour out of them. All
I have to say is that his Harley was not well tuned
up, or the Lake Bonney emus were overfat. One of
my emus (there were three of them when the chase
started) hit up a mile at a 40-mile gait, and my
speedometer, on a 1924 light-six Studebaker, is abso-
lutely correct —I have tested it with a watch over
various distances. If “Bonney” is not satisfied with
this he can bring one of his emus to Murrayville, and
I’ll race him for a tenner if I can tfind the same
bird.
*** * *
“8.V.E.”: Re the remark of “Baro” (B.
23/10/’24), “very few men cooks and none of the
other sex can make bread equal to a baker’s.” Where
has “Baro” spent his life? Let him get out back
amongst the Queensland and N.S.W. sheds, where
“first-class bread” is the main item of a cook’s
repertoire. Let him get amofigst some of the won-
derful women of Outback and sample bread that is
bread. Let him go to some of the country shows and
see samples baked by cockies’ wives. Under great
difficulties these women turn out bread fit for an>
epicure. A remark was passed by a judge at the
Northam Show (W.A.) on bread baked by the women
of Irishtown: “The most wonderful bread I have
ever seen. It’s a pity our professional city bakers
can’t give us something like it.”
* * * *
“Gouger”: The most interesting and really
brainy method of capturing their tucker I have ever
seen aboriginals employ is in euchring the smaller
species of hawkbill turtle, away up at the top end of
Cape York Peninsula. The bucks first catch uninjured
a tough-looking specimen of the sucking-fish, from
a wave-washed coral pool. The mouth of this fish,
so far as my unscientific mind Will understand it, is
an apparatus like the business end of a suction
dredge. Whatever it sucks it holds. The fish is
carefully covered in the bottom of the canoe with
wet seaweed; then a long, strong line is tied
securely to its tail. A calm, warm day is chosen —
a day on which turtles love to come to the surface
and indulge in forty winks and a sun bath. The
big shellfish spotted, the sucking-fish is slipped into
the water. He swims lazily about for a while—
to recover his wind, as it were. Soon he swims slowly
in the direction of the turtle, and if the big shell-
fish dives, he dives too. Both are at once lost to
sight, but the deft paddlers shoot the canoe in the
froth of the now whizzing line. Comes a jerk, fol-
lowed by a mad rush. The turtle is fast. The
connecting line is handled gently, while the steers-
man follows the frantically swimming turtle, which
is quickly exhausted, as it pulls practically the
weight of the canoe. What the sucking-fish feels
like I wouldn’t care to know. One turtle caught this
way turned my scales at 60lb. The sucking-fish
adhered to it so tenaciously that when held up
by the tail it clung to the ’spended weight for 10
minutes.
* * * *
“Spike”: On top of the Western Tiers
(Tas.) there is a shrub locally known as the
Mother Jumper. It grows up to 3ft. high and
has pear-shaped leaves of vivid green; as the shrub
grows, the lower leaves and branches wither, but
cling to the stem. When a match is applied to the
leaves, they catch immediately, and bursting into
flame with a crack, emit a thick, dark smoke which
smells like an oildrum on fire. In winter time
the drovers use it for their billy fires; neither
snow nor water affects its inflammable qualities.
Does it grow on the mainland, too? And what is
its correct name?
* * * *
“Morob” : Of all the weapons used by the
natives of New Guinea, a spear made on the Warriar
River is probably the most fiendish. The head, about
nine or ten inches long, is attached to the shaft by
being fitted into a socket. The prongs are placed
both ways, forwards and backwards; and the head,
when it enters the flesh of some victim, comes out of
the shaft. It is then impossible to move it back-
wards or forwards, and the only way it can be got
out is by cutting it free, an operation which lew
white men could survive. In the' old days, when
the Germans ruled over that territory, a native who
was caught with one of these weapons was given a
flogging and a spell in gaol.
* * * *
“Eva Brick”: I had occasion to go into
the back yard at sunrise the other morning, and
noticed our pet magpie carolling on the clothes-prop.
I thought I would offer a few words of appreciation,
so took my stand beneath the prop, looking up at the
bird and making the few observations usually con-
sidered the correct thing under such circumstances.
Whether it was the undue familiarity w : ith which T
addressed her, or the vision of an unhealthy past she saw
reflected in the rather thick lenses of the glasses I was
wearing, will never be known. Like a flash of light-
ning she dived at the left lens, her beak striking it
fairly in the middle, cracking the glass in all direc-
tions ; then it slid off to the corner, where it almost
severed the gold rim. My eye is still intact, but the
bird died quietly and suddenly soon after.
ANOTHER TOTE OF NO-CONFIDENCE.
SWAGGY : “I 'card your ole man forkin’ poli-
tics down at the pub last night; an’
right in the middle [?] it Hinnissy’s cow
just poked her ’cad in AN' THEN WALKED
AWAY!”
“Billy See”: Old Bill was telling about
a visit to the store to buy a new axe-handle. “Says
I, walkin’ into the store, ‘And how much is yer axe-
handles to-day, Mr. Burke?’ ‘Two-and-six,’ says
he. ‘There’s a box of thim at the door, so take
yer pick.’ I paid him the half-dollar and picked a
handle; and, damme, when I got home if I didn’t
find that it’d got a head on it!”
A SOU’-WESTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The white-sailed boats from Half-Moon Bay
Have reached the fishing-grounds outside,
And now, w’ith main-sheets slacked away,
Drift slowly on the ebbing tide.
Bold fishermen in jerseys blue,
Long rubber boots and oilskin-coats
Are hauling cod. I see the new’
Cold gleam of silver in the boats.
But clouds roll up o’er Foveaux Straits
Of leaden front and ragged form ;
The gulls fly screeching to their mates,
A forecast of the coming storm.
The sun is blotted out of sight
Behind a mass of sullen grey,
White scud is flying high and light,
And crested waves are blown in spray.
The fishing-boats show’ sharp and clear
Like petrels driven by the gale;
The women w’atch in doubt and fear
Each flying speck of close-reefed sail.
’Midst booming surf and thunder’s roar,
With lightning flashing through the gloom,
The fishers safely reach the shore,
And head for Deacon’s billiard-room.

Melbourne Music Club members met in the
Victorian Artists’ Galleries the other night
to feast on the musical fare supplied by
violinist Muriel Campbell, pianistically
assisted by Harold Smith, with songs by Elsa
Warman. Muriel, who is one of our finest
exponents, delighted the experts with a soul-
ful rendering of something by Cesar I ranck
which had its first outing in Melbourne that
night. Fritz Hart thanked the performers
amid corroborative cheers. Amongst the list-
eners were the Bernard Hall pair, the Albert
Miller widow, the Thorold Harpers, Arthur
Hordern, Mrs. Fritz Hart and all the Albert-
street high lights.
Thanks to the John Ilindson widow, who
handed over her big two-decker house at
Canterbury for the purpose, St. Martin’s
Boys’ Home has now got a big brother, to
be known as the St. John’s Institute. The
gift, which is to keep green the memory of a
dead husband and an elder son, was accom-
panied by a cheque to cover the high cost of
renovations. Padre Eric Thornton, who is
commander-in-chief of the Home, is not
asking, but is hoping, that some other good
Samaritans may materialise as a shower of
gold to pay for the extra staircase and other
expensive sundries demanded by the Health
authorities. Boys over ten drafted from St.
Martin’s to the senior home chortled glee-
fully at their inviting-looking new quarters
with their de-luxe bathroom, whose hot tubs
and showers will make it easy to practise
the cleanliness that is next to godliness. Miss
L. Henty has supplied the whole of the
chapel furnishings, and the seven suburban
women’s committees have stocked the cup-
boards and linen shelves.
Mayor Rigby, who is to take a second
year’s wear out of the Hawthorn civic bunny-
skins, with his Mayoress was at home one
day last week in the local Town Hall for
the double purpose of celebrating his return
to office and welcoming ex-State Treasurer
William McPherson and his wife back from
their globe-trotting. The interior of the hall
was festooned, and blushed witli rosy lights
and draperies. Mrs. Rigby diffused a wel-
coming smile in filmy black and crystal glit-
ter, and Mrs. McPherson stood up in billowy
silk and lace. A travelogue by the star
guest headed the menu, which included musi-
cal dishes served by Mrs. Zelman, Alexander
Wright and Louise Jorgenson.
The Western District’s purest merinoes
emptied themselves into the rectangular
metropolis the other day to see Vera Arm-
strong and the William Moffatts’ youngest son,
Don, married at the Malvern kirk. Uncle
Laidlaw came from Hamilton to lead Vera
to the sacrifice. The mediaeval bridal satin
was girdled with gold, and more gold glinted
among the blossoms anchoring the bridal
tulle and beribboned the lilies sheaved on her
arm. Two Moffatt sisters, Fairie and June,
’maided in a mist of blue georgette wfith red
roses perched on their shoulders and trick-
ling over their dark blue hat brims. Keith
Morrison best-manned, with Keith Calvert
in reserve. The bride’s widowed mother un-
leashed the customary jollo in No. 9 Darling-
street.
Mrs. Papua finds Brown Brother not
wholly satisfactory as a gent.-help. Soup con-
cocted with toilet soap, curries made with
knife-powder and eau-de-Cologne used to
clean the saucepan interiors don’t help to
keep the housewife’s temperature normal.
But perhaps a Moresby bride struck the
limit the other day. Returning from a visit
she dropped into a chair and noticed her
brown imp polishing the linoleum on the
verandah floor. Said she as she sipped the
cool lime-squash: “You’ve got a fine shine
on the floor to-day.” The lad wiped the floor
reflectively and spoke: “It would be much
more like the glass you look at yourself in,
but the grease is all finished.” Mrs. Papua
snorted: “The wax all finished again! What
have you done with it?” The boy smiled
and wriggled his slim body. “Sinbada [mis-
tress], it was such a small tin: the only one
I could find on the table before the big
glass.” Mrs. Papua rushed to her room to find
her last tin of face-cream gone. The boy is
still running.
Muriel Petlier, of Perth, is one of an
octette of sisters who are all gifted instru-
mentalists. Michael, the ’cello-playing
Cherniavsky, was so impressed by her talent
that he iusisted on giving her lessons, and
prophesies that she will go far. The other
day she came to Melbourne with sister Lilian,
violinist with William Heughan, and is now
taking hints from Hattenbach. Dad, who
earns his crust as Government photographer,
is a tine violinist who makes fiddles: his
third effort is now being used by another
violin-playing daughter, and is remarkable tor
its richness of tone. Music has run m the blood
for generations. The ’cello used by daughter
Muriel, which is nearly 200 years old, is
inscribed with the name of its original owner,
William Pother, and each descendant who
has inherited the instrument has had also the
skill to play it. The mother of the melodious
eight is also musical, and their home over-
looking Perth water is as full of harmony
on Sunday nights as a church belfry. Some-
times the orchestra betakes itself to a
Canadian canoe and drifts around the fore-
shore, to the delight of South Perth sub-
urbanites.
There was unwonted excitement at a ses-
sion of the Presbyterian Assembly the other
day when it was reported to the meeting that
two £2O-notes had been picked up at the en-
trance of the Assembly Hall. One of the
cloth raised a laugh by remarking regretfully
that “they must belong to some member of
the laity.” But he was wrong. The money
was claimed later on by a clergyman. Per-
haps the fact that it was Cup-time made a
difference.
Be you maid, wife or mother, the Woman’s
Mirror is going to add to your joy in life.
The Mirror is The Bulletin’s consort, and
she discourses wisely and gaily of many
things: of jazz, of course; of sport and
health and fashions; of the baby, how to
care for him and how to amuse him; and
being like all Australian women, clever with
her hands, she gives you a needlework design
and a free paper pattern each week. As a
further charm the Mirror wears a serial by
Ethel Turner, and short stories and verse by
Australian writers. It has struck Melbourne
as an amazing three-penn’orth.
English Priminister Baldwin has followed
Labor’s lead and given a woman a Ministerial
job. She is the Duchess of Atholl, LL.D.,
and her appointment as Parliamentary Sec-
retary for Education opens a new page in the
history of the English Conservative party. The
Duchess sits for Kinross and Western Perth
(formerly her husband’s seat) and is one of
the most brilliant figures in Scotland. An
Australian w 7 ho lately heard her in Edin-
burgh says she impressed him far more than
the loudly-boomed Lady Astor did. The Duke,
by the way, holds a mere 19 titles, and was
Lord Chamberlain in 1921.
The wide-awake eyebrows here depicted
by Buskin belong to organist William Box,
one of this State’s most promising young
musicians. The congregation at St. Paul’s,
out Canterbury
way, habitually
lingers after
evening ser-
vice to hear
hi s outpour-
ings of Bacli
and Debussy.
On December
3 William is
staging a con-
cert in aid of
fresh millinery
for St. Paul’s
male choris
ters in the
new Camber-
well Memorial
Hall, with
Evelyn Ash-
ley and. the
silver - tenored
Kirby as the
particular
stars. Before Box reached his 17th mile-
stone he showed his mettle with several
successful recitals on the fine organ
in Clement St. Danes, which used to be the
parish church of the A.I.F. in the Strand;
and the English musical world lifted aston-
ished hands when the youth was asked to
take charge of the Christ Church (Hamp-
stead) organ, in succession to such experts
as Dr. Walford Davies and Sir John Stainer.
The annual meeting of the Friendly Union
of Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers was held
in the Government House drawing-room with
Lady Forster in the chair. The Union,
which helped the soldiers’ womenfolk to bear
their war years of suspense and loss, has
wandered somewhat out of its sphere by en-
rolling members who, having married their
men after they had left their soldiering days
behind them, are only in a manner of speak-
ing soldiers’ wives. The membership, having
thus swelled to over a thousand, threatens to
crowd out the Masonic Hall, and the com-
mittee is temporarily frowning on fresh
applicants.
Birdman George Mackiualty claimed Mrs.
W. Moore’s lamb Eileen on Thursday even-
ing at South Yarra Christ Church. The
veteran Byron Moore handed his grand-
niece over, and vicar Townshend adjusted
the bonds. Eileen’s sacrificial white was
shimmered over with crystal, orange flowers
held captive the bridal tulle, and water-lilies
and lilies-of-the-valley were posied in her
hand. Alice Clapin and Ailsa Roberts
’maided in creamy lace curtaining pink
sheathings, with shoes of palest green; two
flying “loots,” Luckie and Fryer-Smith,
seconded the ’groom, while a flock of bird-
men upheld an arch of proven steel for the
newly-weds to pass under. Mrs. Moore, in
a black jetted frock which shone like newly-
broken coal, uncorked the good wishes at No.
9 Darling-street.
The Commonwealth Bank staff assembled
in its dining-room one afternoon last, week
to cheer manager ,T. S. Scott to the deputy-
governor's chair in Sydney. Colonel Hilmer
Smith and Mr. Lewis were spokesmen. The
good wishes were freighted with a gold watch
for the banker and a wristlet-watch for his
wife, who smiled her appreciation from under
a cinnamon hat-brim.
Weather permitting, there will be a garden
fete in the grounds of Glamorgan, Toorak,
on December 6 to add a brick or
two to the finances of the Colling-
wood Cr&che-cwm-Kindergarten. Now that
the Labor Ministry has gone, and with
it the threat to take over the free kinder-
gartens, the committees have taken fresh
heart. Mrs. V. L. Solomon, who will furnish
the toilet stall at the fete, will be helped by
a forty-pound cheque from a bridge-playing
she staged in Mrs. Edgar Dye’s Queen’s-road
parlors. Green baize-covered tables were
dotted over the ballroom parquet and flowed
over to the music- and dining-rooms. The
gathering was a friendly affair, and the pro-
ceeds were even more than were looked for.
The Rotary Club admitted the ladies to
its councils at the Melbourne Town Hall last
week, with the pleasantest results. The in-
vitation given the guests to air their views
of the club in 16 words was a fun-producer.
Mrs. R. C. Lewis carried off the honors for:
“I like Rotary, because for one hour every
week members become boys and remember
other boys.” The suggestion was made that
women should occasionally be admitted to
the weekly luncheons of the club.
Professor Ernest Scott, after 11 years’
hard toil, has been granted 12 months’ fur-
lough, and is leaving for Europe. Mrs.
Scott (Emily Dyason), who is one of this
city’s leading pianists, is going with him.
Ernest broke his first matrimonial chains
years ago, because the lady who bore his
name —she is the daughter of Annie Besant
—-refused to live in Australia. The Uni-
versity Historical Society, of which he is
president, fed him at the Oriental recently
and wished him bon voyage.
The Donald Mackinnon pair, witji daugh-
ter Marie, will land back from their Ameri-
can year on the 29th inst. Their friends are
all thirsty to know how our ex-Trade Com-
missioner and his wife really liked Uncle
Sam and his family, and how they prospered
at Washington, where Precedence rages.
Rumor has it that daughter Marie intends
to make rather more than a hobby of en-
couraging intimacy between Amurrica and
Australia. The Frank Clarkes, who have
been keeping the moths out of the Mackin-
nons’ South Yarra home for the past 12
months, are now switching over to a Fail-lie
House flat.
Mrs. Murray Black, lately back from
America, hurried down from Gippsland last
Week to cheer nieces Kath McMicking and
Gladys Wertheim on their way to matri-
mony with a tea-and-ehatter party in the
Alexandra Club parlors. Kath is steaming
to England and the John McLellands’ son
Roy by the Maloja; and Gladys will be
made over into Mrs. Bill Failing at the Mel-
bourne Grammar Chapel on December 15.
Mrs. Black hostessed in foulard of magpie
colorings, with a blue lining to her flower-
trimmed hat.
Jim Armytage, who died at his Geelong
home, Turkeith, last week, was a son of
late squatter Felix, and belonged to one of
the most widely connected families in the
Western District. His paternal grandmother
was a Fairbairn, one of his aunts married
a Hopkins, while two other relatives were
linked with the many-branclied Staughton
tribe. Jim, with his wife and only son,
Reggie, left his Winchelsea acreage a few
years ago to settle in Geelong.
The Robert Landale widow came home
from an English trip the other day with the
return half of a steamer ticket, which will
take her back for a fresh matrimonial ven-
ture. The ’groom-designate, brother-in-law
Walter Landale, who lives in London, is also
revisiting his native Aussie, and will follow
the lady home by a later steamer. The lady
hails from the Riverina, where her late
father, Dr. Noyes, had his brass-plate in
Deniliquin. Another Noyes sister married
another Landale.
Westralia lost one of her pioneers when Mrs.
Harriet Stirling lately passed over. She was
born at Perth in 1849, and married Frederick
Robert Stirling, who helped to blaze the track
on Groperland’s Inky Way. Her father was
a well-known Hay-street (Perth) draper, and
her mother was governess to the family of
Sir JameS Stirling, W.A.’s first Excellency.
Geelong considers it has a star advertise-
ment for its climate in Mr. and Mrs. Morris
Jacobs. The old chap is 98 and the lady
two years younger; and the other day flags
flapped and telegrams fluttered in celebration
of the 70tli anniversary of their wedding.
Mr. Jacobs still attends to business, although
lie is beginning: to think that in a couple of
years it will be about a fair thing to retire.
A young Australian who left his native
country in his early boyhood and started
making a name for himself across the seas
is Hamilton Bateman, who comes back to
Melbourne as a violinist with a reputation.
He was born in Collins-strect only 19 years
ago, but his youth does not prevent his
fame as a violinist being comparatively old
—he was only 12 when a Queen’s Hall (Lon-
don) audience first approved of him. A
show that Bateman is giving at the Mel-
bourne Town Hall next week is only inciden-
tal to his visit.
Nearly all Australians are song-makers,
but the subject of this picture is a successful
one. His name is Murray Gibbes, and his
“Red Rosebud” has bloomed pretty well all
over the Em -
pire, and has
had great
popularity in
M e 1 b ourne’s
suburbs.
Nearly 100,000
copies' of it
have been sold,
so that with
the help of
those who have
picked it up
and played,
sung or
whistled it “by
ear,” several
millions must
have heard it.
Mr. Gib b e s
has written be-
tween 20 and
30 songs, and
Paling’s, in
Sydney, have
lately issued a book of six little things of just
the right length and sentiment for encore
numbers. But since a man lives not by
songs alone, Mr. Gibbes’s real job i# life is
teaching voice-production in Sydney—he is
an exponent of the Bouhy method of becom-
ing a Castles or a Cecil Sherwood.
Nellie Melba had the Club rooms on Fri-
day for a farewell gathering of the best
known. Lady Forster, with Miss Carleton
and Lady Helena Rous, looked in. It was
a friendly show.
The Countess Stradbrokc has blue-pen-
cilled her social engagement list indefinitely
to be with her youngest child, Christopher,
who is still seriously ill.
Leah Myers, who sang so entrancingly in
the Rigo opera productions here, has fol-
lowed up her vein across the seas. Some
weeks back she got a sudden call to sing the
title-role in Debussy’s “Melisande” with the
British National Opera Co. in Birmingham,
and was acclaimed as a star of the first
magnitude.
Former Melbourne conductor Buesst, who
lately has been guiding the British National
Opera Co.’s orchestra, has been appointed
professor of score-reading at the Leeds
Royal College of Music, a post which will
not compel him to lay down his baton.
Adelaide’s gleanings:—
Will Ashton, just back from London, where three
of his pictures helped the show of the Royal Institute
of Oil Painters, brings cheery news of Australian
artists overseas. Power, George Coates and his wife
(“that charming and handsome couple, immensely
popular here,” W. J. Sowden writes), Cumbrae
Stewart, Quin and Burgess were others whose pic-
tures were on the Royal Oil Painters’ w r alls, and
Power found himself amongst the biggest askers
with the £2OO he wanted for his “Digger.” The
Coateses, by the way, have established themselves in
Chelsea, where they can throw stones, if they w r ant
to, at Carlyle’s house.
Adelaide singers on the other side are in good
voice, too. Ivy Phillips caught the ear of Brighton
at a concert there, and Henry Wood says that Helene
Taylor, who is going to sing the Mad Scene from
“Lucia” for him, has a voice that, in more senses
than one, will fill the Albert Hall.
The Conservatorium’s fifteenth and last concert for
this season produced a rare fledgling in Hilda
Barnes, whose clear, flexible soprano should take her
a long way.
At the Red Cross Society’s quarterly meeting at
Government House the other day Lancelot Stirling,
in the chair, suggested the enrolling of Boy Scouts
and Girl Guides as a junior branch of the beneficent
tree. Josiah Symon’s lady, Mrs. Harold Davies and
Miss Meithke are to sit down and think out the best
way of doing it.
Wanda Edwards’s pigmiest pupils staged a fantasy
at the Norwood Town Hall last week. Birds and
butterflies, flowers and fairies, dawn, sun and the
morning breeze, fluttered like thistledown about a
charming garden, and then changed hastily into
Russian folk-dancers and classical Greeks. Miss
Edwards was her own mistress of the robes, design-
ing the dresses as well as planning the ballet.
Miss M. Kitson, our first woman lawyer, lias
retired from practice. Before she could be admitted
as a Notary Public, a special Act had to be passed.
Although she has never done court work, she has
had a large office connection, which she now relin-
qu idles in favor of a life-partnership with J.
Tenison-Woods, a rising young barrister.
Adelaide will greatly miss Mrs. Harry Bickford, a
Lady Bountiful who has died at North Adelaide in her
78rd year. During the war she was a great con-
tributor to patriotic funds. She presented an aero-
plane and two motor-ambulances, and did many
liberal and patriotic acts which got no publicity.
She even had a special representative in England to
see that the Diggers did not go short of comforts.

STOCKINGS
E. J. and Dan Carroll flung the doors of
their new theatre wide open on Friday even-
ing. and tried “The Ten Commandments,”
with full organ effects, on an invitation audi-
ence. The beautiful theatre shows Moorish
influence in its architecture. The main
entrance leads into a promenade so seduc-
tively lit that the complexion worry is en-
tirely eliminated, and, acting on the inspira-
tion that it’s a long lounge that has no rest-
ing place for two, the architect has planned
a temptingly upholstered and tapestried
alcove on each side of the marble stairs.
There’s a fountain, too, and graceful model-
ling by sculptor Eva Benson to soothe the
eye of the cavalier who has to wait. The
theatre' is built on the Elizabeth-street level,
and flights of shallow marble steps between
walls of Dutch tiles lead up from the Castle-
reagh-street level. Its decoration and uphol-
stery are in tones of old gold and gobelin
blue, and, above the proscenium, lights as
changeful as a sunset diffuse their rose, gold,
primrose and Nile green through a fretted
flower design. As for the crystal centre
lights and wall lamps, they brought to mind
Teddy Cahill’s story of the Indian rajah’s
palace where the small pianist got a crick
in his neck from his hypnotised stare at the
candelabra. The big orchestral organ, the
first of its kind in Australia, gives you both
the feeling of being in church and the exhilar-
ation of having a night out. In addition,
there’s a live orchestra that pops up and
down with the charm of a Jack-in-the-box
on its elevator platform. The theatre was
packed on the opening night with civic dig-
nitaries and social deadheads. Town-clerk
Layton made an impressive entry, and is
rumored to be arranging for a special screen-
ing for aldermen only of the Ten Command-
ments. E. J. Tait and manager Westmacott
were among the early comers. Mrs. Carroll,
E.J.’s mother, sat with her son and his
handsome wife in one of the front boxes, and
Edna Thomas and accompanist Mary Hyams
added glittering cloaks and old-time hair-
combs to the gathering.
Death being non-sectarian and as universal
as life, all kinds of everybody turned up to
the supper-dance in aid of the Hospice for
the Dying. The Wentworth floor couldn’t
have held another couple. There came
Queensland Premier Theodore’s lady, in a
frock of the heavenly blue that dreams in
Chinese glazes; Victor Mann, of the Art Gal-
lery, brought his daughter; and Madeleine
MacCrae shepherded father Hugh; young
man from Chicago Campbell Ryan, who has
been at everybody’s party this last fortnight,
got further into our stride ; composer Murray
Gibbes sang two of his own works; and the
medical Eakins were present—he’s the tall
doctor whose good looks make pain a pleasure
to Darlinghurst flappers. Sister Kervin, of
St. Margaret’s, brought a party; and Mrs.
Heaton and Ruby Adams were other dancers.
Pretty Mrs. Slattery and Mrs. John Magney
shared the secretarial burden ; the Leahy and
Ward matrons looked after the treasury, and
Mrs. W. Macleod was president of the week’s
success.
Early this week the National Council of
Women swung the billy at the Sign of the
.me Gum, in Pitt-street, and farewelled pre-
sident Mrs. MacCallum, who with her pro-
lessor leaves for England in December. Shar-
ing the toasts was Miss Brown, who, unde-
terred by all she has learned in tw T o years’
secretaryship to the Council, is rushing to-
wards, matrimony, that bourne from which
there i s no return —only, sometimes, a shunt-
ing. Well, she does it with her eyes open.
For the day-nursery matinee there were
such stars on the bill as Nellie Stewart, Sey-
mour Hicks, Ell aline Terriss and Claude
t aiming; yet, following their natural bent,
some of the daily papers had no eyes for
anything but a set of tableaux by society
lasses. The tableaux were as heady as a
dish of weak Pekoe; the strong drink was
the Balcony scene, with Nellie Stewart, a
gallant Romeo, tossing the rose of romance
to embowered daughter Nancye, and irre-
sistible Floie Allen in company with Claude
mining. \\ hat with the swings and the
'oundabouts the afternoon’s takings smile
cheerfully at the four-figure mark.
At last Australia House has justified the
money this continent borrowed for it —it has
saved High Commissioner Joe Cook a bill at
■laridge’s or the Cecil for daughter Winnie’s
wedding. Winnie, who was married to Cap-
tain Robert Cook early in the week, cut
the wedding cake in the marble halls ot Aus-
tralia House, where father and mother en
tertained herds of visitors at what the re-
ports describe as “a brilliant function. ihe
knot was tied at St. Clement Danes, right
next door, and Winnie made her entry on
dad’s arm. her ivory satin frock wearing the
newest thing in mediaeval lace sleeves. Two
bridesmaids, in blush pink moire and seed-
pearl Juliet caps, two train-bearers and two
pages were in the entourage.
Pretty dark-haired Constance Pliillipson,
of Elizabeth Bay and one-time of Perth,
swept up St. James’s a whisper of tulle and
satin the other night to sign the life-partner-
ship contract with Douglas Gordon Car-
ruthers, second son of the knighted Car-
ruthers couple. Sybil Scharrer and Alice
Carruthers, looking efficient in a froth of
bronze georgettes and lace, followed her
train, squired by Joe and Wallace Car-
rutliers. Bride’s mother provided nourish-
ment at the Ambassadors for the host who
came to offer congratulations.
St. Philip’s staged the second military alli-
ance of the week when Nora Westcott, of
Wollstonecraft, married Major K. M.
Thompson, of the Staff Corps, Victoria Bar-
racks. Canon Bellingham blessed the vows:
The time-immemorial white satin and tulle
encrusted the bride, and sister Dorothy and
Beta Thompson, with best-man Captain
Philip Westcott and groomsman Major
Berryman, were the supporting cast of the
evergreen one-acter that onlookers never
grow tired of. Military dignitaries were
thick along the front pews and at the wed-
ding party at the Mary Elizabeth, wher*
bride’s mother and father did the honors.
White lilies decked St. James’s for the
wedding of pretty Marjorie Maud Cox-Taylor
and Dr. Cosmo Fowler, M.C. The bride
walked up the aisle hanging on big Dad’s
arm—lie’s Colonel Cox-Taylor, D. 5.0., a
gunner in the old R.A.A. She wore her long-
veil sweeping over her fair hair, with a coro-
net of orange blossoms round her forehead ;
and the white satin gown that floated under
the veil came to an end in a long frothy tail
of georgette and pale pink tulle. Bridesmaid
Heather Cramsie, in silver and blue tissue,
had her betlirothed, Noel Cox-Taylor, at her
side; and Major Berryman and slender
bridesmaid Sybil Dowse, in satin brocade
like the heart of a pink rose, stepped out in
the wake of the bridal pair. Afterwards the
bridal party and a large following of friends
made an unprecedented invasion of the offi-
cers’ mess at Victoria Barracks. A great
rose-tinted canopy shaded the bi'ide’s blushes
as she struggled to carve the cake with a
very ancient Royal Ai*tillery sword—older
even than the historic cedar mess-table at
which Marjoi-ie and her new husband sat.
Mrs. Cox-Taylor was at one end of this
table, in black silk with a big velvet hat.
A true Daughter of the Regiment she; born
in the old military quarters. Dawes Battery,
where her father, the late Colonel Spalding,
put his feet under the table used for the
bridal party of his grand-daughter, she has
the unique experience of having spent all
her life in barrack quartei’S. General and
Mrs. Brand, Brig.-General and Mrs. Lloyd,
Colonel and Mrs. Sturdee and all the officers
of the Staff Corps w T ere amongst those who
sang “For They Are Jolly Good Fellows” in
several keys.
Queensland Premier Theodore’s lady has
been in Sydney for a w 7 eek or two, but." after
her long absence in Europe, she was keen to
get back to her hospitals and her wounded
soldiei’s in Brisbane. There are those who
say that it w-as at her suggestion that the
Golden Casket was revived for the benefit of
the hospitals in the Northern State —and
almost every one of them has a maternity
w r ard ! Now Mrs. Theodore says she intends
to think out a
scheme to pro
vide the limb
less soldier
with security
for the future.
While in Eng
land the attrac-
tive - looking
couple we r e
hidden to a
family lit n-
cheon at Wind-
sor, to which
not only the
Prince of
Wales came,
hut Princess
Mary's baby
also put in an
appearance
at dessert.
The Queen
was very in-
terested in
Australia, where, she remarked, she had seen
the kangaroo in the wild. But here George
Rex intervened with a royal chuckle: “Oh
no, Mary, you didn’t see them in the bush. I
saw them there —you saw them in the Zoo.”
The Queen didn’t reply, but there was that
look in her eyes which every woman knows,
and which means: “Well, dear, you can say
what you like, but I know.”
Still another bride of last week was Phyllis
Helen Gurney, second chick of the Major
Gurney couple of Hobart. The bridegroom
was Guy Francis Wright, of Allambee, Cam-
den ; and the wedding took place at St. John’s
Church in that village of old dreams.
In Sydney there’s an organisation called
the Smitli Family. Its object is to do good
by stealth, and when it relieves distress the
recipient of its kindness only knows that
the Smith Family lias been to the rescue.
Well, the Smiths had a wedding in the
family the other night; and they decided to
make it an occasion for collecting presents
—not wedding presents for the newlyweds,
but Christmas gifts for the poor. To this end
over 1000 invitations were sent out, and it
was hoped that each would represent at least
a half-guinea. The scene of the wedding
was the Palais Royal, and there on the wide
dancing floor Hilda Stuart breathed the
usual vows and was duly riveted for life
to Matthew Emile Toussard by Padre
McVittie. The jazz band supplied the Wed-
ding March, and four bridesmaids and two
trainbearers followed the pretty bride to the
bower or arum-lilies and orange-blossoms
where she and her ’groom received congratu-
lations. If you weren’t actually at the
wedding, don’t be shy about sending your
gift to the Highland Society’s rooms, where
a shilling gets just as warm a welcome as a
guinea.
This lady with the perfect profile is Mrs.
R. S. Suttor, of Yaucluse, 01.3 of Sydney’s
cleverest amateur actresses. She has taken
part in many
Repertory
uroduc tions
and is a pillar
of the Shaks-
peare Society.
Her remark
able speaking
voice is clear
and sweet, with
sudden con-
tralto depths
here and
there that
was one of the
reasons why
Robert Brough
chose her
while she was
still a flapper
o play ingenue
roles. In those
days she was
pretty Hope
Mayne,' and
her father was one of J. C. Williamson’s
managers. On Thursday next (Dec. 4) Mrs.
Suttor will produce J. M. Barrie’s “Rosa-
lind” at the Conservatorium in aid of the
Kambala School Purchase Fund.
Audrey Pickburn is helping the illumina-
tions of Darlinghurst with a brand-new
sparkler that John Faviell, of Collinrubee
station, Narrandera, has placed on the finger
that points the road to matrimony. Audrey’s
father was the Judge who died too soon.
Mother then first became a Judge’s Associ-
ate ; now she runs Springfield, the up-to-date
boarding-house that has sprung up on the foun-
dations of the decorous old-time Springfield
which irreverent flappers used to call the
Rest Cure.
Lindfield may be said to be almost lit with
diamonds. Still another of its daughters is
getting used to that engagement-ring feeling.
She is Annie Sheedy, and the man in her case
is Percy Macdermott, of Glenroy, Wyong.
The Engineers at the Uni. gave a ball the
other night to help pay for their bell in the
Carillon. This is to cost £660. and £6OO
ot it is already in hand. A bunch of pretty
Kiris had seen to all the arrangements, and
Rupert Markham and John Shaw had been
energetic secretaries, so there was a great
roll-up in the new Union hall.
n w 1^ 10 ? ]akp is another entrant for the
GalJi-Gurci stakes. A coloratura of umpteen-
carat power, trained under veteran Do
Giorgio, she gave her first recital last week
at the King’s Hall, and pleased the ear of a
big audience, with the fluency of her voice
and the brilliance and confidence with which
she tackled a programme that included opera-
tic anas such as the Mad Scene from “Lucia ”
and old Italian and modern works. Iris
de Cairos Rego and A. .T. Morris were the
supporting artists, and teacher De Giorgio
proved the perfect accompanist.
The Woman’s Mirror is the belle of Aus-
tralian women’s papers. Its first number
which arrived on Tuesday, has fascinating
articles on dancing (by ,T. C. Bendrodt), oil
golt (by an ex-woman champion), on cook-
ing. fashions, books. There’s a corner for
the. piccaninnies, and a typical Ethel Turner
serial. Jack Abbott lias dropped in with
on Vl hls b , c ; st yarns ’ anfl there is an article
on baby welfare of interest to every mother
in Australia. With eacli number there goes
a Perfectly splendid free paper-pattern. In

elastic, William Moore will write about art
and women artists, and there’s to a really
practical talk on how to embroider your
own window curtains. And not the least
attractive feature of all is that the (54
pages cost only threepence.
The Cavalier Club turned out to a deb.
to welcome Ernest Watt and daughter Pamela
the other night. Pamela is a pretty, slim
blonde, a sort of Princess Snowdrop out of
a fairy story. This first impression was
heightened by a white-and-gold evening-cloak.
Ernest was very smiling and brown and
glad-to-be-backish, and everybody made a
speech. Ruby Adams, wearing her hair in
a new style, looked like a modern Madonna:
and, for the rest, the three long tables-fuli
were much the same as usual. When the
jazz started, the Club, as one young woman
remarked, seemed to be a gathering of all
one’s uncles dancing with all one’s nieces.
It wasn’t a bit too hot for dancing at the
Palais on Friday night. That was one of
the reasons for the great roll-up of jazzers.
Another was the committee of pretty girls
that the Sydney Hospital Auxiliary had
lured to help with the Spring Ball. From
this will arise on December 25 a Christmas-
tree whose fruitage of dolls and hooks and
meccanos will cheer the sick kiddies in the
Macquarie-street institution. Mrs. A. B.
Sliand was president of the Santa Claus
money-spinnei’, and the committee included
such exponents of perpetual motion as
Bronzie Clonan, Dorothy and Marjorie Lea,
Valerio Britten and the Carruthers sisters.
Mrs. Mark Foy was the outstanding dresser
of the night in a Geraldine Farrarish black
velvet creation warmed up by a flame-colored
feather fan. Matron Kellett stepped out in
jetty embroideries ; and the medical Fiaschi
couple were among the rhythm-weaving
crowds on the floor.
On the 26th the Vagabonds stage “Just
Like Judy” at their old haunt, St. James’.
The play will run for four nights; and on
the 29th the comedy will help to fill the
petrol-tank of the Rose Hall motor-car.
(Rose Hall is for disabled Diggers.) The
Vags. send £lOO a year to meet this bill.
The Roseville Musical Society is every
day and in every way growing stronger and
more musical. During last week it put on
“Paul Jones,” its best production to date.
Philippa Alston, a clever girl with a good
voice, took the name-part, and was a great
success. Artist Percy Benison (Don Tro-
cadero) snatched a leaf out of Leslie Hol-
land’s laurel wreath; and another to catch
the eye and ear was Aileen Bear (Yvonne).
Sister Brisbane adds a P.S.:—
“The O’Brien Girl’’ is at home at His Majesty's,
and her receptions have been crowded. His Ex.
took a party to the first night. He was also at the
shivoo given in the Elite to aid the Seam:ns
Institute Fund when Thelma Robinson’s pupils danced
merrily and Mrs. Symes staged a one-act play in
a gorgeous peacock gown. The vice-regal party in-
cluded Pamela Nathan and Captain Turner.
Some forty answered the call of Mrs. Gilbert
Wilson to a Mah Jongg and bridge afternoon at
Montpelier. Carnations and shasta daisies embowered
the drawing-room and lounge, and the dining-room
was all mauve and yellow blossomry. The guests
included the Michael Rogers, Bruce, Ross-Munro,
Cecil O’Beirne, Cecil Palmer and H. C. Mills dames,
and Mollie Brenan.
Deputy-Mayoress Wilson summoned 50 to tea and
music at Lennon’s on the same day. The eastern
lounge was filled with gladioli and carnations, and
red gerberas were on the tea-tables. Mrs. Wilson’s
Oriental silk was topped with a black-and-white hat.
For Margaret Robertson, who is soon to marry
Dr. Weaver, Joan Macdonald tea-ed a party at her
Clayfield home ; and Leila Baynes filled the c ups at
Lennon’s in the same good cause. Her guests included
Margaret and Joan Robertson, Mabel Weaver, Hilda
Walsh, the Bruchos and Evelyn Horstmann.
Barbara Sisley and Rhoda Felgate arranged a
pageant for the Y.W’.C.A. in the Elite, for which
Iris Brown played the leading part in “Everygirl."
Sir Matthew went to Enid Tardent’s piano recital
at the Elite. Great things are predicted of the
14-year-old prodigy; Ted Theodore and Mrs. Barnes
are helping things along.
Mrs. George Nathan gave a party at Government
House to Mesdames J. T. Bell, Bruche, Whittingham.
Shand, Michael Rogers, Ross-Munro, A. D. Walsh,
Jean White-Haney, Grant, Roskruge and Cumbrae
Stewart, Miss Highfield and Elfrida. Walsh.
Ethel Osborne’s concert in the Exhibition Hall was
so crowded that all some people got was the portion
that floated through the windows.
Joan Lillev said “I will” to Stuart McLean in
St.. John’s Cathedral one evening last week, Canon
Dixon coming up from Southport to tie the knot for
his old pupil. George Sampson played the accompani-
ment and Dr. Charles Lilley gave his sister away.
Ivory-brocaded satin and a lace veil with a bouquet
of pink carnations and white lilies were the bride’s
array; Eleanor Hart ’maided in rose pink; and
lan McLean best-manned.
On the same day, at St. James’s, Toowoomba,
Norman Coote kept his date with Beryl Dines amid
white lilies and satin ribbons. Canon Davies did
the deed, and Lawrence w-as at the organ.
Mrs. W. T. Robinson and Mrs. Oannan tea-ed
wvirgaret Robertson in Lennon’s, with pink carnations,
roses and lilies as a background. There was a
big roll-up of the bride-elect’s friends.
The 21st saw an army of smiling buccaneers hold-
ing up the traffic on behalf of the Mater Public Hospi-
tal, which deserving charity will substantially benefit
bv their exactions.

DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
Whatever happens to Gilligan and his men
in the Test matches, they have already established
the impression that they are good sports. When the
Victorians were struggling to get 142 runs in 116
minutes the Englishmen changed ends briskly and
discarded “theory” bowling, and their chivalrous
tactics were a factor in Victoria’s fine six-wickets
success, which was gained off the third ball of the
over that was to have been the last, and
in which Mayne (87), Woodfull (61), Hart-
kopf (56 n. 0.) and Hendry (36 n. 0.) figured
creditably. Coming to Sydney, the invaders
were heartily greeted by big crowds (34,000 watched
them on Saturday), and the consensus of opinion
in the members’ pavilion, where the veterans con-
gregate. was that they would take no end of beating
in the Tests. Collins won the toss, as usual (he also
had his customary life), and N. S. Wales batted on
a wicket that was never difficult on the first day,
although interruptions were caused by rain. Bai'ds-
)ey retained his position in the Australian XI by
contributing a chanceless 142 n. 0., made in his finest
style, and Taylor also came to light with an elegant
51, while the cantain obliged with 32. But the others
were never at home to Tate (6 for 68), who got
Macartney and Kippax caught in the slips and
Andrews 1.b.w., all for blobs. He is undisputably
a class bowler.
On Saturday the N.S.W. innings closed for 271,
Bardsley retiring at 160, c. and b. Tyldesley (3 for
74). and Tate finishing with 7 for 74. Ilobbs and
Sutcliffe —a keen, confident fellow who will get.
plenty of runs in Australia —opened for the English
men, and with Scott and Gregory rocking ’em in for
all they were worth the crowd saw some thrilling
cricket.' Hobbs (8) went first, magnificently caught
in the slips by Gregory, and Sutcliffe (17) hit
Gregory into Kippax’s hands at. mid-on. Then
Kilner snicked Scott into the slips and the A.I.F.
giant took another grand catch, 32 —37. The
wicket was a bit troublesome, some of the fast
balls rising head-high, but it wasn’t really bad.
Sandham (21) and Hendren made a useful stand,
but it was 8 for 121 when Tyldesley joined Hendren,
Gregory having grabbed two more catches. The
Lancashire professional proved a surprise-packet,
helping Hendren to put on 59 runs, of which his
own share was a plucky and vigorous 36, made in
44 minutes. The last wicket fell at 193, Hendren
having weighed in with a patient and, in the circum-
stances, invaluable 75 n.o. The N. S. Wales field-
ing was superior to that of the Englishmen ; Gregory
was wonderful, and Andrews as brilliant as ever.
Mailey (4 for 55), Scott (2 for 37), Gregory (2 for
46) and Macartney (1 for 33) collected the wickets.
Going in when five wickets had fallen for 74,
Andrews averted a N. S. Wales collapse in the second
innings. He lost Collins (another 32) at 106, but,
batting beautifully, was largely responsible for the
total reaching 221. Of 147 scored while he was at
the wickets, the little man made 86 n. 0., an achieve-
ment which will probably earn him a place in
the XT instead of Kippax. Tate took 3 wickets for
59 ; Tyldesley 6 for 83. Exactly 300 runs were
needed, and the Englishmen had 160 of them on the
board with six wickets in hand when the Bulletin
printer urged that he had an appointment with a
lady, to wit, the Woman’s Mirror.
“M.H.”: In my judgment, Maurice Tate’s 7 for 74
was the finest bowling effort seen on the S.C.G. for
many years. A tall, bulky young man, with a grin
that won’t come off and enormous feet, Tate bowls
right-hand and makes remarkable pace from the pitch.
After (lie 1922 season Wisden described him as “by
general consent, the best bowler in England,’’ and 1
won’t quarrel with the description from what I have
seen. For Sussex, Tate took 45 wickets in 1919, 27
in 1920, 61 in 1921. 122 in 1923, and 219 in 1924.
He is a son of slow-bowler F. W. Tate —Pa played
for England v. Darling’s XI at Manchester in July,
1902 —and is rising 30.
“Hamer”: There is a quaint connection between
the skipper of the English team and the earliest
days of big cricket in Australia. The only survivor
of the first inter-State match between Victoria and
N.S.W. is believed to be David Sargeant, who settled
in Melbourne in 1852. He took strike for Vic. in the
opening match and sent the first ball for two. Later,
he returned to England and was the medico who
presided at the birth of the present English captain.
Ninety-three years of age, he still has such an
interest in the game that he was amongst those who
farewelled the team on its departure from England.
“Past Grammar”: Kilner, the stocky Yorkshire
lefthander, is strongly reminiscent of his great country-
man Bobby Peel, though he puts more effort into
his deliveries than the incomparable Robert. The
latter’s mutton-chop whiskers are not in evidence
in Kilner’s case, but the figure and the short waddling
run are there.
“Wink”: Hartkopf’s match-winning innings against
the Englishmen did not astonish the people who
watch him regularly in pennant cricket, for Saturday
after Saturday lie is that sort of batsman. Their
surprise has been that he did not always adopt this
natural hard-hitting policy in big games instead of
pottering about and poking at the half-pitchers,
full-tosses and long-hops, because they came from
bowlers with big reputations. The ground bowlers
of the Melbourne club, who help him at practice, and
other excellent judges warn him continually that on
the defensive he is easy money, but as an aggressive
batsman lie is most difficult to shift. Now the
success of his last hit should prove to him that his
well-wishers arc right and that he is better as a
Banner than as a Bannerman,
“Hambledon”: I
note that the vocabulary
of the cricket reporter
has been enlarged ;o
tlie extent of one or
two quite new expres-
sions. The mot juste
for smart and 'well-
judged r unning between
the wickets at which
Hobbs and others excel,
is “judgmatic,” _ a
word which my dic-
tionary refers to rather
disparagingly as collo-
quial but which seems
to meet some previ-
ously felt want in
cricket chronicling.
More puzzling is the
adjective “hostile,”
with or without inten-
sives, as applied to
certain bowlers or
forms of bowling.
Surely all bowling is
inimical. No, perhacs
not quite all; I once
saw “W.G.” pitch up
a full toss to leg so
that a colt who had
made 99 in a county
match, and was becom-
ing painfully nervous,
could get his century,
and I suspect that the
first two balls Mailey
bowled to Clem Hill
in the recent Howell
benefit match were
meant to be hit. Also,
it is obvious that a
bowler whose captain
desired the other side
to avert a follow-on
m i g h t eliminate
hostility from his de-
liveries. But these are
unimportant exceptions
to the rule that in a
normal game, as some
poet has phrased it,
“Though the man with
the bat is a fellow, the
man with the ball is a
foe.” Some better word
than hostile might be
employed to denote
that ens trundler is
showing more bite than
another.
The Croweaters’ batting in the second
match against Victoria on the Melbourne C. G. was
much brighter than that of the home team. Play,
owing to rain, did not start until 3.47 on Friday,
but before stumps the visitors, with a dull outfield
to militate against rapid scoring, put 163 on the board
for four wickets, Arthur Richardson’s contribution
being a masterly 81, made in 125 minutes. Pritchard
helped “Specs” to add 115 for the fourth wicket, and
cn the second day Pritchard carried his own score to
115—-his first century in big cricket. A waggle in
the tail, provided by wicket-keeper Ambler, who won
a bet by making 21 not out, lifted the S.A. total to
288. There was an attendance of 20,000 on Saturday,
but the crowd was as much interested in progress
reports of the game in Sydney as in the inter-State
match. Before stumps, Victoria had lost two wickets
for 156. With a wonderful throw from the boundary
the 19-year-old Wall disposed of Mayne, who was
sauntering along at his leisure when the ball broke
his wicket. Between the showers on Monday, Ponsford
(120 n. 0.) and Love (54) lifted the score to 280, with
four wickets down; but the remaining six wickets
were disposed of for an additional 77, Ponsford’s
stumps being skittled by Grimmett when he had
made 166. If there was any doubt about his inclusion
in the XT, this innings should settle it.
* * * *
“Centurion”: The Australian selectors
have approved of seven players for the match, an
Australian XI v. England, at Brisbane, on Dec. 4.
They are Collins, Kippax (N.S.W.) ; Ponsford, Wallace
(Vic.); A. Richardson, Grimmett (S.A.) ; and
Taafe (W.A.). Queensland will supply the other
four, and these are almost certain to be Ilornibrook,
Oxenham, Thomson and O’Connor (stumper). It is
a sound, well-balanced side, with a great variety in
bowling and batting.
* -X- * *
“Hamer” : There is a Melbourne cricketer
who is embarrassed at every appearance by a fair
follower’s full-throated enthusiasm. He is by no
means a dashing bat, but even a restraint which his
own sex finds deadly is a virtue in the eyes of his
idolatress. “Isn’t lie just beautifully patient!” she
gurgled when the young man was stonewalling. “He
just stays there quietly, letting the ball hit the
bat, and never getting wild as some of the others
do! Wouldn’t he make an ideal husband!” Now,
every time the unfortunate youth goes in he is liable
to be greeted with the anxious inquiry, “Eh, Tom!
Are you married yet?” And ribald laughter shows
that the story has spread.
* * * *
The manner in which Spar go went down
before the hardfighting Hebrew, Joe Fox, at the
Melbourne Stadium, suggested that the loser ought
to give the game best. Joseph is a fighter of much
suddenness, and Spargo’s defence crumbled before his
onslaught like the forts of Belgium before the swift
Hun attacks; and. if Joe had only sailed in after
delivering a terrific right in the third round, the
affair might have ended there and then, for Spargo
was groggy. But consideration for a management
which rarely has an emergency contest ready, or for
a public which expects 60 minutes of stousli for its
money, perhaps weighed with the vulpine pug. ; and
the fight went on for the full distressing 20 rounds—•
distressing because not once in the encounter did
Spargo look like having a chance. There was a
comparatively poor attendance. As in Sydney, peon’s
have grown tired of paying famine prices zo see the
same old stagers box week after week.

But for Ivalms and Willard. N. S. Wales
would have fared badly in the inter-State tennis
tournaments at Melbourne. In a great fight with
THE UNTHINKABLE.
CRICKETER: “Would ’ee like to ’ave a few ’its, Gap’en?”
MANAGER: “I’d like to, bony, but I doan’t think 'ed be zackly the
thing.”
CRICKETER: “’Ore’s that, Gap’en?”
MANAGER: “Why, ’e’d never do for the manager to be bowled
out.”
Pitchett and Mclnnes, the Cornstalks won the third
set 16 —14, and then they covered themselves with
glory by beating Patterson and O’Hara Wood 6 —l,
C—4, after taking the champions to 12 —14 in the
first set. Willard was dogged all through, and
Kalms used a wristy forehand drive very effectively.
In the singles, however, the latter was overcome
by O’Hara Wood, and Schlesinger accounted for
Willard and Patterson for Peach. Victoria’s second
team defeated the South Australians; and in the
skirt department Victoria vanquished S.A. and Tas-
mania, but failed, after a tremendous tussle, in
which smelling-salts were used vigorously by the
onlookers, to add the N. S. Wales girls to their
list of victims.
**■*■*
The down-the-line racing provided by the
Epsom (Vic.) R. C. resulted much in favor of the
gent, behind the bag. Punters started auspiciously
when Ashtaroth (7 to 2) got home in the Two-Year-
Old Handicap; but the rest was mostly disastrous,
a 25-to-l chance in River Amos winning the Steeple
(there were 19 starters, for a wonder), and another
25-to-l shot, David Garrick, arriving in the Trial
Plate. But King Pan (7 to 2) was not so bad
for them in the Epsom Handicap, although eithei
Textile or Irish Rhythm would have been better.
Irish Rhythm was one of the horses sold out of the
Tye-Corteen-Godby stable, and looks as if he eoule
do with a spell. A lot of the money that changed
hands was lost on Dempsey’s mounts —five, and not
a winner among them.
* * * *
“Rust”: The day after the 1923 Melbourne
CJup four of us were stooking in a paddock neai
Savernake (N.S.W.). Papers hadn’t arrived, and wt
were waiting for the result. Away along the dusty
road about a mile from where we were working a
small cloud of deeper brown indicated a vehicle com-
ing along. We tossed as to who should go, and bill
lost. He started off at a smart walk, which increased
to a sprint over the last 300 yards, as the vehicle
seemed likely to pass him by. Out of breath, he
stopped a large, dreamy man in an ancient gig with
a “Hev, what won the Melbourne Cup?” Into the
stranger’s eyes came a look of wonderment. “The
Melbourne Cup!” he said. “Where’s it run?” Bill’s
disgust was too deep for civility. “Savernake,” he
roared. “Savernake, you crimson fool.”
**” * *
“Chiron”: The pony courses have their
cheap-priced Davids and Eur.vthmies, too. Deen, who
recently won at Richmond (Vie.) with lOst. 131 b..
and in heavy going at that, was bought for 50 bob at
Dandenong, and has since earned approximately
£lOOO in stakes. A much better average than that of
the Westralian champion, good as Eurythmic’s was.
* * * *
The A.J.C-. meeting at Randwick on Satur-
day was another bookmakers’ benefit; and there
have been a lot of them lately. Fierabras (6's),
Kainga (7’s), High Chief (B’s), Valiard (s’s),
Mussop (10’s) and Villerov (12’s) were the winners,
and each was a profit-earner for McShortodds, albeit
that gentleman protested bitterly that, owing to mam
good punters having gone to the cricket match,
“the game” was “no good.” Prince Charles let
the public down again in the Members’ Handicap.
Mussop, tiie winner, is an aged recruit front ttic
“ponies,” and at his best the Prince could easily
give him the 271 b. he was called upon to concede,
but Toohey couldn’t induce the erratic beast to do
his best. Valiard had an unusually easy time in
the Three-Year-Old Handicap; the judge gave it
to him h.v six lengths, and the electric clock made
it lmin. 25$sec. for seven furlongs. The colt is a
half-brother, by Valais, to Poitrel.
* * * -Sfr
The £lOOO and gold bauble that went to
the winner of the Albury Centenary Cup drew such
good gallopers from Melbourne as Feathornest, Heir
Apparent, Llanthony, Jackstaff and Warwickshire.
None of them however was equal to conceding his
handicap to Centreline (20’s), a Eudorus —Equator
gelding that ran a fair race over 12 furlongs :it
Flemington on Cup Day. He finished comfortably
two lengths ahead of Llanthony (9 to 2) . and llei;
Apparent (3’s). D. E. Castles, who owns and trains
Centreline, is his seventh proprietor.
* * * *
Though Oxford Uni. went down hard to
the All Blacks, who scored 33 points, they put up
the highest total ever recorded against a Maoriland
team in England—ls points. The Oxford side in-
cluded Raymond, the N.S.W. three-quarter, who
played full-back; Wallace, of N.S.W. and Scotland;
Wesche, also of N.S.W. ; and Aitken, the M.L. and
Scottish centre. Aitken captained the Maoriland
side against the Springboks when they were over this
way. The ’Varsity’s showing was much better than
in 1905, when the All Blacks won 47—0.
“Past Grammar”: England and Maoriland will
meet at Twickenham next Wednesday. It will be the
third match in the old country, and at present
honors are easy; the Native team of 1888-89 went
down by 7—o, and the first All Blacks won by
15—0. The interest in the cnmi"s>- game can he
judged from the fact that the applications for reserved
seats bv Rugby clubs alone have far exceeded the
40,000 people which the Union’s ground can hold.
The general public will have to stay away and be
content with the broadcasting of the barracking.
* * * *
“Te Pana”: Nepia, the Maori with the
All Blacks, has been astonishing the Eoglanders by
his barefooted place-kicking. In M.L. a decade ago
the Maoris never used boots on the field, considering
that they hindered pace. W. Warbrick, full-back in
(lie first.’Native team, was a fine exponent of bare-
footed place-kicking, and so was Wiremu Uru. Nepia
kicks equally well with or without a boot.
* * * *
“Past Grammar” : An iconoclast appeared
in the last British amateur golf championship in
the person of H. D. Gillies, who insisted on using
a special tee, nine inches in height, instead of the
usual handful of sand. There was nothing in the
rules against the use of the artificial tee, but it
took the governing committee ail the first, round to
recover its breath. Even then it didn’t slay Gillies
and bury him in a bunker. Instead it “regretted"
that players, “instead of trying to master the use
of golf clubs, should endeavor to overcome the
difficulties of tho green by using abnormal imple-
ments which have never been associated with the
game.” This broadside of words was effectual; the
offender hauled down his flag, or, rather, his tee.
* * * *
“Nitric”: “Bobsir’s” quote for a bad run
of cards in auction bridge (B. 6/11/’24) is not really
exceptional. In a “pivot” game lately I was the
mug in not scoring a point; the other three players
each scored over 1000 points. But my biggest
.Tenth was in a recent game of poker in a school of
four. A friend was dealt four aces cold, but bought
another card, as any player would do in such a case.

first appearance this week, will devote a section to
hints and instructions by experts in various games

IN THE GARDEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Kelleway refuses to play for his State this
season unless the N.S.W. Cricket Association is
prepared to allow him something more than three
months’ salary for absence from business. Amongst
other incidentals he pointed out that he would
have to employ a gardener. A patriotic citizen
immediately rushed into print with an offer to tend
Kclleway’s garden two days a week during the
big cricket season.”
Come into the garden, Kell.
Aow the ball ’n’ bat time’s flown.
For a full day’s graft at old Adam’s craft
I’ve put in on my own
While you were sending the batsmen back
And making the bowlers groan.
All day have the larkspurs heard
The willow-on-leather batoon,
All day have the pink carnations stirred
To the barrackers’ jubilant croon.
I mean they were with you in spirit, old bird,
The whole of the afternoon.
I said to the rose: “The hard day goes,
I’ll lay that your boss is set.
is lie picking Cilligan off liis toes
Those fours to the fence to get?
Or warily tapping Tyldesley’s slows?”
1 asked of the violet.
The languid lilies would quiver and thrill,
The tulips shook by the gate
As we strained for the roar from the clo e-
packcd hill
To tell that your bat was straight.
And a whisper came from the daffodil
“He’s knocking the length off Tate.”
I know not how* could the flowers discern,
But 1 guessed from the pansies’ throbs
That when with the ball you were given a turn
You’d skittled the stumps of Hobbs,
And riglit-abouted the careful Hearne,
And Sutcliffe, too, for blobs.
Come into the garden, Kell.
Where I’ve plied the mower and spade
O’er lav'n and glen with the strength of ten,
By patriot impulse swayed,
While you were showing the Englishmen
How cricket should be played.

THE INKY WAY.
Costing the price of a pint of beer, the Christmas
number of Aussie is drawing a good few eightpences
from Bung’s cash register just now. But the cheer-
ful monthly with its Yuletide embellishments is
worthy even of alcoholic sacrifice. The national
humor is well represented in 82 pages of gay Verse,
stories and drawings.
“O.P.H.”: Apropos of the death of J. F. Hogan.
Once at least he returned to Melbourne, and some
of us cherish a pleasant recollection of the recep-
tion given to him at the Cathedral pub in Coll in s-
street and the delightful raillery of D. H. Mating
(“Ithuriel”), who was on the Argus with him. Hogan
played up to Maling’s banter, and made us like him.
Peace to his ashes!
“Keystring”: Passed out recently, after 50 years
on the Inky Way, spent mostly on the Northern
Rivers (N.S.W.),'ll. B. Waterhouse, of the Rich-
mond River Express (Casino). “Ben’s” sheets
were always cleanly conducted; and his own strong
convictions never prevented him from letting the
other fellow hav,e ; his say. Oddfellowship and bowls
were his diversions.
“Laodah”: Those papers which print pictures of
Australian homes might do a great service to the
countrv and, incidentally, to art; but 1 doubt if they
do all they might. In a Sydney North Shore suburb
I know a Georgian house which flaunts an Italian
pergola composed of Doric columns with Ionic
capitals surmounted by the crosspiece of a Japanese
torii or temple gateway. This composite master-
piece figured in a recent issue of one of them, with
a eulogium upon its style.
Veteran Jimmie Madgwick, who passed out the
other day, followed the Inky Way all over N.S.W.
His first venture was the Grafton Observer ; followed
the Advocate, which he launched at Maclean; next
be brought the blessings of a free press to Cooma ;
and after that Mungundi woke up one morning to
see itself in print. Dozens of other country news-
papers at one time or another brightened at his touch,
but failing health induced him to seek Nirvana in
the Government Printing Office, Sydney, where he
held a job for the last 20 years.
“Avoncliff”: An adjective encountered with dreadful
frequency in the dailies, especially since the Sydney
City Council leapt into fiercer odium than usual, is
“aldermanic.” The dictionaries admit its existence
in a half-hearted sort of way; I don’t quite know
why. It ought to be “aldermanly” or “alderman-
like.” The conduct expected of a gentleman js
“gentlemanly” and of a sportsman “sportsmanlike” ;
why, when another species of man is concerned,
is an adjective coined on the analogv of “German
or “talisman” ? Is it because “aldermanic” is
never used except invidiously ? —certainly, one never
hears of a city dad being held up to admiration lor
fine aldermanly behavior. Anyhow, if the noun has
only sinister associations for the public, “alderman-
nish” would be grammatically preferable to “alder-
manic.”
“Schnorrer”: Jews, as a rule, are no more sen-
sitive than Scotchmen to jokes about their alleged
racial characteristics, but they warmly resent asper-
sions which are not intended to be merely humor-
ous. Hence, in England, Jewry considers it lias a
genuine grievance against the “Pocket Oxford Dic-
tionary” which proclaims to the world, amongst other
things, that “Jew” stands for “unscrupulous usurer
or bargainer,” and that to “Jew” is to cliea..,
over-reach or Other dictionaries ha\e
softened the blow by admitting that these are
the “opprobrious” uses of the word; but tne Oxford
makes no such reservation. The Chief Rabbi
officially protested; but the lexicographers replied
that the item was no more a reflection on a people
than such phrases as “Dutch courage,” “French leave,
or “a nation of shopkeepers.” Jewry is m no way
appeased by the explanation.
“Wealsman”: Hobart has been enjoying a joke,
provided by the dear, sober old Mercury. Early
last month the paper had a regular day out with its
Yellow Pup, and filled its leader column with the
strongest arguments it could find against the proposal
to appoint James O’Grady, M.P., as Governor ot Tas.
Chief among these was the O’Grady’s Roman Catholic-
ism A few day's later, O’Grady having meantime
become Sir James, the quaint old journal dug into
its ancient files for a suitable reprint for its Fifty
Years Ago” column, and found this protest against
the attitude of certain local heavyweights of the
year 1874 towards the proposed appointment of W eld
as Governor of Tasmania:—
“But, alas! he is a Roman Catholic —a .sort of
religious leper in the estimation of certain Tas-
manian Protestants. We cannot imagine a greater
libel upon a body of Englishmen than to say that
their reception and treatment of any gentleman who
may coins amongst thorn will bo influoncod by
religion. Surely in this latter half of the nine-
teenth century, w'e are not going to value a man
accordingly as he worships God in this way or in
that. .. . Public opinion in the Island must be in a
very low and lamentable state indeed We shall
expect after this reflection on their liberality and
good taste, that the men of Tasmania, as distinguished
fiom the old women, will unite in giving Mr. Weld
such a welcome as will mark their emphatic dis-
approval of any attempts to prejudice individuals,
no matter whether high or low, on account of their
faith.”
But perhaps the Mercury is old enough to be excused
occasional lapses of memory.
“Abbot Park”; W. J. Locke, in his recent “The
Coming of Amos,” introduces an Australian as
libellous as anything perpetrated by Galsworthy (B.
l3/ll/’24). Although the hero comes of a pastoral
famjlv sufficiently opulent to leave him property
valued at £50,000, his speech is described as “un-
grammatical, his nerve-shattering accent a blend
of Whitechapel, the slums of Greenock, the New
York Bowery and the larrikin quarter of Sydney.”
“Would you care to have a wash-up before lunch?”
a relative in France asks his newlv-arrived kinsman.
“What for?” is the reply. “I washed this morning.”
As for his table manners; “He used his fingers largely
in place of a fork and wiped them on his clothes
instead of the napkin, as to the use of which he
seemed to be at a loss. He was as far removed
from my polite circle as an Eskimo. It was not
merely a question of manners. It was a question of
blank ignorance of conditions under which the civil-
ised world existed; conditions not only social, but
historical, geographical, artistic, economic.” Alto-
gether, the most remarkable young man who ever
left Australia 1
HEIGHTS OF KNOWLEDGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“An intimate knowledge of the succulent sausage
was betrayed by Mr. Justice Isaacs and Mr. Justice
Duffy in the High Court.”
From out their knowledge intimate,
Two learned men with words of weight
Have made a crooked matter straight
And solved a mighty mystery.
The riddle’s read; the key is found
To those discreet enigmas bound
Within a pink and clammy round;
We know their inmost history.
In vain the subtle viand tries
To fool us with its bland disguise;
Judicial heads have put us wise
To all the wiles of sausages.
Then let us in their words evince
A keen and breathless int’rest, since
They next may fathom hash and mince
And solve their dense perplexity ;
And there appears no reason why
They should not, aiming still more high,
Elucidate the common pie,
And probe its dark convexity.
And let us hope some future time
Yet greater heights the pair shall climb,
And bring us back that longed-for rhyme—-
The missing rhyme to “sausages.”

The Balloon Tyre Sensation!
Goodyear Supertwist
“SUPERTWIST,” the new cord
material perfected by Goodyear for
use in Balloon Tyres, gives to the
individual cords as much as 50 per
cent, greater elasticity.
In other words, the cord material used
in Goodyear Balloon Tyres will stretch
up to 50 per cent, more before it breaks
than the former cord used by Good-
year and other tyre manufacturers.
“Supertwist” is distinctly a Goodyear
development, and is used only by
Goodyear.
Under abnormal conditions of road
service, tests frequently show 100 per
cent, excess mileage for tyres made
from this new cord material over tyres
made of the old construction.
With the superior All-Weather Tread
and this vast improvement in the dura-
bility of the cord material, Goodyear
Balloon Tyres are beyond comparison.
This incomparable material is built into
Goodyear Balloon Tyres of both kinds
—to fit new small diameter wheels, and
to fit present rims on the majority of cars
now in use.
For better Balloon Tyres, buy Good-
years.

The “Valet” is not like other safety razors. Its blades,

become sharper with use and stay sharp for weeks and

As the chief function of a not-very-musical
comedy star is to wear next season’s dresses
for the benefit of the feminine part of the
audience, “Betty,” the kitchenmaid who
commenced her timid assault on the citadels
of English aristocracy at Sydney Majesty’s
on Saturday, did not provide full measure
until the second act; after that she more
than made up for starting late. From a
merely histrionic point of view she was more
satisfactory as a denizen of the servants’
hall than of the best parlor. As a soft,
shrinking, unsophisticated country mouse
who has got a job in the big town house of
the abandoned rouh (Gerard, the Earl), she
brought tears of commiseration to every eye,
and when the dissolute young limb fixed liis
rapacious eye upon lier every heart stood
still. When, however, the irascible Duke of
Crowborough (Field Fisher), father to
Gerard, enraged at his son's refusal to marry,
presented him with an ultimatum in tho
middle of a supper-party, declaring that if
lie did not exchange present bad company
for a life-partner within 18 hours he would
be disowned, everybody breathed easily once
more, having no further doubts as to the
ultimate happy aud respectable consumma-
tion of tlie relations between the principals,
whatever vicissitudes would be necessary to
keep the play spinning through two more
acts. Nobody, likewise, was perturbed when
Gerard sent his new-made bride, despite her
ravishing appearance in her bridal plumage,
off to his country seat immediately after
the ceremony, to have the honeymoon on her
own, and declared his intention of never
seeing her again.

ploited a hesitating manner and a pretty

of Beverley, into matrimony. Hugh Steyne,

as the Hod. Victor Halifax, and Maggio
Jarvis, as a lady, presented a presumably
accurate picture of the British aristocracy’s
attitude towards the country’s most sacred
institution; and Alfred Frith, as Lord
Playne, maintained a devastating commen-
tary, with a flavor in it of G. B. Shaw, plus
a dash of Oscar Wilde, on everything and
everybody, though the humor of his dialogue
with a deaf parrot is doubtless the creation
of his own hilarious fancy. Cecil Kellaway,
as Jotte, a celebrated dressmaker, diversified
the dulness of the wedding morning by in-
troducing a chorus of a dozen girls with a
dozen glory-boxes; and Winnie Collins, as
Estelle, his head model, complicated matters
by having a love affair with Jotte.

Paul A. Rubens composed the music, but
nfissed most of his opportunities: his hunt-
ing song, however, was a cheerful ditty.
Cunningham and Hazel Clements gave a dis-
play of modern wrestling which the pro-
gramme described in two places as a dance,
and which the audience received with tumul-
tuous appreciation.

The new Prince Edward Theatre, Sydney,
started upon its picture-show career by re-
leasing “The Ten Commandments,” a stupen-
dous affair produced by Cecil de Mille. The
film is divided into two parts. In the first
a couple of hundred lean Israelites are haul-
ing an image-laden waggon across the sand
when the proceedings open, a burly taskmaster
tickling them with a whip as they plough
along. Moses at this stage appears and ap-
peals to Rameses 11. to cease putting the
boot into his brethren, with the result that
the tribe gets it in the neck worse than ever.
The story then follows “Exodus” pretty
closely, including the flight from Egypt, the
crossing of the Red Sea —a very remarkable
piece of cinema trickery this—Moses receiv-
ing the tables, the worshipping of the Golden
Calf, and finally the disgusted Moses losing
his head and smashing the decalogue. In
its display of the pomp of the Pharaohs the
prologue is a wonderful screen achievement.
But when the story takes a jump of 8000-
odd years into modern San Francisco, it de-
velops into mush; and you leave with the
impression that you have seen an elephant
harnessed n.P with a rat. The orchestra is
under the baton of AVill Prior, and its ren-
dering of Rubinstein’s “Kamenoi Ostrow,”
the choral march-theme in Felicien David's
“Da Desert,” and the sombre “Kol Nidrei”
was entirely enjoyable.
** * *
At Sydney Opera House “Broadway Jones”
tears along the primrose path of a young
man about town in little old New York, the
absence of any speed limit for actors enabling
Seymour Hicks to break all pace records for
four acts.

“Wildfiower” succeeds “The Cousin from
Nowhere” at Sydney Royal on Saturday, with
Marie Burke to lead the romantic revels and
something particularly ip Spanish dances to
console the connoisseurs of the stalls for the
loss of the tripping Tulips.

“East of Suez” is still regaling Sydney
Cri. audiences with the spicy smells and
tinkling music of the Orient, and familiaris-
ing them with the passions and sex problems
that add so many raisins to the pudding
of life in those latitudes.

No water has been added to the Sydney
Tivoli’s drink this week. Charlotte Parry
still does an astonishing quick-change turn;
Scott and Whaley go from the comparative
to the superlative degree in “The Case for
the Defence,” a highly amusing turn packed
with machine-gun repartee; and Fred Lake
contributes a good voice, and Lavern and
Cross a burlesque of ancient Roman games
and characters.

At Melbourne Royal the canary which
provides its merry chirp at regular intervals
in Act I continues to do its little bit to
make “Kempy” a popular success.

Melbourne will be sadder for the loss of
the popular Dot Brunton and her cheerful
assistants after next Saturday, when “Tons
of Money” will be given its last performance.
The New Princess’s will then join the New
Palace in darkness for a space.
The supercession of “Aren’t We All?” by
“The Truth About Blayds” is imminent; but
the play which gives an airing to the Great
Australian Adjective is still drawing public
favor. A yarn told about it is of a
young man who ’phoned a friend to ask the
question: “How about going to the blanky
play, to-night?” Came the prompt 'answer :
“I’m on. I’ll meet you in front of the
King’s at a quarter to eight.”

The popular appreciation of Gladys Mon-
crieff’s return and the revival of the “Maid
of the Mountains” has been such that origi-
nal intentions have been tossed overboard,
and the “Maid” is reigning for an extra six
nights. On Saturday “The Merry Widow”
is to take charge of Melbourne Majesty’s.

Melbourne Philharmonic Society gave a
very disappointing rendering of Handel’s
“Israel in Egypt” at the Town Hall last
week. A crowded audience was attracted;
but in every way the performance fell far
below expectations, in spite of some heroic
work on the part of the basses. As a pre-
lude, Coleridge Taylor’s “Ballade in A
Minor” was well rendered by the Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra; but it was hardly an
appropriate opening, and in its more serious
work the players fell off sadly. The spirit
of the great musical work seemed lost by
soloists, chorus and orchestra except in one
or two passages—-the Hailstone Chorus was
very well rendered indeed, and there was
enthusiasm after the singing of “But As for
His People.” Miss Mabel White failed in
the soprano solo, “Thou Didst Blow with the
Wind.” and in the beautiful duet “Thou in
Thy Mercy” Miss Temple (contralto) and
Albert Emery seemed overwhelmed by the
spirit of gloom. Nevertheless, Mr. Emery
was the best of the soloists, and in “The
Enemy Said” was very nearly successful.
Alexander Raff and A. R. Loveless sang first
and second bass without sufficient spirit;
and even Alberto Zelman seemed unable to
get in touch with the forces he had to control.

Melbourne Tivoli programme calls for more
variety. There are two juggling turns and
the magic of Oswald Williams; and magic
and juggling are close relations. The
newest of these acts, however, is artistically
presented; the active partner in Van Cello
and Mary lies on his back and toys with tubs
and sundries on his exalted toes to a musi-
cal accompaniment, and the rhythm of it is
most intriguing. Several of the turns are

by indulging a belief that he is a competent

It is a poor students’ concert which can’t
draw a full house of enthusiastic friends to
supply applause to budding genius in your
own or a friend’s family; but the show-out of
the pupils of the Melbourne Conservatorium
of Music at the Assembly Hall last week
needed few apologies. Helped by Harold
Elvins at the second piano, Roy Shepherd did
very well with the first movement of Ruben-
stein’s D Minor Concerto, and there was
grace and expression in the interpretation of
Mendelssohn’s concerto by Miss White.
In a very long programme, mainly consisting
of songs, Cora O’Ferrall scored best in a
Handel aria. A feature was an offering of
two songs written by a student, Dorothy
Ilallam. Joyful youth always appears in-
clined to turn to gloom under the spur of
inspiration ; but the young lady’s “A Trio-
let,” in which she has an unseasonable mourn-
ing for dead roses—-roses are blooming quite
nicely in Melbourne now—is pleasing.
** * *
Melbourne was given further reasons for
being proud of energetic Fritz Hart at
Harold Elvins’s recital of his friend’s works
at the Masonic Hall last week. The “Pan-
ludes” are musical juggling justified by under-
lying harmony; and they are full of bright,
fresh imagery. Another Hart item was less
satisfactory: it suggested the spirit of music
with bobbed hair and the other concomitants
of the modern flapper; yet it is a clever com-
position. In the rest of the programme
Elvins wandered from Bach’s majestic “Organ
Concerto in D Minor” to Aaron Copland’s
“.Scherzo Humoresque”; the closing “study”
of Saint Saens showed the brilliancy of the
pianist better than any other item.

At Melbourne Majestic “The Fire Patrol”
features two women stars in Anna Q. Nilson
and Madge Bellamy in a film which intro-
duces a fine effect of fire-fighting at sea ; and
the curious are invited to gain some psycho-
logical knowledge from "Women Men Marry.”
At Hoyt’s De Luxe “The Perfect Flapper”
exhibits herself for the benefit of those who
believe that no flapper is perfect and others ;
and “Young Ideas” is a hilarious supporting
feature.

A combined Melbourne show:—
There is a lot of nice work in the small show of
water-colors and etchings on view at the Decoration
Galleries, to which the consistently careful Harold
Herbert is the main contributor. All his nine offer-
ings are good, and the flattery of imitation is given
by another exhibitor who has evidently retired from
the attempt to paint for himself. A Heysen work is
really a fine thing; and there is a well-handled lan.!-
scape by Daryl Lindsay. W. D. Knox, Cavlyl
Jackson, J. W. Tristram, Ralph Warner, Sydney Ur
Smith and Gwen Barringer are other contributors;
and three drawings by Norman Lindsay are, as
usual, a provocative feature.
And another:—
John Longstaff is indicated as a member of the
Society of Twenty Melbourne Painters, but he exhibit'
nothing at the society’s show at the Queen’s Hail,
Collins-street; and the 20 who have pictures hung
also exhibit nothing worth talking about. The pain' -
ings are not representative examples of the work of
the various artists; they are uninspired and stodgy,
and it is really no recommendation of the unimport-
ant trifles he submits to mention John Rowell's
“Miners’ Cottages, Black Hill,” and “An Old Bridge”
as about the best. It is rather a criticism of the rest.
* * *
“The Lilies of the Field,” the Adelaide
Repertory’s last production for the year, is
one bright but artificial idea, which Hast-
ings Turner has planted in a wilderness of
talk. Worldly Grandma has offered one of
the twins from a country vicarage a month
in London; which one is to be decided by
a visiting antiquarian, though he isn’t to
know it. Unworldly father lets* out the
secret plan, and the girls agree on a keen
though sporting contest. One of them wins
it by adopting early-Victorian costume and
behavior. The antiquarian (being well on
the right side of 40) pursues her to London,
where she has to keep up the pose, and sees
it score an immense social success. At the
end of three long acts he gathers her in, re-
marking merely that he had seen through
her bluff from the first, and (after the style
of “The Amazons” long ago) an amiable
wealthy idiot is provided for the other sister.
Obviously this frivolous stuff is not Reper-
tory work at all, and, while the public wel-
comed it and rushed both performances, the
players did not catch the necessary lightness
of touch —though, as already implied, the
author is a bit to blame. Honorable excep-
tions were Beryl Kook and Thelma Baulder-
stone as the twins, Ethelwyn Robin as epi-
grammatic Grandma, and Basil Harford as
the lover. The others gave just a creditable
amateur performance; and the Adelaide Rep.
standard is higher than that.
** * *
Allen Doone, at Adelaide Royal—witli one
interval for refreshment in “The Parish
Priest”—has been playing, under a changed
name, the old comedy of a champion bar-
tender who became a champion anti-booze
lecturer from sheer dislike of the local brewer,
lie takes the part in a gentle, humorous
style which is highly popular, and he is well
supported, three elderly-men parts being par-
ticularly well played.

A Brisbane picture show :
Vice-regal art, mainly domestic, is a feature of the
Queensland Art Society’s exhibition in the annex of
the Wintergarden Theatre. Mrs. George Nathan has
been painting his Ex., Jack Turner, H. M. Saunders,
Michael Rogers and Lyn McPhie; and daughter
Pamela contributes a study of a girl’s head. In the
same group are some mining pictures made in China,
and a Japanese card game, which excited interest.
Jeanette Sheldon’s landscapes delighted by thei:
charm and modest price. “Crossing the Bay,” “Silvery
Jlorn,” and “Morning on the Bay” have atmosphere.
“BETTY,” AT SYDNEY MAJESTY’S.
Winnie Collins as Estelle, a model , receives
instruction on aristocratic deportment
from Cecil Kellaway as Jotte, a dress-

Gwendolyn Grant scores with a bit of mother earth
in oils, and Vera Hamilton glorifies Currumbin and
Palm Beach. Hubert Jarvis is of the good wine
that needs no bush, and so are Bennett and Bustard.
Frank Payne supplies the most important figure-
work in oils, one being a very winsome bride; and
Hobday has some fetching gums. Tom Alban’s
“Clash of Wills,” a dinkum stockman on a bucking
outlaw, is good poster stuff and full of action.
Mclnnes and others help with loaned pictures to
make this the best window the Society has dressed
to date.

Now, let us take the case of the woman who buys
simply on the “lowest price” basis. Naturally, she
cannot expect to obtain anything but “cheap” (Arti-
ficial Silk Stockings, nor can she reasonably antici-
pate that they 0 will add to her appearance or prove
really dependable in wean
The only definite advant-
age she receives is that her
immediate outlay is limit-
ed to a small amount.
The certain aftermatn is an
accumulation of stockings,
ill of which are in a semi
worn-out state, while only
a small percentage can be
made presentable, even by
the use of needle and
thread. If the total expend-
iture they represent were
considered, it would be found
that the same amount would
have been much more wisely
invested in silk stockings that,
though the initial cost was
higher, would have possessed
the lasting advantage of giv-
ing good service.
c"THE Question of Silk Hosier /* Economy r is
1 not lightly solved by making a practice of
purchasing the lowedi priced stockings
offered.
Quite often, very low price is merely a spe-
cious attraction which, in actual fact, is the
enemy of economical expenditure. And this is the
reason why it is quite true that sometimes “one pair
of silk stockings is better than two.

“Ganso”: Some of Shakspeare’s language
has to be cut out or modified to suit modern
ideas, but the process can be overdone. In
"As You Like It” Rosalind says : “Very good
orators, when they are out, they will spit.”
In the Allan Wilkie performance at Sydney
Palace Miss Hunter-Watts replaced “spit”
by “cough.” There is such a thing as being
too refined in these matters.
“GOOD-BYE-EE.”
ARTIST : “Can I see you for a moment?"
EDITOR: “You can, and Hie moment's up.”
“Flaming Youth”: The Dopularity of the
sketch in modern vaudeville is revealed in
some figures prepared by the Melbourne
livoli management. During 14 months 161
acts were presented at the Tivoli and 35 ot
them were sketches. The performers num-
bered 304, 199 belonging, to the sex that cul-
tivates bald spots. Topnotchers in the theat-
rical profession make no bones about appear-
ing in vaudeville sketches nowadays. Those
now presenting them in London include
George Arliss and Barrymore. And I have
heard it said (although the thing is almost
incredible) that one or two sketches have
been written in Australia.
“Charlik”: Now that “prologues” to spec-
tacular pictures have caught on, so much
so that the fashion is creeping into vaude-
ville, why don't some of our musicians and
producers stage a real ballet? A ballet with
a story, neither Russian nor tragic; a fairy
story—“ Beauty and the Beast,” for example.
We have any number of gifted pantomimists
and dancers waiting for just such opportuni-
ties, and the music would not die when the
ballet had outlived its popularity. Delibes’
“Sylvia” and “Coppelia” are still enchanting.
I offer this suggestion to Alfred Hill, Arthur
Benjamin (if he hasn’t left us altogether)
and others. One of the two Minnies, per-
haps both, would look after the rest. Minnie
Everett in Australia is the legitimate suc-
cessor of Tvatti Banner in London; and
Minnie Hooper is not far behind.
“F.L.H.”: One reason for the disappear-
ance of the bass voice (B. 20/11/’24) is that
modern composers do not write for it. The
smoothly flowing aria that the old-timers
loved to sing has no place in contemporary
music drama. The golden age of the bass
voice seems to have been the ’fifties, wheu
Lablaclie, Marini, Formes and Susini (Aus-
tralia knew him subsequently) were on
top. For all that. I don’t think the real
bass is obsolete. What about Robert Rad-
ford and Norman Allin in England? Aus-
tralian opera-goers of 20 years ago will re-
member Travaglini. His “Within These
Holy Portals” was a treat. W. G. Barker,
a Melbourne basso, was fine in that solo
and similar work, and his low D could fill
any large hall; a great career seemed in store
for Barker, but brain trouble carried him
off before he was 30. As regards the recent
opera season, had Huberdeau enjoyed good
health while in these parts lie would. I
think, have satisfied “Charlik” as to his
profound notes. Azzolini was in his right
place as a basso-comico.
“Caesar’s. Ghost" : Himself a .Tew, Mosco*
vitch will introduce to Australia a .Shylock
very different from others this country has
seen. Irving might say that Shvloek was
the only gentleman in “The Merchant of
Venice”: he still made the .Tew merely an
elderly fanatic. The Shylock of Mosco-
vitch’s interpretation is middle-aged, vigor-
ous, proud of his race, and keen to avenge
its wrongs on the Venetian larrikins who
pester his brethren. The actor is fluent in
seven languages, and has played “The Mer-
chant” in every one of them.
There isn't anything of interest to woman
that the Woman’s Mirror isn't interested in ;
so, of course, the theatres have a section in
the 64 pages that make up the new three-
penny weekly. In the first issue there is a
beautifully illustrated article in which Miss
Hunter-V atts talks of the parts she plays
in the Allan Wilkie productions, and how
each of them appeals to her; in next week’s
number there wall be a talk with Elsa Stralin.
the South Australian, who is already in the
world’s front rank of singers: and week by
week there will be intimate talks by leading
actresses about the stage and the‘plays in
.which they have figured.
“Lud”: Odd that “Darley Street” (B.
20/11/’24) should mention the singing of
Her Golden Hair Was Hanging Down Her
Back ’ in George Edwardes’s production of
The. Shop Girl ’ when the singer is at pre-
sent in Sydney. Seymour Hicks, to wit.
. “Ant II.”: Henry Jewett (B. 13/11/’24)
is a native of Maoriland. He left Australia
32 years ago under contract to play six
months in San Francisco, and got on so
well that, although, he often thought of re-
turning to Australia, his work held him to
America until he finally anchored in the
Repertory movement at Boston. There the
Frances Jewett Repertory Theatre Club was
founded, and in the course of eight years
Jewett, with the devoted help of' his 'Aus-
tralian wife, has produced 153 plays, mixing
Shakspeare, Goldsmith. Sheridan. Shaw (If)
plays), Pinero (9). Galsworthy (7), Milne
(6), Maugham (5), Ibsen (3). Zangwill,
Barrie, Granville Barker. Bennett, Oscar
A ilde, Sutro, McEvoy, A. H. Jones and
many others. John Drinkwater pronounced
this to be the finest list of plays produced
m any English-speaking theatre in the world.
Jewett is far too busy a man to be a “spell-
binder for the Drys,” as “T. 0.1.” alleges.
He and his wife are teetotallers, and have
been for 20 years, but that is their private
affair.
“W.E.”: “J.F.11.” (B. 23/10/’24) asks
how many Australians can remember Walter
Montgomery. I can, for one; I saw Walter
perform many times at the old Prince of
Wales’s Opera House (now the Theatre
Royal). Sydney, in 186 S. Montgomery was
a favorite with the Duke of Edinburgh, then
visiting Sydney, and when “Hamlet” was on
the. bill two of the Duke’s staff—the Hon.
Elliott Yorkc and Lieut. I-laigh—supported
the star as Laertes and Horatio respectively.
That was the theatre which was destroyed
by fire in January. 1872.
Dr. Nil touches some memory-chords:—
There have been curious changes in the composition
anu methods of orchestras since the writer played in
one 10 years ago. In the orchestra conducted bv
Kirby, the elder, in Aberdeen—we had for principal
singers Madame Sherrington, Antoinette Stirling,
Fob, Santley, Mary Davies and Edward Lloyd—there
were, six first fiddles, six second ditto, one viola,
two cellos, one double bass, two cornets, two clarion-
ettes, oboe, flute and piccolo, bassoon (when we
could get one), French horn, trombone, bombardine
and sometimes euphonium, with bass and kettle
drums, triangle and cymbals. The strings were
arianged in a semi-circle round the conductor: first
violins to his left, second to his right, and the
others in front of him. The wood and brass-wind
were outside these again, and the drums and per-
cussion at the back. If it is true, as I read, that
modern composers aim at combined effects as opposed
to those of individual instruments, I should think
the old-fashioned grouping must have been better
for that purpose than the massing of all the strings
on one side and the wind on the other, as seems to be
the way preferred now. In the recent orchestras, one
finds, in addition to the foregoing instruments, the
HAD TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE.

Rivoli.”

stepped in."
cor anglais, saxophone, “trumpets” (instead of
cornets), bass trombone, tuba and harp, not to
mention the xylophone and sundry jazz implements.
Whether their presence improves matters much let
experts decide. But there is one modern alteration
in musical manners that most people are thankful for,
and that is the tuning up of the band before it
swims into the audience’s lien. Asa child I used to
delight in the wild cacophony produced by the
orchestra for a few minutes before the curtain went
up on “Blue Beard, or Harlequin Humpty Dumpty
and the Fifteen Bloodstained Bandits,” but now 1
bless the man who first insisted upon his players
getting through their musical collywobbles before
they came on deck.
“Hottentop”: Bland Holt (B. 13/11/’24)
is in liis own quiet way a victim of the moving-
picture craze. Living- in liis comfortable
retirement at Kew (Vic.), Bland rarely goes
to the theatre, but runs a little cinema
show at home for the entertainment of the
household. The old manager got a surfeit
of the stage when he was on it. With big
productions on hand he used to haunt the
theatre all day. and at times he would be
there until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning,
holding inquests into mishaps that had
occurred during a performance. No wonder
the time came when he grew sick of the
sight of a playhouse!
“F.T.K.” : I remember that production of
"Carmen” at Sydney Lyceum in 1898 men-
tioned by “Hambone” and “B.B.” (B.
?3/10/’24). Lilian Tree. Edward Farley and
May Glendenning were the leads, with Rivers
Allpress conducting ; and a minor member of
the company was Bert Bailey, who sang
quite decently and acted on the broad comedy
lines which in later years he developed. As
far as I know it was Bert’s one appearance
in grand opera. What a Pasquale he would
have made! “Carmen” lasted a week, and
the season petered out with “Maritana” and
“The Bohemian Girl.” Financially the thing
was a failure, and but for the unusual genero-
sity of Lilian Tree, Farley and Allpress in
t
surrendering their £60-a-week salaries the
ghost wouldn’t have walked for the chorus
and the staff.
“Nikko”: The landlady was very decided
about it. “No,” she said haughtily, “I never
take that class in now. I’m done with theat-
ricals. I lost my best boarder through them.
Old Mr. Tomkins. A bit peculiar, but gave
me his five guineas a week regular, year in
and year out. He had a fancy for a cold
bath at 5 o’clock in the morning, and the
maid used to turn the bath on at five to.
Well, it was when I had Miss Birdie Bright
staying here, and she comes back from the
theatre with about six bunches of roses, and
Puts them in the bath. The girl turned the
tap on in the dark, and old Mr. Tompkins
was short-sighted, so he didn’t sec the roses
through the water. I’ll never forget his
shrieks when he sat on them. He left
next day. I’ve never taken in a theatrical
since.”
“Paree”: The latest Apache dance in Paris
—imported from the Argentine, as a matter
of fact —has a stunt that Eddie McLean
might envy. The
Spaniard swings
his partner wildly
by wrist and ankle
• —and lets her slip.
At the last second,
like Cinqnevalli
with a plate, lie
“retrieves” her just
before she would
strike the floor. It
is a startling effect.
The only drawback
is that, if ever it
should not come
off, anew Decima
would certainly be
required.
“Hamfat”: Proud
mention has been
made of the fact
that Percy Le Fre’s
clan has been asso-
ciated with the
stage for a hun-
dred years. Aus-
tral ia n s have
known many mum-
mers with a thes-
pian family history
which goes back
further than that.
There was Gus
Glover, very popu-
lar in his day. one
of whoso forebears
was a noted actor
in Garrick’s time.
And some of the
family claim kin-
ship, not only with
the eighteenth-cen-
tury Glover, but
with that Better-
ton who was the
leading actor in the
London of Charles
11-—Charles who
m ashed Nell
Gywn ne, Lady
Castlemain, the
Kerouaille and half a hundred others.
Machete”: Mention of Walter de Freer
as "Vesta Tilley’s husband” (B. 13/11/’24)
is a reminder that the incomparable Vesta
luut a shy at Parliament herself soon after
Bady Astor was elected, but ran second.
V csta was the darling of Liverpool and Man-
chester panto, audiences long before she
specialised in the immaculate evening-dress
turns which made her an institution in the
London halls. I can remember her singing
Arthur Roberta s song, "Oh, You Girls,” at
Liverpool, and another of her own called
Daughters, much beloved of the Manchester
proletanat, before the Old Queen’s jubilee
m 1887. Her great triumph that year was
a patriotic ballad which had, as a refrain,
the pious aspiration :
May good Queen Victoria, reign,
stay she with us long remain,
Till ballet girls’ clothes
Reach down to their toes,
May good Queen Victor-ier re-i-g-n.
Ihc wonderful little woman was 60 last
May. and wasn’t ashamed to admit it.
pecker’s “Hassan.” which was so
well liked when put up at London Her

Grossmitli and Malone, the London pro-
pnetors of the play, sent over the principals
oi tlie cast, and several of them, according
to report, proved duds. Anyhow, the acting
was roundly condemned by American critics,
and the piece was taken off after the 16th
performance. It is to be shown in Australia
next year; Tallis, of the Firm, has bought
the original London sceneryfor the production.
"Domain Dramatist”: Seymour Hicks is

THE IMPROVED VARIETY.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘ln the British film,’ said Professor Wallace, ‘the
kiss is a hearty smack that is soon over. The
British husband says goodbye to his wife with no
more than an honest peck. The American film kiss
is an affair of ceremony. The hero settles down
to his job as if it were an all-day affair.’ ”
The British kiss, as most befits
A highly moral nation,
Is a coy bird that seldom sits,
But shyly comes and quickly flits,
And in an instant takes and quits
Its brief, uneasy station ;
’Tis a platonic, pure caress,
Defiled by no impassioned stress,
Nor higli in ardor rated ;
But in the transatlantic range
Its being suffers a sea-change;
Like Bottom, ’tis translated.
Chaste, sober salutations! Oh,
Endearments passing mild,
That folk respectable bestow,
Stiffen your souls to meet the blow:
1 fear me that you’d never know
Your Los Angelic child;
That is no modest British buss
Given and taken without fuss;
For there artistic zeal
Has made of osculation quite
A long-drawn, ceremonious rite,
A veritable meal.
As scientists with cunning art
New fruits delicious bring
From ancient stocks once almost bare,
So ardent students with a flair
For hugs, experimenting there
Evolved the luscious cling
And tender slobber that impart
The rapture of the loving heart
(In some great, five-reel spec.).
Oh, some amazing fruits, I ween,
Those wizard Burbanks of the screen
Have raised from that tough thing and green
The honest British peck.

BY ORDER OF SENATOR THE RIGHT HONORABLE G. F. PEARCE, P.C., MINISTER FOR HOME
AND TERRITORIES, COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.
THE TERRITORY FOR THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT.
CANBERRA,
THE CAPITAL CITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
FIRST SUBDIVISION AND AUCTION SALE OF CANBERRA LEASES, TERM NINETY-NINE YEARS.
COMPRISING 104 BUSINESS LOTS
AND
289 RESIDENTIAL LOTS,
TO BE SOLD BY PUBLIC AUCTION, ON THE GROUND AT
CANBERRA,
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1924.
AN EVENT OF HISTORIC IMPORTANCE
enabling buvers to secure at the FIRST SALE CHOICE HOME AND BUSINESS SITES in the FIRST CITY
OF THE COMMONWEALTH. CANBERRA, BECAUSE of its MAGNIFICENT SITUATION anrl DELIGHT-
FUL CLIMATE, is destined to become the MECCA OF THE COMMONWEALTH. AN EXCELLENT
OPENING presents itself for the establishment of RETAIL BUSINESS, RESIDENTIAL FLATS, or PRO-
FESSIONAL CHAMBERS, as at present there are no local facilities. ALREADY approximately £2,000,000
has been spent by the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT in BUILDINGS and SERVICES, PARLIAMENT
HOUSE, nearing completion at a cost of about £225,000. A HOSTEL costing about- £140,000 will
shortly be available for guests. MODERN POWER-HOUSE. Excellent Water Service, Sewerage and
Electric Light and Power. Golf Links and Recreation Reserves. It is proposed that early in 1926 Parlia-
ment will meet at Canberra, and this involves the transfer of over 350 officials, in addition to Members of
Parliament. Allowing for families and subsidiary population, this would represent an addition of about
1000 people to the existing population of the city area, which, including workmen, already approximates
1500 persons. BEFORE the end of 1929 PERMANENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES will have been
completed, and the transfer of officials undertaken. A conservative estimate of the population of LAN-
BERRA in 1929 is: Civil Servants, 1000; their dependants, 1500; unofficial population, 2500; total,
5000 Within a decade the population will probably reach from 10,000 to 15,000, thus equalling cities
of the size of ALBURY, WAGGA, GOULBURN, or BATHURST A RESiDENCE will be; provided for
THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL at CANBERRA, and it is expected that the CAPITAL CITY will be the
SOCIAL CENTRE for a large portion of the year. INTENDING BUYERS wishing to inspect the sites
please call on WOODGERS AND CALTHORPE, QUEANBEYAN. PLANS AND PARTICULARS regarding
LEASES, BUILDING COVENANTS, and CONDITIONS are available at the offices of THE COMMON-
WEALTH SURVEYOR-GENERAL, Goldsbrough House, 5 Macquarie Place, Sydney; THE LOjI.MuJS-

The Farmer’s Greatest Asset at Harvest
“Cletrac” has been' aptly termed “The Iron
Horse that Never' Tires,” working as it does
for 365 days in the year, if necessary, and
replacing eight horses on the farm' Particu-
larly at HARVEST TIME is “detracts”
utility evidenced by its remarkable capacity
for Stripping the Crop, Hauling In and
Threshing the Grain, thus Saving Time, Labor
and Money. Between seasons, “CJetrac" is
fitted for endless use about the farm —pump-
ing, cleaning tanks, sawing wood, etc. It runs
economically on, kerosene and is ever ready
for the job.

Peter W.: Thanks; but you're too late.
. ...Marlaw: You’ve got things to say; now see
if you can’t marshal them.... Old Pall: He’s had
all the space we can spare.... Capta: Too 5ma11....
Salvarsan: Three times too long; and that’s being
liberal W.R.M,: But how many times has it all
been said!.... Frankly: “Whiskies” is watered down
a bit too much... .Booth B.: Too weak a conclusion.
... .H.E.E.H.: Not much in our line... .K. 8.: “Fear”
has merits, but not quite the strength to push
through.... Chris C.: Well enough done; but you
don't make it credible... .John K. P. S.: But Mel-
bourne has got such a society—at least three ot
them, in fact M.F.: “The calm, full voice echoed
from the luminous walls, in a soft diapason of
mellow sound”—as they buried it deep in the basket.
. ...L.M.: Might make a par... .H.E.C.: Gone!....
M.D.: No room in the Christmas stocking... .H.E.G.:
Euck out. Try again Landa: Not enough there.
A.E. (Leichhardt): “Betty” must go back to her
mother E.8.K.: Deserved better handling
Nosdoog: Fails Fred F.: The sonnet is quite off
the beaten track:—
As the rolling briny deep fades away
A fairer spene looms in bright array—
A gleaming mirror teeming with aquatic life,
Stately ships of all type rife;
Sleeping peacefully on their briny coach
Where the storm king dare not poach
Anon it floats a joyous community strain,
The song of industry and all her train,
The day-long paean of a city righteous and strong
Who to the free and the gods belong.
What voice could not sing or weep with joy,
When the gods decree it shall with pleasure and leisure
toy?
Live on, fair harbor, where beauty her art interlace
Nature’s bountiful gift to a free-born race.
... .A Bush Poet: Doesn’t move us... .Roy R.: Poor
stuff.... Eileen C.: Not badly constructed, but does
not say enough.... Scherzando: Poorly done....
T.T.R.: Pity the rest isn’t as good as the refrain.
J.M.S.Y.; No good H.G.8.; Misses, but is
somewhere on the road. .. . A.M.8.8.; The “corset
man” is without joy. .. .Charlton R.: Makes a very
thin statement.... Calidore: It falls down badly at
the usual places —the eighth and fourteenth lines.
....Paulette: “Surrender” has lines out of scan-
sion. “Impenitence” came near. The others are
poor. .. .0.5. H.: Not quite. ... S.C.S.: Doesn’t make
us want to buy you a drink.... Araunah: Not much
of an experiment. The method is fairly usual
and the matter doesn’t soar... .H.M.: One fragment
of the exquisite thing:—
See that snake there in the grass,
Step aside, unwary one,
And let the reptile pass.
There is a tiger on the prowl—
Listen! hear his growl.
With leering eye and heavy jaw
Quick, quick, or he’ll grasp you with his paw.
There’s an eagle hovering over head,
Looking for his gory prey;
Soon it will have a mountain bed
Poor lamb that gambols on the hay.
But there’s something more to fear
Than the three now mentioned here;
More venomous, more dangerous, more swift,
Every word will sting like fire
When friendship has a rift —-
’Tis the Liar. Oh, Heaven, ’tis the Liar!
.. . .8.0’C.: All the sonnets are well constructed, but
for the awful rhyme of “dawn” with “corn.” The
trouble is that nothing fresh is said... .Ripponlea:
This time the battle rages in vain. ... J.A.H.- Not
up by half a league Keith S.: A few commonplace
remarks in bad verse.... Goethe: A few commonplace
remarks in good verse.... D. 8.0.: An idea; but your
vehicle isn’t strong enough to carry it through....
8.P.D.: “The Literary Mart” is an old idea handled
in an old way 8.C.F.: Not well enough done
M.O’H.: The Vision doesn’t work out very we 11....
F.H.8.: Both fail Roy L.: Hard to understand
why merely coming out of a tunnel should make you
believe the teachings of “a sainted Jew”.... Leam-
ington: Turns on a very small point Francis C.:
They all keep to the overworked commonplace....
Dave W.: The “sea-mympth’s hide” cannot glisten
here. ... A.N.G.1.: Hardly enough point T.W.C.:
Send it to Sybil. It is entirely for home consump-
tion. .. .L.M.H.: To get into print, blank verse must
be a lot better than that. ... J.D.D.: That sigh for
the past is breathed so frequently that it needs to
have some depth of tone or special fragrance. Both
are missing in your verses, as well as some of the
sense Uniumgar; A point, but not well handled.
... .Simla: Too many corns on it... .A.J. (Redfern):
Not half the way there A.E.F.A.: Light weight.
....Bom; No doubt the ehauffeuse has come to
stay. But what that advertiser asked for was a
“domesticated ehauffeuse”... .Waverley: You will
have to get your ear tuned first.... Rex R.: If we
let you use that subject, the Anti-Sweating League
would have us prosecuted... .C.W.: Yes, but please
claim for it. We prefer to pay for what we print.
Old Hoss: You stumble over your hurdles....
G.M.L.: Those figures were the text of a sermon
some time ag0.... Will O. G.: Hasn’t quite enough
grip 0.G.M.: You’ve got a yarn, but you smother
it with words Slesy: You ask why the Nobel prize
for literature always goes to “a Norwegian, Swede,
Dutchman, Dane, Pole or Ilun.” But it doesn't:
Kipling was awarded it in 1907 and IV. B. Yeats
in 1923. Other names on the list are Anatole
France and Rabindranath Tagore.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
K. 8.: Your trees and your t.imbergetters are all
hewn out of the same material G.H.: Blue iniv
won’t' reproduce; still your females aren’t worth
reproducing, and your jokes have been reproduced
too often C.F.: There is a touch of realism about
the man on the stretcher, but your drawing is
niggling. . . .H.R.M.: No kick in it. .. .M.A.H.: lor
trotting out that old gag Henry the Eighth’s fool
was drowned in boiling 0i1... .G.G.S.: We’ll let
George Washington lie G.C.: Can’t allow a married

Broome and the man at Gabo.
“Sturt”: S.A. Criminal Court has been
considering the strange case of a regular
marriage between a brother and sister. The
pair, it appeared, were boarded out as child-
ren, and met almost as strangers when they
grew up and went to live with their mother.
After a time it became evident that a child
was to be born, on which the mother advised
them to regularise the position by matrimony.
The Law thought this made the offence con-
siderably worse, and that she had aided and
abetted a crime. The girl was released, the
man given six months,

Girls! Beautify
Your Hair
Do you know that in less than ten minutes you can double the beauty
of your hair? It becomes light, wavy, fluffy, abundant and appears as soft,
lustrous and charming as anyone could desire, after a simple wash with
Rexona Soap. A delightful surprise awaits those whose hair has been
neglected, or is scraggy, dry, brittle or thin.
Rexona Soap cleanses the hair of all dust, dirt or excess oil, and in a
few moments you have doubled the beauty of your hair. Rexona Soap
dissolves every particle of dandruff, cleanses, purifies and invigorates the
scalp, for ever stopping itching and falling hair. If you care to have pretty
hair and lots of it, get a tablet of Rexona Soap to-day.
Why Not Enjoy a
Good Complexion ?
You cannot if you do not care for the delicate skin of the face. When
you wash your face do you realise that it is not enough to simply remove the
dirt, but that your skin needs a soothing, healing influence to keep your
complexion fresh and free from blemish? Scented toilet soaps are often
very pleasant, but do not assert this influence, as you are well aware. Many
of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry up the skin and destroy its
delicate texture.
Even the better class of such soaps do not in any way help to improve
the skin, but Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is not only an absolutely pure
soap, but is medicated on the same principle as the famous Rexona Ointment,
which is famous throughout all of Australasia as the Rapid Healer. That is
why Rexona Soap really does for the skin and face what cosmetics are
supposed to do, by ensuring not only a clean face, but a pure and healthy
skin, and thus gives you a clear complexion.

“Culcairn” : At the Albury (N.S.W.) wool

“Stringy”: Re woolsacks (B. 6/11/’24),
a company is being formed in Melbourne
to manufacture this and other classes of
sacking from stringybark. It is claimed
that the fibre will not mix with the wool
to anything- like the extent it does in the
jute pack; also what little fibre does adhere
to the wool will take the dye. This new
pack is claimed to be at least twice as strong
as jute, and can be made, at half the cost,
out of what is now a waste product.
“A..L.G.” : Is this Maori business aptitude
or just milk-o’-kindness? Among a collec-
tipn of curios and other junk in the window
of a second-hand shop run by a Rotorua
native is a card declaring that “If any man
is poor through no fault of his own, I will
give him a pipe for no money—samples on
view.” The only catch I could detect iu
the benevolent offer is that the proprietor
apparently reserves for himself the right to
decide when indigence is blameless. ♦

“Videlicet”: “X2X” (B. 6/11/’24) gives

medical world’s latest fad. Yeast contains
both water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamines,
and is becoming more and more popular as a
health food. Oranges are also rich in the
mysterious properties, and the greater con-
sumption of oranges in U.S.A. coincides with
the increased popularity of yeast. Both
articles of diet could profitably be boomed
in Australia. Railways Commissioner Clapp
is doing much for the fruit in Victoria. Who

“Ambergris”: A Maorilander named
George Harrop has found strolling along the
seashore profitable as well as pleasant. He
hails from Piliama, a little village on the
Taranaki coast, 70 miles from New Ply-
mouth, with a population of 200 or so. Some
months ago, while taking pedestrian exercise
along the sands, Harrop picked up a piece
of tallow-like substance. Close examina-
tion raised thoughts of ambergris; he de-
cided to have it tested, and consigned the
441 b. lump to England. Ills little burg was
brimful of buzz the other day, when word
arrived from the Bank of New Zealand that
the find was ambergris, and that its sale had
netted £1759.
“John D.”: Captain Larsen, of the Nor-
wegian whaler Sir James Clark Ross,
reckons to scoop between 40,000 and 50,000
barrels of whale-oil out of the Ross Sea on
this his second summer’s voyage to Antarc-
tica. His ship, 13,000 tons, is the biggest
whaler afloat, and is equipped with all the
newest appliances, including adjustable
breakwaters to fix on either bow when oper-
ating on whale carcases in a rough sea.
Also, she carries the sections of a repairing
dock to be laid down at Stewart Island,
where the five lijttle whale-hunting boats are
waiting the return of their parent. Larsen
has a crew of 200, mostly Scandinavians.
But the Tasmanians who made the pioneer
trip so pleased the old man that he sacri-
ficed a day’s sailing and £lOO Commonwealth
lighthouse dues in order to put into the Der-
went and give a dozen of them a chance to
scramble aboard. Between nightfall and
midnight there was not much time for the
call to go forth; however, by dint of frantic
skirmishing all but one of the Hobart com-
plement of 12, most of whom made the pre-
vious trip, were picked up. Captain Lar-
sen’s wife is aboard, and if she doesn’t drop
off at the last moment at the Shaky Isles
she will be the first woman to go over the
top into the Antarctic circle.
“Quiz”: Never a speedster, Howard
Smith’s 40-year-old Buninyong, now to be
sold, once took nearly eight days to go from
Sydney to Melbourne. Bush fires raged
along the coast and enveloped her in smoke,
and the whistle sounded with such monoto-
nous frequency that a passenger declared the
echo of it disturbed his sleep the night after
he landed. Smoke dust settled upon the
vessel in a thick layer, and!: lady was
startled from her siesta in a deckchair by
a dying pigeon fluttering into her lap.
THE CONTRAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“The baiiKrupt admitted that he owed his tailor
40 guineas for a dress-suit and dinner jacket. He
was invited to Government House (Sydney) and
had to go properly attired.”
“Mr. Baldwin arrived at the new Cabinet’s first
meeting wearing a bowler hat and smoking a cherry-
wood pipe.”
When to courts you’re bidden —and eourtlets, too —
Take heed your raiment is rich and rare.
You must do as the aides and the courtiers do,
You must wear what the kings and the satraps wear.
Imagine the footman’s helpless stare
Should lie find a visitor on the mat
With a shilling pipe in his lips a-flare
And his rocker tiled with a bowler hat I
Conventions wither and fade, a few,
in this democratic country’s air ;
But only think of the. hullabaloo
At Government House if one ambled there—
Minister, maestro or millionaire,
For 0.8. E. or for knighthood ripe—
With a billycock on his thinning hair
And his teeth a-clench on a blackened pipe.
Did you dream of trying it ? Entre nous,
Rebel and iconoclast, forbear!
Why should you rattle the retinue
And harrow the feelings of Dud. de Chair ?
There’s a mastiff growls in his kenneled lair,
A hound who would need no sooling at
The soulless caitiff who’d entry dare
With a reeking pipe, in a low-crowned hat.
Envoy.
But where the chiefs of a nation meet,
And hands the rciiis of an Empire gripe,
There’s never a flutter in Downing-street
When a figure lobs to the highest seat
In a bowler hat, with a cherrywood pipe.

a
BUILT BY
HART-PARR COMPANY
Founders of the Tractor Industry
and Largest Exclusive Builders of
Kerosene Tractors in the World.
A Surplus-Powered
Kerosene Tractor
Built for the Farmer,
Not the expert.
SOONER or later the modern farmer must "tractorise” his
farm. And, when he buys, the wise farmer chooses
carefully after close investigation.
Increasing numbers of farmers are installing HART-PARR
Tractors after seeing them at work under the most difficult
conditions.
The following operations were successfully carried out by the
HART-PARR Tractor at the Hawkesbury College Demonstra-
tion:—Ploughing, Cultivating, Pumping, Chaffcutting and
Sawing.
THERE is no other tractor so simple for the farmer to
operate and so accessible for adjustment as the HART-
PARR. In les3 than five minutes you can get at any
working part of a HART-PARR and adjust it standing on
your feet, either on the platform or by the side of the motor.
You never have to lie on your back under a HART-PARR.
HART-PARR means lower cost, less time, better farming,
lighter labor, bigger rewards.
THE HART-PARR TRACTOR IS BUILT IN THREE SIZES:
Hart-Parr “20,” Hart-Parr “30,” and Hart-Parr “40.”
The HART-PARR Company issues to the purchaser of each one of its Tractors the following ironclad guarantee:—
We guarantee each Hart-Parr Engine to bum successfully all grades of kerosene permitted by law to be sold in Australia; that
it will burn kerosene under all conditions, regardless of weather, at all loads up to and including its rated Brake-Horsepower,
for the life of the Engine.
The above Guarantee, signed by the officials of the HART-PARR Company, is mailed to every purchaser of a HART-PARR
Tractor. It is binding for the life of the Tractor.
SURPLUS POWER. —To handle peak loads quickly, without
injury to motor.
SIMPLICITY. —For quick, easy operation—no expert needed.
ACCESSIBILITY. —For quick adjustments and replacements
—no loss of time.
STURDY CONSTRUCTION. —Assures long life and continu-
ous service.
KEROSENE BURNING.— Cuts fuel bills in half.
FRESH OIL LUBRICATION. —No burnt-out bearings—only
correct system for kerosene motors.
STEEL FRAME. —A perfect bed for motor operation.
STABILITY. —-Oldest established Tractor concern—a reputa-
tion to sustain.

When the alarm, with whiz and slam,
Puts morning dreams to flight,

That I washed up last night!”
victoria. X. B.
Lachlan Macquarie Thomson, said to have
been the first white man-child on the Lach-
lan —it is claimed that he is 103 —was intro-
duced to Prime Minister Bruce at Bathurst
the other day. The figure may be right.
VV. G. Evans discovered the Lachlan in 1813,
or 111 years ago.
An old racing record has been recalled by
the death of Norman McLeod, pioneer, sports-
man and good fellow, who died suddenly at
Mildura, aged 75. It was McLeod’s Try
Again which in consecutive annual race meet-
ings held at Wentworth (N.S.W.) in 1900
and 1901 won 13 events out of the total 14.
“Mephisto”: A little more concerning the
aura. The most enlightening research work
has been carried out by Dr. Ivilner, St.
Thomas’ Hospital, London. He has dis-
covered that a positively electrified subject
loses his aura temporarily, but that it re-
appears very much enlarged; also that the
aura of a dead person completely disappears
within a few hours of death.
“The Deacon”; Isidore (baptised James)
Larkin has worn the brown cowl of the
Franciscans since ISG6; the last 20 years
he has spent in Australia. Born in Galway
SO years ago, he received his solemn profes-
sion to the Order in Rome when Garibaldi
was bombarding the Holy City in 1870.
After various appointments abroad his broken
health was restored in sunny Australia.
“Machete”: A Casino (N.S.W.) police
constable recently dragged a youth into court
for referring to him as “old Boof.” Under
cross-examination the John admitted that
“Boofhead” was his nickname in the town,
whereupon the magistrate dismissed the
charge of insulting words on the ground that
the use of a well-known nickname could not
be considered as insulting. That seems a
debatable point, depending largely on the
nickname; but what interests me even more
is the derivation of “boof.” If it is from
the French bauf, “Oxliead” or “Bullhead”
would sound as well and mean more.
“J.G.”: The Vic. Education Department's
annual examination of those sitting for quali-
fying and merit certificates presses hard on
country children. Candidates at the school
near where I live have to walk about six
miles to another school, and, after going
through their ordeal among a lot of strange
kids and surroundings, must foot it
home again. Seeing that the district inspec-
tor visits our small school three times a
year, isn’t it possible for him to examine
the three or four children going up for their
certificates? This was the practice when I
was a nipper.
From a settler at Griffith (N.S.W.) :
Within six years the fruit-farmers of the Murrum-
bidgee irrigation areas will be spending £50,000
annually for cases, the timber for which will mostly
be imported from the U.S.A. On the banks of the
main and branch canals 250,000 to 300,000 poplars
(good case timber) could be planted. They would
require no attention after the second year, the seep-
age being sufficient to promote healthy growth. At
15 years the trees would be millable and worth, on
a conservative estimate, £1 each. Cost of planting
would be about £20,000; add compound interest
at 61 per cent. ; total, about £65,000. That
would leave a pretty decent balance with which to
build roads and things.
“T. 0.1.” : In his researches about Sydney
the late A. G. Foster (B. 13/11/’24) had
a valued co-worker in his wife, now his
widow, whose notebook and camera supplied
much of the material which the husband
worked up in his spare time. Husband and
wife, in and out of season, photographed the
most important monuments and headstones
in the Anglican part of the old Sandhills
Cemetery, carefully copying the inscriptions
and renewing those that were indistinct. The
remains and headstones were subsequently
removed to La Perouse. Much valuable work
has also been done by Mrs. Foster in photo-
graphing old buildings before demolition. She
is one of the very few women who are Fel-
lows of the Australian Historical Society.
“Wongajong”: The High Church wing of
the Church of England in Australia is at
its weakest in the diocese of Sydney, Arch-
bishop Wright being opposed to anything in
the nature of ritualistic practices. While
there are a number who lean towards the
end nearest Rome, only a lone trio can really
be classed as High Churchmen: J. F. S. Rus-
sell, Clive Statliam and A. R. Maclean.
Russell, an assistant priest at fashionable
St. James’s, is tall, thin and angular, and
altogether different from sleek and well-fed
Clive Statham, rector of Christ Church.
Christ Church, which is within a stone’s
throw of the Central Railway Station, draws
its parishioners from all over Sydney. Mac-
lean is a bachelor and an Irishman, whose
rectory at St. Saviour’s, Redfern, is the
Mecca of the High Church priests migratory,
who may be at Goulburn (N.S.W.) one
week and Bunbury (W.A.) the next.
“C.11.R.” : I have never heard of the Cutler-
Marsden welding process, referred to by “C. R.
d’Uppe” (B. 9/10/’24), but the suggestion
that electric welding was unheard of in naval
work three years ago is quite wrong. H.M.S.
Renown, being a war-built ship, was not ori-
ginally fitted with awnings. When the neces-
sary stanchions were fitted in 1919 and 1920
the old method would have involved the dis-
mantling of every officer’s cabin, most of the
mess-decks and many storerooms to enable
the dockyardmen to work in them. Actually
each heel-fitting or “shoe” was merely placed
in position on the deck, and the anode of
the electric-welder fixed it there without a
hole being drilled or a bolt or nut used. The
foreman of the gang employed told me that
the same process was in use in Portsmouth
Dockyard for spot-welding half-inch plates
by merely overlapping the edges and apply-
ing the anode where rivets would normally
be put. In the Australian Bight some big
seas smashed up a 15-ton picket-boat and
twisted a four-inch wrought-iron awning stan-
chion and its three strong stays till they
looked like Harry Lauder’s walking-stick;
but the welds never turned a hair. If the
Cutler-Marsden method can improve on this
it’s a process to write home about.

Here is a New Idea
in Tooth Paste —
Milk of Magnesia
Plaza Tooth Paste contains Sheldon’s Milk of Magnesia.
This prevents that terrible acid decay, which is indicated by the
little ridge on the surface of your teeth, along the gum line.
Milk of Magnesia also relieves and stimulates irritated gums.
This little ridge is the danger-line and is the fore
runner of decay.
Use Plaza Tooth Paste, containing Milk of
Magnesia, and see the difference.
It means not only bright, clean, attractive
teeth, but protection from decay and
tender gums.
Ask your Dentist the advantage of
Milk of Magnesia in a Tooth Paste.
He knows, and can tell you of
the benefit you will derive.

HILLIER’S
CHOCOLATES
EVERYBODY LIKES CHOCOLATES
THERE is hardly a gift that has as much personality as a box of
HILLIER’S CHOCOLATES. It somehow represents the giver, carrying
with it a suggestion of one’s own character am 1 taste.
Packed in the famous Red Box, which is a preser. Station package created to
convey, by its artistry of design and distinct color, the < quality of its contents.
The rich, smooth chocolate, made to the most exact ing standard, the wonder-
ful centres, and the many varieties, have induced pc pple to come to us tor
confectionery that is new, that is different, and that always carries a flavor
remarkably good. The results are due to many things, principally, however, to
the fact that, having realised from the beginning of this business that the public
was entitled to the BEST-QUALITY Confectionery t uat could be made, we
have devoted all our energies to making it so.

Bloody BUI.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HO! are you there, Bill Hawkins,
Below the cruising shark,
Down with the ribbon frost-fish
In dungeons of green dark?
Old Bloody Bill, you rover,
Where is your Devil school
Combed from foul dens and brothels
By crimps of Liverpool?
Here over Port Moeraki
The heavens still are blue;
An amethystine ocean
Runs north to Oamaru.
Oh many times and hoarsely
You damned the leadsmans soul
Who told the ebbing fathoms
On the uncharted shoal;
And twice in midnight smother
From keelson linto truck
You felt the mounting shiver
When the brave whaler struck.
Now to old Port Moeraki
No more the captains come
Salt as the junk they fed on,
Cured in Jamaica rum.
Remember how 7 , carousing,
Into the pail of gin
Between loud oath and laughter
We dipped the pannikin?
Though red of eye and drunken
The hogs went to their swill,
One ever looking seaward
Kept watch on Flagstaff Hill.
And drunk or sober, Haw 7 kins,
You bent men to the oar.
For there w r as naught to hinder
Of law beyond the shore.
The try-pots now 7 are rusted —
Rusted and overturned —
And dark and damp the charcoal
Lies where the red fire burned.
The grand old fleet lias vanished,
All save some rotting bones,
Along the coasts that harbor
The keels of Johnnie Jones;
Where Abel Jansen Tasman
His frightened northw 7 ay took,
Where gleaming Nick’s Head beaconed
The bay for Captain Cook.
Flaunting your God-defiance,
All merciless you sailed
To harry and to plunder
Wherever wrong prevailed.
God know r s how you went scathless
Past pirates of Malay
To cram your hold w 7 ith blackbirds
Dow 7 n Raratonga way!
You lie down there, Bill Hawkins,
With red blood on each hand,
Nor can the currents clean them
Nor can the drifting sand.
And yet with you, old sailor,
What paltry feud have I?
You chose the rover’s living.
His bold, brave way to die.
To make a future Eden
The killers first must come
To tame unfriended peoples
With lust and lash and rum.
And Christ must follow after
And walk the water-way
When want lias stung the heathen
Or greed has made him pray.
Here now 7 your son, Bill Hawkins,
Makes rioting his sport;
Your daughter leads the halca,
The lithest moll in port.
And yonder one-eyed Susan
Has all the coast in view
From Blueskin Bay, far southward,
Right north past Oamaru.
She sleeps; and, damned or salvaged,
Best fitted to God’s will,
You called the tune, Bill Hawkins,
And paid for Bloody Bill.
MAORILAND.
DARIUS.
The Rival Gods.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
QUONG PI was a married man and a
father. Being poor, he kept but one
wife, and had a son, aged eight, than
whom there was nothing more wonderful
under the skies. Quong owned his mud-
and-thatch hut, and worked from daylight to
starlight in the quarter-acre of ground sur-
rounding it to produce the wherewithal to
feed wife and son. He did not gamble; a
most unusual virtue in a Chinaman. Neither
did he smoke; a still more unusual virtue.
Yet, despite these virtues, Quong Pi was
a heathen. According to the Rev. Arthur
Bagley, at any rate. A heathen on two
counts. Firstly, because he did not believe
in the true God, the white man’s God, who
understood and could remedy all things; and,
secondly, because the crop lie so assiduously
cultivated in his garden was the baneful
poppy, the direful plant wdiicli kept his,
Quong’s, people in the lowest depths of degra-
dation and despair. Again and again the
Reverend Bagley had wrestled with Quong
and tried to show him the evil of his ways.
But with a wife to cook for him, a garden
to feed him and a son to worship at his
grave wdien he was dead, Quong was content,
and always turned a deaf ear to the reverend
gentleman’s preachings. There was another
reason why Quong w 7 as content with his own
god. Work as he might, seven days a week
and all day, Quong could produce barely
sufficient to fill the stomachs of himself and
liis family To have missed a (lay would
have meant catastrophe. And his own g od
did not demand that he miss a day. A a
therein he was more considerate than
Reverend Bagley’s God, who demanded that
every man miss one day mev y ’ .
Eh his family .starved because of the
many seventh days in every yea . P the
hand Ouong saw evidence of this. W hue the
Reverend Bagley’s stomach was very round,
the bellies of his, Quong's, countrymen who
laid embraced the white mau s
flat, and their children were often stark
naked even in the depth of winter. All be-
cause of that seventh day.
Against the armor of Quong’s work-a-day
philosophy the Reverend Bagley s theologi-
cal arrows fell blunted, and lie would ui
doubtedly have had to w 7 rite him down as one
of his failures but for the direct interven-
tion of Providence, the Reverend Bagley
called it, sent to show the Chinaman the
error of his w 7 ays. Quong’s son, lus son and
sun, fell ill. He fell a victim to the worst
of all ills, leprosy. Quong was distracted.
Not that leprosy w r as in any way new to
him. He could see it any day in any street,
men with their ears gone, their fingers fallen
off, their toes rotting; but to see it in Ins
own son, the child w T ho would eventually be
a man and worship at his, Quong’s, grave,
was a different matter, and it drove him to
despair. Apart from the love he bore his son,
should he die what would happen when
Quong died and there w r as none left to wor-
ship at his grave? Of all the calamities
wdiicli could befall a man of Chino, that he
should have none to worship at his grave
was the worst. As he lay awake at night
Quong could, in imagination, see all the evil
spirits concentrating on his grave, while the
good spirits partook of the good things left
on and in the graves of those lucky enough
to leave behind sons who could worship them.
Long and earnestly, by day and by night,
Quong prayed for the cure of his son. r Lhe
money wdiicli might have been spent on a
doctor he expended on offerings to appease
the angry spirits. From sunrise to sunrise
joss-sticks, several at a time, smouldered
under the nose of his joss. To prove his
humility, he wmrked in his garden in the
depth of winter, naked save for a dirty clout
about his loins. But the spirits w 7 ere relent-
less. His sen grew worse. There were un-
doubted signs that the disease was spreading.
At his wits’ end and thoroughly frightened,
Quong, Quong the irreligious, called in all
humility on the Reverend Bagley.
But the Reverend Bagley was gone. Ener-
vated by the heat of the plains, weakened by
his labors, the reverend gentleman had built
himself a house in the hills, commended his
converts to the temporary keeping of Provi-
dence, and retired hence.
Quong returned home a broken man. The
god of the yellow man and the God of the
white had turned against him. Of all crea-
tures of wretchedness under the skies he was
most wretched. Already the thumb of his
son’s right hand had gone. And there were
open sores on his left. But one desperate
chance remained—so desperate that Quong
trembled at his own temerity in thinking
about it. It was well known that on the
top of Mount Mu Tung there lived a good
spirit who could cure leprosy. But also liv-
ing on the top of Mount Mu Tung were the
worst spirits in all China. It was common
knowledge that evil spirits lived at the top of
all mountains, but of all evil spirits on all
mountains those on top of Mu Tung were
the most vile. So vile were they that but
one man had ever spent a night at the summit,
and he had returned to the plain next morn-
ing a man in body with a goat's head on his
shoulders.
* * * *
Seated on the earthen floor in front of a
scanty fire, Quong's son was busy making a
kite. Because of the loss of the thumb of
his right hand he worked almost entirely
with his left, using his right only as a vice
in which to hold the kite. Watching the
slow, fumbling movements of the unaccus-
tomed little left hand, Quong for the first
time realised the value of a thumb. It sud-
denly dawned upon him that, deprived of
thumbs, this son of his would be little better
physically than the animals in the fields.
Enable to do for himself, what would befall
him when Quong was gone? And what of
those sores on his son’s left hand? The reali-
sation of what they meant frightened Quong.
His son probably would never understand the
meaning of the kiss his old father stopped
and solemnly bestowed upon his brow that
night. Later, when the boy was tossing rest-
lessly in his sleep, Quong gathered together
what remained in the house of rice, prayer
papers, and similar spirit-subduing parapher-
nalia, and when daylight came was well on
his way up the slopes of dreaded Mount Mu
Tung.
And that was how it came about that the
Rev. Arthur Bagley, on opening the door of
his hill retreat one morning, was surprised
to see some hundred yards away through the
trees a straw hut that had not been there the
previous night. It was a most miserable
straw hut, a mere shelter, wherein a dwarf
could not have stood upright, and into which
the rain trickled as through a sieve. But its
scant dimensions and rude structure were not
its only peculiarities. Ranged in a circle
of some twenty feet in diameter round the
hut were a number of poles with pieces of
string running from pole to pole. Depend-
ing from the strings were tiny bags of rice
and strips of red paper, and rice was strewn
on the rocks about the hut. Thus, deter-
mined to face the perils of the mountain, was
Quong fortifying himself against the evil
spirits by means of the red papers, and gain-
ing the favor of the good spirits through the
medium of the offerings of rice. For him-
self he had retained only a few grains of rice,
and faced the biting winds and driving rain
of the mountain-top clad only in a thin cotton
shirt. But what of that if he could save his
beloved son? If because of his sacrifice and
devotion the spirits would have compassion
and cure his boy, the hardships he endured
and the perils he ran counted not.
Stretched on his back in his miserable
shelter, drenched and shivering, Quong
awaited the will of the spirit when the
Reverend Bagley found him.
“To cure your son,” said the reverend
gentleman, when Quong had told his tale.
“Have you never heard of Him who cured
the leper merely by a touch of the hand?”
The story was a revelation to Quong. That

Old People’s
Kidneys
Many Elderly People Suffer
from Some Form of
Kidney Trouble
WHEN past middle age there frequently
comes a noticeable weakening of the
organs of the body, and resulting danger
of quick decline. It is quite necessary to give
prompt help to any part that first shows signs of
wear. Weak kidneys often bring constant back-
ache, lame back, stitches and twinges of pain,
annoying urinary troubles, and the danger of
serious kidney disease. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are gratefully recommended by many aged
people. Read these Sydney testimonies.
CONVINCING PROOF FROM
SYDNEY.
A MAN’S CASE
Mr. Frederick Bradd, Crump Street.
Mortdale, Sydney, says: “I caught a
severe cold, which settled in my kid-
neys and caused severe backache. I
suffered intense pain, and could not
stoop or move about freely. I did not
know what to do to get ease, for the
remedies 1 used did me no good. See-
ing an advertisement for Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills led me to try them.
They gave me relief right from the
first dose, and in a short time I was
cured. I have no sign of backache
now, and attribute my cure solely to
Doan's Backache Kidney Pills.”
Sixteen years later Mr. Bradd says :
“I have been free from backache since
Doan's Backache Kidney Pills cured
me sixteen years ago. 1 am still a
great believer in this medicine, and
often take a few doses, as I think the
kidneys need a tonic sometimes.”
A WOMAN’S CASE
Mrs. F. Osmond, No. 8 Gilbert
Street, Manly, Sydney, says: "I was
a martyr to backache, and the pain at
times was almost unbearable. I also
had several other distressing symptoms
of kidney disorder, such as headaches,
dizzy feelings and sleepless nights. I
was always trying one remedy or
another, but derived no benefit from
any of them. One day a friend urged
me to take a course of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and this medicine
proved to be the very thing I wanted.
There was a marked improvement after
taking the first bottle, and by the time
I had finished three bottles of the pills
I was quite cured, all sign of backache
having disappeared entirely."
Nine years later Mrs. Osmond says:
“I am still free of backache and kidney
trouble, and have been since Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured me over
nine years ago.”

SYDNEY MAN CURED OF PILES BY
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Mr. W. Solomon. Wentworth Street, Parramatta, Sydney, says: ‘About
20 years ago I had a very severe attack of Itching and Bleeding Tiles, and
underwent an operation. I was right for about eight years, and then the
complaint returned. The agony was terrible. Not wanting to undergo
another operation, I started using Pile remedies. The number I used would
astonish you, but they gave me no benefit whatever. I read of Doan s
Ointment "curing others, and decided to give it a trial. After a few applica-
tions I obtained relief and one pot cured me. I always keep Doan’s Ointment
in the house, and shall never be without it, for I know what a thoroughly
good remedy it is.”
Ten years later Mr. Solomon says; “I have still the same good opinion
of Doan’s Ointment. It cured me of Piles many years ago, and I never
suffer with this complaint now.”

such a thing could be passed all understand-
ing. Why, oh why, had he not before learned
the wonders of this white man's God? \\ hy
had he not listened when this God’s emissary,
the Rev. Arthur Bagley, had called to him
in his darkness? But for the evil course ol
his father, his sou probably would now be
well and strong.
Highly wrought, ready to grasp at any
straw of hope for his son’s deliverance,
Quong had listened, open-mouthed, to the
Reverend Bagley’s story.
“Can He cure my son?” he asked when
the man of God had finished.
“Most assuredly He can, if you shun that
rubbish and listen to Ilis word,” said the
preacher, indicating with a sweep _of liis
hands all that had stood for Quong’s faith
for forty years.
Stretching out again on his ragged mat,
Quong ignored the Reverend Bagley’s pres-
ence. But when morning came all sign of
the ritual of his fathers had vanished, and
Quong sat on the Reverend Bagley’s door-
step, ready to hear further of the magic
Name.
Quong’s belief in his new-found faith was
a beautiful thing. Cassocked monk was
never more devoted than he. Morning, noon
and night he knelt at the family prayers, and
often the Reverend Bagley found him, his
head inside his miserable straw shelter and
his feet out in the rain, offering up additional
prayers on his own account. His surrender
to his new God was supreme. Always there
was a smile upon his face, which neither the
bitterest of weather nor the rheumatism
which cruelly racked his joints could remove.
If while listening to the words of the new
God he kept an eye out for chance evil
spirits connected with the old, the rigorous
discipline of a lifetime must account for it.
Even a saint would find it difficult to entirely
forget a man with a goat’s head on his
shoulders.
But as man cannot live by bread alone,
neither could Quong rest for ever content
with the mere word. A sign was wanted to
show that this new God was a Reality and
not a mere Name. And so far there had
been no sign.
“What of my son?” Quong asked one day
when the family prayers were ended.
“Go down to the plain and fetch your
son,” was the answer. “We will pray for
and tend him here. And get yourself a pair
of trousers at the mission.”
Quong went down the mountain-side sing-
ing. The leaden weight of doubt which had
slowed liis steps on the journey up was en-
tirely missing. Before the day was out he
would see his son again, and hear from his
own lips of the wonder which had come upon
him. It was almost too great to believe.
What a god to worship was this God who,
by a mere touch of the hand, could deliver
his son from leprosy ! Truly what a God!
Quong continued his song.
Children, mostly naked and unashamed,
played in the dust of the road as Quong
entered the village. Up the narrow street
a sugar-cane seller shouted his wares in a
voice pitched a tone higher than that of the
hawker of live fish across the way. Barrow-
men, chanting a continual singsong to clear a
passage, wended their way through the jost-
ling throng of pedestrians. Rich merchants,
attired in gaudy silks and satins, rubbed
shoulders with strings of beggars impu-
dently plying their brazen trade in the street.
On every hand were signs of joy and glad-
ness. For to-morrow would be held the
festival of Bure Brightness, when the servant
was as good as the master, and even the fes-
tering beggar attained the dignity of a
man.
Threading his way through the crowd,
Quong continued to chant liis song. It
vaguely crossed his mind that it was fitting
the people should rejoice on such a day. But
their gladness could not be as the gladness of
Quong. One short day and their rejoicings
would give way before the primal call to
labor, whereas Quong’s happiness would go
on for ever. With his son strong again in
mind and body, gladness would be his portion
for the remainder of his days. And even
after death he would be happy with such a
son to worship at his grave.
At a point in the road the crowd split into
two streams, as a mob of sheep will divide
at an obstacle in the path. Moving with the
crowd and lost in peaceful contemplation,
Quong's first intimation of the box lying
in the middle of the road was the guffaws of
the crowd as he tripped and sprawled over it.
It was a very ordinary pine box, already
falling to pieces. The fact that it contained
a human corpse was not sufficiently striking
to hold the crowd in a land where the dead
are often cast into the middle of the road-
way, to await the kindly ministrations of an
obliging stranger, or the unkind attention of
wandering scavenger dogs. Too profoundly
happy to feel annoyed, Quong arose from
the dust and was about to pass on when a
hand protruding from the side of the box
caught his attention. As a man can live
through a lifetime in the instant of a dream,
so in an instant Quong saw that it was a
child’s hand, a child’s right hand, from which
the tiny thumb was missing. In the same
instant his heart stood still, the laughing,
jostling crowd faded from his cognisance,
and he was on his knees, frantically tearing
at the top boards of the box.
From violent action Quong lapsed into
inertia. With his arm flung across the open
box to support his weight, he sat staring at
the dead face of his son, the bitterness and
delusion of life tearing his old soul to shreds.
Surely death could not have done this thing
to him. leaving such a. plentitude of life on
every hand? With- so many homes teeming
with life, surely death had not chosen his
humble abode upon which to leave its scar?
Could this mute little figure under his gaze
be his son. and dead, after the promises of the
white man’s God made on the . top of Mount
Mu Tung? If so. what ; of. the leper cured
by a touch of the Hand? And what of
the word of the Rev. Arthur Bagley?
Until long after the last reveller had left
the street Quong sat motionless beside his
dead. But with the dawning of the festival
of Pure Brightness both had gone. And
while the Reverend Bagley waited and won-
dered on top of frowninjg Mount Mu Tong,
Quong had set out on the long journey
which .would settle- once andi for all the
omnipotence of the rival gods.
G. L. THOMAS.
Pensioned.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f tail of the long queue of old-age pen-
sioners was being steadily saturated
with rain. Accommodation in the
post-office paying-room was limited, and the
eaves afforded but scanty shelter to these
outsiders. Most of them were inadequately
clothed, but none complained. The very set
of the bent backs suggested patience, deepen-
ing into apathy. Subconsciously, perhaps,
these listless old folk registered this chilly
wait in the rain as a fitting accompaniment
to their Government dole, and their dim eyes
showed no gleam of rebellion.
Presently a little old woman joined the
queue. Clad in shabby black, she might well
have melted tonelessly into the general gloom
of the assembly as merely another touch to
the aggregated dark mass. Instead, she stood
out sharply as an individual. Even a casual
observer must have noted that all the repres-
sions of poverty had but banked up the fires
in these smouldering eyes. A Rembrandt,
limning the toothless face, wrinkled by time
and rheumatism into a myriad creases, would
have captured an elusive inner luminous-
ness which gave to it an undeniable beauty
and dignity.
This was the first time Mrs. Malione had
joined the band of pensioners. For the past
two days she had lived on bread and black
tea and slept on bare boards. She smiled as
she thought of what this new money would
buy for her. Thirty-five shillings a fort-
night ! She need starve no longer. No
longer need she force her swollen and aching
hands to do a long day’s washing and clean-
ing. But soon her thoughts drifted back to
the past, and her smile faded. Paddy would
turn in his grave if he knew she had come
to charity! Big Paddy Malione had adored
tin 1 rosy little wife he had brought out from
Ireland; but, alas; he had been bewitched
by the horses and consumed by the fever to
own a racer, and, dying young, had left her
penniless. Their two sons.. . .Mrs. Mahone's
face hardened as she thought of how, after
their father's death, they had drifted to jobs
with racing trainers. At first she had tried
to support herself and little Mollie by keep-
ing boarders, but the venture was a failure.
Unable to face her friends’ pity, she had then
migrated to Sydney, and gone into the only
avenue of employment she could find. As
charwoman she had earned a living and con-
trived to pay for Mollie’s education as a
typiste.
At the thought the old face became very
tender. Little Mollie —-a seven-months baby,
always needing special care. Mrs. Malione
recalled how she had cleansed the wee body
in oil for weeks, until it grew robust enough
to be bathed with water. Well, she had
done what she could to keep the howl of the
want-wolf from Mollie’s ears. True, she had to
work just as hard after Mollie secured a
position as typiste, for she had insisted on
Mollie spending all her money on herself, and
Mollie loved pretty things—and no wonder,
either, when she became them so well! And
Mollie was so clever. She began to accumu-
late pretty things so rapidly. She remem-
bered how aghast she felt at Mollie,"s first
pair of Milanese stockings—until Mollie ex-
plained that she bad made them in her spare
time at the office out of a remnant of silk.
And those beautiful furs! Mollie had told
her that a girl friend who worked in a fur
factory had got the skins at cost, and made
them up for her.
Then, suddenly, Mollie had left her. She
had been offered a better position in a branch
of the firm at Newcastle, and her mother
agreed to her going because it was clear to
her that Mollie would be better off away from
her. She would have a chance to make nice
friends if she could get to a place where she
was not obligedi,to disclose her mother's occu-
pation. But after Mollie left life had lost
its savor, and she had drifted miserably down
hill. But she had learned to seek a tem-
porary salve for her loneliness in wine bars
—though she never went inside one on those
rare days when Mollie wrote to her, address-
ing her letter to the post office where now she
stood.
Mrs. Malione suddenly became aware that
her thin sateen blouse was wet through.
The queue had melted, and she was alone in
the rain. Shivering, she went'in to the post
office and received her pension. As she
came out she, looked at the hotel opposite
where a red placard flamed : ‘‘Delicious hot
rum and coffee.” Ah, that was what she
wanted! She would have a cup—and a
bottle of gin to take home to'’ her little back
room over the greengrocer's shop. But first
she would see if there was a letter from
Mollie. She came out from the main room
of the post office with the letter in her hand
and crossed out of the wet on to the hotel
pavement. Then she opened the letter.
“Dear Mother,” wrote Mollie, “I haven’t
written for a long time because I’ve been
sick —only came out of hospital last week.
I’m still at this address, but will have to
clear out soon, as I’m broke. I was going
to get married, but I’m sick of the fellow I
was going out with. I’m sick of this place,
too. I’d like to get back to Sydney and see
a bit of real life. This place is dead slow, but
I haven’t the fare, so will have to find an-
other job here.”
Mrs. Malione looked up from the letter,
and her eyes rested on the red advertisement
for rum and coffee. But this time it con-
veyed no meaning to her brain. She re-
crossed to the post office and wrote out a
wire to Mollie. “Wiring you thirty shillings.
Come home at once. Fond love. —Mother.”

Whatever Happens
in regard to welfare take it calmly.
Whether you come into a FORTUNE, win the
CALCUTTA SWEEP, or walk off with the
BEAUTY PRIZE, keep a level head.
Whether you have sunk GOOD MONEY in BAD
MARKS, in a COLOSSAL SWINDLE or get away
with the BOOBY PRIZE, don’t be downhearted.
Whatever happens in regard to health always demands
early and careful consideration.
Without good health good fortune loses half its value ;
depression is doubled when bad luck is encountered.
Well! there is nothing more suitable than Beecham’s
Pills when you are out of sorts, liverish, languid and
depressed, when appetite is fickle, digestion upset,
and the system requires purifying and toning up.
Why ! the universal popularity and enormous sale of
this specific is alone convincing testimony to its
genuine worth.
