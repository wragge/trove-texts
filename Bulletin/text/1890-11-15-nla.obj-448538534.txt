SUFFERING FROM
BRAIN & NERVE EXHAUSTION.
Any man who in his youth has trifled away his vigour
of body mind, and manhood, should consult 1 KO-
FESSOK CAIUi STINEWAY, the Eminent Spcei d.ct
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is still
treating with the greatest skill and success all 1 mate,
•Nervous, and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINEWAY’S great success, which has
become so linnly established throughout Austral om,
is based upon the facts : - Ist. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines and Electuc
Appliances used are exactly adapted to suit the case,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I SEEK CASES WHERE ALL ELSE HAS FAILED.
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, lie., can
recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in / ersen or by letter, which is free),
Professor CARL STINEWAY, who has restored
thousands of sufferers to vigorous manhood
after all other treatment had failed. It makes
no difference what you have taken, or who has
failed to cure you. Cases that I accept for treat-
ment are quickly and permanently cured,
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION :-Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease ? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the pow a;of will and action? Are
you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of faint-
ing ; fullness of blood n the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy ? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful, with your mind continually dwelling
on the subject? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation of
the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the bead, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single
consultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed
on the way to health strength, and vigour ?

THE WAY TO WEALTH.
The way to wealth is as plain as the way to market.
The majority of the wealthy men of Sydney, Melbourne
and Brisbane made their money by buying land in these
capital cities while it was low in price, and before these
cities were so large and populous "as at present.
'Western. Australia
is the coming colony. Her Capital City will become
a second Melbourne or Sydney.
If you want to make money, buy land
there now. It is a good spec.

DISEASES
OF THE
EYE, EAR. NOSE.
THROAT &c
Diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat
of a difficult and complicated character have
been cured by
Dr. G. H. RAYMOND,
The Eminent
Botanic Physician, Specialist & Medical Writer,
Even after the leading specialists and general physicians
and surgeons of England and the Colonies had experi-
mented in vain. A pamphlet of testimonials', opinion’s of
the press, and elaborate dissertations will be sent on
receipt of a penny stamp. Works acknowledged by the
Princess of Wales. Address
62 Wynyard-Square, Sydney-
A few opinions of the Queensland Newspapers concern-
ing Dr. RAYMOND'S skill and Treatment:
“ This gentleman, after a stay of some four months in
Blackall, has returned to Clermont, where, on a prior
visit, he performed some clever auricular and ocular cures.
During Dr. Raymond's stay in Blackall he has performed
several srrand cures, especially with the eye, and we wish
him success wherever he goes. In eye complaints the
Professor is perfectly at home; his treatment is simple,
decisive, effectual and lasting.”— Western Champion,
Blackall, Queensland, 1885.
“ VVe can vouch for a number of his cures, as the
patients have presented themselves several times to us for
inspection, and we believe that they are very lucky to be
able to see at all. The Professor is certainly a wonderful
man.”— Norman Chronicle, Northern Queensland, 1885.
“ From personal knowledge, as well as abundant testi-
mony, we are in a position to state that Professor Ray-
mond has effected some marvellous cures.”— Hugiikndon
Ensign, North-Western Queensland, 18S5.
“We have seen several testimonials to Professor Ray-
mond's skill from well-known people in the town and dis-
trict.”— Daily Bulletin, Townsville.
“ His many permanent cures of very difficult, and in
some instances almost hopeless cases, have been very
favourably commented on by the whole press, both in the
southern and northern portions •»* the colony.”- Cook-
town Courier, 1885.

Botany, may now be CONSULTED at 62 WYNYARD-

SWORN CERTIFICATE.—One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 188 S.
To H. F. Kuof.lmann, Esq.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. / consulted
more than vi.e doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the sli'htest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
/ became a perfect skeleton. About Feb uary last T began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity tf bad matter I
was expectcrating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you coukl cure me for a given. sum. 1 agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fes-ional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

“ You have given me life and living
Colonel Mapleson writes as follows:—‘‘Madame Roze
recognises in your preparation the precious Saline that
she found so invaluable when she visited New Orleans
during the last yellow fever epidemic, in order, by her
concerts, to raise funds for the benefit of the stricken
ones, who could not afford the necessary comforts, and
which the crowded hospitals were unable to supply to
thousands of applicants. Madame Roze was advised by
Dr. Barnes, of London, to take your Saline with her, and
we took several dozen bottles. I really believe it saved
our lives.”

Acting on the Liver, Bowels and Kidneys imperceptibly

Its utility as a remedy in fevers, and as a cooling drink

The extraordinary reputation of Rowland a Macassar

the principle on which each is prepared is confined

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1890.
The Frugality Fraud.
Ix has long been the habit of the apologists
for the flagrant inequalities of fortune,
which make existence a purgatory for the
majority of human beings, to add insult to
the injuries under which the poor sutler,
health, it is asserted by these complacent
theorists, is simply the fruits of frugality
and self-denial. The wretchedly poor are
thus habitually taunted. It is their own
fault, they are told, that they are not rich.
Dives, emerging from his bath of asses’
milk, to seat himself at table and toy list-
lessly with dainty morsels, complacently rallies
Lazarus and charges him with abominable
habits of self-indulgence and profusion. The
modern capitalist of the self-made class
points to his own exploits. He began life
with a borrowed sixpence. He worked early
and late. He denied himself tobacco and
beer, fresh-air trips, entertainments, and
books. He crushed down his inclination
for the modest maiden whose shy glances
bespoke her willingness to be wooed and wed.
And now, he exclaims, look at the result.
In 20 years he has “ made ” a fortune of a
hundred thousand pounds. At seven-and-
thirty he married a young lady—daughter of
a gentleman whose boots he" once cleaned.
“Behold, he cries, “what can be accom-
plished by frugality and self-denial.” The
young woman whom he did not marry is
now Mrs. Lazarus, mother of seven. She
has lost her good looks, her fine figure, and
her sweet temper. She is careworn, shrill,
and dowdy. And Lazarus,' who worked at
the same bench with Dives, the self-made
man, is working at that bench still, and
owes £3 11s. 7d. to the storekeeper and
larger or smaller bills to all the other trades-
people.
* * #
The entire assumption which underlies
and seems to justify this taunting of the poor
by the rich is honeycombed with fallacies.
In the first place, although the poor man may
not have exerted any extraordinary severity
of self-denial, it does not follow that he has
been guilty of blameable self-indulgence or
of culpable profusion. I t must be admitted,
certainly, that there may be profligate ex-
penditure even when a man’s income is but
a pound per week. The pound may be
spent on follies, while for necessaries, debt
may be incurred. But the average man
plods along in an equable middle course.
He cuts his coat according to his cloth, and
while submitting to that existence of habitual
and unintermittent restraint which the ordi-
nary earnings of exertion for wage, or the
course of petty trade, imposes, lie endeavours
to extract as much present comfort and
indulgence as his narrow means will permit.
The ordinary man is, of course, incapable of
extraordinary management. The fellow who,
commencing at the bottom of the ladder’
climbs to the top is an extraordinary man.
But let him not rub his hands and
chuckle over this admission until vve
have finished the argument. In the
second place, although self-denial and
frugality may give many a man the start
on his way to wealth, these qualities alone
never yet enabled any man to acquire a great
fortune. A man may found his fortune on
what he saves, but he must build it of
different material, else the pile will be but a
mean one after all. No man ever yet saved
a great fortune out of an honest salary. No
man ever yet earned a great fortune. Every
great fortune is derived from plunder, in
some fashion, direct or indirect, for even a
great salary is an indirect fashion of plunder-
ing whoever provides it.
* * #
Again, the taunt, reproaching each poor
man with opportunities wasted, is, of
necessity, levelled not only at each, but at
all. It involves the presumption that every
man might, were he to make the necessary
effort, achieve wealth. . This is the fallacy
most easily exposed, because it permits of
mathematical reprobation. For example,
the total private income of the inhabitants
of the United Kingdom is estimated at
1247 millions of pounds sterling. This is a
gigantic sum. But when equally apportioned
among the population it amounts only to
£35 per head per annum. Applied to the
colony of New South Wales, the same test
shows that the total wealth annually pro-
duced yields to the people but £57 per head
of annual income. Nothing can be clearer
than that no conceivable increase of personal
exertion could double that annual income,
considering that it is calculated as appor-
tioned among babies in arms, women,
children, lunatics, and criminals, as well as
among actual workers.
* * #
And even were it doubted, it would still
be very far short of what is understood by
wealth to each family group, or to each in-
dividual. As society is organised, the few
only can be very wealthy, and their riches
must be accumulated by the deprivation of
the many. That is to say, in order to allow
for the incomes of the wealthy classes
in Great Britain and in Australasia,
heavy reduction must be made in the
average incomes of the residue of the popu-
lation. So that if one million of the
fortunate in Great Britain have among them
incomes equal to £lOOO per annum each,
there would remain for the rest of the
population but 247 millions sterling.
* # #
It is plain, therefore, that the pretence
that the accumulation of capital is primarily
due to the exercise of frugality and self-
denial will not stand examination. If all
men were frugal and self-denying—as in
reality all men are, of necessity, except the
rich—only those would become rich who
carried these qualities to extremes, or who
wrought by quite other means. This is
precisely the actual case. It is not the
merely frugal man, or the modestly self-
denying man, who is able to achieve wealth.
So far as these dispositions assist at all, it is
in an intense form, wherein they not
merely cease to be virtues, but trench
upon the domain of actual vice. Frugality
has to pass into parsimony and self-
denial to stiffen into callous insensibility
before they can be serviceable. Those only,
in fact, can ever hope to succeed in the com-
petition for wealth who are imbued with the
insensate spirit of the desperate gambler.
Their frugality and their self-denial are not
practised as virtues, since they are only
undertaken, as a rule, for the purpose
of enabling them to enjoy, after a
period of self-denial, without restraint
the fullest scope of lavishness and of
self-indulgence. It frequently happens, how-
ever, that the object aimed at is never
attained. Frugality carried to the extremity
of penuriousness, and self-denial aggravated
to asceticism, become indurated in the dis-
position of the wealth-seeker. Instead of
the servants and ministers of his will, they
become masters, and when the necessity for
their employment has long passed 'they
dominate the man who engaged them, just
as accomplices in a crime undertaken for
money getting render the life of their prin-
cipal a burden to him after he has possessed
himself of the prize for which he sacrificed
his innocence.
* # #
The man who determines to deny himself
every indulgence in order that later he may,
by the acquisition of wealth, grant himself
every pleasure, stakes his life against the
chances. If he die before he achieve wealth,
he will have lost all. He is simply a des-
perate gamester, “plunging” on a big coup.
If he lose, he is lost sight of. If he win, he
puts on frills and takes upon himself to lec-
ture everyone who declined the desperate
hazard, while propounding to them the ridi-
culous proposition that there was a prize for
every ad venturer. It is unhappily but too true
that the competition in penuriousness, with
the acquisition of wealth in view, is'but too
general. I here is no lack among the poor
Ojf that frugality and self-denial which the
rich claim as the exclusive virtue of their
class, and as the source and cause of Capital.
Ihe fact is that there are so many frugal,
that other qualities have to come into opera-
tion to sort out the winners, and to accom-
plish the survival of the fittest. To be
frugal and self-denying demands of a man
neither virtues nor abilities. The meanest
wretch on earth has a better chance in the
trial of frugality than either a generous or a
commonplace-natured man. A noble nature
could compete in respect of self-denial,
where the object is worthy of the effort.
But at the next stage —denial of help to
misfortune the noble nature would be
worsted by the ignoble one. The generous
man’s purse, which remained full while only
limitation of his own cravings was involved
in thus keeping it, would become empty
directly when distressed virtue tugged at
the strings. In the further tests of the
competition, the finer nature would con-
stantly find itself at a disadvantage. It
would shrink from shabby gains, and recoil
from profitable chicaneries. 1 1 would be
occupied with higher thoughts, while the
sordid intellect revolved schemes of plunder
and advantage. The pursuit of gain alone is
not an elevating pursuit. Those who achieve
the object sometimes seem to have preserved
a capacity for enjoyment and a sentiment
of humanity. In such cases, the original
nature must have been exceptionally robust
in these qualities for any remnant of them
to have emerged from the ordeal ta which
they had been subjected. To harden one’s
heart for half one’s life-time and then to
thaw it out again is an adaptability not
granted to many.
& # #
The stern fact is that the achievement of
a great fortune is not an indication of the
possession of original virtuous tendencies
as many hireling penmen would have the
world believe. It is easier for a coarse
nature to accumulate wealth than it is for a
fine or a delicate one, and it probably always
has been. The delicate-minded man turns
disgusted from endless chances which the
coarse man gobbles with gusto. As Solo-
mon says, in the Proverbs, “ITe that
maketli haste to be rich, shall not be in-
nocent.” As Bacon says, (who styles riches
the impedimenta of virtue) “ The ways to
enrich are many, and most of them "foul.
Parsimony is one of the best, and yet is
not innocent, for it with-holdetli ruin from
works of liberality and charity.” Ten
thousand honest fellows strove in vain for
competence, where Charteris succeeded in
heaping up wealth —Charteris on whom
Swift, Pope, and Arbutiinot concerted the
famous epitaph commencing “ Here con-
tinues to rot” and of which four lines runs
thus :
“ Nor was he more singular
In the undeviating pravity of his manners
Than successful
In accumulating wealth.”
* * #
But it is scarcely necessary to go back so
far for illustrations when instances throng
around us to-day. It is pretty hard for the
owner of a horse and dray to eke out a
living carting bricks. Let him start as night-
man, and lie is on the road to fortune,
especially if he will steal things left about
in the convenient darkness. Tobacconists’
shops are over-numerous, and a new-comer
would probably find it no easy matter to pay
expenses. But throw in a totalisator in a
back-room and be not over-nice about buy-
ing plugs of tobacco from factory-hands, or
tram-tickets from guards, and there is money
in it. The medical profession is somewhat
overstocked in Australia, and a fair income
has to be struggled for. But let any vagrant
hang out a sign and advertise his skill" as a
curer of filthy diseases, and the fees roll in
apace. One blackguard has made £lOO,OOO
by that profession in Sydney already, and now
qualified physicians are tumbling over one
another to succeed to his practice. Landlords
and brewers have so bedevilled every licensed
public-house that no man can sell honest
liquor and pay his way, except in a few well-
connected establishments. But there is still
money in the business with the help of an
illicit still and a bevy of back-parlour hussies.
Nothing is more difficult than for a lady,
however gifted with business tact and
organising faculty, to make money in busi-
ness. Yet there is a sure fortune for any such
who will simply furnish and conduct a brothel.
In fine, the clean ways of money-making are
overflowed with competition to such an
extent that there are no profits left in them.
“ Root hog, or die ” has become a condition
of existence. But it is unbearable that the
hogs should find scullions to vaunt them as
the only sweet, cleanly animals, and that
there should be writers to prate revolting
trash about capital being the reward of
frugality, and as having, under the name of
Property, rights which are “sacred.”
Too Much Government.
Sir Samuel Griffith’s latest project for the
extension of the system of local government in
Queensland, by converting that province into a
federation of three autonomous states, is in
some respects a genuine measure of reform, but
it promises to bring about a state of things under
which a country that is already governed
quite enough will in future be governed a great
deal too much. The existing system by which
the entire administration is centred in the
dismal, unkempt city of Brisbane, situate at the
remote south-eastern corner of the territory, is
admitedly a failure, but the remedy is alto-
gether 100 large for the disease. The typical
Liberal " Ministry was undoubtedly an evil.
It was recruited from the merchants and
auctioneers and land-boom fiends of Queen -
street, and it had a parochial soul and ideas
that seldom ranged beyond the narrow limits of
commissions and percentages. It viewed the
great mining industry of the north as a thing
specially created by Providence in order that
the southern political! might get up profitable
syndicates and rig the share-market, and it
looked upon the broad lands of the interior
merely as material for auction-sales ; but apart
from its own petty interests everything outside
Brisbane was a blank, and Brisbane itself was
the centre of the earth. The old “Liberal”
minister knew nothing beyond the capital and
in it he knew so little that he did not’ even
know how little he did know. His one idea of
progress was to promote the expansion of his
dreary, dusty town, until at last Queensland
should be reduced to the unnatural condition of
New South Wales or Victoria, where nearly
half the population is centred in one city that
lives, like a vampire, on the life-blood of the
country at large ; and but for the incipient
revolt of the North and the chronic disaffection
of the central districts this policy of centralisa
tion would doubtless have prospered, and paid
large dividends to its supporters. "
'* * %
It is a specimen of the irony of fate that Sir
Samuel Griffith —himself the inventor of the
“Queen-street Ministry’’—should have com
pounded the huge and elaborate panacea that is
to remedy the evil which he did more than anv
other politician to bring about. Queensland
under the new regime is to be no longer a colonv
but a confederation of three colonies. Ther
are to be three separate Legislatures for
northern, central, and southern Queensland
respectively, and a Federal Legislature at Bris-
bane ; and there are to be three Lieutenant-
Governors elected by the people, and a Federal
or boss Governor in the capital, who will repre-
sent the majesty of Britain as heretofore. 1 g 0
far the scheme is excellent, and with the single
exception of the vice-regal encumbrance who is
to prop up the dignity of the British Crown it
presents no single feature to which a demo-
cracy can take objection, and even he is possibly
only admitted into the programme as a tem-
porary and unavoidable evil, to be got rid of at
the earliest convenient opportunity. The
election of the provincial Governors by the
people is in itself a serious blow at nominee-
ism, and the very existence of such a
semi-republican institution will pave the way
sooner or later for the abolition of the
whole race of imported viceroys. Then, when
the Federation of Australia is accomplished the
Brisbane Legislature and the Brisbane viceroy
are to be merged in the new central authority •
the three sub-divisions of the colony will rank
as individual members of the Australian com-
monwealth ; and their democratic institutions
may then serve as a precedent for those other
States which still hunger after imported
Governors, and want to keep up in each separate
capital a shadow of vice-regal State for the
publican to grovel to and the fatted pawnbroker
to adore. It will be sufficient misfortune if the
new Federation begins its career with an im-
ported Governor-General as the figurehead of
the State; to have in addition an imported
deputy in each provincial capital would be too
great a calamity for popular endurance.
* * #
But, unfortunately, Sir Samuel Griffith’s
scheme is hampered by ruinous defects. Eng-
land has set the example of government by two
Legislative Chambers, one being appointed to
do the actual work of the State, while it is the
business of the other as a dead weight to
hamper and retard its movements, and the Aus-
tralian politician can no more realise the
possibility of departing from this ancient pre-
cedent than he can imagine the possibility of a
world in which dimensions have been abolished
and length, breadth, and thickness are no
longer existent. Therefore each separate Par-
liament is to be cumbered with an Upper
House, making eight separate chambers in all
to legislate for a population of some 400,000
souls, and the new system promises to break
down at the outset beneath the weight of its
own pomp and majesty. A country where
everybody is a duke is certain, sooner or later,
to come to grief, and a very small nation with
eight distinct Senates is in almost as bad a
situation. But this mode of government is part
of that great system which England com-
pounded through force of necessity out of the
chaos of despotism and mediaeval ignorance,
and because she could get nothing better in the
dark ages therefore the infant states of Aus-
tralia must take the whole cumbersome dignity
or none at all. Great Britain, with some
35,000,000 inhabitants, is able to stagger along
under the load, and therefore North Queens-
land, with the population of a fourth-rate pro-
vincial city, must needs carry tlje same burden,
or as much of it as she can endure. The scheme
is as grotesque as that of attaching an Upper
House to a suburban Municipal Council, or
tacking on a hereditary Chamber of Peers to a
Church Synod, but Premier Griffith’s remote
ancestors did this sort of thing, and precedent
forbids him to be more intelligent than his
forefathers.
* * *
In the empty states of North and Central
Queensland a provincial Government is pre-
sumably a matter of utility—not one of orna-
ment. And this being the case, they might
conveniently start with a Legislature of 20 or
30 plain citizens who would be paid for their
services at the rate of half-a-guinea per sitting,
with an additional allowance for expenses in
the case of country members—the salary to
be paid only 7 to such representatives as are
actually present. The offices of State could be
supplied by 7 a Cabinet of three or, at most, four
Ministers elected for a fixed period by the
House, at a salary of T4OO each per annum.
Such a system would no doubt destroy the
perennial joys and excitement of a Ministerial
crisis, but a crisis at the best is an expensive
luxury, and the little communities of tropical
Queensland would do well to confine themselves,
in the early years of their political existence, to
mere necessaries. Also, a cheap and durable
Governor with an umbrella a plain native
potentate elected by universal suffrage, sound
m wind and limb and already acclimatised—
would be found at least as serviceable as the
gilded person who generally fills the vice-regal
office ; and having appointed this individual, it
would be well for 1 iis constituents to impress
upon him that he was intended for business,
and not merely for exhibition purposes Con-
sequently, if lie desired to make a triumphal
progress through the country with the object of
opening bridges, and inaugurating bazaars, and
turning the first sod of some new railway, he
should be allowed to do so entirely at his own
expense. The average bridge gets on as just well


' 'thoiit any official opening, and the first sod of
'new railway can be turned to quite as good
-nose by an ordinary navvy with a shovel ;
P l y., u fi( . o nomy is an essential part of the policy
new state, these functions might reasonably
f licensed with. Also, if the finances would
bed to the expense, it might be advisable to
nurchase an iron safe as a receptacle for Acts of
Parliament, and if this article proved to lie
l vond the reach of the Treasury, the Acts might
deposited in the bank for safe keeping, and
duplicate copies might be provided and stowed
a P i u a box under the Premier s bed. And
when a house had been rented for the
Governor’s accommodation, and another for the
0 f the Legislature, the prospects of the
State would be all that any patriot could
desire. # # #
No doubt politics under these bald and
strictly utilitarian conditions would lose many
nf their attractions, yet Government, like every
other industry, must be judged by results and
the mace, and the sergeant-at-arms, and the
other ornaments and decorations of Parliament
are 110 essential part of the science of states-
manship. But if there are to be four full-
blown cabinets each with an expensive Premier,
and a Treasurer and a Colonial Secretary, and a
Minister for Works, and a Minister for Mines,
a live Postmaster-General ; and four
e rown-up Ministerial Parties, and four rampant
Oppositions, and four Houses of Peers, and
each separate colony is to have the customary
allowance of colonels and major-generals, and
fortifications, and autumn manoeuvres, and sub-
departments, then the population cannot possi-
bly stand so large a quantity of government,
and the new system must founder beneath the load
of its own overwhelming dignity. The scheme
is in its purpose, the most democratic and
the most patriotic which has yet been originated
by any administration of which Sir Samnm
Griffiths was a member, and if carried out on
any practicable basis it will do much to prepare
the way for the establishment of the future Re-
public of Australia. The election of Lieutenant-
Governors by the people will lead to the
appointment of elective Governors in place of
the old brand of imported viceroy, and then the
invisible “ bond ” which unites Australia to
England will be worn very thin, and the elective
Governor will speedily give place to the Presi-
dent of the Australian Commonwealth. But the
result cannot be brought about by using a two-
quart reform to extinguish a one-pint grievance.
The remedy might be a good one if applied to a
larger patient, but it is impossible to mobilise
one man satisfactorily, or to form a solitary full
private into a hollow square that will be of any
general utility, and the project of constructing
eight legislative chambers and four governors out
of a population which would barely furnish one
second-class city involves too great a strain on
the resources of the country. Moreover, a
statesman is supposed by a Parliamentary
fiction to be a man of wisdom, or at least of
moderate intelligence, and if there is the raw
material of twelve statesmen in Queensland,
then the country has more brains in proportion
to population than any other place upon this
earth.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Extinct Race.
One of the saddest little episodes that ever
shone in print is the tale of that pious demon-
stration against gambling and carnal dissipation
with which the Church hails each successive
Melbourne Cup. There are a few lectures, and
a few speeches, and sad, weary, blighted
picnics or other outdoor entertainments, which
are vaguely described as a “counter-attraction,
and intended to over-balance the riotous car-
nival of the world, the flesh, and the devil.
These distressing performances are attended by
some few dozen elderly spinsters—lank and
harmless maidens who are all bones and gusli
and front teeth, and a few dozen youths who
were born old and speckled, and who are much
afflicted with groans and cold feet and porous
plasters, and similar spiritual indulgences.
And the natural result of this proceeding is that
the Church makes an ass of itself as usual, and
its efforts are as useless as if it threw mud at
the stars, or fired its little brick at the rising
sun. There is an incurable idiocy about the
apostle of the nineteenth century, and the one
thing which he is utterly unable to realise is
the sense of his own smallness and insigni-
ficance, and the one mystery which passes his
comprehension is the decline and hopeless
collapse of the faith which the world once place< l
in him. Centuries ago the Church was
almost omnipotent to-day it is only a
ruin. But then the parson of these old
days used to whale himself in the streets, or to
get himself whaled by some enthusiastic
brother, by way of demonstrating his sense of
his own sinfuiness, and whatever the public
thought of his intelligence it had to recognise
the fact that he was prepared to bet on his
opinion that he was a miserable transgressor.
Also, he hung out as a hermit in waste places,
and expressed his faith by dragging himself
through brambles, and rolling on nettles and
cactus-plants, and when he preached that the
world was naught his audience generally be-
lieved his words, for his own battered condition
was a sufficient evidence of good faith. Even
when he wanted to betake himself to pious
meditation lie often did it by sitting upon
sharp spikes or walking on unboiled peas or
assuming other uncomfortable attitudes, and
though the apostle of those days tvas a stupen-
dous lunatic lie commanded respect, because, in
his own plain, deranged fashion, he endeavoured
to act up to his disjointed creed, and he mani-
fested his belief in Heaven by making for him-
self incessantly a little hell upon earth. But
the teacher with an immense dinner and a bank
account is out of place when promulgating a
doctrine of self-sacrifice, and his theory that the
times havcohanged and that he must change with
the times is only a feeble apology, for the creed
which he expounds is unchangeable, and the
law which bids him devote himself to the
service of mankind and trust to chance or
lTovidencc for his victuals holds good to-day
as it did nineteen hundred years ago. The
spectacle of a large, fat man discoursing on the
joys of poverty is not edifying —it is only dis-
gusting, and the same individual preaching a
gospel which commands him to keep only one
coat and give the other to the poor is an appro-
priate mark for the bricks and bad eggs of an
unchristian generation. And so the Church
dodders along in the last stage of idiocy and
decay, and gets up picnics for the tough and
sentimental maiden of 42 ; and except for an
occasional follower who is short in his cash,
and a believer who wallops his wife, and an
aged girl who has bestowed her withered soul
in secret upon the curate, its adherents are
practically an extinct race.
—.
The Dignity of the Church.
Tiieke is one point —and only one on which
the parson is always solid. Whenever any
weighty disaster comes down on the nation, he
invariably recognises it as a judgment sent
along by Providence, because an impious
generation doesn’t got to Church regularly, and
listen with due respect to the cataract of his
hogwash, as he wails and wobbles and flounders
about the way Israel went up the spout some
700 years B. C. Providence, in his opinion,
spends its whole time in discharging famine
and thunder at this globe to avenge the outrage
levelled at the throne of heaven through the
falling off in the Rev. Samuel Smith’s takings,
and it overturns empires in an attempt to get
square on account of a schism in a Sunday-
school, and the consequent withdrawal in dis-
gust of two old women and a little girl. The
Rev. W atkin, D.D., the principal light of the
Wesleyan Methodist persuasion, is evidently
an average parson of the customary type, and
in publishing his theories about the strike he
recognises, as the parson always does, that the
hand of God is blindly shoving along the great
cause of the collection, and doesn’t care though
it shakes the earth to do it: —
Was it not possible to discern the hand of God in the
great Strike that has been affecting the community?
Might it not be regarded as a sign of God's vengeance for
the desecration of the Lord’s day in a multitude of ways
by almost all classes amongst 11s? Perhaps God used
capital to smite labour and labour to smite capital, and
labour and capital to smite the public, and there was
need of national humiliation and national atonement If
we were to ward off such visitations we must learn to
keep God’s Sabbath and to reverence His sanctuaries.
The smallness of W atkin, D.D., and 10,000
parsons of his kind, shines out conspicuously in
this utterance. The vengeance of God, in his
view, doesn’t worry itself at all about the greed
and selfishness of Capital, or the ignorance of
Labour; it isn’t troubled about drunkenness
and vice, about land-boom swindles and horse-
swindles and mining swindles; about affluent
parsons who take a hand in shady speculations,
and pillars of the church who sneak after little
girls in dark lanes, and pious Sabbatarians who
clean out banks and building societies and reduce
their clients to beggary ; and takes no notice
of the fact that everybody is trying to take in
somebody else by snuffle or embezzlement, or
any other available means. But the same ven-
geance wakes up like two wild tigers and a
famished vulture to rend this globe on account
of Sunday trains, and the opening of libraries
on the day of rest, and the feckless disre-
gard of the plate. The vanity of the par-
son is an incurable disease. If a whole city
is overturned he is always of opinion that Pro-
vidence did it in order to blow a fly off the
head of a minister or a Sunday-school teacher,
and neither the law or the prophets will con-
vince him that the result was not worth the
sacrifice. He regards the earthquake as a
scheme for raising his screw, and the tornado as
a divine manifestation in favour of the repairs
of the church, and he looks on the volcano as
an advertisement. In short, he suffers from an
impression that he is the centre of the celestial
system, and that the sun and the planets and
the fixed stars all revolve round him, and the
only reason why the earth doesn’t tip up when
he steps on it is that there is another parson to
balance it at the other end.
-♦
The Revolt of Capital.
The latest reports from London foreshadow a
speedy re-opening of the great battle between
Capital and Labour which was fought with
so much determination some six months ago,
and consequently the day of that “permanent
agreement between employers and employed
which the capitalist professes himself so anxious
to bring about is likely to lie indefinitely post-
poned. The miserable concession of one penny
per hour which the starving dock-labourers
wrung from the Slave-owners of England is an
offence which has never been forgiven, and al-
ready there are signs that the autocratic
employers intend to provoke a new conflict, and
if possible starve their helots into unconditional
surrender. It is true that the dock-owners, by
a liberal revision of their scale of charges, not
only passed their entire loss on to the public
but largely added to their own revenues by the
transaction. Met the fact that the labourer
get s a small fraction of these new profits is an
offence to the dignity of property which nothing
but the utter destruction of trades-unionism can
wipe out. If the South Carolina planter had
been forced into temporary concession by his
own revolted “ nigger ” the insult could hardly
have been felt more deeply, and the formation
of a gigantic -Employers’ Union is_ a distinct
evidence of the resolve that the next industrial
struggle shall be a war of extermination in
which no quarter will be given. 1 lie agree-
ment entered into at the conclusion of the strike
lias already been repudiated' by the employers,
and at the Victoria Docks the first act of overt
hostility has been committed, as is evidenced by
the following cablegram ■
A strike has taken place at the Victoria Dock.
Under the new system of working, the half-hour pre-
viously conceded to the dock-labourers for their dinner,
and naid for by the docking companies, has been dis-
allowed, and the men are indignant at what they consider
an injustice.
Eight hundred of them have gone out on strike.
The fact that the wharf-labourer actually
wants a few minutes to consume his bread and
cheese, or, more probably, his bread without the
cheese, and his objection to work without a
moment’s intermission from daylight till dark,
like a beast of burden, is the outrage against
which the employer has risen in insurrection,
and supported as he is by the combined strength
of Capital he will probably carry his point. But
if he does his victory can only be definitely
achieved by the utter destruction of Unionism,
and if Unionism is destroyed by any other
means than its wholesale absorption by Socialism
the only resource that remains will be insurrec-
tion—or dynamite.
Melbourne Age is evidently in a state of
transition. In a leader devoted to the criticism
of Socialism appears the following drivel: —
Referring to the economic ethics of Messrs. Marx and
Bellamy, the institution of property in the form of ex-
clusive and permanent possession by an individual is
absolutely indispensable to the progress of a nation. This
is and can be the only incentive to make men give the
fullest use of their powers, and thereby increase to its
maximum the productivity of the industrial community.
Hence it follows that to discourage the alert from seizing
good opportunities on the wing by confiscating the results
of their owners and distributing them among the languid
and inactive would simply mean the checking of indi-
vidual industry and the crippling of the national pro-
duction.
That this is both morally and economically false
is immediately obvious to those who are conver-
sant with the writings of the authors cpioted,
but where the supreme audacity of the journal
in aspiring to lead public opinion comes in,
considering that it rushes into print with half-
formed notions and incoherent inconsistencies,
may conclusively be proved by perusing the
leader which appeared the next day hut one
following, expressing its views afresh in these
words:—
Individualism means the triumph of the competitive
principle, and this in turn implies the perpetual conflict
of private interests as against the interests of the com-
munity. The inference is plain. A community founded
on the conflict of private interests will never progress
beyond a certain point, namely, the point at which the
welfare of the many ceases to be the paramount considera-
tion and is made subservient to the interests of the indi-
vidual. Utopists may dream of an individualistic paradise
in which every man may do whatsoever seemeth best in
his own eyes, but the omens all point in the other
direction. Wherever individualism has had a temporary
reign it has always spelt anarchy.
After this there is yet some hope for the blatant
Argus.
The Law of Universal Existence.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
As infinite existence is subject to universal laws,
and as some of the other worlds doubtless teem
with life of a far more highly-developed nature
than the globe we now inhabit, and as the forma-
tion and decay of myriads of planetary systems
around us continues ceaselessly, man must dis-
cover the Law of Universal Existence before he
can account for his own creation or absolutely
define his duties and aims. According to the
orthodox idea, there originally existed one
primary principle; this was the principle of
intell ct, generally termed “God.” How this
Omnipotent Mind could exist by itself when mind,
except combined with matter, is inconceivable,
has never yet been explained. It would surely
not be rational to believe that mind (even were it
possible to exist independent of material assist-
ance) could create matter out of space. The
absurdity of attempting to explain our origin and
that of all infinity by such a dogma is so obvious
to any reflective person that further investigation
into the science of first principles is not only
desirable, but absolutely necessary. Hence the
following contribution towards unravelling the
skein of the Mystery of Nature.
# * #
There is an all - pervading and universal
principle of existence, and this is the Prin-
ciple of Motion, which is self existent and
essential. Without, some such activity as its
fountain-head, existence could not be other
than a universal vacuum. This principle of motion
has to express itself in some palpable form, and
this it does through the sign of matter. It is,
however, not uniformly operative throughout
existence, being more active in some parts than in
others. Uneven motion, however, constantly
endeavours to become uniform, and in its efforts
towards attaining that end its component and
various factors of velocity produce that conscious
form we term life. Mind without matter is im-
possible. Matter is merely the sign of motion, and
mind the sign of matter or motion, call it which you
prefer. Certain combined factors of acceleration
appear to our eyes as minerals, animals, vege-
tables, fluids, or solids, &c., according to their
specific proportions of velocities. A principle
must have some inherent want. Motion requires
to attain a universal homogeneous equilibrium,
and it is its ununiformity striving to right itself
which creates those temporary phases of exist-
ence which we describe as planets or life. What
we call elements are merely differently-propor-
tioned factors of velocity in the struggling infinity
of ununiform motion. Now the similar but
separated factors of acceleration, chemical or
mental, composing the entirety of uneven motion,
seek to unite and their desire to do so is what we
designate (in regard to that form of motion called
matter) attraction and (in regard to that conscious
form of motion resulting in life) affinity. This
they are unable to effect owing to their mutual
inter-relationships whence results that endless
panorama of permutations and combinations now
comprising infinite existence. The whole prin-
ciple of motion being in a state of want each of its
component factors and particles must be similarly
circumstanced, and hence an everlasting system
of destruction, disintegration, and regeneration or
renovation. The principle of motion is the essen-
tial energising and eternal principle of the uni-
verse. What are termed natural forces are
essentially motional, for all things are formed,
energised, and vitalised by motion. It is motion
which is the real substance, the essential and
enduring principle, gross matter being but sub-
jective and merely a mode of motionary presenta-
tion to our bodily sense of sight. Through what
is known as magnetism, motion in certain ratios
of acceleration demonstrates itself as life. Life
in all its forms is but the chance result of
atomic vibrations. All human actions are
but the products of brain substance, vice and
virtue being its effects. Soul or intelligence is
the multifarious phenomena of consciousness—
this assemblage of states being describable as
hope, fear, joy, sorrow, pleasure or pain—all which
are merely the phenomena of atomic vibration.
The brain is the instrument of the principle of
motion, and thought its function.
# # #
The question now arises—what should mans
aim in life be under this system of universal
want? To decide this it is first necessary to
recall the manner wherein this and other planets
are primarily formed. The laws of motion caused
us first to become disintegrated from some such
body as the sun. When a world 1 ke ours first
settles down from an incandescent state into a
more solid form, the decrease in temperature and
increased concentration of the various particles
of which it is composed thereby force the germs of
life in their lowest developments to arise. The
student of Haeckel or Darwin will be easily able
to comprehend how in the first instance foliage,
then shellfish, reptiles, animals and men were
consecutively developed in proportion to the
diminutions of heat. As the temperature goes
on decreasing, man’s chances of continuing his
individual existence under his present form must
gradually become smaller and smaller. He must
either find means of living under new circum-
stances, or perish in toto. Now, isolation is fatal
and impossible to the interests of any single factor
of the whole system of universal wants. No factor
of the whole can obtain permanent satisfaction
without the whole itself being in a state of satis-
faction, neither can the whole do so as long as
there remains one dissatisfied factor. Should each
factor composing a united whole obtain its desire,
the universal equilibrium would be reached, and
motion, then uniform, would constitute a state of
universal rest—he., vacuity.
# # #
Isolation being fatal to the interests of any
phase of the great system of universal wants, it
follows that man, one of its smallest factors, must
endeavour to render his desires and those of his
fellow creatures as much identical as possible, for
unity is strength. An insult or danger to one
man is a menace to us all, for we never know but
that it may be our turn next. Investigators of
social problems have discovered that it is of no
use attempting to elevate the principles of a select
few, and now advocate the education and improve-
ment of the moral and physical condition of the
masses. The science of evolution explains how
those animals of inferior physical capacities but
superior social proclivities, have survived and
superseded their stronger but more unsociable
rivals. In the case of humanity it is most im-
portant that all should realise this special ten-
dency directing the survival of the fittest. Good-
ness and sympathy has been forced upon man, or
we must have deteriorated instead of improved in
knowledge and power century after century. By
extending our sympathies and facilitating our
means for the acquisition of popular knowledge, we
elevate our principles, generally improving our
moral and physical individual conditions, and
thereby removing the occasions for criminality.
A sympathetic man is a progressive being, but an
unsympathetic is a retrogressive. We all love
our children, and they in their turn will cherish
theirs from generation to generation, and hence
their future interests must be ours also. Now it is
highly probable that by some natural law a comet
is now on its way for this earth’s future destruction.
Or possibly, the great flood of which Agassiz
speaks, may be preparing itself to destroy all
animal life from off the face of this globe. At any
rate this earth cannot remain always in its pre-
sent state, and our successors must either acquire
the means of averting any natural calamity or
perish in a body. Man being, however, able to
comprehend the principle and theory of existence,
and knowing the utter impossibility of any such
factor as the attainment of any thing beyond
temporary happiness—by reason of the impossi-
bility of any factor attaining permanent content-
ment except by identifying itself with, and merging
into, an entirety of continuous uniform motion or a
state of universal vacuity— must be content to
strive for a fair share of ordinary mental happi-
ness and the maximum possible amount of im-
munity from personal bodily injuries, either from
material causes or through the agency of surround-
ing inimical existences. The man devoid of the
slightest wish to benefit his fellows, either by
means of his geniality or works of public or private
benefit to those around him, is unfitted to live.
An unsympathetic person is dangerous to society
at large, for it is only by our having a necessary
trust and faith in each other that we can secure
our present welfare or improvement mental and
physical in the succeeding generations, whose
future existence depends upon their beingmentally
superior to their preceding forefathers. Hence it
will be seen that existence will forever be cn cerclc.
* # *
After death the chemical atoms (or visible
powers of dissatisfied motion) of which we are
composed are carried away to temporarily satisfy
other factors of the system of wants, each material
atom power of motion retaining its natural
capability of joining with other combinations and
producing subsequent phases of moving existence.
Regarding the theories of human after-life it is
quite possible that a modified counterpart of the
deceased may continue its individuality in-
definitely, but, of course, subject to the necessary
laws of evolutionary alteration. A gaseous
spiritual development of the individual may form
one of the progressive features of the system of
evolution, the grosser materials of the body at
death reverting to those to which they are nearest
allied and the finer attaching themselves (if not
absolutely assimilating) to those phases of nature
of which man as yet has no knowledge. Our
successors, however, by means of their increased
knowledge may discover the elixir of life and
rejuvenate themselves at wid or possibly electrify
the dead into life. The knowledge they will
possess will enable them to avert or neutralise any
such natural perils as invasion by floods, comets,
increase or decrease of temperature, &c. They
might be able to alter the orbit of our planet or
merge it into another if it should appear desirable.
To obtain omnipotence and omniscience is the
final goal of human desire, but the obtainal of
everlasting happiness means a merging into a
universal vacuum. This can never be done, and
this is the reason why the system of universal
wants, the principle of uneven, ununiform motion,
must be endless and ceaseless to all eternity. It
has now been shown that virtue is more to man’s
interests than evil, that sympathy is indispensable
to his progress and existence, and that isolation is
fatal thereto, that everything in nature is per se
selfish, but that our only legitimate form of
selfishness is that which seeks its happiness in
that of others as the means of satisfying its wants.
As a religion, this has at any rate the merit of
logicality, whereas those of theological theorists
are shrouded in clouds of illusive words and
dubious morality.
CHARLES JUNOR.
The King of Portugal is ill, and his trouble
is said to be caused by the injudicious drinking of
cold water. Such a state of things is so unusual
for a King, that this statement must be accepted
with profound caution.
Thus Professor Francis William Newman
(the late Cardinal's brother) :
A nobler religion is dawning on the world, which will
unite the nations by free thought, not by dogmatism, and
will establish a more general good-will through justice
than endless talk about love can over produce.
Mr. Tints. Playfair has donated 2000 lbs. of
meat and 1000 loaves of bread to the distressed
Sydney strikers. Hut for the fact that Playfair
is a joily good-hearted man, who never sies any-
one go hungry, we might have pointed out that
hie seat for West Sydney is just now a bit shaky.


Cup Clothing
Regarded even with the eye of faith, Flemjngton
wasn’t very frocky on Cup-day. The truth is that this
delirious annual outburst is becoming rather vulgar—the
fact of its,being held on the most virulent kind of public
holiday fully accounting for the pips in the pippin. In
the yice-regaj ( enclosure, Mrs. Aeland Hood, represented,
th<j. vanished Qqpntess in a pale-maize muslin dress
spotted,in white, narrow sash of. yellow satin ribbon and
bow collar of, the ribbon, small hat in white lace straw’,
trimmed with w hite chiffon and feathers, white spot veil.
Lady Carington, who was kept busy bidding farewell
almost all day, wore white silk and silver apd goldgalon,
bonnet in maize net, green velvet and black feathers,
black silk parasol with bands of black lace insertion over
white—the same costume, in fact, that she wore at her
Sydney farewell reception. Lady Constance Coombe in
pale-grey woollen, with the upper sleeves of grey bouffant,
the under part of line white lace, the bodice trimmed
with lace, fiat in tinted straw fixed with pink ribbon
velvet, fuchsia and pink chiffon. Governor Tlopetoun
was irresistible in mouse-grey, with a white vest and,
horse-shoe pin in a lie of striped pale-blue. Baron
Carington looked tired out, and wore the same old blue
scarf and a red-and-white carnation button-hole. “His
Excellency” Admiral Scott was magnificently combed
up, with a grey hat, a purple tie, and a cluster of lilies of
the valley in his slick-cut coat.
But where are the styles—the Cup styles which are
supposed to show the Australian female the latest way to
drape her waterfall and juggle with her long black hair?
The most awesomely-novel get-up was a long cape reach-
ing to the hips and a straight-round skirt, both of helio-
trope bordered with black, the whole made in accordeon
pleats ! The effect w'as that of a double lamp-shade on 1
two feet. Catogans—W’hei’e the hair is plaited or coiled
or doubled up so as to loop low’ over the nape of the neck
—were sported by the girlish contingent, but the furious
frizz sagging backwards from off the apex of the bump of
philoprogenitiveness had all its own way as of yore.
Occassionally flowers were carried. A mignonette-green
silk covered with flue black lace was improved by a posy
of mignonette. Potter sashes; about as w ide as tape,
were adopted-by sw’eet simplicity. There was a tendency ■
to mingle howling contrasts in your - topping-off - one
well-turned-out lady had a tuft of gas-green in her hat
balanced by sky-blue wings. Semi-trains were not
fashionable, though dresses ran long'-at the back, and one
or two confident natures bad bared their throbbing'
throats below high-water-mark, so to speak, w ithout any
natural provocation. White was; without doubt, the'
favourite colour. Almost all the parasols were white
furled gamps, and the'bundle-y arrangement of flounces
of shadeless chiffon were simply nowhere. The white
dresses were mull, silk, and nainsook, and their 1 number
gave the lawn the appearance of a shearing-shed after the
excitement is over. ■ i • *• •••
To individualise some of the Cup clothing, I may state
that Madame Patey was regal in purple Silk flowered’ in
gold, the bodice made with a jouane edged with gold
galon over a front of folded deeper purple'silk‘with a fold
of yellow chiffon at the neck; a long scarf of purple silk
ending in gold tassels tied on the left hip ; coronet bonnet
in gold straw purple velvet and blackberries. Mwra
Kemble was perhaps the besj-turned-out woman present. 1
The foundation of her gown was white silk; the skirt
covered with l 'white chiffon embroidered at artistic
intervals with clusters of violets and leaves done by hand
in natural-coloured filoselle, side panel of accordeon-
pleated white lisse, the skirt finished with three
pinked-out silk frills in white, green 1 and violet
silk; the bodice covered with floral chiffon, as also
were the ridged gigot sleeves 1 ; jouane bordered in
green silk with front of pleated lisse, the edge' of
the bodice finished with violet ribbon in two shades ;
coronet bonnet in tw r o shades of violet velvet with cluster
of violet and green plumes at the back, short velvet
strings ; white chiffon gamp embroidered by hand in
w’hite filoselle ; Miss Nellie Cox vvore pale-cream muslin
dotted in yellow and relieved with lines of yellow and
mauve velvet, hat en suite ; Miss Garran, pale-blue with
yoke and sleeves of puffed white muslin and insertion,
black hat lightened with cornflowers ; Jennie Lee, cream
muslin with sleeves and insertions of guipure, snow-flake'
hat—her son and heir in kilts; Pattie Browne, pale-green
bordered in grey, a crinoline straw hat trimmed with
hops ; Nellie Stewart in pale-pink ; while a large, plump
creature in a scarlet Red Riding Hood cloak made one
reflect that if she had got into that fabulous maiden’s
predicament she could have eaten the wolf.
SAPTHO SMITH.
The New South Wales Railway Commissioners
have, for technical reasons, been compelled to
abandon for the present their scheme to issue
free passes for a specified period to any persons
building residences of the value of £lOOO
between Penrith and Mount Victoria on the
Western line, Campbelltown and Moss Vale on
the Southern line, and Hornsby and Gosford on
the North Coast line. It is well; the Com-
missioners have no right to grant concessions to
the well-to-do man who can afford to erect a
thousand-pound house at the expense of the
man who either can’t afford to build a house or
is compelled to put up one of inferior value.
To excuse themselves the Commissioners point
out that it is merely a business arrangement, >■
and that the Hobson’s Bay Railway Company
in Victoria once offered similar inducements to
people building in certain localities situated on
that line, and in Sydney it was done by the !
Manly Beach Steamboat Company. ■ Surely
these astute officials could, if they liked, under-
stand the difference between private specula-
run on “business” principles for profit,
and a governmental function which is not run
for money profit, but for the comfort, and use of
the copununity. ■<

The Cyp carnival and the Caringtonian
farewell saturnalia have somewhat militated
against the Cora-Potter-Kyrle-Bellew season at
Sydney Royal, but, worse than all, their popularity
was partly played out with their last season, and
now the craze for the romantic in several attitudes,
the tousle-haired in various gowns • and three ’
styles of flopping on the floor, is as intangible as ft
thing that has only-been dreamed about. The'
gushing pair expected, apparently, to take Sydney
by storm with " Romeo and Juliet, “ but,' fihdifig
that business was only payable, announced “ Ca-
mille” for last Saturday, ere then another drop in
the gate-money so startled them that" they
rushed “ David Garrick” to the front ’ for two
nights. Da-vid Garrick is one of Bellevv’s best
mi personations juid the fair Dora as Yiolet, having
fewer opportunities, is not so persisteiftly mad-
dening as. usual. The defection of Musgrave,
whose voice, we are sorry to hear, has hopelessly
left him, Helen Kinnaird and Polly Eifiery has'
weakened the company, and they were much
missed in this play, also in “ Camille, ’’ put up on
Saturday for three nights. The last-named maudlin
and unhealthy creation failed to revive former
triumphs, and “ She Stoops to Conquer ” (staged
on Wednesday) has, so far, not caused any great
strain on the holding capacity of the treasury.
“ Heuo and Leander ” will be put up on' Saturday,
but may not run right through until Johnny Toole
chips in, for the modest management are sceptical
as to how Sydney will vie\V this classical leg-show,
and “’Twixt Axe ftnd Crown,” or some trifle of
that character, may succeed it in a week’s time.

“Impulse,” at Melbourne Bijou, is a
comedy which many people vvill be glad to see
once more, and many others will regard with
interest for the first time. There is not too much
moral lesson about “Impulse,” if we except the
instance of a stupid old baronet, who persists in
riding a fiery steed because his daughters ask him
not to, and nearly finds himself under the old
family tombstone in consequence. The heroine is
a married lady, who allows her affections to be
invaded by a long, thin foreigner, with a broken
accent, and the efforts of all her friends and rela-
tions are devoted to the keeping of this lady
straight through five acts. At the outset they
have to resort to stratagem to prevent the amorous
alien from bolting with her, and afterwards, when
he comes hovering round again like a hungry
pelican, it takes them all their time to keep the
play thoroughly respectable. The lady certainly
appears to mean well at the finish, but the audience
depart with misgivings concerning her impulses in
the event of a fresh foreigner chancing to roll his
eyes in that direction. A vice-retral suite would
inevitably sweep away the self-respect of
such a tender blossom in about ten minutes
—but no matter. The present performance
of “Impulse” bears the B. and B. trade-mark,
and is excellent value for the money. Titheradgo
made Captain Crichton a popular favourite years
ago, and now, in the ordinary course of nature
and art, he plays the part better of yore.
The seducer from Paris, as represented by Cates,

white wig of the father who nearly hunts himself
into, a violent death; and Percy Lyndal rises tOi
th,e occasion when most required, although he too
often relapses into the goody-goody style of talk-
ing which is so peculiarly adapted fo the
narrative of Jonah and the whale. Miss Wil-
liamson is altogether a fascinating picture of the
wife who suffers from Toorakiaji weakness, while
Miss Enson watches the situation and proposes to,
Titheradge with a good deal of womanly charm.,

AJ the Royal they have been doing holiday-
bufsinesg. with “The English Rose,” yet that
English drama of Irish life is not much of a
delight all the same. It contains a very trying
heavy' father who spends his time —until Clyndes
is good enough to wipe him out forever in asking
the heroine what she means by talking to a young-
man in top boots. Whereupon the heroine always
defies him, while the young man expands his
chest, and the rival suitor stands aside and grinds
his teeth. This situation threatens to be con-
stantly recurring, until the father is mercifully
removed as aforementioned. Laurence Cautley
and Harold Russell are still concealing their newly
imported talent under a bushel, but Miss Mary
Kingsley is a vision who has a tendency to grow
upon one, and the chief fault that can be found
with Mrs. George Darrell is a certain air of un-
reality about her face. Her stage complexion
seems not of the world.

the idea ,of .starting a joint-stock company’ to build a i
theatre at that end-of , the town. Shares were taken up
rapidly at first, the ground secured midway between
College-street and Riley-street, the old shops levelled and-»
the Structure commenced,. The building got some 20 feet >
high all round, when the funds gave out. Rurdekin, who
had given a long lease on fairly’ easy terms, stepped in, .
re-erected his simps in Oxford-street and converted the
surplus bricks into a terrace of houses. Poor Paddy,
broke his heart over the venture, and was soon after
gathered to his fathers.

A. G. Taylor’s organ (“sole proprietor?
Willis, M.P.”) prints a letter in winch The
Bulletin is referred to as “a capitalist organ, no
longer independent,” and cautioning the N.S.W.
workmen to send to Parliament “men direct from
the ranks of Labour.” This gives The Bulletin
an opportunity of saying two pertinent things:
(1) That the modest A. G. Taylor himself (who
prints his own portrait and his [auto ?] biography
in his own paper) is not “ direct from the ranks of
Labour,” but, on the contrary, re-enters Parlia-
ment on the Labour ticket via a fat Civil Service
billet, and, like his “proprietor,” cared so little
for the direct representation of Labour in Parlia-
ment that he deliberately went to tho poll in
absolute defiance of the fact that the Sydney
Trades-hall Council had nominated a candi-
date of its own to represent Associated Labour.
(2) That Taylor, Willis and Co. have reason,
and may shortly have additional reason, for
envying the independence of The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is independent because in it
no member of Parliament has any share or con-
trol ; because it is subsidised by no politician, and
depends in no way upon any political or religious
party, or capitalistic or labour organisation;
because it does not offer to sell itself, or
any part of itself, to any association, either
of capital or labour; because its opinions
are purely those of the persons advertised
as its conductors, and because it exists solely for
the purpose of enabling those two individuals to
express every week (with the aid of the brightest
literary staff in Australia) sentiments of which they
approve without reference to the pleasure or dis-
pleasure of any man or gang ; because neither of
Ihe Bu».etin’s proprietors cherishes the slightest
desire to personally advertise himself, or get into
I arliament—an arena into which, by the way, too
many smart, but transparent, humbugs now gam
admission through brazenly exhibiting on the
hustings the mouth-froth of whiskyfied political
insincerity.

A steam-lighter of about 60 tons was
rolling and plunging into a short, choppy sea
within sight of land on the Queensland coast
between Cape Moreton and the Wide Bay bar.
On deck were three men and an overgrown boy ;
on a bunk in the stuffy little cabin was a fourth
man, dying, as he firmly believed, in the agonies
of sea-sickness, than which there is no sort of
suffering much worse outside the recorded pro-
babilities of what may happen to the unrepentant
sinner. On the coaming of the after-hatchway,
smoking a pipe, and (in the intervals of conversa-
tion with the mate, who was at the wheel) tickling
the ear of a sleeping cur-dog with a piece of spun-
varn, sat Captain Smith—it is impossible to get
away from that name when one is compelled to be
accurate; leaning on the engine-room skylight
was the short, thick, salmon-coloured engineer,
and in the door of the little caboose lounged the
long-limbed, slab-sided youth, who Was cook

pipe, in gay and lightsome style, on the deck
of the Possum in the Brisbane River three days
previously; now he looked like a split balloon, and,
feeling that his last hour was at hand, wanted
nothing but to be let die in peace. Three meals a
day had been served under his very nose, as it
were, but when the rattle of knives and forks
warned him of the coming banquet he covered his
head with an evil-smelling rug and refused to be
comforted. The whole ship’s company had done
its individual and united best to make him eat,
but without avail; their standing dish was “stew,”
and he preferred death. Still, they never allowed
a meal to pass without a kindly effort to induce
him to “have some.” First the captain would
try him in a wheedling sort of way : “Come, I
say, Mr. Chappycock, you’d really better try and
have a bite—can’t go on this way for ever, you
know —we shan’t get over the bar before to-
morrow night, if we do then, now let me give you
a plate o’ this nice stew. It ’ud do you a power
o’ good, and there ain’t no sea on now to speak of,
so it ’ud be safe enough for that matter. Here,
Jim, hand this up to the gentleman. No! won’t
have it, won’t he? Well damn it, I can’t do more
than my dooty, but. I hope he’ll be able to see it
out till we get into the bay.” Then the captain
would take the wheel while the mate came below
and joined the engineer at table, and while Jim
ladled out the stew they would both try their
power of persuasion on the quivering Schlaffen-
kopf Look here, you know, Mr. Chappycock,
you’d best try and have a bit o’ suthin’. If you
was to have a plate o’ .this stew now it ’ud fix you
up so’s you’d never know you wasn’t in the horfis
in Queen-street. Ain’t I right, Sandy ? ”
“ Y’ar that, mate. Ma certie I’d be sune deid
mysel’ gin I’d eat naething for three days. An’ sic
a bonnie like stew as yon, too ! It’ll no be to the
creedit o’ any o’ us ye ken for the man to dee o’
stairvation in the meedst of plenty, tho’ he be
but a puir feckless Ceevil Sairvant body. Try
him aince mair, Jim.”
Whereupon the trusty Jim would again advance
to the edge of the bunk with a deep tin plate full of
the steaming compound in one hand and a biscuit
in the other, as a greenish-yellow face, sur-
mounted by a bright red thatch of hair, slowly
appeared from out the coffin-like receptacle, and
a voice, hoarse and broken by tempestuous
heavings, said “Go to ter tevil mit yourself
and you tam shdoo. I haf alretty pefore tolt
you Ido not haf some. I do not haf shdoo for
mine prekfasb und tinner und tea aller time ven
I am retty to die in mine own house. I haf
noding any more, und I go now to schleeps for
efer, und you vill yoost sent my clothes to der
dlelegraph office in Maryborough.” And the
figure sank back into the bunk murmuring male-
dictions on—“Shdoo, shdoo, noding but shdoo,
und shdoo, und—ach mein Gott!”

Five days’ starvation had greatly reduced
the body-girth of the unfortunate Schlaffenkopf
by the time he arrived in Maryborough, but two
days’ spell at the “Royal” had restored his official
vigour, and when he went on board the Possum
at the wharf with the local telegraph authority to
make the necessary arrangements for landing the
shore-end of the cable, a stern sense of duty had
overcome all present recollection of his hideous
sufferings. Jim was in sole charge of the Pos-
sum—captain, mate, and engineer, having gone
on shore for a stroll; and Jim sat on an upturned
bucket in the doorway of the caboose getting
dinner ready. His arms Were bare to the shoulder,
and his “ducks” rolled up to the knee, for the
day was as hot as January days generally are
away up the Mary : in front of him Was a huge
tin dish of Water, and on either side were supplies
of meat, pumpkin, potatoes, and cabbage, Which
he alternately sliced, and pared, and dropped into
the dish.- NoW and then he would stop to ex-
change blasphemous confidences with the cockatoo
about the heat, and anon he Would COol, first one
foot, and then the other, by plunging them into
the dish of water, at the bottom of Which rested
the component parts of the impending stew.
Schlaffenkop’s eyes protruded from his head,
and even the colour of his hair seemed to deaden
by Contrast With the scarlet hue Of rage that took
possession of him ; oh tip-toe he passed the corner
of the caboose, plunged in at the opposite side,
and catching the unsuspecting Jim from behind by
the throat and hair bumped his head furiously
against the stanchion, exclaiming the While
“ Shdoo ! you make for me shdoo eh? Pig, cow,
tevil, you make shdoo mit your tain tirty feets,
isn’t it? Soh, den I now kill you !”
But Jim, recovering from his surprise, had
wriggled himself partially free ahd tackled his
opponent; together they rolled about the deck in
the unfinished stew* and together they rolled over
the low freeboard of fhe Possum into the Mary,
when the unexpected ducking loosened the grip of
each. Jim struck out for the bank, and the punt-
man, aroused by Schlaffenkopf’s yells, pulled
round and picked him up.
There was no dinner worth mentioning on board
the Possum that day, Jim’s explanation to the
Captain being
“ That there Bismarck comes behind me
when I ain’t a-doin’ nothin’ only peelin’ ’taters,
and tackles me by the throat, and boomallys my
’ead up agin the galley, and swears that awful
that nobody never ’eard the likes on, and then
chucks me overboard, and if he comes that game
with me agin I’ll jest,” &c., &c.
Schlaffenkopf merely says “ I loose my hat,
und I spoil my clothes, und my vatch he haf stop,
und I tid not yet kill dat schwein vat haf make
for me to eat all der vay from Brisbane, shdoo,
mit his feets in der vasser. Now ve go und haf
some trinks. Is it not so ?”

Bar the Hawk, the English press assert
that Luscombe Searelle’s “Black Rover,” now
being played at London Globe, is a wild, chaotic
hash of melodrama and burlesque, and that what-
ever his qualifications for the composition of tinkly
trifles for the piano, the scoring of an opera is
beyond him. But if his music be trashy and tune-
less, say they, what of the meaningless doggerel
to which it is wedded, for that no trerm in the
language is sufficiently scathing and it is suggested
that if Searelle as conductor is bearable, that as
composer he is annoying, and as librettist, in-
sufferable. Looking over the book of words we
see no reason to doubt the accuracy of this state-
ment. Here, for instance, is a slab taken at
random: —
And every night upon the shore,
When the sea and sky are dark
Above the tempest’s horrid roar
You can see the Black Rover’s bark.
The metaphor here is somewhat mixed, and one
suspects at once that Rover is a dog, and that the
writer substituted the word “ see” for “hear” by
accident. “Above the tempest’s roar you hear
black Rover’s bark,” reads more lucidly and con-
tains the elements of probability. In Searelle’s
version all the writer strove for was rhymes ; sense
and rhythm seemingly didn’t concern him. His
company, barring Shiel Barry and Ludwig, whose
salary is £6O weekly, get beans, and Miss Blanche
Fenton is politely requested by several critics to
retire and take lessons.

Henry Varley asks by what right the
newspapers publish day by day the quotations of
the betting-market. Sir Hercules Robinson once
asked old Jqhn Fairfax the same question, as a
reply to some strictures by “Granny” on horse-
facing, with the result that the “ odds” list dis-
appeared froxn the S. M. Herald during old
John’s lifetime.
At the Cup every real swell wore a “ naii-
kaag ” —either grey or black—and it was <de riyueur
to sport a grey get-up right through to your hat.
The most noticeable male fad was that the best-
groomed man always wore gloves to correspond
with his coat —grey with grey, brown with brown,
and s'o on. Buttonholers were rekerky, but not
large (carnation and lilies of the valley were
favourites), and collars were turned back at the
corners.
This is the story
of a wedding which
didn’t come off, and of
two loving hearts that
were trodden underfoot
by the hoof of calamity.
The parties to the trans-
action reside in Brisbane,
a sultry city, with a
defective water-supply
which runs by fits and
starts, with intervals
between when the fit is
over and the start hasn’t
begun. Consequently,
when theßrisbanecitizen
wants a bath he simply
escapes out of his clothes
and sits down under the
tap, and waits. When
he has waited till he is
dead-tired, and not a
single drop of water has
come, he gets into his
clothes again and goes
away to spend a week at
the seaside, leaving the
tap turned on by mis-
take, and whenever he is
gone the delusive fluid
comes with a rush, and
floods the room, and
soaks through into the
apartment below for six
days and six nights.
Then it stops running
just 45 minutes before
he gets back, and there
is no water again for a
fortnight. It was this
local peculiarity which
broke up the two lovers
already alluded to, and
scattered their hopes like
an eye struck by dyna-
mite. The bridegroom—
a newspaper man —was a
stranger in the land, and
on his wedding morning
he rose early and climbed into the shower-bath.
He turned the water on just enough to
make him reasonably damp, and then he
turned it off again, and smothered himself
from head to foot in soap. When he could
hold no more soap he. turned it on once
more—or rather he tried to do so, but there was
no water there. He got one eye open with diffi-
culty and inspected the pipes, but the soap got
into it, and he closed it hurriedly. In his igno-
rance he fondly imagined that the refreshing fluid
would come back in a few seconds, so he sat on
the edge of the bath to wait. He kept on wait-
ing. An hour passed slowly, and the soap had
dried on him, and he grew wild and began to de-
nounce the Corporation of Brisbane as a gathering
of hogs, dogs and devils, but no good results
followed. He also began to get cramped, so he
spent the next hour sitting on the floor, and using
language which would have made his best girl’s
hair run cold and her blood stand on end, and
then he crawled back into his bedroom, kicking
his clothes in front of him, and tried vainly to get
the s<>ap off with the hat-brush. Next he
attempted to remove it with cod-liver oil, and
when that scheme fell through also there were no
more available liquids left in the house except
gum and ink. At this stage he lay down and
held on to the floor, else he would have blown the
roof off with an explosion of sentiment, and lest
he might do some damage he hid himself under
the bed and cursed inwardly. The mattresses and
other fixings helped to muffle exterior sounds, so
he stayed under the bed for two hours and a-half
before it struck him that there was a dull
sound of rushing water somewhere, but when he
fled baek into the bathroom he found that though
the water had evidently been running for thirty
minutes or so, it had just stopped again, and he
was in time to catch the last drop on the top of
his head, and that was all. Human endurance
gave out at this point, and he swore 28 or 29 times
louder than he had ever sworn before. Naturally
enough his landlady came upstairs, and asked
him through the keyhole what was the matter, but
when he bade her clear out because he had nothing
on except one drop of water on his head she
retired in disorder, and set it down to drink. It
was about four o’clock in the afternoon when the
bride’s brother came along with thunder in his eye
and a large stick in his hand, to demand why
nobody had turned up at the altar, and when he
tried the bedroom-door he found it locked. Then he
demanded admittance, and in response there arose
within the hoarse, idiotic shriek of a dry maniac
covered with soap. The sufferer’s reason had
given way beneath the strain, and he had emptied
the gum and the ink over himself, and then
climbed up the chimney. He was dragged out
with difficulty and removed to the local asylum
where he has a shower-bath every morning, but
his case is generally regarded as hopeless. The**
is a settled gloom upon his soul, and the spark n#
intelligence has fled for ever.

“ One of the Damdest!”
(For The Bulletin.)
Most of us think that we have in our time
known queerer characters than we ever read of.
On the diggings, in ’52, a mate of mine from “the
other side ’ told me of many “superfine scoun-
drels,” as he called them, whom he had met.
He would wind up his narration with the pithy
remark that the individual spoken of was “just
one of the damdest!”
* * #
Personal knowledge of a man always gives
additional interest to what one has to tell of him.
It is too hackneyed to repeat that truth is stranger
than fiction, but there is no form of words more
exactly describing what we have all experienced,
however small our powers of observation. We
have all encountered peculiar specimens of
queer character—champion punsters, humorists,
natural actors and unnatural demi-devils, that
have been to us as beings unknown to others and
more interesting than we have ever read of in
books or seen upon the stage.
Let me tell of my champion Scoundrel —one who,
in American phraseology, lay over all others whom
I ever personally met with. That he escaped
both the galleys and the gallows has always been
to me one of those wonders which disprove all
preachings and teachings as to men reaping as
they sow. _ The career of this man and his death
ultimately in his own bed tend only to convince
me that poet Browning is right when he says :
“There may be heaven and there must be hell.”
Grantley _ Wurstman, as he called himself,
though I will not warrant that as his baptismal
name, was first met with by me on board an emi-
grant ship bound from England to America. He
was of very presentable appearance both in face
and figure. Nature tells us in such people how
deceitful are appearances. In the eternal unfit-
ness .of things in this world such fraudulent
exteriors are not the least of our troubles.
Wurstman was sent into this world to play the
part he did, and was fitted out for it in all parti-
culars. He was strong and powerfully built, and
would fight in his rascally proceedings as if he had
the very best cause in the world.
He had been brought up to the medical pro-
fession, but, marrying for money, had never com-
pleted the course of study entitling him to a
diploma in England. To remedy that defect he
had purchased one in Germany—passing there the
farcial examination by which those having the
monetary means could so qualify. Three years of
married life had brought him a family of two
children, and pretty well exhausted llis wife’s
fortune. . In this state of things he had met with
an American lady of fortune in London, to whom
he represented himself as a bachelor. She was
fascinated by him as indeed most women were. His
journey to America was to marry her quite re-
gardless of his English obligations.
His time on board ship was passed at the card-
table, at which he proved for the time a successful
gambler. Before leaving America, which I did at
the end of a year, he had married as he intended,
and had gone travelling with his new wife. To one
whom he met there, who had known him in earlier
years, he represented that lie was a widower, and
all he said, right or wrong, was always taken as
gospel by those with whom he talked. It was a
gift of nature that this untruthful and unprin-
cipled man impressed others in a totally opposite
way. A lie from him was accepted in preference
to truth from others. He possessed a “ presence.”
to be felt favourably if not defined, and his
manners and address were all in his favour.
Three years afterwards I met him m Australia
—again a hard-up adventurer, and again passing
as a single man. Gambling had gone wrong with
him, and some speculations, by which he tried to
retrieve himself, had been such failures that he
had been forced to fly. He was accompanied now
by a youthful actress on whose earnings he ex-
pected to live. As she was a “frost” on the
Australian boards he was forced to look out for
himself. . As for her, she had to do the same, and
their limited partnership came to an end. On his
part it was one of no liability.
Wurstman now advertised for a partner with a
view to commercial life. He found a new arrival
having £lOOO of capital. Wurstman proposed its
investment in cheap jewellery, with which they
should start as salesmen in up-country and out-of-
the-way places. The ability to quadruple their
capital by so doing was asserted by him as a cer-
tainty. He carried his point with the capitalist
and the venture was agreed upon. Wurstman’s
plausibility was so apparent that there was in
that alone an inducement to utilise him as sales-
man. An office was taken while making arrange-
ments for parcelling out the goods and settling
the details of the tour for the sale of them.
The jewellery was purchased and taken to the
office of which the capitalist-partner of the pair
had the only key. He did not know that Wurst-
man could pick a lock with the greatest ease, but
next morning the door was found to be open and the
jewellery gone ! It had all been removed during
the night, and no clue left as to the robber.
Wurstman’s simulated suprise was well acted. He
was off at once to the police-office to give informa-
tion of the robbery, and to the printer to get
bills posted offering a reward for the recovery of
the stolen goods. The detectives were, lie said,
delighted with the zeal he showed. His supposed
presence with them was to be taken, by -his be-
fooled partner, as the reason so little was now seen
of him by that individual. After a month the
befooled one finding no hope of recovering any-
thing of his lost capital took his homeward de-
parture—a penniless man.
Wurstman’s success in this venture induced its
repetition in another like attempt. His advertise-
ments met with reply from one Knoulton, lately
landed from Liverpool. He was not long in hear-
ing of the fate of his predecessor, and so took
better care in the matter. He slept in the room
in which the partnership goods and assets were
kept. These were locked up in a Milner’s safe, of
which he alone had the key. As he had in-
vested £l5OO in these purchases such care
was, Wurstman himself said, quite commendable.
Over a supper one evening, Knoult m took more
f V 'ii l TiV ian ie '-^ o| dd have done. From what he let
fall Wurstman was not long in learning something
further. In a pocket of a coat left in the office
some letters were found which revealed Knoulton’s
name as being only an adopted one, also that he
had left Liverpool, in which he was known as
‘ Williams,” with nearly ±l2OOO of embezzled
money.
Here was material for Wurstman to work upon !
By next mail he quietly sent home full particulars
of the whereabouts of the defaulter. Also that he
would be happy to assist in his apprehension and
the recovery of the money. If a warrant were
sent out the arrest could be effected, and Williams
deported back to Liverpool. The man was all
that Wurstman wanted to be rid of. As to the
money, or the property it now represented, he
would take care of that. It was necessary only
in the meantime to make as much profit of it as
possible, as also to see that the assets were kept
not in money, but in a portable and easily
realisable form. When Knoplton was in custody,
and so commercially dead, it would thus be easy
for Wurstman to administer the estate.
In a few months out came the warrant for
Knoulton s arrest, which Wurstman placed in the
proper police-hands. He did not appear himself
in the affair, at which lie expressed well simulated
surprize. His condolence and sympathy were
taken as genuine by Knoulton, who now entrusted
everything to him. It was noticeable that the
best legal advocate was engaged to appear against
the arrested man when brought up at the police-
court. The inferior legal assistance he had on
his side proved quite powerless in contending
against the insufficiency of the warrant and the
evidence. Strange to say, the police had got pos-
session, by some means,
of letters to Knoulton,
sliowingconclusi vely that
lie was the Mr. Williams
wanted at Liverpool.
Wurstman had, unsus-
pected ly by his partner,
taken care that such
evidence should not be
wanting. Knoulton, alias
Williams, was now de-
ported to Liverpool, but
no money could be found
to take with him. The
assets of the partnership
were successfully claimed
by Wurstman. They
had been bought, lie said,
with his capital, in
which fraudulent state-
ment the unsuspecting
Knoulton supported him.
He relied wholly upon
Wurstman’s promise to
remit his share to his
wife and family at Liver-
pool.
Wurstman now cleared
out at once to another
colony, having “reali ed”
between 'two and three
thousand pounds in this
curious “commerce.”
Able, thus, to turn
round for a time in the
next colony to which he
betook himself, he now
looked out for another
wife. Matrimonial ven-
tures had been neglected
by him while so “com-
mercially ” engaged for
the past year. His
earlier practice with
womanhood —and then-
money could now be
resumed. He was not a
long time in getting
acquainted with a family
of six who had been left
very well-off by a lately-
deceased father. By the
old gentleman’s will each
of his children would in-
herit an income of £4OO a
year on their coming of
age or, in case of
daughters,on theirmarry-
ing under that age—•
with the approval of their
widowed mother.
Daughters relieved
from a father’s control
are very often peculiarly
disposed to matrimony.
It is, no doubt, as
a relief for their grief—
a revulsion of feeling
well understood by
psychological students.
The offer ma d e by
Wurstman, for the
eldest daughter, met, therefore, with her ready
acceptance. He was a doctor and, undeniably, a
very nice man. Evidently, also, he was not a
poor one, and his manner and address testified to
womankind that he was “ a thorough gentle-
man.” When a woman is favourably impressed in
this w'ay there is no opening for prudence or
caution to suggest further enquiries. Love chafes
at delay, and marriage is a magic word with the
majority of spinsters. Hence it was that
Wurstman was accepted as a suitor and a day
fixed for the marriage.
On looking into the monetary position of the
family Wurstman noticed that his wife’s fortune
admitted of being greatly increased. The will of
her father provided for benefit of survivorship
with the children. If any of them died under
age and not married, the survivors took, equally
amongst them, the share of the deceased brother'
or sister. Hence, if two of them died there would
be a yearly income of £BOO distributable among
the remaining four of the family ; £BOO divided
among four gives £2OO to each. Wurstman saw
that his wife’s fortune might be so increased
should accidents, resulting in death, happen to
any of her sisters or brothers. As they were
healthy young people such events did not appear
likely. At least not to common minds and casual
observers. Wurstman, however, looked more
deeply into things than do most people.
The marriage took place, and to celebrate it
there was a picnic, of Wurstman’s promoting,
during the honeymoon. This moveable feast was
by his planning to be held upon the banks of a
lovely bay to which the pic-nicers were to go in
rowing boats. The bride’s two brothers, with
Wurstman, would do the oarsmen part of the
business, and the four sisters, with their mother
and two ladies who had helped as bridesmaids,
would complete the party. It is to me unknown
how Wurstman became acquainted with the fact
that of this little party he was the only one who
could swim. It was a fact, nevertheless, and he
had become possessed of such knowledge. Ho was
an excellent swimmer—good at that as he was at
all other athletic exercises.
After the pic-nic luncheon, what more likely
than that Wurstman should propose to the
brothers to have a row about the bay and explore
some of its inlets ? As an hour’s amusement while
the ladies got tea ready it was gladly accepted.
The rowing-party were soon out of sight—turning
some corner of the land which hid them awhile
from the view of those upon shore. Wurstman
knew where he was steering the two brothers to,
and probably acted as steersman for this reason.
They could not see to what dangers they were
nearing, but he could. For that reason, and per-
haps for many others, the boat ran upon a rock
and was at once upset. The struggling and
drowning brothers were, Wurstman said, assisted
by their good-swimming brother-in-law. His
statement that he nearly lost his own life in his
efforts to save theirs was thoroughly believed by
his wife and her sisters. Wurstman, as before
stated, had a gift of impressing all people with
the truthfulness of his statements. People who
did not know the man might believe his words.
Those knowing him well would likely think
differently. Especially so when they recalled the
fact that this deatli of the two brothers added two
hundred a year to his wife’s fortune.
The men of the family thus removed out of the
way, Wurstman became adviser in chief and

general manager for the womankind left. Our
actions, good or bad, are the results of our or-
ganisations physical, mental, and intellectual.
We do not expect grapes from thorns or figs from
thistles. From that which is evil in its nature
nothing but evil can proceed. Wurstman’s ideas
were now to abandon the colonies. To live in
style in Europe-among its gaieties and gambling
tables was his ambition To one whose mind was
everloaded with the crimes he had been guilty of,
a peaceable domestic life was out of the question.
Excitement, such as he desired, was necessary to
him if he would live untortured by those reflec-
tions on the past which must haunt the doer of
such tilings.
Within a year after his marriage I was not sur-
prised to learn that one of his wife’s sisters had
died of fever and dropsy. The death was never-
theless a very curious one to me, and I made
many enquiries about it. I was not long in
learning particulars. Her brother-in-law had
introduced her to one who was a notorious roue
and unprincipled scoundrel. This man had
effected the poor girl’s ruin. Her doctor father-
in-law had persuaded her to take the medicines
which had caused her death, and so added a
further increase to his wife’s income. He had, as
a doctor, signed the certificate of'cause of death
and seen that no inquiry was made into it.
A visit to Europe was next proposed to his wife
and two surviving sisters. The mother assented
to it as some relief to them from the grief they
felt for their late sister’s untimely death. It
afterwards turned out that Wurstman had in-
duced botli of the young women to raise money to
a large amount by mortgaging their income.
There was no need, really, for their doing this
and taking with them £5OOO for their European
trip. Wurstman had no doubt, as their pS
adviser in the matter, his own evil motives and
those alone actuated them in what was done

To be immediately published : “In Middle
Harbour and other Verse; chiefly Australian.’ l
By Thomas Heney. London : Kegan, Paul,
Trench, Trtloner and Co. Price, 4s. In thi s
volume, the writer has endeavoured to convey
his vivid impressions of the life and landscape
of the pastoral regions. Mindful of the admirable
work in such books as Mr. Farrell’s “How He
Died,” and in the columns of some of the weekly
papers, the writer does not claim to have entered
an unoccupied field, but thinks it will be admitted,
by those acquainted with the scenes and persons
of his verse, that it is faithful to the virile and
picturesque characteristics of the life of the station,
and the powerful and strange scenery of pas-
toral territory. In a series of eight rhymed
poems, in three blank-verse poems, and in other
verse,- it is sought to suggest the dominant features
of this free and vigorous life. In “ A Squatter of
’08,” an effort has been made to seize the dramatic
moments of the career of a pioneer squatter driven
under. “Pioneer” is an episode of the opening
of new country in South Queensland. Such poems
as “The Boundary Rider,” “ At the Tank before
Day, ” “ The Groom’s Hut,” and ‘‘ In the Lignum,”
are descriptive. Two poems, “The Shearer”
and “Found Dead,” outline two of the tragedies
of the bush. In these and other verses, the writer
has endeavoured to utilise his knowledge of local
colour derived from residence and travel. The
poem from which the book gets its name is a
lengthy blank-verse study of camping-out, in
which opportunity is taken to introduce a sketch
of one of the most striking incidents of bush-life.
Of the miscellaneous verse not otherwise specified,
suffice it to say it includes ten sonnets, and
several poems of lyrical movement. The contents
of the volume are so far new that they have not
previously been published. They will make a book
of about 112 pages, which can be procured through
the leading booksellers as soon as copies are re-
ceived from London. Of the writer’s previous
book, so competent a critic as Mr. Francis Adams
wrote in warm terms in the Queenslander of
4th December, 1886. This review was re-pub-
lished in the most important Riverina news-
papers.*

Some injudicious friend of Boulanger’s
charges the Duchesse D’Uzes with having given
him 3,000,000 francs ; not for the restoration of
the monarchy, but because she had “dreams of a

the Duchesse, whose only retort, however, is that
the last time she saw the General he was “ getting'
rather fat and somewhat indifferent to politics.”

The insidious malady which is hereditary
in the British Royal family, is showing itself very
prominently in the family of the Prince of Wales.
It has already attacked three of his children, for
the illness of the Duke of Clarence, the weakness

developments of the same taint.
Baron Carington, however interesting he
may have been to the newspapers, showed no
interest whatever in literary affairs. Whenever a
book of any importance has been published in
Australia, as a rule a complimentary copy has
been sent to the different Governors. From all of
them an acknowledgement of the politeness has
been immediately received, with the single excep-
tion of Lord Carington, who consistently main-
tained an inscrutable silence. So says a leading
publisher.
“At 18,” says a Sydney daily, “Mrs.
Langtry, then Miss Le Breton, was as lovely a

18, Mrs. Langtry was a most unpromising and
hungry-looking person with high cheek-bones
and no figure. We have before us her portrait
at 18, by Ouless, of Jersey, which amply proves
that between Mrs. Langtry, the stage-beauty, and
the raw-boned clumsy Miss Le Breton, aged 18,
there is as much difference as there was between.

The re-valuation of the houses and land of
London is becoming a serious matter for some

Hatfield was rated at £3O annually.
The same old story all over Australia.

Replying to those who jibe at America’s
propensity for pension-giving, Carnegie points out
that her pensions are, at all events, given to the
needy, while Britain allows her heroes of Bala-
clava to die in workhouses and the gutters and
gives £30,000 and a peerage to Admiral Sey-
mour, the man who, behind the steel walls of the
British navy, battered down the mud walls of
Alexandria, and General Wolseley, who, backed
up-by all the improved implements of modern
warfare, conquered a horde of naked savages.
Taxation in America is £2 10s. per head.
Eight shillings of this sum is devoted to the
extinction of the National debt, and eight shillings
per head goes towards the payment of pensions to
heroes of the late war. In England taxation is
£3 17s. per head, and the cost of her Government
is four times as great as under the Great Republic.
The Royal Family alone costs Britain not less
than £900,376, while the U.S. Government--
administrative, legislative, and executive —includ-
ing the payment of 413 public servants, costs
£425,000 per annum.
Dear Bulletin, —From an absolutely
virile point of view, the contention of Waddell,
M.P., that old men who propose the enfranchise-
ment of women must be in their dotage stands
good. Nations in the full flush of aggressive
strength make their women rock cradles and sing
to babies instead of talking from and around the
Forum. When the Romans were'world-masters,
their wives had as little to say in public affairs as
had the wives of the Goths and Huns, who came
after them. It is an evidence of the power for
conquest of modern Germany that she of all
nations keeps her women in “their proper places.”
—J.J.
The Grand Master of the N.S.W Orange-
men, with a view to dissipate certain ill-grounded
but popular prejudices, explains that the rules of
the Order provide that “an Orangeman should
support the rightful sovereign, the Protestant
religion, the laws of the country and the succession
to the Throne in the House of Brunswick (being
Protestant).” The Orange Order, on the showing
of its Grand Master, is, therefore, altogether
opposed to an Australian National spirit, and in
favour of our country being governed for all time
by the nominees of the lineal descendant of a cer-
tain Dutchman who has long since been merged in
the dirt out of which he was originally con-
structed.
Says Sydney Daily Telegraph, with its
usual perspicacity : —“ The disc: pies of .State
Socialism in their hatred of profit-making and
competition, overlook the fact that competition
under normal conditions insures the cheapest
supply of the best possible commod ties to buyers.”
The Socialist denies that competition ensures the
cheapest supply possible, seeing that the com-
munity’s idlers are all supported on the profit
charged over original cost, and asserts that the
cheapness of competitive production and distribu-
tion is obtained at the cost of the worker in every
case, Whereas if production for use were in vogue,
goods would cost less to produce and distribute,
while those who did the work would get a pro-
portionately greater quantity in return for their
labour.
Says Lawrence Gronlund :
“Looking Backward” has done Socialism a grand
service. I regard its appearance at this time as a provi-
dential phenomenon. But the ideas in “Looking Back-
ward ” that are original with Mr Bellamy—namely, the
natural love of militarism, equal pay, and appointments
bv retired functionaries—are extremely un-Socialistic.
Mr. Bellamy has accomplished a great work among the
middle classes, just as Henry George did among the
labouring classes. As to Georgeism, or the Single-tax
movement, its days are practically at an end. Any move-
ment for social reform that goes over to the Democratic
camp is lost. Mr. George missed his opportunity when
he ignored the demands of the organised working-men,
and the leaders of the Nationalist movement have made
the same mistake. They have held aloof from the
working-men and have assumed a superior air. As a con-
sequence, the working-men have repudiated the
Nationalist leaders and the Nationalist clubs. But,
Socialism is coming. It is the Socialism in Mr. Bellamy’s
book that attracts and interests the people. I have been
elected Secretary of the Kaweah Colony, which, by the
way, is founded" on the principles of my “ Co-operative
Commonwealth,” and I am en route there now.
Bavousky : “I hate vice, and dislike

Three hundred whales were driven ashore
on the north of Scotland by some fishermen and
killed. The owner of the foreshore at once
claimed a third of their value. The case was
taken into court and has at last been decided in
favour of the men, the judge intimating that,
though the landlord’s claim was justified by prece-
dent, it was based neither upon principle nor
justice, and it was time for a new rule.
Travelling by train at a time when any
Abolitionist would have been lynched in the
South, Wendell Phillips was confronted by a
parson with a bull voice, who yelled out to him :
“So you are Wendell Phillips?” “I am, sir,”
replied the orator, quietly. “Then why don't
you go south and preach your doctrine there ? ”
shouted the little minister. Replying to the
clergyman. Mr. Phillips asked : “ You are a min-
ister of the gospel?” “I am, sir.” “Your
mission is to save souls from hell ? ” “It is, sir.”
“Then why don’t you go to hell and carry on your
mission there? ” said Phillips.
A Collins-street eyesore is being pulled

Assembly Hall, formerly the Scotch Ivurruk of
Rev. Ramsay, a celebrity of thurrutty years ago,
when he ran the race for pawpulawrity with Rev.
I. Hetherington, of the opposition kirk, over
against the opposite side of the way. Each must
have his steeple; Hetherington’s had to be pulled
down because it was crooked —what waste of
money ! All as much forgotten now as if they
had been the learned pundits Ptah and Taphanes,
in the reign of Sanchoniatho, 5000 years B.C. But
they “copped the coin.”

When Cardinal Moran paid a return-visit
last week to the French Admiral in Sydney Har-
bour, a thundering salute of 16 guns was fired in
his honour. So far as the hospital patients are
concerned, the effect of this absurd and anachron-
istic display was just as appalling as if the shots
had been fired in honour of the Devil.
* * *
Which reminds us of a certain Bishop of
Malta who insisted on the sentries coming to
“attention” each time ue passed, and of a com-
plaint made because the general in command at
the island put a stop to this salute. _ the Bishop
complained to Wellington, who replied that the
general was quite right, and that the only “atten-
tion” the Bishop was entitled to from the troops
was “attention” to his sermons.

At a banquet given to Earl Jersey, at
Banbury, he spoke en martyre of the “ sacrifices'’
he was making in order to enter on his governor-
ship, and the English correspondent of an
Adelaide paper says it is rumoured that he was
“over-persuaded by Lord Knutsford into accept-
ing the post, and really regrets his decision.” If
this depicts the situation, no time whatever
should be lost in letting him know that Australia
has no desire to be “beholden ” to him that the
Land of the Kangaroo cannot afford to be
regarded as under an unextinguishable obligation
to an individual about whom nothing is known at
this end of the world except that he has red hair,
a big bank-balance and a wife who talks in public.

For calmness Sydney “ Bongtong ” takes
the cake. A Sydney sassiety lady asked Lady
Carington “if she would not be sorry to leave
them ?” the “ them ” meaning the Potts-Point-
cum - Darlinsr - Point “push.” Lady C. smiled
sweetly (as usual-) and said she was just a trifle
anxious to go home and see her ma.

An affecting incident noticed in the crowd
assembled to view the departure of Gov. and Lady
Carington from Government House, Sydney, the
other day, is worth relating. A delicate, welL
dressed girl of about 16 was standing holding by
the hand a younger si:her of about 10 who was
sobbing violently. “What is it? ’ asked a kind
lady ; “is she crying because dear Lady Carington
is going away ? ” “ What are you givin’ us ?” re-
turned the elder damsel; “ she’s blubberin’ because
I jolly well spanked her J”

The Jersey boom lias set in early. There
is a Jersey-terrace in Woolloomooloo, and there
are Jersey refreshment-shops in every suburb,

change for J’s.
* * *
Jersey, like Carington, “ can tell you the
age of his mother,” when asked. Good old square
and compass ! Wethinks the lion and the unicorn
should be deposed and the tools made supporters
of the Royal arms. Is the lodge tyled ? Yes.
Well, God save the Queen and the Prince of
Wales and Gampridge and Battenberg and turn
out good, loyal throne-supporting craftsmen. So
mote it be. Yah ! Should this kind of thing
continue much longer the French, but cosmo-
politan, Masonic Order of L’Orient will rule in

Governor Kintore, now that his wife if
away, becomes desperate. He proposes to travel
overland from Port Darwin to Adelaide abqutu
next March, and will be accompanied by but one'',

him not to do this, as the journey is looked upon,
even by bushmen, as not devoid of risk.

Sir Alfred Stephen, K.C.M.G., aged 88,
has been once more sworn in as Acting-Governor
of N.S. Wales. Is it not time (now that the feud
which was said to have existed between a lady of
colonial title and a former occupant of Govern-
ment House, Sydney, has, with the'occasion of it,
ceased to exist) that the old style of swearing-in
the Chief Justice should be reverted'to ?

When you come to think over it, what an
immensely funny thing it was for Milner Stephen
to write to Lady Jersey, whom rumour speaks of
as a Buddhist, asking permission to cure her by

T. S. RICHARDSON,

Sydney, has, as pointed out by The Bulletin all
along, chiefly proceeded from the non-professional
residents of that fashionable and, in some parts,
beautiful street, who think the site too good for
poor people stricken down by illness. However,
the Legislative Assembly, by an overwhelming
majority, has assented to the view so frequently
expressed in these coluinns, that the city’s most
beautiful site should be devoted to its central
hospital. Premier Parkes and Mr. Abigail are to
be congratulated on the energy displayed by them
in securing for the hospital what is probably the
finest outlook enjoyed by any such institution in
the world. It can, however, hardly be said that
they have hurried the matter.

Olio of the wealthiest lqcn in Geelong,

The foundation-stone of the Burton-street
Tabernacle, Sydney, has been laid with much
ceremony. The spot where the stone has
been well and truly laid has a history of its own,
it being the site of the little cottage in which
“ Bishop ” Bailey used, for many years, to run his
matrimonial business. Poor old Bailey died poor
though a “Bishop,” while Parson Fullerton made
a quarter of a million out of a similar business.

“saved,” and became at once so popular that he
is likely to be made a colonel. “ Jack’s ” appear-

Ninian Melville continues to point out
that £3OO a year out of the money subscribed for
the Bulli widows and orphans is being paid to a

attending Parliament to assist in getting the Bill
passed, and that the widows arc compelled to
travel from Bulli at their own expense and pre-
sent themselves at the Sydney office to get the
paltry sum of 15s. a week. It is surely time that
the secretary either gave up his post, or took
offices in the district where the people dwell, for
whose relief his billet came into existence.

“A Colonist of Thirty Years’ Standing”
asserts in a Sydney daily that it would be an
injustice to the whole community should the
N.S.W. Government do anything for the starving
wives and children of the: strikers. “Let the
strikers get out of difficulties of their own making
the best way they can,” says he. Suppose this
suggestion is adopted by the Government and the
strikers then resort to the “ might is right ” argu-
ment? What if they should plunder, burn and
slay?—the doctrine of “Colonist” and of those
who think and act with him, would furnish them
ample justification.

Carbine’s Cup.
(Foe The Bulletin.)
Cup Day at Flemington is the great annual occa-
sion on which everybody, or nearly everybody,
makes a point of doing exactly as he did last time.
The same lot of people catch the very early trains
year after year and drop themselves as near as
possible to the identical seats they “ had before ”
m the Grand Stand. Or is it their proud boast
that they invariably patronise the 1 till on Cup-
(tay and run their riotous festivities on lines
sacred to the occasion, having just the same num-
ber of cockshies and things, just previous to or
after the same races as usual. One year, indeed,
they find themselves enjoying “three trows a
penny at Lady Loch,” and the next they have the
same number of “ trows ” at Lady ’Opetqun, but
the condition of affairs is practically unchanged,
and they miss either ladyship with monotonous
regularity. The same people left the course imme-
diately after Carbine won, as beat a hurried retreat
after Bravo’s number was hoisted, and those who
waited for the last great rush for the railway-
platform were merely repeating history. NVe
recognise the screams of the women who always
get nearly squeezed to death at the same old time,
and the voice of the man who yells ‘ mind the
child !” at 0.20 p.m. sounds.to us like an oft-told
tale. We ourselves suffer from the general com-
plaint, and decline a free ride by road on the
ground that we are accustomed to go down by
train from Spencer-street at about noon and
would prefer to fight for the privilege of buying
our ticket. At length, hustled into a carriage, we
proceed to remove the point of somebody’s umbrella
from our eye and discover it to be the same old
umbrella that always gets there. The owner is a
ginger-haired person who seems to have a new
ferrule placed upon the instrument on purpose.
There is a general resemblance between Cup-days
that makes a man feel a year younger than he is,
or a year older than he was, according to hi« way
of regarding things.
# * *
We have a turn for melancholy ourself, and as
we take our place upon our accustomed flagstone
at the top of the Terrace steps, watching carriages
arrive at the members’ enclosure, we notice evi-
dences of the growth of time peeping through the
awful sameness of the festival. Not that Fanny
Liddiard looks older than last year. Fanny comes
in a barouche accompanied by her sister and
another lady, and about fifteen baskets of refresh-
ments. There’s only one gentleman to the fifteen
baskets, so this barouche is apparently the com-
missariat department for a stage battalion. Per-
haps the Press will chip in. We wonder in a vague,
dreamy kind of way whether any useful pars for
“Paul Jones ” will have their source in those
hampers. Miss Fanny wears a heliotrope-
coloured dress, with a gigantic golden butter-
fly on her breast, and her hat is so large
and flat and hideous that we trust it is
the newest fashion. Another comic opera charmer
who climbs the steps at about this time
is Miss Young, of “The Gondoliers.” Miss Y.
is still very fresh at the game. The gas has not
burnt up her bloom, and she carries a bunch of
roses as though such things were not yet valued
according to their cost at the florist’s. Perhaps he
—for there generally is a he connected with roses—
left them at the stage-door—but this is mere
romantic speculation. The fair young amateur is
mostly concealed in a dust-cloak for the time being,
and she passes on like a dream just as our demo-
cratic bosom swells at the spectacle of a V.R.C.
member driving his own brougham, with the
coachman doing nothing in particular on the box
beside him. We make a note of this. The man
who drives his own brougham would probably
send £5 to a comrade in distress, and our chance
of being in distress ere the week expires is con-
siderable. Levien, M.L.A., is a feature among
the carriage people, or, rather, his handsome wife
is the feature, and Levien comes in for the re-
flected glory of her parasol. Of all the sunshades
on the ground this one affords least shade from the
sun and most subject for breathless admiration.
It consists of net veiling studdied o’er with pink
hyacinth petals, and would be invaluable as a
meat-cover. Small flies might get through the
apertures, but not blue-bottles. Altogether it is a
chaste, elegant, useless article of furniture, and
should the proprietor get sunstroke she will do so
to a buzz of admiration.
* * *
Fewer four-in-hands than usual rattle along
into the enclosure, and the muster of high-
class vehicles is smaller than we have seen
it, but the asphalted walk in front of the
Maribyrnong stand is thronged with people who
have left their means of transit behind in the
outer darkness. Creepers and other green stuffs
grow thicker along the sides of the walk every
year, and it is in this district that the increasing
beauty of the show is most noticeable. Yet nine-
tenths of the assemblage never dream of exploring
around amongst the ferns, coffee-gushing foun
tains, and sponge-cake at the back of the afore-
said stand. Such conduct would not be according
to precedent. We go because it indulges our
taste for melancholy to observe how the hand of
Time is mellowing all things in this locality. In
the meantime, still standing on the terrace-steps,
we are thrilled by the, advent .of Mr.'..and Mrs.
“ Titan ” Brodribb. The lady is gorgeous in tan
and Prussian blue, the colours'which Prince Con-
sort will presently carry to the rear for the great
race. Plunging has aged Brodribb considerably,
and he has the air of one who is learning his turf-
lesson well. He, too, sports his colours in his
buttonhole, having backed Prince Consort, who is
fondly believed to have “nothing but Carbine to
fear.” And Carbine eventually pulls the owner
of his stable-companion through. Anon Baronet
Clarke arrives, not driving a coach as of yore, but
in the calm retirement of a brougham. Heredi-
tary distinction seems to be settling in the bart.’s
knee-joints, and he clambers from his equipage in
a manner befitted to an honorary LL.D. Lady
Clarke (who seems to be bowing to everybody
except ourself, which causes us to feel our position
keenly) looks cheerful in a sad-coloured costume,
suggestive of dried sage and professionally known
as reseda. The large buttercups in her bonnet
look as though they came from Paris, and we men-
tally approve of her appearance in the bulk.
Having learned by experience that the great
people of the earth always reach the Cup about the
same old time, we move along after this and get
down upon the lawn in time to glare at the vice-
regal entree.
* * #
A peculiar rumbling sound is heard as Hope-
toun and Co. make their triumphal progress down
the cour.se.__ It is not the sound of cheering, or
hand-clapping, or even groaning. It is the
distant murmur of many voices from the Plat,
calling upon the cavalcade of Mounted Rifles to
“aim low and lay ’em out.” This reception
evidently damped the spirits of my lords and
ladies, and they alight at the private gate in front

STICK TOGETHER, I AM SURE WE’LL KEEP UP LAW AND
ORDER.”
of the vice-regal box with discomposure written on
their faces. The anticipated welcome to Caring-
ton being conspicuous by its absence, Lady C.
pauses at the gate to converse with Byron Moore
while public enthusiasm may be pumped up. Not
a solitary acclamation comes off. Lord Hopetoun
raises his hat in acknowledgment of the ghastly
silence, and as the band strikes up “God Save,”
&c., the royal party march across the lawn, as
though walking to a funeral. The Caringtons
almost look sulky, and the suite evidently can’t
understand why visitors from N.S.W. are not
tumbling over one another in their eagerness to
pelt the Baron and lady with choice exotics and
strew palm-leaves in their path. We are so
struck by this abrupt termination to the Caring-
tonian dream of popularity that we would
start a great demonstration ourself but for
the fear of being left, like a last rose
of summer, cheering alone. Kintore is the
least upset of the vice-regal persons. That
canny Scot has a tight hold of Donald Wallace’s
arm and is getting all particulars concerning the
state of Carbine’s health, preparatory to investing
his bawbees on the champion. Apropos of this —
when Carbine passed the post, Kintore brandished
his belltopper and kicked up his noble heels for
joy. Which was presumptive evidence that he
would have been a long, lank picture of misery
had the tip not come off. He who crows over a
victory usually snivels over a defeat.
# * *
Two races, a long one over hurdles and a short
one down the straight, are run off before the
adjournment for feeding. One year’s eating is
exactly like another’s, and except that the carriage
paddock contained less chicken than last year,
there is nothing worth recording about the annual
refreshment scramble. Perhaps it is easier to
buy a mouthful of something on the ground than
in days gone by, inasmuch as the management
does more than move with the times, and all sorts
of odd opportunities for laying violent hands upon
a sandwich are annually added to the show. A
new oyster edifice on the hill is only one among
many new developments in the direction of lining
the human interior. The drinking-bar down in
the saddling-paddoclc is, however, an everlasting
cause of blasphemy, because the men in attendance
are not much ahead of the garden snail in alacrity
of movement. There they stand, helpless and
wooden, whilst the cursing multitude in front
of the counter slowly dribbles away to quench its
thirst at the fountain in the rear. These alleged
barmen are doubtless sons of temperance, hired by
the Total Abstinence Society to prevent punters
from getting drunk. They are extremely irritat-
ing, nevertheless, and many would-be customers
fling bits of pork pie at their statuesque repose
before retiring to the fountain. One old man
smashes a tumbler upon the counter in token of
disgust, and then belts his bald head until it is
full of broken glass. The paddock becomes com-
paratively quiet, however, whilst the Kensington
Stakes is on the tapis, and we sit under a tree
waiting for the shout that shall proclaim the vic-
tory of the favourite, Thirlmere, with Hales up.
An inspired individual has induced us to back
Thirlmere, as it happens, and our winnings are
going on Carbine for the Cup. Pattie Browne
comes into the Birdcage just at this time, escorted
by Phil. Stuart, commander-in-chief of Ivreit-
mayer’s Waxworks. Pattie is especially lovely
in habiliments of the fashionable sage tint, and
her hat reminds us of Naples. Having once seen
it we could die happy if we felt so disposed. A
great shout comes from Hill, Stand, and Flat, and
we surmise that Thirlmere is winning his rae.
The tumult suddenly ceases and we surmise that
something has gone wrong with the favourite.
We are correct in our suppositions. A dis-
heartened individual comes running into the
paddock with tidings that “the —Baron did
im on the —post, and we curse.the day the
Laron was born. the intended investment on
Carbine is indefinitely postponed.
# .* . *
Nellie Stewart “does” the Birdcage as the
horses are being saddled for the fray. The prima
donna is what the dailies call “ the cynosure of all
eyes,” in a robe which is either all rose or boiled-
prawn colour. Probably the former, because a
wreath of roses to match serves as Nellie’s head-
gear, and we never heard of any angel wearing a
boiled-prawn bonnet. In a minute the place be-
comes crowded with men, and millinery concerns
us no more. An immense public meeting is taking
place, with Carbine m the centre, and Hicken-
botham requesting the favour of a little air for
Musket’s mighty son. 1 hey climb upon the fence-
guards of the trees in order to look at Carbine,
and they say “he'll do,” just as though they
knew anything about it. We have seen Carbine
again and again until we are tired, and feel con-
vinced that hell do, because he always does—so
c on t risk our life m another endeavour to catch a
distant view of his immortal tail. It interests us,
though, to note the melancholy Ramage walking
across to the burly burly with Mr. Donald
Wallace. Ramage doesn t inspire confidence as
Mick 0 Lrien used to do. Ihe race always seemed
won before Mick got on Carbine’s back, and
smiled at the world at large, but Ramage is moody
and silent, and his silk jacket hangs out behind.
Yet he gets there all the same. Carbine is the
first horse to leave the paddock, and, as he
saunters off, the crowd raise three hearty cheers.
Probably they would have done as much for a
glandered donkey if it had been running for their
money. "
* * *
Cuirassier attracted a lot of attention, and
Benzon is still believed in by the admirers of big
soft horses, yet neither looks handsomer than
Whakawai, the black deceiver of two years ago.
Our eagle eye is glued on Chaldean, the only
animal, according to The Bulletin, that is likely
to beat Carbine. We walk around Chaldean, and
generally conduct ourself like an authority on such
matters, but we make nothing much of this
mysterious quadruped except that he is in posses-
sion of good health and a wart on his belly. When
little Tommy Wilson leads Chaldean out on to the
course we leave the Birdcage and devote ten
minutes to pushing our way through the
layers and backers massed inside the betting
boundaries. We get at last to the slope
in a line with the winning post and grow
cynical. The vanity of Cup dresses is never so
vain as during the fifteen minutes before and
after the race. Who troubles then about any silks
and satins, save those worn by the jockeys ? Even
the women forget to look at one another, and the
lawn is only a place from which to view the
struggle that so few of the onlookers are suffi-
ciently experienced, quick-eyed or cool to under-
stand. Not that this year’s race puts any great
strain upon the understanding after Enuc has led
his field round the last turn. Carbine’s colours
come flashing past all the others, they pass Enuc,
and the Cup is settled. Carbine comes right
home at top speed, and the Ballarat colt is mean-
while galloped-down, first by Highborn and then
by Correze, who serve to temper the wind to the
shorn bookmaker by filling the minor places.
“Carbine, when the Cup is won, horse of horses
shall be reckoned,” warbled The Bulletin. And
there the prophecy should have terminated, in-
stead of proceeding to explain that Chaldean would
get in front of the top-weight. Chaldean’s effort,
made a quarter of a mile from home, is not a long
sustained affair, and the horse finishes but sixth
or seventh. Ten thousand hats are waved in the
air as Carbine passes the post; fifty thousand
voices enquire : “What did I tell you all along?”
There are seven distinct outbursts of enthusiasm
over the win, the hoisting of the number, the
return of Carbine, the weighing-in, the owner, the
trainer, and the owner again. In another ten
minutes the enthusiasts are turning their attention
to the next race, and “ the most memorable scene
ever witnessed at Flemington is half-forgotten.
We back the winner of the next race, and the Cup
appears a very uninteresting event by comparison.
* * *
Hopetoun provided the two really humorous
incidents of Cup-day. Shortly after the race he
sidled up to Donald Wallace and delivered a
feeble oration, to the effect that Carbine was the
noblest horse he had ever seen, and he would be
proud to be the owner of such a horse himself,
which gracious admission moved Donald to reply
that it was very good of His Excellency to say so,
and the proudest day of his life was the day when
Carbine won the Melbourne Cup. No reporter
being at hand to jot down these immortal plati-
tudes, wily Byron Moore rose to the occasion by
taking shorthand notes inside his hat. Clever
V.R.C. secretary! Standing there bareheaded in
the presence of his deputy-sovereign, he was all
the while turning that young man to advertise-
ment-purposes inside his cadey. But the grand
vice-regal joke came off at departing time, when
Hopetoun called upon the people of Victoria to
give “three cheers for Lord Carington.” The in-
habitants of the colony were occupied in rushing
to catch the train, or hurrying in the opposite
direction to make bets. Their thoughts were far,
far away from Carington, and they didn’t hear the
pathetic appeal of his pale young friend anyhow.
So Hopetoun and the suite said “hooray ” in a
polite whisper, and Carington, perceiving that the
demonstration was going bung, actually joined in.
Unnoticed and uncared for their lordships cheered
themselves to the state-chariot and drove away.
Many large sharks measuring up to
14ft. Gin. —have lately been caught in and about
Sydney harbour. Contrary to general belief,
sharks sometimes venture into very shallow
places. The present writer, some years ago, at
Albert Park, Melbourne, saw a man killed by a
shark in less than 3ft. of water. The victim was
bathing in the surf and was suddenly attacked by
the brute, which seized him by the thigh. The
shark was beaten off by a man who entered the
breakers on horseback, but the wounded man died
at once from loss of blood. The bite completely
severed the soft parts of the bather’s limb, which
hung merely by the bone, the cut having been
made as cleanly as if it had been done by one
quick sweep of a surgeon’s knife. How the monster
managed to inflict such a wound remains a
mystery.
It will be remembered that Admii’al
Knowles publicly disclaimed relationship with
Miss Gladys Knowles after her breach of promise
action against Matrimonial News Duncan.
Writing to Miss Knowles’ solicitors, Sir Francis
Charles Knowles, the grandfather of the plaintiff
and father of Admiral Knowles, says : —“ Miss
Gladys Knowles is my granddaughter. She is
the daughter of the late Charles Henry Knowles,
my son, born of Carlotta Knowles, my wife, in
1828. Admiral Knowles is the son of my wife
Emma Knowles, and was born in 1832. Whether
the plaintiff is or is not the niece of Admiral
Knowles, you can now draw your own conclusion.”
According to common phraseology, Gladys
Knowles is at least half-niece to the Admiral,
who, however, under racing-law—whereby two
colts out of the same dam by different sires are
accounted half-brothers, while two colts by the
same sire out of different dams are not accounted
near relatives—is justified in his assertion.

Notice to Artistic and Literary Contributors.
Strictly Original matter contributed to The Bulletin
will be paid, for. The Editor will be glad to receive and
consider contributions as under : —
1. Original humorous or political matter, illustrated or
otherwise. (Drawings must be made in clean lines
of Indian ink on white paper or Bristol-board.)
%. Unpublished anecdotes of living celebrities, or people
who ought to be celebrated.
3. Humorous poems (from eight to forty-eight lines pre-
ferred ).
h. Serious poems, of similar or greater length, especially
those suitable for pictorial illustration.
5. Short Australian or other stories, up to, say, 3000
words. About half that length, or even less, will
be preferred.
All Contributions must be W ritten Legibly, on One
Side Only of the paper, and folded, not rolled. The
name and address of the writer must appear, in all
cases, on the MS. itself, and not merely on an accompany-
ing letter or paper. The Proprietors do not hold them-
selves responsible for Dejected Contributions; but ,■ if
accompanied by a stamped, and addressed envelope or
wrapper, every effort will be made to return them.
The Editor does nut, undertake to enter into any
correspondence respecting rejected Manuscripts.
In the new Electoral Bill (N.S.W.) all
ex-Governors, excepting King, Bligli, Darling,
Robinson, and Loftus are commemoiated. The
early explorers Cook, Banks, Flinders, Hume,
Sturt and Leichhardt are also mentioned. Abori-
ginal names get a very poor show. The poli-
ticians honoured are Forbes, Hay, Macleay,
Manning, Parkes, Cowper, Bland, and Went-
worth. One would have thought that such names
as Martin, Robinson, Dailey, Foster, and Lang
were quite as deserving of being thus handed
down to posterity as Parkes, Cooper, Bland, Hay,
Macleay, or Manning—and furthermore, as the
former are, except Hercules R., all dead, while
several of the latter are still alive, common
modesty might have suggested a different course.
But then Parkes never was modest. The name
“Carrington’’ lias been given to the wealthiest
and most fashionable i ortion of the City of
Sydney - which should have been “ The Ex-
change ” division, the ex-Governor being already
sufficiently commemorated by having Bullock
Island called after him.

Exhibition, 1889.
The Referee.
The South Australian Advertiser announces,
when it is too late, that a man called in at its office
lost month, and, as the result of a dream the previous
>ht tipped Vengeance for the Caulfield, and Carbine
For the Melbourne Cup. It was ever thus. This sort of
treatn is never published till the race is over, and the
•{ream that is printed beforehand always uo.s wrong:—
And with him ran a
The dream ended just there. Anybody who wants a
thoroughly reliable tip for the next Cup can have the use
of the above without any extra charge.
* * *
The individual who is allowed to air his racing
ideas in The Bulletin was so stupid as to try to pick one
horse that might beat Carbine in the Cup, but our
“prophet” (a well-meaning Mahdi) has been a consistent
“bonnetter” for Mr. Wallace’s wonder always. When
Melos beat him for the Champion Stakes the victory was
set down in these columns as a fluke, or, in the language
of the dailies, “another instance of the glorious uncer-
tainty of the Turf.” And when Abercorn was the idol of
the hour The Bulletin was alone in advocating (Jarbine’s
claims to be regarded as the better horse, taking his per-
formances in the lump. Nevertheless, the sporting writer
who, after a long period of unbelief in Carbine’s super-
excellence, now assumes him to be two stone better
than Mentor or Dunlop, is probably an idiot. “Great-
ness” in handicap performances is a relative term,
and it is worth the mentioning that although both
O’Brien and Ramage, past and present jockeys of
Carbine, felt confident that he would win the Cup (bar
accidents), they based their opinion not so much upon the
proved strength of the champion as upon the apparent
weakness of the opposition. That he won in the fastest
time on record doesn’t prove that Carbine could have
carried the same weight home first for every Melbourne
Cup ever run. Other records were made during the
week, one of them by the hurdle-racer, Cory thus.
Judged by the Oaks time-test Litigant could have won the
Derby, yet we saw two horses that were unplaced in the
Derby run away from Litigant and Magic Circle last
Saturday.
* * *
The V.B.C. Handicap result proves, as satisfac-
torily as such things can be proved, that the Cup was a
true-run race. Over the mile and three quarters Corn
again beat Entic, who again beat Vengeance, Chaldean,
Little Bernie and others just as in the longer gallop. Anil
now the backers of Correse for the Derby are at liberty to
curse the “glorious uncertainty” which lost them their
brass. Had the pace been better the N.N.W, colt might
have outstayed his field, a supposition which doesn’t alter
the fact that Carbine, by giving him three stone and a
“ losing,” made this season’s three-year-olds look a very
second-rate lot. Megaphone may develope into a real
good one, but at present he is little better than King
William, anyway.
* * *
Within five years at latest the Melbourne Cup
will be a £20,000 stake, provided that the V. It. C. sticks
to its policy of expending the public money on fresh in-
ducements for the public to come next time. ETemingtou
is without doubt the most liberally-conducted show place
in the world, and the management “in front” is account-
able for the immense attendances that ensure good per-
formances on the stage, or course. If the V. R. C. ran a
theatre the constant care of the management would lie to
improve the seating-accommodation, and provide the
ladies with delicately perfumed programmes printed in
gold.
Melbourne Age took the bun for “Cup” tipping
On Derby morning that influential journal published an
unconscionably long doggerel by “Javelin,” to the (fleet;
that Tantallon would either split or beat The Queen or
Melos. On Cup morning the same genius burst forth with
a second “anticipation,” that Melos would be followed
'home by Muriel and Carbine.
* # #
It is said that Donald Wallace’s total winnings
over Carbine’s Cup victory were £35,000.
# # #
Of the thirty Melbourne Cups run for, Mr.
John Tait and Mr. De Mestre won four each, and Mr. 1).
o. Wallace two.
* # #
Ramage is the fourth Victorian jockey in suc-
cession to win the 60-guinea whip presented by Mr.
Reynolds, of the Roval Mail Hotel, Bourke street, to the
nder of the Cup winner.
* # #
In all, Carbine lias run in 36 races (27 of which
he won). He only failed once to get a place.
* # *
jWhen the mighty Carbine goes to the stud his
hrstcolt should be christened “Soil of a Gun.” Which
old Carbine himself certainly is.
# # *
Carbine was bred by the N.Z. Stud Co. an.d
nought as a yearling for 020 guineas by Mr. D. O’Brien, in
whose colours he had a brilliant career as a junior. Then
Wallace bought him for £3000 guineas, and lias won
something like £24,000 in stakes alone with him.
* * #
The Argus, speaking of Highborn, which some-
o! ®ff am hled into second place for the Cup, says sadly
tnat it, would have been a great blow to the public faith
it he s , e00l| 6 horse had been first past the winning-post.”
I rj would, O Attars, it would, indeed. If the second horse
uad passed the winning-post first it would have been a
, surprising circumstance, and if, in addition to that,
i f fla “ been in the middle of the crush, and also left in
,e rear i the public would hardly have been able to con-
tain itself at its surprise at seeing one horse in so many
places at once. And supposing 'the' same animal had been
first and second simultaneously, and there had been no
third horse, but eleven separate animals had been fourth,
and all the rest last, the consequences to hackers would
be too dreadful for words. And yet even that would have
been an insignificant disaster compared with the horrors
of seeing all the horses lose, and the first one not even
get in third, for then the “books” would have scooped
everything ; and again, if the eighth horse had been
tenth, it is hard to say what would have become of the
ninth one, as it would evidently have been surrounded.
There are more dreadful possibilities in the Argus’ theory
than that paper even dreams of, and, for the sake of Aus-
tralian sport, we trust it may be many years before the
second horse comes in first, for in that case the sixth
horse might be eleventh, and Providence only knows what
consequences might follow. In fact, the chances are that
under such circumstances the consequences might come
in front while the cause would follow and shove them
along from behind, and the horses might race backwards,
and have the win first and the start afterwards,
# # #
Rev. Snodger on Melbourne Cup “The Jews
used to worship the golden calf. Now they lead the way
in the worship of a poor brute of a horse.” Mistake.
Nobody worships the horse, or cares a rap for him. Same
old golden calf.
* # #
Mr, Wallace had a bit of luck in keeping Car-
bine tip to the mark for the Melbourne Cup, as he pulled
up very lame after winning the race. Knowing the
champion’s weakness, it was certainly risky work running
him in the earlier portion of the meeting.
* * #
John. Lucas won £3OO on Carbine, so did Harry
Rickards.
* * *
Highborn’s people narrowly escaped a big thing
in the C jp, as they had, we hear, upwards of £57,000
about their horse—nearly all taken at 100 to 1. It was
reported that Highborn had done some wonderful two-
mile gallops, but, as a matter of fact, the gelding never
had a two-mile gallop prior to the race, and never had the
watch ,on him. His veteran trainer, Noah Beale, only
knew tnat the youngster was remarkably well. He cer-
tainly showed extraordinary reversal of form ; not long
previously he was beaten by a field of rats.
# # #
An ex-Sydney bookmaker had a bad time at
Flemington. He laid heav ly against Carbine, at a point
move than the pencillers were giving. When Carbine
rounded into the straight, he rounded for home, but was
not quick enough away, and when the people had done
with him and threw him over the fence he was arrayed in
hoots and guernsey only. *
# * *
It appears that Correze’s in-and-out running
was caused by teeth troubles, and that for weeks the colt
could not be tempted with the greatest dainties. His
recent running, however, shows he has not lost the
phenomenal speed he possessed as a two-year-old, for he
won the V.R.C. Handicap, with 7st. 121 b. up, from an
aristocratic field in 3min. 3sec., the fastest time for a mile-
and-tliree-quarters yet shown in Australia.
# # #
Mr. Frank Gardiner (Mr. Carrie Swain) touched
the books heavily over Carbine’s victory. Report says he
netted £9OOO. He was also one of the lucky ones on
Vengeance for the Caulfield Cup.
# * *
It is said that Brodribb got square on his
Titanic losses by backing Admiral for the Derby and
Carbine for the Cup.
# # #
A Melbourne paper says that the Rev. Walter
Feliowes had a wager of £so(i to nothing from the owner
of Vengeance for the Caulfield Cup.
* * #
Slavin and M'Auliffe used 4-ounee gloves. The
ordinary gloves weigh ten ounces, and in their day Sayers,
Brettle, Mace, Alec. Keene, Paddock, and Broome used to
use 1C ounces. -Contrary to general expectations, Slavin
was slightly better favourite at the ring-side. Guineas to
pounds were laid on him in some instances, and one offer
of £250 to £2 )oagainst M‘Auliffe found no takers, but at
theclose of the fust round the Californian became favourite
at 2 to 1 on. It was prognosticated that in an 18-foot
ring, with such small gloves and such heavy men, one
or other would quickly get his quietus. In fact, under
these conditions fighting is far more dangerous than in a
regular up-and-down fight out in the open.
# # #
Says a London writer : “ M'Auliffe looked all
his inches bigger than the Australian, but he lacked the
muscular development of his opponent, and about the
arms appeared soft and flabby. In addition he was
awkward on his legs, and created a bad impression im-
mediately when he lounged out in a round, lumbering
style with the left. Ilis chest is broad though not
especially deep, and his sides run down from the arm-pits
in almost a straight line. Ilis thighs are enormous, but
his calves lack size and muscle. His pointed chin and
long neck are not those of a fighter. Aided by his long
reach, M’Auliffe took a strong lead in the first round, and,
w ith Slavin appearing a trifle slow, the Californian looked
like winning. Several times he delivered heavily on the
head, quite heavily enough to knock out any ordinary
fighter. Slav in, however, stood his ground, and took the
punishment, in his usual game style, and then setting
about l.is rival in the second round he came up hand over
hand, and won the battle in six minutes. The victory was
most popular. Hats and chairs were thrown about by the
excited spectators, who ran across the room to pat the
victorious Australian on the back, or gain a shake of his
hand. The winner weighed 12st. 71bs. ; the American was
said to weigh list. Slbs., and looked heavier.
# # #
A London paper points out that the Americans
were a deal too secretive about their man. No one was
allowed to see him at work while Siavin’s practice was
practically open to everyone. Probably the task of get-
ting off two stone-and-a-half weakened him, and in some
measure accounted for his sudden collapse. Reading the
various accounts it it made apparent that the Yank was

London judges aie asking: “If the Californian could,
when a novice, stand up 24 rounds against Peter Jackson,
how many pounds would bring the latter and Slavin
together? The latter in his long career has never known
defeat, and, more than that, he has not even sustained a
knockdown blow. Jackson, on the other hand, has
received n heating, and the opinion that he is not a
‘ finisher’ gains colouring by bis fight with M‘Auliffe.”
# # *
The Slavin-M’Auliffe fight lasted just as long
as the Jackson-Smith one- six minutes.
* * *
Slavin, we reckon, has been knocked out; he
has taken a hotel in the Strand, London. But he is also
coming to Australia to fight Jackson ; that is, if he can
tear himself away from the aristocracy.

A New Zealand sporting paper, which devotes
itself to the elevation and purification of the sporting
world, has come to serious grief. There grows in Maori-
land a peculiar species of bookmaking shark who lays
“ totalisator odds in other words, he takes the public
money, not at any fixed price, but on the understanding
that he will pay the same dividend as the inanimate
betting-machine; and for many months the paper
heaved the resources of the English language at this class,
and demanded its abolition. Then it started a totalisator
department of it? own on anew and beautifully simple
basis. Its clients sent their money to the proprietor, and
lie inserted it in the machine, which annexed 10 percent,
of the winnings, and then the proprietor took another
10 percent, to compensate him for his mental exhaustion
and physical wear and tear in looking on at the trans-
action, and the client got the rest. It was a good and
profitable scheme while it lasted, but some of the much-
cussed bookmakers “drew the attention” of the police to
tlie speculation, and the result was £SO fine and an awful
amount in costs.

“ The cowardice of the modern rough who will
kick you in the stomach and jump on you when you fall,
is caused by the suppression of the prize-ring.” Indeed !
It surely is just as brutal if not so painful to hit a man
with your scientifically-directed clenched fist, as to kick
him. The whole matter is merely a question of custom
and sentiment. The French system of, scientific kicking
is quite as skilful a method of attack and defence as Lf
Boxe, and on the whole more effective in a real fight, and
the man who is brute enough to presume on his size, or
skill, or both, to punish a smaller or less skilful, or less
well-conditioned man with his fists should be met with the
first, weapon handy, he it. boot, bludgeon, knife, stone, or
revolver. There is nothing really more moral or manly
in the use of the fist than of the foot. It is simply a
national superstition.

Much regret is felt till over Australia at the
death of Alfred Watson, fifth son of the gallant old George
Watson, starter to the V.R.C., who was crushed by the
fall of the steeplechase horse Explorer at Moonee Valley.
After his accident he was taken at once to Dr. Fitzgerald’s
private hospital, but the case was utterly hopeless from
the very first. This unhappy occurence made the third
fatal jumping accident in Melbourne within about a week,
the others being the death of young Eric Farquharson,
from Ceylon, and a little jockey killed in a jumping pony
race at the Ilipprodrome.

Some time since a certain Australian trainer had
a two-year-old under offer to a young “ Juggins,” who
consented to pay a round figure if the colt did certain
time over six'furlongs. The young ’tin couldn't gallop
for sour apples, but as he started some 200 yards inside
the distance, there was not much difficulty in showing
the required test. In fact, the time was so fast that Mr.
Trainer showed unwillingness to carry oat his contract,
and only agreed on the stipulation that the purchaser
s'.t mid present him with an oil painting of the horse,
“ For,” said the trainer, “ that the colt will turn out a
flyer I have no doubt, and I will then he able to point
with pride to the painting, and say I was the first man to
handle him.” An artist was duly sent out, hut the trainer
was from home, and the painter askerl a stable boy to
show him the colt. “ What for ?” asked the lad. “ Why
I'm going to paint him,” was the reply. “Are you?”
said the hopeful, “not if I can bally well help it, it will
take me a week to wash him clean again.” Fact.

never met anything of Moran’s stamp as a boxer. So far
as Murphy’s show with Griffo is concerned, if was on a

We filled ourselves with cheese and beer,
With ham we loaded up,
We dined on oysters, pork, and (arm
And dreamt about the Cup.
And through the shadows of the night
A mystic horse there came ;
A fire was burning on his head,
And on his tail a flame.
He wore a mane of sickly blue,
A crinkled horn beside ;
Three legs he had, and ninety ears,
And emerald was his hide.
And on his back a hangman rode,
A leper shoved behind—
JMs head was wood, he had no fee t,
And his only eye was blind.
They flew o’er hills and over dales,
And over rivers wide ;
They climbed up wails and towers, and fell
Down on the other side.
And—wondrous though the fact may seem,
And liable to doubt—
They ate each other more than once,
And spat each other out.
The rider had a jaundiced look
And wore a sinful leer,
And eighteen quarts of boiling oil
He balanced on his ear.
And over desert plains they rode,
And over swamps they fled,
While an Evil Spirit clad in tights
Pursued them on his head.
The Rule of the Many.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The men who moil in the shop, on the land —the
men who till the soil—
Have sworn to enforce that highest law —that
they shall eat who toil!
The rule of the feudal despot’s dead in the world’s
new onward swing;
The rule of the people must come instead with
the sovereign people king !
Pampered idlers, list to the words of the new
Evangel's laws —
That man has no right to live who can't for living
show ample cause.
Away with the past, with its king and caste !
The people must be supreme ;
Muscle and brain henceforth must r ign.
Hurrah for the new regime!
Look, ye lords, with affrighted eyes, at thet ilers’
stern array !
And hark ! to the hurricane voice of change, pro-
claiming the world’s new day !
As rotten limbs you are swung on the gale with
the fungus of feudal years ;
For the future will leave but the tree that’s hale,
where the sturdy bud appears !
’Tis Nature’s law that the worthless drift be swept
away by the tide—
King, prince and lord are a worthless load, and
must by that law abide !
No Parliament’s act can alter that fact,
Or the march of mankind stay —
Rule shrivels to dust -rise the Peoples must ;
Hurrah for the people’s day!
What fools to think that a parchment scroll can
give and take at will
What men through ages have fought to decide, or
the throbbings of Liberty still!
Has a drop of ink on a flimsy scroll more power
than a people’s blood?
Can a knot of ribbon resist the roll of Freedom’s
surging flood ?
Ah, this is the world's renewa 1 age, and the earth
is green again,
For it feels the shock of liberty that thrills through
the souls of men !
Be the despot lord but a tiling abhorred
And shivered his blood-built tower ;
Merit’s the gauge in the coming age—
Hurrah for the People’s power !
The earth was made with the fruits thereof for
man in his free career ;
Though tyrants have mocked at that primal law
its day of fulfillment’s here.
Their thrones were built upon human hearts,
Their feet crushed the necks of men ;
But their day is past, and then power departs
They'll never curse earth again !
In the light of knowledge men read their rights,
and knowledge gives nerve to act—r
To act with a free and intrepid soul to turn a hope
to a fact.
Crowned despots quake, the world’s awake
In this bright and broader day ;
The worker must rule in the world’s new school—
Hurrah for the People’s sway !

Persons in need of rest and change are
strongly recommended to the Royal Hotel, Rand-

looking Coogee Bay, this hotel holds the premier
position in this salubrious and beautiful suburb,
whilst a regular and frequent tram-service makes
it accessible to business and professional gentle-
men engaged in the city. The interior arrange-
ments are of the most perfect description, the
furniture, upholstery, ike., being all of the
richest. Mr. Brown's long experience has
rendered him an adept in the catering depart-
ment, and the excellence of the “table” at the
Royal is a prove: b throughout the city; and all
the appointments- viz., linen, cutlery, &c. —areof
the best and neat' st. The bedrooms are all lofty,
cheerful and well-ventilated, the beds are pro-
vided with wire mattresses and the furniture is
of the most luxurious and tasteful sort. The
proprietor has spared no expense in providing for
the comfort of his patrons, and families will find
this hotel specially suited to their tastes and a
nice, quiet healthy resort for their children.
Civility, cleanliness and comfort can be relied on.

The following imDortant fact cannot be too frequently
Impressed, upon the minds of suffering humanity, that
Mr. Gould, E.8.P., of Bradford, has for some time past
and is now giving the Hon prescription for Bitters to
all applicants who send a Post Office Order for Sixpence
for postage. Anyone in possession of this valuable pre-
scription can for lOd. make a quart of this marvellous
medicine, and for Is. Bd. can make two quarts, suffi-
cient to serve for two weeks. It may be interesting to
learn that with this prescription all kinds of hopele-s
cases have been treated with success when all other
remedies had absolutely failed. People who have been
partly paralysed have been relieved or cured with this
prescription, others have had their reason restored;
people who could not sleep have had their sleep re-
stored, others who could not eat have had their appetite
restored; people w! o had suffered for years with in-
digestion and its consequences have had their digestive
powers restored ; people who have suffered martyrdom
with a disordered liver, nervous debility, &c., have
been cured; peopl' subject to an accumulation of
wind and water have found it disappear under its
influence. A gentleman at Lincoln subject to fits
fortnightly has not had a fit from the first moment
ho began taking it. People troubled for years with
constipation have had their bowels become regular under
its infiu< nee. It is a choice, rare, remarkable remedy.
The prescription is simple, it is cheap, it is good. Those
who haven't sent for it should. It will be found safe,
sure, and reliable in a most all adments incident to the
human frame. It is a tonic, alterative, and an aperient
combined of marvellous curative properties. These
important facts may seem incredible, but it has done
far more than is here claimed for it, proof of which is
sent with each Prescription, and it is given absolutely
free of charge to all applicants who send a Post < ffico
Order for Sixpence for postage of the same, Colonial
stamps or coins are useless. A mode of self-treatment
at home has been a long-felt want by all well-regulated
minds, and will be found exceedingly advantageous
to sensible persons who desire to know what they
are swallowing. Address Mr. GOULD, E.8.P., 479,

Wolfe’s Schnapps will make you a new man.
Dear Bulletin, —We are often told that
if these idiotic labour leaders and their financial
followers don’t look out, we shall have all the
capitalists leaving the country —that is, they will
realise on all available assets and put the proceeds
in their carpet-bags and clear out. They will
then, after duly cursing the ingratitude of the
working man, go and seek some country where
there is no such thing as a strike possible—where
the horrid word “Labour” is unknown. Mean-
while, it should be interesting to know what
would become of all the working men left behind
-— presuming that ail who are not capitalists are
workers? (Land-owners, of course, would be
included with capitalists.) Poor workers ! what
would they do with no capitalists to give them
employment, and with no landlords to whom to
pay rent? The thought is too painful. Another
question arises which is quite pertinent and inter-
esting : On realising, how would the capitalist
take the proceeds away ? by draft or gold ? But,
first of all, comes the question : How much would
he have to take away? Let us see. There is
Smith, said to be worth two millions. He would
sell his land, his stocks, his houses, &c., &c., and
then get a draft for the lot, or else, as he would be
going to a place where there were no banks, he
would prefer gold. So he would put his two
millions in his carpet-bag and go aboard the vessel.
Jones, with his three millions, would do precisely
the same, and so would all the other millionaires.
Of course, it will be said that then there would be
a glut in the market of land and stocks, &c., and
big discounts would be the order of the day, or
perhaps the poor, virtuously-indignant benefactor
of his race—the employer of labour—could not
realise at all; and what then? Precisely so. The
monopolist cannot leave us. He must stay, and
he must take his gruel from the hands of the
workers. Who are the workers ? Not only those
who walk in the Eight-hours’ Procession, but
every man or woman who works at all—even the
bloodthirsty “special,” with his pound a week—
even he is a worker, and will be seen, in the good
time that is coming, hand-in-hand with the burly
wharf-labourer, wondering how the deuce he could
ever have been such a fool as to try to suppress
the very man who was fighting for him. And
then how will the monopolist like his “ gruel?” In
anticipation, it is so horrible that he is fighting
hard to avert what he considers a calamity almost
as bad as death itself. He may rest assured, how-
ever, that in that good time he will look back
upon the ‘ ‘ dose of gruel ” as one of the best things
he ever took, for it will have produced that state
of happiness and security which his millions could
never secure for bun.— Xat.

No. XVIII.—Mr. Slyde’s Auction.
[For The Bulletin.]
Mr. E. Augustus Slyde, P.M., Commission
Agent, Inventor of the “Improved Cat” and
Acting Barrack-master (vice Scragge on leave for
a month’s holiday) sat in his office in Barrack
Square, biting his finger-nails furiously.
Mr. Slyde was a “perfect gentleman ” in the
opinion of the leading Bure Merino families of
Sydney. That is to say, he dressed in good taste
wore only a little jewellery and that of superb
quality, was a good talker and dancer, a regular
church attendant, and-in manner was condescend-
ing to his “free” inferiors, suave to his equals
and deferential to his superiors. As to his treat-
ment of “Goy’meut people,” points' of that kind
never entered into any estimate of his gentleman-
liriess, for convicts still under bond were dead" to
law and to society, and almost anyone could insult
and outrage them with impunity. A man who
chose might heap every species of infamy on hij
assigned servants without forfeiting his title to
the name of gentleman if he had money and
breeding to support his claim to it. And/what
any civilian could do with propriety, an official
and especially a prominent and excessively useful
official like Mr. Slyde, could do with unchallenge-
able freedom.
Nevertheless and notwithstanding Mr. Slyde’s
admitted distinction of person and manner he
had one weakness : lie had an inveterate habit of
biting his nails to the quick. He bit them
slowly when he was amiable and good-tempered-
hungrily and furiously when he was angered. And'
he was very angry as he now sat in his office with
a damp, ill-printed newspaper of small size in
front of him. Eor Mr. Edward Smith Hall, the
rascally editor of the vilely-conducted Monitor
had in the current issue dropped the bludgeon
of his crit.cism on to Mr. Slyde’s gentlemanly
head.
* * *
“ We warn the Governor and the Executive Council
that if the man Slyde, who, we are credibly informed, is
to temporarily assume command at the Barracks during
the absence on a holiday of Barrack-master Mr. E, E.
Scragge— What iias Mr. Scragge done to deserve a
holiday ?—perpetrates any more of those iniquities which
the moral (!) circles of Government House term ‘Slyde’s
Auctions,’ the public will hold them personally responsible
for the offence against public decency. It was a siiamk-
kul scandal to appoint Mr. Slyde to the paid magistracy
after the exposure of his attempt to compel two women
transports to sleep in the same room as himself and his
paramour. But it will be trebly scandalous if the crea-
ture thus favoured by the Authorities is given an oppor-
tunity to repeat, even eor one month, the vile outrages
on morality whi-h he frequently committed when
Permanent Barrack-master in putting up to private
auction the charms of newly-arrived female transports.
Let the Authorities beware !”
This was the passage which had driven Mr.
Slyde to the mastication of his finger-nails, and it
will readily be conceded that there was some
excuse for its subject’s irritation. If Mr. E. S.
Hall was profuse in marks of emphasis, he was
decidedly illiberal in the matter of desirable com-
pliments.
“Damn the Grub-street hack !” ejaculated Mr.
Slyde, as he threw the paper to the floor, “ I’d
prosecute the wretch if the statements weren’t
true !” That was his remark to himself. But he
had to repeat it in substance a dozen times that
morning.
He found an aide-de-camp from Government
House waiting for him at the Police Office when
he went to preside.
“His Excellency’s compliments, Mr. Slyde, and
he wishes to know if you are going to take potion
with respect to the article in the Monitor this
morning ?”
“My duty to his Excellency, and will you
please tell him that —er— I shall—er —do myself
the honour —er —of waiting upon him imme-
diately the Court is adjourned and informing
him—er—as to what steps I shall take?”
He was scowlingly glancing over the charge-
sheet in his room before appearing in Court, when
a messenger brought a note from the Colonial
; Secretary. Written unofficially, and with collo-
quial friendliness of tone, it urged Mr. Slyde to
at ouce “institute proceedings to justify Execu-
tive action.”
“All—tell the Honourable the Colonial Secre-
tary, please, that I am considering—er—how best
to act in the matter he is good enough to refer to
—and that —er —I will see him later.”
The Rev. Mr. Marsden, happening to be in the
city from Parramatta, thought he would spend an
hour profitably by assisting in the adjudication of
a metropolitan Bench, so he dropped in to Mr.
Slyde’s court—the Prisoners' Court.
The authorities provided two police-courts in
Sydney in those days—one for Bond and the other
for Free. With a distinct brand of justice in each.
“Good morning, Mr. Slyde—heavy list?” This
as he sat down by Mr. Slyde’s side.

“Oh, good morning, Mr. Marsden, happy to
you ! No, not particularly heavy !”
“I thought it was—-you look so worried !” said
the venerable ecclesiastic, fatherly sympathy
struggling with magisterial dignity in his tones.
(I Qi, s ir, the heaviest charge-sheet never bothers
. i n ’fact,.a real downright heavy list makes me
feel'fresher as I go along; but it’s another matter.
Vou’ve seen the Monitor this morning ?”
1 “That’s a paper I never look at on principle.”
“Very good rule, sir; but, unfortunately, I’m
compelled to read it. Well, there’s a blaek-
o-uardly attack on me this morning, just because
l have taken Mr. Scragge’s place at the Barracks
°“ That’s very wrong, but only what might be
expected from a paper that is so michievously
conducted and has so little respect for the Consti-
tuted Authorities and Church. Have you the
paper here—l would like to see it. Perhaps I
could advise you? ” .
P M." Siyde sent a convict-constable for the
despicable sheet, and the Reverend Samuel
Marsden —“name ever to be revered in Australian
and New Zealand history,” says a Standard
wr jter !—read the paragraph carefully while Mr.
Siyde proceeded with the business of the Court.
The reverend gentleman spent so long over the
paper that the P.M. had time to award 100 lashes
among four men, send two more to the iron-gang,
and three women to Mrs. Gordon’s Factory
(where they would be divested of the last shreds
of their virtue), before Mr. Marsden looked up.
“A very foul and scandalous attack, indeed ! ”
murmured the man of God. “You must pro-
ceed against this ruffian, Hall, Mr. Siyde. It will
never do to let him rake up old affairs after they
have been satisfactorily settled by the Govern-
ment. Let me see, you were, h’m —reprimanded,
were you not, for that affair ?
“More than that —I was punished. I was
removed from the Barrack mastership. But you
know, sir, I was young and inexperienced then.”
(Here we may parenthetically observe that Mr.
Siyde was punished. He was removed from the
Barracks— salary, £250, with quarters and servant
—but he was granted a police-magistracy—
stipend, £4OO, with quarters, fuel, and two ser-
vants. That was the way the System inflicted
punishments—upon its officials.)
“ Of course you were,” Mr. Marsden continued.
“You know I can’t approve of, h’m, these irre-
gular sexual connections, but I’m quite prepared
to make every allowance for youth and high
spirits, and I do think it is very wrong to keep
harping on old mistakes, especially after they have
been atoned for. ”
“That’s my opinion, sir, and I’m very glad to
learn it is confirmed by . ”
“ What was that last sentence, sir,” whispered
the bench-clerk ; “I didn’t quite catch the
penalty.”
“Fifty lashes—don’t interrupt, sir,” sharply
returned the P.M.
“But it’s a woman, sir,” said the clerk, aghast;
“not lashes, sir, surely ?” The System, you must
know, was becoming humane. It hadn’t flogged a
woman for five years.
“It’s a woman is it? Why didn’t you say so,
and why don’t you keep your ears open, and
what’s the case? ‘Jones, Jane, per Morley, in-
sulting behaviour,’—a week’s cells will do.’ And
then he went on with his conversation with the
saintly man.
“I was sayintr, Mr. Marsden, that I am glad to
learn you think with me that it is a shame to
throw a man’s old faults up in his face—”
The clerk interrupted again. “ Jane Jones has
a very bad record, sir. Hadn’t you better make
it a month ?”
“Yes, yes, a month’ll do —now, don’t bother
any more.”
“I did blunder, Mr. Marsden —I admit that;
but I got rid of the girls as soon as 1 could, and
married soon after.”
“Then my advice to you, my dear Mr. Siyde,
is to prosecute this man with the utmost severity
of the law. And I should go on, if I were you, as
if he had not written this libel. Never alter your
course for a libeller. To do so is to admit that
he is right and you’re wrong.
“ Thank you very much, Mr. Marsden, Pm
sure, for your kind advice. I’ll follow it. I was
thinking of giving up the temporary Barrack
mastership, but now I’m fortified by your opinion
I will not do so.”
* # #
It was peculiarly gratifying to Mr. Slycle
that he was so sustained by the Rev. Mr. Mars-
den’s judgment, for he was therefore enabled to
meet several young official bloods at the Bent-st.
Club House with a smiling face.
“ I say, Siyde, old fellow, that blackguard
Hall’s beastly about you to-day, but I hope it
woht prevent you letting us have fair play with the
lot just arrived.” Mr. Bunker, of the Commis-
sariat, was the speaker. Lunch was just over.
“I hope so too, Siyde,” said Warply, of the
Treasury ; “ I want another housekeeper badly,
my present one has taken to drink, and
Ive no comfort at all.- And if we Gov’ment
fellows don’t get first show at the new girls, we
shall be left out in the cold, as there is a deuce of
a lot of applications in for women-hand.s from
the squatting people, let me tell you.”
Yes, that there is ! ” declares young Scribbins,
a callow stripling, attached to the Colonial Secre-
tary s staff. “I had to make a schedule of them
yesterday for the chief. There are over 200
wanted, and how many’ll the ship have aboard,
Mr. Siyde ?”
Not more than 120 or 130, I should say. But,
youngster, how does the thing interest you ? You
don t want a housekeeper, surely ! ” replied Mr.
siyde.
“ Oh, but I just do ! I’m going to start a house
when I get a proper sort of woman ! ”
The room filled with the laughter of the official
group. Warphy—charming Bob Warphy with
the dash of fire-flame in his hair, and the tint of
summer skies in his eyes, and the smile of spring
sunshine in his face —the happiest, merriest soul
that ever breathed the Penal Atmosphere was
Bob Warphy ! —threw himself upon the rattan
lounge and roared till he cried.
“ 1 don’t see what you gentlemen have to laugh
about,” young Scribbins said, nettled greatly.
“No more do I, gentlemen,” said Flicker, first
draughtman of the newly-re-organised Survey
Department, and who was considered by the
best people to have rather a pretty wit. “You
misunderstood Scribbins here. It’s not really a
housekeeper he wants, but a nurse—a wet-nurse !”
Again they laughed, and the boy—he had not
yet attained legal majority—was leaving the room
in all the silly fury of the youth who is ridiculed
because he apes the man, when Slvde spoke to
him with genuine seriousness. Siyde did not
want to lose a probable client if he could help it.
“Now, Scribbins, don’t go off in a pet. If you
really want a housekeeper, I’ll try and oblige you.”
“Of course, I want one, ” snapped the youngster.
“I’m no younger than others were when they set
up one.”
“But —excuse the question, you know, we’re
all friends here —how the dickens will you
manage? You can’t pay a housekeeper’’—the
group again laughed—“on your present salary,
can you ?”
“Well, gentlemen, I don’t see how my position
concerns you.”
“Oh! but it does,” rejoined Mr. Siyde,
soothingly. “ You must know the King’s
Regulations will not permit the assignment of
convict servants to anyone of—ah, insufficient
means. And, besides —of course I speak purely as
a friend—we wouldn't like you to run into debt
and get into old Buff skin’s hands or those of anv
other Shy lock.”
For answer, young Mr. Scribbins took a chair
in his hand and, planting it so that he could face
the others, sat down the reverse way. Leaning
his arms coolly on the back, and dropping his chin
on his arms, he said :
“ I am 1 only twenty years of age, and have only
been eighteen months under the System, and am
only drawing £lO 6s. Bd. per mensem and no allow-
ances. Nevertheless, gentlemen and brother-
officials, I have learnt something. And one of the
things I have learnt, gentlemen, is this : Never to
be such a fool as to prate about the Regula-
tions to a brother-official. Cant about the Regula-
tions to outsiders and the prisoners, gentlemen, as
A NEW AUSTRALIAN GENERAL.
GERMAN VILLAGE ARISTOCRAT: “DEAR ME, VAT A CONDRY AUSTRALIA
IS, TO GET ON! MEIN SON WRITES TO ME HE HAS A POSITION
AS A GENERAL, BUT HE MUST HAVE ALTERED HIS NAME, HE
CALLS HIMSELF YON GENERAL USEFUL.”
much as you like—that’s part of the game. But
don’t cant about ’em to me. Gentlemen, wc are
the Regulations—we make ’em when we please,
we construe ’em as we please, and we don’t obey
them except when we please. Now, gentlemen,
is there anything more to say?”
He waited a half-minute, and as the stupefied
Authorities—tiiey were all more or less Authorities
—did nothing but look at one another, he resumed :
‘‘l am a young ’un, my brethren, but I know
this : there a whole heap of things done by officials
which never find their way into reports. " There’s
that little arrangement with Sam. Terry, by
which a Treasury pay-clerk pockets a ha’penny a
pound every time ten thousand pounds’ weight of
fresh beef is requisitioned from Terry ”
“Tor God’s sake ” cried Warphy, startled
off his guard.
“ I mentioned no name, Mr. Warphy,” said the
boy, looking straight into Warphy’s eyes. “Then
there’s that substituted plan which Surveyor-
General Oxley never signed, but which a depart-
mental draughtsman says is regular, though it
includes 300 acres of suburban land more than the
Suburban Grant register ”
“That volume of the register is missing!”
exclaimed Flicker, sweating with fear.
“ 1 did not say it wasn’t. But, as a matter of
fact, it is not missing. It may be missing from
the survey record, but / know where it is.”
Mr. Flicker shook with guilty tremors.
“Oh, don’t be alarmed, Flicker,” said Scribbins
patronisingly. - (Flicker was forty if he was a
day !) “I shan’t split—unless there’s occasion.”
He began again, after a pause which was very
disagreeable to every member of the official group.
There wasn’t a glimmer of a smile on a single face
now. Every one was pondering over the problem
—How much did the young cub know ? The mis-
chievous young scamp read their silence.
“You’re all wondering how much I know,
gentlemen? Never mind what I know but
you’ve all forgotten I’m precis clerk to the Colonial
Secretary. There isn’t a paper goes into him or
comes from him that I don’t see, and I have a
good memory, and I can put two and two together
and make-five! And, gentlemen, don’t you
forget it! And now, p’r’aps you won’t object to
my engaging a housekeeper if I choose to ? And
you won’t suggest a wet-nurse again, will you?
And you’ll excuse me, gentlemen, if I say that
I’ll have to be going. It’s two o’clock, and /’re no
juniors to do my work.” lie rose, and bowing,
retired. As hi? was passing from the room, lie
bethought himself, and turning called to Mr.
Slyde. “By the way, Mr. Slyde, you wont forget
to let mo know when you propose to hold your
next private auction, will you?”
Slyde nodded. When the door closed upon the
precocious Systematiser, he said.
“Well!”
“Well? I think it’s infernally ill!” groaned
Warphy. “We’ll have to get the young devil
transferred to Norfolk Island or V. D. L.”
“ him!” said Flicker, “I wish he was
burnt!”
“Same as some of these registers of yours
were, Flicker ! ” grinned Bunker of the Commis-
sariat, who, not having been exposed, thought he
could afford to laugh.
Mr. Bunker was referring to the destruction by
fire, not long before, of numerous Archives of the
Survey Branch.
Did it ever strike you, 0 honest reader, how
frequently such bonfires occurred in early Aus-
tralian history ? In Sydney, in Hobart Town, in
Auckland, in Adelaide, and in Melbourne, there
has been successive holocausts of land-records.
We don’t know about West Australia. But
there’s time enough yet for the event to be repeated
there.
Before the senior officials dispersed, Messrs.
Warphy, Flicker, and Bunker, begged Slyde not to
pay any heed to the drivel of Editor Hall.
“ Besides,” said Flicker, “you’ll have to let
that imp of mischief have his pick now !”
‘ ‘ Scragge was a fool not to follow your plan of
letting the officers have first choice,” was Mr.
Warphy’s opinion. “He offended the Establish-
ment, and didn’t placate the outsiders. Hang the
Press, say I !”
“I wish we could,” interjected Flicker. “If
we could only string up Wentworth and Wardell,
Bland and Hall, some fine Monday morning,
tliere’d be peace in the colony then.”
“ Well, gentlemen,” said Mr. Slyde, “ I’ve made
up my mind to give our friends on the staff a
choice of the new women. Not to do so would be
to admit that there’s force in that blackguard’s
scribblings, and Father Marsden urged me not to
do anything that would have the effect of admit-
ting he is right.”
“ Ah, I’m pleased old Parson’s with you. ‘ I’ve
great respect,’* as Major Anderson says, for the
old patriarch, he knows a thing or two.”
* * *
The upshot was that Mr. Slyde dropped
some score of friendly notes to as many friends in
the Establishment to notify them that a selection
of the women transports ex Augusta Jessie (2)
would be available for view before assignment at
the Barracks the next afternoon.
The vessel had been three days in the harbour
and he had already gone down and cursorily
inspected the women. As they passed in rotation
before him. he had pencil-dotted the names of
those most likely to suit the Establishment—and
himself. So, as soon as Court business was
wound up on the day he has been introduced to
to the reader, he drafted a rough list of
likelies,” and sent it to the Surgeon-Superinten-
dent of the vessel, with an instruction that the
girls should be despatched to the Barracks the
next day.
Behold, then, at four o’clock on a summer after-
noon about forty girls uniformly attired in clean
print dresses with mob-caps and whitey-brown
aprons standing in the long-room of the Barracks.
Of varying heights and contours and complexions,
they had yet one’common characteristic in addi-
tion to their common commonality. Each could
justly claim the possession of some prettiness of
form or feature. Some were truly beautiful.
At a word of command from the Matron they
formed in line and marched by twos past a range
of windows looking upon a corridor. In the pas-
sage, gazing through the windows, were some
fifteen or sixteen gentlemen of the Civil Service
and a couple of military officers.
“By George!” said one of the soldiers, “a
deuced choice bevy—fit to adorn any circle,
ha, ha !”
“ Any Court circle, you mean, Woode,’’laughed
Flicker.
“ Don’t joke, Flicker—the business is too
serious,” said Warphy. And the group laughed
more vigorously at Mr. Warphy’s sarcasm than at
Mr. Flicker’s pun.
Well, the girls passed the windows once—twice
—thrice, in couples. For a fourth time they were
sent round. This time they made the circuit in
single file, and each girl was told to walk more
slowly—“that the gem’men can size you better,
my dears,” cackled Mother Lucretia, the matron.
As each transport came towards the watchers,
Slyde’s clerk—a prisoner- writer—called out some
particulars about her.
“No. 1. Jamieson, Lucy, 19, life.” (A gipsy-
looking damsel, with a devilish glint in her bold,
black eyes.)
I’ve great respect for; you,’ as Major Anderson
says.” This saying was one of the most popular catch-
phrases of Sydney talk in the Very Early Thirties—as
popular as the “ ‘ I’ll chance it,’ as George Oakes said of
his oath,” of an earlier date. Major Anderson, of the
,50th Regiment, 'when prosecuting a capital offender, in
his capacity of Commandant at Norfolk Island, said, in
his evidence: “I have great respect for the nrisoncr,
because he told me the truth." And Sydney people
thought an expression of respect for a practically con-
demned man was so rich, that they made a joke of it.
“ Wonder what’s her crime,’’ejaculated Captain
Woode. “ Can you tell us, Slyde ?”
“Well, you know, the Home authorities don’t
send out any particulars of that kind ”
“Don’t they?” said Woode. “I didn’t know
that before. Why ?”
“ Oh, it gives the poor devils a chance out here,
so the Home people think,” sneered Slyde. “ And
that just shows what fools they are. Why,
amongst the prisoners themselves the worse the
crime the more the criminal is admired, and free
people who want servants don’t care a button
what crime their hands have committed !”
“That’s right enough where servants are con-
cerned,” commented the second military man
(Lieut. Stewart), “but the case is different with a
—a housekeeper!”
“ You wouldn’t like a murderess in your house,
you mean, Stewart. When you found her out
you’d send her off.”
“No. 5. Gurtin, Elizabeth, 21, 7 years,” called
the clerk. This girl was a beauty, and a dozen
hands jotted down her number and name in open
pocket-books. There was going to be keen com-
petition for “ Elizabeth Gurtin,” that was obvious.
She shook her head coquettishly as she neared the
window, and from beneath her hat, fell to her
waist a wealth of rippling tawny hair. And then
her great purplish eyes, deep wells of virginal in-
nocence they seemed, cast delicious glances
through each of the windows. The boy Scribbins
swore he would start housekeeping with those eyes
at the head of his table.
A slight, delicate creature with nut-brown hair,
and languorous eyes, with lips that were as bud-
ding roses, and a soft blush on rounded cheeks,
glided up as “No. 17; Lodge, Rosaline, 18,14
years ” was called out. Once more there were
rapid pencilling which foretold some active bid-
ding for the little beauty.
“Slyde,” said Woode, “ find out what her crime
is, will you, that’s a good fellow.”
“She won't suit you, Woode,” said Slyde.
“She’s a nurse-girl, and you’re not married. ”
Woode turned and scanned the group of officials.
Taking a handful of coin from his pocket, he said :
“ I’ll wager anyone five pounds to a dollar that,
barring Slyde, no one here is married, and I’ll
wager another five pounds that if I obtain this
girl’s assignment to me it will not be the first time
by a score that single men have been the assignees
of nurse-girls before now.”
No one took the wagers. And the procession
went on to its finish.
# # #
“Now, gentlemen,” said Mr. Slyde as he took
the chair ten minutes later at the head of the table
in his own office, “Let’s to business!” You all
know the terms and conditions ? The lots will be
put up one by one. The bidder of the highest
premiums will have the lot knocked down to him.
Gentlemen in authority now present agree to
facilitate the routine of formal assignment of the
transport to the highest bidder, in due course and
premiums to be devoted, gentlemen, to the sacred
cause of charity !” A smile from every one ! The
Charity invariably was a tip-top spread for the
patrons of the auction, at Mr. Walker’s famed
Parramatta hostelry!
“Lucy Jameson, gentlemen,” called Slyde,
(the clerk was shut out of these proceeding), “a
brilliant brunette, buxom, with a duck of a waist,
but a devil of a temper if her eyes speak truly.”
“ I’d risk her temper,” said Lieutenant Stewart.
“ I rather like a bit of a vixen—but I’d like to
know her crime. ”
Slyde touched a bell. His clerk came in.
“ Find out what Lucy Jamieson, lifer, was con-
victed for ?”
In two minutes the clerk was back. “ Murder,
she says, sir. Killed her lover because he struck
her. Condemned to death, reprieved and com-
muted to transportation for life.”
“ Ah, thanks !” said Stewart.
And Lucy Jamieson was passed in. Lieutenant
Stewart’s admiration for spirit didn’t go so far as
her engagement.
* * *
“Elizabeth Gurtin, that upstanding
blonde, gentlemen ! Genuine auburn hair, gen-
tlemen—no, not hair, hair’s commonplace; tresses,
gentlemen, tresses such as poets rave about—
genuine gold. What bids, sirs, what bids ? Why,
gents all, if the witch plays up, there’s a ten-
pound note in that hair alone ! Bring her to me,
and I’ll have her shaved, and you’ll get ten golden
sovereigns for those auburn tresses as sure as my
name’s Slyde !”
A Babel of biddings ! A dozen voices called
“One pound!” “Thirty shillings!” “Two
pounds!”
Lip the price went, “ Two, five ! M “ Two
ten ! ”
“ The auburn tresses,” renlinded Slyde.
“ Two fifteen ! ” “ Three pounds ! ”
“ Her magnificent eyes and statuesque bust,
gentlemen! ” called Slyde. And the figures
ascended, spurred to unprecedented heights by
Mr. Slyde’s recital of charms.
At five pounds, rose Mr. Scribbins from his
chair.
“Gentlemen,” he said, “I’m going to start
housekeeping, and I want this girl as housekeeper
and Fm going to have her. Those gentlemen who
were present at the Club yesterday will under-
stand why I don’t wish opposition from them.
And those who were not, had better be informed
of what I mean by those who were there.”
# * #
And so Elizabeth Gurtin, aged 21, became
the assigned servant (“ housekeeper,” the Gazette
notice ran) of George S. Scribbins, Esq., Clerk in
the Colonel Secretary’s Department.
Rosaline Lodge—perhaps the prettiest case of
infanticide ever landed in Sydney—was knocked
down (“as a nurse girl ”) to Captain Woode. Slyde
ran her up to three fifteen, his limit, but lost her.
And took revenge upon himself by eating every
fragment of finger-nail get-at-able by his teeth.
* * #
It may appear strange that a boy, drawing
a salary of £lO monthly (without allowances),
should be able to start housekeeping with a golden-
haired beauty.
The strangeness may possibly be forgotten when
we state that Mr. George S. Scribbins was the
master of two other assigned servants —one, the
expertest engrossing clerk in Sydney, and the
second, a capital carpenter. The former earned
about five pounds per week and the latter four.
Of the sum of nine pounds thus earned, the
System generously consented to the workers
retaining four pounds between them, and gave
Mr. George S. Scribbins the balance.
When, in due course, the golden-haired house-
keeper visited Parramatta Factory for a certain
purpose, the Rev. Mr. Marsden admonished her

There is something to consider in the daily ex-
penses for the household necessities, which in the
aggregate of the year account to a good deal. I ho
ethics of buying and selling appear to be for the
vendor to get all he can, and for the purchaser to
see that he don’t get too much. But what is too
much ? It is almost a profound question, and
] (resents the strange paradox that the dearest m
many tilings is often the cheapest. Certainly this
is so in food, when health is involved, and m
remedies which restore health after it has been
impaired. It is certainly so in clothing; for a
cheap suit that will hardly last one is dearer than
t he one which will last two seasons, the difference
in price being reasonable. So in shoes and the
lik ". Recurring to the items of food and health,
undoubtedly the most important, it is found that
villainous adulteration is what renders cheaper
much that is sold, and men are known to
have spent thousands to be cured of disease, have
suffered years of agony, and have trifled away
their substance on worthless remedies, flhat
which is testified to by thousands as being an
absolute cure, and permanently efficacious, is
cheap at any price in comparison with such as
have no virtue, and which prolong suffering. A
case in point is the following: “New Bloom-
field, Pa., April 26, 1886. The Charles A. Vogeler
Co., Baltimore, Md. Gentlemen, —For more
than thirty years I had been afflicted with rheu-
matism so severe I had to use morphine to secure
rest at night. Spent hundreds of dollars with
physicians and for remedies without benefit,
l'ive years ago .1 tried St. .Jacobs Oil, and it
effected an entire and permanent cure. 1 have
not been troubled with it since. Cold or damp
weather does not affect me at all. 1 desire to
give it my unqualified endorsement. —.J. E. Bon-
sai.!,, clerk of the several Courts of Perry County,
Pa.” The point here is not so much what Mr.
Bonsall paid for the great remedy for pain, for
the price is a mere bagatelle, but that he was
permanently cured after 30 years’ suffering. Of
course the poor must count the cost in every thing :
but they should reckon on the sound basis that
that which is bad is worthless, and that which is
the best and will cure, and stay cured, is cheap at
any price.

DISASTROUS LOSSES.
By recent advices from South Australia we are
informed that, under date of 13th October, Mr.
It. O. Merrett, of North Creek, Warrina, writes
as follows to Messrs. A. W. Dobbie and Co., of
Adelaide, which is sure to prove of interest to a
large number of our readers : “ Dear sir,—I am
writing to tell you about a Waterbury Watch that
I had in use for about twelve months. I lost it in
the water on Easter Monday last when there was
a very big flood here, and it was found again on
the 1st of October, about three inches deep, in the
ground. When I got it I wound it up and it has
been going ever since, and keeping splendid time,
so I thought that I would let you know, as it may
be something in favor of the watches. I here are
any amount of people about here that know this
for a fact. If you would like to see the watch let
me know, and I will send it down to you.”
AT A TRIFLING COST
you can obtain a Waterbury Watch, which rarely
gets out of order, and never constitues itself a
permanent tax on the owner. In the event of
injury befalling it, by taking or sending it to the
Company's Repair Depot, 56, Margaret-street, it
can be efficiently repaired at a nominal cost,
ranging according to the extent of damage, from
Gd to 2s 6d, but never exceeding the latter amount
unless by mutual consent.
The genuine Waterbury may be obtained from
any respectable storekeeper or dealer. Price,
series “ E ” (the old favourite), 13s. 6d. ; series
“J”or“L”(the new marvels), with enamelled
dials, 22s. Gd. each.
CAUTION. — Intending purchasers of the
genuine article should note that all watches manu-
factured by the Waterbury Watch Co. have the
word “ WATERBURY ” printed in fine type on
the dial-face, and also the interlaced letters
“ W.W.Co.,” without which none are genuine.

From the (Maoriland) election address of
our esteemed contributor, Mr. W. J. Howlett: —
Fellow Electors,— lt is just three years and three
months since I last issued an address similar to this. On
that occasion I merely offered to go to the poll if you
wished me to. 1 now' repeat the offer. If you have as
much brains as I should like every man who votes for me
to possess, you will first ask me : Why l want to get into
the House. Mv reply is that lam fond of getting behind
the scenes. To regard the position of M.H.R. as an
honour is absurd. A man is judged by his company, and
asan ordinary member I should lose caste. 1 should,
however, like Very well to find out why such a number of
seedy, oilt-at-elbows people hustle to get in. Whose
pockets do they get their fingers in ? How' are the steals
arranged? You may be sure that the red-nosed men in
patched hoots and doubtful linen are not there for the
honorarium, much less for the honor and glory : they have
their axes to grind, and when I find out I will let you know.
Please understand, also, that I am asking no favour at
your hands. You want responsible and onerous work
done, and nobody who knows me doubts my capacity to
do it.. Now I can’t, deny that I would get a, quid pro quo
in the shape of knowledge. I could pick up a lot of
experience in the House, and would not refuse to serve if
elected. 1 should have access to a few men who really
know something, and in exchange for the opportunity of
learning I offer my services. The honorarium is to me a
minus quantity. It would cost more than £2OO to leave
my home for three months, and it is doubtful how long I
should stay in the House, as it is my peculiar task to
ferret out abuses, abolish incompetent officials, and deny
all received opinions. This would expose me to such a
torrent of abuse and mudpelting, that, as likely as
not, I should throw up the sponge after a few years.
Etcetera, &c.
Here is a bright and thrilling American
horror of the Even Noose type. The author’s
tendencies to adhere to fact amounts to a disease,
and his statements are backed up and endorsed by
two book-canvassers and a sewing-machine agent:
At 4 o’clock one morning last week a negro named
Schofield Gantt, alias Merritt, was killed oh the Rich-
mond and Danville track in the southern part of Green-
boro, N.C. He stepped off the main line out of the way
of a train on a side-track directly in front of a backing
engine. He was knocked down and run over. His body
was cut almost immediately in two at the waist, only a
shred of muscle holding the two parts together. The
wheels of two cars and a tender passed over him, yet
when the train stopped he told the hands how to take
him out. He was laid on a skid and lived and talked
calmly and rationally of his injuries for an hour. Occa-
sionally he would glance at. the parts of his body laying
around. The first of his relatives to reach him was his
aged grandmother, who dropped dead after looking upon
His injuries.
The Bulletin desires to lend its personal support
to the above statements. We were intimately
acquainted at one time with a man in Queensland
who had the whole of his vitals scooped out by a
ditching machine, and he lived for nearly three
weeks with his internal organs lying on a shovel
by his bedside. He also talked rationally and
calmly about his injuries, and in addition he wrote
a Iqng poem, and contributed two or three articles
to the Rockhampton Capricornian in his last
moments, and nearly finished an exhaustive
treatise on the specific gravity of the planet
Jupiter. The manuscript of this is still in our
possession. The patient in this case was married,
and had eleven children, and about eighteen
brothers, uncles, cousins, and other relations, and
they all fell down dead when they saw him. At
one time it was even hoped that the sufferer might
recover, but unhappily lie was seized with con-
vulsions, and after swallowing himself and spitting
himself out several times, he heaved a long sigh
and died. These statements will be corroborated
by the local clerk of petty sessions, and will be
duly substantiated by the pound-keeper.

“ A prize-fight for £lO a-side was fought
yesterday near Leeds, between Kelly, of Leeds,
and Grady, of Nottingham. The encounter was
of a most desperate encounter, 72 rounds being
fought. The contest resulted in a victory for
Kelly, his opponent being removed from the ring
totally blinded by the punishment he had re‘
ceived.”— Cable.
O, Slav in, Jackson, Goddard—chief among the
fighting-cocks
You are fond of safety-matches, striking only on
the box,
And the world turns pale if either of your nasal
organs bleeds—
Now, what is your opinion of that merry mill at
Leeds?
Can you understand the conduct of these two
plebeian pugs.,
Whose appetite for slaughter is as keen as any
Thug’s ? .
And does it seem respectable, O, bruisers of
renown,
’ To fight a round with knuckles for a paltry half-
a-crown
O, Jackson, Goddard, Slavin, six-feet something
in your shoes,
At the end of “ splendid contests ” you can barely
show a bruise,
But trip away to supper, looking affable and cool,
While grinning biz’ness managers are totting up
the pool.
And the simpletons who parted twenty-shillings
for a seat
To gaze upon two objects that 11 have never known
defeat,”
Go home and tell their kindred of the smashing
blows they saw
Whi.ch very nearly landed on the other fellow s
jaw.
O, Goddard, Slavin, Jackson, sure the rhymester,
as he reads
How Kelly blinded Grady in the neighbourhood
of Leeds,
After many hours of punching for so very small a
stake,
Is disgusted at the error which these common
scrappers make.
If they mean to fight as Sayers fought, or even
Mace and King,
There’s an end of earning thousands by gavotting
round a ring,
With a little crowd of peelers in attendance to
avert
The chance of either hero getting seriously hurt.
O, Slavin, Jackson, Goddard, giants gentle as the
doves,
Let “ science ” be your motto, and stick ever to the
gloves ;
Then you’ll live a trifle longer than these duffers,
we’ll be bound,
Who have knocked each other silly, at one half-a-
erown' a round.
* (Seventy-two rounds for £lO gives an average of some-
thing over 2s. 9d. per round.)

Put out your fires and go to bed,
Is what the voice of Labour said.
The good old times have gone away,

And seek repose just when you please,
Such seems to be the latest rule
That is in vogue in Labour school.

And have your bottle of St. Louis beer.

And drink Sarsaparilla and Ironwater.

dissecting-room, which had most shocked me when
f had been newer to my work, and to which I had
lone since become easily accustomed recurred to
me now with a freshness of horror which literal y
fvmened me. There are times when to bully
Ss nervesls the worst possible policy I recog-
• Ji rtfis as one of them, and closed my pro-
fessional studies for the night. I took a book at
Card from the shelf, and it proved to be a
h nlnme of the “Causes Celebres,” and opened
naturally at the trial of the Marquise de Brin-
viUiers, and at a peculiarly ghastly woocicut repre-
cnniint? the unfortunate woman s last toilet. I
flung it aside, glad to find that I still had enough
snirits left to laugh at this shadowy obsession of
horror, and determined to go to bed.
I went to bed, and lay and tossed and tumbled
and stared at the thick curtain of darkness which
served as a background for all the horrible scenes
of torture, mutilation and carnage my reading and
imagination between them could conjure up for
mv discomfort. To say that at last I felt
frightened at this ghastly panorama would be to
do myself an injustice, but I did get a little
frightened at myself. I was, and am, as little in-
clined to morbid ideas as any man alive, and to
find myself thus twitching all over with purely
imaginary fears which my judgment mocked and
vet could not banish; Was disquieting. I settled
that I had been overworking myself, and that my
nerves were taking this fashion of teaching me to
respect them. -I had always found healthy
bodily fatigue the best medicine msuch cases, and
thought I would try it now. Sleep was obviously
out of the question. I got up, dressed, put on a
heavy overcoat and muffler—it was bitter winter
weather-and stole out. My rooms were on the
ground-floor, and occupied its whole space except
for the chamber in which my landlord slept. I
dosed the front door very softly, so as not to
awake him, and found myself in the street.
There were already two or three inohes of snow
upon the ground, and more was coming down, in
heavy, straight-ruled lines. The weather and the
lateness of the hour had almost cleared the
streets, and but few passengers were about. The
few snow-whitened figures I met went past me
silently, their footsteps evoking no echo from the
muffled stones, like the unquestioned ghosts with
whom Ulysses met in his infernal voyage. I was
more alone in the white solitude of the streets
than I had been in my lonely chambers. A dead
London, with the folds of a spotless winding sheet
falling inexorably over it. But the healthy
motion, and the fresh air, and the cold fingers of
the snow upon my face had done me good, and
chased from my brain the disquieting shadows
which had filled it for the last few hours, before I
had walked a mile.
At the street corner, scarcely a hundred yards
from my door, I had been dimly conscious of the
figure of a woman standing under the light of a
lamp. The snow fell so thickly that in passing
her at a rapid rate I had caught but the merest
glimpse. The attitude in which she stood dwelt
in my mind as one of profound dejection. Bor a
moment I had thought of accosting her, and offer-
ing her money wherewith to procure a shelter, and
as I walked on I was ashamed to think that it
was merely the prospect of the trouble of taking
off my glove, unbuttoning my wraps, and finding
the necessary coin, which had deterred me from
that act of charity. Surely, but a little trouble
to take, and what a word of sympathy or the gift
of a shilling to a homeless wanderer on such a
night as this might do, what misery it might
avert, who could know ? That misty figure at the
street corner bade fair to become as big a burden
as the even mistier figures which had tormented
me so long already, but I resolutely banished it,
and marched on triumphant.
The snow was getting too thick underfoot for
pleasant walking, and at last I turned homewards
again. As I passed the lamp beside which the
.figure had stood I glanced towards it. With little
enough expectation of seeing it still there, you
may believe, but —there it was ! Not a line of it's
attitude seemed changed. The poor, thin dress,
heavily clogged with snow, might have solidified
to marble, so perfectly did its every curve recall
the details of that indistinctly-seen vision of an
hour ago.
I stood looking at the woman for a minute or
two across that changing, glittering veil of snow,
and she, unconscious of my neighbourhood, stood
still with one thinly-covered arm, thick with the
white flakes, embracing the lamp. I moved
closer, and still she took no heed of me, and it
was not until I touched her on the shoulder that
she turned.
“ What are you doing here ?” I asked.
“What should I be doing?” she asked in re-
turn.
“ Have you no home to go to ?”
She answered by a repetition of the word and a
husky laugh. It changed to a racking cough,
which so shook her that the heavy wreaths of
snow fell from her dress in a little storm. Her
face was blue with cold, and pinched with hunger,
and as her wasted fingers clutched at her neck
they might have been the talons of a bird of prey,
they were so lean with famine. The paroxysm
passed and left her panting weakly for her breath,
leaning against the lamp, and feebly beating her
hollow bosom with a wasted hand.
“You are too ill,” I said, “to be abroad on a
night like this. You should be in the hospital.”
“ I left it only last week,” she answered.
“ Take my advioe and go back to-morrow.”
“They oan’t do me any good,” she answered.
“ I’m booked for the journey through. It won’t
take long, thank God.”
There was no reckless bravado, such as is so
common with women of her class, but an awful
truth in those last words.
I hardly knew what to do. To leave her with
a mere gift of money to face the long hours of cold
and hunger before day should break seemed but
a poor, perfunctory charity. It was so late that
even the lowest lodging-houses would be closed.
There was a decency about her, even in her degra-
dation, which touched me. The wretched dress
she wore was as neat as her poor means could
make it. There was a faint echo of good breeding
in her hoarse vo'ce. The famine-pinched features,
blue with cold, had been delicately pretty once,
perhaps not so long ago, for she could not be more
than thirty.
I reflected that I was near home, that I had left
all the house asleep, that there would still be some
fire in my sitting-room. It would be quite safe
and easy to take the poor waif in for a few hours
and let her go at daybreak, saved at least from
those long, crawling hours of cold and hunger in
the waste desert of the snow-clad streets.
“Follow me,” I said.
She drew her skimp shawl about her shoulders,
and we walked silently to my door. A lowered
gas-jet was burning in the hall, and the house was
as silent as the street we had quitted. “Step
lightly,” I whispered. The door of the sitting-
room jarred and creaked with a noise which
sounded tremendous in the dead silence. The
woman flitted past me, and made for the red gleam
of the decaying fire as an animal, dying of thirst,
might make for a brook. As I moved about the
room, turning up the gas, and throwing more coals
upon the fire, she looked up at me, from time to
time, like a sleep-walker on the verge of waking.
She was so covetous of the heat that I thought
more than once that she would thrust her
shrivelled fingers amid the burning embers.
There were meat and wine in the cheffonier, and
while she was still crouching about the fire I
brought them out and set them on the table.
“ Are you hungry ? ” I asked her.
She started up, and her glance fell on the viands.
She was so ravenous that she clutched the meat in
her fingers, and tore at it, looking at me mean-
while. I have seen exactly such a look in the eyes
of a famished dog which had snatched a bone from
roff a heap of offal in the street. Outside, her
bearing had shown the placid patience which
. comes of complete despair. Now, this bare gleam
of bohifort, this mere taste of the means of life, had
made a savage of her. She would have fought for
the meat she worried, like that dog.
-• She ate, with animal noises of enjoyment, until
she could eat no more. At a mere hint from me
that such excess after long fasting would be dan-
gerous, she had answered with a wordless snarl,
just as the dog would have done at any attempt
to deprive him of his bone. The exercise and
relish of eating had so absorbed her that she had
taken no heed of the wine, but she clutched it now
and drank it as greedily as she had devoured the
meat.
Her meal finished, she seemed a little ashamed
of her voracity, and stood looking, half sullenly,
at the fire.
“You don’t mind me having a bit of a warm
before I go, I suppose?” she said presently.
“You need not go at all yet,” I answered.
“ You can stay here until daybreak.”
I pushed the sofa to the fire and threw a travel-
ling-rug upon it.
“Don’t be afraid to go to sleep. I will sit up
and wake you when it is time to go.”
“You’re a good sort,” she said, looking at me
again. “ You’re not a clergyman ?”
“No,” I said, “I am a doctor.”
“You’re a good sort,” she said agam, “what-
ever you are. If there were more of your kind,
perhaps there might be fewer of mine. “ Hush!”
she cried, suddenly. “What’s that?”
A step sounded outside, and a second later
came a heavy summons at the door.
“ Who’s there?” I cried.
“Me,” answered a deep voice, which I recog-
nised as my landlord’s. “You’ve got a woman
there !”
The girl was clinging to me, white with terror.
Even at that moment it struck me that her fear
was disproportionate to its cause. The worst that
could happen to her, since she was there by my in-
vitation, was to be turned into the street whence
I had brought her, and she was a hundred times
better fitted to stand the exposure after the meal
she had eaten. It was a white enough lie,
Heaven knows, and only spoken to shield the poor
thing. I answered, saying that I was alone.
“That’s a lie!” answered the landlord, bluffly.
“ I heard two voices, and the other wasawoman’s.
Open the door. ”
“Go to the devil!” I answered, angered by the
man’s persistence.
“ Open the door,” he repeated, shaking thelock,
“ or I’ll break it open.”
The girl was clinging to me in a very ecstasy of
terror. The landlord, receiving no answer to his
last summons, set his shoulder to the door—he was
a giant in weight and strength—and the lock
yielded as if it had been of cardboard.
“I’ll teach you to defile my house with this
kind of vermin,” he began.
The girl, with one arm before her eyes, still
clung to me with the other, but with a failing
grasp. He drew her roughly away, but in the
very act fell back a step with a sudden cry.
• • ‘ Mary ! Great God ! ”
“Father!”
She stretched her hands towards him with an
imploring gesture as he gazed at her. His be-
wilderment lasted scarcely a second. He pointed
to the door. She obeyed the gesture, and he fol-
lowed her from the room, with no further word
from me. I heard the girl’s imploring voice for a
minute, suddenly cut short by his gruff tones.
Then the front door opened and closed, and all
was still again.
I left the house that day, and have never seen
or heard of father or daughter since.— Hawk.

Was His Marriage a Failure?
The first time I met young Culbertson was on a
ladies’ day last spring, in one of the card-rooms of
the Social Art Club. I got a whiff of smoke from
the cigar he was puffing. The aroma was delight-
ful, and the impression that it made upon me was
that Culbertson was a man of educated and some-
what extravagant tastes, though not of sufficient
means always to gratify them. I became in-
terested in him; and my interest was repaid, not
only by the discovery that my first impression was
correct, but that his was a most unique character.
In due time we became quite intimate, and the
intimacy, while increasing my interest, at the
same time filled me with a sincere regard for the
young fellow. Commercially, I found him to be
in a moderately prosperous business; morally, I
found him to be a modern Joseph—staunch in his
virtue; though beset on all hands by temptation,
before which a less sturdy character must have
fallen prone. .
He was a puzzle to me, which at times 1 gave
up all hope of solving. Now gay, frivolous, light-
hearted, he would suddenly become sober, solemn,
and morose, and the metamorphosis was nearly
always without apparent reason. All efforts to
draw from him the cause were gently but firmly
repulsed. On other occasions, he would leave me
suddenly, and dart off almost without a word, to
be gone sometimes two or three days.
I remember an instance last summer, while we
were spending a fortnight at the seaside. The
morning was hot and stifling. The wind had been
from off shore for several days, and the sun had
shrivelled the flowers in the beds on the hotel
lawns, and so baked the drives as to keep the
watering carts incessantly busy laying the dust.
Suddenly Culbertson looked up from his paper.
“Egad!” he exclaimed, “it is the 10th of
August, isn’t it? I had almost forgotten.’
Then he disappeared into the house, and half-an-
hour after I saw him jump into the coach that was
about starting for the train bound cityward.
Pn August 14th he was back again.
“How did you enjoy your city-trip?” I
He*looked hurt by the question, but did not
seem surprised. , T < ~,
“ It was on business, not pleasure, that I went!
he answered curtly, and he was gloomy for two
days afterwards. . .
I met Culbertson the other evening in the
theatre vestibule.
“lam tired of it,” he said, let us stroll up to
the hotel and have some wine.”
There was not a vacant place in the cafe, so we
went into the ladies’ supper-room. We had not
been seated long before an elderly gentleman, a,
distinguished-looking man, with white beard and
moustache of military cut, followed by a young
woman, whose beauty attracted me on the instant,
came in and took seats at a table just opposite us.
The woman was quite fair, and her figure, which
was well displayed by a costume of most admir-
able fit, was simply ravishing in its plump
roundness. . .
When at length I turned my admiring gaze
from her to Culbertson, I found an unaccount-
able change had come over him.
He was frowning ominously. His cheeks were
flushed, and his teeth had left their marks in his
lower lip. T ....
“ I say, old man ! ” I exclaimed in surprise,
“ what’s come over you? You look as mad as a
hatter.”
My friend made no reply for an instant, but
fleoked a orumb from the tablecloth with his
napkin. Then he poured some wine into a glass
and drank it off thirstily.
“Not now !” he answered at length, “ not now !
Later I may tell you all.” -
Several times I noted that he cast rapid glances
at the woman I had noticed, and I also observed
that she occasionally looked furtively at him.
“ Can it be that they are acquainted ? ” I asked
myself, but after due consideration I put away
such an idea, as too improbable to build upon.
Culbertson was unusually quiet throughout our
stay at the hotel, and not until he had lighted
a cigar and we were well out on the street, did he
volunteer a remark.
“ Did you see the fair woman in the beaded
opera cloak, with white feather trimming ? ’’ he
asked at length, taking long pulls at his cigar
between every other word.
“ Yes,” I replied, “ I saw there was a person of
that description in the room.”
“Do you know who she is?” he asked again.
I confessed that I did not.
“ She is my wife!”
The words fell upon my hearing like a thunder-
bolt. Up to that moment, well as I knew Culbert-
son, I never suspected that he was married, or had
ever had a romance.
“ Was your wife, you mean !” I suggested when
I had recovered from the staggering blow he had
dealt me. “You are divorced ? ”
“ Divorced !” he said, somewhat fiercely. “ No,
sir ; I am not divorced. I pray heaven, I never
shall be. It is not because that old man—deyil
that he is—has not worked hard to accomplish it,
but he has failed, failed signally at every point,
and his daughter is still.my wife.”
Again he was silent for a while. His feelings
had evidently got the better of him for a moment,
and he would not trust himself to go on.
It was in quite a retired nook of the Social Art
Club that he told me his story at last, when the
evening was wearing apace, and when the noisy
boys who frequent the place in the wee sma’ hours
before dawn had departed.
He had come to the city when eighteen years
old, he said—he is now twenty-three—and had
secured a place at a small salary in Campbell’s
paper warehouse. Mr. Campbell had been a
friend of his father’s friend and was very kind to
him. He was a poor youth, and his. weekly
stipend being scarcely sufficient to pay his board
and clothe him, Mr. Campbell generously offered
him a home in his own stately mansion.
Mr. Campbell’s daughter, Clarice, was just
budding into womanhood then, and young Cul-
bertson would have been less than flesh and blood
had he not fallen in love with her. He did fall,
he told me—fell madly, passionately, absorbingly
in love. Clarice filled his every thought, made
him unfit for business, and fired his passion to a
pitch that was maddening. The usual result fol-
lowed. They were secretly married, and when
Mr. Campbell found it out, Culbertson was igno-
miniously dismissed from the Campbell home,
and deposed from his position in the paper ware-
house.
“ Then,” he said, to use his own words, “ I fell
into luck. An old college chum turned up who
befriended me. He gave me a lift, and 1 was soon
in a way to make a respectable income, but old
Campbell would not relent. 1 had deceived him,
he said, and under no circumstances should I have
the wife I had won. As for her, her paternal love
was great—she adored her father. She was his
only child. Mrs. Campbell had died years before,
and, muoh as I pleaded with her, she would not
leave him. Her father’s word was law, and what
he bade her do was with her second nature. Then
the old man tried to secure a divoroe for his
daughter, but I got down to his methods, and I
have outwitted him.
“ What I tell you now will explain, I imagine,
many things which have puzzled you. In the
first place, he thought to force me into making
application for a separation. Clarice was very
S;ay for a while. She flirted with men of acknow-
edged loose reputations, men whose breath was
pollution, whose company was equal to social
ostracism. I watched her carefully. I found she
took no pleasure in her folly. She was acting
under orders; and I knew she would go so far and
no further. I declined to seek a divorce. Then
I found that my footsteps were being dogged.
They have been dogged from that day to this by
paid detectives in the hope that I should fall into
the snares of fair women that have been laid
for me. Thank God, I have avoided all such pit-
falls.”
“But the desertion plea,” I suggested, “ surely
that is open to them now.”
“ No,” he answered, “ you are wrong. I have
made it a point to visit the Campbells regmlarly.
On the twelfth day of each month I call upon my
wife, present my card, and beg an audience. lam
invariably refused.”
“ But she could surely secure a divorce on the
ground of non-support ?” I ventured again.
“ Even that loophole is closed to her, or, rather,
to him,” Culbertson answered, as he knocked the
ashes from his cigar. “Every month, with the
regularity of clock-work, I send to my wife a
cheque for £2O, and it is just as regularly returned
to me. My dear friend, I have made this matter
a study, and the sharpest lawyers have been
unable to outwit me. By no possible technicality
can these bonds be broken. Campbell will die
some day, and the moment his breath leaves his
body, Clarice will send for me. That she has
promised, and, contradictory as it may seem, in
view of her present attitude, I am assured that it
will be the happiest moment of her life when she
can write that one word ‘ Come!’ ”
Is it for love or money that young Culbertson is
playing ? That is the only puzzle that remains to
me in this curious character study.—Ex.
Wolf e’s Schnapps—a mild stimulant.
A once rabid French Royalist writes :
We can do without a king all that the French people
formerly thought could only be done with one. We have
put down a formidable insurrection ; we have maintained
constantly complete order in the streets of Paris ; Paris
for more than fifteen years has not lifted a hit of pave-
ment or heard a gun fired. We have borrowed milliards,
and we have found creditors to trust us ; we have several
times reduced the interest on our loans, and the creditor
has given his consent; we have signed treaties ;we have
conquered provinces and empires: we have fought naval
battles ; we have formed armies and reconstructed our
military system ; we have made and unmade several times
our system of public instruction ; we have opened uni-
versal exhibitions; we have invited Europe to our fetes,
she has come to them, and found them as dazzling as
those given by Louis XIV. at Versailles. We do not
decide whether all this has been always done at the right
time and in the best way possible. We say, and it. is
demonstrated, that our Governments have done, and can
do, with Republican institutions all that it is the office of
a Government to do. This being so, what is the good of
a king ? What should we do with a king ? Besides,
whence should we choose this king ? The French people
has only now to he a king itself.

The latest American romance Entering
a railway-carriage on a bridal tour, the Chicagoan
blushing bride saw, with consternation, the nan
from whom she was last divorced. Her new hus
band had just also recognised him, having seen
his photograph, when the lady by whom the cast
off hubby was accompanied, turned away from the
window out of which she gazed, and the fresh one
saw that it was a former wife of his own. He began
to think that things were mixed and that it was
time to go, when his ex-wife leaned across the
aisle to him and smiled sweetly. “ How do you
do, George ?” she said. “ Congratulate me; I have
just been married.” “It is a coincidence,” he
answered, smiling. “So have I.” “Really i” she
cried. “ Present me.” In a moment the four people
were chatting together as agreeably as possible
“ But where are you going ?” one of them asked at
length. “ Oh, we are going to So-and-So.”
“Then why don’t we all go there and make a
comfortable little family party?” The suggestion
was received with acclamation, and it was on the
spot decided that the four should pass the honey-
moon together. They did, and things became
still more mixed, and the air is now thick with
divorce suits. George is accused of flirting with
his first wife, while she charges the third wife of
George of alienating the affections of her second
husband, who brought matters to a head by
eloping with his first divorced wife, who aban-
doned her two young families for the purpose.

What folly it would be to cut grass with a pair of scissors! Yet peo-
ple do equally silly things every day. Modern progress has grown up
from the hooked sickle to the swinging scythe and thence to the lawn
mower. So don’t use scissors!
But do you use SAPOLIO ? If you don’t you are as much behind the
age as if you cut grass with a dinner knife. Once there were no soaps.
Then one soap served all purposes. Now the sensible folks use one soap
in the toilet, another in the tub, one soap in the stables, and SAPOLIO
for all scouring and house-cleaning.

Happiness.
“What Matter! She was Happy.”
It was tea-time, before the appearance of the
lamps. The villa commanded the sea; the sun,
which had disappeared, had left the sky all rosy
from his passing—rubbed, as it were, with gold-
dust; and the Mediterranean, without a ripple,
without a shudder, smooth, still shining under the
dying day, seemed like a huge and polished metal
plate.
Far off to the right the jagged mountains out-
lined their black profile on the paled purple of the
West.
We talked of love, we discussed that old subject,
we said again the things which we had said already
very often. The sweet melancholy of the twilight
made our words slower, caused a tenderness to
waver in our souls; and that word “love,” which
came back ceaselessly, now pronounced by a strong
man’s voice, now uttered by the frail-toned sweet
voice of a woman, seemed to fill the little salon,
to flutter there like a bird, to hover there like a
spirit.
Can one remain in love for years in succession ?
“ Yes,” maintained some.
“No,” affirmed others.
We distinguished cases, we established limita-
tion ■, we cited examples ; and all, men and women,
filled with rising and troubling memories, which
they could not quote, and which mounted to their
lips, seemed moved, and talked of that common,
that sovereign thing, the tender and mysterious
union of two beings, with a profound emotion and
an ardent interest.
But, all of a sudden, some one, whose eyes had
been fixed upon the distance, cried out:
“ Oh ! Look down there ; what is it?”
On the sea, at the bottom of the horizon, loomed
up a mass—grey, enormous, and confused.
The women had risen from their seats, and,
without understanding, looked at this surprising
thing which they had never seen before.
Some one said :
“ It is Corsica ! You see it so two or three times
a year, in certain exceptional conditions of the
atmosphere, when the air is perfectly clear, and it
is not concealed by those heavy mists of sea-fog
which always veil the distance.”
We distinguished vaguely the mountain ridges ;
we thought we recognised the snow on their sum-
mits. And everyone remained surprised, troubled,
almost terrified, by this sudden apparition of a
world, by this phantom risen from the sea. Maybe
that those wiio, like Columbus, went away across
undiscovered oceans had such strange visions as
this.
Th m said an old gentleman who had not yet
spoke.i :
“Sje here : I knew in that island which rai-ed
itself before us, as if in person to answer what we
said, and to recall to me a singular memory—l
knew, I say, an admirable case of love which was
true, of love which, improbably enough, was
happy. Here it is :
“ Five yeai’s ago I made a journey to Corsica.
That savage island is more unknown and more
distant from us than America, even though you
see it sometimes from the very coasts of France, as
we have done to-day.
“ Imagine a world which is still chaos, imagine
a storm of mountains separated by narrow ravines
where torrents roll ; not a single plain, but
immense waves of granite and giant undu ations
of earth covered witli brushwood or with high
forests of chestnut trees and pines. It is a virgin
soil, uncultivated, desert, although you sometimes
make out a village, like a heap of rocks, on the
summit of a mountain. No culture, no indus-
tries, no art. One never meets here with a-morsel
of carved wood, ora bit of sculptured stone, never
the least reminder that the ancestors* of these
p iople had .any taste, whether rude or refined, for
gracious and beautiful things. It is this which
strikes you the most in their superb and hard
country: their indifference to that search for
seductive forms which is called Art.
“ Italy, where every palace, full of masterpieces,
is a masterpiece itself; Italy, where marble, wood,
bronze, iron, metals, and precious stones attest
man’s genius, where the smallest old things which
lie about in the ancient houses reveal that divine
care for grace —Italy is for us the sacred country
we love, because she shows us and proves to us
the struggle, the grandeur, the power and the
triumph of the intelligence which creates.
“And, face to face with her, the savage Corsica
has remained exactly as in her earliest days. A
man lives there in his rude house, indifferent to
everything which does not concern his o an bare
existence or bis family feuds. And lie lias re-
tained the vices and the virtues of sa-age races ;
he. is violent, malignant, sanguinary without a
thought of remorse, but also hospitable, generous,
devoted, simple, opening his door to passers by,
and giving freely his faithful friendship in return
for the least sign of human sympathy.
“So, for a month, I had been wandering over
this magnificent island with the sensation that I
was at the end of the world. No more inns, no
taverns, no roads. You travel by mule-paths
hanging up, as it were, on a mountain-side, and
commanding tortuous abysses whence of an even-
ing you hear rising the steady sound, the dull and
deep voice, of the torrent. You knock at the doors
of the houses. Y r ou ask a shelter for the night
and something to live on till the morrow. And
you sit at the humble board, and you sleep under
the humble roof, and in the morning you press
the extended hand of your host, who lias guided
you as far as the outskirts of the village.
“ Now, one night, after ten hours’ walking, I
reached a little dwelling quite by itself at the
bottom of a narrow valley which was about to
throw itself into the sea a league farther on. The
two steep slopes of the mountain, covered with
brush, fallen rocks and great trees, shut in this
lamentably sad ravine like two sombre walls.
“Around the cottage were some vines, a little
garden, and, farther off, several large chestnut
trees —enough to live on; in fact, a fortune for
this poor country.
“The woman who received me was old, severe,
and neat —exceptionally so. The man, seated on
a straw chair near the door, rose to salute me,
then sat down again without saying a word.
“ His companion said to me—
“‘Excuse him, monsieur, he is deaf now. He
is over eighty-two years old.’
“She spoke tilt- French of France. I was sur-
prised.
“I asked her—
“ ‘ You are not of Corsica?’
•‘ She answered :
“‘No; wc arc from the Contim nt. But we have
lived here now' fifty years.’
“A feeling of anguish and of fear seized me at
the thought of those fifty years passed in this
gloomy hole, so far from the cities where human
beings dwell. An old shepherd returned, and we
began to eat the only dish there was for dinner,
a thick, soup, in which potatoes, bacon, and cab-
biges had been boiled together.
“ When the short repast was finished I went
a nl sat down before the door, my heart pinched
by the melancholy of the mournful landscape,
wrung by that distress which sometimes seizes
travellers on certain sad evenings in certain deso-
late places._ It seems that everything is near its
ending—existence, and the universe itself. You
perceive sharply the dreadful misery of life, the
terrible isolation of everyone, the nothingness of
all things, and the black loneliness of the heart
which nurses itself and deceives itself with dreams
until the very hour of death.
“ The old woman rejoined me, and, tortured by
that curiosity which ever lives hidden at the
bottom of the most resigned of souls :
i y° u come from France ?’ said she.
“ ‘ Yes ; I’m travelling for pleasure.’
‘“You are from Paris, perhaps?’
‘‘ ‘No. I am from Nancy.’
Vit seemed that an extraordinary emotion
agitated her. llow I saw, or rather felt it, Ido
not know.
“ She repeated in a slow' voice :
“ ‘ You are from Nancy ?’
“The man appeared in the door, impassible,
like all the deaf. She resumed :
“‘ It doesn’t make any difference. He can’t
hear. ’
“ Then, at the end of several seconds :
“ ‘ So you know people at Nancy?’
“ ‘ Oh, yes, nearly everybody.’
“ ‘ The family of Sainte-Allaize ?’
“‘Yes, very well; they were friends of. my
father.’
“ ‘ What are you called ?’
“ I told her my name. She regarded me fixedly,
then said, in that low voice which is roused by
memories :
Yes, yes; I remember well. And the
Brisemares, what has become of them ?’
They are all dead.’
“‘Ah! And the Sirmonts, do you know
them ?’ ”
“ ‘ Yes, the last of the family is a general.’ ”
“Then she said, trembling with emotion, with
anguish, witli I know not what feeling, confused,
powerful, and holy, with I do not know how
great a need to confess, to tell all, to talk of those
things which she had kept shut in the bottom of
her heart, and to speak of those whose name dis-
tracted her soul :
“ ‘ Yes, Henri de Sirmont. I know him well.
He is my brother.’
“ A.nd as I lifted my eyes at her, aghast with
surprise ; all of a sudden iny memory of her came
back.
“She had caused, once, a great scandal among
the nobility of Lorraine. A young girl, beautiful
and rich, Suzanne de Sirmont, had run away with
an under-officer in the regiment of hussars com-
manded by her father.
“lie was a handsome fellow, the son of a
peasant, but he carried his blue dolman very well,
this soldier who had captivated his colonel’s
daughter. She had seen him, noticed him, fallen
in love with him, doubtless while watching the
squadrons filing by.
“ But how she had got speech of him, how they
had managed to see one another, to hear from one
another; how she had dared to let him understand
she loved him —that was never known.
“Nothing was divined, nothing suspected. One
night when the soldier had just finish_d his time
of service, they disappeared together. llerpeo-
p‘e looked f< r them in vain. They never received-
tidings, and they considered hei as dead.
“So I found her in this sinister valley.
“Then in my turn I took up the word
“ ‘Yes, I remember. You are Mdlle Suzanne.’
“She made the sign ‘yes’ with her head. Tears
fell from her eyes. Then witli a look showing me
the old man motionless on the threshold of his
lint, she said —
“ ‘That is he.’
“ And I understood that she loved him yet,
that she still saw him with her bewitched eyes.
“ I asked—
“ ‘ Have you at least been happy?’
“She answered with a voice from her heart —
“ ‘ Oh, yes ! very happy. He has made me very
happy. I have never regretted.’
“I looked at her, sad, surpiised, astounded by
the sovereign strength of love ! That rich young
lady had followed this man, this peasant. She
was become herself a peasant woman. She had
made for herself a life without charm, without
luxury, without delicacy of any kind ; she had
stooped to simple customs. And she loved him
yet. She was become the wife of a rustic, in a
cap, in a cloth skirt. Seated on a straw-bottomed
chair, she ate from an earthenware dish, at a
wooden table, a soup of potatoes of cabbages with
bacon. She slept on a mattress by his side.
“ She had never thought of anything but of him.
She had never regretted her jewels, nor her fine
dresses, nor the elegancies of life, nor the per
fumed warmth of the cliambeis hung with tapes-
try, nor the softness of the down-beds where the
body sinks in for repose. She had never had need
of anything but him ; provided he were there, she
desired nothing.
“Still young, she had abandoned life and the
world and those who had brought her up, and
who had loved her. She had come, alone with
him, into this savage valley. And he had been
everything to her, all that one desires, all that one
dreams of, all that one waits for, all that one
holies for without end. lie had filled her life with
happiness from the one end to the other.
“ She could not have been more happy.
“ And all the night, listening to the hoarse
breathing of the old soldier stretched on the pallet
beside her who had followed liim so far, I thought
of this strange and simple adventure, of this hap-
piness so complete, and so true, made of so very
little.
“And I went away at sunrise, after having
pressed the hands of that aged pair.”
The story-teller was silent.
A .woman said
“ All the same, she had ideas which were too
easily satisfied, needs which were ‘too primitive,
requirements too simple. Sin could only have
been a fool.”
Another said, in a low, slow, and tender voice,
“ What matter ! she was happy. ’
And down there at tile end of the horizon,
Corsica was sinking into the night, returning
gently into the sea, blotting out her great shadow,
which had appeared as if in person to tell the story
of those two humble lovers who were sheltered by
her coasts. —From the French.

Sydney Evening News, in outbursts of
bogus patriotism and real ignorance, falls foul of
a 3001 b. lady named Blavatsky for quoting Aus-
tralian nigger atrocities as a proof that England
and her colonies are no better, but, in fact, rather
worse than Holy Russia in the matter of oppres-
sion. Madame Blavatsky is the co-editress with
Annie Besant, of a magazine called Lucifkk, and
it was in this periodical that the article appeared
which arcused the sleeping wrath of the News.
The Blavatsky quotes as her authority a young
Dane named Carl Lumholt/., who, some time ago,
wrote a book of mild adventure entitled
“ Amongst Cannibals.” The News s
his statements as absolutely false, or grossly exag-
gerated accounts of what might have been done
by a few miscreants in the past. It cannot be
denied, however, that the history of the decline
and death of the Australian black race before th e
white invader is so monotonous a tale of high-
handed might and callous cruelty that it forms
one of the most sickening chapters in the history
of man. The life of a blackfellow in the unsettled
country is by no means a sacred thing, and
men, otherwise honourable and humane, become
blunted in their perceptions as to the relations
between black and white. Madame has. without
knowing it, a certain amount of right on her side,
but the authority she quotes is rather a lame one.

suggest for a man who ate a Welsh rabbitlast night

not smile, she did not appear to be affected by the
appearance of his swelling chest or his wicked
eye. She simply said: “Why didn’t you heat
two Welsh rabbits and let ’m chase heach

British bitter-beer circles.
