the Dominant note in Australian Scenery.
TTIHAT is the dominant note in our scenery ?
njLl Marcus Clarke has called it “weird
melancholy.” I should call it weird ex-
pectancy. Essentially, it is neither sad
nor joyous.
But it is not an alert expectancy. It is an
indifferent, deliberate sense of waiting, a wait-
ing till one has become tired of waiting. Yet xt
is expectancy, all the same. Why expectancy ?
What is Australia waiting for ?
The expectancy seems to be consciously held. I
remember an Australian mountain landscape-
trees, a man, and a bird (a kookaburra). Up the
hill, the man unfolds his arms, lights his pipe,
puffs once or twice, refolds his arms and puffs on.
The bird flies from the limb where it has been so
long sitting, and lights on another limb, where it
will sit longer still. It, too, folds its wings, and
gives itself up to deliberation and expectancy.
And this.memory-picture of the man and the bird
is drawn from no single incident of my seeing.
On the plains, also, the note is one of expec-
tancy. There, too, Nature is deliberately waiting.
A hundred yards away, on a rise, you see a
kangaroo, or a horse, with pricked ears—listening !
You drive through a belt of mulga and come on
sheep. They stand away from you, “ giving ”as
a boat “ gives ” from the wind. Their shoulders
slant and their eyes are wondering ; but you know
(you knew it the instant you saw them) that they
have been waiting for something—not you, but
something else. All these things are a crystal-
lisation, an interpretation of the prevailing mood,
too vague, otherwise, to appeal to you as a
definable impression.
In the night you do not see these things, but
you see the stars and you hear the wind. The
wind comes to you over great uninhabited spaces,
desolate grey distances, and you feel somehow or
other that it would have a better story to tell and
a sweeter, more familiar appeal to your heart, if
it had the human note in it, if its sound Were
lightened with a laugh or saddened with a sigh.
And the stars 'are very near you at night on the
plains. They come down and mingle with your
thoughts, and they are your close and intimate
companions. You feel that their existence is
meant for you and that they are not things apart.
You feel that they too are waiting. Can it be for
you they are waiting ? You, and what you bring
into the world with your aching heart and working
brain ?
Yes, it is that which they are waiting for—the
trees and the winds and the plains and the stars.
They are waiting for the human note. All Australia
in its waste places is waiting for live men with the
fire of life in them, and a power of hand and brain
to transmute what is barren and unlovely into
something that shall be of use to man and beauti-
ful as his desire. And it is waiting for dead men
to mingle their dust with its dust. It is waiting
for love and for all noble and sweet emotions.
It is waiting for the new, high thought that
the years are slowly evolving. It is waiting
for a race of men whose every individual shall be
like Emerson’s man-child:
“ But he, the man-child glorious, —
Where tarries he the while ?
The rainbow shines his harbinger ,
The sunset gleams his smile.”
R.Q.
An Australian Pastoral Symphony.
771 HEN Fred. Cowen returned to England,
111 after conducting the concerts at the Mel-
Ljy bourne International Exhibition, he was
asked whether Australia liad given him
inspiration for an Australian Symphony. Mr.
Cowen’s reply was to this effect: “No; Australia
is purely a commercial country —with no history,
no romance, no scenery, tradition, &c., to supply
me with the material for a Symphony.’ Evidently
Cowen , never heard the voice of the Australian
Bush. Beethoven could compose the sublime
Pastoral Symphony with the humble assistance of
a meadow, a stream, a nightingale, a quail and a
few shepherds—material not to be compared with
that which is offered to a composer m Australia.
And the proof
It is January in the western (Lake) district of
Victoria. The moon is what sporting men term
a “ late full i.e., it rises about 9.30 p.m. The
trysting place is a large sweet-willow dam, any-
where in tliat triangle of country which has at its
points Colac, Ballarat and Camperdown. We
arrive at sundown ahd take our places of conceal-
ment at a spot commanding the shallow or feeding
ground of the dam. No pipes are allowed. The
thick willows which surround the dam on three
sides have cast their deep shadows over all the
water. Within the dam it is already night;
without it is barely dusk.
The moment our places are taken the concert
begins. The first to commence are two millions
of fiddlers and half-a-million of viola players,
represented respectively by one horizontal column
of lively mosquitoes and one ditto of brownish
beetles. They are performing delieious water-
music, which encourages one to jump up and clap,
not only hands, but face, legs, and arms likewise.
These performers are indefatigable, and never take
a single bar’s rest.
It is a welcome relief when a string of some forty
black swans put in their beautiful clarionet notes
as they fly past on their way to some large feeding
dam out on the plains. Listen to the cock bird,
friend Co wen. He gives only a single note, say F
sharp on the fifth line ; the hens, having more t®
say, answer with a most melancholy little grace
note and two quavers, something like this :
Take a C clarionet and you ’ll have an idea of the
travelling song of the black swan—l say an idea,
for nothing can reproduce this plaintive wail as it
fioat3 through the silent night of an Australian
Summer . . .
Ha ! what a note ! Like a full, rich, tenor
flute never to be created by human hand. Too
full and rich for the best concert flute, and too
free from nasal twang to resemble either oboe or
clarionet. I shall give it a name : the Cors
Australian, better known as the note of our
common wild magpie. It is a clarion note, and
fit for the finest orchestra in the world. The
willows around the dam are the magpies’ camping-
ground ; and during the evening they greet the
various feathered arrivals with their joyous and
far-carrying cadences.
Our orchestra is rapidly indreasing. The ’celli
and bassi have just made their appearance. They
are represented by sedate and sombre-looking
large black beetles, who, as becomes their instru-
ments and their evening dress, move in a most
dignified manner. After the Australian mode, they
have a trade as well as their musical profession.
Our ’celli and bassi are all grave-diggers and
undertakers, and are generally found beneath
some decaying matter.
Listen to the flutes ! They are the sweet notes
of our Australian nightingale, singing among the
willows. The ever-restless, noisy, and out-of-tune
picpolos are a mob of spur-winged plover on the
flat behind the dam. A mob of large musk-duck
in the centre of the dam, reinforced by some
mountain drakes that have just arrived, supply
our bassoons; whilst the brass is represented by
some millions of frogs of all sizes and voices. The
bass trombones especially, in the far corner of the
dani—-some score of old bull-frogs—seem to enjoy
the Symphony to their hearts’ content. Above the
brass, however, can be heard the huge contra-
fagotti—the deep notes of the bittern.
But hark! what is that ? At first a faint
whistling sound, with a crescendo never heard in
any orchestra —now it resembles the noise of a
hundred kettle-drums, now of thunder, now it is a
hissing swish—now there is silence! Friend
Covven, be easy ! It was only a large mob of
black duck that have just come in. There !
listen [—another mob—the dam will soon be alive
with them. Speed thee, fair moon ! My Pas-
toral Symphony is forgotten. lam thinking of
roast duck and green peas.
The moon has risen some time ago, and every
member of our party is counting the minutes till
she will peep above the willows and give sufficient
light to shoot by. A large mopoke arrives and
squats close by me on the dry limb of a dead
blackwood. He recalls the orchestra and the
Symphony: for this owl assumes the airs and
dignity of the Conductor. Calmly he surveys his
enormous orchestra. He seems to miss somebody.
I see him fidgetting. He is looking for the
drummer. Ha ! now he sights him with his keen
eyes. It is my black retriever. Don’t fret.
Signor! the drummer will be there at the tutti
and the grand finale— at the death ! . .
The moon is rising—the light is getting better
every minute. As I watch her I think of Haydn’s
Creation —of the passage in the recitativo: “In
splendour bright,” etc. I think of the long semi-
breve of the ’cello just before the passage : “With
softer beams and milder light, glides on through
silent night the silvery inoon ”... when—bang
—BANG—BANG—BANG—BANG—BANG 1 go the si*
barrels of the party.
You see, friend Cowen, I just then sighted a
beautiful mob within ten yards of me, and,
though thinking of noble Creation, miserable
sinner that I am, I indulged in destruction !
But let us listen to the grand tutti and the
finale. At the report of the first shot, every bird
(with the exception of the diving species) on the
water, in the willows, the curlews in the adjoining
flats, all and sundry rose on their wings. There
must have been thousands of them ; and their
simultaneous rising resembled a peal of thunder.
It was a “representation of Chaos” with a
vengeance. The however, soon restored
order. The signal was given, and the ducks were
duly brought ashore. . . .
Now, sir, have you got your material for an
Australian Symphony ? or will it be only a matter
of roast duck and green peas ?
L.B.
night in the Bush: maortland.
r grows cold, for the sun set an hour ago, and
a light wind has sprung up, rustling noisily
through the stiff skirts of the Bush till it
reaches the dark line of ratas on the burnt
ridge of the terrace yonder. How strong aud wise
a>nd stern they look, with their blaokened trunks
and grand old heads against the sky !
The cool wind creeps up among their shrivelled
branches, and scatters little puffs of ashes and
cinders and dead leaves—debris from the bush-fire
of yesterday. Did they think within those iron
hearts that it was the end of all tilings for them,
as nearer and nearer leaped the dancing demons
of the fire ? How the flames roared and crackled
through the underscrub, licking up the saplings
and bender young fern-trees in their path, till,
like a fierce mob laying rude hands upon its
rulers, they flung themselves upon the ratas —the
forest kings ! But the North Wind heard the cry
of the beleaguered Bush, and hurrying up his
cloud brigades, flung down the long life-lines of
the rain. How the ratas must have joyed to see
the red demon of the fire hiss out his life in curses
at their feet! And so to-night they stand battle-
scarred, but triumphant, like giants with scorched
beards and blackened brows.
The air is very still: away down the hill, a hun-
dred feet below, the little creek is fussing noisily
among its boulders; and from the rim of the flax
swamp comes the long shrill cry of a weka,
followed almost instantly by a faint response from
the dark heart of the bush. The cry of the weka!
What memories it brings back—of grey bush twi-
lights in the old camp by the river—of nights upon
the Dead-tree plain, with the bare, white trunks
of the pines standing gaunt and gleaming in the
moonlight, and the soft grey mantle of the mist
hanging low upon the shoulders of the bush
beyond.
Now it is quite dark, and here and there the
stars are blinking through the black lace-work of
the tree-tops. Strange to think that those million
gleaming eyes have looked upon so many crimes.
Yet it is at night that our greatest and worst
thoughts come to us ; the fire that has smouldered
through the heat of noon often waits only the
darkness to burst into flames and sweep all before
its path. Thus foul deeds have been done at
night—deeds that could have found no hole
obscure enough beneath the eye of the sun. But
surely here, in the quiet heart of the Bush, no evil
thing could live.
The wind still rustles through the tresses on
the dark heads of the rimus, but in the under-
scrub it is very still, and the air is heavy with the
faint, sweet scent of a ribbon-tree. From a mero
close by a tui gurgles out a few sleepy chest-notes
before he finally dozes for the night, and borne
along the gully comes the far hoot of a mopoke. . .
The darkness has drawn closer now, and many
stars are watching with keen bright eyea that
seem to look into men’s souls.
Here and there, from the roots of an upturned
tree or where the soil is broken in a dusky hollow,
the glow-worms are glittering like fairy lamps,
and above all and beyond all and behind all is the
mysterious meaning—the magnetism of the Bush !
Oh, the Bush ! the strong, wise, conscious, mighty
Bush, that never sleeps, but is always watching
and waiting. Meaning, to those who understand
it not, only ineffable ennui, melancholy, mono-
tony, madness; but to those who are its lovers
giving comfort and deep peace, and that inde-
finable sense of corr panionship, nearness, that
reaches the heart the silent hand-clasp of a
friend.
You who are tempted and passion-driven, and
you who are of the Fate-fighters, faint-hearted,
half doubting the wisdom of your strife, go carry
your secret to the old mother Bush. Creep into
her strong, deep arms, and lay your head upon
her spacious lap : she will take your hot hands in
her cool fingers, and breathe high counsel in your
ears as one who says : “ See, I am still and strong
—go you and be likewise ! ”
UNDER SONG.
There’s music in the long
Deep-throated Bush,
Low humming in the hush.
Odd bars of song :
Soft singing in the trees
In tongues unknown —
A reminiscent tone
On minor keys:
Boughs swaying to and fro.
Though no -winds pass —
Taint odours in the grass,
Where no flowers grow;
And fluttering of wings.
And birds' sweet vows
Once babbled on the boughs
Of faded Springs.
That murmur in the air
That ebbs and waves,
Is music from the graves
Of all things fair.
And mingles in the still
Of twilight’s hush
With voices of the Bush
From swamp and hill.
He who has shed soul-husk
May catch that tone —
May feel it through the lone,
Grave halls of Dusk
Low ringing in his ears ;
And ponder long
The meaning of the song
He faintly hears.
R.W.
A Bard Unskilled.
H E lines following hold more essential poetry
fi than you will find in ail the literary verses that—
v Andrew Lang, say—ever wrote ; and alas! lacking
form, they cannot lire. Rough, unooath—ail
granted—but who doubts their inspiration f
King e? the Drought.
This is a song of the Drought's dread King,
The Blaok, Black Crow of Queensland.
He merrily soars—flaps his raven wivm
O’er the stricken plains of Queensland.
And greatly blessed by the Devil is he :
The Blaok, Black crow of Queensland ;
His food is cheap, and his beak is free
Of the stricken herds of Queensland.
For him the youngling lamb is born
On the dusty downs of Queensland.
Where yon Mirage veils the plain —
Vain stamps the ewe — for all forlorn
Is the lamblet'sfate in Queensland.
Oh—hard beset is the mothering ewe,
One crow's at her head ; behind her two
But above her lamb she tries to stand.
Alas 1 the unequal fight's soon o'er ;
Over the Crow-cursed plain
The poor ewe bleats—but bleats in vain,
The loving, brave ewe of Queensland.
The water dries in the creek's deep bed—
Dries daily down, and the mud is glue.
Once in two days she comes for a drink,
The good old Queensland ewe—
Once in two days — it’s a twelve mile run
To the comer where grass still stands,
Nineteen months old —nineteen hundred and one
Fell the rain from which it grew.
Hurrah for the Crow—Alack for the Ewe —
At last in the Bog she is fast ;
Merrily down flutters a cawing crew
On the poor bogged ewe of Queensland.
When the rolling Downs were fair to see
And sweet and green the grass ;
Broad acres of lovely Mitchell —
So thick you scarce could pass ;
Many a blossoming Winter—and panting Summer-tide—
The old ewe reared her lambkins — never a one there died
Though with twinlets.
More than a dozen
She reared with a mother’s pride.
Here she is dying alone — Alone—
None of them by her side.
The Drover’s eye the flock glanced through—
“ You must draft the old ones out;
For the young must travel both fast and far
If you want to outpace this Drought."
So the young ewes start on the weary track
For many a dusty day—Till the long drought ends
They cannot come back—so they travel far away.
On their once good home the old ewes stay
And fight for life their best —
They eat the Wattles—they eat grass roots.
They never seem to rest.
Perhaps in some, dumb, feeble way—
Voicelessly for rain they pray ;
But one by one they are trapped in the bog,
The sticky bog of Queensland.
And now comes the chance for the Cruel Crow,
The Black, Black Crow of Queensland.
He crowns the old ewe with a crown of Pain
She struggles hard —but it’s all in vain —
Soon another martyr of Drought will be slain
On the blood-stained Creeks of Queensland.
Eyeless and tongueiess, she piteous lies.
Tormented by Crows and ants and flies —
For hours and hours she slowly dies —
The poor bogged ewe of Q ueensland.
Down the creek a-crawling slow
On his horse feed-grudged and poor
The boundary rider comes in sight.
•• Hullo—Another bogged last night I"
Then a friendly knife—soon ends the life
Of the Poor Old Ewe of Queensland.

Woman Who Watts.
Another —
Far, far in the Sunny Forth
There’s a quiet lonely home —
Where a Woman u-aits for Me, for Mo—
Her heart is mine, though far 1 roam
Away from the Sunny North.
Far, far a way in the Sunny North
Overhead shines the blue, blue sky,
And blue eyes shine through a mist of tears:
A faithful heart throbs with anxious fears
Since a Wanderer said good-bye
To his Home in the Sunny North.
Oh—Fate is hard and her ways are strange.
For she severs hearts that are true ;
But she binds those close with steely bonds
Whose loves and likes are few.
So far from my Northern Girl I range
Among friends both old and new—
My heart is hers and will not change.
I fret—
Till my feet for a Northern track are set
Where treeless Downs stretch wild and free :
They 're Hate to some—but they 're Love to me—
Where wild Fast utinds si>ig a song of the Sea,
The sea that rolled there anciently—
And the great Sky Domes above :
There lies my nest —kissed by the Sun,
The home of my dove, my lonely dove,
Who, nestling there, breathes daily prayer
From her heart of Love for her lonely wandering One-

WHAT 18 GRANDER 1 What prize that is better can this world offer to a man 1 None ! No, sir ! If you have these two ster-
ling qualities, you are at the pinnacle Don't be a weakling, don’t be a HALF-MAN. Nature intended you to be strong and
healthy ; if you are not, it is your own fault, and it lies with you whether or not you will remedy your condition. If you are
one of those unfortunates WITHOUT NERVE, void of all these fine sentiments that make a man, undecided in your actions,
lacking the vim, the snap and fire of youth, it is because your functional organs are weak. Your NERVOUS SYSTEM is undermined
and wasting aw’ay You know why. Now then ! you know that you don’t want to go on like this j you want to be strong, vigorous,
and full Of courage. You have been disappointed and defrauded by quacks ! you’ve taken barrels of nasty drugs, and
they have not helped you a bit and never will. Your body is like an engine without steam. Oiling the parts won’t make the engine go.
Pouring injurious tissue-destroying drugs into your stomach won't create vigorous circulation; won’t build new nerves, won’t cure you. NO! NOT IN
A THOUSAND YEARS. You need°new nerve life pumped into your body for hours at a time—a steady, life-giving current of ELECTRICITY
USED WITHOUT DRUGS. It will not fail you.
dr. McLaughlin’s electric belt
offers you electricity. IT IS ELECTRICITY, AND ELECTRICITY
IS LIFE. It pours a strong current of electricity into your body for
hours at a time. Worn while, you sleep, it does not inconvenience you
T> ponqfmefed to earrv the current into your nerve centre at the back, and the current can be conveyed to any part of the body where disease

FAILS. No other remedy can reach the seat of trouble as can its subtle influence. It is a positive
RHEUMATISM. STOMACH or KIDNEY TROUBLES. It is not a CURE ALL,
NOTHING ELSE IS
a positive cure for WEAK BACK, INSOMNIA, LUMBAGO,
but never fails when recommended.
From Tasmania.
The pains in my back and shoulders are quite gone, and my back
and nerves are now much better. I can sleep at night now without
those horrible dreams that use to torment me.

Dear Sirs,—l am sending you a report of my condition, and am
glad to tell you that I am gradually improving. My spirits are
lighter and brighter, and the dreadful dreams which I had at night
have greatly subsided, and I can again feel pleasure in ">y surround-
ings. [f I can find any more acquaintances needing help I will
be glad to recommend your Belt, and will never fail to do

The doctors here had done all possible for me, and could only
relieve my terrible Sciatica. In three days your Belt stopped the
pain, and now I am entirely well. I had suffered for years, and I
can never repay you for what you’ve done.
Yours gratefully,
Angel Terrace, Coolgardie. P. W. KELLY
" From N.S.W.
The Dr. McLaughlin Co.
Dear Sirs.—Your Belt is doing me a lot of good, and I feel twice
the fellow since I got it, having only had two slight attacks since I
have worn the Belt, but they were i othing to speak of. I consider
it worth twice as much as I gave foi it.
I would advise anyone suffering in a similar manner to try one, as
it is worth its weight in gold. I remain yours, truly,
Mt. Keira. CHARLES STONE.
From Queensland.
Dear Sirs,—l suffered for a long time from general weakness, de-
bility, and nervous exhaustion. I tried everything—change of
climate, etc.—but your Belt gave me the first real relief I ever had,
and ultimately cured me. I can never thank you enough for what
you have done for me. Yours truly, .JOHN KING.

Tub Dr. McLaugun Co.
Dear Sirs. —I was so delighted with my Balt that I quite forgot
all about writing to you. I am pleased to be able bo tell you that
the pain over my heart has entirely disappeared already, and I
don’t tire so easily as I used to. lam more than pleased and will
always recommend your Belt.
I remain, yours sincerely,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mark Twain recently, by the breaking of
a strap, to which he was clinging on a crowded
tramcar, was dumped into the lap of a fashion-
ably-dressed woman. Mark arose and bowed.
“Madam,” said he, “this is the first time the
tram company ever conferred a favor on me.”
The Pharisee.
He did not stand with open palm,
Hand-feeding Charity ;
He did not raise the nasal psalm
On Sabbath-days— not he !
When he went walking down the street,
With men of high degree,
He stopped upon his way to meet
And greet the like of me.
He did not care for praise or pelf—
Such meanness lie despised ;
He would not advertise himself
Yet he was advertised.
He never spoke an unctuous grace
When friends at meals he met.
But Benediction on his face
Shone like an omelette.
In King-street, down below the Court,
He used to take his stand—
This Gentleman of Good Report,
This Man with Open Hand.
The Wreck, unshaved, unclean, unkempt—
The brilliant man sunk low,
Would find the friend of whom he dreamt
In Mr. So-and-So.
He did not care for praise or pelf,
Nor blame that poor man’s vice-
But gave him fourjience for himself—
With half-an-hour’s advice.
He did not play a solemn part,
His style was frank and free—
And yet, somehow. I knew at heart
He was a Pharisee.

Number One!
When you’ve changed your last half-sovereign,
which you tried to keep intact,
And are dodging friends who knew you very well
till you got sacked,
You begin to think in earnest where your thought
should have begun—
To set value on the doctrine of Look after Number
One /
And you see that most affected is the man whom
you neglected—
(Number One !)
You become a woeful cynic with the past in cold
review,
And the future in the distance; “and the goed
that you can do”
(When you get another billet and you’ve shaken
off the dun)
Will be mapped and calculated for the good of
Number One:
If you only had suspected, you would stir 3 ha\e
recollected—
(Number One !)
For vour linen’s getting dirty and your landlady’s
austere^
(No - ! it’s her living, and your board is in
arrear) t
ed to kiss the daughter—now she se. s
you but to shun :
That hardens you completely ; the whole world 8
for Number One l
You get thoroughly dejected when you’ve fairly
vivisected—
(Number One !)
There seems nothing that will rouse you, for
despair has kinked your soul,
And you ask what you were born for—no one
wants you ! Why condole
With what you call your Liok, It*s out! —you
had a decent run;
But you hadn’t then the savee to take care of
Number One. (
You grow maudlin, disconnected, for you’ve really
resurrected—
(Number One!)
And the drinks you buy don’t soothe you when
you have them on your own :
They used to make you blithesome; now you want
to moan and groan.
■fl « .'nos take on a deeper hue where once came
bub 1 ing fun,
Till your silver turns to copper looking after
Number One.
Poor fool, and misdirected ! It is time that you
reflected—
(Number One!)
Up 1 rouse yourself. Go forward! strut and
swagger down the street,
And buttonhole the first substantial friend you
chance to meet.
As: hi m nicely for a tenner —as a loan; it’s simply
don*.

Long and Weary Suffering.
REieumatic Fever and a Torpid Liver*
An Eight Years Permanent Cure.
Th<a Case of Mrs. 11. R. LAWLER.
(BY A SYDNEY REPORTER).
Every scientific discovery means the
introduction of some commodity for tiie
purpose of rendering a service ft* the
multitude of its users, and as the public's
ready appreciation of ev- rything possc-Nsing
in hputatde merit is observable on all sides,
as will bo noticed by the remarks of Vrs.
Hester Rose Lawler, of No. 4 * roadstaire-
street, Ba'main, it is cotnddered necessary
to place tiie follow iug narrative before tbe
general reader.
Mrs. Lawler’s introdnefory statement
was :—“ Several years before I married I
was taken ill with rheumatic fever. Ail my
joints swelled up and we-o most painful, my
knees 1 cing particularly bad. My head was
.-Iso terribly swollen, besides b< ing so
afflicted with severe pains that I scarcely
knew what I was doing half n»y time. Hie
doctor gave me some medicine which caused
a burning sensation in my chest, and I felt
so distressed after taking cacti dose that I
asked him to change it, but he said it was
the best medicine he could give me.”
Reporter : “ Wa* t here no case whatever
derivab e from the treatment he gave yon ?”
Mrs.- Lawler: “Not the slightest.
Previous to my attack I was an unusually
strong w oman, capable ®f wort-ing bard all
day without showing any signs of fatigue,
but for four years afterwards I was subject
to such sudd n seizures of inten e pains and
fain ness that in tho middle of any light
task i was often compelled to leave tne
work unde'e and lie down for the rest of
the day. With my theumatism can.o a
complete collapse of the system, everything
seeming to t o wrong at once. The terrific
agonies running through tny body kept me
awake at nights, so that when I ought to
have > ceti getting up I felt fo dead beat and
depressed that I had no ability or desire to
do anything. Thus the days and months
dragg d wearily on, and tny condition was
ge ting worse all the time. My appetite
was in a very bad way too, for i seldom wanted
any food, and if 1 took a little it di 1 not do
me any good realise it would not digest.”
Reporter : “ llow could you t«*>l that?”
Mrs. Lawler: ‘ Because I felt almost
stifled through having a heavy pain in the
ches for one th ng. and mv stomach felt as
unsettle as if I ha I drunk a cupful of
yeast. Sometimes the food turned po itircly
sour ami came up again, but before it was
vomited I always suffered acutely f otn
internal pains, i ilicusness cave tny mouth
such a nasty taste that retelling used to
co i o on, and what an aw fit 1 time I had with
sick head cites ! They made my eyes feel
swol en, and tny sight was bad. Tito
swollen state of tny a ikies and feet often
prevented tne from putting tny shoes on,
yet, in a way, this did not matter much, as
I was generally too weak to walk about.
There was also something radically wrong
with tny shoulders, as I could teel a sharp
pain between them which gave me more
annoyance thati enough, and tho aches in my
loins were even worse. Suffering so long
and seeing myself going down hill year after
year at la*t made me utterably miserable,
and fears about the future were constantly
thrusting themselves upon n y mind.”
Reporter: “Ate you naturally of a
nervous temperament?”
Mrs. Lawler : “ Not by any moms ; but
when I was ill my nervous system was
greatly weakened, and if anything startled
me 1 could feel them jumping as though
they had been cut loose. People say that
life is sweet un ’er ol;y circumstances, but I
used to think I would rather die titan live
this c unbearably painful existence any
longer. Up to this time I could never
understand why peop'e should look at the
black aide of evervthing, and allow them*
selves to think of all sorts of things that are
going to happen ; but that is exactly the
frame of mind I was in, so it must be ill-
health which accounts for such unhappiness.
Anyway, I was 100 weak and weary to
trouble much about anything, but, thank
Cod ! all that has passed, ami fore g’it years
I have been free from all the tormenting
symptoms which were bearing me down to
the grave.”
Reporter: “You had a change in your
treatment, I presume?”
Mr 3. Lawler: “ You may depend I had,
or ebe I would not be aide to speak to you
as I have done, and it was a friend who
gave the advice which resulted in the
obliteration of my maladies. Ho was a
friend of my husband's, and heB* dhe could
recommend something that would do mo
good. *lt is Clements Tonic,’ he said. ‘ and
you cannot go wrong if you take it, because
it cured me when 1 was in the same state
as you are in now.’ Dubious as I was
through losing confi ence in previous mtdi-
cim-8, I purchased some Clements Tonic,
aud before going anv further I would like
to state that it was the only medicine which
did me any good at all. The revivifying
eff cts of Clements Tonic were nothing short
of miraculous, as two or three botties set
new vigour cot.r ing through my weakened
system, and I passed from a long period of
melancholy hope lees ness to a life of comfort
and cheerfulness. It took a little time, of
course, but the fact remains that Clem'nts
Tonio gradually braced me up and started
to ease my pains very quickly. My pe> pie
pot a surprise when Ittarted to eat, localise
it was so long since I had experienced the
sensation <-f beinv huncry, ami my appetite
became n ore vigorous as the days went by.
I am positive that nothing in the world
can equal Clements Tonic for producing
refreshing and peaceful sleep, as it made
me sleep shortly after retiring to bed,
dreams never troubling me, and when I
awoke there was no bitter taste to sicken
me, and the aching sensations had left my
head ami limbs.”
Reporter. “Your rheumatic pains—did
Clements Tonic affect them?”
Mrs Lawler: “Affect them ! Why, w-hen
I cou d take plenty of fo d without vomit-
ing or retching, or feeling * ny pains in the
chest or 6tomach after meals, I was nearly
a? w°U as ever, because by that time the
swellings in my limbs had gone down aud
the rheumatic pains were h idly noticeable.
All I wanted was another botile «.r two of
Cl nmnts Tonic, a d you may be assured
that I got them. The end to my sufferings
was assure'! in the tone and steadiness wh.ch
Clements 'Tonio imparted to my nervous
system, and in due course there was
no'hing in my appearance to indicate that
I had gone through the serious illness winch
hat! s-t at defiance all other medicines
excepting Clements Tonic.”
Reporter: “ may I bring your statements
be ore the public? ”
Mrs. Lawler: “You are at liberty to
publish them in any way you think best,
as I cannot sp‘ ak too freely or too gratefully
about Clements Tonic for giving me the
splendid health I now enjoy.”

Ruberoid is made in four thicknesses, called “ plies,” but only one quality (the Best) and one color (Grey).
The thickest (3-ply) is a shade under an eighth of an inch thick. All plies must be laid over some kind
of a foundation, such as close boarding, 3m. by lin. battens, or 36m. x 3m. x 16 gauge galvanised wire
netting. Painting is not necessary, but is recommended at the end of 18 to 24 months. If used according
to our recommendations, Ruberoid will make the face of every user beam with satisfaction. Genuine
Ruberoid Roofing, properly used, will “ look well,” “ wear well,” and give excellent satisfaction for many

The Clown in Politics.
The full free franchise was only a step
towards democracy ; not its achievement, as
many persist in thinking. The people,
given the power to rule, have yet to learn
how to rule. Until they do—and that end,
it seems, will only come from a long and
somewhat tedious process of education—they
will be apt to lean towards “demagoguey”
rather than democracy ; to exalt the “gift
of the gab ” as the most valuable acquire-
ment of a politician ; and to prefer entertain-
ing insincerity to plain-speaking honesty.
They will be “apt to lean,” but will not on
all occasions lean. The popular mind, even
in its times of densest ignorance, is, fortu-
nately, liable to moments of illumination,
when sophistries are swept away, gabblers
confounded, and clean, blunt honesty
enthroned in power. This is parti-
cularly so at times of crisis, of na-
tional danger and difficulty. Then the
glory of “gab” is for a while obscured, and
the people turn to a Washington, who
never made a joke, and lacked even that
most essential qualification of the politician
—the power to tell a lie ; to a Benito
Juarez, the reformer of the long arm and
the heavy hand and the hard heart, who
never turned a pretty speech and never
spoke at all when he could avoid doing so ;
or (in lesser circumstances) to a dour, silent
Parnell ; or a dull-seeming, plain-brown
George Turner, with his invaluable capa-
city of looking after a nation’s half-crowns as
if they were his own. But in normal times,
in the days when a great national, crisis, an
overmastering wrong, or an acute financial
difficulty is lacking to frighten the demo-
cratic voters into their senses, the “gift of
the gab” generally has a great political
power, and the people give themselves up
freely, like the opium smoker to his drug, to
the seductive sophistries of the “ entertain-
ing ” speaker and the “ iloquent ” blather-
skite.
• • • •
The vogue of Mr. George Reid is a con-
spicuous Australian example. Mr. Reid
has no attributes of honesty or of ability to
plead for him. As a politician he has not
even attempted to conceal the fact that his
only motive has been “to become top dog ;
and that he is prepared to take a friendly
attitude, a hostile attitude, or a Yes-No
attitude (this last attitude he invented and
holds the patent rights for—it is the attitude
which marks the highest point of insincerity
to which a public man can attain) just as the
circumstances seem to suggest. His political
ignorance is as great as his political dis-
honesty. Knowing nothing of philosophy,
of economics, or of finance, he carefully
cherishes his ignorance by neglecting all
opportunities of study. He is a man
who never reads a book (perhaps, in his
own interests, he is right ; a little knowledge
might prove a dangerous thing to his entirely
complacent illiteracy). And Mr. Reid is
under no delusions as to his capabilities.
He recognises the source of his power and of
his notoriety, and when it comes to him to
advise young men as to the secret of success
in life, the best he can tell them is to imitate
him, to join a debating society, to learn to
gab, to speak without having anything to
say, and then to inflict themselves on the
country as statesmen. Mr. Reid, in fact,
believes himself and that life-object to be
admirable. He is as proud of his fatuous
fluency as an aborigine is of the brass plate
which adorns his belly and proclaims him
the unworthy “king” of an unworthy
people. Nothing is more noble to his
mind than the capacity to say nothing about
nothing at great length.
• • • •
Judged by the standard of success he
is in a measure right. Mr. Reid held office
in N.S.W. as Premier for some years ; he is
now Leader of the Opposition in the Austra-
lian Parliament with a possible succession
(remote and improbable, hut still possible) to
the Australian Premiership ; and, when he
is announced to speak in any town, and no
charge is made for admission, the people
flock to hear him and the variety-halls and
circuses (which may he more entertaining
but are not so cheap) are for the time almost
deserted. It is true that he so far has failed,
in spite of frequent attempts, to induce the
electors to pay one shilling admission to
listen to his entertaining and airy nothings,
and that occasionally in a big city, when
other amusing attractions abound, he finds
it necessary to eke out his quips and
antic phrasas with a free organ recital,
to secure an overflow audience. But
these are, after all, not very great limita-
tions. The fact remains that Mr. Reid is
the most successful political speaker in Aus-
tralia, that he can secure attention where
others fail, and that his amusing speeches
have a material effect in deciding the issues
of elections. When the cause of so-called
“Freetrade” lost Mr. Reid’s support in
N.S.W. it faded utterly away, and has not
since been able to make any stand at all ;
and in Federal politics his attractiveness as
a public speaker threatens to have a very
marked influence at the next electoral
appeal.
• • • •
This attractiveness, which is so great as
to he, to an extent, a political factor, out-
weighing in some minds issues of principle
and moment, depends mainly on two facts—
Mr Reid’s ignorance and Mr. Reid’s
assumption of a jolly and “rollicking”
spirit. Because Mr. Reid knows nothing
that his hearers do not know, he is saved
from the mistake (from an entertainment
point of view) of seeking to mix instruction
with amusement. Working on the plane of
their minds, or a degree or so below it, he
never wearies with any demand on the intel-
ligence of his audiences. It is not that Mr.
Reid is exactly a humorist. Mr. John
Haynes, another N.S.W. celebrity, has, on
the whole, more humor in speaking, whilst Mr.
Hughes, M.H.R., has much more and, with
it, knowledge. But Mr. Reid is essentially a
“ jolly ” speaker, and physically he is fat,
which helps the “ jolly ” impression. When
a fat, jolly gentleman strips off his dignity
and comes down to the level of the mentally
poorest of his audience to be amusing—well
those who don’t laugh with him laugh at
him, and the fun is unmistakable.
• • * •
It is not necessary to enter into any argu-
ment as to the evil resulting from a state of
public mind which allows ignorance and
humor (and that not of the highest kind) to
have a material effect in deciding great
issues. That must be patent. The fact
that Mr. Reid can (probably) influence a
very large number of voters by “tickling the
ears of the groundlings ” is not at all
a comforting one. Still, it does not
justify undue pessimism. The democracy
is probably learning its lessons surely, if
somewhat slowly, and there will come a time
when merit and not mimetic skill will decide
political issues between individuals and
principles. Meanwhile great occasions are
fortunately apt to produce great men equiva-
lent to them. The Reids flourish in com-
monplace times ; when the need arises, the
strong man appears “ the proof of the raefr
and of the ability of the universe : when he
appears, the old customs and phrases are
confronted, turned back, or laid away.”
The “funny” politician has his little day.
It is seldom that he is allowed to obtrude
when really serious matters come to the
front. He is merely “ the comic relief ”of
the drama of government.
The Next Freetrade Ministry and its
Protectionist Policy.
Dugald Thomson, of N.S.W., represents North
Sydney in the Australian House of Representa-
tives, and is understood to be one of the larger-
sized men of the party which preaches Freetrade
and practises a large measure of Protection, and
lies by denying that it does so. He is, at least, a
l>ig enough man among those who seek to sell
Australia to the German importers to have some
right to speak on their behalf. And Dugald the
Unfixable has been explaining to Brisbane Courier
the attitude of his party, which, as usual, seems
to have one foot in the sea and one foot in the air,
and no fixed or definite habitation anywhere :
As regards Freetrade, 1 have admitted, and so has Mr.
Reid, that to raise- the sum expected from the Customs
there cannot he an ideal Freetrade tariff such as that
adopted, on the motion of the Reid Government, in New
South Wales, but have added there can he a tariff on
Freetrade lines, one less burdensome, and calculated, in
my opinion, to be far more beneficial to the commercial
and industrial interests of Australia than the present
abortion. I have certainly never ventured an opinion aa
to how many, or how few, lines Mr. Reid would seek to
alter were he in power.
That is the Freetrade position—the great and
glorious Freetrade position—as defined by a pro-
minent Freetrader. After all, is it worth while
to be a Freetrader if the splendid goal that lies
ahead amounts to so very little ?
• • • •
The Freetrade party has been, ever since Aus-
tralia knew it, a lukewarm concern of shifts and
apologies, with a pathetic unwillingness to sample
its own creed. In N.S.W., until 1891, it pro-
tected, in one way and another, such a vast
number of industries that it is difficult to say
what wasn’t protected. After 1895, when the
Dibbs Protectionist tariff was abolished, came
the “ideal Freetrade tariff” of George Reid,
which also protected a good many things and
sacrificed revenue to do it ; it cut down the
excise on many articles far below the customs
duty levied on the same articles when im-
ported, and the difference was loss of revenue
and loss of its own fiscal principles at the same
time. And now, it appears, the Freetrade party,
bitterly as it denounces every line of the existing
Protectionist tariff, really doesn’t know how many,
or how few, of the Protectionist items contained
therein it will alter should it come into power. If
its alleged principles amount to anything it will
alter the whole lot, but unfortunately its principles
never do amount to much.
• • • •
The Bulletin has no grievance against any
Freetrade party for being a Freetrade party. If
it believed in its own alleged beliefs, and practised
its own alleged beliefs when the op|>ortimity came
in its way, it would call for all possible resjject by
reason of its sincerity, however misguided it
might be. But for a party which preaches Free-
trade and practises a large measure of Protection ;
which sometimes denies that it is practising Pro-
tection (which is a lie), and sometimes says that it is
driven to practise it for the sake of revenue (which
is another lie) ; which is always pointing to the
“ progress” of N.S.W. during the last ten years
of semi-Protection as evidence of the pros|>erity
that arises through Freetrade (which is a third
lie) ; which, if it gets into power, will practise a
large measure of Protection again, and call the
results thereof a splendid vindication of the Free-
trade policy (which will be a fourth lie) ; and
which stumps the country jeering at and traducing
the policy by which it makes its own low-down and
surreptitious crust —for a party like that there is
no room for anything save contempt. Freetrade,
honestly believed in, and honestly practised, is as
respectable, as pure, and as patriotic as any other
policy, for even error is resectable when it ia
honest and above-board. But Freetrade, as the
term is understood by the Reids, M’Millans,
and Dugald Thomsons, is a fraud that no decent
citizen can afford to touch, or to have found dead
in the vicinity of his own remains.
* • • •
The great principle of Freetrade lies in giving
the local producer no advantage whatever over
the foreign one—in placing them both on a level—
in letting the cool, fresh air of competition blow
out of all the foetid dens of Asia on this country’s
industries. If there are no duties on either the
foreign or the local article, or if they are subject
to exactly similar duties, then the great principle
of Shoddy is arrived at equally well. That is how
things were worked in Great Britain when there
was real Freetrade in that country, and they can
be worked on exactly the same lines here.
Australia can raise as much revenue under real
Freetrade principles as under Protectionist ones,
and there is no need for the Freetrade party to
crawl down, unless crawling is its natural mode of
locomotion, nor to sell its sacred principles as the
other Iscariot person did of old. It can retain
or even increase the wine, spirit, beer and tobacco
import duties, and fix the excise on the local
articles at an exactly corresponding rate. It can
tax on strictly revenue principles tea, coffee, and
other articles that are not locally produced.
And after that it can impose customs duties
on almost anything, with a corresponding ex-
cise in each case, till it gets the revenue
it wants. Protection only raises revenue on
the imported article, therefore Protection isn’t
a great device for screwing money out of
the people. The Freetrade principle allows
the imported article and the locally-manufactured
one to be equally taxed; and as a scheme for
extracting coin out of the people it beats Protec-
tion every time. The Freetrader who professes
to be driven to practise Protection in order to get
revenue is something worse than an Ananias— lie
is a crude and unconvincing ass. With a customs
and excise -tariff covering two or three dozen
articles, the Freetrader could raise as much
revenue as is produced by Kingston’s elaborate
tariff, and let the bracing atmosphere of free
competition blow on us out of every sweater’s
hovel on earth at the same time.
* • * *
Yet, sad to say, he prefers not to do this. He
insists on losing revenue by not levying excise
duties to counter-balance his customs duties.
He asserts that Protection is ruinous to the
country, and he insists, out of pure malignity, in
ruining the country. He says that Freetrade is
the one thing that will save the country, and out
of sheer wickedness he won’t save the country
when he gets the chance. He actually gives away
money for the sake of being a traitor ; it isn’t a
case of the priests paying Judas for being a
traitor, but of Judas paying the priests and being
a traitor gratis—or, rather, at a dead loss. The
Bulletin has no objection to a real Freetrade
Ministry holding office in Australia; the loss
would be heavy for the time, but that Ministry
wouldn’t last long, and with it the Freetrade
myth and the weary fiscal controversy would end
for a century or two. But judging from the
assurances of the party leaders, there isn’t going
to be any Freetrade Ministry in Australia, even
if the Reid crowd gets into office, but just the old
lie and fraud and steal over again. There will be
a Ministry which practises enough Protection to
keep the country’s industries from falling into utter
wreck, just as Freetrade Ministries have done
before. The Freetrade myth will be kept alive
by the assurances of a brassy and shameless crowd
of office-seekers that this is Freetrade, and that
the results obtained from it are the blessings
attendant on Freetrade. There will be the usual
jibes at Protection, while the party in office holds
its position by surreptitiously practising the
policy that it denies. The Kingston party asks
the country to retain it in power because it prac-
tises Protection and believes in it. The Reid-
M’Millan-Dugald Thomson party asks to be
put into power.because it is going to preach one
thing and practise another—because it is going to
be a political sham nnd a public and palpable lie.
If Australia wants Freetrade it had better find a
new set of Freetrade leaders who will supply it
with the real article.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Victoria’s Alleged Loss of Population.
No one who looked back on the history of Victoria,
could hut he struck with the fact that though it was a
eery larvfe and rich country, it had a very small popula-
tion, and that the population had ceased to grow during
• recent period. It devolved ii|k>ii those who were
placed in positions of responsibility to endeavor to see
what were the causes of this. Victoria had been
“ fiddling ” too much with Socialism. —Premier Irvine of
Victoria.
The alx>ve tale, alie idy alluded to in this paper,
apjieara to Iw spreading farther and wider every
day. Invink, the reactionary, invented the
alleged fact aljout Victoria's ixjpulation having
ceased to increase in order that lie might denounce
the progressive legislation of the Turner Govern-
ment as the cause of the imaginary disaster. And
every reactionary rag in Australia is eagerly
seizing on the lie as evidence that “fiddling with
Socialism ” is a thing to be avoided. Yet, as a
matter of fact, there was only one year when
Victoria’s population decreased (a decrease long
since much more than made up), and that was in
1896, when Old Age Pensions, minimum wage,
Factory Acts, and such like, had not yet com-
menced ; and as soon as the State began to
“fiddle” with Socialism a vigorous improvement
set in. Certainly Victoria’s population has not
increased so fast as that of some other States
which were spending loan money wholesale, in
order to find work for new arrivals and to attract
population—but no sane person expected that it
would. Here are the hard facts of the case for
the five years up to the end of 1901—the figures
for 1902 not being yet available:
That is bow matters stand as regards the three
large States (large in point of population) of the
Commonwealth. The three small ones compare
in this fashion:
From these figures The Bulletin draws certain
inferences which it presents o Premier Irvine
and his supporters and the reactionary press of
Australia in general:
(1) It is not “ too much fiddling with socialism” that
has caused the population of Victoria to stop increasing,
for it hasn’t done so ; Irvine first invented an imaginary
disaster, and then meanly charged his opponents with
being the cause of it. _
(2) The only year in which Victoria’s population didn t
increase was IS96 —before Old Age Pensions, Minimum
Wage and other socialistic horrors were heard of.
(3) Under the semi-socialistic regime of the last two or
three years Victoria has been growing faster and faster.
Irvine is trying to undo the policy under which this
result has been schieved, and get back to the old stagna-
tion.
(4) No other State is showing such genuine progress as
Victoria has done in the last three years under its Mini-
mum Wage policy and the other democratic legislation of
the Turner Government—in other words, no other State
did so little at making artificial employment for its
people out of loan money and depended so much on its
own resources. Victoria, in 1901, made almost as good
progress as N.S.W., while borrowing, in proportion to
population, only one-fifth as much, and despite the fact
that it has only one-fourth the space on which to accom-
modate new population.
If Premier Irvine didn’t know how things stand,
then his ignorance is a publio disgrace. If he did
know, then lie invented a bogus calamity; he
falsely accused his political opjioneiits of being
the authors of the calamity that didn’t exist; and
he delil>erately set to work to undo the democratic
policy which has done so much to lift Victoria out
of the slough to which Toryism formerly reduced
it, and deliberately conspired to brine back the
old, lamentable order of things. Either wav,
Irvine ranks as a delusion of the first magnitude.

The Writing 1 on the WalL
London, Friday.—Mr. H. W. Witaox, the assistant
editor of the Dailt Maid, is writing a series of articles
in which he anticipates an Australian crisis exceeding
that of 1393. The predicted crisis Mr. Wilson attributes
to perpetual borrowing, the policy of hindering immi-
gration, and maintaining a fictitious wage rate, and the
drought. s
The writer of the articles estimates that for the nie
years ending in March, 1904, £11,000,000 will have been

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were bent on blood and glory
And to win a name in story,
So we gripped our bag and bay’net and we joined
the squalid row;
And when all the fight was over,
And we thought to dwell in clover,
We were told to lump and leave it and make
ready for the Chow.
On the blood-red veldt and valley
Where we saw defeat and rally,
Where we drove the DoppePs Kaffir and we stole
the Hopper's cow,
There’s a blessed prospect looming,
When the Rand has got a-booming,
And the white man and the black man make their
congd tc the Chow.
Slanting eyes and fla; ' jned feature
Are the sign of yonder creature
Whom the tribe of Mose and Levi set on high to
worship now;
And they shout his praises madly,
And they bid us: “ Hail him gladly—
Kiss the ground, O Celt and Saxon—Way before

expended on unproductive works. The retrenchment
he says, has been confined to the national defences
while indebtedness has been incurred in maint linine in
comfort and affluence the worker, who regards the new
comer merely as a competitor for wages within Ins loam
maintained paradise.
Despite deficits, continues the writer, a policy of prodi
gal relief works and old age pensions has been adopted
Australia ought to have grown and developed like a
giant, but the birth-rate is steadily declining, and the
loss bv emigration during the past two years has ex.
ceeded the gain by immigration.
The Socialists have swayed the past policy, concludes
Mr. Wilson, and they are now seen to be steerin-Aus-
tralia to not-distant and not-uncertain ruin.— Cablegram,
The London Daily Mail is a loud, blatant and
not always well-inlormed organ ; it is also a long
way off, and if its curse and execration stood alone
as a solitary episode it would matter very little
But the above cry is only part of a great and
increasing chorus; and if the Labor party of
N.S.W., which is the one at which the anathema
is specially directed, fails to note the signs
of the times, and is unable to recognise that
the hour for coming in out of the wet has
arrived, it is too slow a party for this very
swift world. Of course the accusations of the
Daily Mail are largely lies, and most inartistic
lies at that. For the last two years Australia lias
gained a little by immigration ; it was in 1898-
18119-1900 that it lost population by excess of
departures. Since Australia commenced to
“hinder immigration,” as the foolish Wilson
man puts it, it has had more immigration than it
was blessed with for a long time previously. The
maddest borrowing, in proportion to population,
has been in Westralia where there is practically
no Labor or “socialistic ” party, and the maddest
borrowing in Westralia was five or six years ago,
when the old Tory crowd was in sole and absolute
possession. The biggest debt jier head is in
Queensland, where the lories are m sole jiossession
even now ; and the worst borrowing days in all
the States save N.S.W. were the days' of Tory
Government. But with all deductions Australia
is surely on the road to ruin ; and while it is an
unholy lie to assert that Labor legislation is the
cause, the fact remains that the N.S.W. Lalior
party—the only one in Australia which really
runs the Government to any great extent—care-
fully puts itself on financial matters in the worst
and most villainous possible light. This is its
record :
By its policy of giving support in return for concessions
it has been the power that has kept successively the
Parkes, Reid, Lyne and See Ministries in otiice.
In return for democratic measures conceded by suc-
cessive Premiers the Labor Party has voted for, supported,
winked at and condoned the account-faking, borrowing,
defloits and political swindles of Parkes, Kkid, Lynk and
See successively (Dibbs, the only financially clean man to
hold office during the era of the Lalior party, had
generally that party’s bitter hostility). The Labor party
didn’t originate any of the swindles, yet it has drifted
into the unenviable position of being the only party
which has condoned the frauds of every Government in
succession.
When it secured the inestimable boon of Old Age
Pensions it made the unspeakable mistake of not insisting
that some special source of revenue should he provided to
meet them, or taking care that sufficient economy should
be observed to provide the money for them. Therefore,
though the deficit is not much more regular now than it
used to be, the Labor party gave its opponents opportunity
to charge every deficit that now comes along to the Old
Age Pension policy. When the accounts show a shortage
of £400,000 it is the easiest thing in ihe world to say that
but for the £500,000 spent on Old Age Pensions there
would be no shortage.
The Labor party uas never made financial honesty or
solvency or self-reliance a plunk in its platform. It has
never seriously protested against the dishonesty of any
Government, or withdrawn its support from any Govern-
ment because it was running the State to" financial
destruction.
It would probably govern the State on reasonably
honest lines if it got into power. But by its decision
that no members who have not been elected on the
direct Labor ticket shall be allowed to join it, it has
deliberately cut itself off from all chance of getting into
power for many years. It has decided to remain a third
party, giving support in return for concessions. And the
support it always has to give is support of the policy of
huge loans, hopelessly unprofitable public works, deficits,
misappropriation of the trust funds, misappropriation of
the rents of unpaid-for properties, squalid struggles to
raise money at almost any cost to keep the boom going,
and every kind of financial dirt and dishonesty. The
concessions are being bought too dearly. If the party
decided to take in every man who would join it, it might
get into office itself and secure democratic legislation on
clean terms.
And the result ! Well, the result is just this :
The Labor party did not originate a single
item of all the disgraceful series of financial
dodges and swindles that have dragged the good
name of New South Wales in the dirt. But both
the other parties are prepared to swear that they
were driven to these evil emir es by the pressure
of the Labor party. If their boom bursts, and
they are forced to become honest for lack of any
more loan or trust funds to be dishonest with,
they will probably coalesce. They will throw
aside the Lalior party because, jointly, they will
have a majority without it, thanks to its policy of
refusing to let any of the members of the other
parties join it. There will be no more concessions
m return for support, for the support won’t be
required. The coalition will point out that the
era of (compulsory) honesty started when the two
old parties shook off the malign influence of the
Labor element. And the Labor party will
be a thing of scorn, a cloth for dirty
hands and a mat for dirty feet ; for the
venal daily press will hammer its lie into
the public mind till a very large section of
the public will believe it from sheer reitera-
tion. It has allowed the other parties to
be fraudulent, and it is easy enough for them to
profess that it forced them to be so. There must
bean Honest Party in N.S.W. soon, because all
the trust funds and sinking funds have lieen
annexed, and loans are growing more and more
difficult to obtain ; and one crowd at all events will
soon have to be at least partially honest under
compulsion. Then the other crowd will lie lalielled
the Dishonest Party. The Honest Party will be
the one that gets there first, .fudging by all
present appearances the Labor men won’t get
there first.

Yes-No.
In his “strong speedi ” at Melbourne (a speech
delivered to a moderate and not specially enthusi-
astioaudience, though the Sydney importing papers
represented it as a huge gathering that went com-
pletely off its head with approbation), George
Kkid ranged himself as definitely on the side of
Toryism as was possible for such a persistent rail-
sitter and wobbler in the crooked paths of un-
certainty, His cries about the Australian Govern-
ment being under “Trades Hall domination” was
calculated to make the 48 Rich Landlords of
Victoria take him to their joint and several
bosom, so far as two suoh bosoms could meet by
reason of the vast protuberance below. In a
general way the speech was the same old Yes-No
production as usual, its principal shocks and
grievances lieing these:
(1) The Australian Government was wrong In enforcing
the law (a law which Gborob Reid didn’t oppose, and
which his party cordially approved) in the case of the six
hatters. Its conduct filled George with “derision and
contempt.” (What he would have done In Ba&iom'B
position he didn’t explain.)

Gov eminent does a thing, as in the case of the Post Office,
or leaves it undone, as in the case of the High Court, or
partly does it, as in the case of the Federal capital, it is
equally wrong. r
(7) Also the Barton Government has committed the
shame and iniquity of promising a Federal Conciliation
and Arbitration Bill, which is another evidence of Trades
Hall domination, and another gross outrage on Fat.
And then this fine old crusted falsehood (if the
bydney 1 kleukaph s report can bo relied upon)
winds up the show :
The promise of old-age pensions Mr. Reid alluded to as
a cruel and abominable attempt to deceive tlie people.
Aliinslers knew ttiat tlie financial sections of the Con*
stitut'ori made such a scheme at present impossible.
( ‘Hear, hear.”)
There are just two weak points in this “cruel and
abominable ” slander. One is that no such promise
was ever made; the other is that, as tlie Federal
Government has unlimited powers of direct taxa-
tion, the promise, if it had been made, wouldn’t
be constitutionally impossible. The chief difficulty
m the way is that the Reid party fought so hard to
reduce the Federal revenue that it succeeded in
preventing tlie Australian Government getting
enough money to pay Old Age Pensions with.
And tlie ptesumable reason why this was done
is that George Reid is himself an opponent
of Old Age Pensions—at least, if the fact that he
never granted them during his five years of office
in N.S.W. counts for anything, he certainly is.
During these five years he made, if the writer re-
members aright, certain cruel and abominable
attempts to deceive the people into a belief that
the pensions might be coming by speaking kindly
of the idea, but the actual cash never eventuated.
It would have been necessary to levy duties on
the rich importers of York-street, or to put an
extra tax on the huge and bloated estates of the
Australian Agricultural Co. to get the money,
and Mr. Reid wasn’t built that way,

Premier Irvine’s Non-Responsibility.
The Victorian Parliamentary committee which
sat on the case of Lands Minister M'Kenzie spent
a very few days in arriving at its decision. In
view of the things which that eminent squatter
admitted in a perfectly ofT-hand way, there was,
in fact, very little to decide. M'Kenzie acknow-
ledged, quite candidly, that lie applied to his own
department for land in a name that wasn’t his
name, and obtained the land ; that he took up
land through his own department at a very
moderate rental in drought-time, and sub let it
to starved-out farmers at a profit ; also, that his
son applied to his department for laud, or an
application was made on his behalf, in a name
which wasn’t his own, and he got the land. The
committee had merely to decide that the
spectacle of a Minister virtually granting laud
to himself and his son under such conditions
didn’t look wholesome. Tlie Irvine Govern-
ment, however, doesn’t go down with M'Kknzie
—there is no foolishness of standing by a
fallen colleague about that combination, and it
dropped him with much velocity—but an nm-ient
and fish-like odor hangs nlxiut the Government
premises, none the less. Men are judged by tlie
company they keep, and Irvine lias been asso-
ciated with M'Kknzie and is associated with
Bent, and it is difficult to say whether the land
dealings of tlie former or tlie manners of tlie latter
are tlie more objectionable. Premier Irvine,
however, shakes off all responsibility for his lost
colleague in this cavalier fashion :
The Premier contended that tlie responsibility of the
Ministry as a body was not involved. It had loin* been ■
recognised principle that when a Minister was attacked
on a matter of personal administration, and the Minister
resigned, the responsibility of tlie Government as a whole
was not involved.
It would be interesting to know when, or where,
or by whom that remarkable principle was
“recognised.” Tlie Cabinet is supposed to be
the creation of the Premier, and the Premier is
supposed to be responsible for its doings in its
Ministerial capacity. When a Minister isdropjied
for things done outside his Ministerial capacity
(as Milks was dropped in Tasmania for his doings
as Master Warden of Straltan Marine Board, and
as MUNDKLLA was dropped in England by reason
of the very unsavory breakage of a company
which lie helped to direct; the Premier certainly
isn’t responsible. He can’t lie expected to wholly
sujiervise the private life of I.is colleagues. But if
they may run choir several departments in a
way that is a disgrace to honest administra-
tion, and the Premier, when some private
member drags their doings into the light, may
clear himself of all resjxmsibility by dropping
them, then the Premier is under no obligation
to choose respectable and trustworthy sut>or-
dinates; lie is not required to see that they
remain respectable and trustworthy, supposing
they were apparently so at the beginning ; he is in
no way responsible for the honest manag. meat of
the country’s affairs—in fact, every department of
tlie State save his own may be utterly corrupt, and
he may still goon his incompetent way without
any serious trouble. In suoli a case it appears
very little use having a Premier. The strong
point of tlie Irvine Government was that it
undertook to supply Victoria with “ honest
Government.” It now appears that it only un-
dertakes to supply a Government that will be
honest till it is found out. The Bulletin lias no
faith in the present system ; it believes in the eleo-
tion of Ministers by the House, and their indivi-
dual responsibility to the House. But that system
hasn’t arrived yet. At present the Premier selects
the Ministers, and Irvine cla.ims that he isn’t
responsible for the Ministers he selects. If he
isu’t, then who is?

A Lugubrious “Native.”
Even Nooze letter:

Thursday enlighten us. What a shocking lot ol wo<•den-
head. d people w of this Stale must he to stand this kind
of thing—this complete domination of ourselves anil our
affairs by Melbourne, forsooth ! As a native ol thie
State, it surjwsses my understanding lliat stub an
apathetic, tame, servile, and sleepy crowd could bate
sprung from the soil of New South Wales. Hut for the
fact that family and business ties hold me fast to
my native land, 1 would shake its dust from my
feet, and seek Patagonia or Timbuctoo In preference,
realising that I live amongst a |>eople who seem utterly
soulless, utterly indifferent to sell esteem, and utterly
devoid of all that goes to make on individual or a nation.
We are practically handed over, lock, stock, and barrel,
to Melbourne, and noliody cares ; not even the members
of our State Parliament trouble themselves in the
slightest. ’Tis Melliouriie that has to be oonsulted tf
some small Customs matter lias to be detirmined, or a
postal inquiry lias to lie made, and so on ad infinitum.
Ilow long, O ! Lord, how long? it is just what many of
us foresaw when that curse of New South Wales, Federa-
tion as it was and is, was thrust at us. A loss of liberty,
a subjugation of our entire affairs to a people who have
never been overscrupulous, just, or friendly.
The industriously sown newspaper poison is soak-
ing in, and poor “Native” goes into printed
hysterics over the mere fact that an important
piece of _ work has to be referred for approval to
the Ministerial head of the department, who hap-
pened to he in accursed Melbourne, where N.S.W.
men are running the biggest jwrt of the Federal
business, and bossing both the Government and
Opposition, and getting much more than their
fair share of Federal office. Most likely
“Native” had visions of hordes of top-hatted
conspirators rushing down Col I ins-street to some
secret vault with skulls over the door, and “ to
hell with N.S.W.” painted on a coffin in the
centre, and the fate of the Red fern exchange
lieing decided thereat. Yet, if some ini|K>rtaut
piece of Australian legislation is refused the
Royal assent 10,000 miles away, no wild, woolly-
headed “ Native ” arises to jaunt out ** our loss of
liberty and subjugation to a |jeoj>le ” that used to
British but is now largely naturalised Polish Jew.

Mr. Kingston and the Criminals.
That correspondent (possibly in the importing
i iterest himself) who wrote to the Sydney JD.T.
the other day :
My own humble opinion Is that a Minister for Customs
Is absolutely unnecessary, and has'now been proven a
mistake
put the case for the importers bluntly and
honestly. If the idea could be extended, and the
criminal courts and gaols altogether abolished also,
then the dishonest of other sections of the com-
munity would be profoundly obliged. And when it
comes to obliging dishonesty and crime there is
no logical reason why concessions should be
granted to the importing interest alone. But
the Australian press is generally so bound up
with the importing interest that it views with
something more than toleration the complaints of
dishonest people, who object to being prosecuted
for swindling the btate, when it would utterly
refuse to countenance the plea, say, of burglars,
that the jxdice should be abolished, so as to secure
them immunity in their predatory calling. It is
left to The Bulletin to say—and this paper has
no qualms in saying it—that Mr. Kingston is, if
anything, too considerate to the swindling im-
porters whom he has brought to book. They have
been prosecuted and fined ; many of them should
have been put behind the spikes and gaoled for
forging invoices and obtaining money by false pre-
tences. The moans (which the Freetrade pajiers are
unprincipled enough to countenance) of peojile
who have been trying to rob their country are
the finest testimonials which an honest Minister
could wish for—especially when they come, as in
the present case, from the “ respectable,” silk-
hatted, frock-coated persons of the community,
who have in the past been led to exject that their
riohes made a safe shield for them from the law.
It is a fine thimg to know of a Minister who is
courageous enough to punish even the “ respec-
table ” offender fearlessly.
Srr»NRT E. News, not as a matter of sarcasm,
but quite seriously':
From Tamworth cmnes the news that, at the sale of
the I’eel Itiver Co.’s land—when 250 acres were offered in
small fanes, ranging from 14 acres down to 2 acres—the
land realised an average of £4O an acre. For some blocks,
the local record price of £Ol 10s. jier acre was obtained.
It will astonish many |>eo|>le to find that we have any
land rich enough to support farmers on such small areas,
and the country is to be congratulated on the fact that
the Peel Itiver Co. is allowing some of the best land in
Australia to be put into cultivation.
The country is to l>o “congratulated ” that it has
allowed this merciless n.otiojxtly to lock up its
land and finally conijiel the farmer to pity the
highway-robiierv |>riee of £-10 j>er acre for it! No,
tl>e country anil its Government is to lie cursed
for its criminal folly in not having, years ago,
imjxxsed such a tax on big estates as would
have forcer! the Peel River Co., and other great
land-inonopolists, to sell at £5 an acre, or less.
The unfortunate agriculturists who have l>een
forced to pay such extravagant prices to get back
from the P.R Co. the land which the co. got for
next to nothing, will never he able to make a
decent return for their expenditure: if they con-
trive to exist they will be lucky.

It i 3 up to someone in the Victorian Assembly to
ask Iceberg Irvine whether he considers that the
House of 48 Fatmen has cut out any of the
“essential features” of his Constitution Reform
Bill. The strong-weak, sidelong man who rules
the destinies of Kyabram-Victonn was always
talking largely, when the Bill was before the
Assembly, about “ the essential and vital features
of the measure.” He was very careful to, how-
ever, conceal what features his weak-strong Govt,
regarded as “essential and vital,” but this dodge
cannot be kept up longer. The House of 48 big
waistbands lias knocked the Reform Bill to dust
and rugs. The 48 have treated what Irvine lias
been prating aliout as the will of the j>eoj>le, r -
presented by his big majority, with contempt;
they have jumjjed on the said will of the people
as embodied in the Bill with all the weight of
their flat, fat feet. All the finality clauses provid-
ing for a double dissolution and a joint sitting the
Council threw out without a moment’s hesitation.
Its 48 property Solgns tossed overboard Women’s
Suffrage by two to one. They declined to reduce
their own numbers to fewer than 42 ; they kept
up the property qualification for members of the
Council to £5O annual value, and the qualification
of voters for the Council to £l5 annual value. In
fact, everything that Liberals in Victoria have
been fighting for during the last 20 years has been
pitched out of the Bill with great heartiness. Of
course the Leg. Council fell in with the Govt.’s
proposal in regard to the publio servants’ separate
representation and the voters’ certificates. Both
those proposals tend to the restriction of the
franchise, and the Council would dearly love to
go back to the days when Stout Gentlemen got
into Parliament on the votes of half a dozen men
in each electorate,
Tasmania has followed the example of the Kya-
brnni push in Victoria and started a “ Reform
League.” It is an oliscure and back-door species
of organisation whose strongest points are a bitter
desire not to pay taxes whether the country goes
broke for want of revenue or not, a longing to out
down the wages of somebody or anybody or every-
body rather than pay taxes, and a craving to
break the Lewis Government’s window with a
dead cat l)ecause it imposed an income-tax rather
than sweat the public service any further. The
Tasmanian “ Reform ” programme runs thuswise:
The reduction of the salary of future Governors.
The reduction of |>aid .Ministers to three.
The reduction of members of both Houses to 30 in all.
The repeal of the income tax.
An independent inquiry into the Civil Service with a
view to reorganisation.
Expert inquiry into all public works proposals before
Parliament is asked to vote money.
Local responsibility, in whole or in part, for works
which are not of a national character, coupled with effec-
tive local control.
fixing railway rates and fares at such rates as will en-
courage and help the producer.
Such steps as will effect a considerable reduction of
public expenditure.
* Reform ” Leagues seem to hare their basis
m the Fat Man’s intense resolve not to pay in-
come tax whatever hup|>ens. As for the Reform
League which will lay down as its first plank:
this State shall borrow no more money,” it
appears to be as scarce as over.

It is 40 years since that bloated absentee concern,
the New Zealand and Australian Land Co. first
fastened its tentacles on Maoriland. fly the com-
pulsory resumption of the Levels Station by the
Ski (DON Government, the other day, the co. loses
the gem of its possess ons. This big property
practically hemmed in the town of Timaru and has
lam like a vast pork supper on the chest of South-
ern Canterbury for many years. The Tory press of
Maoriland has consistently boomed tbo N.Z. and A.
IW ft sort of hairy Godmother to the country,
i I*y' nte( * to **• ll3 Silver of the State in the
dark days when sheep were a drug in the market
and wool was not worth sending home, because it
inaugurated the frozen meat trade and the butter
export industry. As the co. did both these things
to make its own vast possessions pay handsome
dividends and made great wealth thereby, it is
hard to see where the patriotism came in, and why
Maoriland should wave its hat in the air when the
co. s name is mentioned. It was a persistent
opponent of the democratic policy which has made
Maoriland the best-off State in Australasia; and
it encouraged settlement by selling good land
outright at a handsome profit to itself. The co.
has other valuable properties which might with
advantage be resumed for closer settlement.

Calico importer M'Millan blessed this country
with a newspaper interview before he left, in
which interview he raged picturesquely about the
alleged ill-doings of the Australian Government.
The bitterness of the English importing firm’s
agent spread over much space, but this was the
peroration:—
Unfortunately, the encouragement of independent
enterprise, the opening of fresh channels for the surplus
capital of England, and the still higher ambition to pre-
serve unimpaired in this eastern part of the world the
pluck and resource which we inherited from our fathers,
is about the last aim of a Parliament led by the views of
a small minority, distinctly socialistic and retrograde,
and, curious to say, entirely out of harmony with the
views of the great body of the people.
McMillan’s idea of “ independent enterprise ” is
evidently not manufacturing for ourselves, but de-
pending on Britain for our goods, imported in
British ships and sold to us by M'Millan’s
British firm ; borrowing lots of money; and
regarding Australia as a field to be exjdoited by
“surplus British capital”— not by Australian
capital. And the M'Billion regards this policy
of slavishness, debt and dependence as “indepen-
dent enterprise or says he does.
Victoria, as well as N.S. W., it seems, hos its
newB|Mi|>er-siil>sidy scandal. Interesting informa-
tion re the extent to which the general public of
that State is taxed for the benefit of the Mel-
bourne daily papers has been brought to light by
lb R* Williams, formerly Vio. Minister of
Railways :
When Mr. Williams was in office he abolished the
system of running early-morning paper trains to the
chief provincial centres, but it was re-instated by press-
pandering successors. Five “ news-specials ” leave Mel-
liourne every morning for Bendigo, lJallarat (via Gee-
long), Seymour, Sale, and Bacchus Marsh. They are
provided with fast engines of the T type, so that the run
may lie speedy ; and in the case of Bendigo, for instance,
the wealthy proprietors of the two dailies are enabled to
place their papers in the hands of Bendigo readers
63niins. earlier than would be the case had they to rely
on the first passenger train. A return furnished to the
railway management commission shows that the Aqe and
Leader, Arous and Australasias, and Herald and
Weekly Times pay the dept a total of £3379 ltis. annually.
The cost of running the trains, at 3s. tsd. per mile, is
£47,095 for the 350,384 train miles run annually, and this
sum represents a dead loss to the community, since the
£3379 would be earned anyhow by the ordinary trains for
the carriage of the papers were the specials abolished.
The amount has to be added to by at least £lO,OOO, repre-
senting the difference between the rates paid by the
news]>aper proprietors and other people.
The Vic. public had no idea of what it haq
been paying for the State-bolstered competition of
the Melbourne journals against the provincial
press. But the matter is to be further ventilated
notwithstanding the “great ” Melb. dailies, which
t’other day deliberately suppressed from their
Assembly reports all mention of the fact that
Pkkndkkgast brought the subject of the sub-
sidised city newspapers under notice and quoted
some of the figures given above.
There’s trouble in Maoriland Cabinet. A
number of co-ojierative public works are nearing
completion, and Minister for Works Hall-Jo.nks
has persistently represented that miles.- some estates
were resumed, uj>oti which these men who were
aliout to become unemployed can lie settled, they
will lie thrown on a labor market that is already
rather glutted. But Heavy Duncan, whose idea
of saving the country is to borrow large sums of
money and make roads for the benefit of members
of the Farmers’ Union, paid no heed to his col-
league’s representations. When .lingo Dick re-
turned from Britain he stopped talking about the
settlement of S’Africa for once, and waded in
to settle the impending ti »üble. The Levels
estate was resumed in short order, and now it is
announced that the Flaxbourne estate is to be
compulsorily purchased also. In fact, under the
guise of taking over “the urgent work of the
Lands Department,” Premier Dick has practically
suspended Minister Duncan, but that sad person
refuses to resign, and says he will see a number of
people in Tophet first. Duncan is mostly re-
membered by his vehement denunciation, as un-
patriotic and damaging to the State’s credit, of
the suggestion of a Liberal member, that the
Govt. should take some steps to protect the infant
children of the dairy farmers from their parents’
rapacity. He didn’t condemn the sweating of
children, but he was very strong on the exposer
of it.

“ Fun on the Bristol ” was unburied last
week, at Sydney Criterion, with Johnny in a new
pink frock ; and various songs, more or less new,
were grafted on the Bristol humor, which is now
unmistakably old. The widow who muses pub-
licly on her two dead husbands, and her desire for
a third experiment, is now a very ancient
wheeze. Miss Celia Mavis takes the part
of the one daughter, and Miss Minnie Hooper
of the other. Minnie, by the way, has just
had a gold watch publicly presented to her
by John Sheridan for being ill and dancing
as well as usual under that drawback. A pretty
trifle is the German sketch, performed by John as
a blushing fraulein, also as a wrinkled frau ; he is
assisted by Wentworth and Miss Barlow as one
character apiece. But the strong, firm hand of
managerial authority is requested for Miss Heba,
who enacts a stout German Hans in a close-fitting
velvet costume with a red-ribboned sailor-hat.
In the variety scenes of Act 11. Sydney
Davis is a moderate success in a ballad, “When
King Edward was Crowned,” and Mr. Carden’s
fine notes are allowed some scope in his
part—he has a deep, religious voice, but his
face is otherwise, and suggests the low
comedian whose humor consists in falling fre-
quently off a chair or sitting down on a pie. The
usual choruses by Miss Minnie Hooper and her
train of dancing stewardesses in pale blues and
greens are well received, and the setting for the
saloon of the. Bristol is good.

“The Breaking of the Drought," after an
unusually long run, gives place this Saturday at
Bland Holt’s show place to “The Cotton King.”
The dryness and general dreariness of Australian
interior life will therefore cease to interest the
gallery after Friday, though these cheerful items
may have their theatrical day again. While the
Drought play was on some of those inquiring indi-
viduals who look over the back fence of the com-
munity and pry into its private affairs, approached
Bland Holt and inquired the reason of the mys-
terious dearth of Chinamen in his Paddy’s Market
scene. Bland informed them that he had tried to
engage various genuine Chinkies as supers, and
they refused, as their religion forbade them
to appear on the Klistian stage. Even the
common vegetable John declined to cross the
boards once with his basket. Asked why he did
not “make up” one of his company as a Chow,
Bland replied—“No, that would burlesque the
play.” Yet a tin horse jerks across his stage to
represent the maddened steed escaping from a
bush fire, and that isn’t burlesque !

At Sydney Theatre Royal the “Fortune-
Teller” will cease to reveal a misty and unreliable
future after Wednesday night. The revelation
of the future is always an unsatisfactory business,
but when it is done under the direction of George
Musgrove, there is at least a satisfactory revela-
tion of silken skirt and dainty nether limbs to
accompany it. Upon the departure of the “ For-
tune-Teller,” the Players’ Club will masquerade
for one night. After that, in answer to many
special and urgent requests from parties who are
still at large, manager Musgrove will revive the
“Chinese Honeymoon” for one night only ; and
when it is gone the Lady of the Turquoises will
brighten up the darkness as “Sweet Nell of Old
Drury.” The Bulletin is bowed down with
grief that there are sufficient people in its native
city to secure a revival of the senseless “ Chinese
Honeymoon,” but as Miss Stewart is returning,
the offence will be overlooked for once.

The Royal Comic Opera Co. leaves Sydney
Palace after this Friday night’s performance, and
in saying farewell to it for a while, Sydney will
take a long and, on the whole, regretful leave of
Miss Carrie Moore, who is bound for London at
the close of the co.’s Melbourne season. If it is
Miss Moore’s fortune to strike a little patch of
difficulty in the Cold Country, that probably
would do her quite a lot of good ; still nobody
hopes for such a happening, but will trust that
the “ unlearning ” she has to go through to get
back to her old standard of merit will be by some
pleasant path. Friday afternoon, 20th inst., Mr.
Williamson and the co. give a matinee in aid of
the Drought Relief Fund, when the “Mikado”
will be staged.

“The Wrong Mr. Wright” will begin to
he a source of innocent merriment at Sydney
Palace on Saturday, Feb. 21st. The Bulletin
has already assured the public, on the excellent
authority of its Melbourne representative, that
“The Wrong Mr. Wright” is funnier than
“ What Happened to Jones,” and is convincing
Eroof that a Yankee playwright who knows his
usiness can fill a wholesale order for humor as
well as a retail one. The Willoughby and Geach
Co., which will present Mr. Wright in his wrong-
fulness, is a good one, and the season of farcical
comedy promises well.

A feature at Sydney Tivoli just now is
Wallace Brownlow’s singing. The fine baritone
is in exceptionally good voice (the Brownlow voice
is a delicate affair, and is heard at its best but
seldom), and the fashion in whioh he sings his
two on jhree ballads gives cause for regret that he
left the operatic stage and drifted into variety
business. G. W. Hunter (comedian), some speci-
ally fine biograph pictures, and the musical
Maccann help to make tne Tivoli pleasant.
Jaques Inaudi has taken his arithmetical genius
to another State, leaving the Owe’Sullivan still
unconverted and still oweing.

Anderson’s new yellerdrama at Melb.
Royal is called “ In the Shadow of Night,” and
the calm, collected Willard plays the shadovv.
Willard is a wicked nephew, likewise an evil
cousin, who employs Geo. Carey in making things
look black for Inman. After the guilty pair have
hitched a robbery and a parricide to Inman s
upright character they lure his girl to a petroleum
store, where Willard declares his love for the
third and last time. She prefers death to Willard,
so he ties one rope around the lady, and another
roi>e around Inman (who is dodging the gallows
at the time) and orders Carey to fire the premises.
After which he decides to burn Carey along with
the roped bodies, whilst he (Willard) smokes a
cigarette outside the store. An opportune small
boy averts this cheerful catastrophe. The small
boy crops up every time when required. In the
fourth act Willard throws his unburnt Carey and
the girl into the Thames, but the infant preserver
rescues them from that narrow, tanklike river,
and then Inman’s innocence is proved by a con-
fession which was discovered in a bottle floating
down the tank. “Shadow of Night” appears to
be the product of an amateur drama-builder.
Sometimes the author reveals a tendency to be
brighter than the other people who supply such
dramas to the trade, but, as a rule, he falls below
the average artisan. There are dreary periods
when nothing in particular takes place. Miss
Ada Lawrence and Bert Bailey contribute an
irrelevant comic-relief. J. H. Nunn and L. Dun-
bar are satisfactory minor characters, Miss Guild-
ford is more animated than usual, and Miss
Buckley plays the boy very well indeed. The
rural scenery is rather exuberantly over-colored,
but the store on fire is an effective picture, in
which Carey, Willard and Inman glow to particu-
lar advantage.

Miss Amy Castles and sister Dolly Castles
couldn’t complain of the reception Melbourne
gave to them on Saturday. The Town Hall was
filled by an audience which was markedly enthusi-
astic, and gave as kindly a reception, almost, to
Miss Dolly on her debut as to Miss Amy on her
farewell tour. Miss Freida Miller, Robert Need-
ham, and Charles Rose supported the principals.

The run of “ Zaza ” at the Princess’s will
continue until Feb. 26th, and meanwhile the
announcement of last nights is calculated to bring
along the local girl in fresh abundance. Nellie
Stewart’s perfonnance shows a little exaggera-
tion all round since the outset. It has thrown off
the early restraint of nervousness, as was the case
with her Sweet Nell. The difference between
Zaza in her first two degrees—the positively
loose and the comparatively proper (she takes
great credit for being decently true to one
Bernard) —is not so marked as it might be, but
her rise to the third degree of superlative virtue
is more surprising than ever. The purification of
Zaza would almost justify the management in
sending a party of angels to carry her off to
Heaven in her barouche. Talking of exaggeration,
the unsober behaviour of Zaza’s aunt might very
well be modified. Mrs. G. B. Lewis mars the
effect of her genial old woman character by some-
times bidding for laughter, and even Haroourt
Beatty seems to call public attention to the awful
odor of a bad egg at the breakfast table.

Miss Gracie Emmett is banging her
second husband in a motherly manner at the
Opera House ; also, Coleman is still there, and
the Montrose acrobats returned last Saturday for
five nights only, and Ernest Fitts has brought his
impressive baritone voice to fill the gap which
Brownlow left behind him. The lightning calcu-
lator, Jacques Inaudi, introduces his abnormal
capacity to Melbourne notice on Saturday.

The Bijou is to open again next Saturday
(19th) under the management of G. H. Hunt.
Miss Maud Williamson’s version of “The Chris-
tian,” which differs from a previous dramatisacion
of Hall Caine’s yarn, will be produced, with Miss
W. as Glory Quayle, Alfred Woods as the stormy
John, and a company whose names appear in the
advt.

The late “Billy” was Australia’s most
popular comedian in what are likely to be known
for a long time to come as the “great” years
of theatrical business—the years of the original
Williamson, Garner and Musgrove firm, which
was the parent of the B. and B. opposition. M, !o-
drama had not begun to be associated with ad \ or-
tisement curtains when “Billy” came to this
country. It was in the winter of ’B6 that the l.ow
little man from London joined the Firm’s mighty
melodrama co., and made his first appearance at
Melb. Royal in “Hoodman Blind,” an unlu ky
drama written by H. A. Jones and Wilson Barre tt.
Soon afterwards Titheradge, the leading man of
the co., broke the monotony of the melodrama
Season by taking a benefit as “ Hamlet,” the first
gravedigger being Elton. Little Billy was essen-
tially a cockney comedian. H. J. Byron’s “Blow
for Blow ” was revived to give him a chance as
Charley Spraggs, and he played a cockney clerk
in “The Crimes of Paris,” when handsome Phil
Beck joined the co. The lurid improbabilities of the
“ Crimes of Paris ” were spoken of with horror in
well-regulated families—in 1886. To-day the same
horror at Melbourne Royal would he praised for
its comparative literary merits. Elton retired
from the melodrama co. after the run of “ The
Crimes,” and G. W. Anson took his place. There
was a big production of “Human Nature,” with
a notable cast Titheradge, Anson, Herbert
Flemming, Phil Beck, Harry Jewett, J. R.
Greville, Harry Taylor, Maggie Knight, Jenny
Watt-Tanner, Emma Chambers, Mrs. Woold-
ridge and others who understood their busi-
ness. A little while later Tith. and Anson
joined the B. and B. co., and Elton started to
make his appearance in comic opera. Within the
next few years he had a few reappearances
in drama—“ Harbor Lights,” “Silver King,’
“ Hands Across the Sea” —also he took the name
part in “That Doctor Cupid,” a fantastic comedy
which fell flat; and he played the deaf boat-
builder in “The Guv’nor.” But it was as the
Firm’s comic-opera comedian that he scored his
chief successes and drew his biggest salary.
Towards the end of his reign, when business had
slackened, it was said that Elton’s salary for a year
wasaslatge as the Firm’s income. He had to
make his popularity by degrees, like his successor
George Lauri. “Billie Taylor,” the first opera in
which Elton appeared, was not a particular
success. Later in ’B7 he played Gaspard, the
miser, in “Cloches de Corneville,” then came his
bilious King Gama in Gilbert and Sullivans
“Princess Ida” (almost a failure as Gil.
and Sul. operas go) and then as Lurcher (of
“ Dorothy ”) he became a prime favorite. Between
his first Lurcher performance and his last
big hit, as Polydorein “ The Old Guard,” a period
of four years, little Billy Elton always had the
public vote. Nobody professed to be tired of him.
He had a good variety of character parts —the
tattered, petty larcenist in “Erminie,” the
political schemer in “Papita” (“my excellent
friend Bombardos”) the Duke in “The Gon-
doliers,” and the jester in “Yeomen of the
Guard.” It seemed as though Australia would
never forget the popular funny man who went
away in ’92. But when he returned with the
“Morocco Bound ” Co. in ’94 he had lost his grip
of the public. He couldn’t make that rather
feeble production go, nor was he a “draw” in
farcical comedy at Melb. Bijou. The glory of
little Billy had departed. And now Billy himself
has gone from theatrical life for good. Elton,
Charlie Ryley, Flora Graupner and Violet Varley
—they were all of them in the original “ Old
Guard ”in 1891—all gone. Three in the grave,
and one mentally d»*»d.

At Adelaide R..yai the "Dick Whitting-
ton ” panto, from Her Majesty’s, Melbourne, is
imminent. Alfred Dampier has finished an un-
usually long run, mostly remarkable for the
“ local color ” pervading it. After a brief relapse
into a story of some Parisian stranglers (who do
their strangling unpleasantly under the public
gaze) he ended with “The Bush King,” and the
old reliable “His Natural Life.” The co. has
shown some good acting, young Alfred Dampier
in various character parts being particularly
notable. At the Tivoli, Seeley and West have at
last arrived from London by the devious route of
Perth and Broken Hill. The net-ball players are
popular, the combined sport attraction and sex
attraction being nicely calculated to appeal to the
feelings of Adelaide. Unfortunately the alleged
Victorian team has been able to squash the so-
called S.A. girls, and this naturally causes the
barrackers pain.
The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The Australian Deposit «nd Mortgage Bank
(Melbourne) showed, for the half-year to 31st December,
1902, the best results it has achieved for a very long time.
Even then, however, the earnings were insufficient to pay
the miserably small dividend of 1 per cent, on preference
shares (nothing on ordinary shares), and, as the manage-
ment insists on paying that burlesque dividend, the very
humble reserve (or, rather, alleged reserve, for both it
and i large amount of the capital have been really swal-
low tup by depreciation, and exist only in name) is still
fur her reduced. Beginning from the partial cleaning
up -u 1896, things have progressed thus :

Dec., 1902 .. 1959 1 „ „ 2793 834 9,499
The earnings represent Bs. sd. per cent, per annum on
the shareholders’ nominal funds (capital £920,048, and
reserves £10,333) as they stood at the commencement of
the half-year. In these circumstances, it is supremely
ridiculous to profess to pay a dividend of any kind.
The A.D. and M. Bank’s capital consists of
£558,655 in £5 preference shares and £363,639 in ordinary
shares. At the half-yearly meeting the chairman made
the remarkable statement that if the assets were written
down to what he regarded as present value, the prefer-
ence shares would be worth £3 each. What the value of
the ordinary shares may be, or whether the preference
shares are supposed to be worth £3 each after the ordi-
nary capital is written off, doesn’t appear. Anyhow, the
A.U. and M. Bank seems to be taking 1 no active steps to
write down capital to present value. Its properties
are mostly vacant lands which produce little
or nothing, and which must cost something
considerable in rates, but no very active steps
appear to b« taken to realise these properties.
A very small new business is being: done, current accounts
standing at £28,078. The bank has £61,504 cash on hand,
as well as nearly £12,000 in Board of Works securities,
and the chairman complains of the difficulty of *’ getting
investments for the moneys in hand at a payable
rate of interest," and says the directors “ are
thinking of asking the shareholders for an exten-
sion of lending powers.” Considering that the bank
oan buy up its own £6 preference shares at about 155.,
at which rate, if the 1 percent, dividend is intended
to be maintained, they would yield over 6£ per cent., to
say nothing of the fact that every share thus purchased
would leave a margin of £4 ss. towards writing off depre-
ciation, there should be no difficulty about investing a
little loose cash. The £12,000 invested in Board of Works
securities, if thus invested, should leave about £50,000
to write off losses, and this margin should cover the loss
on the realisation of a whole lot of land.

The Silverton Tramway Co. (Broken Hill,
N.S.W.) did not make so good a thing out of its splendid
monopoly in 19 (2 as it usually does. In 1891 this co. had
a paid-up capital of £l-2,105 (this is as far back as the
documents at writer’s command enable him to trace the
position), and all subsequent additions have been
capitalised profits. In order to show the real position of
the co., and the real profit made by the shareholders, the
capital is reckoned in the following statement at £122,105;
the dividends are reckoned upon that so as to explain
what the shareholders have really received on their
investment; and the capitalised profits are treated as
reserves to show what the accumulations actually amount
to. The amounts written off for depreciation are ex-
hibited separately, so far as they can be traced

The profit is the smallest, and the dividend the smallest
save one, in 13 years. Still the dividend represents 36$
per cent, on the capital as it stood in 1889, and 22J per
cent, on the present nominal capital, as swelled by the
capitalisation of profits. The co. calls its capital £197,806
and its reserves £63,226.
There is one feature about the Silverton Tram-
way Co.’s management that the State Railway Depart-
ments would do well to imitate—the steady writ ng-down
of the value of track, bridges, buildings, engines, and
other rolling-stock, out of earnings, to cover deprecia-
tion. The State is oblivious, as a rule, to this simple
business idea, and practically everything that it has con-
structed with borrowed money, even if it is worn to the
last stage of dilapidation, or if it has disappeared from
the face of the earth, is still set out as an asset worth its
full original value. This is a way of doing things which,
if practised long enough by a private co., would get
somebody into gaol. The impossibility of putting the
State in gaol has its advantages, certainly—but it also
has its drawbacks.

The Equity Trustees, Executors and Agency
Co., Limited (Melbourne) shows a considerable falling off
in earnings as compared with the extra-prosperous last
half-year, though good progress is still being made. In
previous notices in this column “ bonus to staff ” has been
shown separately, as a special outgoing, along with the
dividend. As this bonus, however, seems to have become
an annual item of expenditure, like salaries, it is in the
following statement deducted from gross profits :

Despite a decline in the earnings, they represent over 12
per cent, on capital, which is as good a figure as any body
of shareholders should ask for. There is nothing special
to mention about the accounts, save that this concern,
like many others in the same line, doesn’t differentiate
between commission earned and interest on its own in-
vestments. This is a bad habit, because some day the
shareholders may be very anxious to know what return
their investments are yielding. At present these are
mostly State and municipal securities which are above
suspicion, but the Equity T. E. and A. Co. may, in time,
acquire a lot of investments which aren’t above suspicion,
and then the information will be interesting.

Mr. Mephan Ferguson, of Melbourne, reports
that there has been a great improvement in the general
outlook of the engineenng business since the new' year
started, and that his pipe making works in Melbourne
and Perth are working full-handed. Amongst the orders
now being executed at Footscray works is one for 7 miles
10 chains of 18in. diameter light steel spiral-riveted pipes
for the Victorian water supply ; and at Perth works a
contract is in progress for over 6 miles of lOjin. diameter
spiral-riveted pipes, flanged joints, for the Greenbushes
Tin-Mining Syndicate. About two miles of these pipes
are to stand a test pressure of 8001 b. to the square inch.*

It is not generally known that in the treatment
of ore as much of the valuable minerals is often lost in
the tailings as is saved by the appliances. This is due
in most instances to the inefficient machines used and
the difficulty in saving the fines and slimes. The best
machine to treat the latter classes are Luhrig Vanners.
These machines are in successful daily use in the principal
gold, galena, copper and tin mines in Australia arid
Tasmania, proving their superiority over other so-called
slime machines. Messrs W. & J. Lempriere, 506 Little
Collins-street, Melbourne, are the general agents, and full
particulars can be obtained from them.*

Ore without sulphides in which the gold values
are finely dissemated throughout the gangue is one
amenable to evanidation or chlorination. Should this
ore contain sulphides it could not be so simply treated.
It is now recognised to be good practice to first concen-
trate out the sulpherets on Wilfley Tables and to treat
the tailings thus cleaned by the proper lixiviation process.
Should the ore be a telluride that would require previous
roasting the tendency to “head” or “shot” in the
roasting is surmounted by passing the leached pulp over
Wilfley Tables, by which the values too coarse to be dis-
solved by the lixiviation process are concentrated,
together with any unroasted ore, sulphides or foreign
matter. Illustrated catalogues of the Wilfley Table, with
valuable notes on ore dressing, can be obtained from the
Austral Otis Company, South Melbourne, the sole

A casual reference made by Lvne in Wesfrnlia.
to the payment of part of the Australian interest bill out
of borrowed money has roused a storm of indignation
and all manner of people wear an air of injured innocence
and ask why Long Will,am dare utter such a slander
Yet, despite all this bogus indignation, Lyne spoke the
solemn truth. Taking N.S.W. as an example :It has had
15 deficits in 20 years, or thereabouts, and they have
been made good by borrowing—from the trust funds or
other sources. Some part of the general expenditure is
almost always being met out of loans, and it is lust as
fair to assume that it is part of the interest bill as that it
s part of anything else. If it isn’t part of the interest
that is met out of loans, then it is probably part of the

Maori land is floating a £1,250,000 loan in
London at 3 per cent, and will get, on the terms it has
made with the underwriters, about £92 for every £lOO.
In other words, for the sake of pa3'ing a lower nominal
interest than its credit can stand, it pays £100,009 of the
interest out of the loan itself. Discount on a loan issiied
at a low nominal interest rate is simply so much interest
paid out of borrowed money. Maoriland’s loan boom,
which began to be had again 'about 1898, and which grew
to insane proportions in 1901-2 is going on gaily.

In setting down the deficit at only £495, this paper, it is
almost certain, takes a too favorable view of the situation,
but as it is impossible to say exactly how much
too favorable that view is, the matter may pass.
The co. reckons that it has reserves amounting to
£14,505 (Plant Renewal Reserve, £9759 ; Waterloo
Lease Reserve, £3000; and undivided profit, £1755.) But
as the assets, which represent these alleged accumula-
tions, are merely “ Goodwill, £15,000” (or rather, to use
the co.’s own words, “Parliamentary Rights and Con-
cessions), there is really a shortage, if the writer could
tell (which he can’t) how much the co.’s Waterloo lease
had deteriorated by effluxion of time, and how much
deterioration of plant had to be set against the Plant
Renewal Reserve, he would probably be able to demon-
strate that the real deficit is much larger than £495.

The North Shore Gas Co. suffers from a trouble which
afflicts many other concerns in this country. Between
June and December, 1902, its “Special Reserve Fund”
increased from £5433 to £7933, without a word of ex-
planation as to where the other £2500 came from. It was
transferred from no visible account whatever, nor was
there any explanation. Apparently this sum just fell
like the gentle gas from heaven, which is in every way an
unsatisfactory kind of accountancy.

B.H. Prop, has a small zinc plant at work on

Most of the Broken Hill zinc processes, lately
much talked of, don t*really produce zinc—the stuff that
sells for £2O a ton. They only produce a “zinc product ”;
that is, they carry on the extraction a step by separating
the metallic from the non-metallic particles, but they
don t separate the zinc from the lead. And it is just
this latter separation which costs the money. A zinc-lead
mixture cannot be conveniently smelted fo’r lead because
the zinc chokes the furnaces ; and it cannot be con-
veniently “ smelted ” in retorts for zinc becaue the lead
destroys the retorts, and for other reasons. The zinc dis-
tillers would therefore probably not pay for much more
than half the metal in the ‘ ‘zinc product ” ; while, if the
co. undertook its own zinc-distilling, the losses and ex-
penses would he correspondingly large.

London Board of Trade’s annual report referred
to the Lake George (N.S.W.) mines, “the history of
which,” it states, “ simply shows the uncertainty of mine
operations, even when conducted under the most capable
management, and with ample capital.” If it is implied
that the all-round management of Lake George was
“ most capable,” Board of Trade shows gross ignorance
of the subject. As far as mining and smelting opera-
tions were concerned, the management was very credit-
able, hut London authorities expressly ordered that
finishing smelting operations should not be conducted at
the mine, or anywhere in the State. It was this bad
financial arrangement of shipping low-grade matte,
which meant “bleeding” at innumerable points, that
was mainly responsible for the collapse of LakeGtoge.
It is a very low grade mine, but in view of the results
from Mt. Lyell there is no reason to suggest that if the
“ ample capital ” had been properly applied it could not
have been made to pay.

The continued steady advance in the value of
copper is regarded'* o a hopeful sign that at least £6O per
ton will be reach* ! Very shortly. That figure, if main-
tained, would put, the industry on something like a per-
manent basis. Already there is talk of re-opening many
of the small N.S.W. mines which were closed down
when the slump took place in December, 1901, but
the difficulty which miners and mine-owners have
to face is the abnormal greed of the smelting
companies. There is really only one smelting co.
carrying on operations in N.S.W. which is prepared
to treat copper on anything like reasonable terms.
If half the money which was fooled away on the
Government metallurgical works at Clyde had been
applied to the erection of smelting furnaces at the Uni-
versity, to be used in connection with the Mining School,
a valuable double purpose would have been served—
students would have had the advantage of practical
demonstration on a working scale, and miners would have
had a chance to get some return on the ore which they
would have supplied.

North Kalgurli (W.A.), seems to have a screw
loose somewhere. In spite of the general improvement
m the market, and of the gaudy reports of the manager
regarding developments, scrip is much easier to buy than
to sell. To allay public doubts the directors have com-
missioned Mr. Jim Henderson, late manager Kalgoorlie
Consols, to make an exhaustive examination of the
property. This will occupy a month to six weeks. The
manager, Henry Nutrnan, who has the reputation of
being a very canny” individual, advised the immediate
purchase of a 10-head mill, but his recommendation is
being held in abeyance pending the result of Henderson’s
examination.

St. George lease, Lawler’s (W.A.), has just

it will turn out, but in W.A. these phenomenal returns

Ivanhoe Junction (W.A.), that ancient and

Known as „ Dwyer’s leases. The purchase price was
30,000 fully paid shares. Property adjoins another
lost proposition, the Ivanhoe South Extended, on
the west, and is quite outside the proved payable belt
On several occasions small patches of promising ore have
been come across, but, judging from past experience, co.
is merely following a will-o’-the-wisp. A new quartz and
ironstone lode averaging 4ft. thick, and worth Bdwts ,
has recently been unearthed at the 250 ft. level, and, on
the strength of this promising (?) development Everything
is rosy-hued. Scr:p is merely a gambling counter.

North Boulder (W.A.), with which is incor-
porated the Bank of England, is at present shifting the
latter co.’s surface equipment to the North Boulder
block, preparatory to making a fresh start. Oo has
£32,500 working capital, besides 85,000 reserve shares,
so is in a good position financially. In the earl y davs
mine produced some patches of very' rich ore, and'dist’ri-
buted £27,500 in divs. The lode from which this ore
was won was followed on the underlay to the Associated’s
western boundary fully three years ago ; since when co.
has been in a chronic state of impecuniosity. From
recent developments in the Oroya it is probable that this
lode, which crossed the N.W. corner of the North Boul-
der, is a continuation of the Brown Hill lode, which is
running much further east than was at first anticipated.
As no payable ore body has been discovered to the east of
this, the outlook for the co. is not rosy, but as co. is run
by an enterprising crowd, varying movements in the
scrip may be looked for. Co. has now 400,000 shares
which fact should not be lost sight of by scrippers.
Croesus South (W.A.), which, owing to its
position next the Brown Hill, was long looked upon as a
really good thing, continues under a cloud. Unfortunately
for the Croesus South, Brown Hill chute dipped south-
wards instead of northwards, and left C.S. in the lurch.
Suggestions for diamond drilling have recently been
mooted, but co. is too short of funds to tackle the job.
Uncalled capital amounts to only £2300, and, as at least
10,000 ft. of drilling at £1 a foot may have to be faced,
collapse, sooner or later, is inevitable. It is a question
for shareholders to decide whether they will ante-up the
money or cut their losses.

Boulder Bonanza and Great Boulder South
(W.A.) are to be prospected by diamond drilling. A year
ago, Frank Gardner told the shareholders of the latter
co. that ore worth 3oz. per ton had been developed, and
that a trial parcel was to be put through at the Lakeside
battery. Since then, nothing has been heard of the pro-
jected cutting, hut recently the property has been allotted
as a dumping-ground for the Perseverance tailings. The
properties are situated immediately south of the Boulder
Main Reef and Hannan’s Star, and are all right as far as
position is concerned, but, unfortunately, the gold ap-
pears to tail-out before reaching them.

107 oz. This brings the total gold won to date up to
23060 z. from 91 tons. Bob Hastie, M.P., must feel very
sad on reviewing these returns, as he held this ground at
the time that the Laborites raised him to the dignity of
their member at a screw of £2OO per annum.

Work at Paddington Consols (W.A.) quietly
pushed ahead at No. 4 level, and a large body of good
grade ore is being rapidly developed. Manager Macfarlane
is hustling all he knows to get the battery going again at
an early date. Before very long the mine will add its
quota of about 2000 oz. to the monthly yield of the State.
With such a lot of mines about to join the list of pro-
ducers it seems safe to predict that the monthly yield will
easily top an average of 200,0000 z.

Island Eureka (W.A.) : Directors in their half-
yearly report refer to “ persistent and detrimental
reports” regarding the mine, and represent that “ the
best answer to these ” is the maintenance of the regular
output. It is stated that the mine, as at present deve-
loped, has three years’ ore reserves in view, but “ it may
become necessary to suspend payment of dividends for a
short time” to do “necessary new works.” The two
statements make a contradiction, which would seem to
justify the detrimental reports.

By gambling wildly as usual, Adelaide is doing its
little best to cripple S. Australia’s newest and most pro-
mising goldfield—Arltunga, up near the cordial warm heart
of the continent. Thus a co. (in which the promoters took
a big slice, both of shares and cash) was over-applied-for
the other day, before even the prospectus was issued,
although what was offered was a “ position ” claim only,
and absolutely untested. And, as usual too, the local
papers help. The field, whatever it may prove to be, is
splendidly situated for breeding wild-cats—it is a long
way off, and moreover it fits in with the superstition
regarding the “unlimited mineral wealth of the interior.”

Miles’ Charters Towers circular, reviewing the
operations of the field for 1902, includes a table showing
what would have been the result of the purchase of 100
shares in each of the principal stocks at the beginning
of the year. The purchase price would have been
£2270 16s. Bd., and calls would have been £47 14s. 2d.,
making a total of £2318 10s. lOd. On the other side, divi-
dends amounting to £475 would have been received, and
the market value of the shares at the end of the year
would have been £2988. The transaction would show a
profit of £1155. equal to 50 per cent, on the money
invested, but were the market value of 20th Jan. taken
instead of the closing prices of Dec. a very much larger
profit would be shown. It is predicted that the divs. for
1903 will show a fair increase. Brilliant P.C. and St.
George may not return as much as they did in 1902, but
other co.’s should make up the difference. Brilliant Ex-
tended, Victoria and Queen, and Day Dawn P.O. should
do better ; Ruby P.C. should make an addition to its
profits, while Band of Hope, Day Dawn Gold Mines, Da\
Dawn Block and Queen Cross should maintain, if not
increase, their total. The annual report of the warden of
the field confirms the high anticipations for 190&

Vesuvius (Charters Towers), which, until a few
months since, was regarded as a most hideous wild cat,
nas lately sprung into prominence on an assumption that
there is a chance of the Queen Cross reef passing through
the lease. Shares have been run up to 235., but it is
obvious that it is purely a gambling operation. The plan
of the underground workings of the Queen Cross mine,
published in Miles’ circular, should dispel the idea that
there is a ghost of a hope that Vesuvius will ever see the
reef. Shares go up and do .vn like a jack-in-the-box from
day to day on reports that the lode in the Queen Cross is
taking a bend towards the Vesuvius, and vice versa. The
lode track is very sinuous, but, taking its general trend
as disclosed in the Queen Cross plan, its rourse will be
well into Queen Central. The latter, on position, looks a
good thing, but the Queen Cross levels have yet a long
distance to go to reach the boundary line, and it will be
a phenomenal chute of pay ore, even for the Towers, if it
extends so far.
* • * *
Mt. Morgan seems destined to maintain its
position as the premier gold mine of the world. The lode
at 750 ft. has been penetrated for 140 ft., and for a distance
of 110 ft. the average value is over an ounce to the ton.
The present market value of the mine is over £4,250,000.
It is quite impossible to estimate its life. It looks as
though it would go on to eternity.

An average of 63 dredges working in Otago and
Southland (II L.) produced 105,7860 z. of gold in 1902,
being an increase of 40,5590 z. over 1901. Divs. totalled
£145,967, or about one-third of the yield. West Coast
dredges, to the number of 44, produced 30,0060 z.
stated that the maximum has probably been
reached in Otago and Southland, where there are no new
dredging areas to be explored ; but extensive develop-
ment of the industry is expected on the West Coast.

Duke of York (Vic.) will always be a historical
stock, inasmuch as it was the medium through which a
few level-headed bookies, having no race meetings at the
time to engage their attention, gave the Melbourne spec-
sellers the nastiest knock they ever received. There has
been a mild flutter in the stock lately consequent on im-
proved mine-prospects, but spec-sellers and the gentle
public having been bitten so badly in the “corner,” are
fighting shy of it. It is understood that the bookies have
no longer any interest in the mine. The shares are now
principally held at Ballarat.

For the first time, this season’s crop of apricots
at Mildura and Renmark, the two Murray irrigation
settlements, will fully satisfy Australian demands for the
; of Lexia raisins, there will be a surplus for export;
and of Sultanas, the crop will be from 500 to 600 tons,
against about 200 tons last year. The other big item in
the irrigation harvest is the citrous fruits (about 86,000
cases as a rule) ; but many of these trees are being rooted
out to make room for vines.
The Indian (Mysore) gold mines are working up
into big figures. Champion Reef has n*w. paid J. Bull
£1,906,801 divs. Last year’s divs. were equal to 105 per
cent, on nominal capital ; for the year before that, 130
per cent. The stone still runs about lfoz., and the tail-
ings are cyanided. There are workings (not on the Reef,
but on neighbors) below 2000 ft. Year’s total for field.

An interesting breach-of-promise ease was
nipped in the bud at Warrnambooi (Vic.) last
week. The parties were Priscilla Denham and
Marcus Oldham. Plaintiff was a domestic servant,
and she sued Oldham for £lO.OOO. The case was
settled ; the young lady pockets £2600 as a salve
Oldham is the young man who, by a series of
extraordinary events, got hold of the money of
that wealthy Silas Harding, of Geelong, pas-
toralist. Harding was a widower when Oldham's
sister called ujxm him as a travelling Ixiok-nvnd.
On the first call she was told by Silas to clear out.
She went away, but returned to the attack later.
On this occasion old man Harding was not feeling
very well. The book-lady got into conversation
with him. She had a sympathetic voice (most
women have sympathetic voices when talking to
marriageable wealth) and convince d the ol 1 hunks
that site was dreadfully pained at his state of
health, and she fired off at him a quantity of ad-
vice on hygienic matters, gathered from the four
comers of somebody’s almanack. The Hauling
took kindly to the advice, bought some liooks, and
invited the lady to come and see him again. She
did, and made such an impression that Harding
next invited her to become his wife. Of course,
she assented, and when he died a year or so after-
wards, Mrs. Harding c-une in for the hulk of his
big fortune. A few years ago she was driving
over one of her station properties when she was
thrown out of her buggy and killed. Marcus, her
brother, inherited the biggest share of her nvmey.
In his boyhood Marcus was printer’s devil in a
little weekly Melb. newspaper office ; he now lolls
in a gorgeous carriage in Collins-st. on all the fine
days of. the year.

Very significant the report of the arrest of
Jones, accused of the Auburn (Sydney) murder.
From “information received” the jxilice ap-
proached a house and there found -Tones “ playing

three women will always, in time, be known to
the police, apart altogether from any question of
a £2OO reward.

SUNDAY-SCHOOL TEACHER (to small pupil): “Yes, Faith and Hope are correct;
but what else is necessary to our happiness?”
SMALL PUPIL (promptly): “ 'Usbands, Miss!”
It is probable that the historic Vaucluse
estate will shortly come under the auctioneer’s
hammer, in which case the family vault of the
Wentworths, where the great William Charles is
buried, will prove an incubus to the descendants
who now own the land. A model red-tiled suburb,
with a gloomy, iron-railed mausoleum as a centre-
piece, will lie a unique, but scarcely a cheerful,
sjieetacle for Mr. Jones when looking out of his
forty-foot frontage villa.
Rev. J. D. Langley, of Sydney, is one of
the best parsons in Australia, but he makes a
serious mistake when suggesting, re old-age
pensions:
that certain reputable citizens who take an interest in
philanthropic movements should be appointed in each
district to keep an eye upon the old people during the
currency of their pensions—a paternal rather than an
official eye. It does not matter what you call them—
“ Guardians of the Poor,” or anything else. . . . These
guardians should each have a small circle of pensioners
under their care, visit each one periodically, giving a
kindly and unofficial word of encouragement, and report
periodically to the Pension Board.
The old-age pension, if it is anything at all, is a
right, the return bv the State to old citizens of
some of the taxes they have paid in their life-time.
Mr. Langley would reduce it to the level of the
English poor-house, with its squire and parson
and guardian, aud other degradations.

Yic. Justice Department has thought
pro]>or to order the release of Mrs. Andersen,
who has suffered nine years’ imprisonment for the
murder of Fraser, and who is now 60 years of age,
on the ground of mercy and her present ill-health.
But the order is not to take effect till the middle
of the year. Why? Surely if the prisoner's ill-
health justifies her release, that release should, to
be really merciful, o|ierate at once. The addi-
tional months within the insanitary walls of a
gaol must, to a shattered woman of GO, be
rather a cruel kind of inercy.

A recent Presbyterian outbreak on
divorce:—
MARYBOROUGH. Monday.
Rev. J. O. Sterling spoke strongly on the question of
m.'vrriage and divorce. Three years’ desertion by man or
wife was sufficient to break the seal of heaven. This
condition of affairs was deplorable, and the result would
be an ai*]>allin.r crop of disasters to the community, for a
man's laws could not with impunity be made to override
divine commands. The churches of the State were op.
posed to our present harmful divorce laws, and had raised
their protest against them, but in vain. They must
combine and unitedly say, “ This thing shall not be
done."
Theoretically this may be all right, but a mere
theory, however carefully it may be fried, is an un-
satisfying victual. To get down to business —will
thecliurchessup|>ort the deserted wife? This world
is a cold place for the woman who tries to hustle
for her own living and the living of her children,
and she wants a divorce, iti most cases, so that she
may marry a man who promises to hustle for her.
Of cour<e. it may prove that the church has trained
the second man as badly as it did the first one,
but in that matter she must take her chance.
Unless the church is prepared to su port her, or
to guarantee that it won't for the future lie such a
hopeless failure in the matter of raising good
hi is I lands, it had better go and hide itself behind
a fence for very shame instead of making a dis-
turbance in a public place.

A Melbourne Hebrew commission-agent
has been convicted of getting a hog uuder false
pretences.— Daily jnijwr item.
A 6uit for divorce on the ground of
desertion is mooted in Melbourne which, if it
reaches the public stage, will set a big ethical
discussion rolling. The ground of complaint is
the alleged unwillingne&s of the wife to bear
children, although she is willing to perform her
marital duties in every other resnect. If, as is
not impossible or even improbable, the courts
hold that, as the principal object of marriage is
*’ to increase and multiply,” three years refusal on
the uart of the wife to fulfil that part of the
marriage contract constitutes constructive deser-
tion ei titling the husband to a divorce, the
decision should have a far-reaching effect on
social life.
Writes “ E.F.” :
The other week somebody complained In
The Bclletdi that the rising generation
of Victorians (».«., Melbournians) are
getting “equipped for the stage”—by a
healthful course of instruction at one
or other of the local schools of dancing
art. It was asserted that the girl
children who figure on the Town Hall
platform at annual “ demonstrations ”
acquire a distaste for domestic life,
an'l must naturally “ turn their eyes
siagewaids.” Seems to me that th’e
alleged danger to the y< u ig in these
amateur dancing displays is purely
imaginary. Anyway, the particular
reference to the Town Hall shows
was unjust, seeing that every private
school trots out the accomplish-
ments of its pupils at least once
a year. Dancing, moreover, is the
one and only theatrical art, so to
speak, which does not bring swollen-
headed novices into o]>en competi-
tion with professional evnerls The

“ Sarah Jones ” : Some one has been asking
whether literary women attract men. They do.
A lady advertised recently in S.M. Herald for a
position where journalistic ability would be of
value, and received five replies. Three of the
respondents wanted her to come and live with
them without any marriage ceremony. Two
wanted to insure her life, but one of the insurance
men also urged her to call at his house any evening
after eight. Being a rash young female she gave
her address in the advertisement, so all these
tieople called personally and looked her over
before submitting their various pro|>oritions ;
therefore, the prujiositions were not made blindly.
Yes. literary women do attract enough
—men aud msurauee agents.

station. He was a tall, pale-faced man, nervous
till he knew you well. I met him at the carriage
door. He was so pallid and shaky that 1 became
alarmed, and asked him if he was ill. He nodded
his head. I prescribed a stimulant, after which
he felt better. “ I had an adventure,” he said.
“ What was it?” I demanded, eagerly. “ I rode
from Castlemaine alone with a woman.” Then I
sat back and roared and laughed, and rang for the
waiter again.
He knew the hog was loaded, when from bondage hard

Old Moses led his people by the shores of tepid Nile.
Us ouriy tail was like the mesh in worldly webs of sin ;
Us meat was flabby, and it took the folks of Judah in.
And Moses knew (for he was wise) the hog by fraud and
stealth
Would undermine the pillars of the Hebrew Common-
wealth.
“ Beware of pork and idols ” —thus spake Moses of the
Kile,
But the hog was lying low, and it was loaded all the
while.
In later days, as Judah ’neath his vine and fig-tree sat,
He wrote down these words of wisdom and he gummed
them in his hat.
There were years of woe in Canaan ; there were years o,
storm and stress;
There were golden days of glory ; there were times of
bitterness.
And Nebat's son built idols in Bethel and in Dan ;
And Persians and Philistines the Promised Land o'er
ran ;
But Salem, burnt and wasted, kept a front to every foe—
And all these troubled centuries the hog was lying low.
Not even when Assyria was raging at their door
Did these stalwart men imagine what the ages had in
store.
They were mighty men in battle—many a foeman’s face
grew white
When Saul or Omrt thundered in the forefront of the
fight.
They broke Edom and Philistia like kingdoms made of
glass.
They took cities, and took captives, and took idols built
of brass.
But no man in their stormy tale the sordid legend wrote
That they took a stranger’s hog upon a promissory note.
He knew the hog was loaded, did the wisest Jew of all,
And the beast has now exploded and caused Israel to fall.
He who fools around the trigger—he who blows into the
gun,
His days are few and sudden and his race is quickly run.
The coroner says briefly that he died by being shot.
And the world is sometimes sorry—and more often it is
not.
But it howls with heartless laughter—laughter grim and
saturnine
When it 6ees a Jew run In upon a charge of taking swine.

THE OLD MAN GROM BRYANT ( who has been wait-

with Mister Davy Jones alloyether, if yer
so blessed fond of him."
The struggle for a boarder ; this is one of
several score of replies to an advt. for a room in a
Sydney suburb -just a plain, ordinary room
Dear Sir,—My mother, Mrs. Fitzpero.v, having noted
your advertisement in this morning’s Herald, has
requested me to write you that she has a nice, newly-
furnished front balcony bedroom, situate in a high atid
healthy location in the best part of Road, and
overlooking one of the most beautiful portions of
Park, with the electric tram passing the door every
minute.
The room is large and light and airy, and furnished
with a new half-tester bed and bedding—with spring
mattrass, mosquito-curtain, etc.- there is a fine plunge
and shower bath upstairs ; you may have a latchkey, my
library will be at your service, and, there being but two
of us in the family, my mother, with the aid of our
excellent domestic assistant, will be able to make your
stay with us as pleasant as the comfort of a well-appointed
English home can supply or suggest.
Although commanding such a splendid prospect as the
——— Park affords, the house is, of course, within the
city boundary limit, and within easy walking distance of
every part. There are no young children or anyone or
anything likely to disturb the quietness and peacefulness
of the place, while each of these things in their own way
combine to make the house and its surroundings very
pleasant and homelike, and to enhance the general com-
fort and convenience.
My mother will be pleased to have you call, and to
quote you what I am sure you will regard as being most
moderate terms, and I am sure also that, upon seeing the
room, and noting the surrounding associations—the high,
healthy location, the wide and beautiful outlook, and tire
nearness of easy access to all parts of the city—you will
not think it worth while or care to inquire further.
Thanking you in anticipation of the favor of an early
call,—l remain, &c.

bird require a vast deal of literary ornamentation
in these times to rope in the casual boarder, and
when he is roped in he wants three meat meals a

A tale of the misfortunes of a Victorian
tourist in Tasmania. During the running of the
Launceston Cup, a couple of weeks ago, a local
farmer suddenly grabbed the throat of a young
Vic. visitor, and accused him of attempting to
pick his pocket. That night the Victorian spent
in a Tasmanian gaol. When Senator Keating,
who had been retained for the defence, arrived m
court, next morning, with a small host of wit-
nesses to prove that accused was thoroughly
respectable, he was flabbergasted to find that the
case was heard half-an-hour before, and that ac-
cused (no stolen property being found on him) had
been sentenced to 14 days’ imprisonment for being
a suspected person in a public place. Keating
then applied for a rehearing, but was refused. He
next moved in the Supreme Court, contending
that a gross mistake had been made, and a writ of
habeas corpus was granted, but, in the meanwhile,
the Solicitor-General telegraphed from Hobart,
ordering the immediate release of accused. By
this time the visitor had spent 13 days in custody.
Half-an-hour afterwards, however, he was again
arrested on the same old charge, but, within a few
hours, another order came from Hobart again
ordering his release. After that, he made a
sprint for the nearest boat, before the energetic
Launceston cops had recovered their breath.
The first conviction (for which he spent 13 days
in gaol) has since been quashed by the Full Court.
This vaguely reminds the writer of a case in which
Ward Hunt, when boss of the British Admiralty,
reconsidered the case of a sailor, and decided that
the flogging he had received was null and void.

Melbourne Argus reports, as an ordinary
passing incident, that a prisoner doing a two
years’ sentence has just received three months
extra with hard labor for “complaining about the
quality of the bread and hominy.” Why he fell
in was because he was unable to show that there
was anything wrong with the bread and hominy
on that particular day, but as it was the bread
and hominy of 21th January that he complained
of, and he was brought up on sth February, when
the victuals in question were no longer visible,
it is difficult to see that he had much chance to
prove anything. The officers simply said it was
a “groundless complaint,” and was made with a
view to “provoke a spirit of dissatisfaction.”
Their statement was as unprovable as the
prisoner’s, but they didn’t get three months —not
by any means.

still a wilderness. After the district had become
a fashionable watering place under its present
Italian name, godfather Duffy remained the prin-
cipal proprietor of the soil, and he was probably
the absentee landlord thereof at the time of his
death.
SQLOMONS J[?]GMENT SEAT.
A remarkable instance of the influence of
the imagination was provided by a Melb man,
arrested the other day whilst smashing up a local
bar. To the arresting constable he told a story
of how he had been standing by the counter when
he was struck a cowardly blow from behind by
another customer. He had then, in self-defence,
struck back, and was doing his best to beat off an
all-round attack when the police arrived. The
story was obviously untrue, but the man spoke
with such sincerity that his sanity began to be
doubted, until a witness who had seen the whole
thing unravelled the mystery. In reaching for
his glass, the man had come within the area
swept by a large electric fan, and receiv-
ing a “woodener” on the jaw, naturally attri-
buted it to the man nearest him, and proceeded to
make things even.
N.S.W. Industrial Arbitration President,
Justice Cohen, officially announces that “ the
policy of the tribunal is to encourage conciliation
between employers and employees.” Accordingly
he will give preference to cases where the sanction
of the court is asked to legalise agreements already
amicably arrived at.
“Adelaide” : G. H. Reid, on returning
here from the West, “ desired to explain ” to an
interviewer why lie asked Lyne and the other
ciVv « tPHVe ! in carriage ” from the
And-te old nit 6 ", tb 7- Were h6re
Ann—Denold !—the explanation was simply the
p d one over again-that Chief-Justice Way told
bun the departmental car was put on for him, and
he tried to be polite. It is safe to say that not
one person in six believed this before; it was
much easier to suppose that Reid, reaching the
carriage-door first, saw his way to a little joke.
Now it has to lie credited that Way 7 assumed the
Opjiosition leader would be honored while the
Ministry were overlooked, and that Reid was
fatuous enough to believe it.

Somebody writes from Melbourne Bug-
gearing that” the local Queen Victoria’s Record
Reign Memorial Fever Hospital, or whatever the
subscription-raisers propose to call it, might as
well take an up-to-date title in the event of its
coming into use. Queen Victoria is dead these
two years. The fever of “ loyalty ” occasioned by
her record reigning has burned out long ago, but
the hospital is not yet a going concern. Why not
call it King Edward’s Coronation Hospital and
ask the royal Ted for a much-needed subscription ?
People who feel shocked at this suggestion had bet-
ter ask themselves what they think of the late Duke
of Edinburgh s title on the facades of Australian
charitable institutions. Does any sentimental
interest attach to the faint memory of that one-
time Australian god ? Edinburgh is dead. Queen
Victoria is dead, likewise Queen Anne. Edward
VII. is alive, and lie might be induced to subscribe
largely to an appendicitis ward in the new
hospital. Appendicitis, by the way, is not an
infectious disease. But it is royal, and also
asluonable.

Tommy Bent, Victoria’s remarkable Rail-
ways Minister, has at length been driven by the
pressure of public opinion to get rid of two of his
‘‘scouts,’’and onlya pair nowremain intheservice.
Of late the reports of this curious crowd have been
even more humorous than usual. One of them set
forth that he (the scout) was watching a sale of
produce on the railway premises. One lot dis-
posed of was 25 bags of potatoes, but it proved
that there were only 24 bags, and the buyer was
told to take a bag from another lot to make things
square. He did so, the scout watching the bale-
ful transaction all the time. Inquiry proved that
the bag thus annexed came out of another heap
belonging to the same firm, so the vendor was
quite honestly disposing of his own potatoes, but
the scout sent in a lengthy report to the effect
that he was certain the parties recognised him,
and that if he hadn’t been there they would have
stolen somebody else’s potatoes. He probably
saw an embezzling expression in the vendor’s eye.
Another rejiort is said to have run thus;—
The Hon. the Minister of Railways.
Dear Sir, —On the 12th ins, Geelong, I ceesed the fol-
lowing trucks of timber ....
24 tons only against 35 tons 13-J cwt. The station
master at Geelong was very please with thise husiness of
my inspection was bromh forth, and he gave me every
assistans he possih y could, and he altreed the way-bills
for the 35 tons 14cwt. f, to be charged up in place of 24
tons.
The Truck 8.261, consigned to Ondit station as 6 tons.
I have instructed station master thear that the same is
8 tons 10cwt., ond to charge it up as that.—Yours faith-
fully,
Bent’s constituents appear to write in a highly
original strain.

The bright looking girl of 13 years who
S leaded guilty to a charge of attempted arson last
ydney Quarter Sessions has had a chequered
career. Born of unknown parents, she fell into the
hands of Makin, the notorious baby-farmer of 1890.
Instead of being skewered with a hat-pin, this
infant was for some unexplained reason handed
over to a suburban resident, who shortly after-
wards bestowed her on the State. The State
Children’s Dept, gave her a good character until
the day when, in a sudden desire for change, she
set fire to her master’s residence, under the im-
pression that this freak would disgust him with
her, which it certainly did. The judge sentenced
her to five years in Shaftesbury reformatory, but
the little incendiary lias the laugh on that judge
after all, because the Govt, has decided to abolish
Shaftesbury.

In an important spot in the Royal Park,
Melbourne, at the junction of two roads, and

obelisk with a large bronze tablet, erected to the
memory of a boy “who used to play in tiiis Park,”
and who afterwards joined a contingent, and was
shot in S’Africa. It quite rivals the cairn, a few
yards off, that marks the spot where Burke ai d

Owing to complaints from many business
firms to the effect that the letters that they
expected to turn up consistently didn’t, Sydney
P.O. authorities last week discovered that the
private letter boxes at the G.P.O. were being
robbed wholesale. On the P.O. detectives setting
a watch, they saw a young man go up to the box
of the Commissioners of Taxation, and, calmly
turning the lock with the small end of an ordi-
nary file, pocket the whole of the contents and
depart. When collared the thief was found to
have got away with over 120 letters—a nice haul,
considering that 75 per cent, of them probably
contained remittances of some sort from belated
taxpayers. But what can be said of the postal
authorities who, in these days of Yale locks, fit
their boxes with ones which may be easily mani-
pulated by any ordinary person “ with the small
end of an ordinary file?” It wasn’t the Federal
Government which supplied those locks either.

In his new capacity of Minister of Health
Tommy Bent has, according to the Melbourne
papers, promptly and vigorously proceeded to
“grapple” with the Fever Hospital problem.
(Melbourne Fever Hospital is the big building
which was put up in haste to mark some royal
event or other, and then, “loyalty” having cooled,
was left with no furniture, no nurses, no doctors,
no patients, and no money.) This is how Tommy
“ grapples ”
There is not a stick of furniture in the edifice. lam

their share in the cost of maintenance, and that eleven
are not. Dr. Gresswell tells me that it would cost from

infectious disease occurred to-night there would be no
place for treating the patient. lam not prepared to give
any expression of opinion as to whether the Government

The burglar boom in Sydney and suburbs
has widened the field of privitt®. employment.
Private houses have clubbed together to pay
watchmen from 10 p.m. to 0 a.m. The watchmen
are sworn-in as special constables, and carry a
license from the Inspector-General of Police.
DISCOVERED A CLUE.
“ The Pollce have discovered a clue."— DAILY PAPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If the Burglar has left with your jewels and plate
And all the dear relics you cherished of yore,
Don’t grieve and go moping and cursing your fate,
For that won't bring back what you’ve lost from your
store;
Besides, you may find as you run matters o’er,
There’s always a comfort for victims like you,
For the papers will tell in a day or two more—
“ We hear the Police have discovered a Clue 1"
If Sikes has garroted you down in the shade,
And laid you out stiff with his villainous lore,
Don’t fear for the end and be sad and dismayed,
But keep up the courage that’s left at your core;
For, though you depart for the Ultimate Shore,
And leave but a remnant, all blackened and blue,
Remember that soon (when a Seraph you soar)
Your friends, the Police, will discover a Clue !
Though Sikes and his friends go abroad unafraid,
And ravage again as they ravaged before,
Yet, think by what terrors their bosoms are swayed
As they go thro’ the land on their mission of gore;
For, brag as they may, they can never ignore
That, whenever they dive into crime as they do,
There is danger the P’lice will be soon at their door.
And discover a track that discovers a Clue 1
When Age is a burden and Life is a bore,
'Twill always delight us and cheer us anew,
To read how the Force, as they sweated and swore,
Let Fagin escape—but discovered a clue.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, February 17, 1903.
Mr Dear Arini,—
The episode of that Victorian nurse—a well-
brought up and well-educated girl with many
fnends of good standing—who suddenly gave
way to a millinery-drunk and attempted a
fraud on a Melbourne drapery firm,
should materially help on the work of the
Maoriland society which proposes to abolish
drapery and make every woman wear one long
plaiu garment of a single color. The pathetic
aspect of the drapery disease is its utter futility.
One great reason why woman dresses in feathers
and feather-stitching is that she seeks to catch the
eye of man, but then other women go and do like-
wise, and the first woman is no further ahead in the
matter of catching the eye of man than she was.
And if every woman wore a blue or grey or green
or brown plain hemmed garment extending from
her neck to her heels, she would also be just as
far ahead in the way of catching the eye of man;
and with the millinery question off her mind she
would be able to concentrate her attention more
upon her hair. The abolition of millinery should
receive the enthusiastic support of every woman
save one—the woman with the best clothes. All
the women who are left behind in the race, and
wlio vainly urge the clothes horse to its destina-
tion with not a hope of being even placed, should
welcome an idea whereby every cat must start
from scratch, in a manner of speaking.
The passing of St. Valentine’s Day is about
complete. Does anyone send a valentine nowa-
days? In a second-hand bookshop, last week, I
oame on a pile of minor magazines and “ladies’
papers” for February, 1871>, and all contained
stories or verses or pictures embodying the valen-
tine idea, just as now we have the Xmas or Faster
story. “He made his love known on 14th
February, by means of a strong hint—an edifice
of frosted ornate cardboard, scented and versed.
Her peroeptive faculties were so keen that she
took the hint, and went out to announce the
engagement to her dearest friend, May Lilian.
M.L. was discovered resting her cheek on her
index finger, and gazing pensively on a pair of
gloves scented with the perfume exha’ed by the
cardboard,* etc.” Another story ended : “ And
they called the baby Valentia in memory of the
mingled joy and sorrow the feast had brought
them.” Some Sydney shops must have a stock of
Valentine horrors on hand since the time that the
14th of February was something more than just a
day in the month.
Some little shops in lower George-st., where
The Bulletin comes from, annually display
“nasty” valentines—women with forked tongues,
or women crawling snakewise in the grass. Evi-
aently, Valentine-senders used the feast day as a
means to display, anonymously, their malice
towards their neighbor. Now they spend the
tuppence on a Sunday paper; and get more
satisfaction of malice therefrom.
A friend, who would rather wear a stylish hat
on earth than a halo in Paradise, tells me that the
lining of the hat “to be worn this winter” will be
of more importance than what trims its upper
levels. Linings of folded velvet or chiffon—the
former is the more becoming, but very heavy—
will be the thing. And she adds something about
“ the possession of a toque of white birds with a
cream dra e of lace” as leaving no gap in any
woman’s life. Paste buckles have glittered their
last giit, for oxyciised steel and silver have taken
th ’ir place. Endless rows of “pinked ” silk box-
pi eaed i lings, or rows of box-pleated gauze
ribbon, will lie worn by every real lady.
One wishes that a “ great discussion ” that took
pi use among titled ladies in camp just before the
e ii Durbar, concerning the propriety or other-
"i-eof “curtseying” to Lady Curzoti, had been
preserved in a grarnaphone or by a stenographer.
Duchesses of Portland and Marlborough took part
in the discussion, and maintained that for them to
curtsey to the Chicago pork-packer’s daughter
would be to elevate her to royal rank. It was
finally decided not to ourtsey to her, as “she had
no official rank and is merely the wife of an Irish
baron of recent creation.” Merely a “ person,” in
fact; and a Duchess can’t be too careful as to’ her
conduct towards “ persons ” —especially the rare
type of duchess who did not climb to the peerage
with the aid of a pair of shapely “front-row” legs.
There is one tram conductor in Sydney who is
fitted by painful experience to say a few words on
gratitude. He saved the lives of a woman and
child (a dozen persons saw him do it) who had got
off a tram on the wrong side just as another tram
was all but upon them. He had no time for a
warning, but just sprang onto the footboard and
fairly threw the woman back into the carriage.
The coming tram struck one of his legs and in-
jured it. Onlookers thought it was broken, but
the woman whom he saved indignantly called a
policeman and wanted to give her rescuer in
charge, for insulting behaviour, or tearing her
skirt, or something. And she was picturesquely
angry because, instead of being led away hand-
cuffed, he was allowed to depart to a hospital to
have his injured foot bandaged.
Another contribution to the eternal domestic
servant controversy comes from the manager of
some rabbit, refrigerating works. He advertised
for girls to work at the factory, and young ladies
turned up in shoals. He informed them that the
work was not too nice and somewhat tedious, but
he was glad to sav that he could offer one of them
a superior position as house and parlor maid, or
something. -Then one and all the noses were
tilted up, and every young lady resolutely scorned
domestic service.
1« there any explanation of the early greyness
•f Australian women? The silver streak on the
temple and in the front “ roll ” is quite usual with
women in the early thirties. We have, unfortun-
ately, grown accustomed to the lined, colorless
faces of most Sydney women over 20. Is the
climate, or the meat-eating habit, or whatever is
responsible for that, going to cause also the
coloring matter of the hair to fail in a wholesale
fashion ?
on her last visit to Sydney, heard Miss
Linda O’Hara sing, and expressed surprise at
such a big voice having its home in one so young.
Linda is only 16, but has a contralto voice like the
mighty deep. She gives a concert at the Y.M.C.A.
hall on Tuesday, March 3.
Local musical authorities say that Amy Castles’
middle register has improved since she sang here
some months ago. Amy now has a Melbaish
little way of acknowledging audiences’ enthu-
siasm. She does not bow as of yore, but just
smiles and nods faintly into the middle distance.
Sydney’s village of Manly takes its local talent
very seriously, and for some time recently the
local hall has been crowded again and again to
hear the young soprano, Miss Hilda Mulligan, as
Josephine in Gilbert and Sullivan’s evergreen
‘ Pinafore.” Miss Mulligan will leave for Prance
early in April, witli a view to qualifying for
operatic honors.
A three-year-old’s saying. He had been to a
cricket match and had been bored: “ But I
thought you’d have loved cricket,” said his
mother. He sucked his thumb over the matter
for a minute, and then asked : “ How could 1 love
it; it hasn’t a face to be kissed ? ”
Writes my Melbourne correspondent
“ Is it the ‘ roley-poley ’ aspeot of George Reid,
or the ineradicable love for a free entertainment,
that endears him to plain, domesticated woman
who take no ordinary interest in politics ? There
were hundreds of her pressing to the front seats
on Thursday night at the Town Hall, when George
was advertised to show. The man with the fat
neok—-‘and the fat hangeth down on his sides’—
is a historic object of feminine ridicule. Before
and after Falstaff he has been guyed of women.
But though the elderly Yes-No Reid hath a fat
neck, and his waist strains the two-yard tape
measure, women are very fond of him. On
Saturday they ‘ dressed ’ the hall for him splen-
didly. The balconies glittered with bright eyes
and brighter hats. An upstanding widow of un-
counted wealth wore suoh a dress as dreams are
made of—a cream gauze ground, wrought with
the palest pink roses and fine gold fibre.
“ The only picturesque male in the Reid plat-
form party was Senator Smith, the urbane, curly-
whiskered, complacent Westralian. His wide
smile is an anthem breathing peace on earth to
men and women (don’t forget the women) of good
will. The pleasant, smiling silence of Mr. Smith
seemed to say as plain as words : ‘Will the wild
a-is bray when he hath grass ? ’ Not much smile-
fulness about the other Freetraders. They were a
sorrowful lot, looking as if they had been reared
in tin conventicles on doctrines of predestination
and drapery Huff. Alleged Senator Reid was
something of an exception. He has prospered
greatly on fluff, and rejoices in a cheerful benignity
and Pecksniffian playfulness.
“ Some people argue that Melba’s success is due
to the fact that she has a ways had ‘ dazzling
luck.’ ‘Not always,’ said Melba with a quizzical
shake of the head, when this theory was quoted to
her. t Even since she came back this time, the
Diva 8 paths have proved themselves sometimes
thorny. Landing, after an absence of 16 years,
she found her father very ill. Soon after her
arrival, her tried and trusty maid took ill and died.
T’other day, at her afternoon party, she kept
a smiling face, but was really ‘down in her
boots’ because her youngest brother had
met with a bad accident that morning, breaking
a limb and receiving other damage. Then it was
no joke for a singer, whose future hinges on her
voice, to sustain throat-strain, however slight, on
her way to Tassy. Still, there’s truth, no doubt,
in Grundy’s saying that ‘ Everybody believes in
luck except fools, who attribute their successes to
their merits.”
. “At that Melba reception guests were interested
in seeing how the star arranged the flowers in her
rooms. Artistic profusion and richness of colour
were obtained by masses of cut pink-oleanders,
and orange-cannas with brown foliage, growing
in jars. People from ’Ome usually affect
broader—some might say ‘coarser’ floral effects
than we m Australia. Our abundance of flowers
is a joy to Londoners, accustomed to consider the
cost of the florist’s daily supply. When Eng-
landers go to the Riviera and similar flowery
places they rave about the bright blossoms and
revel in their unstintedness, just as they do when
they come here. Now, we would be apt to banish
cannas and oleanders to halls and landings, and
aim at dainty, fairy-like effects for the drawing-
room.
“Social folk learnt their importance in Melba’s
mind the other day, when all had to step from
their carriages in the roadside and pad the hoof
‘up the gravelled drive of Myoora,’ while the
Mitchell clan drove right to the doormat. Pa
Mitchell’s plain old trap scattered the dust of the
drive in the faces of the swagger trampers.
“ The carriage and pair honored by Melba while
here are offered for sale in the enticing verbiage of
the livery-dealer. Primary importance is given
to the fact, ‘ used by Melba.’ After that comes
the comfortable assurance that steeds and carriage
‘behavesplendidly when moving through crowds.’
If the liveryman could give a guarantee that the
crowds would gather for the new owner to move
through, what a rush of opulent drapers there
would be for that car 1
“ Melba’s little harpiste must thank her stars
that she won the liking of the hearty Australienne.
Not only did the star’s friendship lead to this
Australian tour—no small boon to a clever ehild-
performer —but throughout the trip the youug girl
has been made as much of as if she were her
principal’s little sister. She frisks about ‘Myoora/
radiant with ‘ home sweet-homeness,’ snap-shots
every comer that takes her fancy, be it potentate
or pauper, and is petted by all who wish to please
Melba. Her mother, also attached, is a tall, fine-
faced Italian, who at the ‘ Myoora ’ reception
looked attractive and dignified in trailing robes of
cool lilac.
“ Melbourne tourists in Tasmania write in in-
dignation of ‘the stupidity of the people’ expect-
ing Melba to rasp in song when her throat was
inflamed. But even before they knew of that
tender * thorax ’ the slow islanders stared
stolidly at the healthy-looking diva, on arrival,
and failed to strain their throats in a wild
yell of delight. As for her departure—
let the curtain drop on that growlsome scene 1
‘lt wasn’t at all nice or reasonable of the
Tasmanians,’writes a much hurt Toorakite, ‘and
it is rubbish to talk of their bruised feelings and
racking disappointments—especially in the light
of Melba’s good-natured promise to come again
and sing for them, guarantor or no guarantor. A
bit of tact, in truth, on her part that the public
here are astonished at. Melba so seldom nas to
stoop to strategy.
“From another source comes a quizzical ac-
count of how Mr. Barton—that Noble Son of the
Empire—took leave of a disconcerted and rather
sullen Queen of Song. It seems Toby only arrived
at 9 o’clock in the morning, and the welkin didn’t
ring at his coming either—Tasmanians evidently,
not desiring to strain their vocal organs. At noon
Melba was billed to leave, unhonored and unsung,
so a complaining crowd gathered to see her
off the premises. She didn’t look too ill, but
had quite a blooming damson-plum look. When
Toby and Senator ‘ Bubbles ’ Keating hove along
to express their kind and sympathetic adieux,
the trio looked rather joyful. Then the crowd
hissed. Probably Toby enjoyed the situation,
since he had experienced the Chilled Reception
himself only a few hours previously, and was glad
now to be chilled in famous company. ‘ Bubbles’
was conciliatory, being fearful alike of his con-
stituents’ curse and of his companions’ condemna-
tion ; so he steered guilefully ’twixt Scylla and
Chary bdis.
“ Book-Arcadian Cole, and his busy larger
half, likewise Miss Cole, their eldest daughter,
leave for Japan in April to attend the Exhibition
at Tennoji (City of Osaka) as guests of the
Government, if you please. The invitation card
from the Jap. Minister of Agriculture is the
result, firstly, of Mr. Cole’s anti-White Australia
book, and, secondly, it expresses the devotion of
certain Jap naval officers to Mrs. and Miss Cole,
who. entertained the. little brown men at their
domicile over the Melb. Book Arcade, and taught
them ping-pong in one lesson. The nautical
ping-pongers threatened all sorts of honors and
hospitalities to the Coles in the event of their
going to Japan, and now that they are going Ma
and daughter begin to wonder whether pater-
familias will be cieatefl a Japanese marquis of the
first water, or a Pooh Bah Extraordinary, or what.
“ A mellow pair joined hands, the other day,
after an acquaintance extending over 23 years,
and a fortnight’s engagement. Strange how,
once the celibate mind generated the idea of
matrimony, there was this sudden rush to arms.
For 23 years this man and-woman friendship
thrived. They were downright chums, and
nothing more. Then, one day, the quiet bachelor
bethought of having greater opportunities of chat
with the comparatively lonesome lady. He sub-
mitted the idea of matrimony; a fortnight later,
they were married.
“The Jewish Rabbi with the flowing mane,
Rev. Lenzer, sat amidst a garden of millinery at
the ‘Zaza’ matinee, last Wednesday. The holy
man liked and applauded the bright blue play—
Wednesday being a cool, appropriate day for such
enjoyment. Women who know, you know, agree
that the anvil of passion is first struck in the play
when Zaza, in her scented faint (or is it feint?)
rejects with.a.pathetic grimace the glass of water
her victim offers, and flings at him in her passion-
ate stress the taunt, ‘ No—l’m hungry ! ’
“The clerical crowd was not so exceptionally
noticeable at the Saturday Castles’ concert. All
the same, the crowd looked like a big St. Pat’s
Cathedral congregation in gay garb. Rev. G.
Robinson had a lean, ascetic young curate in tow,
and the pair sat in the balcony for a while, then
drifted behind the scenes. The one social per-
sonage in the audience was the newly-returned
Mrs. Edward Miller whose grey-haired stateliness
struck a note of distinction. A magniftcerit cloak
in black and white tones was shed after its effect
was established. In her party was a pinkish girl
wearing a classic wreath of roses.
“The Castles sisters ‘take the cake’for plat-
form deportment. Ease, self-possession, an
absence of ‘ cheeky ’ airs mark their coming and
going. Some of Amy’s vocal flourishes on Satur-
day were sweet as the notes of the lute, but
there’ll never be anv stormful stress about her

waves of hair, and archness—brought the house

“Gov. Ranfurly, of Maoriland, has just got
his eldest son (Lord Northland) back from Eng-
land, where the youngster went for education.
Dad means to try sonnie on the aide tack for a

dura will once more be able to plume itself on the
fact that its fruitgrowers’ list includes the name

“Local penwomen, amongst others, are in-

This inte.lectual little lady was edu-
cated at the Presbyterian Ladies’ College. In
those days. Professor Harper took great pride in

to find tho Star, on close terms, a dazzler too
dangerous, too fiery, altogether.
“ A distinguished mother has raised her voice
to the shepherds of the Hobart flojks, warning
them not to marry her daughter, who is yet in her

“ When the Melb. girl of grit and fashion finds
her cash resources at a low ebb, and slmbbiness in
the dread vista of the future, she often shows
resource. There are numerous instances in Ool-
lins-street of social flutterers showing a sudden
accession of brains and practical energy, and
establishing massage, millinery and agency con-
cerns, and prospering. Two particularly bright
members of the hard-up Society species have gone
further afield, and set up the grease pots and the
steaming apparatus of the modern beauty mill at
Colombo. There, they catch Vanity both ways,
coming and going via the ocean liners. The pair
are thriving by turning out blouses, complexions,
and millinery-rigging on the spot.
“The girls of a certain popular bun-house are
comjielled to have their thatches dressed in the
ornate style for which they are so widely noted.
When novices are unable to carry out the work
themselves, they are recommended to employ a
professional hair-dresser in the vicinity, and if
they demur at the shilling charge, the manageress
attends to the novice herself. But a uniform
style is insisted upon. Also, the manicurist is
recommended by the Autocrat of the Tea Room.
This often means that the maid who carries round
the bun has to spend on her toilet a big proportion
of her wage. Evidently the calling is reckoned a
‘spec’ by the little dears—a preliminary to march-
ing up the aisle to ‘ The Voice that Breathed o’er
Eden.’
“In many places the drought still (joes on. All
the owners who can have tied, leaving the man-
agers, the men, and the stock to fight it out.
Sometimes the owner stands to his guns, but
sends his wife and chicks away. The women who,
from choice, not necessity, stay with their hus-
bands deserve credit. Mrs. Ainslie Mills, formerly
Miss Lorna Price, of Melbourne, is one of the
plucky ones. If Uardry is not too hot for her
husband, says sbe, it is not too hot for her either,
or for baby Mills. ‘Tut, tut!’ said her father’
Colonel Tom Price, up in Brisbane, when some-
one commended his daughter’s endurance in stay-

“A typist on the hunt for a berth recently
answered the ad. of a small solicitor who wanted

She explained that she was there to make the
appointment, to examine credentials, and inquire
as to morals. Stated that the post is still vacant.
“A deputation of 22 recently waited on the
proprietor of a swell seaside hotel to ask for
proper supervision over the visitors’ roll-call.
They had a grievance. The gay, good-looking
bachelor with delightful curls, who had been the
guiding spirit of all impromptu picnics and ping-
pong parties, was discovered by some mischance, at
the close of a three week’s reign, to be a barber!
The proprietor pleaded that he didn’t know the
nature of the young man’s city employment. He
had observed only that he was ‘of pleasant
address, nice manners, and the most sought after
person in the place.’ However he promised to
institute some inquiries for the future as to the
status of his bachelor boarders.
Why don’t the men propose ? ’ was asked by
Mrs. Andrews in a recent lecture on Matrimony,
and she went on to advocates ‘ Bachelors’ Tax ’
to force men into matrimonial bliss. But that is
as unreasonable as the cabbie, who lashed his pur-
blind horse for not seeing past the end of its nose.
In such well bachelored centres as big banks and
such-like institutions, matrimony, by employes not
in receipt of a certain salary, is rewarded
by instant dismissal. And the prescribed
pittance, small as it is, will never be
obtained by a large proportion of the staff, and
that not through any fault of their own. It’s a
bright outlook for the poor bachelor of the future
if he is liable to a fine for celibacy and doomed to
dismissal for matrimony. Mrs. Andrews ought
to advocate that the firms relinquish control over
the hearts and souls of officials. Head and hands
are as much as authority can righteously demand
in return for a pittance. Leave it to the under-
as free men, to marry or not as they choose ;
and, as to recipients of a living wage only, do not
demand of them fine clothes and a genteel estab-
lishment. _ Let them dress and house like the
humble toilers they really are, and then, in the
stress of impecunious matrimony, they won’t be
driven to lighten their employers’ coffers for the
price of a prescribed black coat and starched
collar.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

Dr. Lowther Clarke has, it is recorded,

to the figure on the Bishop’s cheque. Three or
four Australian Bishops had to borrow the money.

In a paragraph relative to the removal of

Larry Foley’s semi-political outing has
brought back the gaiety of his early days, and
jogs him to revive old stories. Larry, according
to legend, was killed in Glen Innes a quarter of a
century ago. He fought, with the gloves, a little
seven stone lawyer there, who didn’t know who
he was, and professed to fall down dead as the
result of injuries received at the hands of the
shocked and terrified Six-and-Eightpence. After
much weird wassailing, Larry revived and carried
the lawyer round the town.
Bully Bent’s appointment as Public Works
Minister recalls his former occupancy of that
position in the Service days. Thomas was a bully
in those times also, and once kicked a too persis-
tent visitor out of the public offices without call-
ing in the assistance of the messengers. People
who know the two men predict a healthy row pre-
sently between Bent, who has also become Health
Minister, and Dr. Gresswell, the suave but deter-
mined permanent head of the Health department,
who has for years been practically Ministerless.
Victorian ex-Lands Minister M’Kenzie
was a very pious politician, and always hurried to
his electorate at week-ends so as to teach in
Sunday-school. Also, he was one of the deeply-
shocked crowd which voted the expulsion from
the Assembly of Labor member Findley for re-
printing a libel on the King. Considering the
selfish, sordid, squalid circumstances of M’Kenzie’s
offence, the King will probably not admire his
follower very much. One of the troubles of a
King is the dreadful people that will be devoted
to him.
One of the delights of the recent Federal
Westralian trip was Laurence Foley, Esq., aide-
de-camp to Minister Owe’Sullivan, At the Mun-
daring well-opening, when speeches were long and
the tent fearfully hot, Larry called a number of
on-looking swaggies and outsiders to him, handed
them from the table several bottles of wine and
whisky, and asked them to drink to “Mister
O’Sullivan and the minimum wage. God bless
him ! ” The men would have drunk to Mahomet
or any other good Sydney man, but the chairman’s
looks nearly turned the good wine into vinegar.
Larry’s troubles!
Every Federal politician of note is orating
somewhere or other in view of next election—bar
only George Turner. Plain George says curtly
that he doesn’t propose to inflict himself on his
own, or anybody else’s, constituents ; he reckons
that his own constituents will stand by him just
as well if he doesn’t talk to them, and he isn’t
sure that anybody else’s constituents want to hear
him ; anyhow he is going to stay at the Treasury
and keep the mill grinding as usual. And when
Barton is drifting round promiscuously, and Bill
Lyne and Bigjohn are away turning on the Cool-
gardie water supply, and Drake is seeing his old
friends in Brisbane, and Fysh is beaming round
generally, and Kingston is busy prosecuting the
honest importer who accidentally passed 48
fraudulent entries, Plain George keeps most of
the mills going round.

Michael Gillfedder, the hard-faced bat-
tler who lately lost his seat in Maoriland
House of Representatives, met his Waterloo at
windy Lumsden, where three pubs, keep the local
rabbiter from suicide. Gillfedder was enthusias-
tically barracking for the Govt, borrowing pro-
posals, and advising an even wilder razzle,
when a beery voice from the back of the hall
said, “ Why don’t you borrow a new face?” Gill-
fedder is a person of deeply-concealed beauty, and
his candidature never recovered from the shock.
Writes a man who knew him :
When a politician of such long standing as “ Dismal
Bill ” Rolleston dies he is usually a small fortune to those
paragraphists who deal in personal reminiscences. But,
after putting in nearly 40 years in Maoriland politics,
Rolleston goes out without, so far as I can remember,
having said a bright thing, or inspired anyone else to say
a really bright thing about him. He wasn’t a wit, nor
did he inspire wit. He hadn’t, so far as I know, one
cheerful vice. He was a buttoned-up man who spent his
life in solitary confinement inside his own expensive coat.
But perhaps he was more cheerful when I wasn’t about.
Many people are.
How many human beings are there now
alive who can say that they saw and spoke to the
great Napoleon ? One of those died at Brisbane
(Q.). last week—Louis Stamm, aged 96. When
Stamm was a chubby boy of five the great warrior,
then retreating from Moscow, passed through the
farm of Stamm’s father in Posen, and the
youngster was patted on the head by the Little
Corporal. (Great men seem to have always had
an incurable habit of patting children on the
head.) Stamm had been in the northern State
since 1852 and his father died a few years ago
aged 114.
Hon. Ebenezer Ward, now in political and
financial doldrums, was once a burning and a
shining light in the S.A. Ereetrade temple. He
held Ministerial office for years and was called
“the Farmer’s Friend.” He had sat in the local
Parliament longer than any other member at the
time of his rejection, a few years ago. _ Yet Reid
dropped down hard upon the old believer at his
recent Adelaide meeting, and jeered coarsely at
his allegedly old clothes; and Ward unburdened
his sorrows in a letter to the Advertiser, in
which he washed his hands of Reid and all his
political works.
“ Adelaide ” : Having just gazed upon
George Reid for the first time I desire to testify
to the great faithfulness of “ Hop’s ’’ pictures. It
was all there, the eye-glass (that is easy), the
alternate grin and frown, the coat fitting anyhow,
the generous feet, the commanding commissariat-
department (this last assumed really noble pro-
portions, because exigencies of space compelled
me to watch it sideways for over two hours). Only
one thing was wanting. The space round the feet
seemed curiously empty ; it is easv to understand
the Kalgoorlie miners demanding to know:

Capt. Evans, just about to relin-
quish service as Inspector-General of
vie. prisons on the score of ill-health,
at one ti me saw smart work as a naval
officer on the African coast. He also
had some experience in the West Indies,
but eventually settled down to civil ser-
vice work in N.S.W., and afterwards
in Victoria, where he entered Govt, em-
ployment as super, of reformatories,
then became inspector of charities, and
ultimately prison-chief. Capt. Evans, a
man of nervous disposition, was hectored
into retiring by the papers; his depart-
ment was about as good as the authorised
system would allow, but he had to take
the blame belonging to shiftless Minis-
ters dominated by fundless Treasurers.
Capt. Evans was much cut up over the
escape of convicts O’Connor and Sparks
from Pentridge, the first successful
event of its kind in his 13 years of prison
administration.
The death of politician Sargood
recalls that Victoria has not yet pro-
duced a Parliamentarian who has left
behind him the reputation of being a
statesman. O’Shanassy, Haines, Heales,
Sladen, M'Culloch, Higinbotham, Ser-
vice, Gillies, Berry, all played their
parts, and quickly passed into the limbo
of forgotten things. O’Shanassy was
the ablest and most far-seeing of the lot,
but he was hopelessly handicapped from
the start by his over-strong denomina-
tional proclivities, and, in later life, by
that crusted Toryism and hardness of
character which so often accompany the
acquisition of wealth. Higinbotham is
remembered as that rara avis, an honest
politician—a man of deep convictions
and unswerving sincerity. Sargood was
a legislator of small abilities, but great
industry. When, as a member of the
Leg. Council, he took to reading all the
Bills and Acts of Parliament which
came under review, the indolent fos-
sils of the Chamber made him their
bell-wether, and followed like sheep.
Bishops evidently have something
within them which irresistibly drags
them to Hingland. Dr. Stone Wigg,
of British Papua, and Dr. Webber, of
Brisbane, are there now ; and Dr. Harmer, of
Adelaide, and Dr. Saumarez Smith, of Sydney,
are on their way. Dr. Riley, of Perth, and Dr.
Wilson, of Melanesia, have just come back. If
the local priests were used up as diocesans they
might, perhaps, look upon Australia as home ; but
the other fellows cannot forget that Dr. Selwyn
went from Maoriland to Lichfield, Dr. Moorhouse
from Melbourne to Manchester, and Dr. Kennion
to Bath and Wells. Peradventure, they think,
if we keep our English patrons in mind of us we,
too, may be promoted.
Melbourne barrister Purves scored a point
against the Supreme Court, the other day. Chief
Justice Madden said he was half-inclined to think
that Mr. Purves “intended to be disrespectful.”
Whereupon Purves assured the Court, in effect,
that, when the Court felt any doubt on such a
matter, it might decide at once that he didn't
intend to be disrespectful. Any time he did
intend to show disrespect for the Court, he would
do it in such a way that the Court could have no
doubt at all. In fact, Purves almost informed the
Court, speaking as a practitioner with long expe-
rience of being disrespectful to Courts, that his
kind of disrespect was visible to the naked eye
every time. Then matters settled down.
M‘Kenzie, the Yic. squatter and ex-Minis-
ter for Lands, seems to have struck a bad patch of
luck. He was not out of his trouble over the land
taken up by him while a Minister when he had to
submit to a serious operation for a growth between
ear and throat; the surgeons are unable to say at
present whether it is malignant or not. Almost
at the very time he was being operated on, the
Iceberg Irvine crowd was filling his vacant port-
folio, without waiting for the verdict of the
special committee of the House appointed to
inquire into the charges. Whatever the merits of
the case against M ‘Kenzie, the Ministry certainly
acted with the most cold-blooded and indecent
brutality in condemning a colleague ere the
tribunal sitting on him had given its decision.
The death, the other day, of W. H. Tite,
an Adelaide ex-merchant, sets The Bulletin
wondering what connection there is between rags
and religion. Some, evidently. In the bigger
cities it isn’t so noticeable; but in the smaller
places the man who deals in muslins and tapes on
Saturdays nearly always carries round the plate
on Sundays. The most likely explanation is that
women are the chief clients alike of the church
and of the draper’s shop; wherefore the best way
for the draper to advertise (in a comparatively
small community) is to go to church, and, being
at church, to carry the plate. And the grocer
and the other males let him ; for one thing, they
haven’t the ragman’s gorgeous apparel, and for
another, they never learned the lordly walk that
oomes to the draper through leading the way to
the bargain counter.

A Buninyong (V.) P.O. official some time

The latter fell into an abandoned shaft, which

In trying to get him out, the man of stamps
tumbled in himself, when began a struggle for
the survival of the fittest. The dog proved a bad
companion in a well, making desperate attempts
to scramble on top of his master. After 2£ hours
the brute succumbed. Stamps found a foothold
sft. under water, but frequently slipped off.
When he had bobbed around for three hours his
sister accidently discovered him ; and, according

Sydney Kiein, a Hebrew business man,

who, in his opinion, are undoubtedly Jews. He
witnessed the rite of circumcision on an infant
with a piece of sharp flint. This tribe, which
lives quite apart from other aborigines, made
burnt offerings of goats and birds and observed
Saturday as a sacred holiday. When Klein
showed them a Hebrew prayer-book, an old man,
who could read parts of it, said the language was
an extinct one which his forefathers used to
speak. The latter part of this yarn strikes us as
very weak.

“ C.C.” : Be aboriginal shell-heaps (8.,
17/l/’O3). One may see piles of shells along the
Tas. E. coast, and the search of the relic-hunter
is usually rewarded by finding a sample or two of
the primitive little flint “knives” which the
blacks used to open oysters or cockles. Mr. E. O.
Cotton—one of the oldest East Coast residents —
has a very valuable collection of aboriginal curios
at “ Kelvedon.”
The Fates, hitherto so kind to southern
Victoria in the matter of pasture, have of late
been balancing things up. A locust-swarm has
left a belt of coastal country absolutely bare of
grass, thus putting owners of “starvers” in a
worse plight than ever, for as yet there is no feed
to speak of in the North.

Water is sometimes as potent as whisky.
After the recent rains at Dead Horse Creek a
young selector was observed dancing, brolga
fashion, out in his paddock, for the delectation of
crows and iguanas. The shock of seeing water
in the creek had been too much for him.

“Yeppoon” : According to Rockhampton
Bulletin (2/2/’O3), “a horse was being broken in
on a selection close to the Byfield Road, and the
ground, which is of blacksoil, was so sticky that
the animal literally bucked clean out of its hoofs,
leaving them stuck fast in the mud.” Champion 1
Three young girls, aged 17 to 20,
some weeks ago, performed a big feat on
the Gilbert River (Q.). A well-bred
chesnut stallion had been running since
a colt with a mob of brumbies on Para-
mount, and at intervals, for some years,
the pick of stockmen on surrounding
stations had essayed to catch him and
failed; in fact, the fleet-flooted outlaw
was looked upon as utterly unyardable.
Then, one day, the three girls (Misses
Wilson, Harrod and Campbell) dropped
on him accidentally, and gave chase.
The stallion made straight for his old
jump into the bed of the Gilbert —a
sheer 30ft. —by which he had often eluded
pursuers. Miss Wilson, who was well-
mounted, cut him off, and for two miles
raced between him and the bank, cleverly
frustrating his frequent efforts to bolt
across. Suddenly he wheeled back into
the mob, and after getting his wind,
made a lightning rush for Rocky Creek,
and a run of six miles through timber
took place ere they got him turned back
into the mob. Meanwhile Miss Wilson’s
horse had fouled a tree, and fallen, but
luckily no injury was done, and she was
soon up and again under way. Misses
Harrod and Campbell had stuck to the
mob, and after many more exciting
spurts and dashes, and an estimated
chase of 12 miles, they rushed the outlaw
and his contingent into Paramount
yards.

“ D. H. R. ” (re “ Kink, ” B. 24/l/’03):
I have always found that a snake springs
only about half its own length.
A true bill :
The Victorian farmer has a beautiful idea of the pur-
poses of Government. A Melb. Agb correspondent com-
plained, the other day, of the S3'stem of stock inspection,
the main subject of his growl being that Govt, inspectors
are not sent round to every farm where a couple of cows
or horses are ailing, to give free advice to the man on the
land as to treatment. “ Farmers,” he remarked, “ are so
disgusted with the whole system that rather than inform
the inspectors, they let the cattle die.” Which typifies
the present-day shiftlessness of the man on the land
exactly In other countries, when the farmer’s horse or
his ox or his pig is ailing, its owner sends round at once
for a vet. and pays him, if the sickness is such that he
cannot deal with it himself. In Victoria he sends to the
Agricultural Department for a State expert, and if the
expert isn’t speedily forthcoming, the farmer wants to
know the reason why. Victoria has just had an experi-
ence of this kind with its “ speying expert,” who was
originally engaged for a year to give a few exhibitions of
his art, and was discovered still on the job at the end of
four years. But he wasn’t engaged in merely showing the
farmer how to do things for himself—oh, dear no 1
That expert was moving round from farm to farm and
speying whole herds free of cost to the owners. And
when he was recalled, great was the wail of the man who
was waiting his turn to get some cows treated. But the
Victorian farmer goes on growling that the city mops up
all the money, and if you were to tell him that he was
a pampered mendicant reaping the advantages of a
socialistic system of agricultural government, he would
snort with exceeding bitterness and unbelief, and call
together a public meeting to rebuke the authorities for
failing to appoint a post and rail expert to assist him in
the proper protection of his property against invasion by
Stray animals.

Sheep-farmers in Northern S.A. are losing
numbers of sheep lately by what is, apparently, a
new disease. It affects the eyes of the sheep; in
a short time they become totally blind, and starve

Elmore: Have been among rabbits 12
years trapping, poisoning, digging-out, fumigat-
ing, &c., and I agree with “Frank D.” (8., 31/l/’O3)
that there’s no £lO a week in the game; but
there is from £2 10s. to £4, according to country,
distance to cart, and quantity of rabbits. If
“ F.D.” could find 100 traps first set in a 1500-
acre blocks, he must have forgotten to dig a hole
for his traps, or else bunny saw him coming. No
trapper would set 100 traps this time of year; he
would have to start too early to get them down,
and if any rabbits got in they would be dead
before he could get round to take them out (no-
thing kills bunny quicker, when trapped, than the
sun). Fifty traps are plenty, and if each one is
set to catch, not dropped anywhere, and bunny is
numerous, an average catch of 40 a night should
be made, which, at 6d. per pair on railway-station
(usual average in Vic.), would give a decent
living. Digging-out is very good in winter and
entails no night work. Choose the hole to dig
out and block up the others. Re poisoning for
skins when there’s no way of selling carcase:
strychnine, though expensive, is, in the long run,
cheapest, and good money can be thus made. Cut
apples in |-inch pieces, sprinkle on the poison from
a pepper-caster, make some clean scrapes with a
spade, and drop three or four pieces on each.
Bunny will be found next morning a couple of
yards away.

“6xB” : Your suggestion that a recent
Sydney fatality might possibly have been averted
but for the hesitation to expose a naked man to
some women, recalls a sad S. Gippsland (Vic.)
occurrence of some years ago. A young newly-
married selector’s wife and her sister went
swimming in a hole in the creek, some 300yds.
away from the selector’s house. A man, whom
the women had passed, was burning-off timber
not 50yds. away. The young wife was suddenly
overcome and sank. The water was very clear,
and the woman’s body could be plainly seen at
the bottom. The 18-year-old sister got out and
dressed herself before calling for help, and when
the burner-off arrived the woman was, of course,
past hope. When asked at the inquest why she
didn’t call for help at once, the girl said, “’Cause
I was afraid I’d be seen naked.”
THAT LLAMA.
TAR-BOY JOE (from up-country , at the Zoo): “ ’Struth!

“ B.” Be an answer in B. 7/2/’O3. : There
is a dome-shaped mountain known as “Morgan’s
Lookout,” near Kyamba, on Wagga Wagga-
Carabost-road. The top of this mountain com-
mands a good view of the old Sydney-Melbourne-
road, which passes through Tarcutta. It stands
just near where the latter road crosses the former.
It was near here that Morgan, after substituting
the best hack on Yeoman’s station (then American
Yards, now Humula) for his own worn-out beast,
stuck up a Chinaman, and, making him stand
with his back towards him, put a revolver bullet
through each ear-lobe of the celestial and then
“ let him depart in peace.”

“ Lin.” . Last year S. W. Victorian land-
lords found'seed-wheat for necessitous tenants on
condition that an equal quantity of grain would be
a first call on ensuing crop, with per cent,
interest added on its then cost —viz., 2s. 9d. per
bushel. This returned wheat at present value
(6s. 6d. per bushel) and interest equal nearly 4s.
an acre extra rent. This year needy tenants will
be supplied with seed at current money value and
interest which, when next year’s prices are up,
will mean a heavy loss per acre on seed alone.
Dear fodder, dry weather, hard ground, heavy
expenses for plough-irons, phenomenally dear
seed, and a big drop in prices sure to come next
year, will blow out all hope for the unfortunate
Mallee cookies down south.

“ Waddy ” on dust-storms :
We back-country people read with bitterness of the
experiences of Sydneyites in dust-storms. A grim smile
bares our teeth at the columns in the papers over Syd-
ney’s sorrows, printed with the three-line wire about the
Western dust-storms. Living, as Sydney residents do, on
part of the selvedge edge of Australia, where lies the only
land with anything like a regular rainfall, what, I ask, do
they know of dust ? Picture a day in the arid west, the
glass showing 110 to 120 in the shade, a stretch of flattish
country in rags of vegetation, spotted only at intervals
with the cheerless gum or the grey box. Under-foot lies
the soul-destroying red of the red soil, the everlasting,
blinding, burning red of the western land. The sun
climbs from beneath the world early. It shimmers on
the edge of the horizon with heat, and early the
mercury begins to mount the scale. The day drags on in
a blinding glare. There is no wind. All Nature seems dead.
No life stirs abroad other than a few specimens of blas-
phemous humanity. Human eyes look the sky over, but
out of its glare there is no promise of comfort. At last a
blistering breeze rises from the N.W. It whirls over the
land with a whiff of dust in its train, withering the
flesh of mankind and drying to ashes the plants
that the women cling to as if they were links with
greener days. Visions of ice torture the mind ; memories
of long, cool drinks madden us. The wind drops as the
day declines, everything lies gasping; but at last, there,
low in the western sky, rises an inky cloud. The new-
chum hails it as a storm signal. But it is the surface of
the world on airy wheels, “ continents of dust” whirling
over the blistered earth. Redder than the sunset, bigger
than the Andes, the dust-storm looms immense in
the sky. An uncanny red light grows as the
dust hides the dying sun—the light of the photo.-
developing room. It is startling to the most ex-
perienced in dust-storms. On women it lies like a
warning of woe to come. A moan of wind is heard ; a
fiery breath strikes the few trees like a shiver; the
heavens are a deeper red ; it is dark in the houses, a
ripple of dust on a far hill is the advance guard of the
avalanche itself. A second or two and the hill is hidden
in a pall of dust; ten seconds more and the dust is on us,
and we lie buried miles deep in an ocean of grit that
smothers our bodies and chokes our souls. In an hour or
24 hours it may be gone, but our bodies and souls are left
red with it. But what does it matter to the Coast?
What do they care for the toilers of the West, for the
thirsty leagues that want the millions, wasted in Sydney,
for water storage? Some day Governments will awaken
and we shall find water conservation and irrigation come
first in Government policies, not elaborate railway
stations.
THE BARREN PRAYER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The land was under summer,
And the drought with cruel bands
Bound her life, and choked her life-tide
At the whirling of the sands ;
And the people cried to Heaven, and they cried with
lifted hands.
Sad the voices reached their Godhead,
Whom they called on in their pain ;
Echo-faint and thin with distance
Came the wailing back again.
And the bitter question burned them . . . must they call
their God—in vain ?
And a wisdom out of silence
Reached to each one in this wise :
“ He has answered ... as Gods answer,
And your prayers are His replies.
He is Self —but blood-unreddened,
Pulseless, dim, and blind and deadened ;
The Reflection of your Dreaming in the Mirror of the
Skies.”

The weekly despatch of the Brisbane
express from Redfern (Sydney) station on Sundays,
writes a correspondent, is an instance of official
conservatism. The long train with its two loco-
motives starts regularly from platform No. 8,
which is one of the shortest at Redfern, the train
being nearly twice as long. Consequently, the
front half has no platform alongside; intending
passengers farewelling friends, ticket collectors,
etc., have to trudge along the permanent way,
and clamber up to the carriages as best they can.
On Sundays most of the other platforms are
deserted, but tor some not apparent reason the
short one is always reserved for Brisbane express.

“ Mac.” : Was present last year at a
bush-shanty race meeting in the Riverina. The
crowd was lined up on either side of the track in
expectation of seeing the field for the big handicap
emerge from the scrub for the finish. Suddenly a
wild-eyed individual broke the line on one side,
rushed across to the other, and, singling out one
of the crowd, commenced to pound him. The
assaulted one resented this, and the fight raged all
over the track regardless of the horses. The race
finished a yard or two from the combatants, but
the fight continued uninterrupted, the local man
in blue entering into the sport with evident
appreciation. When the third round had con-
cluded the aggressor addressed himself to the
attacked. “So you’re the bloke wot dashed well bit

Months ago a cow, owned by a Richmond
River selector, had a stick, measuring 16£in. long
and l|in. in dia., driven through her ribs and into
her stomach ; to extract it baffled the bush vets.
The other day the point was seen bulging the hide
on the opposite side of the cow, when the stick
was removed in its entirety.
Not always, of course, but
generally the farmer who has
really ‘ ‘ worked ” his land has
pulled through even in the
droughty Mallee. Anybody who
likes to go through the latter
country and ask can find out
thatyi&s a rule, the least suc-
cessful of them have the rooted
belief that the more they break
up the surfaoe the more ‘ 1 play ”
the sun and wind have, and the
greater, therefore, the loss of
what little moisture it has laid
hold of. That is straight in
the teeth of all scientific prin-
ciples, of course; but the thing
has never before been worked
out so exactly as a German ex-
perimenter has done it. He
shows that a soil’s power to retain
moisture is in proportion to its
power to absorb it. Sand that
could absorb 25 per cent, of water,
lost by evaporation 88 - 4 per cent,
in 24 hours ; loam, absorbing 51
per cent., lost 45'7percent.; and
so on down to “ worked ” garden
soil, which took up 89 per cent,
and held all but 24 ’3 per cent.

“Scotty the Wrinkler” :
I can back up “Jimmy the

rungle I saw house-tea vilified;
we got a box by mistake in the
hut. It is like sherry to the
uneducated taste. “ Strong old
military ditto ” is the wine for
beer and rum-swillers. Billy and quart-pot teas
are good if you cover the billy and put the pint
on the “jack-shay,” but there’s nothing so good
as tea-pot tea; the aroma is there, and, for prefer-
ence, I like the old brown “singing Jenny.” The
threepenny separate pots, with bread, scone or
bun, in Melbourne and Sydney are delicious;
better than all the swell restaurant brews.

Writes “Kiwi”:
. P1 o e . a ? ed that “Ahau” (8., 13/12/’O2) takes such an in-
rerest in my remote ancestor, the moa. Doubtless Maori
tradition is unreliable; but there are inexistence moa
feathers which chiefs claim to be heirlooms from some
ancestor who hunted the great bird. Of the 14 varieties
remains of which have been found, some are very
ancient, even geologically (and geologists regard a million
years as a trifle in time). On the other hand, it seems
certain that some kinds have lived not many centuries
back. In Otago province moa bones have been found
practically on the surface, and well-preserved moa-eggs
have been found in the river gravels. A lagoon in South
Canterbury, when drained, gave up thousands of bones,
and 1 have seen skeletons, almost complete, dug up by
gold-seekers from the beds of gullies. I recollect two
instances in which the tendons were plainly visible on
the leg-bones, the claws and scaly coverings of the toes
and leg being as perfect as on the day the bird died. But
this was in limestone formation, where you would expect
better preservation than elsewhere. I have seen a lime-
stone cave strewn with bones, as if the birds had fled
thereto and died, and in one dry corner was one leg to
the upper part of which scanty feathers still adhered. It
is evident, therefore, that some varieties of moa have
lived not so very far back, though nowadays anybody’s
statement that he had seen a live moa would be classed
with sea-serpent yarns. We have other bird wonders,
however. For instance, there is the Notornis Mantelli!
of which only three or four specimens have been cap-
tured. The bird was believed to be quite extinct, but a
few years back a solitary specimen was caught in southern
Otago, and is now in Dunedin museum. This bird is very
like the pakeko (commonly called “ pukaki ”) or swamp
hen. the plumage being the same as that of the red-
headed or bald coot of Australia.

“ Chass ” : Re Cape-weed (“8.R.” B.
31/l/’O3). In Yic. like most imported flora this
plant thrives better than the indigenous vegetation
(everything Australian seems too tired to thrive).
It makes a valuable winter fodder, and, dying in
early spring, interfers little with the native
vegetation. Australian soils are deficient in
humus, and the agriculturist who knows his
business will encourage Cape-weed. Unlike Aus-
tralian plants it makes good growth during winter,
when there is plenty of moisture, and its broad rank
leaves and wool-like seeds form an ideal humus.
Have seen plants on fallow ground the size of an
umbrella. S.W. Vic. roads are a fine sight in
early spring, when Cape-weed lines them for
miles with bloom, having the appearance of broad
yellow ribbons.

If you could suddenly be provided with the ability to play
the piano perfectly, and to retain the ability without the necessity
of constant practice, would you not gladly pay £6O ?
The PIANOLA will provide this wonderful ability. It will
give to any one absolute control over the piano.
It will enable you to play your piano, although you may not
have played one note in your life.
No musical knowledge is necessary and the possessor of a
PIANOLA finds himself master of a technique greater than that
of any artist that ever lived.
Is it not worth while to consider the advisability of owning
a PIANOLA yourself 1 If you will write us, we will mail you
free a catalogue describing the instrument. When writing, ask
for Catalogue “ B.”
The price of the Pianola is £6O for prompt cash, or £65 on
moderate monthly payments.

The Inky Way.
In the late 50 8 and 60’s the Melb. Aon reporters were
the hardest-worked in the world. The maximum strength
of the staff was five members, and it was much oftener
four. At one time, for a couple of weeks, two reporters—
Howard Willoughby, now Argos editor, and H. J. Smith
afterwards Argos sub-editor—did all the work. With a
staff of five, one man’s duty was to report the two Nisi
Prius Courts, with the Banco, Insolvency and County
Courts, be ready to take the 7.30 p.m. “ turn " in Parlia-
ment and remain in the gallery till the rising of
the Assembly - usually 3 a.m. and later in those
days. The Age took as much “ copy ”as could be turned
out till 5 a.m. Only a few of the men were found to
stand the strain for more than six months. But it was a
fine all-round training for those who survived the ordeal.
As late as ’65, the Argus brought out an Assembly report
of 22 cols, with only five gallery hands 1 In these days of
short reports the journalistic scribe has a comparatively
easy time, though probably the worry has increased with
the diminution in the amount of labor. All the same, no
modern member of the Age reporting staff would say, as
a fellow scribe did to present writer in *63 : “I have*no
longer any fear of Hell flames ; a man who has put in six
months as an Age reporter must welcome death and Hell
with delight.”
* * * *
“ A.M.” : A recent “Inky Way” par (B. 3/l/*O3) refers
to the old times when Melb. Age used to waylay the early
edition of the rival Argus and crib the English news,
dressing up the pars and publishing them as originals
from their London correspondent. But you don’t men-
tion the dramatic episode of the guileless Argus editor
who, one day, issued a specially-prepared copy or two,
containing some weird and woolly sensational bits from
the old world, and contrived that one of these doctored
copies should fall into the hands of the Age. The Age
“ bit ” and duly republished the imaginings of the Argus
man. Then the exposure, which finished the thieving
tactics of the Age : it thereafter made shift to get its own
news from England.
• • • •
It is remarkable to what extent a newspaper will go in
“tabooing” words. Scarcely a daily paper in the Com-
monwealth will print the word “female,” and it is only
when she is guilty of some wrong-doing—say, on the
occasion of an appearance at the police-court—that they
will permit one of the weaker sex to be called “ woman.”
Melb. Argus once told, under the heading “A Lady
Miner,” how a muscular dame delved for the yellow
metal.
* • • •
Newest Australian paper has a rather good and original
name—the Eden Propeller. It is a very small paper
published at Eden (N.S.W.), and may one day be a very
large paper published at the seat of the Federal Govern-
ment.
• * » •
Wallace Nelson (ex-editor of the Westralian Worker)
wrote before his resignation : “ If, with my pre-
sent experience, I were about to choose a profession
and a career, I might elect to become a hangman, but I
certainly would not decide to be a Labor editor. And, if
I adopted the former profession, I am perfectly per-
suaded that my life would be more peaceful and pleasant
than it is at the present moment, and that a more cordial
feeling would exist between myself and the majority of
my clients than now exists between myself and some of
my readers. In fact, nothing prevents my present
position becoming utterly intolerable to me but my
undying love of the democratic movement, and a certain
sense of humor which enables me to get a lot of honest
amusement out of the follies of men.”
• * * *
Sydney D.T. lets the cat out of the bag with regard to
Fitzpatrick, one of the journalists knighted for his ser-
vices during the Boer war : —“ Mr. Fitzpatrick wields a
trenchant pen, and has done splendid literary work for
his side. Few of the exceptionally gifted magazine
writers can so cleverly phrase a half-truth, or know so
well what to leave unsaid.”
* * * 41
On the initiative of its King-st. rival, S.M. Herald has
now adopted a serial story, a weekly dog-article, an
evening edition, headings to the leading articles, sub-
headings to long reports— and the front-page summary
idea. It was really the Herald that died a while ago,
and it is the Echo only that survives.
» • • •
Australian editorships just now understood to be
vacant, or in process of being filled : Melbourne Arsus,
Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney Daily Telegraph, and
Sydney Star. Sydney Evening News has just taken a
new editor, and there are rumors of the resignation of the
Agb editor, who (lucky dog !) is understood to be in the
financial position to give up work. There is some talk,
as yet vague, of a new Sydney daily with ample capital.
The Australian Times, the projected Barton-Lyne morn-
ing paper, is never now heard of. The politicians breathed
on it and it died.
• • • •
In the present serious dearth of front-rank journalists
in Australia, newspaper proprietors should be able to see
the natural result of a long continued policy of false
economy. For some years now the tendency of journalists’
wages has been downward. Whilst proprietaries have
increased in riches and advertising grown enormously,
the ox whose task it is to tread out the corn has been
made to wear a closer muzzle. Whereas a really first-class
reporter used to be able to earn £lO a week he now finds
it very difficult to get £6. Once it was the aim to have
as many good writers on a staff as possible ; now the
average business management is constantly striving to
lessen the number of men with fair salaries. Young
talent used to be encouraged and to find mone-
tary recognition even before there was opportunity to
turn it to full advantage ; now a man may show brilli-
ance, care and enterprise and languish on a clerk’s salary,
because of a rule of thumb that there must be only so
many good positions, promotion to which must be by
seniority. The idea of creating a special position for a
promising man, or allowing him to make a special position
for himself, is rarely entertained in an Australian daily
paper office nowadays. Natural result is that the more
enterprising and progressive men have drifted away—to
journalism in England or America, or to some other
callings in Australia. Now, a chain of coincidences having
caused general retirements among front-rankers, several
great Australian dailies are in the undignified position
of vainly “ chasing round ” for literary help. (During the
last few weeks three papers, not one of which makes less
than £20,000 a year, have all been fiercely struggling for
the services of one man !) Yet in nearly every case there
are even now staff-members who would be well able to take
positions of responsibility had they been given a chance to
develop in the past. But the inexorable law that the
£4 a week man must remain a four-pounder until a £5 a
week man dies or resigns has done much to reduce
Australian journalism to the state of a stupidly-conducted
civil service. Some of the awkwardness of the position
they have created is now being felt by the commercial
proprietaries of more than one paper ; the full folly of
their policy they won’t recognise until an outsider, such
as Pearson or Harmsworth, or a local firm with money
and knowledge, starts competition on up-to date lines.
• • • •
The “ linesman ” is one of the economical institutions
of Australian daily papers. In other parts of the world
the “ linesman ” is well known, but is quite a different
sort of person. There he is entrusted with “special”
work—finding his own subjects as a rule—and, being
well paid per line, makes money easily. In Australia the
“ linesman ” is given the small drudgery of the office,
and is paid by the inch (sometimes at less than a penny a
line). To him falls the chronicling of suburban municipal
councils and police courts, little parson gatherings, and
so on. At least, they fall to him when Parliament is in
session and the staff members are doing their 14 hours a
day pretty regularly. That is the linesman’s harvest
time and he may make quite £3 a week. But when Par-
liament rises and there is a danger that the staff members
won’t be kept busy enough, the linesman often finds
much of his occupation gone, his little meetings being
apportioned among the salaried staff, who might reason-
ably expect easy times during Parliamentary vacation.
Mr. Richard Warren, proprietor of Beech worth (Vic.)
Ovens and Murray Advertiser, has just celebrated his
half-century of journalism in the old-time mining town,
around which still cling so many memories of the
“roaring” days. The O. and M. A. is published tri-
weekly, retains many of the early-day journalistic charac-
teristics, and forms a link between the old miners of the
extensive district around and the new order of things
mining
• • * *
Highly virtuous excuse of a N.S.W. country paper for
its absence of outside news, and for chronicling, with
much circumstance, the inflamed state of the eorn on the
toe of the local Alderman Smith : —“ Many readers may
question the need to detail a family trouble like this,
caused, we believe, by an accident. But we think it is
better to detail such local troubles as this, rather than to
have our families read (as they must in the dailies) the
unsavory details of Saxon royal scandals, and such
cases." And, when you come to think of it, the state of
the local alderman’s toe should be of more import to the
virtuous than the vagaries of degenerate foreign royal
persons.

Robert Barr fathers the statement that a smart news-
paper proprietor in Scotland or England always advances
the salary of a staff member who gets married —being
confident that, as a married man, he will give more time
to the office than as a celibate. Probably a wise enough
conclusion. On the other hand, a man who is really in
earnest over his paper can’t marry without committing
bigamy. One of the manage d trois is generally neglected :
and it isn’t, as a rule, the paper.

David Syme, of Melb. Age, who has been touring
Maoriland, complained piteously to a reporter about M.L.
press taking its Australian politics from Sydney instead
of from Melbourne. He also bemoaned the paucity of
Australian news in M.L. papers. Which means that he
will try to rattle up the Maoriland Press Association in
the matter.
“ L. W.” : Saw this in a tram :
The tram was a “ corridor ” one, and there were myself
and a big, red-faced, crusty individual in it, besides the
father, the mother and the infant. The infant wanted to
walk up and down the car, and the mother wished it to
sit on her lap. The kid howled, and the fond father said
it must be allowed to walk. Both its hands were covered
with barley-sugar, and it supported itself along the seat,
carefully doubled the promontory made by the red-faced
man’s knees, and left as a danger-signal the imprint of
five sticky fingers on the beautiful grey surface of his
pants. The mother rushed forward and prevented it
getting outside, and once more tried to nurse it. It
howled, and the father again insisted upon its right to do
as it liked, and while the kid toddled up and down and
plastered barley-sugar all along the seats for the future
destruction of pants and frocks, the father gazed at it
with idiotic pride, and the mother rushed backwards and
forwards picking the little wretch up every time it fell.
At last, a lurch of the tram round a corner sent mother
and kid into a heap on the red-faced man’s toe, and the
kid was between the mother and the boot. As soon as
they were sorted out, the red-faced man beamed all over,
and inquired anxiously if the little something’s neck was
broken. Being told it was not, he expressed keen disap-
pointment, and, after carefully spreading a paper on the
edge of the seat, he sat down beside the fond male parent
and gave him a large and well-pickled portion of his mind.
The parent was a small, fierce man, and the adviser was a
large, angry man, and I had great hopes of a free enter-
tainment ; but the small, fierce man only ground his
teeth and " sed nuffin’."
“Shellback ” in regard to shipping accidents:—
It is time that the old fiction re the master’s and mate’s
authority was abolished. Were either to give an order in
harbor to stop work and turn out a boat for drill for even
a quarter of an hour, such a storm of abuse would be
hurled at the head of the officer responsible by his
clerical superiors, that for ever and a day he would be
only too glad to leave boats and such like alone. That is
provided he was not served with the “ sack ” instanter.
The pleasant fiction of the master’s supreme authority
exists largely on paper and when anything serious occurs.
At all other times, when things are running smoothly, the
ship’s internal economy is largely directed from the office.
This notion of supreme authority arose in- days long
passed, before the era of agents ; then the shipmaster
was a power, inasmuch as he was his employer’s own
agent in foreign ports. Nowadays his hands are tied to
an extent of which the public has little conception, but
the supreme-authority fiction still remains.
Regarding surveys, Vic. M.L.A. Sangster stated quite
recently in the House that the surveys as at present con-
ducted are largely a farce ; and he is perfectly right.
While the surveying is in progress no ship should be
allowed to carry on her ordinary work, but should be
taken to the nearest convenient space of open water, and
there put through an exhaustive trial of every- portion of
her equipment, engines included. Boats should be all
swung out and lowered, and fire and boat drill actually
carried out to the satisfaction of the surveyor. The
imposing Doat-station lists exhibited in most passenger
ships are for passengers’ benefit mostly. Crews are
always undergoing changes, and the odds are that half
the non-effective members of the crew (cooks, stewards,
firemen, greasers, etc.) would, at a sudden call, not
know their proper stations.
One or two other desirable changes might with
advantage be introduced. No ship, whether steam or sail,
carrying passengers should be allowed to leave port
with less than 12 seamen on deck. Crews as at pre-
sent carried are enough so long as the unexpected
does not happen ; it is at Buch times that the
paucity of numbers tells, and the death-roll is
swollen by a want of sufficient labor to effectively
handle the life-saving appliances. Further, no
officer or seaman should at any time have anything
to do with the handling of cargo, other than rigging
gear for the working of same. These reforms
would, of course, entail considerable expense,
and probably many small shipowners would go
to the wall, and a very desirable end to most of
them. Ultimate effect would be to strengthen
the hands of those who do their best to comply
with the law, both in the spirit and letter, in
sending their ships to sea in a thoroughly sea-
worthy condition.
The practice of deck-loading is also a
rapidly growing evil. Few, if any, of the
vessels trading on this coast are fitted for deck
loads (the Yankee lumber schooners being the
only craft designed for this purpose), and yet
it is a common sight to see vessels leaving port
with scarce a vestige of deck space visible.

Sick and Nervous Headaches Relieved.
Sick and nervous headaches may aptly be classed
amongst the most distressing complaints that fall
to the lot of mankind. Bile Beans, by going
direct to the root of the evil—disordered liver and
digestive organs—have proved singularly success-
ful in curing these headaches, the latest illustra-
tion of which comes from Mrs. S. A. Masters, of
18 Jarrett-street, Leichhardt, Sydney. This lady
says:—“l have found your Bile Beans are an
excellent remedy for a disordered liver. At times
I have been so bad with indigestion that I did not
know what to eat. M y appetite was considerably
impaired, and although at nights I have felt like
having a good sleep, I could not do so, and in con-
sequence, felt completely done up during the day,
and suffered agony with, sick and nervous head-
aches. I was induced to take your medicine by
seeing an advertisement wherein Bile Beans had
cured a fellow sufferer, and can now say from my
own experience, that Bile Beans are a perfect
remedy for sick headache, loss of appetite, sleep-
lessness, and those innumerable symptoms of a
sick liver. I would now use no other medicine,
and always keep a box at hand for an emergency.”
Bile Beans have now a world wide reputation f®r
curing biliousness, headache, indigestion, constipa-
tion, piles, debility, female weaknesses, nervous-
ness, bad blood, pimples and all skin eruptions,
bad breath, anaemia, loss of appetite, sleeplessness,
summer fag, &e. Bile Beans are obtainable from
all medicine vendors, price Is. l|d. or 2s. 9d- large

POLITICAL
POINTS
At Warringa Ward, North Sydney, in
which there is one public-house, the total number
of votes at recent local option poll was two.
The Philp Government refused white
people an extension of time for sending in their
income-tax returns, but allowed an extra week to
the Cairns Chows.
Reid was starting to attack Kingston, at
the meeting in Adelaide Town Hall, when voices
cried out, “Good old Charley ! ” and a chorus of
cheers came, which quite disconcerted the orator.
The bounceabie Cohentingenter proposes
to sue the Queensland Government also for extra
pay which wasn’t in the agreement, and Australia
begins to feel very dead tired of its Cohentin-
genter.
The angry niutterings of the poor Queens-
lander against the poll-tax clause in Philp’s
income-tax law is frightening the followers of the
Boodlewraith. The timorous ones are pleading
that they didn’t know it was loaded ; the brazen
ones assert that it was solely the doing of the hated
Labor party.
The death of Charles Gavan Duffy relieves
the Vic. Government of its longest and costliest
pensioner. Duffy was a queer specimen of the
fervid Irish patriot living in England, as a
K.C.M.G., and drawing £lOOO a year, the fruits of
early V ictorian politic al jobbery. He held office for
two years under a pension provision of the Con-
stitution Act, which was afterwards abolished.
Will the time ever come when persons
domiciled in a country will, on leaving it, take
with them, as a legally enforceable liability, their
proportion of the public debt contracted while
they were so domiciled ? Not altogether inequit-
able when carefully looked into, for there are
hordes of people who arrive in countries when big
loans are making things hum, and who leave them
for other successful borrowing countries when the
time comes to pay up and suffer.
Writes Mr. A. H. Griffith, M.L.A. :
Dear Ed. Bulletin. —The following (unreported)
resolution, moved by myself, was carried by a big
majority at N.S.W. Labor Conference last year :
“ That this conference desires to express its utter
disapproval of the evident intention of the Impe-
rial Government to foster the spirit of militarism
in Australia by filling the posi-
tions of State Governors with
military and naval officers.”
The suspicion voiced by this
resolution is amply justified
by a recent article in the
Times, quoted, with approval,
by the D.T. London corres-
pondent: “The Times trusts
that the choice of a successor
to Lord Hopetoun will fall
Upon a man not less highly
qualified than the present
Governors of Victoria and
N.S.Wv undoubtedly are, to
inspire colonial opinion with
sound views on Federal
policy in relation to Imperial
defence." Said “sound
views ” mean, of course, ap-
proval of General Hutton’s
plan of getting Australia to
keep on hand soldiers ready
to rush off to any part of
the globe to collect the bad
debts of London money-
lenders, or to collar gold mines
for them, plus Mr. Barton’s aide
of taxing Australia to keep a
British squadron in time of peace,
which in case of war would be
free to clear off to defend Hong
Kong or Capetown.
Here is the dictation test to
which one, Fattydeen, a Hindoo,
was subjected in Dubbo (N.S.W.),
he being a prohibited immigrant
found in the Commonwealth:—
The publication of a new book by this
philosopher in his 82nd year bears wit-
ness once more to the intense vitality
which has enabled him to carry out his self-ini-
posed task of outlining a complete synthetic philosophy
under difficulties that only one man in a century can
overcome.
Of course he failed, as he was expected to fail;
and soon the Commonwealth will be relieved of
his presence. If he had been a desirable person,
required for technical reasons to pass the test, he
might have been tried with :
Sam had a cat; and this cat was a good cat. It chased
rats and mice and never stole Sam’s milk, &c., &c.
That’s the beauty of the Act. It is a Nasmyth
hammer, which can come down with 50-ton
severity or with soz. gentleness, as the case re-
quires.
M‘Kenzie, the resigned Minister of Lands
for Vic,, expressed himself as “ astounded ” at the
adverse report on his administration of the depart-
ment, seeing that “nothing was brought out
beyond what he stated in Parliament himself.”
What a commentary on the average politician’s
conception of honesty and fair dealing ! M'Kenzie
was quite unconscious of the fact that his state-
ments in the House proclaimed him unfit to hold
liis position. Also, Premier Irvine and others who
heard the statement went out of their way to
remark that M‘Kenzie’s integrity would doubtless
be proved spotless. All things considered, it is
surprising that the committee didn’t award
M'Kenzie a gold medal.
Alex. Peacock feels keenly his recent
defeat by Robert Reid for the Senate, particu-
larly as he had been assured of a certain majority
of six. He says he will beat Reid next Dec.,
when the seat faces a popular verdict, by two to
one ; and unless the man with the laugh has gone
off very much, this is no over-estimate. The
other three retiring Senators are rather glad of
this, as it removes two dangerous competitors
from their arena.
Mr. Yes-No Reid, returned from Westralia,
announces that nine out of every ten of the
people there are freetraders. They must be, then,
freetraders after his own tongue, for, not satisfied
with the Federal system of Protection, they take
full advantage of the leave granted to them by the
constitution to set up a second system of Protec-
tion against the other States; and, further, arrange
their railway rates so as to establish a third
barrier against importations from outside.
Melb. Argus babbles with humorous in-
consistency and vagueness on the subject of Fat-
man’s legislative stronghold. “Members of the
Council rightly claim that their House never
stood higher than it does now in the esteem of the
community.” The statement appears quite true—
but what if it is? The mere assurance that a
thing so utterly despised as Victoria’s House of 48
Rich Landlords has been quite as much despised
all along doesn’t help things to any visible extent.
Sydney D.T. prepares to attack the system
of old age pensions in N.S.W. It announces an
“impartial” inquiry into the system, and gives
the impartiality away first go-off with the state-
ment —
The Act has now been in operation sufficiently long to
enable an impartial inquirer to obtain some valuable con-
clusions as to its effect on the community. No part of
the world is now more lavish in its expenditure for the
aged than this State, but there is a strong opinion that
we have gone too far in this direction, and that some im-
portant amendments in the Act are imperatively neces-
sary.
Charles Gavan Duffy, father of the Vic.
Land Act (1862), died whilst the M'Kenzie
inquiry committee was preparing its report on
the tactics of that up-to-date Minister of Lands.
To understand the partial futility of Duffy’s wise
legislation one has only to read Duffy’s Guide to
the Land Law (1863) in the light of the M'Kenzie
committee of 40 years later. In 1877 Duffy told
the Leg. Assembly—“ I travelled through Gipps-
land from Briagolong to Cowwar, a district called
the granary of the East. I afterwards visited
Bruthen, &c., and in all these places I was assured
by legions of prosperous farmers who possess the
soil that they obtained their homesteads under
what has been named the Duffy Land Act. And
why have we not happy homes, possessed by a
free, manly, yeoman proprietary, in the West as
well as in the East ? Because the very class for
whom we legislated sold their inheritance for
some paltry bribe.”
MIGHT BE SEIZED FOR DEBT.
CANDID FRIEND : “ What a beastly-fitting coat
you wear, old fellow. Why don’t you return
it and have it altered?”
THE OTHER FELLOW: “I mightn’t get it back.”
N.S.W. Premier See does not see the
necessity of appointing a Federal High Commis-
sioner :
While the States possess the powers and rights they
now hold, such an official is unnecessary. He could not
do the work for the different States that the Agents-
General now carry out. ... As long as we have our
rights, which to us as States are more important than the
rights of the Commonwealth, we must have our separate
representatives in London.
In brief, the diseased self-importance of State
Premiers makes a continuance of the present
system necessary. If Premier See takes it into
his head to spread his K.C.M.G. tail-feathers in
the drawing-rooms of the London semi-great, he
will find a N.S.W. Agent-General a handier
advance-agent than a Commonwealth High Com-
missioner.
OPENINGS OF ONE KIND AND
ANOTHER.
The Victorian Council of Churches has resolved to
approach the State Governor and protest against the
opening on Sunday of the exhibition of British pictures.
This is the only kind of opening the rev. gentle-
man considers suitable for Sabbath exhibition.
The first Victorian Payment of Members
Bill could only be got through Parliament by
allowing the House of Rich Landlords to have
the .£3OO a year as well as the Lower House.
Every M.L.C. drew the pay during the three
years in which the measure had operation. Only
one member of the popular Chamber —George
Higinbotham—neglected to take his monthly
cheque.
A dramatic episode chanced in Vic.
Assembly last week, when Cameron, on behalf of
the absent M'Kenzie, presented a petition from
the holy, praying that the request of the trustees
to be allowed to open the National Gallery on
Sunday afternoons be not granted. And the item
immediately preceding this outbreak of M ‘Kenzie’s
piety was the scathing report of the committee on
M‘Kenzie’s doings as Lands Minister. It was a
horrible mistake to thus remind the public that
Sabbatarianism rests mostly on men like
M'Kenzie.
Judging from his own admissions, Vic. ex-
Lands Minister M‘Kenzie’s real complaint seems
to be that very common one among business men
—a conscience so blunted by the immorality of
business life as to be regardless, to an extent, of
right and wrong. This disqualifies him, as it dis-
qualifies most successful business men, from being
safely entrusted with any great public duties where
public interests and private interests may by any
possibility conflict. Men such as he are an ordi-
nary product of commercial ideals and the com-
petitive system.
What Ons Land says is doubtless quite
true: that Christian de Wet’s deputation to
Chamberlain represented the great majority of
the burghers—the burghers who made so gallant
a fight for freedom. It is idle to talk to such
men as the Boers, to whom Independence has
been as life-breath, of reconciliation and the
glories of the Empire. They view and to the
end will view, Bull-Cohen as a robber, who having
deprived them of the assets, after which he so
long lusted, calmly offers them a junior partner-
ship therein, after appointing himself permanent
managing director.
That most unsavory revelation about the
flogging of young officers of the British army by
their seniors, who hold secret and unofficial courts-
martial upon them, led to one curious result.
Sydney Telegraph proceeded to explain that the
system was quite common and well-known and of
long standing in both army and navy, and called
it “ admirable,” and, in effect, desired to know
what possible objection could be taken to it.
Well, come to think of it, what objection can be
taken ? For that matter, what objection can be
taken to the flogging of daily paper editors by the
board of directors ?
Westralian Freetraders now recognise th
Reid’s mission was a blunder. They had
sion of the field, local Senators and Representa-
tives, bar John Forrest, being mostly Freetraders.
They had nothing to gain and everything to lose
by stirring the matter up. The result was that
public attention for the first time centred on the
fiscal question. Latent Protectionist feeling was
brought to the surface. The two leading papers
in the capital have, for the first time, declared in
favor of a Protectionist policy, and the feeling is
general that next Federal elections will be the
funeral of a good many of the present nonentities.
Another scandal in Victoria is by way of
being smothered with great difficulty. Anstey,
M.L.A., having moved for a return of those
members who owe rent to the Lands Department,
Irvine replied that a lot of people were back in
their rent and it would be unfair to specialise
members of Parliament. Then Anstey moved for
a return showing the names of all defaulters. The
Govt, and House assented, but Irvine casually
intimated that it would take several months to
prepare the information. By that time —who
knows ? Significant that until a few years back
such a return was annually published in the Govt.
Gazette. Who stopped it, and why ?
Judge Real, in a land-rental appeal case
at Brisbane lately, said the law was that “the
tenant must be maintained by the land, otherwise
it had no rental value.” Which is a common-
sense view of the case—-providing, of course, the
land has been given reasonable opportunities.
Victorian House of Landlords really
ne3dn’t worry about trying to abolish the system
of free education. Slipshod ad ninistration is
gradually killing it. An Age par. from Dimboola:
For over three years the Board has been agitating for
the erection of a school at Tarranyurk railway station,
and this has been promised, but delayed from time to
time on various excuses. One parent told the members
of the Board that not one of her children, the eldest
being eleven years, had ever had a day’s schooling
through no school being nearer than seven miles, and
that there were 28 other children of school age in that
district who were also debarred from attending school.
It looks really pretty to see the name of
“R. H. Lascelles” —of the big Geelong wheat-
dealing firm of Denny, Lascelles and Co., and
lessee of a huge slice of the Mallee —at the foot of
a piteous wail in Melb. Age at the niggardliness
of the Irvine Govt, in declining to carry seed-
wheat free. The poor farmer (Lascelles ap-
parently now calls himself such) gets £6O worth
of seed-wheat advanced him by the State, he gets
special concessions in freight on his manures and
his wheat crop, he gets greatly reduced “starving
stock rates,” and he wants —well, only the Lord
knows the real depth of his requirements. He
hasn’t so far suggested that Irvine and Bent
should send up men to plough his land and sow
his crop gratis, but that will come.
Sydney D.T.’s miserably servile attitude
to the foreign money-lender:—
Beyond that, the Commonwealth has itself done much
to irritate British interests since Federation was in-
augurated. Incidents like those of the detention of the
hatters, the hostile steps, taken and promised, against
Anglo-Australian shipping, and the prosecutions of Anglo-
Australian mercantile houses have all exercised their
effect.
This, apropos of the blessed difficulty now being
experienced in putting the country more into
pawn ! Then, to placate Shylock, Australia is to
allow importers of English hatters to show a
haughty contempt for our laws, English tramp
steamers to ruin our local carrying industry, and
English swindlers to rob our oustoms? Could
even the Owe’Sullivan reckon a borrowing policy
good at that price ?
About the quaintest thing Australia has
heard of for a long time is the indignant denial of
Westralian Treasurer Gardiner that he is execu-
ting public works out of the revenue surplus, and
his honest and infuriated assurance that he is
borrowing the money in the good old way. Some
one accused Gardiner of not borrowing all the
money for public works, and Gardiner repudiated
the charge as if it were a leper or a serpent and
said: —
Our loan obligations are being financed on a basis dis-
tinctly outside of our revenue, and we have accrued in
our Treasury chest at the present time, a larger sum
than we have had there for many, many, long, long
months.
If Gardiner had only recovered libel damages
from the ruffian who charged him with -not
borrowing enough money the joke would be com-
plete.
Some of the amenities of the Federal trip
to Westralia are now coming out:—
The enjoyment of the party was greatly increased by a
duel between Geo. Reid and R. A. Grouch, a Geelong rep.
Crouch opened fire in an interview on one of Reid’s
speeches, and said that the jolly and fat man’s criticisms
of the Vic. worker and factory-girl reminded him of “ the
brass smile reflected by the name-plate on a coffin,” and
further, that Reid never gave lectures but select burlesque
entertainments. A column of this sort of thing reached
Reid at Kalgoorlie on a Sunday. The Freetrade crowd had
a two hqurs conference, and Reid wired to the Perth paper
a column of defence, calling Crouch “ a small frv,” “a Pro-
tectionist fledgling,” and “a political innocent.” Neither
party went to church that night, and, as they stayed at
the same hotel, glares were frequent. Then the Wrst
Australian telegraphed another column to Perth from,
Crouch, in which he offered Reid a letter of introduction,
to Harry Rickards, called him the Australian Barnum,.
and hurt Mr. Reid’s feelings very much indeed. Fortu-
nately at this stage the steamer India arrived and took
off one of the parties, so no blood was shed.
Lyne put up a good fight against Reid in
W.A. The Dry Doggist got in first what time
Lyne and Forrest were opening the water scheme.
But then Lyne came along, and, supported by
Forrest, Premier James, Jenkins Iscariot, Opposi-
tion-leader Nanson and others, followed, with
unexpected success, in Reid’s track, and had
crowded meetings in Perth, Fremantle, Kalgoor-
lie, the Boulder, Coolgardie, and Northam. Long
Bill surprised his opponents and delighted his-
friends by a series of practical speeches which,
after the buffooning of Reid’s meetings, made a
good impression. Reid’s mission petered out very
badly in the end At the farewell shivoo to
George, the hall was only half-filled, and, recog-
tising that there had been too much foolery, the
wner of the Arid Dog tried to make a dignified
Speech on the old, threadbare subject. Result:
eneral weariness and half the scanty audience
left in the middle of the proceedings.
An enraged Oppositionist writes from
Tasmania: —
The early downfall of the Tas. Ministry is foreshadowed
by the fact that Premier Lewis looks like being a home-
less outcast in his own country. Lewis’s ancient pocket
borough (Richmond) has been swallowed up in the recent
redistribution of seats consequent upon the reduction of
members, and neither of the two constituencies con-
cerned in the partition of Richmond will have Lewis at
any price. Monmouth, Sorell, Devonport, and other
country constituencies were each prospected in turn, but
none of them panned out a color in favor of Lewis.
Evidently relying upon his title and whatever prestige
the Premiership may still carry, he has at last decided to
try for Central Hobart, but as his opponent in Central
Hobart is a leading Oppositionist, barrister Nicholls, a
popular fighter, who has at his back whatever progres-
siveness there is in the politics of the Isle of Dreams —and
as Premier Lewis is neither a fighter nor progressive, nor
anything but a dull Tory person, whose personal inoffen-
siveness is sadly discounted by his connection with an
unpopular Government, he seems likely to drop sud-
denly out of Parliament with a sickening thud.
Plainly it is a serious thing to outrage the finer
feelings of Tasmania with an income-tax, as Lewis
did.

lni]g3stion Conquered Again by
VITADATIO
———
Mr. S. A. PALMER.
Dear Sir,—l had been a srreat sufferer from indigestion
for five or six years, with headaches, giddiness, heavy
and oppressed feelinys. Added to these about eight
months ago severe pains seized one of inv legs from the
knee downwards, and became a source of real agony to
me, destroying my rest at nights, and causing me worry
and trouble during the day. After much pain and
anxiety l called at your Adelaide office about four months
ago, and as the result decided to try Vitadatio. and I
took four bottles. It is now three months since I finished
the last bottle, and I am so pleased to say that the
excruciating pain has entirely left my leg. 'The head
aches and oppressed feelings have disappeared. 1 am
able to enjoy food that I dared not touch before, and feel
very thankful for what Vitadatio has done for me. You
may mention my name to any inquirer who may be
interested, and who may desire relief such as I have
obtained.

Personally, said Chamberlain, in a re-
cent speech, “I am sanguine of the union of
South Africa, and I have found that many things
have the curious habit of happening much as I
expected. The Jamieson raid, for instance ?
Noteworthy that the Htematin-Albumin Tablets
—invaluable for anaemia, blood-poverty, and kindred
troubles—are subjected, in process of preparation to a
temperature of over 212 Fahr ; and, beiim thus com-
pleteiy sterilised, cannot convey any blood-infection.
These tablets are now being successfully used--in con-
junction with a milk-diet—in the treatment of consutnD-
imi, by Dr Lang, on associate of Prof. Finsen, the
inventor of the preparation.* lne
The greatest relief from pain may be at once
experienced by the wearing for a few hours nightlv of
the Freeman and Wallace Electric “Invigorator” Belt
which is used by leading Scientists in Europe Local
certificates prove its superiority over all other forms of
Electric Belts,” and testimonies of efficacy declare it to
be singularly curative in the treatment ami cure of grave
nerve and blood diseases. A testimony recently received
by the Specialists of the Institute, from the lion Daniel
0 Connor, M.P., appears in the firm’s advertisement,
■striking cures of many so called incurable diseases are
effected daily by the adoption of these Electro-Medical
methods, and the cheapness of the “ Invigorator,” which
is sold for One Pound only, is not the least item in a
system which revo utionizes the science of medicine and
appeals alike to rich and poor.— Advt.

E. D. Miii,bn, senator and squatters’ agent,
writes a couple more columns to the friendly
S.M. Herald “to advance reasons for a further
reduction * of Western (N.S.W.) pastoral rents.
Thk Bulletin feels a lot of sympathy for the
western squatter; but this sort of thing prows
tiresome. The solid truth is that the squatter’s
undoubtedly heavy losses have commanded for
urn deep public sympathy, wherefore nobody has
nan pluck enough to protest even when he or his
agent has made extravagant requests. All the
influence has been directed to making tilings easy
for the tenant; for the State (the landlord)
hardly a word has been spoken. And
the State just now needs a few “barrackers”
quite as badly as the average squatter does. Any-
how, the facts ought to be stated plainly ; and
the squatters agent. Senator or otherwise, seldom
does that. The Western Lands Board has lately
cut down rents, provisionally, 25 per cent, on the
average (in bad cases the cut has been a lot
an 1 Mr - M[UjEN Sf W s that, though this
might have been a fair reduction in ’85 or ’89 (the
Western boom years), it is not fair now because
the country has deteriorated very much since then.
1 rue; and so have the rents. In ’94 an Act was passed
to allow of a special reappraisement; and the
rents and license fees were then reduced, in some
cases nO per cent.—in a few cases more. That
isn t the only cut either ; some of the rents have
been cut three times since ’85, and, besides, the
holders have had other concessions. With a clear
conscience, and feeling that it has been a remark-
ably generous landlord, the public may now pretty
safely leave the business to the Western Land
Board, which was appointed for the purpose
*or a time, no doubt, it will be hard for the
Western mendicant to get out of his habit of being
a pathetic applicant at the public’s front door, but
he will get over even th'-f in firne.
Bill Lytie, of is.*. >> t proposes that the
I eneral Constitution should be amended so as to
ov L de iatl P e deral capital must be in
iN.a.W., but to cut out the proviso that it must
not be within 100 miles of Sydney. The idea
fc „P romt , 11 was Premier Reid, of
W S. W., who first demanded that Brisbane.
Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide, Perth, and all
other towns outside N.S.W., should be disqualified
as possible Federal capitals. The other States
assented on a condition, and it is impossible to get
rid ot the condition without abrogating the whole
clause. Australia wants, above all things, a
federal capital where the soil can be owned by
the people, and it is hardly possible to get that
within 100 miles of Sydney—the cost of resump-
tion would be too high. It certainly doesn’t
want the federal expenditure to increase land
values for the benefit of the private landlords
of Sydney or any other city-and that is appar-
ently what Mr. Lyne aims at.
Victoria is the home of the lone and
ancient miser. Scarcely a month passes without
some solitary old character dying in his hut-
very often he has been dead a week or two before
his remains are found—and the inventory of
jus effects pans out for some ancient hats, a
battered cooking utensil or two, some venerable
tweed clothes, a pick and prospecting dish, an
earthen floor, a tottering bunk, a shapeless dog
ete a - tage{ i nd -'f'fiable breed, and about
tlOOO in cash and mo i ities. The latest hermit
who passed away ... this fashion was William
Uavis of Inglewood, aged 70, who was drowned in
a few inches of water through sheer inability to
hold up his grey head any longer. He was even
dirtier and more reticent than the average recluse,
so he naturally yielded a larger return ; the hovel
wlierein he had mooned away his declining years
canon 30 k s s °dtary bit of bacon contained over
£.1000 in cash and good securities. They are
mostly old diggers, these ancient Victorian
hermits ; and when the present crop dies out it is
not likely to be replaced.
Lionel Fegan, M.L. A., denies that he ran
for the vacant billet of N.S. W. State Minister for
«n S j < i e ' , hat Lillet would certainly be better
tilled by the average layman than by the average
lawyer, but the layman wants to be a man of
capacity. Somehow. Fegan gets the credit of
running for most vacancies with fixed salaries
attached.
The bowled-out Lands Minister M'Kenzie
fell from his high estate, or rather, was found out in
his low estate, because of his hard Scotchbyterian
desire to drive a successful bargain. This was
one of the worst features of the case, but the com-
ri"ttee restricting itself closely to M‘K<nzie as
.Lands Munster, did not touch on it. The com-
mittee took no cognisance of the fact that when
M Kenzie secured important grazing blocks for
himself and his son he was at the same time chair-
man of the starving stock committee for the State.
At the very time he was professing to do all in I113
power to help the people with starving stock .to
find grass, he was not only mopping up grass
wholesale, but was providing himself and his son
with opportunities to take advantage of the stress
of these unfortunate people by buying up their
stock at extremely low prices. In his own evi-
dence M‘Kenzie admitted that his son had got
land with a view to purchasing starving stock in
order to make a few hundred pounds out of tin*
bargain.
An indignant letter from Maoriland :—
Premier Seddon claims the late elections in Maort-
land as showing conclusively that the people endorse
my Imperial and domestic policy.” Apart from the
implied reflection on his colleagues, who are, theoreti-
cally at least, supposed to partly own. the polio} - , it is
pure Seddonese to state that the electors, when they
Novemher 25th, cared two straws about
Richard s ridiculous Himperialism. Politics in Maori-
iand are, and have for some time been, if not as dead as
the moa, at least as flat as stale beer. Things are fairly,
prosperous, and as the so-called Opposition is in favor of
tne new Seddon policy of borrowing and spending - , the
average elector could see no reason for a change of
Government. As for Seddon’s boasted Imperialism,
scarcely anyone in_ the State professes to know exactly
what it means. None of the other Ministers ever talk
about it, and the great boss has himself learned enough
of late to realise that the public badly need a rest,
although about the sensibilities of his colleagues he
appears to be as callous as ever. Recently he visited the
State coal mine on the West Coast, and kicked up a hefty
row because things were not moving quite fast enough to
pi ease him. Next day it was wired to the press that
Air. Seddon had given orders that things must be
expedited, etc. The duty of attending to the coal mine
belonged to the Minister of Mines who, however, seems
meek enough to tolerate Seddon’s interference with his
department. This is just on a par with the great Maori
Volunteer scheme which Seddon unfolded at Papawai
when he made that now notorious speech to the natives
He declared that there was to be a Maori force
of volunteers officered and “run” entirely bv
Maons. Incidentally he informed the excited brown
men that he and the M.L. Commandant had discussed the
question coming along that day in the train, and he had
determined to adopt it. Not one word about the scheme
haying been before Cabinet, or to show that he had sub-
mitted such a proposal to his colleagues in anv way
Ilowever, shortly afterwards, Ward made a decidedly antil
Jingo speech at Mossgiel, and so far riot a step has been
taken towards carrying out the great Papawai “ policy ”
And another great “policy” is becoming deader every
day—-that of a general annexation of the South Sea
Islands and the making of a Maori Commonwealth. No
one hears of it any longer, and most people forget that it
ever existed. ®

The secret of the success which has attends! the treatment of uric ailments by
Warner’s Safe Cure
is that the medicine acts in a scientific
mannae. It is a specific cure fog all diswywa of the
KIDNEYS AND LIVER.
So intimate is the relation between the functions of the kidneys and those of the liver that it is
necessary, in order to cure any disorder of either of those organs, to employ an agent which possesses
an equally curative action on each. In other words, when the kidneys are sick, the liver is sick also
and the contrary is likewise true. Warner’s Safe Cure is the only known remedy which possesses the
remarkable property of being of equal efficacy in cases of diseases of the kidneys and diseases of the
liver. By establishing a healthy and vigorous action of both the kidneys and the liver, Warner’s Safe
Cure cures not only all diseases due to uric poisoning, but Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice
rr -?; c , , Ansemia and Debility which are all caused by the liver failing to deal
efficiently with the biliary waste products of the used up tissues of the body.
Mrs. A. J. L. Barnett, Brighton Road, Glenelg, S.A., says:—‘‘l suffered greatly from my
kidneys and liver, and after consulting several doctors and getting no relief, I had given up all hope
of reoovery when I heard of Warner’s Safe Cure. After taking one bottle I was much relieved and
after taking four bottles, I am pleased to say, was entirely cured.”
The commonest first symptom of kidney disease is Fain in the back. A surer test is to place
some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass and let it stand until next morn-
ing. If it is then cloudy or there is a briek-dust like sediment or if particles float about in it, then
the kidneys are not healthy, and Warner’s Safe Cure should be taken immediately or Brights’ Disease
or some serious illness will result.
A treatise containing full particulars relating to Warner’s Safe Cure, and the diseases it cures,
together with many accounts of remarkable recoveries, will be sent free on application by H. H.

Business, Robbery, etc.
Pomlm : An American firm, a couple of
years back, took to U.S.A. patterns of Victorian makes of
complete harvesters that were not protected by patents
in these States, and they are now manufacturing them in
America. Some have even been imported to Victoria
and are doing good work. They are made almost entirely
of steel and iron, whereas Australian makers use wood
for their main-frames. In one district, three machines
are at work under the observation of an expert, with an
eye to possible improvements. In a few years the U.S.
firms will have exploited not only the brain-labor of many
years of the Australian makers, but also the only line of
manufacturing goods at present free from ruinous com-
petition. If this tired community returns the Dry Dog
to power next session, the thing will be done—Australian
States will be the shells and the Yanks will have sucked
another oyster. Apropos, Victorian Yankee firms have
circularised their agents, advising 1 an increase of over 25
per cent, on their machinery, owing to rise in price of
iron in America. Pity that Australians, with so much
coal and ironstone locally available, should be dependent
on the whims of foreign rings for a necessary commodity.
The Gippslanrl (Vic.) coal-miners, who are once
more on strike, have wisely adopted the coupon sv*>teni
to eke out their shallow funds. But their system differs
from the one which was elaborated at Broken Hill .luring
the great strike there. The silver-miners established
their own stores and shops and did every hand's-nirn of
labor themselves, even to the patching of the youngsters’
shoes. Every man had to make himself available for four
hours a day ; some voluntarily worked more. Only those
who were not suitable for any work in any store were put
on the picket-lines. In this wav nearlv every penny
subscribed reached the men in the form of desirable
goods bought in large<|uantities and handle. I without cost •
only Bung, who is usually a great barracker for Labor at
strike times, had a very cold time. As for the general
storekeepers, they were satisfied not to have to make
bad debts But in Gip)>siaiid the plan adopted
is to. let the ordinary tradespeople do the dis-
tributing, the strike committee issuing coupons payable
in goods and redeemable at the miners' office—a good
enough plan as far as it goes, but nothing like the money-
saver that the other was.

The small tricks of spiritualistic seances: One
medium’s forte was to tell the confiding circle which sur-
rounded him the names of different articles that would
appear in forthcoming English magazines and illustrated
papers. It was given out that he was controlled by some
literary spook in the old land. His statements were
always verified when the publications were on sale in
Sydney later Secret of it was that If you get (as
daily newspapers for thieving purposes do) English papers
by letter mail, you beat the newsagents' delivery by a
fortnight or so. A Melh. medium, the other dav, staled
in dramatic tones at one of the seances, “My father is
dying, there is no hope for him." Then (after a pause):
“ God help me, he is dead ! ” Me started svbbing, and
the meeting broke up in confusion. Mail news later con-
firmed the medium’s “vision." But the fact, probably,
was that he had got a cable.

“Theta” writes concerning the Victorian oil
and scent industries :—“ A few years ago T came across a
man in Vic. western district who had given up a profit-
able trade to embark on the eucalyptus oil and scent
business. He set up a still in the Victoria valley, near
the Grampians ; and ran the whole affair, down to the
selling of the product, with the aid of a bov. He used to
put in a few weeks, camped in a lent, distilling the oil.
Then he bottled it, and started on a pilgrimage amongst
the storekeepers and chemists in his district. Yet,
although his expenses were very small, he couldn’t make
a living. Everywhere he went he bumped against cheap
and nasty turpentine-diluted oils—whose proprietors ap-
parently have their distilling plants in the Fitzroy
gardens; and, although the grocers knew that the
old man’s oil was pure, they couldn’t give him
a profitable price. As a side iine the ancient grew
lavenderand tuberose for scent, but this spec, was even
more disastrous. He regarded the potentialities of the
eucalyptus as boundless ; and he had, he declared,
extracted oil from dozens of varieties, with different
results. From one kind he obtained an oil that was
magical in its curative effect on open sores. In two days
it cured an obstinate broken and ulcerated chilblain of
my own." [Most of the eucalyptus-oil retailed is shame-
lessly adulterated, and Tub Bulletin hopes that the
Health Boards will aee to the matter.—Ed. B. I

The Bulletin’s recent remarks about
“ tied ” houses in Maoriland were hardly strong enough.
Here is one publican’s experience : Goes to a brewer for
a house ; signs for rent, £250, say ; for goodwill he pays,
say, £7OO, part of which is advanced at 8 per cent, by the
brewer, the prospective publican not having enough
cash. Also, all liquor to be got from said brewer.
Result, if the publican goes straight, he gets behind with
rent, the brewer closes on capital, and exit publican.
Also, in M.L.. the house is endorsed for breach of law, not
the publican, and for three bad marks in three years the
house loses its license—hence the brewer stipulates that
the publican shall forfeit £l5O if the ticense is endorsed.

A man who had just begun to exploit a long-
neglected but very payable line of advertising—lightning-

Melbourne. The trouble was the olistruction to street

overcoming it.

A recent "smart capture” by the Melbourne
detectives. A young man tried to pass a bogus cheque
on a Bourke-st. draper ; the fraud being discovered in
time, he cleared out. The 'tecs got the cheque, however,
and made a tour of inspection of the city hotels, and in
the visitors' tiook of one discovered an exact copy of the
signature on the forged cheque. The guest responsible
for the entry being in the bath at that moment, the Law
patiently wailed till he came out, when lie was promptly
nabbed. On the station lieing reached, the 'tecs found
that they’d arrested, not the forger, but the man
name and signature had been forged ! But what else
would sensible men have expected ?

Re millionaire Carnegie's well Bup|x>rted re-
mark that “ home commerce is the true king." Isn’t it
aUmt time that the Victorian Protectionists, as well as
Australian Freetraders, saw the |>oint of this statement ?
Victoria's broken-down condition is due, in a measure, to
the extraordinary preference shown during the last ten
yea re, or more, for an outside trade. j>etty pro-
ducer has, under the guidance of Melbourne newspapers,
kept his eye firmly fixed u|>on a market 12,000 miles
away. He has certainly hit the mark with his butler
and his meat, but in a dozen other directions he has
scored the heaviest kind of failure. The tobacco iiulust ry
is a case in point. The Victorian grower has centred
practicallv the whole of his energies it|»on “ o|>eoing up
an English market," despite the fact that Cockneydoin
has the best of the world to choose from, and was
naturally prejudiced from the first by the inferiority of
Australian leaf, arising from inexperience in growing and
curing. There should have been a big chance of an Aus-
tralian market for Australian tobacco, and local growers
should at least have first “ tried it on the dog ,F in the
person of the local cigarette-fiend. Same way with the
raspberry and apricot pulp business. The whole of the
raspberry-growers in the Upper Yarra districts set out
with the notion that they should attack the London
market, and their helpless indifference to the prospect of
developing a big Australian demand has ruined them
just as absolutely as the tohaeco-men have been ruined.
Every school-child should know that England is an ex-
cellent place for raspberries-grows them almost wild
and should be able most years to meet the whole of her
demand, which is naturally limited by the fact that
nobody wants to keep on eating the same kind of jam All
the year round. Even when Victorian growers did
happen to strike the market, it was partly because of the
novelty and partly because of the fact that the English
supply was a trifle short for a particular reason. When
the supply caught up again there was no longer any use
for the Vic. product—yet the grower hadn’t gump-
tion enough to try and seize on to a market
in North Australia, or to turn some of his
raspberries Into raspberry vinegar or syrnp to replace

The Dunlop Co.’s success with their new tyre
has brought along the inevitable imitators—against
which all cyclists should steer clear. The new Dunlop
tyre-cover is made under a patent process that absolutely
prevents any other tyre-makers from copying or pirating.
Furthermore, the Dunlop vulcanised cover is manufac-
tured by machinery, which cost thousands of pounds to
make and erect; consequently imitators have a hard task
in store to produce any tyre approaching the Dunlop
Oo.’s latest production.*
Severe Trials Weathered Through.
Sailors at sea have many a severe trial to
weather through. But they stick to their ship,
laugh at the storms and manfully pull her through.
Then the weary and trying times of the past are
looked backed upon light-heartedly. Many a
man’s existence can be likened to a ship struggling
against adversity upon the ocean of life. Trials
come, but he who manfully puts his shoulder to
the wheel and determines to push through them,
succeeds where others fail. Mr. William Huston,
of Ashburton, New Zealand, was well nigh ship-
wrecked upon the ocean of life. Before he became
utterly wretched, however, he miraculously saved
himself. “For some years,” he say, “I had a
sluggish liver, which ultimately ended in a long
and painful illness. On the top of this I had
influenza, which further deranged my liver and
brought on a complication of the kidneys. I
underwent treatment by two doctors, but their
medicine and advice were alike useless. Worn to
but a mere shadow of my former self, I was night
and day the victim of the many ailments that
ceaselessly troubled me. In this state I should
have remained had it not been for Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, which did for me what doctors
could not effect. The past is but a mere dark
shadow through which I have passed, the present
is full of happiness. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are the best and mildest medicine I have
ever taken, and through their agency I have been
permanently and completely cured.” Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood purifier, and
a positive cure for biliousness, indigestion,
constipation, headaches, sallow complexion, liver
and kidney troubles, piles, pimples and blotohes,
and for female ailments. Put up in amber bottles
and the full name blown thereon.*

Athata colt Athanie (owned and trained as was Melbourne
Cup.winner Merriwee) for Australian Cup. He made a
hard fight with Falkirk in the run home of Bond Cup at
V.A.T.C. meet Saturday, and only went under by a head,
in face of fact that he moved a bit sore. Athanie won
Trial Handicap at V.R.C. Spring meet, and was only
beaten a head by Omrah for Heatherlie Handicap ; but,
going wrong in the underpins subsequently, he dropped
out of the minds of most who had been watching him
with a vigw to further speculation. All the leg trouble
has disappeared, and as the nag is a cool, satisfied sort of
animal, it’s any odds on his covering a distance well, and
the feather he has to carry in Australian Cup should fit
him beautifully.

Punters who have been indulging in early picks
for the Newmarket were discouraged to find Pendant
getting away with the Oakleigh Plate last Saturday. The
daughter of Far Niente and Necklet is missing from the
Newmarket list, like Orry, who had previously won the
Cooyong Welter (7 furlongs) in brilliant style. In one or
other of these races many of the Newmarket fancies made
a poor show. Homestead, Corinthia, Athainoora, Chan-
tress, Famous, Drawbridge, Maharani, Cloohette, Insect,
Mairp, and Heloise finished nowhere. Some of them
were not “wanted,” perhaps, but seeing that the Oak-
leigh Plate was worth £6OO to the winner, it is safe to
assume that triers were in the majority.
• • • •
The Futurity Stakes, on Saturday, will show
what sort of pretensions Sir Leonard, Drawbridge, Chant-
ress. Famous and Suzanne have for the Handicap a week
later. Last year Sir Foote romped away with this rich
Erize before winning the Newmarket from Aurons, who
ad also won the Futurity Stakes in 1901. This queer
sort of w.f.a. race promises to be once again a guide to
the Newmarket result. Present scribe reckons that one
or two can beat Wakeful on Saturday, and if
Suzanne (7.1) is nearly as fast as her friends state, she
should win. Suzanne will have about a stone the best of
it with Famous and Drawbridge on their Newmarket
weights.

Pendant’s success in V.A.T.C. Oakleigh Plate,
Saturday, was generally anticipated until a day or two
before, when it became known she had been off her feed

Brennan advised friends that the mare had only a fair
chance and invested half the amounts most friends
entrusted him with. Pendant won easily as it happened,
but ’tis more than likely had second nag (Dulcimer’s)
rider been in better fix a closer finish would have
resulted. Time was ljsec slower than F.J.A.’s for Oak-
leigh Purse two weeks before (and F.J.A. ran fourth in
Plate) but conditions were not nearly as favorable.
Twenty-three of the continent’s best sprinters lined up.
Though 2 to 1 was taken about the winner days
previously, rumors as to her condition had such an effect
that she opened up 6 to 1 against on the course.

Acrasia, undergoing a special Australian Cup
preparation, was considered a “moral” for Warwick
Handicap, Saturday last, but, though starting at even
money, she only just managed to win, and no more, with
Street Arab pushing her hard. Four furlongs from home
she had to be literally forced along. After that writer
won’t have Acrasia as an Australian Cup winner: she
didn’t shape a likely one at all. Last Caulfield Cup
might have been hers—previous track-work and subse-
quent racing indicated that—but those in charge while
owner (Oxenham) was in England scratched the nag
because Mo. wouldn’t lay the price they wanted. It’ll
probably be a long time before she gets into such fix
again.

Unless Abundance, who was “all to pieces” a
few weeks ago, continues to improve wonderfully up to
the day, this scribe will expect The Victory to win the
Champion Race, beating Wakeful. A great 3-year-old—
and Abundance, fit and well, is undoubtedly great—can
win th- three mile event, for the scale of weights favors
the youngsters. But the recent sick appearance of the
double Derby hero impressed good judges with the idea
that he couldn’t possibly be made quite right by the first
week in March. Nothing else in the £lOOO event is a
performer of the same class as Wakeful and The Victory.
And the horse is going to beat the mare if he gets through
his preparation satisfactorily.

Recognised hard and fast law governing turf
betting is that each party to a wager must, when it is
made, have a reasonable chance of winning, otherwise
it doesn't hold good. Starters for Stewards Mile, at
Warwick Farm, Saturday, included much-fancied and
well-backed Cutaway who hadn’t the remotest hope of
getting the money if he won through being prepared hy
an unregistered trainer. As a matter of faci, the nomi-
nation was invalid and should never have been accepted,
Had hackers kicked against paying it would have been
interesting to watch how Sydney Tatt.’s would have
dealt with the case—especially as that body’s particular
care—Mo, would have had his satchel so materially
lightened by the only ruling thatcould honestly be given.

Rev. Devenisb, a Congregationalist parson at
Bendigo, has discovered some new and conclusive reasons
why the tote spells ruin to the morals of this country.
The shepherd aforesaid was recently in Tasmania, and
there he met a business man, “ the head of a very large
firm,” who told him that “ if one of his employees, male
or female, were known to take a chance in Tattersall’s
sweep, he or she would at once he regarded with sus-
picion and soon be discharged.” This is tantamount to
saying that the employees are not known to buy sweep
tickets (they wisely keep their investments dark), and
are therefore not suspected or discharged ; which proves
that the parson’s authority re the sinfulness of the tote is
profoundly ignorant of its effect upon his employees.
Also, Rev. Devenish “ contrasted the reception accorded
to Mr. Joe Thompson and the recent home-coming of Dr.
Morrison.” Here the shepherd is equally convincing.
Ernest Morrison, being a man of the world, is probably a
supporter of the tote, whereas Joe Thompson and the
pals who banquetted him, and paid for the sickening
laudations of Joe in the Melbourne dailies, are all of them
allied with Rev. D. in opposing the totalisator.

Luck ! A N.S.W. South Coast hotelkeeper has
an ostler who recently dreamt about a horse-race, in
which he saw a horse named Inkstand win easily. He
had never before heard the animal’s name, but was so
impressed with the dream that he asked the “boss” if
he knew of any such. Inquiry showed that there was a
moke of that name entered for Sydney Anniversary Han-
dicap, and the boss, thinking he would risk something on
the chance, sent a fiver to Sydney, which was invested
for him at 4to 1. Afterwards, having to visit town on
business, he attended the meeting, and, getting further
information re Inkstand, backed him on the course for a
tenner at 7to 1. The horse won, and he was thus £9O
richer for his employee’s dream. Yet the man who backs
dreams will lose 999 times in 1000.

“H.”: Re statement (8., 14/2/’O3) that one
Davis was the first king of the English betting ring. That
is wrong. ' There were kings before Agamemnon -and
before Davis, too. The first king of the English ring l
have heard of was one William Ogden, known as the
“ Newmarket Oracle ”as far back as 1797. When Ogden
went under, Cloves and Robinson took up the running,
but it was reserved for the famous Crockford to be
generally accepted and crowned “ king of the ring.”
Naturally enougn, the bookies in those early days were
grossly illiterate (the nobles were not much better), and
many of them were “ cross-men,” so far as signing their
names was concerned. They got there all the same, how-
ever, for, as one North Country penciller put the case :
“Aw beant mooch of a seolard, hut Aw reckon Aw know
how to soom (sum).” Some of their feats of mental arith-
metic would run close to Inaudi’s, although on one of
them being sounded as regards his arithnietip, he im-
patiently exclaimed : “Aw doan’t want any o’ yer dom
rethmatick at all. What Aw want is to lay six to tower
on ta feeuld !"

Owner, Mr. J. N. M'Arthur, of Bond Cup-
winner Falkirk probably scooped in some of his losses, as
that big- disappointment was well backed, and went out
at eights. He cost 650 gs. as a two-year-old, and was
raced through two seasons without success. With 7.7
(in lusive of 101 b. penalty), Falkirk had a chance In Aus-
tralian Cup, but it was only in accord with the fitness of
things that he should break down after Saturday’s
gruelling struggle, and he will probably never race again.
Lately defunct stallion, Splendor, destroyed at
Cobbora through a kick from a mare, was foaled 23 years
ago and brought to M.L. by Mr. G. G. Stead, who subse-
quently sold the nag to Mr. F. Reynolds, of Tocal
(N.S.W.), at which place Splendor sired winners of close
on £50,000. Splendor was by Speculum from the Stock-

“ E.E.” writes: The decision in Queensland of
Judge Mansfield that “two-up” or “ headen ’em ” con-
tains an element of skill which lifts it out of the category
of games of chance, and makes it legal to play the game,
is somewhat ridiculous, but, when considered from an
equity standpoint, it is a good subject for debate. The
Queensland pulpit is in an outburst of fury over this
legalising of the Australian youth’s favorite game. This
is_ how “ two-up ” is played : One of the players takes the
kip—a small piece of wood—and, placing on it two
pennies, holds it in his hand while the crowd make side-
wagers on the toss. “ Heads a dollar ; heads ten bob ;
tails a deaner ; heads a brown is then shouted among
the crowd, and after the bets have been made the kip-
holder spins the coins in the air. If on reaching the
ground two heads or two tails are uppermost money
changes hands, but if it is one head and one tail, or
the coins, in falling, roll against a player’s boot
another toss is given. There is no skill in “ headen
’em,” but sometimes there is cheating. I contend
that “two-up” is an illegal game which ought to
be suppressed if only on account of the appalling amount
of blasphemy it causes on vacant allotments. Looking at
it from an equity point of view, however, “ two-up ” is a
legal game if horseracing is, and if it is legal to keep race-
courses and stock exchanges it is legal to keep “ two-up ”
schools.

Stevenson, the champion billiardist, leaves
London in March for an Australian tour under the
management of Alcock and Co. With no travelling pro-
fessor to lead him in his work, Stevenson will have to
pick up local talent as he goes along, and presumably he
hopes to make some straight-out matches with Weiss'and
others. He starts the ball rolling at Fremantle on May
16, gets to Melbourne in June, then to Sydney and the
North, taking India on his way back to London. Hard to
say whether the public that railed up to see Roberts per-
form in his best days will discover an attraction in Steven-
son. The coming visitor, though undoubtedly superior
to little Dawson, lacks the notoriety of old man Roberts
Roberts carried his advt. in his name, but the mere
announcement of “ H. W. Stevenson ” on a poster would
have no meaning for the average man in the street.
Billiard champions don’t understand the art of booming
their show. One never sees a personal par. about Steven-
son. The biograph has not been called to his aid. Why
can't a champion cue-pusher get himself biographed in a
series of showy strokes—screw-backs, &c. ?

Pace followers Robl and Dickentman are of
opinion that Ferg. Smith, a diminutive handicap rider
who weighs but nine stone, is the best of a very mediocre
lot of pace trailers in Victoria, and there is a probability
that they will engage him for a Continental tour next
month. Still, there’s not much likelihood of the cracks
engaging an Australian who might possibly wipe the
floor with them at their own game.

Melbourne cyclists appear to have a tinge of
humanity in their marrow-bones, and have held a race
meeting to raise an Injured Cyclists’ Fund. The idea is a
new one in Australia—but something urgently needed

accidents in scratch races and handicaps, but now that
the idea of being a “ champion ” pace-follower behind a
flying motor is rampant, a greater fund than the proceeds
of one meeting will be needed. It should be a general
fund built up by all racing cyclists—a fund to which all
bikLts should contribute with an idea of getting “laid
out,” and receiving some return for being well-nigh killed

Certainly Major Taylor rides under engagement.
But how do they pile it on ! Next Saturdav, at St
Kilda, Victoria, he will race Don Walker for £lOO over
three mile heats, then the following Saturday he will be
pitted against the winner of a heat of the nine best men
in Australia for £lOO over the same distances. Taylor
leaves soon for the East—but while he is in Australia he
will have to earn very solidly the few pounds he receives
There is a great idea in Melbourne that Walker can beat
Taylor over a mile, hence these matches.

Five miles motor-paced struggle at Sydney
Cricket Ground, Saturday night, wherein Robl from
scratch conceded a quarter-lap to Dickentmann and a full
lap to M Donald, was a hair-raising thing. Robl picked
Dickentmann up early, and then streaked after M'Donald
who streaked, too. Both were at top tension. Not till
a mile from the finish was M'Donald caught. Then it was
all out with each. Robl tried often to move away but
the best he could do was to keep level. For three-fourths
of the last lap it looked either man’s race, then M'Donald
seemed a winner, but the high-strung nature of the finish
P™ v ’ ed much for him-he lost his pace. Prior to this,
M Donald and Dickentmann, starting together, had a cut
at each other, but the terrific gait set was too much for
M Donald, who went under by a quarter of a lap. Time
(4.59 2-5) was exceedingly fast. Ten miles motor-paced
race was hot all the way ; Robl gave Dickentmann half a
lap, M Donald 2 j laps, and Goodson 3 laps. Latter was
never caught, and finished close on a lap to the good

Motor-paced cycling, Monday night, attracted
only a moderate crowd despite morning dailies’ booming.
Public have been surfeited with the bike and its conneS-
tious, and will probably stay away to a man directly if
the thing isn t given a spell for a while. M'Donald (24
laps), Goodson (2 laps), Dickentmann (4 lap), and Robl
(scratch) were at it over five miles, and' M'Donald won
easily in the speedy time of 8.24—0n1y llsec. outside the
continent’s test, created hv Robl, Saturday last. Goodson
was off color compared with his showing on Saturday.
Robl’s attack on Australasian mile record was a revela-
tion in pace following’; he fairly shot over the ground
and trailed the pacer as if part and parcel of it. Watch
showed 1.28 2-6—6 4-6 better than the figures attacked.
Frenchman Contenent holds the world’s best (1.16),
brought into existence last year. During the five miles
struggle Robl got the time for that trip down to 7.40 1-5,
thus beating that made by himself Saturday last by 32 4-6.

“J.”: Sydney Cricket Ground is run by a gang of
grab-alls. At the beginning of the season, when holders
of tickets wish “ to go back ” on their renewal, they are
kept in touch by advts. re the great chance it affords of
seeing visiting athletic champions very cheaply. Last
season the English cricketers were here, besides all the
inter-State and big local competitions. This year saw
three inter-State cricket fixtures and the Major Taylor
boom, and the Robl-Dickentman motor-paced cyclists. In
March there will be more cycling and Lord Hawke’s
cricket team. The trustees haven’t got the least sym-
pathy with the athletic bodies who cater for the public
by finding the money to pay such visitors, and, besides
holding at least a third of the accommodation for their
dead-heads, the trustees have the unspeakable gall to
demand a share of the “ bob-stand ” receipts.

Defeat of South Australian premier swimmer.
Moon, by New South Welshman, George Read, in 100yds.
championship of Wheat State, Monday night, demon-
strates unmistakably that Moon hasn’t got the speed he
was locally credited with. There are, perhaps, half-a-
dozen in Sydney who could account for Read over the
hundred in seconds faster time than that (1.8) clocked for
the race referred to. Read shines from a quarter mile up
and should have little trouble in settling Moon over the
longer journeys.
Re the “ trudgeon,” or crawl, stroke.
All savage races swim with the over-arm stroke, which is
something very like the trudgeon, and, although the
latter has been practically used only during recent years,
it has always been known by Australian swimmers.
Fifteen years ago the boys at St. Hilda (Vic.) would throw
in a few strokes with the trudgeon at the end of a close
race, if they were finishing strongly, but it was regarded
as too severe to use for more than 10 to 20yds. The
swimmers of the day forgot that use is everything, and
the man who is exhausted by running 440yds. one day
can run 5 miles after two months’ practice. The side-
stroke they themselves used had, in its day, been con-
demned by the breast-stroke conservatives for the same
reason.

“ best ” (2.37 1-6) belonged to Fred Lane, who also owns
the world’s figures (2.28 2-5), which Cavili might have got
closer to but for the narrowness of the basin and conse-
quently badly troubled water. Eight laps and a further
20yds. were necessary to complete the distance.

“Bias”: Sydney dailies t’other day told of a
protest by one bowler that another’s bowls weren’t up to
required standard and the protest was dismissed because
the bowls objected to bore the stamp evidencing that
they had passed prescribed test which, though accepted
in Australia and M.L., is not the right thing at all. Rules
exact that only “3” bias bowls shall be used. An
ordinary billiard table denuded of top, bottom and sides
is the testing medium, and bowl to be tested is run out of
a groove in right hand corner of top end and to survive
the test it must clear a mark in centre of bottom end of
the table. Obviously the heaviest bowls (which are
usually the bigger biassed) must attain most
momentum and, as a bowl doesn’t begin to
“draw’’.properly till the pace is off it a bit, the
weigh ter spheres would fail to pass where lighter and
straighter ones might do the trick. T’other day a
bowler, with exceptionally big drawing bowls (3£ bias),
tried them on the testing table and they failed to qualify
for the standard stamp, while others which didn’t “take”
near as much “ green ” were branded correct. A big
Sydney firm imported a lot of bowls lately, and before
they left England had them tested in accord with the
Scottish Association laws and stamped, but the Aus-
tralian test found one pair tried verv much wanting
which was almost certainly wrong, for they do the thin"
properly “ down under.” Writer sees bowls frequently
that he’d bet anything are not “threes,” and which act
more like “ straights, and still they bear the necessary
hall-mark.

Petersham pulled up the shortage and finished holding a
surplus of seven. Same day, Victorian pennant fell to

From Great Britain and Ireland comes the com-
plaint that sporting dogs (not so much the coursing dogs)
have been deteriorating for the last 20 years and more.
Pointers and setters nowadays are degenerate scions of a
noble race both in appearance and in working ability.
Dog shows are blamed for this falling off in the quality of
the animals, also the modern methods of dog-training are
said to be less rigorous than of old, but the training of a
pup can hardly affect its looks. Probably luxurious
feeding, kennelling and ciddling explain the situation.
Fashionable sporting canines are growing dull and languid
like the lisping johnnies they serve. Even the onetime
matchless courage and tenacity of the bulldog are
under suspicion.

coursing at the latter place, must not know the swell
section of the Moses under penalty of the latter’s com-
plete annihilation. Could autocratic ruling be carried
further? By what right does the A.J.C. interfere with

Victorian law is fast •nough when it is a
eas« of sentencing a prisoner to three months
extra for breathing too loud in presence of the
gaoler contrary to the regulations, but in dealing
with a well-to-do farmer it is slower than a
chloroformed tortoise. Six months ago Victoria
was scandalised to hear of the death of an
insane woman who had been almost continuously
imprisoned for five or six years, if not longer, in a
miserable leaky shed with an earthen floor. Now
the statutes have just got on the track of the
farmer who owned the premises, on a charge of
illegally running a sort of amateur lunatic asylum.
Certainly the statutes have had plenty of time to
think over the matter.
dream superstition gets a leg-up over
the matter of .Tones, accused of helpinglo butcher
.Policeman Long at Auburn, Sydney. The accused
was lying low under a clean shave and a different
name, in a house somewhere among the dog-
haunted and kerosene-tin-strewn bve-vvays of
Sydney, either by reason of the Long affair or on
account of some other episode in his stormy
career; and meanwhile a woman in the house
alleged that she dreamt he was Jones, and that
tall men dressed in blue came for him. So much
was she impressed that she addressed him as
Mr. .Jones.” Now either the dream business is
looking up, or. the woman had suspicions and
invented the vision as an excuse for calling the
clean-shaved visitor Jones to see if he would give
himself away.

It’s the quality, provided the price is right, which makes anything popular. GUINEA GOLD CIGARETTES are made of the highest grade mild Virginia Leaf imported
into this country. We use it, there being no tobacco better than the best. Each Cigarette is made with the utmost care and cleanliness. The price is 3d. per packet of 10

Frog-farming is now a big thing in
Ontario. One farm produced 5000 pounds (2£
tons) of dressed frogs’ legs in one year. Shipped
to the States and sold at fancy prices ! No
industry is despised by the cute Canuck and the
brainy Yankee. If Massachusetts raised bandi-
coots and iguanas, tinned bandicoot would be a
world-wide delicacy and iguana-oil would be, by
now, a specific used from Cape Cod to Kamts-
chatka.
•* Burglar Bill ” tells “ some gaol facts” •
With 80 per cent, of “First-time” prisoners there has
been no premeditation whatsoever. I have <piestioned
them by the score (it is in gaol that you hear the truth
about a case) and have found that the temptation came
like a whirlwind, and 10 minutes later the criminal stood
aghast at his own folly.
Ninety-nine per cent, of “bush" prisoners in for
abnormal offences are mad. It is in gaol you see the
result of the accursed monotony of the hush. The bush
contributes nearly all the revolting cases.
Warders do not know the prisoners. It becomes second-
nature after a few months’ confinement to throw dust in
the eyes of the prison official on every possible occasion.
The warders pride themselves on their cleverness when
they find out some small tricks that are known
to the first-time prisoner as soon as his name is dry in the
books. Have seen men stripped and searched by warders
looking for weed and finding none ; then the prisoner had
a smoke after they went out of his cell. It is only lately
that the prison authorities took the small piece of soap
out of the cells and made a prisoner break his bread into
small pieces at “ lock-up ” search. What “ plants ” that
bread concealed !
Sometimes the warder scores. No. 29, undergoing
separate treatment, went to church and succeeded in
getting half a “ long tailor ” of weed from a mate outside.
W’hen he came back Warder Lunn, in charge of the
“ wing,” shifted 29’s mate who was in the next cell to 29,
and then rapped on the wall asking in gaol telegraphy if he
had any luck ; 29 told him what he had got and the warder
said, “ book out, old Lunn will get it.” “No fear,”
knocked 29, and told where he had it. When Warder
Bobby Lunn went in and asked him for that tobacco,
29 couldn't speak for disgust.

A yarn current in New Caledonia says
that “Bully Hayes,” in the zenith of his power,
had oontrol of a small isle in the Pacific inhabited
solely by women. Upon this island he would
land, as a punishment, any insubordinate follower.
Within 24 hours of his landing, the victim was
invariably torn limb from limb by the jealous
ladies.
A curious story comes all the way from
Russia. A widow demanded that her late
husband’s partner should repay £2500 that the
deceased had lent him. He assured her that he
repaid it during her husband’s lifetime and took
oath to that effect, with his right hand uplifted,
before a statue of the Virgin—whereupon his
right arm became paralysed and has remained so
ever since. Possibly he strained it by lifting it
up too high, but the general impression is that he
had better pay the £2500.
S. A. Treasurer Butler is promising himself
a surplus now. Comparatively speaking it has
been a boom-time for the lower-north cocky, who
has had fair crops and good prices. It is years
since so many of him have been able to buy a new
buggy—the one act of dissipation he permits him-
self, even in the best of seasons, barring, perhaps,
the trip to town at cow-show time.

EVERY CHILD bom into the world with an inherited

humours of the skin, scalp, and blood, becomes an object
of the most tender solicitude, not only because of its suf-

such afflicted children to acquaint themselves with the

Warm batha with Cuticura Soap, to cleanse the skin of crusts and scales
and soften the thickened cuticle, gentle anointings with Cuticura Oint-

heal, to be followed in the severer cases by mild doses of Cuticura Kesol-

desired for the alleviation of the suffering of skin-tortured infants and

George Reid was much questioned in
Westralia concerning the wherealroutsof his “dry
dog,” but he would never allow that he owned tho
beast. At Boulder city he exploded thus :
The do? isn’t mine. He’s a miserable little cur that
nobody would run away from. He’s Tug Bcllbti.n’s dog.
My dog isn’t like that. He weighs half a ton.
And so that’s why he didn’t throw it in the water
—for the same reason as he didn’t throw the pro-
tected sugar industry into the water : it weighed

Intemperate men are the curse of whisky,

spirit, to set up an unholy thirst. It distributes
happiness and strength to the thinking faculties
wherever it flows. Good old D.C.L. 1 Long may

Alleged friends of Miss Dolly Castles state that J. 0.
Williamson offered her a permanent engagement at£lsoo
a year for a leading role in the comic-opera co. This seems
hardly likely, for while the young lady has a voice of
considerable promise, it has yet to be proved that she
would make a good comic-opera artist. Yarn goes that
Miss Castles refused the alleged offer, preferring to train
for the concert platform.
Australia has almost, but not quite, forgotten Mrs.
Molyneux, the tall, stately, handsome actress who used
to appear with the B. and B. and other companies some
eight or ten years ago. The cabled news that she has
obtained a divorce in England from her medical husband
now recalls her to public memory. Quite a number of
theatrical people are similarly recalled.
Elton’s return to Australia, generally alluded to as “a
short visit,” was a visit that lasted more than 18 months.
A heart-breaking time for the old favorite. He came as
the “star” of the “Morocco Bound” co., which didn't
enjoy a prosperous career. After the co. had disbanded,
Elton took engagements where he could get them. An
attempt to boom him in light comedy at the Bijou, then
under the nominal management of Phil Stuart, was a
failure, and, when the unhappy Dacres came along, poor
old Billy was added to their co. as a minor attraction.
After the Dacres* failure, Elton knocked around until
Williamson engaged him for the “ Djin-Djin” panto., and
that kept him going awhile. But, before he left the
country for the second time, he was glad to accept a short
engagement from Westmacott, who was then running
Melb. Royal. Westmacott staged “The Silver King,"
with Scot Inglis as Denver, and in the ancient Jaikes
character Elton made his farewell appearances.
An irreverent London paper, in slating Wilson Barrett’s
amended production of “ The Christian King," selects for
praise the two Australian girls in the co. “The play was
acted as it deserves. Ranting raged all round, and in
that atmosphere of wild exaggeration the sweet and
tender simplicity of Miss Edyth Latimer as Elswitha and
the buoyant gaiety of Miss Alice Crawford as a bonny
Saxon maid came like a breath of common sense in a maze
of perplexing bathos. Mr. Wilson Barrett was himself.
He shouted lustily. His costumes and resplendent
helmets were sublime. He was every inch a king—the
king of his own play.” This voices what has ever been
the opinion of intelligent people everywhere concerning
Barrett and his cheapest claptrap dramas.
Rather odd that “ Billy ’’ Pauli, the baritone, should
have met his death at St. Louis (America) a day or two
after the first Australian revival of “ The Geisha," in
which he had made his debut as a comic opera singer.
Pauli, in “The Geisha,” was an amusing novice on
account of his intensely self-satisfitd manner and bearing.
His costume throughout the piece was a naval uniform,
and he set so much value on his appearance that he made
a [joint of wearing at least two shirts during the evening.
He changed one spotless white shirt for another, in the
full belief that he was giving the girls a fresh treat.
Australia’s beauteous baritones have seemingly got into
away of “falling out” which is more dangerous than
Brassey’s custom of “ falling off.” Brownlow fell 30 feet
or so from an open doorway at the Sandringham (Melb.)
Coffee Palace. And now poor William Pauli has died of a
drop from a sixth-storey window at a ’Murkan hotel.
“X.”: The "Theatrical Decadence ’* outcry by news-
paper letter-writers would be more impressive if it did
not include a special shriek against the "excision of the
transformation scene ” from recent pantomimes. Surely
there was nothing in a conventional transformation
scene that deserved to he held artistically sacred. The
gaudy panoramic extravagance seems to have dropped
out of date as naturally as the old gold and silver valen-
tines, which were paper transformation scenes in minia-
ture.
The amusing Dan Barry continues to pull the local leg
of his up-country constituents. Dan, when last heard
of, had won the heart of the Darli.no Downs Gazette re-
porter, who concluded a paean of praise for the show by
“ thanking the genial Dan himself for the gra'-eful com-
pliments he nightly pays us, as a community, in his
before-the-curtain orations, while the music of the com-
pany's pianoforte is all that could be desired.”
It must have been a serious disappointment to Tas-
mania after one public-spirited Launceston man had
guaranteed £TOOO for a Melba concert, that the singer
was prevented by illness from keeping her engagement.
The lady had a very hostile reception at Launceston
railway-station in consequence of the announcement, but
probably could not help getting ill, and was herself, no
doubt, a bit disappointed at not getting the £lOOO.
Lilian Wheeler, late of Australia, is playing a Boer girl
in the curtain-raiser at Wyndham’s Theatre.
Herbert Flemming and Wheeler, formerly of Austra'ia.
are rival boss managers in S Africa. Cape Argus recei tly
published an interview with Wheeler. He rolls more
hundreds of thousands of pounds about his tongue than
any other manager on record.
The Bulletin's London correspondent:—“Harry At-
kinson has broken his leg. Slipped getting off a ’bus in
the recent raw, greasy weather, an 1, as he is now no
longer a drooping-moustached, fragile, clever boy, but
15 stone of clean-shaven, square-jawed, bullet-headed
prize-fighterdom—to look at—snap went the tibia, ulnar,
fibular, femur, or one of them, and now he has months of
salarylessness before him. He was at the time doing
splendidly—four shows, including the palatial Hippo'-
drome, nightly.”
London Sketch publishes a remarkably tricky photo, of
Wilson Barrett and Lillah M'Carthy iii “The Christian
King.” The fair Lillah, with her large eyes staring wildly
as usual, looks almost her full age, whereas Barrett is not
a day more than 23 in the picture. His face is innocent
of lines, the aggressive Roman nose has been somewhat
pared down, the solid figure is that of a stummickless
young man of, say, sft. Tin., Barrett standing a little in
advance of Lillah who-e head is thrown back to diminish
her height. The real Miss M'Carthy must be fully 2lin.
taller than old man Barrett, but, owing to his elevated
boots and the arrangement of the picture, he appears to
have an inch the best of it. The same number of the
Sketch gives a charming portrait of Alice Crawford in the
gown of an early Saxon milkmaid, or something.
Charles Cartwright, of the loud, authoritative voice, has
presumed to appear as a fascinating hero in “ The Mouse,”
an English adaptation of a somewhat old French comedy.
Evidently the reason for producing “The Mouse” lay in
its title. Other London managers had scored with
“Mice and Men” and “The Country Mouse,” so Cart-
wright tried an experimental matinee of “ The Mouse.”
Theatrical enterprise is ever imitative. One successful
play bearing a distinctive brand breeds many aspirants
for its popularity. If a comedy called “The Elephant”
were to “knock” London next week there would be a
whole family of elephantic plays within a few months—
“ The Baby Elephant,” “The Elephant’s Trunk,” “The
Performing Elephant,” and so forth.
London D.T. must have deputed a very rabid patriot to
write its notice of the Drury Lane panto. Listen to the
critic ! “ Praise be to Christmas, to Merry England, and
to Drury Lane for the glorious pantomime. How could
London live without it'? It incarnates some of the best
qualities of our national humor, its originality, its
whimsical fancy, and its cleanliness.” Originality, qiaint-
ness, and purity are only some of the best characteristics
of Hinglish humor 1 There are others which are likewise
of the best. In fact, all the qualities of English humor,
from the latest “comic” song to the orthodox Anglo-
Latin pun in Punch, are absolutely The Best. Everything
in the garden’s 10-o-vely. *
There was an unrehearsed scene just before the Corrick
family of entertainers opened at St. Arnaud (Vic.) that
would have crowded the house had it been advertised
beforehand. Corrick ptre, having hired the Town Hall,
shifted the council’s piano from the floor to the stage.
This the Mayor objected to, lest it might fall through the
platform, or something, and ordered Corrick to remove
it. Corrick said he had hired the instrument with the
hall, and proposed to put it where it would suit him best.
The Mayor, the town-clerk, and the road-inspector
started to carry the piano by storm, but were met and
defeated by the Corrick family. Then old man Corrick
armed himself with a bucket of water and dared them
to renew hostilities Just then theeouncil’s gardener, who
had been cleaning out the l>ed of the lake, happened along.
He was covered with mud from head to foot, and didn’t
care tuppence for anybody ; moreover, a shower-bath
would do him more good than harm ; so he went for the
challenger “regardless.’’ also was willing, so
there was a pleasing but muddy “ go in ” for the space of
five minutes. The gardener lost much of his mud in the
“ unpleasantness,” most of it cleaving to Corrick, though
.the Mayor got a few ounces, and a bucket fell pn the
town-clerk. Finally the matter was settled by hie Wor-
ship refunding the rqoney paid for the use of the piano,
and Corrick hiring another machine—which wa» a lame
and impotent ending, after tta waste of to much mud
and energy.
Now that the early operas of Verdi are ridiculed by
advanced critics for their melodious airs and antique con-
struction, it is amusing to read what George Augustus
Sala, the subsequent “ Prince oi Journalists’' had to say
about those same works when they were young. In his
forgotten book of cockney sketches, “Twice Round the
Clock,” the conservative Sala, son of an Italian father and
a theatrical mother, bewailed the decadence of musical
taste. “There is lately come to town, at least within
these latter years, an Italian gentleman by the name of
Verdi, to whose brassy screeds and tinkling cymbalics, it
is expected that all habituis of the opera must listen, to
the utter exclusion and oblivion of the old musical
worthies who delighted the world with their immortal
works before Signor Verdi was born. 1 have brought you
to Her Majesty’s Theatre, and this is, unfortunately,
a Verdi night. You may listen to him, but 1 won’t. . . .
I will shut luy eyes and muse upon the bygone glories
of the opera.” Where, O where are the immortal operas
which delighted the world before Verdi was born ? Mozart
gets a hearing occasionally, but his renowned “ Don
Giovanni ” appears to be quite dead. And what price
Verdi and his contemporary, Wagner, in Anno Domini
2003 ? The man who snorts at the recognised “ great ”
music of the moment is not more foolish than the up-to-
date critic who scorns the snorter's ignorant preference
for older stuff.
A Neglected Plague.
One or two cases of bubonic plague at an Austra-
lian seaport excite alarm throughout the whole
continent, and cause a frenzied effort to clean up
and avoid the wrath to come. It is well that
there should be a scare about some disease, for a
clean-up is an admirable thing, whatever its cause.
But why do not other plagues—typhoid and con-
sumption, for examples—excite a little reasonable
alarm ? Together they regularly cause more deaths
each w-eek than the bubonic plague ever caused
in a year in Australia; and, whilst bubonic
plague is one of those diseases which may be
imported from abroad, and rage in a city through
no fault of its people, the two other complaints
are mainly of local production, and the result of
local mal-administration. The typhoid season in
Australia has begun theatrically this year with
epidemics at Coonamble (N.S.W.) and Leongatha
(Vic.), and so excited some little attention. At
Coonamble there have been over 100 cases in a fort-
night. Every outbreak of typhoid is an indict-
ment of the community on a charge of filthy
habits—of digging its well where it will col-
lect house-drainage, of allowing dead animals
to fester in its water-supply, or of treating its
cow in an uncleanly way. The blame for
typhoid cannot be passed on to a foreign rat; it
must be sheeted home to the locality of the out-
break, and prove there the existence of some dis-
gusting habit or another. Its general prevalence
in Australia is, therefore, the most grievous re-
proach jiossible to the community. Consump-
tion’s common occurrence is another reproach,
but “the white plague’’is. to some extent, still
a disease of mystery and requires a high degree
of scientific care to secure its extinction. Typhoid,
however, is a disease whicli can be avoided by
avoiding earthy habits, A simple matter seem-
ingly, but not within the power of many Aus-
tralians. When Sydney Water and Sewerage Board
thought that it would be necessary, a few months
ago, to reinforce the metropolitan water supply
by pumping from the Nepean River at Penrith, it
had to employ a boatman to shift dead animals
out of the water. Hundreds perha|« thousands,
of people dwelling on or near the banks of the
Nepean used its water for drinking, but hardly
one of them would take the trouble to pull a dead
animal out of the stream. A little of the essence
of long-deceased pig or defunct cow gave a flavor
to water which was, to them, not unpleasant.
Typhoid could be almost suppressed with a good
system of local government, and a vigorous en-
forcement of the Health Act. And it would be,
but for the old familiar difficulty that obtrudes
when any practical work needs doing—that there is
no brass band and glorification and champagne
luncheon in the business, and it’s difficult to
secure political attention for a matter under
such circun.stances. A useless bridge built with
borrowed money can be opened with much bang-
ing of political tom toms, but the typhoid case
that was prevented is an intangible affair which
can’t be made the subject of a banquet or be asso-
ciated with an “elegant silver trowel,” or form
the text for a speech criticising the opponents tif
the Government.

The English “semi-teetotal movement,”
by which the semi-teetotaller pledges himself not
to drink between meals, shows no sign of catch-
ing-on in Australia. Possibly a movement for not
eating between drinks would have better luck.
Just now. by the way, there are a great number
of people in England who have no meals to drink
between, and the movement makes no provision
for them. They don’t seem to be joining—it is in
“ business circles” that the semi-teetotal idea has
caught-on, and business circles can get so many
meals that if they drank considerably at all of
them, they would find the cash-box full of snakes
and would create a scandal by trying to deposit

Talk about the loneliness of the Bush 1 A
wealthy old lady in Edinburgh has just been
found dead in her house, the body having lain
there for over a year before anyone troubled to
make enquiries.
The late Archbishop of Canterbury got
credit for saying a few things that were good in
the un-Kerristian sense of the word. As, for
instance, when student Field Flowers Goe, the
subsequent tiresome Bishop of Melbourne, had
faiied in an easy exam. : —“Field, you are
ploughed ; Flowers, you are plucked ; Goe, yon
can go,” Also, it is stated that the Archbishop
made a bitterly apt remark to a grovelling
shepherd who suggested—“ I fear your Grace
finds the weather very trying.” The old fellow,
blessed with a salary of .£10,000 a }’ear to comfort
him, said—“No worse for me than for anybody
else.” A very small concession to the truth, but
better than nothing at all. As a member of the
House of Peers, the Archbishop was probably
thinking about bis noble brethren, the dukes and
earls, when he said, “anybody else.” He
couldn’t have been thinking of the ragged, food-
less multitude who never go to church.
CHRONIC
CONSTIPATION
can be cured by
Ghanjberlain’s
Stonjac/j aqd
Xiver Tablets
Price, 176 JUST WHAT YOU NEED.
Chronic Constipation results from a lack of
moisture in the residual matter of the food.
It becomes so dry and hard that the muscular
coating of the intestines is unable to expel
it. Two of Chamberlain’s Stomach and
Liver Tablets should be taken to begin
with and after that one each day. When
taken just after supper they will insure an
operation of the bowels on the following
morning. In most cases this lack of moisture
in the faecal matter is caused by an insuffi-
ciency of water being taken into the system
and cannot be cured unless more water is
taken with the food or drink. If taken
with the food, unless in shape of fruits
(apples and bananas), it is apt to interfere
with the processes of digestion; but if a regu-
lar habit is established of taking a full glass
of water as soon as you get up in the morning,
about two hours after each meal, and just be-
fore going to bed, it will in most cases correct
the disorder—not at once, but in time.
Chamberlain’s Stomach and Liver Tab-
lets are not intended for habitual use but
to give temporary relief until a cure can be
effected by taking more water into the system
and establishing a regular habit by having
the bowels move every morning immediately
after breakfast whether there is an inclination
0 r not.
NOTE.—If not able to obtain Chamber-
lain’s stomach and Liver Tablets locally,
a package will be sent, post paid, upon
receipt of 1/6. or six packets for 8/-, by

“ What time is it ? ” The question asked so
often, apathetically, idly, now held a trenchant
meaning. The sick man spoke eagerly.
“ Five—only five 1 Are you sure , nurse ?”
“Certain.” The girl pushed the watch-stand
round. Was it years or only weeks since she had
taken it from the waistcoat-pocket, when the
patient had been brought in? One of the few
white stones in her hard-working life had been a
holiday week in the country. In that week she
had learned to love this man, whom Fate had
now given her for ever. He would never need
anyone else. As day succeeded day she had
learned to love her charge with the passion of
despair. She put away, as she would an evil
thing, the knowledge that he was dying. One
evening when, after the pitiless wakefulness of
endless pain-stricken nights, he had fallen into a
sleep, the mask had fallen, and she had cried as
only self-contained women do cry occasionally
over the wasted lovelessness of their empty lives.
He had awakened suddenly. As she handed him
the medicine glass, he pushed it aside, peering at
her curiously.
“ You’ve been crying ! My God, girl, don’t cry
over me —I’ve not had such a bad time. I’ve had
everything I ever wanted. Nearly everything
that is. Nurse, how long—how much longer can
I last—a week ? ”
The girl did not answer. As she straightened
the bedclothes, lie caught her hand.
“ Answer me I—a week ? ”
«» ”
“Longer?”
She shook her head miserably.
Then for a while he had lam very still.
“ Nurse! ”
“Yes?”
“Come here. T want to ask you to do some-
thing for me.” The something proved to be the
bitterest cup a man can otfer to the woman who
loves him. . . , , , .
As she listened to hint, in the darkened room,
she felt as if some one had taken her by the
“Such a dear little soul, nurse. Pretty!—
awfully—and as innocent as a child. Why she
wouldn’t let me kiss her, the little lieaiity ! Said
she liked me, y’ know, but—nothing of that sort.
But I think she would come if you went. Tell
her I’m pretty bad, but don’t frighten her. . . .”
• • • •
She had gone, The dear little soul had listened
sympathetically. Of course, she would come and
see him. She patted her fringe daintily as she
spoke, and thought of what she would wear-
something quiet—grey or black ! And, of course,
she would take some flowers.
And now the dying man lay counting the
minutes. A subdued “ ting ”in the distance and
the nurse rose quietly. -
“ She is coming ! Don’t go—she wouldn t stay
with me alone ! ” gasped the sick man.
As the little figure appeared at the door, the
nurse went to meet her. With a warning hand
on her arm she checked the unmistakable start of
horror the girl gave as her eyes fell on the man
on the bed.
“Let me go!” she whispered, “he’s dying!
The atmosphere of the sick room revolted her.
“ You had no right to send for me,” with a painful
attempt at dignity. . . _ „ ~
“ Why doesn’t she come in ? Dolly, won t you
speak to me ? ” .
“Go to him—go to him at once !
As the girl dragged herself to the bedside the
nurse set her teeth.
“ Dolly—my little one 1 So you’ve come ! How
cold your hand is ? Yes—vou f ve got the bracelet

me so prettily. You wore a white frock with
violets—l remember. You’ve got violets now-

little saint. Dollv, come here—closer. Don’t be
frightened ! Don’t be frightened, darling—l’m

It isn’t much to ask.” . , , ,
The girl recoiled from the feverish, death-
stricken eyes, the wasted arms.
“ I can’t—l can’t. Take me away 1
“ Dolly—just—once. Quick—the medicine 1
“Leave the room!’’said the elder woman, as
she half-carried her to the door. Then she hurried
back to her patient.
“Dolly—kiss me!”
Kneeling by the bed, she hung over him in
./ust—once, dear. Only—once! ” Again the
piteous request. ~ , .
Then, stooping down, the nurse kissed him.
When she lifted her head the eyes of the dead man
stared into the Beyond.

BEING THE LETTERS OF AN AUSTRALIAN IN
EXILE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dec. 23rd.—Started out for Dover by the dear
and nasty line through Ashford. The train
arrived at Dover three hours late, so that I lost
the night-boat to Calais. Slept in a great echoing
hotel, and found that its baths were all for show
—there was no water-supply.' Found the Calais
boat full of frost-bitten men and chilblained
women, some of them enveloped in furs. One
man, furred from his cap to his boots, looked big
and stalwart till I saw him in the saloon below
changing his clothes. With furs he was the
member of the Russian Embassy at Paris—the
typical Russian prince of the novelette; uncovered
to his travelling tweeds he was a Justice Shallow
—Falstaff’s Genius of Famine.
What a change from the slow Dover railway to
that fine road—the Northern of France l The
express trains make the run from Paris to the sea,
185 miles—in 3 hours 5 minutes—by almost the
same track that D’Artagnan was made to ride by
Dumas. From Paris to Amiens, 81 miles, the
speed is over 63 miles an hour, from Amiens to
Calais, 103£ miles, the time is 104 min. The
trains are about 170 tons each and are the fastest
in the world for such a distance. Yet there is no
perceptible vibration—you can write with ease
running on this road at over 60 miles an hour.
This is only one of tho fast lines of France. Pre-
sent running times will be reduced greatly when
the new track-troughs—enabling the engines to
water while running—are completed. The troughs
occupy the centre of the track, and the locomo-
tives take in water by means of scoops.. Ex-
perience of other of the French lines since this
first visit gives me the greater admiration of them.
The French locomotives are world-beaters for
quick starting and grade climbing. Australia,
despite her prejudices, might, with good results,
when buying, get particulars of the De Glehn
locomotives. They have enormous boiler and
heating surface, weigh about 60 tons, and carry a
steam pressure up to 2401 b. The English loco-
motive is “prettier” than the French—it has
more brasswork and paint and general brightness,
and the stack is higher. The French locomotive
looks more like an engine of war than of trans-
port, and its appearance is made more grim
by the front of the boiler being razored off for
wind-cutting. The chimney is low down, crouched
behind the wind-cutter; the whole machine is
painted a dead-black; and the sight, head-on, of
one of these beaked locomotives rfmning at full
speed is altogether terrible.
At Paris, there was a clean, clear city to rest
the eye on after the soreness of the London fog.
I dined at the Cafe of the Black Cat, and inquired
vainly for garlic. Was told by the waiter, who
appeared shocked at the inquiry, that they did
not keep garlic. The world is growing weaker—
at least, its breath is.
December 23. —Reached Modane —on the Italian
side of Mt. Cem.-s —at 10 this morning. Snow
everywhere —covering the railway track and the
great mountain behind it; taller than, and as
steep as, Byjerkerno. Mt. Cenis is very fine—the
sort of unnecessary hill which calls for an un-
necessary tourist to climb it for no especial reason.
Around Modane there are a few farms, each
with a fine barn and a tumbledown shed for a
dwelling-house. The cockatoo farmer is the same
in the Alps as on the Hawkesbury River. ,
In Genoa I found the beginning for me of
Italian art and the worst refreshment-room on
earth, not even excepting in Westralia. But the
newness of it all stopped any criticism of the
dinner. Even that vile refreshment-room was
frescoed and painted till it became a little hall of
wonder, and opposite me there was a bright-eved,
blue-haired Italian woman, whose teeth flashed
with the whiteness of milk—one of Shakespeare’s
Italians she was.
From Genoa to south of Spezzia the rail runs
in and out of the cliffs by the Mediterranean. It
is curiously like Tasmania. There is a bay like
Penguin and another like Emu Bay. The air has
been very mild since we left the snow, and I fountl
myself half believing that I was on the road from
Ulverstone to Emu Bay, looking out for the red
lantern on Table Cape.
At Pisa my bedroom was coned and domed and
frescoed, and the use of marble, to eyes accustomed
to the cemented brick of England, was prodigal,
on the threshold and on the window lintels —the
windows that opened on to Juliet’s balcony with
a big white moon shining on it, and below in the
garden the red gold of ripe oranges against leaves
of magnolia green. I sat on that balcony and
smoked for an hour, and looked at the oranges and
the oleanders, thanking my luck that had sent me
from the fog of the antipodes of Australia into an
imitation of my own land.
Dec. 24.—Christmas Eve, and the air is like
Sydney air in winter. Have been gloating over a
graven brass spring at the back of the bath-room
door—very common here, but all these mani-
festations of art in articles of utility are new to me
and I gloat accordingly. On the staircase, instead
of a second rail, a crimson rope of silk and
worsted, held by rings in mouths of bronze. In
the dining-room a bewildering scheme of decora-
tion, pigmies with women’s breasts, Medusa
heads and parrots’ wings, in the liveliest of colors,
panels of roses in the spring of the roof; griffins,
hermaphrodites, and roses again. All this in a
modern hotel in a fourth-rate town !
Back to the railway station I went, and tried for
a seat in many carriages—finding each one with
its complement of lady tourists accompanied by
the lady tourist’s unspeakable dog. Finally found
a place in a compartment where a bearded Italian,
with one moustache pointing to his left ear and
the other moustache making a bee-line for his
right eye, was engaged in eating raw bacon. In
an opposite corner a young man with whiskers of
the first crop—fine as thistle-down—paddled the
hands of the girl next him. At Collesalvetti, the
changing-station for Leghorn, the Cannibal left
us, and the man with the thistle-down whiskers
grew bolder and paddled both the girl’s hands.
She was a nice girl, too.
There were more Horatian groves, and Ana-
creontic rocks, and all the outlook was wide and
deep and high and majestic for space, all with
the inspiration of a big country like Australia,
which is a name to be said with trumpets.
We stopped at a station with five words for its
name, and the young man alighted. But in a
moment he had climbed the step again, and the
girl put her head out of the window, and met him
more than half-way. She asked him for a kiss as
plainly as could be without the use of words—but
he was nervous, and paddled her hands only,
when he should have clasped her till he broke
every bone in her stays.
The Australian is the new Argonaut. I have
met him everywhere. As I write there is on my
desk a letter from an Australian now in charge of
a hospital in British East Africa, and in that
letter he says that at a place a hundred miles from
him two Australian prospectors have found pay-
able reefs, and are staggering on to success despi;
the obstruction of the local officials of the Britisn
(lOrerarnßnt. And this day at San Vincenzo an
Australian politician met me, and we drove away
from the sea to the big range of limestone which
the train had coasted for half-a-dozen miles.
The road left the open lands and ran along oak
scrub for a mile and a half, and the hills opened
out to us. Northwards a grass-covered mountain
and marble cropping on its summit—this is Monte
Rombolo ; behind it a limestone range known as
Monte Calvi ; south, a great hill bare at the
summit and covered with oak-scrub at its base,
and easterly another oak-scrubbed range. We
met men in twos aftd threes and dozens —all
polite, all laden with umbrellas big enough for the
dressing-tent of a circus ; all glad with parcels of
perk. For this had been St. Bartholomew’s Day
of Swine at Lanzi, and the mine management
had presented each man with a dinner. They
stepped out with all the pride of new possession,
bowing and doffing gravely as they passed the
carriage—the livid pigmeat, stained with blood,
carried carefully against the men's waistcoats.
Before the beginning of mining here —that is
the last beginning, for the Etruscans worked
before the time of Romulus, and the Romans after
them— the average wage of a man in this commune
was two francs a week—about Is. Bd. ; and now it
is 15 francs a week and over, and there is food for
the mouths of the children every day There is
not a bird here ; they have been discouraged from
breeding by being eaten Before the mine was
reopened the life of the local rabbit was of short
duration and full of misery. So terrible was the
poverty that many believe the tale that butterflies
were pursued for soup-meat. The death-rate of
children was double that of Australia, for there
was no food —only yellow sunlight and the
sapphire of the Tyrrhenian Sea. It pleased me
greatly to find that the prospector of this show
was a man of much Australian experience.
And there were two ladies Australian-born, and a
Scotch general manager of Maoriland experience,
and his Wife, who knew kiwis and kauri. It was
all very strange and pleasant to meet these people,
who were of the country most dear to me, and we
sat and talked—myself uproariously as usual, for
I have not yet learned that half-lazy imperturba-
bility which is called repose in the old world.
The next day we went to see the mine—an
enormous, comparatively low-grade copper pro-
position ; and nearly as big a lode of mixed lead
and blende.
Sheltered by the shoulder of Monte Rombolo,
and having the position of an eagle on its crag, is
the ruin of a castle of the 13th century. It is
built of marble, on a precipitous marble rock—
from it can be seen the road by the sea that runs
from Pisa through the Maremma to Rome. Down
the Maremma road came the rich traffic of
western Europe—noble religious enthusiasts and
poor pilgrims, hurrying to kiss the bronze feet on
the marble statue of Christ in the church on the
Appian Way, and all of them carrying treasure to
the Pope. The. pilgrims could not see that castle
of marble perched like an eagle on its c-rag ; but
the robbers in the eyrie saw the pilgrims, and
descended on them by the road I travelled yester-
day, and made the treasure of the pilgrims un
necessary to the pilgrims by killing them.
Naturally, the Papal revenues suffered, and the
Pope sent troops to take the castle. That was in
the 13th century, and the besieged held out for 14
-months before the 12 .walls of the castle were
taken. The troops of the Vatican pecked at the
place as birds at a tough acorn.
They held out wonderfully well, did those
robbers. Their water-tank is still to be seen;
about 70,000 gallons capacity it was, and I suppose
that, true to the customs of the time, they used it
only for drinking. They had a chapel, too, and I
suppose priests who prayed God to guard the
righteous, the righteous being the employers of
the priests at the time of praying.
As 1 stood on that old ruin that had seen the
long agony of the Papal siege, I felt l had been in
the fight. I saw the walls go one by 7 one until the
twelve had fallen, and the water gave out, and
our men were dying quickly ; we buried our
friends decently in the church and threw the
slave-carrion over the battlements. After that
we killed our women because there was food only
for fighting men, and we could neither bear to see
them starve nor think of them as spoil to the
besiegers. As we slew them in the tower they
shrieked at their last look at the Tyrrhenian sea.
On that crag we had been very happy, bringing
them jewels and gold ornaments and precious
stuffs that they might walk all gay—gifts we had
gotten from the dead pilgrims. Then the priest
and I were left, and the priest wailed to buy his
life with surrender ; aud I killed him and fled to
the last stand in the tower, and there was killed
myself with the lucky stab of a short sword in
the throat.
Given interest and imagination, many lives
before this life seem very real. On one of the
copper lodes here a new tunnel has cut into many
Roman shafts, sunk in a spiral to below the
oxidised ore. The slaves carried the ore in
baskets on their heads up the spiral stairs. I can
see myself carrying ore so. The overseer bent to
me from the spiral above, and beat me on the
head with a whip of gut loaded with tongues of
copper. One day I killed the overseer, and fled
through the oak-scrub and the gullies of cyclamens
to the fields of lupin and the ripening grapes ;
and so to the sea. There I found a boat, and
would have put safely from shore ; but seeing a
woman bathing—her white body argented in the
moonlight—l waited. In the dawn she came
again, and bathed, and I seized her and carried
her to the boat. Her screams brought men and
archers, and though I pushed the boat fast through
the shallows they caught on. One I killed, and
one drew blood from me, and at that she said that
I must kill her; for she had screamed before she
knew that she loved me. We were but twenty
feet from floating water when one man, her kins-
man, hearing her words, stabbed her; and as 1
turned to grip him another stabbed me in the
side. Wherefore I died, because I had not a
minute left to win to sea. These are two of the
Things I Think I Did.
Strange is the fascination of this old mine of
classic times. Etruscan tools of annealed copper
have they found, and Etruscan pottery whose
meanest utensil is full of grace—and tear-bottles
buried with the dead, who are now as utterly
disappeared as are the tears. The smallest thing
that man makes lasts longer than its make .
Also, most pathetic of all, in the old workings
were found rabbit-bones of recent date. Brought
there evidently by some starving peasant who had
killed his rabbit and come underground to cook
it—eating with his loins girded, and trembling in
the dark.
We crossed the old Roman spoil-heaps and sat
in the house of the shift-boss at the Temporino
workings. For lunch sweet olives with anchovies
from the Isle of the Gorgons wrapped around
them, sardines senza spini from San Vincenze,
and local fowls. For drink some whisky an!
niuch barolo—which is a wine of Piedmont, of
about the strength of our clarets, and approxi-
mating to good Burgundy. And I did drink—for
this is one of the Things I Know I Do.
There was the lead-show under Monte Calvi to
see next day. The ore has been proved at two
Rvels below an enormous open cut made by the
Romans. The first wonder is, as at the copper
topes at the other end of the field, the good
standing nature of the work so that not a stick of
timber has been used in the stopes ; the second—
the work the Etruscans did with copper tools and
the Romans with iron—and without explosives in
either case. Of course, time was no consideration,
and the work was done by slaves, who were paid
with a little pulse and oil.
Returning, I looked into the Via Cavour and
saw _ there four women returning from wood-
cutting. They were still young ; but they looked
like middle-aged women who had starved and
worked since childhood. There was no light in
their eyes, nor color in their faces. They carried
axes —not American, but with the blade long and
narrow—-the axes of the Septembrists of the First
Revolution. They strode along like wearied men ;
there was no softness in them ; murderers’ axes
were on their shoulders and navvies’ boots on
their feet ; they were w< men to kill sweet Love.
We drove to Cam pi glia station that night to
take the road to Rome ; descending swiftly
through cypresses and Horatian groves to the
Maremma, and passing on the way women re-
turning from their work at the oil-crushing, and
waggon-loads of new, wafer-thin, wine-flasks ready
in their protecting thatch, and going nobly to
their duty.

THE KIDNEYS:
WHERE THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO.
As the kidneys have more work to
do than any organ of the body, it is
important to know where they are,
what they are, and what they do.
The picture shows where the kid-
neys are—in the small of the back.
That is why the back aches when
there is kidney trouble.
What are the kidneys?—They are
owo bean-shaped organs, made up of
thousands of small cells and fine mem-
branes. They are the most delicate
organs of the body. When the kid-
neys are weak, the least cold or chill
affects their action.
What the kidneys do.—They filter
the blood—every drop of our blood
goes to the kidneys to be filtered and
purified. When they are well the
kidneys take out nearly five hundred
grains of impure matter every twenty-
four hours.
When the kidneys are sick every
organ goes wrong, because sick kid-
neys cannot filter the blood properly.
Poisons and impurities are left in,
and these cause headaches, backaches,
limb aches, fluttering of the heart,
dropsy, and rheumatism. There will
be a too great or too little flow of the
urine, with gravel or sediment; you
will feel always tired, done up, ner-
vous, and restless.
Doan’s backache Kidney Pills are
the great kidney and bladder cure.
They go to the root of the whole
trouble, and greatly relieve, heal, and
regulate the kidneys. They freshen
you up, because they rid the body of
<«i0Nfyt
its accumulated impurities through the kidneys.
To one with kidney or bladder trouble, whose kidneys and whole system
are clogged with impurities, there can be no relief equal to that afforded
by this great kidney medicine.
Doan's Backache Kidney pills
But do not be satisfied with our word for this}
Read what our fellow townspeople say :
Mr. John Moroney, Ham and Beef Shop, 228 Elizabeth-street, this
city, states: “About eighteen months ago I began to get a feeling in
the small of my back as if I had a growth there, or as if some foreign
substance had lodged inside. It did not show outwardly. This troubled
me more than you would suppose. I could not lay in my bed with com-
fort for it. I saw Mr. Grieve’s statement in the papers about Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and one day I asked him the facts of the case, and he
advised me to use that medicine. I’ve not got much to say beyond mention-
ing that the pills cured me. They have removed the unpleasant sensation
altogether. I’ve not felt the slightest sign of it since I used Doan’s Pills. It
is twelve months ago since I was fixed up, and I’m not afraid of the trouble
returning now. I must advise the use of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills when-
ever pain in the back is felt.”
If every cold or chill affects the back and kidneys; if spirits, beer, or tea
excite the kidneys, or if you have any of the symptoms given above, Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills will relieve and cure you. They do not act on the
bowels, but only on the kidneys and bladder, and can, therefore, be taken
whenever and as often as necessary, without interfering with your daily
work. It dissolves the gravel and uric acid, and carries them and all other
poisons out through the kidneys, giving the patient prompt and lasting relief.
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
are for sale by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box (six boxes,
15s. 3d.), or will be posted, on receipt of price, by Foster-McClellan Co., 76
Pitt-street, Sydney.
BUT BE SURE THEY ARE DOAN’S.
Serious Chances
Ark Taken in Neglecting a Simple Case
op Piles-.
Any person takes serious chances in ne-
glecting an attack of piles. This ailment has a
tendency to become chronic, and there is also,
a further tendency to ulceration and forming
of fistula, which we know are most difficult to
cure.
The safest remedy for any form of piles,
whether itching, or protruding, is Doan’s
Ointment. In using it there is no detention
from daily occupation, and the many cures,
made by it have made it famous in every
corner of the world. Any chemist will tell
you that it enjoys a greater demand, and more
enthusiastic popularity than any other pile
remedy ever placed on the market.
Mr. Joseph Holland, 22 Cleveland-street,,
City, states: —“The advertisement that is;
published from time to time in Sydney papers,
to the effect that Doan’s Ointment cured me;
of itching piles, is quite true. Before 1 used-
Doau’s Ointment I thought I would never get
a remedy to do me any good. I had them for
seven years, and they caused me intense pain
and a most tt«;ing irritation. It is two years
ago since I made the statement, and if Doan’s
Ointment wasn’t a real good thing I would
have had some return of the trouble —instead
I am as free of itching piles as when I made
the statement. Doan's Ointment took all the
venom out of the trouble these couple of years.
It is a marvellous Ointment. Anybody may
rely on it giving absolute ease.”
It cannot be repeated too often that Doan’s
Ointment will cure itching piles. IT WILL
CURE THEM A BSOLTTTELY. But do not
take the manufacturer’s word for this, ask
Mr. Holland. He knows, for it cured him,
and ho lives here in Sydney. Is not that the
best possible kind of proof? Could there be
better ?
Doau’s Ointment is sold by all chemists and
storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per pot, or will be
posted on receipt of price by Foster- McClellan
Co., 70 Pitt-street, Sydney.
Remember the name—DOAN’S.
The Ballad of John Ibbetson.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Ibbetson, the Atheist (whom Christians now
extol),
Ruled o’er his small, agnostic world, King of the
Pagan Soul,
With all the strength of Bradlaugh, all the grace
of Ingersoll.
He tore to shreds the flimsy faiths that feeble
nations weaved,
He showed the Priest Deceiver sunk down to the
Self-Deceived ;
And all his eager following believed as he be-
lieved.
He held to scorn the Christian myth—a Vampire
from the East,
That sucked the virile Western blood till > an
became a Priest.
He preached the newer Brotherhood from dogma’s
chains released.
«God’s truth ” he weighed in human scales, and
jested with the Plan
That settled, as by dice-box throw, the Bless ng
or the Ban.
He showed how Woman’s Love for God was
secret love of Man.
John Ibbetson lay dying, and through the
shrouded gloom
There came to him no vision dread of aught be-
yond the tomb.
But one there was that saw Hell gape within that
quiet room.
A faith she called the Law of Love brought fancies
black and grim
Into the chamber where she sat from dawn till
day was dim,
Or knelt to plead for him with Christ or plead for
Christ with him.
Ah ! little cared the dying man for Everlasting
Light,
His spirit strong was well content that Hay should
close in Night.
But much he loved his mother dear, and much he
loved the Right.
And worse was he than any god of marble or of
air
If in his pride he turned away from helpless
woman’s prayer,
Or preached against the Christian s Hell and,
preaching, plunged her there.
For, through the flames her spirit passed as when
she gave him birth,
She suffered all his Hell for him while yet he
breathed on earth !
They told her of his noble deeds—but what was
human worth ?
ohn Ibbetson lay dying. His creed of brother-
hood
Was bright before his fading eyes, to suffer, to do
good,
To bear the shame unmerited ; to die, misunder-
stood,
Though with his own his name should be a memory
forlorn,
And Christians speak the open praise that hides
the secret scorn,
And never Judgment Day for him; beyond the
Dark, no Morn.
John Ibbetson lay silent, the Book his hands
between;
He heard the summoned priest declare God’s
wrath on what had been.
And, feigning that he saw the Light, died with
the Light unseen.
The legends of the Christian world have told of
tortures borne
By martyrs in the secret cell, and heroes battle-
worn,
But never greater one than he, who died, his
Faith forsworn.
CONSTANCE CLYDE.
“Without Encumbrance.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Not much of a life for a woman,” said one of
the Californian irrigationists, as we rode down the
Murray below Swan Hill. The woman was baking
bread in a bit of a bark skillion back of the dwell-
ing tent, and her baby was squalling in a gin-
case ; t’other was down in the sand amongst tame
“ gohanuas ” and ants. The air was hot as a blast
from a glass-blowing house, the country looked
hungry as the ocean beach, and garbage lay about
and rotted. The woman’s husband was sinking a
tank, she was cooking for the party. It was not
much of a life, however considered.
“Ever see that sort of thing in the States?”
“ No, sir; an American woman was never asked
to put up with that sort of life. That’s Aus-
tralian.”
Another day we came to a woman in a hut by a
water-hole in a blind creek, twenty miles from
anybody. “ Without encumbrance ” so far. She
had married a boundary rider and was at home —
God help her.
“ I don’t encourage it,” said the station owner,
“ but if a good man takes to a girl and she’s fool
enough to take him on, what’s to be done?”
“ Why not bring ’em inside and put up a
cottage”
“ I want him where he is ! ”
“ What’s the end of it generally ?”
“ If they have kids they clear out into the town-
ship and live somehow. I don’t take to the
married-couple business. A married couple with-
out encumbrance can always find a place. Of
course there is bad - business about that tragedy
at times. I’ve told you t don’t encourage it.”
“ Can’t, you get.pieuty.ui married couples from
town ? ” .
“ That’s a lottery. A man could write a good
uok about the making of married couples in town.
I’ve paid fares for some women who went to the
Chinamen’s camp within a week—and meant to,
from the jump. The men were willing enough to
come on, but I didn’t want them. There’s two
sorts, you see, amongst without-encumbrance
women. It’s as that old Begum said, in Kipling’s
book: ‘ There be two sorts of women in the world,
one sort make men thin and the other sort make
’em fat.’ If you get one of the latter, she’ll make
a place comfortable enough, but t’other sort ”
“ Then,” said the American citizen, “ as I figure
things out, there’s no room for women and children
in the Australian bush.”
“Well, amongst the hands they’re a nuisance,
you know.”
“That’s so.”
Next day and we were facing west, brass above
and below, air thick with flies and dust. Said the
citizen : “Say ! shall we strike a patch o’ God’s
country ’tween here and Hell ? ”
“Doubtful! Might, going back, if we make
right up the rivei’.”
Up the river, near Corowa, a month later,
where the good God seems to exercise a little
supervision, we spent a day and a night on a big
station. The boss showed us round, with pride.
Garden, orchard, vineyard, all up to the mark,
and instead of the men’s huts, a decent barrack
building, with a big dining-room and a score of
cubicles; beds made down, and books about.
After dinner the citizen reckoned life about
here was fixed to stay.
The boss hoped so.
“ And this ranch takes hands to work it ? ”
“ We average 30 all the year round.”
“ Then instead of a barrack I’d build a model
township, and I’d call it Kidville.”
The reason duly set forth was : “ I’ve travelled
nearly 2000 miles of this Australian bush, and
haven’t seen kids enough outside towns to keep
one school-mar’m warm.”
The Boss said, “When you get back a bit, the
bush is a poor place for children.”
The lady of the house, “I’m sure we want no
women about the place.”
“ And you’ve got 30 men here to stay,” con-
tinued the citizen.
“Yes, and they ought to be very comfortable.”
The citizen did not persist further. His
thoughts, if plainly expressed, were such as might
have caused confusion of face to the company.
Nor did he pursue the subject when we talked at
large, much later on. But, at parting, next day,
lie said, after a long silence, “ Sheep-tailing makes
hard-working celibates and women without en-
cumbrance.”
“Well!”
“ Outside bosses and their wives, that’s all the
folks you want in this bush of Australia. Good-
bye ! ”
“You don’t think you’ll return ? ”
“ Not before the Second Coming.”
He was a devout man generally, but that was
his way of expressing things.
A good many other people who have looked at
the actualities of bush life —that is, squatting life
—have arrived at opinions not altogether dissimi-
lar from those of that U.S. citizen. Out-back it is
not much of a life for a woman, and those women
who contrive to make a decent life of it deserve
as well of the world that is and is to be, as
any Christian martyrs whatever. But isn’t it
queer that a few men with brains under their
hats, hearts under their waistcoats, and always a
trifle available at the bank, haven’t tried to make
it better ? The woman without encumbrance—
‘ ‘ the sterile growth of sexless root ” —is still
wanted, is advertised for all over a country whose
chief want is people of its own breeding. Is there
anything like a home village on any station from
the Darling Downs to Spencer’s Gulf ? There are
great freehold estates by the score, and dotted
here and there, splendid, luxurious homes. But
the owners are even more neglectful of their
people than the barons of feudal times. They
will not recognise the necessity of men settled, as
their hands are settled, leading natural human
lives. Save within the sacred precincts of the
home station, neither the squatter nor his wife
want any women about the place, although the
place may be a freehold of a quarter-of-a-million
acres.
Absentees are without-encumbrance people
always. Mortgagees in possession also. Children
are an abomination to both clans, for children
needs must have rations, and yield no returns.
The consequence is that on scores of stations in
either of the great pastoral States a child is as
much a rarity as a blackfellow in a settled dis-
trict. And yet people theorise about the
unsatisfactory increase of population even in the
bush of Australia.
We may fall back on the travelling U.S. citizen
and admit that the bush is not much of a place
for either women or children. But that admission
does not include at least 20,000,000 acres held for
pastoral purposes, on which it is the absolute duty
of the proprietors to provide all the requirements
of comfortable domesticity. Over the bulk of that
country no such provision is made. Anything
approaching domesticity is, indeed, distinctly dis-
couraged. Children are repugnant to owners and
managers astoadvancedsociety women. They don’t
work in with the systam. The system holds four-
fifths of the fat lands of those States consecrate to
St. Merino and his worshippers, and to the wife-
without-encumbrance, and it sends such common
creatures as childbearing women and family folk
generally to grub unprofitably on lean and sterile
acres.

From a Bulletin contributor, in India—
Pitiful to read newspaper vaporings anent the “un-
swerving loyalty” of India, and of the “ necessity for
native representation,” as set forth in England, and now
and then in Australia. Last week’s Australian papers
gave Billy Maloney’s rant about the “ unfranchised and
intelligent millions of India; ” and I laughed when the
next post brought a Lahore native paper with four
columns of vituperative sedition, such as John Norton
would fear to print. The ryot in his millions cares not a
fig for Government—English or Russian or Moghael—so
long as he can pay the money-lender and get tobacco.
The town dwellers and most well-to-do natives are
actively “disloyal;’* and, perhaps, from their point
of view, with reason. Thus: the native idea of
justice is diametrically opposed to the European
one. The power of a plutocracy is vividly
recognised, as one might expect in a land where the
entire evidence in a murder-trial may be purchased for
50 rupees, including the corpse. A system which will
give a wealthy Brahmin twelve months with the same
impartiality as it punishes a sweeper, and which treats
in vindictive fashion such purely intellectual pursuits as
forgery and perjury, does not appeal at all to the native
mind. The natives certainly often manage to beat the
system by purchasing multitudinous witnesses—eight
annas is the regular fee fora day’s perjury; and if the
beaten litigant be rich he or his relatives can still take it
out, of the victor in the good old way. The successful
litigant in India not seldom mysteriously tumbles into a
well or otherwise dies suddenly. The native magistrates
and judges appointed of late years are extremely popular ;
since the bigger bribe always gains the case, and the
smaller i 3 returned honorably to the loser.

Mr. Wm. Alien, Polios Constable of North Carlton, Victoria, sends a photo*
graph of his family and says:
“i or many years we bars merer been without Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in the
house. When any of us »r» feeling poorly, just a few doses will make us all
right. My wife says it is a grand medicine for children, especially when they
are growing fast. She dnds it of great benefit, herself, when she gets tired
and worn out from overwork. The same
medicine cured me once of a severe
liver complaint, pain through the kid-
neys, and impure blood.”

Mr. Allen should certainly he proud of his family. And he shows good
judgment in keeping Ayer’s Sarsaparilla always in the house. He knows it
gives bright eyes to the children, makes them have a clear and smooth skin,
brings good color to the cheeks and lips, and gives them the hearty appetite so
necessary to a substantial growth and development.
Don’t make the mistake of experimenting with some other Sarsaparilla.
All other Sarsaparillas are sold because they are said to be like Ayer’s.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
The Greatest Family Medicine the World Has Ever Known
ON
On Our Selection, written by A. H. Davis
(“ Steele Rudd ”) and published by Tiie
Bulletin Co., has earned the title of “the
jolliest book ever printed in Australia.”
There is laughter on every page ; yet the
book remains grimly true to the facts. As
a picture of life on an Australian selection
it has never been surpassed. Since it was
published, little more than two years ago,
upwards of 12,000 copies have been sold at
the comparatively high price of Os.—making
an Australian publishing record. The reason of the sale is not far to seek : the
people who have bought the book know they have got value for their money ;
and they recommend it to others. The price is comparatively high because the book is expensive to
produce. It is well printed, and strongly bound in cloth in good style. There are numerous pictures
by such well-known illustrators as Mahoriy,, Leist, -Lambert, Fischer, Fullwood, and Vincent. From
cover to cover the book is Australian —the product of Aus-
tralian workmen. If it were produced by cheaper labour
in England, it would cost less, and could be sold at a
Cheaper rate. The publishers prefer to employ Australian
labor only. When you buy On Our Selection you pay
a little more than you pay for an English book ; but
you get 100 times the Australian value. “Steele Rudd’s ”
book has gone all over Australia, and wherever it has
gone it has become the treasure of a household, often
the delight of a township. People never leave off
reading it until it is thumbed to rags ; and then they
buy another copy. The characters of “Our Selection”—
“Old Dad,” “Joe,” “Dave,” “Sarah,” and the rest—
have become famous throughout the country ; and their imitation by weaker writers proves the force
of their grip on the public mind. Any bookseller will sell you the book; or if you send a postal
order for 65., with Bd. postage, direct to The Bulletin office, it will be forwarded to any address
by return mail.
