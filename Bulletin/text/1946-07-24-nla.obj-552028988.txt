LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE.
The Royal Palace of Justice.
"pVEN if, as was contended in Victorian times, there were faults
L in its architecture, the exterior of G. E. Street’s masterpiece,
which had a frontage of five hundred feet upon the Strand, must
have compelled admiration. The gateway in the left foreground
was, during the Queen’s reign, the entrance to the Great Hall of
the Royal Palace of Justice, and, through the door in the tower
just beyond, admission was gained to the public galleries in the
Courts. In the middle of the street, at the end of the Strand and
the beginning of Fleet Street, stood Sir Horace Jones’s monument,
surmounted by its once-ridiculed griffin, marking the site of old
Temple Bar. The building in the Italian style beyond the Clock
Tower was the Law Courts branch of the Bank of England, and
the Gothic tower rising between Chancery and Fetter Lanes
belonged to St. Dunstan’s-in-the-West.

THE WAY TO WHITE HOUSE
If there are any thin, bespectacled
children left in the State of Missouri
with no interest in sport and a passion
for quoting from the Bible they should
take heart from This Man Truman
(Harrap). For, according to the joint
authors Frank McNaughton and Walter
Heymeyer, the raw material of statesmen
can be as unpromising stuff as that.
With great zeal, and a scrupulous re-
spect for figures, the authors reel off
some (mildly) astonishing information
about the childhood of the President of
the United States. He never owned a
bicycle, it seems, and at school he never
had a fight. And, “unlike many other
boys in rural Missouri, Harry Truman
never wore overalls or dungarees to
school. His mother always dressed him
well, and insisted that he should wear
a tie and a clean shirt. On Sunday he
put on a neat dark suit with high
1ape15....”
Readers are spared an account of what
the youthful Harry ate for breakfast, or
the brand of toothpaste he preferred,
but his various jobs are given in detail.
First he was a soda-fountain . operator
in a drugstore at three dollars a week:
then, progressively, machine-room boy
on the Kansas City “Star” at seven
dollars a week, timekeeper on a construc-
tion job at 35 dollars a month and
“keep,” bank clerk at 60 dollars a month,
and bookkeeper at 125 dollars a month.
After which he became a sharefarmer
(income unspecified) and learned to
“plough as straight a furrow as could
be found in all Missouri.” Also, accord-
ing to Messrs. McNaughton and Hey-
meyer, he became so proficient in the
art of unmanning swine as to arouse
the admiring comments of neighboring
farmers. Truman served as an artillery
officer in France, and, on demobilisation
in 1919, went into a clothing store in
partnership with a man called Eddie
Jacobson. In 1922 the partners went
broke, and Truman turned his energies
to politics.
Up to this point the book has been
full of the familiar twaddle of fulsome
biographies. But on page 53 the story be-
comes absorbing. The “success” motif
—from drug-store to White House —is
still there, and the judicious lionising,
but there is more meat in the matter.
This is largely due to the fascinating in-
sight one gets into politics, and the re-
freshingly frank comments on “party
machines,” “wardsmen,” “heelers,” and
the" rest. At times it is bewildering to
one not acquainted with the American
system. It is possible that party politics
in Australia are just as dirty as they are
in America, but they can hardly be as
complex. And, dirty or merely grubby,
books aren’t written about them. Or, if
they are, they aren’t published.
Politics in Jackson County, the
chroniclers observe, “were hot.” And
that, to put it mildly, is an understate-
ment, There were two rival camps,
both Democrats, called the “goats” and
the “rabbits.” The deus ex machina of
the goat faction was a colorful person-
ality called Tom Pendergast, a real poli-
tical boss, dispensing largesse and con-
tracts, and an adept at political in-fight-
ing. Truman was backed by Pender-
gast, and was elected as a county Judge.
And here a word of explanation is
needed. In Missouri county Judgeships
are peculiar things. The Judges try no
cases and hear no suits. They let con-
tracts, draw up the budgets, manage
charitable institutions and the like. After
that, despite a few reverses, Truman
never really looked back politically. He
became a Senator, and then Vice-Presi-
dent, and his sponsor, Tom Pendergast,
went to jail.
Concerning Truman’s election to the
Senate, there are a few apocryphal stories.
One is, that in 1934 he asked Pendergast
for his support for the office of collector
of revenue. Pendergast was supposed to
have replied, “You can’t have it, Harry.
I’ve already promised it to another. The
best I can do for you is United States
Senator.” Another embellishment is that
he supported Truman in order to show
Missouri that he could send an office boy
to the United States Senate. The authors
scout these stories, but they were all
trotted out at the Vice-Presidential elec-
tions.
Concerning Truman’s participation in
“machine” politics, no excuses are made.
It is pointed out that there was no alter-
native. Truman’s own views on the sub-
ject are quoted—“A boss-ruled political
machine is a very bad ‘ thing—if the
machine is not on your side.” It hardly
ranks with some of the aphorisms of
past Presidents, but as a sample of hard
political wisdom it has its points.
Truman’s first four years in the Senate
were “plodding years.” He lived quietly,
worked hard, and said very little. His
first chance to catch the limelight was
when he was appointed chairman of a
railway inquiry, but it was a very fleeting
gleam. His big opportunity came in
1940. He had received letters from his
constituency complaining of waste of
public funds in the construction of Fort
Leonard Wood. He personally investi-
gated the camp and saw waste of
material, poor management, and men
loafing and being paid for it. A familiar
story to Australian ears. Unlike many
of our legislators, however, Truman de-
cided to do something about it.
He obtained estimates of costs, con-
tracts, etc., and returned to Washington.
The fruit of his investigation was Senate
Resolution 71, appointing a Military
Affairs Committee, which Truman
headed. With a grant of 15,000 dollars
the committee started to investigate
waste, hustle production, and do every-
thing short of interfering with actual
strategy. The idea was to investigate
immediately : after the 1914-18 war there
had been 116 investigating committees,
which, as the authors observe, “were often
marked by bitter political controversies,
muck-raking investigations, and attacks
on business. All they proved was how
not to run a war.” If the work of the
committee was as valuable as the book
suggests (and judging by America s in-
dustrial effort it must have had some
value) it should have done a lot to justify
Truman’s elevation to the Presidency.
And the story of its work does a good
deal to justify the book, for the Aus-
tralian moral is obvious.
Adam and Eve in Papua.
The opening story in Lewis Lett’s
Savage Tales (F. W. Cheshire Pty., Ltd.)
comes from Papuan mythology and tens
how one Dugari—the Papuan Adam-
made himself a wife on the advice of
Gatumo the south-east wind:
Dugari, Mr. Lett records, did as he was
told; except that he added to the in-
gredients the tongue of a parrot . . .
whence has come much woe to the race
of man in Papua.
This charming (though ungallant) story,
and another pretty and tragic tale con-
cerning the origin of the coconut re-
markable for an amiable conversation in
mid-ocean between a lady and a shark —
are Mr. Lett’s only offerings from myth-
ology ; most Papuan folktales, he says,
are “too crudely fantastic.”
The book as a whole is of a kind too
seldom seen in Australia —a collection of
the sort of stories published by “Black-
wood’s Magazine” ; narratives of adven-
ture among primitive people, told from
the viewpoint of a colonial administrator.
“Edai Siabo,” ranging, if not quite into
mythology, very far back in Papuan
history, is the story of a cripple, who
built the first lakatoi; “Taurama” tells
of tribal warfare and a mass suicide over
a cliff; “Opportunity” portrays a sorcerer
at work, instigating a tribe to murder,
a white investigator and black-
mailing his own people ; “By Proxy” is an
illuminating tragi-comedy concerning a
“fool” who worked too hard for Papuan
taste; “Cockroach” is an appealing love
story in which the villain is a prominent
native land-owner: —
He was a repulsive sight, with his skele-
ton legs and hollow chest. His hands
were clawlike, with long nails encrusted
by the dirt of ages. Loose skin was fes-
tooned in ugly wrinkles about his bandy
knees and flat buttocks. His nose was long,
and Semitic in its contours. His eyes, per-
ennially discharging a yellow fluid that
seemed to attract all the flies in the neigh-
borhood, had a flat, cold appearance like
those of a very dead fish. His mouth was
gross and slack. Lime and betelnut had
blackened his few remaining teeth and
formed a heavy red deposit on his pen-
dulous lower lip.
His voice was high-pitched and strident;
but if softened to an oily whine when, as
was my almost invariable experience of
him, he begged for sugar or tobacco.
But as, through the strange ramifications of
native laws of inheritance, he was an im-
portant landowner, and as such held a
good deal of sway over local affairs, he
could not wisely be ignored.
Mr. Lett, clearly, is no sentimentalist.
And yet he is deeply sympathetic with the
natives, always anxious to put their side
of the case as well as the white man’s
when the races clash. “Treachery,” for
example, is an account of a massacre of
white men in 1895 as told to him by a
native servant whose father took a lead-
ing part in the treacherous attacks ; and
of course from the native viewpoint
“treachery” was simply strategy and the
murder of goldseekers justified by the
immemorial fear of strangers. “Pagan
Faith” is a splendidly balanced story of
the arrest and execution of a native mur-
derer ; “Koiari Law” an impartial
account *of the conflict between white
man’s law and black man’s when a native
kills his wife for adultery ; and “Tara-
vatu,” the concluding story, dealing with
an outbreak of tribal violence in con-
tempt of the Administration, a reassertion
of the necessity for firm government:
“Gummani is strong . . , and . . . can
punish . . . can punish.”
Since writings of this type are primarily
social and documentary in purpose, the
balance and unmistakeable authenticity
of Savage Tales are the book’s greatest
virtues. Mr. Lett, who lived in Papua
from 1910 to 1942, and who has pub-
lished several earlier books about the
country —all good—writes with unques-
tionable authority. But he also writes
well simply as a storyteller; the narra-
tives, sometimes humorous and sometimes
dramatic, never fail to be entertaining and
the natives—whether it is the simple
savage who could see. no harm whatever
in killing off a useless old prospector, or
the houseboy who, rather than risk spoil-
ing the grass of the lawn, walked along
the flower-beds —are always convincingly
portrayed.
“1 will tell you what you must do,” said
Gatumo thoughtfully; “you must take a
leaf of the palm-tree and a petal of the
lily; the head of a snake and the eye of an
octopus; the heart - of a dog and the leg
of an ant. And you must take as much
water as you can carry in your two hands.
When the moon is big and high you must
place them in a hollow rock and cover
them with ferns. And every morning when
the sun awakes, and at every noon, and at
the sleep time of the sun, you must walk
around the rock three times and three. And.
you must say as you walk ‘Comfort ana
beauty and cunning; patience and loyalty
and strength; coolness and music of water;
be one and be my friend.’ ”
Some Recent Poetry.
Since it is not customary these days to
decorate lines of poetry with an airy frill
of apostophe signs indicating the elision
of an “e,” the spellings “pray’rs,” “ev’ry”
and “wand’ring” give a curiously old-
fashioned appearance to J. A. Hender-
son’s The World Is Wide (Georgian
House),
Yet the verses, some of which appeared
in The Bulletin, are essentially
“modern” in the best sense of the term —
meaning “natural”; they are the sincere,
direct and sometimes eloquent utterance
of an Australian airman. Three stanzas
from the most striking of the poems,
“Two Desert Graves,” will indicate both
the faults and the merits: —-
But if these have a soul as people say,
Carrion is all their stony covers keep.
They gave it for the pomp of yesterday.. .
They know alone if they should laugh or weep.
There are too many dots and dashes —
poetry shouldn’t be written in Morse;
there’s the use of “’tis” where “it’s” or
“it is” would be more natural; there’s a
certain awkwardness of expression; and
then in “Or ever hate the thing a yard
away” and “die and quarrel in their dust”
and in the whole of the last stanza there
are both depth of feeling and felicity of
expression; a genuine talent, but inex-
perienced.
Henderson writes a more living poetry
than does Margaret Hinde in Two Sonnet
Sequences (author ; Melbourne), for here
it is not an occasional spelling which
looks antiquated but the whole body of
the work; the metre being mechanical,
the imagery derivative. There is no life
—no smell of seaweed —in this typical
opening of a sonnet; only memories of
other people’s poetry: —
Past waves that turn towards alluring strands
When daylight faints upon a lonely sea
And flights of stars wheel imperceptibly
Along the sky in glittering sarabands,
My swift thoughts fly to rainbow-haunted lands
Where summer plays a ceaseless melody...
Half a dozen lines in which there is a
touch of passion—
The night has all Earth’s shadows in its keep-
ing
But my dark heart has shadows of its own —
show that the author is capable of a more
individual expression, but as a whole the
sonnets are to be read chiefly for their
thought; which is a lucid and often very
interesting exploration of the great
mysteries of life and time.
E. R. Murray’s Song of the Road
(Arthur H. Stockwell, Ltd.) consists of
outback Australian ballads, some of
which have been published in The Bul-
letin’s “Aboriginalities” pages. The
Work is thinnish, but pleasant —
The budgerigars are here again
A glimpse of green in the seeded gram
and, though it is not to be regarded as
“serious” poetry, the genuine life of the
outback is in it. One poem, “The Un-
w'anteds,” too obviously echoes Masefield.
Through the ages—through a new-dead year—
Can ever these two pitied heaps of clay
Give utter death to mortal hope and fear...
Or ever hate the thing a yard away?
No! ’tis well that all forgotten dead
Forget they ever knew the world of lust.
Visioned Hell holds nothing half so dread
As men to die and quarrel in their dust.
Various Verse
Love Song and Willow Crown.
The storm of sunset in a sky of mist,
When clouds are splashed with flame,
And rain-wet hills with orange kissed
Bring back the searing memory of yow
name.
Rich in the russet flame and fire of March
The auburn willows wave,
Across the stream a molten arch.
Though leaf by leaf they flutter to their
grave.
And they were green with yesterday.
„ You broke
One slender, supple bough
For a green crown, and lightly spoke,
“Take this, you morbid rhymer, take it
now,
“And wear it for a crown. I’ll bend it so,
A curve around my sleeve,
You’ll be my poet yet, I know,
And teach my lips to love with songs that
grieve.”

Pillboxes , Now.
No clay-stone village,
As you thought. You saw
What proved, when closer.
Nothing more
Than, sunken in the sand.
Demobilised pillboxes
With their heads shot off,
t With window covers
Made like oven doors,
And
Semi-detached apartments
On ground floors:
Nude women and initials
Scrawled on walls
By nightly-coming larrikins.
Derelict, forsaken,
Empty boxes, pill.
Troops for the use of.
That awaited war
To outburst shrapnel ,
From the sandhill shore,
But only idled,
For no landings came.
Peace: and their heads were
wrecked
By men with crowbars
Looking for a game.
To celebrate,
Now, isolated, standing
In the dunes;
Vacant possession
For the cold, dank smell
And whistled sea-wind tunes.

Anniversary.
How many years ago?
Now the day’s here again —
Almost forgotten, as though
To hatf-deaden the pain.
There should be blackberries.
By the creek banks they grow
As they grew under the trees
How many years ago?
In the first morning light
We gathered them in the rain;
They shone, wet, secret, bright.
Now the day’s here again.
To hold them we plaited fronds
Of bracken, to and fro :
Those wiry green bonds —
Almost forgotten, as though
The time had never been.
Or the blackberries ever lain
Their luminous dark sheen
To half-deaden the pain.

Prisoners.
Yes, We shall conquer space; time, too,
no doubt.
What things, what things, we’ll have to
brag about!
When we for change of scene and climate
yearn,
Trips to the moon for £l5 return.
Cook’s tours to Venus, cheap week-ends
on Mars,
Gay jaunts to Jupiter, even to the stars:
And when we find our own time dull and
tame,
No savory crimes and every day the same,
And long for something more august
and splendid,
Quick journeys to the past are recom-
mended.
To ancient pagan days, Roman or Doric,
Or further back into the prehistoric...
Well, well, perhaps we’re happier in our
cage,
Confined to one poor planet and one age,
Though we can’t change December into
June
Or paint advertisements upon the moon.

Method of cleaning paint brushes ?
A brush which has been used in paste water
paint can be cleansed with water. If used in a
flat paint it can be cleansed with turpentine,
while lacquer thinners will clean the brush if it
has been used in an oil paint. If water paint
is used, allow atmospheric conditions to dry
the brush and suspend it in linseed oil.

A method of cleaning an oil painting?
Lightly wash it over with clean water, not
letting it run on to the back of the canvas, then
rub the surface over with a piece of raw potato;
leave for a short time, then wipe clean' with a
moist cloth. Should the picture be discolored
by old, yellowed varnish and not surface dirt,
take the canvas from the frame and lay flat
on a table, then start rubbing one spot with
a circular motion of the fingers until the varnish
powders and comes off. The whole of the
surface must be done in this way, and a new
coat of picture mastic varnish applied.

(1) Is color blindness hereditary ? (2) Are
only two colors —red and green — concerned?
(1) It may be either acquired or congenital,
, but in the latter case is much more common
in the male than in the female sex. It appears
in families in which the taint of haemophilia
has been handed down. (2) More than two
colors may be concerned. In one form ol the
complaint there is no differentiation of colors
whatever; in another, the spectrum is cut short
at the red end, so that at any distance red ,
is not to be distinguished, and red, orange,
yellow and green appear to be green. In
green blindness, the red. orange, yellow and
green appear as green or red. There are many
theories as to the cause, ranging from the de-
ficiency of grey matter in the brain, in the fibres
connecting these cells to the eye, or in the
structures known as the rods and cones in the
retina. Up to date no remedy has been dis-
covered.
« * * *
Can marriage be contracted without going
through a religious ceremony?
Yes. The essential to a valid marriage in law
is the agreement between the parties. That point
in the marriage cererilbny—civil or religious—
at which in the presence of at least two wit-
nesses the man takes the woman for his wife
and vice versa constitutes legal marriage. The
law requires a preliminary declaration, also a
subsequent registration; but without’ the agree-
ment before two witnesses no marriage is con-
stituted. Either man or woman may withdraw
before such agreement is declared.

Method of preventing decay in a wooden
gate ?
Thin out some white lead in a little boiled
oil and mix in enough red lead to color it a
light pink. Mixture should be just thin enough
for brush work. Apply freely to all wooden
surfaces. When joints are made tight some of
the lead should squeeze out. After it has
dried, a coat or two of paint is beneficial.

Details of the first postage stamps issued in
Tasmania ?
In 1853 Tasmania issued two stamps,
plateS for values of Id. and 4d. being engraved
on copper by C. W. Coard, and printed at
Hobart “Town Courier” office on unwater-
marked paper. These were quaint designs,
having a small profile of the Queen in the
centre, surrounded by the name “Van Diemen’s
Land” and the value in words. The Id. was
rectangular, with hollow corners, the 4d
octagonal. Of the higher value two plates were
engraved, differing slightly in detail.

WAIT TILL THE SCALE
TIPS YOUH WAT . . .
If you want value for your money, now
is NOT the time to spend it. The reason?
Putting it briefly, there is more spending
money in Australian pockets to-day than
ever before . . . and industry has not yet
been able to produce sufficient goods to
absorb that pent-up buying power.
Two things can happen. We can spend
recklessly, buy whatever we fancy at
•whatever the cost. Then sheer weight
of money would send prices sky-rocket-
ing —they could not be controlled. OR
we can limit our spending just for the
present, and wait until supplies are
plentiful and the nation’s economic
balance shifts in our favour. That is the
plan that must recommend itself to
every thinking man. Hold on to your
past savings, save all you can now, and
invest in Commonwealth Bonds and Sav-
ings Certificates.' Bonds and Certificates
earn you interest at better than bank
rates, and can be turned into cash any
time you need them.
Savings Certificates may be purchased
at any Bank or Money Order Post
Office, and advance subscriptions to
the next Commonwealth Cash Loan
may be made through any Bank or
stockbroker.
THIS IS HOW YOU CAN HELP TO KEEP PRICES DOWN
1, Spend wisely. Get full value. Buy owZy
what you really need. Save all you can. Hold
all your Bonds and Savings Certificates.
2 Share and share alike the goods available.
Don’t foster the black-market by paying more
than maximum prices. Check all prices with
the lists available.
3 Keep your own prices down. Don’t take
advantage of shortages to ask more for your
goods or services.
4. Pay your way—settle your debts —make no
new ones.
5. Invest your savings, at better than bank
interest, in Commonwealth Bonds and Savings
Certificates. When\ goods are plentiful again
you can make good use of the money you save
now—for then you will get more for your
money in everything you buy.

Men who saw war-time service in Britain enjoyed one feature
of life over there which is sadly lacking here. That is the cheerfulness, homeli-
ness and unfailing hospitality of British inns and hotels. For the British inn is
more than merely a place in which to drink ... it is the ordinary people’s “club, 1 ’
s Js , 1
a place to meet one’s friends, to sit in comfort and enjoy a drink as a pleasant
accompaniment to conversation and good fellowship.
Why should similar conditions be denied us here? Why should we be
obliged to drink at crowded bars, in haste and discomfort, with “one eye on
the clock” ? Until six o’clock closing is abandoned and hotel trading hours are
altered to meet the needs and wishes of the community, there can be no pro-
gress towards reasonable and moderate drinking conditions in this State.

Wasleing Slides on
WOMLAT
by DOUGLAS
ST EWAST
WHAT/ after all, is a walking-stick?
/\n extra leg. An extension of
the personality.
A terrible ining happened last
week to Mrs. Rollings’s extra leg. She
left it on the roadside, half-way up the
hill from the river. So Miss Perrott
picked it up and carried it back
to the boarding-house. And there it is
now, leaning against the wire-netting
fence beside Miss Perrott’s stick while
the two ladies are at breakfast: a clumsy
cudgel of salmon-gum beside a switchy
wand of willow.
“You’d think,” says Miss Perrott
wdth her little dry laugh over her
porridge, “with all this wonderful
scenery—Australian—just outside the
window—they’d hang up something to
advertise it. Push it. The tourists. People
need to be told,” She says the last word
with a ringing emphasis. “Told!” she
repeats. “The mountains —beautiful. And
they hang up a painting of the Mediter-
ranean. With bright blue sea and red
roses on the foreshores. Did you ever
see anything so ridiculous?”
She is compelling Mrs. Rollings not
only to listen to a conversation about Art
but to turn in her chair and look at that
picture. Just when she’s so nicely settled.
And her breakfast inside her, the sweet,
warm caressing tea —settling.
And to turn a short neck to look at a
picture behind the head requires an effort
that will heave the whole body—the tight
bosom in the brown -dress, the round
shoulders, the comfortable abdomen, even
the chunky hips ; and the short legs must
bp uncrossed under the table, and one
foot in its bright blue slipper must be slid
up the leg of the chair, acting as a lever.
Mrs. Rollings’s pink, downy face, under
the light-brpwn hair, grows positively red.
“Well!” says Miss Perrott trium-
phantly. “Don’t you agree? Even a
photograph would be better.”
“I’ve always been very fond of photos,”
says Mrs. Rollings.
Miss Perrott sighs.
“You’d better hang up one of those
photos you’re going to take from the top
of Mount Wombat,” says Mr. Rollings
with jocular sarcasm, cocking the tilt of
his nose at Miss Perrott.
They all glance through the window.
His dark back humped in the sky, his
huge flank filling the whole frame of
the window, Wombat the old-man moun-
tain goes on looking at whatever has en-
gaged his attention for the last two mil-
lion years. The blue of the morning lies
softly on his pelt of bush.
“You make no mistake about that,”
says Miss Perrott. “I’ll have her up on
the top of Mount Wombat this very day.”
“I’d never make it,” says Mrs. Rollings.
“Oh, goodness me, I’d die. Ted knows,
it’s all I can do to get through a good
day’s washing. I puff so much.” She
smiles and inclines her head, as if acknow-
ledging distant plaudits.
Mr. Rollings gives her “one of his
looks,” and coming from that solid face,
darting past that long nose that, perkily
tilted at the tip, ; seems to have given up
the attempt to race ahead of his dog-like
jaw, an impressive “look” it is. “Oh,
whatever have I said now?” says Mrs.
Rollings to herself. She licks her small
underlip and, encountering the fine golden
down below the rim, allows the tip of
her tongue to dwell on it, caressingly,
interestedly.
“You’re not really going to have a shot
at it today, are you?” asks Mr. Rollings.
“Of course,” says Miss Perrott with
asperity. “What do you think I’ve been
training her for?”
THAT is a question which, in a dim
sort of way, Mr. Rollings has been
asking himself, and the bedroom rmrtor,
and his wife’s hairbrush, and the board-
ing-house cat, and the amazing blue print
of the Mediterranean many times dur-
ing the past week. What does Miss
Perrott?
Well, any rate, a man never thought
he’d spend his holiday mooching round
the boarding-house on his own.
The young honeymoon couple, it
appears, when he is going in one direc-
tion to shoot rabbits, have just decided,
at the last moment, to go the other way.
The trout fishermen had never invited
him to share their dayjS on the river. And,
indeed, on the moifning when, having
carefully noted the track they had taken,
he had come upon them “by chance,”
it had not proved an exciting sport to
watch. From time to time they flicked
a fly upon the water, then sighed, changed
the fly, and flicked it over their heads into
the leafage of a gum-tree. Then faces
were set in misery.
Only old Mr. Partridge, who sat all day
on a cane chair on the verandah, and
who was a ship’s engineer recuperating
from an illness, seemed really to need
Mr. Rollings’s company. And old Mr.
Partridge would talk to anybody about
his gallstones. Mr. Rollings was growing
quite interested in them, but they were
not, as it were, sustaining.
By Jove, a chap thought he’d be —
you know, galloping over the hillsides in
his riding kit, with his lissome wife flying
beside him, her fair hair streaming on
the breeze. Or, if that was only some
dim fantasy built up out of talkie films
or the covers of American magazines, by
Jove, a chap thought he’d be —you know,
striding about the mountains in his grey
flannel trousers with his meek wife puff-
ing beside him.
Or at least a chap might—you know,
easy bag a fox or a kangaroo, something
fierce and dramatic like that, and bring
it back to the boarding-house and fling
it proudly at her feet; at any rate, get
her to drop her knitting and come and
have a look at it.
Mr. Rollings feels he is not getting a
fair go.
“You know,” he says, “I don’t think
you’d better go today.”
It is as if he has taken in his hand the
downy pink rose of Mrs. Rollings’s face
and crushed it.
“Why ever not?” demands Miss Perrott
frostily.
“You both got sopping wet through in
the thunderstoim tne other day,”
“But it’s a perfectly clear fine sunny
day. 5 ’ Miss Perrott glances out the win-
dow at old-man Mount Wombat, whose
dewy flanks, now that the mists are
vanishing, are turning gold in tne sun.
“All this rushing about. My wife’s
not used to it.”
“I’ve had her in training for a week! ”
As a ripple, washing on the shore and
retreating, makes the pebbles glitter, so
a stony light flickers across Miss Perrott’s
hard grey eyes.
“Aw, 1 don’t think you’d better go
today.”
Miss Perrott is a schoolteacher. But
Mr. Rollings is too large a boy to be
dealt with m the only possible manner.
“Oh, well,” says Mrs. Rollings, “1 sup-
pose I ought to be getting on with my
knitting. Really, the time I’ve been wast-
ing.”
fed Rollings, like Mount Wombat,
seems to grow larger and warmer ; the
mist has lifted from the rock.
BUT after breakfast, when the two
.adies sit on the verandah, facing the
wirenetting fence where their waixmg-
sticks await their pleasure, Mr. Rollings
is curiously uncomfortable.
Mrs. Rollings is industriously knitting,
Miss Perrott is snapping her fingers. The
grizzled ship’s engineer, with a jubilant
clearing of his throat, is on the point of
producing his gallstones.
The fishermen, of course, have vanished
down the hill. The honeymoon couple,
holding hands, are strolling up the road
in the opposite direction. Miss Perrott
gives no sign at all of going away and
climbing Mount Wombat by herself.
Hang it, a chap mooching about —
“Perhaps we’ll all go up Mount Wom-
bat together one day next week,” says
Mr. Rollings to the two ladies as he
departs ; strolling, “by chance,” after the
dwindling figures of the honeymooners.
“Now!” says Miss Perrott with satis-
faction. “Quick! Get your shoes on,
and we’re off.”
“Off?” says Mrs, Rollings. “Oh, foi
a walk.”
“For a walk to the top of Mount
Wombat! ”
“I could never do a thing like that.”
As a signal of finality Mrs. Rollings draws
her upper lip down over her lower and
caresses with it the down below the rim.
“Then you must come for a walk as
far as the crossing. We’ll take the billy
and have lunch. You could leave a note
for him.”
“1 wonder. I’d like to do that. I
suppose —1 could leave a note and ask
him to join us down there this afternoon.
He’d like to have his hot dinner at the
house before he comes down.”
“Good!” says Miss Perrott.
I T appears, however, .that Miss Perrott
1 is a wily person. Even deceitful. And
certainly very determined.
She stands on two flat boulders m the
shallow water at the crossing and posi-
tively hauls at Mrs. Rollings. Her sharp
nails bite into the back of the married
woman’s plump hand. There is abso-
lutely no need to cross the river for a
harmless picnic at the ford. But
“Come on, oh, do come on! Just
cross the river.” There is a wide smile
on Miss Perrott’s snub features. Her
grey eyes glitter like the pebbles. Her
walking-stick quivers as, balancing, she
thrusts it into the shingle under the water'.
Mrs. Rollings is clawing, as it were, at
the near bank of the river with her
clumsy cudgel of salmon-gum. It is an
extra arm. But her short, stout legs and
her two buniony feet in their torn patent-
leather shoes are already a yard out in
the waters, unsteady on a wobbling rock.
“Oh, no,” says Mrs. Rollings. “I
know what you want to do. Oh, no! ”
“What a goose you are, what a goose! ”
Miss Perrott is laughing. “We needn’t
even let on we’ve been anywhere near
old Wombat. You can tell that husband
of yours we werit for a stroll along the
river,”
“Oh, don’t, don’t!” Mrs. Rollings’s
rock wobbles as Miss Perrott laughingly
tugs her,
“Look out,” says Miss Perrott. “You’ll
be right in the water in a minute.”
“Stop it then! Stop!” Mrs. Rollings
is really angry.
“You come along with me right up to
the top of Mount Wombat! ” exclaims
Miss Perrott. She gives a hard tug, and
Mrs. Rollings with a scream and a flurry
is an elephant crossing the river. On to a
stepping-stone, off it, wetting her feet as
she leaps on the edge of the next, wob-
bling, gasping, floundering, and, with her
final bound for the further shore, land-
ing with a splash two inches short in the
shallow water. “Oh!” She shakes the
drops from her skirt.
Since this is Mrs. Rollings’s normal
method of crossing a stream, the pro-
ceedings are not quite as criminal as
might appear. Except that over the
river, and around by O’Flaherty’s white
farmhouse, and up the long central ridge
is the easiest track up Mount Wombat.
“Here,” says Miss Perrott. “You
dropped your stick.”
“My shoes!” wails Mrs. Rollings.
“They’ll dry in no time with the walk-,
ing,” says Miss Perrott. “Just look out
your feet don’t boil in this heat.” She
scoops up a billyful of water. “Here,
you take this. I’ll manage the rucksack
all right. It’s a stiff climb, I believe.”
“You’ve absolutely no right”
begins Mrs. Rollings, still really angry.
“Oh, pish, my dear,” says Miss Perrott,
putting an arm round the plump
shoulders.
“But he’ll come down here expect-
ing”—
“Come along!” Tenderly, gently, Miss
Perrott, with her arm round/those yield-
ing shoulders, leads a miserable, reluctant
and almost mutinous Mrs. Rollings on
the first, easy lap of the steep ascent of
Mount Wombat.
I S it the knell of doom that sounds from
* O’Flaherty’s white farmhouse? Fortu-
nately, it is not. But a large blue cattle-
dog, bristling and bouncing with rage, is
a terrifying object to Mrs. Rollings.
Miss Perrott swishes her willow stick,
and the large blue cattledog, who might
be the devil out of hell,,or even Mr. led
Rollings himself, is held at bay, then left
behind and forgotten ; or nearly forgotten,
because there will be tne return journey.
Is it all the fiends of the Pit that
scurry in a swarm on the gravelly mound
on the bare, red earth? Is it ten thousand
husbands? Is it a swarm of spinsters?
It is not. But the ferocity and multi-
plicity of ants are disturbing phenomena
to panting Mrs. Rollings, beginning to
grow pink on the gentle slope of the
ridge.
Miss Perrott stirs up the ants with her
willow stick. They bubble in millions out
of the little holes in their mound. They
hunt an invisible foe. “Ridiculous little
creatures,” says Miss Perrott.
Who lies dead on the track, her rib-case
picked white by the crows? Surprisingly,
it is not Mrs. Rollings. She has begun to
cheer up. There is a warm squeich in
her shoes, the bush is sunny and pleasant,
the cicadas sing on the branches, the
blue day with its few white galleons of
cumulus makes glad the heart. How high
in the world they are! And after all
that was quite a good story Miss Perrott
had thought up to deceive Ted. After-
wards, long afterwards, when they are
back in Sydney, she will tell him how they
climbed right to the top of Mount Wom-
bat and he never knew. With the end
of her cudgel of salmon-gum she taps
happily on the skull of the old dead ewe.
“I’m beginning to feel peckish,” says
Miss Perrott. “I suppose it’s one o’clock.
Oh, well, we should be on top by two at
the latest. We can hold out till then.
Good heavens, how you perspire!”
“I’ll be all right as soon as I have a
good cup of tea,” says Mrs. Rollings,
glancing at the billy which she carries in
her left hand. “If there was a creek any-
where, or a spring”
“All dry,” says Miss Perrott, leaning
forward a little under the weight of the
rucksack. “It’s really very waim today.
Quite hot. I wonder what’s in those
sandwiches?”
Mrs. Rollings is using her breath for
walking just at this moment. But a little
later on, when she is leaning against the
bole of an ironbark, “Did I ever tell
you?” she asks, “1 used to be a Miss
Ham before I was married.”
What an extraordinary remark! Screw-
ing up her small face, Miss Perrott peers
astonished at her companion. “Why!”
she says, “You funny old thing, I believe
you’re having the time of your life.”
“It is nice, isn’t it?” says Mrs. Rol-
lings. “But I shouldn’t have let you do it.”
“Look! ” says Miss Perrott. “There, on
that stump. Do you see it?”
The earth is red, the fallen leaves are
crackly, the boles and the foliage of the
gum-trees have a hard glitter in the sun-
light. But this is like a waterfall, like
moonlight, like a candle, like a nymph,
like a young girl—cool and white and
soft in the harsh Australian noon. So
unexpected, so beautiful, so pure.
“Oh,” cries Mrs. Rollings, “the flowers.
Oh, a whole spray of them.”
“Clematis!” Miss Perrott exclaims,
running down into the gully.
“You shouldn’t go off the track... Be
careful of snakes,” Mrs. Rollings calls
after her. But Miss Perrott is flying for
the blossoms.
She plucks the spray and comes breath-
less back to Mrs. Rollings. “How lucky
we are!” she cries. “Just that one spray
in the whole of the gully. Look, aren’t
they pretty! Like stars. It’s yours. I
give it to you.”
“Oh, I couldn’t,” says Mrs. Rollings.
“You keep it.”
“Here!” says Miss Perrott. She does
not put the gift into Mrs. Rollings’s
hands, but binds it swiftly into her hair.
A pat, a twist, a hairpin, a weaving of
brown hair and green tendril; and now
the stocky, plump, round-shouldered
woman with the pink face wears in her
hair a cool and shining chaplet of the
white clematis.
“It makes me feel peculiar,” says Mrs.
Rollings. “Like —like a mermaid.”
Miss Perrott smiles her wide smile.
“Leave it on! ” she cries. “It suits you.”
LOUD sing the cicadas in the hot bush.
Hardly noticed before, but towering
now and dramatic, the cumulus piles it-
self in walls and battlements beyond the
spine of the mountain. Cleft with purple
hollows is the cloud-bank, shining and
looming above them like a great white
cliff.
Mrs. Rollings swings the billy in her
hand as, crowned with flowers, she
hurries on her happy way. Not needed
now, for her step has lightened with her
heart, her stick drags bouncing behind
her like the tail of a kangaroo. Arid
merrily from side to side, cutting off the
heads of plants, swishes the willow wand
of Miss Perrott. An avalanche of ice-
bergs and marble hangs miraculously sus-
pended in the sky.
“Do you think we’d better have lunch
here?” asks Mrs. Rollings as the two
happy ladies reach a green knoll where
the ridge spreads out in a saddle.
“On top! On top!” cries Miss Perrott,
pointing uphill to the left where the head
of old Wombat, crowned with its own
white flowers of cloud, rears rocky and
immense.
“But it’s so steep. Straight up. And
all that loose rock. It would be so much
more sensible just to have lunch here
and then go home.” Some strange insect
is sinking its little claws into Mrs.
Rollings’s skull. She puts up her hand
and discovers the wreath of clematis
flowers. Dare she pull it away? She
dares not.
“You’re coming up to the top of that
mountain if I have to push you!” ex-
claims Miss Perrott.
“But it’s late. I’m hungry,” Here on
this knoll many ridges meet and spread
out. Behind the mountaineers as they
face the distant glittering speck of the
boarding-house stands the old brute
Wombat. To the right is the narrow
sheep track they have followed through
*the undergrowth. To the left is the
descent to the wilderness. “I’m going to
sit right down here where I am and have
my lunch.” •

UNCALED ADDITIONS
JAPS AS PRISONERS.
(From an article by a Manchester “Guardian” special correspondent.)
Three-quarters of a million Japanese
prisoners fell into Lord Louis Mount-
batten’s hands when the war ended,
Most of them still await repatriation.
Their feeding is a problem, but their dis-
cipline is not.
Even in Java and Sumatra, where many
of them are still outside the zones under
our military control, they have caused
very little trouble. They work reason-
ably hard and obey orders. Indeed, it is
commonly said in South-east Asia that
they are the ideal material for a mercen-
ary army. They did and do exactly what
they are told. Their atrocities behind the
fines, their suicidal bravery in the field,
and their present equanimity are all of\a
piece. Anyone who now expected to find
them looking down-hearted would be sur-
prised. One sees them chatting cheerfully
and laughing among themselves almost as
much as the Italians in England. What
they are thinking is a matter, of anxious
speculation to many far-seeing soldiers
and others in South-east Asia.
These Japanese prisoners, unless they
fought in Burma—as tens of thousands
did not—have never known what it is to
be beaten in action. They had carried all
before them in the early stages of a war
that ended without giving them direct
evidence of British or American strength.
The atomic bomb and the end of the
myth of the God-Emperor were remote
events. Few, if any, senior British officers
fail to remark that—except for the casu-
allies on our side-—it would have been
much healthier if the great amphibious
operation prepared for the recapture of
Singapore had been fought to a finish,
These undefeated Japanese have not
been separated from their officers and are
due to return to their home islands. This
is generally regarded in South-east Asia
as likely to make a handsome present of
ijianpower to whatever subterranean
Fascist forces may be at work in Japan,
However, since it was clearly impossible
to smash the Japanese officer corps to
anything like the same extent as the Ger-
man, it is difficult to see how these
potential dangers could have been
avoided,
Moreover, the future political set-up in
Japan is so unpredictable that it is argued
that the returning veterans may, before
they are too old, provide grist for a Com-
munist mill.
NICE WORK—IF YOU CAN GET IT.
(N.Y. “Journal-American” financial editor Leslie Gould, on U.N.O. and other juicy screws.y)
The prize jobs today are those on
the three international organisations —
U.N.0., the World Bank and the World
Monetary Fund. The salaries are “net
after taxes.” If there are any income
taxes, these will be paid by the organisa-
.
tions. Tins is belter than most movie con-
tracts and practically any job private
industry can offer.
The president of the World Bank is to
receive $30,000 a year “net.” Or lax free
It isn’t the Russian way to hide
their light under a bushel; they
are great advertisers. Witness, for
example, the huge statues to the
Red Army erected in Berlin and
Vienna. These statues seem to pro-
vide some bitter, ironic humor to
the inhabitants —for the lady inter-
preter who guided me on an auto
trip in Vienna said that the Vien-
nese call the great shaft topped by
a Russian soldier “the Statue of the
Unknown Looter.” Scripps-
Haward correspondent.
as far as the recipient is concerned. The
same for the managing-director of the
World Monetary Fund. The secretary-
general of U.N.O. receives $26,000 a year,
plus an “allowance” of s2o,ooo—all “tax
f ree »»
Thus the top jobs in the World Bank
and the Monetary Fund are the equiva-
lent of $BO,OOO a year if the receiver were
subject to U.S. income taxes. If the
$20,000 “allowance” is omitted the
U.N.O. boss’s pay would equal $50,000
a year American. Including the $20,000
allowance as income, his total pay would
be the equivalent of $150,000 American,
Much better than Mr, Lie could do in
Norway.
The World Bank and the Monetary
Bank each have in addition to the “boss
job” 12 executive directors, each with an
alternate. The executive directors each
receive $17,500 “net,” and their alternates
$11,500. When Russia joins the organisa-
tion, there will be an additional executive
director and alternate. The pay of the
executive directors is the equivalent of
$32,000, and the alternates around
$lB,OOO.
In addition to these tax-free posts,
there are many more lower down the
scale. The same in U.N.O. There are
15 department directors —so far —who
receive $ll,OOO “tax-free” salary, plus
expense allowances ranging from $3OOO
to $6OOO a year. And a flock of assistant-
secretaries, receiving $3500 a year, plus
expenses.
The “tax-free” salary was decided upon
because some of the countries with repre-
sentatives on the boards do not have
income taxes. Therefore, a representative
from any other country with an income
tax would be at a disadvantage. In this
way all appointees are equal as to “net
income.”
Taxes are paid on the income, but by
the fund, the bank or U.N.O. rather than
by the individual. The American head
of the bank will receive $30,000, but the
bank will have to pay Uncle Sam a tax
of around $50,000. The same for all
Americans receiving these “international
salaries.”
This opens the door to a lot of inter-
esting possibilities. The next thing will
be to make all political jobs—for these
are political, don’t kid yourself there—
“tax free” or “net after taxes.” But best
of all are the “allowances” or “expense
accounts.”
WEAKNESS OF DICTATORSHIPS.
(Writer of the article here condensed from N.Y. “Times Magazine,” Major H. R. Trevor-
Roper was the British officer in charge of the investigation into the truth of Hitler’s death -
He here discusses the fundamental weaknesses of Hitler’s and other dictatorships .)
At Nuremberg Hitlerism is undergoing
a searching post-mortem.
This post-mortem is an examination
not only of Hitlerism but of all dictatorial
power; for there is no fundamental
difference between one absolutism and
another. The differences are superficial
and temporary —differences of person-
ality, policy and national traditions;
fundamentally they are all similar; and
it is possible by identifying and detach-
ing these superficial dissimilarities to ex-
tract and examine the common denomi-
nator of dictatorship. And the condi-
tions which can breed so terrible a phe-
nomenon still obtain.
Hitler’s policy was in many ways
purely personal, especially at the end.
After the generals’ plot of July 20, 1944,
all the characteristics of Nazi policy re-
flected his personality, for by then he had
triumphed over his last internal enemy
and was free to ruin Germany in his
own way. The mania for destruction, the
obstinate refusal to yield or compromise,
the determination at whatever cost to
found a myth—these are all personal
characteristics illustrative not of dictator-
ship but of this particular dictator.
Policy is not inherent in any form of
government. There have been aggressive
and cautious dictatorships. It is the
organisation and the possibilities, not the
particular policies, which characterise
dictatorship as a form of government.
Then there are national characteristics.
Ideologies are the secular religions
which inspire revolutions; and, just as
Cromwell based his revolutionary power
on Puritanism and Napoleon his on the
Rights of Man, so Hitler based his on
Nordic mysticism, which is as character-
istically German as the others were Eng-
lish and French. What are the
remaining characteristics of the Nazi
dictatorship; the qualities which are not
personal to Hitler, nor merely representa-
tive of German aims, but typical of the
very form and structure of dictatorial
power?
Dictatorships, we were often told, are at
least efficient. They are not. During the
war the Nazis continually stated that they
were waging “total war”; that their
State was “totalitarian,” “pyramidal,”
“monolithic” ; that the efforts of all were
consciously and systematically directed
toward a single aim.
The reverse is the truth. In Nazi Ger-
many only policy was undivided —the
personal irresponsible policy of the dic-
tator, On an administrative level there
was a jungle of private empires, private
armies and private intelligence services ;
and Ribbentrop’s protest at Nuremberg
that foreign intelligence was supplied by
30 competing agencies is substantially
true.
In the uncertainty of politics every
man whose position makes him either
strong or vulnerable must protect him-
self against surprise by reserving from
the common pool whatever power he has
managed to acquire until in the end there
is no common pool at all.
Irresponsibility in the ruler causes
irresponsibility in the subject; the con-
ception of the commonwealth no longer
exists except in propaganda ; and politics
becomes the politics of feudal anarchy,
which the power of a despot (if he can
ride the storm) may conceal but cannot
conceivably alter.
This, I believe, is characteristic of all
absolute dictatorships, as is apparent
when the dictator dies in office or fails
to keep control. Then the concealed
struggles come to light and the feuda-
tories with their private armies bargain
or fight it out among themselves for the
succession,
The fact is that modern dictatorship
involves self-sufficiency and, therefore,
intellectual isolation. If people are not
Assertion that other Arab lands are
“the last place in the world” for Jews
to go to makes the Anglo-American com-
mittee’s proposal to dump 100,000 Jews
into Palestine by force all the more
monstrous. The Europeans, not the
Arabs, are responsible for the hideous
persecution of the Jews, but whereas the
Arabs have openly declared their willing-
ness to accept Jews in all their lands
except Palestine not one of the United
Nations when approached by the Anglo-
American committee would agree to take
any at all. — R. R. Stokes, M.P., in
London “Times.*’
allowed to go abroad or to read freely
or to listen to foreign broadcasts they
don’t understand how other people
think ; and isolation from the thoughts
of other people leads to an intellectual
and political fool’s paradise.
Finally, all dictatorships seem to pass
through certain regular stages of de-
velopment, Starting with revolutionary
power based on a revolutionary idea
which happens to symbolise the mood
of a people, they convert it into military
power based on success ; when the revo-
lutionary promise is betrayed and the
success runs dry they resort to naked
power based on political expedients and
a secret police ; but since these are in-
adequate in the long run the system is
overthrown. It is, I believe, the ultimate
inefficiency of dictatorial power which
causes the success to run dry.
Why are dictatorships ultimately in-
efficient? The answer is an old one.
Power corrupts. People too often think
in abstract terms. When individuals fail
in their social function or are oppressive
in performing it they are apt to say that
the State will do it better, as if the State
werd a benign impersonal agency. But
the State, in fact, consists of persons too ;
to take power away from individuals and
concentrate it in the hands of the State
without institutional safeguards against
its abuse is simply to give certain in-
dividuals a power so great that they are
corrupted by the exercise of it and, since
it is too vast to be centrally controlled,
it falls apart into private empires.
Dictators are simply men who, profit-
ing by such abstract thinking and posing
as saviors of society, secure this power
and then, while still supported by popu-
lar emotion, destroy the institutional safe-
guards and abuse the power. The cor-
ruption, the inefficiency, the loss of suc-
cess and resort to naked power then auto-
matically follow. /
Looking back at Germany we naturally
ask why, then, did the Germans so nearly
win the war? There is an answer. First,
they didn’t win the war. Had Nazism
been efficient they would either not have
made the war or they would have won
it. Second, political efficiency consists
not in the availability of resources but
in their use. What nearly won the war
were German resources and the German
Army ; what lost it was the dictatorship.
OCCUPATION COSTS WORRY U.S.
(Condensed from “United States News,")
Rising cost of occupation in Europe
and Asia is beginning to have a marked
influence on U.S. foreign policy. Secre-
tary of State Byrnes is insisting for the
United States that peace be established in
the world so that the peoples of con-
quered nations can get back to work and
thus support themselves. Allied super-
vision then would continue, but on some
basis less expensive than full military
occupation.
Russia, to date, has been the chief bene-
ficiary of American policy. Her 2,000,000
troops in Eastern Europe are living off
entries °“ u P ied ‘ At Bame ,ime
ba ™ b -u taking rej»rauons
the occupied areas, dipping them
of livestock, of food of machinery, ana
of industry. U.S. and Britain agree ,
addition, to transfer to Russia mdustna
plants and machinery from their zones


in Germany, thereby reducing the earning
ability of the people in those areas.
Mr. Byrnes now lays down the dictum
that the U.S. is to quit the system of sup-
porting Russia through U.S. contributions
to the occupied countries. Shipments of
reparations to Russia, further lowering
earning ability in Germany and Austria,
also are to stop until the big Powers agree
on some basis of peace. As things stand,
the cost of occupation and the cost of
postponing a peace settlement are so high
that U.S. officials are beginning to fear
the American taxpayer will revolt.
The British announce that their costs
of occupation in Germany come to
£80,000,000 a year, and $2,350,000,000 a
year is what American taxpayers are to
pay annually for the U.S. occupation of
Italy, Germany, Austria, Japan and
Korea. If Congress raises Army pay by
50 per cent., as now seems probable, total
occupation costs would go above
$2,500,000,000 a year.
Occupation costs of these dimensions
were not anticipated by the United States.
But none of the enemy areas, it now turns
out, is in a position to feed or clothe
itself, let alone thousands of U.S. troops.
Such industry as escaped bombs and
reparations looks to U.S. for raw
materials with which to get back to work.
Repayment comes later, if at. all.
Prospect of high occupation costs go-
ing on year after year, without any real
hope of repayment, has been one of the
factors impelling Secretary Byrnes to seek
a peace settlement. Another factor is a
fear that Europe cannot stand another
winter with millions of Russian occupa-
tion troops living off the land.
A Fantastic War Story.
(.Revealed in a London “Times” letter by R. G.
Steel, who was a British liaison officer with
" the U.S. First Army.)
It may be of interest to record the fol-
lowing detail of the beginning of Von
Rundstedt’s Ardennes offensive, since no
one appears to have mentioned how
easily the German spearhead could have
reached the Meuse at Liege during the
first two days.
In the middle of the morning of Sun-
day, December 17, an American M.P.
stationed one mile east of Malmedy was
directing all traffic south to St. Vith. Hav-
ing so directed a column of armor, he
recognised the tanks, after they had passed
him, as enemy—and proceeded to “get
the hell out of there.” It was just here
that an American battalion was overrun
and massacred about an hour later.
If this German column had kept
straight on, ignoring the M.P., they had in
front of them at that time first Malmedy
(one mile), defended by one platoon of
Engineers with two bazookas and some
small arms; next a road fork, left to Spa
(nine miles), which was United States First
Army headquarters, protected by
16 90mm. A.A. guns only ; right to Ver-
viers and thence by main road to Liege.
Verviers was the location of IX T.A.C.
Air Force fighter control room ; and there
were no fighting troops at all on the
whole of the route to Liege. Also at this
time there was a dump bordering the
Waimes-Malmedy-road (by which the
Gentian armor had advanced) containing
3,000,000 gallons of petrol. By consum-
mate organisation, combined with courage
and luck, the whole of this was with-
drawn northwards by First Army per-
sonnel, without the enemy being aware
of the proximity of oil.
The German armor, which turned south
and thence to Stavelot, was stopped there-
after by hastily deployed and unsup-
ported 90mm. A.A. guns in its attempts
to probe north again by successive roads
leading to Liege, until the situation Was
relieved by the arrival of the 28th Divi-
sion and the 82nd (Airborne) Division.
I have never heard whether the solitary
American M.P. was decorated for his part
in saving Army Headquarters and Liege.
Why Tension Persists.
(From an article by William Henry Chamberlin
in “Wall-street Journal.")
Molotov mistakes the mood and temper
of the American and British peoples if
he imagines that they desire their Gov-
ernments to carry on relations with the
Soviet Union on a basis of unconditional
surrender.
It is undeniable that a state of chronic
and rigid tension has grown up as be-
tween the Soviet Union on one side and
the United States and Great Britain on
the other. It would be a good thing for
international reconstruction if this ten-
sion could be broken. But it is emphati-
cally not the consequence of any Ameri-
can or Anglo-American desire to domi-
nate the world. Such defensive steps as
the United States and Great Britain have
taken, singly or in common, have repre-
sented a very tardy and reluctant re-
action to a process of Soviet expansion
which started even before the end of the
war, which has 'brought all Europe east
of the Stettin-Trieste line into the orbit
of Russian influence, which has stretched
out toward Iran and Manchuria.
The basic causes of this tension are
not to be found in this or that minor
detail of territorial readjustmen. or repa-
rations arrangements. They are four in
number. First there is the fatalistic be-
lief which Stalin and other Soviet leaders
have repeatedly expressed that there must
be ultimately a conflict between the
Communist and non-Communist worlds.
Second one must note the repeated
breaches by the Soviet Government of
its treaty obligations (its pacts of non-
aggression with Poland, Finland and the
Baltic States, for instance; its agreed
dates of evacuation in Iran and Man-
churia ; its promises of “free and unfet-
tered elections” in Poland, etc.), and the
inevitable feeling of insecurity which
such an attitude on the part of a strong
military Power brings to the rest of the
world. Third, there is the use of Com-
munist parties and affiliated “front” or-
ganisations for fifth column purposes in
foreign countries.
Finally, there is the complete inequality
between Russia and the Western world
as regards news of each other.
If and as these causes of tension
are removed by changes in Soviet policy,
Molotov will find no reason to complain
of lack of will to collaborate with the
Soviet Union on equal terms. But so
long as these causes remain tension will
persist, even though compromises and
adjustments on individual issues may
take place.
Job Ahead in India.
( Condensed from a report by a London
“Times” correspondent in India.)
The saddest thing about the three
months’ proceeding [of the British

INDIA JUNGLE POLITICS.
Cabinet mission in India] has been the
only too obvious desire of the majority
and minority communities to avoid
shouldering responsibility for leading the
country towards independence unless they
have British backing for their exaggerated
claims upon other communities. This
might be laughable if it were not so
tragic.
It is difficult to see how the Viceroy,
who now faces the tremendous burden of
administering the country’s affairs with
officials only, can hope to exorcise the
spirit of intolerance and intransigence.
In the past Indian leaders have
often pleaded for a “change of
heart” on the part of Britain. Today it
is clear that, without a change of heart
within the Indian body politic, democracy
cannot flourish in India.
Of the magnitude of the Cabinet mis-
sion’s achievements in the face of almost
insuperable obstacles there can be no
doubt. To minds obscured by communal
considerations —as those of most Indian
politicians are —there is doubtless ample
scope for imputing ulterior motives ; and
this will certainly be done. But broad-
minded men will pay tribute to the selfless
pertinacity and acumen with which the
three Ministers and the Viceroy induced
the two parties to accept a long-term
plan, which, whatever its demerits, does
represent the highest common factor of
agreement.
The country now faces the prospect of
electing a Constituent Assembly which
will hammer out its independence. No
one pretends that this will be other than
a protracted and herculean task. If it
is not to fail it must be conducted in an
atmosphere free from sectarian strife.
The Cabinet mission has proved
its good faith ; it is now for the Indian
leaders to show their vision and sincerity
by abating their bigotry. The only alter-
native is civil corpmotion and bloodshed
throughout the nation.
{The following is from a letter by Charles
Lesley Ames, featured in N.Y. “Herald
Tribune.”)
A major famine is about to occur in
India—as great as and perhaps greater
than any in recorded world history. Its
prospective extent can be reduced and
millions of lives saved, but there is no
possibility that it can be wholly avoided.
The situation as it stands now may be
summarised as follows .-With the rest of
India upon the practicable-minimum
basis, there are 120,000,000 people facing
starvation —not merely dangerous under-
nourishment, but death by starvation.
On present prospects the very temperate
official estimate is-that at least 15,000,000
will die. For the rest, extreme under-
nourishment means susceptibility to dis-
ease and, especially during the short term,
to epidemic cholera and plague.
Should health-control measures against
these diseases, which have been so remark-
ably effective during the last 20 years,
break down through sheer lack of man-
power to maintain them, the death
toll may easily rise to a total of
25,000,000. Completely to prevent this dis-
aster would require 4,000,000 tons of
grain, which would mean, in terms of
wheat, about 133,000,000 bushels. In the
present state of the world, with
U.N.R.R.A. and the President’s Famine
Relief Commission reaching for every
possible source of supply, no such amount
from present world supplies can be hoped
for.

Last January, after heroic efforts, General
Marshall succeeded in getting the Chinese
Government and the Communists to agree to a
comprehensive truce and unity programme.
But he had no sooner left China for a visit to
the United States than the truce was broken,
with the new-found unity torn to shreds. Since
General Marshall’s return, despite all he has
been able to do, the situation has gone from
bad to worse. As General Marshall has pointed
put, China is now threatened with “a general
conflagration.”— Washington “Post.”

Now that Hong Kong is being set on its
feet again, the question of its future is begin-
ning to be discussed. As the only spot left in
China, except Portuguese Macao, free from the
devious administrative methods of the Chinese
it enjoys advantages that are appreciated by the
immigrant commercial community from the
mainland no less than by British and Ameri-
cans. But the question of restoration to China
does not escape being raised. Nationalists here,
as elsewhere in South-east Asia, are vocal. They
do not, however, carry great weight at present.
The next move seems most likely to be, (in the
opinion of the best-informed people on the
spot') for a greater measure of self-government
within the colonial system. The unofficial
population of Hong Kong means to have a
greater say in running the island. — Manchester

The Dominions have very little say in ques-
tions of foreign policy and defence, which are
the primary responsibility of Great Britain.
This has worked well enough up to now. But
times have changed. An Empire defence policy
has become urgent. In any future war there
would be no time to concert plans and build
up defences. These must be ready if the Empire
is to remain secure and world peace be pre-
served. There is no policy —not even for
Britain. Let' it be granted that the outlook
is obscured by many uncertain factors. It is
not known how effective U.N.O. will become
or what will be Britain’s contribution to its
armed force. The effect of atomic power has
not been thoroughly explored. Such doubts
should serve to strengthen, and not weaken,
the Government’s determination to protect the
interests of Britain and the Empire countries. —

A prominent leader in the [U.S.] Administra-
tion’s food programme states bluntly that
“Russia is playing harsh power politics with
food.’’ In reaching this decision he pointed to
the fact that not only is Russia historically a
grain-exporting country, but it now controls
the chief food surplus-producing countries of
eastern Europe. He points out that Russia

Committees of U.N.O. have been at work
trying to make plans for the use of force by
the organisation when it shall have decided to
use force to preserve peace. These meetings
have not been held with the fanfare of the
Security Council meetings, with all the invita-
tions and temptations to make speeches. Bui
accomplishments are very small indeed. Repre-
sentatives of other countries report that the
Russian attitude is purely passive. The Rus-
sian representatives are sorry but they cannot
comment on this proposal or that because they
do not have instructions. Weeks go by and
the instructions do not come. It is like getting
a Russian visa. Members of the committees
say that on minute details like the provision
of a system of common signal work to be used
there is nothing doing on getting the Russians
to take a position.— From N.Y. “Times”
manager Edwin L. James’s weekly column.

The Department of Commerce in Wash-
ington predicts it will be at least five years
before the world food situation returns to
normal. Even so, many fear the forecast is
too optimistic. For, unless and until there is
peace, displaced peoples cannot return to the
soil, settle down and raise crops.— N.Y. “World-
Telegram.”

For centuries it has been the main element
of British policy to preserve the independence
of the nations of Europe, so that the Conti-
nent shall not be dominated by any single
Power. If the independence of the European
nations is the proper policy of the United States
it finds itself at one with the traditional policy
of Britain. This independence was the motive
of Britain’s resistance to the Continental hege-
mony attempted in turn by Spain, the French
monarchs, Napoleon and the Germany of the
Kaiser and of Hitler. The defensive principle
involved was clear enough. So long as the
nations of the Continent were independent, re-
sisting absorption by a single monarch, a
Napoleon, a Kaiser or a Hitler, the Continent
would not become one great Power, so pre-
ponderant that Britain would be defenceless.
This self-same principle, which has so often
guided British policy, must guide the United
Nations or any other international authority
which hopes to survive.— Norman Angell; N.Y.
“Herald Tribune” letter.

In the opinion of responsible Security Council
members, tactics used in U.N.O. by the Soviet
Union have hampered Moscow’s objectives and
minimised Moscow’s influence, not only in the
Security Council but elsewhere in the world.
The Russians have created in the Council a
mental barrier that makes it difficult for the
Soviet Union to get a sympathetic hearing
even when it has a good case. And what
should be of some significance to the Russians
is that the only groups in the U.S. who are
pleased with their tactics are those who have
been hostile to the Soviet Union ever since it
came to power. — N.Y. “Times” staff corre-

The Spaniards accuse us of selective indig-
nation and of selective democracy. No com-
mittees are appointed by U.N.O. to investigate
conditions in the totalitarian States which are
under the protection of the strong. What-
ever may have been Franco’s ultimate inten-
tions, it is a fact that he did, and that
Bulgaria did not, resist Hiller’s pressure to join
in the war, and the contrast between our atti-
tude to Bulgaria and to Spain takes a lot of
explaining—in Madrid. My own sympathies
are with the Monarchists, who are seeking to
restore constitutional government. 1 dislike
all forms of totalitarianism, but, though I am
a democrat, I am not a selective democrat. —

All the trouble that is going on now in India
and Egypt and in Palestine does not prove that
the Empire is collapsing. On the contrary,
if anything, it means that it is not. For what
is happening in Egypt, in Palestine and in India
means that Britain is changing her policy to
meet the new conditions and new demands of
a new post-war pre-atomic era. So far from
these trouble spots meaning that the Empire is
finished, they mean that it is changing with
these changing times—a pretty good sign of life
and vigor.— N.Y. “Times” London staff corn-

SHOOTING NIAGARA.
"Before and since the spy revelations there has been ‘a series of exits’ of Russian officials and military o Canada, via the U.S.A. An early emigrant, Colonel
Zabotin, was reported dead of ‘heart failure’ after reaching Moscow.”
“Ivan, how’s your heart?”

Another exodus of Russians is reported
from generous and hospitable Canada, in
whose magnificent gifts to all its war
partners their country shared, and two of
the bolters have been named. They are
Bitalli G. Pavlov, Second Secretary, and
Ivan I. Krotov, Commercial Counsellor.
The first emigration began when it was
realised at the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa,
temporary home of Comrades Bitalli and
Ivan, that Gouzenko, a code clerk, who
had been impressed with the Canadian
way of life and horrified by the dirty
work on which the Soviet Embassy was
employed, had revealed the facts of
wholesale espionage and corruption to the
unsuspecting Mackenzie King Govern-
ment. One of the earliest emigrants was
a Colonel Zabotin, organiser of military
intelligence in British North America for
the champion double-crossers. It came
out that Colonel Zabotin had got back to
the Workers’ Paradise and died within
two days of “heart failure.” Since 1917
millions of other Russians, and of recent
years countless Poles, Letts, Lithuanians
and Estonians, have died in Russia from
the same cause, mostly in concentration
camps, on slave-labor works and in dun-
geons and. prison grounds, a favored
method of bringing on “heart failure”
being the insertion of a bullet in the back
of the neck,
Gouzenko’s spilling of the beans led
to a gathering-in of Canadians intimate
with Zabotin and his gang, and the evi-
dence against them was sifted and re-
ported on by a Royal Commission on
which there were two Supreme Court
Justices. Its conclusions were presented
to Parliament by Mr. Mackenzie King.
The old Prime Minister straightway be-
came a target for such of Moscow’s in-
vective as was not directed against the
British and American Governments, but
he refused to be angry, at least in public,
and his Government methodically pro-
ceeded with charges which had mean-
while been laid. One of the accused
was a Canadian-born woman of Russian
origin, employed as a cipher clerk at the
Foreign Office. Confessing her guilt,
without showing any penitence, she was
sentenced to imprisonment for two years
and a half. Another was haled from
Parliament itself, being a Communist —
the only one in the Legislature—who called
himself Rose, though his real name is
Rosenberg and he is a Polish Jew who
was brought to Canada in boyhood.
Found guilty on the first of five charges
of betraying official secrets to Canada’s
infamous ally. Rose or Rosenberg re-
ceived a six years’ sentence.
The second flight of Soviet Embassy
gangsters seems to have occurred between
the arrest of Rosenberg and the com-
pletion of the Royal Commission’s final
report, which was tabled in the Canadian
House of Commons last week. It runs
to 250,000 words, and amounts to the
most damning record of base ingratitude
and seditious conspiracy in the history of
the relations between countries at peace,
trust having been repaid with treachery,
good with evil. Going into the origins of
the Communist conspiracy against
Canada, it fixes 1924 as the year in which
the conspiracy was organised, being then
“directed from Russia and operated by
Canadian sympathisers.” Little was
achieved till 1942, when a Major Sokolov
arrived, “ostensibly as a Soviet inspector
to work in Canadian factories under the
aid-to-Russia programme.” Then came
Colonel Zabotin, not then suspected of
any cardiac weakness, who “took over the
military intelligence system in 1943 and
immediately expanded the organisation,
with a steadily increasing Russian staff,”
and with Left-wing journalists creating a
favorable atmosphere by making
romantic figures of all Russians, especi-
ally the beautiful girl snipers.
All this, it should be noted, was long
before Moscow could have had any
notion that the Canadian Government
was privy to the atom-bomb experiments,
though it was after all the Canadian
secrets it might get in the military, poli-
tical .and industrial fields by espionage
and subornation. Nor did the late un-
lamented Zabotin confine his exertions to
the first of the Dominions. From Ottawa
he “helped to supervise and finance an
organisation of agents operating in Euro-
pean countries,” while continuing to
direct the “powerful organisation in
Canada” and keeping in touch with
“several parallel undercover systems” en-
trusted to “members of the Soviet Em-
bassy,” one being “a secret political
system, which acted as a ‘pilot’ for
Communist activities,” and received “in-
formation from the Canadian Foreign
Affairs Department and the British High
Commissioner’s office.”
Other passages of the Royal Commis-
sion’s report are pertinent to the Com-
munist conspiracy in all English-speaking
countries, especially Australia, and a
reference to one of the defunct Zabotin’s
financial operations (“he caused 10,000
dollars to be transferred with the aid of a
commercial firm in New York”) should
whet the expressed curiosity of Mr.
Walsh, the Queensland Deputy Premier,
as to the source of “Australian”
Communist funds, apparently unlimited.
No such curiosity is expected of Federal
“Labor” or its Mr. Mountjoy, M.H.R.,
instrument of a ruffianly Communist
attack, chosen that it might be made
under cover of privilege, on a private
citizen of unblemished reputation whose
only son, a Sixth Division captain, fell
fighting in New Guinea:
From what Gouzenko told the Commis-
sioners it is clear that Communists in
democratic countries changed long ago
from a political party into an agency and
network of the Soviet Government, to act
as an instrument for creating unrest, provo-
cations, etc. Russia, Gouzenko said, is
preparing for a third World War and the
Comintern is continuing to direct inter-
national Communism.
Evidence showed that the Communist
party is getting control, through the elec-
tion of secret members to directing com-
mittees, of as many types of functional
organisations as possible, including trade-
unions, professional associations, youth
movements and civil-liberties leagues.
An additional objective is to accustom
young Canadians to an atmosphere of con-
spiracy, double life and double standards.
A most startling single aspect is the un-
canny success with which Soviet agents
have found Canadians who were willing to
betray their country.
Under-cover Communists were instructed
to assume, when necessary, an anti-Com-
mimist line.
On the day when the substance of this
shattering Canadian report reached Aus-
tralia, the six Dutch ships held up in
Australian ports since September by Com-
munist action in aid of “our Indernesian
comrades,” murderers of three Austra-
lian servicemen as well as many Tommies
and a multitude of Dutch, moved out of
Australian ports to meet a collier, being
bound for N.E.I. They were empty of the
great Australian cargoes they were to
have carried, carrying only, as it were, the
ashes of a trade with great possibilities,
destroyed by Communist larrikinism.
Their skippers and crews were un-
wittingly aided in their passage by
their Communist enemies, whose
energies had been concentrated on the
strike of Queensland meatworkers, coal-
miners and wharflaborers. Masters and
pupils alike. Communists are clumsy oafs,
stultified by their own venom and
stupidity.
With Washington passing the loan to
Britain by an unexpectedly large majority
and refusing one to Russia, and with Mr.
Byrnes, referring to the iniquitously
delayed Peace Conference, intimating
that American plans for the pacifica-
tion of Europe will be impeded
no longer by Russian “doubts and sus-
picions, aloofness, coldness and hostility”
it was a bad week for Communism every-
where. So bad a week for the world-
wide conspiracy that even Dr. Evatt,
a dumb witness to the hold-up of
the Dutch ships and Mr. Mackenzie
King’s statement on the Communist
conspiracy against Canada, felt em-
boldened for the first time to have a
crack at Moscow. Being in the U.S.A.,
and suiting his words to the temper of his
audience, as he generally does, he “criti-
cised decisions of the Big Three without
consultation with the smaller Powers, such
as the Pacific concessions to Russia, which
have almost hopelessly prejudiced a final
settlement.” On none of his fleeting
visits to Australia did Dr. Evatt ever
object to “the Pacific concessions to
Russia,” On the contrary, he said at
Canberra four months ago, turning to
condemn the “appeasement” of Hitler
and his associates, that “having come to
know some of Russia’s greatest states-
men, I take the view that the Soviet
Union’s policy is directed towards self-
protection and security against future
attacks.”
Making of a Martyr.
Though Draga Mihailovich had been
hailed as “brother-in-arms” by Eisenhower
and decorated with the Croix de Guerre
by De Gaulle, from the day he fell into
Partisan hands his ultimate fate was
everywhere known to be as foregone a
conclusion as the name of his captors sug-
gested. He was in the hands of Com-
munist “justice,” for which Russian
“trials” over the years had clearly estab-
lished the pattern. The accused, as in
Mihailovich’s case, is pre-judged to be
guilty; vital evidence on his behalf is
refused by the “Court” ; the “trial,” apart
from the political use that might be made
of it, is a mere formality, and verdict and
sentence are as foregone as what they
end in—death.
The pattern was followed without devi-
ation in the Mihailovich “trial.” It be-
gan on June 10 and was protracted to
July 15. The accused, arraigned on
charges of treason and collaboration,
pleaded not guilty. He appeared before the
Court a grey-bearded, bespectacled figure ;
as one who knew himself as tried and
condemned and what was in store for
him, and who calmly accepted the inevi-
table. The New York “Times”
representative wrote of his “maintain-
ing a quiet dignity, and replying to
questions in a firm voice.” Asked his
occupation, Mihailovich said “General of
the Army.” He gave his birth date as
Aprjl 17, 1893.
As early as the second day of the
“trial” the N.Y. “Times” representative
noted Mihailovich as “obviously tiring
under the continued hammering of the
prosecution,” a hammering he would all
through, in the Communist fashion, be
subjected to also in his dungeon. A most
important characteristic of these Soviet-
pattern Communist “trials” —their mon-
strous difference from British and indeed
all civilised Court procedure—is that the
Bench itself is part of the prosecution,
and in this case it consisted of three
officers of Tito’s army! Its sessions lasted
for seven hours daily; enough, without
what the accused would undergo between
sessions, to cause the N.Y. “Times” re-
porter to note on only the fourth day;
The seven-hour sessions are exhausting
for everybody trying to follow the case
and evidently a far greater strain on
Mihailovich. Already he has declared
once, “When I am too tired, I say yes.”
That —one of the most tragic and also
revealing utterances ever heard in a Court
—of course had no effect. Even earlier
Mihailovich had sought a delay to
enable him to see further to his
defence in view of what had been
brought against him in the Court,
but this was refused “Three civilian
attorneys made up his defence staff,”
the N.Y. “Times” man reported, “but
during the proceedings they were rarely
permitted to put in a word.” Fur-
ther from the same first-hand report of
the proceedings:
At another point General Mihailovich
turned to the Court and said; “There is
very much material for my defence which
is not available to me.”
“Where is it?” the Court asked.
"You took it,” the defendant replied.
That was far from being the only
defence material unavailable to Mihailo-
vich. A British offer to send witnesses
for him was rejected. The United States
officially sent two Notes to Yugo-
slavia seeking permission for American
aviators and military officers who were
associated with Mihailovich during the
war to submit evidence. Tito’s Govern-
ment replied to the first Note with a flat
refusal, to the second that it would ignore
all such Notes.
So the “trial” proceeded. Apart from
occasional scraps, Australia heard little
of it, and there was no sign of protest
here from “civil-rights leagues” and the
like. That, however, is nothing unusual at
this time in Australia, where world infor-
mation and public indignation are alike at
a very low ebb. The same cannot be said
of America, where Mihailovich has been
an outstanding item of news and com-
ment ever since he fell into Tito’s hands ;
no doubt occasion for the pinning of
yet another Moscow medal on the Par-
tisan leader, who wears a dozen or two
of them, as big as saucers, on both sides
of his chest. When permission for U.S.
airmen and soldiers to give evidence was
twice refused, and the “trial” had thereby
been exposed for what it was, indignation
and disgust with the proceedings were ex-
pressed throughout the whole range of the
American press, Communist publications
excepted.
The New York “World-Telegram”
declared \ “The trial of Gen. Mihailovich
smells to heaven.” “He has been con-
demned in advance,” wrote Dorothy
Thompson in the Leftist “Post”; “Tito’s
Government has announced ‘his crimes
are fat too horrible to allow discussion of
whether he is guilty or not.’ ” And the
“Daily Mirror,” pointing out that the man
was sacrificed to a deal with Soviet im-
perialism, pleaded with its countrymen:
“Let it not be said that his blood Is upon
America —that Americans deserted and
forgot a friend.”
That Americans did not do so was
shown in their Government’s two Notes
to Tito, and by the number of Americans
who came forward to testify for him. In
New York a Commission of Inquiry
took evidence from members of Ameri-
can missions officially attached to
(1) Mihailovich and (2) Tito, and
American airmen forced down by enemy
action in Yugoslavia. Concluding its
hearings in May, the commission re-
ported :
None of the evidence tended to show any
collaboration between General Mihailovich
and the Axis Powers. On the contrary,
all the evidence tended strongly to disprove
the existence of any such collaboration.
All classes of witnesses were constantly on
the lookout for collaboration, had full
opportunity to discover it, and would be
expected to have discovered it had it
existed.
Mihailovich continued to conduct hostile
operations against the Germans and
Italians even after the Allies had, stopped
sending him supplies. He and his forces
made every effort to protect, rescue
and return to Allied territory all Allied
airmen forced down in territory under
their control upwards of 500 were
rescued and repatriated in this way.
There was also testimony that Mihailo-
vich had built an airstrip for use in evacu-
ating American fliers, but that this had
had to be abandoned “under Partisan
attack made with the aid of supplies
dropped by American ’planes to Tito’s
forces.” One of the members of Ameri-
can missions with Mihailovich, Captain
Walter R. Mansfield, has written exten-
sively in defence of the Serb leader, with
whom he spent six months before be-
coming an American guerilla leader
against the Japs. The sum of Captain
Mansfield’s findings might serve as the
final comment on the entire Mihailovich
affair: “Most of the case against him
rests on sheer falsehoods ; the remainder
is compounded of gross distortions. The
evidence seen by Americans calls for one
verdict only—complete exoneration.”
That, however, was not to be
expected in Belgrade. Nor was it
to be hoped that the expectation
in May of the N.Y. “Journal-
American” would be realised: “The out-
cry of civilised people against the planned
murder of Mihailovich must have had
some effect.” When Communists are in
a position to hold a “trial” no amount of
outcry can avert planned murder. But
at least it can serve the purpose, which
the outcry in America has served there,
of making it positively known that
this murder was planned, the waiting
firing squad completing the martyrdom.
The Larrikin Strikes.
Parties to a civil dispute take it to a
Court, which hears their case. Its judg-
ment (or that of a Court of Appeal) is
final, and is binding on both parties.
If damages are awarded against one party
he pays them.
In these disputes there is no substitu-
tion of violence for litigation. The parties
do not commit or join together with other
interested parties to commit illegal acts.
They do not vilify the Court or announce
that they will not abide by its decision, or
try to hold the community to ransom
until their demands are granted. Respect
for or fear of the law is an effective re-
straint.
Contrast with this the industrial posi-
tion. Arbitration Courts have been estab-
lished for determining all applications
for variation of conditions and wages in
industry. They issue awards, whose detail
leaves little room for dispute. Strikes in
Queensland, except after specified condi-
tions have been complied with, are
illegal. Has this conferred industrial
peace? On the contrary ; the recent long
struggle is only one of a continuous series
of strikes in the Commonwealth affecting
our vital industries and bringing our
economic life to the verge of chaos.
Why, then, is there this almost con-
tinual disorder in our industrial life as
contrasted with our civil affairs?
The answer is, of course, the weakness
of our Governments in dealing with
powerful unions to which they are bound
by bonds of sympathy.
An employer’s rare breach of the in-
dustrial laws is met-*-proper!y—with im-
mediate prosecution. Unions are sus-
tained in their illegal actions and defiance
of the Court by immunity from prosecu-
tion, by private parleys, by protracted
conferences to discuss whether they will
or will not obey the law.
Trade-unionists have had conferred on
them a new freedom, freedom from fear
of the consequences of their illegality.
A long course in immunity from
punishment has educated them to the
well-founded belief that they may secure
the best of both worlds ; the benefits of
arbitration plus what further advantages
they can wrest by direct action from the
employers and the community.
The return of Queensland strikers to
work after holding up the community for
17 weeks was not a vindication of arbitra-
tion, The striking unions tested the
strength of their members against the
endurance of the ptiblic, and the public
won. The unions lost the struggle when
their members were exhausted, not be-
cause they decided to abide by the in-
dustrial laws. Th6* public killed the
strike; the Government merely buried it.
If the existing legal provision for
the prosecution of ,a union and ox
unions guilty of an illegal strike had been
enforced, and particularly if those persons
who insolently and openly incited others
to break the laws hap been prosecuted,
arbitration would have been vindicated-*
not otherwise. \ .
There are no doubt' weaknesses in me
arbitration system; incieed, it is not hard


to suggest amendments. The lodgment
with ffie Court by every association and
union on registration of a substantial sum
in escrow, to be forfeited on conviction of
a major breach of the law, occurs to one
immediately. Machinery to ensure a
clean-up in the taking of ballots is obvi-
ously essential. To be an effective deter-
rent the period of deregistration should
be at least a twelvemonth.
Then, of course, there should be laws —
if they do not already exist—to prevent
citizens, their businesses, their livestock
or their goods from being declared
. “black.” That opprobrious word “scab”
should not be permitted to be used
against men whose only “crime” is to
refuse to commit an illegal act. But even
if such laws were placed on the Statute
Book, where would they get us without
enforcement?
The impossibility of imprisoning large
numbers of lawbreakers has been men-
tioned as an excuse for permitting law-
lessness. The reason for not prosecuting
the small number of Communists who
make it their business to incite unionists
to break the law has, so far, not
appeared. In any case, it is obvious that
the lav/ can be upheld by other methods
than wholesale imprisonment.
All the advantages that unions have
gained through the Arbitration Court and
industrial legislation are hostages for theip
respect for the law. Compulsory unionism
and preference to unionists are the foun-
dation-stones of union strength. The
announcement by a determined Govern-
ment that the penalty of labor lawless-
ness would be the cancellation of these
privileges would almost certainly curb
the present defiance of constituted
authority.
When the old English tradition of the
rule of law is reawakened in our com-
munity, when those evil persons who
preach sedition are suppressed, when the
bitterness of the recent struggles has dis-
sipated, then it will be time for employers
and employees to meet in the realisation
that their mutual welfare and the greater
good of their nation are bound up in
their country’s productivity, for which
they are responsible; that they are not
enemies but colleagues.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Half the 1920 Price.
Wheatgrowers insist that John Curtin
gave them an undertaking that they
should get the full net proceeds of the
sale of their 1945-46 wheat as their share
of the rehabilitation business. He doubt-
less remembered what full payment for
1919-20 wheat meant to the Westralian
farmers of those days, among whom were
many Diggers, farmers and farmers’ sons,
a large proportion of whom had been
coming back (the earliest arrivals
wounded from Fromelles and the Somme
campaign) for three years. They got
round 10s. a bushel, and with taxes,
freight-rates and farm-labor wages light
in those days, it set them on their feet
for years.
Mr. Curtin is gone, and with other
leadership “Labor” has other ideas.
Under the Scully stabilisation scheme
growers of 1945-46 wheat are to get ss.
2d. a bushel, less rail charges—6d. to Bd.
a bushel —but plus something out of the
“realisations” on wheat exported, as a lot
of the 1945-46 wheat will be. At the
current world price, which looks like ex-
ceeding 11s. a bushel sterling, the “Gov-
ernment,” if permitted by the electors,
will hang on to at least 3s. a bushel of
these farmers’ money against “stabilisa-
tion” for the next four years. Some
growers will die this year; others will
give up wheatgrowing—many farmers
protest that ss. 2d. a bushel is barely
equal to the cost of production—others
again will have little or no 1946-47
wheat, even if there is a turn for the
better in N. S, Wales and Westralia. In
these cases it will be useless to ask the
“Government” to return the 3s. a bushel.
With death or misfortune all interest in it
disappears ; “no equity.”
This is the latest of those “Labor”
principles, and it is only for land men.
“Labor” would not think of applying it
to coalminers as part of the “control”
measure now being hatched out by Mr.
Chifley, McKell and Co. It would not
dare to tell any body of Government
clerks that it proposed to guarantee their
salaries for five years but would hold
three-tenths of their 1946 earnings to
“stabilise” pay against cuts in other years.
Were the “principle” generally applied
there would be a general strike, with
everyone in it except the politicians.
Knockers at Work.
Students of the New Journalism cannot
fail to have noticed that it is saturated
with Laborism, the work of Bright Young
Men whose views and personal preferences
often make nonsense of the anonymous
editorial column.
With the approach of the Common-
wealth elections, and with things looking
bad for the dismal crowd in office, the
privileged Labor writers are getting in a
lot of sly partisan work,
One of their devices is to predict certain
success for the kind of M.H.R., nearly
always a dud, who got in for the
first time in 1943 and hasn’t a China-
man’s chance this time. Another is
to shed crocodile tears for Mr, Casey be-
cause, returning after most of the elec-
torate organisations had chosen their
candidates, he was not presented with a list
of soft snaps and invited to take his pick,
Another is to vamp up supposed Liberal-
C.P. quarrels, and another to allege ram-
pant Liberal hostility to Mr. Menzies.
But the favorite dodge is to allow, with
an appearance of magnanimity, that
Liberals and Country party may gain
six or seven seats in the House. If,
opposed to a party which has been
in office for five years, and which has be-
come a pain in the neck to multitudes of
electors, justly fearful of the future, they
couldn’t do better than that they might
as well go out of business,
At the elections of 1917 and those of
1931 Federal “Labor” was reduced to in-
significance in both Chambers. Going on
the by-elections for Federal Wimmera
and Henty (Vic.), the Leg. Assembly con-
“LABOR” ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD.
"Senator Donld Grant, was to have been Dr. Evatt’s ‘adviser’ at the Paris Peace
Conterence, but failed to find any and was recalled to be on hand with his Referendum
Billed vote go again a s observer,’ as well as ‘adviser,’ and to go on, with Senator
Codings, to the umpty-umpth I.L.O. Conference in Canada.”
“What’s that you’ve got there, Mr. Observer-Adviser?’’
“A copy o ma bulk for the enlichtenment o ma fellow-delegates. Could ye
hae a new edeetion struck off by the Depan-r-tment of Eenformotion?”
tests in Greenough (W.A.), Bremer (Q.)
and Burnside (S.A.) and the half-
dozen Leg. Council polls in West-
ralia and Tasmania, in all of which
the Labor vote showed a sharp de-
cline, even in Labor subdivisions—the
Labor or Labor-supported candidates in
Henty, Wimmera and Greenough were
badly beaten, while “Labor” lost a Leg.
Council seat in W.A. and another in Tas-
mania—a repetition of 1917 and 1931
cannot be dismissed as improbable. But
it wouldn’t need a landslide to deprive
“Labor” of its majorities in both branches
of the Legislature, in the House immedi-
ately, in the Senate after the end of June.
In 1931 Labor gained two seats and
lost 31. The two seats gained were Bris-
bane and Oxley (since Griffith), and both
are now shaky; even in 1943 Brisbane
gave Mr. Lawson a majority of only
1105 —an increase of 636 on his
1940 majority—in an effective poll
of 61,193, The 31 seats lost were
Barton, Calare, East Sydney, Eden-
Monaro, Gwydir, Hume, Lang, Mac-
quarie, Martin, Parkes, Parramatta,
Watson (then South Sydney) and
Werriwa (N.S.W.); Ballaarat, Batman,
Bendigo, Corangamite, Corio, Flinders,
Indi, Maribyrnong and Wannon (Vic.);
Adelaide, Angas, Boothby and Grey
(S.A-) ; Fremantle (W.A.) and Bass, Deni-
son, Franklin and Wilmot (Tas.). Twenty-
four of these electorates (Angas has dis-
appeared) went “Labor” in 1943. Many
can be regained from “Labor,” and that
with no great turnover of votes, now that
“Labor” has been found out. And there
are Lilley (Q.) and Perth (W.A.), whose
“Labor” members, elected three years ago,
were respectively the first since 1913
(when Lilley became an electorate) and
1906 ; Swan (W.A.), which has had two
“Labor” members (one sat for a twelve-
month) since 1901 ; Forrest (W.A.),
which has had one “Labor” member
since 1922, and Wakefield (S.A.), which
has had two “Labor” members since
1903, as well as Eden-Monaro (two
“Labor” members since 1901), Martin
(two since 1922) and Parkes (two since
1901).
A gain of 14 electorates would give the
Opposition groups a majority of four in
the House. It would be 20-16 in the Senate
if they won all the seats which have to
be contested. This would be no new ex-
perience for “Labor,” which failed to
win a Senate seat in 1917, 1919, 1925 and
1934.
The D. 0.1. Quiz.
It’s from “Illabo Ike,” who claims to be
16:
Dear Mr. Editor I am a N.S.W. schoolboy
and the Department of Information only sent
them things to the Victorian kids but my cousin
in Tallangatta he’s getting on for 17 sent me
one and I thought you would like to know
what the N.S.W. schoolboys think so I’m
answering the 20 questions and you can print
them if you like.
(1) Do you feel that you can stand On your
feet when you leave school, or will you need
help from your parents, troth financial and
advice?
Course I won’t. I’ll get me union ticket'
straight away and even if I don’t get a job
isn’t there that Commonwealth unemployment
scheme to pay me a coupler quid a week?
(2) What are your plans for the period
immediately after you leave school?
Get a tailor-made suit and save up for a
motor-bike.
(3) Do you want to go to the University?
What, and have to do more lessons, don’t
be a dope.
(4) Do you believe that scholastic success
necessarily brings success in after-life?
No. Mr. Chifley and Mr. Calwell and all
them blokes ain’t scholars.
(5) Do you want to go on living in your own
town or do you feel that city life is more
desirable?
If I could do a bit of rabbitting every Sunday
I wouldn’t mind.
(6) Recently it was decided that radio is not
suitable for the teaching of sex knowledge. Do
you agree with this?
Look, my old man keeps cows.
(7) Have you a steady girl friend?
No, but Hedy Lamarr is my ideel.
(8) Do you think that the war has .brought
about a decline in morals generally?
DonT Imow, but I’ve heard Mum say the
night life in Illabo is pretty wild.
(9) Do you think that the American influence
brought about by the war is a good thing for
Australia?
Yes. My uncle used to have a taxi down
in Sydney. Now he’s bought a bonzer pub
and he says I can go and stay there free for
the holidays. Whacko!
(10) Do you think that Australia’s future is
bound up with that of Britain or of America,
or should we stand on our own feet and be
independent?
Australia has a very great future and should
not let anyone interfere with it. Other nations
want our wool and wheat and there is a very
great future before us. Since the war there is
a demand for our goods and this shows that
we have a very great future but I don’t know
about it being bound up although my old man
often says we have political constipation.
(11) Do you believe that the atomic bomb
should be controlled by a world Organisation,
or should it be kept by America, Britain and
Canada?
No. Because if they did it would only cause
trouble.
(12) What do you think about U.N.0.? Will
it keep on successfully, will it come to an end,
or will it just go like the League of Nations?
At our school they told us the League of
Nations was wiped so I don’t see how it can
be going on. About U.N.0., it has been left to
Dr. Evatt, the Minister for Extra Territories,
and he knows a lot about it, having been
trained as a lawyer before he became a doctor.
(13) Do you think that there should be com-
pulsory military training?
Not unless they bring in conscription with it.
(14) Do you feel that women should have
equal standing with men and be equally paid?
I haven’t thought about it, but my ideel is
Hedy Lamarr.
(15) Do you think that women should go on
with the kind of work that they have been
doing throughout the war, or should they go
back to their pre-war jobs?
Haven’t thought about that, either, but gee it
would be alright if they was all like Hedy Lamarr.
(16) What are your favorite sports?
Bill O’Reilly, Dinny Pails, Joe Louis and Bill
McDoon. N.B. Mr. McDoon is captain of our
football team.
(17) What films do you like?
Anything with Hedy Lapiarr in it.
(18) What kind of music do you like —classi-
cal, jazz?
I reckon swing is the goods, but it’s got to
be hot and sweet and they got to give out and
stay in the groove.
(19) What do you think about modern comic
strips?
There is one good thing about comic strips—
you can read ’em and you don’t have to
think.
(20) Who do you think is the greatest Aus-
tralian of recent years?
Beraborough.
Unwarranted Elation.
Last week readers of Sydney’s morning
papers were led to believe that Com-
munist control of the Sydney waterfront
was at an end. “Red Grip on Union
Smashed” was the “Daily Telegraph’s”
way of conveying the pleasing intelli-
gence. And all because the Sydney water-
siders had rejected their branch presi-
dent, Nelson, their branch treasurer,
Moran, and a “vigilance officer” on an
issue which had nothing to do with Com-
munist control or the restoration of
A.L.P. ascendancy, though that was
alleged. These fellows were unseated be-
cause they were held responsible for an
alteration of working hours which has cut
into the wharfies’ earnings.
Healy, general secretary of the Water-
side Workers’ Federation, and one of the
most dangerous Communists in Australia,
was retained in office by a massive
majority. So was Roach, his assistant.
This means that Communists remain in
control of the Federal executive, and the
powers of any Federal executive are vast,
as any branch that has challenged them
knows only too well, 'particularly in the
case of the Ironworkers’ Federation.
Healy’s partner, Thornton, has recently
been re-elected unopposed as Ironworkers’
boss. Thomson, boss of the Building
Trades Federation and its most notorious
go-slow artist, has also been re-elected —
for “the eighth time,” a Communist named
Gibson boasted to a Melbourne University
audience. To this the boaster added that
“Jack Brown, the railwaymen’s leader” —
he is Victorian secretary of the A.R.U.,
composed entirely of Government em-
ployees—had “increased his majority by
1000 at the union elections.” Other
sentences which broke from Gibson in
his burst of elation were “Hundreds of
thousands of workmen are electing and
re-electing Communist leaders” ; “Com-
munists control the Miners’ Federation,
the Waterside Workers’ Federation and
the Seamen’s Union, and our weekly the
‘Guardian’ has increased its Victorian
circulation from 16,000 to 19,000 in a few
months.”
While it is something gained when
Communists are dissevered from union
jobs, especially as they are exploiting
sectarianism as well as envy, hate and
greed, there is no sign of a general move-
ment in this direction, nor is much to be
expected from A.L.P. action, which so far
has been a mere pretence and a useless
expulsion of words. Nearly five weeks
ago the N.S.W. A.L.P. executive was go-
ing to do terrible things to the Com-
munist party and its subsidiaries. So far
not one of them has come to pass and
the declaration against Friends of the
Soviet has been watered down to admit of
Mrs. Jessie Street coming out again as a
“Labor” candidate for Wentworth.
The Australian people will have
to look to law to protect them against
the nation’s internal enemies, who have
inflicted so many miseries upon it and
blackened its name —to law, made com-
prehensive enough to cover every Com-
munist operation and intrigue and rigor-
ously enforced at every point, even to
imprisonment and deportation. And there
will be no such law nor any such en-
forcement if “Labor” is returned to office.
"Work for Everybody."
“Full employment is the principal
aim of the Chifley Government,”
remarks a costly advertisement, complete
with picture of Dr. Evatt, and alleging
that his “foreign policy” will give every-
body a job—though as altered by Com-
munists it kept wharflumpers * and
seamen and ship painters and dockers and
workers engaged on making or processing
things for the N.E.L continuously
idle. It would be interesting to have the
Chifley-Evatt definition of employment.
To most people it means work, and if
the Chif.-Evatts imagine for a moment
that Australians haven’t their hands full
of that they’ve another think coming. It
is work to stand in queues at the butcher’s
every morning and work to search for a
bit of coal to keep the kids warm at
night; it is work to fight for standing-
room on a Government vehicle in order
to get to the job or get home from it; it
is work —and dashed hard work —to find
supplies of anything with which to keep
employees earning; and there’s more
work in working out their tax deduc-
tions every week, an unpaid job thrust
on overworked accountants. There is
work in finding a bit of tobacco or a
cigarette paper or a new hat or a pair
of socks or a singlet. People are work-
ing in some Government departments
and have sinecures in others.
“Full employment,” is it? The “Labor”
version of the thing has hit Australia
fair in the teeth, but not much of it is
producing anything except worry and fear*

CARRERAS LIMITED-OVER 150 YEARS' REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
A vast amount of rubbish is being
written about R. G. Casey. Sydney
“Daily Mirror” touched bottom with the
assertion that he was coming out against
Menzies in Kooyong (Vic.). Then “S. M.
Herald,” which supported members of
four parties in 1943, put it to him that he
should stand as an Independent. Mac-
Kinnon, the Liberal nominee in Wannon
(Vic.), has offered to make way for him
—which is very generous of MacKinnon.
But Casey was the man for Corio (Vic.)
in 1931, 1934 and 1937, and he should
have announced months ago that he
would have another shot at Corio. In
1934 he beat Dedman by an absolute
majority (8873) greater than Dedman’s
three absolute majorities—l77B (by-
election) and 2752 in 1940 and 2721 in
1943.
Both wings of the Opposition in the
House put up a stiff fight against
“Labor’s” Wheat Stabilisation Bill, but,
naturally, it had ho effect on a crowd
which, with very little knowledge, is sure
it knows everything. There is no sug-
gestion that “stabilisation” at ss. 2d. a
bushel is required to let the British have
wheat at the reduced price agreed to by
the Canadian farmers. This mob
wouldn’t do anything like that.
It was decided last week that Senator
Grant was to proceed again to Paris as
“adviser” or “adviser-observer” to Dr.
Evatt, Colonel Hodgson, Keith Officer
and a lot of other gentlemen. Then
it was discovered that Senator Col-
lings, rising 81, was one of the
few members of Caucus who hadn’t
had an overseas tour, with salary
continuing and all expenses paid, so it
was decided that he should go to the
1.L.0. conference in Canada with Grant
as a companion—and others, of course.
1.L.0. conferences are now held every two
months' or so. Providing “Labor” poli-
ticians with a pretext for deadhead trips
is the only purpose they serve.
Fadden has worked it out that
“Labor’s” income-tax “concessions” (its
own term) favor the single man. On an in-
come of £3OO a year the “concessions” are
2s. 4d. a week for the bachelor and Is. 6d.
a week for the Benedict; on £5OO a year,
the “concessions” are 7s. 6d. and 4s. l id.
a week respectively—4s. sd. where there
are two children. Still, there is a certain
dingy consistency about these “conces-
sions” and others of the kind. N.S.W.
“Labor” predominates in Canberra, as
well as in Sydney, and the “sport,” gen-
erally a hard-faced person without family
obligations, has become the main object
of its solicitude.
Forde, getting out of his Liberator at
Brisbane on one of his “regular week-
end trips,” with secretaries and advisers,
to Capricomia, called at the Lands De-
partment and discovered a water scheme.
Whereupon, as member for Capricomia,
“where practically all the cotton grown
in Queensland is produced,” and where
the electors have to be kidded to as never
before, he burst forth with great talk
about a £655,000 water scheme as though
he’d thought it all up himself. There
was a stunned silence in the Lands De-
partment, for the scheme was no more
than tentative. Minister Jones recovered
sufficiently to murmur that “Mr. Forde’s
statement” was “somewhat premature.”
Back in Canberra, Forde announced an
increased cotton bounty, and mumbled
something about its being “a national
matter” when Harrison said seven-eighths
of it would go to Forde’s constituents.
Canberra claims to have demobilised
445,000 members of the services. Inves-
tigations in Melbourne show that Army,
Navy and R.A.A.F. departments are still
hanging on to 137,823 square feet of
office space in city buildings. The two
sets of figures don’t harmonise.
Westralia’s Labor Government was first
in with its financial figures for the year
to June 30, and they were ghastly.
Though the special Commonwealth grant
amounted to £950,000, the most massive
since special grants began, the Govern-
ment wound up with a deficit of £912,559,
the worst since the depression period. The
staggered “West Australian” figures it as
“a symptom of mortal sickness in any
ostensibly self-governing community.”
Some foolish young fellows at Mel-
bourne University were beguiled into de-
nouncing the sentence on the Communist
stooge Dr. Nunn May and the Canadian
proceedings against Dr. Boyer. Then the
Canadian Government tabled the royal
commission’s report on the operations of
Russian spies and home-grown and im-
ported traitors in its Dominion, so gener-
ous with its gifts to Russia and to the
other fighting United Nations, Australia
among them; and such of the foolish
young fellows as are not casehardened
Communists must have felt like going out
and kicking themselves.
A member of the legal firm in which
Senator McKenna, now a Minister, is a
partner appeared for D’Alton, sometime
State Minister of Forests and Common-
wealth High Commissioner to N.Z., at
the inquiry conducted by Judge'Kirby,
and another member of the firm was
D’Alton’s counsel when the accused was
committed for trial in Hobart. It may
be all right, but if Menzies or Spender
could be imagined as taking a brief for a
party-member charged with corruption
the entire Labor and Communist press
would be at him, horse, foot and artillery.
Since broadcasting of debates began
the electors have received a great deal
of information from newspapers as to
the ways of Parliament, and some mis-
information. The suspension of Tommy
White moved a Great Daily to make this
contribution to the unwisdom of the!
ages;—
Suspension is merely a disciplinary
measure. Expulsion of a member is
binding for all time. * There is only one
case on record in Australia—that of Mr.
Hugh Mahon.
There have been other cases, and
“binding for all time” is nonsense. As
for Mahon, he was elected member
for Kalgoorlie on December 13,
1919, and expelled on November 12, 1920
(actually the seat was declared vacant by
a vote of the House); but this did not
prevent his contesting the by-election on
December 18 —they were sudden in those
days. Defeated by George Foley, a
former Labor M.L.A. turned Nationalist,
he never came back.
Misinformation Minister Calwell’s
snobbish desire to get the young gentle-
men of his department who process films
that nobody wants to look at set up in
the elegant surroundings of a boom-
time mansion in Melbourne’s poshiest
suburb, Toofak, got a setback when Ken-
nelly, the State Minister for Works, told
Prahran City Council that it would not
be allowed to vary its regulations affect-
ing residential areas so that Calwell
could use the place as a factory for his
quiz experts and film operators. Calwell’s
baronial department has a two-years’
lease at £l7OO p.a. Hamilton, the archi-
tect M.L.A., wants the place for home-
less servicemen and their families, but
Barry, Minister for Housing, refuses to
take it over. Most citizens think that
D.0.1.’s exalted intellectual activities
could easily be carried on in a tin shed.
The Queensland Industrial Court’s
judgment in the case where an Old Digger
member of the Storemen and Packers’
Union protested against a levy for the
striking meat-workers may turn out to
be very important. Under the union
rules the objects for which levies could
be made included “assistance to the
wives and families of fellow-unionists in
time of need.” The union bosses pleaded
that payments to the Brisbane Labor
Council strike fund were legitimate under
this clause. The judgment read:
We do not agree with this interpreta-
tion. We are satisfied that the three
amounts of £250 each were made for an
illegal purpose; that is to say, for the
purpose of furthering the- interests of men
already on strike.
The levy was declared illegal and the
union ordered to pay the Old Digger’s
costs.
Playford, asking the Commonwealth
Grants Commission for £1,101,365 so
that he may balance his State’s 1945-46
accounts, got a ’ pat on the back from
the chairman, A. A. Fitzgerald, for “the
way State accounts have been kept and
the close control of public expenditure.”
The last five words will bring a wry
smile to N.S.W. faces. McKell’s “Gov-
ernment” throws money about like
water, is bpsy with schemes for a grand
new racecourse and a new Parliament
House and great departmental palaces, in-
volving the destruction of historical edi-
fices, and has coyly admitted that “over
£300,000” was lost on its trams and!
buses in 1945-46.
S.A. railway revenue was down
£600,000 in 1945-46, partly as a result of
N.S.W. coal stoppages and “absenteeism”
(i.e., loafing). The position as regards
N.S.W. coal for gas and other services is
chronically bad. Factories are not in so
desperate a case. Asked by the Com-
monwealth Grants Commission if his
Leigh Creek coalfield was carrying on,
Playford replied feelingly: “Yes; it has
been the savior of South Australia:
nearly 200 factories are using Leigh
Creek coal.” He had to overcome the
hostility of the “Labor” Government at
Canberra to get Leigh Creek going.
Twitted by Bruce Pie, leader of the
Q.P.P., with travelling to Queensland
every few weeks by special ’plane, accom-
panied by a retinue of secretaries and
advisers, Forde got this off:
The aircraft used on most of these
visits is a Service machine. Similar ’planes
are placed at the disposal of Cabinet
Ministers When I had to travel to
Central Queensland from Canberra and
back by rail, the journey occupied a whole
week. I can now visit Rockhampton by
air at regular intervals at week-ends.
Well, it’s better to be' born lucky than
rich. Forde presumably supports the
Clapp-Ward plan to keep ordinary people
in railway trains, though he has one of
those fluid-drive Chryslers, with chauffeur
an’ everythin’, for times when ’planes are
grounded.
Priceless bit from the London “Times”
Parliamentary reports (June 28):
Rat-catching: The total number of
people employed in the rat-catching
department of the Ministry of Food is
298 and the cost is £108,000; 169 of these
are engaged in administrative and clerical
work, and 104 of them in catching rats.
(Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Food.)
Candid, anyway, especially as the Govern-
ment that made the admission is socialis-
ing everything at a great rate. Once a
colony of drones is comfortably settled
in a Government department, it is the
hardest thing in the world to dig them
out, and Socialist Governments don’t try.
A Dr. Morris Perlzwig, “head of the
political department of the World Jewish
Congress,” is in Australia with the report
that “powerful anti-Semitic movements
have developed in Poland, Hungary,
Rumania, Austria and Slovakia,” in all of
which countries there are large Russian
armies as well as departments headed by
commissars—though the gentleman didn’t
say that. He did say that he and his
Congress looked to Australia for support.
Surely he should know that the role has
been offered to and accepted by Arthur
Augustus Calweli, that exponent of
elegant diction and Chesterfieldian
manners, who worked himself up into a
great state of indignation because “these
English people” (a 8.8. C. man, his wife
and two children) had arrived in Mel-
bourne without his permission, and
blithely announced that he had issued
permits for the introduction of 2000
European Jews. His arithmetic has been
called into question.
Hopeful newspaper predictions that the
Victorian Liberals and Agrarians would
quarrel over their ticket for the Senate
and split violently were not fulfilled.
There was an amicable agreement on the
choice of Senators Brand and Leckie and
Senator A. J. Fraser and W. L. Moss—
who stood three years ago. Their names
will appear on the ballot paper in alpha- ■
beticai order, and with Brand leading they
will take no end of beating. The Old
Digger and Leckie have already been
successful at two elections.
Debating Communism with Edmunds,
M.L.A, for Hawthorn, in the Melbourne
University lecture hall, a glib Com. named
Gibson asserted that “mankind is moving
towards Communism like a landslide.”
False as a statement of fact, as all the
recent elections have shown —even in
abject Czechoslovakia, the Communists
are a minority of .38.1 p.c., and in
France their vote has slumped to 27.2 p.c.,
in Italy to 18.9 p.c., and in the U.S. zone
of Germany to 3 p.c.—and a characteris-
tically stupid illustration. What is a land-
slide but a useless and often dangerous
Shifting of inorganic matter, earth and
rock or the two combined?
Blain, the Digger member for,the NX,
had six opponents when he was a p.-0.-w.
in a Japanese hell-camp. Now he is to
have two,-a Dr. Somebody, nominated by
a Darwin “ ‘Labor’ electorate council,”
and a Mr. Murray, nominated by the
South Australian A.L.P. There are
already the beginnings of a Donnybrook,
the president of the electorate council
having charged in with a statement that
“Mr. .Murray will get the support he
deserves, and that, in my opinion, is very
little.”
“The only thing that petrol rationing
is doing is to saddle Australian taxpayers
with the £19,300 a month which it costs
to run it,” remarks a joint statement of
the R.A.C.Q. and N.R.M.A., quoting
Senator Ashley’s own figures and his
statement that petrol consumption is now
very little below 1939 figures. How-
ever, motorists should cheer up. Release
of more petrol is sure to be a “Labor”
election bait.
Realising the party’s deficiency in
servicemen candidates, the Tasmanian
A.L.P. is running a ticket of four for the
Senate, though there are only three
vacancies. The fourth man is Justin
O’Byrne, a Post-war Reconstruction
Department man, who as a flight-lieuten-
ant was a prisoner-of-war in Germany for
upwards of three years.
Nothing is too insignificant for a
bureaucrat’s attentions. A Melbourne
hairdresser helped to relieve the cigarette-
paper shortage by hanging up an ancient
roll of rice-paper in his shop and invit-
ing customers to cut a hunk off. He was
raided by Customs officials, who carried
off the offending object. He has since got
it back and been given permission to give
away bits to customers who have their
hair cut provided he severs the sections
himself. The file of official minutes con-
nected with the outrage is said to contain
sufficient paper to supply local smokers
with enough gasper wrappings to last six
days.
Some of these Finns have very familiar
names, such as Ramsay and Tanner.
Tanner, the former Finance Minister, is
to be paid his salary while serving a
prison sentence (5y years) for “insfigat-
ing” the war against Russia. Tanner is
managing director of Elanto, a co-operat-
ive enterprise, and it has granted him
leave of absence, as he is “unable to per-
form his duties.” Finnish Leftist journals
are hitting the roof about this example
of bourgeois chicanery. The non-Com-
munist world is likely to remain passive.

“Pitt Street”: Down at Sydney’s Cir-
cular Quay men are busy on a variety of

pulling up tramlines, putting down tram-

near-by offices, who pour forth in the
lunch hour and stand in groups around
the manual workers, saying nothing,
merely watching. I’ve never fathomed
just what it is that attracts apparently
sensible men to watch their fellows throw-
ing earth about or digging holes, but it
will always attract a town audience any-
where in the world. Maybe it’s a com-
pound of envy and satisfaction —envy of
the office-bound male for the toiler in
the open and satisfaction that he hasn’t
got to do it, anyhow—but I can’t help
thinking it’s a silly way to pass the time,
what with parks and gardens and birds
and girls in the sun to watch and—
sorry, must cut this short. Just heard
they’re rooting up the waterside end of
King-street and want to go and have a
look at it.

“Leumeah”; There’s at least one other
N.S.W. example of foresight by early
settlers to add to that quoted by “Jimri”
(B. 19/6/’46). In Wingham, N.S.W.
North Coast, is a park of about 10 acres
of virgin jungle—called “scrub” by the
old-timers, to distinguish it from the
more open “forest” of the uplands. It
contains one tree, a fig, that has a
diameter of 10-12 feet at the base, while
the buttresses, which are such a feature
of this variety, cover a span of 40 yards.
The jungle has been preserved in its
natural state, undergrowth and all, and is
probably the only sample of that kind of
scrub extant anywhere along the coast.
Bird life is prolific and varied. I lately
renewed there acquaintance with birds,
including the dollar-bird and wonga
pigeon, that I hadn’t seen since I left the
coast over 30 years ago.

“Clooter”: Last Wednesday morn 1
arose in a gloomy mood, having spent the
evening listening to a broadcast of the
Federal Parliament and thereby having
my dreams haunted by the hopeless pic-
ture of a grand country and a grand
people so badly represented as to destroy
any hope for the future. The missus was
in no better case, since the gas was on
the blink, the baker had gone through
and there was no bread. What’s more
there wasn’t a cigarette in the house and
our matutinal cup o’ tea didn’t seem the
same without a gasper. All this, coupled
with two robust youths yodelling for their
breakfast and the certain knowledge that
I’d be late for work again, made me feel
like the bloke who lost a roll of notes
and recovered the rubber band. Brood-
ing on these things I opened the morn-
ing paper and there before my wondering
eyes was incredibly good news —there
was to be an increase of Is. a week in
the basic wage for all capitals save Brjs-
bane. “Wife,” I howled, “be cheerful,
lift a radiant face to the morn, for we
are to have another twelve pence. Think
of what it will buy, think of the orgy
of shopping you can” but her ex-
pression chilled me. “Gosh,” I gulped,
“I’m sorry. I was only trying to be
funny.” Then my helpmeet dropped to
a chair, put her face on her crossed arms
and wept. “Oh,” she sobbed, “how could
you! How could you be so joyful when
those poor Brisbane people are not to
enjoy this wonderful change in our for-
tunes?” After that the morning seemed
slightly better.

“Gravelsnatcher”: Those who thought
they knew him smiled knowingly when
“Spike” visited the church committee to
thank them for the Bible, sent to him
while a p.-0.-w. in Germany. But Ted,
who’d spent some months -in the same
prison camp, didn’t join in the general
hilarity. He ? d been with “Spike” when
the Bible arrived, and it was revealing to
see the gleam that came into those cold
eyes as he glanced quickly through the
once-familiar passages and fingered
lovingly the thin, almost transparent
sheets, for it was an expensive volume.
Ted recalled how “Spike,” after demon-
strating that each sheet was the equiva-
lent of eight cigarette papers—almost
non-procurable—carefully tore them out
and sold them for two cigarettes each,
religiously insisting on payment on the
“Here comes Pop with one of those prefabricated homes.”
spot. That Bible kept “Spike” in cigar-
ettes until his liberation. Yes, Ted knew
that every word “Spike” said to the
church members was uttered in a spirit
of heartfelt gratitude.

“Jasby”: When it comes to settling
down to civilian life after demobbing,
the youngster seems to be at a disadvan-
tage compared with older men. Four or
five years makes a jvhale of a difference
in a lad of 18 or 20; the niche he filled in
civil life no longer fits him, yet he is
often unfitted, temporarily, to fill a bigger
one. A man of 30 as a rule picks up
the threads of his old life more readily.
There are, of course, plenty of excep-
tions. I came across one the other day,
when I ran into a lad discharged six
months ago from my old unit. He’d had
four years of‘it and his father, an old
Digger from the earlier scrap, had joined
up for a second go when close on 50 and
had finished up in Borneo. “Rehabili-
tated yet?” I asked. “Oh, I’ve got back
to it all right,” he said, “but the old
man’s finding it pretty hard. Says he
found it easy enough last time, but this
time he just can’t settle down.”

“Melb’n”: According to a Red Cross
dietitian, although most Australians have
plenty to eat a high percentage suffers
from malnutrition, many of the victims
being children of well-to-do families. The
associations with which food is sur-
rounded play an enormous part in this.
A man was dining with a well-to-do
family whose larder contained just about
everything Nature provides in the way of
nourishment. Two children, aged five and
six, pushed away in succession the soup,
the fish, the entrde and the pudding, and
finally a harassed mother succeeded in get-
ting them to eat a slice of bread smothered
with jam and butter. An appeal to them
to drink their milk met with a refusal,
and then one of the infants got up and
poured both glasses into a saucer, spilling
most of the milk on to the carpet. An
overfed cat came up, sniffed the milk dis-
dainfully and went off to sleep in a
corner. The feelings of the guest, an ex-
p.-0.-w. from Changi and the Burma-
Siam railway, who came out weighing
five-stone, can be imagined,

“Gladesville”: Childhood impressions
influence us throughout life. At the age
of nine I was called out in class to recite
“The Wreck of the Hesperus.” I started
off with great gusto. “It was the schooner
Hesperus.” The teacher’s “Who said it
wasn’t?” followed by the guffaws of the
class, my own confusion and collapse
still haunt me. Later I was again called
on for an effort —this time “The Ancient
Mariner.” All went well till came “The
bloody sun at noon” —a hard clip on the
ear and “not so much emphasis on the
bloody” and a further collapse of the
elocutionist. I blame these incidents for
keeping me off the public platform. Per-
haps the teacher has done the world a
good turn, or maybe his sarcasm and
ridicule have robbed the nation of a«
Prime Minister or a union secretary.

“Captain Pintle”: Many an did masts-
and-yards sailorman will rejoice at the
prospect of four real windjammers
spreading their canvas to Australian
breezes once again. They are all Finnish
barques owned by Captain Erikson, of
Mariehamn, and all have been on the
Australian run in pre-war days. The
Pommern, Passat and Viking are due to
sail with timber ladings for Argentine
ports, coming on to Australia for return
cargoes. The American-built Moshulu
won the 1939 grain race against 13 other
sailers, and her passage of 91 days from
South Australia to England has only once
been beaten by a sailing vessel since 1921.
She was captured by the Germans at
Narvik, and is still undergoing refitting
as a result of their vandalistic stripping.
The last Erikson ship to visit Australian
waters was the Lawhill in June, 1943.
Three others were sunk by enemy action,
the Olivebank, Penang and Killoran.

“Sea Hawk”: To the residents of one
Brisbane suburb the termination of the

to keep the household cooking require-

“Simon Scrawler”: In a prison camp in
Siam an R.A.A.F. sergeant was ordered
to make a “bang-bang yasume.” He
reasoned thus, “yasume” means “rest!”
or “stand-easy 1 ” Therefore “bang-bang
yasume” must mean “air-raid shelter.”
A screaming Korean soon convinced him
he was wrong. “Bang-bang yasume!
0.K.! Boom-boom yasume! Nay! ”
howled the guard. “He wants a rifle-rest,
sarge,” a Digger interpreted. In the amaz-
ing lingua franca of the p.-0.-w, camps
“bang-bang” meant shooting, whereas
“boom-boom” meant bombing. A fine
shade of meaning.

“F.S.”: The discovery by an interior
decorator of a painting described as
Rubens’s original “Descent from the
Cross” in a dustbin at the Boston Art
Club doesn’t surprise me. The club owed,
the discoyerer 52 dollars, and he offered
to cancel the debt and give another 40
dollars if allowed to keep the picture. It
hung over his fireplace until he heard
over the radio about a suit for 100,000
dollars’ damages filed against Harvard
University for loss of the picture. One
of Australia’s leading anthropologists
spent several months during the war at
Cambridge doing research work. He
spent his leisure looking around the town
for old furniture and found that for a
song he could buy incredible quantities of
the loveliest pieces ; he found much of it
in backyards and on dealers’ scrapheaps.
The collection he brought out would
grace any gallery or museum in U.S. or
Europe.

“Bernard Hackshaw”: Opening an art
exhibition in Melbourne the other day
Professor Bernard Heinze said that since
the war there has been an awakening of
an entirely new consciousness in art, and
whereas 21 years ago only 64 sub-
scribers witnessed a “celebrity” concert
in Melbourne today a similar concert
would draw 9000 people. These are im-
pressive figures, but I can’t help wonder-
ing how much it indicates of a wider
spread of musical knowledge. A young
woman who has been attending the pro-
fessor’s concerts for years was introduced
to an eminent visiting pianist at a party.
“Oh, Mr. Hammerclavier,” she gushed,
“I would just love to hear you play.
Couldn’t you play us the so-and-so con-
certo?” “I could if you got me an
orchestra,” retorted the virtuoso grimly.

“Looby”: At least one smoker has been
cured of using home-made cigarette-
papers (B. 10/7/’46). I met a friend
who’d been away from work for a week.
“What’s the trouble?” I asked, and this
was the reply: “First thing the doctor said
when I told him my stomach was out
of order was: ‘Have you been smoking
with toilet-paper?’ I told him I had, and
he said he was getting a bit tired of
such cases. He then referred to a
chemical used to produce the absor-
bent quality of toilet-paper which upsets
tummies. He reckoned the safest and
best substitute is thin typing paper. It
has to be done over with white of egg
first. But I’ve given smoking up in dis-
gust.”
“Dekko”; Don’t smoke toilet-paper (B.
10/7/’46). Strip the outer husk from a
corncob and detach the thin inner sheaths.
Cut to suitable size they roll naturally
and stay put when held between the
fingers. If the material has become
brittle, soak in water for a few minutes
and dry before cuttings Decades ago I
bought South American cigarettes made
in this fashion and secured by a strand of

“Jack Point”: As an ex-chookfarmer
I gave vent to one derisive snort on
reading of “Ike Hollar’s” woman who
hatched thousands of eggs by taking them
to bed with her. The normal human
temperature is 98.4 deg. F.; the tempera-
ture of a broody hen is between 104 and
105. In a bed, eggs in actual contact with
the human body might attain a tem-
perature approaching 98; those a few
inches away would probably register 90
or less. Though embryonic develop-
ment may start at a much lower tempera-
ture than 90, it is an utter impossibility
to hatch a chick unless for the greater
part of the three weeks it is maintained
at between 103 and 105. In the days
of not-so-reliable incubators, I spoiled
many a precious batch of eggs through
a faulty thermometer registering one to
two degrees out. And to think that I
could have become rich if I had only
known about bed-hatching!

“Qwert Yuiop”: It is just 100 years
ago since Elias Howe invented the first
successful lock-stitch sewing machine and
thereby revolutionised the whole business
of clothing manufacture, domestic and in-
dustrial alike. It was not until well into
the 1860’s that the first Howe machines
came to Australia, and they were at first
regarded with strong suspicion by the
industrious housewives of those decora-
tive crinoline days. They were even
preached against as satanic agencies bent
on creating mischief for idle female
hands to do. One of my earliest impres-
sions regarding the queerness of grown-
ups arose from the maledictions of a
great-aunt against the clumsiness and
stupid design of the dratted things. Only
in later years did I realise that her dislike
of them arose from her being lefcbandaL
HITLER’S YACHT.
“Hitler’s 2500-ton luxury yacht, with the ornate

With- a cultured taste in curios,

Of things they’d tell us on Hitler’s yacht.

And how it finished is hard to say,
But he skied the wipe when his course was run
And Musso’s end was a stickier one.

But to point a moral and deck a tale
Of the bootless plan and the fruitless plot
By would-be Caesars on Hitler’s yacht.

All round the world for a raree show
Where one may view, for a shilling or so,

Where the world’s twin scourges in conclave

“Findy”: When signing the British
Loan Bill President Truman is reported
to have used 26 pens. At first glance this
might be thought to be a reflection on the
inferior quality of post-war nibs, but
actually it was intentional, the pens being
afterwards handed to British and Ameri-
can notabilities as souvenirs of the occa-
sion. General MacArthur seems to have
started this sort of thing. At the Japan-
ese surrender ceremony on board U.S.S.
Missouri, he used three pens, handing one
each to Generals Percival and Wain-
wright and pocketing the third himself.
As far as can be ascertained, King John
used only one pen to scrawl his mark on
Magna Charta, and the same economy of
stationery was observed when the Habeas
Corpus Act and the Bill of Rights re-
ceived the Royal Assent. Fifty-six men
signed the Declaration of Independence,
but it is not recorded yvhether they all
used the same quill. The practice of
using a battery of pens probably satisfies
the American craze for souvenirs, but it
rather cheapens the items. I can’t see
much satisfaction in the ownership of one
of the 24 trowels used in the laying of a
foundation-stone, one of the 35 pairs
of scissors used to cut the ribbon at the
opening of a bridge, one of the four
dozen champagne bottles used at the
launching of a battleship or one of the
57 varieties of canned goods used at a

“Jacob”: Are the attendance figures of
sporting fixtures calculated in the same
way as Moscow correspondents worked
out German casualties? My afternoon
paper put the attendance at the Brisbane
Rugby League “Test” at 65,000 plus a
few thousand gate-crashers ; the A.B.C.
news gave it as 50,000; the Queens-
land news three minutes later raised the
figure to 60,000. This was followed, on
the front page of the Sunday press, by
55,000, which dwindled to 45,000 on the
back page of the same issue. Does any-
one know the real figures or do news
services just do a little guesswork?

“Zake”: One of the chaps at the party
was telling of a soldier on overseas service
who was desperately ill and, what worried
the doctors most, didn’t seem disposed
to put up a fight for life. But he kept
calling a name. So they wirelessed the
army at home to get a gramophone record
of his wife’s voice. It was flown back
and immediately the soldier began to
recover. The story brought tears to Aunt
Martha’s eyes. “Dear me!” she said
sentimentally. “To think that his loved
one’s voice coming from thousands of
miles away like that could pull him back
from the grave! It encouraged him to
live.” “Sort of. Aunt,” said the teller of
the story drily. “I heard the record.
The voice was like a file going over sheet-
iron and it started off with ‘What’s all
this nonsense about you not wanting to
get better, Harry? You just listen to me
now’ Henry got better, all right—
the poor cow was afraid to die!”

“Bo”: “Temperament” a polite
euphemism for boorishness —was once

singers, especially of opera. Whether or
not divas still indulge in pre-curtain tan-
trums we wouldn’t know, opera in Aus-
tralia being but a dim memory. But
“temperament” has certainly been adopted
by “sportsmen” to such a degree that it
now seems to be regarded as part of the
game. Let a linesman call an “out”
when a ball has lifted the chalk and the
tennis player, his head turned by press
adulation, will petulantly hurl down his
racket, glare malevolently at the official
or slam the next ball savagely into the
crowd. Let the big tournament golfer
about to sink a putt be “disturbed” by
someone in the gallery blowing his nose
and he will rush over to the offender and
want to have him on. Well, the other

baritone Todd Duncan was singing the
Prologue to “Pagliacci.” At the close
of the fine andante , and before the short
final phase, there is a dramatic pause, and
into this the majority of the audience
rushed with the usual burst of ill-timed
applause. The baritone stepped forward,
held up both hands traffic-cop fashion,
smiled and finished the aria off magnifi-
cently. Had he been reared in big golf
or tennis circles he would have hurled
the grand piano into “A” row, kicked his
pianist after it, rushed out into the Green

“Exkewex”: The army habit of making
chefs into pioneers, clerks into cooks and
navvies into orderly-room blokes was
probably old in King Alfred’s time, but
the uninitiated might have thought that
hospital orderlies would have been chosen
with some regard to previous experience.
In an isolation camp a dozen of us were
in the care of a blacksmith’s striker. He
had to take our temperatures night and
morning, and his method was to give us
a thermometer each and then disappear
for half an hour. We found out that
water from the waterbag would put the
“thermo” down to its low level and a
little hot water from the kitchen would
push it up to top. On our last morning
there, about half of us put our instru-
ments each way, handed them back to
“Pills” and waited for comments. That
part of the joke fell flat—“ Pills” calmly
entered half of us as having temps, of
about 92 and the remainder as being
around the 112 degree mark. We heard
later that the staff learnt some brand-new
language when the M.O. paraded “Pills,”

wearing suits that must have cost him

He drove to work in a swanky sports car,

expensive-looking beauties. He began
placing large bets with the office s.-p.
bookie and displayed other signs of afflu-
ence. The boss, suspicious of this sudden
prosperity, called in the auditors, who re-
ported that Clagwag was not chiselling
the firm. Then it leaked out that he
had shared a large lottery prize
and was merely spending his own
money. Indignant, the boss sent for him.
“Mr. Clagwag,” he stormed. “Fm dis-
tressed that you should have shown so
little concern for the firm as not to in-
form us of your good luck. Had you
done so 1 would have been spared the

knocked back. Later that day the chief

chuckling. “Beerpump’s a beaut,”
he said. “He didn’t earn a bob
from us this week and he was refused an
advance. Do you know what he did?”
“No,” answered the editor indifferently.
“Well,” continued the chief sub, “he wrote
his own obituary—a thousand words. I
paid him two guineas for it, and I’m
putting it in the ‘morgue.’ ” The editor
looked up wearily. “That was damn’
silly of you,” he said. “He’s probably

it wrong. Tear it up and regard the pay-

“Lord Luvus”: How much horse Vic-
torians have been eating without knowing
is difficult to compute. The fact that
several-roomfuls of neddie’s brisket were
found at a house at Werribee not long
ago suggests that it is more than most
citizens would care to consider. Why not
legalise the practice and have shops which
advertise horseflesh for humans as well
as for the lower carnivores? A Mel-
bourne artist who spent some years in
Paris believes that he ate far more horse-
flesh than beef during the first months
of his sojourn. Having very little money
he frequented the cheaper cafes, but
when he discovered that horse was quite
a respectable ingredient of Paris diet he
moved up to the more expensive cafds.
Now that he can feel more calmly about
it, he has come to the conclusion that the
food he ate at the cheaper cafes was
just as tasty and evidently as healthy
as at the more expensive.

they are once more being “trailed” by
the Guardsmen disporting themselves in

“NX65381”: My only encounter with

army. As I was making my way
along one of the back canyons of
Surry Hills (Sydney) one night a
trio of hefty young louts materialised
from the shadows and blocked my

the leader of the “push.” I decided to
talk fast in a desperate attempt to save
myself and roll. “Matches?” I cried.
“Gripes! I ’aven’t a blanky thing—

commented the leader. “My crimson oath

down somewhere?” “Yairs, mate,” I re-
plied. “And 1 don’t suppose you can
give a bloke a smoke?” I was handed
a shilling and a tailor-made, and in my
relief I almost used my own matches to
light the cigarette. As I moved off I
heard one of the push say “Gripes!
Nigger and Spike must ’a’ been in thaf.
Won’t they laugh when we tell ’em?”
A CHANCE FOR LASKI.
You need, it’s clear as clear can be,
My amiable Chifley,
Some outside help from oversea
To keep your tail up stiffly.
You feel as Aulus must have felt,
Although he’d downed Tarquinius,
When bidding Caius Cossus pelt
His hardest for Herminius.
Since Attlee may not prove the card
On which you were relying,
Because he’s higher jobs to guard
And bigger fish for frying
In Europe and in Palestine,
Would it not be, I ask ’ee,
A bright idea to drop a line,
An urgent note, to Laski? _
From Lynn to Milford Bay men own,
Since Labor’s star has risen
The real power behind the throne
In Cockney phrase is his’n.
Who made, for other hands to loose.
The verbal missiles needed
To cook illustrious Churchill’s goose?
The obvious answer’s “He did.”
He pulls the strings. Big Business can
Have no more fierce aggressor
And savage castigator than
This erudite professor.
His stock-in-trade of rare and rich
Vituperative frenzies
Should surely help you queer the pitch
Of Fadden and of Menzies.
To boost your sagging Labor stocks
With pre-election vigor
It’s plain you need some clarion vox,
Some dominating figure.
Clem Attlee might have served you fine,'
But for the pressing task he
Unfortunately must decline,
How would it be to send a line,
A hurry call, to Laski?

Hero and Mate.
King George does not forget the valor-
ous men who have fought and suffered
in the Empire’s service. His Majesty
has sent a message of sympathy to the
widow of Sergeant W. E. Brown, V.C.,
D.C.M., who refused to surrender to the
victorious enemy at Singapore, being
last seen going forward, laden with
grenades, to fight it out. The gracious
expression of pity and pride was
recorded by A.B.C. It was ignored by
Sydney papers which give acres of space
to the glorification of bookmakers,
dinner-dance-joint proprietors, publicans
and boot and clothing manufacturers in
the racing game and the rest of the
strange new aristocracy, as well as to the
“heroes” of “sport,” squealers and all.
The Bulletin continues to receive
letters from old mates of “The Sergeant
“Taurus in conjunction with Full Moon! No time to be buying a
lottery ticket, Prendergast!”
of the Eighth,” all testifying not only to
his quality as a soldier but to his worth as
a man. One comes from O. N, Mc-
Lardy, of Mackay (N.Q.), proprietor of
“Mac’s Shoe Store”:
From the time Wally Brown joined the old
20th Battalion I was a cobber of his, and
from the time I heard he was missing in
Malaya I had been trying to obtain informa-
tion as to how he fared in that campaign. I
should like to relate an incident of Wally’s
career in the 20th.
In August, 1917, a private then, he joined
it with Private Hughes in the St. Omer area,
where we were preparing for the heavy fight-
ing around Passchendaele in September and
October. Brown and Hughes were insepar-
able cobbers. Wally did sonie great work
during those stunts, but Hughes was killed in
action.
Our unit was in the line until the end of
January, 1918, when we were relieved, re-
turning to the St. Omer area to spell and
reorganise. It we& at this stage that Wally
was awarded the D.C.M. and granted Blighty
leave; but he had other ideas. He obtained
permission from the C.O. to return to the field
of Passchendaele and search for Hughes’s
grave. Prior to going he fashioned a beautiful
cross with his own hands, and this he took
with him. Successful in his search, he erected
the cross on the grave. Later he became
platoon sergeant, and as such he endeared
himself to all the boys. Himself a non-smoker
and a teetotaller, he always managed to have
plenty of cigs. and S.R.D. for them.
Vale, Wally, good cobber and One of
nature’s gentlemen! I enclose a letter I re-
ceived from him after he enlisted for the
war against Japan. Naturally, I should like to
get it back.
It is a pencilled letter written from
Wagga (N.S.W.) on June 7, 1940, to
“Dear old pal Os”:
I was surprised and very delighted to re-
ceive your letter a couple of days back, and
it was good of you to write me. Fancy you
picking my name out from “Smith’s”! They
have broadcast it all over Australia and I am
getting letters from different folk.
When I made up my mind to enlist I
filled in my papers as having no military ex-
perience, and as I thought tried to slip in
without anyone knowing. The country president
of the League is manpower officer at Wagga,
and he got down on me, but let me pass the
medical men first before spilling the beans.
Then at the camp I was soon picked out
and then the papers got hold of it.
Yes, Os, I could not resist the temptation
of enlisting again when I saw the boys and
many old Diggers going away. And, although
I have a wife and two lovely kiddies to think
about I came t® the conclusion that my duty
was to serve my country and family both, so
here I am waiting the army’s pleasure.
Anyhow this camp is 100 per cent, better
than last time. The food and conditions are
Al, and they do all that is possible to make
everyone comfortable. Of course the drill
movements are somewhat different, more
simple in fact.
Fancy, Os, the last time I saw you was
at one of the Anzac marches. I have been
living on the Leeton Irrigation Area for over
10 years now.
By the way my brother lives at Mackay. I
don’t know if you ever ran across him or not.
He is Capt. Charles Brown, and has some-
thing to do with the Adelaide Steamship
Company. I am pleased to know that you
have been in business for some time. I don’t
know that you are wise trying to dispose of
your business to enlist; still you know best.
I was down at the 20th’s reunion about
three years ago. Claude Cameron and Tom
Holman run it now. Quite a number of the
boys have passed on over the last few years.
Well, Ossie, old pal, for this time enough.
Please excuse the pencil, but have no conveni-
ences here yet.
Shall always be pleased to get a line from
you.
A big cheerio, old boy, with very best wishes
to yourself and family.
Remaining as always,
Your old pal,
,Wal.
Unhappily, only one of the “two lovely
kiddies,” a girl, remains with her mother.
The boy died when his father’s fate was
unknown.
The Restless Bear.
“Ek Dum”: From various signs and
‘portents all is far from well with Russia.
Our own Colonel Jackson, who is
second-in-command of U.N.R.R.A., has
given a ghastly picture of conditions in
the Ukraine, where a great part of the
population is living in holes in the
ground. And the report of the Canadian
royal commission, which established, not
merely that there was a military espion-
age system in Canada organised from
Moscow, but that there was, also, a
thoroughly complete scheme (including a
wide secret-police network), based on the
organs of the local Communist party,
for perverting the loyalty of Canadian
youth and educating them in the duplicity
which is a feature of Communist doctrine,
left a nasty taste in all American mouths.
Moscow has had little to say about the
Canadian matter. It has had a great deal
to say about the unfortunate Mihailovich,
who was executed during the week, and
even more to say about the “dastard anti-
Soviet traitors”—British officers who
allegedly spent most of their time in
Yugoslavia, where they were posted at the
risk of their lives, begging Mihailovich to
fight the Communists and thus aid Ger-
many, against which Britain was fighting
for existence.
There also have been a hostile and
sullen tone towards the American loan
to Britain (a “request” for a greater loan
to Russia has been refused), a continual
sneering at Mr, Bevin and a repetition
of cracks at General MacArthui_and^u^

Many people imagine that Fate has deprived them of the
good things of life — success, popularity, radiant health,
the fulfilment of their cherished hopes and dreams. But
if they only knew it frustration and disappointment come
from within, from negative forces and influences deep within
the Subconscious Mind, and until these forces are eradicated
they can have little hope of happiness or" achievement.

methods —incidentally a pastime indulged
in over a “national” station by the Aus-
tralian Professor Stone, Australian since
1942.
Generally it is hard to believe that it is
only two or three years since the life of
the U.S.S.R. was saved by Anglo-
American co-operation, Britain is being
attacked in the same tone in which Ger-
many was attacked before August, 1939
—when a complete change occurred.
References to British rule in India are in
exactly the same strain as references of
yore to Goebbels’s acts of terrorism. India
is painted as a land of bloody pogroms,
kept in subjection by the machine-gun and
the lash of British soldiery; Malaya and
Burma something similar.
In Central Europe a series of border
wars seems to be in progress. No
person dares to step a yard over
the boundary of the Russian zone.
The Americans had great difficulty
in recovering a non-commissioned
officer (in uniform) and his wife
who accidentally found themselves in
Russian-controlled territory in Berlin
during a holiday jaunt.
And two other officers (also in uniform)
were being held as hostages for four
Russian officers who were caught in
civilian clothes and without papers in the
U.S. zone.
Following the Canadian exposure,
Ankara began to report great military
activity in the Dardanelles zone on the
Russian-controlled side of the border.
Simultaneously, in the usual vague
manner, it was allowed to leak out of
Moscow that something was wrong in the
Russian military world and that transfers
of generals were in progress.
One transfer (unexplained) was that of
Zhukov, Russia’s leading commander, to
Odessa. Odessa in ordinary times is a
second- or third-rate base. In the event
of war with Turkey it would be Russia’s
primary base for operations from the
Balkans. But it may be that Zhukov has
been too active in the mortal struggle for
the succession to Stalin, now seldom
heard of.
"The Green Hornets."
“Ek Dum”: Hot from the press is a
curious-looking but ornate volume called
The Green Hornets: The Story of the
Seventh Battalion Volunteer Defence
Corps. It is decorated with abundant
caricatures, and the verse and the general
atmosphere of the book prove that its
subjects were anything but green. Bert
Pike’s picture of a hornet on the front
cover is enough to frighten any Jap, even
after he had swallowed a bucket of sake.
The Seventh Battalion (C.O. the well-
beloved Lieut.-Colonel N. F. Bremner,
D. 5.0.), was the pioneer unit of the
V.D.C.
After a long struggle with the
Government, the R.S.L. decided to form
a Home Guard on May 31, 1940. The
Government approved five days later. By
June 18, North Sydney had enrolled the
first 100 members of the Seventh Bat-
talion, forerunner of a force which in
a fortnight grew to 10,000 Diggers of
World War I, under command of Major-
General Gordon Bennett, C. 8., C.M.G.,
D. 5.0., V.D.
By July 4, 1940, the Seventh Battalion
had a complete complement of officers,
the first administrative memo, of the
“R.S.L. Volunteer Defence Corps” having
been issued on June 21. Training started
in what was then “17th Battalion area”
on July 9, in sub-units from the North
Sydney, Mosman, Manly, Deewhy-Narra-
been areas, the rendezvous being French’s
Forest Showground.
In the early stages there was great en-
thusiasm to make up for an even greater
shortage of offensive weapons —“rifles
were loaned by the cadets of ‘Shore’
school.” Battalion parades were held at
intervals, the picnic atmosphere gradu-
ally disappearing as the troops were
moulded into their old World War I
form.
On November 17, 1940, the corps was
reviewed at large by Lord Gowrie, V.C.,
at Centennial Park, Sydney. Small boys
stood on the sidelines and roughs in those
days (little realising that they themselves
would be shoved into uniform within two
or three months) were apt to laugh at the
zeal of the Old Guard.
However, the intensification of war
abroad and the acquirement of arms soon
changed the atmosphere. By July, 1941,
the 17th Battalion area had become the
habitat of the Seventh Battalion, and
Lieut.-Colonel Travers, D. 5.0., had
handed over command to Lieut.-Colonel
Bremner. Uniforms, arms and equipment
of a sort had materialised from some-
where. A continuous guard was provided
at certain vulnerable points on a roster
basis. Frequently the Hornets emerged in
their familiar green uniform, though with-
out the dragon-fly wings which the breed
seems to have grown in Bert Pike’s re-
markable illustrations of their prowess.
It was not till March, 1942, that the
battalion, like the rest of the V.D.C., be-
came an official body and its members
were attested and absorbed into the
routine organisation of the Army for
what looked like a desperate defence of
Australia directly ahead —it was officially
believed at that time that invasion was
imminent.
Coast Defence
Just before the corps celebrated its
third anniversary, appeals began to be
made for recruits to man anti-aircraft,
searchlight and coastal artillery installa-
tions, thus releasing A.M.F. personnel.
The necessary complement of batteries
and posts was not obtainable by the
volunteer method. So, during the latter
part of 1942, Seventh Battalion personnel
were posted in strength to coast-defence
and ack-ack batteries in the Sydney area.
They underwent painstaking and onerous
training, which was a considerable strain
on men who were involved as well in the
duties of civil life, at that time unusually
exacting because of manpower and other
shortages; but they quickly showed the
value of last-war experiences.
Men who had been footsloggers in the
long ago knuckled down with a will to
the job of becoming gunners and became
the core of the defence of a large part
of the Sydney area. At a crucial stage
they were reinforced by elements of the
Bth, 9th, 10th and 11th Battalions.
It was not till December, 1943, that
full army rates of pay were awarded to
members, who hitherto had gloried in the
fact that they were a purely honorary
body, producing not only the cost of its
maintenance but a surplus, which was
handed over to charities within its area.
The Volunteers
There was a continual passage of mem-
bers in and out of the force. Consider-
ing the “advanced” ages and personal
responsibilities of the men of the unit it
was something of a feat to contribute six
volunteers to the R.A.N., 23 to the A.I.F.
and 43 to the R.A.A.F.
The Green Hornets is the epitome of
almost everything that happened to the
Seventh Battalion, and of a lot of things
that didn’t happen to it. It is a model of
what a book of the sort should be —well-
written and printed, with plenty of the
kind of soldiers’ verse which sounds as
of it had been written by Walt Whitman
in collaboration with “Bellerive,” and
with endless portraits by Frith (a distin-
guished member who himself is immor-
talised by Ted Scorfield) and Bert Pike, to
whose enthusiasm much of the success of
The Green Hornets is due.
The Bulletin has a special affection for
the Seventh Battalion V.D.C., since it
was the unit of its homefire soldiers. One
was its managing director, former O.C.
of the 51st Battery in World War I.
According to a very positive member of
the Senate and of the whole Communist
party during the crucial days of the Jap
invasion period of 1942 (when his four
children were on service), the m.d. was
operating a secret Japanese wireless set
within three-quarters of a mile of Garden
Island. The Senator—a Mr. Lamp, from
Tasmania had positive information
about the matter, though not in posses-
sion of all the detector posts round
Sydney Harbor, and had handed it to the
Attorney-General.
The Green Hornets, apart from its
copious illustrations, contains a full
muster roll of the battalion, which, in the
end, was as fine and steady a force as
it was possible for the Japs to meet —a
formidable aggregation of human
material, immeasurably stronger as a
fighting unit than the inexperienced lads
whom the “Government” sent to guard
Rabaul and other vital spots in the far
North at the outbreak of the Japanese
war.
When the E. and A. liner Tanda was
torpedoed between Colombo and Bombay
two years ago three radio operators, al-
though ordered to abandon ship, stayed
aboard. R. C, V. Humphery, W. H.
Harris and C. K. Begdon repaired the
transmitter and sent an SOS a few seconds
before the bridge was awash, and a ship
of the Royal Indian Navy picked up the
survivors five hours later. But no more
has been heard of the heroes. English-
born, Humphery had his first taste of
soldiering in “The Buffs.” During World
War I he was with the A.1.F., and was
wounded early in the piece. A signals
officer in the Militia from 1933 he rose
during World War II to the rank of
lieut.-col., and was O.C. of the Army
School of Signals at Casula (N.S.W.).
Transferred to reserve he joined the
Tanda as wireless operator. He was
one of the top technicians of A.W.A. and
his Concise Radio Handbook commanded
large sales. On behalf of The Bulletin
he answered thousands of technical ques-
tions in the Service page. He was a quiet
fellow of rare personal charm. Those
who knew him were looking forward to
renewing their friendship with him and
will miss him greatly.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Melbourne University’s first Professor
of Psychology, Wing-Commander O. A,
Oeser, just released from his job of ex-
ploring the mental hinterlands of Ger-
mans required for high administrative
posts under the British Military Govern-
ment, already has connections with the
southern city. He has two children there
and his wife is a lecturer in psychology
at the university. The black-moustached
young man is a Cambridge graduate who
has covered many subjects, physics,
astronomy, mathematics, experimental
color vision and social and psychological
research among them, while lecturing in
South Africa and as head of the Psy-
chology School at St. Andrew’s Univer-
sity. He was on research in the U.S.
when he was recalled to a secret appoint-
ment on the British Air Staff during the
late war. It was he who organised the
scheme and trained the staff for sorting
out democratically-minded Germans from
the Nazis.
Allan S. Lloyd, latest addition to the
ranks of Sydney K.Cs., has doubled legal
and Army careers for quite a long time.
He served with the old 34th Battalion in
the First World War and after that he
became Legal Staff Officer with the First
Militia Division, serving with this and
other formations until 1942, when he be-
came Deputy Judge Advocate-General,
Land H.Q. A year later he was given
the job of organising the Australian Army
Legal Corps, becoming its first director.
In this capacity he was largely respon-
sible for framing and interpreting regu-
lations under the War Crimes Act.
Canadian pianist Ross Pratt (depicted
here by Dubois), who is touring Australia
PIANIST.
under engagement to A.8.C., has played
for the troops in Hong Kong, Burma,
Malaya and Java, Born at Winnipeg, he
won his first musical prize at 11 ; adjudi-
cator, Edgar Bainton. In 1935 he went
to London on a scholarship to con-
tinue his studies with Harold Craxton,
and at 19 was soloist with the
8.8. C. Symphony Orchestra under Sir
Henry Wood. His London recital debut
was made in Wigmore Hall in 1939, and
his first United States public appearance
followed two years later. In the same
week he gave a recital at the New York
Town Hall and included in his pro-
gramme a sonata by Australian-born
composer Howard Ferguson. Ross Pratt
went to Mexico last year as the first of
a succession of artists on exchange be-
tween Canada and Mexico. While there
he found some old Spanish music by
Padre Soler, a pupil of Scarlatti' and will
introduce two of Soler’s sonatas in his
Australian recitals. In Guadalajara, the
second city of Mexico, he met Australian
musician Leslie Hodge, conductor of the
local symphony orchestra.
Many ex-p.-0.-w. have warm recol-
lections of Dr. Richard Thomas Benfield
Green, an Australian doctor who recently
turned up in London. Dr, Green was in
Singapore during the Japanese occupation
and spent 22 months as a captive.
During all that time, and before it, he
experimented with vaccines, making anti-
diphtheric vaccine from the unorthodox
goat until he was able to organise the
mass inoculation of half a million people
on the island as well as hordes of others
in South-east Asia. Using seaweed as a
jelly culture, he produced vaccines which
practically eliminated cholera, typhoid
and smallpox from areas where they had
been endemic for generations even in
peace-time. He was in the Colonial
Medical Service in Malaya for 20 years
and intends to return there.
An excellent documentary film of the
Australian wool industry, “A Lamb for
Mary,” is peopled with characters who
might have stepped straight from The
Bulletin’s Aboriginalities pages, but
there’s an international flavor in the
names of the men who did the job.
Canadian Alec Cann, director and com-
mentator, started the war as a gunnery
officer with the Canadian Navy in the
Atlantic and finished up as a war corres-
pondent in the Pacific, where he turned
out a string of fine documentary war
films for the N.E.I. Government. Java
was his last assignment in the islands,
after which he took a spell rolling around
N. S. Wales with “Mac” Falkiner, of
Widgiewa, and conceived the idea of “A
Lamb for Mary.” Pastoralist G. B. S.
Falkiner, of Haddon Rig, backed it
and .left the film-men to it. Edi-
ting and musical arrangement went
to “Doc” Sternberg, who had met and
worked with Cann on the N.E.I. film out-
fit. Sternberg was in the film-game in
Germany, Switzerland, France and Eng-
land before coming to Australia —editing
Cinesound’s “Orphan of the Wilderness”
to get it past the British censors was his
first introduction to these parts —bringing
with him a Continental approach to film
production, plus a conviction that good
Australian films will have to be
based mainly on good Australian books
and good Australian plays. Photographer
Carl Kayser is an old associate of Stern-
berg—they met and worked together on
the fine English documentary “Edge of
the World” —and photographed “The
Overlanders” before “A Lamb for Mary.”
“Becks” farewells an old lady:
So Australia is to see the last of the
Katoomba! She’s over 30, which is quite
aged for a liner —Federal Government con-
siders they should all be pensioned otf at 25
—but the work she has done in the last six
years would have done credit to a skittish
young vessel fresh otf the stocks. Built in
1913 by Harland and Wolff of Belfast she
carried Mciiwraith’s houseflag and thousands
of passengers between Sydney and Fremantle
before she was requisitioned for duty in the
Kaiser’s War —first as a trooper and later as
hospital ship. Painted white with a large
Red Cross on each side she was the first
vessel to pass through the Dardanelles after
the Turkish surrender. By 1920 she was back
on the coast and was the crack ship on the
Western run in the early ’twenties. 1 recall
dancing on her gaily decorated deck on New
Year’s Eve, 1924, when, ablaze with light and
with a crowded passenger list, she steamed
along somewhere in the middle of the Great
Australian Bight. Captain Moodie-Heddla
was her skipper then, as for many years be-
fore and after. Commodore of the line he
was a jovial and popular figure on the Aus-
tralian coast. On New Year’s Eve, 1942, I
swung in a hammock above the same deck.
Katoomba was a full ship again—lloo troops
slept in the hammocks, cabins and holds as,
blacked-out and in murky war dress, she
nosed her way north to New Guinea. Twice
after that she was again my temporary home;
the last time her “full” list was further dis-
tended by the provision of tiers of bunks in
the holds and 1450 of us managed to squeeze
in—but no one minded the crush as the war
was over and we were on our way home for
discharge. Since then the old lady has been in
lots of trouble. We ran into a strike in
Townsville and another in Brisbane. Not
long after that, loaded up with returning
Maorilanders, she came under a black ban in
Sydney —she was the subject of a Norman
'Lindsay cartoon on that occasion. Now, sold
to the Greeks and flying—save the mark! —
the Panamanian flag, she leaves these parts for
good—unions permitting. Under other skies
she will know a few more years of useful
service; manned by alien crews she will ply
between ports half a world away from these
shores, but the old lady will long have a place
in the affectionate memory of tens of thous-
ands of Australians who travelled in her in
peace and in war.
Ralph Abercrombie, Commonwealth
Auditor-General since 1938, gave up his
duties as watchdog over public moneys last
week. He had been in the Federal service
since 1911, coming from the Victorian
Treasury, A.-Gs. have the unpleasant job
of telling Ministers when they consider
money has been spent unconstitutionally
or debited without proper Parliamentary
sanction. In his 1944-45 report Aber-
crombie drew attention to Referendum
expenses which had been charged up to
Post-war Education. Cal well maintained
that the sums “had been drawn under
appropriation made by law,” but the A.-G.
stuck to his guns and reported that he
was unable to accept that sufficient Parlia-
mentary authority existed for the charge.
Retiring at 65, Abercrombie is succeeded
by Joyce of the Commonwealth Treasury.
After doing the rounds of the P.M.G.’s,
Defence and Treasury, Joyce returns to
the department to which he was first
posted when he joined the Commonwealth
Public Service in 1903.
Scotch Colleges in Australia look to
Maoriland for maisters to teach their
young callants. In emulation of the
Scotch Colleges at Melbourne, Sydney,
and Warwick (Q.), Scotch College, Perth,
has appointed G. M. Keys as its principal.
A native of Christchurch, he was edu-
cated at Palmerston North High School
and Canterbury University College, where
he graduated M.A. with honors in 1926.
He put in four years at Cathedral
Grammar School, Christchurch, as assis-
tant master and 15 at Christchurch
Tech,
Awarded the honorary degree of Doctor
of Science by the University of Cam-
bridge, Dr. Frank Macfarlane Burnet,
F.R.S., Director and chief research
worker at the Walter and Eliza Hall In-
stitute in Melbourne, has spent years look-
ing through little windows in egg-shells
at germinating microbes in the hopes of
discovering Ihe genesis of the common
cold and its numerous relations. He car-
ried this investigation so far that during
the late war he was given facilities for
immunising large numbers of Australian
soldiers. His work is followed in all parts
of the world where tWb or three medical
scientists are gathered together and, being
a patient worker himself, he is one of
the chief debunkers of the miraculous
claims for medical marvels which come
out almost every week, mainly from
Russia. Born at Traralgon (Vic.) and
educated at Geelong College and the
University of Melbourne, he was Beit
scholar at the Lister Institute in London
in 1927.
Back in his homeland to conduct a
series of debates and lectures on behalf
of the Air League of the British Empire,
Air-Commodore W. J. Y. Guilfoyle,
0.8. E., M.C., R.A.F., drawn here by
Mcßeath, resembles John Monash faci-
ally and in another characteristic —
that of foreseeing military tenden-
cies ahead of others. While in Ger-
many in 1931 as guest of the Berlin Aero
Club, Guilfoyle noted many things
which to him clearly predicted Germany's
intentions and wasn’t slow in telling the
authorities about them when he got back.
He enlisted in the 4th Light Horse in 1914,
transferred to the R.F.A, in time to be at
the Landing, later switched to the R.F.C.,
and was lent to the - Navy as a night-
flying pilot to defend London against the
AIRMAN.
Zepps. A spin to earth from 10,000 feet
brought serious injuries, after whicg
he slipped over to Suez in time to be the
first member of the No. 67 (Aust.) Squad-
ron to win the M.C. In 1918 he was com-
manding the 28th Fighter Squadron on
the Austro-Italian frontier, where he lost
the sight of his right eye. In World War
II he commanded No. 38 Group, which
controlled London’s balloon barrage
throughout the most critical period of that
city’s history. He is a son of the Guilfoyle
who, between 1873 and 1909, made the
Melbourne Botanical Gardens one of the
world’s loveliest pleasances.
William Edward Field, new managing-
director of Caltex Oil, was born in Red-
ditch, England,
started his career
with a Birmingham
firm of engineers,
went to Maoriland in
1911, and crossed the
Tasman in time to
join the First A.1.F.,
returning with severe
wounds in the left
arm. The results are
still apparent, but by
reversing the roles of
left and right arms
he can still drive a
golf ball straighter
and further than
most of his oppon-
ents. Field entered
the oil industry when
he came back from
the war, and was
soon Victorian
manager for the
Texas Co., as Caltex
was then known. In
1930 he became
general manager,
and now succeeds
OILMAN.
L. C. Kemp at the top of the tree —the
first local man to get there.
“Old Vic.” (from London): Robert
Helpmann, of Adelaide, seems to be de-
veloping as a spoilt child of the stage.
Making a name as a great dancer in
ballet, he himself devised a serious sequel
to “Hamlet.” Then, supporting Olivier
in Henry V, he played the Bishop of Ely
as a low-comedy part—without any
apparent authority from Shakspeare.
Now, going back to ballet, he is allowed
to double the parts of Prince Charming
and the Wicked Witch —and does both
well.
First award of the Hubert Church
Memorial Prize for Prose, established by
the widow of the M.L. poet, goes to
Monte Holcroft. The judges, Dr. G. H.
Scholefield and Prof. 1. A. Gordon, de-
scribed his volume of essays, “Timeless
World,” as showing “maturity of style
and literary craftsmanship.”
For his “contribution to literature”
F. J. H. Letters of New England Uni-
versity College (Armidale, N.S.W.) has
been made an honorary life-member of
the International Mark Twain, Society;
fellow hon. members include Eliot, Shaw,
Macleish, De la Mare and Churchill. The
distinction was conferred on the publica-
tion of an American edition of Letters’s
Virgil —a work of criticism and scholar-
ship which, in the Australian edition, was
recently praised on the Red Page.
Retiring after 38 active years pursuing
crime, Superintendent H. B. Wagener,
chief of the C. 1.8. in Melbourne. The
youngest policeman to attain to the rank
of superintendent, he was one of the 21
to form the first Victorian plain-clothes
division. As lecturer-instructor, he trained
hundreds of Johns in the art of crook-
chasing.
Into the silence:
In Melbourne, Dr. Vera Scantlebury-Brown,
one of Victoria’s leading child educationists
and one of the two Australian woman doctors
who served in the first World War. As Dir-
ector of Infant Welfare she inaugurated the
pre-school plan for children, got the co-opera-
tion of councils and voluntary organisations
and produced a great improvement in mor-
tality statistics.
In Brisbane, at 84, James Grant Pattison,
pastoralist, racing man and, under the pen-
name of “Battler,” popular historian of Cen-
tral Queensland. During 30 years of station
life he was associated with holdings at Car-
dowan, Purbrook Downs, Avoca, Belmont,
West Hill and Princhester.
In Brisbane, at 74, Alexander McCulloch,
for many years Queensland’s leading nomina-
tor of Scottish immigrants. Instrumental m
bringing in more than 500 fellow Scots since
his own arrival in 1909, he boasted that none
of them had failed to make good.
In Adelaide, at 92, Frank Bullock, of
Somerset, who had been a good Australian
for 87 years. He became a Bible Christian
minister in 1878, joined the Methodist Union
when that arrived, and spent his long ministry
in Broken Hill and various S.A. towns.


WOMEN'S letters
From Sydney
From the first of next month this State
will again have a full-time of a
part-time Governor. He is Lieut.-General
John Northcott, C. 8., M.V.0., and he
will be the first Australian-born Governor
of New South Wales. Accompanied by his
wife he will arrive in H.M.A.S. Arunta,
and to a salvo of guns and with R.A.A.F.
’planes flying overhead he will land at
Fort Macquarie. Then, after official wel-
come, he and the family will drive
through a city flying all its flags in wel-
come. Mounted police will give dignity
to the procession and the ’planes will con-
tinue to circle and dart overhead till his
Excellency and his wife are tucked into
Government House. No cheers will be
more hearty than those of the school
children of Sydney, who get a holiday in
honor of his coming. Miss Beth North-
cott flew to Sydney last Friday and spent
the week-end making arrangements for
her mother’s arrival at Government
House.
Trump cards in “Rose Marie” are the
Totem Ballet and Wanda, the half-
barbaric Indian girl. They will always
win the hearts of audiences the world
over. The Totem Ballet, colorful,
rhythmic, and bringing into the theatre
the feeling of wind rushing through the
grasses, of life primitive, full of hazard,
but with a great zest to it, kept the audi-
ence clapping hands madly last Saturday
night at the Royal. Wanda, in her solo
dance waving and weaving a great fan
of red and black feathers, is so supple
and willowy that dozens of women made
resolve to start in on the daily dozen
plus when springtime comes again. The
Rose Marie of this revival is Joy Beattie,
a Maorilander, who has lived in Christ-
church, Oamaru and Dunedin. Joy has
grace and a good voice and a capacity for
hard work —the stuff that success is made
of.
Headhunters will make straight for the
show of sculpture in David Jones’s gal-
lery. At the opening, population of the
room was equally divided between statues
and humans, It was embarrassing to
turn suddenly to pass a remark to a com-
panion, and find oneself staring into the
sculpted eyes of bronze or wood. At the
Education Galleries the gentle water-
colorist is in liquidation. But by the end
of the show, if sales live up to expecta-
tion, the exhibitors should all be able to
buy war savings certificates of high de-
nomination. Lyndon Dadswell, Daphne
Mayo and Arthur Fleischmann are the
three sculptors whose show was opened
midway through last week by Charles
Lloyd Jones, Professor A. H. Macdonald
called for cheers for the watercolorists
last Saturday.
From Adelaide: The sensation of the
moment here is the wedding of Captain
John Richardson, A.D.C. to Governor
Norrie, to the handsome Kathleen Price-
Turner, a daughter of one of Adelaide’s
oldest families, adopted on the death
of her parents by Dudley Turner, well-
known all about Australia for his war
work, and Mrs. Turner, nee Ayers, The
bridegroom is the son of an English
Judge.
Verdi’s sublime “Requiem” opened the
C.E.M.A. festival nobly. The Town Hall
"audience was swept on the soaring and
sometimes sombre wings of the composer,
and conductor Bernard Heinze must
have felt that he had his listeners as well
as his choir and orchestra well in hand.
The night’s bouquet for the soloists must
go to Melbourne soprano Sylvia Fisher.
Her voice and musicianly feeling are
about impeccable. Sydney’s own Heather
Kinnaird, however, had some fine
moments, and as she had taken the place
of Phyllis Raisbeck (laid low by the
laryngitis germ of the moment) at a day’s
notice her performance was something
of a triumph. Tenor William Herbert and
basso Stanley Clarkson were the men
Soloists.
Baritone Ron Jackson, who, with
Strella Wilson and pianist Mabel Nelson,
of Melbourne, went on a concert party
up China way, is recalling the unusual
and stimulating settings in which the trio
sang. In Hong Kong they were mostly
summoned to sing on board ships
in the harbor, where enemy craft,
half - submerged, can still be seen.
Sometimes they were in the open,
sometimes the decks were enclosed.
Always there were bumper houses. Even
now, the Peak of Hong Kong sparkles
with lights, though occasional black
patches indicate where bombs fell the
most thickly. At leave centres and
military hospitals the Australian group
received great welcome and applause.
Ron, who is continuing under the re-
habilitation scheme the studies the war
years interrupted, has made several
appearances in Conservatorium operas,
among them Dr. Bainton’s own “Pearl
Tree.”
Much regret is being expressed over
the death of Coralie Poolman, so well
known during the war years. in this
State. Coralie died last week in Mel-
bourne. Last Christmas time she had
undergone a serious operation in R.P.A.,
but her illness did not quench her laughter
and innate gaiety. She had great abilities
as a business woman, and she had a
sweet and well-trained mezzo voice. She
shared with Dorothy Wilby, her great
friend, assistant-controllership of V.A.Ds.
in N.S.W. till early last year. Dorothy
now has a daily session on one of
Melbourne’s commercial broadcasting
stations.
Frank McNamara, just out of the Ser-
vices after four years, has got together a
collection of his water-colors. They are
very often glimpses of Newcastle and
Maitland, and they may be a subtle ex-
planation why miners go on strike. Any-
one could be forgiven for going a.w.l. to
gaze on the beauties this painter has
found so close to his old home. For
Frank is a Newcastle boy. His father
and mother and an aunt came down
for the opening, which was done in
a crowded Grosvenor Galleries by
Mrs. Hubert Fairfax in much friend-
liness and admiration. This un-
assuming little show suddenly assumed
great artistic stature. Director of Mel-
bourne Gallery, Daryl Lindsay, came to
it and bought two pictures, and had them
wrapped up to take away with him. Our
own National Gallery Director, Hal
Missingham, has secured a treasure for
the State. Mrs. Hubert Fairfax and Mrs.
Vincent Fairfax were buyers; so was
Harry Dangar. He and Mrs. Dangar
came to town for the show, which is the
first given by this painter with the lyric
touch. Wal Taylor later on staged a
sherry party of congratulation.
One of the first balls our new Gover-
nor and his wife will attend is the R.S.L.
Victory Ball. This will be held in the
Trocadero on August 20, when a com-
pany of debutantes, daughters of ex-
servicemen, will be presented to his Excel-
lency and Mrs. Northcott by Mrs. Fred
Taylor, the subject of this photograph.
The ball will be the great social event of
the R.S.L. State Congress week. An
important guest will be new Federal
president Mr. E. Millhouse. The R.S.L.
plans to hold this ball every year to
commemorate the victory of 1945.
Colonel E, O. Milne is chairman of the
committee. Photograph by Phil Ward.
Old boys of “Shore” had their first
ball since 1939 last week, and hadn’t they
the gaiety at the Trocadero! The big
George-street ballroom was all blue and
white streamers, and “Shore’s” famed
boater popped up all about the place,
even on the table covers. One of these
boaters, grown to immense size, hung
aloft over the dancers. Blue and white
flower pieces were the popular table deco-
ration. President of the Old Boys’ Union
C. S. Tiley and Mrs. tiley received the
official guests, and among these was Mr.
R. G. H. Walmsley, just retired after half
a lifetime’s association with the school.
“Shore’s” headmaster L. C. Robson and
Mrs. Robson were among the im-
portants. The night was full of meetings
and greetings, for numbers of the old
boys having been away soldiering had
not foregathered since schooldays.
The artistry and refinement in Todd
Duncan’s voice are delighting more
and more Sydney music - lovers, and
another big audience on Saturday
revelled in a programme ranging from
Handel and Tschaikowsky to Hageman
and the inevitable spirituals. A vicious
wind whipping around the Town Hall
had arriving concertgoers snuggling
deeper into their furs and cloaks —which
mostly they kept on in the radiatorless
hall —with week-end hair-dos protected
by veiling or scarves.
From Melbourne
Joan Hammond again sang to a packed
house when she appeared for her last
concert in this city. The soprano wore
a black crepe frock, cut on tailored lines,
and her only ornaments were a sparkling
necklace of diamente and marcasite with
the bracelet repeating the pattern. The
gown was a London model which
Joan wore when she sang at the
Albert Hall. Frocking among the audi-
ence greatly improved on previous con-
certs, with formal gowns coming back
and sequin and diamente headbands in
favor. One snood affair featured a band
of gold studs, while a headband of black
sequins was worn with a matching “dog
collar.” Madeline Orr caught the eye in
a frock of white crepe patterned in
royal blue. Jill Lambert, wife of pianist
Raymond, topped off with white foxes a
lovely gown of deep rose-pink moire.
Kathleen Gepp set off her black Persian-
lamb coat with a tiny “pancake” hat of
brilliant red velvet. With Mrs. T. J. Ryan
was old friend Mrs. J. D. Harris, of
Coventry, England. Lieut.-Col. John
Mears was with his attractive fiancee Jill
McDonald, who set off her fair coloring
with a black frock,
Athol Shmith made this portrait of
Gwenda Wilson, a clever young actress
now starring in “The Hasty Heart.” Her
first big role was in “Kiss and Tell,”
which was followed by “Dear Ruth*
Gwenda is now rehearsing the lead in
“The Sun Shines,” which will open in
Adelaide. She is married to Don Sharp
of the “Dancing Years” company. A
few weeks ago Gwenda gave a backstage
party to celebrate the 100th performance
of her current role.
Latest appeal to be made by Lord
Mayor Connelly is for £50,000 to build
the Tally Ho Village, a training school
for boys. The Tally Ho Boys’ Training
Farm has been in operation for many
years, and is one of the institutions sup-
ported by Wesley Church. The farm has
taken care of boys without parents or
who, though lack of parental control,
have had trouble with the authorities.
Instead of the old method of the dormi-
tory system, the proposed new Tally Ho
Village will have individual cottages ; 12
boys and staff will live in each cottage.
There will be no high walls and no bars.
The village will have its community
centre, picture theatre, workshops and
clinic. Tally Ho is ideally situated 12
miles east of Melbourne, and the site has
a wide view of the Dandenongs. There
are almost 100 boys riow in residence at
the farm ; since 1903 over 2000 have been
trained there. About one half enter
industry, the rest go on the land. The
organisers of the appeal, which is now
in full swing, feel that no effort should
be spared to give these boys a chance
to become good Australians. To help
the funds along, visiting pianist Paul
Schramm gave a midday recital in the
Town Hall. It was a great success.
At a private preview of fashions in
wool arranged by the Australian Wool
Board dresses designed by such famous
people as Norman Hartnell, well-known
as the creator of fashions for Queen
Elizabeth, Worth, Molyneux, Matita
and many others were on show. But
although the designs were beautiful great
credit must go to the makers of the fab-
rics. They produced fine wool angoras,
mat - surfaced wool georgettes and
corded weaves as well as the most en-
trancing fabrics for lingerie. Fashioned
to delight the heart of any woman was
a lingerie set of metal-pink gossamer
wool, patterned in pale blue. The set
included a bias-cut nightgown with
matching cami-knicks and a negligee of
deeper pink wool crepe with a Regency
shawl collar'and ruffles of the patterned
wool. Skirts to give the rounded line were
either gathered or padded oyer the hips.
Narrow skirts were slit either at the side
or centre front.
For this show Molyneux designed
specially a delightful day ensemble of
navy-blue wool; pencil-slim with a
touch of white pique edging the high
neckline and matching the touches of
pique on the cuffs of the wide sleeves. In
workmanship and cut the models were
first-rate, particularly one sophisticated
wedding suit of white hopsack. The long
skirt was worn with a peplum jacket.
Even the hat was of white hopsack, but
veiled to suit the occasion. Evening
gowns are showing, new features. One
fashioned of aquamarine wool georgette
has no side seams; the front panels
wrapped round to a fishtail hip swathe
and the kimono sleeves, to match the
draperies, were sewn with gold sequins and
blue and gold beads in a flower-and-leaf
design. There was also a modified bare
midriff to this gown. “Dream Touch”
was the angora wool fabric which
fashioned an Edwardian wedding gown.
A broad panel of Brussels lace was set
across the front of the skirt to give an
apron effect, and heavy folds at the back
swept into a train. But instead of a veil
a wimple of the same material was
worn. Oatmeal-colored “Bermuda doe-
skin” was used for a bridesmaid’s frock
made with a deep peplum padded to make
bustle draperies'of emerald-green velvet.
Collar, cuffs and buttons were in brown
velvet, and a matching muff of velvet
was carried.
This year’s Gloucester ball, which is
arranged by the many young girls who
form the Gloucester Auxiliary to the
Prince Henry Hospital, was held at St.
Kilda Town Hall. Thirty-six debs., their
white frocks offset by fans of early-spring
blossoms, made their bow to Lady
Herring. After the presentation, with
their partners, they waltzed to the strains
of a Coward tune. Fifteen hundred after-
wards took the floor. So popular has
the Gloucester ball become that 500 could
not obtain tickets.
Lady Herring was gowned for the
occasion in burgundy lace. Daughter
Judith chose a blue organdie frock, the
tight bodice being allied to a bouffant
skirt. Younger daughter Molly was also
in blue; hers was a corded taffeta finely
striped in lolly pink. Kathleen Lascelles,
president of the auxiliary, wore a gown
of soft jade, silver-threaded satin ; into
the overdress she pinned clusters of
parma violets. Attractive Cherry Kaye,
one of the ticket secretaries, had flowers
appliqudd to the cape sleeves of her shell-
pink satin frock patterned in blue. Red
ribbon threaded the white yoke of Robin
Hill’s red moire taffeta frock ; Margaret
Viney’s white crepe tailored gown had a
high neckline, with buttons sewn with
crystal beads.
Feather hats were well in evidence at
the packed symphony concert under
Eugene Goossens’s conductorship.
Madame Goossens, who sat with Prof,
and Mrs. Bernard Heinze, was an attrac-
tive figure in a mink-covered aqua-green
crepe evening gown. Fair-haired, stately
Mrs. A. Dulieu perched a feather hat in
royal-blue shadings on top of her Ed-
wardian hair-do. Even the younger set
have gone in for feathers; Jean Darragh
chose a flat pancake model of pink
ostrich feathers. Dorrie O’Neill topped
her brown gold-threaded evening skirt
with a gold lame tunic blouse, and Joan
Finn added a cocoa fox bolero to her
formal gown of ruby velvet. Mrs. W,
R. Cock favored the new full-skirted
evening coat. Hers was made with a full
gathered back panel and was in mist-blue
wool angora.
Some of the most striking canvasses
included in the exhibition held by
Dominique Modesti are those that the
artist painted in Mexico. Vibrant with
color, they had drawn from Diego Rivera,
an authority on Mexican art and himself
a painter of note, the comment that they
were “among the most truthful interpre-
tations of the peculiar atmosphere of
Mexico.” The painter’s wife, in trim
black suit and silver fox furs, listened to
some nice remarks about her husband’s
work by Max Meldrum. Madame de
Ranitz, wife of the secretary to the Neth-
erlands Legation, was there, her brown
suit combining nicely with a shallow
brown hat trimmed with silver-grey
ostrich feathers. With Pat Wright, smart
in a black suit and high-crowned felt hat
with an old-gold ribbon trim, was Edmee
Monod, the pretty little Dutch dancer who
will soon give a recital at the Union
Theatre. Mrs. Aubrey Gibson was suited
in grey and Lynette Dickenson wore a
brown ermine coat over her smart frock.
Professor and Maurice’Belz were also in
the gathering, she in a smart black outfit.
Later Madame Modesti hostessed at after-
noon tea.

And that is why so many other-

Australian holders of this co.’s scrip
suffer an undeserved injustice through
Treasury control of Stock Exchange
prices. Official high for the ords. is 31s.
6d., whereas they fetch around 565. in the
free sharemarket in Maoriland. The
return at 31s. 6d. would be a juicy 9.5 p.c.
on the basis of last term’s 15 p.c. distri-
bution—it included a 5 p.c. victory bonus
—or an attractive 6.3 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div.
basis. At 565. the immediate return on a
10 p.c. basis is 3.5 p.c. On the same basis,
the scrip would be worth 50s. to an in-
vestor who looks for 4 p.c. on his money ;
and equity demands that a fair, not exces-
sive, return on current investment should
be the official target. The freezing of
sound securities at levels far below their
true market value amounts to official
devaluation of private assets and imposi-
tion of capital loss where these things
are least desirable —in cases of neces-
sitous liquidation. At 275, 6d. (Aust.) the
6 p.c. prefs. return 4.4 p.c.
The £739,613 of capital—2l9,2o6 6 p.c.
prefs. and 520,407 ords. —has the support
and assistance of £655,732 of reserves,
giving a net tangible backing of £6 9s. Bd.
prefs. and 465. 2d. ords.; and there is more
wheat in the ear than the eye can see,
notwithstanding disclosure of £288,000 of
inner reserves since 1942. For many years
the policy has been to keep divs. moder-
ate and underpin the financial structure,
visibly and otherwise, to meet the impact
of possible misfortune. The div, advanced
from 6 p.c. in 1939 to 8i p.c. in 1943 and
to 10 p.c. in 1945. Average distribution
over the last decade was 8 p.c., with very
comfortable margins.
The co. is a big merchant and planta-
tion owner with headquarters at Suva
(Fiji). Collapse of the copra market was
responsible for the contraction of profits
in 1939 ; then, during the early war years,
the shipping bottleneck and rising costs
kept earnings down. After Japan s entry
into the struggle, the principal Allied Gov-
ernments became involved in heavy ex-
penditure in the South Seas, and there
was, and still is, a ready demand for
copra and other island products at en-
hanced prices. Under these circumstances
the co.’s earnings went up with a rush.
The fighting ended in August, 1945, but
spending on war account continued for
most of the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts. Gross earnings (£271,057)
advanced £2886. Including an extra
£5123 for depreciation (£18,669) and un-
specified provision for taxation, exes.
(£184,187) took £2679 of the gain. Tak-
ing into die reckoning unexplained addi-
tions to reserves (£7300, down £675), the
net result was £94,210 (down £468), or
enough to pay the pref. div. and show
15.5 p.c. on ord. capital as against 15.6,
16.1, 15.7, 9.3, 8.1 and 8.3 p.c. back to
1940.
Though some recession of turnover can
be expected, the immediate outlook Tavors
maintenance of a high level of earnings.
There is still a wide gap between demand
and supply, and that augurs well for main-
tenance of the price of copra and other
island produce, and with the evaporation
of highly-paid war-time jobs the position
in the sugar industry is rapidly improving.
Meanwhile, the co. is pushing ahead with
its post-war building programme —a
motor repair shop at Suva and concrete
store at Sigatoka are already under con-
struction.
Outstanding feature of the financial
structure is the very strong liquid posi-
tion :

The business is in better trim than it has
been for many years. The parent makes
biscuits, cakes and plum-puddings, and
there are two subsidiaries—one turns out
ice-cream and the other dehydrated fruit
and vegetables. Over a‘long period keen
competition and difficulties associated
with plant and costs kept earnings and
distributions to shareholders at moderate
levels. War changed the picture. Turn-
over went up with a rush, and civilian
trade had to be curtailed to meet Gov-
ernment demands for emergency rations
and for service canteens, etc., while
activities of the Comforts Fund bumped
up the sale of plum-puddings, thus per-
mitting a much fuller and more profitable
use of plant. However, the div. was kept
down, allowing more to be put by than
was distributed. The cash holding bene-
fited and the co. is in a much stronger
position to face competition than it was
seven years ago.
Consider these figures:
Consolidated Figures.

Since 1939 £116,525 more has been
written off than spent on plant, and the
book value of freeholds has been reduced
by £57,931, while £357,217 has been
added to cash, etc., now £60,842 in excess
of paid capital. Last term the book value
of plant was reduced by 36.1 p.c,
(£22,003). Stocks were reduced by
£57,516, debtors’ balances increased by
£19,098, a healthy sign, and £80,597 was
added to cash, etc. The year’s improve-
ment in the more or less liquid surplus
(£331,744) was £59,642.
The co. is obviously well equipped to
finance remodelling of its factories and
replacement of old plant, which ought to
mean much so far as future earnings are
concerned. The board has also re-
established contact with some of its over-
seas agents, and is preparing to develop
an export trade again. Still, once arrears
of demand in the civilian trade have been
overtaken, and the transition period
merges into the post-war era, competition
can be expected to get an edge on it
again, costs will be difficult to restrain and
some recession in earnings from the high
level of the last few years is to be ex-
pected.
Last term civilian demand filled the gap
caused by tapering of Government orders.
Gross earnings (£288,782) stepped up
£17,365. Including a liberal £33,752
(down £560) for depreciation and £71,225
(up £2436) for taxation, exes. (£235,259)
took £15,004 of the increase. The net
result was thus £2361 stronger at £53,523,
the best showing in the co.’s history. It
was enough to pay the pref. div. and show
23,7 p.c. on the £200,000 of ord. capital
as against 22.5, 21.6, 18.2, 9.2, 8 and 8 p.c,
back to 1940. Half a point was added to
the div., making it 6 p.c., and £5OOO was
sent to the staff fund. The £30,523 that
remained lifted the lay-by to £219,615
stoutest prop capital has enjoyed since the
beginning of this century.
On the market the ords. are jammed
at the ceiling price of 235. 3d., at which
figure the return is 5.1 p.c. on a 6 p.c.
div. basis, with prospects. The net tan-
gible cover is 41s. lid. The prefs.,
covered by £5 3s. lid. in net tangibles,
seldom come on to the market.

This Adelaide trustee co. was formed
with the blessing of Elder, Smith and Co.
36 years ago, and for the last 26 of them
shareholders have had a steady 10 p.c.
p.a. Though the margin is narrowing,
prospects of the 10 p.c. continuing are
encouraging, subject, of course, to Gov-
ernment interference. Expansion of in-
dustrial and other trade activity in South
Aus. has helped to increase the volume
of business placed in the expert care of
the co., and so have the changes and un-
certainties and the maze of taxation and
other legislative controls that war and a
“managed” economy have brought about.
Greatest difficulty in the path of these
trustee cos. over the last half-dozen
years has been to prevent exes, running
too far ahead of the moderate advance in
earnings. Corpus and other commission
charges are anchored by legislation, and
always have been. Official controls have
repressed capital -values, retarded realisa-
tion of estates, forced down interest rates
and kept rents low. While a rigid ceiling
has been thus maintained over the factors
affecting earnings, costs, especially taxa-
tion, have not been Similarly restrained.
The growth in exes, has outstripped the
growth in earnings, thus resulting in a
slight recession in net earnings, despite
steady expansion of the business.
Over the last five years the growth in
the volume of trusts on the books
amounted to £3,058,541, or nearly as
much as the increase over the preceding
decade. The net growth last term was
£286,542:

Gross earnings stepped up £5790. Exes,
took all but £69 of the gain, leaving the
net result at 12.3 p.c. on the £90,000 of
capital, compared with 12.3, 14.5, 14.9,
14.9, 14.9 and 15.8 p.c. back to 1940.
After writing £6OO off the book value ot
premises and sending £1289 to the staff
fund, £290 was put on the shelf, lifting
reserves to £81,832.
When the books closed shareholders’
funds (capital and reserves combined),
together with £948 coming to sundry
creditors, were represented by freeholds,
etc., £60,200, book debts £5245, Govern-
ment securities £106,966 and cash, etc.,
£6159.
The pound shares, paid to ss. each, are
at the ceiling price of 15s. 3d. on the
market, at which figure the return is 3.3

Tantalite Industries Holding Pty., a
Sydney concern, has taken an option ovei
the deposits and plant of Tantalite, Ltd.,
at Wodgina, Tabba Tabba and Strelley,
all on the Pilbara field (W.A.). Comment-
ing on the workings at Wodgina, Dr.
Keith Miles of the Westralian Geological
Survey says: “What has amounted vir-
tually to surface mining of a number of
rich shoots, together with treatment of
material derived directly from the disin-
tegration of outcrops of these shoots, has
in the main been sufficient to provide
enough ore to fill the co.’s intermittent
contracts. It is probable, therefore, that
there is still a great deal of tantalite yet
to be obtained from this lode. The ore
body is large, continuous and has yet to
be thoroughly tested below the surface.
The ore-dressing plant at Wodgina con-
sists of crusher, jigs and Wilfley concen-
trating tables. When dried the concen-
trates are passed , through a magnetic
separator, then bagged and transported to
the coast for shipment, mostly to Fansteel
Metallurgical Corp., Chicago (U.S.A.).
The price of the concentrate varies
according to quality; 60 p.c. grade
fetched about £1256 a short ton in 1943,
or £2O 18s. Bd. per unit. From tantalite,
one of the world’s rarest and most re-
markable ores, comes tantalum, used for
steel-hardening, in making all kinds of
electrical and radio apparatus, as a sub-
stitute for platinum, and in surgical in-
struments, fine drills, pen-points, watch-
springs, etc. It is non-rusting, can be
beaten into sheets as thin as paper and
is more malleable than gold. War opened
up new uses and created new demands
for the stuff.

There has been increasing London
market interest in Gold Exploration and
Finance shares. The co. owns about 97
p.c. of the shares in Western Mining
Corp., 30 p.c. of the stock of Gold Mines
of Kalgoorlie, 26 p.c. of Triton, 62 p.c.
of Gold Mines of Australia and 44 p.c. of
Victoria Gold Dredging. Western Mining
Corp. owns 81 p.c. of the shares in Central
Norseman, which it manages; it also
manages and advises G.M. of Kalgoorlie
and Triton. Divs. by Western Mining
have been 6d. a share 1943, 3s. 1944, 6d.
1945, Is. 1946, and these have been one
source of income for Gold Exploration ;
another contributor has been Victoria
Gold Dredging, which has been working
lower ground lately and handing on a
reduced distribution. Its latest accounts
are expected any day. Gold Exploration
has wiped off a large p. and 1.
debit over the war years, and is now in
a robust financial position, holding up-
wards of £370,000 stg. in cash and Gov-
ernment stock. Elimination of double
taxation would be a help. There is
£913 016 of stock issued, m 10s. units.
The units are quoted at 13s. Bd. sterling m
London, against a lowest of 7s. in 194 D.

Great Boulder’s profit for 1945 was
£93,262, or £2495 less than for 1944. Divi-
dends already paid or declared in respect
to 1945 amount to 9d. stg. a share, com-
pared with 3d. in 1944. Ore treated in-
creased from 274,720 tons in 1944 to
306,202 tons in 1945, but grade fell from
5 16dwt to s.osdwt. Working costs rose
from 335. l\d. to 345. sd. Gold produced
totalled 71,564 fine oz. Ore reserves were
only slightly lower at 2,392,000 tons.
Underground diamond-drilling to test the

Star, Ltd. (W.A.) is steadily increasing.
Last month 50,845 tons of ore and an
unstated quantity of residues were treated
for 12,263 fine oz. A year ago, when the
tonnage of ore treated was less than half
that, gold production was a little more
than 7000 oz. a month. This co. is the
largest individual gold-producer in the
Commonwealth.

£600,000 stg. in 2s. shares, of which
4,480,000 are issued and fully-paid, in-
cluding 1,980,000 vendor shares. In addi-
tion, £25,000-worth of 10 per cent, five-

Directors of Blue Spec (W.A.) announce
the milling of 1210 tons of 16.2dwt. ore
for June, which, they claim, proves their
anticipation of 1000 tons a month to be
conservative. They add that “share-
holders may confidently hope for con-
tinuation of an improvement on this ton-
nage.” Nothing is said about when profits
are likely to be earned. At present, co. s
debt to the Commonwealth is £133,500.
Paid capital is only £47,158. Accumu-
lated concentrates on hand or in course
of realisation are given a value of £30,000.
The board has asked the Federal authori-
ties to agree to an arrangement whereby
half of future profits (if any) are to be
used to liquidate the debt to the Govern-
ment and the other half to finance ex-
pansion of operations and to pay divs.

SUNDRY SHOWS
HOPE FOR THE THEATRE.
A play is not necessarily great art be-
cause it was written by a foreigner, or
written centuries ago, or even because it
was written by an important playwright.
Gogol’s “Diamond Cuts Diamond,” the
first play of three put on by Sydney
Mercury Theatres at the Conservatorium,
is essentially a trifling confection.
At its best, in the original Russian, it
is possibly the equivalent of an O. Henry
short story ; being a simple and obvious
comedy with a “wow” ending in which a
gambler is fleeced 1 by other gamblers.
Weakened by translation, it is hardly
more than the typical “magazine” story
one sees in the dailies. Seeing it as the
opening production of a group with big
plans—and big possibilities—for creating
a living theatre in Australia, one wonders
why, if a play of that type was thought
desirable, the producers had not per-
suaded some Australian playwright to do
them an adaptation of one of Henry
Lawson’s Steelman and Smith yams,
which are of exactly the same type, but
which have their roots in the soil of this
country.
Next on the programme was a 17th
century one-acter by the Spanish play-
wright Lope de Vega, a very simple
earthy comedy entitled “The Pastry-
baker,” concerned with the hunger and
rogueries of two servants of a doctor.
It has the quality of a clown scene
from Shakspeare Launcelot Gobbo
and his father, say—or of an ex-
tract from “The Knight of the
Burning Pestle.” Played with much
(very noisy) leaping and bounding, it
gave the impression that the programme
was designed to have the effect of an
evening of “divertissements” at the ballet.
And had Mercury Theatres done no
more than that, one would have been in-
trigued, gently entertained, and one would
certainly have attended their next pro-
duction. Not so much because two
plays of historical interest had been per-
formed —though any student of literature
would welcome a glimpse of Gogol and
Lope de Vega—but because there was
no taint of amateurishness about the
shows. William Constable’s sets were
delightful, his costumes beautiful. The
acting throughout showed not only a
rarely uniform competence, but also
vitality and a genuine feeling for char-
acter.
But that would not have been enough
to assure an audience that Mercury
Theatres was capable of really big things.
There would be something arty about a
whole programme of divertissements.
Give “The Pastrybaker” all the praise pos-
sible and still —like ballet comedy—there
is something rarefied about it; an admir-
able period piece, but not quite living
theatre; not really as funny as “Mo’s”
sketches at the Tivoli; and “Mo” is
genuine theatre. Somebody very like
“Mo” would have played in “The Pastry-
baker” in Lope de Vega’s time, and it
would take not a good actor but a great
clown really to bring it to life today.
It is not, in any case, good, honest
custard-pie clowning that Sydney is
hungering for; nor light comedy of the
“Diamond Cut Diamond” variety. The
need —the great hunger that has brought
Mercury Theatres into being—is for
drama. Power, vitality, passion, life ; the
full opportunity for the actor, the full
excitement for the audience.
This Mercury Theatres did not quite
achieve. But they proved they could do
it. “The Broken Pitcher,” the third play
of the evening, was triumphantly alive.
It was comedy again, but the genuine
comedy of character; a village piece
about a scoundrelly magistrate, an angry
housewife and two distracted young
lovers ; with the rich, rustic flavor of a
short story by De Maupassant or a novel
by Balzac. It was written by a German,
Heinrich von Kleist, who died in 1811,
and it’s set (charmingly; like a painting
of a Dutch interior) in Holland in 1788 ;
and —because it’s based in eternal human
realities—it’s as fresh as the day it was
written. It was splendidly acted, notably
by Peter Finch, John Dease, Alan Pool-
man and Mitchell Hill, and it would
attract and hold big audiences. This, cer-
tainly, was the real thing.
* * * *
“Rose Marie” has come to roost again
at Sydney Royal. Wilfred Johns, playing
Jim Kenyon, is somewhat too pallid even
for a paleface. Joy Beattie, Norma
Neville, Natalie Raine and Don Nicol,
if not exactly new wine, put a certain
amount of sparkle into the old, old bottle.
♦ * * *
Benn Levy’s “Springtime for Henry,”
put on as starter in a season of comedy
at the National Theatre, Melbourne, is
so lacking in substance as to be almost
non-existent. It concerns a woman who
wants to be “decent” and is decent
enough to shoot her husband. She also
wants to reform a roue and her actions
in this direction provide most of the play’s
humor, if a positive word like humor
can be applied to Mr. Levy’s efferves-
cence. John Lanigan, Claude Thomas,
June Jago and Pat Henry did their best
to give reality to the opus, but Mr, Levy
beat them.
Australian Watercolor
Institute.
The work of John Eldershaw, who on
past performance is one of the best water-
colorists in Australia, is disappointing at
the Australian Watercolor Institute exhi-
bition at the Education Department Gal-
leries, Sydney. “Aloe,” for instance, a
dull, glum picture with a smudgy back-
ground, is probably the worst painting he
has done for years—totally different from
his usual full clear washes. His other
paintings—“ Silo,” “Foreshore,”
“Hayfield” and “Boats”-—have vivin
touches, but no excellence: the final ex-
pression being marred, usually, by a kind
of mistiness —almost a fuzziness —which
gives them an appearance of incomplete-
ness. In “Hayfield” the hay itself is a
fine clear yellow, but the trimmings, as
it were, are disappointing: the sky has
the cut-out look of some of Max Ragless's
paintings. The best of the group is
“Boats,” a slight and pleasing impression
with warm coloring.
If Eldershaw’s comparative failure was
surprising, the improvement of G. K.
Townshend was equally impressive. For
some time this painter has been painting
greys, in minor keys, without quite achiev-
ing the desired lyrical effect. But in this
exhibition he has two very lovely paint-
ings, one of a road, rocks and sky in
high, ragged country, the other a sea-
piece with a masterly foreshore of
boulders and shallow pools. A headland
which extends too far slightly mars the
balance of this painting.
Norman Lindsay’s “Landfall” is large
for a watercolor, and brilliantly ex-
ecuted, showing a boat laden with pirates
drifting down a blue stream, with beauti-
ful nudes watching them from the near
shore. The shore is studded with caves
and from it vegetation sweeps down like
clusters of jewels.
The best of Margaret Coen’s paintings
is “Oriental,” a large flower-piece, glowing
with subdued fire. There is a sumptuous
quality about the coloring, not only of
the flowers but of the vase. Oddly
enough, when the same treatment is
switched to another object, the method
seems to fail. “Autumn Gold, Duck-
maloi,” shows a splendid golden tree,
with a variety of subtle autumn shadings,
which, taking the tree by itself, would
make the painting excellent. But taken
as a whole the effect is over-rich. The
pool is a rich, deep blue, against which
the gold shadow of the tree is startling.
Arthur J. Murch’s “The Wave” has
light and vitality, a fleeting impression of
figures under a wave, with a fine glisten-
ing coloring. There are two figures, a
man and a woman, and of the two the
woman is the better. Some opportunity of
dramatic contrast was lost by giving them
the same pigmentation.
In several paintings of mountain
country Dora Jarret has tried to achieve
a breaking of mist and pouring-in of
light. Although the effort is commend-
able, the results are only patchy. Once
she very nearly succeeds, but in most
cases the hills crowd unnaturally to the
front, as though anxious to inspect the
visitors.
Among other paintings worth noticing
are Kenneth Mac Queen’s “Backwater”
(much livelier than previous, frozen pat-
terns), Peter Lindsay’s slight “Shelled
Prahoe,” J. W. Maund’s sketch of “Pea
Pickers” and a thinnish but delicate
flower-piece by Rah Fizelle.
For the rest, Hal Missingham has
several formula-ridden landscapes, Ron-
ald Steuart has some empty designs and
Frank Medworth’s “Sydney Harbor, Late
Afternoon,” resembles nothing so much
as a port in Mars after a violent explo-
sion. The show as a whole needs more
color and more animation.
* * * *
“F.S.”: Noel Counihan, Joseph Berg-
ner and Victor O’Connor, who have been
holding a joint show at Myer’s, label
themselves as “Three Realist Artists.”
Counihan paints miners working in damp
conditions and slum dwellings, Bergner
paints Jews cooped up in ghettoes and
being hounded about the country and
O’Connor does a bit of both. Why is
this particularly realistic? Why are
Counihan’s miners and Bergner’s Jews
any more realistic than a Rembrandt self-
portrait, in which there is no idealisation,
and in which there is certainly much
better painting? Are O’Connor’s pic-
tures of ladlehands on night shift more
realistic than a Velasquez portrait of a
court lady? Is an indifferently-painted
street in an industrial suburb more real
than a superbly painted “Grand Canal in
Venice,” by Turner? Leaving out the
labels, however, Counihan has painted
an excellent likeness of Melbourne’s old
violin maker, William Dolphin, and Berg-
ner is amusing in his illustrations of
humorous Jewish folk tales.

Evelyn Baxter, a girl of 23 who is hold-
ing her first exhibition at Sedon’s, Mel-
bourne, has done something Streeton,
Heysen, Hilder and a host of other emi-
nent painters never did —she sold all but
five of her pictures before the show
opened. With some trepidation, Streeton
marked the prices for his first exhibition
round about five guineas. Miss Baxter
asked prices ranging from 30 to 60
guineas and she sold the highest-priced
first, her total earnings for three years’
study being over 1000 guineas. The rifles
of her paintings —“Xmas Lilies,” “Vio-
lets,” “Red Camellias”—indicate their
subject matter; Miss Baxter sees what
everybody else sees in Nature and puts
it down with quiet assurance.

Evidently striking his best riding form again,
J. Thompson brought off a hat-trick of suc-
cessive winners at Canterbury on Saturday
and was twice in the minor money. It was a
fine bit of riding that landed the solid favorite
Thrums a winneV in the nine-furlongs En-
courage. The Kuvera gelding was thoroughly
boxed in most of the trip and still badly placed
at the leger, but Thompson pulled him clear
inside the distance and practically lifted him
over the fine ahead of Rose Glory and Mas-
sena, only a neck and a half-lertgth separating
them. Connections certainly deserved the win
with Thrums, who a few weeks back finished
second to Mt. Howitt in a Novice race for
which the winner was subsequently found to
be ineligible. Thrums was then placed first
and connections collected the prizemoney, but,
against that, bets on Thrums and his eligi-
bility for Maiden and Novice events were for-
feited.
In the Flying Thompson rode Earl Pen-
theus, a warm equal favorite, and, meeting
Victory Lad 61b. better than when beaten by
him the previous week, the Pentheus gelding
turned the tables. Had Victory Lad had
a few pounds allowance for a good apprentice
he should have won; as it was he ran a fine
race, moving up to join Earl Pentheus in the
straight and battling out every inch of the
final half-furlong, but 9.12 against the winner’s
Bst. meant the difference of the half-neck by
which Earl Pentheus scored. Chantilly and
Jamelie set such a bat in the early stages that
for once Civic Pride was unable to take the
lead, but she outlasted the other pah for third
place.
When he finished behind Codicil in a recent
S.T.C. Handicap Shining Night was in bother
ail the way, locked in on the rails and only
breaking clear in the last furlong. In Satur-
day’s similar event Thompson took care to
avoid repetition of that error, and, with no
Codicil to contend with, Shining Night won
splendidly. Bowling along well back in the field
he was kept always outside one or two others;
thus he covered extra ground, but, despite top
weight of 8.10, was in a winning position at
the leger and produced too stout a finish for
Sancourt and Royal Peer, It was the old Fox-
bridge gelding’s 80th start in a race, and he
looks fit to add a few to that score.
While Shining Night was mowing them down
at Canterbury another son of Foxbridge was
taking his first look at Australia —the outstand-
ing N.Z. two-year-old Barwon just arriving in
Sydney. From four starts Barwon has won
three races and was once left at the post. With
only fote betting in N.Z. his name was quite
acceptable there, but here he is to race as Lord
Barwon to avoid betting confusion.
Unsuccessful two-year-olds had almost their
last chance to win a race as such in a Two-
year-old Maiden Handicap. Originally it
attracted 85 entries, and with 37 acceptors was
run in two divisions. Wailemata, a chestnut
colt by Waikare-Fryer’s Song, showed up prom-
isingly at his only previous start, earning him-
self a handicapper’s opinion of 8.7. An allow-
ance of 51b. for W. Streeting balanced the dis-
advantage of being widely drawn at the bar-
rier, and Waitemata defeated The Cad and
Timoana in a photo.-finish, the margins being a
half-head and a neck. In the second division
the Merry Matthew gelding Merry John (G.
Moore) downed Silver Damsel and Tale Teller.
Just pipped on Victory Lad, W. Cook made
up for it by taking the Three-year-old Handi-
cap on Edinburgh, overhauling Yankee Lad
in a close finish; Buonarroti Boy was third, re-
turning his place-tote supporters £l7 17s. 6d.
for ss. Finally justifying the heavy support
he has had at recent starts, Sir Neith managed
to win the nine-furlongs Welter. With a 51b.
allowance for J. Hickey he carried 9.6 to down
Gallant Law and Maritime.
* * * *
. The South Australian hurdler David Star
added to the recent remarkable record of six-
year-olds in jumping events with an easy win
in the Delamere Hurdle at Mentone on Satur-
day. He’s not, as might be thought, another
of the David stock, but a Glideaway gelding.
Jumping very well for a while, Time had a
long lead early, but failed to stay. Red Alder
had charge with half a mile left of the two-
miles journey, but David Star had no trouble
relegating him to second place by a five-lengths
margin, with another eight lengths to Pat'io.
Big fields of two-year-olds still maidens with
the season practically over contested the five-
furlongs Mallacoota Handicap in two batches,
the Actor filly Fairy’s Flight getting there by
half a head from Native Bell, with Gilwell
over two lengths away third, and the Kinder-
scout filly Miss Lottie fairly easily accounting
for the odds-on Rareone and Miss Tracey.
Native Bell, a Caithness colt, finished best of
the first division lot, just failing by inches to
run down the leader. Rareone, a Great
Legend colt, also seemed unlucky, failing to
get a clear run till too late.
The Berkeley Handicap (six furlongs) was
also for two-year-olds, the Law Maker-
Joanna colt King’s Law landing the money
from another Law Maker, Bray Law, with
the John James colt Parody third. There was
heavy backing for the country performer Sir
Charles.
The Ascot Thousand, run over six furlongs,
looked the most open race of the day, and
proved even more open than it looked, the
outsider Valline, a five-year-old mare by
Valiant Chief-Devon Cross, downing True
Law and Great Win, with such performers as
Greensborough, Three Wheeler, Fine Fettle,
Enthuse and Action among the also-rans.
Like the two-year-old Maiden event, the
Heatherbrae Handicap (seven furlongs) for
three-year-olds had to be run in two divi-
sions, the Valiant Chief colt Glenfern taking
the first from Curtain Time and Lindsay’s
Gift, and the Windbag colt Lord Beaufort just
downing Somers, with Rose Bay third, in a
dingdong finish that saw Badger, Breasley
and Heather, three of the best riders in the
business, flat out to the post. Glenferrfs
win was an extra good one. Winning his
second successive distance event, Stenelaus had
over two lengths to spare from Gala Chief
and Irate in the 13-furlongs Lincolnshire
Handicap, completing the bill of eight events.
Gala Chief carried top weight (9.5) and was
having his first run for a couple of months;
a more than promising performance.

“Those fellow s up there must drink like fish!"
There wasn’t anything surprising in the
allotting of a 10.10 steadier to Bernborough m
the Caulfield Cup—after all, though he beat
little, he did win the Victory Cup in Brisbane
over 1 mile 3 furlongs carrying lib more than
he has been asked to lump over the Caulfield
mile and a half. But 10.9 in the Melbourne
Cup is a real plaster! Those who took him m
the trwo-Cups double before the weights must -
have had very itchy money, and can now kiss it
good-bye. Apart from the weights, there s a
King’s Cup in Sydney about a week beto.c the
Caulfield Cup, and, with the special poundage
involved, the Sydney event should be easy -or
the champion.

Clear evidence of the excellent track they
have in Grafton (N.S.W.) was given in the
times for various events at last week s annual
Cup meeting. Both the Sydney galloper
Oriental and Queenslander Red Mick, respective
winners of the Ramornie and Barnes Handi-
caps, cut out the six furlongs in 1.12 T ,
which is a great deal better than can be done
on the S.T.C.’s Moorefield course, where the
record for the distance is 1.145, and that was
put up by the brilliant sprinter Pentheus m
1930. Also at Grafton, Birthright, owned by
the Gaekwar of Baroda, cut out the Munro
Handicap five furlongs in 60 secs., and Gudde-
gang covered the Bawden Welter seven furlongs
in 1.25 f. The locally owned four-year-old
Spearfelt-My Treasure horse Spearex won the
£lOOO Cup by a couple of lengths from Silent
and High Tension.
The name K. O’Mara as C.RJ.C. secretary
on the Grafton Cup meeting programme is a
modest deception. The K stands for Kathleen,
one of the few women to have held sucn
a post in Australia. Judging by the Cup
meeting success, a lot of other country clubs
might do well to try a Miss for sec.

H. Badger, making a run on Ellipsis about
a furlong and a half from home in the Birth-
day Handicap at Flemington in June, asked I.
Unkovitch, on Latani, for a little more room.
As reported to the stewards, it appeared that
Badger afterwards told Ellipsis’s trainer, r.
Hoysted, that he owed Unkovitch a tenner
for the favor. As it was only a matter ot
Ellipsis getting a clear run for him to win,
none of those concerned thought they d com-
mitted any offence, but the V.R.C. stewards
took such a dim view of it that they asked
Badger, Unkovitch and Hoysted to cough up
£lOO each.

Melbourne downed Carlton, 10.12-7.13;
Essendon stayed in the lead per a one-
point victory over Sowth, 10.8-9.13 ; Col-
lingwood overcame Fitzroy, 8.13-8.8;

East’s Rugby Union team is an unspec-

“Bo” attends a Great Sporting Event:
With the “ashes” already decided, the Chooms
having followed up a draw in the first ‘ Test
with an easy win in the Brisbane match, it
might have been supposed that even Sydney
mugs, who are legion, would have anticipated
the inevitable slump in the third “Test” match,
Rugby League “sports” being notoriously shy
'of following hopeless teams.
Apparently hoping that press
photographers and reporters
would be on the job, the
usual “fans” arrived to spend
a chilly all-night vigil to grab
the best “possies,” and a
frantic rush by quarter-wilted
enthusiasts to be among the
first in crowded the dawn
trams. Most of them, several
hours later, were gloomily
looking round for some cats
to kick as they viewed the
large human-free spaces of
Hid and' stand and reflected
that they could have slept
soundly in bed till 11 a.ra.
and sull have had a wide
choice of positions. Attend-
ance was a mere 35,000, and
there was a great deal of
“paper.”
But gall was to crowd on
the wormwood. If flying
boots and fists, rabbit-punch-
ing, “chinning,” rubbing
heads in the dirt, mulling
easy passes and lollypop
catches constituted good
football the third ‘‘Test
could have been justly de-
scribed as brilliant. If Aus-
tralia’s trio of cop repre-
sentatives only rushed around
after evildoers with as great
gusto as they were aimless
in their efforts after Mr.
Risman and Co., Sydney’s
crime wave would be but a
ripple. And any gangster
present would have derived
intense satisfaction from
seeing one of the cops, a Mr. Clues, sent
off for swinging a punch at the English cap-
tain, a man nearly old enough to be his
father. England’s 15-stone forwards often
outpaced Australia’s three-quarter line, one
of whom provided easily the most exciting phase
of the match by nearly losing his pants.
Pondering after the debacle the inescapable fact
that the home team, in being beaten 20-7 by
a very ordinary English team which frankly
admits that it would be walloped by Wigan,
played far less brainy football than that turned
on in a preliminary match by Queensland and
N.S.W. schoolboys, the early-morning vigi-
lantes, loudly protesting that it would be the
last so-and-so League “Test” they'd ever see,
made for the bar to drown their sorrows.
There was plenty of beer.

M.C.C. Australian tour;
It won’t be the fault of the selectors if the
M.C.C. team fails to take home the “ashes”
after the Australian tour, which begins at
Perth on October 11. Already 39 diiierent
players have taken part in two trial matches
and a Test against India. Of the dozen
chosen last week only Walter Hammond
(capf.), Bill Voce and Joe Hardstaff have pre-
viously played in Australia, where in first-class
matches Hammond scored 1553 runs, av. 91.35,
in 1928-29, 948, av. 55.76, in 1932-33, and
1205, av. 66.94, in 1936-37; Hardstaff rattled
up 850, av. 34, in 1936-37; Voce got 32
wickets, av. 27.87, in 1932-33, and 35 wickets,
av. 31.37, in 1936-37.
Opening batsmen Hutton, of % Yorkshire
(who belted Australian bowlers for 364 at The
Oval in 1938), and Washbrook, of Lanca-
shire, have been piling up centuries; Denis
Compton, of Middlesex, hard-hitting right-
hand bat and left-hand bowler, has been in
rare form; and the others are N. Yardley
(Yorkshire) and J. Ikin (Lancashire), all-
rounders; wicketkeepers P. Gibb (Yorkshire)
and T. Evans (Kent); D. Wright (Kent); and
A. Bedser (Surrey), the medium-fast bowler
who took 11 for 145 in the first Test against
India.

Sydney Stadium regulars saw a very
unusual boxer in action on Saturday
night in Ted Ashenden from Adelaide,
one of five soldier-brothers who saw
service in the Middle East and New
Guinea, and himself a Tobruk Rat. Ted
looked like a fighter from Fightville
opposed to the Westralian Leo Heaney,
beating the hostile lightweight in every
round till Heaney was disqualified for
butting in the fifth. He had been thrice
cautioned for the same offence.
Featherweight Ken Hatcher, knocked
out by Ted Sprouster at Sydney Stadium
last year, had his revenge when they met
again at Leichhardt. Five pounds lighter
than Sprouster, he outpointed that pug
in 11 of the 12 rounds.
Back in the game after a long spell,
during which he managed to put on a
bit of weight which will be useful to him
when he meets Patrick, Eddie Miller gave
a sterling exhibition of boxing at Mel-
bourne. He had Alby McCarthy to
practise on. Alby was still in the ring at
the end of the 12th round, but didn’t seem
quite clear about it.

Inflation and Money
A cable from London last week men-
tioned that “responsible quarters now
find nothing fantastic in the argument
that sterling may yet look dollars in the
face at the old parity.” It added that
the labor unrest problem should be re-
solved soon, after which the American
industrial machine will begin to pour out
a torrent of goods. The threat of infla-
tion in Britain itself was now almost
negligible, it was contended. “The
Banker” was quoted: “The problem of
deflation, riot inflation, will fill the Ameri-
can and world horizon.”
Collectively, a most challenging set of
opinions and predictions.
“The Banker’s” opinion is the most
revolutionary heard for several years.
Most people still believe inflation to be
the greatest financial problem confront-
ing the English-speaking world at least,
with production the greatest political
question. Though increased production
centres on the simple—but stubborn —
difficulty of overcoming wage-earners’ re-
luctance to work as industriously as
formerly, the inflation problem is far
more complex, involving as it does a
hard clash of varied monetary rights and
production incentives.
It would be extremely foolish to treat
the inflation problem lightly at the present
time. Inflation is the disease to which all
post-war economies are subject, and the
recent war was the most economically
costly of all time. There is no economic
penicillin that will kill inflation once
created.
Monetary and credit inflation has been
widespread during the war, the full effect
being curbed by price-controls. In Aus-
tralia buying-power in the trading banks,
savings banks and central banks has
more than doubled. Savings-bank
deposits in particular have grown to over
two and two-thirds times the 1939 figure.
In Great Britain the position has been
even more pronounced; savings-bank
deposits have more than trebled, while
commercial-bank deposits have almost
doubled. In the United States s.-b.
deposits have nearly doubled, with a great
subscription to the equivalent of war-
savings certificates. Trading-bank deposits
have grown to two and a third times the
1939 total. In Canada s.-b. deposits have
made a smaller increase, the expansion
being about 70 p.c., but deposits in the
commercial banks have lifted by 110 p.c.
In New Zealand s.-b. figures have grown
to two and a fifth times pre-war totals,
and other banks double.
In Australia the war-time rise in the
cost of living is admitted to be 23 p.c.,
in Britain 32 p.c., in the United States
31 p.c. (to February), in Canada 19 p.c.
New Zealand has scrambled its cost-of-
living indexes so that war-time inflation
in prices, etc., cannot be readily dis-
cemed. These rises have occurred inside
controlled economies, official reliance
upon controls often adding to inflationary
forces.
The rise in actual wages in Australian
factories during the war (to June 30,
1945) has been men 38 p.c., women 41
p.c. Prices have not yet risen in propor-
tion.
In all countries except the United States
price-control is being rigorously en-
forced. In the U.S.A. the lapse may be
only temporary, but what is happening to
prices there is some indication of “free”
market conditions. In Britain during the
current year it is estimated that sub-
sidies raised by taxation, in order to keep
prices stable, will cost the Government
£335 million sterling—the greatest sum to
date. In Australia last year price sub-
sidies, including assistance to rural pro-
ducers, cost £33 million Australian.
“There will certainly be no saving this
‘Is this the joint where the spoutin has to be fixed?"
year,” said Mr. Chifley, “and there may
yet be some increase.”
The Australian basic wage will rise in
August by Is. a week, and many contend
that living costs are much higher than
the basic wage suggests.
There has been almost world-wide
pressure for higher wages and a shorter
working week since the end of the war.
This has been most noticeable in the
United States and Australia. Whatever
concessions wage-earners have received
have been inflationary in character. An
anti-inflationary feature of the position
has been the fact that American industry
has contested wage-earners’ demands, but
usually the settlement has been a com-
promise, with much production, the
normal offset to inflation, lost during the
strike.
The world is short of food and of cloth-
ing still, two things that are usually pro-
duced readily to meet demand. The
housing shortage and a leeway in motor-
car, machinery and engineering produc-
tion will take years to overcome, indi-
cating that employment should be fully
available to those willing to work. With
a world excess of spending-power on one
hand and a shortage of production on the
other, and with labor not yet pulling
its weight fully in Britain, America or
Australia, the long-term prospect is cer-
tainly not one of deflation, even if, occa-
sionally, there are temporary deflections
from the general trend.
'What has been achieved in controlling
prices in most countries is unlikely to be
maintained for a great deal longer. Pro-
duction costs are rising and eating into
profit - margins, and so into incen-
tives to produce. The world’s material
demands are mainly those of production.
Therefore fiscal policy must be bent to
increase production, even if that means
a gradual bending of price-control
powers.
While the world’s problems must re-
main one of inflation for a long time,
whatever can be achieved in combating
inflation in the way of greater production
(assisted by mechanical developments),
reduced costs or restrained consumer
spending of an unessential character is all
to the good. Britain will be well advised
to maintain strict controls over internal
costs until external costs, such as expenses
of importing food, become in keeping
with reasonable peace-time conditions.
There will be more chance then of estab-
lishing a stable costs figure at a not-too-
high level, which will help both exports
and the exchange rate, at the same time
preserving the value of war loans and
other savings at something near their
original value.
Whether sterling is going to “look dol-
lars in the face at the old parity” (4.86
to the £) will depend very greatly upon
the development' of Britain’s external
trade. The expression, incidentally, seems
rather to contradict Professor Laski’s
valuation of Britain as a world Power.
Immense faith is possessed by this paper
in Britain’s industrial and trading skill,
but it will be only after this skill has been
employed for some years that the pound
sterling will be able to look in the face
a dollar that goes 35 to the ounce of
gold. Whatever the purchasing-power
parity of a nation’s currency, where that
nation is heavily indebted to other coun-
tries, where its industrial machine has
been actually damaged by war, where it
has lost most of its overseas investments,
and where it depends largely upon over-
seas countries for food, raw materials and
fuel oil, its currency has difficulty in
rising to the parity of creditor-country
currencies backed strongly by gold.
And when “the American industrial
machine” begins “to pour out a torrent
of goods” its production problems would
seem to be largely finished, with the dollar
again in the ascendant. The London
cable is therefore self-contradictory as
well as generally debatable.
True, if inflation remains the problem,
a new price-level may be established in
the United States which may result in a
new gold value being placed on the
dollar. If in such a case the pound
sterling is able to “look the dollar in the
face at the old parity,” the old parity
by such a time may be meaningless.
Costs of production are ultimately set by
output per head, and it is low produc-
tion costs that promote exports and
strengthen an exchange rate. The United
States’ export troubles will arise if it
suffers a permanent inflation of internal
costs and prices and, for political or other
reasons, is unable to adjust its exchange
rate. That would provide Britain and
other competitors with an opportunity to
undercut U.S. export prices.
Some of the Chosen People of Aus-
tralia —the militant unionists—have been
hit by a boomerang, probably the first of
many such accidents in store. The Sea-
men’s Union persuaded the Federal Gov-
ernment to legislate so as to prohibit the
licensing of vessels on the Australian
coast that were more than 25 years old.
Now the Katoomba and three other
vessels are to leave Australia in foreign
ownership, and the maritime and water-
side unions see unemployment ahead. A
mixed variety of squeals is being heard
in Canberra. Without providing its own
services the Government, through Eddie
Ward, has prohibited private companies
employing vessels over 25 tons on the
Papuan coast. This has added to the
frustration that has descended upon New
Guinea producers since Canberra brought
the New Order to the Islands.

Total sales by the Disposals Com-
mission were given out last week as being
£55 million, of which £9 million was
placed on overseas markets. Before June
30 a total of £42 million was given. In
1944-45 the Commonwealth Government
claimed a revenue of only £2.6 million
from disposals, and in 1945-46 only £15.6
million, against a Budget estimate of £2B
million. The figures are all at odds with
each other, and require an official ex-
planation.

Compromise price-control, to which
President Truman is reported to have
agreed reluctantly, will be restored in the
United States during the next month. The
O.P.A. will then continue until June 30,
1947. President Truman desires more
comprehensive controls than those ac-
cepted by Congress.

The announcement of a 3d. increase in
the price to be paid in London for South
African gold, making it £8 12s. 6d. sterling
an ounce, drew attention to the apparent
premium being paid for the Rand prod-
duct. The fixed London gold price is £8
Bs. per fine ounce. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer said the higher price was
appropriate only to the special circum-
stances of South African gold, and had
“no significance in regard to our general
gold price or exchange-rate policy.” Dr.
Dalton’s explanation came in a period of
speculation on the probable course of
world exchange rates, particularly in view
of U.S. inflation, Canada’s dollar coming
to par with U.S. currency, and Sweden's
exchange action. It appears that Canada
made the maximum adjustment (10 p.c.)
that is allowed in exchange rates without
permission of the authorities set up under
the Bretton Woods Agreement. There is
speculation as to whether the United
States will have to ask permission to
adjust its exchange rate —something
scarcely contemplated when the agree-
ment was signed.

Mt. Isa, Queensland, is returning to
lead-silver-zinc production at an appro-
priate time. The co. sells its bullion over-
seas, and should get full world price for
its products, though taxes swallow a great
deal of the profit. Lead has risen to £55
sterling a ton in London and zinc to £49
55., as against £25 and £25 15s. for most
of the war period. Silver has had a
swift rise_ to 3s. Bd. sterling from the
war-time pegged price of 2s. Id., and a
rise in the U.S. price may force the
London figure higher. Mt. Isa board
decided to taper-off copper production
by March 1 last; since then a
long-term copper programme has been
laid down, involving the establishment of
a million-pound treatment plant. The
board will give the go-ahead signal
as soon as Britain, the U.S.A. and
Australia come to a reasonable agree-
ment on double-taxation abolition.
Peak annual production of Mount
Isa in the past has been upwards of
4,100,0000 z. silver, 48,000 tons lead and
30,000 tons spelter. War-time copper
production went as high as 10,500 tons
a year ; it is aimed eventually to lift this
output to at least 18,000 tons, which will
put it in front of Mt. Lyell as a producer.
The copper ore is high-grade. With ade-
quate coal supplies coming forward and
new plant operating, it is expected that, in
addition to the copper output, the co. will
turn out 2,775,0000 z. silver, 37,000 tons
lead and 24,000 tons zinc. With copper
and lead smelters operating simultane-
ously, the mine will need 9240 tons of
coal a month, against about 3600 tons
needed for lead-zinc operations alone.
Apparently the Queensland Government
has now guaranteed this amount from the
Collinsville coalmine. Shareholders in
Mt. Isa so far have had no return on
their money. The present represents a
long-awaited opportunity. Coal and taxes
are the snags now that prices are right.

The figures inserted at the back of the
printed copy of the Prime Minister’s
statement on Federal finances for 1945-46
give more detail than the speech reported
in the daily press. Even so it is not pos-
sible to gather a fair idea of what the
expenditure has been under any par-
ticular heading. Any or all expenditure
figures may be subject to a “miscell-
aneous credits” item amounting to £62
million —an astonishingly large item to
be allowed to go into the accounts as
“miscellaneous.” These credits also hap-
pen to be £37 million greater than the
Budget estimate; so far no explanation
has been offered as to the reason for the
increase.
In rough summary the last three years’
expenditure and revenue figures have
been as follows:
Expenditure.

The 1945-46 “war” figure of £378 million
will be increased to about £398 million
when Britain sends in a relevant account
for around £2O million. Also, there has
been deducted, in arriving at the £378
million, £15.6 million from disposals, the
£62 million of “miscellaneous credits”
already mentioned, and there has been
added £3.6 million net paid to “other
administrations.”
Ail these items require detailed explana-
tion. ' To begin with, the Budget esti-
mate of revenue from disposals was £2B
million. It was announced that up to
a date before June 30 this year actual
revenue from disposals exceeded £42 mil-
lion. Yet the figure given in the financial
records turns out to be only’ £15.6 mil-
lion, indicating that the Disposals Com-
mission has retained a huge sum of
money until after June 30, or that many
purchasers have not yet paid for their
goods, or that some revenue from dis-
posals has been offset separately against
special items of expenditure. The people
are entitled to know what has really
happened.
The debit of £3.6 million under the
heading “other administrations” calls
equally for elucidation. At the end of
March last Mr. Chifley announced that
£27.6 million had been received from the
British Government in payment for ser-
vices rendered previously (the Budget in-
ference was that the amount related to
1944-45 or earlier), and yet the year ended
with a debit of £3.6 million so far as
“other administrations” are concerned!
The Budget forecast a net credit of £2O
million, so the position generally is clear
as mud.
The monstrous item, “miscellaneous
credits, £62 million,” apparently includes
part of the £16.8 million received in
March from the Division of Import Pro-
curement by way of profits, from various
trust funds by way of repayment of
advances, and from the Disposals Com-
mission.
Before deduction of any “credits” the
year’s “war” expenditure is shown at
£452 million, against the publicised figure
of £378 million. Though little else may
be, it is perfectly clear that “war” last
year cost a great deal more than is openly
admitted by the Government, and that
it is cutting down “war” spending very
slowly. A great deal of this “war”
spending now has mainly a political signi-
ficance —for which the taxpayers shell out.
Bitumen and Oil Refineries (Aust.),
Ltd., recently issued 750,000 £1 ords, to
the public, which were rushed and sent
to a premium. California Texas Oil Co.,
an overseas concern, subscribed £500,000
in £1 ords. A £700,000 refinery is to be
erected at Matraville, in the Botany Bay
region of the Sydney metropolitan area,
and the prospectus estimated its profits
on the basis of an output of 50,000 tons
of bitumen, with additional lubricating
oils, petrol, etc. Now the Vacuum Oil
Co. is to spend £750,000 on an oil refinery
at Altona, Victoria, capable of treating
upwards of 15 million gallons of crude oil
annually. It is aimed to produce lubri-
cating oils in quantity, as well as “many
thousands of tons of asphalt, together
with several million gallons of motor-
spirit and Diesel fuel annually.” Bitu-
men and asphalt are related terms. If
other oil cos. set up Australian refineries
this country should become plentifully
supplied with bitumen.

The Taxpayers’ Association of Queens-
land produces a very good periodical,
“The Taxpayer,” a recent issue of which
gave a summary of the taxes imposed by
the Commonwealth (including the North-
ern Territory), the Australian States and
New Zealand. The information has been
checked by the various commissioners.;
Australians will be interested to know
that, in addition to income tax, they may
be subject to war-time (company) tax,
gold tax, flour tax, wool tax, payroll tax,
sales tax, land tax, estate and probate
duty, gift duty, annuity tax and enter-
tainments tax. Then there are stamp
duties. Taxpayers’ associations are obvi-
ously a necessity in our present-day exist-
ence.

“Blime”: “Hear about ol’ man
Hammer?” queried Ted, lining up along-
side. “Young Tack swallered a two bob
bit, an’ it’s wedged agen his lung, some-
how.” Charlie swung round, interested.
“That’s bad luck,” he nodded. “What’s
he done about it?” “Took the kid to the
bush nurse,” Ted explained, “an’ she
sent ’im into town t’ the doc. Doc. messed
round for a bit, then decided it was a
city job, so oT Hammer hired a car an’
took the youngster down.” “Three hun-
dred miles!” gasped Charlie. “What
erbout his cows?” “Missus is milkin’

reckons if he can’t shift the coin with
some long jiggers, he’ll ’ave t’ open up
young Tack.” “But them operations
costs pounds ,” reminded Charlie, “an’
they take time.” “Yair, I know. Then
there’s the hospital fees,” Ted continued,
“an’ board f’r. the old bloke, an’ fares.
Hammer’s gonna wait an’ bring the kid
back ’isself if the doc. gets it out.
And” “Aw, but, cripes, Ted, he’s

“Timothy Tywire”: Unable to buy his
wax matches in tins during the war,
many a bushman was deprived of a
useful emergency notebook. Often, at
the drafting gate, I’ve had to scratch the
tallies on a tin matchbox, transferring
them to the stock-book when I got back
to the homestead. Now that matches, as
well as matchboxes, are “light on,” there
should be a good market outback for a

“B. A. Ker”: Mention of dollar birds
(B. 26/6/’46) reawakens a poignant
memory. Some 27 years ago a colony of
the beautiful birds frequented a pictur-
esque spot on the banks of the Prospect
Creek, Fairfield (N.S.W.), till a “sports-
man” arrived with a pea-rifle. His
first shot brought a fine specimen
thudding to earth, squawking in
agony, and within a few minutes the
tops of the swamp-oaks were dotted with
sympathisers. The stranger licked his
chops and went to work systematically.
When the mob flew away he shook the
injured bird by the wing until its agonised
protests brought more victims to be
slaughtered. At last the action failed
to brine up more targets and, well pleased
with ms morning’s work, the hero
sauntered off, doubtless to enjoy a hearty
dinner. But 23 dollar birds lay dead or
dying on the pine needles (perhaps he
reasoned that the ants would finish the
job) while two little bedraggled bundles
floated on the surface to pollute the
“swimmin’ ’ole.” If that “sportsman” is
alive, and should see this it might give
him satisfaction to learn that dollar birds
have never bpen seen in that locality
since.

“Gravelsnatcher”: “Bughouse’s” theory
that Westralia’s saline areas derive from
the sea, the salt being driven inland as a
fine spray (B. 12/6/’46), may account for
those salt lakes that are so marked a
feature of the big State ; but it doesn’t
offer any explanation of the freshwater
lakes that occur, sometimes in the middle
of a chain of salt lakes, nor of the
vagaries of Westralia’s underground
streams. There are areas where any well
sunk to a certain depth may be relied
upon to supply fresh water, and others
where it would be useless to search for
water other than that possessing a high
saline or magnesia content. But there
are other districts in which, of half a
dozen wells sunk in a 100-acre paddock,
three might be fresh. Seems fairly
obvious that the fresh streams originate
in and pursue their devious course
through completely salt-free soil, while
the salt streams, at some stage in their
course, strike a seam of salt. Which sug-
gests, further, that there may be some
undiscovered rock salt deposits, or at least
that the saline goes deeper than “Bug-
house’s” theory.

“Mug Angler”; My opinion about
“educated” trout and other fish (B.
19/6/’46) is that they inform one another
about fish hooks and other things. For
I am long convinced that most fresh-
water and longshore fish know that there’s
a hook inside the bait just as “Alpine
Willie” knows there’s a bone in a chop.
This being so, Pisces’s game is to get the
tasty morsel off without being snagged
by the barbed point. Hiding the point
in the bait tricks him a little, since most
fish, except the English gudgeon, will
shy right away from a bait with the hook
showing. As for the passing of informa-
tion-well, at one time it was possible
at Mandurah (W.A.) to catch multitudes
of whiting with no more than a scrap
“ D'you get many flying-fish around here?”
of mullet, or of whiting itself. Then one
day a smart city bloke started using
prawn. And now they’ll bite at nothing
else, even fish coming in from the sea.

“E. 2”: Judging by country-newspaper
notices, many landowners are resorting to
the good old bluff “Trespassers will be
prosecuted” to keep trappers and others
from molesting their private stocks of
rabbits. I look forward to the day when
such a prosecution is launched, with, 1
hope, a claim for damages based on the
poaching of a number of rabbits. That
should make legal history. My prize so
far goes to a trapper working at the holes
in netting fences along farm boundaries.
By keeping his traps on the edge of
adjoining Crown lands he plays for safety
within the law, but his practice is not
recommended. Rabbit wars can be pretty
fierce.

“Alpine Willie”: Sounds of wagon-
wheels turning on dry axles are among
the strangest when heard in a deep, track-
less mountain gorge, so naturally pro-
duced that one can picture a string of
bullocks approaching slowly round the
bend with a wagon in tow. But the
rhythmic creaking is muted and does not
increase in volume. A careful search
reveals the wagon-wheel birds in the tops
of tall trees, performing usually at dusk
when the figures of the landscape, are
becoming dim and blurred. Any of the
larger dark shapes could then be a wagon
lumbering into sight,
* *• * *
“Lower Tops’l”: Years ago when the
skipper of our Bass Strait crayfishing
ketch told us boys that we could catch
quail by running them down on foot, we
just thought no more about it, for, be-
lieve me, that old Strait man could put
over stories! Then, one day while
weatherbound under Rhoden Island, off
the north end of Flinders Island, a school-
mate and myself went ashore for exer-
cise with the ship’s retriever. There,
among the low scrub on the small grassy
island, the myriad calls of quail were
like one prolonged whistle, and as we
walked through the low scrubby patches
the big brown Californian variety of the
ground-bird kept rising and going off
down-wind. We took off after one, and
on reaching the spot where it landed we
set it off in flight again. Sure enough —
as the skipper predicted—after three rises
and three landings the bird seemed too
knocked up to fly or run off quickly, so
that with the mong helping we caught the
feathered harrier, and later some others.
But for that sort of hunting you need to
be of schoolboy age and let loose from
imprisonment on a crayfish ketch.

“Horseless Horseman”: Foxes are
nearly as good as goannas at eating eggs.
Camped by a Murray billabong one
bright moonlight night, we watched a
Reynard from the hut window calmly in-
vestigating a freshwater turtle’s nest whose
incubation we had hoped to observe.
Nearly half an hour went by before my
mate, with a .44, knocked the burglar, a
mangy broken-mouthed warrior of doubt-
ful age. Then we found it had gorged
73 elongated eggs that we knew to be
underground there.
* * ♦ *
“Esk D.”: The bullock team, a strung-
out procession of baldies, brindles and
blacks, plods slowly along the muddy
bush track, hauling a heavy jinker on
which are two great logs. The wheels
sink deeper and deeper into the mud down
to the axles. The driver, a long, scrawny
fellow with a set of faded whiskers, urges
his bullocks on. They don’t budge an
inch. He paints a lurid picture of their
antecedents. They strain mightily but are
firmly anchored. The driver roars and
bellows, working up to a burst of pro-
fanity that curls like a whiplash about the
bullocks’ ears and scorches the leaves of
a near-by peppermint. An old white
cockatoo in the tree, rudely awakened,
yawns and blinks his eyes; then flaps
down to the wagon, hops up and down
on the log and screeches at the driver,
“Here, son, git outa the blasted road an’
let someone swear wot can swear!”

“Exmed”: I fancy I can cap “Gravel-
snatcher’s” instance of utter absurdity in
the climax of a short story (B. 19/6/’46)
with the bloke who, confined to a prison
cell, committed suicide by strangling him-
self with his own hands. An impossi-
bility, of course, since no matter how
determined the would-be shuffler-off
might be, no matter how firmly he might
grip his windpipe, even until conscious-
ness might lapse, immediately that passed
his grip would relax and breathing re-
assert itself again. Yet the yam appeared
in a popular magazine.

“Narrin”: The parson called at Jack-
son’s one afternoon and caught old
“Brumby” at home. “I was pleased to
see you at church last Sunday fortnight,”
the good man began as soon as Mrs. Jack-
son bustled out to fix up afternoon tea.
“I only wish you and your wife
could make the trip in more often.”
“Brumby” mumbled something about it
being a long way, and the parson tried
another tack. “Tell me, as man to man,
Mr. Jackson, just what you thought of
the sermon that night? It was chosen,
as you may have guessed, to point out
the lesson of obedience, of duty. In these
days of social irresponsibility I thought
the story of Isaac, or rather of Abraham,
particularly pointed. Now what do you
think?” “Flamin’ rot!” “Brumby” blurted
out. The parson raised an eyebrow. “I
beg your pardon” he began. “Aw-
right. Mister,” the old chap apologised,
“I’m sorry that come out. But y’ see I’d
bin havin’ trouble with me goats all the
week before. Yair; me goats. The
crawlin’, rotten —er, creatures’d bin inta
everythink on the place—the wife’s
garden, the stockyard, the crop, the fowl-
’ouse, me p’taters an’ the flamin’ washin’
on the line. They’d bin through every
fence on the place barrin’ the dawg-prpof
—they busted the barbwire t’ get inta the
crop an’ they climbed or jumped inta the
stack. So y’ see when y’ come t’ that part
in the sermon about a goat bein’ caught
be the horns in some blanky bushes—well,
I knew y’ was on t’ a flamin’ crook)
lay.” The parson’s looking for an erudite
rural person to edit his sermons now.
“X.E.D.”: We turned the mob of
woollies into a Murray bend to make
camp, and from a near-by humpy of bags
and rusted iron came a little wizened cove
to pay us a call. He was unremarkable
except that he wore a. brand-new pair
of trilbies at least four sizes too big for
him. After a while Sam broached the
subject, “Aw, them,” said the little cove.
“Well, it’s like this. I’m one o’ these
bloxes wot goes over on the heels pretty
bad, an’ 1 usen’t t’ be able t’ keep a pair
o’ boots more’n six munce. 1 git over
that now by buyin’ ’em extra big ; when
they start showin’ signs o’ wear 1 just
switch ’em t’ the other feet 1 ”
❖ * * *
“Colonial Cove”: “Gravelsnatcher”
(B. 19/6/’46) resurrects an ancient Wes-
tralian land regulation when he tells of
some of his former employers entering
private land to take away road-making
material. Here is the clause, “March 5,
1831, at the Court of St. James”:— “The
Crown reserves the right of making neces-
sary roads and bridges for public purposes,
and also such indigenous timber, stone
and other material the produce of the
land as may be required for the making
and the keeping of such roads and bridges
in repair and for any other public work.”
The signature attached to those regula-
tions is Lord Glenelg’s. Regarded by
modern generations as hidebound Tories,
Glenelg and many another statesman of
his time displayed no small amount of
wisdom in laying the foundations of the
Australian nation.

“Bob H.”: I’ve worked for cockies who
propped their fences up with sticks, and
even for one who sent me out to mend
sheep-netting with binder twine, but
recently I met the champ. “When you
get back from the siding,” the new boss
told me, “put the cart back in that gap
in the fence. And don’t be too long, or
the calves’ll get in and eat me cabbages 1 ”
* * * *
“Sou’-west”: Our Australian crayfish
has a crop, as anyone will realise on try-
ing to eat one taken straight from the
cray trap to the table. But how, being
without the claws of either the crab or the
lobster, does it manage to scratch so good
a living as to be described as “the most
abundant marine crayfish in the world”?
Of course, it is armed, as anyone will dis-
cover who gets a finger in the way of the
wildly flapping tail. But apart from that
and an armament of spikes on the cara-
pace it is no more than a glorified
prawn ; and like the prawn it lives largely
on a vegetable diet, though it will take
flesh with avidity when available. Its
vegetable diet accounts for the variation
in delicacy mentioned by “B. Rock,” since
seaweed varies also according to locality,
some being as delicate as lettuce, others
as coarse as kelp.
* * * *
“Wonk”: The easygoing down-country
buyer looked over the end pen at the sale-
yards, and nodded. “Good line,” he re-
marked to the local agent, “with the ex-
ception of about 30 that’d be no earthly
use to me. Even trucks too, with them
dropped.” “Owner’d prob’ly let ’em go,”
replied the agent. “If y’ decide on ’em
ask for a rejection soon’s they’re put up.”
The buyer agreed. He was propped on
the fence when, late in the afternoon, the
auctioneer reached the big mob.
“Twenty-eight, twenty-nine,” the voice
bawled. “Come on, gents, y’ know they’re
worth thirty-five. Twenty-nine . . .” The
agent glanced over where the down-
country bloke clung to the toprail and
grimaced at the sheep. “Twenty-nine,
I’ll take sixpence,” roared the auctioneer,
disgustedly. “What about it?” whispered
the agent, passing behind the big buyer.
The buyer raised his fists, beat the fence
a couple of times, and said nothing. The
agent passed on. “Going . . . gone,
came the voice, as the hammer banged.
The crowd began to move off, but for the
next few minutes the down-country bloke
remained on the fence. Presently, he
came to life. “N-now,” he bellowed,
“Where’s the flamin’ kid that gimme that
double mouthful o’ stickjaw toffee?”
THE LYREBIRD.
Where fragrant vintage flows and fills
The airy cellars of the hills,
The lyrebird has his mountain glade.
There he moves, a shade in shade,
And pilfers from unwitting throats
Many a singer’s native notes,
But always, for he scorns to hoard,
The notes upon the air are poured.
If so he wills, he’ll mime and dance;
And sometimes, like an elfin lance,
A sunbeam pierces shade to smite
Silver, bronze and spraying white
Where rich and proud his fail is spread
In feathery foam about his head.
And should you be twice-blessed, you may
When winter yields to night a day
Hear, rising from a gullied sea
Of moonlit mist, rare purity; —
A twice-bom radiance, glowing gold,
Illumining that sea so cold.
Then you may say “tb p grey thrush sings,”
But it’s the lyrebird i n who brings
Those notes of music warm and rare
To light with gold the shrouded air.
Thrush, grey thrush, are you asleep,
Or do you careful vigil keep
Lest you should miss one lovely note
Raying from the pilferer’s throat?
The singer of that silent sea
Extolled your gentle artistry.;
The lyrebird pays you now full toll
For notes that he so subtly stole.
VICTORIA.

“Bo”: With torrential rain falling and
flood warnings coming over the radio,
Thrussell shifted everything in the house
that he could move to the fodder barn,
ending by putting the family up on the
racks. There they were rescued around
noon that day by the trooper in a boat.
Thrussell, however, wouldn’t go ; he in-
sisted he was safe: the weather was mild
and he’d had a long experience of floods.
Towards mid-afternoon, relaxing after a
laborious half-hour of trying to skull-
drag a cranky sow on to a shelf, he
observed with curiosity something that
came bobbing towards the barn. A keg!
As a swirling eddy threatened to carry it
away again he got a stick and edged it in.
Within a few seconds he had the thick
cork out of the bunghole. Whisky! He
gazed whence it had come, and recalled a
township tale that someone out along the
river was running a still. So it was that
sly old cow Moody! Well, it was the
first thing he’d ever got for nothing from
his neighbor. Not bad whisky the old
soanso made, either. Just on dusk there
came the splash of oars, and out of the
gloom a voice roared “Are you there,
Ben?” Thrussell was standing up to his
waist in water, one arm clutched lovingly
around the keg. “Wash thish?” he said,
peering out into the waste of waters.
“Boatsh goin’ up an’ down river all day
like blashted regatta! It’sh a flamin’ con-
spir’shy to muck up the besh flood a man
ever enjoyed!”

“Dusty Gully”: “One of me best
milkers went orf on the mornin’ milkin’,”
said Bert. “She gave jist as much at the
evenin’ though. Couldn’t make it out at
all, seein’ as I was runnin’ the herd in the
paddick with the ’roo-proof fence at
night. But early one momin’ I spotted
a big doe bounce up t’ the fence, grab a
joey from her pouch by the scruff of the
neck an’ toss him over. Joey makes a
beeline f’r Strawb. an’ goes t’ work on
her bowser. Had me beat f’r a while
how he got out of the paddick; but he
bailed Strawb. up agen the nettin’, hopped
on her back an’ hurdled the top wire.”

“Old-timer”: Jimmy Noddy, outward-
bound from Barham with a load of chaff
for Noorong, had dinner at the Thule
turn-off and then headed his team past
Whymoul. There was a patch of heavy
sand there and Jim’s German wagon
stuck in it. It was a hot, blinding day
and the six horses, after vainly struggling
to shift the load and having their ears
bashed by Jimmy’s language, turned it
up. Jimmy drew off, dropped his whip,
wiped his brow and looked hopelessly
“ Careful, Jock — I forgot to bring a pressure-gauge."
about. His eye lighted on a long indivi-
dual sitting in the shade of a Murray
pine and regarding him humorously,
whereupon James went to town properly,
winding up with “An’ y’ could flamin’
well sit there an’ watch a man strugglin’
an’—an’—not lift a finger!” The stranger
scratched his head. “Well,” he said,
“what could I do? I ain’t Samson—l

could I? An’ you was doin’ enough
veilin’ for everybody.” Silence, while
Jimmy reflected that the man was right,
and that what he needed was four more
horses The stranger elevated himself and
added, slowly, “Still, me dawg might

shade beyond him emerged a blue heeler,
head cocked on one side, tail poised for
action. “Get under there, Bluey, ordered
the long bloke. To Noddy he said Stand
y’r nags inter their collars.” This done,
there was a short whistle and a blue
shadow at once went for the heels of the
shatters. The wagon came out of the
sand on the run.

“Ex-C.G.”; Can’t swear to details, but
have a clear memory of a man with his
right arm in a sling being held in the
pub at Lascelles (Vic.), then known as
Minapre, while a doctor raced up from
Woomelang, seven miles away. The
victim was said to have been found hang-
ing from a shell-parrot’s hole (B.
10/7/’46) in a bull mallee hollow out on
the Hopetoun-road, where he was found
on the point*of unconsciousness by a
travelling jeweller. That was in 1913.

“X.E.D.”: The aboriginals were no-
mads of the plains and rivers. Their relics,
principally the great cooking ovens, be-
come noticeably fewer as the foothills rise
up to the mountains. Perhaps it’s not hard
to understand when game, never come by
easily, had all the advantages of deep
scrub and rugged slopes. Prospects in
living off the land in mountain country,
even where still in its primitive state, are
pretty slim, and the abo. didn’t develop a
passion for mountaineering.

“Zake”: As old Tom Kavanagh
chugged in and made wide sweep of
Runnenbrumby’s only street in his bat-
tered T-model a brown cattle-dog, the
only living thing in sight, got up from a
roll in the dust, shook himself, yawned
and looked with idle curiosity at the
disturber of his pleasure. Tom jerked
to a stop outside the store. Then he got
out, took a length of No. 8 fencing wire
from the back, looped one end of it
around the steering wheel and gave it
several twists. Then he took the other
end and did the same with it around one
of the store’s verandah posts. After that
he jacked the back axle off the ground
and removed one of the wheels. As he
was about to roll the wheel before him
into the store he caught sight of Joe
Hallett, the paling-splitter, leaning against
the store rolling a cigarette. Tom jerked
his thumb over his shoulder back at the
car. “Had a letter yesterdee from me
brother Eric wot lives down in Sydney,”
he drawled. “He was tellin’ me he had
his car swiped an’ w’en he got it back
it corst ’im a Tmdred quid to replace wot
they stripped it of. Well, I can’t afford
to spar up no ’undred smackers if they
’alf-inch mine. An’ if ’e’d’ve taken the
simple precautions I’ve just took ’e’d’ve
bin that much in pocket now!”

“Mat’s Mate”: Shortly after “Kicker”
joined us on the track north through
western Riverina, we discovered that,
given a small camp-oven, an egg, flour,
sugar, baking-powder and some box bark,
he could turn out rock cakes that were
poems of lightness and taste. Mat, who
had a passion for the things, would gather
the box bark every night, get a fire going,
put the little oven on and wait upon
“Kicker” hand and foot till the batch
was turned out, “Kicker” got tired of it.
“Gripes,” he demanded, “can’t y’ eat
somethin’ else for a change?” But Mat
was insatiable. “Kicker” became very
cheerful after he’d baked a batch near
Mathoura. “Well,” he said, “we’ll be
headin’ out on t’ the plains tomorrer an’
there’ll be no more rockies.” Mat was
startled. “Yair,” said “Kicker,” waving
a hand at the north, “ain’t no trees out
there for thousings o’ miles.” Mat wanted
to turn back, but I reminded him of the
contract we had at Pretty Pine and he
subsided, sunk in gloom. After we’d
gone to bunk I noticed him going off
into the darkness but thought little of it.
Next morning Mat was up and had his
swag rolled first and presently we were
away. We got a lift for a few miles and
that night camped by a windmill some-
where short of Deniliquin. Mat, humming
to himself, got out the camp-oven and
said, “Come on, ‘Kicker,’ hop in to y’r
mixin’.” Then from his swag he pro-
duced an armful of box bark. “Yair,”
“That Was a lucky break. Jack— they were gaining on us."
he grinned, “got enough last night t’ do
us three days. That orter get us to
Pretty Pine.” “Kicker’s” language itself
was hot enough to bake the cakes.

“Old Camp”: In the early Coolgardie
days there were not a few cases of men
perished in the wilds and their bodies
eaten by the wild dogs. The most not-
able was that of young Rason, who, with
his father, located Rason’s Find, a rich
patch of the first Coolgardie years. Out
prospecting later young Rason was listed
as missing. Ultimately his bones were
found far out, gnawed by dogs and
identifiable only by papers found in the
tom garments lying near by. Cases were
also known where the dogs disinterred
bodies buried at a shallow depth. That
was why, when burying a deceased mate
far out, Westralian bushmen invariably
covered the grave with big stones.
* * * *
“Nor’-west”: I liked “Propalong’s”
note (B. 19/6/’46) about Toos on a hot
day being always in the shade of a bush
or rock and almost always flat out. Hoof-
ing it from Maud Landing on the rim of
the Indian Ocean to Giralia at the head of
Exmouth Gulf, a trifle of some 60 miles,
we did long, just occasionally, to rest in
the shade of a bush or a big rock. Both
were there and invitingly cool. But the
’roos had always been there before us,
and not only was there the mild aroma
of buck marsupial, which we might have
borne, but every stem of grass was literally
crowded with kangaroo tick.
“Rank-and-Filer”: The usual “swi”
game was in progress under the big ti-
tree on the river bank. Pompey, the flash
boong, held the kip and was just about
to toss the pennies when some honest
soul whispered, “You can’t head em,
they’ve rung a double-tailer in on y.
Pompey paused long enough to remark,
“Oh! well, up she goes. By cripe, a man
might fluke ’em!” And up they went.
* * * *
“Chuck”: While his nag finished its
feed, “Bunt” propped himself on a comer
of the stable and idly surveyed a row of
cabbages in the pub garden. Presently
from the kitchen door came Charlie ;
he waddled to the woodheap, picked up
the axe, seated himself on a root end, and
addressed the heap. “Y’ git tougher ev ry
day,” he told the logs complamingly.
“Ain’t one o’ y’ decent enough t split
easy. Man oughter chuck y’ over the
bank.” He was still holding forth when
“Rickety” emerged from behind the shop
next door and approached his own wood-
pile. “Y* know, there’s blokes m this
town don’t pay their flamin bills, e
explained to the lengths of grey
“But don’t you get away with ? the idea
they’ll beat me. I bet I’ll fix em. Bunt
listened for a minute, then his eye came
back to where Charlie was pointing out
its errors to the pub logs. Starve the
flamin’ magpies,” he gasped to the cab-
bages, “them two mus’ be goin dippy.
Listen, will y’? Pair o’ barmy coots is
talkin’ t’ a coupla wood-’eaps.”

“D.R.H.”: If instead of the a
few specimens of “Gravelsnatcher s
super-mongrel (B. 3/ 7 / ’46) had been in-
troduced into Australia in the very vague
past the result would have been very dif-
ferent from “G.’s” optimistic imaginings.
Leaving the boongs out of the picture,
we would have had in the arena a few
very primitive herbivorous animals
matched against a hound “able to pull
down the fastest ’roo that runs” and to
“overtake the emu.” The contest might
have had several outcomes: the marsu-
pials could have been wiped out quickly,
the mongs following them to extinction,
Or the larger fauna could have become so
scarce that only a few of the smaller and
more easily filled dogs—the outcasts and
scavengers, accustomed to picking up
carrion and lizards and such small game
—would have hung on. In other words,
the only dogs that would have lived to
breed would have been the culls, which
means that in a few generations the breed
would have gone back to something very
different from “G.’s” magnificent proto-
sausage. Again, if the numbers of the
dogs were at first very small and the
kangaroo count very large the curs might,
through sheer easy living, have become
slow and relatively inoffensive —'Which is
probably what has happened to the
“cowardly” dingo. It’s wise to remember
that any radical destruction of a natural
balance can react as strongly against the
stronger side as against the weaker. De-
generation is just as much a part of
Nature’s scheme as is progress. And if
you make things too easy for any group
of animals the results are likely to be
disastrous for that group. There’s a moral
in it for any vote-chasing politician who
may have retained the vestiges of a con-
science.

“Frank Mauri”: Pacific native forms
of sorcery, puri-puri and draunikau, vary
in their application and effects. The in-
cantations of kena leka must be made by
moonlight. To perform the tei nia the
sorcerer pours the kava on the grave of
one of the victim’s ancestors and plants
a coconut in the wet soil. When the
coconut sprouts the tevoro comes up and
the victim dies.

Before river banks were torn
and trampled by the hoofs of cattle, and
silted up as a corollary, one could often
see shoals of fish, arranged in assorted
sizes in the limpid depths. Scattered
about the sandy bed and among the snags
were large circular mounds of leaves,
from inside which occasionally a lithe,
sinuous shape shot at a passing shoal,
which quickly dissipated in silvery frag-
ments. Foiled, the robber eel would swirl
to the hollow opening of a snag, from
which projected waving whiskers adorn-
ing a horny head armed with an evil
triangle of spikes behind the helmet.
Gaining a nose hold the squirming eel
would tug furiously, while the jewfish,
sticking spikes into the snag, battled tor
life, in the end to be dragged out and
carried to the dining-room, whence rose
a maelstrom of leafy furniture. Odd fish
with torn noses, streaked backs and
chewed tails flaunted narrow squeaks.
Two eels would often cut out and corner
a jewey, one dining with gusto while the
other nudged hungrily.

“Fang”: “Queerest cove I ever struck
was Larry of the Bend,” said Barkley.
“Called hisself a stoodent of the pisca-
torial population of the Murray. Hes
camped in a shack of logs an rusted
iron in his fav’rite bend, an’ one day he
walks, fully-dressed, on to the end or a
log, lights his pipe an’ dives in feet first.
Well, he doesn’t show up in five minutes,
so we peel orf an’ start divin’. We find
him at the bottom, his pipe goin mil

OLD MAN MURRAY.
N.S.W.
When the night-clouds hurry
And the winds are high
Old Man Murray
Rolls serenely by—
Dark the river village,
Bright the lighted town,
Dim the fields of tillage,
Wide the pastures brown.
Somewhere in the snowlands
He began to flow.
Through the level lowlands
Wide his waters go,
Like a living, dumb thing
No man may control,
Yet alive! with something
Like a human soul—
Something that is kindly,
Strong and deep and true.
Steadfastly, if blindly,
Night’s long darkness through,
Silent, almost holy,
Deep with destiny,
Goes the Murray slowly
Rolling to the sea.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DONT WORRY IMSENDINGIT TO
GRAZCOS."
Wool Prices.
“Graz”: In addition to appraisement
prices to growers the Wool Commission
has used a table of export issue prices
for wool sold on foreign account and the
wool content in textiles exported,
the average rate for which has been
14.52d. (stg.). The Australian equivalent
(18.15d.) is now to be used as the basis
for appraised reserves when auctions are
resumed. An administrative charge of
,91d. is to be deducted, giving growers a
minimum average return of 17.24d. per
pound. At auctions high-yielding, free
or near-free merino wools are likely to
fetch prices appreciably higher than the
reserves. Better-class full-woolled sheep-
skins have shot up from lid. to 17|d.
since the pegged price was lifted.
The table of limits is being adjusted
to conform to anticipated demands for
the various lines, and although the basic
rate has been raised 1.79d. reserves for
faulty merino and coarse crossbred might
be valued lower than under the war-time
appraisements. Including the flat rate
paid by Britain (J5.5d.) and subsequent
dividends from B.A.W.R.A. the carry-
over wool from the 1914-18 war-time
purchase scheme netted an average (price
of 19.19d. (stg.) to growers. The present
average reserve price is 4.67d. (stg.), or
nearly 6d. (Aust.) less than final
B.A.W.R.A. realisations. In view of
higher costs for shearing, freights, wages
and materials the reserves now being
fixed are not too high.
Commercial Fleece.
“Murrawong”: Cootamundra Show
Society’s competition, one of the most
useful and instructive of its kind, to foster
the production of merino fleeces of high
commercial value, invites competitors to
submit five wethers, bred by the entrant,
shorn under supervision on the same day
and run together in the same paddock
without handfeeding for a year after-
wards. Then each entrant selects three
of his five and all the sheep are machine-
shorn —again under supervision. Fleeces
are skirted and the fleece, broken pieces,
bellies, locks and stained pieces are care-
fully weighed and valued. The trophy
goes to the highest aggregate wool return.
On 1/7/’46 the 15 pens for the 1945 46
competition were shorn at Landgrove,
Cootamundra, where they had been pas-
tured for the year. The sheep included
every type of merino from extra strong
to superfine, which added to the interest
and value of the competition.
As all the wool was grown under*
identical conditions percentage of vege-
table matter was even, and light skirting
was done to render fleeces free. There
was some variation in proportion of fleece
to skirtings according to the extent or
lack of covering on the points* but on
the average the skirted fleece comprised
60 to 70 p.c. of the total weight. An in-
teresting point was the variation in fleece
condition It might have been imagined
that sheep under identical conditions and
on similar feed would have been even, but
this wasn’t so and proves how strong a
factor is breeding.
The competition was won by Merry-
ville, Yass, whose three wethers cut
fleeces of an aggregate value of £3 19s. s|d.
Second prize went to N. Milson, Laver-
stdek, Yass, with a total of £3 12s. 3d. for
his three best fleeces. Merryville was
third. Some remarkably good weights
were cut, three skirted fleeces turning the
scales at 121 b. and over. The first five
places were filled by wethers producing a
fleece of 70-74’s quality.
In future each entrant will be limited
to one pen of wethers. Other districts
could run similar competitions, and the
idea might be given a wider application
by the R.A.S., or the Sheepbreeders’
Association. Fleece competitions at
present attract entries produced under a
wide variety of conditions. There is no
control over feeding, which is admittedly
responsible for most of the weight and
growth of the fleece, whereas under
Cootamundra conditions there is no
chance of ringing-in and all sheep grow
their fleeces under identical circumstances.
Statistics of the Cootamundra competi-
tion would help to solve many arguments
on comparative weights and value of
fleece, skirtings and other bddments.
Japan as a Meat Market.
“Alpha”: Immediately following World
War I beef cattle soared to record prices.
I remember West Queensland bullocks
selling for £3O to £4O a head on the
Sydney market. In two or three years
prices slumped and Australian cattlemen
“It’s a sure sign of ’eavy rain.”
had a lean time for about 12 years. With
the lifting of the depression, a favorable
Empire meat agreement, better chilling
processes and the Blue Star line of
steamers coming on the Australian run
with larger space for chilled beef, the
export meat trade revived ; cattlemen
began to make up leeway and reduce
their overdrafts. At present, it is easy
to sell beef to hungry nations, but taking
the long view keen competition will come
again on the Smithfield market.
Australian meat men would be wise to
look around for new and supplementary
beef markets. The Japs eat little meat
now because they have little. There are
in Japan- only 11 sheep per 100,000 and
25 cattle per 1000 in the four main islands.
The basic diet is fish and rice, but the
Japs who worked in the pearling in North
Australia before the war appreciated
meat, though they were not the big meat-
eaters we are, and still availed themselves
of fish, dugong and turtle.
As soon as trading conditions with the
Orient become somewhat normal Aus-
tralian meat interests might consider
Japan as a potential market for tinned
and/or chilled meat. Something would
have to be spent on advertising and in
making trade connections. Apart from
purely Japanese consumers there will be
thousands of European meat-eaters either
in or passing through Japan who alone
will represent a considerable meat market.
Fallowing.
“Hux”: Fallow is a form of insurance
for a good wheat crop. Properly done,
moisture is conserved in the soil and sub-
soil for eight, 10, even 12 months ; evapo-
ration losses are light. There’s a right
time £or it. In southern parts ploughing
should be ahead of winter rains. The
soil is then at its highest point of absorb-
ency when they come. Moisture is held
through the summer till the wheat is
sown in April or May. In areas depen-
dent on erratic summer, rains fallowing
can begin as soon as possible after sow-
ing. Left till later, the land is too hard
for ploughing, the job is put off till
autumn and the seed is late going in.
Where heavy rains can be counted on
to compact the soil, plough to a depth of
4in. to 5in. so that weed growth is buried
and air and moisture can penetrate easily.
In other areas, the lower the rainfall the
shallower should be the ploughing. Don’t
plough for successive years at the same
depth, it leads to formation of a hard
pan. Variance of half an inch will fore-
stall that. Ploughing done one season
from north to south should next year be
east to west to prevent deep furrowing.
In summer working of the fallow take
good care to preserve the surface mulch.
This is a layer of loose dry soil—clods
plus soil particles—from to 3m.
deep. In well-fallowed lands, firmed by
rains and stock, the mulch is compacted
and reduced to 2in. by sowing time.
Moisture and soluble plant food content
is then high for the young wheat.
Most farmers work the fallow first with
the harrows and follow up with the
springtooth cultivator to the depth of the
first ploughing. This brings the clods to
the surface, sifts the fine soil to the
bottom and forms a 2in. layer of finely-
divided soil that clings to the subsoil.
Since delay in mulching the surface in the
spring results in loss of moisture, culti-
vation should be done in minimum time.
In subsequent cultivations stir the soil
mulch only, keep it in a loose condition
and weed-free. If implements are not
regulated to work uniformly at the right
depth, seed-bed is loose and dries out
quickly, normal growth is impossible,
plants are weakly and susceptible to fungi,
take-all, footrot, etc.
Fertilisers and Compost.
“Bill C”: When I started using the
“new” artificial fertilisers many years ago
my neighbors said I’d ruin my land in
a few years. That land is still far from
ruined, and I’ve seen the sceptics turn
wholeheartedly to fertilisers ; most of 'em
use much more of it than me.
Fertilisers make crops move; crops
must move to combat weed-growth, resist
insect pests, to return the farmer a profit.
The slower their growth the more likeli-
hood there is of something skittling ’em

TERRACING MACHINES
WITH A FUTURE!
With erosion a major problem through-
out Australia’s food-producing areas, the
post-war years will call for large-scale soil
conservation projects. Terracing will call
for "Caterpillar” Diesel Motor Graders,
such as the "212,” which has proved able
to build up to 700 feet of completed
terrace per hour. This machine can move
itself from district to district on any kind
of road at 10 to 15 miles per hour, bring-
mg to terrace-building all the "Caterpillar”
advantages which have so transformed
road-building and maintenance practices
(and costs!). Larger models of the "Cater-
pillar” Motor Grader, such as the No. 12
and the No. 112, have an even greater
earth-moving capacity, and will bring to
the biggest soil conservation projects new
speed and economy under a wide range of

The color put into the foliage of let-
tuce plants, the growth produced in the
latter by doses of nitrate of soda or sul-
phate of ammonia, cannot be achieved by
doses of compost manures. Gardeners
who are not aware of this can prove it
by experimenting. Compost is not to be
compared with artificial fertiliser where
pushing crops forward is the job. Win e
compost puts life into the soil, fertiliser
goes straight to work on the plants and
builds 'em up. The future of agriculture
is bound up with fertilisers and compost
—not with compost alone.
Scientmc Manuring.
“Plane Creek”lnstead of spreading
your ration of artificial fertiliser over all
your acres, manure your neediest pad-
docks and leave the others. A little fer-
tiliser is worse than none at all, because
it stimulates weed growth without
materially assisting the crop for which it
is intended. Or manure your rich soils
freely and let the poor ones go, concen-
trating on making a few acres produce
maximum crops.
Use fertilisers scientifically. Root and
tuber crops —carrots, turnips and spuds
dote on potassic manures. Use sulphate
and muriate of potash or kainit. Ashes
obtained by the burning of timber or
animal and vegetable refuse of any sort
should be used as a rich source of potash.
Tomatoes, beans and other plants
which fruit above ground need phosphatic
manures. For them there is nothing
better than bonedust or superphosphate
of lime. Nitrogenous fertilisers are for
greens. Two good ones are sulphate of
ammonia and nitrate of soda. Used too
freely in dry weather, these powerful fer-
tilisers may destroy plant life. All ani-
mal and bird manures and vegetable
refuse contain nitrogen as well as other
necessary plant foods.
Hints for the Farm.
“E.M.R.”: There is a fairly common
belief that a heifer showing a low test
as a two-year-old may improve as she
matures. Experiments show otherwise.
As the cow ages there is a gradual de-
crease in the constituents of milk except
albumen, which increases slightly from
year to year. Richness of milk is a
matter of inheritance; therefore it is
cheaper in the long run to breed from
the best butterfat producers than to try
to build up a herd from any old cows.
“Billjim”: There are three, causes of
paralysis in young pigs—injury, constipa-
tion (for which castor oil or Epsom salts
is effective) and nutritional lack, which
affects pigs of weening age. The last-
named is caused by a lack of green feed,
which is essential where the pigs are
confined. Often paralysis occurs through
lack of lime in cereals. Good results fol-
low an addition of 1 p.c. slaked lime to
the ration.
“Marsh”: It’s risky placing sheep in the
hospital paddock that are suffering from
contagious disease; it’s safer to sub-
divide and have an isolation paddock.
Suspicious cases should be drafted out
and placed in isolation as soon as the
ailment is detected.
“F.L.”: Comparative returns from
rabbit carcasses and skins in this Vic.
district favor the latter. Carcasses this
season were selling at 3s. a pair, but some
trappers held off for skin prices. By
the time they sold, carcasses were up to
3s. sd. a pair, but skins, averaging less
than seven to the pound, sold at an all-
round price of 11s. 6d. a pound. Both
are collected on regular rounds, and there
is no local market for skinned rabbits.
There is an opportunity for buyers able
to market carcasses minus skins, for tons
are thrown away.
Black spot in citrus is caused
by a fungus (Phoma citricarpa) ; the most
effective control is a Bordeaux mix-
ture (3-2-40) to which 1 p.c. spraying oil
well emulsified in twice its own volume of
water has been added as a spreader. Do
the first spraying when about half the
blossom has fallen, and the second one
about two months later, if the citrus are
growing under Queensland conditions.
“Rhode Is.”: Contrary to usual belief,
chickens of from two to three days old
should be given all scraps of bones, such
as remains of grilled chops, shoulder joint
bone, etc. Picking the bones gives chicks
the small amount of meat necessary to
young birds and definitely helps to
strengthen the beaks. The earlier these
bones are given to the chicks the better.
“Big Billy”: Vine erinose is caused by
a small mite which, in the growing season,
causes raised areas on the surface of vine
leaves. Under the surface these areas
are covered with a dense hairy growth.
The mite, which overwinters under the
bud scales, may be controlled by spray-
ing with lime sulphur, one in ten, during
the dormant period.

PROTECTION
when your
family will
need it
most
Life Assurance is a co-operative plan by which
men and women make certain that money will
be available when it is needed most.
Through Life Assurance a
man can provide security for
his wife and family. He can
ensure that they will have
the money with which to
carry on should he not live
so long as he expects.
Even more. Through Life
Assurance a man can not
only provide for his family's
security, but he can provide
for his own old age.
But more than that. Much
more than that. Through
Life Assurance a man can
so build up his financial
strength that he will be able
to seize on opportunities as
they come along.
All these benefits are within
the grasp of every man who
co-operates with his fellow
citizens in Life Assurance.
Through such co-operation
many things can be done
that a man could not do
by himself.
To provide protection
money—when it is needed
most that is the whole
idea of Life Assurance.

Labour politicians who talk glibly about
the importance of markets have permitted
Communist controlled unions to destroy
our trade with the Netherland Indies and
seriously threaten the development of
Australian exports to China, Malaya and
India.
The Communist Party defies both the
Federal Government and the A.L.P. and
prevents Australian goods from reaching
those markets. There, competing foreign
countries are already establishing them-
selves firmly.
Trade Union leaders , have repeatedly

“Oh, are you? Well, I’ve got the
sandwiches in my rucksack. So catch
me if you can!” And laughing a high,
unexpected shrill laugh, Miss Perrott runs
at Mount Wombat.
Silent, angry, sweating, billy waving in
one hand, stick in the other, Mrs.
Rollings flounders after her. The slope
is treacherous with shale: it is steep as
a precipice. The cicadas have all gone
silent. There is no air. Mrs. Rollings is
muttering to herself, sweating and gasp-
ing and muttering. “I shouldn’t have
come. There’s something funny about
her. She’s queer. And Ted will be down
at the crossing. We won’t be there.”
No, we are here, struggling for a foot-
hold in the shale, struggling for breath.
Struggling to catch up to Miss Perrott.
Alone. Alone. In the vast bush. On the
vast mountainside. Under the gigantic
white clouds. “My heart. My heart! ”
Mrs. Rollings is sobbing. “I can’t go
on.” Mrs. Rollings is stumbling, falling.
The billy goes rolling down the slope.
When it bangs to rest against the big
stone out pours the water.
Mrs. Rollings lies still, spread out on
the precipitous shale, gasping.
It is now that old man Mount Wombat
speaks his mind; a low, stony grumble.
Thunder! Mrs. Rollings sits up. A dark
purple hand with its fingers outstretched
is brandished between the cumulus and
the mountain.
IF there is really a wombat on this
A mountain it is a back view of Mrs.
Rollings as she toils up the last
hundred yards to the top: curved, squat,
dressed in brown, grunting. But a wild,
a tragic, a mad wombat crowned with
wild flowers as, speechless with woe and
labor, she exhibits to Miss Perrott her dis-
hevelled hair and red and tear-stained face.
For one moment she sees Miss Perrott
transfigured. There is a “trig station,” a
cairn of stones surmounted by a sort of
weather-vane of tin, perforated by pea-
rifle bullets and scored with the names
of tourists, on the topmost pinnacle of
Mount Wombat, and mounted upon the
cairn, one arm round the pole of the tin
contraption and the other stretched out
to embrace infinity, triumphant stands the
schoolmistress. Her cane of willow points
at ridge upon ridge of wilderness, menac-
ing under a rolling and ragged sky.
“Ah!” cries Miss Perrott. “So you got
here! Look at it! Look!” With a
sweep of her cane she presents to Mrs.
Rollings the wide and tremendous world.
“I dropped the billy,” says Mrs.
Rollings. Her underlip quivers.
Such a rage bursts in Miss Perrott’s
soul that she leaps down from the cairn
on the mountain-top and shakes Mrs.
Rollings by the shoulder. “Oh, you
idiot!” she shrieks. “What do I care
about the billy! You follow me up here
blubbering. You”
Thunder crashes. Heavy drops of rain.
And another long furious cannonade.
“Run!” says Mrs. Rollings. “The rain.”
She tries to wrench herself away from
Miss Perrott, but the lean claw grips her
shoulder. Now the rain is pelting down.
“I shouldn’t have come. I knew it. He’ll
get wet through at the crossing.”
This imbecility! Miss Perrott wrestles
with her, panting. “All right! I’ll let
you go. But you mustn’t run.”
“Let me go, let me go ! t ” The rain blots
out the world. Their clothes are sopping.
Below them, between the trees, greyness.
A wrench, a lurch and the human wom-
bat is free. A slithering, a squelching and
a crashing and Mrs. Rollings is on her
way down the mountainside. It is Miss
Perrott who scurries now to keep up, a
little nervous of being left alone in the
universe of rain and thunder; it is Miss
Perrott who glances at the dripping trees
to make sure they do not fall on her
iron-grey head. Yes, indeed, she remem-
bers that fallen log. Did she pass to the
left or the right of it on the way up?
Ah, a dear friend —the blackened billy
that Mrs. Rollings dropped. Miss Perrott
stoops to pick it up, then leaves it to lie
in the rain. Perhaps it would attract the
lightning.
Miss Perrott is not herself. But neither
is the billy—so cold and black and wet.
And neither is the world, whose sky is
water and lightning, whose red earth is
mud, whose stones quiver with thunder.
And the green knoll where all the ridges
meet, that is not quite itself either; it is
a vast flat plain of nothingness, swathed
in grey veils.
If there is warmth and comfort, it is
where dear Mrs. Wombat stands with
heaving bosom under a gum-tree. “Well,”
laughs dear Mrs. Wombat, upon whose
dank brown hair the glistening clematis
now looks like a native growth, “I never
thought I could come down a hill so fast.
I’m all right going down, aren’t I!” She
tastes the rain on her lip.
“Now, yes. We came up that way,”
says Miss Perrott, looking sharply in
several directions. “We might as well eat
our sandwiches till the rain clears.” She
leans her stick against the tree-trunk and
unships her rucksack. “I’m afraid they’re
sodden. Still, they’ll keep our strength up.”
“Funny,” says Mrs. Rollings, “I feel as
strong as a horse.”
A tomato sandwich that has spent a
day in a rucksack is not at any time a
particularly desirable sort of fodder. A
stale and wet tomato sandwich is dis-
gusting. Miss Perrott nibbles warily.
“Which way,” asks Mrs. Rollings,
happily munching, “do you think die
boarding-house is?”
“Er, over there,” says Miss Perrott.
“Over there, isn’t it?” says Mrs.
Rollings.
“It’s a bit hard to tell in the rain,” re-
marks Miss Perrott with a titter.
“You don’t mean to say you’ve lost
your sense of direction?” Great amuse-
ment.
“Oh, no.”
Mrs, Rollings no longer feels quite as
strong as a horse, “Which way is the
boarding-house, then? Which way is the
track we came?” She feels as weak as
a foal.
“Oh, don’t keep asking me which way
everything is! Find out for yourself if
you’re so keen about it.”
“But it’s getting late. It’s dark already
with the rain.”
The thunder has ceased. The down-
pour continues. What a peculiar tapping
it makes. Tap. Tap. Tap.
But that is not the noise of rain. What
taps? And all around Mrs. Rollings is
the darkening, lonely bush.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
Mrs. Rollings peers round the side of
the tree-trunk. There, at the foot of the
tree, is some horrible, yellowish, hairy
creature, like a mass of clammy fingers—
tap, tap, tapping on the ground. It is
there! That is it! The Horror!
Mrs. Rollings gives a scream and runs
blundering off into the bush.
4 4 P\ AMN you! ” shouts Miss Perrott
in a big voice like a man’s. She
snatches up her rucksack in one hand, her
stick in the other, and with the leap of a
tigress she flies at Mrs. Rollings. Whack
goes her thin stick on those stupid
rounded shoulders.
At this Mrs. Rollings stops. As well
she might. “You dare!” she screams.
“You! You!”
Miss Perrott rfetreats from that beast’s
face snarling in the dusk. From’ that
cudgel suddenly brandished. As, holding
up a protesting hand, she turns sideways,
down thuds Mrs. Rollings’s stick with
full force on the back of her neck.
Miss Perrott falls to the ground. For
a murderess Mrs. Rollings does some-
thing surprising. She bursts into
peals of laughter. “Oh, Gawd,” she
cries, “I hit her. Oh, Gawd, I hit her. I
broke my stick on her, broke it.” She
is helpless with racking mirth.
Miss Perrott sits up. “I beg your par-
don,” she says stiffly, “but those were
only the caterpillars of the sawfly. They
make that tapping sound to scare away
the birds,”
“The caterpillars of the sawfly! ” Mrs.
Rollings howls with laughter. She sits
down in the mud with Miss Perrott and
puts her arm around her. “I’m sorry I
hit you,” she says. “But you started it,
you know.”
“That stick would have been perfectly
useless if you’d had to kill a snake,” says
Miss Perrott, rubbing the back of her neck.
“Isn’t that just like me?” says Mrs.
Rollings, charmed.
“Look!” says Miss Perrott. The dark-
ness that has fallen on the mountain has
done them a kindly service. Far down,
far down, winks through the murk the
little light of the boarding-house. Miss
Perrott rises. “It’s exactly where I
said it was. And the track to the crossing
runs along the ridge this way.” Her
willow wand is lost in the dusk; she
points a trembling finger. >f
“We won’t bother about the track,
says Mrs. Rollings, sitting happily in the
mud, clutching her broken truncheon,
with the garland of clematis in her hair.
“We’ll go straight down here for the light
I don’t care how steep it is. We’ll
manage.”
“But it’s fearfully steep,” says Miss
Perrott. “And what about your hus-
band? He’ll probably be waiting for us
at the crossing. My word, how worried
he will be!”
Through the rainy dusk the face ot
Ted Rollings looms large and white in
Mrs. Rollings’s imagination as she rises
clumsily to her feet. It is sour with the
look of a man who has been kept wait-
ing ; fiercely the long jaw snaps; rain-
drops, steaming, are tossed with fury
from the end of that long, up-tilted nose:
such a “look” he gives her! Mr.
Rollings waiting ; Mr. Rollings search-
ing in the dusk; Mr. Rollings wet
through; Mr, Rollings baring his dog-
teeth —
“Oh, pooh!” says Mrs. Rollings.

Immortal Trousers.
“A Lincolnshire hedger and (hatcher wears
trousers that are 107 years old.”
—“Daily Telegraph."
It was during the clothing shortage that
my cousin Shem had a pair of imperish-
able trousers constructed.
Combining the resources of a tinsmith,
a master boilermaker, an oxy-acetylene
welder and the old spinning-wheel in the
parlor, the pants were built of steel wool.
copper wire, horsehair and vulcanised
plasticine. Cousin Shem estimated that
with normal wear and tear they would
last until his 137th birthday.
He found them particularly handy for
sport. He used to score several boun-
daries off both legs in every innings, while
an unwary opponent who tackled him
low in the football field had to be re-
tired to the reserves for the rest of the
season.
The trousers, however, caused a lot of
trouble in the home. When he took them
off at night the noise ranged from an
earthquake in an ironmonger’s store to
the sound of the Queen Mary’s anchor-
chain rattling through the hawseholes.
The steam-hammer which Shem used for
pressing them was continually getting in
the way in the kitchen. The garment also
had an unusually abrasive effect on the
seats of chairs, and on the frequent occa-
“H’m, roaring and interfering. We'll have to see about this."
sions when Shem toppled over it took
three of us with a block and tackle to re-
erect him.
These annoyances led to frequent
attempts to sabotage the life-span of
Shem’s trousers. But washing them in
nitric acid only gave them a brighter
patina, and the silverfish with which we
infested them died miserably. It was a
glorious day, therefore, when Shem came
home complaining of white-ants in his
pants.
They subsequently made a handy col-
ander for straining home-brew.

Unloaded Opinions.
“Backing up a de-mechanisation, back-to-
the-horse campaign being waged in Washington
by a retired American general of cavalry, a
Russian inspector-general of cavalry said:
‘How wrong were those who looked down dis-
dainfully on cavalry units from the height of
tank turrets!’ ”
Interviewed by Gass Agency, General
Plonkovitch, who, when the Soviet leaped
into the war to save the decadent Western

SSy a crushing defeat to the Nazis
by allowing Von Bock’s advance across
Russia through his stubborn contesting of
every inch of the way, to proceed at only
miof»rciKif« 7 n a Hav said that he
thoroughly agreed in principle with the
outlook of the American general, though
the American general hadn’t gone far
enoueh
The United States, General Plonko-
vitch proceeded, would be better advised
to scrap not only mechanised but horse-
drawn armies and depend on the more
reliable bullocks for traction power. Had
America shipped the bullocks and bisons
asked for for transport and attack pur-
poses, instead of all the useless ’planes,
trucks, tanks and self-propelled guns
which had obviously only been got rid
of to suck the blood of profit from an
ally, the Red Army would have massacred
Hitler’s hordes long before it did. That
the Americans didn’t do this naturally
rouses the suspicion that they had some
working arrangement with the Fascists.
In an article in the Party organ
“Dyzpepzia,” Marshal Bullshov strongly
urged the American Government, purely
in the interests of bird life, to abandon
the atomic bomb. “The Soviet,” wrote the
marshal, “which was the first to discover
the atom bomb as well as the steam engine
and radio, the secrets of which were
thieved by the U.S.A. and Britain, long
ago discarded it as useless. In any case,
quite apart from our deep concern for
our avian friends, the U.S.A. would be
stupid to persevere with a weapon which
has not only proved less effective than
massed rifle fire in war, but is far more
dangerous to those using it than to those
against whom it is used.
“With no motive other than the sincere
desire to see a well-armed America,”
went on the marshal,, “1 also strongly
recommend General Eisenhower to scrap
all such over-boomed weapons as rockets,
field guns, bazookas and machine-guns
and equip his armies exclusively with
arbalests. Thus armed, the-U.S. forces,
now grievously burdened with cumber-
some mechanised artillery, would immedi-
ately enjoy that same light mobility which
has made the brave Chinese Communist
armies some of the most formidable the
world has ever seen. The time is ripe for
the G.I. Joes to agitate for the crossbow
in place of the cannon.”
Giving high praise to the American
cavalry general for his campaign,
Defeatov, Moscow Radio’s well-known
commentator, strongly urged all Ameri-
can unionists immediately to start a series
of hunger and sit-down strikes until this
famous soldier, whose name he had for
the moment forgotten, was made Chief of
the General Staff in place of General
Eisenhower, who in a truly democratic
country like Russia would have been shot
without trial for the manner in which
he had bungled the European invasion
campaign, as proved by Comrade Inger-
soli in Top Secret.
“Our beloved Fiihrer in the Kremlin,”
declared Defeatov, “would undoubtedly
be willing, were this distinguished cavalry-
man with his advanced ideas to become
head of the U.S. army, to dispatch a
military mission to advise him on the
adoption of such tactical devices as the
solid phalanx, which was used so success-
fully by the Romans at Cannas, and the
best use to which massed arquebuses
could be put. Moreover, once the Soviet
was assured that the U.S.A. army was
equipped only with the arbalest and the
arquebus, and with transport limited to
iron-wheeled, bullock-drawn vehicles, our
Fiihrer would give his solemn unbreak-
able promise to scrap all the Soviet’s
mechanised might. It must be under-
stood, however,” concluded Defeatov,
“that the U.S.S.R. would not be open to
the snooping of any spies disguised as
American military missions to see if the
Soviet has disarmed. The inviolable word
Of our Fiihrer must be taken for it.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4£d. per line; all others 21d. per line.
Should They Have Votes?
Because “Ditto” (B. 26 /6 / ’46) had his
dignity ruffled by a crowd of hoodlums
he condemns a whole generation of 18-
year-olds and denies their right to vote.
There are hoodlums of all ages, and the
older they are the more vicious they seem.
During the war the Australian Gov-
ernment and people considered thousands
of 18-year-olds, myself among them, dis-
creet enough to be soldiers, sailors and
airmen. They even conscripted these poor,
“mentally immature” kids. The R.A.A.F.,
in its ignorance, entrusted millions of
pounds’ worth of equipment and positions
of danger and responsibility to youths
apparently incapable of choosing their
own Government. I know that youths
who served overseas before their 21st
birthdays are entitled to a vote, but
whether one went overseas or not the
possibilities and responsibilities of service
entitle one to some voice in the way this
country is governed. Now, although we
are no longer at war, the liability for
service remains for ’teen-age youth.
Another aspect of the case is that many
youths of 18 are today paying income-tax.
George Washington must be rotating in
his coffin at the thought of such “taxa-
tion without representation.”
Finally, and on a purely personal note,
if “Ditto” thinks that we lads who went
overseas at 18 in any way resembled
larrikins, he is welcome to a choice of
weapons. —J. B. C. (N.S.W.).
Parliamentary Broadcasts
During the House of Representatives
debate on the Parliamentary Broadcasting
Bill the fear was expressed that, if debates
were not broadcast in full, the public
would be denied the opportunity to hear
both sides.
In what dream-world do these word-
spinners dwell? The “public” works for
a living. The housewife, who has access
to the radio all day, has a set programme
of serials and musical “sessions” that fit in
nicely with her household work. She
isn’t likely to ditch her favorite pro-
grammes and neglect her housework to
concentrate on a debate that might last
for hours.
The breadwinners *of the community
have limited access to the radio. As a
rule evenings only may be devoted
to listening, and the programme has to
be acceptable to the whole family. Only
a Barrett of Wimpole-street would be
willing or able to impose upon his wife
and children a Parliamentary debate for
an entire evening, however brilliant the
oratory or important the subject.
In 46 years “Hansard” has achieved a
circulation of about 7000, most copies
going to Schools of Arts and newspaper
offices. This does not prove any great
desire on the part of electors to acquaint
themselves with the substance of Parlia-
mentary debates —and a debate that
occupies hours may be read in a few
minutes.
As an example of how proceedings may
drag on, the debate on the Australia-First
cases was resumed at 9.5 p.m. on
March 13, 1946, and adjourned at
10.7 that night; resumed at 5.27 next
evening, adjourned at 10.52 p.m.;
resumed- 11.20 a.m. March 15, and con-
cluded at 12.37 p.m. Total time, roughly
eight hours. Space in “Hansard” about
50 pages —say an hour’s reading. This
was a debate of great human interest, yet
I doubt if many electors would have been
able or willing to stay the course.
It seems certain that most listeners will
be spasmodic or accidental, and the
average elector will have only a fragmen-
tary knowledge of the happenings in the
national Parliament. The chief results
will be an increased waste of public
money, and an even more unsatisfactory
and expensive radio service.—C. G. Salis
(N.S.W.).
Machinery Pools
Australian farmers are notorious for
their neglect of machinery. I have
seen harvesters left in the paddock from
one season to another and ploughs which
had hardly ever seen a shed. If one
visits a farm anywhere in this country
and sees machinery in a shed and well
cared for, it’s a sure bet that the owner
is a successful man.
Australians could learn a lesson from
the British farmer and the machinery
pools in operation there. There are
depots every 25 miles throughout the
country where all machinery too expen-
sive for the average farmer to own is
housed, with a foreman in charge and
drivers to handle it. Farmers requisition
what machinery they require on the
county sub-committee, which caters for
10,000 acres. The scheme worked effi-
ciently right through the wars and looks
like being a fixture.
Many Australian farmers have a weak-
ness for over-buying of machinery with
consequent heavy capital outlay and
crippling load of interest. I can vouch
for the success of the British scheme —I
saw it in operation in 1944. — Wilydah
(N.S.W.).
Australian-made and Imported
After trying to buy an axe for six
months, my neighbor was actually offered
his choice of two. One bore an overseas
brand, world-famous, weighed 411 b. and
was 17s. 6d. The other was of Australian
make, weighed 41b., and was 19s. 6d.
My neighbor is a patriot—he has
fought for his country and prefers to
buy goods made by his countrymen. But
which axe did he buy? You’re right—
the imported article.
The axe is only one of hundreds of
lines similarly handicapped against world
competition, and the result is and will be
increasing preference to foreigners.—Sam-
son (S.A.).
Omens
I have been stood down because of
shortages. This morning I answered a
knock, at the front door and spoke
through the wire to a neatly-dressed, shy-
looking chap who tried to sell me a cake
of camphor. After lunch another caller,
equally bashful, tried to sell me a writing
pad.
Two swallows don’t make a summer,
and two door-knockers don’t make a de-
pression, but my two visitors scared me
more than all the headlines of the press.
Are these two salesmen the harbingers
of a long procession of hawkers such as
wore out my doormat in the lean years
before the war? Must I again get ready
to join the leaderless legion, swallowing
my pride a hundred times a day and
clearing my throat to say my little piece
through the wire-doors of strangers?
Surely it can’t happen twice in one life-
time. — Stop It (S.A.).
Cultural Backwaters
If “Wongajong” (B. 3/ 7 / ’46) really
wants those cultural amenities which he
bewails as missing in his present environ-
ment he ought to live in Sydney itself,
not in any of the numerous outlying
villages which usurp collectively a name
so worthily honored in Australian art and
literature. After all, why should their
simple denizens be interested in such un-
practical matters as Australian paintings
or highbrow literature for which they care
nothing and which they cannot under-
stand? They have their shops and busi-
nesses, their offices and jobs to attend to
in working hours, and when they get back
home to the village in the evening they
are content to call it a day, so far as
anything calling for mental effort beyond
a game of bridge is concerned.
“Wongajong,” too, overlooks the fact
that his fellow-villagers mostly have
radios, and that these can satisfy all their
requirements in the allegedly intellectual
line as they understand them. If the
yawps, discords, tinkles, quiz-sessions,
Australian hill-billy compositions, canned
elementary science, racing tips, foot-
ball news and the rest supplied so
generously by our own A.B.C. prove in-
adequate to fill the empty hours between
dinner and bed, there must surely be a
flick-joint within easy Teach. There they
can enjoy the latest Hollywoodenisms in
all their native nasality, complete with
wisecracks, cuties and one-man armies
still winnin’ de wah.
The illusion of being up to date and in
touch with the world from such inade-
quate foundations is not confined to
thousand-dwelling Sydneyside villages.
Australia at large is stagnating today in
a cultural backwater of an even worse
and muddier kind. Our best intellects
have to go abroad to find their true en-
vironment, and to stay there if they wish
to retain it. The intellectual level of our
seven “Governments,” which claim to be
the handpicked majority selection of the
Australian voter, can be judged by the
chaos of Communist-organised strikes
that immobilise industry, paralysing com-
merce and creating unemployment on a
scale previously unknown. Mr. Chifley’s
buck-passing must make the pious
founders of Federation revolve with in-
dignation in their honored graves.
But if “Wongajong” cannot really be
satisfied without Australian art, chess-
clubs and the rest he should waste no
time in removing himself over those in-
tervening eight miles and getting a nice
city flat with all mod. cons., including
such gas and electricity as the strike-
organisers may from time to time allow.
I am told that one can occasionally be
obtained from a wealthy returning
“refugee,” but he will need to be rich
to afford the key-money.—M. Turlutu
(Q-).
Canberra’s University
I see that the “Labor” Government,
in its zeal for culture, is going to establish
a university at Canberra which will cost
the nation round about a million. I hope
that the return will justify the expendi-
ture, but will it?
A university professor remembers.
What he remembers is quit? exalted, inas-
much as it is something some wise man
has said. But it is always the great man
of the past he reveres; the new great
man he doesn’t recognise, reviewing him
“So we just came as we Were!”
(or himself) in terms of his predecessors,
not in terms of his own experience. When
Freud’s ideas were new and fresh he
wasn’t allowed to lecture. Now he is dead
the universities have embalmed him.
Universities are second-hand dealers.
The great man from the university stand-
point is the best rememberer, not the
creative individual, and he wins all the
prizes, scholarships and exhibitions.
When universities do happen to get a
really great man they kick him out, as
Oxford did Shelley ; and if a Socrates
came amongst them they would kick him
out. .
Communism is fashionable in univer-
sity circles nowadays. It wasn t in Marx s
day ; so they have embalmed Marx.
As the universities help to preserve the
past they have some value, but Australia
already has half.a dozen of them quite
competent to do that job. Another
similar institution seems as superfluous
as Mr. Calwell’s Department of Informa-
tion.—W. Lackspear (Vic.).
Petrol Unlimited
While moving cattle along a road near
Northam (W.A.) I was passed by several
hundred cars bound for the local races.
Most came from Perth (60 miles), a few
from Bunbury (180 miles). One car had
a gas-producer, but it wasn’t alight.
The Government, which spends so
much to advertise economy, also controls
the use of petrol.
I suppose I might add that I count it
a privilege to pay taxes in a country
which, after surviving the most disastrous
war in history, and now is facing a period
of grave uncertainty at home, can still
send its city folk to a little country
race meeting on a working day.— Robert
Howie (W.A.).
A Matter of Age
Perhaps I am approaching senility, but
there are many things beyond my com-
prehension. If a man were 100 years
old or more, he could be a member or
Parliament, help to make laws and draw
a good salary. But a man of 70 is too
old to be a trustee for a recreation
ground or a cemetery.
When a man reaches 65 he is supposed
to be too old to work, though he may be
physically fit and more competent than
he was 20 years previously. He has to
retire, and, if he hasn’t made a fortune,
draw the old-age pension and be a burden
on the taxpayer. —J. P. C. (N.S.W.).
The Law
What strange ideas of justice our
administrators have! If hundreds com-
bine to break the law, the Prime Minister
says it’s useless to prosecute them the
greater the number the safer it is!
Our N. S. Wales laws provide for 6
p.m. closing, but the powers that be say
6.20 p.m. or so will be all right with
them. Our factories and shops legisla-
tion says that certain shops shall be open
only during specified hours, but benevo-
lent authorities ignore many breaches.
Our industrial laws are broken every day
and a timid Government condones or at
least ignores the offences.
Even in cases which reach the courts,
fines are remitted or reduced by a kind
dispensation which politicians call the
Royal Prerogative. Surely the magistrate
or Judge is in the best position to “make
the punishment fit the crime,” and cer-
tainly the Court can assess the evidence
better than any politician.
It isn’t that our laws cannot be im-
proved. But while the law is on the
Statute Book it is the duty of our admini-
strators to see that it is enforced without
fear or favor. If politicians can say
when and in what circumstances the
law shall operate, is it any wonder that
many others feel entitled to decide this
question for themselves? —Lex (N.S.W.).
Holidays for All
Interviewed over the air while I was
listening-in a breadcarter’s wife insisted
that “Bakers should have Saturday off
like everyone else.” It would be rather
interesting if this line of argument were
followed up and Saturday holidays made
compulsory for “everybody.”
. Rising on Saturday morning, the house-
wife would find no milk on her doorstep,
and no gas to heat the milk for breakfast
anyway—gas employees definitely come
under the category of “everybody.” There
would be no morning paper and no pubs
open for her spouse. Jockeys, of course,
would not ride on Saturdays and there
would be no transport of any kind, even
if there were something to see.
It sounds fantastic, but I’m merely
using the reasoning of those who insist
that nobody should work on a Saturday.
—J. H. M'. (N.S.W.).
Gifts Waiting
For many months The Bulletin has
been rude indeed about Mr. Forde,
Minister for the Army. It must surely
admit that, in a manner of speaking, he
hung his coat on the Siegfried Line.
True there were no Germans about at
the time. . „, . , T
As an appreciation of his valor 1 am

and should like you to ask your own
“Bo” to make the presentation.
Mr. Makin, our Navy Minister, will
soon be leaving for Washington and is
therefore in need of a suitable introduc-
tion to the Yanks. May I suggest that
Scorfield portray him with many circular
gold braid stripes on his trousers in addi-
tion to those on the sleeves?
Another 100,000 marks, a Reichsbank-
note of the 1923 vintage, is enclosed tor
Mr. Calwell for his great fairness to the
press. Perhaps “Mat’s Mate’ would

Tactical Training
In 1943, when the L.H.Q. Tactica*
School opened a company commanders
wing, the average standard of students
was incredibly low. Some officers coul
not use a service protractor or read a
ma p_ par t of the training of an efficient
private. Infantry officers knew little or
nothing about the supporting arms, whose
officers in turn were equally ignorant
about the infantry. The majority of
officers had had no prior training either
in planning in logical manner or in issuing
their orders clearly and concisely. Spine
officers had not heard of the principles
of war, and few had read Field Service
Regulations, Volume 11, which is the most
authoritative textbook on tactics.
During the next three years the course
—an intensive one lasting six weeks
was attended by over 1000 officers. Long
before the war ended the standard of
tactical knowledge throughout the A.M.F.
had improved beyond all expectation.
The lesson is that money and effort ex-
pended on high-class training establish-
ments are never wasted. Whatever else
in the peace-time Army may have to
practise economy, tactical, staff and
weapon-training schools must be main-
tained at the highest level. We dare not
allow four years of war again to pass be-
fore officers and n.c.os. are correctly
trained for their job.
Scarcely less important is the lesson
that tactical training within units relies on
help and stimulus from above. One of
the problems set at the tactical school
was the preparation of a simple indoor
exercise—so much of an art that the
best students found difficulty in producing
a passable effort. The army might there-
fore publish in pamphlet form some of
the cloth-model and sand-table exercises
used at the school. These exercises, com-
plete with suggested solutions and the
lessons to be stressed, would be a boon
to C.Os. and would ensure uniformity
of instruction.
The army might also establish at every
divisional headquarters a library of
books of general military interest and
history—important subjects which, during
the war, the young officer had no chance
of studying.
Finally, there should be a semi-official
journal in which officers can express their
ideas on tactical, logistical and administra-
tive matters. Tactics should be the sum
total of knowledge and experience gained
from all battles—not, as a British officer
once cynically remarked, “the expression
of opinion of the senior officer present.’
—Peter Mike (W.A.).
“So Were the Dutch”
“It is my conviction that if we main-
tain the friendships forged in war we
shall never again see our liberties im-
perilled.” Thus Mr. Chifley in his mes-
sage to the President of the Philippines
on the proclamation of their indepen-
dence. He added that “as, free people
Australia and the Philippines willingly
co-operated in a joint effort to achieve a
better world.”
But, as Mr. Chifley’s Government has
dearly demonstrated, liberties can be im-
perilled from within as well as from with-
out, and his description of Australians
as a free people is serio-comic. It is cer-
tainly untrue while industrial chaos dis-
orders our daily lives, while the hunt for
a place to live is desperate or while the
rewards of individual effort are so largely
taken in taxation.
Mr. Roxas in his reply to the Prime
Minister said that his people were im-
pressed with the large number of Aus-
tralian products which could help fill their
needs. So were the Dutch. —N. H. H.

Blackforce
In “What About Java?” (B. 29/5/’46)
a quotation from Rohan Rivett’s Behind
Bamboo states that three battalions of
seasoned A.I.F. trooops from the Middle
East were landed in Java.
Actually there were only two —the
2/2nd Pioneers and 2/3rd Machine
Gunners, the latter arriving without their
machine guns, which had travelled on
another ship. The Third Battalion of
Brigadier Blackburn’s brigade, officially
dubbed “X Battalion,” was composed of
some 2/4th M.G. Battalion reinforce-
ments, who never got further than
Batavia on their way to Malaya and
A.I.F. bits and pieces which had got away
from Singapore, plus the spare parts of
the 3rd M.T. Company, which had been
shipped from Singapore a few days be-
fore capitulation. There was a reference
to the Singapore reinstoushments in the
citation accompanying Brigadier Black-
burn’s 1946 British decoration.
Incidentally, the two Middle East bat-
talions were under the illusion that the
A.I.F. in Malaya had not done well.
They received an issue of pamphlets
and lectures on how to fight the Jap
during their voyage from the Middle
East.— Deloraine (Q ).
State Boundaries
The following advertisement from the
Yarrawonga “Chronicle” (2/7/’46) is a
classic example of the idiocy of State
boundaries:
APPLICATIpNS ARE INVITED
from females qualified for the positron of
Junior Clerk with the Coreen Shire
Council. Applicants must have passed
the New South Wales Intermediate Cer-
tificate Examination.
Note that it’s an advertisement in a Vic-
torian paper for a position for which no
Victorian-educated girls need apply.—
W. G. (Vic.).
The Professions
“Professor’s” yardstick of the profes-
sions (B. 3/ 7 / ’46) is hard cash—he wants
everything reduced to terms of £ s. d.
His ignorance of what constitutes a pro-
fession is astounding—architecture, the
oldest profession but one, is dismissed
under • “suchlike subjects” as law and
dentistry.
The professions offer the only chance of
independent thought and action. One is
taught to think coherently and logically,
fact takes preference over fiction, and
education of the mind is the supreme
aim.
The guiding of thought to creative
effort cannot be compared in terms of
working hours, measured by hard cash,
or judged by uneducated opinion. Com-
pared with the bookie and pubkeeper, the
professional man is not in the financial
race, but the intellectual satisfaction of
achievement is a better reward for a
better way of living.—Friba (Q.).
Publicity
The desire for publicity seems to be as
strong a factor in human affairs today as
the love of money. Most Australians
affect to despise the more blatant forms
of U.S. self-advertising (such as the title-
page of an American magazine with the
names of the staff from managing pditor
to junior sub., and the list of names which
precedes a film, where even the lady re-
sponsible for the hair-dos receives her
meed of publicity) without realising how
the same tendencies are creeping into
our own national life.
A.B.C. “features” are typical. After
the names of the players come the
announcements, “Written and presented
by ,” “Under the direction of
“Musical score arranged by ,” “Your
compere was —.” Ten years ago,
who knew or cared a dump about the
identity of the person who read the news?
Now, the name of “Our special com-
mentator” or “Our roving reporter” is
an integral part of every broadcast. The
last generation of journalists presented
their news and views to the world in per-
sonal obscurity; today, the legion of
“columnists” and “ace reporters” con-
siders an unsigned article infra dig.
To those with an inordinate love of
seeing their names in print, notoriety is
preferable to obscurity. If newspapers
called union bosses by their official titles
only, and tabooed names, photos and
propaganda, there would be a sharp de-
cline in the number of strikes and indus-
trial troubles. Years ago a politician
showed me his scrapbook. Every news-
paper attack upon him had been lovingly
cut out and pasted into the book. It was
all “good publicity.” —W. K. D. (Q.).
Party First
Professor John Harley-Mason, one of
the British scientists sent to study German
scientific methods after the war ended,
made this comment after his return;
I had assumed that in Germany most
scientists would have been actively en-
gaged in war activities, but found that a
great many prominent scientists there had
continued through the war bn academic
problems, and had made little contri-
bution to the war effort. Many first-
class scientific minds were left' out of the
picture, and the positions which would
most properly be theirs were occupied
by second-rafe men who were high in the
favor of the Nazi party. For this reason,
despite remarkable achievements in some
directions, the German scientific effort
was lopsided and much time was spent
on projects which can only be described
as fantastic.
But for the policy of “preference to party
supporters,” the Nazis might well have
been first in the field with the atomic
bomb. There is a lesson in it for this
country where political color has carried
too much weight in many recent import-
ant appointments. —Junius Jr. (Q.).
More Gold ?
Certainly we should produce more
gold, but J. G. Peterson’s plan (B.
10/7/’46) wouldn’t work out as he thinks.
He wants the Government to pay £l5 an
ounce for newly-mined gold, which, if
sold overseas, would enable the import
of about £lO worth of goods. The Gov-
ernment — i.e., the nation —would thus
lose £5 on every ounce.
. If this is not a subsidy, J.G.P. should
write a new dictionary. In it, he should
also give his new definition of the word
“reserve,” as a device for eating your
cake and having it. For, if we use gold
to buy dollars, it will be gone. How, then,
can it still serve as “backing” for the vast
increase in the note issue which he pro-
poses?
If, however, we simply keep the gold,
the issuing of paper money to pay for it
(“without borrowing or taxing”) will be
straightout inflation. We already have
too much money and too few goods to
buy with it. Hence price-control, ration-
ing and felackmarkets. More paper
money, whether backed by gold or any-
thing else, will simply increase our diffi-
culties.
Gold is our best export commodity as
it has a guaranteed price, but to produce
it at a loss would be no help at all.
—Arc (N.S.W.).
Time, Please!
Had Mr. Falstein been a member of
the Sydney Stock Exchange, the fact of
his securing a licence to import Swiss
watches valued at £2700 and thereby be-
coming a peddler of timepieces would
have meant a heavy fine and expulsion
for unprofessional conduct.
Evidently the professional standing of
barristers is not so high as that of
members of the Stock Exchange. —
Vonvotch (N.S.W.).
Military Law
I agree that military law is “inherently
fair” (B. 3/7/’46), but as an orderly-room
sergeant during the war I found very few
officers capable of conducting an orderly-
room. Here are some illustrations.
An acting sergeant was charged on
four counts of forging leave passes, two
of forging pay chits, and one of a.w.l.
The C.O. awarded a reprimand on each
of the forgery counts and remanded the
n.c.o. for court-martial on the a.w.l.
charge. Correct procedure is to remand
the soldier on all counts so that they may
be heard together and one award made.
A soldier was charged with “conduct
to the prejudice of good order and mili-
tary discipline” twice in the same day and
fined £5 each time. This was illegal, and
later the soldier was agreeably surprised
to receive a credit of £5 in his pay book.
The error had been detected and pointed
out by District Records Office.
One C.O. had a habit of fining lance-
corporals and awarding them C.B. All
fines were later refunded by the District
Finance Office and the C.O. advised that
n.c.os. could not be fined nor awarded
C.B.
An n.c.o. was charged with being two
days a.w.l. The C.O. dismissed the case.
Then he realised that he should have made
an award of some sort because, as the man
was actually a.w.1., automatic forfeiture
of pay was involved and this fact would
have to be noted on the charge report.
But he had torn up the charge report.
Undaunted, he had another tvned and.
“ I still don't think you've quite caught his right expression."
without notifying the n.c.o. concerned,
entered the automatic forfeiture of pay
and allowance for two days plus an
award of “reprimand.” First the n.c.o.
knew of it was when the Pay Office called
for his paybook to make 'the necessary
entries.
A company commander, hearing an
a.w.l. charge, fined the soldier 55.,
awarded him three days’ C.B. and docked
him pay and allowances for the period of
absence. The soldier, on 6s. 6d. a day,
rightly protested when he found an entry
in the debit side of his paybook for
Bs. 6d.
In my experience very few officers
dealt properly with minor offences,
Some made up their minds about
a case before the accused was marched
into the orderly room. One C.O.
had fixed fines for a.w.l. offences at
the rate of £1 for each day absent up to
£5. “Conduct to the prejudice” was
always worth £2, while “being absent
from place of parade” carried 14 days
C.B. as penalty.
Minor offences should be heard by
independent officers who are thoroughly
trained in administration and military law.
Then justice, as military law intends it,
would be meted out. — Orderly Room
(S.A.).
Permanent Army
When does Army Minister Forde in-
tend to make a statement on rates of pay
and conditions of service in the Perma-
nent Military Forces? Many serving
members of * the A.I.F. are only too
anxious to transfer to the P.M.F., but are
holding back until something definite is
offered. They would like to be sure of
adequate pay and to know where they are
likely to be garrisoned and whether they
can take their families with them. And
they would like the option of re-enlisting
when their term of duty has finished.
Since Mr. Forde gave out the bald
statement that Australia is to have a large
standing army he has made no effort to
clear up any of these vital points.
A. McK. (Vic.).
The “Endau Coffee Pols”
The “Vildebeestes” of the Malayan
campaign (B. 10/7 / ’46) were modem
compared with the “Endau Coffee Pots.”
These were two old Moths or Avros be-
longing to the Johore Aero Club. The
volunteer pilots, armed with revolvers,
made a regular morning reconnaissance
along the east coast, earning the respect
of every man in the 22nd Brigade.
For a few days their luck held and
they met nothing. Then one morning
they ran into two Jap Army bombers.
“C” Co., of the 20th, saw the Japs waggle
their wings as a signal then close in on
the old crates. One burst from each
bomber sent the Avros earthwards. I
heard that both pilots survived, although
they were badly injured. — Frank Mauri
(N.S.W.),
Poultry for Malaya
Consignment of 400 tiay-old chicks
from Sydney to Singapore by air should
form the basis of a very profitable busi-
ness for Australian hatcheries. Just be-
fore the outbreak of war attempts to
hatch out eggs flown from Sydney met
with marked success.
Poultry raising in Malaya is not so
difficult as might be imagined. There is
ample shade and abundant insect life —
a sugarbag of dried insects costs less than
eighteenpence. The Malay doesn’t be-
lieve in such expenditure, however, and
beyond throwing them the household
scraps makes his fowls forage for them-
selves. The local product is not much
bigger than a pullet when full-grown and
makes a comfortable meal for one, but
at lOd. to two-bob each they’re not an
extravagant meal. Eggs are proportion-
ately small and are sold in tens at
approximately a penny each,
Fowls have practically vanished from
Malaya, and the larger Australian birds
will fetch big prices as soon as they reach
maturity. Hazards they will have to
overcome include pythons, hawks and
chook-hungry natives. — Mart (N.S.W.).
