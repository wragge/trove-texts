Are We Musical?
About once a mouth (which is the aver-
age interval between our send-offs of half-
trained budding Melbas to conquer London)
one of our fellow-countrymen gets up and
tells us (amidst wild applause from the
rest of us) how wonderfully musical we
are. But are we? It is probably quite
true that we produce more than our quota
of good voices. But at that we stop. And,
after all, good voices are born, not made,
and we can no more justly pride ourselves
on the possession of them than we can
on our sunshine. It is also probably true
that we are more musical in some ways
than our English cousins, though even that
admits of very hot debate. But when we
come to compare ourselves with the Latin
races and the Germans we certainly find
ourselves hopelessly out of the front rank
of the musically-educated.
Last year Belgium was my home for a
while. It is there, in the little cafes of
Brussels and Antwerp, that you find the
level which their musical education has
reached. Every cafe, no matter how small,
lias its orchestra. And every orchestra would
make the piano-fiddle teams which endeavor
to persuade us to chew our food in rhythm
green with envy. Their repertoire is broad
and cosmopolitan. They give a little jazz,
much light opera and a fair sprinkling of
the heavier classics. But the astonishing
part is this: the people cease their noise
as soon as the orchestra, begins to play.
They listen attentively, and at the conclusion
of the performance often discuss the musical
menu with appreciation and intelligence. To
do that they must necessarily have a know-
ledge of their subject.
I shall always remember staying at the
Grand Hotel in Antwerp and, whilst lying
abed in the mornings, listening to the domes-
tics humming or singing happy tunes as they
went about their duties. The important
point was the nature of the tunes. For the
most part they were operatic airs. The
voices were far from equal to the task, but
the outstanding fact was that these people
knew the tunes and preferred singing them
to any others.
Consider our support of any opera com-
pany that doesn’t boast a galaxy of stars
to lure us. A week or two back there ap-
peared in the Sydney press piteous wails for
more support for a little company that was
struggling for life at the Sydney Hippo-
drome. Compare the experience of this
company with that of the opera companies
in Antwerp and Brussels. The latter place
is of course world-renowned. But the
former city has an opera house open between
four and six months of every year. The
whole* house is bookable, and it is extremely
difficult' to get a seat anywhere at less than
three or four days’ notice. And they play
seven days a week. The people go to hear
tin* music—not merely as a social duty.
Opera to the Britisher is a social event of
the first magnitude. In many cases he
knows little of the piece that he hears and
cares less. All he does know is that Mr.
and Mrs. Algernon Fitznoodle from next
door went and heard Melba in “Boheme,”
and that for the sake of his own and his
wife’s social standing, it’s up to him to do
the same. Sydney and Melbourne flock to
celebrity concerts. Probably because the
musical fare served up is discreetly flavored
to suit all palates, they enjoy the show* fairly
well. But what happens when one of their
fellow-countrymen or women returns? Ask
—well, perhaps it is kinder to refrain from
mentioning names.
To sum up, it is probably true that Divine
Providence has given Australians beautiful
organs on -which to make music. But their
general musical education is in the same
state as the North Shore Bridge, whose foun-
dations are about to be laid L _
KEITH BARRY.
The Alien Jew
Without bothering to analyse the reasons,
the inspired writer of the Scriptures who an-
nounced that the Jews were to be a “pecu-
liar people” gave a description that remains
true ; even the Jew who tries most to sub-
merge himself in the people around him, and
resents being regarded as peculiar, clings pas-
sionately to this characteristic. The Jew fre-
quently contrives to be a very good English-
man or a very good German, but still re-
mains a Jew; he is an internationalist-
was an internationalist before international-
ism became a cult —and yet is essentially
tribal. It is worth while recalling that Karl
Marx, despite his doctrines of international
justice, believed in local and racial patriot-
ism under the cover of a general friendliness ;
apart from the observance of certain wide
principles of universal relationships he be-
lieved in the development of each group of
people on their own cultural lines as likely
to give the best values—an ideal far removed
from the dragooning policy of the Soviet.
Like the study of woman, the study of the
Jew has been one of perennial interest; in
the first case the puzzle has been created by
people who plumbed solemnly for depths
where there are mostly shallows; in both
of them, woman and Jew alike have been
their own least able interpreter. Israel Zang-
wilf can describe the Jew and scores of Jew-
ish types with wit and fidelity, but he cannot
interpret himself. With a number of
other leading lights of literature, many of
whom declined the task, he was asked by a
London journal to describe his religion. His
description of himself as a man who had de-
parted from certain Judaic rules so as to
show how good a Jew he could be without
them, whilst he is known to cling passion-
ately to Jewish leadership, was confusing.
Had he not possessed the. general Jewish
characteristic of having plenty of wit but
very little humor, he would have been with
those who declined the task. There has been
a controversy in the Paris Temps recently
between G. B. Shaw and Henri Bernstein, in
which Shaw told the French dramatist that,
being a Jew, he is Oriental to the backbone
and knows nothing of Frenchmen, English-
men and Irishmen. In spite of his generous
addition that, compared with Israel, the
Western races were parvenus, almost savages,
and that, with his hatred of idolatry, the
Jew is essentially an idealist who adores
ideals to the point of idolatry, G.B.S. re-
ceived the reply from the angered Bernstein
that he was an anti-Semite—a typically Jew-
ish retort under criticism.
E. T. Raymond has added to Beacons-
fieldian bibliography Disraeli, the Alien
Patriot (Hodder and Stoughton, London),
a book which ranks with Belloc’s “The Jew”
(although that was unfriendly) and scores
of others in the discussion of the peculiar
race. Recently Claude Montefiore, who, with
sundry other prominent British Jews,
in their pride of being Britons, formed the
Union of British Jews with the special idea
of giving it emphasis, formulated a phrase
to explain himself and his friends —“English-
men of the Jewish Faith.” There is a
similar movement amongst Jews in other
countries—in Germany an association of
German Jewish citizens is particularly
proud of his services to the Fatherland. In
China, indeed, although the matrimonial
exclusiveness of the Jewish communities
appears to have been maintained strictly,
environment has stamped a certain celestial
cast on the features of the old community
of Jews; yet they remain Jews.
E. T. Raymond’s book shows that Disraeli,,
though he had ceased to be of the Jewish
faith, remained a Jew. The' title, “The
Alien Patriot,” was chosen very deliberately:
whilst Disraeli was certainly a patriot
whose service to Britain was of incalculable
value, he was still an alien. His father,
Isaac Disraeli, tried desperately to assimilate
himself to England and the English, had
his son baptised in the Established Church,
and purposely employed the poet Rogers—
showing the literary patronage which is a
strong Jewish characteristic—to estrange
the boy from the people of his origin; yet,
no doubt describing his own attitude towards
his schoolmates, Disraeli in his novels
pictures in Vivian Grey and Contarini Flem-
ing an outlook which is not that of the
English schoolboy. He desperately associ-
ated himself with the most conservative
English affiliations, including the Established
Church and Tory politics, and even went to
cattle shows “with his corkscrew ringlets
and pallid face. . .punched fat cattle, and did
other things only meet and proper to cropped
heads and beefy jaws.” He was as alien in
Parliament as lie was in such surroundings.
“Whenever he tried to speak as a great
Englishman speaks under the stress of deep
emotion,” Raymond says, “or on the inspira-
tion of a great idea, he failed miserably.”
Bismarck, disdaining all these English as-
sumptions, frankly expressed his fear of “the
little Jew Disraeli”; had he been an
Englishman Bismarck would not have feared
him—it was the unassessed quality in him
the German dreaded.
So Disraeli remained Disraeli the Jew
despite all his efforts to be an Englishman.
As a matter of fact, he provided a contradic-
tion to his own efforts in the pride he main-
tained in his Jewish ancestry. And the
Jews claim him proudly in spite of his
apostasy; many of them, satisfied with re-
maining “peculiar people” whilst striving to
be good citizens and patriots, are inclined to
resent far more the Montefiore attitude.
“Alien” might indeed be too harsh a word —
a word too liable to misunderstanding—were
it not for the lack of an intermediate term
to describe the race-separateness of the Jew,
apparent even in Australia, where he occu-
pies many honored positions. Perhaps that
element of alien characteristic was the factor
invaluable to Britain and the British Empire
in some of the work Disraeli did for her,
notably in Suez Canal negotiations.
H. M.
Max Stirner and Nietzsche
Nothing in literature is more curious than
the way in which Max Stirner keeps crop-
ping up in newspapers and magazines, and
even in professorial monographs, as the only
begetter of Nietzsche. Just lately a re-
viewer of the late Dr. Maclaurin’s “Mere
Mortals” spoke of the filiation as an estab-
lished fact. Dr. A. Wolf, in his admirable
study of Nietzsche’s philosophy, suggests that
statements of this kind are made by men
who are ignorant of the history of philo-
sophy. An awful example cculd be cited
from America. But men like Brasch and
Hartmann and Tiirck, and, more recently.
Dr. Paul Oarus, must at least have glanced
through the “Republic” and the “Gorgias”
of Plato.
Max Stirner, whose real name was
Schmidt, has, through the career of his
second wife, Marie Dahnhardt, some per-
sonal interest for Australians. Ilis father
was a wind-instrument maker of Anspach,
who died of consumption at the age of 37,
some six months after the boy was born.
The widow did not remain long unconsoled.
At the end of another half-year she married
an apothecary’s assistant. What eventually
became of her is not known, but when last
heard of she was insane. Thus Max Stirner
was, so to speak, born in the pathological
purple—consumption on one side, insanity on
the other. Young Schmidt was given the
name Stirner by his schoolmates on account
of the remarkable height and slope of his
forehead ( stirn ). He was twice married,
first in 1837, when he was about 30, to his
landlady’s daughter. She died within a
year. Not long after her death Max got a
position as teacher in a girls’ school; and
it was about this time that he met Marie
Dahnhardt. Other members of his circle
were Friedrich Engles (the .friend of Karl
Marx) and Bruno Bauer and liis brothers
Egbert and Edgar. No two human beings
could be more unlike than Max and Marie.
He was meek, gentle, probably (like
Nietzsche) timid; she an emancipated cigar-
smoking lady, who s.ometimes wore the
breeches literally. They decided to marry,
on whose initiative one may guess.
It was during the first year after this mar-
riage that Max Stirner wrote his magnum
opus, which has been translated with the title
(not a good rendering) “The Ego and His
Own.” As it was probable that he would
lose his position in the school on the publica-

went sour, and the inevitable failure
f ° After three years of wedded bliss Mane
got sick of her anarch, and left him to the
contemplation of his unique self, bhe went
to London and set up as a teacher. Though
she started under the protection ot the t'rus-
sian ambassador’s wife, failure dogged her
steps. About the year 1853 she emi-
grated to Australia, and settled m Melbourne.
Here she earned her living honorably and
bravely as a washerwoman. On the death ot
her sister she came into some means and re-
turned to London, where the whilom cigar-
smoking anarchist died in the odor ot sanc-
tity when well over 80. Max Stirner had
died in 1856 from the bite of a poisonous
fly—a brother egoist.
Both Nietzsche and Stirner sprang philo-
sophically from the loins of the later Greek
Sophists. Their chief ideas —even then worn
threadbare —were threshed out in the first
book of Plato’s “Republic” by Socrates and
Thrasymachus, and in the “Gorgias” by
Socrates and Callicles. The whole life of
Socrates was a long effort to root these ideas
out of the minds and lives of his fellow-
citizens. For this life’s labor the Athenians
rewarded Socrates by handing him the
poison-cup. One wonders whether Dr. Carus
and the others who call Stirner the proto-
type of Nietzsche have ever considered a
passage like this:—
The temperate man is a fool ; only in hungering
and eating, in thirsting and drinking, in having
all his desires about him and gratifying every pos-
sible desire does man live happily.
Thus spake not Zarathustra, nor yet Max
Stirner, but Callicles in the “Gorgias” 2000
years before either was born. “There is
no right at all,” says Thrasymachus, “and
what we call by that name is only the in-
terest of the stronger.” Before Plato was
out of swaddling clothes, Protagoras, the
first of the Sophists, had in a single sen-
tence planted the seed which blossomed in
the later Sophists, and of which our two
Germans were the fine and ultimate flower.
“Man is the measure of all things; of things
that are, that they are; of things that are
not, that they are not,” he said, and the
doctrines that set all Europe agape towards
the end of the nineteenth century are no
more than an unpacking of this epigram.
The whole contents of the Stirner-Nietzsche
box of tricks were mere flotsam and jetsam
gathered from the vast ocean of Greek
philosophy.
But though Max Stirner and Nietzsche
both sprang from seed sown by the Greek
Sophists they were otherwise poles asunder
—in fact, mutually exclusive or destructive.
Stirner was an egoistic individualist: every
new human being born into the world is
absolutely unique; no law of God or man or
devil can bind him or in any way limit his
right to do exactly what he likes. For
Nietzsche this is sheer blasphemy against
the majesty of the Overman. “Individual
egoism,” he says, “is one of the most com-
mon frauds of the nineteenth century.” The
individual member of the swinish multitude
has no rights at all. The great masses of
men—not merely the proletariat, but the
employing and professional classes also—are
to be tolerated on the earth only that they
may serve as manure for the ground which
is to produce the Overman, and as hewers
of wood and drawers of, water for him when
he begins to arrive in quantity on the planet.
Already we have had some faint adumbra-
tion of what he will be like in Csesare Borgia,
Napoleon, possibly Goethe, and, as a sort
of John the Baptist, in Nietzsche himself.
What the ape is to us, that are we to this
Overman; and we have only one meaning
and one duty in life—to prepare the way
for his coming. To this Nietzschean gospel
of the Overman Max Stirner would most cer-
tainly have replied: “Don’t talk to me about
my duty to your iiew races or types of men.
I owe duty to nobody on this earth but my
unique individual self, and you and your
Overman may go to blithering blazes.”
HENRY MOLONY.
“Submerged Renown’’
Mark Twain tells, in liis Autobiography,
how he sat with R. L. Stevenson one after-
noon in Times-square, New York, and dis-
cussed “submerged renown.” They invented
the phrase between them to describe the
authors of best sellers who never rise to the
surface in the literary reviews. The sub-
merged tenth of the literary world sell their
books in car-loads while the famous high-
brows are selling an odd copy or two; but
the critics know them not. The authors
with the largest public are not Galsworthy,
Masefield, Shaw and the others who make
a noise in the world, but Effie Rowlands,
E. M. Hull, Zane Grey and their fellows.
The critics learnedly discuss the relative
merits of May Sinclair, Clemence Dane,
Sheila Kaye Smith, Walpole and Swinnerton.
Ethel Dell outsells the whole boiling of
them, but no critic ever discusses her.
The submerged tenth, for the most part,
are writers of sentimental “human” stories
which appeal to the big, soft heart of their
big, soft public, but which the critics con-
sider beneath their notice. Occasionally,
however, a writer of distinction is sub-
merged for political or social reasons.
Robert Blatchford, Socialist and unbeliever,
was selling his books in millions, but it
wasn’t until he turned patriotic and respect-
able that the critics “discovered” him.
Bernard Shaw was submerged for many
years, his renown being confined to Socialist
and Radical circles.
Beneath the authors of the • best sellers
are lower depths of submerged renown. Here
dwell the writers of shilling shockers and
dime novels, of soppy serials and penny
novelettes, of boys’ books and girls' books
and religious fiction. The great world above
never hears of them, but they enjoy a sub-
terranean celebrity.
There are compensations for the sub-
merged. The storms of the upper air never
strike them. The lordly liners of literature
are a mark for all the big guns of criticism,
while the literary submarines, safe in their
sunless fathoms, cannot be hit even by a
depth charge.
There are still lower depths: the abode
of the unpublished, the unpublishable. It
is the custom to pity these inheritors of un-
fulfilled renown, who “die with all their music
in them.” But they need no pity; theirs is
the better part. A published book may be
damned, a play may be hissed off the stage.
The unpublished author runs no such risks.
No thorns are twined with his laurels, no
canker worm blights his' bays. His is the
prize without the race.
Every little township has its poet who
enjoys a local celebrity on the strength of
a few album verses. So long as he does not
risk his reputation by publishing his verses,
his fame (such as it is) is more assured
than that of Gordon or Lawson. I know an
occasional local versifier who introduces him-
self to strangers thus simply: “I am The
Poet.” Not boastfully; merely stating the
fact. The strangers have certainly never
read his poems, but they take “The Poet’s”
renown for granted, and spread it further.
Another man I know has for many years
enjoyed a local reputation as a dramatist —
lie nearly got into Parliament on the strength
of it. His play has never been staged, never
been published; the only man who, to my
knowledge, ever had a glimpse at it described
it as a childish performance. No matter; he
has written a play. He is a celebrity.
Shakspeare himself could do and be no more.
P. R. THOMPSON.
The Ungrammatical Ear
“John o’ London,” in his little book, “Is
it Good English?” defends the use of a sin-
gular verb with a plural subject in certain
w T ell-known cases. For instance: —
“Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the
glory.” Here is is superior to are because it sug-
gests by anticipation the attribution of a single
thing—the all—not merely the things that are
about to be named, but whatever else breath cannot
name.... To say “Thine are the kingdom, and the
power, and the glory” is less comprehensive; it
savors of enumeration.
“And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these
three.” Here a singular verb suggests the rigorous-
ness of the final selection, and the individual greatness
of the three. It is as though we read “And now
abideth faith, abideth hope, abideth charity, these
three.” The superior magnetism and emphasis of
the singular verb is the real origin of this depart-
ure from grammar.... r
We come to the “Recessional.” Mr. Kipling’s
use of the singular verb is justified, not merely
by the fact that “tumult” and “shouting” combine
to form one idea, but also by the higher considera-
tion that the singular verb is more intense, and,
therefore, more suited to a dignified and penetrating-
theme than the plural verb. Dies is a greater word
than die.
This is all very ingenious; I submit that
it is, indeed, unnecessarily ingenious.
Mankind is by nature tidy: he longs to fit
things into their own little pigeon-holes, and
anything that defies classification, that
stands aloof, or is in any way a jarring ele-
ment, is abhorrent to him. For this reason
he has a code of manners and a fashion of
dress; for this reason also he seeks to de-
port those whose radical views make a dis-
cord in his harmony. Fart of his love of
poetry is based on this inherent tidiness;
the recurrence of stress, of rhyme, of con-
sonantal and vowel sounds tickle the ear and
train it to listen for and to expect these re-
petitions. And in this lies a more likely
reason for each of the above “errors.” In the
first, “is” is superior to “are” simply be-
cause it sounds better; and it sounds better
because its vowel sound fits in with the
vowel sounds in “thine” and “kingdom”;
“are” provides a jarring note in this respect.
Why does “art.” sound better than “is” in
“Our Father who art in Heaven”? Both are
singular verbs, and, therefore, according to
“John o’ London’s” dictum, should have
equal intensive value. An examination of
the sound sequence will give us the reason.
The similarity of sound in “father” and “art”
and in “who” and “Heaven” gives a balance,
a compactness, and a completeness to the
line that are lost (I nearly wrote “is lost”)
if “is” is substituted. In fact, it is balance,
whether of vowel and consonantal sound, of
rhythm or of sentence structure, that gives
the Lord’s Prayer its perfect form.
The unconscious love of the rhythmic is
responsible for the use of “abideth” in the
second example. Any ear, and in particular
a poetic one, would be misled by the first
two iambic feet into expecting a third ;. and
the subsequent full stresses on “faith,”
“hope,” “charity” only tend to emphasise
these as they should be emphasised.
Lastly, “John o’ London” is right in say
ing that “dies” is a greater word than “die.”
But it is so, not because it is singular in
form, but because of the prolonged sibilant
at the end, which echoes the sense. After
all. language is mainly aural and spontane-
ous ; the greater the writer the less reasoned
it becomes ; and often the ear, though erring
according to the strict rules of grammar,
will hit on a happier and truer effect than
could ever come from the clear reasoning
mind.
JOHN R. LYALL.
Burns
A Pagan in his passion for thp earth,
A Christian in his yearning toward Heaven,
With heart love-consecrated and lust-riven
He shakes the rafters with tumultuous mirth.
Or pleads with soulful sighs for ignored
worth;
But when he’s wroth his fiery shafts are
driven
Straight to their mark as deadly as the
levin
That crashes down an oak of giant girth.
No eagle spirit with an insect’s wings
Or sickly sage, he is of Titan breed,
And harsh disaster forged the mace he swings.
Until the love wounds ache and throb and
bleed.
Then from the abysmal deep the song up-
springs.
And at his lips behold the Maestro’s reed!
N.S.W.
ARTHUR ALBERT BAYIDON.
A Satchel of Books
Lowanna, by Castleden Dove (Oxford Press). This
purports to be an Australian school-story for girls,
but beyond the introduction of a few gum-trees, some
references to the Sydney Town Hall, the Zoo, Manly,
and a few other places of local interest, the tale
might as well have run its innocuous course in sorrie
English provincial town.
Nora Pays, by Lucille Van Slyke (Methuen). A
domestic story of conflicting temperaments wherein
husband and wife while “physically attracted to
each other are mentally distracted by each other.”
Not romance, not dependent on any sex-problem,
but a drama •of commonplace life with a note of
pity in it.
A Casual Commentary, by Rose Macaulay (Meth-
uen). The commentaries cover a wide area of life’s
activities and interests, from choosing a religion to
the selection of a wife. Each subject is dealt with
in a light vein, informed by common sense and
touched by the spirit of not unkindly sarcasm
characteristic of this popular novelist.
Myself Not Least, by “X” (Thornton Butter-
worth). His publishers refer to the author as “one
of the wittiest and vividest personalities of the time.”
Kings and Queens —some of them minor potentates
of the Balkan States—statesmen, authors, artists
and actors who have had or are having their little
day jostle each other in the pages as the writer
surveys his life. An outstanding book of bio-
graphical anecdote.
The Fur-Hunters, by Joseph Bowes (Oxford
Press). The fur is that of the ’possum, and the
hunters in Australian wilds are two Queensland
lads. The author is no prentice hand at this class
of boys’ fiction, and he puts in the local atmosphere
with the confidence of one who knows it; but his
dialogue is stilted. Incidentally, he conveys in
his story of adventure some useful information about
our flora and fauna.
On the Diamond Trail in British Guiana, by
Owen Richardson (Methuen). A local interest is
given to this story of adventure by the fact that
the writer’s old home was Ballarat (Vic.). “During
our summer holidays,” she says, “my mother, my
sister and I used to delight in washing for gold
in the sands of clear little bush creeks,” and
possibly this early quest for treasure gave a bias
to her later life, when she went on a prospecting
venture up the Mazaruni River in British Guiana in
search of diamonds. Of all the far-flung scraps of
the British Empire, this is one of the least known
and least exploited. Yet away from the depressing
and fever-smitten coast lies a magnificent hinterland
with vast tracts of forest. To penetrate into the
interior of this land was a great venture for even an
Australian girl, and few would have the heart to
make it despite the feminine allurement of diamonds.
She was, in fact, the first woman who did attempt
it, and after six months’ absence succeeded in
returning to Georgetown, if not rich beyond the
dreams of avarice, at least with a nice parcel of
the stones to dispose of and in possession of the
title to claims that promised to pan out rich. The
story is supplemented by numerous photographic
illustrations.
The Life and Letters of Walter II. Pape, by Burton
J. Hendrick (Cornstalk Publishing Co.). Readers ot
the previous collection of Page’s letters will,
with the help of the present volume of intimate cor-
respondence, forge the missing links in the relations
between President Wilson and the American Ambas-
sador. These letters were not earlier available for
publication, but the death of the President has
removed the obstacle. The outstanding idea con-
veyed is that in Walter Page England found a
friend so imbued with sympathy for her people and
her cause that he became less the representative of
American citizens than the enthusiastic pleader for
the allied arms. That his country did not enter the
war at an earlier stage was due not to any lack
of urgent representation on the Ambassador’s part,
but to the real or assumed necessity for restraint till
the propitious moment had arrived —a necessity that
seemed obvious to Wilson on the spot but was not so
clearly manifest to Page at the Court of Sr.
James. The two men had much in common; both
were drawn from the old Southern States, a bond
in itself long after the strife that once divided
North from South. Also they came closely together
in the field of letters ; but whereas one passed into
the comparative seclusion of academic life, the
other entered the active world of journalism, and
thus touched human interests more closely. It is
not surprising, therefore, that their outlooks became
divergent. The final strain between President and
Ambassador appears to have been a matter of tem-
perament. What Page would have done earlier under
the influence of an emotional thrust, Wilson did later
on the cold constraint of reason. It might almost
be said that the American Ambassador during the
years of war was more English than the English.
He found in them “the only invincible thing in
Europe.” Wilson, on the other hand, was an Ameri-
can, saturated with the Monroe doctrine, ever balanc-
ing the influences that were dragging his people
into the whirlpool of foreign politics. In the end
the larger views prevailed. America could no longer
stand a mere philosophical spectator. The book is
interesting not only for the psychological insight it
conveys, but for the many crisp suggestions of
character in its pages, dashed off and vivid. So
we get a little picture of W. M. Hughes, among
many others —of Hughes with the warts left in.
Apart from the contents of this volume, it has a
local significance; it has been printed and issued
simultaneously in Britain, the United States and
Australia. To the enterprise of Angus and Robert-
son, of Sydney, is due the fact that our continent
is bracketed with the oMer countries.
Frank Harris hurls a curse from Nice: —
In my 50 years of writing I have never seen such
a brainless attack as that of Jack Lindsay (R P.
28/9/’25) on myself and my work in “My Life and
Loves” and elsewhere. Goethe says that “The praise
of the Wise is not as convincing a proof of great-
ness as the bitter dislike that Mediocrity cherishes
for everything above itself.” The point Lindsay
praises in Casanova —that he differentiates between
all the women he loved —is absolutely false. That is
what I haw tried to do; but, save in the case of
Henriette and one English girl, Casanova never even
tried to discriminate between his loves. My Portraits,
too, are “poor,” Mr. Lindsay considers. Bernard
Shaw calls me “a greater Plutarch,” and both
Mencken in America and Shaw in England agree that
some of my Portraits are the best in literature! 1
do not believe —I cannot believe —that even so un-
balanced a person as Jack Lindsay can have read
the Portraits of Maupassant and Lord Randolph
Churchill, in the second volume of “My Life,” with-,
out seeing that they are about the best Portraits ever
written! I do not believe that Lindsay has ever read
the second volume of “My Life.” To go off at half-
cock and spout brainless nonsense gives an excellent
idea of the unknown son of a distinguished father!
Where Eagles Build, by W. M. Fleming (Mills
and Boon: Angus and Robertson). “Yes,” said the
newehum, “the pioneers are the eagles. Without
them the small fry would never be heard of or seen.”
Tlfe Australian station life of the earlier days con-
tained much more of the picturesque than is
found in it to-day unless one goes far north and
west, which possibly accounts for the action of
this Australian story being cast back into the days
of the eagle. Mr. Fleming’s novel is a worthy
addition to the rapidly filling shelf of good Australian
work that is winning us a place in the literature
of fiction. The author knows his Australia at first
hand, and the sketches of character incidental to
the working out of the story will be recognised
as typical of the bush. The plot does not depend
on sensational action, but is all the stronger for
being worked out on consistent and convincing
lines. The love story holds its place, but does not
absorb the reader’s interest to the exclusion of
other themes, such as the development of the life
of the raw Scotch lad acquiring experience as a
jackeroo. It is a good, breezy yarn, with the scent
of the bush, and crowded with pictures of its trials
and fortunes.

Absolution.
Because she was so slim and fair,
The morning lustre on her hair,
The morning laughter in her eyes
His heart grew very still and wise.
Languid and green the valley lay,
Breast-naked to the kiss of day,
Her loose cloak all of shining leaves,
Her soft head crowned with yellow sheaves.
But sweeter than the morning’s smile
Was hers who walked a silver mile;
The happy wind, the chill caress,
Blew rippling laughter from her dress.
He who had been by lauds and seas
And walked with haunted memories
And touched despair and kissed regret
Sought in this valley to forget.
A silver mile they went together
In the clean dew and merry weather;
And all their speech words
Was lighter than the flight of birds.
The sun came up and climbed a tree,
Branch by dark branch, till he was free
Of shadows and his arrows flew,
Gem-pointed, in the grass and dew.
Then for a golden mile they saw
The whitened tassels of the straw,
Across a field of ripening wheat,
Bow ear to ear the wind to greet.
A grey thrush in the bushes sang,
Through lisping leaves a cow-beli rang;
And then they parted at the bend
Of a green road, their journey’s end.
Because she was so slim and fair
The world was full of sweeter air;
And he who lived with old regret
Found a great leisure to forget.
The little lauds, the foolish seas
Were lighter than one passing breeze
That blew the spindrift of a curl
About the bright head of a girl.
A silver mile they walked together,
A golden mile in brightening weather;
And he of grace must still remember
One gallant morning in December.

The Narrow Street.
Flanked by gar. tens neat,
Far from bush and sea,
Drowsing in the heat
Lies a little street
Fashioned narrowly.
Patient are the folk
Toiling, dwelling there,
Hearts they have of oak;
Sobs they strive to choke,
Smiles to ever wear.
Flowers of every hue
From their gardens start,
Blessed by sun and dew;
And a garden, too,
Seems each dweller’s heart.
All are friends, and all
Kind and neighborly,
And if want befall,
Or if sickness call,
Swift with ministry.
In that narrow street,
Flanked by houses low,
Ceaseless is the beat
Of the people’s feet,
Passing to and fro.
Blind is he, or fool,
Who forbears to smile,
There at evening cool,
When, new come from school,
Children dance u while.
Though no singing bird
Haunting bush and tree
In that street is heard,
Still ’tis often stirred
By high melody.
From a near-by park,
O’er that narrow street,
’Twixt the dawn and dark,
Soars at times a lark,
Dropping music sweet.
As it mounts on high,
Like a singing star,
Circling, soaring by,
Ear and heart and eye
All enchanted are.
Gay with dancing feet
And that skylark’s song,
To that narrow street,
Drowsing in the heat,
Blessings twain belong.

Not for me a roof-tree, child or lover,
But only this white room
And all the patient stars
Peering through the bars
Into my prison’s gloom—
This whiteness, and the magic night for
cover.
Not for me the smooth delight of leaping
Into the water clear—
Only the chair’s restraint,
The brilliance of white paint,
Not sunlight like a spear
To stir the waters and my soul from sleeping!
Not for me a roof-tree, child or lover.
This is. my fate. For me
To grow old and lined,
Knowing love only kind,
Tasting no ecstasy.
Night, gently bend and lend me of your cover.

A DEATH’S HEAD AT THE FEAST.
Ex-Premier Barwell, of South Australia,
has bloomed into a Senator, and his friends,
according to the rules of the game, invited
him to a snack by way of commemoration.
He proved a skeleton at the feast and a
death’s head in presence of the sandwich.
The topic on which he spread himself was
the monetary woes of his State. On this
he seems to have discoursed as if debt was
an unavoidable calamity, due to the act of
Gon rather than the shirking of man —man
in this connection including one Henry
Barwell, who did his full share in his own
sphere, and a little more. The habit of de-
pending on loans, and the habit of not know-
ing what to do save perish as soon as the
loan business fails, appeared to strike the
ex-Premier as in the category of fixed dis-
pensations ; and this was his only and un-
helpful prescription:—
There were ahead times of serious stress and diffi-
culty owing to the financial position of S. Australia.
If things continued as at present he was afraid the
time was not far off when that State would have to
consider the question of unification as the only
solution of its difficulties. He feared the financial
strangulation of the States. He considered that
unification, while it might temporarily solve the
financial difficulties, would ultimately act most detri-
mentally to the interests of Australia as a whole,
and of the smaller States in particular.
Harwell is not one of the Red Brigade which
wants bankruptcy as an aid to revolution
and a means of banging the “capitalist,” and
which borrows its hardest when in power
with a view, among other things, to hasten-
ing the end. Henry, the Knight, is rather
an unusually outspoken member of the large
class which foresees a crash which it dreads,
and yet floats big loans out of custom, and
lest, by not doing so, it should be distanced
in the race for office. It is a quaint sugges-
tion that the Federation should commit sui-
cide to save itself, and should rush into a
course which will be “most detrimental” in
order to avoid detriment. But the tendency
to hunt after some substitute —in fact, after
any old substitute —for hard work and
economy has taken root.
* * » . « V.
Unification is on the programme of the
worst crowd in Australia, and it- has been
there ever since that crowd became worst.
It belongs to the party which was anti-
British and anti-Australian during the war,
which objects to civilisation and self-govern-
ing institutions, and has a grudge against
humanity, a dislike to the solar system and
a “derry” on the universe. The basic idea
is that if there is only one head it is easier
to cut off, which was also the view of a
Roman emperor—the gentleman who made
his horse a priest and had tortures performed
during dinner. When the State Legislatures
are gone there will be only two Houses of
Parliament. When the Senate is wiped out
by a coup d’etat of some sort, possibly based
on a referendum with a sliding panel in the
ballot-box, there will be only one House. And
if Communism gets control of that for long
enough to perfect its arrangements for count-
ing the vote in future, there will be, to all
intents and purposes, no House at all. With
this purpose to serve, the worst crowd in
Australia is never tired of depicting a cheap,
pure and ideal form of self-government with
a subdivided land run by county councils in-
stead of by State Parliaments. This is in-
tended, of course, to be the absolute anti-
thesis of self-government, the county councils
being created on the methods of the one cen-
tral authority, and having no rights or status
which the one central authority can’t take
from them at any hour of the day or night.
But the Communist finds an ineffable charm
in the idea of a multitude of little ruling
bodies, each with a carefully-manipulated
Communist majority, and all the majorities.,
making a good thing out of it at once, j
* -* * * ■ ' ‘ \ • ‘
In order to attract support for their
scheme the schemers circulate vague but-
amazing tales about the unparalleled num-
erosity, in proportion to population, of Aus-
tralia’s legislatures and legislators, and their
astounding cost, and the number of houses
or grand pianos each Australian could buy
with his share of the money if the cost was
saved. And the same idea has become a,
potent fad and a fixed delusion in Tory
circles, too. It has done this to such an extent
that there is hardly a populated first-class
railway carriage, or a smoking-room in
steamboat Or club, where there isn’t at; least
one animated receptacle for rich food ready
to dilate on the subject at great length and
short notice. As a matter of fact, consider-
ing the size of the country, and even con-
sidering the size of the nation, Australia’s
governing apparatus is simple and modest
when placed alongside many others. The
cost of 13 Houses of-Parliament, seven Gov-
ernors, seven Ministries, with railway passes,
Parliamentary officials, refreshment rooms,
Ha NS arp, elections, referenda, royal and
select and badly-selected committees, light,
power, heat, postage-stamps and sundries, was
3s. sd. per inhabitant in 1924, though in one.
previous year it was 4s. Id. If this was all
saved the number of houses the allegedly
much-wronged and robbed inhabitant, could
buy, or even the number of lame horses he
could back, with the saving would be infini-
tesimal. A robust outfit of county councils
(Communist pattern) would probably steal
as much or more in a month, possibly under
the pretence of buying a coalmine or estab-
lishing a power-house.
* * * *
South Australia, where ex-Premier Bar-
well broods in melancholy, is the most in-
debted State, per inhabitant, in the Com-
monwealth, , Westralia excepted. It attained
that disgraceful position in 1909, when it
beat Queensland for second place. The
transfer of certain liabilities to the Com-
monwealth in 1913 put S.A. back in its old
situation of third worst, but its rulers hated
to languish in comparative obscurity. By
manful borrowing and tireless pursuit of
insolvency it was back in second place as
early as 1916. On June 30. 1924 (the aggra-
vating Statistical Department is still at
anchor there), Barwell’s State owed
£127 13s. sd. per head, which was £2B 3s. sd.
more than the very bad average of the six
States. At June, 1920, about the time when
the Harwell reign began, the debt was
under £lOO per head, and the State wasn't
anything like so far ahead of the lamentable
procession. Wherefore the legal knight
spared no effort in digging the hole S.A. is
alleged to inhabit. If the unspeakable sin
and folly of unification came about, one re-
sult would be that S.A. would only owe
the average, instead of owing a good deal
more than the average; but the debt would
remain, also the loan habit, and Australia
would have admitted itself a record failure.
* * • •
There are various things which might be
done or attempted, now that the community
begins to realise the vast possibilities of
bankruptcy in some form if nothing is done.
An obvious‘ proceeding would be for the
Commonwealth to exercise, as far as pos-
sible, its neglected right to take over the old
State debts. If the process seems too com-
plicated it might at least take over the £75
or so per inhabitant which Victoria owes,
and a corresponding amount of the liabilities
of the other States. Then it could enter on
a vigorous process of reduction. This and
the payment of interest would involve the
stoppage of the ridiculous 255. per head sub-
sidy, probably the stoppage or strict limita-
tion of that obvious failure, the baby bonus,
and certainly some oxfra taxation to boot;
but financial revolutions can’t be made with
rose-water. And as revenue collected here
in local paper is useless for the payment of
gold liabilities abroad, it might be necessary
to take strenuous measures to get gold. This
might lead to the Government turning mer-
chant, buying up for export a sufficiency of
produce here with its paper revenue, and
turning the same into good legal tender at
the other end. The result to the producer
here would be the same as it is now,
but there would be a difference to the im-
porter, for a large sum which now comes back
in the shape of fluff and other wares, to the
damage of local industry, would return in-
stead in the shape of a receipt for interest
and for a bit of principal. But the importer
doesn’t matter. Having got so far the
Federal authority might then think over
ways and means qf taking over more of the
State liabilities, and of putting the brake
on new State borrowings, especially abroad.
Australia can do with a unified public debt,
and a unified railway system might not be
amiss.- As for a unified continent, the urgent
meed is for more States-—not fewer.
A NEW LINE IN CROCODILE TEARS.
Australia rejoices in a so-called Town and
Country League which is issuing bushels of
Foreign-trade propaganda. “Rejoices” is
the right word, for the League’s effusions,
whether read by themselves or contrasted
with the solid arguments for Protection which
constantly appear in good old Foreign-trade
newspapers, are adding materially to the
gaiety of the nation. Two of its 27 members
recently regaled the Prime Minister with
-what they described as “a protest against
the tariff now awaiting the endorsement of
the Commonwealth Parliament.” Another
signatory to the “protest” was the presi-
dent of the Vic. Farmers’ Union, whose dash-
ing young Cobdenites have been conspicuous
in the fight for high Customs duties on
butter, cheese, eggs, honey, maize, hops,
onions, dried fruits, citrus, raisins, currants
and other heavily protected varieties of
primary produce. The Priminister was
assured that “never in the history of tariffs
has there been such a general outcry from
overseas traders as that evoked by the Tariff
Bill introduced in the last Parliament.” Cham-
bers of commerce, manufacturers’ associa-
tions, the National Federation of Hosiers “and
various, other important bodies of Great Bri-
tain” were represented as burning so fiercely
syith indignation that it was doubtful if they
' Could be put out. The Financial News was
'quoted to show that Australia should go
baldlieaded for “agricultural settlement” and
stop its “silly little nibblings with tariffs.”
It was likewise suggested that, in trying to
establish manufactures by means of Protec-
tion, the Commonwealth was brutally un-
grateful to the" British Government —a Gov-
ernment which is itself Protectionist, by the
way,, though its hands are tied, for the time
being, by an unwise election pledge.
* * * *
Unfortunately for the Town and Country
Leaguers, a representative of the British
Government, Sir Frank Heatii, secre-
tary of the British Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research, was in Australia
when their lucubration was. published. He
was invited here by the Bruce-Page Govern-
ment to study what has been done in the
way of scientific research as applied to in-
dustry, and to suggest plans for improve-
ment and for closer co-operation in this re-
gard between Britain and Australia ; and lie
is returning home with no respect for the
theories of our Calico Jimmies. Addressing
the. Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, he de-
clared that “wonderful work” had been ae
complished by Australians “in the production
of high-class wools, and still more wonderful
w r ork in the breeding and production of
wheat.” But he pointed out that “only one
primary industry (dairying) has increased in
bulk,” notwithstanding the hundreds of mil-
lions lavished on “agricultural settlement,"
'especially since the war. And he reminded
Australia that “it is more economic to grow
two blades of grass where one grew before
than to increase the area under cultivation.”
The Calico Jimmy idea is that increase of
the area under cultivation is the only thing
that matters —that Australia should concen-
trate on “filling our vast spaces with indus-
trious producers” regardless of whether the
said producers have any pioney of their own,
any experience in cultivating spaces, vast or
otherwise, or any prospect of finding a profit-
able market for their produce, in which re-
spect thousands of existing “producers” have
been let down by the fools and knaves who
encouraged them to fill spaces. Sir Frank
Heath continued in a strain which must
have caused considerable astonishment in
the Argus office when his words were set up:
I am in strong sjanpathy with Australia in her
desire to develop her secondary industries. There is
an argument in its favor which is not political and
not economic. The argument which I put forward
is intellectual. It is that the secondary industries
of a country give scope to a type of intellectual
activity, fundamentally scientific, which the primary
industries in themselves can never do. They give
an opening to a highly trained type of mind without
which a modern hation cannot fully develop itself.
Every nation must have within itself the means of
facing the problems which may arise when it comes
to the arbitrament of arms. Knowledge is hot. a
thing that you can buy from the other fellow like
a pound of butter. Knowledge has to be made
where it is psed, and it must be as wide, as com-
plete, and as full as possible. If a nation advisedly
sets itself out merely to be a producer of the fruits
of the earth it will not have the necessary intellec-
tual capacity for fulfilling all the duties of nation-
hood.
The intellectual argument is doubtless unin-
telligible to the gentlemen of the Town and
Country League. But on this phase of the
subject the British scientist has left nothing
to be said.
* * * *
Another grievance of the ’f’own and Coun-
try League is that the franjers of the new
tariff (which is a good tariff as far gs it
goes, though it doesn’t go far enough) had
only Australian interests in mind, whereas
they should have been tenderly regardful of
foreign interests. It is complained that tin 1
tariff is a “hostile response to a gesture of
friendship on the part of a great nation” —
Protectionist France, to wit. The gesture
of friendship was a visit from a French mis-
sion, and trade missionaries are pure altru-
ists, as everyone knows; nevertheless, the
callous Australian Government “imposed
extra duties on several of the manufactures
in which France rightly claims to special-
ise.” _ There is an interesting commentary
on this silly wail in the report from France
that the textile manufacturers of the De-
partjpent of the Nord, who are the objects
of the Town and Country League’s sym-
pathy, have taken the lead in a move to solve
the French financial problem by guarantee-
ing a loan of 400.000,000 dollars, designed
to establish a great sinking fund and save
the franc. This shows that the French tex-
tile manufacturer is in no danger of being
ruined by Australia’s latest attempt to get a
little more of its wool made up in its own
mills, and is well able to look after himself.
It likewise shows that a manufacturing in-
terest, adequately protected at the Customs
and nourished by patriotism, is a source of
strength to the State as well as a source
of economic wealth. Australia can learn a
similar lesson from the Protectionist Repub-
lic on the other side of the Pacific. The
immense post-war prosperity of the U.S.A.
dates from the enactment of the Fordney-
McCumljer tariff,, which was introduced at
a time when there were more unemployed in
Coolidge’s country than there were in
Britain. Reporting at the end of .1925
Hoover, the Secretary of Commerce, stated
that wages were higher and prices lower than
in 1920; indeed, “the position of the indus-
trial -worker should be five or six times as
good as before the war.” Direct taxation has
been substantially reduced, and in five years
there has been a decrease in the U.S. debt
from five billions sterling to four billions.
So the U.S.A. can also dispense with the
Town and Country League’s sympathy. For,
ridiculous as it seems, the League hotly pro-
tests against the tariff wall being raised
against the greatest of all Protectionist coun-
tries, which sells us £5 worth of goods for
every £1 worth of Australian goods it buys
THE CABLES.
In the cold official statement that one of the
Tasmanian cables is interrupted and that the
C. S. Iris is hastening to the rescue some
romance is hidden.
Even the man who works the cables forgets
their existence until some phenomenon inter-
rupts their respectable behavior. He speaks
of the fellow at the other end usually with
loathing and contempt, as if no stretch of
ocean intervened. He curses London on the
keys with the same personal enthusiasm iie
employs for the RQ clerk standing at his
elbow. Nevertheless the cable is leading,
in 'its garden of elegant sea-flowers, a life
of- its Own which 10 years hence, or maybe
20j some ship’s electrician will read as easily
as an extract from a diary. Sometimes a
shark tries the savor of this interminable
steel eel and leaves a tooth in the outside
sheathing; once a whale was found dead with
an iron and percha necklace round its neck;
the anchors of dragging ships find an inter-
national route good holding ground; but
moi;e often it is the slow chafing of rocky
shelves or steady chemical corrosion which
causes the cable to suffer a sea-change.
The early types of cable, not being served
with brass tape, the teredo borer found to
his liking. He made pinhole, entrances which,
while letting out the- electricity sufficiently
to upset the working, presented to the shore
electrician a baffling problem in localisation.
For, contrary to popular opinion, the cable-
ship, when setting out to repair a faulty or
broken cable, does not put the shore-end
across its arm and follow it out to sea. Such
was the original notion even of cable-layers,
and many million pounds’ worth of copper
and gutta-percha were left on the bottom of
the Atlantic in consequence. It was not
long, however, before science partly
triumphed over a complicated problem. By
applying a current to the damaged cable and
measuring its amount, the electrician was
able to judge how much of the wire remained
in circuit or where part-of the current was
finding a path to earth. In the early days
the cable electrician was the sport of im-
ponderable factors. His readings were
vitiated by currents set up by the earth, by
the injudicious activity of sun-spots, by the
fireworks exhibitions of the aurora australis
and by electric batteries made up of the
broken cable itself in contact with salt water.
A bubble of hydrogen forming at the punc-
ture would one moment place the apparent
position of a fault in the next room and
anon one hundred miles over the horizon.
Consequently the expert was subject to gross
pagan superstitions which he called his
“judgment” and his “experience.” When
these deities were complaisant the ship
brought the fault inboard at the first
grappling and the electrician said: “I told
you so!” When they were angry or indif-
ferent they set the ship dragging the ocean
bed for weeks and then revealed that the
fault was in the investigator’s own office.
On one occasion a ship was fetched 5000
miles’to mend an Australian cable. Cutting-
in according to instructions 70 miles from
the land, she found the fault still inshore.
She cut-in 30 miles nearer and still found
it inshore. She approached as near as her
draught would let her and still found the
trouble shoreward. Then a shore electrician
started digging in the sand and found some
householder, in disposing of a dead cow, had
thrust his spade through the cable.
To-day, thanks to a test devised by a
Maorilander and now in world-wide use, the
distance of a fault or break from shore can
be calculated sometimes to within a sixth of
a mile. The ship is supplied with the read-
ing and. having a profound contempt for all
shore electricians, proceeds to any spot but
the one indicated. Dropping a buoy a mile
or so from the known route of the cable,
she pays out a grapnel. Many and ingenious
are the shapes of these mechanical fingers
which grope over the bottom of the ocean
with almost a human sensibility. When the
cable lies at depths of over a mile —2500
fathoms is not unusual —picking it up in-
volves the lifting of a bight several miles
in length and weighing many tons. The
deep-sea cable is comparatively frail, and
sometimes worn. It might part before u
reached the plunging bows of the vessel.
Therefore the grapnel sent down will be or
a kind which briskly bites through the cable
when it touches it, spits out the unwanted
end and brings up the other to the surface.
The staff above are anxiously watching the


dynamometer, an instrument which registers
the strain but which the old hand despises,
preferring to put his trust in his sensitive
hams by squatting on the rope as it conies
up over the bows. The electrician is in Ins
counting-house, eager to get to Avork, but the
captain is on the bridge looking at the sky.
He may give instructions to buoy and leave
the catch until the weather is more pro-
pitious. If his ship is under daily charter
by another administration he is apt to show
extraordinary caution.
Meanwhile the shore staff has been taking
it in turns sitting in a darkened room
watching a spot of light. The coy wooing
of a mermaiden seems to be registered by
the maunderings of that chancy gleam which
records the movements of a magnetic coil
connected to the cable. When the ship hooks
the other end it will probably register violent
perturbation. In the old days before wire-
less came to put the ship in independent
touch with the land, ship-watching was an
anxious time, reducing superintendents to
nervous prostration. On one occasion a ship
grappled for a cable running out of Sydney
for tAvo months before she found it.
When the ship gets the end on board she
bares the copper conductor, joins it to her
speaking set and sends out a peremptory
and unsentimental hail. The shore staff
usually flies off its head. Cable ships at
sea cost in. the neighborhood of £3OO a day,
and their importance should not be under-
rated. By the ship staff it never is. I have
known three ships to be simultaneously
clamoring for attention at the same testing
table and not one of them to be denied. A
shore watcher on one occasion, lulled by the
rhythmic wavering of the earth currents,
fell asleep and woke to find the ship calling
furiously. The first message he had the privi-
lege of receiving was a telegram to his main
office asking for his head. He now keeps
bees up Cootamundra way.
If tests show the fault to lie inshore the
ship picks up towards it; if the cable is
quite sound, she buoys the end and steams
off to grapple for the other. Although the
formula of the Maorilander aforesaid made
the tracing of a minute puncture in the
dielectric of a cable a thousand miles in
length almost fool-proof in ordinary circum-
stances, it is still liable to strange aber-
rations. Its incalculability even preyed on
the brilliant mathematical mind of its in-
ventor. In his declining years he was sus-
pected of strange practices contrary to
science. After a long night spent in trying
to localise a break by means of his own
formula he was found with the splice-list,
or statistical record, of the broken cable
open before him. His eyes were shut, his
lips were moving, presumably in prayer,
and under his fingers revolved a plancliette.
Having recovered the second end, the ship
cuts-in again and wakes the other station
out of its slumbers. Abandoning the faulty
portion, she joins on fresh cable out of her
tanks and returns to the buoyed section.
A final test to see that all is O.K. and she
kisses good-bye to either station, thanks
them politely for their attention and in-
structs them to call each other in sixty
minutes. Then the jointer applies his hands
to magic, a perfect splice is made and the
cable splashes back into its slimy bed.
Before the ship has finished gathering up the
paraphernalia Avhich a week or so of unre-
mitting labor has scattered over the ocean,
the clerks in Australia have resumed hos-
tilities Avith their London colleagues.
C. Q.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Hun Post-mortem.
The official inquiry why Germany was defi-
nitely licked by the Allies in 1918 is a be-
lated washing of torn linen. It raises the ques-
tion why one or the other wasn’t licked much
earlier, and whether an earlier establishment
of the unified command would have done it,
seeing that the unified commander, happening
to be the right man, changed what looked like
almost definite defeat for the Allies into vic-
tory inside seven months. Probably the most
convincing tale on the Hun side was that
Avritten by Grand Admiral von Tibpitz, and
dated April, 1919. Tibpitz was to a
great extent the creator of the Hun navy,
but he Avas turned into a shore officer as
Naval Secretary of State, and got no chance
to take his pet creation into battle. He was
a brilliant liar about many things; but when
he denounced the naval authorities, from the
Kaiser downward, his tale took on a sem-
blance of probability. The Hun’s original
and best hope, he held, lay in taking a big
chance on the sea. But while the Kaiser was
willing to risk his armies like any other com-
mander, because Prussia was accustomed to
have armies, he had a dread of risking his
fleet, because it was the first and only Prus-
sian fleet that ever was, and he viewed it
partly like a saint contemplating his one
chance of Heaven, and partly like a widowed
lien considering her solitary chicken. Where-
fore the human race saw a staggering spec-
tacle. The war lasted over four years. On
the very first day, and every subsequent day,
it Avas essential for the Hun to make a bid
for command of the sea, the highway for the
Allied troopships and provision fleets; but
so little bid was made that the world’s second
biggest navy was practically intact, and all
ready to be surrendered, when the collapse
came. It would have rounded off the story
if the army had also been ready for sur-
render in an undamaged condition. The view
of Tibpitz is that both Germany and Britain
had ships in course of construction when the
war broke out, but that Britain had much
the larger number, and that as both sides
hustled their vessels to completion the Hun
cnance grew smaller. The war was close on
two years old, and the crews of the Hun
home-staying fleet had had time to go some-
Avhat to seed, when the first fighting naval com-
mander-in-chief, Von Scheeb, got a chance
to fight the one big sea-battle of the war off
Jutland. On the mere count of losses it isn’t
certain that the Von didn’t win that battle.
But, according to the embittered Tib-
pitz, the Khiser and his nervous advisers
ordered that their priceless marine jewel must
avoid risks for the future, and lead a guarded
and pottering life, and wait for the enemy
to come along and commit suicide. The
enemy didn’t, perhaps because he began
to realise that that kind of fleet might ulti-
mately be got for nothing. The war was four
years old, and was visibly lost, and the per-
sonnel of the home-staying fleet had moul-
dered in almost complete retirement, when
it got the order to go out and be young and
fresh and enthusiastic, and do mighty deeds.
It refused unanimously, having no enthusiasm
left. But even if it had gone out to fight
then instead of going into mutiny, and
even if it had Avon a bright and unex-
pected victory, it would have been too late.
The huge land guns which the war had
evolved would have battered it to pieces if
it tried to crowd through the Strait of Dover.
The supremacy which the Allies had secured
in the air would have enabled them to drop
almost everything mentionable and unmen-
tionable on Fbitz from above. And the
Allies, by developing “a war of frightfulness”
or otherwise, would have pushed their way
into possession of the German ports. Then
they would have lived on the land till the
Hun fleet, worn out Avith being a homeless
floating republic, came back, and Avas arrested
for non-payment of alimony to the frau it
left behind it. So perhaps the best thing that
the Hun War Post-Mortem Board can do is
just to bring in a verdict that the Hun naval
collapse of 1918 had no parallel in history,
and that the Ilun military collapse of ISO 6
was a fool by comparison. And it might add
a few words to the effect that when Fbitz
does a thing he does it thoroughly.

Lang’s Talc for the Marines.
Last month N.S.W. Premier Lang spoke
scornfully of persons who ‘’occasionally level
adverse criticism against the extensive
borrowing by the State.” Declaring that the
N. S. Wales public debt on June 30 was
£205,275,000, of which £114,847,000 had been
spent on railways and tramways, he main-
tained that “if the raihvays and other ser-
vices were sold to private enterprise, a very
much larger sum than the whole of the public
debt would be realised.” And he laid down
the principle that “if the State is to pro-
gress, then loans must be raised, with a con-
sequent annual increase in the public debt.”
Last week the same gentleman, when ques-
tioned about his proposal to “take over” the
motor-’buses in the County of Cumberland,
again suggested that the nefarious capitalist
Avas thirsting to buy the Government rail-
Avays and tramways, “an asset which would
more than pay off the national debt.” Then,
being an impulsive gentleman and illogical,
he said that the position as regards portion
of the “asset” was as follows (S. M.
Hebald’s account) :
The Commissioners had reported that the position
of the tramways was becoming untenable. The ’buses
were removing the trams off the streets without
compensation, and the public and taxpayers had to
face an annual loss of over £ 100,000, which, it was
stated, would increase each year. The Commissioners
had requested the Government to allow them to run
’buses here and there, on various routes. Instead of
tinkering with the subject, the Government decided
to ask the Commissioners to report on the matter,
to make the position clear whether the ’buses should
go or the trams should go, or whether they were
prepared to run the whole of the ’bus services.
The exact loss on the N.S.W. Government
tramways for 1924-25 was £102,079. On
June 30 capital expenditure amounted to
£11,131,454, and the staff —exclusive of those
employed on the construction of neAv lines —
numbered 10,708. Working expenses totalled
£3,174,802, of which £2,089,473 went _ in
wages and salaries. Since then the Avorking-
Aveek has been reduced from 48 hours to 44,
which Labor gift to the employees will cost
approximately £lOO,OOO per annum, xvliile
Workmen’s Compensation benefits have been
substantially increased and an unemployed-
insurance scheme is on the way. In the
circumstances the idea that the trannvays
could be sold for a lot more than they
cost is fantastic, unless avc are prepared to
concede that State ownership and manage-
ment is so ghastly a failure that private
enterprise can get infinitely better results —
can. in fact, turn a heavy loss into a large
profit. Unless that admission, utterly damn-
ing to the Labor policy, is made, an offer
of even £5,000,000 for a politically-controlled
concern which lost just on £2OOO a week
Avlien 48 hours were worked, and which has
been hopelessly beaten by the motor-’buses,
would be an act of insanity. As for the
railways, a surplus of £32,937 Avas shown
last year, when the 48-hour Aveek obtained.
Capital expenditure Avas £99,623,216, so the
return was equivalent to .033 per cent.,
whereas 5i per cent., free of State income-
tax, can be got by investors in Common-
wealth loans. And the Commissioners report
that a length of 3586 miles Avas Avorked at
a loss of £1,505,010. Some shocking examples
are appended:—
Length
Miles. Cost. Loss.
Murwillumbah-Grafton .. 149 £1,624,556 £146,836
Demondrille-Blayney .. 110 1,307,012 132,848
Tam worth-W allangarra . . 211 3,282,316 135,337
Joppa Junction-Bombala . . 189 2,182,599 118,599
Wagga-Tumbarumba . . 80 774,793 39,932
Kiama-Nowra .. 22 428,764 26,867
And the harvest of the 44-hour xveek is
ripening. There are ominous indications, in
some districts at least, that the motor-van
is destined to do to the goods-train what
the motor-’bus has done to the electric tram.
In any case, it is useless to continue the
pretence (and to give it as an excuse for
the degrading business of borrowing from
hard-up John Bull) that capitalists who
can get 5 or 6 per cent, for their money
anywhere, and that Avitliout exertion or
worry, would jump at the chance of paying
100 per cent, above cost for a moribund
tramway system which lost £102,079 in
1924-25, and is expected to lose £200,000
in 1925-26, and for railways Avhich returned
.033 per cent, on £99.623,216 before the
Government knocked 84 per cent, off the
working week. Nobody out of Bedlam be-
lieves it.
Sniafll.
“Tbepex” : Having now examined a sample
of the new synthetic fibre called sniafil, or
wooltex, which it is purposed to use in the
textile trade as an adulterant of or sub-
stitute for wool, I can only ask: “Why pick
on wool?” The stuff less resembles wool
than it does any other fibre I know of that
is used in the manufacture of dress materials
—cotton, flax, mohair, camel-hair or any-
thing else. Unless it can be shown to take
similar dyes to wool or to possess equal spin-
ning properties it will have a poor chance
of successful competition. Wool is primarily
a fibre of rough cellular formation round a
central channel which runs its full length.
It is this structure which gives it both its
warmth and absorbency combined with ex-
traordinary spinning capacity. Sniafil,
which is both smooth and solid, will probably
be found to be deficient in these qualities,
with the added disabilities of harsh handling
and questionable durability. One would
think that if Germany, which had so much
need and so much opportunity to experiment
with wool substitutes, is well content to
resume heavy purchases of the genuine
article, there cannot be any serious challenge
to the paramount position of the golden
fleece. Still, it is rather early to pronounce
final judgment; there is probably room for
the use of sniafil as an adulterant of the
poorer types of wool, and this should induce
some Australian growers to take more care
and produce better fleece. Australia grows
a bigger weight of high-class wool than any
other country in the world; nevertheless be-
cause of the variety and poor quality of rams
that are employed for breeding purposes, far
too much low-grade stuff is sent to market.

Coal-mine Accidents.
The evidence of William Humble, the
veteran ex-chief inspector of N. S. Wales
coal-mines, before the Commission on Coal-
mines, is a grim comment on human reckless-
ness and self-indulgence. The expert, who
was giving evidence on the question of per-
mitting the use of naked lights in coal-pits,
laid the blame for almost every one of the
many deaths which have taken place in N. S.
Wales coal-mines on the naked light. Per-
sistence in the use of this dangerous method
Avas due, he declared, not so much to the
managements’ desire to avoid the expense
of safety-lamps as to the miners’ objection
to their use. The enclosed safety gives less
light than the open flare or candle; moreover,
the fact that it is locked prevents the man
who carries it getting a light for pipe or
cigarette, and the carrying of matches below
is forbidden under penalty. Though the wit-
ness did not mention it, two of the best-
known mines in the Cessnock district have
been idle for months because the management
has introduced the safety-lamp: the miners
contend that the inferior light of the “safety”
prevents their getting as much coal as with
the naked light. But if the “safety’s” poor
lighting is the only trouble, as the miners
allege, it is an easily-mended one. Portable
electric hand-lamps are cheap and plentiful.
In American mines the electric light is used
almost universally. It is claimed that the
wiring and lighting of mine-galleries would
be too expensive in Australia, but no one
should cavil at an expense which would pre-
vent another Bellbird or Bedhead explosion.
Best of all. the electric light is fool-proof.
The hardiest of self-indulgent asses could not
light up pipe or cigarette at an incandescent
burner, and this would cut to a minimum
what is probably the cause of seven-tenths of
mining explosions—surreptitious smoke.
Little-Australian Unionism.
The oasis in the desert of the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment’s legislation and attempted legisla-
tion is the Act imposing a 20 p.c. tax on
foreign film profits which have hitherto
escaped taxation. For this very worthy
achievement the Lang Government has been
bitterly attacked by some of the unions to
which it looks for support, notably the Theat-
rical Employees’ Union. The Theatrical Em-
ployees’ Union asserts that the impost in
ouestion is indirectly a tax on the N.S.W.
workers. It is nothing of the kind. It
is a straight-out tax on the N.S.W.
profits of foreigners who have drawn a huge
tribute from Australia and contributed far
less than their fair share of the cost of gov-
erning it, to say nothing of the perplexing
social problems created by the propagation
of Hollywood ideas of manners, morals,
patriotism and art. The expenses of these
foreigners are small—the films imported into
Australia are cheap copies of productions
which have already exploited the American,
and perhaps the British, market —and a 20
p.c. tax on their N.S.W. profits is a mere
bagatelle. Says the “Daily Mail Year
Book”:
The dividends paid by some of the biggest
American producing companies are enormous. The
Fox Film Co., for instance, declared a dividend in
1925 of 235 p.c. The Famous Lasky Co. has paid
£3,000,000 in dividends during the past six years,
besides spending as much on assets, reduction of
mortgages and so on.
It is possible, of course, that attempts will
be made to pass the tax on. The Govern-
ment will not be helpless in that event, and
if the workers are victimised it will be their
own fault. As alternatives to paying taxation
for foreign film millionaires they can support
other forms of entertainment ill which Austra-
lians are employed, or demand more Australian-
made films, to which the 20 p.c. impost does
not apply. If the pictures shown in Aus-
tralian cinema theatres were 98 p.c. Aus-
tralian and 2 p.c. foreign, instead of the
other way about, the workers would reap
most of the benefits, which would be in every
respect great. The Theatrical Employees’
Union, for one thing, would substantially
increase its membership. And the probabili-
ties are that the new members would be much
better Australians than the present control-
lers of the union, who have shown a very
poor Australian spirit in the matter of pro-
tective duties on films and the taxation of
U.S. millionaires’ Australian profits.
Queensland’s Wild Cats.
Queensland is a happy hunting-ground for
wild cats; an antiquated law allows them
to scratch for a living where and how they
please. Insurance companies have to put up
a big cash deposit before starting operations
in Queensland ; oil companies have to submit
their prospectuses to the censorship of the
Minister for Mines before publication; but
the rest of the field is open to the wild cats.
And a wide, rich field it is. The share-
buying proclivities of Queenslanders (par-
ticularly the outbackers) have earned the
gratitude of a legion of company-promoters
and their parasites. Any grafter Can launch
a wild-cat company from his hotel bedroom.
The only capital required is a good front and
plenty of impudence. A company is formed
l'or the purpose of extracting the prickles
from prickly-pear or for tanning crocodile
hides; nominal capital, £25,000 or £250,000
(it's all the same to the promoter). A soli-
citor draws up the memorandum and articles
of association, and his clerks and typists sign
as subscribe: l ? for one share each. The com-
pany is registered, and the promoter can go
ahead and sell shares. The articles set forth
a long list of “objects of the company,” but
actually there is only one object: to sell
shares. The promoter has no intention of
wasting any of the shareholders’ money on
the ostensible objects of the company; he
wants it all for himself. The first step is
to hire a motor-car; the second to engage a
team of go-getters on a commission basis;
then the share-selling campaign is started.
The money is spent as it comes in. When
no more shares can be sold, the company
fizzles out. The promoter disappears, per-
haps to bob up again a few months later
with a new company and repeat the perform-
ance. A typical wild cat was a company
formed for the purpose of manufacturing
cotton goods on a large scale, purchasing its
supplies of seed cotton from the farmers.
The company had no ginnery, no factory—
nothing but a one-room office with a few
sticks of furniture; but trifles like these did
not curb the eloquence of the go-getters. By
promising the farmers high prices for their
cotton they sold thousands of shares. Then
the company faded out in the usual way. The
opinion of the Crown Law Department was
taken on this and similar cases, but the
ruling was that nothing could be done unless
fraudulent misrepresentation was proved.
The Queensland Companies Act is hoary
with age; the principal Act was passed in
1867, and earlier Acts (still in force) were
passed in the days when the Moreton Bay
settlement was a part of N. S. Wales. Every
politician admits that the Companies Acts
ought to be consolidated, amended and
brought up to date, but successive Govern-
ments have shirked the job. Meanwhile the
wild cats flourish and multiply and ravage
the earth.
*
The Revolt Against Purity.
Those who are in touch with the N. S»
Wales courts have noted the increasing num-
ber of offenders, especially of the juvenile
class, brought before them on charges arising
out of breaches of sexual morality. Tile
seriousness of this growing evil is not so
apparent as real. The younger members of
the community are in modern days removed
from the publicity of the ordinary police
courts, and are dealt with in a court of
their own, to which neither public nor press
is admitted. This is undoubtedly good in
principle, for it saves the minor delinquents
of immuture age from handicap in their
spotless years of maturity. But it has the
effect of leaving the public in the dark as
to the general trend of criminality among
tile young. No court can, however, be
so effectually closed, where fathers and
mothers pass with their children through
its doors, as to wholly exclude the public
ear from its proceedings. There is grave
reason, then, to believe, whatever causes may
be assigned, that sexual immorality among
boys and girls ik markedly on the increase.
Recently no fewer than seven lads were con-
cerned in a sexual assault which, though not
consummated, would not so long ago have
met with swift and severe punishment. To-
day offenders of this class are sent for a
term to a State institution w r ith the praise-
worthy object of reformation —-though
whether any barracks system tends in that
direction is open to doubt. Recently also
two lads were at qr about the same time
charged with similar offences. In one case
the circumstances were such as to amount
if not to rape at least to attempted rape.
How great is the change that has occurred
in our punitive and , other methods may be
judged by the fact that only in the
last generation the Mt. Rennie youths
were hanged for an offence very little
if any more serious; and the question arises
whether we may not be allowing the pen-
dulum to swing too far the other way.
Everyone will probably have a suggested
cause for the increasing laxity. One will
attribute it to slack parental control and the
decay of home life, another to the influence
of the movies, late hours and the jazz, the
availing influence of the churches, the pro-
vocative costume of the young women, and
so on. Whatever the cause or causes may
be, the results are apparent—alarmingly
apparent. A puzzled administrator of jus-
tice who not long ago had his attention
drawn to this matter asked a mother present,
“Do you know the cause of all this?” “Oh
yes,” she said, “anyone can see that. It is
summertime, and the holidays are on and
the children must go to the beaches, and you
know what they can sec going on there any
day. They think it all right, for no one
interferes.” Probably what she meant was
not so much the actual commission of any
sexual act but the obvious and blatant pro-
vocation to it. And it is more than pos-
sible she is right. Years ago we began
mixed bathing in a revolt against prudery.
Now we appear to have reached a stage
when we are on the point of a revolt against
purity.
Murder Most Foul.
The suspicion that Victorian legislators care
less than twopence for the dwindling forests
of the State was heightened by the debate
which occupied some of the closing days of
last session. All the argument served to
reveal was that the business of forestry is
in a miserable condition, point being given
to the fact by the action of the chairman of
the Forestry Commission in tendering Ins
resignation in disgust at Parliamentary in-
difference. For a long time the indigenous
eucalyptus of the country has been almost
unknown within a wide radius of Melbourne,
and strangers could be forgiven if they prof-
fered the suggestion that the gum-tree should
be introduced from California, where the in-
habitants have grown so used to its presence
as to imagine it to be a native. The traveller
between Sydney and Melbourne who is able
to throw his mind back over 30 years or so
will see a difference in the aspect of the
countryside which is sometimes mistaken as
a change for the better. The giants that
lined the route have mostly disappeared, and
thereby given the urban scenery a specious

air of security and mellowness. But, though
the. millions of valuable native trees have
vanished, nothing has appeared to take their
place. The drying winus from the interior
sweep across a landscape which hoists no
cooling umbrella against their hungry kiss,
and the wet infrequent winds that bear clouds
from the ocean find no network of leaves
and branches to intercept their moisture.
Periodically the barren hillsides are deluged
in rains which become more torrential as
the seasons roll, and which run off
the soil like water off a well-coned
road. Highways are made impassable,
trains are derailed, sheep and cattle
drowned, townships inundated, and the news-
papers filled with accounts of thrilling res-
cues of cockies’ families from the roofs of
their ruined homes. Lifeboat crews are be-
coming as much a necessity of the economy
of Jamtin Elat as of Bondi or Sorrento; and
with every flood thousands of tons of soil are
swept off the land to silt up the watercourses.
Exact figures as to the increasing destructive-
ness of floods are not available, the period
of the white man’s occupation of this country
being short, but evidences of the effect of
indiscriminate tree-murder are evident in
little panoramas in almost every farmer’s
fields. Lacking the protecting screen of tim-
ber on his watershed, the cocky finds the
creek which trickled all the year has ceased
to run, and that the storm-water has gouged
out deep gutters across his cultivation patch.
His sloping ground has commenced to tear
and slip like rotten silk, and if he cares to
take a careful survey of the property on
which he pays an undiminished rent he will
find that the area of pasture has astonish-
ingly lessened. In the business of using
timber for domestic and industrial purposes
the position is as bad. The State that was once
covered with magnificent forest trees like
a terrier with hair is now importing nearly
as much timber as it is producing. A bene-
volent autocrat, surveying the situation,
would do several violent things. He would
compel every timbergetter to plant a tree
for every one he uprooted; he would compel
the settler, for the settler’s good, to
leave a half-dozen trees to every acre, a
belt of trees on every hilltop, and a wind-
break of foliage along his frontiers. lie
would also insist that every farmer who
lights a scrub fire to improve his feed did so
only under permit and held himself re-
sponsible for the good behavior of his con-
flagration ; and he would make every land-
owner spend a day a month or year in plant-
ing shade-trees along the sun-smitten roads
that cross the country. Unfortunately for
the democrats, democracy is better at pro-
ducing feeble talkers than benevolent auto-
crats. Also there is no adult suffrage for
trees. Consequently all the tribunes of the
people gave last session to this vital matter
was a few. hours of desultory conversation,
and \ ictoria remains in the position of being
the craziest spendthrift of timber in a col-
lection of States famous for profligacy.

“Hinge : Imported pests like the rabbit
and the pnckly-pear seem to have taught
Australia nothing. Many years ago the Cape
tulip (llomeria collina ) made its first appear-
ance near Mulgoa (N.S.W.). The weed,
Avhich the Boers call “tulp,” and which is
not to be confused
with the so-called
"Cape weed,” has
been responsible
for the death of
hundreds of thou-
sands of head of
stock in S’Africa.
Containing an irri-
tant poison which
has not yet been
identified, it is pro-
bably the most dan-
gerous plant from

the pastoral point of view in the world, killing
horses, cattle and sheep, and even Australian
native animals, almost immediately. About
three years ago, apparently having under-
gone a process of acclimatisation, it began
to spread in the district where it first ap-
peared. The only authority in the State
which is empowered to compel the destruc-
tion of noxious weeds is the local gov-
erning body, municipal or shire. The
Nepean Shire Council was accordingly urged to
deal with the menace, but in vain. The curse
grew thickly on the roads, and one councillor
wittily remarked that its presence saved the
salary of an impounding-officer, as no stray-
ing stock lived long enough to annoy the
ratepayers. Even when the Department of
Agriculture mildly protested against the
council’s inaction, Bumble was obdurate;
and nothing has been done to this day.

Any stick is good enough to whack the
North-South railway with. Senator Lynch
unloaded himself in the Federal House the
other day to the effect that the belief that
Asiatic countries, especially Japan, required
an extensive outlet for surplus population
was a white sheet and a melon with a candle
in it, and that Australians should give less
consideration to such a bogey. The 1925
census of Japan is just to hand. It shows
that the miserably confined and poorly
equipped group of islands now contains
59,786,000 people, an increase since 1920 of
more than ten times the entire present popu-
lation of the Senator’s own State. The
total number of subjects of the Mikado,
largely underfed and mostly overworked, now
amounts to the enormous figure of 831
millions. During the Senator’s own lifetime
this huge aggregation of humanity has found
itself so much in need of an outlet for its
surplus that it has slopped over to the extent
of 80,000 into California, where the fear that
its higher rate of fecundity would turn the
white province into a yellow colony induced
the Americans to slam the door on fresh
arrivals; some of the surplus now forms a
majority of the population of Hawaii, and
is a serious consideration in Manchuria,
Korea and the Philippines. While the
Senator has been busy with his political
career the Chinaman has been converting the
Malay States into a Chinese colony and
getting well on towards the same ideal in
French Cochin China, Siam, Burmah and
the Dutch East Indies. Even in the
Senator's own State the bogey has not been
idle. There are more colored people in tiie
tropical end of it than whites.
“Gregor” : Nothing is working more havoc
amongst our black brothers of the North
than opium. Once a native has acquired the
habit there is nothing whatever that he will
not do for a small quantity of the drug in
one of its cheaper forms, the vice being more
pronounced than it generally is with white
men, because of the abo.’s lesser moral resis-
tance. Low Chinese take advantage of this
to make a native work long hours at hard
toil for just sufficient “yen cliee,” or opium-
ash, to ease his sufferings; the black seldom,
if ever, sees the pure drug on account of
its high cost, the “raddle” that is left in
the pipe after a smoke being just as effi-
cacious. There have been cases of the de-
liberate planting of the habit by Chinese
in order that the latter may get the
victims completely within their power;
and instances of the sale of lubras
and piccaninnies for opium are much too
common, as also are cases of the native
being forced to submit to horrible perversions
in return for the drug. Now and again a
Chinese is prosecuted ;_but when this happens
only a poor penalty is inflicted, as a rule,
instead of the imprisonment without a fine
which the law should order. The Chinese is
usually quite ready to pay the fine, which
he regards as a meagre license-fee for the
securing of free labor. Australia’s treat-
ment of her abos. is a dark spot; for the
most part we have stood idly by and watched
alcohol, syphilis and tuberculosis carry off
the original owners of the country. But the
curse of opium is at least one degradation
about which something should be done to
protect the unfortunate natives of the North.
“Bouragi” : The Papuan Council has found
it necessary to pass a White Women’s Protec-
tion Ordinance to deal with offences by
natives against European women and child-
ren —offences which have become all too fre-
quent of late. Time was, and not so long
ago, when white women in Papua were safer
from dangers of this description than in
large centres of European civilisation. The
reason was obvious. From adolescence the
Papuan suffered no sex restrictions among
his own people except that he had to respect
matrimonial —-which meant proprietorial—
rights. As a consequence, relations between
the young folk of the sexes were frankly un-
moral, according to civilised ideals. Civilisa-
tion, however, decreed that such customs
must cease to exist in Papua. The Govern-
ment, it is true, abstained from ‘dangerous
interference, but the missions have devoted
themselves in Papua, as elsewhere, to
destroying native social life and cus-
tom as a preliminary to rearing a
missionary edifice on the ruins. The
trouble is that the Papuan native, with
his age-old tradition of sexual promiscuity,
has proved quite unable to stand the strain
of the new continence demanded of him by
his spiritual guardians. It is as significant
as it is regrettable that it is in Port Moresby,
oldest, most “missionised” and “civilised” of
all Papua’s communities, that the offences
with which the new Ordinance deals have
been occurring most frequently.

“Gregor”: It is an amazing thing, .con*
sidering how much wool means to Australia,
that there exists nowhere in the Common-
wealth any public or private institution for
the study of the different problems connected
with our foremost industry. Apart from
what desultory attention is given to the
matter in the laboratories of the State Agri-
cultural Departments, nobody seems specially
interested in such things, outside those whose
business it is to grow wool. None of the
universities has ever exhibited a desire to
undertake researches concerning the coun-
try’s staple product, though it offers
an excellent field for the absorption of many
of the young scientists whom the universi-
ties are turning out, and who in many in-
stances are forced abroad to find an outlet
for their talents. Wanted, some public-
spirited pastoralist or wool-merchant to start
the ball rolling with a subscription towards
the foundation of a Wool Study Institution.
The advantages arc too obvious to be worth
enumerating.

The Bruce-Pages. judging by their an-
nouncement in the Federal House the other
afternoon, are going to do the fair thing by
Dr. Smalpage and the phthisis cure he
claims to have found. He is to be given all
facilities to carry out his investigations, in-
cluding a supply of old mokes into whose
veins the tubercle bacillus is injected and
whose automatic production of an anti-
toxin to slay the invader forms the basis of
the serum. He is to get a subsidy to keep
the wolf from the door while he is at work
and six months in which to prove his claims.
If the event justifies him the Commonwealth
laboratories will set to work at producing
sufficient serum for all sufferers. On his
part the doctor has offered without any con-
dition whatsoever the. entire Australian rights
of the nostrum to the Government. This is
in refreshing contrast to the dubious twist-
ings of Spahlinger and the Labor party’s
efforts to make electioneering capital out of
the hopes and fears of invalids.

The United States is a curious mixture of
patents, billionaires, crime, cocktails and
credulity. It has just played a new joke on
itself—one that reads like a supplement to
the Book of Mormon. Out in Arizona more
or less unreliable parties have dug up, or
say they have dug up, relics including “a
cross, a crescent, a seven-branched candle-
stick, swords and certain Masonic emblems.”
They are in “cast lead,” which is poor
material to make swords out of, and are held
to be evidence that a Masonic race of Ohris-
tianised Jewhammedans from Europe founded
a kingdom in Arizona, and that it lasted
from a.d. 760 to a.d. 900. That would allow
reasonable time for the reigns of seven mon-
archs, named respectively Moss, Abraham,
Ark, Melchizadek, Exodus, Shekel and
Shewbread. It is reported that “skilled
archaeologists” of the local society on the
Stanislow are almost forced to believe, be-
cause the goods “appear to have been’ em-
bedded in stone through natural process.”
There have been no great geological deposits
since the year 900, at which date Westmin-
ster Abbey had ceased to be quite new, but
the point is worth noting all the same. The
New York Merchants’ Association, pursuing
a different line of usefulness, has called
for tenders for a reformed calendar. Plans
are said to be pouring in. One is for the
year to begin on March 21, and to consist
of ten months, with six weeks in a month
and six days in a week. The five odd days
are to belong to no week and no month, and
are to be named Christ, Columbus, Stephen-
son (after the locomotive man), Fulton
(after the steamboat man) and Henry
Ford, after the Tin Lizzie man. Seeing that
the astronomical year is 365 days 5 hours 48
minutes and so close on half a second that
the shortage is scarcely perceptible, it is a
hard thing to divide up evenly, and no tinker-
ing is likely to do much good. As a side
incident a prospector in Warwickshire
(Eng.) claims to have struck a buried deposit
of unpublished Shakspearean literature, and
has sold £82,000 worth of it in the U.S.
The U.S. specialises, for some reason or
other, in Shakspeare relics, while some
other literary treasures find it unexpectedly
cold. A priceless find of recent years, a
letter written by Judas Iscariot to Mary
Magdalene, brought absurdly small offers
from the dollar-fiends of Hail Columbia.

“Country Parent” : The Victorian school
system no doubt is perfect—for the standard
child. But children differ; and, as “Coun-
try Ped” suggests, there isn’t enough allow-
ance made for these differences. I have seen
a “dunce” of seven brought to a nervous
breakdown by lessons ahead of him—and
then develop into a bright, normal child
under a gifted Convent teacher. Another
child had frequent sick spells—colds and de-
fective hearing. The doctor said: “Post-
nasal and tonsils.” So they were taken out.
Yet back at school, off and on during the
following 18 months, deafness, colds and ner-
vous sickness kept reappearing just the same.
Six months of open air with no school have
left nerves and hearing normal. The Depart-
ment has _ a system of medical inspection :
having discovered defects it recommends
operation or glasses or what not. and sits
back satisfied. But I have a suspicion that
as well as discovering ailments the Depart-
ment causes many of them. We can no
longer believe that a child’s body and soul
are in separate compartments, the one to be
settled with pills, the other with a stick.
A department with infants of six and even
younger on its hands for the greater part of
the child’s waking hours, 20 or 30 of them
in charge of one not very child-wise or ex-
perienced teacher, however book-learned, is
taking a lot of responsibility. With all our
educational book-study there is still not
enough child-study. One reason for this may
be that the Department is staffed by men and
flappers. The married woman, the mother,
the normal, mature woman, is so penalised
and reduced in status that she is practically
excluded.
♦ -
“Umfaan”: These incessant claims about
the benefits of Esperanto recall that where-
ever nations have to mingle they evolve a
common tongue. There is ever a straining
to get back to a universal language such as
must have existed in the cradle of the human
race. Herodotus and other ancient his-
torians supply evidence that in very remote
times the nations and tribes of the Levant
conversed in a jargon allied to each lan-
guage and embracing all. The lingua Franca
of the Mediterranean littoral is the medium
of expression and barter throughout that
sea to-day; Moor, Greek, Levantine, French-
man, Tunisian and Italian meet on a common-
language level. “Pidgin” English is the
tongue of the South Sea Islands. “Kitchen
Kaffir,” a simple form of Bantu, is used by
natives of different tribes, and by white men
in converse with them, from the Zambesi to
the Cape, and is an effective medium. India,
a country of hundreds of conflicting dialects,
meets on a conversational plane with Urdu.
The quaint mixture of Dutch and English,
with a smattering of Huguenot French,
known in South Africa as the Taal or Afri-
caans, is a proof of how easy it is for
languages to be welded. The Taal is simple
and direct, and amplifies and extends itself
at will by borrowing any extra words re-
quired from either of its three generic
tongues. A common language could easily
be found for the Teutonic races were
it not that the idealising and sanctifying
of the “mother-tongue” for centuries is hard
to combat suddenly.

THE RESCUERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In acknowledging that the police had been requisi-
tioned to discover J. W. Percival, M.L.C., who was
absent when the Labor Government needed his vote
on the Leg. Council Abolition Bill, N.S.W. Premier
Lang stated that it was ‘the duty of the police to
find missing citizens who disappear under suspicious
circumstances. Mr. Percival had left his hotel in
the morning and had not returned. His friends be-
came alarmed. Foul play was even suggested.’ ‘lt
is true that several plain-clothes policemen were
asked to ascertain Mr. Percival’s whereabouts,’ said
Col.-Sec. Lazzarini. ‘As he had left certain belong-
ings at a city hotel, it was thought that possibly
he was being held by some person or persons against
his will.’ Mr. Percival explains that he went fishing.”
Said Carlo Lazz to Lang: “Jack Percival is missing:
He slept last night at Phelan’s pub—l fear some
deadly ill.
We’ve enemies as grim as Belgium had in Bissing:
Tom Henley, Hoskins, B. J. Doe and ruthless
Theo Hill.
Our Labor Daily ed. was captured by Fascisti;
Around his bowed and bloodless head their ‘new
pickhandles’ sang.
The same fell gang’s at work. My plain-clothes Hops
(sapristi!)
Will catch ’em bending—if they can,” said Carlo
Lazz to Lang.
Said Lang to Carlo Lazz: “Profound is my emotion
At learning of our cruel loss —an admirable man!
But much as 1 esteem, my Carlo, your devotion,
No Black-shirts wrought the dirty deed —I blame
the Ku-Klux Klan.
In fancy I can see their chief, a ghostly horseman,
Adjusting of the rope on which our comrade is
to jazz.
Put bloodhounds on the job! Send Mitch, and all
his force, man!
I’ll spiflicate that Ku-Klux Klan,” said Lang to
Carlo Lazz.
Said Carlo Lazz to Lang: “The Sooper and his
‘demons’
Already scour the countryside for signs of poor
old Pere.”
“No film of Harold Lloyd’s or Hine’s or Larry
Semon’s
Was ever half as funny,” said a peeler with a
curse.
“It’s bitter to be clawed by Marrickville viragoes
W r hen Labor Leagues deliberate, but keener is

Of castor-oil applied by imitation Dagoes:
“I fear the worst for Percival,” said Carlo Lazz
to Lang.
Said Lang to Carlo Lazz: “Camillo, I am wishing
You had a bit more commonsense. A telegram. ...
It reads:
‘Jack Percival is here. He says he just went fish-
ing’ —
A weight is lifted from my soul; my heart no
longer bleeds.”
“Congratulations, chief! The man from Western
Subbubs
Has rescued Jack and foiled the foul Fascismo
—that he has.”
“Your belfry harbors bats. To blazes with your
hubbubs!
I saved him from the Ku-Klux Klan,” said Lang
to Carlo Lazz.
N.S.W.
S. GUMM.
POLITICAL
POINTS
The Broken Hill Prop., in conjunction with
Rylands, Ltd., is going to manufacture wire-
netting on an extensive scale in W 7 estralia.
This move is a result of the tariff at which
W 7 estralian politicians rail, and, in a mea-
sure, of the statutory reduction of working
hours in N. S. Wales —there is no likelihood
of the 44-hour-week law being imposed on
the branch factory as it has been on the
parent works. It is also a recognition of
the very substantial progress made by the
Groperland woolgrower, especially in the last
decade. The conquest of the Wcstralian pas-
toral areas is an inspiriting chapter in the
industrial history of Australia, and it has
been achieved by men whose only request of
the State politician was to let them alone.
The Amending Crimes Bill provides against
revolutionary and murderous associations,
giving or collecting for the same (six
months), publication or sale of the books of
such associations (two years), advocating
or inciting to crime (two years), and pro-
moting a lockout or strike for the hold-up of
transport and the public services in a dis-
trict which has been proclaimed as “dis-
turbed” (one year and, in the case of a non-
Australian, deportation). But apparently all
these are maximum penalties, and the mini-
mum, in the case of a soft-hearted or soft-
headed judiciary, may be so little as not to be
worth alludine’ to. For the individual who
proposes and conspires to commit, and
teaches others to commit, every crime in the
calendar except possibly suicide (and insur-
rection against the people’s Government in-
cludes the lot) there should be a stiff mini-
mum sentence and a very liberal maximum.
Fifteen years is considered a fair thing in
the United States.
A hardy old proposition is on the Reps’,
business-paper (by Manning, of N.S.W 7 ., this
time) that the Commonwealth should con-
struct a railway from Bourke (N.S.W 7 .) to
Cloncurry (Q.). Having done all this the
work may, at some remote date, cross into
the N. Territory, or it may finish at a Gulf
port. The Bourke line never pays, and the
lines which run out into Western Queensland
are very unpayable, and Cloncurry is. dead,
and the land along most of the long track
from Bourke to Cloncurry is poor. The
undertaking would be a bigger job than the
completion of the South-to-North railway, to
which the Commonwealth is pledged, having
accepted a huge land-grant in payment; and
the Federal Government has no land of its
own to develop between Bourke and Cloncurry.
In addition, all the proposals for shifting
the Transcontinental line to suit alleged State
or private interests read rather like schemes
for turning the Commonwealth into a liar
and a thief.
The Commonwealth Shipping Line lost
£593,879 during the year which ended March
31, 1925, but if the concern had charged
itself with interest on the actual cost of the
vessels, instead of on about one-third of the
cost, the shortage would have been over a mil-
lion. Even if no interest was charged on the
loan capital and no allowance made for wear
and tear there would be a deficit. It is a very
small show now, and humps only a fraction
“A LITTLE SLOGAN NOW AND THEN ”
“Vic. Railway Commissioner Clapp released a new slogan last week extolling Ballarat’s begonias.
On the same day, Leggo and Co., of Bendigo, announced that they were shifting their canning plant to
Melbourne owing to the high freights, thus putting over 500 workers out of employment.”
BENDIGO UNEMPLOYED: “What are you going to do about it?”
OFFICE-BOY EGGLESTON : “Sh! What is mere unemployment when a new slogan is about
to be born?”
of the trade which ambles to and fro. In
1923-24, 4.981,521 tons of cargo were shipped
from Australia, and it is argued that the
competition of the Commonwealth Line got
this away rather more cheaply than would
otherwise have been the case. The quantity
received from overseas was 4,337,171 tons,
and it is also held that the competition got
this here more cheaply, so that it might com-
pete more easily with local industry. In
other words, about half the huge loss on the
Commonwealth line is a subsidy to the im-
porter. The inter-State trade, which is much
bigger than the foreign business, gains no
perceptible advantage from the line, which
seems a purposeless thing, viewed from any
angle.
Lloyd George’s not very faithful party of
40 Freetraders (in a House of Commons
which is 615 strong) became one less when
Alfred Mond went over to the Protectionist
camp. Asquith sent the defaulter, from his
eyrie among the Peers, a stately remon-
trance, but Lloyd George gave way to bitter-
ness and said the baronet, “like another
notorious member of his race, had gone to
his own place.” This may be read as an
allusion to Elijah, who went to Heaven,
leaving behind him Elisha, a distinctly in-
ferior character who had dealings with bears.
Or it may have a bearing on Paul, who saw
the light and went into the ministry, quitting
his old associates for good. An attempt may
even be made to fit the utterance on to the
case of Judas, who went to the country, the
same as Lloyd George , did in 1924, and met
mishap there. But even if L. George thinks
he was betrayed he could hardly attach such
a value to his own importance as to drag in
that parallel.
N.S.W Premier Lang, bloodhound and
estate-agent, lacks many things, but two in
particular—the dignified repose which should
mark the caste of V ere de Auburn, and the
capacity to shed an air of verisimilitude over
an otherwise bald and unconvincing narra-
tive. The idea of enlisting the police to hunt
for Percival, M.L.C., who was only taking
a day or* two off at a familiar resort 90
miles from Sydney, wasn’t reposeful. Wil-
liam Pitt wouldn’t have gone leaping and
bellowing like that, nor would Henry Parkes.
And the idea of protesting that this was
done, not because the week-ender was the
Government’s hoped-for Upper House majo-
rity, but out of fears for his safety, wasn’t
verisimilitudihous. Men, women and flap-
pers pass from view quite frequently without
Ministers scouring the country for them, and
the frequent absences of Henry Moses, before
he resigned his M.L.C.-ship at the age of 91,
roused no anxiety in Labor circles that this
paper ever heard of.
Sir Frank Heath and Victoria’s agricul-
ture expert, Dr. Cameron, the latest to
examine the patient and diagnose the trouble,
jointly and severally declare, in effect, that
there is nothing wrong with Tasmania save
atrophy of natural functions. They both
stand amazed at the spectacle of the sparsely
timbered midland areas, which ought to be
growing wheat, still devoted to grazing, as
in the days of Nebuchadnezzar. The British
scientist reckons these areas are ideal for
mass production, and Dr. Cameron affirms
that if the half-million railed and roaded
and rivered acres were in Victoria they
would not be permitted to run sheep, rab-
bits and briars for more than about five
minutes. Which is all true enough, of
course, but while a pound of wool fetches
as much as a bushel of wheat nobody can
expect the Speck's landed aristocracy to
trouble about the State’s annual railway loss
of £250,000. An extra threepenny land-
tax might do the trick, but the landed gentry
of the island still control one legislative
chamber and half the second, and an in-
creased land-tax doesn’t seem to have much
hope at present.
When Alam, the too-fluent Dubbo store-
keeper, was holding forth in the N.S.W. Leg.
Council on the virtues of York-street and
the associated banks, and his readiness to
accept a gold pass and anything else that
was being handed round, he was interrupted
by another Labor Leg. Councillor of the 1925
vintage. Hansard records the incident
thus:—
Alam: If I stand out as one Labor man among
the whole of my comrades ——
J. Keegan: Don’t call us comrades, for Heaven s
sake!
Alam: What, are you ?
Keegan: Honorable men!
“So are they all; all honorable men.”
The stop-work farce in Queensland is get-
ting beyond a joke. When the railwaymen
at Ipswich held a stop-work meeting because
a shunter had been promoted without the
union’s consent, the Labor Government tried
to pacify them by appointing a board of
inquiry. Then the men stopped work again
to discuss whether they would accept the
board. They decided that they wouldn’t, so
the Government’s peace offering was declared
black. But when the Board found in favor
of the union it was promptly declared white.
The A.R.U. nominee was thereupon promoted
for two days, when he had to turn the job
over to the permanent boss, who had returned
from leave. All the stopAvork meetings, the
deputations, board of inquiry, fuss and fury
were over a wretched little _ stop-gap job of
acting-supervisor of a shunting yard !
Much shifty dodging has come to pass by
reason of the shipping companies’ announce-
ment that they will refuse to further employ
men who have the habit of holding up ships.
At a seamen’s nieeting in Melbourne “loud
cheers were given when it was stated that
an example should be made of those men
who delayed ships through being drunk.” But
nothing is given except the cheers. An
example isn’t made, and the owners’ offer
to make one is treated as if it was an out-
rage. The crew is never all away at once,
but there are always one or two or three
(not the same orfe or two or three) who
aren’t back from drinking or concealment.
The job-controllers on board refuse to let
the vessel sail one thirst short, and they
refuse to let a sober main be shipped in lieu
of the thirst. So the plain truth is that
the man ashore is stopping nothing larger
than a beer or two, while the ship is stopped
by the sober men on board.
The two-headed penny is in common use
in the Postmaster-General’s department, it
seems; and, of course, it is the public that
pays out. In his annual report, tabled last
week in the House of Reps., Gibson, P.M.G.,
confessed that some of his officials belong
to two or more unions, and thus enjoy the
advantages of several awards. They claimed
shorter hours under one award and extra
pay for Sundays under another. No wonder
the wages bill was £283,000 more in 1925
than in the previous year, and that a loss
of £242,322 was made in the 12 months.
An almost fanatical dread lest anybody in
its employ should work too fast has long
governed the Labor caucus which runs the
Sydney City Council, and lately the terror
has spread till it includes inanimate things.
Some time ago the council ordered 3000 bags
of cement, splitting the order among three
firms. One of the three orders is now to be
cancelled, and the reason is that while this
cement —a local product, by t!r -ay—con-
forms to all the chemical tests, u s faster
than the others. The joke is that it is. not
long ago since tire council’s technical advisers
were complaining about the slow setting of
locally-made cements and urging the importa-
tion of something that would set more
rapidly.
The A.W.U. in Queensland has resolved to
resume the issue of membership tickets to
Southern Europeans. This is a win for
Giovanni and Tomaso on the sugarfields, who
have been at bitter variance with local
A.W.U. labor for long past, and showed their
disapproval by helping to keep Theodore out
of the Herbert seat. The ostensible reason
for the A.W.U.’s change of heart is the pro-
posed formation of an Italian Workers’
Sugar Industry Union in North Queensland.
The Big Union deprecates this on the ground
that the new body might encourage commu-
nism. That it might also discourage the
A.AY.U. never occurred to it, of course.

*Exclusive of £BO,OOO issued for goodwill in
subsidiary cos. fThree months.
First steps have been taken towards recon-
struction, and, as is usually the case, the
directors are not being cheered over the whole
of the journey. Some pref. shareholders are
protesting; and this history of the co. and
its troubles may help to explain why:—
In 1922 the Lincoln Spinning Mills Prop., Ltd.,
and Lincoln Knitting Mills Prop., Ltd., went on to
the market for capital to relieve them of their heavy
burden of floating debt. At Dec. 31, 1921, this debt
aggregated £530,005 —bank overdraft, £187,287;
trade debts, £108,288; Gibbs, Bright and Co.
advance, £103,704; W. C. Gaunt advance, £122,022;
sundry creditors, £8704. (There was also £20,000
provision for taxation.) Lincoln Mills (Aust.), Ltd.,
was formed as a holding co.; it issued 402,632 fully-
paid £1 ordinaries for the two proprietaries, includ-
ing goodwill at £BO,OOO, and offered 400,000 9 p.c.
£1 cum. prefs. to the public. The visible deficit
of the introductory table represents the flotation costs.
At the time, prefs. were secured by tangible assets
of £722,000. As usual with holding cos., share-
holders have been given little information of value
us to the subsidiaries. The prospectus had spoken
“conservatively” and with “moderation” of profits of
£98,875 p.a. In the first three months £lB,OOO was
received in divs. front the holdings. Prefs. got their
div. and the deficit was reduced by £8713. Since
then the co. has received no further divs. from, the
subsidiaries, and its expenditme—salaries and direc-
tors’ fees and general office exes. —has accounted for
the losses shown. In their 1923 report the directors
were confident that the subsidiaries were “in an
excellent position to profit” from the already evident
return to more normal trading conditions. In 1924
the position was such that they had to tell share-
holders that the combined loss of the subsidiaries
for that year’s operations was £43,664. For the
12 mouths to June 30 last there was a recovery,
profits won b.y the two concerns being stated at
£15,341. But on July 20 the greater part of the
knitting mills was destroyed by fire. That was
the last straw.
In view of the big deficit at P. and L. on
June 30 and the then unpromising outlook,
action of some kind would have been neces-
sary, but the still further losses arising out
of the fire made reconstruction almost im-
perative. A financial statement to the end of
1925 has been prepared, and it is on the
information contained therein that share-
holders are asked to act.
The directors’ proposals have been placed
before shareholders. The suggestion is to
write down the ordinary shares from fl to
4s. each and cancel the accrued divs. on the
prefs. The writing down would allow of the
writing off of the P. and L. debit (£27,211
at June 30) ; writing off of the fire losses
(to be ascertained) ; writing off the goodwill
of the subsidiaries, £80,000; and writing
down plant and premises to present values.
Insurance paid to the co. totalled £382,596
and represented assets destroyed. If pref.
shareholders consent to forego their 31 years'
divs. to December 31, 1925, the co. will be
relieved of a contingent liability of £133,333.
Ordinary shareholders have agreed, but pref.
holders have yet to make their decision. They
are, of course, entitled to their divs.; the
whole question is what they get in re-
turn for the concession they make. The
chairman urges adoption because the scheme
would clean up the balance-sheets of the sub-
sidiaries and of the holding co., and free
them from debits and intangibles, and make
future profits available for distribution. That
is perfectly true, of course; but it doesn’t
get over the fact that the prefs. will loss
£133,000-odd of those profits if they are made.
In return the ordinaries are prepared to agree
that the prefs. shall have the right to par-
ticipate up to a further 3 p.c. in any surplus
available for div. in any year after paying
the 9 p.c. to the prefs. and £lO,OOO to the
ordinaries. As the ordinaries will be written
down to about £BO,OOO from £400,000 it means
that they will get only about 2\ p.c. on their
old capital before the prefs. are entitled to
participate. The co. will have to divide
£46,000 before the prefs. gets an extra bite;
and the right to this extra bite is to last
10 years. Over that period 3 p.c. p.a. means
£120,000 —approximately the amount the
prefs. are asked to forego. In effect, the
scheme says: “We can only pay you out of
future profits, anyhow. Here is a scheme
by which you can get them if they are earned
without squeezing out the ordinaries.” It
is a very fair plan; the first-announced
scheme, which did not mention the 3 p.c.
extra bite, was subject to criticism on that
account.
If the proposals are adopted the co. should,
on the figures given to shareholders, win pro-
fits sufficient to permit of divs. For the first
half of last financial year a loss was dis-
closed, but operations to June 30 were suc-
cessful to the extent that that loss was wiped
out, and a profit of £15,341 shown for the 12
months. At the end of June, too, orders “on
a profitable basis, totalling approximately
£200,000 were in hand.” With wool at the
extreme prices of a year ago, business of
wool manufacturers was very difficult, and
the co.’s gloomy experience is not surprising.
At the annual meeting shareholders were told
that the commencement of the new financial
year had been marked with distinct promise
—thanks very largely, no doubt, to the new
Customs tariff.

Quarries, Ltd., which paid £l5BOO in 10

Reserves are supposed to be accumulated
profits in excess of capital represented by
tangible assets; but in a case of this kind,
where the chief tangible assets are quarries
and their equipment, it is very hard to say
whether there are any reserves at all. Every-
thing depends on the valuation of the assets;
and only by a miracle could two men, work-
ing independently, arrive at the same valua-
tion of a group of quarries. Not much notice
need, therefore, be taken of the so-called
reserves of either a quarry or a mine; and
for the same reason true profits are not
easy to arrive at. During the year 33,850
ordinaries were taken up by shareholders at
par, the money being needed principally to
equip Prospect quarry. This carried the
capital to £183,850. The quarry and plant
item went from £177,614 to £207,745, and
book debts were £13,491 greater, together an
increase of £43,623. During the year also
£4650 was paid off the Minnamurra quarry
(£6975 remains) ; so the new capital being
insufficient to do all these jobs, the co. had
to go to its bankers for a further £6752. The
point which concerns investors chiefly is the
co.’s capacity to exploit the deposits profit-
ably. The basalt is of excellent quality, and
the supply “inexhaustible,” and the demand,
owing to the increasing use of concrete in
road-making and other constructional acti-
vities, has been growing fast. The co. bought
the Prospect, Minnamurra and Bombo quar-
ries from the NjS.W. Blue Metal 00. in
November, 1921, and has been spending big
sums in equipping its properties. While
results, providing adequate allowance has
been made for depreciation, have been satis-
factory, the full benefit of the expenditure
has not yet been felt. The new plant at
Prospect, for example, was only installed
during last year. The chief balance-sheet
movements have been :
1922. 1923. 1924. 1925.

The present activity in building and con-
struction shows no sign of easing, and the
politicians are talking of enormous concrete-
road schemes; but a couple of bad seasons
and a screwing down on loans would explode
much of that. And the co. hasn’t visibly
built up any strength to guarantee share-
holders a continuance of those 10 p.c. divs.
should demand fall off seriously.

That last line speaks eloquently of the diffi-
culties met during the year by M.L. freezing
cos. At no time in the 20 years of which
this Column has this co.’s record have profits
been relatively so low. Slightly less was
disclosed in 1913 and 1908, but more than
three times as much capital is at work these
days. Freezing and packing is an in-and-out
business at all times, for to the variability
of world demand inustt be added the influence
of the seasons locally. But this co. is
fortunately positioned ; it operates in one of
the few areas in the world where the con-
sistent production of highest-class mutton is
possible. And past efficiency in management
assures to shareholders a fair return, even
in lean times. True, the 6J p.c. looks
modest: but the 1919 capitalisation makes
it worjh 121 p.c. to old' holders. Despite
this capitalisation, visible reserves are still
of fair size, and that is liqlpful. Something
may be hidden, too. in the fixed assets. For
years the co. added extensively to plant out
of profits and then wro»te off with obvious
excess, ostensibly agjnnlst the depreciation
of older plant. Wlipn the watering took
place £50,000 was brought to light, and, even
if that emptied the stocking then, the co.
has probably whipped away whatever it could
of recent years, though there has been no
chance of doing anything heroic in that
respect.
The accounts are very taciturn, and this
comparison practically exhausts the informa-
tion :
19 tO. 1915. 1920. 1925.
Liabilities .. £81,620 £307,385 ( £635,346 £699,379
Fixed assets .. 297,723 273,522; 852,674 755,545
Other assets . . 99,891 542,587 534,233 726,201
Included in liabilities is “provision for de-
preciation of investments and contingencies,’’
but care is taken not to specify the amount.
The “other assets” are consignments,
investments and cash. In the last five years
the co., while maintaining its works and
paying its divs., has added £127,985 to these
liquids and semi-liquids, af|ter allowing for
the increase of liabilities; and probably some
of the extra £04,033 of liabilities are con-
tingency reserves. But evep assuming that
these contingency reserves are necessary to
cover depreciation and risks not otherwise
provided for, it seems that the co. has put
enough by, on the average, to pay another
4 p.c. p.a. It is very grateful and comfort-
ing.

The cool September half, never very flush,
gave poorer results than usual last year be-
cause the co.’.s employees came out on a
“sympathy” strike and tied up brewing for
four weeks. But much more significant is
the fact that aggregate profits over recent
years have been well beyond dividend require-
ments. Of course, a new Pussyfoot may
arise to rally the Dry Army; but that is a
possibility of which nobody is better aware
than the Trade, and being forewarned it is
doubtless also forearmed. That the market
thinks less of the risk than it does of the
great Australian thirst is made plain by the
popularity of Swan scrip—and of most others
in the same section.
The Swan is a Melbourne co.; Montague
Cohen, of the Carlton and United, is chair-
man. So that the Wcstralian might get as
good a drink as his comrade in Melbourne,
capital was increased two years ago to allow
the co. to make lager and bitter beer. Inci-
dentally, some of the hotel properties were
modernised. As shareholders were asked for
a premium of only ss. on each 255. share
issued, the 16 p.c. reads good to them. Yet,
considering the volume of visible reserves —
£323,528 at September 30 —the return isn’t
so glittering. On average visible funds over
the past twelve months shareholders got only
7.7 p.c. p.a. And probably there are con-
siderable reserves inside. Fixed assets, for
instance, have been written down with a
heavy hand: plant and machinery are in at
£269,388 less £150.516 written off; rolling-
stock and casks, £41,600 less £34,486; and
hotel properties and furniture, £427,382 less
£54,394. The hotel properties are, of course,
worth more than that —so long as they re-
main hotel properties. During the term
mortgages increased from £9046 to £53.681,
and the co. worked up an overdraft of £7413,
its cash balance of £28,698 disappearing. The
CO. went outside to the extent shown, chiefly
to finance its purchase of additional hotel
properties, that item increasing by £(10,140.
Trade debts were lighter (£10,846), and
“accounts in credit, including goodwills accru-
ing,” were at £47,211. The financial position
was comfortable: more or less licpiid assets
totalled £160,076.

France has been conquered; that is cable
information of the past few days. The com-
pletion of the long negotiations with the
society which controls Longchamps is the
biggest achievement since the formation of
the co. At present Longchamps operates
the inefficient and costly pari mutuel. Its
turnover under that system, with a limited
racing season, was 206,410,960 francs in
1923; 211,953,915 in 1924; 220,000,000 last
year. But the society also controls Chan-
tilly and Deauville, so that further business
should result. And there is this additional
promise in the position : a lead from racing
headquarters is generally followed. The im-
portant development in France lies beyond
the accounts. It has been slow work. Each
year, however, some progress has been re-
corded. Last year’s quota consisted of con-
tracts from Rangoon, Singapore and S. Aus.
Results also accrued from negotiations with
the Canadian racing authorities: a small
machine—“the first totalisator ever used in
Canada”-—has been installed at Colwood
Park, Victoria, B.C. Business is expected
to result from that “in the near future.”
Of lesser importance was the installation
of an indication-board and starting and tim-
ing device at the new Sydney motor speed-
way. These latter were the work of engineer
O. A. Julius, the inventor of this totalisator
and a director of the co. Sole rights have
been acquired, and, although of minor value,
should profitable in a small way.
The benefit of the installation of the two
machines at Bombay was not reflected in the
accounts ; they were used for the first time
on December 12. As that is the largest propo-
sition with the exception of Randwick, and
as the amount of business to be handled by
it is expected to exceed that of any other,
the present year should show considerable
improvement. Thus far overhead has been
heavy, but that should not be felt so much
now that more substantial results are being
won. _ Last year was burdened with more
than its fair share of expenses; sales, com-
mission, etc., totalled £80,063 compared with
£57.379, but net profit was only £2Ol greater,
although £479 more was set aside for depre-
ciation than in 1924. This table compares
balance-sheet movements back to the be-
ginning :

As the amount of goodwill is unspecified,
reserves are labelled “nominal.” The high
hopes of the prospectus that world rights
alone would more than pay for goodwill may
yet be realised. Each contract results in
improvement, but until the hot air is dis-
placed by interest-earning assets returns are
not likely to be considerable. The outlook,
however, is promising.
Apropos Julius’s invention, here is an
interesting note about another:—
While Lang and Co. have been at work trying to
make Australia’s upward struggle longer and more
difficult by means of 44-hour weeks, Leonard Naunton
and J. Eves, of Sydney, have been quietly engaged
on a method of counteracting their baleful influence.
The result is the super-multi-coin release. It is
an unpretentious-looking instrument that hides a deal
of cunning. For some years past Europe and America
have dined in “automatic caffe” and bought their
tickets at slot machines, but these were cumbersome
affairs of many mouths and difficult to handle. The
Australian invention, for which world rights have
been obtained, and for the purchase and working of
which a co. with a capital of £75,000 is shortly to
go upon the market, is unique in having but a
single slot, with the, uncanny faculty of being able
to discriminate between any sum of money from a
halfpenny to 3s. llid. If it is set at the latter
figure it will refuse to deliver up its goods until
the full amount in various coins is inserted, and
if too much is offered it will refund the change.

Wizard Lighting Systems have proved a wonderful
boon to the country folk. The economy and efficiency
of this service is unique, bringing the conveniences
of a great city to the most isolated districts. The
soft, yet brilliant, illumination has the soothing-

Lincoln Mills.— -Negotiations for the re-
construction of this co. are making better
progress. At first it was proposed that the
ordinaries should be written down to 55., and
that the prefs. should forego £133,000-odd of
accumulated divs. As the proposals were
threshed out this was modified; the ordi-
naries, it is now proposed, shall be reduced
to 45., and the prefs., while foregoing the
accumulations, shall be entitled for 10 years
to an extra 3 p.c. out of the profits of any
year after the ordinaries have had £lO,OOO.
As the latter is equal to less than p.c.
on the old ordinary capital, the scheme —
though a compromise, of course—is reason-
ably generous to the prefs.
* * * *
Coogee Ocean Pier Co., Ltd., has issued
a revised prospectus. Capital of £250,000
is divided: £75,000 in £1 10 p.c. cum.
partic. prefs.; £125,000 in ordinaries;
£21,000 in fully-paid ords. to vendors; and
£29,000 in shares in reserve. Vendors also
receive £4OOO in cash. The minimum sub-
scription for flotation is already assured.
The co. is to take over from Australian Piers,
Ltd., its rights to erect a promenade pier
in Coogec Bay, which will carry theatre,
ballroom and concert-hall, restaurant, etc.
The “Wild Cat” reviewed the proposition
when it was first advanced, questioning the
ability of the structure to w-eather the storms
to which it would be exposed. The present
prospectus contains more complete informa-
tion on that point. There are still, however,
some points for the investors’ consideration.
In particular will the estimated proportion
of visitors to Coogee prefer the promenade
to the sands, the latter being free? And is
the estimated outlay for maintenance suffi-
cient? Upon the former point, at any rate,
one man’s guess is probably as good as an-
other’s. But if the surplus revenue available
comes within 50 p.c. of the estimate there will
be over 10 p.c. divs. in it.
* * # *
Joe Millican, Fred G. Brown, Fred Oertel
and others have registered a N.L. co. in Syd-
ney called N. Q. Rare Metals. The capital
is £60,000 in 160,000 7s 6d. shares, of which
60,000 are vendors, 80,000 contribs. are paid
to 25., and 20,000 held in reserve. Vendors
also get £6OOO in cash payable £2OOO within
21 days of registration, and the balance
at the rate of £5OO per month. The ex-
ceptional prices ruling for wolfram, molyb-
denite and bismuth have emboldened the ven-
ture, which proposes to acquire a number of
leases at Wolfram Camp. Having been a
success, the flotation means that the Camp
will be opened up again at the various levels
from 180 ft. to 502 ft., where work was pre-
viously discontinued in the post-war metal
slump. Molybdenite is marketable at £2OO
to £220 a ton, according to grade, and wol-
fram fetches £BO to £9O. Outside Australia
the most important producers of these metals
are. China and Burma, and the unrest in
China has seriously interfered with produc-
tion. If Wolfram Camp hums again, the
total production is already bespoken by Louis
Burkhard and Co., Continental ore-buvers.

The Federal Government has at last de-
cided to make a geological survey of a likely
oil area. Keith Ward, Director of Mines of
S.A., and Wm. Baragwanath, Director of
Geology of Vic., are to report on the s.-e.
district,of S.A. just across the Victorian
border. In making this decision the Govern-
ment anticipated the passing of the
Petroleum Prospecting Act, under which
£60,000 is appropriated to make advances to
persons or companies engaged in the search
for oil; and to assist persons, cos. and State
Governments to make detailed geological
surveys. After this report has been made,
a staff of geological surveyors will be
appointed to carry out the work, which will
occupy a year. Ward and Baragwanath, it
is understood, will make a start near Nara-
coorte (S.A.), and then go down to
Caroline-Nelson and Munbunnar district,
s.-e. of Mount Gambier. After 17 years of
unsystematic stabbing, generally without
geological plans and on the advice mostly
of foreign oil men, it is gratifying to know
that correct procedure is being followed of
mapping the area.

. At the present price of tin, dredging is
tipped to revive in the Stanthorpe (Q.) dis-
trict during the current year. Several options
over freeholds are now being investigated.
It is reported that the Glen Aplin Co. has
completed boring, and that resuits obtained
make dredging imminent. Which, if correct,
will be the usual several months after the
date stated in the prospectus.

Geologist Ball’s report on Finney’s Hill
mine, at Iridooroopiliy (Q.). was i.oc unadul-
terated joy to shareholders. He admits that
there is little to guide the co. in the search
for ore, but deprecates haphazard driving ail
the same. He likes the combination of
breccia, felsite and Assuring, the first being
essential.,, The assay plans alone show the
constriction of the shallow breccia shoots as
the lower levels are reached. The idea sjiould
therefore be to look for breccia, and with
this object in view he points out three areas
where the c 6. has slender chances of chang-
ing its fortunes. The greatest promise is
along the felsite dyke in Cox’s shaft, but
there is also breccia exposed near the Cor-
poration quarry, and the promise of it to the
south-east of the main shaft. His report
brings out the patchy nature of ore distri-
bution and the absence of any defi led mm .r ;i
lode to which the search could be restricted.
It’s an expensive business continually driv-
ing through country to locate ore.
* * # *
Stanhills (N.Q.), the new tinfield of the
North, is under a cloud at present. The
erection of the battery and dam is being
pushed on, and the first crushings from the
Mauretania, Comet, etc., can be expected in
April. McLelland, the pioneer of the re-
vival, will certainly see that there is good
feed to begin with, but the test will be the
run of ore oyer the rest of the year. Reports
regarding the Mauretania have been varied
and conflicting.. Some placed it last year as
the best prospective tin-mine in- the North.
This was before the Great Northern at Her-
berton strutted on the stage with its dividend-
winning shoot. The latest geological reports
on Stanhills are not likely to cause a Stam-
pede to the remote North, and prospectors
will wait to see the Mauretania crushings.

The old State colliery, named after Dave
Bowman, on the Styx field (C.Q.), breathed
its last at Christmas. All Rockhampton
knew the excellent quality of its coal, but few
knew the difficulty of mining, and reference
to the Auditor-General’s reports was neces-
sary to find out the cost di it. The strata
in this mine,-where the first bid was success-
fully made to Operate; the Styx field, was
frightfully tumbled about, and Jack Phillips,
now retired to the Maitland field or there-
abouts, did yeoman service in following the
seam through all sorts of tnazes underground.
The logical successor to the Bowman colliery
is the Hartley colliery, named after Harold,
M.L.A. of that ilk, who represents a Rock-
hampton constituency.

The dwindling proclivities of Australian
gold-mining are illustrated by the case of
Queensland. In 1900 the State produced
951,6050 z., and would have topped the mil-
lion but for a severe water famine in the
last quarter. Mt. Morgan in that year
produced 106.2120 z. from 121,465 tons. In
1925 the best the State could do was
44,3320 z., against 95,7030 z. for 1924* the
shrinkage being mainly due to the total in-
terruption at Mt. Morgan. But unless some
quite unexpected finds are made, the big
State can hardly hope to pass 100,000 oz. even
under favorable conditions.

Belimbla Creek, Nerrigundah (N.S.W.),
appears to have gone the way of all latter-
day gold cos. in the Ma State. The £9OOO
put up by the 90,000 2s contribs. has been
absorbed in battery-construction and tunnel-
ling towards the Great Gold Lode of the over-
optimistic Joseph Campbell. Instead of the
“stream of gold” that was to run from the
battery-plates in January last year, there is
a depressing silence. Chairman Chas.
Napier was at one stage hopeful that the big
holders would find another £2OOO with which
to continue tunnelling, but apparently they
decided that it would be throwing good
money away. The position emphasises the
folly of rushing batteries up before the pro-
vender to feed them is in sight, or all doubts
of its accessibility dissipated.
Mt. Patterson, Attunga (N.S.W.), has
dilly-dallied so long over removal and erec-
tion of the old 20-liead battery from Mt.
Dudley that finances have dried up. The
office is calling shareholders together to dis-
cuss the position.

Two old goldfields are being prospected
over again at Foster in Gippslnnd and Snake
Valley, near Smythesdale (Vic.). At Tur-
ton’s Creek, near Foster, in the early dig-
gings days, 22-carat gold was won from the
alluvial, and osmiridium has been found in
recent years. At Snake Valley a deep lend
has been found by boring 100 ft. below the
surface and tested over 400 ft. in width, with
sft. of wash. Gold wis to -nenrly all
the bores, some yielding coarse colors. There
arc said to be five quartz lodes running
through the lease. This district was notable
long ago for its shallow gutters all more or
less gold-carrying.
* * * *
The itch for gold has worked on some bold
people who are re-opening ihe Great South-
ern Garden Gully mine, at the extremity
of the Garden Gully line, at Bendigo. They
have got rid of the water —apparently work
is to be resumed at Nos. 8,1 U and 12 levels,
where stone worth 13 and 14 dwt. was raised
in the old days.

The pontoon for the Shotover Co.’s dredge,
which is to operate on the. Shotover River,
Otago (M.L.), was launched recently, and
the work of assembling the machinery is
well advanced. 11. L. Herbert, engineer in
charge, hopes to get a run out of the dredge
before winter.
Selayang, near Kuala Lumpur (F.M.S.),
states that its dredge is due to arrive in
Malaya in February, and the London office
believes that the end of the year should see
tin-production. In the ordinary course,
though, a substantial extension of the
scheduled time may be looked for. J. M.
Newman, one of the Sydney directors, reports
that further areas have been acquired, and
good progress made in prospecting them.
Further areas are in view, and will be
acquired as wanted.

“Sepik” puts in' a word for Papua:—
That the Federal appropriation of £60,000 to
subsidise the search for oil does not apply to New
Guinea calls for protest. The Prime Minister’s con-
tention that very large sums had been spent in the
past in Papua without success begs the question.
If we consider the total spent in Australia on abortive
oil-shale ventures and petroleum prospecting gene-
rally, the New Guinea figure is swamped completely.
Also it must be remembered that oil is known to be
present in New Guinea, itself the biggest argument
in favor of assistance. In addition, the adverse
conditions operating against oil-seekers both in
Papua and the Mandated Territory surely warrant
Government recognition and assistance. The search
for oil in virgin tropical countries carries with it
countless risks not met with elsewhere, and the
transport of equipment involves heavy freight and
handling charges. Again, the construction of trans-
portation systems through tropical jungles and swamps
is often necessary, and technical and mechanical
experts have to be obtained in Australia or elsewhere,
and natives trained in novel tasks; As an offset,
actual drilling costs are cheaper than on the main-
land, but, taking it all round, the Australian oil
cos. operating there are just as much entitled to the
subsidy as those operating in Australia.

Drilling was to have fieen resumed this
week by the Ormildah Oil Development Co.,

of casing caused the hold-up. Field-manager
A. E. Crawford took advantage of the delay

The Australasian Institute of Mining and
Metallurgy states its opinion:—
Reports of mining cos. appear in the press from
time to time containing statements which, in the
absence of adequate explanation, are likely to prove
misleading to the public. The Council of the
A.I.M.M. considers that responsibility devolves upon
directors of cos. to ensure that reports are not mis-
leading to the general public.
A member of the institute gives an illus-
tration :
Comparisons of gross values of base-metal ore
bodies with the gross value of gold ore bodies should
make clear that working and realisation eo&ts are
much greater in the former than with gold. For
instance, for the 12 months ended June 30, 1925, a
Broken Hill co. treated 421,980 tons of crude ore
having a gross metal value of £lO 4s. per ton, and
made a net profit of £1 17s. per ton, which is
18 p.c. of the gross value. Given ore of equal value
(say, 2.40 z. of gold per ton), and taking all-in costs
at 335. 6d. per ton. the net profit in the case of, say,
one of the big Kalgoorlie mines, would be £8 10s.
6d. per ton —equal to 83 p.c. of the gross metal
value.
Still, only the very inexperienced investor
would be misled by a statement as to gross
value without an accompanying report on
treatment costs.
* * * *
The world’s lead-production for 1925
worked out at about 1.600,000 tons, or 27
p.c. above the 1913 figure. North America
now produces about 55 p.c. The war stimu-
lated production in more remote countries.
Before the war 95 p.c. of the lead in use
came from highly-civilised States, the low
prices forbidding transport from regions diffi-
cult of access. The Burma Corporation, for
instance, took 20 years to reach the dividend
stage in 1925. Labor troubles there are
numerous, the Burmese barring work in the
wet season, and only about 30 p.c. of those
on the paysheet are year-round
From rich mines easily worked the co. is
producing 1000 tons of ore a day. The open-
ing of other properties in Burma and across
the border in China is spoken of. Burma
Corp. earned £953,400 net for the year to
June 30, or £307,000 above the 1924 figure.
With £765,747 brought forward, the direc-
tors had an available balance of £1,719,165.
Balance after dividend payments was to be
used to retire the outstanding debentures
on January 1 of this year. Ore reserves at
the balancing date were written at 4,370,073
tons, of an assay value of 22.20 z. silver,
24.9 p.c. lead and 16.4 p.c. zinc. Ore re-
serves decreased 129,793 tons for the year,
but extraction for the period was 289,006
tons. The mine should have at least 15
years’ life on these figures.

“Old Logroller” : Frantic hunts for miss-
ing M’s.P. are not so rare as the public
might think. I recall another. The adven-
ture started in an early-morning meet-
ing with tw T o reprobate Labor members at
a time when the party possessed a majority
of only one in the N. S. Wales Parliament.
Each of them thought fit to allay my sur-
prise at seeing them drinking “soft stuff”
by whispering that he had had laid upon
him the responsibility of seeing that the
other was in the House; but they soon for-
DISCOURAGING.
“ Er-er didn’t I speak to you on the Bondi tram last night?”
“Oh, were [?] the person who said ‘Fares, please'.?”
got about that and the festivities really
commenced after * a meeting with Burgess,
M.L.A., who celt bating a good racing win,
.insisted on cracki a couple of magnums.
The Labor Govern. ™ nt . wnke j'.° lts danger
before the Wade C discovered its
opportunity, and .T. j Mercer, M.L.A., who
was put up to hold th * *>rt, went on prosily
repeating himself whils be Sydney
were scoured for the - ’delinquents. Jimmy
McNeil was found early; but Jack Cochrane,
when he was ultimately run to earth in the
old Tivoli upper bar, refused to return to
duty until a bottle of whisky was bought
as provision for the exile. W. P. Crick was
regarded as behind the temporary absence
of another M.L.A., who had announced his
intention of making trouble over a bill Crick
was fathering. In this instance the chase
was conducted by opponents of the bill
outside Parliament, but it was as frantic as
it was unavailing. Lured into a celebration, the
legislator had awakened after the spree to find
himself in a house of a very certain reputa-
tion, and without, a stitch of clothing. Un-
able to get out in his nakedness, and not
daring to summon outside help which would
have advertised his presence in that house, he
filled the establishment with frenzied de-
mands for his pants what time the measure
he wanted to oppose was pushed through all
its stages in Parliament, practically without
opposition.

“Clement It. d’Uppe”: I watched a gang
loading crates of rabbits the other day on
the -wharf at Newcastle (N.S.W.). The
hold was some distance from the shed, and
the gang started off with hand-barrows.
Not only was the method exasperatingly
slow, but owing to the uneven surface of
the wharf and the frequent necessity for
dodging mooring-lines (the mooring-posts are
in the middle of the wharves at Newcastle)
the loads kept tumbling off the barrow r s. In
desperation the boss of the gang dug out a
big four-wheeled affair, hitched a horse to
the load and speeded up things considerably,
beside giving the wharfies time for a spell
while the wheeled vehicle was in action.
Suddenly a union official arrived on the
scene and promptly declared the horse black,
presumably because it was not in the union,
whereupon operations ceased. After about
half an hour’s wrangling the gang resumed
and finished the job by pushing the truck
down the wharf themselves while the old
horse stood by, meditating, no doubt.

“M.G.”: He was chewing a cigarette-butt
in the bar, a skinny little rat who had just
won a very minor boxing competition, and
was celebrating the event with a small
shandy. An old pug. took in the picture and
grinned. “You’ll have to cut out the grape-
juice now, Les,” he admonished with heavy
sarcasm. Les gazed pensively at his reflec-
tion in the mirror opposite. “Yairs,” he con-
ceded, “it kicked John L. Sullivan and Peter
Jackson over all right. A man orter.”
“Centurion”: The
good old war-time
myths are being
stonkered, one after
another. The
corpse-factory yarn
has been exploded,
and now doubts are
being cast on the
authenticity of the
Kaiser’s army order
of August 19, 1914,
calling on his
troops to walk over
French’s “con-
temptible little
army.” Though
this is quoted in
British Army
orders of Septem-
ber 24, 1914, no
trace of it can be
found in the Ger-
man records. Bill
himself denies hav-
ing issued any such
order, and since he
did not go to Aix-
la-Chapelle, whence
the order was sup-
posed to have ema :
nated, until long
after its alleged
date, it looks quite
possible that he is
telling the: truth-.
The impression
grows that British
G.H.Q., feeling
that the retiring
troops could , do!
with a spiritual
bracer, invented the
ingenious sneer. If
so, its far-reaching
effects must have
astonished the ori-
ginators.
“Cuchulain”: Rain became worth £25 a
point on the racecourse at Tenterfield
(N.S.W.) the other day, and this was the
way of it. The Tenterfield Jockey Club in-
sured the meeting against . rain for a pre-
mium of £2 10s. on a. policy of £5O, payable
if 20 points of rain or more should fall be-
tween 8 a.m. on the opening day and 1 p.m.
on the second. All went well the first day;
but a “spit” set in at noon on the second.
The postmaster’s representative glued his
attention to the rain-gauge while the club
officials kept theirs on their watches. At
1 p.m. only IS points had fallen. The club
had lost £5O by two points!

“Ex-Dig.” : A recent cable dealing with the
alleged causes of the mutiny among German
sailors at Kiel in 1917 mentions that this
was known as “turnip year” in Germany.
THE DEVIL HE KNEW.
PEGGY: “They tell me Phil married his former wife's sister.”
FLO: “Yes, Phil always was lazy. He didn’t like the idea of having to break in another
mother-in-law.”
The A.I.F. can remember the turnips. Hans
and Fritz were given seed to sow, even
amongst the wire entanglements in front of
their trenches; and when the enemy was
pushed back off the Messines area turnips
were everywhere. They were good eating,
too. when boiled with potatoes and a tin of
bully-beef. We paid Hans back, in a way.
Towards the spring of 1918 the British fol-
lowed the German example ; to counteract
the vegetable shortage, seeds were provided,
and orders issued that they should be planted
wherever soldiers were located, except in the
line itself. Ploughs and other implements
were dug oiit, and the excursion into agricul-
ture was regarded as rather good fun. But
it was the Hun who reaped many of the fruits
of our labor when he began his spring offen-
sive of 1918 and rushed over the areas we
had planted.

“Fishplate”: The record for speed estab-
lished on an Australian railway has not been
disturbed since the death of N.S.W. Gover-
nor Duff in 1895. His Ex. was desperately
ill; and his daughters, who., were at_ Sutton
Forest, were summoned to his bedside. A
special train, with a couple of extra carriages
to put a little weight behind the rushing
engine, was whirled out to pick up its pas-
sengers and race back again at 671 miles per
hour. The Governor, however, died before
his daughters’ arrival. The guard of that

“A.8.W.”: Sylvia was requested by postr

“Oxmead”: Is there anything that looks
so amazingly grotesque as a statue- under-
going repair? Some three, years ago I saw
a wdrkman tinkering with the equestrian
presentment of Edward VII. Hear the Syd-
ney Conservatorium. Apparently the monarch
had got a bit out of plumb, Or some frac-
tional shifting was deemed necessary.; any-
way, the bpwyanged adjuster had - takeii tho
horseman in halves and was 'pfitting him
together •to his own satisfaction. Even a
king severed at the waist-line, with the upper
half canted back at right , angles, is bound
to lack dignity, and in the case of such a
stickler for ceremony as the departed Ed.
VII. the violence —it took a tremendous
wrench—looked something very like an out-
rage. Fortunately it was pretty early in
the morning and the occasional pedestrians
evidently didn’t suspect the honest mechanic
of being a Bolshevik in disguise manifesting
his hostility towards kings. They _ merely
shot curious glances at him, what time the
straightener of royalty whistled as blithely
and unconcernedly over his work as if a
sovereign in bronze was no more to him than
the figure in a draper’s show-window.
“Glen A.”: One of the new M’s.L.C. in
N. S. Wales was not long in getting into hot
water. A night or so after liis elevation he
sat down at a table in the Parliamentary
dining-room occupied by a couple of knightly
legislators who greeted him courteously. It
was his party that objected. “Wotclier mean
by hobnobbing with the heads?” he was asked
to explain. Officially he could find no ex-
cuse, but privately he remarked, lingering his
gold pass: “If they think I'm going to eat
out of a trough they can have the damn thing
back.”
“H. Horsecollar”: Amundsen, the South
Pole-finder, woke the echo of an old story
lately by telling an audience that the claim
of the discredited Dr. Cook to the discovery
of the North Pole was quite as good as that
of the applauded and accredited Peary, who
was made an Admiral for his alleged find.
Explorer Greeley (Major-General Adolphus
Washington G., aged 82) went one better
by declaring that neither Cook nor Peary
cVer got there, and that the North Pole is
still waiting. Over 15 years ago The Bul-
letin held the view that there were over-
large discrepancies in the Peary narrative,
and in addition took a sporting chance on
Cook as “The Jew Who Found the Pole,” or
words to that effect. The Cook and Peary
stories both rested on the explorers’ say-so,
and at first the glassy stare of incredulity
was apparently as ready for one as for the
other. But Peary was a U.S. naval officer
and a domestic pet. It was his eighth ex-
pedition-when he uttered his roar of victory,
and lie was getting too old for further en-
deavors. To take him at face value looked
like a final chance to hitch the name of G.
Washington’s country to one really big dis-
covery. So Roosevelt, just emerged from a
long spell as President and about to start
for Africa and strew the landscape with big
game, took up Peary with a l’oar of applause
before the voice of doubt could express itself,
and the matter was settled. Cook never cast
reflections on Peary, but Peary’s pursuit of
Cook as an impostor continued till that
luckless individual, not being an admiral
with an ex-President behind him, hadn’t a
shred of reputation left. In the end he took
to promoting dubious oil companies, and is
now, or was lately, doing 15 years for using
the U.S. mails to push the business. In
Australia the Post Office is availed of in
casual fashion by any kind of company
swindler; but Uncle Sam gets his dander up
in unexpected ways and places. A lynching
may leave him cold, while a modest attemnt
to separate him from his dollars may make
him: shout to have the miscreant put in a
dungeon for centuries.

THE PRACTICAL PENITENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When all that is to do is done,
And every song at last is sung;
When, swift or slow, the race is run,
And craven old are the valiant young ;
When conscience takes to tip his spears
The poison of penance —well I wist
This most I’ll rue, despite nty fears,
The sweet-mouthed maid I might have kissed,
And missed.
When paled the blaze of appetite,
When lusty passion’s sun has set,
When life is lived awaiting night
Throughout a dusk of grey regret,
Oh, many a sin will send its ghost
To haunt a soul in terror shrunk ;
And still I know I’ll mourn the most
That beer (just begging to be drunk)
Un-sunlc.
Since little hope I have or had
Of never faltering on the path,
Since life, must have, however glad,
This penitential aftermath,
I would not add unto the woe
That waits, a burden far from light;
And so. . . . I’ll drink that beer ; and so. ...
I’ll kiss that blessed girl at sight,
To-night!
QUEENSLAND.

“R.M.” : There are a good many men who
have a habit of keeping a bank-note of sub-
stantial value somewhere about their clothes
—“just in cage of accidents” —but there are
not many as thorough about it as Ronald
Mackay, of Gunyerwarildi, a genial soul who
has hosts of friends up in the N. S. Wales
nor’-west. His habit of carrying a fiver is
as well known as his readiness to lend it.
The morning after the night after the Inver-
ell picnic races Mackay, who had sought his
bed at a decent hour, came forth in pyjamas
and a bath-towel to find roysterers still argu-
ing and wagering on the pub verandah.
“Lend me a fiver, Ronald,” implored one of
the sports. Sure enough, Mackay produced
it then and there —from the pocket of his
pyjama-coat!

dent of Surry Hills. A young John Hop
tackled two men who were in the act of
“fanning” a drunk. After handcuffing one
to a convenient post, he set out in pursuit
of the other. But the second man was a
hefty thug, and put up such a fight that, be-
fore reinforcements arrived, the copper had
become a hospital case, Badly dazed through
concussion, he was unable to indicate the
whereabouts of the man he had handcuffed.
It was not until next morning that the police

SECOND DITTO: “Yes, I’ve tried them all.”
“Fcng-Shui”: Have you ever been upset,
when you have left your season-ticket at
home, at being compelled to pay “excess”?
Well, for your comfort, listen to this. “The
head of Ma Shan, a Chinese, which was ex-
hibited at the Shanghai North Station for
two days, was on Thursday sent back to
Nanking. He was executed at Pukow for
pretending to be a soldier and travelling on
trains without paying his fare.” The item
is dated Nov. 28, 1925.

"Jesmond”: Re the strange places where
the strike-bug is liable to crop up (B.
7/l/’26). Recently the marine superinten-
dent of one company gave three cadets —they
used to be plain apprentices—the chance of
a 12 months’ trip on one of
the newest ships. They
jumped at the chance, but
they had a list of “rights”
to present to the skipper and
superintendent when they
joined up in Sydney. An
well as enumerating the
duties they were prepared to
carry out and the orders
they would obey, the log de-
manded the following privi-
leges: The right to mix with
first-class passengers, the
free run of the ship and
meals in the first saloon.
Fortunately for the service
and the boys themselves, all
they got was a tongue-
thrashing—and their passage
back to Melbourne.

ernors are often criticised for

sum. He found somebody to
voice a protest, and the
Crown Law Department re-
mitted the penalty by plac-
ing the £2 on the estimates.
The Brunswicker got the
notion that the Ex. of the
period had paid the fine out
of his own pocket; and it
was a genuinely grateful
parent who prompted his
daughter, a seventh-class
pupil at the local State
School, to pen a letter of thanks to the
Sovereign’s representative. It is sad to re-
cord that the precious page, torn from the
girl’s exercise-book, never met the gaze of
vice-royalty: it didn’t get past the private
sec.’s “miscellaneous” box.

“Wang”: Hughie Cusack of Barrow
Creek, earned a precarious livelihood by
doing carting jobs with a bony nag and
dilapidated vehicle between the railway-
station and the township. A new John Hop
was appointed to Barrow Creek, and one
of his first official acts was to inform Hughie
that he must get his name and address
painted on his deplorable turn-out. A day or
two later the local carrier called the John
Hop over to see that his instructions had
been carried out. Scrawled in bright red
paint on the side of the vehicle was “U E Q”
and a facsimile of a sixpence ; underneath was
the badly-drawn picture of a barrow. The
Law eyed the decorations dubiously. “Me
name and address,” explained Hughie. “See
—Hugh E Q zac, an’ barrow.” The cop
frowned at first, then grinned. “You’ve for-
gotten to put in the Oreek !” he objected. “Oh,
no. I ain’t.” replied the humorist. “Wait
till I start her off an’ you’ll hear that.”

“Beta”: Speaking of two sorts of nuts
(B. 21/l/’26), one of Queensland’s early
tariffs imposed a duty on several of the edible
variety, finishing with “All other nuts.” A
punctilious ■Customs officer at an outport tried
to collect duty on a consignment of bolt-
nuts under this heading. The consignee
hotly objected, and the matter was referred
to headquarters. The departmental chief
must have been in a cheerful mood that
morning, for the Customs officer promptly re-
ceived an official notification that - all nuts
which he could not crack with his teeth must
be admitted duty free.

“Hamer”: Sydney’s “resting-place by the
sea,” the cemetery at Waverley, is getting
the “House full” sign painted: no more allot-
ments are available. A search has been
made amongst the records to find graves that
have not been claimed by those who origin-
ally bespoke them, and some 30 of these have
been located; but they are only for the
wealthy, prices ranging from £2O to £75.
Permission is sometimes given to re-open
an old grave for a second burial, but the
funeral cortege winding its way to Waverley,
once to be seen many times daily, is already
a rare sight. Amongst its other slumberers
the cemetery holds the remains of a generous-
hearted pressman who yvs responsible for
one of the queerest “shouts” on record. One
day, when he was flush, both vinously and
financially, he insisted on buying grave lots
for all his cobbers. When his gifts were
refused he found himself with his purchases
upon his hands. It might have been thought
that he would have kept one for his own
use; but when he died the pen-brothers who
raised a subscription for his funeral found
that he hadn’t. He had exhausted the whole
stock on those who had preceded him to
Waverley.

“O.P.II.”: The efforts of the Vic. Fur-
nishing Trades Union to prevent unfair com-
petition by Chinese workers recalls an inci-
dent of the late ’nineties when Peacock,
Minister for Labor, was trying to counter-
act a more serious state of things. The
Chinks denied then, as they do now, that
they were working longer hours and accept-
ing lower pay than whites. To protest
against special restrictions they sent a depu-
tation of between 80 and 100 to Peacock.
Affecting not to be able to speak or under-
stand English, the deputation hired an inter-
preter, and he certainly earned his fee. “Do
you seriously claim that you are paid the
minimum wage, and that you only work the
maximum number of hours?” the Minister
asked. After a parley with the deputation
the interpreter said “Yes.” “In face of these
reports?” queried Peacock (holding up a
sheaf of documents from inspectors). “Yes,”
was the stolid answer. “Then you’re a pack
of damned liars,” said Peacock. There was
a roar of laughter from the deputation. “Ah,”
chuckled Peacock —“I see if you don’t un-
derstand English you’ve got a pretty good
knowledge of Australian.”
“Schnorrer”: An Englishman who has
just read his will into a gramophone-record-
ing machine, so that his relatives may hear
his own voice expressing his testamentary
wishes, is not the first in that field. Rabbi
Emil Hirsch, of Chicago, who died in 1923,
preached his own funeral oration per gramo-
phone-record prepared beforehand. Hirsch
was one of the most pronounced of the “Re-
form” Jews, who even went to the length of
denying the immortality of the soul; and his
gramophone address appeared like a last bril-
liant effort to shock the Chosen.
“Nikko”: The cheapest sanatorium I ever
saw, occupied by a solitary patient, was at
Te Ngawha Springs, in North Auckland.
Riding through the scrub to the steaming
ponds one morning we were hailed by a man
from the hills above, and down from a small
hut limped a young bushman. who had lived
for eight months alone in the solitude. A
severe drenching had crippled him with rheu-
niatisiri, and as lie could not afford expensive
treatment he took possession of the deserted
hut in the wilds and bathed daily in the
springs. He had a choice of baths —boiling,
hot, tepid and cold—and a large warm lake
in which to swim. Maoris brought him food
and papers from the next township, and after
some months he was slowly recovering the
use of his limbs. An occasional visitor looked
him up, and he was not discontented in his
isolation.

And poignant feeling for the loss
Of lowly Moreton-in-the-Marsh
And lofty Stratton-'on-the-Fosse.

A word of greeting fain I’d toss
From Wyndham-on-the-Werribee.

Although he was in the N. S. Wales Par-
liament for three years Dr. Robert Stopford,'
who died in Sydney last week, was no poli-
tician. Politics to him were only of signifi-
cance in so far as they might be made to
affect the conditions under which children are
born and reared. It was his devotion to
reform in such matters that made the Labor
party’s programme attractive to him when
he came to Sydney from Maoriland 14 years
ago, bringing with him the ideals of the child
welfare movement started by Lady Plunket.
He claimed to have helped to bring 30,000
children into the world since his arrival in
Sydney, and he did a lot for the youngsters
after they were born. He was,63 at the
end of a more than ordinarily useful life.
It doesn’t improve an Irishman’s respect
for the law and constituted authority to
christen him “Robert Emmet.” O’Halloran,
M.L.A., secretary of the N. S. Wales Labor
party, was thus treated by his parents, and
he nearly got himself ejected from the gal-
lery of the Leg. Council Chamber the other
day for emitting a loud hooray when the
result of the division on the first reading of the
Abolition Bill was declared. The oldest in-
habitant of the House can’t remember such
a dreadful thing happening there before.
•T. B. Suttor, the N.S.W. Leg. Councillor
whose doubtful attitude on the Abolition
Bill caused Premier Lang uneasiness, serves
as a living link with the Ma State's legis-
W. O. ARCHIBALD, ex-Federal Minister,
now, at 76, living in a Salvation Army
home in Adelaide.
lative past. Except for one short break, fol-
lowing the death of Francis Suttor in 1915,
a representative of the clan has sat in one
or other branch of the N.S.W. Parliament
ever since the State got responsible govern-
ment. Incidentally, Brewardine, the old
home of the Suttors at Bathurst, was the
venue of the only N.S.W. Executive Council
meeting ever held out of Sydney. That was
in Governor Loftus’s time.
One of those queer coincidences which
make even Conan Doyle’s fairy photographs
seem less rococo happened to H. E. D’Estre,
a Melbourne furniture-dealer, when he made
a bid in a city auction-room the other day
and had some dusty old pictures, supposed
to be lithos, knocked down to him. One of
them, on being cleaned, turned out to be
a portrait of his mother, hand-painted and
signed by Amy Bouvier, in Switzerland, in
1867, six years before he was born.
Harry Allan, who will succeed Peverill as
Vic. Under-Sec. of Lands in April, is one
of the best-known officers of the State ser-
vice. It was once the fashion to identify
him as the brother of Frank, “the bowler
of a century,” but time brings its revenges,
and before Frank died he was “Harry's
brother,” Before the war Harry Allan did
notable work as an immigration officer. Toil-
ing day and night with only a small staff to
help him, he nearly shattered his health.
Twenty-three years ago he displayed fine
courage in standing up for civil servants
against the massed Kyabramapootra- cum -
Irvine attack. As he is well on in the sixties
he will not have a long reign—a year or so—
but he can look forward to a pension of £6
a week secured to him as a “twilighter”
under the Superannuation Act passed three
months ago.
J. G. Shield, who has gone west at 73, was
the first in Tasmania to receive the certi-
ficate granted by the Federal Executive of
the Returned Sol-
diers’ League for
services rendered to
soldiers and their
dependants; only
31 of them were
distributed all o-
gether. For over
30 years Shield was
Inspector of Public
Buildings, had been
Mayor of Hobart
and Master War-
den, and was one
of the first export-
ers of Tasmanian
fruit to England—
this from his
orchard at Huon.
Dr. NOTT, M.H.R.,
who eliminated
Cx-Premier Theo-
dore in the con-
text for the Her-
bert (Q.) seat.
Died recently at Auckland, Miss Isa Outli-
waite, the last of a well-known old M.L.
family which amassed much property in the
early days of the city. With the exception
of the home site, the property is willed to
the R.C. Bishop of Auckland for educational
purposes, while Taranga Island, the largest
of the Hen and Chickens group off the coast
of North Auckland, is left to the King, to
be used as a bird sanctuary. For this pur-
pose the island is ideal; it is a rugged speck,
already containing numbers of rare birds,
some of which have escaped from the Govern-
ment sanctuary near by, the Little Barrier.
Plants unknown on the mainland also grow
on Taranga, and the rare tuatara lizard
and the mutton-bird keep house together.
The Page family has deep roots in Grafton
(N.S.W.). The original of the family settled
in the district in 1858 as master of the first,
national school established there. The eldest
son, Thomas, who has just died, was 14 when
the family arrived, and two years later was
helping his father with the school. Later he
ran a booksellers business his father had
established, started in conjunction with his
brother Robert the Grafton Argus, and then
succeeded his father as manager of the Graf-
ton branch of the N.S.W. Savings Bank —
the old man had left other work to open the
branch. Another brother, Charles, was
father of Earle Page, the Federal Treasurer,
and Thomas and Charles were both Mayors
of Grafton, and Earle in 1918 was Mayor
of South Grafton. Thomas, who was, if not
a leading official, a member of practically
every society in Grafton, leaves five sons
and four daughters.
William Mcllroy succeeds the late David
Barry as Vic. Public Service Inspector. For
months Mcllroy has been carrying out the
duties under direction from McPherson,
Public Service Commissioner, and knows his
way about. His job is—as the late Premier
William Shiels phrased it—to see that the
Government keeps no cats that don’t catch
mice. Many things are changing in the
public service: contracts are even being let
to pull down walls between rooms so that
Pinktape and Sealing-wax may be kept under
closer surveillance.
Charles Rolling, who died the other day.
will be best remembered by his gift of
£lOO,OOO to establish a school for the orphan
sons of N.S.W. Freemasons. But he hedged
the gift with conditions regarding the train-
ing of boys (having no sons himself, he
naturally had very definite opinions on this
subject)' which caused the United Grand
Lodge to decline the trust. Negotiations
for a settlement were proceeding when he
died. The school nevertheless exists, and
the gift stands as a fine example of benevo-
lence. Rolling came to Australia from the
United States 40 years ago, was chief engineer
at Mount Morgan and Cobar in turn, and
built the first grain-conveyors in Australia
for the N.S.W. Railway Commissioners at
Darling Harbor. He ran the Link-belt Co.
also, and the profits he made he mostly
saved. “Don’t you think I’ve done well with
my money?” he asked a fellow-American a
while ago. The fellow-American said he
thought he could have done better things with
some of it. “Lor instance?” asked Rolling.
“You could have bought a clean suit and
sent your shirt to the laundry,” said his
frank fellow-citizen.
“Olla Podrida” : How’s this for a long-dis-
tance matrimonial record? Mr. and Mrs.
Rent, of Nugent (Tas.), were married in
1846. The dear old lady died last December
in her 99th year and her husband followed
her eight days, later, in liis 100th.
“G.W.C.”: I first met Allenby in the
summer of ’7B, when he was 17 and I a
schoolboy spending my holidays home at Felix-
stowe, on the Suffolk coast, and trying to
learn hpw to.jt.ick on a pony. I still treasure
his mild admonition not to clutch the pommel
of the saddle when in danger of being jolted
off. I have read that in the field of action
Allenby could out-roar the Bull of Bashan;
yet when I met him again the other day at
his uncle’s home in Malvern I found him to
be as quiet and unassuming as when he was
a Haileybury student qualifying for future
failure in the Indian civil service examina-
tions.
When Priminister Bruce reached Welling-
ton (N.S.W.) on a recent election tour, the
first to greet him was Wm. S. Ling, a
Chinese, who is president of the local Hos-
pital Board. The meeting was cordial, as
Bruce and Ling were scholars together at
the Melbourne C. of E. Grammar School.
Ling is now one of the leading storekeepers
of the West.
Mrs. Esther Matthews, reputed the oldest
white inhabitant of Groperland, was only five
years short of the century when she died
at Northam recently. Her father and mother
arrived in the ship Nancy in 1820 and settled
on the upper Swan, where Mrs. Matthews
was born 11 years later. The old lady sur-
vived all her children, but 37 grandchildren,
87 great-grandchildren and 16 great-great-
grandchildren keep the family tree flourish-
ing. Gropcrlanders defy other States to
produce a similarly large army of living de-
scendants of a contemporary ancestor.
The Australian Navy, or what is left of
it, will have an Australian admiral for the,'
first time when Captain G. F. Hyde takes
charge. He will have to be content with the
rank of Commodore, though, so low has the
standard of the R.A.N. fallen as a navy
unit. Hyde started in the mercantile marine
30 years ago, but later joined the silent ser-
vice, and on the formation of the Australian
Navy was selected as commander of the
destroyer flotilla. When the Navy began
to disappear under the feet, of its personnel,
work was still found for Hyde; a little
over a year ago he was appointed to com-
mand the cruiser Vindictive on the China
station.
“Oxmead”: There is at least one other
member of the first House of Reps, who is
alive and hasn’t dropped out of politics be-
sides those mentioned (B. 21/l/’26). This
is .7. W. Rirvvan, who obtained a seat in
the Groperland Leg. Council in 1908, four
years after being dispossessed of his Federal
possie. Rirvvan is chairman of committees
in W.A.’s Upper House nowadays.
The Australian gets everywhere. One
who has just died became a member of the
State Legislature of Washington (U.S.A.).
Edmund Croft, born in Sydney 77 years ago,
left for the Old World with his parents
whilst in his early ’teens, but returned to
take up sheep-raising in M.L. when still a
youngster. Afterwards he was a cane-
grower in Queensland. Then he drifted to
America and did well as a farmer and timber
miller.
Amongst those who looked on when the
new home of the Boys’ Brigade was opened
at Pyrmont (Sydney) was William Henry
Matthews, a prosperous retired citizen of the
Illawarra suburbs who has been a couple of
times Mayor of Rogarah. He was there in
the capacity of an old boy, thankful for what
the brigade did for him in the days when, the
poor son of a blind father, selling papers for
a living, he found healthy recreation in the
brigade’s rooms. After doing various kinds
of odd-job work he decided at 19 to be his
own boss, and his savings sunk in a dealer’s
outfit started a career which led through a
small business in Rogarah to a large one, and
interests in several others. Australia is still
the land of opportunity. The National Par-
liament holds three members whose start in
life wms paper-selling in the streets. P. G.
Stewart, an ex-Minister. is one of them.
R. H. Bettington, the King’s School boy
who showed cricket brilliance before ho
seemed a Rhodes Scholarship, has been given
a place in the Middlesex XI this year He
has already played football for that county
and is the only Australian who has repre-
sented an English county in both games.
He had a similar record at Oxford.
M. B. Ryan, the new Commissioner for
Repatriation, was at the Landing, where he
provided a home for seven bullets. Invalided
back to Australia, he was put to organising
the welfare of other wounded Aussies, and
M. B. RYAN, newly-appointed, Commissioner
of Repatriation.
when the Repat. was formed he was the first
man invited to join Nicholas Lockyer’s staff.
Later he deputy-commissionered in N. S.
Wales and Victoria, finally stepping into the
big job just vacated by Teece.
Edward Randal Scott Stafford, still hale
and hearty at St. Kilda (Vic.), claims to be
the first male child born in Melbourne. His
parents lived in a house at the corner of
Swanston and Collins streets, and there he
was born 8S years ago. His father, John
Stafford, was the first Collector of Customs,
and his grandfather fought at Waterloo.
“2KY”: The fact that a seat on the A.L.P.
executive in Sydney is a sure stepping-stone to
Parliament is well illustrated in the case of
the 1916 executive, notable for expelling the
conscriptionists. Six of the members —Mutch,
Lazzarini, McKell, Burke, O’Brien and
Doyle were shortly afterwards sent to
Macquarie-street. Mutch, Lazzarini and
McKell are now Ministers for the second
time, and the astute A. C. Willis, who was
also one of the ejectors, makes the fourth
to get a Cabinet job. Blakeley and Lam-
bert at present in the House of Reps., and
A.W.U. chieftain Jack Bailey, until the last
election M.L.A. for Goulburn, were other
members of the same executive who later
entered Parliament. The appointment of
five of the present ruling body to the Upper
House is a more recent instance.
There is trouble in the Seamen’s Union
because the Sydney branch wants the Mel-
bourne ditto to clear up the financial mess
it has got into. Tom Walsh, who had been
blamed for letting the finances slide, said he
had almost begged the Vie. officials to bank
their receipts every day. “But.” he asked,
“am I going to cause turmoil among the
branches by trying to compel officials to do
their duty?”
No! Give me all the cheers you like
For my heroic prattle—-
For urging other men to strike
Whilst I eschew the battle.'
But here you hit me where I live—
Your faith gives me no joyance
When you believe I dare to give
The office boy annoyance.
Monsignor P. ,T. Roche, who is managing
the show whilst Dr. Dwyer, Bishop of Mait-
land, is colloguing with the Pope, is a dis-
tinguished scholar and possesses one of the
finest libraries in N. S. Wales. He isn’t
very big and strong, but he is a law. unto all
in the district hard-shell Baptists and
members of the “true Church” alike. When
Dudley de Chair’s uncle, old Viking Rawson.
permitted himself to be inveigled into a tour
of the benighted North lie was taken into
the convent-school at Muswellbrook to hear
little Kathleen play Ilemy’s arrangement of
“Home to Our Mountains” and little Ignatius
recite an ode to Erin’s woes. Sir Harry
bore up as bravely as a sawmill bullock till
the termination of the lStli item, which con-
cluded the first part of the entertainment;
whereupon he started to wilt. It was
Father Roche who delivered his Ex. from
bondage and bore him off to a whisky-and-
soda thoughtfully planted near by, and from
that day to this the name of Roche has
been blessed in the Rawson-De Chair family.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Asked if lie would accept the High Commissioner-
ship were it offered him, Mr. Hughes irrelevantly
observed that he would like to be King of Iraq.”
If I were King, my lads, old Iraq’s King,
My oath! what regal attributes I’d bring
To storied Bagdad on the Tigris’ where
Haroun Alraschid used to take the air!
’Struth! that’s the sort of job I’d love to swing.
With no cantankerous caucus bothering
And no intriguing rivals to beware
If I were King!
If I were King—and once I had a fling
At something very like the real thing.
For years I strutted in the limelight’s glare;
With fame ad libitum and wealth to spare,
I seemed to have Australia on a string.
Give me another chance, I’d tighter cling;
They’d find me harder to depose out there
If I were King.
If I were King I wouldn’t have to sling
The part for want of understudying.
Gripes! when the war was on I had my share
Of homage humble and of incense rare.
Time and again I heard old England ring
With tributes to my lightest uttering.
Hardly could I have been a bigger affair
Had I been King.
If I were King, my lads, if I were King
In glittering Bagdad where the bulbuls sing,
Ah, with what easy grace a crown I’d wear!
What laws I’d frame! What kingly oaths I’d swear!
(Say, what’s the Arabic for “blithering”?
And “blazes”?) Into Tigris spluttering
How quick they’d go who sought my might to dare ~
If I were King!

“FY7”: The death of Mrs. McAuley, an
old resident of North Queensland, brings to mind
a very human aspect of the abo. character. Mrs.
McAuley’s husband was killed long ago by the blacks
near Cairns. The “dispersal party” which went out
rushed the camp of the suspected tribe, and took
prisoner two men, who were identified as the mur-
derers, and a small boy who was with them. One
of the men got away, after a fierce struggle; and,
later, the party was surprised to see him following
them up on the opposite bank of the Mulgrave River.
Finding out that the little boy prisoner was this
murderer’s son, they proceeded to do something to
the youngster in view of the father. The plan
answered; the man crossed the river again, and
was captured. What the avengers did, or threatened
to do, to the little boy has never been told. On the
available evidence, however, the black murderer must
have been about the whitest man present.
“JMorob” : One peculiarity of some of our
sea-snakes is that they are unable to swim in
a straight line, owing to a small flange on the side
of the tail. This has the effect of causing the
creature to shape a course which is always well to
the left, especially when it swims rapidly. The
growth on the snake’s tail is not unlike the caudal
fin of a fish, and when the reptile is motionless it
lies hard against its body. As it is not of any
use to the sea-snake, but is rather a hindrance to its
progress through the water, the chances are that
it really is a rudimentary fin that has been inherited
from ancestors which were more fish than snake,
and that at the present time it is in course of
being completely got rid of by evolutionary influences.
* * * *
“Keppel” : One frequently reads of a wild
boar’s “tusks.” Strictly speaking, a wild boar
has no tusks; what he has are tushes. The grinders
in the upper jaw are really another pair of tushes,
much shorter and thicker than those on the bottom
jaw. The latter are of triangular shape, with sharp
edges and points. It ls with the lower pair that
the wild boar does the damage ; opening his mouth,
he thrusts the point of a tush into his victim,
and the sharp edge cuts like a knife. The tushes
in time grow to great size. A farmer living at
Yeppoon (C.Q.) has a pair of tame boar’s tushes
which, point to point, form a circle with a diameter
of Bin.
* * * *
“Roma”: “Rob” (B. 31/12/’25) writes
that he can grow large palms from date stones but
that they never fruit. James Simmons, of Roma
(Q.), has some palms with trunks Bft. high and
about 20 years old. The females average over lewt.
of excellent fruit yearly. All his palms have been
grown from stones of ordinary shop-bought dates
and the female palms
have been bearing fruit
for over 12 years. It
is a peculiarity that,
though the bees are
thick on the male
flowers in the flowering
season, they never go
near the female flowers,
consequently fertilisa-
tion has to be effected
by piacing some of the
made flowers i,n /the
female palm. As over
90 per cent, of the
plants grown from seed
are males, it is possible
that all the Echuca
(Vic.) palms are
males; but if there
are any females
amongst them, hand-
fertilisation at the
proper time should pro-
duce edible fruit. Mr.
Simmons finds picking
his greatest trouble;
the bunch does not
ripen simultaneously
and he has to take a
few dates from each
bunch daily. He has
heard from various
sources (hat the Arabs
pick whole bunches
green and ripen them
in the sand. Can any
Abo. describe the pro-
cedure ?
“Sucre”: On the
Warrego River (S.-W.
Q.) there are plenty of
date-bearing tree e.
Five years is the age
when the palm first
fructifies. Sea air is
fatal to the plant.
There is no sensible
reason why our tables
shouldn’t be garnished with Australian-grown dates.
“Ragar”: How many eggs constitute a
full clutch for Ma Emu? I was with an old bush-
man in W.Q. when we found 17 of the big green
eggs on the ground. There was no sign of the
mother bird about, but she wasn’t long in putting in
an appearance. My companion declared that from
three to five eggs was the general thing, and that
the 17 before us mast have been the result of
the united efforts of several birds. I’ve found
seven eggs together several times, but never more
till now. Can any member of the Council say with
certainty how many eggs the bird ordinarily lays?
“Soda”: Apropos “Nitric’s” (B. 7/l/’26)
reference to “Coppertop’s” frog (B. 3/12/’25) which
thrived on chlorine gas while men, rats, mice and
lizards took the count, his explanation is that prob-
ably the immunity is due to the fact that the frog
possesses a dual respiratory action, viz., through
lungs and skin. May I ask “Nitric” how, if the
animal is placed in a chlorine atmosphere, it can
avoid taking the gas into its system? Whether res-
piration functions by lungs or skin, the same process
AT 5 A.M.
NEWCHUM : “Nice morning, Boss ?”
COCKY : “Yes, it was.”
of chlorination of the blood takes place. The
method of absorption is immaterial. Chlorine absorbed
gives rise to paralysis of the cerebral membrane, and
hence is narcotic. Then its many hydrides, formed
through solution in the blood, promote corrosive
action on the tissues. In bio. work I have chloro-
formed many dozens of frogs as well as other animals.
Half a teaspoonful of the drug on cotton wool,
placed with froggie in a confined space, will not
only anaesthetise him in less than three minutes,
but will kill him. His heart may continue to pul-
sate for half a day after his demise, but he is not
the less dead, this post mortem function being due
to the fact that his heart is not solely dependent on
the central nervous system. If the animal can adjust
his respirators so as to reject chlorine, why cannot
he reject chloroform? It is unreasonable to suppose
a frog to be immune to the physiological action of
chlorine gas and not to be immune to chloroform,
the action of which is dependant on its being a
chlorine compound.
* * * *
“Anaf ’: While oysters were being dredged
recently on a Moreton Bay (Q.) lease, there was
brought to the surface an object about a foot long,
thickly encrusted with shells and the accumulation
of the sea. When the shells and outer covering had
been removed, it proved to be a bottle of beer, with
the cork still intact. From the number of oysters
and the thickness of the accumulation, the bottle
must have been in the water for many years. One
bold spirit who sampled the contents declared that
they were as good as any fresh from the brewery.
* * * *
“Contractor” : I would refer “Tarago” (B.
31/12/’25) to Leach’s “Australian Bird Book” (page
130) re whipbird, which I assume is his eoachwhip-
bird. I have proved Leach correct in saying that
both birds contribute to the full call. At Seville
(Vic.) I stood motionless for minutes and watched
a pair. Periodically they would perch 6 to 10 ft.
above the short ferns, etc. Once when they rose
about 40ft. apart, I was midway between them. The
male was almost ventriloquial in the first part of his
call and his throat swelled visibly for the final
whip-crack. The female usually", but not always,
replied instantly with from one to three short-vowelled
notes—“Ayoo-ayoo-ayee”—the last note high. The
males I have heard put a short “yoo” between the
“wee-e” and “vvhtt” described by “Tarago.”
“Moreton”: Brisbane people regard the
City Council’s campaign against rats with mixed
feelings. A redeeming virtue in the rodents is that
they keep within bounds a still more prolific pest—
cockroaches. In default of better provender, a
rat will consume from 100 to 200 cockroaches a day.
In the absence of this check it is feared that the
’roaches will increase by millions. The question was
put to Health Commissioner Moore: “How can we
keep down the cockroaches when the rats have
gone?” He replied oracularly: “Encourage the
breeding of frogs.” The common green frog is
generally regarded in Queensland as the champion
cockroach-catcher, and it appears that this view
is shared by the Public Health officials. The
future slogan will be: “Every home its own frogs.”
* * * *
“Hamer”: The black cat which got its
name in the papers by tackling and killing a 3ft.
black snake—-it secured a tooth-grip just behind
the snake's head and
the crawler was unable
to get in a bite —calls
attention to the cat’s
fighting qualities. 1
had a black cat which
suffered a bereavement
over its first litter of
kittens owing to a
marauding stray dog;
the eat rushed back in
time to save a com-
plete tragedy, but two
of her kittens were
dead. After that puss
declared war upon all
dogs, excepting my
own two, with whom
she was very friendly.
Her method was to
walk unconcernedly
along the street until
she got within striking-
distance of a dog which
probably anticipated
a good bit of fun;
then there was a swift
dash and: in a lew
minutes a surprised,
yelping dog was mak-
ing for the horizon try-
ing to shake off the
spitting, scratching
fury that had its claws
well dug in. Dogs
learnt to give the
neighborhood a wide
berth; it was amusing
to see one of them,
after rambling near,
suddenly recollect the
danger that lurked in
the vicinity and make
a sudden bolt for
safety. A hefty bull-
terrier used to have an
almost daily argument
with my collie for the
supremacy of the
suburb, and the battles
were mainly drawn;
but the bully invariably threw in the towel when
puss approached to make a third party to the
discussion.
“Ground Wire”: Death by lightning is
comparatively rare in Australia; the latest to
receive a death-shock were two telegraph linesmen
who were sheltering under a tree in Kangaroo
Valley (N.S.W.). Investigations made in U.S.A.,
Hungary and Germany show that a very small per-
centage of the deaths by lightning—varying from
10 to 15 per cent. —occur under trees. The peril
under some is very much greater than under others.
THE LITTLE RIFT WITHIN THE
LUTE.
“Are you happy with your second wife,
Jacky?"
“I was, Boss. But plurry first one come
home last night.”
German investigation showed that the danger was
57 in the case of the oak, 39 in the case of firs, 5
in the case of pines, and 1 in the case of beeches.
It would be interesting to know whether there is
a greater liability to the effects of lightning under
some of the trees growing in Australia than under
others.

F.A.Q.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A bachelor was William Sice
Who owned a farm at Old Junee,
The kind of man we sometimes meet
Who talks and thinks and dreams of wheat;
He farmed his land by methods new,
And every bag was f.a.q.
Bill thought that he would take a wife—
Was tired, he said, of single life.
Though seeking far and seeking near
No worthy helpmate would appear;
He thought of every girl he knew,
But none he reckoned f.a.q.
His wife, he said, must be a sport
And yet must be a thrifty sort.
All minor faults he’d overlook;
But she must sew and she must cook
Plain food, with now and then a stew,
And bear him children f.a.q.
No jazzing damsel quick to flirt
Nor shingled flapper rude and pert,
She must dress well but not for show,
Shod fiat of heel and broad of toe—
Old maids and widows were taboo,
For they were seldom f.a.q.
And day by day he searched and sought
And lay awake at night and thought.
He schemed of this and planned of that;
He even thought of “View to Mat.”
It’s not such easy work to woo
A woman that is f.a.q.
A schoolmarm came to Old Junee
And William thought her good to see.
Her flaxen hair was neatly bound,
Her skirt reached almost to the ground,
Flat heeled her shoes and roomy too,
Her face and form were f.a.q.
SAME THING—WITH A DIFFERENCE.
LIZ: “Yes, my dear —married five years, and I still kiss my hus-
band good-bye every morning.”
MEG: “So do I, but I have to take care not to wake him up.”
And as he had no time to waste,
He wooed and married her in haste;
And short and sweet the honeymoon—
It lasted through an afternoon.
No wholesome rice the people threw,
But last year’s wheat, not f.a.q.
It turned out right. She chums the cream,
Can ride a horse or drive a team.
Though she may nag once in a while
She mostly wears a cheerful smile.
They count their children two by two,
And every pair is f.a.q.!

MORE PRAISE FOR
CYANOGAS (Calcium Cyanide)
The ONLY Rabbit Exterminator.
Mr. F. J. Hartley, of Palomino, Cumnock, writes, -Novem-
ber 27, 1925: —“1 am on a very rough piece of land,
with hundreds of hollow logs which the 'rabbits live in.
Five weeks ago you could see 150 rabbits in one burrow.
Since I have been using the Blower, I don’t think you
would see a hundred if you rode all over the place. You
can kill them in logs as long as the dust can get past
them. I used one tin in two days When I started, but now
a 51b. tin of Cyanogas does me four days.
It puts the man on the land in a better
position.”
Mr. R. J. Mitchell, of Nulla Nulla
Creek, Macleay River, writes, November
30, 1925: —“I have used your Blower
and Calcium Cyanide and had good suc-
cess, and find Calcium Cyanide is the
only real rabbit-destroyer.”

“FY7”: The new A.W.U. log, just filed
in the Federal Arbitration Court, contains a clause
forbidding employers to charge more than 3d. per lb.
for meat supplied to the shearing sheds. Station
meat has often been a source of friction between
shearers and the station. Often there was good
reason, for some thrifty owners and managers care-
fully culled a special class of sheep (and C 3 at that)
for “shed mutton.'’ Sometimes, too, bad seasons
upset the best intentions of the men who supplied
the meat. There was one such instance on a Barcoo
station of the long ago, the mutton being very low
in condition. After the usual repinings, shearers
and shedhands organised a torchlight procession
which marched to, and round, the station homestead.
The “band’ was composed of kerosene-tins and the
enraged Slushy’s tin dishes, while the “torches”
were the transparent cadavers of the emaciated sheep
carried hanging from poles, each with a lighted
candle inside it.
“Machete”: The camel has now been
added to the Australian big-game shooter’s list. The
other day the South Aus. Government announced
that wild camels, having become a nuisance in the
north-west of that State, may be shot with impunity.
These beasts hate gradually increased in number
until it is estimated that there are between two
and three thousand which have lapsed into a wild
state and know no owner. The}’ are exceedingly
wild and wary, and mop up a lot of water.
“Parama”: Prior to the arrival of mis-
sionaries on Darnley Island, Torres Strait, when a
headman, or anyone held in more than usual
respect, died, his body was taken in hand by four
or five professional embalmers. Incisions were made
behind the knees, above the elbows and at the base
of the skull to drain off all blood and other fluid ;
the brains and eyes were then removed, also the
intestines and internal organs. The embalmers,
their nostrils stuffed with certain aromatic leaves,
then squeezed and massaged the flesh free of moisture.
Great care was taken to preserve the cast of the
features, especially the nose, which they protected
by filling with clay. The flesh shrank as it dried,
till it resembled cured beche-de-mer. The drying took
about three weeks. Marine eats’-eyes or shaped
pieces of m.o.p. were then inserted as eyes, and the
head was polished with a mixture of cocoanut-oil
and cocoanut-shell charcoal. A white wood “kere-
kube” — a n Sin. stick about a= thick as an ordinary

lead-pencil and sharpened at both ends —-was then
thrust through the nose from side to side, and the
ears were decorated with shreds of arrowroot-leaves.
The body was lightly oiled all over and supplied
with a pubic shell, and then placed on a bamboo
stretcher, to be taken and presented to the widow
or nearest relative. If the weather was dry, the
body was then placed upright, leaning against the
outside of the hut, beside the entrance, so that all
people could see it and welcome it back with
friendly words. Two days later it was taken inside,
there to stand against the wall, opposite the doorway,
where it remained, being spoken to daily by the
living occupants of the hut, and being taken outside
only now and then for a drying in the sun and
wind. After two or three years—considerably sooner
if the widow happened to have a second husband in
view—the body became shabby through neglect and
damp and the flesh began to decay. The head was
then taken off, put in a woven basket and suspended
under the grass thatch of the roof. The body was
buried without further ceremony.

“Harold Freslibait’’: The behavior of two
pilot-fish was an interesting side-show at the capture
of an lift. 9in. tiger-shark in Carell Bay (N.S.W.)
lately. The pilot-fish, which were evidently on the
shark’s staff, seemed to be genuinely agitated by
the predicament of their boss, and whilst he was
being hauled in one of them leapt out of the water
on to his back when his body showed above the
sea surface. They both followed into the shallow-
water, and one was captured-—a small fellow, fiin.
long. The other, Which ran to about 15in., cruised
about near the beach for two hours after the shark
had been landed.
“Pick": “Stephen R.” complains (B.
14/l/’26) that he cannot find an Australian wood
handle sufficiently strong to withstand the yawing
and wrenching on his coal-pick. Let me recom-
mend him to seek an old lillipilli-tree with stout
young shoots springing from its truhk. A sucker
selected from the bunch thick eiiough to suit
without packing or paring will prove as tough and
durable as wire-rope. Moreover, after a short period
of use it will be beautifully smooth and yielding
in his hands, and will not sun-crack.

“Really’’: Victoria has a decent herd of
camels, too, 98 being employed carting salt from
the I nderbool Pink Lakes to the railway. They
have done great work, but, even so, people living
thereabouts have not taken greatly to them. A
mob of six which were impounded near Ouyen
(Vie.) were sold, and only £1 could be obtained for
six of them; some prime young ones which were
disposed of at the same place realised only ss. each.

“Gouger” : Horses often possess an uncanny
instinct for boggy ground, especially animals that
are bred on or have travelled ovjer treacherous
country. In Cape York Peninsula during the wet
season large stretches of the lowlands are almost
morasses. ' Boggy country often looks quite firm
and natural under a crust ot* sun-baked eaith. The
pack-horses in single file thread in and out between
these traps. Should the leader come to a “puzzler"
he will stop and sniff the ground ahead. Probably
he will swing at right angles and edge around the
suspicious spot. Otherwise he’ll paw the giound
before trusting his weight to it. Experienced team-
horses very seldom flounder, but a venturesome,
nag from strange country inay easily find himsell !
sunk in mud tt> the saddle-packs. Generally he
has to be shot.
* * * *
“FY7”: The scrub turkey builds his rub-
bish heap many feet high, but is not so foolish as to
put the eggs far into the pile. They are laid
in holes about a foot deep round the top and side
of the mound, and are then covered up by the
cock bird. After that the parents keep the surface
raked loose, but give no aid to the chick when
hatched. The queer little beggar works . his way
out through the loose covering, and at once makes
for cover and fends for himself.

“Jim Carew”: One of the least known
and most ingenious of Binghi’s weapons was the
werpoo, an instrument
designed to kill and
leave little trace behind
it. It was usually
made from the hind-leg
bone of a kangaroo.
This was scraped down
until it became a long,
thin, : slightly-curved
instrument, the thickest
part being about a
quarter qf an inch wide
and dotible that in
thickness. It took two
Binghis ,to manipulate
a werpoo. The victim
was seized and held
in position on the
ground by one
W’hilst the other in-
serted the instrument
beneath the skin and
pushed it till the point
Was opposite a vital
part. There the weapon
was turned and twisted
gently until the vital
organ was pierced. The
weapon was then with-
drawn a,nd the punc-
ture kept tightly
closed to prevent bleed-
ing. This left little
trace, and unless the
use of the werpoo was suspected, death was attributed
to natural causes.
“Adelaide” : I think a friend of mine can
beat all the claims as to chance hits (8.. 7/l/’26).
At a picnic he was carrying: a billy to the
creek for water, with some gills, when a rabbit
showed itself in a bush near by. “Go away, you!”
he said playfully, and slung the billy in its direc-
tion. Result, one tin slightly dented and one rabbit
perfectly dead. It took the surprised marksman
a long time to live down his reputation for uncanny
deadliness with missiles.
“Up North”: Some N.Q. river niggers
have a slick method of catching cels. A dozen worms
are threaded through a loop of split lawyer-cane.
A fibre string is attached to the loop and a stick
to the string. A fire is lit on the bank at night
and : the looped bait gently lowered up and down
in the water. AVhen an eel fastens his teeth in the
bait he is jerked straight over the angler’s shoulder,
and the bait is then relowered ready for any other
visitors attracted by the blaze of fire upon the dark-
water.
“Polycarp”: When choosing a safe sanc-
tuary for the last stand of our rarer birds we shall
have to oust the goanna from the territory. He is
a worse bird-killer than all the youngsters, foxes
and snakes put together. The go’ can reach almost
any nest, whether in the treetops, inside hollow
limbs, or in underground tunnels. No wonder
that in the breeding season the feathered clans join
forces and go mad with excitement when a goanna
is seen. »•
“Julian”: The worst collection of sore-
heads I ever encountered was at Hayser’s Find, beyond
Kanowna (W.A.). The landlord of the newly-opened
pub had handed over temporary charge to a rather
inexperienced relative when a party of prospectors
who had placed their lease under option to a big
English co. and got a substantial deposit came in
AN APPEAL FOR LAW AND ORDER.
EX-HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION: “ Here, stick to the rules,
Sarah. Give a Hoke ten seconds when ’e goes
down
to celebrate their luck by shouting for the whole
adult population of the Find. Mere beer and
whisky seemed hardly worthy of the great occasion,
so they told the amateur barman to open up all the
best bottled stuff he could fetch or find. Champagne
had not trickled far through the mulga in 1896,
but ' Bung’s locum tenons unearthed case after
ease of liqueurs, and ranged the bottles along the
counter. The prospectors scorned ‘long glasses.
“Nothing like that when we’re shouting—let ’em
have a proper drink.” they directed. That was how
it started, and when the publican got back he
found the bar filled with goggle-eyed men with bulg-
ing j heads and damaged throats, who had been
drin|ing out of ordinary beet- glasses an assortment
of afeinthe, vermouth, creme de menthe, curaeoa and
greeh and yellow chartreuse. There were no actual
fatalities, though a reveller had his face badly
grav'ql-rashed while trying to root out a burrow
the impression that he had been, changed into
a wqmbat. Bung had to place the celebrants under
various degrees of the Dog Act to restore them to
sobriety and sanity.

“The Rumpus” : We were crossing Ford’s
Creek (W.A.) —in the early days, one, Ford picked
up -a 70oz. slug of pure gold there—at a place
studded with immense waterworh boulders. Abbiq,
the half-caste, with eyes like a
hawk, spotted the glint of gold
deep down in a crevice where two
great gibbers tried to press each
other out of the water-way. It
was only a pin-head he had caught
sight of, but probing with a long
thin stick revealed a surface oi
clean, smooth-worn metal. In-
stant)}' we were all excitement at
the idea of finding a large nugget,
and plans were discussed as to the
best means of reaching it. In
the absence of explosives we were
forced to unsling the picks and
crowbar, our shovels being use-
less. To get to the boulders we
had to start yards away, easing
each big, , stone to let its com-
panion stone, move. This alone
took half a day in the burning
sun. When finally we reached
the giant we proposed to move
we found it larger at the base
than above. It was only towards
afternoon that our efforts were
rewarded by the obstruction mov-
ing 7in. Arms shot into the fis-
sure, whilst sand and dirt flew
in all directions. The object of
our Tabor was quickly exposed in
the palm of the half-caste, whose

arm was longest. Without doubt it was gold —the
dirt-filled casing of a gold watch.
* * * *
“Moe” : It is probable that the gorgeously-
plumaged bird seen in Northern Australia by “AdeL”
(B. 7/l/’26) was the paradise-bird, which at certain
seasons of the year may cross Torres Strait from
New Guinea for a short period. Whenever it does
so it seems to travel by itself. Not long ago a
man who knows that part of Australia well told
me that on the Staten and Nassau Rivers he had
seen numbers of isolated specimens.
“Irel”: Thte Murwillumbah district of N.
S. Wales has two small towns labelled Sleepy Hollow
and Urliup. Being’ in the centre of the cow-country,
the latter may be regarded as the more appropriate,
* * * *
“Murua” : The village pig of the swamp-
dwelling tribes that have their H.Q. at the head
of the Dyke. Ackland Bay, lives an
unusual life. Born in a wooden cage,
he spends his days in a wooden pen
over the water, and is killed and
eaten without ever seeing land. These
swamp-dwellers are the so-called
“web-footed” tribes of Papua. Rarely
do they visit solid land, existing on
the fish, game and vegetable foods
that thrive in the great dark swamps.
“X2X”: Recently there have
been some eases of sickness among
human beings in Queensland which
have been traced ultimately to the
poultry-tick, the small, louse-like
insect which is so great a pest to
poultry-owners, and investigations
have demonstrated beyond doubt that
this creature is capable of setting up
pathological conditions in man. In
the majority of cases the conditions
have taken the -form of a fever which,
though slight in the beginhing, gradu-
ally increases, and is accompanied by
headaches and, in acute cases, by
vomiting. Generally the symptoms
pass off in a few days, or as soon
as the tick is got rid of by the
infected person, but the interesting
aspect of the matter is that in many
ways this tick closely resembles the
Central Asian insect of the same sort
which in that ■ part of the world is
the cause of widespread ' damage to
both man and beast. This tick is,
of course, more virulent than the Aus-
tralian type, but there is a chance
always that the Queensland insect,
finding itself in a suitable environ-
ment, may evolve into a form as
harmful as the Asiatic.
“Km” : There are two distinct species of
pearl-shell found in the waters of the nor’-west of
Australia —the smaller found in Shark Bay - and known
scientifically, as Mcleagrina imbricala, and the much
larger and more valuable foufid around the Broome
beds and known as Meleagrina margaritifiers. Be-
sides being ever so much smaller than the Broome
pearl-shell, the Shark Bay shell is yellow, and the
small pearls and “baroque” are likewise yellow.
The pearls and shell from Broome are, as a rule,
white, though now and then gold-tinged pearls and
“baroque” turn up.
* * » *
“Sucre”: I’ve spent the best part of my
life in districts where pawpaws, male and female,
grow, and deny that there is danger to the
human being through sleeping near the male
tree. Dr. Bancroft, who thought there might be
danger, was a surgeon; against his belief I range
that of Dr. Lucas, biologist, who made a study of
the pawpaw, and put on the market a valuable
ointment derived from the plant.
“Jim Carew”: I am surprised at “Te Babarantiko”
(B. 31/12/’25) saying that neither he nor his wife
ever heard of trie ill-effect the flowering of .the pawpaw
tree has on persons sleeping near it I should have
thought every man, woman and child in the tropics
and sub-tropics knew of it. When we first moved to
Rockhampton we had an experience of its potency.
There was a flowering pawpaw just outside my
sister.’s bedroom window, and in about six weeks she
became so weak and nervy that she had to be sent
south for a long change. When she left my brother
occupied the room, and when the same symptoms
showed on him my father asked some men what
they thought of jt. They didn’t need to come and
inspect the room. They told him what was the cause
of it, and our house had a general re-arrangement.

The State Governor de Chairs are talking
of a visit to Lord Howe Island before their
term of office is up. Lord Howe comes with-
in the jurisdiction of the Governor of N. S.
Wales, so it will be one of those rare occa-
sions on which duty and pleasure go hand-
in-liand. Talking of Governors and honors
and such-like, it’s amusing to listen to the
note of indifference —almost of captiousness
—towards State Governors that has crept
into many Toryish voices since the privilege
of recommending for honors is no longer in
the gubernatorial box of tricks, so far, at
any rate, as two or three States are con-
cerned.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers, who took the stage as
Mary Hinton and made her first appearance
as Lady Mary. Carlisle in “Monsieur Beau-
caire,” is the first daughter of an ex-Governor
General to join the profession in Australia.
As the Belle of Bath she was not very con-
vincing, though nature has stocked her
armory of good looks to overflowing. In
“Beaucaire,” maybe, it was the period clothes
that cramped her style. One film-producer
says that it is imagination, not beauty of
figure, that is the successful wearer of old-
time raiment. But, anyway, the social fol-
lowing that was expected to positively storm
the theatre on the lady’s -appearance failed
to ; come down on the Royal with the im-
petuosity of a wolf on the fold. There’s a
gulf, Wide nnd deep, between a G.-G. in the
bush and an ex-G.-G. in the Strand, or
wherever ex-Exes. do congregate.
“Give me a needle and I’ll sow my wild
oats,” says the funny young man in “Katja.”
And that, apparently, is what the daughters
of the peerage, the beerage and the local
sheepstakes have adopted as their slogan.
Every woman with a bit of spare cash is be-
coming her own shopkeeper. Katherine
Osborne (D’Arcy’s attractive young daugh-
ter) .Ik one of the latest to dash into the
ranks of fig-leaf purveyors; Ernest Watt’s
daughter Pauline has been in the sewing and
ripping trade for the past eight or nine-
months ; and the fair, slim, beauteous and
agate-eyed wife of Lord Hastings hadn’t even
seen the harbor before she buzzed into part-
nership with a Melbourne fluff firm. Lady
Hastings is a daughter of the Marquis Casati,
who is chamberlain to the King of Italy;
she and her husband passed through Sidney
Ul the week-end looking none the worse for
their romance.' The Viscount, son of the
Earl of Huntingdon and grandson of Vic-
toria’s old squatter “Salmon” Wilson, will
jaekeroo in the Riverina while his wife is
attending to the human sheep.
The Governor-General came to Sydney
for the regatta on Anniversary Day, and
the Orvieto, the flagship of the occasion, was
a colony of important people. The official
luncheon was spread in its dining-hall, and
here cheek by cheek sat Lord Stonehaven,
1 riminister Bruce, Gaudmayor Stokes, and
Church, Army and Navy represented by
Commodore V ardle, General Bruche and
Archgaiters. Wright. Old salts, too, like
Alvr,ed- ! lSSilson, David Garment and Anjdrew
Wilson Wte among the hundred or
who listened to the new G.-G.’s

breeze. On such a day Governor
I landed in Sydney Cove; now,
later, somewhere about half a

ot the tough old captain for making the
holiday possible.
One hundred and thirty years ago the

of course lie s half a Scottfe, atoyway) added
liis forget-me-not to the afternoon’s bouquet.
But he had to keep to poetry, for Burns en-
thusiasts decried a few tentative attempts
at politics. Bunting and laurels wreathed
the statue, and at its base was enshrined a
picture of the poet lad of Ayr. The pipes
shrilled and droned, the words of old Scots
songs. rose liltingly, and were etched (as
scientists aver) for ever into the atmosphere:
and maybe a rose that blooms next week
near by will hold a richer gleam, a sweeter
fragrance because of them.
Every man who goes down to the sea at
Sydney in skiffs knows David Carment. His
life’s job was in the figure-juggling depart-
ment of the A.M.P., but at heart he is a
regular Captain Kidd. He is one of the in-
domitables of the Royal Sydney Yacht
Squadron, and was vice-commodore of the
Royal Prince Alfred Club for four years.
The other night he and Mrs. David had a
party at their home in North Sydney to cele-
brate that 27tli of January, in 1576, when
they were married at St. Philip’s, on Church
Hill. The Governor-General sent a tele-
gram of congratulation, and so did the Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science; old
yachting friends made a presentation of gold
plate.
As this Letter is rubbing on its pink lip-
stick Barbara Bowker is meeting Allan
Graeme Potter at St. Mark's, “view to mat.”
And before you can read this the honeymoon
set in the Arthur Allens’ Port Hacking home
will be hours old, the wedding tryst having
duly taken place under the gaze of not less
than 300 mortals (“church and breakfast
inc.”). Barbara is a daughter of the medi-
cal Steer Bowkers, of Edgecliff, and on her
mother’s side inherits the blonde good looks
that distinguish the Marks family. The
bridegroom witli the name like a breakfast
food has interests in the Shire line, and has
been gaining practical knowledge of shipping
during the past year at No. 4 Bridge-street.
A wedding with a Queensland bloom hap-
pened in the . cool of an evening last week
when the Church of St. Benedict’s, in George-
street West, blessed the vows, of Sylvia Mac-
millan and William Cummings. The bride
is a daughter of the M. L. Macmillans, of
Lochinvar (N.Q.), and the bridegroom hails
from Townsville. Ivory rose point over petal
pink georgettes was assembled in the wed-
ding garment, together with orange buds and
a train of Limerick lace, once the wedding
veil of the bridegroom’s mother, a noted
Queensland belle. Bride's sister Edna
'maided in georgettes of faintest primrose
that sported one of the new sashes in blue
ribbon velvet. Velvet, too, swathed the blue
crinoline hat, and red roses and blue del-
phiniums were the finishing word. The
bride’s mother; served supper at the Carlton.
Cool greeny waters and mermaids are the
interests of the lady in this picture. She
is Mrs. W.
Chambers; and
for 13 years
she lias been
the secretary
for love of the
N.S.W. Ama-
teur Ladies’
Swimming
A.s so elation.
Until last year
she was also
the club’s offi-
cial starter,
but now, with
300 girls tak-
ing part in
swimming con-
tests, she finds
that jiart of
the work be-
yond her. She
still thrills
over the Fanny
Durack and Mina Wylie days, although the
most exciting race she has ever watched
was that between Claire Couldwell and
Muriel Allen last year in Melbourne. The
two swam neck to neck from the start, and
at the last Claire beat the Victorian by a
mere touch. The association started with
five clubs; now it embraces 25, and, through
Mrs. Chambers’s suggestion, periodic visits
of international champions are being arranged,
St. James’s put a knot of tiger-lilies above
its ear, flicked the feather-duster over the
pews, flung down the carpet and was all
smiles when Ailsa Beryl Tweedy, of Quambi,
Wongarbon, blushing into her veil, arrived
on brother Keith’s arm. James Aubrey Kerr,
of Wollstonecraft, waiting at the altar,
blushed too, but this Letter drops a veil over
his confusion, ivory georgettes, crystal-beaded
and drawing a foam of train, enfolded the
bride, who was further embellished by two
bridesmaids. They were Vida Stedman and
Boris Duncan, and their passing was
marked by a trail of lilac and silver. Tiny
Dutch lace caps added to their effective
scheme. The bride’s mother did .the bailors
later at the Carlton.
Holy Trinity Church, Orange, saw the
grafting of one old country family on to
another when Rita Glasson, of Tremearne,
Lucknow, and Cyril Low, of St. Clair,
Bathurst, exchanged vows. The bride looked
tremendously impressive in ivory satins em-
broidered in rhinestones and silver beads, a
train of transparent tulle weighted with her-
baceous borders in rhinestones and silver, and
an Ikon of the same glittering gems, which
moored surging billows of tulle to the bride’s
graceful head. Like a Kate Greenaway illus-
tration were the three ’maids, in ivory satins
and lace frills allied to poke bonnets
wreathed with baby roses; and two tiny
trainbearers, June Walton and Dawn
Gibbes, in high-waisted, ankle-long taffetas
and strap shoes, were also in the picture. At
the reception the bride’s mother came into
the spotlight, and bore it bravely in a cycla-
men frock, delicately patterned in steel
beads and bordered with chinchilla.
Herewith a May Moore picture of Harry
Sergeant, amateur comedian, better known
as “Seg.” He
is the new pre-
sident of the
Idlers, a smart
group of en-
tertainers
whose idling is
done in the
cause of char-
ity. For 27
years “S eg”
has sung his
funny songs
and invented
yards of amus-
ing patter on
amateur pro-
grammes ; he
has entertained
p r a c t i cally
every institu-
tion in and
around Syd-
ney, and only
a week or two ago lie liad the 250 boys at
the Gosford Farm Home laughing uproari-
ously at his part of the Idlers’ . entertain-
ment in the Home’s biggest dormitory. “Seg”
is an old Rugby-footer champion, and dates
back to the days of the Buccaneers. When
Hot performing with the Idlers or fishing at
Woy Woy, he is a revenue-sleuth at the Cus-
toms House.
Pretty Muriel Dalton, of Randwick, a
daughter of the late E. B. Dalton, of Orange,
has decided to enter into matrimony soon
with Owen J. Goldrick, of Rose Bay.
The tinkle of approaching wedding-bells
is heard in the theatrical world. One of
the coming events is the marriage of Maurice
Tuoliy to Lily Molloy, who claims to have
appeared in her young life in 250 plays,
mostly as soubrette. She was playing Sarah
in “On Our Selection” when the Neil-Tuohy
combination (now at the Newtown Majestic)
started at the New Palace in Melbourne; but
Bert Bailey released her in order that she
might join her fiance’s company. Miss Cave,
of “The Farmer’s Wife” company, who is a
Jewess, will keep to her faith by marrying
a Jewish Melburnian, annexed during' the
company’s short stay in the southern capital;
and Gracie Savieri, just back from picturis-
mg with Hurley in the Islands, is also con-
cerned about the preparation of a trousseau.
In the years that are gone, when Potts
Point was a stylish address and homes cov-
ered the waterfront, the McQuades, of
Tarana, were one of Sydney’s best-known
families. Now Tarana is a flattery, like its
neighbors, and the remaining McQuades live
mostly in England. News came the other
week that “Babe,” the last single daughter
of the family, is entering into matrimony
by way of golf with a links champion.
Baronet Ernest Holderness. The pair met
at the famous Walton Heath course, which
is the baronet’s chief playing-ground. In
addition to being twice a golf champion, Sir
Ernest has the job of assistant secretary at
the Home Office. '
The just-published intermediate pass-list
contains the name of Somerset Struben de
Chair—the first Governor’s son to get through
, a?* 11 ?’ He k a d A’s in English, Latin
ana Mathematics ■ — a very creditable pass,
seeing that he is barely 14£. He is at King’s,
and was the youngest of that old
school’s candidates.
r • T ] iat r, ch ampion of dumb friends, Mrs.
Linda Prince, is back in Sydney after nearly
12 months m England and Scotland. Dnr-
mg her stay in London she visited every
dogs home on the humane society’s list, and
was delighted with the affectionate care that
all the superintendents show towards their
charges. _ Dogs, these days seem to Pave a
better time than composer^—especially the
ballad or “art” song-writer. When Mrs
Prince approached Chappells with some of
her works, they shook thfeir heads. . “There
is no demand for songs,” they said; “when
one of the great singers wants a particu-
lar verse set to music, some well-known
music-writer is commissioned to do the job.
But if you have anyjazz”—— And here an
eager hand was thrust towards her MS.
This is her note on the clothes that will
bloom in Sydney’s auturrfn: Some of the
newest French models are built on the
Princess line, and their full skirts are cut
in sections. Black satin seems u favorite
medium for expressing this style. Godets
many declare are not to be with us this
autumn, but a kind of rich relation to last
year’s godet has been evolved. They are now
more complicated and form more or less
circular side-pieces to the skirt. These give
an alluring kick to the tailored dress carried
out in navy blue and fine serge suitings.
Buttons will be “off” this winter, and dyed
fur will be looked down upon, even at the
jumble. Taffetas will be seen again, and
waistlines will be higher than last year, but
not so high as was expected—just a little
below the normal. Black velvet is decidedly
“in” again, and for straight-out coloring
you can’t go wrong with grey or bottle-green.
Fifteen or twenty years ago the most strik-
ing personality in Maoriland that tourists
were likely to meet was Maggie Papakura,
the guide at Rotorua. Her intelligence, her
vivacity and her knowledge of her race and
country made her world-famous. Event-
ually she married a wealthy Englishman, and
Ao-Tea-Roa and the tourists knew her no
more. Then came the Great War, and hun-
dreds of soldiers with the fernleaf badge
invalided at Wolton-on-Tliames learned
their way to Beckworth, a beautiful Thames-
side mansion, where Maggie, transmogrified
into Mrs. Staples-Brown but with as warm
an affection for her homeland as ever, enter-
tained them royally. The lady is now re-
visiting the scenes from which she has been

The Clerical Women War Workers are
frowning thoughtfully into an empty cash-
box. During last winter’s unemployment
they gave a helping hand to 58 ex-soldiers,
they still _ continue their fortnightly visits
to Randwiek, and at Christmas they made
things happier for the sufferers there with a
jollo. Now not even all the tliripponny-bits
which these young women looted from the
plum-pudding can make a sound like high
finance in the treasury. Who's going to help
them carry on in 1926? Address / cheques

Listen to these naturalist outfits worn by
some of the women at Tirranna, according
to one paper’s social notes: “Fawn costume,
shrimp hat”; “mole costume, salmon hat”;
“oyster costume, tomato sunshade, olive hat.”
The last only needs a roll in the stocking
to make a meal of it.'
Miss Brisbane’s week :
The “Moth of Moonbi” film, when shown in Bris-
bane, beat even the records of “The Ten Command-
ments” for houses and booking, despite high tem-
peratures and trying weather generally. Parties of
bush folk came to pick out familiar landmarks and
friends amongst the cast. Billy Stokes and Marsden
Hassall, who play respectively Josephine (the black-
gin from “The Wild Moth”) and Tom Resoult, the
hero, came in for much hand-clapping. The young
producer, Charles Chauvel, made a speech about
picture-making on the final night, ere the “Moth”
flitted on to the suburban theatres.
Mrs. E. E. Edwards gave a “china” tea at Len-
nons’ for bride-elect- Jessie Mooney. The pretty
hostess was in brown with a blue hat, and the
guest of honor in lemon crepe de Chine with a
peacock-blue roof. Mrs. Forth also hostessed a party
in Miss Mooney's honor.
Another bride-to-be is Nancy Power, who goes on
the Tango Maru to China, where Frank Smith meets
her with the ring. Herries Forth gave a party for
her amongst pink asters at her Clayfield home. The
principal guest was in white and gold, and Mah
Jongg passed the hour.
For the Toowong Bowling Club’s majority the
lfiwns were dressed with Chinese lanterns and gay
electric bulbs. President and Mrs. T. B. Wightman
received a big roll-up, and there were jazzing, singing
and supping in the moonlight. A big birthday cake
was ornamented with 21 candles, and a chocolate
latch-key was among the presentations. Mrs. Wight-
man wore black and silver; her daughter pink.
Much blue frocking appeared at Ascot for the
second January meeting. Mrs. Tilling had an
amethyst scarf with her blue, Mrs. Crombie (Long-
reach) was in cream, Mrs. H. L’Estrango in black
and white, Mrs. Whittingham chose amethyst, and
Mrs. Sligo grey and fuchsia. Pat O’Shea had a
tea-party on the committee’s verandah, and amongst
those on the lawn were the Lieut.-Governor, the
Cecil Palmers, the E. Q. Blumes and Major 8011.
Laurie Shannon, who is to marry William Green,
was feted by Alma and Kathleen McDonnell at their
Eagle Junction home in a setting of red and gold.
For Jean Cramond the Schofields gave a shivoo
amid bowls of purple and pink asters and copper-
liued zinnias. Every guest brought something in
china for the bride-elect. The hostess was in navy
crepe de Chine, her daughter in oyster-grey, and
Jean Cramond in navy and grey.
Dr. Reg Williams (Crow’s Nest) and Fthel,
elder daughter of the Brompton Farm Cooks, took
each other for keeps at St. James’s, Toowoomba,
the bride in ivory satin with silver tissue, the
bridesmaids, Constance and Amelia Cook, in pink
and blue respectively. The ’moon rose over Strad-
broke Island.
Fred Bluett is coming back to Brisbane this
week, and •will appear at Cremome in “The
Crackers,” a new company collected by Roberts.

Federal Government House flagstaff will
appear in the nude for the next week, for
the G.-G. and his lady have left for the
Apple Isles ; official engagements include the
Hobart regatta and Cup meeting.
There was a democratic diffusion of social
rank in the crowd that went down to the sea
in ships and swarmed up the gangway of the
Iwate when the captain of that venerable
warboat gave a reception. Feminine guests
could have found occupation for six or eight
pairs of hands, as they endeavored to restrain
skirts that emulated parachutes, clutch their
parasols, accumulate a gross or so of the silk
flags, postcards, fans, programmes and other
welcoming trifles bestowed upon them from
both sides, and bob under awnings, fully
laden. Officers set out to keep everyone well
amused, and their own evident enjoyment
of the programme was infectious. Beneath
gay decorations of lanterns, flowers and
streamers, quite a variety entertainment was
given. There were displays of jiu-jitsu, the
dexterous art being demonstrated by stocky
petty officers. There was also fencing with
long bamboo-sticks to the accompaniment of
shrieks and yells. The fencing costume was
of a sort to win enthusiastic shouts from our
beach censors, consisting of navy blue ankle-
deep skirts, white and blue figured shirts,
bonnet-like millinery, and a visor. The finale
was a procession of fantastic characters
drawn from Japanese fairy lore, including
a badger, an elephant, a maiden riding a
turtle, swordsmen who gave a weird dance,
and a bevy of geishas in red and white
kimonos, who distributed paper blossoms
add gracefully tripped to the warbling of
an officer with Harold Lloyd spectacles and a
smile to correspond. The programme bore
the hospitable and informative footnote:
“Remark —Refreshments for ladies, after
deck; refreshments for gentlemen, ward-
room.” Scorching heat and a sirocco upset
these well-laid plans, however, so all re-
freshed in a mighty crush below decks. Saki,
poured into the tiniest of blue-and-white
basins from small blue-and-white vases, was
sampled, and the thimblefuls were pro-
nounced not very palatable. Admiral Hall-
Thompson, his wife in georgette raiment of
wood-brown hue, and daughter Rosemary m
a white frock, was there, and Mayor Brunton
brought his lady, who wore black millinery
topping mole georgette and ecru lace robing.
The vexed question of how to keep the Red
Cross flying in the piping times of peace was
given a good threshing at the annual meet-
ing of the Vic. division of the society, held
at Anzac House. The State Governor’s lady,
from the chair, suggested action, on the lines
of the Bush Nursing Association, to help the
folk outside the metropolis to get assistance
in times of illness. Her Ex. didn’t travel
through the Backblocks and the Northern
Territory for nothing. The idea probably
will be discussed at a special conference. As
Red Cross moneys were given for war service
only, a separate fund would have to be
raised for other work. The accounts showed
that the Vic. division spent £34,389 last
year, of which administration accounted for
more than £5OOO. The fund itself still stands
at close upon £140,000. Senator • Guthrie
put up a big plea for support for the sol-
diers’ furniture factory, which has struck
bad times, and from which Repat. has with-
drawn its subsidy. As this was the last
yearly gathering at which the Countess would
preside, chairman of the executive O. M.
Williams had the good deeds of the Gover-
nor’s lady put on record.
The A.N.A.’s show at the Exhibition gives
125 manufacturing firms a chance to tell
what Australia can do if it puts its mind to
it. Governor Stradbroke, at the opening,
mentioned that the exhibits of Whybrow’s
footwear and Macßobertson’s sweets had
already been shown at Wembley. Goldman,
whose furniture fashioned from our own
forest timbers received honors at Wembley
and Panama, also had some of his pieces on
show. His Ex. and Lady Stradbroke spent
the whole afternoon doing the rounds, with
aide Bircliam as catalogue-collector and
pantechnicon. Feminine eyes rested affec-
tionately on stacks of lovely moth-proof
flannels and blankets from the Collins fac-
tory at Geelong. But the sex was not
allowed to specialise in admiration of the
silk hosiery branded Prestige and Lustre; a
maiden in glistening evening-gown displayed
stockings which seemed to exercise a fatal
fascination on male bipeds, especially those
whose hair is getting thin on top. Mac-
Robertson’s huge show-cases, made of ex-
quisite Australian fiddle-back blackwood,
were an impressive ad. apart from their con-
tents. Anzac tweeds were shown in the mak-
ing, and another soldier industry, cane fur-
niture, was well to the fore. The Forster
Carpet Co. showed the innards of uphol-
stered furniture as well as the husk, and
there was an intriguing array of Persian
carpets—made in Melbourne.
Swanston-street on a recent. Sunday after-
noon was like a fair. First, there were
the novel thrills of electric transit to St.
Kilda to be sampled. Just over Princes
Bridge the band from the Japanese training-
ship Iwate was making music in Queen Vic-
toria Gardens. And across the road at
Wirths’ Olympia six pipe bands conscien-
tiously endeavored to do justice to Burns’s
birthday, the usual anniversary gathering
round the bard’s statue on St. Kilda-road
having been dropped owing to the upheaval
of that boulevard. The visitors from Cherry-
Blossom Land made a collection for the
Mayor’s fund. When Admiral Saito was
here in 1924 with the squadron he permitted
the showing of exclusive films of the big
’quake, which netted £l2O for the Mayor’s
charities and hospital fund, and a founda-
tion membership was his reward. Nippon
has not forgotten.
Trade-Commissioner Elmer Pauly and his
wife, who return by the Aorangi to the land
where lager is an outlaw, were the centre of
a jazz party with trimmings of paper caps
and other frivolous trifles given by the Ameri-
can Club at Admiralty House. Mrs. Pauley
faced the music in an almond-green gown
sprinkled and fringed with silver. A black
robe with feathered trimming was the choice
of Mrs. W. V. McGee, the club president’s
lady.
When the world went fighting in 1914
a Melbourne girl, Mollie Carew, organised a
concert co. known as “The Girls Who Stayed
at Home,” which added many thousands of
pounds to war-relief /funds. Besides being
accompanist, she contributed songs at the
piano. Shortly after the start Cupid stepped
in and Mollie Carew left for London and
a matrimonial engagement with Dr. Heaton
Smith. Last week Mrs. Smith came back
with her eight-year-old daughter for a fleet-
ing glimpse of her home-town. She took
to song-writing after her marriage—she was
a University Conservatorium student here—
and is now one of the six who are under
contract to Chappells to turn out three songs
a year—the half-dozen include such doughty
songsmiths as Guy d’Hardelot, Herman Lohr
and Montague Phillips. Her biggest success
—and Chappells’—is “Love’s a Merchant.”
Her best song, after approval by Rosiua
Buckman, was published by Cramer’s, but
Chappell’s took all the others. She draws
splendid royalties from America, whence
comes a request that she will arrange some
of her compositions for choral societies.
Representatives of the State’s and Tassy’s
solidest merino families filled the pews at
Scots’ Church, and later clustered at Men-
zies’, when Betty Moffatt became Mrs.
Charles C. Busby. She is a daughter of the
William Moffatts, of Berrambooi, Willaura,
and the bridegroom hails from Westbury, in
the Apple Isle. The bride wore silver lace
over pink georgette, with handkerchief
flounces of white tulle. A train of cloth of
silver was poised upon white tulle, crystal-
fringed, and a veil of the latter, sprinkled
with silver fleur-de-lis, rippled over the
whole, Maids June Moffatt and Joan Robert-
son were also adorned with silver lace, and
their white fluffy raiment was crowned by
tulle head-dresses arranged on Oriental lines.
Mrs. Moffatt welcomed the guests at Men-
zies’ in a black gown relieved by oxidised
silk and bead embroidery and a black hat.
Mrs. Busby was also in black, with enrich-
ment of blue and gold.
The late General Bridges’s youngest girl,
Marion, and Captain Maxwell are booked to
say “I will” in the Penang Cathedral on
the 18th. Antony Bridges, who has a job
in Sumatra, will escort his sister from Singa-
pore, where she is staying with brother
Noel. Girls are scarce in the Malay States,
so there will be none in attendance, but Mrs.
Noel Bridges will be a matron of honor, and
her small son Feter is to be a page. The
bridegroom is a son of the Crawford Max-
wells, of Tasmania. Following the example
of his brother-in-law-elect, Noel Bridges,
Captain Maxwell went in for rubber-growing,
after laying aside his uniform, and the
couple will live on his plantation, 20 miles
outside Singapore.
The principals of a well-known girls’
school, with a couple of women companions,
have registered a mild kick against “plums,
prunes and prisms” and the fetters of con-
vention by going a-camping far from the
haunts of char-h-banc parties. Caravans
can’t be had in Australia, but a sympathetic
greengrocer, for a consideration, parted for
a time with his cart and Dobbin, and the
quartette, armed witli tent, bedding and pro-
visions, set off to explore the fastnesses of
the coast. The weather favored them, and
a farm supplied fruit, milk and butter, with
a fresh chop when killing-day came round.
Riding pants and silk shirts were not only
permissible, but appropriate in such circum-
stances, and there was a delicious guilty
thrill in driving the chariot homewards so
circumspectly that no fond parent nor pert
student had a chance of recognising the
rebels.
Dr. Margaret McLorinan, who is a mem-
ber of the committee and also of the honorary
medical staff of the Queen Victoria Hospital,
has bidden a number of folk to the Lyceum
Club on Saturday afternoon to drink tea
in honor of Dr. Clara Stone, who is going
abroad. The three women doctors of the
Stone family took a leading part in establish-
ing a separate hospital for women and child-
ren, the first meeting with that end in view
being convened by Dr. Clara, with the late
Constance and Mary Page Stone, in 189 b.
The hospital, which now copes with 2000 in-
patients and over 27,000 out-patients in a
year, had its beginning in a three-days-a-week
dispensary, established by these pioneers.
The T. A. Connollys, of East St. Kilda,
are rejoicing in their temporary recovery of
a daughter, Mrs. Weale, who lias been
living the last five years in Constantinople,
where her husband helps to look after the
Eastern Question from the consular office.
Since their marriage in Cairo, some eight
years back, this cosmopolitan couple have
seen life in “the East” from many angles.
They have been householders in both Jeru-
salem and Damascus, and shifted their bag-
gage through Syria and Egypt. It’s no
wonder that the two small sons chatter easily
in strange tongues.
The theory that Captain E. M. Wright is
in charge of T. M. Burke Pty., Ltd., and the
Burke racing interests during the absence
abroad of the head of the family, broached in
this Letter some weeks ago, proves to be not
well founded. Marcus Burke, who is a co-
director with his father, has taken the helm.
This is Muriel Heagney, who knows the
Labor movement in Australia from the in-
side, and lately
has been hav-
ing a look at
the socialist
movement and
labor condi-
tio n s in
Europe. Her
late father sec-
retaried the
A.L.P. from
the time it
was the F.L.C.,
and she glean-
ed from him
and her studies
enough know-
ledge to put
her on the
executive of
the Trades
Hall Council.
She was basic-
wage investi-
gator for the Federated Unions? of Australia,
and has done much arbitration work. After
being secretary for Lady Forster’s appeal for
stricken Europe for a couple of years, she
joined relief organisations working in Ger-
many and Greece, and studied reconstruction
problems in Austria, Poland and Russia.
Concerning Soviet Russia of these later
days, Miss Heagney is frankly enthusiastic.
She found the girls in factories well clothed,
even smart. Luxury was gone, but there
seemed more content. An educational move-
ment was responsible for a boom in theatri-
cal production—every factory had its drama-
tic society and orchestra —for music and
drama are to be Russia’s roads to regenera-
tion. In Moscow Miss Heagney resided in
a hostel kept by Quakers. In England the
traveller saw something of school medical
work, through the Battersea Borough Coun-
cil, and found better organisation and equip-
ment than is provided here.
Hospitals were earnestly discussed oyer
a morning cup of tea at Scott’s, to which
Dr. Malcolm MacEachern, whose steely eye
is probing the healing institutions of the
State, was invited. W. F. Greenwood, chair-
man of the Metropolitan Hospitals’ Associa-
tion, was mother-hen to a clutch of guests
interested in hospital work, some of whom
had voluntary service of 25 years and over
to their credit. Mrs. MacEachern accom-
panied her husband in a black frock with
a hat of the same sable hue, its upturned
brim caught by a brilliant.
The League of Gentlewomen is the name
of a club of a new sort opened by Miss
Shappere, one-time matron at Geelong Gram-
mar School. The lady when on the other
side of the world lately noted a demand
for women and girls of refinement and edu-
cation to give social service on a commercial
basis —to go shopping, arrange parties, even
give lessons in bridge—and the new organ-
isation will strive to supply any such wants
that may exist in this State. The Chaucer
Library, in the Queen’s Walk, houses the
innovation.
An Australian artist who has found popu-
larity in the British Isles writes of dull
times for musical stars in London. The
witchery that flows from the fingers of
Moiseiwitsch only a quarter filled the Albert
Hall, and the liquid notes of Toti dal Monte
couldn’t entice much better patronage. By
the same English mail comes an interesting
remark from a woman lately returned from
a trip abroad, and now back in her home
city of the Big Smoke: “Things look pretty
bad here, and we are expecting worse in
May, when the ‘coal dole’ will come to an
end.” Putting two and two together, it is
not difficult to account for the unusually
large number of musical artists of assured
reputation booked for Australia. America,
too, is so full of stars just now that an over-
flow in this direction is not only possible but
highly probable.
The polo matches this year will be the
excuse for a rather ifiqre elaborate fringe
of social frivols than previously. The cul-
minating blaze of glory will be a ball at St.
Kilda Town Hall, in which the Hunt Clubs
will have a hand, on March 5, the night of
the finals. Tickets at a guinea and a half
ares- to be issued, and the proceeds of the
merry-making, which will be joined in by
the G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven and I/ord
and Lady Stradbroke, will go to the Women’s
Hospital.
The Children’s Convalescent Home at
Hampton has been enriched by a cheque for
£l5O, which is given to buy apparatus for
“artificial sun” treatment of tubercular
limbs and other ailments in the new wing
for boys. The money is the first-night’s tak-
ings of the New Regent Theatre, at Gardiner.
It was handed over by the management of
Associated Theatres, Ltd., to the State Gov-
ernor’s lady to use in any way she pleased
for the benefit of sick children.
Getting her passport in order is Cecil Tait,
a daughter of the Charles Taits, who sets
sail for the Great Smoke in March.
From Adelaide, by way of postscript :
A message from Lady Weigall to open-hearted
Abe Shannon, telling of an Australian wing to be
added to a home for impoverished gentlewomen at
Sunningdale (Eng.) at a cost of £250 a room, drew
from him a prompt cheque, with a suggestion that
the room should be called after Lady Weigall in
tribute to the “tremendous interest she takes in
everything Australian.”
Mary, eldest daughter of the Keith Bowmans, of
Poltalloch, is booked to marry Trefford Cowan, of
Lucindale. Two big clans, both well landed, will
thus be allied.
This freedom in regard to attire gets more so.
The notice of a recent frivol at a seaside suburb
reads; “A flannel dance (dress optional) will be
held”..,.
Myles Formby, this State’s latest Rhodes scholar,
is to go to America with the Oxford and Cambridge
lacrosse team.
There was a great fluttering of ribbons at the
Outer Harbor when the mailboat and the Ulysses
pulled out on the same day with cargoes of some
of the very nicest citizens. The George Cowans took
their two small children with them, and plan to
live on the other side of the world. There are
heavy overseas bookings for February and March,
and it looks as though winter would see our May-
fair in dust-sheets fortified by mothballs.
Renmark is mourning Mrs. S. J. Dridan, who died
after a brief illness early in the week. As an Army
sister she had a fine record of service in Egypt,
India, England and France, and after the” Armis-
tice she put in two more years of work at the
military hospital at Keswick. For a time she was
in charge of the Renmark Hospital, and w’as mar-
ried less than a year ago. She will be badly missed
in the river town.
Items of tennis week have been a Town Hall
tea-party with Mrs. Bruce as hostess, a dinner for
men players only (poor women!), and an evening
at the , Floating Palais under the wing of half a
dozen local women players. Mrs. Bruce had the
bad luck to strike the first hot day we’ve had for
ages for her tea-drinking, but it was too cheerful
a gathering ,to be spoilt by the thermometer, and the
flowers —all, /pink and 'white and cherry-color—
were a dream.
Adelaide City Council has made short work of a
suggestion that all? the south side of North-terrace
eastward from Government House shall be barred
to shops; all the north is already taken up by
University, hospital and other reserves. The idea
comes half a century too late. The former steady
succession of' doctors’ private residences has given
place to offices and consulting-rooms. The bidk of
tlie aldermen held that it was impossible to “stem
the trend of trade.” One of them went as far as
predicting that in the next 100 years the whole of
the city inside the Terraces will be one large shopping
centre.
Adelaide’s Outer Harbor is to have its dreariness
brightened a little. Seven acres there have been
set aside to be used for the recreation of visiting
crews and passengers. Captain Warner, of the
Maloja, lately declared it open. S.A. Government
defrays the cost of reclaiming it itrom sand and
mangrove swamp, a local committee hats spent £lOOO
in preparing it for games, and the bigj shipping firms
have promised at least £lOO a ye.tr towards the
upkeep.
Charles Lester, caterer to S.A. Parliament since
the death of John Hines, and about, to retire after
half a century on the staff, has had. an honor paid
him which recalls the old French picture: “To the
Health of the Cook!” At the recent; farewell dinner
to BaVwell at Parliament House, Duvid Gordon pro-
posed Lester’s health, and it was cltorally announced
that Charles is a jolly good fellow.

Think what a jammed shell means when the game is
flying low and fast. No better time for shooting than
in rain and drizzle. But a soft or swollen shell—and
your sport goes winging by—while your numb fingers
tug at the shell.
Can a shell be waterproof? Put a Black shell into water
for half an hour. That Black shell—any Black shell—
every Black shell—will still chamber fire and eject as
though never touched by wafer. That proof holds good

THE WIFELESS CRICKETERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All womanless you go—a sort of stag
Party, it might be called —with less to drag
Across the world. So shall each cricket bag
Be lighter laden.
But none the less ’twill be each bowler’s aim
To have with other things against his name
In score sheets j at the close of every game,
Many a maiden.
For batsmen there’ll be quantities of traps;
Fine legs -will cut some innings short, perhaps,
And forward ones make many a dashing chap’s
Stay not a long ’un.
Of goo-goo eyes you’ll doubtless get your share,
But googlie balls may be as full of snare,
And when they toss the tempters up, beware!
Watch for the “wrong ’un.”
The fish is hard to catch that nibbling shuns;
And what though sweetness lurks in stolen runs,
Remember they’re as perilous, my sons, t
As stolen kisses. . vg
For once there’ll ,be no missufsS at call .
To glory in your feats with bat and ball—
And in the field may Heaven keep you all
From costly misses i

SPORTING
NOTIONS
After Valicare, with Bst. 51b. on her
back, had won the A.J.C. Adrian Knox Stakes in
lmin. 38scc., and that in a common canter, Sydney
people wondered how much more than w.f.a. she
would get in the Newmarket Handicap. The V.R.C.
adjuster of burdens has given her Bst. 71b., and
already thousands of Randwick punters are saying
it’s all over. Certainly the unbeaten filly has-been
leniently treated compared with the Kelso-trained
four-vear-old. Bairn, who; with three or four undis-
tinguished sprints to her credit, has been given the
same weight (9st. 51b.) as Fuji San, hero of a
Doncaster Handicap and a w.f.a. event, and Red
Gauntlet, winner of many 'races. Manfred has 9st.
41b., but he is an unlikely starter. Top Gallant is
top weight with lOst. 21b. ; then come The Night
Patrol and The Hawk (9st. 131 b.) and-Heroic (9st.
81b.). -Valiard, who won last year with'7st. 81b., is
nicely in with 9st. Lausanne, who was third with
6st. 121 b., has Bst. this time, although he has since
failed “several times when solidly backed, and his
solitary success was in a suburban welter,; and if
Vaals (Bst. 41b.) met Valicare over six furlongs in
Sydney, at a difference of 31b.) it would be 20 to 1
on the latter. On paper, Valiard, Leslie Wallace
(Bst. 61b.) and Brimming (7st. 121 b.) look to have the
best chances of downing Valicare, but the unbeaten
filly will be a red-hot favorite if she reaches the
barrier as well as she was in the Carrington and
the Adrian Knox Stakes.
Dainty Davie, who, after failing badly the first
day, outstayed the opposition in the A.J.C. Anni-
versary Handicap, amidst deafening demands for an
inquiry which the stewards ignored, is not in the
Australian Cup. The weights' fob that long-distance
are headed by Pilliewinkie and Lilypond (.each 9st.
61b.). Spearfelt, who is galloping'well again, has
9st. lib., Frances Tressady Bst. 111 b., Virgin Gold
Bst. 61b., Valwyne Bst. 31b., Pildin (the hurdler)
7st. 81b., Mirthmaker 7st. 51b., -Murray King 7st.
41b., Gungool 7st. 21b., Luddenham and Highlander
7st. and Noggin 6st. 131 b. Luddenham and High-
lander were well forward at the finish of the Anni-
versary Handicap, and the latter jhould be dangerous
if it is not decided to reserve limi. tor the Sydney
Pup. It is a race which suits the lightweights —
since 1906, Tartan’s year, six-stoners have ' won it
thrice and seven-stoners 15 times.
Followers of Hasler. the Sydney jockey,
were on excellent terms with themselves at Canter-
bury Park (N.S.W.) on Saturday. The clever little
apprentice rode Sweet Meg (12 to 1) to victory in
the Park Stakes, Biavon (3’s) in the Juvenile.
Handicap and Westerlys (B’s) in the Canterbury
Park Handicap; then his mount Armillary (B’s)
dpd-heated with Sir Honor (2’s) in the Welter.
Sir Honor’s party demanded another race, and their
enormous gelding, who towered over little Arrnillary,
won the run-off by lengths. He was piloted by
Field, who was also successful on Woodville (s’s)
in the Flying Handicap, and was on the second horse
in two other races. Cave Dweller (6 to 4) and
Boonalla (4’s) were good winners in the divided
Highweight Handicap, and Greendale’s third to
Sir Honor and Armillary suggested that the English
gelding is returning to ithe form he showed a couple
of seasons ago.
♦ * * *
With three of the six events taken by first
favorites and the other winners well backed, punters
enjoyed the Epsom (Vic.) meeting, despite the heat.
Olola, who had been successful in the Maiden Plate
at Moonee Valley the previous Saturday, was a 3-to-l
favorite for the Epsom Handicap, and won well from
consistent Altimeter and Spearer, after leading nearly
all the way. Olola is a four-year-old gelding by
Woorak—Perdita, and if the handicapper is not too
hard on him he should swell A. T." Creswick’s bank
balance again before long. Another promising bit of
stuff is Sea Money, a three-year-old chestnut gelding
by Sea Prince —Hush Money, who was useful in her
day. Favorite at 7 to 2 for the Trial Purse, and
helped at the crisis by Duncan’s- fine horsemanship,
he beat a big field rather impressively.
* * * *
“P.ris”: If a doubles tote is ever established
in Australia, it will pay dividends which will make
the “this-and-the-next” bandits shed tears. At Ascot
(Brisbane) on Foundation Day, a friend of mine
P u ked a winning double—Collessie and Polardee,
£lO to 10s. He was very pleased with himself till
he saw the tote dividends. Collessie paid £l5 16s.
for 10s., with two other divvies (second horse £lO
195.); Polardee, second favorite in a field of six, paid
£1 10s., with a second dividend. On the same basis
of investments, the tote odds for the straightout
double would have been £lO5 to 10s.
» * * *
“Bris”: Brisbane Tattersall’s Club is on
a good wicket. The club held five race meetiirgs
last year; one was spoilt by wet weatner, put the
rest showed big profits. Racing receipts (gates, tote,
bookmaker's’ fees, etc.) totalled £11,530, whereas the
club receipts from members’ subscriptions, bar and
; billiards amounted to £BO7l. On the other haird,
. the club distributed £8049 in prize money. Profits
from the race meetings have helped to build the
club's new premises in Edward-street, which are
expected to dazzle Brisbane sports when they are
opened shortly.
* ■» * *
“Jackeroo”: Joe is an authority on un-
registered racing in Brisbane, and he undertook to
act as my mentor at Kedron Park. His system,
when explained, seemed simple enough; it was to
back the horse .whose rider had been taken off by
the stewards! When we twigged Tractor being led
back to the enclosure, Joe adjured me to “hop
in before the mob wake up.” But the mob seemed
already thoroughly awake to the fact that Tractor
was to have a club jockey (a number of such are
kept in readiness for such emergencies), and the
best I could get was £3 to £2. When I returned
to the stand another moke was seen returning. “Ye’d
better have a saver on Old Dan,” advised Joe. 1
took £6 to £2 about Daniel before repairing to
the bar for a bracer. Suddenly another expert
follower of the game rushed past me, spilling my beer
in his hurry to announce: “Cripes! they’re bringin’
Timothy back —I’m havin’ a quid on him —he's a
cert, if they let his head go.” I went to the tote
and got two tickets on Tim. Boomerang was the
next horse to have his jock taken off him, but my
fiver was all invested by this time. Then came the
race itself. .There were five starters, and Dinkum,
whose jockey hadn’t been changed, waltzed home.
I walked.

It was a surprised and disgusted Ignacio
Fernandez w r ho saev referee Wallis place a hand on
the head of Gavino Deleon, as -well as on his own, at
the conclusion of 20 bitter rounds at the Sydney
Stadium. Ignacio had walloped Gavino so completely
at their first meeting that he made the mistake of
under-rating the enemy. Deleon, for his part* had
realised that boxing off with a scientist such as
Fernandez was bad policy, and he crowded in on
-the stylist continually. All the same, there
was a lot of “sound and fury, signifying nothing,”
about Deleon’s methods; scores of times he simply
smacked the other Manilaman on the elbows and the
broad of the back, while Fernandez sent in real
punches which damaged Gavirio’s features and piled
up the points. Ignacio’s defence was also superior,
but defence is nowadays ignored and the art of
boxing an unconsidered item in the referee’s mathe-
matics. Gavino was down four times altogether, and
he looked settled in the 11th and again in the 14th.
After that, lack of condition told on Fernandez, but
in this writer’s judgment he deserved the decision
he did not get. Weights: Fernandez, Bst. 61b.;
Deleon, Bst. 1011 b.

Another Filipino in Macario Flores (lOst.
had a Saturday-night engagement at the
Melbourne Stadium with Jock Cameron (lOst. 61b.).
The brown man’s reputation had no daunting effect
on Cameron, who, not content with outpointing; the
Filipino, at times stood toe to toe and slugged.
Outboxed and outfought, and at a great ; disadvantage
in reach, the fat little man from the Orient con-
tinued as full of fight as a butcher’s pup to the
end of his terrible drubbing. Cameron must now
be considered a very serious menace to our best
welters.

Surprises tumbled daily into the Austral-
asian tennis tournament at Adelaide, and an echo
of'the local excitement came back in remarks from
America that the U.S. public would like nothing
better than ,to see new champions come from Aus-
tralia in quest of the Davis Cup. First of all, E.
T. Moon, the Queenslander, slashed his way to
victory against Gerald Patterson in the first round
of the singles. Patterson won the first two sets, but
the others were Moon’s: 6 —B, 5—7, 7—5, 6 —4,
6 3. Moon, a forceful, nonchalant player who,
With polishing, is likely to go far, was eliminated
by .the South Australian E. T. Rowe in a five-set
contest, in spite of a brilliant 6-wO win in the first
set. Then J. B. Hawkes vanquished J. O. Anderson,
who earlier in the week had been hard put to it
by Gettimell, the Westralian, Anderson Was bril-
liant at times, but he is not quite the player he
was, and Hawkes, who was never better, won 6 —B,
7 5, 6- —3, 6 —4. Meeting Jim Willard (N.S.W.) in
the find—Willard had previously defeated Schles-
.inger-—Hawkes was again in a scintillating mood
and put Willard through properly: 6—l, 6-—3, 6 —l.
In the final of the doubles Anderson and O’Hara
Wood were no match for Hawkes and Patterson,
who won in straight sets: 6 —l. 6—4, 6 —2. Daphne
Akhurst retained her title in the ladies’ single's,
beating Miss Boyd comfortably, but the Vic. girl
and Mrs. O’Hara Wood accounted for. Miss Akhurst
and Miss Marjorie Cox in a brisk fight for the
doubles. The young Melbourne Chinese player, Lum,
made a good showing during the tourney, which
indicated strongly the passing of,; (he ojd tennis gods.

“Hotham”: The expletives used by skirted
tennis and hockey players have been commented on
in England. Having seen something of feminine
hockey in Melbourne last season, I am inclined to
think that, if lady hockey players don’t swear, it
isn’t for lack of good reason. Lovely woman leans
to all-in methods m all games, and I have watched
with interest female hockey players get in work
in the ruck which would bring tears of envy to the
eye of an All Black wing forward.

After a good deal of cogitation on ways
and means of making Maroubra (N.S.W.) speedway
safe for motocracy, the management has decided to
grade the car-drivers into six classes, labelled
alphabetically from A (o F. To get into A grade
requires proved ability to move at more than 90
m.p.h., while if one has never been fount guilty
of exceeding 50 m.p.h. one can trundle around with
class F boys. To exceed the speed ‘linfit of., one’s
class means automatic promotion to a higher i class.
When racing commenced at Maroubra, this paper
recommended closer classification as a means of
making the racing more interesting, and classifica-
tion has been proceeding ever since with benefit
to the sport. The latest arrangement will become
effective on the 13th, when there will be a five-
mile handicap for private owners in C class—7o
to 80 m.p.h.
“Illex”: It w’as suspected about 30 years ago that
the speed attainable by a cyclist behind pace is
limited only by tne speed of tne pater and the
amount of wind-protection afforded by the pacing
machine. Recent experiments on tracks made for
motor-racing, behind huge and powerful motor-cycles,
strengthen the suspicion. Hubert Opperman, on one
of the lesser Australian speedways, managed to
compass 53£ m.p.h., and on ■ the extremely fast
I reran motordrome at Montlhery recently a speed
of over 76 m.p.h. was maintained for 60 minutes
by the French rider Brunier, who followed an enor-
mous two-wheeler propelled by a 4-cylinder 45-h.p.
engine and broke all the paced records in the world
from half a mile up to one hour. In comparison with
such speeds, unpaced records seem tame. The human
limit seems to be about 40 m.p.h., maintained for
not more than a furlong; the speed at which fin-
paced races are won is not demonstrabl.v faster to-day
than it was 30 years ago, when Arthur Zimmerman’s
flexible ankles won him world-wide fame. i
*** . •
Alan Kippax’s chaneeless 271 n.o. (in
432 minutes), a fine stand by Ponsford (138) and
Woodfull (126) in Victoria’s second innings, and
fast-bowler Everett’s 4 for 57 and 5 for 91 were out-
standing features of the second N.S.W.-Vic. match,
which the Ma State won by an innings and 96:
708 against 290 and 322. In ordinary circumstances,
Kippax's really great innings would have gained him
a trip to England, but the circumstances are not
ordinary, a dozen members of the touring team having
been picked months before there was any need,
and one of the selectors having said that he would
not be guided by. proficiency alone, or words to that
effect. So Kippax has been excluded, along with
Kelleway and Vic Richardson, while inferior men
will go on tour. Arthur Richardson and Woodfull,
who have certainly earned their places, are the
fourteenth and fifteenth men, Ellis is second wicket-
keeper (the general public preferred Love, but there
is little to choose between the two), and Everett
is sixteenth man and second fast bowler. Nobody
begrudges these men their selection, but in the
judgmert of 95 p.c. of the cricketing public, Kelle-
way, Kippax and Vie Richardson should have been
chosen befbre Bardsley, Mailer and Hendry.
THE S.P. MARKET REPORT.
RADIO TRAVELLES (breaking the ice ): “Eli bet when you open that
newspaper you'll look to see what prices arc quoted in the
market
STEVE: “My oath! I 'ad fire bob each way on Periwinkle fr th'
Robbery Park Welter Sattcrdee, an' 'c won by a mile.'”
“Winkle”: For the omission of Kippax there is
no excuse. This youngster has better performances
in the past four seasons than any other Australian
batsman. In 1922-23 (average 98), and this season
(av. 112) he headed the Shield averhges for all
States. Last season (av. 133) only Rock (av. 140)
was in front of him; and in 1923-24 he was on top
for N. S. Wales, only Ponsford, Love and V. Richard-
son beating him on the all-comers’ list. Thus in four
seasons of Shield cricket, Kippax has been the most
prolific Shield rungetter, making 1923 runs in 22
bands; in the same time, Woodfull, who is next,
made 200 less with seven more innings. Away down
in the ruck comes John Ryder. He managed only
699 runs in his 23 attempts.
“Shrewsbury”: The style in which Baring got his
70 in Victoria’s first knock must have, convinced
the onlookers that a great batsman was lo'st to inter-
national cricket when Baring dropped out of the
game after the war. It was a long time since such
beautifullv-placed driving through the covers had been
seen in Sydney. Save for Johnny Taylor and Gregory,
none of the Australian XI cracks exhibit the
Victorian’s old-fashioned tendency to hit the ball
with the bat, when everyone knows that it should
be permitted to trickle off it, reliance being placed
on a misfield to get runs. And 12 fours in an
innings of only 70! Some of our cricket geniuses
don't get so many in a season.
“M.H.”: Three months ago anyone would have
laid 20 to 1 against Sam Everett being picked to
go to England. He wasn’t reckoned good enough for
the Australia v. The Rest match; incidentally, nine
of the 22 who played in that game (Kelleway,
Kippax, Scott. Love, V. Richardson, Rock, Rymill,
Blackie and Hornibrook) were excluded from the 16
for England. Everett’s 9 for 148 for N.S.W. v.
Victoria on a perfect Sydney wicket did the busi-
ness. Also it enabled him to finish the season with
a better record than Gregory, who got 13 wickets
averaging 40.76, or Scott, who bagged 32 at 31.93;
Everett took 25 at 21.64. The youngest member of
the touring team (he has just turned 24), Sam was
playing in a church competition when the Peter-
sham club discovered him. For Petersham in 1921-
22 he headed the season’s grade averages with 33
wickets at 12.21. Last season he took 52 at 14.57.
In Sheffield Shield cricket Everett got 3 for 123
in 1921-22, 6 for 64 in 1922-23, and 6 for 118 in
1923-24 His bowling in the last two matches
on the Sydney' Cricket Ground was very good, but
two swallows don’t make a summer, nor two credit-
able performances a “great” fast bowler; as he has
been styled. He may r prove a worthy substitute
for Gregory'—l hope lie will—but at present troops
of Australians have the impression that if anything
happens to Kangaroo Jack it will be 6 to 4 against
Collins’s trippers winning the Tests.

“Shrewsbury” : In commenting on medico-
cricketers “Mars” (B. 28/'l/’26) states that, though
several have figured in Tests in Australia, none has
accompanied a team to- England. He has overlooked
Dr. J. E. Barrett, the Vic. sfonewaller who accom-
panied Blackham’s team in 1893, and Dr. R.
B. Minnett, who was a member of the 1912 side.

“Siam” : Some of the players in the Q.-S.A.
match were not on the earth when the States last
tried conclusions at Brisbane. Oh that occasion,
January, 189,9, the Wheatfielders included Clem Hill,
George Giffep and Joe Darling, who captained the
team. South Aus. Batted first and made 582
(Darling 210, Giffen 115, Hill 78) and won by an
innings and 284. At one period two left-handers
(Hill and Darling) were batting against two left-
hand bowlers, Byrne and Allan; the partnership
added 141 runs. The Queensland bowler Evans got
five of the 10 S.A. wickets, each with the fifth ball
of an over.
"Past Grammar”:
Though beaten by 44
runs in a played-out
game at Brisbane,
Queensland kept the
powerful South Aus.
batting side quiet; the
Wheatfielders’ scores
were 198 and 200.
Scott, who took 8 for
84 altogether, was the
principal factor in his
side’s success. Time
was when, in abo.
Henry, Timbury and
McLaren, the Northern-
ers could boast some
good fast bowlers, and
they should go hunting
for some more. They
haven't had one for
years. In other re-
spects they were quite
the equals of their
opponents, and there
can no longer be any
reasonable objection to
the State’s admission
to the Sheffield Shield
ring. A serviceable
member of the Queens-
land team was .A. I).
Mayes, the Toowoomba
youngster who for .some
years was one of the
mainstays of Sydney
Uni. club. Last season
he was given a trial
as a bowler for N.S.W.,
and might have de-
veloped into a regular
habitufi of the XI
had he remained in
Sydney. A tall, fast-
medium . right-hander,
he has a smooth and
easy action, and, with
a good length, brings
them fast off the pitch.
In addition, he is a
vigorous batsman and a
fittb slip field. In
South Australia’s sec-
ond knock he got
Pritchard. Alexander,
Vie Richardson and
Parry for 34. and fin-
ished up a useful day
by making 36 himself.
Adelaide club cricket, with six matches
played, is so far a walk-over for Sturt, which, with
the services of Vic Richardson, Scott, Townsend and
Willsmore, is unbeaten. No other club has won more
than half its games. A “colts’ ” team drawn from
all the districts, with Arthur Richardson as captain,
is a bad second, and University a close third. The State
averages for an unusually busy season (eight matches)
go to show that Gun is the best of. the local crowd
of lefthanders. His 55.8 makes him top of the
list, a fraction ahead of Arthur Richardson, who
has, however, by far the biggest aggregate. Alex-
ander is the only other batsman over 50; in fact,
Vic. Richardson (Vic.’s figures were spoiled by an
unaccountable “pair” against Westralia), McKay,
Pritchard and Rymill, who come next, are all below
40. In bowrtng. Wall’s 12 wickets at 13 runs
each against Westralia stands alone; but he played
in no other match, and the main work was done
by Arthur Richardson, 30 at 22, Grimmett 56 at
30, and Scott. 34 at 31.

“Shrewsbury”: The Maoriland Soccer
authorities fifive completed arrangements for the visit
of a side from South Africa. The tourists leave
in June. It is doubtful whether Australia .will get
a glance at them; the M.L. and Aussie associations
have been unfriendly for some time past, and this
feeling was accentuated when the ruling body in
the Dominion, fearing the expense, missed the ’bus
with the English team. South African Soccer is
said to be as good- of its kind as the sub-continent’s
Rugger, and in that case should be a bit above
M I-’s best. The Afrikanders get a fair amount of
visits from good English teams, and have had
much better opportunities of picking up"“the fine
points of this branch of football than our men on
this side.

THE INKY WAY.
Carington Walters, a Melbourne boy, after service
ith the A.1.P., dropped into a contract with a news-
aper syndicate in Krgland to “write up” the East
ndies. Having finished that, he became a planter
id is now taking a holiday in Australia whilst
is rubber-trees grow.
“Ex-Englishman”: Surely “Topee” must be talki-
ng through that head-gear when he claims “wowser”
s a well-known foul expression in Leeds and Birm-
ngham. 1 don’t know anything about the former
/lace; but I was brought up in and around the
litter, and certainly 1 never heard the word till I
ame to Australia.
Novelist H. G. Wells has a short and sharp, not
o say rude and offensive, way of choking off corres-
pondents. One who wished he hadn’t written to
■Veils was Stout, Maoriland’s venerable Chief Justice.
Hu sent a polite little note correcting what he
.onsidered was an error in zoology in the “Outline
if History.” The reply was to the effect that when
Wells wanted any instruction from Stout he would
isk for it.
“Fitzcray”: Melbourne Herald is famous among
its contemporaries for its little lapses, intentional and
otherwise. Recently it published a wire giving an
iccouiit of an alleged volcanic eruption at Twin
Hills (C.Q.), and made Fred Chapman, paleontologist
at Melbourne Museum, assert that the rocks thereabout
were of the “crustacean” period. It may have been
only a coincidence that the local Cray season had
opened earlier in the week.
“Michael Earle” (Vancouver, 8.C.) : The void
“wowser” has developed a new meaning in the
Pacific north-west States. A report from Seattle
records that combined dry squads and sheriffs’ forces
located several barrels of moonshine by using
“wowsers,” bootlegger slang for the old-fashioned
divining-rod. The report states that the “wowser,”
if properly held, never fails to turn down where
liquor is buried. In this case “wowser” seems to be
a corruption of “douser,” the English word for a
water-diviner.
“C.Q.” : Rumor persistently has it that the Argus
will shortly launch an afternoon paper in Melbourne,
although she is alleged to have sworn that she would
never invade the seas now in sole occupation of the
Herald so long aS that evening monopolist refrained
from launching a morning paper. This protocol or
pact, if such was ever made, it is claimed the
Herald broke when it bought the Suk Pictorial,
the healthy little morning sheet whit h the defunct
evening Sun left behind it. It might be protested,
of course, that there is a difference between starting
a new paper and buying an established one, but
the argument looks strained.
“Hotham”: The sudden death of Melbourne Punch,
besides dashing the spirits of Australian freelances
of pen and pencil, has also cast something of a
gloom over its sister publications run by the same
proprietary. When Punch was translated, portion
of its mantle was handed to Table Talk, an unassum-
ing journal in a brick-red cover which enclosed
nothing but “social gossip.” This, of a supervacuous
variety, endeared it to thousands of Melbourne
homes, whose female inhabitants bought it to gloat
over the details of the local butcher’s wedding with
the publican’s daughter. Now, clad in the red, white
and black raiment of the dead. Punch, and with some
of the latter’s adornments in the way of color illustra-
tion and literary features, Table' Talk is out to
hold its old clientele and capture a new one; and
the proposition isn’t easy.
“Fitzcray”: Keith Murdoch, managing editor of
the multifarious Melbourne Herald publications,
leaves on a trip to England next month. His regime
as “chief executive” of the Herald has been an
ambitious one, and some of his schemes have
proved too unwieldy to handle. His conception of
newspaper management is founded on the Northcliffe
myth, somewhat discounted to-day, and the huge
building in Flinders-street is a very fair imitation
of Carmelite House in the time of the “Chief,” him-
self an imitator in methods of the American Gordon
Bennett. The illusion is heightened by a semi-personal
staff of ex-Carmelites who listen to the great man’s
adjurations and broadcast them to lesser lights. With
all his natural ability, Murdoch’s reign at the Herald
has been marred by a fault Which is never seen in
really successful commanders. He cannot refrain
from trying to do everybody else’s work as well as
his own, and results have sometimes been dis-
appointing.
“Avon”: Celebrated its 75th birthday recently, the
Christchurch (M.L.) Lyttelton Times, which claims
to be the oldest newspaper in the Shivery Isles,
beating the Otago Witness, a weekly, for the honor
by a scant four weeks. The Times first appeared on
January 11, 1851, and was printed in a back yard
in Port Lyttelton on a flat-bed machine worked by
man-power, the whole plant having been brought
over by some of the Canterbury “Pilgrims.” It .ran
as a weekly for three years, came out twice a week
for nine years, three times a week for two years and
daily for the rest of the time. Its first editor, James
Edward Fitz Gerald, was also the first Premier ,of
Maoriland; he was also the first editor of the Times’s
hated , rival, the Press, which isistill going strong.
Men live long on the Times staff, and there are to-
day over 32 employees who number more than ,25
years’ service—the oldest has been there for 60
years. Bounded on the east, south and west by
■pubs, the old office in Cathedral-square is the hotne
of. many hectic, memories. When the rag first'came
to Christchurch, in the early ’sixties, there used' to
be a hole in the wall between' the comp-room and
Warner's, through which pints of beer were handed
by. a sympathetic and conscientious barman till the
paper got to press. . ,
“Machete”;■ Of all the ills a wind can blow, the
failure of sub-editors-to return stamped MSS. is the
most unkind.' A sufferer myself, my heart bled the
other day when; relieving another man, 1 carne across
this in a neglected-looking pigeon-hole;!
“The Editor,"
“The Blanketv Blank, Melbourne.
“Dear Sir,—About three months ago 1 forwarded you
an alleged humorous poetical composition called
‘Sunlit Songs’ for your kind consideration, and al.-o
enclosed a stamp, so that in the event of your
regarding it with disfavor you might return the
alleged ; poem. Am now enclosing another stamp,
and shall be much honored and obliged if you will
.communicate in brief, a reply to one of the follow-
ing queries:
A. Can you use ‘Sunlit Songs’ ?
B. Can you return ‘Sunlit Songs’ ?
C. Have you destroyed ‘Sunlit Songs’?
Your kind reply to one of these interrogations will
win you my undying gratitude. Wishing you a happy
and prosperous New Year. Yours faithfully, .”
Search failed to find either the MSS. or the second
stamp. I am hoping against hope that both went
safely bank to this apostle of True Politeness under
Difficulties.
“C.Q.” : In the realm of yellow journalism dog eats
dog voraciously. Recently a rumor gained currency
in Melbourne that an elderly man now waiting his
trial for the murder of a woman at St. liilda was
receiving from a mysterious couple outside the prison
walls practical sympathy in the shape of meals
and other comforts. The sleuths of a Sydney weekly
which specialises in amateur detective work got on
tire scent, and discovered that the two were a wealthy
American and his wife. They were pleasantly satis-
fied with their scoop until a Melbourne rival came
out with the blinding revelation that the lady phil-
anthropist tfas the Perth damsel who a few months
ago shot her lover in the ballroom of Government
House and was acquitted of murder by a sympathetic
jury. She had subsequently met her American mag-
nate in Melbourne; he had fallen in love with her
on the spot, and, undeterred by her account of her
past history, had taken her to the registry office
without delay. The girl’s sympathy with a rrian ill
the same plight as she had been through had moved
her to get in touch with the prisoner and alleviate
his time - of waiting with porterhouse steak and peas;
and her new soul-mate had feadily assisted in the
work of charity. The same paper reported the
couple as now on their way to take the place in
N’York society to which the bridegroom’s wealth and
position entitle him. The Melbourne public then
sat down waiting breathlessly to see hdw the Sydney
weekly would go one better than that.

The Test of Co-operation.
THE manner in which the P. & C. has lived up to
the very spirit of co-operation lias earned for it the
goodwill of the man on the land.
The first Life Office in Australia to adopt the principle
of co-operation, the P. & C. is linked with most influential
co-operative bodies in the Commonwealth.
The P. & C., therefore, is controlled by the man on the
land, in his own interests, and in joining it the Farmer
and Grazier joins his own company and promotes his
interests.
Doubtless this accounts for the unprecedented success of
the company as expressed by five record-breaking years.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Plaintiff said that her husband was employed in
a city orchestra.... He drank heavily.’'—Police-
court report.
I sit in my stall and I squirm
Whilst the heroine whines of her woes,
Or the jests that are old and infirm
Come through the comedian’s nose.
I muse through the screams and the shrieks,
I muse through the serio’s winks:
“There are some must endure this for weeks—
No wonder the orchestra drinks!”
Consider the folk they allege
Are stars; ev’ry mangled old plot;
The jokes that are near to the edge;
The merchants of fun who are not;
The giddy old grandma who barks
Her lines like a giddy young minx—-
With such a collection of narks
No wonder the orchestra drinks.;
When a wearisome artist essays
A chorus from patrons to draw,
To an air that the orchestra plays,\
His impudence sticks in my craw.
Some night I shall shout, I foresee,
Whilst the dud on the stage gapes and blinks:
“Come sing this fine chorus with me—
‘No wonder the orchestra drinks!’”

Audiences have got used to stage remarks
which would have brought furious blushes
to the faces of playgoers of a previous gen-
eration ; and the obstetric conversations of
“The Pelican,” which opened at the Sydney
Royal on Saturday, are accepted as a matter
of course. Even the reason given by Wanda
Heriot for thinking that the father of a
child may have very little influence upon the
youngster’s character —all he has to do in
the matter “seems such a casual thing,” she
says—passes with a mere laugh. Marcus
Heriot, scion of a military family which
lives in an atmosphere of tradition and snob-
bery, makes a war-time marriage with
Wanda, who is left to live with the family.
Presently, fearing that the unhappiness she
feels in an atmosphere that suffocates her
will have an ill effect upon the child that
is to be born, she goes away without leaving
an address. That circumstance, her friend-
ship in'* her loneliness for a man she had
known in their native Canada, and a pro-
longed period of gestation supply grounds
for a divorce, into the seeking of which
Marcus, still doubtful about his wife’s guilt,
is driven by his parents. Wanda helps by
admitting that she loves the Canadian ; she
subsequently explains that, badgered and
hurt, she made that damning admission to
hurt the husband who was hurting her. As
a duty to the child, she offers him the oppor-
tunity of recognising the infant Robin as his
own ; nevertheless, she is overjoyed when the
Heriots disdainfully decline to believe her
assertion that he is really Marcus’s child,
and pursue their intention of taking such
steps at law that he will have no claim to the
Heriot estates. Happy in the possession of
the boy, Wanda finds prospects of a new
happiness in the devotion of her employer,
Paul Lauzan ; but Robin, as he grows to
manhood, shows distinct Heriot character-
istics, especially in his leanings towards a
military career; and, brought into touch with
his father, he is recognised as living
evidence that the legal proceedings amounted
to a great wrong. For the problem created
by this discovery a more satisfactory solution
than the sacrifice of both Wanda and her
lover might have been found ; but the picture
of a devoted mother lacerating her bosom for
her offspring had to be worked out. Just
as inartistic happy endings are dragged into
some plays, so unhappy endings quite as un-
convincing are forced upon others.
* * * * *
The emotional Wanda supplied a part
which suited Mary Hinton far better than
the proud, reserved Lady Mary in “Beau-
caire”; but, although the quietness of her
methods was in places effective, she failed to
lift some of the situations, and the
touch of amateurism is still there. The
stage direction seemed at fault, too;
Wanda’s last dramatic speech in Act I should
have been made near the door instead of
from a distance, necessitating a gradual exit
which spoilt the effect. As a oi.ni~t>acii~u
General Heriot, and later a paralytic wreck,
Mayne Linton did very good work (this
was the part in which in the Melbourne pro-
duction Arthur Styan made his last appear-
ance) ; as Marcus, Frank Harvey was a
convincing soldier who is rather stupid in
his love-affairs ; Roland Ward was effective
as the youthful Robin; Kenneth Brampton
put sympathy into the part of Clieriton, the
lawyer and family friend; Harvey Adams
made only half a success of Paul Lauzan,
Wanda’s employer and lover; and MrS.
Robert Brough supplied a lifelike charac-
terisation, as Lady Heriot, of the cattish
snob, quite sufficient to explain Wanda’s de-
sire to get away from the home that had
been housing them both.

The ghosts of the old memories that haunt
the Sydney Tivoli were stirred when Ye Oide
Minstrel Show made its appearance on Mon-
day. With Will Whitburn at one end and
Charlie Pope at the other, a new generation
was given a good introduction to the variety
show of the past. Whitburn and Pope were
really the only two old-timers, unless Reg
Roberts, who was interlocutor, can be put
in the class; but the melodious “Big Four”
were well in the picture with blackened faces,
and burnt cork had been put to good use on
Quintrell’s band of syncopaters —a purely
Australian crowd who serve up jazz and real
melody, and do it as well as any imported
combination this Showman has heard. Ella
Shields, who re-appeared in the second half
on Monday night, had to ask the usual voci-
ferous audience to let. her off extra numb'rs
—the train journey from Melbourne had left
her tired.

Jim Gerald brought all the usual in-
gredients of revue back to Fullers’ Sydney
theatre last Saturday, when “The Troubles
of Hector” provided a packed audience with
plentiful laughter. The company has weak
joints, but the frivolity it supplies does not
call for great strength, and Gerald is him-
self a whole packet of crackers. There were
dry patches about the “Old Minstrels.” too
but most of the ancients are worth hearing.
The awards in the N.S.W. Band Associa-
tion’s contests were made after the blare of
brass had kept Sydney Sports Ground awake
for over a week. Generally band standards
iu N.S.W. have slipped back, and the only

organ-like sonority in its playing, and won
the A-Grade contest by one point from the
Leichhardt District Band. The latter, how-
ever, secured the first place owing to the
disqualification of Ipswich, which, owing to
the illness of two of its members, had put in
two substitutes and had omitted to apply
for formal permission to play them. The
disqualification, in the circumstances, seems
harsh, and is likely to keep other States
bands away. One of the features of the
contest was some lively playing by the West-
mead Boys, who won the quick-step com-
petition.

A touch of Grand Guignol ends “He Who
Gets Slapped,” chief bill of Sydney Lyceum
this week, and a first-class fiim in spite of
its melodrama. Having foiled a noble patron
who robbed his brains and deprived him of
his interest in life, a scientist, who has drifted
into a job as circus clown with the bill title
of “He Who Gets Slapped,” staggers info
the ring with the idea of exposing the vil-

lain ; but, according to custom, he is struck
in the face each time he tries to speak, and
lies amid the hilarious laughter of the audi-
ence. The satire is linked with "The Re-
creation of Brian Kent” and the usual
Lyceum incidentals to make an excellent pro-
gramme. Hoyt’s presents some good comedy
in "Marry Me,” in which a joking youug
woman, called away, suddenly, leaves a mes-
sage written on an egg for the John Smith
she has arranged to marry next day, telling
him that the wedding is postponed a month.
A lot of fun is hatched from that egg when,
instead of being delivered to the right John
Smith for breakfast, it goes into cold stor-
age to fall, two years later, into the hands
of a dyspeptic John Smith who, to avenge
his stomach, is seeking evidence for food
prosecutions. “Lazybones,” a story of the
“Lightnin’ ” variety, completes a programme
of easy laughs. “Scaramouche” continues to
draw crowds to the Prince Edward.

Madge White has mercifully ceased taking
that nightly bath at the Palace, Melbourne.
In place of this sketch and some other rather
shopworn items, three or four new fancies
have arrived from TJ.S.A. to keep “The Music
Box” in ammunition. Also, the scenery
seems to have paid a visit to the drycleaner’s,
with good results. Harry Angers, as a wow-
ser, makes his humor far too obvious, and
the spectrum analysis of Madge White re-
veals few of the constituents of a star. Never-
theless the play remains good entertainment,
and Edna Saunderson (who combines a flam-
ing yellow shingle with dusky eyebrows'),

On Saturday patrons of Melbourne Tivoli
bade a regretful farewell to Will Whitburn

English comedienne 1 seven Hutch acrobats
who contradict the popular delusion that all
Hollanders see their feet for the last time
about the age of 21; and the Hell’s Bells
Jazz Band in the latest syncopated savag-
eries. If the last-mentioned got their inspira-
tion from the orchestra of Hades, then the
Devil has a poor ear for music. The Four

sporting Venus” combines comedy and the
Scenery oL:Biarritz, Paris and Bonnie Scot-
land with moderate success. At Hoyt’s
Gloria Swanson is in full sail for “The Coast
of Folly,” a perfectly apt term for Palm
Beach, Florida, where the scenes are laid.

Last week the five Veterans of Variety
lightly carried the burden of their 300-odd
years from the field of a successful season
at Melbourne Bijou. One admirer will have
cause to remember them. Implored by the
performers in the usual way to join in the
choruses, he responded with a will, and his
inability to leave off earned the puzzled man
a fine of £3 from an unimpressionable beak.
The Veterans have been replaced by a crowd
of more ordinary moderns. Lily Denville
sets up a ululation described on the pro-
gramme as a song, while Mile. Odette De
Lage draws good music from a fiddle; but
her jazzing while she does it inspires no
enthusiasm. One Swift shows that music-of-
a-sort can be extracted even from a motor-
horn. Occasional laughs lurk in the sketch
provided by Edwards and Hughes, and Gayle
Wyer brings out of his bottomless bag an-
other robustious revue entitled “Oh, You
Wonderful Girl !” over which the sweating
operator in the dome and the manipulator of
the foots do their best to throw sentimental
atmosphere.
** * *
The old “Lion and Mouse” at Adelaide
Royal gives Guy Hastings a big chance in
the Julius Knight part, and he scores heavily,
as does Nellie Bramley in the defiant scenes.
The season is to go on indefinitely. At the
Garden Theatre George Gee has revived the
humorous-torture scene from “Kid Boots,”
and Filippini gives a dashing rendering of
things that range from grand opera to the
“Funiculi” street-song of Naples. West’s
has Jack London’s powerful dog-drama;
Wondergraph, the train-farce, “Excuse Me”;
the York, a gloomy study of Corinne Griffith
getting “declassed.” The Majestic has handed
itself over to a Midnight Frolics co., which
provides the whole programme. Ivanoff
handles a hefty fiddle, and Clem Dawe is
really funny.

From a critic in exile:—
The Commonwealth’s show at the Dunedin (M.L.)
Exhibition is one of the most practical of them all
and not the least attractive. You reach it after pass-
ing through the Canadian court, and the gloom
produced by the black and gold funeral-parlor aspect
of the 150,000-dollar effort of our North American
brethren is dissipated by the sign of the Rising Sun
lighting up the word “Australia” on a solid archway.
Right through the court there is the same welcoming
touch. One slogan says: “Australia —New Zealand:
We’re neighbors;. ' let’s get together.” Another:
“Hands across the Tasman —We can deliver the goods;
let's deliver to each other.” A third: “Anzac means
Australia and New Zealand. If you can’t buy the
goods in New Zealand buy them from Australia.”
The exhibits are not buried amongst a mass of inessen-
tials, as is the case in some other courts; steel
products or canned fruits, wool or corsets, timber or
footwear, minerals or eucalyptus, the visitor can
see them all. Unfortunately the State Governments
can hardly be said to have risen to the occasion;
and some of them missed the ’bus altogether.
Queensland has a compact little exhibit of its
principal products, and the Dunedin sparrows, con-
noisseurs to a bird, have unanimously decided that
Darling Downs barley is the best ever. As a conse-
quence, the Queensland rep. in charge spends a good
deal of his time cleaning his pineapple cans and
trying to make his “bobbed” sheaves presentable.
Victoria has a fairly striking show of fruits, jams,
maize products and timber, but New South is repre-
sented only by a series of pictures of its scenic
beauty—artistic examples of photography, but wholly
inadequate as the parent State’s total contribution.
W.A. and Tassy have nothing at all. None the less,
the Gommonwealth Commissioner has managed, with
the aid’ of exhibits by private business concerns, to
put Australia on the map at Logan Park. But
something more is wanted; for, while Canada and
the U.S. have trade reps, in M.L. and M.L. lias two
in Australia, the Commonwealth has none in the
Dominion.

WE DELIBERATELY pass
over a large proportion
of the readers of “The
Bulletin” in order to address
this page directly to men in their
thirties.
There is a powerful reason for
this.
The dissatisfied man of twenty-
five is not usually in a difficult
position. He has few responsi-
bilities; he can move easily; he
can take a chance.
But from thirty-five to forty is
the age of crisis. In these years a
man either marks out the course
which leads to definite advance-
ment or settles into permanent
unhappiness. There are thou-
sands who see the years passing
with a feeling close to despera-
tion.
They say
“I must make more money,’*
but they have no plan for
making more.
“There is no future for me,”
but they see no other open-
ing.
“I am managing to scrape
along now, but how in the
world will I ever educate
my children?”
To men whose minds are con-
stantly—a n d often almost
hopelessly—at work on such
thoughts, this page is addressed.
It is devoid of rhetoric. It is
plain, blunt common sense.
Let us get one thing straight
at the very start —
We do not want you unless
you want us.
There is the dissatisfied man
who will do something, and the
one who won’t. We feel sorry
for the latter, but we cannot
afford to enrol him. We have a
reputation for training men who
—as a result of our training—
earn large salaries and hold re-
sponsible positions. That repu-
tation must be maintained. We
can do much, but we cannot
make a man succeed who will
not help himself. So rest
assured you will not be unduly
urged into anything.
We attach a coupon to this advertisement.
It is a little thing, but our experience proves
that it separates out of every hundred
readers the few who can act. If you are
one of these let us mail you that wonderful
little book, “Forging Ahead in Business.”
For thousands it has turned dissatisfaction
into immediate progress.

“The TiVoli announces that one of its artists is

No more the showman rests content
With base untutored hinds;
The very latest turns are meant
To cultivate our minds.
The comic man who does not know
The classics now is off;
And every pro’s a better pro
Who might have been a prof.
There’s nought can beat the Oxford bleat
For clowns who fun compel;

Instead of bounding on the stage,
Arrives there by degrees.

“John’s Wood” (Lond.) : The most in-
teresting event in recent stage-life across the
Channel is the presentation at the Theatre
Edouard Sept of “Mozart,” by Sacha Guitry,
whose great gifts as actor and success as
author and producer have made him the most
popular figure in the Parisian dramatic
world. At the beautiful little theatre which
he directs the chief feminine roles are always
allotted to his clever and attractive wife,
Yvonne Printemps. Guitry has chosen for
his latest play the period when Mozart as
a youth of 20 went to Paris, and it is en-
hanced by some admirable songs by Reynaldo
Hahn, which Yvonne Printemps as Mozart
sings with grace. Ballet and other music by
Mozart is effectively introduced. Guitry him-
self played Baron Grimm, and he and his
wife had a remarkable success. This form
of play has recently been very popular. Fol-
lowing “Lilac Time,” dealing with the life
of Schubert, and “Paganini,” treating of the
great violinist’s adventures, George Clutsam,
the Australian, has now completed “The
Damask Rose,” which gives the life-story of
Chopin with appropriate music. Clutsam
had a lot to do with the musical setting of
“Lilac Time,” and is reaping a rich reward.
. “Ancient Prompter”: It is a long time
since Teddy Royce, whose death in England
was chronicled the other day, appeared on
Australian stages, but there are still many
old-timers who remember with affection the
quaint little comedian’s cackling laugh and
all-round “character” ability. He was a
superb dancer withal, and, with Edward
Terry, Nellie Farren and Kate Vaughan,
helped to make the fortune of London’s
Gaiety Theatre in its never-to-be-forgotten
burlesque days. The family connection with
Australia is being kept up by a grandson
of the same name who recently arrived from
England to stage-manage some important
J. C. Williamson productions.
“Bon”: Died recently in England Grace
Warner, daughter of Charles, famed for his
Coupeau in “Drink,” who many a year ago
included Australia in a round-tlic-world tour.
Grace, then a young girl in her ’teens,
appeared here as Juliet to her father’s
Romeo—an unusual casting of the characters
much commented on at the time. 11. B.
Warner, well known on American films, is a
brother.
“R.K.D.N.”: “White Cargo,” which its
author describes as a “drama of the primi-
tive,” is due to open in Sydney soon. It
has had an extraordinary vogue in England
and America, and was recently put on at
the Raimund Theatre, Vienna. But appa-
rently the problem of white folk in the tropics
does not greatly appeal to the Austrian play-
goer; anyhow, the marriage of the white
leading man to the West African bush-girl
seemed nothing out of the ordinary to the
Viennese and not in the least reprehensible.
So the point and the moral of the play
missed.
“Mayne Stay”: “Caesar's Ghost” (B.
28/l/’26) may be right in saying that cos-
tume drama is more popular nowadays with
the male than the female, but it didn’t look
like it the night I went to “Monsieur Beau-
caire.” I also viewed that masterpiece from
the roof —not; a good angle, as we missed all
the action on the stairs—and the number
of shingled and bobbed goddesses was aston-
ishing. Including the usher anil the ice-cream
boy, there were just 20 males in a full gal-
lery. I counted ’em.
“Derwent”: Musician Bradshaw Major,
who for about a quarter of a century before
the war was the premier teacher and church
organist in Hobart, and who with his young
son Frank joined up with the A.1.F., is now
musical director to the Allan Wilkie co. In
Townsville (Q.) recently he wrote from
memory at a day’s notice the incidental music
for “The Bells,” the railway officials having
let the score go astray with other luggage.
R. O. Blackman writes:—
Apropos of Walter Baker’s par. (B. 21/l/’26) about
my plays—he has read them all—l owe the J.C.W.
firm thanks for its interest in my writings. In
January, 1918, J. and N. Tait accepted a play of
mine, “The Eleventh Commandment,’’ a satire on the
medical profession. The exposition was to be in
the hands of the “Turn to the Right’’ co., then
playing “The New Henrietta” at the Sydney Palace.
I still have the letter of acceptance; in fact, I
have embalmed it. We had come to terms, when
the sudden announcement by cable from E. J. Tait
that the entire Booth Theatre co., N. York, had
been engaged to play “The Masquerader” here and
was already on the way, destroyed the season that
my play was to have had. Sara Allgood and her
co. played “Peg” pending the arrival of the other
co., which was headed by Guy Bates Post and Miss
Thais Lawton, and matters were postponed between
myself and the Taits until I took a trip to the
U.S.A. in August, 1918. Mr. Ward (then “the
Firm”) gave me an introduction to J. C. Williamson’s
agents at New Y ork, stating that his people “took
a special interest” in my career. Presently I came
in contact with Oliver Morosco, second only to the
great Belasco as a producer, and I had just reached
that stage where terms were being discussed when
the plague broke out. Anybody who was in N. York
then knows what happened to the theatres and
their managers. The pestilence destroyed my pros-
pects, as I had only a limited time to stay. But
1 remain optimistic still. You have referred to me
as a “Pinero enthusiast.” Perhaps a recent letter
from Pinero (he encloses a private copy of a sketch
called “A Seat in the Park” and has been good
enough to confide to me the title of his new play)
justifies my optimism. It certainly encourages me
greatly.
“Really”: Re circus elephants on strike.
I remember a different incident. A circus
was showing at a
small Vic. wayside
township. It had
arrived by special
train, and by the
time the station
staff had finished
shunting the circus
tent was being
erected over a mile
away. Then the
engine of the circus
train stuck on the
turn-table and
would not budge,
so the guard was
despatched to the
town to borrow an
elephant. Its
keeper was too busy
to accompany the
animal, but told
the guard what
words to say to
start and stop it.
The start was good
and the elephant
easily shifted the
turn-t able. The
guard, however, had
forgotten the stop
word, and the ele-
phant kept on shov-
ing till the engine
looked like a new
variety of merry-
go-round. For 20
minutes they tried
to stop the animal,
and then the guard
trudged to the
town again. When
he returned with
the keeper the ele-
phant was still
shoving, and two
trains had been
SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A HELP AT ALL.
THE OLD PAINTER: “For goodness sake, sit more naturally, and
stop fidgeting, Miss Botticelli —you ought to he able to hold
an easy pose like that for half an hour!”
THE NEW MODEL : “I think I could do much better without the
drawing-inn you sat me on.”
blocked for half an hour.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The proprietor of our
company had advanced notions. He carried
with the show an artist whose job it
was to put local color into the scenery ; the
proprietor got a return for the expense, with
interest, by charging advertising rates to
local business people whose shop-fronts were
represented in front cloths representing
street scenes and the like. The audiences
generally approved the idea. At one town
Casey, of Casey’s Hotel, was so intrigued
at the opportunity of getting ahead of the
other publicans that he agreed to pay a
handsome sum (though a frugal Casey as a
rule) for the conversion of the quiet English
country inn—a “set piece”—into a colorable
imitation of Casey’s Hotel, sign and all. But
it wasn’t wholly a success. Three of the
characters in the drama entered the stage
pub and reappeared shortly in a drunken
condition. “Cripes !” interjected a voice from
the audience. "Nobody ever got tight at
Casey’s in 10 minutes.”
“Goldilocks”: A show which had struck
trouble was working its way to a Maoriland
town where a season on terms, with local
people in charge of the arrangements, pro-
mised a financial lift. But, when almost in
sight of its destination, the company stranded
totally; it found itself without the where-
withal even to shift its baggage for the re-
maining distance, short as it was. A member
of the company who had been fraternising
with some of the market-gardeners of the
neighborhood showed an initiative which
saved the situation, and in the early hours of
the morning the barnstormers crept into
town spread over a caravan of vegetable-
carts. A good first night rewarded their
tribulations. But the manager felt some
embarrassment when he heard a market-
gardener boasting loudly in the theatre lobby
during an interval that the mummers were
friends of his. A sceptic questioned whether
he knew them. “Know ’em?” he shouted.
“Why, I brought some of ’em in with the
cabbages this mornin’!”
“C. Coral”: Murray Islanders had some
new “plays” at their Christmas festivities
this year. One was a very realistic repre-
sentation of a hold-up by bushrangers
(wooden revolvers and all), with soldiers
arriving on the scene in full force and, after
a stand-up fight, hauling the miscreants off
to prison. The spectacular display, per-
formed under the cocoanut palms, earned
loud applause from the onlookers. I asked
about the fertile brain that conceived the
plot and worked out the stage effects. “Oh,
one boy he catch him along pikisurs Thurs-
day Island; he tink that one he good for
play when he come home!” Which makes
one wonder which thriller we shall be seeing
next set to native music. Anyway, it doubt-
less helps to make up for some of the lost
excitement of the headhunting of the past.
“Middle Blue”: “Kangaroo Flat” is not
the first play Tal Ordell has written, pro-
duced and acted in. His first went up in
Brisbane some years ago, with Gus Neville
as the lead and Tal in a humorous part. I have
forgotten the title, and I daresay the author,
who is a modest chap, has forgotten it liim-
self. He has always been a comedian; hence
the good comedy in his latest play. He was
with C. E. King for two or three years in
Brisbane, but audiences would never take
lam seriously if he came out of comedy.
Shrieks of laughter greeted his attempts to
play a serious young man in “Camille.” The
same thing befell Walter Cornock when he
tried to play the sad musician in “Trilby.”
There was boisterous laughter at Cornock’s
first entrance, and his appearance in a grey
wig towards the end of the show was the
signal for yells of delight. Brisbane knew
he was funny when he had whitened his curly
brown hair.
“Flaming Youth”: Dave Meekin, now in
vaudeville, boxed with the late Les Darcy,
and helped to inti’oduce the more or less
noble art into the Philippines. When he
left the ring, or the ring left him, he got a
job in a circus, and, deciding that he must
specialise, chummed up with the lions and
later with a couple of tigers. “Afrikander’s
Lions and Tigers” are the result. They
are obliging beasts, and roar much more
realistically than most performing animals
of the same species. The performing wild
animal always reminds me of the /dd prop-
maker at Drury-lane Theatre wheii R. B.
Sheridan owned it. A rival house had intro-
duced a live elephant, and Sheridan jokinglv
told the old retainer that the innovation was
a knock to Drury-lane. “Bah! Inartistic,
I call it!” snorted the old property-maker.
“I could make a much real-er elephant than
that one!”
“Hamfat”: George Titheradge once said
that he regarded three months’ work during
the year as not at all bad; and, although
times have improved since then, the inter-
vals between engagements still make actors’
salaries much less good than they look on
paper. But there are a few who are speci-
ally fortunate. The useful Herbert Leigh
(B. 21/l/’26) has seldom been out of an
engagement since he came to Australia from
Africa (where for a long time he had his
own company) a quarter of a century ago.
Ilis first appearance in Sydney was with the
Woods-Williamson company at the Criterion.
The co. had been in quarantine during Syd-
ney’s first plague experience, which epidemic
was fatal to actresses Sallie Booth and Ada
Lee. They both were members of the
Willoughby-Geach co., which was to have
opened at the Cri. with “The Wrong Mr.
Wright,” but didn’t, although a Sydney
weekly gave a full and particular notice of
the performance that wasn’t.
“A.G.M.” (London) : Gladys Cooper's
popularity has rested on her great beauty,
her personal charm and her reputation as a
luck-bringer rather than on any discovered
dramatic talent. But quite lately she has
shown unsuspected gifts of vision, and has
won to her side several of the highbrows.
On Sunday, December 13, she took a fresh
step when she appeared at the Princes
Theatre in “L’Ecole des Cocottes,” a play by
Armont and Gerbidon, adapted by H. M.
Harwood. The Censor had refused to license
it for public production, so it had to be given
at a “private” performance. In it Miss
Cooper exhibited subtle skill in a character
recalling the heroines of “La Dame aux
Camellias” and “The Second Mrs. Tan-
queray,” and the connoisseurs wall hence-
forth put a different ticket on her.
“White Way”: “The Man with a Load of
Mischief,” after an auspicious opening in
New York, suddenly flattened out without en-
suring for the producer the regulation number
of performances necessary to establish his
claim to the American rights. And Robert
Loraine was in the cast, too ! The rights
now revert to the author, Ashley Dukes, the
London critic who came to America for the
production, and who has now determined to
bring it across the Atlantic for a second
trial, but with the entire cast from the Hay-
market Theatre, London, where it has had
a highly successful run. No one denies the
literary grace of this play, but many assert
that the almost feverish enthusiasm of the
London critics was not unconnected with
their desire to give every possible inch of
praise to their fellow-craftsman. And there
are others who wonder why many more deli-
cate plays have received the attention of
the Censor, while this lewd adventure has
not evoked a breath.
“Nero” : Robert Courtneidge has installed
wireless and a loud-speaker in the London
Savoy. This is not a movement for the
abolition of the orchestra, which plays as
usual, but an endeavor to do away with
waiting queues at the gallery-entrance. The
“gods” are now allowed to enter the theatre
an hour before the curtain rises, and during
the long wait they are entertained with a
radio programme; the loud-speaker is fixed
in the roof. Which Australian theatre will
be the first to try the innovation?
“Lond” : “Carados” Newton, who is writ-
ing his theatrical reminiscences for London
Referee, devotes a chapter to Jewish per-
formers, and mentions a lot of well-known
names not always recognised as belonging
to the Chosen Race. They include the Lauri
family (originally Lowe), Joseph Coyne
(formerly Cohen), Ethel Levey, the Espin-
osa family, the D’Aubans and notably “Harry
Rickards (privately named Benjamin
Fuller), who, after being a comic singer on
his own, and a ditto duettist with a popular
singer named Carrie Tudor, suddenly emi-
grated to Australia, where he founded the
vast circuit which so long bore his name.”
“Privately named Benjamin Fuller” is great.
“St. John’s” (Lond.) : Kenneth Barnes,
brother of Irene Vanbrugh, is to marry
Daphne Graham, daughter of the beautiful
Lady Cynthia Graham. Mr. Barnes is Prin-
cipal of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art,
and his fiancee, who w 7 as a dramatic stu-
dent, is now an understudy at the Hay-
market Theatre, where “The Man w r ith a
Load of Mischief” is bringing £250 a week
to its lucky author, Ashley Dukes, the critic.
The strain of the leading part in “The Man
with a Load of Mischief” for several months
and doing film work as well has been too
much for Fay Compton, who has gone to
America for a rest. Her role is now taken
by Isabel Jeans, who is a little artificial at
times.

Do you realise that you can
buy a genuine ‘Valet’ razor
aetfor 0(g?
You’ve heard of the *'Valet” razor as the finest razor
in the world. Its feature of keeping the blades sharp
has placed it in a category apart from all others. But
the price may have bothered you.
Well, here’s the “Valet” razor in reach of everyone for
3/6. Not the same razor, of course, in all its fine embel-
lishments, but exactly the same principle—the same
superfine blades—the same self-stropping device, with
strop included—guaranteed to give as good a shave as
the more expensive model.
BRITISH MADE.
OF ALL DEALERS.
This is the New Three and Sixpenny Set
Containing the essentials for a perfect

Blade and Strop in a neat case. If
your dealer does not stock it, the
Agents will send it post
free on receipt of a
postal note for 3/6.

BY APPOINTMENT TO
B R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES
2Stk Nov., 1925.
Messrs. Cvossley Motors (Aust.), Ltd.,
87 William Street,
Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —
I have been driving my “Crosslcy” Car, 15/30 H.P.,
for 12 months, and have covered 10,000 miles on all
classes of roads.
During that time I have travelled through South
Australia, New South Wales and Victoria on private
and official business, and up till now I have not had
occasion to take a tool out of the case nor been held
up through engine or tyre trouble.
It will interest you to know that on the South
Australian trip I covered 1500 miles, carefully check-
ing and measuring the petrol, and I averaged for the
total distance 29 miles to the gallon; on one section,
from Melbourne to Hamilton, 200 miles, I averaged
32 miles per gallon.
I have only just arrived from Melbourne, and I feel
sure you will be pleased to know we had no trouble of
any sort, and the engine is still running beautifully.
Yours faithfully,
H. W. JAMES,
President of the National Roads Association,
Melbourne.
2nd Dec., 1925.
Messrs. Crossley Motors (Aust.), Ltd.,
87 William Street,
Sydney,
Dear Sirs, —
It gives me pleasure to subscribe to the general
efficiency and all-round dependability of the 15/30
II.P. “Crossley.”
As you know, it is 15 months since this firm first
purchased a “Crossley” Car, and it was not until this
car had been on, the.road continuously for 12 months
that we had it overhauled.
There were no mechanical defects, and it was the
condition of this ear that decided us to standardise
on Crossleys throughout.
The new model appears to be even superior to last
+year’s, and if we .get the same service from the new
cars that we obtained from the old one we shall be
very satisfied.
Yours faithfully,
ARTHUR RICKARD & CO., LTD.,
Rickard House,
84 Pitt Street, Sydney.
3rd Dec., 1925.
Messrs. Crossley Motors (Aust.), Ltd.,
87 William Street,
Sydney,
Dear Sirs, —
1 have pleasure in giving you my experience of our
15/30 H.P. Model “Crossley” Car.
I find after two years’ daily use, during which period
I have covered a distance of slightly over 30,000 miles,
that the car is just as good as when first purchased.
During the period mentioned repairs have been prac-
tically nil.
Four other cars I have had during the past ten
years after about the same running distance were
worn out and disposed of.
Re mileage. I recently tested the car with 24 gal-
lons petrol, and covered a distance, city and suburban
running, averaging about 50 stops daily, of 756 miles,
31 1-5 miles per gallon. One country run to Braid-
wood and the South Coast, 34 miles per gallon. This
is ordinary driving, without any special attention. I
consider it remarkable for a car of its size. A test
of this kind is, in my mind, the only one of any
benefit to the ordinary user.
Anyone needing a reliable and comfortable car, with
plenty of speeds economical as to petrol and tyres and
repairs, will find your 15/30 much cheaper, in spits
of the slightly greater first cost, than most of the much-
boosted cheaper cars on the Australian market; at
any rate, such is my experience—in short, I consider
the car worthy of the reputation of the world-famed
Crossley Firm. Yours faithfully,
ERNEST HILL,
Dayton Scale Company City Representative.
Can you imagine better proof of absolute reliability and economy? When choosing your next Car do not forget these facts, and remember that

Studebaker Popularity is World Wide
Studebaker
Standard Six Duplex -
Phaeton * £450
This is the most powerful
car in the world of its weight
and size —a splendid example
of the advantages gained by
One-Profit, Unit-Built manu-
facture. Only the finest ma-
terials are used in it—steel
of special toughness; genuine
leather upholstery. The Du-
plex hood, an exclusive Stude-
baker feature, gives the free-
dom of an open car with the
protection afforded by an en-
closed car. The change is
made in 30 seconds by simply
lowering roller side enclos-
ures. Before you buy see
what Studebaker offers.
Export sales of One-Profit Studebakers in 1925 ex-
ceeded 1924 by more than fifty per cent. And 1924
was the record export year in Studebaker’s history.
The dependability, durability, economy of opera-
tion and riding comfort of Studebaker cars have
made them popular throughout the world.
Only Studebaker in the fine car field and Ford in the
low price field have the vast resources necessary to
make all their engines, bodies, steering gears,
clutches, gearboxes, differentials, springs, axles, grey
iron castings and drop forgings. Extra profits which
others pay to outside parts and body makers are thus
eliminated and these savings are returned to the
product in better materials and finer workmanship.
Designed, engineered and built under one supervision,
the hundreds of parts used in a Studebaker car func-
tion together as a unit resulting in longer life, great-
er riding comfort and higher resale value.
Studebaker makes no spectacular announcements of
“New Yearly Models” to make cars artificially obso-
lete. Resale values are thus stabilized.

round of drudgery. Science and invention have com-
bined in the development of electric household appli-
ances that make tiresome tasks easy. In this work, the
International General Electric Company has played a
leading part Through its widespread organization, cov-
ering every country in the world, millions upon millions
of homes have been equipped with labor-saving electrical
devices.
Back-breaking labor is no longer necessary in household

At the time of writing this
Mine Life is not a life of bliss.
In fact, I feel so dreadfully . ill
That scarcely can I guide urine Quill.
I seem 'to feel, i’ fh’ throat, two lumps;
Also I’m weary and down i’ th’ dumps.
As you may suppose I’iiT feeling hollow;
For naturally, it hurts to swallow.
And living on a diet of gruel,
You can quite imagine, is simply cruel.
My temperature’s high and ascending by jumps:
And mjne heart how it pulsates and bumps and
thumps.
But, of course, I don’t believe in shirking;
Potential Immortals must e’er be working,
\nd I will strive onward and upward, lest any
Should infer that I’ll fail tp fulfil mine Destiny.
And I hate a fellow who groans and grumps,
For we all must bear such burdens and bumps.
W.E.B.: Better than usual, but not much in
our 1ine....A.R.K.: You ask if it is worth 6d. In

duced at a shilling a gross if any market existed

Horrible collection of tortured commonplaces....

“Gerphlin”: Orange (N.S.W.) takes no
back seat to Melbourne in the matter of
eccentric house nomenclature. Owners of
bungalows in the Canoblas burg have taken
to calling their gunyah after members of
the family, one swank domicile being mon-
nibered “Lizlourene” after the three daughters
of the household, while another flaunts “Vera-
ena” alongside the doorpost in antique
copper. Round the corner, on an £ISOO resi-
dence, appears the amazing title of “Thisll
Do”; a neighboring householder has gone
one better, or thinks he has, with “Thislldo-
mee.”

“Billabong”
Encased-Gear Windmills
offer you a full measure of Service,
Dependability and Value.
Their outstanding quality and many exclusive features
make “BILLABONG” Pumping and Water-supply Plants the
preferred choice of all who demand the utmost of the above
qualities.
Referring to “BILLABONG” Windmills, an enthusiastic
owner writes as follows:
“ When in need of a Mill, I obtained catalogues of every
make of Mill known to me. These I submitted to two of my
brothers (who are expert mechanics, and one especially skilled
in machine design and construction), asking them to pick out a
Mill. They had not the slightest hesitation in arriving , at the
conclusion that the absolute superiority of the ‘BILLABONG’
oner all other makes was evidenced by even the most casual
perusal of the catalogues. I consider the ‘BILLABONG’ can
give points to every other make of Mill from top to bottom.”
“Billabong” Encased Windmills are sound in construction.
Everything which enters into their manufacture is of Australia s
best—they are rain- and dust-proof; weather influences cannot
affect the working parts, and with its unsurpassed oiling system,
friction and wear and tear is practically nil. The Encased-gear
“BILLABONG” is a silent and easy-running Windmill—one that
will give years of useful service.
Billabong Troughing
If you are looking for the very best trougliing write for full particulars of
a make that will give you years of EXTRA SERVICE —its name is
“BILLABONG.” Only high-grade material and the best workmanship enter
into its construction. “BILLABONG” TROUGHING is set in two or more
heavy angle steel frames, which form a most rigid bed and enable “BILLA-
BONG” Troughs to withstand rough usage and hard wear. This Troughing is
easily assembled and is made in styles to suit cattle, calves and sheep; and also
a very heavy type is made for pigs. “BILLABONG” Troughing is really worth
your full consideration.

“Jim Carew’': Re the filching of trade-
names essentially Australian. Recently I
have come across the “Kookaburra” sardine
tinned in Norway, the “Platypus” razor
made in Germany and the “Australian” steel
pen made in England.
* * * V.
“Michael Earle” (Vancouver) The poor
Indian has again been hit by civilisation;
China is supplying him with the eagle feather
he wears in his bonnet. That famous painter
of Indians, John Sharp, says there is such a
scarcity of eagles that traders are importing
them and charging their customers eight
shillings for the headgear.
* * * *
“Stellsby”: The deposits of waste-metal
clippings and other fillings at Burnley
(Melb.) were steadily disappearing until
someone woke up recently and found that
the despised stuff was being collected by en-
terprising bottle-olis and sold to German
agents, who shipped it to the Fatherland.
There it is melted down and becomes the
framework of toys and cheap fancy goods.
Fritz still does a whole lot of things while
we sleep.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: The Queensland meatworks
had a record output for 1925. During the
year all the meatworks in the State were
operating and the number of cattle killed,
551,854, exceeded by 5108 head the 1914
tally. In 1922 only 212,000 cattle were
slaughtered and in 1924 380,224. There has
been keen competition at the Brisbane sales
recently, prime quality bullock beef fetching
21s. to 295. per 1001 b., good trade beef
275. to 285., and prime quality cow beef 28s.
to 30s.
* * * *
“C.W.G.”: We used to get Australian
myall-wood pipes in London in the early
’eighties, and very good pipes they were.
They smoked sweeter than any others I have
ever used and the first pipeful was as good as
the last. They did not last very long, cer-
tainly, as they soon cracked, but that did not
matter much, as they cost only 4d, apiece.
I left England for Canada in ’B4 and came
on to Australia 15 years ago, and was look-
ing forward to being able to get these pipes;
but they don’t seem to be made now. Why?
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: Bankruptcy is supposed to
clear a man of his liabilities and give him
a fresh start, but this doesn’t hold good
where the War Service Homes Commissioner
is concerned. Several ex-Diggers who have
been forced into insolvency in this district
have pleaded the Act unsuccessfully to the
Commissioner and his representatives; gar-
nishees on their wages continue as before
the petition. The trouble is that State laws
are not binding on the Commonwealth, and
so the man who has filed his schedule is in
no way relieved of his liability to the Fed-
eral authorities.
* * * *
“Clerk” : One of the undefatigable Clapp’s
methods of helping Vic.’s fruit industry
might be followed by other Australian rail-
way heads. In collaboration with the
State’s Fruit Advisory Board, he has prac-
tically eliminated the middleman by intro-
ducing an arrangement whereby the person
who wants a case or half a case of fruit
just planks down enough cash to cover the
grower’s charge and the freight at the near-
est railway booking window, and then waits
for the delivery of the fruit at the station,
the s.-m. forwards the order on to the Fruit
Advisory people, who place it to the best
advantage. This ought to mean less surplus
fruit for the growers and increased freight
for Clapp.
* * * *
“Kriz”: Uncle Sam has been making in-
quiries into the possibilities of fish- and
turtle-canning in Nor’-Westralia. The
Yankee investigator who has been visiting
Broome has intimated that, if his scheme is
approved, £70,000 will be invested and works
established next year which will give em-
ployment to 200 men. There will be three
imported American experts—a chemist, pre-
server and canner—and a 150-ton wooden
vessel will bring the raw material to the
factory. It is further hinted that American
scientists will harness the tides, with their
immense ebb and flow, for electric current.
The waters of the nor’-west coast swarm witli
turtles; and at Turtle Bay thousands of egg;
can be dug up out of the sand.
* * * *
“G.D.M.”: In Melbourne £2,000,000 was
spent in 1925 in office buildings which pro-
vide 500,000 sq. ft. of floor space, said to
be lettable at 10s. a sq. foot. Most of it
cost more. The new tenants of these new
buildings are mostly agents for foreign firms
who work through an agent or broker in-
stead of through the big warehouses. It is
questionable whether 25 per cent, of the
available new offices are let, and it is hard
to say where new businesses and firms are
coming from to fill the rest now that there
are no more £25,000,000 loans in sight to
reward soldiers. A large part of Australia’s
“income” during the last few years has come
from loans. Should it be checked by a drought
or other national catastrophe, what is likely
to happen to the thousands of small and
mushroom businesses that now fill every
street and suburb of Melbourne?
* * * *
“Avon”: Maoriland, which prides itself on
having the purest-bred population of the
Empire with a smaller percentage of alien
blood than the Old Dart itself, is beginning
to get apprehensive, and the first fruit of
the apprehension is a “White New Zealand
League.” This has been formed up north,
where the Chinese cabbage-farmer has been
demonstrating for some years and in increas-
ing numbers that he can pay a better price
for land, freehold or leasehold, and still sell
his produce at a lower price than his white
competitor. In the northern towns, too, and
even as far south as Christchurch, the
Chinese fruiterer and greengrocer is elbow-
ing the white man out of the business,
mainly, to be candid, because he makes a
better fist of the business, as well as work-
ing longer hours and shaving prices. There
is a poll-tax of £lOO on Chinese, and no
ship may carry to M.L. more than one
Chinese for every 200 tons burden, but they
are increasing and myltiplying for all that.

“Tickets Please”: Appropriate surnames?
A man recently charged in a N.S.W • cour
for travelling on the tram without a tick
was named Thrift. It cost him a quid.
“Adamascus” : Bundaberg (Q.) has the
widest highway in Australia; Bourbon-street
can give Ballarat’s Sturt-street Ift. Bour-
bon, by the way, is not French derivation,
but pure abo.
“Coot”: Christ Church. Hawthorn (Vic.),
has probably the oldest baptismal-font in
Australia. In the ’fifties the extension of
St. Katherine’s Docks, London, necessitated
the demolition of an old church built ex-
pressly for sailors. Governor La I robe ? e '
cured the font and presented it to Christ
Church, where it has done duty at innumer-
able christenings.
“W.P.T.” : Re queer names. A N.S.W. rail-
way fireman surnatned Smith was christened
John George James Augustus Hay Henry
Riverina Goodall; naturally he is known as
Alphabetical Smith. Two parents named
Flower, of the South Coast of N.S.W., de-
cided to christen all their children appro-
priately. The first four, girls, are Lily,
Rose, Violet and Daisy. The fifth child was
a boy, and after perusing a seed catalogue
it was decided to call him Jonquil.
“Canberra”: An authoritative ruling on
the correct pronunciation of “Canberra” (B.
7/l/’26) is given in “Canberra’s First Hun-
dred Years” by Professor Frederick W. Rob-
inson, M.A., Ph.D. It is: “Accent first
syllable, pronouncing the vowel a as m
‘father.’ ” In Canberra itself, from which
I write, some people place the accent on
the first syllable and others on the second.
I think the former are in the majority. But
few "of them give the professorial pronuncia-
tion to the vowel a.
“Architect”: St. Mary’s Cathedral, Syd-
ney, claimed as the “finest example of Gothic
architecture in Australia” (B. 14/1/ 26), is
really what is known to the profession as
Methody-Gothic. Brisbane has the two finest
examples of Gothic work in the southern
hemisphere—the beautiful little R.C. chapel
in the grounds of St. Stephen’s, now sunk
into disrepair, and the rather wonderful An-
glican Cathedral of St. John, only partly
built. St. Mary’s can no more be compared
with either than any tin suburbau Salv’army
barracks can be compared with St. Mary’s.
“X2X”: When a Chinese opium-smoker
sets himself to break off the habit lettuce is
his main standby. He munches the vegetable
incessantly, and it really does have some
effect in alleviating his sufferings. Sometimes
a kind of wine or tincture is made by soak-
ing the herb in strong alcohol for several
days and then pouring off the spirit and
consuming the steeped leaves. Lettuce almost
certainly possesses properties of a mild
narcotic order, and, as such, can be employed
as a substitute for opium. In old times the
wine or tincture made from it was even
used to relieve pain, and in some pharmaco-
poeias this tincture is still to be found.
“Nomis”: I once travelled from Sydney
to Young (N.S.W.) with Monsignor Bona-
ventura Cerretti, formerly Papal Delegate
in Australia, and recently given the car-
dinal’s hat. A score of us had been invited
to that town to the laying of a foundation-
stone of an R.C. hospital. It was Friday,
and at about 10 p.m. every man Jack was
famishing for a sandwich after an early
tea. They were meat sandwiches, too, and
none dared to be unorthodox. Suddenly the
• prelate reached out his hand, took up a
bunch of them and soon spoilt their sym-
metry. He probably divined what was in
our minds, and none of us hesitated to follow
his example.
“Northerner”: The absorption of Brisbane
and South Brisbane in the Greater Brisbane
scheme leaves Queensland with 11 cities.
Outside the capital there are, to start with,
Townsville (pop. 26,456), Rockhampton
(25,000), Toowoomba (22,650), and Ipswich
(20,526) ; Cairns (8500), Gympie (8303)
and Mackay (7100) tail the field. Brisbane,
with a population estimated at 250,000, claims
to be the biggest city in the Commonwealth in
the municipal sense; the City Council admin-
isters for a larger population than those of
Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide put to-
gether. And in area administered by one
council, Brisbane (385 square miles) is also
easily first.
Australia owes thanks to Bailie Michael
Simons, who finished a long life in Glasgow
in November last. He inherited a share
and subsequently became the head of Eng-
land’s largest firm of fruit importers, whose
job at first was to rush fruit over from handy
places like Spain and Portugal, until Simons
made an experiment which resulted in a
regular service of fruit boats from the W est
Indies and Barbadoes, and poured pine-
apples and bananas on to the market. It
was the success of this enterprise that satis-
fied England regarding the possibility of
drawing fruit supplies from far distant lands.
To show her gratitude for services rendered
Spain made him a Knight of the Order
Isabella.
Second in command of the Queensland C.I.
branch is Detective Senior-Sergeant Lipp. A
stout, genial, handsome man, he doesn’t look
a bit like the traditional detective, but he is
a living encyclopaedia of crooks and criminals.
The other “D’s,” when at a loss for some
piece of criminal history, “look it up in
Lipp.” One of his jobs is to act as coun-
sellor and comforter to worried callers at the
C.I. office. His advice is sometimes highly
unofficial. The writer overheard him advising
a young woman who complained that she
was pestered by the unwanted attentions of
a man. “Smack him in the eye, Missus,”
advised the sergeant; “smack him right in
the eye!”
“H.K.”: At Glenelg (S.A.) the mayoral
chair is fashioned of timber taken from the
old Buffalo, which brought the State’s first

“The oak of which this chair was made was
part of the barque Inconstant, which was
stranded near Pencarrow Head, on August
19, 1850, and was afterwards used by Mr.
John Plimmer as a warehouse, known as
Noah’s Ark, on the site where the bank now
stands.” Incidentally, the bank is nowadays
a quarter of a mile from the sea-front; in the
days of the Inconstant wreck the site was

Conqueror Of The Mongouan Wilds
Dr. Roy Chapman Andrews, who startled the
world a few years ago by discovering a nest of
dinosaur eggs ten million years old, arrived in
, New York on November 9th from his Third
Asiatic Expedition under the auspices of the
American Museum of Natural History.
Again he attributes much of the success of his
expedition to the astounding performance of his
five Dodge Brothers Motor Cars.
Following is a direct quotation from an official
statement by Dr. Andrews upon his return to
America:
The Gobi Desert in Mongolia is the most
extensive undeveloped and unexplored re-
gion now left in the world. Until a few .
years ago it was retarded by the impossibly
slow traffic of camel trains, the only means
of communication.
But now it is being crisscrossed in every
direction by motor cars, or, more correctly
by one motor car, the Dodge. Sixty or
seventy Dodge Brothers cars are making
regular trips far into the interior of this vast
waste, bringing out loads of sables, precious
furs, wool and other products.
No other car except the Dodge is found there
because we have tried it out on each of our
three expeditions and have had it demon-
strated to our satisfaction that the Dodge
is the only car that will stand up under the
strain of the roadless desert and do every-
thing we ask of it.
Few people have occasion to subject their motor
cars to punishment of this severity. It is reassur-
ing, however, to know that in emergencies Dodge
Brothers Motor Car is built to meet the test.
These dependable and sturdy qualities also ac-
count for the fact that more than 90% of all the
motor cars Dodge Brothers have built during the
past eleven years, are still in active service.

ALAND of Sunset singing
Her anthems to the bold;
A land of fortune stringing
Upon a harp of gold
The tempting siren ditties
That to adventure call;
Not yet a land of cities,
But oldest land of all.
Wide spaces, spreading over
From Eucla unto Broome,
You give the careless rover
A subtle sense of room;
Nine hundred miles to Nowhere
You have to offer still;
You bid the wild men go where
On silent trails they will.
If I were free to wander,
With manhood just begun,
This Land of Over-Yonder,
This Virgin of the Sun,
Would draw my heart unto her.
With camels out of Cue
I'd leave the world to woo lie?
With skies like eyes of blue.
I'd seek her secrets hidden,
Or in her service die,
And be with her forbidden
Lovers who whitely lie,
Unfound and starkly staring
By light of moon and sun—
Her lovers done with daring
And no adventure won.
What hearts they had, those lovers!
They seldom saw her smiles
Who, witch-like, won them over
The weary, thirsty miles;
And then with Death-rings wedded
Their dying hands at last,
Her careless feet embedded
In carpets of the past!
The Sun-King’s elder daughter
Who strangely distant seems,
To them who have besought her,
The maiden of their dreams,
She weaves her magic, alien,
Beside the Indian Sea;
A witch but half Australian,
Half Oriental she.

Before the Dutchmen faring
Around the Leeuwin turned,
An Arab crew came stealing
By bluff and mangrove creek
Who’d seen the hot seas heeling
The flanks of Mozambique.

Upon some future day,
Go seek that time-stained treasure

The chart by which the'head-men
On swift mat-sailed prahus
Bore south with careful lead-men
And brown reliant crews.

"I.T."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FOR the two-hundredth time since the
copy of his book, “The Excrescences
of Exertion,” had come into his hand,
B. Blabbin turned over its thumbed leaves
to read again some of the stories he had told
about himself. Stories about himself repre-
sented Blabbin's idea of the highest in litera-
turn; press-cutting books filled with such re-
ferences were the chief treasures of his
library.
Blabbin had experienced disappointment
that the book had not created the sensation he
had anticipated. He had a feeling that a
chronicle of his spectacular life was just the
thing every reading man and woman would
hunger to read, probably estimating that
people’s tastes are mostly similar, and know-
ing that his own interest was mainly in
Y. B. Blabbin. Without doubt his life had
been spectacular; few men had succeeded in
losing so much money so quickly, and none
had so nearly managed to get the performance
accepted as a triumph. If anybody talked of
floating a company with £5OOO capital to do
some useful work and he felt interested
in it, he immediately turned the company
into one of £500,000, spent most of the money
in advertising, and then explained that the
affair, though a failure, was a glorious fail-
ure ; and if anybody suggested a land-
settlement scheme which seemed likely to
succeed on a small scale he turned it into
a new State, and subsequently explained that
the reason why it wasn’t a success was that
others had not the same Napoleonic vision
as himself. That was “the Y.B. way”—he
had coined that phrase himself, and was
proud of the manner in which it had been
adopted. The Y.B. w r ay included dashing
over a couple of hundred miles of country-
in a motor-car, getting fined for speed, and
then settling a bit of business which might
have been concluded by a letter at the cost
of There w r as no doubt he was spec-
tacular ; so spectacular that there were hun-
dreds who, in spite of his reverses, believed
that he must be a Napoleon of finance be-
cause he spoke so easily in millions. It was
a life full of fireworks; and he felt that people
who had watched the display must admire
the man who had made it.
So lie had put it all down in his book,
in which he had made the hero “1.T.” as a
thin disguise for the man whom, he fondly
believed, all the world knew as “Y. 8.” I.T.
was exactly the sort of hero he imagined
himself to be; and in the delight of work-
ing out his history, as seen by himself, he
left nothing to the imagination. All of
even his love-affairs were here, showing how
the ardor of a full-blooded personality made
his moral lapses excusable.
Reading the book again, he felt that it
was a packet of bombs which must explode
sooner or later and flash the name of Y. B.
Blabbin once more before the people.
Rising, he walked to a drawer to examine
a revolver which lay within it. It was
loaded in all its chambers, and he put it
down again. He felt that, with the revolver,
he could cope with any situation which
might arise. There danced before his eyes
newspaper headlines like:
“Y.B.’ 1 AGAIN.
Initiative Frustrates Assailant.
“Excrescences of Exertion” Resented.
lie even pictured people reading those head-
ings and saying to one another; “Remarkable
chap, Y. B. Blabbin! The man who thinks
to catch him napping takes on a tough
job!”
His first idea had been that whispers of
what was in the book would circulate even
before it was published; but the city seemed
absolutely unmoved. It almost appeared as if
Blabbin might just as well not have written
a book. But he was an optimist ; he assured
himself that when the reviews were pub-
lished the sensation would start. The re-
views rather annoyed him. He could have
stood any amount of abuse, would have wel-
comed it; but the brief space and the disre-
gard with which they merely remarked that
the style was poor and it would have been
in better taste if a lot had been left out,
angered him. He had expected the critics,
amongst other people, to rave, and they
unanimously declined to be so much as in-
terested.
Still his optimism enabled him to overlook
that. The book was now definitely out, and
developments must come. He walked into
town with an heroic feeling that he was
issuing a challenge to the goaded people who
would want to kill him. His mind conjured
visions of the scene—the swift attack in a
crowded part of the city by a man berserk
with rage; his own coolness in simulta-
neously disarming his opponent and sending
him to the ground ; his calm, dignified words :
“Pretty cowardly, don’t you think, attacking
a defenceless man with a thing like this?”
After that the cheers of the crowds as he
moved off; and, of course, the reports in the
papers.
But —nothing happened. He grew im-
patient under the strain of waiting; and that
impatience goaded him, when he met Samuels
—w 7 ho might well have been an assailant —
to ask “Read my book?”
“Didn’t know you had written a book,”
said Samuels.
“Didn’t know! Haven’t you seen about
it ?”
“No; what’s it all about?”
Blabbin left him with a curse; and getting
home, felt tired with disappointment. But
the regular re-reading of his book brought
back his bright hopes. He found it amusing
to conjecture xvhere the first assault would
come from. Would the man Mabel had mar-
ried, resentful of his wife’s appearance in
the chronicle, fall angrily upon him ; or would
Maudsley, angry at the revelation of the
way he was beaten in the financial trans-
action over
He leapt suddenly to his feet at a stealthy
sound at the door. The revolver was in his
hand as he demanded to know who was there.
A thick voice—obviously disguised—mumbled
something intended to be reassuring; and to
show his enemy that he was not frightened,
Y.B. opened the door.
“Lorst me bloomin’ way,” said the man
at the door. “Whash sthreet's thish?”
After he had disgustedly got rid of the
drunk, Y.B, fastened the door and returned
to restore the revolver to its hiding-place.
He soon thrilled ns he returned to his book.
There would be developments all right
There were.
“Put th° se hands of yours up,” cried a
muffled voice. Blabbin, with a jumping
heart, swung round, and his arms did go up
as he faced a revolver hold in the hand of
a squat, pasty-facod man.
“You swine 1” growled the intruder.

A TREACHEROUS TROUBLE
Kidney diseases are very dangerous. They come on
silently, gain ground rapidly, and cause thousands of
deaths that could have been prevented by proper
treatment in the beginning. Nature gives early
warnings of kidney disease; —backache, twinges of
pain when stooping or lifting, headaches or urinary
disorders. If these symptoms are unheeded there is
grave danger of fatal kidney disease. Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills have earned a reputation for
their effectiveness in kidney trouble and are known
and recommended the world over.

EXPERIENCES OF SYDNEY PEOPLE.
Mr. Lewis Williams, 602 Botany Road, Botany, Sydney, says :—“I was
a great sufferer with my back and the pain was at times so bad t
to leave my work and go home. I was bent almost double _ and oo
stand up straight without increased suffering. I used various prep ,
but only got slight relief. Reading of cures effected by Joan s Backache
Kidney Pills, I decided to tty them. One bottle eased the pain and the
second completed my cure. This did not happen ab
years ago, and I have had no sign of backache all that tltne, so
mere temporary relief, but a perfect cure. I am always advising my f
to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and am glad to have an opi y
to publicly recommend them.”

Blabbin felt that he was not cutting the
figure he had intended ; those unfair ciicurn
stances which, as he explained in his book,
had so often conspired against him, had put
the revolver in his opponents hand instead
of his own; but he felt it was up to him to
make an effort. , ,
“If it is merely idle curiosity that brought
you in like this,” ho said, “I am. And now
perhaps you’ll put down that silly toy and
get out —and be thankful you don t stand
your trial for housebreaking.” _
“I’ll get out when I’ve done with you,
cried the intruder, wrath in his tone. xou
—you thing, writing like that about women .
'So that was it; and Blabbin swiftly won-
dered which woman’s champion this would
be. Mabel’s, perhaps, or Helen’s, or
“Who the devil are you?” he demanded.
“I ain’t afraid to tell you who I am, re-
torted his assailant, “I’m Podger, I am, an
I’m a waiter at Tinpot’s Hotel; an I m here
to make you do justice to a girl you ve
wronged.” .
Blabbin’s heart sank. A waiter. Inis
was reducing the plane upon which he had
plotted his sensation; a small, pasty-taced
waiter! , _ , , T
“Sit down there an write what 1 ten
you !” came the command.
■ After one glance at the revolver Blabbin
sat down; at another order he took up a
pen. The position had become humiliating.
“Now write!” commanded Podger. I
hereby declare that what I wrote in my book,
the ‘Exercises of Exertion’
• “‘Excrescences,’ corrected Blabbin.
“Whatever its blarsted name is,” said
Podger—“on page 349 thereof, is all lies,
and I tender my sincerest apologies to the
lady therein mentioned.”
Blabbin felt that absurdity was being
added to the humiliation of the situation;
and he was also full of amazement. But,
under reminders of the revolver, lie wrote
what was commanded, and passed it over.
“I’ve done it, curse you!” he said. “But
page 349! There was nothing on page
349 that I can remember that would make
anyone come here as you have done. Look
here—here’s the book.”
“Stand back!” commanded Podger. Read
—and you will see what’s wrong.”
Wonderingly Blabbin read aloud:
“The Beecham household was a quiet one,
and contained probably one of the most in-
efficient of all servants in one Hannah” ——
“Stop !” yelled Podger wildly. “ ’Ow dare
you say a'thing like that about my wife?
She ain’t insufficient —she ain’t insufficient
for me, anyway. A man ought to plug yer
one-A-writing a thing that I mightn’t have
seen if a bloke hadn’t left it at our pub
saying it’s no good. But”
It was too humiliating. With a crushed
spirit Y.B. let the only man who took any
notice of what was in his book go out of his
life.
HAMER.
Hard Earned.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was election time in Maoriland. Joe
Ward was contesting Awarua against
an opponent who had far more chance
of breaking into the harem of the Sultan of
Turkey than he had of entering Parliament
by that route. There was a polling booth
at Ruapuke, a little island a few miles south
of the Bluff, ruled over by King Topi. Its
sole inhabitants then were the family and a
multitude of relations of the dignitary afore-
said, a few wekas, innumerable rabbits, half
a hundred crossbred sheep and a school-
master. The last named gentleman’s mission
in life was to initiate the Maori youngsters
into such mysteries of figuring and account-
construction as would enable them to cheat
with the abandon and the impudence of the
pakeha, as though they were not inherently
skilled in all the subtle arts. He was, more-
over, the island physician, tke spiritual
adviser to the settlement, King Topi’s Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer and general dictator.
He was Returning Officer as well. He had
a lame leg, side whiskers and a He
acknowledged only one earthly deity- Jay
Gee Warrud.” His name was I atnck
Aloysius Xavier Michael Joseph O’Halloran.
And it was I upon whom was bestowed
the honor of acting as poll-clerk to Mr.
O’Halloran the actual, if not the nominal,
ruler of Ruapuke, and two guineas I was to
earn besides.
Seldom in latitude 47 s. do we experience
such a breezeless, radiant, sunshiny December
morning as was the one on which we crossed
the strait to Ruapuke. As the launch chugged
over a rippleless surface the engineer and
I discussed the day’s programme. We had
come armed with a gun, some fishing lines
and a couple of bottles of whisky. I had
suggested bringing a few sandwiches, but the
engineer reckoned they would be unnecessary.
Topi was very said, and there
would be plenty of tucker at the pa. There
were ducks on the island, and he suggested
that, after I had delivered to the Returning
Officer the voting papers (of which I had
sufficient to exercise the franchises of the
entire electorate), we should make a tour of
the island, with a couple of wahines as
guides. Then, lie added, we could return
to King Topi’s for dinner, and laze away
the rest of the afternoon on the beach or
around the rocks. The resolution was carried
unanimously'. But we were reckoning with-
out Mr. O’Halloran.
I had never acted as poll-clerk before, nor
have I since, so I have to confess to a
very hazy conception of the duties attach-
ing to the exalted position. Therefore, it
was with considerable apprehension and tre-
pidation that I faced the elaborate ceremonial
prepared by Mr. O’Halloran, as he stumped
down the beach to give us greeting, his side
whiskers flying like pennons in the breeze
and a battalion of Maoris of all ages in Ins
wake. He directed tlie landing with Ins
shillelagh, and flourished in Ins other liana
a sheaf of documents. As we stepped ashore
he drew his grinning bodyguard into a halt-
circle about him, mounted a kerosene case
which one of them placed in the sand in
front of him, and proceeded to read his
appointment as Returning Officer on this
memorable occasion. Then he called foi
three cheers for “Jay Gee W arrud.
So enthusiastic was the response of his
retinue that he was knocked off Ins perch.
That made him angry. He gyrated and
blustered and shook his sceptre so threaten-
ingly that the army took to the bush. He
looked at first as though he were going into
the manuka scrub to round them up, but,
after consulting his watch, remounted the
box and proceeded to read my appointment
as poll-clerk, much to the delight of my
engineer, who, having unloaded the gun and
the bottled ammunition, was beckoning to a
female deserter who had taken sanctuary
behind a log. At Mr O’Halloran s behest
I handed over my load of ballot-papers, the
receipt of which he acknowledged m legal
phraseology that would have done ciedit
to the Chief Justice. Peremptorily command-
ing me to bring along the kerosene case and
the whisky, he led the way to the schooi-
house, from the steps of which I could see
the engineer and a pretty wahine reclining
on the beach with all the grace of a Coogee
sheik and siren.
Little did I dream, as I turned my back
on the glorious sunshine, that it was to be
denied to me for the rest of the day. . Th
schoolliouse was the usual one-roomed dismal
affair, fitted with forms and decorated with
a map of the world and numerous designs
in charcoal, the product of the diseased imagi-
nation of a gentleman with a lame leg and
bushy side whiskers. It was permeated from
rafters to floor with the odour of. mutton-
bird fat. It had a bit of a lean-to. This
was Mr. O’Halloran’s bedroom, study, dining-
room, drawing-room and kitchen, combined.
Into this unwholesome den went he and 1
and the kerosene-case and the voting-papers
and the bottle of whisky. He placed the
bottle under the bundle of old coats which
acted as a pillow, stuck the kerosene-case m
the middle of the floor and brought forth a
kerosene-tin, one end of _ which had oeen
slashed with an axe. This was the ballot-
box. It was stuck on the upended kerosene-
case. Having thus got the booth ready, Mr.
OTlalloran hobbled to the door, and, to an
audience of one weka and about a dozen sea-
gulls, declared the poll open.
He didn’t think there would be many
voters, he confessed to me, as the Maoris had
no vote in. Awarua (they have an election
of their own), and he was the only white
resident of Ruapuke on the roll. Still, a
poll was a poll, and the booth had to be
kept open. Maybe Jay Gee Warrud him-
self would sail the strait that wonderful day,
to be sure, if only to have a chip wid him.
bein’ such old friends, and never an election
goin’ past but at least one vote cornin’ to
him from Ruapuke, God save him, and that
vote maybe turnin’ the iliction in his favor.
And would I keep a sharp lookout through
the winder all the day lest Jay Gee and
Missus Jay Gee and all the little Jay Gees
might take it into their heads to come on
him all of a sudden like.
It would be painful for me to relate how
I pleaded with Mr. O’Halloran to release me
from duty, just for an hour or two. He
was adamant. Would it be upsetting the
whole iliction and imperilling the return of
Jay Gee Warrud that I wud be at? Wasn’t
it laid down clearly in the Statute that the
booth had to have the Returning Officer and
the poll-clerk in constant attendance or the
iliction might be declared null and void?
And what would Jay Gee think uv him if
lie came over and found his seat was being
made unsafe? I tried flattery—praised his
school, his side whiskers and his father. To-
wards midday he suggested we should play
crib, and he brought out a grimy pack which
was short of two aces and a deuce, together
with a bar of soap for a scoring-board. For
a couple of hours I let him win, the ballot-
box in the meanwhile having been pushed out
of the road under the bunk. I mentioned
something about eating, but was reminded
that the preparation of a meal would mean
that one would have to go outside to get
water from the tank, and that could not be
done under the Electoral Act. Then it was
that he remembered about the bottle of
whisky. He poured out a thimbleful for
me, and started on the remainder. He drank
Jay Gee’s health ten times, and then, to
my great joy, began to show signs of drowsi-
ness. He said he would lay down for a
while, rolled to the door, turned the key.
placed it under his pillow of old coats, and
left m e there to gaze helplessly upon his
snoring horizontality for the rest of the
It was half-past eight when Mr. O’Hal-
loran returned to a consciousness of his
duty. I was in a frame of mind to let him
sleep till the Day of Judgment, but the engi-
neer, failing to get a response to knocks and
kicks, was attacking the door with the butt
of his gun. That roused the Returning
Officer. Neither he nor anyone else had voted.
The poll had been closed half an hour.
Brought to a realisation of how things stood,
he cursed me in many languages for disgrac-
ing him in the eyes of Jay Gee, whose majo-
rity, he said, would be considerably reduced
and whose wrath would be incurred because
of the non-casting of the O’Halloran vote,
lie rolled from the bunk, unlocked the door,
seized the kerosene-tin and staggered forth
to declare the poll. He viciously attacked
the tin with a crowbar, widened the gash
sufficiently to enable him to make quite sure
the ballot-box was empty, and proceeded to
address the assembled population, which to
a unit had been attracted by the racket.
As the nose of our launch began to move
in the direction of the Bluff, we could just
]v-ar Mr. O’Halloran calling for Three
cheers for Jay Gee Warrud,” and dimly see
him being pelted with cow-dung by the Maori
lads and lasses of his diocese.
