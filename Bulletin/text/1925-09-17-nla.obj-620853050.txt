Is Psycho-analysis “Bunk”?
Every generation adopts a superior atti-
tude towards the two previous generations.
It is a privilege of youth. The past were
dark ages; the present is always an age of
enlightenment. How the Georgians have de-
spised the Victorian, early, middle and late,
for their complacency, their narrow-minded-
ness, their hypocrisy, and, above all, their
love of illusions! They knew nothing in the
dark ages of Darwin and Huxley, but they
thought they knew everything; that was their
cardinal sin. They all had the absurd assur-
ance that they were seeing life steadily and
seeing it whole, while all the time they were
the most prejudiced and gullible' of mortals.
They could believe anything. It was the
pride of the Georgian'age, not only to shatter
the fixed and false beliefs of their heavy
fathers, but to reveal itself as free-minded
and completely disillusioned—an age without
“bunk.”
But just when we thought we were safest,
it is annoying that a typical young Georgian
should arise and mockingly accuse not his
predecessors but his contemporaries of their
love of hocus-pocus. It seems incredible, yet
Aldous Huxley maintains that those of us
who take “an intelligent interest in science”
are quite as gullible as our unenlightened
ancestors who believed in phrenology, phy-
siognomy and animal magnetism, for nowa-
days most of us believe in psycho-analysis.
According to this ruthless young iconoclast,
psycho-analysis is not a real science but
a pseudo-science, “one of the finest speci-
mens of its kind ever devised by the mind of
man.” Science relies on experiment, sifted
evidence and a severe logic, while pseudo-
science prefers “short cuts to the absolute,
backstairs ■ approaches to certainty, get-rich-
quick methods of acquiring the truth.”
Psycho-analysis is based on mere assump-
tions treated as facts, and on analogies in-
stead of logical reasoning. It must there-
fore be classed with pseudo-sciences, such as
astrology, magic and alchemy.
I find it difficult to forgive Huxley for
this unexpected onslaught. If his criticism
is valid,' he will deprive many of us of a
most attractive pastime, one of the simple
pleasures of the poor. For psycho-analysis,
whatever, else it might be, was one of the
best of indoor games, more amusing than
mah jongg, more alluring than chess, much
more exciting than bridge. To those who
were in the know, what could be more en-
trancing than listening to some very proper
person who insisted on telling everybody
her dreams? Warnings were in vain; there
was always some elderly lady, demure and
sometimes sanctimonious, who earnestly re-
lated how she had dreamed she was on the
brink of a precipice or flying through the air
like a bird, or standing by the seashore,
where happy children were sporting in the
waves, unblushingly recording some little
symbolic picture that seemed quite innocent
and even poetical to the uninitiated, but was
fraught with a deeper and darker meaning
to students of Freud. It was astounding
how many women—matrons or spinsters, it
made no difference —delighted in erotic
dreams, birth fantasies,and the revelation of
suppressed desires. They had no notion
what shocking confessions they were mak-
ing;. that was the most delightful part of
the wicked game. The manifest content of
their pretty little dreams was but a symbol
of the more significant latent content.' But
to earnest students who knew how to inter-
pret them, like the augurs of old, dreams
were tremendously suggestive.
And, again, if psycho-analysis has to be
dismissed like phrenology, how will people
in society find suitable topics for conversa-
tion in their more intellectual moments?
Between a foxtrot and a two-step, and dur-
ing the hushed silence of the saxophone, the
modern young man will be at a loss how to
impress his fair partner with his liveliness
find learning if lie is no longer permitted to
indulge in a little airy persiflage about sym-
bolic numbers and the CEdipus Complex.
Huxley rendered a poor service to his fellow-
students. For there are many vastly attrac-
tive features in Freud’s doctrine of the Un
Conscious. It opens up a whole new world
beneath the surface of the conscious mind,
a wild and melodramatic world, like Fitzroy
at its best, pulsating with all those wicked
thoughts, erotic desires and fearsome lusts
for power and sensual pleasure that in the
interests of man’s social and civilised life
had to be violently Suppressed. The Uncon-
scious* makes savages of us all. Wc are all
he-men or vamps of the jungle, liable to
break out at. any moment from our inhibi-
tions. and, by a careless word or gesture, as
clearly as in the world of dreams, display
ourselves in our true colors. The Uncon-
scious, wherein our real essential nature is
hidden, explains everything. There are no
secrets in psycho-analysis. One of Freud’s
most entertaining books is his “Psycho-
analysis of Everyday Life.” From it we
learn that, urged on by our unconscious self,
we always do what we want to do. Wc
would be more likely to keep an appointment
to receive a cheque or a medal than one when
we had to pay a hill. We would probably
feel well enough to go to a concert or a
cricket match, while a sudden cold or head-
ache, which we cleverly acquired on pur-
pose, might easily keep us away from church
or a lecture on economics. We might mean
to do our duty, but unconsciously we could
always find some excuse for avoiding any-
thing unpleasant and doing the thing we
really wanted to do. We learn also, what
we knew before, that many a true word is
spoken in jest, the explanation being that,
forgetting our well-guarded selves in the ex-
citement of the moment, our Unconscious
cheerfully blurts out the truth. This is com-
mon wisdom, as confirmed by the ages, like
the proverb “In vino reritas,” which comes
to the same thing.
I thought there was a lot of shrewd, homely
wisdom in that book; so it is distressing
to find it denounced as fantastic balderdash
and Freud described as a “bunk”-morchant.
It seemed to me that, scientific or not. Freud,
and to a lesser degree Adler and Jung, had
made an interesting contribution to psy-
chology. But here lies another difficulty.
Gan psychology, though it is taught in the
universities, be called a science? Perhaps
it is all “bunk,” too. The proper study of
mankind is man, wrote Pope; but modern
authorities, like Lawrence and Huxley,
assure us that no such study can ever be-
come really scientific. The subject of all
pseudo-science, Huxley contends, from magic
to animal magnetism, from astrology to
psycho-analysis, has always been Man—and
Man in his moral nature, Man as a suffering
and enjoying being. The reason is that no
preliminary, training is necessary, for we
all know about Man, or think we do. But,
unfortunately, Man, by the -very nature of
the case, can never be the subject of an
exact science. He is too elusive and mys-
terious. His actions and reactions are in-
calculable. Therefore we reach the unsatis-
factory conclusion that anything that has to
do with Man, such, as the popular and excit-
ing subjects of economics, politics, sociology,
psychology and ethics, can never attain, like
chemistry or physics, to the rank of a so-
called “exact” science. They are all “bunk,”
balderdash, hocus-pocus, and must be put in
the class of pseudo-science with psycho-
analysis.
It is all rather devastating, but that is
what we have to expect when we live in the
Georgian age.
LOUIS ESSON.
The Jewish Race and Literature
In Warsaw last April, to commemorate
the tenth anniversary of the death of a
Yiddish writer, I. L. Pcretz, a memorial was
unveiled; and 20,000 Jews from all parts of
Europe thought it worth while to attend the
ceremony. This must stand amongst the
greatest tributes that have been paid to any
writing-man. It is just a sign of the pas-
sionate admiration that the Jewish race
throughout its existence has entertained for
its intellectuals. The spirit prompting the
demonstration supplies a reason for the sur-
vival of the Jews as an individual race, and
is more explanatory than the mere devotion
of the people to peculiar customs. Many
Jews, as a matter of fact, have been lax
observers of those customs; but devotion to
the learned who philosophised and argued
upon the traditions of Israel has never failed,
and, ‘in effect, Israel has survived by its
literature.
To non-Jews the most notable of the
Chosen are those who are amongst the
world’s millionaires; but the greatest of all
these is prepared to pay deference to the
poorest son of Israel who can claim a full
knowledge of the Talmud and the Midrash,
the repositories of the ancient literature of
the Hebrews. Wliat is better, they regard
it not only as a sacred duty but as an honor
to see that such a man does not want. To-
day the poet Bialik, so little known outside
Jewry that Australian journals in publish-
ing, cables about the opening of the Hebrew
University made the name anything but
Bialik, is the greatest exponent of pure
Hebrew letters; and the earliest action in
regard to that university was to find a
comfortable place for the poet in the Chair
of Hebrew Literature and Philosophy.
The Jewish custom of supporting intellect
goes back to the earliest times; and the
opportunity it has given to many poor stu-
dents has been largely responsible for th
extent to which Jewish names have shon
in the world’s intellectual firmament. Som
memorable customs prevailed, and still pre
vail to some extent in parts of Europe. Th
Jewish child of the poorest parents who, ii
some remote European village, showed intel
lectual precocity was not allowed to g<
through life without a chance; the Jewisl
minister who had charge of his instruction saw
to it that lie passed to the instruction of sonv
noted rabbi conducting classes supported by
his community, at which he would study the
Talmud —the basis of all scholarship witl
the Jews. Later, as a youth, he would make
his way to a university town with no fear
of starving, although he might be penniless
A letter from his teacher certifying to his
mental capacity was all the fortune he
needed. Asa matter of course he presented
this, with his pocket-book, to the wealthier
Jews in the university town ; and, equally
as a matter of course, each wealthy Jew
would mark the weekly amount lie was pre-
pared to give for the student’s support, back-
ing it with an invitation to dine on certain
days, or even offering him lodging. There-
after he had merely to present his book’ on
the appointed occasions to receive liis due
from the. benefactor or his accountant. If,
for special study, he required to go to an-
other university, the same letter or one from
a professor would make his path easy.
However ignorant he was himself, the Jew
with the money realised that he had an obli-
gation to support the intelligent of his race,
and would feel shame if it could he said
against him in synagogue that lie had de-
clined a reasonable application. Moreover, the
brilliant young Jew was helped by a custom of
early marriage. The boy who showed men-
tal parts was eagerly sought as a husband
for the daughter of wealthy Jews. The con-
tract for marriage was often made when a
boy was ten or eleven years of age. the pros-
pective father-in-law paying a considerable
sum of money, and in many cases undertaking
the whole charge of the support of the bo.v
until his education was finished. Solomon
Maimon. a disreputable philosopher who had
a considerable influence upon the Germanic
philosophical school, was contracted bv his
father, an impecunious rabbi with a large
family, to two girls, the spendthrift ways of
the old man and his keen need of money
leading him to that recklessness. In the
fight that followed Solomon was seized bv
one of his prospective mothers-in-law anil
married at the age of 14; but, leaving Poland
to continue liis studies, he stayed in Germany
and never saw his wife again.
A lot of abuses naturally entered into
this system. Young men given a free leg
and no financial worries thought more about
enjoying life than their studies; and amongst
the tricks played was the sale of their
books” by some of the students. But even

these and other abuses— including *e .exac-
tions of “Schnorrers,” who, on a smatteinv
of Talmudic lore, wandered from community
to community, living upon them were borne
patiently in the general reverence tor learn-
The earlier abandonment of such customs
amongst the western Jews, particularly
those of England, probably explains why in
England Jewish names have not occurred
with such constancy amongst the lists or
the intellectually great; but even in Australia,
where the old customs are unknown, there
remains u feeling of responsibility towards
youthful talent. Whenever it makes itself
evident the poverty of parents presents no
bar to the educational progress of its posses-
sor; a call upon the wealthy is sure to be
met with a response that removes all finan-
cial difficulties in whatever branch of learn-
ing or art the talent is displayed.
There have been intellectual Jews, such as
Max Nordau, who have died in poverty; but,
although Nordau strayed from the Jewish
fold, it was really his pride which kept from
him the aid the Jews would willingly 7 have
rendered. There are scores of instances to-
day of members of the race, unable to make
financial headway, who have been provided
with positions that are really sinecures in
order that they may continue at ease 111 the
intellectual pursuits which have earned thorn
reverence. Their troubles are frequently ot
their own making, the purely intellectual
Jew being frequently as prodigal as the com-
mercial Jew 7 is reputed to be frugal.
The world has benefited by this Jewish
encouragement of learning, and there has
been, a reaction of benefit to the race in the
toleration which the services to humanity of
these men of learning have won from a one-
time entirely hostile world. But to the Jews
themselves the greatest benefit is the main-
tenance of the national integrity.
SCHNORRER.
Shakspeare’s Drunkards
Frank Harris claims that Shakspeare was
largely the. original of his own Cassio, who
confessedly had “very poor and unhappy
brains for drinking,” and wished that cour-
tesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment. Shakspeare does not hesi-
tate to lay responsibility for the drunken
scene in “Othello” upon the shoulders of
most villainous, “honest” lago, who sets the
sick fool Roderigo to carouse “potations
pottle deep” and then makes drunk the easily-
overcome Cassio and arranges a brawl be-
tween them. Poor Cassio, quickly drunk,
quickly sober, is as self-revealing a mortal
as any other in Shakspeare's plays, and one
with whom his creator is in manifest sym-
pathy. “I remember a mass of things, but
nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing
wherefore —O God, that men should put an
enemy in their mouths to steal away their
brains! That we should with joy, pleas'ance,
revel and applause, transform ourselves into
beasts.” lago responds as a typical man of
the world, a “good chap,” with customary
consolation : “Good wine is a good, familiar
creature if it be well used —you, or any
man living, may be drunk at some time,
man.” Shakspeare shows Cassio much ten-
derness, and when Othello’s occupation has
ended, it is to his dismissed lieutenant that
the office falls.
Less fortunate than Cassio is the noble
Antony, slave to love and pleasure’s play-
thing. In “Antony and Cleopatra” the
strain of revel is strung till it snaps; even
in the earlier “Julius Caesar,” the morning
of Caesar’s assassination brings from Julius
the welcome: —
See! Antony, that revels long- o’ nights,
Is notwithstanding - up.
Octavius Caesar reproaches Antony in his
absence: —
This is the news; he fishes, drinks and wastes
The lamps of night in revel.
Antony apologises to Octavius for neglect-
ing to give his messenger an audience, with
the excuse that he had newly feasted three
kings and “did want of what I was in the
morning.” This does not prevent the subse-
quent banquet aboard Pompey’s galley, where
Lepidus is carried helpless to bed. Octavius
finds the conquering wine too powerful.
Antony, for all his bravery and generosity,
betrays signs of an alcoholic brain. Against
the dictates of prudence he allows Cleopatra
to influence him so that lie tries his fortune
by sea instead of land, where he -held the
advantage. Before going the second time
into battle he instructs his servants: —
Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night,
Scant not my cups.... Let’s to supper
And drown consideration....
On the next morning he gains his last vic-
tory—he could defeat everyone but himself
—and regrets that his palace has not the
capacity to camp his host so that they could
all sup together. Twenty-four hours later
his death eventuates, and Cleopatra finds
in his absence a dull world “no better than
a sty.” Even in his excesses it is impossible
not to admire Antony, his spirit is large as
bis utterance; there is nothing common in
his composition. But Shakspeare makes of
him a dreadful example of the man who will
allow himself no prohibition.
The Porter in “Macbeth” presents a
shrewd and humorous indictment of intoxi-
cating liquor: “We were carousing to the
second cock, and drink, sir, is a great pro-
voker of three things—nose-painting, sleep
and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and un-
provokes ; it provokes the desire but it takes
away the performance; therefore much drink
may be said to be an equivocator with
lechery; it makes him, and it mars him; it
sets him on, and it takes him off.”
Hamlet notes alcoholic indulgence as one
of his treacherous uncle’s many failings:—-
The King cloth wake to-night, and takes his rouse. ...
The heavy-headed revel, east and west,
Makes us traduc’d and taxed of other nations;
They clepe us drunkards....
And Timon of Athens ruins himself in pro-
digal entertainment of fair-weather friends,
only to find his honored guests his severest
critics.
Falstaff, the greatest of Shakspeare’s
drinkers, presents an epic of roguery in him-
self ; his creator gave him amusement, but
an ironical, unhappy ending, when the newly-
ascended King Henry Y. responds to his
greeting with
I know thee not, old man, fall to thy prayers.
ITow ill white hairs become a fool and jester!
I have long dream’d of such a kind of man
So surfeit-swell’d, so old and so profane;
But being awake, I do despise my dreams....
Much has been written of Falstaff, in whom
some seek to find a symbol of the great Eliza-
bethan age! As a stage figure he is allur-
ing despite his boasting and his cowardice;
his prototype in real life would make an
intolerable companion. Yet he is an irresist-
ible sort of rogue; how mirthfully one re-
calls the bill pulled from F'alstaff’s pocket:—
Item, a capon .. . . • • 2s. 2d.
Item, sauce . • • • • • 4d.
Item, sack two gallons . . ss. Bd.
Item, anchovies and sack after
supper . . .. •. 2s. 6d.
Item, bread .. . . • • l‘d.
Well justified was l’rince Henry’s com-
ment: “O monstrous! But one halfpenny
worth of bread to this intolerable deal of
sack!”
In “The Merchant of Venice” we find the
young German, the Duke of Saxonys
nephew, is liked by Portia “very vilely in
the morning when he is sober, and most
vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk;
when he is best he is a little worse than a
man ; and when he is worst lie is little better
than a beast.” More pleasant are the
drunken scenes in “Twelfth Night," and
there is infinite ironical humor in “Measure
for Measure,” which Bernard Shaw con-
siders a better play than "Hamlet,” and, for
me, is the most absorbing of all Shakspeare’s
works. When Barnardine is informed that
the warrant for his execution has arrived
he protests: “You rogue, I have been
drinking all night; I am not fitted fort.”
To him the Clown: “O the better, sir. for he
that drinks all night and is bang’d betimes
in the morning may sleep the sounder all
the next day.” And Pompey the tapster,
Pompey the bawd, what a glorious rascal
is here! Escalus is sitting to judge him.
and asks him bis vocation. He replies:
“Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would
live.”" “How would you live, Pompey?” re-
turns Escalus; “by being a bawd ? What
do you think of the trade, Pompey? Is it
a lawful trade?” “If the law would allow
it, sir,” replies the unabashed rogue. What
a wealth of cynical wisdom is contained
in that comment —“if the law would allow
it”! Morals are a question of geography,
and what is legal in one country is criminal
in another. Escalus tells Pompey that if
he comes to judgment again he will be
whipped, and the cunning scoundrel replies:
“I thank your Worship for your good coun-
sel,” adding in a humorous aside —-“but
I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune
shall better determine.” There is good fun
in the wine-besotted comedy of Caliban
with Trinculo and Stephano (in “The Tem-
pest"), but the figure of Caliban is so
genuinely pathetic that it is with somewhat
twisted amusement we perceive the monster's
intoxication.
Shakespeare’s drunkards were formed to
tickle the groundlings, and afford himself
some comic relief to intersperse, the sad.
magnificent themes of his glorious genius.
But those who quote the spirit of Stratford
as an advocate of self-indulgence probably
are farthest from the thoughts that inspired
the children of his brain. None the less he
was “a handsome, well-shaped man. verie
good company, and of a verie ready, pleasant
and smooth wit,’’and there is a tradition that
his end was hastened by the hospitable en-
tertainment he bestowed on Ben Jonson and
Drayton, who visited him shortly before his
last illness; it is reasonable to suppose that
lie sometimes, at least, joined sociably ir
the general intemperance of those genin'
times.
ABUNDEL DENE.
America through Indian Eyes
A modest booklet entitled “So This Is
America !” comes from Bombay. It is writ-
ten by Budha Jawan, presumably an Indian
student, or maybe a business man, but in
either case a shrewd observer. He sees in
the U.S.A. the nation of the future; bul
its time is not yet. “So much as they are
a nation at present,” he sums up, “it is a
nation of cranks and overdoers.”
As we have it on good authority that
manners make the man, the author com-
mences with a few comments on that sub-
ject. The Americans have their etiquette with
regard to hats quite distinct from that of
the Englishman. “If you take your hat
off on entering a business man’s office,” he
notes, “except for such occasions as you
would also remote your overcoat, you are
an unmannerly country bumpkin. If you
expose your naked head to the public gaze
in an hotel lounge, your best friend wall
not be seen speaking to you. On the other
hand, all sorts and conditions of men-passen-
gers uncover at the entry of a woman into
a public elevator. And should you meet a
lady friend in the street the ‘doggy’ thing
is to remain hat in hand the whole time you
are speaking to her, although I don't say
this is common. From this and other things
I have formed the impression that much
of America’s manners, public and private,
has been picked up at the movies.”
From manners he passes to meals. “A
typical average business dinner (called
‘supper’ and taken about 6) might he soup
with very salt crackers, followed by beef
stew, potatoes, bread and butter, iced salad
and hot coffee, all these last being served
together. After these, a slice of pie or
pudding, called ‘dessert.’ Or possibly that
monstrosity ‘pie a la mode,’ a slice of hot
fruit-pie surmounted by an ice-cream. In
the course of this meal a man may drink up
to half a gallon of water.” The lounge or
entrance hall of an American hotel is in
effect a public room. “Men will come in.
sit down, chew half a meditative cigar and
go out again, doubtless having come to a
decision about something.”
He regards American railways as “more
un-English than any other institution.” The
track he frankly condemns as “damnable.”
also the American system of having to stand
in a queue “on the station concourse, facing
a cage-gate that is opened only five minutes
before the train leaves.” The one thing he
praises without reserve is the baggage-check
system : and the one bright spot in a long jour-
ney is furnished by the colored porter, who
brings round to each Pullman lady-passenger
a paper bag in which to protect her hat from
the dust. Urban transit is conducted with
a minimum of convenience and a maximum
of risk. “You tumble on to the car dizzy
with the excitement of catching it. The
doors bang, the car starts with such a sweep
as makes holding on almost of no avail,
the entire company stare, and the conductor,
sitting willi arms akimbo, chewing, on a seat
near the door, looks at you expectantly. Your
move is to produce the fare required on that
particular tram, and drop it iu a tin box
with a glass front near by before finding a
scat.” Motor-cars arc everywhere, they cost
so little—“round about a month’s salary.”
Even the peddler uses one; "it is no uncom-
mon thing for him to beckon urgently to you,
stop his machine and vigorously endeavor
to interest you in a new line of shoes, or
even mechanical toys.”
“You meet,” says Budlia, “the full general
stare everywhere. The practice is simply
appalling to those from older countries,-
especially from India and the East; but
like spitting at your feet or past your eyes,
no offence is meant.” Spitting is almost
universal. “Men chew tobacco, women and
some men chew gum, and many find it neces-
sary to ‘void their phlegm’ at frequent inter-
vals. A beautifully turned-out and well-
educated girl will roll a piece of gum be-
tween her front teeth while talking to you.”
In hotel lounges, railroad cars and business
offices and waiting-rooms are hundreds of
cuspidors, “mighty brass vessels with un-
covered tops, about the size of a large sauce-
pan.”
“America is a mass of law r . Worse still,
conflicting law', 50 codes of it, one for each
State and one for the Supreme Court.” As
an American citizen remarked to him, “You
can do anything in the States if you can
‘sell it to the public.’ ” From his tenth
birthday up the young American “handles
his personal publicity campaign like a
master.” Whatever the young gentleman
may do he “takes care he is never reported
as saying anything that would not create
missionary enthusiasm in a crowd of arch-
angels.” If you can only “put off on the
public a reputation on paper” you may slip
through many meshes of the law. “A natural
prostitute plays on the variegated divorce
law’s as on a piano.”
“The amount of money the reputedly hard
business man will expend on simple amuse-
ment is astonishing.” Outside his own busi-
ness rut he “is not very intelligent, and his
judgment is as weak as his reserve.” On
the w’hole Budlia prefers the skilled manual
worker, for, “usually as well educated as
the business man, he has a vastly more in-
telligent interest in the world of men and
things, and is as a rule a far pleasanter com-
panion.” The bank and the banker are not
looked upon with the grave respect accorded
to them in Europe and the East. “His is
on the level with other businesses, such as
window’-cleaning and catering, and he gets
neither privilege nor politeness.”
Budlia thinks the American a much poorer
manufacturer than he has got the world to
believe he is. He can’t make safety-matches
or boot-polish for sour apples, and cannot
now’ nor ever could make decent liquor. “One
of the mightiest bluffs in the world is con-
tained in the hard-ridden business word ‘ser-
vice.’ English, French and German manu-
facturers give service, in many cases more
than you get in the States. But they don’t
call it ‘service’; they don’t call it anything;
they just do it as ordinary practice. Yet
the man in the street listens to the American
preaching ‘service’ and envies a business
system in which the customer seems to get
so much for his money.”
So this pilgrim from the East thinks that
America, like" its wine, wants maturing. It
is new’, heady and without bouquet. The
label on the bottle is the best part of it.

A Satchel of Books
Caravans by Bight, by Harry Hervcy (Thornton
Butterworth). Jewels worth millions are stolen from
the palace at Baroda. By chance a scrap of in-
criminating paper comes into the hands of a charming'
Englishwoman. By skilful management she has the
elucidation of the mystery and the rescue of the
stolen treasure placed in the hands of a young military
doctor, and the reader then enters on a series of
adventures and intrigues that are made not only
enthralling but, by reason of their Thibetan environ-
ment, picturesque also.
Beau Geste , by Captain Percival C. Wren (John
Murray). One of the successes of the year, having
run to many impressions before it reached Australia.
The success is better deserved than some others.
The author has already followed the tracks of the
Foreign Legion very successfully. This time he has
in his sometimes crude but always direct way devel-
oped a thrilling yarn, with twin mysteries, one of
which is held until very near the end, while the
other is only revealed in the last few pages.
Save Australia, by Dr. James Barrett (Macmillan).
The American Museum of National History iu its
annual report for 1921 said: “We are approaching
the close of the Age of Mammals all over the world,
but in no continent has the devastation been more
rapid than that of Australia, owing to deforestation,
an enormous fur trade, and an increasing leather
trade” ; and it was pointed out that, forseeing the
possible evanishment of our indigenous fauna, the
American Museum had made special efforts to secure
a representative collection. Some figures quoted in
the report are instructive. The fur-trade’s toll during
the years 1919-21 was as follows: —
Australian ’possums . . 4,265,621 skins
Ring-tailed ’possums .. 1,321,625 ~
Koala .. •• •• 208,677 „
Wallaby .. ■ • • • 1,722
This makes a total of 5,797.645 fur skins ripped
from the Australian bush. And these figures do not
exhibit the full extent of the slaughter. Among the
many pests and enemies we have introduced into our
once comparatively clean country are the rabbit and
the f<jx. The one destroys the grass bv which the
marsupial lives and the other seizes him for food.
In the case of our birds we have also before us the
paradox that whilst some of our most useful natives,
inasmuch as they are the enemies of pestilent insect
life are shot indiscriminately, we have introduced
some dubious visitors who have become permanent
and undesirable settlers. Nor is it much less para-
doxical that we should have to receive at the hands
of English publishers this latest of Dr. Barrett s
works—“A Plea for the Right Use of Our Flora and
Fauna.”
Books and Crooks, by H. R. McDuffie (N.S.W.
Bookstall Oo.)- The average person would lie loath
to make the acquaintance in the flesh of Snork.v
.Tephson, beer cadger, petty thief and central character
in this collection of amusing and ingeniously con-
structed short stories; but on the printed page readers
will follow with interest the schemes and wiles he
adopts to divorce various confiding citizens from
their rolls of banknotes. And, as the last story of
the book proves, he has at least the makings of a
brave gentleman.

whether, going deeper, he compares

He recognises the car’s fundamental

The Barren Peak.
They climbed Olympus to the utmost peak,
Their raw-hide sandals frozen on the snow.
Eager, yet full of terrors, they would know
Of that sure thing they toiled so far to seek.
The hands upon each crucifix were weak,
The monstrous forms of mist passed to and
fro;
But nothing godlike did the mountain show,
Only the stark crags standing bare and bleak.
Then they returned with joy to Tempe’s vale,
Warm with the knowledge that great Zeus
was dead
And Christ triumphant o'er an ancient lie;
But. even as they smiled, a scented gale
Blew over Ossa and a glory spread,
Filled with a laughter that could never die.

Leaps betwixt our eyes!

Hark the god-like voices crying,

Here is power, here is passion !
Then shall Age presume
To carve the ultimate perfection
Round about his tomb?
Meet our eyes re-lit with wonder!
Touch our lips of red!
Yours is perfect beauty truly—
Perfect, marbled, dead.
Lead him gently, gently, gently,
Age, our honored guest;
Give him peace and dreams to ponder,
Wisdom, love and rest.
Then, come Youth! Come Youth, and plunder
Ignorance and truth!
Call down Jove’s eternal thunder—
Youth! Come Youth! Come Youth!
Cruel Youth! and cruel kindness
Come! we may not stay !
Time sings on. Hark to the music!

Ghosts.
Lay me a course to an island lonely
Out where the trade-winds blow
And the sea and the clouds and the moun-
tains only
Welcome the morning’s glow,
Or pale when the pallid night comes wanly,
Bending her shoulders low—
I’m going back to an island lonely,
Back to a dream I know.
There will be lips that I love to welcome;
I will hear footsteps dim
Down where the shining sands and shell come
Close to the waters’ rim.
And words like the notes of a muted bell
come
Soft as an angel’s hymn :
There will be lips that I love to welcome,
Warm ’neath the starlight dim.
Sweet is the course, though it leads us only
Out where the trade-winds blow,
Seeking an isle that is always lonely
Whether the hot noons glow
Or the whispering night, like a ghost comes
wanly,
Stooping her shoulders 10w....
But the lips and the love and the isle are
only
Shadows of dreams, I know.

The standing maize was ripe, the cobs turned
down
To cheat the cockatoos and keep the grain
From rotting in the winter wind and rain.
Great waggons now have carried it to town ;
1 trace their laboring course by many a spill.
Nothing but straw is left, spread thinly out;
A mist has settled on the littered earth,
Stript bare. I think the soil must grieve at
this.
Having so bravely borne, the fruit to miss.
The cold wind whistles with an elfin mirth
Blowing the stalks and withered leaves about.
Such is my heart, a desolate places and bare,
From whence achievement ebbs where hope is
faint.
My sun has vanished and the air is chill:
Ambition cannot lire my languid will,
Words have grown meaningless. No colors
paint
Pictures for me and blight is everywhere.
A sword of silver sweeps the mists apart:
And down the shining way a sweating team
Draws the slow plough. A message! Soul
be fain !
Spring is at hand! Endeavor once again
Will bring achievement. Lo, the evil dream—
Futility—is driven from the heart!
QUEENSLAND.

IS THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT?
“Lacking support, the New York syndicate which
floated the Australian loan was dissolved on Monday.
Bonds, which heretofore have been selling round the
offered price of 991, broke two points on the Exchange
on Monday.”— Cablegram.
That unpretentious item may signify that
the end of the great loan-drunk dream, which
had to come some day, is just round the
corner. Or it may mean not the absolute
finish, but a great reduction, and the start-
ing of life afresh on a humbler scale, after
the manner of the man who has dissipated a
mansion and resumes the thread of existence
in a hut. As it is the foreign (or gold) end
of the orgy which is threatened more than
the local (or paper) end, the result should
include a healthy shock to the importing
craze, and to the haughty importer, who is
now breaking his heart in the foreign-trade
press about the alleged increase in the price
of the housewife’s towel. Loan figures for
1924-25 are not yet. available, but this is
how the six States burdened the back of
the money-lending camel during six four-
yearly periods to June, 1924 :
Addition to State (Peace) Debts.
1900-1904. . £32,520,206 I 1912-1916.. £82,929,687
1904-1908.. 15,587,877 | 1916-1920.. 72,289,076
1908-1912.. 31,648,595 | 1920-1924.. 165,261,640
When another year’s figures are available, a
few weeks hence, they are expected to reveal
t:hat the position has grown still worse. And
as the debt grew faster so grew the arrogance
of strike-leaders and Communists and Red
revolutionaries, who took the vision for real
wealth all ready to be looted; so grew also
the credulity of their easy dupes, who thought
that the influx was inexhaustible, and that
toil was in a fair way to become superfluous.
* * * *
When the floor gave way under the Aus-
tralian borrowers’ feet in Great Britain
(though not necessarily quite past repair),
and a resort to Uncle in New York was sug-
gested, the situation didn’t imply any general
loss of confidence among the British people.
The British loan machine has been made
so perfect that confidence lasts long, even
confidence in people who have ceased to pay
the interest (due in gold) on their old loans
except out of the proceeds of new loans. It
is only necessary to approach the firm or
group which looks after foreign or Crown
Colony or Dominion borrowings, put before
it a proposition which isn’t absolutely ridi-
culous, and assure it of the usual commis-
sion. These principals subdivide the liability
among a multitude of financial “tied houses,'’
allotting to each its agreed-on percentage,
and assure them of the usual commission;
and the “tied houses” trade off the bonds
among clients. But however perfect the
machine might be it ran short of oil. The
trouble may be put into three propositions:
Under the played-out Freetrade system, the im-
ports from countries with cheaper or better or more
industrious labor, or with better machinery or depreci-
ated currencies, have come to exceed in a dreadful
fashion the exports which are supposed to pay for
them. The surplus of imports in Britain was lately
stated (in the S. M. Herald, of all places!) as
150 million pounds’ worth in 1913, as 203 millions’
worth in 1923, and as 395 millions’ worth for the
year to May, 1925. As a consequence, the lack
of employment was described by the same writer in
the same unlooked-for publication as “unique.”
A great income used to come into Britain from
investments abroad and from services rendered abroad
—sea carrying and other things. This paid for the
surplus of imports over exports, and left a big
balance to lend. Britain’s surplus of foreign imports
is much larger now, and the foreign income with
which to pay for them is very much smaller, and is
quite insufficient. The nest-egg, which had been
growing for a century, has shrunk, and no longer
resembles that of the late lamented epyornis, guaran-
teed to hold 2} gallons. It is more of the domestic-
hen variety. When J. Bull’s old investments are
being realised upon for everyday needs, a lack of
surplus money for new investments is natural.
The British National Debt appears to have started
to grow again, in a fluctuating way, which has never
been the habit of the Old Man in London during
peace years. At least, the total was set down as
larger in 1922 than in 1921, and larger in 1923
than ,in 1922, though lost ground was regained in
1924. These narrow circumstances supply further
reason for not lending much at present, even to
Stanley M. Bruce, for he is a hard man to satisfy,
and the Commonwealth’s own Federal debt in London
keeps growing after a fashion which is frankly
horrible. An addition of £20,000,000 in 21 months
is the latest official report.
* * * *
The British Government didn’t shut down
officially on the issue of Crown Colony loans
in its depleted money market; having un-
limited powers of regulation, that was un-
necessary. But it has lately shooed foreign
cadgers off the premises, and it is stated
on good authority that it intimated to the
hungriest of the Dominions that for an in-
definite and uncertain period their room
would be preferred to their company. This
pointed straight to the New York dollar
mart. But the United States never made a
habit of foreign loans for public works, as
Great Britain did. This is partly because
it has territories of its own, almost the
equal of Europe for size, to invest in. It
has lent to Canada, but demands from that
quarter are moderate, and it hardly regards
Canada as foreign. There is no perpetual-
motion lending-machine in the republic, and
evidently a fresh syndicate has to be got
together for each loan. The cable about the
dissolution of the one which financed the re-
cent Federal loan is vague, but it doesn’t
suggest permanency. Despite two mucli-
bragged-about loans to Queensland (a mere
£2,600,000 at over 64 per cent., with sinking
fund conditions) the U.S. financiers appear
to have intimated very clearly that they have
no great desire to lend save on the guarantee
of the whole Commonwealth. It takes some
time for a stranger to grow accustomed to
the idea of a single State, a mere one in a
group of six, which owes twice as much as
the Argentine Republic, doubles its debt in
ten years, has practically no sinking fund,
and owns a Government of semi-Communist
tendencies—to grow accustomed to it, that
is, as a new debtor to be cultivated
in a large way. The just-arrived N. S.
Wales _ Government scorns the idea of
doing its loan business under the Common-
wealth guarantee, as that arrangement would
give the Commonwealth a right to limit its
borrowing activities, which, it holds, should
be as untrammelled as the wild goat on the
mountain peak. Still, the Premier states that
he has arranged for loans to the amount of
£10,000,000 per annum, all on his own.
About that all The Bulletin has to remark
for the moment is that it is a big amount
for a new Premier to arrange so suddenly
without stirring from his office, that there is
a remarkable lack of information about the
source of the money, and that inquiries lead
to nothing.
* * * #
It is satisfactory to know that some
—in fact, a considerable part—of the
public debt is invested in reproductive works.
But, however reproductive they may be of
paper-money, that helps not the least to pay
interest in gold on some £500,000,006 of out-
side debt; and Treasurer Page’s beautiful
paper surpluses only help to occasionally re-
duce the local debt, which is of minor im-
portance. The ruinous and, at best, only
temporary device of floating new foreign
loans to pay interest on old ones can only
be obviated by reducing imports till the sur-
plus of exports is sufficient to cover that in-
terest, and it would be well if the surplus
was large enough to reduce principal as well.
One method of reduction would be for the
Commonwealth to take, at market value, the
requisite amount of exportable produce, and
sell it abroad for the requisite amount of
real money. With this it could meet its
own gold liability and that of any States
which consented to sign the joint borrowing
agreement and swear off foreign money
markets. There would thus be perhaps
£20,000,000 of exports which would come
back in the shape of an honestly receipted
bill, and not in the shape of motor-cars,
petrol and women’s fluff. The importer
might rage, but the manufacturer and the
artisan would benefit, and the man who sup-
plied the produce would be paid as he is now,
in paper. There might be some struggle in
adjusting things to the changed conditions,
but a struggle doesn’t improve by keeping.
If a policy of drift means leaving the crisis
to be tackled by some Tom Walsh-y Govern-
ment which succeeds Bkuce the outlook will
be poor.
LATAH.
There is a disease prevalent in the East
Indian islands called latah. It manifests
itself in an uncontrollable impulse to imi-
tate. The will temporarily abdicates, and
the person afflicted is for the moment a
cloud, a wave or any other object that has
excited his attention. A latah victim, taken
off his guard, will imitate the swaying of
a tree-branch until he becomes exhausted
or a passer-by shakes him out of his trance.
It is only necessary for the ribald small
boy to go through a pantomime undressing
for the sufferer to strip himself in actual
fact, and there is a story of a wayfarer,
startled by the advent of a tiger, exchanging
leap for leap with .the marauder, until the
astounded animal decided that discretion was
the better part and made off into the jungle.
* * * *
Although the disease has been considered
peculiar to the Malays there are indications
that it has a wider spread. It may even
be suspected of being endemic in every coun-
try. A year or so ago woman’s hair was
considered to be her crowning glory. The
fair creature who could sweep the ground
behind her with her flowing locks was the
envy of her fellows; the woman who lost
her hirsute halo in an attack of fever was
constrained to hide her shameful deficiency
under a wig. Exactly when the first shingle,
its photograph in the society magazines or
the cabled report of its appearance in the
Park, arrived in Australia is not recorded;
but with a unanimity that was like the
springing to attention of a vice-regal guard
of honor, the oriflamme of womanhood went
tumbling to the ground. Even venerable old
ladies added their last sad grey hairs to
the sacrificial pyre. With an equal lack
of rational excuse skirts soar momentarily
above the knees, and then descend to the
heels again. This slavish obedience to what
are called the dictates of fashion, although
the original dictator has never been defi-
nitely located, is not confined to women.
About 20 years ago a narrow-trouser vogue
for men attacked the country. The bifur-
cated garment became so skimpy that accusa-
tions were made that the things had been
sewn on the most - extreme exponents, and
that they were unable to remove them when
they Wanted to go to bed. Lately a type of
trouser modelled on an elephant’s hind leg
broke out-in Oxford, and the infection is
now raging among public-schoolboys in this
country. Besides these epidemics there is
evidence that the disease in a mild form is
always with us. An inelegant, insanitary
and unventilated male hat, which was appa-
rently evolved in a cold and cloudy country
where its deleterious effects are not so mani-
fest:. is worn daily by millions of uncom-
plaining latahs; and wealthy latahs pay
large sums for unintelligible nonsense in
paint because highbrow latahs have repeated
the nonsense that latah art critics have writ-
ten about it. If Kreisler had disguised
himself as a street musician and played his
Guarnerius outside the Sydney Town Hall on
his opening night, it is reasonably certain
that nine-tenths, of the musical latahs would
have swept past him up the steps with their
noses in the air.
* * * *
Under ordinary conditions latah is a disease
that takes protean shapes. There are capi-
talist latahs and communist latahs. There
are trade-union latahs in whom the complaint
takes the form of periodic rigors known as
strikes. These are excellent examples of
the disease, since during the period of the
seizure the individual hands over to his
leaders his entire volition and only resumes
control of his actions when the exciting
agent is removed. There are, in addition,
instances of whole nations going latah. When
Napoleon held up before the French his
dream of military glory, the entire nation
promptly offered its heart’s blood. A more
recent example was the German people. The
model presented to them for imitation was
the joint production of scientists, philologists,
a mad philosopher and a paranoic king. It
was called the Superman, and beggars, trades-
unionists, parsons, poets and linen-drapers
marched gladly to death, believing them-
selves to be Nietzschean blonde beasts. The
latest outbreak has occurred in Russia, where
a little Jew with a lust for blood complicated
by a cold and calculating brain became the
exemplar for a whole nation of illiterate
simpletons. Mankind is also subject to
accesses of religious latah in which inspired
sensualists like Mahomet become the pat-
terns.
* * * *
Nevertheless, the consequences of the dis-
ease are not entirely bad. It might, in fact,
be argued that the good done by it far out-
weighs the evil. The spectacle of a sub-
urban street lined with standardised brick
houses all set exactly 20 feet from the front
fence because the council regulations say
they must not be set less than 20 feet from
the front fence may incite the individualist
to scornful laughter; so may the spectacle
of the householder spending his week-ends
making his oblong patch of lawn as trim as
his next-door neighbor’s, while leaving his
back yard to tins and weeds; or Miss Brown,
the hodman’s daughter, spending half her
parent’s wages in silk stockings in imitation
of Miss Jones, the butcher’s daughter. These
forms of the complaint alleged to be peculiar
to the Malay are obscure aspects of the work-
mg of evolution. Education is a process
of infecting the rising generation with lataii
so that they shall be better instructed than
the last. Patriotism is a national form oi'
the disease which, while it may drive an ill-
balanced people to perdition, is the only
means whereby a healthy nation can be pre-
served. The problem of a democracy, whicli
consists of a whole countryful of latahs who
periodically select their own exemplars by
popular vote, is to find some means of ensur-
ing that, the models chosen shall be worthy
of imitation, instead of scoundrels or uncouth
crooks.
THE MAINTENANCE AND MANAGE-
MENT OF HOSPITALS.
With a fall in contributions through the
usual channels and a rise in costs of all
kinds, hospitals in England as well as Aus-
tralia are having a cold time, and their com-
mittees and governors are at their wits’ end
to devise new schemes to keep the wards
open. So a “Statement Concerning Hospital
Matters in Britain” comes at an opportune
moment; and it is of such quality that it
may be studied with profit by the managers
of nearly all charities.
The “Statement,” of 74 pages, was pri-
marily intended for the information of the
Melbourne and Alfred hospitals, with which
the authors, George Fairbairn and Arthur
Baillieu, are associated; but it should have
a much wider audience than that, since it
treats of questions that have agitated the
medical mind for 30 years or so. Prominent
among these is the question of private
paying patients in public hospitals—in
Britain, “voluntary hospitals”—which has
long been fought over. Medical opinion is
almost unanimously against the procedure
in Australian metropolitan hospitals; but in
the country districts practitioners have been
forced at times to take paying patients into
the wards of public hospitals owing to lack
of facilities elsewhere. And country commit-
tees, being wise, have held their tongues
about the infringement of the rules, and haw
been satisfied with getting additional revenue
without in any way penalising the sick poor.
At last Britain has decided to do likewise,
and the wards of some of the largest hos-
pitals in London make provision for the
treatment of private paying patients. Their
policies differ in details considerably. Guy’s
and King’s College, for example, insist upon
paying patients being treated by members of
their own staffs, to the great grief of the
general practitioner. St. Thomas’s, more
liberal, has established a “nursing home” in
its own grounds (42 beds), with a resident
medical officer, an operating room, and other
facilities; and if patients are not satisfied
with the resident doctor they may make
their own arrangements with any physician
or surgeon in consulting practice.
In Britain—and largely it is the same in
Australia —it appears to be not so much the
depletion of pockets as a change in the
nation’s psychology that has caused the fall-
ing off in subscriptions to deserving chari-
ties ; at any rate, with the stimulus of a
substantial monetary prize to be won in a
ballot, funds to the hospitals still come roll-
ing in. We had long known from the appeals
of Viscount Knutsford, “Prince of Beg-
gars,” that the London Hospital in particu-
lar was in a parlous state; but the latest
“stunt,” which had the imprimatur of the
recently-formed British Charities’ Associa-
tion, with the Viscount as chairman, brought
the fact home with additional force. In the
first competition, to which Bovril, Ltd., con-
tributed £30,000 and guaranteed all exes.,
and which brought in a net profit of over
£75,000, the most attractive posters of that
company had to be voted for. The Daily
Mail followed the example of Bovril, Ltd.,
and offered prizes of £25,000, provided the
paper was allowed to name the competition.
And, at latest, St. Thomas’s was conducting
yet another ballot. But all this is utterly un-
satisfactory, and there are thousands of phil-
anthropic workers who must feel that much
of the money now being raised for charities
is got by something perilously like false pre-
tences.
Owing to the hard times amalgamations
also have been in the air—a step that a few
years ago would have been undreamt of, for
each hospital was jealous of its independence
and resented any interference with its man-
agement. The tendency now is for a general
hospital which runs one or more special
departments to keep a look-out for a special
hospital that is tottering for want of sup-
port, and to snap it up and make use of il
as a convenient place to transfer cases. In
this way the Royal Northern Hospital (200
beds) has absorbed the Royal Chest Hospital
(SO beds), and University College Hospital
has taken over the Royal Ear Hospital,
which it uses as a Nose, Ear and Throat
Department. Similarly Hampstead General
Hospital has absorbed the North-West
London Hospital, and other amalgamations
are talked of.
If the practice of admitting paying
patients to the big hospitals were adopted
in Australia, Messrs. Fairbairn and Bail-
Uieu suggest that there would be no need
for those intermediate hospitals for which
the high fees charged in private hospitals
provoke a sporadic agitation. As to fees
for this service, Guy's Hospital charges five
guineas per -week (paid in advance) ; but
if patients are not satisfied with the atten-
tion provided for this money they may make
their own pecuniary arrangements with a
member of the visiting staff. At King’s
College Hospital a single room costs eight
guineas per week; the cost for a double
cubicle in a ward (the cubicle is screened
off by curtains) is five guineas. If the
patient decides to be attended by a member
of the visiting staff the house governor has
the settling of the fees. The doctor _ is
paid according to the number of paying
patients he has in the wards. This method
has been copied from Leeds, where they
have an intermediate hospital. The much-
criticised (and abused) experiment at Brad-
ford, the Municipal Hospital, known as St.
Luke’s, is not attractive. It has a staff of
10 who draw an “honorarium” of £SOO per
annum each, and are expected to look sharp
if they get a call when on duty. Every
ratepayer in Bradford is eligible for admis-
sion, and as the hospital contains 750 beds
there is usually no delay in getting admis-
sion. The rules have been lately altered ; now


each patient is expected to pay 9s. pep diem,
which includes everything. The bills aie
sent out by the City Treasurer, who will give
Ul Ediui)uS Royal Infirmary, which was
the first hospital to have a Tuberculosis lie-
partment, is again a pioneer with the 1 let-
arv Department. This is well worth Aus-
tralia’s attention. The department is m
the hands of a former ward sister, who
teaches the inmates—diabetes patients tor
example—how to prepare, the proper diets
for tlieir maladies, and instructs them in
the use of insulin, etc. The Edinburgh
authorities say they would not be without it,
and a similar department in our large hos-
pitals would cut down expenses considerably.
The Almoner system is comparatively new
and is declared to be a great success. The
Institute of Hospital Almoners was tormed
in 1907, but only lately has it boomed. Can-
didates get two years’ training, part of the
time in a Charities Organisation Office and
part of the time in the Out-patients’ Depart-
ment. They are really social and after-care
workers, though some are called upon to
inquire into the patients’ finances. Their
salaries vary from £IOO to £350 per annum.
But finance in most of the big institutions
is left in the hands of the inquiry officer,
and the Almoners are thus free to visit the
homes of patients with a view to getting
them to carry out the instructions given by
their medical attendants at the hospital.
For one thing, they see that children who
have been operated upon for enlarged ton-
sils and adenoids get a little after-attention.
The status of the Poor Law infirmaries
lias improved vastly; they are now allowed
to make a charge to patients, and even to
admit private paying patients. Lambeth
Infirmary, the largest, has 1600 beds. Ihe
National Insurance system has had its effect
on the Out-patients’ Department; the num-
ber of trivial accidents and minor medical
cases treated there lias notably decreased,
while the number of in-patients lias in-
creased, because the “panel” doctor packs
his patient off to the nearest hospital when-
ever lie can. With the introduction of the
“panel” system most of the glamor of medi-
cal practice in London has departed ; doctors
who have lists of a couple of thousand must
long for their old independence —they have
precious little time for study in the new
order of things, which they owe to the W elsh

The League Meets.
Foe the sixth time since the outbreak of
the Peace the League of Nations’ full Assem-
bly is exercising its lungs. Turbans, fezes,
kopeias, yashmaks and other exotic head-
dresses are thronging the hotels of Geneva;
and soon the casinos will be full of groups
busily intriguing, votes will be exchanged for
concessions over the teacups, and the find-
ings of the august concourse of delegates
speaking a score of tongues will be referred
to committees and sub-committees before
being enshrined in the League’s already vast
library of archives. A pathetic figure in the
bizarre spectacle is Mrs. Woodrow Wilson,
wife of the man who started it. Meantime,
heard but dully above the chatter, machine-
guns are rattling in Morocco, where France
and Spain are settling their argument with
the Riffs in the ancient way, with Germany
and other European nations making it as
hard for them as possible, also in the ancient
way; the Druses, ostensibly taking instruc-
tion in the art of self-government at the
hands of France under a mandate from the
League, are birching their teachers; Turkey
is claiming Mosul because it is Turkish ter-
ritory, and Britain retains it because it is
rich in oil; there are rumors of great expan-
sion of armaments in the air, where Germany
already has the commercial supremacy, which
in time of war means the military
supremacy; Russia has come back to Asia
in her old role of rival imperialist to Britain,
her advent synchronising with anti-foreign,
riots and a boycott of British goods
in China and restlessness in India and
Persia; and, the enormous natural re-
sources of China being essential to
Japan’s further expansion and the Asiatic
open door being necessary to Uncle Sam’s
manufacturers, these two are measuring the
distance that fortunately lies between them
and making big increases in their military
and naval budgets in order to shorten it.
Plenty more manifestations in other parts
of the world may be found of a preference
among the nations for arbitration, concilia-
tion, the pacific settlement of international dis-
putes by means of protocols and similar docu-
ments, a fairly comprehensive list of which
may be obtained from the columns of any
morning’s newspaper. It would be difficult,
in fact, to find a country anywhere that does
not passionately favor the ideals propounded
by Dr. Wilson, and it would be equally diffi-
cult to find one that is not keeping its powder
dry. Siam, in the popular mind a country
largely of legend, is a case in point. This
kingdom owes its independence entirely to
the fact that it serves as a buffer State be-
tween Britain’s Farther India and France’s
Indo-Cliina. At one time it had a
busy little imperialism of its own, ruling
the miserable little Malay States with great
brutality on the one hand and looting the
placid Cambodians very thoroughly on the
other. After the two big European Powers
had snipped the native empire down to its
present dimensions, it was left in peace, and
prospered mightily without feeling the need
for military safeguards. But lately, owing
to .Japanese spread and Chinese uppishness
under Bolshevik instigation, Siam has begun
to see elements of impermanence in the im-
perialisms of France and Britain. While
therefore, it continues to send its delegates
to the League of Nations, it has not refrained
from tightening up its own right arm; and
it is now reported by foreign experts to have
the largest; and most efficient air force in
Asia.
New Crews for Idle Ships.
It is time the British seamen on strike in
Australia against their own great unions
realised that the owners are not going to
keep their vessels laid up in these harbors
indefinitely at a cost of from £SOO down-
wards per day. Neither the Seamen s union
in Britain nor the Trades Union Congress
recognises this strike; therefore, it is quite
open for British unionists to take the jobs
that the seamen have been misled into refus-
ing. Now, it has to be remembered that
there is over a million tons of shipping idle
in Britain, which means that there must be
many tens of thousands of maritime workers
out of a job and looking for one. That sooner
or later they will be offered the job of man-
ning these ships in* Australia is inevitable,
if indeed crews for some of them are not on
the water already. The men will come with
their union tickets to accept a job which
the British unions tell them they have a
perfect right to take; indeed, since the men
in Australia are defying their unions, the
latter will certainly assist good unionists to
take the places of those who are m rebellion
against the unions’ authority. No amount
of sympathy for the men in having to put
up with a cut in their poor wages will then
save their jobs: and they may take it as
a foregone conclusion that_ when their old
ships steam away with union crews public
interest in them will die out, and instead of
being strikers they will be merely penniless
unemployed. And the position of the mari-
time unionists in Australia will certainly
be none the better for the presence of 3000
or so extra men competing for their jobs.
Other unions are concerned in this matter.
None of them will be the better for this con-
siderable body of men being thrown suddenly
on the Australian labor market. If they
don’t want to see it happen they had better
bestir themselves and consider where the
private quarrel \ of Tom Walsh with the
chiefs of the British Seamen’s Union is
landing them.

Applause in the Wrong Place.
For the lightest whim —sometimes without
any whim at all that can be discerned—a
union which controls a vital industry or
service will down tools and so inconvenience
a multitude of innocent people in no way a
party to the dispute, actual or supposed.
The stoppage will have the approval—taking
apathy as ta_cit consent—of political Labor.
There is immediate upheaval: shortage of
tucker, transport, temper and common ameni-
ties of life. The appointed guardians of the
innocent and wronged-—the Government of
the day—after a period of backing, filling and
vituperation, make an attempt to bring order
into 'chaos by restoring the tucker, transport
and temper supplies. According to the mea-
sure of its leaders it tries cajolery or coer-
cion. Instantly official Labor raises a great
and piteous cry that all would be well if
the Government would only keep out
—that Labor officials are courting brain-
fever trying to effect a settlement of
the dispute, and that _ interference by
anyone not Laborite will undo all the
good work already done and so extend
the trouble that settlement will take years!
A mission to settle the dispute forthwith be-
comes a passion with official Labor; its
efforts simply glow with virtue. Lookers-
on, Pro-Bono-Publicoes, even Government
supporters, beseech the Government to be
careful, to let thtj emissaries of the Trades
Hall see what they can do; not to do any-
thing which may precipitate a crisis; not to
forget the women and children; not to ham-
per self-denying men handling a very ticklish
situation. Official Labor and Trades Halls
are raised to the plane of public saviours.
Newspapers turn squads of men on to watch
their doings and take down their words; the
churches pray for their guidance; gags about
them are introduced into Tivoli patter and
Hugh Ward’s latest revue; they overshadow
in public notice Heroic’s antics at the barrier
and the tariff on long-handled shovels. For
a week or two Labor officials deliberate, the
country standing round on tip-toe, and then
the union goes back to work amid the back-
patting of the men who have theatrically
settled that which, had they started at the
other end, they could have prevented, Several
Labor leaders enjoy a real reputation as
settlers of industrial disputes—the number
of their settlements is blazoned abroad. The
extraordinary thing is that not only does
the public believe in them as tacticians and
industrial saviours, but they believe in them-
selves. If only there were as much virtue
(and kudos) attached to preventing a strike
as to settling one, this country would be a
lot happier.
Fair and Unfair Rents.
In a logical mood the N.S.W. Government
proposes to extend its Fair Rents policy
to include shops and offices, and there is
an idea of applying it also to flats and to
hotels. Perhaps a further development of
logic may bring under its operation those
nominal purchase transactions which are
based on a slender deposit, “balance as
rent.” The Fair Rents Court was estab-
lished, for metropolitan use only, by Hol-
man, in 1915, and was extended to the rest
of the State by Stqrey-Dooley . in 1920.
The habit of putting up little houses for
rental purposes was said to be diminishing
even in 1915, some reasons ascribed being-
increased price of land in and around the
one city worth mentioning, increased cost of
labor (which wouldn’t have mattered if it
hadn’t been accompanied by a diminished
output of work), and increased rates (which
are paid by the owner, whereas the British
idea is to charge them to the occupier, so
that they leave off when there is no occu-
pancy). Another reason, which neither poli-
tical party cared to dwell upon much, was
that the Sydney Government went off its
financial head simultaneously with the
arrival of Holman and McGowen in office,
and proceeded to mop up all the spare
money it could lay its hands on for public
works. It was so eloquent about its bonds
being the best and safest security that the
collection of petty rents went out of favor
as an investment. When scarcity gave a
chance to push rents up, the Government
tried to push them violently down with its
court, and at the same time the Common-
wealth offered rates of interest for more
loans, which made pursuit of the small-
landlord game a mark of lunacy. At latest
advices, N.S.W. and the other States and
the Commonwealth were still hunting with
dogs • and guns for every spare copper
which shows its head above water, and at
the same time N. S. Wales in particular
wants to know more strenuously than ever
why people in general don’t build, for letting
purposes, cottages and terrace homes with
the money which has already gone into 11011-
paying railways. Meanwhile, a substitute
of a sort has been found for the rented cot-
tage. The man with a family, a wage and
a trifle of savings, being tired of the struggle
to rent a decent little home, and more tired
of bang a sub-tenant or one of several sub-
tenants in somebody else’s hired shack, has
a great tendency to pay a deposit, just as
large as can be extracted from him, and
undertake the “balance as rent.” Thus he
becomes a tenant again, with responsibility
for rates, taxes and repairs, with no more
fixity of tenure than is implied in his ability
to keep up the instalments, and quite outside
the orbit of the Fair Rents Court. If
some enthusiastic and logical amendment of
the law makes every agreement which lias
the color of rent equally liable to review it
is difficult to say what may happen, but it
will be something interesting.

“The Naval Critic on the Hearth.”
“Forebridge” : In endeavoring to boost the
four years’ short-service system in vogue in
the American Navy, “Oaractacus,” who
blandly admits that he has only a “limited
acquaintance with naval men” (B. 3/9/’25),
displays an equally limited acquaintance with
naval matters. “There is a native Conserva-
tism about naval men,” he writes} “which
sees in anything savoring of change
a risk of rendering the Navy “useless
as a fighting-machine.” In the last
30 years the ocean-going destroyer, the
battle-cruiser and the super-submarine have
revolutionised naval warfare, and in each
case these new types of warship were first
introduced iu the British Navy. The centre-
line gun, the bulge, the paravane, the depth-
charge and the magnetic mine are all
British naval innovations and inven-
tions, which have since been adopted
by the navies of other countries. In
the face of these facts it is absurd to pre-
tend that the Navy will not tolerate new
ideas. On the contrary, it welcomes them,
provided they aim at increasing the efficiency
of the service. The short-service scheme,
which, incidentally, has been tried and found
wanting, very definitely decreases the effi-
ciency of the service. It did this even when
the recruits spent their entire time (five
years in the R.N.) learning their naval trade
and no other. Torpedoes, semi-automatic
guns, 15-inch turrets, and the rest of the
complicated armament and machinery of a
modern battleship cannot be handled effect-
tively by “laborers.” Pressed men, with no
technical knowledge, were good enough to
man the tackles of the Victory’s muzzle-
loaders or wield a boarding-pike; indeed,
only a very few trained seamen were needed
to work the sails. But to-day every naval
rating must be a highly-trained unit, and in
spite of statements to the contrary, five or
seven years are required to convert a raw
recruit into such a fully-trained and
efficient A.B. Any system which encour-
aged men to join the Navy for less than
seven years is unsound. If a man joins for
only four or five years and elects to leave
at the end of that time, he will
merely have cost the country a lot of money,
for which the country will have had no re-
turn. He cannot even be regarded as a com-
petent naval reservist, for not having com-
pleted his training he will not be a thor-
oughly efficient A.B. Supporters of short-
service systems—incidentally, I have never
met an experienced R.N. or R.A.N. officer
who did support them—assert that if a man
enlists for four years he will probably re-
cnlist, when his time is up, for another four
years or more. In both the R.N. and the
R.A.N. it has been found that this is not
the case; less than 5 per cent, of short-service
recruits volunteer to remain in the Navy.
By advertising the R.A.N. as a technical
training-school for shore trades, and by allow-
ing youths to join for only four years, it
might be possible to obtain a large number
of recruits. But as 95 per cent, of short-
service men already leave the Navy when
their time is up, even when they have not
been taught a shore trade in the service and
have no prospect of getting work on the
“beach,” it is reasonable to presume that
99£ per cent, would do so if the Navy had
eauipped them with a trade which they could
follow. No; the fact is that by establish-
ing such a system in the R.A.N. neither the
recruit nor the service would benefit. In 1916
a certain foreign fleet, manned almost en-
tirely by short-service men, steamed out into
the Atlantic to carry out its annual battle-
practice firing. A fortnight later the fleet
returned to its base without having fired a
gun. The weather had not been too kind,
and the guns’ crews had all been so seasick
that they werp unfit for duty. Fiascos of
this nature, which are of common occurrence
in short-service names, inevitably lead R.N.
arm R.A.N. officers to doubt the truth of
the assertion that “the R.A.N. will not be
any worse off through being well stocked with
short-term men —short-term men are at least
as good as borrowed men or no men at all.”
If Australia really cannot obtain long-service
recruits, who will join the Navy for 15. 20
or 25 years with the object of making it their
life’s profession, then she is in a bad way.
If freak schemes have to be adopted, as in
some foreign navies, to lure unwilling re-
cruits into the service for a few short years,
then the R.A.N. will never justify the money
spent upon it. Fortunately there is no
reason to suppose that this is the case. So
far, no serious efforts have been made to
attract the right type of long-service recruit.
Considering the standard of wages in Aus-
tralia the pay is poor, whilst the unsettled
naval policy of the Commonwealth makes
the prospects uninviting. The R.A.N. has
rather contracted than expanded, and a stag-
nant service will not attract keen and en-
thusiastic recruits. But, most important of
all, there is no pension scheme by which, if
a man serves for 20 years or more, he is re-
warded with an annuity for life. Until long-
service pensions are introduced in the R.A.N.
as they have been in the R.N. and in nearly
every other public service in Australia, the
right type of recruit will not be attracted
to the Navy. Meanwhile it is better to let
things remain as they are than to waste
money in copying the unsuccessful experi-
ments of foreign nations.
Going the hong Way RofuuL
Recent advices from the Wetter iLand indi-
cate that the process of repubbitug the Re-
public is well advanced. “Gin,r says the
Washington Daily News, “which cost $7 a
short quart in Washington three* years ago,
has gradually slid down the sc ale three
and four. Some is even lowejr. Whisky,
which brought from $l2 to $2O, is now from
$6 to $lO. And the following despatch from
the seat of the Dry Administration indicates
that if the supply is good the* demand is
brisk:—
Liquor law violations in the national capital
detected by the Washington police totalled 14,013
in the last fiscal year. Nine thousand and thirteen
persons were arrested for intoxication. The police
took into custody 448 persons for driving automobiles
while under the influence of liquor. The figures for
liquor violations increased 1244 arrests over the
previous fiscal year.
Nor does Washington stand alone. Here is
a statement of the position from Cleve-
land :
Three thousand men and women in Cuyakoga
county are engaged in the business of violating the
prohibition laws for profit. This Industry does an
annual business approximating $151),000,000 in this
county alone. .. . Last year the,. Municipal Court tried
18 348 cases, while the justices and mayors tried
approximately 94,300. Many mayors and justices
have grown rich on the wave of business brought in
by the Volstead Act. One made $150,000 in six
years.
From Nebraska, which is falling behind m
the fight:—
Over 600 alleged bootleggers were in Federal Court
to-day to plead to charges of violating the Prohi-
bition law. Among them were 50 women.
It has long been known that the whole busi-
ness of depubbing the republic had become a
farce as well as a vast vested interest; but
while the dry advocates have admitted that the
attempt to wean the old man from his grog
has definitely failed, they have advanced the
plea that prohibition will justify itself in
the next generation. The children of to-day,
they claim, are growing up in innocence and
ignorance of the insiduous sin. hor anyone
who has not forgotten his own youth, the
quaint argument hardly needs refutation;
but here is the evidence of the Hon. Thomas
Mainland on the position in Colorado:
I saw boys and girls by the dozens drunk. Most
of the down-town drunkenness was confined to the
young people. The older men, the business men,
don’t go out to the bootlegging saloon for their
whisky. They have it sent to their home or their
office. In the hotels, the rooming houses, the bootleg
establishments, I saw youngsters dead drunk night
after night.
A recent cable announced that a tremendous
offensive, in which swift fleets of aeroplanes,
a navy of power-boats and every device of
land-warfare except gas and flamenwerters
will be employed, is to be launched against
the cohorts of illegal liquor. Should the
effort fail, its sponsors regretfully admit
that a modification of the anti-liquor laws
along the lines of Continental cafes vending
light wines and beers is inevitable. Uncle
Sam lias gone a long way round to arrive at
this very obvious destination; Australia will
save herself a lot of trouble and expense if
she takes the short cut there instead of
waiting for a similar reign of terror to show
her the track. __
The People We Meet in Gaol.
According to Tasmania’s director of
psychological clinics (Professor Morris
Miller) the mentality of 117 confinees in
Hobart Gaol has been accurately measured
during the past year, with the follow-
ing result: .Imbeciles, 9; feeble-minded,
25: on the border-line, 36; normal inferior,
21; normal average, 23; normal superior, o.
In a comprehensive report the Professor
gives tables of “intelligence quotients show-
ing that the mental development of the prison
population is considerably below that ot the
general community—nearly three-fifths are
mental deviates of some sort. In regard to
brain measurement 83 per cent, ot the detec-
tives are small-headed; and, in general, brain
capacity shows some positive relation to the
nature and mental grade of the crime. Ibis
relationship is tabulated :
Murder and manslaughter .. 1402 e.e.
Larceny and vagrancy . • 1412 ~
Bex offences .. ■ - • • 1440 ”
Assault, wounding, etc. .. 1456 „
Forgery, uttering .. - • 148 1 „
Burglary, entering .. • • 1493 „
Embezzlement . • • • 1499 „
Sex and violent crimes, as well as petty
thieving, appear generally to go with a brain
capacity below the normal. When the exami-
ners (Professor Miller and Gaol Medical-
officer Dr. Inglis Clark) had completed
their job of measuring up the prisoners,
Superintendent Davies was taken into con-
sultation. He agreed that it was high time
to amend the old gaol classification (based
on number of offences) to something more
suitable to the mental condition and reactions
of the “children in mind.” In January last
this reclassification was put into operation,
so far as the accommodation of the old
Campbell-street Penitentiary permitted; and
the Superintendent now reports that the new
system has resulted in a drop of 68 pel
cent, in the number of gaol offences. It is
suggested, fairly enough, that ,this is ‘ admir-
able testimony to the application of psy-
chology in the discipline of prisoners." Alto-
gether Professor Miller’s report seems to
indicate that the Tas. Mental Deficiency Act
is a very useful and interesting bit of legis-
lation, and the result of the experiments
made under it certainly justify further ex-
periments under better gaol conditions. Inci-
dentally, the report should help to finalise
the years-old proposal to remove the ancient
“Tench” from the heart of Hobart and build
a model gaol in a country district. The
Lyons Government names New Norfolk as
the new site, and, it is understood that the
building will be put in hand directly an
adequate water-supply can be arranged. The
sale of the ancient site, the most valuable
acre in Hobart, will probably go most of
the way towards meeting the cost of the
new establishment.

Railway Sops.
Since the direct line from Horsham to
Hamilton was opened five or six years ago.
the Vic. railway authorities have been “play-

traffic. During portions of three seasons
grain has been transferred by little trains
of about 12 trucks, each containing, say,
2500 3-bushel bags. As a modern ocean
wheat-ship can stow away from 80,000 to
120,000 bags, it requires from 30 to 45 trains
to fill one ship. Hitherto about four trains
daily have been running to Portland, so it
has taken from seven to twelve days to fill
a ship. The miniature trains are due
to the fact that the line is too light for
heavier than “DD” class locomotives to run
upon it. The rails are laid over instead of
through every little hump that comes in the
way—this notwithstanding that, as already
stated, the line was to be a wheat line. The
construction branch of the Vic. railway , sys-
tem is quite distinct from the permanent
working branch. When the Parliamentary
Standing Cominittee on railway construc-
tion approves of a line, the construction
branch gets instructions to make it, after,
of course, the usual delays. The cheapest'
possible mode of construction is followed.
Earthworks are cut down to the irreducible
minimum. Instead of small rises in the
contour of the country being cut through, the
rails are laid over them. The cheapest sort
of timber for sleepers, bridges and culverts
is used. The main "object is to get the line
down and handed over to the working branch
at the lowest possible cost per mile. In
level country with comparatively light traffic
this policy may be right. But for a line for
heavy through traffic, as the Horsham-
Hamilton line was to be, this cheap and
nasty scheme is an utterly foolish one. As
soon as the Department took over this line
expenses for strengthening, renewals and
other work began. The Balmoral to Hamil-
ton section of the line (40 miles) has only
been in existence for six or seven years. Yet
thousands of pounds have already been spent
in renewing rotten sleepers, etc., and all
the time it has required regrading before
any more than the aforesaid toy-trains can
run over it. This will have to be done, and
the traffic carried on at the same time, a
costly proceeding which could have been
avoided had the earthworks been properly
constructed in the first place. And the line is
only an instance. The same fool procedure
goes on, more or less, all over the State. And
the railways’ customers and the general tax-
payer have to pay for it.
-— ' ♦
Thirty-odd years ago a colony of Com-
munists, mostly from Queensland, set forth
to be happy angels in Paraguay. They had
secured from a not-quite-white Government
the gift of a large and fertile estate. They
all had a fair amount of money, for no one
was eligible without it. They were under
the leadership of the first editor of the first
Labor paper in Australia. They left behind
them their share of the aged, sick, imbecile,
physically-incompetent and the public debt.
The colonists degenerated into rags, and the
settlement dissolved in a year or two,
through stop-works and go-slows, through
inability to float foreign loans, and through
the_ lack of an industrious “bourgeoisie”
which could be taxed or thieved from. But
that was some time ago, and the lamp of
faith burns again. Cheered by recent hap-
penings the “Movement” now has go-slow
officials on watch at even the minor Queens-
land ports to see that there is no indulgence
in excessive toil, and the watch being a
trouble and the business not so very large
the inter-State boats already ge,t into the
habit of passing by. Similar tactics, engi-
neered from the same source, practi-
cally closed the port of Darwin some
years ago, and it hasn’t opened much
since. The Cloncurry copper-field,
which stood for more than half the
copper output of Quensland, closed a
while back, if a reduction from 11,625
tons to 325 tons is a closure. Mount
Morgan, which, though it has long
showed a serious loss to the owners,
represented most of the copper and
gold output which remained, suspended
the other day by reason of the
railway strike and the prospect of fewer
working hours and more expenses. There-
upon the local “proletariat” forcibly re-
moved the men who had been retained to
keep things in order with a view to possible
re-opening, and made it a genuine closure.
Queensland possesses twa woollen mills, but
the bigger one was closed by the railway
strike, and the new 44 hours law made it
not worth resuming. The hotels and the
mouth of the Brisbane River remain open,
however.

“Hamer” : One detail in my sketch of Tom
Walsh (B. 3/9/’25) was not correct —I
suggested that the passing out of Arthur
Gibson, Victorian Seamen’s secretary, was
due to Walsh’s resolution barring Masons
from office. Gibson had been elected secre-
tary of the branch a fortnight before the
resolution -was carried, and remained there
for some time before resigning upon a matter
of principle. Balance-sheets showing the
affairs of the union had not been sent to the
branch uor to the Federal Industrial Regis-
trar, and Gibson, after trying to obtain
them, decided that it was impossible to re-
main an officer of an organisation in which
elementary rules of business were unobserved.
Disputes about balance-sheets have been
common events in the union’s recent history;
its last experience was the refusal of a firm
of accountants, after a long attempt to un-
'ravel the tangled accounts (the bill was £167),
to sign a balance-sheet—it was a matter of
impossibility to certify to the position of
affairs, they said. The Walsh attitude is
that it doesn’t matter— Lenin, he once told
an executive inclined to argue the point, was
not asked to account for every pound when
he was organising the Revolution. Without
throwing any suspicion on Walsh’s honesty,
according to his standards, the position of
the Seamen’s Union indicates how muddled
a world this would be under Walsh control:
it helps to explain Russia.

“Master Mariner”: What do the blasts
you hear on Sydney ferries mean? I’ve
been told that one blast signifies “I am going
to pass you port-side to port-side.” I have
even heard a ferry-master say so. But it
really doesn’t mean anything of the sort.
Sound-signals are for the information, not
of one ship alone, but of all ships within
sight or hearing. Art. 28 para. 3 of the
regs. for preventing collisions at sea says
that one short blast means “I am directing
my course to starboard.” Just that and no-
thing- else. In other words, the signal in-
forms every ship within sight that the vessel
making it intends to alter course to star-
board. There is no suggestion in the regula-
tions that such a signal even implies “I am

“Solomon M.”: Consider a cycle of events.
(1) The British coal industry boomed for
a while after the war because French and
Belgian mines were repairing war damage,
and Hun miners were sulking over the
French occupation of their coal country.
At this time the Government paid the first
and biggest (£15,000,000) of a series of sub-
sidies. This increased the boom, and the sub-
sequent tapering off increased the slump.
Wages were high, for England, and the
working week was 42 hours maximum. (2)
Competition resumed violently in every line
of industry, and the slump became acute,
(3) The effort to secure Protection, in order
to prevent the closure of British industries
which used coal, failed, and the slump be-
came more acute. In the first half of this
year ships which relied on coal cargoes for
outward freight began to lie up by hundreds,
and the lying-up had been bad before that!
Those which kept the sea were on a poor
wicket through cheap foreign competition,
save the colored-labor lines, which were
dirt-cheap themselves. (4) Seamen’s wages
were reduced because they seemed the only
body of men who could be reduced. An
attempt was made on the coal-miners, par-
ticularly in the direction of longer hours,
but it ended in them getting a renewed sub-
sidy instead. (5) A British seamen’s strike
in Australian ports, engineered by imported
Communists, re-
sulted in the addi-
tion of some thou-
sands to the unem-
ployed, and in the
increased redun-
dancy and exuber-
ance of Walsh
a n d Johanson.
(6) The financial
straits of Britain
led to a sudden
and pointed dis-
couragement of the
loan industry. So
Australia carried
its lOU to Uncle
Samuel in New
York. Uncle pro-
duced £15,000,000,
which was about a
half-year’s supply
at the current pace,
and so much fuss
was made about it
that Uncle might
have been a hen
which had laid a
beer-barrel instead
of an egg. It is
difficult to sort out
the tangled threads,
but it seems to me
that if John Bull
had provided himself with a robust
Protective tariff about 1921 this
would have been a better world.

“The Missus” (Darwin) : It is
easy for Sir George Buchanan to
throw clods at our “tin humpies”
in the Territory, but he does not
offer any suggestions for improve-
ment. A house of corrugated iron,
correctly built, is quite as satisfac-
tory as one can wish. My own has
three doors to each room, two large
windows, each four feet square ; and the place
is cool, even on the hottest day. A wooden
house is cool, but we have yet to find the
timber that will withstand white ants. Mal-
thoid roofs are good; but here they need tar-
ring each year, or they rot rapidly. Stone
houses look cool; but when they get hot they
keep the heat for days after the thermometer
has dropped. Really, the ideal house for the
Territory is bark; it is always cool, is easy
to build, is practically everlasting, and is
always picturesque. A bark humpy, set in
a sheltered spot and wreathed in creepers
from ground to ridge-capping, is a sight for
an artist. It needs neither paint nor tar.
Nor do the white ants trouble it. I know.
Being a woman I have spent nine-tenths of
my time in the house, and half the day is
passed in the kitchen; so I can appreciate a
building that does not add fried wife to the
menu at every meal. And if I have to do
without many of the labor-saving utilities
that southern women can get so easily, the
fault does not lie with me. It lies with
those politicians who got our Territory on a
promissory-note that now they refuse to
honor. The North-South railway would ease
our burdens a little; it would give us
cheaper goods; it would give us a chance to
have a trip at less than the cost of a man’s
wages for a year or more; it would allow us
a chance to gi e our children a decent edu-
cation ; it would help us to profit by the use
of labor-saving utilities in the house. And
it would prevent globe-trotters, who never
have to wrestle with the troubles of a house-
hold, from throwing clods of scorn at us.
We do our best to hold this land a white
Australian country, and we get neither
thanks nor credit for our work.
«
It is becoming a habit with Australian Labor
leaders to see in every riot, brawl or dog-
fight that occurs in the international arena
the uprising of brother workers against capi-
talist oppression. Their heated approval of
the latest Chinese upheaval is an example.
Yellow helots, led by almond-eyed altruists,
were' said to be fighting to tear better
conditions from European- capitalism. The
demands of the student-leaders don't,
however, indicate much solicitude for
the Chinese toiler. The abolition of
consular courts (the only courts that
administer justice honestly in the country),
the return of the international settlements
(the only areas in China where the Chinese
merchant and the Chinese citizen feel reason-
ably safe) and the right to increase the tariff
on imported goods are given the most promi-
nent places in the demands, whose framers
know quite well that the conditions of
Chinese labor are dictated not by European
capitalists but by the rabbit-like powers of
breeding of the Chinese themselves. The
conditions those powers produce are instauced
by recent inquiries made by the police of the
French concession in Shanghai into the con-
duct of a Chinese-owned establishment with-
in its borders. In this example of capitalist
enterprise (Chinese variety) were found 31
boys between 12 and 15 who had been kid-
napped or purchased from their parents in
the provinces, and were being sold to Chinese
employers for five dollars or less a head.
Although the French police may evict or
hang the yellow slaver in question, they can-
not stop the system of naked slavery that is
rampant throughout the vast crowded terri-
tory beyond their borders. The recent crazy
rioting in the treaty ports and the present
boycott of British goods will have as much
effect in elevating the market price of Celes-
tial blood and bone as Tom Walsh’s
sciuabble with Havelock Wilson will im-
prove the rate of wages of British seamen.

There was a demonstration of the strange
inequalities of the Law when Judge
Woinarski (Vic.) handed an ex-policeman
15 months’ imprisonment for receiving horses
knowing them to have been stolen. S’Onah
intimated that the sentence was made
warmer for this man because he had been
in the police force, and “knew better than
the ordinary layman the consequences of his
acts.” But how does this square with the
extremely light sentences passed upon the
detectives who were not ex-policemen, but
were still under their oath to uphold the
law? The crime of horse-receiving, how-
ever heinous, can hardly be compared with
deliberate blackmail. The detectives were
evidently lucky in not having the gravity
of their delinquencies assessed by Judge
Woinarski.

“The Traveller” : If Vic. Railways Com-
missioner Clapp wrote a memo, about exces-
sive hours (B. 3/9/’25) it is pretty certain
he was thinking more of the “standing time”
that was being paid for than of the men.
Unless a saving can be shown, long hours
are still worked ; and that can’t be done
without peril to the public. I know an
engine crew who had to do 14 hours’ solid
going only a day or two ago. The local boss
explained that it could not be helped except
by the bringing of another crew from the
next depbt, and keeping the men over Sun-
day on the regulation expenses. “The heads
would not stand that,” the boss explained.
The men themselves are not entirely blame-
less, for there are always some ready to
work any old hours for the sake of overtime.
The only way to stop excessive hours is to
make an absolute limit of, say, 12. To lay
it down that long hours must not be worked
“'unless unavoidable” is merely providing
loopholes.
The limitations of science pressing hardly
on Sir Oliver Lodge, he finds occasional
relief in leaving the realm of proof for that
of speculation, where his imagination may
roam fancy free. The cable reports that,
in a “sermon” he delivered in connection
with the meetings of the British Association,
he declared that, though the earth lasted 100
million years, as it well might, the human
spirit would last longer; and he gave it as
his opinion that “we take with us our charac-
ter for better or for worse. With it we
continue to eternity. It is a formidable
thought.” It is indeed. One cheering fea-
ture of the Christian faith is that it offers
some chance of purging out the dross from,
maybe, our own character, and more par-
ticularly from our neighbor’s, and making
a fresh start in the new world. According
to the gospel by Lodge we shall have to
carry the dreary old things along with us
“for better or for worse’”—there is some-
thing grimly satirical in the words —and for
more millions of years than we can con-
ceive. There will henceforth be no need for
asking of Death where is his sting, for Sir
Oliver has found it. All the little defects
so patent in the folk around us, the short-
comings of wives, children, politicians and
those irritating bridge partners who make it
no trumps with a sublime faith in dummy,
can never be wiped out by some kindly
sponge in the Hereafter. All the pleasure
of dying will be lost and only the sting re-
main. No matter how far in advance we
may answer the hail of the grim ferryman,
sooner or later one or two people who at
present shall go unnamed will pop up and
the same old friction be renewed. We are
never to get rid of them—-never!

POLITICAL
POINTS.
N.S.W. Labor M’s.P. really ought to hold
a meeting and agree on the lie they are going
to tell about the 44-hour week. Murray, of
Newcastle, for instance, talked of the 15,000
unemployed that Lang faced when he became
Premier, and the need to make the employ-
ment go further by reducing hours. And
then Burke rose on the same side to
speak with Labor’s other voice and show that
when the 44-hour week was previously intro-
duced in N. S. Wales production per head
increased greatly. What is the Labor theory ?
Reduction of hours can’t increase production
per head and reduce it. Lang can’t have it
both ways.
Of course, the pay of British seamen —
£lO per month for a few months, prior to
August and £9 before and since—is cruelly
low. But the hard fact is that there is
over a million tons of shipping idle in
Britain because it couldn’t pay even the
£lO rate, and the seamen who might be
manning the vessels if they could be run
without loss are among the million and more
unemployed in the Cold Country. It is no
use talking about the Inchcape boats and the
profits they make. No doubt they, do make
profits; but their passenger-carrying trade
is a very small trade, comparatively speak-
ing, and theirs is the luck to have it.
The N.S.W. Government gets plenty of
kicks and no ha’pence by being servile to
the Johansons of this world. In one of his
shifting moods Premier Lang denounced the
Federal Government for its failure to detect
and shut out foreign Communists, even in-
fant ones, on arrival and before they had
shown what they were. It required no
courage to fulminate in this manner against
some hypothetical nuisance who may never
be here. The proposal to shut out some very
much detected nuisances who are here, and
whom it would require some little valor to
denounce, found Lang shouting in the other
camp. As a natural result Johanson poured
bitter contempt on the Lang . Ministry for
its cowardice and “betrayal” in not giving
enthusiastic suppoi’t to the strike of British
seamen against their own unions. In fact,
he could hardly have been more unpleasant
if Lang had been partly a dog and partly
the dregs of society.
As a preliminary effort towards better
things the British Government lately put a
duty on imported motor-cars. One result
was the arrival of a breathless French maker,
Citroen by name, to put up works which
are to employ 5000 British artisans. Repeat
that 30 times and you give direct employ-
ment to 150.000 people and indirect employ-
ment to perhaps three times that number.
After all, that million and a half of unem-
ployed in Britain are not so utterly un-
shiftable as the hopeless Freetrade person
tries to make us think.
The N.S.W. “primary producer” is being
told by the Labor Government that the 44-
hour week won’t affect him —it won’t apply
to rural workers. But it will affect him. If
the same wages have to be paid in other in-
dustries for 44 hours as are now paid for 48,
the prices of the things he has to buy from
the city will be increased by at least one-
twelfth. The manufacturer will pass this
on—in most cases he will have to do it or
shut up shop—but how is the “primary pro-
ducer” going to pass it on? He, in fact, is
the one person in the whole community who
won’t be able to do it. So he more than any-
body else will have to nurse Lang’s baby;
and considering the help he has given in
making a Lang Government possible he de-
serves it.
When the motion protesting against the
proposed change in the method of selecting
State Governors was being debated in the
W.A. Council, one speaker said that, as we
borrowed our cash from England, it was only
right that an English representative should
occupy the vice-regal chair in order to see
how the money was spent. The Bulletin
now has visions of a gentleman from the
U.S.A. opening our future chicken shows.
The wickedest because the most spurious
carrot dangled in front of the unfortunate
British seamen on strike in Australia was
THE CATS PAW.
that, being out, they could compel the owners
to pay them Australian rates when they went
back. Australian rates are, of course, only
possible because the inter-State trade has the
benefits of High Protection —even the British
boat may not put its nose into that business,
let alone the Jap or the Chinese.
N.S.W. Labor Ministers announce that the
44-hour week isn’t to apply to rural workers.
Why not? If, as they or some of them
allege, it will increase production and not
decrease it, why not give the farmer the benefit
of it? The truth, of course, is that Ministers
know the yarn about increasing production
isn’t true; and too many Labor seats are
dependent upon the small cocky to chance
his vote. The other employer doesn’t matter
—they reckon he doesn’t vote for them, any-
how.
“There are, I believe,” said the Mayor of
Sydney to a paralysed group of pressmen
the other day, “millions and millions of
acres unoccupied in Central Australia, and
millions and millions of money must be spent
on them to provide them with water and
transport facilities. There are also millions
of acres locked up, good land that the dogs
in the mangers who guard them have in-
herited and on which they pay little or no
taxes. Burst these lands open,” etc., etc.
On which it may be remarked, using the
fine, large, misty hyperbole favored in Gaud-
mayoral circles, that there are millions and
millions of civic employees in the city work-
ing millions and millions of fewe- hours for
millions and millions more money ud while
the rhetorical Mayor and his party continue
to make loafing round a city so much more
attractive than working on the land, the
multitudinous acres will continue to remain
unoccupied, and there will be fewer and
fewer millions to spend on them.
Some of the mock heroics of Andy Watt,
K.C., before the Deportation Board suggested
that he didn’t think much of the Board. One
effort was to the effect that by passing the
law under which it was proposed to send
the Dutchman Johanson home, Australia
had “thrown off allegiance to the British
Empire.” As the Empire hasn’t cabled about
the matter lingering hopes are entertained
that this isn’t true. The K.C. also declared
that if the same law had prevailed in his
father’s time the old gentleman might have
been sent back whence he came. As to which
it can only be remarked that if Watt, senior,
did anything in his lifetime to bring him
within the reach of the Deportation Law, the
tqpic is better buried. It is a mistake to
wash the family skeleton in public.
To one Vic. townlct Prime Minister Bruce
the other day read the famous deliverance of
imported “Jock” Garden at Moscow, to the
effect that 1000 recognised Communists in
Australia were sufficient to manage 400,000
Australian workmen; and he asked hotly if
it said much, for the Labor movement that
such a man remained at the head of it. No,
it doesn’t. And considering the powers the
Government has, and might have had much
earlier, it doesn’t say much for a number of
other people either.
Up to August 31 the Commonwealth paid
away £5,303,085 in bounties for the encour-
agement of Australian industry. Sugar, beef
and live cattle accounted for £4,276,531, the
sugar industry alone being responsible for
£3,899,542. Other articles which received a
helping hand were fruit, crude shale-oil,
cotton, flax, hemp, cotton, tobacco-leaf,
cotton-seed and linseed. The Bulletin
isn’t complaining: it merely asks the “pri-
mary producer” to note that these things are
an outrage on the Freetrade axiom that if
an industry can’t stand alone it should fall
down and die. Now there is a further de-
mand for a Federal bonus ou gold produc-
tion ; and as that isn’t a permanent but a
perishing industry, the attention of the Cob-
denite members from Westralia is drawn to
it. Which will they throw overboard—
Cobden or the bonus?
It was difficult to find the right thing to
say in the hour of defeat, so the Queens-
land Premier merely remarked that the next
Labor Conference must decide between arbi-
tration and violence, and that he had no
desire to lead a party of direct action. No
Minister remains now of the team which took
office in the first year of Labor control.
Gillies made his entrance in 1919, and an-
swered to the name of Secretary for Agricul-
ture until a few monthe ago', when he whs
suddenly impelled to the front just when the
rear had become the only happy spot. His
predecessors, Ryan and Theodore, conceded
everything they were asked; and there isn’t
much left for Gillies to concede now except
the right to refuse anything.
“7PN”: As tilings are doiite in Queens-
land. West from Win ton an, unused rail-
way sprawls along the landsc ape. Sleepers
and rails were laid to the TKventy-mile in
T- J. Ryan’s day, and then the work was
abandoned. One version is that it halted for
lack of funds; others insist the .work was
stopped to nark the squatting (interests. As
a matter of fiact the work wa/s put in hand
to ensure the return of a Labifrr nominee for
that electorate, and the job cost £250,000.
Tussocks and young scrub Ifeve sprung up
between the sleepers; the embankments have
sunk below the levels of the. bridges. But
the Labor nominee was returnwl alliright, and
still helps to hand over the Gfovernment of
Queensland to non-elected outsiders.
There was “interruption from the Govern-
ment benches” in Queensland! when Opposi-
tion-leader Moore said the steps in revo-
lution had just been taken, in the State.
Qertainly it wasn’t the fii'jht step or the
second ; they were taken ago. But when
a .body of men set itself up /in opposition to
th& Government and won, a longer step was
taken tlian ever this country? had seen before.
The Soviet dream is of a Govern-
ment”; and the body that governs—whether
it is called a strike committee or anything
else —V s ih e Government.
Front the Federal Gallerjy:—
The party in the Reps, is far ahead of its
opponents in tactical ability afid oratory; and the
way in wfifeh some of those opponents walk into the
traps that Labor delights in laying when it is
in a bear-baiting humor is almost pathetic. Taking
an opportunity which it would not have been safe
to turn into* a direct attack, Mahony was put up
one day last week to ask the Speaker whether his
attention had bqen drawn to “an article in a certain
newspaper” in' which the name of a member of the
honorable House was connected with an alleged
attempt to use money to damage the industries of
Australia. Actually, Mahony made no charges, but
portentously he read the article through, lingering
on the sensational headlines which contained the
worst sting. Promptly Mann, M.H.R. for Perth,
rushed into the bull-ring and soon talked himself
into difficulties, to the delight of the Laborites and
the pain of his friends. Getting excited, he asserted
his knowledge of a case in which a manufacturer had
offered £lOOO to party funds for certain tariff
advantages—a statement that made him look small
when Dr. Maloney said tersely that, if he knew
any such incident, it was his duty to expose it and
the people concerned. Next Brennan, the party’s
toreador, leapt in to finish off the Freetrade blunderer.
There is not a man in the House who can handle
satire better than Brennan, and Mann and the
Government were well flayed before the end. It was
a typical waste of a few hours; but for once in
a way the Labor benches were full, and the Laborites
enjoyed themselves immensely.
A matter which still cries aloud for ex-
planation is why almost every N. S. Wales
Labor official within reach, and many un-
officials, and many who seem out of reach,
are so anxious to toil in the Leg. Council
for no remuneration save a pass which
doesn’t even entitle the traveller to a free
sandwich. The present rush of applicants
is said to “exceed all anticipations,” and yet
people anticipated something like Xerxes’
army applying for Greece. Ex-Premier
Fuller will be remembered for three things.
Though the need for action was plain enough
for a blind man to see without lighting a
match, he didn’t abolish the nominee system
for Assembly vacancies, he didn’t attempt to
put the Upper House on an elective footing
and makp it proof against the ugly rush, and
he didn’t even fill existing vacancies with
nominees of his own, and give his party a
chance. Even Lang, though he worked 44
hours a day, couldn’t do much worse than
that for his State and for Australia.
The Vic. Parliament is wrestling with an
Apprenticeship Bill in the effort to provide
the city boy who has left school with some
alternative besides delivering milk and pre-
mature burglary. A fragment from the re-
port :—•
Mr. Lemmon (Labor M.L.A.) referred to - the
slipshod manner in which apprentices were now
being trained, and quoted some instances which had
come under his notice in the boot trade, lie knew
of a boy who was bound for six years as a Heeler
and slugger. An average boy could learn the opera-
tion in three months. Another boy had been bound
4J years in the work of sandpapering heels. At
the conclusion of such an apprenticeship the boy
would be thrown on the scrap-heap. It was a tragedy.
And a happening like that hasn’t even the
merit of being a picturesque tragedy, but is
squalid and untidy to the limit. Apprentice-
ship reform has been under consideration for
25 years or so, but the difficulty has been
want of time. A Legislature which sits half
the year and less than half the week during
that half is always short of time.
“Jog”: Thd other week our firm brought
to Bundaberg (Q.) 20 tons of newsprint pur-
chased in Sydney. The coastal freight
amounted to £B6. A similar quantity arrived a
couple of weeks later from Lopdon. The freight
was £7B. The last lap of the journey—Bris-
bane to Bundaberg—was made by both con-
signments in the same vessel, but on different
trips. It takes a robust tariff to protect the
Australian manufacturer when the coastal
freights give the fellow at the end of the
earth such a fine start as this. -
THE PARABLE OF JOTHAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Trees of Old they clamored for a King to lash
their mulishness;
They wearied of the Democratic touch;
They craved a Lord to chasten them for all their
petty foolishness
And looked to find a remedy for such.
They went unto the Olive. “Wilt thou govern us,
O Friend ?”
The Olive: “Not a moment would I deign;
My mission is anointing men before the Lord who
bend.
How could I leave the work to rule and reign?”
So then they sought the lowly Fig. “Wilt thou be
crowned King ?”
The Fig replied: “Shall I give up my sweetness
To please a foolish fancy of the Multitude who’d
fling
A stain upon my record of Completeness?”
Then spoke they to the Vine: “O Vine, come down
and take the throne.”
“But, Friends, I glad the hearts of Cod and Man;
My juice it hath an empire and a sceptre of its own
Beyond the bounds of Beersheba and Dan 1”
Then ran they to the Bramble. “Of a certainty,”
said he.
“I feel that I am suited to the crown.
So wrap my regal robes about and let me go and see
Who’ll dare to pull the Royal Bramble down.
‘Within my shadow’ ye shall rest. But lo! how loftily
Those Cedars wave on Lebanon so tall!
Their stately stand-off manners are a worrv'unto Me—•
So let a fire run ravage through them all.”
Sot alone on Gerizim, the gentle slope of Gerizim,
Do multitudes enthrone a weedy thing;
And daily up in Lebanon, and other heights than
Lebanon.
Do Cedars burn to please a Bramble King.

A luscious profit. And yet everything wasn’t
clear sailing. South was affected by the
Central fire: its 1270 ft. and 1370 ft. levels
were flooded by water poured into the
affected area. Also much Jess profit was got
from old dumps. But increased tonnage
and value of crudes and extraordinarily high
prices more than counter-balanced all that.
Lead averaged £35 4s. over the period com-
pared with £29 10s. 4d. for the preceding
12 months. Silver was 2d. better (2s. ll.Od.)
and zinc 325. lid. better (£34 9s. Id.).
Profits were further assisted by increased re-
ceipts from zinc consequent upon the granu-
lar zinc tailings being treated in the co.’s
own plant. The accounts modestly claim, a
net profit of £473,357; but additions to vari-
ous visible reserves bring it up to the figure
set out in the table. Here are the reserve
movements :

ment reserve .. 101,671 101,671 101,671
£938,711 £1,156,344 £1,277,934
All those accumulations may not be true
profit. It depends upon whether the pro-
visions for every contingency have been
adequate. In that connection the matter, of
mine wastage, usually one of supreme
importance, need hardly be considered, de-
spite the 257,879 tons of ore extracted, for
the estimated reserves at June 30 (4,000,000
tons) were 350,000 tons greater than the
estimate of a year earlier. And there is
more than the figure quoted, according to
Government Geologist E. C. Andrews.
The old slime dumps, the accumulation of
25 years, were practically worked out by
April, 1924, and profit on working account
from that source slumped by £193,328. This
had been a wonderful source of profit for
many years, as the following comparison
indicates:—

£1,082,271 £1,141,496 £530,232 £520,267
It is not long since more than half of the
working profit came from the treatment of
old slime. In 1923 the metals from these
dumps accounted for an estimated gross pro-
fit of £204,305. Still even now the manage-
ment may get a bit from old dumps. Tlic co.’s
metallurgists are wrestling with the pro-
position of profitably treating 119,000 tons
of oxidised crusts containing 11.7 p.c. lead,
61oz. silver and 16.7 p.c. zinc. Of the de-
leaded slime residues, 133,090 tons contain-
ing 13.2 p.c. zinc, 1.90 z. silver pd 3.7 p.c.
lead were treated during the year; 276,321
tons remained on June 30.
As the end of the slime dumps came in sight
general-manager Wainwright gave himself
up to the problem of increasing the produc-
tion of crudes. There had been a severe set-
back in output as a result of the cut in
working hours underground (27| hours) under
the Edmunds award. But the metal prices
made almost anything possible, and despite
the Central fire production jumped forward.
In 1919, 164,560 tons were raised; 1922,
104,955 tons; 1924, 239,508 tons; last year,
257,879 tons. Here is a comparison of pro-
duction and costs for three years:—

The 1924 output was affected by the water
from the Central, but the last of that trouble
is in sight. The 1270 ft. level was de-watered
and cleaned up, and, more labor being avail-
able, a fair proportion of ore has lately been
broken there. Increased tonnages of crude
were hauled, the weekly average being 4959
compared with 4606 for the previous year.
For June an average of 6110 tons was
treated per week. The metal bonus is giving
these mines the pick of the labor of Australia.

Cash .. .. 170,606 369,590 465,286
Increased royalty operated from January,
1925, and added £7500 to liabilities. Of the
investments £200,000 consists of shares in
Associated Smelters, £150,000 in Electro-
lytic Zinc, £46,000 shares and debentures in
British Australian Lead Manufacturers. All
are good div. payers, but all are bound up
in the industry, and are, to that extent, not
to be regarded as liquid in case of great-
trouble in the metal business. The cash
holding was almost £lOO,OOO greater than at
the previous June. No. J 5 div., absorbing
£lOO,OOO, was paid on August 15. Counting
the share holdings with the liquids the fol-
lowing comparison is reached:—
1923. 1924. 1925.
Assets other than
mine and plant.. £1,091,197 £1,287,112 £1,410,833
Liabilities .. 200,405 222,014 234,547
Excess assets .. £890,792 £i;065,098 £1,176,286
That liquid surplus means 295. 5d., for each
of the 800,000 £1 shares. And there was,
in addition, the mine and plant. Given
reasonable market conditions ore reserves
assure the co. a long life—and that more
lies beyond the mapped area will almost cer-
tainly be proved. The financial position is
very strong, and world prices seem likely to
remain for some time at very profitable
levels.

On February 28 visible,, reserves were
£4,242,902, almost three-quarters of a mil-
lion more than paid capital. The Board has
long followed the policy of issuing new capi-
tal at a heavy premium, and £1,900,000 has
been added to reserves from that source
since 1913. That takes the gilt off the 15
p.c. divs. for the greater part of the capital.
Nevertheless the market holds the scrip in
high esteem, and recent sales have been
made at £l5 and £l4 10s. Shares are £l5
each paid to £5, the £lO being not callable
except in the event of a winding-up. Gross
profits, after making provision for bad and
doubtful debts and other contingencies, were
about the average of recent years:—

1920 .. 1,104,474 ]. 1925 .. 1,430,714
A big gain was made in the net position,
however, by a shrinkage! of £36,887 in taxes.
This table shows the grouped expenses
items:—

Of recent years the margins between visible
profits and dividends have been narrow, but
with hundreds of thousands added to reserves
from share premiums there has been no
necessity to add substantially to visible re-
serves out of profits—it has seemed sounder
policy to put surpluses away in the private
stocking to meet contingencies.

Of liabilities, bills payable (in which item
is included part of the contingencies re-
serves) were £110,498 less, while deposits
showed a favorable movement to the extent
of £1,157,466. The liquid position was
strong, 10s. 4d. of every £ of outside liability
being readily available. There was strength,
too, in the relation of the bank’s own funds
to the. public’s money, the latest additions
to capital and reserves reducing the propor-
tion to £5 of outside money for each £1 of
funds. This means that the bank has laid
the foundations for a larger business than
it is now doing. And apart from the visible
strength are the internal resources which
must be very substantial. Premises, for
example, are in at £391,553, a ridiculous
sum compared with the real value of that
asset. Altogether there is plenty of secu-
rity .to impress customers, a fine profit-
earning capacity to comfort shareholders and
mounting reserves to intrigue the market.

And that table puts the best face on things,
because previously there hadn’t been a divi-
dend for seven years—never had been a divi-
dend, in fact. In that period, however, the
long-headed managing-director had not only
worked down the deficit of nearly £lO,OOO
with which she started, but built up a new
business on top of the old one wdiich the
war had badly damaged. On the figures of
1920-21-22, probably we expected too much:
what isn’t easy to realise is that a hotel as
much talked about as the Wentworth has,
after all, had a capital of only £35,000. It
takes genius to get that sort of proposi-
tion ticketed in the public mind with the
quarter-million and half-million propositions.
At present, Avith the additions lately made,
freeholds and leaseholds stand in the books
at £74,731 and £10,626 has been put into
the Garden Cafe. Even the lately-enlarged
capital (it is now £50,000) isn’t equal to
carrying all that load; and £36,011 is owing
on various accounts. In the past year, it
is said, building operations interfered with
profits. They probably did. On the other
hand, the country’s conditions have been—
on the surface, at any rate—so extraordi-
narily prosperous that hotels such as this
ought to have been enjoying just as fruity
a time as they can ever reasonably expect to
have. Still, this has to be remembered:
while the co. pays dividend on the enlarged
capital for the full year, it is only just now
that the additions have been earning any-
thing; and that may make the current and
future years’ earnings better. If they are
not, the 10 p.c. will not be any too safe.

Notwithstanding dazzling prices for wool
to the growers, and dazzling commissions
to Elder Smith’s, and rich wheat returns
and general prosperity, the profit disclosed
was slightly less than for 1924. There is
in this more than a suggestion that the
management called up the office pessimist
and gave, him a free hand. The office pessi-
mist is an old-established institution in this
office; and of recent years there have been
two illustrations of his insistence on Safety
First. In 1923 £109,650 was transferred
“from amounts standing to the credit of
internal prolusion at .Tune 30, 1914,” and
capitalised; and five years earlier £90,000
was brought to light. Still, it has to be kept
in mind that almost everything has been
going the co.’s way of late, and it is too
much to expect that it will always be so.
And in that connection the very great
changes that have taken place in the capital
acount have to be noted. At June 30.
244,000 £lO shares were issued, all paid
to £6. Since the close of the accounts the
balance (56,000) have been issued at par to
shareholders in. the proportion of one to five;
and as in the case of the earlier issue they
will be called to £6. This will lift paid
capital to £1,800,000. How the total has
raced along this table shows: —

So for the future it will take £lBO,OOO to pay
a 10 p.c. div. ; and that looks a big figure
alongside the visible profits for any year
prior to 1923. Of course, the new capital
will be earning money, and the past few
years have piled up the reserves, which also
earn money; all the same, given the un-
favorable conditions that must be expected
to swing around again sometime or other,
the directors are not going to have the easy
task to pay 10 p.c. that their predecessors
had when the capital was £300,000 or
£400,000.

The co. had to finance clients to the extent
of almost an additional half-million, hut it
did not have to look outside for the money,
ludeed, total liabilities were £115,387 less
than in the previous year. The co. still
lumps “all other liabilities” with fixed and
other deposits, and on the assets side
“advances, stocks and shares in other cos.”
are grouped. Perhaps it doesn't matter
much in this case, but generally speaking the
proportion of deposits withdrawable at short
notice should be stated.
Substantial provision has presumably been
made for contingencies: future disclosed pro-
fits ,may depend very largely upon that.
Wool seems likely to remain steady, even
if 'tlie October-December prices have gone
for good; but many pastoral and farm pro-
perties have changed hands at values based
on extravagant wool and wheat prices, and
there will be little in it for those owners
if prices drop or drought dries up the land.
Meantime, the co.’s finances are more than
comfortable. Of total liabilities of
£2,107,105, £1,074.913 was covered by cash
and public securities. Other more or less
liquid assets (including advances) amounted
to £3,191,682. After payment of the final
div. there were net tangible assets with a
book value of £2,329,688, equal to £9 11s.

When considering last year’s profit it must
be remembered that only 75 p.c. of the wool
clip was sold. ‘ As Moreheads is one of the
biggest of the Queensland wool-trading con-
cerns it did not escape the common experi-
ence, and the’ figure must, therefore, be
accounted satisfactory. Gross profit was
£6073 more than in the previous year, but
most of the increase was eaten up by
exes. Since accounts were closed wool
sales have been reopened and the firm-
ness of prices at the lower level augurs
well for the new term. Sheep values
moved up when wool prices hit the
roof, 355. being paid for good wool-growing
wethers, off-shears delivery. Quotations fell
back to 20s. when wool prices broke. Im-
provement in cattle values of from 10 p.c.
to 12 p.c., with a steady demand, also
assisted. The most encouraging of chair-
man Norman Bourke’s remarks to share-
holders was the statement that present beef

This asbestos covering prevents loss of heat by radi-
ation in boilers and condensation of steam pipes.
Adams’s Asbestos Covering saves from 30 per cent, to
45 per cent, in fuel, less stoking is required where it
is used, and steam pressure keeps uniform. Inquire

The light weight of Pioneer Wood Pipe is a big
factor in its popularity. For instance, a 12ft. length
of 12in. Pioneer Wood Pipe weighs only 2301 b.
against some 8701 b. for the same size (and more
costly) metal pipe. Thus, as may well be seen,
enormous savings can be made on transportation and
installation alone when this modern wood conduit is
specified, and its service records everywhere tell of
its efficiency. The Australian Wood Pipe Co., Ltd.,

With cash, public securities and book debts
amounting to £62,958, and liabilities _ stand-
iug at £17.235, the fiualicial position on
April 30 was very strong. In addition
there is £35,736 in shares in other cos., and
the value of that holding is disclosed by divs.
received during the year—£s363; equal to
15 p.c. p.a. Unlike most wool houses, More-
heads does not lean on outsiders. to any ex-
tent, last year's outside debt being a shade
lighter despite a rise of £12,79-1 in sundry
debtors. Although the eo. has a good record
as a div. payer, its expansion has been slow:
paid capital in 1907 was £56,550; on April
30 last it was £90,000. Reserves are £10,20-
in excess of the goodwill item of £50,000,
and net tangibles amount to 235. 4d. for
each £1 share. Judged on the present posi-
tion of wool and the improvement in cattle
prices, the immediate outlook is bright.

Westralia’s widest and longest gold-bearing
lode, the Big Bell, near Cue, is to be tried
again by D. L. Doolctte and his friends.
Open cutting it 100 ft. wide with a scrap-
iron plant, Chesson and Heyden failed to
make 16s. recovery pay. The W.A. Bank
-and State Mines Department followed with
G. S. Skuthorp in charge and broke even
on the treatment of 20,000 tons. Recently
Riddle and Heasier discovered that 40s.
ore lies to the eastward of the mica-scliist
to which operations have hitherto been con-
fined, and the ore channel is to be tested by
crosscutting from the Big Bell main work-
ings.

Sydney speculators have abandoned their
option bn Wodgina tinfield (W.A.), and
their representative, Jock Thomson, has
moved further inland to Braeside lead de-
posits, beyond Marble Bar; State mining-
engineer Blatchford reported about a year
ago that the Braeside lodes showed great
persistence in length, some of the outcrops
being continuous for several miles and con-
taining in places up to 85 p.c. lead. He
added that associated with the lead were
high-grade copper deposits. Thomson has
induced the State to pay half the cost of
some preliminary development, and he
reckons if this work proves satisfactory
Sydney will find all the capital required
to do the rest. Westralia could do with
a real live lead industry. Many attempts
have been made to turn the Northampton
deposits to profitable account, and although
some have been successful many have
failed. Recently several mines there were
re-opened and resumed production. New
finds helped, but the aggregate output lias
been small, and, as the rich shoot in the
principal show —the Surprise—has cut out,
it is likely to become smaller still.
* * * *
From a man on the spot:—
H. E. Vail, who is bossing operations for the
option-holding syndicate, reckons that the lode cut.
in the Wiluna mines (W.A.) is worth about 395.
6d. per ton for a width of 42ft.. He also says that
the ore is amenable to treatment by roasting, fine
grinding and cyaniding, at a cost not exceeding that
incurred in the treatment of Lake View and Star
rock at Kalgoorlie. Extraction value of Lake View
and Star ore is about 325., and no profit is made.
Possibly, mining costs will be lower at Wiluna than
at the Star. Extraction value of Wiluna ore is
about 355. 6d., so if results achieved at Lake View
and Star on 325. extraction be a guide, there is a very
small margin at Wiluna to be relied on for profit
and repayment of capital.

Two of Adelaide’s unlucky ones, Golden
Butterfly and Mighty Atom, held meetings
the other day and announced to anxious
shareholders that they were on the lookout
for promising shows. Both have had more
than their share of duds, and on the law of
averages should do better in future. Mean-
while, funds in both cases are low, and
should new options be acquired calls are
inevitable.

When the Macdonneli Ranges are brought
within reasonable reach of the prospector,
its mountains and valleys may be explored,
liven now some things are being found. The
Northern Australian Exploration Co. holds a
mica show that is turning out good-quality
and large-size sheets up to 14in. x Bin. Seven
ewt. has been shipped to New York, and half
a ton more is ready to go. The cost of pro-
duction and transport is given as £250 a
ton, and the sales price should reach over
£2OOO. The mica is being got in two open
cuts. Two shafts, 30ft. deep, with drives
at bottom, are reported as showing the stuff
all the way. It is claimed that 25
per cent, of the product is clear mica, the
rest bearing the usual stains of iron, etc.,
that diminish but do not by any means de-
stroy the value.

where it is intended to Buy .some

the W.A. coast to Wyndham, whence motor
transport will cover the 400 miles to Tanamij
It is the motor-lorry that has put Tananii

anyhow. The field lies just about as far
over the W.A. border, in the Territory, as
Broken Hill lies in N.S'.W. beyond the Stoth

the men on Kimberley in the ’eighties; Since
then he has been Chief Inspector of Abos.
in the N.T. He thinks a lot of Jensen,
former Director of Mines, etc., there; and
Jensen thinks a lot of Tanami. Stewart
is a well-known mining-engineer with experi-
ence in Australia and Asia. They have
taken on a man’s job, and everybody who
knows what isolation means will wish them
the fortune of which they are so confident.
To enable the Morning Star, Wood’s Point,
to make a fresh start, Vie. Government has
authorised an advance of £3OOO on condition
that the co. spends as much of its own. The
Ministry has not forgotten the repayment of
the £12,000 previously lent to it by the Trea-
sury : still fresh in the memories of depart-
mental officers is the ceremony of January,
1922, when the directors waited on Sam
Barnes, then Minister for Mines, and handed
him a cheque for £lO,OOO, the second instal-
ment of the repayment.

South Lucknow (N.S.W.) struck a fault
in the rise at the 200 ft. level, and the ore
body was thrown Bft. on the footwall side.
A rise of 18ft. in the channel here inter-
cepted the lode again, but values were poor.
At the 280 ft. level the lode exposed is 30ft.
long, and averages 3ft. wide, rich pyrites
veins being interspersed.

Queensland gold yield continues to fade.
For the first seven months of the year pro-
duction was 31,1820 z. fine, valued at
£133,243, compared With 51,8130 z. fine,
valued at £220,057, for the corresponding
period of last year.
Shareholders of Great Northern Tin, Her-
berton (N.Q.), should have a happy spin
for the next year or two. They have just
crushed 64 tons ore averaging about 20 p.c.
for concentrates. Most of this came from
the winze which is being sunk on the new
shoot between Nos. 3 and 4 levels to make a
connection via No. 4 with the main shaft.
When this is done overhead stoping will
root out the rich stuff cheaply, and divs.
should be regular. So far in the winze grab
samples run 15 to 30 p.c. The size of the
ore body is not yet defined, but enough is
showing to make it stand out as the best-
looking tin-mine at the moment in the State.

Just as Mt. Mulligan (Q.) State colliery
started to pay its way a strike was declared
because of the sacking of an employee. For-
tunately Chillagoe works are closed, and the
railways can get Bowen coal at little more
than the local fuel costs. So nobody is really
suffering but the strikers.

Indooroopilly silver-lead mine, in the
suburbs of Brisbane, has not been flattering
to its supporters recently. Ore values have
fallen below 3 p.c., and the long-promised
dividend has not been forthcoming. Owing
to the uncertainty regarding immediate pros-
pects. L. C. Ball was called in. • The market
awaits his* report.
Events certainly conspire to close Mt.
Morgan. The drawing of the fires by direct
action means stoppage of pumping, and it is
a mine that has always demanded unceasing
vigilance on account of creeps. A week or
two without the pumps will cause almost in-
calculable damage. It is a matter of more con-
cern to the Government than the share-
holders, who are resigned to almost any-
thing. The miners evidently hope to get the
losing concern added to the list of State
mining enterprises ; and that may explain why
some of them at any rate were so enthusias-
tic in attacking the fire that broke out un-
derground a few days ago. The co.’s colliery
at Baralaba is also closed down, throwing
an extra 150 men out of employment.

Mining men on Charters Towers still have
hopes of the big lode at Mt. Clearview, Cape
River Diggings (N.Q.). It was last turned
down by C. H. Wray, who examined for
Mines Investigation, Ltd. Wray was not
satisfied with either tonnages or values, and
admittedly it is only about a 15dwt. proposi-
tion ; but sinking and crosscutting revealed
three reefs down to about 150 ft., of which
the main reef averaged 7ft. thick. Wray
considered the big body of quartz cut out,
hut a move is now on foot to unwater the
workings and give it another trial by cross-
cut from the footwall reef. If the main
reef lives to 300 ft. its size will make it a
big producer of medium-grade ore provided
it holds its values below 150 ft While its
future isn’t too rosy there is an outside
chance that it may prove the next biggest
thing to Mt. Coolon.

Takuapa (Siam) shares have had a good
rise beyond 30s. on heavy buying from "the
East.” The co. appears to have surmounted
the many setbacks occasioned through plant
miscalculations in the first instance, and its
45 tons in July and 42 in August are indi-
cations of the favorable outlook when the
dredge is keyed up to its 150,000yds. capa-
city. The pound ground being operated gives
an excess of 2oz. over the boring chart —
a good feature; the boot is generally on the
other foot. The nice premium at which
shares stand improves the look of the 35,000
held in reserve for construction of a second
dredge.

From J. li. Strevens: —
Since the Dutch Colonial Government allowed the
nationals of other countries to operate oil concessions
in the Netherlands Indies by the granting of the
Biting (Java) area to the Standard of New York,
Australians are joiziing in the hunt. One of the
latest ventures is A. Pearson’s Netherlands Eastern
Syndicate, which is being floated in Melbourne. It
is in 500 £25 shares of which 200 are now being
issued, 100 to vendors and 200 in reserve. An
option has been secured over an amalgamated con-
cession of some 10,000 acres on the Kali Brantis
River, s.-w. of Sourabaya, The option price is
£3OOO, and the vendors have two bores down to
500 feet, at which depth the first oil-sgnd was
struck in conjunction with highly mineralised iodine
waters. Maps of the area issued by the Dutch Mines
Department show a very extensive axis of anticline
across the property, and the Government Geologist
has recommended deepening the wells below 1100 ft.
where the main Sourabaya “flow” oil-sand should
be struck. Before the option money is paid the
property will be inspected and reported on by myself
in conjunction with the Dutch departmental ofticers
and the representative of a powerful British oil
group to whom the syndicate has offered the property .
Besides the oil ■ concession, the syndicate has secured
prospecting licenses over 10,000 acres of tin-bearing
country in an archipelago off Sumatra, and a lease
of 40 acres of tin-dredging ground in Beechworth
(Vic.). This latter property has been check bored
by E. Francis, who reports satisfactory prospects.
* * * * .
Tin Bentong dredge, after roaming round
the countryside, began work in the new
leases about the beginning of last October.
To get there it ate through two roads and
swam over two river-beds, gathering up
patches of tin from previously-worked or
half-treated ground. With this easy stuff
to work 932,000 c. yds. of drift went down
the boxes. The new area was responsible
for a big share of the wash, as from October
3 to April 30 the dredge sprinted through
no less than 17 acres. Hence the return of
203 J tons oxide is not at all bad considering
the leanness of the first six months’ ground.
The final patch in the old lease of 789,200
vards gave 194 f tons oxide. The co.’s worst
streak of luck has been a landslip on the new
claim which smashed a section of the pipe-
line and hung up work for a month. With
easy ground to handle costs kept down to
5.944 d. ac. yd. The drift was worth 9.18 d.,
a yd., but the little brown brother had to be fed
with royalties, so the net value of the ground
was 7.849 d. Therefore, the margin above
costs gave a profit of £7518, which made it
easy to pay a shilling div. in March. Ambrose
Pratt runs the show, and he vouches that
“as the value of the ground is quite satis-
factory, an era of continuous and profitable
working may be confidently anticipated.”
* * * *
Bucket dredging is to be the rule again
in the Tongkah Compound stable. What be-
comes of the suction dredge the Wild Cat
knoweth not. What it does know is that a
new issue is on the stocks. The plan is to
buy a new steel bucket dredge to handle at
least 320,000 c. yds. a month. To partly
pay for it 49,000 of the shares in reserve
are to be offered pro rata to present share-
holders at 9s. Bd. a share. That will bring
the new scrip to the sum paid on the pre-
sent issue of 151.000 shares. There will
still remain 50,000 shares in reserve to be
used should emergency call for them. With
£20.000 cash in hand and a steady inflow
of divs. from the co.’s interest in the Com-
pound No. 2, there is every chance that the
new dredge will start in 14 months on the
Mantin Setnl area of 400 acres without a
further capital issue. It is to open out
about three miles from where the suction
dredge has been doing its best. Die new
issue is underwritten.

“Methane”: An item in the Y alio urn
(Vic.) scheme that calls for an explanation
is why the proximate analyses of the coal
were originally recalculated on a basis of
40 p.c. moisture. Seeing what a discrepancy
there is between this assumed figure and that
actually found (between 60 and 70 p.c.), the
man in the street is justified in asking wliat
grounds there were for assuming the 40 p.c.
basis. Obviously if the percentage of water
goes up, the percentages of other constitu-
ents, including the votatile hydrocarbons,
come down, and the calorific value suffers
accordingly. One wonders how much of the
scheme has been based on ascertained
fact, and, incidentally, how much of
the eight millions of the taxpayers’
money has been expended uselessly.
When the scheme was in its infancy,
the opinion was expressed by The Bulletiis
that it was largely a matter for an engi-
neering chemist. What was true then is
doubly true now; and it seems imperatively
necessary that such an expert should be
brought in to advise.

• “Conger” : From time immemorial man lias
been loath to part with his most cherished
possession. The Egyptians took _ then
scarabs with them, the Viking his drinking-
cup; and many a savage man took his wives,
in the form of cinders, it is true. At the pre-
sent-day the practice is more common than
might be supposed. An Adelaide publican
asked that a' favorite cockatoo should be
buried with him; and I’ve known several
cases where the hooves of favorite horses
have been buried with their masters. A
pearler, after years of heart-breaking search,
found the three pearls that meant a fortune
to him —and then was carried off the cutter
a dying man. He swallowed the pearls and
begged to be buried at sea. A bushman m
Cape York Peninsula built a funeral pyre,
shot liis favorite dog and placed it on top,
set fire to the pyre, climbed up and blew
his own lights out. He scratched a note
on the bottom of his pannikin explaining
things. I know an opal-miner who asked
that" liis faVorite gbuging-pick might be
buried with him ; and a sea-captain triend
went west with his favorite telescope, i er-
haps he thought it would be of value in locat-
ing reefs and shoals. Fairly numerous busli-
men have been buried with their stockwhips.
But the silent emblem that touched me most
was a pair of brightly-worn stirrup-irons
lashed around a rude eoffin in the heart oi:
the sympathetic bush.

“Oxmead”: The case referred to by
“Herodot” (B. 10/9/ f 25) of a criminal con-
demned to death being permitted to get mat -
ried before being hanged occurred at I re-
man tie (AY.A.) iu 1903. I remember it and
all the circumstances connected therewith
so vividly that I can assure him he is incor-
rect in his assumption that the ceremony was
sanctioned by officialdom to legitiinatise an
unborn child. That question was never raised ;
the contracting parties were both I reneh.
and, although the murder for which tne
bridegroom w T as to pay the penalty had been
a particularly wanton, and atrocious one it
was as a sort of concession to French senti-
ment—regarded as more tender and assertive
in these matters than English—that the
union in the shadow of the gallows was
permitted. Of course there was precedent
for it. The standard case, if one may use
the phrase is that of Colt, the American
murderer, the full story of which may be
found in the “Bon Gaultier Ballads. Colt,
an abnormally gruesome assassin, was
allowed to marry his mistress on the very
morning fixed for his execution, and halt an
hour or so was assigned to the engaging pair
for a honeymoon. But the thing didn t work
out right; the couple didn’t play the game.
The lady smuggled a razor into the con-
demned cell, and, after her departure, when
the sheriff arrived to claim his prey, Colt
was found with his throat cut; “hisnvory
neck was severed and gashed into the bone,
as the poet put it.
“Pink Tape” : A queer run of misunder
standings finished up in the Melbourne
Divorce Court the other day. A young man
brought a girl to a priest and. having given
cogent reasons for an immediate marriage,
was passed on by that priest to another
who duly performed the ceremony. The man
denied in court that he represented that he
and the girl bad already been married before
the Registrar, but the first priest under-
stood they had been, and left it to the
second priest to verify the J)Aormation.
Priest No. 2, however, took for granted tha
everything was all right and issued a certi-
ficate • because the man said lie wanted
W tha? he and the girl had been wedded
according to the rites of: the church; but
as his Riverine; understood there had been
a previous civil marriage lie didn t notit
the Registrar. This irregularity, combined
with the failure of the priest to obtain a
declaration of age from the parties, has now,
years later, resulted m the marriage bem»
declared null. It is the sort of muddle which
might be avoided if a civil ‘ marriage was
made compulsory, leaving the; parties con-
cerned to do what they liked about the
religious function.
“Kerys” • A Maoriland citizen who might
almost be regarded as a professional jury-
man is complaining that since he was nrs
drawn 20 years ago he has never missed a
sitting of the Supreme Court Ihe only offi-
cial explanation tendered is that the ballot-
box has an uncanny way of delivering up the
same names time after time. It is not as
grotesque as it seems, either. Recently m
a suburban parish the church members lent
the vestry the amount necessary for exten-
sive church repairs, the money to be paid
back in lots as drawn for. One large family
who subscribed freely were so fortunate
in receiving their money back that othei
parishioners threw doubt on tlie fair-
ness of the draw, with the result that I, as
a complete stranger to the parish, was asked
to draw the next sweep. The names mean;
nothing to me, but I thought it was strange
that the first four to come out were the same
-—amidst a stunned silence of watching
vestrymen I had drawn the names of all the
remaining members of the already too for-
tunate family!

“X.R.N.”: In wartime sudden emergen-
cies often necessitate feats of pilotage and
navigation on the part of H.M. ships which
put all peace-time efforts in the shade.
About 1 o'clock of a November morning in
1917 H.M.S. Thruster (aptly named), fol-
lowed by 11 other destroyers of the famous
Harwich Force. Slipped from her buoy in the
Stour River. Less than ten minutes before
the officers and men, except .for a few
ratings, had all been peacefully asleep ; but
an urgent SOS from Dover, where a German
raid was in progress, had galvanised the
destroyers into activity. A fog that could
be cut with a knife hung over the sea like a
pall, and it was impossible to see 20 yards
in the woolly darkness. However, time was
the essence of the contract, and in close
order, single line ahead, the 12 boats rushed
down to Dover, covering the 100-odd miles
at an average speed of 33 knots. Down

“Canor”: The Jewish sailor is a rare bird,
but not more rare than the Jew who en-
gages in hard manual toil on firm ground
for weekly wages. I have known only one
Yid who fondled a pick for the basic wage.
He took a tramway-construction job, only
to be promptly rescued
by a co-religionist and
given something more
suitable in the latter’s
old-clo’ shop. The rescuer
later explained to me in
an almost apologetic
manner that the pick-
wielder was a new arrival
and did not know, the
ropes. This odd delicacy
does not extend to labori-
ous occupations in which

“Half-Moon” : A monu-
ment to commemorate the
landing of Captain Cook
o n Possession . Island
(Torres Strait) is being
built there. Previously a
cairn on a bold promon-
tory on the north-eastern
corner of the island
served the purpose, and
the site was an ideal one,
within view of all vessels
using the Inner .Route.
Those associated in the
erection of the new monu-
ment—the Geographical
and Historical Societies
and the Queensland., Gov-
ernment—are allowing it
to be placed on a o other
site quite unsuitable as
regards either visibility
or prominence. The reason
given is that it is too
much trouble to carry the
material any further. So
thoroughly in keeping
with the spirit of the great navigator!
* * * *
“O. Twist”: Judge Bevan, at Goulburn
(N.S.W.) Quarter Sessions, initiated a prac-
tice capable of wide extension. As far back
as 1924 he had bound over a youth of 19
to come up for sentence when called upon.
The-youngster could not find the sureties, so
he spent the time in gaol, where he seemed
to be contented, and proved himself a good
worker. Of course, sentence had to be-
passed some time, and the youngster - “came
up.” The Judge was troubled. Being
afflicted with a conscience, he desired to do
the best for the boy. He accordingly ex-
plained to him that the sentence of two years
he was about to pass wasn’t intended as a
punishment. “I am convinced.” said he,
“that if you were released from gaol without
having a trade at your disposal, it would
be no time before you were in trouble again.
My only object in sending you to gaol is that
you may learn a trade.” Doubtless, a wise
and upright Judge, but what is going to
happen if the principle is extended? Shall
we have future deliverances of this kind:
“Percy Candlctree, you have been charged
with being the most diligent youth of your
school, and a shining light in the Boy Scouts.
We feel that you are far too promising a
citizen to be thrown out into the world; so
in order that you may be trained for the
battle of life I sentence you to three years’
imprisonment”? All, no doubt, highly credit-
able to our gaol system ; but what sort of a
reflection does it cast on our industrial
system ?
“Sixenate” : A quaint variant of the lodger
story was heard in a Melbourne court the
other day. The defendant was being sued
on some promissory notes by a man in whose
house he had been staying. The p.n.’s,
according to the plaintiff, had been given
for board and lodging, the bills for which
had piled up while the reckless youth had
been losing his money at the races. The
debtor’s yarn was quite different. He said
he had been caught by the husband kissing
his wife, and had been so alarmed by threats
of divorce proceedings that he had signed
the documents on the assurance that, if lie
promised not to offend again, the incident
would be forgotten, and the p.n.’s would
merely be held for use if he broke his con-
tract. Part of the bargain had been that
lie should stay on as a boarder; but the treat-
ment he had received had been so poor that
he had finally bolted, and the pressure for
the payment of the p.n.’s followed. He
hinted darkly that two other lodgers in the
house had been similarly trapped; but as he
produced no evidence to support his story,
the case went against him.
* * * *
“E.J.H.”: The long arm of coincidence
was in good working order a few weeks back
on Eyre’s Peninsula (S.A.), when the guard
of a goods train running from Port Lincoln
to Thevenard put his hand through a pane
of glass and severed a blood vessel. The
accident happened just as the tram pulled
up at a siding. At the same time a motor-
car entered the yard, the driver mistaking
it for one of the numerous places where the
road crosses the railway. Seeing liis mis-
take the driver was turning tne car to get
back to the road, when a man rushed ex-
citedly from the train asking where the
nearest doctor was. to be found, xour
luck’s in,” was the reply. "lie s right here.
There was a doctor in the car, and alter
surgical assistance the patient was able to
continue his journey. The nearest resident
doctor lived 60 miles away. #
“Iford”: This talk of place-names and
their origin reminds me that the early-day
nomenclaturists of the W.A. goldfields could
never Quite make up their minds wliethei
the possessive “s” should be left oil the name
of a town christened after the pioneer pros-
pector. “Bayley’s Find” became Coolgardie,
and Hannan’s became Kalgoorlie, but a
minor railway station at the latter centre
remains Hannans to this day, although tne
street at the top of which it stands never
troubled about the final consonant. Lawlers
developed from Lawler’s Find, or Rush, or
Patch, and only the apostrophe was dropped.
By all these analogies Cue’s Find should
have become Cues, but it never did ; it was
always plain Cue, which gave rise to a legend
in England that the field had been discovered
by a billiard-marker out of a job. Some-
times, when the prospector's name was over-
rich in terminal sibilance, there was a des-
perate attempt to get over the difficulty as,
for example, by making Higgins s Higgms-
ville”. —surely the dead limit in the vm-
euphonious. And there are occasionally
alleged native names like . Bangemall and
Youanme which may be nothing of the sort.

“Hamil” : When I was in charge of a ward
at one of the base hospitals in France we
always took special care of men who had
recovered from slight injuries and might have
missed their turn for leave through being
admitted to hospital. Before every “push”
these men were tested, and if their blood
was found suitable they were kept in readi-
ness to be tapped in the interests of some
casualty who was nearly out to it. The re-
ward for this branch of service, after a few
days in bed, was three weeks’ “Blighty”
leave. We were never short of volunteers
to part with some of their blood for that.

"Sorry, sir. but Miss ’Crepe do Chine told

“Queen Street”: One Yic. township at
least is named after a pub. When the Gee-
long'to Ballarat railway line was being laid
a sailor went into the tanglefoot business
and christened his tavern the Navigator's
Inn. The settlement which grew up around
was known as the Navigators, but the Rail-
way Department dropped the article and cut
off the final “s.” Gou Id, a railway station
on the Moe-Wa'lhalla line, was named after
the Bung who kept the Cecil Inn, on the
coach road from Moe to Moondarra. But the
old hands knew him better as Roast-Beef.

Melbourne University loses its oldest in-
habitant through the resignation of E,
Glad is h, who has looked after the Medical
School library for nearly 50 years. His
mind was the best index the library pos-
sessed, and a testimonial of a substantial
form is being raised amongst grads and
undergrads against the time when his resig-
nation becomes effective—at the end of the
year. The University’s chief librarian,
Ulrich, by the way, will go out at the same
time.
F. W. Paterson, Rhodes Scholar and bril-
liant graduate of Queensland ’Varsity, was
one of the fieriest speakers during the rail-
way strike in the North. Born at Glad-
stone (0.Q.), he and his brother Charlie
went to Rockhampton Grammar School, and
headed the State in the Junior and Senior
Public respectively. Charlie was sent a
while back by the Queensland Government
to study timber matters in U.S.A. F.W.
was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship, went
to Oxford a meek boy beloved of church
dignitaries, and returned an atheist and red-
hot Socialist. His aim is, of course, Parlia-
ment, and he will contest the Gladstone seat
at the next election. Still well under 30,
he is slightly built and partly bald, and is
a brilliant talker.
General McNichol, beloved of all, was
making his usual brigade inspection. With
characteristic thoroughness he was cat-
echising the men. “Where is your identity-
disc?” he asked a
section sergeant,
“jin my pocket,
sir,” was the reply.
“Now,” detonated
the Brig, “how can
you conscientiously
tell your men that
the right place for
the identity-disc
is round the neck
when you carry
your own in your
pocket?” Then in
an aside to Gap-
tain Wardell: “But
I wouldn’t like him
to ask me where
mine is at present.”

J. J. ASTOR, M. P.,

Gone where he’ll hear the clamorous
printer no more, Henry James Taperell, who
has been part of Sydney journalism for a
quarter of a century. He came from Maori-
land to join the Daily Telegraph in its
virile days, and did some striking work as
Parliamentary hand, dramatic critic and
leader-writer. After a spell as editor of the
Dominion (M.L.), he became news-editor
of the King-street sheet, then passed on to
the Evening News, Sunday Times and
Guardian before retiring to his garden at
Waitara to do an occasional article for the
Red Page—he had long been a Bulletin
contributor. Of the old school, widely read,
with a quiet, dry humor and a bottomless
fund of anecdote, “Tap” was one of the best-
loved men in the newspaper world, and the
craft is the poorer for his passing.
Mrs. A. W. Foster, who died in Melbourne
last week, was one of the five prominent
membei-s of the Women’s Political League
who aimed at getting women into the
State Parliament—to be exact, at getting
Vida Goldstein there. Of course Vida was
one of the quintette—she is now in England,
and spiritualism is her chief interest. Cecilia
Johns is also in England. The other three
married: Adela Pankhurst became Mrs. Tom
Walsh, and another is the wife of Labor-man
Maurice Blackburn.
The Christian Brothers and their boys
have just celebrated the golden jubilee of
Brother Bari-on, 22 years provincial of the
Order iix Australia, by erecting a handsome
roinanesque chapel at the Brothers’ Training
College, Strathfield (N.S.W.). When Brother
Bari’on became provincial in 1902 there were
34 houses in his congregation in Australia
with only 130 brothers. To-day there are
70 houses and 350 brothers. The jubilarian
is a Tipperary man, but he has been in Aus-
tralia half a century.
Joe Ward’s mana is great in Invercai*gill,
which he will contest at Maoriland’s forth-
coming election ; but ho will have for a rival
a soldier of note, Lieut.-Colonel James
Hargest, born near Gore (Southle ■ 34
years ago. Hargest
left his father’s
farm to join up
with MaorilancTs
main body in 1914,
and before he was
out of khaki he
had collected the
M.C., the D.S.O.
and the French
Legion of Honor.
On his return he
got into farm togs
again, and soon be-
came a big figure
in land matters in
the Shivery Isles.

Percy Coleman, M.11.R. for Reid, whose
attack on J. J. Garvan’s dual connection
with the Mutual Life and Citizens’ and the
Commonwealth Bank made a recent politi-
cal sensation, graduated from the Austra-
lian Clerical Association, of which he was
secretary; lie held the rather unique record
of becoming chief executive officer for a
union from which some years before he had
been expelled. The expulsion took place at
a stormy time in the union’s history, Cole-
man’s offence being in writing to the press
to inform members who had stayed away
that a section of the union had organised a
“packed” meeting, and thereby defeated a
former secretary. Since he was a boy of 14,
Coleman, who was horn in Maoriland, has
battled for himself, his early experience
being at sea. He has an idea that he wasn’t
born to be drowmed. Once an involuntary
wetting caused an illness which sent him to
hospital; so the ship had to sail without
him —and she w r as never heard of after leav-
ing Sydney. Subsequently he became a
clerk in the Seamen’s Union office, and, fol-
lowing night courses of study, qualified as
an accountant, though one would never have
guessed it from his handling of thg Garvan
matter.
Pollard, the young Vic. Laborite from
Dalhousie who was rebuked last year by
the Speaker for taking off his coat in the
House on a hot day, was responsible for
the strike of railway refreshment-room wait-
resses last week. On “grievance day” re-
cently he fussed over an adverse comment
w’hich Oswald Carter, inspector of refresh-
ment-rooms. made about three waitresses in
an out-back Mallee station tearoom, and
tried to give it a general application. Eggles-
ton, Minister for Railways, at once dis-
counted the statement, and said that in any
case it w T as contained in a confidential report
which Pollard had used unfairly. The Rail-
way Union worked up the necessary indigna-
tion, and the dailies fanned the flame by
liberal publicity. Then came the silly, short-
lived strike and the equally silly demand for
the dismissal of Carter.

10/9/’25). I correspond regularly with
Mrs. Charmian London, widow of the novel-
ist, and only lately received a letter from her
dated Glen Ellen, California, June 23, 1925,
in which she stated that there was a lot of
work to be done on that estate, and that she
had an immense amount of literary labor in
hand. There was no mention of a return to
Australia. As for “Granny” London, she
is dead.
The last of a once-notable schoolmaster
family has gone—William Wliinham, aged
<S3. Wliinham College in North Adelaide
was a famous institution in its day. Robert,
its founder, was killed while riding a spirited
horse, and William was an unconventional
guide for youth. He once attempted a corner
in wheat, and was dreadfully surprised when
it didn’t come off.
The new Mayor of Fitzroy (Vic.), Coun-
cillor A. Rosen, is the municipal linguist of
Australia. He writes and speaks, beside
English, Hebrew, German, French and
Italian, and is something of a Latin scholar.
W.A. has never exhibited any marked love
for artistic monuments; so long as a
memorial had legs and arms and a poise it
passed. But Bertram Mackennal, no less,
has been commissioned to execute a statue of
the late John Forrest, nine or more feet in
height. It will stand in King’s Park.
Mrs. Ross Watt, of Gisborne, the first
woman in Vic. to be elected a shire coun-
cillor, has just spoken her maiden speech at
a council meeting. The new president of
that shire is David G. O’Donnell, former sub-
inspector of Melbourne detectives. A native
of Gisborne, on retirement he settled as a
farmer on his native heath. He is still writ-
ing his reminiscences of 30 years of C.I.D.
service.
A casual observer would scarcely notice
that Mick O’Keefe, Speaker of the* Speck’s
Parliament, functions without a wig. He
is blessed with a plentiful crop of white
hair, -which flows in gracious waves about
liis massive head. He runs to flesh, and some
time ago began to seek a means of reducing
weight. Dieting did not appeal, and skipping
is hardly dignified for an 18-stone legislator.
So he bought a place of five acres at his be-
loved Beaconsfield and set out as a market
gardener. He dug the five-acres himself,
disdaining to use a plough for the preliminary
turn-over. Result was a lighter* healthier-
looking and infinitely fitter Michael for the
recent election campaign. He has won
Wilmot, thanks mainly to Lyons’s second
preferences, ever since 1912.
A young man that Amundsen might like
to get his hands on is Sidney Cotton, lately
returned to Sydney from England after hav-
ing his invention, the Sidcop flying-suit,
adopted by the British Air Force. In 1920
Cotton went to Newfoundland to find the
secret of flying over ice-wastes in winter.
He was prepared to spend three years in
the .search, but: found what he was after
within 12 months, and with a temperature
40 below zero never had to deal with a
frozen-in machine. Most of his flying was
done in Shackleton’s Baby Avfo, after lie
had practically reconstructed it. Some of
the young man’s deeds comprise 200 miles
non-stop seaplaning over Labrador’s ice-
deserts, delivering mails in five hours that
took dog-teams 82 days, and a little air jaunt
from London to Capetown.
Perhaps there isn’t so much sectarianism
about as some pessimists think. Anyway, at
the final of the college boxing competitions
between Christian Brothers and Si, Peter’s,
Adelaide, the representative of the latter, a
C. of E. institution, was a Roman Catholic,
while the champion of the R.C. college
wasn’t. The Saints’ man, by the way, was
Coles, a grandson of old Speaker Jenkin.
L. A. Adamson, of Wesley College, Mel-
bourne, who has suggested that “inverted”
Rhodes scholarships should be established in
the Dominions for British students, is one of
the most progressive of Vic. public-sc,hool
headmasters. His idea is that if each Aus-
tralian State took one or two British stu-
dents at a time for a couple of years’ (part-
of-his-training). course at the Uni. a good
corrective for insularity would be provided.
There .would thus, he thinks, be some sort
of reciprocity for the Rhodes scholarships.
But. finance is the trouble. Peacock, Vic.
Minister for Education, says there wouldn’t
bo much trouble about the free places at the
’Varsity if some local Rhodes or a few organ-
isations would find the cash for maintenance,
exes, and fares.
Back to Melbourne after two years in the
cold are two young educationalists, Dr. Chris
Mcßae and Arthur Phillips, who graduated
from that ’Varsity in 1922 and were nomi-
nated for free passages to England. Dr.
Mcßae, who is a son of a Vic. inspector of
schools, took his Ph.D. at London Uni. with
a thesis on the problem of mental defectives.
A. A. Phillips, son Of the Master in Equity,
worked under the great educationalist Michael
Sadler at University College, Oxford. He is
taking a temporary job on the staff of
Wesley College.
Peter Reidy, the latest S. Aus. M.P. to
receive a writ from Attorney-General Bill
Denny for alleged slander in connection with
the Thousand Homes scheme, had a remark-
able entrance into politics. In 1914 Reidy
was a John Hop in a south-eastern town. A
strong supporter of the Labor party, he
soon acquired by his keenness and eloquence
a certain reputation in the district. This
by no means pleased the then Liberal Premier
—the late Archie Peake—who was one of
the members for the south-eastern district.
A sudden and unexpected removal convinced
lieidy he was suffering for his political be-
liefs. Resigning from the force he con-
tested the 1915 elections, and had the double
satisfaction of topping the poll and seeing
Peake among the also-rans. Splitting with
Labor on the conscription issue, he is the
sole surviving Nationalist in the House. Not
bound by party ties, he is always assured
of a good hearing by all members except a
small portion of the Labor crowd.
Professor Ernest Rutherford, who last
came this way to
attend the Science
Congress in 1914,
is back again in
Australia, en route
to Maoriland, his
home country. Nel-
son College will be
a proud school if
he pays it a visit;
from that pic-
turesque hive he
won a scholarship
which took him to
the N.Z. Univer-
sity in 1890, when
he was 19. Thence
he gradually moved
into the position of
the most famous
English - speaking
physicist of the day.
Sir ERNEST
RUTHERFORD,
O.M., the world-
renowned
scientist, note on
a visit to Aus-
tralia and his
native Maoriland.
J. W. Murrell, of Geelong and Melbourne
Uni., designed sewerage schemes for Colac.
Horsham and Lome (Vic.), had two years
with Geelong waterworks, and for the last
year or so has been assistant-engineer at
Hobart. Now he moves on to Adelaide as
sewerage engineer. And he is barely 23.
“Adamascus” : Perhaps political and other
associations on the opposite side of the fence
will see a lesson in this. The outstanding
feature of the meetings of the railway em-
ployees during the recent strike in Queens-
land was the excellence of the talkers —ex-
cellent, that is, judged by the manner in
which they did what they wanted to do. Of
11 speakers whom I heard in Rockhampton
only one could be called poor. And, with
the exception of two, they were not men
hired to talk, but railway workers represent-
ing their various unions. The two exceptions
were F. W. Paterson and F. Gordon Crane,
All of the speakers spoke simply and directly
and marshalled their facts like experienced
debaters. Crane, a graduate of Queensland
University, the local Workers’ Educational
Association tutor, for some time past has
conducted lunch-hour lectures and nightly
debates amongst workers, particularly raii-
waymen; and it was he chiefly who taught
them how to use their tongues.
“L.E.” : Some extraordinary nonsense has
been written about our pioneer artist, Louis
Buvelot, some of whose works were shown
in the Loan Exhibition in Melbourne. He
has been described as ’‘eccentric,” “unconven-
tional” and “improvident,” a “battered ideal-
ist who died in poverty and obscurity at
Fitzroy 40 years ago.” Nothing could be
further from the truth. Buvelot was a friend
of Corot, and went to Brazil, where he was
by way of being Court painter till the Court
ceased to exist. Coming to Australia, he
started as a photographer, but one day a
picture he had placed in his shop window
was instantly bought, and from that time
to the day of his death he -was the leading
artist in the country, selling every picture
he ever painted at quite good prices for those
days. He was a gentle, cultured man, who
lived a quiet, happy life without strain or
worry. Instead of the “battered idealist”
dying in poverty and obscurity, he was rather
the type of the fortunate artist. His only
“eccentricity” was that he liked to make his
own coffee.
Just died at Gisborne (M.L.) James Wil-
liam Witty, whose first adventure in Aus-
tralia was to join in the search for the lost
explorers Burke and Wills. Later he
hunted gold up and down Maoriland. Once,
while following the trail of the Hauhaus as
a lieutenant of militia, he had with him a
party of friendly Maoris. Among them w r as
a solid little block of brawn of 13 with his
rifle on his shoulder. It was youug Jimmy
Carroll, who grew up to be a knight and
native Minister in many Administrations.
GODS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m not impious, but it seems to me
The gods men pray to would be strange to see.
Observe the plural—-gods is quite correct;
Each has his own, fair-made and circumspect.
The priest commands them kneel, and kneel they do
To pray to gods unknown to me or you.
Good gods, I grant; convenient, no doubt,
To speed a horse or cure a touch of gout:
Prolong a war or strafe the horrid foe;
Make r>’"' , ’"s rise, rain fall and turnips grow;
Turn -J gold or,make an oil-bore gush;
Brin .id to beau and bawling babies hush;
Cure mangy colts; produce a boundary hit;
W ork miracles to stay a poodle’s fit;
Give summer days, but keep ice on the rink;
Make ounces pounds and sallow people pink;
Woo contrite hearts; find solace for remorse ;
Make grounds for football, weddings and divorce;
Shoot Kaisers, smother kings; pour oil on rage;
Reduce superfluous flesh; increase the wage—
So many gods there are as words that rhyme;
Tis good there’s many; one would tire in time.
And good, in view of limits to the shelf,
That each man’s god is simply each man’s self.

"Dad, I ain't going to school any more.”
“Eh, why?”
“It’s no bally good—I can't learn to spell. The teacher keeps
changing the words.”
“The Rumpus” : In the hilly country be-
tween New Koreia and Bolgart (W.A.) an old-man
kangaroo ate the grass for over 4'o years. He grew
enormous, and many hunters attempted to capture
him, but he eluded them until the day of pouring
rain when P. Marlowe rode unexpectedly upon him.
Badger, Marlowe’s black staghound, surprised the
massive hopper. Disdaining tree-trunks and high
rocks to place his back against, the ’roo met them
in the open. Marlowe urged his pony near, swing-
ing the usual weapon—stirrup and strap. But his
quarry’s head towered above his own and he did not
fancy the high strike. He then dismounted and
heaved a stone about 21b. in weight that thumped
into the ’roo’s ribs. Another throw hit him fair
on the side of the head, and the dog, springing a
second later, overwhelmed him. In rushed Marlowe
with liis big clasp-knife open, and, seizing the right
moment, slashed the ’roo’s throat. The poor brute
flung the dog aside and rose again, his half-severed head
hanging backward. Opee more the black staghound
sprang, and the pair rolled over down a sharp incline.
Quickly following, Marlowe attempted to stand on
the ’loo’s head, but one tremendous kick sent him-
yards away, the sleeves of his shirt, coat and over-
coat ripped, and his arm gashed open. After that
Marlowe was content to let his dog finish the job.
The next day the carcase Was quartered and carted to
the nearest cocky’s home. It weighed 10921 b.

"Fresh Rabbi’ ” : Some time ago I saw a
ra bbit skinned in eight seconds, or at the rate of
seven bunnies a minute. I thought the feat remark-
able, and last week told it to a trapper. “Gor’s
truth,” said he, “how many smokos did the bloke'
have?” Will some Abo. tell me what is considered
>8 bo a really good tally?
* * * *
"Chumos”: Though Queensland can boast
no wild animals, southern sportsmen could do worse
than spend a day or two at Cowan Cowan, on More-
ton Island, which abounds in wild pigs. Their
domesticated progenitors escaping from captivity
many years ago, the progeny have developed the
long legs and the long, needle-pointed tusks of the
wild pig of India. Armed with a .22, and on foot,
with a small pack of trained clogs, I have hunted
the porkers with much success. On the reverse side,
when unaccompanied by my dogs I have spent
several weary hours in a small tree, held up by
a tusker.

“Jim Carew”: “The Rumpus” (Tl.
27/8/’25) says he has frequently seen masses of
cockatoos flying in different directions meet in mid
air without a causalty. I can assure him that when
two flocks of cockatoos do meet in this way, the
i ontact is nearly always followed by casualties.’ In-
stances of a dozen or more birds being injured in
• a collision are frequent, and it was only the extra-
large number of injured in the crash I described
that drew me into comment. From my observation of
cockatoos, gleaned principally on the far-south coast
of N. S. Wales, I am of opinion that a flying flock
is as jealous of its right-of-way as a motor hog is
of his right to the road, and a flock in ftill flight
will nbt alter its course except for danger coming
from humans,
* * * *
“Jesmond”: The fact that stock always
make for top-dressed paddocks (B. 20/8/’25) has
been noticed by all
observant cookies, and
this tendency has been
utilised in parts of
Gippsland to destroy
bracken. A year or
two ago a report from
M.L. stated that super-
phosphate had been
used in the destruction
of bracken, and the
opinion was expressed
that the top-dressing
made the coarse ferns
palatable to cattle. M-y
own observation has
shown that the bracken
is destroyed not by
the stock eating it, but
by their trampling it
down while searching
for the “super.’-’ On
Phillip Island (Vie.)
there .are sandy rises
now carrying a good
sole of "> native and
English grasses which
a few years ago were
a mass of tangled fern.
Each year they have
had a heavy top-dress-
ing of superphosphates
followed in a month or
six weeks by a fire to
clear the ground of the
dead ferns and give the
grass-seed left by the
cattle a chance to take
root and grow. This
plan is especially useful
where timber makes it
awkward or even im-
possible to use a mow-
ing machine, and an
my opinion it makes
a better job of it, for
the fertiliser, missed by
the cattle is washed
into the ground and
is on the spot ready to
nourish the young grass
which shoots up after
the fire has been over the ground.
- * * * *
“Ratio”: “Sierra” is wrong when he says
(B. 20/8/’25) that in the southern hemisphere the
summer is hotter and the winter colder than in
the northern. True, the amount of solar heat re-
ceived by the south is greater owing to the fact that
the southern summer coincides with the perihelion
position of the earth. But to argue that therefore the
southern summer is hotter is to ignore the facts that
south of the line the ratio of water to land surface
is greatly in favor of the former, and that water
has a much greater specific heat than land. In
Australia the 70-deg. isotherm stretches as far south
as 30deg., but in the western States of U.S.A. the
corresponding isotherm goes as far north as 41deg.
and in practically all the part of Asia s. of 40deg.
N. the mean annual temperature is above 70deg. A
comparison of coast towns at which the climatic
conditions of latitude, etc., are similar gives the
same result. Thus, Adelaide has an m.s. temperature
of 73deg., and m.w. 63deg., as compared with Tolcio
DOING TITS BEST.
“Hold his head, can’t yer!”
“Aint that what I’m doing?"
74deg. and 39deg.; and Hobart (61deg. and 47deg.)
is both cooler in summer and warmer in winter than
Marseilles (70dcg. and 45deg.) and Vladivostock
(64deg. and lldeg.). The fact is that the northern
hemisphere has a slightly hotter summer and a
slightly colder winter than the southern. The less
rigorous winter is due to the modifying influence of
the great southern water masses.
* * * *
“Six and Eight”: The dispute between
“Mulga” and “Orange” (B. 27/8/’25) is understand-
able because the name “catfish” is applied to many
genera and species of Siluroidece. But while “Mulga”
has no authority for his use of the term, “Orange”
has that of Douglas Ogilby and T. 0. Roughley,
both of , whom use it as he does. The ova of the
river catfish are fertilised by the male in the body
of the female, who then makes a kind of nest of
gravel and small stones in which she deposits them.
When a boy I often saw them making nests in the
Talbragar River near Dubbo, and watched the singu-
lar way in which, during the incubation period, both
tnale and female guard the nest and drive off
intruders. Murray cod and catfish are caught in the
same waters, while the name jewfish is properly only
used to describe the voracious and predatory Sciciena
antarctica, which inhabits salt water.
“T.A.C.”: “Buttenderry” (B. 27/8/’25) says
he has evidence of catfish caught in stagnant
waters being • poisonous. The Lachlan, where this
species abounds, is more or less stagnant for nine
months of the year, yet I have never heard of the
fish giving any trouble as a food. On the contrary,
it is considered by at least 90 p.c. of its eaters to
be far superior to any other fresh-water variety.
* * * *
“Henry Pannikin”: The family at Shingle
Hut was at tea when the Rev. Silas Wobkins arrived.
Mum did a hurried flitter and shoved the bottle of
beer under the kitchen-dresser. The parson' was
invited in and the meal progressed. “Weather looks
bad again,” said Dad to the visitor. “Yes,” replied
the Rev. Wobkins; “we’ll get some more hail, 1
think.” “’Ain’t a ’ope,” broke in young Joe at the
foot of the table; “Mum ’id it under the dresser,
and the dorg’s just capsized it.”
* * * *
“Pyrox”: Although the natural call of the
dingo is the eerie and long-drawn-out howl which
sounds so banshee-like when heard in the bush by
night, he sometimes gives voice to a short, sharp
bark, especially in districts where there is contact
with domesticated dogs. Notwithstanding that the
average dog seems to have not much time for the
dingo, a bitch in a* bush camp will attract
the dingoes in the neighboring scrub. Probably the
bark that is sometimes heard is an effort on
the part of the dingo to imitate the sound made
by the domestic dog; but, apparently, the former’s
vocal mechanism is not adapted to barking, for
it never gets very far beyond the rudimentary
stage. Still, it will try. An old bush mate of
mine owned a dingo -which had been c-aught in a
trap when a full-grown pup. Instead of killing
it he repaired its damaged paw and reared it, with
the result that it followed him like a dog. In
course of time it acquired a low bark, almost like
that of the ordinary dog', apparently learned from
the other canines belonging to its master.
* * * *
"Slam”: I will back the black darter or
snake-bird against any nomination among the shags,
ducks or cormorants as an under-water stunt artist.
I’ve watched these birds in action on the lagoon just
behind the Rockhampton (Q.) botanical gardens,
and am certain that they dive fully 50 yards. When
alarmed, they swim with the whole body submerged,
and only the long black neck stretched out above
water, greatly resembling the action of a swimming
snake. I have found only one nest, a slight stick
platform in a ti-tree overhanging the swamp. In
it were four queer youngsters in bright yellow down,
with the long-billed heads not as wide as the neck.
They vomited half-digested fish at me and then
•tumbled into the water and dived at once. Although
they were quite without feathers, they were all
back in the nest next day, and I concluded thar
the old birds had carried them there.
* * * *
“Nor’-West” : “Rex’s” American friend (B.
27/8/’25) is wrong when he states that the American
bison will not cross with domesticated cattle. Experi-
ments are being carried out in Canada, and an
animal named the cattalo has been evolved. In
“Countries of the World” appears a chapter on
Canada by E. B. Osborn, in which he describes the
cattalo as the progeny of two hybrids, bred from
buffaloes and domestic cattle. These animals arc
being reared to stock the northern prairie lands, where
the domestic cattle need too much attention in a
rigorous climate to be profitable. It is claimed for
the cattalo that it withstands disease and faces storms
instead of drifting with them. The hybrid has the
shaggy torso of the bison, but the hump is modified,
and it is covered with more and denser hair; the
barrel and hindquarters are heavier than the bison’s,
thus giving promise of better beef and fattening
qualities.
“Ajjy”: “Ilex’s” American friend (B. 27/8/’25 )
is wrong in saying that bisons do not cross with
domestic cattle. At the Buffalo Park, near Wain-
Wright, Alberta, bison bulls are crossed with Here-
ford, Shorthorn and Aberdeen Angus cows. The
offspring is the hybrid buffalo. Two hybrids pro-
duce the cattalo. The cattalo has a good hide, can
weather the storms easily and thrive on very scanty
pasture. There have been many difficulties, it is
true; e.g., getting the bulls to mate with the alien
cows. This was overcome by putting bison calves
with domestic cows, thus getting them used to each
other. Many of the bull calves are born dead or
may be infertile. The yak crosses readily and safely
with domestic cattle and with bison dams.
* * * *
“Coppertop” : I cannot agree with “Nitric"
(B. 27/8/’25) that the sea anemone does not paralyse
its victims. I carried out some interesting experi-
ments on the rocks, at low tide, on Balmoral beach,
Sydney. There one will find anemones surpassed in
beauty only by those on the Barrier Reef. I col-
lected a tin of shrimps from a near-by hole and,
one at a time, dropped them into the heart of an
anemone. They were paralysed immediately. Some
that were rescued were stiff, and when placed in
another pool took as long as half an hour to revive.
I noticed that the first one dropped into the anemone
took longer to revive than did the second, and the
second took longer than the third or fourth, which
also proves that the strength of the paralysing power
diminishes with repeated use. I do not know
whether it is “marine instinct” or not, but when a
small shell was dropped in instead of a shrimp, the
anemone lost no time in casting it out.

SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The weeks have been long and dull were the days,
And slow were our feet as we went on our ways,
And heavy our garments flapped when we went forth
In the .sleet from the south or the wind from the
north.
Long nights we have brooded, in no mood to sing;
Hut poor is the heart that is dumb in the Spring.
The leaf is unfolding-, and full is the bud;
The warmth of the sun is like wine to our blood;
And sombre green gum-leaves are red at the tips,
Like stately young- ladies with rouge on their lips ;
And Cupid gets ready his arrows to fling—
Romance is awakening- to welcome the Spring.
There’s bloom on the almond, and peas in the pod
Lie huddled together like bricks in a hod;
No tinge yet of yellow is there in the grass
That tempts the stray horses and cattle that pass,
While sweet-scented daphne and roses that cling
Outrival the violets that bloom in the Spring.
Soft-skinned are the children, with pink on their
cheeks,
And gone are the colds that have lingered for weeks.
The magpies are mating and nesting in trees,
Their song seems to blend with the hum of the bees ;
And high overhead there’s a hawk on the wing,
A speck in a sky that is blue in the Spring.
We sigh not for fortunes the future may bring,
Nor joys of to-morrow—to-day it is Spring.
Our years seem to measure with those of a boy,
We seek riot for leisure, each task is a joy.
The words run together like beads on a string,
And poor is the pen that is idle in Spring.
The working men whistle for joy that they feel
As they walk to their work, or they pedal awheel,
And singing and laughter wafts in from the road
As a ear passes by that has youth for a load.
Aye, old is the heart that is too old to sing
When the land is decked out in the mantle 6f Spring.

Are you tisin.£? the
The condition of roads and tracks throughout the Commonwealth are mostly bad,
and not in keeping with the latest method of road transport. In older countries
road construction is more up-to-date and has been brought more into line with the
needs of the automobile. Oversea tyre manufacturers naturally build tyres to suit
the up-to-date concrete and bitumen covered highways in their own country.
Some of those tyres find their way to Australia, and are expected to stand up to
the pot-holey, stony and rutty roads abounding in this country. Naturally they
would give better service if specially constructed for Australian conditions, but they
are not. It’s different with Australia’s premier tyre _the Dunlop. This product of
Australian industry is the result of over 20 years of careful study and actual testing
to overcome the tyre stresses incidental to motoring in this country. The essentials
required before tyres are dependable on our roads are non-chipping rubber tread,

DUNLOP TYRES
score so heavily. They are specially made for a specific job, and they succeed in
doing it better than any imported tyre, and it is not surprising when one considers
the matter. Not only does the Dunlop give you better service, it also gives you
greater value, as it costs you less to buy, consequently stands supreme for economy.
Motorises who desire tyre satisfaction can be certain of it by purchasing Dunlop
Cords. Stocked by leading Garages in all sizes and types. New list on application.

CALCIUM CYANIDE
FOR. RABBIT EXTERMINATION.
&
FUMO
BRAND
*
For the application of
CALCIUM CYANIDE, the
Fumo Dust Blower is re-
commended. Easy, safe
and convenient to use.
CALCIUM CYANIDE is the surest, the speediest and the
most economical means of clearing your acres of the rabbit
pest.
A. J. H. Elliott, Bank of New South Wales, Yass. N.S.W.,
writes, 19th May, 1924: “With reference to your method
of Babbit Destruction with ‘Fumo’ Calcium Cyanide Dust,
1 have read your pamphlets and testimonials with interest,
but' have not noticed any mention about using the machine
on rabbit logs. I have, when not con-
venient to burn, fumigated logs with the
dust. Three or four puffs will do the
trick in, say, from 10 to ao seconds, and
there is no need to block up the ends.
Some of the logs treated have been rotten
and full of cracks from end to end, but
the result is the same. I have also success-
fully treated deep crevices in rocks with-
out blocking up in any way. So what sort
of a chance has ‘bunny’ in a burrow that
can be sealed!”

“John Sing”: “Trevdee” (B. 13/8/’25)
has not unearthed the world’s champion bag-sewer.
In 1919, at Ouyen (Vic.), C. R. Lockwood sewed
1003 bags with 15 stitches to the bag in a day.
He started at 5 a.m., and with breaks of 30 minutes
for breakfast, 20 for lunch, an hour for dinner and
20 minutes for afternoon tea, finished the last bag
at 8.10 • p.m. I filled the bags, and my nipper had
charge y of ■ the water into which the needle was
dipped every now and again when it became un-
comfortably warm to finger.

“Cosmo”: What about this? A crossbred
ewe, reared as a pet and belonging to Mrs. D. South-
well, of Oolong, near Dalton, will be 11 years old
next September. She has had 18 lambs, including
eight pail's of twins. During the last 12 months
she increased the sheep statistics by four. One
set of twins made their first “baa” in August last
year, and another pair in June this year. For eight
years the ewe cut 191 b. of wool annually. One of
her lambs, when killed and dressed, weighed 1301 b.,
the caul fat tipping the scale at 101 b.

“Jimmy Possum”: “Tarago” (B. 6/8/’25)
asks if it is generally known that cattle depastured
on young oats are liable to turn up their hoofs
suddenly. It is common knowledge with experienced
dairymen, who would no more think of turning hungry
milkers into a paddock of very young green-stuff
than they would of mixing strychnine with their
tucker. I know of one case in which a bullocky
lost nearly all his team through (turning the
toilers overnight into a paddock of young sow-
thistles. Too much green feed of tender growth of any
sort is likely to cause trouble, particularly if the
cattle have been running on dry country. The
effect is generally worse if the green-stuff happens
to be wet with either dew or rain.
«• * * #
“Bu (tenderry” : “Billo C.” (B. 27/8/’25) is
probably correct in stating that black is the
primitive color of sheep, otherwise it would be
difficult to account for its frequent recurrence when
one considers the extraordinary pains taken to
eliminate it. In classing studs, no matter how
perfect an animal may be in other respects, a black
spot on any part of the body, hoofs or even palate
is enough to oust it; yet, in spite of this rigid
selection, black lambs are not infrequently dropped
at different studs. The largest black flock I have
known belonged to the Whites of Scone (N.S.W.).
One of the reasons why this wool was at one time
more valuable than white was the demand for it
by a certain religious order whose garments had to be
made of black, undyed wool. A French buyer regu-
larly bought a few bales of it.
* ■ * * *
“Curlew”: It is my painful duty to im-
peach an old and re-
spected friend. In a
small way my two
acres are a carefully-
preserved bird and ani-
mal sanctuary; but in
spite of all care the
minor feathered guests,
such as doves and wag-
tails, which were once
numerous, are diminish-
ing in number to near
zero. A pair of jack-
asses have inhabited
this retreat for years.
Also, I had an old pair
of fantail pigeons. One
day, a couple of years
ago, finding I had only
one pigeon _left and a
heap of white feathers,
I naturally blamed a
stray eat, but soon
afterwards caught the
Johnnies, red-handed,
eating the second one.
Since then, by careful
.observation, I hav'e
proved that every small
bird’s nest in my little
domain' is visited by
the jackasses as soon as
the young are hatched,
with the result of a
very drastic ■ birth-
control. I am afraid
that all the good quali-
ties which may justly
have been ascribed to
John are offset by his
combining with wild
and tame cats to
locally exterminate the
small insectivorous
birds, which are far
more valuable and
necessary than John A.
is himself, with all his
utilities. Although
butcher-birds are not
blood-guiltless, I was
quite rejoiced yester-
day to see a pair of'
them chasing John A.
for his life. I could
hear his teeth loudly
chattering with fright—and I smiled.

“Broome”: “Colub” relates (B. 23/7/’25)
that he saw a sea snake nearly a mile away from
water. Well, it didn’t get there without help. It
is impossible for sea snakes to travel on land.
During 20-odd years in the Nor’-West I have observed
them under all conditions. While in the diving-
dress I have seen them, when the water has been
clear, attached to coral cups or ferns at a depth of
160 feet. Sometimes they made no movement, and
at other times swam away fairly quickly, but not
at nearly as fast a pace as the most sluggish of
sea fish. On shore, if they ever get a yard or
two above high-water mark, it means a struggle for
HONEST PEOPLE.
COLONEL GRIM (whose shoes have not been cleaned) : “I put my
boots outside the door last night, and they hare not been
touched.”
CHIEF BOTTLE-WASHER OF BCNGIEDOO HOTEL: “Er course not,
Digger! Why, you coulder left your blanky watch chain
out as well, an’ they wouldn’ta been nicked.”
them, and, probably, their end. There seem to be
two distinct varieties on the W.A. coast. One grows
over seven feet long, and is big in girth. It is rather
sluggish, and if caught by its eel-like tail and held
at arm’s length has not the power to raise its head
to tail level. It is a most voracious eater. The
other variety is long, thin, and striped like a tiger-
snake, and is the more active oi the two and also
the more venomous. It can reach your hand if
held up by the tail, and in the water can travel
at a fair pace, and also shows a lot of fight when
it drifts against a diver’s pipe. It will attack again
and again, coiling round and striking, darting away
and repeating the action.
“Deepwater”: Tell “Mulga”(B. 27/8/’25)
that he and not “Orange” is mistaken in the matter
of catfish and jew fish. Catfish and cod certainly do
inhabit the same streams —all the tributaries of the
Darling and Murray system. “Mulga” is perpetuating
a bushman’s misnomer in calling the catfish a jew-
fish. The jewfish name applies properly only to the
well-known denizen of salt water. As to “Butten-
derry’s” yarn that the catfish’s head is poisonous—
well, all I can say is that I have fished in the north-
western rivers for considerably over 30 years, and
have never heard of it before. It may be so, but
what on earth would any one cook a catfish’s head
for? In view of “Buttcnderry’s” horrible experiences
after eating the catfish, I suppose I must consider my-
self lucky, as I have eaten a hundredweight or so
and experienced no ill effects. Next to the cod
and golden perch or “yellow-belly,” the catfish is
widely regarded as the best edible fish in western
waters; in fact, many people on the north-western
rivers will swap, cod for cat.
* * * *
“Arilcurra”: I had been in Centralia
about four weeks and had learned a few words of
“pidgin.” About half a mile from Wooltana I met
a couple of old bucks with rabbit-traps and other-
gear. After “Good day!” I ventured “Which way
you walk?” and was answered by the boy who had
responded to my greeting. He continued to talk to
me, while his mate= —whom I> took to be without
knowledge of “pidgin”—remained silent until 5 the
first boy asked me “Which way you been come up?”
“Longa Moolawatanna,” I replied. In liquid tones
and purest English the hitherto silent one addressed
me; “Did you see any of my fellow-countrymen at
Moolawatanna?” Too startled to grasp the question
I stammered “Er-er I beg your pardon!” “Did-you
see any blackfellouis at Moolawatanna,” he repeated
with such sarcastic emphasis on the “blackfellows”
that I lost ■ the- remainder of my nerve, dug haels
into the horse and got away. The “boy” -was the
far-famed Jacky Fry.
“Wang”: An old German acquaintance of
mine, a cocky living some distance from Geelong
(Vic.), used to drive a bony old horse attached to
a waggonette to town on market days. Underneath
the cart was affixed a crate containing a number of
fowls. For a long time
1 could not understand
why lie carried the
poultry, since he never
seemed to sell them.
But one day, happening
along the road un-
noticed, I carne on old
Sauerkraut underneath
the cart, opposite a
farm house. I watched
developments. He un-
fastened the lid of the
crate, and the chooks,
rushing put, made a
beeline for the farm-
house, where they
quickly mixed in with
the f Avis •belonging to
the place.. The old
simiiSM waited a few
minutes till the mix-up
was pretty thorough,
then ran up to the
house and pitched a
woeful tale of how his
fowls had escaped and
were now chumming
up with Mrs. Cocky’s
poultry. Then Mrs.
Cocky and all the little
cockies sallied forth
and helped the poor
man to recover his lost
property, and, fowls
being bo much alike,
old Sauerkraut got
away with several of
the good lady’s Ply-
mouth Hocks and Leg-
horns, she being none
the wiser at the time.
Later, probably, foxes
were blamed for the
shortage. If she
spotted one of hers be-
ing shoved into tin-
crate, the old man let
it go and apologised.
This we found out
afterwards was a regu-
lar game of his. He’d
take six fowls from
home and come hack
with a dozen and not a
penny spent. Then
somebody put his pot
on. The next time he
lost his fowls. he lost
them for good. The
dogs and the kids had a great time. After that
the crate was never used.
* * * *
“ J.T.T.”: “Polycarp” (B. 4/6/’25) com-
pares the song of the nightingale with the rich notes
of our own butcher-bird and magpie. Every tra-
velled Australian I have conversed with on this sub-
ject has admitted that the English bird wins. The
Australian birds he quotes are very fine songsters,
but the English bird is admitted to be the cham-
pion warbler of all the feathered brigade. What
he says about the English magpie is perfectly true.
But in my time—it ended about 12 years ago—
this bird was rarely to be seen except in some
secluded wood.
A ROMANCE OF THE CREAM
COUNTRY.
DAD: “If you take my girl a way from me
you take all I have to comfort me in
my old aye.”
SUITOR: “Gam! What about all the cows?”
“G.T.C.”: “Rumpus” (B. 23/7/’25) states
that “no black ant has ever been known to climb
a white-ants’ nest.” This is incorrect. Dozens oi
times I have knocked over white-ant nests and found
portion of the nest occupied by black ants. I have
also seen black, white and sugar-ants living in the
one white-ant heap. Another variety of ant, reddish-
brown and slightly larger than the black ant, fre-
quently shares an antheap with the black and
white ants, though more often it appropriates the
Whole nest.
BILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The police are looking for a nan named Bill.”
No, 1 wouldn’t spill the brew, and ! wouldn’t say 1
knew,
And I wouldn't land a cobber in the dock before
the beak,
But I think, in days oi- yore (or it might have been
before),
That I somewhere had a cobber of the name of him
they seek.
Mind, I shouldn’t like to-bet, for the best of us
forget
(It's a sin the little parsons with their gospels
cannot kill) ;
But 1 think I recollect, down the years that Time
has wrecked,
That 1 used to have a cobber of the royal name
of Bill.
And although T cannot swear, cannot place him fair
and square,
Yet I fancy that I met him when my job was
digging drains;
Though 1 also tend to think (rotten memory —or
drink)
That we ate the dust together on the Bogan River
plains.
And perhaps (I may be wrong) it was him that
came along
When I hadn’t half a deencr and the wife was
pretty bad—
Came along and said to me, “I’m a single bloke
and free:
If yer’d take a tenner, Top Bail, I'd be more
than flamin’ glad.”
No, you really cannot tell, for I think I knew him
well
When the hills along by Anzac through the dawning
lowered grim;
But, on second thought, 1 mind that we left that
Bill behind,
Dead asleep upon the £lllllBlO, so it couldn’t well
he him.
Then, again, there was the bloke that we also knew
as Soak,
For the frequency and splendor of a way he had
with beers—
Funny cow, he got a < ross (yes, a wooden one, of
course)
’Cause lie wouldn’t leave a cobber in the mud up
to his oars.
HAD'N THERE.
“Look 'erc, Jan, God can do anything. You caan't name a thing
'E caan't do.”
“Iss, I can.”
“What ez et, then?”
“ ’E cann't maake the clock strike less ‘n wan.”
And I’m thinking, looking back, down the cobber-
parting track,
Counting up the sins and virtues, of the coves 1
knew as Bill,
That I’d not be deeply stirred if the John Hops
missed their bird—
’Cause a Bill, though he’s a sinner, must be some-
ways decent still.

STOCKINGS
So much aristocracy has passed within
their portals this last week that the Femin-
ists are about to add a strawberry-leaf
border to the club’s coat-of-arms. Also they
have put on order a Debrett that members
may be word-perfect the next time a Lady
Primrose or Araminta comes to our
shores. One Feminist quite broke down the
other night when she confessed to overhear-
ing a member address a visitor as “Lady
Astor” instead of “Lady Violet.” Last
Thursday the club attained its social
crescendo. Gathered at the same moment
under its roof were three potentates of the
Press party—Lady Burnham, Lady Violet
Astor and Lady Newnes. There were others
ot our pen-and-ink visitors present, but being
untitled they were untrammelled. Free as
birds of air, they could shuffle amid the
undergrowth of creaking chairs that spread
about the magic ring where Lady Burnham
was busy talking herself into ' laryngitis.
Vlad in a shimmer of silver mail, fashioned
mto a frock that intriguingly wore a little
sleeve on one side and a diamond strap on
the other, the lady (who, incidentally, is
a sister-in-law of “Jersey Lily” Langtry)
protected, her throat, not. with a mere collar
ot gold like Malachi, but with diamonds
about five storeys high. And her ear-rings
and the pearl-centred leaves of her bandeau
made every woman present resolve that a
newspaper proprietor and matrimony might
be looked upon as a promising career, after
There was a great rally of the city’s
earnest sisters to the party (every woman’s
society was represented), and in striking
contrast to the jewelled head-dresses of the
Lngnsh women was the bonnet of Mrs
Orarnes, of the Salvation Army. Lady
V lolet Astor mingled pearls and diamonds in
her necklet, while the pearls worn by Lady
Aewnes contrived to make mere Australians
feel naked. The only one who didn’t bow
the head m secret shame was our own Waley
lady, whose pearls are as good as any. Mrs.
Henson-Infield, another of the visitors in
mauve brocades and silver lace, brooded
over the assemblage, while Ruby Rich,
whose lilac moires were misted over
by a soulful lace cape, wore herself
s-s-s-shmg for quiet during the music
interludes. Miss Preston Stanley, very strik-
ing in gold frocking, poured out a bowl of
verbal cream for the visitors. Sir Frank
A ewnes in the best Australian manner sup-
ported a _ doorpost, while his good-looking
wite (shes a Devonshire lass), quite spon-
taneous-like, repeated the speech she had
made at the TV ayfarers’ dinner an hour or
so before. Mrs. Osbourne England, in black
georgettes, saw that all things worked to-
gether for good. Walter Ivirby’s singing was
as sweet as the scent of pit'tosporum; and
the chuckle of Ethel Osborn’s “Kookaburra”
ys perfection. But it was a pity that out
ot the seven programme numbers by Aus-
tralian composers only two and a half were
given. English and Italian works are always
being heard in London, and Australia’s song-
writers, like her verse-writers, have a note
entirely their own.
The. Press tourists would have been far
more interested if they had dropped into
Lanberra almost any hour of the fortnight
icfore they really did drop in. Never again
say that the Commonwealth Government
can t get a move on! When the day had
been fixed for the picnickers’ visit orders flew
m that at all cost the Senate club-room
must be got ready, for their reception. Plas-
terers were implored to forget that it was
the Sabbath when that day arrived; Tas-
manian blackwood was used for skirting-
boards, and among the articles rushed up
lrom afar was a carpet that cost well up
towards £-00. And in due time the party
arrived and spent exactly 17 minutes over
the inspection ot the whole building!
Having chased ’roos in motor-cars and in-
spected miles of sheep, the Imperial Press
tourists were tootled out to Randwick on
Saturday to see, yet another of our great
national industries. The occasion was Tat-
tersalls Spring meeting, but the sun re-
tused to shine, and under a canopy of grev
the iawns and stands wore the subdued air
that comes from end-of-the-season dressing
Lady Aewnes, however, gave the eye some-
thing in the way of a feast. She looked
WaV^fr 11 ? 011 ° f tlle Great White
Baj . AT kite Kasha and Thibet formed her
costume and wraps, and her small "hat was
of white suede. The Graham lady brought
daughter Jean, and Mrs. Ilenson-Inlield
brooded over the scene rather like a monocled
eagle. Mrs. Lachlan Beaton wore a ruffle
of monkey fur about a slim blue silhouette
and as the day grew colder added a skunk
cape that wore a hundred tails. Ituby
Adams viewed the day over the tall collar of
a mole coat; and the good-looking MacCor-
miek lady was brown, hat and furs and
feather too. Mrs. Colin Stephen was there
with two daughters in white woolly coats
Airs. Hector Clayton’s blue and white rigout
made one think of a Wedgwood ornament *
and surgeon John McKelvey’s lady was an-
other ray of sunshine in a dull afternoon.
The Society of Artists had Lady de Chair
to open its show on Friday. Assisted by a
hat of mixed magenta and black velvet, presi-
dent Ure Smith’s woolly-lamb smile, Thea
Proctor’s Duchess-viewing-the-tenantry atti-
tude and John Lane Mullins’s impressive-
ness, she did it neatly and on time. Captain
Coote aided in the approved manner, and
the Education Gallery was crammed with
buyers, well-wishers and more-or-less artists.
The viking’s lady made a tentative appeai
for painted panels in motor-cars, even as
those worn by our ancestors in their Sedan-
chairs. The vision beautiful flashed before
the mental eye brought joy to the unregen-
erate. Imagine the scenes of familiar life
that would prance about the car of, say, a
leading bookie, dentist, prize-fighter or revue-
show backer! The traffic would be in a
constant state of hold-up, for even the police-
man on point duty is but human. The
Orpens and the John portrait of George Ber-
nard Shaw masquerading as the Sleeping
Beauty drew the multitude; but excepting
the Kerry Girl, Orpen’s females look upset-
ting to the digestion. If you thought out
the day’s bill of fare from breakfast to
dinner you couldn’t find a disli they’d sit
comfortably opposite, though they ' might
easily follow lobster mayonnaise for supper.
Ernest Watt, wearing a shirt pink as a
maiden’s blush, gazed at an ethereal daughter
Pamela in the water-color brew of Thea
Proctor, and B. E. Minus’s girl with the
sovereign hair (it is listed as “Doreen and
the Poet”) was never without its little circle
of gazers. Hardy Wilson’s brown leanness
in the midst of Scotch-mixture tweeds
shepherded a group of fair; Mrs. Beaton and
Ruby Adams were among the latecomers;
so were a group of girl art-students who in-
troduced batik muslins and straw hats to a
gathering mostly befurred.
Violinist Phyllis McDonald got into the
cables the other day by winning the Mann

to listen to

just before the little wonder left.
"The city of travellers’ dreams” one of
the Press visitors has called Sydney; but
Ruby Board took a look over its back fences
the other day at the Women’s Service Club
and found our practice of civic beauty as full
of holes as a sieve. “Fences,” she said,
“don’t mean privacy—they are only ugliness.
In America”—Ruby has just come back from
representing the National Council of Women
at the Conference of the International Coun-
cil at Washington—“the suburban homes
have no dividing walls and fences, only
flowering hedges; the backs of the houses are
as well kept as the fronts, and the master
of each house barbers the little strip of lawn
between his doorstep and the concrete side-
walk. And there are no advertisement hoard-
ings.” Sounds like Arcady, doesn’t it? But
let us bear up; at least we didn’t invent
chewing-gum or the cow-boy movie!
While above Hunter-street Ruby Board
flung out a plea for the city beautiful, the
State’s vice-reine at the Women’s Club
was invoking grace of line in the planning
of our homes and streets. The occasion was
a tea-brew by the Town Planning Assoc.
She breathed her prayer from beneath a blue
velvet hat that topped vellum-toned froek-
ing. Daughter Elaine, who was with her,
cooed from dove-grey swathings. Architect
Mrs. George 'Taylor and 'Mrs. Hyman were
the hostesses of the afternoon. Departing
song-bird Ella Goodman added her soaring-
notes to the afternoon’s music, and Grace
Scobie, of the Public Service, was present,
sanitation in her eye and in her mind a city
whose streets are vacuumed twice a day.
The good-looking lady in this picture is
Mrs. Donald Esplin, who for seven years
has led the
Shore Gram-
mar fete to
victory. Seven
times she has
organised the
fair that year
by year is
bringing th e
school nearer
to the posses-
sion of the
finest and
largest play-
ing fields
among the
city schools.
Her partner in
these designs
on the pockets
of Shore’s
well-wishers is
Mr. Blythe,
also of the
north side.
Four of Mrs. Esplin’s boys are still
at the school, and another who trained
there is now at the Uni. The fete, which
was a flapper’s dream last year, promises to
he better than ever this spring. It will he
held on September 26, and Lord and Lady
Burnham will be the big artillery at the
opening.
. Sydney High School Old Boys were re-united
in jazz and fruit-cup at the Wentworth the
other night, and the paper cap, the lucky
balloon and flowering accessories were given
due importance in the scheme of decoration.
Not that much decoration was needed, the
old Sydneians being famed, even as the
Athenians of old, for their own great beauty.
With each handsome male came one and
sometimes two young maids who’d have
given Helen of Troy a few jealous pangs.
The Eedy couple from Vaueluse (he was pre-
sident of the dance committee) were the
mighty, and sat at a table laden with del-
phinium and mauve stock. Mrs. Eedy wore
a sequined frock as exotic in coloring as
an island night, and smiled on the gathering
about her board, which included the Gram-
mar School Dettmanns and a Julius brother
and sister whose father is the venerable old
dear who bislies at Christchurch in Maori-
land. Every other big school lent a brace
of representatives, and pretty girls in pretty
frocks occurred as frequently as in a Zieg-
feld Folly show.
His name for practical purposes is Eugene.
He’s the man who can make your liair curl
so that it won’t: go limp in a shipwreck;
and his arrival in Sydney has turned the
seamen’s strike into a pale phantom as far
as the straight-haired woman is concerned.
In America six million curls are bestowed by
his firm every year on the just and the un-
just, and his public demonstration of how
it’s done at the King’s Hall oh Tuesday
afternoon was to hundreds the high light
in an otherwise drab week.
There is great joy among the workers for
Rose Day over the success of their prelimi-
nary flutter. Mrs. Lightband organised 1 lie
dance at the Ambassadors; Florrie Howard,
a veteran of the Rose Day offensive, and
Mrs. J. R. Skewes were secretaries; and
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh was president. The
sale of rosebuds (garden, not flapper) during,
the evening put a cheerful glow into the trea-'
surer’s notebook.
Once again last week daffodils from Ivurra-
Jong were turned into minted gold for sweet
charity. The vestibule of Her Majestj '.’s was
the flower-market, and Mrs. Arthur Allen
and Mrs. Ellison Rich were the alchemists
charge. The Twilight homes benefit, and
Mr. tV ark, as usual, was the generous giver.
Sydney is to have its Society of Women
W riters. Meetings have been called and
minutes taken and motions carried, and no-
thing short of a writ of habeas corpus could
now snatch it from us. The sub. is 10s. 6d.
a year, and as 84 women writers have been
tracked the treasurer will have to get a lock
for the cash box straight away. The club
is social or frivolous as opposed to political
or serious. With highbrow and home-brew
women’s clubs raging all about them, the
penwomen, especially the newspaper ones,
felt they couldn’t possibly have eugenics or
welfare hurled at them on their own door-
step, as it were. Mrs. Baverstock is the
first president, and Lady Burnham is to be
the first guest. The membership is pretty
elastic; the list will embrace as catholic a
group as the Institute of Journalists. And
of that it has been said the only thing that
may bar one is the crime (or whatever it is)
ot being a journalist.
T> The n ew Mrs.' D’Arcy Osborne, of Ben
Luckier, Mudgee, probably introduces the
first art note into that pastoral saga. She
was- Gladys -Haycock,- famed -for'her minia-
ture painting, and quite a personage in her
own right. Good-looking, too, she has that
indefinite something that is referred to as
charm. Her father was Captain Thomas
Mountiford Laycock.
Still another scholarship-winner from
Golden Grove faces the Royal Academy next
March. This is good-looking Rhys Kemmis,
who is booked for a farewell concert in
Sydney on the 29th.
Mrs. Monty Severn and Mrs.. Frank Ben-
nett have thrown out a challenge to Time,
and are organising a cabaret at the Ambas-
sadors in the record space of 14 days. The
affair is in aid of the Ashfield Infants'
Home, and the date is the 24th.
Battles will be fought again on Novem-
ber 9 at a re-union dinner of those who took
part in the Sydney-Emden action. Old
hands of the Sydney are asked to get
into communication with Chief Petty-Officer
Hoffam, H.M.A.S. Penguin, Garden Island.
On September 18 and 19 the fair in aid of
the new playing-fields for Trinity Grammar
School, South Ashfield, will be held in the
grounds, 161 Victoria-street. Mrs. Bernard
Berry and Mrs. E. A. Wherrett are the busy
secretaries.
In the report of Sydney’s latest race meet-
ing a long list of Society belles saw them-
selves herded under the heading “Jewelled
Elephants.” Of what avail diet and rubber
corsets if the linotype holds such stabs in
store!
Say Ninety-nine! But add Elizabetk-
street when you are renewing the flowers in
your flat. That’s the address at which Ruby
Coxhead, leader of the Vagabonds, has made
her bow to Commerce. Under the name of
Flora the girl who has helped a thousand
lame dogs over war stiles and post-war stiles
has ventured into business.
Brisbane’s week:—
S’Matthew has been away in the Maryboro’ district,
but returned in time to shake the Empire Press
contingent by the hand. In between he has been
accepting more sticks and inkpots and listening to
Valedictory speeches.
The vocal twins Althouse and Middleton were
greeted by a bumper house at His Majesty’s. Mrs.
Gillies, Mrs. Stanley Chapman, Mrs. Gilbert Wilson
(recovered from a long illness), Mrs. E. It. It. Jordan,
Mrs. Barrington Waters, Mrs. Owen Cowlishaw and
the Bussells were amongst the mtisie-loving throng.
After a long and rushed through-journey from
Cairns, the Allan Wilkie Co. played at Gympie,
took the train on to Brisbane and galloped through
this now peaceful town to stage “The Rivals” in
Ipswich; thence to Toowoomba and Warwick; and
so on and on for ever, till they reach MaOriland on
their way back to Brisbane in 1927.
Judge Blair varied his judicial duties by opening
a fete in aid of the Missions’ Board at Bishopsbourne,
arranged by the Anglicans of St. John’s Cathedral.
Dean de Witt-Batty welcomed the hon. Jimmy, and
the band played and flags fluttered in a friendly wind.
Her Lady-of-Grace Griffith guarded the fancy stall,
where (dainty broidered house linen was on sale, and
Mrs. .Tames Stitt supervised the tea.
N. ,S. Wales and Victorian bowlers had a shivoo
in the Wintergarden Cafe. Mrs. B. Brown, spouse of
the acting-president, hostessed the party, and music
and dancing and supper were on the menu.
Colored . jiankies were like petals of bright flowers
on the heads of the schoolgirls at the inter-Sclioo)
sports the other day, when Grammar, St. Hilda’s, the
High School, the 1.G.G.5., 8.5.H.5., and the Church
of England. High mingled their war cries. The
committee tea-ed the Governor and party, which
included the Wearnes, the Georges, the Stephens, Mrs.
Ernest Baynes and Kathleen Lilley. Sweetpeas and
the woven colors of the different schools decorated the
tables. Among those who came to applaud the
athletic girl were Freda Bage, Dr. Jean White-Haney,
the Scott-Fletcliers, the Owen Cowlishaws and the
Brock'ways.
The Old Girls of Brisbane High School are out to
equip the new science room, and with this in view
they had a concert ill the school hall. Billie Black
conducted a jazz band of 14 members, in black-and-
white Pierrette frocks, All the performers sipped tea
in the headmistress’s studio afterwards.
For Dorotha Spinney, who brings ancient Green"
to us .presently, Mrs, J. 11. Fairfax spread a lunch
at Toojwoomba, amid silver bowls of golden poppies.
Southport, run by the Anglican Church, is the
one secondary school an Queensland that has adopted
old English school-traditions entirely and strives to
live up to them assiduously. Here a sporting
champion possesses so many blazers of so many hues
that if he wore them all at once ho would scare
all the cows away. • The school was established in
1901, a lease being obtained of the old Government
House and grounds, which after three years were
purchased. The old building has lately proved in-
adequate, and a new one is now being erected at
a cost'of £-10,000. Begun last February, the founda-
tion stone was laid by the Governor-General during
Exhibition Week, and the building should be finished
by June. ,
Closer settlement has claimed another slice of
Queensland. This time it is the historic old
Bellevue Hill station; which spreads over 7304 acres
of choice dairying domain. Here the Lumley Hills
of other days dined and wined the Bluebloods of
early Bananaland at the famous Esk home. The
choice morsel has been sliced into the Devil’s number
of selections, but the home itself will remain in
the glory box of the Lumley Hills, the keeper of
the key being Mrs. 1?. J. Watt.

From the Cradle
Onward
melody sings in every human heart. Indeed it is one of
life’s most inspiring heritages.
Perhaps the first lullaby that is sung to the babe in arms
is accomplished by a Player Piano. Grandmother sits
in the twilight and sings the cradle songs of the long ago
—or she may play a melody which the classic masters
wrote long ago —or maybe some old plantation melody.
It is good that the Player Piano has brought the gift of
music to so many.
In the Home in which there is a Player Piano there is the
“Gift to play music’’ to all.

The horn of the hunter called the members
of Victoria’s four hunt clubs—Melbourne,
Findon, Yarra Glen and Lilydale, and Oak-
lands—to the annual dinner meet at Men-
ses’ on Saturday night. For the first time
in the history of the function the gladsome
hail was directed towards the fair followers
of the hounds, and the pink dress-coats of the
hunters mingled charmingly with the cover-
ings of the huntresses. The feasting, which
concluded with a dance, was whipped up
by R. M. Cuthbertson, deputy-master of the
b indon Harriers, and Norman Wood, of
the Melbourne H. C. Two popular R.C.
clerics, known to the hunting world as F.
Ballan and F. Mentone, cliaplained the
gathering, content “to ride to the Golden
B a to.” Barrow, deputy-master of the
Melbourne Club, R. M. Cuthbertson and
A. \ . Hiskens, sec. of the Moonee Valley
R. C., extended the hand of greeting to the
guests,, who fed between hedges of daffodils,
wattle and boronia; and crimson carnations
framed the special visitors at a top cross-
takJe* “A sport that lives by the grace of
God and the help of landowners,” was Major-
General Johnstone’s offering as a toast to the
folk whose property is the cockpit of the
hunters, and was gallantly replied to by
B. U. Tuttle. The devotees included Mrs.
Creswick, in a flame-liued gown; Mrs. A. E.
Syme and Mrs. Norman Wood, in glistening
black ; and Mrs. Reggie Power, whose black
had lines of shiny bugle beads. A crimson
rose nestled on the shoulder of Mrs. H. T.
Barrow’s black georgette frock * Miss Barrow
had bordering of fur upon rose brocade and
georgette; Mrs. A. V. Hiskens wore crystal
embroidery upon lilac-hued draperies; Miss
Barbara Madden was in mauve brocade, and
sister Allison danced in white pleated georg-
ette touched up with silver. Dame Nellie
Melba’s brother, Charlie Mitchell, was accom-
panied by his wife in silver and black
brocade; Mrs. Clive Leonard in a black-
beaded robe was with her V.A.T.C. husband;
Brigadier-General Lloyd (Sydney) ; the
Harold Newbigins and daughter Joan; the
C. C. Lofts and Lieut.-Col. and Mrs. E. N.
Waters were also sighted.
To match the trees that are putting on,
almost over-night, their new Spring gar-
ment, shop-windows are blooming with rags
more wonderful than ever, at prices that
raise an earthquake under new resolutions
of economy. Endeavors to unearth the long-
buried parasol are afoot, but la, la! the new
parachute that will shortly grace the lawns
of Flemington is an airy thing of gathered
chiffon embroidered within and without with
glistening beads —it is as pricey as the Paris
model gown it should accompany.
St. Ivilda Town Hall hoisted red, white
and blue banners with rifles, Light Horse
pennons and bunting for a jazz campaign
directed by the naval, military and air forces.
Crimson mess-jackets led in the engagement,
the Navy gold braid and the pale-blue attach-
ments of the A.F. showing in smaller num-
bers. Major Tackaberry hon. secretaried
the event, guests of honor being St. Kilda’s
new Mayor, George Cummings, and Mrs.
Cummings, whose robing was black, and Sec-
retary of Defence T. Trumble, whose lady
displayed gold and blue embroidery upon
black. Of the one-steppers among the blue-
water folk were Captain and Mrs. Feakes
and Commander and Mrs. A. Stokes. The
land forces were led by Major-General G. J.
Johnstone; Major-General Tivey, whose bat-
talion was Tivey’s “Chocs” in the war-days;
Brigadier-General Smith, whose life-partner
glistened in bugle beads upon black sheath-
ing; president of the U.S. Institute Colonel
Ralph and Mrs. Ralph, in a scintillating
black gown; Colonel Pestell and daughter
Meg; Mrs. Tackaberry, in royal blue satin;
Mrs. Farr, in silver and blue, accompanied
by her Colonel; Lieutenant-Colonel Lorenzo,
with Mrs. Lorenzo; and Mrs. Cate, in silver
lace upon jade green, and her popular Major.
Mrs. T. White, Alfred Deakin’s youngest
daughter, was a good-looker in sparkling
petunia pink—her Colonel hubby was also
of the dancers. The Air Force sent a, group
-—Captain and Mrs. R. Williams and
Squadron-Leader Wrigley and his wife. A
charming member of the younger unattached
was Beatrice Fischer, having a preliminary
canter prior to her own coming-out party
this week; cyclamen feather fringed her
frock of powder-blue. Ivah Perry, another
smart lass, wore white with a painted border
of violets on a background of sunrays.
There is an Australian woman’s hand in
the Mont St. Quentin memorial which was
unveiled by General Foeh a few days ago
on the anniversary of the astounding mili-
tary performance: it was May Butler George
who made the two bas-relief plaques which
depict incidents of the assault. The little
lady is going across to Sydney in a couple
of weeks’ time, and will show at Horderns’
Gallery some of her work, including a replica
of these plaques. She hopes to leave for
Europe soon.
Ernest Rutherford was supposed to be
having a spell from the pursuit of the elusive
atom, but no sooner had he landed at
Spencer-street the other day than he was
seized upon by brother experimenters in the
infinitely small, and feasted, feted and
invited to talk about his pets. He had to
put the blue pencil through much of the
proffered entertainment, and there was femi-
nine heartburning at the Lyceum Club,
which had offered tea. The Victoria League,
Royal Colonial Institute and Royal Society
of Victoria joined forces at the Windsor,
Lady Stradbroke, as president of the Vic-
toria and chairlady, calling on her Lord to
say the welcoming words. Littleton Groom.
James Barrett and one or two others sang
the chorus, and after the scientist had made
a few remarks the distinguished crush pro
ceeded to atomise the cake. John Grice
and his lady collected some guests to meet
Hie visitor at supper after his lecture on
Tuesday night. Governor and Lady Strad
broke and daughter Helena Rous, just back
from England* were of the entertained. The
hostess wore gowning of black, jet-beaded ;
and Elsa Grice was in cyclamen-hue and
gold.
Certain of Mr. Clapp’s railway porters,
without a due sense of the dignity of their
calling, have been falling into lax sartorial
habits. It is hard to believe that any porter,
however youthful, could have so little re-
gard for the high office of lugg'age-carrying
and tip-taking as to wear jazz socks of divers
colors. Yet so it is. There is a still more
lurking danger in the matter of ties. There
is, for example, the red badge of Bolshevism,
the spotted tie of sport, the lavender badge of
matrimony, and so on—quite a lot of signi-
ficance in a tie, its color and even its knot r
Someone—probably one of Mrs. Grundy’s
daughters, who would, of course, find some
sort of psycho-analytical symbolism in
striped socks—made complaint to the Com-
missioners; and now the porters have been
carpeted and told to mend their manners,
change their socks and keep their ties to the
mournful hue of black.
Farewells are thickening round Dr. Geor-
gina Sweet, who has packed her trunks for
a long holiday
in “the East.”
The popular
medico lately
gave £lOOO to-
wards two
scholarships of
£5OO each for
research in bio-
logy open to
women gradu-
ates of the
British Em-
pire, except
Australia and
M.L. Success-
ful applicants
have to come
across the
Pacific to
either Aussie
or Maoriland
to carry on
their research
work here. Dr.
Sweet is the first Australian woman to be
an acting-professor at the Melbourne Uni.,
where she is lecturer and demonstrator in
biology and others matters. She has written
many scientific papers upon her pet subject,
in which she carried off during her student
days many coveted prizes.
Priminister Bruce’s wife, in a gown of
black topped by lime-hued straw millinery
adorned with gold grapes, said the opening
wishes at the Arts and Crafts Society’s
Exhibition at the Town Hall. President
J. R. Tranthim Fryer, director of the Swin-
burne Technical School, whose fine contri-
bution adds weightily to the show, introduced
the visitor. The entries had been well
censored, so a high standard was revealed
in china-painting, pottery, metal work, book-
binding and stitchery. There are etchings,
bookplates and woodcuts, with sketch-
portraits by Mrs. Gayer Phipps, an artist
equally happy with her needle. The
Soldiers’ Red Cross handicrafts sec-
tion demonstrates once more with won-
derful raffia and straw baskets the
adaptability of the Digger. Mrs. H. C.
Walker illustrates the utility of stringy-bark
in a stall stocked with quite beautiful mats
and baskets. Mrs. Lane Poole, whose hus-
band is of the Federal Forestry Department,
learnt decorating and designing in Ireland
from Lily Yeats, a sister of the Irish poet.
She also spurs the home-furniture maker to
action with a suite of Aussie blackwood and
maple stained to rosewood hue. A fire-screen
in fine silk embroidery is the work of her
teacher, who has become a member of the
Vie. Arts and Crafts, and sends along many
samples of needlework from the Cuala
School, proving that the trials of Govern-
ment in the ould sod have not killed those
arts in which she once led the world. But
this Chatterer could fill the page in tribute
to the clever fingers whose fashionings have
made this bazaar of splendid simple things
the best yet. Secretary Mrs. Stewart Mur-
ray is to be congratulated upon the generally
excellent arrangements.
Miss Alice Currie, one of Victoria’s brush-
women, confronts you here. With her sister
Edith, whose
forte is land-
scape in water-
color, she has
held several
shows, her
own line being
church in-
teriors and
arc hitectural
work- At pre-
sent she is
demonstrating,
through the
Arts and
Crafts’ Exhi-
bition, how to
make side-
boards and
rocking-chairs
out of petrol
tins and cases
in the new
settlers’ living-
l'oom which
she arid Mrs. Walker have arranged. Miss
Currie is very well known in N. S. Wales
as the originator of the scheme in 1913 for
bringing women and children from the Back-
blocks to properly-organised seaside camps.
(i matinees at the King’s Theatre of
“So This Is Elegance,” presented by Berlei,
Ltd., have filled feminine hearts with hope.
From beneath gorgeously embroidered shawls
trappings for all figures budded; and lovely
evening gowns in an Oriental setting were cast
aside to show the supports responsible for such
perfection of straight line. Quite the most
artistic effort was the Wedgwood group; white
satin Berlettes covered the powdered-haired
demonstrators—covered them, anyhow, al-
most from neck to knee—against a blue-grey
background. Additional attractions were a
number of ballets which indulged in Greek
and eurhythmic movements. Mary Craven,
in the smartest of black satin wrappings
and pleated ivory georgette, supplied the
little talk that the occasion called for.
Hanna’s Diggers’ show at the Athenseum
has an attractively youthful ballet with
shapely limbs and nimble feet. Exceedingly
pretty covering and a fine color scheme are
exhibited in “A Garden Idyll,” in which the
lassies wear pastel frocks of radium lace
with hip extensions of pink roses. Their
flared upholstery of black taffeta with a red
rose perched on one shoulder provides an
animated background to Iza Crossley’s gown
of crimson satin and the Spanish shawl in
which she sings of the land of Mafiana.
Robert Best and his lady, with lots of
interested friends, were in the crush on
Saturday night at the King’s to see daugh-
ter Phyllis play Balthazar in the Moscovitch
revival of “The Merchant.” The lass, look-
ing charming, received much floral reward.
President of the Women’s Automobile
Club Mrs. H. J. Robertson joined with Mrs.
J. W. Springthorpe in an entertaining at
tlie .W.A.C. rooms the other night. Dr.
Springthorpe cranked up the thoughts of the
gathering to a serious contemplation of the
future. Young Australia wasn’t getting a
fair deal, he said. Our education system
was all wrong, the Government did little
and did it wrong, girls couldn’t cook, and all
was black. Then thoughts were turned to
lighter vein by the vocal contributions of
Mrs. Robertson, Miss Muriel Cheek and
Mrs. George Haines, with recitations by
Bertha Collin.
Nest Malcolm used tea and cake at the
Wattle to introduce Mrs. Thomas Tabart
and her daughters Pixie and Edna to some
Melbourne folk. Mrs. Malcolm, in ensemble
suit of black fancy Ottoman silk, with
touches of petunia pink and black millinery,
joined hands with the hostess. Mrs. Tabart,
who is the wife of the new secretary of the
V.A.T.C., lately arrived from Appleland,
wore a frock of nigger-brown with millinery
in tune. Miss Malcolm’s wide-leafed ecru
straw hat was rose-trimmed, and worn with
knitted silk covering in amber and dull green
tones. Mrs. Tabart’s chicks will be on the
roll of St. Catherine’s Girls’ School when
the new term opens.
Christ Church, South Yarra, housed the
wedding of Beryl Admans and barrister
Arthur Clifford Hart. The bride, who wore
a gown of silver tissue softened by crystal
and pink beaded lace, is the younger daugh-
ter of Mr. and Mrs. W. Admans, of Bruns-
wick. Three bridesmaids, led by sister Dr.
Alma, carried the ’groom’s gifts of silver
and blue theatre-bags to harmonise with
similar-hued frocking and coiffure adorn-
ment. The happy man is a son of
Major and Mrs. A. G. C. Hart, also of
Brunswick. Mrs. Admans, in black Chan-
tilly lace and gold tissue, hostessed the after-
spree at No. 9 Darling-street.
Musical folk are going to help pianist
Dorothea Macmaster to go abroad for a
couple of years to further her knowledge.
She is a diploma student of the University
Con., and both as teacher and soloist has
proved herself to be well endowed. Her
father, the late Milner Macmaster, was on
the staff of one of Melbourne’s dailies for
some years.
Merric Boyd has just had a successful show
of his dull and glazed wares at the Mel-
bourne Book Club. He is a brother of late
artist Penleigh, and is doing much to get
Australian pottery recognised. In his de-
signs our native trees and flowers are treated
in very happy fashion.
Students of the Uni. Conservatorium of
Music presented programmes on two nights
last week at the Assembly Hall. The sing-
ing was decidedly weak, but quite promising
work was done by the pianoforte students,
Goll’s pupils generally showing traces of
their master in their interpretations. A
youthful player of considerable ability ap-
peared in Morfyn Jones, who is under Mr.
Homeward; but Isobel Carter carried off the
honors for Mr. Goll on the first evening.
Of the numerous accompanists Marjorie
Stahmer displayed the most consideration
for the soloists, and Helen Hamerton car-
ried the banner of violinist Bernard Ileinze
with credit.
Miss Billinghurst, in frocking of black
satin and lace, with headpiece of velvet in
apricQt hue, engineered a card-party at the
Austral Salon last week. Between the scores
Clare Davies warbled, and Hamilton Bate-
man was heard in violin solos to the accom-
paniments of Harold Itodgers.
Constance Neville-Johns, a Conservatorium
student, is singing her way into the profes-
sional world of the U.S.A. and Canada. The
song-bird went over there under engagement
to the Chautauqua Association, and has
made good. One critic even likens her liquid
notes to those of Galli-Curci.
Miss Adelaide’s postscript:—
For women, and especially those of them who
love committees, it has been a violent week. Every
association that could manage it staged an annual
or a special meeting, with the result that Lady
Forster has worked overtime; and almost everywhere
the vice-reine spoke she had something new and
stimulating to say. To Bed Cross members, to whom
Lord Forster also said a word before going on to an
informal meeting of Toe. H., the burden of her
speech wgs the value of Junior Red Cross work, and
a meeting is to be called to launch the movement
here. The Victoria League tea was almost the
only place where she did not speak, and there the
G.-G. replied delightfully for both of them to T.
E. Barr Smith’s good-bye. The said tea was in
the Exhibition Building, its dingy gloom relieved
by long lines of tables glowing with Iceland poppies
and violets, and its stage—whence Clive Carey sang
with his accustomed skill—banked high with gum
branches and spring flowers.
For the farewelling G.-G.’s there have been,
besides a reception at Government House, a mayoral
good-bye at the Town Hall (the latter on the
afternoon that winter decided to return and drove us
back to furs) ; also an orchestral concert, and a
luncheon at the Commonwealth Club. The concert
was arranged in response to an intimation that the
Forsters would like to hear the State Orchestra, and
an excellent account it gave of itself, with Tsehai-
kowsky’s “Symphonie Pathetique” the big item of the
evening.
Government House is temporarily in use again
(the Federal Excellencies stayed there as the Pooles’
guests), and the other night every corner blossomed
into flowers—branches of camellias and peach
blossom and golden-tongued arums, with the massed
fragrance of sweet-peas and the glow of Iceland
poppies. Guests were chiefly official and the not-
so-young, and dressing mostly sombre or shimmering
crystal and sequin. Lady Forster was in blue and
geld with a hint of crystal; Mrs. Poole in befurred
brocaded tissue, and her daughter in white with
a flare of orange at side and hem.
The mayoral entertainment —an afternoon one —
was in the Town Hall, fragrant with the first of the
spring roses and a-bloek with guests. There were
speeches and there was tea, and the whole affair was
cheery—like all the Glovers’ entertainments.
Few committees have given a better account of
themselves than the women’s auxiliary that set out
to enable Helene Taylor to go on with her studies
in London and abroad. Their final balance-sheet
shows takings of £4OO with only £25 against them
for expenses. The singer in future is to be Helene
Adelia; her committee’s benediction has been given
to the new name.
Thanks to the shipping muddle there’ll be one
important guest absent from the Lendon-Burston
wedding. Dorothy Lendon, bound homewards from
London in time to wish her brother luck, is doing
some compulsory sight-seeing in South Africa witli
the rest of the Nestor’s passengers.
Miss Blanche Amand Wright has just passed over*
She was one of the founders of the Alliance Fran-
chise, and sowed some of the early seeds of our
culture by originating home-reading circles tfor
younger femininity.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Tatt.’s Club set the ball rolling at Sydney
headquarters on Saturday when the seven-furlongs
Tramway Handicap brought out a baker’s dozen of
Epsom horses, albeit several were only out for an airing.
Those who had anticipated the stable commission for
the big race on Irish Prince have every reason for
satisfaction; starting at 11 to 2, he won well,
though the verdict was only a neck, from Baldwin
(14 to 1). His success has already made him a
strong fancy for the Epsom, but it has to be re-
membered that he will meet Boaster on 181 b. worse
terms. Boaster was set to give Irish Prince 281 b.
on Saturday, and looked like doing it until the
weight began to tell at the turn —the race was run
in record time for Australia. None of the others
come down in the weights as much as Boaster, and
his form looked good enough to keep him in his
position as favorite. It was significant that the
Chosen refrained from taking any liberties with
Blackadder, even after his unplaced effort. The form
of The Welkin horse was obviously too bad to be
true, especially considering his showing with Honan
and Valamita at Rosehill and the way in which those
two horses proved themselves during the afternoon
in their respective races. Newmarket winner, Valiard,
again failed to shine as a weight carrier, and he
will only drop 41b. to help him over the extra
furlong. Baldwin, so narrowly defeated, was accounted
unlucky bv his connections, but the son of Seaton’s
Melbourne Cup winner is capable of a lot of im-
provement in the three weeks before the big race.
His. effort —better than a dozen gallops—plus the
attentions of trainer George Price, would neutralise
the easy time Baldwin had had since he chased
Balbus home in the Villiers last December.
Another race-shy horse to run well was John
Brown’s Sir Alick, who, however, did not have the
best of passages, through his jockey’s propensity for
sticking to the rails. Hit also suffered interference,
and with better luck might have got amongst the
place money.
Windbag’s win (5 to 2 on) in the Chelmsford
Stakes—a foregone conclusion from the time Amounis
was withdrawn—proved instructive in several respects.
It showed the quality of, Virgin Gold, who dead-
heated for third place with Pilliewinkie, a neck behind
Valamita, with the result that MeShortodds promptly
cramped the price of “Pat” Osborne’s imported
horse for the Metropolitan. Windbag was clocked
as running the lafei; half-mile in 49-lsec. —the same
as recorded by Jidmetus over the first half of the
journey—but Virgin Gold’s burst of speed was
more notable even than that. Pilliewinkie was
thought to have a great chance in the Metro-
politan, but Virgin Gold, who gave him a big start
over the last part of the race and caught him on
the post, should bold him safe. Much criticism has
been leVelled at! the owner of Valamita for with-
drawing the Valais horse from the Metropolitan and
making the Caulfield Cup his mission, taking in the
weight-for-age races only in the interim. Valamita
ran a creditable second to Wirtdbag, after almost
falling* as he began* his run in the straight. His
owner is confident that Heroic cannot concede him
161 b. over a mile and a half.
Ever since the last St. Leger, when Windbag beat
Spearfelt—their last actual meeting, as Spearfelt fell
in the Sydney Cup—-opinions 'have differed concerning
their respective merits! Many thought the result of
the Leger a fluke and blamed “Bobby” Lewis for over-
confidence on Spearfelt. A return meeting has been
awaited with interest. There were sinister rumors
on Saturday that it was never likely to eventuate, for
a telegram was received by a bookmaker from Mel-
bourne stating that the Victoria Derby winner had
been fatally injured while en route to Sydney. It
proved a preposterous exaggeration, however ; Spearfelt
had merely missed the train. The Randwick Plate
will be the test between the pair, and the result of
the contest over the two miles should set at rest all
controversy. Afterwards, Spearfelt will go in quest of
the Caulfield Cup.
A further possibility for the Epsom was disclosed
in the 10-furlongs Spring Handicap. This was the
imported Honan (7 to 1), who rushed to the front
soon after the start and showed any amount of
stamina by leading all the way. He did not beat
much, of course. Atholdorus ran second, just in
front of the favorite, Shrapnel (4 to 1), whose
connections looked on the race as a stepping-stone
towards the Melbourne Cup. Metropolitan fancy
Frances Tressady had a run behind Honan, and the
experience will prove useful to her, while Prince
Minimbah need not be condemned too hastily on his
failure, as he was injured in the race.
Only bad luck, or the judge, was responsible, many
believed, for Feathernest not being awarded the last
Metropolitan. That he may make a more successful
bid is suggested by the good form this outsider (20
to 1) showed in Tatt.’s Welter Mile. He has come
into the betting with a rush. Sum King (10 to 1),
with whom he dead-heated, has Derby aspirations and
cannot be faulted for the classic event on the score
of breeding.
* » * *
There were three better favorites than
Moogana (7 to 1) in the £lOOO Moonee Valley
(Vic.) Steeplechase on Saturday, Irish Rufus (12st.
131 b.), who had won the race in 1923 and i 924,
being first choice at 3 to 1. Moogana (lOst. 131 b.)
was always going like a winner; jumping beautifully,
he took the lead about six furlongs from home, and
eventually won in a canter by five lengths from
Welcome Stranger (20’s), with the favorite third.
The winner is likely to turn out a very useful ’chaser.
He was ridden by R. Connelly. The star perform-
ance of the afternoon was Manacre’s in carrying lOst.
51b. to easy victory in the six-furlongs Coo-ee
Handicap for three-year-olds. King of Oude was
second and Supremacy third. Manaere missed the
jump out and was a long way back at one time, but
he ran past the field at the turn and from then on
it was all over. The Maribyrnong Plate winner has
retained all his two-year-old pace. He has 7st. 61b.
in the Caulfield Cup and 7st. 41b. in the Melbourne.
Textile (7 to 1), 7st. 81b., who has disappointed
many times recently, easily took the mile and a
quarter Budgeree Handicap from a hot favorite in
Batteryman (7 to 4), with Noscitur (7 to 1) third.
The winner lias 7st. 91b. in both Caulfield and Mel-
bourne Cups and has been supported for the former
event. He won convincingly on Saturday, but the
opposition was very ordinary. Palelight, nicely
handled by Zeally, was first past the post in the
Corroboree Handicap, with Drina second and that
good horse Mercian King third. The King looked
rather burly but gave a good display, and is sure to
be prominent a little later. Waranton finished a bad
day for backers —only one favorite was successful —-
by easily taking the six-furlong Welter from Trillo.
and Nillumbik.

“R.M.”: An interesting relic has turned
up at Adelaide in what is thought to be the first
cup presented for a horserace in South Aus. This
was the Wheatsheaf Cup, run at Morphett Vale
in 1845. The winner was offered his choice of £25
or a trophy, and to the surprise of the judges, who
apparently had not thought it worth while to pro-
vide a cup, chose the latter. An order had to be
sent to England, and it was not until two years
after the race tnat the winner was presented with
his trophy.
HUGH TROUBLE, secretary of the M.C.C.,
and a great howler in his day.
“H. Hardupp”: Young Harold Hewitt, the
midget Tasmanian, now with Vin O’Neill, at Caul-
field, is claimed to be Australia’s lightest jockey.
If required to do so, he could ride at sst„ yet he
has a cool head and a capital pair of hands. The
tiny 15-year-old has been promised some good mounts
at the big meetings.
Saturday’s League games in Melbourne
were unattractive spectacles, but their consequences
were momentous. Geelong stayed at the top of the
ladder by scoring 100 points to ’Scray’s 61 ; Essen-
don continued in second place by outing St. Hilda
with 67 points to 68 ; and Melbourne, which had a
somewhat slack grip on the third position, found
the Tigers without any bite or even, a scratch, and
polished them off casually, getting 63 points to
Richmond's 24. The achievements of the day were
carried out at South Melbourne, where the Magpies
galloped over the Red-and-Whites with 96 points to
30, and at FitZroy, where the Maroons just squeezed
home from Carlton, with 66 points to 64. When
the games Started, ’Roy, through its defeat of 'Wood
the previous week, was level with the Magpies, but
had a somewhat better percentage of points scored.
To displace 'Roy, the Magpies had to score 10
goals more than South, while 'Roy’s percentage re-
mained stationary or nearly so. Few thought it
could be done, but it was. Not only did 'Wood get
all the points it wanted, but the 'Roy forwards en-
thusiastically secured their team’s downfall by boot-
ing 7 goals 24 behinds for their afternoon’s work!
It wasn’t healthy to refer to that feat in Fitzroy
that evening. After displacing ’Wood in a hard
game, to go and let those same Magpies push them
out of “the four’’ was the limit.
* * * *
“G. 0.8.”: Football fans whose main
object in life is to scream their teams into the
final four are now r dividing their sympathy between
Geelong and Melbourne, which, after years of adver-
sity, have a chance of flying this season’s pennant.
In the early days of the game these two clubs
were always strong. Melbourne, the first team to
play the Aussie game in the ’fifties, won the first
competition when the Association started in 1870,
and for nine years were either first or second.
Since their premiership in 1876, however, they have
only hit the top once, in 1900. Each season they
commence like champions and finish like cab-horses.
This year the customary collapse came, but they
just managed to keep in the four, and as the finals
are on their own ground they have already picked
the flagpole. Geelong’s great period was from ’7B
to ’B6. In those years they carried off the premier-
ship seven times, but they have not managed it once
since. Always formidable on their own ground,
they were generally easy money in the city after
their long train journey. This year, however, they
have been as successful abroad as at home, and with
the double chance as minor premiers they should
carry the pennant—the first for 40 years—to the
Pivot.
* * * *
. By defeating a strong Poverty Bay XV
by 11 to 3 on Saturday, the N.S.W. Rugby Union
tourists scored their sixth victory in seven matches.
Canterbury is the only team so far that has had the
upper hand of them (22 —13). The visitors’ aggre-
gate points are 149 against 87. The successes are
putting Dominion ’bailers on their mettle, and most of
the All Black team which went through the U.K. like
a scythe through daisies will be requisitioned for the
first Test. But the Ma Staters have youth on their
side and “Tommy” Lawton behind the pack, and
they refuse to feel downhearted.
* * * *
Queensland Rugby Leaguers smashed Maori-
land in the second Test at Auckland on Saturday,
and the board showed 36 points to 14 in their favor
when the barrackers ceased to inflate their lungs. The
Reds led 10 to 7 at half-time; later, the poor defence
of the M.L. backs gave their opponents a picnic.
Jimmy Craig helped the side by landing seven goals
(14 points) ; the try-scorers were Crouch (2), Ayns-
ley (2), Steinhart and Purcell. Kirwan (2 tries) and
Delgrosso (four goals) got all the M.L. points).
* * * *
Tom Vines, wito in 1912 established the
record time of 58min. 3sec. in the ten miles cross-
country championship, ran again in the event at
Caulfield on Saturday, finishing loth; he saw his
old record smashed by the five-mile champion, G.
Hyde, who covered the distance in 57min. 601 sec.,
finishing freshly, 80 yards ahead of his clubmate,
N. Chiverton (Melb.), who was a furlong in front of
the pride of St. Stephen’s, J. E. Bell. Last year’s
champion, F. Kohlman, could do no better than sixth.
Hyde’s performances suggest he has the makings of
an Olympic champion in him. Although the Mel-
bourne Club runners got first and second places,
St. Stephen’s, whose six runners all finished amongst
the first 18, won the teams championship easily.
* * * *
The fine victory of Randel Rose in the
Australasian cross-country championship at Welling-
ton has induced the M.L. Amateur Athletic Associa-
tion to extend an invitation to Paavo Nurmi, the
record-breaking Finn, to come and give an exhi-
bition of his prowess in this country. Nurmi is
such a phenomenal runner that, even were there no
one to extend him, his appearance on the tracks
would give foot-running a tremendous boom. Rose
waded through 10,000 metres of mud at Hutt Park
in 36min. llsec., and won with lmin. 39sec. to
spare; and he has been doing similar things for
many years. J. H. Tapp (M.L.), W. M. Whyte (Vic.),
and M. J. Mackenzie and C. Weeks (N.S.W.) are
the most promising of the other distance peds.
seen out this year.
* * * *
M. J. Mackenzie (Cumberland), who filled
third place in the N.S.W. cross-country championship
at Sydney and finished ninth in the Australasian event
at Wellington (M.L.), left the field toiling in the
rear in the Manly Modified Marathon (12 miles) at
Sydney on Saturday. Alan Gainsford (St. George)
was 46sec. behind the winner, with A. Bateman
(South Sydney), a prominent, young athlete, third.
The alternation of hard road and sand strung out the
plodders like Brown’s cows. An interested looker-on
was H. Hayden, who won the event in 1913. 1919,
1920, 1923 and 1924 ; but for an injured leg his
tally of successes would have been even longer.
•* •* * *
“B.”: By taking 200 wickets in English
cricket this season., E. A. Macdonald joins another
ex-Australian player, Albert Trott, who took 239
wickets in 1899 and 211 in 1900. With Australian
Xl’s in England, Charlie Turner got 314 and Jack
Ferris 220 in 1888; F. Spofforth, 216 in 1884;
Turner and Ferris 215 apiece in 1890.
-***•*
There is not a cricket-lover in Australia
or out of it but will feel keen pleasure at the
evidence C. G. Macartne3 r gave last Saturday that
he has returned to health and form. The Common-
wealth’s finest and most attractive batsman of a few
seasons back has not been seen at the creases since
a breakdown in health caused him to retire before
the last Test series against Gilligan’s team began ; he
emerged from retirement last Saturday to take the
field for T. Andrews’ XI against a team of Bexley
colts at Sydney, and in 58min. collected 108 runs,
including three sixers and 16 tourers. Johnny Taylor
(63) and Alan Kippax (51) were also busy. Among
the juniors. W. Grace (35) and W. Barle (28) showed
well. It was a match in aid of the St. George District
Ambulance, and the batting was exhilarating enough
throughout to make one wish there were more matches
for benevolent purposes.
* * * «
“M.H.”: As usual, there will be some
chopping and changing in Sydney premiership cricket
this season. Jack Gregory shifts from Manly to
the amalgamated Sydney-Paddington; W. Trennery
goes to Mosman ; J. Mathers, of last year’s Victorian
Second XI, will play with Gordon; and rep. wicket-
keeper Andy Ratcliffe crosses to Glebe. The last club
has had many a State and international player to
help it, Oldfield being
the last. In many
clubs a serious effort
will be made this year
to bring out promis-
ing juniors. It rests
with the selectors
whether the best of the
colts get a place in the
matches v. Queensland
and Maoriland. With
Collins, Mailey and
Oldfield as selectors,
the younger talent
should be able to rely
on a fair spin.

“A lamb for the sacrifice” was the role
of Bobbie Gray (Bst. 81b.) at Sydney Stadium on Satur-
day night. The recent arrival from Manila, Ignacio
Fernandez (Bst. 7fib.), did the butchering, and it
took the coffee-colored gladiator less than a third
of a round to do it. Gray was counted out and the
referee was out of the ring in, just 68 seconds!
There was no scare about it, either. Bobbie was
game enough and led off with a good pair of wallops
to the slats; but the cat-like Filipino ignored them,
and, jabbing the Caucasian’s nose with the left, he
slammed a downward right to the chin and Bob
went quite peacefully to sleep. Ignacio is a mere
slip of a brown boy, but it looks as though it will
require somebody like Bill Grime to stop liis gallop.
Two fights and two wins, in less than six rounds
all told, is_ pretty fair going! But he is not likely
to meet Grime till he’s earned a lot more easy money.
The crowd which filled Melbourne Stadium
on Saturday made lawyer Jimmy O’Connell its
favorite, possibly because it has grown tired of seeing
Walter Miller on top, but Walter showed undeniable
superiority in the best display of fast and willing
wrestling that has been staged. Again and again he
evaded O’Connell’s most dangerous holds and treated
his opponent to variations of his own. There was no
lack of vigor or cleverness in the Yankee’s efforts, and
the crowd sizzled with excitement for three rounds.
Then it surged to its feet with a roar ; Miller, twist-
ing on the mat, had clamped his legs round
O’Connell’s head, and, exercising irresistible pressure,
gradually pushed down his opponent’s shoulders.
O’Connell sailed in with grim determination to
equalise, but Miller was too strong and resourceful;
again in the sixth round he straddled, put a figure
four hold on, and, with side face bar, substituted for
reverse in chancery, again pinned down his struggling
challenger. The crowd was disappointed at the
result and showed it by failing to give Miller the
applause he deserved. But there was nothing dis-
appointing in the quality of the entertainment.

The outstanding figure of the Victorian
amateur wrestling and boxing championships, which
have been drawing moderate attendances to Wirths’
Olympia, has been the Esthonian wrestler Anton
Koolman, who represented his country at the Olympic
Games. Born in the same town as Sam Burweister,
and possessing the prestige of having wrestled with
Karasick and Limutkin, he was obviously a cut
above the other competitors; but last year’s middle-
weight champion, T. P. Bolger, put up a good bout
against his formidable opponent. Koolman, who
weighed in at 10 stone at the outset and had gone
through undefeated to the finals when this par. was
written, may by this time have achieved his ambi-
tion of scoring the Treble —light, welter and middle-
weight championships. Several boys amongst the
contestants have shown good form. A 14-year-old
wrestler, G. Donnett, did well in the bantam division ;
and in the boxing J. Lake scored in the welter
division, and the 16-year-old W. Yynch, who stripped
at the substantial weight of list. 71b., put up in
the heavyweights a rattling good fight with 0. Moses
(a Melbourne Rugby enthusiast who is a forward in
the St. Kilda team) before being outpointed by an
opponent to whom he gave 291 b.

The Davis Cup remains in possession of
Uncle Sam of the waving goatee; one may picture
it wagging more triumphantly than ever when the
U.S. players defeated France in the challenge round
by five games to none. Yet in both of the singles
against the ultra-formidable Tilden—who has the
distinction of not having lost a singles match in six
years of Davis Cup play—the challengers put up an
extraordinarily good fight; in fact there was a stage
in each contest when the Frenchmen seemed almost
assured of victory. Tilden beat Borotra after a
gruelling struggle, in which he owed his ultimate
success only to superior generalship and perhaps more
dogged endurance, by 4 —6, 6—o, 2—6, 9 —7, 6 —4.
He beat Lacoste- —after the latter had won the first
two sets and been at match point four times in the
third—by 3—6, 10—12, B—6, 7—6, 6—2. On the
other hand, Johnson accounted for both of the French-
men without much difficulty, with 6 —l, 6 —l, 6—-8
and 6—3 against Lacoste, and 6—l, 6—4, 6—o
against Borotra. In the doubles Richards and
Williams outplayed the overworked French pair, each
of them showing the effects of the preceding day’s
hard hammering, by 6—4, 6—4, 6—3. Perhaps the
most striking feature of the five matches was Tilden’s
splendid recovery and his ultimate wearing down of
his antagonists when hope must have almost seemed
lost, although the result of those two contests could
hardly have affected the issue in view of the superi-
ority shown by Johnson and the American doubles
pair. There will be some changes in the experts’
grading of the world’s best tennis players in
the light of this year’s Davis Cup matches. Borotra
will certainly go up a few places; so will Patterson.

“The doctor told me to get interested in some
kind of sport so that I would forget the 'vVaf, and

bankruptcy suit.
To Jaeko Turk he talked upon a day
With epithets a-thund’ring from great guns
That flamed across a quiet, misty bay;
And still o’ nights the tremor through him runs,
When leaden feet drag back through fevered dreams
To that red beach where death a welcome screams.
But with death no more he gambles
Where the bullets whistle shrill;
Quite another sort of shambles
lie has found — it’s murder still —
Where Maclsaacs slaughters odds up on the
Hill.
Though Fritz he met in many a swinish mood,
When Flanders mud in all its loathsomeness
Seemed stainless-sweet by contrast with the brood
Of men that walked it, beasts in dull distress;
Though dreader scenes of carnage he recalled
In memories that blistered and appalled—
There was little less disaster,
Almost just as big a kill,
When he lost his last piastre
In that thrice terrific mill,
Where Mac. massacred the odds up on the
Hill.
All through the stricken years he helped to reap
The bloody harvest hate and fear had sown,
When lucky counted he who yet might keep
Life flickering and reason on her throne;
And now, in later efforts to forget,
New frightfulness he finds, more frightful yet.
While the dictum old of Sherman
He endorses with a will;
Done with Turkish hell or German,
Death lies thick about him still,
Where Maclsaacs murders odds up on the
Hill,
VICTORIA.

THE INKY WAY.
“Childers”: The linotype’s fancy seems to wander
when it has a “House for Sale” ad. to set. In
Adelaide a “six-roomed mouse” was lately offered for
inspection; then “a charming residence surrounded by
large guns”; and now a “tripe-fronted house.”
This last has me beaten—unless the intelligent
machine hoped to captivate some retired butcher
with a novel scheme of decoration.
The Evening News (Sydney), which is 58,
was the first evening paper printed in Australia.
Originally published at the Empire office in Hunter-
street, later on it set up a plant of its own in
Tilt-street, next shifted to Market-street, and is now
building in Elizabetli-street. Melbourne’s first evening'
paper was published in 1869 by David Syme of the
Age. Acquiring the Herald from Levey, Syme con-
verted the paper into an evening sheet, installing
Graham Berry as editor.
“Davos”: “Simon” makes reference to the youth of
the Shakespeare brothers of the Hawkesbury Herald.
There was at least one Australian editor of fewer
years. At 20 David Harrison established and edited the
Tenterfield News a year ago. Last month he laid
his pen aside to join the staff of a Sydney importing
firm. Journalism gripped him only 16 months ago,
when he enlisted on the Guardian and later marched
to the Lismore Star. Naturally he is proud of the
title credited to him—“ Australia’s youngest editor.”
“Curlew”: My experience as a freelance is much
the same as “Hamer’s” and “Gan’s.” The worst
treatment I’ve had was from a paper in Perth, which
held my story of 6000 words for nearly seven years
and then paid me £2 10s. In 1896 I handed some
verses to the editor of a well-known Sydney weekly
when I was on my way to Coolgardie, and though
they appeared a few weeks later it was not until
1919 that I knew it, and collected. I made a
promise once not to kill any more editors, but feel
inclined to break it when editors keep my con-
tributions without saying yea or nay, and also retain
the “stamps for return,”
“Topee”: Tile recent death of the relict of “Gus”
Wangenheim, caricaturist and father of singer Emily,
recalls the old Castlereagh-street inn (now the site
of the new Government Savings Bank), of which
he was host, and whose whitewashed walls, covered
with caricatures of his own and customer artists,
were a centre of attraction for Australian Bohemia.
Re-named the Bulletin Hotel about 1882, the place
was taken over by Richmond Thatcher, once well
known in press and theatrical circles. It was in
this house that one of the hundred or so papers that
have been going to “wipe the floor with The Bulle-
tin” was projected,. JJfick Thatcher having for coadju-
tors “The Pilgrim” (Harold Gray) and Victor Daly,
who had temporarily run foul of W. H, Traill. The
paper went to about eight or ten issues. One of the
finest caricatures on the old pub’s walls was of
■iohn McElhone, then, member for the Upper Hunter;
it was by scenic-artist, Clint.
“T.P.”; The Bishop of Gippsland (Dr, Cranswick),
Mary Grant Bruce and B. J. Brady have been
teamed up for ehuroll work, in a manner of speaking.
The Bishop works the mountain fastnesses of Croa-
jingalong with a band of sisters and bush mission-
aries. From Traralgon and from Mallacoota the
literary pair watched the devoted people on their
job of ministering,, specially to women and kiddies
out back. And not, only to women and kiddies; one
sister rode over ' mountain tracks for scores of
miles beside a etufetcher carrying a smashed-up bush-
man to a hospital. That is how the inimitable
Brady has been 'launched into a publicity campaign
for the raising of more funds to carry brightness
into the lives of the pioneers of the Far-baclc. Mean-
, while the authoress has been giving special attention
to her section. It all helps to make the world look
and feel a Bit' brighter.
“Midford”: I don’t think there was a journalist in
Australia with a more intimate first-hand knowledge
of pastoral matters all over the Commonwealth than
W illiam Thorold Grant (“Bendlcby” of the Austral-
asian), who died in Syjdney last week, aged about
64. Grant was Warwickshire-born and educated at
Eton and Christ Churah, Oxford, but he reached
Australia in the middle ’eighties, and since then lie
had accumulated a knowledge of it given to few to
obtain or to write a (put. He was even on the
W.A. ‘goldfields in the j roaring days, and with the
money he made there went back to England and
acquired a pack of foxhounds. But he didn’t remain
many years, probably finding it hardly spacious
enough. As a writer on| stock and station properties
he had made a unique', place for himself, first in
Adelaide and then in Melbourne. He travelled widely,
wherever there were sheqp or stations or shows, and
the amount of copy he 1 - turned out was enormous.
Merinos were his strongest suit, and his'knowledge
of the people who own trtem was unsurpassed.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
lie was of them that flowered —
The waratah that towered
Lonely in splendor.
Bloom of a field unfilled
He as no other spilled
All the heart’s tender.
He was a slender mast
Set where life’s seas were vast;
There sorrow drew him
And shipwrecked called him brother—
Him only, not another.
Temptation knew him.
And deep into our eves
He looked and saw what lies
Under their veiling-;
Saw the bright bud of bloom
Wither, as though of doom
A wasted trailing;
Saw the quick look of hope
Fade in a narrow scope,
Cruel as prison;
Heard, in our singing, tears
That through the grinding years
Hied unarisen.
In his heart pity grew
As on the grass the dew
A one see reviling;
And on our hands he laid
His clean lips unafraid—
Love undefilirig.
Then, at his touch, awoke
Tears that in rivers broke,
Tears that in falling
Watered our burnt-out eyes
And writhen lips, whose cries
Mourned in their calling;
Watered each bruised heart.
Where life’s long-wounding smart
Held the deep aching
Of that old, hidden sore
Which, half-unknown, we bore,
To our heart’s breaking;
Watered till tenderness
Flowered of its own distress;
And sudden yearning-
Bade each one, in her place,
Bend o’er a child’s young face
With pity burning.
He was our own, say they,
In their slow, saddened way.
Now he is gone
And none is left to call upon-
Not one to aid us.

On his way back to U.S.A. Guy Bates
Post should pay a call on the Sultan of
Djokja, Java. That amiable monarch if
suitably approached would doubtless stage
a serimpi-dunce for him, and the American
actor would have the privilege of seeing the
apotheosis of his own style of acting. The
serimpi dancers are nine ladies of royal blood
who portray the dramatic story of how a
demon stole the delightful Siti from the arms
of Rama, and they do it somewhat after the
fashion of a slow-motion moving-picture of
a prize tight or a polka. The oscillation of
an elbow or the undulating of a hip at in-
tervals of half an hour or so is the limit of
expression the art allows, and if Mr. Post
has time to stay 11 days and nights he will
be able to see the whole thing through from
overture to final curtain. This stage conven-
tion enthrals Oriental playgoers; but when
presented with Bates Post’s version of it in
"The Nigger” at Sydney Royal on Saturday
the subconscious minds of the white audi-
ence occasionally went jazzing.
* * * *
Besides being presented as a play the piece
was introduced as White Australia propa-
ganda, and a prize was offered for the best
essay on the subject of this country’s immi-
gration policy. A weary critic hungry for
unsophisticated entertainment here inter-
poses an emphatic protest. If the Post enter-
prise succeeds in filling seats we will have
“Othello” and “East of Suez” back again
offering rewards for the best composition on
miscegenation; and “King Bear” revived and

* < * * *
A young southern landowner, in love with
a white girl of ancient lineage, discovers
after he has been elected Governor of his
State through the instrumentality of a
wealthy brewer, that he has a thin sprinkle
of African blood, and when he proposes in
the interests of the niggers to sigu a bill
establishing prohibition in the State, the
brewer threatens to expose him. The Senator
responsible for the dry legislation convinces
the Governor that as a semi-nigger hte
should devote .himself to the uplifting of his
black relations, and the curtain descends on
an act of renunciation performed before the
assembled protelariat off-stage. As the
tainted gentleman Bates Post lifted the play
from one thrilling incident to another with
fair success. Ailsa Grahame, as his sweet-
heart, made love efficiently, but failed to rise
to the needs of the more heavily dramatic
moments. Winnington Barnes was a
thoroughly ignoble brewer, and Leslie Victor
was a satisfactorily sentimental prohibi-
tionist. The best performances, however,
came from Gerald Pring and Gertrude Bos-
well as the two old colored parties. The latter
scored a distinct success in her sad telling
of the past misdeeds of her master’s ancestor.

“M.G.S.’s” impressions at a lecture:—
I think it was the Chinese philosopher Chuang
Tzu —a most graceful liar—who related how he once
fell asleep in his garden dreaming he was a butter-
fly, and on being suddenly disturbed could not
certainly inform his awakened senses whether
he was Chuang Tzu who had dreamt he
was a butterfly or a butterfly now dreaming
he was Chuang Tzu. The same sort of
doubt beset the listener at the Adyar Hall, Sydney,
the other evening when Sir Ernest Rutherford per-
formed his magics. The magics are wonderful in
themselves, or the personality of the magician would
have dispelled their wonder. He is as broad as
the typical Maorilander and a good deal taller,
with a wide, amiable, healthy face, strong cheek-
bones and big jaw, large hands that make quick but
powerful gestures—altogether a perfect sledge-
hammer of a man who would penetrate to the essen-
tial character of anything he set himself to inquire
into, even the strike-germ. Hence, when he informed
the audience that there were so many atoms in a
lump of gas the size of his rather large " thumb that
if every man, woman and child on this overcrowded
planet started counting them, each at the rate of 100
to the minute, it would take a thousand years to
complete the tally, all believed him; and when he
said he had weighed single members of this prodigious
family, again all believed him. Sir Ernest
stated that the law of chance operated in the
atom-world, and showed some photographs to illustrate
the fact. This is comforting. It keeps the atoms
constantly on the move speculating on fresh sure
things to make up for previous losses; and motion,
I understand, is essential to material existence. If
an infinitely small Tom Walsh induced all the atoms
to walk off their ships at once, presumably the
universe would fall to pieces.

Charley s Aunt,” which for over 30 years
has been giving theatregoers the giggles, has
been turned into a film, and Sydney is storm-
ing Hoyt s, where Syd Chaplins plays the
part of the spurious “aunt.” It is a wel-
come change from the mawkish film of the
moment. Nothing so good is in sight else-
where.
The third Gayle Wyer ‘revue at Sydney
Fullers should appeal to commercial travel-
lers. As a. member of the profession that
wangles the best rooms in country hotels,
Gayle Wyer, with the assistance of Vera
Benson and a brilliantly-costumed ballet, em-
barks upon an orgy of chucklesome adven-
tures, with a number of incidental catchy
airs. Corona’s asset is his ability to produce
tolerable music from a cornet, and the Megan
brothers seem assured of a good public back-

The Old Secessionists :
Good stuff and merely pretty meet at the Society
of Artists’ show in Sydney. The production of pot-
boilers is not the sole occupation of all the exhibitors,
but it keeps some of them busy. The success already
achieved by various exponents of this fuel-collecting
business has been so conspicuous that others have been
emboldened to do likewise and in much the same
manner. The result is small improvement over
many previous shows, and none over some.
This year’s exhibition is enlarged by numerous
loan pictures by Orpen, William Nicholson, Augustus
John and other English workers in the field.
Orpen’s study of Pavlova, a stunning picture of a
woman physically tired but mentally alert after the
wild excitement of the ballet, infects the eye with
joy. and stirs the soul a little; a self-portrait has
been done bn wood, a large area of which has
been left unpainted without spoiling the epigram of
the face. Augustus John has a Bernard Shaw with
weak eyelids closed over the dead flesh—an effective
way of emphasising that the mind is still very much
alive. George Lambert; is an Australian who breathes
freely in the same altitudes of cool efficiency as these
two. A portrait of A.. A. Rankin, in which the
flame-like Lambert hands are more than usually out
of place, is elegantly drawn, but somewhat empty
of appeal: the pencil drawing of an old soldier's
head, for which the National Gallery paid 60 guineas,
is a happier exercise. Hans Heysen’s still lifes are
also brilliant bits of painting that likewise leave
the beholder strangely cold; but in No. 67, "Rising
Morning Mist,” the artist has plaited the confusion
of the Australian bush into a feeling composition,
although the valley looks much deeper than the
cattle will admit. Longstaff has not seized oh Hugh
D. Mclntosh with great avidity, but Norman Carter
has put John D. Moore’s dogged look successfully on
“the NIGGER .” AT SYDNEY ROYAL.

record. The latter’s own panel is distinctly dis-
appointing after the fine display he gave in a one-
man show not long ago. The model for the cliff
in No. 155 might just as well have been a waterside
worker’s trousers.
Gruner throws in some jejune efforts, all dated
1905; and J. Muir Auld struggles with or
some similar medium in Nos. 136 and 139. Quite
wonderfully well done, in a photographic manner, is
No. 162, “Lunch Oh! ” by Percy Lindsay; and Daryl
Lindsay, who has also attracted the attention of the
National Gallery, deserves praise at any rate for
refraining from modelling himself on the high priest
of the family. Lionel found cutting pictures into
wood came easily, and in consequence hasn’t greatly
advanced on his first pleasing efforts. Maorilander
W. A. Bowring’s portrait of a lady in a figured
shawl holding a cigarette (she has evidently rolled
it herself) comes at one vividly; it has feeling as
well as drawing. Charles Lloyd Jones has painted
Parliament House, Canberra, looking like a Tibetan
lamasery, but without the prayer-wheel spinners who
are due after the next election; and the virginal
Mac Queen, of Bananaland, who owes nothing to any
school of art, continues to interpret the Great Out-
back in his individual manner. Howard Ashton
has frolicked through some tropical landscapes some-
what in the sprightly mariner of the local bullock-
cart—his Hawkesbury River scenes are better, though
also non-transparent. B. E. Minns has more nice
clean gums.
In the rest of the anthem first place is given to
Thea Proctor, who has three figures standing in
rigor mortis as they died. Her fans attract more.
R. Keith Harris has three unambitious water-colors,
which are nevertheless just right; Sydney Smith sends
a - clever blacksmith’s shop interior. In No. 129 G.
K. Townshend has taken a stylish angle on the N. S.
Wales coast, and Gladys Owen is saying things better
in a smaller compass. Adrian Feint, who has two
pen drawings, is sensitive to delicate effects, but
needs to strengthen his drawing; and Margaret Pres-
ton’s deco,rations tend to become too flat and her
color too exciting.
The most alluring picture in the show is George
Bell’s “Summer Day in Suffolk,’’ in which two naked
girls are lying on a bank watching a model yacht.
They are having a delightful holiday in which the
clean fresh paint helps the spectator’s eye to join.
In sculpture, G. Rayner Hoff romps home in a
field of one. The large figure with the swelling hips
and aggressive torso labelled “Heroic’’ needs to be
placed between a gigantosauros and a gasometer to be
seen in right perspective. The two Binghi heads are
nicely modelled.
&
The revival of “The Silver King” at the
Melbourne Koyal on Saturday proved a
popular event; and larger audiences than
the Muriel Starr company has been enter-
taining for some time are likely so long as
the old classic drama runs. Yet the per-
formance hardly bears comparison with the
best remembered productions of the story of
the man who, awaking from a drunken
stupor, believes he is the murderer of Geof-
frey Ware, and, flying from the country, dis-
covers a silver-mine, returning ultimately
to re-establish the fortunes of his family
and learn that he is innocent. The weak-
ness in this presentation is amongst the prin-
cipals. As Denver, Frank Harvey, whose
staginess is showing an alarming growth,
adopts trite and uninspiring methods, failing
to warm the audience to the essential synt
pathy; the Denver of the first act is merely
an Unpleasant drunken weakling for whom
the scorn of Geoffrey Ware is deserved;
Muriel Starr, who Avalks through the part
of Nellie Denver with moments of throaty
emotion* is no more inspiring. The part of
Jaikes is naturally right into the hands of
J, B. Atholwood* and the Spider of Sidney
Stirling and the Elijah Coombe of Herbert
Leigh are sound performances. John Fefn-
side is the blatant Henry Corkett, and does
well enough; and amongst the others a word

acterisation in the part of Susie, the wait-

Though well informed by experience that
Melbourne likes its Shakspeare in very small
doses, Maurice Moscovitch decided that an-
other helping was good for it, and re-staged
the Merchant last Saturday at the King’s.
Artistically, it is excellent; from a business
point of view it is a doubtful venture. Mos-
covitch will always remember Melbourne as
the place in Australia which treated him
least kindly; all the enthusiasm of those
who have seen him fails to bring those who
haven’t. Yet had he, as was anticipated,
staged “Trilby” (in spite of one or two weak-
nesses which cast difficulties would produce)
he would undoubtedly have done packed busi-
ness for a season; numbers of people have
been eagerly looking forward to a revival of
that play. The actor, however, insists on
giving the people what he wants. As Shy-
lock he repeated his vigorous characterisa-
tion of a middle-aged Jew —a characterisa-
tion which, though very fine, loses some sym-
pathy by its suppression of feelings of ten-
derness for his daughter. Nat Maddison is
less well suited as Launcelot Gobbo than in
other parts in which he has been seen in
Melbourne, and lan McLean was rather a
weak Bassanio; otherwise the performance
ran smoothly.

down the scene in which he dresses in a
skirt to show his jability to represent a
woman histrionically, and sits upon a stile
with painful conseqtiances; but it’s a gay

with it are hardly to be noticed in tire gen-
eral enjoyment; they .may be regarded as the
stick that impales the cherry in the cocktail.
The breezy Herscltfel Henlere made the
Melbourne Tivoli bright with quaint tricks
on the piano last Saturday; and he was close
friends with his Audience immediately,
although one of his jojkes, when he got most
of the audience on .its feet with what
threatened to be “GocT, Slave the King,” but
turned out to be “Yes, We Have No Bananas,”
was at the expense of the house. His act
is a musical and full of artis-
try. Marie Lawton is a sweet-voiced singer
who provides her own harp accompaniment;
her greatest triumph was in an extra,
“Kerry Dances.” Miltfm Hayes is in his
last nights; and Will Fyffe was given a
warm send-off.
The Russian violinist Chuhaldin at the
Melbourne Assembly IJall last week was
considerably more impressive than on his
former appearances, and much less uneven;
he opened felicitously with a praeludium
and allegro, and the sympathy of the audi-
ence seemed to provide liirn with inspiration.
Thei-e were several enthusiastic recalls, the
violinist’s own “Alosilia Popovich” having
to be repeated, while Sarasate’s “Faust Fan-
tasia” was another success. But the
musician’s artistic shoulders are not broad
enough to carry the weight of an entire
programme.

“Charley’s Aunt,” one of the few plays
which are actor-proof, was produced at the
New Palace, Melbourne, on Saturday, by
the Neil-Tuohy combination ; and the light,
rippling humor of the old laugh-raiser was
quite well treated by the company. Frank
Neil was the young Lord “Babs” who, to
oblige his pals, disguises himself as the lady
from the place where the nuts come from,
and is pursued by the fortune-seeking solici-
tor, Jefferson Taite, looking more like a
prosperous grocer than a man of the law;
Maurice Tuohy was Jack Chooney; Harry
Fenwick his pal, Charley AVyfeeham; and
Betterton Glover the real Donna Lucia
D’Alvadorez. The girls were brightly por-
trayed by Jessie Page (Kitty Verdun) and
Vera Remee (Amy Spettigue) ; and Lily
Molloy w r as the orphan who recognises in
the bogus aunt the young man who lias made
love to her, and so adds to the complications.

Not often an elocutionary recital gives so
much pleasure as Rita Fleming’s did at the
Melbourne Playhouse on Thursday night.
Heaps of intelligence, decent diction and fine
inflection enabled the good-looking artist,
■who has carried off honors in many com-
petitions, to handle a programme of selec-
tions from “Macbeth” and “As You Like It,”
dramatic pieces, and monologues to her own
accompaniment—a brilliant rendering of
Byron’s “Waterloo” among them. Kipling’s
“The Flag of England” and “The West
Wind” by Masefield are others that stood
out conspicuously. Assisting talent included
Geo. F. Grainger, a tenor of most attractive
notes and clear enunciation, but requiring
a little more punch in his work.

“The Street Singer,” at Adelaide Royal,
shows itself to be a sugary piece of sentiment.
The acting is rather remarkable. Not only
does Gladys Moncrieff score heavily as singer
and duchess, Claude Flemming in an un-
usual part of self-sacrifice and Stigant as
a woman-hater; but Nellie Payne (now very
popular in Adelaide) has a good part as
Stigant’s tamer, and Leslie Holland a strong
Jewish character. The play has been found
sufficiently attractive to complete the season.

“Ces”: Frank Neil, who has just begun
a season of melodrama at the Melbourne
Palace, was for donkey’s years a member of
Cole’s Bohemian Company which toured all
over Australia, tickling the ears of the
groundlings in a huge tent when there wasn’t
a hall available. Neil played every part,
from villain to juvenile lead, in these shows,
which frequently were changed four and five
times in a week. Old King Cole, of the
flowing locks, the cheroot and the sombrero,
is, by the way, still on deck, and may be
often seen taking the air in Melbourne. A
son-in-law now controls the Bohemians.
“F.A.”: Another Australian has “got
there” in London. John Kirby, well
known as a comedian and producer
with Hugh Ward’s musical shows, left Mel-
bourne only three months ago and opened
on Saturday night, September 5, in a new
revue at the Lyceum in the West End. A
cabled report says the show was a big suc-
cess. and that Kirby received excellent per-
sonal notices.
"Hamfat”: Howard Edie, who has divided
his time between conducting a school of
oratory in America and acting as impres-
ario—he piloted the Clierniavsky Trio
through Australia—has dropped into the
chair of elocution in the Melbourne Conser-
vatorium of Music’s new venture. Edie met
with an accident in Sydney whilst with the
Cherniavskys, a fall downstairs injuring his
spine, and it was feared that he would have
to lie in plaster of paris for four years; but
Dr. Glesson got to work after seven months
and mended him.
“T.P.”: “Hamfat” (B. 3/9/’25) is right
about Alice Barnett. Mrs. Brough, charm-
ing and graceful, played the Fairy Queen of
“lolanthe” in Melbourne, and many of the
lines fell, flat; but when Afict? Barnett played
in “The Mikado” at the Princess, the satire
came to life. Little Billy Elton made an
appropriate foil to the massive actress in the
various comic operas. To see the comedian
trying to reach high enough to pat the lady's
cheek while he gurgled “My precious little
popsy-wopsy ” was sufficient to hold up tiie
action for a couple of minutes.
“Maolsa” : It is time somebody took hold
of the method of
teaching singing in
Vic. State schools
by the scruff of its
neck. Go to any
school while the
carolling is in pro-
gress, and anyone
with a musical ear
will marvel at the
difference between
the joyously free
and naturally round
tone of the play-
ground voice and
the forced and flat
tonelessness of the
schoolroom voice.
Boys have a natu-
ral voice surpassing
any woman’s. But
it is smothered
from the start. It
would be interest-
in g to compare
thirty 10-year-old
voices after two
years under a State
strainer with an
equal number under
a trainer with, say,
English cathedral-
choir experience.
Pronunciation, too,
is bad; and the art
of singing “me” on
any note higher
than the third space
of the stave is an
effort that is trying
to any listener-in.
Scholarships and
won’t help.
What is wanted
most is an example
to follow. Let the

lowed by some

amples of how-not-
fn-rln-if*
to-ao-ir.
“E.T.”: “The Dream” speech in “The
Silver King” is a veritable nightmare to
many exponents of Wilfred Denver. It was
originally “written in” the part by Henry
Arthur Jones to give Wilson Barrett (who,
whatever his shortcomings as a leading man,
was a splendid elocutionist) a chance to
show off his fine voice. The long monologue
is worth doing well, even though at this
time of day it may seem old-fashioned and
an excrescence. Many Denvers forget that
the speech is addressed to the old servitor,
Jaikrs, who is on the stage all the time it is
delivered. One well-known Silver King so
far disremembered the fact that it was his
custom to declaim it to the gallery, the while
the orchestra obliged with a tremolo accom-
paniment.
“L.E.”: The revival of some representa-
tive play of the past usually shows that in
the art of drama there has been progress,
not reaction. “The Silver King,” acclaimed
by the Firm as “the greatest drama of all
time,” looks very seedy to a modern audi-
ence. Another, once deeply esteemed, was
Charles Klein’s “The Lion and the Mouse,”
which failed in revival to live up to its repu-
tation. Even Pinero, when he is given a
turn, looks more like an awful warning than
a shining example. Apart from the absurd
and conventionalised characters in these old
plays, from the technical point of view what
could be more naive than the way people are
pushed in and out of the room, so that the
chief characters can be left alone for their
great scene! And some of the asides are
incredible. “Let the letter in the lower
drawer!” the heroine says aside to the hero
amid a group of interested people. This talk
about the wonderful plays there used to be
in the dear dead days beyond recall is all
nonsense. The drama has improved in every
way during the last 30 years, and it’s about
time we saw more of it in Australia.
“Ancient Prompter”: How many Silver
Kings has Australia seen since George
Titheradge first played the part? I can
recall Julius Knight, Harry Plimmer, Henry
Kolker, William Desmond and Walter Bent-
ley. Frank Harvey is the latest. There
must 'be a few others. Titheradge was the
most satisfying exponent of the part, and
I would place Plimmer next. The ancient
drama (it was written nearly 40 years ago)
still brings in considerable royalties to its
surviving author, Henry Arthur Jones.
“C. Ockney”: It has taken a long time
for “De Luxe Annie” —the ingenious Ameri-
can play in which Emelie Polini made her
first bow to Australian audiences seven years
ago—to reach London. It has just been put
on at the Duke of York’s, with an almost
unknown actress, Mary Servoss, in the lead.
Norman Page, who was stage-director of
“The Blue Bird” when Maeterlinck’s fantasy
was done in Australia and also played the
Cat, is the producer.
“R.K.D.N.”: According to Louis Essou
(B. 13/8/’25) Melbourne has seen some un-
satisfactory professional performances of
Bernard Shaw plays. Sydney must be
reckoned more fortunate. A capital render-
ing of “Fanny’s First Play” was submitted
by that good actor, Hugh Buckler, and his
company some few years ago, soon after the
piece was produced in London. Also one
remembers professionals essaying “Arms and
the Man,” “Man and Superman” and “The
Doctor’s Dilemma” with all-round complete-
ness. Amateurs may satisfy their kind
friends in front in such pieces, but the author
himself does not approve of their help—
although he may cheerfully take the fees
for the performances. He himself is always
careful to select the finest professional cast
procurable—and he’s not a bad judge.
“C.K.”: W. S. Gilbert had no liking for
tenors. He told me that at one time he
contemplated eliminating them altogether
from his operas, but the traditions had to
be observed—Sullivan must have his quar-
tette, the tenor must play opposite the
soprano, and so on. Most of the tenors
who had been engaged from the commence-
ment of the collaboration had possessed
organs of the “light” variety, and their speak-
ing voices were pitched so high that they
were practically colorless. They had not
the variety of inflection or weight to give
proper value to Gilbert’s lines. Naturally
he resented this, and he had a very irritat-
ing habit of expressing his disapproval. He
would shrug his shoulders, drop his hands
and walk away. Eventually a singer came
along who was a little more robust than his
predecessors and whose speaking voice was
much deeper. This suited Gilbert, and once
he stopped the progress of a full rehearsal,
when the management and several other im-
portant people were present, to express his
satisfaction. So long as this lucky tenor
was available, he was cast for every revival
and new production at the Savoy.
“Philm Up”: Captain Frank Hurley,
having made a considerable stir in England
with his New Guinea film, “Pearls and
Savages,” has been engaged by the Oswald
Stoll All-British Picture firm to direct two
adventure stories in tropical-island settings.
Hurley has left London with the nucleus of
a dramatic co. which includes a clever son
of Bramsby Williams, the Dickens imper-
sonator, and will pick up his remaining
artists in Sydney. Queer that such an enter-
prise should be engineered by a firm in Eng-
land, where Australian exhibitors assure us
the picture business is dead.
“Noise Within”: The Brisbane Repertorv
Society put on Milne’s “Dover Road” a
month or so ago, and is next going to attempt
Barrie’s “Alice Sit-by-the-Fire.” It is a
puzzle to me why this charming fantasy has
not been, more popular with repertory
societies in Australia. Until it was pro-
duced in Melbourne a week or two ago, it
had not, I think, been put on since 3914.
when Lizette Parlies played Amy. The Bris-
bane society has got as producer for “Alice”
a local pressman who did some mummipg
with Allan Wilkie.
THE REHABILITATION OF KIT MARLOWE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“After a lapse of 332 years it has been established,
by the patient research of an American, that the
poet-dramatist Christopher Marlowe was not killed,
as has always been supposed, in a quarrel with a
lewd serving-man over a lady of easy virtue, but
by a companion with whom he had a dispute over a
tavern reckoning. Documents have been unearthed to
show that the other man received the Queen’s
pardon.”
Thus Truth shall out, albeit centuries hid,
And falsely cherished figments effervesce!
Muse not upon the roystering things they did—
Those were the spacious days of Good Queen Bess.
We should have borne ourselves no better, I guess,
In times like those, who worse iambics scrawl.
Ana Shakspeare scarce had reigned supreme unless
They’d killed Kit Marlowe in a tavern brawl.
Time that of stigma cruel he were rid.
Proclaim the news that makes the odium less.
Granted that off this mortal coil he slid
In circs that cause the moralist distress ;
And such a mode of exit, I confess,
Might make his chance of Heav’n look parlous small.
Still Fame no longer shall the cause suppress
They killed Kit Marlowe in a tavern brawl.
A SCREW LOOSE SOMEWHERE.
“Surely the artist must he a lunatio!"
“Oh, I don’t know. The picture is sold, any way."
“Well, then, it must he the buyer. ”
Granted he fell the clash of steel amid;
And there were oaths, no doubt, in hot excess,
Yells for the watch, I’d like to bet a quid,
And gen’rally a devil of a mess;
Cleansed is at last his scutcheon, ne’ertheless,
Of what was held the darkest blot of all.
It wasn’t for a demirep’s caress
They killed Kit Marlowe in a tavern brawl.
’Twas who should pay the bill took off the lid
Of passion, turned good-fellowship to gall.
It wasn't for a doxy—God forbid!—

THE PRICE
OF WHISKY
AUSTRALIAN Whisky Distillers are
** not taking advantage ofi higher
protection to increase prices and profits
OLD COURT WHISKY remains the same price.
OLD COURT WHISKY is the purest in the world,
guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government to be 100
per cent. Pure Malt Whisky. It is distilled and bottled under
Government Supervision. It is guaranteed to be matured in
wood for more than five years.
No other whisky can claim
all these qualifications
Isn’t it common sense, therefore, to insist on OLD
COURT WHISKY, rather than pay more for Imported
Whiskies, especially as they may contain cheap, foreign spirit,
and are not guaranteed by law to be up to the high Australian
Standard? Ask for OLD COURT WHISKY—try it on its
merits. If you have not yet tasted it you will be surprised
at its superior qualities.
You may meet with
Anti - Australian
Propaganda
Treat it as it deserves, knowing that whoever is respon-
sible has not the best interests of Australia and Australians
at heart. Also, get it firmly in your mind—that, so far as
Australian Spirits are concerned.

important as the foundation of your house.
With Goulding Sidecars the patented floating
axle ensures comfort for the rider as well as
the passenger, and far less strain on the motor-
cycle.
The springs and lugs in black are those which have
been redesigned with the effect of more comfort and

The Most Profitable Method
of Handling Paint Oils
The Wayne system (illustrated) increases profits because it so
effectively prevents waste due to evaporation, deterioration,
thickening and loss through inaccurate measures of both in-
coming and outgoing oil.
By means of barrel cradle, track and dash every particle of in-
coming oil is stored without spillage in galvanized steel tanks
which are constructed to keep out all other elements, except
the air which replaces oil dispensed.
Measuring pumps accurately dispense pints, quarts, hall-gal-
lons and gallons as desired directly into customer’s container.
Standard equipment includes tank with 10 by 16 inch bolted
cover manhole, ball vent, metal dip gauge, drip pan, extension
tube, pump with Type A nozzle, fifteen gallon discharge
register and quantity scale.
For complete details of this or other Wayne equipment for the
storage, measuring and pumping of oil or petrol, address:

THE Pro-phy-lac-tic tooth brush is scientifically designed to
reach and thoroughly clean every part of every tooth, as
well as the gums, at every brushing.
It has a curved surface that fits the mouth perfectly. It has
saw-tooth bristle-tufts that reach in between the teeth. It has
a large end tuft that cleans the backs of the front teeth and the
backs of the hard-to-reach molars.
No other tooth brush has all the features of the Pro-phy-lac-
tic, no other brush reaches into every little crack and crevice as
does the Pro-phy-lac-tic. Pro-phy-lac-tic Tooth Brushes last
longer too because of the high quality of the bristles.
Made in three sizes: Adult, Small and Baby, in medium, soft and
hard bristles. Always sold in the yellow box. Look for the fac-simile
hyphenated name on both box and brush handle.

5i per cent.
War Conversion Loan
The interest rate —5| per cent. —is undeniably
a good one. The interest is exempt from State
Income Tax, and is, therefore, really equivalent
to more than s>> per cent, as compared with an
ordinary investment.
The Investor has the Option
of investing for 6 years, or 11 years, or 16 years;
of paying at once the full amount of the subscrip-
tion, or 10 per cent., or a greater percentage, as
a deposit. Interest on the amount paid will begin
to accumulate immediately at the rate of per
cent, per annum.
Advantages of Conversion
are obvious. Every holder of War Loan 4\ per
cent. Bonds maturing in December next who
agrees to convert into the new Loan will begin
to receive interest at the rate of per cent, as
from the date on which he lodges his application.
The New per cent. Loan is
Free of State Income Tax

Mackeroo : Why, you’ll find it in Webster’s.

in their dreams... .Aril: Perhaps you’re right; but
she has lived in the thick of them for the past
25 years... .5.1. W.; We’ve got no boundaries. We’d
print a par. about a ping-pong match if you could
make it interesting enough to all Australia....
A.J.H.: “Feng-Shui” lately ploughed that paddock.
....Flick; Good yarn, but it’s over-age... .Cluny:
You’ve left it too late... .N. Amloc; Thanks ; not
printable; but some of the information will come
in handy... .Willoughby T.; Dull style and common-
place matter. Yet there must be heaps of interesting
things in you Hec D.; Sorry, but your subject
has been teased to tatters... .T. 5.8.: Another got in,
ahead of you. But the matter is quite g00d....
Pasquaie; Scintillates like a pound of putty....
G.C. (Petersham) ; Bring in your “Unlucky Stock-
man” :
Nine years of hard riding on Western * plain
Had failed to ease that aching pain
Of a soul that was weary, and tiring of life,
At not being able to find a wife.
From township to city, from station to ranch,
This quest for a female had led him a dance,
Until, on arrival at Mulga Flat town,
The first things to greet him were two eyes of brown.
In love with those eyes he fell at first sight,
And swore he would marry the owner that night,
But with this intention fixed fast in his brain
The clouds opened up, and it started to rain.
....Video: Lame repetition of a gag used already.
.... Roy T.; Melodrama in bad verse.... P. O. Mac:
The verse is as lumpy as the ideas are tired....
I-larry P.; The lines have a little quality, but not
enough... .W.H.L.; It’s correct in form, but that’s
only the beginning of the matter... .A.F.M.: A
tale that has been told too often... .C.E.S.: Well
enough handled, but too obvious and mechanical....
R.D.C.: A lot of words to say very little... .King
Olaf; Not striking enough.... Dojo: Not the goods
for this barrow. .. .E.J.G.: The dances miss....
E. ; No use here.... Bellerive; “The Veteran
Diver” gives a thrilling picture of life in the deeps:
I’m eighty-one to-morrow, lads;
I’m one of the rare old sort;
My diving feats are at an end,
I’m nearing the final port.
Time travels like the whistling winds,
They call me the grey had been;
I’ve breasted the briny many years,
And some devilish freaks I’ve seen—
Fierce reptiles of gigantic size,
Grim demons of the waves,
Plunging forth with rapid speed.
From out their slimy caves;
Vampires and blue-finned sharks,
Small fishes by galore ;
I’ve often raised my hatchet
And feared my days were o’er.
But despite the scanny dangers,
The game appealed to me—
To salvage sunken vessels
At the bottom of the sea.
....A.A.A.; Doesn’t make us believe it’s true....
F. : Misses by some distance.... Llessur; Correct
sonnets with no lift in them... .Rex B.: The quality
of the verse supplies the answer.... L.S. (Linton):
Easy verse that says too little... .Alan B.: There’s
a suggestion of something; try to get a better idea
of the shape of good verses.. .W.L.W.: The drunk
mouse is a feeble animal.... Arthur W.: Far, far
away.... Adam; Ancient ideas in rather lame verse.
. ...H.C. (East Prahran) : Not much of a yarn....
Marroo: None up.... Alice J.: Re-hash of common
places.... Clutha R.: Misses, but not a bad shot.
... .M.M. (Elmhurst) : Worth better work... .T. 5.8.:
Not nearly... .R.F.T.: The yarn wants more marrow
in its bones.... J.0.L.: Not well enough done....
P.L.S.: It wanders on, scattering pearls of common-
place. .. .A.T.H.; Too flimsy Peter N.: The yarn
wanders on without getting to anything worth hav-
ing. .. .S.V.R.; Sorry, but you don’t, appear to have
much verse-sense.... Charles C.; The sonnet is
better built than the other, but there isn t much in
either... .T.M. (Strathfield): The verse is very
clumsy... .D.W.C.: Nowhere near.... Nob: The
ragged versification spoils it... .W.W.R.: Sounds
painfully h0110w... .A.G.C.: Hope you’ll do better
in six years’ time... .W.B. (Kangaroo Point) :
Rugged verse on a theme that it would take some-
thing strong to carry... .E.H.G.: Idea poor and
handling bad.... Koala: Pretty hard on Gippsland to
be dosed with all those commonplaces... .G.R.M.:
The yarn moves heavily and then gets bogged....
Oliver B.; Well, here’s luck: —
On our new selection it is,
Not far from our dear old home;
What fun. Oh gee-whiz!
With plenty of room to roam.
Yes! well, everything is just about ready—
Tucker-bags lined, two pairs pants, not greedy;
We’ve got our little hut 12 by 14 :
By Jove, it’s hard at it we’ve been.
Now Dad swears we must push on,
That we haven’t too much time;
So we whistle, and sing a song,
Oh, if we drily ’ad a soda an’ lime!
.... Curl; But what does a butterfly want a ladder
for? We’ve known one that could climb the scent
of a rose V.L’H.: Been written very often in verse
just like that... .C.R.L.: No use to u5....E.8.
(Katoomba) : Those eyes don’t sparkle as they should.
. ...G.E.K.: Don’t worry about the “inspiring-
verses” being allowed “to die with” you. They
started dead.... Geraldine: Slovenly and far 0ff....
A.C. (South Gippsland) : Very poor in both matter
and manner... .R.0.W.: Not bad of its kind, but it
is a poor kind... .AY.J.R.: You have a savage notion
of rhyme.... Bourke: Not up....A.G. (Punchbowl):
There isn’t enough in it... . Arthur G.: Weak and
pale.... Donald D.; Doesn’t make a yarn.... Aneb :
We can’t publish that sort of thing....
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
D.C.; It isn’t humanly possible. .. .H.S.: If the
whole thing was as well done as the hands are, it
would be a good picture. This is most unusual.. . .
E.E.C.; Very rugged art....T.H.: The background
took some unravelling... .J.P.: Like a two-headed
calf, grotesque without being funny. .. .H.C.L.: Tour
cow-country idyll is faithfully done, but crude.
“Wang”: In my suburb there is the firm

Musical dignity
and sincerity
Did you know that Thomas A. Edison has invented a human voice reproducing
instrument that does not betray itself in the very presence of the living artists?
This he has actually done, and more than fifty of the world’s greatest artists
have sung or played in direct platform comparison with the New Edison
Re-Creation of their voices or instruments.
On these occasions musically-critical audiences discovered to their amazement
that not a tone, not a subtle color varied in the slightest degree—the most delicate
variations were exquisitely matched and the voice of instrument and artist shaded
into each other perfectly.
By one of the most marvellous achievements of modern science the problem of
perfect music for the home has thus been solved.

“Sturt”: The dormant license of the
former Grand Central Hotel in Adelaide
(, lately mopped up in the drapery store of
the owners, F'oy and Gibson) has just been
kept alive for another three months with the
blessing of S.A. Licensing Court. In fact,
U. G. Nesbit, the chairman, remarked that
the city badly needs another big residential
hotel. I*. W. Bennett, for a syndicate, men-
tioned that an option has been secured on
a North-terrace site, and it is planned to
spend about £200,000 on a really up-to-date
place. Victorian capital is interested largely,
and a Melbourne firm of architects will pro-
bably get the job.

“Solo”: “Xarnite” (B. 20/8/ - 25) is cor-
rect in his statement that the diameter of
wool fibres is altered by climatic influences
and the state of pastures. In the Brisbane
market, where the bulk of the wool offered
is of extra-fine quality under normal condi-
tions, it is noticeable, after an extra-good
season,-that the quality drops from seventies
to sixty-fours. Intenseness of crimp is a
merino characteristic, but it is not correct to
say that the crimp in merino wools is quite
distinct from the wave in wools of other
breeds. Crimp is a characteristic of wool
as distinct from hair:,it is apparent in all
wools, from coarse thirty-sixes, Lincoln, to
the finest eighties a d upwards in merinos:
when clearly defined the wool is always
spoken of by buyers as showing good char-
acter. I won’t argue on the cause of crimp
in wool, but it I remember aright the cells
and serrations- of which the fibre is com-
posed have something to do with it. I cannot
agree that cold climates produce the finest-
quality wools: Scotch and English wools are
very coarse; Maoriland, with a similar
climate to England, produces practically all
coarse wools. It is incorrect to say that
strong-woolled sheep taken from a hot lati-
tude to a cold one will fine down ill quality.
The exact opposite happens; Queensland
wool-growers have to make repeated pur-
chases of the stronger-quality southern rams
to help build up the staple of their sheep,
which tend to fine too much on account Of
the climate; I think it only natural for
Nature to give a more vigorous protective
growth of wool to sheep in Tasmania than
to those needing it so much less in Queens-
land. Anyhow, I have found it to be so,
and I’ve classed and bought wool in every
State in Australia.
* * * *
“Wart”; The headmasters of the Laun-
ceston (Tas.) State schools have hit on an
idea with possibilities. They have formed
an employment bureau for boys leaving
school, and the Retail Traders’ Ass. and
the Chambers of Commerce and Manu-
facturers have given it their blessing. The
secretary’s duties will be carried out by
V. Dowie, the truant inspector, and at his
office employers may obtain the masters’
opinions of the boys and copies of their
exam, results. If it saves good artisans
from becoming indifferent clerks and checks
the drift into dead-end occupations, it will
justify itself.
* * * *
“Sixenate” : After II years as an insolvent
who was able, being the possessor of a
kindly brother, to flash about in a well-
tailored condition in motor-cars, Vcre
Herbert Casey has again been granted his
discharge—it was granted previously, but
the Vie. Full Court set the discharge aside
upon appeal. In the dim past a tailoress
from whom the insolvent admitted receiving
loans and goods obtained a judgment against
him for breach of promise, whereupon Casey
sought refuge in bankruptcy. Now Judge
Motile has delivered a long judgment, ex-
plaining why he thinks the debtor, whose
style has remained uncramped by his alleged
lack of assets, should be granted his dis-
charge ; but he loaded the discharge, which
is to issue in a month, with a condition that
any negotiable assets developed out of
patents, inventions and shares held by Casey
should be subject to the claim of the creditor
who caused the bankruptcy. Considering
all the evasions possible, it is likely to be
poor consolation to the creditor.
* * * *
“Adarnascus”: Evidence that the advocacy
of hornless cattle is having effect was seen
at the Brisbane Show, when for the first
time polled Hereford beef cattle were ex-
hibited. They caused much comment among
cattlemen and varying opinions were passed.
The verdict, however, probably influenced by
the fact of the Show committee being in
favor of dehorning, seemed to be that the
practice should be followed. The old type
of Hereford breeder is not yet convinced, but
the advantages of dehorning are being so
persistently urged that it is only a matter
of time when the practice will be general.
“Swiss” : Why, oh why, do the makers of
the good Australian whisky not go in for an
Australian advertising campaign in its be-
half? At present a lot of it is sold in a
surreptitious, half-ashamed sort of way. Why
not come out into the open, and proclaim it
for what it is—a good and wholesome spirit?
It is due to advertising alone that the im-
ported goods, at a much higher price, are still
in the market at all. Whilst almost every
other article of commerce stands at about
100 per cent, advance on pre-war prices, im-
ported whisky is at 500 per cent., comparing
"in bond” prices. Nothing but advertis-
ing could keep that up; and nothing but a
policy of penurious timidity on the Austra-
lian distillers’ part keeps the Australian from
recognising his very own good stuff when he
meets it in a tumbler.
* * * *
“Telopea”: A par. (B. 13/8/’25) men-
tions that Professor Wood-Jones, of Adel-
aide. has been urging the importance of fur-
farming. This subject has not been lost
sight of in the Speck. During last session
of Parliament the Fur Farms Encourage-
ment Act was passed, and as a result there
is the probability of a large area being set
aside to be used by a private co. as a fur-
farm. Should the scheme develop as anti-
cipated, we may look forward within the
next few years to some genuine Australian
shows; and competition for the best-furred
kangaroos, wallabies and ’possums will be
even keener than that which n.ow exists be-
tween leading sheep-breeders.

“Kriz”: Dirty water along the pearling-
grounds lately forced a fleet of 50 or 60 Broome
(W.A.) luggers to move further up the coast to
Roebuck Bay. Here they struck clear water,
and during the week five valuable pearls
were brought into Broome, varying from 40
to 100 grains. When the boats were seen
working in the bay old-timers reckoned that
some valuable baroque and pearls would be
brought in, and they were right.
“F.D.1.”: Twenty years ago a Broken
Hill friend, Jack Kermeer, had an experi-
ence similar to the one related by “Pick"
(B. 27/8/’25). He was unloading chaff
when the horses started and Jack fell on
the pole of the trolly; and he told us after-
wards that he distinctly heard his mother’s
voice tell him to grip the pole. His mother
had died in the Isle of Man a few hours
earlier; the news came to him by mail five
weeks later.
“Pick”: After 22 years of experimenting
Harry Berry, of Ashfield (N.S.W.), per-
fected a process by which he can preserve
in .their original form and color maiden-
hair and other Australian ferns. He has
created a sufficient local demand for the
ornaments to keep himself and family busy
all the seasons round, but he is after an
expansion of his business; and the looked-
for etu’ly establishment of a European
market for the goods is expected to swell
the trade to large proportions.
“Sixenate”: A very small pitfall may
upset the applecart of crime. A St. Kilda
(Vic.) woman, happening to pay a visit
to the remote suburb of Brunswick, was
lately the cause of the arrest of several
people* and the seizure of a store of stolen
goods valued at over £2OO0 —she had care-
lessly .looked into the window of a small
secondhand shop and recognised an insig-
nificant* ornament there as her own. In
another recent case a man, picking up a
picture cheaply in a Fitzroy shop, sent it,
for safekeeping to the house of a friend in
Oakleig3i, and this friend immediately iden-
tified iti as one that had been stolen from
his home eight months before.
“Verifi” : The yarn in a recent Bulletin
of the man who was marooned aloft in a
kibble recalls a similar incident that occurred
near Wailii (M.L.). Taking a short cut
by this route was strictly against rules, but
one Saturday two miners decided to risk it,
and stanted off ini the aerial crib. Then bad
luck caipe —the machinery ceased work un-
expectedly ! It was midwinter, the cold
grew intense, it began to rain heavily, and
a bitter wind arose as darkness came on.
Drenchedp cramped and half-frozen, the
wretched men had to sit. motionless all night,
with the prospect of spending all next day
in the sata© fashion. Fortunately they were
discerned in the morning, and their plight
reported; and two more dead than alive pas-
sengers were yanked out. of their perilous
quarters.
“Simon”: A recent par. about a silver-
wedding that culminated in a fight re-
minded me of Bill Woolaway, once the
official best man of a western N.S.W. town-
ship which had a proper appreciation for a
bloke who could speak a piece at the wedding-
breakfast, M.C. the hop afterwards, and
scrape the fiddle a bit. when the concertina-
player was tired. Bill was in great request
until tlftn time came when he invariably got
blithered and blasphemous early in the pro-
ceedings; becoming argumentative and quarrel-
some later. After the last wedding at which
Bill officiated he was driving home with the
happy palir in a spring-cart when a dispute
arose thaifc had to be settled in the roadway
while the bride, holding Dobbin, looked on.
Bill liaviitg been suppressed, the newly-weds
drove on, leaving Bill to follow at his con-
venience. About midnight we were in the
middle of a set of kitchen lancers when a
neighboring cocky rushed in to tell us Bill
was on bis way across the paddock with a
spattered shirt front and the wrist parts of
his white gloves still hanging to him. A
fiddle w r as under one arm and a young sap-
ling under the other. There being much
conjecture as to Bill’s mission we unani-
mously left in a hurry.
“Die Mihi” : The Stock Exchange of Mel-
bourne has moved from Queen-street into
new premises in Chancery-lane, alias Eittle
Collins-street. One immovable monu-
ment to past glory has been left be-
hind —the safe deposit—and a gilded
banking-chamber has been built by the
E., S. and A. Bank over the old vesti-
bule. George Verdon, once a ship’s chand-
ler at Willi am stown, next Agent-General
for Victoria, and then general man-
ager of the old E., S. and A. C. Bank, built
all their offices in the _ Gothic style. The
mullioned windows, which caught the dust
and stopped the light, gave them a cloistered
appearance, and made customers wish
avidly for an overdraft wherewith to com-
mune in secrecy and silence. The Stock
Exchange architect used the Gothic style
for his fagade, and the grotesque gargoyles
always reminded the passer-by of the brokers
within scowling like Quasimodo and grab-
bing for commissions. The Stock Exchange
was a poor little concern for the 20-odd years
between the last gold boom (1870-73) at
Sandhurst and the first land-boom in Mel-
bourne in 1887-91, and it went into the first
Broken Hill boom neck and heel, head and
shoulders. It was a hilarious time. I remember
taking an order into the room for a specu-
lating syndicate of rich investors for 500
Hills at' £l2, 500 Block Tens at £lO, 500
Centrals at £l3 and 500 B. 11. Souths at
£l5, totalling about £25,000. I completed
that order within 20 minutes. Another time
I sold 5000 Trams for round about £8 apiece
in one day. They topped at £8 55., and slid
back over the precipice to 95., the lowest
price they touched during the bank panic.
To-day the virus of an easy half-crown or
five-shillings per cent, for buying and sell-
ing Government and municipal debentures
has poisoned the spirit and changed the
very atmosphere of the Stock Exchange, and
there is no longer an active market for mining
or other speculative stocks. Now and again
an industrial dead-cert, is underwritten or
recommended to investors, but all too rarely.
Why, the modern broker never even tries a
“corner” ! In those older and better days we
had several perfectly delightful “corners”—•
the Round Hill, the Bear Hill, the Earl of
Hopetoun and the Duke of York, for
example.

Miss JACQUELINE
LOGAN, a Beauti-
ful Hollywood
Movie Star, writes:
“I pay strict attention
to my hair. Naturally, I
am extremely careful what I use
on it. Recently some friends, users of
Rexona Soap, induced me to use it. The
first trial converted me to it. Rexona Soap
seems to stimulate the scalp and the hair, and
gives a beautiful lustre.”
Girls! Shampoo Your Hair
with Rexona Soap.
Makes the Hair Bright, Soft and Silky.
Beautiful hair, whether long or shingled, must be kept perfectly clean, or
it soon becomes dull and lifeless. Many concoctions have been advised by beauty
specialists from time to time, but nothing has been found to be so efficacious
as REXONA SOAP.
Shred a little into a basin, pour boiling water over and stir the mixture
hard until the soap has dissolved. Then
massage the head thoroughly with the
shampoo, making the hair
into a fragrant lather.
Rinse in several lots of
clean, warm water, and
dry with warm towels.
This is absolutely the
most luxurious way of
shampooing the hair, but
the soap must be Rexona.

It’s Medicated!

The Tracks of the Trades.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rw'i AKE me back, take me back to the
Tracks of the Trade!
1 Let me wander again in the coco-
palm's shade,
Where the drums of the ocean, in pulsating
roar,
Beat time to the waltz of the waves on the
shore.
Where sunlight and starlight and moonlight
conspire
To speed the gay hours on the Wings of
Desire.
Let me clamber again through the orchid-
bright glade.
Take me back, take me back to the Tracks
of the Trade!
Oh, the hot flame of sunset, the tremulous
light,
Where the afterglow fades to the velvet of
night!
The star-stencilled headland in black
silhouette,
Where the moonbeams are meshed in the
hau tree’s bright net!
Oh, the purple of midnight, the grey mists
of dawn
And the amber that comes when the dark-
ness is gone!
The slow-heaving ocean of gold-spangled jade
When the sun wakes the day in the Tracks
of the Trade!
Let my heart thrill again as the tom-tom’s
dull boom
Floats out from the bush in the flower-
fragrant gloom.
And the shriek of the coniches, the hi-rhi-nc's
swell
Bring word of the dance in the depths of
the dell.
Lead my footsteps again down the forest-
track dim,
Where firelight throws shadows on bosom and
limb
Of the billowing forms of the trim tropic
maids
When the song wakes the dance in the Tracks
of the Trades!
Let my hands close again on the hard-kicking
wheel
As the schooner romps off on a rollicking
reel
To the humming of backstay and sharp-
slatting sail
And the hiss of the comber that smothers
the rail.
Oh, the cadenced lament of the chorusing
shroud
As the spindrift sweeps aft in a feathery
cloud !
Oh, the storm-tumbled seaways we cross
unafraid
As the squall spins tlije spume down the
Tracks of the Trad®!
Take me back, take me hack to the Tracks
of the Trade!
For ’tis weary I am of. the city’s parade,
Of the dust of the traffic, the grey, cheerless
skies,'
And the long lines of people with spiritless
eyes.
Take me back to my green, sunny islands
again,
Away from this treadmill of sorrow and pain ;
Away from this tinsel and gilt masquerade,
Let me live, let me dife in the Tracks of the
Trade!

LEWIS R. FREEMAN.
The Vanishing Dream.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f HE gentlest of dreamy breezes played
over the island, whispering softly
among the hilly 4 undergrowth, trilling
louder in the tremble of the broad palm-
leaves upon the shore, crooning with 4 the
waves that played the tinkling shells upon
the little beach.
The capricious Barrier Sea stretched far
into space. Ages up, it seemed many ages
up, set in the blackest -of velvet cushions,
were the golden pinheads of the stars. Glist-
ening like gold, they were not gold, because
surely they had life, as when you gazed long
at them they would twinkile back and smile
as if in quiet understanding.
Another world, bridged by space unbridg-
able. Almost as unknowable as the tran-
quil thoughts of the man gazing serenely
up. He also lived in a wcfcrld of his own ;
for no man disputed him possession of this
tiny island, which he shared with the birds
of the air and the food-seeking fishes which
ravaged its coral-bound shores), The red fire
lighting up the rugged sunburnit face hummed
insinuatingly that this little wtorld was good.
The man’s gaze dropped presently to the
line of the sea. He half-consciomsly stretched
out a hand towards the fire, juOt as a think-
ing man does to the quiet sympathy of the
dog that sits b]r his side.
“To think,” he spoke softly inbo the listen-
ing night, “that in plaees like this is the
heaven men dream of finding only after
death! It’s a shame they waste their hearts
away in the struggle, while all the time there
are plenty of similar heavens going begging
in his real life, peacefi.il stepping* stones to
the life ever after.”
So the night vmre on imperceptibly, bring-
ing slumber as it is brought to the child.
He was a beachcomber, with tHe island
his kingdom, freedom has life. The dountless
fish that swarmed the reefs kept him 5n meat.
The little cultivation patch, whidh grew
things almost by itself, gave him sweet
“buks,” taro and pumpkins. Pawpaw’ trees,
bird-sown, painted the brown hillsides. The
banana plot bowed its stalks to the ground
under weight of fat fruit. Shady mango-
trees, magnificent in growth of spreading
limbs and heavy dark green foliage, were
speckled thickly with the orange-gold of mag-
nificent fruit. Springs between the little
hills gurgled for him and the birds and
lizards and the humming insects.
For the rest, should he want it. he had
more than plenty, largesse given him by the
sea; for among the corals and across the
sandy bottoms and the mud bottoms and the
seaweed bottoms came beche-de-mer and ven-
turesome pearl oysters. At low tides in the
shallow water, during hours w T hen his mind
needed occupation, he gathered these gifts of
the sea, and smoked them and cured them
and stored them away until the little pile of
slugs and shell mounted to a ton or so. Then
he would signal to a passing lugger and
trade with the skipper or else consign the
shell to Thursday Island, and in three
months’ time, maybe six, a lugger passing
that way would drop him his supply of civil-
ised things. lie could do without these
things quite well. The very sight of
them, silently waiting his pleasure in the
hut, always sent a smile of joy through his
blood that he was quite independent of these
“necessaries.” which represented civilisation
and its drudgery.
The whispering leaves drooped, the sea
slipped within itself and remained immov-
able, the air was on the verge of slumber.
The man rose, eyes half-closed. “And to
think,” he muttered dreamily, “to-morrow,
any day, I may pick up an oyster with a
pearl rivalling Cleopatra’s gem! And 1
don’t want it. Not in the least! Blow the
pearl, civilisation, everything else but the
croon of the sea on the reef, the sun, ever-
lasting peace and sleep!”
* * * *
The days were hot, even for summer. The
granite boulders that had thundered down
from the hillsides to meet their ever-
encroaching enemy the sea, shimmered oily-
black under the fierce rays.
“Too hot to last,” muttered the beach-
comber ; “in another few days there’ll be
a storm.”
He was walking easily along the rippling
sea-edge, naked but for a cloth sarong. He
needed no hat, for his hair was wonderfully
thick, the eyebrows bushy and jutting. In
one hand he carried a four-pronged fish-
spear. In the sarong a sheath-knife. No-
thing else.
The tide was out, leaving isolated the
coral creeks and pools and the tardy fish.
In the pools waved slow, queer-colored things
of life that were neither fish nor plant, and
on the clear sands of the bottom were slow’-
moving shells of wondrous beauty, and flash-
ing fish that had stolen the kisses of the
rainbow darted from the gloom of coral
caverns into the brilliance of clear water.
All life, ravaging life, living to its very
full up to the last glorious moment, an
ecstasy of killing, eating, breeding!
The iron-brown man walked to his throat
in water ; then, sinking easily, he came up
with a big pearl-oyster. Climbing back on
the reef, the water-drops glistening on his
skin, he surveyed the shell with a slow,
appraising smile.
“You’re a beauty, Black Hip,” he said
quietly. “A thing of exceeding grace and
wonderful life, and big enough to house my
last night’s dream-pearl. If you are only
diseased enough, you could be mothering the
gem that would be the envy of all the white-
throated women in the world. And, inci-
dentally, make me almost a millionaire. But
just in case you bear the phantom pearl and
so would spoil the beauty of the day, and of
the days to come—l won’t open you.” He
threw the shell well up on the reef above
high tide.
Walking on, he swung back quickly.
Emerging from a cavity he had glimpsed
the long feelers of a lobster scouting to cross
a sand pool to the feeding-ground of the
further coral.
Lying hidden the man waited until the big
green shellfish showed nearly midway across
the sandy bottom. Jumping erect, he swung
his arm high, lunged down. A squirt of
water hissed from the descending spear; the
frantic lobster was transfixed by the iron
prongs. Killing his squirming prize, the
man threw it up on the reef and walked on.
A barely-seen ripple wavered the mirror-
like surface of a large waterhole. The man’s
arm was instantly poised. The long spear,
slightly aquiver, shot far out. Only the
trained eye of a savage would have detected
a fish swimming there, only a trained arm
could have swung the spear so certainly.
The man calmly waited while the big bream,
sivimming frantically, but ever bearing over,
swam its life out in the coral-bound pool.
Up rose the wooden haft: up, up; over
the long haft leaned; now the white of the
fish’s belly showed ; it was swimming in ever-
narrowing circles on its side. The man
watched the struggle. Time did not count.
And the quiet satisfaction of the necessary
meat for the day was his. Finally, plunging
in, he brought the still impaled fish out on
to the reef.
Collecting the lobster and walking leisurely
back, the turning of the tide washed across
his feet. Some distance out floated a some-
thing on the incoming -water. The man
watched it curiously, walking quietly on;
then he stopped. What was it? Not a box
from some passed ship of the sea. Not a
clump of seaweed. The skin of some native-
killed animal, was it? No! .Tust what was
it?
He sat on the sand, waiting. The sea-
motlier brings strange gifts to her nomads
of the Barrier seas.
With the ever-strengthening ripples of the
gathering tide the something floated a little
faster, then bobbed over the lip of the reef
into shallow water.
The man, purposely delaying to satisfy his
whetted curiosity, threw his warmth-loving
arms to the glorious kiss of the sun. stretched
luxuriously, then splashed out across the
reef. A quick breath grasped his throat.
The something was so big he had not dreamt
it could possibly be that. With a curious

THE PENALTY OF OVERWORK
Many People are Beginning to Feel the Strain
The heavy tax of overwork, the extra strain so
necessary to many trades and occupations, is hard
on the kidneys. The kidneys fail in their work
and the poisonous matter collects in the system.
If your work seems hard for you, if you have a
lame, weak or aching back, if you seem tired and
listless, if you notice sediment in the urine,
unnatural color, or irregular passages, and seem
to be running down without apparent cause, begin
at once with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, the
remedy that has proved so beneficial to your
neighbors. It has brought strength to the backs
of thousands of working men and women. Sydney
proof is given here.

A MAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. W. H. Trott, “Fairview,” Gannon Street, Tempe,
Sydney, says: “Off and on for years I suffered a good deal
from backache and kidney trouble. Sometimes my back used
to ache terribly, the pain being particularly severe when I
stooped. One day Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recom-
mended to me, so I bought some and they worked wonders.
After taking a few doses I felt much better, so I continued
with the treatment for a few weeks, and I am glad to say
they drove the pain out of my back and made me feel
splendid. Two years have elapsed since then, and I am still
free of backache, but I keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills by
me, and take a dose or so whenever I feel a little off color,
and they always do me good.”
Twelve years later, Mr. Trott says: “Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me of backache 14 years ago, and I am
still free from this trying complaint.”
TWO SYDNEY
PEOPLE
CURED OF
BACKACHE
AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mrs. Emily Osborne, 5 Queen Street, Petersham, Sydney,
says: “Some years ago I had a very bad attack of disordered
kidneys, and, as a result suffered agon y from backache and
rheumatic pains all over my body., I was often so bad that
I could hardly get about the house, evetyy movement giving me
increased pain. My rest at night was very disturbed, as it was
impossible for me to lie in one position for any length of time,
owing to the nagging pain in my back. My ankles and arms
swelled a good deal, and were very painful if I touched them.
I had no energy for anything, and was really far from well.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recommended to me, and
after taking a course of these grand Pills I was completely
cured.”
Ten years later, Mrs. Osborne says: “Ten years have
elapsed since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me, and I
am still well, a fact that speaks volumes for this splendid
remedy.” ,

eagerness, like a child that is afraid but yet
dazzled by the bare possibility, he quickened
his pace, then ran. He bent over the water
and gazed at the something. His eyes grew
very wide. 4 hen lie straightened suddenly,
threw back his head and laughed long and
wildly. The gulls wheeled a little faster in
their ceaseless flight. The man gripped the
something in two brown muscled arms,
swayed it above his head and dashed it into
the water, laughing* strangely with pure
excitement. Picking it up lie turned and
splashed rapidly to the shore, laughing face
ashine, never feeling the dragging weight.
Putting it down carefully lie examined it
eagerly. It was a big 1)1 ob of stuff, in color
a mottled black and grey, a squat, fatty-
looking substance, and in it were embedded
the beaks of cuttlefish.
“Ambergris! By heavens, ambergris!”
The gulls, now swooping low overhead,
wheeled yet faster and screamed in a chorus
ehnii moo
’ , (< .
. yr s : he shouted, ambergris. By heavens,
it weighs a hundred pounds. .Ml ambergris,
Its a fortune.
Stooping, he put sniffing nose to the
si range-looking stuff. He had once smelt that
unforgettable smell before. Quickly lie drew
the sheath-knife and scraped the blade
against the stuff. Then he laughed again as
lie had expected to. Along the knife-blade
the stuff clung like wax. Confidently he
pressed his thumbnail into the stuff. It re-
tained the impression of the nail. He rubbed
a corner of the stuff with the back of the
knife. It became smooth like soap.
T . , ~ ~ .. . n
Laughing in uncontrollable excitement he
grasped the big lump and half ran along the
shore back to the hut. Once more he shouted
up to the gulls Yes, ambergris Good stuff
and a great lump! A fortune!
At the hut he put it down carefully; then
ran up the nearest hill. From its grass-lined
summit he stared straight out over the sheet
of glass-like water. Miles away, its mains’l
flapping like a broken-winged o ull, lay an
almost becalmed lugger.
“It’s Thursday Island Coleman. I could
tell the cut of that craft if she was only
the size of a woman’s thimble. My luck’s ail
coming in one great lump. He mightn’t have
passed this way for two months.”
A signal beacon of dried bushes stood on
the summit. He struck a match. A sheet
of flame leaped from the sun-heated wood,
He tore down green branches and piled them
on in such a way that a long column of
black smoke rose steadily into the sky. He
laughed as he worked.
* * * *
Night cloaked tin; island in a sullen, wait-
ing calm. Beside the cheerful fire sat the
man, one brown hand fondling the ambergris,
He broke off a piece, a little niece, and pierc-
ing it with a splinter held it to the blaze,
It melted like sealing-wax and burnt with a
pale blue flame.
“Now we’ll sec what John Chinaman
says,” he smiled gleefully as he scraped a
little into a pannikin of boiling tea. The
stuff melted immediately. “John Chinaman
says him welly good amberglis,” he
chuckled. “First-class quality, weighs at
least a hundred pounds, and last time I heard
was worth £l2 an ounce. That’s over
£14.000!”
He stared seriously into the fire, then turned
his face slowly until his dream-clouded eyes
gazed towards the south. The fire burnt sul-
lenly into blackness. ♦
The man sighed almost w 7 earily and cupped
a slow hand under his chin.
“By heavens!” he whispered, “what gave
me that thought? A woman’s white shoul-
ders ! A good woman, too, with the breath
of Heaven upon her hair. Just one real
woman to spend the money on and make
happy, and the very best life that civilisa-
tion has to offer. And just those two nice
eyes as high as the stars above the rest,
and—-and I can realise it all, too.”
His hands clenched on the ambergris. He
laughed softly, then jumped up abruptly and
strode off through the night. “I'm going to
walk the beach and dream till dawn,” he
whispered. “Of all the sweet dreams I’ve
known on this little paradise, there’s been
none so happy as my waking ones to-night*”
Dawn broke. A swelling circle of molten
gold came straight up out of the east and
poised atop of the water. Then it leaped a
foot. You could swear that an unseen hand
was pushing that bright disc up out of the
liquid blackness. The sky shimmered into
waves of quicksilver. Below it a long,
broadening path of orange gold danced away
in vivid spreading sheaves upon the water.
The ball of fire climbed straight up. The
silver sky melted into a fan of leaping red.
A bird called among the trees. A mate
sleepily answered. A fish plopped in the
dark water. Then long, crimson rays darted
straight forward and tipped the white coral
reef in bands of growing scarlet. The sky
lightened across all the universe. A sheen
glinted From the palm branches. The dawn
had come.
“It’s going to be a scorcher.” said the
man with folded arms on the beach. “Cole-
man won’t reach here to-day at this rate.
I wish the calm would break.”
The palm-leaves sighed lingeringly, rattled
musically. A cool breeze kissed the man’s
face. He laughed in quiet delight.
“Nothing can go wrong. See, there’s a
white horse! And there’s another and an-
other!” He walked quickly up the hill. A
long way out, right under the sun, a lugger
stood into the island, its crimson mains’l
no larger than the puffed breast of a gull.
“She’ll be no time with this breeze,” said
the man busily. “It’s growing stronger and
stronger every minute. I’ll have breakfast
for the sake of keeping my racing mind occu-
pied, collect my few duds and have every-
thing ready. By that time she will be close
in.”
He dawdled happily over breakfast. It
was luxurious to think that, though already
monarch of all he surveyed, he was now
about to set forth with a magic wand to con-
quer a new world.
Presently from the hut he could distin-
guish the lugger’s sail, still a long way off
but growing fast under a spanking breeze.
’‘l'll make sure she is heading for the
island,” he decided suddenly. “I’ll have
everything ready to hop into the dinghy.
Coleman wouldn’t like to be kept waiting.
It's dangerous near the reef for a lugger
when the tide is out. And it’s coming in
now 7!”
Gripping up the ambergris he strode down
to the beach and placed it on top of a boulder
well above high-water mark, then walked
quickly up the hill. At the summit the
breeze did not blow quite so strongly against
his face. Half an hour later it had com-
pletely died down. It left the helpless lugger
a few miles from the island, the sea a pool
of reflected light, the air hot and still.
The man gazed disappointedly. His bare
arm touched a granite rock. He drew his
arm away quickly.
“The rocks are as hot as fire,” he mur-
mured—“burn a man. I’ll keep the smoke
going, though ; I must do .so/artiiing."
The day passed slowly into sweltering
afternoon before a dinghy put off from the
lugger. They had nearly four miles to row.
As they came over the reef the man ran
down the hill on to the beach. He laughed
agreeably as the sweating blaekboys grinned
a greeting. The dinghy crunched on the
shells. Coleman stepped out, Wiping a
glistening brown brow.
“Goo’ day, Cap’n Kidd ! By hell, it's hot !
If there’s not a young hurricane inside of
tw 7 enty-four hours I’m a Dutchman. How-
are you doing? I thought at the least yon
must have been dying by the amount of
smoke you sent up. But you’ve got a million-
quid smile aboard. Doing well?"
“Wonderful! Ambergris !"
“What!”
Coleman looked quizzically at the excited
man whose grey eyes were shining so.
The beachcomber laughed amusedly. “It's
all right. I’m not barmy yet. But w T hat
price is ambergris?” He dwelt eagerly on
the reply.
“Fourteen pounds an ounce last time I
heard,” said Coleman with quick interest.
The beachcomber grasped his arm fiercely.
His eyes went wild.
“Come and —look!” he stuttered. “I've
got the —the biggest lump you’ve ever seen !
Washed ashore! And not out of Jonah’s
whale either. It -weighs a hundredweight.
A gift from the good old sea !”
“My God!” breathed Coleman. “Why.
that’s—that’s £16,000, man ! Are you sure?”
“Positive !”
Their feet crunched faster over the
shingles. The beachcomber laughed boister-
ously. Coleman was breathing hard.
“Where is it? At the hut?”
“No. I brought it down to the beach
when the breeze was blowing so as to be
ready to hop into the boat. Here it”
Coleman eagerly looked, stared; then a
quick catch stilled his breath as he glanced
sideways at the man.
The big granite boulder, its contained
heat almost a furnace in itself, even without
the pitiless rays of the sun pouring down
upon it, was covered with a fast-vanishing
film of sweet-smelling grease.
L. L. IDRIESS.
Witch’s Matins.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f~M y HE witch came to the carven door
In the early hours of day,
For every church must empty be
Before a witch can pray.
All cold and grey the churchyard stones,
The earthy mounds and grassed;
Yet dead men may have smelt a whiff
Of hawthorn as she passed.
A wand of light; fell from the wall,
Dav looked across and smiled;
For morning greets the black-browed witch
As well as Christian child.
Iler bare feet on the paven way,
Her brown hand on the door;
Her shadow like a wisp of cloud
Is blown across the lloor.
Tall candles on the altar stand
Unlit the dark night through,
A rat is gnawing at a book
Behind the squire's high pew:
She sees the stone font in the nave
With question in her eyes ;
For she is just a nameless maid
No parson would baptise.
She sees the busts of godly men,
A knight in marble sleep;
And in the hollow belfry-tower
She hears young swallows cheep;
While through the dank and mouldy church,
Alien from everything,
She wavers like a plume of light
Or spirit of the Spring.
She does not kneel nor turn a page;
But somehow 7 , as she stands,
One know 7 s God moving through the roof
To find her w 7 ith His hands.
And now she goes soft as she came—
A footprint on the floor
Outlined in dew, a flitting gown,
A finger at the door.
Silent the church will keep until,
As the bold sun grows higher,
Obedient rustics come to gape
At parson an’ th’ squire—
Parson, red-faced and long of lip,
His lady sour and thin,
Their poor dependent rich no doubt
In consciousness of sin.
And squire’s son, the moody lad.
Will yawn the sermon through.
Because the lanes are white with bloom
And summer skies are blue ;
And where the trout stream spans the dell
And iris rims the edge,
He sees a pair of dancing eyes
That beckon through the hedge.
For if the aisles demure have hid
The secret of the hours,
Where youth has been remains for youth
A memory of flowers.
