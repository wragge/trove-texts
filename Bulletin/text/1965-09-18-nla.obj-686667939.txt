Now is the time to lay-down
Coonawarra Estate Claret 1960
Few Australian wines have as much potential for age improve-
ment as those from Coonawarra, where the select wines are labelled
Coonawarra Estate.
Vintage 1960 Coonawarra Estate claret, currently on sale after
more than 5 years in the winegrowers’ cellarage, is one of the finest
in recent years. It becomes all the more valuable because, due to
severe frost, there will be no 1961, as that year’s wine did not reach
the particularly high standards set for the Coonawarra Estate label.
The 1960 Vintage remains unchanged in price despite its additional
value, and you are strongly advised to invest in supplies of this
claret while it is still available.

Until October, you can enjoy Philippine Air Lines service only from Manila on. On to Hong Kong.
On to Taipei. Even on to San Francisco (East from the East!). But from early October, the
East starts just eight miles out of Sydney. When PAL flies from Kingsford Smith Airport with
the finest jets aflight. The only way you get extra services like international cooking, not just
food. First-run, in-flight colour movies, not just magazines. Nine music channels (two stereo),
not only conversation. And to top it all Filipina-style personal attention a rare combina-
tion of Eastern manners, Spanish grace, and American savvy. All on the most modern fan jets
flying, giant DCB's, the smoothest yet. At no extra charge. So jet East best. All the way. With
PAL (that’s the one airline that services eight others and serves everyone who flies it!)

Sad a particularly good Press, more space

tralian politicians’ pronouncements on
foreign affairs.
I*
But there was one segment of his
seech which seemed to get overlooked.
Nixon, a Republican who has tended
i Australia to be identified with an
liberal US attitude, developed two
nes of argument that could be studied
ith advantage by Government spokes-
len in Australia.
He estimated that up to 80 per cent
jUS voters were solidly behind Presi-
*nt Johnson’s policy in Vietnam. But
je did not brush off the remaining 20
|er cent, just because many of those in
were part of the US intel-
Ktual community university pro-
essors and the like. He indicated that he
accepted their importance because they
were the opinion-formers. Their criticism
fed to meet with reasonable argument,
fhe type of reasonable argument to
jrhich they were susceptible,
t And he showed clearly that he, at
feast, accepted that freedom without
groceries was not the answer. As well as
tfeedom, a man had to have groceries.

M ‘The South has hospitals, schools,
pting communities, and other facili-
les > many provided through the help of
p US and others but much coming
f om their own efforts under some degree
P freedom.
‘The South Vietnamese have this as a
feason for not wanting the imposition of
Government from the North. The Viet-
cs>n g’s initial propaganda appealed to
r e South to join them and get a better
way of living. They do not make this
claim today because they cannot meet it.
North Vietnam has been and is one of
the world’s worst economic slums under
a totalitarian system.”
As a technical performance, it was
superb. Nixon spoke without a note, with
the only thing on the lecturn his watch.
He had had no sleep for over 24 hours.
Up In The Air
VText time we board a whispering T-jet
or find ourselves in good hands all
the way we will make a point of reading
the small print on the back of the ticket.
Dr Isabella de Rode Verschoor, who
lectures in air and space law at Holland’s
University of Utrecht, convinced us that
we should.
It probably will not satisfy our morbid
curiosity as to just who is liable and for
how much if we crash the law on air
travel, we gathered, is not only the pro-
vince of a limited number of specialists
but is complicated and becoming more so.
But it will please Dr de Rode
Verschoor, who was keen to talk about
why Australia should be more interested
in air law than in space law. However
advanced space law might sound it is
far from being “practical”, a word which
Dr de Rode Verschoor rather likes.
“For you aviation is so important,”
she said. “You have done much in the
past with people like Kingsford Smith
and your great distances should make
more people interested in air law. I
think you have only one expert on the
subject and that is Professor Richardson
at the Australian National University in
Canberra. I think it would be more
practical if you knew more about air law.
But everywhere I go I am asked about
space law.”
Here by arrangement with the Neth-
erlands Foreign Ministry, Dr de Rode
Verschoor hopes she can stir up some
interest with lectures to law students and
fellow academics in Sydney, Melbourne
and Canberra. We gained some idea of
how the jet age was changing the notions
of liability in air law when she explained
that, since communications had become
so important in the jet-age, with the
crowding of the traffic lanes the traffic
control centres as well as the airlines
themselves were often involved in legal
claims. Nor was air law limited only to
catastrophes involving the loss of human
life or injury. Wine-growers in France
have been claiming huge damages be-
cause the blast of jet-engines had alle-
gedly damaged the quality of their bur-
gundy grapes, poultry farmers in many
countries are still worried about the
effects on the laying habits of hens, there
are always housewives wondering who
will pay for shattered windows, and
weekend gardeners get upset when an
engine drops out of the skies on to their
lawns. All this, we felt, excited Dr de
Rode Verschoor far more than the legal
problems raised by space exploration.

P which apparently only can come
Vith an income of about 120,000 dol-
lars a year. One of the top 50 screen
Liters in Hollywood, whose names re-
vive in an endless circle from picture
jo picture, he has written “Around the
p/orld in 80 Days” (for which he won
kn Oscar), “The Big Knife”, from Clif-
Odets’ play, “Lilies of the Field”,
«nd adaptations of two Tennessee Wil-
liams playk, “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof”
ind “Summer and Smoke”.
I He is here to prepare a script for
he Adventures of Captain Cook”, a
to 15-million dollar production which
Till start shooting late next year with,
robably, a brand new star in the lead,
isked who he would have chosen, given
omplete freedom, Poe said “Burton,
inney, or Brando”, although he hinted
lat Brando wasn't the ideal choice after
hat last voyage picture”.
Til also be making a little picture
died ‘Alice Springs’ next year,” Mr Poe
ild us. “It’s based on a novel by Morris
est called ‘The Naked Country’, deal-
g with stockmen, cattlemen and Abo-
pgines... a kind of cowboy and Indians
king.”
We asked Mr Poe whether he agreed
pith the views of so many Hollywood
liters and directors that the writer
nd director should have the right of
nal approval on the production. “No.
hctures are made by committee. Direct-
P and writers often make a mistake
l they try to supervise productions.
i But up to final cut the writer in
•ollywood nowadays has all the free-
)m in the world. TV has used up the
ibit-audience and each picture today is
distinct and separate product prepared
d staged like a Broadway show.”
A writer and director, if they wanted
f have final say on a picture, should,
f e thought, be prepared to work with-
r money and take a percentage of
p possible profits. “ ‘Lilies of the Field’
! as made for 246,000 dollars. My usual
would be half of that. But we
iade it because we wanted to. Much to
r SUr prise it took off and became a
■ success. But this is the type of
gamble you should be prepared to take
if you wanted to make a personal film.”
On “Alice Springs” Mr Poe said he
would have personal freedom, working
on a small budget and a percentage. On
“The Adventures of Captain Cook” he
would receive a fee and would sell all
rights of authorship to the studio when
he had completed the script.
How did he see the private Captain
Cook? “At first he seemed such a per-
fect man, so noble he made me feel
guilty and anxious. But after the first
month of research I discovered he did
have anxieties, neuroses and compul-
sions. I found out he was a fascinating
guy, self-educated and up from the
ranks. His private life? Just the sea.”
Wasn’t there a problem with telescop-
ing the narrative? “Well, a writer’s like
a computer. You have to feed all the
data into it and see what comes out.”
Beyond that Mr Poe would not go, feel-
ing that Cook would yield up more of
his character on a closer exploration of
the texts during the next few weeks.
When we left, the 120 thousand dollar-
a-year computer was ticking away hap-
pily, eagerly awaiting its next meal of
facts.
By Numbers
A committee established by the Ro-
man Catholic Archbishop of Mel-
bourne, Dr Simonds, is now a key
body in the education controversy in
Victoria. It is gathering, under the chair-
manship of Bishop Moran, the first full
facts and figures on the Catholic school
population of 145,000, including distribu-
tion, accommodation, class-teacher ratios
and other factors. The committee has
lay as well as clerical representatives.
Until it comes up with at least a pro-
visional report, the Victorian Govern-
ment and Victorian Teachers’ Union will
be in a difficult position. They will be
unable to assess the difficulties they
will face next year. The difficulties will
arise from Dr Simonds’ recent instruc-
tion that the intake classes at Catholic
primary schools are to be limited in
future to a maximum of 50 children.
Already 46,000 Catholics are in the
506,000 children at Victorian State
schools.
How many more will be given permis-
sion by their local priest to accept State
education in 1966? There are nearly 360
Catholic primary schools in Victoria. If
each sends an average of 10 children to
local State schools, this will add 3500 to
the normal intake. One rough estimate is
that this could cost the State an addi-
tional £300,000 and call for at least
90 more teachers. How the State system
in its present condition can adapt to
this so suddenly, no one has any idea.
Subscribers
goME readers, who took advantage
of our recent special subscrip-
tion offer, may find there is some de-
lay over their first subscription copy.
We regret any inconvenience but
hope to have all new subscriptions
processed by the end of this week.
SUBSIDISING LITERATURE
Ml NIMMO'S motion, asking the Vic-
torian Assembly to vote £lOOO to-
wards the expense of publishing the
works of the late Marcus Clarke, brings
the relations between the State and
literature once more under consideration.
It is clearly enough seen that the object
of the motion is to obtain for Mrs Clarke
and her children recognition at the hands
of the Government. The question then
arises, is it the duty of Government to
subsidise directly or indirectly the pro-
ducer of literature? We shall not at
present go fully into the controversy. We
shall simply point out what appear to
be mistakes in principle, and mistakes in
reasoning, in a leading article in last
Saturday's "Daily Telegraph", supporting
the negative side of the discussion. The
fundamental error the writer of the article
falls into lies in his confounding a life of
letters with a life of idleness. We quote:
"Does anyone really suppose that the
maintaining of a few able and specially
gifted men in idleness is a legitimate
object for the levying taxation on the
people?"
The fact is that literature is as much
an industry as house-building, or printing.
It is not to stop writing that a pension is
given to a literary man, but to enable him
to go on writing. There is an appear-
ance of manliness in such articles as the
one we are considering. They ring with
independence. They are full of the com-
mercial spirit. But it is to keep com-
munities from entertaining this unwise
manliness that other States maintain, or
help to maintain great thinkers. —■

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Insane War
IN a letter on page 46 of this issue
Mr J. Moulik of the High Com-
mission of India criticises The Bul-
letin’s editorial comment in last
week’s issue on the weakness of India’s
i legal and moral position (as distinct
from the strength of its strategic and
defence position) in Kashmir. His case
is that Kashmir’s accession to India
| was legally valid under the lndepend-
| ence of India Act of 1947. This cannot
ibedoubteo The Bulletin, however,
was not referring to this but to India’s
repudiation of its agreement to hold
a plebiscite in Kashmir. Yet more im-
portantly at the moment, Mr Moulik’s
letter may be seen as further evidence
iof an excessive formalism that has
‘always marked India’s attitude to
Kashmir. Whatever were the formali-
ties in 1947 who can take seriously
a claim based on the decision of a
Hindu Maharajah to hand sovereignty
of a Muslim State over to India?
Further, if Kashmir is as democratic-
ally governed as Mr Moulik claims,
'how do we explain India’s imprison-
ment without trial of Sheikh Abdul-
lah, Kashmir’s Prime Minister from
1947 to 1953?
However, there is no point, at this
tragic moment in the sub-continent’s
history, in raking over past errors, and
certainly not by Australians who are
among India’s closest friends and ad-
fmirers. The point now is to stop the
I appalling fighting before India and
I Pakistan destroy each other for
; China’s advantage. The fullest possible
support throughout the world must
therefore be given to U Thant during
his mission in India this week. He
himself says he has “no illusions”, but
fjrom past indications neither Ayub
Khan nor L.al Bahadur Shastri appears
to be a megalomaniac; they are
obviously under great pressure from
within their own countries, but they
are certainly not impervious to inter-
national opinion. It may not be yet
too late to dissuade the two govern-
ments from their present suicidal
course, and bring them round to dis-
cussion under UN auspices. \
But it is as well, while attempting
to bring peace, to have a clear idea of
what may be a final solution of the
Kashmir dispute. In this context our
New Delhi correspondent’s article on
page 26 is worthy of careful consider-
ation. He points out that neither par-
tition nor a plebiscite would be accept-
able to both countries and he advocates
the formation of a unified sovereign
State of Kashmir with its territorial in-
tegrity and defence jointly guaranteed
by India and Pakistan. Such a solution
would enable India and Pakistan to
concentrate on economic development,
to ease their communal tensions, and
to plan a joint defence against China.
This may also seem, as the correspon-
dent points out, to be a Utopian vision
at the moment But without some such
long-range solution in mind, any cease-
fire may be temporary and another out-
break of the insane war still probable
The Federal Government’s recent
decision to increase the protection
given to locally produced crude oil
is in conflict with what must be the
two prongs of any national fuel policy:
the urgent need to find more crude oil
on this continent and to conserve the
small reserves already found. Who
will welcome the new protection? The
independent oil search companies will
not welcome it, since, although they
now have the prospect of getting high
prices for crude when they find it,
their main immediate need is not
higher prices but money or subsidies
with which to prosecute the search for
°il- The refining companies will not,
since they will now have to pay a
Using Up the Oil
high, uneconomical price for locai
crude, and therefore will be reluctan;
to increase their supply and push for
ward with more vigorous oil explora
tion, especially when overseas oil is
in over-supply. The only ones who
can unreservedly welcome the highei
guaranteed price will be the Union
Kern-AOG group and the AOG share-
holders. Yet from the point of view
of the national interest the protection
from which they will profit may also
involve using up priceless oil reserves
needed for defence,
So unwilling does the Government
appear to be to accept the need to
conserve oil reserves that, in tripling
the 25 per cent margin over the basic
price for locally produced crude oil re-
commended by the Tariff Board, it has
already speeded the flow of Moonie
oil towards the refineries after recent
stock-piling and set in train plans to
put oil from the second Queensland
field at Alton into consumption.
If we are to avoid the reckless using
up of our oil resources and encourage
greater exploration, what is needed now
more urgently than ever is — as Sir
Harold Raggat put it at the Economic
Forum in Melbourne last week — not
these higher prices for crude but bigger
subsidies and a re-examination of the
operative conditions for oil search
permits.
Aboriginal
Guerrillas?
A lthough an idea thrown up by two
experienced lieutenant - colonels
in the latest issue of the Australian
Army Journal — that Aborigines in
Northern Australia be recruited into
a para-military force to check on infil-
tration in this vulnerable area and to
counter attempted subversion — has
been promptly sat upon by the Govern-
ment it could well repay serious con-
sideration.
It is unquestionable that indigenous
inhabitants can bring invaluable and
distinctive skills to a military force
During World War II, for example
Aborigines were welcomed in the
Armed Forces and there are a number
serving now in various ranks. Papuans
and New Guineans also served in the
war, earning a magnificent record,
and they currently have their own
Pacific Island Regiment. Why then
f he present official reluctance to use
Aborigines?
The Minister for Defence asserted
simply that there is no infiltration in the
North. The Minister for the Army
said plainly that such a force was not
"contemplated” since the Army had
“no evidence that there has been infil-
tration or surveillance from the sea”.
But is either of them prepared to gua-
rantee that there will be none next
year, or in five years’ time?
The creation of a para-military force
of Aborigines would not be easy. It
would require imagination, patience,
wisdom and enthusiasm. But the idea
has much to recommend it and Dr
Forbes could at least look at it.

No Time for a Referendum
No redistribution
H. B. TURNER
JOHN McEWEN
By BRIAN JOHNS
The Federal Government will not hold a national referendum this year to
increase the numbers in the House of Representatives, and to remove the discrimina-
tion against Aborigines under Section 127 of the Constitution, which excludes them
from a census.
When the Prime Minister, Sir Robert
Menzies, told Parliament in April of the
Government’s plan to hold a referendum
to break the nexus between the numbers
in the Senate and House of Representa-
tives (currently required to be as near
as practicable twice those in the Upper
House), it was widely thought that the
referendum would be held this year.
And, although it was not announced
officially, at that stage the Government
in fact planned to hold the' referendum
in August this year.
It is not clear why this schedule was
changed, but recently the Government
asked the Commonwealth Electoral
Office to arrange for a referendum for
early December This was impossible.
Apart from the usual time needed for
the preparation of rolls, under the Con-
stitution the Commonwealth Electoral
Office needs at least three clear months’
notice to prepare for a referendum to
allow for the circulation of pamphlets
to 2,270,000 electors, canvassing any
arguments for and against the holding
of a referendum.
Apparently the Government has now
lost whatever sense of urgency it had
about the holding of the referendum and
it is not expected to be held in the early
months of next year. This has its own
important effect: it virtually ends any
chance of a redistribution before the
next Federal elections which have to be
held by April, 1967. There just would
not be enough time. The last redistribu-
tion took 10 months to complete and
the Commonwealth Electoral Office
would need an estimated five to six
months more to make its arrangements.
It was the arguments of New South
Wales and Queensland Liberals on the
urgent need to increase the numbers in
the House of Representatives which
helped to overcome the Prime Minister’s
well-known reluctance to involve the
Government in another referendum,
which have been notoriously difficult to
w * n - These Liberals argued then, and
are arguing now, that the increase in
the population alone is sufficient reason
f° r breaking the nexus. They point also
t 0 fact that since the Government
won office in 1949 the size of the
Ministry has increased by some 50 per
cent while the number of private mem-
bers has remained static; and they
believe that the present arbitrary limit on
Parliamentary numbers has the effect of
stultifying legitimate-growth by reducing
the turnover in all parties, making the
injection of new blood more difficult,
The possibility of a redistribution on
the current numbers in the House of
Representatives has been agitating soil
Federal members in recent weel
Despite an assurance by the PriiJ
Minister, when he announced the re[l
endurn in April, that there would bej
redistribution until the issue was I
solved, Liberals are concerned at |
prospect of going into the next electiof
on the current boundaries. But at I
time no practical alternative has bef
reached. It is understood that Cabiij
decided last week against moves for |
early redistribution.
But most gallmg of all to the Liberi
is that the present boundaries, as tl,
noted Labor historian Professor F. Crij
acknowledged earlier this year, ui
doubtedly favor Labor The growth |
population in the outer suburbs at tl
expense of the inner city areas has pn
duced a marked imbalance in electora
numbers, particularly in Victoria an
New South Wales. Ihe hub of tftj
problem is that because country electo

All ol which brings the issues <

Country Party and the Liberal Part
After the bitter debates going back
1962, the Country Party finally su
ceeded this year in getting through r
forms to the Electoral Act which Liber
backbencher Mr H. B. Turner describe
as its “blatant gerrymander”.
Pressurised on this, the Liberals aj

So far it has not been fully appre

about the way it would like to see I

increased. It certainly will not be mer|
a “Yes or No” vote on whether the nexf
should be broken. The “how” will baj

There have been disagreements in I
Liberal ranks as to how the referendt
questions concerning Aborigines shot
be framed. There are those who wot
be satisfied to see the discriminati
against Aborigines removed from t
Constitution, in particular in the mat
of the census. Others want to see chan;
which would give the Commonweal,

is whether Sir Robert is leaving [

WOOL
The Hillbillies
On top of Kosciusko
By ALAN REID
I Just as the ALP has its Right and Left wings, the Australian Country Party
las its sophisticated and hillbilly wings. Chairman of the Australian Wool Board, Sir
William Gunn, pointed this up last week. He also indicated the Country Party wing
|e favors and to which he spiritually belongs.
Sir William gave his views at a
Specially summoned Press conference.
He was highly critical of Liberal back-
benchers Messrs Hughes, Turner and
(Wentworth, NSW, and Gibbs and Killen,
rihld, whose names had been mentioned
ujn the Press as either questioning the
of, or seeking more information
!jibout, the Wool Reserve Price Scheme,
proposed by the Gunn-headed Wool
a loard. These backbench Parliamen-
arians, he complained, did not represent
“woolgrowing constituents. Some of them
(lid not own a sheep. As they did not
(epresent woolgrowing constituencies
irnd did not own a sheep they should
tl keep their mouths shut” and accept
tfle scheme uncritically as good for
r t lem, and good for the country.
I have heard some hillbilly arguments
u i my day, but if the degree of hill-
illyness is relative to the height above
, r ea level that one must have been
3( eveloped on the summit of Mount
Kosciusko.
J Sir William is an aspirant to enter
,je Federal Parliament. He is contesting
t ie Country Party pre-selection for
v laranoa, Queensland seat, currently
eld by Mr Wilfred (“Bill”) Brimble-
eombe, a Light Horse World War I
yeteran, who intends to retire from
■'public life at the next Federal elections,

f Sir William wins the pre-selection he
Appears certain to enter Parliament and
Me his seat as a supporter of the present
|buntry Party Leader, Mr John Mc-
P'en, who is the embodiment of the
sophisticated wing of the Party.
4 On the arguments Sir William Gunn
put forward as to why Liberal back-
'ipchers have no entitlement to have
ifjews on an issue that could affect
tlally the future of wool, Australia’s
tl°st important export income-earner,
ifcEwen is unqualified to administer the
iNffolio he administers or to seek and
fkercise an influence upon the great
Rational issues on which McEwen daily
t i ee ks to exercise an influence,
iOn Gqnn’s narrow approach Mc-
pWer >, whose Department deals with the
problems of many secondary industries,
I s to deal with them. Mc-
Ewen has never owned a factory nor
participated in industrial management.
McEwen is also unfitted to argue (as
he has argued for years) about shipping
services because he has never owned,
operated or captained a ship. He cannot
discuss foreign investment (which he has
been discussing for months) because he
is not (a) an investor, (b) foreign or
(c) a man who is handling foreign invest-
ment.
Hughes, one of the backbenchers
criticised by Gunn, obyiously had the
patent absurdity of the Gunn approach
in mind when he said last week that
Gunn’s handling of the Wool Reserve
Price Scheme issues was “not calculated
to do him (Gunn) or his cause any
good”. Hughes was relatively mild. He
could have gone much farther. He could
have reminded the woolgrowers that
Gunn’s handling of this issue was in
SIR WILLIAM GUNN
some ways reminiscent of his handling,
as graziers’ representative, of the 1956
Queensland shearers’ strike, when a stop-
page that should have ended within
days, or been prevented from ever hap-
pening, continued for crippling months.
Gunn’s approach on the Wool Reserve
Price Scheme issues has produced more
than a quarrel about its merits or
demerits. It has had its effect upon
Liberal-Country Party relationships in
the coalition Menzies Government that
has managed to keep inter-party tension
within tolerable limits during 16 years
occupancy of the Government benches.
Just as there has been Liberal resent-
ment against the intrusion of the Mc-
Ewen-inspired sophisticated section of
the Country Party into political areas
some Liberals viewed as exclusively
Liberal preserves (foreign investment,
industrial development, overall as distinct
from purely rural financial policies, and
the like), there has been resentment
within the hillbilly wing of the Country
Party against Liberal encroachment
upon what they consider exclusive
Country Party domains.
Gunn has been canvassed as a possible
successor in the CP leadership to Mc-
Ew 7 en who, now 65, has spoken of
political retirement more frequently over
recent years than he used to do. Though
the chairmanship of the Australian
Wool Board, which Gunn holds, is non-
political, Gunn’s tactics have tended to
turn the Wool Reserve Price Scheme
issue into a political issue, and the
scheme into a Country Party-sponsored
scheme which could be bad for the
scheme’s progress, but good politically
for Gunn.
Gunn undoubtedly has some appeal
for the hillbilly wing of the Country
Party. Even before his outburst last week
Country Party members from this wing
were taking the attitude, at joint Gov-
ernment parties’ meetings, that Liberals,
particularly Liberals from electorates
that were not formally regarded as being
woolgrowing electorates, had no right to
participate in the debate over the merits
or demerits of the Wool Price Scheme.
The Liberals and Country Party will
probably get over their present upsets
without serious consequences. They have
much at stake. The coalition Federal
Government, in the existence of which
they both have vested interests, is too
important to them to be overturned or
threatened with disintegration on a
single issue which, while important, is
unlikely to be regarded electorally as
vital.
But relations will not be the same
again for quite a while. The revelation
of the strength of the Country Party

enthusiastic support for Gunn’s proposi-

Liberals have murmured about his

because it has been the only political

are embarrassed by the inquiry’s vindica-
tion of his charges.
ARIFF
Alibi for Boyer?
Out of Albert Date
By J. C. HORSFALL
When in 1959 John McEwen, Minister for Trade, championed Richard
lover against the then Shell economist, Douglas Hocking, to step into Tariff Board
Kbel Albert Date’s shoes, he could hardly have expected Boyer to go walking
i Date’s contrary direction.
ib] But it happened last week when 42-
lliear-old ex-Oxford and RAAF Boyer, in
,al private Canberra address, bucked offi-
raial tariff policy as blatantly as Date
ower did. The question is whether Boyer,
le Date, will be thrown to the wolves
)tl» whether Mr McEwen himself will
novide an appropriate alibi. The pos-
ibility that the Minister put him up to
in cannot be dismissed.
Naturally, after his exposure of the
f overnment’s protectionist policy (as
by the Prime Minister, Sir
Vl obert Menzies, in his 1962 declaration),

I Jr McEwen as the Minister concerned
j ad to jump immediately into print to
u isavow the heresy of his protege. At the
# ictorian Chamber of Manufacturers
r Gnomic Forum in Melbourne, the day
fter Mr Boyer’s speech was reported,
r 4r Holt also had to depart from his
repared talk to lay the lie that the tariff
c 'ail was under threat!
On the other hand, as Country Party

would be a better choice than

Sr° has lately been roaming the world
N finding liberalisation of tariffs de
'p practically everywhere he went?
L 5011 of the late Sir Richard Boyer, the
■ ABC chief, would not be one to
mince words when the right moment
came.
Mr Boyer claimed that tariff policy
should be re-thought not only in the light
of world trends, but also to get a more
rationalised direction of economic
growth in Australia. In his view, the
long-held idea behind our tariff policy
that “if you make it we will protect it”
was out of date, he said. He said: “We
cannot disregard the moves towards
more liberal trading in some parts of
the world and particularly by countries
with broadly similar characteristics to
our own, at least we should ask why our
tariff policy seems to point one way,
while theirs points in the opposite direc-
tion.
“Again,” he continued, “some other
aspects of our traditional tariff policies
seem ripe for questioning, if only because
we are now living in a different world
to that which existed when they were
formulated.” Talking about using the
tariff to create secondary industry
employment, he said that in an economy
such as ours the tariff is in most cases
now one of the worst instruments to
use deliberately for the sake of the jobs
it can create, Australia’s labor was
expensive labor, and if the tariff was
used to encourage the development of
industries which provided the most jobs
it was encouraging the most expensive
type of production.
As capital-intensive industries were less
costly for Australia, in his view there
was no need to encourage those indus-
tries which provided the most employ-
ment. There were more than enough
worthwhile projects “screaming to be
done” by an already over-stretched and
highly paid work force, he said. Current
difficulties in expanding manufactured
exports were mostly a legacy of a tariff
build-up which had produced a high
cost economy.
Mr Boyer appeared to be under no
illusion that revolutionising tariff policy
would be easy, for, although he claimed
that the Tariff Board realised this should
happen, unfortunately the community
seemed to be quite satisfied with things
as they are.
WATERFRONT
The Ageing
Wharfies
End of an era
The Melbourne branch of the Water-
side Workers’ Federation is once again
the focus of attention from all over Aus-
tralia, for it is here that the Moscow-
Peking struggle is most bitter and most
exposed.
Communist secretary Charlie Young,
who died last week, had not been at
his duties for several months. The
Moscow-line Communists are fearful
at the prospect of a special election at
this stage, and exerted every pressure on
Young to hang on to his office, despite
his decreasing capacity
Young held the office since 1954,
when a special election was held, follow-
ing the discovery that there were serious
discrepancies in the financial accounts
of the branch. His predecessor, Bert
Clarke, was subsequently found to have
lost about £lO,OOO of union funds
through backing slow horses. Clarke’s
career was a tragedy. He was one of the
ablest union officials to have emerged
from the Industrial Group machine. An
excellent speaker, and an official of
exceptional competence, he was widely
regarded, prior to his downfall, as the
logical successor to Jim Healy. His vic-
tory margins over his opponent. Young,
were 3 and 4 to 1, but together with
his ability he had the fatal flaw of
being a compulsive gambler, and Young
got an armchair ride into the position.
It wasn't until 1955, however, that the
Communists, together with the Unity-
Ticket Labor men, achieved a clean
sweep on the executive and one of
the new officials was assistant secretary
David Bearlin, then a member of the
Communist Party.
The present unrest and turmoil on the
Melbourne waterfront can be seen
primarily as a stage where the two Com-
munist parties are jockeying for advan-
tage in preparation for the struggle
for the secretary’s position.
At the moment the Peking group is
in the leading position. Their leader,
assistant secretary of the branch Ted
Bull, won a tremendous victory at the
last election, defeating his rival, Moscow

cil they have the game so sewn up that
their might usually prevails without a
show of strength. The periodical skir-
mishes that do occur are more often than
not just an opportunity for the unions
to flex their muscles. For every dispute
that does end up in a clash, there are
dozens that are settled amicably by the
tried and proven round-table negotiations
method.
While the merit of the system is a
matter of opinion, statistics do tend to
show that it has outstripped arbitration
when it comes to mining matters. From
1922 to 1963, only 741,000 man-shifts
were lost on the whole line of lode in
Broken Hill through stoppages, most of
them only one-day affairs. On paper,
that may seem to be a big loss, but when
compared with figures for other mining
centres it is shown to be significantly
low. From 1922 to 1952, for instance
(with arbitration outlawed), there were
56 stoppages, causing a loss of 584,964
man-shifts. Whereas in the NSW coal
mines from only 1930 to 1951 there dy
9,645 stoppages, inflicting a lossf
9,569,352 man-shifts.
One of the pioneers of the system,!
late Andrew Fairweather, chairman
the Mining Managers’ Association in |
late 1930 s and early 19405, once rem;i
ed after there was talk of altering
set-up: “I do think our method of dl (
ing with industrial disputes is proba! l
better than the method adopted by n ! *
employers, because it is a method whf
forces us together, and it is a strai g
thing that no matter how much mu
opinions may differ, they tend to cos
together by personal contact.”
The present chairman of the MM
Mr W. E. Fitzpatrick, said earlier t
year that “employers and employees
Broken Hill have reached a high degij
of maturity in their industrial relation
More recently the president of the B 1
Mr W. S. O’Neil, claimed that “if t
wharfies and ship owners would get
the conference table like us they won-
settle most of their problems”.

NEW GUINEA
The Longest Assembly
Dodging the showdowns
By EDWARD WOLFERS
The recently concluded session of the Papua and New Guinea House of As-
ienibly was not only the longest to date (nine sitting days) but it was in many ways
he most important, not so much in terms of the actual legislation passed as in terms
,fthe attitudes it evoked among the Members and the showdowns that were avoided.
For the first time there was the possi-
bly of strong conflict between the
jouse and the Australian Government
)n a matter of principle involving the
iery power and status of the House it-
elf, The Australian Government advised
the Administrator to withhold assent
rom a Bill amending the Public Service
finance and establishing a Public Ser-
vice Board for the Territory. What began
I a strong attack on the Australian
government by lan Downs on August
ii degenerated towards the end of the
debate into a series of apologies, as a
piumber of indigenous members rose to
iiidmit to the faults of the Bill and almost
;;o thank the Australian Government for
renting them out to the House.
While there was hesitation over the
% issues and a tendency for the Euro-
|:an members to dominate each debate,
ere was a definite sense of participation
parent during the debates on the Gam-
g (Playing Cards) Bill, the Local Gov-
ament Bill, and the Birds of Paradise
(ill.
The tone of the debates on these mea-
fres was predominantly a “moral” one
pd unlike the Budget debate they con-
ned every member of the House,
ivery electorate has a gambling problem
nd here was something tangible that
3 Wd be done. The Bill was passed, dec-
id
laring card-playing to be totally illegal
except on licensed premises or with
cards obtained from such places. The
Local Government Bill was lost, but the
debate was again a very “moral” one, as
was the debate on the Tax Bill when Mr
Downs pointed out that the new income
tax rating would hit European residents
hardest; the indigenous members sym-
pathetically agreed.
Tensions within the House seemed to
come to a head when, after violent pro-
test at the proposed new tariffs on rice,
flour, meat and fish in the Budget, the
official members made a deal with six
of the elected members that these new
imposts be replaced by an increase in
the proposed additions to the duties on
beer from 1/- to 2/- per gallon. A num-
ber of members, especially Europeans,
attacked the deal.
John Guise’s motion that all Bills pro-
posing changes in the Constitution of the
Territory be first examined and recom-
mended upon by the Select Committee
on Constitutional Development was
a fairly obvious attack upon those who
wish to force the pace of political devel-
opment or to seize the initiative from
the established leaders of the House. The
motion was quite clearly aimed against
the Parliamentary Executive (Interim Pro-
visions) Bill introduced by Mr Barry
Holloway, and adjourned until the next
meeting of the House to allow sufficient
time for full discussion of its proposal
for a quasi-ministerial system of gov-
ernment for the Territory. Dr Gunther
even hinted that the Bill might not be
legal under the terms of the Papua and
New Guinea Act.
The debate on the Birds of Paradise
Bill was a disappointment. Almost every-
one congratulated Mr Gabriel Ehava
Karava on his sincere attempt to draw
attention to the plight of his electorate,
but most members agreed the Bill should
not be passed. Mr Singin Pasom gave one
of the finest speeches yet heard in the
House, when he described the bird and
told, in Pidgin, how the elders of his
village had hunted it. For a brief time
the debate belonged to the New Guinea
of the villages.
Another notable speech on the second
last day of the sitting was that of Mr Ron
Neville who, in a low-keyed, sympathetic
manner, outlined the problems faced by
the indigenous members of the House
in understanding the complexities of
Standing Orders and of many of the Bills
that came before the House without
being translated into either Pidgin Eng-
lish or Motu. Some members saw this
speech as an attack upon their intelli-
gence.
The main “positive” measure in this
session was probably the tabling of a
statement outlining the Territory’s new
Development Bank and the granting of
£lOO,OOO to get it started.

VATICAN IV
Preparing for the third millennium
From DESMOND O’GRADY in Rome
Will the Ecumenical Council, whose fourth and final session begins this week, end with an ecumenical
bang or a whimper of overworked bishops? The three preceding Council sessions completed the examina-
tion of only five subjects* but this session proposes to get through 11. Although much preliminary work
has been done in previous sessions, it is still a daunting work-load for the bishops who hope to be home
for Christmas.
According to “L’Osservatore Romano”,
le 11 drafts to be considered fall into
iree categories: (1) there will be full
iscussion of the new texts on religious
terty, the Church and the modern
orld, the missions, and the life and
linistry of priests; (2) there will be
Mae discussion of the amended divine
Relation and lay apostolate drafts; (3)
here will be voting without discussion
fn the remaining drafts, namely re-
tons with non-Christian religions (“the
(ewish declaration”), renovation of
religious life, formation of priests,
Christian education, and the pastoral
Junctions of bishops.
! No sooner had “L'Osservatore” pub-
phed its classification of the conciliar
programme than the authoritative French
Jesuit monthly “Etudes” contradicted it,
laying that the amendments to the lay
pstolate draft since the previous
ession are so extensive that it is vir-
lally a new text which should be fully
iscussed. It further claimed that two
■ the five texts “L’Osservatore” classed
1 merely for voting were likewise new
■tough to warrant discussion.
There is uncertainty therefore even
pout the status of the texts to be con-
[dered in the fourth Council session and
r s in turn will affect the duration of
P e session for which no closing date
ias been set. The small group of re-
ftonaries who have tenaciously op-
losed the concilar majority will con-
tinue their delaying tactics, hoping that
the frustrated assembly will pass weak-
ened texts and refer others to control-
lable post-conciliar commissions. The
majority are likely to suffer from ennui,
because the work will be intense and
tiresome, and from impatience to end
discussion so they can put the conciliar
decisions into effect.
The lengthiest debate is likely to take
place over the Church and the modern
world text. The second half of the text
considers questions such as the inter-
national community and peace, the
economic, political and social orders,
marriage and the family. The chapter
on marriage avoids consideration of
birth control while awaiting Pope Paul's
pronouncement on the question which
has been studied by a Papal commis-
sion; the chapters on the economic,
social and political orders repeat much
of Pope John's encyclicals “Pacem in
Terris” and “Mater et Magistra”; but
that on peace and the international com-
munity breaks new ground.
It argues with a passionate concern
that international and intranational re-
lations of all forms should be revised
in order to achieve peace. Christians, it
maintains, should not only form a pub-
lic opinion which presses for internation-
al agreements excluding war but should
promote the reorganisation of economic
and social structures necessary for peace,
and give until it hurts to help the de-
veloping nations.
It calls total war a “crime against God
and man” and the balance of terror
“absolutely monstrous”. Although the
possession of modern arms is not il-
legitimate until there is a public authority
with effective power to ensure world
peace, says the draft, these weapons are
morally unacceptable in themselves and
everything should be done to ensure their
eventual total elimination. In the mean-
time, the production and stockpiling of
armaments should be limited by inter-
national treaties.
Finally, the chapter on peace supports
conscientious objection which is re-
garded as illegal in most Catholic coun-
tries.
Only this chapter, which conveys the
urgency of the problem it considers and
affronts it with audacity, fulfils the hopes
raised by the first half of the text. Al-
though wordy, this first section on “the
Church and the human condition” marks
a clean break with the tradition of stern
reprimands to an errant world. It under-
lines the Church’s solidarity with
humanity and its history while showing
a concern for man’s concrete problems
in Pope John's spirit of serene optimism.
A conclusion admits that the consid-
eration of specific questions is rather
general but claims the principles laid
down can be applied to concrete circum-
stances. Among the principles it as-

sumes is that of religious liberty, which
is to be considered in the fourth session.
Although moves will be made by the
minority to obstruct it as in the third
session, it seems certain that the Council
will recognise that every man has the
right to form and follow his beliefs with-
out undue pressure from others.
“The Jewish Declaration” should like-
wise be passed despite the opposition of
a determined minority. Basically it has
already been accepted; in its reworked
form the other non-Christian religions,
and particularly Islam, have received
considerable attention so that it is no
longer solely a denunciation of anti-
Semitism and a reconsideration of re-
lations with the Jews.
The draft on the function of bishops
could prove crucial to the success of the
Council as a whole. The creation of a
Senate of Bishops to assist the Pope in
the direction of the Church hinges on the
proposals in this draft and a corollary
of the Senate is a reform of the Roman
curia. A Senate of Bishops to assist the
Pope seems a necessary expression of
the doctrine of collegiality already pro-
claimed by the Council. This Senate’s
administration would be a more inter-
national, reshaped curia which did not
pretend to have all the answers when it
does not know the questions.
One of the tensions of the fourth
session will centre around this Senate
and curial reform: Will the Pope an-
nounce his intention to implement them
or not before the bishops disperse? If
not, there is little likelihood that they
will be introduced. But even if they
are announced, what will be their con-
tent?
It seems likely that the College of
Cardinals will be enlarged and diversified
to function as a Senate, but most pro-
gressive bishops will not be satisfied un-
less bishops representing regional epis-
copal conferences have a voice in this
Senate. The Pope’s advisers would then
include bishops who could speak in the
name, for instance, of 600 Latin-Ameri-
can bishops.
Radical reorganisation
jy'o doubt there will be some reform if
the curia some time. It has been rec-
ognised many times but now there is a
demand for a radical reorganisation so
that the curia, which to a large extent
has opposed the Council, should whole-
heartedly implement it.
The awareness and needs of the
worldwide Church have, through the
Council, exerted great pressure on Rome
for structural changes. It is not aC all
clear how far Pope Paul will move to
meet these demands. So far approach
has been gradualist and he leant over
backwards to placate the vociferous
minority who oppose any change.
There is no more pathetic figure than
the absolute monarch who thinks he can
come to terms with the Social Demo-
crats and ends up shooting striking
workers. Some consider Pope Paul too
deeply influenced by the reactionary ad-
visers of his court. Certainly it could
have been demagogic to try to imitate
Pope John but the Roman tradition of
accepting proposals only to empty them
of their content and of leaving in-
adequate officials to fill important posts
while hoping for their early death is
foolhardy when there is a widespread
demand for reforms to answer new neei
Pope Paul has had a most diffio
role because he came to power when |
Council was under way. If he had est
lished a strong personality as Pope
could have been taken as an attempt
determine the course of the Coum
Moreover, while Pope John opened n
vistas it remained for Paul to make i
concrete decisions and compromises
pass from principle to practice and th
never satisfy everyone.
It is doubtful if John would havei
patiently gathered evidence from
mixed birth-control commission as ll
Paul; Paul VI is pursuing a hard-heai
but open-minded policy in developii
relations between the Vatican and tl
Eastern European countries; a numbe
ol Eastern bishops find he has a betti
understanding of concrete ecumenic
gestures than lohn.
The Pope could well remain an en-
igmatic figure after the Council, as ll
does not enjoy John's exceptional abilitl
to communicate and, in what will be
leng period of often painful transforn
ations, he is likely to remain pre-occi
pied by the difficulties of keeping tl
Church together But while the Pope
decisions can hasten or delay mattei
the emergence of the post - concili.
Church is inevitable.
This will become apparent during tl
fourth session, lor the drafts are assui
ing principles which are proposed
other conciliar drafts. The Missio
text, for instance, assumes that religio
liberty is recognised by the Church ai
that the Church has entered the age
dialogue. E is based on the concepti
of the Church as a missionary coi
munity endorsed in the decree on t
nature of the Church passed in the th
session. Only in the fourth session '
it become apparent that the Council
not passing an isolated series of do
ments but a whole interconnected b(
of teaching which was unimagina
only five years ago.
This does not merely bring the Chur
up-to-date for 1965. The draft on
Church and the modern world proje
it into the future and will prepare
Church for the third millennium. 1
extent of the change involved is not <
fully realised but the reason for it is l
Church’s discovery of the world. "I
Church’s organisational, spiritual and
tellectual structures have been shah
by a new awareness of the dimensu
of mankind’s problems. The effects <
be seen in the revival of theologi
activity as in the establishment of r
Vatican organs such as the secretarii
for relations with other Christian boc>
with non-Christian religions, and u
non-believers. I
The guidelines for renewal willl 1
clear after the fourth session. )

STOP THEM FROM SUICIDE
The insane war of India and Pakistan
From a Correspondent in New Delhi
Are nations, like individuals, sometimes driven by an inner compulsion, which Freudians call the death
instinct to commit collective suicide? How else is one to understand the heart-breaking developments in the
Indian sub-continent during the last few weeks? No one in his senses would fail to see that an all-out war
between India and Pakistan means complete and irremediable disaster to both. Yet except for a formal
declaration, the two States are now engaged in what may shortly become a war of total annihilation.
One most horrible aspect of this con-
flict is that by its very nature it cannot
be contained for long within military
bounds. There are about 50 million
Muslims in India and 10 million Hindus
in Pakistan. A war between the two
States would almost inevitably precipi-
tate internal communal wars in both on
a scale that may very well eclipse the
casualties on the fronts. Should this
happen, the sub-continent may never
recover from the holocaust, certainly not
in the next few generations.
There is another, even more frightful,
risk. While almost all the big and smalt
powers in the world are anxiously look-
ing for peaceful ways to bring the two
countries to their senses before they
reach the point of no return, Red China
is openly engaged in deepening the con-
flict which very well serves its ambition
of bringing a ruined Asia under its
control. China is already in occupation
of part of Kashmir, and it is reported
that at least some Pakistani guerrilla
bands now operating in Kashmir were
trained by Chinese Communists. China
has already invaded India once, several
hundred thousand Chinese troops are
poised on India’s northern border, and
the present conflict may, at any moment,
provide the occasion for a second attack
on India, on a much more massive scale,
on the pretext of helping Pakistan. This
is sure to force India to seek military
support from the US, and possibly the
USSR, and if the Sino-Pakistani attack
really begins to threaten India’s very
survival, it is unlikely that the Western
powers will remain uninvolved. That
will signal the beginning of the Third
World War.
It is futile at this stage to try to
apportion blame although from indepen-
dent reports it would seem that the cur-
rent escalation of the conflict is due in
the first instance to the massive armed
infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir
from Pakistan. U Thant’s report to the
Security Council based on information
from 45 UN military observers clearly
points out that armed Pakistani infiltra-
tors crossed the cease-fire line on August
5, the day the crisis blew up.
It was not very clear why so soon after
the recent Kutch agreement Pakistan
adopted this hazardous course, although
it did give its troops some initial military
advantage. But the Indian Army is much
bigger in size (approximately 825,000
regulars against Pakistan’s 220,000), and
in an all-out war Pakistan’s strategic
vulnerability is obvious. It is possible
that Pakistan has been egged on by
China, and is counting on the latter’s
military support and intervention. Be-
sides, Pakistan may have calculated on
large-scale uprisings in Kashmir. On the
other hand, the step may have been
originally conceived as only a limited
manoeuvre to revive the issue in the
Security Council.
However, Pakistan’s responsibility in
precipitating the present conflict would
hardly absolve India of its large share
of blame for the general situation which
is behind this conflict. Impartial
observers would agree with President
Ayub Khan that the Indian Government
was never sincerely “reconciled to the
establishment of an independent Pakistan
where Muslims could build a homeland
of their own”. Even in the face of the
grave threat from Communist China
India in the past has made little effort
to win Pakistan’s friendship in the com-
mon defence of the sub-continent. As
to Kashmir, while the first outbreak of
hostilities in that beautiful but unhappy
valley was due to armed invasion by
Pakistani tribesmen in 1947, it is also
true that since the cease-fire agreement
in January, 1949, India has repeatedly
resisted every effort to reach a compro-
mise settlement of the Kashmir problem.
Kashmir’s population is predominantly
Muslim, and it is patently absurd to
claim that the accession of its Hindu
Maharajah gave India sovereignty over
that border State. As early as April 21,
1948, the UN Security Council recom-
mended that a plebiscite be held to
determine the inhabitants’ preference be-
tween India and Pakistan. At first Mr
Nehru agreed to this, but in 1956 he
openly rejected the possibility, and since
then India has gone ahead unilaterally
to integrate Kashmir with the rest of
the Republic. The latest step in this
direction was taken this year which
might have provoked Pakistan to extreme
measures.
In the course of this attempt, India
has not only made Pakistan its bitterest
enemy, it has violated its democratic
professions by imprisoning without trial
Sheikh Abdullah, Kashmir’s Prime
Minister from 1947-53, and it has not
succeeded in achieving a stable demo-
cratic government in Kashmir. It has
embarrassed and even alienated many
among its friends and admirers in the
UN. Even those who recognise Kash-
mir’s strategic importance to India’s
defence against the threat from China
find it hard to swallow India’s contention
that a plebiscite in Kashmir would mean
repudiation of India’s commitment to
secular ideals, or that it would herald
the break-up of India. In fact, as one
of India’s most outstanding leaders, Jaya
Prakash Narayan, has pointed out: “The
assumption behind this silly argument is
that the States of India are held together
by force.”
In any case, three points about this
conflict are clear. The war, if allowed
to continue, would bring a victory to
neither. It would involve both in mass-
scale internal riots which would utterly
ruin the entire sub-continent. And if
China intervenes in the sub-continent,
that would precipitate a third world
war from the fearful consequences of
which no country is likely to escape.
The conflict, therefore, must be
stopped in the interests not only of India
and Pakistan but of mankind, beforj
it gets completely out of control. t
The first step, of course, is to ge
India and Pakistan to stop all fightinj
immediately and to withdraw all arme(

orces to the positions held by them
lefore August 5. This is what the
iecurity Council has already called upon
hem to do by its two unanimous resolu-
tions. Next, the UN observer force in
he Kashmir area has to be adequately
strengthened to ensure that the cease-
ire line is respected by both sides.
Thirdly, India’s friends in the UN and
the Commonwealth shall have to per-
vade its leaders that Kashmir remains
in open question which may not be
Lived unilaterally by India.
[ This last is a hard task particularly in
Lew of the threat to India’s northern
(borders from China and the present
fcollaboration between China and Paki-
stan. But India must realise that Kash-
nir will always remain the weakest spot
n India’s defence as long as India and
Pakistan continue to be enemies, and the
people of Kashmir are not given an
Opportunity to freely decide their destiny.
There seem to be three conceivable
p- alternatives: partition of Kashmir
ilong present lines (which, for good
reasons, is not acceptable to Pakistan);
[plebiscite under international auspices
jpposed by India); or formation of a
nified sovereign State of Kashmir with
is territorial integrity and defence jointly
luaranteed by India and Pakistan. From
very point of view, the third would
eem to be the most desirable alter-
ative.
But this would require a radical re-
rientation in the attitude and behavior
f India and Pakistan to each other.
Ine may suggest any number of reasons
jhy such a reorientation ought to take
! lace, although its chances at the
foment are admittedly slender. Friend-
ship between India and Pakistan will
ipllow both to devote their limited re-
sources to the pressing tasks of economic
ipelopment. It will also help them
to plan a joint defence against the ex-
pansionist totalitarianism of China. It
fill substantially contribute to easing
peir internal communal tensions and, in
;lhe case of India, it will greatly reduce
ithe danger of its democratic civilian
government being replaced by the
fnilitary, which may not be ruled out in
|ase of all-out war.
( In the context of the present critical
Station, this is still very much a utopian
ision of the future. The urgent need
0w is to prevent escalation, and to
thieve cease-fire on all fronts. Once
M is done there will be time to consider
i e °ext steps. Given the reprieve,
;an >ty may eventually reassert itself in
fhe two countries, and the vision may
f ot ihen seem as impossible of realisa-
10n as it certainly does in the present
nsane mood of collective suicide.

ON THE MARGIN
Read Any Good Titles Lately?
Tn the book trade books are not called
books, they are called titles. It is a
sensible custom. Not all of us have the
time or even the inclination to read
the latest books, but it is much easier to
keep up with the titles. By a little effort
one may acquire a working knowledge of
a large number, and become quite a good
judge of them.
The art of giving titles to books has
come a long way in the present century.
The old humdrum practice of naming a
novel after its principal character has
nearly died out. Few authors nowadays
would expect to get away with such
pitifully unimaginative titles as Tom
Jones, David Copperfield, or Anna
Karenina. The good modern fiction title
contains a vague hint of something inter-
esting, and possibly improper, to be found
in its pages, like Saturday Night and
Sunday Morning, or The Naked and the
Dead. The latter might have sold even
better if it had been called The Naked
and the Quick.
In the non-fiction or “general” field
there is still a place, of course, for the
plain no-nonsense title which tells what
the book is about. The British excel at
this kind of thing. For economy of words
and functional efficiency it would be
hard to beat the titles published by HM
Stationery Office in connection with
building. Some of my favorites are Con-
creting in Cold Weather, Laying Drain
Pipes, Dry Rot, and Smoky Chimneys. In
their stark vigor these could double for
works by Jean-Paul Sartre. His title
Dirty Hands has the same quality—HM
Stationery Office was probably furious
for not thinking of it first.
The titles in the British “Teach Your-
self” series show the effective brevity
that can be attained by the imperative
mood. They rap out terse commands to
Teach Yourself Arabic, or Calculus, or
whatever it may be. More or less by luck
this series happened on one of the most
thought-provoking titles of recent years
Teach Yourself Sex. At first this
sounds an extremely difficult assignment,
then one gets to speculating on ways and
means, and in no time the challenge be-
comes fascinating.
I have a special, perhaps perverse,
affection for off-putting titles. By these I
do not mean ones which are limited in
appeal by their technical character, such
as The Participle in Cicero. I mean titles
that go out of their way to discourage
people who might otherwise read the
book. A good one appeared just lately
The Dark Descent: Social Change and
Moral Responsibility in the Novels of
Joyce Cary. The word “tomorrow” in a
title is a reliable reader-repellent. Queens-
land Today and Tomorrow that kind
of thing.
In a different category are teasingly
obscure titles that excite curiosity. A neat
one is Too Late the Phalarope. Not many
people know what a phalarope is, and
even when they have found out (it’s a
South African bird) they don’t know
what the title means. Playwrights, who
are very title-conscious, produce some
clever teasers The Summer of the
Seventeenth Doll is one. As for A Street-
car Named Desire, that is the title that
has everything.
A new sub-class of teasers consists of
self-contradicting titles, like the German
novel The Eighth Day of the Week. Edna
O'Brien said in a novel that a character
was “ten months pregnant”; a book with
that name could well take off.
I belong to the unfortunate class of
persons who can think of titles but can-
not write books to fit them. While an air
navigation trainee I was struck by the
possibilities of the phrase “point of no
return”, but did nothing about it. Later
John P. Marquand put it on the front of
a best-seller.
If I ever get into Who’s Who In Aus-
tralia they put me in one edition years
ago by mistake, then dropped me when
they heard more details —if I should
come up for inclusion again I intend to
supply, with other information, a list of
the titles of my unwritten books. They
will cover a big field, including So Hot
the Dog (travels in the USA), The Man
in the Grey Flannel Singlet (robust tale
of rural workers), The Little Engine That
Couldn’t (poignant novel of marital
maladjustment), The Tenebrous Vortex:
Towards a Tentative Reassessment of D.
H. Lawrence’s Punctuation (a D.Litt.
thesis), Of Human Bandage (saga of
nursing life), Lust Is Just Around the
Corner (pornography), The 40 th of
November (secret service thriller), The
Plain Man’s Guide to Collecting Old
Masters, and oh, what’s the use.

AROUND MELBOURNE
Lady Chatterley Comes to Town
A fortune for Hollywood in Cinerama
¥>eing a good Victorian I have been
protected all my life from
dangerous influences-. All salacious
books have been kept out of my way.
Well, on September 3, 37 years after
publication, the first non-purified
copies of “Lady Chatterley’s Lover”
arrived in town. As I write this,
almost a week later, the police are
still trying to make up their minds
what to do —to prosecute or not ‘o
prosecute. Meantime, the copy bought
by the Vice Squad, presumably, is
being read by every fit male in the
Department.
Actually, getting a copy is down-
right difficult I had to declare I was
well beyond the age of puberty and
I would in no way reveal the name of
the bookseller. I took it home care-
fully wrapped in brown paper and
then I sat right through the night,
reading every line.
It was interesting. I mean nobody
had ever explained before what odd
people Lady Chatterley and Mellors
were, and that often the book was,
good fun. For example, did you know
that Lady Chatterley was “a soft,
ruddy, country-looking girl inclined
to freckles, with big blue eyes, and
curling brown hair, with a soft voice
and rather strong, female loins. She
was considered a little old-fashioned
and womanly”. On the other hand
Mellors had “pure, white, delicate
loins ... a red face, and red mous-
tache and distant eyes”.
The first surprise came when I dis-
covered that this really wasn’t a
society - working class love - affair.
Connie’s father was only an artist and
her mother a Fabian, intellectuals,
and not true Tatler Society at all!
Then we discover that Mellors one
time had a commission in the army
and he was a scholarship scholar.
“The game-keeper Mellors is a
curious kind of person. He might
almost be a gentleman.”
But then he would slip into a most
entertaining vernacular, far better than
anything ever done by Ena Sharpies.
“I niver meant nuthink” . . . or . . .
“appen ye’d better ’ave this key, an’
an mind fend t’bods some other
road”. “Bods” is Derbyshire for
“birds”.
However, for the innocent new-
comer to this kind of literature it was
fascinating to note how well Lawrence
wrote about loins, bellies and but-
tocks. Indeed it would be safe to
say he is the best buttocks writer in
the language. Could one give some
examples? Page 84: “. . . little jazz
girls with small-boy buttocks like two
collar studs”. P. 116: “The most
beautiful part of her was the long
sloping fall of the haunches from the
socket of the back and the slumberous
round stillness of the buttocks like
hillocks of sand”. P. 135: “She saw
in his bent head, the quick, quiet
hands, the crouching of his slender,
sensitive loins something patient and
withdrawn”. P. 224: “Softly he
stroked the silky slope of hei* loins
down, down between her soft warm
buttocks”. P. 227: “. . . soft, small,
unspeakable beauty of the touch of
the warm living buttocks”. P. 276:
“. . . then stooping again so that only
the full loins and buttocks were
offered in a kind of homage towards
him, repeating a wild obeisance”.
P. 278: “He stroked her tail with his
hand, long and subtly taking in the
globe-fullness. ‘Tha’s got such a nice
tail on thee,’ he said. ‘Tha’s got the
nicest arse of anybody. Tha’s got a
real, soft, sloping bottom on thee, as
a man loves in ’is guts. It’s a bottom
as could hold the world up, it is’.”
It’s a curse that we haven’t enough
space to really write a thesis on
Lawrence’s interest in this, but there’s
more good buttock-writing on pages
62, 111, 163, 223, 264, ~273, 274,
277, 283, 290, 311 and 324.
Quite the most marvellously
amusing scene in the book comes on
page 283. They weave forget-me-
knots together, he in her maiden-hair
and she in his man-hair. In some
more advanced era it will make a
fortune for Hollywood in Cinerama.
Yet one learns so many things
from Lawrence, particularly the
theme that without sex a woman is
unfulfilled, she becomes thin, and
wastes so regrettably away. With it
she ripens like a beautiful plum. In
her teens Connie used to set out for
the Continent, tramp through the
forests with sturdy, lusty, German
youths and sing wandervogel songs.
When she returned her father “could
plainly see she had had the love
experience”. Later she gets thin,
wastes away “and the longish slopes
of her haunches and her buttocks
had lost its gleam and its sense of
richness”. Her father then tells the
crippled Sir Clifford that it doesn't
suit Connie to be a demi-vierge. “She's
getting thin . . . angular. It’s not her
style. She’s not the pilchard sort of
little slip of a girl, she’s a bonny
Scotch trout.”
TTnder the guidance of Mellors Con-
nie blossoms once again, gains a
bottom that can hold the W'orld up
and, eventually, a child. The end is all
rather messy and terribly unfinished.
Mellors gets the sack and goes off to
work on a farm for 30s. a week. He
is still married to his slatternly Bertha
and needs a divorce. Connie’s in
London waiting for the arrival of her
baby and she, too, wants a divorce.
But Sir Clifford, hysterical, shocked,
refuses her one. So it is all terribly
unfinished. We would like to know
if the love affair is continued, whether
Mellors lived unashamedly on her
private fortune of £20,000 left by her
R.A. father, whether the baby is a
boy or girl.
Best of all could we have an
episode with Lady Chatterley and
Mellors calling on Mr Rylah, plead-
ing for better treatment of their
story? Can you imagine the scene?
Lady Chatterley now would be a nice
old thing of 71 and Mellors would
be a slim-loined old boy of about 85.

The Improbable
Australian
David Martin in the Promised Land
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
It has been quoted before but stands repetition: “David Martin is the most im-
probable Australian writer who ever existed if indeed he should now be classified
as an Australian writer” (the Melbourne critic A. A. Phillips, in “Meanjin” 1961).
There is no problem of classification
any longer, if indeed there was one in
1961. In his novel, “The Young Wife”,
published three years ago. David Martin
was sufficiently Australian to be able ;o
write of the problems of Greek migrants
in their new land; in “The Hero of Too”,
just published, he is so Aussie he can
compose folk ballads:
“They made him an outlaw when he
bailed up the store
Of a man who had grown rich on
the diggers’ hard-won ore . . .”
Improbable, yes, but he is very much
an Australian writer, a serious and per-
ceptive individual of that species. The
pretty mystery of David Martin is how
did he become one, in view of the facts
that he was in his mid-thirties and had
already published in Germany and Eng-
land before he arrived in Sydney for “a
short visit” in 1949?
David Martin of Melbourne was born
Ludwig Detsinyi in Budapest in the first
year of World War I. His father, a Hun-
garian Jew, was in the textile industry;
before that he had been a journalist.
His mother, a Rhinelander, died when he
was an infant. The family shifted to Ber-
lin where he and his twin brother, be-
tween whom there has always been a
deep friendship, were brought up as
typical middle-class Jews by their Rus-
sian-Jewish step-mother.
The brothers went to a progressive
northern boarding school. The love-hate
David bears for Germany began its tor-
tuous growth at that time: he and his
brother were bullied unmercifully at
school because they were Jews; they
were also something of dunces in formal
lessons, usually competing for bottom
place in the class. Yet, a poet and prose-
writer, German was his first tongue, the
language of his first sentences and songs;
his first published works were in German
and there is an obvious, if unannounced,
regret that he never adequately explored
what was his native tongue.
He says simply: “I still remember the
physical beauty of northern Germany,
the Baltic coast, the pine forests, but I
don’t know that I could ever return; the
memory of Germany is still a deep
pain.”
He left Germany as the shadow of
Nazism began to spread; he had been in-
fluenced by radical writers, as he calls
them still, such as Sinclair Lewis and
Jack London, and had belonged to Left-
wing Berlin youth groups.
There followed a year as a trainee
horticulturalist on the Zuider Zee, and a
dash across Germany to Hungary in the
wake of a girl. He didn’t capture the
girl but he did discover to his permanent
benefit the Hungarian and literary side
of the family. He left Hungary in 1936,
determined to be a poet and social re-
former, and worked on a collective farm
in Israel. This was the time of near civil-
DAVID MARTIN
war in Israel and the realisation came
“that I was not truly a Zionist”.
The formal English he had learnt at
school became spoken English when he
joined up with an American volunteer
unit as a first-aid man in the Spanish
Civil War. He was one of a group of
seven who went from Israel to support
the Republican side; only two survived.
He carried the injured, got himself
wounded and wrote a lot of German
poetry: “I do not apologise for my time
in Spain like some people today”.
By the time he left Spain those of his
family who were able had fled to Lon-
don of those who did not get away,
sixteen perished in the Nazi terror. “So
I joined my family in England and, be-
ing familiar with the language and lik-
ing the people, I did not feel much of
an exile. One afternoon I attended the
Albert Hall for the welcoming back
of the International Brigade and heard
a massed choir singing British folk-
songs. I was very much moved by the
simple beauty of the songs and im-
mediately went home and wrote my first
English poem. Since that time I have
written almost entirely in English.”
In 1940 he married an English girl,
a great-grand-daughter of Elizabeth Fry,
He worked as a radio monitor and sub-
editor for a while and then as literary
editor (“1 was really only a reviewer”)
for ‘"Reynolds News”. (J B. Priestley
later took this job.) His first book of
English verse. “Battlefields and Girls”,
appeared in 1942; his first book of short
stories, “The Shoes Men Walk In”, a
year after the war ended, and his first
novel, “Tiger Bay”, soon afterwards.
Although he was a member of the
Communist Party and remained so un-
til 1956 his early works suffered little
from the Party’s ideological demands. He
is a shrewd and precise writer within
limited social dimensions and has never
been much tempted by the gaucheries of
social realism. As the Soviet began erect-
ing its cold-war barricades in the ashes
of Central Europe, David Martin, now
a naturalised British subject, saile.d to
India as a “Daily Express” correspond-
ent. He arrived in Bombay the day
Gandhi w'as assassinated and was the
first Pressman to interview the murder-
er. A year later he decided to have a look
at Australia; his play “The Shepherd and
the Hunter” was performed in Sydney
not long before his arrival.
He remembers with manifest joy the
excitement of his discovery of Australia.
“I was delighted by the casual, relaxed,
and friendly people, by the absence of
Whiggery, by the warmth of the cli-
mate, by the very height of the sky.”
With a self-conscious smile he recalls
those first few years when he felt that,
of all the countries of the world, Aus-
tralia was the nearest to Utopia: “It
seemed to be a land where a man might
shake off self-consciousness; a land
where people were without neurosis and
self-pity.” He says that he has since
discovered that they often also lack pity
itself; and that there is a special kind of
neurosis which possesses the non-
neurotic.
In those early days he felt that here
it was possible for a writer to make more
direct contact with the people than he
could in England where creative writing
could somehow never escape the sieves
of the few thousand or less members
of the literary and intellectual estab-
lishments. In England he always had the
feeling, a strongly depressing feeling,!
that the reading public remembered more

of what the critics said about a work
than they retained of the work itself.
He is no longer so certain that there
is more direct contact between writer
and reader in Australia but is not fully
able to identify the reasons for his change
of view. My own notion is that he was
mistaken about the way in which the
local Communist cultural apparatus
greeted his appearance and his works.
For many years he had an apparently
'captive audience amongst what is now
sometimes referred to as the Old Left.
They appeared to respond enthusiastically
to his writings and billed him as a star
performer at their poetry readings, de-
bates (they used to call them symposia),
and other cultural front activities. It ap-
peared to me at the time that David
Martin believed this was communicating
with the people.
It is necessary, though perhaps a lit-
tle unkind, to say that, from my impres-
jsion of a couple of these functions or-
ganised by the literary Left, David Mar-
i'tin, although a man of greater humani-
tarian intelligence than most of the others
present, appeared sometimes to drift info
the crowd-pleasing response in question
and debate.
The temptation to tune oneself In to
the wave-length of the crowd is probably
an occupational hazard with writers who
are consciously anxious to communicate
with large audiences. In any case David
Martin is probably no longer troubled
by it since he broke free from the Com-
munist Party and its cultural machine,
which was always so eager to hear and
applaud, and ever so reluctant to listen
and devaluate.
He is now concerned with re-discover-
ing his new homeland: “At first I was
so excited by how high the sky was
that I did not see how small was the
city underneath.” He believes he has
i grown ready to explore some of the
of this Promised Land. “The
'Hero of Too” is a report on part of this
mission; a task of myth-deflation.
I But his chances of becoming a first-
date Australian writer are still heavily
jeopardised by the limits of his control
iof the language. Despite his striving for
wlarity and lyricism there is in both his
poetry and prose a rigidity almost cer-
tainly due to his moving to the English
language after being raised on the
Teutonic.
His other danger as a writer was best
revealed in a recent television interview
p which he said of his recent book: “I
bad a number of things to say about
Australia and wrote a novel in which to
sa y them.” Good novels are written in
all kinds of ways and for all sorts of
reasons but they are also written despite
s °me attitudes, attitudes like the above
Jvvftich, by the way, I take to be a tern-
porary lapse into the terminology of the
Old Left).
From myth-debunking we may soon
see David Martin turn to grander themes
in which the experiences of his Aus-
tralian present, and his too often pain-
ful past, may be fused. He agrees that
this is the Lucky Country but he is also
convinced that the luck is fast running
out. He is now convinced that Australia’s
only hope of survival is a policy of armed
neutrality in which we sever the Ameri-
can alliance and set immediately about
constructing a fortress Australia,
The sense of urgency he feels about
this is likely to heavily influence the
future writing of this most improbable
Australian.
Price for Good Value
By CHARLES HICHAM
One wasn’t surprised, looking at the
record, to find that Vincent Price
was the son of a candy executive;
not surprised either to see that he was
brilliantly educated: Yale, Nuremberg
and the Courtauld Institute of Art. Nor
that his training had been on the stage,
most notably in famous productions of
Shaw’s “Heartbreak House”, Patrick
Hamilton’s “Angel Street”, and “Victoria
Regina” as Prince Albert, to whom
he is said to have had in his youth a
striking resemblance,
His career in theatre and film has
ranged across a staggering area: he has
played opposite nearly every major star
at one time or another, encompassing
the broadcast melodrama (as the mur-
derous aristocrat in “Dragonwyck”, kil-
ling his wife by placing a rare flower

in her room which sucked the air away),
sophisticated comedy-drama (as the pre-
datory Shelby Carpenter in Preminger’s
“Laura” a memorable portrait of
flabby greed), sub-Shakespeare (as the
Duke of Clarence in “Tower of Lon-
don”), and a long series of horror films,
mostly directed by Roger Corman.
This is an actor, one feels, who seizes
greedily on every part, whether it’s m
Shaw or Shakespeare or, as in his latest
movie, a co-starring role with Frankie
Avalon in “Dr Goldfoot and the Bikini
Machine”. He plays each part with im-
mense relish, audibly smacking his lips,
spouting the most ludricous dialogue
with the air of a Barrymore in “Hamlet”.
The long, sophisticated face has the air
of a more genial Disney wolf’s in the
old “Red Riding Hood” cartoon: eager
to gobble up everything life has to offer,
undaunted by the grimmer aspects and
exhilarated to a completely youthful
extent by the brighter ones.
Even what was,
perhaps, his most
daunting experience
seems to have left
him untouched. “It
was while I was
making ‘Tower of
London’ (a kind of
‘cut - rate “Richard
III”’) with Basil
Rathbone as Rich-
ard and Boris Kar-
loff as the execu-
tioner,” Price said.
“The idea was
that I would become
drunk on wine and
they would push me
into the butt of
malmsey. Well, we’d
been drinking Coca-
Cola steadily for
heaven knows how
long and then I went into the barrel.
“I had to hang on to a rail below
water. Boris and Basil got on to the butt.
Then the lid stuck! They fetched the fire-
men and I could hear them outside mak-
ing a commotion, and I thought, ‘The
end has come . .
“I held my breath and held my
breath . . . and at last the axes got
through ... it took eight men to re-
lease me . . . and after that Boris gave
me a present. A case of Coca-Cola!”
Another awkward moment had come
when Price entered for the “64,000 Dol-
lar Question” on an American quiz pro-
gramme. “They asked me who was the
painter who worked on the Sistine ceil-
ing as well as Michelangelo? Well, of
course, it was very unfair and I didn’t
get it. I tied for the prize instead of win-
ning it outright . . .
“Then they told me the name . . ,;{
was the man who had painted the cover!
ing of the figures’ loins at a later datj
. . . you know, I always say I missel
64,000 dollars by a figleaf!”
More seriously, Price had keenly f e |
the loss of many performers who haf
starred with him on stage and screen, ani 1
who, to the audience, almost seemed life
members of the same actors’ club!
Charles Laughton, Peter Lorre, and Ce<P
ric Hardwicke, most notably. He told J
horrifying story of visiting Hardwicke i)
hospital and hearing screams in the nex]
room: they had been Laughton’s, dying
not far away. And at Peter Lorre’s fuj
eral there had been no one to delivei
the last oration; all Lorre’s friends had 1
predeceased him, so Price had to do it,
“Suddenly I felt terrified. All the people
I’d acted with were dying . . . But then
I felt all right again. I realised they had'

r On the morning of his arrival, the

ij of television cables and reporters, and the
Hevent yielded a wad of Press clippings
i for the International Wool Secretariat,
f which had thrown in a few hundred
pounds to get its Woolmark symbol a
ride on Emmerton’s all-wool tracksuit.
1 Only a handful of the millions who
admired Emmerton’s epic knew what
iwas really driving him on. The chapter
Tthat ended at the many-fingered signpost
fyafrove the rocks at Land’s End began
* more than two years ago when Bill
s Birmerton was talking to a Tasmanian
' MHR, J. R. Orchard, at the Com-
-1 mercial Travellers’ Association’s Club in
Launceston. Emmerton, who represented
Australia at the 1950 Empire Games,
is totted up 64,000 miles in 25
fears of running and holds world pro-
fessional records for a whole string of
distances from six miles to 485 miles,
Remarked to Orchard that his life’s ambi-
tion was to run from John-o’-Groats to
Land's End. Orchard, who has something
of a reputation for supporting causes,
jattached himself to this one, and before
long Emmerton was the subject of an
|“Emmerton for England” appeal.
( Since someone had to go with him,
Emmerton wanted it to be his trainer,
Percy Cerutty. Not only did Cerutty
know more about distance running than
Anyone else, but sports writers would
.follow the famous old man like flies,
[ensuring maximum publicity for the pro-
ject. Cerutty agreed to go if asked. But
‘the Tasmanian Government said no, and
, the committee formed to arrange things
those instead as trainer-manager-com-
>panion the secretary of the Builders’
laborers’ Union, a man known as
[ Speed” Morgan. Morgan had not had
ttuch to do with long-distance running
IF he had trained cyclists.
• Differences began to germinate be-
tween Emmerton and Morgan on the
Voyage, which started from Sydney in
1963. In Britain the differences
grew, mainly, according to Emmerton,
fecause of the severity of the training
that Morgan and the Tasmanian Agent-
jFieral in London, Mr Alf White, who
now entered the picture, demanded
°f him.
Emmerton went into the "Glasgow In-
firmary for eight days with ptomaine
poisoning caused by tinned food. On
being discharged, he was told by Morgan
and White that he would have to do 60
miles on each of three consecutive days to
prove his fitness to make the run—a
distance which, although on the road for
some 16 hours a day, he did not equal
at any time during his marathon, and not
the sort of thing a man would have much
chance of doing after emerging shakily
from more than a week in bed.
Nevertheless, Emmerton had a go, and
covered 54 miles before his legs gave out.
One swelled up because the muscles were
sprained. It was the collapse of both
Emmerton’s legs and the tour itself, for
the doctors forbade him to run again for
a month and Messrs White and Morgan
told him that before the end of that time
the money would have run out.
Not only did Emmerton have to slink
back to the Tasmanians who had put
up the cash for a run that did not even
start, but he was pursued by rumors that
he was lazy, refused to train and had
been whooping it up at night.
Emmerton, a salesman, knew the
answer to it all was to save up his own
£2OOO and go back to Britain to
make good. The flood of telegrams and
messages he has got since the run show
that he has succeeded or almost, for
although the Tasmanian Government sent
congratulations, there was nothing from
its London arm, Tasmania House.
Not that the news failed to get
through. When phoned for a comment,
the Agent-General spoke on the subject
for 20 minutes. “I was never happy
with Emmerton’s training,” he said. “We
worked it out that if he was going to
break the record he had to run 60 miles
a day in 12 hours. If he can’t do 60
miles a day when he’s training, how the
hell does he run for 14 days doing 60
miles a day to break the record? The
most I knew him to do was 30 miles.”
Meanwhile, as Emmerton’s morale
responds to the knowledge of his
achievement, students of the case are
seeking a rationale in the thought that
Emmerton got caught up in political
enmities that began in Australia’s
smallest State long before he started
practising for the run that took place
two years behind schedule.

OVERSEAS
No Kenyatta
For New Guinea?
The new party without a cause
From IAN MACPHEE in Port Moresby
The absence of a burning cause and the difficulty of communicating party policy
to the mass of the people threaten the life of Papua-New Guinea’s new political party
the New Guinea United National Party.
The party has many well-wishers
probably more than its organisers realise
and it may survive as an organ of
criticism of Government policy but it is
unlikely to succeed in its basic aim of
reaching all the people and being, for
some years at least, a truly national
party.
The founder of the United National
Party (UNP) is Mr Oala Oala-Rarua, a
native from Hanuabada, the closest
village to Port Moresby. In his early
thirties, he has had a successful career
in the public service and has been a
pioneer in the Territory’s infant trade
union movement. As the launching of
a political party would not have been
compatible with his public service duties,
Mr Oala-Rarua resigned from the Ad-
ministration.
Preparation of the party’s platform
(referred to by one of the organisers as
a “manifesto”) began several months
ago. Mr Jim Keefe of the Australian
Labor Party prepared a draft platform
but Mr Oala-Rarua rejected it and he
emphasises that the UNP has no affilia-
tions with any Australian political party.
He prepared the present “aims and
objects” of the UNP after consultations
with a number of Papuan and New
Guinean leaders. The party’s general
aims are these:
1. To promote a national conscious-
ness and unity, to safeguard vigil-
antly national interests and to raise
the people’s standards of living,
education, health and welfare.
2. The rapid development of Papua-
New Guinea to self-government.
3. Utmost encouragement of the
rapid economic development of
Papua-New Guinea in accordance
with the needs, and for the benefit,
of all its citizens.
The original aims included: “Im-
mediate establishment of responsibly
government,” and it had been hoped h
set a target date for the developmeJ
of self-government. But in the final draf}
this was omitted.
These aims have little, if anythin®!
with which any of the country’s admini;
strators and political leaders would dis-
agree. The only aim which might noi
be acceptable to some is that calling foj
self-government.
“Self-government”, within the meaning
of the platform, means internal self-
government but not Independence. The
Minister for Territories, Mr C. E,
Barnes, in common with most observers,
believes that Independence or complete
self-government is many years away but
established Government policy is that it
will be granted whenever the people
indicate they desire it. This is accepted 1
as the most practical approach by most
persons concerned about the future of
this country. (The change in policy of
the ALP has caused considerable per-
turbation amongst both races in the
Territory.)
The platform propounded by the UNP
is in accord with the views of a large
section of both racial communities that
no target date should be set for Indepen-
dence, but that a large measure of
autonomy from Canberra should be
granted soon and that the House of
Assembly have control over money raised
in the Territory. A probable date for
this measure would be 1968, the year of
the second elections for the House of
Assembly. It is in this regard that the
UNP could make its greatest contribu-
tion, for it will add another point ofj
pressure on the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment. I
The members of the House of As-
sembly are calling more frequently for
the control of internally raised revenue
and a strong body of public servict
opinion desires that overseas officers
salaries be paid direct by the Common-
wealth Government and not by the Ad-
ministration of Papua-New Guinea. It
may well be that the attitude of the
Commonwealth Government on thn
ppint will determine the destiny of th<
UNP (provided it has sufficient organisa-
tion to have any destiny at all). If !l
can organise itself sufficiently to advance
this part of its platform, then it could
claim a large share of the credit foi
whatever measure of local control n
introduced.
There is reason to believe that Can
berra may well be receptive to the idea,
and if Australian public servants in th«
Territory were paid from Canberr;
direct, one of the main objections ti
the House of Assembly having sole sa
over some of the money raised in tl
Territory would have been removed,
is quite probable, therefore, that futut

pressure from the House and public
servants would have brought about this
result but the UNP, if active in this
re gard, might claim credit, too.
Beyond this, however, it is hard to see
what early or striking success the UNP
can hope to have. Its aims are little
different from those of the Administra-
tion and, despite certain definite failures
0 n the part of the Administration, there
is only one matter of major significance
in which the faith in the Administration
of any section of the community has
been shaken the salaries of indigenous
members of the public service. But this
affects, directly, only one section of the
native community and would have no
place of importance in the views of the
mass.
So there is not the burning revolution-
ary cause which led Sukarno, Nehru and
Kenyatta to power and it is difficult to
see any part of the UNP’s platform
which is likely to capture the imagina-
tion of any more than a handful of
j Papuans and New Guineans.
Students to whom I have spoken, while

Concerned about Decimal Currency?
You need Data Processing
know what it really costs?
If you’re typical of thousands of Australian businessmen, you’re probably plagued by a
mass of routine accounting. Are you finding it increasingly difficult to keep deadlines for
statement despatch, payrolls, trading reports? Does your stock record system let you down
with costly stock run-outs? Will decimal conversion add to your difficulties? If paper-work
is your problem, there’s a timely solution—lßM Data Processing.
With your situation in mind, IBM has devised two specific plans. They put at your
immediate disposal all the benefits of data processing (without having to purchase the
equipment) at a surprisingly reasonable cost.
THE IBM RENTAL PLAN
installs Data Processing on your own premises at
rentals that run as low as £250 per month. This
small company system handles routine accounting
operations and provides the control and measure-
ment you need over the vital operations of your
business.
m

THE IBM DATA SERVICE CENTRE
provides data processing services to customers large
and small. Expert IBM staff will accept full respon-
sibility for prompt, accurate processing of your work,
or you may prefer to hire these facilities and process
your owh work. Fees are surprisingly reasonable, the
cost being based on actual facility usage or on block
time, weekly, daily even hourly.
What will this mean to your business? In one step, it
places you on a competitive footing with businesses
1
already using these modem methods. It eliminates
inaccuracy, delay and the high cost of manual
methods. It gives.you prompt trading results and.
informed control over trading operations. All this,
and more, at a controllable cost, with no capital
outlay.
The hiring charges are tax deductible.
One of these low-cost IBM Data Processing
plans could well, be the ideal solution to yotil
biggest business problems.

group, could lead to a premature call
for Independence to the ultimate detri-
ment of the Territory and of its relations
with Australia.
Assuming party funds are scrutinised
by Australian security men (a sound
assumption in view of the presence of
members of the newly formed Police
Special Branch at the public meeting
held by the party) and that undesirable
influences are checked, then the question
of party finance devolves upon respons-
ible persons and, as I have said, prospects
from these sources do not seem bright.
If this is so the UNP may not get on its
feet at all. The one hope for finance
may be from the Australian trade union
movement. Mr Oala-Rarua has made it
dear, however, that his party does not,
at present, have the support of the Ter-
ritory’s trade unions. If they do choose
f to support the UNP, their own contri-
butions would be negligible but they may
attract support from their Australian
j counterparts. This is one of the big
I question marks hanging over the UNP.
1 At a public meeting on Wednesday,
* September 1, Mr Oala-Rarua told
f approximately 80 persons (about 50 per
j cent European) of his aims in forming
j the UNP and, at the close of the meet-
j ing, his desire was formally ratified by
; a motion passed on a show of hands.
[Volunteers were then called for to pro-
vide a guiding committee to plan elec-
tions for a national executive. The call-
i ing for volunteers, rather than having
[nominations of persons approached be-
forehand, was not an auspicious begin-
! ning and the position was not improved
by a statement the following night in
‘•the House of Assembly where an Aus-
J tralian-elected member, Mr Frank Mar-
j tin, cast aspersions on the political and
! social reputations of five of the 10
I persons on the guiding committee. (He
j said it included “two Communists, two
homosexuals and a hopeless drunk”.) Mr
1 Martin did not name these persons and
j if he did not know from his own know-
I ledge that his accusations were correct,
i his action was hardly an exemplary one.
| (At the time of writing no challenge has
been issued to, and no withdrawal has
j been made by, Mr Martin, but these
j way well follow.)
“Flags can come later”
the public meeting Mr Oala-Rarua
said that, after travelling overseas (he
has been to Kenya, India and Geneva
this year and has made other trips in
j Previous years), he was satisfied that the
-Territory was ready for internal self-
| government. He stressed that the date
' °f its-coming depends on the will of the
People. He said that the Territory should
a be called “New Guinea” which is the
n ame by which it is known throughout
the world. “Flags and anthems can
come later.”
Most of the questions asked of Mr
Oala-Rarua were pertinent but he did
not answer them well. His sincerity was
never in doubt but he did not convey an
image of dynamic, forceful, confident,
leadership. He is more impressive to
talk to privately and, after having spoken
with him at some length on the party’s
aims the previous afternoon, I went to
the meeting with an expectation that a
positive and detailed platform would be
presented, especially in the fields of edu-
cation and economic development. This
was not forthcoming, and Mr Oala-
Rarua’s diffidence and inability to pro-
vide satisfactory answers failed to
capitalise on the interest aroused.
Another weakness was the propagation
of party policy. How is the UNP to visit
each village? Who is to do it? Mr Oala-
Rarua’s answer was: “All who believe in
the party.” But without a policy to fire
the imagination of the masses there will
be few “who believe in the party”. And
then how are these believers to reach the
villages? Can Administration employees
such as patrol officers tell the villagers
of the UNP? One native patrol officer
was genuinely concerned about this and
asked his question twice, neither time
receiving an answer.
The first aim in the more detailed
“manifesto” proposes the “enlargement
of the House of Assembly to at least 100
members- representing single member
constituencies”. This is in line with the
recommendations of- Sir Hugh Foot
(now Lord Caradon, British Ambassador
to the United Nations) when he headed
the UN Mission to the Territory in 1962,
the proposals of which led to the present
House of Assembly. It is generally
assumed that the reason the Australian
Government created about half that
number of seats was that it would enable
the more conservative Highlanders to
dominate the House. From the point of
view of the long-term future of this
country this has much to commend it,
but one can understand Mr Oala-Rarua’s
wanting to change the status quo. Under
the present system Mr Oala-Rarua will
almost certainly never be a member of
the House. He and his fellow Hanua-
badans believe that there should be an
electorate to cover villages in and around
Port Moresby and, in the event of there
being 100 electorates, this would very
probably come about. Even then there
would be no guarantee that Mr Oala-
Rarua would be elected for he has
opponents in other villages in the area
and would certainly be opposed at any
elections.
Nevertheless, his chances would be
infinitely better than they were at the
1964 elections when the Hanuabadans
were arbitrarily lumped together with
the tough, primitive, more populous
Goilala people from the Highlands of
Papua. As voting will, for many years,
be on clan lines and as the Hanuabadans
have few friends, the chances of Mr
Oala-Rarua entering the House while the
present system is preserved are negligible.
It must be galling for him to visit the
House and see the Goilala who defeated
him sleeping 90 per cent of the time the
House is in session.
This aspect of the platform which
may also succeed, for Australia may
have to bow to UN wishes to im-
plement Lord Caradon’s recommenda-
tions in 1968. But this will not, in itself,
provide cause enough to gain massive
support for the UNP.
Catching the imagination
HThe same comment is applicable to the
second aim in the platform under
the heading “Political”. This calls for
the abolition of the ten special electorates
reserved for Europeans. Their abolition
is also probable because of UN pressure.
Other aspects of the “political” plat-
form, while commendable, do not seem
to me to provide a cause likely to catch
the imagination of the people. They
include more visits by members of the
House and other New Guineans to Aus-
tralia and overseas; more visits by New
Guineans to various parts of their own
country; regular visits to New Guinea
by leaders of emerging nations. The
Commonwealth Government would be
well advised to implement these ideas to
a greater extent than at present and,
although this would take the ground
from under the party’s feet to a large
extent, the UNP could no doubt claim
enough credit to help soothe it through
its teething problems.
Under the heading “International” the
platform proposes that “the party un-
reservedly supports continuing close,
friendly relations with Australia, the
establishment of friendly relations with
neighboring territories and continuing
support for the United Nations and its
various agencies”. A serious omission : s
a detailed proposal as to the nature of
the Territory’s relationship to Australia.
There are still a great many people in
the Territory (of both races) who long
to see the two countries joined legally
after the date of self-determination. The
inclusion of a proposal of this sort in
the platform would certainly have pro-
vided a much more controversial and
emotionally charged issue than the entire
platform as it now stands. If enough
thought were given to this question the
UNP might still capture some public
imagination.
The second half of this report on the
UNP will appear in the next isstie.


What Mao
said to Malraux
Behind de Gaulle’s Press Conference- a Paris-Peking Axis
From CLAUDE KRIEF in Paris
The most closely guarded State secret
in Paris these days has nothing to
do with General de Gaulle’s health
or the progress of France’s nuclear deter-
rent. It is the Malraux report on his trip
to China. The Quai d’Orsay, though kept
partially informed, has found itself out-
side the closed circle. The Cabinet has
been entitled to only a watered-down
version, whereas M. Malraux, the Mini-
ster of Culture, has unburdened himself
of the messages he brought back only
in the course of two tetes-a-tetes first
of all, of course, to General de Gaulle
himself, and then in an incomplete form
to the Prime Minister, M. Pompidou.
Until now, France’s allies have not
received any official communications on
the subject, however close their interest
in the China problem. Why the
mystery?
In fact, the journey has clearly been
the key to General de Gaulle’s recent
Press conference. The General is pre-
paring new plans for world organisation
and his China policy is an essential
element in his projects. For this reason,
General de Gaulle deferred his usual
July Press conference and entrusted
Andre Malraux with his “information
mission”, saying to him: “Go along and
find out just what those Chinese really
want.”
China fascinates, worries and puzzles
de Gaulle. This is awkward for him
since he plans to use China to further
some of his essential objectives. All
Western diplomats are, by now, aware
of these: to destroy the world order
inherited from Yalta and Bretton Woods,
to break the hegemony of the Big Two
the USA and the Soviet Union
and the complex of institutions which
enable them to maintain it. Whether it
concerns European integration, the
Atlantic Alliance, the “gold exchange
standard”, the United Nations as it now
functions, or efforts to prevent the
proliferation of nuclear arms, he sees
only so many attempts to prolong an
order that is naturally disintegrating.
But this order exists. It can be fought
only by substituting another order, by
successive transformations, if possible
without violence. For this task, he needs
China, and China —it seemed to him
was eluding him until now.
He had, nevertheless, placed high
hopes in the birth of the Paris-Peking
axis. It was absurd, he argued, not to
recognise China for what it was and,
above all, for what it would be 20 years
from now; one of the leading world
powers. It was equally absurd not to
foresee a future war between China and
Russia. What, then, does China want?
Does she want war, or the creation of
a rival world organisation? What is
China’s view of the world? These are
the questions whose answers Andre
Malraux tried to find in Peking.
On one point, at least, he brought back
a positive answer. Yes, China does want
to enter the United Nations, but only
by the front door—by regaining her seat
in the Security Council. This is im-
portant news. For more than six months
Peking has been intensifying its offensive
against the UN, by presenting it as an
instrument exclusively in the hands of
ANDRE MALRAUX
American imperialism, as a tool which
enables Washington to extend its control
over the world with Soviet complicity.
“This idol must be razed,” said Mr
Chen Yi, the Chinese Foreign Minister,
after Indonesia’s departure. And in
picturesque language, a Government
declaration added:
“Some people claim that UN is
dangerous and that, as the proverb
runs, one must not tickle a tiger’s
behind, President Sukarno has tickled
the tiger’s behind and this helps us
get rid of the UN cult.”
Week after week, Peking has multi-
plied its soundings with a view to
creating an international organisation
serving the Third World. These efforts
have all been in vain: not one of the
great Afro-Asian leaders has allowed
himself to be tempted by this prospect
and it seems that today the Chinese are
drawing a lesson from this failure
unless their campaign was merely tactical
and aimed only at strengthening theij
cards to gain admission. In any case, 1
soon as the next session of the UnitJ
Nations opens, on September 21, a nef
battle for China’s admission will begin
And Peking has hinted to M. Malra 4
that it would be pleased if France thr&
her weight into this battle, on China
side.
One way in which France could d
this, the Chinese hinted, would be by put
ting pressure on certain African States
Will de Gaulle dare to push the French
speaking Africans into voting as a bloi
for Peking’s admission, thus provokini
the anger of Washington at a time whei
President Johnson is committing hi

war?
In making his choice, the Frencl]
President has additional cards to play,
One of his great anxieties has been the
possibility of a nuclear war in Asia. The
Chinese refusal to negotiate has alarmed
de Gaulle. Some arguments used byj
the Chinese Premier, Mr Chou En-laiJ
have been brought back to him. Mr]
Chou is said to have insisted that a
nuclear war could have “positive effects".
There would, of course, be much destruc-
tion and millions of dead, but the end
result would be the triumph of Com-
munism.
Does it not follow that Peking may
be trying to drag Moscow against itsj
will into a conflict? To this question 1
of Andre Malraux’s, the reply was that
“fetishism” about the nuclear arms
should be avoided, because such fetish-j
ism would paralyse the world’s political!
evolution, and bog down all revolution-!
ary States in a false, peaceful co-exist-j
ence. Any Vietnamese settlement thai
would come down to a Russo-American
tete-a-tete would amount to a capitula
tion, as in Cuba. This being so, China
would hold its distance both from
“adventurism” and from “defeatism”
and would intervene only at Hanoi’s
request. And the Chinese added thai
once they were reinstated as full meni'
bers of the Security Council this couli
provide an appropriate framework foi
discussions.
Is this the card which General de
Gaulle is going to play to make the
Americans “understand” his action inj
favor of China’s entry into the UN? If
France, Russia and Great Britain agreej
that China should be admitted this yearj
Washington’s position will become mord
and more difficult.
What has France to gain from all
this? Her alliance with China coul(
indeed reduce the hegemony of the Bis
Two. But M. Malraux seems to hav
understood That whatever degree o
sympathy or admiration General d

he used to elaborate, in collaboration
w ith France, a new world order. World
order is indeed the negation of the revo-
lutionary clash of the proletarian coun-
tries against the rest, in which they see
themselves as the only leaders. This
points the limits of co-operation with
Paris.
M. Malraux seems convinced of this.
But he also believes that the road France
and China could travel together could
be fairly long. He told the French
Council of Ministers how impressed he
was by what he saw in China. Launch-
ing into one of those inspired improvisa-
tions of which he has the secret, he com-
pared Russia and China 15 years after
their respective revolutions. Within this
time, the Chinese, in his view, have
accomplished far more than the Russians
did between 1918 and 1933. M. Mal-
raux added a reflection which, it seems,
did not provoke smiles among the
j Gaullists: “Mao Tse-tung has no suc-
-1 cessor.” Here is yet another thing
j France and China have in common!
Has M. Malraux found the end
I of the Ariadne’s golden thread which
! might lead to a Vietnamese settlement?
1 If peace really does depend on Peking’s
| admission into the UN, French diplo-
macy might play a leading part. This
i would be the General's last grand slam.
Electing
Bundestag 5
From mirale to explosion
By EMERY BARCS
On Sunday, September 19, some 30
million West Germans of both
sexes and over the age of 21 will
j be entitled to vote in the Federal Re-
i public’s fifth general elections since 1949.
j The fate of 521 seats in the Bundestag,
the Federal Parliament's Lower House,
will be decided on that day. (There are
no elections for the Upper House, the
Bundesrat, to which each of the 11 States
of the Federation sends a number of rep-
resentatives 41 altogether accord-
ing to their size.) Thirteen parties with
more than 1200 candidates will contest
the seats. But the question of who will
govern West Germany during the next
four years will be decided by the number
J of votes cast for the two main protagon-
ists, the Christian Democratic Union
I (CDU) and its Bavarian wing, the
1 Christian Social Union (CSU), on one
| s ‘de, and the Social Democratic Party
! (SPD) on the other,
is Daring the past 16 years the CDU/
CSU has governed West Germany alone
or in coalition. For the first time politi-
cal observers now give the Social Demo-
crats a fair chance to wrest power from
the two Union parties. Whether Herr
Willy Brandt and his Socialist team will
unseat Professor Ludwig Erhard and
his Union parties on September 19 de-
pends upon the efficacy of the main SPD
promise that in power it will make big-
ger and better the Wohlstands explosion,
the prosperity explosion which has fol-
lowed the Wirtschaftwunder, the eco-
nomic miracle. The Union parties coum-
ter this promise with the warning that
by voting for the SPD, West Germans
would risk the economic and social
achievements of the post-war years.
These achievements are undoubtedly
tremendous. From total defeat 20 years
ago, West Germany has risen to become
the world’s third largest industrial power
after the US and the Soviet Union,
On the other hand rumblings of harder
times have become quite audible recent-
ly. West Germany has the highest wages,


most extensive social benefits and short-
est working hours in the Common Mar-
ket. As a result West German industrial
prices are becoming too high for ef-
ficient competition on the export mar-
kets. For the first time in years imports
are steadily outstripping exports.
Among the contesting parties the
CDU/CSU has the most universal ap-
peal. It has followers in all 11 States and
in every social stratum. It stands for a
social welfare state, for free economic
competition tempered by State interven-
tion, if necessary, for a united Europe
and for NATO. The Bavarian CSU is
more conservative, more nationalistic
and more clerical than the CDU. Both
groups have Atlantics (pro-Americans)
and Gaullists (pro-French) among their
members and in the past they had clash-
ed repeatedly. Party unity, however, is
now fairly solid
The SPD, which has recently celebrat-
ed its 100th anniversary, is the oldest
living German political party. Since 1959
• when the party congress at Godes-
berg threw out such ballast as the class-
war, doctrinarian pacifism and wholesale
nationalisation the SPD has changed
from a class-party into an evolutionary
reformist mass party. Its supporters,
however, are still mainly industrial work-
ers. The Godesberg Programme paid off
at the 1961 elections when the SPD in-
creased its percentage of votes-from 31.8
(in 1957) to 36.2.
Besides these two the most important
party is the Free Democratic Party
(FDP) which has been in coalition with
the CDU/CSU since 1961. The FDP
is distinctly middle-class (upper and low-
er) and it has been dubbed as “a de-
fender of 19th-century liberalism in the
20th century”. The party is against the
Welfare State. In foreign policy it ad-
vocates the creation of friendlier ties —
especially trade ties with Communist
countries, including East Germany.
The German Constitution provides
that only parties which obtain at least
five per cent of the total vote are en-
titled to seats in the Bundestag. Except
for the CDU/ CSU, the SPD and the
FDP, no other party is credited with a
chance of receiving the necessary
1,500,000 votes —or more —on Sep-
tember 19. Yet the leaders of two ex-
tremist groups are confident that they
will receive much more than the mini-
mum of five per cent. They are the neo-
Nazi National Democratic Party (NDP)
and the crypto-Communist German
Peace Union (DFU). And they are worth
watching.
The percentage of votes cast for these
two parties (the other small parties are
hopeless “ratbag” shows) will give a fair
indication of the state of political ex-
tremism in West Germany today.
THE WEEK
OVERSEAS
KASHMIR
No Illusions
T AST week the undeclared war widened.
The Pakistanis, supported by Ameri-
can-supplied tanks and planes that were
more than a match for the Indian
artillery, rolled across the canefields to
the outskirts of Akhnur, 18 miles from
the truce line, thus threatening the single
road India uses to supply her Kashmir
garrison. India reacted with a flanking
move a three-pronged attack toward
Lahore, Pakistan’s second - largest city,
and followed up with a lunge from
Jammu in Kashmir. The moves relieved
Pakistani pressure in Kashmir and
threatened the Pakistanis’ own supply
route to that fighting zone.
On Friday India hinted the war might
spread to East Pakistan, on the other
side of the Indian land mass. An Indian
spokesman reported air attacks from East
Pakistan against the Indian States of
Assam and West Bengal. In Rawalpindi,
the Pakistan capital, and in New Delhi
preparations were begun against air raids.
In all past instances of trouble over
Kashmir the spotlight swung dramatic-
ally to the Security Council. But last
week as the conflict broadened and the
Council met again, there was a feeling
of impotence within the UN in the
face of the seeming determination of
the Indians and Pakistanis to have it
out. The answers to the peace appeal
came in: India accepted subject to a
guarantee against further Pakistani in-
filtration, but President Ayub wanted
Indian agreement to a plebiscite as part
of any new truce. Secretary-General
U Thant left for Rawalpindi, saying: “I
have no illusions about this mission.”
After seeing President Ayub and then
moving to New Delhi at the weekend,
his chances of working out a compromise
formula acceptable to both sides were
not rated high.
The levers of influence in the present
crisis, it was felt, lay not in the UN
but in Washington and Peking. For
Washington the war came as a crashing
and ironic climax to a triangular relation-
ship between the United States, Pakistan
and India in which illusion, hard-headed-
ness and calculated risk were present to
some degree at different times for all
the parties concerned.
In Moscow the Russians offered both
sides its good offices. Soviet Communist
Party leader Brezhnev said the Pakistan-
India conflict “further aggravated the
situation in South-East Asia” and called
on the adversaries to “show restraint and
wisdom” and stop the fight. From Peking
came charges of Indian “aggression”
against Pakistan.
FRANCE
De Gaulle Speaks
At 3 p.m. last Thursday, as 1000
* French and foreign reporters stood
waiting in the glare of television lights,
the red velvet curtains parted in the gilt,
salle des fetes of the Ely see Palace in
Paris. Ushers in swallowtail coats entered!
first. Then came the tall, erect figure of
President de Gaulle. He sat, waved re-
porters to their seats and thanked them
for coming.
Thus began de Gaulle’s 12th news con-
ference since 1959 when he took office
as President of the Fifth Republic.
Throughout the one-and-a-half-hour ses-
sion, the French leader speaking with-
out notes hammered home the theme
of French nationalism. While the Presi-
dent has expressed his views privately
to visitors, this was the first time he de-
fined his plans so precisely in public.
What it added up to was a threat to dis-
rupt NATO and possibly the European j
Common Market, unless his demands for
reorganisation are met. j
On NATO the General served notice
that after 1969 France would no longer*
accept an integrated Western defence
system.
On the Common Market, de Gaulle
made it clear that France would lift its
boycott of the Market only on iron-clad
assurances that there would be no further
political integration of Europe and that,
France would not be asked to sacrifice
any part of its “national personality”.
USSR
Pravda v. Izvesfia
“Pravda”, the name of the Soviet Com-
munist Party newspaper, is the
Russian word for “truth”. “Izvestia”,
the name of the Soviet Government’s
newspaper, is the Russian word for
“news”. Together the two papers re-
flect the official Soviet doctrine of thej
day. Last week the world was treated
to the phenomenon of “Pravda” attack-
ing “Izvestia” for not telling the truth
and for suppressing the news.
The issue—intellectual freedom —was
one on which Soviet policy has vacillated

for years. “Pravda’s” attack was con-
tained in a 5000-word article by the
paper’s editor, Aleksei Rumyantsev. He
accused “Izvestia”, as well as the Com-
munist Party’s farm affairs paper
“Selskaya Zhizn” (Rural Life), of sup-
pressing intellectual freedom. Specifically,
Mr Rumyantsev criticised “Izvestia” for
condemning those Soviet writers who
have had the temerity to suggest that
life in Russia was not as rosy as most
ideologists would have it. “Izvestia”,
according to “Pravda’s” editor, was fol-
lowing a “preconceived, one - sided
attitude” that “can bring no benefit” to
the Soviet Union.
Since such a public clash on an im-
portant ideological issue is unpre-
cedented in the Soviet, the article raised
speculation about a high-level split
within the Soviet Government. But who
actually was involved and how the Soviet
leadership was aligned on the issue was
unclear.
VIETNAM
The Long Haul
Henry Cabot Lodge, who returned
11 to Saigon recently as United States
Ambassador, assessed the situation in
Vietnam last week as follows: “When I
left in July of 1964 there was a question
in many people’s minds as to the chances
of success in the effort to ward off Viet-,
cong aggression. Now I find an atmos-
phere in which it is generally agreed that
the Vietcong cannot win militarily.”
Mr Lodge’s statements on television
—■referred to the changes brought about
by the American build-up and the almost
continuous aerial bombardment of the
Communists since last February. As a
result of these measures, the Vietcong
guerrillas have been kept off balance
during recent weeks, permitting the Gov-
ernment to give more thought to econo-
mic and social improvements
But such programmes were for the
long haul. The immediate problem still
was to draw the Communists into peace
talks and achieve some sort of cease-fire.
In the absence of any visible Communist
movement towards the conference table
Washington and Saigon last week con-
tinued their military pressure, with US
strength in Vietnam rising to 128,000
men.
Yet perhaps the biggest obstacle in
gaining popular support throughout the
country is the war effort itself. The in-
creasing US and South Vietnam strikes
against the Vietcong who hide among
,the peasants are killing increasing
numbers of civilians and demolishing
their homes. Such actions are not calcu-
lated to win friends, and officials at
US headquarters are known to be giving
this problem priority attention.

Letters to the Editor
Kashmir
SIR. May I take the opportunity of inviting
your attention to the editorial "Escalation in
Kashmir", published in your esteemed journal
on September 11, 1965, which among other
things describes India's legal and moral
position in Kashmir as "indefensible".
I should take the legal position first. I
imagine that by legal position you refer to
the validity of Kashmir's accession to India
and extension of India's territorial sovereignty
over Kashmir thereafter. You will perhaps
remember the British Government's announce-
ment of June 3, 1947, that the partition of
India would be confined to British India and
Indian States should enter into a Federal
relationship with the successor Government
or Governments in British India. Provision for
accession was made in the Government of
India Act of 1935 as adopted under the In-
dependence of India Act of 1947 which
among other things states:
"An Indian State shall be deemed to
have acceded to the Dominion if the Gov-
ernor-General has signified his acceptance
of an instrument of accession executed by
the ruler thereof."
Following this procedure, rulers of more
than 500 Indian States acceded either to India
or to Pakistan by execution of the instrument
of accession which was accepted either by
the Governor-General of India or of Pakistan
as the case was. The choice of accession
either to India or to Pakistan was left
entirely at the discretion of the ruler, and
after accession a State's separate existence
was merged either with India or Pakistan.
The Maharajah of Kashmir, who was the
ruling prince of the State with the support
of the largest political party having Sheikh
Abdullah as its leader, executed the instru-
ment of accession to India which was
accepted by the then Governor-General of
India, Lord Mountbatten. This is how Kashmir
became an integral part of India. It would
be worthwhile to mention here that Kashmir's
accession to India has never been challenged
by the UN Commission or by the Security
Council.
After Kashmir's accession, Sheikh Abdullah,
who was then the Prime Minister of the State
and leader of the Kashmir Constituent
Assembly, on June 18, 1948, said:
"We, the people of Jammu and Kashmir,
have thrown our lot with the Indian people
not in the heat of passion or a moment
of despair but by deliberate choice. This
is self-determination."
If this constitutional position of Kashmir is
accepted, India, you will perhaps agree, has
the moral right to govern Kashmir in the
same way as the rest of India is governed.
India is not governing anybody by force, but
by the willing consent of her people. The
State of Jammu and Kashmir has its own
legislature, the members of which are elected
by the people of Kashmir by a universal
adult suffrage. The people of Kashmir enjoy
the same rights and privileges as are guaran-
teed by the Constitution of India. The Gov-
ernment of the State has been doing every-
thing possible to develop the State to increase
the material prosperity of Kashmiri people.
It is a fact that India wanted to hold
plebiscite in Kashmir, but this pledge is to
be understood in the context of the promise
given to the people of Kashmir and not to
Pakistan. Pakistan has no locus standi in
Kashmir except as an aggressor.
I would like to draw your special attention
to the United Nations Security Council's
resolutions of August 13, 1948, ancf January
5, 1949. Both the resolutions firmly stated that
the presence of Pakistani troops in Kashmir
constitutes a material change in the situation
and Pakistan must withdraw all her troops,
both regular and irregular, horn Kashmir to
create a favorable climate for holding plebis-
cite in that State. Pakistan agreed to with-
draw her troops but during the last 18 years
she has failed to do so, thus making a
plebiscite in Kashmir impossible. India, as
you will understand, was unable to wait
indefinitely and wished to ascertain the
wishes of the people of Kashmir in a suitable
manner. Kashmir has gone through three
general elections and the Kashmir National
Assembly unanimously voted for the State's
final accession to India. So the purpose of
holding plebiscite to determine the wishes
of the people of Kashmir was fulfilled.
Pakistan's claim of Kashmir is purely com-
munal. Pakistan has been shouting from the
house tops to "liberate four million Kashmiri
Muslims from oppressive Indian rule" for-
getting the fact that India is peopled by 60
million Muslims. Pakistan's approach is a
vicious communal approach, repugnant to the
entire spirit animating our national struggle
for independence and is contrary to our
Constitution which allows no discrimination
on the basis of race, religion, caste and
creed.

The Bite of Poverty
SIR. You refer briefly (B„ August 28) to
a report given to the ANZAAS Congress by
Professors Edwards and Gates that the
average family income in Sydney is £42 per
week. Surely this quotation, presented out
of context, gives a misleading and socially
dangerous picture of prosperity that can
allow the smug reader to forget the economic
hardships that beset many Australians. A
few months ago, in a survey of the social
attitudes and opinions of "householders" in
Perth, a research team of psychologists in-
cidentally asked respondents to state their
income or, if married, the combined husband
and wife income. The median income was
approximately £26 per week, and the mean
was under £27. Nearly one third of the
respondents reported an income of under £2O
per week.
Our sample was based on a carefully
executed area sampling technique and I
feel confident, on the basis of the data on
birth-place, occupations and standards of
education, that it represented an almost un-
biased sample of adults living in Perth. The
only bias was the omission of the 10 per cent
of underprivileged people, the senile, sick,
shiftless and non-English speaking, who could
not even be interviewed and who mostly con-
stitute the really poor. Are Sydney-siders
nearly twice as prosperous as Perthites? It
is doubtful. Does the average of all house-
holds contain children earning £l6 per week?
Also doubtful. The quotation from the ANZAAS
paper must be seen in the context of ct
struggle for existence on the part of a sub-
stantial proportion of our population, and the
genuine bite of poverty on hundreds of thou-
sands of our citizens.

Eric Butler and Anti-Semitism
SlR.—Your review of Mr Gott's little 4s. hate-
voice about Mr Butler (B„ Aug. 28) raises
a number of questions: Why these illiberal
attacks on one of the few competent public
figures who understand Communism in depth?
Must anti-Communists fight other anti-Com-
munists, just to maintain their "non-extremist"
credit-rating with the comrats? If Messrs Gott
and Buckley disagree with Mr Butler, fine.
But why must they who claim to represent
"reason and reflection" against "prejudice
and instinct" do so in such shrill, shrieking
tones?
Since Mr Butler directs practically all his
energies against Communism, while his de-
tractors direct all of theirs against his alleged
"anti-Semitism", does it not follow that the
latter is but a handy red herring with which
to smear Butler, the anti-Communist? Of
course bigotry is evil. But is ritualistic anti-
anti-Semitism any better? Or why don't we
read of the State of Israel being "anti-Semitic"
whenever it does anything the Arabs don't
like? Besides, where has Mr Butler ever
attacked Jews as such, on racial grounds?
But if his real objection is to an overt
political movement, Zionism, which is opposed
also by many Jews, is he not entitled to a
courteous and rational discussion? And even
if he did have some eccentric notions about
Jews, must we all become hysterical and
demand his crucifixion—or at least 1 a periodic
"Two Minutes Hate"? No Christian can
excuse Hitler's atrocities. I suspect, however,
that also many Jews are sick and tired of
the everlasting yammering in the world Press
about the six million, when that same Press
modestly averts its eyes from the murder of
tens of millions of Christians under barbaric
Communism in our time!

Malaysian Students
SIR. —I would like to register a protest on
behalf of the Malaysian students, and in
particular the Malaysians interviewed by
your reporter. Extracts from these interviews
appeared in your magazine under the heading
"Un-Australian" (B„ Sept. 4). It would appear
from your magazine report that the three
Malaysian students you quoted were individu-
als airing their private grievances. I would
point out that Mr K. Sivakumar of Serera-
ban, was speaking on behalf of the Overseas
Students' Council of New South Wales, of
which he is President. Mr Y. O. Sun is the
Vice-President of the Overseas Students'
Council of New South Wales and immediate
past president of the Overseas Students'
Association, while Mr J. R. Menon is the
President of the National Union of the Malay-
sian-Singapore Students of Australia.
I hereby conclude that it is of utmost
importance that the designations be printed.
The public has to have the knowledge that
these statements came from responsible
people, representing between them over six
thousand overseas students. It should also
have been noted that the resolutions men-
tioned were adopted also by the NUAUS.

•yy :< "
TOYOTA DYNA 2 TON (top)-TOYOTA 25 1 TON (above)
TWO tough ones. One-ton Toyota 25,
two-ton Toyota Dyna have more practical
reasons why you should buy than any
other light truck on the market today.
Load space for one: More usable carrying
space than trucks anywhere near their
size or price. Toughness, too: Toyota’s
own kind of rugged construction that’s
built to take the year 'round pounding of
hard truck work. Reliability: No fancy
ideas—just sound, proven truck design
to do the job you want and to be rarely
off the road. Plenty of power: Toyota 25
—55 b.h.p. and Toyota Dyna—Bs b.h.p.,
both have enough power to do the job
with ample reserve, but give the kind
of money-saving economy that means
the difference between profit and loss.
And no wasted power either. If you’re
truck buying, give both these Toyotas the
once over at your local Toyota dealer, it’s
money in your pocket all the way.
TOYOTA DYNA is especially suitable for mount-
ing special bodies. Standard model has a long,
wide cargo deck with a loading area of 65
square feet. Vacuum booster brakes for safe,

Composer’s High Score
From BETTY BEST in London
Australian-born composer Malcolm
Williamson, whose violin concerto,
with Yehudi Menuhin as soloist,
is being played by the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra at the opening performance of
the Commonwealth Festival on Septem-
ber 16 in London, has just cancelled a
projected visit home.
Williamson had hoped to play some
of his own works at the Adelaide and
Perth Festivals but pressure of work and
future commissions have forced him to
drop out. “I had so looked forward to
going as I have not been home for 13
years,” he said. “But I’m afraid it will
have to be postponed until 1967 when
the various opera and ballet works I
have on hand are finished.”
Menuhin, with Benjamin Britten,
commissioned the violin concerto. Wil-
liamson said he was shocked to hear
that Sir Bernard Heinze would not be in
London with the orchestra to conduct
the concert.
“I dedicated the score of ‘The Dis-
play’, which the Australian Ballet will
dance at Covent Garden on October 2,
to Sir Bernard and thought it would be
a happy coincidence if he were here
to conduct it for the London premiere,”
Williamson said.
The violin concerto, which is in three
movements, is dedicated to Dame Edith
Sitwell. “I was in the middle of writing
it when she died and the last movement
is a memorial to her,” Williamson said.
Last month his concerto grosso, com-
missioned by the BBC, was played by
the London Symphony Orchestra, con-
ducted by Colin Davis at the prom con-
certs at the Royal Albert Hall. Concerto
grosso is in three movements, the first
featuring the strings only, the second an
answer from the brass, the final move-
ment Williamson calls a “free-for-all”.
The concerto also has a solo for
tympanist.
Another of his BBC commissions, and
the biggest of his orchestral works so
far, had its first performance at the
Edinburgh Festival. This is Symphonic
Variations, a work of five movements
with virtuoso writing for every section
of the orchestra, which was conducted
by Czech Vilem Tausky and played by
the BBC Concert Orchestra.
Williamson works at a remarkably
fast rate although he says he never feels
that this is so when working.
“The more I write the more I throw
away,” he said. “Each movement of
Symphonic Variations has been written
over and over again. But nothing you
ever compose is good enough. The con-
ception is always loftier than the result,
though speed or slowness have no effect
on quality. Composition for me is com-
pulsive. I find myself overpoweringly
excited at the sight of a blank sheet of
paper.”
With the programme ahead of him,
it is fortunate that he does.
His most recent opera, “The Happy
Prince”, which was first performed at
the Farnham Festival last spring, will
be recorded soon by the Royal Opera
House and Sadler’s Wells singers on the
Argo label.
MALCOLM WILLIAMSON
The year began auspiciously for Wil-
liamson when he was invited to Vienna
to play his organ concerto with the
Vienna Symphony. The performance
was broadcast throughout Europe.
On September 21 Williamson will play
the piano for his own composition,
“Celebration of Divine Love”, to be
broadcast with Barbara Elsy, the English
soprano, singing the words of Australian
poet James McAuley. “It is a piece I
wrote to McAuley’s poem about three
years ago,” Williamson said, “but if one
is playing oneself one has to be in per-
forming trim. Fortunately, I find it easy
to limber up for a performance, due, I
am convinced, to the excellent training
we pianists received at the Sydney Con-
servatorium.”
Williamson will, next year, play his
own third piano concerto for its first
performance in Britain under the baton
of Sir Adrian Boult with the Halle
Orchestra. This work, commissioned by
the ABC in 1960, was played in Aus-
tralia for the first time last year when
John Ogden performed it in Sydney and
Melbourne.
Williamson has almost finished a new
children’s opera called “Julius Caesar
Jones”, which will have children and
adults in the cast.
He describes it as a “way-out fantasy”
in which children in a normal household
are discovered living in a “rich, macabre
dream-world of their own which the
adults know nothing about”. The libret-
tist for this work is Geoffrey Dunn, who
also wrote the libretto for “The English
Eccentrics” performed at Sadler’s Wells
two years ago.
Sadler’s Wells have now commissioned
a third opera from Williamson, “The
Violins of St Jacques”, based on a story
set in the Caribbean by Patrick Leigh
Fermor. Due to have its premiere next
April, it is set on a volcanic island at
the turn of the century. It opens with
Mardi Gras and deals with the love
tangles of the Creoles who live on the
island.
Another work which has to be ready
for Sadler’s Wells by next year is Wil-
liamson’s new ballet “Black Robin”,
which he is writing to a story from play-
wright David Rudkin. It will be per-
formed by the Western Theatre Ballet.
He now has commissions on his
hands which go right through to 1969.
The most recent is a choral opera for
which Ursula Vaughan Williams, widow
of Sir Ralph Vaughan Williams, is
writing the libretto.
Mirams’ Double
Feature
By PATRICK TENNISON
man currently having most
success promoting Australian film
endeavor is 47 - year - old Roger
Mirams, New Zealand-born but with
Australian interests very much at heart
in the film field. In a sort of double-
feature success, his 90-minute color
musical “Funny Things Happen Down
Under”, is now on a New Zealand
cinema circuit, will be screened on Sep-
tember 20 at the Commonwealth Arts
Festival in London and has been viewed
by executives of an Australian cinema
chain with exhibition in mind. The other
feature on the double-success bill is his
being commissioned by the US television
organisation Screen Gems to produce 26
episodes of a color TV series set in the
South Pacific to be known as “Adven-
tures of the Seaspray”.
With a sort of contained excitement,
not helped by tiredness with tripping
between his South Melbourne business
headquarters, Pacific Films, and location


work already going on in Fiji, he is
inclined in an interview to switch sud-
denly from one venture to the other
with confusing results. The “ Seaspray ”
venture he describes as “the biggest thing
in Australian TV production today. It
will mean employment for about 75 Aus-
tralian actors,” he said. “It has to be
shot in color because it is for NBC in
America and 90 per cent of their TV
shows will be in color by Christmas.”
“Funny Things”, despite its small
budget and the fact that it was made over
about five months in breaks, for every-
one concerned it meant regular work.
Producer Mirams can rightly claim it to
be the first all-Australian film for about
20 years and probably this country’s first
musical —certainly its only one in color.
Its story is a whimsical one about a
group of youngsters who discover a way
to breed sheep with colored wool. 'Such
a process saves a lot of post-shearing
fiddling around with dyes. It also pro-
vides a lot of opportunities for colorful
camera work.
Looking alarmingly like a younger
Cecil B. De Mille, Roger Mirams started
film work on that ultra big production
“World War Two”, when he was a war
correspondent and cameraman. He
started his Pacific Films company in
New Zealand after the war, crossing the
Tasman a few years later tor the bigger
chances he knew must be here. For a
while he made commercials. “Just for
a while and I’ll never go back to that,’'
he says with distaste at the memory.
“It’s the most frustrating thing in the
world, with everyone from the advertis-
ing agencies to a budding movie pro-
ducer.”
His biggest earlier hits have been the
TV series “The Terrible Ten” and then
“The Magic Boomerang”, both shown
on TV locally and sold overseas. “Funny
Things” and then “Seaspray” have been
bigger developments from these. And
he is feeling even happier when he starts
thinking of the future.
“As time goes on, there will be an
increasing need here and overseas for the
hour and the hour-and-a-half feature
film. The need will be colossal. As I
see it, we could make films like this for
use in cinemas here and for TV use in
other countries. Thanks to our ex-
perience in this field, we have now found
the formula. And (hat’s why Screen
Gems is giving us their support. And
what support ... In Suva recently we
needed some special lights for some
tricky shooting we had to do in a cave.
We rang Hollywood and a whole heap
°f lighting equipment everything we
needed was on the next plane. Just
like that.
“They’ve taken a lot of money out of
Australia over the years, but now they’re
Prepared to put some back.”
TELEVISION
Sociologists’ Field-Day
Shirley Temple Theatre. Channel 9, Sydney.
Tt was Graham Greene, I think, who
A was sued (successfully) for calling
her a midget. She was the biggest box-
office star in America at a time when
children could beat the pants off a Greta
Garbo in the popularity stakes. Some-
one even suggested she should star in
a knee-high “Grand Hotel” with Bobby
Breen, Freddie Bartholomew, and Jackie
Cooper and Jackie Coogan playing op-
posite her. She would arrive at premieres
to banks of primroses, pipe bands,
screaming thousands and the freedom of
cities, only to disappear immediately
before the performance to be in bed by
the regulation time. She was directed by
John Ford and Walter Lang, appeared
in versions of Maeterlinck and Kipling,
and met Einstein.
The Shirley Temple myth is the most
durable of the child-star myths of the
’thirties, and has recently been under-
going a thorough re-
vival on TCN. Each
Sunday, at lunchtime,
the winking, knowing,
simpering moppet in
shapeless ’thirties grey
flannels and precoci-
ous sweater goes
through her astonish-
ingly mature routines,
making one wonder
whether the whole
thing wasn’t the brain-
child of a feverishly
decadent Twentieth
Century Fox producer. It all makes
“Lolita” look like “Jemima Puddleduck”:
the dainty body propped on the knees of
a dozen successive grey-beards, playfully
pulling their whiskers, rolling her (pre-
sumably china-blue) eyes at theirs, then
jumping athletically to the floor to sway,
arms stretched wide, into a high-powered
dance routine. One remembers Greene’s:
“A coquetry as mature as Miss Colbert’s”
(this was 1936) “and a body as voluptu-
ous ... as Miss Dietrich’s.”
And the classic of the series so far
has been “Captain January”: I even
prefer it to the splendid “Curly Top ”,
with its orphanage setting early on,
Shirley and the other tots smuggling
a horse in to fondle, the star belting out
“The Good Ship Lollypop” at, of all
things, the Dothegirls Hall refectory
table, and the usual array of flint-faced
killjoys bursting in to still her singing.
In “Captain January” the sentiment
and sea setting hark back splendidly to
the Victorian world of Grace Darling,
the Wreck of the Hesperus, and the
Flannel Isle Light: an orphan plucked
from the sea is raised by a grizzled
lighthouse-keeper, only to have her
happiness in that very symbolic tower
threatened by the arrival of a sexually
repressed school-inspector. The climax
is really fine: Shirley’s future happiness
hangs on a thread as she competes with
the inspector’s nephew in an examina-
tion; if she wins, all will be well, and a
further sojourn in the lighthouse hers.
“Stowaway” was good, too. In this,
Shirley is Ching-Chang, an orphan left
high and dry in a ’thirties Shanghai; she
smuggles herself into the rumble-seat of
a car driven by a dashing playboy (no
doubt very Freudian, again), and makes
her way on board ship, where, with un-
nerving knowingness, she induces a
couple to marry for convenience, simply
so she can acquire legal guardians. And
all this involves the break-up of an
eng agem e n t, and
some sly negotiating
of man and woman
together on and below
decks that would have
done justice to a
master matchmaker.
And Shirley even ven-
tures proverbs: “A
child without parents
is a ship without a
rudder,” she lisps
brightly as she sets
her beady eyes on the
match which is to
make her future existence rosy {of course
the couple have money).
In “Little Miss Broadway” she
achieved an apotheosis of a kind by sing-
ing to at least a score of greybeards; in
an astonishing last sequence, she per-
suaded a crusty old judge to allow his
courtroom to be converted into a con-
cert-hall in which old men sang and
played music for an audience: geronto-
philia could scarcely go further.
A field day for sociologists, certainly,
as well as for psychologists: in all
Shirley's films, someone very acute was
at work. The attempt to love and be
loved thwarted by wowsers who are in
the end defeated; the desire for money
and power cloaked in infantile female,
charm; the high-kicking dances and eye-
rollings and dandlings on rich ancients’
knees: all, in its way, a kind of sub-teen
parallel to the wish-fulfilment fantasies
Hollywood was then providing with an
energy gone forever.

TELEVISION
Looking Back
"Recalling some of the strange claims
■*-*' of the ABC publicists during earlier
serials, which were to “My Brother Jack”
as windjammers to airliners, it is re-
markable that this time so little has been
said about so much, in the Commission’s
advertising. Perhaps someone thought
the product was so good that the re-
viewers would do the rest, but so far
they have almost damned the serial
with faint praise. The news should be
shouted from all the tall gum trees that
a worthy Australian production is on
view, and it is not too late to tune in.
“My Brother Jack” was adapted for
television from the George Johnston
novel by his wife Charmian, an arrange-
ment which has given us benefit of the
talents of two good writers. The TV
story begins in the early 1930 s and
follows the progress of young Davey,
who wants to be a writer, and his elder
brother Jack Meredith, amaetur Aus-
tralian League footballer and a bit of
a lad until he meets his Sheila. Their
mother is a saint and their old dad a
curmudgeon. The action is fairly
reminiscent of the way life was during
the Depression, or to anyone under 35,
history.
The serial is not faultless, but some of
its imperfections are those of most
adaptations from a novel. Dad’s transi-
tion from the man Mum followed to
France in the war to the man we are
shown is not explained. In the produc-
tion great care has been taken to get an
authentic period look, but I would query
the cloth cap to which Brother Jack is
addicted. Photos of the time in the
“Age” and “Argus” suggest this head-
wear was no more popular in Melbourne
than it was in Sydney. I put it down
to one man’s idiosyncracy, until an artist
named Sam also donned one and
stretched credence. This picture of an
era which stretched perhaps from 1910
to 1940 is a faithful one.
In the four episodes so far, “My
Brother Jack” is not wildly dramatic.
It is a story of fairly ordinary men and
women, and it is greatly to the credit of
producer and actors that the cast
manages to play average people so very
well. More writers may be encouraged
to risk a television drama now that
George Johnston has broken the ice.
Unfortunately, our actors have so
little regular work that they are willing
to take any loot on offer for TV com-
mercials. From the third episode of
“Brother Jack”, when June Thody came
on strongly as Sheila, it has been dif-
ficult to avoid a feeling that she is about
to lecture on the virtues of packaged
soup. I look to the day when such a
dedicated actress will be able to say,
“Sorry, I’m too busy”.
DALE MILLER
THEATRE
Albee’s Alice
Tiny Alice. Edward Albee. Union Theatre,
Melbourne.
TTere is another play that is almost un-
A reviewable. What it tries to say can-
not be grasped intellectually, though if
one had 5000 words to translate feeling-
states into thoughts something coherent
might emerge. American critics got
round the problem by employing inspired
generalisations. One can see why, for
“Tiny Alice” does not come near being
a play in the accepted sense, yet it is
impressive theatre.
At the deepest, farthest reach of cer-
tain neuroses the sufferer experiences hal-
lucinations that can be very close to
illuminations. Everything his mind and
body touches seems to be charged with an
unbearable, immediate “energy”—cosmic
particles, the neutrons of reality.
At the bottom of the pit, good and
evil, love and cruelty, Christ and Satan,
the black and white mass are one. Sadism
and masochism inseparable from
martyrdom, sacrifice and self-surrender
fuse in a poetic alchemy that unites,
penetrates and explodes every cerebral
contradiction. In inexpressible agony
man is united with and lost in the
universe.
—* The old playwrights thought of their
characters as individuals symbolising
human qualities and aspirations. The
new playwright (and especially Albee)
does not create individuals in this sense
at all. In “Tiny Alice” each so-called
FRANK THRING as the Cardinal in
"Tiny Alice", Union Repertory Theatre,
Melbourne.
person is a myriad of persons; the cruel-
lest is also the sweetest, Lucifer is also
Michael.
It is extraordinarily exciting, like a
new ritual, but it is not a work for the
emotionally disturbed. Even though, once
again, the last part is tedious, it leaves
“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” far
behind. The guest is still being hunted
but across a vaster hell and a higher
heaven.
A young lay priest, Julian, sent by a
dubious Cardinal on a dubious errand,
goes to live in the mansion of the
mysterious Alice, the richest woman in
the world. With her are the lawyer and
an identity called Butler two men,
two forces, two “humors” ... no use
trying to say more about them.
Within the house there is a chapel, and
within the chapel there is a model of the
whole establishment. Julian, who has
spent six years in an asylum, is made to
marry Alice. He is tempted to his death,
the martyrdom of body and spirit. Who
and where is the true Alice, his love and
anti-self? Is she in the mansion or in the
model or in the model inside the
model? The thing Julian has to accept
is that she is everywhere and nowhere,
as in a Zen paradox, but to accept it
requires that he abolish all the frontiers
by which he marks his life.
The five figures in this play behave and
talk like creatures who have stepped
from Eiiot’s “Cocktail Party” into the
brothel in “Ulysses”, or from Orson
Welles’ “Xanadu” into the hotel in “Ma-
rienbad”. To each adheres a particular
perfume: the Cardinal’s holy viciousness
is different from the tortured bestiality of
the lawyer and from Butler’s ironio
demon. In Miss Alice, virgin and vampire
combine. Julian is perhaps a Saint
Anthony locked in the cell of his flesh
and faith. From this he is released by a
revolver shot to face eternity at last with
the cry of “Thy will be done”.
The atmosphere of sinister elation is
sustained by a quintet of powerful per-
formances. Frank Thring is the Cardinal,
Edward Hepple the lawyer, Frederick
Parslow is Julian and Alan Hopgood,
Butler, a kind of light-hearted exe-
cutioner. Each has the wit to trust the
script and to let himself be moulded by
its pressures. For this, credit belongs to
the producer, John Sumner, who has
understood that Albee does not have to
be interpreted through selective emphasis.
It is rare to be at a play where the
audience cannot at any given moment
explain what is going on but where its
attention is completely held. Bunney
Brooke has been given a part that zig-
zags between extremes but must not sug-
gest hysteria. It is worthy of a Beatrix
Lehman, and Miss Brooke knows how
to convey woman, witch and madonna.
“Tiny Alice” is as avant-garde as you
can hope to see, but it points away from

This is the gateway to the East, the only city in the world
where East truly meets West, where there is complete

Matters of
Principle
The Best Man. Director, Franklin Schaff-
ner. Embassy Theatre, Sydney.
The Sandpiper. Director, Vincente Min-
nelli. St James and Liberty Theatres,
Sydney.
Anc of the most satisfying films of
recent months, “The Best Man”,
manages to tell a story with important
moral issues without degenerating into
a tract; though it deals with ideas, its
characters are recognisable, complex
human beings, never just mouthpieces.
Against the feverish background of a
convention to choose a US presidential
candidate is played out the behind-
scenes personal battle between the two
likeliest starters. Both are eminently
sincere, each has a weakness: one be-
cause his ability to see both sides of a
question leads to indecisiveness, the other
because his narrow view of his own aims
leads to ruthlessness. The ageing retiring
President, whose endorsement will mean
victory to the candidate he chooses,
views them with growing exasperation;
as a professional politician he knows that
in politics a man of too high principles
is useless, a man of no principles
dangerous.
Director Schaffner brings vitality and
excitement to the convention sequences
there are reminiscences of Franken-
heimer yet manages the more static
scenes without becoming stagy.
Vincente Minnelli, whose forte is the
romantic fairytale of the “Meet Me in
St Louis” kind, is hardly the ideal choice
to direct what is described as “an adult
love story”, but as “The Sandpiper” is
about as adulr and realistic as “The
Heart of Juliet Jones” it really doesn’t
matter.
Perhaps dismayed by a script both
pompous and trumpery, Richard Burton
abandons acting altogether in favor of
The Voice Beautiful. His round tones
contrast oddly with Elizabeth Taylor’s
flat, schoolgirl delivery which in
moments of high drama rises to a shrill
squeak.
Miss Taylor is cast as an artist who
is a Free Spirit she wears peculiar
clothes, mends birds’ wings with sticky
tape and lives in a palatial shack on a
lonely beach that makes her feel “like
Robinson Caruso”. The parson-head-
master of her son’s school falls hard for
her, although he’s got a nice wife and
off-screen twins (described variously as

Peerless Pears
Matthaeus Passion. Bach. Stuttgart Cham-
ber Orchestra. Conductor, Karl Muen-
chinger. Decca Stereo SET 288-91.
Four Ballades. Chopin. Vladimir Ashken-
azy. Decca Stereo SXLA 6143.
Commemorating the 20th anniversary
of the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra,
Decca recently released the complete
“Matthaeus Passion” with a cast of
singers which makes this recording
possibly the best ever. Peter Pears was
chosen as the Evangelist and in his
effortless recitatives he conveys drama
and compassion which defy description
and could only be called peerless.
A comparative newcomer is the young
Dutch singer, Elly Ameling, chosen by
Professor Muenchinger. She appears to
be the ideal interpreter in the soprano
arias.
Some devotees of this massive work
will be searching for the crispness of
the harpsichord tones. Instead of the
usual harpsichord as a continuo instru-
ment, Muenchinger uses the two organs
at Jhe Hofkapelle of Schloss Ludwigs-
burg where the recording was made.
The combination of superlative per-
formers, acoustics and recording tech-
nique, will make this album irresistible.
Star of the younger generation of
Russian pianists, Vladimir Ashkenazy
plays Chopin’s “Four Ballades” with
a very personal touch but with
brilliance and sensitivity Ashkenazy in
a sense sheds new light on these well-
known Chopin pieces. He is not over-
romantic. This is combined with flaw-
lessly clear technique and overt tender-
ness.

llmv’s “Encore” series has now be-
come an indispensable addition to
collections. A brilliant choice of Gar-
land songs; Jane Froman displayed in
ali her fine range; now the almost pain-
fully nostalgic “Noel and Gertie”, ex-
cerpts from the musicals and straight
plays in which Coward and Lawrence
co-starred. All the obvious items are
reproduced: “Zigeuner”, “I’ll Follow
My Secret Heart”, “I’ll See You Again”,
and scenes from “Private Lives” and
“Shadow Play”. Her tiny, tinny voice
and his languid tones together evoke a
pre-war world that has vanished for
ever. Delicate and refined, these agree-
ably anaemic entertainers glittered away
in a long string of escapist comedies
through the appalling ’thirties; listening
to Noel Coward’s almost unbelievably
epicene rendering of “Zigeuner”, it’s
hard to believe it existed in the same
century with the Somme, the General
Strike, the Depression, and Auschwitz.
Judy Garland’s daughter, Lisa Min-
nelli, is astonishingly like her mother
both in emotional tone and in her
driving, almost violent slamming across
of the songs. There is the same eager-
ness, the same quality of suggesting
naked pain while never losing grip of
a firm professional control. The main
difference is that Lisa Minnelli’s voice
is better trained, and so far lacks the
raw power of Judy’s. Peter Mantz con-
ducts the orchestra exactly as though
Miss Garland were singing: perhaps the
wisest thing to do in the circumstances.
Only 'One song really falls down: a
disastrous jazzing-up of “Blue Moon”.
Listen to Jane Froman’s version if you
find this as nauseating as I did.
Tom Jones, one of the British pop
singers to have emerged in the Beatles’
wake, is a very accomplished performer.
“Autumn Leaves”, accompanied by a
subtle and attractive strings, guitar and
clarinet backing from Les Reed’s band,
displays an impressive strength and
range; in the more straightforward
ballads, “The Rose” and “Skye Boat
Song”, there’s a nice feeling for keeping
the line of a melody, and Mr Jones
must be one of the few teenage faves
who doesn’t set out, teeth bared, to
murder a vintage song.

BOOKS
Proust Regained
By VIVIAN SMITH
Marcel Proust: A Biography, Volume 2.
George D. Painter. Chatto and Windus.
635. 6d.
Tt takes a long time for the great to be
safely dead and even longer some-
times for those who have had contact
with them to believe that there was any-
thing especially great about them. As
Proust himself said, “It is hard to be-
lieve that the person you were at the
theatre with last night is a genius.”
Familiarity can breed ignorance; admira-
tion its own distortions. Proust was no
exception to this rule during his lifetime,
though he has now found in George D.
Painter the ideal biographer. For Mr
Painter is never over-familiar with his
subject though he has at his disposal all
the facts that are ever likely to be re-
vealed about him. A devoted and pas-
sionate admirer of Proust, he is able to
take his genius for granted without try-
ing to diminish it (no “Portrait of a
Genius, But . . .” this) and, with com-
plete detachment, to present Proust as
he was before death and his
art changed him into his essen-
tial self. Mr Painter doesn’t
have to present a case: he gives
us the facts and they speak
most eloquently for themselves.
Vol. I of Mr Painter’s bio-
graphy took us past the change
and deepening of Proust’s
relationship with Reynaldo
Hahn and the writing of “Jean
Santeuil” to the death of
Proust’s father in 1903 and the
beginning of the great Rus-
kin translations. Vol. II picks up the
threads at this point and weaves them
through to Proust’s death in 1922 at the
height of his fame and in the middle of
the struggle against time to complete
his masterpiece.
In a sense that Mr Painter makes
abundantly clear, Proust had done his
living by 1904 when his mother died.
The last years of his life are the years
of his work, his friends, of his struggle
to find the meaning of existence and to
transfix time’s transformations.
Proust’s is one of the most incredible
lives of the great figures of the century:
he combines the political interests of a
Yeats, the isolation in his cork-lined
room of a Rilke at Muzot, the scientific
interests of a Freud. An incurable asth-
matic, living a weird nocturnal existence,
Proust was a person of astonishing intel-
lectual courage and stamina. He was in
touch with all the major and minor events
of his time from the Dreyfus case
MARCEL PROUST
to the lesser political and sexual scan-
dals of the epoch, from the beginnings
of aviation to the work of Picasso and
Stravinsky and the early novels of Al-
dous Huxley. Nothing escaped his atten-
tion. It is one of the many virtues of Mr
Painter’s biography to make us realise
just how utterly modern the great writ-
ers of the past have always been.
And yet, wide as his own interests
were, Proust always worked in concen-
tration and depth. His was the world
of the great luxury hotel, the society
drawing-room, the expensive restaurant:
only in these places did he feel at ease
and at home. Like Pope, he could trans-
form the trivia of the tea party, the dross
of chatter and gossip into the gold of art.
(But he saw significance everywhere.) He
histrionically enjoyed the theatricality
of such places.
Proust, in fact, challenges most of .he
ready-made formulae and dogmas that
are used as passports in the literary
critical world today: he is not obviously
life-giving (writers as widely
different as D. H. Lawrence,
Claudel and Valery disliked his
work); if you wish to, you can
accuse him of desperate aes-
theticism; a profoundly moral
writer, he challenges all that
the moralists stand for. Proust
knew that the best way to kill
the lily is to clean the pond,
that filth and fertility are in-
separable.
He also knew that it is often
necessary for the developing
writer to bite the hands that feed him
and much of Mr Painter’s volume is
devoted to showing how Proust in fact
did just this. His patient 54 years of
absorption in Ruskin, which resulted in
the two major translations of “The Bible
of Amiens” and “Sesame and Lilies”
and the final unequivocal rejection of
Ruskin’s moralism, proved a mysterious
preparation for his own work. The pre-
faces to these works show that he was
already coming into possession of the
unique style of “A la Recherche”. Proust
was slowly throwing off the influence of
other writers and moving into an un-
known world where he had no need of
models and where he could never be
imitated.
This need to be free of influences ex-
plains, too, the brilliant spate of parodies
that Proust produced at this time. As
Mr Painter expresses it; “There comes a
time in the ascent of a great writer when,
for the sake of his own future work, he
must cease to admire his greatest pre-
decessors from a position of inferiority.
Proust was now reaching the heights
from which other summits appeared level
with or lower than his own. His parodies
were an antidote against the toxins of
admiration”. And along with these paro-
dies went the brilliant indictment of
Sainte-Beuve (first published in 1954),
whose method Proust condemned in a
now famous formula: “A book is the
product of a different self from the one
we manifest in our habits, in society,
in our vices. If we mean to try to under-
stand this self it is only in our inmost
depths, by endeavoring to reconstruct
it there, that the quest can be achieved”.
Proust’s vision of the two selves of
course explains how he himself “in the
apparently sterile persons and places of
his external life was able to find the
hidden, universal meanings which are the
themes of his book; and reveal the drama
of the contrast and interaction between
his daily existence and his incommen-
surabfy deeper life as a creator.”
In 1909 Proust had the first intima-
tions of the famous tea and madeleine
incident; his constant search for a reality
beyond exterior reality was about to be
rewarded. And then in the first weeks of
July, 1909, he starts to write “A la
Recherche” after sixty sleepless hours
probably caused by the first wave of
inspiration on which his great novel was
launched. As Mr Painter says, it was
the most important single event of
Proust’s life, both for himself and for
posterity. He set out to map the desert
of experience and to show that it leads,
except for those who stay in it, to the
recovery of innocence, that the joy of
our vision is not cancelled by the disil-
lusion of its attainment, that the fruit
of salvation everywhere underlies the
truth of sin and despair. Proust had en-
tered into time iegained.
It is impossible to do justice to the
scope and range of Mr Painter’s bio-
graphy in a short review. His account of
Proust’s intellectual and artistic develop-
ment through the progress of his work
is masterly. Everywhere he brings new
details to bear on facts and situations
whether the original rejection of “Du
Cote de Chez Swann” by Gide and the
NRF (isn’t it time someone published a
dictionary of the original rejections, mis-
representations and failures of critical
responses in front of masterpieces?), the
history of the theme of the Vinteuil
sonata, the models of Albertine and St
Loup, or on Proust’s friendships with
Agostinelli, Paul Morand and the Schiffs.
The whole background from 1903 to
1922, from the first visits of Diaghilev
and the Russian ballet to Paris, through
the Great War to the mad ’twenties, is
sketched in rich and vivid detail. There
are marvellous scenes of Proust at the


Ritz with his overwhelming extravagance
and moments of absurdity, and a full
account of the original of Jupien’s broth-
el. The portrait of Robert de Montes-
quiou, one of the models for the Baron
de Charlus, is completed with unerring
deftness. Mr Painter is sensible, frank
and completely unsensational about the
period of moral abasement Proust went
through in, 1917-1919, whose causes we
can only obscurely guess But some of
the details would suggest that Proust at
this time came as close to madness as a
sane person can, and in fact recall a
similar crisis in D. H. Lawrence’s life
during his Mexico years.
Mr Painter is splendid on Proust’s
English influences, his admiration for
George Eliot and Thomas Hardy; and
he quotes from Henry James’ magnifi-
cent letter to Proust where he tells him
that “Du Cote de Chez Swann” is the
greatest French novel since “La Char-
treuse de Parme”. It sometimes takes
genius to recognise genius, and James’
support of Proust at this crucial stage
of his career will always stand to his
honor.
Proust once told Curtius: “We must
never be afraid to go too far, for truth
lies beyond”; and he always referred to
himself as a moral poet. In going too
far Proust joined the great revolutionaries
like Pope and Wagner who imposed a
style and a vision which wholly trans-
formed the arts they worked in; by de-
voting himself exclusively to the inner
values of his art he became one of the
greatest moral poets this century has
known.
Clubland’s Anti-heroes
By R. M. WILDING
The Looking Glass War. John le Carre.
Heinemann. 235. 6d.
Tt’s interesting to consider the sociology
*■ of the crime novel. Sherlock Holmes
was so much part of the secure late Vic-
torian and Edwardian world not just
because he “lived” in it but because
he supported its values. He preserved
society from the ravages of the anti-
social, the criminal, the evil. You find
this even more in the novels of the
’twenties and ’thirties, with the detec-
tives (professional policemen or ama-
teurs and gentlemen) always solving the
murder and preserving the English coun-
try house. The middle-class values are
firmly maintained by Agatha Christie
and Dorothy L. Sayers.
With Chandler’s American private-eye
Marlowe we’re in a very different world,
though. Here it’s not clear who repre-
sents the values of society; the police
certainly don’t. They’re as crooked as the
crooks. And though Marlowe himself is
generally moral, according to his own
lights, he’s a lone figure in a violent
big-city world. There’s none of the se-
curity that Dr Watson suggested well-
bred homeliness; nor is there the bril-
liant deductive skill of the protecting
Holmes. Marlowe gets battered around
and is nearly as often stupid as wise.
The English thriller followed the pat-
tern of the English detective story. The
heroes were solidly middle class, up-
right, decent. John Buchan set the tone
with the sort of attitude that John le
Carre quotes from him in “The Looking
Glass War” “There are some things
that no one has a right to ask of any
white man”.
Le Carre follows the English tradition.
He’ s an Oxford man after all, and taught
at Eton. And so, in best English fashion,
characters and districts are placed social-
ly. The officials of the two rival intelli-
gence organisations have their clubs, the
courier who gets killed at the opening
of the book is trying terribly to be old
school tie and regimental. And the agent
who is trained and sent into East Ger-
many is'a Pole trying desperately to be
English, insulted when a pimp offers him
a girl who “likes foreigners”. It’s be-
cause of his desire to be accepted by
the English, by the wartime intelligence
unit that once used him, that he. goes
over the border.
Le Carre has all the Buchanesque
props. Good wine, an Oxford house in
which to train the spy, the “all boys to-
gether and keep the women out” —these
are integral to the book but, as be-
fits the looking-glass war, they are used
differently from the tradition. The club-
man-snob, wartime-nostalgia mixture is
there to create an atmosphere of shabby
English seediness. Leclerc is running his
spy outfit as if the old days of boys’
adventure spying still existed; but the
JOHN LE CARRE
values of that world have gone; and
World War 11, when they were all chaps
together, has been ended twenty years.
Leclerc’s outfit tries to relive the war
—even the young man Avery who was
only a boy at the time. Leclerc is happy
with the traditional feud between his
and the other, bigger intelligence or-
ganisation. But it’s a feud that is dis-
astrous, that allows the spy to have only
out-of-date equipment, that sacrifices the
spy for the defeat of Leclerc that had
been planned all the time.
The courier of the opening section
may have been murdered though no
one seems to care. The Pole is used
as a pawn anyway, he’s not English.
The world of the novel is consistently
unpleasant brilliantly evoked though
perhaps too derivative of Graham
Greene. Le Carre has turned over not
only the values but the spy story too
—the ending is obvious from the open-
ing quotation. Yet he maintains sus-
pense absorbingly, as he leads us through
a world far nastier than Philip Mar-
lowe’s. There’s no one admirable here;
and what makes such compulsive read-
ing is the revelation of how unadmirable
the admirable values of the old clubman
thriller now seem to be.
Faces with Thorns
There is a threat. There is a threat in
roses.
Flared throats that suck the light. And
in the sweet
Thin juice of the green stalks, a deadly
potion.
Thorns, thorns ... I see them take my
youth.
Each head, swollen with scent, flares like
a paper
Skull, and the pressing finger finds no
brain.
Only the soft and faintly sucking dark,
Plucking, releasing, like a snapdragon.
Placed in a vase, the stem bent in water,
It dips and rises, knocked by a twilight
wind.
And still disturbs . . . rose, rose, you are
a peril
Of ripeness, the danger of heartless nature.
Look, we look ... we are lost in that
velvet maze,
Labyrinth within labyrinth of red
Petals that you descend to inane darkness.
Your thrusting deadened, weaving fingers
stilled.
Resist the brain, and you can find the
secret.
Face buried in those swarming flowers,
breathe
The death of intellect with every shining
Rose, rose, empty and consuming rose.

Eight Rebellious Playwrights
By DAVID MARTIN
The Theatre of Revolt. Robert Burstein.
Methuen. 5 is.
passion for methodologising art
-*• and literature which has swept
America in our generation is an awesome
thing. It has produced much first-rate
criticism and many half-baked theories,
numberless good ideas but few tenable
generalisations. Never since the Kama
Sutra has there been such an urge for
classification. I sometimes think that of
all the arts those of love and of the
theatre are the least tractable, which is
perhaps why they appeal to the
aetiologist.
Professor Burstein of Columbia
University is one of the best drama
critics in the United States; his know-
ledge is vast and his enthusiasm pro-
digious. He could write informatively
on any major playwright, and his book
is a veritable glory-box of original views
and canny observations. The attempt to
make facts fit theories does not have
to lead to stultification. “The Theatre of
Revolt” is a fine example of how stimu-
lating it can be without the theory
being proved.
The author has taken eight dramatists
(Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov, Shaw,
Brecht, Pirandello, O’Neill and Genet)
and presented them to us as the eight pil-
lars of iconoclasm in the modern theatre.
He is frank about his likes and dislikes;
he regards O’Casey as overrated and finds
himself irresponsive to Sartre and
Anouilh. The old drama of communion,
he claims, is dead, having been replaced,
since Ibsen, by a drama of extremes in
which the writer opposes himself to his
audience. Burstein’s analysis, very in-
geniously, traces the conflicts that result
from this. The opposition is never total
because even an “ultra” like Genet can-
not escape the collective conventions "of
the playhouse. We are shown eight dif-
ferent types of revolt; self-exorcistic in
Strindberg’s case, by “indirection” in
Chekhov’s, self-expressionistic in Ibsen’s,
and so on.
This is an extremely crude summing
up of a rich, subtle and complex argu-
ment. The more honestly Professor
Burstein pursues it the more it falls
down bub the more interesting becomes
his reasoning. To say that Ibsen was
drawn to realism in order to probe
reality for its profounder contradictions
tells us nothing which would not apply
to most dramatists, but then he bril-
liantly explores Ibsen’s personal dilemma
between the messianic and the social
mode. In Shaw he sees a clash between
dramatic poetry (from the quarrel of
Shaw with Shaw) and an anti-poetic
philosophy (Shaw’s quarrel with the
world). Pirandello and Genet yield the
most substantial insights because their
plays are more spiritually autobio-
graphical more in the nature of direct
artistic statements than those of the
others.
In the process of describing how the
revolt of his eight differs from man to
man, Professor Burstein is forced into
endless paradoxes when he tries to relate
individual rebelliousness to a common
anarchic trend. It would be easy to
think of a dozen writers closer to each
other than Genet and Chekhov or Chek-
hov and Brecht. But inasmuch as each
writer is a paradox, too, the approach
is fruitfut. If I understand the critic,
he believes that all eight are deniers and
not affirmers, and that there is a vain
struggle in their work for affirmation.
Chekhov is a social rebel beneath the
placid surface as well as an anti-
feminist, and Brecht is a cosmic anarchist
whose Marxism is a curb on sexual
despair. In Pirandello’s plays within plays
reality is abolished by the immutable
truth of the mask, and in O’Neill art
is only achieved in his later work when
he draws personally valid conclusions
previously smothered under the hortative
ambiguities of his incest plays. Thus the
strength of the book lies in its capacity
to prove that a writer reaches greatness
at the point where his genius overcomes
superimposed “universal” purpose. In
other words, when it faces the purpose-
less, or when genius transcends pessimism
without sublimating it into false affirma-
tion.
Professor Burstein wants to get away
from the old classifications, such as
naturalism, symbolism and the like. Yet
they remain the roost useful, for style
can be grasped and compared. Mood
is too elusive and too amenable to sub-
jective interpretation. I think what the
author is trying to say is that, having
run out of ideals, the romantic tempera-
ment is forced back on a search for
truth per se, but if this is so, why not
begin with Faust? The creative mind is
too oceanic for other than historic
analogies. Has there not always been a
theatre of communion and of revolt,
since Aeschylus and Aristophanes? Has
communion and revolt not co-existed in
every period . . . and in every writer of
importance? Would it not be more fruit-
ful to ask in what way Brecht is a son
of Kleist rather than a step-brother of
Pirandello, or how protest works out
in O’Neill as against in O’Casey, two
writers who at least started from similar
premises? Finally, is it not true that the
modern theatre can hardly be a true
theatre of revolt since there is so little
to revolt against, God no longer being
secure in His heaven?
Because our theatre is fragmentised
there is a great temptation to look for
new unifying headings. It seems to me
that the only common denominator is
the absence of genuine tragedy. Cruelty
and terror rule, as in Webster there
are no more King Lears. The tragic
figure on our stage is the playwright him-
self, raging against his audience (society)
because it has left him nothing meaning-
ful to revolt against. “Art”, says Robert
Burstein, “is the politics of the impos-
sible.” It sounds clever, but when the
morally impossible becomes every day’s
commonplace Oedipus himself ceases to
be tragic and is reduced to the rank of
out-patient in an existential mental health
clinic.

This wagon is a graphic, practical
example of what aluminium bodies
can do for rolling stock; it can in-
crease the efficiency of any goods or
passenger operation!
In the case of this wagon and others
like it, being built by A. E. Goodwin
Ltd. for the New South Wales Govern-
ment Railways, the use of Australuco
aluminium cut the tare weight by one-
third! Hence, a greater load can be
carried. And, there is ample strength
in aluminium to take that extra load.
Of course, there’s more to achieve-
ment than aluminium alone. Achieve-
ment also means Australuco’s years of
experience in research, testing, design,
metallurgical improvements . . . years
of practical application which can be
summed up in two words: know-how.
So, when you add technical skill and
expertise to aluminium’s inherent
qualities (no rust or rot, no mainten-
ance, no painting, corrosion resist-
ance), achievement and performance
are the natural results.
Australuco’s engineers and techni-
cians, backed by the world-wide
experience and knowledge of the
Alcan Group, are able to supply the
latest information about the many
applications of aluminium in all phases
of Australian industry.

Wild Colonial Songs
By M. H. ELLIS
The Songs of the Gold Rush. Edited by
R. A. Dwyer and R. B. Lingenfelter.
California University Press. 28s.
ITlhe Californian songs of ’49 were much
the same in themes as the songs of
Ballarat in ’5l, not to mention those of
Araluen, Lambing Flat and Gympie in
the ’6os: same old doggerel, same old
tunes from contemporary and earlier
popular music-hall hits.
First in the editors’ selections come
crude ballads of hope: “Ho, ho and away
we go, digging up gold in San Francisco”,
on the Pacific Coast; “The Diggings, Ho!
the Diggings, Ha! Shout for the Dig-
gings, shout hurrah!”, in Victoria. Then
follow the several stages of lyricism pic-
turing the discomforts of the voyage or
journey to Eldorado, the hardships and
disillusionment, the curses on the Chinese
race which jumped claims and fouled
waterholes, the moans about hardship
and failure and finally the reminiscences.
The selection of tunes was to some
extent dictated by the nature of the avail-
able musical instruments guitar, brass
and harmonium in California; concer-
tina, accordion and fiddle in Australia.
But the airs to Californian balladry had
one characteristic completely in common
with the Australian exhibits. The pioneer
miner and frontiersman, wherever found,
were lethal to claim-jumpers and poddv-
dodgers; but faced with a tune that suited
their sentiments, they put Jesse James and
Ned Kelly to shame. If composers, such
as Stephen Foster, had had the same
outlook on tune-rustlers as the men of
Tuolumne County had on claim-jumpers,
the roads of the Yuba and Hangtown
would have been furlong-posted with
gibbets exhibiting relics of ’’Old Put”
Stone the Californian equivalent of
Australia’s inimitable Charles Thatcher—
and his kind who had never heard of the
Performing Rights Association. Handel,
Foster, Dibdin they were all fair game
to them. The pity is that they did not
make better use of their booty The Aus-
tralian goldfields product of musical
banditry made that of the Californians
look like the work of beardless amateurs.
Nobody would give a second glance at
“Old Put’s” version of “Ben Bolt” and his
“Sonora fillibuster” who was “shot in the
back while stealing a poor Spanish steer”,
if Brunton Stephen’s “Sweet Alice”
appeared on the scene to contest his
laurels “Sweet Alice, so dusky and
dark, the Warrego gin with a ring through
her nose and teeth like a Moreton Bay
shark.” For a nation that produced on its
Atlantic coast a daring troubadour who
turned the old Regency drinking song
“Anacreon in Heaven” plagiarised
decades before in Australia for patriotic
purposes—into the United States National
Anthem, its Pacific coast made a poor
showing.
The Professionals
Suddenly a dog’s barking doubted
The morning’s calm. A tree took fright;
Its green hair rose at what was shouted
As other dogs along the street
Passed on the cry Beware, Beware
Through the deceitful air
Comes trespasser or postman routed
To doors you meant to close on every
care.
All dogs distrust mankind, they know
Their masters’ fears about the race,
And their profession is to sow
The wind with dread of new disgrace,
Make bristle with Beware, Beware
All the bright lying air,
Cry thief or dustman breaks the peace
Comes humping burdens you may have
to share.
No boundary is pushed so far
That a dog’s premonitions rest,
Survivor of that ancient war
He knows ill-luck can yet contest
Suburban peace, still warns Beware
Of ambush in the air
For men’s designs are never guessed,
The butcher or a killer’s at the door.
Nor in the night do all the lies one
Dreams under lock and key appease
The dogs patrol the faint horizon
To watch the stealthy hours pass,
And on the sky-line shout Beware
Strange stars are seen out here,
Some saboteur or lover flees
And fuse or seed burns on to shock the
air.

Top-heavy Imports
AUSTRALIA’S import figures for August, setting a monthly record of £137.5m.,
are disturbing. The blow was softened slightly by the realisation that there were
22 trading days in August. It makes August look a little better than May, when
£133.6m. was imported in 20 trading days.
But, with exports difficult to sell on
competitive overseas markets, more
attention needs to be paid to what Aus-
tralia can afford by way of imports.
It is claimed that most of the August
imports comprised producer goods and
materials used mainly in manufacture.
Perhaps the month’s high rate could be
excused by asserting that importers were
playing safe prior to the Federal Budget,
ensuring that extra supplies were on the
water before import cuts or import duties
were imposed.
For example, higher duties were con-
sidered likely on car parts, alcoholic
beverages and household furnishings
which might be considered a luxury and
otherwise obtainable locally. Once again,
however, the Federal Government dis-
played a generous attitude towards
imports and did not lower the boom.
Previous import surges have shown
that over-ordering has helped to solve
the imports problem because stocks be-
come top-heavy and difficult to sell. It
is to be hoped the same situation will
arise again that the law of supply and
demand will provide its own balance. If
not, the current rate of imports is un-
comfortable, to say the least.
September may see another month of
fairly heavy imports as a result of pre-
cautionary ordering by those who wanted
to beat any restraints announced in the
Budget. After that, however, the Govern-
ment will need to look very critically at
what comes into the country in terms of
what the nation can afford.
In one sense, the Federal Government
has encouraged further expansionary
activities by its extremely large expen-
diture and defence programme, which
means it is contributing to a larger-than-
usual imports bill. This refers to the
materials imported by private industry
for use in the manufacture of items re-
quired under defence contracts. It does
not refer to the heavy expenditure on
aircraft, ships, and other military equip-
ment.
When considering what the nation
can afford, therefore, a sharp leap in
exports is required to counter-balance
the extra Government spending, with-
out calculating the cost of imports for
the private sector. So, on two counts,
the rising trend of imports calls for some
sensible restraint.
No one wants arbitrary controls and
past experience is a reminder of many
unhappy incidents, anomalies and hard-
ships. Yet there is no doubt that easy
profits are being made out of imports
when it would be of far greater national
value to encourage local production.
Mass production techniques in the
manufacture of spare parts is much
more economical for a large overseas
factory which already has invested
millions in tooling up and can supply
cheaply to dozens of small countries.
But Australia can’t go on for ever relying
on windfall sales of wheat to China to
pay for imports that really should be
manufactured locally.
China, in fact, has already given
notice that she doesn’t like Australia’s
foreign policy and will be buying less
wheat next year.
Capital investment in Australia has
continued to flow at a better rate than
expected and provides a further comfort-
ing offset to the imports bill. But who is
kidding whom? Without this, the Govern-
ment would have been forced to take
steps to protect Australia’s international
reserves. There appeared to be a very
strong inflow of overseas capital during
August. It is obvious that many big
mineral and oil exploration projects al-
ready approved have generated sufficient

capital funds in the pipeline, which are
offsetting the obvious direct capital and
interest controls announced by the US
and the UK.
How long will it last, and how much
fresh capital will be supplied at what
appear to be punitive rates under cur-
rent conditions? If the US relaxes its
capital controls after December, there
will be sighs of relief.
Sticking rigidly to import figures and
what Australia can earn to counter-
balance her expansive imports, it appears
that Australia is going heavily into hock,
despite the reassuring size of the nation’s
overseas reserves of, perhaps, £A7OOm.,
including £622m. of the Reserve Bank
and the working balances of the other
trading banks. Australia isn’t earning
those reserves. They are only part of the
capital lent by overseas groups.

last week. Certainly a mild optimism

naturally manifesting itself more openly

pessimism over the India-Pakistan struggle,
though London clearly must give the
implications of this situation more atten-
tion.

ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Will the Labor Market
Remain Tight?
The role of new income generation
DO far in the current business cycle nobody has seriously challenged the official view
that the labor market will stay tight indefinitely. To do this it would have to
be shown that one or more of the main income generators was under a sufficiently
strong threat at least to deter new job creation to an extent which might deny the
employment of a significant number of the expected additions to the work force
this year.
Admittedly this is a very generalised
way to pose the exercise, because
obviously the degree of tightness cur-
rently varies and will continue to vary
between different types of employment.
I put it this way to emphasise that it
is new income generation which largely
holds the key to the employment situa-
tion (disinvestment of savings also comes
into it), which in the current circum-
stances of the economy is a rough
function of the additions to be expected
in the work force and the new jobs
opening up to absorb them.
Before looking at the prospects for
the income generators, perhaps I should
take note that, in his Budget speech, the
Federal Treasurer said the increase in
the work force this year would be of
the order of 3.5 p.c. compared with
the actual rise of 4.5 p.c. last year. The
difference from last year arises, as he
stated, because there are less unemployed
to absorb and a considerable part of
the so-called fringe labor force has
already taken up work (he was thinking
of married women, oldish people and so
on). Thus to absorb the 3.5 p.c. in-
crease will require considerably fewer
new jobs to be created than last year.
Looked at another way, there will be
fewer additions to the work force to help
ease the tight labor situation should that
persist as expected by the Treasurer.
Consider first the income generators
more directly dependent on overseas in-
fluences. Of these, capital inflow is the
most difficult to predict and its influence
on incomes is not easy to identify or
measure. On the face of it, in the first
two months this year it has held up
remarkably well, considering predictions
earlier this year that the supply from
the US and Britain, our two main
sources, would probably fall off.
Against this we have only the roughest
of guides to the movement of capital
inflow thus far in the current year, that
is, in net apparent capital inflow as
calculated by subtracting the fall (£26.5
million) in overseas funds in July and
August from the deficit (£55.6 million)
in the current balance of payments for
those two months. This gives a figure
of £29.1 million, or an annual rate of
£174.6 million. If this all represented
real capital inflow, it would not be very
far short of last year’s rate of inflow.
On the other hand, obviously it does not.
For quite apart from being merely
a balancing item, including statistical
errors and omissions, there is a high
suspicion that some of it represents
deferred payments for imports. Thus,
at this position I would say that, as an
income generator, the force of capital
inflow is weakening, even if not as much
as might have been expected.
More important, of course, than
capital inflow as an income generator Is
export income. Mr Holt told the
Economic Forum in Melbourne last
week that the Government expected only
a slight fall to £1275 million this year
from last year’s £1296 million, though
this must necessarily be a shot in the
dark. At this stage it is impossible
accurately to predict not only the course
of export prices but also the quantities
of primary produce (which makes up
about four-fifths of exports) likely to be
available for export. That is not to speak
of a variety of other factors, such as
the negotiation of bulk export contracts
of wheat and the severity of competition
in overseas markets for Australian manu-
facturers in a year when some contrac-
tion in world trade in manufactures,
particularly with primary producing
countries, must be discounted.
The estimate of £1275 million for
exports could well prove to be on the
optimistic side. The actual result may
well hinge on whether the present rather
better trend in wool prices continues,
and whether metal prices maintain the
recent improvement which seems to
stem more from war situations in Asia
rather than from general industrial
demand in the big user countries. (The
US, where the five-year-long industrial
buoyancy seems still to be proceeding
unabated, is an exception.)
On wool, however, it must be recog-
nised that the improvement in prices has
yet some way to go before the average
return of last year can be reached. The
official export price index for wool for
July was still I2i p.c. lower than a year
earlier, even after a 2.1 p.c. increase in
that month. Of the metals, even after
the latest rises in lead and zinc, our

biggest minerals exports are well under
the prices at this time last year, while
copper, the export flow of which has
not yet recovered fully from the Mount
Isa shut-down, is well above the price
a year ago. So is wolfram, of which we
are a small exporter.
Some weakening in income generation
from exports would seem to be in
prospect, not only from the likely re-
duction in export income itself but also
because of the more cautious spending
mood of the rural community after last
year’s fall in wool prices and the impact
of drought this year. I would certainly
expect some reduction in fixed invest-
ment, from last year’s high level, on
farms. This would naturally have
multiplying effects on income in general.
While summing up the overall effect
of external influences on income genera-
tion it would be realistic to expect a
weakening. This may be rather more
marginal than might have seemed likely
a few months ago and on present in-
dications seems unlikely to contribute
decisively to easing pressures on resources
in general. The key factors in the
prospect for lowering pressures on re-
sources and tempering income genera-
tion would seem to lie in internal sources,
notably in fixed investment.
Unfortunately, Mr Holt gave a rather
pedestrian review of the outlook for fixed
investment when speaking to the
Economic Forum, suggesting that, apart
from housing, the prospect was for con-
tinued buoyancy. The real question here
is how long this will be sustained. The
ANZ Bank makes the following apposite
remarks on this in its latest review of
business indicators.
Tt says that the June quarter estimates
of capital expenditure by private busi-
ness in Australia showed a continued
high level of investment spending,
although still exhibiting the declining rate
of growth which has become apparent in
the last few quarters. The decline of
2 p.c. in the annual rate of growth
between the March and June quarters is
more particularly evident if expenditure
in the mining industry (which more than
doubled in the June'quarter) is excluded.
Mining development expenditure is not
directly related to the short-run business
cycle, but more to the long-term develop-
ment of the nation. Another discounting
factor in the current high level of invest-
ment spending is the rising cost of per-
forming a given volume of work.
In the June quarter the Bank also
detects a change in the proportions of
spending on buildings and structures by
comparison with spending on other
capital equipment. “Buildings and struc-
tures” shows a sharp increase on the
June quarter, 1964, to June quarter,
1965, basis, by comparison with the
March quarter’s basis, while the reverse
is true of expenditure on “other capital
equipment”.
Although the unchanged rate of com-
pany tax in the recent Budget means
that there is no direct fiscal influence
to depress this current level of invest-
ment, the ANZ thinks there could be
some indirect adverse effect because of
the reduction of final demand, through
the taxing of the individual.
Income generation determined by the
level of industrial production would also
seem to have levelled off. The all
groups’ index of industrial production
compiled by the ANZ declined slightly
in July after several months of improve-
ment. Its index of durable goods pro-
duction moved similarly, while the non-
durable index rose rather more strongly
than the latter to May this year, but has
since dipped slightly.
There is certainly nothing in the latest
figures for retail sales to suggest that in-
dustry is being flooded with orders at
the moment. So it is definitely possible
that we could see a further general
slackening in industrial production. It
could, therefore, turn out that, if excess
income generation is to be the big
problem as projected by the Treasury
this year, the bone will have to be
pointed at the higher level set in the
Budget for Government expenditure. At
any rate that seems to be the opinion
of the ANZ economists.
CROESUS
A Blurred Crystal Ball
Stars in the Southern Cross
TF anybody underrates the industrial might of Melbourne it is not the Federal
Treasurer, Mr Holt, or the Minister for Labor, Mr McMahon. Both Ministers
Obeyed the call of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures to be Aunt Sallys for
the 400 businessmen attending its economic forum in the Southern Cross ballroom
last week.
With these two aspirants for the PM-
ship on the rostrum practically all day,
one might have expected a rather clearer
picture to have emerged of “Australia
Today and Tomorrow”, the subject
under discussion. Unfortunately, while
McMahon was in sparkling form, Holt
was not. For my moneyjhe more down-
to-earth talks by Sir Harold Raggatt,
Victor Carroll and Walter Scott were
better value and at least were not labored
with political superlatives.
Raggatt stole most of the thunder in
predicting an Australia in ten years’ time
producing as much in value of minerals
as of wool, something over £5OO million
worth. Reaching, as he expected, more
than £2OO million, minerals’ exports
would be creeping up on wool and wheat
in the export picture. Where manu-
factures would come in, he did not say.
It was left to one of the other speakers
to predict that manufactured exports
would rise to £3OO million by 1975, so
at least we got from the forum a reason-
ably clear picture of how the exports
structure might well look in ten years’
time.
Highlighting minerals development as
the key to the future, Sir Harold said
that by 1975 we should be self-sufficient
in both tin and manganese, but more
important than these in the balance-of-
payments equation was to press on more
vigorously with the exploration of
petroleum. Unfortunately he was talk-
ing before the Government announced
it had fixed the price of Australian crude
oil as a measure to stimulate the
development of local oil resources.
It would have been interesting to hear
whether Raggatt thinks this step is an
adequate substitute for his own sugges-
tions for increasing Federal subsidies
and re-examination by the various States
of the conditions pertaining to petroleum
exploration permits. My own view is
that by fixing the price, of local crude
at such an uneconomic level for the
refineries, the big oil groups operating
refineries here could well retreat from
the exploration field. Even local oil
search companies would prefer higher
subsidies in the hand for guaranteed high
prices in the distant bush for oil not yet
found their sore need at present is
for money.
Sir Harold found common ground
with Mr Holt on the desirability of
getting as much international capital as
we could to push on with the big
development tasks ahead in minerals (he
was not leaving out natural gas, which
he thought could produce a new in-
dustrial revolution here and could be
even more momentous than the iron ore
discoveries). There must be strong Aus-
tralian participation in the equity of the
new minerals ventures but, of the £9O
million or so likely to be required for
these in the next few years, he thought
probably only about £5O million could
be found by Australian financial in-
stitutions. The Commonwealth’s control
over the export of minerals was a suf-
ficient safeguard of exploitation against
our national interests. In fact, in his
view, the Government has gone rather
too far in using this control. The ban
on iron ore exports was kept on too


NOW

TO DRINK AUSTRALIAN WHISKY
long, he said, and it was high time the
ban on exports of phosphates was lifted.
With seven hard years at the Treasury
behind him, Mr Holt was in a superior
position to warn of the dangers of
making facile economic predictions for
a country highly sensitive to overseas
forces beyond its control. He made a
lot of that without altogether opting out
of the exercise. While not adding much
to the painting, he did assure the manu-
facturers that, whatever else happened,
their tariff wall was secure under the
guard of this Government, despite the
“personal” views of Mr Richard Boyer.
This, politically, was a good place to
make the point. Also, in an amateurish
sort of way, he explained why he thought
they should push on with increasing pro-
ductivity. Such increases would not put
them out of business and he expected
manufacturing industry would get about
a quarter of the expected increase to 5.8
million in the labor force over the next
ten years.
Pricking up our ears when the
Treasurer said he would say something
on the current and immediate economic
prospect, we heard mainly a dull recita-
tion of the latest business statistics, which
this audience would probably have
already studied almost to a man. We
learned that the Budget reasoning was
based on statistics as they stood at the
end of June and that nothing much had
changed in the economy since to upset
the Budget prospectus. There was a
mild apology on the necessity for the
continued tightness of money, yet no
suggestion that it might be relieved. In
fact, the Treasurer spoke of further
liquidity problems on the horizon for
later this year; he did not articulate them
except to say that the Government was
determined not to let diminishing liquidity
be a bar to economic development.
Mr McMahon, whose professed fervor
for raising GNP always fascinates me
and never fails to impress businessmen,
believes, as most of us do, that at least
the present answer is to expand the labor
force. But he put it to the manufacturers
that the Ministry of Labor has found
industry somewhat reluctant fully to
avail itself of existing reservoirs of
potential labor. Aboriginals were one
lot; another was married women. He
said 59,000 of the latter had been taken
on last year and that manufacturers
should woo more of them by adjusting
hours and conditions of work for their
convenience.
Not letting him get away with this,
questioners taxed the Minister on why
women were not admitted to the per-
manent public service, why the Means
Test was applied to working widows, and
why taxation inhibited many married
women from taking jobs. Mr McMahon’s
answers were not reassuring, though the
SIR HAROLD RAGGATT
questions have obviously set him think-
ing.
The politician always, Mr McMahon
was not to fall for the trap set him when
asked what, in view of the undermining
of management in conditions of over-
full employment, would be the ideal level
of unemployment. Somebody had
obviously been following the heated dis-
cussion in the London “Economist” on
that journal’s suggestion that a pool of
unemployed labor should be created
(“any volunteers for the reserve army
of the unemployed?”). Nobody appeared
to be canvassing the possibility of more
than “hard core” unemployment be-
setting the Australian economy and so
assisting to restore the authority of
management (see “Economics Anony-
mous”).
However, at least one of the audience
didn’t fully share the rosy confidence of
the two Ministers on the outlook, sug-
gesting it was high time the Govern-
ment took steps to reduce the mounting
total of invisible debits in the balance of
payments. He was thinking mainly of
outgoings on insurance and freight.
Answered by the Treasurer, we got the
momentous reply that Mr Holt was
strongly in favor of establishing an over-
seas shipping line and believed the
obstacles to it were not insurmountable.
He hoped to see it in his time. This
pronouncement should be a boon to in-
dustrial relations, especially with the
wharfies, who will await action by the
Government with impatience.
Further, the Treasurer thought the
growing maturity of Australian financial
.machinery would ultimately lead to our
assuming a substantial part of our own
insurance risks. He was very sceptical
about how far we could afford to develop
tourism here as a counterweight to our
heavy overseas expenditure on this item
in the balance of payments, a matter
raised in the same question. With so
much for the Government to do, this,
so it seems, is well down on its list of
priorities.
It will be seen from this point-counter-
point that the two Ministers got as good
as they gave from the manufacturers.
But it was left to Mr Carroll at the end
to show that, if the business world was
taking the Government very seriously
indeed, somehow the Government was
not reciprocating. Its annual pow-wows
with business were more like exercises
in public relations than attempts to get
practical business views translated into
Government policy. The Government
was out of date. It should follow the US
line and have business experts in the
administration and “on the line” all the
time. Lord Bowden made the same
observation at this year’s summer school
of the Australian Institute of Political
Science. The day may come, said
Carroll, when somebody in the audience
could find Mr Holt on the line by asking
him what he thought about putting on a
capital gains tax.


THE MAN ON THE LAND
Looking Upon the Vine
Grape expansion in all States
By CELLAR MASTER
'V'OUR oenological scribe is generally fairly light-hearted; a great wine enthusiast,
A chasing nuances of grape and flavor, an inveterate bargain hunter, dedicated to
the last drop, but still, nevertheless, fairly light-hearted. But, every so often, one’s
head must be put down, shoulders must be applied to the wheel, nose to the grind-
stone, fingers extracted, best foot forward in one gorgeous anatomical endeavor. In
short, we are called upon to submit a Work of Reference.
The last article that I wrote discussed
the various discrepancies in grape ton-
nages in South Australia. The story would
be incomplete without a summary of
development in the other States (8.,
Sept. 4).
Seppelts are extending existing win-
eries and purchasing and planting com-
pletely new vineyard areas. Two new
properties, one at Kapoch in south-east-
ern South Australia and the other at
Drumborg in south-western Victoria,
have been purchased basically to aug-
ment the supply of grapes to the Great
Western winery. Kapoch comprises 880
acres of rich, brown, sandy loam over-
lying limestone. It is on this Terra Rossa
type soil that some of the best red
table wines in the world are made, with
emphasis on richness and softness. In
1963 a trial vineyard was started and last
year 50 acres were planted, 30 acres of
Cabernet and 20 acres of Hermitage.
A further 50 acres will be planted dur-
ing the next eighteen months. Drum-
borg in the Shire of Portland, Victoria,
is 470 acres. This land was found be-
cause Great Western, 100 miles away,
is already overtaxed for grape growing
and it has been very difficult to find
suitable land in the area, so Seppelts
looked all over the place for something
similar to Great Western. Because of
quarantine regulations, it had to be in
Victoria. Drumborg was found to be
very close in character to the Arrawatta
vineyard at Great Western, having a red,
brown, volcanic earth, interspersed with
ironstone gravel. The climate is cooler
and the rainfall much higher. The prop-
erty is also on the busy Princes High-
way. Twenty-five acres have been
planted already, comprising 10 acres of
Rhine Riesling, 10 acres of Tokay, and 5
acres of Pinot Blanc This year, it is in-
tended to plant 50 acres of Pinot Blanc
and, of course, this is the grape which
gives the magnificent Great Western
champagne its character. Indeed, it is
the grape of all the great champagnes.
lan Seppelt, chairman of Seppelts and
also chairman cf the Australian Wine
Board, says, “The acquisition of the new
properties and the expansion programme
at Great Western will let us keep pace
with the growing public demand for wine.
Table wine consumption has risen from
one million gallons to three million gal-
lons per annum in just over six years.
It is difficult to see where this trend will
end. The object of our plan is to keep
ahead of the demand for high quality
champagne, red and white table wines.”
As of this moment, Great Western
champagne is still one of the few wines
which is rationed to retailers. The com-
pany has also recently acquired rooted
cuttings from America consisting of Ge-
wurztraminer, Chamin Blanc, Gamay
Beaujolais, Pinot Noir, Sylvaner, Sau-
vignon Vert, White Riesling. Goodies in
store indeed! Karl Seppelt, vineyard
manager of the company, says, “It is in-
teresting to note that Seppelt’s Victorian
expansion programme is the first move
back to the region which was once re-
nowned for quality grape production un-
til disease wiped out most vineyards in
the State. The disease, phylloxera, de-
stroyed vine roots, and caused untold
havoc to grape producers in the early
1900 s.”
Among other Victorian extensions are
those by Mildara. At Irymple, 60 acres
are being developed with Listan, a speci-
ally selected Spanish variety. This is the
only Australian vineyard of this variety
and the first sherry made showed great
promise as a fino. Semilion is also be-
ing planted to make a light, pleasant
table wine. Meanwhile, in other areas,
Nathan and Wyeth are quietly proceeding
With their Chateau Remy vineyard in
Avoca, which will be used, 1 understand,
to make Remy Martin brandy. Eventu-
ally, they will have 46,000 Doradillo
and 29,000 White Hermitage vines in
the ground, nearly half of which have
been planted. And John Brown at Mil-
awa planted 10 acres in the last year of
Cabernet and Rhine Riesling, both for
quality table wine production which he
finds very much in demand.
At Chateau Tahbilk, the new Cabernet
vineyard has been finished and next year
a further four acres of Shiraz will go
in. John Purbrick reports that the de-
mand for the red table wines is high.
In addition to running the sheepish- side
of the property at Tahbilk, he will now
help his father, Eric, in the winery. This
double work, he claims, will mean that
next year they will probably plant him.
John is also delighted about the acquisi-
tion of the new Coq Foulograppe, as
indeed he should be. It’s a thing every-
one should have.
An extremely interesting development
is the Penfold excursion, the subject of
much recent publicity, into the Muswell-
brook area of the Hunter Valley. At
the Dalwood estate near Wybong they
have planted 230 acres since 1962 and
another 50 acres are being planted this
year. Eventually, 500 acres at least will
be under vine and this will practically
double present Hunter production! Suc-
cess of recent tastings in which the new
wines were shown to various panels in
different States has even prompted Pen-
folds to think of expansion beyond this.
Wines shown at these tastings included
Cabernet Sauvignon, Hermitage and
Malbec in the reds and Clare Riesling,
Rhine Riesling, White Shiraz and Blan-
quette in the whites. All wines have tre-
mendous vinosity, that is, grape charac-
ter. They were typical Hunters with some
extra and much is expected from these
wines when they have matured. In ad-
dition to the varieties above, newly im-
ported vines of famous overseas marques
are being promulgated Traminer, Ge-
wurtztraminer, Rhine Riesling, Sylvaner,
Muller Thurgau, Black Pinot, Chardon-
nay, Malbec and Semilion. It seems al-
most unnecessary to add the anticipation
that we wine enthusiasts will share in
waiting for the results of these efforts.
Success of the famous Trameah at re-
cent shows has prompted Penfolds to
develop Minchinbury further. Minchin-
bury is an old vine area, again being
encroached upon by expanding suburbia,
but Penfolds are carefully nurturing the
remainder of the land and are planting
a further 20 acres of Traminer to aug-
ment supplies of this wine. Because
Minchinbury is a phylloxera area, cut-
tings from this vineyard cannot be
utilised in other areas. Therefore Tra-

McWilliams have a two-pronged pro-
gramme in the Hunter Valley and Riv-
erina districts of NSW- The development
in the Hunter emphasises the Pokolbin
area. McWilliams insist that this is the
proven area of the Hunter, producing
superb whites and reds year after year.
They claim there is still plenty of room
in this proven area and, to back this
claim, point to their new extensions. One
hundred acres of volcanic loam soil have
just been purchased. This is especially
suitable for red varieties and both Her-
mitage and Cabernet Sauvignon are be-
ing planted. What the Hunter will do
to the Cabernet interests every wine
lover. Will the distinctive round, soft
Hunter style predominate, or will the
more astringent, firmer tannin quality of
the Cabernet come through? For fur-
ther instalments in this gripping serial,
tune in to our tasting in the next epi-
sode in 1968! Another 100 acres of
land already owned by McWilliams is
being planted for Rieslings. This is a
sandy loam soil which has been found
more suitable for the white wine var-
ieties. Both Hunter Riesling (Semilion)
and Rhine Riesling, are being planted and
experiments made with other varieties.
The winery, Mount Pleasant, already
subject to much improvement, will be
further extended to cope with this in-
creased production.
McWilliams have always been River-
ina enthusiasts and, in fact, a great deal
of their success has been based on pro-
duction in this area, mostly based on
the fortified varieties. Although these are
still greatly emphasised, there is a dra-
matic wind of -change blowing through
the growing vines. Table wines of great
quality are being produced from extensive
new plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon and
Rhine Riesling. The company itself is
doing much of this planting and also
supplying cuttings to growers, the grapes
from which will then be processed by
McWilliams. Already, the initial Caber-
nets have been exhibited at shows with
outstanding success, taking gold medal
after gold medal in the young red
classes. Cabernet, a notoriously shy
bearer in most other areas, producing not
much more than a ton to a ton and a
half per acre, has produced over five
tons per acre in the Riverina and the
wines still win gold medals! There is
some doubt as to whether the wines will
last, as most Cabernets do, for years and
years and years, softening and develop-
ing, but in today’s climate, with wines
being demanded almost as they leave the
fermenting vat, this will probably remain
a hypothetical question for ever.
Wineries are also being expanded in
this area to deal with the increased
production and many thousands of square
feet of storage space in Sydney are be-
ing established to cater for these wines.
Other developments in NSW still
emphasise the Riverina, or Murrumbidgee
Irrigation Area. Here there are 5369 acres
of wine grapes, less than 500 acres of
which are under the ownership of
wineries. Though the types of grapes
grown are outside the direct control of
wineries, there is good liaison between
growers and makers, and planting recom-
mendations are made each year by a com-
mittee composed of winemaker, grape-
grower, and Department representatives.
A thousand acres have been planted since
1961, Semilion, Black Shiraz, White
Shiraz and Paliminos being the most
popular varieties. The first Cabernet
Sauvignon vines were planted a few years
ago; there is no doubt that- this variety
produces the best quality red wines in
irrigation districts. Still, things are in
development stage with this grape at
present. Currently, the only varieties
which are in short supply in the MIA are
Gordo Blanco and, to a limited extent,
Black Shiraz. If the present rate of plant-
ing on the MIA continues, the vintage
will increase by 200 tons per year and
this would certainly result in some sur-
pluses.
Tn the Hunter Valley, all but about 15
acres are owned by the winemakers.
Apart from the Wybong development of
Penfolds and the intended planting by
McWilliams, expansion is not great,
though productivity has been markedly
increased. Whereas years ago old vine-
yards were allowed like old soldiers to
just fade away, there is an extensive re-
planting programme now in fact over
15 p.c. of the total acreage of the whole
area is new plantings. Lindemans have
replanted 30 acres at their famous Ben
Ean winery and 40 acres of Semilion
have been established at the Sunshine
Vineyard by the Branxton Road. Tul-
lochs have expanded their Fordwich Vine-
yard with Black Shiraz, Semilion, Rhine
Riesling and the traditional Hunter
varieties of Black Shiraz and Semilion
have also been planted by W. Drayton
and Sons at Bellvue, by E. B. Drayton at
Happy Valley, and by Murray Tyrell.
E. B. Drayton is also going ahead with
Rhine Riesling, Mataro and Cabernet
Sauvignon, and Max Lake is also con-
centrating on the latter variety at his
increasingly interesting development,
“Lake’s Folly”.
In Western Australia, Houghtons are
developing their vineyards to emphasise
the production of their white burgundy.
At present, the Swan Valley has 6600
acres of vines planted, equally divided
into three wine grapes, table grapes
and currants. The trend is to replace
the latter variety with wine grapes.
There is still a great deal of discussion
taking place in relation to the Mount
Barker development 30 miles inland and
north of Albany. It is considered that
the land offers tremendous prospects for
production of high class table wines.
Rainfall is around the 30 inches mark,
with consistent useful falls in November
and December. Jack Mann of Houghtons,
never one to leave anyone in doubt about
his opinion, feels that this area must be


developed and stoutly predicts that the
best wines in Australia could be made
there.
It appears, therefore, from these
articles, that the industry is doing much
to improve existing vineyards and develop
new ones. Being a collection of hard-
headed businessmen, though they retain
much of the hospitable and kindly tradi-
tions of the calling, they are not doing
this-as a gay punt at a light-hearted
Ladies’ Day. They firmly believe that
wine has a great future in Australia, that
the consumption of all types will go up,
that the dedication and interest level will
get higher and higher, and in addition
wine will be consumed much more easily
and naturally without pomp and circum-
stance by Mr Everyman. (After all, a
bottle of red from the flagon is now
cheaper than a bottle of beer.) I do, too,
and thought you should know about it.
AGRISEARCH
Lambing on Clover?
T ambing is likely to be lowered when
ewes are mated on lush legume pas-
tures. An infertility rate as high as 47
.per cent has been measured in a flock
at Wagga. These sheep were joined while
grazing a Dwalganup sub. clover pasture.
Another flock on Bacchus Marsh sub,
clover had 30 per cent of its ewes non-
pregnant. In a third flock which was
on a mixed lucerne-medic pasture the
figure was 33 per cent.
Nearly 20 years ago in Western Aus-
tralia, sub. clover pastures were found
to be responsible for severe sexual up-
sets in sheep. These ranged from gross
anatomical deformations of the sexual
organs of ewes and wethers to loss of
fertility. The cause was traced to hor-
mone-like oestrogenic substances normal-
ly present in clover and other legumes.
Sheep grazing these pastures, which were
almost pure stands of clover, gradually
increased their own level of oestrogen
until their sex hormones were in a state
of serious imbalance. More recently, it
has come to be realised that clover graz-
ing at mating time can produce a tem-
porary infertility and a corresponding
loss of lambs. It has also been learned
that some strains of sub. clover are
worse than others in this regard.
Now, Mr N. T. Clark, while station-
ed at the Agricultural Research Institute,
Wagga Wagga, NSW, has compared the
degree of infertility caused by three
different legume pastures the ones
mentioned above. The flocks of ewes
grazed these pastures for two and a half
weeks before joining and throughout the
mating period of six weeks during
October-November. Lambing percentages
were: Dwalganup 74, Bacchus Marsh 90,
and lucerne-medic 93.
Clearly, the Dwalganup pasture had
a much more serious effect than the
others and appears to have reduced the
lamb crop by something like 20 per
cent, on the assumption that the lucerne-
medic had a near-zero influence on fer-
tility. Laboratory techniques subsequent-
ly disclosed that Dwalganup had six
times the potency of Bacchus Marsh.
This considerable difference underlines
the importance of finding and sowing
sub. clovers which have the lowest pos-
sible oestrogenic content. Unfortunately,
the reverse seems to be happening, at
least on the southern slopes and table-
lands of New South Wales where farm-
ers are now tending to favor Marrar
sub. clover when sowing down pastures.
This strain is more oestrogenic than the
ones it is replacing, namely Bacchus
Marsh and Mount Barker.
Meanwhile, the unofficial word from
WA, the original home of clover dis-
ease, is that Dr A. J. Millington and Dr
C. M. Francis have advised the Sheep
Infertility Committee that they have
succeeded in producing some new strains
of sub. clover which are oestrogen-free.
They treated clover seed with chemicals
known as mutagens to bring about the
requisite gene mutation. So far they are
believed to have performed the stand-
ard laboratory estimations of oestro-
genic activity and found it to be ex-
tremely low. However, there is insuf-
ficient seed of the new strains to enable
them to carry out Mr Clark’s type of
practical field measurement. The pro-
ductivity and agronomic features of the
new strains will also have to be ascertain-
ed before it will be known whether and
where they can be used to replacg the
current commercial varieties of sub.
clover.
Until this information is available
farmers should take advantage of any
opportunity to avoid joining ewes while
grazing sub. clover pastures, especially,
of course, of the Dwalganup strain. Of-
ten this will not be possible. The next
best thing is to postpone mating until
the clover has dried off because oestro-
genic potency is highest when clover is
actively growing. At Wagga, when Mr
Clark performed his experiments, the
pastures were already drying off and it
is reasonable to suppose that had his
sheep been joined earlier in the season
the number of non-pregnant ewes would
have been even higher.
Pigs, too, can be similarly affected.
Young sows running on Yarloop sub.
clover have also failed to become preg-
nant. Department of Agriculture veter-
inarians in WA have observed this in
three herds recently. The sows mated
successfully, however, eight weeks after
being changed to a different diet. The
boars do not appear to be affected.
Sheep v Kangaroos
inland Australia sheep
and kangaroos roam the ranges to-
gether. Whether the sheep compete with
the kangaroos or the kangaroos with the
sheep is an argument that has raged for
years hotly at the moment. It will
be settled when certain basic facts are
known, e.g., whether the kangaroos eat
the same plants as the sheep, whether
one of the species is able to derive great-
er value from the food eaten than the
other, and whether one can out-breed
the other. On this last point information
now to hand suggests that both the
Merino and the red kangaroo (macropus
rujus) are pretty evenly matched, but
when things get really tough, as in an
old-man drought, the kangaroos could
forge ahead.
Now it appears from digestibility
studies paid for by the Wool Research
Committee and the Rural Credits Divi-
sion of the Reserve Bank, and carried
out at the University of Melbourne’s
School of Agriculture, kangaroos are bet-
ter able to utilise poor-quality roughage
than sheep. On chopped oaten straw the
kangaroos managed to maintain their
bodyweight, whereas the sheep failed to
do so by a relatively wide margin. And
in this particular experiment the dice
was probably loaded against the kan-
garoos because they were young animals,
but the sheep were mature Corriedales.
This finding is somewhat surprising
because, when it comes to digesting
roughage, ruminants have a natural ad-
vantage over other herbivores. Their
large rumen provides them with a kind
of built-in ensilage pit in which micro-
bial breakdown can go on for days be-
fore the food is passed along to the other
stomachs where the normal digestive pro-
cesses take over. To make up for this
the kangaroo’s through-put is apparently
much higher in the Melbourne
experiments some 30 per cent higher
when an adjustment is made to take
into account the greater size of a sheep.
The evidence is certainly mounting that
from a husbandry point of view kan-
garoo-fanning would be more reward-
ing than sheep-raising in the low rainfall
country.

Educating Australian Managers
Blessed by the Martin Report
By PROFESSOR N. R. WILLS
HOW should Australian managers be educated for their jobs? Who should educate
them? And for that matter, why should they be educated? All of these were
questions raised by the Martin Committee during its enquiry into tertiary education
in Australia. Its conclusions were incorporated in a valuable and illuminating
chapter in the second volume of the committee’s report.
Especially interesting was the report’s
explicit recognition of management and
management education as one of the key
professional areas, to be placed along-
side law, medicine and agriculture. The
committee recognises that there is a
higher education for management and
that it is distinct from the educational
programmes required for admission into
other professions engineering, science,
teaching, and so on. Never before have
we had, in Australia, so clear-cut an ad-
mission that management is itself a pro-
fession for the effective practice of which
there is needed an appropriate education.
So positive a statement of belief must
have come as a shock to those who cling
to the idea that managers are born rather
than made and that “the university of
hard knocks” is the only true place of
learning.
There are yet many in Australia who
affirm the superiority of experience and
who pooh-pooh the advantages of an edu-
cation for their chosen area. Unfortunate-
ly, many of such are not without preju-
dice. Almost to a man they are the ones
who have achieved power and office
without resort to much education, and
who are therefore bound to look upon
their own success as sufficient testimony
to the superiority of practice. It could,
of course, be argued that such men have
succeeded in spite of their lack of educa-
tion rather than because of it. The com-
munity always has enough examples of
successful managers who were not
specifically educated for their calling, to
give comfort to non-believers, but suc-
cess in business is a relative as well as
a changing concept. What was good
enough yesterday may not be good
enough tomorrow. This is as true of
medicine as it is of management.
What of those who have submitted
to a formal educational programme in
management? Do we ever hear mur-
murs of disbelief and denial as to its
utility? The arguments (and perhaps the
prejudices) are all the other way. A for-
mal education in management is essen-
tial, they say. Without it they could never
have performed effectively as managers.
I can only suppose that similar debates
waxed when engineering was emerging
from the workshop, or surgery from the
barber-shop. In Australia many will argue
that management is only now emerging
from its pre-professional stage into a
world where formal education wall have
as significant a part to play as it does
in equipping a lawyer to be in fact a
lawyer, or a medic to be a doctor.
It is in itself a comment on Australia’s
present betwixt-and-betweenness that
such arguments go on. It is a long time
since the debate was heard in the United
States. But it is growing fainter here, as
it no doubt grows fainter in the United
Kingdom. After all, Oxford itself has just
introduced a bachelor’s course in business
administration, and the wwld keeps on
turning. I would hope, indeed I would
expect, the opponents of formal manage-
ment education in Australia increasingly
to see not only the light but the need.
In this country, much will have to be
done, and done quickly, if past omissions

and neglect are to be overcome. It is
much the same in the United Kingdom.
rapid growth of the Australian
economy during the past ten years, and
its continuing expansion, have placed
unprecedented burdens on managers. On
this growth has been superimposed
technological change, greatly enlarged
organisational aggregates, electronic data
processing in office and in plant, full
employment, much more competition
from within the economy and from out-
side it, and new psychological insights
into human behavior. All of these
events have had, and are continuing to
have, a major impact on management.
The time-honored ways no longer seem
to get the results; new methods have
to be learned , rid appdied: and all of
this within a framework where time is
the scarcest resource of all.
ITntil 1939 it can be said Australia had
no specific resources for the teach-
ing of management. Managers came up
through and from the ranks or were
appointed by a kind of divine right of
ownership. A few had university de-
grees or diplomas in disciplines other
than management accountancy and
engineering mainly; but these had been
acquired with goals other than manage-
ment in view.
The war revealed Australia’s dearth of
managerial talent, and sparked off edu-
cational programmes leading to the
award of diplomas or certificates at sev-
eral of the technical colleges. Courses
at this level quickly became, and have
remained, popular. Staffing them, how-
ever, has remained an endemic problem.
The war also brought into being the
Australian Institute of Management, a
private body organised on State and
divisional lines. The British Institute of
Management, and the much older
American Management Association, were
its models. The AIM set itself the task
of providing short and specific lecture
courses for those interested in or per-
plexed by the problems of modern man-
agement. Entry to such courses was, and
remains, unrestricted, educationally
speaking; fees are charged, and there are
neither terminal examinations nor
awards. AIM courses in management
have been extended over the years, pro-
viding a most useful extension service
to practising managers and to those who
may one day fill their shoes.
The Australian universities, those bas-
tions of tertiary education, remained
aloof and sceptical until the mid-19505.
When canvassed they tended to express
some doubt about the proposition that a
body of knowledge called management
did in fact exist this in spite of the
fifty years of history at the Harvard Busi-
ness School. Wasn’t it better for a man
to read history or economics or even
engineering (preferably ai honors stand-
ard) as a preparation for the ultimate
role of manager? This, after all, had been
Britain's way of training public adminis-
trators in the heyday of Empire.
But in the mid-'fifties the ice began to
melt. A new breed, sporting masters and
doctors degrees in business, began to
snow up in Australia. These men spoke
a language other than Oxford, Cambridge
and London, and in its vocabulary “busi-
ness” was not a dirty word. In 1956, as
an experiment, the University of Mel-
bourne pioneerect a residential six
weeks’ summer school in business ad-
ministration. The more enlightened or
inquisitive firms sent along 40 or so
fairly senior executives. The first sum-
mer school was a great success; subse-
quent ones have been even more so. In
1963, after eight successful programmes,
the school was fully institutionalised by
placing it under the direct control of
Melbourne’s newly-appointed Professor
of Commerce and Business Administra-
tion, John Willett.
Hard on Melbourne’s heels came the
Australia-scale version of Britain’s Ad-
ministrative Staff College at Henley. The
Australian Administrative Staff College,
with an impressive group of business
sponsors, and a most distinguished first
principal, opened its doors in 1957. Al-
though the emphasis remained on man-
agement and administration, the appeal
was to a rather more senior executive
group. Like the summer school, the staff
college has had a continuing supply of
clients since it began offering residential
courses eight years ago. In addition to
an interesting curriculum and staff, the
college has residential quarters of a stand-
ard to turn other management educators
green with envy.
Of the same genre, and most recent,
is the Institute of Administration at the
University of New South Wales, estab-
lished in 1961 it, too, has had an ever-
growing stream of clients since it offered
its first residential programmes in that
vegr.
ice of indifference having melted in
A the ’fifties, the resultant stream looks
like becoming a torrent in the 19605.
More and more business firms have be-
gun to see the advantages and the long-
run "cost savings to be won from ad-
ministrative and management education.
The belief and the enthusiasm seem to
be contagious. It could be fairly claimed
that the Commonwealth Public Service
and some of its instrumentalities, along
with some of the State Public Services,
were the first to show the way. “In-
company” training programmes are
mushrooming and outside teachers of
management are being brought in to help
with the instruction The consultancies,
too, have played their part. Quite sud-
denly the climate seems to have changed
for the better. Not that anything like
a majority of companies is as yet par-
ticipating; but a majority of the large
ones is, and these, after all, in Australia
at least, are the major determinants of
production and of economic activity in
general.
By 1960 three of Australia’s univer-
sities were at last ready to move into
degree-granting programmes in business
administration. Characteristically, per-

haps, it was the University of New
South Wales that moved first to estab-
lish a chair of business administration
and to create a distinct graduate school.
The foundation professor took up his
post in February, 1961, setting in train
the inevitable sequence of events attend-
ant upon the introduction of a new dis-
cipline into a university.
Melbourne was close behind. The fol-
lowing vear that university appointed its
first professor of commerce and business
administration. Adelaide had, in fact, al-
ready moved and academically speaking
was first in the field, with a masters de-
gree programme in business manage-
ment, although, unlike New South Wales
and Melbourne, made no new appoint-
ments. All three universities were ready
to offer their business and management
programmes in 1963. Lhe University of
New South Wales graduated Australia’s
first two masters of business administra-
tion earlier this year. Harvard graduated
its first masters of business administra-
tion about 1910, which can only be
taken to suggest that we have moved
rather leisurely and late into this field.
Even so we are ahead of Great Britain,
which only now is setting up graduate
schools of business in London and Man-
chester, using several millions of pounds
hastily donated by the business com-
munity.
Australia’s two graduate schools of
business New South Wales and Mel-
bourne have much in common. For
one thing they are both small but grow-
ing Both are at the graduate level, ad-
mitting to their programmes only stu-
dents who have already graduated as
bachelors of engineering, commerce, eco-
nomics, arts, science, and so on. They
combine full-time with part-time instruc-
tion New South Wales will offer, in
1966, a two-year full-time course, in ad-
dition to its three-year part-time course.
Melbourne, on the other hand, insists
on all of its MBA students attending the
university for at least one year on a full-
time basis. The success of full-time pro-
grammes at both universities depends
very materially on the active support of
business. Unless organisations are pre-
pared temporarily to release suitable men
from their ranks and to help support
them financially while they are doing
their masters’ course, the programmes
could fail for lack of a quorum. Mel-
bourne’s experience to date suggests that
this is unlikely, and that Australian
business has already sensed what it can
gain for itself from such programmes.
For a number of years now some of
the larger organisations have been re-
leasing picked men to do masters’ courses
in business at such American universities
as Stanford, Harvard, Columbia, Car-
negie Tech, and Cornell. These experi-
ments have been expensive, to say the
least, so it is to be expected that Aus-
tralian programmes of business will have
many attractive features from the com-
pany point of view.
fjHHE educational features of the three
university programmes are broadly
similar. They have taken heed of the
latest developments in business education,
adapting them to Australia’s conditions
and needs. They emphasise not only the
modern techniques of management but
the social, political and economic en-
vironment of business. The manager of
today is called upon to have a rather
wider appreciation of his environment
than his predecessor, and a wider ap-
preciation also of what social psychology
can teach him about the people with
and through whom he must work. The
modern manager must be alert to what
automatic data processing can do for
him, how it and other devices can
strengthen his decisions. He needs to
know a good deal about mathematical
techniques of analysis in the fields of
marketing, financial management and
production. He must know much more
about organising and planning. Most im-
portant, he must learn how to integrate
his thinking in the framing of company
policies and in the solving of its prob-
lems.
All three programmes emphasise the
case method as a means of presenting
real and simulated business situations to
their students, who in all probability will
be the managers of tomorrow.
The education of Australian managers
is thus well and truly under way at last.
The entry of the universities into the field
has, as it were, confirmed both its sig-
nificance and its intellectual value. Sir
Leslie Martin and his colleagues, at the
official level, have now underwritten all
of these events at the universities,
the institutes of technology, the staff col-
leges, and the institutes of management.
All, says Sir Leslie, are doing valuable
work. If a Spate of rationalisation and of
co-ordination now seems to be called
for, this does not detract from the
worthwhileness of what has and is now
being done.
I might have concluded by stressing
that the continued success of all of these
programmes is up to Australian business
itself. This, though, would have been
ungenerous. Business in this country has
already sensed the need for management
education. The educators have respond-
ed and they have no need to fear any
lack of support. A progressive and well-
educated management is the real key to
greater productivity and a greater
future, and Australians are at last begin-
ning to realise it.

INVESTMENT
Waiting on Tullamarine
Prospects for the Southern Cross
Southern Cross Properties Ltd, pro-
prietor of Melbourne’s Southern
Cross hotel, seems set for a long-awaited
maiden profit in the current year. The
loss in 1964-65 was reduced to £lO,OOO.
This compares with £160,000 in the pre-
vious year and £225,000 in 1962-63. The
hotel is leased to Intercontinental Hotels,
which paid £470,000 in rent for the year,
up from £318,000 previously.
The hotel itself lifted gross operating
profit from £367,000 to £564,000. It is
on this figure that the annual rent bill is
calculated. With indications of a better
gross operating profit in the current year,
the resultant increase in rent may just
help the Southern Cross company turn
the tide.
The improvement was a heartening
one for shareholders. The situation had
seemed so hopeless until the latest year
that the board attempted last October to
have the leasing arrangement with Inter-
continental reviewed. Its aim was to
boost the rent payable as a percentage of
the hotel’s gross operating profit. The
attempts were fruitless, although Inter-
continental agreed to an early repayment
of establishment expenses.
Intercontinental has now decided to
extend another helping hand by taking
up its entitlement of convertible second
debenture stock. The debenture issue, to
raise £322,000 “to ensure liquidity”, is
being offered to shareholders on a pro
rata basis. As a shareholder Interconti-
nental will contribute £lOO,OOO. If the
rest of the Shareholders do not come to
the party (which seems very likely), Inter-
continental has further agreed to take
up the balance, providing certain targets
it sets out are met from time to time.
The fundamental point of the issue is
that it will be increasing the company’s
already burdensome interest bill. Thus,
even if profits do arise in the current year,
the prospects of a dividend have been set
a lin e further away than they already
were Ihe completion of the Tullamarine
jetpori still remains the best hope for
stability in the future.
Out of the Rough
profit of £253,160 earned by
Thiess Holdings Ltd in the latest
year to June goes some of the way to-
wards eliminating the £613,569 debit
balance brought forward in the approp-
riation account after the 1964 loss of
£901,375.
Shareholders can forget dividends for
another couple of years, at this rate of
rehabihtation.
Tax of £163,743 is payable on this
year’s efforts. Depreciation provided by
this civil engineer, coal producer and
motor vehicle distributor reaches the
tremendous sum of £1,959,558 (up
£276,583).
The company’s Snowy Mountains con-
tracts were the source of trouble in
1963-64. Unexpected geological difficul-
ties and unduly wet weather, plus a
shortage of skilled personnel, were fac-
tors beyond the company’s control, but
unfortunately Thiess made the mistake
of tendering at uneconomical levels

where tenders were expected to be

Independent estimates were made then
and £812,378 was provided for esti-
mated losses on the completion of cer-
tain contracts current at 1964 balance
date. Directors now report that the 1965
profit was arrived at after writing off
all losses, and without drawing on the
above-mentioned provision
Current earning rate is 13.0 p.c., fo
compare with the 13.5 p.c. earned in
1962-63 when a £263,624 profit was
made.
Besides the trading profit, a £71,898
capital profit (1964, £114,690) was made
on the sale of assets.
McPhersons* Records
lt/f cPhersons’ shareholders could hardly
ask for more. Profit to June 30 rose
almost 23 p.c. to a record £1,470,000,
after a 25 p.c. sales rise to close on
£3l million. Based in Melbourne, the
company operates as a tool merchant and
engineers’ supplier.
Earning rate on capital increased by
the one-for-ten issue rose from 15.8 to
18.1 p.c. Even on end-of-year capital the
rate still shows an improvement to 16.7
p.c. Moreover, dividend is to be held at
8i p.c. on the higher capital. It remains
more than twice covered.
Providing economic activity continues
unabated, the group should score another
increase in the present year. The par
issue raised £788,000, which was used for
expansion, the full effect of which would
not have been felt until the current year.
New plant was installed last year to
extend productive capacity, which had
been only barely keeping up with
demand.
Paper of Repute
T>eed Paper Products (Holdings)
Ltd, paper and board converter,
turned in a net profit result of £180,310,
up 10 p.c. on 1963-64 year to June, but
not remarkably higher than the first re-
sult published after flotation in April,
1961.
Current earning rate is 23.3 p.c. com-
pared with 35.4 p.c. in 1960-61, when
the aggregate profit was £172,171.
The company made a one-for-two
bonus in June, 1964. Current dividend
rate is 14 p.c., equivalent to 21 p.c.
on pre-bonus capital, compared with the
then distribution of 20 p.c.
Current market price of 18s. (yield-
ing 3.9 p.c.) gives a 12J p.c. increase
in the value of the original investment
at the placement price of 245., disre-
garding brokerage costs.
The inference to be drawn here is that
breeding, alone, will not bring material
success. Reed Paper can trace impressive
lineage from Albert E. Reed and Co. of
England and relations with “the best
people” in Australia (CSR and Edwards
Dunlop). It needs more “get up and go”
qualities.
Durable Dural
T|ural Leeds, Melbourne-I)ased blind
and awning manufacturer, saw a
substantially slower growth rate in the
latest year. Profit rose only 4i p.c. to
£126,000 compared with the 39 p.c.
jump to £121,000 in 1963-64. For the
fourth time in succession dividend will
be 15 p.c. It is more than twice covered
by the earning rate, down from 34.6 to
32.8 p.c. on capital increased by the full
ranking of the 1963-64 one-for-ten
bonus issue.
The very factors which affected the
result should boost profits considerably

in the current year however. During
1964-65 costs were absorbed in connec-
tion with a programme of product
diversification and the establishment of
a new subsidiary, Duraplate Pty Ltd. In
the light of this, the result was a good
one.
In the current year this diversification
should add to profits. In addition, an
extensive marketing programme has
recently been presented to major stores
in Victoria, SA and Tasmania. The
effects of this should also be reflected in
the current year. A third factor will be
the marketing of water purification units
in the US as well as Australia. This has
been under way for some weeks and first
profits should arise soon,- if they are not
on the books already. The 1965-66 year
looks a bright one for Dural Leeds.
Whoa to Waltons
VTational credit retailer Waltons Ltd,
by writing off considerable estab-
lishment expenses for the major Vic-
torian development, was unable to quite
reach the record profit levels of 1963-64
in the latest year to July 31.
Over the year, profits of the NSW
and Queensland operations (where Wal-
tons is well entrenched) rose 16.6 p.c.
A comforting feature is that the greatest
increases were in the second half of the
year.
However, the move into Victoria via
the Bourke Street, Melbourne, store,
two suburban department and eight
homeware stores, reined in the com-
pany’s previously galloping profits.
The net result was a 3.1 p.c. fall to
£1,444,905, certainly nothing to be
ashamed of, but a change of pace from
the annual profit records to which Wal-
tons has made us accustomed.
New earning rate is a satisfactory 20
p.c., giving ample margin for the usual
12? p.c. dividend.
Bad debts write-off, revealed for the
first time, rose from £322,295 to
£343,139.

following several years of virtual stagna-
tion. The group operates in the shipping,

£400,000 in preference shares was issued
to finance a takeover and provide addi-
tional working capital. So far, this extra
cash appears to have done nothing except
put ordinary shareholders in a worse
position. Primarily because of the divi-
dend payable for the first time on these
preferences, the lower profit represents
only 13.2 p.c. on capital compared with
18.3 p.c. in 1963-64. Not a particularly
good cover for the steady 10 p.c.
dividend.
It is to be hoped that the £400,000
raising does something for profits in the
current year. The last figures from the
company which was taken over (1962-63)
showed that it was earning profits of
about £50,000 annually. Some of this
accounted for the profit rise in 1963-64.
About the only bright note for share-
holders at present is the knowledge that
reserves benefited from £45,000 in capi-
tal profits in 1964-65. If only the profit
dip was as temporary as surpluses on the
sale of fixed assets!
Praise from Brack
Oruck Mills’ 51 p.c. profit rise was
** certainly unexpected. The company
is based in Wangaratta as a textile manu-
facturer. At £215,000, profit is the high-
est since 1957-58. Directors have lifted
the dividend from 81 to 10 p.c., at which
level it is better covered than in 1963-64,
Earning rate for 1964-65 rose from 10.9
to 17 p.c.
Although the dividend lift was expected
because of the higher 5 p.c. interim
payout, the interim report gave no inkling
of the vastly improved profit. Directors
merely stated that profit and sales were
higher than in the previous correspond-
ing period. Forward orders were des-
cribed as satisfactory, just as they have
been for the current year.
The result represents a pat on the
back for the Federal Government. Direc-
tors said in the interim report that the
maintenance of employment levels, pro-
duction and sales, and the continued
growth of the company, were directly
related to the Government’s policy on
the development of a strong textile in-
dustry. The 13 p.c. profit rise to £142,000
in 1963-64 was aided by an emergency
tariff introduced in August of that finan-
cial year.

As Australia’s largest manufacturer of arc

The successful search for cost-reducing pro-

for a pooling of the knowledge, experience
and skills of the supplier with those of your
technical and production people.
Arc welding looks simple but it is a com-
plex, ever-developing field. If it is an im-
portant part of your operations, you should
expect your supplier to contribute technical
know-how that helps to solve your problems
and cut your costs.

wool sold on the Australian market was
approximately the same in 1964-65 as
in 1963-64, the average price for greasy
wool dropped by 12.3 d. a lb. to 57.4 d.
a lb. The Australian wool cheque shrank
accordingly from £447m. to £369m.
Elder and Goldsbrough, which han-
dle 27-28 p.c. of total wool receivals,
and whose group turnover is 42-43 p.c.
from wool, might have been expected
to exhibit a strong downturn in group
profits. But in the interim report direc-
tors said profit was being maintained at
the peak levels of 1963-64.
In the event, net profit was up £72,384
to £2,688,587, after providing £98,861
more for tax at £2,516,337, and
£20,563 less for depreciation at
£1,055,801.
The wide scope of Elder-GM ser-
vice, covering produce, tobacco, live-
stock, shipping, travel, merchandise for
primary and secondary industries, land
and property, insurance and finance, has
apparently played its part in the holding
operation. .

61, and this year was no exception. The
current dividend is 8i p.c., including a

Bleak Possibilities
"Doad transport group Blakistons seems
* to be in quite a bit of trouble.
Directors have reported that the company
failed to achieve a profit lift in the latter
half of 1964-65. In fact, losses were in-
curred. Offsetting these against the lower
profit of the first half, it is estimated that
results before tax will just about break
even. The directors did not mention net
results in their report and failed to indi-
cate whether any tax would be payable
for the year. This can only leave share-
holders to assume the worst.
This they will readily do. There is
hardly any other alternative, seeing the
report itself has forced them to take a
sceptical view of what the board reveals.

interim report last March, they can only
conclude that their board is not very
far-sighted.
The interim report emphasised that
sales were well up on the previous period
although profits had suffered. Directors
said positive action was under way to
rectify the “temporary” position. Im-
proved earnings were expected The pro-
fit drop was a result of stoppages and
temporary cost increases, caused by the
then incomplete integration of acquired
businesses.
The encouragement which these state-
ments created has now proved to be base-
less. Unfortunately, directors state, the
corrective steps did not reverse the cost
trend. It would seem to an observer that
the rise in costs has actually accelerated
stoppages were of lesser significance in
the second half and yet this enhancing
factor has not prevented the incurring
of a loss.
MIM Result
rpHE £3,117,727 group profit from
Mount Isa Mines ltd was some
£200,000 better than figures estimated
by the company in April
It was the worst result since 1957-58,
but shareholders may be thankful that
it was still able to cover a steady 10 p.c.
dividend with some margin to spare.
(Earning rate is 13.1 p.c.)
The dividend of £2,382,079, however,
is to be paid from accumulated reserves,
and £3,450,000 is to be appropriated for
capital expenditure and development.
The best result ever was the
£5,929,087 in 1960-61, so the company
has a lot of leeway to make up.
Effects of the disastrous strike during
the financial year to June will still be
felt in 1965-66 through the depletion of
metal stocks.
Striking Advance
Cyoney lead smelter and processor
Consolidated Metal Products Ltd
stepped up its earning rate in the year
to June.
The 84 p.c. advance in profits, from
£134 313 to £246,613, meant an earning
rate of 33.2 p.c. on capital increased late
in the financial year by a one-for-five
premium issue.
Ihe new funds (£202,500) were only
received by June 14, so they contributed
very little to the year’s success. Direc-
tors, though, sounded confident enough
in April, when the issue was announced,
to arrange that the 270,000 10s. shares'
would rank for the final dividend.
Release of the company’s published
accounts will be eagerly anticipated by
investors and observers who will want to
see how this excellent result came about,
how the joint venture in rendering of
animal by-products is faring, and how
far the company has progressed towards
delivering lead and lead products from
stock instead of from production.
More from Moore
jyiELBOURNE engineer and machinery
manufacturer Malcolm Moore In-
dustries Ltd had a buoyant year to June
30, 1965, especially in contrast to the
doldrums of 1961 and 1962.
Profit lifted 12 p.c to £232,506, which
was a return of 14.9 p.c. on steady
capital. Compare this with £98,613 in
1961, when earning rate was 5.4 p.c.
Dividend in the latest year is augmented
by 1 p.c. to 9 p.c.
Tax provision was up £56,750 to
£185,000 and now bears the proper
relation to declared profits. Certain
losses are available to set off against
taxable profits in previous years.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Benefits of a Bank Association
Yet Mercantile Credits must gear capital
Mercantile credits limited has just
announced its result for the 1964/ 65
year and has disclosed a substantial in-
crease in earnings. Despite the large in-
crease in ordinary capital following the
allotment of 5.6 million shares to a sub-
sidiary of the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation in September, 1964,
the earning rate would appear to have
been maintained. Admittedly the shares
issued to the Bank were only paid to
2s. 6d. on allotment, but a call of Is. 3d.
was made on March 1, 1965. The shares
are now fully paid, the last call having
been made on August 16 Paid ordinary
capital will thus be £3.5 million and the
dividend commitment at 121 p.c. will
be £437,500. This amount would have
been covered nearly 1.3 times by last
year’s earnings.
However, such a comparison does not
have much meaning, for not only does
the new issue provide equity funds of
£2.1 million, since the shares were is-
sued at a fifty per cent premium, but it
will allow the company to borrow a
further £14.7 million as the overriding
limitation on liabilities is that they shall
not exceed seven times shareholders’
funds. Provided that future business is
as profitable as that written in the past
and, if the association with the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Bank allows only a
modest reduction in the interest rate
which has to be paid on borrowings, it
seems that it is possible for this new
capital to earn at about 20 p.c. Unfor-
tunately, just to gear the new capital to
the same level as the present capital is
geared will require another £l2 million
of borrowings; on the basis of debenture
and note raisings in recent years, it could
take at least four years to achieve this
gearing and another three years after
that to achieve maximum gearing.
Mercantile Credits has been in exist-
ence for just over thirty years, though
it has only been listed on the Stock
Exchange for half this period. It would
seem that, for a while at least, the
financing of durable consumer goods
was the most important activity, though
the company seems to have been one
of the first finance companies to enter
the leasing field in a big way. It is rather
interesting to note the growth of the
various groups since June 30, 1961:
June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965

Other advances 1764 1902 2872 4755
teosed assets 4404 4870 5145 5868 6774
The figures are net of income to
mature and depreciation on leased assets.
It is fairly clear that the main growth
has been in the field of real estate
financing.
This substantial diversification into
other types of finance seems to have
paid off well in the last three years at
least, for the return on average “out-
standings” has remained consistently
high at around 9.3 p.c. In this instance,'
“outstandings” includes investments and
stocks, and the net profit includes a
figure for gross profit on sales which has
varied downwards from £lOB,OOO to
£91,000. One of the companies acquired
by Mercantile Credits during 1960 was
WA Netting and Wire Company Ltd, of
Perth. This company still seems to be
in business and trading profitably, al-
though another West Australian company
acquired at approximately the same time
has ceased to trade and has been con-
verted into a finance subsidiary. Between
1957 and 1962, Mercantile Credits ac-
quired six companies; two of these were
acquired for their tax losses, which seem
to have amounted to more than £1 mil-
lion Very roughly it would seem that,
in the last three years, about £lOO,OOO
a year has been saved in tax. It will be
interesting to learn whether all tax los-
ses have now been recouped and, if not,
whether they can be offset against profits
in the 1965/66 year and onwards. If full
tax had been payable on the figure of
£870,000 which seems to have been the
amount of net profit before tax for
1964/65, the earning rate would have
been reduced to 16.7 p.c.
However, this is a relatively minor
matter in comparison with the substan-
tial increase in capital that has occur-
red. It seems that the shares issued to
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank are
now fully paid, so the company has the
use of another £350,000. The problem
in the coming year will be the amount
that can be raised in the form of bor-
rowings. During 1964/65, according to
the preliminary statement, net borrow-
ings (other than bank overdraft) increas-
ed by just over £2.3 million. It seems
also that more than £1.5 million of this
increase occurred in the first six months.
Of course, it may be usual for the rais-
ings in the second half of the year to
represent only one-third of the year’s
total, but, even if we assume that another
£2.3 million will be raised during
1965/66, a further increase in outstand-
ings of £5.1 million cannot be expected.
I would assume that the maximum i«-
crease that can be expected in outstand-
ings during 1965/66 would be £3 mil-
lion. If these new outstandings can earn
at the same rate as the average rate for
the existing outstandings, net profit be-
fore tax and interest should increase by
£280,000. The additional borrowings
would take about £160,000 and the Tax
Commissioner about £50,000, leaving
about £70,000.
The issued ordinary capital is now
£3.5 million, so it seems possible that the
earning rate for 1965/66 could fall to
15.4 p.c., even if the conditions for ob-
taining new business remain buoyant.
This means that the shares at around
8s. 9d. are selling at an earnings yield
(based on an estimate of 1965/66 earn-
ings) of 8 p.c.
It becomes a question whether the
share price is likely to suffer in the short
term as a result of a reduction in the
earning rate. The company has had a
good record and there can be no doubt
that it will be able to make full use of
its association with the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Bank. It must also be pointed
out that the present dividend yield is
7.1 p.c., whereas the shares of Mutual
Acceptance, also recently associated
with another “Eastern” bank, the Char-
tered Bank, are now priced to show a
dividend yield of 8.4 p.c.
I would doubt whether the past rec-
ords of the two companies or, indeed,
the future prospects are sufficiently dif-
ferent to make such a wide margin in
the dividend yields.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Overcoming the TV Threat
Revived interest for Amalgamated Holdings
A s Amalgamated Holdings Ltd, a listed
company, is purely an investment
company, examination of its accounts is
not very valuable without a perusal of
those of The Greater Union Organisation
Pty, in which it has a major investment.
GUO (or, as it was known until re-
cently, Greater Union Theatres) has is-
sued capital of £920,000. The whole of
the £500,000 5 p.c. preference capital
is held by Amalgamated, and its ordinary
capital of £420,000 is owned equally by
Amalgamated and The Rank Group, of
England.
Amalgamated shows its investment in
GUO in the accounts at £995,158. This
is a considerable understatement, for not
only does GUO have huge visible re-
serves (capital £668,000, general
£1,144,000, unappropriated profits
£1,640,000, at December 31, 1964, less
intangibles of £539,000), but the major
part of its greatest asset, theatre free-
holds, have never been revalued.
Fixed assets are shown by GUO as
freehold land, buildings and improve-
ments £64,000 at 1932 valuation;
£296,000 at December, 1962 book value;
£4,189,000 at cost Plant, equipment and
fixtures at cost or lower valuation were
£1,600,000; leases and leasehold improve-
ments at cost £lBO,OOO. This gives a
total for fixed assets of £6,330,000, sub-
ject to provisions for depreciation, amor-
tisation, repairs, renewals and obsoles-
cence of £3,445,000, . leaving a net
£2,885,000.
GUO of course operates cinemas
throughout Australia. Since the advent
of television (against which GUO pro-
vided a total of £BOO,OOO out of profits
in the eight years from 1954) cinema
audiences have shrunk severely, neces-
sitating the closure of many suburban
and country theatres.
The GUO net profit, excluding min-
ority interests, and treating TV contin-
gencies as an appropriation or reserve
and not a provision, are shown for the
last 11 years in the following table.
The chairman can now say that “we
have overcome the threat of television”.

The solution for GUO has been the
presentation of quality films for long
runs in city theatres converted to give a
more intimate atmosphere than the plush
and huge theatres had in the heyday
for movie entertainment. Suburban
theatres have survived where a location
serves several districts. Higher entry
prices were another consequence of the
changed climate for film entertainment.
New theatres of compact size are be-
ing built to replace the older and larger
type theatres. The “Rapallo” opened in
Melbourne in December, 1963, the
“Bercy” in July, 1965, and the “George”
in Brisbane this month. The Sydney
“Lyceum” (leasehold) is being recon-
structed after a fire in February, 1964.
GUO is also building next to the “Vic-
tory” Theatre in George Street, Sydney.
The development programme is ex-
pensive, but necessary for the group’s
long-term interests, and gives the com-
pany a growth aspect which it hasn’t
shown for years. Investment in drive-
ins has been increased, as attendances
are encouraging.
Component companies of the Greater
Union group, besides the Greater Union
Organisation Pty, are Union Theatres In-
vestments Ltd, which owns the “State”
Theatre and State Shopping Block, an
increasingly valuable site (Amalgamated
holds all the preference capital of
£130,268); Rank Film Distributors of
Aust. Pty and British Empire Films Pty,
engaged in film distribution (equally
owned by Amalgamated and Rank); Six-
teen Millimetre Aust. Pty, marketing
photographic and optical products,
studio equipment, audio-visual equip-
ment and 16 m.m. and 8 m.m. films
(equally owned by Amalgamated and
Rank); Cinesound Production Pty pro-
ducing films (owned by GUO); National
Theatre Supply Co. of Australasia Pty,
supplying cinema equipment (owned
equally by Amalgamated and Rank); and
Automatic Film Laboratories Pty, which
processes films and is wholly owned by
GUO.
The associated company (in which
GUO has a 25 p.c. interest), Rank
Xerox (Aust.) Pty, made good progress
with its copying machines in the year
to June 30, 1965, but no dividends were
included in GUO’s 1964 accounts.
Merchandising turnover expanded so
that stocks and debtors of GUO rose
significantly. National Theatre Supply
traded higher and more profitably, but
Cinesound Productions had tough com-
petition. The laboratories have taken
over the Eastman color processing plant
to expand color film processing in Aus-
tralia.

calendar year rose from £282,017 to
£363,202, equal to 80.5 p.c. on ordinary
capital, after preference charges of
£25,000. Amalgamated and Rank both
received £80,500 in dividends and
£177,202 went to unappropriated profits.
In June, 1965, GUO declared increased
ordinary dividends of £200,000, half of
which, of course, goes to Amalgamated,
which in turn was able to increase its
pay-out from 10 to 12 p.c. for the last
year to June. This was after criticism
by a shareholder at the 1964 annual
meeting of Amalgamated.
The same shareholder declared at the
1965 meeting that Amalgamated should
revalue its GUO investment and make
a bonus issue, suggesting also the good-
will item should be removed from the
GUO accounts in view of itsmndoubted
assets strength. This brought a rejoinder
from the chairman that while most GU
theatres were built before and during
the depression, it was difficult to cal-
culate their real value. Some, he said,
were worth no more than the land itself.
Perhaps more significantly Mr Rydge
said that GUO had to take the J. Arthur
Rank group into account when discus-
sing accounting procedure.
So while Australian investors have
lately grown enthusiastic about Amal-
gamated’s ss. shares, for their assets
strength and the revival in GUO’s earn-
ings capacity, pushing the price to
14s. 3d. (yield 4.2 p.c.), it would be
foolish to forget that Australian inter-
ests are not the only ones to be con-
sidered by the directorate.

PRESTON MOTORS (HOLDINGS) LTD
A Promising Car Dealer
At current prices around 12s. 6d., the
ss. shares of Preston Motors (Hold-
ings) Ltd appear good buying. As the
accompanying table shows, the price is
fairly low in comparison with what the
shares have generally fetched since 1960.
Yield from the well-covered 15 p.c. divi-
dend is an attractive 6 p.c. and the com-
pany is set for improvement in the year
to December 31. Since the dividend is
the lowest since incorporation in 1956,
the chances of an increase are excellent.
The operating company is one of the
four Melbourne metropolitan distributors
of Holdens. It also handles Chevrolet
and Buick vehicles. The holding company
was registered in June, 1956, to acquire
Preston Motors Pty Ltd. Vehicles sales,
parts and service branches are operating
at 35 sites in the metropolitan area and
there are branches in Albury and Morn-
ington. There are 10 subsidiaries in all.
The 1964 year was a rather unfor-
tunate one for the company. Profit was
the lowest since the £174,000 earned in
1961, following the credit squeeze. With
profit at £230,000, the steady 15 p.c.
dividend was almost twice-covered by the
27.1 p.c. earning rate. In the first half
of the year, profit declined despite in-
creases in the turnover of new and used
vehicles. The main cause was reduced
margins in the used car section, although
the higher incidence of company tax
played its part also.
Reflecting the responsible attitude
which the board has always taken to-
ward shareholders, directors stated in the
interim report that profits would not be
as high as in 1963. Competitive condi-
tions and heavy cost increases continued
in the second half. In the last quarter,
trading was seriously disrupted by the
infamous GMH strike. In addition, nor-
mal tax became payable. In 1963 the
provision was reduced because of a
special allowance on premiums paid for
the acquisition of an annual licence on
the South Melbourne property.
The outlook for 1965 is quite different.

Tax will be charged on a virtually com-
parable basis with last year. Costs,
though far from stable, have not increas-
ed at the same rate and their relative
effect on results will not be felt so em-
phatically. Moreover, in line with other
Holden dealers, the new 1965 Holden
appears to be boosting sales to higher
levels.
In the six months to June 30 last, the
group achieved higher sales qnd profits.
A steady interim dividend of 71 p.c,
was paid for the period. Directors pre-
dicted that the full year’s result would
better that of 1964, adding the usual
proviso that conditions within the indus-
try be maintained.
Certain other factors add to 1965 pros-
pects. New sales and service premises
were opened at Footscray in November
of last year. Results from Footscray
have been satisfactory so far. In addi-
tion, majoi extensions were completed
some time ago at Dandenong and new
premises are operating in Albury. And
it must also be remembered that sales
in the current half will not suffer from
stock shortages, which hampered initial
trading in the six months to June.
More than anything, the generous
nature which the board has displayed to
shareholders makes the shares w'orth
buying now. After an initial 15 p.c.
dividend rate was established, 171 p.c.
payouts were maintained between 1957
and 1961, despite the one-for-four
bonus issue in 1960. In 1962 the payout
was raised to 221 p.c. and in 1963
another bonus issue was made this
time on a one-for-tw'o basis. Following
the bonus, dividends over the last two
years have been 15 p.c. Although the
percentage rate has been lowered, the
actual cash received by each shareholder
is the same as that distributed by the
221 p.c. dividend prior to the bonus.
It must not be forgotten that the scrip
still holds a large bonus potential. Earn-
ing rate, although running at the lowest
point since incorporation, is still high
and growing. Reserves are still in excess
of paid capital. A cash issue is also a
possibility if expansionary finance is
needed. However, the lack of any defi-
nite pattern in the company’s issue his-
tory and the adequate supply of working
capital means that buying on the strength
of an issue should only be on a long-
term basis. A higher dividend seems most
likely this year or in 1966. Any lack
of an increase by the end of 1966 may
indicate the imminence of an issue, pro-
viding earning rates have expanded.
The accompanying table shows normal
trends for current assets and current
liabilities, with an overall improvement
in the amount of working capital avail-
able. Fixed assets display a sane and
steady growth trend. Intangibles are
negligible, representing goodwill.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Good Results Lower Prices
Don't wait all the time, though
TjESPITE the many promising company results, Australian stock markets remain
; dull and lifeless. Quite a contrast to the American market (the Dow Jones
index is now 910 and only a few points below the record high earlier this year)
and the Tokyo market (index now 1260, which is some 160 points higher than
a month ago). I make particular mention of this latter market because it’s a type
of one-upmanship in the current world of finance to be familiar with the movements
in Tokyo.
Our own market is such that a good
result by a company often causes the
stock to weaken. The announcement of
a considerably higher profit by Frank
O'Neill dropped the shares by Is. 6d.
to 11s. 6d. Protector did not fare much
better after its record result, as its shares
fell back Is. to 265. My most recent
purchase, Tooheys, produced an im-
pressive 16 p.c. rise in profits and also
gave a dividend increase into the bargain.
Yet the best its shares could do was to
rise 3d.
Because of this market behavior, it
seems that one takes unnecessary risks
by buying before any result is published.
According to this line of thought, my
first purchase of the week, Mount 'lsa,
could be classified as safe. The profit
forecast of £2.9 million made by the
chairman, Mr G. R. Fisher, in April,
turned out to be almost £300,000 less
than the actual profit. A remarkable
performance, considering the seven-and-
a-half-month strike early in the financial
year. The size of the profit was the first
surprise and the ability of the mine to
return so quickly to full production was
another. Production should increase
from 10,000 tons per day to 16,000 tons
per day within a year following the
opening of the new K 57 shaft.
The rise in output comes at a time
when the world copper price is at a very
high level (just about double the 1962
price). While the copper price has held
steady this year, lead and zinc prices
have been easing back. However, as
copper provides the greatest contribution
to total sales, the lower lead and zinc
prices should not greatly affect the
overall profit for the current year. My
purchase of 200 shares was made at
365. 6d.
In spite of my earlier reasoning of
the importance of waiting until the result
was out, my other purchase for the Week
was Concrete Industries. Although no
profit figure for the 1964-65 year has
been given, the recent progress reports
on the North-West Cape have been en-
couraging. The last, by Mr C. J. Doney,
general manager of the Hardeman-
Monier-Hutcherson joint venture, stated
that the project was now only about four
months behind schedule as compared to
an estimated eight months in June. A
“booster” programme implemented in
the last few months has had the desired
effect.
After completion of this contract,
Concrete Industries proposes to concen-
trate on the manufacture of concrete
products. Manufacturing may not be
as spectacular as contracting, but it »
more dependable.
Concrete Industries serves as a goof
example of unnecessary diversificatiot
Between 1959 and 1961 the capital ros
from £1,751,000 to £7,866,000. Eve'
the most able of managements woulj
have had difficulty properly servicin
this increased capital. The capital since,
then has not increased much, yet th;
company still remains basically over
capitalised. At least the new boarc
appears to be moving in the right direc
tion. Besides, the present share price o|
4s. 7d. makes due allowance for this
over-capitalisation.
It was with a feeling of sadness tha!
