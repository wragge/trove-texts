The Red Page
Booksellers
A conference of Australian booksellers
held in Melbourne recently received less
notice from the press than its significance
deserved. The dissemination of knowledge
and the moulding of literary taste are in
the main brought about by the general
reading matter furnished to the public and
not by oral instruction received in school
or lecture room. Australia has yet had few
great publishers; but it has had booksellers
who can be truly said to have played no
mean part in building up the cultural side
of the community. Alexander Peacock told
a deputation recently, that the sole means
he had of improving his stock of knowledge
when a youth was By frequenting second-
hand bookshops at night. Many other men
could say the same thing—which is pro-
bably why all attempts-to apply the early-
closing regulations to second-hand book-
shops have failed. The shrewd founder of
Cole’s Book Arcade made it an open shop,
where readers lounged on scats and listened
to band music free from the attentions of
salesmen. He benefited ultimately by his
policy, but the community at large also
benefited. I know an enthusiastic Shak-
spearean scholar whose first introduction to
the bard was got at the Arcade during an
idle half-hour.
Public libraries are storehouses of know-
ledge of incalculable value to the student
and lover of literature, but with little appeal
to the man in the street. But bookselling
depots set in the midst of bustling activities
make appeal even to the noii-reader.
Attracted by their conspicuous displays of
light literature, he often becomes a “light”
reader, a consumer of magazines and novels.
Even if he stops here he has acquired a
new interest in life that will extend his
sympathies. But with dormant literary fac-
ulties aroused he may become an appre-
ciator of the finer quality of books.
Hence it is a matter of public concern
that evil days have fallen upon the book-
sellers of the Commonwealth. Cole’s Arcade
is upon the market for sale; other firms
are said to be struggling with adversity. The
cause of the decline is set down to the
fierce competition that exists in the “bread
and butter” lines. Emporiums and drapery
firms have found it profitable to buy up
“remainders” of English novels, which,
dumped into this country free of duty, are
retailed at such sensational prices that the
fact that they are unreadable by any per-
son of discernment is overlooked at the time
of purchase. At any rate, in their bright
wrappers they will do 'as presents for one’s
friends. Cheap reprints, gift books and
children’s stories are also lines eagerly
secured by big stores arid sold at cut prices.
Technical and scientific works, philosophic
and general literature are left severely alone
for the genuine booksellers to retail. .These
are the risky and non-profitable lines of
business.
And the booksellers’ remedy? Shaking
the waddy at London publishers until they
agree to retail their wares in Australia only
through booksellers was discussed, but it
was felt that the association was not strong
enough yet to enforce such a demand. Only
a gentle remonstrance is to be sent over-
seas. Nevertheless one good result at least
was achieved. It was decided to boost Aus-
tralian-published books, not from mere pat-
riotism, but because it was realised that the
greater the. demand for the home product
the more independent will booksellers
become of English and American publishers,
who persist in regarding this country as a
dumping-ground for ’ their “remainders” to
the detriment of true bookselling.
JOHN A. BRODY.
The General Plan
There are three fiction prizes given annu-
ally, the winning of any one of which implies
great kudos and pickings, to say nothing
of a good lump of cash in hand. These
are the Femina-Vie Heureuse Prize, the
Hawthornden Prize and the James Tait
Black Memorial Prize. In 1923 one novel
achieved the remarkable feat of picking off
both the Hawthornden and the Black, a
novel called “Lady into Fox,” by David
Garnett. The book puzzled the critics—not
obviously, of course; most of them side-
stepped blandly by saying that this winner
of the two big prizes was so good that it
“defied criticism”—by the strange, vivid for-
mality of its fantastic content. The writer
had got hold of some secret hitherto absent
from style or technique, and could make a
picture hitherto unmade.
The good critic (Garnett is a very good
critic) turned novelist starts off fairly often
with a succes d’ estime, and then fails to
keep it up, for obvious reasons. But “A Man
in the Zoo” followed “Lady into Fox”—
just as strange and in essentials just as
good; and the third book, “The Sailor’s
Return,” showed no falling-off in quality. It
was clear that this was a true thing and not
a shallow patch of inspired expression
brought into momentary being by years of
intensified criticism and absorption of tech-
nique. This was the way this artist saw the
human adventure; and it was a good way,
firm and masterly and new.
So it seems worth while to look at Go
She Must (Chatto and Windus; Dymock’s),
Garnett’s 1927 book. The old English rhyme
of the cuckoo:
In July
He gets ready to fly;
In August
Go he must f
is the derivation of the title; and the lady
who must go is Anne Dunnock, the daughter
of the eccentric vicar of Dry Coulter, a
hamlet in the Fen district. She is mother-
less, 23, beautiful, and emotional. Her en-
vironment of friendless poverty in the house
of a melancholy absorbed father makes her
introspective and forces her really effusive
nature to feed in silence on her thoughts.
The sex-urge impinges on the monotony, and
go she must. To Paris, to the studio of
Richard Sotherby, the Coulter grocer’s son,
who is a painter; she is half in love with
him, as with every personable man at the
moment, but falls wholly in love with Gerald
Grandison, who lives and works with young
Sotherby. They are married, and leave on
an ecstatic honeymoon. She returns with
her adored husband, and at Coulter she
finds her father harmlessly insane and
Sotherby, senior, bankrupt. The picture is
blacked out suddenly upon the vicar’s whis-
pering to her that the birds filling his house
are angels.
If the story can be said to have a theme,
it is the emphasising of a plan of general
life dominating the component parts how-
ever self-willed and definite. But the theme
and “plot” are significant only as co-
ordinating with the style-details of the
technique which makes the poignant picture.
These component parts dominate the whole.
The prose is fascinating. Like all the
good modern prose it makes its effect by
reticence, by a studious 'avoidance of all
eloquence. Only the simplest-commonplace
words are used, expressing direct, and defi-
nite thoughts; yet all the semitones emerge
from this exercise in the modern art of
telling your secrets by leaving them out.
But with this important difference from the
other moderns: the sentences are the old-
fashioned eloquent clausal sentences,
cadenced and melodious as a Gladstone
speech.
The character-work is subversive, too.
Even the modern rules say that the back-
ground shall be undramatic to intensify the
drama of the foreground; it is the static
law of light and shade. But here the gentle,
simple ordinariness of Anne is the whole
foreground. The background is exotic; a
mad mystic saint; a monosexual artist living
in Paris on what his father, a country
grocer who wants a gentleman son, sends
him; and the queer, fascinating, line-of-
least-resistan.ee young Grandison who lives
with the artist. The artist’s charming
mother, his quasi-Napoleonic father, his
precise little sister Rachel —all these are
packed with potential drama compared with
the simple, gentle Anne.
By this further cunning we see the con-
ception as a whole, the glittering, self-
willed compdnent parts all swept into their
natural places by the soft directness of
Anne’s sex-urge. His father being bankrupt,
Richard comes back from unnatural cadging
in Paris to take a couple of portrait com-
missions and make plans to send Rachel to
Newnham—the gentleman-son that his
father wanted (and tried fruitlessly to
make) taking up his father’s burden. Gran-
dison is caught up in the tide of Anne,
finds her fierce sweetness a surpassing won-
der and delight, and kicks away all the rub-
bish of the past in this healthy radiance.
Old Dunnock is safe in his mystic’s sanc-
tuary of angels, his place in the general
plan. Life is tackling the thing now, in
fact, instead of the self-willed humans.
That is a good theme; and the picture
telling it is good. The technique, in mass
and in detail, is supernaturally good. It
would not be surprising if some later Garnett
book managed to hook all three of the big
prizes in one swoop.

Miss Edith Sitwell’s World
Metaphors are swift illuminations. They
come of sudden contact with facts unlooked
for, truths unguessed at. They are the
stars we see when we bump heads with
Reality. And that world which Miss
Edith Sitwell presents to the more perse-
vering of her readers (two lines of hers are
often a week’s puzzle) is a world where the
sun is five-pointed, where the moonlight’s a
budding silver bough, where the bright con-
stellations of Heaven itself are cloves.
Through a world so lit (even her candle-
flames are “tight-bunched gardeners’ posies”)
her puppets walk—old Sir Falk, tall as a
stalk; Prince Absalom and Sir Rotherham
Redde. who “rock on a rocking-horse home
to bed”; Gargotte, the goose-girl (thei’e are
many goose-girls); Queen Venus, “like a
bunch of roses, fat and pink, that splashed
dew closes”; Miss Nettybun, with “a mus-
lin’d moon”; Myhrrhine; King Midas—so
often King Midas.
Besides these “principals” of hers (there
are many others), Miss Sitwell manipulates

Nothing like it in the World
With the completion of a four year development and
building programme, Hudson and Essex each presents an
entirely new line of bodies and an entirely new chassis
that gives new meaning to motor-car performance.
The Sup er-Six principle, long held in check, is released
to its full capacity.
That required chassis specially designed to permit full
expression of its wider, more flexible and nimble power.
It meant greater roadability; and a driving and riding ease
not heretofore known. It meant a reliability and sturdiness
that would meet uninterrupted and sustained performance
at top speed for any period of time.
Riding That is Like Flying.
In both Hudson and Essex you will note at once, and always
remember, an effortless ease in all performance, that can
never be confused with any other car. It is the exclusive
characteristic of the Super-Six principle. Power is so
smoothly delivered in all ranges of performance that you
are scarcely conscious of it. You take the lead at the
getaway, you dart in and around traffic, or you travel all
day at sustained high speed, with only the way you out-
distance others to tell your supremacy. There is no sense
of mechanical effort, no explosive lunge of power, either
in your flashing getaway or in any phase of this flexible
performance.
The bodies are of such variety and beauty as will satisfy
all demands for luxury and exclusiveness as well as comfort
and price advantage.

wigged” trees that hiss like green geese;
where the “gay hosannas of the flowers
sound loud as brass bands”; where “the
unripe snow falls like little tunes on the
virginals.” There the sky is “swan-
bosomed”; the rain drops are “long glass
stalactites”; and what with one thing and
another there is a good deal of conversation
going on. The “swan-bosomed” sky says to
King Midas, “All is surface and must die”;
the birds, “as they peck the blackamore
mulberry’s skin,” ask, “Will you accept the
blue muslin?” Noah’s daughter comments
on the fact that
The "Kangaroo chaste
Of Victorian complexion
Wears at her waist
Each pledge of affection.
The trees hiss (to the scullion, baking the
Castle bread): —
AVithout our flesh we cannot see
Oh, give us back Stupidity ;
and II Capitaneo, “swaggart, breggadoceo,”
calls out (to “the jade”): “Come kiss me
harder”—which is about the most sensible
thing anyone says in any of Miss Sitwell’s
published works.
Metaphors, I say, are the stars we see
when we bump heads with Reality. At what
point do these metaphorical creations of
Miss Sitwell’s touch reality? For me, at
every point. For Miss Sitwell’s world be-
witches me. It enchants me. Through her
fantastic imagery is made plain to me an
England scarcely expressed in histories, in
diaries. It is County-family England—the
Tweed-cap country.
It is true that Dean Swift gives us a
picture of it—from below. So does Sir
Thomas Moore’s secretary. Pepys’s gossip
about Hitchinbrook tells us something; so
do Dorothy Osborne’s letters to her lover.
We find reflections of it in the Hicks-Beach
family papers, in Walpole’s letters, Gre-
ville’s diaries; in the records of many great
families. We get glimpses of this world in
Sir Philip Sidney’s “Arcadia”; but he was
of the Court. In Lady Dorset’s quaintly
worded confidences, too, about her bed and
board. Lord Byron knew its ballrooms—
but nothing of “its hovels without fire or
air.” Jane Austen’s match-making eyes
peeped at it over her vicarage wall; in her
“Semi-detached Couple” the Honorable
Emily Eden supplies us with echoes from
its servants’ halls—oh, that world is clearly
there. But we get it piecemeal; no one
has shown us that world, experienced from
within, as Miss Sitwell shows it to us.
In an essay she quotes Blake as saying:
“Man has no body distinct from his soul,
for that called body is a portion of soul
discerned by the five senses.” Elsewhere she
says, “We know that every sight, touch,
sound, smell, of the world we live in, has
its meaning is the result of a spiritual
state.” Miss Sitwell makes poems of these
spiritual states. She sings the swan-song
of her caste and class, and in so doing rises
(as often as we deserve) to the level of
great verse. Could the opening lines of Troy
Park be bettered?:—
The goat-foot satyr waves were sighing
strangely
Of unseen beauty: at the hot sand’s edge
Anchored by waters like the sound of flutes
Our nurses sat: it seemed, I thought, they
listened.
And they were black with shade, and so we
named
Them Asia, Africa, and still they seem
Each like a continent with flowers and
fruits
Unknown to us. ...
It is Miss Sitwell’s poetry that is like
“a continent with flowers and fruits un-
known to us”; and though some critics
doubt whether it is worth exploring, I
do not.

A.J.A. and the Writer
In “Status for the Author” (R.P.
7/7/’27), Louis Esson says, commenting on
the work of the A.J.A.: “But it has done
nothing for the writer as distinct from the
journalist—the short-story writer, for in-
stance, and the writer of verse. He is still
an outsider, who has to accept any condi-
tions, as his work is not regarded as neces-
sary.” I protest that the A.J.A. has done
something for the writer—and without much
assistance from the writer himself. It has,
for instance, secured agreements with the
leading Australian weekly and other peri-
odicals, laying down a minimum payment
for verse and other contributed matter—
agreements which have made a distinct
forward step in payments to the Australian
writer.
Mr. Esson adds that the writer is “still
an outsider.” Some years ago the A.J.A.
created an Authors’ Section, which promised
well; but the authors withdrew themselves
and the section languished. Among the
objects of the section- were set rates for
short stories, verse and articles; syndication
of serials and short stories; payment on
acceptance for all MSS.; amendment of the
copyright law so that copyright may only
be secured in Australia by American publi-
cations when these works are published in
Australia; an investigation of the Australian
publishing trade to discover whether Aus-
tralian publishers and printers are taking
an undue advantage of the tariff on ink,
paper and other printing materials to the
detriment of the Australian writer; the
establishment of a bureau of informa-
tion for writers and those desiring to
place MSS.; and the appointment of
a literary agent. Some good was done
by the l section while it functioned. It
still nominally exists; it would be worth
while recalling it to life. I am willing to
do my share in that work; will Mr. Esson
and others who have written on this sub-
ject do the same?
Might I add that at the present time the
A.J.A. is preparing a statement for sub-
mission to the Federal authorities on the-
copyright question, which is to be discussed
at a Convention at Rome in September?
CHAS. E. SAVERS.
The Australian Composer
Dear Red Page,—Please let me say that
I offered apologies for any inaccuracies in
a Sydney publisher’s statement to me re
Miss May Brahe (3/3/’27). Needless to
say, my statement was made in perfect good
faith after a conversation with the gentle-
man concerned. Would that all Australian
composers had found the path as rosy as
Miss Brahe! In fairness to Allan’s, of
Melbourne, one would also ask permission to
state that no firm has done more than they
to secure whatever little recognition has
come the way of the unfortunate person
whose case I ever plead—the Australian
Composer.—Yours, Keith Barry.
A Satchel of Books
The Murk of Vekel, by Elizabeth York
Miller (Bles). Originality in the mystery
story is welcomed, and a fleeting gleam of it
finds its way into this one.
P.T.0., by Fougasse (Methuen). Draw-
ings from Punch—some now colored. The
Bult,etin never minds confessing that there
are lots of drawings in Punch which it
ought to have printed itself.
Gallows Tor, by Cranstoun Metcalfe
(Bles). A story cast in west-country Eng-
land when “Botany Bay” summed up , the
rustic conception of far-away Australia.
Nothing to excite the blood, or bring a blush
to the cheek of the maiden aunt.
The Peep Shore, by Walter Wilkinson
(Bles). In a revolt against city life the
author made a break for the country and
vagabond days. What happened to him and
his show and the many quaint and kindly
folk he met constitute the interest of an
amusing book.
The Grove Edition of the Works of John
Galsworthy (Heinemann). This pocket edi-
tion of his works is named after the author’s
Hampstead home. Two of the 20 volumes are
now published, “The Island Pharisees” and
“The Country House”; and the remainder
will follow. Cheap but clearly printed and
well bound.
Historic Ships, by Rupert Sargent Hol-
land (Fisher Unwin). This brightly-writ-
ten and amply-illustrated volume gives a
retrospect of the famous ships of history.
A section that will greatly interest the
ancient mariners of Australia deals with the
old clippers—the tea ships that packed on
every inch of sail to race across our waters.
Rubies, by Louis Moresby (Ilarrap). With
a new vein of fiction to explore Mrs. Adam
Beck has for the present abandoned the pen-
name of “E. Barrington,” under which she
wrote “The Divine Lady,” “Glorious Apollo”
and other novels, and offers a' story which
carries the reader from Cornwall to far
Burma through a maze of adventures. Tbs
Eastern atmosphere and the picturesque set-
ting of the story are well conveyed.
Rustle of Spring, bv Clare Cameron (Cecil
Palmer). The simple annals of a London
girl, living in a poor quarter, where life
was grey and even the little shops were ugly
and squalid. It tells in a very human way
of petty interests that loomed large in her
life; tells also of pluck and cheeriness even
when the larder ran low. After winter came
the rustle of spring and a wider life opened
out to her.
David Arnot, by Michael Barrington
(Crosby Lockwood). The author has writ-
ten several sound and interesting historical
novels. The present story is cast mainly
in Scotland in the days of Charles 11.,
though opening and closing in Padua, and
tells how David Arnot, “warrior of Christ.”
carried his mission to his own Sootch folk
and met death at the stake for witchcraft.
A dramatic love thread runs through the
sombre but powerful story.
The Princess des Ursins, by Maud Crutt-
well (Dent). The princess was one of the
group of women who by either the front
door or the back took such a prominent part
in European politics at the close of the seven-
teenth and beginning of the eighteenth cen-
tury. She was a friend of Louis XIY. and
rival of Madame de Maintenon, and was prac-
tically dictatress of Spain during the first
part of the reign of the weakling placed
by Louis on its throne. The first complete
life of this extraordinary woman published.
Laughing Truths, by Carl Spitteler (Put-
nam). A translation from the German.
These essays won the commendation of Nietz-
sche as being marked by extraordinarily
thoughtful qualities, a keen sense for the
history and criticism of art and culture, and
instinct with a delightful humor. They cover
a very wide field from “Jeremiah in the
Garden” to “Literary Symphonies.” The
humor alleged to be found in them has suf-
fered in the passage across the Channel.
Otherwise, Nietzsche’s eulogy, if somewhat
surcharged, has truth in it.
Horn and Hound, by 11. A. Bryden
(Methuen). Experiences of more than 50
years with many packs of hounds in various
parts of England. Mr. Bryden is pessimistic
with regard to the future of hunting in the
Old Country. In the next 50 years he antici-
pates that the sound of the horn and the
cry of the hounds will have dimmed to an
echo. “Modern conditions, the rapid growth
of population, the invasion of rural places,
the increase of motor traflic and wire fencing
must all tell inevitably against the future of
hunting in these islands.” A solid book,
packed with information and generously illus-
trated. -
J.L.S. Quarterly. The official organ of
“The Junior Literary Society, Sydney.”
Once a week a bunch of youngsters gather
to discuss prose and poetry. Their ages
range from 16 to 15), but their ambitions
run on into infinity. This is Vol. I. No. I
of their blue-covered little publication. Mrs.
Curlewis (Ethel Turner) is the society's
vice-president, and a contribution by her is
the only one not from the pen of a Junior.
A noticeable feature of the “Quarterly” is
that the proportion of girl contributors far
exceeds that of boys, due perhaps to the
natural fluency which characterises their sex.
The publication is a very creditable baby.
That Dint Dot, by “A Frothblower” (John
Bellows)-. This is not a book of bacchanalian
lyrics but a study in economics, its aims
being (1) to solve the conundrum of how
a shortage of consumer demand and an
inadequacy of consumer income can be
remedied; (2) to put forward practical pro-
posals for satisfying Labor’s aspirations or
bringing peace to industry; (3) to point out
how the development of trade within the
Empire will redound to the advantage of
both Labor and Capital. The obvious is
made plain once more; but the difficulties
are not removed—indeed, they are not all
seen. In this matter of “bringing peace
to industry,” for instance, Australia has
tried many things which in England they
are still only talking about.
China in Reholt; How a Civilisation Be-
came a Nation, by T’ang Leang-Li, B.Se.,
F.E.S. (Noel Douglas, London). Here, in
mellifluous Oxford English, is the Chinese
version. T’ang and his Kuomintang col-
leagues, who form less than 3 p.c. of
the population, have grasped (he fact that
all the world, except China, has arranged
itself along the lines of militant nationalism.
They propose to join the concert. They
planted the seeds of their Western-style
revolution in Canton a few years ago. It
sprouted last October, and, fertilised by Rus-
sian manure and the undying hatred of the
European, it has spread in six months nigh
unto Pekin. When Pekin is occupied the
Bolsheviks will be dismissed, the hatred for-
bidden and the country reorganised along
semi-foreign lines. China has no time for
the dictatorship of the proletariat, Instead
her ancient respect for learning will incline
her to submit cheerfully to the dictatorship
of young English-trained graduates in Derby
hats and large, liorn-rimnied spectacles. Such
are the main features of the philosophy of
T’ang.
Science: Leading and Misleading, by
Arthur Lynch (John Murray). Few Aus-
tralians have had a more varied and adven-
turous life than Arthur Lynch. For some
years past he has, however, seeking less of
trouble and more of ease, become a steady
contributor to the English reviews and maga-
zines. His range is marvellously wide.
Mathematics, relativity, physics, chemistry,
biology, psychology, medicine —all are dis-
cussed and criticised with the liberty of a
freelance pen. Of medicine, one of his own
professions, he has some hard things to say.
“The specialist,” he remarks, “is often a
dangerous type because he sees his ‘special-
ism’ everywhere; and if a man has gained
a name for expertness in any particular
operation, lie is apt to find occasion for that
operation in the most improbable cases.”
On the subject of psychoanalysis he is
equally frank. The great vogue of Freudism,
he believes, “is due to the facility with
which it lends itself to charlatanism, or to
a kind of quackery that borders on, and
sometimes oversteps, the limit of criminal
practice.” Without taking Lynch as the
voice of highest authority, lie may without
hesitation be accepted as the voice of can-
dor—a valorous knight pricking at humbug
wherever he thinks he sees it.
A Florentine Diary (Dent). A transla-
tion from the Italian of Luca Landucci’s
diary from 1450-1516 continued by an anony-
mous writer till 1542. A feature of the
diary, which covers the period of the Italian
renaissance, is the detail it furnishes of the
work and death of Fra Girolamo, better
known as Savonarola. The unfortunate
priest and reformer was put to the rack
and then, with two companions, having been
partially strangled, was burned to death.
The scene depicted in Topham’s picture in
the N. S. Wales National Gallery, “Re-
nouncing the Vanities,” is thus described:
“On the last day of Carnival, after vespers,
troops of boys assembled in the four quarters
of Florence, each quarter having its special
banner.” The troops united and marched
in procession to the church of Santa Maria
del Fiore, “the church being crowded with
men and women, divided, the women on one
side and the men on the other; and there
the offering was made, with such devotion
and tears of holy emotion as was never seen.
It is estimated there were several hundred
florins.. . . Some women gave their veil-
holders, some their silver spoons, kerchiefs,
towels and many other things. All was
given without grudging. It seemed as ff
everyone wished to make an offering to Christ
and His Mother. I have written these things
which are true, and which I saw with my
own eyes, and felt with so much emotion;
and some of my sons were amongst those
blessed and pure-minded troops of boys.”
A little later on the diary has this quaint
entry: “And note this wonder, not a boy
could be kept in bed in the morning, but all
ran to church before their mothers.”

Lament.
No, no! Lift not the bow
I 1 pon the sleeping strings!
Quiet reigns within his violin
Untroubled by our tears.
Wake not the voices four
Thrpugh which, unheard by mortal ears,
The spirit sings
<>f him who is no more!
But wake these others;
Ay, wake them to a mournful strain
Like the slow sob of autumn rain,
As they his sisters were and brothers
Who cometh not again !
The trombone’s plangent tones his loss de-
plore ;
Let them bewail him!
Let not the flute be mute!
Let all the vibrant reeds
According t:o their several creeds
Avail him !
And when the last dread moment comes
Let the long roll of muffled drums
Be eloquent in their lament
For him who is no more!
Here shall the men bareheaded stand;
And women pass them by on either hand
Bearing green-laurelled wreaths which they
have made
Till all be on his coffin laid,
Behind it and before!
And as in silence ’twas begun,
In silence also this be done!
Then shall the word be said
Which giveth peace unto the dead!
But come not near,
Ye who did not love him, living,
Nor strew your shameful roses on his bier!
It will be time for our forgiving
When, before Heaven,
Ye have repented seven times seven.
Meanwhile stand apart, and leave
The stricken to grieve
For him who is no more!

LOUIS LAVATER.
Idling.
Rocking gently in my boat
On a lazy, lustrous sea,
Half asleep and half awake.
Scanty cause have I to gird.
Gird and groan, at Destiny.
Silver gulls and beaky gulls
Wheeling in the radiant air,
Wide of wing and white of breast,
For to-morrow and its needs
Little, little do they care.
Wheeling, gliding o’er my boat,
Surely, surely theirs is bliss—
Bliss unshadowed, bliss supreme;
Living for the day and hour, .
Satisfied with that which is.
Circling, glancing, high and low,
White of breast and wide of wing,
Happy, happy is their lot,
Taking thought of nought to be,
Free of all remembering.
While from yonder shores there come
Fitful airs with perfumed breath,
This I know and this I feel —
Work or worry never yet
Stayed the hands of Age or Death.
Fretting heart and weeping eye,
Toil-worn hand and weary mind,
Unto me seem worlds away,
Idling here at golden noon,
Warmed and soothed by sun and wind.
While my boat upon the tide
Meets the waves with dancing bow,
Toilers all and thinkers all,
This I ask: Could ye but choose,
Would ye not be with me now?

The Northland.
Winter time is summer and the sky is high
and blue
In the golden Northland where the scented
mango trees
Are big bouquets of blossom and alive with
humming bees,
And wattle, bean and bloodwood don flow T ers
of every hue.
The orchids flare like torches in high and
dusky boughs,
Or dance a stately measure to the harping
of the wind—
His high notes are ecstatic, his melodies
most kind;
He shouts his throaty challenge, but whispers
all his vows.
A sweet warm land, the Northland, with
groves of palm and pine,
And hills of gold and cedar, and precious
things galore;
Where cool creeks laugh and bubble down
the mountains to the shore,
And all the sea is silver and all the sands
ashine.
Sea and wind and tree-clad hills—oh,
beauty near divine!
What matter if the great world goes, if
Love and you and I
Live ever in the rose-time beneath a sunny
sky,
Where solitude is loveliness, and solitude
is mine!

Heritage.
The land was gold with ripened grain,
The river through the sun-drenched plain
Twisted its azure, shining course
By orchards hedged with scented gorse;
But she who came from far away
Saw not the glory of the day,
Nor heeded the great, scarlet trees
Wide-branching to the silken seas.
“Alas !” she said, “for I was born
Far from those fields of yellow corn
And these warm sands of golden hue
Lapped by long seas of radiant blue;
I know not clear and shining skies,
Lark-loved, and flecked with dragon-flies,
Those jewels that dart through drowsy noons
To rustling reeds by still lagoons.
“I know no gay or lovely bird
To song of joy and wonder stirred
By morns of pearl and daffodil;
The sunlit green of field and hill,
The gentle, drifting twilight mist
That weaves a veil of amethyst
On wood and vale and dreaming trees
In windless glades—l know not these.
“My loved land is a land of rain,
Of mountain height and barren plain,
A land of surging, angry streams,
A bitter land of broken dreams;
When white the frost lies on the brake,
The black swans leave the frozen lake,
And I may walk at morn alone
Through the bleak land I call my own.
“And deep, soul-deep, there dwells in me
Love of the dark and lonely sea,
Of circling, sullen hills that rise
Remote and black, to pallid skies;
It is not joy, with elate claim,
Nor love, like a clear, conquering flame,
That holds me thus: in bond I go
To grief that I must ever know,
That binds, unheeding time’s assuage,
My heart to my dark heritage.”

Ere I Go North Again.
Ere I go north again, the birds,
In bushland, fern and tree,
Hearing my cautious step no more,
Will have forgotten me.
And I shall miss them one and all,
And long—alas ! in vain—
For the dear woodland folk I love,
Ere I go north again.
Ere I return again, each tree
And shrub and plant and vine
Will bloom anew, but not for me;
Dread harsher touch than mine;
Their scented sprays shall fade and die
In gully, hill and plain,
And ripened berries fall to earth,
Ere I return again.
When I go north again, mayhap
Some shy, wild thing apart
Will hide one deep responsive chord
Within a kindred heart.
And, joyous, greet me from its haunts
On bush-clad slope or plain.
Made happier for a friend’s return—
When 1 go north again.
[ will go north again. Some day,
Some time, the call I’ll hear,
And, waiting still apart, afar,
I’ll read its meaning clear.
The grey days dawn, and pause and go,
The shining dreams remain ;
And ere the last great Trump of all
I shall go north again.

Happy Music.
No grand prelude nor choral rapture breaks
In blinding sound, as when the swollen
sea
Crashes through flooded inlets. A lark
wakes,
In green and fragrant meadows, melody;
And there are happy children in the wood
Laughing, and spring is here and life is good.
Not scintillating mood of high delight,
Nor deep refrain of solemn psalmody;
Only the stars come out on a clear night,
A white remembered road winds quietly
Into the distance. One goes whistling by,
And we are happy, all the world and I.

Irish.
What is it to be Irish? I think it is to be
The prisoner in the level—that drop of
mercury;
What is it to be Irish? Red history has
proved
'Tis to be sorely smitten, ’tis to be greatly
loved!
What is it to be Irish? In faith, it is to be
A leek-green bush all webbed with gold; a
sparkle on the sea;
A spirit crying in the reeds that ring a
magic lake;
A heart for any thorn to pierce; a pride man
cannot break;
A color in the rainbow; a prism in the dew;
A flash of light upon a wing that in the
shadow flew.
Alas! that drop of mercury still to and fro
shall move,
And we be sick for kisses the while we mock
at love!

LANG AND HIS DOG.
"Last week a man, who dinied that the animal was his, was fined for keeping an unregistered dog. The police said that the defendant was followed everywhere by
the do g , and, although he drove it away when interviewed by the police, he had bought meat for it. The magistrate said he had no option but to inflict a fine ”
MR. RANG: "Oh no, Constable, he’s not my dog. I wouldn’t own the brute —would I, old chap?”

“THE HIGHEST WAGES IN THE
WORLD."
With characteristic modesty, N.S.W.
Premier Lang said in Sydney last week that
his Government had “done more for direct
socialism than any Government in the
world.” In Melbourne on the same day the
Federal Council of the Australian Railway-
men’s Union, whose members are all em-
ployed on Government services, appointed
a committee which is “to endeavor to pre-
pare 'the workers in the direction of taking
over and controlling industry, and generally
to do all things necessary to achieve the
objective of organised Labor, the socialisa-
tion of the means of production, distribu-
tion and exchange.” This “objective” has,
of course, been reached in Red Russia. Its
attainment has been followed by persistent
appeals to “capitalist” countries for vast
loans and “credits,” and by a return to the
butchery of political prisoners which marked
the Great Days of the Revolution; but on
these points the railway gentlemen were
silent. Curiously enough, the demand for a
change from the Australian to the Russian
brand of socialism, and Lang’s praise of his
Government’s socialistic activities, coincided
with a frank Labor tribute to one of the
results of individualism in the U.S.A. Mc-
Innes, a unionist member of the Bruce-
Page Mission, told a San Francisco audience
that it was unnecessary for the Americans
to mention that the highest wages in the
world were paid in their country—“the
Mission’s own eyes have discovered the
fact.”
# * * «
The people who pay “the highest wages
in the world” have no use for socialism of
any sort. This feeling is not confined to
wage-payers; the strongest anti-socialist
force in the country, as it is the wealthiest
and most powerful association of employees
on earth, is the American Federation of
Labor. That great organisation regards
Bolshevism as the worker’s worst enemy—
it has steadfastly supported the Washington
Government in its refusal to recognise the
Republic which “socialised” so many millions
of American dollars, in property and loans
—and considers that the people are best
served when Governments stick to their
own job of governing, and do it well. It
rejects class politics equally with “the class
war,” believes in payment by results and
won’t have compulsory arbitration on its
mind. For these reasons it is scorned by
Australian Labor politicians, union secre-
taries, shop stewards and the young men
who write on foreign affairs in A.L.P.
newspapers. But it has something to show
for its abhorred principles; “the highest
wages in the world” is a fact worth all the
rhetoric of these gentry and oceans more.
Nor is American Labor alone in believing
that Australian Labor took the wrong turn-
ing when it went in for what it calls “extend-
ing the economic functions of the State.”
Many Australians share the belief and are
apt to express it forcibly when they dig
into their pockets twice a year to meet the
losses on Government railways, tramways,
steamers, cattle stations, freezers, canneries,
sawmills and scores of other enterprises.
Except for an occasional brickyard, which
can charge what it likes (the Government
being seller and buyer), and a rare hotel
with the only license in a thirsty district,
they are all losses nowadays, and it is
doubtful whether ten millions of income-tax
money sufficed for last year’s debit balances.
The number of unbelievers is added to when
bodies of Government employees put up
their votes for sale or are shifted from
one electorate to another, and when they
go on strike. Strikes, it was said, would
cease when the State became the wage-
payer, but the ugliest and most far-reaching
strikes during the last decade have been
those of the State railwaymen in N. S.
Wales and Queensland and the job-
controllers on the Commonwealth Govern-
ment line of steamers.
* $ * *
Perhaps the fundamental reason why
State socialism has failed in Australia is
that it is an importation from the Con-
tinent of Europe. It doesn’t suit us, just
as British Parliamentarism doesn’t suit the
Latins and Slavs. It calls for a submissive-
ness to authority which is not in our nature.
Australians are 98 per cent. English,
Scotch, Irish and Welsh, and have inherited
the mistrust of Government, the disposi-
tion to resist extensions of its power, the
dislike of Jaeks-in-office and “pannikin
bosses” for which their fathers are cele-
brated. In short, we are anti-socialists by
tradition, tendency and temper. Maybe
socialism will only succeed among peoples
which are used to being kicked. Be that
as it may, it is pitiful to see Australian
Laborites floundering between one form of
compulsory collectivism and another. If
they take it to be their mission to “assist
in the evolution of capitalism into some-
thing higher,” as they put it, they ought to
be doing some thinking on their own
account, instead of slavishly borrowing more
or less mad theories from Europe. Aus-
tralians take kindly to voluntary associa-
tion in the shape of friendly and co-
operative societies, and this feeling could
be built on if Labor had a mind to be-
come self-reliant and constructive. The
“economic functions” of unionism could be
“extended” in ways that would help
unionists, thousands of whom are not getting
a fair return for the substantial fees and
levies they have to pay, especially from
Red organisations. Many union offices
could, with no great difficulty, be con-
verted into distributing depots for pro-
duce purchased in bulk from “co-ops.” in
the country; and certainly many a union
secretary would be better employed in
trying to get cheaper food for the wives
and children of the workers than in dream-
ing about a silly Revolution. The other
parties, Nationalists and Cockies, claim to
be anti-socialist, the Nationalists especially.
If they were so in reality, they would
resist the spread of the thing their orators
denounce, except perhaps extensions of
Government undertakings which can’t be
got rid of, such as railways—though motor-
traction offers an alternative to Government
railway extensions, in some districts at
least. Unfortunately, these parties are too
faint-hearted to practise what they preach.
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU’RE
HUNGRY?
A Royal Commission is to be appointed to
consider amendments of the Federal Con-
stitution. The Government evidently re-
gards amendments as necessary; presumably
also it has an idea what those amendments
are, else how would it know they are neces-
sary? When a man feels hungry he knows
that food is advisable without the aid of a
Royal Commission. But this Government,
lacking the courage of its opinions, or being
obsessed with an idea of orthodox pro-
cedure, doesn’t disclose its views in full, but
proposes to incite third parties to find out
if thev can.
£ * * *
The Commissioners will presumably
be the usual type; that is to say,
men with open and judicial minds
who don’t know that amendments are
necessary, or who possibly think they
aren’t necessary, or who very likely
have never thought on the subject at all.
It will be the business of these appointed
people to collect the views of other people
who have all manner of divergent views
or no particular views at all, and in the
end they may send in a hotchpotch list of
recommendations which are wholly different
from those which the Government has in
its mind. Then it, or some other Govern-
ment, can either drop them or submit them
to Parliament, and in the latter event Par-
liament may adopt them, or adopt a differ-
ent lot, or reject them utterly. In any
case, it doesn’t seem that the Government
will be responsible for anything, which is
probably what it aims at. Finally, the
scheme may go to the electors as the work
of some individuals in whom they take very
little interest; and the electors have a way
of rejecting almost everything, chiefly be-
cause they don’t understand, and therefore
it looks the safest track to follow. Where
it is necessary to get the assent of four
States out of six, as well as the assent of
a majority of the votes recorded in the
gross, rejection is easy. If Ministries would
concentrate on getting enough settlement
into one of the almost vacant Territories
to furnish excuse for making it a full-
blown State, the position would be more
promising, four States out of seven being
easier to capture than four out of six; but
there is very little doing in that line. The
United States (there were then 13 of them)
contrived to amend their Constitution in
11 different places during the first 12 years
of the Union’s existence.
$ sje * *
The Constitution certainly wants various
amendments, and even if the position looks
somewhat hopeless at present the Govern-
ment should take the responsibility of in-
dicating them, and not let an unrepresenta-
tive Royal Commission try its hand on the
job. To begin wilh, the making of new
States, or the making of Territories out of
the waste parts of States, should be a
Federal matter, with certain limitations. If
the Commonwealth succeeds in drifting into
the position of being responsible for the
State debts, and it is tending that way, sub-
division should be all the easier. The duty
of suppressing insurrection should belong
to the Commonwealth, which has some mili-
tary and naval forces, and not rest with
the States, which have none. There is
urgent need for the central authority to
recover certain powers which the High
Court has whittled away; and it wants a
right to check the construction of more
railways with freak gauges on the main-
land and to start a vigorous programme of
gauge unification. To this end it should
cease the construction of freak gauges on
its own account. These are some of the
more important amendments which are
called for, and if the Royal Commission
points them out it may do a little good.
If, on the other hand, it omits the lot and
goes off on wholly different tracks, it will
make the situation worse, should that be
possible. The precedent of Balak, who
hired Balaam for a specific purpose, may
be quoted as an illustration.
* * *
It would be much easier to persuade the
community to vote “Yes” when the Federal
Government asks for extended powers if
it made the utmost possible use of those
it possesses. It has a considerable list of
neglected opportunities, including the all-
pervading matters of marriage and divorce;
and if it took control wherever possible,
there would be more of a tendency to
remember that the Commonwealth exists,
and an increasing inclination to forget that
the States exist. Even to be tried by a
Federal criminal court and put into a
Federal gaol would be helpful. But the
country hasn’t yet produced a central Gov-
ernment with the well-directed thirst for
interference which inspires respect and also
does a great deal to command success.
THREE HUNDRED YEARS HENCE.
The Secretariat of the League of Nations
is doubtless an authority on any subject
that it tackles, being able to command the
services of the pundits, professors and
prophets of 55 States, including Siam, Persia
and Bolivia, so its pronouncements com-
mand respect. A recent one is to the alarm-
ing effect that 300 years hence this world
of ours is likely to contain eight thousand
millions of inhabitants —unless something
is done about it. This number looks a
great deal too large for comfort. Yet it
may easily be an under-statement when
consideration is given to the very remark-
able increase during recent years, in places
where a harried and philanthropic civili-
sation has had a chance to do its best at
reducing the death-rate. It is only neces-
sary for high-class civilisation to get the
power to operate in the same way on all
the world instead of on a fairly extensive
part of it, and the worst may happen. It
may even begin to happen before the next
generation has all gone to its peaceful ere-
matorium, cemeteries being a waste of space.
If the colored or slightly tinted person
is left to himself, or if he only comes under
the influence of an inferior variety of white,
he doesn’t tend to extraordinary multiplica-
tion. India and Java were not left to
themselves, nor was Japan. China is not
exactly evidence, its population being
mostly a matter of guesswork. But cases
in point can be found in Western Asia,
Africa and America. Arabia has been not
much disturbed by invasion and its civil
wars are comparatively harmless, the Arab
being too nervous for much serious fighting.
Yet Mecca and Medina, which were old
when Mohammed moved in those parts,
are only supposed to have 50,000 and 5000
inhabitants respectively. The dead failure
of the Emir Fizzle’s attempt at govern-
ing Damascus has been ascribed to the fact
that he was stunned by the size of the
place. Yet Damascus, though incompar-
ably older than London, isn’t so large as
Perth (W.A.), and shows no definite sign
of having progressed much in a thousand
years—except perhaps backwards —until
Europeans came and built a railway and
some decent hotels. The same might be
said of Jerusalem and many other places
in that neighborhood.
All that remains of Turkey has been sus-
pected of losing population for a very long
while and is a land of uninhabited ruins,
while all that doesn’t remain of Turkey
was similarly suspected while the Unspeak-
able had it. The Turk’s simple method of
government, added to his complicated lack
of sanitation, is generally held responsible.
Much of the official correspondence was,
and presumably still is, after this style:—
Your Excellency.—While unable to say
positively that there are any signs of dis-
affection among the Christian inhabitants of
this villayet of Kara Hissar Sharki, I regret
to state that I am definitely informed such
signs will probably appear about the middle
of next month. Kindly send instructions.—
(Signed) Skunk Bey, Governor.
Your Idiocy,—At your age you ought to
know what to do. Have a massacre immedi-
ately, or tw r o massacres. Have as many mas-
sacres as the urgent nature of the case re-
qqires, in fact. — (Signed) Slaughter
Pasiia, Grand Vizier.
In the proceedings which began under
Abdul Hamid and continued aftemards, the
number of people wiped out in Armenia
alone has been estimated at a million and
a quarter. Thus a great deal of nossible
over-population was anticipated or fore-
stalled.
There is reason to believe that the African
races in the aggregate entered upon a fairly
steady career of. suicide after the early
European civilising influences were pushed
out. Sanitation being a dead letter, ordinary
mortality was naturally high. Then the
continent was spotted with tribes like the
Ashantees who exercised birth control over
great surrounding areas, and carried on war
raids and slave raids and assorted raids
with intense intensity. When a British force
arrived at Coomassie and made an end of
the Ashantee monarchy, it entered holding
its nose by reason of the stench of thousands
of dead bodies which had been carelessly
deposited in a more or less sacred patch of
timber after serving their purpose as human
sacrifices. The Mahdi had only a short
run, but he and his successor emptied a
great, deal of country; and the ephemeral
Zulu State did equally well.
Now there is no part of Africa save
Abyssinia where the aggregate nigges can
commit suicide in absolute peace and with-
out remonstrance, and the white man is
meeting with alarming success in improv-
ing the birth-rate. For instance, Egypt,
which the Turks were once making empty
with their usual vigor, took to doubling
its population in about 33 years under
European management, and in 1917 nine
of its agricultural provinces had over 1000
people (1770 in one instance) to each habit-
able square mile.
American population before the white
man came is guesswork, and some of the
guesses are pretty wild. Some of the white
men who came being rather a poor lot, the
increase isn’t quite so marked, especially in
the south, as it is elsewhere. But in Europe
there is plenty of disquieting material.
England and Wales, after being compara-
tively' torpid in the census line since the
time of, and before, Julius Caesar, started
a spurt about a century ago, and by reason
of sanitary and other improvements, and
despite heavy emigration, it still continues.
If it continues to continue at the rate of
the last hundred years, England and Wales
may expect to have,. roughly, 926 million
inhabitants three centuries hence, which is
one-eighth of the number which the League
of Nations Secretariat anticipates for the
entire globe. I would describe this as a
rousing spectacle. The spectacle of nearly
ten inhabitants to each quarter-acre would
be enough to rouse anybody.
SOLOMON MALAPROP.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Death and the Car.
Last year, in the metropolitan district of
Sydney, 116 persons were killed and 2807
injured by motor vehicles. The year before
there were 89 deaths and 2510 cases of
injury. The increase is out of proportion
to the increase in traffic, and in both years
the percentage of accidents to the number
of vehicles in use has been unduly high
in comparison with the records of other
cities, at home and abroad.
The reasons for the high casualty rate
are fairly obvious. Sydney streets are,


speaking generally, narrow; many of them
are crooked, and there are frequent changes
of grade. At many a busy intersection it
is necessary for motorists to accelerate to
top a rise. To enable the streets to carry
the traffic without congestion vehicles must
be kept moving smartly, and the police
insist upon it. Pedestrians run undue risks
from this fast-moving traffic because so
few “islands” are provided in the streets.
In addition there is the Australian tempera-
ment to be reckoned with. Its most admir-
able parts—good nerve, plenty of pluck,
and a disposition to ignore consequences—
don’t help their possessor to be a carefid
driver. A first taxi trip through Sydney
streets is a hair-raising experience for a
visitor from London, not to speak of less
populous cities. The typical Sydney driver
dodges death by an inch ten times in a
mile. He is over-confident, and the harvest
of over-confidence is a sorry record of death,
damage and disaster. The remedy is as
obvious as the disease. Once the majority
of motorists are made to realise (as a min-
ority, made up of the most intelligent, skil-
ful and experienced drivers, already realise)
that good drivers take no chances, there
will be a big diminution in Sydney’s traffic
casualties. Drivers, too, would have fewer
risks thrust upon them were the traffic bet-
ter regulated, especially in the direction of
giving pedestrians a safety zone in the
centre of busy streets.
The matter is to some extent in the hands
of the motorists themselves; and their
organisations, if they are wise, will use all
the influence they can exert to discourage
dare-devil driving on the public roads and
to encourage the provision of devices to
protect pedestrians. Magistrates and Judges
could help, too, more than they are doing;
but they come in after the event, and pre-
vention is better than punishment.
Room For a Centre Party?
Dear Bulletin, — I agree with Ballantyne
Temple (B. 7/7/’27) that the Country
Party’s first duty is to out all shades of
Red. My point is that, by pacting with
the Nats, in N. S. Wales, the C.P. has lost
its best chance of doing so. As an inde-
pendent entity, with every chance of an
increase in numbers after the election, it
would have been in a position to dictate
terms to whichever of the big parties was
in power. As a mere branch or wing of the
Nats., it won’t. The mouse was in a strong
strategic position so long as the lion was
in the net, but, being fool enough to help
him to get loose, it was more or less the
mouse’s own fault that he was swallowed.
The weaker party in every combine, coali-
tion, fusion, pact or gentlemen’s agreement
is usually swallowed.
There may be, and probably are, distinc-
tions between a pact and a coalition or
fusion that are perfectly clear to its con-
stituents; but to the plain man the common
characteristic is a remarkable readiness to
accept office and to sacrifice principle, and
he judges accordingly. A good many C.P.
supporters cannot draw any very fine dis-
tinction between the actions and motives
of Buttenshaw and those which prompted
Wearne, Ley and Bavin a few years ago
when they pacted with the Nats. As for
the result of the pact, it is true that they
went to the poll as Nationalist-Progressives,
but once the election was safely over even
the name was dropped, and, in the words
of the poet, “Vere is dot barty now?”
Having therefore a strong suspicion that
after the election the C.P. will be indistin-
guishable from the Nats., what is the coun-
try man to do? Like Huxley, he has no
faith and very little hope. He has never
had any consideration from the Nats., and
doesn’t expect any. On the other hand,
even the present Labor Government has
given some attention to country needs—
e.g., the Crown Lands Act of 1927, the
repeal of the Gun Licence Act and the com-
pulsory registration of land agents, all of
which the Nats, could have done and didn’t
do. It is true that we have been afflicted
with Workers’ Compensation, Child Endow-
ment and some other fooleries, but, as we
now learn on the best authority that Bavin
and Co. were really responsible for these,
it is not fair to blame the Government.
And since it is fairly clear that the indus-
trial wing of the Labor party had nothing
to do with the beneficial legislation quoted,
it seems a fair assumption that Mutch’s
crowd can be given the credit, and they
start with so much in their favor.
It has to be remembered that a great
many C.P. voters, small cockies and the
like, are generally on the balance between
C.P. and Labor. The good A.W.U. man
doesn’t change all his spots when he draws
the winning marble in the land ballot. His
point of view may change enough to en-
able him to see that his former friends are
not invariably right, and if there is a C.P.
candidate available he will probably vote
for him as representing his new interests.
To vote Nat. he would have to abandon
all the principles he ever had; and, anyhow,
there is nothing in the party’s policy to
attract him. To endeavor to make these
men Nationalists, whether they like it or
not, is to drive them back into the Labor
fold, and that is where Mutch is going
to score, especially since he has got rid
of the industrial wing. Why it was neces-
sary to give Mutch such a start in life,
when there was a safe refuge in the shape
of the preferential vote, Heaven and the
party leaders alone know, and they won’t
say.—Yours, Fitzwilliam.
The Child Convict.
In the film version of Marcus Clarke’s
“For the Term of His Natural Life,” two
child convicts are shown committing suicide
at Port Arthur. The novelist may have
invented the suicide; but the child con-
victs were no invention. In 1844 there
were in prison in England 11,348 persons
between 10 and 20 years of age, or 1 in 304
of the total population of that age. Five
years later no fewer than 10,703 persons
under 17 were sentenced to imprisonment
or transportation.
Until 1847 practically no steps were taken
to distinguish between punishment for the
mature adult and the immature child. In
that year the seeds of a great reformation
were sown. Courts of Summary Jurisdiction
were given power to try children under
14 for simple! larceny. Prior to that a child
under that ago for stealing what Charley
Bates in “Oliver Twist” described as “a
wipe” would have been tried before a
scarlet-robed Judge and a jury of his adult
countrymen. For stealing articles of very
little greater value, children had been
shipped to Van Diemen’s Land.
From that very humble beginning of
allowing children charged with petty pilfer-
ing to be dealt with by a Bench of Magi-
strates, a host of reforms sprang up. The
infants had been herded in the prisons with
adults, most of them habitual criminals.
They were now segregated and lodged in
separate prisons; reformatories and indus-
trial schools were established; the system
of probation was instituted and finally in
modern days Juvenile Courts were insti-
tuted.
The data given by a recent English Par-
liamentary Committee show the immense
change that has taken place in 80 years.
In 1925. 27,801 children’s cases were dealt
with, of which all but 50 were adjudicated
upon summarily, 45 of the remainder being
withdrawn or dismissed. In only 15 cases
were offenders committed for trial. Of the
cases dealt with 3465 were withdrawn or
dismissed and in 15,633 —more than half
the total—the charge was held to have
been proved and orders were made without
the conviction being recorded, the object
being not to sully the child’s character in
after life. Of the 8653 persons convicted
by the Juvenile Courts in 1925, only five
were sent to prison. Contrast this, bearing
in mind the enormous increase in popula-
tion, with the 10,703 young folk under 17
imprisoned or transported in 1849. In 1925,
Reformatory Schools received 574 young
offenders; 452 were given a beating with a
birch rod in the presence, if so desired, of
their parents. In 7578 cases, fines were in-
flicted which in most cases, no doubt, were
indirect penalties on parents for neglect.
Of the total number of charges, about a
third were classified as simple larceny, a
sixth as malicious damage and the remainder
were made up of breaches of police and civic
regulations, petty gambling and other minor
offences.
During the last 30 years the number of
minors executed in England and Wales
totalled 22,- and since 1887 no condemned
youth under the age of 18 has been executed.

A Tas. Premier’s Opportunity.
Tas. Treasurer Lyons, in pursuance of his
pet task of heartening a somewhat despon-
dent Speck, declares that the latest arrange-
ment with the Commonwealth will improve
Tasmania’s position by nearly £70,000 a
year. Certainly every little helps, but with
the railways losing a steady £200,000, the
roads demanding at least £lOO,OOO to save
their lives, and the population at a stand-
still or worse, the estimated betterment
doesn’t look likely to promote dreams of
opulence among the taxpayers. Still, it is
beginning to be recognised that a Premier
who so persistently boosts optimism and
boots pessimism is himself a pretty good
asset. Thus everybody is inclined to en-
courage Lyons to keep on declaring his
belief that Tasmania is “turning the corner,”
in the more or less certain hope that some
sort of psychological impetus will be added
to desire and complete the operation.
So marked is this inclination in Tasmania
at present that it looks like Lyons’s supreme
opportunity of showing the world whether
he is a statesman or a mere politician. It
is believed that any practical reform which
he cared to put forward as an essential aid
to the process of “turning the corner” would
be cheerfully accepted by a majority of the
people of the State, regardless of political
party or sectional traditions and interests.
If this belief is correct, there is no pro-
posal so heroic, no reform so drastic, that
Lyons might not submit it for the con-
sideration of his fellow-citizens with every
chance of success.
The continued and excessive loss of popu-
lation through lack of employment is Tas-
mania’s most pressing trouble. It is the
fundamental problem, the solution of which
is the acid test of a Government. If
Premier Lyons possesses the courage and
the farsightedness of real statesmanship,
surely now is his time. It is recognised by
the thinking people of all parties in all the
States that the smallest State, if she would
retain her Statehood, will be economically
compelled to lead the way in the adoption
of those bedrock reorganisations which
eventually will become incumbent upon all
the States in turn if the Commonwealth is
to prosper. If the States would be saved,
they must save themselves. If the Com-
monwealth does the rescuing—well, that is
the end of the States, as States. True,
unification is not inconceivable, as a short
cut. But no scheme of unification yet adum-
brated suggests the total abolition of local
self-government. And, of course, that means
the control by the local governing bodies
of the chief asset of the States —the main
producing element, the land, its tenures
and titles and organised uses.
It seems therefore reasonable to sup-
pose that if the exodus of population has
direct connection with the good or bad or
indifferent utilisation of the lands of Tas-
mania, land reform will engage the Tas.
Premier’s attention. And, if legislative
institutions, by their inefficiency, oppressive-
ness, expensiveness, offensiveness or unre-
presentativeness, are responsible for the
exodus, or any considerable part of it, then
legislative reform must be tackled, too.
There is no lack of material for statesman-
like action.

White Men in Cages.
Some of the well-intentioned but ill-
informed people of the Trades Hall
tried the other day to create com-
plications over the arrival at Townsville
of an alleged slave-ship, appropriately
named the Hai Hum, with a cargo of 480
Asiatics stated to be in cages and bound
for the French plantations in the New
Hebrides. The Hai Hum was till lately
in the China trade. That is to say, she
went about her peaceful job in seas where
the ancient profession of piracy has been
revived owing to the feebleness or indiffer-
ence or connivance of the multitudinous
Chinese Governments. The usual procedure
of the pirates is to come aboard disguised
as deck passengers and when the opportune
moment arrives, usually when the vessel is
off Cheleng Point, midway between Hong
Kong and Swatow, to rush the ship, first
of ail overpowering the few white officers,
then looting everybody and compelling the
master to navigate their capture into Bias
Bay, their headquarters, some 40 miles
n.-e. of Hong Kong. Three of the King’s
last birthday honors were 0.8.E.’s pre-
sented to the chief and second officers and
chief engineer of the China Steam Naviga-
tion Co.’s ship Sunning for conspicuous
gallantry in rescuing the vessel from such
a gang.
On account of these pirates it has been
found necessary to amend the Chinese
Passenger-ship Ordinance and compel all
vessels, irrespective of nationality, to have
the bridge, engine-room officers’ and en-
gineers’ cabins protected by grills or grids
of iron bars strongly set up and interlaced.
The bridge must be furnished with collap-
sible iron screens fitted with loopholes for
rifles, and another rule provides for an
armed guard and for lethal weapons to be
distributed amongst the officers. These are
regulations imposed by the Chinese, not
a foreign, Government.
So in reality it is the white executive
staff of the Hai Hum which is encaged—
and very glad to be so, in the circumstances.
As for the alleged enslaving of the 480
Asiatics, they p'robably never saw so much
money in their lives as they are now draw-
ing per month. Most of the “slaves” who
are carted about the Pacific—34o,ooo of
them entered Singapore last year alone and
there would have been half a million if
the tuchun in their home province hadn’t
clapped a 25-dollar export-tax on the raw
material to pay for a war—are recruited
by their own compatriots from centres of
hideous over-population; and when they
leave their foetid walled cities they thrive
so well that they unanimously soon start
remitting money to their surprised families.
The gentry who overrun Singapore and
Penang with their garish mansions and who
own the most luxurious motor-cars, tin
mines, sugar fabriks and rubber plantations
and the best building sites for their family
graveyards are either “slaves” or descen-
dants of former “slaves.”

A Rural Basic Wage.
When “good old Piddo” set out to fix a
rural basic wage for N.S.W., Dr. Evatt
opened the ball for the A.W.U. with a well-
meant suggestion:—
It would be a good thing if the Com-
mission fixed a rural wage higher than that
applying to other workers. Rural workers
would be encouraged to remain in the rural
industries, so that these industries and the
whole country would progress.
The doctor’s heart is in the right place,
anyhow. But there are big carnivora in
the way. The official report (June, 1925)
said there were 139,480 rural toilers, as
distinguished from the pastoral crowd, per-
manently employed in N.S.W. Of these,
70,208 were owners, lessees or share farmers,
who get much or little or nothing as it hap-
pens; 37,962 were paid on an average £175
per annum, including the value of board and
lodging supplied, which isn’t even the town
basic wage; and 31,309, all aged above 14.
received only board, lodging and, it is to
be hoped, clothes. The young children who
toil are not counted, and the number of
casual employees couldn’t be given, but
their aggregate pay was set down at rather
less than half that of the permanents. So
all that has to be done is to (1) raise the
wages of the continuous workers, (2) give
a corresponding increase to the casuals and
(3) shift the great mass of honorary toilers
on to the pay-sheet, for if that is not done
the basic wage will be a sham; and (41
do all this in an industry which can’t
pass the extra cost on to its foreign cus-
tomers, though it might increase the food
bills of the local ones. But the age of
miracles is past, and Moseses can no longer
bring forth streams of wealth by waving a
stick and ordering high wages and low
prices to transpire—not even bright young
legal city Moseses with a shower of uni-
versity degrees.

Seeing the Light.
Thebe is a ray of hope for British industry
in the cabled news that the Miners’ Federa-
tion has lost nearly half its membership of
800,000 to the Industrial Miners’ Union.
The latter was founded by G. A. Spencer,
the Labor M.P. who headed the break-
away of the Notts and Derby miners which
finally led to the collapse of the hopeless
and disastrous British coal strike.
The new union differs from the older
one only in that it cuts adrift from political
movements, thus following the example
of the American Federation of Labor. Its
almost immediate success indicates that a
great proportion of British miners are sick
of the tyranny of the union bosses acting
as heelers for the revolutionary Left Wing,
which, in its turn, is a cherished and perhaps
subsidised protege of the Soviet. The
British Trades and Labor Council refuses
to recognise the new body, but its increas-
ing popularity with the workers themselves
suggests that this attitude cannot be kept
up. The subscription of £lO,OOO to the
new Union by the National Seamen’s Union
is especially significant, foV the latter has
long abandoned affiliation with the politicals,
under the leadership of Havelock Wilson,
and has found existence all the better with-
out the strike and political levies which
have grown to be the curse of modern
industrial organisation, and which fall
nowhere more heavily than in Australia.
There are many thousands of unionists
in Australia who would be glad to make
the same experiment if given a definite
lead.

“Malakuna”: Secondary education has gone
a little mad in Victoria. For two years
the writer attempted to impart a knowledge
of French to the youth of Collingwood,
who had no option but to suffer the imposi-
tion; of course, after a few weeks of “adap-
tation to environment” I gave up any
serious attempt to do the job. The Inspec-
tor, a lovable and indulgent old son of
France, visited us periodically, and agreed
that I was doing the only sensible thing in
letting French syntax alone and spending
the daily half hour attempting, in English,
to give some first-hand impressions of his
country and a sympathetic understanding
of its peoples—human geography, in fact,
but not in French. I was not, of course,
in any way teaching the prescribed syllabus,
but the lads and I were having a glorious
time together—learning French! There
were disquieting moments, however, when
a pretence of teaching the elements of
French syntax was necessary; such as the
occasion of the periodical visit of half a
dozen learned dignitaries of the Secondary
Branch of the Education Department—the
Board of Secondary Inspectors, no less,
come solemnly en masse to view and report
glowingly on the progress of Secondary
Education in Collingwood—especially the
teaching of French! This is the day of
the specialist, the one-subject teacher, but
one wonders sometimes if specialising is
not a little blind. What is required for the
boys of Collingwood and such areas to-day
is not specialists in learning, but specialists
in boys, and in boys of the type found there.
Reform on these lines is urgently needed.

Another meeting was held the other day
to consider ways and means of creating
a permanent orchestra for Melbourne. No
progress was made. The trouble seems to
be that the people who might take the most
active interest in the project are concerned
in music-making from a material standpoint.
There are three bodies at present engaged
in Melbourne in a precarious struggle to
stem the tide of negro melody; they all
want a cut from any public funds available,
and they, or a considerable part of them,
are obviously afraid that a permanent
orchestra will threaten the jobs of their
own players. In the present starved state
of the music market, they are probably
right. What is badly wanted is more public
interest in the project and more confidence
in Australian musical ability.

“Feng-Shui”: To Mr. P. D. Phillips (B.
14/7/’27), may I say that I did not confuse
the Institute of Pacific Relations with the
Pan-Pacific Science Congress? The latter
deals with concrete things, whereas the
former traffics mainly in abstractions.
Brown, tawny and white professors can all
agree on the advisability of abolishing the
anopheles mosquito. What basis for dis-
cussion is there for a collection of China-
men, Japanese, Koreans, Australians and
Americans when such matters of sentiment
as Asiatic nationalism, colored immigration
and Western Imperialism appear on the
agenda paper? Mr. Phillips assures us
that a majority of the Institute are quite
sound on the White Australia policy. Most
of the educated Asiatics of my acquaintance
are quite sound on the subject of world
equality for the colored peoples, so it looks
as if the Institute had agreed to drop a
burning question for the sake of a specious
unanimity.


INVESTMENT.
When an Investor consults his Solicitor or other adviser, it is not to
learn the interest or dividend rate a given investment will earn—that is
usually known.
Security is an important factor—another is the period of investment.
Gi.en ample security for a suit-ble term, the wise investor is satisfied with a
reasonable interest rate.
A Savings Account offers these advantages, and, in addition, tne
principal may be added to at ar.y time, in amounts of from 1/- upwards, with
a corresponding increase in interest-earning; the money remains practically
at call, for it may be withdrawn at will.
Investment in a Savings Account may be made at any Post Office in
Australia, or at any Brancn of the
Commonwealth lank of Bnstralia
(Guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government.)

POLITICAL
POINTS
One of Queensland’s oldest State enter-
prises, the fish depot on Moreton Bay, has
been turned over to the Exploiters. It will
probably prove as profitable to the new
owners as the N.S.W. trawling industry
has done since the State abandoned the mis-
conduct thereof. Governments have their
uses, but they are dead failures at selling
fish.
McTiernan, who was Bang’s Attorney-
General and white-haired boy until just
before the split, when he turned fiercely upon
his former little tin god, has decided not to
be a candidate at the general election. In
explaining why, McTiernan skipped all round
the real reason; he doesn’t believe his oppo-
nents capable of giving him a fair run in a
preliminary ballot —or afterwards if by acci-
dent lie should w 7 in there. Evatt, the party’s
other young lawyer, has been considering his
position, too; but in Balmain he is in a
much stronger position to defy Lang than
McTiernan is in any part of his old con-
stituency.
Vic.’s deficit of £682,000 is not quite so
bad as it looks. For instance, £148,620 re-
presented old debts in suspense accounts,
and £105,215 for bank guarantees on country
freezing works was also included, while there
was £62,000 for increases of pay for teachers
which could not be computed in time for the
ordinary estimates as appeals had not been
dealt with, ilogan won’t show his Budget
hand at present, but a big increase in income-
tax is bound to be his trump card. And if
Premier Hogan agrees with Opposition-leader
Hogan he will reduce the over-staffed railway
department or, at any rate, he won’t fill
vacancies.
When N.S.W. Premier Lang invents a tale
for the damage of his political opponents he
sticks to it wonderfully. Glue isn’t in the
same continent with him for adhesiveness.
One of the dozen yarns of the moment is
that Bavin and Bnttensliaw have declared
for “the elimination of State and Federal
awards.” The words used were “the elimi-
nation of the overlapping of State and Fed-
eral awards,” but sawing out three words
makes a difference. A similar effect could be
produced when Lung says: “I am of opinion
that the Nationalists are a curse to the
country.” Leave out six words and the
Auburn estate agent truly remarks: lam
a curse to the country.” Remarkable effects
can be produced that way.
South Australia had a deficit at June 30
like Queensland and Victoria, which makes
seven shortages in 12 years. It was a fane
big shortage, too —£1,0(55,246. The State s
revenue and ordinary expenditure and loan
expenditure and public debt and interest bill
have all doubled or more than doubled in
the dozen years—in fact, the interest lias
about trebled. It is proposed to ask the
Commonwealth Government for a subsidy
similar to those which Westralia and Tas-
mania receive, “as compensation for dis-
abilities arising out of Federation,” though
Federation didn’t make the wonderful debt.
When the amiable Bruce-Page has com-
mitted the Commonwealth to subsidising all
the States, in addition to helping with their
sinking funds and their roads, it will require
a very slight cracking of the customs boom
to make it in need of help itself.
The problem of the moment at Sydney
Town Haul is: Why do Labor aldermen want
lo pay £7125 for certain bricks when they
can be got for £6033? This is quite apart
from the problem of why Labor aldermen
are desirous of parting with £65,000 or so
for a coal lease on which the city will still
have to pay a heavy rental, thus making
the £65,000 or so seem rather superfluous.
TO WHAT BASE USES.
“‘Mr. Lang has granted’.... ‘Mr. Bavin has promised’.... ‘Mr. Bruce has undertaken’... ‘Mr.
Hogan has consented’.... etc., etc.”
ANGELINA: “Why so angry, Egbert?”
EGBERT: “Angry? You can’t sit on a twig nowadays without getting all mucked up
with the birdlime that some wretched politician has dabbed on to catch votes!
Assistant Minister Marr, who fusses
around the Home and Territories Depart-
ment, has evolved a °reat scheme for assist-
ing oil research in Papua and New Guinea
by aerial survey (photography, in effect),
requisitioning the R.A.A.F. Aeroplanes may
come in all right for carting geologists about;
but most of Papua and New Guinea is cov-
ered with dense forest. To photograph this
with a view to discovering oil-bearing for-
mations would be as sensible as noting the
contours of the Medici Venus by snapshotting
her in a fur coat.
One of the N.S.W. Lang Government’s
good deeds which shine in a naughty world
was to take wildflowers under its protec-
tion ; and it seems to be making an honest
attempt to enforce the law. In Queensland,
on the other hand, the Government has de-
clared a month’s open season for native
bears. The native bear is a lovable and
harmless little beast, and there are not many
of him left; but his jacket is valuable, and
even a month’s work with the rifle and
cyanide will put money in the pockets of
many out-of-works in the country. These
have been getting restive, and talking about
taking it out of someone. Temporary-Pre-
mier Forgan Smith evidently considers it
will be better if they take it out of the
bear's hide, rather than his.
Amendments of Maoriland’s Industrial Arbi-
tration Act —pioneer of all such measures —wil 1
be introduced this session. The Court wall
probably be empowered to extend the piece-
work system to many industries, and the
‘‘basic wage” will disappear, payment being
based on an industry’s capacity to pay.
Hitherto the Court has laid it down as a
cardinal principle that it is not interested
in profits or losses, but strives to fix a fair
reward for labor. Abolition of preference
to unionists won’t be a feature of the Govern-
ment’s proposals, but there will be a strong
drive on the part of country members to
graft the principle on to the hill. And a
lot more scope will be given to conciliatory
conferences.
According to the official estimate, Australia
added 122,593 to its population between
March, 192 G. and March, 1927. This was
excess of births 71,830, and excess of arrivals
47,757. It would be better if the arrivals
were more strictly British than they are;
still Australia seems a tine place for attract-
ing population, and it would attract a vast
number more if the loony device of perpetual
foreign loans was knocked fatally on the head
and importations were, as the inevitable re-
sult, cut down with a big axe, and ‘the com-
munity had thus a great deal more work to
do making its own clothes and things—
unless it preferred to go partially naked.
The nominations for the N.S.W. Labor
selection ballots give the Lang-Seale-Garden
faction a decided advantage at the so-called
Unity Conference. Ten of the present
Assemblymen are without opponents; eight
are for Lang and two for Mutch. Then
McTiernan and Greig, of the Mutch faction,
haven’t nominated, and the others, for the
most part, have many antagonists—Cann has
ten in Lakemba, Goodin seven in Albury,
Lazzarini five in Marrickville and McKell
five in Rcdfern —whereas the opposi-
tion to a number of the Lang men is
weak. The question now is whether the
Federal executive will be strong enough to
stand by its own rules and resolutions or
weak enough to let them go and shout with
the larger mob.
Terrible things are happening in China.
It was cabled the other day that the Nation-
alist Government, being up against the Great
Wall of finance, “floated a loan by the simple
process of telling each citizen of means how
much he was expected to contribute and then
confiscating his property to that amount.”
In N. S. Wales we do things quite differently.
Lang doesn’t “confiscate” anybody’s property.
He gets a Taxation Department to tell the
citizen of means how much he is expected
to contribute (and not by way of a loan
either), and then levies on his goods and
chattels and sells them if he fails to pay up.
Victoria’s new Government shows a real
desire to do things, unlike its petrified pre-
decessor. It proposes to immortalise itself
by developing the Outer Ports and by read-
justing the Assembly representation and put-
ting it on something like a population basis.
It is to be hoped that some happenings at
the Outer Ports will lead to a readjustment
of population, for Victoria has degenerated
into a suburb of Melbourne. In 1921, out
of every thousand Victorian inhabitants 511
lived in the metropolis. In 1925 it is esti-
mated that 542 per thousand were domiciled
there. Possibly the best idea would be the
removal of the seat of government to a minor
town a long distance away so as to create a
new centre of population, thus following the
example of Canberra, Delhi and Angora.
Another device would be the establishment of
Melbourne as a separate City State. This
would leave the land-settlement problem in
the hands of men who generally know a cow
when they see it.
“Bildad”: The futile and furious row in
North Queensland shows up a glaring defect
of the Federal Constitution. There should
be 1000 men on the spot, either Federal
troops or militia of some sort, not with a
view to shooting anybody, but to prevent the
parties shooting and assaulting. each other
and passers-by. Some unauthorised persons
are, or have been, doing a spasmodic kind of
constabulary work and have kept patches of
order in a disorderly way, but that isn’t gov-
ernment. The Commonwealth is not autho-
rised to interfere whatever happens, except
bv request and permission of the State Min-
istry. No State may maintain a militia of its
own except by permission of the Common-
wealth. So when a colorable imitation of
rebellion breaks forth in a congenial spot it
is sometimes left to burn itself out and some-
times it is extinguished by amateurs. The
outstanding point is that the Australian Gov-
ernment has no right of its men to protect
its Australian people outside the N. Territory
and the Canberra area even if Communists
seize the whole six States at once and set the
six capitals on fire.
The presence of only four Ministers on
the front Opposition bench when Vic. Par-
liament assembled recalled W. H. Irvine’s
resignation as Opposition leader 20 years
ago because of the aloofness of former Min-
isters. The Assembly had gone to its tem-
porary home at the Exhibition and Irvine
had succeeded Allan McLean as leader of
the Left. Seats were being pegged out. but
no names were attached to the front bench.
One Oppositionist, pointing to the unlabelled
bench and referring to Irvine’s captaincy,
penned a parody on Tom Moore: “When
true hearts are withered and fond ones arc
flown, oh, who would inhabit this bleak
bench alone?” Irvine was so nettled that
he wrote out his resignation and sent it to
E. H. Cameron, then Whip. The party
rallied and, promising loyal support, per-
suaded the gentleman to withdraw his letter.
A year later he was Premier.
South Africa’s latest labor trouble is one
familiar enough in Australia, though on a
different plane. The Labor section of the
Government has raised the wages of its
P.W.D. and Railway native laborers to Bs. a
day on the plea that Umslopogaas can’t “live
respectably” on less. As a result, all the
Kaffirs and Hindus employed in the Union
are clamoring for Bs. a day, and forming
unions to get it. The average wage for
native labor is about 2s. a day. so the in-
crease will hit producers of all kinds to leg
for six if it becomes general.
Lang’s impost on N.S.W. newspapers will
be remembered as the boomerang tax. When
the Court ruled it out the money had to
be returned to the newspapers, and it being
impossible for them to locate each separate
subscriber of id., they mostly gave it to hos-
pitals. Then the hospital people called round
on Lang for the usual £ for £ subsidy.
Balonne (Q.) is to have a by-election next
month, so Attorney-ueneral Johnny Mullan
has called attention to the elastic provisions
of the Elections Act, as amended in 1925.
Anyone who “believes” he or she will be out
of the electorate (44,800 sq. miles) on pol-
ling-day, August 6, may vote at any time
between the issue of the writ and 6 p.m. on
August 5. What will happen if such a voter
finds that his or her “belief” was unfounded
and merrily votes again on election-day is not
included in Mullan’s explanation.
UNMUZZLED.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
“None of the Vie. party leaders made increase of
payment of members even a minor issue at the
elections. The subject was carefully eschewed until
the new House met, when two members, one Min-
isterial and the other Oppositionist, were applauded
from all sides of the House for pointing out that .CIO
a week was shockingly inadequate remuneration for
Parliamentary services.”
When you’re satisfied your income doesn't
tally
With your exes, as a Parliamentary gent.,
When you’re in the frame of mind of King
O’Malley,
Who querulously threatened that lie meant
In the Gardens thrice a day to boil his bally
Billy and by nights to doss there in a
tent,
Just remember that a fellow is expected
To eschew the theme till after he’s elected.
Never make a song about the situation
While you’re supplicating votes, or go off
pop; ...
For your audience, consumed with indigna-
tion,
Might then, and there incontinently drop
Thoughts of dooming you to any such priva-
tion
As is incidental to the Talking Shop.
It might even be inferred your brains were
mossy
To deliberately covet such a possy.
Jaundiced hecklers might suggest that you
were fretting
Over some absurd supposititious ill;
Chaps might question the propriety of letting
You dip your fingers further in the till
With no preliminary attempt at getting
Some evidence that it’s the people’s will.
Innuendos such as these and jabs and
thru stings
Are infernally unpleasant on the hustings.
So, howe’er you boil remember to keep quiet
Till you’ve settled in your seat and signed
the roll.
Then you can let your caustic tongue run
riot
And liberate your torn and bleeding soul—
And help, mayhap, to pass another fiat
Augmenting such a miserable dole.
Though the country brand it crooked work
and rotten
’Tis a monty in three years ’twill be for-
gotten.

“Sierra” : A few days ago the crew of a
N. S. Wales trawler operating off Montague
Island netted an outsize in sea-lions. On
being dumped on deck the beast immediately
tore his way through the net and, baring his
teeth like a bucko mate, scattered his cap-
tors in all directions. For over an hour lie
remained in charge, the crew watching his
antics from various places of safety until it
pleased the intruder to slither over the bul-
warks into the sea. It is said to be a super-
stition among fishermen that the killing of
a sea-lion is likely to fasten a worse hoodoo
on a ship than tin; slaughter of an albatross,
which seems to have been a handy sort of
superstition in the present case.

“C.Q.”: The Metropolitan Board of Works
in Melbourne recently decided to devote a
large sum to beautifying the Yarra, which
in the course of centuries has become almost
completely filled with enormous logs. To
drag the logs out the beautifiers have had to
cut down swathes of living trees, and that
portion of the river which has so far been
attended to looks about as sightly as a
plucked hen. Strange to say, although the
rights of proputty are as sacred in Vic. as
elsewhere, the board met no opposition until
it reached Heidelberg. There two dairymen
owning the land on opposite shores flatly
refused to allow the gangs to enter, one
because he is a nature-lover and the other
because the carts cut the fields to pieces. The
board argued that the work will save the
farmers from floods, but the farmers like a
flood every few years tor the same reason as
the Gyppo does. The board is alleged to
have shadowy rights over 30 feet of fore-
shore, and the two Hampdens say it is at
liberty to use ueroplanes to reach that terri-
tory.

“X.N.0.”: “M.G.S.” (B. 30/6/’27) says
that the Admiral at Hong Kong during the
Boxer business made the signal “Well done!”
to South Australia’s Protector. No such
colloquial expression could possibly find its
way into a naval signal book; the nearest
approach to it is (or was) “FP” —meaning
“Manoeuvre well executed.” This is the
signal which was made to the Condor at
the bombardment of Alexandria, although it
has gone down into history as “Well done,
Condor.”

“C.V.R.”: Vic. Railway Commissioner
Clapp’s new regulation permitting the escort
of a female passenger to have access to the
platform free of charge recalls a Sydney
dispute over a
somewhat similar
claim that was
carried right up to
the Privy Council,
although the sum
originally involved
was only a penny.
Robertson, a Syd-
ney barrister, was
escorting his
fiancee to the Bal-
main ferry and,
after paying her
fare, attempted to
pass through the
barrier without
paying his own, ex-
plaining that he
had no intention of
travelling on the
ferry. After some
argument he was
forcibly prevented
from entering and
the result was that
he issued a writ
against the Bal-
main Ferries for
damages for as-
sault. At the first
trial, before the
late Justice Win-
deyer, the plaintiff
got a verdict; but,
recognising that
the matter was one
of vital interest to
all ferry companies,
the Sydney Ferries
undertook to share
the costs of an
appeal to the Privy
Council. That
august body upset
Windeyer’s decision
and incidentally
gave to ferry com-
panies the right,
exercised ever since,
to exclude any per-
son from their
wharves unless, the fare is first paid.
“Flagwagger”: One wandering Australian
lias a novel way of sending news of his wel-
fare and indications of his whereabouts to his
parents in Melbourne. Born and reared in a
sparsely-populated district of N.S.W., far
from any school, he never learned to read
and write. Now, as he drifts about the con-
tinent from one l;~.sh job to another, he gets
the storekeeper to parcel and address some
article for him, and then dispatches it to
his parents, paying the railway and, if neces-
sary, the coach freights. His last “letter”
was a tin of biscuits from Broken Hill.
Among many other practical communica-
tions the old folk number a pair of
blankets, a dozen yards of flannel, boots and
shoes, and once, from Bungaree (Vic.), a
bag of spuds. Incidentally, the nomad served

with the A.1.F., and his parents still treasure
a fine collection of silks, postcards, brooches,
etc., with which their soldier son kept in
touch with them during his three years
overseas.
* * *
“The Rumpus”: It is an antiquated and
laborious method of demolishing a chimney-
stack for steeplejacks to dismantle it from
the top, brick by brick (B. 23/6/’27). Gen-
erally there is one clear line of space to safely
fall the chimney, and bricks are chiselled out
at the base with that direction in view. As
each brick is removed the space is filled with
a block of wood of similar size, bored through
in half a dozen places and soaked with kero-
sene or petrol. When a sufficient number of
bricks have been shifted and replaced these
supports are ignited. I can recall only one
instance of a stack veering, the result of the
wooden blocks not burning evenly.
* # * *
“Bouragi”: Let me assure “C.C.” (B.
14/7/’27) that my personal and official con-
tact with missionaries was a happy one. It
embraced such men as the late Bishop Stone-
Wigg and Copeland King, also Bishop New-
ton, at present incumbent of the see of
Papua. On the other hand I cannot forget
a missionary of another denomination who
hounded a high Papuan official to an un-
timely grave by a persistent campaign of
slander and vituperation, in the press and
elsewhere, regarding a matter of which he
knew no tliing 'except by hearsay, and. who
later declined to attend a Royal Commission
in Australia, at Federal expense, to try to
make good his charges. It is the missionary
of that type who does so much to bring the
profession into contempt, and detracts from
the medico-industrial side of mission work
for which so much good can be said.
* * * *
“Spare Sub”: What make of automatic
pistol lias “Bad Australian” in mind (B.
14/7/’27) when he says that given similar
calibre and length of barrel there is nothing
to choose in the matter of accuracy and
penetration between the auto and the re-
volver? If lie will try the two on a 3in.-thick
pine board at 100yds., firing from a vice to
eliminate the human factor, I fancy he will
change his mind. A good make of auto —I
put the German Mauser first of the three
makes I have used—has a trajectory as flat
as any high-power rifle up to 300 yards, and
a muzzle velocity almost as high. The trajec-
tory of the best revolver made —the long-
barrel service Webley—would, at that dis-
tance, describe a curve like a flapper’s eye-
brow. There is no comparison in hitting
power, for while the auto loses no more gas
than a machine-gun, the greater proportion
of the explosive mixture from a revolver goes
to waste between the fore-end of the tumbler
and the barrel, with an appreciable “back-
spit” from round the fired cartridge case.
Anyone who has had to use his revolver
quickly hnd continuously will testify to the
scorched and blackened pistol hand which
ensued. Further, a “bulged” cartridge case
will jam a revolver tumbler as often as it
will the auto’s “feed,” and even with the
“break open” type takes as long to put right.
* $ *
“Nikko”: The statement that the Navy
could unaided have forced the Narrows (B.
7/7/’27) will provoke some hot dissent.
When lecturing in. Auckland some years ago
Ashmead Bartlett related that he had in-
formed Admiral de liobeck that the extensive
bombardment of the British Navy had demol-
ished two Turkish guns. “I’m glad to learn
that,” remarked the old sea-dog, grimly;
“my information said only one!”
* * * *
“4X2”: I believe the army revolver to be
more accurate than any automatic (B.
7/7/’27) ; but obviously the Germans didn’t
think so. Many ex-soldiers will recall a be-
lief widely prevalent in France that an
officer captured by Fritz with arms other
than the regulation revolver in his possession
had a poor chance of escaping with his life.
I carried a small automatic in addition to
the Webley until older hands induced me to
dispense with it, pointing out that several
officers had been found dead in the trench
after a raid, with their automatic ammunition
pushed into their tunic buttonholes. We took
this as a hint from Jerry that the carrying of
automatics by British officers was acutely
resented. The same belief was held about
the sawn-off shot-gun loaded with buckshot
which was so popular with Uncle Sam’s
forces w’hen they first arrived in the line.
The enemy didn’t believe in these new-
fangled contraptions, at any rate in the hands
of the opposition.

(Captured on July 25, 1916.)
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On the road to Poziferes in the sunny days,
Blackberry hedges rambling wide by the
winding ways,
Gay and gallant company—Mac, old man,
you know
How we went to Poziferes, years and years
ago.
Down from Sailly-sur-la-Lys (“Au revoir,
Mamzell”),
Round by sleepy Mont-des-Cats ("What
about a spell?”) ;
Mac, you must remember still, as you dream-
ing lie,
Happy days to Poziferes ’neath a summer
sky?
Droning of the battleplanes o’er a shattered
wood,
Scrambling through the broken walls where
a village stood—
Mac, old man, do you recall, did you ever
know,
How we came to Pozi&res years and years
ago?
Short the road to Pozffires ’neath the summer
sun,
Glad the road to Pozteres where your goal
was won.
Careless jest and swift response—Mac, do
you forget?
But the road from Pozihres we are tramping
yet.
LOOKING WELL AHEAD.
“Let’s get married, old thing—and we’ll live at the rate of a
thousand a year.”
“Indeed! For how long?”
“Oh, well, I haven’t worked it out an’ all that, but until
Monday, anyhow.”
Short the road to Pozieres with that gallant
throng,
But the road from Poziferes, oh! ’tis hard
and long.
Sick we grow of little men with their paltry
schemes ;
Yours the happier road, Mac, for you kept
your dreams.

“Peter Paul”; “MG.S.” in his remarks
on the bronze war memorial at Geelong
Grammar School (B. 7/7/’27) really pays
the artist a high compliment when he refers
a little disparagingly to “the static element
in Lambert’s muse.” The design is executed
in what is known among sculptors as “still
technique”; what amounts almost to an
effect of suspended animation was exactly
the one sought after. This sort of stillness con-
trasts sharply with the lifelessness so appar-
ent in most of the statuary of Sydney, and
it is this quality which lifts the Lambert
memorial above the ordinary level. Finally,
the figure of youth is in no sense intended
to be that of a fighter. It is perfect youth,
triumphant on account of its youth rather
than its muscular development.
* * * :]:
“Mako”: It isn’t always the person at the
exchange end of the telephone who hears
abusive words (B. 14/7/’27). At Auckland
one morning the manager of a big insurance
company found himself being smartly rated
by a bad-tempered telephone girl. Turning
out of his office still smarting under the im-
pertinence he ran into Joseph Ward, then
head of the P. and T. Department. “Come
in here, Joe,” urged the insurance man; “I
want you to use my ’phone for a moment.”
Joe complied, the same young woman had the
misfortune to answer, and as she was still
suffering from temper Ward got a bit of the
rough side of her tongue. After bewilderingly
mopping his brow for a moment the Minister
rose and streaked for the switch-room. The
damsel’s telephonic career closed 10 minutes
later.
* * * *
“Miro”: When the man with the telescope
arrived at the Maori settlement in the Ure-
wera district recently his instrument was a
source of great interest to Henare and Co.
Amazing stories of the telescope’s magical
properties reached the isolated whare of Hone
Kaihu and he decided to make a trip across
the valley to satisfy himself that these mar-
vels were true, but he turned a deaf ear to
the suggestion from Toroti, his wahine, that
she should go, too. Hone arrived to investi-
gate the telescope on his way to catch the
coach for town, where he had some business
to do with Timi Pirra. He was placed in
position and the instrument focussed on
various objects of note, finally taking in
Hone’s whare, three miles away. Hone bent
a careful scrutiny on the place, then removed
himself abruptly. “What’s the matter,
Hone?” asked the demonstrator. “You terra
Timi I no ko to town to-day,” flung Hone
over his shoulder. “You terra him Toroti no
tig to potato rilie I terra her. You terra him
she sit town and smoke te pipe and I ko
home and kick her and come back to-mor-
row.’”

“Ming”: It was an up-country political
meeting and after the three Country party
candidates had unfolded their views and
answered various more or less relevant ques-
tions, several local speakers mounted the plat-
form and gave their opinion of the political
situation, being urged thereto by the Mayor,
who deprecated the apathy apparent in the
community. Suddenly an ex-jockey approached
the platform with the air of having something
important to impart. Glad to encourage such
speakers the chairman graciously beckoned
him forward; the candidates folded their arms
with the air of men ready to learn the dis-
trict’s requirements from any source and the
audience waited expectantly. Advancing to
the edge of the platform the newcomer fixed a
cold and searching eye on the gathering. “Me
ten-guinea brindled bull-pup has been stole,”
he said, “an’ wot I wanter find out is do any
qf yous know anytliink about ’im?”

“Coot”: The Postal Department is evi-
dently searching for the youngest Digger.
In a recent Commonwealth Gazette it
advertises for a draftsman, who must be
under 25 years old. “Preference,” it is
added, “will be given to returned sailors
and soldiers with the necessary qualifica-
tions.” To be entitled to such preference
it is obvious that an applicant must have
been no more than 16 when the war ended.
* * * *
“X.S.”: A woman proceeded against her
husband for maintenance the other day in
Melbourne. The lady, an ex-Bendigonian
barmaid, admitted that her conduct was the
cause of the separation and that she was
a generally uncomfortable person to live
with. According to her spouse, she emptied
a tin of kerosene on him on one occasion
and then pursued him with a twist of lighted
paper, with the object of seeing how he
would burn, like Nero with the Christians.
The Judge ordered the husband to find a
surety of £25. and pay 355. weekly to the
lady. Apparently he thought the fellow ought
to do something by way of thanksgiving.
* * * *
“Exdig”: A bunch of men of the A.I.F.
Ist Battalion who kicked over the traces
during the start of the German push in 1918
have had tardy justice done them by the
restoration of their gratuity rights. The
battalion were hurried down from near
Ypres to Amiens, and then rushed back
again to fill the gap in the north where
Fritz was making his last desperate effort
to break through. They helped to check
him and after that life became for them a
sequence of line service, temporary relief in
reserves for reorganisation (with a promise
that the next time out would be a real holi-
day) and return to the line. The batt. was
part of the spearhead in the big thrust when
the Allies’ turn to be aggressive came. Here
they did some great work, and when one
position they had taken was lost by reliev-
ing troops they recaptured it, only to be
told next day they would be further wanted
and the expected spell would have to be
again postponed. This was the last straw;
150 men simply walked out of the line. It
was flat mutiny, of course, but the men
were almost without officers, and the n.c.o.’s,
some of whom had fought since the Land-
ing, finding themselves unable to hold the
men, went with the stream. It was these
n.c.o.’s who were hit hardest when penal-
ties were handed out —a pathetic ending for
years of service, although the sentences were
remitted after the Armistice. Considering
all the circumstances, the gratuity rights
might have been given back long ago.

“The Mcllaggis”: All the martyrs for
conscience sake did not perish with the
Scottish Covenanters. The House of Com-
THE LAGGARDS.
“Interminable negotiations proceed at the conference at Geneva for the reduction of armaments.”
“Madame, you must have patience.”
“Patience! Must I sacrifice my grandchild as well as my sons?”
mons has been asked to consider the hard
case of Norman Shaw, an Argyllshire Scot
wjio, after 10 years in the lighthouse service,
was asked to take wireless instruction on
the Sawbath. The worthy soul flatly re-
fused and further informed his superiors
that anyone utilising the Lord’s Day for
such a purpose would have ample time for
repentance in Hell; but they, possibly be-
cause Hell has been more or less officially
abolished by Dean luge and other eminent
divines, peremptorily bade him carry on
or get out, and Norman got accordingly. Per-
haps he is hardly such an anachronism as he
looks at this distance; it is not many years
since a southron in Scotland who bade a
local inhabitant “good day” on the Sabbath
was liable to be asked freezingly if this was
a day to be talkin’ o’ days.
* * * *
“Talapousi”: Probably the Samoans were
in no way inferior as tattoo artists to the
Maoris and the Marquesas Islanders (B.
14/7/’27), though they paraded their crafts-
manship less. Formerly every youth began
to undergo the process of adornment when
he reached the age of puberty and in many
parts the custom still obtains. The artist
operated from a little below the waist to
several inches down the thighs, and it took
years to accomplish the wonderfully intri-
cate and symmetrical designs of spheres,
angles, lines, scrolls and triangles. The
finished and healed job looked like an ex-
quisitely fine printing of bright blue satin
shorts on the Samoan’s oiled and burnished
skin. In the old days every lad perforce
submitted to the painful process—the higher
his rank the more intricate his pattern—
for no Samoan maiden would look at him
otherwise. But even before the advent of
the missionary the Samoan’s artistic decora-
tions were hidden beneath a loin-cloth of
tappa.

“C.Q.”: Many years ago, when he was
Bananaland’s weather prophet, the enterpris-
ing Clement Wragge induced various
mariners to cast unto the waters sealed bottles
containing particulars of their ships’ posi-
tion, etc., with a view to getting data about
ocean currents. The other day the Common-
wealth meteorologist in Melbourne got one
of these messages from the dead, forwarded
from Stewart Island, M.L. It had been
thrown over from the s.s. Wailiora and had
been 32 years on its travels.
* * * *
“Ottoshoop”: The statement made by a
Boer War veteran in M.L.
that the word “Anzac” was
first coined in South Africa
in 1900 to denote the “Aus-
tralian and New Zealand
Army Contingents” (B.
7/7/’27) is absurd on the
face of it. The ward “Army”
was never used as part of
the designation of any of the
oversea forces in S. Africa.
Furthermore, as soon as we
came under the control of
the Imperial authorities we
ceased officially to be known
as contingents and became
regiments. The Maorilanders
who went into action at
Ottoshoop in August, 1900,
were known as the 4th and
sth N.Z. Regiments. At no
time was there a unit known
as the Australian and New
Zealand Army Contingents.
If anything further were
needed to refute the yarn it
is the reference to the occa-
sion “when Major Anderson
took charge of the Austral-
ian and ' N.Z. forces near
Ottoshoop.” Having served
as an officer in the 4th N.Z.
from start to finish, I can vouch that no
such person as Major Anderson ever took
charge of us.

“Frequent Mariner”: The motor-freighter
Port _ Fremantle, of the Commonwealth and
Dominion line, has just made the fastest pas-
sage on record from London to Melbourne,
via the Cape. The average voyage is 49
days; she did it in 34. The Orient mail-
boat Orvieto left London the same day and
took two days longer over the voyage through
tile Suez Canal. The Orvieto, however,
called at several ports and the Port Fre-
mantle at none. The motor-freighter is a
vessel of 7900 tons gross register, built for
wool and refrigerated cargo. On her trial
run she did 16 knots. Her sister ships are
Port Hobart, Port Dunedin and Port Piria.
The last has just done the trip from New
York to Brisbane via the Panama Canal in
34 days.
# * * *
“Gouger”: Traffic in human skulls (B.
14/7/’27) has gone on for centuries through-
out the Torres Strait islands, right to New
Guinea, though in the Torres Strait groups
the interfering missionary has almost
effected its disappearance. In the earlier
pearling days the trade boomed, the main-
land abo. supplying most of the raw material
for the head-hunters from overseas. The
white man’s skull realised quite a fancy
price because of its scarcity, which added to
the tribulations of shipwrecked mariners in
these cruel coral seas. With the last of the
sou’-east trade winds each year the great
canoes travelled wonderful distances to dis-
pose of the yearly catch, returning at the
beginning of the nor’-west monsoons loaded
with weapons, vegetables, shell money, pigs
and new canoes, all grist- in exchange for
skulls. Even distant New Guinea tribes
were traded with, European skulls especially
being bartered rrom tribe to tribe until they
finally disappeared in the gloomy mountains
of the dread interior. Occasionally the ac-
quisitive traders lost their own skulls in the
business, out that was all in the game.
* * * *
“Kenneless”: Who says we Australians
aren’t superstitious? Going to work the
other morning I bought a tram-ticket with
five sevens on it. Later was offered from
threepence to half-a-crown for it by different
foolish workmates. Being disinclined to
encourage such barbaric nonsense I refused
to sell. Besides, seven is my lucky number,
too.

“Nakhoda”: The enthusiast who scribbles
“Eternity” all over Melbourne (B. 30/6/’27)
is probably a by-product of the organisation
which informs Australia in large letters that
“Millions Now Living Will Never Dio.” The
headquarters of the sect which specialises in
this quaint propaganda work is in the U.S.,
though, being pacifist, it moved to Switzer-
land temporarily when Uncle girded up his
loans and entered the late war. It appears
to have plenty of money to burn; but as
its chief doctrine is that a world cataclysm
is a Divine indication that the end of this
planet is due, it always becomes more vigor-
ous after an earthquake, a revolution or
any other upheaval.

“Lao-dah”: A curiosity in insurance con-
fronted a society in Melbourne the other day.
An agent of the company effected a provi-
sional cover under the industrial section on
a man and three of his children living in a
country town. Before he had time to report
at head office an application for the insur-
ance money arrived. The father and two of
his children had been accidentally drowned
the day after the cover was signed.

“Strict Veg.”: Melbourne Labor circles are
agitating for what is regarded as a much-
needed reform. They want one of the
public gardens for
their Sunday and
Labor day oratory
in lieu of the Yarra
Bank. Despite its
literary fame, the
Yarra Bank is
about the most dis-
mal forum of free
speech ever devised.
It isn’t by the
Yarra and it isn’t a
bank. It is a drear,
wind-swept, grass-
less waste, bounded
on one side by an
asphalt road and
on the other by a
range of brick
m o u n t a in s. It
bears dim evidence
of having once been
laid out in lawns
and rock gardens,
but the lawns have
apparently been
blasted by the
flames of rhetoric
and the rock gar-
dens have all been
thrown at inter-
r u p t e r s. The
screams of the in-
furiated spinsters
who vent their an-
noyance at having
missed the matri-
m o n i a 1 ’bus o n
Bruce and society
at large are lost in
the roar of passing
trains, and the
young men who
lieddle bad Russian
poetry only get
colds in the head.
The proletariat sel-
dom attends in suf-
ficient numbers to
make a respectable
riot, and it would
attend even less if
the philanthropist
who lectures on
venereal diseases
folded up his book
o f gaudy - colored
plates and stole
away. W hether
there would be
more interest in the
“movement” if it
shifted to the Fitzroy Gardens is another
question.

“Nikko”: We had a stormy trip down
from Byron Bay on the Wollongbar a week
or so ago. From the cabin opposite mine
came sounds of one in the direst grip of
mcl de mer : then suddenly, as if pro-
pelled by rage, hate and disappointment, a
bottle shot out of the cabin and landed with
a bang in the passage. I retrieved it later:
it was half-full of what was described on
the label as an infallible cure for seasick-
ness.

“Borom”: The razor is really not a new
weapon for the Sydney street-thug (B.
7/7/’27) ; merely an old one revived. As
long ago as the ’seventies considerable execu-
tion was done with it by two rival racecourse
gangs which had fallen out over a question
of poaching on each other’s blackmailing
preserves. The razor is a terrible weapon
in the hands of an expert, as may be readily
imagined. It is held with the blade doubled
right back so that it is parallel with the
handle, lying on the palm of the hand, be-
tween the fingers and thumb. Otherwise the
wielder runs the chance of losing a finger
or two himself while defacing his foe.
COOTAMUNDRA.
[FOR THE BULLETI.]
July, repenting his austerity
To barren bush and shrub and leafless tree,
Awakened Spring one morning, and cajoled
The sleepy maid to give him soft-spun gold
To deck tile boughs and branches lavishly
On every spreading Cootamundra tree.
And there was one who, frail of form and sad,
Through over-long forgetting to be glad,
Went hollow-eyed, because the skies were
grey,
Unheeding that the Spring was on her way,
Until the yellow clusters she espied,
And plumy, silken branches spreading wide.
’Twas then, with little, eager hands out-
flung
Toward the promise of the year, high-swung,
She said, “It was a wondrous, friendly thing
To set my heart so to remembering”
At which, with sudden burst of turquoise
sky
And dappled, sunlit slopes, smiled old July.

“Spoof”: The proprietor of a travelling
wax-works show has had an experience in a
N.S.W. country town which recalls a pas-
sage in Artemus Ward —in that case it was a
counterfeit presentment of Judas Iscariot
which excited a Utica citizen to wrath and
direct action. The Australian showman was
disturbed by a maniacal commotion in his
chamber of horrors. Investigating, he found
a large and apparently infuriated person
attacking an effigy which, with a bloody razor
in its hand, was bending over several blood-
stained infants (also wax) whose throats it
was supposed to have cut. The enraged icono-
clast was not separated from the waxen
criminal until it looked as if it had been run
through a threshing-machine, and there was a
mighty outcry from the management anent
police and damages, while a raging crowd

paid its money and flocked in hungrily to
gaze on the devastation. Finally, it was
announced that the aggressor had paid, up
and that a new wax assassin would be put in
hand at once. Since then the show is re-
ported to be playing to capacity.

“Downanout”: Can nothing be done to
curb the nuisances who delight in defacing
Nature s beauty spots with their absuul
initials and more preposterous names? On
the track leading to King’s Tableland, over-
looking the beautiful Federal Pass in the
Blue Mountains (N.S.W.), is a natural
stone arch. Inside this arch are shelf-like
formations, and all about are small, flat,
stone tablets and slivers of rock, splintered
off during the making of the track. It
appears to have occurred to some benighted
tourist that his name and address would
ornament one of these slabs; after duly
inscribing “T.Z.R., Gladesville,” or some-
thing to that effect, he places his contribu-
tion to art on one of the shelves, as one
would a photograph on the domestic mantel.
The idea has caught on so well that the
shelves are beginning to resemble the letter-
delivery section of the G.P.O. “Bill Jones.
Randwick,’’ rubs shoulders with “Anastasia
McFayden,” neatly inscribed within a heart
rampant. “Nurse Blank’s” card is placed
suggestively near the inscription of a gentle-
man, over 40, strict teetotaller, who wants
a wife, good-looking, own income, no others
need apply. The falls crash out their age-
old song, the winds play leapfrog through the
gums in the valley and beat against the
dizzy faces of the mighty yellow cliffs, and
further up the track “J.T., Beggs-street,
West Maitland,” shuts up his penknife, care-
fully brushes the leaves from his trousers,
and goes on his way, conscious of having
done something to preserve his name for
posterity.

“J.G.”: Many people think that the South-
ern Cross on the Australian flag is a copy
of that which once waved over Peter Lalor
and his Eureka Stoekaders. But a glance
at the historic Eureka flag in the Ballarat
Art Gallery shows how erroneous is this im-
pression. Lalor’s flag was a blue one, with
a wide white cross similar in shape to the
red St. George’s cross upon the Union Jack.
The stars of the Southern Cross were set
around the cross. The old so-called N.S.W.
ensign (a white flag, blue cross, and cross
of stars) was of the same design as the
flag of Eureka, but the colors were reversed.
I have been told that the Southern Cross now
appearing upon the Australian flag was bor-
rowed from the old unofficial Victorian
ensign. This in turn was taken from the
flag of the Young Australian Legion founded
in the early days of Tasmania by parson
John West, which was flown fully a decade
before the Eureka fight. Parson John spent
his latter years on the S. M. Hekald.

“Wang”: Mention of “Wheelbarrow
Jimmy” (B. 30/6/’27) reminds me of a
quaint old couple who earned a peripatetic
living around the outer suburbs of Mel-
bourne some years ago. The old man did
tinkering jobs and repaired doormats; his
missus used to canvas for orders, and was
not above doing a bit of scrubbing or any-
thing of the sort that offered. Their worldly
possessions were carted about in an old-
fashioned tliree-wlieeled wicker pram, which
Dad pulled while Mum gave a hand behind.
A third member of the outfit was a big
half-bred kelpie dog; a small pannier-like
arrangement strapped across his back, car-
ried the old man’s soldering-irons and the
implements and material for mat-mending,
They were an appealing and hard-working
trio, and I wish some artist had caught
them before they wheeled their old pram
off its beat.

This year the many speeches were mostly
studiously light in tone. Prince Henry pro-
fessed to know nothing of art, and to confuse

“C. Coral”: The little speck at the top of
Cape York marked Thursday Island will
have a jubilee this year. The first settlement
was formed in 1863 at Somerset, but a shift
was made in 1877 to Thursday Island. H. M.
Chester was the first Government resident,
coming across from Somerset with a small
retinue of police and other officials; it was
he who was later sent to hoist the flag in
New Guinea for the Imperial Government.

has been digging up old records of early
settlement in anticipation of the coming cele-

“Lightning J.”: The greatest fault I have
to find with amateur radio broadcasters is
the slovenly way they murmur their call
signs. It is rather disappointing, after get-
ting particularly good reception, to hear the
station’s call mouthed in such a way that
leaves one in doubt whether it is the youth
next door saying good-bye to his best girl
or a football mob hooting an umpire who
is being conducted from the ground by police
troopers.

“Feng-Shui”: A Malay who ran amok in
Perak, F.M.S., recently grew tired of firing
at sitting or walking game, and after killing
five people in his village, went on to the
main road to pot at passing motorists. His
first bag was the driver of a motor-lorry, the
vehicle itself turning head over heels. He
next picked off a taxi-driver and his fare, the
car also turning turtle. His fourth victim
was a private motorist, and he was still
enjoying himself in a way undreamed of by
his ancestors when the police arrived. Despite
this spectacular affair, the amok as a
means of expressing one’s grievances is stead-
ily going out of fashion. At one time the
native who went off his head in this san-
guinary manner was regarded like a mad dog,
and the populace fell on him and wiped him
out, and he died untidily but gloriously in
battle. Now the authorities carefully gather
him up, bring him into court and try him
according to the prosaic way of British
justice. It is a drab and sordid ending; so
nowadays the native, whose wife has been
stolen by a Chinaman goes to his solicitor.

When you find yourself in a hell of a hole
With a cartload of grief in store,
One thing sticks out —and it doesn’t console —•
That it never happened before.
It never happened to you, that is,
But listen a moment and hark:
A million blokes have been through that mill,
And a million blokes will go through it sti 11,
Though you mayn’t have dreamt that they
did or will—
And a million’s under the mark.
Is it lawless love dr the cash you stole
That hobbles your heart with care?
That damned dilemma, entire and whole,
Has happened sometime, somewhere,
Has happened sometime, somewhere, dear
boy,
To sinners who worried through;
There’s some were craven and some were
bold;
Some were passionate, some were cold,
But whatever they did, what they did is old ;
Though it seems so uew to you.
So bite on your bullet and play your role,
Though it’s hard as hell to play,
And you’ll somehow get to some sort of a
goal,
For life works out that way.
It always works out that way, dear boy,
To earth’s remotest, shore.
So catch the sob and stifle the groan
While you reap the harvest that you have
sown.
On the track you're treading that seems so

There’ve been millions of feet before.

The directors call the year’s profit £23,134;
the balance is an addition to replacement
reserve, and how much, if any, of that is
true profit it is impossible to say. If that
fund doesn’t consist of true profits—that
is to say, accumulated earnings in excess of
depreciation—then the actual reserves are
£69,350 less than the amount mentioned in
the table. Results have been irregular; but
the 8 p.c. aimed at has been paid through-
out, though sometimes the shareholders have
had to wait for it. The co. works under
disadvantages so far as labor is concerned ;
on the other hand it has the enormous ad-
vantage of being in an industry which has
the extraordinarily powerful C.S.R. at its
head; moreover, because it is the one great
tropical industry Australia possesses,
national policy demands that it shall be
maintained in a state of reasonable pros-
perity. The chances are that, whatever the
C.S.R. may do, people like the Fairymead
will never be allowed to make or at least
continue to make very large profits; but
their chances of being protected in making
fair profits are better than most people’s.
For the same reason the co. is likely to be
careful not to show its position or its results
as better than they really are.
Judging by balance-sheet figures there has
been no lack of enterprise:—

Sugar stocks,
book debts, etc. 88,263 46,070 18,667 37,287
Surplus profits, though they have been sub-
stantial, have thus not been sufficient to
finance the additions to estates and plant;
and the liabilities are now more than half
as great as the capital—£93,lBo of the total
is owing to the bank. From this one might
suspect that, though the co. has probably
done quite as well as it admits, it hasn’t
done a very great deal better. During last
year it lost the services of Charles Ernest
Young, the last of the original managing
directors; but there are still four of the
family on the board, and two of the second
generation have followed their fathers as
managing directors. The market regards the
8 p.c. as a pretty sure thing, and is pre-
pared to bid 235. for the shares. The net
book-value of the assets is a shilling or so
more than that even if the replacement re-
serve is written off the plant, etc.; but
this is a case in which many of the assets
wouldn’t have much value if the wheels
stopped turning.

Foreign competition and increasing costs
have thrown the timber trade of Australia
into a deep sea of trouble; and the State
Child Endowment law will make the task
of N. S. Wales cos. still more difficult. Allen
Taylor’s co. occupies a stronger position
than most; yet the,later entries in the table
show how serious the position is even
there —no div. at all has been paid in respect
of the last half-year. Had the co.’s trade
not been chiefly in heavy timber, which is
least affected by overseas competition, the
figures must certainly have been worse. Its
shipping activities give it an advantage,
though; also it is in a position to make
prompt purchases and shipments from pro-
ducing centres, thus freeing it of the necessity
of carrying heavy stocks. And its manage-
ment has succeeded in winning contracts with
a regularity that sometimes has puzzled rival
cos. But while the co. has not suffered from
overseas competition as most other timber
merchants have done, the extension of con-
crete into large and small bridgework and the
use of steel as uprights and beams in con-
struction work generally have limited Allen
Taylor’s field, and will go on limiting it.
The co. has reserves of £43,000 invested out-
side the business, but the future is still so
full of uncertainty that optimism at this
stage would be inexcusable.
Balance-sheet figures are good, considering
the nature of the business: —

“Cash, investments, etc.,” of the table in-
clude the reserve fund investments, which
consist of public securities, deposits and
shares in public cos. Prior to the hard times,
additions to the fund were made regularly,
but there has been no movement in the past
three years. According to the report the
assets of the co. have been reviewed and
valued, and depreciation allowed. Country
sawmills, etc.—a hefty item —are said to have
been “carefully valued.” But the value of
country mills is greatly influenced by indus-
trial and other legislation; a comparatively
small addition to costs would reduce the
real value of some plant from thousands to
nothing. With that qualification tangible
assets at May 31 were equal to 265. 6d. for
each of the 150,000 £1 shares. Latest
quotations were buyers, 195.; sellers, 19s. 3d.
The market certainly doesn’t over-estimate
the co.’s difficulties.

There was a reflex of the drought over
much of the area served by this co. in the
slightly lessened profit disclosed for the 12
months. The dry spell means a severe cur-
tailment of spending in most lines, but it
increases the demands in others, chiefly in
produce and meal foods. The extremes of
climate in Central Queensland, however, pro-
duce great prosperity no less than severe set-
backs, and the co. that makes provision for
the famines and can see them through wins
gilded results in the years of plenty. Almost
at the beginning of its career, Reid’s struck
the devastating drought of 1902, which
brought it, no less than many of its clients,
face to face with ruin. The experience was
not forgotten. Solid reserves have been
accumulated. “Your directors,” they report,
“have built up a bad and doubtful debts re-
serve which is more than sufficient to cover
any loss which a prolongation of the drought
conditions may bring about.” Balance-sheet
figures certainly reflect the silver lining:—

Trade creditors could see cash, stock, and
book debts amounting to £447,902, and the
greater portion of “Properties, A.U.S.N. Co.,
Ltd., shares, War Loans, etc., £153,615,”
consists of Government stocks. The office
pessimist must have been given the freedom
of the books when the value of the properties
was written in.
Recent divs. have been declared at 10 p.c.,
with the extras, labelled “bonus,” paid from
accrued War Loan interest, free of both
Federal and State taxation. Given freedom
from anything in the way of disaster, the
12$ p.c. looks like a minimum. Visible re-
serves are almost eoual to capital—inciden-
tally, this Column does not include the insur-
ance reserve, although it suspects that it is
profit—and properties have been written
down heavily. Recent sales of the shares
were at 345., which, on the basis of 12$ p.c.
divs., returns 7’. p.c. Gift issues account for
£145,000 of the capital, but the market has
apparently decided that nothing in that line
is meditated at the moment. Each of the

Sales were one-seventh more than in the
previous term, and the extra 1 p.c. on ordi-
naries was justified by the profits; never-
theless in view of the presence of goodwill
(£22,682) in the accounts, and the wisdom
of building up reserves, the 9 p.c. must be
viewed as on the liberal side. Thus far, £9548
has been visibly accumulated, which leaves
£13,134 of capital still unrepresented by
assets that you can take in your hands.
Last year’s results justify the directors’
policy of expansion, and their confidence in
the future may be completely confirmed; but
advantage needs to be taken in these pro-
sperous—and prodigal—times to provide
against the not-so-good years which must be
ahead.

£53,033; 1926, £5!),569; this year, £73,769.
Expenditure has been kept under control, but
experimental legislation will not make the
path of this, or any other co., easy going.
The establishment of a suburban branch and
the increase of certain departments were re-
sponsible for last year’s larger figures. To
finance these developments the co. visited its
bankers, overdraft amounting to £8494 at
April 30. Also sundry creditors increased by
£13,940 to £44,344. On the other side, the
broader trading was evident in the expansion
of stocks from £39,101 to £60,650, and of
book debts from £52,187 to £63,550. Land and
premises and plant were in at a few thousand
more than at the previous balance. Property,
plant and machinery are stated to be in
first-class condition, adequate depreciation
written off leasehold property and wasting
assets, and stock in hand conservatively
valued. Both classes of shares are listed,
and there is some trading in prefs. Their 9
p.c. is only a small charge on earnings; last
year’s net profit was almost eight times the
amount necessary. Security is good, net
tangible assets being equal to £5 2s. 2d. per
share. Prefs. have changed hands at 235.
9d., at which price the return is 7-f p.c.

There is mention in the report of econo-
mies “effected since December,” and share-
holders are asked to look for the result at
next balance —it certainly isn’t visible in this
one. There is talk also of the amalga-
mation of S. Aus. cos. in this business, and
“it is hoped that later on something in this
direction will be accomplished.” That hope
has been held out before and nothing has
come of it; but hard times may make a dif-
ference. Amalgamation should certainly be
valuable; apart altogether from the removal
of the cut-tliroat competition it should make
economies in operating costs. There are
seasons when it doesn’t pay to work certain
areas; if the whole lot were under one con-
trol these would be left alone for the time
and operations concentrated on the others.
On paper, the position, needless to say,
did not improve :

Stocks were worked down ; but a lot depends
on how the rest was valued. Trading debts
increased, but, thanks to the reduction of
stocks, almost £7500 was cut off the bank
overdraft. All things considered, there
shouldn’t be any overdraft. But the co. was
too liberal with profits when earnings were
fairly good; and when a few thousand re-
serves had been accumulated they were
passed out to shareholders with a rush,
though it is to be doubted if in its most
affluent year there were any real reserves—
that is, realisable assets in excess of capital.
There certainly isn’t much in the outlook
for shareholders to pin their hopes to except
the economies talked of and the possibilities
of amalgamation.

It looks like the end. The report of E. E.
Barker, the American expert, was definitely
against trying to work the show as an open-
cut proposition with power-shovels: high
wages and too few working days made profit
impossible. Liquidation seems inevitable;
and shareholders were given early warning
that realisation would return more than the
market value of the shares. Production last
year wag largely in connection with the
experimental work and the result was the
heavy loss of £137,300 (£72,837 for 1!)26),
which net returns on investments reduced to
£35,518. Here are the latest figures and a

Tyldesley Colliery, Ltd. (N.S.W.) :
This co. came on to the market in October.
1924, but despite the small amount —£25,000
-—sought from the public, it must have moved
slowly off the stocks: first accounts were to
April 30, 1926. Output of 450 tons per
day, a life of 80 years and 10 p.c. divs. were
featured in the prospectus. As the co. took
over a working mine with 2844 acres of
mining leases and 78 acres of mining purpose
leases, some of the claims did not seem
extravagant. Last year shareholders re-
ceived 10 p.c., but as the balance-sheet has
not yet been cleared of intangibles, the action
seems 4o have optimism rather than prudence
as a basis. Preliminaries cost £1462, and
£146 has been written off in each term.
If that percentage is adhered to, the accounts
will present an untidy appearance for some
time. On this occasion £996 appears for
Great Western mines rescue station —a neces-
sity under the new Act. That item, too,
should be written off out of earnings. Last
year profits improved by £1100; the increase
was put down to mine improvements, making
greater output possible. A scheme at present
under consideration is expected to result in
still further increase. The mine property
appeared at £30.505 compared with £29.594.
and everything depends upon the provision
which has been allowed against the time
when all that will represent the colliery will


CLOUD
SHIPS
BY E.J.B. Brady
[For Tub Bulletin.]
h ull grey hath given place to green;
The morn with bird-song thrills,
And cloud-ships idly drift between
The Inlet and the Hills.
In childhood hours I loved to lie
Upon a ledge I knew,
And watch them sailing, sailing by,
Along that upward blue.
Some drifted from a gallant strand
That girdles Arcady,
And some had come from Fairyland
In joyous argosy.
My white cloud fleets! I loved them so
Who watched them sailing on
With silver masts and sails of snow
For distant Avalon!
They lightly touch the waving trees,
Across the clearings glide,
While drone the drowsy honey bees
And faintly laps the. tide.
They race across the shining sands
And darkly meet the sea,
To set their course for other lands
Unknown to you or me.
These skyward ships, that rarely rest
By either night or day,
Still freight my fancies East or . West
To some glad port away.
I wonder, when the days are done,
If lifted souls may be
By these white squadrons carried on
To dream in Arcady?

made for depreciation, though the amount is

to property account, notwithstanding con
siderable additions to plant and mine im-
provements, suggests that a good deal m

lias been paid for out of earnings. Bu
for this the small sum written off preliminary

that the management is too much concerned

Last week-end the London quotation was
£22 16s. 3d.; forward £23 6s. 3d., which sug-
gests that the swing-back has been a bit too
sudden. Still there is no hope in the figures
of production and consumption, especially
the American figures; production has got
well ahead of requirements lately, the boom
prices having lifted the lid off scores ot
shut-down mines. The position with regard
to zinc is much the same. The Wild Cat
has repeatedly pointed out what a pound tail
in the two metals meant. Thus the total
lead content of the B. H. South s lead
concentrates alone last year was 34,5-5
tons, and the zinc content of the zinc con-
centrates 37,145 tons.

“Shareholder”: South Lucknow is send-
ing its third parcel of ore (about 31 tons)
to Germany. Local treatment is subject to
high wages', short hours, heavy compensation
insurance and, now, child endowment. Ger-
many is apparently still supreme metallur-
gically; skill in treatment and the absence
of the handicaps mentioned enable its
smelters to give the utmost value, whereas
locally the tendency seems to be for the pur-
chaser to provide for all sorts of contin-
gencies—he doesn’t know what will hit lum
next.

The progress which has been made, in the
practice of tin smelting in Australia is illus-
trated by the arrival of a consignment of
tin concentrates from Bolivia, South
America, for treatment at Lempriere’s works
(Sydney) ; and regular supplies are expected.
Hitherto the business has gone to either
Germany or Britain.

There is little interest in oil these days.
Taranaki rejected the proposal of the Anglo-
Persian offshoot regarding an option over
portion of its area in M.L. S.A. Oilwells. is
plugging away. It issues regular bulletins
of its progress to the “oil sands.” A report
of a flow at Belford Dome (N.S.W.) was so
obviously incorrect that it did not occasion
even humorous comment. Of the Papuan
cos. New Guinea Oil is making a gallant
fight to avert a close-down ; Ormildah reports
its bore down to 1530 ft. with a good “show-
ing” of gas at 1423 ft.; and from the others
is mostly silence.

Oroya Links’s decision' to separate the
investment side of its business from the
mining side and form an Investment Trust
Go. isn’t a hasty one. The, matter has been
under consideration for a year or two, and
was mentioned to shareholders by chairman
Cordner James at a meeting held in August
last. James said that financiers associated
with other successful trusts were agreeable
to provide £200,000, and if Oroya Links
found a further £lOO,OOO they were willing
to give Oroya Links shareholders the right
to subscribe an additional £5O 000. James
added that if the Tanks found £lOO,OOO it
would still have £30,000 left for the purposes
of its present mining enterprise, and if future
results were unprofitable and the co. gave up,
the investment-trust holding could be dis-
tributed to shareholders to form a substan-
tial capital return in respect of their present
interests.

Monte Carlo (W.A.) is in sad plight with
its latest option at Glenelg. Holders of about
50.000 shares threw* in their scrip and the
prospect of funds from calls vanished. In a
desperate effort the option held on the pro-
perty has been pawned to keep going in the
hope that a rich patch may be struck. As
the co. still owes £4OOO on its option it looks
as if even the speculative uncle is taking r
risk.
Some old copper mines in the Roebourne
district (W.A.) are to be reopened by London
owners. Small lots of rich stuff have been
dug in the past, but the rich patches occur so
infrequently that with sky-high costs and cop-
per at its present low price prospects of
profits are not bright.
Gt. Boulder (W.A.) is slowly but surely
being overrun by tributors. They are num-
erous in the upper levels of the main work-
ings and still more numerous in the eastern
sections. The co. is pottering about here
and there and complains that want of funds
prevents it doing a lot more. This complaint,
coming from a concern which has paid sev-
eral millions in divs., doesn’t win much sym-
pathy.

Graphite. Ltd., which has five leases in
the hundred of May, north of South Aus.,
intends to start on a 100-tons-a-day scale
shortly. The biggest ore body so far dis-
covered on the property has been partly
proved by drilling and workings to contain
about 63,000 tons, from which 11 p.c. of
flake graphite assaying about 83 p.c. carbon
is recoverable. Good showings have been
exposed in other workings. The claim is
seven miles from the shipping point. A
potential difficulty lies in the fact that some
of the Hake is built up of mica and graphite
interlaminated. Another trouble is that
Madagascar can dump very cheap graphite
into this or any other unprotected country.
A. W. Wincey is in charge.

South New Moon, Eagleliawk (Vic.), has
gone to the scrap-heap. The machinery has
been auctioned for £2OOO, and the death war-
rant of a mine which has produced consider-
ably over £1,000,000 worth of gold and paid
£500,000 in divs. lias beeen executed. The
New Moon, adjoining, raised another
£1,000,000 and paid divs. for 14 years; its
reef in one place was 120 ft. wide. South
Moon ended up by owing the State Govern-
ment about £lO,OOO. Calls were made up to
nearly £50,000.

An attempt to re-open a quicksilver mine
at Jamieson (Vic.) is being made. T. H. Jus-
tice, of Jamieson, who made £200,000 out
of gold at Woods’ Point, has held _the lease
ever since he opened the mine in 1895. Arthur
G. Holroyd, the Melbourne Uni. engineer,
chemist and geologist, the man who first
found tellurium in the Kalgoorlie ores and
thereby transformed the Great Boulder mul-
lock-tip into one of the woidd’s richest fields,
examined and reported upon the Jamieson
quicksilver mine in 1901, since when no
work has been done. Holroyd’s report and
plans were sent to London, and there prob-
ably the float was killed by agents of the
quicksilver monopoly. A report in the Aus-
tralian Quicksilver Mining Co.’s prospectus
repeats Holroyd’s figures and mentions a
report by the late O. A. L. Whitelaw, a
well-known field geologist, without giving
his name. When this writer saw the mine
some years ago it was full of water. The
hill alongside is worth prospecting for gold
because it is composed of Kalgoorlie schists.
Oueensland’s gold return for June was
52480 z., valued at £22,292, compared with
43420 z. worth £18,444 for June, 1926. The
half-year yielded 12,5540 z. worth £53.326, as
against 45160 z. worth £19,186 for the same
period last year. Mt. Morgan’s raid on
reserve and siliceous ores is. responsible for
the increase. The old mine contributed
42620 z. of the June total, the other returns
being hardly worth mentioning.

“N.M.L.” asks for his share: —
I note (B. 9/6/’27)) that the authorities contem-
plate the offering of rewards to drillers in W.
Queensland for reports of oil in bores. I’m not a
driller, but here’s my contribution. In the deep
bore on Bimerah (W.Q.), sunk some time in the
’nineties, the second in charge of that plant informed
me that after going about 2000 ft. they never pur-
chased any lubricating oil for the plant. All they
wanted came up in the sludge. Fifty or sixty miles
south-west of that, on Warbreccan station, on an-
other deep bore —4500 ft.—the smell of kerosene is
most pronounced. So much so that it seems risky
to strike a match in the steam of that bore when
the vapor is heavy on a winter morning. A silly
fear, of course. In the “sub.” bore on Elderslie,
great globules of black oil came up at every running
of the sand pump, and in addition semi-transparent
stones were recovered which, wet as they were,
burnt freely when a match was applied.

“Uramao’’: The closing of the gates of the
big dam at Kawarau (M.L.), on June 10,
caused no excitement comparable with last
year’s event, when motor-car parties from
all over the Dominion, and some interested
visitors from Australia, attended in the ex-
pectation of seeing gold glittering in the dry
bed of the river and went away dis-
appointed. The conditions this year were
better for the closing, but the hope of laying-
bare the bed was not realised. The engi-
neers are devising means for the removal of
rocks and other obstacles which cause the
water to collect in ponds instead of escaping.
Until this is done it looks as if claimholders
will have to possess their souls in patience.

Guinea Gold’s new share issue may be

Three of Alluvial Tin’s subsidiaries have
issued their reports for the year ended
December 31. Malim Nawar South began
dredging in September, 1926, and in four
months treated 348,000 cubic yards for 58
tons tin oxide worth £9792, and showing a
working profit of £2075 and a net £1044 after
writing off preliminary exes. Since the
close of the financial year the dredge has
been winning good though variable results.
June, for instance, showed a drop of 15
tons from May’s GO tons. Hours worked
were almost the same for both months and
yardages were 161,000 in June and 148.000
in May—doubtless the June figures included
some of the deep overburden which covers
this property. The dredge’s performance in
the very deep ground has realised all expec-
tations, save the estimated turnover of
160,000 yards per month. However, by the
end of May £12,963 owing to associated
cos. had been paid off, and a shilling div.
(£6500) had been banded out. The co. has not
yet fulfilled its prospectus promises, but can
safely be rated as sound, given fair metal
prices. Capital is £130,000 in £1 shares,
all fully paid.
Kundang has been a disappointment so far.
Production began early this year with a
120,000-yard dredge. Working 398 hours in
January, 17 tons were recovered from 60,000
yards. A recovery of 30 tons was estimated
to ensure a profit of £3OOO with tin at the
high rates ruling then. The June return
was 'll tons, worth £1983 and won at an
approximate cost of £1866. Much buried
timber is said to be among the unexpected
difficulties; whatever the cause, the dredge
does not seem able to get in a full month’s
work. The value of the ground is not far
from Malcolm Newman’s estimate of .751 b.,
though it has cost a lot to get.
Changkat, another of Alluvial Tin’s pups
in the Kinta Valley, hopes to have its
180, 000-yard dredge going in November.
Buckets will be 12 c. ft. capacity and dig 60
feet, with jigs and classifiers. First results
are being anxiously awaited, for the propo-
sition is given a great name by its admirers.
The area is 450 acres and rather hard to get
at; a big expenditure on roadmaking was
necessary. Newman estimates 30,000,000 c.y.
in the area —nine million yards containing
2Jlb. per yd., the balance 41b. ground. Depth
averages 60 feet with soft granite bottom,
and an all-round return of at least lib. per
c.y. is expected. Nominal capital had to be
increased from £120,000 to £130,000 to meet
constructional costs. On Dec. 31 paid capital
showed as £119,912, with creditors £1923.
On paper this looks easily the best of Allu-
vial Tin’s propositions.
* * * *
Austral Malay subsidiaries show fairly
good figures for the first half of the month.
Kampong Kamunting, with 43 tons from
62,000 yards, reads uncommonly well—the
•Tune figures were 81 tons from 145,000
yards. Asam Kumbang is behind last month’s
average with 26 tons from 55,000 yards—
it was 62 tons from 86,000 yards last month.
TTlu Yam, 20 tons from 55,000 yards, is
also running late. Thabawleik has improved
with 21 tons from 32,000 yards for the
fortnight against 32 tons for the whole of
last month. The dredge is still not within
coo-ee of the 100,000 c.y. estimate.
Ronpibon’s 12 tons from 60,000 yards is
about the June average, when 21 working
days were lost and 11 tons recovered. The
May return of 45 tons from 125,000 yards,
in a working run of 629 hours, can be taken
as a fair sample of this proposition’s per-
formance when nothing goes wrong. Kuala
Lumpur, with 20 tons for June, reports 12
tons for the July half-month, from 38,000
yards. The new dredge, to start at the end
of this year, should show better recoveries.
Tin Bentong, with 10.1 tons from 45,000
yards, slips in comparison with the .June
36| tons from 76,500 yards. Much of the
richest portion of this co.’s property has
been exhausted, but there is plenty of pay-
able ground yet in sight. Directors are,
however, seeking new fields and are sitting
tight on profits.
In the first half of July Takuapa, whose
total June harvest was 27 tons, turned over
55,000 c.y. and won 27 tons—not far short of
1 l-61b. to the yard from country estimated
to average 13oz. to 14oz. Takuapa’s dredge
is one of the most modern in Malaya; a
second dredge of the same type but slightly
larger—No. l’s capacity is 150,000yd5., but
it has not yet been attained —is expected
to be at work by December. The co. holds
900 acres under lease, and 1700 acres under
prospecting license, in Western Siam. The
ground lias given little trouble and, so long
as tin holds at or better than £250 London,
good profits should continue. Four Is. divs.
were handed out in 1926. The decision to
acquire another dredge hung up the April,
1927, distribution. There are 215,000 shares
f.-p. and 35,000 paid to 15s. each. These
last were issued in March, 1920, at a pre-
mium of ss.
Phin Soon is an open-cast mine. Long
worked by the Chinese, it was taken over
by the Malay-Siamcse Prospecting Co. in
1926. Ilaad Yai is another of its shows.
The market is waiting results from the co.'s
new Werf Conrad dredge, which is expected
to dig in about September next. There are
sellers at 295. Phin Soon is in the Ivintn
Valley district, and a drastic reorganisation
of management and plant was found neces-
sary some months ago, after directors had
visited the mine. The co. reports a return
of 8.33 tons for the first half of July. No
yardage figures are given, and the run is
probably from the “pilot” plant which en-
gineer H. V. Seale suggested installing some
months ago as a test of the ground’s capa-
city to support a bigger plant. In any
case, Phin Soon, with boring tests alleged
to vary from 1.321 b. to 5.231 b. in the “un-
worked ground,” is still in the problematical
stage. There is a lot of heavy clay, and
open-cast mining is notoriously expensive,
while labor is said to be growing scarcer.
It is too far advanced in the open-cast stage
for dredge-working. Modern and improved
methods seem to be the show’s only hope.


£lO,OOO or £lOO
can be profitably invested in this proposition
Metropolitan Underwriters (Australasia), Ltd., is one of the few propositions which appeal equally to the large or to the
small investor. Whether the amount available for investment is £lO,OOO or only £lOO, there are few avenues offering such

existence of Underwriting Companies which control the world s parity.
There is a wide field in Australasia now for an Underwriting Company, with sufficient capital, controlled by men of
experience. This the first nationally-organised Underwriting Company in Australasia must develop with extraordinary
rapidity. Controlled as it is by men of ability and wide experience it will provide an unprecedented return to its investors.

John Garvan’s associates would certainly
have booked him as something better than
a first-class life; yet he died at 54. Of
splendid physique, he kept himself fit for
hard work by hard play—he was a dashing
poloist and played a hard game of tennis
when he was 50. His brain was extraordin-
arily clear, and it worked with amazing
rapidity; and because he had a deep
study of currency and exchange the Com-
monwealth Government appointed him chair-
man of the Notes Board which controlled
Australia’s currency and advised the Gov-
ernment as to its finances during the war.
The value of his services was not seen until
long afterwards. He did great work later
as chairman of directors of the Common-
wealth Bank; and the Mutual Life and
Citizens’ Assurance Office is a fine monument
to his father, who founded it, and to the
son, who, taking hold of it when lie was 23,
remained its managing director for 31 years.
Artist Syd Long, who merely scraped
along in Australia, but achieved fame in
England, is back in Sydney and finds it hard
to tear himself away
from the sunshine.
He lately sent three
etchings to the
Royal . Etchers’
Exhibition in Lon-
don too late for
inclusion, as it hap-
pened and has
just had word that
they were passed on
to the Royal
Academy, which
promptly hung all
three. When Long
sold some of his pic-
tures to the Sydney
Gallery he was
given an extra
guinea for copy-
right, and reproduc-
tions of his pictures
—“Flamingoes” is
the most popular—
now meet his eye
on calendars and
other advertising
stationery wherever
he turns in Aus-
tralia.
KEN WILLIAMS,
Muoritand'a
Minister of
Public w orks.
Speaker Snowball’s decision on the first
point of order raised under his jurisdiction
in Vic. Assembly made the House chuckle
with delight. Jackson, the perky seat-
holder for Praliran, interjected while ex-
Premier Allan was getting off a breezy piece
on the Address-in-Reply, and the interrupted
one retorted that he would not go to a
whipper-snapper like the suburbanite for in-
formation. Mr. Speaker told Allan that he
would “have to withdraw the whipper-snap-
per.'’ Allan complied, whereupon Jackson
queried, “Then, I'm not a whipper-snapper?”
“Not now,” answered the man in the wig.
Queensland lost one of its best-known
mineralogists last week when Edward A.
Derrick died: 20 years ago he went north
from the Sale (Vic.) School of Mines, where
he had been science-master, and, after a
spell in the Cairns district, settled down
with his pots and his balances in Brisbane
—incidentally for some years keeping track
of Queensland mining movements for The
Bulletin’s “Wild Cat.” Appendicitis ended
a useful life, though he was always more
of a student and a dreamer than a man of
affairs.
Bob Greig, Chairman of Committees in
N.S.W. Legislative Assembly, will be miss-
ing from the next Parliament. Like ex-
Attorney-General McTiernan, lie did not seek
a Labor nomination, but his explanation
would have been different from McTiernan’s,
had he elected to publish one. Speaker
Dooley may himself be an absentee when
the new House meets. He is threatened
with a very rough spin in the selection
ballot for Hartley.
Despite the strong protest made by Vic.
Labor when ex-Seuator Drake-Brockman was
appointed a Federal Arbitration Court judge,
the party has placed one of its own stal-
warts, A. W. Foster, on the Country Court
Bench as a deputy judge. Just before being
sworn in, its nominee had to resign a senior
vice-presidency of the A.L.P. and an appoint-
ment as a Trades Hall delegate. Foster is
41, and has been 19 years at the Bar. He
read for a while with Starke, J., of the
High Court. He has tried, unsuccessfully,
to enter the Federal and State Parliaments.
Mrs. J. S. Litchfield, whose name has beeu
at the foot of a good many Red Page articles,
was the only woman candidate for three seats
on the Darwin Council. She was third when
the first preferences were counted, but on
further counts she dropped out of the race.
Curiously, the third place went to a man who
on the first count had only a single vote. The
top-sawyer (Brogan) had GO.
“Issy” Smith, the first Jewish V.C., can
claim an unusual experience. He played the
war game in earnest between 1914-18 and he
has played in over 20 British war films. One
of them is “Mademoiselle from Armentieres,”
now showing in Melbourne, where “Issy” is
living.
The Prohibitionists have brought the Rev.
James Barr, M.P. for Motherwell, to Aus-
tralia, and the Rev. James has brought
the thrilling news that the Glasgow City
Corporation “Ims decided not to use intoxi-
cating liquor at any public receptions.”
Whether conviction or economy dictated the
change is not quite clear. The reverend
legislator is an M.C. of Glasgow Uni., and
has been a minister for 38 years-—he will be
65 on July 26. He used to be a Liberal,
but crossed to the Labor party, as did most
of the Scottish Liberals, though some are
now returning to the old love.
N.S.W.’s oldest living ex-Governor, Lord
Carrington (nowadays Marquis of Lincoln-
shire), had an 84th birthday party the other
day.
William Davis, who was a circumstance
at Gympie in the roaring days of the field,
has defied the dreadful climate of Queensland
for 62 years. He was 18 when he arrived
in Australia, a Taffy from Carmarthenshire.
He accumulated garth and gear at Gympie
and became a director of many companies,
including the Q.N. Bank. Of late years
lie has been domiciled in Brisbane, where
the kirk takes up most of his latter-day
interests.
Old-hands in Macquarie-street, Sydney, are
wondering how the Legislative Assembly will
get on for unconscious humorists now that
T. 11. Hill, M.L.A. for Oxley, is retiring,
with a Parthian shot at “Nationalism” and
its pi’e-selection methods, and Cecil Murphy
has been reduced to quitting the North Shore
for Paddington, where the odds are heavily
against him. Hill’s career as unconscious
humorist began when he was christened
Theodore Hook, after the maddest of wags
of his generation. Nothing delighted the
hard cases of the House more than to in-
veigle him into an argument on industrial
legislation with Murphy, and to hear him
repeat for the edification of that loud-voiced
little man that N. S. Wales was destined
to Fall, like Rome. All the same, the old
chap had the courage of his convictions,
which is more than can be said for a lot of
his colleagues.
Dr. Eustace Ferguson, dead in Sydney after
a long illness, was a naturalist and patholo-
gist of more than Australian reputation. A
president of the N. S. Wales Zoological
Society and also of the Linnean Society, lie
achieved fame as an all-round naturalist,
specialising in medicinary entomology, on
which he was a high authority. He found
time, too, to do his bit in the Great War,
serving as a medical officer with the forces
in Palestine. He was only 43 at the end.
The Sydney firm of John Sands has lost
the most ancient of its old inhabitants in
William Billerwell. At 12 he was appren-
ticed to the original John Sands, and he
remained in the service for 72 years. Another
veteran has been in the firm’s employment
for 60 years, and another for half a century.
J. N. Ratcliffe, winner of the Queensland
amateur golf championship, is a master at
Southport School, an institution designed on
the lines of the N.S.W. Great Public Schools,
and the only one of its kind in Queensland,
lie is an Oxford man.
J. A. MURDOCH, a well-known Sydney
business man, who makes a hobby of
civic reform and the magnificent Burn-
side orphan homes outside Parramatta
Thomas Coates, of Kaipara, Maoriland,
uncle of the Priminister, passed out at SO the
other day. He was a Herefordshire laddie
and with iiis brother Edward, father of the
head of the Government, went to M.L. in
1866, when he was 19. The brothers took up
land and introduced Shropshire Downs to
Fernland.
Snowball is likely to make quite a popular
Speaker of Vic. Assembly. In spite of his
fiery speeches at L.O.L. demonstrations, the
Assembly knows him as a kindly and com-
panionable chap. But his health is still frail
after his trying experience of 1925.
Walter Burley Griffin, the Yankee archi-
tect who made the prize design for the Fed-
eral Capital—it has been altered a lot —has
also carried off the prize for the only other
town plan submitted for international com-
petition, the remodelling of Shanghai. Griffin,
who has settled in Australia, is interested in
a company that handles a new building
material, and he has plenty of work in sight
to keep him here.
Maoriland has just lost the foremost of its
native-born bankers, Percy Cox, who spent
his working life in the service of the ’Asia
and retired a couple of years ago, at 60,
from the job of chief inspector in M.L. He
was a grandson of Bishop Harper and a
pillar of the C. of E. At 25 he held the
half-mile running championship of Fernland,
and he was a provincial rep. Rugby foot-
baller. He got his first branch —Ashburton
—about that time, and the bank left him
there for 20 years, until the branch, and Cox,
grew so important that his path to a city
managership was clear. With Poison of the
Farmers’ Union and Esson of the Treasury
lie toured the world a year ago, inquiring
into rural credit schemes for the Government.
Admiral Harper, the Jutland historian, was
a first cousin.
“Hamer”: Steve O’Brien, whose restless
life has ended, was a fountain of ideas that
spouted for the benefit of others. A sign-
writer and decorator by trade, he had always
a strong leaning towards the Inky Way.
Under the name of “Jack Shay” he showed
himself a clever writer, but he preferred to
set others writing. Henry Lawson owed him
the germs of many verses. Steve went into
politics enthusiastically on the Labor side
and was rewarded with a hopeless nomina-
tion for Mosman against Dr. Arthur. Then
he took up poultry-farming, grew a remark-
able beard, refused to look at a paper, and
said he had done with politics. Last time I
saw T him the little man with the broad fore-
head knew he was under sentence of death,
but was as cheerful as ever.
“Knib”: Premier Hogan and Lands Min-
ister Bailey, who are representing Vic. at
the Federal-States finance conference in Syd-
ney, are two of the ablest of its 12 Labor
Ministers. Hogan’s circular tofellow-Ministers
to prune the estimates and lop off non-
essentials has given the Public Service the
surprise of its life. ll e will dare more
because he is a country member, than a town
Laborite would at the Treasury. Bailey has
already got a good grip of the Bands, the
most troublesome of the departments, 'with
its soldier-settlement problems. He will fight
strongly for the proposed special Common-
wealth sinking fund for loans for Diggers'
farms. Vic. is staggering under the burden
as things are; arrears of pavments by the
settlers total £5,000,000.
Cyril Barclay, Fitzroy’s “Father Barclay'’
of St. Mary’s Mission Church, is just back
after a year in the parish of St. Mary Mag-
dalene, Paddington, London. He wanted to
find out how bad slumland could be, and
has come back quite pleased with Fitzroy,
His mother was Florence Barclay, author
of “The Rosary” and other lending-librarv
favorites.
A man who headed off many attempted
suicides was the late A. C. Trice, for 20
years superintendent at the Reception House,
Darlinghurst, that term rounding off a ser-
vice of 42 years with N.S.W. Government
mental hospitals. The apostle of semi-nudity,
Chidlcy, was one of his salvages. Chidlcy
tride to choke himself by swallowing aii
orange whole, but Price acted promptly.
Price’s most startling experience was at a
public dinner, when a man - sitting on tjie
other side of the table rose and started to
throw crockery about, shouting “I’m sane,
and you’ve no right to keep me here!” lie
was an old Reception House client who, re-
cognising Price, jumped to the conclusion
hat he was back in the place that had
been his occasional home.
About the brightest young man in the
Maoriland Labor party is Dan Sullivan, who
holds the Avon scat, a Christchurch subur-
ban electorate, very securely. He was appren-
ticed to the French-polishing, but after climb-
ing high in Trades Hall circles as president
of the Furniture Trades Federation, lie be-
came an Inky Wayfarer. It was while he
was a Christchurch Sun reporter, eight years
ago, that Dan beat “Ricketty” Russell, vet-
eran journalist and ex-minister, for the Avon
seat. He is manager of the local party
machine, and under his shrewd guidance
the City Council was captured at last elec-
tion. Fellow-members like Sullivan, and lie’s
secretary of the Canterbury Parliamentary
Committee, a body made up of all parties
to protect the province against the domi-
nant North. He doesn’t wave a red flag,
and gets the votes of people who, in Seddon’s
day, would have reckoned themselves Lib-
erals.
When death called for John Frederick
Small, a branch of a tree planted by the
First Fleet was removed. Born in 1851 he
claimed John Small, a warder with the party
which laid the foundations of civilisation in
Australia, as his great-grandfather. Ilis
maternal grandmother was Mrs. Rebecca
Oakes, the first white person born in this
continent.
Labor has conceded one of the
plums to Dunstan,
leader of the Vic.
Country Progres-
sives ; he becomes a
member of the
Railway Standing
Committee, which
is worth an extra
£250 a year.
Chandler and Bell,
Ms.L.C., and Pen-
nington (Nat.).
Lind (Cocky) and
Pollard (Lab.) are
the other five mem-
bers. Digger Pol-
lard has got promo-
tion early, and men

ing passed over.

A thrifty soul was the old Kanaka. Good-
yen, who has passed out at Cambridge Downs
(N.Q.). He went into the district with the
first mob of sheep and stayed on. Not long
ago the inspector of the company that em-
ployed him said that the old chap’s faithful
service deserved a reward, and asked him to
say what he would like. Goodyen, after a
great deal of anxious thought, discovered that
his soul yearned most for a couple of 2in.
nails. Once the manager gave him a florin ;
they were going into town together. Goodyen
stuck to his wealth till they arrived and then
returned it, saying, “You stick to him, boss;
station might go broke.”
HIS RULING PASSION.

respectful allusions to vitamines. Some Sydney
doctors reverence them. Dr. Arthur, M.L.A., always
lowers his voice when speaking of them.” — Argus.
’Tis meet that with adoring awe
A chap should touch on sacred things,
Like creed and motherland and law,
And, if it please you, nueens and kings,
And love and death and wedding-rings,
And flags on poles and saints in shrines;
But there’s a hush that almost clings
When Arthur talks of vitamines.
The knight who sought but never saw
The grail whereof a laureate sings
Referred to It with muffled jaw.
The race-fan Carbine’s record slings
In deferential murmurings.
The actor mouths immortal lines,
But no such fervor in them flings
As Arthur keeps for vitamines.
What passionate emotions claw
The artist soul his gaze who swings
On Milo’s Venus sans a flaw,
Or old Velasquez’ colorings!
How tense, when Heifetz smites the strings,
The stillness that the house entwines!
Absorption just as rapt it brings
AVhen Arthur tells of vitamines.
Envoy.
Each to his gods brings offerings
And reverently his head inclines,
But there’s an earnestness that wrings
When Arthur speaks of vitamines.

To some people the apprecia-
tion of what is fine and good
is instinctive—they are the
true connoisseurs.
To them the appeal of a Chry-
sler is literally irresistible. Not
alone because of its flashing
performance; its sheer beauty;
its artistry of colour or its ob-
vious luxuriousness—but be-
cause it emanates that true
feeling of lasting quality.

NOW, OFF TO BED!
“Dad, if I ask a question you won't get wild and say ‘Off to bed!' will you?”
“Of course not, old man! Fire away!”
“Well, where does a snake begin when it wags its tad?”
“Larrapinta”: That par about the shift-
ing of 9000 head of cattle from Brunette
Downs (N.T.) to S. Queensland (B.
2/6/’27) brought to memory the morning of
January 19, 1887, when the late Jim Hut-
ton, of Raspberry Creek, Rockhampton, and
seven drovers left Brunette Downs with 1500
head of McDonnell, Smith and ,Co.’s cattle
(“505” brand). These were the first cattle
to be taken from the Barkly Tableland after
the country was stocked. Our route was
from Brunette to the Playford River, thence
to the Rankine, across the Queensland bor-
der at Austral Downs, where we swam our
cattle across the flooded Georgina. Thence
we followed the W. Queensland river system.
All the country was flooded, forcing us to
keep to the stony ridges. The feed was
knee-deep. Passing Boulia and Winton, after
28 weeks on the trip, we were heartily glad
to turn our cattle into paddocks at our
destination —Albilbah, near Isisford, on the
Barcoo. It was such a splendid season that
ottr cattle, which had been only in store con-
dition at the start, were rolling fat, and 800
of them were straightaway drafted out and
sent to Ilomebush, where they topped the
market. Some went as far as Tasmania.
Of the seven drovers, I was the only one
who saw the job through. Jim Hutton, one
of the finest men and best drovers in Queens-
land, gave me a reference which thereafter
got me a job whenever I showed it.
;jc H* &
“C. Coral” : The black armlet referred to
by “Ivelby” (B. 5/5/’27) as being worn by
Malays to ward off rheumatism is probably
made from the so-called “sea-tree,” which
flourishes in Torres Strait in great sub-
marine forests and is one of the perils
dreaded by divers. As thick round as a
man’s body in some cases, its branches wind
in sinuous spirals, and if a life-line becomes
entangled therein it is the. end of the diver.
One old hand, describing it, said: "That
tree is just like a fighting man. When it
feels you coming close and you put out
your hand to break it, it stiffens up. You
can do nothing with it unless by rushing at
it suddenly.” Over behind Oocoanut Island,
a Jap. diver joined his ancestors some few
years ago through getting down amongst
the stuff. When chopped or sawn off and
brought up, it takes on a black, shiny ap-
pearance like ebony, and is very hard, though
brittle. The islanders fashion it into rings
and wristlets to safeguard them against
drowning.
* * * *
“Saylin”: It may be correct that wild
ducks are not found in Papua (B. 2ff/0/’27),
but my experience in the Mandated Territory
is to the contrary. When we were camped
at the village of Margen, about 60 miles up
the Sepik River, in November last year, two
of our party crossed the river—about a mile
wide —and entered a large lake, where they
had excellent sport, bagging 20 brace in
two hours. The ducks were feeding on water-
lily seeds and were present in thousands.
About 280 miles farther up the river they
were also plentiful on the extensive swamps
in the wet season. The Sepik River is one
of the most mosquito-infested areas in the
world, anopheles predominating. This does
not suggest that the “aquatic families” are
infected with malaria, as suggested by
“B.J.’s” medical authority.
“Bihai”: If “8.J.” wants some fairly
decent duck-shooting in Papua, I suggest
he tries Vaigana swamp, the Hisiu lagoon
or the gigantic Inapi swamp, which stretches
from Mekeo to the Gulf division behind the
Topo oilfield. He will find in any of these
places not only ducks but plenty of other
water-fowl. Also he will find mosquitoes in
such myriads that he will probably disbelieve
the malaria theory advanced. My own the-
ory accounting for the comparative scarcity
of ducks is that alligators get more than
their fair share of them.
“Roback" : “Borom " (B. 17/2/J27) was off
the track in saying that the natives of man-
dated New Guinea know no vegetable poisons
and that their spears are generally made
from fishbone or fine splinters of hardwood.
(Our district is re-
mote from civilisa-
tion ; hence this' be-
latedness.) In the
Aitapc country
Brown Brudder has
a potent root called
“feu” which takes
one hour to help a
love-sick swain to
the realms of his
tabunas. Around
Kavieng in New
Ineland the jilted
one uses another
root (“bun”),
which, taken with-
out liquid, brings
death in thr e e
hours; with a
chaser and a dance
the suspense is re-
duced by a third.
One meets fishbone
spears only in the
villages along the
coast, and never in
the big bush ; there
warriors use a two-
foot length of bam-
boo extended to a
needle point. Weil
thrown, it pene-
trates the body,
causing a semi-cir-
cular wound that is
very slow to heal.
Other tribes use about a foot of casso-
wary shinbone carved on the same principle.
“Sebrof”: Stringybark can be put to vari-
ous uses, clothing among them. A rabbiter’s
three young children near Pooncarie
(N.S.W.) had suits made of the bark. It
had been softened by a good hammering, cut
out with a skinning knife, and sewn together
with packthread.
“E.S.S.": The price of jackeroos has gone
up. It was stated in evidence before the
Arbitration Court recently that these pas-
toral apprentices were necessary, as other-
wise qualified station managers would be
hard to get; and that they were paid
£1 a week, with periodic rises if
they were worth it. I remember
when many a jackeroo was paid less
than nothing. He was presented,
with a premium, to some squatter,
who was expected to give him
“colonial” experience, ’Chough he had
to work and rough it like other sta-
tion hands, he was privileged to live
with the boss’s family or had private
quarters. Many of the fraternity
made good, but more were
rank failures. Hugh Nelson,
afterwards Queensland Pre-
mier, commenced as a jack-
eroo on Eton Yale. Arthur
Campbell Mackworth I’racd
was jaekerooing at Spring-
sure when he met his wife,
a daughter of Murray-Prior,
of Logan River fame. He
didn’t stick to pastoral pur-
suits, but prospered as a
brewer, though mainly re-
membered as the husband of
Mrs. Campbell Praed. An-
other notable jackeroo was
“Lord” Wood, who had a
string band to escort him
to his homestead when set-
ting out on his own hook.
He was the most picturesque
failure in jackeroo history.
In a brief time he went
through a fortune of £BO,OOO,
*'** *■ - O " 7 -
and got down to wharf-lumping at a Queens-
land port. His wild career was ended by a
horse throwing him on the Nebo-road, near
Mackay.

“Wang”: “Speakin’ of alligators,” said
Larry the Liar, “me an’ me mate, Ned
Bowen, was in Brady's pub one night w’en
in comes a bloke in a devil of a state. He
belonged to the circus, he told us, after
gulpin’ down a drink, an’ a pet alligator ’ad
escaped. ‘lt ain’t dang’rous,’ he explained,
l ’avin’ r ad all its teeth took out, an’ it’s worth
a coupler ’undred quid, an’ they’s a reward
of a tenner to anyone as finds it.’ Ned an’
me has a couppla more drinks an’ then starts
home to our camp, ’bout three miles orf in
th’ scrub. ’ It’s a dark night an’ we mooches
along carefully, talkin’ ’bout th’ alligator an’
wishin’ it was daylight. After a while we
comes to a cocky’s place w’ere 'e’s been
strippin’ some ironbark trees. Th’ trunks is
standin’ white like ghosts. They’s a scatter
among the trees, an’ we gets scared : but it's
on’y pigs runnin’ loose in the paddick. I
sits on a log t’ light me pipe : then I jumps
up with a yell, fer th’ log moves under me
an’ crawls along a few feet an’ then stops.
Ned falls over tlv top of it. an’ gets up
yellin' 'lt's th’ alligator. Wot about that ten
quid reward?’ Some of th’ pigs comes nosin’
back, an’ tli’ alligator, makin’ funny noises,
crawls slowly towards them. That gives 11s
some courage, as he ain’t likely t’ tackle us
ANYTHING TO SUIT THE LADY.
“How far you come to-day, Jacky?
“’Bout twenty mile, Missie.”
“ That’s a long way, Jacky—l don’t think it could be that much.’ -
"Prap not so far, Missie. Prap only about twenty-five mile.”
while th’ porkers is .about. All through th
uiglit we watches an’ toilers him. cold an
shiverin’, but w’en daylight comes we gets a
shock. There ain’t a sign of the alligator
about: on’y th’ pigs nosin’ around an’ a roll
of ironbark lyin’ w’ere we reckoned we’d last
seen th’ alligator. We’re puzzlin’ wot t’
make of it, w’en we sees th’ roll of ironbark
move. Ned chucks a stick at it an’ it moves
on. Then we rushes it. Blest if it ain’t a
fat pig wot’s got ’imself jambed in under it,
with just room ter ’is legs to move. Th’
dinkum alligator was found all right, an' th’
bloke got th’ reward. We was dead unlucky.
W’en we got t’ th’ pub that night th’ blokes
was all tight an’ they was nothin’ left o’ th’
reward.”

“Johanna”: Kangaroos and the like do
not drink salt water (B. 30/6/’2T). They
have an uncanny knowledge of where to
dig for the fresh article. Bushmen
will follow the beaten tracks of
a ’roo round the banks of a saltwater lagoon
and be certain of striking the place to bore
for fresh water, if such exists. On the
heavily-timbered banks of the Mallacoota
Inlet (Vic.) there are great numbers of the
hoppers, and in the wildest parts round
the great inlet one may find, narrow paths,
beaten by them, that are as distinct as sheep-
tracks. Follow them and the thirsty may
be sure of fresh water.for the digging.
* * *
“Werriinee”: Black Brother’s temporary
night camp is sometimes a curious sight. I
happened upon a group at supper round a
fire that had burnt down to mostly red
coals, and on which part of the banquet
was still cooking. It was a cold evening,
and, to keep everybody comfortably warm
all round, a small fire was made at the back
of each person, forming a wide fiery ring.
Inside this, when the meal and smoke and
sing-song were over, most of them also made
their beds, the central lire being cleared
away. Binghi held that with one fire even
a dog had to keep turning round, as he got
half roasted on one side while the other
side was half frozen.
* * *
“Crojacko”: Life on the mission-stations
in the Gulf of Carpentaria is not bad for
those who like the wilderness. On the Mit-
chell and Embley Rivers, where two mis-
sions are established, the blacks never see
degenerate types of whites, those they meet
being the managers and overseers of cattle-
stations where the abos. work from time to
time. They are taught to build weather-
board huts and grow fruits and vegetables.
These, with beef grown on the reserves, where
the missions run thousands of head of cattle,
make a good diet and the physique of Black
Brother improves accordingly. The serpent
in this Eden is the Asiatic who comes down
the Gulf in his lugger for a dusky Eve.
(Continued on page 27.)
THE GREY TEAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sailor cleaves the sad sea, the axeman
cuts the glad tree,
The miner drills the sulphide in the lode s
seamed face,
While I must hold the grey team across the
slopes of Day Dream
Along the endless furrow at a three-mile
pace.
But thrushes on the roofs call and steadily
the hoofs fall
From horses in the draw-chains, and
coupled eight abreast;
And while the plough is riding across the
mould and herbage
A gracious sun is beaming from a lulls
bald crest.
A mile beyond the bright home I'm folding
off the light loam,
Or stirring up the black soil on swells
of stubborn clay,
With Noble on the near-side and Grafter on
thi- off-rein
And Hilda in the furrow through the
bright, brief day.
Across the fields of Day Dream the sunny
shafts at play beam
And mellow while the magpies proclaim
the coming spring,
And far a-main the bare slope is purged
anew with rare hope
While joyous morning voices in the robed
hills ring.
So let me drive a plain track with pipe alight
and rein slack
While shares are cutting under and the
hard boards fold.
The horses.know their task well, and cares
that once beset me
Arc turned beneath and hidden in the
sweet, wet mould.

“Spadger”: “We wos bringin’ in a mob of
cattle from Come-by-Chance,” said Ole Dan,
“an’ we killed one one night and threw the
’eart to Scruncher. ’E ’adn’t ’ad a. good feed
for a day or two, an’ ’e wos a big dorg, but
instid o’ snappin’ up the ’eart ’e looked at
it with ’is ’ead on one side; then ’e walked
all roun’ it, lookin’ suspicious-like all the
time. Then ’e started barkin’. ’E put ’is
’ead down between ’is front feet an’ made a
terrible row. Jus’ then up drives a city
bloke. ‘Goo’ day,’ I says. ‘Goo’ day,’ says
’e. ‘Wot’s bit y’r dorg?’ ‘Nothin’s bit ’im
yet,’ I says, ‘but there’s somethin’ in that
YES, THE DIRTY DOG!
COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT : “Could the motorist have avoided
you?”
PLAINTIFF : “Too right, he could! ’E ’ad th’ choice of me an
th’ missus, an’ he picked me.”
’cart might bite ’im, ’e thinks.’ The cove
asts a lot o’ questions, an’ then ’e says: ‘l’m
a Govinmint analyst, an’ I’ll analyse that
’eart for yer.’ So ’e did; an’ ’o found it
crawlin’ with anthrax germs. If it ’adn’t
bin for Scruncher we’d ’a’ all bin dead be the
next evenin’.” “What happened to Scrun-
cher?” I asked. “Oh, the analyst bloke took
’im down to Sydney,” Dan replied, “an’ ’e
used ter test all the pure foods by ’im. If
Scruncher barked at ’em ’e knew they w r asn’t

“(’oola”: Has any member of the Abo.
< ’ouncil noticed that our N.S.W. timber
develops more on its northern than on its
southern side? The sun shines all day on
the northern side of trees. As they grow
that side develops more, or larger, limbs. No
sunlight falls on the south side. Perhaps
prehardists can bear out this statement.
Also, cold winds blow from the south chiefly,
and snow and hail come from that direction.
Between the lack of warmth and the excess
cold on one side our trees become lop-sided.

“Biro”: While filling the tucker-bags of
a travelling Chinaman recently I was re-
minded that yellow swaggies
are more independent than their
white brethren; they will usu-
ally tender money for food suit-
plied. This one was penniless,
but when leaving he took a
light axe from his bundle and
laid it across the gateway. I
knew that the sign meant “I
wish you good luck!” I had
hard work to make him keep
the little axe.
“Kunika Tau”: At certain
times k)f the year whitebait
is caught by the natives in
large quantities at the mouth of
the Frisco River, New Guinea.
I have seen as much as half a.
ton of the delicacy hawked
round for sale in Salamoa, the
port for the Bulolo goldfield. The Fran-
cesco or Frisco River flows into the Huon
Gulf alongside the settlement.

“The Jumper” : I swung an axe for years;
but I always used a handle with the knob
untouched, save for the trimming away of
the tip of the sharp long heel. It is only
in the “falling” axe that the knob is a nuis-
ance at times; but for downward chopping
it is a decided advantage. Anyway, I always
found it so,, as did all my mates, and we
were some axemen.

“Bulantum” : Instances of the determination
of the Australian prospector are found on the
Bulolo field (N.G.). One party of five came
all the way from Australia in a little launch.
Another group of
three men rowed
from Samarai to
Salamoa in a
dinghy. And a man
walked overland,
carrying his swag,
from Port Moresby
to Salamoa.

“Phil P.”: West,
in his “History of
Tasmania,” states
that domestic bees
were first brought
to Van Diemen’s
Land from England
by Dr. T. B. Wil-
son, R.N., in 1834;
and, the conditions
suiting them, they
became distributed
all over the Speck,
and were sent to
the mainland. All
bees in Australia
appear to have been
derived from this
one source. Bees in
a wild state are to
be found in the
most remote locali-
ties of the Speck.
On the West Coast
they had estab-
lished themselves,
to my personal
knowledge, nearly
40 years ago. On
Bruny Island I
once found a colony
in a penguin’s bur-
row in a sand
dune; another was
in a burnt-out cav-
ity in a log on the
ground. I have seen
colonies in euca-
lypts, Huon pines
and myrtles—wher-
ever, in fact, a con-
venient hollow
could be found.
“Coot" : Victoria has two substances com-
monly known as manna (“Eureka,” B.
23/(5/’27). One is the dried sweet sap of
certain eucalypts which, when the leaves
and twigs are bruised or are punctured by-
insects, exudes, coagulates and falls to the
ground in snow-white particles, much loved
by youngsters and of old by abos. The
second kind is found chiefly in the Mallee.
Its native name is “lerp” or “laap.” It
is similar in shape and taste to the first,
but is secreted by the pupa of an insect
known as Psylla eucalypti on the leaves of
the mallee scrub. The blacks used to col-
lect it and decoct a sweet drink of which
they were fond.
“Bill R.”: Old buf erroneous is the theory
that the sweet exudation of the Monaro
(N.S.W.) ribbony-gum is the excreta of
locusts. Every summer locusts in myriads
appear in Monaro country, but it is only
after a rainy season that the trees shed their
manna. In favorable seasons a creamy juice
oozes from tiny splits in the bark and tw’igs
of the tree and, crystallised by the sun’s heat,
NO CONSIDERATION, THESE WIVES.
MISSUS: “Ain’t yer goin’ to work to-day?”
HUSBAND: “Struth! Did you wake up a bloke just to ask him that?”
falls to the ground in lumps that are, some-
times, far larger in size than any locust.
“Iluffin Guffin”: When I was a boy, in
the late ’seventies, our family lived on Ful-
ham station, near Balmoral (Vic.). In the
December months one of our bush-walks was
to “the manna trees,” locally known as box-
gums. There we could gather a teacupful
of manna in a few minutes, either from
the ground or the leaves of the trees. When
we tired of eating it we dissolved it in
water, making a sickly-sweet drink.

“R. J.J.T.” : Many years ago a Westralian
Government constituted Wyndliam a place
where executions of natives under sentence
of death might be carried out. A day was
appointed for a batch of such executions and
the news widely circulated among the natives.
It was thought that hangings in the presence
of the natives would be a deterrent from
future crime. On the appointed day a great
crowd assembled, and, amid laughter and
jabbering, the condemned savages were duly
scragged. They did not appear to be at all
concerned at their fate and were laughing
up to their last moments. When they had
all been disposed of the native spectators
brought other men to be hanged. With
laughter and - gesticulation they made it
understood that they wanted more sight-
seeing. Even the men proposed to be done
to death looked on the matter as a joke.
After that no more executions were carried
out at Wyndham. It was found that the
worst punishment an abo. could be con-
demned to was exile from his district.

“Pick” : When N.S.W. coastal lakes, closed
by sandbars across their mouths, fill to
their rims, spat-oysters spread on the sub-
merged rocks to the high-water mark. They
are left there high and dry when the lake
eventually bursts out to sea, and then comes
the harvest time of the adjacent oyster
leaseholder. lie gathers the stranded bivalves
and transfers them to his leases, there to
fatten and grow into money. I c-nce saw
a bullock-waggon full of oysters being shifted
from Wallaga Lake, on the South Coast, to
the foreigners’ leases at Narooma, 11 miles
away. It took 18 hornies to haul the many
tons* of plate-oysters represented in that
heaped-up load.

“A.M.”: I was persuaded by a Chinese
merchant at Innisfail (N.Q.) into buying a
peculiar fruit. It looked like an outsize in
pineapples, was brown and green in color,
and had a covering of short, hard spikes. I
kept the fruit, as instructed, until it softened,
depositing it in my room. The following
morning I woke with heavy eyes and a thick
head. The room was filled with a heavy,
penetrating odor, the cause of which proved
to be my strange fruit. As it was now soft
I opened it, when the most awful stench
imaginable pervaded the house. I tasted
the inside of it, a rich yellow in color, hold-
ing my nose as I did so. The taste was very
pleasant, something like that of a rich cus-
tard apple, but it was days before I could
get rid of the putrid after-taste. The Chinese
called the fruit “bulldog custard apple,” but
was it?
“The Jumper” : A dodging marsupial or a
goanna can be brought round from the oppo-
site side of a tree by heaving a stone or a
block of wood so that it falls on the ground
behind the dodger. The native bear is an
adept at the hide-and-seek business, and
when the pelt-lifters are out an inexperi-
enced city-bred specimen often walks himself
half-silly running rings round a tree trying
to get a dodging grunter into view. But the
stupidest soon learn that a carefully-timed
stone dung in the right direction produces
the desired effect, and poor Stumpy has
collected a bullet or a charge of shot before
he discovers he has been tricked.
* x * *
“Bulantum” : It is a quite common custom
for natives in various parts of New Guinea
to carry on them some bone of a deceased
relative (B. 16/5/’27). A widow of Atzra,
in the Markham Valley, wears the skull of
her departed husband, suspended from her
neck; she has a notion that by constantly
stroking the skull she will placate his spirit.
Many of the skulls which have been thus
worn for some years are quite polished by
continual stroking.
x * * ■ *
“Hayeworray”: For 15 consecutive years
a small township on the Victorian side of
the Murray has been invaded regularly by
a great number of swallows, which congre-
gate in the post-office verandahs chiefly. In
mild winters they have stayed for quite eight
months. This year only one “married couple”
came to the old haunts, and they disappeared
after one night. Where is it these birds go?
Some say to Japan, others say to Siberia.
Hatters declare that their absence is a sure
tip of a drought.
;i: * '-l> *
“Tokainabul”: In New Guinea the Sepik
River natives are star artists at tribal and
decorative mutilation. A favorite design is
an elaborate scroll of heavy scarring round
each nipple. The shoulders are _ frequently
decorated with a primitive scar-picture of a
human face, and sometimes the back, from
shoulders to hips, is almost completely cov-
ered with raised oblique lines and dots. When
being cut about for personal adornment the
native suffers the operation with stoical com-
posure.
* x * *
“Bark”: In spite of “Bargona’s” statement
(B. 26/5/’27). I will undertake to charm
any carpet or brown snake into an amiable
frame of mind by whistling to him. I can’t
claim to have had much luck with black
snakes, but I have often had a carpet-snake
swaying to the “Merry Widow” waltz. At
Muldu (Q.) I once tipped a brown snake
out of my bread-tin. lie took up a possic
over the door, which was the only exit from
the hut. On it hung a stockwhip, my sole
offensive weapon. I tried the gentler way,
and after about five minutes of “The Blue
Danube” was able to lift my whip from
within a foot of the wriggler and send him
out to the “Dead March.”

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
BLACKBERRIES.
“J.F.T.”: After much experimenting the
writer, who had studied the ways of goats
in S’Africa during the Boer War, decided
to try the animals on his Australian black-
berry plantation. Observing what browsers
they are, thriving on thorny ""d harsh
shrubs, lie managed on his retin. this
country to get together a herd of about 100,
some of them pure Angoras, others common
white nannies. They were paddocked off
in an area of about 20 acres, where the
blackberries were thickest, the paddock being
wire-netted, with two top plain wires. In
the same paddock there were many sw’eet-
briar bushes. Goats are very fond of and
thrive upon blackberry and briar leaves,
especially the young shoots, and when put
to it they will eat every leaf as soon as it
appears. In six or nine months that pad-
dock was bare. Salt was liberally supplied,
and every few days the goats were let out
for a browse and change, under an old
herdsman, who put them back in their pad-
dock at night. Meanwhile a second paddock
was netted off and the goats transferred to
it, being taken back to the original paddock
if any surreptitious blackberry leaves ap-
peared. After a course of this treatment
no leaves appeared, and examination proved
that the plants had died out completely,
roots and all, both blackberry and briar,
and there has been no sign of re-growth
since, though 10 years have elapsed.
Next to goats, sheep are the best in this
kind of work, and in this country are more
profitable and less difficult to control. But
the time must come when the goat-breeding
industry, both of the Angora and Swiss and
Nubian milch breeds, will become established
in Australia, as is rapidly being done in the
U.S.A.
RECLAIMING SALT PATCHES.
A successful Westralian experiment in
the reclamation of salt land, the record of
which should be preserved in the Murray
and Murrumbidgee country, is reported in
the Westralian Journal of Agriculture,
by Director G. L. Sutton, formerly of N. S.
Wales. The land in question is portion
of a farm at York owned by A. J. Monger,
sometime president of the Primary Pro-
ducers’ Association; it is on the banks of a
watercourse, and, owing to the rise of salt
near the surface, became practically bare.
The Government Analyst found 1.22 S p.c.
of water-soluble salts present in a sample
of the soil- —“a highly calcareous, fine-tex-
tured grey marl” —.879 p.c. being common
salt. Soils which contain more than .25 p.c.
bf common salt are unsuitable for the growth
of farm plants.
The first step towards success was taken
when a heavy dressing of stable manure was
applied. Then sheep manure was spread
rather thickly over the salty land and culti-
vated well into the soil. Next, subterranean
clover was planted, with an application of
superphosphate at the rate of lewt. per
acre. It has been found that super, helps
to overcome moderate amounts of salt by
encouraging the growth of the root system,
so that moisture is drawn from a greater
depth. Stable manure assists in combat-
ing salts by increasing their absorption, by
improving the water-holding capacity of the
soil and by reducing the percentage of salt
in the surface layer of mixed soil and
manure. And owing to the calcareous nature
of the soil, the decomposition of the manure
proceeds rapidly, proving the physical con-
dition of the soil and facilitating the removal
of the salt by drainage.
OUR SHORTAGE OF PHOSPHATES.
“Burrum”: As “W.P.D.” points out (B.
9/6/’27), the shortage of phosphates In our
grazing lands has very serious results. Phos-
phate of lime is essential for bone growth
and the lack of it always results in second-
rate animals. The best-formed and biggest
animals come from limestone districts, e.g.,
the huge old Shire horses of the English
Midlands. Practically all Australian soils
are deficient in phosphate of lime —we have
no phosphate deposits of any consequence
in the continent, hence no soils formed from
them or rich in phosphate. This shortage
is reflected in the animals and crops grown
here; Prof. Osborne, of Melbourne Univer-
sity, remarked on the insufficiency of phos-
phates in the grain-foods of Australia, and
the bad teeth of the native-born may be
taken as a sign that lie is right. “W.P.D.”
says that top-dressing is practicable to a
limited extent, but that limit is far from
reached —hardly sot out for, in fact. Supply
by phosphate licks is only an evasion of the
duty of regular replacements of phosphates
to the soil directly.
MAIZE FOR SHEEP.
“Saaedi”: The consensus of Bulletin
opinion seems to favor grain-oats _ as a
•drought fodder; but I believe maize is
superior for the feeding of sheep. It has
a high food value and is easily fed. The
1927 N.S.W. Graziers’ Conference favored
it as drought fodder, and carried a resolu-
tion advocating . the establishment of maize
silos at suitable places throughout the State.
What we need is a series of experiments
conducted in a scientific fashion to determine
this matter once and for all. Questions of
cost would of course complicate the considera-
tion. But a balanced formula could be
arrived at. Different feeding is required for
ewes in lamb and with lambs at foot than for
dry sheep, and this aspect of stock feeding
could be considered also and a separate
formula laid down. If there were recog-
nised food formulas for sheep in general
use, farmers would be likely to set them-
selves to produce the required materials,
being assured of a market. At present the
very important business of fodder conserva-
tion is left almost entirely to chance and
individual caprice.
LAMB-MARKING RECORDS—AND
OTHERS.
“Taharangi” : When “ J.D.C.” states in a
paper which is seen by nearly every over-
seer, boundary-rider and jackeroo in the land
that “the man who cannot mark 1000 lambs
an hour doesn’t know his job,” I venture
to suggest that he is more dangerous than
a dingo.
In this as in many other branches of Aus-
tralian industry, we are too apt to worship
at the shrine of speed when we should be
giving our tributes to craftsmanship. Let
a man make himself master of his job, and
the speed God gave him will soon come of
itself; for it is usually easier to work quickly
than slowly. Take shearing, for example.
There is nothing more fascinating to watch
tlian the apparently effortless ease with
which the expert catches his sheep, places it
and holds it, while the fleece rolls .off with
seemingly no more trouble to him than if he
were helping a girl out of her fur coat.
That man is nearly always a fast worker;
but he was a good shearer before he was a
fast one. However, Speed became the fetish,
records were published and bandied about
and the learner cared for nothing but his
tally. The natural result was that, as skill
may be acquired but speed is born in a man,
a wide difference was manifest between the
cheques of the fastest man and the slower
ones. Up went the rates of pay to rectify
this, until they came to a point where the
fast man didn’t see wdiy he should hurry
himself for a few quid extra, and the slow
man could get along quite comfortably with-
out having to learn his job thoroughly. So
now we pay a lot more to get our sheep
shorn a lot worse; and, worst of all, we’ve
practically lost the former type of Austra-
lian shearer, a man no other nation could
equal, the finest, cleverest craftsman God
and a continent ever evolved.
No more records —please !
UNIFORM WOOL PRODUCTION.
_ “R. E. Combing”: Owing to coal-strikes,
high comparative costs of production and
such like. disadvantages, the Yorkshire wool
trade has had a bad period of depression.
The feature of its trading which stood to it
most was the very faithful standardisation
of its commodities. The G4’s tops of one
manufacturing house may not be exactly the
same as that of another, nor a given yarn
precisely the same in every particular, but
purchasers can rely on the class of goods
listed by any one firm being always the
same from year to year. This means that
the purchaser of any commodity that is
found to be suitable to him can always book
a repeat order in confidence that it will be
quite up to the specification of that already
delivered.
In the production of the raw material, it
is obviously impossible for growers to main-
tain a uniform standard from year to year,
nor yet a very complete uniformity in any
one year: conditions of the season vary, and
sheep grow different types of wool on
different parts of the body. But seeing the
procession of clips offered for sale from year
to year, one can’t help thinking that, a great
many of our growers might maintain more
uniformity than they do. So many men,
rather than breed their own sheep, prefer
to buy their stock as they want it, which
would be all very well if they invariably
bought the same class of stuff, or kept their
flocks of the same style throughout. But
a lot of them buy what seems to them to be
cheap at the time, and often have all sorts
of breeds on the place at the same moment,
yielding wools of very different character,
Then, again, many who do breed their own
stuff will not stick to the same class of rams.
Of course, they may need a .change occasion-
ally in order to correct some faults that
creep in, but the switching' about that some
men practise makes more faults than can
ever be corrected. With the number of sheep
that there are in N. S. Wales at present,
there is no excuse for any man to have a
patchwork flock. They would find that a
considerable advantage comes to them if
they altered their tactics. Confidence in
buying is a great asset —particularly to the
seller.
CONDITIONS MAKE THE WOOL.
“Trepex” : “W.I’.D.” is on sound ground
when he says that the quality or fineness of
wool is largely determined by feed condi-
tions and climate, (B. 23/6/’27). The nature
of the growing season plays a big part. In
drought times wool tends to fineness and
thinness; in good seasons the reverse is the
case. Likewise, of course, the length and
soundness are greatly affected. That is why
wool consumers are always so interested
in the kind of season we are having and the
extent of our rainfall. In Yorkshire papers
(trade journals and others) one will always
find a corner devoted to a tabulated state-
ment of Australian rainfalls. The season
reacts on both the quantity and the quality,
and the wily man from Bradford wants
some idea of what is coming. At this time
of the year he is full of inquiry as to what
the new season’s clip is going to be like.
One could make a safe bet that some con-
siderable number of pounds was spent in
cables foreshadowing the nature of our
next clip as indicated by the few autumn-
shorn clips that were offered in the June
series of sales.
SIIEEP ANCESTRY.
“Borer”: Of all the splendid stud flocks
of sheep in Australia, there are only two
which can trace direct descent from the
original merino sheep brought to this coun-
try from S’Afriea by Captain Waterhouse
and absorbed by a very few of our more
enterprising pioneers. These are the Mum-
blebone and Egelabra flocks, which were
founded on purchases made from John Smith,
of Gamboola, Molong. John Smith, after ho
bought the place with its cheep, very con
siderably improved the stud, whose founda-
tion had been laid in 1840 by W. Betts on
the flocks established by his father-in-law,
the Rev. Samuel Marsden, from direct im-
portations from Spain as well as the origi-
nal few from Cape Colony.
This history does not deny credit for the
establishment of the wool-growing industry
to John Macartliur. He led, closely followed
by the long-headed parson, who also, as far
back as the seventeen-nineties, saw that a
big frame and a robust constitution were as
essential as the wool.
LAMP,-MARKING.
“G.S.M.”: Now that lamb-marking is here,
every operator should realise that the steril-
isation of all instruments cannot be over-
done. Another good point is to give the
lambs plenty time to mother up; hold the
mob until they are mothered up. In some
cases it may be necessary to put the mob
together next day if they do not mother well
when let out of the yards. Also all tails
should be burnt, and while there is no danger
of fires all carcases in the paddocks should
be burnt also. If all station men did this the
fly trouble would soon be negligible.
“Collaroy” : I hate to think “N.M.L.” (B.
23/6/’27) mishandles the truth, but marking
3000 lambs in three hours is stretching it too
far. It can’t be done. Perhaps tailing only,
but certainly he couldn’t have cut and tailed
that number in that time. Eight hundred an
hour is exceptionally fast, and I would like
to hear the names of any stations in N. S.
Wales that mark 8000 a day even with two
or more cutters. Re the mortality of 300 in
27,000 lambs marked, how did “N.M.L.”
count? From the marking to the shearing
count or just what were actually found dead
in the paddocks after marking? If the
former it is wonderfully light; if the latter,
the figures are quite valueless.
CATTLE AND lODINE.
“Woolongoon” : A leading Yic. breeder of
cattle has been experimenting with iodine
for his pregnant cattle. He concludes that
potassium iodide should be fed carefully and
regularly, as it increases the supply of iodine
in the thyroids of the mother and offspring,
and lias a stimulating effect on the whole
system.
If your cows take a lot of salt, mix 4oz.
of pot. iodide in a cup of warm water and
sprinkle the solution over 1001 b. of salt,
which should first be spread out on a clean
floor. Vary the amount in relation to the
size of the herd, of course, but keep the same
proportions. If a cow takes very little salt,
a quarter-teaspoonful of powdered pot. iodide
could be given her once a week in the feed.
The method is used in Canada by breeders
of pedigree cattle, and in studs over there
are some of the finest representatives of their
class I have seen.
THE NETTED FENCE.
“Dogosh”: The Vic. Government is sup-
plying wire-netting to settlers on long, easy
terms and many miles of fencing are being
erected. A ’ few hints may therefore prove
of assistance.
The trench should be ploughed to the
required depth with one horse in a single-
furrow. Use a very small spreader-bar in
the leading harness, so that the horse can
work close to the posts. Holes for the wires
at the top and centre of the netting should
be bored as close to the edge of the post
as possible. Roll the netting out from right
to left, and affix straining apparatus. This
should . consist of two pieces of timber
clamped together on each side of the netting
with three bolts. From this, two wires or
small pieces of chain to form a V are secured
to any make of wire-strainer and strained
to the base of a post further on. Before
taking the strain, the netting should be
caught up to the top wire in four or five
places with easy-running wire hooks. Secure
the netting at the top with tie-wire or clips
before filling the trench. At each post press
the netting down with a blunt-nosed shovel
and cover with sufficient earth to hold firm,
completing the filling-in of trench on return.
FARM RECORDS.
“Tarago” : Is this anything like one? Mar-
tin Iteidy, of the Kooweerup Swamp (Vic.),
harvested 22 bags to the acre from a crop of
barley this season. This tally does not in-
clude “seconds.”
ROUr IN POULTRY.
“Bobette”: “E.li.” (B. 23/6/ ! 27) _ de-
scribes roup as the poultry-farmers’ winter
nightmare; but most of the severe outbreaks
would be avoided if farmers would get out
of the habit of overcrowding their fowls.
Each bird should be allowed seven inches
perching room and all sheds, even high open-
fronted ones, should have a space of four
inches at the back, between the top of the
wall and the roof, for ventilation. Keep the
floors clean and dry, and promptly isolate
any occasional case you may find. Then
you are not likely to have an outbreak.
The cheesy substance sometimes found in
the throat is canker, much less deadly and
less contagious than roup. A fowl may be
suffering from canker with apparently very
little ill-effect on its general health, but a
loud whistling or choking sound is evidence
that the matter is accumulating round the
windpipe. It should be carefully removed
with a piece of fine, bent wire, (the almost-
obsolete hairpin used to be handy for this),
and the throat afterwards painted with
iCondy’s. The symptoms of roup are an
evil-smelling discharge from the eyes and
nostrils, and the accumulation of the cheesy
substance in the eyes. This must be re-
moved by syringing with strong Condys,
kerosene, or boracic and salt (a teaspoontul
of boracic and half a teaspoonful of salt
to half a pint water). In bad cases it is
better to destroy the bird immediately, but
should it be fairly vigorous and have one
eye only affected, treatment can be perse-
vered with. In damp weather a few drops
of kerosene, just enough to. form a lighi
film over the drinking-water, is an insurance
against colds, and a regular supply of green-
stuff helps to keep them fit.
PIGS AND PROFITS.
“Spike”: Although only a comparative
newcomer in the game, for the past two
years my three Berkshire sows have each
netted £5O per annum. And this despite
the fact that I have neither slum-milk,
butter-milk, nor swill to give them.
I have about three acres of land which
I soav heavily with maize. To each sow
carrying pigs I give two cobs and a trough
of water morning and evening. They re
poor, but it pays to keep them in low condi-
tion, as a fat sow gets lazy and will lay
on her litter. As the crop commences to
cob, I cut out the suckers and stunted stalks;
the green cobs produce an abundant milk
supply, and, , later, the young pigs do admir-
ably on them. The main crop is merely
pulled and carted in; husking is unnecessary.
The pigs are then turned out into the
cultivation to pick up whatever cobs have
been missed or dropped. Should the market
be adverse, I have sufficient corn always to
hold the stock till such time as a fair margin
of profit is assured. The best prices are
always obtained during the late_ autumn and

“Dennis” (B. 23/6/’27) says that the pig

portant abattoirs will speedily dispel the

not converted into a valuable product. Poor
returns from the pig are nearly always due
to the short-sighted policy of not growing and
conserving sufficient feed to carry stock over
adverse markets.
' BUD SELECTION.
“Poncirus” : “Penfield’s” remarks (B.
16/0/’27) on Pedigree Trees are opportune;
but it is next to impossible at the present
time to obtain trees worked from pedigree
trees, let alone demand them, unless the
selection is made by the grower himself. In
Australia we have only touched the fringe
of selection in propagating fruit-trees, and I
know of no Government movement or public
body here that propagates from selected
stone, pome or other fruit-trees. Certainly
something has been done on the Irrigation
Area with citrus, particularly Washington
Navel and Valencia oranges; also the N.S.W.
Agricultural Department called a conference
of interested bodies to deal with bud selec-
tion some months ago, but apparently that
is as far as the matter has gone.
Of all the operations in fruit culture, this
of bud selection is easily the most important.
Pedigree trees, which represent vigor, crop-
ping qualities, type and shape of fruit and
quality of flesh, are the first essentials to
better orchards and bigger profits. Selec-
tion of buds means more than taking buds
from a profitable orchard. It means deter-
mining the heaviest bearing trees in such a
plot of trees by taking records of the crop
of each individual tree over a term of years.
This is essential in propagating all fruit-
trees, but with citrus, if not with all others,
we must go even further. Citrus-trees have
a marked habit of “sporting,” or showing
“bud variations,” and it is often possible to
find several distinct types of fruit on the
same tree or two distinct types on the
same branch. So to make as sure as possible
tJiat the right type of fruit is being repro-
duced, buds must be selected from the twig
carrying the desired type of fruit, and from
as near as possible to such fruit.
Much work has been done in California
in this direction, and from records taken it
has been shown Jhat up to 32 per cent, of
citrus-trees have failed to produce a profit-
able crop. One instance given (Agricultural
Experimental Station, University of Cali-
fornia, Circular 266) is of 32 'p.c. of the
trees in one citrus orchard being unprofitable,
42 p.c. self-supporting and only 26 p.c. that
showed a profit. Another instance is of a
show citrus orchard returning a net profit
of 500 dollars per acre per year, yet with
such a high net return only 68 pc. of the
trees were profitable. The remaining 32 p.c.
was made up of 19 p.c. of trees .self-support-
ing and 13 p.c. absolutely unprofitable. With
these . authentic figures before us it is not
surprising that so many of our orchardists
fail to make even the basic wage.
The. Fruitgrowers’ Federation and the Co-
operative Packing House movement will fail
to lift the great majority of citrus growers
out of the rut unless improvement is made
in this all-important direction. Further,
the nurseryman should not be in this job.
The only part he should play is to put the
buds into the stocks and make good trees
from them. The locating of the most profit-
able trees and the selection of the buds is
purely a grower’s matter. Let him stick
to that job; and, having found such trees,
let him be prepared to pay liberally for
the privilege of taking the buds.
THE WAY TO GET TREES.
“Larrapinta”: In the eastern States of
Australia no attempt seems to be made to
Plant the beautiful, fast-vanishing red cedar
The reason generally given is that they won’t
grow because the twig-borer kills off the
young ones. Yet in Adelaide they use the
red cedar for street-planting, and in the
Botanic Gardens is a cedar 40 years old
with a trunk seven feet in girth and 20 feet
to the first branch.
On the gully land where I winter my
bees every year I have a small plantation
of cedars, all thriving, as well as dozens
of other trees, native or foreign, that are
of value.. Among them are American “shag-
bark” hickory—the tree from which the axe-
handles we import are manufactured—Cir-
cassian walnuts, kauri pines, Douglas
(Oregon) firs, and all the commercially-
va In able Aussie timbers except W.A. jarraii
my only failure. My little forest is doing
wonderfully well, the best growth being made
by the Queensland kauri pines, with the
hickory second. It has cost me a few
shillings in postage of seeds from abroad,
and a few hours of pleasant work raising
and planting out seedlings. It's no use
talking reafforestation schemes —that gets a
man nowhere. The only thing to do is to
go out with a shovel and plant a few trees
every winter. The expense is trifling, the
labor , not worth mentioning, and, although
a man may not live to sit down on a
cedar chair made from a tree lie planted,
the beauty of a small plantation of firs,
pines, or our own good Aussie trees is re-
ward enough for me.
THE MURRAY SETTLEMENTS.
. ‘‘ H 2 S, F : “Croesus” (B. 30/6/’27) is not
far off the mark in saying that the soil of
Sun ray si a, given water, will produce almost
anything. Passion-fruit has been grown in
Denmark and Mildura since the beginning
ot these settlements, and cotton from Mil-
dura took first prize in Brisbane well over
30 years ago. Rice, as grown at Leeton,
is economically impossible in the Sunraysia
settlements on account of the cost of water;
also we have not the type of land on which
rice is grown in the Murrumbidgee area.
But there is room for a great deal more
experiment with cotton and tobacco, both
m which have been tried within recent years.
Cotton was given a pretty fair test in the
South Australian areas a few years back,
but with not very encouraging results. Our
summer is too short to mature the crop
properly, so as to get it out of the way
in reasonable time. It would probably not
be very difficult to breed quicker maturing
varieties, but this is not a job for the
private grower and no one else in this
country has thought it worth while to take
it in hand. Similarly, it might be possible
to develop a strain of tobacco suitable to
these parts.
Just at present there is no special induce-
ment for growers to be considering other
crops than fruit, except fodder for their
live stock. Control in the dried fruits in-
dustry and the export bonus on sweet w T ines,
together with British preference, have vastly
improved matters since the disastrous slump
of 1924. Exported sultanas show r ed a quite
reasonable profit last year, and promise to
do so this year, though the size of the crop
will probably tax the capacity of the London
market for the high-class and relatively high-
priced fruit Australia sends it, and it is
very doubtful whether there is room for the
planting of more vines of this variety.
Currants should never have been planted so
heavily. Nevertheless, they paid in 1924.
when sultanas didn’t, and they did not fall
far short of paying last year. The Canadian
trade, which is just being developed under
the trade treaty, holds considerable pro-
mise for the currant, and in the South Aus-
tralian settlements, where there are co-
operative wineries and distilleries, currant
and gordo grapes are paying well for wine
and spirit purposes.
There is considerably more hope in a
wise diversity of fruit planting than in the
side-lines indicated by ’‘Croesus.” Orange-
growers with good land who have looked
after their trees have found them profitable,
and some of them highly profitable, and the
pear is paying well for canning. There
appears to be room for considerable further
planting of these trees, also of wine varieties
of vines. The apricot has paid all through
the slump years, as has the Smyrna fig, but
it is doubtful whether there is room for
any big planting of either of these fruits.
The British preference on our dried fruits
(£8 10s. a ton on raisins and £2 on currants),
which “Croesus” considers unhealthy, is
given merely by remitting the regular duty.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“.T4X”: “Anthony Gloster” says (B.
30/6/'27) there’s only one certain cure for
girth-galls. There are hundreds. But with a
horse that galls, it’s not a cure that’s needed
so much as a preventive. To turn a horse
out is a good idea, if he can be spared.
But first apply a liberal coating of axle-
grease to the gall; burnt grease from the
box of a wheel for preference. When the
horse is got in again always use a crupper.
And don’t be frightened of putting too much
neatsfoot, oil on the girth, surcingle and
flaps; it’s cheap, and I never heard of a
saddle rolling on a horse through too much
grease on it. The loose-girth idea is bun-
kum. Girth the horse tight, but not over-
tight.
“Gundy”: For “pink-eye” or ■cattle-
blight” in horses use kerosene —you can get
that and you can’t get most of the other
things recommended. Soak a rag in it, rest
it on the animal’s forehead just above the
eye and squeeze until the liquid runs down.
This won’t scare the most nervous horse. In
the early stages of the disease it will cure in
two days.
“ J.D.”: For greasy heel in horses, good
results . are obtainable from the use of
muttonbird-oil, which is cheap.
“J.G.”: Here are a pair of gate-hinges
which cost only a few minutes’ work. Get
a flat piece of wood about four or five
inches wide and about 1-Jin.’ thick. Bore a
ljin. or 2in. hole near one end of the wood,
which should be about 18in. long. This is
for the top hinge. Bore another hole of the
same size in a stout piece of log or wooden
block. Sink this in the ground at the
base of the gate-post; the top of the block
may be an inch or two above the surface.
The end of the gate should be made so that
there are two end-pieces projecting two or
three inches from the top and bottom of
the end of the gate. These projections should
be rounded off to fit in the holes in the
blocks of wood. Fit one end of the gate
into the hole in the sunken block, and fit
the other end-piece into the hole in the flat
piece of wood. Adjust the gate so that it
will revolve easily in the blocks of wood,
and nail the flat piece firmly on the top
of the gate-post, and the gate is hung. These
hinges are very suitable for gates made of
saplings.
“Anthony Gloster”: Watch your horse’s
joints in winter time. A cut or a knock on
knee or fetlock is, as a rule, insignificant in
summer, because green feed is conducive to
speedy recovery. The same slight injury
occurring when the animal is getting corn
or oats spreads readily to the joint, which
swells, and will break down if the animal
is worked. If the joint is swollen and hot
to the touch, keep it in running water for
In minutes twice a day till the heat goes
out of it. Rubbing upwards with Elliman's
after bathing with hot water is a help. Cut
out corn altogether and give him bran with
chaff if no green feed is available. Do not
work him at all; above all, do not shut
him up in a stable overnight, or you may
find him with a joint the size of a football-
in the morning.
“C.Y.R.”: “Hatter” (B. 23/G/'27). de-
scribing three ways of telling when a hen is
in laying condition, mentions feeling the
bird's abdomen as one. but adds that it is
troublesome on account of having to catch
the birds. I have never found it so. Take
a piece of strong fencing wire sft. long. At
one end a hook about Sin. long is made: on
the other a wooden handle is fixed. Walk
up behind the hen when she is walking away
and with a quick circular movement catch
her leg in the hook and pull her to you. I’ve
done a couple of hundred in an hour. The
abdomen test is the only sure one I know.
“Anthony Gloster”: Sheep and cattle dogs
in rabbit-infested country require dosing for
worms four times a year. A made-up powder
costs only a shilling, and means several
years’ extra life to Fido. It is nasty to the
taste, so is best administered by being con-
cealed in deep gashes in a piece of raw meat,
which is tossed carelessly to the dog after he
has been kept fasting at least 30 hours.

SWEETHEARTS LONG AGO.
When the long day has been dreary
And the salt seems gone from life ;
When the brain and bones are weary
Of the struggle and the strife,
Take a good cigar and light it,
Watch tlie red tobacco glow,
And turn your lazy memory
To the girls of long ago.
Look backward through the gloaming
To the golden days of youth ;
Let your thoughts go softly homing
To that summer-time with Ruth,
To the trysting ’neath the willows,
Where the waters scarcely flow,
And you listened for her footstep
In the evenings long ago.
Though the years keep onward marching
From the days long left behind;
When with all your feelings parching
You searched through the mail to find
Just a word and kiss from Laura:
“I’ll be there as usual. .Toe.”
You can read it in the smoke-rings
As you read it long ago.
As you dream your dreams, you ponder,
And you wonder where they are,
Those loved maidens in Time’s yonder—
Each in turn your guiding star.
Rut no matter where they linger
You are happier to know
That at times their thoughts go backward
To the loves-of long ago.

Is an object pitiful;
So do what my Matilda did
With lambs that lose their wool.
I gave my girl a willing colt,
The kindest ever foaled.
She swapped him for a spavined mule
Whose feet were shod with gold.
That mule got poor as wood —
She worked him while lie stood :
Then sold his shoes (and hide) and bought
The fastest car she could.
I gave my girl a book of songs •
I made for her alone:
She sold them to a publisher
And bought a gramophone.
For songs are thrilling when
They're written all for you :
But a jazz is “quite too killing”
When you’re “feeliiv kinda blue.”
I gave my girl a diamond ring.
It was a dream, she said.
Next week I also got a ring
To say that she was wed.
For a ring is “too divine”;
But a trinket, after all,
When stacked against an income fat
Is apt to ring in small.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
STANDING upright Ted wiped his fore-
head and cast his eyes over the belt
of scrub between him and the creek. Not
much more than saplings—he reckoned if
he bogged into it lie could touch the bank
of the creek by tea-time. It was knocking-
off time now, and no one could growl at
the day he’d put in. But —well, he'd always
been one for a bit extra.
Jack Bellamy, his mate, was a good
worker, fast and thorough; when he said
a patch was cleared, it was cleared ; but he
always smiled at Ted’s "bit extra.” “What’s
the sense in overdoin’ it, TeddoV A day's
a day, all said an’ done.”
Grubbing up the small stuff with his
mighty hands, Ted smiled, too; not everyone
could tackle the extra hit at the end of
the solid day a clearer put in. When he
was a kid milking, and that for old Hartigan,
he’d always reckoned to do better than the
rest of the crew ; and he reckoned to do it
now.
The hit extra done and the hank of the
cieek touched, he shouldered his axe and
strode through the cleared patch. It was
a good life. He was proud of himself;
proud of his six feet of bone and muscle;
proud of having cut through to the creek,
lie was ready for his tea, too, and a clean-
up for the walk into Grayson, with a yarn
and a pot or two before the walk back.
“Anything we want, Jack?” he asked, giv-
ing his boots a bit of a rub. “I’m goin’
down for the paper.”
“Yairs. You can bring some butter an’
bacon. Don’t get shickered.”
Jack’s weather-beaten eyes smiled vaguely
at him; he seemed to feel them following
him down the track and out on to the
road. A good bloke, old Jack. In the nine
years they’d been mates he’d learned to think
a lot of Jack. Of course, Jack was older
than him, and had been to Sydney and Mel-
bourne, hut lie was a real good bloke. You
could trust him for a fair go. And at twenty-
seven, after seventeen years of earning his
living by hard graft, Ted knew that a fair go
was the highest you could get from anyone.
In the moonlight the camp, the lire and old
Jack looking into it and smoking his pipe
looked good. Saunders and the Grayson
crew were all right; hut the camp was
better, the camp and the job. Jack smiled
up at him.
“Get the paper?”
Ted fished it out of his pocket, a smaller
paper fluttering to the ground as he did so.
lie stopped, chuckling, and picked it up.
“What’s the joke, Teddo?"
“You don’t want a ticket in the Flowing
Gold Lottery, I s’pose? Cost yer seven-and-
nine, cash. First prize eight thousand quid.”
Jack unfolded the day-before-yesterday’s
paper. “They must lia’ seen yer cornin’,” lie
said. “What won the 2.80?”
“Winette—eights.” Ted was reading the
Flowing Gold ticket. “Saunders wished it on
me,” lie said, half-sheepishly. “It’s one in a
million, o’ course, but I had the, cash and
they were all at me.”
“Seen yer cornin’,” Jack told him again
without looking up from his paper.
“It’s all 0.k., I tell yer. Every week, an’
all fair and above-board. Lots o’ prizes—
Saunders’s cousin won one last month. But
the odds are too long against yer. They
must be, with prizes like that. What’s the
joke, Jack?”
"I was rememberin’ old Stephen Banks,
a bloke I cleared with, out beyond Dubbo.
He used to buy some sort of a ticket pretty
near every week. An’ ’e never won two bob.
I believe ’e’d ’ave been narked if he had. It
was like an itch on 'im, to keep on payin’
out for Buckley’s chance. I s’pose you’ll
go an’ get the same itch, now you’ve started?”
Ted laughed. “What do you take me for?”
he asked.
* * * #
A good bit of the belt by the creek was
clear when Ted went into Grayson again.
Again the camp and the job and old Jack
looking into the fire received him. He gave
Jack the paper.
“You know that ticket o’ mine, Jack?”
There was a half-triumphant note in his
voice.
“What ticket?”
“The Flowing Gold —I bought it off Saun-
ders.”
“Oh yairs. What about it?”
“Well, it was 10,783. And 10,782 —won!
I was only one figure off the 8000 quid!”
Jack took his right leg from under him and
stretched. “Well, somebody had to be one
off it, didn’t they?”
“Yes. But”—- Ted’s eyes were staring
into the fire now. “I was one off it... .
I bought another ticket to-night. You never
can tell —if someone's got to be one off it,
someone’s got to get it.” His gaze shifted to
old Jack deep in the paper. “We’ll go halves,
Jack,” lie said, “if I get anything.”
Jack looked up. “Don’t be a mug. Why
should I get halves in your luck? You stick
to the lot. If you get it.”
“No. It’s a fair go. We’re mates in the
job, an’ we’ll be mates in the luck. If I
get it, or anything, half’s yours.”
“Don’t be a mug. I’d look line with 4000
quid of your money in me pocket, wouldn’t
I? Besides, you’d forget it an’ me an’ the
job if you did just happen to strike it —your
troubles about this lot with 8000 quid!”
“Yer silly cow!”
Ted's laughing eyes turned to the lire
again. "Don’t we go halves in everything?”
lie said presently. "The job an’ the cheque,
even the tucker? I wouldn’t feel right,
spendin’ it on me' own. Yer know I wouldn’t.
It wouldn’t be a fair go.”
In the end Jack gave in. “Have it yer
own way, Ted, if you pinch the prize I get
half. Now about old Blayney, across the
creek. He was over to-night to know if we’d
take on that dirty bit at the back of his
place, down to the old road. I said we’d got
all of two months here first, an’ that I’d see
you about it. I low about it?”
“Whatever you say, Jack. You’re the boss.
It’d be handy; not far to shift camp, an’
all that. How’s Blayney for cash?”
“(Joodo. And not mean, they tell me.
We’ll look it over an’ give him a price.”
Jack got up. “llow is it for a bit o’ shut-
eye?” he said.
Ted got to a good deal more than saplings
as he cut steadily through the belt by the
creek. At times they seemed to be getting on
his nerves a bit, too. As his axe sank
freshly into each one the thought crossed his
mind that this might bo the last he’d ever
cut, that Saunders might come buzzing into
NOTHING DOING.
BASHER: "I ’ates them blokes wot spends their money on dorgs when there are so
many pore 'ungry people could do with it!”
the camp on his motor-bike to tell him that
lie was worth 8000 quid. It seemed silly at
times to be slogging into these trees '
Eight thousand! You could do a lot with
£BOOO. Get down to Sydney and kick about.
Flash clobber —half a dozen suits with a
different pair of tan shoes to each one. Sport
—the races. Real feeds at the swell pubs....
He shook the fumbling thought away.
Rut they came back, while the clearing
of the creek belt went on, but not so steadily.
Each passing day saw him at work without the
clear thoughtless eyes of other days. The
possibilities of £BOOO controlled three-
quarters of his working personality. There
was Europe— you could get a good trip out
of that lump of cash: see all these famous
cities and townships you read about in the
paper. Working out the rough details of a
European trip with a lawless incident here
and there took up a good while, till the
third list of Plowing Gold winners was pub-
lished, Ted’s number being nowhere near
a prize. He bought another ticket and went
back to the camp.
“We’ll be late getting on to Blayney’s job,”
Jack said. “There’s more in this lot than I
thought there was.”
“Yes,” Ted replied indifferently, handing
him the paper. "I’ll turn in, Jack. I’m a
bit tired.”
“Yes, you don’t look too clever lately.
Get a good sleep.”
A yacht, now—that was the flash thing
to do: go round the world in your own yacht.
He didn’t know whether £81)00 would run to
a yacht; but you needn’t stop at winning
only one lottery. A run of luck might bring
three of them in—£24,000! That would
make the yacht a certainty. You could
touch at what ports you liked, have a bit of
a jollo at each one, and then clear off.
These islands, too, that old Faraday used
to chew the rag about. One time when he
was a sailor he got left on his uppers in
Tahiti and took a job there. To hear him
talk about the dames and the booze! Tahiti
M be a bosker place to go ashore for a spell.
All one day Ted spent on a fumbling pic-
ture put together from his half-memories of
old Faraday’s talk. In the red heart of the
lire he could see the palms and the dames,
hear the music while lie had his booze, with
no thought of work. He’d had enough of
work, been at it since be was ten
“Something on yer mind, Teddo?”
“No.” Veiled eyes glanced at .Tack and
back at the fire. “No. Bit tired, p’r’aps.”
Jack pulled at bis pipe for a moment.
“Want a scoot?” he asked.
“Me? No fear, not with a job half done,
I’m all right, .Tack.”
‘How's your Flowing Gold?”
Ted laughed and flushed. “It’s all right.
G’night, Jack.”
* * * *
In the middle of a dance at a flash pub
in Paris, Ted put down his axe and stared
into the yelloAv waters of the creek. He’d
forgotten that half his 8000 was Jack’s
For a long moment his unseeing eyes
watched the sluggish water. Old .hack.
The swine. What the hell could a bloke
do on 4000? The whole 8000 was little
enough.... Presently he picked up the axe
again and went to work, his eyes not veiled
but hard and over-bright. Seven tickets
he’d bought for that cow to slip a fortune
into his pocket. The axe seemed to flash
malevolently in the slanting sunshine.
Jack took his pipe out of his mouth and
looked at Ted. “What’s bitin’ yer, Teddo?”
lie asked mildly. “You got a dirty tongue
to-uigkt.”
“Who wouldn’t have a dirty tongue?”——
Ted glared at him across the lire. “You
go an’ dump us down in a hell of a job like
this; an’ then you lock us up with this fool
Blayney without a by-yer-leave or any other
damn thing! Who wouldn’t have a dirty
tongue?”
“Yer talkin’ through yer neck, Teddo,”
Jack said still pleasantly. “What you want’s
sleep.”
Ted continued to talk through his neck:
and at last, to dodge the light he was clearly
determined to force on him, Jack turned in.
But that was the way, Ted told himself
next morning: to work up a light with him
and then clear out. Of course, Jack wouldn't
light if lie could help it; he was after his
4000, the swine. But—Ted sniggered at
liis gleaming axe—he’d make him light. These
prizes were too small as it was; it was
funny, with all the money they got for
tickets, that the prizes were kept so low.
lie reckoned there was a take-down some-
where. Well, that was nothing new; there
were take-downs everywhere—look nt Jack
and his 4000.
Port Said—he’d read a bit about Port
Said in the paper one time —rose, dusty
and pungent, before his mind, and he sur-
rendered to it. Leaning on his axe he watched
the jollo unfold....
“Look, Teddo, old Blayney was over
dinner-time. He reckons we ought to be;
starting his job this week. When can yer
get clear of”
“Tell him to choke himself,” Ted snarled.
“I wouldn’t touch his job with a ten-foot
pole. And look, Bellamy, I touch no more
jobs with you.”
Jack stared at him. “What’s got into
yer, Ted?”
“I’m full up. Look, if you want the
strength of it, I never seen that last cheque
of Slattery’s—all I got was what you said
was my half”
Jack’s face seemed to blanch suddenly
in the firelight. Like a cat he was on his
feet confronting Ted, with his right fist
hauled back. But after a moment the fist,
dropped. “(Jo ter Hell, yer pup,” lie said.
“Ye’re shickered. (Jet yer tucker an’ turn
in. I’ll talk to yer in the mornin’.”
He lit his pipe and strolled away into the
bush.
The skunk! Trust him to dodge the row
and hang on to his four thousand. Blast
him!
He took the billy off the ashes, and went
back, flicking the paper off the tree-trunk is
he sat down. What was the paper doing
here? And yesterday’s—Blayney must have
left it. That would save him - a walk to
Grayson. He took a drink of tea and opened
the paper.
“Jack! .Tack!”
The voice rang out into the bush. Jack
strolled into the fire-lit circle. “Well, what
is it? - ’ he asked, cold weather-beaten eyes
on Ted’s triumphant face.
“I’ve won a prize, Jack! Fifty Weedin'
quid—blime, look at it!” Ted was thrusting
the paper at him, Ted on fire with success,
his eyes alight and clear. “Fifty quid!” lie
babbled on. “This is where we go on a
spree, Jack, a real bang-up 25-quid-apiece
spree, before we bog into Blayney’s.”
HILLARY LOFTING.
The Thrush.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I heard a thrush in a bright tree.
It sang with poignant ecstasy;
It sang of English fields I’ve seen
Oft in my dreams, dew-pearled and green ;
Of primroses and daffodils
That light the fragrant vales and hills;
It sang of little dreaming towns
Tucked ’neath smooth, undulating downs;
Of little cobbled streets that creep,
Around, about them, red and steep;
It sang of houses, small and thatched.
With open doors and gates unlatched ;
Of English heartlu and fireside nooks,
With shelves of well-loved, well-thumbed
books;
It sang of bells, insistent, sweet,
That bring good folk on quiet feet
To church each peaceful Sabbath day
To worship God in their own way;
It sang of snow that softly lights
The countryside on winter nights.
So sweet and strange to m e it seemed.
Though long and often I have dreamed
Of England, through a songbird’s power
To really roam one lonely hour
Through English lanes, o’er English hills,
Lit up with golden daffodils.

Information Sought.
Information about the C.A.S.E, Co., in
which I hold shares. In view of the balance-
sheets., etc., disclosinfi fine profits, how is it
possible for the eo. (now in liquidation) not
to be able to pap us anythinp ?—B46.
The profit shown in a co.’s accounts is
only an estimate, as a rule. At no time
has a co. completed all the business in hand,
so it does not know how any transaction
will finally result. In this case, looking
back on transactions since completed, the
liquidators find that instead of profits of
£20.844 and £30,085 in the co.’s years 1923
and 1!>24. there actually were losses of
£5250 and £20,21)0. For the next 11 months
there was a loss of £53.955. Meantime the
co. had gone heavily in debt, and some of the
creditors Avere secured —the bank chiefly. Of
course they got the first cut in the liquida-
tion. The liabilities at date of liquidation
were £222,704. Assets were supposed to be
£333,831. But £52,830 was struck off as
valueless (goodwill, preliminary exes. etc.).
That left £281,015. Thus far £11)2,284 has
been realised; but £00,911) of it has gone in
costs, duty and charges. The bank's debt is
almost wiped off; after that anything real-
ised will be for the benefit of general (un-
secured) creditors. But it won’t be much.
Shareholders, of course, will not receive a
penny; it is lucky for them that their shares
were fully paid, otherwise calls would cer-
tainly have to be made to the full amount
of the capital unpaid.
Will fresh■ milk treated the same as cream
e real Hally become batter? —828.
It seems likely that the first butter was
made from milk. Certainly the ancient
Egyptian made it from milk by subjecting
it to agitation in bags made from the skins
of animals. If milk or cream be agitated
at a temperature somewhat below the melt-
ing-point of butter-fat the particles of fat
as they pass one another agglutinate them-
selves into masses, and. the process being
continued, the first formed masses continue
uniting until, finally the whole body of fat
is brought together in a practically solid
mass.
(1) What teas the total percentage of
physically unfit in the last medical exami-
nation for senior cadets and citizen forces?
(2) Of those unfit what were the respect ire
percentages for (a) undersized, (ft) weak
heart, (c) defective vision, (d) pigeon-chest,
(c) flat feet, (f) any other defects not here
m cut io n cd ? —699.
(1) For the last period for which figures
are available 20,691 trainees were examined
for the Senior Cadets, of whom 5260 (25.4
per cent.) were rejected; 20.008 were ex-
amined for the Citizen Forces and 6723
(33.6 per cent.) rejected. This does not
mean, however, that the numbers rejected
are necessarily unfit for any civil vocation.
Trainees are rejected because they are either
physically unfit (failure to reach the pre-
scribed standards) or because they are unfit
for medical reasons, The minimum stan-
dards for the Citizen Forces are: Medium
and Heavy Artillery, height sft. 6in., chest
measurement 34in. Army Ordnance Corps,
sft. sin. and o34in. Other arms, sft. 4in.
and 334 in. Trainees for the Citizen Forces
are medically examined in May of the year
in which they will attain their eighteenth
birthday, and consequently a proportion do
not reach 18 until months after the date of
the medical examination. A.I.F. standards
wore oft. 2in. and 33in. Therefore large
numbers of C.F. trainees who are slightly
under the height or chest measurements can-
not be regarded as medically unfit in the
ordinary sense of the term. (2) Informa-
tion is not available.
Tell me how to make cream cheese. —B37.
Approximately 1240 z. can be made from
lib. thick cream, preferably separated. Take
the required quantity of thick sweet cream
and place in a clean cloth of very fine calico
or linen. Tie the corners firmly together
and hang it up in a cool draughty place for
12 to 24 hours.. (The time will vary accord-
ing to the weather.) Then take the cloth
and place it in an earthenware howl, when
it will be found that the cream is much
thinner in the mass than on the outside. Get
a wooden knife and scrape the thick cream
down from the sides of the cloth, stir it
round so as to mix, and hang it up again
for about six hours. Now a cloth of more
open texture may be used and the cream
should be changed to a clean cloth at least
three times a day, until it is of a sufficient
consistency to work up into small blocks
with pats. Times of working vary accord-
ing to weather, but the oftener the cloths
are changed the shorter the time, and in any
case it will take at least three days even
when placed in a good drying draught of air.
A sweeter and better cheese is made and
ripening is hastened by frequently changing
the cloths. Cloths should be thoroughly
washed and boiled and used for cheese only.
This type of cheese is very susceptible to
taint and should be kept away from all such
articles as onions, meat, etc. Cool drying
winds or draughts, and sweet, clean flavored
cream are essential to obtain good results.
Hare any arrangements been made by the
Rural Bank re loans for farmers who have
lost pigs due to swine fever? I have lost all
mine —4o head. How do I apply for loan? —
928. . . '
No special provision lias been made. If
your property is not mortgaged elsewhere,
you could secure a loan under ordinary con-
ditions. Rural Industries Branch, llamilton-
street, Sydney, is considering tin 1 question;
and it might be able to assist. Make early
application. If you are a returned soldier
apply to the Soldier Settlements Branch

lie (N.Q.) are invaded by small black
ants. They arc everywhere in the house —
in cupboards, ports., etc. Can you supply
a remedy ? —915.
Tartar emetic is good. As much as will
go on a sixpence should be mixed with honey
and put around. A mixture of corrosive
sublimate and glycerine used in the same
way is also effective. Both are poisons, so
care should be taken not to let children
or animals near them. Or this: Allow one
pint of red spraying oil to one pint of water
and a good pinch of soap extract. To one
part of this mixture allow live parts of
water. Paint this mixture along the tracks
of tlie ants and right up to their boles, it
possible. As long as there is any trace of
this the ants will not come near. Pbenyl in
the scrubbing water and turpentine painted
along their tracks is also a good combina-
tion.

London andl the same in Adelaide, assuming
that 20s. in London purchases 20*. worth■

The Commonwealth Statistician reports
that on the basis of the comparative cost of
food and groceries only, tin' amount neces-
sary in April, 1927, to purchase in Adelaide
what could be obtained for £1 in London

Docs the X.H.W. Mate Mines Department
assay metals for private persons? Is the
assay free? Is there any other information
on the subject the prospector should hare?
905.
With the object of encouraging prospecting,
auriferous and other ores are assayed and
minerals examined and named free of charge.
Samples should be addressed to Govt. Geolo-
gist, care of the department. The ores and
minerals must be from N.S.W. deposits.
Samples must not be finely crushed. If broken
up they must consist of particles large enough
to admit of examination. Samples should
weigh about lib. each and be fairly repre-
sentative of the lode or deposit, not picked
specimens. The department will not assay
samples in which free gold is visible to the
naked eye, or for the purpose of checking the
work of private assayers, or of tailings and
concentrates from batteries or other crushing
mills.
(1) Which gives the better results, pow-
der-or liquid dip, when used for dipping
sheep; and why? (2) How do costs com-
pare?—7B2
(1) Most people use powder dip, from
which it can be judged that the majority
believes it gives the best results. It mixes
better, penetrates the wool and dries with
a slight residue on the fibres, which drives
in with the weather, and clings a bit longer
than tin' liquid. Some men, including one of
the judges at the sheep show, who is a very
experienced station-manager, believes in a
half-and-half mixture. Thomas's paste dip
(obtainable from Commonwealth Wool Co..
3 Bent-street. Sydney; £4 per case of 4 201 b.
tins) gives just about the same effect as
tins. It is the only one of the kind on the
market. (2) The cost of the powder and
the liquid work out at about the same, but
the paste dip is slightly cheaper.
Ts there a cure for contagious abortion
in cattle? —811.
Isolate the affected cow or cows. Search
for and burn the foetus, and, if possible, run
a fire over the tainted pasture. Disinfect
sheds, bails, etc., and limewash. As soon
as possible wash down the cow with disin-
fectant ; flush the cow out with salt and
water (loz. to a gallon; boil it first). Keep
her away from the bull for at least three
months. The gentleman may want syringing,
too: but he is not often to blame, though
lie ought to be kept in a bull-paddock and
not with the cows.
What do you know about the Rotary
Brick Press Co.. Ltd. ’ — BBB.
Very little. The business of the co. seems
to be to sell brick-making machinery, but

any have been made.

4!)(i. —To cure that tank in which. the
water persists in keeping dirty it is neces-
sary to have it cleaned out with a bottom-
less scoop. When put down it was com-
pleted on an unstable bottom, and it must
now be deepened and cleaned up upon a
solid clay foundation. Perhaps the first bot-
tom was struck and dug through in sinking,
so more work will be required to reach the
next layer of solid. A shallow silt-tank

plucked duckweed. Now when she sees a
sign of a chilblain she hunts for one of the
weeds, rubs the ’blain with the exudation and
in a day or so all trace of the trouble is

Before you join
the homeward throng
'—take this precaution
THESE are the days of lowered vitality—of systems
open to the attacks of germs, PARTICULARLY
THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMON COLDS,
INFLUENZA AND PNEUMONIA. It is a wise
precaution, therefore, to guard against infection
before joining the crowds travelling home by tram or
train by taking
One Wolfe's Schnapps a day
for your health's sake .
Take it with a squeeze of lemon, a little sugar and hot or cold
water, as you prefer. The antiseptic value of alcohol, distilled
to the highest degree of purity as in Wolfe’s Schnapps, cannot
be overestimated according to the highest medical authority.
The extract of Italian Juniper that Wolfe’s contains has the
effect of toning up the whole system by the riddance of
bodily poisons.
With a bottle of Wolfe’s Schnapps
in your home, you can take further
precautions by having another
Wolfe’s immediately on your
arrival. Obtainable in quarter,
half and large sized bottles.


A test of reliability
The Six Days’ Stock Machine Trial, organised by the A.C.U., is rightly regarded by all motor-
cyclists as the best test of the reliability of the modern motor cycle.
This event is not a race nor a freak trial. The motor cycles are selected from manufacturers’
stocks by A.C.U. officials and are therefore absolutely standard machines in every respect, just
as the public buy. The course for the first five days was mainly over by-lanes, including many
difficult hills, which severely tested brakes, engines, gears and chain parts. A schedule speed of
20 m.p.h. was maintained throughout. The sixth day was devoted to an exhaustive examina-
tion of machines by A.C.U. officials and marks were deducted for any mechanical defects, poor
condition, inefficient brakes, etc.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Epsom and Metropolitan doubles beginning
with Boaster have been sought after in
Sydney since the Horsley Handicap was
run at Warwick Farm. Carrying lOst. 41b.,
a stone more than his Epsom weight, the
sturdy Magpie—Galtee Princess gelding
vanquished a field of 16, some of them decent
sprinters, at the Farm, answering challenges
with all his old gameness and galloping the
six furlongs in lmin. 14sec. —pretty fair
time for the course. He went out at 7 to 1,
having eased fi’om fours. Cawnpore (6 to 1)
ran a good race and was only half a length
away at the finish; and Reference (14 to 1),
after making all the running and beating off
Cadenza, was a close third. This little St.
Anton gelding will be worth following after
he has had a spell; he is evidently improving
with age, as Waranton and other members
of the family did. Beelgah (20 to 1) led
for seven of the 10 furlongs in. the July
Handicap, and looked a likely winner half
a mile from home. Entei’ing the straight,
she and St. Eaton (7 to 2), who had tackled
her, moved out and Hinchinbrook (5 to 1),
shooting up on the rails —Fruend, her appren-
tice rider, cleverly availed himself of the
opening—won nicely from St. Eaton and
Edgardo (6 to 1), Beelgah being a close
fourth. Hinchinbrook has been very con-
sistent this season. So has St. Eaton, for
that matter, but his party’s luck has been
out.
Pedestal, a half-brother (by Valais) to
Polycletan, winner of the 1924 Metropolitan,
downed a field of tw T o-ycar-olds (Windbag’s
half-sister Ardennes among them) in very
stylish fashion. Dan Lewis trains the inter-
esting gelding, as he did Polycletan ; it was
the youngster’s first start, and the price
was ’l2 to 1. Toohey, who hasn’t neai’ly
as many followers as he used to have,
rewarded those who have stuck to him by
riding the winners of the divided Leumeah
Handicap. In the first division he induced
King Val (14 to 1) to race generously for
once, and that big Valais colt got the best
of an exciting tussle with Bunting Wallace
(12 to 1) and Onward (20 to 1) ; in the
second division it was only by half a head
that Toohey’s mount, Chris (5 to 2), defeated
Bacagi (5 to 1), ridden by Davidson, after
they had been locked together for a furlong
and a half. It was a thrilling end to a
pleasant day’s racing.

Randwick and Warwick Farm will miss
J. J. Garvan, who generally had a horse or
two in training. North Logan was the latest
to carry the Garvan colors —white, red arm-
bands, red cap—to victory, but better nags
than North Logan were owned by the late
chairman of the board of the directors of the
Commonwealth Bank, though he is by no
means bad. With Braehead, Garvan won
the Carrington Stakes in 1922; that speedy
old fellow died only a few weeks ago. Comp-
troller was also above the average; J.J.G.
had hopes of capturing a Cup with him
after his third to Sir Andrew and David in
the Metropolitan and first in the Waverley
Handicap, but the chestnut son of Sir Digh-
ton —Sibar did not train on. Clan Robert
was also Garvan’s for a couple of seasons.
But the big fellow became Norman Falkiner’s
not long before he won the Grand National
Steeple.

“Carpet”: The failure of the appeal lodged
by Jimmy Munro and his associates in the
Songgift case against the disqualifications
imposed by the A.J.C. stipendiary stewards
will react with particular severity on Munro.
Not only will he be unable to follow his
profession at the A.J.C., V.A.T.C. and V.RjC.
spring and autumn meetings—incidentally he
would probably have had the mount on
Boaster in the Epsom and Bacchus in the
Metrop.—and the races in between, but he
will be unable to ride work or otherwise
keep his hand in and his weight down by
race- or training-track activities during the
period of his suspension. The monetary loss
will be a severe one, running into some thou-
sands of pounds, and, in addition, there
is the danger which
threatens ever y
lightweight jockey
who suddenly goes
out of training—
tli e increase i u
weight which so
often proves irre-
ducible. With that,
there is the pros-
pect of being un-
able to regain the
old mastery after
long absence from
the saddle. And
in order to stop an
obscure prad in a
suburban handicap
almost as obscure,
the lad risked all
that! People still
find it hard to be-
lieve him capable
of such imbecility.
* *
“Amateur
Urger”: The end
justifies the means,
no doubt, but there
seems something-
daring in offering a
racehorse as first
prize in a lottery
to be drawn in Syd-
ney for the benefit
of the Kindergarten
Union. The nag in
question, Sunflare
(imp.), by Sunstar
(winner of the 1911
Derby) out of an
Orby mare, was not
a gift to the union,
either, but was de-
liberately purchased
to figure as first
prize. No doubt
the union counts on
the sporting appeal
to touch many
pockets hitherto
buttoned tight
against the lure of
kindergartens, but
the scheme has its
possible drawbacks.
It is inevitable, in
the nature of such
things, that the
three-year-old stal-
lion will be won by a
local curate, an old maid or the president of
an anti-gambling society, or someone else to
whom the ownership of the worldly prize will
be a mockery and an embarrassment.
* * * *
Sandhurst, at his best (he wasn't at bis
best in Sydney last month), is a brilliant
performer over the battens. Lady Rooka,
in trying to jump with him, practically from
the flag-fall, found him far too tough a
proposition in the Leamington Hurdle at
Caulfield on Saturday. After her runaway
win in the Doutta Galla Hurdle at Fleming-
ton the Narcisse mare was always first
choice—7 to 2 was the closing quote—Sand-
hurst and Seafit being in the market at 0 to
1, and Fiscus, Telarno and Brightsword at
8 to 1. Sandhurst was soon in front, and
Lady Rooka running up to him before they
had gone three furlongs, the pair raced to-
gether, except that Sandhurst gained at
every obstacle. There was only a length
between them at the last hurdle, but Lady
Rooka was done with before the distance,
and Sandhurst won easily by two lengths
from the fast-finishing Bindweed (15 to 1),
who was a length and a half in front of
another 15-to-l shot, Black Allen. Sand-
hurst was ridden in Bob Inkson’s most
dashing style.
Despite his load of 12st. 10Jb., most people
would have nothing but Brenda’s Son in the
Godfrey Watson Steeple, 3 to 1 being the
best price offered. Johnny Cake and Welcome
Stranger were next in order at 5 to 1. The
favorite was in front for a mile and a half,
but from then on the lightweights worried
him, and lie dropped right out. Johnny Cake,
taking charge from West Wimmera (14 to
1) about six furlongs from home, was never
afterwards headed; he had an advantage of
two lengths at the finish over Welcome
Stranger, who was just about his own
length clear of Flowering Gum (7 to 1).
Johnny Cuke, who is owned by two ladies,
looks like turning out a first-class ’chaser.
Tommy Butler rode him.
Each of the seven starters in the Murrum-
beena Handicap, 11 furlongs, had backing,
Textile and Valorem getting most support
at 3to 1 and a shade better. Llunthony tried
to make his usual runaway act of it, but
below the distance Sailing Home (7 to 1)
had charge from Textile, with Anun Louise
(5 to 1), who hud been in the rear early,
coming fast on the outside. The Western
District mare just got up in time to beat
Sailing Home by a neck, with Textile half
a length away. There were 2(i apprentice
riders posted tor the Kambrook Trial, and it.
was belatedly decided to run it in divisions.
“MORAL” SUPPORT.
MISS INNOCENCE : “If I had absolutely no chance of losing, that
wouldn’t be betting, would it?”
BOOKIE: “Aw, no, lady!”
MISS INNOCENCE : “Then, do tell me what is perfectly certain
to win, because Fathah made me promise not to bet.”
The first division was taken by Jack Shep-
herd (3 to 1), who comfortably defeated
two outsiders, Bonnie Bob and Fortafest;
and Jocularity (3 to 1) was just a long
head too good for Citrosma (25 to 1) in
the second division. A. G. Barlow broke a
long run of “outs” when his imported horse
Phonic (8 to 1), who had failed often,
lasted long enough to settle Diamond Plume
(16 to 1) and Tullius (7 to 2) in the Mal-
vina Welter. Vie. Sleigh had the mount
on the English horse—he also didn’t win out
of his turn.

“Wigs”: We hear a lot about the big
bettors and their fabulous winnings, but
room for the punter who puts his “bobs”
and spare coppers on his fancy! Two illu-
minating extracts from the Answers to Cor-
respondents column of the Argus :
F.G.J. (Colquhoun) : As the backer won 1/10 on
Daylight, that amount went on Pelaco, half each
way.
“Mascot” (Melbourne) : As the backer had 3/G in
hand, he had lOd. each way Epergne and lOd. each
way Willowvn. He should collect 3/4.
Imagine the excitement in the family circle
when Dad proudly announces that lie has

The most important of Vic. League's games
on Saturday was staged at Geelong, where
21,500 paid £604 to see the meeting between
the local team and Collingwood. Geelong had
some system, but in this respect the Magpies
excelled; also the latter w’ere faster, stronger
in the ruck and surer in the air; wherefore
they led throughout, though never by enough
to feel safe. At the end the board showed:
’Wood, 65 points; Geelong, 49. On the Rich-
mond ground Melb. promised to provide a
good game against the locals, but, starting
with five injured players replaced by reserves,
and with two more damaged in the course of
the argument—Wittman played on with a
broken wrist in splints—they had no hope
against the Tigers, whose certainty in hand-
ling the ball and methodical play gave them
an easy victory—7s points to Melb.’s 44.
The only other game that counted was at
South Melbourne, where the Carlton Blues
lost their immediate chance of stepping into
“the four” by succumbing to South’s superior
pace and dash, aided by their own vile goal-
shooting. They scored 8 goals 21 behinds to
South’s 12 goals 8 behinds. St. Kilda beat
Hawthorn by 51) points to 54; Essendon
outed Footscray with 01 points to 57; and
Fitzroy emptied out North Melbourne by 80
points to 74. ’Wood and Richmond are now
at the liead of the ladder; Geelong is a step
lower down, and Carlton and Melb. are sjde
by side on the next rung. During the week
three players were compulsorily retired, two
for eight weeks and one for 12, which means
that they will play no more this season.

There was a tide in the affairs of the St.
George-Eastern Suburbs struggle at the
Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday which,
taken at the flood by the referee, might
have led to both sides being sent off the
field. St. George, with its vision of the
premiership receding from its grasp, has
grown peevish and apt to translate its in-
ability to win games into terms of stoush.
When Eastern Suburbs, fresh from beating
the premiers, South Sydney, made it evi-
dent that it was going to do something of
the kind to the Illawarra side, the latter
lost all pretence of sanctimoniousness. East
led 10-5 at half-time, and St. George set to
work to batter down the defence by brute
force. Had the Saints utilised the great
advantage Justice gave them in obtaining
the ball they would have won easily enough.
As it was they could do no better than
draw, 10-10, in one of the “dirtiest” games
seen on the Cricket Ground for a long time.
One man on each side was sent off, but
there were other and perhaps worse offen-
ders. Pope, the little Eastern scrum-half,
played a great game in defence, as did
Harris and Hardy. Tye and Kelly were
conspicuous in the heavy rucking for St.
George. North Sydney, which has again
picked up the match-winning habit, gave a
demonstration of the fact by beating Uni-
versity, 20-6, Mulheron, a recent, find per-
forming well on the wing. Those old enemies
Balmain and Newtown battled dully to a
dreary finish at Birchgrove, “Newts” emerg-
ing victorious by 15 to 13 after mutual
exchanges of stoush. In the Glebe-Western
Suburbs match West won well by 26
to 7, after a promising start by Glebe.
Here again rough and illegal play is com-
plained of.
“Swing-tli’-boot”: The outbreak of sav-
agery in Rugby League football on Saturday
was met by the authorities with drastic
action. Of six players reported for stoush
three were “cautioned”; another was sus-
pended for one match. All were A grade
players. The others, reserve graders, were
suspended for two matches each; of course,
their competition doesn't “draw.” The
League’s firm stand can be appreciated in
the light of a report by a prominent club
official that one of his men had been badly
bitten in the face, the marks of an excellent
set of teeth remaining as evidence. An
amendment by this official that the offenders
ruthlessly “cautioned” should also be slapped
on the wrist with a pen-holder, or something
like that, was rejected as too brutally vin-
dictive.

In the Rugby Union games University
went further ahead by beating North Sydney
17 to 14. Sheehan was. an absentee from
’Varsity’s ranks in the second half, and
North came near to bringing off a surprise :
A. W. Ross, at full-back, did a good deal
to save the day for Uni. North’s forwards
surprised everyone by their showing against
the powerful Uni. pack, and Pratt, behind
North’s scrum, gave his old ’Varsity mates
no end of trouble,. Manly, now apparently
resigned to its fdte, was beaten again, West
outing the Villagers by 27 to 16. after the
latter had led into the second spell. Lawton
was in great fettle for West. Eastern Sub-
urbs had a tough go with Y.M.C.A., to
win by 21-17. Several of the Waratalis
figured on each side, and the game was
THE LOFTY MOTIVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“After the Bell Bird Handicap at Gosford, a
bookmaker was unable to pay out on the favorite,
Donford, which won. Examination of his book: in
the committee-room showed that he was liable for
£l6l 10s. on Donford, and he had not laid another
horse in the race. His guarantor, another bookmaker,
was sent for, and was so incensed at the situation
disclosed in the book that lie attacked his colleague
furiously, punching him in the face.”- Melbourne
Sun.
He punched, and furiously, they say-
Mayhap, it sounds a sordid fray
With nought to stiffen angry thews
Save thought of lucre one would lose,
The gage of anger rudely flung
By one who feels that lie’s been stung,
The berserk battle raging free
For forfeit of a guarantee.
He punched—no knight in search of grail
More violently could assail
The Paynim horde that barred his path ;
No barracker aroused to wrath
Could even in fond dreaming deal
Such stoush to make an umpire squeal;
He mauled his mate with savage glee—
Ah, was it all for £ s. d.V
No! No! He punched, I would believe,
Not for the loss that he must grieve,
Not for the filthy lucre gone,
Not for the trust imposed upon;
But, with an artist’s honest ire
Who sees his craft dragged in the mire,
Just vengeance on the booby took
Who’d perpetrated such a book!
VICTORIA.
HASEN.

“Samurai”: The mucli-discussed Japanese
Rugby Union football team will definitely
arrive in Sydney on August 8. It is booked
to play six games in N. S. Wales, and
even with the Waratalis gone overseas the
Rugby Union should be able to test the
standard of the visitors. In all probability
the Vic. Rugby Union side which has been
invited to Sydney in August will be in-
cluded in the teams to meet the Japanese.
Considerable curiosity exists among Austra-
lian players as to how the sporting chaps
from Nippon, who are bearing the whole
financial burden of their tour, will fare in
the line-out work, in which height and reach
count for so much.

The first round of the Soccer premiership
ended on Saturday, and the rest of the sea-
son’s games will be played in two divisions,
to the second of which the onee-invineible
Granville has been relegated. Eastern Sub-
urbs paralysed the heads by beating the
crack Woonona team 5-0, for East is well
down the ladder. In the second Soccer
“test” at Brisbane China again succumbed
to, practically, a Queensland team, by 7
goals to 4.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
The Sydney Stadium people put on a
capital programme at "popular prices” on
Saturday night, but it failed to stem the
rush to Epping racecourse, the crowd being
comparatively small. The first of two 15-
rounders was between “The Kaffir’s” son,
Joe Esler (Bst. 1311 b.), and Art Walker
(Sst. 101 b.), a “find” of Pat Kearon’s.
Kearon’s boy carried the fight to the colored
man and beat him in every round, his long
left to the face being a great factor in
Eslcr’s undoing. In the tenth, a right swing
to the jaw jarred Walker, and' when Esler
dragged at his glove the lad was pulled
down. He took eight seconds, but was soon
in the lead again, and received the only
possible decision. Jack Dillon (list. 31b.).
making his first appearance since his return
from abroad, seemed quite untrained, other-
wise he should have polished off the artistic-
ally tattooed Canadian, Mike O’Connor
(list. 2,}1b.). With a right jolt to the
chin he dropped Mike in the second, and
Wallis’s hand was just on the rise for the
“out” when the bell rang. O’Connor is no
boxer, but he is tough and game; he not
only stayed out the 15 rounds, but often had
Dillon huddling up on the ropes. It ended
in a draw—a fair decision.
* * =!=
“H.K.”: “Spiker,” the pride o’ the ’Loo,
was to meet “Basher” Williams, of Balmain,
that night. Grimy and half-conditioned lie
stepped on the scales. “You’re a pound
over,” said the official. “Git ’ome and wash
yerself—an’ p’raps y’ll make it.” “Spiker”
took the hint and vanished. In 10 minutes
lie re-appeared, his face glowdng, his ears
red with rubbing, and his hair parted. lie
jumped on the scales. “Blime,” yelled the
check-weigher, “y’re six ounces under.”
* * * *
Sam Clapham (12st. 101 b.) and Mike
Yokel (12st. 121 b.) swapped grips for the
fourth time at Melbourne on Saturday
night. They have become so used to one
another’s methods that the thrills antici-
pated by the large crowd were lacking:
nevertheless the wrestling was solid, if not
spectacular, and when Bridges crowned each
sweating head at the finish both showed
signs of wear and tear. In the early rounds
Sam did all the scoring and with headlocks
and toeholds gave Mike plenty to think about,
but it was the American who scored the
first fall. Escaping from a head-scissors in
the fifth round, lie caught Clapham in his
Boston crabhold; and the Yorkshireman,
after a few convulsive heaves, capitulated.
The sixth was slow, but in the following
round Sam got even with a crutch hold and
body press. Although he got most of the
points in the last round, the Englishman
had to be content with an even break. He
was again discontented with the decision,
and with some warrant on this occasion.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot”: The lioped-for visit to Aus-
tralia of an English tennis team will not
come off. The official explanation is that
a really representative team cannot be
raked up to go. It is more likely that Eng-
lish form, as revealed at Wimbledon, is so
poor as to make the journey hardly worth
while from any point of view. The women
players seem to be good enough for any
opposition, bar Helen Wills, but among the
men it is difficult to see any capable of
standing up to the first-class Australian side
that is now in sight. It is possible
that a French side will be invited, and
Borotra, Brugnon and Cochet are said to
be willing. They wrnuld be a big draw,
and would furnish priceless example and
experience for Australia’s rising young Davis
Cup aspirants.
* * * *
"Ichabod”: There is an element of sar-
donic humor in the decision of the English
Lawn Tennis Association to appoint a com-
mittee to inquire into the advisability of
holding a native-born championship. It
really seems about the only means of keep-
ing a lawn-tennis championship in the
country, and the idea might well be extended
to golf. But is it worth while? Champion-
ship-hunting by amateurs has developed into
something like a profession, and to the
unsophisticated it is a miracle how many
amateurs who have no visible means of sup-
port make a living. The genuine British
idea of sport for the pleasure got out of it
has long departed from championship func-
tions of all sorts, with their elaborate and
expensive organisation and their carefully
prepared—and expensive—competitors. To
encourage the champion is often to destroy
the sportsman. Many games would be more
sporting for the abolition of the modern
excrescence.
* * * >;i
“Davy's Mug": The European final Of the
Davis Cup is scheduled to begin at Copen-
hagen to-day. “On running” it looks a
moral for the Frenchmen, but one never
knows. Italy gave Borotra. Brugnon and
co. the scare of their young lives, and Den-
mark settled the Englishmen in convincing
fashion. However, form can’t be ignored,
OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP JOTTINGS.
“Perfectly steady going out, Brown collapsed badly on the home journey.”
and the challenge round is pretty sure to see
France and America at it again. America
won last year, 4 —l.
The Nineteenth Hole
Bobby Jones, the young American amateur,
made golf history when he won the British
open championship foi the second time in
succession. His wonderful figures for the
four 18-hole rounds were 68, 72, 73, 72;
lie finished six strokes ahead of Boomer and
Robson, the British professionals, who tied
for second place. The really memorable
feature of Jones’s play was his consistency,
for he is a tremendous driver, and occasional
disaster waits on the best of the “long game”
men. Last year the young man won the
American open as well as the British. Aus-
tralia’s hope, Len Nettlefold, of Tasmania,
opened with a brilliant first round of 71.
He fell away badly in the third and fourth
rounds, ending well down the list with a
total of 318. Joe Kirkwood, tile one-time
Manly caddie, was third with 293.
“Colonel Damurize”: Desecration succeeds
desecration. Following on the account in
your last edition of the appearance of an
American player at St. Andrew’s with clubs
painted in all the colors of the rain-
bow, there now comes news that book-
makers have been trying to bet on the
British open championship. This event,
I need hardly say, is barely less sacro-
sanct than the British Constitution, and the
ruffians, after proceeeding as far as the sixth
green, were turned off. I am informed it is
the custom in America for persons of this de-
scription to follow the play round the links,
laying the odds on the match, the hole and
even the stroke. It is a matter for congratu-
lation that St. Andrew’s has risen in the true
Scottish spirit to the occasion. It is bad
enough that the Americans should take away
British championships. To allow them to
take away British money, and that from
Scottish soil, is not to be borne.
* * * *
“Ploughman”: The Queensland golf cham-
pionships stayed at home, for the most part,
in spite of the strong invasion of N.S.W. and
Victorian players. E. Fitzpatrick and T.
Hall retained their foursomes title, while ,1.
N. Radeliffe did the same by liis State
amateur championship. The open, which
came to N.S.W. in Tommy Howard’s keep-
ing, was the only loss.
* # * *
“Hotliam”: Melbourne University has set
its Australian sisters a good example by de-
ciding to form a golf club. The game has
long been granted a full Blue at Oxford and
Cambridge, and those universities have moth-
ered many leading British amateurs, includ-
ing Cyril Tolley. Melbourne’s beginning
should be followed by Sydney Uni. at least:
for a start it could find room for a few prac-
tice holes in University Park.
* * * *
“Kirkwood Jones”: Not always is the cost
of holing out in one threatening (P».
14/7/’27). At the Ashdown Forest club,
Sussex, there is a hole known as the “island.”
Some years ago a visitor was so pleased
with landing it in one that he endowed it
with a fiver, the accumulated interest to go
to the next man to perform his feat. Though
a good many have sacrificed the hole in try-
ing to pick up the accumulation, it hasn't
been done yet. The man who first collects
will be able to do the whole 18 in one without
being out of pocket.
* * % *
“Sod-raiser”: Touching unorthodox golf
clubs (B. 23/6/’27). A man I saw recently
on Adelaide’s Mount Lofty course had, in-
stead of a standard putter, a heavy old ash
walking-stick with a bent handle. Another
player sported a niblick whose shaft was a
piece split from a broken sulky shaft and
spokeshaved to shape, with a grip made by
forcing a piece of garden-hose on one end.
The head was made of a 3in. piece of a
blacksmith's rasp rivetted to a piece of steel
tubing, the “cut” surface of the rasp being
ground off slightly so as not to cut the cover
of the ball. They were both elderly men who
had played the royal and exasperating game
for the greater part of their lives, and each
said lie would not sell his mongrel club for
its weight in silver.
Car and Cycle
“Tin Liz": A useful veteran is Basil San-
derson’s “Hup.,” which has recently com-
pleted 60,000 miles with its owner, and
will claim 10,000 more by the time its latest
journey from Perth to Queensland and back
has been finished. No record-breaking has
been attempted, though a day’s run of 383
miles was put up in W.A. on the east-
ward journey.
# * :>
“Bushing” : ’Pile latest speeding stuut re-
ported from America is 171 m.p.li. in a
Miller 1500 c.c., driven by Frank Lockhart.
It was done from a flying start, and the dis-
tance was exactly a mile; the course was
the dried-up bed of Lake Muroc, California.
The going here is smooth, hard mud, and the
bed has a circumference of some 20 miles,
witli plenty of room for a straight mile. It
sounds attractive, but the Westralians will
never admit that it beats their Lake Per-
kolilli, near Kalgoorlie. “the finest natural
speedway in the world.”
*i : * « #
“Domitian II.”: Nothing quite so breezy
as motor-cycle racing seems to have hap-
pened along since the lions and the Christians
used to go to a finish in the Roman arenas.
A brisk account of a Brisbane injecting
tells how “Peter Smith, riding at a terrific
speed, dashed through the outer fence and
careered through light trees into the creek;
the trees could be seen quivering as man and
machine plunged through. Then Pritchard
skidded badly and fell. Ben. Unwin, com-
ing along at a terrific speed, skilfully avoided
the prostrate rider, but knocked the foot-
board from his machine. Unwin kept on
riding, finished second, and fainted on his
machine. There was another thrill when
Charlie Spinks crashed into the outer fence,
and yet another when Frank Arthur fell in
front of the judge’s stand.” That’s the red-
meat stuff!

“Endorsed”: “Getting past the John” in
Australia is a simple matter compared with
getting one’s license in Argentina. First of
all, the applicant for an Argentine license
must attend the police-station with his pass-
port. The police then revise his dossier,
which means looking up his “record.” A
week or so later he was to undergo an eye-
sight test, and after that he must show the
traffic department that he is a competent
driver. That costs the equivalent of 18s.,
and if he fails he must wait three weeks
before going up again, at the cost of another
18s. Then he has to produce evidence that
the ciir is his and that no one else is allowed
to drive it. For private drivers must own
their cars, and every different make (if a
man has more than one one) requires a new
examination, with separate fees for each, of
course. And every year sees a new number-
plate, which has to be sealed by responsible
authority—with fees attaching.

“Rolls-Liz": An English writer has been
forecasting the motor-car of 20 years hence.
The internal-combustion engine will, he pre-
dicts, have gone to the scrap-heap; cars will
be driven by electricity “wirelessed” from
central generating stations. The cars will
be two-wlieeled, balanced by gyroscopes, also
driven by wireless “juice,” and will attain
tremendous speeds on specially-constructed
roads. How Jones will prevent Smith from
filling his accumulators with the power Jones
has ordered and paid for is not mentioned,
nor is there any reference to the plight of
the pedestrian on those whizz-bang roads-to-
be. Perhaps pedestrians .will all have been
killed out by then, hardy race as they are.
The prophet’s final conclusion is that tiie car
of those days will “very nearly look after
itself." which irresistibly recalls Mr. Jor-
rocks’s commentary on his hounds: “ ’Andy
as ladies’ maids —does everything but pay
their own pikes."
* * * *
“Trembler”: An engine with a variable
stroke and compression ratio,, the invention
of a French engineer named Demblone, is
attracting attention in Europe, Designed
and tested as an aeroplane engine, it lias
been taken up by several European car
manufacturers, Peugeots among them. The
alteration brought about is to raise the
dimension of an engine from under 1500 c.c.
with a 4 to 1 compression ratio to two litres
with a 6 to 1 ratio. This is effected by an
eccentric support to the big end of each con-
necting rod, and the alteration can be made
while the engine is running.

“Old T.”: Henry Ford's latest notion is
to take a leaf out of the book of the people
who reconstruct typewriters “recondition-
ing." the Yankees call it. About half the
families in America are able to afford a
Lizzie, at least. To get hold of another 25
per cent. Ford proposes to buy in old pro-
ducts of his art, replace .all hopelessly worn
parts with new ones and sell the result with
a factory guarantee, llis statisticians say
this will cost on an average £l2 a car. As
the supply of superannuated Fords is large
and steadily increasing, and their market
value is small, the new enterprise won’t
lack for scope.

“Garry”: Having got to the stage where
more than half the families in his realm own
cars- —the exact figure is 55.7 per cent.—
Facie Sam is pushing on to the goal of one
car for each adult. At last counting
15,317,500 families out of a total of 27,500,000
families owned cars, and 2,700,000 families
owned more than one car. The latest Yankee
theory is that it is more profitable to keep
an otd car than to sell it.

“The Juice”: Petrol from coal has been
a long-sought ideal, but hitherto none of the
many processes tried has been commer-
cially successful. It is now claimed by the
German Chemical and Dye Trust 'that the
Bergin process it has adopted fulfils all
requirements, and two large plants are be-
ing erected to produce motor fuel from
coal. The process is said to be simple. One
ton of bituminous coal yields 104 gallons
of oil, distillation giving 45 per cent, of
petrol: the remainder is largely lubricant
and fuel oils. Australia, with its heavy,
bituminous coals, should offer a fine field
for the new process if the thing is what it
is cracked up to be.

“Altcar” : The meat dogs and the tin hare
drew another huge mob of plump, juicy
punters to Epping (N.S.W.) racecourse on
Saturday night. There were 30.000 punters,
it is calculated, and 187 bookmakers gathered
to the' feast. Epping is now too small for
the crowds clamoring to lose their money and
the pencillers seeking licenses to win it, and
a change will have to be made. A gentle-
men's agreement with one of the pony-racing
magnates might solve the problem.

Among the starters in the Vic. Waterloo
Cup at Geelong was an ancient greyhound,
distinctly grey about the muzzle —Carter
Bros.' Terminus. He didn’t win, but GO dogs
had been sent to the right-about before the
old fellow went down : five of them had seen
the winner of four Waterloos slipping away
in front. Then the aged flier, damaged in a
lengthy bye, limped to slips on three legs, and
was beaten a length by Jew’s Harp, a young
hound lightly run, after a bitterly fought
G3sec. course. Orion next outed Buckley’s
heavyweight mover Bold Booty. The final
was never in doubt; Terminus’s conqueror
led going away and took the points like traffic
in Little Bourke-street. all one way. Ter-
minus was favorite from card-call to defeat:
his owners stood to win £4OOO for an outlay
of £GOO. Jew’s Harp's win landed his owners
fa South Aust. confederation) a clear £2OOO.
“Fitzcray”: Mildura rowing club had a
bad spin recently when a fire destroyed its
four racing eights. The club has nominated
for the Grand Challenge at Ilenley-on-Yarra,
and withdrawal was not to be thought of, so a
contract for a new clinker-built eight was
given to George Towns. It is being built in
three parts, like the eight used in Sydney by
the Maorilanders in 1925, and can be taken to
pieces for transport. This will enable it to be
carried in any ordinary truck, a convenience
which those who have experienced the worry
and anxiety of shifting a long eight of the
old type by land or sea will appreciate.
"Slide’': When the Australian Rowing
Council meets again it will discuss several
recommendations from the Vic. body with
regard to future races for the King’s Cup.
An interesting one is that the starter shall
take up a position where all the crews can
see and hear him, however strong the wind
may he. Victoria contends that the State
crew was late in getting off the mark at
Hobart because it couldn’t hear the signal to
start. Another suggestion, also born of the
Hobart fiasco, is that there should be alter-
native courses in case of rough weather. The
first difficulty could be obviated by using a
small brass cannon, as at Henley, for start-
ing and finishing signals. As for alternative
courses, they arc not easy to find; moreover
rough water is regarded as one of the tests
of good oarsmanship.
"Shell” : Now that young . Barry’s chal-
lenge for the world’s sculling championship
has been accepted by Goodscll, English row-
ing enthusiasts are busy raking up the stake
and expenses, which will total £lOOO. It
seems difficult to get backers for sculling in
England nowadays, though it is never a very
hard job in Sydney. Still, £250 was planked
down at the first meeting, and there is no
fear of the match falling through for want
of funds. The Sims brothers, famous build-
ers of. racing boats, are presenting.. Barry
with a specially-built shell.

“Splash”: Under the management of
H. R. Kelly, lion. sec. of the Austra-

Moore, Ma Staters, and R. Grier and T.
Boast, Queenslanders, will leave Sydney on
July JO for a tour of Japan. Charlton, .Tones
and Stedmau were unable to make the trip.
The team cannot be called representative and
success against the strong Japanese opposi-
tion is problematical.

The game is Said to be spreading here, but
the non-representation of Queensland, West-

spasmodically in iSngland and America, the
Yanks usually scoring in the sprint and
field events and their rivals in the distance
runs. The Dark and Light Blues won at
Stamford Bridge last week by seven events
to five. The Yanks took the 100, the shot
putt, the long jump, the pole vault and (for
a wonder) the three miles. S. Carr’s pole
vault for Yale. 18 feet, is a British record.
The home side’s victories were in the 120yds.

the half.
Miss F. J. BRYAN, captain and half-back
of the English hockey team, which
has had an undefeated career in Aus-
tralia.
“Aigburth”: An English writer, in some
comment on the bowling of E. A. Macdonald,
who has already taken his hundred wickets,
asks angrily why he doesn’t return to his
methods of 1921. Mac., says the complain-
ant —a Lancashire land or A’a’l be the death
o’ a quid—doesn’t now bowl “the ball that
gets up at the batsman’s body, the ball which
gets every fast bowler most of liis wickets.”
In other words, this fine old British sports-
man demands to know why the Australian
is abstaining from trying to cave the bats-
man's ribs in, a practice which, when Mac.
and Gregory were accused of employing it
for Australia, roused all line old British
sportsmen to paroxysms of virtuous indig-
nation.
“Don Crew”: Any three-card man who
knows his business can puzzle the shrewdest
goose in the land by a fair manipulation
of the cards. But at times the goose shows
some reluctance to bite, and then the buttoner
gets to work perhaps by giving the goose
what is known as the “blind peep.” The
card man’s eyes wander for a second or
two while he lights a cigarette ; the buttoner
bends down swiftly, lifts a card the
fraction of an inch and peeps under. “It’s
the jack,” he whispers; though it isn't, of
course. If the goose doesn't nibble the but-
toner gives him the “full yelp,” also during
a temporary lapse on the part of the card
manipulator. The buttoner turns up two
cards, neither of which is tin- jack, hurriedly
replacing them before the chief looks round.
The idea is that the goose will conclude
that the remaining card is the jack. It
isn't, as the jack is not there, being smoked
away in the card man’s pocket. That is
what is known as “the smoked broad.” It
is seldom in evidence these days, having
practically outlived its usefulness.

“Blade Sight”: The accuracy of modern
rifles has just received a great advertise-
ment at Bisley. Of 909 men and one woman
shooting for the King's Prize, which went
to Captain Vernon, a “quack,” 100 scored
the possible at 500 yards. The bulls-eyes
were shot out of the canvas targets, markers
complaining that it became impossible to see
if the bull had been hit or not. Further
reduction in the size of the bulls-eye will
be necessary at future National It.A. events,
and Australia will probably follow suit. The
small calibre, flat-trajectory modern rifle is
easy to shoot straight with by those used
to older makes, with their curved trajectory
at short ranges, once the shooters master
the idea of sighting to orders In the days
of the South African War. many a bush
recruit who fancied himself with the old
Winchester found himself at sea with the
Lee-Metford. They couldn’t get out of the
habit of sighting “fine” to allow for the
upward throw, and training them to the
top -o’-the-blade-level-wi tli-tli e-top-o’-the-back-
sight idea was often more troublesome than
teaching an absolute mug. One found the
same difficulty at longer ranges, when a
fuller foresight was instinctively taken to
allow for the “drop” which the military
rifle’s sighting already provided for.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Chancery Lane”: A nice sense of the
proprieties was shown by an ex-liquidator
of a defunct company who gave evidence
in Vic. Supreme Court the other day regard-
ing his resignation. He had written to him-
self resigning the job, but the letter got
lost in the post, and he admitted doubts as
to whether he had sufficiently informed him-
self of the step he had taken.

“Avon” : A municipal trading concern that
sits on velvet is the electrical department
of Christchurch (M.L.). Last year it paid
all expenses, spent over £50,000 on replace-
ments and extensions, and showed a profit
of £24,000. Reserve funds, including a sub-
stantial sinking fund for loan repayments,
totalled £420,000. Explanation is simple:
A competent manager who is not interfered
with.
* ❖ * *
“Gregor” : Illicitly distilled spirits are still
finding their way into Sydney. The stull
comes mostly from the hills around Broken
Bay, a practically raid-proof locality. Un-
matured and unrefined, with an alcoholic
strength of 00 per cent, and over, it can be
bought for about £1 a gallon, so there is a
substantial profit in it. But it doesn’t make
the underworld any safer for democracy.
* * * *
“Guy May” : Replying to the toast of “Par-
liament” at a dinner given by the Melbourne
publicans to the Lud Mayor, Premier Hogan
rose to airy heights of eloquence on the sub-
ject of Australian industry. “It is not only
the duty of Ministry and people to uphold the
principle of preference to Australian goods,
He said, “but where it is impossible to get
them we should do without them.” (Pro
longed applause.) Then they honored the
toast in French champagne.
* * * *
“.T. Cow”:. Never before has Australia had
to go outside the Empire to have ships built,
but the thing is becoming common. The Adel-
aide S.S. Co., the North Coast Co., Burns.
Philp and Coal-baron Brown have all placed
orders for motor-ships with a famous dock-
yard in Copenhagen. John Bull himself has
had to go to Germany for some of his Diesel-
engined bulwarks. Even the Union S.S. Co.'s
Aorangi is not all British, as some of the
essential parts of her four engines were made
in Switzerland.
* * ' * sit
“H.II”: N.S.W, alone had 153,085 motor
vehicles running about at the end of 1920,
being an increase of 113,000 in six years.
They represented 311 million pounds of the
State’s cash and promissory notes. And in
1926 the United States and Mexico, which
produce four-fifths of the world’s petroleum
output, both showed a decline. Certain small
producers improved a little, and the world's
oil crop remained about stationary; but
then the motor-car isn't stationary, nor is
the oil-burning ship. The Yank, therefore,
now bores assiduously for oil instead of
expecting Providence to throw it at him.
“S.G.”: I went into a shop at Neutral
Bay (N.S.W.) to get some rice. “It was
grown in Australia,” said the shopkeeper as
lie put up the small order; and he was
obviously glad and proud to say it. Looking
round his shelves I saw Australian-made
goods where imported stuff usually meets the
eye—baked beans from Melbourne instead of
Chicago, breakfast foods from Sydney instead
of Battle Creek, and so on. Here was a
man obviously doing his best to help his
country’s industries. If the same spirit were
general in the shopkeeping world how much
more prosperous Australia would be! One
still encounters in Sydney the old silly pre-
judice against Victorian goods, and I suppose
the same imbecile provincialism lingers in
Melbourne.
* * *
“H.P.0.”: Reported that a co. is being
formed in Sydney to exploit the oil derived
from the Huon pine-tree, which grows on
the West Coast of Tasmania. It is not a
co. that is required but a market; £lOO
would suffice for a plant. After experiments
extending over many years a still was put
up in 1924 by Dr. W. A. Harrison and
Hartwell Cornier, sometime State mining
engineer. Dr. Harrison found the oil to be
about the cheapest and best form of non-
poisonous antiseptic, and especially useful
in the case of pyorrhea. One trouble is
that nothing can be patented or protected.
The distillation process is simple and cheap;
sawdust is the best material and the yield
is over 3 per cent. The product is a com-
pound of methyl eugenol with a little
eugenol. Eugenol is valuable since it can
be converted to vanillin, but the methyl
compound so far has not proved valuable
in bulk. If it can be converted to eugenol
or some other useful product, or if a regular
demand of any character is established, a
distilling plant will be the adjunct of every
little sawmill in Stralian.

A litany to the glory of the Red Cross was
intoned in the daylight coldness of the Aus-
tralia ball-room one early afternoon last
week. The Red Cross wants still more
funds, and the idea is to enrol the whole
community as members of what Mrs. It. R.
8. MacKinnon in the only inspired speech
of the afternoon described as “the most
magnificent army that has ever marched
across the world.” You can pay anything
from Is. to £lOO for your membership, and
the industrious Y.A.’s have already sent out
20,000 letters inviting membership. (So now
the postman knows whom to blame.) Dewar’s
whisky drops £lOOO into the hat, and one
other generous soul has sent in £lOO. The
constant need for money lies, of course, in
the upkeep of the society’s four' large hos-
pitals : Bodington, Graythwaite, Exeter,
Malahide, the first and the last devoted to
T.B. Lady de Chair presided over the packed
meeting, to which Russell Sinclair and
Mayor Mostyn cried out in loud voices, and
Miss Consett Stephen whispered in 'the
tones of one whose vocal cords are fin the grip
of laryngitis.
The fall and rise of the franc as much as
the fall of the Bastille occupied the speech
of Consul-General Nettement on France’s
National Day. Also at the Millions Club
lie stressed the fundamental difference be-
tween the revolutions of France and Russia.
But one wonders whether the difference
seems clear to the Shades of the little Czarina
and Marie Antoinette? However, the
triumph of that long past and gone Four-
teenth was lived again in the speeches at
the French community’s banquet at Sargent’s
in Market-street, and in the gay dance that
followed the serious speechmaking.
The crowd which gave its blessing to the
Empire Theatre’s second offering, “The
Student Prince,” on Saturday night showed
that the fact of Algernon being able to
take Ermyntrude to the best seats on normal
nights at a cost of only a little more than
half a guinea has not prejudiced the place
socially. Practically everybody one expects
to see on a big first night was there, with
more—a remarkable mixture of sporting,
artistic and musical people. The State
Excellency sat out the show with enjoyment,
even to the speechmaking of Rufe Naylor,
in which, describing the merits of the mem-
bers of his co., he drew on the language of
the movie ads. Hugh Ward—who “retired
from the theatrical business” —was in evi-
dence, too, looking as if he had a personal
interest in the show.
Just as this Letter is being squeezed into
its pink romper the Girl in the Flat Opposite
pops her head in to tell of the music and
champagne-cup she has been imbibing at
Government House. The big guns of the
affair were Prince Purachatra of Siam,
whose country is so generous to the tin-
dredging companies of Australian origin, and
Priminister Bruce. The Girl wasn’t sure
whether the Prince wore Siamese twins or
plus fours, but said Bruce had exchanged
the spats of an aimless life for a Man on
the Box Seat look.
The Prince, a brother of the King, was
educated at Harrow and Cambridge. He
qualified as an engineer, has fostered the
development of railways in his country and
. has instituted an air service.
Commem. wasn't in it with the joy of the
Undergrads’ Ball at the Palais on Friday
night. A week before the event you couldn’t
get a loge, and a big proportion of the youth
and beauty that packed the Palais had to
stand. The Governor and Lady de Chair,
accompanied by Elaine, smiled approvingly
on embryo professors and ologists who looked
anything but highbrows, the boys with Dick-
ensian side-levers and the girls in their pretty
abbreviated frocks. President C. R. Laverty
conducted vice-royalty to the blue-and-goki-
ribboned box where Howard Saxby’s bride
gave Lady de Chair a bouquet of violets and
wattle. Elaine was handed fragrant sweet
peas. Chancellor Cullen brought daughter
Ailsa in a golden lace frock and Vice-Chan-
cellor Street was also among the blithe and
free. Reseda-green georgette and gold-
embroidered net, with orchids nestling on the
left shoulder, were the vice-reine’s trappings,
while Elaine smiled over frilled powder-blue
georgette. Brig.-General Mackay introduced
a military flavor. His lady was all a-glitter
with diamente and crystals from a cyclamen
setting. Halse Rogers brought a wife stately
in rose and silver. The Maitland lady, so
seldom seen at social functions these days,
was in a black almost slieath-like robe, glist-
ening back and front with crystal sparks.
Mrs. Muscio represented the Women’s Union
in a gown of dove-grey and silver, Phyllis
Ryan the women evening students, Wilga
Moore the women undergrads’ association,
Herries Forth Sancta Sophia, J. E. Wiseman
Wesley, B. Harbison St. Andrew’s and W.
Coop St. John’s.
Early last week Victoria Barracks’ vet-
eran Lt.-Col. Bruggy rallied the Second
Division to one of -its most successful storm-.,
ings of the citadel of Jazz. There was a
splendid roll-up of the die-hards of the per-
manent forces, and the final burnish was
given to the Wentworth ballroom when both
the G.-G. and the State Ex., with their
ladies, stepped with martial tread and roll
of drums to their decorated and cushioned
possy. Lady Stonehaven’s black chiffons
leaned to the picturesque rather than the
ultra-smart, while Sir Dudley’s wife clung
to misty greens splashed with sun-rays.
General Bennett’s C. 0., whose tawny and
orange brocades suggested a summer even-
ing Out West, was armed by Lord Stone-
haven, to the supper sandwich; while the
General saw that Lady Stonehaven was not
overlooked at the feast. Lady dnChair and
Mrs. Robins swapped husbands Mr the food
interlude. The Herrings and Lloyds, Hol-
lands and Chapmans, not to speak of Elaine
de Chair in lilac and silver, were a few
of those who glittered in a crowded night
It is a pretty custom at the Catholic Ball
for the debs, to step forward to the strains
of “Advance, Australia Fair.” At the
Seventh ball, at the Moore Park Palais last
week, your real Australian tingled with
pride when to the stirring air 45 pretty
youngsters fluttered up and were presented
to Archbishop Kelly. The names which were
murmured by a foursome of attractive
matrons sounded like the family tree of the
kings of Ireland, and Brian Boru himself
might have been proud of such fragrant
descendants. The Mayoral Mostyns were
at the party, she in rose georgettes. The
frocking was rich but not so rare as to
embarrass his Grace, whose ametliyst robes
toned in with the ruby lights of the high
dome and the ruby velvets worn by the
maids of the orchestra.
As an imaginative youngster Jack Abbott
strolled by the Parramatta River in the
grey and crimson of the King’s; uniform,
and only his pen could do justice to the
memories that cling to the functions of the
old school, now in its 95th year. But Jack,
through long association with Governor Mac-
quarie and his “dear Sophy,” knows more
about a Minuet than a Charleston, so he
didn’t go to the annual dance of the Old
Boys’ Union at the Ambassadors. Anyway,
it was largely a old-boys’ and present-
day students’ hop, presided over by popular
headmaster Morgan Baker and his lady, she
very attractive in silver brocades. The blue
and white swung in brave hoops between
the pillars of the ballroom, and the school
flag floated over the stairway to the Palm
Court. President of the Union S. J. Boydell
and Mrs. Boydell smiled over a round table
of guests, representing the Old Boys of
Scots and “Joey’s,” High and Grammar,
Newington and Riverview. Among the
dancers Nell Coberoft in a sort of peaches
and cream drew many an eye. Susan Spencer
and Meg Coyie were among the night’s best
decorations; and Lucy Andreas looked like
a stretch of coral strand in her glittering
georgettes.
Mothers and babies of Australia, say how
do you do to your very good friend, Dr.
Watson Munro. Retired now from practis-
ing his pro-
fession, he is
devoting all
his thoughts
and his im-
mense know-
ledge to get-
ting a better
deal for the
unborn citizen.
This country,
with, he
avers, the best
climate, the
best conditions
and the best
food fpr the
about - to - be
mother, yet
numbers its
infant mor-
tality at over
10,000 a year.
If there were
means of get-
ting the figures of still births, that already
appalling total would probably reach over
12.000. What are we to do about it? “If
the fruit of a tree is poor, do we blame the
fruit?” asks the vivid little man. “Do
we not rather look to the tree?” More care
of the expectant mother, and more training
of her in the greatest of all duties, mother-
craft, is the gospel the doctor preaches with-
out ceasing.
Is his to be as the voice of John crying
in the wilderness, or in a country where
there are more women voters than men, are
we going to demand the Ministry for Mother-
hood that the Doctor insists is our right?
A woman must hold this appointment. Pre-
ferably a woman who has been a mother.
She must be the head of all motherhood
institutions in the State, from the School
of Midwifery at the Uni. to the smallest
clinic where the expectant mother is given
advice. She must know and approve of
the works of each institution, and without
her approval the Government purse-strings
should remain tied.
Dr. Munro, then a very young man, helped
to found the first women’s hospital in Syd-
ney. It was started in a terrace house,
rental 14s. a week, and it was almost oppo-
site the present site of the Hotel Sydney.
This hospital grew and grew, and then it
moved to Crown-street, where it still grows
and grows.
Here is the most recent picture of Frances
Alda, who has reigned Queen of Song at
the Metropolitan Opera House, New York,
for a length
of time only
granted b y
the capricious
public to a
prima donna
who has charm
as well as
voice and
method. That
she had charm
even in her
early ’teens is
remembered by
Sydney Tivoli-
goers of the
old days: the
youngster from
Maoriland was
picked as a
winner, and
racing men
named horses
after h e r
Rupert Clarke
had a famous F.J.A. Ambition took her to
New York, and by pluck and divine singing
she reached the head line at the Metropolitan.
Romance, too, found her there, for Gatti-
Cazazza, the director, persuaded her that
she could be as much a prima donna married
as single. For the first time since she left
Australia, Frances returns next month for a
concert tour, and the first of the series is
dated for the lltli in Sydney Town Hall.
Gatti, a man of imagination, at the wed-
ding feast, gave his Australian bride a pretty
surprise, and incidentally started a fashion
that prevailed in New York for quite a
while. When Alda pressed the knife into
the summit of the sparkling bridal cake,
behold it swung apart, and out fluttered two
speckless doves!
The bursary fund of St. Pat.’s at Goulburn
will benefit by the ball organised by its
Old Boys’ Union. The Ambassadors housed
the flutter, which was handsome as to frock-
ing and glittering as to jewels. The hand
of man only was visible in the arrangements,
and as a word of encouragement helps on
the meeker sex it may be murmured that
they were admirable. ,T. S. McAuliffe was
president of the committee and E. Stinson
the secretary, while friends Denning and
Reed kept the coffers—-and that’s got nothing
to do with a corkscrew.
Sancta Sophia staged a dance the other
evening and frilled itself in red, white and
gold streamers for the glad occasion. Mark
Sheldon’s lady played hostess in beaded
black, and at her right and left hands stood
Miss Egan and Miss Ilerries Forth, the
latter the scholastic don of this newest col-
lege within the Uni.
The R.A.F., of which Squadron-leader
Lukis is O.C. at Richmond, and the Rand-
wick Experimental Station, with Squadron-
leader Wackett as chief, combined to make
the hop in Victoria Barracks Garrison Hall
a brilliant splash of color—from empyrean
blue to the shade of a thunder-cloud. Mrs.
Mostyn, in cherry velvet; Mrs. Mulroney.
in sapphire blue; Mrs. Lukis, in the blue-
green of an opal; Amy Bruggy, in the flame
color of a Sydney winter sunset, were in-
cluded in a big gathering.
The quaint animal the wyvern, which looks
as though it might have been the plaything
of the humorous witch in “Macbeth,” flour-
ished a friendly paw to all and sundry at
the Newingtonians’ dance the other night.
He caracoled about the balcony of the
Wentworth while below the young Old Boys
of the college gambolled with the muscular
energy and the elasticity of early youth. It
was a non-stop party from beginning to end,
and the saxophonist held a worried thought
of death by drowning during many a treble
encore of the dance. Youths with shining
morning face and slicked back hair engi-
neered the fun, and of these the most active
was Scott Fletcher, who saw to it that
impressive lists of the Mighty were handed
to the Press. W. H. Cadogan, W. 11. Wil-
son and G. Clarke were others who bore the
white man’s burden. The table at which the
presidential Arthur Abbotts sat was massed
with crimson roses and carnations, from
which radiated black streamers to the guests'
name-cards. Mrs. Abbott’s dress was sheer
charm worked in black sequins and chiffons.
Ambassadors of colleges on both sides of the
Harbor sat at the president’s table, and
altogether the night was one or the gladdest
in the Wentworth’s week. The gate-money
goes to keep up the school’s playing-fields.
Blonde and brunette belles and cockle-
shells and cowslips all in a row will greet the
guests at the cabaret in aid of the Royal
Life Saving Society at the Ambassadors on
the sth of August. “The Mary, Mary, Quite
Contrary” girls are to be a feature of the
afternoon.
Last summer this Letter made an appeal
for a campaign against the waterhole —
especially the disused brick-works pit—and
a plea for more swimming baths in suburban
places. Last week the old brick pit took
toll once more, and three small boys were
the sacrifice.
A little over a year ago this Letter
-chronicled the rush of the descendants of
Mrs. Alexander Giffin to get to Cronulla
and the old lady’s 100th birthday party; on
.her way towards her 102nd she died the other
day. The descendants were 175 when the
first mention was made; and a few great-
great-grandchildren have been added since.
Till her husband died 13 years ago she had
lived in the Molong district. She could re-
member seeing the body of William IV. lying
in state—and that, of course, was back
before Good Queen Victoria’s day.
At Rawson Chambers on Saturday nights
members of the Workers’ Education Asso-
ciation hold their revels; and the walls of
their dance-room are not lined with gold leaf
U ut with the golden thoughts of the literary
minds of all ages and climes. And poetry
and music are fitted in between jazz.
Romance, too, looks in—one couple who had
met in the classes and studied the classics
together came to the party the other night
with the choicest first edition of all —a bonny
baby.
The pretty Maoriland girl Marie Ney, who
got her grounding with Allan Wilkie, has
found her niche in London, where a success-
ful lead has come her way; but although
the theatrical path is rosy before her, she
is leaving it at the usual call. Directly her
present engagement is at an end she will
hurry back to Maoriland to set the wedding-
bells chiming for herself and Maurice Brown-
lee, who was one of the All Black footballers.
Frank O’Rourke, the Rugby player who
goes to England by the Moldavia to join
the Leeds club, is taking a pretty bride
with him. He secured her the other morn-
ing at St. Mary’s, with the help of Father
O’Donnell. She was Mary Dunwortli, of
Neutral Bay, and she said her vows in
Limerick lace and white georgettes splashed
with silver. Frank’s contract sounds as good
almost as a movie star’s. It includes a
signing on fee of over £BOO, a fee for each
match, return fares to Australia and a posi-
tion as school-teacher.
Maudie McLachlan, of Randwick, arrived
at St. Jude’s one morning last week with
intent to become the wife of Alan Friedman,
lately of Newhaven, U.S.A. She wore misty
greys and carried pink roses to the rendez-
vous, and Canon Cakebread was the vow-
recorder. Two maids in delphinium-blue and
rose-pink followed the bride, and later the
toasts were drunk at Baris House.
Queenslanders unfolded themselves from
snug wraps in the concert-liall of the Col-
onial Institute on a recent frosty night and
listened to slim Jeanette Ethelstbn, whose
limpid notes were hailed with enthusiastic
bokays. The Girl from Mackay was wrest-
ling with a fierce bout of ’flu, but more
than justified Melba’s belief in her fresh
soprano voice. Director Nally, of the
Queensland Bureau, organised the invitation
affair by way of prelude to a big farewell
concert in the spring.
The Players’ Club presented a somewhat
shingled Shavian bill to its admirers last
week. Shaw is a dramatist who depends
perhaps more than any of his contemporaries
on voice inflections, and the actor and acto-
rines in this cast were saving of their into-
nations. Herbert Hayward, /who was the
clerk in “Augustus Does His Bit,” Vera
Keogh in “How He Lied to Her Husband,
and Geoff Rex as the absurd Lord Augustus
approached a closer understanding of the
brilliant G.B.S. than the remainder of the
persons in the drama.
Sydney music-lovers will be pleased to
learn that violinist Phyllis Macdonald, now
in London, received over £135 from her testi-
monial concert held two or three months ago.
To George Portus, concert-manager tor
Beale’s, the success is mainly due. He
wangled programmes and pianos and stage
decorations and artists and ushers, so that
except for the rent of the Conservatorium the
expenses were nothing at all. The last item,
too, was more than met by a quick-fire adver-
tising act on the part of the dynamic secre-
tary, Alice O’Donnell.

Geelong’s winter carnival included as its
time-honored principal feature the Waterloo
Cup, which carries the biggest prize in the
world for a coursing fixture. But there
was a day for the gee-gees, too, and it
brought along a record attendance. The
weather was just pleasantly chilly, and the
course looked fresh and green. The G.R.C.
committee had a billy-boiling in the planta-
tion after the Steeplechase, and there was
a big muster of social lions and lionesses. The
plantation is timbered ■with, tea-tree and wattle
tall in bloom just now), and a picturesque
thatched shelter serves as a tea-house. Presi-
dent Vincent and his wife did the honors,
she wearing navy blue with latticed inter-
ludes to show a deep petunia slip beneath.
Her millinery was of black velvet. Their
daughter Sammy was suited in mole gabar-
dine, the coat having revers of gold and
brown striped silk, with a beige felt hat to
complete the picture. Mrs. Esmond Lillies
wore a shaded grey fur coat, touched up with
ceiling-wax-red leather and a crimson beret.
Mrs. Geoffrey Strachan topped a tweed tail-
ored suit with a heliotrope hat.
The shepherd kings of the district were
represented by Mrs. jack Morrison, of Wool-
brook, Mrs, E. E. McKellar, whose nutria
fur coat was allied to black velvet millinery ;
and Mrs. Mclntyre, of Mountside, Winchel-
sea. Katharine McKellar was a trim maiden
in tweeds, with a red hat. Hilda Smytlie,
of Deniliquin, chose a natural kasha coat
frock, cheered with quiltings and pleatings
of scarlet. Golf champion Elsa Betheras,
Lorna Cox, Betty Anderson, Jean Mclntyre
and Mary Bostock, daughters of broad-acred
parents, were there. Mrs. Ramsay Cook was
one of the townies, and looked attractive with
a black felt hat above a black corded silk
coat that revealed a navy blue gown.
Mayoress Solomon, of Geelong, added white
furs to a navy frock and black liat. Mrs.
Tom Hawkes was in a fur coat and a beige
felt hat. An original addition to a natural
kasha coat was a collar of parrot’s-breast
feathers. A freakish frock had a long bodice
of deep lilac hue above a skirt of grey fur.
Mrs. D. Ashley was one of many who found
trim tweed tailor-mades suited to the
weather and the occasion.
The second day of the Waterloo Cup meet-
ing at Geelong was cold and drear at the
start, but after luncheon things brightened
and the sun endeavored to dry the well-
soaked lawns. Attendancee was below the
usual, and feminine apparel was chiefly of
the wet-day order. President Guthrie and
the committee entertained a large assemblage
hincli. Mrs. Guthrie was there with a
red hat topping a fur-trimmed black coat.
Secretary Smith’s wife was trimly clad in a
grey tweed suit, with a beige felt hat. Vice-
president Pacey’s daughter was also in the
committee pen during the afternoon. Mrs.
Ormond Foster, of Boisdale, Maffra, a dog-
owner, looked smart in a cherry-red jumper
with black and white plaid skirt and crimson
hat. Dr. Allan Stewart’s wife wore a natu-
ral kasha frock beneath a tan leather motor-
coat, brown and blue wings appearing on a
biscuit-toned hat. Betty Salmon was an out-
standing, figure in brown and fawn check suit
and red beret. The J. H. Cochranes were
there with their daughter Jean. Herbert
Austin was accompanied by his son and
daughter-in-law, the Harold Austin couple,
who have recently sold their pasturage at
Stawell and are residing at Barwon Heads
for the moment. The James Robertsons,
Mrs. Harry Anderson, Mrs. 11. Nash, owner
of the fleet-footed Red Sea, Dr. George Darby
and his wife and Alice Hyde also were
amongst those who went to the dogs. Visitors
from Melbourne included the Esmonde Sliiels
couple, she in a mink coat and petunia-pink
felt hat.
The ladies’ croquet and tennis flocks gave
a dance at the Corio Club during Waterloo
Cup week at Geelong. Yellow roses tumbled
from hanging baskets to link-up with gar-
lands of the same blooms. Mayoress Solomon
wore gold lame with a shadow of pink; Mrs.
Ormond Foster wore her favorite flame hue-
in georgette; the pretty Esmonde Sliiels
matron brightened a black frock with a
touch of blue; Newton Lees’s life-partner
glimmered in silver and blue; Beryl Gum-
ming bloomed in a poppy-toned frock with
a gleam of silver and Patty Wilson was
another fancier of red, with embroidery of
gold. General Blarney, the Stanley Mc-
Millans of Inverleigh and the Sidney Smith
couple were jazzers.
All was fresh and green at Caulfield race-
course on Saturday afternoon. The day was
sunny, with a tang in the air that fore-
boded a frost the morrow’s morn. There
was a goodly throng, but the dressing was
only a repetition of the winter garb that
has done service at all outdoor entertain-
ments these two months past. Governor
and Lady Somers went out before lunch, and
invited some members of the committee and
their womenfolk to share a midday snack
with them. Her Ex., who wore a reseda
green georgette gown beneath a grey check
tweed coat, with fawn millinery, left after
the second race to attend the children’s
dance at St. Kilda Town Hall. Mrs. E. M.
Pearce displayed something new in coats,
a black garment latticed with narrow mili-
tary braid. Her hat, velvet trimmed, was of
magenta-hued velour. Mrs. James Grice was
there with her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Claude
Grice. Mrs. Clive Baillieu looked well in
an all-black turn-out. Mrs. Merson Cooper
and Mrs. W. W. Irving displayed some fine
furs. Judge Drake-Brockman and his wife,
Mrs. Embling and her daughter Lorna,
Mavis Curtis, Mrs. T. A. Tabart and Pixie,
Mrs. Ben Chaffey and Jascha Heifetz were
there.
The S.P.A. and the Dogs’ Home bene-
fited as the result of a children’s party at
the St. Kilda Town Hall on Saturday after-
noon. Hundreds of children, ranging from
infancy to adolescence, frolicked around in
fancy costumes. The wee ones looked the
cutest, especially the toy soldiers. There
was a fairy tree, a sparkle of colored elec-
tric globes with lots of nice gifts dangling
from its tall branches, and an abundance of
balloons. The Governor’s lady took tickets
for part of the time at the refreshment-room
door. _ The monetary return should be sub-
stantial, for great trade was done at the
cake, flower and novelty stalls and the
tickets, which cost five bob, paid for nothing
but admission. National Gallery students
repeated the animal parade of their recent
ball, to the great delight of the youngsters-
Bell-ringers, 3LO, and the Foot-Warmers’
Band took a hand with the entertaining, too.
Judging the costumes was a difficult busi-
ness, but the decisions were accepted as fair.
Lady Somers, whose small, fair-haired daugh-
ter Elizabeth was a white-and-silver fairy,
handed out the prizes. Col. Davidson’s
two children and Rear-Admiral Napier's
daughter came as brigands. Diana and
Cynthia, the little daughters of Mrs. Henry
Jowett, were the most charming pair in the
room, dressed alike in hooped white satin
and frilled frocks and bonnets of early-
Victorian period. The Harry Gulletts’ girlie
Susan also affected a hooped skirt in orange
and dull red as the Infanta Margarita. The
stage-managers of the party included the
Norman Brookes couple, who brought their
daughters; Mrs. Lort Smith and her
sister, Marion Montgomery; Mrs. Richard
Linton, whose youngest son was at the jollo ;
Mrs. Gilruth and her daughter, and a host
of other people who have been energetic
Workers for the cause.
Holding his first one-man show this month
is artist Edgar Finlay, pictured here by
a Lafayette camera. Senator Guthrie, who
first met the
painter when
he was engaged
upon a picture
of “The Cruci-
fixion” for the
Lutheran
Church at Jep-
arit, is to
give the exhi-
bition its open-
ing blessing at
the Athenaeum
gallery on
Monday after-
noon. Having
faith in the
young man's
work, the Sen-
ator purchased
some of his
canvases and
encouraged the
present di s-
play. Mr. Fin-
lay, who got liis initial training at the
National Gallery, later linked up with the
Meldrum school. He is a fine colorist,
with a leaning to modernism.
For the golf dance at Ranelagh Club-house
on Saturday, night the ball-room blossomed
with jonquils and wattle, and about a hundred
took the floor. The Jack McComas couple and
the Ivan Gutmanns gave a preliminary din-
ner-party, 32 drawing up their chairs to
tables garnished with bowls of wattle, crys-
tal jars of Japanese irises tied with autumn-
tinted tulle and a sprinkling of violets and
camellias. Mrs. McComas wore evening coat
and frock of flame tone, and delicate lilae-
hued raiment, skirted with fringe, was the
fancy of the otjier hostess. Seen among the
trippers were Mrs. Norman MacPhail, Mrs.
St. John Hughes and her daughter, the W.
Mortill couple, who were accompanied by
Evelyn Moore from Sydney, Cora Spowers,
with a sparkle of silver upon an apricot-pink
robe, Nancy Scarlett, General Blarney and
the Norman Trenerys.
Alliance Frangaise celebrated the Gallic
national day at the Wattle Path Palais, St.
Kilda, with a hop de luxe. Ribbon wristlets
of the colors were passed to fair dancers,
and rosettes were displayed on the coat
lapels of their partners. Consul Rene Turck
and Madame, she in soft pink with em-
broidery of silver beads and crystal, made
entrance to the strains of the Marseillaise,
and eight other consuls and their consorts
joined the procession. Minette, the tall,
pretty daughter of the Turck couple, was in
shaded pink flounces attached to a long
bodice of bois-de-rose silk, with a turban-
like headpiece of matching hue. Mrs. Garrels
wore black, brightened by diamente. The
little Chinese lady, Mrs. Ouee, was all in
rose pink, and Dr. Busing’s wife chose a
simple ninon frock a few tones brighter.
Donna Grossardi’s Titian hair appeared above
a robe of black, decorated with seismological
shivers in gold lines and emerald sequins.
The daintiest of French confections of fox-
glove shade, with a border in beaded floral
design, was displayed by Madame Mortill.
Mrs. Cockerton, who is a keen worker for
the Alliance, wore a black gown with a great
deal of scintillation. Hester Adamson halted
the eye in her pale green frock, witli inter-
ruptions of gold. Mrs. Corrie Gardner, Dr.
Sclialit and his wife, the Ivan Gutmanns,
the J. A. Corniolcy couple and Lilian Gay
were dancers. The Farandole was the final
item of a programme interluded with exhibi-
tion dancing.
A candidate for election as municipal re-
presentative of Queen’s Ward, South Mel-
bourne, is Mrs. Britomarte James, pictured
here by Dickinson-Monteath. She has a ere-
ditable record
of usefulness
in movements
associated
with her sex in
this State, and
during the war
was unit ad-
ministrator of
the Women’s
Army Auxili-
ary Corps in
France. She
founded the
ex - Service
Women’s Asso-
ciat i o n, of
which she is
president. The
Victorian
Women Citi-
zens’ Move-
ment, likewise
the National
Council of
Women and other affiliated bodies, is sup-
porting the lady’s candidature. The Wattle
League is a pet of hers, and she is a good
friend to talented young Australians who
aspire to fame. She began her career as a
school-teacher.
Pat Fairbairn lias decided to push on with
liis studies at Cambridge, and has persuaded
his nice sister Betty to let her flat at Ames-
bury House, to the Falkiner matron and book
herself as his companion. The pair shoulder
their suitcases at the end of this month,
going across America. They intend to climb
over the Rockies, and do a few other exciting
stunts before settling down by the Cam.
Kenneth Stewart, who lately received a
shower of letters as reward for his advisory
services at the China Tariff Conference,
found his lady in Victoria. She was Noel
Brodribb; her parents, the Kenric Brodribbs,
were numbered amongst the Elect.
The Baxter sisters, Maud and Elizabeth,
have returned after a holiday saunter about
Europe. Sister Anne is to come on when
a nest is chosen.
Katherine O’Brien, who has come to a
breathless pause in this city, will, by the
time she returns home, have seen more of
the Empire than her long roll of ancestors
ever heard, about. A scramble through
British Africa, including Kenya, was but a
preliminary. Maoriland comes next; after
which she intends going round Australia.
When home she lives at Dromoland Castle,
in County Clare, with her father, Lord Inchi-
quin.
The Rymell matron is bringing her sons
home for a holiday. The party is due this
month, and intends staying till spring bursts
into leaf. Her sister, Mrs. Riddoch, is seiz-
ing this opportunity of a family reunion.
She is coming by way of Canada, and will
join the party on their return trip.
From overseas comes news of the death
through an accident at polo of lan. son of
Captain and Mrs. Vallenge, of London. He
was a grandson of the late John Madden
and his lady, liis mother being Sylvia Mad-
dim, who was not so very long ago one of
this city’s belles.
Dudley Glass, whose songs have been sung
by visiting artists, has made a bid for fame
in the old world in a musical play based on
Locke’s “Beloved Vagabond.” Adrian Ross
is the librettist. Frederick Ran alow, the
tenor, and Lilian Davies have been engaged
for the principal parts. The new venture,
which gained the praise of Boucicault, is to
be tried in the provinces preparatory to its
London debut.
Elsa Stralia, who has her cabin-trunk
packed for Europe, was the soloist of an
all-but Wagnerian programme given by the
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at the Audi-
torium last week. The soprano herself sup-
plied the exception in Weber’s “Ocean, Thou
Mighty Monster.” She looked uncommonly
attractive with her dark bobbed hair un-
bound, wearing a draped gown of oxidised
gold brocade that trailed a few lengths oii
the stage. As she raised her voice drama-
tically in excerpts from “Tannhauser” and
“Tristan and Isolde” she toyed with some
lengthy strands of pearls. Fritz Hart, who
has taken over the body of instrumentalists
since the death of Alberto Zelman, waved
his baton for the most satisfying Wagner
performance we have heard for a long time.
Rita Coonan, the singer, and Gwen Prock-
ter, who strokes a ’cello, gave a good account
of themselves to an audience in the Assembly
Hall on Saturday night. Groups of French
and modern British songs and a few of the
older classical type were offerings of the
soprano, who looked attractive with jade-
blue cape drapery attached to a gown of
silver and blue. Miss Prockter, in a setting
of rose pink taffeta, gave the Elgar Concerto
in E Minor, the Boccherini Sonata in A
Major, and a bracket of smaller pieces of
which Popper’s “Spinning Weeel” was most
sparkling. The recitalists received many
pretty posies. Mrs. E. H. Prockter and
Mollie Turner Shaw played accompaniments
helpfully.
Past and present students of the Albert-
street Con. farewelled Margot Macgibbon at
a hop at headquarters on Friday night. Miss
Macgibbon, who has a voice as well as talent
for piano and violin, goes to England shortly
to embark on a concert career. The ball-
room walls were embellished with panels
depicting musical instruments in silhouette,
divided by pink streamers dangling from
baskets of pink heath. Beatrice Touzeau
headed the organising committee, her frock
being a sparkle of blue with a dash of
petunia pink. Secretary Phyllis Drake also
wore blue, and the guest of honor was clad
in powder-blue taffeta. Iris Turnbull, who
had charge of the finances, wore a pale
amber gown with a shimmer of crystal and
silver. The Fritz Hart couple and son Basil
were there.
Another promising student was helped on
his way with a farewell concert on Friday
by the Uni. Con. This was Lindsay Biggins,
the pianist who won the free trip abroad pre-
sented by the Orient Co. Besides playing
several solos he was heard in the A Minor
Concerto of Schumann and the Cesar
Franck Variations, with the orchestra under
the baton of Bernard Heinze. A laurel-
wreath, sundry parcels and a boomerang
were the young player’s reward. The James
Barretts, Mrs. Herbert Brookes, Philadel-
phia Robinson, of the Red Cross Society, and
Mrs. George Blanch were listeners.
The Melbourne string quartette, led by
Bernard Heinze, played Mozart in G and
Ravel in F at the Assembly Hall the other
evening. The Ravel number proved to be
a weird composition, full of strange har-
monies and unusual effects. Coming after
the suavity and classical regularity of
Mozart it was a bit harsh to the palate.
Pianist Edward Goll joined the four in the
cheerful Schumann quintette in E flat. A
large and well-pleased audience included Dr.
Maurice Macgillieuddy and his daughter,
Mrs. B. B. Barraclough, pretty Margot Ros-
enthal and Claire Brennan.
“Sunny” shone so lengthily at the Princess
on Friday night that taxis did a roaring
business with patrons who missed the last
car home. It was about 11.30 when six
performers and the producer tripped towards
the footlights to make speeches. Wyn Rich-
mond smiled over a stack of flowers, and wee
Beatrice Kay laid the foundation of a col-
lection of boomerangs. Lots of pretty even-
ing frocks, Sunny’s lovely wedding gown of
white with its silver embroidery and glimpses
of pink beneath heaps of floating tulle, and
maids’ and flower-girls’ attire of pale yellow,
with floppy hats, are features of the wardrobe.
The black and white creations of the final
scene are elaborate and graceful. Mayor
Morell, the Mayoress in evening coat of gold
tissue, and daughter Shiela looked from out
a box, opposite being the Barry Thomson
couple and Ben Fuller. General Chauvel
and his lady, Group-Captain Williams and

Governor Goodwin got back from South-

m b ht of the Repertory Society’s “Mary
, Colonel Campbell was with him,
and Professor Stable did the welcoming. Mrs.
* ’ fe /mea made a success of the name
pait, and Irene Sylvester was a sweet Beaton.
Attentive houses added to the prestige and
treasure chest of the society, which is V et
J®2 ng - , *? rs - gymes wore black velvet, a
luff and Mary Stuart head-dress in two acts,
and in the last a peacock blue.
M attle Day started with gentle showers
and on a sudden turned blue and gold.
Distressed soldiers benefit this time by the
collections. Lady Goodwin was entertained
by the league m the Country Press Cafe.
Maurice Baldwin and Mrs. Colin Campbell
received, and Mrs. W. H. Barnes and the
vice-presidents handed her Ex. a posy. The
league was established in 1912, and Daphne
Mayo was the first student to gain its Art
Scholarship. Ihe league also established the
orthopmdic ward at Rosemount, where last
year <OOO cases were treated.
France’s National Day was celebrated by
the Alliance Francaise in All Saints’ llali,
amidst flags of France, England and Aus-
tralia, with a shell-torn French standard from
Villers Brotonneux. The Goodwins came
and with them Colonel and Mrs. Campbell,
-L Comte and Comtesse de Tournouer
received, the Comtesse presenting a bunch
ot red and white roses to her Ex., who wore
coral mariette. The Comtesse was in rose
color broidered in sequins.

The League of Women Relatives of Sol-
diers and Sailors gave a party to Lady Good-
win in the Rifle Association’s rooms. Her
Ex. wore navy and fox furs. Mrs. Grierson-
Brown, in navy and mastic, and Mrs.
Mutton, in tabac brown, were hostesses.
Midst green and red and gold the archi-
tects had their ball in South Brisbane City
Hall. Palms and vases of sweet-peas did
their bit and there was a large crowd of
dancers.

June almost eclipsed April’s record for
marriages. The first was that of Captain
J. H. Newmarch of Manbulloo station to
Mary Ross-Smith, at the Anglican Church.
On the same day, at the Methodist Church,
William Pennifold, of the B.A.T. staff, linked
up with Enid Besanko, formerly of Wal-
laroo. She’s well known in musical circles.
Two days later C. J. Cashman, licensee of
the Club Hotel, gave a ring to Beryl Parer
at the R.C. Church, and on the following
Monday Fred Engel, of the B.A.T. staff,
married Jean Bruce, formerly of Adelaide.
The yearly children’s fancy-dress ball was
held at the Town Hall, which was crowded
with happy kiddies. A small Orpington
rooster held converse with a Christmas
cracker; a scarecrow and Britannia, a black
moth and a silver fairy, a swagman and
Queen of the May danced gaily together;
a small band of toy soldiers marched and
counter-marched and a Persian prince and
a Puritan found much to say to one another.
One of the small boys, Val Thompson,
had a very mixed week. On the Wednesday
he was page-of-honor at the Cashman-Parer
wedding; on the Friday he was first-prize-
winner at the fancy-dress ball; on Saturday
he was chief mourner at his father’s funeral.

Gold was the principal decorative motif
at the Astley-Finlayson wedding: ivory satin
and gold for the bride, the elder daughter
of the J. H. Finlaysons; gold in the sheaf
of autumn flowers she carried; gold and
bronze for the bridesmaids (Dorothy Fin-
layson, Barbara Reid and Mavis Carnegie) ;
gold and flame of autumn leaves in the hall
at Telowery, where guests said their con-
gratulations. It was an evening affair; the
ceremony at St. Andrew’s. Walkerville, and
the toast-drinking at the Finlaysons’ home.
It has been a week of dances—at the
Masonic Hall, where old pupils of St.
Peter’s School for Girls were hostesses; at
Brighton, where the feminine committee of
that village’s yacht club is running a series
of winter hops; at the Masonic Hall, under
the wing of the Robert Homburgs (the occa-
sion the coming of age of their second
daughter), and at the Elder Hall, where the
hosts were members of the Uni. Sports Associ-
ation. For that. Mrs. Harciis schemed the
decorations—clematis, rhododendrons, roses
and azaleas, all a-blowing as natural as life,
with streamers of cyclamen ribbon and gar-
lands of laurel to hold them in place. The
Governor and Lady Bridges were there, her
gold coat topping a French frock of crystal
and silver. There were 20 debutantes to
make their bow to them.
Nearly £4OO came from the jumble sale
organised by Mrs. Guy Makin and Mrs.
Arthur Lewis in aid of the Girls’ Club.
had been planned as a two or three days’
affair, but empty stalls at the end of the
urst day knocked that little idea on the
head.
The Cottage Homes committee struck a
proud note at its annual meeting, announcing
the completion of the hundredth home. Addi-
tions to the list this year include two built
by Mrs. J. R. Corpe and three at Glenelg
trom the David Mundy legacy.
The estate of the late Alfred Le Messurier
has been sworn at £90,000.
The Alliance Fran raise celebrated France’s
Day by a cafe dansant. President Frank
Moulden and the members were hosts and
there was dancing and singing. Phyllis
Leitch, who had some lessons from Pavlova,
was soloist in “Les Sylpliides,” and gave an
excellent account of herself.
President and Mrs. Whyte did the luncheon
and tea honors at the Hunt Club’s winter
meeting—-she in dark brown and be-furred
velvet with bois-de-rose for her hat.

Perth.
Our biggest excitement lately has been
On? visit of S. M. Bruce. The Prince of
Wales Theatre was full at the civic recep-
tion and there were luncheons galore. A
very smart one was that given by Mrs. Sin-
clair J. McGibbon, wife of the chairman of
the Consultative Council, with Mrs. Bruce
as the guest of honor.
The Priminister dedicated three stained-
glass windows in the Young Australia League
Memorial Hall on the afternoon of his arrival
in Perth. These honor the memory of those
three pioneers of Australian Federation—
John Forrest (you must forgive us for al-
ways putting him first), Barton and Deakin.
The St. John of God Free Ward Ball is
one of our big annual events, and a monster
bridge party held at the Savoy to get funds
for the expenses put 80 tables into play,
the ballroom and all other rooms being used.
i( T°. wn Clerk Bold gave an address on
“.Civic Pride” to lots of women, headed by
Mrs. C. H. E. Manning, J.P., the Queen
Bee of the Friendly Union of Soldiers’ Wives
and Mothers.
The Hospital Board had to take the
Y.A.L. hall for its annual ball, the nurses’
quarters being too small to hold this year’s
crush. Doctors and nurses, with all sorts
of officials, enjoyed the Charleston and the
Blackbottom. The Minister for Health and
Mrs. Munsie joined the throng.
Three of the Brennan girls, who have been
touring on the other side of the world for a
couple of years with their mother, and
Gretchen Hardey, of Perth, were presented
at a June Court. The Brennan quartette
is on its way home.
Our military folk enjoyed themselves at
the annual hop of the 11th Battalion. There
were colorful decorations and all the brass-
hats in the State were mobilised, including
General Hobbs and his lady.

The O’Grady has gone north for a short
holiday, in the hope of getting rid of the last
germs of ’flu.
The Midland Hunt Club had its most
successful meet of the season at Quorn Hall,
Campbell Town. The old estate belonged to
T. B. Clarke, of sporting fame, and is now
owned by his son, T. W. H. Clarke, who is
one of the world’s most eminent big-game
hunters. After the run tea was served in a
big room garnished with hundreds of mounted
heads of elks, buffaloes, rhino and bears and
various other trophies of the owner’s
prowess.
One of our most popular girls, Peggy,
second daughter of the G. S. Chapmans, has
whispered her yes to Ten Lines, son of Dr.
and Mrs. Lines. The lucky man is in Adel-
aide doing research work at the Uni.
Another just-announced promise is that of
Erica, eldest daughter of the late Major G.
A. and Mrs. Gurney, to Capt. R. B. Play-
ford, Indian Army, retired.
The Women’s Branch of the Hobart De-
velopment League had a very jolly social
evening at the Trocadero last week.' Mayor
Wignall explained the objects of the League,
and the rest of the evening was devoted to
dancing and supper.

successful dance to about 100 of the
younger set at the Imperial. The occasion
was deemed worthy of many new frocks.

not join in the big trek to Canberra next

years a. sterling general president of the
A..T.A., has resigned his Hansard job and
joined a watch-importing firm.
“Ces”: Conditions for pressmen never
were pleasant in the Spring-street talking-
shop, and since the State Parliament resumed
possession they looked like going from bad
to worse with the removal of some
of the gallery accommodation. Ten
minutes after his election, however,
Speaker Snowball told the pressmen
that he had noticed the poorness of the

mised immediate remedies.
“Kir” : Preserved in the Mitchell Library,
Sydney, is the partnership agreement under
which Robert Louis Stevenson and four
others became proprietors of the Samoan
Herald. Originally established by a young
Maoriland journalist in 1892, in opposition
to the Samoan Times, the Herald was con-
ducted by Stevenson and his friends during
the most troublesome period of Samoan his-
tory, and despite the brevity of its career did
some notable work in exposing official scan-
dals. Most of the leading articles in the
paper during the brief time that Stevenson
was part-proprietor were from his pen.

The A.J.A. has lost one of its best and
hardest-working executive officers by the re-
signation from the Federal Committee of
P. J. (Paddy) Bennett, who has established
something of a record for honorary service
to the guild. He was twice Federal presi-
dent, acted as general secretary for a term,
was two years president of the Victoria
district, and for several years a general
vice-president. He was made an honorary
life member at the last Federal Council
meeting, and holds the gold badge of the
association. Another of his records is 32
years’ service as State political roundsman
for the Melbourne Herald.
“Ike Hollar”: The S. M. Herald handed
itself a present of thousands a year, and its
lino, men a few hundreds, when it decided to
cut out the “hds. rsp. y. widow des. corres.
hon. wkg. man, v. above” form of advt. and
to insist that all words should be set out in
full. The space is estimated at six words to
a line; but as that figure is merely a guard
against long words, the S.M.H. scores a mul-
titude of bobs for unused lines in every issue.
The turnover lines give the lino, men their
harvest; in former days they were expected
to cramp that turnover into the lineage pur-
chased. Before the first journalists’ wages
tribunal, Manager W. G. Conley remarked
laconically that if the Herald contained no
news it would still be a necessity to most
people because of the small ads., and the
paper is certainly making the most of its
grip on that business.
Jack Olliver, who passed on the other day
at 52, was one of the best-liked sporting
scribes of the small Dominion. He went
into the sub.’s room of the Referee 27 years
ago, and stayed on. For the last 18 months
he acted as editor, re-establishing the jour-
nal, which had long been a supplement of
Christchurch Weekly Press, as an adjunct
to Wellington’s only morning daily, the
Dominion. Jack's health was never robust,
and the strain of the transplantation, whicti
involved him in a tremendous amount of
work and worry, left the quiet, sensitive,
intensely conscientious chap an easy. prey
to an iliness that struck him while re-visitmg
Christchurch.
“N.Q.”: There are countries where the
way of freelance writers is far harder than
in Australia. Take Central Europe. Look-
ing into a good many issues of the Neue
Freie Presse (Vienna), I can find no more
than a fraction of work done by Austrian
or even by German hands. Here is a large
issue with a literary supplement. In the
general paper, the leading and largest article
is by Lord Grey of Falloden, obviously a
syndicated translation. In the literary
section the chief dish is a chapter from
Archibald Henderson’s book on Shaw, the
serial is Galsworthy’s “Silver Spoon,’ while
a long extract from the letters of \\ alter
Rathenau fills much of the remaining space.
\ f ew reviews of English books are signed
with Austrian names; so are one or two
sketches of life in the Riviera and mens
fashions in Paris; but I doubt the writing
of those sketches would provide the authors
with funds for verifying their “impressions
on the spot. It is said that Vienna is again
producing music and that again students are
flocking to Viennese scientists. I have not
heard, though, that its writers are yet above
the breadline.

What a story his pen could tell! Since
early manhood; joys, sorrows, home and
business life have all been served by this
faithful, efficient recorder—a “Swan.”
Through legal severity and the whim-

The plot of “Old Heidelberg” has sustained
no great damage by its translation into
“The Student Prince,” which opened at the
Sydney Empire on Saturday, but 34 hours
is a bit too much of a good thing. Prince
Franz Karl, after a secluded boyhood in
which he undergoes a rigid training for liis
royal job, goes off to Heidelberg, to the
accompaniment of bright singing, full of
eager expectations of seeing something of
the lighter side of life. He is greeted, as
is inevitable in musical comedy,.by a robust
male chorus of students and, as is equally
inevitable, falls in love with Kathie. waitress
of the Three Golden Apples Inn. The young
man who has been idiotically isolated makes a
grande passion of what should be merely
an ordinary love-affair, and, reminded of his
obligation to marry a royal cousin he has
never seen, decides to give kingship the go-
by and elope with his sweetheart. Just
at this stage, however, he has to rush away
to the deathbed of his grandfather, and
later is detained by kingly cares and the
watchfulness of Ministers, who perpetually
remind him of his conjugal obligations. At
last he flies back to Kathie; but she, being
a right-minded girl, and being assured of
the Princess Margaret’s genuine love for
the king, performs the act of abnegation
expected of every stage-maiden in such cir-
cumstances. She assures her royal lover
that she has forgotten him, and is going to
marry a respectable burgher who won’t stand
to lose his livery-stable business through his
alliance with her. The music, although
there is some tendency to repetition, is of

good quality; the sugary songs are packed
with love, roses and dreams and the dances
are excellent.
Hi Hi Hi Hi
The robust 28-strong male chorus, whose
members are sometimes students and at other
times soldiers, is a full-throated delight and
the soprano and contralto part of the chorus
blends with it nicely when necessary. James
Liddy, as the Prince, unites a pleasant per-
sonality with an attractive singing voice; but
his acting is mediocre, and in his ordinary
dialogue his voice has a forced, sugary note
that makes it impossible to regard his emo-
tions as anything but stage-work. Elise
“Gergely plays Kathie daintily; she, too, has
good singing capacities, her failing being a
tendency to race in her speech till she leaves
the sense of her lines behind. A voice remi-
niscent of the days of the Real Old Actor is
provided by Hedley Hall, who manages to
make the sympathetic tutor with a bent for
dissipation a real person, but the great success
of tlie performance (outside the chorus) is the
Lutz of Dallas Welford, who extracts rich
comedy out of the pretentiousness of the
Prince’s valet. He is assisted moderately in
distilling the humor of the piece by our old
friend Bertie Wright. The Yon Mark of Bert
Barton is a rather tame creation ; Daisy Bel-
more gives some helping to the comedy as the
Grand Duchess Anastacia; Nellie Strong pre-
sents a Princess Margaret with an abundance
of good looks and a pretty wistfulness under
her dignity; Arthur Clarke is a robustly
handsome Captain Tarnitz; and Sam Stern
as Toni has a fine but slightly over-stressed
scene with the king to help him make a per-
sonal hit. The show should be popular when
it settles down into reasonable limits.
Frank Neil has done well with his revivals
of old comedy classics; it is a pity he
did not stick to them instead of turning to
such trashy American importations as “Not
To-night, Dearie.” The play is the story
of a dual elopement, one pair of lovers
being the daughter and son of the man and
woman who constitute the other double;
the elder elopers think the young people
will object to their marriage, whilst the
young ones have a similar illusion about
their parents’ attitude. Field Fisher is the
comedy success of the play as Amos Doo-
little, the proprietor of a “road house” where
“tea” with a kick in it is available; and
Amos having craftily dug a hole in the road
to wreck passing cars and bring him busi-
ness, there foregather beneath his hospitable
roof the two couples, the two-months wife
of the parson who was to marry them, the
parson himself and a theatrical lady and her
gentleman friend, an Irishman named
Ike Itosenheimer. Thereafter the humor
develops on bedroom lines, with descents
iuto the smoking-room, one slice of dialogue
being a piece of sheer indecency. On the
broad comedy side, Lily Molloy gives good
support to Field Fisher as the daughter of
Amos Doolittle. Miss Betterton Glover does
well as the parson’s wife; Frank Neil and
Mary Gannon, who is inclined to be shrieky,
and Connie Martin and Leslie Woods, who
goes around in shirt tails and underpants
in the cause of elevated humor, are the
young and old couples respectively. Vivian
Edwards plays briskly the Ike who is really
Mike; Marie le Varre is the actress who
claims him as her gentleman friend, and
Jefferson Taite is a farcical parson. This
Showman’s best wish to Frank Neil is that
he will find it advisable to make a quick
change to “Are You a Mason?” which is
already announced as the next production.
How the gold came on the butterfly’s
wing had always been a mystery to one
Bulletin scribe, but an explanation offered
itself the other night. The gold dust is the
dancing music from fairy fiddlers. A grate-
ful butterfly one day offered one of the
tribe a ride, but becoming startled just as he
reached a cabbage-patch, he let his passen-
ger drop. Everybody knows what happens to
a fairy dropped under a cabbage. This par-
ticular one became the baby Zimbalist.
“Madame Pompadour” goes her winsome way
at Sydney Her Majesty’s ; “Cradle Snatchers,”
now set for its century, continues to
stir the laughter of Palace audiences; and
“The Ghost Train,” running eerily at the
Criterion, is still a long way off its terminus.
“The Sheik” will shortly fold its tents and
steal out of the St. James, where “Lady, Be
Good!” is due on Saturday week. “Ypres”
may still be seen at the Royal, but the rumble
of Moscovitcli approaching with “The Ringer”
(which has nothing to do with shearing-
sheds) is already faintly audible. Margaret
Lawrence and Louis Bennison have arrived
in Sydney, and are busy on rehearsals of
“The Road to Rome” ; but it is not yet settled
whether this has its first showing in Sydney
or Melbourne.

A pleasant addition to the Sydney Fuller
programme is Roy Ryan, a young man from
Newcastle, who can imitate hens in a way
that could induce any poultry-farmer l to
believe that his fowls were working over-
time. The same bird mimic is just as adept
at soaring on the high wing of the lark’s
trill or whistling like a canary. The rest
of the programme is just another shuffle of
cards under the label “To The Block.”
* * * *
There is a plenitude of laughter in the
antics of the three monkeys, Max, Moritz
and Akka, who are providing the star turn
at the Sydney Tivoli. They walk tight-
ropes, indulge in boxing matches and seem
to derive as much enjoyment from extracting
roars from the audience as a star soubrettc
might do. The Big Four, who are peren-
nials, are back; another addition to the bill
is Mark Leslie, an only moderate coon im-
personator.
* * * *
In “Ypres,” the long-delayed motion-pic-
ture of the war, the fierce battles of the
famous salient are pictured at the Sydney
Royal with an extraordinary poignancy. No
attempt has been made to feature a hero, or
a bunch of such, as is the Hollywood cus-
tom ; the story that is now history is too
vast for that. It is a fine piece of grim
realism, lightened by some gleams of Eng-
lish humor, but some disappointment will be
felt by Australian audiences at the fewness
of the scenes in which the Diggers figured.
"MADAME POMPADOUR ”
AT SYDNEY
TER MAJESTY’S.
Madame Pompadour (Beppie de Vries ) and
Rene (Frank Webster).
Sydney’s little Players' Club gave two
nights of Bernard Shaw to its highbrow
patrons at St. James’s Hall last week. In
the opening piece, “The Fascinating Found-
ling,” honors went to Alice Gould for her
piquant picture of the suffragette who com-
pensates herself for her hunger-strike in gaol
by doing the round of various hash-houses
after her release. She had able supports in
Harold Frazer, James Gray and Norman
Shield. “Augustus Does His Bit” is a typical
G.B.S. tilt against the militarist; here Geof-
frey Rex entered with spirit into the part
of Lord Augustus Highcastle. Marion Michie
(the lady) and Herbert Hayward (the clerk)
supplied the necessary co-operation. The final
play, “How He Lied to Her Husband,”
was robbed of most of its effect by the absence
of the helpmate who had to be lied to—
whose part had consequently to be read —
but Vera Keogh as the wife and Clive Gop-
pard as the poetic third party managed to
put in some good work notwithstanding.
The three plays were produced by Norman
Shield, Winchester Ford and Vera Keogh;
Francis Jackson, the society’s director, who
is well known to Red Page readers, chatted
interestingly on Shaw before the curtain
went up.

Sydney King's Hall was packed to hear a
lecture by Flying-OHSper 11. Bowden Fletcher,
accompanied by a film graphically illustrating
the history of Australian aviation. The im-
portant models of Laurence Hargreaves, from
which the modern aeroplane was developed,
were depicted on the screen; and then came
pictures of the pioneers of Australian flight
—Hawker, Ross and Keith Smith, Hart,
Parer and Mclntosh, Goble, Wackett —and
their successors. The film showed all the note-
worthy incidents of our aerial annals; it
was enthusiastically received and might well
be preserved in the War Museum.
Some drawings:—
There is strong, masterful work in the drawings
of Randolph Schwabe, at the Macquarie Galleries
(Sydney) ; but they stand rather as studio examples
of How It Should Be Done than as sketches the
average art lover would want to purchase. The
studies in the nude, numbered I to XVI, are well
done; but even when labelled “Nude No. 11, Rosie
Standing,” “No. IV, Rosie Lying Down,” or “No. V,
Rosie Seated, Back View,” they seem to carry no
great appeal as home decorations. There are models
not in the nude, too, such as Alice when she is
just knitting; Birdie is another of the ladies favored
with a name. There is the same confident, sure
work, but a certain lack of imagination, in the
landscape drawings—“ Autumn” and “Cocking Mill
Pond, Sussex,” are nice. A show that the student
"should see for its draughtsmanship.

The most original thing about “Sunny,”
the new musical and millinery enterprise of
the Fullers at Melbourne Princess, is the
sixpence asked for the programme, a method
of popularising the stage that hasn’t yet
occurred to other producers. The next most
original features are the engaging clowning
of Fred Heider as a half-witted rustic type,
the delightful comedy of little Weenie Win-
ters Beatrice Kay, and the dancing of Van
Lowe, a thoroughly capable young man who
laughably contrasts a mock austerity of man-
ner with an impulsive chattiness about the
feet. Marion Martinez also dances, once
charmingly as a snowflake or something, and
later conventionally as the imperishable
Spanish miss-in-baulk: also Fred Bluett is
the competent purveyor of an entertaining
song about Ma and Pa. Otherwise the piece
ambles along the well-delined lines of Afro-
American sing-song shows, starting the jour-
ney in a circus in England and ending it in
a gymnasium in U.S.A. It is somewhat
monotonous, despite its 12 changes of venue,
and if the same lot of performers came on as
frequently in a variety theatre, they would
have the auditorium furniture thrown at
them. The attempt to present Wyn Rich-
mond, the “Sunny” of the piece, as a star
is a failure. She doesn't wring the heart,
and approximately 1000 Australian girls can
sing and dance as well. "Sunny” should be
renamed “Moony” or cut down by half its
present length. On Friday, when it started,
half the audience seemed in grave danger of
yawning their heads off. Except for a couple
of catchy airs, the music, like the dead, is
beyond praise or blame.
If pianist Isidor Achron had intercepted
half of the applause that went to violinist
Heifetz at Melbourne Auditorium on Satur-
day, after Brahms’ sonata in 1) minor sub-
sided into silence, lie would not have taken
more than his fair share. The unshakable
facial gravity of this young man is belied
by the expressiveness of his fingers when he
gets a respectable opportunity. He got it in
the above-named work with its core of tender
melody and sentiment. Heifetz’s vogue—
the back of the stage has had to be thrown
open to the populace—is a little puzzling to
this commentator. The austere artist makes
few concessions to the lighter-minded con-
cert-goer. He is quite remarkably unselfish
in permitting the great composers to have
their say per medium of his 10,000-guinea
Guarnerius without intruding his own per-
sonality. His repertoire is evenly divided
between works of a noble and satisfying pro-
fundity and displays of exasperating techni-
cal proficiency, such as Paganini’s D major
concerto, which is essentially on the same
level of artistic merit as a performance on
the tightwirc. Heifetz gave nine highly-
appreciated concerts in Melbourne and then
returned to Sydney.
Isidor Achron, who accompanies Heifetz in
his musical excursions.
Fritz Hart, in his picturesque way, has
set out with the avowed intention of making
the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra a living
memorial to its late creator and conductor,
Zelman. With his all-Wagner night at the
Auditorium last week he laid a line foun-
dation. “Tannhauser,” “Lohengrin,” “Tristan
and Isolde” and “Die Meistersingers” were
dipped into for their most popular treasures.
The orchestra’s violins never stayed more
beautifully or confidently on their long notes
than they did in the mystic “Lohengrin” pre-
lude, and the gay doings on the Venusberg.
as stated in the “Tannhauser” overture, were
described by all hands as voluptuously as the
composer intended. Elsa Stralia’s clear,
strong and belligerent soprano rendered
Elizabeth’s very hearty Greeting to the ILlll
of Song, and as Isolde the distinguished vocal-
ist died with every symptom of passionate

The Importance of the Metal Action in
WIJRuIZER
PLAYER
PIANO
With the introduction of the Wurlitzer metal action—Player Piano performance takes on an entirely
new meaning.
Wood, however carefully chosen and treated, cannot defv the influences of climatic changes—whilst the
special non-corrosive metal alloy from which the Wurlitzer metal action is made is positively uninfluenced
by the most extreme climatic conditions.
The importance of this lies in the fact that the player action is a highly sensitive piece of mechanism on
which depends the whole worth of the instrument.
The precision of “Wurlitzer” mechanism, the beauty of “Wurlitzer” tone, is a PERMANENT factor —
built on a foundation that ensures the greatest possible satisfaction.

When it doesn’t take itself too seriously
the noiseless screen can do great things.
“Mademoiselle from Armentieres,” a British
picture privately filmed at the Majestic, Mel-
bourne, last week, is as artless and absurd
and inconsequential as a Ford on three
wheels, yet so cleverly is hideous war con-
scripted in the cause of domestic sentiment
that the show would bring lumps to the
throttle of a baby farmer. The picture
brings the legendary Mademoiselle from A.
to life in the shape of a plump and arch col-
leen, only distantly French, who loves a hand-
some British soldier in the intervals of serv-
ing the drinks in an estaminet. There is the
usual low comedy behind the lines, with the
stock Prussian spy disguised as a Gallic pea-
sant and the customary humorous prepara-
tion for an attack. Finally the long arm of
coincidence is put out of joint to enable all
the principals, except a donkey, to make
their appearances together as prisoners at
the same German headquarters. Approxi-
mately 100,000 French soldiers are sacrificed
to provide the happy ending.

Melbourne Art shows :
W. D. Knox composes his pictorial poetry on a
foundation of sound technique. In his show of oils
at the Sedon Galleries, Melbourne, there are some
stunning views of the sort of hazy landscape that
house agents say would be lovely if only the day was
clear. The gliding beauty of the perspective in
“Over the Rosebud Plains” could hardly be excelled
and the critical eye could give itself a holiday if
the artist would pay a little more attention to his
foregrounds.
Most of the pictures exposed at the Women’s Art
Club at the Athen*um give the impression that the
feminine painter snatches up her brushes while
waiting for the eggs to boil. The Misses J. C. A.
Trail, A. R. Dent, Dora Wilson, Daisy Stone and
Clarice Beckett are of those who seem to have given
more time to the affair, and the lastnamed is par-
ticularly interesting. She depicts the modern world
in a modernistic manner, has a delicate eye and a
palette of pearly tones; and she has something
charming to say even about motor-cars. Miss Wilson
paints Melbourne in a distinguished manner, and her
“Kathleen” is a sharp pastel portrait. Miss Dent’s
strongly lighted picture of H. T. Schrader is boldly
modelled, hut the “Jean” of Miss Blanche Cade has
a bad smell under its nose. Miss Ena Smith has
a depressing picture of a lady with heroic arms
supporting herself on the bottom of the frame; but
her piece of statuary, a long-bodied girl just budding
into womanhood, with her weight securely laid upon
ihe hands planted on the ground behind her, is
easily the most striking exhibit in the show. Most
of the water-colors are still in the pinny stage
of Art.

The Adelaide Theatre Royal is dispensing
American comedy in “Tip Toes.” The Prince
of Wales, after staging some hair-raising
mystery in J. Jefferson’s “Haunted House
No. 13,” with a murder of which everyone
is suspected in turn, is giving Adelaide a
view of Kate Howarde’s Australian Players
in “Gum-tree Gully,” fresh from a 15 weeks’
season at the Palace, Melbourne. At
the Majestic, Wallace and Gennett are
exploiting the Blackbottom, and Gayle
Wyer’s revue company is handing out some
smart entertainment in “Band Box Brevi-
ties.” At West’s Pictures, “So This Is Paris”
features a more than usually riotous artists’
ball, and there is a clever animal act,
entitled “A Day in Dogtown.” At the
Wondergrapli Theatre “McFadden’s Flats”
is drawing packed houses, starring Charlie
Murray, as Dan McFadden, and Chester
Conklin, as Jock McTavish, and there is a
comedy film, “The Red Mill,” with Marion
Davies as a little Dutch girl. The romantic
sex is storming the York Theatre to see “It,”
Elinor Glyn’s latest love thriller.
Poverty
Point
“Curtain Raiser”: Fred Coape once took
a company to Ravenswood (Q.). The ad-
vance billing was all that could be desired,
but not a poster was to be seen. “This
looks like a conspiracy,” said Coape. “Too
right,” said the lessee of the hall, “and if
you’ll put up another placard or two I
think I can show you the villains in the
act.” Within five minutes the conspirators
arrived —two enormous billy-goats.
“The Old Adam” : Gregan McMahon, who
has not given his Repertorians a chance in an
Australian-made piece for some time, will
soon be doing a one-acter, “Gold Dust,” by
Max Murray, a Melbourne journalist. The
Sydney Rep.’s new show wall be John Drink-
water’s “Mary Stuart.”
“L. de Rideau”: A Melbourne variety
house just shaved the police court the other
day. It staged that hoary chestnut the
poker party, in which a lady loses every-
thing she has in cash and then, going behind
a screen, proceeds to pay the balance by
throwing over the shelter her clothing, bit
by bit. She is then asked if she has any-
thing left. “Only my bare skin,” she screams.
“Well, step out in that!” The plainclothes
constable detailed to report on the show
gasped and clutched the chair arms till his
knuckles shone. He went off disgustedly
to headquarters: there was nothing impeach-
able in the spectacle of a woman in a bear-
skin coat.
“Goldilocks” : Edward Larkin, who played
Touchstone in plus fours at the ’Varsity
students’ performance of “As You Like It”
at the Sydney Conservatorium, is a son of
Teddy Larkin, once M.L.A. for Willoughby,
who enlisted directly the call for soldiers
was made and died at the Gallipofi landing.
The younger Edward was a brilliant school-
boy, the pride of Riverview College; he was
ripe scholastically for the University when
he was 14, but had to wait. He has a nice
sense of humor; it was that salting of his
Touchstone representation that gave it its
flavor.
“John’s Wood” (Loud.) : The only artist
who has been able to fill the Albert Hall
on a Sunday afternoon for a long time is
Fritz Kreisler. Johann Strauss, the Viennese
“waltz king,” with an orchestra of 50 and
a programme of Strauss tliree-four time,
rather like a whole meal of chocolates, had
only a middling audience. Tom Burke, the
tenor, back in London after seven years’
absence, did rather better, but Vasa Prihoda,
the Czech violinist, and Maria Ivogun, one
of the Covent Garden stars, failed to draw.
When Kreisler played, the touts demanded
7s. 6d. for the Is. 2d. sky gallery and 15s. for
the 2s. 4d. orchestra seats.
“Caul Boy” : The
Fullers are finding
a rest - cure from
vaudeville worries
in the revue idea,
with its conven-
tional straw-hatted
hero, soubrette, co-
median and buffer-
clown a n d six
chorus-girls that
don’t chorus. Not
satisfied with hav-
ing 10 such congre-
gations cavorting
round Australasia
they are sending
Tubby Stevens, the
diminutive buffoon
with the gigantic
grin, to Perth to
form the 11th. On
his previous visit
the Groper capital
supported the Eng-
lishman’s revue
show for 42 weeks,
probably a local re-
cord. Stevens is
above the average
i n 1 o w comedians,
having command
over those still
moments which are
so much less tire-
some than the rest-
less activities of the
ordinary comic
bloke. Th e Fuller
passion for this
form of entertain-
ment may not be
high art, but it
giVes more bread
and butter to Aus-
tralians than imported shows do.
“Curtain Raiser”: Harry Hall, last of
a dynasty of actors, has taken his final
curtain at 62 in Melbourne. His father and
mother were prominent barnstormers of their
day. One of Hall’s biggest roles came in
George Rignold’s production of “Joseph of
Canaan” in Sydney in 1896, and he was
with Sweet Nell when she first staged the
Old Drury fantasy the year after.
“Lud”: According to George Tallis, now
in England, British plays are ousting Ameri-
can from the London stage and what he
calls “hectic” pieces are disappearing. .So
we shall soon say good-bye and good-riddance
to them in Australia. The Williamson direc-
tor is arranging the repertory for the next
Vanbrugh-Boucicault Australian tour; he
has acquired Harrison Owen’s comedy, “The
Happy Husband,” and Somerset Maugham’s
pieces, “The Letter” and “The Constant
Wife.” The last-named failed badly in Lon-
don, but is still coining money in America,
where it was first produced.
“Curtain Raiser”: Australia is shortly to
hear Joseph Hislop, the English operatic
tenor, who, like many another, had to be
“discovered” in Europe before his fellow-
countrymen agreed to believe their ears.
It was Stockholm that found him. In Milan
he lias warbled through 30 roles in a single
season. Melba and he chorussed together
at Covent Garden just after the war.
“Smada”: What would the pictures be
without music? Press critics have to judge
coming films in a dead silence • but the
thing seen by the public owes half its suc-
cess to the orchestra. War films, such as
“Mademoiselle from Armentieres” and “The
Big Parade,” are carried on to popularity by
the insistent playing of well-known 1914-18
songs, repeated at every exciting moment.
The right idea is featured by the Prince
Edward, Sydney, which, by stage presenta-
tions, orchestral pieces and organ accom-
paniments, provides a genuine entertainment.
“Count Drolatique”: Of all the female
Hamlets who have strutted the cardboard
battlements of Elsinore probably the slen-
derest was Sarah Bernhardt and the
plumpest Nance O’Neill. Sarah did her
moody Dane when she was as thin as a
rake, and, being photographed in costume
with a terrier posed in front, heard rippling
round the salons the comment “a dog and a
bone.” Nance O’Neill, nearly 50 when she
was induced to be or not to be in black
tights and the rest of the funereal trappings,
poured, all the Nance we used to know ami
more into the togs—made a Glaxo exhibit
indeed of Yorick’s old friend. Yet I’m
told Nance was dramatically rather striking,
demonstrating the possibility that Hamlet
might have been a woman in disguise.
“Flaming Youth”: Horace Fitzbuskin had
no intention of revisiting the district, but he
booked future show-dates in each town as
a means of leaving bills unpaid. Business
had been poor, he explained, and the co.
was unable to pay, but it would settle up
when it came back for the show-dates. Later
Horace learned that the dates were well
worth playing; but he didn’t like the notion
of paying bis creditors. So the towns were
informed that the co. had suffered an irrepar-
able loss. Horace, it was announced, was
no more, but in obedience to his last wish
the co. would carry out his contract with
the public he loved. In these pathetic cir-
cumstances, not only did many creditors
forego their bills, but there were good houses,
and subscriptions were raised for the benefit
of Horace’s widow and orphans. Nobody
suspected that the muffled, bearded man in
the ticket-box was the deceased.
“Cine Ma”: Figures that should be hor-
rible reading for the young dears who
imagine that a pretty face is a passport
to a managerial waiting-room at Hollywood
have, been published at Los Angeles. The
waiting list of prospective “stars” never
falls below 18,000; and the average number
of supers required daily in the busiest shoot-
ing season is only 710; in slack times it
drops to 50. And this in spite of the fact
that Hollywood has a bureau which meets
all trains for the specific purpose of turning
back the carloads of incipient film darlings
that descend on it from all parts of the
world. The average wage paid is less than
355. per day, and the day doesn’t come often.
Y'et almost every danse palais in this coun-
try is running a competition discovering film
stars for exportation to America!
“Smada”: One inherent difficulty in the
film version of “The Term” is the prevalence
of ziffs. The military men show clean faces,
but the hero and his mates are doomed
throughout the play to wear jungles of vege-
tation on their chivs. No flapper could wor-
ship a whiskered hero.
“Caul Boy”: They bore me, these mum-
mers who are forever asserting that if they
could have their lives over again they would
give the stage a miss. I can understand a
civil servant or a drayman doing it, but not
an actor. In my experience the histrionic
gift goes with a temperament that loves pub-
licity. It is a strange mummer who doesn’t
believe what his own press agent says about
him, or who doesn’t pity the critic who says
otherwise for being an ignoramus. Where-
fore I welcome the assertion of Marie Burke
that she loves her job and wouldn’t give it
up under any consideration. What is more,
she means to train daughter Patricia for the
stage. This is the sort of spirit in which to
meet the menace of the movies.
“The Listening-Insect”: Concerts broad-
cast from 2LO in London haven't been
received with alacrity in this country, largely
because the difference in time necessitates
getting up by candlelight to hearken to them.
There is a way of overcoming the difficulty,
however. It is possible to take an electrical
record of a song or speech which is quite as
accurate as a gramophone reproduction. A
continuous steel tape is magnetised and
demagnetised by the ether waves, and
when run through a transmitting instru-
ment sets up identical impulses which
can be despatched in the usual way.
Thus a record of a concert given in the even-
ing could be redistributed by a solitary opera-
tor at the time most suitable for reception
in Australia. Also there is no reason why
stations could not exchange programmes by
post in the same way. If Hollywood gets
hold of the idea it w r ill probably proceed to
Americanise the auditory world, as it has
done the optical.
WINTER—THE BARNSTORMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The singing troupes of summer
Are gone—it seems an age;
A ranting, tearing mummer
Still struts our southern stage,
While rolls the thunder-drummer
And the wind-fiddles rage.
A few dull lines he musters;
No sun makes golden play
On nodding wattle-clusters
To gladden the grey day,
As on he mouths and blusters
In his old-fashioned way.
Ever on us he presses
The “stark realities,”
Nor clothes their nakednesses
With scenic decencies;
In sadly threadbare dresses
Shiver the “super” trees.
And where were once romances
The lovers stray no more.
No more on nymphs one chances
Where now the frost is hoar,
And lone the lashed wave dances
Along the lonely shore.
THE ARTIST WITH AN EYE FOR COLOR!
Of cold and want and dying
He raves; his favored themes
Are hungered babes a-crying
And harsh,, bedevilled dreams;
And now he’s wildly sighing,
And now he madly screams.
The singing troupes of summer—-
They make a glam’rous show
To dazzle each newcomer....
With tinsel? Maybe so.
, But this barnstorming mummer—
I wish to God he'd go!

to Insure Quality of Tone
THE tonal excellence, the volume, the range, for which
Stromberg-Carlson “Shielded” Receivers are celebrated,
is best brought out through the use of only Stromberg-
Carlson Accessories; from pick-up device to speaker.
The power necessary to obtain the finest r ® ce P tlo f
which these instruments are capable, is best handled by
Stromberg-Carlson power supply units. This is due to the
fact that these power supply units were built solely to meet
the exacting requirements of the high quality audio system
in the Stromberg-Carlson Receivers No compromise was
attempted to permit their use with other receivers
although certain others with the same tubes similarly
arranged may enjoy the advantages of the equipment.
The use of the proper speaker is also of extreme importance in ob-
taining the best possible results from Stromberg-Carlson Receiv-
ers Only the Stromberg-Carlson Cone Speaker-with its viohn
soundboLd which gives exact rendering of each tone, semi to
and overtone—will insure the finest quality of reception.
Ask your dealer to arrange a Stromberg-Carlson
tion for you, and try it yourself.

The Harp of Desire.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
rHIS that the wind told me,
Striving to hold me
With chill, trembling hands,
Had been written far on the sea
And engraved on the sands,
But the words ivere strange to me,
Walking the green lands:
Dudli, high on his throne
Of music and fire,
Made the clouds his own
And bent their desire
To peace and good days,
( Lest the world should tire,
Going the long ways.
He twisted the thin air
In his fingers of light
As a basket to hold prayer
Day and night,
Made soft with star hair
And moon-wool white.
So still was every day
Late and soon
That a man standing in May
Heard men talking in June
And the noise of the shadow that lay
On the roadway at noon.
Never the hair of a cow was stirred
t Nor a barley head
Nor the breast-down of a bird
Nor a leaf brown and dead ;
Only the good word
Was answered and said.
But the harp of Ludh was
In a tree of fire ;
And the air was full of fret
And sharp desire
To break loose and get
Its hands on the golden wire.
The air had a soft glove
And a hand that would not wait •
And twice it strove for love
And thrice it strove for hate ;
For the trees were crossed by a dove
And a swallow went over the gate.
Ludh walked long in the west
In a cloak of flame,
And the nine stars in their nest
Whispered his name;
But the air could not rest
Like a cat stroked tame.
Up it rose in the night,
Standing higher and higher,
hands, long and light,
Shook with desire,
Till it tore in the world’s affright
The tree of fire.
Ludh came home at the shout
Of the broken sky.
In his eyes was the great doubt,
I earful and high ;
lor a tempest of shame was out
With a mad cry.
Twice was his hand on liis beard
And twice on his sword ;
For he saw his world and feared,
As the lightning gored
llie woods, like a boar speared,
And the thunder roared.
But the wind trembled and stayed
tbe sight of his face;
>' ith lifted hands it prayed
In that terrible place,
As the doom in his look delayed,
Empty of grace.
The cringing wind bent low,
"he shame on its mouth was foam ;
Eut the judgment word came slow:
Go at your will and roam
The path that the stars show
And never have rest or home!”
The tale that the wind told me,
Straining and striving to hold me,
Is written on lost sands.
Over the sorrows of lands
I lie air has a homeless cry :
“Man is my brother of tears,
With no rest in the years,
And the harp of desire is too high.'”
N.s.w.
DAVID MCKEE WEIGHT.
Marcus Aurelius.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
NOBODY in Sydney ever really knew —-
except his wife—where that magnifi-
cent ornament of the financial world
of the South Seas who controlled the
affairs of Aurelius and Company got the
gieat. name under which he prospered so
materially in life and bequeathed as a mem-
ory of emulation to posterity. In the ’thir-
ties and ’forties of the last century it was
a name to conjure with throughout Aus-
tralasia and Polynesia—one that stood for
Success, Solvency, Solidity and Substance.
Governors revered it, the Colonial Office in
Downing-street honored it, shareholders
gloried in it, and the common run of man-
kind so loved and respected it that they
revelled in its mere utterance.
Only poor, thin, unhappy little Mrs. Aurel-
U 1S ’ I l ] l \, th , e da -V when she departed from' a
wor d that had become all too magnificent
to be endured longer, remembered with a
-masm of sorrowful regret that as Mrs. Mark
*l h ® ¥ d bnow n a happiness and
wards* that hac never been hers after-
She had died of too much glory in 1845.
But she had been a discreet woman, and
one who never allowed her discretion to
become anything else. She accepted all that
came to her, as the consort of Marcus Aurel-
ius, as a. gift from the gods that must never
be questioned, save in the very innermost
recesses of her tired and discontented secret
consciousness. If she alone could take no
pride in the surname that had become hers,
nobody ever knew that she couldn’t. Her
magnificent tombstone of Carara marble in
the Sandhills—which may, perhaps, still be
discoverable at La Perouse or South Head
" recorded the lie that she had been a happy
and devoted wife, a blessing and solace to her
sorrowing husband, and an honor to the
name she bore. But she would have died
much less discontentedly as Jane O’Reilly
than as Jane Aurelius.
Mark O’Reilly came to Hobart r l Down in
the middle of IS2O as surgeon of the con-
vict transport Pygmalion, found the place
to his liking, and settled down on the shores
of the Derwent with the intention of prac-
tising his profession or of engaging in trade.
His natural inclination was towards the
latter.
.P e was not a good surgeon ; the mortality
bill of the Pygmalion testifies to that, for
out of 147 male convicts carried by the
ship out of Plymouth Sound in the early part
ot the year, only 07 survived the voyage to
be landed ip Sullivan’s Cove, most as very
sick men, towards the end of June. It is
true that a bloodily suppressed mutiny that
occurred between Rio and the Cape of Good
Hope accounted for seven or eight of these
deaths, but for the most part the high mor-
tality on board was due to the ravages of
scurvy, dysentery and mal-nutrition, com-
bined with consistent neglect of duty on the
part of the surgeon and grasping tyranny
on that of the captain, aided and abetted by
the military officer in charge of the guard of
soldiers.
Lieut.-Governor Sorell was a little scan-
dalised by the Pygmalion’s very unsatisfac-
tory bill of health during her passage from
England, and made some inquiry into its
cause; but by a happy combination and
understanding which had been established be-
tween the commander, the soldier officer and
the surgeon, the death of more than a third
of the prisoners on board came to be re-
garded—not, it is true, without some sus-
picious misgivings on the part of his Honor
—as the act of God.
►So we first make the acquaintance of the
hero of this memoir at a little dinner of
celebration held in Hobart Town in August,
1820, when Captain Robert Blacklock, the
commander of the transport; Ensign Cowle,
who had been in charge of the guard; and
Dr. O'Reilly met together to mark the fact
that they were about to dissolve a partner-
ship that had been more than a little profit-
able to each of them, however disastrous
it might have been to the unfortunate
wretches they had brought, or failed to bring,
to Van Diemen’s Land. It was held at
the Doctor’s lodgings in Elizabeth-street, and
an excellent repast was provided by the
landlord of the Ship Inn, who lent his cook
for the occasion. The wines were good, and
the punch flowed freely, and the tongues of
the triumvirate so recently in power on the
Pygmalion were loosened to such confidential
extent that, had any outsider been present
and overheard the conversation, he would
easily have been able to account both for
the death-rate from disease and th e incidental
mutiny which had distinguished the voyage
concluded five weeks before.
“Well, gen’lemcn,” observed Captain
Blacklock, a stout mariner with a red
and puffy face, noticeable for its bright,
shrewd little eyes—a trifle watery at this
stage of the convivial proceedings—and a
thin-lipped, cruel mouth, “I’d make bold to
say that few speculations undertaken to Gi’
Derwent ha’ turned out half so well as
this of ours. ’Twas fortnit we was able to
get together in London, an’ to find ourselves
so unanimous minded about th’ bus’ness to
be undertook. We might ha’ been made for
one another—indeed, we might! I knoo th’
ropes, so far as how far a man might go
in dealin’ with owners and with Gov’mcnt.
Mr. Cowle turned out to be a young gent
not unwillin’ for to listen to reason w’en th’
argyment was put to him proper. An’ th’
Doctor, he turned out to be th’ very brains
an guts o th little venture we’ve just
brought to sich a successful finish. Doctor,
I looks tow r ards ye. Ye’re a credit to th’
medical profession. Ye’re a credit to ’uman-
lty. But more’n hanythink else, ye’ve an
’ead upon y’r shoulders—an ’eacf that’ll
take ye far. Very far, Doctor O’Reilly-
very far, indeed!”
Ensign . Cowle, very callow, weak-faced
and intoxicated, applauded these sentiments
with vigor. He banged his fist upon the
table, knocking over the bottle at his elbow,
and disdaining either to pick it up or to
stem the cascade of port that splashed his
unbuttoned tunic and his tight white regi-
mental pantaloons. He lurched forward and
clapped the Doctor on the back.
“An’ so shay all’v ush!” he hiccupped.
Jolly goo’ fel-lah, th’ Doctor. Splennid
fellah! Dunno what—what’d been done
without you, Doctor. Credit hu-humanity,
so y’are. Thash ri’ word, Cap’n—ri’ word.
Crerrit! Thash it ’xactly. Goo’ man-
ner?/ goo’ man. Y’health, Doctor —y’r verv
goo’ health!”
Ilis eyes closed, and he collapsed in his
chair, slipping gradually, with a grin upon
his silly face, until lie disappeared below the
table’s edge. The others let him lie upon
the floor, out of sight, seeming to be in tacit
agreement that there was the best place
for him.
Dr. O’Reilly nodded his handsome head.
He had an unusually frank and open coun-
tenance, and was rather more than merely
good-looking. The almost indefinable attri-
bute spoken of as “presence” was his to an
enviable degree. Wherever he might be, or
whatever he might be doing, his aspect was
always one that was blended of dignity and
attractiveness. Though he had drunk quite
as deeply as the captain and Ensign CowD
there was not the very slightest hint of
inebriation in his appearance or his man-
ner. lie looked cool, clever and entirely
master of himself —as indeed he was, then
and always afterwards. And the tone of his
voice when he spoke was one that ever

Look to Your Kidneys
Stop That Wearying Backache!
MAKE life a pleasure again. That pain in the small of
the back; that urinary disorder; that tired, nervous,
old and worn-out feeling; those headaches and dizzy
sensations; all may be due to kidney weakness, which can be over-
come. Worrying will not help you. Get fit and well by taking
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. This medicine gives the kidneys
the strengthening help they need, and so prevents rheumatism,
sciatica, lumbago, dropsy, stone in the kidney, or inflammation of
the bladder. Although Doan’s Pills relieve even these serious
symptoms, PREVENTION is by far the wiser plan. An occasional
course of Doan’s will keep you in good health.
CONVINCING PROOF FROM
SYDNEY.
A MAN’S CASE
Mr. A. Bartle, No. 3 Gladstone Street,
Bexley, Sydney, says: “Oil and on for years
I suffered with disordered kidneys, the result
being that I was tortured with backache.
When I had a bad attack my back used to
be so stiff and lame that I could not even
turn in bed without suffering agony. The
kidney secretions were affected, being thick
and cloudy with a red sediment, i was also
subject to* dizzy attacks and, generally speak-
ing, felt far from well. One day a friend,
hearing of a cure by Doan’s Kidney Pills,
urged me to try them. I bought some without
delay, and used them with excellent results.
The first bottle gave relief, and five bottles
made a complete and perfect cure.”
Ten years later, Mrs. Bartle says: “Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured my husband of
backache and kidney trouble over ten years
ago, and he has had no return of the com-
plaint since.”
A WOMAN’S CASE
Mrs. S. Drew, 28 Briggs Street, Camper-
down, Sydney, says: “Sometime ago my
kidneys were in a seriously disordered state
and in consequence I suffered terribly. My
back never stopped aching, and I was almost
crippled with the ailment. Dropsical swell-
ings showed on my legs and ankles, and theie
was puffiness under my eyes. The state of
my health worried me terribly and as I had
taken all sorts of remedies without deriving
any benefit, 1 was beginning to think I should
never be well again. However, at last 1 got
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and they proved
a godsend. The first couple of bottles
eased my suffering a little, and seven bottles
of the pills cured me completely.”
Seven years later, Mrs. Drew says: “I have
had no return of my old complaint since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me over
seven years ago.”

carried a conviction of innate truthfulness
and honesty to any who might hear it.
‘“Yes, my dear Blacklock,” he said, pleas-
antly, “I agree with you that, in so tar as
our venture in the Pygmalion has been con-
cerned, we have formed a very happy com-
bination. You knew the rope's, as you
say, aud I was able so to shape circum-
stances that they resulted to our advantage.
Our young friend beneath the table was
useful also—though usefulness of any sort
is not his most marked characteristic.
Captain Blacklock’s bulky frame shook
with a rumble of laughter. ‘“Ilo, ho, ho,
he chuckled. “Th’ silly young zany !
Dr. O’Reilly went on. “The cargo which
you were able to substitute for the ship s
ballast without the knowledge of the owners,
although contraband in this territory, has
sold exceedingly well. It was, of course, our
joint investment—but it is wholly due to
you that we were able to bring it with us.
or to get it ashore. The only credit, 1
think, that I am justly entitled to is with
respect to the convicts. When I came to
understand the terms of the contract with
the Board of Transport, and especially that
part of it which affects the victualling of
the transportees, and provides you with a
lump sum for their sustenance during the
voyage that is calculated upon the number
embarked —that they do not pay on the
number landed alive is inexplicable to me—
well, I saw a chance of adding very materi-
ally to your profits by speedily reducing
the number of mouths necessary to expend
rations upon. That, really, was a simple
matter. A lack of air and exercise and
the judicious use of irons, combined with a
want of cleanliness in the prison on the
’tween-decks and insufficiency of food and
bad water, do not make for good healtn
amongst a class of people naturally un-
healthy. They died very obligingly, as soon
as my course of treatment was in full swing.
Had the voyage been longer, we would have
done better, but we did not do so badly.
I am bound to acknowledge, Blacklock. that
you treated me handsomely—quite hand-
somely—in sharing with me the profits that
resulted from the sale of surplus rations
the other day.”
The sailor waved his churchwarden in
deprecation of this compliment.
“No, no, Doctor —not at all! ’Twas you
had the sense to devise the scheme —not me.
And tli’ mutiny likewise. And to persuade
that silly young under the table to
order his men to fire into the hold, so as
further to reduce the number we had to
provide with expensive prowisions. ’Twas a
stroke o’ genius, sir. I honors ye for it.
Ye’ve done wonders, Doctor. Wonders!
Gimme y’r hand, Doctor —gimme y’r hand.
Oh, clever — dam ’ clever!”
“You flatter me, Captain.”
“It couldn’t be done, sir—not poss’ble,
Dr. O’Reilly. And may I make bold for
to ask y’r honor what may be y’r plans for
th’ future? I’d say a man like you was
wasted out of London, sir. Why not come
back with me? I’d gladly hoffer ye me best
spare cabin —for th’ pleesure o’ y’r comp’ny,
Doctor.”
The doctor shook his head.
“No, Blacklock —I think not. London
and I are best apart —for a term of years,
at anyrate. No. I have, written to my wife
to join me here, and when she does so I
am going to settle down at Sydney—as a
merchant. The few months during which
I remain here will see my capital doubled—
I am certain of that. Then I will go to
Sydney, under another name. I will be not
Mark O’Reilly, but Marcus Aurelius. Have
you any recollection of hearing that name
before, Captain ?”
Captain Blacklock shook his head.
“Ah, well, it was once a very- well-known
name. It will do as well as another, and
I fully intend to invest it with a new repute.
I am confident that I will make it well
known in New South Wales —and elsewhere,
too.”
“Well, Doctor,” said the other, rising
ponderously, “when I come to Sydney I’ll
do meself the honor—’twill gimme very,
very great pleesure for to call upon Mr.—
how do you say it?—Mr. O-reel-yus. Ye’ll
remain for me a very great man, sir, what-
ever colors ye may sail under. A final
drink. Doctor, to th’ good fortune o’ Mr.
O-reel-yus, late Dr. O’Reilly. To our next
merry meeting, sir!”
But it was to be thirty years before these
two estimable gentlemen were to meet again.
And the meeting was not a merry one.
* * * *
In the year 1840, as he was riding home-
ward to his mansion upon the heights of
Woolloomooloo —the eligible and select sub-
urban area, beginning to be known as Dar-
linghurst, which lay to the eastward of the
town of Sydney—Mr. Marcus Aurelius was
accosted by a frowsy and objectionable indi-
vidual, very shabbily clad, who at first im-
pressed himself upon that discerning and
observant gentleman as being slightly under
the influence of liquor. This was most pro-
bably the case, since the seedy-looking per-
son had been ejected with force, violence and
oaths from a public house at the corner
of Bourke-street by the licensee.
The disreputable, spluttering blasphemies
and obscenities, had picked himself up
almost under the snorting nose of Mr.
Aurelius’s handsome bay, whom his top-
hatted and broadcloth-clad rider had been
compelled to rein in, in order to avoid over-
riding the miserable object who was thus
obstructing the King’s highway.
“Pray, be careful, my good fellow.” ob-
served Mr. Aurelius, “or you may be findiug
yourself in Woolloomooloo watch-house. Get
out of the way.”
Recovering his battered hat from the gut-
ter, the obstructionist turned to abuse this
insulter of the injured.
“Who th’ hell are you?” he began,
and then stopped, gaping and gasping, as
though suddenly afflicted with dumbness.
“Gawd split me tops’ls!” he presently
ejaculated, huskily, his watery little eyes
goggling with astonishment. “Well I’ll be
damned if it ain’t Dr. O’Reilly!”
With a start the immaculate equestrian
wheeled his horse, and faced the deadbeat
at the pavement’s edge.
“What the Devil? ——— Who are you, my
to reoall your face?”
With his hat in his hand, and a fatuous
leer spreading over his blotched, mottled and
unshaven fat jowl, the unpleasant-looking
person made a clumsy attempt at a bow.
“Lord save us, Doctor —don’t you remem-
ber Bob Blacklock —old Bob Blacklock wot
one time was skipper o’ th’ barque Pygma-
lion, the ship as brought ye to Hobart I own,
’way back in eighteen-twenty!
Sitting erect in the saddle, the handsome
elderly man—he was about sixty, but as
trim and active-looking as he had been thirty
years before, with hardly anything' in his
appearance to indicate his age save the silver
mane of hair below the back of his hat rim
—peered for a few’moments at liis unsavory
acquaintance before he spoke. >' hen at
length he did so it was in a precise ana
authoritative fashion such as might be used
by a man unaccustomed to having Ins sug-
gestions disregarded. As lie did so he gathered
up his reins, touched his mount s on rib
gently with the spur and moved upon lus
way.
“You may follow after me to my house,
Blacklock. It is but a short distance off.
I desire to have some conversation with
you.”
“Strike me!” muttered the ex-master
mariner. I may follow arter ye, me bucko,
may I! Seems to me ye’ll be a-follerin arter
Bob Blacklock afore very long, a-beggm ot
’im for to keep ’is mouth shut. Well see
about you, me lad.”
As Mr. Aurelius handed his horse to the
groom in the carriage drive before his splen-
did mansion of Hawkesbury sandstone, lie
instructed him to mount it immediately and
go in search of a policeman, telling him that
he would find one approaching the corner of
Macleay-street. To his dignified butler, open-
ing the door for him and receiving his hat,
he issued instructions to admit to the library
without question a dilapidated individual
who would presently demand admission.
Also, he informed the immaculate upper ser-
vant that there would before long appear a
constable, who was to be requested to wait
in the entrance hall until the ringing of
his bell within the library should signal
the moment for his introduction to. that
spacious apartment. Then he went in, to
await his visitor.
“So there y’are, Doctor —that’s what s hap-
pened to me. I was transported, as I've told
ye, for forgin’ bills o’ ladin’. I done time
at Port Harthur. I got flogged there. I’ve
done more time since—at Port Phillip. I've
had a hell of a time of it—an’ here’ve you
been becomin’ a rich man and a great man,
as I always said ye would. D’ye remember
that little dinner in Hobarton the night
before I sailed for England in 1820? With,
that young dam' fool Ensign Cowle, who we
diddled so fine on the voyage hout? T said
so then, an’ it’s come true, as I always
knew it would.”
There was in the old sailor's husky voice
a note of admiration which he could not
suppress. He went on to expound the ob ject
of the visit he had always intended to make
to his old friend and business associate and
which had been so fortunately hastened that
morning.
“I got away from th’ gang I was with at
Port Phillip last year. Had a hell of a
time of it since, a-comin’ up to Sydney
overland, not having dared to try for a pas-
sage by sea, for fear th’ peelers’d lay a holt
o’ me. But now I'm here, and 1 look to
you, Doctor, for to treat me handsome, if
on’y for the sake o’ them times together, w’en
I ’elped ye start y’r great fortin’ in my ole
ship, th’ "good ole Pygmalion. You ain’t for-
got that, I’ll take my davy! I want to get
back to England, safe an’ free, with enough
good money for to start in th’ public line
as a licensed wietualler. ’Tis but a little to
you. Doctor —th’ price o’ my holdin’ me
tongue—but,” he paused impressively, to
emphasise the alternative- —“’twould be an
’ell of a thing for you, Mister Marcus Aur-
elius, if I wasn't for to ’old me tongue.”
Throughout the recital of his visitor’s long
and wandering narrative, Mr. Aurelius had
kept silence. Now he made his first remark
of comment upon it.
“It must have been difficult to get away
from that prisoners’ gang at South Yarra,
Captain—very difficult. So you are really,
as they say in the colonies, ‘a bolter’?”
“That’s it, Doctor, an’ I can assure you
’tis a devil of a thing ev’ry time a constable
heaves over th’ horizon —you never know
he’s not a-lookin’ partic’lar for you y’self.
A hell of a thing it is.”
“Ah well, Blacklock, I must do what I
can to relieve you of such a state of suspense.
You think you’d be all right in England?”
The sodden wreck got to his feet, and
advanced towards Mr. Aurelius, both hands
outstretched in a gesture of gratitude.
“Ah-h, Gawd reward ye. Doctor, for y’r
kindness. Gobbless you always.”
“Just ring that bell on the table beside
you, will you, Blacklock, if you please?”
The door opened, and the butler ushered
in the policeman.
“Constable,” said Mr. Aurelius, “I wish to
commit this man to your custody on a
charge of being a runaway convict from
Port Phillip. Now, my man,” he said to
the astounded old sailor, “I think it will
pay you to go quietly—and to remain quiet.
I think you owe me some thanks —for having
relieved you of anxiety.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I have gone back to childhood in a day,
Watching the sunshine dapple the rough
track,
Where a faint wind croons on the bracken-
way,
And a far flight of birds comes wheeling
back.
Here, where the red road twists and climbs
a hill,
Where the white gums stand straight
against the blue,
And every jarring note is hushed and still.
I can go back to childhood —and to you!
