LITERARY NOTES.
Louis Becke's New Book,
“ The Ebbing of the Tide,” Louis Becke’s
new book, collects those of his stories in re-
gard to which The Bulletin has already ex-
pressed a chastened surprise at the honorable
nonduct of the British publisher. Many of
these stories were originally paid contribu-
tions to The Bulletin ; others first appeared
m the North Queensland Register (Char-
ters Towers) and the Sunday Times (Sydney).
Literary and artistic contributions to The
Bulletin are covered by general copyright;
but this journal does not claim copyright
against its contributors, and, in ceding to
Mr. Becke the right of republication of his
Bulletin stories, the only stipulation made
was a verbal stipulation that in any reprint
tiie fact of first publication in The Bulletin
should be acknowledged—in accordance with
ordinary courtesy and ordinary usage. In
Becke’s first book, “By Reef and Palm,”
tiiis stipulation was duly complied with ; in
the case of his second book, several of the
stories were re-sold to Mr. Clement Shorter,
of the Illustrated London News, and ap-
peared as new and original in the publica-
tions of the I.L. News proprietary—the
Album, the Sketch, the English Illustrated
Magazine —and elsewhere. To secure a
sale, the fact of previous publication was
apparently suppressed : Mr. Shorter tells
The Bulletin that had he known the facts
he would not have published the stories. And
now, in defiance of courtesy, usage, and
right, the tales are reprinted in volume form
without a word to tell of previous publica-
tion, either in Australia or in England.
* * * *
For these proceedings Mr. Becke disowns
responsibility ; and The Bulletin cheer-
fully exonerates him. It would be unjust
to saddle Mr. Becke with the little eccen-
tricities of Fisher Unwin, his antipodal pub-
lisher—of whom, by the way, he had the
other day to complain that the name of Walter
Jeffery, his collaborator in another new
story, was suppressed on publication in the
Illustrated London News, apparently be-
cause Becke was known and Jeffery un-
known, and it was thought that Jeffery’s
name might interfere with the sale of their
■joint work. All that this paper cares to do
under the circumstances is to recite the facts
as another tribute to the versatile genius of
John Bull, whose sense of honor, wdiere
cash is concerned, is as keen as a sixpenny
razor.
* * « *
Criticism of Becke’s new book begins with
Lts title, which, one gathers, is owed also to
his publisher. Considering that Stevenson
attempted to exploit the field of South Sea
romance ; that “ The Ebb Tide ” is the title
of a well-known book to which his name is
attached ; and that Becke is first and fore-
most a South Sea romancer; “The Ebb-
ing of the Tide, by Louis Becke,”
seems obviously intended to suggest, and
does suggest, that Becke is a sort
of “colonial Stevenson,” a parasite of
the Samoan “ Tusitala ” whom the British
mind has been educated to admire, a timid
disciple who asks for British appreciation
from the safe shelter of “ the Master’s ”
cloak. The suggestion is false in idea and
fact. Stevenson was a wonderful craftsman,
but with all his art he could not present a
man or woman in five pages as Becke does
in five sentences. His Adams are marvellous
combinations of dust, his rarer Eves would
make any rib proud to mother them, but he
could not breathe the breath of life into
either. Becke is, of all things, alive, vivid,
vital. His characters leap at you from the
printed page. No one dreams of comparing
his total achievement with Stevenson’s, but
tn Becke’s special sphere Stevenson is a
weakling by comparison : all his art fails to
reach the eloquence of Becke’s simple touch
®f nature.
* * * •
In Becke’s new book his graphic talent has
again full scope. It says much for him that
“ The Ebbing of the Tide ” is, on the whole,
quite as good as “By Reef and Palm.”
There are more weak spots ; the note of
monotony begins to be heard ; but the best
things are memorable. “ Luliban of the
Pool,” for example, not alone from its in-
trinsic interest, but even more from its wide
human suggestion, ranks as high as—per-
haps higher than—anything Becke has
attempted. The king, the woman, the men
who fight for her, the priests who help to
dupe a savage populace—these are im-
memorial figures in the human drama ; and
the scene they enact has been repeated a
thousand times in human history. “At a
Kava-Drinking ” and “ Kennedy the Boat-
Steerer ” are as good—histories of real men
and women, loving warmly, hating keenly,
and placed before us still palpitating with
the emotions that strained their natures to
the highest pitch of intensity. The vigor
and truth of the narrative can hardly be
praised too highly. The South Sea epic of
Drown women and white men will never find
a better interpreter than Louis Becke.
* * * *
A careful re-perusal of “Byßeef and Palm”
and “The Ebbing of the Tide ” strengthens
the conviction that Becke has very many of
the qualities which make a really great
writer. He needs only a little more art, a
fittle more restraint, a little more sense of
proportion; and all these things come with
practice and striving. r At'present, Becke has
more dramatic instinct'than dramatic talent.
His mind is so full that he is embarrassed
with crowding details which he cannot re-
duce to their proper subordination. In story
.after story his main conception is obscured
by the mass of surrounding incidents placed
in the same light, on the same plane. Take
Deschard of Oneaka, ” in the new volume.
Here is the germ of a most powerful tale, its
motive the best in Becke’s repertory. On a
South Sea atoll lives Harry Deschard, an
escaped convict and leader of the natives.
One morning a schooner anchors near the
islet. He plots to cut her out, murder the
crew, and take possession of the vessel. The
plot succeeds admirably. The captain and
three passengers (of whose presence the
assailants are ignorant) take refuge in the
cabin. Deschard turns one of the ship’s six-
pounders against the door, and blows them
out of existence. Then, going through the
ship s papers, he comes across an agreement
by the captain to convey Henry Deschard,
Anna Deschard, and their children to a safe
port. The mangled bodies in the cabin are
those of his own wife and daughters, who
have sought him out with infinite hopes and
fears, to give him a chance of regeneration.
And Deschard shoots himself.
* * * *
Here is a theme almost HUschylean in
scope and grandeur : by odds the noblest
Becke has ever dealt with. He has plainly
a vision of its potency, yet he handles it
lamely, almost tediously, with not a tithe of
his own capacity. Page after page is filled
with weak or irrelevant details ; the story is
told half as fact and half as fiction ; the
reader s attention is perpetually diverted
from the main issues; and the final im-
pression left on his mind is compara-
tively vague and confused. With a little
remodelling and a good deal of pruning the
value and force of the tale could have been
doubled.
* * . * *
The point involved is the point raised by a
recent Bulletin contributor who suggested
many things which he did not satisfactorily
settle : the need of scenery in a short story.
Now, a little consideration will make it
evident that the only justification of scenery
is as an aid to the story. The Story is the
thing to consider. Whatever helps it, pre-
pares the way for it, deepens the impression
which it makes upon the reader, is an advan-
tage : anything more is a disadvantage. Thus
the introduction—if there is an intro-
duction must be always germane to
the story, and must never overweight
it. The shorter the story, the shorter
should be the introduction, as a matter
of course. A composer precedes an opera
with an overture, but he never dreams
of overturing each concerted number in the
opera : at most, he gives a preparatory
bar or two. So, in The Bulletin, where
considerations of space limit most story-
tellers to about two columns, it would be
obviously inadvisable to spend a column, or
even half-a-column, in an introduction, how-
ever intrinsically brilliant, which did not
help the story. or the climax. To take
another illustration from another art : the
effect of a statue is conceivably increased,
and its beauty is better seen, when it is
placed on a pedestal. But the pedestal must
always be in proportion to the statue, and
suited to the situation. A statue in the open
air, in a public place, might be advantage-
ously raised twenty or thirty feet from
the ground : in a gallery, a height of
five or ten feet would be sufficient.
But Becke occasionally, as in “At a Kava-
Drinking,” prefaces an eleven-page yarn
with a five-page introduction which does not
aid, but rather weakens the force of his
story, while he could have crystallised into
twenty lines a more vivid, definite picture of
the circumstances which brought about its
telling.
Louis Becke’s merits are above depreciation:
his demerits are a small thing by comparison,
and he has plenty of time to remedy them—
if he will take it. He has safely skirted the
familiar second-book gulf. His fertility
shows no signs of exhaustion, and his success
has stimulated many other local writers. To
adapt a big phrase to our little sphere, he
might be called in prose, as “The Banjo”
in verse, the leader of an Australian literary
Renascence.

A BEVY OF BALLADES.
Ballade of the Southern Cross.
Fair islands of the silver fleece,
Hoards of unsunned, uncounted gold,
Whose havens are the haunts of Peace,
Whose boys are in our quarrel bold ;
Our bolt is shot, our tale is told,
Our ship of state in storms may toss,
But ye are young if we are old,
Ye Islands of the Southern Cross !
Aye, we must dwindle and decrease,
Such fates the ruthless years unfold;
And yet we shall not wholly cease,
We shall not parish unconsoled ;
Nay, still shall Freedom keep her hold
Within the sea’s inviolate fosse,
And boast her sons of English mould,
Ye Islands of the Southern Cross !
All empires tumble—Rome and Greece—
Their swords are rust, their altars cold !
For us, the Children of the Seas,
Who ruled where’er the waves have rolled,
For us, in Fortune’s books enserolled,
I read no runes of hopeless loss ;
Nor—while ye last—our knell is tolled,
Ye Islands of the Southern Cross 1
Envoy.
Britannia, when thy hearth’s a-cold,
When o’er thy grave has grown the moss,
Still Rule Australia shall be trolled
In Islands of the Southern Cross !
ANDREW-IAN.
The Ballad' of Imitation.
“ C'egt imiter quelqu'un que de planter deg choux."
—Alfred de Musset.
If they hint, O Musician, the piece that you
played
Is nought but a copy of Chopin or Spohr ;
That the ballad you sing is but merely “conveyed ”
From the stock of the Arnes and the Purcells of
yore;
That there’s nothing, in short, in the words or
the score,
That is not as worn-cut as the “ Wandering
Jew ”;
Make answer—Beethoven could scarcely do
more—
That the man who plants cabbages imitates, too !
If they tell you, Sir Artist, your light and your
shade
Are simply “ adapted ” from other men’s lore ;
That—plainly to speak of a “ spade ” as a
“ spade”—
You’ve “stolen” your grouping from three or
from four ;
That (however the writer the truth may deplore),
’Twas Gainsborough painted your “Little Boy
Blue ”;
Smile only serenely—though cut to the core —
For the man who plants cabbages imitates, too !
And you, too, my Poet, be never dismayed
If they whisper your Epic—“ Sir Eperond’Or ”
Is nothing but Tennyson thinly arrayed
In a tissue that’s taken from Morris’s store;
That no one, in fact, but a child could ignore
That you “lift” or “ accommodate ” all that you
do;
Take heart—though your Pegasus’ withers be
sore—
For the man who plants cabbages imitates, too !
Postscriptum.— And you, whom we all so adore,
Dear Critics, whose verdicts are always so new!—
One word in your ear. There were Critics before . .
And the man who plants cabbages imitates, too 1
AUSTIN DOBSON.
Ballade of Primitive Man.
He lived in a cave by the seas,
He lived upon oysters and foes,
But his list of forbidden degrees
An extensive morality shows ;
Geological evidence goes
To prove he had never a pan,
But he shaved with a shell whpn he chose,
'Twas the manner of Primitive Man !
He worshipped the rain and the breeze,
He worshipped the river that flows,
And the Dawn, and the Moon, and the tree*
And bogies, and serpents, and crows;
He buried his dead with their toes
Tucked up—an original plan—
Till their knees came right under their nose
’Twas the manner of Primitive Man 1
His communal wives, at his ease,
He would curb with occasional blows;
Or his State had a queen, like the bees
(As another philosopher trows):
When he spoke it was never in prose,
But he sang in a strain that would scan,
For (to doubt it, perchance, were morose)
'Twas the manner of Primitive Man !
Envoy.
Max, proudly your Aryans pose,
But their rigs they undoubtedly ran,
For, as every Darwinian knows,
’Twas the manner of Primitive Man !
ANDREW LANG.
A Ballade of Old Sweethearts.
Who is it that weeps for the last year’s flowers
When the wood is aflame with the fires of spring
And we hear tier voice in the iilao bowers *
As she croons the runes of the blossoming?
For the same old blooms do the new years” bring;
But not to our lives do the years come so,
New lips must kiss and new bosoms cling.—
Ah ! lost are the loves of the long ago.
Ah me ! for a breath of those morning hours
When Alice and I went awandering
Through the shining fields, and it still was ours
To kiss and to feel we were shuddermg—
Ah me ! when a kiss was a holy thing.—
How sweet were a smile from Maud, and oh !
With Phyllis once more to be whispering.
Ah ! lost are the loves of the long ago.
But it cannot be that old Time devours
Such loves as was Annie’s and mine we sing,
And surely beneficent heavenly powers
Save Muriel’s beauty from perishing;
And if in some golden evening
To a quaint old garden I chance to go,
Shall Marion no more by the wicket sing?—
Ah ! lost are the loves of the long ago.
In these lives of ours do the new years bring
Old loves as old flowers again to blow ?
Or do new lips kiss and new bosoms cling?—
Ah ! lost are the loves of the long ago.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne's Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg.
ment from a sense of rlnty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the hack and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
D Ft.. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in

in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

BEFORE YOU
T. E A Ft
When you go out shopping, consider, think
■of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and C,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
(reorge-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice of
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned ; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round—
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer—for you to plead : There would have
been enough and to spare had I been wise

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“GET OUT—I’M' WRITING HOME.”
A voice in the tent to the voice outside
Growled, “ Go to the devil, do !
m °®. y° ur tents ! for I’m not at home
To-night to the likes of you.”
We are coming in ! ” “ You’d better not,
Or out you’ll shift again ;
Spirits of mischief, get off to the deuce !
To-night I’m a knight of the pen.
“ There’s a boot for one and a boot for two,
You know I’m a splendid shot;
There’s a towel three, and a pillow four,
Keep out or I’ll pelt the lot.”
’Twas away out West where the gold is found,
Or where it’s supposed to be ;
Where you live on hope when you can’t get bread,
And you drink—well—dream-made tea.
Defiant of threats, a couple of heads
Slid in at the canvas door ;
They dodged the pillow, the towel and boots,
And their owners took the floor.
They took the floor (good reason why,
Out West we don’t keep chairs),
And four long limbs, Australian-bred,
Sprawled out in royal pairs.
And their owners smoked their pipes, content,
And said they’d come to stay;
They’d been mates, you see, for many a day,
These three at work or play.
“ We have just dropped in for a smoke, old boy,
Only a smoke and a chat,
With a game of euchre or whist or nap
What are you grumbling at ? ”
“ Get off the grass ! Clear out, now ! Shift ! ”
Came the answer unpolite ;
“ I’m writing—move off ! —l’m writing to home,
I’ll play you to-morrow night.
“ I must write to-night or I’ll miss the mail,
So shift your lumbering frames !
They’ll expect this letter at home from me,
Get out ! don’t jump their claims !
“They know to the day when the post will come
And eager they’ll look for it;
It wouldn’t be fair if I missed it now,
So you two fellows may quit.
“ A small young brother will stand at the gate
To watch for the postman’s coat,
And a tiny sister will wait at his side
For the letter that Charlie wrote.
“ ‘ I tan see his toat, I tan see his toat,
I hear the youngsters cry,
And off down the street go four little feet
As fast as wee legs can fly.
“ Then back in triumph they’ll carry their prize,
Their bright eyes flashing glad,
And their eager shout—l can hear it now :
‘ A letter from Tarlie, Dad.’
“ And the old man tries to look unconcerned,
But, deep down under his vest,
He’s as anxious as they to know what says
The lad in the wild far West.
“ Then there’s my mother —well, here, you fellows,
1 reckon you’d better roam,
Shift your long lumbering limbs out of here !
Get out ! I’m writing' to home.”
CRAGS.
BUCKED OFF ITS BRAND.
Take my word ! he could buck, could Brown Baron;
And to ride ! Who cotdd ride like long Jac k ?
There was never a thing born with hair on
Could throw him when once on its back.
Tn the crush went on saddle and bridle,
And he set Jack a go pretty hard ;
But his previous efforts seemed idle
When we flung down the rails of the yard.
A few bucks, and the gear was all lying—
Busted girths, broken bit —on the sand ;
And away through the trees he went flying—
Nothing on him but Jack and the brand.
Through the paddock the Baron went sailing ;
Jack was keeping him straight with his hat
When we saw him jump over the railing
At the creek on the Kurrajong Flat.
And then—where on earth were they hidden ?
Though the boss swore he’d soon have ’em back,
And rode as he never had ridden,
The traps had to start on their track.
But Jack was not beaten by trifles,
And, .when he and the Baron were found,
It took four police, ditto rifles,
Ere the long-’un set foot on the ground.
When we came to examine the Baron,
All the brand-mark had disappeared clean :
’Twas the horse, we could swear--a great scar on
The place where the Z 9 had been.
Jack explained, in the dock at his trial,
That the horse slung his brand on the track ;
To the charge gave indignant denial -
Said, when shot he was just coming back. _
Jack sits now on stones for a saddle,
And for reins has a hammer in hand
’Cause an ignorant Judge chose to twaddle
That a horse couldn’t buck off its brand.

SATURDAY, APRIL 11, 1890.
Tombs and Other Matters.
The periodical outbreak of typhoid, which
arrives in Sydney and Melbourne once or
twice a year, turned up recently, as usual,
and excited a certain languid interest amongst
those not attacked. Typhoid in one or two
Australian cities —principally in loathsome
and undrained Perth —-is always more or less
in evidence, and the other cities are visited
by it at longer or shorter intervals. When
typhoid is not present diphtheria or some
other dirt-disease generally takes its place,
and when none of these epidemics is specially
noticeable, the community is generally
harassed more or less about the steady,
continuous increase of cancer, tuberculosis,
and other unnatural agencies which cut off
mankind before its time. Science has now
practically decided that man, if not killed by
accident or illegal violence or judicial execu-
tion, should only die of old age, and that
every cause of death save old age is merely
the outcome of ignorance or neglect. All
the innumerable diseases which used to be
piously summed up as the “act of God” are
now recognised as the results of dirt, over-
crowding, want of light, bad drainage,
diseased meat, decayed and leprous vege-
tables, impure water, and unnatural modes
of living generally. As sanitation pro-
gresses disease diminishes and the average
duration of life increases—in England, it
is now something over 40 years, whereas five
or six centuries ago it seems to have been
only about 14 years ; and it appears quite
probable that a time will yet arrive when
every man may live, if he pleases, to the age
of 100 years, and become a long and dreadful
weariness to himself and all his acquaint-
ances by so doing.
* * * *
Despite the overturn of all the old ideas
of sanitation, however, one of the unclean
habits of onr-unelean. forefathers is still pre-
served as a holy rite by the mass of the
population. The disposal of the dead goes
on in practically the same primitive fashion
as it did fifteen centuries ago ; and how much
sudden death and slow murder by maudlin
sentiment it has caused, and is still causing,
no one will ever know. In specially infec-
tious cases, the room which the corpse has
occupied is carefully disinfected to remove
the germs of disease, and the clothing he has
worn is burned, because fire is the only agent
which will destroy the bacteria with absolute
certainty, and thus cut off all possibility of
further infection. Then the mortal remains
are carefully deposited in the rich, damp
soil, that the disease germs may grow and
multiply exceedingly among the corruption
and the worms and the poisonous ex-
halations ; and the official ghoul comes
along periodically and digs up the tainted
earth to make room for more coffins,
and thereby scatters the infection upon
the four winds. Also the rain-waters
percolate among the dead, and go away laden
with the elements of typhoid, cancer, tuber-
culosis, diphtheria, leprosy, and other com-
plaints, to enrich the pastures and thereby
cultivate the diseased cow 7 that supplies the
community with tainted meat and milk. Or
they travel by long and devious ways into
wells and reservoirs, and leave a faint,
sickly-flavor of the dead in the water which
is consumed by the living, and infinitesimal
particles of the deceased ancestor are found
there and are briefly described by the analyst
as “ decomposed organic matter. ” Then, in
the course of years, the cemetery is filled up
with death and decomposition and is aban-
doned, and in the course of more years it
loses its distinctive character and is used
possibly for building ground or for pasture,
and a new generation lives on top of the
unwholesome mass, with possible conse-
quences which need not be further enlarged
upon.
* * * *
When the casual ,/ or bullock dies of
some especially infectious disease the law, in
civilised countries, orders the destruction of
its carcase by fire, to prevent the spread of
ufecbion. When a human being dies of the
..line complaint or one equally dangerous,
he law allows the remains to be buried
under conditions which guarantee that their
m pacify for spreading infection w r ill be pre-
served as long as possible, and the general
public sentiment, for some unexplained
reason, seems to regard compulsory crema-
tion as an outrage, and clings lovingly to
“the grave” as part of its creed and its
civilisation. Public sentiment is advancing,
certainly, but in this particular direction it
advances very slowly. The ordinary process
of burial is a method by which the deceased
is gradually transposed into a shapeless,
putrid object —a gassy thing without form or
outline, for the midnight worm to associate
with and for every other living creature to
avoid ; yet somehow 7 this awful relic has
been surrounded by a halo of poetry, and
the great mass of the community is reluctant
to hart w T ith it. Cremation, on the other
hand, is a clean and wholesome process, and
is as little shocking to the sense of any
logical being as any process for the disposal
of the dead well can be. Moreover, it does
away with one of the worst horrors of the
old process one concerning which the
lugubrious romancist has spread himself for
many years —the possibility of premature
burial. Whether burial before death is
common or not, no -one really knows—except
the people w r ho are prematurely buried, and
they offer no explanation on the point. But
soqie authorities certainly profess to believe
that 'it is a common thing to mistake mere
insensibility for death. Others have ad-
vanced the opinion that at least one form of
alleged death, that by frost, is not extinction
as is commonly supposed, but merely sus-
pension of life for an indefinite period, or
rather indefinite preservation of life ; and
that the individual who was frozen in a land
of perpetual ice tqn centuries ago, and who
has remained froze ever since, is still alive,
and will remain so unless killed by injudicious
thawing, and that consequently his survival
underground may be next to eternal. And still
others have advanced the idea—which no one
is or seems likely to be in a position either
to prove or to controvert—that so-called
death is merely a species of permanent
paralysis of the body accompanied by reten-
tion of consciousness for an undefined period,
and that consequently everybody , so far as
consciousness goes, is buried alive. Assum-
ing that there is anything in any of these
theories—and no one can absolutely prove
that there is not—cremation, which means
almost instantaneous destruction by intense
heat, certainly looks far more humane than
the long horror and blackness and utter
silence underground, with the dead weight
of the globe overhead, and nothing beneath
and all around but blackness and more globe
and perpetual silence.
* * * *
Apart from all hygienic and other con-
siderations, the abolition of the present
method would have a good effect upon the
mental condition of those who are still alive.
It would be a long time before the lugubrious
bard could learn to fit his melody to the new
conditions ; many years of rhyming “ tomb ”
with “gloom,” and maundering about the
grass that grows above the grave, and the
cypress tree, and the sepulchre, and the clods
that fall on the coffin and such-like properties,
have forced him into a groove, and, until a
new generation of bards arose, this depres-
sing variety of verse would be at a
serious discount. Cremation would also
do away—at least, The Bulletin hopes
so—with the weepful cemetery, and drive
that morbid class - of people who go on
Sundays and holidays to spell out the in-
scriptions on the tombstones, and to show
their children the broken urns and the
epitaphs, and to sit beneath the dark-green
trees whose roots are down among the multi-
tudinous deceased, and to maunder over
“ dust ” and similar subjects, into some more
healthful form of recreation. It. wouM do
away this paper also trusts, with the dismal
hearse and the plumes, and the long row o,
empty carriages behind, and the hansom cab
with a fat man asleep in it at the rear of the
procession; and the card-parties
mourning coaches ; and it might e\ en a -
the undertaker as we know hnn—that woe-
ful-looking red-nosed person with the paid-
for depression on his countenance who chives
slowly and sadly to the cemetery, and drives
back from it at a joyful trotmmgled with beer.
It ought to put an end, also, to the dismal,
soft-footed person who comes to measure
the body,” and-to the old female with the
gin-breath who “lays it out.” In all pio-
bability it would badly discourage the m
memoriam ” verses in the Age, which have
long been in want of active discouragement ,
and it should put a summary closure upon
the aspiring person who writes verses con-
cerning the hackneyed “bush burial. In
short, it would revolutionise the most dreadful
department of modern life and the most
wailsome branch of modern literature, and
anything that seriously damages the tomb
variety of literature deserves the support of
every healthy-minded person.
* * * *
The one serious reason advanced against
cremation is that it at once and for ever
destroys all possibility of gaining information
as to the cause of death. In the case of
murder by poison it happens, about once in
a million instances, that some information,
often of no particular value, is gained by dis-
interring somebody deceased; in most in-
stances, owing to the person in question
being altogether too much deceased, no
information worth speaking about is pro-
curable. Under a system of compulsory
cremation, however, it is quite possible that
the law would require a [jjs!-mortem exami-
nation in every case of death, simply because
there would be no possibility of investi-
gation later on. In that case, there
would be a decided advantage attached to
the new system. As things are now,
the post-mortem is an extraordinary ex-
pedient, and even to ask for such a
thing implies grave suspicion and creates a
serious scandal. Many experts connected
with life-assurance business are of opinion
that secret murder by poison is much more
common than is supposed, but it is only pos-
sible to demand an investigation where rea-
sonably strong evidence can be adduced.
Therefore, a large number of suspicious cases
pass without investigation, covered by the
certificate of some doctor who is either in-
experienced, or incapable, or venal, or who
gives the document to cover up his own
mistakes ; and the matter is allowed to
drop, simply because an insurance office
which habitually creates trouble thereby
falls into disfavor. The amount of know-
ledge conserved by the present method
is too minute to be worth considering as an
argument in its favor. And when all the
things in its disfavor are considered—the
contamination of water-supplies, the careful
preservation of the germs of deadly disease,
the lamentable poetry about the “silent
grave ” and the alleged flower which grows
thereon, the lying epitaphs and the mentally
diseased people who go to read them, the
ancient grave-digger about whom so many
maunderings have been perpetrated, the
gruesome hearse and the black, bony steeds
which draw it along, the fatal colds acquired
by so many mourners while standing by
while the cold blast whistles round the coffin
and the officiating clergyman, the alleged
ghost which gibbers on the headstone, the
worms and the corpse-lights and the poison-
ous exhalations, the badly-drained cemetery,
where the late-lamented is found in two feet
of greenish water when his resting-place is
opened for the accommodation of another
deceased, and all the rest of the dank and
bony melancholy—when all these things are
taken into account any system which is clean
and sudden and wholesome and effective is
a change for the better.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A converted Foreign-trader.
A leading New South Wales Foreign-trader
named Goodlet has announced his conversion
to Protection under the influence of the new
tariff. Mr. Goodlet is connected with cement
and the new system struck his industry all of a
heap. Cement can be made more cheaply at
present in Europe than it can in New South
Wales, partly because wages are lower and
partly because the works, having a larger popu-
lation to support them than exists in this
country, are mostly on a much larger scale, and
working on a large scale means the more ex-
tended use of machinery and many other
economies. The difference in distance doesn’t
compensate for the disadvantages under which
the local makers labor ; it costs 6d. a cask to
send cement by rail from Granville to
Sydney, while cement is brought from Eng-
land to Sydney as ballast at Is. a cask, and tlTe
odd 6d. doesn’t nearly make up for the other
outlays. This is the same trouble which
the .wav-back farmer encounters iu competing
with sea-borne imports. There are no rails to
lay on the ocean, no stations, sidings, embank
meuts, bridges and tunnels to make, no land to
be resumed for the permanent way ; the ocean
doesn’t require constant repairs ; there are no
signalmen, lengthsmen, fettlers and gatekeepers
to pay out in the middle of the deep ; the large
ocean tramp, in proportion to its cost, carries
far more than the locomotive and requires much
fewer men to work it for each 1000 tons
of capacity. The wages of the seaman are
lower than those of the railway employe. j n
the case of the huge, fast sailing-vessels which
now dot the ocean there is no skilled labor iu
the shape of engineers to demand high wages,
no coals, no oil, no expensive engines to repair,
and the outlay is.kept down to an almost irre-
ducible minimum. Moreover, there is a large
trade in second-hand ships, and in many cases
the present owner of the vessel has bought it
from some bankrupt person in a glutted market
for half or a-third of its value, while the rail-
way department can’t buy second-hand tunnels
and permanent way and stations below cost;
the railway has to make interest on the
full value of its properties, while the owner
of a cargo-ship often has to make interest on
half or one-third the value only. The cargo-
ship, too, needn’t be kept in very careful
repair ; it can be put under some cheap and
disreputable foreign flag and sent out at last to
sink for the insurance money, while the railway
can’t. Also the ship can’t move without bal-
last, and when cargo is scarce it is glad to take
heavy goods, such as cement, for stiffening pur-
poses for next to nothing, to save the final
necessity of buying ballast and carrying it
absolutely gratis. Therefore, there is nothing
extraordinary in the fact that certain goods
can be carried, under certain circumstances,
6000 miles by sea about as cheaply as they can
50 or 100 miles by land, and the fact doesn’t
prove that the railway rates are excessive, or
should be reduced —it only proves that the con-
ditions are wholly unequal. Consequently,
there is nothing surprising in the fact that the
N.S.W. cement industry is going to wreck.
The one thing which is surprising is that
Mr. Goodlet, as a brainy man of business
didn’t see all this in time to prevent him howl-
ing for the great Foreign-trade cause, as he
apparently did up to a very few months ago.
The Maoriland Election.
If the Seddon Government gets another three
years’ lease of office as the result of the 1896
elections, it will be about the most remarkable
—if not the most remarkable—Ministry which
ever existed in Australasia. It has already
lasted through two Parliaments, and has had
nearly six continuous years of power, and its
majority remains practically unimpaired. It
was created in 1890, when John Ballanck was
still alive, and Richard of Kumara was his
first lieutenant, and it started with a large ma-
jority. It went to the country in 1893, and
came back, contrary to all precedent, with a
still larger majority. The ordinary course of
things is that a Government begins with a large
following, which steadily diminishes through
its three years of office until the next general
election, when it is decisively rejected. Then
the other party comes in with a big majority,
which fades away in like manner, till another
election comes along and it is also cast out, and
the previous men come back to go through the
same process all over again. Under the party-
system the people and the Parliament can’t
amend the Ministry’s bills if they think them
unsatisfactory, or undo any of its acts, or reject
part of its policy and endorse the remainder, or
reject one member of the Ministry ami keep the
remainder; all it can do is to accept all the
Ministry and all its policy, or else throw it out
bodily and entrust the same irresponsible power
to someone else. And, as hardly any Ministry
is fit to be trusted with such power, the country
generally throws out every Ministry at the first
opportunity, with the vague idea that the other
lot can’t be worse than the present lot—quite
regardless of the fact that the other lot had
previously been thrown out on exactly the same
grounds. There have been hardly more than
three occasions in Australasian history when a
Ministry, after serving the full term of one
Parliament, has returned with a majority, and
it is questionable if any Ministry ever came
back a second time with such a majority as the
Seddon Government gained in ’93. All through
its career it has had to encounter the bitter
hostility of five-sixths of the city press and the
great majority of the press of the entire coun-
try. It has declared war against abuses which '
no previous Ministry dared to attack, and has
thereby incurred the bitter hatred of almost
every “ vested interest ” in the country. It
has taken risks which almost all the alleged
financiers of Australasia declared to be ruinous,
and has come out right in almost every case.
It has been a Labor and semi-Socialistic Go-
vernment, and has proved that a Labor Govern-
ment can be as peaceful and much more intelli-
gent than the ordinary variety ; and it has sent
printers and boiler-makers into the Upper
House, where they have revealed much more
capacity than the ordinary Fat Mttn nominee.
It has been much more honest than the average.
It hasn’t bought support with any lavish dis-
tribution of borrowed money—the means by
which Vogel and Gillies obtained their second
terms of office. And, despite the fact that it has
most of the press, most of the capitalistic in-
terest, the whole grog influence, and the Na-
tional Ass to contend with, the present signs
are that it will get another big majority and go
on to complete nine consecutive years of office.
If it does, it will show that the policy of trust
ing the people pays best in the long run.
A Bogus Surprise.
A grand display of newspaper-surprise was
submitted to the public of Smellbourne and Vic-
toria when the Lormer Enquiry Board found
magistrates Rapiport, Baxter, and Bird guilty
ot scandalously corrupt dealings. The astonish-
ment, although it made no claim to freshness,
was not supposed to date back further than the
lev elations ” made before the Board. Nothing
unfavorable to the characters of Rapiport and
axter had reached the offices of the
Kespectable —or “Great”—journals during
ie years previous to the exposure of these
calamitous law-givers, which came as a great
s ioc - to the community, said the various
right-minded news-sheets. In the face of all
-rj Us P ,et ended sorrow and amazement, The
Bulletin doesn’t - hesTtate~To~ affirm that
Rapiport and Baxter aforesaid (not to
Bird) have long enjoyed an
'V reputatl °n among Smellbourne journalists,
fawyeis, and “ round town” people of all
• ( nnl tipt i° ns ' eferences to the unsavoury pair
nnhlnlf' 1U r \ ese c °l umns long ago ; and'the
& lUl § dishonesty on the bench of other


Vic. magistrates, and the names of their
favorite haunts where they could usually be
found at certain hours ready to discuss business
with anybody who had a court-case coming on,
were already notorious matters at that time.
I he Raeiport-Baxtf.r combination was a
standing item in well-informed gossip circles,
and, seeing that all daily newspapers are in-
terested in police-court doings and corridor
whisperings, it goes without saying that many
of the revelations elicited by the Lormer
Enquiry Board might have been picked up in
Collins-st. at one time or other, and hurled at the
principal delinquents from an editor’s room.
True, there was a probability of the missiles
failing to lay “ Rappy ” and Baxter low. The
mere fact that the men could set scandal at
defiance for several years indicates a difficulty
in bringing typical Smellbournians to grief.
Motives of prudence can be urged in extenua-
tion of newspaper silence re the matters which
Mr. Lormer finally ventured to deal with. But
the hypocritical surprise expressed by the
newspapers when Lormer proved his case
was altogether contemptible and charac-
teristic of the city where a truthful tongue
is deemed a dangerous member. Nobody
who, in the cant acceptation of the words,
“ knew anything at all ” was ignorant of
the Rapiport -citra- Baxter business. Also,
nobody can help being quite well aware
that Smellbourne has supported at least one
professional jury-nobbier since it lost its con-
science in the hurly-burly of the boom. Un-
fortunately, a board of enquiry about him is
not likely to sit; but should, perchance, the
name of this notorious individual ever get
proclaimed aloud, he will occasion another
bogus ebullition of “surprise.”
Melbourne University—Yet Again.
Dear Bulletin, — Isn’t it about time that ill-
informed scribes gave up slinging ink at Melb.
University? “Demos” (March 21) asserts
several erratic things about the University, the
Affiliated Colleges, and the Masonic Lodge.
(1) “This impartial, State-supported institu-
tion (vide J.S. R.) shelters a whole brood of
theological colleges and a Masonic Lodge.”
(a) The University is not State-.s upported. It
receives State-oi(Z annually, but so do munici-
palities, shires, water-trusts, hospitals, lib-
raries, museums, art-societies, schools of mines
—yea, even cemeteries. But none of these
admit the world free—except, perhaps, the
cemeteries. ( b ) The Affiliated Colleges—
Trinity, Ormond, Queen’s —are not Univer-
sity-owned colleges. They are not Univer-
sity-governed colleges. They do net con-
tribute a cent to the University chest. The
University does not contribute a cent to their
coffers, (c). Nor are they theolorjiccd colleges.
Connected with each religious sect (or church)
is a theological hall to train its budding clerics.
But these halls are wholly self-governed, and
unrecognised by the University in any way.
These halls give theological instruction in the
college buildings—Anglican, Presbyterian, and
Wesleyan halls, that is—but they are no more
connected with the University than are, say,
the Congregational, Baptist, and R.C. halls
which give instruction miles away. The halls
do not, and never did, own or govern
Trinity, Ormond, or Queen’s, any more than
the University does or did. Again, the
three Affiliated Colleges are open to all-
comers without religious tests, and in them
there are no compulsory religious observances,
lu my time at Ormond (Presbyterian hall col-
lege) there were resident adherents of half-a-
dozen Protestant churches ; also, Unitarians,
Jews, Roman Catholics, and Agnostics, and a
present census would doubtless reveal the same.
These colleges are no more theolorjiccd colleges
than the British and Gennafi Universities are
theological Universities theological
instruction is therein given. They are simply
teaching institutions, with “ Divinity ” on their
programme for those who care for the subject.
(d) “ The colleges are built on the University
Reserve.” They are not. Away back in the
“ fifties ” a large block of land north of Mel-
bourne city was reserved by the then
Government for educational purposes. By
later Governments portions of this land
have from time to time been granted to
various bodies, viz., University, Public Library
Trustees, Anglican, Presbyterian, Wesleyan,
and R.C. Churches, Education and Defence
Departments, and some is still ordinary Crown
lands' reserves. Of the whole parcel of laud
which “ Demos ” seeks to style the “ University
Reserve,” only about one-third belongs to the
University, and it never held more than it does
now. (2) “ The Masonic Lodge spreads itself
in the official calendar.” It does not. I he
Masonic Lodge is simply looked on as an asso-
ciation of University men for a specific purpose,
just as the cricket-club is, or the Philosophical
Society. In the one solitary year (1893) in
which the lodge was mentioned in the calendar,
it received the same mention as the 11 other
societies then existent in the University —social,
educative, and athletic —so that it no mote
“ spread itself ” than, say, did the Princess Ida
(women’s) Club. If “ Demos ” knew more about
the University, he would probably talk less.
Yours truly, J.S.R. [This discussion ends
right here. If it were left to itself it would
evidently last out the century, and The Bulle-
tin is tired. —Ed. B.]
Sydney’s Meat Supply
Sydney is the second largest of Australian cities,
with a population of about 400,000 ; and practi-
cally the whole of the meat it consumes is killed
at abattoirs in the centre of one of its most
thickly-populated suburbs. A system more
dangerous to public health and life could hard y
be devised. Bullocks, wild and tame are
driven along the public roads by hundreds at
night-time and occasionally in the dav-time,
making residence or passage along the line of
route unsafe for- thousands of people. Acci-
dents occur frequently, and sometimes an in-
furiated animal has to be pursued and shot with
rifles in a main thoroughfare. The blood and
refuse from the abattoirs partly fester into the
harbor, and the water of Johnstone s Bay is so
polluted that no fish but sharks will enter it. In
addition, the killing of so many animals and the
exposure of so much offal creates a stink which
the wind carries for miles; and, lately, scores
of residents in the neighborhood have been
struck down by typhoid fever attributed
directly to infection from the abattoirs. Such
a combination of nuisances in any modern city
is a monstrous thing ; but there are many men
employed in connection with the abattoirs,
and houses and hotels in the neighborhood
are let in spite of its accumulation of
horrors. Hence a strong vested landlords’
interest absolutely opposes any change.
“ Let air and water be polluted,” they
say; “fill the streets with frantic cattle;
let the public health go hang ; but for Heaven’s
sake don’t drive away our tenants.” And so
well have they managed that Sydney in 1896
is as far behind in the matter of meat-supply
as it was 20 years ago. The Bulletin is glad
to see that Premier Reid shows a wobbling in-
clination to end the nuisance. Abattoirs in the
midst of a large population are intolerable.
There should be killing-centres adjacent to the
railway lines a substantial distance from Syd-
ney, whither stock could be easily conveyed ;
and the whole of the meat for the city’s con-
sumption should be slaughtered at these centres
under the close supervision of Govt, experts,
and chilled and forwarded by special trains to
the retailers. No other course can so well meet
the public convenience, or secure the public
health.
•—
Sydn ky Telegraph in a recent issue thus calmly
consigns N.S. Wales’s sugar-industry—which
supports about 1800 workers and their families
—to oblivion :
We have never attempted 'to disguise the fact that the
future of the cane-growers was seriously jeopardised by
the removal of the duties. It might possibly stand a
reduction of the duties by one-half, but their entire
removal will in the end result in the colony drawing its
supplies of cane sugar from more tropical localities. The
Premier, when the removal of the duties was decided
upon, dealt with the sugar duties exceptionally, because
the position was exceptional, and although a substantial
rise in the world’s sugar markets would alter the outlook
considerably, it would not, in the long run, prevent the
inevitable decadence.
The smash won’t be immediate because sugar-
cane lias to be planted two years before a crop
is taken off, and the cane that was put in the
ground in ’94 and ’95, when the duty was sup-
posed to be fixed, will yield a return in ’96 and
’97 and ’9B, despite fiscal changes. But if the
farmers see no prospect of a reversion to the old
tariff conditions, then there is no inducement
to plant new crops, and the industry will start
violently downhill about ’99 and become practi-
cally extinct a year or two thereafter.
Re the release of Staples, the awful Melbourne
bank swindler, whom the Judge sentenced to
the longest term the law allowed of, stating, as
he did so, that he was sorry he couldn’t make
it more, and whom the Solicitor-General re-
leased so unobtrusively that even his colleagues
in the Ministry didn’t hear of it till some
months afterwards, Melbourne Punch alleges
that dozens of influential prisoners are similarly
sneaked out of gaol every year. In Staples’s
case the matter would never have become
public if the lamented banker had le f t Mel-
bourne quietly and hadn’t gone obtrusively filing
his schedule ; and supposing the other prisoners
leave quietly and do not make a row
with their schedules no one is likely to hear
anything about them. Therefore no one really
knows who is in prison and who isn’t, or
whether the influential person ever serves his
sentence at all. If Parliament demanded a
complete list of the persons whose sentences
were commuted, say within the last ten years,
the result would probably make it hand over
the whole business to a Court of Appeal, which
would sit in public, and openly give its reasons
for the release of any prisoner before his time,
and to which the influential friends of the man
who has gone wrong would have to make their
application in the garish light of day.
A cornstalk person, signing himself “A. A.
Baker,” writes in the usual cornstalk frame of
mind to S.M. Herald about how to cure the
“ depression ” :
Now, it is my conviction that the solution of this-pro-
blem is to be" found, not in the fluctuating, reversible
policy of either Freetrade or Protection, such as we have
had hitherto, but in a definite, settled, fixed policy (to be
determined by the electors themselves by a plebiscite
vote) for a period of not less than 10 years. With this
question settled for that period the attention of capitalists
and investors and others (not only in this, but in other
lands') would be attracted to New South Wales as a place
affording encouragement and security for the investment
of their capital (which they have not hitherto had), and
which would undoubtedly result in the establishment of
those permanent industries and manufactories in our
midst which our natural resources demand should be
located here.
The truly awful thing about the cornstalk is
that his * first and last and only idea' about
removing the depression is to “attract foreign
capital into the country ” and to “ promote the
investment of English capital,” or some other
such wheeze. And his only idea of N.>S. \V.
manufactures is to have big factories put up
with English money and bossed by English-
men, and have the profits go to England, while
the common Australian does the hard grind at
30s. or 365. a week. If Australia is ever going
to be a nation it wants to begin by making it an
offence, punishable by death, to write or talk
or drivel any longer the old. platitudes about
“ attracting foreign capital ” and “ promoting
the investment of foreign capital in opening up
the resources of the country,” or “ encouraging
a steady influx of foreign capital,” or any other
of the stale catchwords that this country has
lived upon so long. There is already about six
times more foreign capital invested in Australia
in proportion to population than in any other
country on earth, and the result is so awful
that any man who wants more foreign capital,
and consequently more debt and more interest
to pay and more grind to pay it, needs prompt
execution.
If the Lormer Board’s strictures on Lormer
for adjudicating on licensing cases as a teeto-
taller are correct, then the Victorian Chief
Justice stands condemned for adjudicating in
divorce-cases while confessedly entertaining a
strong prejudice against the Shiels Divorce
Act. On similar grounds, the agnostic Judges
are ineligible for blasphemous-libel prosecutions.
Judge Hodges, as an anti-gambler, acts impro-
perly when he sits on a lottery, totalisator, stock-
exchange, or even insurance case ; and a Judge
who is over-friendly with a girl or two should
refrain from hearing maintenance and affiliation
cases. Judge Holroyd, as a believer in Imperial
Federation, should retire from any consti-
tutional case, or possibly from any case in
which Separationist Purves appears as counsel;
while any Judge who has a strong prejudice
against law-breaking and who is determined to
put it down as far as possible, should certainly
refrain from sitting in judgment on any law-
breaker, civil or criminal. For the honest
belief that one can act justly in spite of one’s
“list” does not relieve one from the charge of
“acting improperly.”
The Lormer Board report—terse, logical, and
conclusive as it is—threatens to ensure the con-
tinuance of the “ honorary ” magistracy in
country districts on the present basis. It went
out of its way to suggest doubts as to the Ben-
digo and Ballarat beaks, but rather eulogised
than otherwise the rest. This leaves many
sores untouched—the squatter-employer J.P.,
the dictator-storekeeper J.P., the Little Bethel
J.P., the mine-owner J.P., the boodling irriga-
tion-trust J.P., the Orange lodge J.P., and the
boss-cookie nuisance. As to the substitution of
a board for appointing justices for the present
system, it is almost certain that the Chief Jus-
tice would be a member, and it is very ques-
tionable whether the principle of social
flunkeyism would prove a more desirable
method of testing fitness than the present prin-
ciple of political flunkeyism. An extension of
the stipendiary system and the election plan
are the only really arguable proposals.
Fat Man Lewis, National Ass member for
Christchurch (M.L.), a few weeks ago :
One of the worst of the many had results of the Govern-
ment policy has been to attract to our shores the poor and
destitute of Australia.
Australian Star, National Ass organ in
Sydney, the other day :
In 1893 New Zealand’s excess of immigration over emi-
gration was 10,412. In 1894 Mr. Seddon’s policy was be-
ginning to tell its tale ; the immigration figures dropped
to 2253. The year 1895 saw the complete bursting of the
bubble, the immigration figures fell to 895 —0 r to 9517 less
than in 1893 ! Such figures would have opened the eyes
of any less blinded by passion, class-hatred, stubbornness,
and lust for office than Mr. Seddon and his colleagues. . .
Well-wishers of that colony will sincerely hope for the
downfall of one of the very worst Governments ever
known in an Australasian colony.
The Ass thus argues equally well either way.
When Lewis was orating, the immigration
figures for ’95 were not available; but it was
generally supposed that people were still stream-
ing in, and their coming showed that the
Seddon Government was very bad indeed.
When it transpired that immigrants hadn’t
been coming in so very largely, after all, that
fact showed that the Seddon Govt, was even
more wicked for not attracting them than it
had been for attracting them. And it was the
same doleful Ass each time.
There are sundry reasons for suspecting that
some, at all events —perhaps a good many—of __
the members of the Victorian House of 48
Bich Landlords hold their seats illegally, being
practically insolvent boomers who have not, in
their own right, anything like the necessary
qualification. The Victorian M. L.C. must be
possessed of an estate of the annual value of
,£lOO, and this presumably means that he must
be the absolute owner of it—not that it is lent
to him for the purpose of qualifying while the
title-deeds and transfer are in the hands of the
real proprietor, or that it is standing in his
name by any other legal fiction. Some of the
M.sL.C. are now commonly reported to be
busted and to be living on the charity and for-
bearance of some financial institution or other,
or keeping up appearances on the sufferance of
their creditors, and in some cases the pretence
that they really and truly own an estate of the
value of J>loo a year or anything near it is a
hopeless mockery. It would behighlyinteresting
to know if anybody seriously investigates the
position of members of the Council at occasional
intervals to see if they are qualified for their
positions according to law, or if their position
is examined by any independent authority when
they go up for election or re-election, or if they
simply travel on the bluff. If any .Democratic
organisation would quietly and thoroughly in-
vestigate the qualifications of the arrogant
Tories who last session threw out in a wholesale
fashion all the Democratic measures of the
Turner Government, some startling disclosures
would probably ensue. The Ministry, which
has a long score to settle with the House of
Fossils, might look into this matter with much
profit.
Sydney Telegraph, in its leading article of
March 20, sits heavily on the advance by the
State of seed-wheat to distressed farmers and
on the minimum-wage upon Government con-
tracts, on the ground that they are equally
opposed to the great “ terewths ” of Freetrade.
“ The especial desire of the people,” it says,
“ as communicated to the Government at the
ballot-boxes, was that class-legislation should
cease and class favors be abolished.” Yet our
contemporary hasn’t yet said one word about
the “class favor” by which the Telegraph is
carried free through the post, at the expense of
the taxpayer, all over N.S. Wales. “If the
farmer is not as capable of getting along by
himself as the butcher, baker, or blacksmith,
the consequences should be upon his own head,”
says the D.T. The same remark applies to the
newspaper. If it can’t compete with the
foreign paper unless a 50 per cent, duty is
placed on the latter in the shape of postage, it
ought to go bung. The distribution of seed-
wheat doesn’t cost the State half as much as
free newspaper-postage does ; moreover, it is
only a loan, and the money mostly comes back
again, while the free postage is a gift ; and the
distressed farmer only asks assistance once a
year at most, while the rich and prosperous
Telegraph is a protected and subsidised pauper
every day of its life.
The amount paid by Sydney clothing-factories
for “ slop-made ” trouseis ranges from lOd, to
as low as sd. per pair, “soaped, felled and
pressed, complete,” the work to be done at
home. Few establishments pay the maximum
price now, the general average being with
a tendency to get still lower down. Out of this
munificent sum the work-girl has to provide
her own needles, thread, &c., and the necessary
firing for the heating of the pressing-irons, be-
sides paying for machine-hire, repairs, oil and
incidentals. This, at a fair calculation, reduces
the 6£d.—-the average price—to about 6d., for
the making and delivery of each pair of
pants. And, even at this figure, the
worker can’t got anything like constant em-
ployment ! Further, when the wretched slave
has succeeded in securing a big order, she can’t
“ slum ” the work to make up for the enforced
idleness of yesterday, as the employer takes
each article in his fat-creased paws and, before
passing it for payment, gives it a great tug,
and, should a stitch start or crack, the white
slave has to trudge back garret-wards and there
unpick and do the work over again, at her own
cost, with loss of more thread, firing and time—
and loss, indeed, of everything save, alas ! an
unfailing belief in the alleged beneficial results
of Freetrade. And it is to compete with these,
and, consequently, still more reduce their
wages, that an English religious paper, the
British Weekly, urges the better-paid, or at
least equally-poorly-paid, sewing girl to come
along in boatloads to the Promised Land of
Botany Bay.
♦-
If a vestige of the N.S. \V. Custom House is to
remain, Protectionists and Freetraders should
make an opportunity in next Parliament for
amending the current Customs Act. That
portion of the Act which, instead of compel-
ling the criminal prosecution of a man guilty of
defrauding the Customs, expressly provides
that he may smother the charge by paying an
increased duty, should be hissed off the Statute
Book by a bulky majority. The fact that such
a provision exists in the Act and was unknown
until lately by prominent members of the
Executive, proves with what cunning that piece
of legislation was engineered through Parlia-
ment in the good old days which preceded pay-
ment of members.
The Australasian (the weekly echo of the
Argus) still harps on the story that the Vic-
torian Companies Bill was thrown out, not
because the 48 Rich Landlords wanted to pre-
serve the old, profitable abuses, but for want of
time. “ With regard to the Companies Bill,”
it wails, “ does Mr. Deakin think the last day
of the session the proper time to send up a
measure making important alterations in the
law?” Of course not. But, then, the Companies
Bill was sent to the Council more than a week
before that date. The Tory organ, of course,
doesn’t actually allege that the Bill wasn’t sent
up till the last day of the session ; it. merely
asks w'ildly if a certain date, upon which a
thing didn’t happen, was the sort of date when
a thing like that should have happened. And
The Bulletin, with a view to being quite as
much to the point, asks if the last day of the
session was a proper time for the editor of the
Australasian to go out with a black eye and
fish for the sea serpent in the Yarra with a
crooked pin and a worm? Which doesn’t imply
that he did anything of the kind ; it merely
raises the question whether, supposing a thing
that didn’t occur had occurred on a certain
occasion, that would have been a good occasion
for it to occur upon ? And that is just what
the Australasian is asking.
——-
Last Saturday’s Q. elections are a horse of
another color—the color the Govt, has been
cunningly trying to keep dark. Of 22 seats the
Labor-party took 12—gaining three on its pre-
vious holding. The strength of parties is now
estimated—Govt., 38; Labor, 19; Opposition,
6 ; Independent, 3. There are still six consti-
tuencies to poll. At Toowoomba, Oppositionists
Groom and Fogarty got in by a large majority,
beating both Govt, and Labor men. At
Cairns, ' the Labor candidate was beaten
by the alleged nominee of Burns, Philf
and Co. Charters Towers re - elected its
old Labor members, and Ministerialist Sayers
was again decisively beaten. Kidston, a
moderate Democrat, siding with Labor, headed
the poll at Rockhampton ; and Drake gave
Mayor Thurlow a drubbing at Enoggera.
Attorney-General Byrnes took his toga right
off, and .. after suggest ing retirement from
politics, and. regretting that he had been
nominated without his consent at Warwick,
and trumpeting his stern refusal to aceept a
seat at the expense of another Ministerialist,
permitted a Ministerialist to retire in his favor
and went in easily.'
A person calling himself “ Tenax ’" whoops in
the columns of the Age. Said whoop is worth
notice as an example of the common state of
the Victorian intelligence :
I wish, through your columns, to ask the democrats of
this country how much longer they propose to suffer the
action of the Legislative Council. That body has filled
up the cup of its iniquities by eliminating from the Fac-
tories Bill almost every proposition which would make
the measure a real protection to the workers. Yet there
is no method of overcoming such obstruction save by the
Government taking the sense of the country. No better
issue could be chosen. An enormous majority of voters
will decide against the Upper House and in favor of im-
prisonment for sweating on the third conviction, of regu-
lation of the hours of labor, and of strict limitation and
close inspection of out-door work. Then there is, &c., &c.
The Vic. elector returns Sargood and Zeal and
the other snags to the Upper House, yq£ir after
year, generally without even a contest ; a
hundred Assembly elections can’t influence that
body so long as the country won’t interfere
with it at Council elections ; and yet the great
aggregate elector who has re-elected Sargood
persistently for 22 years wants to know why
the Ministry doesn’t “do something” to shift
him. What is the good of asking the Govern-
ment to “ take the sense of the country ” when
the sense of the country—or of the great
bulk of it —is that Sargood is to be
in power for 22 years ? Sargood is the
sense of the country, so far as it has been ex-

Bland Holt opened his season at Sydney
Royal with a very promising military drama
named, apropos of nothing at all, “ One of the
Best. ’ I’he military element concerns an alleged
Highland regiment, which gives somebody an ex-
cuse to come on and blow a fearsome blast on the
haggis or the usquebaugh or the philabeg or some
other instrument that looks like a goat’s-hair
football with several nozzles to it. There is no
war in the drama ; not a single gun goes off; and
the enemy doesn’t get routed even once. Also,
there is hardly a single allusion to the glorious
Flag. The trouble turns entirely on the fact that
Baker is convicted of taking important military
secrets out of the safe at night and selling them to
the enemy, when it is really Cosgrove who has
entered the gate secretly with a baleful sneer
and done it. Therefore, Baker is sentenced to
penal servitude for life and is stripped of his
decorations in the presence of 400 troops, the
process being carried out so effectually that he re-
tires to his dungeon cell with very little on save
his petticoat. Then things begin to move sud-
denly, Cosgrove being unmasked and rushed off
the stage for good inside 3u minutes, and the show
closes with Baker reinstated and waving a flag.
The drama goes so smoothly and is adorned with
such a quantity of gorgeous Highlander that the
extreme suddenness and want of finish in the last
act are less noticeable than they might be.

Bland and Mrs. Holt are the comic element
of the show, said comedy consisting largely of
ladies’ stockings, and complaints about Bland’s
petticoat and allusions to infants. Some kind
remarks are called for about Mrs. Holt’s appear-
ance in bicycle costume. That lady makes an
exceedingly nice boy, and her knickerbockers are
a poem. Also, she is a good deal of a poem all
round, as she always is. Baker, as the hero, is
just about perfect, and even the awful kilts can’t
wreck his fine impersonation of a very fine char-
acter. Concerning the new star, Miss Elizabeth
Watson, sister of Henrietta with the swan neck,
The Bulletin suspends its judgment and regret-
fully hangs the lady up for further consideration.
She is strong in spots and weak in spots, and
vaguely unsatisfactory in spots ; but, possibly,
many of these spots will disappear later on.
As for Miss Frances Ross, this paper implores
her to put the awful skirt she wears in
act 111. into the ash-barrel, and the remainder of
the dress in the coal-hole, and to shove the hat up
the chimney as far as it will go, and stick to her
other two graceful costumes. No beauty could
stand the awfulness of the frock in act 111. As
regards the contents of the frock, Miss Ross is g,
graceful actress, who is good in her tender
moments and weak in her tragic ones, but the
writer has an impression so far that she is capable
of better things—provided she keeps the aforesaid
costume well up the chimney. Also, he desires to
say something really good about Charles Brown,
Corlesse, and Harford, and to record his conviction
that Miss Flora Anstead is one of the best old
women—old in a stagey sense—going.

The Brough-Boucicault co. started its fare-
well season at Sydney Cri. amid much enthusiasm
and a very large quantity of vegetables. “ The
Pickpocket ” was put up for two nights only, and
a large audience noted with interest certain
developments in that pleasant comedy since its
last appearance in Sydney. Boucicault has made
his waiter older and more tottersome in the legs
than he used to be, and he scoots across the stage
with less than his old velocity. What'he has lost
in this way, however, he has gained in the comic
rheumatism of his left leg, and the hilarious
flunkey is as hilarious as ever. Ward lurks on
the right side of the stage now while watching his
suspected wife, whereas he used to lurk on
the left. Brough takes Anson’s old part
as the grumpy invalid, and The Bulle-
tin hasn’t quite made up its mind which
grumpy person it likes best. Titheradge is the
same to a hair as he was before, while somehow
Miss Hilda Spong falls comparatively flat as the
g sh ul bride. Taking it in all its aspects, the
“Pi ntpQcket” is almost, though not quite, as
brignt as it used to be. By the time these remarks
appear in print, however, Hawtrey’s comedy will
be gone, and “Rebellious Susan” and “Dandy
Dick ” will also have made a. transient appearance
and passed away again, and “Mrs. Tanqueray”
Will be just due. “The Importance of Being
Earnest,” by Oscar Wilde, who is just now busy
showing the importance of being in gaol, will be
staged on Saturday, and this paper hopes to dis-
course extensively thereon next week.

The Full Court, or the partially-empty
court, or some other authority, having injuncted
the production of “ Called to Arms ” at Her
Majesty’s, and used very considerable language
about the management, that production had to be
abandoned at the last moment, and the three big
guns moulder uselessly in the vestibule. “ Hands
Across the Sea” was shunted on the stage in great
haste to fill the gap. “ Hands ” hasn’t improved
since The Bulletin had the pleasure of making
many nasty remarks about it in bygone times, nor
has it got any worse. It still embodies the usual
tired feeling about the “ Old Flag,” and the lead-
ing character is in the same feverish state of whoop
about how the banner of his country will protect
him from the beastly foreign aggressor. When
the foreign aggressor gets too beastly the banner
is hoisted and the aggressor sees it and recognises
that the game is up and departs with his tail in
the dust. “Hands,” taking it all round, is
a very ordinary melodrama, and the author’s
attempt to hang on at the end an irrelevant
moral to the effect that this country should
be deeply attached to the hempire, and that Hing-
land is older than other places, and that the Union
Jack isn't so new as history says it is, and that
the Hinglishman’s blood is more ancient than the
average, is fortunately drowned by the rush of the
audience for its tram. There is no public enthu-
siasm about “Hands” just at present. The
scenery is remarkably good, considering the red-
hot haste with which the piece was put up. Miss
Lilia Wilde’s heroine is a very nice and creditable
girl in a pretty frock, and the rest of the co. is as
successful as could be expected under the circum-
stances.

“Djin-Djin” has consistently filled the
Lyceum to overflowing all the week. The stranger
who was keeping holiday in Sydney has gaped
with an exceeding great gape at the illuminated
city of Nagasaki, and the frozen forest, and the
earthquake, and the eruption, and the golden city,
and all the rest of the blaze and blare and frescoed
howl, and pronounced it good. All the week the
Lyceum has rung with the whack of his horny
palms, and the old man who has gone on the land
went away at last with a stunned expression to
the gum-trees and the salt-bush, and said “ My
oath ’’ frequently. For a holiday spectacle “ Djin
Djiu ” fills the bill to perfection. The person from
the plains wants something that is as little like
the sluggish cow and the taciturn calf as possible,
and the three hours of irresponsible riot and glory
supplied at the Lyceum probably satisfy the empty
places in his soul better than anything else could.
He doesn’t really crave for dramatic art; what he
is after is surprise and paint and yell and illumi-
nation. and they are all there.

Harry Rickards and Alice Leamar reap-
peared at Sydney Tivoli, and that house has been
running a constant series of matinees to satisfy
the public demand for more Rickards and more
Alice than can be crowded into an ordinary
evening performance. The Opera House remains
distinctly alive, and a new minstrel co. broke out
at the Music Hall. Also, small two-night shows,
too numerous to mention, raged in all parts of
the city to absorb the overflow from the big
theatres, and The Bulletin gave up all hope of
trying to overtake the rush.

Mr. Alfred Woods, of Her Majesty’s
Theatre, Sydney, had a hot time in court in
the matter of Bland Holt’s application for an
injunction to restrain him from producing a drama
entitled “ Called to Arms,” on the ground that it
was an infringement of “For England,” the
colonial rights for which he (8.H.) had purchased
from Sutton Vane, the author. In delivering
judgment, the Court said that there was no doubt
the two plays were practically the sa ™ e ’
incidents of the plot, and the details°f
dents, were the same; and as tho play wasor ?
nally prepared for represen cation, the names M the
dramatis persona; were also identic a . . , °
that plaintiff was about to dispute the i ght to
produce “Called to Arms,’ defendant appeared
to have made some attempt at altering 1 ‘J\
The names of the dramatis persona were variet ,
and, although the sense of all the Passage.
“Called to Arms” remained, as far as he ki ,
identically the same as in the play lor L o ’
the language in some of them had been channe l.
It appeared to him, therefore, that this was not
merely an ordinary infringement, but one of a.very
b irefaced kind, that was assuming that plaintiff was
able to establish his rights at the hearing,
therefore granted the injunction until the heani g ,
but, as he had to act upon more or less imperfect
evidence, he would make the costs costs in tr
cause.

The touch of grovel perceptible in Bouci-
cault’s benefit-night speech was much more marked
on the closing night of the Melb. season, when he
had to return thanks for a cheque. Clever Dion B.
is Irish, and centuries of oppression have produced
grovel in the Irish blood. Paddy is as ready to
fawn as to fight, and Lord ! how he delights to
butter one of his shamrock brethren. Witness
Chief Justice Madden’s eulogium of the unique
stage-manager,” and vice versa.
Westmacott’s Co. began to appear at Melb.
Royal on Saturday, and made a favorable im-
pression upon a crowded house. 1 The Enemy s
Camp,” late of Sydney, has already been referred
to by this journal as a deserving melodramatic
howl in many acts. It contains a larger amount
of unsophisticated plot to the square foot than any
two ordinary screams,- and is so full of stirring
incidents, and expensive scenery, and black-
hearted crime that no ordinary intellect can take
it all in at one sitting. Also, “The Enemy’s
Camp ” is sometimes a military spectacle, trimmed
with comic songs and a saucy ballet, in addition
to which the villain wears a red sash', and the
legs of the long - lost father are encased
in top boots,
and all the
other leading
characters are
required to act
up to their
gaudy attire.

Gabbett, and the raw flesh of the Moocher,
were withdrawn from Melb. Alexandra last Week,
owing to clever Dora Mostyn’s departure oh a
provincial Easter tour. The Haleck Company,
minus Dora aforesaid, is just now strugglirtgnian-
fully with H. J. Byron’s old play, “ The Lan-
cashire Lass,” which, in its time, was a good play,
and is still a respectable sample of stage literature!
If they could remove a couple of acts, and fill up
the gap with convicts and cannibalism, it would
be more appreciated by Dan. Barry's constituency,
but even under present conditions “ The Lan-
cashire Lass” is well received. For one thing;
the heroine suffers from a lot of unjust suspicion
and misdirected abuse. Nothing seems to please
a sixpenny gallery much better than an
innocent female, staggering under a load of sorrow.
But Augustus Glover, as a Party by the name of
Johnson, is the actual first favorite. Augustus
puts vigor and humor into his wickedness, and
carries a yard of dirty red handkerchief protruding
from a greasy trousers pocket, and turns up like a
bad penny to embitter the existence of a bloated
capitalist who is afraid to chuck him off the
premises because he has “ proofs ” of the b.c.’s
early indiscretion concealed about his person.
The idea of this gruesome object making the con-
science-stricken millionaire quake in his ponderous
frock-coat, and bri lging beads of perspiration to
the rich man’s brow, is so eminently satisfactory,
especially at popular prices, that “ The Lancashire
Lass ” will certainly flourish for a week or more.

The coming of sundry new people from
Sydney, likewise the first production of Charles
Godfrey’s sketch, “ The Night Alarm,” caused a
great rush to Melb. Opera House on Saturday.
Taken in the bulk, the new arrivals proved to be
brighter—anyhow, they were fresher —than those
who made way for them. Godfrey’s sketch, or
“ dramatic scene,” or whatever it calls itself, was
also a success in its last moments, when the fire-
bed rang, and the lion-hearted comedian drove
away on a real engine to save his family from
being burnt alive in the next scene. A couple of
maudlin dirges leading up to the Conflagration
were very tiresome, however. The sin get had
had a bad day at the races, it appeared, and alow-
spirited punter warbling low-spirited doggerel
verses at a funereal pace is about as painful as the
income-tax.

The stage version of “ Trilby ” introduced
to Australia at Melb. Princess’s on Easter Mon-
day will satisfy people who Compare it with the
book, whilst capturing the vote and interest of the
uninitiated. It is a poetic melodrama built around
the weird figure of Svengali, the musician and
hypnotist. Pale-blue limelight gleams upon the
countenance of that fatal hybrid Hebrew, and the
creature is a strange reality. Also, he dies in a
convincing manner, failing backward across a gilt
table with an awful white face staring at the
audience to remind them that all flesh is grass.
The Svengali of the story is intensified on the
stage ; his influence over Trilby .e^n-be felt", and
the sensation of it surviveiThls decease in the third
act. The performance of Reuben Fox in this
chief character is a striking success, far beyond
general expectation.
* * * *
Miss Edith Crane makes a fine figure of a
Trilby, and does all things gracefully ; but her
brief love-scenes are marred by a tame, mechani-
cal, unprepossessing little Billee whose blighted
career seems a just reward for Ins unnatural acting.
The Laird is likewise open to improvement. Five
or six other imported artists fit their parts well,
the exponents of Geeke, Madam Vinard, and Zou
Zou being particularly right up to the mark.
Veteran H. R. Harwood upholds the credit of
local talent in the character of Rev. Thomas Bagot,
a shepherd who apologises for wantinsr to save
Trilby from the wrath to come when, he learn;
that the Prince of Wales has been enqfiiriug alter
her health.
« * * *
As a matter of course, the play is smartly
mounted and managed; incidental music and
dancing give valuable assistance, and some by-play
expressing the devotion of the three English
painters to their young girl makes a pretty studio
picture. A “ Trilby ” matinee is announced for
Saturday.

The Comic Opera Co. opened in Adelaide
on Easter Saturday with “ The Yeomen of the
Guard.”
The programme of the Reid Goverment
for next session includes a large scheme of water
conservation, the construction of light railways,
a Referendum Bill, a measure to regulate alien
labor, the amalgamation of the savings banks
(whereby G. R. Dibbs may lose his present com-
fortable billet), law-reform, a Coal Mines Bill, and
a few smaller measures. Nothing definite has
been said, so far, about reform of the Council or
Local Government, and the latter, at all events,
seems hopeless for the present. Local Govern-
ment in N.S.W. has been stranded for 30 years
n ?"j , an< l Parliament has almost lost the habit
of thinking about it.

The Farmers’ Mutual Loan and Building
Society, whose prospectus appears in Melbourne, is an
affair which, if honestly and intelligently worked, should
fill a large want. It is to some extent an extension of the
Starr-Bowkett principle. There are to be issued 5000
shares of £6O each payable by instalments of ss. per share
per month, so that the capital should ultimately reach
£-300,000. This money is to be lent out to members on
the security of farm and orchard properties, creameries,
&c. Apparently, the funds as accumulate are
to be divided in two equal parts. A ballot will be
held periodically, and the winner gets his loan abso-
lutely free from interest and re-payable at the rate of
£6 per £lOO per annum. If a member ?an’t wait for his
chance of winning a ballot he may gef.a loan out of the
other half of the funds at 4£ per cent, per annum, also re-
payable by instalments, so that a payment of £7 per
annum for each £lOO horrowed ( will extinguish principal
and interest in 23 years. As the average lender charges
at least 7 per cent, for interest alone, this is a great con-
cession.
The unaccountable features of the arrangement
are that half the total repayments for the first four years
are to be invested in Vic. State securities, which will
somewhat diminish the lending fund, and that all the net
profits are to be similarly invested at the end of each
year. Therefore, so far as appears from the published
p ospectus, the fund available for loans will never get any
bigger, while the reserve invested in Government securi-
ties will grow steadily larger and larger, until, in course of
time, it should be a larger concern than the loan-fund.
The society is, apparently, intended to be a permanent
affair, and if it goes on for ever, and all the profits
are put away in State securities, there can’t be
any dividends, and in that case the shareholder who
doesn’t want to borrow at all, or who has repaid his
loan and doesn’t want another one, or who has sold his
property and has nothing to borrow on, will get nothing
out of it. Then, presumably, he must sell his shares to
someone who wants to borrow, for a document entitling a
man to a share in a prosperous fund which keeps accumu-
lating, and is never divided, and so can’t be got at, is
not saleable for mere purposes of investment. Should
the society prosper, a time may come when it will still
have its £300,000, or rather less, to invest in loans, and
£1,000,000 put away in State securities, and the reserve
will keep accumulating while the loan-fund remains the
same, and, though each share represents £6O of loan-fund
and £2OO of reserve, it will still only be worth £6O, for the
reserve seems to tie put away so securely that even the in-
terest on it can’t be lent out. This looks like needlessly
reducing the advantage to members —unless the society’s
advt. doesn’t fully explain things.
The Bulletin suggests the following as an
amended policy for such a society : (1) Capital, £3,000,000
in 60,000 £5O shares, payable at ss. a month, or as much
faster as the shareholder pleases ; (2) Each holder to have
as many shares as he likes, but nothing over ten shares to
carry any voting privileges; (3) Loans never to exceed 60
per cent, of the value of property ; (4) Loans to share-
holders on country lands to have preference ; loans to
shareholders on city lands to rank next; funds not in
demand by shareholders to be lent to non-shareholders on
country lands, or if such securities are not available, on
city property; (5) Interest 4i per cent. ttFshareholders;
6 per cent, to non-shareholders; all loans repayable by
annual instalments, with the option of paying in
full at any time; (6) Annual State audit to be pro-
vided for by special Act of Parliament; (7) Half the net
profits to go in dividends, and the other half to a reserve-
fund invested in Government securities ; (8) No director
to be a borrower, except on the certificate of the State
auditor that his security is up to the fixed standard.

“Insurer”: This paper knows nothing tangible
to the discredit of your office or any leading assurance
office of this country. But what it does know is that the
private-audit system has fallen into considerable < is-
credit, and that until there is some effectual State super-
vision there will be a vague suspicion in the minds of
many people about good and bad institutions alike.
State audit ought to be agitated for by all the leading life
societies of Australasia, simply because it provides an in-
dependent guarantee and one which the public can under-
stand. The fact that the auditors are elective officers
doesn’t guarantee their efficiency—as witness many ex-
ploded banks and other institutions. Therefore, even an
office which wants the n o t rigorous inspection can’t
get an auditor’s certificate which will keep it above sus-
picion, simply because the private auditor is in bad odour
at present, and justly so. •
The Australian Mutual Investment and Build-
in"- Co. (Svdne.v) is a beautiful relic of the dead boom.
The liabilities ‘at 31st December, ’95, are set down at
£315,249, and the assets have a book-value of £116,565.
Last’ year’s losses were, on paper, about £lOO,OOO,
but they were merely the vanishment of certain paper
values which had long ceased to have any real exist-
ence. Most of these consisted of Sydney city properties with
mortgages upon them, which properties had depreciated
so much that the co. either handed them back free, or
paid the mortgagees to take them away and say no more
about them or about the £90,000 or so which the co. paid
for them in the mad old days. The entire receipts last
year from £116,000 worth of alleged property appear to
have been £958, equal to about seventeen shillings per
cent, per annum all round, which was barely suffi-
cient to cover office expenses. One of the assets,
by the way, reads, “Probable loss, £958 3s. 2d.,” which
is a quaint affair. Five vears ago this concern issued a
balance-sheet setting forth that it had a reserve-fund of
£46 000 and £555,000 worth of assets: it had £353,,000 of
deposits at that time, and it paid 25 per shent. dividends
to its shareholders. The last 25 per shent div. was de-
clared in June, ’9l, and on that date the old board made
its verv last whoop about the glorious progress of the co.,
and verv shorllv after it took in its last deposit and un-
obtrusively closed its door. Nobody seems to have
inquired about it very hard since then.
The Federal Coffee Palace, that tall, gaunt
buildin"- which looks down out of the clouds on the
hitn"TV idesolation of Melbourne, reports from its pinnacle
thatT thfhgs are reallv getting better. Last half-years
income was £BO5O, and the expenditure £8307, so that the
loss was only £‘237. For the previous ha f the loss was
£702 and the one before it was £748 , theiefore, it is
believed that the great white elephant is now looking up
and may yet be a paying concern again. +
The Bank of England five years ago adopted a
scheme for making small investments in State securities,
which device would bear transplanting to Australia. Any
one can deposit a sum of money with the bank fixed for a
certain number of years. These sums are invested in
consols: the interest as it conies in is re-mvested : and so
the money goes on accumulating without any possible
risk to tlie investor and without any trouble whatever,
phe charges are Id. in the £ commission for collecting
and reinvesting the dividends—say, lid. a year on a 1400
investment —and 3d. for a letter every half-year reporting
the state of the balance. A scheme like this should do
we “ in Australia, when there is a State Bank to work it.

, According to one of the auditors of the City of
Melbourne Bank his duties as an auditor consisted in
cbeckin}; the arithmetical correctness of the figures
supplied by the officers of the bank and calling the
manager s attention to certain accounts. Auditors had
no control over the directors, and any remarks the
auditors ntade as to particular accounts were only sug-
gestions.” What is the exact value of an auditor who
not only has no control over the directors, but is as a
matter of fact dependent for his b'llet on the directors?

Loader had voluntarily retired from the Board
of the Mutual Life Assurance Co. (Vic.) before Tiib Bul-
letin commented, in a tone of horror, upon that dis-
credited financier’s candidature for re-election. The fact
remains that newspaper “ feelers ” re Loader’s chance of
hanging on to his billet were thrown out subsequent to
the City of Melbourne Bank revelations. He didn’t retire
untfithe voioes j n rh e street had made remarks which
left him no hope of be n r able to slip back to the Board
unobserved. As a di ector of the Mutual Life Co. he
showed himself a good business man, and was esteemed
by his colleagues, it is said ; nevertheless, the mere pro-
posal to maintain the name of Loader in bold type upon
the balance-sheets was a melancholy instance of official
opinion re Smellbourne’s indifference to scandal. In any
other civilised circle the utter “ impossibility ” of Loader
in such a connection would have been recognised by him-
self and his best friends long before he finished his C. of M.
Bank story of the awful things he couldn’t remember.
The ideal song for busted bank directors:
“ ’Twere folly to remember, 'tis wiser to forget.”
“Employers free” is becoming the familiar rule
at Melb. labor offices.

Much jumping of valuable property has of
late taken place in and around Sydney. One wealthy
citizen has just caused notices to lie served on a
host of his bewildered tenants asking them if they
have any title to the properties for which they
have, for years, been paying rent to bis agent.
This possibly as a preliminary to establishing a
“possessory title,” on a 20-years’ possession, which the
landlord has just completed. Of course, having once
paid rent to his agent, the tenants have acknowledged
the circulariser as their landlord, a fundamental principle
of law between landlord and tenant being that no tenant
can question his landlord’s title. But why does not some
democratic member bring in a Bill abrogating all future
attempts to establish possessory titles and vesting in the
State all properties for which no proper title can be pro-
duced ?

Q. Sugar Works Guarantee Act. Amount voted
by I’aiTanient, 0500,000. Total amount of approved
applications, £536,400. In ’95 two mills were crushing
under the Act; eight are to be ready for the season of
’96. Sixteen companies are at work under the Act,
14**,030 acres being mortgaged as security to the Govt.
Actual amount of money advanced up to date is £121,500
for erection of mills, tramways, etc. Contracts for 10
mills let up to date, of which five, costing £154,'000, went
to Maryborough, which has just gratefully returned two
Govt, supporters. Guaranteed mills to be ready for ’96
season will be capable of turning out 41,500 tons of sugar
per annum, the produce of 332,000 tons of cane. * As cane

these newly-fledged benefactors of the dairying com-
munity, and predict unpleasant developments. Already

There is, at least, one unwilling shareholder in
the Commercial Bank who might dispute his “calls ” lia-
bility with some hope of success. The aggrieved party in
question bought 100 shares on the market a week previous
to the Thursday when the old bank turned off its cash at
the meter. On which day the Board, having already
decided to put the business into liquidation and launch
the reconstruction scheme that lay drafted on the official
table, solemnly approved the transfer of those lno shares
20 minutes before closing-time. It was just a case of an
admittedly insolvent firm taking in a new partner with its
dying breath. » » .

N S W. Railway authorities are nothing if not
opportunist. Some months ago a big Sydney firm erected
a lar"-e advt. on a private site, and facing the line, near a
suburban station. Soon after it was up, the firm had a
letter from the Estates Branch asking for rent for the
advt., otherwise another hoarding would be erected in
front of it. The owners of the advt. didn’t see it in the
same li'dit, so a hoarding was erected in front of it—shut-
tinl' them out. Determined not to be beaten, the firm is
busilv engaged in overtopping the screen, and the railway
people in preventing them. As a small hoarding close to
the carriage-windows will hide a much bigger one a short
distance away, the railway people have all the odds on
their side. ,
A ,£.‘>o,ooo action is pending over the City of

A Sydney syndicate is opening the old Solferino

B.H. North sounded the praises of its concen-
trating plant and the makers thereof somewhat pre-
maturely. A dispute with the contractors has led to
temporary stoppage of work. In the mine, most in er st
now attaches to the prospecting at 500 ft. for the Jui ct >n
western “ make.” Prospects are fair ; that is to say, ,h ;y
have a lode formation which, though in itself unpayable,
carries blotches of sulphides and much coppery stuff.
Elsewhere the ore isn't very big.
Block 14 still puts through its mill about 2000
tons of crude ore weekly, and maintains an excellent
regularity which would have twice as much praise if the
stock were the plaything of a certain firm. This firm’s
interest in Norths and Souths seems to have a wonderful
effect upon the reports in most of the city papers con-
cerning those mines.
• • • •
Some of the reports upon which the B.H.
Bonanza was floated were written in days when silver was
about a third higher, and when boom-champagne still
flowed. Nevertheless, though “the crowd” is not the
most reliable, the prospects are just moderate. There
may be a vein branching from the main 8.11. lode —
possibly same that occurs in rich patches in the Consols,
further on. But at present the thing is absolutely a pro-
specting venture, and a pretty long shot at that. The
claim is certainly not an abandoned sulphide body to
which a new value has been given by recent mechanical
and other discoveries. The payable ore, whatever its
character, has yet to be found—just as it has to be in the
North Central, where the reports of “ hard country rock”
are already beginning to tire shareholders.

The manager of the Walter Scott mine. N.S.W.,
has resigned. He is said to have a good opinion of the

holder, hopes they will accept an offer of ±25,000.

There is a lot of changing about among mining-
managers. The sorrowful part of a manager’s life is to
wrestle with a poor mine, and to follow a man who has
proved it poor. In nine cases out of ten a manager
leaving a mine is pritna fade evidence that it should be
left by the shareholders as well. The Hong Kong G.M.
Co., Mt. M‘Donald, N.S.W., “has changed its mining-
manager, and intends now to pursue a vigorous mining
policy.” It is mournful to remember that many thou-
sands were paid for this show ; some £1(1,OOlt was spent
in machinery and in the mine, which has been worked
with poor results since the day it was acquired, some six
years ago.
* * * *
More good things predicted for the Hill End
field, and as these predictions have been going on for the
last 15 years, the public are very tired, and would not
believe anything from Hill End until the gold was in the
bank.

Stated that ,£15,000 and a quarter interest has
been given for the Totten Estate, in the vicinity of the
Wentworth mine, N.S W., and a heap of money is about
to be spent to prove which way the lode is trending. It
isn’t a lode—never was and never will be one. It is simply
a contact-joint between two formations—serpentine and
diorite, which is filled with rich ore occasionally. The
area of its richness is indicated by the surface, where an
enormous quantity of gold was obtained within a quarter
of a mile. This and a great deal more is embraced by the
Wentworth mine, and the whole of their gold has been
found within the alluvial area. The chance of finding
rich gold in any estate outside is remote. The only co.
that seems to have a show is the D’Arcv Wentworth, in-
asmuch as the contact-joint underlies into it. Already
it has been proved to pass out of one part of the Went-
worth mine at a depth of about 600 ft.
* * • *
The lucky Great Cobar tributors managed, it is
said, to buy up a deal of the mine’s stock before public
attention was drawn to the prosperity of their venture.

Mail to The Bulletin from Loudon:—“The
Westrallan boom has certainly burst, and there is very
little doing here in any of the shares. A few W. A. co’s
were brought out recently, hut only working capital was
subscribed, and that was done privately. One co. came
out last week, but it did not get enough applications to
pay for advertising. The public isn’t coming in at all.
The few good things at Hannan’s will be so overshadowed
by funerals elsewhere as to be quite unable to create an-
other boom.”
* * * *
The Coolgardie newspaper correspondents have
another foreign savant to play with— Oapt. Leoni, “who,
it is understood, holds an official position under the
Italian Government.” He has examined the Mt. Lovett
mine, and, of course, found it of unmistakable richness.
Says there are thousands of tons fit for a battery, and the
gold is not patchy or on the top. The cabled statement
that Herr Schmeisser favorably compares Coolgardie field
with the Rand should whoop things up a lot; but it will
put no gold into the scores of claims for which the English
have paid countless thousands and which are already
proven duffers.
Another hideous catastrophe has fallen over
Coolgardie. It had four or five inches of rain, “all the
dams are full, there is plenty of water for six months, it is
said, all the batteries are going to work full time, and a
bi" increase in the gold output may be looked for.” Un-
fortunately, several other things will happen. Within
six weeks we shall hear of a great lack of water. Many of
the batteries around Coolgardie, if they start at all, will
close down as soon as they clean up, and prove the un-
doubted barrenness of many apotheosised claims. A few
small rich parcels may be put through, but, with people
havin<>' any mining sense, they only prove the field in the
vicinity of Coolgardie to be a rank duffer, where there is
not a lease in a hundred that will pay to work.

Tom Hall and W. K. D’Arcy are promoting a
Westralian co., which is bound to float on the strength of
their names alone, remarks Tim Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent. There are probably 150 mines ready to be
launched on the market when the boom comes—mostly
verv bad ones. Still, though there will be a plethora of
wild cats, anything good will be successful if placed in
proper hands. * * »
Westralian gold output for February is esti-
mated at 17,9220 z. Even allowing for the fact that Feb-
ruary is the shortest month of the year, if this is to be the
average all through IS9O things will be a shade worse
than they were last year.
* * * *
Sydney D.T. remarks that the Great Boulder
2ooft level was started over five months ago, and that
shareholders, apropos of the late big jump in prices, are
entitled to know whether the gold has just been found
or whether it has been followed all the time.
• * * *
The Bulletin has been reading-up the back-files
of the Eastern daily press, and finds that within the last
two years or so exactly 28,937 mines have been found
in Westralia containing formations of from 3ft. to 700 ft.
wide and averaging between 6oz. and 19cwt. of gold per
ton of dirt. So far, not one of these mines has been
reported in any wire as having crushed a full 2 icwt. of
stone to the ton ; and, as at some time or other of its de-
velopment, each of the mines had at grass (as per “ our
own correspondent ”) between 200 and 7000 tons of quartz,
or "old slightly mixed with quartz, it follows that there
must be on hand in Westralia, in a more or less raw state,
scores of thousands of tons of gold. Under these circum-
stances the price of gold must necessarily fall below that
of zinc at an earl v date. The Bulletin, therefore, strongly
cautions all and sundry to beware of giving more than
tuppence for the best and newest of sovereigns.
Said that Zeb. Lane will float two of the Great
Boulder blocks into a subsidiary co. while in London.
The publication of the statements made recently
n Adelaide at a meeting of the members of the Cooljrardie
Prospecting Association is causing considerable anxiety
in certain Westralian quarters. An investigation is
demanded to find out who received the secret-service
money, and how much. But, as the game has been played
since the inception of the field, it is rather late to make a
fuss.

Brown Hill co. has dumped a colossal sum into

Tri bitting at Ballarat is a joyful game for all
others hut the miner. Pew tributors average over £1 a
week, although the system's apologists quote that a Sulie-
man Pasha party in ’B7 had, as successive fortnightly divs.,
£l2ll, £lOll, £852, £BO7, £926. But they conveniently
forgot that ever since that party has not averaged £1 per
man per week.

The spirits, or Mahatmas, have given their St.

Vic. ex-M.L.C. Gore shortly trots to London
with a pocket-full of floats, like the Great Avoca, Great

J. Bull has shunned Vic. alluvial ventures, but perhaps
this bail may land him.
*' * * *
The avidity with which Vic. mining co’s appro-
priated big junks of the annual prospecting vote is only
equalled by the pertinacity with which they forget their
indebtedness to the poor old State when div.-day chances
round. Of the money doled out to companies between ’B2
and '92, about £13,000 has been returned, with indifferent
grace, and many co’s have cheerfully spooned out the
divs. to their shareholders without any apparent inten-
tion of squaring accounts with Government. The depart-

Said that Sydney, Melb., and British capital is
available for working the Warrakilla (S. A.) mines. Which
reminds the writer that months ago he was shown an

Eastern capitalists won't, as a rule, touch S.A. mining

Lord Kintore, late Governor of S. A., has been

America. The process, the greater part of which, so far
as Australia is concerned, will be carried out at New-

possible cases will be done on the mine.

Wallaroo and Moonta (S.A.) Copper Co. made

The strings which were being pulled to draw
the Northern Territory from the hold of S.A. Govt, hav-
ing snapped, the speculators are now taking up the far
Northern country in huge blocks, each covering thousands
of miles. They secure it primarily for pastoral purposes,
but the leases give them the exclusive right of prospect-
ing for minerals over specific thousand-mile blocks. The
rental is nominal, ami Parliament has yet to ratify these
exceptional compacts. There are less likely things than
another N. Territory boom, when the Westralian bubble
has finally burst.

Maoriland is now having first call on London
market. The Rothschilds are everywhere, according to
report,but they are here in earnest, having already secured
several mines, and made mining managers of several
N.Z. Govt; mining-officials. The Waihi Co’s last month’s
output was 1950 tons for £7266 bullion. It has played the
chief part in attracting big Englislynoney to the country.
London money is now rapidly pouring into
Maoriland gold-ventures. As the Great Boulder is to
Westralia so is the Waihi lode to the land of the Maori.
Most of the M.L. prospectus-maps have near the centre a
big blot representing the Waihi, with a line drawn there-
from to the property on float.

a search of the locality and discovered the missing

much for the cleanliness of the city, anyhow ; in
a city that is cleaned as it should be, the constable
has to look for the ear the same day, else the sani-
tary officials will have swept it away. At. the
same time, it says a lot for the energy with which
Melb. streets are cleared of stray mongrels. If

The terrible Brunner mine disaster is
Attributed by some experts to the co’s greed in re-
moving the coal pillars from under the river as
the back regions of the mine became played out;
the unsupported parts thereupon subsided and
forced forward the gas-. Apropos, it is recorded in
connection with the Kaitangata disaster of long
ago (when only about a dozen lives were lost —
there are 66 in the Brunner) so liberally did
all the Australias help the miners’ families that
besides giving them a house and bit of land
each and help for a fetv years up to ,£lOO each
family, a surplus of £'0785 was left on the Govt.’s
hands. By Act of Parliament in ’92 this was
vested in the Public Trvistee to the credit of “ a
coal accident fund, to be available for the relief of
wives and children of coal-miners who may be
killed by mining accidents occurring in any part of
the colony. ”
* * * *
When the Mayor of Melbourne called a
meeting to open a local relief fund for the families
of the Brunner mine victims Chief Justice Madden
made an incautious remark. “ His only fear, he
said, “ as to the success of the movement was that
too many calls had lately been made on the purses
of charitably disposed people, who themselves
were in doubt whether they could financially sur-
vive the depression. ” This from a gentleman
who had just headed a movement for presenting a
purse of sovereigns to Dot Boucicault, who is not
know'n to be in any sort of distress, didn’t come
with particularly good grace, The Bulletin
fancies.
* * * »
Re the comparative position of a w r idow
whose husband has lost his life under sensational
circumstances, a typical instance of the hideous
humbug of fashionable “charity” was the fact
that, while superfluous thousands of pounds w r ere
being subscribed, years ago, in Melbourne, for the
w'idows of the pilots drowned in the “ Rip ’ acci-
dent, a woman whose husband had been more
prosaically asphyxiated in the Yarra was proved
to have died of actual starvation. If real charity
oovereth a multitude of sins, the notoriety-seeking
sort is surely one of the meanest of all sins.
It is recorded that, at St. Kikla bicycle-
sports the other day, Dot Boucicault had given his
ticket to two ladies, who did not come on time,
and that an Australian youth, who was requested
by someone who observed the comedian’s predica-
ment to hand over to the latter his spare ticket,
“ refused with a fiendish grin.” “ Not I,” said he ;
Mr. Boucicault says the Australians can’t speak
English. Let him stay outside.” Noble revenge !
However, the Australians really don’t speak
English. For instance, at a picnic, Marv (loq.):
‘ Eitey has the plites and Mirey has the kike.

some gripes. ”

Now and then the
world hears of a returned
Coolgardian with money,
as a sort of counterpoise
to the many returned Cool-

and some of these people'
try to start a feeble imi-
tation of the red, roaring
days of old Bendigo and
Forest Creek, when the
lucky digger broke up a
whole town with a small
gum-tree at night and
cheerfully paid for it in
the morning, and when it
rained gold and profanity
and blue ruin night and day. But it is a very, very
feeble and degenerate imitation. The other day a
returned person with coin from the West tried to
get up a riot in a Tasmanian hotel. He had no
one to help him ; the show would have started in
the good old days with a free fight of 12 diggers
and 47 dogs, but this digger was “on his own.”
Also, he lacked the rich profanity, needful in such
a case, but he swept twelve glasses off the counter,
said “damn” once or twice, and hit the piano
severely with the music-stool. Then a policeman
led him away and he was fined £5, and he didn’t
burn down the hotel or destroy, the town, or do
anything as they used to do it in the fine, copious
old way of 58. A lucky digger making a row in
fifi is a very tame spectacle.

Polyandry on the wallaby. Bolted re-
formatory girl (17, at leas; she said so) confided in
a swagman and agreed to co-travel. When near
Mt. Cam bier they picked up two more swagmen,
who willingly joined the family party on equal
terms. Arrested in Victoria for vagrancy ; result
—imprisonment for the men, more reformatory for
the girl.
A large, elegantly-dressed,
stern, proud citizen, much revered
in mercantile circles, had an un-
pleasant experience in Queen-st.,
Melbourne, the other day, when
he was accosted by a frowsy
female with a semi-black eye, the
atmosphere of a long drunk, and
indications of having dossed in a
dust- box. The disreputable person
rolled up against the immaculate
merchant; wound her arms about
his fat, red neck, sobbed beerily
on his pure white tie, and told
him thickly that she loved him
more than ever, and besought him
to forget and forgive, and to
return home to the children, and
no questions would be asked.
The respectable citizen gasped,
turned purple, and exclaimed :
“ Begone, woman ! ” But [the
woman refused to bego, and for
five minutes the poor man wres-
tled in the street with a strange,
dusty, beery female who clung
about his collar, while a number
of virtuous workmen from an
adjacent building gathered round,
and advised him to overlook the
past, and try and live peacefully
with the poor woman. At last
the merchant gave a bricklayer
half-a-crown to hold the distressed
lady whilst he escaped, and then
the woman claimed the brick-
layer as the husband of her ten
children ; but the bricklayer was
a diplomatist—he gave her three-
pence, and showed her a near cut
to a pub.

the pub. The Ladies’ Column A

The system of honorary ji; i C j adminis-
tration is bad, and a paid magistracy is not always
so good that it couldn’t be better. Melbourne sees
no reason for congratulating itself on P M’s
Panton and Nicholson. The one tried haM to
squelch the Mercantile Bank case, and the other
attempted to silence Lormer when that “ iniudi
cions person denounced the Bench corruption
which ought to have been stinking in Nicholson’s
nostrils for years past had he been a man of
observation. Practically, the Enquiry Board’s
reinarks rc Bap,port and Baxter amount to an
allegation of incapacity against the police magis-
trate whose judgment was so often influenced or
set at naught by those hardened wrong-doeL
At Sydney Agricultural Show. Children
from the Deaf and Dumb Asylum passing in and
talking by signs. Well-dressed countryman (loq.),
in sympathetic strain: “ Isn’t it a blank blanky,
blank pity to see those poor little blank beggars
not able to use theirblanky tongues ? ”
Amongst the exhibits at Sydney Agricul-
tural Show was a polished oak coffin, alongside of
which could be seen a couple of hearses and
mourning coaches. An embalmed “ exhibit ” may
be looked for next rear.
A Richmond (Vic.) •clergy-
man was the victim of a rather
unpleasant practical joke one
Sunday night recently. After his
sermon he said he would be glad
if any ladies in his congregation
would embroider a few small com-
munion-cloths. ‘ “And,” added
his reverence, untying a small
parcel, “ I would like them done
in something like this style.’’
Then he shook out and displayed,
to the gaze of the horrified
“saved,” a beautifully-embroi-
dered “Oh !”

An item for school-fees, in
an insolvent’s schedule, gave
J udge Molesworth achance against
those snobs who refuse to use the
State-schools, but don’t mind let-
ting-in the poor private-school-
master. Every schoolmaster in
Melbourne can tell tales to this
effect, and also of the number of
well-dressed, fashionably-living
folk who beg education for their
children at half-fees, and very
often no fees. (hie master tells of
two boys taken at his school for
half-fees ; one came every day on
a pony, and the other had a han-
som sent for him when it rained.
Also, he lately lost a boy who
was taught for nothing because a
charge was made for his books,
the irate father a member of a
very swell-club—saying that lie
considered the school had had so
many pupils brought to it by his
patronage that he was astounded
at such meanness.

wedding had had a serious quarrel in the course
of their engagement; - During this sad period of
misunderstanding the lady carried on an affection-
ate correspondence with a suburban doctor, who
refused to send back the letters to his fair friend
when she 4 made it up with ” her original sweet-
heart. Ultimately the affianced husband hired a
professional pug. to accompany him down to the
doctor’s place and recover the letters under threat
of a severe stousliing. The thought that a dis-
carded lover carries tokens of ‘ ‘ foolish infatuation ”
from your best girl in his tail-pocket, and sits on
them with a cynical smile, is bitterer than the
pangs of death. But such anguish doesn’t last
long, as a rule.

More Botany Bay mercy. Last Deniliquin
Quarter Sessions a young man named Roth,
charged with criminal libel, was found guilty, but
recommended to mercy. Being without means,
he was unable to employ counsel. He threw him-
self on the mercy of the Court and pointed out
that he had been locked up for two months await-
ing trial, and that having no money he had been
unable to collect evidence in palliation of his
statements. The Judge said he would give
prisoner the opportunity of not going to gaol (the
man who had been too poor to employ a lawyer !)
and would order him to pay a fine of one hundred
pounds only, in default six months’ gaol. Com-
ment would be an insult to the human intelli-
gence.

Unprotected selectors’ wives are often
molested by roaming Indian and Syrian pedlars,
and another danger threatens single bus’nmen
at the hands of the Syrian women, many young
and pretty, who hawk about the bush. They are
far bolder than their dark brothers, and, as a rule,
walk straight into the lonely bushman’s camp,
squat down, and by most suggestive means
coax the inmates to buy “ a ni’ silk aankairchief
for deer leetle girl.” More than one man has
already thus been lured to ruin. These attractive
women, though mostly innocent of English beyond
the prices of their wares, seem to know exactly
how strongly British law sides with the allegedly-
offended woman. Hence their dangerously familiar
behaviour.

The councillors of Milton (M.L.) lately
objected to the unbecoming conduct of the Mayor
in smoking a brief black pipe at council-meetings,
and sitting with his feet on the table. “When
you elected me,” said his Washup, curtly, “you
elected my pipe, too.” “Then, I suppose, we
must address you as ‘ Mr. Mayor and pipe ? ” said
a disgusted councillor. “ Quite so,” said the un-
abashed father ; “ you can smoke, too, if you like.
Then the council unanimously lit-up.

If any man tells you leprosy is
not attributable to the influx of
Asiatics, the following facts may
serve to convince him. In 1880
Queensland had eleven lepers all
Chinese. Not until 1892 was a
European leper known to exist in
that province. In Victoria, up to
1892, 10 lepers were recorded—all
Chinese, with one exception. In
Nov., 1894, 26 cases of leprosy existed
in Queensland. Of the patients 11
were Chinese, 6 were Kanakas, and
7 -were of colored races other than
Chinese and Kanakas. Two pnly
were Europeans. The Chows lia-
bility to leprosy may be Nature s
compensation for his comparative im-
munity from tuberculosis.

The eloping girl arrested in
Victoria for stealing the clothes (the
property of her alleged mother) she
eloped in, recalls the method for-
merly adopted by sweater-tailors,
ladies in a certain way of business,
and others, for compelling repentant
employees to stick to their bar-
gains. Their clothes belonged to
the master—or mistress— the
fear of either being arrested for
larceny, or of going away in a news-
paper, generally proved effective.
There is an express law now pro-
viding against this form of tyranny,
and, apparently, it could be very pro-
fitably extended.

There is likely to be a “strike” amongst
publicans and beer-drinkers at Tam worth (N.S.W.),
where beer is now 3d. a pint, which “ Bung ’ says
does not pay, but the bser-eater says lie will pay
no more. At Lithgow (N.S.W.), in the' “good”
days, such a strike occurred. The price then was
6d. per glass, and the miners thought 3d. enough.
“ Bung ” objected, and the beer-drinkers passed
solemn resolutions not to drink beer at 6d. per
pint under penalty of being ducked in the local
creek. Two duckings did take place, but after
three weeks’ total abstinence the buyers gave in.

MY SWEETHEARTS
SLEEVES
For The Bulletin.
My sweetheart is a girl as sweet
As one may wish to see—
Search all the world, you will not find
A fairer maid than she.
Her figure, too, is neat and trim,
Yet—ah !—my sad soul grieves,
For when she dons her smartest frock
She seems to be all sleeves !
I take the dear girl to the play
One night in every week ;
There, in the middle of the stalls,
We sit—but do not speak :
For all the young men gaze at her,
Yet—ah ! my sad soul grieves—
Never a girl can gaze at me,
I’m hidden—by her sleeves !
My sweetheart bought a bicycle
(An instrument I hate),
And soon upon the wobbling wheel
She’ll gracefully gyrate;
But one thing only comforts me,
Though still my sad soul grieves,
For, when she had her bloomers made,
She made them of those sleeves !
She does not wear those bloomers now
(We married—years ago),
And we have got a little son
(The finest child I know !);
And when the wee man went to school
(Now this one scarce, believes)
She made his first small pantaloons
Out of those same old sleeves !

And from his aching, heavy eye
There flows a tear.

Maud Hobson fair ;
And, with the pantomime must go
Those fetching tights
That Florence Young is wont to show
Amidst the lights.
Why does no shower of rain disturb
The weather warm,
To grant us glimpses o’er the kerb
Of female form ? ”
He sighed, then reck’ning that the dainty lace
May rise again,
He bowed his head and sought a holy place
And prayed for rain.

Sydney, April 7, 1800.
My Dear Moorabinda—
There was an unprecedented deluge of vice-
royalty at the lively Agricultural Show last
Saturday, which made rather an embarrassment
of spectacles—one wanted to be dotted all over
with eyes to get an idea of what was going on. It
was an amazingly good show. The pavilion was
packed full of exhibits, including a furriers’stall,
whereon was displayed a very taking thing in
floor-rugs—the skins of three golden dingoes on a
dark fur ground. Opossum fur seems to be coming
to the fore, though I think it is rather too
smudgy to be altogether becoming ; the Tasmanian
wallaby has the prettiest fur for capes. The newest
idea for bridal veils seems to be a soft fall of silk-
work silk, judging by a bridal doll in a case ; and,
really, the soft yellow Danae-like covering wouldn’t
be a bad idea for the omnipresent girl who marries
for money to face the music in. A femininely-
interesting exhibit was the silkworm display from
grub to reel. Silkworms were once the only hope
of the surplus Australian female, and I fancy
their cultivation must be good for the complexion
—the girl who has to chivvy the cocoons round in
boiling water gets her face well steamed, anyhow.
Hawkesbury Agricultural Society made a brave
show of tempting vegetables, including many
weird products which one hardly knew how to
deal with. For instance, a melon with a rind the
delicate color and texture of a lady’s flesh-pink
kid glove ought to be viewed more soulfully than
an ironbark pumpkin, and it seems to me that a
squash like carved and fluted ivory almost comes
under the heading of poetry.
The gee-gees were the stars of the show-ring—
the ladies’ hunting contest interesting womankind
most. The hard-faced equestriennes were not
very smartly turned out—they all used the old-
fashioned bucket-seated saddle with the unsightly
third horn, and a little more polish on bits and
buckles wouldn’t have been amiss. It seemed a
pity such plucky riders shouldn’t be stylish as
well. Almost all the human style centred in the
new reserve, a grassy terrace peppered with rustic
chairs, with a marquee in the middle. The
Governors were received with military honors—
the Anathema in two different keys by a shrill
chorus of boys and a blaring band producing a
Chinese discord that was novelty, at least. Gov.
Hampden looked elegantly but hopelessly bored
as usual—the very antithesis of the waddling Gov.
Brassey, who is vigorously alert and reminds me
more than ever of Ryley’s Duke of Muffshire seen
broadways in a soup-ladle. He wore a grey turn-
out and carried a large white brolly lined with
green. Sir Fowell Buxton was discreetly attired
like a Wesleyan elder. Doubtless he felt like it
—but on seeing H.E. I have it in my heart to ex-
cuse him for all his worldly shortcomings. When
Nature dowers a man with a long, severe upper
lip and the Nonconformist fashions make him
wear a monkey fringe of beard his face is apt to
get the better of him. lam sure many a man, if
all could be known, has had a tremendous battle
between good resolves and Family Herald legs,
with a victory for the legs, and the effect of a long,
silky moustache on an otherwise well-meaning
youth has robbed the Y.M.C.A. of many a
convert.
Lady Hampden turned up at the show in slate-
colored silk with fixings of ivory silk and black
silk gimp, a necklace of turquoises set in gold, and
a black jet bonnet with black feather and cluster
of pink roses, and black veil with black spots.
Lady Brassey wore a skittish hat of black with
waving plumes and wings of china-blue chiffon,
and a gown the color of old ivory with silk sleeves,
the bodice and skirt draped in spotted muslin ;
necklace of small pearls. Mrs. Freeman Thomas
—a nice-looking damsel with plenty of go—sjtorted
ecru with floral fixings, and a black hat with a
white veil sago-spotted in black ; and the local
viceregal damsels were all in light frocks. Autumn
is as autumn does, evidently. The Acting-
Governoress sported black, and society, fluttering
in the last robes of summer, came mostly double-
banked by naval youths, some of whom (new-
comers) looked like pocket editions of the youths
they succeed. Male fashions at the horse-show
are occasionally violent. One youth in quarter-
acre checks and a pink shirt suggested the
“Josser Jockey,” and an aide-de-camp in a pink
shirt-front and a scarlet tie (and other things, of
course) looked like the forerunner of a gaudy taste
in haberdashery on the part of the winter Johnnie.
Apropos Governors at the show. An enter-
prising thimble-rigger had fixed up a cosy little
arrangement in a convenient nook—a sort of
“ stepping-stone to gambling for the young,” and
he was only warming-up to his work on Thursday,
when the police dropped on him with the stern
mandate that “Gambling must be suspended
while the Governors are on the ground ! ” This is
a new halo for vice-royalty, but it’s a lucky thing
for the racecourses their Excellencies don’t always
wear it. If gambling was always “suspended”
when things were V.R., how much would the
loyal racing-clubs pay their many-sided Excellen-
cies to stay away ?
The agricultural banquet the same evening
in Sydney Town Hall was well-attended
—all the Governors at the spread, and all the
Governoresses in a hollow square in the Southern
balcony, where the majority of the women sat
looking on as large as life; but Gov. Hampden
was the first one to include them in his speech.
The Governors all sat at the top, but the effect
was not over-brilliant. Evidently a man can’t
get to the Apostles’ table and keep his hair on, for
the distinguished guests were mostly egg-bald.
Mind you, there is a suggestion of opulence and
well-being about a hairless cranium—a bald head
is the trade-mark of the prosperous—and I am
told that there are few bald men in lunatic
asylums. Here was a case in point (I am talking
now of prosperity, not lunacy) : the hairiest
man at the agricultural banquet was the forlorn
ex-Premier Parkes. But Premier Reid looks like
getting on—he is becoming so bald and fat. If he
continues to shed his auburn locks and put on
girth as he is doing at present, he will end in
being the humpty-dumptyist Premier on record.
The vice-regal speeches were interestin’, as Gov.
Hampden would say. Our own Excellency talks
like a mixture of actor Titheradge and a high-
church parson. He used no notes ; and his tactful,
tasteful, more or less spontaneous speech was dis-
tinctly the oration of the evening. The Governor
has a new way of presenting old facts. He
doesn’t invariably call it the “ dear Mother land,”
but alludes to the “old country ” once in a way,
and he doesn’t mention the silken bonds, though
his mention of Anglo - Australian ties being
“strong as links of iron” was rather an em-
barrassing simile to use in Botany Bay—it seemed
to me. Gov. Brassey’s boresome speech sounded
like the effort of a man with it all written out on
sheets of paper balancing in front of him on a
dessert-dish ; and Gov. Buxton talked like a Sun-
day edition of Stirling Whyte, and pronounced it
“ Austrailyah,” “bordah,” “greatab.” Gov.
Buxton, by the way, is the speaking image of
Water-jug Foster, and might be the elder brother
of Dr. Garran, of N.S.W. Leg. Council, who has
the advantage of him as far as hair goes. Admira
Bridge also orated, in a “ funny ” speech ; hut ]'
thought the best jest he made was in thanking
Australia for its hospitality to the navy. This
must have been sarcasm, for the Admiral is the
unfeeling martinet who kept his officers manoeuv
ring on the water de -pite all the manoeuvres o: !
society ashore when the fleet was at Hobart.
The vice-regal ladies observed the very opposite
tactics to feminine vice-royalty gone before, in tha ;
they only arrived when the smoke and speeches
began to ascend, whereas it used to be the caper
to leave when cigars went round. The feature of
the V.R. party was that everybody wore high
neck and long sleeves, making several half-peeler
women in the same balcony hastily put'bn their
cloaks. Lady Hampden’s coiffure was artistic,
and she wore black silk with sleeves of grey figured
silk and ruffles of black-jetted tulle. Lady Brassey
wore her favorite color in a yellow silk blouse
covered with black grenadine encrusted with jet,
and saddle flaps on the shoulders of yellow silk—
a pearl necklace with diamond pendant, grey
gloves, and a painted fan. Mrs. Freeman Thomas
wore a black skirt with a cream silk blouse pom-
padour pattern, black ostrich-feather fan. One
member of the Y.R. party in a white blouse
spotted with black suggested the very early
Briton who preferred to dress himself in
the hide of a spotted cow; and the vice-
regal damsels and the acting vice-regal damsels
were marvels of sweet simplicity. Four aides
including the depressed Capt. Freeman Thomas,
who appeared to be miles deep in meditation
and too weary to pick a flower for his button-
hole-squired the party and wore a lot of polish
on their shirt-fronts and gardenias in three of
their coats. It was no joke to squire that party—
eleven ladies to four youths. It looks as if the
present address of the superfluous woman is Govt.
House.
The first day of Randwick Autumn Meeting
was V.R. for about 10 minutes only, H.E. arriving-
after the Show, but the suite were dotted about
nearly all the time—one thin, tall private sec. in a
long grey suit looked like several feet of leaden
spouting. Sec. Wallington shed the light of his
switch-back profile on the proceedings, and
another welcome stranger was a handsome and
popular legal baritone who has returned to
Society’s bosom after a long stay in the musical
world of Paris. However, inasmuch as he brought
back his silky moustache in most excellent order,
he cannot have been badly afflicted with the stage
fever. A thirteenth-century shave is the unvary-
ing sign of the truly stage-stricken.
There was a frocky look about the well-filled
members’ stand, where the two most startling
garments were sported by two sisters (who sug-
gested comic-opera princesses) in ultramarine blue,
with blue velvet tops and white satin sleeves and
fixings fretted with silver, with felt hats trimmed
with blue and white exactly en suite. They also
looked like advts. for somebody’s washing-blue.
A usually smart society matron looked a sketch in
saffron-yellow with a stole of pansy-velvet and a
hat of many colors. The latest society bride
looked pretty as a peach in black crepon with
moonshine-green bodice draped in chiffon, and
yellow roses in her hat; and the married daughter
of a millionaire looked good form in blue and white
Alahama-coon-striped silk, with a black hat and
feathers.
A matron, just returned from a trip ’Ome,
sported an old familiar gown—oddly enough!
That is a rare occurrence. The average woman
fresh from Bond-street usually paralyses you with
the spikiness of her headdress and the eccentricity
of her frock ; though I have no fault to find in
these directions with another Society-matron, in a
very Frenchy tea-rose pink gown, with a real lace
pelerine, and her hair draped over her ears and
low in the neck, it la Trilby, and surmounted by a
warlike toque, all roses and vanity. The only
thing that wasn’t Frenchy was the lady inside, and
she looked as if she knew her prayers batter than
her Petit Journal. To make a real success of
such a Parisian turnout, a woman should see to it
that her mood matches her gown. I here weren t
many Autumnal novelties on view the first day,
the weather encouraging the people to trot out
their Summer attire.
The engagement between a dashing militaire
and one of the departed Gee-Gees has been broken
off by the Gee-Gee, who was due to arrive in
Sydney by a recent steamer. But a letter came
instead of the lady, who backed away from the
hymeneal altar on the ground that she was quite
too delicate to marry. After all the engagements
and rumored engagements between members of
the Gaiety chorus and smitten youths, only one
really came off ; you see, there are no silver kings
left nowadays. By the way, what’s the betting
now on the venturesome pressman who rushed
’Ome to marry Madge Rossell ?
An overflowing Society house welcomed B. and B.
back to Sydney Criterion on Paster Saturday,
when “The Pickpocket” went up fittingly
enough at this festive season. But it certainly
looked odd to see a great big notice —“ Beware of
Pickpockets”—on the stall-doors of “The Pick-
pocket ” itself—it was enough to discourage many
a playgoing youth with hayseed in his hair. There
wasn’t any Tanqueray frocking in the good old
farce, in which the stage-doctor made his usual
mistake, and sounded the patient with the wrong
end of the stethoscope. Emma Temple (who
certainly is one of the few women who can run
upstairs poetically) and Hilda Spong wore white
for three acts, and in the first short scene the two
ingenues wore frocks we’d all seen before. • I liked
Miss Temple’s soft white muslin better than Miss
Spong’s stiffly-starched garment, which one could
absolutely hear crackling from the dress-circle.
Now, I think Hilda has quite enough starch with-
out putting any in her dresses. Clever Dot Bouci-
cault was the waiter, “ Soup, sah ! ” and the hero
of the hour. It is really too awful to contemplate
that we must soon lose this gifted mummer, to
whom all Australia now yells out, “ Are you going
home to marry Pattie Browne ? ”
Rumored that a golden-haired and plenteous
Sydney society girl is engaged once more—this
time to a denizen of one of the Points.
Vice-royalty rallied to Rtndwick in full force
to see Wallace win Sydney c up on Easter Mon-
day. Sporting South Australians will rejoice to
hear that the austere Gov. Buxton had a seat in
the vice-regal enclosure, though His Ex. really
looked as out-of-place as a feather on a cod-fish,
and wore a coat that somehow looked unfinished
without a collection-plate. But earnest Christians
in Adelaide will rejoice to hear that though all
the other vice-regalities stood up for the exciting
Cup finish, Gov. Buxton remained seated with
the aspect of one to whom racehorses are vanity.
By the way, I wonder how Sydney’s blase Gov.
enjoys having Sir Fowell for a guest ? Consider-
ing the able manner in which Gov. Hampden
dodged coming to Australia per same canoe as
Gov. Buxton, it hardly looks as if our potentate
would consider his S.A. Ex. an indispensable
factor in the success of a race-party.
The V.R. women were not exactly over-dressed.
Lady Hampden evidently has only one best
bonnet, and not one of her daughters has the art
of tying on a veil properly to make it look like a
point in the toilette and not merely so many yards
of gauze to keep the flies off. As for their average
dressing, one might throw a stone in any boarding-
school and hit a dozen better frocks. Mrs. Free-
man-Thomas wore the “cheekiest” dress in the
V.R. box. It was a sort of pale - apricot
goffered silk, and had shoulder draperies of mellow
lace—a black sash, and Dudley Hardy hat of black
velvet and plumes and a dab of pale-blue, com-
pleting the picture. On the members’ stand there
was an olla podrida of summer and autumn dress-
ing. It was, perhaps, rather too soon for some of
the fur trimmings, which did look sudden
under the hot sun, but some of the flutter-
ing muslins were equally past the market,
it seemed to me. Perhaps the most correct-
looking garment on the lawn was worn by an
elegant Sydney woman—a snuff-colored gown, ex-
quisitely fitting, with delicate suggestions of violet
and white satin in the front of the bodice, and a
toque hat in the three colors. Purple and violet,
by the way, are the modish winter shades. The
golden-haired wife of a northern squatter wore a
regal garment of purple velvet and sleeves of
Trilby pattern, which became her to a T.
The Bland Holts had a S.R.O. opening at Syd-
ney Royal on Saturday—there wasn’t room for
even an astral body after 8 o’clock. The ladies of
the co. were warmly received, and pretty Mrs.
Bland Holt was handed up a singing canary in a
gilded cage adorned with plaid ribbons.
Australian girls may be interested to know that
smart London is going mad over very Irioht
colored straw hats, while the gorgeousness of the
new petticoats is making popular the French
custom of lifting the dress skirt very high with
loth hands.
The newest thing in Chinkie culture that I have
lately heard was a tea given to 2ti Chinamen and
presided over by a large number of young ladies.
r° ask a Chow to tea appears to me to be a rather
mettlesome invitation, considering what a connois-
seur in the beverage he generally is ; but then, so
long as it is handed to him by a plump and juicy
damsel, “John” will swallow cold jioison—for the
yellow man is very strong on the fair sex. That
is the great drawback to letting sweet seventeen
try her hand at teaching him, and is the reason
why any sensible man will chain his female belong-
ings to a log rather than let them go round con-
verting Ah Sin to the Fold—of their arms, in the
long run. For there is no gainsaying the fascina-
tions the slant-eyed son of Tea-land has for wo-
nianity. To begin with, I never can see much
difference between a nice, fresh Chow and a naval-
officer. Both are sun-burnt and clean-shaven and
both are adored and hotlv pursued by certain
members of the sex to which I find it sometimes
very amusing to belong.
Australia will soon have as many spicy Chinese
scandals as Chinatown in ’Frisco, where the efforts
of the infatuated Yankee girls to lead John from
his joss are frequently put a stop to by the iriar-
nage of teacher and pupil, with her family tearing
their hair in the background. I know of'a family
of very presentable girls living in a Sydney suburb
who make pets of a whole market-garden of
Chinkies, to whom they have given romantic
names, and whom they invariably address with deep
respect as “ Ah,” which is said to be Chinkie for
“Mister.” The conseouence is that the grateful
Chows serve up so much heart in the lettucee with
which they supply the family that every two-
pen’orth thereof almost amounts to a sentimental
declaration. Cabbagee with no worms i’ the bud
and a silk handkerchief or jar of ginger at the
Chow New Year are the sure and certain reward
of these back-door dallyings. Well does the wily
yellow man know the weight a present carries
with a woman.
New things in the soft, hygienic, cellular fabric
are the cellular stockings. Also I notice an extra
daintiness about some of the undergarments which
are frilled with fine cambric and new lace and tied
with pink ribbons, and are lovely things sugges-
tive of honeymoons, or the clothes that always
get hung nearest the neighbors’ windows on
washing-days. And the soothing part of it is that
the price of these dainty, hygienic articles is about
half what it used to be. And I would like to
personally recommend the cellular riding-corsets,
which are very comfortable and practically ever-
lasting. These corsets are much used by Society
on its bike, worn in conjunction with cellular
bloomers.
My Melb. correspondent writes: —
“An incident of a recent ceremonial was the
introduction to Gov. Brassey of the defendant in a
squalid and well-advertised slander case. The
bluff baron bolting the pill in choleric silence was
a contrast to his diplomatic predecessor in office,
who smiled arid murmured sweet nothings in the
ear of every schoolgirl to whom he handed a prize,
even unto the seventy times seventh, and would
have chatted amicably to Old Nick himself, had
the latter sought the pleasure of his acquaintance.
“The station-manager’s boundary-riding wife,
and the lady-farmers who take turns to do a
hoise’s work (vide recent Bulletin pars.), make
pale the halo of martyrdom worn by the Western
District (Vic.) woman who daily submitted to be
harnessed to her husband’s plough. To escape
detection, the tyrant drove his furrows before the
neighbors were out of bed ; but somehow they
suspected, and one morning they got up early, hid
behind a shed, and saw for themselves. Then
they rushed out, and, after handling the man
more or less roughly, laid information against him
for insulting behavior. At the police-court the
victim declined to speak, while the accused, with
tearful eyes and quivering lips, complained to the
Bench of the conduct of his assailants, ‘ They
bate me, your Anners,’he said, pitifully. ‘They
bate me on me own ground ! ’
“ Shearing before last, a clothier’s tout had a
painful experience among shed-workers. He took
orders for suits made to measurement, his terms
being a -small initial deposit and ‘ payment on
delivery.’ The customers were carefully mea-
sured, but exchanged names. Smith’s dimensions
being credited to Jones, and so on. When the
clothes came up from town, with names affixed,
the alleged owners, trying them on amid the scorn
and derision of onlookers, refused with lavish pro-
fanity to pay for the blanky misfits. The bam-
boozled agent, seeing for himself that the garments
were ‘ impossible, ’ agreed to part with the lot for a
sov. each. As soon as he was off the place, the
tricksters changed into the suits that fitted them,
and relate to this day how thev got ’em cheap.
Meantime, their gulfhad to face' his firm with the
story of the losing deal, and took the penalty of
his supposed disastrous bungling in the matter of
measurements. ,
“ No wonder the once omnipotent Wallington
feels out in the cold in the Brassey family-party
with its numerous new brooms, all more or less
akin. Then the Head of the House takes life
seriously, while his womankind are philanthropic
and recreate only in the departments of bikes and
babies. The members of the Hopetoun renime
were young-and frisky, and after the Countess
came back from with a taste for amateur
jugglery and sleight of hand, meal-times grew
more and more thrilling. The diners, one and all,
whisked and reversed overflowing glasses with
non-spilling intentions, while plates were broken
by the dozen in unsuccessful attempts to balance
them on finger-tips, elbows, and even noses.

shooting big game, he is now potting niggers.
Melb. Demise : Fred. Secretan, head of
the detectives from’6B to’73. There was a row
on his elevation, as he had been but nine years in
the force, and had not signalised himself ; but he
did fairly well —and afterwards did not do well in
a pub as uncongenial to him as to George Ireland.
For some years past, he had been satisfied with his
pension.
Bigamy appears to be somewhat lightly
regarded bv the police. One very handsome and
charming ’woman has been running round Aus-
tralia fi r the last few years picking up a husband
here and there, but no notice has so far been
taken. The Bulletin does not wonder at men
marrying her, for she is one of the gaudiest creatures
on earth.
The story went that Barrister Maxwell
had been chosen to represent the Crown in the
Melbourne “beak” enquiry because he wasnt
reckoned a “ dangerous man. But Maxwell
uroved to be about as dangerous as they make
’em He rubbed it into Rapiport, Baxter and
Co. slated his friend Lormer when the chance
came, and gave the Crown “ beans.” A good all-
round man.
The centenary of the death of the poet
Rnrns is to be celebrated in July. On the occasion
of the centenary of the poet’s birth, 38 years ago,
a great Scotch banquet took place m Melbourne
at which haggis, whisky, Scotch songs, and snuff
were part of the repast. Aspinall was present,
and some one asked him what he thought of
haggis. “I think,” said he, “that it is like a
dirty football with a bad smell attached.”
W. T. Forster, son of a former N.S.W.
Premier, after nearly a score of years of lawyer-
practice in N.S.W. backblocks, was admitted to
practice in Westralia the other day. At the same
time D. J. Walker Smith, English barrister and
literary man, who has successively found Adelaide
and Melbourne hard roads to hoe, was admitted,
along with about a dozen others. In all, about
150 lawyers are putting in time over yonder.
Premier Kingston and editor Finlayson,
of S.A. Register, were staunch private friends
prior to the miserable Adelaide Hospital dispute
which has brought Kingston so much trouble and
lost him his brainiest colleague, J. H. Gordon,
whose sister’s official appointment was the starting-
point of the dispute in question. Recipe—to burst
up a firm or a Ministry: Introduce the personal
interests of a, member’s women-folk. As it was
from the beginning, in the days of Paradise.
Sangster, the member for Port Melbourne,
who charges ship-owners with sending forth
coffins, is an earnest Scotchman of the heaviest
description. “What are you besides being a
member of Parliament ? ” was one of the questions
put to him at the inquiry. “ I’m a good many
things,” said Sangster, gravely. “So far as my
sea-going qualifications are concerned I am a
steamboat fireman.” It didn’t occur to him that
furnace stokers are not supposed to have any “ sea
qualifications.”
Rapiport, J.P., must have a full allowance
of Hebrew cleverness. No blind and impecunious
Gentile has yet seen his way to become a magis-
trate, a Melb. city councillor, and a leading
member of Melb. Hospital committee. The chief
wire-puller in the Hospital staff elections and
Council elections was blind Rappy, of whose
tactics some amusing tales are told. But Rappy’s
vanity—or, perhaps, it was business need of
notoriety—outran his discretion. He posed as a
secret power until his name became a by-word for
jobbery.
Commencement Day at Melb. Uni. this
year saw the admission as B.A. of its first Chinese
graduate in young James Cheong, a former dux of
the C.E. Grammar School. Young Cheong
matriculated in ’1)0 with the exhibition and first
in the first-class honors in Greek and Latin. Two
other Melo. Uni. students have been full-blooded
Chinese, viz., missionary Cheok Hong Cheong,
(father of-James above) who matriculated in ’75,
and Ling Ah Mouy, who joined in ’B7. Neither
took a degree, but Ling Ah Mouy became Melb’s
first Chinese solicitor.
During the historical period when the
N.S. Wales towns of Forbes and Parkes battled
for the possession of certain railway blessings,
Parkes, then Premier, visited the district, and was
besieged by the local big-wigs of each town, who
endeavored to extract a promise from him in favor
of their particular scheme. The old man not
having disclosed his mind, advantage was taken
of his departure to press him for a final reply.
Whereupon he said : “Hi ’ave no ’esitation in
A DISCREPANCY.
SHE: “ Young Baggie, I believe, takes his fences well?"
HE: “ Yaas, splendidly; but it's a pity his hawse doesn't take 'em at the same time."
making this confession, gentlemen, that Hi ’ave
gathahed the himpression that the hiron orse
should meander somewhere hin this locality.
Now that G. H. Reid lias acquired some
permanency, now that he has performed the or-
thodox rites, as it were, of Australian Premiership
having hanged a murderer, attended Scotch and
Irish banquets, won two general elections, and
sent a message of personal attachment to the
Throne and Person, and an offer of aid to the dear
old mother country —sculptors are turning their
attention to his potentialities as a statue. Some
difficulty stands in the way of giving plastic effect
to his eye-glass, such a thing being unknown both
in ancient and modern art. Others believe that a
bust is preferable to a full-length, for obvious
reasons. The Bulletin suggests that a “com-
posite ” of Reid's head and ex-Mayor Manning’s
legs would be a thing of beauty and a joy for
ever.
The death of M. Marius sets The Bulletin
thinking again of his one-time fiery passion for
Florence St. John, and of how the fire burned out
when Mrs. Grundy ceased to snort at it. He
wooed his Florence (then the wife of one St.
James) during the first production of “Madame
Favart,” at the Strand Theatre. There was no
make-believe about their stage love-passages.
Marius (as Favart) used to pop up through a trap-
door and hug Florence (as Madame F.) until the
audience turned pale from suppressed excitement,
and the lady melted in his embrace. It was clear
to the meanest understanding that both parties
were quite in earnest. A divorce-case, St. James
v. St. James and Marius, happened a while after
this, and the illicit lovers became Aian and wife.
Then Mr. and Mrs. Marius went into management
for themselves at the Avenue Theatre. Their first
venture was a revival of the old success, “ Madame
Favart.” Again did the French comedian pop up
through the floor to fondle Florence—but the icy
coldness of it! No ravenous kissing, no responsive
squeezes, no fierce clutching of the hands, no
thrilling effects whatever. The mated pair had
exhausted their stock of passion, and lost even the
power to play at being in love. A sight for gods
to weep over and the apostles of unbridled
“ healthy animalism ” to make a note of.
The other day the personally popular
Editor Gillon, of Wellington (M.L.) Evening
Post, who is head and front of the opposition
to the beneficent course of democratic legisla-
tion in M.L., came to Sydney to undergo a
surgical operation, but the heat-wave forced him
speedily home. Editor Gillon typifies in his own
person almost every era of M.L. journalistic his-
tory. Born in the Isle of Man in Jan., ’42, he
arrived in Otago in ’5l, and contributed to Otago
Witness in his teens. He soon became its re-
porter, was “special ” to the West Coast gold-rush
in ’(5l, and chummed on the Witness with Julius
Vogel, novelist Farjeon, Vincent Pyke, and the
Fenwicks. Parliamentary reporting haseverleen
his speciality: he is a first authority on M.L.
Parliamentary usage and history. He reported
the Provincial Council for the Witness in the
early days ; became Vogel’s chief reporter when
the Otago Daily Times, the second M.L. daily,
was started ; was made Hansard reporter in ’157,
then Clerk of Private Bills; resigned, and man-
aged the Press Association when started in ’72;
edited the Post; managed a rival Press Associa-
tion, and amalgamated it with the old one ; and
came back to edit the Post in ’B4—for good. Edi-
tor Gillon is the doyen of M.L. journalism, and is
a brother of Dr. Gore Gillon, of Sydney.
Jawbone Neild, the N.S.W. M.P. who
lately published a deplorable book of alleged verses
with gilt edges (the book, not the verse, is gilt-
edged), and is now exciting public derision by his
humorlessly-petulant platform attacks on the
reviewers, has hitherto not posed publicly as a
poet, so far as The Bulletin is aware. The
ferociously - moustachioed Mr. Neild is a tall
gentleman, with straight legs, who looks a little
like the late Marshal Lelxeuf in his best
days, and also strongly recalls a certain hand-
some Creole long an officer of the Victorian
J iistice Department. Ileis so well-groomed as to be
the ideal Duke of the London Journal, the dream
of tailors, and the joy of barberdom ; all of which
(in a country where every professional bard wears
seven-shilling boots) is strong prima-facic evi-
dence against his being a poet. Some excellent
legislative work stands at Mr. Neild’s cr< dit
in the N.S.W. Statute-book, and up to a late
date the only offences chargeable against him
were his memorable nine-hour Parliamentary
speech and a long string of hideous puns.
Just now Mr. Neild is in such a state of fury
(or self-advertisement) that on a calm night the
lashing of his tail in Woollahra may be distinctly
heard at Port Macquarie. He actually threatens
the Evening News with a libel-action for in-
stating that the idea of the Aged Sailor in a
poem of his wherein sea-monsters rear and wave
their tails, and wherein occurs the immortal
phrase, “eftsoons a nocent waterspout,” &c., was
inspired by Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.’'
Writes Mr. Neild :
But I am more particularly interested in your repetition
of an accusation made by other papers : “ He has evi-
dently dipped into Browning, also into the would-be
comical irreverencies of the modern American humorist.”
And it is also plainly charged that I have stolen from
Mr. E. T. GILLON , the Maoriland
Opposition.

Coleridge’s “ Ancient Mariner.” In these libels yon, aad
others, have, in one way, unintentionally paid me a com-
pliment. But misrepresentation of this kind is injurious,
and I now say I did not read Coleridge's poem until after
my “Out West,” was in the printer’s hands, aid I have
never read Browning at all, except one short piece, and
that also since my book was in type. Of American rhym-
ing humorists, beyond Bret Harte’s “Heathen Chinee,"
“ The Row on the Stanilaus ” (sic) “ Dod s Flat ” (?
Dow’s), and a jingle about “ Miss Montague and a Big
Emeu,” I have never, to my knowledge, read a line.
Certainly I have never heard the names of some writers I
am accused of copying, and 1 positively never saw their
books. I do not object to criticism, but I do object to
libellous misrepresentation, and there is a method by
which this can be put a stop to—a method I shall not
fail to evoke if necessary, and shall actively resent any
rervetition of the injurious accusations now replied to.—
Yours, &c., J. C. Neild.
The, mental condition of the man who cheerfully
wants to let the world know that he never read
Coleridge’s masterpiece, one of the greatest glories
of English literature, until his old age, is indeed
a magnificent illustration of the bliss of ignoranoe.
The curse of Dean followed Judge Win-
deyer over the Pacific Ocean. On the morning of
Feb. 18th His Honor, who was staying at the
Palace Hotel, awoke and saw (unless he still fol-
lows the Australian judicial custom of never read-
ing any newspaper except The Times, Argus, and
S.M. Herald), in that highly respectable and
wealthy paper, the Examiner, a three-column
interview-dissertation, done in the best American
manner, and illustrated with large portraits of
the inevitable Mrs. Dean and infant, Messrs.
Crick and Meagher, and G. Dean, Esq.,
master mariner. The interview is decorated
with 11 headlines and labelled “The Hang-
ing Judge,” and it is stated in black type
that His Honor’s severity ill capital cases has
made him “the worst hated man in Australia.”
However, the yarn proceeds that he “is not
a savaige-looking man, neither has he a tender ex-
pression. He is a strong man. The most con-
spicuous feature of his strongly-marked face
is his thick and pendulous nether lip be-
tokening strong appetite for material things,
just as the long compressed upper lip betokens
great stubbornness.” The Examiner goes on to
say that “ like most public men His Honor is not
half ho bad-looking as his cartoons would have you
believe,” and that “of course he would be better-
looking if he wore a moustache ; but then it is not
many men who can shave their upper lips with
impunity, and in British communities it is highly
unprofessional for a member of bar or bench to
wear a moustache. Even Judge Windey r’s highly-
unbecoming chin-and-cheek whiskers are a com-
promise ; perhaps he wears them because he does
not like the appearance of his own chin. Yes, it
is a strong face, and a shrewd face, too. It is the
face of one who would be a good fellow in his own
set, and that is what Judge Windeyer is. For the
rest, Australia’s hanging Judge is of medium
height, rather short in the legs, and heavily built,
with astrong tendency to fleshinessinthealiinentary
regions.” When it was suggested bythe interviewer
that the Judge was going to England in quest of a
Privy - Councillorship, lie “preserved a discreet
silence and dismissed the subject with a wave of
his rather fleshy hand as he stood in the hotel
lobby ; in fact, there was no subject on which he
cared to talk at any great length. He was in a
hurry to sally forth and see Chinatown, but
liis heavy face sparkled for a moment when
the Dean-ease was mentioned.” After briefly
outlining the incidents of the case, the Judge said,
“ ‘ Well, it’s all over now, and I am satisfied ; I am
going to take a rest.’ He smiled largely as he
spoke, shrugged his shoulders, and walked into
the street.” The Examiner then goes into the case
and concludes with “ No wonder .Judge Windeyer
wants a rest.” The S.F. Chronicle also had an
interview, which this paper has not yet seen.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Property may not be robbery, but the pro-
perty-vote is robbery.
The S.A. Anglican clergy have been hold-
ing meetings instructing the women electors how
to vote.
J.D. : Tasmania has free postage for news-
papers. Both dailies have representatives in Par-
liament.
The Imperial Govt, has at last assented to
the S. A. Act reducing the Governor’s salary from
<£sooo to £ 1000.
Candidates for the approaching S.A. elec-
tions head their addresses, “ To the electresses and
electors of—Coannaville.”
Mrs. Nicholls, the brainy head of the S.A.
new women, probably has more influence in S.A.
just now than Premier Kingston himself. She is
the wife of an Adelaide clerk.
Fegan, M.L. A., speaking on the threatened
coal-strike at Newcastle, N.S.W., trots out the
old gag—“ British fair play.” What s the matter
with Australian fair-play ? There must be some-
thing.
During the first three months of ’96 the
imports at Sydney were =£<892,000 more than during
the first quarter of ’95. How much less local em-
ployment does this represent ? Also, where is the
money to pay the bill ?
Despite Tory howls at the strong R.C.
element in his Ministry, S.A. Premier Kingston
announces that he would rather resign than en-
danger the system of free, compulso** mid secular
teaching in State schools.
For a pure, un-
adulterated fool the
temperanoe faddist
is easily first. Up
in Bananaland, if a
candidate for Par-
liament won’t sup-
port Prohibition the
teetotal organisa-
tions oppose him
tooth and nail. Now,
Labor candidates
are nearly all be-
lievers in the Goth-
enburg system, and
consequently not
prohibitionists.
This they say open-
ly—hence the cold-
water man rushes to
the Boodlewraithian
candidate, who takes
him to his bosom,
promises to sign the
pledge and shut up
all the pubs., and so
wins a vote. Hence
the curious specta-
cle of high officials
in the ranks of Tem-
perance supiiorting
the party which is
backed up by every
publican ana beer-
barrel in the coun-
try.
“It is the in-
tention of the pre-
sent N.S.W. Gov-
ernment to prorogue
at the end of Nov.
in each year, and
not meet again until
the middle of April.
This will give the
cool months to the
deliberations of pub-
lic business, and
leave the festive sea-
sons and hot wea
ther to hon. mem-
bers to be at tlieii
homes or attending
to their private af-
fairs.” Themanwho
attends to his own
affairs in the cool
weather may, in his
old age, manage to
lceepout of the jioor-
house; but the busi-
ness or professional
man who serves the
public when it’s cool, and only looks after himself
in fly-time, will have his books and his household
pots and pans sold over his head long before he
has become bald and shed his teeth. Work for
yourself in the cool time, young man.
Queensland Govt, recently ukased that all
walk-about kanakas who had been more than a
month unemployed should be compelled either to
return to the islands or re-engage. Tommy Tanna
may be a savage, but he is speedily waxing a very
keen one. Interviewing Caulfield, Polynesian in-
spector, Tommy wanted to know why white men
of the “ walk-about ” type were not compelled to
re-engage. A poser, truly ! Also —“ I go —ask
for job. Boss he say, 1 Suppose you work—l give
ss. a week.’ What must boy do? ” The inspector
then, in a feeble voice, assured the inquisitive
islander he would “ see justice done in the matter
of wages,” and the meeting broke up. Talk about
sumptuary legislation !
No reform of the J.P.-system is complete
which does not provide for appeals from decisions
of justices on questions of fact as well as of law.
It is here that the unscrupulous or spiteful justice
at present reigns unchecked.
There are now two Phillins in the N.S.W.
Legislative Assembly. One a Hebrew, the other
a Roman Catholic. By the return of Mr. Phillips
for Cowra, the Legislative Assembly has increased
its number of lawyers by one.
Bents of Western (N.S.W.) squattages
have, on the average, been brought down 50 per
cent, on reappraisement under the ’95 Act. Few
holdings west of the Darling will now average over
per acre per annum ; a few in the extreme
north-west are under a farthing.
The number of persons gaoled for drunk-
enness in Maoriland in 1885 was 1200, and since
then it has steadily declined until it has get down
to less than 600. The total number of arrests for
drunkenness in 1890 was 5677. In 1894 it was
only 4465.
Though the usury laws are repealed, the
courts often upset transactions between money-
lenders and “reversioners ” in cases where grossly
exorbitant interest is charged. Why not extend
this rich-man’s-son’s privilege to the general body
of the community ?
The Sydney Ministerial organ was quite
sure that Freetrade-candidate Lainond would
easily win at Cowra, but the Protectionist attorney
Phillips boat him by about 300 in 1200 vote 3
polled. The Freetrade dailies make no comment,
but content themselves with baldly recording the
result.
Drink statistics show that, in the last 60
years, the number of prosecutions for drunkenness
in Australia has fallen from one case per annum
for every 40 of population to one case for every
216. Also, whereas the ratio of publicans to popu-
lation was, in 1831, 4T per 1000, it is now only 2'3
per 1000.
In Maoriland lately two defaulting post-
masters were convicted and sentenced within a few
days of each other. The one who stole <£loo was
let out under the First Offenders Act, and the one
who stole £5lO got two years’ hard. Also, about
the same time, a solicitor who went insolvent with
a shortage of som. wh.ere between <£50,000 and a
quarter of a million in the trust funds, was ac-
quitted altogether, as having no fraudulent intent.
A CONFIRMED VICE.
CONSTANT READER : “ Hello! I see you've got Parkes in again this week.
Why don't you give him a rest; he's done, isn't he?”
OOR ARTIST : “ Oh, yes, he may be ‘ done ’; but, you see, Parkes has become a
sort of vicious habit with me. I acquired it when a child, and I'm too
old to leave it off now. It's far worse than drink.”
Under the N.S.W. Landaninkum - tax,
Broken Hill Proprietary mine, with its £500,000 or
more of annual profit, came within an ace of
getting off practically scot free. The way
the Act was drafted, it is alleged that if
the B.H. Proprietary had been freehold pro-
perty it would have had to pay only a land-tax on
the unimproved surface value of its patch of
hungry desert—probably about Bs. 4d. per annum.
The ground being leasehold it comes under the
income-tax provisions. But it was a narrow
escape, and the people who drew up the slipshod
Act have a lot to be thankful for.
Twenty-five linotype machines are under
order for Melb. Age. Some months ago Ihe
Bulletin pointed out a passage from an A . <
leader in which Li Hung Chang was commended
for not introducing railways in China, because to
do so would mean the throwing of many men out
of work ; and it was pointed out that, by the same
argument, I). Syrne should never introduce ie
linotype.
AN UNPACKED BENCH.
“He desired to hear the case against Ralph Brown, who belonged to the denomiantion of
Wesleyan Methodists, of which witness was a member. He attended because Ralph Brown was
a clergyman of his church, and having a regard for the purity of the church, attended to heat
the charge. He sat on the Bench and adjudicated. The case was dismissed."- Witness before
the Lormer Board.
MAG. : “ Any previous convictions against this man, constable?"
POLICEMAN X.: “ Only his religious convictions, yer Worship .”
MAG. : “ Six months without the option!”
This (Saturday, April 11) is nomination
day for S.A. general elections. It is considered
likely that all 10 Labor members who sat in last
Assembly will get back again, though Wood, at
North Adelaide, will be much squeezed. Women
relatives of all the candidates are canvassing hard
among their sister voters.
Brisbane Courier before the election :
“ Every elector of Brisbane knows perfectly by
this time that the defeat of Mr. Byrnes and Mr.
Kingsbury at the polling-booths will be a triumph
to the Labor party.” And now the return of
Fraser and Macdonald Paterson is trumpeted
forth as a Ministerial victory.
There is friction in Adelaide Hibernian
circles because the R.C. Archbishop insisted upon
taking half the proceeds of the late St. Patrick’s
demonstration to pay church debts, instead of, as
usual, allowing all the money to be sent to Ireland
to help the National League. Next year the
bishop hopes to annex the lot.
The S.A. churches are hopelessly divided
re the forthcoming plebiscite on the education
question. Anglicans, Catholics, and Lutherans
want a capitation grant for their own schools, but
all the other denominations oppose it. Some dis-
senters want Scripture-reading in school-hours,
but many prefer the Act as it is.
Asked by Ballarat Benevolent Asylum for
an increased grant, Premier Turner said the
revenue was falling, but steps were necessary to
provide for the poor. Parliament would have to
increase the income-tax, or to cause a municipal-
rate to be struck. Personally he favored the latter
course. The poor-rate is coming.
Australian Federation has been 15 years a
question of practical politics. It existed years
before in weekly newspaper and magazine articles,
and the forecasts of political and debating-school
leaders, but its first serious discussion in N.S.W.
Parliament was in 1880. In ’B3 the Federal
Council Bill was first submitted.
Much friction has been caused in inner
N.S.W. Protectionist circles owing to the reten-
tion of John Norton as secretary to the Central
Committee. After his intervention as a witness
for the Crown in the recent trial, the bulk of the
party regard Norton’s official connection as a
standing “red rag” to the infuriated though in-
dispensable Crick. Considering the poor debating
talent generally on that side of the House, the
party can ill afford to drive its brightest debater
and ablest Parliamentarian into a political cave.
A difference of practice with respect to the
necessity of renewing bail in ordinary day-to-day
adjournments in criminal oases causes confusion in
Melb. Criminal Court. The C.J. thinks special
applications unnecessary, but the gaol officials
won’t let accused go until the application is made
and granted, on account of the strict view other
judges take. Probably it will not be settled until
some speculative bailed individual neglects to
apply, is detained, gets a habeas corpus, and sues
a governor or two for false imprisonment, assault
and battery.
Saturday, April 25, is polling-day for S.A.
Assembly elections, which should be the stormiest
on record. The greatest interest centres m the
city and suburban polling, where the Ass and
Labor parties are running candidates in every
instance. The issue depends upon the
woman vote. Ever since the W.C.T.U. decided
to vote for “ moral ” men, candidates have been
damning each other’s characters, and the New
Woman has consequently got so mixed that it
is not unlikely she will at the last moment plump

In the Q. election, much priestly influence
was used on behalf of Byrnes and Boodlewraith.
At one of the chief southern Q. towns the parish
priest, a real force in local politics, slanged his
flock to vote against the democratic candidates in
the fashion of “ th’ ould sod.” His reverence, by
the way, was rank Labor last election. This tim«
a gentle hint went round from headquarters.
/ The N.S.W. Government has approved o
an arrangement whereby produce coming from the
country districts to Sydney is to be carried on the.
railways at a reduction of between 20 and 50 per
cent, on former rates. Produce carried from
Sydney inland pays the old rates, so, in an under-
hand fashion, the local producer is to be protected
against the foreigner at the expense of the commu-
nity—which has to make up the railway deficiency
by taxation —and the doctrine of absolute free-
trade and free competition is burst up once more.
There is no difference between handicapping the
importer by extra railway freights and handicap-
ping him by Customs duties; and to artificially
foster the agricultural industry is quite as im-
moral, on Freetrade principles, as to artificially
foster manufactures.
Pariss Nesbit, on Drink and Smoke and
Women :
Repressive legislation was not the way to cure drunken-
ness. A hundred and twenty vears ago no gentleman
went to lied without being drunk. (“Gentleman?”)
Yes, they generally went to bed drunk three nights a
week. (Laughter.) Was that so now? (“No.") Why?
Because of the greater complexity and variety of color
and interest in modern life. That was why the middle
classes did not get so drunk. That was why it was a dis-
grace now, when it used to be a glory. They drank then
because they had nothing better to do.' (Laughter.)
They did not know how to pass the time. What was
wanted to cure drunkenness was not repressive legislation,
imt brighter lives and happier conditions for our poorer
classes. (Applause.) Would they leave it to a lot o<
women to say whether they should have a glass of beer on
Sunday or not? Had they seen the published platform of
the W.C.T.U. ? No tobacco, no beer, no wine. And they
wanted to raise the age of consent to 9!) years. (Loud
laughter.) That was too old. (Laughter.) Ninety-nine
years and no beer. (Renewed laughter.) He said to Dr.
Magarey recently, “ It seems to me you want to prevent
me having a glass of wine in my own house.” He re-
plied, “ Yes, that is just what we want to do.” (“ Rot.”)
Yes; rot. That policy would uproot all the vines in
Bar ossa and make it a howling wilderness. (“ No.”)
They said so. (“ No ” and hear, hear.) And they wanted
them to do without their pipes. (.Laughter.) He was
reminded of Rudvard Kipling’s verse
“ A woman is oii'y a woman,
But a good cigar is a smoke.”
(Daughter.) This (holding up his pipe) was the only rival
a woman really had, because she could not scratch its
eves out. (Loud laughter.) Kingston did not smoke nor
drink, because it made him sick-(laughter)—and there-
fore was a patron saint, holy and chaste, of the W.C.T.U
and Social Impurity Society.

The show run by Percy St. John struck Hasting(M.T,)
at race-time, and announced a leg-show. When the gaff
opened the hall was fairly filled with trainers, jockeys
touts, spielers, and Maoris, one of which latter yelled out
in his lingo that the legs were no good. They were just
like those of the poukako (swamp-hen, noted for havin"
long, thin legs and a slender body). He wound up by
yelling out “ Kapai Maori wahine ” (very good the Maori
girl!) paying a just tribute to his countrywomen’s well-
developed limbs. The house noisily concurred.

B. and B.’s manager struck that sad Victorian town some
years ago when he was taking Frank Thornton around,
and went to the best furniture man to hire his very best
suite of furniture for the drawing-room scene in “Charley’s
Aunt.” The furniture man was cold and unresponsive.
“ No,” he said, “ I wouldn’t hire that furniture to any
theatrical co.” Then the manager smiled a superior smile.
“This isn’t a common travelling c 0.,” he explained. “I
represent Brough and Boucicault, and they should be
good enough to satisfy you.” “ No,” said the furniture
man decisively, “ I won’t lend that furniture to Brough
and Boucicault. It’s no use talking. I wouldn’t even
lend it to Dan Barry 1 ” Then there was a deafening
pause.
Maud Hobson is interviewed in the current number of
To-day. About the only thing she says is that she “ does
not care much about America, and Australia is dull.”
That’s not quite it. Maud herself is —er not dull
enough.
Miss Nellie Stewart’s failure to enfever the Americans
is discounted by the fact that she got much nearer that
goal than her predecessor, the Gaiety favorite, Ellaline
Terriss.
Of an actor well-known in Australia this wheeze is
told. He is a combination of Adonis and Lothario, and is
nightly in receipt of letters written on highly-scented
pink paper. A friend was in his dressing-room recently
when the call-boy brought round a letter. The actor
opened and read. “ Poor little woman,” he muttered,
tearing the paper and throwing the pieces on the floor.
The friend, however, had caught sight of the opening
lines : “ Dear Sir, —Unless your washing account is settled
by”
Writes Percy Abbott from Pietermaritzburg, Natal,
under date 28th Feb. : —Dear Bulletin, —We have almost
finished with Africa. For my opinion of it, see Snazelle.
If you have an enemy in the show biz. advise him to come
here. Fillis’s returns published in the papers say he took
1:11,561 —and exes. 1:15,679—in Capetown in about five
montns. The Gaiety Co. in Johannesburg made money,
so did Arnold and Sir Chas. Halle. Holloway is freezing.
Miss Fortescue froze. So did Camilla Urso and countless
others. Hellers are now do’ng well, but at first it was up-
hill work. In Cape Colony the Dutch go to bed at 7 p.m.,
and even when they stay up they don't want shows.
Natal and the O.F. State are better, but the distances are
long and exes, very heavy. One agent got into Pretoria
without cash, and while waiting for a remittance was
hiked before the land-rost, who took all his jewellery from
him, and told him if he did not pay his hotel bill (£1) in
two days he would be sent to gaol. He walked 47 miles
to Johannesburg, got his remittance, and when he re-
turned to pay his bill and get his watch, &c., he was fined
10s. How would some Australian pros, fare in such a
country?— P. Abbott.
Mrs. Gown Trotter, who has just accepted an engage-

Although Melba got the worse of her encounter with
Yvette Guilbert, she has scored heavily in New York, and,
at the conclusion of the last operatic season there, she
was ovated even to her heart’s content. She was recalled
time after time to receive the acclamations of the audi-
ence. They demanded still another song, and, to please
them, she sang “Home, Sweet Home” (they a’ do it),
Jean de Reszke playing the accompaniment. Then she
was presented with a diamond tiara. Did the Diva in
her wildest dreams ever look forward to her present
triumph ?
The programme of Plain Bill Holloway’s show at
Johannesburg is characteristic of that modest performer.
A list of names of artistes appears on the back page.
Holloway’s name heads the procession, then come Annie
Mayor and other ladies of the co., followed by the rest of
the men. This arrangement marks a wide distinction
between Plain Bill and the common or garden variety of
male actor.
Miss Maud Williamson wishes it to be known that she
is not suffering from any throat-affection, as rumored, and

Some dramatic piracy-cases have arisen in Australia
through the importation of contraband “ scrip.” In Eng-
land and America there are persons whose profession it is
to secure shorthand reports of plays, and have them
transcribed for sale abroad. In New York you can buy
the “ scrip ” of any new i>lav for 30 or 40dol. within a few
weeks of its first production’on either side of the Atlantic.

S. : How painful are the attempts of the average pro.,

the sanq froid of an ice-chest., and yet, fidgeting behind
the footlights, speaking his valedictory at Melb. 1 rincess s,
he was as nervous as a school-girl. Brough suffers just
as keenly, stammering commonplaces to a ho'-mgaiHi-
ence. Bit, stalls, circle, and gallery insist upon this kmd
of Whv? Is it a survival of the spirit that made
hangings popular entertainments ? The consciousness
that in going he is creating a “harsh hiatus that cannot

Boucicault attributes Australia’s failure to produce
good actors up to the present to three reasons :—(1)
Accent; (2) limited theatrical scope : (3) lack of oppor-
tunities for a thorough grounding in the art of acting.
He is a great supporter of a State-aided school of drama
attached to the Universities, just as music and painting
are now aided by means of conservatoriums. “I think
Australia is going to be the great voice-producing country
of the future;” and “Dot” adds that when he was in
London he was struck with the great inferiority of the
comic opera choruses there as compared with “the
firm s ” warblers. The latter’s voices are far and away
more natural, purer, and fresher in tone, he says.

Courtneidge made his first appearance on the stage at
the Prince’s Theatre, Manchester, about 19 years ago. He
was then a super., in receipt of 9s. a week. Last month,
he appeared again at the s line theatre—one of the finest
in England—in the capacity of manager for the syndi-
cated lessees, so now this amiable potentate can hold him-
self up to the bibulous mummer with the red nose as an
example of what “ ability, perseverance, and strict
sobriety ” can accomplish. But friend Courtneidge is
not the man to make speeches concerning his start in
life with the traditional Is. fid. in pocket.
Irving’s knighthood is expressed in the advts. by the

Gus. Elen’s new song, “ It’s a great big shame,” pro-
mises (writes a Bulletin correspondent) to rival in popu-
larity his famous “’E dunno where ’e are,” which made
him what he is— i.e., the highest-paid coster-delineator in
England. Chevalier, now ruined by the “ Trocadero
Hall” venture, is completely outshone by the new man.
Elen’s voice is very reminiscent of Robert Br ough, as the
Lord High Chancellor in “lolanthe.”
Amurkan stage training—on the authority of manager
and trainer Belasco :—I took Mrs. Carter in hand and
started her with the body exercise, to limber the ankles,
knees, wrists, and all the joints. Then I instructed her
in the rough exercise, showing her how to fall down,
without hurting face or body, on a mattress, on rugs, on
the bare floor forward, sideways, backward. Finally,
after courses of voice-cultivation, chinning, emotions and
passions, and Shakespeare, I would struggle with her
around the room, slap her in the face, dash her against
the wall, throw her over apd stamp on her. That ended
her training. . " .

The young Duke of Manchester (grandson of the lady
who eventually married Lord Hartington) has the stage-
fever almost as badly as our own adopted johnnie, the
Earl of Yarmouth. The Duke, however, is more modest
than Yarmouth, thusfar. He plays small parts only, and
engages a clever actress to stage-manage his amateur
operatic shows.

Charles Godfrey, Rickards’s big importation, “made

The serio-comic is never seriously comic, and seldom
comically serious. Thus she rarely earns her salary.
J. F. Cathcart, now playing at Melb. Royal, has received

Chirgwin, the white-eyed musical Kaffir, was in his
younger days a common or garden kind of all nigg'er,
who did a song and dance with his brother. One day his
brother fell sick, or quarrelled and parted company with
him, and then he reckoned his occupation gone. But the
manager of the hall where the brothers had appeared, not
carin<>- to lose a “ turn,” bounced Chirgwin into trying to
be funny single-handed. The lone, lorn creature painted
a white‘diamond round his eye, went upon the stage, and
was emboldened by the laughter of the audience to make
a great, original success, as nigger business goes. The
white eye was an inspiration.

A remarkably clever act is now being performed at the
London Aquarium. A lady artist fixes a loaded rifle on

weapon smashes the eggshell.

A Paderewski performance is described in a recent S.F.
Argonaut. The great pianist’s face “is one of the memor-
able faces of this epoch-poetic, worn, of a spiritual
beautv. The eves are full of an inexpressible, suffused
pain, like the eyes of a brooding eagle.” His performance
is abo-.e all, electric. “The piano, under his assault,
<rave forth the tones of an orchestra, and tremendous
harmonies, bizarre as the dance of the witches on the
Brocken, shook the audience from their languid appreci-
ation like a hand on the backs of their necks. . . The
instrument gave forth strange, unearthly sounds. The
thunderous opening chords clanged like the iron grating
of huge, reluctant gates grinding on their hin-es. . .
The thunders crashed away, shot through with gleams of
lifht little tingling shivers of notes that skimmed
across the piano ltke gleams of small, silvery fish,
as they twinkle by in the murk of streams.
Then hurrvinu- up in accumulating undulations, crowding
closer and' came floods of crystalline notes, runs
and ripples of them trickling through, like water over
stones, or sunshine through leaves, or bird-notes in the
silence of a breathless noon —anything that is clear and
quick and melodiously rapid. Storms of sound swept up
a.'ain and obliterated them ; tempests crashed over them.
Now and then they flashed out for a moment, sparkling
tricksilv and tremulously, like water-reflections in the
s in or small flames ; but the martial march of the bass
chords came up and up, clashing and clanging their vic-
tory sweeping the piano with their barbaric clamor, till
the audience for a moment forgot their manners, and ap-
plauded like live men and women who have heard a great
and wonderful thing.”

ACTING.
“ What did she wear ?”—Modern conversation.
She was mad to go play-acting,
And she went upon the stage;
But in art that’s so exacting
She’d no notion to engage.
So she bought a hundred dresses—
For it is unwritten law
That Worth’s the best of actors
And the only one to draw.
So she made these lines her motto,
To be followed not by halves—
“ While dress and undress fill the house,
The one who studies starves.”

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The old maxim “ Always back a good horse,”
was once again exemplified in the A.J.C. Doncaster mile.
The top weight, Courallie, though previously unlucky in
l>ig events, made a one-horse race of it, nothing being
able to match his pace in the home stretch. Albicore,
Patrona and Response were the favorite starting-price
picks, but the last-named only just secured a place. The
run was but (see. slower than the 1.40 record held by
Paris and Delaware.
* * • *
A peculiarity of the Doncaster was that the
ring unconsciously gave the public the straight tip. For
over a week before the race Courallie was a hot favorite,
and reigned so up to Friday night. The papers reported
thousands as having been laid against him, and the
public, thinking the stable had a good thing, stepped in
and took the odds straight out and in doubles. As a
matter of fact, the owner had taken none of the thou-
san Is, the horse having been forced into the market to
stimulate betting. On the day Courallie went back to 14
to 1, and the stable got its little bit. When the son of
Gemma di Vergy romped home Ikey Mo was consternated.
A little bit of inner turf history.
Courallie’s Doncaster win makes out Maluma,
who donkey-licked him in the Newmarket, to be a really
fine filly. She is at present suffering dental troubles, and
tw’o more of Redfearn’s are in Queer-street. Luck comes
in lumps.
» * * *
Though Courallie’s Doncaster win with 9.3 was
good, it doesn’t approach Marvel’s. The black demon’s
defeat of St. Blaize and 34 others with 10.4 up will never
be forgotten by those who saw it.
» * * «
Instead of an exercise-canter, A.J.C. St. Leger
proved a downright hard race for Wallace. Cabin Boy’3
ground-thieving tactics troubled the chestnut as at
Fleinington, and he only managed to score an impossible
win in the last couple of strides through sheer gameness ;
walloped from the turn he never shirked his gruel, and
finished in his characteristic plugging fashion.
» * '» *
There’s no such thing as a moral in racing.
Backers laid odds on Fucile in the Maiden, and nearly
fell down dead when a Nordenfeldt youngster, Snapshot,
almost upset the good thing on the post. Odds layers on
Wallace, too, looked glum until Cabin Boy was beaten on
the very threshold of victory.
» * * *
Response’s third in the Doncaster must have
been tantalising to her connections. She is one of the
sort that would just miss winning in either Melb. Cup or
a pony race with equal facility. If Richmond’s daughter
ever does win a race it will probabl v be on a protest.
* * • *
There wasn’t the toss of a coin between Dela-
ware, Valiant,and Aemena in the Autumn Stakes. Strange
to sa3% all the jocks appeared to have the same instruc-
tions. Even Delaware, when leading, was ridden a waiting
race. The last four furlongs was consequently a clinker ;
Delaware held his own, and that was all. Valiant and
Aemena were bang up alongside, and Toreador and The
Harvester handy.
* * * *
When Wallace just pipped Osculator in Vic.
Derby it was said he would have won in a canter had the
pace been sound. Yet, in every race since the pace has
been uncomfortably hot, and he has just held his own.
♦ » » »
Wallace carried the public through in Sydney
Cup, and the closing scene was reminiscent of Carbine's
win in the same event. The hilarious crowd was averse
to the colt’s defeat, not only because of its sincere liking
for the straightgoing and liberal sportsman for whom he
ran, but because he was the son of his sleepy-eyed, lazy-
going, sterling old dad, who had so often pulled them out
of trouble. Trentham’s pace-making was a prominent
feature, and it was only when near home that. Callinan
hinted that time was up by looking round. Wallace,
valiantly ridden by Gough, was able to come, but blocked-
in Toreador wasn’t until it was too late. Then he finished
perhaps faster than the winner. Wallace’s win was cer-
tainly most meritorious, but he ought to divide honors
with his stable mate, who ran third.
Newhaven, the odds-on soft snap for the
Champagne, met his Waterloo in Coil, who landed a 7 tol
chance easily, and avenged his Vic. Ascot Vale Stakes
defeat with interest. No one dreamt, either, of the un-
penalised Gozoozar beating Newhaven for places. There
may not be much difference between Coil and Newhaven
on past performances, but the writer believes Cobbity’s
brother will prove far and away the best three-year-old.
W.f.a. running isn’t a reliable guide for handi-
cap events. Delaware, Valiant, and Aemena, the Autumn
Stakes trio, were completely out of Sydney Cup. Torea-
dor, unplaced, ran second.
Wallace’s 3min. 31sec. in the Cup was only put
up once previously—bv Carbine as a three-year-old. But
Monday’s hero had only a stable companion, and not a
Melos and Abercorn, to beat.
Bob Ray unexpectedly beat Wallace in the
Champagne last year, and the Randwick-trained Coil fol-
lowed his footsteps on Monday in respect to the red-hot
Newhaven.
Trentham, third in Sydney Cup, was one of the
best-bred in the field. His half-brother, Lochiel, didn’t
develop into a stayer until a year or so after he came
across from M.L. and won the Newmarket. He won N.Z.
Cup after a number of tries, and then beat Australia's best.
As the combination books had Courallie and
Wallace scribbled all over them, besides being heavily laid
individually, Iky Mo’s Easter harvest will be robbed of
much of its richness.
During the last 37 years, Australian Peer and
Wallace have been the only two Vic. Derby winners who
annexed Sydney Cup same season.
The easy win of Cydnus in the First Nursery
indicates at least one strong Derby colt doing battle for
St. Alban’s in the Spring.
Chesterman was one of the last home in Sydney
Cup. He’d do better in another sphere, pulling some-
thing behind him —say a hansom.
Courallie carried 101 b. more in the Flying than
he did in the Newmarket, and won in 1.15. !
During the Cup finish Cook, on Toreador, yelled
to the beaten crowd to give him a chance, and one rider
replied in a most aggravating fashion: “ Garn, you can’t
win 1”
• • • * (
Now that Paris has got into form, he is very
likelv to win one or both of his important engagements
for the Great Metropolitan Stakes (at Epsom) and the
Chester Cup. The circular course at Chester ought to
suit the handy little horse to a nicety, and, although the
distance (21 miles) seems a little bit too long for him on
paper, it is less trying, than the same length of course at
Newmarket. However, Paris’s victory in the Northamp-
tonshire Stakes, a race of only 1£ mile, or thereabouts,
doesn’t prove that he could have come with a rattle at
the end of an extra f-mile. In Australia, he used to be
“ all out” before the finish of the Melbourne Cup. True,
Paris humped 9st. 81b. into the front rank when Glenloth
won, but on that day the luck of getting a good position
at the start made him sure of beat ing about 20 horses who
were flounderin''' in the mud behind him all the time.
Fortunately, he Is quite at home on soft-going, of which
there is pienty to be had through an average English
season.

The N.S.W. Agricultural Show-people seem
sadlv in want of a trotting-expert on their committee.
For'instanoe, the alleged trotting-exhibition prize, judged
or speed, style, and action, was given to Tuxedo, whom
the writer holds to be a pacer. The event was advertised
as a trotting-exhibition, no mention being made of pacing,
and the writer feels sure that the owner of Era could
legally demand first prize. To test trotters for speed on a
quarter-mile track is a farce. Tuxedo, a galloway, is a
splendid animal, but his size (14.2) and gait, pacing,
enable him to fly round a track upon which such upstand-
ing square-trotters as Tommy and Era would cut them-
selves to bits. Alec. White, behind the majestic Tommy,
would not risk injury to his charge, but simply jogged
him round the track, whilst Mr. Bartlett was foolish
enough to let Era out for a round, with the result that he
cut himself badly about the elbow. If the competition is
for trotters and pacers , and for speed alone, it should be
so stated.
The trotting in saddle was a sorry business, the
competition resting between Tommy S. and First Tem-
pest. Tommy S. trotted squarely, and for pace beat
Tempest, who trotted with his head drawn pretty well
round to his rider’s knee. The pair was then called back,
and First Tempest was given a big start for a mile go,
when Tommy S. again beat him. Why Tommy S. should
be asked to concede another horse a start in a best-and-
best competition caused much comment.

A feature of the jumping-contests at Sydney
Show was the fine form displayed by the veteran cham-
pion, Fairfield. Though a big crowd was saddled for
Tattersall’s Hunter’s Plate it was a foregone conclusion
from the start, the chestnut jumping in faultless style.

Judging thoroughbreds at shows is an uneviable
task. Experts differed widely at the Show in the stallion
class. St. Blaize, Correze, Matador, Sir William, Manton
and Co. all had their admirers It was a toss-up, but
Correze got the judges’ verdict. The Musket horse,
Manton, awarded second, seemed to have equal claims
with any of the others for first.

The mystery of the Victorian turf to some
people is Sam Cook. Nobody ever called Samuel a bloated

by a run of very bad luck. Whether he wins or loses it’s
much about the same to the imperturable Sam.

“ Baulky horses are best cured,” writes an
authority, “by diverting their attention. Go up to the
baulker’s head, stroke him a litt.e, and suddenly stick a
pin through one ear and leave it there. Gee-gee thinks
a tty is biting him on that tender point, tries to shake the
offender off, and can't. At this gee-gee wonders much,
forgets all about his baulking, devotes all his intellect to
trying to shift that ‘ fly’ pin, and goes like a lamb.”
Mr. Matt. O’Shannassy’s idea of fixing an inner
inside rail at the “ home ” turn was put into execution
at Caulfield on Saturday, and see ned to fill a long-felt

more than a dozen started for any race.

The Millers seem to have a rapidly improving

Melbourne’s own Fitz-Gibbon appears to
have brought the members of the old Yorick Club
to a sense of what was due from them in “ calls.”
A pathetic circular issued to the members by Fitz
aforesaid should give pause to all other old gentle-
men of his class who aspire to glitter in the centre
of a “literary, artistic, and scientific” circle—as
the old Y orick loved to call itself. In its recon-
structed form the club can’t pretend to be much
else than a rendezvous for ex-boomsters and similar
wearers of tall hats. Fitz-Gibbon, some years ago,
“ suffered the vacant position of one of its
three trustees to be thrust upon him.” A
couple of Bank officials shared this literary,
artistic, and scientific distinction with the then
town-clerk, and . they—during Fitz.’s absence in
England— renewed the club’s lease at a high
figure. Fitz., “ relying on the honor of the mem-
bers to meet the liability,” added his signature,
“and so became, conjointly with the other two
trustees, personally liable for fulfilment of the
The Australasian declares there is a
chestnut tree at Mt. Etna over 2000 years old. It
was from this tree, no doubt, that the jokes were
gathered which the Australasian publishes under
the heading “ Miscellany.”

“Respectable young girl with no children” is
explicit, anyhow.
Recent evidence of Smellbourne’s hard-
uppishness appears in the insolvency of Southwell
Coultas’s estate. Coultas was the fashionable
tailor whose profits, during boom-time, must have
run to =£sooo a year, or higher. “Depreciation in
the value of real and leasehold estate ” is the
nominal cause of insolvency, but a steady decline

covenants.” The club became unable to pay
its debts, the other trustees more or less
faded out of sight, seemingly, and Fitz. stood
alone, or almost alone, on the bridge of the
sinking ship, exposed to the volleys of unpaid
bills from truculent tradesmen. Hence his heart-
rending circular. The call made upon town and
country members in 1894 was calculated to rescue
Fitz. from his melancholy situation, but the
number of members who cashed up compared
unfavorably" with the number that didn’t, so he
had no choice between summoning those latter or
getting summoned himself. Legal proceedings
have thus far been avoided by the tardy awakening
of these defaulters, and Fitz., The Bulletin
hop es, will not suffer the “unjust and undeserved
indignity and disgrace of having his name called
in question for debts which he did not contract,
and for a liability which the club induced him to
assume.” The circular recalls to mind G. A.
Sala’s allegation re the Yorick Club. He said it
was composed mainly of a “gang of cads,” mas-
querading in literary and artistic characters. A
club which called itself the Yorick, rented pre-
mises at £6OO a year, and elected two bankers and
a town-clerk as trustees, was, perhaps, a good
deal less libelled by Sala’s angry remark than it
imagined itself to be.

MINES REPORTED ON OR SUPERVISED
—BY—
WILLIAM NICHOLAS, F-G-&, Lon.,
Consulting Mining Engineer,
Late Lecturer on Mining in the University of Melbourne ;
Lecturer on Geology as applied to Mining, Bendigo School
of Mines; of the Mining nod Geological Department of
Victoria, etc. Author of “The Golden Quartz Reefs of
Australia," “ CooJgardie Goldfields,'' etc. Address—
Coolffartlic, Wkstkr.v AnsTft.AT.tA,
Mr. S. Zollner, of 443 Kent-street, Syd-
ney, exhibited at the Sydney Agri. Show gal-
vanised steel piping which he claims will prove
invaluable by reason of remarkable lightness and
cheapness, for ventilating mine shafts, for irriga-
tion purposes, for flaming, for water-supply—in
short, for everything requiring piping. The Water
and Sewerage Board of Sydney are using Zollner’s
speciality for all the vent shafts of the sewers. So
light and cheap are they that the other day a big
order of pipes despatched to Hillgrove (N.S. W.)
froin Sydney arrived there at a cost for pipes,
carriage, &c., equal to the cost of cast-iron pipes
for carriage alone. The pipes’ diameters vary from
six to fifteen inches ; they stand a pressure of 3001b.
per sq. inch upwards, are not corrosive, will last
from 30 to 40 years; and have stood every test
required of them.*
One of the best things exhibited at Sydney
Agricultural Show was Jeffery’s filter, the Sydney
agent for which is Mr. J. S. Peardon, of Bond-
street. Dr. Gresswell, chairman of the Board of
Public Health, Melbourne, says : “ Out and out
the best filters are Jeffery’s ; I would fit these
filters to every service tap in the community.” J.
W v Springthorpe, M.A., M.D. (Melb.) says :
“ Filter all drinking-water through a Jeffery filter ;
the ordinary filters are useless against germs so
small as the typhoid germ.” The filter is sim-
plicity itself, and is very cheap. Tens and tens of
thousands of people had a drink from Jeffery’s
filters at the show.*
Messrs. John Brush, Son, and Co., who
run the well-known harness emporium at 403

their partnership ; and for one month only a dis-
count of 4s. in the £ will be given on the whole of
their varied stock. People who want harness,
saddlery, travelling trunks, perambulators, go-
carts, sulkies, wagsrons, rocking-horses, boys’
bicycles, bags, and other leather goods, are
advised to grasp this opportunity by the hair and
haul tight.*
The Western Boom.
The West Australian gold-mines are being roughly
criticised in many journals in Australia at°the
present time, and comparisons are drawn between
their output and that of fields established for over
half a century, of course to the disadvantage of
the western colony. No doubt, if the writers of
some of these articles were known, the public would
find that the critical scribe was a disappointed
jobber whose little game had been exposed, and lie
now works off his superfluous spite in a dog-in-the-
manger attempt to stop others from doing what
he could not do. We are happy to say that all
things in West Australia cannot be influenced by
the animosity of a few mediocre pressmen, and
that a good article will obtain public support even-
tually wherever it is introduced. Frossard's
Cavour Cigars have stood their public trial all
over the colonies for two years, and the people are
so satisfied that in many of the colonies it is antici-
pated that the Governments will consider it to
their advantage to considerably reduce the duty
on these popular weeds. Frossard’s Cavour Cigars
are obtainable everywhere in Australia in packets
of 8 for Is.*

The Costliest Memorial Window
in the World
cannot be appreciated except under favorable cir-
cumstances. Looking at it from the outside, em-
bedded in its huge frame, one gets no idea of its
beauties, but merely sees the faint outline obscured
by the deeper darkness within, and overshadowed
by the building in which it rests. But go into the
quaint old church : stand where the sun’s descend-
ing ray is softly sifted through the colored, artisti-
cally enamelled and arranged prisms of glass, and
you then see blended in one grand whole the
beauties of art in a harmony pleasing to the
dullest eye. < .
One of the finest memorial tablets in the world
is that recently erected by M. P. Millar, of “ Glen-
cairn,” Upper William Street, Darlinghurst,
Sydney. A tablet which memorises his thankful-
ness, one to which others may look with confidence
and admiration, and one which will stand the test
of years. The words on this tablet are deeply cut
in moments of direst agony and pain, and every
letter, every character, stands out boldly, carrying
invaluable lessons to us all. The text of this
tablet is “ I can speak in the highest terms of
Warner’s Safe Cure and Pills, which I always
recommend to my friends. When travelling
through the South' Sea Islands I suffered very
severely from my liver and kidneys, and conse-
quently consulted the local doctors, who prescribed
for me but without any good effect. Iliad often
been advised by my friends to try Warner’s Safe
Cure, and as a last resource did so. Upon giving
it a fair trial by taking several bottles I became

Metropolitan clubs should enact that every
Jockey weighed-out should weigh-in also, whether placed
or not. Cronk owners and trainers have a knack of ab-
stracting pieces from the lead-bag when compelled to put
up a straight rider. Disqualification ensues if he wins,
and they get their betted money if the backed pea runs
second. Also bag-tampering fits the bill nicely in case a
jock, is tempted to have a go “on his own.” Owners
should be compelled to pay a stiff fine for light weight, as
backers are.

The watchful “ talent ” waiting for a stable lead
is a feature of small meetings. Accepting short odds is
safer than supporting probable dead meat. A plunging
owner risked £l5O at Randwick the other day, and the
crowd fell over each other to get on to the good thing. It
went down. “ Following the money ” is only safe when
other dangerous stables aren’t trying, and then some
cranky, turned-loose outsider is liable to spoil things.
A recent arrival from India offers to wager that
he there saw a champion Sydney pony long since re-
ported as dead.

Joe Thompson was very much to the fore at
Liverpool with his double, treble, and quadruple book,

London correspondent. “ But I’m much afraid that the
‘ Leviathan ’ will not come out very much on the right
3ide when all is over, as some of the picks were very hot
indeed for the quadruple—and Joe laid 10,000 to 1, some-
times thrice over.”

The Martin-Parsons races conclusively proved
(writes a Bulletin correspondent) that Parsons’ superiority
of legs does not make up for his inferiority of head. The
plugging Yank, sees only the dollars ahead from the re-
port of the pistol. The crowd’s cheers have just the same
effect upon the man as they have upon his machine. The
Victorian, on the contrary, is a “gallery” rider of the most
pronounced type. Pedalling slowly around the track,
prior to starting in a race, he gazes patrpnisingly into the
faces of those surrounding the arena in order to observe
if each countenance wears a due expression of admiration.
At the M.B.C. meeting, after Parsons had thus saunter-
ingly completed several circuits, one of those “ sabre cuts
of Saxon speech ” came in stentorian tones from a spec-
tator : “ It’s all right; you get on your mark ; we’ve had a
good look at you.”
“And so it is at every meeting. The way Par-
sons allowed Martin to outwit him in the last lap of the
Mile would have done discredit to a novice. That he will
profit much by experience gained in continental contests
is extremely problematical. The case of the man who,
after two years’ continuous racing, shows no glimmer of
generalship, may fairly be considered hopeless. That
Parsons would have won the 10 miles with competent
pacing, even his opponent admits. He twice had nearly
a half-lap advantage, and could have gone on had the
pace been forthcoming. To quote Porta : ‘ After 10
mile, Marrtin very much exhaust—Parrsong, only a lit.
Put Marrtin head on Parrsong ; Parrsong win.’ And the
chances are that had Parsons only guessed how ‘ ver’
much exhaust ’ his ultra - game opponent really was, he
could have won the 10 miles despite the indifferent pace.
However, any ill-luck which the Australian may have hail
in the longer race was amply compensated for by his
good fortune in gaining a ‘ dead-heat ’ verdict in the five-
miles.”
The medley of pace-making in the Martin-
Parsons match appeared rather ridiculous to old sports
accustomed to seeing “ champions ” in every other kind
of racing travel on their own merits. And the wailing
after the 5 and 10-mile events ! If there had been a
better pace for one, or other, or both men, and if some-
body’s triplet had picked him up earlier or dropped him
sooner, or done anything different to what was done
where would the other fellow have been when the bel
rang? The prattle of the cycling world seems more
puerile than the awful blasphemy of the punter who
“ knew it all along and never backed it after all.”
The quadruplet was a dead failure as a pacer at
the Martin-Parsons matches. The four men up hadn’t the
hang of the thing for lack of practice, and so the quad,
wasn’t in it with Martin’s lightning triplet. The machine
was geared to 93, but runs to 120. Pacemakers are
squeamish about straddling a quad, at its best, knowing
that if am thing “ went ” it would probably mean coffins
for four.

Cyclist Porta had strong ideas of joining Dr.
Fiaschi, of Sydney, in that nigger-hunting expedition to

side for the man who can turn off a mile under 2min.

Don Walker attempted to lower the half-mile
record of 58 sec., but took 59 l-sth. Judging by the w-ay

think he was going “too slow'.” Apparently, however,
some enthusiastic admirers attributed his failure to “ bad
pacing.” So he made a second attempt and registered
61 l-sth sec.

Don Walker lowered Zim.’s record on the same
track for Jmile from 30 4-ssec. to 23 l-ssec. But too much
reliance can’t be placed on ticks of a sec. or secs, in cases
of a flying start where the antiquated pistol is used and
the ear and eye of the judge are trusted. The “ personal
equation ” enters too largely into the question.
Surely by a little electrical ingenuity it could be
managed that the passage of the front wheel over a certain
portion of the starting-line should sound a gon"- and set
the clock going, and that the passage of the wheel over
the winning-line should likewise sound a gong and stop
the ticker.

Football has developed a new and hideous skin-

For good fishing, go to the old penal settlement
of Port Macquarie. The ordinary fish-liar is there non-
existent—everyone catches fish so plentifully that he
hasn’t time to lie. Along the banks of the Hastings
whiting and flathead are generally plentiful, and on the
outside beaches fine bream and tarwhine up to 6 and 71b.
rage furiously. Last week a party of four caught over
260 schnapper in six hours. And fishing is not the only
attraction. One can sleep in the street at night without
being “ moved on ; ” likewise there is a municipal council
whose deliberations would rouse Washington Irving from
his grave to laughq also, a cheerful graveyard, where,
when the sun is hot, you can kill snakes on the dilapi-
pated brick-work of the tomb “ Sacred to the memory of

Mr. Ziman, the representative in Maori-

to contribute £ 1000 to start a fund to present
England with a battle-ship costing half-a-million

subscriptions in Australasia. Mr. Ziman (whose
idea is taken from a recent Pall Mall suggestion
that a war-ship should be provided by the mer-
chants of London) is going to do some big
mining flotations in London presently. His £ 1000
would go a very short way in buying a iJoOO.OOO
ship, but it would go far as a mining-float advt.

A TERRIBLE CASE OF
ECZEMA
CURED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. E. Wyatt, of Port Road, West
Hindinarsh, So. Australia, writes of
the sad condition of her iit.tle daugh-
ter, whose portrait she also sends:
“My daughter was afflicted with
Eczema of the most aggravated
type. The disease first appeared in
eruptions on her head, then her hair
began to fall ont, and in spite of
the best medical advice and treat-
ment she grew steadily worse. The
sores were full of matter and were
extremely offensive. Her eyes be-
came affected, arid she was, in truth/
in a terrible state. My neighbors
were very sympathetic and took
great interest in the case. They
persuaded me to try Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla, and I am most thankful to
be able to say that this wonderful
medicine completely restored my
daughter’s health. She has now as
good a head of hair as anyone could
wish, her eyes are perfectly well,
and she is a fine girl of eight years
with every prospect of growing up
to be a strong and healthy woman/’

The Pedaleuse: A Guitar Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Pedaleuse” is coming into vogue in England as a
name for the female cyclist.
Collins treated (his first name was Wilkie)
Long ago of “ The Woman in White,”
But now, in a garment less milky,
I he Woman on Whe Is is in sight;
Coll ins-street’d be almost romantic,
The “ Block ” no incentive to blues,
If She had not driven us frantic,
The hard-faced, stuck-up Pedaleuse !
So loose !
A he don’t-care-a Pedaleuse !
Some wear the high collar and shirting,
The necktie and clip d la male,
Over heavy inelegant skirting
That catches the wind like a sail;
Or, the sex s sweet coyness is bartered
r l' or the giddiest gaiters and shoes,
Not to mention—well, things that are gartered
’Neath your knickers, O brave Pedaleuse !
Sing low !
Is it brazen, or brave, Pedaleuse ?
They skirmish ahead of the dummy,
They join the parade to the church,
In a costume that’s meant to be “crummy,”
The hansom they leave in the lurch ;
The larrikin, knowing no better,
Hurls after ’em ribald abuse,
Then the newspapers publish a letter
That is penned by the pained Pedaleuse !
She’s on deck !
The pneumatic and “ New ” Pedaleuse !
But there’s something to us more ende,.
In the girl who has never aspired
To a saddle and knowledge of gearing
And who loves with a love never tyred ;
Give us Her with the Heart that won’t doubt us,
Give us lips that no kisses refuse,
Give us arms winding warmly about us—
The other, the best Pedaleuse!
Piano !
The sweet, and not fleet Pedaleuse !
Ballads !
The dear, side-by-side Pedaleuse !
Sweetheart !
The guarding and good Pedaleuse !
Here’s love !
The Angel-on-Earth Pedaleuse!
Melb., March, ’96.

No educational body in Australia is legally
empowered to confer the title of D.D. Hence, as

lie Rbntgen’s photography. The ordi-
nary philosopher is apt to forget that solids
are solids only in a manner of speaking. The
atoms of metal, stone, &c., are merely juxtaposed,
not united. In experiments with the hydraulic
press it was found that iron cylinders 3in. thick
“sweated” when the inside pressure reached
tons per square inch. This sweating was due to
the molecules of water forcing their way between
the atoms of iron and oozing to the outer surface.
Where water can go, certain rays forming part of
the ordinary light-ray will also find a passage. As
the expansion of solids means that their particles
are forced farther from each other, it will probably
be found that the x rays pass through heated metal
or wood better and more clearly than through
the same material at a normal temperature.
There is very fair ground for the assertion that
the Rontgen discovery is the “ biggest ” regarding
light since the days of Newton. Who will bet
that within a year studios won’t be opened in
Melbourne and Sydney for the purpose of “ taking
your skeleton ” ?

A Wonderlul Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness iu the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I ain now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

System for over seven years, and having tried
without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and T shall be most
1 1 appy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which
you have treated me, allow me to say that you
can make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.
As witness : John Hagerman (my husband),
caretaker Tivoli Theatre, Castlereagh- street,
Sydney.

One amusing episode followed the drink-
tratho chscmssion in N.S.W. Presbyterian Assem-
k 6 meenisters, who boldly avowed
oinipnt *** ed J goo , d & lass of liquor, was the re-
rJn i l da y s later, from an admiring city
merchant, of some “ choice old Scotch ” as a
tribute to his vigor and outspokenness.
~ ® ov - Brassey, like Robert Burns, has
quotations for every occasion.” H.E. never
makes a speech without throwing in a handful of
quotations. The Governor keeps up in Melbourne
tne custom he has followed for many years, of
laving notable extracts from his reading copied
y a type-writer on to separate sheets of fcap.,
and placed in order in index-boxes. So he
can turn up information, quotations and figures on
any subject from the wings of angels in the A box
to the breeding of zebras in box Z.

“He professed religion very ardently,
being a lay reader up to a few months ago, and
was president of the Christian Endeavor Society,”
says the Age, summing up a Vic. solicitor now
detained m a commodious stone building awaiting
trial. He frequently offered prayers in his office
when clients waited upon him for money, and
generally handed round tracts at the close of the
interview. One creditor was handed a tract,
headed Patience and Resignation,’ after dunning
him in vain for money.” Tne attorney is in trouble
on charges of getting at a workman with a large
family by a fraudulent mortgage on his wooden cot-
tage, and annexing a few hundreds from a police-
man. Also, there are certain suspicions about J 23700
belonging to a widow, .£450 belonging to another
widow, large sums belonging to four more widows;
the entire pile of an old man, who is beginning to
show signs of insanity over his vanished money,
and two or three dozen other items—in fact, if all
the suspicions are correct, the town has been
practically eaten up. And it took 20 years for
the local inhabitants to begin to suspect a solicitor
who “ frequently offered prayers in his office when
clients waited'upon him for money.”

Magnificent peroration of Q. Attorney-
General Byrnes, on the eve of his defeat for North
Brisbane :
Your chief has given you the signal—answer to the call.
Let to-morrow’s work gladden your chiefs heart, and that
of your old chief, Thomas M‘llwraith, who is faraway, but
not forgotten : and praise be to God he is improving day
by day ! Gladden Ms heart! This election is being
watched throughout the country. Men, women, and
children in distant parts will say, if you do your duty,
“ Thank God, Brisbane North is saved; peace and pro-
gress will reign throughout the land ” ; and many Aus-
tralian natives will throw up their hats and give three
cheers when they see you have returned ME, and. the
gentleman who is running with ME. . . . The signal has
been given by your chief as it was by another Nelson of
immortal fame : “ Queensland to-morrow expects that
every man will do his duty ! ” I ask you to rally together
side by side, shoulder to shoulder. The slopes are steep,
but with one great effort you will those slopes and
you will plant at the top the banner of your pride, and
the air will resound with the watchword of every patriotic
Britisher—“ Nelson and Victory ! ” (Loud and prolonged
cheering.)
Then the electors threw Byrnes out on his swelled
head with a thud heard as far as Thursday Island;
and the patriotic Britishers and the bogus Aus-
tralian natives steeped themselves in beer and
gloom ; and the little children in distant parts
cried because North Brisbane wasn’t saved ; and
dear old chief M‘llwraith’s heart didn’t gladden
one bit; and the disgusted Thomas Joseph went
out and bought a hat four sizes smaller and found
it miles too big for him.

Tli ; P cilice o' Wales wrote to S:e:id, of tlie
Review nf Reviews, about the hymns which had
imiuenced him. He didn’t say a word about the
hers. —Brisbane Worker.
The N.S.W. Seamen’s Union has passed a
resolution expressing its entire confidence in the
integrity of Sam. Smith, its late secretary, “not-
withstanding the verdict of the jury in the Daily
Post case. ”
Little Dr. Maloney, M.P. for N. Melb.,
seems to have sold the Age and his electors badly.
At the beginning of the year he applied for Par-
liamentary leave of absence on the plea of ill-
health, and stated that he intended taking a trip
to Ceylon and running over the island for a couple
of months. The Argus thereupon averred that
he really was going to India to join electric-healer
Geismardo alias Richards, in whose powers he
sincerely believed. The Age hurled back the base
insult with scorn. Now it would seem that the
Argus was more or loss right; Maloney’s name
appears bracketed with Richards’s in the latter’s
advts. The Age, in indignation, publishes ex-
tracts from the Indian papers in order to get
ahead of the Argus, and the North Melb. Labor
League has decided to cast out Maloney for ever-
more—whereupon a Bulletin correspondent :
“ Maloney’s troubles ! He never made a cent out
of politics. Most of his electors loafed on him for
medical attendance and comforts, and now that
the little doctor has cut himself adrift he can com-
bine money-making and amusement, and snap his
fingers at those he served if not too wisely, at all
events too well.”
“The City of the Dismal Drizzle ” is the
new name for Dunedin (M.L.). Someone else
christened it, years ago, the City of Slop, Slush,
I and Snuffle, but the name failed to stick.
Apropos the late flogging sentences : a
' Sydney lawyer, who once drove a coach-and-four
through the flogging clauses of the N.S. Wales
Act, and damaged it to such an extent that an
Amending -Act was passed to repair the gap, is
lying in wait to repeat the feat.
Sydney Mayor Isaac Ellis Ives boasts that,
although an old Sydney resident, he has never
attended Ratulwick races, owing to his deep and
consistent hatred of all gambling practices. Seeing
that the highest functionaries of the State-
Governors and Premiers —attend these celebra-
tions, this boast of the glorified alderman looks
like a haughty disapprobation of the morality of
his official superiors.
As surmised, the British expedition to
Dongola, undertaken despite the pronounced ill-
will of Prance, Russia, and Germany, is chiefly a
bid for an alliance with Italy which will
relieve Britain’s “splendid isolation.” Italy
is still alleged to be a Great Power, and J.
Bull has cash and credit enough to finance
her if the pinch comes. And, if she can be de-
tached from the Triple Alliance—which seems not
improbable, now—Germany will get another rub
in return for her bluster. Exactly how the Eng-
lish expedition will help Italy in Abyssinia isn’t
very clear, but there’s no doubt it is a clever diplo-
matic move in that direction, and it is gratefully
regarded by the Italian press.

We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Ci(/areltes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“ Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

Some Sporting Matters.
Another Keirl story : Just before last Melb.
Cup that accomplished swindler limped into Dr. O’Hara’s
Collins-st. surgery and spun a yarn about an electric-light,
wire falling across his ankle, which he feared was badly-
injured. The surgeon examined the stranger’s limb and
pronounced it perfectly in order ; upon which the patient
airily remarked : “ Well, doctor, I haven’t a guinea with
me; I suppose it will do all right if I send it up ? ” O’Hara
at once put the 21s. down among the bad debts but
acquiesced, upon which Keirl thanked him and said good-
day. On turning the door-handle, however, a sudden
thought seemed to strike him. “ By the way,” he cried,
producing a book of slips from his pocket, “ I’m getting-
up a sweep on the Cup, 100 at £1 Is. What do you say to
taking one, doctor, and calling the deal square?” Always
ready for anything in the horse line, the doctor detached
a slip and, at the other’s request, signed the block. Forti-
fied with the signature, Keirl immediately made a house-
to-house canvass of Collins-st. East, calling on every
medical man in the locality and hat he was
the authorised agent of O Hara to conduct a guinea sweep.
The result of that sweep will be advertised when the sea
gives up its dead.
* * * *
An exacting, garrulous trainer borrowed an ap-
prentice from a friend’s stable to ride a dead cert After
he had carefully explained at great length how he was to
start, where he was to stay, when to come, &c., the young-
ster said he understood. The neddy didn’t get a place,
and the trainer, as usual, complained that the jock hadn’t
done as he was told. “ Why didn’t you ride according to
my friend’s orders?” said the boy’s boss, later, as he
belted him with a stick. “ So I did, sir,” he moaned
pitifully ; “ but it was a six-furlong race, and he gave me
orders for at least 10 miles.”
* * « *
In the recent match for the Wimmera premier-
ship Stawell batted first and made 135 ; Dimboola had lost
five wickets for 90 when two men got together and took
the score to 335, the Stawell men being meanwhile sub-
jected to merciless “ chyak.” The bves had totalled 25,
when a small boy gravely emerged from the pavilion and
walked into the circle struggling under the weight of a
huge practice-net. Amid the roars of the crowd he
deposited it behind the wickets, and, after quietly indi-
cating its whereabouts to the local Johns, with a gesture
worthy of Fred. Kaye he retired. Even the Stawellites
had to smile.
* * * *
W. P. Crick’s jockey, in a burst of professional
anger, held forth thus to an admiring circle of equestrian
mites : “ Oh, Crick, he’s all right; but he’s got no brains.
He won’t never do as I tells him. He’s got no more nouse
than a, baby, he ain’t ! I can’t keep my temper with him,
sometimes. Why, if he’d taken my advice, he’d been a
rich man long ago. He’s got no more brains than a goat,
you take it from me ; and he knows no more about ’orses
’n a baby.” Which shows the value of “standpoint” in
criticism.
» * » *
If W. R. Wilson had been asked which horse he
would take if the pick of his lotteried stud had been
offered him, he would probably have picked the horse he
won in the sweep. London Sportsman reckons him the
finest St. Simon has yet sired.
* * * i
Mat. O’Shanassy’s plan for obviating the chance
of a horse getting “ shut in ” at the last turn of a race-
course is practical on the face of it. He proposes to force
the field towards the outer fence by means of an inner
railing, which will start from the curve of the inner fence
and continue until it gets into a parallel line with it some
30ft. or so further out, according to the shape of the
course. Then the railing will break off, leaving the full
width of the straight for the accommodation of the
crowd. The field will, naturally, open out, and the horses
in the second and third divisions will get a chance to come
through, if equal to the effort. Accidents among the
front division will be rather less likely to happen than at
present, and the crowding behind them ought to be con.
siderably lessened, one imagines. If the excuse for
crowding is made smaller, cases of foul riding will bo
tne more clearly apparent.

This, from an English paper, does not refer to
?£«?<>«• slaves, but to prof, footballers as they exist in
the dear old mother country ” : “ Darwen F.C. are doing
so badly, financially, that they are offering some of their
P® 8 ? n ) e o or sa k w ith the idea of clearing off some of
their debts. Stoke are angling for Maxwell, the centre-
fonvard, and have offered £BO for his transfer —a price
which the club would do well to accept, seeing that Max-
well has no very great reputation. Everton have been
a ‘ter Briggs, the goalkeeper, as understudy for Hillman,
but there has been a difficulty as to terms, the Darwen
people asking about £lOO for him. He is a good custo-
dian, but the club can afford to part with him.”

A sporting organ speaks of the con-fraternity of
sporting men. The “conk” (or “cronk”) fraternity is
probably meant.

In a M.L. trot once a Maori rode his own
neddy, a flea-bitten grey, and won so handsomely from
the limit time mark that he was re-handicapped for the
last event on the card. His penalty left him with no
apparent show, but he won comfortably, and paid a big
div. Half-an-hour later one of the stewards noticed the
joyful Day and Martin attending to two flea-bitten greys
in a pub.-yard of the township hard by, but it wasn’t till
after a week’s hard thinking that he tumbled to the fact,
which he afterwards verified, that the artful Maori had
won the last event with a clinking trotter passed out for
two years in an adjoining province a short time previously.

“ Footy ” Pearce’s son, who promises to make a
champion on the water, should take to the bike. There
is more money in it just now.
“Footy,” in the good old days, could nip with
the big and first toe with two-pound-crab power. On
one occasion the late Mr. Dailey and a party were out net
fishing with Pearce, and Plain Bill had his trousers tucked
up to his knees. His massive calf proved too big a tempta-
tion to “ Footy,” who, standing next to the shirt-sleeved
Caesar, gave him a lightning nip, and went on smoking as
if nothing had happened. A blood-curdling yell went up
from William Bede, who never discovered where that nip
came from.

The average johnny who tosses his chum for
cigars can't tell you what are the odds against winning
any two successive tosses. Very few readers of this para-

Heads or Tails correctly any particular three times in
succession. They all think they can, but they can’t.
N.Y. Amateur Athletic Board has decided that
a man who has “no visible means” is not an amateur.
What is an amateur, anyhow ? Sydney Rowing Ass.
the other day disqualified a member who helped his
brother to do a little plumbing.
The best way of impartially judging amateurism
in Australia is to walk round the three-ball shops.

A pitiable sight at Dunedin (M.L.) meeting was
the horde of bookmakers lined up outside the gate, be-
seeching admission. Though prohibited they will lay
tote odds on the quiet, and wandering private detectives
are useless in the paddock. On this occasion the tote-
receipts went up considerably. If other clubs adopt the
exelusion policy, bookie will have to view the races from
a neighboring gum-tree.

“ Twopence for a bicycle and its rider,” say the

Dogs’ tailors are the latest in fad-stricken

An eccentric French surgeon, Dr. Delar-
mel, has been experimenting on the larynxes of
various animals, with a view to changing their
voices. He now has a cat which barks like a

offered big sums to lend them to various travelling
shows for a term, but he refuses.
The J.P. once more, and Port Melbourne
again. One John Simpson came up to a total
stranger, a respectable woman, and addressed her
offensively. Told to mind his own business, he
promptly knocked her down and kicked her
severely. Fine, 40s. If you can knock down the
first woman you meet in the street and jump on
her for 405., Lady Brassey, as an asset, would be
worth —how much ?
Dr. Arthur Macdonald, social pathologist
to U.S. Bureau of Education, avers, with Pro-
fessor Krafft - Ebing of Vienna, that general
paralysis is largely on the increase among women
who follow the occupations of men ; hence an in-
creased tendency toward crime in women. If
there were as many women in active work and
business as there are men, then, instead of one
woman to every five men in the prisons of the
world, there would be five to five.
Dear Bulletin, —How is it that, with
apparently few exceptions, medical practitioners
are “stern, unbending Tories ”? Recently, when
travelling to Maoriland, a large number of my
fellow-passengers were medicoes —members of the
Interprovincial Medical Congress which sat at
Dunedin last month. Of the 50 or so whom I met
going and returning, I honestly believe not half-
a-dozen could be found—l could not find even
one—with the slightest leaning towards Liberal-
ism. They all regarded manhood suffrage as a
curse ; would deprive every unpropertied man of
his political right; favored land monopoly; and
considered that working men were overpaid, and
that the real saviours of the country were to be
found in the various Legislative Councils of Aus-
tralia ! Yet amongst these men, supposed to be
educated gentlemen, were many who had been
hit hard in the land-boom and by rotten financial
institutions—including two Melbourne medicoes
said to have dropped respectively =£50,000 and
£30,000 by the collapse of the boom and the failure
of the banks. These men blamed the Trades Hall
for their losses ; though if you asked them to
explain why they could not tell you. Now, how
is it that, while good democrats are so frequently
met at the bar and in journalism, they so rarely
gain foothold in physic? In my opinion, the
average medico is ten times a more rabid Tory
than even the average parson.

An Object Lesson.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Archbishop Carr, of Melbourne, has set up a really solid
defence for his beloved church-bazaar gamble. People
come to bazaars, says the prelate, with a view to spending
a certain amount of money pleasantly, and as regards the
games of chance in vogue at these Christian gatherings
they are “ rather calculated to moderate persons’ desires
to embark much money in such enterprises.” The race-
game, in short, is a sanctified means of warning its
votaries to avoid the Turf, and its motto ought to be —
“ Keep off the grass !”
Young Gussie, gay and debonnair,
Went down to a bazaar,
And, having half-a-sov. to spare,
Fell captive to a creature fair
Who stood behind a bar.
Not like to those where wicked drinks
Are vended by a forward minx,
With crafty smiles or brazen winks—
But quite another sort of bar,
Innocuous and circular.
“ One shilling in—the winner, ten !
Now, buy a ticket, do.”
Poor Gussie anted-up and, when
She’d wheedled nineteen other men,
A mob of gee-gees flew
Around a board in manner queer.
The scheme of working wasn’t clear,
But presently the little dear
Announced the winner—Number Two,
And ten bright shillings Gussie drew.
The maiden took the tickets back
To sell again, she did.
The winning number from the pack
Was dealt to Dick, or Tom, or Jack,
Whose luck the losers chid.
Dame Fortune smiled on every one
(For that’s the way ’tis often done)
Till twenty races had been run.
The truth could be no longer hid—
Each man had lost just “ arf a quid.”
Young Gussie scratched his hairless chin
And smiled a smile of woe ;
He thought it cwuel thus to skin
A simple lamb who wants to win
Some money, doncherknow.
The maiden spake, with gentle force—•
“ Suppose yourselves upon the course ;
You are the flies who back a horse
And I’m the spider, Ikey Mo. —
I beg you to regard me so.”
Those twenty punters thanked the maid
For teaching them to quit
The Turf, where Ikey’s odds are laid
Upon the system here displayed.
They blessed her ready wit,
And, gazing at her earnest face,
Swore by their hopes of Heaven’s grace
They’d never wager on a race,
Except when Holy Church thinks fit
To bid them drop their little bit.

J Hasty Inspection.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Minnie M‘Bride, conditional owner of 100 acres,
was taking her ease on her father’s farm when
word came that the new Crown Land Ranger was
close at hand.
For three weeks' Minnie had neglected her
selection, but in less than an hour she was in her
hut, removing the superfluous matter with
astonishing vigor. Before she had finished, how-
ever, and when only her front room had assumed
a home-like look, the ranger rode on to her land.
She peeped through the window-curtain, and
caught him looking at her new fence. A little re-
assured, she straightened her hair, donned a
smart apron, and went out to meet him. He m-
traduced himself, and complimented her on the
fine land she had secured. She put his horse in
the shed, and showed him round the place, draw-
r ’ ,
ing his attention particularly to her new fence and
shed. He admired both, and, with a light heart,
she invited him to the hut, and sat beside him on
the verandah. The Ranger was a young man
with a pleasant manner. Minnie felt quite at
home with him. '
“ Ever lonely here ? ” he asked. “You hear the
dingoes often, I suppose ? ”
“ Oh, yes,” she answered. “ Last night I dozed
beside the fire with the doors all open, and my
salt-beef boiling away beside me, and I went to
sleep, and when I woke the salt-beef was gone.”
“ They come right in, then ? ”
“ No, I forgot to put it in.”
He inquired about the people and selections
around, and Minnie answered in detail, laboring
slightly to give the-impression that she was. on a
higher plane than her neighbors. The evening
wore on, and the gathering darkness had a charm
all its own for them, until the mosquitoes gathered
also, and forced them inside. Minnie lit the lamp,
and the Ranger looked round with a comprehen-
sive glance that embraced the clean boards and
curtains, and the flowers and books on the table.
He sat down and gazed abstractedly at Minnie as
he talked, and treated her somewhat incoherent
replies and remarks with the utmost deference.
She felt elated. She knew girls who would con-
aider him deeply in love for less than this, and she
wished they were looking through the window
just then. Her books—novelettes for the most
[.art—were engaging his attention, when a horse
cantered round to the back of the hut.
Minnie rose with a heightened color. The light
fell on her fair hair and red cheeks as she passed
through the doorway to the dark kitchen. A
young man met her outside, and took her in his
arms. She whispered that the Ranger was in the
hut. He whispered, only his thick voice prevented
it being a success, that he had come directly Jack
Casey had told him she was there. He asked
anxiously if she thought she would pull through,
and she replied confidently that she would, adding
that the new man was none of your prying sort.
“ I don’t know,” the young fellow said, “Mrs.
Casey says he asks questions, but Jack says he’s a
queer sort—collects beetles, and lies on his back
under the trees. He said he would hang round
and watch the Ranger off, and he reminded her
that he had had a long ride. She dissuaded him,
however, and coaxed him away in a good humor,
with the promise of seeing her the next night,
“ I must lend him some novelettes,” she thought
as he rode away—“he is a little rough and his
mouth is alwaysWet.’’
“ They killed at home to-day,” she explained on
her return to the room. The Ranger was still
looking over her books, and she began to dilate on
her favorite stories, but in less than half-an-hour
he rose to go. He shook hands heartily, and ex-
pressed a hope to see Minnie soon again.
She sat for a few minutes after he had gone
arranging her little triumph for recital, until a
slip of paper among her books caught her eye. She
lifted it carelessly and read—“ M. M'Bride’s selec-
tion.—Owner in occupation. New fence and shed
completed. One room of hut comfortable. Dirt
and cobwebs in bedroom. Hornet’s nest hanging
from bed-curtain.”

BAY ASH.
A Study in Competition.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The same current that flung him across jagged
ironstone reefs swept the woman high amongst
weeds and' sea-shells under the lee of the island.
Eastward, a brown belt of dawn lifted from the
grey mists and storm-smoke that hung upon a
sullen sea. From the outer reefs came the grind-
ing crunch of ’a keel against ironstone, and when
the tide heaved across the red sand-spit the parrots
in the palm-scrub heard a rending of bolts and a
splitting of planks : it was the.death-rattle of the
good ship Diana.
Soon a radiating heat sent the bruised man
limping to the cliff shelter, and the same tropic
warmth shook the woman from a death-like torpor
and quickened her pulse. They met unexpectedly
in the cool rock shadows. A laughing gladness
crept into the man’s heart when he saw that the
awful solitude would be shared. But the woman,
.with thought-modes opposed to his, acted strangely
and became more elusive than thistle-down. He
watched her sadly, making mad, restraining ges-
tures from afar.
Then, being a sailor and somewhat of a car-
penter, the man built a house without hammer
or nails and heaped therein a fine, luxurious couch
of sun-dried weed and banyan leaf.
“For you to live in ! ” he shouted, and stalked
across the island to build himself another.
She crept into the shelter without a word or
sign of gratitude. Day after day he came over
with offerings of fish and wild bananas which were
accepted in silence and with much caution. His
hair grew about his ears, and gradually his rags
fell away and an era of fig-leaf clothing began.
The Diana-vestal quaked upon her altitude of
ascetic morality—the sailor-man’s legs were knotty
and short—in direct opposition to Art (which is
long)—and threw parabolic shadows on the sward.
Spring came, and one morning she peered from
her lair of ferns at the strange object that
approached her on all fours.
“Let me live here !” The object made signs
and a noise that filled the air with a myriad jargon-
ing birds. “ Let me live here, woman ! There
are devils in my house ; I see ’em at night. ” But
her hand made such a swift movement to the knife-
haft in her girdle that he fled. The offerings of
food continued, dished up on leaves—the last
touch of his civilisation.
“ Let me live here ! ” Thereafter he repeated it
daily ; and the same thing happened always —he
fled from the knife-haft. The equinoctial gales
brought another ship in the night to the grinding
maw of the ironstone reef. At dawn a wild-eyed
man without clothes glanced under his long-nailed
fist and waited for things to stir. A boat pitched
across the seething line of near surf ; no sound
from the black, forbidding wreck —hull spiked on a
fang of reef and stiller than a plague-ship.
“See !” he cried, in a language almost forgotten.
His finger went out to the incoming boat.
“ A woman in it; a woman only ; the others are
dead and drowned. Good. She’ll sing to me, and
talk. God, I hope she can sing!” He capered
frivolously and “without shame.” A white hand
sought his naked shoulder ; he turned to face, not
the terrible knife, but the beauteous, half-fawmng
Diana-woinan. „
“ This poor creature must live somewhere, she
whispered, “ and your house is very large.”
The wild-eyed man swung round awhile ; a big
blush stole down to his white legs.
“I have built, and built: now where do 1
live ? ”
“ In my house ! ” _
Diana’s arm swept seaward ; a knife vanished
in the blue like a gleaming wedge.

cut off the supply when the <£l deposit, which the
company demands and holds from all its cus-
tomers, more than covers the amount owing ! Of
course, the co. wouldn’t dare to do it; but most
people don’t know that.
H. : “To be really powerful, the parson
requires to sink again into absolute poverty,
the state depicted by Macaulay. The clergy all
hang on to the skirts of the rich, because of the
fiction that they must keep up a position in society,
and not allow their families to mix with the vulgar
herd.
Otago Witness (M.L.) publishes a screed
from a man who climbed Mount Tarapounamu
and looked down on the country round :
Far away to the east rises the great mass of Maungupo-
hatu, with its cliffs of limestone and its nigged contour
a mountain beloved of the sons of Tuhoe, the home of the
moa, the resting-place of the ancient dead, the abode of
the Tamakaimoana, descendants of the lost people, and
erstwhile the most savage of mountaineers. For is it not
told how Taneatua and Tawhaki and other old-time
ancestors came from the coast lands, from the Land of
Toi of old, bringing with them the mana of the new race,
the vigor of the younger branch, the strength to dare and
to strike ; and of how the ancient Ngapotiki melted away
like the sea-foam before the stalwart Polynesian vikings?
Hence it is that we do hear half-concealed allusions to
Nga Whatu-a-Maru and the sacred talismans concealed in
the great forest of Tuhoe Land ; and to Te Iho-o-Kataka,
the strange phallic emblem which stands at Ohaua-te-
rangi, near unto Ruatahuna, and to which sacred hinau
do resort those women of Tuhoe who have not been
blessed with offspring. To the south we see Maungatani-
wha and the sharp peak of Te Turi-o-Hana, and eastward
from those there looms the colossal Huiarau, the Sierra
Nevada of the term incognita of Tuhoe Land -Huiarau,
the great bulwark of the Uriwera, which protected them
from the tribes of the Rising Sun, the children of
Kalungunu. Westward rises Tuwatawata and the
great vertebrae of Pohokura, the last home of
the aborigines ; the valley of the Upper Whirinaki,
where the ancient tribes abode, and Wharepakua of im-
mortal fame slew the multitude of Te Marangaranga ; Te
Whaiti-nui-a-Toi, the home of the demon kawau, Hine-
ruarangi; and Te Ana-tuoro, which was formed in ancient
times by the tuoro. The valley of the Okahu, where
Tarewa-a-Rua and Te Manako and a host of other old-
time heroes lived and fought and died ; where the sons of
Pukeko held the Fort Oromaitaake, near unto Ngaputahi,
how came the vengeful Ngati Mahangi on the war trail,
and the descendants of Pukeko retreated to Niho-whati,
fell back on Umu-rakau, and fled to Awa-tarariki.
The Bulletin drops a tear over these brave old
days when Wharepakau slew Te Marangaranga in
Hine-ruarangi, and the Ngati Mahangi drove the
Pukekos from Oromaitaake to Awa-tarariki. They
were good times, but just a little trying to the
lower jaw.
Court Day at Billy billy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The court-house interior was almost bare of furni-
ture, the walls were unlined, and the weather-
boards gaped here and there, so that the grass-
hoppers jumped in and out at their pleasure. Their
worships (two of them) sat on a small form behind
a pine table, the prisoner hung over a deal railing
about eighteen inches from the wall, and Constable
O’Toole stood near, reciting the villainies of the
accused in a thick, monotonous, unintelligible
brogue. , ,
It was a day in Gehenna: the shrill, ringing
whirr of the locusts filled the air for miles around,
a bird chipped its beak sharply on the iron roof,
and a tall, attenuated goat stood in the doorway,
supinely observing the proceedings of the court,
and emitting an occasional contemptuous baah.
But the court seemed oblivious to everything
but the dreadful heat and its own sorrows. Half
of the court, open-mouthed, followed the meander-
ings of a lame bull-ant on the table, between in-
tervals of sleep, and occasionally stirred the
insect up with a straw to add to the excitement.
The other half, with his head thrown back, and
his occiput resting on the chair-rail, gazed medita-
tively at the roof, day-dreaming of strong drinks,
and occasionally relapsing into a gurgling snore
suggestive of a frog croaking in a ship’s hold, and
then pulling himself together with an effort and
trying to look wise.
And all the time constable O’Toole droned
along about “this yere mahn ” who had been dis-
covered the night previous, howling on the road
“ forninst widdy Johnson’s beyant,” with no-
thing on, “barrin’ th’ dust, yer worships, which
he’d buried hisself in.”
Prisoner was charged with drunkenness and
disorderly conduct, and was a woebegone object—
the Sahara incarnate. His tongue could be heard
grating against his palate, and he looked piteously
thirsty. When the policeman had done, he put in
a word or two in extenuation of his weakness, re-
minding their worships of the weather they had
been having, and concluding with a touching and
wholly ineffectual effort to expectorate.
Then the court felt itself called upon, and one-
half arose, and, steadying itself by leaning over the
table, assumed a look of inhuman gravity, and
said :
“ Prisoner, sush conducksh wholly indefenshible
—disgrash tyer manhood. Your are fined sheven
daysh or tweny-four hoursh. ”
Then that half sat down, with the air of a man
who has done his duty by his country, and the
other half arose, and, after blinking for a few
moments at the prisoner, with an assumption of
owl-like wisdom, added
“ Sheven daysh ’r tweny-foursh hoursh— both of
l/ou.'”
“ Yesh,” corroborated the first half, rising again,
“ both of you ! ”
Then the court adjourned.
