HIS
BOOKS
Among the Economists
Recipes for saving civilisation pour in by
the dozen. Some of the Australian authors
tend to be touchy. One John O’Rockie,
author of What Means This Unemploy-
mentt (Fraser and Jenkinson; 12s. 6d.),
annoyed because his book wasn’t noticed
immediately, followed it up with a letter
about reviewers who shelter “in the Coward’s
Castle of Silence-on-the-subject.” There is
nothing intimidating about his effort except
its length. He takes nearly 600 pages to
demolish protection, freetrade, trading
banks, the gold standard, etc., and get to
his cure—the issue of consumer credits.
Assume that there are available for consumption
purposes at this moment goods to the value of
£10,000,000. There are 200,000 unemployed. Let
the Federal Government issue through the Common-
wealth Bank to the unemployed a free gift of £5O
to each person. _ '
Mr. O’Rockie doe's not call himself an in-
flationist. His idea is that the notes of his
special issue would be retired from circula-
tion when the3 r got back to the bank. 1 here
is no mention of how often issues would
have to be made.
In Money and. Prices (Dent and Sons;
65.) Augustus Baker pins his faith to price
cdntrol, plus inflation.
To regulate prices was regarded in the Middle
Ages as a perfectly normal and necessary proceeding.
What the mediasval eraftsma,n or merchant meant
by the “just price” he may not have been able to
explain in the language of modern economists; but
he knew that it was possible to be fair in fixing
the charge made for a product of human effort.
At present there are millions of tons, which
are the products of human effort, that
humans can’t buy. He would set against
these accumulations of unsold goods equiva-
lent expansions of credit.
In time, all our productive resources will be as
fully employed as we wish them to be. Thereafter,
credit need only expand as population grows, and if
population neither grows nor declines there Is no
reason why the volume of money in circulation should
vary. . . „
Mr. Baker wrote after Britain went on
gold, and he considers that, nothing can be
expected from “that wise but belated act
without expansions of credit.
Ambrose Pratt in Elements oj Construc-
tive Economics (Robertson and Mullens;
Is.) calls for the substitution of “vital wealth
for gold as the standard of money supplies.
Every citizen has a computable economic
value. What simpler than to estimate the
population and its producing power, and
base a note issue on the result? Currency
requirements would be measured by a State
Issue Department on the basis of variations
in the statistics of population, production
and employment, money supplies being ex-
panded as unemployment waxed and con-
tracted as it waned. Control would be
divided between the Issue Department and
the banks.
Banking policy would thus be yoked with national
interest, a development of importance to young
democracies like Australia, which, because they are
deeply in debt to the older, highly industrialised
countries, and can only meet their external obliga-
tions by export of primary products, regard with
distrust the progressive interlocking - of bank directo-
rates in Europe and America, and blame the conse-
quential centralisation of money power for the
depressed price levels that have condemned them to
rgpay three bushels of wheat for each bushel they
originally borrowed.
Those three are inflationists of one sort
or another; Norman Angell and Harold
Wright, authors of Can Governments Cure
Unemployment? (Dent; 3s. 6d.), are not.
They believe in price control, and Reginald
McKenna, chairman of the Midland Bank,
is quoted approvingly:—
History has shown that, apart from wars and
religious intolerance, no single factor has been more
productive of misery and misfortune than the high
degree of variability in the general price level
A stable price level is a thing to be desired, second
only to international peace.
The suggested remedy is, broadly, State
control of marketing. Opposition might be
expected chiefly from two quarters—-Tory
employers and Bolshevist workers. But: —
If industrialists were convinced that the Govern-
ment was bent, not upon their destruction, but upon
selling their products and co-ordinating their efforts
for the benefit of the whole community, much of the
resistance which is at present lowering productivity
would be turned into active co-operation.
As for flip other side: —
The notion that Capitalist industry must be
destroyed still forms the basis of many platform
appeals to the more ignorant portion of the electo-
rate. This, and the other subtler fallacy that a
mere redistribution of existing wealth will solve our
problems, must be abandoned in favor of the advo-
cacy uf measures for increasing the productivity of
industry, if the Labor Movement is to succeed in
the business of government.
It has been shrewdly said that the world
first took to gold as a standard because it
couldn’t trust Governments. There seenis to
be no reason why
Governments
which notoriously
can’t be trusted
not to inflate, if
given the chance,
should be trusted
to “control the market—and control all.”
And there is the question of efficiency. Gov-
ernment officials handled only a few markets
in the United Kingdom during! the war, yet
millions are still paying for the blunders
they made.
Few deny, however, that something of
a constructive nature will have to be done,
and soon. There is a war on, so to speak.
A National Plan on the lines suggested
might succeed in a British community at
least as well as the Soviet one has succeeded
in Russia if it had a strong patriotic
backing; if the militant capitalists and
socialists could be given the outcast status
of conscientious objectors during the war.
A matter, largely, of propaganda. The
writers quote the famous memo, of last
July from Governor Norman, of the Bank
of England, to Governor Moret, of the Bank
of France, in support of their claim that
the matter is desperately urgent:—
Unless drastic measures are taken to save it,
the Capitalistic system throughout the civilised world
will be wrecked within a year. I should like this
prediction to be filed for future reference.
The feeling is general, and explains the
thousands of books about economics which
have poured from the presses of all the
nations in the past six months.
RED PAGE.
“Selling Themselves”
The managing director of a London pub-
lishing house once said to me, waving his
hand at the books in his office: “Ninety
per cent, of the writers will never make
more than their £3O advance on royalties.”
I asked the obvious question. “Most of
them write,” he said, “to express themselves,
as the cant phrase goes. They want the
world to see them in a particular light.
The Americans call it selling themselves.”
An odd thing about artists, both in paint
and words, is that they usually concentrate
on selling something they haven’t got, so
to speak. Turner, in the words of his
executor Ruskin (who destroyed hundreds
of pornographic drawings found among the
artist’s effects after death), had “abomin-
able-morals.” Turner posed as a respect-
able churchgoer. Dickens sold himself as
the Spirit of Christmas, though there was
neither peace nor goodwill in the house-
hold over which he tyrannised. In Australia
George Lambert used to sell himself as a
horseman, though he couldn’t ride and knew
little of horses. Norman Lindsay’s writings
and drawings have created an impression
that he is a rake. In an issue of “Art in
Australia” he is shown damning Wowser-
ism. The supply of drink runs out. “Why,
then,” cries Lindsay, “we must go to the
cellar and crack another bottle.” Absurd!
No Rechabite lodge has a soberer member.
Work is his only vice, tea his favorite
tipple.
These reflections were inspired by W.
Somerset Maugham’s First Person Singular
(Heinemann; 7s. 6d.). It consists of six
novell&n, a form in which this writer has
no living master. As the title implies the
principal character in each is the narrator,
W. Somerset Maugham. He is depicted as
kind-hearted, simpatico, approachable,
always ready to listen to the stories of
bores, and help them in their difficulties.
In “The Round Dozen” a shabby little
stranger in a battered bowler accosts him.
“Excuse me, sir*” he said, “but could you oblige
me with a match ?”
“Certainly.”
The outcast has no cigarettes.
“Let* me offer you one.”
I took out my case and he helped himself.
Mr. Maugham moves in the highest
social circles. From “Jane”:—
“Yes,” I said, “but that isn’t enough to explain
why Jane is here to-night amid this crowd of
duchesses, Cabinet Ministers and such like.”
We find him with the magnificoes again
in “The Alien Corn”:—
When I first met Ferdy he had been long estab-
lished as one of the smartest men in London; this
was at a very grand house in Norfolk. We were
sixteen and I felt shy and alone among these Cabinet
Ministers, great ladies and peers of the realm.
You are made to realise his virtuosity as
a sportsman by the very diffidence with
which he refers to his prowess. It is the
English aristo’s subtle way of boasting:—
I had played an indifferent round (of golf) in
the morning, and several sets of what is known as
country house tennis in the afternoon.
He has a patrician contempt for Jews.
“The Alien Corn” is a merciless exposure
of their weaknesses. But then he has no
Jewish blood. If he had he wouldn’t have
the bad taste to say the things he does.
A.s he remarks of poor Ferdy, “I was not

Win back your old-time strength! Regain the energy
of youth! Build up strong, robust health and fitness.
COLOSEPTIC increases your physical and vital forces
. . . gives you the power to resist ills.
MODERN FOODS THE CAUSE!
In these days of modern foods the
colon becomes encrusted with food
waste not properly eliminated
causing self-poisoning ( autoxima ),
the result of hidden constipation,
from which nine out of ten per-
sons unconsciouslv suffer. Germs
and poisons breed in this accumu-
lated waste. They enter the blood
stream, causing loss of energy, de-
pleted vitality making you old
before your time.
INTERNALLY CLEAN
Serious sickness will arise unless
this crust on the colon is removed
and the body made internally clean.
Temporary measures only aggra-
vate the condition—the encrusted
poisonous matter must be dissolved
and cleaned from the system.
YOUTH REGAINED
The prompt way to do this is to
drink COLOSEPTIC. Gently but
surely it thoroughly banishes im-
purities not only from the colon
but through all Nature’s avenues
for purifying the blood stream.
Then comes the vigorous vitality
of youth regained! Bubbling with
energy, you radiate glorious health.
Prove it for yourself.

quite sure of a sense of humor that made
such cruel fun of his race.”
Consider the real Somerset Maugham.
He probably owes his genius to his Jewish
blood. He isn’t a social success. He has no
more hope of getting into the Athenaeum,
for example, than Wells, though, 1 ike V eils,
he would be an ornament to it. On Ins
rare visits to London, where his wile has
a Chelsea shop, he associates chiefly with
actors and artists. He doesn’t play games.
For one thing he has had no time to learn
them. This pallid, exquisitely-dressed, lady-
like, industrious little man has produced
a book or play every year since 1897, and
hundreds of short stories. He isn’t approach-
able. A description in “The Human Ele-
ment” (and what a gem the stoiy is!) fits
him:—
He had the supercilious courtesy that is so well
calculated to put up the backs of the general public,
and the aloofness due to the consciousness that lie
is not as other men are, joined with the .shyness
occasioned by the uneasy feeling that other men do
not quite realise it.
Above all, he isn’t kind. S. P. B. Mais
wrote of his “Cakes and Ale”: “It is ruth-
less. It tastes of crab-apple.” Most of
his stories do. “The Human Element” is
about Lady Betty Welldon-Burns. Her
father was a duke:—
You could not open an illustrated paper (during
the war) without seeing in it a portrait of her....
She was a nurse in a hospital at the base and then
she drove a car.... Every one of her activities
was widely advertised and in her new l'Sle she was
profusely photographed.... The British public in its
odd way took her to its heart and Lady Betty was
a sufficient description of her throughout the Bi’itish
islands. Women mobbed her when she went to a
wedding and the gallery applauded her at first
nights as though she were a popular actress. Girls
copied. the way she did her hair and manufacturers
of soap and face cream paid her money to use her
photograph to advertise their wares.
There is only one duke’s daughter whom
that cap fits—and he makes her a slut, who
married because she was going to have a
child by a footman whom she had seduced
shortly after leaving the schoolroom. No;
Mr. Maugham is not a kind man.
Nearly all literary and pictorial artists
outside the ranks of the immortals try to
deceive the world about themselves; and
one can catch the immortals at it now
and then. The godly and god-like Milton
was as petty in the domestic circle as
Dickens, and the sublime Bacon turned out
to be a crook. Fortunately it doesn’t de-
tract from their interest. Rather the
other way. The spectacle of the clown
playing Hamlet is absorbing when you know
he is a clown; and he doesn’t know you
know it.
STRATTON STREET.
Naming the Book
A few months ago I confided to The
Bulletin a suggestion of the travail attend-
ant on the naming of a certain Australian
book. Perhaps it will be-seemly now to
add that the accouchement has been more
or less successfully accomplished.
I should like to be able to say that some
of the many offerings that reached me as a
result of the Red Page article —from
N.S.W., Victoria, Queensland and Maori-
land —made for a happy delivery, but
the grim fact is that every one of these
(and notably that of the sage who an-
nounced that his title was “conceived
within five minutes of reading the article”)
left me in deeper distress than ever! At
this stage at least twenty labels had been
under discussion, and every one carried
some, weakness, from the literary, natural
histoiy or bookselling point of view.
What was to be done? I essayed the
Johnsonian expedient of resolving, sir, not
to go to bed until the thing was fix’t. The
result was—merely Johnsonian. Finally,
having always at the back of my mind a
desire to emphasise the whimsical element
in Australia’s landscape and fauna and flora,
I altered the title to Nature Fantasy
(beautiful word, fantasy!) and added a sub-
title having reference to “the strange natu-
ral history of Sydney.” Alas, when those
titles reached Melbourne a cry of pain
arose! How many sound Victorians, it was
asked, would be engaged by a book pro-
claiming allegiance to Sydney?
With due decorum I pointed out that
Sydney, -per se, was a mere detail: that I
(Victorian born) was concerned with this
region not only because it was the birth-
place of Australia, but because it was one
of the most fascinating natural histoiy areas
in the world, and one, moreover, broadly
representative of the whole continent. My
plea fell on arid ground. Reverse the posi-
tion, said my mentor, and try to imagine
how many loyal Sydneysiders would enthuse
over a book that carried a title touching
some aspect of Melbourne, or even Brisbane
or Adelaide! I had some thought of argu-
ing that the evergreen Natural History of
Selborne was devoted to a particular
locality, and one not to be compared with
Sydney, but the observation seemed scar-
cely worth the risk entailed; and so I
merely extended the title to Nature Fantasy
in Australia, scrapped the naughty sub-title,
and retired from the nomenclatural arena.
That retirement still holds. I no longer
seek assistance or even approval or sym-
pathy in this matter, my only concern
being to acknowledge the reckless courage
of those Bulletin readers who rallied
blithely to the cause, and to warn them
that, if and when their own time comes,
not the least of their tribulations will be
the holding of a balance between cities
that are ever “challenging each to each.”

The Visit
Weather of Tartarus, N.’s dog with his
tongue tipped out: ourselves deafened by
locusts.
Early in the morning I pillaged the
garden, bringing in bunches of grapes, which
I laid flat on top of the ice in the ice-chest.
The hot sand, against my feet, made me
skip from one tree to another: and my
head threatened to crack under so many
strokes from the sun.
But 10 minutes in the shower-bath put
new strength into me.; so that I was begin-
ning to write with ease, when a knock at
my door put an end to the business.
I sang out, “One brown loaf” and “I’ll
pay you on Saturday”: then, rushing into
the open, beheld —not the baker—but
Norman Lindsay,
Norman, with grey hair pulled to a point
over his forehead.
A tornado of words: too many at once to
get into my ears, they forced my nostrils,
and tried to rush up my trouser-legs; so
that, after he had gone, I had to shake my
clothes and hang them across a chair be-
fore I could comfortably put them on again.
Some days later I found in my mouth a
complete sentence of his which I used
rapidly as if it had been one of my own.

A Satchel of Books
The latest addition to the art and litera-
ture of Sydney’s most conspicuous object is
Building the Bridge (Simmons, Ltd., Syd-
ney; £1 Is.). Robert Emerson Curtis, the
artist-author, is a young Englishman who
has made similar studies all over the world.
His dozen lithos. (and colored plate) convey
in firm, smooth lines the magnitude of the
undertaking, and capture the ant-like activity
of the workers and the romance that sur-
rounded their efforts. Each scene is described
in a few crisp pars.
First-class seasonal publications arc The
Weekly Courier Christmas Annual (Is. 6d.),
and The Weekly Times Annual (Is. 6d.).
Both are packed with photographs, colored
plates, stories and verse. Charles Wheeler
is represented in the Times Annual with a
fine reproduction of his painting “The Bogong
Country.”
Going Further, by Geoffrey Malins (Elkin
Mathews ; 10s. 6d.), describes a 22,800-mile
motor-bike trip, with a friend in the side-
car. Rush- and noise-lovers will find no
difficulty in getting themselves inside the
writer’s skin. What happened to Mr.
Malins’s British-made engines? Nothing, of
course. Mr. Malins’s personal engine seems
to have got through unimpaired. Certainly
his British mind lost none of its British
prejudices, though he took it clean round the
world.
Australia Beautiful. This annual “Art in
Australia” publication is, as in past years,
lavishly illustrated with color reproductions
of Australian paintings and photographs.
Sydney Municipal Librarian Bertie writes
engagingly about the local scenery, and Eric
Harding, a Commonwealth Railway officer,
describes a five-weeks’ shooting expedition up
north.
Australia and the Gold Standard (Robert-
son and Mullens ; Is.) by D. B. Copland and
G. L. Wood, who are respectively Professor
and Assistant Professor of Commerce in the
University of Melbourne, consists of exposi-
tions of such familiar subjects as the col-
lapse of the gold standard in Britain and
the exchange position in Australia. There is
a lucid account of how the stabilisation of
the French franc after the 1924-25 inflation
orgy, coupled with a boom in France’s luxury-
trades, led to the repatriation of French capi-
tal that had fled to London; and a conse-
quent gold drain on the resources of the
Bank of England. The writers do not believe
that England is permanently off gold. They
look on her departure from it as a chal-
lenge to the gold-liogs of America and
France; and argue in favor of an Imperial
Monetary Conference to discuss the closer
identification of British and Dominions eco-
nomic interests, with a vietv to Britain’s
return to the standard and the stabilisation
of the £.

CONFIDENCE AND CREDIT.
When an epidemic appears in a community
the doctors set out to find the source. The
cure is important, but the removal of the
cause is the real job. We may swallow
pecks of aspirin to relieve our headaches;
but until we get rid of the eye-strain or the
septic tooth or whatever it may be, the
trouble has only been bought off for a day.
Australia is suffering from the worst epi-
demic in its history, and the politicians are
crying out their remedies. As so often
happens, the quack is imploring us to take
the easy way. The Labor men are all
agreed that what we are suffering from is
shortage of credit. Supply credit, they say,
and we shall be well at once: people will
be able to get work and buy goods, the
factories will be set going and everything
be right again. But lack of credit is not
the disease; it is merely a symptom of the
disease. The banks can make as much of
it as ever they did. Four years ago they
were making tens of millions of it. Why
are they not doing the same thing to-day?
It is part of their ordinary business; it
is how they make profits. They stopped
simply and solely because they lost confi-
dence.
There is an idea abroad that the grocer
and the banker are quite different. The
banker, it is said, can create credit out of
nothing, whereas the grocer has to buy
the things he sells and pay hard cash for
them. This popular story about the banker
creating credit out of nothing is respon-
sible for a lot of misunderstanding. Actu-
ally he creates credit in the same way as
a man creates credit by backing a friend’s
bill. As long as the friend meets the bill
nothing happens; but if he has put the
money into some enterprise which hasn’t
produced any returns, then the backer is
called upon to pay up. It is then he finds
that, though he produced the credit out
of nothing, he can’t meet the bill out of
nothing. The banker may create out of
nothing the credit he advances; but if the
advance fails, if it even hangs fire, then he
has to produce solid money—or close his
doors, as the N. S. Wales Government
Savings Bank did a few months ago.
So this giving of credit is not such a
simple, harmless thing as it looks on the
surface. When it goes right it is the easiest
money in the world; when it goes wrong, it
can be the most disastrous. A few years ago
a new bank was established in Australia, the
Primary Producers, and shareholders put up
well on towards half a million of money.
The enterprise, though quite well handled,
closed its doors lately. The shareholders will
not get a penny of their money back; they
will be lucky if they are not called upon
to pay some of the uncalled capital for
which they made themselves further respon-
sible. Whenever credit is given and pay-
ment fails, somebody has to pay hard cash.
When you give credit you have to take a
chance. If this and enough similar chances
go against you, you will be broke. Before
you lend you will therefore want to be as
sure as you can be that you will get your
money; for a loss of capital will wipe out
the profits of years, if it does' not land you
high on the rocks. The first essential of
credit, therefore, is confidence. Credit grows
out of confidence. It doesn’t have to be
cultivated. It simply can’t be repressed.
No doubt it can be forced—that is to say,
created without confidence. The simplest
way to do this is by using the printing-
press. But this can only be done at tre-
mendous risk. We are not by any means
strangers to this process. In five years prior
to 1929 we used it strenuously: we printed
and issued promises to pay no less than 141
million pounds. The effect was just the same
as if we had issued 141 million £ notes. The
spending created a boom. Prices of every-
thing rose. Then the spending stopped;
there was nothing to sustain the prices;
and a wave of unemployment naturally
followed. We can produce just such another
boom by the issue of a few extra million notes
and we shall produce the same '•-•suits —
and more. Theodore is entirely right: you
can relieve unemployment by a forced
note issue, just as you can by an issue of
Government bonds. But unless the issue
of notes can create confidence, they will
have just the same temporary booming
effect as the issue of the 141 millions of
Government bonds did in 1924-29, and the
same shattering after-effects.
There is quite a considerable body of
people who believe that the printing-press
might be used in moderation to good effect,
They say that it is too difficult or too
troublesome to fight our way back to the
old low costs, and would be much easier
to adulterate the currency, thereby making
the worker think he is getting the same
high wages when as a matter of fact he is
getting nothing of the kind. The Bulletin
can understand many people approving of
that policy; but it can’t understand a Labor
man doing it. Yet it. is what the Theodore
policy of “controlled inflation” means. It
can have no other purpose, no other justifi-
cation. '
The only point in doubt is whether such
inflation would restore confidence. It
might; but there is a very grave doubt
about it. Can confidence be safely built
upon what, after all, is only a confidence
trick? And there is always the danger that
the inflation would get out of control: it
almost always does. If it did, the conse-
quences admittedly would be most disas-
trous. With that peril ahead, how could
the policy of inflation—even the Govern-
ment’s mild policy of controlled inflation—•
produce confidence?
On a hundred questions the opinion of
the person of means is not worth a farthing
more than the opinion of the poorest m
the land indeed, is often worth less. Hence
there have been many elections m which
a policy was none the better for having
won le appro\ al of the people with some-
thing to stake on the future. This is not
one of those elections. No policy is good
now which will not give these people confi-
dence. Whether Beasley or Lang or Ward
oi Lazzanm or even James Scullin has a
good opinion of it doesn t matter very
nu , ch - The whole point is under what
leader will the people with credit to give
feel most confidence? If it is Lyons, then
Lyons is the right answer for the unem-
ployed and others who have no credit to
g!ve but stand to gam enormously when
credit has been re-established.
PROFIT OR HUMANITY?
When you come to think of it this is a
pretty large and complex world to keep in
smooth working order. It would call for
expert handling and constant attention if
everybody concerned did his utmost at all
times to get the best results. But when
for years half the world knocks off its ordi-
nary job and proceeds to ruin the work of
the other half, and as far as possible wipe
it off the face of the earth—well, of course
there is a partial failure of the complicated
machinery. What else could you expect?
Our systems, of government, of com-
merce, of industry, have grown up with the
ages and incorporate their experience. The
world is never still. We experiment, ex-
plore; sometimes go forward, sometimes
hark back; sometimes adopt, sometimes
modify, sometimes reject. Whatever seems
worth trying is tried. In every country
and in every age someone appears who,
either burning with zeal or puffed up with
conceit, wants to tear up the foundations of
all things and build according to his own
plans. For the most part the world listens
tolerantly; heir to the wisdom of the ages,
it knows that out of all he has to propose,
a grain may be worth the testing.
For two things, then, the world must
always be prepared: one, the cry that the
bottom has dropped out of everything be-
cause the machinery has temporarily failed
to meet some extraordinary demand; the
other, the cry that, because of this failure,
the entire • fabric, incorporating the experi-
ence of centuries, should be discarded, and
new and revolutionary plans adopted.
The eighties of last century saw millions
of men unemployed and in want while mil-
lions of acres of land were lying out of use.
It was the great landowner then who stood
in the way of humanity, and it was at
him that fists were shaken while men cried
for idle hands and idle lands to be joined.
Out of that cry emerged presently the
single tax as the great cure. The old, wise
world examined it, decided that this grain
and that were worth testing; and upon
those tests it has been acting ever since.
After that—passing by the brief missions
of the bimetallists and the Fabians—a great
war was fought, and the world saw the enor-
mous power of credit. To-day, therefore,
when the world falls into another of its
great troughs of financial and industrial
depression, the reformer sees the stumbling-
block to progress in the men who might,
they think, give credit and won’t. From a
hundred platforms and soap-boxes it has
been recalled during the last fortnight that
in 1914 and the years that followed, Denison
Miller saw what he thought was the
country’s need, and issued credit to supply
it; with no doubt as to the answer, it is
asked whether it is more important to
finance war than peace. And because the
Commonwealth Bank will not do to-day
under the control of a board what it is said
it did then unc(er the control of a governor,
the bank has clearly passed into the clutch-
ing hand of “the great financial interests”
and “big business,” and is co-operating with
the private banks to oppress humanity.
Now, what was it that the Common-
wealth Bank formerly did? Two things
have been mentioned—it financed the war
and the great wool-marketing scheme, both
by the simple process of “extending credits.”
With regard to the war what it actually did
was to make an exceedingly profitable bar-
gain with the Government to handle all war
loans on a commission of 2 p.c.; and simi-
larly with regard to the wool realisation,
what it did was nothing but sound, orthodox
banking. The wool was appraised, and
“funds received from the Imperial Govern-
ment were used to effect a payment of
90 p.c. of the appraised price for distribu-
tion to the growers within 14 days from
the final date of each series of appraise-
ments”; the other 10 p.c., held for possible
adjustments, was retained at interest by
the Imperial Government. The Common-
wealth Bank did not do then a thing which
it would not be expected and required to
do to-day.
The truth is that sound banking is sound
banking no matter who the owner is, just
as safe navigation is safe navigation whether
the owner is a private co. or the State.
Behind the bank must be confidence; noth-
ing can take the place of that. Public
ownership certainly cannot. For the pur-
pose of this argument it does not matter
a straw whether it was Bavin’s party or
Lang’s party which broke the great Gov-
ernment Savings Bank of N. S. Wales.
Whoever did it the. fact remains that public
ownership did not save it; on the contrary,
public ownership was most obviously respon-
sible for the loss of confidence, followed by
suspension and all the distress and misery
which that disaster produced.
But most of these political gentlemen
who want to reform our banking system
want to do a great deal more than substi-
tute public for private ownership. What
they want is control. And they want that,
not to prevent managements from taking so
much risk with the people’s money, but
to take risks which private control refuses
to take. They call this “extending credits.”
The plain English of that is that they want
to make it easier for people to get hold
of other people’s money. There can be
only one possible result of this. While
things go well, easy credit produces trading
and industrial activity—just as it did in
the days when the Government of N. S.
Wales could call upon the Government
Savings Bank for any odd millions that
depositors had made available. But the
moment the tide turned, the unfortunate
depositors discovered that the easier the
credit the harder the repayment. Nor does
it matter what the source of the credit
may be, whether it is deposits or a note
issue: Mr. Theodore’s note issue is merely a
loan by the people to the bank without
interest. The very reasons for which these
political gentlemen want to get control of
banking make confidence in their system
impossible; and without confidence the
system is doomed, just as assuredly the
G.S.B. of N. S. Wales was doomed the
moment it lost the confidence of its deposi-
tors. Let the people remember this: it is
they whose money is going to. be employed
by the political gentlemen who are not going
to be concerned whether a thing pays or
not; and it is they whose money is going to
be lost.
The more hopeless these political gentle-
men are, the more ambitious they become;
and it was strictly in accordance with
custom that at the very time the Labor
parties were crying out for the nationalisa-
tion of banking, that great illustration of
nationalised banking, the G. 5.8., should be
struggling to reopen its doors and mean-
time paying a dole to its depositors. And
it was strictly in accordance with custom
that Mr. Lang should be denouncing the
gold standard and offering a goods stand-
ard in its place. He and his followers
suppose that banking and currency systems
can be knocked together overnight; they
do not know that the wise old world has
been considering goods standards for hun-
dreds of years, picking out of every pro-
gramme the grains of good seed in the
bushels of chaff, and incorporating whatever
was of value in the ever-changing, ever-
developing system.
Australia has only one answer to give
to all their demands. Because it does put
humanity before profit, it will not permit
Mr. Lang and Mr. Theodore and the rest
of the “nationalises” to get easy access
to the savings of the people. The disaster
of the nationahsed Government Savings
Bank of N. S. Wales, along with the suffer-
ings of its depositors, is too recent an ex-
perience to leave the answer in any doubt.
BEYOND THE PACIFIC.
This account of how they met the financial crash
in Chile, and what followed a Communist rising, is
written for Tub Bulletin by an old British resident
in Santiago.
In Chile we have been living under a mili-
tary dictatorship for the past seven years.
The President, General IbaSez, seemed to be
animated by honest motives, and there were
evidences that the country was making
progress such as it had never seen before.
But Ibanez lacked the requisite political
experience, and was surrounded and sup-
ported by unscrupulous scoundrels, though
very few were recognised as such at the
time.
Until the beginning of this year there was
little, if any, unemployment; but great
programmes of public works were being
carried through on borrowed money. The
total public debt, which in the 120 years
of Chile’s independence had mounted to
only 1800 million pesos, in four years was
increased to 4500 millions.
Then a minor crash came, the results of
the same causes as have reacted upon Aus-
tralia and other raw-product countries. The
diminished profits on copper alone made a
difference of more than 100 million pesos
[peso~6d.] in the Chilean revenue from
taxes on that industry alone. The export
of nitrate of soda, Chile’s
export, decreased from 2,500,000
1,800,000 tons, and the price so , fe "J?
little or no profit remained. Ade
300 million pesos was faced. The Govern-
ment resolved to meet it by retrenc >
reduction of salaries and of en |P loyees,a
cessation of all but the most mdispensa
public works—all this to avoid having re-
course to paper-money, which had its advo-
cates, as always when an easy way out o
such difficulties is sought.
Then came suddenly the great collapse in
New York, with repercussion here and else-
where ; and, coinciding with unrest here and
the keen scarcity of money, owing to the
proceeds of the heavy Government loans
having now become quite exhausted, the
country was plunged into the worst depres-
sion in its history. For the first time in
its independent life of 120 years Chile de-
faulted in payment of interest on the public
debt. .
R was at this time a revolution broke
out, which ended in the deposition of
Ibanez, and a return towards constitutional
government, .under a Vice-President and a
Cabinet, pending an election for President.
When the general election takes place in 10
days’ time this Vice-President, Juan Esteban
Montero, will most certainly be elected
President for six years. He has the support
of all the best elements in the country.
Only about 10 days before President
Ibanez was deposed did the country learn
the full extent of its bankruptcy, and of a
deficit in the budget of about 300 million
pesos. For several years during the dic-
tatorship the Treasury had been publishing
balances showing surpluses when there were
really deficits. The immediate effect of
the disclosures was disastrous on trade and
industry; but with the advent of the new
Government and with State control of ex-
change, preventing the exodus of capital,
a revival has been taking place.
Thousands of wealthy Chilean families
have been living for years in Europe, chiefly
in Paris, on the interest of their investments.
After passing the law controlling exchange,
the Government allowed them a first remit-
tance of 5000 francs and a second one of
1000 francs a month later; after that no
more. All such families, therefore, which
have no investments elsewhere to go on
with, are being obliged to return. The
one liner Reina del Pacifico, just arrived,
brought back 300.
Among the measures adopted by the new
Government to make the budget balance
was a reduction of 30 p.c. on all salaries.
There had already been a reduction of 10
p.c. The added 30 p.c. provoked a great
outcry, and was modified to allow the
lowest-paid to escape. For a year Com-
munist propaganda had been: active. It now
fanned the discontent and declared itself
more openly; and before any definite
decision on the salary “cut” could be
arrived at, a so-called “strike” took place
in the navy, proceeding at once into a
mutiny.
The Communists had been white-antingthe
crews of the Chilean Navy and naval bases,
with the result that on the first of this month
(Oct.) the crews imprisoned their commanders
and officers in solitary confinement, and took
command of the one fleet in Coquimbo at
winter manoeuvres, and of the other in
Talcahuano Bay. The forts at Talcahuano
also joined the mutineers, imprisoning or
ejecting their officers.
In the first three days of the trouble
the Government was anxious lest the army
should also join the movement; but when
satisfied of the army’s loyalty, the Govern-
ment moved rapidly. The forts at Tal-
cahuano were attacked from the rear, on
land, and were captured. The naval base
at Talcahuano, including the Engineers’
College, dry docks, etc., were captured after
severe fighting lasting 10 hours. The mutiny
had broken out on a Tuesday morning. On
the following Sunday the fleet at Coquimbo,
by this time reinforced by the accession of
that from Talcahuano, was attacked by a
loyal Government fleet of 14 aeroplanes.
The men on board, having no officers to
lead them, became demoralised by the
attack. The mutiny had been organised
on the dreadnought Almirante Latorre,
whose crew forced those of the other ships
to join it, against their will in the vast
majority of cases. After the aeroplane attack
the men on the Latorre took to drinking,
having appropriated the liquor from a mer-
chant steamer which they had captured.
A dispute arose then between the large
proportion of the crew which had not
approved of the mutiny in the form it
was made to take and the leaders of the
mutiny, who knew that surrender meant
for them execution. Great confusion fol-
lowed on board that ship; and the rest
of the fleet, destroyers and cruisers,
hitherto kept in sight by the Latorre’s
guns, took advantage of this to slip
away in the darkness, and make for Val-
paraiso, where they surrendered.
A court-martial was at once opened; and
thus far the most astonishing feature has
been the insignificance in numbers of the
mutineers who carried the plot into effect,
and might have succeeded but for the “com-
mandeered” liquor. The Communists, it is
shown, concentrated on one large vessel;
and, having secured control of that, com-
pelled the' others to join in with their
plans.
The whole national position is well in
hand. The Communists, mostly of foreign
origin, are being ( deported; for those who
engaged directly or indirectly in the mutiny
there will, of course, be other and swifter
punishment.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Shadler Contracts and Tin Hares.
This election is more than a contest
between political parties. It is more even
than a contest between systems of govern-
ment. It is, or ought to be, a contest
between ways of living. There was some-
thing inspiring about the early battles which
the Labor party fought. Whether men
approved of Labor’s objectives or not there
was no question about its leaders’ high
ideals. They believed that the workers’
lives should be made brighter, that the con-
ditions under which they toiled and lived
should be made better, that they should
have greater care in sickness and old age,
that their children should have a better
chance in life, and that the terrors of un-
employment could be greatly lessened. They
had no misconceptions about work; it was
a good thing, and what they demanded was
that more of the product of it should go to
the laborer and less to the exploiter of
labor, whatever form he might take. It
was a good policy then; it is a good policy
now.
Those early members of the Labor party
in Parliament were as little self-seeking as
men could be. But soon a change came.
In the N. S. Wales Assembly the pay was
gradually increased from a bare living to
£9OO a year, with pickings and prizes beyond
the dreams of early members. Outside
Parliament the “movement” was burdened
with a host of secretaries and organisers
who went into “the game” sometimes for
what they could do for it; often for what
they could do for themselves. The struggle
among these men for place and power
altered the quality of Labor’s representa-
tives in Parliament and out of it; and the
worker became a person whose chief value
lay in the vote he represented. So we had
Mr. Theodore, Labor’s campaign director
in the last Federal election, promising the un-
. fortunate miners of Maitland, who had been
out for months, that if the votes W’ent the
right way they should have their jobs back
in a fortnight. So we had Mr. Lang
promising at the last election in N. S. Wales
that if the votes went the right way the
unemployment tax would be swept away
and plenty of money- be forthcoming other-
wise to carry on all uncompleted works.
Could any reasonable man expect high
ideals from people who come to the front
in such an atmosphere of intrigue and self-
seeking? It is not merely that to such
men a seat in Parliament, with a prospect
of a seat in Cabinet, is a fine job, to be
hung on to no matter what shifts and
shuffles have to be employed. Even worse
is the character of both the legislation and
the administration we get naturally from
them. Thus we have a Conversion loan put
forward and trumpeted far and wide as
wholly voluntary when it was never inten-
ded to be anything of the sort. And so
we get, at the lowest level of the scale,
a policy of repudiation after repudiation
had been denounced—and the Shadier
contract and the tin hares and the demoral-
ising State Lottery sneaked in under the
pretext of assisting the hospitals.
The whole atmosphere is rotten, and the
only people who can purify it are the
electors. There are, Heaven knows, too
many duds in the parties opposed to Labor,
too many time-servers, too many men to
whom a seat in Parliament is a job. But it
is in the Labor party and the Labor move-
ment that there has been the most
appalling loss of high ideals; there alone
that repudiation, and Shadier contracts, and
tin hares are possible. So it is upon th'e
Labor man that the heaviest responsibility
lies; and he can onfy discharge it by voting
down and out all those who have polluted
and corrupted the finest movement this
countiy ever saw. There are times and places
when the only way to vote for Labor is to
vote against those who are falsely. speaking
in its name.
«
Fritz and His Debts.
All the indications are that Germany, for
the second time since the war, is heading for
national bankruptcy. On the last occasion,
early in 1924, the crash came through infla-
tion of the mark, Germany’s excuse being
that it had been pushed into this evil course
by the necessity for buying foreign curren-
cies to discharge its reparation liabilities.
The money markets of the world w’ere
flooded with German paper—just before the
crash the face value of the issue was
2,504,955,700,000,000,000 marks—purchased in
large quantities by foreign speculators right
up to the end, in the belief that no great
European nation would repudiate its cur-
rency. That means of escaping the foreign
creditor is not available this time. The
German banking system is under super-
vision, and the mark, being on the gold
standard, stands higher than the English £,
which in comparison is worth, only 13s. 7|d.
Nevertheless Germany has been threatening
bankruptcy for a couple of years, and the
drift in that direction seems unstoppable.
And this is not because the nation has been
impoverished by the drain of reparations.
There has been no drain. Germany has not
paid a copper pfennig of its own money.
It, has first borrowed from creditors eveiy
cent it has repaid them, and for every 20s.
it has borrowed to pay reparations it has
borrowed anything up to 10s. for its own
national purposes—the perfectly necessary,
commendable and respectable purposes of
industrial development, improvement of
communications, housing, etc.
Side by side with the huge governmental
loans for reparations and development, Ger-
mart industry has been fed by a bounteous
stream of foreign private loans. It has
been possible for the foreign supervisors of
German finance to keep tab of the public
loans, but the private liabilities are more
elusive. A couple of weeks ago the short-
term liabilities—almost all private debts—
were estimated at £400,000,000. A few days
later it was blandly disclosed that they
amounted to £600,000,000. These cannot be
paid. The Reichsbank has gold only to the
extent of 12 per cent, of its note issue. There
is a show of budget balancing, but it is
palpably an equivocal sort of business.
Wages are reduced and taxation imposed on
one hand, but on the other hand the earn-
ings of railways and other public utilities,
earmarked for reparations under the Dawes
Plan, and important contributions to Gov-
ernment revenue in any case, are reduced.
The position reached, whether by design
or accident it is hard to say, is that Ger-
many can be kept solvent only by large
further loans, and it has very little to fear
if it does not stay solvent. The factories,
the bridges, the roads, the great stadiums
and elaborate “workers’ settlements” which
were built with borrowed money can’t very
well be rooted up. Putting in bailiffs is not
practicable. France occupied the Ruhr.
Within six months the whole district was
on strike, and all France got was the privi-
lege of paying the costs of the attempted
execution of the distress warrant. Germany
won't pay her debts, and nothing that has
hitherto been tried has altered that attitude.
The blunder was in not setting a time-
limit to the payment of Germany’s repar-
ations bill. Bismarck showed the way. Paris
fell on January 25, 1871. Bismarck fixed the
little bill for indemnity at £200,000,000 and
announced that German troops would stay
in France till it was paid. The first instal-
ment was handed over on July 14, and a
large detachment of German troops went
home. Other instalments went to Germany
in quick succession, and German soldiers
followed them, and by September 5, 1873,
the whole debt was paid and France owned
herself again. It is a question whether it
isn’t too late now to do the right thing.
Reparations for war damage are valuable
to the recipients in direct ratio to the
shortness of the period within which they
are paid. Neither the Treaty of Versailles,
the Dawes Plan nor the Young Plan offered
Germany’s reparation creditors more than a
dim prospect that if they lent Geimany
enough money to pay its liabilities in the
first 20 years or so after the war, a benevo-
lent German posterity might some day
liquidate the debt and the interest on it.
After 13 years’ experience of how the process
works, that dim prospect recedes into invisi-
bility.

Making a Jest of Federation.
The new Federal authority should not
permit so much as a month to pass without
taking in hand the persistent encroachment
of States upon the Federal principle. A
main object of our Federation and a main
purpose of our Constitution was to make
trade and commerce between the States
free; but assault after assault has been
made upon that fundamental principle until
to-day the burden put upon Australians who
attempt to trade in two or more States is
almost too great to" be borne.
Take the case of a manufacturer who pro-
poses to establish an Australian business.
Encouraged by the law which promises free-
trade throughout the Commonwealth, he
sets up a factory in N. S. Wales and pro-
ceeds to distribute his goods in the home
State and, say, Queensland. He makes up
his income-tax return and, in addition to
Federal tax, pays on 100 p.c. of his profit
in N. S. Wales. In other words, he declares
that, as far as he knows, he makes the
whole of his profit where he manufactures
the goods. It does not matter in the least
to him where he pays the tax, so long as
he has to pay it only once; he knows that
he cannot make the same profit in two
States. But, notwithstanding that he pays on
100 p.c. of his income in N. S. Wales, the
Queensland taxing authority is entitled to
assess him upon one of various bases; gener-
ally it assesses on the assumption that the
Queensland profit bears the same propoi*tion
to the whole as the Queensland turnover
does to the whole. Though there may be
absolutely nothing to support this proposi-
tion, and though the profit in one State may
bear no relation to the turnover in that
State, yet even that plan of assessment
might pass if the N. S. Wales taxing autho-
rity was prepared to admit that the profit
charged upon as made in Queensland could
not possibly have been made also in N. S.
Wales. But it will admit nothing of the
kind: it insists that, the goods having been
manufactured in N. S. Wales, at least 75
per cent, of the profit is taxable in that
State, no matter what Queensland may
charge. Thus springs the anomaly that, in
addition to Federal tax, tax is paid in two
States on the one income.
There could be no greater violation of
the principle that trade and commerce
between States shall be free; for how can
trade and commerce be free when it is
competent for one State to hit with prohi-
bitive taxation the goods from another
State? Repeatedly the matter has been
before conferences of State officers; but
nothing ever happens—nothing ever is likely
to happen so long as State Treasurers can
get a few pounds more by treading this
great Federal principle underfoot. But
Federal Ministers at least may be expected
to take another view and see that the very
foundations of our Federation are no longer
made a jest of.
State-aided Crime.
The Chief Commissioner of Police for N. S.
Wales recently told his Government that the
State’s laxity in the matter of the importation
and sale of firearms made it difficult for his
men to cope with the growing, tendency of
Australian criminals to use lethal weapons.
He asked that the law should give the
force greater powers to deal with the situa-
tion. A Government occupied with the
grave question of reinstating the tin hare
naturally could not find time to deal with
the trivial complaint.
The situation could easily be remedied.
The compulsory licensing of traders in
firearms and ammunition should be the
first step. At present in N. S. Wales an
idiotic law limits the open sale of firearms
to weapons with a barrel 9in. or more in
length. The idea was to allow free traffic
in sporting rifles and guns, while limiting
the sale without license of those classed
as “concealable,” it being fatuously consid-
ered that anything with a barrel of 9in. or
over was not concealable. Unscrupulous
manufacturers in America and Europe forth-
with flooded the Australian market with
weapons complying with the very absurd
regulations.
Besides requiring the trader to hold a
license, the law should call upon him to
record the description of eveiy firearm
received or issued, with its factory number,
in a book kept for the purpose, this to be
signed by the purchaser as in the case of the
laws relating to the sale of poisons. Every
purchaser should be obliged to take out a
license, and the fee should increase in
ratio to the weapon’s concealability. Pos-
session of an unlicensed firearm should
entail at least a year’s imprisonment with
hard labor; for a known criminal, more.
The vendor of a firearm failing to comply
with the law should be subject to> the same
penalties plus the permanent cancellation of
his license. The Federal Government could
aid materially by imposing prohibitive
duties on firearms of the pistol or revolver
type, since these are utterly unnecessary in
Australia save in the case of the police
and military and for a few other special pur-
poses. The Commonwealth might further
require the surrender of all firearms by
overseas visitors, and impound these until
the departure of the owners, exemption in
bona fide cases being, of course, provided for.
There is unfortunately a serious obstacle
in the way of such a necessary policy.
Labor Governments in Australia generally,
and in N. S. Wales particularly, pander
assiduously to the voting power of the
criminal classes and the not inconsiderable
section of the community which, while not
actually criminal itself, is more or less
openly in sympathy with those that are.
It, would be absurd to suggest that the
great bulk of Labor’s supporters approve
of anything of this sort. They are quite
as respectable as their political opponents.
But the political Labor movement does not
represent the real opinions or the domestic
habits of the bulk of the Labor voters.
The tin hare and the vicious atmosphere
in which it lives are both abominable to the
average highly respectable Labor voter. He
has, however, let things pass out of his
control.
♦
Cultivating a Distaste for Work.
Among the Lang Government’s many sins
of commission the State lottery now takes
a front place. Apart from the moral aspect
of a revenue-producing scheme which entices
the community to do what, except for
special legislation, is a misdemeanor, the
official gamble is rapidly slipping through
the fingers of its promoters and becoming
non-official, its activities being extended and
supplemented by private enterprise until it
is almost impossible to see where its rami-
fications will end.
As soon as the original ramp opened,
several wideawake individuals created lot-
teries within lotteries, the prizes for these,
to which shilling subscriptions were invited,
being a State ticket costing ss. 3d. The
scheme caught on so briskly that it is out-
growing the parent that spawned it, offering
as it does a chance of sharing all the State
prizes from £5OOO downwards at a fifth of
the cost of the State ticket. Promoters,
buying large numbers of State tickets and
making each the prize for a shilling lottery,
are obviously on one of the best get-rich-
quick wickets yet discovered by those folk
desiring to get as much as possible for next
to nothing. A vain attempt to stay this
encroachment on its privileges by the. State
has produced the legal opinion that under
its own legislation the lottery can be thus
exploited by outsiders to the dizzy limit.
Tradesmen are accepting dole tickets in pay-
ment for lottery tickets, charging a premium
on the latter. Cheap restaurants are offer-
ing regular clients a chance of eating then-
way to a weekly lottery ticket. Tailors are
giving the magic slips away with clothing
purchases. Hotelkeepers advertise special
brands by adding a ticket to purchases over
a fixed minimum. Children at the primary
schools are “investing” their pennies in
shilling lotteries for a share in a single State
ticket. Everywhere grows this great and
most perilous evil of cultivating a distaste
for hard work, and of offering some other
way to comfort.
Ostensibly founded for the benefit of the
hospitals, the sole result of the unedifying
ramp has been to accelerate the general
shiftlessness which, begun by unemployment
and the dole, is infecting an unpleasantly
large proportion of the population of all
Australia. The sordid gamble is breeding an
attitude of fatuous irresponsibility and un-
heeding disregard of what the future may
have in store which is entirely characteristic
of the mental processes of the politician who
planned the scheme, or at least permitted it
to be launched in his discredited name.
♦
The British Manufacturer.
If Australia is to have closer preferential
trading relations with Britain—to the dis-
advantage, of course, of other nations—wc
shall be much more interested in British
industrial capacity. Much as we might like
to believe that Jno. Bull, manufacturer, is as
well equipped as any in the world, the figui’es
won’t let us. In the cotton industry the
number of looms in Britain is 693,000; in
the U.S.A., 699,000. But whereas 84 p.c. of
the American looms are automatic, one
skilled operative tending 60 looms, in Britain
97 p.c. are ordinary, requiring one skilled
operator to every four looms—these are
the figures of the International Cotton
Federation of Manchester. Compared even
with Japan, where labor is cheap, the British
figures are thoroughly bad: Japan has one
automatic loom to four ordinaries; Britain
has only one automatic to 48 ordinaries.
The same tragic figures are to be found in
the records of the coal and the iron and
steel trades. Of British coal only 23 p.c.
is mined by machinery; in the U.S.A., over
70 p.c. And whereas 65 p.c. of the British
iron and steel output is basic open-hearth
steel, 85 p.c. of it is of that class in the
U.S.A.
Britain has been losing her export trade
because she has not been able to compete
in price with her rivals; and that is largely
a matter of equipment. Why hasn’t she
got it? The answer will probably be found
in the set which has been made during the
last few years both in Britain and in Aus-
tralia against large profits, no matter how
made. The struggle for years past has
been to cut down returns to capital, on the
utterly mistaken assumption that the less
capital receives the more there must be for
the worker. The truth is that most of the
so-called profit which capital makes above
3 p.c. as an average—the amount of coui’se
varies—is put back into industry. The aver-
age “capitalist” lives much less expensively
than the average man on a large salary;
his dividend often goes back direct into
some subsidiary industiy, and the bulk of
his profit never leaves the business which
made it—it remains there to add to build-
ings and plant and machinery and stock.
Of recent year's in Britain and in Australia,
because he has been denounced from a
thousand soap-boxes as a bloodsucker, indus-
trial laws have hit him (“Of course the
industiy can afford more wages—look at its
profits!”), and his attenuated earnings have
been cut into by a multitude of taxes. So
the fund from which money should have
been drawn to provide for new and improved
plant has almost dried up, in Britain especi-
ally; as the out-of-date equipment has lost
the country more and more orders, more and
more men have been thrown idle and the
tax-burden has been made still heavier; and
so the thing has gone on in a vicious circle.
♦
Safety Through the Senate.
In the fierce struggle between Mr. Scullin’s
faction and Mij. Beasley’s, and in the
attacks of these old friends on the Opposi-
tion, the Senate election is seldom men-
tioned. Yet it is highly important:
and the faction fighters, most of whom
will no doubt become friends again when
the hospital cases have been removed, look
to have a better chance of getting a
majority in the Senate than in the House
of Reps. They start with seven seats
which, barring accidents, are good for three
years; and Duncan’s resignation to contest
Warringah “as a protest against machine
politics” (the gentleman has been a machine
politician all his days) will give them
another, for a few months at least. If they
can cany four States they will be in a
position for the next six years to assure
the passage of any measure for political
control of banking, or to make things un-
pleasant for any Ministry that may be
formed by their opponents.
Mi - . Scullin has acknowledged, as if it
were something to be proud of, that his
extraordinary Government did not start
economising in earnest until it was in immi-
nent danger of having to tell pensioners
and. civil servants that there was only
enough in the Treasury to pay them 12s.
in the £. With a majority in the Senate
it would undoubtedly have put through a
bill for the “nationalisation” of banking,
which, as Mr. Theodore says, is the policy
of both Labor factions, and which, what-
ever liars may say to the contrary, means
control of the trading banks that have
been a tower of strength to Australia in
its troubles by the politicians who nearly
ruined it, and one of whom burst the
N.S.W. Government Savings Bank. From
a worse disaster the retiring Opposition
Senators saved us. They are not inspiring
figures, most of them, but they rendered
that great service to their country, nor
can Duncan be denied the credit for his
share in it.
But the disaster of political control of
banking and currency still threatens Aus-
tralia. One sure way of averting it for
six years is to reject all Senate candidates
who support the evil thing, whether they
call themselves Federal Laborites, Lang
Laborites, Independent Laborites, “Straight”
Laborites or plain Communists—in Victoria
the Federal Labor organisation, which is
running three men for the three vacancies,
has instructed its supporters that they must
vote for a Communist in preference to any
U.A.P. candidate.

Bill Mahony gave up his Dailey seat to

describes himself in his nomination paper as
a billiard-marker. Billiard-markers have
their uses, and Edmund Fisher wrote cheer-
ful verses about “the billiard-marker of the
Gin and Cloves Hotel”; but the occupation
is a poor training for national politics. Reid
doesn’t seem to be paying much attention to
this billiard-marker’s yarn.
Queensland’s Moore Government, so firm
in other matters, has finally yielded to the
section of the party which is against the
establishment of an elective Second Chamber.
The Government has done much to drag
Queensland out of the morass in which Theo-
dore and his friends plunged it, but in the
process has had to trample on many corns.
The one-Chamber men, who have learned
nothing from what has happened in N. S.
Wales, affect to believe that, with the altera-
tion of electoral boundaries, their party is
sure to come back. They are taking a- big
risks and subjecting Queensland to a bigger
one.
The Hogans now propose a 10 p.c. jncome-
tax increase instead of the 25 p.c. announ-
ced in September. Of the extra £lBl,OOO
it is hoped to raise, £45,000 ( 24 p.c.) is to be
used to make additions to the infectious
diseases hospital, where there is overcrowd-
ing. The deficit for 1931-32 is expected to
be a little less than the £1,310,000 antici-
pated when the Premiers’ plan was adopted.
Australians visiting Britain during the
general election were struck with the pre-
ponderance of women voters. They were in
the majority almost everywhere, and in the
few districts where the men outnumbered
them it was only by hundreds. Still the
trippers can see the same thing in parts of
their own country. In Victoria there are
more ladies than gents, in 13 of the 20
Federal electorates, and two years ago 13
of the 28 N.S.W. divisions were predomin-
antly feminine. Only in country electorates
throughout Australia does man retain his
voting supremacy; he has had to yield to the
conquering female in the cities.
A common hatred of the Lang plan and
gang has brought old opponents together in
the Scullidore camp. Arthur Griffith, who
stood against Dave Watkins for Newcastle
in 1917; Jimmy Catts, who was unseated
by the younger Riley for Cook in 1922, and
“Jupp” Gardiner, who opposed Theodore for
Dailey in 1928, are now praying for the
return of the men who beat them, and
Jimmy and “Jupp” are candidates in the
same interest. They and Griffith were
admitted without question to the recent
conference of the Scullidore organisation in
Sydney, nor was anv fuss made about “con-
tinuity of membership.”
Scullin and Lang have one point of resem-
blance ; the leadership of each has witnessed
the rending of a Parliamentary Labor party
in twain. But their methods of dealing with
their dissatisfied colleagues were different.
Lang threw out the whole Ministerial pack
and furnished himself with a fresh lot.
Scullin, when some of his men drifted away
and others remained to set him at defiance,
merely wrung his hands and made speeches.
And the upshot of it was that the mutineers
dowmed Scullin. The high-handed leader
generally lasts longer than the one who sags
at the knees.
Few things look as certain as that the
Speck will provide Australia with its next
Prime Minister, which may do something
directly or indirectly to tone down the com-
plaints of the smaller States that they never
get a fair deal under Federation. During 150
years U.S. Presidents have been drawn from
12 States only. In 30 years three of our six
States have been levied on for a man to lead
a Federal Ministry, and Tasmania- will make
a fourth. Westralia came mighty near to
getting f. lien on the Prime Ministership
when Forrest was defeated for the leader-
ship of the old Liberal party on Deakin’s
retirement; a single vote decided it. South
Australia is the only State that has never
yet looked like furnishing the leader of a
Commonwealth Government.
The Queensland Government has rung
down the curtain on the State-hinderprise
policy which, fathered in Theodore’s time,
involved the taxpayers in tremendous losses. A
bill introduced last week repeals the Act of
1918; in future no Government will be able
to go in for stations, canneries, trawlers and
the like without passing special legislation.
A Ministerialist asserts that if the history
of some of the State hinderprises were
brought to light the community would be stag-
gered. Well, why isn’t it brought to light?
DAVE: “What about trying this lot, Dad?”
DAD: “Not on your life! That’s the dud
show we tried last year.”
Queensland Labor, which once had a strong
post in Toowoomba, is nowadays too feeble
to put up a candidate for the Darling Downs.
Instead it is trying to oust Arthur Morgan
by instructing its supporters to give their
first votes to Littleton Groom who, with
three standing, went out on the first count in
1929. Morgan’s followers have been asked to
give their preferences to Yeates, the C.P.
nominee. Groom has a strong family connec-
tion at the Toowoomba end of the Downs, and
having been the member for 28 years has a
following in other parts. If the electors have
forgiven his timid association with the
Hughes-Marks cabal that gave us Theodore
for Treasurer he may go back to Canberra,
but Morgan won’t be easy to beat.
Lang’s Reddest friend, Garden, who used
to be a parson of some sort, is now
making a barefaced bid for R.C. support in
Cook on the ground that, as a Sydney aider-
man, he voted against the rating of church
schools. This Garden posed as a patriot
during the war, at least till he was dis-
missed from the Defence Department; then
he turned Communist, went to Moscow,
boasted that “Revolution had stepped on
the stage” in Australia, and stood as a Com-
“To the intense disgust of the ‘sports,’ the re-
opening of the tin-hare joints, which a Minister
declared on November 25 to be ‘of the utmost
importance to the Government,’ has been postponed
till after the Federal polling.”
“Stop, you little beggar, stop! If we let
you go now you’ll lose us votes.”
munist candidate for Sydney at the N.S.W.
State elections. He has figured in many
crazy strikes, every one of which was lost,
and until Lang’s faction took him to its
bosom he spoke with immense contempt of
the White Australia policy. Young Riley,
the sitting member, is one of the native-born,
and has no yearnings for a “black, brown
or brindle” Australia. He went to France
with the A.1.F., but never to Moscow, and
Cook will cover itself with infamy if it
rejects him in favor of the imported inflic-
tion. If it does, Garden’s right to take his
seat will almost certainly be challenged.
Section 44 of the Constitution Act denies
that right to “any person who is under any
acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience
or adherence to a foreign power,” and Lang’s
Reddest friend has said and done more
than enough to warrant the application of
the test.
“Reports I have received from all over
Australia,” said Scullin when he was in
Sydney, “convince me that every sitting
member supporting the Federal Labor
Government will be returned.” Other re-
ports have convinced other people that
the Scullin faction has as good as lost
Rowe (Parramatta), Crouch (Corangamite),
Frost (Franklin), Lewis (Corio) and Jones
(Indi), and that the odds are against Culley
(Denison), Cunningham (Gwydir), Keane
(Bendigo), Lacey (Grey) and McNeill
(Wannon). Moreover Blakeley (Darling),
Curtin (Fremantle), Moloney (Hume),
Yates (Adelaide), Tully (Barton), Riley
(South Sydney) and Theodore (Dailey) are
finding the going rough, nor is Green (Kal-
goorlie) as safe as he would like to be.
And Cusack, who has quitted Eden Monaro
for Cowper, where Page scored 27,556 to
the Labor man’s 8336 in 1928 (he was un-
opposed last time), may already be counted
out, while Holloway’s flight from Flinders;
Bruce’s old seat, to Melbourne Ports
means another loss. On the fateful motion
for the adjournment of the House the Scul-
lidores could muster only 32 votes, so they
will require a clear gain of six seats to
keep going. They haven’t the slightest chance
of getting them.
Lang’s deficit for the current financial
year is now £8,077,300. Payment of six or
seven millions a year in doles is the basis
of his financial troubles, that and the 44-
hour week, for which 48-hour wages are
paid. Lang’s admirers want more dole,
and tell him that he can give anything, being
omnipotent. So far the banks have lent
the broken man enough money to pay wages
with, but they will soon have to tell him
that they can’t go on doing it. An immense
number of people in N.S.W. can’t pay their
income-tax this year unless their banks
give them overdrafts, and if the banks
haven’t the means, or if the security is
hopeless, they won’t lend the money and
Lang won’t get it. It is a favorite theory
of Langites that the wherewithal to meet
their demands will always be produced under
sufficient pressure. The idea is crude. A
similar idea that Lang would produce a
masterpiece of poetry under sufficient pres-
sure would be equally crude.
Theodore has persuaded himself and is
trying to persuade others that the world
depression is a proof that capitalism
has broken down. It is the sort of easy
inference which saves a lot of trouble. Some
calamity takes place during the existence
of something that the typical Theodore dis-
likes. That is proof positive that the thing
Theodore dislikes is the cause of the
calamity, and should be abolished to
make room for something which Theodore
likes. The earmark of the uneasy type of
reformer is that, having identified the sole
cause of man’s troubles, he asks man to rally
round him and give him authority to
remove the troubles at a large salary, which
is to go on if the troubles are not removed.
One result of Lang’s Leg. Council
coup has been to double the number of
women in Australian Parliaments, Mrs.
Longman (Queensland) and Miss May
Holman (Westrajia) having previously
been the only representatives of the sex
among the people’s chosen. Somehow Aus-
tralia has never had much use for the
lady legislator. Mrs. Cowan, wife of a
magistrate, broke the ice in Westralia 10
years ago by defeating the Attorney-General
of the period, but she failed to hold her
seat when the novelty wore off. The
same applies to Miss Preston Stanley, who
served a term in the N.S.W. Assembly. The
British elector is proving much kinder to
women candidates • there are 13 in the
present House of Commons.
In a N.S.W. hamlet between Sydney and
Newcastle a widow with eight children mar-
ried a wudower with 14, and has presented
him with two more. At the present time
12 of the children benefit by child endow-
ment. eight more, along with the parents, are
on the dole, and the old man is about to
qualify for the old age pension. Now, who
wants to leave old New South?
The sort of paper that goes in for smutty
accounts of divorce cases and sex crimes
has never had much of a run in Queensland.
In future it will be completely hobbled.
The new Regulation of Reports Act forbids
publication of anything beyond names of
parties and witnesses, charges and counter-
charges, points of law raised, the summing-
up, the verdict and the judgment. Penalties
go up to £lOOO. The Labor Opposition
fought furiously for the “liberty” of the
press which on other occasions it never tires
of reviling, but all in vain.
“Mr. Anstey, who preached the ‘default and be
damned’ policy, to the great embarrassment of Mr.
Scullin, while that statesman was abroad, and was
voted out of the Ministry in March, says he is
‘still standing solidly behind the Ministry’s great
principles.’ ”
“As I was saying, Jimmy, ‘Solidarity for
ever.’ ”
During their campaign Scullin and Theo-
dore poured contempt upon the people who
used to laugh at “Fisher’s flimsies.” Well,
considering that, though they “promise to
pay the bearer One Pound,” the best you
can get for them in gold is about 11s. 6d.
“flimsy” doesn’t seem to have been a bad
guess.

THE SOAP-BOX
An attempt to answer some of the questions asked by correspondents.
The Farmer and Protection
Our only hope of making our farms and
stations pay is by reducing our costs, and
we cannot do this while the manufacturer
and his employees are profiteering at our
expense. As the tariff goes up, so do prices,
and the only way of forcing them to manu-
facture cheaply is by reducing the tariffs
to reasonable limits. Another thing—what
is your answer to the undoubted fact that
our best customers are trying to do without
our goods on account of our tariff policy? —
E. O. B.
This is a large subject to get on to in a
couple of inches. (1) Wheat and wool
farms are not the only ones. For every
Australian who grows wheat, wool, etc., for
export, more than two get employment
growing vegetables, fruit, milk, butter, cheese
and honey, besides wheat and wool, for home
consumption; and two-thirds of the con-
sumers are chiefly maintained, directly or
indirectly, by secondary industries. (2)
Low tariffs or no tariffs don’t mean cheap
goods. Oils, including petrol, have always
been low-tariff or no-tariff in Australia; and
the Australian farmer has always had to
pay very dearly for them. The U.S.A. tariff
is high on autos, and farm plant; and
nowhere else in the world are they so
cheap. (3) The low-tariff or no-tariff
country is an unprogressive country even
for agriculture. N. S. Wales was the poorest
wheatgrower in Australia in its Freetrade
days. (4) It isn’t true that we pay our
foreign interest bill with our exports. We
pay it with the excess of our exports over
our imports. If our imports are so great
that our exports don’t pay for them, no
matter how large our exports may be, then
our exports don’t save us from bankruptcy.
(5) As to “the undoubted fact that our best
customers are trying to do without our goods
on account of our tariff policy,” our best
customers will try to do without our goods
anyhow. Every country is trying to supply
its own needs and avoid buying abroad. But
it would be a fool if it didn’t try to bluff
some advantage out of the people that it is
trying to do without.
The Ninety-and-nine
The Bulletin (18/11/’3l) says that the
Scriptures tell us it were better 99 guilty
men should escape than that one innocent
man should suffer. I can’t recall the pas-
sage, but have seen something like it attri-
buted to Queen Catherine the Great of
Russia. —T. A.-
Quite right. The nearest the Bible gets
to it is in Luke xv —“there shall be more joy
over one sinner that repenteth than over
ninety and nine just persons that need no
repentance.” Probably Catherine said it; it
occurs in the proverbs of almost every
country. Dent’s two-Vol!. (dictionary of
proverbs and quotations, the most recent
publication of the kind, merely reports the
proverb without authority.
Who Fixes Exchange Rates'*
It was quite evident that recently there
was a struggle of conflicting interests over
the rate of exchange, and apparently some
banks wanted to maintain it or send it
higher, while others were opposed to that.
How does it come about that there is this
conflict, and what is it that settles the
matter in the end? — Taxpayer.
The banks have no monopoly in dealings
in money; this is evident to everybody who
has ever wanted to raise money on mort-
gage. An English manufacturer buys 20
bales of wool at an Australian sale, and
lias the money in London to pay for it. In
ordinary circumstances he would offer it to
a bank; but if an. outside person, wanting to
pay an Australian bill for goods or interest
in Europe, offered him a higher rate than
he could get at the bank, he would be pretty
certain to sell it outside the bank. Banks
would buy it in London only to sell it
again; and the supply in London (the
proceeds of our sales of exports) and the
demand in Australia- (to pay our interest
for our imports) would in the long run
govern the rate, just as the supply of our
wool here and the demand for it on the
other side govern in the long run the price
for that article —or just as the supply of
cabbages in the market and the strength of
the demand for cabbages govern the price of
the vegetable. No doubt prices of all things
are manipulated more or less; but if the
price of cabbages threatens to fall to-morrow,
it is very difficult to persuade holders of
cabbages not to take the best price offering
to-day. There are various reasons why
different banks should view the matter dif-
ferently. One might have bought a great
deal of Australian money in London at a
high rate and would lose heavily if it had to
sell in Australia at a lower rate. Or it
might believe that the interests of the bulk
of its clients in Australia would be best
served by a high rate, while another might
believe that the interests of the bulk of its
clients would be best served by a low rate.
But the manipulation, or control, could only
have a temporary effect; though it is not
possible to say exactly what “temporary”
means in that connection —it all depends
upon the strength of the control. Thus if
ic were strong enough to buy all the Aus-
tralian money offering in London at a high
rate, Australian buyers (importers and Gov-
ernments and others having interest pay-
ments to meet) wohld have to pay whatever
price was demanded by the monopoly.
Australia and Reciprocal Trade
If I take the late British election aright,
it is a swing-over to a policy of Freetrade
within the Empire and Protection toivards
all else. Under the present tariff John
Bull has been drifting, and consequently
something had to be done; also we Aus-
tralians have been hard put to it to market
our produce, and it appears to me that the
present proposition for reciprocity gives at
least fair promise of success. Therefore, l
cannot see why The Bulletin should be
against Mr. Thomas's mission. —D. E. D.
The Bulletin isn’t . “against Mr.
Thomas’s mission.” But it is a little afraid
of it. The Australian is a big, generous
chap, always inclined to give away far more
than he can afford, and terribly afraid of
being thought mean or ungenerous. Put
that sort of person up against a very keen
bargainer from Britain, whose overwhelming
idea is to restore prosperity to Britain, and
there is a grave danger that we shall not do
ourselves or our future justice.
Bimetallism
Some words have become tyrannical.
‘‘Gold” is one of them. Two nations estab-
lish d, comer and its price soars up to the
sky. The miserable producers of all the
commodities without which man could not
exist must be content with the few scattered
grains of gold which so far have not been
swept into the “corner.” Naturally these few
grains are very unsatisfying. Sooner or
later man finds a way to destroy all tyran-
nies. This monopoly has been man-made.
Let us break it. We can place another
price token alongside gold—as a corrective.
Not paper, which we can play tricks with,
but one which requires substantial labor to
produce and therefore has intrinsic value,
and is scarce enough to necessitate diligent
pursuit. —R. Bake.
The Bulletin has always had a regard
for bimetallism; but the difficulty it sees
now is that silver would go the same way
as gold. Something more is called for.. The
Genoa Conference, greatest of all inter-
national monetary consultations, held soon
after the war, declared that what was needed
was “the closest co-operation between nations
interested in maintaining the gold standard.”
It was alarmed at the prospect of a gold
scarcity. It saw no reason why each
country should hold a stock; it proposed
that gold exchange standards should be
adopted by most countries, leaving only a
few to hold the ultimate metallic reserves
for the entire world. McKenna, so often
quoted nowadays, declared the purpose “un-
deniably sound.” But the plan, put into
operation in various places, was soon
departed from, and these countries proceeded
to “unprofitably use their foreign assets in
the purchase of gold reserves.” They ignored,
he says, “our most recent experience that,
even in a gold-standard country, gold need
no longer be the con-
trolling factor in the
supply of money.”
Bimetallism alone does
not promise to be a
complete solution of
the world’s monetary
difficulties; the best
hope lies in the ex-
tension of the Bank
for International Set-
tlements, which was
established a couple of
years ago at Basle
(Switzerland) “to in-
ternationalise money:
to act as a vjprld’s
Central Bank, a re-
pository for its gold,
and to issue a common
currency.”
Exchange and Money
How will a high ex-
change rate “pile up
funds in London,”
considering that, the
amount we receive in
sterling for our ex-
ports is not affected
by the rate of ex-
change?—P. H. B.
Well, if it doesn’t
pile up funds in Lon-
don, a high exchange
rate fails to do its job.
That job is said to be
twofold: (1) to en-
courage production and
export; (2) to dis-
courage imports. It
does both. What our
production brings in
sterling in Londo*A
does not matter to the!
producer; what he is' l
concerned about is the'
money that comes into
his hand. If a high
exchange rate makes
that money more, he
will produce more and
export more. And the
same high exchange
rate compels many im-
porters, of raw ma-
terial and finished pro-
ducts alike, to cut
down their purchases,
which means a reduced
drain on the payments
we have received in
London. So a high
exchange rate piles up
funds in London —with
the result that pre-
sently the rate can
only be supported by
artificial means, such
as bank purchases in
excess of demand.
Scullin and Protection
During the past few
years The Bulletin
has co nt in uously
issued warnings that
our adverse trade bal-
ance would lead to a
crisis. Oov e r nments
paid no heed to your
warnings and the in-
evitable happened.
Then a- man arose who,
by the adoption of
your policy, saved the
iountry from a fate far
worse than that of to-
day. But you do not champion his cause,
which is yours also. To be consistent with
your past policy you must advise the people
to return Mr. Scullin to power so that
he may continue Ms tariff policy, which
will eventually return all our unemployed to
production. There is no other way. Scullin
has not got and is not getting a fair go.
Now is your opportunity to make good a
great wrong! —A. Le L.
Scullin’s case has already been put in the
balance and weighed very carefully. On the
one side was the Protectionist tariff, for
which he and Fenton and Forde were chiefly
responsible. For that, haphazard and un-
scientific as it was in spots, they had earned
the gratitude of The Bulletin ; Forde’s
work has been particularly good. But there
was not much else to be thrown into that
scale. The balancing of trade did not count.
Anybody can balance both trade and budget,
the former by prohibiting imports, the latter
by piling up taxes. Scullin did both. There
is nothing in prohibiting imports if you
don’t replace them with home products. But
there is far less factory work in Australia
to-day than there was three years ago. In-
stead of making friends for Protection,
Scullin by joining other things to his tariff
policy has thrown Protection back for many
years. In the face of the tremendous fall
in prices of all our export staples, Scullin
and his colleagues tried to maintain the old
nominal rates of wages fixed in. times of
high prices, and thereby made it impossible
for tens of thousands of Australians to get
a job; as The Bulletin said last week, he
would not face the facts. The much more
adroit and much less scrupulous Theodore
said in effect, “If the blind fools insist on
having the same wages as. they used to get,
why make a fuss about it? Pay them in
depreciated currency.” Hence his note-issue
schemes. Scullin, overborne by Theodore,
consented. And that was a third failure to
turn the scale against him.. No, Protection-
ists have, on balance, nothing to thank the
Scullin Government for; instead they have
to blame it for making the policy less
popular than it has been any time in the
last 20 years.
McKenna and the Lang Plan
The Bulletin has been quoting Reginald
McKenna, ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer,
in support of its monetary theories, and now
Beasley quotes him in support of the Lang
Plan. Has McKenna somersaulted, or what?
—F. R. Younge.
Like most other people, McKenna wants
to see changes in our banking system. But
he has no doubt at all about the overwhelm-
ing advantages of the gold standard —the
’very thing which the Lang Plan attacks.
“It is,” he wrote, “a real advantage to a
nation to have a currency founded upon a
value which is universally recognised; it
inspires confidence and facilitates interna-
tional transactions. Even if the gold stan-
dard were not preferable for other reasons,
its universality would be decisive in its
favor. There is no single nation, as far
as I know, which is now off the gold stan-
dard that does not regard the return
to it as the most desirable of all financial
measures.” That puts an end to all doubt
as to where McKenna stands with regard
to the gold versus the so-called goods stan-
dard.
Exchange and Taxation
Does a high rate of exchange really in-
crease taxation? It sems to me that with
a low rate of exchange you may pay less,
hut the money has a higher value. — Emco.
Take the case of Smith, an ordinary tax-
paying citizen, accountant at a sausage
factory. He is on a good salary. All he
knows about it is that, even if Australian
money has depreciated, he hasn’t got more
of it. And he doesn’t know anyone among
his friends who has got more. But he knows
that he has had to pay more in taxes; and
he can see that one reason why more taxes
are wanted is that exchange is costing us
about 10 millions a year. Of course, there
are people who have got more by reason of
the high exchange rate. But they are not
paying all the extra cost. It is doubtful
whether those who are benefiting by the
high exchange are paying one-tenth of the
extra taxation which the exchange on the
public debt calls for. Which means that
those who are getting no benefit are paying
most of the tax.
Our National Credit
We ought to he able to make better use of
our national credit. As loans fall due, why
not pay them, off in full or part by the issue
of fiduciary notes, the interest saved to be
placed in gold reserve to gradually redeem
the notes f The proposal, as it seems to me,
would be in no way inflation, as our liability
would be definitely reduced. — Interested.
The notes would not carry interest. Then
who would hold them? If you compelled
people to accept them in payment for goods
or services, they would soon be at a dis-
count, because people would put up their
prices if they were going to be paid in non-
interest bearing notes. For practical pur-
poses it would be a scheme for loan-con-
version at no interest at all, because people
whose loan was maturing would be paid in
non-interesting-bearing paper, which, as
shown above, they would be able to get rid
of only at a discount.
CLEARING OUR SELECTION.
“All anti-Labor parties at the elections are insistent on the necessity for deporting Red trouble-
makers, even if it is necessary to provide legislation for the purpose.”

“Old Hand”: I sec that in North Sydney
last week “fifty stalwart admirers .surprised
and gratified Mr. W. M. Hughes when they
lifted him shoulder-high, put a Digger’s hat
on his head and bore him in triumph
through St. Thomas’s Hall amidst the
plaudits of the crowd.” These spontaneous
demonstrations take a deal of rehearsing if
unpleasantness is to be avoided. I remem-
ber joining in a warm-hearted attempt to
carry an East Sydney candidate shoulder-
high, the decision having been made on the
|P«r of the moment over a few drinks.
Result—the candidate, who had won prelims
at the Stadium in his day, knocked one
admirer unconscious and ruined another’s
false teeth, under the impression that he
was being made the victim of a mass assault.
Mr. Hughes would have run like a hare in
the old West Sydney days if 50 (or for that
matter five) stalwarts had advanced on him

certain not to drop him must be chosen for
the key positions, no drink must be taken,
clock-work punctuality is insisted on, the
Digger hat must fit and be free from germs.
It recalls that I once saw directions to the
secretary of a racing club: “H.R.H. will
arrive before the second race. As the
National Anthem strikes up, loyalists, to the
number of not less than 25 ( who can easily
be secured by the issue of free tickets), will
move amongst the crowd calling loudly for
three hearty British cheers. A spontaneous
demonstration in front of the Royal box
will take place during the luncheon hour.
A close watch will be kept by loyalists on
H.R.H. in case he decides to leave before the
last race, in which case loyalists must
immediately give the word to the band, and
lead the cheering from suitable vantage
points.” Our ex-P.M. is understood to have
based his public receptions on Royal
examples, but he wouldn’t be himself if lie
hadn’t turned them into something new and
strange.

“Tarrybreeks” : There was quite a stir in
nautical circles in Sydney when Mrs. Balo-
kovic fired the certificated master of
her yacht, who had charge of the naviga-
tion, on the ground
that she was the
“captain,” there hav-
ing been some con-
flict of authority over
questions of discipline.
Both the lady and the
ship are American,
and under American
law the owner of one-
third of a craft may
be master, without
being required to
know anything about
navigation, so the
“captain” was within
her rights. She had
to ship another sail-
ing master, however,
to take the vessel to
Europe. It recalls
the old days of the
Royal Navy, when it
was exceptional for
captains or other
executive officers to
know anything about navigation. Their
business was to fight the ship, the other end
of it being the job of the “master,” a title
which has long since vanished from the R.N.

“Molls”: Hinkler was evidently luckier
than Kingsford Smith in his experience of
forced detention in a foreign country. Wherl
the latter was forced down in Asia Minor
Turkish soldiers promptly appeared and
took him into custody, and when an attempt
was afterwards made to minimise the inci-
dent Kingsford Smith lust no time in put-
ting the Turkish Consulate in Sydney
straight with regard to the unpleasant
treatment he had received. Hinkler, it
was widely cabled, had also been “arrested”
in Brazil, before his trans-Atlantic flight,
owing to some trouble over a passport or
lack of it. “But,” said the little Bundaberg
man, when asked about it, “I don’t
know if you can call going for walks and
drinking beer with the Governor ‘an arrest.’ ”
Another version substitutes “wine of the
country” for “beer,” but whichever it was it
is pleasant to learn that Brazilian officials
have courtesy and a stirrup cup for the
wandering aviator whom regulations oblige
them to detain. The Turks, of course, if they
are good Moslems, are expected to eschew
strong drink, but there is no record of their
having offered Kingsford Smith a sherbet,
or whatever is the national substitute for the
cup that cheers.
“Stuff”: Queensland has been more or less
edified by some unusual remarks from a
Supreme Court Judge, who had to pass sen-
tence on an old cobber. His Honor, instead
of briefly prescribing the duration of the
“stretch,” entered into a disquisition about
the childhood days of himself and the
prisoner when they had “rin aboot the
braes an’ pu’d the gowans fine,” though he
didn’t actually quote Burns. He added that
this could not deter him from handing out
three years’ hard, but promised that when
the three years had been worked off he would
forgive and forget. If the others present
had tears they were not prepared to spill
them,, and the happening left a strong im-
pression that sob-stuff from the Bench in a
criminal case is out of place, whatever it
may be from the Bar table.

“Quot”: The population of Australia on
September 30 was computed by the Common-
wealth Statistician as a trifle over six and
a half millions. Which is, oil the evidence
of reference books, about midway between
Greater London’s seven millions odd and New
York’s something under six millions. There
are three European countries standing on
about the same population mark as Australia:
Sweden, Austria and Portugal. Perhaps an
incidental better worth noting is that, while
births exceeded deaths by 66,797, departures
from this country exceeded arrivals by
10,444. But many of the comparatively
newer lands have the same tale to tell
these times, even the U.S.A. Where the
European immigrant is mostly heading for
these times, now that Uncle has put up
the quota barriers, is hard to say. Most
likely he is remaining at home in larger
quantities than ever before—and making
things worse there.

“Cosmos”: Mark Ilambourg gave Aus-
tralia some justifiable digs in London “Daily*
Telegraph” last week (the bridge—“a
glorious piece of extravagance”; our concert
balls-—“splendid in everything except acous :
), and one which showed his ignorance ;
‘Melba was a national heroine because she
was the only Australian to become a world
figure.” Nine inhabitants of China, Japan,
India, Russia, Arabia, Africa, the Middle East
and even possibly Western Europe know some-
thing of Kingsford Smith for every one who
has heard of Melba. An artist’s fame is
extraordinarily limited. The average Lon-
doner had never heard of Calve when
Parisians were putting her ahead of Melba,
and I have met intelligent French people
who had never heard of Melba. Paderew-
ski wasn t. widely known outside the luxury
quarters of a few great cities till he became
Prune Minister of Poland; and I doubt
if on *jL Pole in three could say, offhand, if
iVlr. Ilambourg plays the violin, piano or
oboe. One of Norman Lindsay’s recent
U.S.A. criticisms of Australians was that
they had refused to make a national
heroine of Melba: “They insulted her by
refusing to hang the flags at half-mast when
she died.” It showed their sense of propor-
tion. Woop-Woop does that kind of thing
when its noblest Mayor passes, but nations
reserve the honor for genuine nationa.
figures. They didn’t half-mast the flags in
England for Irving, though they buried him
in the Abbey.
“Stumer”: Coining is evidently among the
illicit industries pursued with extra keenness
in tight times; the Sydney police are sani
to have descended on no fewer than 14 sets
of persons infringing the Mint’s monopoly
by the manufacture of florins and shillings
during the past 12 months, some of them
first-class artificers. Luckily for the
offenders, the law is a lot more lenient than
it was in the Middle Ages. When I was
trying to master the elements of juris-
prudence, the counterfeiting of money was
usually cited as an example of the malum
prohibitum as opposed to the malum per sc.
a practice not abhorrent in itself, like cer-
tain things forbidden in the Decalogue, but
merely constituted a crime by the require-
ments of civilisation. Nevertheless, the
rough justice of a few hundred years ago
seems to have attached little impoi’tance
to the distinction. In the fifteenth century
in France, convicted coiners were boiled to
death in oil —some of Villon’s boon com-
panions suffered this unpleasant fate —and
the penal laws in England were little milder.
Nowadays the coiner, possibly something of
an artist as well as a chemist, seldom risks
more than two or three years unless he is a
hardened transgressor.

“Adelaide”: The Adelaide “News” has
been fined for publishing “information relat-
ing to the drawing of an illegal lottery”—
in Sydney. The defence was that it wasn’t
Information, and that the sweep, being in
N.S.W., was not Illegal. Both pleas failed,
and a Supreme Court appeal failed, too.

“Holy Joe”: “Because I never smoked a
cigarette, nor indulged in strong drink, nor
had an occasional flutter at the races, my
wife called me a wowser and refused to' live
with me,” a petitioner told the Sydney
Divorce Court last week. He got a divorce
on the ground of desertion, clinching his
ease with the argument that he wished to
marry a young woman in Queensland, who
had borne him two children since the other
lady had faded out of his domestic scheme.
Unless the word “wowser” carries a narrower
meaning than that generally assigned to it.
he seems to have done something to clear
himself of the imputation.

“Erua”: A Sydney dentist was aroused
soon after daybreak the other morning by
a violent assault on his surgery door, e and
opened it to admit a huge' individual,
who demanded the instant removal of
an obstreperous molar. When the victim
was seated in the chair, the dentist, still in
pyjamas, listened to a story of a’ 30-mile
walk to the nearest train-stop, an all-night
journey to the city, and a walk round the
suburb until a dentist who practised at
home and could operate at 5 a.m. was dis-
covered. The operator was arranging liis
implements when the man in the chair''sud-
denly sprang up. “Blime, boss,” said he.
“the cow's stopped aching. I’ll go now and
call in and see yer later.” No persuasions
moved him, and realising it was sheer funk
the dentist let him out and went back to
bed. But the sufferer was seated on the
step when the surgery-door was opened at
nine o’clock. “Gimme the war before that ”
was his sole observation when the ordeal
was over.
THE WORD-SPINNER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“We refrained from cutting pensions and salaries,
from making economies and imposing taxation till we
were in the last financial ditch.”
— Mr. Scullin at Sydney Town Hall.
My forte is oratory, gents.;
My aptitude amazes
For admirable sentiments
In smoothly rounded phrases.
My remedy for raging feuds.
My oil for warring factions,
Is mainly buttered platitudes
And sugary abstractions.
I love my speeches to intone,
To polish them and gloss them;
I leave my bridges well alone
Until I have to cross them.
I never did —and never will—
(He’ll bear me out, Sir Otto)
Aught that might lose me votes until
I’d absolutely got to.
You'll find me blowing hot or cold
As circumstances guide me ;
I like an open mind to hold
Till Safety First decide me.
My projects in my country’s need
For Caucus out I hollow. •
And if they acquiesce, I lead,
And if they don’t—l follow.
I trim my sails to every breeze
And mark each change of weather.
I sent brave words across the seas
To keep my crew together.
Returned I found, alarmed, appalled,
Fell mutiny had got ’em,
And lulled my roar till it recalled
The “sucking dove” of Bottom.
They say I’ve crashed upon my job.
Betrayed the trust assigned me;
They hint the million-footed mob
Is mighty close behind me.
They ask you, with the artless stealth
That cloaks aversion hearty,
How one can run a Commonwealth
Who couldn’t boss a party.
But this is what I’d have you note:
I never was the lad to
Do anything would cost a vote
Excepting when I had to.
And still with scores of South-street gem-
For statesmanship I’m girded,
And comfortable apothegms
Artistically worded.

T. THE R.


“Russet”: What O. Henry calls the
feminine yearning “to whitewash the hideous
veracity of life with a little form and cere-
mony” has apparently found its latest mani-
festation among the N.S.W. lottery girls,
who have been accorded permission to array
themselves in biscuit-colored uniforms at
12s. lid. a time. The State, it appears, isn’t
shouting the new garb, though the benevolent
Whiddon intimated that it would have been
willing to do so if the girls had chosen some-
thing more distinctive. Most people will
hold that the lottery is well enough adver-
tised without borrowing circus methods, but
Whiddon regards biscuit-color as dull. Some
captious people are bringing the same com-
plaint against the slaty hue of the Harbor
Bridge, though there is surely enough violent
color about the foreshores to make anything
neutral a restful change.

“Madox”: Following a raid made by the
police on a gambling den in Tully (N.Q.), 51
names were called in the police court the
next morning. None of the accused appeared,
all forfeiting their bail of £3, but the
writer’s attention was arrested by the diffi-
culty the constable experienced in pronounc-
ing their names. Consider the nationalities:
Australians, 16; Greeks, 8; Maltese, 5;
Russians, 5 ; Englishmen, 4 ; Esthonians, 3 :
Germans, 2; Irishmen, 2; Swiss, 2; and
one each from Scotland, Bulgaria, China and
India. Not an Italian in the mob. The
fact is that Luigi does not gamble to any
extent, having too wholesome a respect for
money.
SOMETHING OF THAT SORT.
LITTLE SISTER: “He’s awfully well-connected. Got quite a family
tree—did you know?”
BIG BROTHER: “No, but I’d heard there was something shady
about him.”
“Brick Court”: It is frequently a fine
point as to what constitutes an accident
arising “out of or in the course of a man’s
employment” when it brings the sufferer
within the shelter of the Workers’ Com-
pensation Act. A Westralian railway
machinist, employed at the Midland Junc-
tion workshops, strolled out on the recreation
ground after ltinch and was struck on the
eye by a cricket ball. He sued the Commis-
sioners, and was awarded £375 for the loss of
the eye and incidental expenses. But the
Westralian Supreme Court set aside the
judgment, ruling that the accident had not
arisen “out of or in the course of employ-
ment,” the inference apparently being that
strolling around where anybody might be
PERCY INVENTED THIS ONE.
MURIEL: “Dad thinks of little but racing and mother of nothing but frocks.”
PERCY: “Then you must be a kind of clothes-horse — ha, ha!”
hit by a flying cricket ball wasn’t a thing
inseparable from the litigant’s job or among
the dangers to which it subiected him. Last
week the High Court upheld this ruling,
though two Judges out of five dissented. H’ow
the claim would have gone if the man had
actually been playing cricket, remains un-
decided. But it would be scant encourage-
ment to employers to provide their hands
with facilities for recreation if they thereby
rendered themselves liable to foot the bill
for everything in the nature of injured limbs.

“Orion”: Commenting on the elaborate
calculations of the astronomers who have
determined the position of an opening in
the roof of Melbourne’s Shrine of Remem-
brance so'that a beam of light shall strike
a certain spot on a certain day for the next
few centuries. “Antrobus” (B. 2/12/’3l)
draws .an unfair comparison when he intro-
duces Stonehenge.. That ancient temple
had movable fittings, and the builders had
merely to wait till sunrise on Midsummer
Day and then lug their stone altar into
such a position that the sun’s first beam fell
on it. But this “trial and error!’ method
was impossible for the Victorian astronomers,
who had a fixed spot to illuminate, and
would therefore have to determine by cal-
culations beforehand the exact position in
which to bore their hole in the roof.

“Sero”: The candidate who just misses
the ’bus with his nomination paper may be
looked for at every election as confidently
as the “Derby dog” on Epsom Downs. One
would-be Victorian
legislator reached the
post last week at
breakneck speed,
waving the documen-
tary evidence of his
mission at the re-
turning officer, and
was desolated to find
himself ten seconds
behind time. Some
candidates post their
nomination papers,
but it is a trifle
risky, for even in the
P. and T. depart-
ment accidents hap-
pen. Many years
ago a closely-con-
tested election on the
Westralian goldfields
was upset owing to
certain informalities,
and the candidate
who had been a short
head behind confi-
dently expected to
reverse the verdict.
He mailed his nom-
ination from Perth,
but it was never de-
livered and no trace
of it could ever be
found. So the other
fellow had a walk-
over, and the non-
starter had no re-
dress ; he couldn’t
prove that he had
been the victim of
o ffi ci a 1 negligence.
Some years later a
Westralian Labor
member was a little
luckier. His posted
nomination had like-
wise arrived too late,
but it did arrive by
the next mail, and
there was so much
doubt as to whether
the di 1 a toriness
hadn’t been the fault
of the department
that a legal gent, ad-
vised him to make a
claim for damages.
He threatened one, and the department came
back with an offer of £IOO compensation,
which was promptly accepted. He had had
a very poor chance of being re-elected.

“Herbertshoe” : This German craze of
nature cult”, is no new thing. It is a good
many years since I first met an exponent of
it—August Englehardt, whom many old New
iiumea and 1 apuan hands wilj, remember as
the founder of a colony sworn to Nacht-
Jcultur. He set up his kingdom on the little
island of Kabakon, midway between the
islands of New Britain and New Ireland in
the Duke of York group. The professed
creed was to abandon clothing and live
entirely on cocoanuts. The colony eventually
went bung through the backsliding of the
disciples, who, after a long spell of cocoanut
Jcai, were apt to embark on a blow-out on
bulamakau, beer, and other tinned or potted
delicacies. Englehardt fought the heresy for
some time until his following discovered that
he too, had been feasting in secret on for-
bidden provender. Last time I saw him,
Englehardt ; had renounced his teachings and
was wearing ,a lava lava, while in one hand
he held a chunk of raw ham and in the other
a long-necked bottle of black lager.

“Nakh.”: Eminent scientists in Calcutta
are reported to be mystified at the perform-
ance of an Indian yogi who swallowed
cyanide and other
poisons in large
quantities without
showing any ill
effects. As the test
was under the strict-
est supervision it is
described as a defi-
nite challenge to
modern science. I
knew a planter in
Borneo who used to
perform a similar
miracle. He had
malaria very badly,
and the stiffest doses
of quinine had no
effect, so he started
feeding himself on
arsenic, gradually
i n c r e a sing the
amount. In the end
he could throw
down enough of the
poison to finish half
a dozen men without
turning a hair. To
take the opposite
case. A woman who
was a morphia ad-
dict was admitted
for treatment to a
Melbourne institu-
tion, where the
doctor gradually re-
duced her allowance
by substituting more
and more of a harm-
less powder in her
periodic dose. With-
out knowing it she
had been taking noth-
ing but the powder
for some time when
she suddenly got
tired of being saved
from her vice and
cleared out. The next
hoard of her was
that the coroner was
sitting on her body,
which had been
found in a boarding-
house. With the
return of her ornv-
x etui Ai \jx uui uiav
ing she had gone back to the morphia
and had taken her old dose. Instead of
giving her a mild kick it had killed her stone
dead.

“Trude”: “C.Q.,” commenting on the
vagaries of the Melbourne climate (B.
2/32/’3l), says that there was snow a foot
deep on the Dandenong Ranges in November,
but, except for a few flakes not worth men-
tioning, no snow fell there throughout
the month. If “C.Q.” had chosen the rainfall
to bring out his point he would have been on
safer ground. At Kalorama nearly 7$ inches
of rain was recorded during November,
making a total of 56 inches for the 11
months.
* * * *
“Pink Tape”: There was one of those
cases at the Sydney Criminal Court the
other day in which everybody was sorry for
the prisoner. He had got away with £39,000
belonging to two coal cos. whose business
affairs he had managed, the thefts running
six years and being hidden behind forgery,
falsification of accounts and other offences.
Through all this period the man had kept
the respect of Sydney’s best business heads;
he wasn’t a gambler; he just lived as you
would expect a very successful business man
to do in a very respectable and rather ex-
pensive suburb. No defence was made; the
police said he had given them every pos-
sible, assistance and had made every pos-
sible reparation. It looks to have been
merely another case of collapse after
domestic applause. The moment a man gets
to love the household hosanna, to love to
hear that daddy is the best and most generous
daddy in the world, that moment he begins
to dig a pit for himself. The knowledge
that a man may get six years of gaol for
it, on top of six years of hell before the lid
blew off, ought to bring the less impression-
able dad a ray of comfort.

“Lao-dah”: .The Australian accent has its
drawbacks, but at least it has the advantage
of being so distinctive that few people ever
mistake the nationality of the owner. That
isn’t always so with other patois. The
following appeared in the leader columns of
the “Straits Times,” Singapore, recently:—
Will those who ring up the “Straits Times” and
receive a reply in a broad Scottish accent please
refrain from saying, “Can you put me through to a
European ?” It’s a bit hard !
* # * *
“Bonifacio”: Juries take no chances nowa-
days if they can find some excuse for a
killer or extenuation for a killing. Rarely
is the death penalty inflicted —they are not
going to see the black cap donned if they
can help it. And they generally can. The
other day a man stood his trial in Sydney
for waylaying and killing a helpless girl who
had refused to keep company with him any
longer. Such defence as was raised was as
unconvincing as it was uncorroborated. He
had bought the revolver to kill himself; when
he told her of his intention she seized him
by the arm and in the struggle the weapon
exploded; in other words the shooting was
accidental. If the jury had believed that, it
was their duty to acquit; being clearly
unable to believe it, they compromised by
bringing in a manslaughter verdict. That
the man was of good character and obviously
half-crazed with jealousy outweighed in their
eyes even the damning evidence of deliberate-
ness shown by two shots having been fired,
both of which had taken effect. The Judge,
after commenting on the jury’s leniency,
made it ten years—which is possibly a little
less than the death sentence would have been
reduced to if the major verdict had been
returned. It is one argument for the aboli-
tion of capital punishment that at least it
would save such amazing findings as this
one.

“Centurion”; Kings are not the only
potentates who never carry money about
with them (B. 7/10/’3l). One well-known
A.I.F. brass-hat was like that, and many
was the free lunch and dinner he scored at
the expense of some unhappy junior. But
the outstanding example, perhaps, was an ex-

“Maiden’s speech! Good gracious, no! I’m a widow.”
Englishman who at one time held several
high military jobs in Australia. On the
extended staff rides which were popular
before the war, he was accustomed to inspect
the work by flitting from cadre to cadre in
a car, accompanied by a couple of subs, as
aides. He made it a strict rule to pull up
at every pub encountered and order a small
bottle of champagne. Equally strict was his
rule of being without money, and the
unfortunate underlings who footed the bill
soon came to realise that they had kissed
their cash good-bye. Before his idiosyn-
crasy became known there was keen competi-
tion to accompany him on his joy-rides.
Later on it was often necessary to administer
the ominous warning “that’s an order” to
the mutinous juniors detailed for the honor.

war-time business in Horseferry-road, and
developed it so successfully that in ’lB they

his mark and his money as a newspaper
thereby following the lead of the
late ,L W. Hackett. Lovekin, who came
from Kent, struck Westralia in the ’eighties.
He helped to launch the Perth “Morning
Herald” in 1896, got out of it in good time

"West Australian”) and presently acquired
the evening “Daily News” along with some
partners, whom he bought out. The “News”
brought him a fortune, materially helped by
astute deals in newsprint during the war.
He sold out to a company five years ago.
Lovekin always had political aspirations,
but they weren't gratified rill after his rival
Hackett’s death ; he sat for the Metropolitan
Province from 1919 till the end, dropping
into Hackett's place as a man who aimed to
be something of a power behind the scenes
without desiring office.
Christopher James Parr, who was High
Commissioner for M.L. in London in the
days of the Coates Administration, and who
has just been drafted to the Leg. Council as
its leader, is an Auckland lawyer who served
a long apprenticeship on local bodies before
lie entered politics. He became representa-
tive of the Auckland suburb of Eden in 1914,
and six years later Massey made him Minis-
ter of Education, a job which he vacated to
go to London. Like Wilford, the present Com-
Ex-High Commissioner PARR, now Gov-
ernment leader in the M.L. Leg. Council.
missioner, he is a Iv.C.M.G. He prefers the
James to the Christopher for his handle,
but nobody has ever called him “Jimmy.”
A serious-minded and dignified person, he
found the Commissionership and life in
London much to his liking. During his
tenure the overseas office was housed in
the B.M.A. buildings, the facade of which
is decorated by “Epstein’s obscenities,” but
it is doubtful if Parr ever saw them, and
certain that if he did he would never have
taken a second peep.
Vic. western district is mourning Mon-
signor (Dean) Shanahan, who for 45 years
was parish priest of Hamilton, and only
retired from active work a few months ago
at 95. Coming to Vic. in 1864, he was
stationed in turn at Carisbrook, Creswick
and Warrnambool, before being given charge
of Hamilton. Humane and tolerant, he was
held in universal esteem. In his young days
he had a taste for coursing and hunting.
Norman Cowper, whose candidature for
North Sydney on the U.A.P. ticket is
viewed with gloomy disfavor by the veteran
Hughes, is a serious-minded lawyer still in
his early thirties. Incidentally, he is a great-
grandson of the Charles Cowper who was
five times Premier of N. S. Wales between
1856 and IS7O.
Last year Sidney B. Myer played Santa

Hundreds of Australians who have had
the help of Eric MeConnan, manager of the
Strand branch of the -National Bank in
London, were shocked last week to read
that his dead body had been found in the
street outside his hotel —he had fallen from
an upper-storey window. MeConnan, who
was still only in his middle thirties, con-
tracted malaria in the w T ar, and ever since
had been subject to excruciating attacks of
headache. Temporarily demented by one of
these it is surmised that he threw himself
out. It wms a tragedy, for in health Eric
MeConnan was a cheery soul, who loved his
work and the opportunities it offered for
giving others —Australians especially—a
hand, and he was clearly marked out for a
high place in the service. His brother, to
whom he was greatly attached (he -was
unmarried), is the National’s State manager
in N. S. Wales.
Fritz Hart. Melbourne’s leading conductor
and composer, started off to fulfil an orches-
tral engagement in Honolulu the other day
with the good wishes of local music-lovers
and a cheque in his pocket from the sym-
phony orchestra he has directed so well. As
music gets into the doldrums during the
summer he w’on’t be missed as much as he
might be otherwise.
They get on to the Inky Way by all sorts
of routes. Thirty years ago a small boy in
a Broken ITill hay and corn store w r as called
on as a witness in a petty debts case. Among
those who happened to hear his evidence was
the manager of the local “Barrier Miner,”
who was so struck by his performance that
he forthwith offered him a job as a cadet.
The cadet, Horace Yelland, has for some
years past been editor of the “News,” Adel-
aide’s evening paper; now, having saved up
his pennies diligently, he has bought the
Port Pirie “Recorder,” which stands well
in the front of S. Australia’s country papers.
A. G. Barrett, head of the Vic. malting

cil service to his credit.
Architecture runs in the blood of .Tack
H'ennessy, w r ho leaves Sydney this month to
supervise the erection of the Colonial
Mutual Life’s £lOO,OOO building at Durban
to his own design. His dad came to Aus-
tralia 50 years ago and established the well-
known firm that is now Henuessy and Hen-
nessy. Hennessy fils was born in Sydney
44 years ago; articled at 15 to Sulman and
Power, he studied at the Sydney Tech, and
Sydney Uni., where he scored some high dis-
tinctions. Then he went to San Francisco
and New York, and later to the University
of Pennsylvania, where he obtained his
degree in architecture, joining his father
as partner on his return in 1911. The part-
nership was responsible for the completion
of St. Mary’s Cathedral, and for the designs
for the new R.C. cathedral at Brisbane.
An apprenticeship of service on local
bodies is the recognised road to Parliament
for Maorilanders, and as a rule, they don’t
allow 7 their duties in Wellington to sever
the connection. J. A. Nash, M.P. for Palmers-
ton North, w T as able to print on his election
dodgers the names of 20 boards, councils and
such of which he was a member, and the
proud claim that he was, or had been, the
kingpin of 17 of them. His tally of service
as a member of these bodies, additional to
his 13 years in the House of Represen-
tatives, was 300 years, and his occupancy
of chairs, mayoral, presidential and so
forth, totalled 147 years. Oh, yes—he was
re-elected to Parliament.
F. .T. Brown, dead in Brisbane at 74.
claimed to be the oldest master stevedore
in Australia. He came to Australia from
Kent 55 years ago, and carried on his call-
ing for half a century. His specialty was
wool-handling, and it was his proudest boast
that he had squeezed into the immortal Cutty
Sarlc the biggest cargo of the stuff that
any sailing-ship ever took out of Australia.
Vicars Boyle, who took his last sample
in Brisbane lately, was one of the north-
ern State’s best-known mining men. Born
in Brisbane 71 years ago, he worked in the
Queensland National Bank. When that
institution closed the Georgetown branch,
of which he was head, in 1894, Boyle
took up mine management and w r as connected
with various N.Q. properties, subsequently
going to Victoria, where he was general
manager of the Victorian Star G. M. C. and
various other shows in the boom of 1906.
Four years later he left Australia for a big
job in Nigeria. He returned to Queensland
seven years ago.
There are two Ted Rileys in the Reps.,
father and son. “Old Ted” has held South
Sydney for over 20 years, and “Young Ted”
represents the next-door Labor seat, of Cook.
Young Ted won his spurs with an absolute
majority of nearly 7000. Next election he
increased his lead by 6000. In 1928 he was
over 19,000 ahead of his Nationalist oppo-
nent and in 1929 he scored 34,221 votes to
his rival’s 6409. Opposed to Riley this elec-
tion is Comrade Jock Garden, the shuffling
and smirking ex-parson, who has at one
time or another been a member of practically
every wire-pulling socialistic body in Sydney
from the Communist party to the breakaway
Industrial Labor party formed in 1919. iii

although he resides in South Sydney, a
Labor district, it looked like too tough a
fight, so he picked Cook instead. Young
Riley is up against this great public danger,
and true lovers of Australia are rallying to
give him a hand in downing the national
peril which his opponent represents. In
no other electorate of Australia is it possible
for the result to be so disastrous.

Major-General Sir David Bruce, the dis-
tinguished doctor, whose death in England is
reported, was born in Melbourne 76 years
ago but saw little or nothing of Australia
after early boyhood. After taking his
degrees at Edinburgh he entered the
R.A.M.C. and did notable work for the
Empire and his profession in several parts
of the world, Africa especially, winning a
host of distinctions from various European
societies for his research work. He was in
the siege of Ladysmith, and was one of the
leading authorities on such diseases as sleep-
ing sickness, the tsetse-fly pest, tetanus , and
trench fever.
Commander H. T. Bennett, the new skipper
of Mrs. Balokovie’s yacht, is an English naval
man who has had a varied career. While in
the surveying branch of the R.N. he was
navigating lieutenant of the Merlin when
that ship w T as charting the coast of Borneo.
He transferred to a t.b.d. in time to serve in
the North Sea during the war. Bennett com-
manded a surveying ship of the R.A.N. for
several years inside the Great Barrier Reef.
Then lie got a short job as director of Her-
schell’s film-producing enterprise in Mel-
bourne. He accompanied a private flying
expedition, organised by the “Argus,” which
surveyed Central Australia from the air.
During the last few years he has been draw-
ing from his store of experiences as a radio
lecturer with the A.B.C. A fluent and witty
talker, he should be an.asset to any yachting
violinist’s ship’s company.
Mrs. A. Morgan, of Yackandandah (Vic.),
who has been keeping her 92nd birthday,
was probably the first white child born
between the Ovens and the Murray. Her
father, Geo. Kinchington, crossed the river
at Albury in 1837 and took up the Big Ben
run. Ills daughter has lived all her long
life within sight of her birthplace, and still
tells of her first trip to Melbourne in her
early ’teens. The journey was made in a
bullock-dray and took two months. Her late
husband, an Englishman, tried his luck on
the Californian diggings in ’49 before set-
tling down to farming in Australia. His
sister. Mrs. Pryke, was the mother of Dan
and Frank Pryke, of Bulolo and Edie Creek
fame.
C. G. Green, who has just retired from the
job of under-sec. of Vic. Chief Sec.’s Depart-
ment, after 41 years in the civil service,
will probably be succeeded by Laurie Chap-

cessors—C. A. Topp. G. C. Morrison, W. A.
Callaway and C. S. McPherson —are still
going strong in “blest retirement, friend to
life’s decline.”

“The Bulletin’s” Moving Day
Sydney’s greatest show in recent times
was The Bulletin’s moving day. When
the news was given out that the paper, with
its “Mirror” and its “Cat,” was going to
move from its cosy but just-a-trifie-dingy
home at 214 George-street North to a much
bigger and brighter cavern a few doors south,
the Oldest Comp, remarked petulantly:
“Dammit, a man
shouldn’t be
asked to root
himself out every
five minutes”’ He
still cherished
memories of the
last shift, from
the “Place” off
Pitt-street that
still bears the
paper’s name,
over 40 years
ago. How right
he was none of
the staff realised,
except Mcßlazes,
who had the job
of mar shalling
“The Oldest Comp.”
the procession.
At first blush it seemed ridiculously simple.
All that had to be done was to put the paper’s
lares et penates on carts or even wheelbarrows
and pass em along to the new abode —a
matter of a few minutes. Instead of -which
Mcßlazes and other stern, silent men spent
weeks in corridors and catacombs whose
existence was only dimly suspected, stagger-
ing out at intervals under huge burdens of
what looked like slabs of soot. They grew wan
and haggard in these researches, but nobody
noticed, because they were always quite
black. Gradually the corridors and landings
of the historic building became cluttered up
with enormous 1 piles of relics, until at last
it became necessary to evict two of the

biggest H’oe print-
ing presses in
order to get room
to turn round. The
Hoes were found
wandering in
Dalley-street by a
kind machinist,
who took them to
the new premises
and fed them with
oil and paper and
ink, so that they
presently revived.
As the moving-
day drew nearer
and nearer the
ominous conclusion
was proned in upon
everybody that
something would
have to be done
about the Books.
By Books is meant
Books —not the per-
sons who lay you 4
to b on Catsmeat, nor ledgers and commercial
records, but just Books. In the British
Museum, according to “10-2-4,” who once
lived there, there is a place where there is
a copy of every book ever published. The
Bulletin office is like that, but worse, since
it has ’em in duplicate, triplicate and quad-
ruplicate. Especially rich is this collection
m devotional works. Little did those pious
folk who dubbed the early issues of the
journal irreligious—little did that zealous
Bather Whatsisname who pied one of the
first formes in an outburst of Savonarolish
i n d i g nation—
little did those
unprescient folk
realise that the
institution they
condemned was
destined to be-
come the endur-
ing home and
repository of all
the religious
tracts and
treatises and
all the hymnals
and psalters
that the world
could produce.
Apparently the
first thing a
doctor of di-
“Send a copy to The
Bulletin.”
vinity thinks
of when he completes a hum-dinging
slashing assault on the Pelagian heresy or a
brilliantly erudite paraphrase of the hymns of
Dr. Watts is to send a copy to The Bulle-
tin and wait for its gasp of admiration. The
proper transport of these tomes was a matter
of deep concern to Mcßlazes, who at one
stage had a vague idea of chartering a fleet
of motor hearses. All this, however, •is
getting rather away from the point, which
is the spectacular features of the actual
moving day—the summation and apotheosis
of all the toil that Mcßlazes and his stern,
silent black assistants accomplished while
others slept.
It must be confessed that moving-day was
nearly a fiasco. For days before, Honey-
bubble, the office cat (he’s black and white,
of course), had been moody. He wandered
into people’s rooms meowing in an aggres-
sive manner, and I'efused to be comforted.
On the day he took up a Strategic positionl-
- the stairs, and when a man came down
carrying a lapis-lazuli bust of Phil May
in one hand and a hot-water can in the
other, he (Honeybubble) rushed between
his (the man’s) feet, so that Honeybubble
and the man and Pliil May and the hot-
watei* can all got dented. The man chased
Honeybubble as far as Mai’ket-street, where
both disappeared. The moving went relent-
lessly on. One by one, as chairs were
snatched from under them, typewriters and
linotypes wrested from their gtaSp and roll-
top desks dismantled by shock-troops of men
armed with screwdrivers, the members of
the staff drifted out into the street, and,
having nowhere else to go, followed their
erstwhile possessions to the new home —all
speckless in white plaster, shining enamel
and polished wood. There they promptly
got lost in a maze of floors, passages, lifts,
and stairs, all
except the
Showman,
who, having
provided him-
self with a
reel of cotton
tied one end
to the door-
handle of his
room and the
other to the
front door, and
thus made sure
his path.

pantechnicons, 143 motor-lorries, six traffic
cops and Mcßlazes’s 1899 model Rolls-
Royce participated, it may be said
that the new Bulletin office is unique
among the big newspaper offices in the world
in that it makes no attempt whatever to
conceal the means whereby it makes its
living. It can never be mistaken for a bank
or a movie palace or a cenotaph. The front
windows on George-street invite the public
to gaze upon the essential guts of the estab-
lishment —-the machine room —where, occupy-
ing pride of place on the ground floor
(it’s usual to hide ’em in a dark cellar),
stretches a vista of rotary presses, behind
which —somewhere up near Pitt-street —■
you can, if you have very good eyesight,
catch a glimpse of the stereo and composing
rooms. It was through this mechanical
atelier (occupied at the time by hot and
bothered men who, with the aid of cranes,
were reassembling some of the machines)
that Honeybubble made an impressive
entrance. He had thrown off pursuit;
returned to the old abode and found it
empty, swept and
garnished, and
followed the jani-
tor, who has been
known to buy
him fish and chips
when rats were
scarce, to the new
domicile. But the
new domicile al-
ready had a cat
■—a brindled mon-
ster nearly four
hands high, named
Nightmarch. As
Honeybubble, tail
held high, stalked
in like Alexander
sur v e ying his
most recently-
conquered city,
“They all got dented.”
Nightmarch emitted a bloodthirsty yell
and fell upon him. There then formed
in the centre of the machinery hall
a whirlwind, the nucleus of which was
black-and-white and hrindle. This swept
hither and thither all over the building, this
way and that, returning at last to its
starting point. Suddenly there was a heart-
rending screech and the nucleus resolved
itself into its original atoms. H'oneybubble
sat alone in the centre of the floor, exactly
on the spot where he had been assaulted.
Already a dot in the distance was Night-
march, bound apparently for Honolulu.
Thus peace came at the end of moving-day,
but the Showman’s cotton clue to the laby-
rinth was broken, and exactly where he is
in it he never expects to discover.

1 had no sooner entered this country of Aus-
tralia than I discovered that the barbarians
were in a state of open warfare one with
another. Citizens, expressing themselves in
terms of unimaginable ferocity, told me that
for two years they had suffered under what
they called a Fair Cow of a Depression. I
gathered that this Depression was of so
severe a nature that if our own beloved
province of Szechuan were afflicted with
seven earthquakes and a visit from the Re-
publican Treasurer, all in the one year, it
would suffer only a small portion of their
misery; that the Depression was due to cer-
tain bandits known as Po-Lee-tish-Huns;
that these Po-Lee-tish-Huns had split the
nation into warring camps known as Ly-yon-
ites, Scul-lin-ites and Lang-ites; that war to
the knife had been declared between them;
that the military situation was complicated
by the existence of certain guerilla bands
known as Co-Mun-ists, who are of a red com-
plexion ; and that a great battle was pend-
ing at a place called The Polls.

are world-famous for their martial prowess,
having not long since dispatched to Europe
an army larger than the army with which
Jcnghis Khan overran China, and that this
army fought with the courage of our legen-
dary heroes and the fury of 400,000 tigers;
and perceiving that for every monument to
their poets and philosophers they have
erected ten to their soldiers, I felt an imme-
diate impulse to return at once to the bar-
barian vessel that had brought me. At the
same time, however, I listened to promptings
of filial devotion, since I knew that you
would be professionally interested in the bar-
barian manner of conducting warfare —•
whether victorious generals ate the hearts
of their adversaries in order to acquire their
military virtues; what recipes they used
for conferring invulnerability on their sol-
diers, and for how long and by what methods
they tortured their prisoners. After several
hours of agonising indecision I decided to
refer the question to the gods by the method
universally followed in this country, known
as spinning a brown.
The gods had no sooner given their de-
cision than j read the following in one of
the barbarian newspapers :
PRE-SELECTION WAR.
A war over candidatures is threatened between
the United Country party and the United Australia
party. Meetings of the electorate councils of the
“War to the knife"
Country party to be held at once in Ballarat and
Bendigo to decide whether candidates shall not be
nominated for both seats are symptomatic. It is
stated by the chief president of the Country party
that if the Nationalists are out for trouble the
gloves will be off, and they will find it. The
Nationalists are not giving the Country party any
quarter in Indi and Wannon, and they must expect
retaliation. In the two divisions they are nominat-
ing candidates against the candidates endorsed some
time ago by the Country party. That cannot be
suffered quietly.
Concluding from this paragraph that the
worst carnage and the fiercest fighting would
be at Ballarat, I immediately proceeded to
that city. What was my astonishment on
arriving at the scene of operations to find
the citizens thronging their places of amuse-
ment, visiting the lake which is the pride of
the city for the purpose of washing, and
laughing on the pavements as if nothing were
about to happen. My state of confusion
must have, been apparent on my face, for I
was standing in the main street of the city,
ready to take shelter at the first outbreak of
hostilities, when a barbarian approached me
and asked me if I had lost my way. I
hastened to express my desire to survey, from
a position of reasonable security, the move-
ments of the various belligerents. The bar-

barian, who had all the appearance of a
gentleman of culture and refinement, looked
extremely puzzled, but, at length grasping
my meaning, pointed to a small hall opposite,
where, he said, the local offensive against
the enemy forces which were disrupting the
country would commence that evening at
8 p.m. Knowing the difficulties you yourself
have experienced in manoeuvring large armies
even on the wide plains of Szechuan, I mar-
velled that the Australians should fight their

terference. Revered begetter! Let the reputa*
tion of thy despicable offspring for veracity
remain untarnished despite the most damn-
ing evidence to the contrary! I have read
in the barbarian annals of the Amazons who
removed their left breasts in order the better
to stretch their bowstrings; of the beauti-
ful Boadicea who repelled the Roman
legions in Britain; of the heroic .Toan of
Arc who led the armies of a French king
with conspicuous courage; of the Black
Virgin of the Crimean War; and of the
famous Botchkareva and her battalion of
death who pledged themselves to shoot the
enemy instead of embracing him when the
Bolsheviks sought to make peace with the
Germans. I am also aware that our own
Taipihg king had a regiment of skirted war-
riors who preferred the arms of war to
those of their husbands. Nevertheless, my
amazement was unbounded when I perceived
that the field of battle was completely occu-
pied by women; that more women, evidently
officers, sat on a platform at one end and
that the sole equipment of the various armies,
which appeared to be inextricably mixed, con-
sisted of a glass, a bottle of water and not
more than 20 umbrellas. Nor did my amaze-
ment lessen when, as the evening wore on,
I learnt that it was not intended to use the
umbrellas in the ensuing conflict but that
the only weapon that the combatants pro-
posed to employ was the tongue.
This organ, which with us is despised
except for its function as a medium of taste,
is, I learnt to my surprise, highly prized by
the barbarians for its inferior function of
speech. It is even more highly valued than
the brain, with which it seems to have no
discernible connection. The / possession of
a tongue is regarded as the most valuable
attribute of a politician, the youth and inex-
perience of the owner being a secondary con-
sideration. Tongues are of many kinds —
biting tongues, persuasive tongues and lying
tongues—and the possessor of all or any of
the varieties has a wide range of professions
open to him, such as trades-union organiser,
delegate to the League of Nations, member of
the Commonwealth Bank Board and even
Prime Minister. Such is the veneration felt
by all barbarians for the tongue that a person
whose practice of agriculture is confined to
the occasional use of a lawn-mower may
become a farmers’ candidate for their Parlia-
mentary institutions solely because of the
size and activity of his organ of articulation.
The male barbarians, despite their reputa-
tion for deeds gained on the battlefields of
France, are as contented to use this weapon
of the tongue as are the women. In fact,
w 7 hen they defeat their enemies, they do not
dismember them or remove their heads, but
share in their victims’ punishment by per-
mitting them to enter their H'ouses of Par-
liament, where victors and vanquished talk
to each other for the succeeding three years.

plement or missile known as a Vote.
Despite the most painstaking research I have
been unable to discover whether the Vote,
which it is the curious custom of the Govern-
ment to supply gratis to every adult in the
land, contains explosive material, poison gas
or bacterial germs, though I have learned
that its effect on the defeated army is often
political extinction, obliging large numbers
of them to go and get work. Ali I can dis-
cover is that it is not thrown, at or thrust
into the enemy, but is dropped into a box at
a time and in a place agreed _on by all _ the
belligerents. In view of this uncertainty
and remembering our proverb, a live dog is
better than a dead lion, on the day of the
battle of General Election your degenerate
offspring will stay in bed.
The only new thing the professional stage
offers Sydney this week is the revue “The
Whirl of the World,” at the Roxy, mainstays
of which are Hector St. Clair, Nellie Kolle,
Bert Ray, Elroy, and six kids who form
a jazz band. Also there’s a ballet. The
Repertory Society on Saturday had another
Grand (iuignol orgy —five one-acters, rang-
ing from horrible tragedy to wild farce.
Some of the acting was brilliant, and there
were no dull moments.
Isidor Goodman, at Sydney Con. Hall,
made the “Waldstein” chief offering of a
piano recital. The pianist gave intelligent
expression to the adagio and gambolled hap-
pily through the rondo. A perfect perform-
ance of the “Waldstein” is something heard
only in dreams, but Mr. Goodman’s reading
pleased this Showman better than that of
some of the itinerant players—Levitzky’s for
one. “The Messiah” was performed at the
Lvceum on Sunday by a combination of
choirs, V. W. Peterson conducting. The
ensemble effects might have been just a
little crisper, but the spirit of the oratorio
was there. At the Con. Hall on Saturday,
Roland Foster’s Rainbow Choir (Sopranos
and contraltos) went through a long and
very varied programme, most ambitioils item
being a scene from Gounod’s “Queen of
Sheba,” completely staged. The choir, which
started off well, shows steady improvement.
H- H- *
At Melbourne Royal a revival of Somer-
ville’s “Maid of the Mountains” holds the
stage with the bounteous Gladys Moncrieff
as the Maid. La Moncrieff doesn’t bother
about acting at all nowadays. She just
walks about and lets the voice flow out of
her, and it flows out with less effort than
ever and is specked with even more love-
liness. Frank Leighton’s BaldaSarre is a
conventional answer to the flapper’s prayer,
and Stigant is—Stigant. which is high
praise. Sydney Burchall lends charm to
everything he sings. “Lean Harvest,” Gregan
McMahon’s latest production at Melb. King’s,
holds a chiding finger up to Mammon in
the whimsy Barrie way. The worst fault
was the inability of some of the actors
to convey a convincing illusion of the man-
ners of a particular English set, a defect
which Eileen Watt, Julie Cotton and Aubrey
Gibson did most to eradicate.
George Henry, a 10-year-old violinist
whom Fritz Hart trained, played some
Beethoven and other items very nicely at an
Assembly Hall concert in Melbourne on a
recent night.

The collapse of prices, including those in the
wheat, produce, hides, skins and metal
markets, has not only directly affected the
co.’s commission and other earnings, but has
also impaired the ability of many clients to
repay their advances. So, after shearing
off something for contingencies, gross profits
were figured" to be £125,327 lighter than the
previous year’s:—
1920. 1926. 1930. 1931.

Total outgo. £664,721 £656,600 £691,276 £741,154
The spring in salaries, etc., was due to the
cost of exchange (£67,729) ; the savings in
taxes was ou account of English assessments.
Thus, allowing for the pref. div., but includ-
ing £25,000 sent to the staff fund (this is
deducted before writing profits into the in-
troductory table, which records the bare
amounts remaining for shareholders), there
was enough to visibly show but 2.3 p.c. on
the £1,500,000 of ord. capital as against 14,
26.5, 21.7, 25.7 aud 27 p.c. back to 1926.
Still, 7 p.c. was distributed, though, after
£67,729 of inner reserAes had been unearthed
and consumed, the visible lay-by bad to be
tapped for £26,530 to do it.
.[.Nevertheless, encouraged by the rise in
prices and a bright seasonal outlook, the
board lifted the final div. to S p.c. p.a. The
market, further encouraged by election pros-
pects aud the history of the business, counts
on the co. doing better, and prices
the _ £2O shares paid to £5 at £lO as
against £7 15s. three months ago. The
return at £lO is 4 p.c. ou an 8 p.c. div. basis,
or 5 p.c. should the div, be lifted to 10 p.c.
To pay the debenture interest, pref. div. and
10 p.c. to the ords., total funds (capital,
reserves and debentures combined) need turn
in only 4.5 p.a net.
The way in which the co. has come to the
assistance of clients during a difficult time,
and the solid nature of the financial struc-
ture, are seen in the next comparison of

of the floating debt at June 30. Investments,
unchanged at £1,000,000, consist chiefly of
gilt-edge securities ; they appeared at or below
market value wheu the books were ruled off.
Debtors’ balances are the key of the position ;
and the outlook in this respect has bright-
ened considerably since Britain went “off”

Fierce competition and heavy Government
imposts had made the co.’s American busi-
ness very expensive to handle; also an
inevitable contraction of premium income
threatened to make it unprofitable. Hence
the board decided to quit the field; and the
New York and Montreal offices, set up in
1924 and 1925 respectively, were closed.
Besides costing £75.000 for reinsurance, this
meant jettisoning about £200,000 of premium
income. The co.’s London marine business,
which has been unsatisfactory for the last
decade, was curtailed, and the fall in values,
lighter stocks carried by merchants, shrunken
pay-rolls and the slump in motor-car busi-
ness caused the evaporation of a lot of
insurable value, too. Further, disturbed con-
ditions in India and China, and the fall in
the price of silver affected returns from
the co.’s business in those quarters.
Altogether the slip in the year’s net pre-
miums was £258,163.

Exes, made off with an extra £2 6s. of each
£lOO of net premiums. But the loss rate
was the best since 1926; the underwriting
surplus was £3077 compared with a loss of
£17,284 and surpluses of £26,924 and £51,148
for the three preceding terms. That was
after charging the cost of reinsuring the
American business against reserves.
However, shareholders can still see accumu-
lations £154,190 in excess of the round half-
million of paid capital, of which £425,000 was
provided out of surplus earnings during the
nine years to 1920. The lot is invested
mainly in Government and public-body securi-
ties in Australia, Maoriland, India, Canada
and U.S.A. Moreover, last year’s interest,
rents, etc., turned in £72,390, equal to 14.4
p.c. on capital. Of course, returns from
the co.’s Australian securities will be affected
by the national debt conversion, etc. Still,
when conditions become more settled, pros-
pects of a restoration of the 24 p.e. bonus
(it bad been an annual event for "the 16 years
to the close of accounts in 1929), or perhaps
the scattering of other sweets, are as bright
as anything of the kind can be in these
troubled times.
Policy-holders have no cause to stay aivake
o’ nights. When the books closed net tan-
gibles were equal to 223 p.c. of the year’s
net premiums, which is 73 p.c. more than
usually considered adequate. Funds were in
this form:—

The market lengthened its bids for the

at last week-end. The return at 435. 6d.

Last year the flow of bonuses to policy-
holders and divs. to shareholders was
interrupted by a smaller volume of busi-
ness, lighter interest earnings, extra Gov-
ernment bleeding and the need for fur-
ther repairs to the financial structure. For
the three years to the close of accounts in
1930 bonuses to policy-holders aggregating
£185,602 were allotted and £255,942 of sur-
plus takings was used to wipe out a like
amount of old establishment charges, while
shareholders received only £34,47S in divs.
averaging 3.3 p.c. Thus the interests of
policy-holders have been placed in the fore-
ground, and the business has been put on
a sound basis. Future benefits will depend
partly upon further reduction of costs,
partly upon the course of taxation and. partly
upon the support which policy-holders con-
tinue to give; they will gain more by main-
taining their contracts than by allowing them
to lapse.
The year’s incomings exceeded outgoings
by £134,070 —Ordinary branch, £124,395;
Accident. £9675 —which was £120,017 short
of the 1930 figure. The net growth in
liabilities under policies was £47,051, leav-
ing a divisible surplus of £88,400. Of this
£15,000 was reserved for bonuses to policy-
holders, £58,000 was struck off the estab-
lishment account, reducing it to £55.000 (it
stood at £368,942 at Jan. 1, 1926), and
£12,623 was used to rub out more of the
old bad debts.
The recriminations associated with the
change in control five years ago resulted in a
heavy falling off in new business. But this
may not do the co. any harm in the long
run; large savings have been made in costs,
which were formerly a hindrance to the
development of satisfactory earning capac-
ity. Consider these figures:—
1926. 1929. 1930. 1931.

Thus, there was a slip of £128.111 in the
amount of new business put on the books
last year. Excluding taxation, exes, got
away with 23.7 p.c. of the net premiums
as against 25 p.c. in the previous term and
40.1 p.c. in 1926. But owing to heavier
lapses—£64,667 was paid in surrenders as
against £33,918 in 1930 —the year’s first
premiums cost 169 p.c. compared with
164 p.c. and 189 p.c. in 1930 and 1929 re-
spectively; that is assuming that new busi-
ness is 10 times more expensive than old.
The next table shows how 7 the protection
for policy-holders and shareholders has been
strengthened during the last five years:—

‘■lncludes reserves for unexpired risks—
£l2,l7B, 1926 ; £13,367, 1930; £11,985, 1931.
Thus net tangibles exceeded liabilities under
policies, plus reserves for unexpired accident
risks, by £368,593 at Sept. 30, an improve-
ment of £297,338 since 1926. The backing
for the 10s. shares has thus advanced from
2s. Id. to 10s. 4d. over the same period.
The outstanding feature last year was a
growth of £49,225 in loans on policies; the
weakness there lies in the possibility of
borrowers allowing their policies to lapse.
The office assumes that its life fund Avill
earn 4 p.c.; last year’s return from invest-
ments was 3.8 p.c. on mean funds as against
5.6 p.c. in 1930. The board is considering
the question of lowering the basis of valua-
tion to offset the effect of interest-reduction
legislation, etc.
The scrip is priced at 3s. 6d. on the
morket, at which figure the return w ould be
6 p.c. on a 2 p.c. div. basis.

It w 7 as the success of “Minties” that
enabled the ords. to get a long-delayed taste
in 1925. Previously the business bad not
been robust; hence the high div. rate at
AVhieli the pref. capital was put out during
1920-23. One of the conditions on which
this 10 p.c. money was raised was that at
no time should the pref. capital exceed
£lOO,OOO. Stedmans started manufacturing
sweets in the ’fifties or thereabouts; Hender-
sons linked up much later. In 1920 the co.
was reconstructed, and ord. capital became
£530,630. Just prior to the war combined
capital of the two separate concerns was
about a tenth of that figure; in between
the small business of Dillon, Burroughs and
Co. had been bought.
Nestles became interested during the 1920
reconstruction. This ensured a much wider
distribution for Stedman-Hendersqn’s pro-
ducts, and by 1925, and with the help of
“Minties” and other new lines, the business
began to make a steady recovery. In addi-
tion to the profits shown in the table, large
sums have been added each year to specific
reserves (now £156,227). There is £34,170
in general reserve, but that item is labelled
nominal in the table because it is subject to
£48,250 of patent rights.
Confectionery is a luxury easily dispensed
with, and over the past two years this cov’s
net earnings have dropped precipitously. In
1930 they were halved, and in the past term,
after taking stock at £33,333 lower, they
were halved again, the final figure being
£3Oll in excess of pref. div. requirements.
There is nothing uneasy about the
finances:—

Plant attracts attention; turnover needs to
be brisk if that item is to earn its keep.
Of course, the figure is offset by the specific
reserves above mentioned, and they may not
be the only allowances for depreciation.
Investments dropped from £158,620 in
1925 to £71,289 in 1926: that followed
the sale of a subsidiary’s business to Life
Havers (Australasia), Ltd., for £75,000
in cash and £29,060 in ords. The latter
co. has not made a very impressive show-
ing, and in 1930 there was a further drop
of £40,574 in Stedman-Henderson’s in-
vestment account. That year specific reserves
Avere tapped for a large amount, which may
have been written off investments. Last term
£25,180 was spent in establishing a branch
in Maoriland. One way and another the,
more or less liquid surplus, including stocks,
was £11,367 lower at £78,832. Debtors,
down £55,820 since 1929, roughly indicate
the Avay in which turnover has slipped.
The public is interested onlv in the prefs.
The firsts are covered by £l3 6s. in net tan-
gibles; the seconds by £1 less. At par both
lots return 72 p.c. after allowing for the
statutory div. cut.
Great Western Portland Cement
Sydney co. Avas registered as far back
as 1924 as Clandulla Cement, Ltd., but in 1926
the name was changed to the present title.
Ihc original intention was to erect cement
works at Clandulla, near Kandos, on the
rs. 8. Wales western railway line. The public
Avas asked to put up a quarter million of
for the purpose, and the vendor took
£45,000 in paids and £5OOO cash for shale,
coal and limestone deposits held under mining
leases. The response was good enough to
warrant the board pushing on with the ven-
ture ; but estimates went all awry from the
jump, and the co. has not yet reached the
production stage. Indeed, it has not yet
erected the cement-producing plant, and
unless it is able to raise more money some-
where it is doubtful whether it will ever
become a competitor in the already heavily-
overcapitalised industry.
At the close of accounts in 1930 paid capi-
tal had reached £200,242 in 232,968 shares
of £1 each. Preliminary exes, and other
payments charged to establishment had made
off with £48,287; there was £22,016 in the
bank, and mining leases and mining equip-
ment, including a tramway, sidings, etc.,
accounted for most of the balance, as the fol-
lowing table show’s: —
1927. 1930. 1931.
Paid capital .. .. £151,998 £ 200,242 £194,753
Debentures .. .. 7,700

Book debts, etc. .. 6,547 943 1,473
Cash .. .. .. 29,315 22,016 '2,928
Meanwhile the board changed its mind about
the site of the manufacturing plant. This is
now to be put up at Bunnerong, Sydney,
where land has been leased. Also, it has been
decided to turn out cement by a patent pro-
cess, the rights, etc., to which w’ere bought
for £66,000 during the last term.
This deal was mainly responsible for the
year’s spring in the debt and for depletion of
the cash holding. Cash was draw r n upon for
£19,088; a further £7700 was raised on
debentures, and the amount coming to sundry
creditors increased by £49,270, which in-
cludes £45,000 to be handed to the vendor
in fully-paids. There was a reduction of
£18,550 in the issued capital (£214,418 at
June 30), and of £5489 in paid capital, which
may have been the result of the removal of
names from the register. The book value
of fixed assets decreased by £l2Ol. Obvi-
ously most of the money that went out
during the year was passed to the vendor in
part-payment for rights, the worth of which
to the co., in the absence of necessary plant,
is what they will fetch; and it may be diffi-
cult to find another willing buyer.
Leaving the £45,000. of scrip coming to the
vendor out of the reckoning, liabilities ex-
ceeded liquids by £7843 when the books
last closed compared with a liquid surplus
of £22,959 at the previous balance. Of the
£194,753 of paid capital £119,527 w T as repre-
sented by intangibles; thus shareholders
could see net tangibles with a book value of
but Bs. lOd. for every pound they had put up.
Even should the co. be able to raise enough
money to erect a cement plant, its prospects
are not encouraging.

It is the story of the old delusion of writing
up paid capital to represent “the x’eal value
of the assets.” A reconstruction in 1919 made
the S p.c. div. in the following term worth
almost double that to old holders. The
boom continued, and in. 1924 there was
another reconstruction. This time goodwill
w r as given a value of £180,324, and together
with most of the tangible assets was passed
over to a subsidiary for £270,000 in scrip.
Thus the parent w 7 as able to scatter five
new shares for every tw r o old ones, raising
paid capital to £300,540; it has since
advanced to £348,558 by par issues.
Meanwhile the market broke, competition
sharpened, the parent’s cash resources had
been drained to finance capital expenditure
by the subsidiary, whose plant capacity had
been extended beyond the requirements of
the Commonwealth and Maoriland combined.
Thus it became impossible to make a satis-
factory showing on the inflated capital; so
this co., Victor Electric Plaster and Penin-
sular Plaster decided to go on the market
together. They sold their fixed assets and
stocks to a new operating concern, Austra-
lian Gypsum Products Pty., as from July 1.
1930.
Australian Gypsum, Ltd., received £200,000
of scrip in the new co. This replaced shares
in and advances to subsidiaries, w’hich stood
in the books at £384,691 at June 30, 1930.
and some of the co.’s own plant, etc. On
paper the loss on the deal was £191.174;
actually the hot air pumped into the assets
in 1924 w r as squeezed out. At June 30 last
the co.’s only other assets Avere freeholds,
etc., £llOO, and book debts, etc.. £3155. There
Avas £5772 coming to sundry creditors, and
£3887 to debenture-holders. Shareholders
could thus see net assets Avith a book value
of £194.596 (11s. 2d. per share) to support
£348,55S of capital. In the circumstances
it would be sound practice to write off the
difference, and perhaps a bit more for good
measure. The market speculates in the
scrip at Is. 3d.
Owing to the dulness in the building trade
the operating co. had only three factories at
work last year, and trading resulted in a
small loss. Locally the co.’s prospects are
far from bright; the board is therefore im-es-
tigating market possibilities in Maoriland
and Asia. Much will depend upon its success
or otherwise in this respect.

Your Children’s Education
—for Mothers to Read
HERE is a story for mothers to read. It is a story of two boys,
Jim and Jack, each worshipped by his parents, who, though
of small means, intended their boys to be doctors.
Both boys passed their exams, splendidly, and went up to the
University together, Jim winning prizes that suggested that he had a
brilliant career ahead of him. Within a month Jim’s father was
dead, and his little family faced poverty. Jim had to leave the
University at once to seek a living. That was the end of his chances.
Within another month Jack’s father was dead, too —a strange
coincidence, yes, but only in part. When Jack was three years old
his father had taken out

a 15 years’ A.M.P.
Endowment Policy for
£2OO, and, though
Jack was only 17, a
sum of £250 was avail-
able immediately. That
was last year. The lad
will not have any
money for luxuries, but
he has not lost his
chance of a career. By
careful husbanding of
his capital, and some
help from his sisters,
he will win out!
Through the A.M.P. you can guarantee
that the money will be available for it
There is hardly a man in the land but could afford to take out a short-
term Endowment Policy for his boy. The cost is very small. The
father is the person assured, so that, in the event of his death before
the policy matures, the sum assured (plus bonuses) becomes available
immediately.
A man 27 years of age, in good health, with a boy three (3) years
old, can take out an A.M.P. Table J Policy for £2OO, payable when
the boy is 18 years. The premium would be £l2/14/2 a year—a
little over a pound a month.
If the boy (or girl) does not elect to go to the University, what a nice
little nest-egg is £250 with which to start life!
Mothers with young children should talk this splendid policy over
with their husbands. The use of the coupon at foot will bring them
full information.

averaged 14.5 p.c. for the five years to the
close of accounts in 1925. Then, to meet in-
creasing competition from overseas manufac-
turers, it was decided to link up w’ith nine
others in the trade, and one big operating
co., Uuited Felt Hats Pty., was formed. The
amount of goodwill involved in the merger
was not disclosed. The Denton Co. received
£157,775 in fully paids for its plant, stocks,
etc. These shares it took into its own sheet
at £66,397 (=Bs. sd. each), and visible
reserves benefited by £23,017.
But the hew operating co. lias been unable
to hold business. Thus, despite the elimina-
tion of much duplication and overhead,
results have been disappointing, and no divs.
have been paid. The curtain is kept drawn
over its figures, but a loss of £17,569 w’as
reported for the 12 months to June 30 last.
That w’as due partly to further contraction
of turnover, and largely to the fall of prices,
including the price of furred skins. Indeed,
stocks, which w’ere taken into account at
cost, are said to be at least £30,000 in excess
of current market values. Other assets are
also admitted to be much overvalued in the
books, and a general reconstruction, involv-
ing loss of capital, is under consideration.
This is not expected to affect the figure
at which the Denton co.’s holding appears in
its own sheet. This co.’s other assets, returns
from which w’ere £lOO9 short of the amount
required to pay divs. averaging 4.7 p.c. over
the last five years, consist chiefly of free-
hold (leased to the operating co.). mortgages
and Commonwealth bonds. Here is the
position as the published figures show it: —
1928. 1929. 1930. 1931.
Paid capital .. £86,420 £86,420 £86,420 £86,420

ties, etc. . . 40,232 23,391 19,978 22,811
Last year mortgages (now’ £11,000) W’ere
reduced by £6OOO, and £2833 was added to
the cash holding (£3299) and £3729 to the
book value of freeholds.
The market prices the pound shares, w’hicli
have a net asset backing of 30s. sd., around
13s. The return at 13s. is 3.8 p.c. on a 21
p.c. div. basis, or 7.7 p.c. on double that
rate of div. Everything depends upon the
ability of the operating co. to develop profit-
earning capacity. Savings of over £36,000
p.a. are expected from a recent overhaul of
the organisation, including the closing down
of the Sydney factory and the transfer of
most of the remaining operations from the
Fairfield to the Denton mills. The Sydney
business made losses aggregating £20,000 for
the five years to June 30, 1930. For the 12
months to that date the co.’s Victorian
mills netted £14,500.
Indooroopilly Toll Bridge, Ltd.
This co. is being formed to build a sus-
pension bridge across the Brisbane River at
Indooroopilly, displacing the punt there,
and facilitating communication with residen-
tial areas on the right bank and with towns
west to Ipswich and beyond. Nominal is
£75,000 in £lO shares, of which 6000 are
offered. Walter Taylor, promoter, designer
and contractor, takes £4500 in paids for his
title to the franchise and for plans and
specifications. The contract price for the
bridge, which w’ill have a span of 600 ft., is
£58,500, including £3500 in scrip. In
ordinary circumstances, the prospectus says,
the cost w’ould be £82,000; but the 24 cables
from which the deck is to be suspended are
under offer to the promoter for a few thou-
sand pounds, apparently from Dorman, Dong.
Toll and other takings for the first five
years are figured at £38,955, based on ferry
returns and traffic on the main Toowoomba
road. Exes., including directors’ fees, taxa-
tion and maintenance, are expected to make
off w’ith £13,583, leaving £25,375 net, or
enough to pay divs. advancing from 5J p.c.
for the first to 10 p.c. in the fifth year
on £65,000. The franchise, granted by
Order in Council in November last, is for
such time as will enable the co. to recoup
its capital outlay together with divs. aver-
aging 10 p.c. p.a., but shall not exceed
35 years. The compensation clauses are
liberal, the prospectus says; but the
sophisticated investor will want to know
something more definite than that. Also the
co.’s revenue will partly depend upon
whether the track via the new bridge will
be good enough to divert traffic from the
present main road to Ipswich, etc. The
directors may go to allotment when 400
shares have been subscribed; and in three
cases out of four, cos. with insufficient
capital have a lingering death.
New Guinea Goldfields expects to have its
pow’er plant in operation early in the new
year. This will hasten the opening up at
depth of extensive deposirs on the upper
or plateau area, where work has been ham-
pered because the power available has not
been sufficient to drive large pumps. The
100-ton-per-day mill on the lower area will
be connected by aerial tramway with the
plateau as soon as sufficient tonnage is proved.

been trdeed for half a mile, and with a
couple of shafts to, say, 50ft., the proposi-
tion would be in good shape for sampling.

Since the beginning of 1931 Westralian
gold producers have received nearly £700,000
in exchange premiums. British capital,
which held back for a time, is coming for-

Herman Mandelstam for the development
of Tindals (Coolgardie), Big Bell (Cue)
and the Edjudina goldmines (Yerilla). Bore-

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) What advantage would xce derive from
stabilising the £ at 130? Would it then be
worth more in sterling or dollars than at
present? (2) If a depreciated currency
gives advantage to an exporting country, why
has Britain, with a pound worth 75 p.c. of
its original value, an advantage over France
with a franc worth only 20 p.c. of its par
value? —7357. . . ....
(1) If our £ w’ere stablised at 130 to 100
on a gold basis, it would be worth 15s. 4d.
in gold. At present it is worth 11s. 2d.
Internal debts w’ould be discharged by pay-
ment of the devalued pound; but to pay an
outside debt of a given amount we w’ould
have to pay more pounds—l3o instead of
100. (2) A devalued currency gives only a
temporai’y advantage to an exporting coun-
try ; the advantage disappears as soon as
costs, etc., have adjusted themselves to the
new’ standard. In France wages and other
costs have adjusted themselves. The franc

it is worth 100 p.c. of its new par value,

milkmen are after one customer, the milk-

But presently the buyer finds out and he

(1) How does the brown coal in Australia
compare with that in other countries in

(2) Has much developmental work been done
on Australian brown coal deposits apart from
Morwell (Vic.)? (3) Has any attempt been
made to briquette our brown coals? —7lo4.
(1) Brown coal in Australia has not been
extensively developed on account of abundant
supplies of cheap fuel and the deposits being
removed from industrial centres. The State
Electricity Commission of Yic. is now’ work-
ing a brown coal seam averaging 150 ft. thick
over an area of 10 sq. miles with 30ft. of
overburden. Other countries use brown coal
as fuel (raw’ or briquetted) and for dis-
tillation and by-products. The Vic. deposits
are not on the average of sufficiently high
value for distillation, but for fuel, briquet-
ting and pulverised fuel they are proving
satisfactory. (2) Other brown-coal opera-
tions in Vic.; Dal Dal. shafts to 200 ft. and
drives (1861-1925) ; Altona, shaft to 400 ft.
(1897 and 1928) ; Bambra, open cut (1925) ;
Morwell, open cut (1891-93 and 1916). (3)
Brown coal has been used in pulverised form
by Vic. State Electricity Commission. Briqu-
ettes are made from crushed coal, and the
Commission, from its plant at Yallourn, is
turning out 1000 tons per day; these arc
sold for industrial and household purposes.

BRIEF ANSWERS.
A.J.W.: One of the half-dozen best.
Though you may live to be 65, there are many who
won’t. Life assurance gives you an estate at once

is always liable to land the borrower in trouble.
There is no certainty that the market will continue

THE INTERLOPER
By VANCE
PALMER
ALL morning as Duggan had ploughed
through the loose sand, loading his
bags of shell-grit, the one thought had
washed about in his mind like a lump of
seaweed in a tidal pool. It had been with him
the night before, lying awake beside Mag
in the shingled house that overlooked the
strip of broken beach; but though he badly
wanted to know what she felt about it, he
had kept his mouth shut. There were some
things he could never talk over with Mag,
and Charlie was one of them. He felt that
any mention of the fellow would touch a
nerve in her that too near the surface.
And he didn’t know Mag, not really; there
were corners of her mind that were still
hidden in a warm darkness. You lived with
a woman, sharing bed and board, and laugh-
ing at the same little jokes, but her inner
thoughts and feelings ran on tracks you
couldn’t follow!
This was an issue they couldn’t burke,
though. Charlie was out: he might be back
at the Bay any day now. The Doherty boys
had flung him the news as they came plugging
along from the mill in the township with a
load of timber, and even old Goyt, waddling
across the road from the store to the light-
house, had stopped to say:
“Charlie’s back, eh? Hanging around the
pub in the township, they tell me, and pitch-
ing a great tale to anyone who’ll buy him a
drink. You won’t want to let him lob down
on you here, H'arry, or you’ll never get rid
of him till the cows come home. Never be
nc> good, that fellow, to himself or anyone
else.”
Everyone was of one mind about that.
Charlie had an ugly twist in the grain of him,
and was born to give trouble to himself and
those around him; yet Duggan, moving his
pair of horses from one heap of full bags
to another, knew that the whole settlement
was watching with a hawk-eyed curiosity for
his return. It was an incident, a stone flung
into the still pool of their days. Up at
the pub they would be talking about Charlie,
telling yarns of the cranky things he had
done ever since he was a youngster, and
wondering if the three years behind brick
walls would have tamed him or turned him
still more sour. And they would be specu-
lating on how flis mother would receive him.
“Poor Mag! Always been a handful for
her, that fellow has. Got a kink in him that
nothing’ll ever straighten out. That’s the
worst of youngsters born on the wrong side
of the blanket. Seem to come into the world
with a grudge they’ve got to work on.”
Things unheard, except by his inner car,
flowed in upon Duggan as he worked, sharp-
ening his sense of revolt. Funny the pleasure
people got out of seeing others in a fix!
None of them wanted Charlie back at the
Bay ; man or woman, they hadn’t a good word
for him. But any resentment they felt at liis
return would be damped-down by their
curiosity about the way he himself would
take it. Charlie was his load of trouble —
not theirs! Even old Goyt, warning him
against letting Charlie lob down on him,
had had little devils of malicious humor
dancing in his eyes.
“Oughtn't to have tied yourself up with
a woman at your age, Harry,” he had seemed
to be saying. “You see where it lands you?”
But what other people thought didn’t matter
really. Deep down Duggan didn’t care about
anything but the way it affected Mag. He
suspected that she thought more about
Charlie than she showed, dreamed about him
secretly, even when she was wide awake,
moving down the hillside to milk the cows or
standing still among the bananas looking
down at the sea. A cloud of darkness
always gathered in him when he saw that
brooding look on her face. It made him
aware that they were separate, two beings
instead of one. A strange, exasperating thing,
this separateness! It showed itself in little
ways and sometimes made Duggan feel that
Mag was not really his wife, in spite of the
three years they had lived together. The
night before he had wanted to say definitely:
“Look _ here, Mag; now Charlie’s coming
out, you’ve got to choose between the two
of us. The place isn’t big enough for him
and me. If you’re going to take him under
your wing again, I’ll have to get out. Move
back to the old place up the beach.”
But every time he tried to speak, the words
stuck in his throat like a thread of fishbone.
He wasn’t sure what she would answer:
that was the real trouble. There was a core
of pride about Mag; she had lived too long
alone to feel dependent on any man, and
might get her back up if she felt he was
laying down the law. Charlie was her own
flesh and blood ; he, Duggan, was only the man
who had married her. Duggan had lain
awake beside her, looking at the darkened
roof and listening to the sea on the shingle.
No good meeting trouble half-way, he had
told himself. Perhaps Charlie would hear
how the land lay and sheer off!
He threw the last bag of shell-grit on
the waggon and sprang up, the two horses
leaping to their collars before they felt the
whip, their noses almost in the sand as they
strained up the cliff. The mail had just
come in at the store on the hill; Duggan
could see the people gathered round the dusty
car as he threaded the tea-tree on the track
below. And the boat had tied up at the jetty
and was beginning to unload. Already a
pile of stores and cases stood higher than
his own dump of shell-grit.
“Hello. Harry,” some of the fishermen
greeted him as he clattered up with his load.
“You’ll have an off-sidcr to help you now.
Charlie’s home.”
“Eh?”
“Charlie’s back. Seen him getting off the
mail-car at the store. Got a good suit of
clothes on his back, too: y’d think he’d just
been off to town for a fortnight’s holiday by
the look of him. Haven’t got a fatted calf
ready for him, have you, Harry?”
They
waddled
about the
jetty in their
bare feet and
rolled - up
pants, lend-
ing a hand
with the un-
loading, but
chuckling in-
wardly with
jokes that
had already
been cracked
about
Charlie’s re-
turn. There
was no one they liked better than Harry Dug-
gan, but it tickled them to think of him play-
ing the father to a crooked young brute like
Charlie. Such a queer sort of pride Duggan
had always had in his straightness, keeping to
himself, putting by his bit of money, paying
his store bill on the knocker, even when he
was hard-pressed to keep his horses fed. A
dark little self-contained man, burnt black
by long days on the beach, but white at the
core! They had all been knocked over when
he had gone to live with the Jarvie woman
after her son was sent down, for they didn’t
look a pair to run in double-harness. Both
had kept to themselves in the fifteen years
they had been at the Bay.
Duggan’s home lay on the cleared ridge
that overlooked the Bay, half a mile away
from the settlement. A shingle-roofed house
with a patch of bananas in front, straggling
down the slope, and a small paddock in the
rear that had been sown with buffalo grass.
It was Mag’s home, really: she had made a
THE GOOD OIL.
“This knife is quite blunt and the steak is like leather!”
“Yessir; sorry, sir. Did you try stropping the knife on the steak, sir?”
living out of it, selling milk, rearing fowls,
growing a few vegetables, in the years before
Duggan had married her; and a knowledge
of this was in the forefront of his mind as
he took the harness off the horses and backed
the trap into its shed. How could he kick
up a row about Charlie coming back? The
marks of the fellow’s tomahawk were in
every fence-post; the tin roof of the out-
house was punctured by bullets from his
rifle; it had been his home since he was a
youngster. Yet in Duggan’s brain the cloud
of darkness swelled, ready to burst.
“Charlie’s home,” was all Mag said, as
she brushed a strand of dark hair from her
forehead and bent over the stove.
She was flushed, and the patches of red
on her cheekbones deepened the darkness of
her eyes. Coal-dark they were in the shadowy
kitchen with its glaring stove. The subdued
excitement working in her blood seemed to
make her dumb, and she kept her back to
Duggan, moving from the stove to the dresser.
He stood for a few moments in silence,
not knowing what to say, and then shuffled
across the landing to the sitting-room whore
Charlie was lying on the lounge in his socks,
fiddling with the spring of the broken gramo
phone.
“Hello! Still beachcombing?” said Charlie
with a grin.
He had broadened and toughened, but
that was the only change in him. His round
bullet-head was jambed down tight on his
shoulders, so that he looked to have no neck.
Duggan met his eyes, which were good-
humored enough, but somehow evil, lacking in
any sense of humanity. They hinted at the
potential cruelty which had shocked even the
fishermen
when they
came across
it. And
Duggan him-
self had seen
him laughing
at. t li e
struggles of
a fowl that
had been run
over by a car.
It was some-
thing to
rouse a
horror in the
blood.
Any awk-
wardness between the two men was smoothed
over by Mag coming in with the steaming
leg of mutton, but the duel of their eyes
went on across the Table.
‘‘Dug in here, have you?” Charlie’s were
saying. “Well, I’m going to make myself
comfortable, too. You’ll go befoi-e I do.”
And Duggan’s were answering with a
dull passion: “Young thug! You’ve done
nothing but sponge on your mother since the
day you were born.”
The atmosphere of the house was smother-
ing to him since Charlie’s return, made it
hard for him to breathe freely. Already a
curtain had fallen between him and Mag;
he felt she had known in her very body that
Charlie was coming and yet had kept silent.
When the meal was over he took some hand-
lines and went down to fish for snapper from
the rocks on the headland, the brightness of
the sun-washed slopes and the lazy-smelling
sea increasing the darkness in his heart.
Children were looking for cowries in the
pools left by the outgoing tide; a group of
girls from the hills were racing their horses
along the hard sand ; on the green down by
the jetty the young fellows were playing
cricket.
Duggan, sitting on an outcrop of tide-
»washed rock, watched a sea-hawk in the
empty blue above, and thought of Charlie:
~ “It’s him or me for it. Something’d happen
it the two of us lived for long under the one
r00f... . Those damned ears of his standing
out from his head like a bat’s.”
It was partly physical the feeling that
Charlie roused in him, a hatred for his wit-
less grin and big lumbering body; but
the antagonism went deeper than that.
Charlie’s eyes—they weren’t good to remem-
ber. There was something brutal in the
laughing glint of them at one moment,, and
at another they were just blind and empty.
Duggan had a fear of the trouble the fellow
would inevitably bring to ftlag. There was
no telling what Charlie might do; it was
sheer luck that he wasn’t faced with a
charge of murder when he had smashed in
old Ramsay’s skull in the darkness of the
township store—an ugly business that still
roused talk and speculation. Mag believed
lie had been drinking with some other young
fellows and had broken into the store for a
joke, but the worst thing about Charlie w-as
that drink made him cold and clear in the
head. Tt was a devil old Ramsay had come
upon when he woke up in the night, not a
young fellow out for a lark. And there had
been other things at the Bay before that—the
lolling of the baker’s horse, the trouble about
the Clancy girl at the hotel, the burning of
Yorkie Payne’s boat. Charlie’s easy grin
was a screen that covered a hidden malice
against every one who thwarted or slighted
him. And though he was apparently casual
and indifferent to the results of what he
said or did, there was a cunning in him that
made him careful to cover up his tracks.
Altogether a lovely young cub for Mag
to have suckled! For the life of him
Duggan couldn’t understand why such a
fellow should have been born from her.
There wasn’t a man at the Bay who
didn’t respect Mag, and speak well of her.
They liked her sturdy independence, and the
way she looked everyone in the eyes, but there
was something more in it than that. All
of them felt, a warmth go through them as
she passed the time of day when she can-
tered by, the sun shining on her glossy lian-
as her body swung to the horse’s stride.
It was good to see her in the saddle, bare-
headed and short-skirted, rounding the cows
through the tea-tree or looking for patches
of grass where she could turn them out to
feed. But she was capable in the house,
too, and so clean in all her ways that people
were glad to take her milk and butter. Even
the women would have forgotten the cloud
that hung around Charlie’s birth if he had
been like other young fellows, -without that
something sinister about him, that hint of
the jungle in his eyes.
Yet it was his very crankiness that made
Mag particularly anxious to be good to him:
Duggan was quite sure of that. Deep down
in her was the feeling that anything he
lacked was her fault. It was secretly planted
in the core of her, something you couldn’t
argue about, though at one time she said
that Charlie had been kicked on the head by
a horse when he was six, and at another that
she. had dropped him on the floor when he
was a baby. Duggan brooded on the mater-
nal affection that flowed out of her as he
squatted on the rock with the slack line
between his fingers. It was as if invisible
fibres reached out from her body binding
her to Charlie. Currents of thought and
feeling passed from one to another. He him-
self had never any sense of contact like
that. They got along w T ell together, he and
Mag, but their life was a day-to-day affair.
He had never penetrated that inner world
that her mind seemed to sink down into
when she stopped talking, like a crab fading
back into the water weeds. They were
separate.
“What’s Charlie going to do here?” he
asked when they were getting ready for bed.
She stopped suddenly in taking down her
hair and seemed to stiffen ; perhaps it was
only the fear that their voices would be heard
through the thin partition.
“He’s talking about going back to Laverton
and looking for a job at the sawmills there.”
“When ?”
“I don’t know. He’ll take his own time.
.... You didn’t expect me to ask him ques-
tions like that, Harry, the first day he’s
come home?”
Duggan only said with a pretence of
casualness:
“There’s nothing doing here. Young Goyt
had to go away because there were so many
on the nets already. So did Yerney’s boy.
There’s two young fellows for every job that’s
. likely to be offering between now and Christ-
mas.” And then, some of the blackness well-
ing up in him, he added half under his
breath: “Charlie would stand a damn sight
better chance in a place where he wasn’t
known.”
They lay listening to the soft thunder of
the sea on the beach half a mile away. The
sound of it, penetrating the small, vine-
covered house on the slope, seemed to shut
the three of them in upon one another, cut-
ting them off from the rest of the world.
Duggan was terribly aware of Charlie lying
there on his bunk in the next room, a candle
on the chair beside him, his sleepy eyes
scanning a magazine. He could almost
the darkness spread when the light w T as
blown out.
In the mornings of the days that followed
it was galling to him to harness his horses
under Charlie’s eyes and listen to his bar-
rack about the work he lived by. Charlie
had a way of .standing propped against the
post of the shed, his pipe between his strong
teeth, a lurking grin in his eyes, the .sun
glinting on his fair hair. Terribly fixed
and firmly-rooted he looked, as he lounged
there with his arms folded and his legs
crossed ! Under his heavy amiability little
devils of malice were hidden. Duggan had
once given him a thrashing for throwing
stones at his horses when they were stand-
ing under a bauksia on the beach—that was
years before, but Charlie never forgot such
things. He leered as he watched Duggan
wasli down the back of the black mare.
“Still getting work out of that poor blasted
plug, Harry? By cripes, she owes you no-
thing? Had her hauling that damned shell-
grit for the last ten years, haven’t you?”
And when Duggan didn’t answer: “Don't
happen to want an offsider, do you, Harry?
It’s a game that would just suit me—pad-
ding about all day oil the beach scraping up
food for chickens.”
“You’d have to bend your back.” was
Duggan’s retort, coming in a low growl from
his throat; “I can’t see you doing that.
Better look for something that won’t put
too much strain on you.”
But Charlie showed no impulse to try
any kind of work. He loafed around the
jetty watching the boat come in or talking
to the fishermen as they mended their nets;
he lounged about the store with the
two or three other young fellows who
were always there, waiting for the mail to
come in—young Geary, one of the Verney
boys, the driver of the hotel car. The atti-
tude of these young fellows flattered Charlie,
(Continued on page 22.)


THE NUDE CULT HITS THE SUBURBS.


and made him feel he had done something in
the world ; they hung around him and grinned
at his jokes about Duggan or his comments
on any girls w T ho passed. He knew they
were afraid of him, afraid of the slumbering
strength in his big body and the queer lights
in his eyes. Hadn’t he put the fear of the
devil into them years ago, as a boy coming-
home from school with the crowd? He
knew a dozen little twfists of the arm that
could make them squirm, and it was hard
for him to keep from that sort of horseplay,
even now, as they stood around him, lapping
up his wit. In spite of their inner dislike
of Charlie a strange fascination drew them
to him, made them play up to him and say
or do things to win liis approval.
But sometimes he had moody fits and went
off alone, squatting on the rocks of the head-
land staring out to sea, or lying for hours
on the cliff in the sun with his felt hat over
his face. The sight of his prone figure
brought a secret fear to the women, and
they gave him a wide berth like sheep track-
ing away from .a dingo. They didn’t want
to say anything that would hurt Mag, but
it wasn’t comfortable to have Charlie around.
A change had come to the very atmosphere
of the Bay since his return : something harsh
and menacing w T as abroad on the air. “Why
don’t Harry Duggan clear him out?” they
asked one another. “If he’d any spunk he
wouldn’t let a big -waster like that loaf on
him and Mag. Pity he didn’t get a life
sentence when they took him away. Mag’d
have been better off.”
But Duggan, sweating on the beach, load-
ing his shell-grit into the bags, didn’t hear
what other people were saying. He was
absorbed in the secret drama that was going-
on in his own soul. Never till now had he
been troubled by the image of Charlie’s
father, or even thought about him: he had
only seen him once, killing a beast in the
slaughter-yards at Matura, and even his
features were vague. Did he have curly
hair and sleepy, brutal eyes, or was that
just a vision suggested by Charlie’s face?
Duggan didn’t know, and there was no one
to tell him. Mag had never talked of her
girlhood or of the people she had known
before she came to the Bay. Charlie’s father
belonged to a different life from the one
they led together. He had been dead over
twenty years now, thrown from his horse
when coming home from a spree, and Dug-
gan hadn’t worried what the fellow’s rela-
with Mag had been, or why he had
dodged giving the boy his name.
Charlie’s father hadn’t troubled him; but
now as he watched Mag hovering about
Charlie at the table, heaping his plate with
food, a secret jealousy stirred, spreading a
poison through his blood. It seemed as if
all the while they had been living together,
Mag had had some image in her mind hid-
den from him. Yes; every day he was grow-
ing surer of that! Deep down she was
brooding on the memory of the man she had
given herself to as a girl, and that was why
she flushed when Charlie came thumping
in along the verandah, why she gave a little
laugh every time he opened his mouth. She
doted on the fellow be-
cause he was like his
father—that was the
strength of it! Women
were like that: they
felt things in their blood.
Charlie’s grinning face
across the table mixed
itself up with that of the
young butcher at Matura
and roused a chaos of
obscure passion in him.
Sometimes in the middle
of his work he sat down
for a smoko on one of the
bags of shell-grit, and a
couple of hours later he
was still sitting there, his
cold pipe between his
teeth, and the horses
dozing till their noses
nearly touched the sand.
This matter of Charli-
was getting on his mind.
Where did the fellow get
the money he flung about
so freely, drinking at the
pub and buying chocolate
for the girls he took to
dances at the hall? There
was always a cigarette
in the corner of his
mouth, and tobacco wasn’t
to be had for nothing.
Duggan guessed where the few pounds that
Mag made by selling butter and eggs were
going, and the thought of that hurt like a
loose tooth. For Mag spent nothing on her-
self, never had done, and many a time she
had been hard pressed to keep Charlie
decently clothed when he was a boy.
It couldn’t go' on! No, he would have
to put his own oar in, even if it meant up-
setting the boat.
“Well,” he said, coming home late one
evening to find Mag out after the caws and
Charlie spread on a cane lounge under the
persimmon-tree, “about time you shook you,r-
self up a bit, isn’t it? Other people have to
keep their backs bent.”
“Some people were born that way,” was
Charlie’s easy retort. “I like mine straight.”
“You’re not going to keep it straight
at' my expense,” Duggan shot back. “No,
by Hell you’re not. I’ve stood you too long
already, loafing round on your mother. This
place isn’t a home for deadheads. You
haven’t as much as run the cows in for your
mother since the day you came.”
Charlie raised himself in his chair. “Toll
her I’ll have to go then,” he challenged.
“You’re not game, Duggan. She’d sooner
see your back than mine. You’ve crawled
in here and made a comfortable little home
for yourself and those old plugs of yours,
but you only got your chance because a
woman likes sonic sort of man about the
house. I’m the only man that’s needed now.
You try to edge me out and see what hap-
pens. You try it and see.”
His greenish eyes seemed subtle with some
secret knowledge as he flung his taunt. He
was confident, sure of himself. He had a
power over Mag that Duggan would never
have: in his bones Duggan believed that.
And it was torment for him to sit in the
living-room of an evening while Charlie
lounged on the sofa in his pants and singlet
playing the gramophone and Mag darned
socks by the fire. He couldn’t bring himself
to talk to Charlie; he felt himself drawing
into his shell like a snail. Even when he
was alone with Mag there was none of the
old intimacy. He felt that her nerves were
on edge: she was anxious to avoid talking
about Charlie; and it made everything she
said seem unreal.
“Why don’t you have it out?” a yoice
inside Duggan nagged at him. “Something’s
going to smash sooner or later. Better get
it over, no matter what the end is.”
But he funked the issue, tried to bury his
head in the sand. He was afraid of some-
thing incalculable in Mag, something that
had nothing to do with reason. She would
stick to Charlie, defend him with the blind
instinct of an. animal protecting her young.
Duggan took to' going off alone in the even-
ing, running his boat out from the little
rock-protected cove and rowing out to see
where the snapper and parrot-fish played
over a reef of dead coral, and a man could
lose himself in the dark spaces between the
stars overhead.
“Harry’s nursing a sore tooth,” the fisher-
men said. “Hasn’t got the guts to pull it
out.” And a little later, as they watched
him unload his shell-grit at the jetty, his
dark eyes sunken and a hint of thunder on
his swarthy brows: “Harry’ll break out one
of these days. Then God help the man that
gets in his road! Harry’s hands are slow
to close round anything, but he’s got a
hell of a grip.”
The winter changed to spring. Always
as soon as the warm weather came there
were little bunches of campers who came
down to the Bay, anchoring their boats in
the cove and putting up tents among the
tea-tree on the headland. Life took on a
gayer, livelier tint. Bathers in colored cos-
tumes sprawled upon the beach, the rocks
were cluttered with children looking for
cowries, men in short pants and sun-glasses
fished for whiting in the gutters left by
the Outgoing tide. Opal seas, and the flicker-
ing of butterflies through the blue-bright
air ! At nights there were dances in the hall,
and the firefly lights of lanterns winking
among the patches of banksia along the
beach.
Duggan, rowing home late one evening
from the reef, was weighed down by a black
A BIT TO GO ON WITH.
“And what did you say when he brought you the ring?”
“I said of course I couldn’t tell what was in the future, but I’d love him devdtedly
for the present.”
cloud of passion and remorse that the long
hours alone with himself on the sea had
not lifted. For the first time he had quar-
relled with Mag. Worse than that, he had
said shameful things, things he had never
really thought or felt—they had gushed out
of him like the bilge from a pump. And she
had stood there dumb, leaning against the
door of the kitchen, as if he had struck her
on. the mouth. Better if he had struck her!
There was something human in a release of
purely physical passion. But that cold venom
that came from the mouth like poison from
a snake- —Duggan felt sick with the memory
of it. How could he look her in the eyes
again? The only thing to do was to get
away to his shanty three miles up the beach
so that Mag would be relieved of the sight
of his face. She didn’t want anything from
him now: she was better alone with Charlie.
He waited for the lift of a comber and
then shot in through the opening in the
rocks t<f where the black shapes of other
anchored boats showed in the dim light.
It was only when he was shipping his
oars that the flicker of an electric torch in
a motor-launch thirty yards away pricked
him to an awareness of his surroundings.
Some clairvoyant, sense seemed to awaken
in him, making him bristle like an animal
that has smelt an enemy. Or was it that
he had caught a glimpse of Charlie’s fair
hair in the light of the torch that had shone
for a moment and gone out.
A faint drip came from his oars as he
paddled over to the launch; passion gathered
till it formed a hard knot in his brain. Ho
waited for the light to shine again, and then
saw it gleam yellow for a moment on
Charlie’s face and hunched figure as he bent
over one of the lockers aft.
Duggan’s voice came out before he could
check himself. “You damned rat! Wbat’re
you doing there?”
Darkness and silence closed over both of
them; then a light flashed in Duggan’s face,
dazzling his eyes.
“Oho! So it’s you!” came Charlie’s voice.
It was thick, for he had been drinking.
Duggan caught hold of the side of the launch
and began to climb up, though his fingers
were numb with holding the oars. He knew
very well why Charlie was there. There
had been a certain amount of looting going
on all winter. Things had been missing from
the store-boat, and from the unoccupied cot-
tages that stood about the beach ; but there
was an animal cunning about Charlie that
made him clever at throwing suspicion on
other people—stray campers, the half-castes
who had their huts at the mouth of the
saltwater wreck. In spite of liis bluster,
he was oppressed by the fear of those dark
walls that for so long had shut / out the
daylight for him.
Duggan was thinking of Mag, and Mag
alone, as he gained the deck. His own ends
would be served by getting Charlie sent
down again, but he put that idea behind him.
'He wasn’t going to have Mag disgraced a
second time.
“Look here, you slinking cur!” he began,
“you’ve been ratting other people’s pro-
perty for months. And n0w”....
Something crashed down on his head. It
was not a man he had cornered but a beast,
the same beast that Ramsay had encountered
three years before in the darkness of his
store. Dazedly they grappled together,
swaying, cursing, breathing threats, and
Duggan’s fingers were at Charlie’s throat
as they went over the side. The head of one
of them hit the edge of the dinghy below
with' a dull thud; there was a convulsive
splashing as the water received them. But
deep down in his mind Duggan had a sense
of sinking his fingers into something, gripping
it tight. All his conscious life was in his
fingers. The sea was choking in his throat
and his brain was spinning, but he held on.
Lights, the sound of voices across the
water, a splashing of oars! It was Duggan
who was first dragged out of the water and
hauled on to the deck of the launch, his
right hand closed tight on a brown muffler.
He had life enough to mutter to the man
who bent over him: “Look for Charlie.”
“Eli.”
“Look for Charlie. My boat capsized....
out there on the rocks.... and he went in
after me.”
The passion had gone out of him. Some-
where in his muddled brain he knew that
he had been struggling with a wraith, that
Charlie had slipped away from him when
they fell. And no one must guess how he
had come upon him.
Afterwards in the long weeks of convales-
cence, when he felt that his- head was stuffed
with cotton-wool and the world around had
melted into smoke, Duggan sometimes won-
dered where the instinct had come from that
had formed those words on his lips. Deep
down it must have been buried, below the
level of his conscious mind. A mad world
it was altogether! A man never knew wliat
was really going on inside him. There in
the inner centre of his being he had felt
himself responsible for Mag’s son, as much
as for Mag herself. He had taken on some-
thing more than the job of keeping a roof
over her head when he married her; he had
accepted her past and all that went with
it. In spite of the savage jealousy that
had tormented him for months, threads of
loyalty bound him to Charlie, too.
He was only dimly aware of the change
of feeling that had taken place at the Bay.
The crack on his head nearly splitting open
his skull had carried him into a muffled
world of his own, where the only things that
happened were the changing of bandages,
the shifting of pillows and the coming and
going of people in the next room. But a
wave of sentiment had been washing round
Charlie ever since the morning that his
lifeless body was found among the rocks.
It was just like Charlie, they said, to dive
in fully-clothed when he saw someone drown-
ing ; he might have been a bit cranky some-
times, but he had a heart as big as a bul-
lock’s and never thought of himself. A
little too simple—that was all that was
wrong with him! And what could you
expect of a fellow who was kicked on the
head when lie was a youngster?
“Charlie never had a chance,” old Goyt
said. “People were always ready to sink
the boot into him. That old Shylock of a
Ramsay ought to be rode on a rail for
getting him sent down when they had a
rumpus in the store. Everyone knowed it
was only the sort of lark all high-spirited
young fellow’s get up to when they have a
bit of drink in them.”
And the women, talking together, remem-
bered wdiat an attractive youngster he had
been. “Always with that happy-go-lucky
smile on him. I don’t think no one ever
seen him without a smile.... Poor Mag!
It makes your heart ache to see her riding
round after the cows with that look on her
face, as if she’d come to a dead-end and
had nothing left to live for.”
They were quite sure all Mag’s hopes for
the future were buried with Charlie; even
Duggan believed that, as he pottered about
the place and lent her a hand with the
milking. . There was a strange quietness
about her, the darkness of a still night in
her eyes. Duggan was convinced she was
living on dreams of the boy he himself had
turned into a heroic figure; calling up the
image of Charlie and telling herself what
a fine future he’d have carved out for him-
self if he hadn’t been struck down in youth.
That was the way with women! They must
build a romance round the people that be-
longed to them if they were to get any
comfort out of life.
He was satisfied to let it go
at that, and avoided mentioning
Charlie’s name; but one even-
ing, when they were sitting on
the verandah in the dusk,
watching the fireflies among the
straggling bananas, he was
roused to desperation by the
way she, too, avoided it. There
seemed something unnatural in
her talk about the blight in
the potatoes and the red cow’s
new calf.
“What’s the trouble, Mag?”
he asked jerkily. “Brooding
over Charlie, aren’t you? God
knows I’ve often wished he’d left
me where I was and saved him-
self. That’s the living truth.”
Mag winced, sitting still in
her chair. “Don’t, Harry.
There’s no need of that sort of
talk between me and you. I
know.”
He glanced at her furtively,
the quiet face with its cloud
of darkness over it, the heavy
figure that seemed planted in
the earth.
“Know what?”
“That Charlie didn’t go out like you say.
He wasn’t that sort.”
An awkward silence held them awhile
and then, sensing his discomfort, she said
with a jerky emotion :
“It doesn’t matter; I don’t want to
know anything. All my life I tried to be
good to Charlie, because I couldn’t like him.
Seemed to me he was like he was because
I hated him before he was born. His father,
too. It can’t be helped now. [When things
go crook in the beginning” She stopped,
her eyes becoming suddenly concentrated in
the dusk. “There’s one of them poddies in
the bananas,” she said.
But she didn’t rise to chase it out. It
was merely an escape she wanted from a
world of emotion where ,she felt submerged
and lost. That deep pool with its forest
of swaying weeds! Duggan, sitting beside
her in the dusk, had a sense of being one
with her that had never come to him before.
It was the last time they ever mentioned
the interloper.
Two to a Kiss.
THERE arc pranks the performance of
which
Is more prudent afar from the throng.
If you’d stand on your head in a ditch,
A la Carroll’s Chevalier Blanc,
You may balance far better alone.
But I draw your attention to this—
Whatever you do on your own,
There must always be two to a kiss.
One admits there are moments of time,
And occasions when two are the deuce.
For example, when seeking a rhyme
That’s elusive or cash that is loose.
But consider the lovers who pair
’Neath the cynical sanction of Dis —
I' faith, they seem fully aware
There must always be two to a kiss.
In the gods’ geological plan.
Youth’s volcanic upheaval must pass
To subsidence, avoid it who can !
Of our lyric illusions, alas,
Scant residuum now appertains,
And love’s gold is eroded, I wis:
But this stubborn substratum remains—
There must always be two to a kiss.
Till the roses of shadow that sway
’Neath the stars shall have silenced the
sun,
And of all the delights of our day
Comes the last and the loveliest one.
Till an end be of strivers and strifes,
A term to our bale and our bliss.
Till Death lays his cold lips upon Life’s,
There must always be two to a kiss.
QUEENSLAND.

THE CHRISTMAS TREE
By J.H.M.Abbott
FROM the private journals of that friend
of my extreme youth the Baron Aon
Big, which were bequeathed to me as a
boy and have never until recently been
translated from the original German, _it is
plain that the old warrior was no stickler
for the conventions. But, on the whole, the
majority of his contemporaries were inclined
to be lenient with the genial “Mr. Augustus.
Even the extraordinary incident of the
Baron’s Christmas tree seems to have been
regarded rather from a humorous than a
serious point of view, not only by high
authorities of Government but by every class
of the community.
From his own account of it, he does not
seem to consider that he did anything at all
that he should not have done. AVe may, our-
selves, at this distance of time, sympathise
with him or not, but even the most reasonable
of us cannot but admit that, in this case,
Mr. Augustus went a little far. One cannot
but think that had the thing happened during
the pro-consulship of Lachlan Macquarie,
New South AA 7 ales might have been the poorer
by the Baron’s banishment. The complacent
Sir Charles Fitzroy could be much more
tolerant in these matters than his decorous
and austere predecessor.
The Baron Von Big was the proprietor of
two estates, which he had acquired as grants
from Governor Macquarie soon after Ins
arrival in the colony, and had considerably
added to by purchase. He made his home at
Pampeluna, near Castle Hill, where I knew
him not long before he died —at the respect-
able age of one hundred years—in 1890. The
other property was a station on the Mac-
quarie River below Bathurst, which he had
called Salamanca. Both places received their
names in memory of his experiences m the
Peninsular War, where he had served as an
officer of the German Legion, and eventually
as an Assistant-Commissary with the British
Army. It is with Salamanca that this
extract from his journal has. to do, and
the period with which it deals is the end of
1846.
“The year 1847,” he writes, “was to con-
tain the thirtieth anniversary of my arrival
in New South Wales, since I had disem-
barked in Sydney at the beginning of
January, 1817, in the eighth year of the
reign of my friend and benefactor Major-
General Macquarie. I had prospered exceed-
ingly during these three decades, and was by
this time in exceedingly comfortable circum-
stances. This good fortune was due to the
fine quality of the land I held on the Mac-
quarie River, which from the beginning I
had turned to the best advantage by the
judicious and careful breeding of cattle, and;
later on, by wool-growing.
“So during the year 1846 I made up my
mind that the coming Christmas would be
A SURPRISE PACKET.
“What’s the new baby’s name?”
“Onyx. You see, it’s six years since the last one. Onyx-pectea."
rendered remarkable at Salamanca by some
sort of celebration. I could not decide, how-
ever, the manner in which the joyous busi-
ness was to be conducted, and was still con-
sidering this plan and that when a happy
suggestion by an old friend resolved all my
doubts. My friend was James Hector
Duveen, Commissioner of Crown Lands at
Bathurst, possessed of a resourcefulness in
the art of entertainment that was quite
unique. ‘Jimmy’ Duveen he was always called,
and there were few settlers west of the
Blue Mountains who had not a, kindly regard
for the lovable fellow. . In his appearance
he was extraordinarily like Shakspeare s feu
John Falstaff. He loved good cheer and was
every inch a sad rogue. His prejudices with
regard to conventional morality, were, as tew
as my own, and as to womankind his taste
was quite catholic. It would not, I grant,
be a good thing for society if there were too
many of the sort of Augustus Von Big and
Jimmy Duveen, but as a leavening
of the mass we have had our uses.
Womankind could not do without
the Augustuses and Jimmies, in
this world or the next.
“It was when going down coun-
try to see to the shipment of my
wool after the shearing of 1840
that I spent an evening at his
house in William-street, whilst
passing through Bathurst. An
evening with Jimmy, it must be
mentioned, extended from sunset to
sunrise, and to be invited to dinner
meant the consumption of three
meals. You dined at five, supped
at midnight and breakfasted in the
early dawn on ham and eggs and
beer. A hard head and a good digestion were
essential for those whom Mr. Duveen enter-
tained. Drunkenness and biliousness were
alike detestable to that hearty fellow.
“On this occasion I was the only_ guest,
but that made no difference; and it was
whilst we were engaged upon supper that
I mentioned the design I had in mind. My
old friend immediately entered _ with enthu-
siasm into the spirit of the thing, and was
emphatic that it must be done properly. _ I
must, he said, entertain the whole. district
and make the entertainment a function that
the countryside would never be likely to for-
get. I told him of the difficulty I had ex-
perienced in deciding what form the festi-
val was to take, and he listened patiently
to all I had to say, though I could see that
he was already decided upon what should be
done. When I told him that the best I
could think of was an invitation to the
people of the district, both rich and poor, to
come and camp at Salamanca for several
days which would be devoted to feasting and
revelry, horse-racing and games, he nodded
his agreement that something on those lines
was essential. But that, he said, was not
all. He had a magnificent idea. Would I
kindly allow him to consider it a while —
merely a few minutes? So I drank a bumper,
lit a cigar and sat back in my chair whilst
Jimmy Duveen communed with himself on
my behalf. ,
“ ‘The thing to do, my dear Augustus,
he said impressively, raising himself in his
chair, ‘is to present the people with some
entertainment so originally presented as to
be a novelty. In your own country, in Ger-
many, I understand that one of the_ most
characteristic symbols of Christmastidc is
the .Christmas tree. Therefore, it would be
entirely fitting that you should make the
Christmas tree the central feature of your
celebrations.’
“‘A Christmas tree, my dear Jimmy!’ I
exclaimed. ‘What? A little pine-tree, or
a fir, with colored wax candles hanging to
its branches, and toys, and _ tinsel deco-
rations? Surely, my good friend, that is
rather for a children’s party than for such
a gathering as I have in mind?’
“ ‘Baron !’ he bellowed, ‘I didn’t mean that
sort of Christmas tree. I meant something
like this.’
“And then in fullest detail he explained his
idea, and it fascinated me. When presently
I come to relate the story of that noteworthy
Christmas at Salamanca, it will be readily
understood why.
*
“It was most delightful and agreeable
weather, which lasted without break or
blemish from the time of my return over the
mountains until well into the month of
January. We had
been favored in the
late spring with
bountiful rains, and
the country was at
its best. Fat cattle
stood belly-deep in
rich grasses on the
river flats, and the
sheep camped lazily
on the hillsides be-
neath shady trees
through perfect
days of glorious
summer. It was a
time of peace and
plenty, of entranc-
ing days and
nights.
“T h e prepara-
tions for our cele-
bration absorbed
all hands at Sala-
manca for several
weeks. Accommo-
dation was pro-
vided for more than
a hundred in huts
of bark and boughs,
which I caused to
be erected along
the bank of the
river, overlooking
an extensive water-
hole in which my
guests might dis-
port themselves during the heat of the day.
The huts stood in the shelter of a row ot
magnificent gum-trees, which afforded them
pleasant shade, and over the roof of each
of them was stretched a tarpaulin to
render the little dwelling rainproof in case
of inclement •weather —a precaution that for-
tunately turned out to be quite unnecessary.
A large marquee tent, borrowed from the
officer commanding the military detachment
doing garrison duty in Bathurst —a company
of the 11th North Devonshires, under my
friend Captain Hilary Cutbush —provided a
comfortable dining-room and a well-equipped
cook-house was placed under the control
of Mr. Duveen’s cook, Alphonse Dufreyre.
With a few other more intimate friends, the
Crown Lands Commissioner was accommo-
dated in the Salamanca homestead. All that
could be thought of for the comfort of my
guests was liberally provided. A racecourse
was marked out in the home paddock, and
a cricket pitch prepared not far from the
encampment by the riverside. And there was
a large hayshed near the house which was
turned into a sort of tap-room, where bar-
rels of beer, rum and wine were arranged for
the convenience and comfort of visitors, an
attendant being available to serve it out as
required at any hour of the day or night.
I may really congratulate myself, I think,
on having done the thing very well.
“A few hundred yards up the river from
where the homestead overlooked it, the
Murran Creek runs into the main stream —-
a she-oak shaded rivulet of exceeding beauty
and seclusion. Maybe fifty yards from its
juncture with the Macquarie there is a
grassy flat in a bend below the high banks,
and there grows a magnificent eucalyptus
of the sort locally styled ‘apple-tree,’ with
far-spreading branches extending out over
the creek and stretching above the bank. In
the early morning a hillock on the higher
ground shelters it
from the sun, so
that until well into
the forenoon it
stands in cool and
delightful shadow.
This splendid giant
was selected by
Jimmy Duveen as
our Christmas tree,
from the branches of
which were to be
suspended gifts,
which were to- be
drawn for by lot.
Half a dozen special
prizes were reserved
for those young
settlers of the dis-
trict who, although
comfortably off, had
not yet entered the
bonds of wedlock.
The presents they
were to receive were
the pieces de resist-
ance of this auspici-
ous occasion. For
the rest the boughs
of the great tree
were to have sus-
pended from them
such acceptable gifts
as little barrels of
rum and brandy,
larger ones contain-
ing beer; saddles,
sets of harness, rolls
of cloth and colored
prints and ginghams,
axes, boxes of
tobacco, York hams,
sides of bacon, rid-
ing-whips, double-
barrelled guns,
bonnets for the
ladies, warm over-
coats —everything in
short, that could
be useful to country
people, to eat, to
drink, or to bedeck
their persons.
“The Rev. Dr. Broughton, the Anglican
bishop of Australia —his huge diocese was
not subdivided into the sees of Newcastle,
Melbourne and Adelaide until the following
year-—happened to be staying in Bathurst
over Christmas, and had promised to attend
the distribution of gifts at the Christmas
tree on the forenoon- of the sacred anniver-
sary. I have since heard that he regretted
bitterly having attended, but I could never
quite understand his chagrin, or why lie so
hurriedly left the scene before our little cere-
mony was complete, for it was a most novel
and unusual way of encouraging the institu-
tion of marriage, a formality which, from
the earliest days of the colony, had only
been too often neglected.
“Christmas Eve saw the beginning of the
revels. At the homestead I entertained a
large party of guests at dinner, and a notable
banquet was spread in the marquee at the
encampment beside the river. Dancing in
the woolshed followed, and it was not until
sunrise that the festivities abated in order
to permit of breakfast and the final prepara-
tions for the great event of the celebra-
tions. Mr Duveen was to drive a waggon-
ette. out from Bathurst in the morning, which
would transport the half-dozen lovely prizes
which were to make the gathering for ever
famous. Until the actual ceremony took
place the Christmas-tree was jealously
secluded from general inspection by a num-
ber of my employees, who greatly appre-
ciated the privilege of guarding the great
‘apple-tree’ in its setting in the bend of the
Murran Creek.
“About ten o’clock all the guests assembled
at the homestead to be marshalled into a
procession which would presently move to
the junction of the creek and the river, where
it was arranged that I was to deliver a
short address and make some explanation
of the method to be employed in the distri-
bution of gifts, particularly those intended
for the single young landowners.
' “Where the shady creek ran into the river
a halt was called, and, amid the most enthu-
siastic cheering, I mounted a stump.
“ ‘My very good friends,’ I said to them,
when the cheering had subsided, ‘we are now
about t.o come to the most important part of
our festivities —the distribution of gifts from
the Christmas-tree, which will be drawn by
lot. Round yonder bend in the creek the
gift-tree is located, and I think that you will
find suitable presents provided for each and
every one of you. There are, particularly
half'a dozen gifts for those young men who
are single, which will, I think, excite the
admiration of all of you. It gives me the
very greatest pleasure to have with us this
morning his Grace the Lord Bishop of Aus-
tralia, the Right Reverend William Grant
Broughton, Doctor of Divinity, and our very
good friend and pastor. I am sure that he
will have the greatest pleasure in presenting
the prizes after the distribution has been
drawn. I will not detain you here longer
than to call for three cheers for Doctor
Broughton, and then we shall proceed a little
further up the creek to the Christmas tree.
‘‘Most heartily were the cheers given, the
Bishop raising his hat and bowing in acknow-
ledgment, and then we resumed our progress
up the creek, the band, stationed on the
higher hank, playing a lively march, as the
excited people crowded along the narrow lower
bank of the pretty stream. Quite suddenly the
Christmas tree came into the view of those m
the lead of the procession, of whom the
Bishop and I were, of course, the foremost.
“I heard his Grace gasp as he suddenly
halted, and thought that he must be some-
what taken aback by the lavish nature of my
outlay—l did not really at the time under-
stand his feelings. Nor do I altogether under-
“THIS LOOKS LIKE A THROW IN FOR ME.”
stand them now. However, this was what he
in swings suspended from the
branches of the great ‘apple-tree,’ were six
of the loveliest, and I think perhaps among
the naughtiest, of the young ladies I had been
able to find in Sydney. They had been
chosen for their perfection of form as well
as handsomeness of feature. They wore only
a slight drapery of muslin, and really looked
mosf attractive against the sylvan back-
ground which surrounded them veritable
wood-nymphs. All about them dangled from
the limbs of the big tree the other Christ-
mas gifts enumerated above, but none had
eyes for anything beside those shapely girls.
I felt a thrill of pride :as I turned to the
forward-pressing throng, and made my bow
of acknowledgment to the_ cries of wonder
and admiration which this unusual sight
called forth from the people. I turned to
the Bishop. To my astonishment he was
deadly pale. He stared at me for a moment
without speaking. Then he whispered:
“ ‘God forgive you, Baron —you are a
icicked man!’ . ,
“Not deigning to listen to me, he strode
across the creek and disappeared up the
further bank. I learned that he did not go
near the homestead again, but walked into
Bathurst on foot—a matter of more than
seven miles! _
“However, despite the Bishop s strange be-#
havior, the celebration was a great _ success,
and all were pleased with their prizes. It
will be long before the Christmas of 184 b
at Salamanca will be forgotten in the west-
ern districts of New South Wales.
The Speckled Bird.
ABOVE the sick man’s narrow bed
Are windows dark and long ;
The tearless watcher lifts her head
To starlight and a song.
There's something. singing in the dark
Beneath the swift clouds flying,
Up in the tree-tops of the park;
Singing, laughing, crying!
Up in the pine-trees’ slender spars,
Sitting alone and singing,
Exulting to the morning stars
Above the dark earth swinging!
O weary face and shaded light,
O hoarse and shallow breath!
How slowly through the liouis of nigbt
Comes fair and kindly death!
Out where the star of morning shines
A wind is rising in the pines
And in the tree-tops of the park
There’s broken music, flowing,
Laughing and sobbing in the dark
Because the dawn wind s blowingl

ABORIGINALITIES
“E.S.”: “There used to be a terrible lot
o’ wallabies round here,” said Jep. “Fair
cows they were, always spoilin’ the crops.
Couldn’t keep ’em out nohow. But at last
I snared one in the scrub, an’ instead o’
killin’ him I dressed him up like an’ organ-
grinder’s monkey—red jacket an’ frilled cap
—an’ strapped a small bell on his neck. On
a nice clear night I let him go, an’ he did
go, too —through the scrub an’ along the
gullies, tryin’ his hardest to catch up to his
old mates, an’ them doin’ record leaps to get
away from him. In a couple o’ nights he’d
rounded up all the kangaroos an’ wallabies
an’ ’possums of these parts, an’ lie must ’ave
overlanded ’em to the north somewhere, for
I haven’t seen a track of ’em since. He was
the best scarecrow I ever invented.”

“Mundowie”: I camped one night in
Widow Ilapps’s barn, on the Pine River
(Q.). Scores of travellers had camped there
at different times, it being a convenient
shelter, and otherwise little used. Widow
Happs was a little, thin woman with a
wrinkled face ; whenever she had a guest in
the barn she sat by his fire and talked to him
for hours —mostly about the men she’d met
there. “It’s wonderful where some of them do
get to,” she said. “There was a young fellow
camped here one wet night. Hard up he

was, with a fruit-tin for a tea-billy, but he
seemed all right. Twelve months afterwards
he wrote to me from McKinlay, where he
was stock-ridin’, and he said he’d tramped
3000 miles before he unrolled his bluey
there. I didn’t get another word of him for
three years, and then he rode up one day
all spick and span in a trooper’s uniform —

“Plankton”: Blow-
ing bubbles is a
domestic duty with
some fishes. The
Malayan undi-colli
(climbing perch) is
an exponent of the
art; so are the
gur ami (a fine-
flavored fish weigh-
ing sometimes 20
pounds) and the
tiny Siamese fight-
ing-fish. The last-
named species has
normally quite a
drab appearance, but
when excited by the
proximity of a rival
his body scintillates
with gorgeous irides-
cent coloring. The
beautiful little
Chinese paradise-fish
also blows bubbles in
the breeding season.
The froth-blowing is
performed by the
males (it naturally
would be), the mass
of bubbles being used
as a floating nest in
which the eggs are
supported. The para-
dise-fish is the cham-
pion at this job, and
builds bigger and
better than the other
three species. The
nest is quite large
and dome-s hape d,
floating well above
water level. The
bubble-nest is
strengthened by the
addition of saliva
from the mouth of
the blower. After
the job is completed
dad guards the nest
vigilantly until the
eggs are hatched.
He keeps his weather
eye on mum, for, sad
to say, her tastes are
cannibalistic.
“Ilereva Momo”: Transport to and from
the Papuan mining fields is difficult. Boys
must be fed, and the unfortu-
nate prospector generally finds
that his stalwart Goaribari
carrier has manfully nosed his
way through three-quarters of
his load of rice before even
sighting camp. Adamson, near
Mondo, would have been in a
desperate plight but for a kindly
Goidala chief. There was plenty
in the land, and for a pinch
of salt the problem was solved.
But the camp fox-terrier took a
hand. Objecting to the old
chief’s appearance, smell and
manners, he chased him one day
out of the camp and on to a
boulder well out m the river. Too
proud to fight, the chief sat there
and conducted a diplomatic cor-
respondence with the dog across
ten yards of torrent till Adam-
son returned. The mischief was
done and the food-supplies
ceased. Adamson was getting
worried when the patrol-officer
arrived. Papuan p.-o.’s are noth-
ing if not efficient and the old
chief was promptly brought into
camp. The Court was in ses-
sion when he arrived, and foxy
was solemnly led in under arrest
and tried on a charge of intimi-
dation. Evidence for the prose-
cution was given by Adamson
and his mate, and by the chief
with point and enthusiasm. No
defence being offered, the
accused was sentenced to six
months in gaol, and on the fol-
lowing day the chief jeered joy-
ously as the prisoner, chained to
a John Hop, was removed from
the camp. Pood supplies are now
as plentiful as ever, and the
Government has gained a strong
adherent.
‘‘Bilbo”: When our kelpie was chasing
scorched rabbits that were fleeing from
burning blackberry bushes one of the bun-
nies doubled back and led his pursuer across
the fire. The kelpie yelped pitifully as the
hot coals seared his feet, but stuck to the
chase, and not until the last rabbit had been
scotched did he pay any attention to his
injuries. He examined them with a critical
eye. The hind feet were blistered, and it
didn’t look as though licking them would
do any good. So he hunted round till he

found a piece of wool, teased it up, and.
after some stiff struggling with mouth and
forepaws, wound the wool round his sore
tootsies.

“Uramao” : A noted traveller that comes
annually from the far north to Australia
cuts Maoriland out of its itinerary for some
reason unexplained, though stragglers have
been seen on rare occasions. This is the
whimbrel, a distant relation of the godwit
that travels the same route and makes M.L.
its objective for the summer. The eighth
recorded appearance was on the west coast
of the South Island last September, the first
visit recorded being 52 years ago at Canter-
bury. All the evidence seems to indicate
that the occasional visitors have made solo
flights across the Tasman.

“Tomjoey”: City lads who come shooting
on my place fire 20 shots for every rabbit they
knock over. These chaps tramp for miles, tak-
ing long shots and sending the rabbits
scuttling into their burrows. There’s a
much easier way. Go out at dusk,
march facing the wind, and go straight
towards a big warren with your rifle, carry-
ing- a little branch of a tree. Lie down flat
on the ground about 20 feet from the warren,
put the branch in front of you, and some
cartridges handy on a bit of bark. In about
10 minutes a few little bunnies will come
out. Leave them alone. Then bigger ones
will emerge, until finally the whole
warren is covered with bunnies of all sizes,
some playing around, some washing their
faces like cats, and bucks kicking and fight-
ing. Then raise your rifle, select a rabbit
about three-parts grown, and shoot it in
the head. Reload, and shoot another. Repeat
until you have as many as you can carry
home, then get up and collect the slain. No,
the rabbits won’t all dive back into the
burrows when the first shot is fired. The
darned little fools will not take a scrap of
notice, chiefly because the ground deflects
the noise of the shot up into the air, in view
of which the closer to the surface of the
ground you have the muzzle of your rifle,
short of blowing up dust, the better.
THE PLAIN BROWN BEES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The hive of bees I robbed one day out on
Iviama Creek
Were only common nigger bees—mere bush-
bees, so to speak.
They were not crossed with fancy strains
in scientific style,
They owned no Langstroth cubby-house with
comb-frames by the mile,
But in a common messmate-tree, outside
of Crookwell town,
They plied their trade and stored the comb
that later won renown.
A man could almost always find a hive in
hollow trees
In those far days when men were men and
bees were plain brown bees.
When I arrived from Gundagai and pitched
camp on the creek,
I cooled my heels —my palate, too —in
Coffey’s for a week.
Then when I sought my camp again a
cocky said to me:
“Say, can you rob a hive of bees? And can
you fell a tree?”
“What, rob a hive of bees?” I asked. “My
masterpiece is that.
And fell a tree? For years I felled mill logs
on Blanket Flat!
I won the chop at Sapling Creek, and later
at Carew’s,
The District Axemen’s Champion prize, the
gift of Billy Hughes.”
lie laughed and said : “Why, you’re the one;
I'll try you out, me lad.”
(I could have said a few things more, but
modesty foi’bade).
Next morn the bullock-dray came down with
half a dozen men
Whose hands I saw would grasp an axe
far handier than a pen.
I brushed the lads aside withal, and drove
the springboards in—
“ You mend the fences when they break,”
said I, “I’ll have a spin.”
The tree was full six-hundred feet in height
and thick and straight;
The first chip I dislodged they weighed—it
passed the hundredweight.
To cut the story short, by noon I got that
sapling down ;
Its crashing, smashing timbers shook the
roofs of Crookwell town.
A crowd of men came o’er the Flat the
giant prone to find,
And by the swinging cans we saw they had
an axe to grind.
We filled their cans, some sixty-odd (by
custom ’twas their due) ;
The president of Crookwell Shire, we gave
his Worship two.
With thanks they called us dinkum sports.
We said, “Cut out the thanks,”
And started syphoning to fill four-hundred
gallon tanks.
Bright, rich and clear the honey streamed,
like water fresh-distilled,
And never slackened in its flow till ten
good tanks were filled.
“I guess, good-fellow-me-lad,” said I, “we’ll
try a crack with these.
And leave the cobbler tank intact to winter-
feed the bees.”
“A good idea,” the boss replied, “we’ll now
put in the peg;
I’m not the chap that slays the goose that
lays the golden egg.
And you, good-fellow-me-lad,” said he, “pray
now disclose your due.”
“Me? Why, a quid, of course,” says I. He
handed over two.
He said, “You swing a clever axe. Your
bushcraft I admire ;
I’ll always have a word of praise for George
T. Smith, the liar.”

“Med.” : The bullrout mentioned by “Bad
Australian” (B. 18/11/’3l) is by no means
the most poisonous fish found in Queensland
waters. The stone fish (Synanceja horrida )
licks him hollow. It
is a repulsive, spiny,
warty creature which
exactly simulates the
broken coral of the
pools in which it
lives. Its back is
covered with spines,
at the base of which
are glands secreting
a virulent. poison
with a selective
action on the nervous
system. The slight-
est pressure on the
back of a stone-fish
forces out the poison,
which travels dqwn
a groove in the spine
to the wound. There
is immediate agonis-
ing pain, which lasts
for days, and may be
followed by months
of illness or death.
It is a good rule to
don stout boots when
walking over coral.
But the worst case
of fish poisoning I
have seen was caused
by the humble cat-
fish. The victim de-
served all he got, for
he was dynamiting
fish in Sydney’s
Middle Harbor. He
grabbed at one of
the stunned fish and,
unfortunately for
himself, caught it.
When he was brought
to my surgery about
an hour later his
hand was three times
its normal size and
his arm was red to
the shoulder. He
was in intense pain
and as silly as the village halfwit. The fellow
was sick for days.
“R. 5.11.” : I believe I am the last survivor
of the “fifteen esquires” of Cadarga station
(Q.), referred to by “Mundowie” (B.
11/11/’3l). I got a job there fortuitously.
I came to the adjoining station, Boondooma,
in 1868, and started with 15,000 sheep to
the Flinders River. The party consisted of
myself, Fleming (overseer), Sullivan (horse
driver) and 15 Malcoola Islanders. When
we reached Redbank station, the islanders
seized the axes and tomahawks and refused
to go on with the sheep. Fleming rode away
for help. Sullivan and I got the weapons
from the blacks, and told them to clear out,
which they did. The station sent up some
abos. and told us to return with the sheep
to Boondooma. When we reached Cadarga
I left them, and became one of the “esquires.
Here I met Duncan Clerk, whom I had
previously seen in England. He was not a
jackeroo, but with C. A. Ker (another
“esquire”) had previously owned Burran-
dowan station. When I had been a short
time on the station the owner, C. C. Mac-
donald, arrived from England. He said to
me: “When I was in Sydney I found tlie
‘fifteen esquires’ were the talk of the town.
Now I want you to tell me what they are
all doing.” I did so, as far as I was able.
When I was in England in 1920 I met one
of the “esquires,” Allan Clerk (brother of
Duncan Clerk). He had been living for
some 40 years in retirement at the White
House, Clevedon, having married a well-to-
do lady. He died a few years ago. C. C.
Macdonald’s partner was Maclaren. Every
day about 6 p.m. the “esquires” would line
up and he would give them each a tot of
rum. I met Maclaren in 1872 at Daandine
station. He was travelling with sheep, hav-
ing lost his share of Cadarga.

inscription: “Sacred to the memory of Wil-
liam Barak, Aboriginal King of the Yarra
Yarra Tribe. Died at Coranderrk 15th
August, 1903, aged 85 years. A quiet, good
Christian.” A more imposing monument of
marble is to take the place of this unworthy
piece of board. Derrimut sleeps in Mel-
bourne General Cemetery under a stone
“erected by a few colonists to commemorate
the noble act of the native chief Derrimut,
who, by his timely information given October,
1835, to the first colonists, Messrs. Fawkner,
Lancy, Evans, Henry Batman and their de-
scendants, saved them from massacre planned
by some of the up-country tribes of aborig-
ines. Derrimut closed his mortal career in
the Benevolent Asylum, May 28, 1864, aged
54 years.” King Billy’s grave at Ballarat
is also marked with a stone, the lettering of
which has become indecipherable. He was
the last of the Ballarat natives. At Geelong
is the grave of Billy Lee, with an inscrip-
tion in verse above :
Coo-ee! Coo-ee! Billy Lee.
Station mates in sympathy,
Grieved in spirit one and all,
Join together in the call
Of “Farewell” we send to thee.

“Wandi”: In the mocking-birds’ section
the olive-backed oriole deserves mention. Its
own notes are clear and melodious, and it
imitates the calls of several other birds to
perfection. In some parts it is known as
the cedar pigeon, from its fondness for the
berries of the white cedar. It is the bird
chiefly responsible for the spread of the mk-
weed, the berries of which are another ot its
favorites. Where a scrub is felled and burnt
on the mid-western rivers, a thick growth
of the tenacious weed-pest quickly follows;
I have seen new farms covered with it,
though not a plant was noticed in the vicinity
before the burning. The oriole lurks in
the brushes, where the dropped seed lies
dormant till the brushes are cleared. It
has a habit of pillaging in company with
the bell magpies, and of mimicking those
birds’ calls at .such times, as if its purpose
were to rivet attention and put the blame
of the robbery on them. AVlien doing this
the oriole is planted under the cover of
thick boughs. The dusky birds go after
fruit in stealthy silence, and when the
oriole betrays them by mocking their cries
in a loud voice they have to .shift. They arc
more suspicious of humans than the oriole.

“C. Coral” : Entertained at an island home
in Torres Strait recently, I was surprised
when the wife of the Government official
served up a delicious dish of tripe. As the only
beef supplies come out of a tin, I ventured a
question, and found that the tripe, which
was similar in flavor and everything else to
the ordinary down-south variety, came from
the green turtle! Another tasty dish was
fried turtle liver. Where Bulamakau labels
are the only feature on the meat-shelves
usually, such menu items make a most wel-
come change. But although I’ve been years
in the North, it was the first time that I’d
tasted turtle tripe.

“L.W.”: The man whose shining stirrup-
iron attracted the lightning which killed
him (B. 25/11/’3l) supplies one more reason
why the Australian should adopt the Mexi-
can wooden stirrup. It is lighter, offers
less severe wear to riding-boots, gives the
foot a more comfortable resting-place on a
long ride and, above all, will not catch and
firmly grip the foot of a rider who is un-
expectedly thrown, as the stirrup-iron has
done hundreds of times with many fatal
results. In two years on horseback in
North Queensland I used the only pair of
Mexican stirrups seen in those parts, _ and
yet every horseman I talked to admitted
their many advantages. Why are they so
stubbornly conservative?
* * * *
“Dai R.”: Although the main native popu-
lation of Hanuabada Moresby) is
Motuan, the sprinkling of Koitapuans are
the real owners, and their title is recog-
nised by the Motuans as occasion arises. The
Motuans came originally from the very dis-
tant west, settling first at Taurama (Pyra-
mid Point), a very barren spot, where they
eked out a dole-ish existence on wallaby and
fish. A few generations later a plague
struck the place, and the survivors moved
on to Hanuabada of the Koitapuans. A
preferential trade with right of residence for
the Motuans was arranged, and to this day
that ancient verbal agreement is honored.
The Koitapuans are very much feared by all
tribes who know them owing to their sup-
posed wonderful power over sun, rain,
Heaven and earth. Especially do the winds
belong to them, and north-west and south-
east monsoons are in their control. _ Mid-
night spirits travel at their will, and disaster
or joy results as they decide. It is fear of
these powers that has kept the Motuans from
ousting them.

“E.E.S.”: Tlie most successful fossicker
in East Gippsland in the pack-horse days
was “Red Scotty,” who had struck a rich
patch and kept it to himself very success-
fully. The story is still told of the trick
he played on two young miners who tried
to follow him unseen on his last trip into
the mountains.' Leaving Bairnsdale_ with
two horses, one loaded with provisions,
mostly flour, Scotty struck out for the
ranges. He hadn’t gone far when, glancing
back along the hillside track between the
trees, he noticed a couple of horsemen rid-
ing one behind the other. They edged off
the track and stopped when Scotty stopped;
so that was that. Taking a coupio of spare
bags from under the saddles, Scotty quickly
half-filled each with creek sand. Then, after
hiding his flour a little way off in the creek
scrub, he grasped the sand bags, well smeared
with flour, and, leaving his horses, took a
half-circle through the scrub on the opposite
side of the hill to the horsemen and came
up behind them. With the excuse that he
was going back to find his knife where he
had previously adjusted the pack, he lulled
any suspicion that he knew he was being
followed, and in the course of conversation
he agreed to let the strangers into his
secret next day, if they would camp and
mind his flour for the night at an empty
hut two miles further on, while Scotty
went back for another load. “You see,”
explained Scotty, “I mostly cart a load to
the hut and then go back for more. Next day
I pack both horses and lead them, as it’s
mostly easy going from here on. It’s safe
enough to leave it in these parts, but safer,
with someone to mind it. There’s plenty
of tea and sugar and some bread, as well
as the flour, and if you run short, lads,
don’t be afraid to cut into it.” Making-
straight back for his horses, Scotty picked
up the real flour again and, circling well
round the hut and the two strangers, con-
tinued on his journey. How long those chaps
waited at the hut was never told, but Scotty
landed back as usual in a few weeks with
a big load of the .best. He said it was the
last of it, and as he never came back it
probably was.
HEAVE AND GO!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis a long way down to Williamstown,
A long way down —hi-ho!
The sun shines red o’er the high masthead
And the dead calms hold us so.
But we’ll heave and go, My Nancy-o,
Bound for the fields of Bendigo;
We’ll heave and go, heave and go!
All squared away for Hobson’s Bay,
Now, blow, my bullies, blow!
For Paddy Doyle we’ll parch and toil
With small enough to show.
But that or not, whate’er our lot,
There’s good red gold on Bendigo ;
So heave and go, heave and go!
Come rain or shine, the girl who’s mine
Will wait for me, I know;
And fortune fair awaits us there
A-digging down below.
So heave and go, My Nancy-o,
Away for the fields of Bendigo;
Heave and go, heave and go!
One Friday morn when I was born,
Around my cot so low,
The folks did say that some bright day
To manhood’s state I’d grow.
And now I be upon the sea,
A-sailin’ to and fro.
So blow, my boys, and let us go,
Bound for the fields of Bendigo;
Heave and go, heave and go!
My bullies brave, who dare the wave,
I’d have ye all to know
That, rain or shine, the girl is mine,
Blow high the winds or low.
And lest we’re found all dead an’ drowned,
Away for the fields of Bendigo.
I’ll heave and go for Nancy-o,
I’ll heave and go, heave and go!
Come hot or cold, we’ll loose and fold,
And slice and reeve and sew;
Blow low or high, we’ll win or die,
So blow, my bullies, blow !
We’ll heave and go, my Nancy-o,
Away to the fields of Bendigo.
Heave and go ! Heave and go!
victoria.

Don’t Just wish for
w a prosperous New Year”
Do something about it!
“P
X rosperous New Year” . . . almost mechanically the words
come to your mouth.
Yet—for any dairy farmer “a prosperous New Year” can be a fact instead
of just a phrase.
The Australian dairy farmer is realising that it is not just chance that the
average production of the cows of Britain, Denmark and Holland, where
Linseed Meal is a part of the ration of every dairy herd, is over 500 gallons
per year, as against the Australian Cow’s average production of less than
300 gallons.
Test after test during the past year has shown what feeding with Meggitt’s
Linseed Oil Meal will do:
Gains in the production of herds in New South Wales and Queensland, in
Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia! Gains in the production
of herds under every kind of condition! Amazing gains that range above 60%!
And there is a ready market for a greatly increased production of Australian
butter. Of the 720,000,000 lbs butter required by Great Britain every year,
only approximately 150,000,000 lbs are supplied by Australia.
Why wait another day! Start feeding Meggitt’s immediately, a good
handful together with a good handful of bran night and morning to each
cow. You’ll see results in the milk pail within a few days.

THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
SEVEN POINTS IN JETTING.
“Liss”: If the maximum effect is to be
obtained from jetting the following points
must be carefully watched: —
(1) Make sure of the strength of the solu-
tion. For grown sheep use from 81b. to
101 b. of arsenic to lOOgal. of water; for
lambs. 51b. to 01b.; for rams’ heads, Ob.
to 81b. . . , .
(2) See that the arsenic is completely
dissolved. Use only white arsenic, boiling
it for at least 45 minutes with an equal
amount of soda ash. Boil the arsenic m
small quantities to suit the tank on the
plant, and use plenty of water.
(3) Apply the mixture as hot as seems
practicable. This helps it to penetrate the
wool and scours it to a certain extent at the
same time.
(4) Keep the pressure steady at from
1801 b. for full wools down to 1201 b. for short
wools.' „ ,
(5) See that the nozzle is of the type
that delivers a solid jet, about the size ot
No. 10 wire, and not a spray; always, use
it as close to the breech as possible.
(6) Do each sfteep carefully, going over
the whole of the area that would be shorn
if the sheep were crutched ; it is important
to go well up over the tail.
(7) Draft off all eWes already struck if
the patch is at all extensive, and treat them
in the ordinary way with a fly-oil; but do
not jet them, or they may die from poison-
ing by absorption.
WOOL COUNTS.
“Sheepo'’: Technical terms used in the
wool trade, such as 46’s and GO's, puzzle a
good many Australians, even sheepmen.
These wool counts merely denote spinning
quality. By 4G's is meant that a wool ot
that spinning quality will spin 46 hanks ot
spun yarn, each 560 yards long, to the pound
weight; 60’s will spin 60 hanks, and so on
A rough idea of counts can be obtained
from the following. Merino wool ranges
from common 60's to as high as 120’s ; Lin-
coln wool, from 32’s to 40’s. Take as an
average a 60’s spinning count for the merino
and 40’s for the Lincoln. Mating a 40 s
quality Lincoln ram with a 60’s merino ewe
will give a first-cross type witli_ wool in
the vicinity of a 50’s count. A 50’s flrst-
cross ewe mated with a 60’s merino ram will
produce a quarter-bred type, the wool a 04-
56’s. Mate a 60’s merino ram with a quarter-
bred ewe, whose count is a 54-o6 s ; result,
the comeback, whose wool will be a 58 s.
With heavy culling all these distinct types
of crosses can be bred in a uniform manner.
Ultimately, if desired, a comeback can be
obtained that will each year breed almost
true to type and spinning quality, provided,
of course, selected comeback rams are mated
with ' a uniform lot of comeback ewes, in
crossbreeding there are naturally throw-
backs both ways, and it requires a lot ot
culling to keep the flock uniform.
TAILING WEANERS.
“Spinifex”; Much of the horse-killing
work on a cattle station can be obviated
by judicious handling of cattle when they
are young. Weaners should always be kept
in hand for several weeks after they
taken from their mothers. Tailed during
the day and yarded at night they soon
become tractable; after a little while they
practically look after themselves. _ When let
out of the yard in the morning—which
should be at sunrise—they march quietly ott
to their feeding-ground, keeping well to-
gether, and then at a given time each day
they make off for their drink. After a good
camp Over the hottest part of the day out
they go for another feed, and about sun-
down they begin to wend their way towards
the yard. , , . ~
Of course they have to be taught these
habits—that is where the judicious handling
comes in. Though for the first week they
are difficult to manage, once they settle down
they give very little trouble. They get
so used to doing just what is required of
them that you don’t even have to ride along
the wing of the mob to turn the lead. That
can be done fro'm the tail, by talking to and
shouting at them, much as you would drive
a team of bullocks. It is good policy to
talk to your weaners —it soothes them and
makes them quite unafraid of you and inci-
dentally keeps their minds off mischief.
Tail your weaners and have quiet cattle.
Cattle do better and breed better when they
are contented, and the owner who handles
them in a way to make them so reaps his
reward in increased brandings and largest
percentages of fats for market.
THE BULLOCK TEAM.
“Mulyan” : On many farms and selections
the bullock team is still favored for rough
and heavy work, especially where there is
much clearing and hauling to do. The farm
team is usually a mther scraggy one—-not
infrequently including skulldraggers that aie
not worth their grass. I have seen teams
composed of steers, cows, stags and the bull
The stag and the bull are generally good
workers, and a turn in the yoke, drawing a
cask of water or a load of wood, doesn t do
Taurus any harm; but to the regular team-
ster the working of cows is anathema. He
seldom looks for a worker on a farm, and
refers contemptuously to any poor or scraggy
lot as a “cocky’s team.” ~ . ~
But often faults are as much attributable
to the driver as to the bullock itself. .Bul-
lock-driving is not as simple as driving
horses, and it is not everybody who can
become proficient at it. You will see
teamsters go up and down on dry and poorly-
grassed roads and keep their cattle in good
trim all the time. Other drivers lose part
of their strings, while the remainder are poor
and criss-crossed with, whipmarks and make
slower travelling, though they may be cross-
ing better country and with lighter loads.
Notice them also in a bog, at a sandhill or a
bad ford. One man may be stuck there tor
hours. Another man takes the whip, straight-
ens the team, and at a word or two they
reef the waggon straight out. You never
see an expert with a scraggy team. A judge
of workers in the first place, he takes them
as quietly as possible and studies their com-
fort more than he does his own. They are
as docile as pet cows, contentedly chewing
their cud while being yoked or having a spell
in the shade. Those of the incompetent on
the other hand are resentful and sulky.
They fret under harsh treatment, and thus
do badly even where the feed is good, lhe
teams show plainly the sort of drivers they
have by their looks and actions.
Bullocks vary a lot according to- breed,
and, in the opinion of many drivers, accord-
ing to color. A white bullock, for instance,
is very seldom seen in a team. Neither is
yellow favored, though brindles are common,
Light and dark roans and spotted bullocks
seem to be the most liked. These are gener-
ally Durhams or Shorthorn strain —hardy,
reliable workers. I have never met a whole
team of Herefords (baldies) on the road,
nor a team of Devons (reds), though I have
seen them on stations where those cattle were
bred. The Devon is timid and fretful; the
Hereford looks well in condition but lacks
stamina. Some drivers aim at a team of
uniform color, not infrequently sacrificing
strength for appearance. The average driver
looks for weight and the powerful quarters
and neck that mean pulling-power. He
doesn’t want lanky legs nor a lazy beast.
Many bullocks belie their looks, and have
to be worked to discover their true worth.
Some with aggravating characteristics are
best cast out of the team before they spoil
those they have to be yoked to. . Others
tongue quickly, but, before condemning these,
make sure that the fault is not in the bow.
While some bullocks work comfortably 'in
round bows, others have to be fitted with
pipe bows.
When breaking in young bullocks, don t
couple them with good, everyday workers;
either let the novices run in pairs or couple
them with old bullocks that have reached the
pension stage.
POSSIBILITIES OF THE BRAHMAN
CROSS.
“Beefo”: Experiments made at Lake’s
Creek (C.Q.) meatworks with Brahman-
cross beef have shown that cattlemen in
tick-infested areas might with advantage
import Zebu bulls from India to cross with
Shorthorn and Hereford cows. The history
of tho introduction, of Zebu bulls dates back
nearly 30 years, when the owners of Christ-
mas Creek station (N.Q.) bought two Zebu
bulls from, Melbourne Zoo. A few bull
calves by the two Zebus out of Shorthorn
cows were kept. A shipment recently made
from Lake’s Creek to Smithfield was from
bullocks of the Brahman cross, and sale
results were better than for ordinary Queens-
land beef.
Apart from beef possibilities, these Brah-
man cross cattle are disease-resisters. Ticks
do not worry them, so dipping is not
required. And none of the Brahman bul-
locks killed showed any signs of pleuro or
tuberculosis, nor was any of them subject
to nodules to the same extent as cattle of
other breeds. The cattle are hardy, and
easily worked; where other breeds fall away
and die during drought periods, the Brah-
man cross cattle more than hold their own.
Beak Bros, are enthusiastic about the pos-
sibilities of the breed; it was from their
cattle of the Brahman-cross breed that the
successful shipment from Lake’s Creek was
made. Another lot is to be sent to Britain
shortly.
HORSES AT THE SHOW.
“Bar K.”: Farmers everywhere this
season have been sending their mares to
stallions; unfortunately the quality of the
stallion usually leaves much to be desired.
Good suggestions for improving the quality
of our horses have appeared in The Bul-
letin. My idea is that more use should
be made by breeders of the opportunities
afforded at shows, large and small; and
that these opportunities in some cases could
with advantage be increased.
In the show-ring there could be nothing
more attractive than the sight of a first-
class sire with several of his progeny and
their mothers. This section gives the sire
the opportunity to exhibit his most valuable
point, the ability to reproduce his own type,
with improvements through judicious cross-
ing with a good mare. At the Brisbane
Exhibition there is a class for a sire and two
of his progeny, another for a dam and two
of her progeny (draughts). In Victoria
there is a class for three yearlings by the
same sire, any owner.
At the present time it is doubtful if
entries would warrant the inclusion of such
a class at the Sydney Show. Still, with the
stimulation offered to horse-breeding, it is a
good time for owners of good Clydesdales to
look ahead and organise for the forming of
such family groups. If the entries were
available the breeders could rely on being
catered for in the prize schedule.
TRENCH SILOS.
“Mulgo”: The simplest and most con-
venient silo for the small dairyman is the
trench style. This can be made into a bank
or on a slight slope, to ensure drainage. A
trench is cut about 30ft. long, Bft. deep,
12ft. wide at the top and Bft. at the bottom.
Sides, bottom and one end are covered with
wire-netting, and that with 3in. of concrete,
which makes it a permanent structure. The
lower end is left open, so that a cart can
be backed in. Sides should be banked a
little above the ground level to keep out
surface water. A roof is merely a matter
of a few poles and any suitable covering.
Though conveniences may be provided so
that stuff can be pitched in anywhere, it is
just as easy to back in with it as to cart
out the silage.
If the trench silo is made on the brow. of
a narrow hill, the whole of the excavating
can be done with a plough and a scoop, and
both ends may be sloped, so that a cart may
be backed in either way.
Any handy farmer can make this silo for
himself. The dimensions may be more or
less than those given, according to require-
ments. The composition of the concrete
for the walls and floor should be three parts
sand, two parts gravel and one part cement;
or one part cement to four parts sand. Put
on in the ordinary way with a trowel, forms
being unnecessary, and tamp well in through
the netting. Smooth the concrete surface
with wet cement before it dries.
In well-drained situations, such as a hill,
and where the subsoil does not hold water,
the bottom of the silo may be floored with
bricks or slabs, the latter on two sleepers,
one sunk alongside each cement wall. The
slabs cheapen and lessen the work of con-
struction, but they should fit properly and
have a smooth, level surface.
BLUE MOULD IN W.A.
A settler in Manjimup, South Westralia,
where excellent cigarette tobacco has been
produced, tried an original device for pre-
venting blue mould. His idea was to raise
seedlings in the wheat belt, hundreds of
miles from Manjimup and other tobacco
districts; and this he did on a rather big-
scale, sending the seedlings to Manjimup
by rail. Unfortunately the ingenious notion
worked out badly.
Blue mould broke out in the district, and
it was shown to have originated in these
very seedlings from the wheat belt. In
those parts a native tobacco-plant (Nicotiana
sauveolens ) grows on sandy soil over a very
wide area of country in the neighborhood of
granite outcrops. It is naturally infected
with blue mould, and the disease spread from
the wild tobacco to the cultivated plants
in the seed beds. Large consignments of
infected seedlings had been sent to Man-
jimup district before the mischief was dis-
covered.
So tobacco-planters in the South-West have
been industriously spraying their seed-beds
with a 3-5-50 Bordeaux mixture and reduc-
ing watering to a minimum. This was the
advice given by Government Plant Patholo-
gist Pittman, who also said in effect: “Trans-
plant your seedlings into the field as soon
as possible. Blue mould is of little conse-
quence once the seedlings are planted out.
It is essentially a seed-bed trouble, being
favored in the seed-bed by unnatural crowding
of the plants and the somewhat artificial
conditions under which they are grown
while in that stage.”
SAWING FARM TIMBER.
•‘Bert the Carpenter”: Any farmer who
has a table-top firewood saw-bench can saw
his own building timber —it is understood
that straight-barrelled and .suitable trees
are growing near by. F'irst make sure that
the bench top is perfectly level; then sink
two pairs of posts, 2ft. apart, into the
ground on either side, the first pair 3ft.
from the edge of the bench, the second
Bft. Their centre is on a line with the
saw, and slots are cut in their tops, into
which are laid rollers made from pieces
of 2in. water-pipe. Each of these rollers
must be exactly horizontal, a quarter of an
inch higher than the level of the bench top.
The roller nearest to the front of the saw
is fitted with a handle like a grindstone.
When all has been tested and found accurate,
nail cross-braces on posts to keep them
from being pushed out of shape.
Get a thick saw of eight, nine or ten
gauge, with ripping teeth, three feet in dia-
meter. Gut-down ones can be bought
cheaply from city timber mills. Next you
wall require a cradle —a 14ft. length of
Oregon, not less than lOin. wide by 2in.
thick, and free from twist. Cut a couple
of dozen little wedges from hardwood and
you are ready to begin. A log 10ft. long by
a foot in diameter is the right size to prac-
tise on. Place cradle on rollers in front of
saw, lay log so that it hangs 2in. over
saw side of cradle, and chock by pushing the
little wedges in between log and cradle
right along both sides. If there is a bend
in the log, place the curve upward. Cradle
is guided straight by means of two wooden,
pins stood in holes bored in the bench top.
Start the saw going. The man in charge
stands at back of cradle to guide it; an
assistant takes the crank on the leading
roller and turns gently to pass log over saw;
tbe tailer-out stands at the back of the
saw with a slender wedge and a mallet.
When the log reaches the edge of the
bench, and not before, he taps in the wedge
to keep the kerf open and helps to pull for
the rest of the way.
Never try to' take a big cut for the first
one; if you merely leave a flat surface sin.
or 6in. wide along the log it is all you
need. Switch off saw, discard cradle, push
log back, turn on flat side and take second
cut —this time a full one. Then roll on
this again and cut the rest of the log into
slabs of the width required, afterwards re-
sawing these into the needed thicknesses.
There is no need for proper fences on- the
bench —woo'den pins fitting tightly into
holes in the bench top will serve quite well.
Things to avoid are having the saw run-
ning too fast and having the pull on the
belt the wrong way. The strain should
always be underneath. As to timber, our
ordinary native pine, if you can get big
enough logs, is splendid—white-ant proof,
quick to season and easy to fix. But the
bush in some districts is full of useful
hardwoods. The rules for seasoning are
the same everywhere; stack the stuff up on
dunnage clear of the ground, leave spaces
between each piece, place a few bits of scant-
lings between each layer and put heavy
weights on top to keep the stuff from warp-
ing. Rain and wind assist the seasoning
process; direct sunlight is to be avoided.
BAG-FILLERS.
“Mulyan”: A one-man bag-filler is neces-
sary in all barns where chaff, maize or other
produce has to be bagged. The handiest
filler is a wooden frame, an inch or two
less than the height of the bag when stood
on the floor, made with four by 24in.
posts and two or three 2in. by lin. battens on
each of three sides. The front has a batten
only at the top, the rest being open so that
the bag can be drawn out when filled. A blunt-
pointed nail in the centre of each of the
top battens holds the bag in position. Being-
light, this filler can be picked up and car-
ried to any place required.
Another kind may be made in a few
minutes with an old cream-can. Cut off
a few inches of the bottom, leaving a V-
shaped piece at one side, with a hole in
the centre of it, to hang to a wall or rail,
and so that the mouth of the can is down-
ward. The bag is held by a couple of small
wire hooks on the handles of the can. This
may be used anywhere, in field or barn; in
the open it can be hung to a tree or fence
or to the back of the cart.
SPECIALISATION IN POULTRY-
FARMING.
“Jack Point”: There is a lot to be said
in favor of the specialisation methods fol-
lowed by American poultry-farmers. In
Australia the poultry-farmer generally does

everything from chicken to chicken —rearing,
fattening and marketing of cockerels, cull-
ing, care of pullets, mating of breeding-
pens and hatching. In the U.S.A. hatching
is mostly done by business concerns which
don’t own a hen, but buy eggs from farms
under constant supervision by inspectors to
ensure quality. Millions of chicks are sold
direct from the incubators to men who make
a specialty of rearing them to eight weeks
old; at that age the pullets are sold to
egg-farmers, pure and simple, who' concen-
trate on .this side of the business, others
buying the cockerels and caponising, fatten-
ing and marketing.
Though poultry-farming is not hard work,
it is tedious when there are so many different
tasks to attend to. When we are up to
the neck in hatching eggs and rearing
chicks the layers are frequently neglected a
bit; whilst if we give the latter the care
desirable, something else is liable to be over-
looked. Again, there are certain tasks which
we can interest ourselves in much more than
in others—for instance, the man who can
rear chicks to maturity with the minimum
of loss is not always successful in coaxing
the pullets to give their maximum produc-
tion.
I don’t advocate the wholesale adoption of
Yankee methods, but there is plenty of
room for improvement in many phases of
our poultry industry. Already much pro-
gress has been made towards eliminating the
use of small incubators in favor of mammoth
machines co-operatively owned, thus reliev-
ing small poultrymen of hatching troubles.
A co-operative rearing farm which would
spare the farmer sleepless nights thinking
about coccidiosis, white diarrhoea, etc., would
be a boon as well as an economic success
by diminishing chick mortality.

sowing, harrow in superphosphate at the
rate of lewt. per acre. (2) Eight to
121 b. per acre. (3) It is a valuable fodder.
Japanese is the best variety.
How to remove from a horse's eye the
scum caused through cattle-blight? —72o6.
Apply lotion of sulphate of zinc 1 part,
boiled water 40 parts. Two or three appli-
cations at intervals of a few days are
usually sufficient to check the disease in an
early stage. In old animals, daily or twice-
daily applications are essential. Also an
ointment, yellow oxide of mercury 1 part
and vaseline 9 parts, should be applied to
the upper or lower eyelids each day after
the use of the lotion.
Recipe for a preparation to preserve
horses’ hoofs? —7142.
Heat up beef fat and then pour in Stock-
holm tar and raw linseed oil, about equal
parts of each.
(1) Can yams and sweet potatoes be de-
hydrated? (2) Probable cost of plant to
treat 50 to 100 tons a year, and where
obtainable? —7053.
(1) It is doubtful whether yams would
be a success in dehydrated form, owing to
excessive fibre. Sweet potatoes would in
some instances suffer from the same dis-
ability. Some varieties are less fibrous than
others, and cognisance should be given to
this fact. (2) The Clyde Engineering Co.
manufactures a dehydration plant known as
the “Simplex” drier. No. 2, 40 trays, having
a capacity of 14 bushels of apples per day,
costs £75. The largest machine, No. 3, is
equal to 70 bushels of apples per day, and
costs £220.
(1) Suitable soils for sweet corn, and
does the soil need to be well fertilised? (2)
When, and how, should sweet corn be
planted in the County of Cumberland
(N.S.W.) ? (3) Does it need much looking
after while growing? (4) When to har-
vest? —7203.
(1)A rich soil, well supplied with organic
matter and humus, is required. For fer-
tiliser use stable manure supplemented by
lewt. to 2cwt. of super, to the acre. A
top-dressing of to fewt. of nitrate of
soda about six weeks after planting will
hasten growth, especially where nitrogen, is
deficient in the soil. (2) Commence towards
the end of September and put in successive
plantings every three weeks. Three rows
.should be sown at a time. Sow the corn in
“hills,” 36in. or 42in. apart each way, setting
six grains per hill and thinning out to two
or three plants per hill when they have
attained a height of 6in. or Bin. (3) The
cultivator should be kept going between
the rows, but this cultivation should never
be deeper than three inches, especially when
the plants are well up, otherwise roots will
be destroyed. The removal of the suckers
should be left until flowering has finished.
(4) Harvest when the grains are in full
milk and just about to turn to dough. Out-
side indications of ripeness are that the ear
is plump, the silk changing from brown
to black in color, and the tassel brown, or
changing from brown to white. As sweet
corn rapidly loses its flavor after picking,
especially in hot weather, leave the har-
vesting until as late as possible before mar-
keting, cooking or canning.
(1) Can poultry be salted and smoked
successfully? (2) Would the quality of the
birds for eating- be much impaired? —7o29.
. (1) No, on account of the toughening of
tissues inseparable from the process. (2)
Yes.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Karaway”: Pumpkins are a good food
for dairy cows as well as for pigs. But
they should be chopped up in small pieces, as
cows are liable to get lumps stuck in the
throat. The seeds, which contain much
nutriment, should not be wasted. There
is an old belief that they tend to dry the
cows, and on that account some farmers
remove them. Tests have shown that the
idea is wrong; have shown * also that raw
pumpkins are better than boiled for pigs
and that the seeds free them of worms.
“Dimon”: Discarded cream-cans may be
put to many uses. Laid on the side on two
small pieces of round timber, slightly hol-
lowed _to fit, a can makes a good nest for
a sitting hen, or one with young chickens.
If it is necessary to shut them in at night,
perforate the lid and slit it on. It is also
convenient for holding salt in the meat-
house, chicken feed and storing grain. If
the bottom is worn out, fit in a wooden one.
With the neck cut off the can makes a
flowerpot or a garbage-tin. It can also be
converted into a bucket for picking up
potatoes and so forth.
“Sheepo”: If you decide those heavy
daggy locks are not worth sending away for
sale, clip off the dags with hand shears. A
little short wool can be salvaged from each
daggy lock, and even at prevailing rates
the return will justify the time spent in
clipping.
“Booraby”: I saw a primitive but handy
contrivance at a selector’s house in the
north-western corner of N. S. Wales. The
nearest waterhole was three miles away, but
still the place had “water laid on.” Sup-
plies were carted in a square iron tank, and
the dray was backed under a bough-shed
behind the living-room. An iron pipe passed
through the wall and was screwed on to a
straight tap in the tank; an ordinary tap
was screwed on to the other end of the
pipe. Thus the inmates had all the water
they wanted without having to go outside
for it.
“Dunboy”: It is often necessary to sub-
divide a paddock part of which is cropped
for grazing purposes. A stock-proof fence
that should last 12 months can be made
with a few posts, stakes, haybands and wire.
Erect posts 40 yards apart, with a strainer
every 10 chains. Bore them and run your
wires, making the top wire a barb; strain
and place stakes every eight yards—-mallee
saplings make good ones. Secure wires to
stakes with haybands. The fence should be
at least half a chain back from the crop.
“Beady”: Pinkeye in sheep is prevalent in
parts of N.S.W.; being caused mostly
through grass seed. When riding round the
paddocks carry an ordinary pair of forceps
and a sewing-machine oilcan filled with eye
lotion. The lotion will relieve an affected
sheep wherever found.
“Pine Scrub”: Any but a suburban cattle-
man will be with “Beefo” (B. 2/12/’3l) in
his remarks on “J.K.J.’s” branding methods,
but blotching can be practically eliminated
by the use of the calf-branding crush. This
contrivance is shaped to hold the calf in
front of the shoulders and along ribs, battens
being placed at intervals which allow of work
with knife and iron. The side furthest from
the operator is held fast by a catch, the
near side working on a curved ratchet at
top so as to open to admit calf and allow of
closing quickly to hold it. Calf caught, the
whole crush is lowered on a bolt-hinge fast-
ened at ground level and the calf is held
ready for business —no rush; no slapdash
work required. The crush is then raised,
partly by hand-lift, but principally by a
weighted rope running from crush through
a pulley fastened above the crush to a post,
and the calf released. The crush is fed
from a race and after a little practice a
calf is rarely missed on its dash for the
open yard.
“Nyah”: Other weeds besides those cited
as “noxious” can give trouble to cockies.
For example, chicory, which is spreading in
some of the irrigation areas along the Yic.
side of the Murray. If allowed to become
established it will do in a lucerne patch.
From now onwards is the best time to get
rid of it; its blue flowers are conspicuous.
Small plants can often be pulled up when
the ground is damp; of the larger ones get
as much of the long tap-root as possible.
Noxious weeds of any kind should always
be burned —cutting them off and leaving on
the ground is waste of time.
“Notwen”: A fruit cocky of my acquaint-
ance makes a profitable side-line out of the
wild pigs which abound along the Murray
swamps. He catches a few litters, fattens
them on skim-milk, etc., from the farm,
and after a few weeks sells them in the
nearest market; average profit, 10s. per pig.
The one thing to remember is that Grunter
must be got very young; otherwise, the
flesh will taste strong.
“Beta”: Somebody has been asking how
to grow watercress. I bought a bunch, cut
the tops off, and put the stalks in the ground
where they have plenty of water —alongside
a drain from the roof of a shed. I have to
chop it out pretty often.
“Bert the Carpenter”: To drive nails into
hardwood try this. Make a steel punch with
a sharp point, tap this in for about a quar-
ter of an inch where the nail is to go, pull
out again, push the point of the nail into a
piece of soap which has been soaked to make
it soft and moist, and do not try to drive
it in too fast at the start. In the case of
very hard stuff like red-gum it is sometimes
necessary, before inserting the nail, to fill
the hole made by the punch with soap.
“J.5.8.”:-To prevent breakages in wooden
binder pitmen, try this simple remedy. Remove
the cotter-pin or nut a t the knife end and
take off steel washer, cut a leather one and
put it on, then replace steel washer against it
and insert pin. If there is not enough room
for leather washer rasp the pitman away
a little. Should the end of a much-worn
pitman pull out, get a piece of hoopiron
about a foot long and bend into a hairpin
shape so as to fit over the broken end.
Cut away the forked sides carefully so as to
allow the iron to form the missing part of the
original hole. Mark where the holes are to
be in hoopiron and wood, remove and drill
or punch. Fasten with rivets or bolts;
quarter-inch tyre-bolts are ideal.
“Kathiawar”: Australian breeders of
Clydesdales have been gladdened by what
may be the opening of a new and profitable
market. The 8.1. liner Querimba included in
her freight of 700 Australian remounts for
the Indian army a three-year-old Clydesdale
stallion, bred in Victoria by A. Stokes, of
Abbotsford. Nowadays the Indian army
breeds draught types for heavy gun anil
transport work that was once done by bul-
locks. The Clydesdale is the strain most in
request for sires, and so far these have been
imported from Britain. The Victorian nag
is the first Australian of his breed to go to
India, and it may be that he will be the
forerunner of many.

THE NEW HOME
The front and northern side of the new home. The tower stands
midway in the building between George-street and Hamilton-
street. The total depth is over 300ft.
FIA’E times now in its 52 years The
Bulletin has grown out ot ns brick-
aud-mortar clothes. Thrice in its first
dozen years it had to seek a new suit; the
fourth time, in George-street North, it was
able to add frills and flounces and a few
gussets. But the time came when, largely owing
to the phenomenal growth of the "AAffiman’s
Mirror,” it was too tight a fit altogether,
and the long search for another complete suit
had to be undertaken. The misfortunes of
Keep, Macpherson, Ltd., which had suc-
ceeded the very old-established house of
Holdsworth, Macpherson and Co., furnished
the opportunity for which the Bulletin
Newspaper Co. had been seeking. A home
still in George-street North, but nearer the
business heart of the city, was on the market;
and The Bulletin and family secured it.
What had been wanted was a home in
which its people could work in comfort;
where it could make its productions a little
bit better than ever; and -where there was
room to grow almost indefinitely. It wanted
light and air: it did not want its machinists
to work in a gloomy basement, or us photo-
graphers and etchers and linotype-operators
to grill under a glass roof in the summer.
The new premises were capable of being trans-
formed to answer all these requirements.
They had a frontage of between 40ft. and
50ft. to George-street; they had a depth of
over 300 ft. to Hamilton-street; they had
Bridge-lane on the north and Abercrombie-
lane on the south. Except for 60ft. on the
north they were an island block, with light
and air all around ; and they had seven floors,
with a basement and a sub-basement for
paper, ink and other stores. They were
equipped with three electric lifts, for pas-
sengers and goods; they had a sprinkler
installation throughout, cutting down to
almost nothing the risk of extensive lire;
and they were as substantially built as any
place in the Southern Hemisphere.
The land which they occupied was among
the very early grants made in the new settle-
ment on Port Jackson. It ran back, accord-
ing to an old description, to a stone wall on
the bank of the Tank Stream; and at one
time it was in the possession of John Tawell,
the first influential Quaker in Australia—
the man who, having acquired some hundreds
of gallons of rum in a business deal, no
other payment being available to complete
the transaction, had that part of the cur-
rency of the period poured into the harbor.
After that, it is not so pleasant to record,
he returned to England, and was hanged for
a murder; in connection with his arrest it
is recorded that the electric telegraph, which
had just been invented, was for the first
time made use of by the police. Later on
the property fell into the hands of Captain
Sylvester lirownc, who w T as the father of
tliat T. A. Browne, who wrote “Robbery
Under Arms” and many another good story
of the wild days of the bushrangers. A
very interesting history has the ground on
which The Bulletin’s new home was many
years later reared by Holdsworth Macphcr-
sons, who them-
selves had been
in business in
Sydney, under
varying names,
since 1625.
The premises
secured, the
next step was
to remodel them
to serve their
new purpose.
With that end
in view Mr.
Oscar Beattie,
who had been
the architect of
the very fine
buildings put up
by the Presby-
terian Church
on Church Hill,
was called in.
Later on he
was associated,
as contractors,
with Beat
Brothers, who
had been the
contractors also
for the Church
Hill pile.
The fi r s t
question to be
decided was
what should be
done with the
Hoe rotary and
other printing-
presses with
whi c h The
Bulletin,
"AY Oman’s
Mirror” and
“ ‘AVild Cat’
Monthly” are
produced.
Should they be
housed in a
basement or on
the ground
floor? To give
abundant head-
room it was de-
cided to instal
the three rotary
presses on the
ground floor, at
the George-
street end, and
the semi-rotary
and smaller
presses in the
basement, which,
owing to the fall
in the ground,
becomes the
ground floor on
Bridge-lane. That involved establishing the
general offices on the first floor. This magni-
ficent room, to be known henceforward as the
Archibald Gallery, is 150 ft. long, with a height
of 17ft. Here, in addition to the general offices,
a gallery is being established in which will be
displayed over 500 of the greatest black-and-
white drawings made for The Bulletin dur-
ing the past 50 years. Every black-and-white
artist whose name was familiar to former
generations of readers of The Bulletin
will be represented—“ Hop,” Phil May. Low,
Lambert, AJf Vincent, AVill Dyson, Percy
F. S. Spence—besides the men whose work
is familiar to the present generation: Norman
Lindsay, Scorfield, Leason, Percival, Souter,
Minns, the Patersons, Oswald Pryor, Bertha
Bennet Burleigh, AAffiite and a dozen others.
This gallery, which will hold the most unique
collection of black and white ever brought
together, will be open to the public at all
times during business hours ; and the public
is cordially invited to come and wander
among the treasures. The collection includes
also a portrait in oils, by Longstaff, of J F
Archibald, one of the founders of The Bul-
letin ; another of James Edmond, for many
years the editor of the paper, by AVilliam
Macleod—these two from the collection of
Mrs. AY ill ia m
Macleod, by whom
they are lent. A
third portrait, by
Monteitli, is of
AVilliam Macleod,
for 40 years the
managing direc-
tor of the com-
pany and its art
editor for most of
that period. There
are also a series
of abo. studies in
water-colors by
Minns, the master
of that branch of
Australian art,
which will attract
much attention.
This gallery,
which will be
opened early in
the new year, is
reached from
George-street by
a stairway from
the main hall,
where also, for
those who prefer
it. a lift is pro-
vided. This main
hall and the easy
stairway are in
polished maple,
with carved wara-
tah decorations.
In this hall, on
the George-street
ground level, is
also an office for
inquiries, the sale of papers and the
delivery of “AVoman’s Mirror” patterns. This
inquiry counter is connected by Dictograph
telephone with every department of the office.
The object kept in view throughout has
been to make the production of the papers
a continuous process. The literary staffs
occupy all the mezzanine floor, which
has a depth of 150 ft., and is reached from
the Archibald Gallery. Immediately below
this is the composing-room, where the lino-
types are installed. “Copy” passes from the
editorial rooms down to the linotypes ; the
proof-readers are housed alongside. From
there the matter in type passes to the stereo
department, where solid page plates are cast
from this type. These plates, which have
to be curved in order to fit on to the rotary
presses, pass on another step to the press-
room. There the actual printing is done.
The printed sheets pass by conveyors down
to the publishing-room underneath, where
they are presently parcelled for dispatch,
five cart docks making quick dispatch an easy
matter. Meantime the illustrations have to
be dealt with. These are made into blocks by
the etchers, who are housed on the floor above
the editorial rooms, and the blocks are sent
down to the composing-room, to be incorpor-
ated into the pages of type before being sent
on to the stereo department, as before
described.
The ground floor was carried on ironbark
girders supported by ironbark pillars, with
steel ties. To secure perfect rigidity, and
ensure complete absence of vibration in the
rotary presses, this floor was reinforced with
steel H-girders, bedded in concrete. The
140 ft. of length available on the northern
side was just sufficient to house the three
Hoe presses ; the southern side, temporarily
occupied by folding-machines, is in reserve
for more presses as circumstances require.
Nearest George-street, and visible behind
plate-glass windows, is the machine which
works all the weeks round producing the
“Woman’s Mirror.” This press, 28ft. long
and 9fG 6in. wide, turns out a complete
64-page “Mirror.” The paper, in reels of
lOcwt., is fed in at one end ; at the other it
emerges printed, folded, the colored cover
added and the whole stitched together. From
the moment the paper out of which a
“Mirror” will be made enters the machine
at one end until it emerges a complete maga-
zine at the other, about 28 seconds elapse in
practice; in tests it is possible to reduce
this by 10 seconds. Of course many
“Mirrors” are on the machine at the one
time, in different stages of creation. The only
thing this almost human machine does not do
is to print the colored covers ; these, printed
on special machines, are stacked alongside,
where it can pick them up, adjust them, tuck
them around the printed pages and carry
them on to the stitching apparatus. It cap
do no more for them then except to send
them down to the publishing floor on a con-
tinuous conveyor. There all that remains
to be done is to trim the edges in a j>'iant
cutter, whose base alone weighs three tons.
There used to be times when, owing pos-
sibly to some quality in the atmosphere, the
paper, tightly stretched as it passed from
one steel roller to another, snapped, and the
ends flew apart. A certain quantity of static
electricity had somehow got into the paper.
Nowadays, as in all three rotary machines,
the current is led off by an ingenious device
known as the Chapman Neutraliser, which
generates 10,000 volts alternating current
and absorbs all this static electricity, and the
old difficulty of operating fast presses to do
good printing has been thus overcome.
Much attention has also been given of
recent years to the problem of “offsetting.”
Printers’ ink is a viscous material, of the
consistency of thin treacle, and no matter
how carefully the flow may be regulated (a
matter chiefly of temperature) it is impos-
sible to get to the last fraction the absolutelv
right quantity of ink on every sheet and
every square inch of every sheet. If it were
possible to allow the sheet to be exposed to
the air for a few minutes, any surplus ink
might dry ; actually, however, within a second
or so of the moment the ink is applied, two
printed pages are brought together, face to
face, under considerable pressure. In such
circumstances the slightest excess of ink any-
where will blur the opposite page. Until
a very few years ago it was not believed pos-
sible "to make and operate a machine that
would print on both sides of the paper in
one operation; still less that paper thus
printed could be instantly brought face to
face with another newly printed page. But
increasing circulations drove the great print-
ing-press makers of the world to develop
contrivances for overcoming this bugbear;
and in the later presses made by the old Eng-
lish firm of Hoe—now also with great works
in New York —the difficulty has been almost
completely overcome. H'oes have built to the
order of the Bulletin Newspaper Co. three
rotary presses during the past nine years-
the last was installed in 1929 —and each suc-
ceeding one shows improvements in some
particular upon its predecessor. The first
was built under the supervision of The
Bulletin’s superintending engineer, Mr.
George Bombelli, who it is pleasant to recall
now was trained on the premises. The
machines embody the main principles of
those engaged in the production of the
“Saturday Evening Post,” America’s great-
est weekly, and The Bulletin is under an
obligation to Messrs. Curtis Brothers, the
proprietors of that paper, for their advice
and assistance in the designing of these
presses.
Behind the “Mirror” press are two others
of the' same general character, one devoted
to the production of The Bulletin, the
other capable of producing either The Bul-
letin or the “Woman’s Mirror.' These
presses do not, however, carry the process
quite as far as the other; one of them
delivers the sheets flat, and thus enables a
slightly surer job to be made of the printing
of The Bulletin’s finer illustrations. The
flat sheets from these presses are put through
automatic folding machines, made to this
paper’s designs, folding 32 pages at one
operation. The cover is attached on stitch-
ing-machincs, each handling 4000 papers an
hour.
But a great deal has had to be done before
the press-room is reached; that, in fact, if
more spectacular than some of the others,
is towards the end of the march. The trouble
begins, of course, in the literary quarters,
on the mezzanine floor, which has the etchers
(who put the illustrations into metal) above
them and the compositors and the stereo-
typers beneath them. With the help of
linotype machines, the compositors put the
written matter first into lines of type, and
then into pages; the stereotypers make the
pages into solid plates of metal, from which
the actual printing is done.
The linotype is another of the, almost-
human machines of the printing office. Down
to about 40 years ago the compositor stood
behind his “case,” divided into little compart-
ments, each devoted to a letter or a stop,
each symbol cast in relief at one end of a
tiny cube of metal; and thus piece by piece
he built up his words and sentences, placing
the cubes as he picked them out with the
right hand into a holder he called a “stick,”
which he held in the left hand. When the
sheet was printed the tiny cubes had to be
returned one by one to their proper compart-
ment in the case. To-day the operator sits
behind a keyboard; he touches a key, repre-
senting a letter or a stop, a matrix drops
into its place, he touches another and another
until he has completed a line, then he pulls
a lever which releases a flow of molten metal;
a line of type is thus cast; and the matrices
return each to its own particular channel
in the magazine, ready for their next turn;
and so he goes on his way. He was a good
compositor in the hand-setting days wffio
could set up 2000 letters in an hour • 18,000
have been done on the linotype. And then the
hand-setter had to distribute his type. To-day
he distributes his “matter” by the simple pro-
cess of dropping it into the melting-pot, to
be used again and again. There are men in
The Bulletin composing-room who remem-
ber the hand-setting days: Tom Reynolds,
The machine-room, which, on this northern side, houses the three Hoe rotary presses. A central window looking
into George-street on the ground level is shown in the distance.


for instance, at present the office’s oldest
inhabitant, with a record of 49 years service.
But the linotype has its disadvantages. In
the old days, if a letter was discovered by
the proof-reader to be wrong, only one cube
had to be picked out and another inserted
in its place. To-day the whole line has to
be re-set; and in the re-setting it is possible
for another error to be made. And then
there are larger “marks” than the correc-
tion of a single letter. Editors, who see much
of the matter for the first time when it is m

of re-casting sentences, or scoring out adjec-
tives which may involve the re-setting of

there will be none until a page-proof has
been presented, which is absolutely “clean.
The Bulletin and its associated papers are
proud of their comparative freedom from
“literals”; but to" secure even that compara-
tive freedom as many as a dozen “proofs”
and “revises” are “pulled” and scrutinised.
Up in the etchers’ department some inter-
esting work has been going on all this time.
A selection of drawings has been made in the
literary-and-art quarters for the coming
week, some in line, some in wash, and the
size which each one is required to be and
the page which it is to occupy marked
upon it. A giant camera, occupying 17ft. by
4ft. Gin. of floor space, makes a negative of
the required size—to look at, much the same
as an ordinary photographic plate. This is
printed on to zinc (or for highest quality
work, copper) and by various processes of
acid-etching, in which the artistic skill of
the etcher plays a big part, the surface of
the zinc is eaten away, leaving in relief a
replica of the original drawing or photo-
graph. Newspaper blocks are of two classes
—line, for the reproduction of pen-and-ink
drawings, and half-tone, for photographs or
wash drawings. The latter are. made up of
a series of small dots —pin-point dots for
the whites, or high-lights, heavier ones for
the middle tones, to a flat dot for the darker
portions of the picture. The better the
quality of the paper the finer the screen
that may be used —that is, the smaller and
closer together these dots, and consequently

the more detail in the reproduction. The
average daily paper uses a 55 to 60 screen;
The Bulletin 100 —that i.s, to each square
inch there are 100 dots across and 100 down,
or 10,000 to the square inch.
The stereotyping department, the step in
between the comps and the printing
machines, is the warm corner of the office.
There from the flat formes of type locked
up by the comps, a papier-mache impression
is taken, the flong, as the papier mticlie is
called, being first beaten into the forme with
brushes and afterwards baked while under
a tremendous pressure in an electrically-
heated press. The flong, with the impression
of the type and blocks, having been baked
hard, is put into the casting-box, into wlncli
molten metal, composed of 80 p.c. lead,
15 p.c. antimony and 5 p.c. tin, is poured,
and allowed to cool off to form the curved
plate, later to be clamped to the printing
cylinders. But this metal, though apparently
hard, is not hard enough to stand the long
runs to which it must be subjected. 8o
before the machine-room can handle it, the
plate is given an hour’s nickelling, and the
nickel-plating stands up to all the strain that
is put on it during, in the case of the
“Mirror,” its full week’s run.
The “Mirror” pattern, department is one
that has grown to very large proportions
during its seven years of life. The average
output of free patterns each week is 12,000,
and one sometimes wonders what would
happen if 12,000 women, each with a dress
cut from the same pattern, were to meet.
Some weeks 16,000 patterns have been sent
out. The free patterns, though chit on a
band-saw 500 at a time, are all f°hjed
separately by hand —a tremendous job. The
output of other patterns very frequently
runs to .3000 per week. These, on account
of the varying numbers and different sizes,
are cut by hand. As mothers no doubt
suspect, by far the “best seller” in patterns
is the one of a small boy’s pair of pants.
Above the floors now occupied there are
four floors over 300 ft. long, and, highest
of all, an apartment 150 ft. long, over the
lighting of which every artist who lias seen
it has been almost lyrical. This hall, to be
known as the Macleod Gallery when it lias
been reconditioned, will, there is every
reason to believe, be the art centre of Syd-
ney, at which many future picture exhibi-
tions will be held. Mr. Victor Mann, the
National Gallery's late director, declares
that that institu-
tion can offer
nothing like the
Macleod Gallery
for natural light-
ing.
It will be
many years be-
fore the unoccu-
pied floors will
be required for
The Bulletin’s
own work; and
meantime they
will be occupied
by approved
tenants. Inci-
dentally the first,
tenants in the
new Bulletin
Building were
the Boy Scouts,
who have estab-
lished the head-
quarters of their
organisation on
part of the fifth
floor.
Under the base-
ment (which is
the ground floor
in Bridge-lane,
where the dis-
patch docks are)
there is a sub-
basement 250 ft.
in length. Here
the reels of news-
print are stored;
they are lowered
by electric lift and
brought up alongside the presses by an
electric hoist. Notwithstanding that, owing
to the general business depression, the
number of advertising pages lias been very
seriously reduced, approximately Ido tons
of paper will be consumed during the current
month, and 1 ton scwt. of ink.
In various sections of the building are. inter -
esting little departments which dovetail into
the general scheme. On the dispatch floor
are the racks which hold, each in its own
small compartment, the printed labels to be
glued to the parcels of the 4100 agents sup-
plied direct from head office ; and many thou-
sands of other agents are supplied through the.
Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth
branch offices and through Messrs. Gordon
and Gotch, the distributing agents m
Maoriland and Tasmania. In the same
quarter is the old-issue department, in which,
preserved in hundreds of compartments, are
“back numbers” of every issue of the three
papers for many years past. Somebody
remembers a drawing, a piece of verse, an
article or a story printed perhaps 25 years
ago, and calls for it, generally with apolo-
gies. It is very rarely that a copy cannot
be produced. Here
the much-sought-
after Service De-
partment is very
often called upon
to lend a hand;
every request for
help is welcomed
there, though it
may not always
be possible to
supply the desired
information.

information supplied by the “Wild Cat’

Cat’ Monthly.”
Possession was taken of the new home
late in August and its reconstruction was
at once begun. The reinforcement of the
ground floor was first put in hand. The
central entrance from George-street was for-
tunately wide enough to admit any motor-
truck. A travelling crane was erected over
the site for the heavy presses the full length
of 140 ft. Meantime the work of taking
down the first
press was put in
hand at the old
premises. Th c
problem was to
remove the entire
plant piecemeal
and still carry on
production, and
to do it so well
that no reader
should be aware
from the quality
of the papers that
anything out of
the way was hap-
pening. A time-
table was drawn
up,, and though
work was carried
out under great
disadvantages it
was kept to the
hour, and not a
mail nor an ordi-
nary dispatch ser-
vice was missed.
The six-ton
trucks, with their
loads, were driven
into the building,
and with the aid
of the travelling
crane the work of
re-assembling
went ahead with-
out a hitch. The
process of dis-
mantling, remov-
ing and re-assem-
bling the entire
pla n t occupied
ten weeks. Immediately a machine was
set up in its new quarters it resumed
its old job. and, with the help of messengers
and a telephone service, production was
carried on continuously. But the business is
one which those responsible for it don t want
to undertake more than once in a lifetime.
The old home was left with many regrets.
Many great men had worked in those dark
and dingy premises—and growled and
grumbled at their inconveniences. Not all its
old cherished associations were human, either.
Down on the ground floor, alongside the
cashier’s office, from which the weekly free-
lance payments were made, was the “Poets’
Bench,” upon which thousands of visitors
have sat. for a moment —and taken back
home one more city experience to talk about.
A long procession of writers and artists had
made this a meeting-place —back to the days
of Phil May and Frank Mahony and Henry
Lawson and Will Ogilvie and Victor Daley.
Though battered and strained it still has
its honored place in the Archibald Gallery.
There was an easy climb, but still a
climb, to the first floor, where Archibald
worked in his day, and Edmond in his much
longer day; a stiffer climb to the second
floor in which “Hop” for so many years had
his studio —in his later days a slow, weary
climb, with the same rumbling formula every
morning at Macleod's doorway at the end of
it - “Mornin’, Mac. When are you going to
do away with those damn stairs?” And
at. the top of the stairs a Bulletin singer
of to-day who watched the long procession
of “singers of other times” :
I see them come with their rhymes,
Ringers of other times.
ftcc them loiter and stand
With a song, in the hand;
With a dream maybe in the eyes
Of a dawn that must rise,
When the rod shall blossom, not flay,
And the poorest dog hare his day.
Dust gilded by the sun
Is all they see who run ;
But- if yon pause for dreams
You’ll feel the life that teems
About the time-worn ways,
And hear the roundelays.
All the old memories, all the old traditions
come with the great machine and the little
machine to the new office. The Bulletin,
attached as it was to the old home, could
not stand still. Even the very surroundings
had cried out that this is a world of move-
ment. When first. The Bullet.in crossed
over from its rat-haunted old quarters in
Pitt-street, at the end of the first 10 years
of its life. “Lower George-street,” as every-
one then called it, was a narrow thorough-
fare poking a tortuous way towards the
Quay With the outbreak of plague came
the resolve to clean up all that historic old
territory of the Rocks which lay between
George-street and Darling Harbor. The
old rookeries on the western side were torn
down and the frontage pushed back, and out
of the narrow lane, largely by
Chinese, emerged the George-street North ot
to-day, with its tall buildings and never a
Chinese of lower status than that of "mer-
chant.”
The Bulletin was glad to welcome to
its old home any who were sufficiently in-
terested in its history or its work to
come to it. It will be as glad to welcome as
many to the new home; and it thinks
perhaps the visit will better pay for the
time taken to make it.

belts they are assembling Bulletin sheets for stitching (each of these machines denis with 4000 papers

Escape
By E.V.Timms
MR. Exodus Bar-
renhead Hep-
plebloom,
attired in a puce sac
suit, magenta check
tie, magenta check silk
socks, tan shoes and gleaming pince-nez, sat,
ill at ease, at liis table in the Cafe Melange.
The food was excellent. Mr. Hepplebloom was
not in need of money, and, outside, the early
spring afternoon was sunny and warm. Even
the orchestra on the dais at the end of the
little cafe—violin, flute and piano—was con-
tributing melody. Yet Mr. Hepplebloom was
obviously unhappy. His slender white hands
toyed restlessly with knife, fork, spoon and
crushed bread-roll. He had no appetite, and
his Semitic features, with their peculiarly
mild blue eyes, were expressive of apprehen-
sion—even of fear. He sighed, he sipped
cold water, and he sighed again and left his
food almost untouched.
The sympathetically observant waiter com-
municated this odd intelligence to the pro-
prietor, who promptly wrenched himself
away from his beloved cash-register and came
and sat down at Mr. Hepplebloom’s table.
The cafe was almost deserted, anyway.
“What’s the matter, Heppy?” demanded
the friendly fellow.
Mr. Hepplebloom carefully wiped his
pince-nez with a puce silk handkerchief and
then replaced them. He looked sadly at his
interrogator.
“There is no escape, Peter.”
The florid proprietor, a ball of fat in a
skin-tight, fawn-colored suit, sat up quickly.
“No escape?” he echoed, staring hard at
Mr. Hepplebloom. “What”
“No, no! Nothing criminal, Peter,”
groaned Mr. Hepplebloom. “But I’ve been
marked down”
The proprietor’s hair bristled. It was that
kind of hair.
“The razor gang? But they’re as dead
as the”
“No, no !” wailed Mr. Hepplebloom. “What
has a gang, any gang, to do with me? My
money was left to me. I have been marked
down—selected, in fact —by a woman. A
woman. She loves me. She told me so.
Her father told me so. I’m in a ghastly
hole, Peter.”
The proprietor grinned a little. “Poor
Heppy ! But it serves you right, boy. You’ve
been pulling everybody’s leg about your being
married for so long that you’ve come a
Cadorna at last. Haven’t you repeatedly,
after the third drink, convinced all and
sundry you are a married man?”
“But I can’t help it—after the third
drink!”
“I know. W T e all know. I’ve got no
sympathy with you. I’ll send you three
drinks and a perambulator.”
“Don't be a damn fool, Peter!” snapped
Mr. Hepplebloom. “They terrify me.”
“What? The drinks?”
“No, no! The young lady and her father.
He i.s a Kurd, I think.”
“A Kurd? A Kurd? You never were
any good at slang, Heppy. You mean a big
cheese.”
Mr. Hepplebloom moved restlessly. “Don’t
be idiotic, please. Can’t you think of any-
thing but blasted food?”
The rotund proprietor rose to his feet.
“What’s the lady’s name?” he demanded.
“In strict confidence, it’s Shasta—Shasta
Debut.”
“Good looking?”
“Hideous. Tall. Wears black. Legs like
a walking scissors. Got a permanent wave,
no hat and wears sandals. Sandals, the
ancient gods of Israel! You should see the
people stare! Black stockings and .sandals.
But she and her father are intellectual —
you know the type. And she’s dark—wears
horn-rims —thick lips, fat cheeks. What’ll I
do, Peter?”
“God knows,” said the proprietor a little
more sympathetically. “Better have a drink,
anyway.”
“I’d better not. You know what a fool
I am after the third.”
“When will she marry you?”
“I don’t know. But it will be soon, I
fear. I feel it will be soon. She’s talking
about spring.”
“Oh. Hell!” murmured the proprietor.
“What’s the big cheese like?”
“Don’t say ‘cheese,’ Peter. The man’s a
Kurd. Grasmos Mosef Debut. Was a pro-
fessor, so he says, at one of the Kurdish
universities. Tall man, darkish, a trifle
mournful, with a sweeping moustache and a
nasty black eye—not an eye that has been
blackened, yon fool! He’s writing a blasted
book. Calls it ‘The Machinations of Man.’
Underlying idea is that the only sanity is
death. God—you should hear him on it!
And the swine eats bacon!”
The proprietor looked thoughtfully down
upon the unhappy little Mr. Hepplebloom.
“Well, after all, I don’t see you’ve got
much to kick against.”
Mr. Hepplebloom gasped and grew paler.
His little blue eyes receded to an infinite
distance behind his glasses.
“You don’t see” he quavered. “Didn’t
you hear me say ‘bacon’? I thought you were
a friend of mine?”
“I am; but both the bacon and the girl
will probably do you good—make a man
of you.”
“The one wrnuld make me sick and the
other—have you ever been crushed against
a mountain, two mountains, of perfumed,
palpitating femininity? Bah! No, you
haven’t. She’ll probably propose this after-
noon. In the Museum. Or the blasted Art
Gallery. In the Art. Gallery, I think—
standing near something rather springish.
Cunning devils, women !”
“Better get ‘shot,’ Heppy, if you want to
remain a confirmed bachelor, my boy. If
this Shasta daisy gets a proper halse or
Boston crab on you—good night.”
Mr. Hepplebloom shivered. “I never get
‘shot,’ Peter. I know my weakness. One
drink, and I imagine I’m in love; two drinks,
and I’m engaged ; three, and I tell the world
I'm married. I know, I know! But I
should loathe myself if I became intoxi-
cated.”
“Well, I’d get ‘shot’ if it was me.”
A faint sneer curved Mr. Hepplebloom’s
thin lips. “Did you get ‘shot’ before you
were married —just before, I mean?”
“No. But I would now. And I’d stay
‘shot.’ But please yourself, Heppy. Best
wishes, anyway. Have a cigar.”
“Thanks. . You’re a good fellow, Peter,
but coarse,” said Mr. Hepplebloom as he
rose from the table. “And she pats my
cheek—blast her !—and calls me Exodus !”
“You poor devil,” murmured the pro-
prietor, skilfully returning two shillings out
of ten. “But you’re off early, ain’t you?” •
“I’m to meet them. We are to do a little
shopping, and then have tea —or something.”
“Humph! Glad it ain’t me. Be in to-
night?”
Mr. Hepplebloom paused at the door and
placed his bowler hat on his head.
“There is to be a reading of the second
chapter of ‘The Machinations of Man,’ ” he
muttered. “There w*ill be people there.
Queer people who smile sadly at you and
then touch you for a few bob. They will
mumble complimentary rot about the profes-
sor’s drivel and then go home baffled and
wondering what the old fool was talking
about. But I’ll know. Shasta will tell me
—too^blasted right she will!”
“Why don’t you give her the air?” ven-
tured the mystified proprietor.
QUITE A DIFFERENT THING.
THE LADY FRIEND. So she s left that brute at last, has she? Tin sure she’s hod enough
of him by this time!”
HER GENTLEMAN FRIEND: “I wouldn’t say that, old girl—but she’s probably had all
he’s got.”
“The air? Shasta?’’ Mr. Hepplebloom
laughed a trifle wearily. He seemed in need
of a little air himself. “There are some
women to whom you might give the air-
in fact, the whole embellished atmosphere—
but not Shasta. She’d gulp down all the air
you gave her in one ecstatic sob, and then
come back at you for a refill. No, there’s
no escape.”
“Oh, well,” said the proprietor philoso-
phically, “you’ve recommended marriage to
many a poor, bewildered sap. It’s your pill
now. Dick off the sugar and swallow the
rest. You’ll be all right, son. So long.”
“I don’t see anything to grin at,” re-
torted Mr. Hepplebloom severely.
He walked ont into Pitt-street. Slowly
he walked, glancing furtively about him. He
had the urge to turn his coat collar up and
pull the brim of his hat down over his eyes.
AH the joy of living, of life, had departed
from his diminutive being. He felt like
the moth that walks towards the pin that
will impale it. Marriage! Shasta! He
shuddered. He flourished his puce silk hand-
kerchief and dabbed at his pallid lips. No
escape. Dong evenings with his head
cuddled against Shasta’s enormous bosom;
dreary days and nights absorbing the mysti-
cism permeating ‘The Machinations of Man’!
The professor’s hypnotic eye. Shasta’s
scissors-like legs. Sandals. Bacon. No
escape!
He heard her
calling him
across Pitt-
street. She had a gentle, maidenly voice,
happy with innocence, yet strangely like
the sound of tearing calico. Mr. ITepple-
bloom’s commonsense said, “Run, run, you
blasted idiot,” but his limbs seemed petrified.
He wanted to grasp his hat, throw back his
narrow shoulders and break even time
through the traffic. Instead he found him-
self grinning inanely and moving slowly to-
wards the beaming Shasta and the glooming
professor. He glanced hurriedly at himself
in a window and sofily cursed his reflection
for looking like a dejected rabbit in a puce
suit and a bowler hat. Indubitably he was
not himself. But how could he be? There
was no escape.
Shasta wanted to embrace him, but a
desperate jolt of his nervous system enabled
him to sidestep and leave her in baulk. He
raised his hat and shook hands with the pro-
fessor, who drooped absent-mindedly over
him. Shasta’s fat features folded into a
smile that lifted her horn-rims momentarily
off the bridge of her nose as she gloated over
her captive.
“Oh, Exodus,” she cooed. A little crowd
began to gather. These two personalities
were obviously novelists or globe-trotting film
stars. The crowd thickened. Ethel Bhell
and Trader Thorn, perhaps. They hung on
to Shasta’s. every word. “Father and I
thought we’d do a little shopping before
allowing you to give us afternoon-tea.”
Professor Grasmos Mosef Debut’s deep
voice rumbled an affirmation. “Yes, yes.
Young love, young love. How happy I shall
be to see its consummation ! How are you,
Exodus? Take his other arm, Shasta. Exodus
will walk between us. Bacon, was it not?”
Shasta’s girlish laugh tore across the street
They moved off. Mr. Hepplebloom felt weak,
although so securely held. He felt ill. Yet,
like the little gentleman he was, he smiled
bravely up at liis companions. The professor
stood six. feet five in his socks. Shasta, was
a neat six feet. Both she and her erudite
parent were clothed in black. Mr. ITepple-
bloom, trotting between them, moved along
almost unseen.
“Yes, . father, bacon. Here is the shop.
I'm cooking the meal to-night, Exodus. There
is a treat in store for you.”
“Er—thanks, Shasta. Decent of you. But
really, I—l —somehow I don’t fancy
bacon”
“A mere prejudice, darling boy,” boomed
the seductive Shasta. Her horn-rims wobbled
again. “You won’t know it is bacon after
I have cooked it. Here wo are, father. I’ll
select it. You know, father, you are too
partial to bacon-fat. What is the matter,
Exodus?”
Mr. Hepplebloom dabbed at his lips again
with the lurid handkerchief. “N-nothing,
Shasta. A touch of indigestion, I think.”
“Poor darling! I shall not be long now.
No, to the attendant. “Please don’t bother
to cut any. I’ll take the side—yes, that one
will do. .Tust as it is. Father loves cutting
the bones out —no, no! My friend here, who
is paying for it, will also carry it.”
Mr. Hepplebloom leaned against the
counter for support. The world was rocking.
A side of bacon ! A side ! Cursed offal! And
he was to carry it through the streets of
Sydney—he, Exodus Barrenhead Hepple-
bloom ! God! Was the woman madV A side!
The side of bacon was plumped into his
arms, which, somehow*, had held themselves
out to receive it.
“Be careful, Exodus, darling—you very
nearly knocked down a little child. And mind
that dog that is following you. Shall we
have tea? And then visit the Art Gallery?
You dear boy!”
Mr. Hepplebloom choked. His knees
sagged. “Tea?” he managed to articulate.
“Did you say”
“Oh, thank you, Exodus. You are so
thoughtful. Be careful of that window, dear.”
Mr. Hepplebloom was inwardly raging,
burning with a white heat. Curse the win-
dow ! And the bacon! And the gaping,
grinning fools that followed.... Was the
blasted street full of dogs? Tea? Dear Lord
above!
“Don’t mention it, S-shasta,” he quavered.
“Shall we go to”
“Let us go to the New South Wales”
The professor interposed. “We cannot, my
child. The New South Wales is closed.”
“Oh, how unfortunate! I just loved it. It
gave one such con-fidence.”
“Yes,” continued the professor moodily,
“I understand there were financial difficulties.
Let us go to the Australasia.”
“But—but the bias the bacon ?” bleated
Mr. Hepplebloom.
Shasta squeezed his free arm affectionately.
“We are not shackled by convention, darling
Exodus,” she crooned.
He gave in and they went. A table w*as
engaged, and the side of bacon placed on a
chair by itself. They sat down. Gradually
the happy chattering throng at the tables
was silenced. People began to move un-
easily and several were detected looking down
at the soles of their shoes. Mr. H'epple-
bloom was reduced to desudation. He wiped
his pince-nez continually, and then desper-
ately insisted upon something more stimulat-
ing than tea for a beginning. The professor
brightened and instantly agreed. Shasta
pouted prettily, adjusted her horn-rims and
glanced coyly at the limp Mr. Hepplebloom.
The side of bacon was forgotten. The drinks
were brought and Exodus paid.
“Don’t —don’t you take anything with your
whisky, Shasta?” he asked, a little surprised.
“Dear boy, it is such a little drink —
medicinal, you know,” she gurgled.
“Quite,” rumbled the professor.
They each drank whisky neat, and to Mr.
Hepplebloom’s relief the smell of the bacon
became less offensive. Perhaps another drink
might
“Why, yes, thanks,” said the professor.
“You are a darling,” whispered Shasta.
Everyone heard her, everyone turned and
stared. They were not rude, they merely
thought she was in pain. Whisky again, neat.
Mr. Hepplebloom sighed, shook himself and
glanced round him. The stimulant sent a
comforting glow through his chilled veins.
Not at all a bad place, the Australasia.
Especially when one is in love and engaged
to be married.
“l)id you suggest another, Exodus?” said
the professor hopefully.
“I- —oh, yes, of course. Waiter!”
“You really are adorable,” sighed Shasta.
“Here it is.”
They drank and smiled at each other. Mr.
Hepplebloom did more than smile. He
beamed. He leaned back in liis chair quite
at ease. He looked sympathetically at Shasta
and affectionately at the professor. It was
a shame, he told himself, a blasted shame, to
deceive her any longer. It amounted almost
to seduction.
“When we are married, Exodus,” Shasta
was trumpeting.
Mr. Hepplebloom held up a slim white hand.
“Shasta, forgive me. I think you should
know. I am married. I am a married man.”
You have seen a coiled! snake slowdy raise
its head? Then there is no need to describe
how Shasta and the professor slowly straight-
ened themselves on their chairs.
“Exodus, what did you say?”
“I said lam a married man. I really
should have told you before. But now I
simply must give you the air, Shasta—and
that big cheese, too. Unless you care, to
meet the wife. Have another drink. It's
on me, anyway. Yes, I am proud to say I
am a married man.”
“A married man?”
“A married man!”
“Yes, a married man. I revel in the state
of connubial felicity. I should have been
home to lunch, really, but Vi won’t mind.”
Shasta’s voice was a cross between a rasp
and a croak. “Vi?” she inquired.
“My wife, of course. You must meet her
—and her relations.”
“Relations?” growled the professor.
“Oh, yes. She deceived me there. But
I have forgiven her.”
“Oh?” from Shasta. She slowly took off her
hornrims and handed them to the professor.
“Yes. First her mother came —a jolly
woman who made a great fuss of me.”
“Indeed!”
“Indeed, yes. Then her father. He potters
about the garden. His eldest son helps him
with the slugs. Tiresome work. The three
sisters do all they can for Vi —another drink.
Professor?” N
But the professor and his daughter were
already on their feet. Shasta’s large hands
were clutching the side of bacon. Mr. H'epple-
bloom, warming to his subject, stared at
them and through them. In spite of Peter
he. couldn’t see any resemblance between the
professor and a cheese.
“But when her aunt arrived with her step-
daughter”—
The side of bacon went up above Shasta’s
permanent wave. A gasp of amazement and
horror rippled round the staring guests.
“ 1 naturally protested—ouch ! What
—what hit me? Some —-something hit me!”
Mr. Hepplebloom heard the professor’s
voice very faintly. It sounded afar off. He
also thought he heard men laughing and
women screaming. But the professor’s voice
was unmistakable.
“Give him another one, Shasta. Hit him
with the ham, child ! You have had a narrow
escape. Again ! But don’t ruin the bacon,
dear one. It has a nice piece of fat on it.”
Mr. Hepplebloom never knew whether lie
received tin' other one. All he remembered
when they brought him round was that some-
one had had a narrow escape.

WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Our Special Representative in the Soup-
ville electorate weighed in with this after
reading all the papers:—
William “Basher” Stubbins, one of the
Lang party’s truest supporters (“L. Daily”)
is a twister (“Sun”) and a traitor to his
party (“World”).. He is a foreigner
(“Herald”) born in N.S.W. (“L. Daily”)
who has the interests of the farmer at heart
(“L. Daily”), and is bitterly antagonistic to
the welfare of the man on the land
(“Herald”). He has led a blameless life
(“L. Daily), having done three years in
Queensland (“Smith’s”) and been a noto-
rious -member of the “basher gang”
(“Herald”). This political novice (“Sun”)
cares nothing for the electors (“Telegraph”)
and gave up a respected position (“L.
Daily”) as a Parliamentary briber (“Truth”)
to devote his life to the interests of the
people whom he has served (“L. Daily”)
and cheated (“World”) for the past 20
years (“L. Daily”). A vote for the unscru-
pulous Stubbins (“Telegraph”) will be a
vote in the right place (himself) as it will
be another vote for hooliganism (“Sun”).

WHAT STARS FORETELL.
“Saturday,- December 12: Some unfortunate hap-
pening connected with young people may mark
to-day’s activities. There will be many accidents,
and troubles for the police or military. Not good
for the man on the land, mining or foreign affairs.”
—Jose Charlton-Smith in “Sunday Sun,”
Special reading from our Office Seer:—
Saturday, December 19: Some unfor-
tunate happenings
connected with- sup-
porters of the Lang
Plan will mark to-
day’s activities. A
loss of deposits is in-
dicated. Between 8
a.m. and 8 p.m. cars
will carry passen-
gers in defiance of
the Transport Act,
and the trams will
lose in revenue not
less than Is. 6d. but
not more than
£1.000,000. News-
papers will refer to
the * “People’s Day
of Power,” and those
who don’t want to
be fined will act
accordingly. Bars
will be shut, but this
will not affect those
who have the fore-
thought to get in
adequate supplies the
night before. By 9
p.m. the following
phrases will begin to
be heard about the
city and suburbs:
“Woddid I tellyer?”
—“The cows got
what was coming to
them.”- —“A moral
victory.” Between 9
p.m. and midnight
dejected men, mostly
elderly, with gold
ornaments on their
watehchains, will say
to their families:
“This means the dole.”
“Intelligent men despise horseracing.”
—Sydney parson.
Anyhow, a good many will have High
Disdain for the Christmas meeting.
BEFORE HIS MASTERS.
“The time has come,” the speaker said,
“To talk of many things —
Except taxation, deficits,
And gerrymanderings.”
* *
“The modern sailor is often an abstainer, but
seamen of the old type still drink heavily.”— “Sun.”
Hence “Hearts of Soak.”
* *
“Whatever happens, the Christmas ritual must be
observed.” — “S. M. Herald.”
Sydney can be relied on to do the rite
thing.
* ¥
“A snake was recently found at Manly Beach.”
Probably thought it was back in Eden.
“The elections will be over and its animosities
forgotten before) the festive week.”— “S. M. Herald.”
Good! We don’t want cross currants in
our pudding.
# *
“Overcrowding is a genuine menace in Sydney.”
Yet Lang goes on packing the Upper
House.
SOMETHING NEW.
“Electors are tired of the same old boasts and
promises contained in leaders’ policy speeches.”
Well, w r hy not something more attractive?
The Prime Minister said the electors
WHAT WOMEN HAVE TO MARRY.
“I notice your ’usband always has his hair cropped
short, Mrs. Thumps.”
“Yes—the coward!”
should bear in mind, that during Labor’s
regime Australia had regained the ashes.
Under the Bruce-Page rule Bradman had
never been able to make a double century in
a Test; whilst Labor was in office the Boy
from Bowral had rung the bell no less than
five times. (Cheers.) Mollison’s record-
breaking flight had been made whilst Mr.
Scullin was Prime Minister, and as a final
proof of the prosperity which was a national
stable-mate of Labor Government he
need only mention Lindrum. (Deafening
applause.)
The Leader of the Opposition said that the
Government’s rule had been
one long disaster. Twenty-
three week-ends had been
spoilt by rain and the public
had been misled into backing
Phar Lap for the Cup. If
punters returned the U.A.P.
an Act would immediately be
passed making it compulsory
for Phar Lap to return and
win the next Cup at tens. Ad-
mittance charges to the Tests
would be abolished. To bal-
ance this a tax would be im-
posed on runs scored by the
South Africans, also a bill
would be introduced making
Australia a certainty for the
next Test, which would defi-
nitely not be postponed on
account of rain.
The Lang-plan Leader said
there was only one issue—the
Olympic Games. Vote for
Langism and the result of the
games -would be a foregone
conclusion. The reappearance
of “Boy” Charlton was typi-
cal of the good woi-k being-
done by the party, and he
pledged his word that, if given
a working majority in the
Federal H'ouse, he would,
through his trusty seat-warmer
in Reid (Alderman Gander),
take steps to bring the
Draughts Championship to
sunny New South Wales.
(Cheers.)
“Opposition members were specially summoned
for the debate in which the Scullin Ministry was
defeated.”— “Age.”
Apparently someone was determined to
give them the office.
* *
FOUND.
The man looked thoughtfully at the paper.
No illustrations of beach beauties; nothing
about Phar Lap; complete silence in regard
to the number of airmen projecting a flight
from England to Australia or vice versa; not
a word about Bradman. He turned it over.
No prize competition coupon ; not so much
as a cross-word puzzle. Nor was anyone
being exposed as a public menace. Suddenly
the look of mystification vanished from the
man’s face to make way for one of pleasur-
able anticipation. From his pocket he drew
a tin of fine-cut, and proceeded to roll his
cigarette.
ENDING THE DEPRESSION.
The best brains of the Present hav-
in'l" proved unequal to the above task,
Madame Zozo, the promi-
nent medium, has secured
some expert advice from the
Past.
Henry the Eighth. —“ Let
Mr. Lang pass an Act for-
bidding marriage except by
a Trades Hall official at
£2OOO p.a., whose duty it
will be to hand all fees to
the Treasury. Fees: £lO
each marriage, £2O for a
divorce; and make it com-
pulsory for each adult to
marry at least six times.
Budget equilibrium should be
attained within six months.”
Lucretia Borgia. —“ You
have the wrong men at the
head of affairs! Send your
political leaders for a cup of
tea and a quiet chat with
me, and I guarantee that
they won’t make any more
mistakes!”
Nero. —“l admire your
modern party politicians.
They are making the same
success of their jobs as I did
in ancient Rome. Only one
thing has been omitted —a
match applied in the right
place. Start with Parlia-
ment House while Parlia-
ment is sitting.”
Cleopatra. —’“You haven’t
nearly enough sex-appeal in
your public life —I’m sure I
couldn’t live with either Mr.
Scullin or Mr. Lang. Elect
better-looking politicians who
will be able to persuade the
girls to vamp bondholders
and overseas creditors.”
“H. Skidmore, who piloted Magnesia, seems to
have a great future in the saddle.” — “Herald.”
Another celebrity with his future behind
him?
# *
“Haunted Fowlhousje.”
Can one of the fowls have laid a ghost?

“At this season of the year a general foolishness
overcomes all of us, of which we are quite un-
ashamed.”—“Sun.”
For instance, we won’t mind how often
we are taken for mugs.
CHRISTMAS “TIME.”
“I’m not ashamed to stand where I do.”
Defiant Melbourne defendant.
He stood there debonair and gay,
Although his words his hearers shocked;
He knew that in our land to-day
It is the custom to be docked.
“Never mind about other currencies—we want to
get the Australian £ back to normal.” — “Argus.”
On the principle that parity begins at
home.
THE MUGGINS PLAN.
“I see,” said Mrs. Muggins, “half the world
has gone off gold;
My business friends seem staggered at its
caper.
You’ll understand my interest in the matter
when you’re told
That Mr. Muggins last week went off
paper.
“/ hadn’t a. suspicion there was anything
amiss
Till I had a ring from Reachmedown, the
draper;
About that cheque of Mr. M.’s,’ he said.
‘Well, it’s like this,
It looks to me as if he’s gone off paper.’
“Explain yourself,” I snapped, not liking his
familiar ways.
‘The cheque’s a dud, a stumer, an escaper,’
He said. ‘l’d been anticipating it for days
and days.
Now, sure enough, your hubby’s gone off
paper.’
“And if he has,” I countered, “who are
tod to blame the man?
He never was a saver or a scraper.
And, anyhow, it’s part of what he calls the
Muggins Plan —
Vis.: Pay your bills in cheques, then go off
paper.”
ELECTION RESULT.
From coast to coast they're bellowing their
fierce linguistic thunder,
And every candidate avers that he’s a living
wonder.
But all their ballyhoo awakes in me no
eager cheering —•
I’ve had my fill of baits thrown out by chaps
electioneering.
I never worry now who wins, or who gets
put to rout,
For I know that, once they get my vote, for
me it’s — eight — nine — out!”

These Old Gods
BY OSMAR E WHITE
RUMPELMEYER looked at the English-
man curiously, expecting, it seemed,
some little sign of emotion. Even in
the old days, when the paddy-fields on the
pans were a clear green, there were few
overseers who would not have been eager
to transfer from Koana Bunji to the coast.
And now’....
The inspektor dusted a grey ash from his
yellow’ silk sleeve.
B but a matter of time, Myiiheer
Balfour, he pointed out. “I saw the same
thing happen twenty years ago when the
Karak-oomi craters were changed. That
was w’hen the Huysen people had planta-
tions on the bay. For some little time we
were doubtful, hoping”....
. Bis large, lemon-colored hands gestured
significantly towmrds the casuarina-tree in
the compound. Its blossoms were falling
in a forlorn shower, rustling before a cur-
rent of w’ind. The grey dust poured in lazy
trickles as the boughs stirred.
Balfour w’as silent. Rumpelmeyer’s hollow
boomiiig came to him as from a distance.
“But a matter of time, Mynheer Balfour
yes. You say that this commenced a
week ago. But last year the lava over-
flowed on the north rim and burned the
Aralkopi villages. It was a warning. Do
you think that Batavia would have with-
drawn the controleur of the district had
there been hope, eh? Ach, come now.
Mynheer, come now! You say that the
ash may stop to-morrow. So it may indeed.
Or six w’eeks or six months
hence —or never. Come now,
Mynheer! Even the fisher-
people will go in time. They
will starve otherwise. I have
seen it happen before, I tell
you. First a man here and
a man there slipping aw’ay, fur-
tively, afraid of being thought
a coward. Then a family. A
proa. Two proas. ,Yet, be-
fore they all go, there will be
a little praying or a little
fighting; or they will just sit
still waiting for the miracle.
Men are like that. But I
tell you that five years hence
there will be no Koana Bunji.
Lapun Agi will have buried it
in grey ash. Even now you
see, Mynheer, it drops down
like the rain, from the Heaven
—only a little, but every-
where.”
Balfour stirred impatiently,
crossing and recrossing his
legs.
“All right, Rumpelmeyer.”
he said irritably. “All right.
You don’t imagine that I
really want to stay, do you?”
The Dutchman grinned. “I
was beginning to think,” he
said ironically, “that Mynheer
Balfour had come to love
those rubber-trees of Mynheer
Van Doom too much. Van
Doom has had no better man
here in all his thirty years.
He himself told me so!”
Balfour laughed mirthlessly.
“Most kind of Van Doom,
I'm sure. It explains, no
doubt, many things —my love
for his trees has been consid-
ered sufficient reward for
eight years! No, Rumpel-
meyer. Since Van Doom can see fit to trans-
fer me only when there is no more profit
in Koana Bunji for him, I can see fit to tell
him to go to Hell !”
Rumpelmeyer’s stout body quivered. His
blue eyes were round with surprise.
“But, Mynheer,” he stammered, “it
is not a transfer. Van Doom abandons
Koana Bunji. You are unreasonable. You
do not understand.”
Balfour rose abruptly. “I understand
quite enough, Rumpelmeyer,” he said.
“So you may go back to the almighty Van
Podsnaffle and deliver my message. I don’t
want his job.”
The inspektor leaned back, slapping
imaginary mosquitoes. The man was mad!
A thousand guilders bonus—and refused!
Good God!”
“Want a drink?” inquired Balfour, tilt-
ing the bottle on the rattan table-top.
Rumpelmeyer surveyed the ugly, tanned
face of his host questioningly. The lean
lips were twisted a little—this time in
genuine humor. There was a spark in the
nondescript grey eyes, peering out so quiz-
zically from under shaggy brows. He held
out one plump hand for the glass.
“That’s right, Rumpelmeyer. Make it a
stiff one. Not every day a poor devil of a
plantation manager tells Van Doom to go
to Hell, is it—even by proxy?”
Rumpelmeyer sw’allowed the spirit thirstily
and lay bach sighing. There was a moment’s
silence. Of a sudden he asked:
“What is in your mind, Mynheer?”
“Nothing—yet.”
“But you are not staying here? You
have no reason?”
“I don’t know.”
“But you cannot stay, Mynheer Balfour.
I have told you.”
Balfour shrugged. “Monrad the mis-
sionary is staying,” he said indifferently.
“Telia !” Rumpelmeyer exclaimed. “Mad !
A fool!”
“Then you suggest that he has no rea-
son?” asked Balfour.
The big man eyed him sombrely, finger-
ing the wisp of brown hair on his chin.
Neat gin was buzzing in his ears.
“Pish!” he exclaimed drowsily. “Reason?
No reason at all. If I had a wife here, by
God, I’d No, I am not the missionary
Monrad, for w’hich I am duly thankful.”
His heavy eyelids flickered. “Anyhow,”
he went on, suddenly ruminative, “he has
been a failure. Thirty converts in eight
thousand people. Two hundred pages manu-
script of St. Matthew in the dialect of
the Orang Kopi—which no one understands
forty miles from here. Um. A failure.
But he will stay on—for the Splendor of
God—until his thirty good Lutherans go
yowling back to their own gods, and that
will be the moment the volcano has burned
their young rice!”
Rumpelmeyer closed his eyes. Balfour
walked softly on to the verandah.
It was late afternoon and the sun hung
low down by the margins of the bay—a
globe of hazy crimson. The surfwash, slop-
ping on black sand, was veiled by the ashen
mist out of the north. The shallow water
was full of it. It stirred on the ground in
sluggish eddies. It trickled in tiny cascades
from the limbs of the trees. It greyed the
air.
Balfour, eyes turned towards the moun-
tain, saw dull, brown streaks on the foot-
liills where hot. scoria had fallen, killing
the jungle. Yet it might be clear to-morrow
—a year hence—or never. Rumpelmeyer
had said that, and he w T as rignt.
NOT SO PARTICULAR.
“Now, what do you drink?”
“Weel, Dochter, seein ye’re sae kind, Scotch whusky and soda—mair whusky than
soda. But if it’s no handy, anythin’ ye’ve got.”
He could see, too, the cluster of sheds
about the old K.P.M. pier and the straggling
lines of native houses along the beach.
There were eighteen hundred souls in that
village. They drew sustenance from the
narrow paddy-fields on the pans and from
the fishing in the bay. What would become
of them when the harvest failed, as fail
it must; when the half-formed grain shriv-
elled to black powder in the ears ; when the
fish left the dirty shore-waters or died in
the shallows; when the volcano stirred
itself and shook down the ramshackle lints;
or when the Orang-miji came starving down
from the hills?
Even as he stood looking, the sky dark-
ened and the air filled with a hollow whis-
pering. Balfour put his feet wide apart
and waited. In this last year the Giant had
stirred more than a hundred times.' Lately
it. had become almost usual for a small shake
to occur in the afternoon. He watched the
pathway which led to the storage sheds —
saw a man come running, and of a sudden
fall limply in a heap. The path was undu-
lating in tiny ripples, with the fallen ash
on its surface rising and curling over like
a line of miniature' surf. A door crashed
behind him and the nails in the floor-boards
squeaked.
Balfour staggered a little at the first
shock, and turned as the inspektor, Rumpel-
nieyer, reeled past him into the open.
“Hey, there!” lie called. “Steady on,
man! Come back. It’s nothing, i tell
you!”
The big man’s face was livid, bis eyes
staring wide with panic.
Balfour laid a hand on his quivering arm.
“Small earthquake,” he explained. “If
you’d been here as long as I have you'd
know better than to take any notice of
them. It’s the fourth this week. Come
inside and have another drink.”
Rumpelmeyer faced about, wiping the
beads of sweat from his eyes. “I was
asleep,” he said plaintively. “Dreaming.
Balfour’s fingers closed hard and fast on
the arm. “All.right. I know it’s the Devil
when you’re not used to it. But there really
is nothing to be scared of. By the way,
Rumpelmeyer, when do I pay off the
labor?”
The Dutchman slumped into his chair.
“The labor should have been paid off when
this started,” he complained. “Why have
you stayed? Why did you not report? If
I had known”....
“Exactly,” said Balfour. “But. as I
said, one becomes used to it. When do
I pay off?”
“To-night, if you wish. Now. if you
can. I am going, Mynheer. This place-
do you not realise? I come here. Forty
miles away one can see the crater spouting
fire. One lives under the glare of it. in
the shadow of ash. There is no daylight.
The earth trembles under one’s feet. I
was asleep, Mynheer. Sound asleep. Do
you not realise?”
-Balfour laughed, showing square, chipped
teeth. “And you brought the pay-money?”
he persisted.
Rumpelmeyer nodded.
“Very well. then. I will pay the men
at the end of the month, when their time
is up. They’re locals, all of them. They
cannot go away.”
Rumpelmeyer's mouth opened and closed
soundlessly. Then : “You are not coming!”
“Not yet.”
The Dutchman’s lips compressed them-
selves. “So.”
“Exactly—so.”
“I sail with the tide, Mynheer. You will
not change your mind?”
Balfour’s voice w 7 as slow’ with studied
weariness. “Repetitions, Mynheer,” he
said, “are very tiresome. You will deliver
my message to Mynheer Van Doom?”
Rumpelmeyer rose and placed his topee
very firmly on his head. “Yes,” he said
thoughtfully, “I will deliver it most cer-
tainly.”
Balfour grinned a little as he went out.
Now the hour of sunset on Koana Bunji
is, of all hours, the most beautiful. Each
day Balfour watched from the hillock behind
the coolie lines—a lank, drab man in sweat-
stained drill, who stood motionless while
the leaden land around him suffused with
crimson light. Then, in the gathering of
brief dusk, he would walk down to the
mission house .by the peepul grove, listen-
ing to the shrill clang of the bell for even-
song.
More often than not the pastor’s wife
would be standing by the thornwood fence,
her slim body leaned against the old, grey
■wood and her face a smudge of uncertain
white in the lialf-darkness. Balfour’s greet-
ing never varied: “A good night to you.
Mevrouw Monrad.” Them they would stand
together for a while, speaking of eommon-
place things: the last mail, the next mail;
the heat; Lapun Agi, the mountain—though
for many days now this last had seldom been
mentioned. Balfour w’ould peer at her un-
observed, since she rarely looked directly
at him, but always stood with her head half-
turned and one ear attentive to the sound
of the bell.
Yet, on the night when the inspektor's
schooner cleared the green light of the
entrance for the last time, Balfour’s “Good
night” to Mevrouw Monrad was crisp to
the point of roughness.
“Van Doom,” he said presently, “has
decided to pay off the labor, Mevrouw. You
had hoard?”
She turned quickly. “You will be leav-
ing us, Mynheer?” Her quiet voice w T as
toneless.
Balfour’s eyes met hers gravely. “I do
not know,” he saicT deliberately—“yet.”
She was silent for a minute. The clang
of the bell had risen to crescendo. The
still air shuddered at the insistence of
sound.
“But if Van Doom pays off the labor,
there will be no need for you to stay?”
“No need,”, he agreed. “But since I am
not transferring to the coast, there is no
hurry either.”
“Not transferring?”
Stirred by a sudden suspicion, she leaned
nearer, laying her hands on his arm. “But
that is unfair, my friend! Not transfer-
ring to the coast! It is shameful. Have
you not worked among his trees for eight
years? What fault is Lapun Agi of yours,
eh? Tell, me!”
The quiet voice had become uneven nowT—
alive with indignation.
Balfour smiled. “There now,” he said,
“don’t condemn too soon. I have not said
that Van Podsnaffle refused to transfer me.
It is merely that I am indisposed to be
transferred. That is all.” '
She laughed helplessly, slapping the palm
of one small, white hand against the old wood.
“Van Pod-schnaffel! Aeh, Mynheer, but
you are so dr011.... Then you return to
England perhaps? I—l am glad.” The
voice was wistful now. “It is a good thing
to return to one’s native land when one
has been lonely.”
Lonely? Balfour’s lips tautened. Eight
years, eh? Eleven thousand guilders... .a
Java cookboy who spat in the curry for
luck....home papers twice a year. And
memory 1
No, he was not lonely. One
must have friends to be truly
lonely.
“And you, Mevrouw —are you
ever lonely?” he asked.
She pursed her lips. “Some-
times, Mynheer. My brothers
are in Eindhoven, you see—and
my father and mother. And
the Dommel is very beautiful
on mornings when the sun is
coming up behind the brick
towers! And the cold.” She
shivered in delicious reminis-
cence.
“Then it is only sometimes?”
“Not ofteu —and only a very
little. Hans, you see”....
“Go on,” he prompted.
“He is so fine, Mynheer. He
fights all the time. You do not
know how’ hard he fights to
make success. The people are
ungrateful towards him, though
he is so patient. He is always
patient, Mynheer.”
Balfour could feel the blue
eyes challenging him through
the dark.
“Aye,” he said shortly, star-
ing at the ground, “always
patient; and faithful to his own
God.”
She had turned at the sound
of a step on the path. Balfour
looked up quickly. “Good night,
Padre,” he said in English.
Monrad was not without his
small vanities. “Goot night,
Mynheer.” The missionary’s
voice held a subtle quality of
cold joviality. “Eet has been
hot, hot, yess?”
“Very,” said Balfour, grin-
ning in sudden consciousness
of this invariable formula.
“You saw Rumpelmeyer, I
suppose?”
“He came,” said the pastor.
“He came. We will miss you very mooch,
Mynheer. We are sorry. You will come
in this once—eh?”
One time in twenty Balfour acquiesced.
It was an occasion.
“More, padre,” he said lightly ; “if I may,
I will attend your service in the church.
Afraid I’ve not been much of a parishioner
since you came, sir.”
Monrad’s hot hand fell on his shoulder.
The woman was on his other side, one of
his great arms about her waist. “Gome,”
he said, turning down the path, “we will
go in together, Mynheer. I am glad.”
Under the palm-thatch of the church a
great oil-lantern was burning, staining the
white wood rafters with subtle shadow. Save
for three wooden benches by the lectern the
floor was bare, hard-tramped earth. Even
hero Balfour could see a. powdering of pallid
volcanic dust. His eye travelled over the
bent, brown backs of the converts—planta-
tion boys all. They half rose at his coming,
muttering: “Aka, tuan — aka”....
Monrad frowned and gestured them hack.
They squatted, looking sideways. Obeisance
to the white man in the house of God? Whv
not?
The missionary’s wife slipped in between
the deal forms and sat, spreading her white
skirts with deft hands. She smiled up at
him, patting the seat beside her.
Balfour looked hard; saw the white skin
of her face, touched so faintly by yellow;
the vivid child’s mouth and the low, placid
forehead marked by shadowy dimples.
Behind him there was a faint shuffling The
air was hot and still, filled with the smell
of sweating bodies.
Monrad. in vestments, came in again and
knelt. There was a rustle of harsh voices
in prayer. Balfour glanced sideways. The
golden head was bent dutifully; but her eyes
followed, with proud faithfulness, the slow


movements of the man who led his pitiful
army in supplication.
They were singing now, dispiritedly.
“/fas tyan mibilei sunami tyjta. .. . Lord
God of Hosts!”
Balfour sighed and climbed to his feet.
He knew this: a hymn.... A wood-louse
crawled from knot-hole to knot-hole on the
empty deal form in front. He watched it
for a while and began counting its turns.
When, one by one, the worshippers had
gone out into the night, Monrad came down
smiling and rubbing liis hands. Balfour
looked at him closely, A strange type, this
Danish-Dutchman from the Dommer: lean
to the point of thinness, liuge-boned; the
mouth of an Inquisitor and the forehead of
a saint. His small, blue eyes burned with,
a cold fire.
“You will take coffee, Mynheer, or”—
he smiled with paralysing goodfellowship
“something a leetle stronger, joost to say
goot-bye?”
“Not ‘good-bye,’ ” explained Balfour plea-
santly. “As yet, since I am not going to
the coast and have no definite plans, I must
stay.”
The saintly forehead convulsed itself into
a hundred small moving lines.
“Not going, Mynheer? We are surprised.
Is it not so, Freda? Most surprised.”
Balfour would have made some further
explanation, but the man moved ahead of
HIS CUE.
FIRST GENIUS: “How do you spell ‘financially’?”
SECOND DITTO: “F-i-n-a-n-c-i-a-l-l-y. And there are two r’s in embarrassed!”
them abruptly, leading the way into the un-
liglited house. Within there was the warm
smell of . cooking and faint mould.
Monrad scraped a match and set the flame
to the lamp chimney. The room was shabby
and half-furnished w 7 ith very old battered
furniture.
“You will sit?” he invited. “Freda will
see to the coffee, Mynheer.”
She went silently.
Balfour sat, stirred restlessly, and rose
again. “Look here, Padre,” he broke out,
“when do you intend to leave here?”
“Leave, Mynheer?” Sheer uncomprelien-
sion clouded the hard, blue eyes. “Why?
“For the very good reason that your stay
is eventually limited by the mountain, said
Balfour, harshly precise.
The missionary smiled. “Then the answer
js plain,” he said. “I shall go when the
mountain defines the limit.
“I see. And —your wife?”
“I cannot understand how my wife enters
into the question. After all, Mynheer, it
is my affair —and hers.”
Balfour changed color a little. xour
pardon,” he said, faintly sardonic. if my
instincts of—can we say friendship?—be-
trayed me into an impertinence. But lias it
ever occurred to you that some other factoi
beside the mountain may limit you good
people in the hopeless task of missioning
where you are unwelcome?”
Monrad’s eyes flashed frosty fire. _ That,
Mynheer,” he said coldly, “is an imperti-
nence which even friendship may not excuse.
It is” ..
“I refer,” continued Balfour, struggling
against the rising tide of finger, “to the
natives themselves. Since Batavia withdrew
the Qontroleur there has been, no Govern-
ment influence here other than that ot tne
irregular patrols from the Buma Kampong
district. When you first came here, even
the Buddhist labor resented you. _ lhe abori-
ginals themselves Damn it, man, i
know your business is your business, but 1 m
speaking for the best. Even bastard-Malay
fishermen have a sense of fidelity ; and they ii
be true to the old gods. You shake your
head Have you ever convinced them —in
seven years of prosperity or one year ot
poverty —that Christ w 7 ould intervene and
save their homes in an eruption? You
couldn’t! Yet the mountain-worshippers
and the fire-worsliippcrs believe implicitly
that, if they can appease the wrath ot
the old gods, Koana Bunji will be saved.
You tell them ‘No, Koana Bunji cannot be
saved, but I can offer you a very beautiful
philosophy by which you may order the short
rest of your lives; and I can promise you
the White Man’s Heaven.’ You know they
cannot believe you ! But you set your virtue
and your faithfulness first. You have made
a bargain with your God —‘if I am faithful
you will save me' You will sacrifice tnat
which is of far more value” .
Monrad’s lean body unbent from the chair
like a steel spring, his face suffused. -Be
silent!” he barked.
Balfour paused, open-mouthed, at this
counterblast of white-hot anger.
“So,” Monrad continued, “you are silent.
Now go V 9 1 ,
Balfour nodded. “I expected that, he
said quietly. “But I hope, Mynheer, a sense
of outrage will not prevent you giving
thought to what I have said.”
For the first time he was conscious that
the coffee cups had been set out on the table,
and he turned. Was it anger _he (saw
in the woman’s blue eyes meeting his t
Reproach? Or nothing? Yes, merely no-
thing. They were placid. The red mouth
was mobile, the lips parted and moist. The
breasts under the white linen bodice rose
and fell with slow evenness.
“Leave us, Freda.”
Monrad’s tone was impersonal—uncom-
promising—a command to something merely
animate. , „
Her golden head turned, and the spectre ot
a smile lurked in the dimples of her cheeks.
“Good-bye, Mynheer,” she said simply. “I
am very sorry that you should quarrel.”
Balfour went silently.
In the weeks that followed the signing-
off of Van Doom’s labor, Balfour had, for
the first time in almost unbroken activity,
leisure for uninterrupted thought. Yet to
him the very stillness of the world was dis-
concerting, in that it marked the passing
of those carefully-acquired habits which had
given his existence the semblance of purpose.
He would awaken at five o’clock, listening
for the sound of the sleepy chipping-gangs
gathered about the morning fires. Silence.
No squeaking of bellows in the smoke-sheds,
no profane shouts from the Number One
men, no clanking of hoes and rattling ot
bowls.
Once even, heavy with sleep, he leapt
angrily out of bed calling for Mata, the boss-
boy, and the shout died in his throat. Mata,
with seventy-five of his fellow-villagers, had
gone in Sai Wing’s schooner to the mainland
the day before. Er-Miggi had trotted off with
liis bundle and his goat along the clay track
which led to Karko, fifteen miles north. One
by one his fellow-tribesmen followed the
same grey route, with little clouds of ash
billowing up round their ankles. Makkim
and Lau. Little Copper Tommy, ,too.
Then he went back to bed and slept for
a time —restlessly. The wind was stirring
the branches of the casuarina, and its rustle
crept over the threshold of consciousness,
whispering voiceless agitation. He was free,
it was speaking to him; he was free, and the
things which he had hated hurt in their
passing!
What now 7 ? Home. The bright, wet
pavements he had loved, the sound of passing
footsteps, blessed chilliness, walls that rose
up about him, eyes
that could meet his
full and still be un-
seeing. No damned
dying tree to sob out
its swan song in
the dawn, when the
sea was live gold;
no twilight, when
the sunset glowed,
crimsoning the
muddy water of the
bay: no bell clank-
ing and clanging in
the shadows. No
white face half
turned from him in
the darkness. No
quiet voice saying,
“A good night to
you, Mynheer!” No
unvoiced, foolish
dreams!
No. That passed
—fell away below
the edges of the
world when the
Green Light faded.
Five years out of
eight, eh? —while the
image of a desire
and a purpose as-
sembled itself, limb
by limb, against an
old grey fence in
the twilight. An
image—rather than
the desire itself.
Men are like that.
So Balfour rose, grinned a little, and went
out to potter with salvage in the drying-
sheds. Knowing Mynheer Van Doom, he
suspected that a schooner would drop in
one of these days.
On the morning of the fifth day from the
exodus of the gangs, Lapun Agi moved. The
rim of the old crater collapsed and a new
crater formed. The first lava, flowing slug-
gishly from this last outlet, overwhelmed a
village of the Orang-miji, and its inhabitants
fled down to the coast settlements.
The bay, the town itself, even though
farther away from the menace, seethed with
a simultaneous eruption of suppressed fear
and excitement. There could be no reprieve
now. A thousand-year-old threat, in the
face of which they had built their houses and
tilled their fields, had become a reality. Along
the coast ash fell more thickly each hour. At
night there -was torchlight among the huts
at Koana, feebly challenging the Heaven-
high glare in the north.
Balfour watched it all very calmly from
the verandah. Three hours after sunset
there came up to him a sound of singing and
drum-beating. Then the mission bell com-
menced to ring, first with the old lazy jangle,
then coming gradually into crescendo until
it seemed to shriek.
Balfour found a small revolver in his desk
and walked over the crest of the hill down
to the peepuls.
There were lights in the house and in the
church. At the latter he paused, peering in
at the doorway. It was empty. Then he
w-ent off towards the fig-trees where the bell-
scaffolding stood, calling “Monrad! Myn-
heer Monrad!”
The bell trailed off into silence, squeak-
ing as it swung.
The man made as though to pass him with-
out speaking, but Balfour reached out an
arm. “Here, Monrad,” he said. “There’s
going to be trouble here in a few hours. No
sense in quarrelling now.”
The missionary’s voice was harsh. “I
have no need of you, Mynheer Balfour. No
need.”
“That is as may be. On the other hand,
I have need of you. I said that there would
be trouble, and I am right. Have you been
into the village?”
“They are going—all of them. All, I tell
you, Mynheer ! All of them!”
Balfour detected the nerve-racking squeak
of hysteria.
“Precisely,” he said with brutal clearness.
“They are taking out fowls and dogs and
goats to appease the anger of the mountain.
Also, if my Java boy tells me the truth, they
are taking out two of your converts. There
is going to he trouble. Don’t you realise
that they must do something, poor devils?
Don’t judge harshly, Monrad. Now, come
into the house.”
The woman Freda met them by the door,
a lamp held high over her head. Her eyes
were great liquid pools of fear.
“Ach, it is you, Mynheer! Then I am
glad.” Her hand clasped his wrist. “What
shall we do?”
Balfour’s heart was pounding. “Go in-
side,” he said gently. “There is nothing to
fear, Mevrouw. Make us coffee.” He turned
to the missionary. “Monrad,” he said, sit-
ting down, “I don’t suppose it has ever
entered your head that you might have to
defend this place in the event of riots?”
“No, Mynheer. I have never done harm
to the people. I have healed their sick,
spoken with them, fed them.”
“You have firearms?”
“No, Mynheer. Nor shall they he used.
I am a man of God.”
“Even if your life — hers —were forfeit to
your righteousness?”
“I cannot argue with you, Mynheer Bal-
four. You do not see.... Yes, then, if you
will. If it is God’s wish. We have done our
best.”
“Then there is nothing more to do?”
“Nothing, Mynheer, except to wait —and
pray.”
Even as he spoke there came a red glow
at the window, a distant mutter of the giant
rattling the door-frames.
Then there was a crash. Balfour rose
from his seat slowly and began, with stiff
fingers, to gather the books which had fallen
“BOOS I HAVE KNOWN.’’- THE STORYTELLER.
from a stained deal shelf. Monrad had gone
to the window.
“Look, Mynheer, look!”
A great fan of fire was spread over the
northern sky, which now was laced with a
white-hot filigree, rending itself and tum-
bling its molten threads into a deluge of
slow-forming crimson drops, each drop a
ton of liquid rock.
“Ah, God is wonderful. Mynheer!’’
The man’s eyes glowed with a light of
exaltation. The woman was standing by
his side, white-faced. But her eyes were
fixed on the ecstatic countenance.
Then a new ash-cloud blotted out the rod
plume of the crater. In five minutes it was
falling, rustling down like warm rain on the
roof.
At midnight the torches were in the vil-
lage streets again. The thin, high shouts
of the marchers came up clearly. “Close the
doors,” said Balfour sharply. “If I know
anything about your flock —or those poor
devils you’d have liked to have for a flock,
Monrad —we are going to have visitors in
half an hour. And when you close the doors
barricade them.”
Monrad opened his mouth to protest, but
the lean, slovenly body of the Englishman
had straightened curiously. His eyes were
hard.
“Jump, blast you ! Jump !”
And before the sudden fulfilment of this
man’s mission, Monrad jumped.
There were lights stirring on the outer
edges of the peepul grove, setting the gnarled
shadows a-shake; the sound of voices; the
patter of feet. A man came running.
Balfour, revolver in hand, met and stayed
his rush by the stoep. The yellow-brown
face was stained with the sweat of fear and
breathless running.
“Oh, run, Tuan!” he gasped to the mis-
sionary. “Oh, run, bada-tuan —run, run!”
Monrad smiled at him. “Why should I
run, Kraji?”
“They have taken Balak and Seebura.
They are angry against you, bada-tuan, be-
cause the god of the mountain is angry
against you. He moves. See!”
“There is only one God, Kraji. Do you
not believe? Have I not told you about
Him?”
But the torches were glaring amongst the
trees, and Kraji, with one desperate bound,
was gone into the shadows, pounding with
terror-stricken feet.
There was a cry in the darkness —a snarl-
ing. The flares waved madly.
Balfour could see dark figures darting
across strips of reddy light. Then a sudden
quiet fell. The vanguard of the villagers
had halted a dozen yards away, and the fol-
lowers piled up against the halted line rest-
lessly.
Balfour stood still, waiting for the first
move. He did not see Monrad step forward
to the railing, and he scarcely heard the deep
voice call in the dialect, “Oh, people, for
many rains you have known me.” The long
thin arms were stretched out in the age-old
gesture of the pulpit.
As he spoke, a single kreese came whining.
His arms dropped slowly, and he slid gently
down on to the ash-powdered boards.
Balfour shot six times, deliberately, kill-
ing with each bullet.
They ran headlong, casting the torches
aside into the tinder-dry weeds, where they
flared and threw up showers of yellow-
sparks.
When the garden was empty, Balfour
knelt down. Monrad raised himself on one
elbow and the Englishman leaned forward
to catch the whispered words: “You should
not have done it, Mynheer, poor, godless
people of mine!”
When they lifted him on to the bed, he
was dead.
Hot scoria was falling in the town when
the landing party from the gunboat Vaneek
came up to the mission-house. “Good night,
Mynheer,” said the half-caste lieutenant with
a little flourish of pride in his voice, to' the
lone figure standing on the verandah, revol-
ver in hand. “There has been trouble here
with the natives? Do I address Mynheer
the pastor?”
“You do not,” said Balfour. “Mynheer
the pastor has finished his service. But his
wife is here —safe.”
“Ach,” said the lieutenant, no little puzzled
by the Attitude of uumovoble cnliniicss, J.
ain sorry that we were not in time, Myn-
lieer—deeply sorry.” He hastily removed the
white-crowned cap.
“I think,” said Balfour slowly, that Myn-
heef Monrad almost wished it to be so.
Mevrouw Monrad will return to the Netlier-
lands by the Batavia mailboat. I. sir, would
be glad of your assistance as far as Buma
Kampong. I have business with Mynheer
Van Doom. I thank you. No, please do
not disturb her for the moment. She is at
worship.”

MRS. JINNY'S SHROUD
BY KATHARINE
SUSANNAH PRICHARD
WHEN it was known that Charley Beck
and his old woman had specked a
30oz. slug and several smaller ones
and struck a reef of gold-bearing quartz about
fifty miles north-east of Top-o’-the-Morning,
there was a rush from the almost deserted
mining township for the ridge on which
Charley and Mrs. Beck were camped.
For over twenty years the old couple had
been prospecting on those wide, dry plains
and shingly ridges, joining every rush to a
new diggings and doing odd jobs on isolated
cattle stations between while. They went
about in a buckboard with a couple of horses,
a box of hens and a spinning-wheel Mrs.
Jinny had brought with her from the Old
Country. She was Hungarian, she said ; had
come to the goldfields with her first husband
in the early days, but he had died of fever
in Coolgardie during the typhoid epidemic
of ’93. Charley was a foreigner, too, a Nor-
wegian or Dane perhaps. Nobody knew
which. Nor did it matter out there, where
they were well met with everybody, pros-
pectors, teamsters, sandal-wooders _ and
drovers from Southern Cross to Nullagine.
In all the pubs, on all the mines and
stations, yarns were told of Charley and
Mrs. Jinny. How everywhere she went her
spinning-wheel went, too. That and her box
of white hens. When they moved camp, Mrs.
Jinny and Charley, they put the hens in a
wire-netted box and packed them on the
buckboard with the rest of their belongings,
a dryblowcr-shaker, camp-oven, pick, shovel,
dishes, a couple of oil-drums for water, and
a mattress of parrots’ feathers.
For years Mrs. Jinny had been hoarding
feathers of all the birds she and Charley
shot for a meal, grey-blue feathers of the
crested pigeons and green of the parrots —
“twenty-eights,” which flashed in hordes
over the plains in a good season. And a fine
bed they made, when she had stuffed all the
feathers into a bag of unbleached sheeting,
sewed up the end and spread the mattress on
the ground for Charley and herself to lie on.
All the garments she wore she had woven
and stitched together herself, twisting
threads from any old sheepskin on her wheel,
plaiting them together on a crazy little loom
Charley rigged for her, and dyeing the cloth
with brews from bark, quandongs or the red
earth itself. Although she did not wear too
many, it was said. No more than a gin,
with an old hat of Charley’s for dignity.
And she had spun herself , a shroud for fear
Charley might have nothing to lay her out
in if she died on those sun-blasted plains
or in the ranges where they used to' wander,
fifty or a hundred miles from anywhere.
Men on a rush or camped beside Becks’
buckboard for the night, knowing how proud
Mrs. Jinny was of her shroud, would say
sometimes: “Come on, Mrs. Beck, show us
your shroud.” And Mrs. Jinny, if she were
in a good humor, would go to her tin box,
lift up the bag she kept the shroud in to
be safe from white ants and moths, and
spread it to be admired. Woven of neat
threads shackled closely together, and dyed
a sober brown, that soft woollen stuff was
the masterpiece of her weaving. It had
been blessed by a priest in the Top one
winter; and nothing pleased Mrs. Jinny
more than to be told how fine she would
look when she lay taking her last sleep in
it under the paper daisies which flowed over
the plains after rain.
Dirty and dust-grimed her clothing had
been for years, but she was determined to
look pretty when she was dead, the boys
said, joking and teasing her 'about the
vanity and conceit which had gone into
the making of her shroud.
On the rushes and on the roads, droving
or well-sinking, she had the reputation of
being a hard-doer, Mrs. Jinny; of swearing,
drinking and making-up to any man who
took her fancy, for love of the game. But
she stuck to Charley and he stuck to her.
On the stations, when she took a job as
housekeeper sometimes, Mrs. Jinny was a
different person. She made herself dresses
of blue print from the store, and was quite
a good-looking little woman when you could
see her face for the red dust that most times
powdered it. Her eyes were the blue-green
of Roebuck Bay on a mild day in winter, and
her fairish hair took a smooth shine when
she washed the dust out of it and brushed it
to lie close to. her head.
Wiry and tireless she worked all through
a long dry season on Gindoo one year, mak-
ing great batches of bread and cakes, cook-
ing their hot midday meal of roast beef for
the men, and coaxing green vegetables to
grow on the claypan when nobody else could.
They talk still on Gindoo of the wonderful
cook Mrs. Jinny was, and how she bossed
everybody, Jim Hunter included, though he
was managing Gindoo and Wheelarra for
Smiths in those days.
But Mrs. Jinny was as bad as a black
when, she got tired of things. She dropped
whatever she was doing and went off with
Charley. They wandered about the ranges
until all their money was spent and stores
gave out. Then, if they could not get any-
thing to do, fencing, well-sinking or droving,
Mrs. Beck would go housekeeping on one of
the stations again, and Charley would work
about the place, blacksmithing or doing odd
jobs to be near her.
With men Mrs. Jinny was quite at ease,
jolly and devil-me-care: went about singing
queer little foreign songs and rousing at
everybody who did not please her. But she
was afraid of women. Would never work
on a station if other white women were
living there.
Once on Sophia Creek, when she was
housekeeping for Andrew McPherson, Mrs.
Bob Wilmot and another woman came in
for the night on their way down from
Mooltha Downs, where they had been spend-
ing the winter. Mrs. Beck gave them a won-
derful meal. She had been cooking all day
for it, and was very shy and polite with
the ladies. They were greatly taken with
her and praised her delicious foreign cooking
until Mrs. Jinny was shivering under her
excitement and pleasure. With little depre-
cating gestures, all sweetness and embar-
rassment, she tried
to explain when
Mrs. Bob asked her
how “kinedliky”
was made; but, ex-
cited and tangled up
with her words, it
was not un<«ril from a
difference in the visi-
tors’ expression she
realised what she had
been saying. Then
she fled in dismay
and cried all night
because she had let
fall a full-blooded
oath or two in their
presence.
Mac himself tried
to console her. But
Mrs. Beck sniffed
and wept whenever
she thought of what
she had said, and .
would not face the women again. Camel Jo,
who was carting stores for Sophia Creek, had
been the apple of her eye on Sophia till
then, but even he could not comfort her.
Mrs. Jinny called .Charley to bring in the
horses, packed her spinning-wheel, swapped
hens with the storekeeper and was gone by
noon next day. .
Nobody had seen or heard anything ot
Mrs. Jinny or Charley for months, when Jo,
tracking a couple of camels strayed from
his team, came on her beside a shaft she and
Charley had sunk on that ridge out from
Top-o’-the-Morning.
Jo did not know Mrs. Jinny at first.
Thought it was some old gin winding dirt
for a prospector down the hole. But when
Mrs. Jinny sang out to Charley with a
string of her own particular oaths, he knew
who was talking.
“Hullo, Mrs. Jinny,” Jo hailed; “hows
she goin’?” .
Mrs. Jinny was so surprised and delighted
to see' him “that she God-damned his eyes
and kissed him before he knew what she
was doing; called down to Charley that here
was Jo and his camels and to come up at
once. She tipped out a hide bucket of
quartz and greenstone and lowered away for
Charley. As the windlass squealed under
her winding she chattered away eagerly:
“Struck her this time, Yo._ We’d seen only
colors for weeks, when I picked up a rock
to fling at a dingo prowling after the
hens, yust before sunset. It was heavy.
Spat on it, rubbed off the dust, and there
was the gold. She’ll go thirty ounces,
Charley reck’ns. Specked a couple more
slugs next morning, and”
Charley was shouting before he was head
and shoulders above ground: “We got
her! We got her this time, Jo! She’s
‘ good.” He clambered over the logged edge
of the shaft, and, seizing Jo’s hand, swung
it up and down as he pranced about, still

"ERBERT: “Corn'-beef and damper.”
shouting: “We got her! We got her this
time, Jo! The old woman say she can
smell gold round here. And she was right,
eh?”
Mrs. Jinny ran over to the cart and
brought out her thirty-ounce slug wrapped
in an old sock. She showed Jo three other
small, flat, crazy cakes of gold and a little
glass bottle of ’weights.
Jo stared at Mrs. Jinny’s slugs and the
broken quartz Charley held out to him. Then
he swore slowly with conviction. “You’re
made for life, both of you.”
Charley and Mrs. Jinny thoroughly en-
joyed their importance _ on the rush which
followed their declaration of alluvial gold
and application for a reward claim. Every-
body went to them for advice and informa-
tion. It was Becks’ Rush, their luck which
had brought prospectors like flies round
a wild-bees’ comb. Old mates from all over
the countryside came trudging into the camp,
and sprawled yarning at night before the
camp-fire, with its forked sticks on either
side and smoke-blackened billies swung on
a tough mulga sapling between them.
The recollection of old-timers stirred
laughter and gossip—of Charley the Goose,
Mickey the Priest and Mexican Jack; of
perishes for water, fabulous slugs and golden
holes, ,sprees and disasters in the early days
of Coolgardie and White Feather.
One of the first men on the ridge, after
the result of Becks’ crushing became known,
was Peter Allison Barnes, manager of the
Top-o’-the-Morning mine and agent for a
syndicate of southern investors. “Sweet
Alice,” as he was called, because of the song
he could be depended on singing if he were
“bending an elbow,” had made and lost
several fortunes, mining, and could still
never resist a likely
pro p o sition. But
Charley and Mrs.
Jinny would not
hear of the option
he suggested. They
had no intention of
selling their mine,
they said. Not yet,
at least.
Quite satisfied with
it and themselves,
they went on work-
ing Becks’ Luck in
their own haphazard
fashion. Old Misery
and Blunt-Pick took
turns with Charley
on the windlass
winding-up stone,
and Mrs. Jinny
sewed bags, packed
all the ore she
could into them
and stitched up the ends. Any pro-
posal to part with their mine met with
keen, suspicious glances from both Charley
and Mrs. Jinny. They had heard so many
stories of crook deals, prospectors being
jockeyed out of their finds by signing papers
and allowing themselves to be floated into
companies that they decided to have no-
thing to do with propositions of the sort.
Not while they could see gold. There were
prospectors on the rush now who had opened
up some of the richest mines in the country,
sold out for thousands, and were without a
penny to bless themselves with in a few
years.
“But see here, Mrs. Beck,” Sweet Alice
protested, “you can cash in now—live like
a duchess for the rest of your days. You
don’t mean to say you want to slog away
like this when you can have all the fine
clothes and diamonds you want, live in flash
hotels, take a trip to the Old Country and
be drunk every day in the week if you
like?”
“What would I do with diamonds on me
fingers?” Mrs. Jinny asked. “What’s the
matter with this dress, anyhow?”
And there she was, standing beside the
shaft, against the blue
sky, sunshine blaz-
ing about her, dirty
and weather-beaten, in
a gina-gina she had
made herself and dyed
the color of the red
earth; an old hat of
Charley’s on her head.
A month later, when Sweet Alice paid an-
other flying visit to the rush, the out-
look was not as bright as it had been.
Already diggers were leaving their blocks,
and, although Becks’ Luck was still rich
enough to be tempting, crushings had fallen
to 20dwt. a ton, and what with the cost
of fracteur, bags and squaring-up with their
mates, Charley and Mrs. Jinny were not
making as good a thing out of it as they
might have done. No mine was ever as flash
as its show, Jo reminded them. If they
could make a few thousand now and save
themselves a lot of time and trouble, why
not? They could go down to the coast for
Christmas, see the Cup and still have a wad
for their last days.
But Mrs. Jinny shook her head. She
had no idea, it seemed, but to sit down on
her mine like an old hen and cluck over
every bucket of gold-bearing stone Charley
brought out of the ground.
Jo heard them arguing about it one night
when they were lying on their mattress of
parrots’ feathers under the buckboard. They
had not bothered to put up a tent, but slept
there under the cart, with a tarpaulin spread
out from it at one side, though Jo and the
boys had built a bough shed for the camp
to take its meals in.
As he threw himself down on the stretcher
pulled out of his tent on the far side of the
bough shed, Jo heard Mrs. Jinny exclaiming:
“And if she hears you have money, what
will we do then? What’s the good to go
to the coast for her to find us?”
Charley muttered soothingly.
“If you start signing papers it has got
to be known. And I must write my name
too.- Or they will trick us out of the mine.
Ah, no, let us be together. It is good like
this. Could it be better? If we go back,
now we are old, who knows what may
happen?”
Mrs. Jinny’s voice fell away to a croon-
ing gurgle, and Jo heard Charley’s mut-
tered and mumbling endearments, until all
was quiet under the starry skies and over
the dim earth.
So that was it! Charley had a wife some-
where, and Jinny was afraid of losing him if
they cashed in on their claim and went south.
A week before Christmas a thunderstorm
filled the tanks and made waterholes of
shallow diggings on all the alluvial claims.
Work was stopped and a spree mooted for
the great day. Tribes of blacks had been
wandering across the ridge and over the
plains from every direction, making down
to the soak, where they corroboreed and
practised their ceremonies at this time of
the year. Round about the soak they could
be heard all day singing the “nambey” and
“wallawollangoe”—chants for the circum-
cision, the man-making of youths. Men on
the rush did not see why they should not
have a sing-song and jollification too.
Sweet Alice volunteered to go into the
Top and bring out food and drink for the
feast, wound up his ramshackle motor-car,
the first to be seen in those parts, and went
off in a cloud of dust.
But the day before he returned, Solomon
Meyers trailed into the camp with his camels
and sly-grog waggon, on which a few stores,
boots, trousers, tools and odds and ends of
all sorts were stowed as a blind. He did
such a roaring trade that by the time Mr.
Barnes put in an appearance the Christmas
spree was well on its way.
Sol Meyers made a whisky of his own
from powders. “Solomon’s Solution,” old
prospectors called it, and swore you could
not tell it from the real thing after the first
couple of drinks. Sol exchanged it for
’weights, although settling accounts in this
way had become illegal. Not that the fact
troubled Mr. Meyers. He made a fortune
out of his sly-grog waggon and shipping gold
to Chinese merchants in Singapore..
At any rate he cleaned up the ridge that
Christmas Eve and was on his way back to
Top-o’-tlie-Morning when Sweet Alice drove
up the track with his carload of plum pud-
dings, cakes, tins of fish and fruit in gay
wrappers, biscuits, lollies, dried raisins, beer
and whisky, to say nothing of a wild turkey
he had shot on the road.
Mr. Barnes was half-inclined to turn back
to the Top and give the police certain infor-
mation they had been after for a long time.
But he presented Mrs. Jinny with his turkey
and a couple of plum puddings instead, and
invited himself to dinner with the Becks.
Sitting in their bough shed on Christmas
Day, fierce white sunlight outside, the low-
browed hills and scratchy grey scrub dark
under a pale-blue sky, savory odors in the
air from the turkey Mrs. Jinny had braised
in her camp-oven, he praised the old girl’s
cooking, and poured brandy on the plum
puddings so that the blue flames leapt and
fizzled when Jo set a match to the spirit.
There was whisky and cake and more
whisky to finish the meal with. Jo got out
(Continued on next page.)


his accordion, and Sweet Alice sang “Ben
Bolt.” He and Mrs. Jinny danced together,
sweat pouring down their faces. Everybody
sang. Blunt-Pick laid a w T hitc rose on his
sweetheart’s grave. Paddy Murphy and Bill
Duffy did a schottische, clasping and hug-
ging each other, as Jo jogged a jolly tune
with many wheezes from the bowels of his
’cordion. Old Misery lifted up a weak voice,
tuned through his nose, in “Just Break the
News to Mother,” and the chorus dragged
along happily:—
“She knows how dear Illover,
And tell her not to wait for me,
For. .. .I’m not... .coinin’ ’ome.”
And there was whisky and more whisky.
Sweet Alice was “showing,” or pretended
to be, while Charley and Mrs. Jinny were
still tacking gaily. About half-way through
the meal he told Mrs. Jinny that she had
better accept his offer of a six months’
option and ten per cent, deposit on £4OOO
for Becks’ Duck. She would never get a
better offer. He had the papers in his
pocket, and there was nothing for her and
Charley to do but sign up.
“Come on. now 7 , how about it?” he de-
manded. “Phil —philanthropist, damned
philanthropist. That’s what I am. You
know. The boys know. I’d do anything in
the world for you and Charley, Mrs. Jinny.
Love you—you know 7 I love you, Mrs. Jinny.
Everybody knows I love you; Mrs.
Jinny”
“You bet,” Mrs. Jinny said, substituting
some of Solomon’s Solution for Sweet Alice’s
good whisky. Presently the table, company
and bough shed began to slide up and down
and turn somersaults before Mi-. Barnes’s
eyes. He looked green and staggered away
from the table. Jinny winked at the boys,
whispered a word of what she had done,
and a gust of laughter followed Sweet Alice
to his tent.
Some time during the afternoon Charley
and Mrs. Jinny crawled under the buck-
board themselves to sleep off their dinner,
and Jo went off with Paddy Murphy and
the Duffys to German-Tom-the-Swede’s
camp, where the boys played two-up or poker.
When he got back to the bough shed near
which he had pitched liis own tent, Charley
sang out: “Put the hens in their box, Jo.
The old woman forgot to put the chooks in.”
Jo pulled the poor draggled hens from
the bough of a dead sandalwood in which
they were roosting and rammed them into
the box w 7 here they passed their nights.
It was nearly midday next morning, and
the camp still drowsing, w 7 hen a row from
the direction of Becks’ cart startled Jo out
of his torpor. Mrs. Jinny was yelling and
screaming and Charley howding like mad.
Jo got up to see what was the matter. He
thought a snake must have bitten Mrs. Jinny
or Charley was having d.-t’s.
At last he made out that, while the camp
was sleeping off its spree, blacks from the
corroboreeing ground down near the soak
had crept up noiselessly at dawn and taken
everything they could lay their hands on —
food, drink, the hens and Mrs. Jinny’s shroud
in its tin box.
“Me shroud, me dear, pretty shroud! And
the hens,’’ she screamed. “Oh, the devils!
The devils!”
Charley joined her lamentation, swearing
and roaring. He was looking for his gun,
but that was gone, too. His oaths resounded.
Everybody who had anything to ride turned
out, vowing vengeance and determined to get
back 'Mrs. Jinny's shroud. Men on horses,
camels an'd push-bikes dashed along the track
across the ridge to the soak, which lay on
the edge of flat open country, with an out-
crop of granite rocks on low hills flanking it.
Such a cavalcade, and such a row 7 it made,
the blacks w’ere well warned of its coming, if
any were still about. But they had a good
start. Their camp was deserted. Only a few 7
crows squawked as they flew 7 up from old
bones and the remains of stinking ’roo flesh.
Not a dog nor the shadow of a black hide
remained, though tracks w’hich had stirred the
red dust only a few 7 hours before went off
in every direction.
Before nightfall most of the hunters were
back at Becks’ Luck with little to report
except tracks lost in the sand or along rough
steep ledges of the hills.
Jo and Mrs. Jinny did not get into camp
until next morning. But they had come
across an old gin lying under a water-tree.
She had beau left for dying in the flight of
her people ; but Jo managed to get out of
her that it was true the blacks who had
raided the camp were Pedongs. The wdiite
woman’s gina-gina [dress], Ehmmm [yes].
She had seen it. Culka, the long one. Nab-
beru’s woman, had it. Which w 7 ay did they
go? Wiah-wiah [no]. She was going to die
there under the tree. She did not know.
Without stores or w 7 ater, Jo and Mrs. Jinny
knew it would be hopeless to try chasing the
blacks further just then. The Pedongs were
wild mountain people, and, back in their own
hills, so handy with spears that you had to
be careful where you camped. It would not
do to go sick or be short of water, especially
if they knew a white man’s justice was brew-
mg. Anything of that sort.
So Jo and Mrs. Jinny turned back to the
camp, Mrs. Jinny broken up to think of a
gm disporting herself in her shroud, the finest
piece of weaving she had ever done, and all
the work and weary years she had put into
collecting the wool for it, spinning, washing
and keeping it safe from moths and white
ants.
She tumbled off her horse when she and Jo
got back to the camp, crawled under the
buckboard and cried. Charley tried to com-
fort her, but Mrs. Jinny’s grief would not be
assuaged. She could do nothing but weep
and moan about her shroud, her dear, pretty
shroud.
“Sure, you can’t die now without your
shroud handy, Mrs. Jinny,” the boys joked
her. “You’ll have to make another.”
“Go 011 with you,” Mrs. Jinny wailed.
I ll never make another like it.”
“We’ll buy you one,” Jo declared. “The
boys here, and me, we’ll all put in' a bit and
buy you the best shroud ever a woman bad.”
But it was no use. Mrs. Jinny would not
be sidetracked; nor would she give Charley
any peace until he agreed to harness up and
go in search of the blacks, who she knew
would not wander far from their own hunt-
ing-grounds.
Sweet Alice had gone sick after the Christ-
mas dinner. But he came out of his tent
when he heard that Charley and Mrs. Jinny
were borrowing all the stuff they could and
up to move off next day.
" ell, I’ll be damned!” he said. “You
a wealthy woman, owning Becks’ Luck, Mrs.
Jinny, to make a fuss about a bit of rag
like that. Why, you could buy a shroud for
every man in the camp if you liked, and have
something over to play with.”
Jo and some of the others tried to per-
suade Charley that it was a foolhardy busi-
ness chasing those blacks to the Yanda water-
hole; but Charley said nothing else would
satisfy his Jinny, and he was going. An hour
or so before they made tracks, though, the
pair of them went: to Sweet Alice’s tent and
came away loaded with the tins of jam and
biscuits, boiled lollies and dried fruits lie had
given them, to say nothing of pipes and
tobacco, a bottle of whisky and a striped red
and yellow blanket from his own stretcher.
Charley and Mrs. Jinny were jubilant over
their haul, and the camp inclined to give
Mr. Barnes credit for his generosity.
He stripped his tent from its poles and
started packing his own gear soon after
the Becks had gone. Said he must go into
the Top for some medicine, and would be
back on the ridge before long.
It was not until a week later, when half
a dozen miners and a teamster pulled in
with a load of stores, that the reason for
Sweet Alice’s journey dawned on anybody.
Then Camel Jo guessed what had happened.
Cripes!” he yelled, as if a bullet had stung
him. ‘ They signed up for the mine to get
that stuff off of Sweet Alice.”
The teamster had a letter from Mr.
Barnes for Jo which explained the whole
position. There was money in the bank at
Top-o’-the-Morning for Jo. Blunt-Pick the
Duffys, Paddy Murphy and Old Misery as a
result of the understanding Sweet Alice had
arrived at with Mr. and Mrs. Beck. Five
hundred pounds was lying to the credit of
USEFUL, ANYWAY.
HUB: “Every time I look at that hat I want to laugh.”
WIFE: “Really, then I will leave it around when the bill comes.”
Charley and Mrs. Jinny also, and Mr. Barnes
would be obliged for any courtesy Jo could
show the manager he was sending up to lay
out the mine.
After a bender in the Top which lasted
nearly three weeks, Jo and the Duffys re-
turned to the ridge to do some prospecting
and peg on their own account. Nothing
had been heard of Charley and Mrs. Jinny
since they went out. But Andrew McPherson
and a stockman from Sophia, passing the
camp with cattle a few days later, told Jo
they had come on the buckboard while they
were mustering out near the head of the
creek.
The same day the storekeeper from Top-o’-
the-Morning, who had opened a shop in a shed
of boughs and bagging .beyond Becks’ camp,
brought a new prospector to the ridge. She
was an elderly woman, dressed in black and
wearing a widow’s bonnet. The-men thought
she must be wanting to open a boarding-
house when they saw her, or Their
next guess hit the mark; she was looking
for a long-lost husband.
The newcomer made no mystery about the
man she was seeking. His name was Charles
Beck, she said, and he had sold his mine,
Becks' Luck, to Messrs. Barnes and Holyoake
for £4OOO. She had read about it in a news-
paper. The newspaper she carried with her
in a small leather handbag. And she was his
wife, Charles Beck’s wife, she explained,
although she had thought he was dead; and
that was why she was wearing a widow’s
bonnet. But from what Mr. Barnes told
her, she thought the Charles Beck he had
bought the mine from must be her husband,
and she had come to find him. It was only
fair, since she was his wife—she had her
marriage lines in her handbag—that she and
her children should have a share of the money
from Becks’ Luck.
A well-spoken woman, a little deaf and
mulish-looking, the men who had known Char-
ley and Mrs. Jinny for years stared at
her resentfully. None of them spoke when
she asked if somebody would tell her where
she could find her husband.
“H'e’s not here,” Jo managed to say at
last. “He’s gone away. Been gone this last
two months.”
“Beg pardon,” Mrs. Beck offered. “I’m a
little hard of hearing.”
“He’s gone away, Charley has,” Jo shouted.
“Been gone these two months.”
Charley’s wife sat down on a box outside
the bough shed where the storekeeper had
dumped her. “I’ll wait until he gets back,”
she said.
Charley and Mrs. Jinny’s mates left her
sitting there. The storekeeper who had
brought her out from the Top would look
after her, they knew. There was a tent of
chaffbags beside his shop and she could feed
with him. But what were they to do about
Charley and Mrs. Jinny? i
Jo had intended going out to look for them,
take them some stores and tell them about
that money lying in the bank. Now, thinking
they might come into the camp any day, he
made up his mind to set out at once and
warn them what awaited them on the rush.
If; he knew Charley and Mrs. Jinny, Jo told
Blunt-Pick, Paddy and the Duffys, it would
be a long time before the ridge saw them
again.
Jo went after his camels, filled his tucker-
and water-bags, packed a load of stores, and
turned out from the soak over plains ol salt-
bush and bluebusli to the hills on their far
horizon. Two days later, having found their
wheel tracks, he rode into Becks’ camp at
the Yanda waterhole, and was shocked to find
both Charley and Mrs. Jinny looking so gaunt
and done-up. They had been living on wild
pigeons and damper for some time, and Mrs.
Jinny was really ill.
Lying on her mattress under the buck-
board, she heard Charley explain that she
had been poorly for days.
“I’m all right,” she called out. “I’ll be all
right, Yo. It’s yust the worry of losing me
shroud and chasing these black devils has
made me sick and tired.”
“Cripes, is that all?” Jo asked, standing
over her. “I’ll go after them first thing in
the morning, and you’ll have it in no time.”
Very glad and excited to see Jo, Charley
explained how he and Jinny had been ciias-
ing the blacks from one native well to
another, trying to get near enough to make
friends with them. But, although they had
come on embers of the camp-fires still smoul-
dering, never had they got within earshot of
the quarry. Mrs. Jinny swore that once,
when the tribe scuttled off as the buckboard
drew negr, she had seen a tall gin wearing
her shroud.
Jo waited until he could lure Chaney away
from the camp-fire, on a pretext of unloading
the camels, before breaking his news about
that visitor to, the ridge.
Charley swore unhappily. “Don’t say a
word to Jinny, for the love of Gord,” he
begged. “It’s no use upsettin’ her.”
While a dawnbird was fluting from the
dark trees, Jo slung water- and tucker-bags
on his camel again and mounted.
“I reck’n you’ll find the mob be the Pigeon
Rocks, Jo,” Charley said. “They moved off
from here couple of days ago, making that
way. There’s a good waterhole in the rocks.”
Mrs. Jinny sat up to watch Jo waver off
on his tall tawny beast. Then she lay back
and fell asleep for a while.
Charley hovered over her, made some tea
and tried to induce her to eat the biscuits
and butter Jo had brought. But Jinny w 7 as
restless and irritable. She would not eat, fell
asleep again, began murmuring and singing
in her sleep.
_ When he lay down on the mattress that
night Charley gathered Jinny into his arms.
They went to sleep, twined together like
that, as they had done so often before.
Charley wakened, a horrible cold fear tlirid-
ding him, so limp and cold Jinny’s frail
scraggy body lay against him. Was she dead?
Had she passed away in her sleep? He moved
and she fell back from him. He leaned over
her, calling distractedly in the starlit dark-
ness. The camp-fire was burning low. Char-
ley went over to it and threw wood on, so
that flames leapt high against the darkness
over the plains.
He took the bottle of brandy Jo had
brought and damped Jinny’s lips; leaned over
her, whispering and calling. A flutter of
breath on her dry lips encouraged him. All
night he sat wetting her lij)s and rubbing
her breast round the heart with brandy, talk-
ing to her, begging her not to leave him,
now that they could have all they had ever
needed. Now that they had money enough to
enjoy a good time and live easily. He cursed
Jinny’s shroud which had been the cause of
their wandering about like this, without
proper food, until she got barcoo and all the
rest of it; was too knockod-up to move any
more. Of what use would the shroud be if
Jo. brought it back only to wrap her in?
“Jinny, dear, don’t leave me. Don’t leave
me, now,” he begged.
Charley was sure Jinny was dying, and
anguish destroyed him as he crouclied beside
her.
Jo found him wild-eyed and distraught
when he rode into the camp early next morn-
ing. He himself thought Mrs. Jinny was
dead when he glanced, at her, her face looked
so smo'oth and small in the early light; but
a faint, breath fluttered against his cheek
when he leaned over her.
Shoving the billies over the fire, Jo moved
about getting himself something to eat. He
had been riding all night.
As he munched a hunk of corned meat and
damper and sipped his strong black tea, Jo
told Charley how he had tracked the blacks
to the Pigeon Rocks and prevailed on the
gin who was_ wearing it to part with the
white woman’s gina-gina.
It was tadgee [forbidden], a gina-gina for
the dead only, Jo had explained to old
Naberu, the moppin-garra [medicine-man].
The gin who wore it would surely die if it
were not returned to the white woman at
once. Missusjinni was sick. She was close-
up dead-feller herself, and if she did not sret
the gina-gina before she died, her spirit would
chase the tribe and give it no rest for taking
the dress from her.
The gin who had been wearing Mrs. Jinny’s
shroud pulled it off and threw it away, her
eyes wide and starting out of her head with
fear. Jo picked up the precious garment and
rode off with it.
The two men talked in an undertone before
the fire, glancing over at the place where
Jinny lay, and going over to look at her now
and then. She seemed to be sleeping quietly.
Her face looked rested and younger than they
had seen it for a long time.
“Do you think she’s a bit better, Jo?”
Charley asked.
Jo swore gloomily. “If she’s only waiting
to get this blasted thing”—he glanced at the
length of hand-woven wool where it lay on
the ground beside him, greasy and blood-
stained —-“it’ll be the last straw, I’m afraid.
She’ll die when she sees it. If we didn’t give
it to her, but packed up and took her into the
Top, it might be better.”
The murmur of voices disturbed Mrs.
Jinny. “Charley!” she called.
Charley went over to her. “Jo’s back,” he
said.
“Has he got it?” Her eyes asked.
Charley nodded. Jo picked up the shroud
and walked across from the fire.
Jinny looked at him, and then at the dirty,
earth-red, woollen stuff he carried in his hand.
Her face quivered and her eyes lighted to
those quivering flashes like sunlight out of a
blue sky. She sat up, staring at all that was
left of her shroud, as Jo held it in his haud.
“Do you think I could lie at peace in my
grave, wrapped up in that dirty old rag?”
she shrieked.
The two men stared at her aghast as she
threw back the blanket which had covered
her and started to pull on her boots.
For a moment Charley wondered whether
she was wandering in her mind, as she had
been the day before. But Mrs. Jinny picked
up her hat from the end of the mattress
where it lay. and stood before him
and Jo, in her old gina-gina, the
wiry energetic little woman they
had always known.
As Jo began to laugh, she
pulled the blankets off her mat-
tress and dragged the mattress out
from under the buckboard to roll
it up. Jo laughed and laughed,
braying and cackling. Charley
joined him and they stood there,
laughing like jackasses while Mrs.
Jinny bustled about, grousing and
slinging-off at the pair of them.
When they were all packed and
ready for the road, Mrs. Jinny’s
spurt of energy had evaporated.
She looked shaky and was ready
to laugh with Jo and Charley at
the scare she had given them.
“Best thing you can do,” Jo
declared, “is make tracks for the
coast, Israelite Bay or some-
where, and rest for a while. Get
some fresh food into you—go fish-
ing and shooting.”
_Charley agreed with him.
“What’s to be done about” Jo and
Charley exchanged glances.
“Oh, give her what’s coming to us from
the mine,” Mrs. Jinny decided. “Me —I got
Charley. By-and-bye we’ll come back to the
ridge and prospect round a bit.”
When Charley and Camel Jo, with a bit of
pencil, made out an instruction for Sweet
Alice on the back of an envelope Jo found in
liis pocket, it was a half-share in Becks’ mick
they settled on Mrs. Sarah Elizabeth Beck.
So there was a nest-egg left over for Charley
to buy new horses and stores when he and
Mrs. Jinny reached Sophia Creek a week
later. To pay for a spree in Coolgardie and
keep them in comfort at the coast for the
rest of their days, if they chose to remain
there, as well.
* * =!■• *
Must have been five years later, Camel .To
says, when he was carting stores up north
that he came on Charley and Mrs. Jinny out
on the ridge, a mile beyond the old mine.
Becks’ Luck had justified Sweet Alice’s ex-
pectations for four years, but was deserted
then. Jo thought he was dreaming when he
first sighted Charley and Mrs. Jinny in a
cloud of red dust; but, sure enough, there
they were, buckboard, spinning-wheel, white
lien's and all. Charley had set up his dry-
blower and was shovelling dirt into the
hopper, Mrs. Jinny rattling the shaker.
The Captain.
H'e went overside in the Tonga Deep,
And sped down, straight and true —
Down where the dreaming kraken sleep,
Six good miles under the blue.
“There’s a glory born of the sun,” ’tis said,
“And a glory of moon and stars” ;
But he has the peace of the sea instead,
And the weight of three furnace bars.
And we are left with a prayer on our lips,
And the wind and the sky and sea
That are meant for the sails and the keels
of ships
And sailoring men like me.
They rang on the engines “Full ahead!”
With the mate in the old man’s room;
But the ship and the crew and the sea were
dead
As the engines’ mournful boom.
For the skipper lay in the Tonga Deep,
If a corpse may sink so far,
Knowing the beauty of rest and sleep
As well as of sun and star;
And he’ll sail no more with the ranging seas,
Nor swing by the beacon’s beam,
And the miies and the lights and the long
degrees
Will be woven in one long dream.

The Choice of the Discriminating
. . . Little wonder that the new "Fisk Series”
Radiola is the choice of those who appreciate the
best in broadcast reception.
Brilliant performance, sound engineering and
distinctive appearance combine to stamp the new
"Fisk Series” Radiola as the finest four-valve all-
electric screen grid cabinet receiver yet manu-
factured in Australia for Australian conditions.
Its exceptional performance, local and inter-
state reception, beautiful tone, extreme selec-
tivity and ease of operation have made it a
favourite in countless Australian homes. It in-
corporates tone control —a simple turn of the
knob to right or left emphasises bass or treble at
will.
ONLY A.W.A. —with the most up-to-date
Radio-Electric Works in the Commonwealth
and the largest production in the industry —
could have made such a quality set available at
the low price of £39/10/-, completely equipped.
Your local Radiola Dealer will be pleased to
demonstrate this superb Radiola and explain the
easy terms on which it may be acquired.

Information Sought.
(1) Did H.M.S. Hood have the deepest
draught of any boat that has entered Sydney
Harbor? (2) Generally, have warships
deeper draughts than commercial vessels?
(3) From the point of view of accommodat-
ing big shipping, is Sydney Harbor one of
the best in the world? (4) Could Atlantic
liners of the 50.000 -ton class sail into Syd-
ney Harbor? —7055.
(1) No. When she entered Sydney she
drew 31ft. Oin. In 1927, the whaling vessel
Nielsen Alonso left the port drawing 32ft.
(2) Armored warships usually draw more
than commercial vessels of similar displace-
ment. Battleships of the Rodney and Nelson
type draw in the vicinity of 39ft. (3) Yes.
(4) Yes.
(1) How to cure and smoke fish by the
“ liquid-smoke ” process? (2) Is there a
demand for smoked fish in Queensland at a
payable price? (3) What fish are best for
smoking and most saleable? —69l4.
(1) The process, which involves the use
of pyroligneous acid, is not permitted in your
State. (2) A fair demand at fair prices.
The appearance of the product is an impor-
tant factor in sales. (3) Most of the edible
fishes found in Q’land are suitable for
smoking. Good results are obtained with
mullet, tailer, trevalli and mackerel.
Does the Loftin-White amplifier require
more valves than the conventional type? —
7094.
Valve for valve, it gives approximately
the same degree of amplification as any
other type of low-frequency amplifier, but a
two-valve amplifier operating on the Loftin-
White principle requires about double the
plate voltage of the conventional type,
usually between 400 and 500 volts. This
is because the filament of the power valve in
the Loftin-White circuit is at a potential
of about 40 volts above the plate of the
first amplifier valve, or, roughly, 200 volts
positive to earth. The plate of the power
valve is approximately 200 volts above its
filament, making a total of 400 to be supplied
by the output of the power-pack.
(1) How to make a suitable etching
ground? (2) How to apply it? (3) Would
a home-made ground be profitable to market?
—7151.
(1) Take three parts asphaltum, two parts
Burgundy pitch and one and a half parts
white wax. Powder and melt the asphal-
tum first in a glazed earthenware jar, and
when in a state of fusion add the other
ingredients. Apply very slow heat and stir
with a glass rod until thoroughly mixed.
Pour the mixture into a bowl of warm water
and knead into balls about the size of a
walnut. (2) Tie the ground in a piece of
fine silk and dab all over a metal plate that
is already heated. Spread evenly with a
dabber and when the plate has cooled smoke
over a flame from a few twisted wax-tapers.
(3) The market is limited, but it ought to
show a profit since small balls of ground
sell at about a shilling.
Composition of acid bath for etching on
(1) copper, (2) zinc? —7l46.
(1) A good slow bath is made with one
part nitrous acid to five parts water and a
piece of sal ammoniac the size of a small
nut to every pint of mixture. (2) One in
seven or eight of either nitric or nitrous
acid.
Is there any record of the circumstances
attending the discovery of the fixative pro-
perties in perfume of ambergris, which has
practically no smell? —7010.
No. The use of ambergris in perfumery
dates from very early times.
What breeds were utilised to develop the
Alsatian wolf-hound? —7092.
The breed originated from a cross of two
German shepherd dogs, one from Thuringia
and one from Wurtemberg. The latter was
rather large with pendulous ears; the for-
mer was a smaller dog, rather stocky and
with pricked ears.
(1) What are the aims and objects of
the R.A.C.Q.? (2) How can I become a
member? (3' Entrance fee and yearly sub-
scription ? —6990.
(1) To pi-ovide sendees to members in
connection with their cars and motoring,
and to promote and guard the interests of
motorists generally in legislative and other
fields. (2) By making application to the
secretary of the branch in your locality.
(3) Entrance fee, 10s. Od.; yearly subscrip-
tion, £1 Is. for country members, £1 11s.
6d. for town members.
How to dye a hide black? It has been
well tanned with wit and a1um, —7065.
Brush the surface with a solution of 3oz.
logwood or hematini crystals to the gallon,
adding about loz. of ammonia. Then brush
with a solution containing lloz. bani black
dissolved in boiling water and applied while
hot. Repeat if necessary.
How to make flooring with sawdust?
6915.
The material used is magnesium oxy-
chloride cement made of calcined magnesia
and magnesium chloride. The manufacture
is difficult and requires _ experienced
operators. Full information is given in a
British Department of Scientific and Indus-
trial Research Building Research Bulletin,
No. 1; also in U.S. Bureau of Mines Bul-
letin, 236. „
(1) Where to obtain leopard-tree seeds /
(2) Best way to plant? (3) Do pests affect
the tree? —6858.
(1) Gosford Nursery (N.S.W.) may have
a few’. (2) and (3) It is not cultivated to
any extent; no data available.
(1) What odorless woods obtainable in
Sydney are suitable for use in the interiors
of refrigerators and cool-rooms? (2) Suit-
able odorless varnish or lacquer Jor interior
woodwork of refrigerators?—^ 6Bo7.
(1) The lighter-weight hardwoods, such
as Tasmanian oak and alpine ash, northern
mountain ash or cudgerie; practically any
of the coastal brush timbers except coach-
w r ood, sassafras, if cut clear of sapwood;
M. white pine (liable to borer), or
any of the kauris, Q’land or imported. (2)
There is a wide range of Australian-made
varnishes and lacquers which are practically
odorless when dry. Lewis Berger and Sons,
Rhodes, could advise you in detail.
How can I make a newly-built cement
fishpond watertight and prevent the alkali
in the cement destroying the fish? —7004.
If the leak is not very serious and is
merely infiltrating through the cement, try
painting the surface with a solution of
watei-glass, about lib. to a gallon of water.
Apply in three coats, allowing each to dry
before application of the next. The best
w r ay of getting rid of the alkali is to make
frequent, flushings of the pond for about
10 days.
Have the salaries of members of the Vic.
Parliament been reduced since the depres-
sion? Have the Premier’, Ministers, Leader
of the Opposition, etc., had their salaries
reduced ? —7103.
Payment of Leg. Councillors has been
reduced from £2OO to £177 p.a.; of members
of the Leg. Assembly, from £5OO to £402
10s. p.a. in the case of members repre-
senting “metropolitan” districts and from
£5OO to £447 per annum in the case of
members representing “urban” or “country”
districts. The salary of the Premier and
Treasurer has been reduced by 24 per cent.,
the salaries of other Ministers of the Crowm
by 22 per cent.; the salaries of members
holding responsible positions in Parlia-
ment from 19 to 22 per cent.

’cello, should the grain run the length of
the strips or crosswise? (2) Are the ribs
ever sawn from a solid block, in one piece?
(3) Should a violin be French-polished or
varnished ? —6935.
(1) The grain should run the length of
the strips. (2) No, they are made out of
thin strips of wood, and bent to shape. (3)
Varnished, with a soft, flexible varnish. A.
E. Smith and Co., Ltd., 68 Hunter-street,
Sydney, will advise you.
(1) Particulars of Edison storage battery?
(2) Voltage per cell? (3) What are its
advantages? —7o72.
(1) The Edison cell has a positive plate
of iron and a negative plate of steel. The
active material for the positive plate is
nickel hydrate, and for the negative plate
iron oxide. The electrolyte is a 21 p.c. solu-
tion of potassium hydrate mixed with a
small amount of lithium hydrate. (2) Tne
initial E.M.F. is about 1.5 volts per cell and
the average E.M.F. about 1.1 volts through-
out discharge. (3) It is compact, light and
strong, and adapted for service in electric
vehicles and train-lighting systems. Its out-
put is about 15 watt-hours per pound; lead
storage cells range from 3 to 7 watt-hour.s for
the Plante type and from 8 to 14 for the

ment in the “Commonwealth Government
Gazette.” (4) Same as for the police of
N. (5) Fourteen shillings and four
pence per day, less superannuation deduc-
tions, but with quarters.
What rules must I observe before I can
sell home-made jams, etc., in Sydney? —
6839.
Goods must conform to the standards pre-
scribed by regulations under the Pure Food
Act. Containers must be labelled and show
full name and address of maker, true trade
description of contents anfl net weight. Use
of the words “home-made” in any label is
not permitted. Premises used for manufac-
turing purposes must comply with the re-
quirements of regulations a s to construction
and maintenance. If request be made to the
Board of Health, an officer will inspect and
advise as to suitability.
(1) Recipe for making shoe polish on a
commercial scale, (2) What is used to pro-
duce tan colors — dark, medium and. light? —
6714.
(1) Yellow beeswax, 9 parts; oil of
turpentine, 20 parts; soap, 1 part; boiling
water, 20 parts. Dissolve wax in turpen-
tine ; shred soap into boiling wrnter, and
when dissolved add to the wax and turpen-
tine. Stir the two mixtures together until
the mass cools into a thick paste. (2) Dark
tan, Bismarck browu, or burnt umber;
medium, a mixture of burnt umber and
yellow ochre; light, yellow ochre. All colors
inust be very finely ground.
Method of cleaning platinum ring set with
emerald encircled by small diamonds? —-6780.
Wash in hot soapy water containing
generous dash of cloudy ammonia. Use
very soft brush round the stones. Dry well
with a soft cloth, and brush the stones
again with methylated -spirits. Finally
polish the metal with a chamois leather. If
it is very dull, a little finely-powdered whit-
ing may be rubbed on. damped with
ammonia, before applying the spirits.
How to re-waterproof a gabardine coat?
—6646.
Dissolve soz. alum in 1 gallon boiling
water. Make a second solution by dissolving
4oz. sugar of lead in 1 gallon boiling water.
Mix the two solutions and allow to stand
overnight. Then pour off the clear liquid
carefully and throw away the sediment.
Place the material in the solution and move
it about until thoroughly soaked, then
squeeze but do not wring quite dry. Repeat
the dipping, squeeze out again and dry in
the shade on a coat-hanger.
What is rack-a-rock composed of and
how is it exploded? —69Bs.
Rack-a-rock is a combination of two con-
stituents, neither explosive separately. The
solid section consists of 98 per cent, chlorate
of potash, packed in small calico bags of
sausage shape and varying diameter. The
other constituent is murbane or almond oil
(chemically, nitrate of benzol). By soak-
ing the chlorate of potash cartridge in the
murbane oil for about three minutes it
becomes a powerful explosive. It is exploded
by detonation.
(1) Is red lead or red oxide most suit-
able for the preservation of iron- and steel-
work? (2) Is it coined that by applying
red oxide rust is forestalled? (3) As a
priming coat for lead paints, which is the
most suitable fen' (a) iron and (b) wood-
work?— 6851.
(1) Equally suitable (2) Yes. (3) Red
lead is generally used as a primer for metal-
work under lead paints and also under
oxide paints. It dries exceptionally hard and
a surface uniformly coated with red lead'
will never rust unless the film of red lead
becomes broken to an extent which will lev.
the atmosphere through to the metal. The
protective value of red oxide is determined
by its ferric content. Average first-quality
red oxide for bright-red roof paints or for
bridges is 80 to S 5 p.c. ferric. The usual prac-
tice in painting metal is to prime with red
lead and apply a second coat of red oxide.
Red lead is also used as a primer for timber
over which lead paints are used.
(1) Advantages of the screen-grid valve
over the three electrode valve? (2) In what
portion of the receiver are these valves used?
(3) Would I gain any advantage by replac-
ing my ordinary valves with those of the
screen-grid type? —7oBs.
(1) The ordinary three-electrode valve,
when used in a radio-frequency amplifier,
requires some form of neutralising to prevent
the generation of oscillations caused by the
plate to grid capacity. These oscillations are
manifested by whistling noises reproduced
in the loud-speaker. The screen-grid valve
employs a screening element, which neutral-
ises this capacity, thereby stabilising th,e
receiver and allowing a greater degree of
amplification per stage. (2) Radio-frequency
amplifier and, sometimes, the detector. (3)
It will be necessary to completely rewire
the radio-frequency portion of your receiver,
and if full advantage is to be taken of the
high amplification-factor of these valves they
must operate into a high impedence load.
Thorough screening of each stage is also
essential.
What royalties arc paid to a composer on
(1) sheet music, (2) gramophone records,
and (3) broadcasting? —7o63,
(1) No fixed rate. Usually 2d. or 3d. per
copy. (2) Depends upon the retail selling
price of record, and whether it is copy-
righted abroad or not. The usual amount is
2i per cent, of the retail price, divided
between composer and publisher. (3)
These are not fixed, but are divided in pro-
portion according to the amount of revenue
received.
I have an Alsatian pup that eats sand.
(1) Is there something wrong with him? (2)
Any books dealing with this class of dog?
—7OBO.
(1) Sand-eating is usually due to worms or
mineral deficiency. Give him the following
capsule first thing in the morning on an
empty stomach: Galo’mel lgr., areca nut
20gr., extract of male fern 8 drops, sulphur
sgr. Follow immediately after with a dose
of castor oil. The pup should get a little
sterilised bonemeal in his feed once daily,
and an occasional tablespoonful of cod liver
oil will be beneficial. (2) “The Alsatian
Wolf Hound,” by Horowitz, 10s. 6d.
What qualifications are necessary for an
Australian-born citizen, who served articles
in Sydney 30 years ago, now returning to
N.S.W. and desiring to practise as an archi-
tect?—6ss9.
Having served articles is of no avail. The
N.S.W. Architects Act provides four methods
of qualification for registration—by passing
the examination of the N.S.W. Board of
Architects; by becoming a graduate in archi-
tecture at Sydney Uni.; by becoming a
diplomate in architecture of Sydney Tech.
Coll.; or by becoming an Associate of the
R.1.8.A.
(1) Gan you recommend a book dealing
in detail with the duties of an executor?
(2) Amount of probate and succession
duties, both Federal and State (N.S.W.),
payable on an estate valued at between
£20,000 and £30,000, willed to children of
the deceased? (3) Is N.S.W. stamp duty
payable on transfer for stocks and shares
transferred by the executors direct to the
beneficiaries under the will? —7016.
(1) “The Administration of Estates,” pub-
lished by the Law Book Co. (2) Federal,
£4 12s. to £6 12s. p.c.; State (N.S.W.),
1931, £7 to £9 ss. p.c. There is no succes-
sion duty in either the Commonwealth or
State. (3) Instead of executing a convey-
ance, sign and register an acknowledgment
that the. devisee is entitled to the shares.
Does Anybody Know?
Anything about the materials, construction
and use of “water-skis”? —7078.

Reduces Operating Expense on Lorries
Heavily loaded lorries driven over rough roads need perfect lubri-
cation to avoid worn chassis bearings and gears.
Sand, grit and dirt quickly wear out bearings. To overcome friction
keep those bearings clean by the use °f ALEMlTELubricantla
pure, solidified oil containing no harmful acids, lhe ALLMlliii
System forces fresh, clean lubricant into the bearings under a
pressure of 3000 lbs., forcing out at the same fame all old worn-
out grease, grit, sand and dirt, leaving bearings perfectly clean
and perfectly lubricated.
ALEMITE Gear Lubricant will cushion and protect transmission
and differential gears under all conditions.
Perfect lubrication is the best insurance against friction trouble.

Builds Prosperity
WHAT you would LIKE to give to others,
and to yourself, at Christmas time, and
what you actually DO give, are apt to
be entirely different things—unless you have
made provision beforehand in your State
Savings Bank account!
The only businesslike way at any time to
obtain anything really worth while is through
a savings account, and the only practical way
to save in these lean times is in small
amounts deposited on paydays.
It is so easy, and so “ordinary,” to fritter away
the small sums that are worth more than
they seem —and so wise and so inspiring
to make them accumulate into a useful
fund in the bank.

Three Loves.
ONE love was like the almond-tree,
White herald of the spring,
A froth of beauty breaking free
From winter’s prisoning;
A mead to wreak, ’twixt sun and shade,
The drunken bees’ confusion;
A clustered delicate ambuscade
For capturing illusion;
A pageant passing, over-soon, nor meant for
permanent winning,
But vanished with the very moon that
silvered its beginning.
One love was like a leafy fold
Of autumn broideries;
A fluttering colorful cloth of gold
About the elm-trees ;
The richness of the maple leaf,
The oak, the sycamore;
A flame, a glory and a grief—
This love was all and more.
But long before the winter came, when first
an ill wind blew,
Gone was the glory and the flame —that love
had vanished too.
One love was like a sentinel gum,
Careless of wind and weather ;
Though changeful seasons go and come,
Still the leaves sing together,
Always. For that they hang too high,
But few its blooms discover,
No roaming hush-bees pass it by,
And each bird is a lover.
A tower whose staunen integrity no °-ale of
Fate disproves,
Staff of the world I wonder why I chose
the other loves.
VICTORIA.
KATHLEEN DALZIEL.
The Parting.
MY lover is a singer,
Her pipe’s a tuneless thing ;
You may hear sweeter music
When winds on wires sing.
She’s crooning now beside me,
Lingering till the last;
A dirge her pipe is droning,
For we are failing fast.
When we lie on the bearers,
The six-foot gap beneath,
I know I’ll hear her singing
From gum-leaves on a wreath.
Then when the grave is rounded,
With stone laid neat on stone,
A tuneless little singer
Will drift away alone.
I know she’ll vanish softly
At dusk or early morn,
And rest a while in silence
By trees where she was born ;
And then she’ll seek the scrub lands
That skirt the black-soil plain,
And faring ever westward
Will ne’er come back again.
Ah! now she’s softly lilting,
Old magic echoing,
The jingles of the ’nineties,
Old songs we used to sing.
When we were young together
And clouds were lined with cold
We drained the cup of pleasure—
We’re thirsty now....and old.

Little Girl.
T ALWAYS have a feeling
1 When I’m walking in the country,
Anri all the hills so big about, and all the
quiet there.
That I must throw my hat away,
My greed of reasoning away,
And give the wind my hair.
I always have a feeling
As I watch the paddocks whiten,
And see the tracks meandering
Like narrow bits of string,
That I should understand no more,
Nor question, but, content, implore
The static state of happy birds
Who simply sing.
So strong and deep the feeling
When the eucalypts are swaying,
And dry leaves turn and crackle,
And small white smokes unfurl,
With the hills so big around me,
And the little sheep-tracks winding,
That I am small and free again,
That I’m a little girl.
A smallness with a vastness,
Like a leaf within a forest,
A smallness with importance
In its heedless destinies.
Obeying time and season
With a simple rhyme and reason,
A simple music in the soul,
And formless in its ease!
Oh, strong and deep the feeling
(And aching in its sweetness)
That I must turn a child again,
With laughter in my feet;
Have sun upon the heart of me,
The wind again within my hair,
And all the hills so big about,
And nuiet. there!

“23.”
Sleeping, lost and lone,
Under leaf and limb,
Ne’er a cross of -stone
Asks a prayer for him.
Neither sign nor mark.
Save on yonder tree,
Chiselled in its bark,
His number —“23.”
Little is it worth
Name and age to trace;
Just a mound of earth
Shows his burial-place.
Birdk of morning fling
Jewelled notes around.
Careless of the thing
Hidden in this mound.
Years and years ago
Came he to his end ;
Death that laid him low
Proved a kindly friend,
Bitter was the cup
Mixed for him by Care;
Bitter bite and sup
Was his earthly fare.
Criss-cross and amiss
Ran his lines of fate;
Hell-on-earth was his —
Tears and fears and hate.
Scourged, derided, cursed.
Sullen, grim, apart,
Hate of all he nursed
Smoking in his heart.
Death the shackles knocked
From him silently,
And his cell unlocked
With a master-key.
Then as one who finds
Peace at last, he strode
Free as are the winds
On this mountain road.
Dust is all he was,
Earth his ashes keeps;
Under leaves and grass
Here a Number sleeps.

Trees.
I have loved these
Of all the well-loved trees:
Willows pale and cool,
Dipping their frayed green strings
Into the purplest pool,
Finding in those pure watery realms
Among the stems and reedy things
Their wavering reflections; elms,
Studded with garnet buds,
Sticky and sweet,
Circled with silver bees.
Amber and crimson in the sun that floods
Each township street,
And, like old ghosts behind the evening mist,
Dripping their filmy shrouds of amethyst.
I have loved these.
And I have loved the stark grey tea-tree
where
It builds its cloisters towards the towering
seas,
To hold the echo of the wind’s unbridled
voice,
And the brown fantail’s rhapsodies.
I have walked, lost and listening there,
Among those tangled stems as grey as grief.
When bitter leaf rasped bitter leaf,
And heard a voice cry through the gloom,
“Rejoice!
Soon shall our lifeless boughs be white with
bloom !”
I have loved these; and I have loved old
pines
Mounting the pale-rimmed hill in sombre
lines.
Oh, I have stood
Where needles strewed the ground
In the dim wood,
And made no sound
When the brave boughs were touched with
spring,
And candles lit and fluttering;
And glimpsed above, austere, aloof,
A golden-etched cathedral roof.
With windows where the sky broke through
As blue as angels’ robes are blue.
But the dark banksias against the sky,
Patching their ebon lace, I love! Oh, I
Have known the world that they have
known—
Have heard their heart-beats near my own.
The wind that blusters from the sea
And stirs their trembling strings,
Stirs me!
For I, the child of sea-born things,
For I, storm-tattered, joyous, free,
Am of their wild fraternity. •
Seared with the salty spume and burned
with sun.
Bearing a strange, dark fruit—look, we are
one!
Oh, bold, black banksias, I know not why,
Lut this I know, in peacefulness or strife,
J he tapestry you weave against-the sky
Is woven through the texture of my life!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
Man.
WHAT limit is said to man’s power
That spreads through the sea and
the sky:
Foredoomed is he like a sunflower
To flash with great splendor, then die t
Be cancelled and vanish to nought,
Disperse till all semblance has ceased —
Who leashed even lightning to thought
And kennelled within him the beast?
Who pitied all creatures and threw
Quick darts at each virtue-garbed sm,
Beheld, a-quiver like dew,
The gleam and hushed beauty within?
Who stored sweet honey in words,
Wove arras of soft-colored sound,
Blew liquiscent notes as of birds
To bubble on surges profound?
Who freely gave all to a foe?
Who bartered his life for a rhyme?
Snared secrets of stars and of snow
And plundered the strong-room of Time/
Oh say is he duped by a dream?
By doubt of its why and its whence?
Consider the marvellous gleam,
The beauty, the hush intense!

Scrub Cattle.
THEIR breath is warm and sweet. It
holds the smell . ,
Of wind-blown grass and little fragrant
flowers; , , ,
Their supple knees have brushed the drowsy
Of dancing harebells as they wandered
through
Some little quiet sun-touched forest dell.
From dawn till dusk, through all the lovely
hours, , ,
These dwellers of the scrub tread free as
wind, .
Browsing the burnished blossoms of the
gorse. # . .
Or lingering down fair groves that end in
blind .
White tangled avenues of flowering box
Where the soft air blows warm and manna-
sweet *
And some still bolder than the others force
Narrow and twisted trails out for themselves
Through wild green ways, where ’neatli then-
questing feet
The fallen brown leaves whisper like bush
elves.
When thunder rolls its drums among the hills,
And purple clouds loom low, rich fold on fold,
The cattle call until the hot wind spills
Their wild deep-throated music far and far;
While at each flash of menacing keen gold
The sleek calves cower near the parent flank,
Their soft eyes grown dark with sudden
fright. , ,
The rain beats on the boles and splashes
down
On thigh and shoulder, trickling like dun
veins .
Down the warm hides, until the softer hair
Breaks into little curls of dusky brown.
Then .sullenly the thunder dies away,
The swift rain ceases, and, all sweet and
fair.
The wet pools in the grass glow like gold
stums *
The cattle move and sigh, then slowly stray
Upon their way again. The brindle cows
Crop the wet grass, or halt and patiently
Suckle their offspring with heads turned to
stare
At yellow sunshine laughing through
drenched boughs.
Then as dusk veils the glades in violet,
The cattle gather in some hollow there
Deep in the musk, and, lying close and still,
They chew their fragrant cuds that smell of
wet,
Crushed forest things ; while from a distant
hill
Ghostly, and thin as wisps of blue-grey
smoke
Blown from a witch’s fire, there comes a cry,
A poignant call that thrills into a sigh,
‘Mopoke! Mopoke!

Girl Song.
All day I work and save with might
To huy things for my Love’s delight—■
A string of beads, a brooch of jade,
A frock of palest gold brocade;
Slim shoes with little heels so high
They kiss the dance-floor like a sigh,
Till he who is my dearest love
Leans tenderly my head above
And whispers me, “I love you, Sweet,”
And folds me close to his heart’s beat.
Beyond these things of ecstasy
The drab day stretches back of me—
The desk o’er which my head is bent
In a meek semblance of content;
The typewriter whose maddening click
Hammers my nerves and makes me sick;
The frugal lunch of bread and cheese
That costs the least, yet can appease
Hunger of body and that longer
Hunger of spending which is stronger.
All day I work to earn for me
The toll Love asks imperiously—
Perfume for my marcelled tresses;
Posies for my old-world dresses;
Silken hose and underthings
Soft as butterfly’s gauze wings.
Thus am I gracious, brave and gay,
And glad to slave my youth away,
Repaid to hear him say: “My Sweet!”
And fold me close to his heart’s beat!

LOLA GORNALL.
Blue Wren.
When, to adorn the wide Australian sky,
The crew of Heaven in dungaree appeared.,
The merry cherubim no bos’n feared,
But, freely splashing color, all besmeared
Their humble garments with celestial dye.
Then, in the heights, gay laughter answered
jest,
And creaked the sky-hooks on the golden
rail
As brushes swept the morning washes pale,
And o’er them spread the dawn’s first crim-
son trail,
To wake the wonder in the sleeping west,
But soon the mighty canvas onward rolled ;
And now angelic pots were charged with
blue
That flung a glory o’er to far Yalgoo
From Terrigal; and many a kangaroo
Gazed up in awe at Heaven’s ship of gold.
One happy cherub set his stage a-swing,
Laughing to hear a kookaburra quaint,
Or turned his pot of bright celestial paint.
Swiftly he sobered and with neat restraint
Steadied the swaying lanyard with a wing.
One drop of heavenly blue, escaping, fell
Earthward through giddy depths of space;
So small, the east wind’s heavy swinging
mace
Left it unbroken, and the wispy grace
Of clouds let it pass through their white,
unfathomed well.
It fell upon a sober little wren
Whose only gaiety lay in an upturned tail;
It made of him a knight of Beauty’s grail,
A living spear of loveliness; though frail,
A brand of light to burst the sordid mail
That keeps out Wonder from the minds of
men.

Lightning.
LAMP of chaotic darkness of the prime,
Before whose flash God saw His own
white hand,
And knew Himself, and spoke His name to
Time
In wonder He alone could understand,
I look far out upon the shuddering night
And watch the sullen roll of cloud on
cloud
Split with your forks of death, while clap-
ping loud
Of phantom hands applauds. the sudden
light.
Thus, at the first leap of your bolted flame,
The airs and vapors of the vales of death
Clashed sound on sound, till the last Hell
became
Ten thousand years of echo, and the
breath
Of bellowing praise shook all the winds of
change.
Creation rose on that light-shattered
storm;
And angry color kissed the birth of form
That lived but in your wild empyreal range.
Harsh out of chaos, girdled with your fires,
Arose the red light of the burning suns,
Wheeled in the tempests of your fierce
desires,
Each on a maddened course of speed that
runs
From molten summer into icy pause
Of winter deeper than the sleep of God.
And ever on their flying path you trod
With searing whips to urge the Primal
Cause.
Bubbles of liquid fire, the worlds were
blown
Before the wind-lash of your eager stroke,
In showers of nebulous white radiance sown
Along the screaming ether, dense with
smoke.
The cool, grey ages took them in their care,
Soothed them with moulding change of
night and day,
With baptism of sweet rains and happy
play
Of musical long winds to make them fair.
And one of these is mine—O levin flame
That in the distance cleaves the rolling
cloud !
A pale light in star oceans of no name
Where gleam on gleam the cosmic wan-
derers crowd.
But there are rainbows spanning my green
hills
And thoughts that span the rainbow, and
the light
Of infinite far dreamings on the height
Of vision where the morning’s glory spills.
O jagged lightning of the primal sky.
How have we mastered your supernal fire,
Set it to music of our words that fly
On sparkling airs to tell our life’s desire!
You that had shaken chaos to the deeps
Must bond to serve the finger of a child;
You with the long red sun-whips tierce
and wild
Must light our quiet when a city sleeps!
Slave of our will, you bend to chattering
wheels
Or, tremulous as some blue homing bird,
Run down the far-spun wire where distance
heals
Her leagues of silence with the spoken
word.
We gather you in one white sweep of mind,
One magic hope of all fair things ful-
filled—
You the raw essence of wild force dis-
tilled
To the low murmurous spark that serves
our kind.

The First of the Month
BY BERNARD CRONIN
“I’M not altogether sure that I like it,” said
I Professor Janes. His thin voice wavered.
A “In fact, I don’t like it at all.”
The burly man seated beside him scoffed.
“Why not? It’s the best proposition we’ve
had since the talkies. Out and away the
best What’s the matter with it, Prof?”
Janes winced a little at the invincible
vulgarity of the speaker. He stroked his
lean jaws and his eyes made blank inquiry
of the darkened theatre.
"It’s too real, too lifelike altogether.
“Well, did you hear that?”
The burly man appealed to the third
member of the party which had iust wit-
nessed a pre-view of the first stereo-talkie
film to reach Australia. It was an American
production ; true to type, it spared no pains
to impress itself. As Professor Janes had
said, it was remarkably lifelike. But, of
course, that was the top-pote of the whole
invention. Everything else had been per-
fected long since—photography, sound syn-
chronisation, and so on. Only the flat per-
spective of the movies had to be overcome ;
now that, too, was an accomplished fact.
Their eyes had borne amazed witness.
As projected, the appearance of “Scar”
McGuire, speaking from Yard B of St.
Quentin State Penitentiary, while waiting the
day when he was to be, as the Stereo-Talkie
Film Corporation’s publicity hound had
bluntly expressed it in his boost, “turned off
in the chair,” was beyond doubt a master-
piece of realism. It conformed perfectly to
the three human dimensions.
The burly man, whose name was Shagreen,
was governing director of Southland Theatres,
Ltd., the largest and most enterprising cor-
poration of its kind in the Commonwealth.
The man to whom he turned now, half in
irritation half in amusement, was \V alter
Taddish, manager of the Enterprise Theatre,
where this technical revelation had taken
place.
Shagreen continued, lighting a cigar:
“Well, and isn’t realism what we want? If
you ask me, McGuire is the ‘short’
we’ve ever had. What do you say, Walter?”
Taddish laughed.
“That goes with me, too, Mr. Shagreen.
The thing’s a stark marvel. You could swear
it was McGuire in the flesh.”
“You hear that?” Shagreen demanded.
“Walter knows. He’s got his stop-watch on
the public pulse, and you can’t fool him.
That’s what he’s paid for; ain’t it, Walter?”
The Professor shrugged his shoulders. The
lights had gone up and the three men rose
to leave. Although it was summer the air
seemed suddenly to have grown chill. There
was a rankness about it, too, that he hadn’t
noticed before. He drew attention to it
petulantly.
“It’s as sweet as a nut,” Taddish said
resentfully. “I don’t know what you’re driv-
ing at. It’s the best ventilating system in
Melbourne.”
Janes sniffed doubtfully.
“I’ll take your word for it. Just now it
smelled like a —well, like a gaol. About
this picture, Shagreen ; what you say doesn’t
alter my opinion. It’s too real, too raw.
It’s abominable. The Censor won’t pass it.”
“ Won't he!” Shagreen said, with a hint of
truculence. “We’ll see about that. Now
look here, Janes. We’ve known each other
a long time; but business is business. I
asked you along this morning because you
said you wanted to study McGuire from the
—from the —what’s that damned word you
used ?”
“From the psychological aspect,” the Pro-
fessor said quietly.
“Exactly. Well, we made you welcome,
didn’t we? You don’t need to go around
running us down. We’re out to give people
what they want. And, you take it from me,
they’ll want McGuire once they get a sniff
of him.”
Taddish interjected, as they reached the
foyer. “Now just what did you expect to
find in McGuire, Professor?”
“What I found,” Janes retorted. He was
unmoved by their insolent amusement. “Don’t
you realise that McGuire is an abomination?
It’s an outrage to speak of such a creature
in human' terms. He isn’t human. He’s a
reversion to God knows what unspeakable
evolutionary type; a throw-back to the
primal beast of creation. . You propose to
affront an audience with that! .Mark me,
Shagreen, this persistent exploiting of the
morbidly horrible will one day bring retri-
bution. If I could I would destroy that pic-
ture.”
“As to that,” Taddish said, “it’s as well,
perhaps, that you can’t. For it’s the only
print there is. The original and every other
copy Avere destroyed. By accident, of course.”
Janeses look became alert.
“How do you mean —by accident?”
“You needn’t try to make a mystery out
of it,” Shagreen said, flicking the ash from
his cigar. “It was just like Walter says—
an accident. Result of a fire. It just hap-
pened.”
“Things don’t just happen,” the Professor
remarked. “But please yourself as to that.
How did this film manage to survive? And
how did you come by it? It’s been screened
in America?”
Shagreen grinned. “You’re wrong again,
Prof. This’ll be the first screenimr in-"the
world. See the big pull it gives us!”
“Then h0w”.... Janes began.
“Well, if you like, the Stereo crowd got
windy about it. It. seems there’s some sort
of superstition. They couldn’t account for
the fire. As if it mattered. Forget it.”
“Supposing,” the Professor asked from
the doorway, “yQU get a release, when do you
mean to show?”
“The first of the month,” Shagreen
snapped. His good humor, never apparent
for very long,, had deserted him.
The Professor took the tram back to his
Parkville lodgings. He was too pre-occupied
to notice the amused looks of his fellow-
passengers at the conductor’s purpling sug-
gestions that he pay his fare. Janes did
so mechanically. His faded eyes dwelt on
the faces opposite with an earnestness which
in another, less obviously of the scholastic
and therefore cranky type, must have given
offence.
He was thinking: “That s the whole gist
of it. Men and women look human. Ugly,
yes, some of them. Dirty, ill-minded
moronish, criminal; but human. That man
in front of me —he wouldn’t mind taking
my life. Less compunction than I would
have in killing a dog. But he’s my own kind.
The human ladder is a long one, and the
rungs broaden as they descend. But McGuire
isn’t on the ladder. He never was on it....
The first of the month—well, we shall see.
Ought I to get in touch with the authorities?
I wish I knew. Don’t want to be laughed
at; but McGuire Extraordinary dis-
covery. ... Lifelike !”
The pre-view of “Scar McGuire” had taken
place very early in the day, in order not to
interfere with the regular sessions at the
Enterprise Theatre, and the Professor had
not yet looked at the morning papers. He
was not due at lectures for some hours, so lie
was able to settle himself comfortably to
the news. Sardonically enough the first thing
to catch his eye was a cable from New York:
The execution of the notorious Scar McGuire will
take place at 7 a.m. on February 1, at St, Quentin
Penitentiary.
Following was a footnote: —
McGuire is said to be the most ferocious and in-
human murderer in the history of the- United States.
His victims include two women, killed in revolting
circumstances. McGuire, who has served a total of
15 years’ imprisonment for various offences, was
convicted by the Grand Jury in July last of the
murder of the two-year-old son of Byron J. Schwabb,
the Oregon broker. He was sentenced to the electric
chair.
Janes read this twice before the signifi-
cance of it occurred to him. He made a
A BUSY EVENING.
HE (peevishly) : “This is the first chance I’ve had this evening to see you alone, and now your young
brother comes spying on us.”
SHE (naively): “What! Is he there again?”
rapid calculation, aware of a growing dread
of something beyond reach of his ordinary
perceptions. Allowing for the difference in
longitude, it appeared that at almost the-
exact moment the stereo-talkie of McGuire
was being shown for the first time in
public, the man himself would be strapped
in the death chair thousands of miles away,
to be presently launched into Eternity.
The Professor, sensitive to the shock of
so ironic and disturbing a coincidence, cast
the paper from him as if he had been stung,
and sat some moments with his face buried
in his hands. The uncanniness of it appalled
him.
Pressure of work over the next few days
proved a blessed anodyne. But his disgust
and apprehension returned to him on meeting
Shagreen one day at the club. The great
man, his lips pouted about a fuming cigar,
smote Janes on the back with coarse
jocularity.
e iV J} ave y° u S°t over your grouch
yet.'' McGuire is set to break all records.
You 11 see what sort of a stunt we can do
when we like. W altcr’s got a lorry fixed
for driving around the city; believe me,
the other crowd will go sick when they
see it. There’s to be a barred cage, and
inside it a big orang-outang of a stevedore
dressed in prison stripes, with a face on him
that would frighten a bishop. Walter’s
sitting him in a chair with fake terminals
on his ankles and at the top of his ugly
skull, and a couple of Yank wardens stand-
ing alongside. I tell you it ought to go
over big.”
The Professor lusted to hit the fat,
grinning face lowered so triumphantly to
his own. The indecency of what w T as in-
tended brought a red mist to his eyes.
“Shagreen !”
“Well! Didn’t I tell you they’d put it
through? If ‘Scar McGuire’ ain’t an edu-
cational, then I’m no judge. The moral
effect will be tremendous.”
“For God’s sake, Shagreen, think what
you’re doing! It’s not too late even now
to drop it. Drop the whole thing, I mean.
Burn that film. It’s unclean ! That’s the
word —unclean ! It makes me afraid.”
Shagreen stared, then laughed.
“Easy, Janes; people are quizzing at
you. What! Not show McGuire? YouYe
cranky!”
“Listen, Shagreen. Do you know that
McGuire’s execution is timed almost for
the exact minute you’ll be showing his picture
in Melbourne? Did you know that? Can’t
you feel there’s something... .awful. .. .going
to happen!”
Shagreen broke through his stammering
with a whoop:
“You don’t mean that! By God, that’s
the touch we needed! Can’t you see the
posters! .The crowd will push the walls down
trying to get in. I must tell Walter.”
The Professor was left standing on the
footpath outside the club, one hand still
outstretched in hopeless appeal. He was
conscious that his face was white, and that
his whole body trembled. A young police-
man was eyeing him suspiciously. With an
effort he steadied himself and walked on.
But the nausea at the pit of his stomach
persisted. Shagreen didn’t know what he was
doing—couldn’t surely know what abomin-
able impiety he was planning. Money—
anything at all for money. Greed blinded
them.
Moistening dry lips, Janes seemed to recall
that McGuire had not moved with his back-
ground, but across it; as he himself might
have moved had he walked across the front
of the stage. Decidedly queer. He didn’t
attempt to deny the cleverness of it.. In-
ventive science seemingly had no limitations.
But the world was moving too fast, all the
same. There was something wrong about it.
The days fled. He wakened one morning
to the knowledge that the hour he dreaded
was at hand. He asked himself, in a for-
lorn attempt at self-ridicule, what it was that
he feared. People, he knew, were subject
to all sorts of unreal emotions and impulses.
They had hallucinations. Yet he felt that
this would not explain it. His sensations
seemed to reach him not from within, but
from without. From somewhere outside.
For the past week the Professor had deli-
berately avoided the city; but this had not
kept him from news of Shagreen’s enterprise.
The lorry, with its grotesque tableau, had
actually made an appearance in the city
.streets. He gathered, with shrinking ears,
that the triumph had been brief. When he
supposed that authority would be outraged,
he had not been mistaken. The stunt ended
abruptly. But the harm had been done.
People, it seemed, were agog with a vicious
curiosity. , ,
Shagreen was shrewd enough, iv here pub-
licity was concerned he allowed no _ oppor-
tunity to escape him. Janes, spreading the
newspaper by his breakfast plate, came upon
indignant headlines. Southland Theatres
were publicly protesting against wliat they
claimed was an unwarrantable interference.
.... And so on, and so on.
There was an interview with the govern-
ing director, Mr. Hector Shagreen, in which
the words “moral stimulus” appeared several
times. Mr. Shagreen claimed that Southland
Theatres’ .sole purpose was to educate the
public to an appreciation of spiritual issues.
“The Soul of Scar McGuire” was a beauti-
ful picture, apart altogether from the wonder
of its production. It portrayed a broken,
repentant man, in whose breast burned the
pure flame of the missionary. McGuire had
a message for the world, and it was his
Shagreen’s—duty to give that message; even
if, as he fully expected would be the case,
a good deal of money was lost in the ven-
ture. He denied that people had described
the street tableau as brutal and degrading.
Nobody in his senses would use such words
in connection with the portrayal of an old
man —he would venture to say, a dear old
man—pleading with youth to go straight.
McGuire was striving to warn
“Muck! What fearful muck!”
The Professor thrust
his plate aside. Clever
Shagreen—touching the
very heart of sentiment
with a dirty forefinger! It
was incredible that any
paper could be found to
print the stuff. It was
abominable.
It is the custom to
launch a new release at the
Saturday-morning session;
but in the case of “Scar
McGuire” the evening ses-
sion had been selected. The
departure, Janes told him-
self, was in itself sinister.
And yet how inevitable it
was! All the detail of
abo m i n able coincidence
rested upon this one seem-
ingly chance alteration.
Could evidence of its in-
fernal nature be plainer?
H'e decided he would not
join the audience, despite
the fact that his morning
mail included two compli-
mentary tickets from the
enthusiastic Shagreen. A
little note was attached.
Shagreen could be cun-
ningly offensive when he
chose. He suggested that
the Professor might care to
bring a lady friend. Women
were always interested in
spiritual values, especially
in the opposite sex. The
opening session had been
booked out days since, but
Shagreen wouldn’t have
felt happy if he hadn’t
reserved seats for his old
friends. And more to the
same effect.
The Professor’s impulse
was to tear up the tickets.
Instead he put them aside.
He had no intention of
using them, of course; but
they had a certain value as
a memento of —he didn’t
know what. A few hours
would determine it, one way
or the other. Yet, as the
day progressed, his deter-
mination weakened. He
could not deny that, psycho-
logically speaking, Mc-
Guire presented a rare
opportunity. It was pos-
sible that his friend Dr.
Slater, keen student of the
abnormal in man, would
welcome the seat. In the
end he rang Slater at the
University. The doctor was
frankly curious. He had
heard of the new process,
and he accepted the invita-
tion almost greedily.
The theatre was packed
when they entered. There
was, at all events, no fault
to be found with Sha-
green's publicity methods.
The waiting queues extended half-way down
the block in spite of numerous “House Full”
signs and the hoarse discouragements of the
gaudily-uniformed spruikers. The two friends
had almost to fight their way to the front
row of the circle. A “canned” orchestra
was playing the inevitable jazz. It did no-
thing towards soothing Janes’s wretchedness.
He was wishing to God he, hadn’t weakened
so stupidly.
But Dr. Slater had no such compunction.
His critical gaze took stock of his fellows
in much the way that he might have glanced
over the inhabitants of a zoo. When the
lights .sank and vanished, he leaned back in
his scat prepared to enjoy himself. He
didn’t affect entertainments of this kind
very often, and there was the touch of
novelty.
“Scar McGuire” did not appear until after
the interval. It was prefaced by a long rig-
marole —as the Professor contemptuously
styled it —explaining the origin of the new
and wonderful stereoscopic process, and the

ALIEN CORN
By G.M. Turnbull
Synopsis : Returning from sick leave,
Jim Huntley, Resident Magistrate of
Aikoroa, Papua, delivers a letter to
the dipsomaniacal owner of Nataroa
Plantation, Charlie Durrant, on whom
Huntley suspects Roger Calvert,
trader, is battening. It is from
Marian, Durrant’s young daughter,
whom Huntley met on shipboard
and has fallen in love with. It
tells her father that, as he had always
put her off when she wrote of return-
ing from “down south,” where she had
been brought up, she is paying him a
surprise visit. This news plunges
Durrant, icho had “gone native," into
despairing remorse. Bringing him to
the residency, Huntley grimly fights to
reclaim him for Marian’s sake.
Marian arrives from Baramata, but
Huntley has Durrant sober, and she
does not suspect his terrible weak-
ness. She too . stays at the residency,
the dilapidated house at Nataroa
having been burnt down, secretly, by
Huntley’s young assistant, Freddie
Chisholm. Huntley quells a native
uprising against the poll-tax. This he
knows, but cannot prove, was caused
by Calvert and Maragi the sorcerer.
Warned by Huntley to keep away
from Marian, who dislikes him, Cal-
vert boasts that everything she and
her father supposedly own is his.
Durrant admits he owes Calvert much
money—how much he has no record.
Durrant, rehabilitated, takes Marian
to the new house at Nataroa. Hunt-
ley tries to reconcile himself when
she calmly accepts Freddie’s devotion.
Saroni, Calvert’s native mistress, is
installed as Marian’s maid. Huntlen
wonders why Calvert is suddenly cast-
ing her and her child off. The n.-w.
monsoon brings heavy rain; Chisholm
is stricken with malaria.
CHAPTER XXI.
THE Maipua waddled in through the
reef, dropped the mail and a hetero-
geneous collection of crates and
packing cases, and waddled out again, dole-
fully tooting her siren.
Huntley swore with vigor and eloquence.
He would have liked a yarn with Captain
Fuller. The skipper was a courier from
the outer world; a messenger from a world
other than this abomination of rain and
mud. Still, he reflected, as he plodded
doggedly to the office, no shipmaster worth
his salt would attempt to load bagged copra
in the rain. Spontaneous combustion was
the danger, wasn’t it? What a hell of an
assortment of curious information he pos-
sessed !
The rain was pelting down in a devastat-
ing sheet so dense that he could scarcely
see through it. Soaking wet, he achieved
the office. There was a pool of water,
rapidly widening, on the floor. The papers
on the table were a sodden pulp. A shiver-
ing orderly, stripped to the buff, wielded
an ineffective mop, muttering bitter words.
Huntley glared at the leaking roof and
swore with feeling. He permitted himself
to think of his overdue leave, but Sydney
and the bright lights were too distant, too
remote to hold his irritated interest. He
concentrated his senses on the mail; the
complaints, the instructions, the impossible
demands of headquarters, and the six-
weeks’-old news of the outer world with
which he would inform his mind after
dinner. Provided, of course, that the news-
papers were not illegibly soaked, and he
could, find a dry spot in the residency.
Marian had hosts of friends on the other
side, he mused. Of both sexes, too, if he
was any judge of handwriting. He would
send her letters over by special runner. Her
parcels and things she must wait for. If
Chisholm’s improvement continued they
would have to think about cutting down
his quinine dosage. He was stone deaf
already, poor kid! Chisholm still had
correspondents in the F.M.S. Interesting
part of the globe, by gad! New Guinea
—without New Guinea’s naked rawness.
And Calvert, it seemed, was not unknown
in those parts. Huntley’s face darkened.
Automatically Calvert had arisen un-
heralded before him—grinning, leering,
knowing. Damn the fellow! He was be-
coming an obsession.
He had finished sorting the letters. The
rest of his Majesty’s mail could wait. He
tore the wrapper off a newspaper and sat
down. He swore. He was sitting in a
pool of water that, leaking through the roof,
had collected on his chair. A little stream
trickled icily down his back. Blasphemously
he asked himself if life could possibly hold
any further miseries. He could not remem-
ber when he had been so thoroughly fed up.
On the eighth day the deluge ceased.
Out of a clear sky the sun blazed down with
all its former brilliance. The rain-soaked
earth steamed; impalpable vapor masked
the jungle; the tiny rivulets in the garden
tinkled with a flute-like note ere the scorch-
ing sun sucked them dry.
All nature wore a joyful aspect; her
honeyed call was irresistible. Throbbing
bird-notes obsessed the air, shrill insect
choruses, the strident cries of humans re-
leased from bondage. Women hung out
drenched garments to dry; clouds of flam-
boyant butterflies appeared and fluttered
over the shrubs, and, in the treetops, birds
called and preened their gorgeous plumage.
The refrain of a generation-old musical-
comedy waltz was upon Huntley’s lips, an
unwonted exhilaration stirred his pulses as
he took his way to the office. He had an
absurd sense of freedom, of escape. For an
age, it seemed, he had been aching for a
glimpse of the sun, pining for the sweet
savor of growing things, yearning for the
feel of firm, sun-heated ground beneath his
feet, craving for underwear that was not
damp.
There was the draft of a letter upon his
table, expressed in terms of polished invec-
tive and devastating sarcasm. He grinned
as he read it. Into its composition he
had put his soul yesterday—or was it last
year? Its subject was the condition of the
residency roof. No fumbling there with
phrases adequate to express his wrath. But
it wouldn’t do. Decidedly it wouldn’t do.
He tried, and failed, to imagine the blister-
ing “Please explain” with which head-
quarters would smite him when the exqui-
sitely insulting phrases of his effusion pene-
trated the consciousness of the particular
Great One concerned with the roofs of resi-
dencies.
He tore the letter up. A pity. It was
great stuff; inspired stuff, by gad! But
one was under the necessity of earning one’s
living.
He sat down and slipped a sheet of paper
into his typewriter. He hesitated, frowned,
scratched his head. The typewriter began
to click. He smiled a little dubiously. He
was “having the honor to report” and he
was describing himself as “your obedient
servant.”
Down through a fretted canopy of palm-
fronds beams of sunlight danced through
the open window. A rare long-tailed dove,
all brown and green, fluttered with a whir
of soft-beating wings on the sill and was
gone. A smile curved Huntley’s lips as he
watched the tiny creature. From the ser-
geant’s quarters Loa’s shrill voice came to
him, upbraiding her riotous offspring, liken-
ing them to the sons and daughters of a
thousand devils. There was a cackling of
fowls, a hum of insects growing drowsier
and drowsier as the mounting sun climbed
high. Huntley relaxed, drawing long
breaths fragrant with the strong odor of
the earth.
The click of the door latch roused him.
The door opened and let in Chisholm. There
was no spring in the youngster’s stride; his
face was wan, his eyes dull. He shook his
head impatiently from time to time. There
was a singing in his ears, now loud, now
soft, as though a swarm of angry bees were
imprisoned in his skull.
Huntley regarded him with a frown.
“Young man,” he said severely, “are you
quite mad? You may sit down, you crim-
son ass, and get your breath. Then keep
out of this office until I give you leave.”
A rueful grin touched Chisholm’s mouth.
“I feel perfectly poisonous,” he confessed,
“but quite up to light duties, old chap. I
think I’ll turn to, if you don’t mind. You’ll
remember that I haven’t written up my
last patrol report—the '6ne I didn’t finish,
you know ”
“Stout fellow!” Huntley gently jeered,
but his eyes expressed approval. “Have a
smoke?”
Chisholm smothered an exclamation of
disgust. “My God, no! Tried one just
now and it tasted like chopped straw soaked
in kerosene.”
Huntley laughed. “As soon as you are
able to enjoy tobacco, then is the time to
talk about turning to,” he said. “Until then
you’ll do simply and promptly what I tell
you to do. Savee? Seriously, Chisholm,
you’ll have to take things easy for a week
or two. There’s no sense in holding this
infernal country too cheap. I’ve buried
many good blokes who did.” He took up
a sheaf of papers from his table. “See what
the mail blew in! Instructions from head-
quarters, marked pressing. Some office
humorist with a bent for statistics requires
a complete census of native-owned cocoa-
nut palms in the western district—with an
estimate of the probable copra yield during
the next five years. I ask you!”
“Splendid!” said Chisholm. “Just give
me a day or two to steady up on my pins
and I’m your man.”
“Like hell you are! It’ll be many a
long day before you’re up to hundred-mile
jaunts along the beach, my lad.”
At this moment a small boy sidled into
the room. He carried a stick, split at the
top. In the cleft an envelope was inserted.
Timidly he deposited his wand on Hunt-
ley’s table and fled. Huntley took out the
letter. The writing was small, even, neatly
spaced. The envelope exhaled an elusive
perfume.
“For you, Chisholm,” he said, and he
passed the letter over.
There was a growing expression of delight
on Chisholm’s face as he read; a faint
color came into his cheeks, his eyes laughed.
Huntley watched him with grim amusement.
"How are the folks at Nataroa?” he
inquired.
The pink tinge on Chisholm’s face flared
into a definite blush.
“Fine,” he answered. “They are—er—
that is, Marian is concerned about my
health. I’m not a hopeless crock, am I?
She wants me to go and stay with them
for a while—rest up, you know—convalesce
—and all that sort of thing.”
“Why not?” Huntley’s voice was deter-
minedly matter-of-fact. “The idea has
everything to commend it. You’ve been
pretty sick, son. A week or two at Nataroa
would buck you up no end.” He looked at
Chisholm with his quiet smile. “Accept
at once, young feller, and be grateful for
the gifts the gods are showering upon you.”
“But I say, It.M., I couldn’t walk out on
you in that way! Work in arrears and more
piling up every day. I couldn’t think of it.”
“If you imagine for a moment that you’re
indispensable to me, laddie,” Huntley in-
formed him succinctly, “that settles it—
absolutely.” He stood up and came over
to Chisholm. “I’ll be eternally darned if
I’m going to leave you on the station alone,
Chisholm. You may not know it, but you
require looking after. It’ll be a comfort
to me to know that, while I’m counting
cocoanuts for the funny bloke at Port
Moresby, you’ll be in competent hands at
Nataroa.”
“You’re most devilishly decent about it,
R.M. I feel that I’ve let you down—crock-
ing up in this dam’ silly way.”
“That’s all right. Chisholm,” Huntley re-
turned gruffly. “Send a chit to Marian and
tell her you’ll be over in the whaler bright
and early to-morrow. It’s far better foi
you to have a quiet spell in cheerful sur-
roundings than to get three months’ sick
leave hurled at you later on. Now, for the
love of Allah, get back to the house, like
a good fellow, and give me a chance to
chew over the administrative details of this
most damnable division.”
Through the window he watched Chis-
holm threading his way through the trees.
Chisholm knew what he wanted. And,
knowing, went for it with both hands.
Youth with its splendidly adventurous
vision! Youth, with its hopes, its dreams,
its faiths! Huntley’s lips contracted a
little. He jabbed his pen into the ink and
began to write.
From outside, sounds of the bush blew
in. A vagrant breeze sluggishly stirred the
foliage of the trees. A thin twitter of birds
—timid, reed-like—and, somewhere, a native
voice, raucous, untuneful, singing “Onward,
Christian Soldiers,” in Motuan.
With painstaking detail Huntley wrote
up the station journal—neglected for a week
or more—referring to his diary, checking
dates, blotting each entry with meticulous
care. And, as he worked, his mind was
separated from his task by as immense
a distance as stretches between the earth
and the stars. It wa.s a direct hint from
destiny, this invitation to Nataroa. If, be-
fore, he had doubted, he knew now with
certainty where Marian’s heart was given.
He could see her welcoming her lover with
pretty eagerness. He could see Chisholm,
clean and wholesome as a sea breeze, hold-
ing her hands, smiling into her eyes. He
wondered now at the turmoil of resentment
that had swayed him when first he had seen
them together—like that. Odd that he felt
no pain now—no sense of loss. It was amus-
ing, really, that he should be playing fairy
godfather to them—and enjoying the role.
His pen was no longer recording the dry
facts of station routine. He was looking
with empty eyes into empty space, thinking
of the nameless something, like a rare per-
fume, which Marian’s presence had brought
into the raw sordidness of Aikoroa Bay.
The western patrol marched out when the
sky to the east was mother of pearl with
the faint stirring of dawn. There was a
week’s tramp along the beach for Huntley
and his men; and Huntley, like all old cam-
paigners, preferred to cover as much ground
as possible before the insatiable sungods
made of walking an arduous task.
The jungle, mysterious and glamorous,
was on his right, backed by the • hills sil-
houetted in sombre green against the sky.
To the left was the lagoon, dotted with the
dun-hued sails of canoes drifting in from
the fishing grounds on the reef. Huntley’s
pipe was drawing comfortably, the air had
a tang to it, the carriers were in fine fettle,
the police full of vim. It was patrolling
under conditions that approached the ideal.
Huntley was a man of few fancies.
Nevertheless, as the days slipped by, he
liked to think of Freddie Chisholm digging
himself in at Nataroa. And, as he ate his
solitary dinners on the verandah of some
village resthouse, he liked to think of that
other bungalow a hundred-odd miles to the
east. There were lights there, not the thin
radiance splashed by a hurricane lantern on
a goru-palm wall, but soft candle lights, red-
shaded, flickering on silver and glass. There
was soft music at Nataroa, merry chatter,
music. Those kids!
The days passed into weeks. Time was
not the essence of Huntley’s contract. He
spent his days marking off irregularly
planted palm-groves into ordered squares,
counting trees, estimating their ages, ascer-
taining their ownership; his nights in work-
ing up the data he had collected.
Nearly a month elapsed before he felt
justified in returning to the station.
He made the long trek back in easy
stages, holding court here, setting tasks
there, commending village constables, re-
primanding them, disciplining Stone Age
men who knew not the meaning of the
word. And in this fashion, pleasurably
fatigued, pleasurably conscious of a job
accomplished, he came back to Aikoroa.
CHAPTER XXII.
From the moment he returned to the
station, from the moment he gripped Chis-
holm s hand and commented upon his
obviously improved health, Huntley had a
disquieting sense of something gone wrong.
Actually there was nothing in Chisholm’s
demeanor that obtruded itself; nothing tan-
gible that one could seize upon, nothing
definite that one could interpret to mean
anything at all; but under his amusing irre-
sponsibility lay an undertone of restraint,
of unease. Indubitably a subtle change
had stolen over Freddie Chisholm during
the month Huntley had been absent on
patrol. It manifested itself in many baffl-
ing ways, and, watching him, Huntley was
perplexed. Chisholm was no reader; yet
it was not like him to leave a dozen late
sporting papers unopened. He was no
sparkling conversationalist; yet, usually, it
was not, hard to keep him in talk on any
subject under the sun. He was no profound
thinker; but now his air was that of a
man whose mind is occupied with matters of
very great importance indeed.
One night, soon after his return, Huntley
was stretched in a long chair on the
verandah. Chisholm, hands in pockets, a
cigarette dangling from his underlip, was
leaning against a verandah post, staring
into space. All the evening he had been
restless, fidgety. He could not sit down for
long, nor remain standing for long either.
He complained bitterly of the nuptial
swarms of flying-ants that crawled over his
person, shedding their wings; he slapped at
mosquitoes, smoked innumerable cigarettes
and mooned around with a staring expres-
sion in his eyes and a compressed look about
the mouth.
Puzzled and a little uneasy, Huntley
watched him covertly. It was long before
comprehension came. Then Huntley smiled
at his own obtuseness. He whistled with
immense and secret satisfaction; loud and
long he chuckled to himself. There had
been a tiff, of course. A lovers’ quarrel, a
sure and certain sign of how things had been
shaping themselves during Chisholm’s con-
valescence at Nataroa. Huntley slapped his
thigh. His perspicacity brought a glow- of
pride to his eyes.
Gently he rallied Chisholm with whimsi-
cal good-humor. “I say, laddie,” he began
“why don’t you do the fair thing?”
“What say, R.M.?” Startled, Chisholm
swung round.
“Don’t you think it’s up to you to make
the first move?”
Chisholm jerked his head up. He winced.
Clearly he was in a peculiar state of nerves
and mind. The aftermath of his bout of
fever. Huntley decided. It affected fellows
in all sorts of curious ways.
“Say it again, R.M.,” Chisholm was
saying; “I’m a bit thick in the bean to-
night.”
Huntley looked at him quizzically. “Don’t
be a God-forsaken ass,” he said; “I’m not
blind.” Then, with a thoughtless assur-
ance: “Haven’t you any of the gentler
qualities at all? Or are you too darned
much of a cave man to make the first
move?” He gave a laugh with a suggestion
of self-consciousness in it. Chisholm’s face
remained blank. “Tell her it’s all your fault.
Be a ‘less-than-the-dust’ laddie. Kiss the
lass and make it up. There’s the devil of
a kick in it, I believe.”
He was aware that Chisholm was staring
at him in an odd sort of way. His mouth
opened and then closed tightly. His eyes
blinked. Then a sudden light flashed across
his face and he laughed nervously, doubt-
fully and wholly without mirth.
“Kiss and make up!” he repeated. “Oh,
my sacred aunt!” He faced Huntley
squarely. “You’ve got it all wrong, old
chap. You’re off the bally rails completely.
I mean, IVe—er—that is, I’m” he broke
off, floundering.
“What the deuce do you mean, Chis-
holm?”
Chisholm shrugged and his face grew
moody again. “Oh, hell!” he swore. He
swallowed. “It’s quite true that IVe con-
trived to offend Marian—but, where the
devil did you get that kissing and making-
up stuff, anyway?”
“Come on, son. I’m all ears.”
Chisholm’s face expressed an acute dis-
comfort. “I was brought up in the wrong
school, I fancy, R.M. Makes a fellow
aggressive and overbearing and intolerant
and all that sort of thing. Honestly, old
chap, I’ve tried to make a point to be polite
atid—and decent; but it is not a bit of use.
I can’t pull him on at any price, and I’m
jolly well not going to try.”
An emotion between consternation and
bewilderment tickled Huntley’s spine. He
shivered as though the humid tropic night
held a chill. He would have staked his
life, everything he possessed Automati-
cally his feet swung to the floor as his mind
leapt to a sickening conclusion.
“You mean Durrant?” he questioned with
dismay in his voice. “He has broken out


again? Gone off the deep end on one of his
filthy benders? Is that it, Chisholm?”
Impatiently, vehemently, Chisholm made
denial. “The old man is all right,” he
growled. “Quite all right. It’s Charlie
Durrant’s cobber I could most cheerfully
throttle.”
Huntley gave a quick start. A puzzled
expression came over his face. Then realisa-
tion smote him and again he felt a sensa-
tion of chill.
“The fellow simply haunts Nataroa,”
Chisholm went on in a disgusted voice.
“The old man and he are as thick as
thieves. It’s absolutely revolting.”
“You’re referring to Calvert?”
“To whom else? I’m prejudiced against
the blighter, I admit. All my traditions
or instincts or whatever you like to call
’em are ranged solidly against him and his
breed. I can’t help it, old chap. I’ve tried
to savee Durrant’s attitude, but it’s got
me beat. It’s not a bit of good, R.M. I
can put up with Calvert if I have to, but
only in homoeopathic doses. And that’s flat
and final.”
Huntley’s mouth was set in a tight line.
He was seriously disturbed, remembering the
parlous state of Charlie Durrant’s finances;
but to Chisholm he showed an impassive
face.
“Charlie is debt-ridden,” he said with all
the deliberation he could command. “He
has to be decent to Calvert —even if there
Were no such things as ordinary business
courtesies.”
“Yes? I seem to have heard something
about all that.”
“Well?”
Chisholm choked. “Good God, R.M.!” he
exploded. “Calvert strolls into Durrant’s
house in the manner of one accustomed to
being there and assured of a welcome.
Indeed, he conveys all over his person the
idea that my presence there is an infernally
impertinent intrusion. To me the fellow is
insufferable, impossible in any social rela-
tion. I tell you, I sweated with rage all
the time I was at Nataroa.”
Huntley’s face was stony. “And so you
did a bunk?” he asked bitterly.
“Not a bit of it!” Chisholm violently
answered. “Not on your life! I declared a
truce and made a tactical retreat —after
Marian had ticked me off good and hard.
But I haven’t finished. Not by a damned
sight!”
He lapsed again into moody silence. Hunt-
ley wondered what was going on in his mind.
It struck him as enormously significant
that, except for his one brief outburst, Chis-
holm had not mentioned Marian. His own
outraged sensibilities seemed to possess him
utterly. It was the conventional attitude
of mind, Huntley reflected, a sort of
superiority complex; the aggressively in-
tolerant, ruthlessly cruel reaction of the
conventional white man to the “tar brush.”
To Freddie Chisholm, Calvert could be
nothing but a colored person aping his
betters; a quite impossible bounder, to be
accepted on sufferance in official or busi-
ness relations and thereafter blandly
ignored; a fellow one instinctively avoided
like the plague, something quite outside
the calculation of a pukka white man.
Roger Calvert was a “damned chee-chee”
—and that was the sum and substance of
Freddie’s philosophy.
A poor sort of creed when one came dis-
passionately to analyse it, Huntley mused;
indefensible on any ground, moral or scien-
tific. They were never given a chance,
these casual mischances of white men’s lust
and brown women’s indifference. From
birth the dice were loaded against them ;
from birth they were hopelessly handi-
capped, crushed between two irresistible
forces. Scorned by the white man, despised
by the brown, small wonder that they grew
up to loathe their native mother and curse
the name of the father who begat them!
But there it was, the uncompromising,
unmerciful Nordic creed, rejected only by
bat-eyed idealists and outcast renegades.
A shrug, a sneer for the man who mixes
his blood with a darker strain; a social
lazarette for the innocent offspring of such
unhallowed unions. An unctuous creed,
a Pharisaical, holier-than-thou, monstrously
indefensible creed. But upon it rests the
whole fabric of the white man’s civilisation
Huntley found himself eyeing Chisholm
almost with stealth. Freddie and his kind
enacted strict laws for the conduct of
society. Between his world and Calvert’s
was a bridgeless chasm, and Freddie’s sense
of fitness had been outraged, his sensibili-
ties jarred because that “damned chee-chee”
had evinced a blatant desire to cross it.
That was all. Freddie was seeing himself
as a symbol of racial and social superiority
before whom Calvert, the outsider, had re-
fused to give to be overawed, ignored
or resolutely thrust aside as Freddie’s code
demanded. That was why Freddie writhed
and seethed and fidgeted. Mortification of
pride and a galling sense of disgust! The
blind young fool!
Huntley gave a loud cough.
“Eh?” Chisholm exclaimed.
“I didn’t speak,” Huntley gruffly re-
turned.
He had been tempted to show him Cal-
vert as he, Huntley, saw him. But Chis-
holm would think he was crazy. As perhaps
he was.
Had Chisholm’s ruffled dignity blinded
him to everything else? Could he see in
Calvert only a colored bounder with ridicu-
lous social pretensions? Couldn’t he recog-
nise the fellow for what he was —a crafty
Oriental, dangerous, unscrupulous —narrow-
ing, covetous eyes, licking hungry lips before
Marian’s fresh young beauty? Marian Dur-
rant was a radiant being beyond Calvert’s
grasp; an elusive vision of the unattain-
able to him or the likes of him. The un-
attainable? The mangiest village cur can
sink claw and tooth into the breast of
the most exquisite dove if the bird chances
to come within its reach. The death-adder,
lurking in the undergrowth, needs only to
be brushed by heedless feet and its hideous
coils tauten like an uncoiled spring.
There was a chill in Huntley’s bones. His
face was set like flint. He was certain
beyond doubt that he was not being hag-
ridden by a preposterous idea; certain
beyond doubt that Maid Marian stood de-
fenceless and in imminent peril at Nata-
roa.
“I have something to say to you, Freddie.
You’re hellishly self-sure and cocky and
casual. Don’t overdo it, son.” He coughed
uncertainly. “What you’ve been telling me
—about Calvert, I mean—has got me a
trifle rattled. He is a dangerous fellow,
Freddie.”
Chisholm stirred. His arms rose in a
stretch. He yawned.
“You can’t tell me anything about the
swine I don’t know, R.M. I’m on to him,
I assure you.” He turned a speculative eye
on Huntley. “In fact, old lad, I’m not
sure that I couldn’t tell you things about
him that would astonish you.” His mouth
opened in a cavernous yawn. “It’s bed for
me, R.M. Excuse me? ’Night!”
A fierce urgency that would not be
denied drove Huntley to Nataroa next day.
He had no plan, nor had he laid down any
course of action for himself. He was con-
scious only of a sense of nerve-racking
apprehension, of pitiful inadequacy, a
guilty awareness of having left Marian in
the lurch.
His long legs ate up the miles. The
scenery failed to arouse in him any emotion
of pleasure; the throbbing resonance of the
changeless sea, the song of bird life, the
brooding mystery of the jungle impinged
not on his consciousness. He saw only
a gallant little figure, neat and trim and
slender, reaching out for a friend she
desperately needed.
Gloom enveloped Jim Huntley like a
cloud.
He slowed down as he neared the bun-
galow. The new nipa-thatch on the roof
gleamed dully in the sunlight. The trim
aspect of homeliness, of comfort, impressed
him. His feet made no sound upon the
soft turf that girdled the house. Marian’s
garden was making a brave show now —
neat, carefully tended and ablaze with
color.
He lifted the gate-latch, and then stood
still.
It was Marian’s voice, high, tremulous,
almost hysterical.
“No, no! Not yet! I insist—please!”
There was the sound of a scuffle, a
smothered exclamation. Then a man’s
voice, smoothly caressing, with a sugges-
tion of exaggerated sibilants about it.
“Have no fear. I am very patient.
Always I shall be very patient and thought-
ful for you, little Marian.”
“I know. But please, oh, please!”
Huntley’s heart seemed to miss a beat,
but his reaction to Marian’s wail was auto-
matic. He was up the steps in two quick
bounds. When he reached the verandah,
he stopped short, taking in the tableau that
confronted him. Calvert, a thin smile of
mastery on his face, was standing by
Marian’s side. There was a sort of shrink-
ing horror on the girl’s face. Pluntleyknew
that she had been held a prisoner by the
wrist, that only his unexpected interven-
tion had released her.
His face paled with anger. “What is
going on here?” he demanded thickly.
“Has this fellow been annoying you,
Marian?”
Marian colored violently; then, almost
immediately, she was white. “Wh-why,
Jim!” she faltered. Her voice strengthened
a little. “Why—why—of course not, you silly
old lamb. Wh-what an extraordinary
fancy!”
Then she threw back her head and
laughed. Huntley did not like the sound
of it.
Calvert slicked back his glossy hair with
a beringed hand. He presented an aspect
of polite though bored interest. His eyes,
dark, watchful, missed nothing.
Huntley felt baffled, rebuffed. He had a
frightening sense of something from which
he was being deliberately excluded. De-
terminedly he kept his glance on Marian’s
face, ignoring Calvert. The dread seemed
to lift from her eyes; her mouth trembled
in a smile infinitely pathetic.
“Won’t you sit down, Jim?” It was
astonishing how quickly she had recovered
her poise; but her face might have been
modelled in wax it was so colorless, so
devoid of expression. “So good of you to
come, Jim—in this awful heat. We are
waiting for tea. Won’t you join us, Jim?”
There was an inarticulate sound from
Huntley. She was being polite to him!
Playing the hostess called upon to entertain
an unexpected visitor! He stared at her
searchingly. She gave him look for look,
meeting his eyes defiantly. But Huntley
felt he had caught something which she had
not meant to be seen. There was a subtle
something behind her magnificent assur-
ance, something that affected him un-
pleasantly. His little pal was frightened
out of her wits!
“You’ll smoke, Jim? Do let me take
your helmet. It’s delightful to see you
again, dear old boy,” she rattled on breath-
lessly. “Dear me, Saroni is becoming fright-
fully lackadaisical! I can’t think what is
coming over the girl. Do you people mind
if I go to the kitchen and hurry her along?”
Huntley muttered something. He
watched her sombrely as she went away.
Something of the lithe vigor, the quick
vitality had gone out of her movements.
Even her straight young back expressed
dejection, weariness.
He turned upon Calvert. “I wish to speak
to Miss Durrant,” he said levelly. “I wish
to speak to her alone. Do you take me?”
“No, I’m afraid I don’t, Huntley,” Cal-
vert laughed softly. “Perhaps I do not
choose to —er —take you.”
“I’m asking you—telling you to clear.”
Calvert’s white teeth gleamed. He did
not seem to be in the least offended, or
even discouraged.
“A habit of yours, I remember,”' he
drawled. “A rather monotonous habit, may
I say? When I’m prepared to take orders
from you, Huntley, I’ll let you know. Until
then, hold your tongue.”
There was menace in his dark and nar-
rowed eyes; his face wore a dull flush; his
full, red lips were sneering.
Huntley tapped him upon the chest with
an extended forefinger. “I fear you don’t
understand. I’m sure you would not wish
to involve me in a course of action that
would be most distasteful to me.” He
spoke quietly, evenly, without emotion of
any kind. “I have canons and obligations
I try to hold to. I’m remembering them
now; but I swear to God that if you’re
in this house when Miss Durrant returns,
here in her presence, Calvert, I’ll give you
the thrashing of your life.”
With studied indifference he lighted a
cigarette and sat down with his back to
Calvert.
“You take a devil of a lot upon yourself,
don’t you? Who the dickens do you”
“That’ll do,” Huntley tossed over his
shoulder.
A chair scraped on the floor. Huntley
turned his head. There was a gleam of
unbridled fury in Calvert’s eyes. Mechani-
cally Huntley braced himself to meet the
blow he felt was coming. For a second
Calvert stood trembling. And then:
“God’s curse on you, Huntley, for the
great hulking bully you are!”
Huntley looked up. Calvert had gone.
The rattling of the tea things and
Marian’s approaching footsteps brought no
lightening of Huntley’s spirits. There were
shadows about her eyes, her face impressed
him as cold, austere. He stood up, taking
both her hands in his. The touch of her
fingers chilled him.
“Where is Mi*. Calvert, Jim?” she asked
in a small, slightly-retarded voice.
“He has been called away—urgently. His
business was very pressing.”
Huntley achieved a laugh that was in-
tended to be reassuring; but, surprisedly,
she drew aAvay from him, avei’ting her head.
There was something so disturbing in her
demeanor that he placed a hJnd under
her chin and tilted it gently forward.
“Tell me all about it, Maid Marian.
What is it that is distressing you so much,
child?”
Her eyes were wide with pain, her face
was drawn, her mouth unnaturally tight-
ened.
“I know everything, Jim, dear. All the
squalor of it and the —the beastliness. None
of the details has been spared me.” She
shook away the tears that gathered in her
eyes. “Life’s an awful muddle, Jim. It’s
frightfully difficult. Oh, dear, you’ve been
everything that’s fine and splendid and—
and loyal.” Resolutely she controlled her
tremulous voice, gallantly she lifted her
quivering face. “I didn’t savee, Jim, dear;
but I’m glad you played up; glad you tried
to spare me. I’m glad, I tell you. I thought
everything was going splendidly. Daddy
was rich, respected, prosperous. He spoiled
me, Jim, denied me nothing. And I in my
cold-hearted selfishness accepted it all as a
matter of course; not knowing that all the
time daddy was making a ghastly shipwreck
of his life.”
“That is over and done with, Marian,”
Huntley muttered. “New Guinea tried your
father sorely. He has suffered terribly ; but
he has triumphed splendidly. Now he is
his own man again, his own master. We are
proud of him, child.”
It w r as better, a thousand times better,
that she should have made the discovery.
Innocence that sprang from ignorance was
no sort of shield for Marian Durrant. He
perceived the futility of trying to comfort
her with words. She had been hurt desper-
ately, poor kid, and she must be given time
to recover. An idea came to him.
“You need a complete change, Marian.
A change of scene and a change of interests.
Mrs. Marchmont would love to have you at
Baramata. You know how often she has
pressed you to pay her a visit.”
Marian shook her head. “I can’t, Jim.
I just can’t,” she quavered. She shook with
an ague of helplessness. He saw panic
deepening in her eyes. “Don’t you under-
stand, Jim, that—that”
“I’ll speak to your dad about getting you
away by the Maipua the day after to-
morrow,” Huntley cut in briskly. “Seri-
ously, my dear kid, you need a change. You
need it badly.” He smiled at her in gentle
raillery. “You were not quite honest with
me just now, were you? Not quite frank?
I do not blame you; but you must not, you
simply cannot be exposed to the risk of
insult again. Confess, now, wasn’t that
bounder Calvert trying to—to paw you?”
She clung to his hand as though she were
a little girl afraid of the dark.
“Dear Jim, you’re making it hard for me;
so very hard.” There was a choke in her
voice that was almost a sob. “You and
Freddie, both of you, making it so hard!
Don’t spoil everything by being stupid and
—and horrid and jealous.”,
“Jealous! What in the name of God”
he broke off helplessly.
There came the sound of bare feet pad-
ding on the floor, a rattle of crockery.
Marian pushed her hands against his chest,
beating them frantically against it.
“Go away, Jim!” she wailed. “Please go.
Can’t you understand” He waited for
her to go on, and a peculiar panic assailed
him. “Can’t you understand that I’m going
to m-marry Mr. Calvert?”
Huntley had a sense of the world rocking
under his feet. He seized her shoulders, held
her out and stared, stared, stared into her
widened eyes.. She tore herself free, hur-
riedly wheeled, and, as she fled, he heard
her strangled sobs.
Saroni was methodically arranging the
tea tray. She looked up at Huntley. Her
eyes were dilated, flaming with a tumult ot'
murderous, implacable hate.
For a while Huntley stood rooted, gaping
at the door through which she had dis-
appeared, consternation holding him rigid.
She was going to marry Calvert— marry
him! The words kept repeating themselves
in his mind, beating upon his brain in a
maddening rhythm.
“Tea, Taubada.” A sulky voice cut in
on him. “You like tea, Taubada?”
Sullen of mien, sombre of eye, Saroni
hovered about the tea tray.
“No!” Huntley exploded, glaring at her.
Immediately he repented of his harsh-
ness. There was something pitiful about the
girl, something of a whipped dog atmo-
sphere.
“No, Saroni,” he said in an altered voice.
“No tea, my girl.”'
Married to that brindled ruffian! So this
was the cross Marian had taken up; the
curse, rather, that had been laid upon her!
With a great effort of his will he fought
off the surge of white-hot anger that
threatened to engulf him. The mere know-
ledge that Calvert had been permitted to .
insinuate himself into Marian’s society had
weighed damnably upon his mind and
spirit. The mere knowledge that she had
been subjected to such slight contact with
human swinishness had been revolting to
him. Good God! He had come to Nataroa
half determined to tell her all that he knew
and a little of what he thought of Calvert;
to warn her—if it was necessary to his peace
of mind to assume a mantle of priggishngss
—that no decent woman, white, browir or
brindle, was safe with Roger Calvert. And
she, white and proud and unspotted as
virgin snow, was going to lower herself to
his pariah level! To marry him! It was
an abominable inversion of all the decencies.
Charlie Durrant must have slid far down
the hill of depravity if his was the mind
that had conceived such infamy. After all,
it was one way of paying his debts. De-
liberately Huntley played with the thought,
then thrust it resolutely from him. Charlie
Durrant was a weakling; he had been every-
thing that white men are not; but he was
no party to this most foul compact. He
was not so far sunk in worthlessness as to
condemn his adored, fearless little daughter
to be the legal plaything of a damned
white Kaffir; he was not so shameless as
to buy his own security at the price of his
baby’s soul.
A suffocating sense of unwilling admi-
ration swept through Huntley. A strange
warmth stirred within him. Not for nothing
had Nature given Marian her proud little
head and her undaunted eyes. She was
not all knees and lipstick, plucked eyebrows
and perilous heels, slang and casual kisses.
It was in her to make of self-sacrifice the
supreme satisfaction; the passion to give, a
devouring hunger. It Was in her to crucify
her flesh and her spirit to preserve the
serenity of her father’s days; to martyr
herself for an ideal of playing the game.
Jim Huntley was seeing her with a new
clarity, running a gamut of emotions that
left him awed, wondering.
But it must be stopped, of course, this
final act of lunacy. Even if it meant an
overseer’s monthly pittance for Charlie
Durrant and a typist’s desk for Marian;
even if it meant eviction from Nataroa and
an end to Marian’s dreams, it must -be
stopped. But how? There must be some-
thing that one could do. But what?
(To be continued newt week.)
To My Heart.
OMY heart, what would you cherish,
Store and keep against the years
If the roses fade and perish,
If the joy dissolves in tears?
What of summer’s light and laughter
Can you carry to the cold,
Sad and silent days hereafter?
What of youth when you are old?
While you dream the dream is over.
As you kiss upon that breath
You are parted from your lover,
She has kept a tryst with Death.
While you run the race is ended,
Laurels fallen to the dust.
Fight, the cause is undefended
And the blade is dark with rust.
All your pride and vaunt must measure
At the end this common grave.
Heed and hoard no more vain treasure.
But, D my heart, be brave!

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Melbourne horses are showing signs of over-
racing. At Moonee Valley there were 15
runners in the Maiden Handicap and 14 in
the Argyle Highweight, but other fields were
small. Only three competed in the Koom-
bahla Handicap, a mile contest for three-
year-olds. Moonee Valley club is following
the example of the V.R.C. in catering for
thoroughbreds of that age, but owners are
unappreciative. Iskander, a colt by Eastern
Monarch from Charlecote, by Charlemagne
11., justified his odds-on favoritism by de-
feating Rhyon by nearly a length. J. E.
Smedley, who did well with Black Duchess
when in Sydney, supplied the other runner,
Maniple. Iskander belongs to C. W.
Leonard, a Melbourne sharebroker. The
creditable showing made by Rhyon speaks
well for her sire, Raron, by Valais out of a
sister to Poitrel. On the turf, when trained
by Scobie, Raron impressed by his compact-
ness and general air of quality.
Pat Nailon did no good with Banner Boy
as a jumper during his spring visit to Mel-
bourne, and did not bother to take the
gelding back to Sydney. Banner Boy was
sold to a patron of the Flemington stable of
Ted Fisher. Produced for the Kalkallo Trial
Hurdle at the Valley, the son of Some Boy
11. ruled favorite until supplanted at the
last moment by Varquador, bred by J. H.
Lienkop, president of the Bendigo Jockey
Club. In Lienhop’s colors Varquador scored
four times in as many starts at provincial
fixtures. He has not settled down to the
little-sticks game yet, and was a long way

out of his ground half a mile from home on
Saturday, but finished third. Banner Boy;
shaped disappointingly. Bright Prince —
whose dam, Bright Maid, won an Australian
Steeplechase—scored by half a head from the
St. Anton prad Stanford,
An impost of close on lOst. did not pre-
vent King Mart appropriating the middle-
distance Laluma Handicap. He started at
5 to 1 in a field of seven, favorite being
Farlure (9 to 4), with Lord Whittier at
3 to 1. Fact of Farlure not having been in
solid work for more than a week did not
worry the owner-trainer, Ned O’Dwyer, as
the gelding is clean-winded. In one of his
rare galloping humors, Quick Reward made
the running and secured a break on . the
field, with Farlure and King Mart in the
extreme rear. Farlure warmed up sooner
than King Mart and led into the straight
on terms with Loquacity. They were having
a ding-dong go when King Mart made his
appearance on the scene, winning by a length.
Ted Fisher landed the Kiata Handicap with
Zanibar, and supplied a hot favorite for the
Highweight Handicap in Carnadine, whose
chance was ruined by early interference.
Race went to the rank outsider Auriga, who
had suffered reverses in provincial events.
Ascot, one of the Melbourne “pony”
courses, will have the field to itself in the
Victorian metropolitan area next Saturday.
This arises from an Act for the restriction
of racing passed by the Argyle Ministry.
It is now a case of the lamb and the lion
side by side, V.R.C. horses being free to
compete on the courses of the V.T. and R.A.
and rice verm. Ascot is endeavoring to rise
to the occasion by erecting a new grandstand
and administrative buildings.

Celtic, winner of the Rosehill Corinthian
Cup last year, was not destined to be the
means of adding the trophy presented by the
White Horse whisky people (it is valued at
250 guineas) to E. J. Watt’s sideboard. He
was favorite, at threes, but the weight (12st.
101 b.) proved too much, though he looks big
enough to carry a ton. He did not even get
a place. Ethics (5 to 1), specially reserved
for this race (he was taken out of the
Carlingford Mile) and nicely handled by A.
Campbell, an amateur from Coonamble,
settled his nine opponents in comfortable
style; Hampton Plane and Alberic proved
the best of them at the weights. Ethics
is a three-year-old brother to Magnetic, and
is above the ordinary.
Lady O’Clare, a mare trained at Canter-
bury Park by Carl Scott, her owner, gave
McShortodds a skinner in the Dundas Ilan-
decap. Her ring price was 33 to 1, but it
was only nominal; on the tote (Rosehill
sticks to the out-of-date 60-20-20 p.c. sys-
tem) her div. was £l7 19s. 6d. for 10s. She
was thought to be racing out of her class,
for the field included Pentheus (favorite),
Casque d’Or (5 to 1), Cathmar (8 to 1),
Burracootboo and other Villiers candidates;
but only Cathmar gave her any trouble, and
he was beaten by half a length; Old Ming
(6 lo 1) was a close third, and Pentheus
fourth. Burracootboo faded after being
among the leaders to the and seems
to have had enough racing for a while.
Gemlight (9 to 4) had too much pace for
the other starters in the December Handi-
cap. Salvador (14 to 1) and Talkie (5 to
1) made the finish interesting, but Bartle
kept Gemlight going and at the end his neck
was in front of Eurythmic’s erratic brother.
Gemlight runs his best races at Rosehill, and
so does My Talisman, winner of the Carling-
ford Mile", at eights, from Ring Boy and
Alienor. My Talisman gave Webster his
second successful ride for the day—the
Maoriland lad had got N.E.F. (evens) home
in the Nursery Handicap,

Phar Lap’s name appears among the
entries for the Agua Caliente Handicap of
100,000 dollars which is to be run in the
Mexican township next year, and his oppo-
uents include the pick of American racing
stock. The chestnut will leave M.L.
for ’Frisco at the end of the month, and
will go to Mexico immediately on landing, if
all be well. The race is a mile and a quarter
on a loam track. So far the best time
recorded is 2min. 3 l-ssec. Phar Lap holds
the M.L. and Australian record for the dis-
tance with 2min. 2£sec., but it is stated that
the dirt tracks of America are slower than
the Australian turf. As to weights, America’s
best, handicapper, Sun Beau, topped the list
with 9st. 31b. last year. Phar Lap is not
likely to carry more than that.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
At Rushcutter Bay on Saturday night
another programme at “popular” prices
drew another poor gate. The contest between
Joe Poland (10.5) and Tommy Gibbs
(10.8) was a torrid affair, and Poland showed
promise in winning on points. Billy Cooper
(9.2) drew with Young Heency (8.121).
For the second time since its inception, 23
years ago, the Sydney Stadium is to. put up

but bad matchmaking has helped.

Tom Lurich (14.5) wrestled Walter
Browning (14.3) in the opening match ot
the 1931-32 season at Leichhardt Stadium
last Friday, and these mastodons of the mat
made merry as usual. Browning, wrestling
while his opponent indulged in the rough
stuff, gained the first fall in the fourth with
a toe-hold. The buffoonery afterwards be-
came a bit tedious, until Lunch evened the
score with a figure-four body-scissors m the
sixth. Browning did not come up again.
The Ins and Outs
The South Africans met trouble in their
three-day match with a country side at
Newcastle, Hooker playing havoc with the
early batsmen. A useful stand by Cameron
(62) and Dalton (77) improved matters,
and lefthander Steyn, playing his_ first game
in this country, batted well for 50 n. 0., the
score reaching 248. Hooker took 6 for 84,
and his bowling and the 'keeping of the
Wagga player Sadlier were the outstanding
features of the innings. Brown (5 for 57)
proved a problem for the home batsmen with
his right-hand length stuff. R. Robinson, a
16-year-old Novocastrian, showed promise in
compiling 32. The visitors scored more freely
in their second knock, Cameron, helped by a
couple of lives, banging up 129 in 83
minutes until he went to a splendid long-
field catch by Hutchins just before stumps
on Saturday, when the score was 289 for 4
wickets. They closed at that, and their
bowlers soon polished off the countrymen.
“Five Ways”: Oldfield's recent batting
stand in the Brisbane Test, which gave
Bradman a chance to rattle up the runs,
was followed by another useful contribution
in the same cause in the second N.S.W.
match against South Africa in Sydney. A
lot of folk have overlooked the fact that
Oldfield went into the A.I.F. Eleven as a
batsman. Long being the first ’keeper, and
frequently opened the innings with Herbert
Collins, finishing up fourth in the batting
averages.
$ $ *
“Old Trafford”: The late Dr. Leslie
Poidevin (B. 25/11/’3l), who will be best
remembered in N.S.W. for his unfailing
encouragement of colt cricket, had a re-
markable cricket career during his stay in
England. He played for Lancashire in no
less than 99 matches, scoring over 4000
runs. In all, he scored 11 centuries in
County cricket, eight of them for Lan-
cashire and the others for London County.
During his eight years in England he played
212 innings in first-class cricket for an
average of 30.72.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: Cricket schools continue
to flourish in England, most of them featur-
ing both indoor and outdoor wickets for
use, as the weather and the season demand.
One of the best known of them, at Walham
Green, London, has been closed since _ the
tragic death of the founder, South African
Aubrey Faulkner, whose magnificent all-
round cricket took Australia by storm when
he was here with the last Springbok side.
It has just been reopened, however, and
the manager will be Major K. L. Nielioll.
whom Australians will recall as Governor-
General Stonehaven's military secretary and
a cricketer of some class in private matches.
* * * *
“Ride Off”: There was something of a
wrangle on a Sydney cricket ground the
other day when a ball hit high in the air
shed its cover. A fieldsman caught the
latter and the question rose as to whether
the batsman was out. A similar happening
in India led to a new rule in polo. In a
game between the Durham Light Infantry, a
famous polo side once upon a time, and the
9th Lancers the ball split in front of the
Lancers’ goal. The back cleared the larger
half, but a Durham player following up fast
whacked the other section through the posts
and claimed the goal. There was a fine
tamasha then, and, as has been said, a
rule was evolved providing for such con-
tingencies.
* * *
“Gabba”: One of the numerous experts
sent up by the Sydney press to report the
Test at Brisbane raised his voice in a
dolorous howl because the big crowd tore
down many of the pickets in the boundary
fence in order to see the game better. The
superior person remarked that this showed
a shocking lack of appreciation of the dig-
nity which should attach to a Test, and
implied that this was to be seen at its best
in Sydney. Writer can recall one instance,
at any rate, when the Sydney nobility and
gentry temporarily mislaid the caste of Vere
de Vere. It was during a match with one of
Stoddart’s teams in the ’nineties. There was
then a cement cycling-track round the ground,
and someone, bored with the proceedings,
threw an empty beer-bottle on to it. In
a moment the air was thick with a barrage
of bottles, it being a hot and thirsty day, and
soon the shattered glass sliding down the
slope fringed the edge of the grass with an
ugly-looking barrier which the outfieldsmen
took care to respect.
Dr. R. L. Raymond, who recently took his
departure for England, where he will be
attached to the Royal x\ir Force as a medico,
went from Sydney University to Oxford
as a Rhodes scholar and there built up a
big reputation as a Rugby three-quarter, get-
ting his Blue and being selected for Eng-
land, though an injury prevented him play-
ing. “Pup” had previously shown fine form
for N.S.W. in Australia against the visiting
Springboks and Maorilanders. Though he
lias been out of the game for some time the
big fellow intends to take it. up again, pro-
bably with his old club, Blackheath, which
has been a home from home to so many Aus-
tralian exiles in England.
:): * * *
“Hotham”: Bendigo Rowing Club some
time ago announced its intention of cycling
to Sydney en masse to row at some of the
Harbor City regattas. Details have now been
■finalised, and some 30 members will ride,
carrying camping equipment and keeping
themselves on the way. The start will be
made in February next, and Sydney will be
reached in time for the oarsmen to compete
in the Balmain, Drummoyne and Glebe
regatta on March 5. A. Cambridge, who won
the Australian sculling championship in
1925, lias organised the tour and will be the
guiding spirit.
!, * * *
“Bias”: Australian bowlers are very much
annoyed with their Maoriland confreres, and
if the latter don’t look out someone will be
catching a smack on the wrist. It was noted
when the Shivery Isles bowlers were in Bris-
bane that they delivered with one foot off the
mat. The Australian player has to keep both
feet on the mat, even if the latter is not big
enough for both of them at a time, as not
infrequently occurs. Further, the standard
draw of a wood in Australia must be *»ft. 9jn.
in a 90ft. run; in M.L. it is only 4ft. 9m.
Thus the All Black gets the benefit of much
straighter woods. .

The Ins and Outs
The South Africans have had a bad spin
with the weather, which has interfered with
nearly every match they have played in
Australia. The second game against N.S.W.
was no exception, intermittent rain inter-
rupting the visitors’ reply to the 500 total of
N.S.W. in the first innings, most of which
came from Bradman’s knock for 219, though
Hird (101) and Hunt (45) later took ad-
vantage of the greasy ball and the easy wet
wicket to some purpose, McMillan, though
heavily punished at times, ended up with
0 for 189 off 23 overs—a fine performance
under the conditions in the closing stages of
the N.S.W., innings. In between rain squalls,
South Africa lost Christy’s wicket, and then
Curnow (81 n. 0.) and Morkel (70 n. 0.)
brought up 185, when the match was aban-
doned. Morkel’s hard-driving knock was very
attractive, and given decent luck he is likely
to shake our bowling up. The N.S.W.
trundling can only be described as pathetic.
* * ❖ *
“Tenth Slip”: The two N.S.W. matches
against the South Africans have rammed
home the fact that without Bradman and
McCabe the side is third-rate as a batting
proposition, while the best that can be said
of the bowling is that it is well up to vacant-
allotment form. In the absence of Bradman,
McCabe, Oldfield and co. in the second Test,
the State side for the South is mostly made
up of men unknown to big cricket. They
are probably all the better for that, and
should make the most of the chance given
them. They are O’Reilly, Salmon, Lea-
beater, Nutt and Donnelly. Salmon and
Donnelly. are left-hand batsmen, while
O’Reilly is a really good right-hand leg-break
bowler. Nutt and Leabeater are right-hand
batsmen, the latter a very fine field.
* * * *
“Jolimont” : Richmond cricket club, which
brought young Allsopp over from N.S.W.
after the N.S.W. selectors had jettisoned
the very promising country batsman-wicket-
keeper, are feeling pleased with themselves.
In his opening match Allsopp scored 64 in
short order, later catching and stumping
four of the opposing batsmen. It is more
than likely the youngster may find a place
in the Cabbage Garden team shortly. Vic-
toria is looking for a capable stumper, and
one that can make runs in addition will be
doubly valuable.
* * * *
After an interval due to the South African
tour. Sheffield cricket has been resumed, the
matches opening this week-end being South
Australia y. N.S.W. at Adelaide, and Queens-
land v. Victoria at Melbourne. Queensland
is the only State with ranks undepleted by
withdrawals for the second Test in Sydney
against South Africa, and the Northerners
have a really formidable bowling side. If
they can only pull their fielding together,
and bat up to their true form, both Victoria
and South Australia will find them a tough
proposition. They are the only State side
trying to encourage the country players,
several of whom are in the team, though
Victoria has selected a man from Bendigo, J.
Thomas, who is only 21. Thomas, who is a
left-hand batsman, shaped well against the
English team of 1929, making 63. Nagel,
who has been bowling so well for Victoria,
is also a product of the goldfield.
* * * *
The South African tour of Maoriland has
now been fixed up. The Maorilanders have
been asked to guarantee £l2OO, and only
three matches will be played—a Test at Well-
ington and games against the Provinces at
Christchurch and Auckland. The Spring-
boks will be fully represented with the ex-
ception of Steyn. This player, who has
figured in only one match to date, cannot get
extended leave and will return to Capetown
ahead of his comrades on February 9.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: There is a certain amount of
mystery about the dismissal of professional
bowler Dick Tyldesley from the Lancashire
team. Richard, who was in Australia with
Gilligan’s team in 1924-25, was E. A. Mac-
donald’s opposite number in the Lancashire
side, for years, the slows of one effectively
setting off the express stuff of the other.
Richard seems to have sinned by asking for
higher ‘wages, but though he recanted, the
enraged committee threw him out. It recalls
the historical Crossland row of long ago,
when that eccentric individual was ordered
off Old Trafford and heaved out of the
Lancashire county side. His sin was swear-
ing at his captain, A. N. Hornby, when the
latter told him to bowl instead of throwing.
In the ’eighties that sort of thing was a
little less than high treason.
Racquet and Bawl
“Kooyong”: Victorian tennis-players
shrieked when Jack Crawford was soundly
walloped by his erstwhile N.S.W. cobber
Harry Ilopman in the Victorian champion-
ships, but there was a positive hullabaloo
when Mrs. C., like Jack an Australian
championship holder, was beaten in straight
sets by Mrs. Robertson. To those with
short memories it may be mentioned that
Mrs. R. was Esna Boyd, the Victorienne who
w r on the national championship in 1926
and was Daphne Akhurst’s most formidable
rival in Australia. The lady married abroad
and has been living for some years in Scot-
land. She is a forcing player, excelling in
volleying.
* * * $
“Cash Amateur”: The N.S.W. tennis
heads are realising that the exorbitant prices
it is proposed to charge for admission to the
Sydney matches of the Japanese players will
result in poor attendances, and have asked
the people in Melbourne for a scale-down.
Instead of 2s. 6d., ss. 6d. and 7s. 6d., the
Ma Staters want a cut to is. 3d. and 35., the
7s. 6d. to remain, since only a limited number
of these seats will be reserved for the silver-
tails, half of whom will be deadheads, any-
way. When one can see international cricket
for half a crown, even the proposed reduc-
tions seem inflated, taking value for money
into consideration.
* * :)l *
“Sturt”: Beyond doubt a record in tennis
is a recent match played by Miss May Parr,
the first woman champion of S.A. in 1892,
and standing alone in earlier years before
championships existed. At 68 she still plays
a sound game, and in this club match she
met, in two hard sets, a girl 51 years her
junior.
“Hotham”: Norman Brookes gave his
audience a bit of news at the dinner
to the inter-State tennis-players in Mel-
bourne last week when he announced that
he had arranged the visit of the Japanese
team by contracting that this country would
send a side to Japan. A Davis Cup team may
go overseas this season, but that should not
bar the way to picking a strong side to visit
Nippon.. There is a great young entry com-
ing on in Australia, and the Japanese trip
is just the thing to bring it on in its game.
The Nineteenth Hole
‘‘Takapuna”: The craze for golf in Maori-
land exceeds even the Australian obsession
for the royal and thirsty game, and new
clubs are springing up like mushrooms in a
single night. A notable instance is the new
North Shore club at Auckland, which began
its existence last May on a few paddocks
of an abandoned farm. Eight months later
a full and complete course of 18 holes was
in full swing and membership totalled 371.
❖ * 5jC
“Sandringham”: Harry Williams, the
young Victorian and Australian amateur
champion, is not going to rush his attempt
on f the British golf championships (B.
2/12/’3l). He proposes to put in at least
another year in Australia topping up his
game, before going overseas. So keen is he
on his future prospects that recently, on
learning that a position he held in a sport-
ing-goods shop was an infringement of his
amateur. status, he resigned—'and people
think twice about throwing up a steady job
in these days. The rules of the amateur
championship bar any player w T ho. because
of his skill as a golfer, receives a salary or
remuneration from any firm dealing in goods
relating to the playing of the game.
* * & *
“Nerang”: Southport, a Queensland
watering-place between Brisbane and the
N. S. Wales border, boasts among its attrac-
tions a golf . club which is remarkable
for a scheme it has originated for making
members take a keen interest in the organi-
sation. Each hole and the fairway leading
thereto are placed under the care of one of
the members. A special plant nursery and
turf area has been installed, to which the
trustee may resort for material to'replenish
ms charge.. No mention is made of the
Nineteenth in this regard, but one can easily
understand that replenishment and main-
tenance there would be too big a job for any
one man, especially in view of the fact that
the club is staging a special invitation
tournament during Christmas week.
* * * *
“Carnoustie”: One of the latest steps in
golf is the formation of a reciprocal golf
society, which intends to bring about the
affiliation of all golf clubs throughout
Britain. The cable which announces the
launching of the scheme, does not say where
it originated. As one of its main features,
however, is a proposition that visiting
players who are bona fide members of golf
clubs will be able to play free on every
course in Britain on payment of a fee of
10s. 6d. per annum, I have no hesitation in
saying that the idea emanated from one of
my own countrymen. The only drawback
seems to be that, in order to get full value
for one’s ten and saxpence, one would have to
travel, and that means train fares and so
on. There’s a catch in everything.
*•*
“Hoylake” : .The opening of the Addington
Golf Club, which is situated on the outskirts
of London, was responsible for one of the
biggest knockbacks to the Blue Ribbon
movement which Britain can chronicle.
Players came from far and wide to take
part in the ceremony. There was the
natural sound of revelry always attendant
on such occasions, but when the scouts
came pouring in with the news that
three players had holed in one during the
initiatory round, the Nineteenth went wide
open. When it was all over, one of the
folk who had to set them up, E. M. Cesares,
a member of the Stoke Pogis Club, might
have been forgiven if he had revised Gray’s
famous Elegy, for whatever golfing Mil-
tons were about were not mute or inglorious
—in their own estimation—but far other-
wise.
* * * *
“The McHaggis”: Every community is
familiar with the household to which the toil-
worn husband wends his weary way at
close of day, only to find a note pinned to
the tablecloth saying that his spouse has
gone to the links, and will he please get his
dinner from the tin of sardines in the safe
which was opened last Wednesday? If the
annual report of the English Ladies’ Golf
Union is to be trusted the clouds are lower-
ing increasingly on our housetops. The
report says women , golfers are increasing
“by leaps and bounds”; clubs report up
to 60 per cent, increases in membership,
seven out of ten of the new members being
married women. That is not the worst,
according to the report. The average woman
golfer, it says, doesn’t bother to go home
after a game and see to the dinner. Instead
she telephones her husband to come out to
her club and dine with her there. Anyone
so unfortunate as to have acquired a first-hand
knowledge of the cuisine in fem&ine clubs
will be able to grasp the full horror of the
situation for husbands.

“Der Jong”: One of the attractions or
otherwise of the Jinja golf course, which
flanks the Nile, in Kenya, not far from its
source, have been the local hippopotami,
which delight, to wander on the fairways at
night and leave footprints varying "from
3in. to 6in. in depth and 12in. or so in
diameter. A local rule permits lifting out of
these pits without penalty, but club members
are now wondering what rule can bo evolved
to meet the latest situation to develop.
Lately a bridge has be.en thrown over the
Nile just above Jinja. Up to that time, the
hippopotami and the crocodiles were the
worst the golfers had to face. But with
the coming of tho bridge, lions, which
swarm in the bush on the other side of the
river, have taken to coming across to investi-
gate. The other day a family party of six
was found camping comfortably under a
shady tree near one of the greens and hot
discussion as to the proper procedure has
followed. Perhaps “The McHaggis” will
give us a ruling. Law 11 as to the removal
of obstructions seems difficult of application
in this case.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: Norman Smith and his retinue
were received with civic honors on arriving
in Auckland last week. It is now definitely
settled that he will make the attempt early
in January on some fine morning when wind,
sand and tide are just right, and the sea-
gulls—a real source of danger, these—are
not yet on the job. Smith will first tackle
the 10-mile and 10-kilometre records, and
then the five miles and five kilometres. After
that, the big attempt on the world’s record
for the flying mile will be made. Smith is
supremely confident of hoisting new figures.
Running conditions, he says, are far better
than Malcolm Campbell experienced, while
his car has 84 per cent, less head resistance
than the Englishman’s.
' Haeremai” : Don Harkness, who designed
and built the chassis of Smith’s machine, has
been telling an Auckland interviewer that
the jigger has cost all of £15,000 for the
chassis alone. A guarantee of £3OOO had
jnwf . on British Air Force engine,
£OOO of this being retained to pay costs of'
overhaul when the engine returns to England.
Tyres and wheels cost £l2OO, and spare parts
malun S total construction costs close
to £21,000. The transport charges, travelling
and maintenance costs for the crew and
mechanics, and running afid repair costs for
the car must be added. Some £3OOO has been
spent on a garage on the beach, and £5OO on
the purchase of the electrical timing appara-
tus-all confirmation of the old adage that
(record) time is money.

“Corniche”: The Monte Carlo rally, in
which an Australian' team of cars is to take
part, finishes oil January 20. Competi-
tors select their own starting-point from
a list compiled by the Monte Carlo club. All
starters must pass through specified controls
on their way to the mount, and must arrive
on time at all points and at the finish to
escape the k.o. Speed average for big cars
j s 24.8 m.p.h., the minimum for “smalls”
a . a ? some °f the routes are over
2000 miles in a European winter the test
is a thorough one. The winner in each class
is the driver who maintains schedule, checks
m correctly, and covers the greatest mileage.
Cars finishing have also to pass an exam, for
mechanical defects, brake efficiency, etc.
There were 120 competitors in last year’s
events, won by two Britons, D. Healey and
V. Leverett.
* * * *
“H.C.”: All over the world strenuous en-
deavors are being made to find a substitute
tor petrol, and a recent demonstration in
France has emphasised this. The tests were
under Government control and the fuels were
as various as the types of cars. Two had
compression ignition engines (Diesel type)
burning peanut oil! Others ran on fuel oil
and mixtures, including one of benzol, petrol
and coal oil. One was driven on compressed
illuminating gas ; two had producer-gas plants,
one using wood charcoal and the other plain
wood. Great success is reported to have
attended the use of illuminating gas com-
pressed by a new process, and further trials
are to be made with it.
* * * *
“Kick Starter”: J. S. Wright (B.
9/12/31) has been trying to beat his own
world s record for motor-cycle speed, this
time on the famous cement road at Tat, in
Hungary. He met with bad luck, for after
doing a one-way run at 163.8 m.p.h., his
engine seized, and he was unable to make
the return trip necessary to complete the
record. The time, however, is almost 13 miles
better than his previous best, so he must
have been moving.
Miscellaneous
“Rat-tail”: Most coursing men are fami-
liar with the classic story of the man who
gave his dog a leg of mutton to ensure his
running stiff, in a course, and saw the tyke
surrender his mpal, which was promptly
eaten by the other dog in the slips when
the slipper’s attention was wandering.
Something of the sort happened in Sydnej
just before the tin hares put up the shutters.
One owner, excited at the thought that his
tyke would wiu, couldn’t eat his tea,
and got out to the track as quickly as
he could for the race. To his horror, the
dog, after going well, shut up like a jack-
knife and was badly beaten. Going home
in disgust the owner threw himself into a
chair and announced he would have the
steak-and-kidney pie he had spurned some
hours previously. “Too late,” said his spouse
in astonishment. “When you wouldn’t eat
it, I gave it to the dog, poor starved thing!"
■** * *
“Spike”: Though M.L. was keen to get
Jim Carlton over for a tour of the chief
centres early in the new year, James has
turned the proposition down. He will be
wanted for the National Games in Melbourne,
which begin on January 30, and the N.S.W.
championships early in February; after that
he will need at least three months for the
Los Angeles trip, for which he picks him-
self.
* * * *
“Blade”: It seems about time the Vic-
torian rowing authorities selected some other
venue for the inter-State eight-oar race for
the. King’s Cup when it comes their way.
This year the big event will have to be
reduced from 3 miles to because the
building of a new bridge across the lower
Yarra makes it impossible for crews to pass
under without risk of accident. In any
case the Yarra, with its sharp turns, is
far too narrow for a race of this im-
portance when there is a full entry from all
six States. It isn’t that Victoria cannot
find suitable water elsewhere; the trouble is
that the canalised drain through Melbourne
is ideally situated for drawing fat gates.
* * # *
“Stretcher”: Sydney rowing men got a
first-hand taste of the blessings of Lang
legislation last week, when the question
arose of transporting rowing shells from
Sydney to Penrith for the regatta on the
Nepean River. In the past the custom
has been to transfer the long and delicate
craft by motor-lorry at periods when the
traffic on the mountain road is negligible.
On this occasion, however, oarsmen had to go
hat in hand to the Transport Board for per-
mission. This was graciously accorded,
exemptions from the tax per ton per mile
and per passenger being also permitted. The
lorries used, however, must be registered
under the Act, no “black” wheels, so to
speak, being permitted.

The classic Rugby match between Oxford
and Cambridge was played at Twickenham
last week, the Dark Blues winning by two
tries and a dropped goal (10 points)' to a
try (3). The chief factor in the Oxford
victory was the magnificent form of the
Sydney Uni. and N.S.VV. scrum-half “Butts”
Lamport, who outclassed his mates and the
opposition both in attack and defence. Two
M.L. players, Minns and Henley, the latter
a last year’s Blue, did great work in the
fine forward team fielded by the winners.
One solitary Maorilander, 11. B. Johnstone,
figured on the Light Blue side. Lamport was
the first scrum-half selected for the Wara-
tahs; but could not make the tour, Malcolm
getting his place. It is probable he will
follow in the footsteps of C. G. Wade, Sam
Woods, Johnny Wallace, C. Forsayth and
other Australians, and win his international
cap overseas. This is the 56th inter-uni.
match, Oxford having won 25 and Cam-
bridge 21, while 10 games have been drawn.

“The Gaffer” : When are Britain and the
Dominions going to fall into line with other
athletic nations and measure their athletic
distances and field-game performances in terms
of metres? America certainly clings to the
old yards and feet in some cases, but the
metrical system is being very widely adopted
for all forms of sport. The U.S.A. has at any
rate given up the equally foolish method of
computing weights of boxers, wrestlers, etc.,
in confusing stones and pounds.

THE
BANKS!
The banks of Australia belong to the
people who have put their money in them.
The Communist-minded politicians do not
own the banks, yet they want to control
them —to use your money for their own
political ends.
If the politicians interfere with the banks,
the people will take their money out of
them.
Then there would be no banks, no
stability, and no credit for the home
builder or the business man.
The soundness of Australia to-day,
despite the devastating conditions which
the Commonwealth has endured, is due to
the strength and the conservative policy
of the Australian banking institutions.
Since the depression, only two banks have
suspended payment in Australia. One of
these—the New South Wales Government
Savings Bank—was due entirely to whole-
sale withdrawals of money by depositors
who feared political interference by Com-
munist-minded politicians.
The safe, sound methods of Australian
banks to-day are saving the Common-
wealth, saving you, saving your job, your
home, and in fact, your future.
The Scullin, Theodore, Lang groups are
determined to manipulate the Australian
banks for their own political ends. There
is only one way to stop such disastrous
and criminal legislation.

This Letter, roaming among the highways
and byways of Christmas shopping, came
twice upon the unexpected. In one very
correct little shop a demure dollie bore the
legend: “I take off my clothes —4s. 6d.”
And in the corner of a big store she heard
one small woman shrill to another: “An
he's got a job as Santer; but —would you
believe it, Mrs. Simmons? —every blessed
night when he comes home I’ve gotter mend
his red twill trousers. Owing to him being
stout, and them being tight, he busts them
every day a-leaning down to hear the kids
whisper what they want in their Christmas
stockings!”
Well, the Balokovics have lived up to the
tradition set by other private yacht-owners
who have sailed into Port Jackson. They
have given Sydney something to talk about
—like the Speejacks party, though most of
that thrill came after the little ship had
passed from our horizon. Mrs. Balokoyic,
described by her friends as a woman with
a will of steel, had a hit of a dust-up with
Captain Paul, who commanded the yacht
on her voyage from America. The lady
insists she is captain, and whatever master
mariner is in charge is but the sailing
master. So Captain Paul departed for Eng-
land by the Esperance Bay, and his friend
the doctor of the yacht’s company has gone
with him. Now Commander Benriott has
taken Captain Paul’s place, and will lead
the Northern Light home to the Americas
by way of the Barrier Reef and Java.
The Streeton show in the National Gal-
lery draws a curiously mixed crowd of art-
lovers. Last Sunday there were groups of
Chinese and Japanese (the latter with the
inevitable camera) ; there were men of Italy
and two girls at least from France. The
Centre Court seems to swing on a wave of
lotus blue, so much of this melting dream-
color streams from the pictures on its walls.
1 low industrious Arthur Streeton has been!
Screens have had to be put in to accom-
modate the compositions, great and small;
and whether the scene be mountain, sea or
plain, it displays the same attention to
detail —there are no unpeopled spaces in a
ca nvas by Streeton; and this obser-
vation of grass and leaf and shrub was
strongly developed by his old teacher. Tom
Roberts. The public, even when it doesn’t
understand art, senses this, and last Sun-
day “Still Glides the Stream” (which
Streeton declares is his best work) and
“The Land of the Golden Fleece” were never
without a group two and three deep. The
artist’s own house, with a mulberry-tree in
front of it, was another point of interest.
Still, all the people who called at the gal-
lery weren’t there to look at Streetons.
Groups of small slight men, eyes bright in
black faces, walked in and out without a
glance at the Australian’s work. An atten-
dant told this Letter that their quest was
the painting of Sheba by Sir Edward
Poynter. These men are Ethiopians, arid
whenever a ship comes in with them aboard
they rush up to pay respects to their Queen
Mother. Sometimes one will be found wait-
ing for the gallery to open; sometimes they
come up apparently straight from the
engine-room, a piece of waste in the hand.
Still two other visitors to the gallery on
Sunday were intent on Royalty. An excited
small girl and boy rushed in: “Please,
Mister, can you tell us where to find the
King and Queen!”
Dr. Beatrice Sharwood’s wedding to Dr.
John Holt did not take place at Canberra’s
first cathedral, after all, the building being
still in too great a state of incompleteness.
The guests went along to the Fawkner-
street kirk, instead, to see Dr. John Walker
tic- the knot. Never before had the little
street, held so many motor-cars. Dr.
Beatrice wore a frock of pale-green georg-
ette and a little bowler liat to match. The
'maids were Beryl Jones and the ’groom’s
sister Edna.
’Berra is not to be left without a lady
doc. Moya Blackall, who for a couple of
years has been helping her dad, Dr. Pat,
cure the sick of Queanbeyan, is hanging out
her nameplate in the city.
This will go down in woman’s history as
the trousered season. Pyjamas for beach
and general knock-about wear flap their long
dismal legs on extension-hangers. In the
showrooms there are enough pyjamas to
emphasise the curves of the entire crop of
Christmas belles. These towelling- and
dimity- and gingham-legged garments, so gay
when doing their job, look as depressed as
a flattened balloon when not filled with leg.
Women of sterner stuff, of course, have made
one leap into the flannel trousers this Letter
foreshadowed weeks ago. In grey, royal blue
and cream, topped by a boy’s shirt, they
adorn slim waxen ladies in the surfing
departments, they lurk around corners amid
the sports wear, and o-n the small flesh-and
blood sylph they are most attractive. They
have none of that flapping clothes-line atmo-
sphere the beach pyjama is apt to get.
A friend of the Andersons tells this Letter
that Sir Allan, father of the young man who
is to marry Morna MacCormick, is one of
the most magnetic men of his acquaintance.
American papers described him as one
of the most picturesque and striking
personalities at the conference of the Inter-
national Chambers of Commerce in Washing-
ton. He is 54, looks no. more than 40, still
keeps up his interest in rowing and swim-
ming. He is a director of the Bank of Eng-
land. of the Suez Canal Co., and the London,
Midland and Scottish Railway. His mother,
Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, was the first
woman in England to take the degree of
M.D. A sister. Edith Garrett Anderson, was
in Australia two or three years ago and was
much feted by the women doctors.
Mrs. Bertie Kelly, according to report,
will arrive in Sydney soon after Christmas.
She has grown placidly handsome, and, is
proud of her son-in-law, Gualtiero Volterra,
who is already a pianist of renown in Europe
and London.- His family is one of the
oldest in Florence and is well known in the
art world. It will be remembered he mar-
ried Patricia Kelly; she is reported to he
busy translating “San Michele” into Italian.
The nice girl in the artist’s smoek is

The sky burned blue above the wedding
of Grace, only daughter of Banjo Paterson;
for Grace married Lieut. Harvie, of
H.M.A.S. Australia, in a garden—the
beautiful garden around Dame Eadith
Walker’s home. The two stood under a
great golden parasol smothered in pink
roses, and behind Padre A. O. Ilardie, of
Vaucluse, who heard the vows, was a sort
of Druid semi-circle of six-foot-higli gold
pedestal baskets in which rose-trees bloomed.
Below, the irises and cacti in the sunken
garden caught the ardent sun, and on the
rising ground the wedding finery of 150
guests shone glossy in the afternoon. The
Parramatta River added its silver gleam
beyond the shimmer of green lawn and
multi-colored flowers. The paths leading to
the house were smooth as a billiard-table
with their green felt covering, and asparagus
fern, stretched in greeny ropes, outlined the
way to the white house where the reception
was held. The white marble verandah was
strewn with rich rugs, garlanded with oak-
leaves and greeny shoots, and hung with a
green wedding-bell. The drawing-room was
massed with pink roses, the library mixed
golden roses and delphinium, while hydran-
geas were banked in coolness in the hall.
The bride wore gleaming white satins and
a Limerick-lace veil, and she was followed
by two dryad-green ’maids. The usual arch
of swords added another touch of pageantry
to the procession. Dame Eadith, in sappliirc-
blue" silks, and Mrs. Paterson, in blue-
flowered georgettes, received the guests, many
of them in full naval i*ig.
Queen Victoria Barracks re-lived some of
its splendors when the cadets of the Royal
Military College did a little parade turn in
prelude to their graduation ceremony. The
spirited march-past was watched by innumer-
able sisters, mothers and aunts, all in their
summer finery, and the young men-at-arms
deserved better of the sky than the smart
shower with which it spattered them. Per-
haps it was by W’ay of a christening, as
this is the first graduation ceremony in the
old barracks, Duntroon having, from 1910 fill
the present year, been the military train-
ing college. The changing of the guard
within the arched barrack-gates caused Pad-
dington to pause in its comings and goings
and stare with eyes eager for pageantry.
The G.-G. took the salute, and his lady was
there for the march past, hut not at the
tea-drinking in the college mess, presided
over by Brig.-General and Mrs. Heritage.
By night, too, the mess was the scene of a
junketing.
If you were a flower-lover, you went to
see- the hydrangeas and gladioli at the
Y.W.C.A. last week. The hydrangea has
never been more prodigal of its beauty than
this summer, when in great masses wide-
awake softness it gleams blue and pink and
amethystine in every garden, and spills its
splendor right down to the rocky edge of
Kirribilli Point. The Horticultural Society
fathered the show (or should it be mothered,
seeing the shrine was the Y.W.C.A.?), and
the rich loot from The Highlands, the A. J.
Hordern home at Wahroonga (there were
over 100 vivid varieties), caused the flattite,
sighing madly for a garden, to go forth
immediately and order a window-box—
small .size. The gladiolus, surely the Jacob’s
ladder of the patriarch’s dream, was there
looking as though grown in Elysian fields
by Celestial gardeners. The Misses Doug-
las (Fairfield) plucked two of the prizes
in this section. Nor must the roses miss a
mention; the thrip almost gone at last,
their velvet petals called for the eye and
the hand of a Heysen to perpetuate their
loveliness.

As pretty a sailors bride as ever stepped
under an arch of steel was Rosemary
Buchanan, who wedded Lieut. M. .T.
Clark, of the Canberra. The knot was made
in St. Mark’s by Padre Terence Naughton.
and the bride’s satin and Limerick lace were
followed by two ’maids in pink organdie
frocks and wearing wreaths of real roses.
Mr. and Mrs. John Buchanan (Rosemary
is their only daughter) entertained the
guests at No. 11 Onslow Gardens, which
was a forest of hydrangea and November
lilies, interspersed with bright girls and
young men of the Navy. The ’groom is
the son of Dr. W. G. Clark, of Tasmania.
Rice was another thing our fathers were
told they could not grow. Rice was some-
thing black men raised in primeval swamps.
If you hadn't a swamp you couldn’t have a
crop, and if you weren’t at least nigger-
brown the crop would be no good. We grew
so much this year that, after providing for
all the nation’s rice puddings, we put 880
tons aboard the Niagara for Canada. Which
proves, among other things, that our cousins
still keep up the custom, highly approved at
Yanco, of pelting their brides with the fruit-
ful grain.
A letter from a Sydney girl who lias been
visiting the show of contemporary needle-
work in Bruton-street, London, insists that

mistakably, and she is warm in praise of
white linen cushions embroidered in black
cotton. She mentions exhibits from Lord
Beauchamp; but whether the work of his
fair hands or merely lent by him does not
transpire.
The committee organising the New Year’s
Eve dance at David Jones’s in aid of the
deaf and dumb arid blind kiddies has decided
to call it the “Black Opal Ball,” been ns*-
Percy Marks has given a handsome black opal
brooch which all who attend will have a
chance of winning. Dancing will be the
main feature of the evening, with cabaret
interludes. One will be a demonstration of
the latest dance craze, the “Mexicades."
And have you heard this definition:
“Depression is doing without what our
fathers and mothers never had”?

one time on the Brisbane “Daily Mail” and had
many friends in Queensland.
Christmas trees have already blossomed in toys
and tinsels for the kindergartens. St. Paul's Hall.

tained. The Rotary Club gave the toys. Sirs. A.
E. Moore was present at both centres.

Moonee Valley course had a gay appear-
ance on Saturday, when the sun shone and
bright summery attire was in order. Flowered
chiffons and figured silks were largely favored
and there was a return to popularity of the
white frock. Mrs. Ben Chaffey’s white
georgette draperies were topped by a large
black straw hat wreathed with white roses.
Parasols made a glad showing. Mrs. James
I’urves’s scarlet one was a vivid contrast
with her blue gown. Red straw hats were
worn by many. Among those who leaned
lowards diaphanous raiment of patterned
design was Mrs. Clive Leonard, who was
accompanied by her husband. Her frock
was chiffon traced all over in ruby red, and
her matching straw hat was banded with
velvet. Mrs. A. K. Kimpton was another
who put her faith in the floral-figured frock,
her choice being golden-brown and white,
and her straw hat boasted a drooping plume
of nutmeg tint. Mrs. Jervis Crespin’s black,
white and primrose ninon dress was allied to
a small black hat. Mrs. J. J. Johnson, who
was in black embroidered georgette with a
velvet hat, was there receiving greetings from
old friends after her sojourn in England.
Mrs. J. Merrillees blended tones of mauve;
and green in her chiffon raiment. Mrs.
Rogers Thomson sported black with a touch
of red, and her daughter Kathleen wore
fine white linen. Navy blue and white in
frock and millinery was the choice of Mrs.
Albion Walkley. Mrs. A. V. Iliskens, in silk
patterned in a tiny cheek of black and white,
was with Mrs. W. S. Cox and Miss Cox,
Mrs. Alec Hunter, Mrs. Merson Cooper,
Mrs. Murray Heffernan and Miss Nellie
.Moore were others in the members’ reserve.
St. Catherine’s School Old Girls’ Associa-
tion staged a hop at the Rex for the benefit
of the school library. The president, Shirlie
Ross, in floral taffetas, and Pat Peterson, in
powder-blue chiffon, were the chief engineers
of the jollo. which gathered in about 800
dancers. The headmistress, Ruth Langley,
went along in black lace with a coat of blue
velvet, and received a posy. Miss Winter,
also in black lace, accompanied her. The
just J retired president, Kathleen Lascelles,
blended tints of blue and pink in her ninon
frock. Mrs. Norman Falkiner’s daughter
Elizabeth sported lacquer-red chiffon, and
Betty Blogg’s orange georgette gown followed
pyjama lines in its divided-skirt effect.
Cynthia Brookes was in soft draperies of
black chiffon and lace.
There was a coming-out party for Marie,
daughter of the. Roy Whites, at Dalmeny,
Toorak, on Friday night. Reception-rooms
and a marquee were decorated with Christmas
lilies, pink carnations and delphiniums. The
deb. wore vellum-toned satin. Her mother,
who was hostess, chose black velvet.
The out-patients’ department of Mel-
bourne Hospital was decked with greenery
and balloons for a Christmas party given
by the management committee and the staff.
There was a concert organised by Dr. Kaye
Scott as a curtain-raiser to dancing, many
convalescing patients attending. Matron
Bell was the hostess.
There was a dance on the Orford, attended
by about 500 people, to aid the Tweddle
Hospital. Mrs. W. Angliss, who danced in
begonia-tinted chiffon; Mrs. J. W. Spring-
thorpe, who had a silvery lame coat over
her golden-brown gown; and Stuart Davis
were the organisers, aided by a committee.
In the throng were Mrs. J. T. Tweddle,
Matron Moreland, Mrs. H. S. K. Ward, Mrs.
Harold Ward and tin* Evans Pearses.
Mrs. Ernest O’Sullivan poured tea at the
Lyceum Club for the Time and Talents
group, a bunch of women who work for
charitable causes. A discussion on next
year’s activities was led by the president,
Mrs. Rutter Clarke. Mrs. T. A. Beckett
joined the party late in the afternoon and
spoke of the progress of the free kinder-
gartens.
One day last week the bells of St. Paul’s
Cathedral pealed forth joyfully to announce
the completion of the edifice after over 50
years of work. The foundation stone was
laid by the then Governor of the State,
Lord Normanby, in 1889, but up till quite
recent times the twin spires and central
tower of the original plan have been lack-
ing. It was the placing of the pinnacle
stone and the bronze finial on the Moor-
house tower that, enabled the building com-
mittee to say, “Our job is done.” The
spires were finished in 1928, and then work
was commenced on the tower which serves
as memorial to the late Archbishop Moor-
house, founder of the cathedral. Some
thousands of people gathered about Swans-
ton and Flinders streets at the luncheon
hour to see Archbishop Head hoisted 300 ft.
heavenward by a crane to bless and dedicate
the last stone as it was placed in position.
The Archbishop having safely descended,
there was a procession into the cathedral
headed by some of the workmen, with the
Lud Mayor and clergy in full regalia bring-
ing up the rear. George Langford, the con-
tractor, presented Archbishop Head with a
mallet made of wood from the scaffolding.
Mrs. H. B. Nathan, whose lately-com-
pleted dwelling is on the old Trawalla
Estate, on Toorak-road, boiled the billy and
.set out bridge-tables as a housewarming.
Rose-red chiffon and a flower-trimmed hat
were sported by the hostess, whose sisters,
Mrs. A. B. Paterson and Mrs. J. B. Kelly,
were among the guests.
Wearing a navy-blue chiffon coat over a
frock of flowered silk in dark blue and red
with matching millinery, Mrs. 11. J. Robert-
son poured tea at the Royal Automobile
Club. Chat and music filled the afternoon.
The Austin Hospital for chronic diseases
finds the Girl Guide movement a help to its
younger feminine patients and there are a
brownie pack, a guide company and a
ranger. A further development of rangers
by the captain of the district, Miss A.
Embling, was celebrated by a sort of birth-
day party, for which there was a cake with
four candles. Mrs. Springthorpe, district
commissioner for Oakleigli, and some local
guides were there.
Ex-Mayoress Luxton took tea with the
womenfolk of aldermen and councillors on
Friday, and received as a memento of her
civic reign a gold cigarette case. Lud Mayor
Smith handed over the present, and Mrs.
Luxton returned thanks. White and mauve
irises and salmon-pink gladioli brightened
the room. Black chiffon with large white
spots was worn by Mrs. Luxton. whose mil-
linery was black straw swathed with white.
In the throng were the Morell lady, in
bottle-green. Mrs. Felix Lloyd, Mrs. F.
Stapley, Mrs. H. G. Elliott, Mrs. J. W.
Ferguson and Molly Elliott.
To help the Santa Casa holiday home at
Queenscliff there were bridge and music at

home of Mr. and Mrs. G. J. Coles, at Toorak,
to aid the Children’s Home conducted by

players. The rooms were prettily decked
with garden stuff by Mrs. A. Law.

the club running a whole squadron of
’planes for this purpose.

As a means of supplementing the State
dole to unemployed girls, two shops stocked
with Christmas gifts and so forth have been
opened in the city. All the wares have been
made by girls who have lost their jobs, and
a number of them have been told off to
attend to customers. The Benevolent
Society, of which Muriel Heagney is hon.
sec., is sponsor for the venture.
At the end-of-the-year summing-up of the
Free Kindergarten Union, the president,
Mrs. T. A. Beckett, announced a deficit of
£2482. Various plans for raising money
were discussed, and a show of antiques was
tentatively agreed upon.
Mrs. James Alston, the president, launched
a two-day bazaar at the Women’s Hospital
to provide Christmas cheer for the patients.
The takings were substantial.
The Winifred May Lees Memorial Bur-
sary at the Uni. has been awarded for the
second time in succession to Rona May
Panting, a medical student and daughter
of Dr. Panting, of Launceston. Miss Panting
is training for a career as a missionary.
The substantial sum of £lO5O goes into
the Children’s Hospital’s coffers as the
result of the ball on the Strathnaver. Mrs.
Lauchlan Mackinnon, president of the hospi-
tal, in announcing the total, disclosed that
the committee’s expenses amounted to only
£l6. The P. and O. co. paid for everything
else.
Isobel Hodge, an Adelaide girl, has joined
the Children’s Hospital staff as almoner. Her
duty will be to supervise the after-care of

interest of which will provide an exhibi-
tion scholarship to be awarded to a student
of the school.
The Orford carried away Eugene Gorman,

and son go to France, where they will stay
with relatives for a while. Mr. Gorman
leaves the liner at Colombo.
Prof. Wadham’s wife is a passenger to
England in the Orford with their young
son. She said good-bye to several of her
friends at a dinner she hostessed at the
Lyceum Club.
The announcement that smokers have been
set aside for women in British railways
recalls the advanced female who was
observed with a cigarette in her mouth in
a Victorian train in the days when the
woman smoker was practically unknown.
The guard’s respect for the regulations was
as severely shocked at this appalling spec-
tacle as his moral sense, for the compart-
ment happened to be an ordinary one. “You
can’t smoke in here,” he said. “I’m not smok-
ing,” replied the lady, shifting the fag to the
opposite corner of her not unpretty mouth.
“Well, you’ve got a cigarette in your mouth,”
said the official sharply. “I’ve got boots on
my feet, but I’m not walking,” she replied.
The death of Natalie Dawson removes a
familiar figure from this city's musical circle.
She, toured with Melba as accompanist, and
appeared with the, diva at a command per-
formance before the King and Queen. Miss
Dawson was a niece of the late J. li. Abbott,
of Bendigo, and received her early musical
education from Signor Zelman, senior, of
Melbourne, studying later with Max Yog-
rich in England. She was accompanist at the
Guildhall School of Music for some years.

Salon, she was a regular attendant at the
fortnightly social gatherings.

Maurice Macgillicuddy, her elder daugh-
ter Mauricette and Ivy Ball were among the
first-viewers. Tasmania, where Miss Dent
spent a recent holiday, is largely represented
in her landscapes and she shows portraits of
Mrs. R. Vanderkelen and Bishop Hay.
Adelaide’s affairs: —
His Ex. and Lady Hore-Ruthven are kept busy
attending the numerous fetes and charitable func-
tions that are crowding in before Christmas.
Although the viee-regals are staying at Victor
Harbor, they never fail to take the very long motor
drive to the city to keep faith with the public.
At the Amateur Turf Club’s meeting at
Cheltenham J. H. Morish and his smart little
wife were the host and hostess at afternoon-tea.
she wearing a black and white confection and a
hat of white straw. The small coatee to match
the frock or chiffon is in universal favor, but
millinery is not so uniform, large and small hats
being both plentiful.
Mesdames Hugh Davis and T. S. Cheadle excelled
themselves in the beautiful floral decorations at the
Kindergarten College, Palmer-place, North Adelaide,
when Lady Hore-Ruthven presented the diplomas to
the students. She was received by Professor
McKellar Stewart and Mrs. J. P. Morice. Part
singing by the students under the direction of
Hatlier Gell and Marjorie Bonnin was a feature.
Lady Hore-Ruthven wore a blue and white crepe-
de-Chine ensemble and a blue and white hat.
Mrs. J. Trevor-Davies, of Barkston Gardens,
London, is in Adelaide on a visit to her daughter,
Mrs. I). Leslie Todd, Kensington Gardens.
The Mayoress, president of the S.A. Creche, and
the committee invited a number of friends to the
annual pound day and Christmas treat for the
little ones. The playground was gaily decorated,
and after a tea Mrs. Glover distributed the gifts
from the tree. There was music going all the
afternoon.
The Adelaide University anticipate a huge success
with their cabaret, 600 tickets having been sold.
Westralia’s doings :—■
Old Nick sent along some of his prime furnace
weather for the Ascot meeting. Intrepid souls who
ventured forth stewed in their chiffons and men in
complete suits should have died where they stood.
The Newton Moore lady had a pert hat for her
black and pink flowered garment, while daughter
Mollie hung sweeping feathers to her millinery,
worn with a bottle-green costume. Feathers preened
in Mrs. John Forrest’s navy lid; blue and green
stripes made the diagonal cheque of Elizabeth
Edwards’s frock; a medley of red and white was
Ariel McGhee’s choice; Peggy Tomlinson was all-
white but for a shiny black band on her hat;
Lesley Everitt wore a flowered frock; Helen
Clements was in white embroidered voile and black
millinery; Mrs. John AValsh wore a sherry-red
marocain coinspotted with white; Bernie Reid’s
choice also ran to spots, her color scheme being of
amber tonings; Mrs. Rice Gemmell’s lettuce-green was
topped with black.
Something new in art exhibitions is Percy Cannot’s
show of Chinese-inspired water-colors in Temple-
Court Buildings. Mr. Cannot has a liking for
bright colors. His vivid imagination toys with
wickedly seductive ladies and cynical gentlemen
against backgrounds of gay screens and complacent
Buddhas. A mischievous satyr holding a bubble on
which is poised a nymph is a fanciful bit of allegory.
For its originality his show is worth a visit.
Mrs. Rischbieth was asked to stand for the
House of Reps, or for the Senate. After some
hard thinking she turned down the-idea, at least
for the present. It is not. often that one meets
a woman so blessed with the good things of this
world who gives 99 per cent, of her time to public
movements—but Mrs. Rischbieth does it, and the
doing does not cost her her good looks.
Brig.-General Jess, with his wife and three
children, leaves this week for Melbourne, where dad
has a new military job.
Enid Wilson, having decided that it would be
fun this year to meet old Santa at the Kindergarten
Christmas trees in her home State, stepped off the
Strathnaver at Fremantle. Enid, who is now prin-
cipal of the Kindergarten Union in Wellington
(M.L.), held for many years a similar job in
Westralia. During most of her tenure here the
Union had no such training college as Meerilinga.
Headquarters were at the Pier-street Free Kinder-
garten, where all the furniture was made for the
2A- to 6-year olds. Even Dr.' Dale, who delivered
hygiene lectures to the students, managed to curl
his long legs under the 2ft. high table.
Tassie’s titbits :—•
Some 70 delegates mustered in Launceston for the
A.W.N.L. Conference. Mrs. Mary Parker, 0.8. E.,
State president, was in the chair, and some solid
work was done. Mrs. James Smith, northern presi-
dent, and a committee made themselves responsible
for the various entertainments.
The C. of E. Grammar School, Launceston, spread
itself at the annual fete in the school grounds. The
attractions included folk dancing by Olive Justin’s
classes, tennis matches and various sideshows; there
were stalls of fancy goods and produce, and the
Mowbray band made music.
Betty, one of the attractive twin daughters of the
Iv. L. Slioobridges, of Coniston, Glenora, and John
Leake Hudspeth, of Alt, Leslie, Launceston, announce
their engagement.
ILugley added to its annual rose show an exhibition
of antiques. There were over 200 exhibits, some of
them hundreds of years old and many with
interesting bits of history attached to them. Tim
roses were very lovely.
At the prose and poetry reciting by Alary Shar-
land's pupils at the Afasonic Hall, choral speaking
was a successful innovation. As a counterblast to
the prevailing “talkie’’ accent so often heard in out
youngsters’ voices, such work has its uses.
Beattie Jordan gave her annual exhibition of
pupils’ dancing at the City Hall, and the long pro-
gramme was full of variety and charm. Group
dances, scarf dances and solos were given, the
pupils ranging from tiny five-year-olds to young
grown-ups. Airs. Kitchin played the accompaniment.
The T.A.J.C. might have had better weather for the
Guineas meeting, but there was a. good attendance.
Chairman Dr. Lindsay Miller tea-ed a big crowd in
the pavilion, and everyone was glad to see Mrs.
Miller hostessing again, in a smart dark blue
wool crepe suit, with little belted coat and “new”
sailor of blue duvet.vn. Among the crowd were the
Tom Lyonses, the Alan Walkers, the Russell Ibbotts,
Mrs. Tom Murdoch, Mrs. C. S. Agnew, the James
Murrays, Mrs. L. Oldmeadow, Airs. Mitchell (Afalaya),
the Cox Taylors, Capt. and Airs. Stoylos, Commander
and Airs. Symonds, Mrs. Peacock and daughter Alar-
garet, Airs. Howard Buchanan, the Norman Fergusons,

If any illustration in “THE BULLETIN

alleged purpose of its subject. It was fol-
lowed bv Shagreen’s ne plus ultra of con
Sred indecency. Blood-red letters sprang
“ STthe aim background o« a
prison scene:
At the very moment you are marvelling at the
lifelike presentation of McGuire, the man himself
will be in the act .of being launched to hm doom.
You will be seeing the most unique pictuie in h
world something that will never be seen again—
McGuire as he is, going to meet his Maker from the
dectrlc chair in the St. Quentin State Penitentiary,
U.S.A.
And then:
Southland Theatres present
“THE SOUL OF SCAR McGUIRE.
The music had ceased. A shocked silence
held the theatre, broken only in the 1 rotes-
sor’s ear, by Dr. Slater’s whispered: My
conscience, Ja nes ’ that’s pretty raw! I
don’t quite like that”
The Professor made a queer noise in his
throat. He was staring with a kind of fasci-
nation at the huge, ape-like figure that hacl
shambled into view. The illusion was pei-
fect. It was incredible that this was mere
photography; he sensed that all over the
house people were rubbing, their eyes ana
staring. A woman at his back titteied
nervously.
The gross bulk of the convicted murderer
—the face, with its flattened nose and pig-
gish eyes, its baggy mouth and over-shot
jaw—stood out with startling clearness.. It
was, in so far as the ordinary senses might
judge, the man himself. The Professor
could not rid himself of the notion that the
foreshortened shadow of McGuire was not
a part of the photography. But how per-
fectly absurd! Unless, of course, it was
a trick of lighting carried out from the pro-
jection box. But certainly the warden stand-
ing in the background had no shadow.
Dr. Slater was muttering : “I say, Janes,
don't they sweep this place?” .
The Professor’s own nose was wrinkling
in disgust. Taddish could say what he liked
about ventilation, but the air in the theatre
was noticeably foul. Strange, though, that
neither of them had complained, until
that moment. All this packed humanity. ...
But this simple explanation didn’t satisfy
Mm. . .
He gave his attention to the picture. Scar
McGuire had begun to speak. His voice
to quote one account, published next morn-
ing, below screaming headlines —‘‘was thick,
viscid with vice; the foetid voice of the
jungle.” It issued slowly from the bag ot
his mouth with an unctuous precision.
“Wall, folks, I guess you know wliad I’m
waiting for? I guess the warden right
alongside here would tell you they’re takin’
poor old Sear ’nd bumpin’ him orf outen the
chair, ’nd nobody think nothin’ of it. Maybe
I shouldn’t ha’ killed them people like I
done. But I ain’t had no home nor eder-
eation, not like you folks a-sittin’ comfort-
able listenin’, or maybe I wouldn’t ha’ done
it. I’m not squealing nor nothin’. Don’t
you think it. I found salvation and I ain’t
scared to die. But I wanna say this.
none of you folks do what I done. Killin s
murder, and you can’t do it. I wanna say
this. Don’t you do nothin’ you couldn’t lay
down at the Throne of Grace. Look at
me”
Blasphemous muck! What was the matter
with people? What was the matter with
Mm —-that nobody stood up and shouted
down the rank indecency of it! Faugh.
How the place reeked !
“ Why I say it don’t pay to go crooked.
When you wanna go wrong you jess listen
to th ? soul of Scar McGuire telling yous
different. What I wanna say is this”....
The Professor, staring, was aware of
something unusual taking place. This,
surely, hadn’t happened at the pre-view.
Or, perhaps, it was his memory that was at
fault. Certain it was that McGuire was
coming closer to the edge of the screen plat-
form ! No, that couldn’t be it. Then what
was it? And what was it McGuire was
saying? This was not according to what he
had heard before. In God’s name, what was
he saying? Incredible ! This was madness
—this voice from the pit shouting down that
other voice on the sound strip !
“What I wanna say is this. What I’ve
told you is bunk. Fergit it. To Hell with
the lot of you! Bump Scar McGuire oft,
would they! Burn the body out of him !
They’re saying he’s dead, are they—are they?
Dead! Do I look dead? That was some-
thing they didn’t know, qlever as they think
themselves. Scar McGuire dead! Not on
your life. He’s alive! He’s here /”
Now at last Professor Janes knew what
was happening. The mouthing, blaspheming
figure was stepping out of the picture into
the darkened auditorium. Something had
gone wrong with the strip mechanism, for
the voice had ceased.
Only a little whispering like a gust of
wind ruffled the surface of the gloom. The
Professor knew it for a rising tide of primi-
tive human terror. People were on their feet
all over the house, trying to see what was
happening, making for the exits.
And all the while the film was going on :
a ridiculous background of prison wall, with
the warden standing stiffly watchful over —
nothing. McGuire was not there. He wasn’t
anywhere to be seen. There was nothing
of him left.
The Professor’s heart seemed suddenly to
stand still. Immediately below him, as he
clung to the rail of the circle, massed
shadows broke, vomiting sound indescribable.
Such screams he would remember to liis
dying day—such screams. And from the pit
of them, as the picture abruptly went- black,
it seemed to Janes there rose the dreadful
tones of Scar McGuire.
“Dead, am I! Well, say, youi neck
squeezes real soft, lady!”
Slater and a score of others were appeal-
ing for light. In response there showed —a
pinpoint on a sea of usher’s
torch, from somewhere near the foot of the
screen. In one of those odd pauses, which
seem to mark the gathering together of
human panic to fresh effort, Shagreen was
heard hoarsely beseeching:
“For God’s sake, keep your seats! Every-
thing’s all right. Keep your seats. It’s only
a breakdown. Give us just a minute!”
All at once the lights came on. So sudden
the relief, so blessed the transition from the
unseen to the seen, that the babel fell to
a whisper. The stampede for the exits
ceased. People stood and looked about
them, and were reassured and immeasurably
comforted by the absence of anything fright-
ening. They began to ask who had started
the cry that McGuire —that awful figure—
had climbed down in among the audience.
What rot! Some woman's hysteria !
But presently they began moving again
to leave the house. It was. all very well to
talk of a breakdown ; a note of terror still
possessed them.
A cry had gone up for a doctor, and the
Professor and Slater pushed their way down
the stairs and into the stalls. Shagreen,
with blotchy, white face, shared a centre of
attention with a half-fainting woman, whose
hands were, clasped protectively around her
white throat. Someone, or something, accord-
ing to her stammered story, had attempted
to strangle her. Some huge bulk . had
appeared at her side and someone had
spoken ; but she couldn’t remember what had
been spoken. There were hands about her
neck, and it had seemed that she was on
the verge of death, when the lights vanished
from the screen, and suddenly she felt her-
self released.
An extraordinary story!
Shagreen was noncommittal. He made
no attempt to explain the bruises on the
woman’s throat. He looked and acted like a
sick man. When the little group had gone,
breathing threats, he made for his office.
The Professor and Slater followed him in.
For once his bluster was shaken. He poured
himself a stiff whisky.
“This will ruin Southlands unless that
silly rumor is stopped. All damned hum-
bug. That woman was an epileptic—you
could see that. They do that sort of thing
in epilepsy—knock themselves about.”
Slater said curtly: “No more epileptic
than you are, Mr. Shagreen.”
“All that happened was a breakdown,”
Shagreen bellowed.
“Don’t lie,” the Professor said. He
mopped a moist forehead. “The soul of
McGuire, fleeing from execution, found a
new shape to clothe itself —that life-like
screen body. He.... 1t... .whatever the
Thing was.... It’s idle to speculate.”
Shagreen’s bluff collapsed suddenly. He
threw a terrified glance about the room.
“You don’t think he’s here now, Janes?
We couldn’t see him, you know —a thing like
that! How was I to know?”
“Pull yourself together,” the Professor
ordered through set teeth. “Shagreen, de-
stroy that film. You hear me? Burn it.
Tear it up. Anything you like.”
Shagreen reached a trembling hand to-
wards the house telephone.
Wings of Song.
Give me my wings, and let me beat for
ever
Intoxicate about some high white star.
Give me my wings, the bruised soul strains
to sever
The trailing chain of earthy things that
are!
Give me my wings! I know a heavenly
pasture,
Mercy its blooms, its green grass charity;
Its air I’d drink while long kind hours
endure,
So might I soar from hates and envies
free!
Give me my wings! O Soul, what is’t to
thee,
The turmoil of the market place, the
streets
All clogged with sin? Way to a Calvary
Where a tall Cross the grey horizon meets!
O Soul, fly upward! There’s a purer air,
Where gold and dross are separate, and
angels’ chants—•
Swift shafts of dizzying motes —dance free
and fair.
And the hill-vintage naught but God
decants.
Give me my wings! Let others have their
treasure,
Their secret orchards, and their velvet
sin,
Their business treadmill, or their wmary
pleasure.
Give me my wings!
N.S.W.
NORA MCAULIFFE.
Dread.
I would not go back again to the Black
Places
Which my bruised feet once, somehow,
stumbled through,
For any gift the world has left to offer,
Even' for old dreams of happiness come
true.
I could not! Shuddering from the very
memory,
I seek forgetfulness in little things,
And drink in deep the benison of sunshine
Each hopeful morn that mounts on Sky-
larks’ wings.
And yet, God knows! to reach one fellow-
wanderer t
I would re-tread those flints from end to
end, !
Would light again those vast and icy terrors
Shoulder to shoulder with a blinded friend,
Saying: “Strike out, step out, however
feebly,
From clammy darkness into light and
strength!”
Would you not think that love and pain and
pity
With bleeding effort might build a bridge
at length?
But I can stretch no hand to grasp
another’s,
As no hand ever came to grasp my own ;
For the grim law that fashions the Black
Places
Is that each soul stands there, or falls,
alone.

The Brisbane “Telegraph** is . re-

freedom from vulgarity and stupid

The Brisbane “Telegraph** carries

SHADOW SHOWS.
Barbara Stanwyck is “Night Nurse” a.t Syd-
ney Capitol. Hospitals would be brighter,
death-beds easier, if there were more like her.
She strips to her step-ins so often that the
writer eventually lost count, and the right
swing with which she outs her employer has
the profesional technique of the snappy
uppercut with which Clark Gable, the em-
ployer’s scheming and sinister chauffeur, outs
her. Nurses with her incomparable soul,
unimpeachable legs and s.a. are all too rare;
yet it must be said that there is no justi-
fication for her frequent disrobings. It is all
as irrelevant as if Hamlet kept taking his
tights off between soliloquies. Barbara is first
encountered while training at one of those,
hospitals which are more dramatic than
many a battlefield but which no one thought
of dramatising till Hollywood showed the
way. There she binds up the bullet wounds
of Ben Lyons, a chivalrous young boot-
legger, and figures in an operating-theatre
scene which is eerier than the climax of the
average thriller. And so to the home of a
dipsomaniacal millionaire, whose wife (also
a dipso.) is starving her children to death
in order to get their money, divorce or
murder her husband, and marry the chauf-
feur. The fun—and good, clean stuff it is—
arises from the night nurse’s fight to saye
the youngsters’ lives. There are some big
moments —when the bootlegger smashes the
windows of a milkshop with his revolver,
and pinches 18 gallons of the vital fluid be-
cause the dying child needs a milk bath;
when Charles Wenninger, the nurse’s doctor-
friend, arrives to give her charge a blood-
transfusion, and is knocked out by Gable;
when smiling Ben Lyons turns up unex-
pectedly and, amid the cheers of the audi-
ence, shepherds the scowling Gable out of
the room at revolver-point. The action has
the speed of a police car; the wise-cracks
rattle like machine-guns, and the acting,
sound and photography are excellent.
“The White Lie,” which precedes “Night
Nurse,” was known as drawing-room comedy
before the stage fell into a financial decline.
Most of the scenes are laid in one of those
immense over-furnished American houses
which make members of Australia’s six-room
villa class ask one another how the blazes they
are kept in perfect order by a comic cook-
general who spends nearly all her time flirt-
ing. The joke is that Joan Bennett, the
girl-wife of Lew Ayres, has said she is
going to have a baby when she isn’t. It
leads to various complications, including the
spending of a lot of money on toys by
relations. There is a subsidiary joke—the
love of Slim Summerville for the cook-general.
Jealousy causes him to rush out and fight
one rival after another, and he comes back
looking more dilapidated after each bout. He
makes the business more amusing than it
may sound, being an accomplished panto-
mimist. “The White Lie,” while no side-
splitter, is a lot more entertaining than most
of the lies to be heard at the political meet-
ings which are competing with the talkies
this week.

“The King of Kings,” made for Pathe
a few years ago by Cecil de Mille, has
been equipped with music and sound by
R.K.0., and heads the bill at Sydney
St. James. One of the silent version’s most
dramatic scenes, Peter’s denial of his Master,
has been deleted, presumably to make room
for choral effects, but these, though allegedly
the product of 1000 voices, are not impres-
sive. . However, the acting is capable, and
the successive tableaux are arranged with
artistry. H. B. Warner’s Nazarenc is the
“Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.”
He, Ernest Torrence (Peter), Jacqueline
Logan (Mary Magdalene) and Rudolph
Schildkraut (Caiaphas) stand out from a
huge cast. Particularly clever characterisa-
tions of minor roles are given by William
Boyd (Simon of Cyrene) and Victor Var-
coni (Pilate).
In “The Miracle Woman” (Sydney Hay-
market) the central figure is a girl engaged
in “selling religion” under the management
of a go-getter. She preaches from a cage
full of lions, with a jazz band in the omng,
and does faked faith-healing stunts. Hue
of her radio sermons is- the means of avert-
ing the suicide of a blind aviator; the pair
meet and fall in love. The manager wants
the lady to bolt with him to Europe, threat-
ening to expose her if she refuses. She
consents to go but tells her blind lover all
about it. He quixotically tries to make
her believe that she has cured him; then
there is a fire in the jazz-cwm-circus taber-
nacle from which he saves her. In the
end she joins the Salvation Army, and a
broad hint is given that the blind shall see.
Despite the crudity of the plot the picture
gives a convincing impression of commer-
cialised evangelism. Barbara Stanwyck as
the evangelist, David Manners as the sight-
less hero and Sam Hardy as the manager
are well cast.
* * *
“Heartbreak” (Sydney Regent) is a war
picture produced by Fox. An attache at the
U.S.A. Embassy in Vienna (Charles Far
roll) falls in love with Countess Vilma
(Madge Evans). Later he joins the Ameri-
can Air Force, brings down an enemy
’plane and discovers that the victim is
Vilma’s twin brother. Leaving the . war to
look after itself for a bit, he flies to Vienna
to see Vilma and explain that he thought he
was fighting a rival for her affections. The
excuse is rejected, the lady stating hysteri-
cally that she wishes never to see her
brother’s murderer again. So Charles flies
back, to be court-martialled for desertion. He
is imprisoned, and, on his release, rushes
off to Vilma. They fall into each other’s
arms. Nice photography ; indifferent acting.
A quaint sidelight on the. way an American
talkie-producer thinks wars are won.
“Cauboy”: Competent _ judges have re-
marked of some visiting virtuosi that if they
were deprived of such accessories as their
platform appearance, their yachts and the
romantic stories of how they escaped from
the Bolsheviks by burrowing under the Rus-
sian frontier, they Avould be found to be no
better musicians than local performers on>’
could name. When an actor or actress falls
ill, a local understudy often steps into
the vacant place; unfortunately, this is not
the case where visiting pianists, etc., are
concerned. Still, a local man once “ghosted”
for a world-famous violinist in Mel-
bourne. It was when one of ' the _ lead-
ing theatres went talkie at the beginning
of the vocal-picture boom. One of the
shorts depicted Misclia Elman playing some
items of the near-classical sort. In those
days the sound was provided by gramophone
records, more or less imperfectly synchron-
ised to the photo, of the player scraping
on the screen. One of the records was acci-
dentally dropped and irretrievably smashed.
With some misgivings the management got
Stanislaw de Tarczynski to play the piece
off-stage, and nobody noticed any change.
Tarczynski is well known to Melbourne
music-lovers by his magnificent mane of
yellow hair and his beautiful playing as first
violin in several symphony orchestras. What
they don’t know is that, he had his feet well
on the ladder of fame in Brussels before he
came to Australia. It may be that all he
lacked was the art of playing down to
popular taste.

“Gate”: The English Rugby League foot-
ballers sail for this side on April 4, after
three trial matches have been played to
select the team, and are due in Sydney on
May 25. It is considered a certainty that
Sullivan, the full-back, so well known in
Australia, will be captain, while Bryn Evans
and Ellaby, both stars here with the last
team, are also picked on this season’s form.
After the Australian programme is finished
the team goes home via Panama, playing a
programme in Maoriland.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: Reports from Germany in-
dicate that Rugby football is growing in
popularity. The game was getting a good
hold before the World War, and visits were
exchanged between German and Britisn
teams. Within the past few years these
visits have been renewed, the Barbarians,
an English side made up of old G.P.S.
players, making a tour of Germany and
France practically every season. Last year
Germany and France met in Paris in the
first Rugby international between the two
countries and got through a strenuous game
without bloodshed. It is not beyond the
bounds of possibility that Germany and
France may figure on the International
Board in days to come, if France puts her
house in order in the matter oi veiled pro-
fessionalism, as the board insists she must.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: The Victorian Football Asso-
ciation has again been toying with the idea
of amalgamating with the League. General
opinion favors two sections, with the premier
club of the V.F.A. each year displacing the
last club on the League table ; but the trouble
is that the League is not likely to allow the
Melbourne Cricket Ground to be used for “B”
section games. The question of cutting the
number of clubs from 12 to 8 is also receiv-
ing attention. The association has had a
lean time financially for some years, and
the municipalities which control the grounds
are hinting broadly that fewer clubs would
mean better gates and bigger profits for all.
It is probable that at least two clubs will
get the axe. Which they will be is not cer-
tain, but Brighton, Prahran, Camberwell and
Sandringham are all on the waiting list.
* * * *
“Spinnaker”: Bearing in mind no doubt
the experience of the solitary Queensland
representative in the Australian 18-footer
championship in Sydney last year, when she
had to try to battle her way through the
entire N.S.W. fleet, the Ma State, which
regained the championship on that occasion,
will send at least two boats to Brisbane to
take part in the races for the title early in
January. Arawatta and Australia are the
chosen pair, and others would probably have
gone up but for the heavy expense. The
finances of the two bodies who control 18ft.
sailing in Sydney are low, and little help
can be expected from that quarter.
* tK * *
“Carnoustie”: One of the most interest-
ing books about golf writer has seen of late
is a new addition to the Lonsdale Library,
a series familiar to most followers of field
games. In pointing out that golf, though
long played in Scotland and even in parts
of England, suddenly took on a tremendous
impetus in the closing years of the last cen-
tury, an impetus which has not yet been
lost, the author puts his finger directly on
the reason for a sudden vogue which has
puzzled many an admirer of the game. His
idea is that the invention of the gutta-percha
ball, which superseded the old-time missile
of leather stuffed with feathers, brought the
game within the reach of everyone. The old
pill cost four or five shillings, and often did
not last out a round. The gutty could be
got for a shilling, and was comparatively
indestructible.
* * * *
“Westward Ho”: A recent Bulletin
reference to Padgham, winner of the British
professional golf championship, reminds me
that the young man is noted for his self-
confidence, to put it mildly. He was so
sure of being picked as one of the English
team to play the -American professionals for
the Ryder Cup in Yankeeland that he
turned down a first-class job as a profes-
sional with one of the great Continental
clubs. The English selectors didn’t pick
him for the cup team, and he had to wait
for the championship to get a bit of his own,
back. He is a deadly putter, a department
in which most English players are weak, and
his skill on the greens won him the title,
most of his opponents at the closing stages
being Ryder Cup players.
* * * *
“Sandwich”: One of the few British golf
titles which Americans have failed to wrest
from Britain is the women’s championship,
though a good many have had a try at it.
Helen Hicks, who unexpectedly won the
American title from the holder, Mrs. Vare
(Glenna Collett), is to enter for next year’s
event. It will not be her first appearance in
England, for she played in the championship
two years ago without success. Mrs. Vare
also intends to make a fourth attempt. She
was beaten last season by Diana Fishwick,
and before that was unlucky enough to face
on, two occasions that wonder golferette
Joyce Wethered, the finest associate player
the game has yet seen.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Everyone knows the
tennis bounder —he is usually about the
tenth-rate class —who loves to stroll on to
a court with a dozen or so assorted racquets
under his arms or otherwise disposed about
his person. Two of these recently received
a set-back in America. They were motor-
ing to some tournament and stopped at an
obscure village to' ask the way. The local
.sheriff and Sherlock glued his eye to a pile
of some 20 racquets in the back of the car
and wanted an explanation as to how the
pair came into the possession of such a
quantity. The explanation was not satis-
factory, and they were locked up for being
in possession of goods suspected to have
been stolen. They had to put in some time
in the clink before their bona fides were
established.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: The French tennis authori-
ties who have charge of the Davis Cup
arrangements have fixed the date of the
opening round as not later than May 10,
the second and third following at nine-
day intervals and the fourth starting on
July 11. The European zone final, in which
Australia may figure if a team is sent, is
down for July 18, the inter-zone decider
beginning on July 22. The challenge round
against France, at Paris, opens on July 28.
& * * * *
“Cash Amateur”: Bill Tilden, now raging
up and down Europe with his team of pro-
fessional tennis-players, has successfully
organised a world union which will look after
the interests of the pros, and organise tour-
naments and international matches. So far
Australia’s small coterie of professionals
have not been informed on the subject.
Though players like Anderson, Baker and
O’Hara Wood are competent to take their
places in any class, there does not seem
much scope for the formation of a branch
of the union here, where practically no pro-
fessional tennis is played. Some of them
might care to figure in overseas tourneys,
but the inducement would have to be good
to justify the time and trouble necessary.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: As to clowning on
tennis courts (B. 9/12/’3l), it seems to be
the proper thing to do nowadays. The very
latest exponent of the art is Fred Perry,
the English player who learned the game on
a ping-pong table and soon forged his way
to the front rank of the world’s best tennis-
players—an eloquent commentary, by the
way, on the value of tennis considered in
terms of athletics. An English tennis rag
admiringly comments upon the new star:
“His antics on the court, his general irre-
sponsibility, his remarks —these attract
attention.” Is there any other sport on
earth which would put up with that sort of
thing? Fancy a Rugby footballer or a
Test-match cricketer trying to “attract
attention” by “antics” and “remarks”!
* * * *
“Lancaster Park”: Maoriland’s cricket
council reports a loss on the All Black tour
of England of £1461, and an art union is
to be launched to rake in the money to
wipe out the deficit. At the same time, the
shareholders in Cricket Ltd., the co. that
was formed to finance the M.L. tour abroad,
are to get their money back plus a six per
cent, dividend.
* * * *
“Aileron”: The argument as to whether
petrol can be ignited easily will not matter
much if a new fuel which has been
tested at Croydon (Eng.) aerodrome mea-
sures up to its reputation. Accounts of the
tests state that when red-hot pieces of metal
were dropped in ordinary petrol the. stuff
ignited at once, whereas when placed in the
other fuel, which is merely petrol chemically
treated, neither red-hot metal nor lighted
matches nor sparks from the magneto could
set it going. The importance of this from
an airman’s point of view need not be
stressed. If there is one thing more than
another calculated to make a flying man
shudder it is the prospect of his plane catch-
ing fire after a crash.
“Old Timer”: At the beginning of the
century yachting was Sydney’s toniest pas-
time. There was hardly a prominent family
without a member who sailed in a big way,
and the club at Ivirribilli was as hard to get
into as the Union. No Fairfaxes, Knoxes or
Dangars own yachts nowadays; Walter
Marks, T. H. Kelly and others of their type
and generation are permanently the
beach; anyone can get into the li.Y.S. who
goes to the expense of having his photograph
taken in a dinghy, and practically all the
famous yachts are in the hands of obscuri-
ties. Golf, motoring and motor-boating are
responsible. There is only one sport in
Australia that can tackle all the others put
together on any fine afternoon and lick
them hands down —racing at headquarters. I
regret to have to admit, however, that it
Mr. Whiddon were allowed to stage half a
dozen lotteries in an afternoon on an area
as big as Randwick he would soon make
racing as unfashionable as petrol has made
yachting.
* * * *
“Shikari”: The cables have been enthus-
ing over the invention of a new rifle cart-
ridge with a special streamlined bullet
which has a muzzle velocity of 4000 m.p.h.,
nearly twice the pace of the military Lee-
Enfield. The bullet has a “ghost tip,” pre-
sumably for lessening air resistance without
interfering with the bullet’s hitting capacity
—an important point. The cartridge
is loaded with a special charge of a new
powder, and much is made of the fa r -t
that the missile travels at 20Oft. per
second, in which time an objective moving
at 20 m.p.h. would have gone only three
feet, enabling the allowance for a mov-
ing target to be considerably reduced. The
trouble about the thing seems to be that
the rifles now in use would be unable to
stand up to the strain of such a cartridge
and new ones would have to be designed.
In the case of a n entire army being re-armed
with a new type of rifle that would not
matter so much. But where it affects the
makers of standard sporting rifles of all
sorts and conditions, small bore and large,
it is another story altogether.
J. S. (“Jimmy”) Anderson, who crossed
the line for the last time in Brisbane the
other day, bringing his score to 71, was one
of the greatest Rugby players who ever
stripped for the northern State. Born in
Maoriland, he came to Queensland in the
’eighties and soon built up a football repu-
tation that extended far beyond liis adopted
State. A tall, heavy man, with a wonderful
turn of foot, he was a thorn in the side of
N.S.W. and M.L. sides for years, and in his
heyday was probably the best wing three-
quarter of his time. In Brisbane, Charters
Towers and Croydon his athletic ability
combined with a most engaging personality
made him a general favorite, and when, in
later days, his business occasions took him
to all parts of Queensland, he became pro-
bably the best-known Queenslander from
Thursday Island to the Tweed.
* * * *
This week’s Test match will be the last
chance N..S.W. will have of seeing the
Springboks in action. From Sydney they
go to Geelong to play the Victorian country-
men. They are to open the third Test in
Melbourne on December 31. Then, after a
trip to Tassy, they will tackle South Aus-
tralia and Australia in Adelaide, returning
to Melbourne for the fifth and last Test be-
ginning on February 12. Melbourne, it will be
noted, has scored two Tests again this time,
as she did in the case of the West Indies, but
her triumphal trot is to be stayed when the
next English side comes over. On that occa-
sion Sydney will have two Tests.
* * * *
“Swivel”: The annual regatta of the
Nepean Rowing Club —the only country fix-
ture N.S.W. rowing can boast, by the way—
had for its star attraction the State fours
championship, over two miles. Once more
Mosman took home the bacon, the North
Shore crew, stroked by 11. W. Butler, retain-
ing the title with ease. Winners were two
lengths ahead of Haberfield, and the time
was 12min. 42isec. —quite tidy, considering
that they weren’t pushed.
* * * *
“Hoppit”: At last the unhappy pedes-
trian has received some measure of recog-
nition from a motor-obsessed community.
Manchester has installed a new method of
traffic control which is worked by the foot-
slogger when desiring to cross a street.
Lights of various colors are set up on posts
at intervals; three buttons pressed in suc-
cession show green, yellow and red lights,
the last stopping all traffic. The pedestrian
is then given 12 seconds to get across 60 feet
of street.

TRAVELLERS’ TALES.
“The biggest cockroach I ever saw was
on the Gilbert; he • woke me up fighting
with a bush rat.”
“Which licked?”
“The cockroach, easily.”
“I never saw a cockroach as big as that,
but I’ve seen some terrors of white ants
up in the Territory. By gosh! they can
build faster than a jerry-builder. We were
camped with a small mob of cattle in white-
ant country one night, and they had built a
wall four feet high round the cattle by the
morning. Devil of a job we had to get
them out of it.”
“I’ve seen spinifex grow pretty fast out
west. The worst kind grows up in rings,
and the horses, when their shins get sore,
jump over instead of walking round it. I’ve
seen a horse get regularly pounded; spini-
fex grew so fast that it was as high as his
head before he had time to jump out again.”
“Tell you what I’ve seen a snake do.”
Chorus: “Oh, dry up about snakes.”
“No, but this is a fact. We had a cook
in camp who used to bake light bread;
and one night he had set a ‘sponge’ all
ready to pop into the camp-oven at day-
light. It was up north, and one of these
pythons came prowling around the camp
and swallowed the cook’s sponge, dish and
all. We found him close to the camp in
the morning, with part of his body fit _to
burst, for the dough had risen inside him.
When we killed and opened him we took out
the finest batch of light bread you ever saw,
cooked by the heat of his body.”
And then the meeting adjourned.
[2l/4/’94]
Some time ago a man living in a bush
township went to Melbourne for a week.
He was a widower living in an isolated
house of his own, and _he just locked up
and cleared without saying a word to any-
body. Before he went he. lit his fire and
made a cup of tea, and gnawed the last
remnant of flesh from an ancient liam-
bone ; then got on his horse, whistled to his
dog and rode off. Half an hour afterwards
a log (that is the theory) rolled out of
the fireplace and burnt the house down
without anybody noticing it. Next day
somebody passed and saw smoke and smelt
fire, and reported to the police. The police
“made inquiries” and found the man hadn’t
been seen for several days. So they searched
the ashes and found the hambone, and
decided that the man had been too drunk
to crawl out of the way of the flames and
the hambone was all that was left of him.
UNSOLD.
VISITOR: “Ah! A well-stocked library, I see.”
HOST; “Yes, I wrote both those books myself.”
(“Hop.” —3/9/’92.]
They placed it on a sapling bier and covered
it decently with a uniform coat, and car-
ried it shoulder-high to the doctor, who,
after putting some dexterous questions,
identified it as the scapula of an adult
male about 274 years of age and oft. 7m.
high (the man was exactly years ot
age and sft. 7in. high). Then a coroners
jury sat on the liambone and returned a
verdict of “Suicide while of unsound mind,”
and next day the hambone was put in an
elegant coffin, covered with flowers and
followed bare-headed by several towns-
people to the cemetery, where a minister
made affecting discourse over the_ solitary
remnant of the departed, and pointed out
how the remainder of him was at that
moment soaring on muslin wings through
golden streets, where banana-peel never
falls on the pavement. Then the funeral
party proceeded slowly homewards, and at
the end of the main street met the corpse
just returned from Melbourne. As soon
as they recovered from their astonishment
they told him he was a low-liver, and a
drunken sot, and an atheist, and presented
him with a bill for £l2 11s. 6d. for his own
funeral expenses. He objected; but the
hambone was resurrected and placed in
evidence against him, and when he still
refused to pay up the police arrested him
for personating the hambone under the
156th clause of the Elections Act. and he
was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.
Local public feeling is dead against him, and
when he gets out he will have to go to
Coolgardie.— L 26/5/’94. ]
Here is a very
pathetic incident,
which has been
known to move
strong men. It tran-
spired at Goldsbor-
ough, near Dunolly
(Vic.), in ’B6. The
White H'orse Com-
pany was sinking on
the Birthday line.
One day just before
“knock-off” the brace-
man —a dreamy in-
dividual of alcoholic
habits —dropped his
spanner down the
shaft, greatly to the
detriment of Philip
O’Daley, who was in-
dustriously delvjng
below. Poor Phil
was badly damaged
about the head, and
when brought to the
surface was quite
unconscious. Whilst
the boys were carry-
ing the injured miner
across the paddock
to his little home on
the outskirts of the
township, the boss
ran on ahead to
break the news to
his wife. Now,
although Mr. and Mrs. O’Daley agreed
pretty well in general there were times
when Philip smote his spouse with
considerable force. Mr. O’D. was something
of an epicure in a humble way, and when his
victuals were not up to expectations, he im-
pressed his convictions on Mary’s mind with
much variegated profanity and a “skelp” or
two. The boss found Mrs. O’Daley bending
anxiously over a composite dish of some
kind which she was testing with a spoon.
He gravely hinted at impending difficulties
and earnestly advised the lady to be calm
and bear up. “Fwhat’s wrong?” queried
the housewife anxiously. “Is O’Daley off
dhrinking?” “Worse than that,” replied the
boss. “He has been hurt at the mine and
is being carried in here unconscious.”
“Onconscious!” exclaimed Mrs. O’D., drop-
ping the spoon and heaving a profound sigh
of relief. “Onconscious. is it? Och, then!
Misther Burns, it moight av bin worser —
th’ shtew’s shmoked !” [2l/12/’B9.]
Among the passengers on the good ship City
of Melbourne during the awful “Dande-
nong” gale, in which so many lives were lost,
was a little ninety-pound woman, half-bar-
maid, half-actress, whose cabin had been
completely swamped by the inrush of a sea
which broke right over the heavily-laboring
steamer. The steamer gave her a miscel-
laneous assortment of dry clothes to put
on, and, as her cabin was “swimming,”
perched her up on a bunk in the bar. Around
the bar was gathered a coterie of bookmakers
who, like the rest of the passengers and
crew, believed that their last day had come;
every mother’s son of those metallicians was
dead sure that he had had his last sfiff ’un,
so far as this world was concerned. The ship
wallowed in the troughs of the huge waves;
the screw raced as no engineer ever befoi-e
heard it race; the dying l-acehorsps screamed
like human beings in their agony. The cap-
tain regarded the ship’s case as hopeless, and
so it w-ould have been but for the calm cour-
age of Tait (now commander of the Bur-
rumbeet), her chief officer. But the little
woman in the steward’s bunk had lots of
sand, and soon gave evidence of her per-
severance. “Look here, steward ” she said,
“you’ve been kind to me in lending clothes
and giving lodgings, and so I must look after
your interests. And now. gentlemen,” she
continued, addressing the depressed throng
of sports, “what are you going to drink?
Nothing but champagne, mind; but you’ll
never have to pay; you can have credit till
the sea gives up its dead on the great settling
day—on the Day of Judgment. I’ll keep
account on the slate; so go ahead and drink
while you may; I’m sure you’re not a pray-
BEASTLY AWKWARD.
HOBART POLICEMAN (to Brown, who has just had a night at the
lodsh): “Now then, move on!”
BROWN: “Don’t talksh such utter bosh, man. Wish I (hie)

ing lot.” So the bookmakers mechanically
ordered champagne, and hung on by their
eyebrows and noses to drink it; and by-and-
bye the champagne got into their hard heads,
and they began to order champagne un-
mechanically. And when the danger was all
over and the ship had got to port at last,
the little woman up on the steward’s bunk
had £lOO against them for liquor, and right
glad they were to square it. [4/5/’B9.]
Old Hegarty, who leased the ancient
Sydney Queen’s Theatre for some years, was
prone to dabble in speculations which were
not always successful. A friend of his once
induced him to buy an infallible egg-preserv-
ing composition which he (the friend) had
just invented, pointing out that through eggs
lay the way to fortune, for they were only
ninepence a dozen just then, while in the
winter months their selling price was at
least half a crown. Hegarty espoused the
idea with unction, and bought up every egg
in Sussex-street without delay, and turned
the theatre for a time into a produce store,
where he and his assistants were for ever
dipping eggs into some mysterious liquid,
and then re-casing them. This might have
been going on till now were it not that the
first-purchased eggs soon began to odorise so
lustily that Hegarty suddenly suspended oper-
ations and came very near suspending his
friend the inventor. As for the eggs that
remained fresh, or partially fresh, he, with
the assistance of his company, speedily ate
them, but the bad ’uns he didn’t know what
to do with. They were fast ruining the name
of the theatre, too; when the curtain rose
o’ nights, the audience in the stalls usually
rose, too, and the stench was so powerful
that the Ghost of “Hamlet,” usually a pon-
derous and very palpable person, might
have been wafted along on it w T ith the aid
of a blacksmith's bellows at a distance of at
least three feet from the ground. Just then
an alligator came to town and Hegarty,
hearing that the favorite food of the saurian
in captivity was hen-fruit, went round and
sold a number of cases to the owner at a
loss of scent per cent, on first cost. Re-
turning after an interval of some days, in
order to trade off the remainder of his stock,
he was compelled to force an entrance
through a strong effluvium which was
ringing the till and taking money at the
door. Inside he found the alligator in con-
vulsions, while the proprietor, with tears in
his eyes, was applying mustard to the pit
of the unfortunate animal’s stomach. The
eggs had been a death blow, and its spirit
passed peacefully away one afternoon just
as the inspector of nuisances was wrangling
with the owner of its scaly tenement about
the shameful state of his premises.

A MIRAGE ON THE TRAM.
[G. R. Ashton.— 3/9/’92.]
OPTIMIST TO PESSIMIST.
Though all your plans may “gang aglee,”
Though every man may seem your foe,
Though flies may tumble in your tea
And passers-by compress your toe,
Though shares you hold in every co.
That’s busted, do not act the jay
Here’s something to relieve your woe —
“It is not always washing-day!”
Sometimes, of course, things will not gee;
Sometimes your row is hard to hoe;
Still, do not lie down wearily,
And blaspheme all things high and low.
Besides offending Bishop Goe,
Curses don’t hold the world at bay:
Just climb up op your fence and crow— *
“It is not always washing-day!”
Come, live with us in Arcady;
Sell that sad face to Holy Joe;
To gladness give your heart in fee;
You’ll find life’s tempests gentler blow.
You’re sure to reap whate’er you sow;
Who sows sad tares won’t reap ripe hay;
Throw back your head and laugh
“Heigh ho!
It is not always washing-day!”
Friend, when your cake seems turned to
dough,
Just take podophyllin, and pray
That God will teach your soul to know
It is not always washing-day!

STEELE GREY.
BARBEE.
Barber was the sourest man everybody
had ever met. He was a long, thin, lugu-
brious wretch, with hollow cheeks, hollow
MY FIRST AND LAST ATTEMPT AT SKATING.
[Phil May. — 17/8/’89. ]
eyes and a hollow chest, and an appearance
of being the victim of merciless dyspepsia.
But Barber was in excellent health, and
had never had occasion to spend a copper
on “doctors’ stuff” in all his life. Barber
was fortunate; three parts of his land was
the best in the district, it was bisected by a
creek, and the spring in his well never wholly
failed even in time of fierc-
est drought. He was a flour-
ishing settler, and things
went well with him, yet he
always affected to be more
miserable than the legendary
“orphan bandicoot on a
burnt ridge,” and wailed
eternally to his friends and
family about his awful luck.
He preached his belief that
Heaven and Gehenna were
leagued against him, and
when anything unfortunate
happened, drought, fire or
flood, it was “just my luck !”
and Barber’s utterly woebe-
gone appearance was quite
commensurate with his
dreadful fate as the butt of
angels and devils.
One day the settler was
running a furrow across
what he called his back pad-
dock. The ground was hard,
and necessitated a good
team. Presently the share
struck an immovable object,
and a minor catastrophe fol-
lowed. Barber had a fall,
and sustained superficial in-
juries to the jaw. and the
team got mixed up with the
plough, and broke things in
the excitement of the
moment.
Three hours later it was
known to everyone within a
radius of ten miles that
Barber had struck a rich
reef in his back paddock.
Inquiring friends found Barber mounting
guard over his reef and a barrow-load of
dazzling specimens.
“H'ow about your luck now, old party?”
somebody asked.
“Dunno, dunno,”
replied Barber,
miserably. “Look at
that plough o’ mine
—ruined, simply
ruined!”

The Work of Brother Petherick.
HAROLD MERCER
GOES TO A BUSH WEDDINO WITH SOME INTER-
ESTING TRIMMINGS.
OUT here in the open spaces there was
great work to be done, thought John
Petherick, with the lust in his veins
for activity which other men might have
turned to the loose pleasures of life. A
strong religious training had turned Petlie-
rick’s life into different channels; admitted
to the Brotherhood, he brought a youthful
enthusiasm to the cause, which explained
why he was out further than ever the
Brotherhood had reached before.
Probably confusing the gladness with
which the Great Outback greeted any visi-
tors, he had taken the warmness of the hos-
pitality extended, to him as a criterion of
the eagerness with which the arrival of
religion was welcomed. Coming away from
the Caseys, who, apart from emphasising
the fact that they were staunch “Calitholics,”
had hailed him with approval and reverence
—setting aside the prejudices of his train-
ing he had even “confessed” the members of
the family, seeing that they desired it—he
felt an exaltation in the work he was doing.
To go away feeling that he had been able
to stir the religious feelings of the Caseys,
members of an alien flock, was an achieve-
ment.
Getting wind of his advent, the Berrimans
had invited him to come to their homestead,
and thither he was bound now.
There was joy in the sun-languid air as
his horse paced along the track upon which
he had been set. Petherick almost dozed
in the saddle with the tranquillity of the
day. He was roused by a stir of dust on
the horizon, the cause of which he made
out to be a horse, hard-ridden, coming in
a direction which would head him off on
his path. He jogged his steed moderately
to meet the stranger.
“You’re the parson, ain’t you?” asked the
rider, when nearly a mile further on they
met. “Glad ter meet yer, parson. Me
name’s Egbert—one of old Jacob Holden’s
sons. They sent me out to meet yer, hear-
ing you were coming to the Caseys an’ goin’
on to th’ Berrimans. The old mail’d be glad
if you c’d give us a call.”
“I’ll only be too glad, Mr. Holden,” said
Petherick. “When I leave the Berri-
mans”—
“Our place is about sixty miles south-
west of the Berrimans,” said the boy.' He
was already dismounted, standing by the
parson’s saddle; and, stooping down, he
started to make a plan of directions in the
sand which seemed confusing to the Brother,
although the details burnt themselves into
liis mind.
“Y’see,” said Egbert, “’Arold an’ Mil-
dred ’as been thinkin’ of gettin’ married fer
three or four years, an’ Dad says you might
come along an’ get it over. Apart from
that, we’d all be glad ter see you—at least
that’s what Dad says.”
Petherick sensed a lack of enthusiasm in
the boy’s manner and resolved to overcome
his suspicions.
“I’ll come along, Egbert,” he said, mindful
of the value of familiarity.
“They call me Eg,” said the lad.
“Right-oh, Eg!” said Petherick heartily.
“I’ll be along and do the marrying. Harold’s
your brother, eh?”
“Yairs,” said Eg.
“And Mildred?”
“Millie? Oh, Millie was ole Parkliam s
daughter. Parkliam tried to run Bineroo,
but it broke him; an’ when he died lie
just left Millie, ’oo was only a kid of nine.
She came to live with us.”
“Ah ’ A boy-and-girl affair! She and
Harold have grown up together?” suggested
Petherick.
“Yairs, that’s about it,” said Eg, as if em-
barrassed, and he changed the subject
quickly. “You’ll prob’ly wanter stay three
days at the Berrimans. If Dad calls the
weddin’ fer Monday, will that do?’
“I’ll be there,” said the Brother, heartily.
“Now, are you coming along in my direc-
tion? If so”
“I’ll be goin’ to the Caseys ter give them
an invite,” said Eg. “You might tell the
Berrimans ter come along.”
It was in this manner that Petherick
received his invitation to the Holden home-
stead; and when he arrived there on Mon-
day he was accompanied by the Berriman
people in sulkies and on horseback. For
all that it had struck him that the Berri-
mans, who had treated him royally, had
shown some reticence in talking about the
Holdens, as if there was a coolness between
the families. ITolden, he learned, was a
man who had pushed out into the wilder-
ness and had never gone back on his tracks
further than the nearest township. His
first wife, who had shared his early battling,
had died; the woman-friend who had come
out to nurse her in her illness had remained,
and was the present Mrs. Holden.
Any coolness that prevailed notwithstand-
ing, it was something like a cavalcade that
had set off to the Holden holding, quite
satisfied that the informal invitation was a
comprehensive one.
Petherick was astonished, on his arrival,
to find the homestead surrounded by parked
vehicles. Spread out as it was, it looked
quite a considerable concourse, and Petherick
wondered where in these unpeopled wastes
the people came from. The Caseys were there,
and others he had met; so apparently the
invitations had been broadcast on a wide
range. As the Berriman party added its
numbers to the crowd, a bearded giant, his
face-whiskers slightly greyed, but vigorous
in bearing, detached himself and approached.
“’Ow do. Jake?” said Berriman. “This is
Mr. JJolden, Brother Petherick.” After
effecting the introduction he turned away
to let the pair transact their business.
“Pleased ter meet yon. Mister,” said the
bearded giant, grasping Petherick’s hand in
a tremendous and powerful paw. “We’re
all ready, ye see, an’ waitin’. The beer
arrived just before you did,” he said, jerking
his thumb over to where men were rolling
kegs from a light waggon, “so there ain’t no
reason to wait. You might want a wash-up
an’ a rest first; but ’ow long will it be,
d’you think, before you can get to this
’itching?”
“Well”—began Petherick; but a big,
youngish man, in many ways like the bearded
giant but not so matured, who had been
lurking irresolutely in the background,
stepped forward with an interruption.
“As long as it don’t ’ang over another
night,” he said. “I ain’t goin’ to ’ave it
’angin’ over another night.”
“Mind yer own blarsted business, ’Arold!”
cried Holden..
Hearing the name, Petherick turned and
extended his hand. “So this is the bride-
groom?” he said. “I’m pleased to meet
you.”
“Yes, I’m the bridegroom,” said Harold,
“an’ I reckon this is my business. Ever
since it was arranged that me an’ Mildred
sh’d get married, they reckoned it wasn’t
right that we should sleep together till the
job was done.”
“Shut up, ’Arold!” roared Holden.
“I ain’t goin’ ter shut up,” retorted
Harold, sullenly. “Mildred gits nervous
sleepin’ alone, an’ that shake-down on the
verandah ain’t no blinkin’ good ter me.”
“Mister Petherick,” said Holden, “ ’Arold
’as give the show away ; but we was goin’
ter make you wise to it, anyway. These
young people grew fond of each other, as
young people will. When we found out
what was goin’ on, ,we made up our mind
ter git them married at the first oppor-
tunity—an’ you was the first opportunity.
Now you know the position: the pair’d ’ave
been married before, legal, if there d been
a parson to marry them. Bein’ young they
didn’t w r ait fer a parson. Does it make any
difference to you?”
A good deal shocked, but quite realising
the position, Petherick murmured that in
taking the right course it was better late
than never. He assured both Holden and
Harold that he would lose no time in getting
to business, and was taken within the home-
stead. meeting and shaking hands with many
people on the way, to be introduced to Mrs.
Holden. She was a large and genial lady
who was busy on the jireparations for a big-
scale festivity; and she had to wipe floured
hands to shake the one Petherick extended.
“Mister Petherick says ’e can get movin’
straight away, missus,” said Holden; “so
directly you’ve got the tucker fixed, you'd
better get dolled up an’ give us the word. ’
“I’m so glad!” cried Mrs. Holden. “I
was so afraid there would be trouble about
the bands. We haven’t got any band ’ere,
though old Solly plays the concertina. ’
“You mean, reading the banns?” said
Petherick, with a smile. “Oh, I think that
is quite unnecessary under the circum-
stances.”
“Well, ’ow about ’oldin’ the wedding on
the verandah where the people can stand
down below an’ look on?” asked Holden.
“If we ’old it in the ’ouse there’s not more n
a dozen can get a good look in.”
“That will do admirably.” said Petherick.
“And ’ow about the water?” asked Holden.
“Will it do in a tin basin?”
“The water?”
“Yes, you know —fer sprinkling.
Petherick, with a tendency to laugh, real-
ised the mistake. “Oh, water is only re-
quired for a christening!” he said. We
won’t want it for the wedding.
“There! I told ’im, but ’e would ’ave
’is way!” said Mrs. Holden. “ ’E's forgot
just what does take place at a wedding.
“Even clergymen do that sometimes, ’
said Petherick smoothly.
An hour later he found himself, arrayed
in the surplice lie carried with his few be-
longings, standing on the weather-beaten
and sun-dried verandah facing a queer con-
course The white garment was the sole
religious touch to a picture wholly pastoral,
even down to the horses and poddy calves
that took a curious interest on the outposts
of the gathering. Harold stood stiffly un-
comfortable beside the small table provided
from the household furniture as an altar,
and decorated, with an idea that that was
appropriate, with a decanter of water and
a glass; but his father, obviously much out
of the habit of wearing a coat, from which
he bulged wherever it was possible to bulge,
looked even more uncomfortable. There
really was a considerable prettiness about
the bride, Mildred, which not even the out-
of-dateness of her simple frock could mar.
The normally comfortable Mrs. Holden was
in a “best” dress that had no doubt fitted her
once.
As Petherick prepared to open the service
the crying of a baby which had for some
time provided a monotonous annoyance burst
out more furiously. Petherick, concerned at
a tendency amongst the junior members of
the congregation to giggle at the interrup-
tion, wondered why the mother did not quiet
her offspring or remove it out of hearing.
The interlude held up the proceedings, and
Millie looked anxiously back towards the
house whence the sound came.
A moment it lulled, and Millie turned
again towards the Brother; but immediately
the yells restarted with a doubled energy.
“It’s not a bit of use,” Mrs. Holden spoke
suddenly. “Millie, I told you that you
would have to give the baby wliat it wanted
before the ceremony if you wished it to keep
quiet; and I’m sure now the reverend gentle-
man won’t mind waiting a bit whilst you
attend to it. It’s hungry, poor thing. You
wouldn’t mind, would you?”
In a dazed way Petherick heard Harold
mutter an appeal to “get the thing over and
done with” first; he knew that his face was
a flaming scarlet as he nodded his assent
to a delay, and Millie hurried away to her

maternal duties. Petherick Avas little more
than a boy; it was natural for him to be
embarrassed. In any case he had never
heard of another occasion in which a wed-
ding had been delayed in order to allow the
bride to nurse her baby.
“I—l didn’t know there was a child,” he
stammered.
“We were going to tell you, of course,”
said Holden aAvkwardly, “but Ave thought
it best to wait until ’Arold and Millie were
fixed up reg’lar.”
“I will have to christen the child.”
“We were goin’ to ask you—after—to
christen the ’ole three of ’em,” said Mrs.
Holden.
“Three! There are three?”
“The eldest is four,” said Mrs. Holden with
grandmotherly pride, “an’ all fine children,
too!”
Petherick was suddenly ashamed of being
shocked. It was not for him to judge, these
people. He could not estimate the difficul-
ties that stood in their way in getting to
the religious aid which had hitherto found
it impossible to get to them. Enough for
him that they had taken the first oppor-
tunity to level their affairs with the reli-
gious conventions.
The infant’s cries had died down, and
shortly Millie returned, and without hitch,
but with much bashfulness on the part of
the couple and some scarcely suppressed
tittering amongst the onlookers, the cere-
mony went forward. Brother Petherick sub-
sequently went right on with the business
of the christening, and found it a bigger one
than anticipated; for there were many
children present avlio had not been formally
admitted to holy church.
Some of the children,' filled with the ter-
rors of the mysterious, Avere anything but
passive resisters, and had to be caught and
pacified before they were sprinkled and gh’en
their names in a Christian fashion. There
was a hitch in the case of the Wolton two,
Mrs. Wolton considering that this was a
splendid opportunity for substituting names
which had struck her fancy in a recently-
read story for- the old ones, whilst Wolton
objected on the score of the confusion likely
to arise. Only Holden’s whispered counsel
that "It’s not likely to make any damned
difference; they’ll still be called Dan and
Bill,” induced him to withdraw his objection.
“It’s as bad as branding a lot of young
colts,” commented Holden. “ ’Ere, Parson,
catch ’old. Y’ throat must be dry after all
that; a mug of this beer won’t ’urt you.”
Normally Brother Petherick did not drink,
but he took the liquor gratefully, and be-
came aware that beer had become general.
The congregation had dwindled during the
last of the christenings; lie found that the
men had commenced a procession to the shed
in which the liquor had been stored. Noav
trays of glasses and tin pannikins were
being brought to the women, and eatables to
stay appetites until the real feast was
handed round.
The Brother, feeling that some work had
been done that day, was warmed by the
spirit of fraternity that prevailed amongst
these people of the wide spaces who were
making a festivity of the rare meeting-time,
There might be an under-current of petty
envies and jealousies, but they were sub-
merged in the general feeling of neighborli-
ness. The events of the day had supplied
a reason for the reticence the Berrimans
had shown in speaking of the Holdens ; but
Petherick liked to remember they had’said
n 0 word that might prejudice the Holdens
in his eyes,
In the big shed, where the feast was
spread on improvised tables, and where the
now 7 -boisterous crowd was waited on by a
party of women volunteers who helped Mrs.
Holden and Millie, merriment prevailed, and
*row when the speech-making started. There
was rough banter, but a surprising delicacy
was shown in important matters • for in-
stance, Berriman insisted upon referring to
Harold and Millie as facing new experiences
The first speeches were made in an em-
barrassed fashion; but shortly everybody
wanted to say a few words; and Holden
himself, inspired by the praise of someone
who, after his first effort, had declared that
be “oughter be a member of Parlyment ”
rose time after time to propose some new
health and offer a few words. He was en-
joying himself properly
The crash of a portion of the improvised
tables as someone leaned against it and
the nodding of heads heavy with food e’xcite-
ment and beer, at. length presaged tne finish
of the feast. Once more Holden rose to his
feet.
"I wan’ your ’tension, all of yous !” he
roared with an urgency that wakened the
sleepers. “I think everyone’ll adsmit thish
weddin’ party’sh been a great sussesh.” I
A hearty roar of approval endorsed the
statement; but his hand was held un for I
silence. 1
“We gotter thank the parshon fer bringhr
us together like thish”—there was a salvo of
approval—“an’ fer doin’ things to ush which
should be done.” There was more noisv •
assent. “Everyshing’s been so sussesshful
that I gotter importan’ announshment ter l
make. Me an’ the missus wants you all
nat l ° ’ urr y away ’ome” (loud applause—
there was a general knowledge that there
was at least a cask of beer still unbroaehed)
“We want y’ll to sthay for a nuzzer sliere-
mony.”
The announcement was so portentous that
a hush fell on the gathering, all intensely
interested. Brother Petherick felt the in-
terest himself, and leaned forward to hear
the next words. When they came they
brought the worst shock he had received in i
a ministry he now fully realised was liable !

The Balloon That Never Returned
JAMES EDMOND
SPECULATES UPON WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN AIR-
SHIPS CLIMB A FEW MILES HIGHER.
A BRITISH balloon ascent which is
expected to be seventeen miles high is
mooted for an early date, and balloons
of various other nations are in training,
each air-admiral hoping to go up further,
or to say he went further, than the rest. A
new world was opened last May when
Picard, the Belgian, went up ten miles,
which is higher than known man ever went
before. He was fortified by the newest
breathing and perspiring apparatus, and as
apparatus becomes newer it is hoped that
machines will go higher. The end will be
when the final two or three dozen expedi-
tions go up and fail to come down again.
The vanishment of one or even of a few
might be set down to some ordinary and
quite understandable accident, but the dis-
appearance of twenty-four or thirty-six ships
with all hands will seem to imply that some-
where just above the top of the last record
the visitor takes a header into the super-
natural from which there is no coming back.
At one time there were almost certainly
plenty of mountains with unbreathable tops
—peaks which poked right above the atmo-
sphere so that our nude and unscientific
ancestor burst while exploring among the
foothills through lack of external atmospheric
pressure to keep his innards inside him.
Bucli still inaccessible knobs as Mount
Everest are the remnants and dregs of these
old geological monuments. In days of old,
about 175,000,000 years ago, the tallest bit
of dry land was 175 miles up, whereas about
five miles is now the limit, and the lowest
bit of sea-bottom was 175 miles down. How
far down it may be now is uncertain, for
no letters have floated to the surface, but
five miles is again suspected. The fact that
the mountains were washed down is proved
by the enormous stretches of alluvial plain
that everywhere interpose between the giant
ranges and the sea. The fact that the ocean
has been washed up is proved by these
stretches not being much bigger than they are.
The present situation makes the fate of
the world clear and beyond dispute. It is
hastening to its finish before our eyes. The
end will come by flattening out. When the
land levels down a little more, and the sea
levels up a little more, and the whole surface
of the globe becomes moisture with a depth
of. say, 2ft. at the shallowest part, man
will be done with. Napoleon’s Grand Army
met the same trouble on a small scale when
retiring from Moscow, and died of it. The
country was flat enough to satisfy anybody,
though there was higher ground beyond if
it could be reached. The moisture on top
of it was about 4in. deep, which proved
sufficient. The homeless army lay down in
it at bedtime, and to an increasing extent
it stayed down, as the human race in
general will do some day.
The race for top place in the upper air,
which is just beginning, will knock the race
for the Poles into a cocked hat. The great
question is: what will be the greatest eleva-
tion recorded until balloons cease to come
back with any news at all? There will be
a steady improvement in the art of keep-
ing the vehicle afloat on a minimum of
atmosphere, or possibly on no atmosphere at
all. There will be also a steady improve-
ment in the art of keeping the pilots alive
Avith artificial or imaginary air to breathe.
The next stage will ’be when the pilots are
frozen and the balloons bring them back
dead, with terror stamped on their faces,
along Avith automatic records and photo-
graphs of a staggering character. The height
Avill probably be 175 miles. The final
chapter will be when the balloons cease to
return at all, and when tAventy-four or
thirty-six of them totally disappear it will
seem safe to assume that the door (AA r hatever
the door may be made of) has closed against
further progress. Man may still potter
about in the lower strata (they will be called
lower then, though they are higher now),j
but. only suicidal millionaires will ascend I
indefinitely.
A feasible theory is that the upward-
bound traveller (whether he is dead and
carrying his soul under his arm as his entire
luggage, or alive and with many encum-
brances) comes at a certain height to the
entrance to the hereafter. I mean the
Private Hereafter for our human race only, i
I picture two gates—one Good and the
other Bad —of infinite size and invisible
materials and with an irresistible suction.
(They would be of invisible materials so
that the stars could shine through.)
Whether the passage would lead through an
infinitely large back door into a General J
Hereafter for the use of the entire universe j
is a matter about which it is difficult to
form an opinion. This is the point at which 1
knowledge stops and hope takes charge of!
the proceedings.
Sea Fear.
I can’t go down to the sea again,
For I am old and ailing;
My ears are deaf to the mermaid’s call,
And my stiff limbs are failing.
My eyes smart in the driving spray,
And the long lurch of the keel
And the swift plunge of the diving stem
Make me stagger and reel.
I can’t go down to the sea again
At the reeking, roaring town,
Where the motor-driven trollops lie
In a frowsty fog of brown,
And the white sails and the tall masts
Are no longer to be seen
On the dainty clipper ships that sailed
For Hull and Aberdeen.
I can’t go down to the sea again.
My eyes are weak and bleared,
And they search in vain for the gallant poop
Where once I stood and steered.
And the taut shrouds, and the ratlines trim
On which I leaped and ran
When I was a ’prenticed sailor-boy.
And reckoned myself a man.
There’s nought but wire and boiler-plate
To meet my wandering gaze.
Never a sign of the graceful spars
Of the good old sailing days!
So I will sit in the little room
That all old sailors know,
And smoke, and sing, and yarn about
Thp ships of long ago—
The Flying Cloud, the Cutty Sark,
The Hotspur and the Dart;
But I won’t go down to the sea again
For fear it breaks my heart!
S.A.
