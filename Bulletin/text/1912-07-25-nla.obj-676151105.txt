CAUTION. —The large sale for
“Emnenthol JUJUBES” has led to a
number of imitations being manufac-
tured under the name of menthol and
other jujubes. It is important, there-
fore, when buying to be sure and get
HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes. You
may be asked to buy other jujubes,
and be told they are “just as good” as
Hudson’s Eumenthol Jujubes. This
proves that these imitations and sub-
stitutes have no reputation of then-
own, and can only be sold on the good
repute and high character of Hud-
son’s Eumenthol Jujubes.

Varsos by William Blocksidge
TO A SKYLABK.
Brave melodist of bright ethereal meads,
Immortal master-singer to the sun,
Soul of all flesh-rid ecstasy that feeds
At streams where breaking thought is un-
begu n.
Where shall we match the measure that com-
pels
Thy rapid throat—the radiant roundelay
,hat cloudward runs on undeclining wings?
lis a too-natural canticle. Away!
And climb thou into the sapphire citadels
Of sound, thou single minstrel there that
sings ....
Thrice-blissful bird, all! say, that raptured
breath
By what mind-overgoing power impelled?
Or couldst unflood such happiness, say, if
Death
Thy brain with his heart-searing hands had
held?
Vain speculation! It shall never spoil
That lucent runnel dropping through the
skies
From where those circles of full sound thou
weavest.
Ah! could I but believe what thou believest.
And, like thee azure-housed, impetuous rise
And fill the world with song no pain could
soil.’
Away! thou tuneful lover of all light.
Less to the lorn dusk-guiring nightingale
Be given the praise, that takes with summer
flight.
Down Heaven’s steep scatter thy limpid
scale!
What divine mystery shall unmemory man
Up to such excellent madness? What shall
bless
Too-prcvalent being of its weighty bane?
Eh-all we first empty, ere they yield this span,
Ages not yet sown? Or never again
Clew out the riddle of unconsciousness?
ASHES AND CRUMBLED DUST.
Ashes and crumbled dust
Are heaped in holiest urns;
The mariner's shore-beacon must
Consume the while it burns.
In loveliest flowers are. found
Scents dedicate unto death;
The winging bird will feel the wound
While in liveliest breath.
Yes, turn me inhere I will.
There Dissolution’s hand
Each precious thing doth plot to spill
Into the ravenous sand.
Why, why must bliss and power
Ever at Death's door be? —
And why, my Heart, in my best hour
Hast thou forsaken me?
TO AUSTRALIA.
Thou sun-espouselled, well-belovdd Land,
Lo I, who practise in this precious trade,
Probation in remotest ways have made
For skill to endow thy yet-expecting hand.
Burning through shining hells of ravenous
sand
Fve gone; great mountains, meads that can-
not fade,
Stooping-old cities, seas, the nether shade
Of being and its laughing light are scanned.
I hope some cunning thence shall even form
Such fit things surely none shall find them
shamed
To say: He has limned out our larger soul.
With patience bear thou, then, this purpose
warm
That still lacks head, that would alone be
named
Honorable on our national scroll.
The anonymous author of that curious and
arresting book of verse. The New Life, re-
cently reviewed a*t length on this page, has
dropped his mask. His name is William
Blocksidge, and further volumes of his
work, like The New Life, privately printed
“in the tenth year of the Australian Com-
monwealth,” have come from the neighbor-
hood -of St. Mary’s Church, Torquay, Eng-
land. The new volumes are Southern Songs,
Moreton Miles, and A Northern Trail. An-
other, not forwarded, is entitled Sandal and
Gum. None of these collections of verse
achieve the strength and strangeness of The
New Life. All evidence acquaintance with
Australia; the versification is easier than in
his first work, the appeal weaker. His pic-
tures of the bush have sometimes a pleasant
touch :—
The kookaburra, like to a pedagogue
With ample forehead, eyeing lesser wits,
Doth now withhold his jocular epilogue,
And half adoze upon the pine-tree sits.
A Northern Trail shows something of the
crude thought of The New Life, oddly mixed
with rather dainty but rather imitative pas-
torals. There is, for instance, unadulterated
Blocksidge in “To the Jewish Maidens in
Whitechapel,” beginning:—
Jewish maidens, ye who dwell
In the hounds of Whitechapel,
Fair or pallid, fine or plump,
Eastward hailing of the Pump,
Hark ye, girls now, seeing I do
Into rime a song for you.
Moreton Miles is a series of lyrics telling
the story of the poet’s love for an Australian
maid. He asks Love to be grateful:—,
as overflowing
Tanks to thirsty men.
And his heart,
till riper hide reward,
Must do the barren spells,
As travellers in the West accord
Their walking to the wells.
By poem XLYIII, page 61, the maiden is
his. According to poem LVII the honey-
moon is spent in Brisbane: —
By Brisbane stream, that ebbs and fills
Through the city of brazen lulls,
Full many a jocund flower there’s grown;
But like my love no other one.
I am not afraid to bring her to town:
I brought her from Bundamba down,
My Logan lass, into the town,
A.ll unafraid: no fear had I
Town girls irould stale her put them nigh.
He is happy
Used was I not to pray
At all; but she has taught me
One prayer for night and day:
God shield the good she brought me!...
Wherever I go, each place among,
My love I keep from blame,
As tribes that more their camp along
Will carry the guarded flame. ....
As early squatters kept the streams,
As mountains keep the sea,
Beloved, in waking or in dreams
My heart is close to thee.
But she dies. The poem is written with a
naive simplicity that accords with its slight
theme. Blocksidge, when he has, learnt the
stern duty of concentration, may be worth
watching.
The Dangerous Age
One opens with some interest a book that
has provoked in Europe a torrent of frantic
discussion. The Dangerous Age, by the
Danish writer, Karin Michaelis (.Lane), has
been hailed as the book of this century, the
first book written by man or woman that has
told the whole truth about that mystic
thing, the woman’s soul. But is a woman’s
soul so subtle, so mysterious, so incapable
of analysis, so elusive, as it is usually repre-
sented (by men) in print? Because the
mental processes of women are different
from those of the male that does not neces-
sarily bar the masculine mind, whose busi-
ness it is to understand everything, from the
sympathetic analysis of those mental pro-
cesses. The male mind has grasped the con-
ception of fourth-dimensional space,- of. the
atomic theory, of the elements of psychology,
of the evolution of the universe—much more
complicated things than the soul of the
average woman. The eroticism of the male
has set the female on a pedestal in litera-
ture, but in life the brain of the male has
knocked that pedestal from beneath her feet,
and made her a comrade, granting her
supremacy in one indispensable function,
but relegating her other functions- —includ-
ing her mental processes—to a lower plane.
And the woman has hugged this literary
worship of the male to her heart. Woman,
being to; a large extent inexplicable to her-
self, has concluded that she must remain a
mystery to every other brain.
So to say that this woman, in her frank
confessions, has “betrayed the freemasonry
that exists among her own sex,” and has,
for the first time, exposed the female soul,
is greatly to exaggerate. The chief reason
of the interest aroused by this work is its
subject. The dangerous age for women, in
the author’s opinion, is what is known as
“the change of life.” The book consists of
the intimate journal of a woman of 42, a
wife who has remained strictly faithful to
her marriage vows, but whose heart has been
a vagrant. She is also a woman of pro-
nounced neurotic temperament; so to regard
this as a human document of the whole sex
would be absurd. It is a pathological diag-
nosis of a very limited feminine sub-class.
And one suspects, behind this lucid and
naive style the experienced author, the art
which conceals art; one doubts its pellucid
sincerity.
*>e
The heroine, Elsie Lindtner, arriving at
the dangerous age, leaves her husband-
divorces are easily arranged in Denmark—
and retires to a solitary villa tb tide over
-he*r “crisis” in solitude; and there she jots
down her confessions :
In reality I think there is more difference
between a man and a woman than between
an inert stone and a growing plant.. . .
It may safely be said that on the whole
surface of the globe not one man exists who
really knows a woman. They know us in the
same way as the bees know the flowers; by
the various perfumes they impart to the
honey. No more. How could it be other-
wise? If a woman took infinite pains to
reveal herself to a husband or a lover just
as she really is, he would think she was
suffering from some incurable mental dis-
ease. A few of us indicate our true natures
in hysterical outbreaks, fits of bitterness and
suspicion ; but this involuntary frankness is
fenerally discounted by some subtle deceit....
tetween the sexes reigns an ineradicable
hostility. It is concealed because life has
to be lived, because it is easier and more
convenient to keep it in the background;
but it is always there. Men can be sincere
both with themselves and others; but women
cannot. They are corrupted from birth.
Later on, education, intercourse with other
women, and finally marriage, corrupt them
still more....
Friendship between men is a very different
thing. Something honest and frank, from
which, consequently, they withdraw without
anger, mutual obligation, or fear. Friend-
ship between women is a kind of masonic
oath; the breaking of it a mutual crime*
When two women friends quarrel, they gen-
erally continue to carry deadly weapons
against each other, which they are only
restrained from using by niutual'fear
Smiles are a form of speech with which
we alone are conversant. Our smiles betray
our instincts and our vices; they reflect our
virtues and our inanity, But the cleverest
women hide their real pelves behind a facti-
tious smile.. ..No woman speaks aloud, but
most women smile a10ud....
The same enmity exists between two gen-
erations as between the sexes. While the
young folk, in their arrogant cruelty, laugh
at us who are growing -old, we, in our turn,
amuse ourselves by making fun of them. If
women could buy back their lost youth by
drinking the heart’s blood of their children,
many murders would be committed in
secret....
You see. Like most heroines in woman’s
books, this lady has had too much time to
think. She has lo'afed through life, a para-
site, with nothing to do but the analysis of
her precious self. A little pink, short-legged
and crumpled baby—or perhaps half a dozen
—and Elsie Lindtner would have had neither
the chance nor the inclination to retire to
her solitary retreat and write in her diary.
And even when she was there, she did no-
thing but loaf and idle. When the man
whom she is infatuated with comes to see
her, she finds that she cannot get into'the
white dress that he had once admired on
her. As she bitterly admits: “I eat too
much, and do not take enough exercise.”
The lover arrives, finds her an old woman,
and scurries away. To her dismay, her
divorced husband marries again, with better
luck, one hopes; and Elsie decides on a trip
round the world—with Jeanne of the silk
stockings.
A sequel lias already been announced.
The Japanese Pond
“On the bosom of the Pacific will be
decided, in peace or in war, the next great
struggle of civilisation, which will give as
its prize the supremacy of the world. Shall
it go to the White Race or the Yellow Race?
If to the White Race, will it be under the
British flag, or the flag of the United States,
or of some other nation? That is the pro-
blem of the Pacific.”
The appearance of Problems of the Pacific,
by Frank Fox (Williams and Norgate,
7s. 6d.), is timely and valuable, not so much
for the writing, for the book shows but little
originality of thought, and is “bumped out”
with much dead history, but for the insist-
ence upon the fact That the future of the
Pacific is fraught with world-importance-
indeed, that it has become what the Medi-
terranean so long was, and what the Atlantic
threatens no longer to be, the decisive sta-
dium for the last great prizefight between the
white champions of the world and the black
or tinted “hopes.” This is a point of view
which European chancellories have hitherto
hardly considered: out here, we know. In
calling the Pacific “the ocean of the future,”
Fox has rightly stressed the Australian and
Apierican view. Ilis book is a useful sum-
ming up of facts amply understood and
amply appreciated on the Pacific littoral;
but its value will lie more in its statement
of the case than in its personal conclusions.
For instance, his conclusion that “Japan is,
even now, dmong. the dwindling Powers ”
cannot be justified by any of the evidence
we possess. . ” . <
If the present position of affairs could be
accepted as permanent, there would be no
problem of the Pacific. That ocean would
be Japan’s home-water. Holding her rugged
islands with a veteran army and navy ; so
established on the mainland of Asia as to be
able to make a flank movement on China ;
she is the one “Power in being” of the
Pacific littoral. But the verdict of the war
with Russia cannot be taken as final. And
soon the United States will come into the
Pacific with overwhelming force.... The
permanence of the Japanese position as the
chief Power pf the Pacific cannot therefore
be presumed. The very suddenness with
which her greatness has been won is in itself
a prompting to the suspicion that it cannot
last. It has been a mushroom growth, and
there ;are many indications that the forcing
process by which a Power has been so
quickly raised has exhausted the culture bed.
....The position of Japan in the Pacific
seems to be that she cannot reasonably ex-
pect to win in a struggle for its mastery;
and yet that she will inevitably be forced
to enter 'into that struggle.
But nobody credits Japan with the fool-
ishness of waiting till her enemies have gath-
ered the power to crush her. She has yet
time to entrench herself, and in a land flow-
ing with wealth and opportunity, unless she
is stoutly met by the whites of this .conti-
nent. And the dilatoriness of the Fisher
Government over the initiation of the in-
dispensable straight railway to the Terri-
tory-—a spear-thrust at the invader —must
be to the Japanese one of the most inexplic-
able slices of luck that has ever befallen that
lucky country.
There is not the least doubt [ the author
recognises] that, given Australia, Japan
could establish a power threatening the very
greatest in Europe. Her fecund people
within a couple of generations would people
the coastline and prepare for the colonisa-
tion of the interior. An organised China
would put the Island continent to even
greater use.... The food production possi-
bilities of Australia make her of enormous
future importance. They make her, too, the
object of the bitterest envy on the part of
the overcrowded, hungry peoples of the Asi-
atic littoral. The continent must be held by
the British race. It would appear to be
almost as certain that it must be attacked
one day by an Asiatic race.
Fox also stresses the fact, not sufficiently
appreciated in this quarter of the world, that
the Anglo-Jap. alliance is dying of inanition.
But his complacent assumption that the
White, now so weakly entrenched on the
Pacific, is sure of the dominance of this
ocean, requires proof.
The future of the Pacific is with'the white
races. At the best, the Asiatic can hope to
hold his owu continent in security. Japan
had the chance of securing a temporary
dominance after the war with Russia....
With the opening of the Panama Canal, the
opportunity of Japan will have finally
passed. With the gradual re-establishment
of British naval power in the ocean, a Re-
establishment that will come through the
agency of Australia. Canada and Maoriland,
if not through the Home Country, and which
will be ‘‘anti-Asiatic” in purpose, a further
veto will be put on any aggressive ambitions
pn the part of. an Asiatic Power. But in
considering Japan, allowance must be made
for the danger of the people getting out of
the hands of the oligarchy which rules them.
The Japanese people, fed fat on praise of
their own prowess, may one day force a mad
course on statesmen asked to choose between
civil and foreign war. Such a war would
be doomed to failure for financial if for no
other reasons. But it might leave a deep
stain of blood on the Pacific.
And, if the future bf the Pacific is to the
white races, dominance in this ocean will
inevitably lie between the United States and
ourselves. Fox puts in a plea for friendly
co-operation between these branches of the
same race in securing the mastery of the
world's greatest ocean, and laying for ever
• the fear of the Yellow Peril. A pious hope,
the only chance for the realisation of which
is that it may be suddenly forced upon the
whites by the brown man running amok.
And if he does, we have thoughtfully pro-
vided an empty continent for him to run
amok in. And the author has not sufficiently
considered the greatest possible peril to the
Pacific whites—the probability of an offen-
sive alliance in two hemispheres between
aggressive Germany and desperate Japan.
In Altruistic Poems and Prose (obtainable
from the author, 658 George-street, Sydney),
George Birney tells us:—
This Book of Diamonds, rough, uncut,
Are not the Shams from every rut; -
They are from ah original vein of thought,
And for Two-and-Six they can be bought.
The rest of the book is rather like that.
The Australian Citizen, an elementary
account of civic rights and duties, by Walter
Murdoch (Whitcombe and Tombs, Melt).;
Is. 9d.), is a manual designed primarily for
the school, but is worth the study off women
and other animals who refuse to vote or
whose vote depends on the cut of a candi-
date’s, waistcoat and the steely refulgence of
his shirt. Murdoch writes with admirable
clarity, and he has covered a wide ground
concisely.
A collection of stories, some from The
Bulletin, written by Lilian Turner, is
titled Written Down { Ward, Lock)'. These
stories will suit the flapper who is worth
while, who looks in her reading for some-
thing beyond the prosiness of Corelli. Lilian
Turner’s heroines are commonplace little per-
sons, but their love affairs are touched with a
charming and delicate feminine sentiment;
there is an artless and genial skill in the
telling, and a tender pathos not unduly
stressed.
How they recognise literature in Paris:
A fund bequeathed by Edmond de Goncourt
awards each year a prize of £2OO to the best
work of fiction by a young writer; the pub-
lishing firm of Hachette dowered the Ladies’
Academy with a similar prize, bestowed on
a novel or a poem—this Academy firowned
Jean-Christophe, and discovered Marie-
Claire; and now the French Academy has
made its first award of its newly established
prize ot £4OO. The winner is Andre Lafon,
a writer only 25 years old, an undermaster
in a school. L’Eleve Gillis is only his second
book, his first being a book of poems. It is
a delicate study of a sensitive child whose
father, a musician, the reader gradually
guesses—-but never the child—is going mad.
IHE Times (London) says: “With such
rare gifts of language and psychology, the

has been fhrust. upon him so. early in his

IMPROVE YOUR
FIGURE.
You Can
Weigh What
You Should.
THIN WOMEN
If you are flat-
chested, ■ thin, run
down and scraggly—
even if you never had
a nicely-rounded bosom,
Dr. Falliere’s “Flesh-food” will' build you up
and develop your figure. Does your mirror
mock you ? “Flesh-food” will remote the faults
in vour figure by rounding out and developing
the" deficient places. Put up in Tablet form,
it is easy to use and pleasant to take, and, it
desired, may be taken secretly. Taken under
our directions, it will work wonders for your
appearance.
In manv cases bust measurements have been
increased by over ten inches, and the weight
over five pounds weekly. Other cases have
shown an increase in weight of even a pound a
day The average bust increase desired is
about six inches, and is readily accomplished.
FLESH-FOOD offers relief and development
to the thousands of chronically thin women
who have despaired of ever possessing a pre-
sentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food
treatment that adds weight and permanent de-
velopment to 1 ' attenuated /women.
FAT PEOPLE
Excess fat injures your health,
impedes your movements, and
makes you the butt of your un-
feeling normal-weight friends.
People who have been fat. and are
now reduced to normal, think
other fat people ridiculous.
Not alone does excess fat in-
jure jour health and endanger
vour existence, it absolutely
destroys your figure and makes you a dudicrous
sight.' Why do you stay fat? , FAl ’p U ,
positively removes excess fat, and will restore
your spoiled figure to decent and pleasing pro-
portions, and is always a sure and lasting cure
for obesity and corpulency. . A few doses im-
proves your breathing wonderfully, and tne
course, of treatment will cure you.
Is the only successful, and, at the same time,
harmless, fat-reducer that has ever been dis-
covered.' Its efficacy has been undeniably de-
monstrated in thousands of successfully treated
cases. It is totally and absolutely non-poison-
ous, and can in no wise work any injury to the
general health; though it often reduces excess
weight by as much as a pound a day.

Tobacco
Rills!
MOST MEN would
cure themselves of
the Tobacco Habit if
they knew they could
do so easily and also
without causing
themselves discom-
fort. . . . It takes but
ten minutes for To-
bacco to change the
bents of the heart.
To keep it up is to
tempt death by heart
disease, nervous col-
lapse, tobacco cancer
and stomach, liver or
kidney disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harm-
less, vegetable remedy that will make the
user of tobacco in any form absolutely aban-
don the habit for good. It not destroys the
craving, the desire, the appetite for tobacco,
but restores to health the entire nervous sys-
tern, and aids Nature in entirely eliminating
from the system the Nicotine Poison of
Tobacco.

Declare its name is Mud
The gardens surge about its feet,
And never, nevermore
The’ heart of loyalty shall’ beat
Within its noble door. :
The hats that once were, proudly cocked
Now wander .otherwhere.
The guards are’ gone, the’ dows unlocked,
The chambers free as air ;
Young Art a'n’d' Science long may sit
In these forsaken halls,
While pale Imperial! ghostlings flit
Like moths about the walls..
Here common men of larger brain,
And warmed with bolder thought.
May fashion for a Nation's gain
The thing before unwrought;
Or here’ in unimperial mood
Some artist’s soul may fire
A canvas splendid, vast and rude,
To match a world’s desire.
Base as the light, wrong as the sun.
Disloyal as the sea,
The little children’s feet may run
About these gardens free.
And maid and matron ’mid the flowers
May breathe this quiet, air,
Which none but Fat in gilded hours
Had any right to share.
The Times are dark, the Ways are-drear,
All Grovel seems to fail,
The swearful Voice, the falling Tear-
May nevermore prevail ;
But on one hope we take our stand
That well our need may fit,
They who haye now this job in hand
May make a mess of it.
Oh, blessed hope ! It yet may fall
That some vice-something show
Again this fair and sacred hall
In Solemn Joy may know,
And some proud thing more useless still
Than that we had before
May wake the old Imperial thrill,
And shut and lock the door.

Alas!
One Summer morn Love came to me
With tender' lips and kindling eye
We played together by the sea,
Then laughed and waved “good-bye.”
One dreamy noon Love came to nie
With fierce demand, and pleading cry—
We stayed together ,by the sea,
Then looked and kissed “good-bye.”
One starless night Love came to me
With faltering steps and smothered sigh—■.
We prayed together by the sea,
Then wept and said “good-bye.”

Hellas in Thessaly.
In Thessaly )av amid their sheep,
The :morn with pearl was grey,
The mists upon the mountains' were asleep,
The young wind -called the day.
One blew faint melodies upon a reed,
One drew, a bowstring >tight,
One watched a mossy fountain slowly bleed
World’s blood of clear delight.
Drop by slow drop it fell into the pool,
The gazer saw upcurled
Amid the wonder-shadows green and cool
The bride-veils of the world.
Blue smoke was in the dell below the trees,
Red shadows crossed the corn,
And somewhere at the cradle of the breeze
A huntsman wound his horn.
Dreaming in Thessaly young Hellas lay,
And sheep were all her care,
But shepherd lads upon a mountain grey
Saw her white morning fair.
One blew faint music on a hollow reed,
One drew a bowstring tight,
Apollo watched a mossy fountain bleed
World’s blood of clear delight.

BOILERS AND SUNDRIES.
Mr. McGowen, yesterday, soothed a deputation of
boilermakers, by saying he thought he could arrange
that no men would be imported until local men had
got jobs. —Sydney daily paper.
So the fiscal issue declines to sink, after all,
and Premier McGowen finds himself “up
against it.” The present N.S.W. Govern-
ment, and the party, State and Federal,
which it represents, has struggled long and
earnestly to ignore the great problem of im-
ports v. local production, but the question
can no more be permanently dodged than
death or drought or sin. Tariff and immi-
gration matters both belong to the Aus-
tralian Parliament, but McGowen has, pre-
sumably, a certain amount of influence ; and
he proposes to use it. Certain boiler-makers
are said to be unemployed, though the
demand for boilers in N.S.W. is enormous
and constantly increasing. The evil could
certainly be repaired by stopping the influx
or immigration of boilers, for the number of
cheap labor and “scab” labor boilers that is
coming into Australia is large enough to
account for a vast amount of unemployment.
And it might be repaired by stopping the in-
flux of boiler-makers —-or again it might not,
for if the influx of foreign boilers keeps in-
creasing it may soon be necessary, not only
to stop the arrival of boiler-makers, but to
drive away some of those who are already
here. Still, James McGowen, with his
usual boundless capacity for taking the
wrong road, proposes to do liis best to re-
strain the influx of people^— not the iullux
of goods. His position is that N.S.W., under
a State Labor Government and a Federal
Labor Government —in fact, under complete
Labor Government —has become such a
failure that its present population of about
5i people per square mile is quite enough
to go on with in these allegedly prosperous
days, and the addition of one more boiler-
may upset the balance.
The question of importing the boiler or
importing the boiler-maker opens up a num-
ber of side-issues. If N.S.W. were to import
the boiler-maker, and build the goods here,
it is plain that the boiler-maker would be
here. He could hardly help that. He would
collect his wages here, and spend them here
for the support of local tradespeople. He
would pay rates, taxes, railway fares, tram-
way fares, postages, income-tax (possibly),
land-tax (perhaps), dog-tax (occasionally),
probate duty (at times), drunk fines (it is
to be hoped rarely) in this country. One
reason why it is cheaper to pay £1 for a
local article than 18s. for an imported one
is that, out of the local £l, some 3s. returns
to the local treasury, while nothing returns
to any local treasury out of the foreign 18s.
Then the local boiler-maker would pay rent
here. He would help, indirectly, to keep
down rabbits. He would carry his share of
the public debt, and thus reduce the burden
per head. He would be available to hump a
gun in time of trouble, and might thus pre-
vent Australia becoming a yellow man’s
country, and the Parliamentary Labor party
being disembowelled by alien intruders. He
would vote for McGowen, unless that person
looked so hopeless that intelligent boiler-
makers would abjure him on sight. If the
boilers were made here, and the boiler money
was consequently kept here, it would be
much easier for McGowen to float his loans
here; and as floating loans is almost the
only political qualification he has, this is a
view of the case which should appeal to
him. The interest on the loans would be
paid hei'e, and spent here, and the receivers
of it would pay taxes here. There are many
other ramifications of the case, but it is
impossible, through lack of space, to follow
it to its logical conclusion.
On the other side of the question, the im-
portation of boilers means sending money
out of the country, and how badly that
affects James McGowen is evidenced by the
fact that he has lately been pursuing our
lost coin all the way to London, and offering
his lOU in exchange for it on terms which
almost amount to abject humiliation. Other
State Premiers have been doing the same
thing, simply because the cash that should
be available here has gone to Europe to pay
for boilers and other things, and the localcoin
market is growing very bare. Then the im-
portation of the boiler, instead of the impor-
tation of the man who produces it, signifies
fewer taxpayers, less revenue, a larger debt
per head, and fewer defenders. This last is
a serious item, for instead of a boiler-maker
to shoot for us there may be one to shoot at
us. The importing policy means that Aus-
tralia is a patron of cheap labor, and that
it offers all the encouragement it can to that
most useless, objectionable and chronically
Tory middleman, the importer. And, as
already mentioned, the bringing in of foreign
goods, and the sending out of local money,
cause Australia to be an abject suppliant in
London, advertising its poverty, holding out
its battered tile and its P.N. for some of its
own coin—or the coin that was its own till
it was sent away in exchange for cheap labor
goods—and respectfully asking the centre of
a mostly nigger empire to save a white man’s
country from insolvency. Also, there is pre-
sented the curious spectacle of the N.S.W.
Government, which professes to believe,
above all things, in eliminating the contrac-
tor and the middleman, employing the loan-
contractor, or loan-middleman (otherwise
the underwriter), to raise funds for it in
England, because that other middleman, the
importer, has been allowed to drain Aus-
tralia of its own cash resources. For a num-
ber of years past Australian loans were
floated locally on day-labor principles ; that
is to say, the borrower dealt directly with
the lender. This return to the old policy of
employing the British loan middleman is an
act of retrogression that can’t be excused
even if a dozen railways are built by day
labor.
There are abundant figures and evidences
to show that the situation is dangerous. The
trade returns for all Australia up to the end
of June are not yet available, but those for
N.S.W. and Victoria are to hand. They
show that, thanks to an inefficient tariff, the
two States imported, during the first half
of 1912, goods to the value of £26,746,945,
while they only exported goods to the value
of £19,599,771. That was a serious situation
for a pair of States which require, by reason
of their foreign debts and their heavy
toi’eign interest bills', to export a great
deal more than they import in order to keep
the account square. By way of helping to
make the ledger look fairly solvent, they also
sent away rather over £4,000,000 in gold.
That didn’t nearly balance the account, so
the foreign debt increased considei’ably ; yet
it represented a great deal more gold than
the two States produced in the time, and
amounted to a serious drain on their re-
soxxrces. The habit of importing boilers
instead of boiler-makers is fast emptying the
big safe in which this country keeps its
accumulations. So it isn’t sux'pi'ising that
artisans are unemployed, and that State
Governments are going very humbly and
politely to.the European money market, try-
ing to borrow back the boiler money on
almost any terms.
Both the Fusions —Labor and Liberal —
profess to believe in shirking the fiscal issue.
They use the word “sinking,” but they mean
“shirking.” If this country really faced the
questions that lie before it, instead
of loafing and borrowing, its indus-
trial organisation would be vastly
greater; its finances would be on a
much bigger scale; it would have to fight
big combines instead of small ones; every-
thing would be large, and large men
would be reauired to deal with the posi-
tion. It would be a matter of steering a
Titanic instead of a Balmain ferryboat. The
small men don’t clamor for big resoonsi-
bilities. They prefer to cut the continent
down to their own size. They are in the
position of the disastrous Bazaine, who was
reckoned a good commander of 30,000 men.
but a harried lunatic when he was placed
at the head of 180,000. It is easier to run
a comparatively empty country than a full
one, provided nothing special goes wrong.
It is much simpler to borrow money and
discourage immigration than to organise
great local industries. To leave the indus-
tries in somebody else’s country means leav-
ing the strikes, quarrels, riots and upheavals
for somebody else to deal with, and that is
very comforting. So long as the imperial
prestige lasts, and the Jap or the Chow isn’t
too unpleasant, and the good old foreign loan
floats regularly, and the old age pension and
the invalid pension and the baby bonus are
agreeable and consoling, the fiscal issue can
be sunk pleasantly enough. The arrange-
ment saves trouble for a time, which is
also the case for a time with the man who
sinks the Ten Commandments, and is wholly
non-committal about the Deity and the
Devil. But if the financial stress grows
much worse in London, Premier McGowen
will have to speak a great deal more plainly
to the next deputation of unemployed boiler-
makers.
MORE ABOUT SIGNED JOURNALISM.
Fob the past two or three weeks the Tory
daily press, when it has had nothing else to
do, has risen up and filled in a spare moment
by denouncing the proposed system of signed
journalism. And it has denounced mightily,
with the admonition, and the less and
greater excommunication, and the anathema
maranatha (which is lifelong and cannot be
shifted), and the “reserved excommunica-
tion,” which is a specially large and hulking
rorin of unpleasantness, also the bigger disa-
bility and the out-size in fulminations.
Then it got its second or third wind, and
objected by bell, book and candle, by all the
saints and all the holy water, also by the
sacred groves, and the high places, and the
tombs and bones and ghosts of 'its ancestors.
And, having done ail these weighty deeds, it
tied a wet towel round its ear, and went
to bed to rest, so that it might wake up like
a small giant refreshed and resume objurga-
tion at the old stand.
Getting down to details, the burden of the
plaint is twofold. First of all, the Tory
press claims that all its articles are virtually
signed already, because the publisher puts
his name to the whole paper, including the
lost dog advertisement, and the announcement
of Jane Smith’s marriage to Samuel Hogg,
and takes the whole nominal responsibility,
often for a very moderate salary. That
plea is palpably unconvincing, because
everybody knows that the publisher’s signa-
ture, in this connection, is bogus. He
doesn’t write the whole paper. As a rule, he
doesn’t write a line of it, and often he has no
control whatsoever over its contents. In
many cases he no more knows who wrote a
specific article than he knows the name of
the horse that dragged any particular stone
for the building of the Great Pyramid.
Therefore, this kind of signing isn’t a guar-
antee of accuracy. The average publisher
doesn’t help to keep lies and misrepresenta-
tions out of the paper. He isn’t ashamed —
nor is he expected to be ashamed—when they
get in, for he probably wouldn’t know a lit-
erary lie if he saw it. He doesn’t lose his
literary reputation over the matter, for, in
a general way, he has none, and doesn’t want
any. Then the Tory press advances a second
plea, which is that papers are truthful, reli-
able and accurate, even without the guaran-
tee which would be afforded if writers had,
personally, to carry the obloquy attaching to
gross ignorance or gross misrepresentation.
They are truthful and reliable, because a
discriminating public demands it, and only a
paper with the lamp of veracity constantly
burning on the premises can expect support.
This tale is, if possible, more absurd than
the other one. It implies that papers are
quite useless, because they only exist to tell
the public what it knows already. As the
public knows already, it immediately bowls
out the unreliable paper with its discerning
eye, and as it is so absolutely honest and en-
lightened that exhortation is wholly super-
fluous, it visits its displeasure on the
misrepresenting journal by withdrawing its
subscription and its advt. Yet, as a matter
of fact, the public knows little, and doesn’t
discriminate much. If it was otherwise, a
multitude of affluent papers would be born
dead. And as for the burning and shin-
ing lamp of veracity, that article of furni-
ture is hardly heard of on many newspaper
premises, and would be only regarded as an
encumbrance.
Let a few cases be selected at random:
How many hundreds of times have the Sydney
morning papers said, or implied, that the
concession of the Federal capital to N.S.W.
was the only condition on which that State
could be induced to join the Commonwealth?
And who would imagine from that tale that
N.S.W. gave a majority for Federation at
the first referendum, leaving the site of the
capital an open question; that the affirma-
tive vote was many thousands in excess of
the 50,000 which N.S.W. had agreed with
the other States should be a sufficient mini-
mum, but that faith was broken and the
acceptance annulled by a gang of liars and
traitors in the Legislature of the day, and
that it was by this act of repudiation that
the whole question was re-opened and
possession of the capital secured? Again,
the question of the diverse railway systems
comes up periodically in the Sydney dailies,
and not long since the most intensely respect-
able of them all had an article about what
it called the “freak gauge” (the sft. 3in.)
of Victoria, and the absurdity of that State
expecting N.S.W. to stand any part of the
cost of converting its lines to the uniform
4ft. BHn. Victoria, the plea ran, had com-
mitted an act of supreme folly in setting up
an outlandish gauge of its own, and must
pay for it. No one reading that story'
would guess (and few would trouble to find
out) that N.S.W., Victoria and S.A. com-
menced with an agreement for a uniform 4ft.
84in. gauge; that N.S.W. broke faith, as
usual, and arrogantly demanded the sft. 3in.
gauge; and that, when it had carried its
point, it went back to the original 4ft. Biin.
System, without even informing its neighbors,;
and only after they had got so much work
done that a change on their part was next
to impossible. Then, again, who doesn’t re-
member the Six Hatters’ lie and the Petriana
perjurv; and the famous Ananias of the
early Federation days, about how the other
were “living on” revenue contributed
by N.S.W.? And, to take a sneciallv brazen
instance, in the days of the Federation cam-
paign, when every mean and dirty falsehood
that could be invented against the other
States was considered good currency among
certain Sydney anti-Federalists, there ap-
peared in a very prominent organ an impas-
sioned article about the unbrotherliness of
Victorians in levying a crushing duty on
N.S.W. coal. The duty didn’t exist. It
was devised for the occasion. Yet a large
section of the ignorant commercial class, for
which the importers’ paper especially caters,
believed the yarn: No rush of public obloquy
compelled the publication to mend its ways
and speak the truth. All it got was a rush
of advertisements. The distortion was
pointed out over and over again, but it was
neither withdrawn nor apologised for. And
at a later date, quite a number of Tory
papers published lists of sham or bogus or
imaginary mileages to bolster up their de-
mand for a deviation of the Port Darwin
railway into the eastern States. Anybody
who took the trouble to consult a map could
see the size and grossness of these fabrica-
tions, but the parochial press trusted to the
apathy of the public, its habit of taking
things for granted, and its additional habit of
assuming that lies are justifiable if told in
the assumed interests of the liar’s own State.
* * * *
These are only a few instances among
hundreds. People with some shred of politi-
cal decency or honor or fairness, or with
some scrap of patriotism about them, may
object to this variety of political warfare.
That is to say, they may object, if the paper
which published the huge invention in its
most conspicuous page allows them, when it
feels so inclined, some obscure, unnoticed
corner to object in, while it probably goes on
printing the invention conspicuously all the
time. These people can’t sue the nominal
publisher for being a disgraceful slanderer of
his • untry. Even if he were responsible, it
unfortunately happens that the one libel for
which there is no redress is libel upon the
community. There is nothing to be gained
by personally abusing the nominal creature
who puts his name on the tail end of the
daily organ. He is, in most cases, a mere
clerk of a sort. He can’t even be walloped with
any satisfaction. But a sort of remedy lies in
making the literary prostitute or the literary
incapable who writes this sort of thing put
his name to it, and thus carry his own dis-
grace in public. This has been tried in a
small way. The reason why the Labor party
begins to believe in signed journalism ail
round is that it has made a casual experi-
ment with the system and has found
it pay, so far as things have gone.
Under the existing law all political articles
published during a Federal election cam-
paign must be signed. Straightway there
disappeared out of the Tory press the free-
love lie, the bursted-home-and-disruption-of-
the-marriage-tie lie, the wholesale confisca-
tion lie—in fact, all the best and largest and
most garish anti-Labor lies which, a very
few years ago, were the regular stock-in-
trade of Toryism. It may be that Toryism
had been deceived in the old days, and has
now been struck with a smattering of educa-
tion or a shred of knowledge. It may be
that Toryism has repented and taken its
front hoofs out of the trough. Or, again, it
may be that, though the Stagnant Party-can
find men to write the most reckless and un-
principled fabrications, it isn’t easy to find
men who will endure the public and personal
shame of signing them. The Labor crowd,
naturally enough, takes the last view. It
realises that the one and only time when it
got any sort of a fair deal from Toryism was
when signed journalism was the law. Con-
sequently. it regards the system as good, and
for that fact Toryism is wholly responsible.
If the old gang had been as virulent, as
brazen, as arrogant, as lop-sided and as un-
scrupulous under the signed-article policy as
under the old, anonymous method, then Labor
might have reckoned it had made a mistake.
Toryism has persuaded it that it made no
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Port Which Has Had Its Day.
Last week the coast of N. S. Wales was
swept by something unusual in the way of
gales. One result was that, for days,
several big steamers were unable to get into
Newcastle, which, from a business stand-
point, ranks second to Sydney. According
to Captain Millar, of the Ivapunda:—
The sea was breaking three miles from the New-
castle entrance. Throughout Sunday and Monday,
the Kapunda was kept head on to the sea. On Tues-
day morning there was little or no improvement,
but the steamer was steered for Nobbys again. Three
steamers were met, all waiting to cross in. They
were the Wakatipu, Werribee and Brisbane.
The signal, “Bar dangerous,” was flying from
Nobbys, and then he made up his mind to return to
Svdney.
If a man had half a dozen and
if five of them were speedy, easy-running
and reliable conveyances, while the sixth
was an ancient ruin, which could only be
induced to be of any service at all by end-
less and costly repairs, he would not waste
his time and money over the derelict-
assuming, of course, that he was in his
right mind. However, a State that is
chronically controlled by Governments which
are under the domination of that State’s
capital city looks at things differently. New-
castle may be said to stand for the out-of-
date and well-nigh useless vehicle above-
mentioned. It was not a particularly satis-
factory refuge even in the wayback days of
small ships and leisurely trading methods.
Any port which stands at the mouth of a
great river is badly handicapped from the
start. It is necessarily a bar-harbor, and
sometimes —as in the case of Newcastle —it
is such a serious sort of bar-harbor that,
when the ocean breezes blow, the sea is liable
to break three miles from the entrance of it.
Under those conditions it becomes not so
much unsatisfactory as calamitous. At
the present time of day, the Newcastle
'variety of port is an anomaly. Yet succes-
sive State Governments have financially en-
couraged it for all they are worth, and
there are indications that the McGowen
administration intends to follow the ex-
ample of its predecessors by spilling further
cash on the hopeless place. The merit of
Newcastle in the eyes of the fervent Syd-
neyite lies in the fact that it isn’t good
enough to be a serious rival of Port Jack-
son. It is the safest port to spend money
on between Cane Howe and Port Danger,
for, though millions are squandered on it, it
can never rise above its natural disabilities.


Under a Government which considered the
welfare of the State alone, and was not
mainly concerned to aggrandise Syd ey,
Newcastle would be firmly scrapped, so to
speak, by the Treasury authorities, and
such money as was available for harboi
development would be ex ,P en(^ <i q 0 Wnlp „
several ports up and down the N. S. Wale
coast which are likely to show some return
for the labor and cash lavished upon them.
But N. S. Wales has never had that sort ot
Government, and by the present look ot
things, it never will.

About Bull and aJßoil and a Bill.
Maoriland expects a surplus this year of a
million, or a billion, or a cubic mile ot money,
or something else that is large and strenu-
ous. Maoriland finances are always inter-
esting. So long as the big foreign loans last
the boom lasts, and as long as the boom lasts
the surpluses and the revenue expansion
last, and as long as the surpluses and revenue
expansion last, the obvious soundness or the
country’s position endures and .lustilies more
loans. Unhappily, when you have a very
tall house of cards —one that is growing
taller every day—it is difficult to prevent a
sudden breeze blowing on a card somewhere.
Every card is tottery, and. the more cards
there are the more surface is exposed to the
breeze. The situation recalls an old tale
or lie concerning a business man who averted
a crisis by discounting a forged bill. When
it fell due he retired it with the proceeds of
a bigger forged hill —it had to be bigger, for
the discount had to be provided tor. Ihe
method was so easy and comfortable that in
time he gave up work to a great extent, and
came to live almost wholly on forged bills,
and as the discount and his own living ex-
penses came out of the proceeds, each batch
had to be more numerous than the previous
one. As the number of bills afloat increased
it grew harder to keep track of them; but
still that man’s obvious prosperity was
something wonderful, and his surplus was
surprising. But one day, owing to a boil,
he forgot to retire a bill in time, and it was
presented and repudiated, and all the money
that he had borrowed to develop his amazing
natural resources fell due at once, some-
thing of the same sort may happen to
Maoriland. One day Bull may have a boil
when the bill falls due, and may forget to
renew. Then he will perhaps discover that,
to a great extent, he has been lending on his
own security—that his own loans .made a
great deal of the apparent .prosperity that
impressed him and led him into making the
new loans.
A Vast and Splendid Scheme.
Shout of enthusiasm from “10-2-4” :
Defence Minister Pearce has evolved a scheme
that should help considerably to engrave his name
on the imperishable scroll of Fame —or what not it
it comes off. His idea is to resume Redleaf and
Glenyarrah, two big Double Bay (Sydney) estates,
and 'turn them into one vast barracks. The cost
will be a mere bagatelle. True, the houses, which,
are among the largest private residences in Sydney,
will have to be paid for and then scrapped. But the
land on which they stand is not worth a penny more
than £2O per foot. The Government may acquire
the additional 22 acres that are needed, if it has
luck, at as reasonable a figure as £l5, or , e Y® n
£l3 per foot. It is a matter for regret that the
country, in these parts, is not as level as the Plains
of Lombardy. As a matter of fact, it is the reverse.
Much of it suggests, as regards gradient, the side
of a cathedral. However, when the precipices and
so on have been planed down, it will be all rig ■
The Parade Ground is to be on what is now Double
Bay—an item that Will involve the filling-in ol a
acres of the harbor. The water averages 1 ■
depth in this locality. But what of it ? The modern en-
gineer thinks no more of filling in o 7 acres of ha b
than the modern contractor does of presenting bis
bill for the job. Then there are jetties, a sea wall,
landing steps, shelters, and the like, to be built,
not to mention the tearing-down and removal of tne
two mansions that now encumber the site; also
construction of ordnance scores, and brand-new oar-
racks and their manifold appurtenances.
There are some subtly valuable P oi nts J? 1
Pearce’s proposition that may elude the thoughtless,
feather-brained, tap-room, or tram-riding class 01
critic, unless his attention is drawn to them, l he
inevitable effect of the scheme— assuming it is
realised—will be to send down the value of house
property in Double Bay and environs with a rush.
Rightly or wrongly, the virtuous burgher who in-
habits a prosperous suburb has no sort of use tor
what he is accustomed to term ‘the scddiers .
King,” at close quarters. On a distant battlefield,
in the final act of one of those bellow-dramas which
are all National Anthem and Union Jack and gore
and heroism and blither ; or as a prop for a wilting
Empire Day address, the lad in khaki is well enough.
As a near neighbor the right-thinking classes are solid
in regarding him as a drunken, boisterous, quarrel-
some and embarrassingly amorous nuisance —in brier,
as a human calamity. .
The South Head-road is already one of the most
hopelessly congested thoroughfares around, Sydney.
The reason , is that it has to carry practically -the
whole of the traffic between Woollalira and Watson s
Bay When a few thousand hefty and agile soldiers
are suddenly added to the crowd which daily ' a h d
■nightly fights for a place in the Double Bay trams, r the
Eastern Suburbanite will begin to find himself foot-
ing it briskly to the city and back on about two
week-days out of every five. , ...
A Barracks is an inspiring affair to read or talk
about, or to see depicted on a cinematograph him or
in an illustrated paper, but as a thing to live near
it can only be described as rotten. The sta.cca.to
howls of the drill sergeant, the incessant bugle-
blowing that seems inseparable from the military
profession, the badinage of the warriors, their sports
no less than their labors, are intolerable from the
standpoint of the gentle little man who hurries hack
from a strenuous day’s invoice-faking to do a bit oi
quiet, liver-stimulating toil in the garden.
For these and other reasons the construction of the
barracks will hardly have begun before the present
residents of Double Bay and environs will be streak-
ing for fresh parts, as though chased by devils. That
will he the opportunity for the .authorities, State
and Federal, to start acquiring, at bedrock prices,
charming sites for all sorts of public utilities.
What better position, for example, for the Zoo
that is shortly to be shifted from Moore Park, than
Point Piper? Bellevue Hill will afford a com
manding site for the gaol that now lurks m com-
parative obscurity at Darlinghurst. There should be
room for a superb Reception Home for Inebriates
on the foreshores below Cranbrook, and, if not, the
harbor can always be filled m for half a mile or
rn °When S all* 1 these institutions have been built, when
there are a couple of lunatic asylums overlooking
Rose Bav, when: the Morgue gazes down on the
waters of Farm Cove, when an is in. full
work at Vaucluse, then indeed will sound administra-
tion be justified of itself, and. the name of Pearce
be engraven indelibly on the scroll of Fame, as fore-
shadowed above and hereinbefore mentioned.

A VERY old Yankee gag—the writer first met
it when he was helping to run a paper at
Rockhampton (Q.) in 1885—about
taxes,, was lately worked oft on a Maoiih
land royal commission at Auckland by the
secretary of the local “land values league.
He was endeavoring to expound the high
cost of living,” and professed to describe one
day in the life of a local citizen. His yarn
was a great deal too long to quote, but here
is about one-tenth of it:
He blacks his boots, taxed 22$ per cent with
blacking taxed 20 per cent., hammers on a heelplate
taxed 22J per cent., and puts in a new pair of laces
ta He seats P himsdJ in a chair taxed 25 per cent. at
a table taxed 25 per cent., with his feet on a rug
taxed 20 per cent., resting on a linoleum taxed 20
per cent. ; drinks, say, coffee or cocoa, taxed 3d. per
lb., out of a cup taxed 20 per cent., and eats bacon
taxed 2d a lb, potatoes taxed £1 per ton, off a
plate taxed 20 per cent.; eats bread made of flour
taxed £1 per ton, and butter taxed 2*d. per lb., jam
tnvpd 2d a lb., honey taxed 2d. a ib.
Breakfast finished, ' he goes to the mahtel, taxed
25 Der cent., takes down his pipe, taxed 20 per cent.,
filVit with tobacco taxed 2 s to 3s. 6d. per lb., and
lights it with matches taxed 2s. per gross of boxes.
And so on, ad lib. Of course, Maoriland
grows its own bacon and potatoes and bread
Ind honey (and mostly it makes its own
table and chair and mantelpiece and boots)
And there being no excise duty on these
things, the citizen doesn’t, so far as they are
concerned, pay any of the taxes above enum-
erated. There is a law which says that the
man who uses certain imported goods shall
be taxed just as there is a law which says
that the man who does certain things shall
be hanged, but the . law no more
taxes everybody than it hangs every
body Yet the Freetrader has such a crav-
ing for foreign goods that he has really per-
vaded himself that this country grow
nothing and makes nothing, but imports
everything, and doesn’t send away anything
to pay for it with. When he has really
arrived at the idea that Maoriland imports
its flour and potatoes—from England, pro-
bably—and pays customs duty on them, he
seems to have about reached the limit. h>ut
then it is hard to say what is the bmit where
a Freetrader is concerned. He is the sort oi
blatant madman who has no limits.

agreements party in Maoriland d ° * see ™

Melbourne Metropolitan Gas Co., having
been shamed, scared, bluffed or bothered
into restoring Id. in the Is. to the well-to
do 1 victims of its extortion, has roused its
needier customers to indignation by leaving
the nenny-in-the-slot rate unamended.. lhe
proposed reductio'n of 81-3 per cent, in the
nr ice of gas is a sop to. large consumers
who use the commodity in manufacturing
business, and a crumb of concession to house-
holders who burn it by the 1000 ft. tor cook
ing and lighting purposes. To the working
man whose “missus buys her gas by the
penn’orth as she goes along, because the
monthly-meter system came more expensive,
the bloated co. makes no concession at all.
Nor does it even offer the barren comfort of
a reasonable excuse for keeping the price
up. Granting that the present penn orth ot
gas is a fixed measurement, which couidn t
be increased with the existing stock ot
machines, there is no earthly reason why one
penny out of every 12 dropped into the slot
should not be returned to its feeder. In re-
ducing the gas rate from ss. to 4s. id. per
1000 ft. the co. practically instructs its col-
lectors to refund Id. in the “bob” to all con-
sumers whose meter is “taken” once a month.
But all the pennies in the slot-meter box are
to be grabbed as oefore. A modicum of pro-
fit-sharing principle is conferred on the
wealthy owners of gas engines, and with-
held from the small retail customers. Which
is very characteristic of monopoly!

There is not the least reason why the
recent amazing report of the N. S. Wales
Totalisator Commission should delay the
arrival of the machine. Parliament knows,
as well as the man in the street, the un-
'savory influences which were brought to
bear on certain members of the absurd body
that has just finished tearing about Aus-
tralasia, to no purpose, at the taxpayers
expense. It knows, also, that the minds, of
certain other members of the Commission
were made up before any investigating what-
ever was done, and that no arguments or
evidence would have altered their views. In
brief, the Commission was a farce from the
start, and it has finished its “turn” in an
eminently fitting manner. It did the com-
munity one unavoidable. service, and one
only, inasmuch as it elicited a quantity of
evidence in regard to the Totalisator. Fully
90 per cent, of that evidence whs powerfully
in favor of the Tote; the rest was more or
less against it. The members of the Commis-
sion hardly made a pretence at deciding the
issue before them on the evidence. But there
is no justification for Parliament following
their example. The obvious thing for the
Government to do, in view of the various
facts that were put before the Tote Com-
mission in the course of its expensive wan-
derings, is to firmly discourage the Private
Bill business, and bring in a measure of its
own for the legalisation of the machine. Un-
fortunately, however, Governments rarely do
the obvious thing.

“R. E. Monstrance”: After N.S.W. At-
torney-General Holman attacked the present
anonymous system of writing and printing
our noble newspapers, about the two most
(ostensibly) enraged journalists in New
South Wails were J. A. HoCxUE and Joe
Niesigh. They tackled Holman, coram
populo, which is to say that they rose up
before the A.J.A. and put the case, for the
stupidly heroic (or heroically stupid) pro-
prietors of the “great dailies.” The S. M.
Herald said, in its nice, dignified way :
Some of the facts of this problem were set out by
Mr. Niesigh and Mr. Hogue at the Journalists Asso-
ciation on Tuesday afternoon.
But the S. M. Herald forgot to mention
that “Jimmy” Hogue and “Joe” Niesigh
owe more to the simple fact that they sign
and have signed their names early and often
than to anything else. So impressed was
“Jimmy” Hogue with the living, urgent
necessity of using his name (and why not?)
to reinforce his views, that when, the other
day. he got word by cable from the editor
of an English review that an article of his,
signed (and why not?) was about to appear,
the said “Jimmy” Hogue immediately in-
formed Australia of the fact by writing a
signed letter to the papers—preparing them
to receive cavalry or repel boarders ! And
“Joe” Niesigh— well! For the last three
solid years my friend “Joe,” who now stands
up to curse Holman, has lived and flour-
ished on the Sydney Sun, by having his
name printed large over every special article
he wrote! Once more is the adage verified:
“No person named Joseph was ever entirely
satisfactory.” Bet me ask Messrs. J. A.
Hogue and J. W. Niesigh to shut up!

A front-rank Australian architect’s criti-
cism of the prize designs for a Common-
wealth capital in the Yassberra wilderness:
Magnitude and color captivated the judges. Quan-
tity beat quality. Theories beat evolution.
The Chicago landscape-gardener is an old cam-
paigner. He covered soft, of canvas with longi-
tudinal sections, cast impossible shadows in a
stagnant lake, and tickled the fancy with browns and
slabs of gold. He placed spider-web octagons on
undulating country, and concentrated traffic at their
hut, — anc i Sydney knows what congestion of traffic
means. About one-half of the building blocks as
plotted lie north-south or east-west—a fatal defect,
for the south elevations would remain in shadow
continuously for seven months in the year.
The Finlander (placed second) submitted a series
of pictures well worthy of the home of the midnight
sun. They are truly magnificent examples of draughts-
manship. The street system is original, defying the
demands of rapid traffic-movement. It is a net-
work of French curves and semi-ellipses, the very
antithesis of the direct route, a bewilderment to
the citizen, a maze to the stranger. The police force
in such a city would require lessons in navigation to
enable the force to direct the stranger how and
where to go. How such a “lay out” caught the
affection of the judges is quite incomprehensible.
The Frenchman (third prize) not only lays out
the city, but adds 100 square feet of canvas, with
daintily painted glimpses, and a series of clever views
of architectural monuments not required by the . con-
ditions. any more than the Chicago man’s mirage
shadows in the lake. As to his “lay out, he
secures compactness at the cost of street surface. Any-
one could do so with streets 30ft. and 50ft. wide.
The French design has streets as narrow as that, and
the judges said nothing. They never even issued a
report. They simply said: “One, two, three!
Of the three premium designs the Frenchman s is
easily best as an intercepter of sunlight. Orienta-
tion with each of the three designs was more an acci-
dent than, deliberate planning. The valleys of the
site lie north-east and south-west; hence the site
dictated the main arteries for roads and drams.
Concerning the Molonglo \ alley, the Yankee
weired the stream and formed lakes, then built up to
the foreshore and forgot about the storm waters.
Result, a stagnant lake. The Finlander canalised
the stream, formed a number of right-angle bends,
and evidently trusted to some future generation to
feed the canal by a long pipe from the Snowy River ,
for a canal of the character portrayed by the Fin-
lander must, to be wholesome, be fed bv a head ot
water of considerable volume. The 1 renchman did
not know what to do with the Molonglo, and left
We Next°to" the lack of appreciation of sunlight, the
most vital defect in the three boss designs is un-
the failure of all to indicate how they
would dispose of the storm waters and the surface
waters from streets and back yards None of the
three prize-winners showed an intelligent apprecia-
tion of Australian conditions, and all forgot that in
Australia there are cities which offer precedents in
traffic arrangements.
Dear Bulletin, —I hate to be offensive to
anybody, but I think the need for signed
journalists is much less important than the
need for unsigned barristers. It is very true,
as Mr. Holman says, that a pressman
might write powerful articles in favor of
Freetrade for £lO a week, and then, when a
rival paper offered him £l2 a week, he might
write equally strenuous articles in favor oi
Protection. It is horrible to contemplate
such a thing, and the very idea makes my
bald spot stand on end, and my vanished
hairs go down with borrow to the grave. (In
speaking of “borrow,” I refer to the fact
that Brother Holman earns his official
salary as virtual leader of the maddest loan
party that N.S.W. has ever seen, or heard
of, or been cursed with; it being, at the same
time, a party which is pledged to the reduc-
tion of loans, and the expenditure of loan
money only on permanent and reproductive
works which will pay full interest on their
cost, and sinking fund, so that this party
got my vote on false pretences.) But, to
come back to the point at issue,. I reckon it
is a regrettable thing to see a signed barris-
ter upholding any and every cause which
he is paid to uphold, and doing it at the in-
stance of a signed solicitor, and before a
signed Judge, and all because he has received
a good signed cheque from his client. Fur-
thermore, I think that every member of the
Liberal or Labor caucus ought to sign his
opinion, even if party discipline drives him .to
vote against it. And I think we ought to
have signed bishops, for the habit of con-
cealing the real name and simply writing
at the foot of a letter, “Alfred X, Central
Australia” is a subterfuge. And I abso-
lutely clamor for signed kings, for when
one of the tribe is described as “Geo.
V.,” as if “V.” was his surname, when we
know it isn’t, and never was. and never will
be, it makes me tired. Having said these
things, I arise with a shout of public con-
cealment, and, suppressing mv real name,
hereby designate myself, Yours truly,
Henry Horsecollar.
Professor Meyer, of America, a railroad
expert of sorts, has been telling the Mel-
bourne people that the city’s swollen girth
is due to hard-and-fast railway rates in favor
of the metropolis, at the expense of the
country. And the conclusion he arrives at
is that State ownership is a rotten arrange-
ment, and that Victoria should forthwith
hand its railways over to Private Enterprise.
In the U.S. the railways belong to private
companies, whose main policy is to create
and maintain numerous big inland centres,
which act as expanders of the railway traffic.
The Yankee railway managers practise all
sorts of rate devices, such as “outer port
differential rates on exports” : extreme dis-
crimination on imports billed through to
interior cities, and coming through outer
ports : the long and the short haul practise,
etc. In fact, the railway companies use dis-
crimination to help trade to . flow in its
natural direction. In Australia, the prac-
tice has been quite the reverse, for here our
freights and fares are framed to drag every-
thing, humans and commodities, to the capi-
tal cities, at the expense, firstly, of the other
seaports, and, secondly, to the disadvantage
of the inland cities. It is demonstrably wrong
in a score of ways, but State ownership is
not to blame for it. A foolish or corrupt
private railway co. might be guilty of the
same malpractice. And. furthermore, the
thing isn’t unalterable. The State railways
can easily imitate the .Yankee private rail-
way corporations. It is only a matter .ot
Government ordering the Railway Commis-
sioners in each State to think less of the
merchant in the capital cities., and more ot
the trader and manufacturer in the country
towns. The centralisation policy could be
changed entirelv in one week. The position
is that Australia does not want to boot, out
its Socialistic railway system, as a condition
precedent to having the trains, run on equit-
able and nationally beneficial lines. What it
needs to do. for its own good, is to boot out
of public life a number of its anti-decentral-
isation, Melbourne-and-Sydney-bloating poli-
ticians.

The want of confidence motion in the Vic-
torian Assembly, although doomed to. defeat,
was not a mere time-wasting device like
Affable Alfred’s attack on . the Federal
Government. It forced Premier Watt to
make a full report on the managerial
methods of the Victorian Railway Commis-
sioners, as regards their purchase ot hard
ware from foreign firms. The Commission-
ers in the time of the glorified Tait, and
from long before the time of Tait, right
down to the present day, have left the plac-
ing of European contracts to their ch.iet
engineering adviser, Woodroffe, whose faith .
in the products of three old firms dates back
to the dim past, and has steadfastly shut
out new light from the subject. The pro-
ducts of those three firms were, in Wood-
roffe’s opinion, the best obtainable when he
first shared the Vic. Government orders
among them, and any subsequent develop-
ments in competition didn t matter. Com-
petition, in fact, was ignored. Lenders from
other makers were not invited, and not
until Woodroffe shifted the bulk of his
faith to the one German firm of Krupp from
the two English members of his chosen
trinity did the Age raise the cry that the
Government was flouting its own nominal
policy of “preference to Britain.’ Woodroffe
seldom, if ever, looked beyond the chosen
trinity of exporters, and the Commissioners
never called their chief engineer to account
for his bigoted Toryism. He had the cour-
age of his ancient prejudices, and was
allowed to enforce them; therefore Premier
Watt’s full confession of the facts and
figures T 6 Railway contracts placed in
Europe reflects less discredit on the. Com-
missioners’ adviset; than on the Commission-
ers who accepted his advice when they should
have been well informed of its bias. If Tait,
the vaunted man of figures with the instruc-
tions to “make the Railways pay, should
have been prompted to see that the Depart-
ment was buying its materials in the best
market, what about the minor Commission-
ers who had been watching the game for
years before Tait —from Canada —came upon
the scene? The present Chief Commis-
sioner and his coleagnes have grown up in
th“ Vic. Railways. They ought to possess a
general knowledge of. everything they deal
with in their managerial capacity, and, seem-
ingly, they don’t.
urged on by Elwood Mead Victoria’s
Watt Government has decided that the
“time has now arrived” to apply the com-
pulsory water rate principle to all the irri-
gated districts of the State. So the land-
owner will in future have to pay ss. per
acre per annum in return for one acre-foot
of water—which he may use or not as. he
pleases—and already the moan of the swind-
ling Rodney proprietor is loud in the land.
This progressive move is expected to put an
Comfort in Adversity.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The fact is that the States are now expending
loan money at the rate of £ 15,000,000 a year, or
equal to £45,000,000 for the three years. That
looks like £80,000,000 being required to be raised
in that period, if the present rate of expenditure on
loan account is to be maintained. There is some of
the debt falling due upon which a renewal of the
loan can be counted upon. But the great bulk of
the above £36,000,000 is London money, and it will
take 10 loans, of an average of £3,000,000 each, to
cover them. That is how renewal loans interfere
with the issue of loans for the construction of new
works. In the past half a dozen years a number of
Australian loans have been placed in London.

Loans?
Yes! We see them rolling round us like the
billows of the sea —
Some weird fate has almost drowned us in
a flood of £ s. d. !
Good, hard cash in which we wallowed —•
Cash the Sands of Time have swallowed.
Lokd ! to think that it is ended —our i man-
cial Jamboree!
Loans?
Why, it only seems like last week that we
raised that monster Loan
To “extend our railway system” from Goat
Flat to Skinandbone.
Though the line was never finished,
Just because the field diminished —
And to think that old Loan’s due now, and
that thirty years have flown!
Loans?
Well, there! It’s most surprising how the
blasted things fall due!
And the Cost of Living’s rising, and were
older —Me and You !
But I notice these Debentures,
Unlike other human ventures,
Skip across the generations like an ambulat-
ing Jew!
Loans?
Confound ’em! They’re a nuisance —as per-
sistent as the waves!
And this interest’s just usance for which
Australia slaves!
Four per cent, is pretty weighty !
Why, that Loan we got in ’Eighty
Has been paid for nigh twice over —yet the
hungry beast still raves!
Loans?
Then—dash it all!—a Nation should be
prone to look ahead —
To—er — neiv accommodation, as well as
what is dead!
And it’s very aggravating
To find Uncle hesitating
As he slowly counts the corpses in the
Money-Morgue outspread !
Loans ! ! !
Oh, well, there’s no help for it, if the
blessed time is up !
Blow the terms, and raise it somehow — any-
way before the Cup!
Ten or fifteen loans won’t matter,
And they’ll make the fat years fatter. . . .

end to the foolishness of carrying water
through miles of sheep runs in order that
one genuine agriculturist may irrigate a
60-acre farm distant half a week’s journey;
but naturally the owners of the huge blocks
that are still locked up against settlement
can’t see the beauty of it. An even more
bitter wail than that of Rodney comes from
the adjacent district of Deakin. Deakin
has so far escaped water-taxation altogether,
though Rodney has had to pay Is. 3d. per
acre these few years. Naturally insol-
vency loomed, so Deakin must pay for its
water rights—ss. per acre per annum. It
isn’t a heavy rate, comparatively, and it
only affects some 50,000 acres in Deakin;
but 20,000 of those 50.000, in the richest
corner of the Goulburn Valley, are held and
used solely as sheep-runs by five members of
the Winter Irving family. Instead of
watching the golden fluid running by, and
paying nothing, those five landowners will
now have to part up £5OOO per annum, and
will have to irrigate, cultivate and generally
bog in, or else sell to those who will. All
this is very touching, in more senses than
one, and the landlords will condole with
their fellow-legislator IrviNg on the disas-
trous effects of Labor legislation and the
policy of driving capital out of the country.
Of course, Labor didn’t inaugurate the policy,
and capital is being introduced instead of
being driven out; but little details like these
don’t trouble Landlords.
On Tuesday of last week —which was the
fatal fourth day of the recent south-easterly
“buster” —the “Deaths” column of the S. M.
Herald chronicled 16 passings out. In four
cases no age was given, hut the others ran
thus—3B, 15, 84, 66, 93, 85, 84, 84, 82, 67,
86, and 76 years respectively! Talk about
the Fatal Forties! Twice that age seems to
be more fatal, not to say fashionable. These
cold Antarctic “blows” are very wafts of
Death to the sprightly octogenarian. Who
was it said that “he who safely passes a
winter’s day escapes an enemy”?
Another carp from this paper’s Old Sol-
dier :
One Lieutenant Alexander, formerly of the Scots
Greys, directed the following at Senator Pearce’s
dept, the other day:—
“Bayonet exercise is not taught to the Common-
wealth troops. And the officers scarcely know how
to draw their swords from their scabbards at all.
In such a state, leading their men in an assault, they
would be like lambs going to the slaughter.”
In how many recorded instances have infantry suc-
cessfully charged with the bayonet during the past
40 years? They could be counted on the Angers of
one hand. As for the infantry officers’ sword, it is
simply a survival of barbarism apparently retained
by the Commonwealth as a concession to those of its
officers who yearn to look blood-thirsty and terrifying
at social functions. In the Boer war the infantry
officers abandoned their useless swords and carried
carbines. Most of the officers of the 21st Lancers
charged at Omdurman, carrying nothing but riding
whips. It is still an open question whether cavalry
with the “white arm” thoroughly well mounted, anil
trained to “shock tactics” might be useful IF LED
BY THE RIGHT MAN, in the battle of the future.
Sword, lance or bayonet come into play “after the
bring has ceased,” but it is the business of the in-
fantry officer to see that it does not cease on his side.
As for the people in his front who are bring at him,
he knows that when they stop bring they have had
enough, and only want to get away. They will not
wait for the bayonet.
The Bulletin’s Bitter and Rejected
Artist writes :
The present exhibition of the Vic. artists is a
triumph for Mr. Potboiler. Little of the work rises
above the dull, dead level of ordinariness, and still
less achieves artistic distinction. Even Bernard Hall,
that master of bilious backgrounds, is not his convinc-
ing graceful self. His largest effort, “The Black Hat,”
shows an uninteresting lady, apparently devoid of
emotion and nervous force, and is merely a pictorial
platitude. Leslie Wilkie’s large subject, “An Eques-
trienne,” has a pleasing, sun-spotted background, but
the foreground gee-gee has a perilous resemblance to
a rocking-horse. Albert Enes dashes about as usual
with a vivid green brush as his chief article of faith.
With the exception of “A Frosty Morning,” which is
worth applause, his landscapes seem to merely cele-
brate Ireland’s patron saint. His two big portraits
of an elderly lady and gent, are excellently drawn,
but, somehow, they fail to hold the eye. Percy Lea-
son hangs a work called “Respite,” a study of thirsty
explorers and yellow earth, somewhat recalling John
Longstaff’s “Burke and Wills,” yet sincere in its
effort to dodge the conventional. “The Sceptic” of
W. B. Mclnnes, .described as “unbnished,” is as
deftly composed as a piece of mosaic ; and Miss Gum-
brae Stewart’s jotting of Henley Day is quite an en-
joyable contribution. Mrs. Muntz-Adams’s items are
so encrusted with color that they demonstrate the
triumph of pigment over design. The landscapes of
J. S. McDonald reveal the artist’s passionate insist-
ence on the delusion that Nature arranges trees as a
maker of carpets arranges his designs. His profound
faith on this point covers a multitude of remarks
which might be made, but aren’t. McClintock’s
water-colors, however, are entirely charming; and
“Nature’s Tranquil Mood,” by Montague Brown, is
soundly painted, but is just a tribe oleographic. Tom
Carter’s portrait of Miss Elsdon Storey is pictorially
decorous, but fails to grip. Miss Jo Sweatman, the
instigatpr of “The Shady Hat,” ought to be slapped
with a feather for accentuating the importance of a
dimpled chin. In his numerous slight canvases, Alex.
Colquhoun shows tolerable craftsmanship ; and Doug-
las Richardson, in his “Rising Mist,” suggests popu-
lar confectionery. The modelling of Richardson’s metal
bgure, Cain, almost goads one into enthusiasm, and
the etchings of John Shirlow make one forgive some
of his brethren for their patent shortcomings. John
is a notable etcher, and displays a portrait of Ber-
nard O’Dowd, which is infused with some of the
poetry of his distinguished sitter.

The Quinlan Opera Co., at Her Majesty’s
Theatre, galloped through a rapid procession
of first nights, and produced several operas
which Sydney had not heard before. Only
one, “Tristan and Isolde,” arrests the ear.
It came as near being a pot-boiler as its
great composer could climb down to. Even
genius can write uncommonly well for a sav-
eloy, and Wagner’s short-of-cash condition
drove him, in 1857, to a sudden dash at
the music of “Tristan.” Yet the work con-
tains some of the finest orchestration any
collection of fiddlers can wade into in one
evening. “Tristan” crawled over many diffi-
culties, however, and was kicked out at Vienna
after 57 rehearsals, owing to what has been
vaguely described as “the incompetence,
physical or otherwise, of the tenor, Ander.”
This was in 1864, and the extra saveloy was
not in the Wagner frying-pan yet. “Tristan”
struggled to the surface after a generous

helping of the Order of the Boot, on June
10, 1865, in Munich. Tenor John
Coates was commonplace in the vocal
gems that embroider the story of the
man who loved Isolde too much, also too
late. Her matrimonial proposition, Mark of
Cornwall (Allen Hinckley), though an
Arthurian type of kinglet, did not take
kindly to a Lancelot on the premises. Agnes
Nicholls, as Isolde, repeated in “Tristan”
the triumphs she scored in “Tannliauser,”
and the house rose to this fine Wagnerian
artist with a series of “curtains.” Edna
Thornton, as the maid Brangaene, and the
melodious Parker, as the sorrowful minion
Kurvenal, were first-aids to the wholesale
death-scene which brings the curtain
down on an impromptu morgue—the
sort that ought to gladden the heart
of any undertaker in the audience.
Knock and his orchestra and the fine
work of the chorus helped to push “Tristan
and Isolde” into the front place as the best
Quinlan production to date.
Tenor John Coates made his first artistic
success in Sydney as “Lohengrin,” on Mon-
day night. Coates seemed to take the vocal
art more seriously as the silver-plated knight
with the white fowl on his head than in any
previous part in which he has expanded hi's
burly chest. Before retiring to his watery
nest on the Scheldt, John Lohengrin sang
the explanation that knocked Elsa into an
early Brabantian faint, and did it with a
skill and tenderness he’d been hiding under
his jacket for 10 days or so. Why Coates
doesn’t always rise to his Holy Grail stan-
dard is an operatic riddle.
“The Girl of the Golden West,” whose
first appearance in Sydney occurred at Her
Majesty’s last week, is bad bellowdrama.
Puccini’s last opera deserves to be hanged
by the score till it falls dead at the feet of
the man who devised the original work. Of
its kind, and before the shawm and psaltery
came and trod on it, “The Girl” was one of
the best examples of a stirring play which
just missed the ltirid line of “bellow.” The
situations move rapidly to a dramatic con-
summation—a thing devoutly prayed for by
the gallery which hands out bouquets or
bricks without fear or prejudice. Puccini has
taken a story and beaten the heroine to death
with drum and cymbal. Above the uproar
rose the voice of Coates, whose robust (not
to say, Falstaffian) tenor was able to drown
the elephantine crash of the orchestra from
time to time. Jeanne Brola, an emotional
actress of the Margaret Anglin species, was
the Girl who is adored by the boys in the
Californian camp. Quite incidentally, she
sang the leading role. Her tremolo may be
forgiven, for the tornado of sound which
Puccini calls “grand opera” pounded in vast
waves upon the shores of the Girl, and if
she- had by any chance been a bar-harbor, she
would have been quite unapproachable. How
she survived the storm was a marvel. Bobert
Parker, as the poker-playing Sheriff with
a hole in his morals, had better opportuni-
ties, and practically carried the Girl on his
shoulders till the dead finish.. Parker’s huge
voice roared like a Bulli breaker above the
storm fiends of drum and cymbal. His make-
up was an episode in dramatic craft. Con-
ductor Voghera was in charge of the hurri-
cane. His name should have been Foghorn.
* * * *
Harry Diver, for years the sneering villain
of melodrama, and for years before that the
very excellent lago and the fine character
actor, has to call “Time” after many years’
plucky battling against illness. Few people
of the audiences who saw his shocking crimes
night-after night knew that the perpetrator
left the stage half fainting, and that mere
breathing became agony after the struggle
m which he used to throw tl;e heroine over-
board, or cast her blighted child to the four
winds. Years ago, when playing Nelson
( the Mariners of England”) in Adelaide, he
suffered hemorrhage during the last act. and
tlie curtain fell on a dead Nelson who seemed
dying._ All the theatre folk of Sydney have
organised a benefit matinee at the Adelphi
for August 1. The Quinlan opera co. will
lift up the best top note, and the “Kismet”
co ; will represent the people who live on
friendly terms with camels, and “The
Night Birds,” and the “Bad Girl” co., and
Allen Doone, and the Tivoli, and other vaude-
ville people will stuff the programme full of
merit. Hugh Ward is president, and a com-
niittee of much financial and social tonnage
is behind the movement. The treasurer is
George Willoughby (Adelphi Theatre). Go
thou and do likewise.
Corpedian Charles Zoli, who makes a brief
appearance in the second part, provides the
most _ humorous item these nights at the
Tivoli. Dressed in Spanish costume, he
sings to a chattering castanet accompani-
ment, how his wife left him and fled with an
accursed bullfighter. His impassioned re-
marks about his wife, and his murderous
promises regarding the bullfighter, are sand-
wiched in between gracefully furious dances.
It is an hilarious mixture of Billingsgate and
Old Castille. The Webb Brothers’ musical
clowning, Alec Hurley’s songs, and the fool-
ing of Niagara and Falls are the other main
items of the bill. Frank Sidney continues to
clear the furniture like a bird, and to smudge
a lady’s complexion in his flight; Fanny
Powers sings agreeably; and Fred Bluett
has a full hand of cheerful ditties.

The attention of Amphitheatre patrons is
riveted at the time of writing on Miss Bessie
Slaughter. She is the owner of a vast and
harmonious contralto voice, and as her songs
are as easily picked up by the untutored mul-
titude as a Chapzander hymn, her success
is complete. Francis G. Curran is a trapeze
artist whose efforts are the more gratifying
by reason of the fact that he has but one leg
—in fact, to use the management’s scholarly
neologism, he is a monopede. Miss Lyla
Thompson is still there, and the same guarded
remark applies to Billy Watson and the
Waldrons.
❖ ❖ ❖
“The Bad Girl of the Family” will be
given two more nights in which to attempt
to live up to her reputation at the Adelphi.
On Saturday night “The Girl Who Loved a
Soldier,” a comedy-drama by Wilton Welch,
of the Marlow co., will fill the Bad Girl’s
boots. The plot of the new piece is laid in
Sydney and suburbs, it being one of the very
few Australian plays whose headquarters
are not a gumtree. Included among the
scenery are views of Sydney harbor and the
blowing up thereon of an over-inquisitive
submarine.
In the Crystal Palace rush J. D. Williams
has not forgotten his other three Sydney
picture theatres, and their films are still of a
high order. The Lyric attraction to-night
is “Resignation.” A child is on his death-
bed, and the mother becomes hysterical, and
rails against Providence. The doctor admin-
isters a sleeping potion. She dreams that
her son is grown up, and gets into bad com-
pany, is expelled from college, forges his
father’s signature, and finally attempts to
commit suicide. Then she awakes, and
learns that he is dead, and in an illogical
sort of way she thanks Providence that he
lias gone in all his innocence. Why he should
have come, ir his only chance was to immedi-
ately go again, is a question that she doesn’t
enter into. “The Redemption of Greek Joe,”
for the Colonial No. 1, is a mining-cwm-love
yarn, and includes some good mine-explosion
scenes. At the Colonial No. 2 “Dick Tur-
pin” will hold the fort. The picture repre-
sents the first of his adventures, where the
degraded and hog-like ruffian steals a cow,
and then sinks to deeper iniquity and prigs
a horse.

After Friday evening, “The Wearing of
the Green” will be discontinued at the
Palace, and “Sweet County Kerry” put on
its place. The change is not being made on
account of the sudden wearing-out of the
green, for it is a deathless color, and never
needs patching by Allen Doone or anyone
else. Allen just thought a change would be
good for the public, so “Sweet County Kerry”
it’s going to be, and you’re expected to attend
and sigh for the shamrock even if you hail
from Russia and think “acushla” is Spanish
for “onion.”

Adelaide Literary Theatre, which lately
rather went back on its principles and put
up “The Rivals,” has returned to them (not
the Rivals but the principles) with Oscar
Wilde’s “Duchess of Padua.” It is a fine,
gloomy tragedy, with only one fault, that it
apes the Elizabethan too closely. Guido is
sworn to kill the old Duke, murderer of his
father. (The Duke might be innocent, and
the ancient who fills the youth with informa-
tion and revenge might be lying, and nursing
a private grudge; but this fine sub-motive
comes to nothing.) Before the Time is
Ripe for killing, Guido is in love with the
young Duchess, and declines the butchery or
meat business. She is amazed at his scruples.
Then events move rapidly. She kills the
Duke. He repudiates her. She accuses him
of the murder. He, after long claiming to be
allowed to tell the truth, suddenly lies heroi-
cally in her favor. And they die together
comfortably in his cell. The play is full of
fine lines, sometimes Shakspearian, as where
he calls his murderous lady “O damned saint,
O angel fresh from Hell!” —but mostly
modern : “There is no love where there is any
guilt.” This sentiment the ancient thinks
silly: “That was in Palestine, not Padua.
And said for saints; I have to do with
men.” In happier times, Guido has the
charming and Wilde-like sentiment: “When
a man loves a woman, then he knows God’s
secret, and the secret of the world.” The
acting was distinctly good. Miss Jean Rob-
ertson, whose one fault is being too statu-
esque, simply had to get moving as the
charming murderess, and did her best work.
So did Arthur Smith, one the rare ama-
teurs who can either curse or make love
without looking absurd. Wilfrid Neill, as
the old Duke, gave a brilliant imitation of
Irving as Louis X 1.,. and the minor parts
were (mostly) well taken. The Literary
Theatre, playing in a suburban hall, wisely
made no attempt to realise 16th century
Italian architecture, and merely draped the
stage with dark curtains, which werfe ac-
cepted as amply suggestive.
Other Adelaide shows have been various.
James Bryce, most warmly received, has
shown his wise, tortoise-like old head in
various places, giving a series of brilliant

Louis Esson’s comedy took its turn on the
Melbourne Repertory stage when this Bul-
letin was going to press, so the question of
its fitness for exploitation by purveyors of
popular entertainment is held over for a
week. The Australian play was the third
and last production of a Repertory season
which started at the Athenmum Hall last
Thursday with a revival of “What the Public
Wants.” Practice has improved the co.’s
handling of Arnold Bennett’s ironical tri-
bute to Harmswortliian journalism. The
master spirit of the piece (played by Gregan
McMahon), appeared heroic when he was
previously submitted to the disrespect of the
Soulful. This time he loomed rather brighter
than before. Worgan, the millionaire news-
paper proprietor, bears no envy, hatred and
malice to Culchaw, like the bulk of the
people whQ read his publications. He is the
Democrat who feels very friendly to Cul-
chaw, and is prepared to put it on a sound
financial basis whenever it can offer good
security for the investment.

“The Seagull,” translated from the Rus-
sian, had its one consecutive performance on
Saturday. Apart from the very foreign
scene of an open-air theatre (where one
young lady declaims to an audience of six
concerning the sky and the earth and the
shellfish in the waters under the earth),
there is nothing that conveys any sort of in-
formation to the thoughtful minority, or that
the unthoughtful majority could get enter-
tainment from. It is Ibsen minus Ibsen’s
stagecraft. Two of the characters are con-
spicuously abnormal. A dyspeptic young
woman, wißi a defiant slouch, takes to alco-
hol and,cigarettes on account of an intensely
egotistical youth who aspires to write plays
and short stories, and who ultimately com-
mits suicide because his girl—the one who
declaimed about the shellfish —has lost her
heart and borne a baby to a more human
litterateur. The mere man in question had
been previously captured by a wilful actress,
who happens, by the way, to be the mother
of the morbid youth. Her rational fondness
for the practised writer and sentimentalist
suits both of them well enough, and after he
has passed through the illusion of love for
the girl who preferred him to his morbid
junior, he becomes as closely attached to the
middle-aged actress as ever he was. But,
whereas lie had only, loved the verdant spin-
ster for a little while, she remains faithful
to the father of her child. If she had re-
frained from adoring the successful novelist,
and had married the morbid youth, she
would probably have been left a widow,
instead of a spinster with a child. Her hus-
band would have suicided on account of some
other unobtainable pebble on the beach. By
the same token, the f cigarette girl would
doubtless have been soon cured of her illu-
sion, if she had got the'chance to marry him.
The volatile matured actress and (lie senti-
mentalist who regards his emotions as valu-
able stock-in-trade, seem likely to be happy
to the end. All this, expressed incoherently
by amateur mummers in a humorless play,
is very tiring. The Repertoire Co.’s best
placed and most artistic representatives in
this long struggle w r ere Lyle Christian, as
a superfluous old gentleman who had wrecked
his constitution by leading the simple busi-
ness life, and Miss Maud Jolliffe, as the easily
sinful actress. Her kindred spirit (Gerald
Carr) finished a good third. The Russian
play was preceded by a translation of a Nor-
wegian dramatic poem, with musical accom-
paniment. Loaded with uncouth names and
strange references to matters of foreign his-
tory or romance, the poem was a trying task
for Miss Rose Quong. _ She spoke it and
acted it like a born artist.

“The Quaker Girl,” at Her Majesty’s
(Melbourne), is quicker and crisper than on
the first night. The sparkling Champagne
Danse and the tuneful duet re “Mr. Jere-
miah, Esquire,” happen considerably be-
fore 11 a.m., instead of somewhat
after the hour. If a few of B. Wright’s
frequent allusions to his deceased parents
were wiped off the slate, “The Quaker Girl”
would lose none of its attraction. Wright’s
laborious efforts to be amusing, in a part
which has no intrinsic funniness to speak of,
are not all in vain. Sometimes the little
man is truly droll, but his work as a whole
reminds one of the ham sandwich that is
mostly bread. Yet he can be commended
for not declining to the level of a mere beef
sandwich. Fred Leslie, who gets good oppor-
tunities for humor as the policeman with a
fully descriptive limp, appeals to fastidious
palates with the subtle persuasiveness of an
unbuttered scone.
The amorous adventures of George the
Fat were originally embodied in a French
farce, probably a good deal more naughty
than Gladys Unger’s English version, which
eventuated at the Princess’s on Saturday
night. This is a farce of the painfully
machine-made variety in which the mislaid
schemes of the hero gang monotonously
agley. At no time does the play begin to
be convincing, and frequently it ceases to be
amusing. It lacks dramatic interest, for
much the same reason as did a very different
circumstance, “The Passing of the Third
Floor Back,” because its machine-made
situations can be guessed in advance by the
very greenest theatre-goer. It is as inevit-
able that George will make love to and
appointments with every female he meets as
it was that the Stranger in the hashhouse
should “convert” every person who came
within the influence of his silver wig and
curate-like smile. The fat that cheers the
mummer’s heart belongs mostly to Harry
Plimmer, who plays the unstable one, and
looks cherubic and irreproachable in pink
and white pyjamas, and to Lizette Parkes,
who is Micheline —a sort of flapper edition
of Katherine the Shrew. The decorative
Lizette is equally charming in her most
natural and most artificial moments, and her
unstockinged limbs in the second act almost
moved this paper to cheers. Titheradge is
his easy and natural self as Lucien, a part
which has probably suffered by Anglicisa-
tion; and Harry Sweeney is passable as a
valet whose more frivolous moments are
devoted to the reading of Schopenhauer. Miss
Beatrice Day, as a lady from the ’alls, who
wanders into George’s bedroom late at night
and smashes the crockery when she finds out
that she is not his “girl,” deserves praise,
and several others, including Mrs. Brough,
are undeserving of blame.

The necessity for teaching children of the
female persuasion the rudiments of wire-
walking, so that they may escape when a
villain endeavors to fry them in an upstairs
room, is being nightly emphasised at the
King’s. To this paper the most impressive
feature of “When London Sleeps” is the
extreme sadness of the ladies who lead the
gay life at Helliwell Mansion. In this abode
of festive sin the proceedings are conducted
with much more decorum than the Quakers’
meeting in the next street, which is nightly
interrupted in an unseemly manner by Bertie
Wright. One visit to such a place as Hilda
Can-ode’s demi-public house must inevitably
put a stop to a rake’s progress and cause that
disillusioned bloke to rush back along the
straight and narrow path that leadeth to
maddened bun-fights, fu'rious choir practice,
and vegetarianism that is over the speed
limit.

If there was any room left for novelty
in a performance by five “ground” acrobats,
the Hans Paxton troupe has introduced it
into its “turn” at the Opera House. The
Paxtons are a polished combination of two
adult males and three small ditto, who make
everything they do look easy, and accomplish
many things that would have been wonderful
10 years ago. The hurling of one boy back-
wards into the air by see-saw propulsion,
that he may be caught, hands to hands, by
one of the men is perhaps the cleverest feat
of the series. As for standing upside down
on somebody’s head, it is apparently a mere
detail in Paxtonic daily life. The De Serris
pictures have abated none of their artistic
beauty. Fred Russell continues to be the
freatest ventriloquist under the canopy of
leaven, and the Stavordales are quintetting
on string instruments as before. Also, Rich
and Rich are repeating a dualogue, which
grows poorer and poorer on acquaintance.

To-night (Thursday) and to-morrow will

Melbourne, nor is that beauteous fowl going

Also, Water and Cat will be transformed

The Cisneros concert co. triumphed suffi-
ciently over the terrible temperature of Mel-
bourne Town Hall last week to account for
two extra concerts this week. One of them
has passed into the history of local song,
and the other is to happen to-morrow
(Friday) afternoon, when General Desire
will probably prompt the impressive prima
donna to repeat the chord that falls on her
fevered spirit like the sound of a grand
Amen. Also, it is practically certain that
Dufault will again declare himself captain
of his soul in his most defiant tone of voice.
It’s a fine thing to be captain of your own
immortal spirit. The writer sometimes blows
a whistle and tries to feel like the bo’sun,
but he never yet presumed to climb the bridge
ahd bid himself heave to.

Last Saturday, Spencer excited his Mel-
bourne supporters with “The Post Tele-
grapher,” a war drama that gives a fair imi-
tation of an embittered scrap without worry-
ing about the rules of military science. A
similarly thrilling effusion was “The Lesser
Evil.” Mamma’s best boy, who became a
bandit, was the idea embodied in “The Price
of Silence”; whilst the most notable thing
in “The Pasadena ‘Peach’ ” was the desire
of several bad characters to hug the fruit.
Of the comic films the chief was “The Vapor
Bath,” a pictorial impertinence which en-
deavors to raise a horse-laugh by liberal dis-
plays of persons in their night attire.
“INCONSTANT GEORGE."

Georgie Porgie, nice but queer,
Kissed whatever girl was near:
When, however, there were two,
Georgie knew not what to do.
He could ne’er make up his mind
Which was loveliest. We find,
In the first act, he has three
Oharmbrs on his hands; ah me!
Lucien’s flighty wife, Odette,
Fernande Chantal, and Vivette—
Siren of a music hall —■
Georgie is beloved by all.
He cannot decide on one,
And is really true to none.
Three appointments does he mix!
Georgie Porgie’s in a fix !
Act 11. is a bedroom scene:
(George is still in the tureen)
He is told he’ll have to make
Up his mind which girl heill take.
Pretty flapper Micheline,
Sweetly innofcent and green ;
Loving George, she visits him
In his bedroom, in the dim
Morning ! In pyjamas gay
He receives her, and a way
Out of all his troubles sees:
He will “chuck” the other shes.
Tenderly he prints a kiss
On the sleeping flapper. This
Ends the “great pyjama play.”

HARRISON O.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Hullo”: Re “The Prodigal Son,” ah early example
of Debussy’s work, which the Quinlan company pro-
duced last Saturday in Sydney, ) am disappointed. I
always thought that the old father was a small cocky
farmer in the backblocks of Palestine. But it ap-
pears from this show that he lived in a palace of
Egyptian arcmteccure, or something resembling the
same. Evidently the date paim season had been good.
As a matter of fact, there was no visible fodder
around save date palms, so I presume the animal
so much mentioned was either a tree-climbing calf, or
else a calf 80ft. high. The animal didn’t appear, so
the glad parent didn’t slay it with an axe up against
the footlights, and cause the blood to spurt into the
orchestra stalls. Nor did the eldest son appear, nor
the kid that he complained that his father didn’t
give him that he might make merry with his friends
—fancy growing wildly hilarious over goat junior!
In fact, the only visible stock on the home farm was
a mob of ballet girls in excellent condition. It was
probably the news of this herd that brought the prodi-
gal so swiftly home. He had seen nOtning so nice
among the husks. Humnerdinck’s fairy opera, “Han-
sel and Gretel,” followed. Here an interesting point
in natural history was the fact that several of the
angels who watched over the sleeping children wore
their wedding rings.
“Harrison O.”: Paul Dufault, the excellent tenor
of the Cisneros company, provides a spirited render-
ing of what a Sydney daily paper scribe wrote of as
“a remarkable song by the New York organist, Bruno
Huh-n, and entitled ‘lnvictus,’ ” which is really W.
E. Henley’s well-known “I Am the Captain of My
Soul” verses done into music. Having read in the
same paper that the lines had been given “a flaming
musical setting that form a stirring and impassioned
utterance—as of one storming the very gates of
Heaven,” I was t not prepared for a trivial ditty.
The “stirring” elements are provided by Henley’s
words and Default's declamatory vocalism, not by
the Yankee organ-grinder, who has, to my way of
hearing, treated the dead poet most despitefully.
The opening lines:—
“Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from Pole to Pole,”
have been set to a few jaunty bars, which suggest
a breezy nautical hero in comic opera, and at no
time is the music worthy of the words; in fact,
Iluhn seems to get nearest to the spirit of the thing
with a couple of preliminary piano notes. It beats
me, by the way, why a composer of the right sort
has not got on to Henley before now. His “Life and
Fate,” “Ballade of Dead Actors,” and “Midsummer
Days and Nights” are full of possibilities.
Dion Boucicault made one of his now rare stage
appearances last month in London, to play his old
Australian part of the Frenchman, in a revival of
Pinero’s “Amazons.” The three girls were Phyllis
Neilson-Terry, Pauline Chase and Marie Lohr (played
here by Mrs. Brough, Grace Noble and Brenda Gib-
son). The only member of the original cast now on
deck is Weedon Grossmitli, as the neurotic Tween-
way es. (The three youths in Australia were Tither-
adge, Boucicault and Cecil Ward.)
“Dux”: Are colored minstrels all wallowers in
the abyss of sin and the bog-hole of iniquity? I
ask because a recent Maoriland War Cry held forth
in this wise: “Testimonies were delivered by a con-
verted drunkard, a converted nigger minstrel and
a converted gambler.” By the way, a member of the
Ethiopian musical profession spoke to me once with
a howl of indignation: “I tell you, sah, we are negro
minstrels! To call us ‘nigger minstrels’ is an in-
sult, sah! ”
“Scribe”: Maoriland newspapers resolve not to
have deadhead critics any longer. When the Mel-
bourne Argus was at the tree-top among the highest
monkeys of literature, it insisted on paying for the
dramatic critics. There was a dress-circle ticket
bought for the season for each theatre. Managers
might let in other deadheads if they liked, but the
critic paid for his indubitable right to scoff. Now-
adays journalists sometimes pay their way to the pit
and see the canvasser luxuriating as a deadhead, with
his family, in the dress-circle.
George Gordon McCrae, of Hawthorn (Vic.), has
been reminiscensing in Melbourne Argus. He arrived
in Port Phillip in 1841, being then aged eight. Many
years ago he wrote his recollections, and put them
in a drawer. McCrae was Gordon’s most intimate
friend ; but his best yams go farther back. He tells
a good story of an early theatrical sensation. The
heroine —who was the wife or widow of a knight—-
was one night suddenly carried off the stage by two
strangers, who entered from different ends. The
audience rose and rushed outside, where it saw the
lady lifted into a dogcart, which vanished into the
darkness. There was a tremendous sensation for a
day or two, and then the secret was allowed to leak
out. The abduction was a joke, designed to popular-
ise the theatre, and the lady was in the know. It
doesn’t seem to have struck anybody how very popu-
lar the Quinlan Co. would have become if two beetle-
browed villains had jocosely embezzled Carmen.
Apropos of “Everywoman,” a writer in London
Daily Chronicle discourses on the old-time morality
or mystery play, which used to go strongly in the
English cathedral cities. Some of the old accounts
in connection with the performance of the Chester
morality plays have curious entries: “Payd for mend-
ing hell-mouth, 4d.” ; “for making a new dragon, 5
shillings” ; “for six naked boys to beate the dragon,
six shillings” ; “for settvng the world on fyre, 5
shillings.” Naked boys at a bob a piece were cheap.
Nowadays, partially nude girls often get £2O to £5O
a week.

WANTED, A LOVER!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Edward Dyson has written a play, for which the
Repertory Theatre management require a particularly
impetuous stage-lover. Gregan McMahon says it is
easy enough to get girls to make love on the stage,
but that men stage-lovers are an entirely different
proposition.—B. 27/6/’l2.
Wanted, a lover!
Hard to discover!
Gregan and Dyson,
A r6le for a nice ’un
Have got—they remind one,
But (hang it!) can’t find one—
A dashing, impetuous lover!
Wanted, a wooer!
No bill-er or coo-er,
But ardent and daring, . ,
His passion declaring.
The moment he enters,
The interest centres
In him —the tempestuous wooer!
What a sad story !
Who’d run Repertory?
Poor Gregan is fretting—
I’m also regretting.
Would I were slimmer!
Just to send him a
Wire: “What price me for the lover?”

“Shellback” : Anent the recent dropping of
a huge shell from a sling to the floor of the
magazine of a British man-o’-war, “F. 8.”
(B. 11/7/’l2) thinks it absurd to get excited
when a little accident like that takes place,
because the danger is nil. May be ; but it’s
bad for the nerves, all the same. Weather-
beaten skippers, who carry cargoes of gelig-
nite, cordite, dynamite, bustite, explosite,
sky-high-ite, and such-like, generally reach
their destination with badly-frayed nerves
and visible signs of want of sleep. _ Six
hundred to 1000 tons of sudden death in the
lower hold is nothing out of the way, and
there are few mariners who, in such cases,
can keep their minds off the chances: of a
fire in the bunkers, or spontaneous combus-
tion below hatches'. I know of one instance
where a case of “powder,” as it is still called
in genei'al terms, was short-delivered at one
port, and afterwards found low down among
a consignment for the next port. It was
stowed in a stack of strange goods and had
the bumped appearance that comes after a
fall. The wharfies concerned were evidently
so rattled that they thanked their stars the
thing hadn’t gone whooping up to Heaven,
and left it where it fell. Two years ago
I met the skipper of a British tramp in
Sydney, just recovering from a moral or
stomach collapse. At the Adelaide Powder
Anchorage his craft had safely lifted out a
consignment of explosives for Broken Hill,
and had taken aboard from the hulks about
600 tons for subsequent ports. All being
ready, the skipper had gone on deck for the
pilot, when he spotted smoke emerging from
the hatch where the explosives were stowed.
Luckily, the float came alongside and
stopped any fireworks, and the skipper
thought he was all right—till a couple of
days later, when his nerves commenced to
give way. and lie saw visions, and heard
voices, and began to have unaccountable
jumps, which sometimes carried him Bft.
After that the Adelaide authorities moved
the powder anchorage a mile nearer sea —-
nerves again, I suppose! I firmly believe
that St. John, who dreamed the Book of
Revelation, was an old Mediterranean skip-
per, whose nerves had broken up through
carrying dynamite from Tyre to Massilia.
Kismet! The cook at the Royal Oak
Hotel in Adelaide was at her ordinary hash
the other day when the floor gave way, and
she fell 40ft. Her injuries were fatal —
13yds. and a fraction represent a long fall
and an heroic thud. The hotel is in Hindley-
street, the oldest part of the city, which at
one time relied on wells for its water supply.
This particular well had been boarded over,
and built on' and forgotten. Time and Fate
and the lady’s 14st. of the rest.
The story of a recent revel
It happened in Melbourne after a prize-fight and
a heavy supper. The gilded youths were motoring back
to Toorak, their very molars awash, as Milton or George
Reid or one of those old poets hath it, when they
discovered a small pony dead by the roadside. In a
spasm of vinous wit they
harnessed themselves to
the deceased, and drew
it into the sacred pre-
cin c t s of Guv’ment
House. They then towed
the creature into the
bungalow, built to ac-
commodate a plethora
of suite, and put it in
an aide’s room. The
aide was much dis-
tressed when he fell
over the corpse
half an hour later.
However, he had it
back upon the royster-
ers the next day. He
found the owner of
the pony, and the lat-
ter asseverated with
forceful language that
the animal had been
mer el y stunned, or
asleep, when it was
found, and must have
d’ed through the brutal
ill-treatment accorded
it. The humorists
have had to part up
a tenner, recompense
the gardeners for the
damage, and buy new
evening clothes all
round. And next time
they find a horse that
has fainted they will
just let that horse
faint.
The Congress of Associated Chambers of
Commerce of Australasia, which recently
sat in Melbourne, was as long-winded as its
name. Mostly it considered questions of
great national importance, such as the sign-
ing of dockets, and the immoral construction
of bills of lading, but in two little matters it
delved deep. One was to the effect that the
Australian Government be asked to negotiate
with Britain and Canada in order to acquire
a State-owned cable across the Atlantic (this
was pure Socialism, but the Congress cheer-
fully disremembered that fact). The other
was that, in the best interests of the hinter-
lands of valuable but disused ports, the Aus-
tralian Government be urged to compile
accurate import and export returns of such
ports. Doubtless the compilation of accurate
returns would stimulate the trade of places
like Portland (Vic.) and Eden (N.S.W.)
HIS CHOICE.

something memorable. Yet there are pecu-
liar peopie who sutler from an idea that the
building of railways from these places
directly inland would do more to develop
them than all the returns ever compiled. But
that is a matter for the States, not the Com-
monwealth ; and Chambers of Commerce
would not annoy the ridiculous State Gov-
ernments for all the trade in a bucketful of
minor ports.
* * * *
“Keyhole” gives his view of the wireless
tangle
The Australian Governnfent has for its wireless
expert Mr. G. G. Balsillie,. a gentleman who is said
to have devised a system of radio-telegraphy materi-
ally different from-, and. superior to, any . other at
present on the market. The Australian Government
adopted his system, and fitted his apparatus in the
Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart stations, declared it
a national secret, and refused to allow any strangers
to view the apparatus. The Marconi company said it
was anxious to inspect the new and improved outfit,
just to make sure that' none of its patents had been
infringed ; but it was resolutely dogged off the pre-
mises, or, rather, not allowed to get near them.
So it went to the Court and asked for an
injunction. It prayed that the Court would
order the Government to allow an inspection.
The Government replied that to do so would
be prejudicial to the public interest; and
Justice higgins refused to make any order. Marconi’s
people then appealed to the Full Court, consisting of
Grirtith, Isaacs and Barton. Nothing appears to
give the Chief Justice greater delight than upsetting
the Commonwealth applecart, and he scoffed at the
refusal of tlie Government to allow an inspection.
The case assumed a political aspect, in which the
Chief was clearly against the Government, with
Isaacs leaning, at an angle of 45 degrees in the
opposite direction, and Barton lying low on the
weather bow, undecided into which scale to drop his
judicial avoirdupois. At this stage counsel for the
Government applied for and obtained an adjourn-
ment until the following day, and used the
respite to file an affidavit, alleging that the
proposed . inspection would seriously prejudice
the naval and military defence of Aus-
tralia. Even the Chief Justice staggered away from
the responsibility of making an order in the face of
that declaration, and as a way out of a difficult
and hostile situation, the matter was adjourned for
three months, to enable Mr. Balsillie to take out
patents for his inventions. Apparently the Court
imagined that the specifications would be available
to all and sundry, including Thomas, Richard and
Henry; but that doesn’t necessarily follow. Under
the Patents Act, the Minister has power to order
them to be sealed up and preserved as a close secret.
* * * *
“Rimu” : One of the latest Socialistic doc-
trines to be preached in Sydney is the
nationalisation of the Jew. The theory ap-
pears to be that as everyone has a right to
his share of air, sunshine and land, so he is
entitled to his proper fraction of the pedi-
gree of Abraham. To make the Chosen
Person, with all his alleged cash-collecting
proclivities, a State asset, from which the
general public may draw dividends, is re-
garded by those who subscribe to the new
creed as even more important than land re-
form. The Jew is supposed to be able to
make wars or end them. Under the new
system he would simply be harnessed like
Niagara to more’useful work, and his enor-
mous power would no longer go to waste.
Just how all this is to be brought about is
not very clear. King John tried it in the
Cold Country several centuries ago, per
medium of a pair of pincers applied to the
teeth of Israel; but the Jew got back on the
alleged Christian every time. And possibly
he is still getting back, if the number of
Hebrew dentists in Australia is anything to
go by. [lncidentally, does anybody know a
really rich Jew? Jews in fairly good cir-
cumstances are common enough, but if the
lonesome exception of the Rothschildren is
left out, where is the rich Jew? (Signed)
Israel Macßulletin.]

HIS PIOUS HOPE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I hope that the Government will proceed ex-
peditiously with the building of the capital, and I
look forward to the possibility that perhaps the
next Parliament may meet in the Australian Federal
Capital at Yass-Canberra.
—Senator Gardiner (N.S.W.).
Mean winter temperature of Melbourne, 48.5° ;
mean winter temperature of Yass-Canberra, 41°.
—Gold Fact.
The Senator sat in his easy seat —
’Twas lined with a warm, red leather —-
Large radiators afforded heat,
He hadn’t a sign of frozen feet,
Although it was freezing weather!
Aloft in the gallery glum men sat,
Huddled up close together!
They gazed on the Senator down below —
His bald head shone in the genial glow,
As he rose and started to blether!
The Senator sprang from his padded seat
And waved his hand like a feather!
ITe cursed in a voice that was half a bleat
(The glum men shuffled their mud-cold feet)
Till he came to the end of his tether !
The glum men gazed at the carpet thrice,
And nine times yawned to the ceiling!
Outside the southerly cut the ice,
And whisky hot was a drink of price,
And their feet had lost all feeling!
But still, in a dream, or it may be worse,
They heard that Senator blether —
As a lame man follows a laden hearse,
Their tired minds followed the futile Curse
Of the man on the warm, red leather!
And what was the Curse? And what did he say?
Oh. . .not very much, I confess!
He only expressed with a beaming eye
The pious hope that, by next July,
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Honorable Members and
Senators, the entire Parliamentary staff, Han-
sard, the police, the Commonwealth Cat, and
the reporters
Would have been torn from their present compara-
tively comfortable quarters to freeze to death in
a tin Parliament House in the Howling Wilder-
ness !

50 men recently chosen as likely, only 17
passed. It was actually found that a con-
vict had been sworn in. Maximum age
used to be 27, but now men as old as 30
may join. Formerly, when recruits were
plentiful, men who wanted to resign were
facilitated. There was the same feeling as
in the U.S. fleet: “Let deserters go. We
don’t want ’em.” Now, however, three
months notice is required in the Victorian
police. Men with a little experience crave
to get over into the N.S.W., South Austra-
lian or Westralian police. _ Even on a basis of
20 years service, Victoria is Is. 7d. a day
behind N.S.W., Is. Bd. behind South Aus-
tralia, and Is. 10(L behifid Westralia. Only
in Victoria has a constable to provide his
own uniform. A new order has been re-
cently issued urging constables to induce
suitably men to join the force. How differ-
ent from a few years ago. A call for SOO
men brought 19,000 applicants. This _ was
indeed regarded as a disastrous national
sign ‘ *
The more or less recent history of a block
of land in Newport (Vic.) is a fine sample of
“business enterprise.” It comprises 11 acres,
and was valued at the height of the land
boom, away back in the years that James
Munro and Bent and the locust have eaten,
at £l2OO per acre (£13,200). When the
first signs of collapse were visible, the owner
hastily sold for £lO,OOO, of which £4OOO was
paid in cash by the purchasers, and the rest
was raised on mortgage. Before the buyers
could pass on the 11 acres of white elephant,
the bubble burst, and their £4OOO went where
last summer’s hot winds and girly hats have
gone. The mortgagees —the usual “bank” —
had it on hand till they were sick of the
very thought of it. They offered it at £3OOO,
then £2000; till the other day a local resi-
dent bought it for £lOOO. He sub-divided,
and sold it at prices that cleared him £4OOO
on his deal —400 per cent, profit. Thus does
Private Enterprise gain great wealth or lose
it, as the case may be; but all these transac-
tions have not benefited the country by one
penny piece. Meanwhile, nearly all the
parties interested are strongly opposed to the
Tote, and look upon horse-racing and two-up
as almost as bad as murder, and seven
degrees worse than sacrilege or arson.
AN ERROR OF
JUDGMENT.
SHE : “I think
you've made a
mistake. ”
HE (seeing her face for the first time): “I'm
sure I have."
King Georgy is turning his middle-age to
diplomatic usefe by going down coal mines
and getting into touch with rough workers
on the job. Monarchy must be humanised
if it is to maintain any show of popularity
these times, and a king needs to be young
enough to play with a pick in the bowels of
the earth. George seems to have scored a
point for the established Constitution at a
period of “prevailing unrest,” by touring
around the mining districts of England just
when the spectacle of a king dragging out
coal, or loading heavy goods on a ship, or
driving a cab, or digging up potatoes, or kill-
ing a sheep and selling mutton at a moder-
ate figure was much needec! to give the royal
family that upward leg which helps towards
the skies.
Last week a couple of Sydney
policemen were convicted of ac-
cepting bribes from shop or foot-
path touts, and were fired out of
the force. One of them owned that
he had made £l2 a week, for some
time, by the simple process of plac-
ing the Law’s telescope to his blind
eye when touts were busy. Which
goes to show the lucrativeness of
the touting business. The disclo-
sure renders it more urgent than
ever that the frowsy individual with
the flat feet and the shifty eye, who
mostly lurks outside the cheaper
clothiery and haberdashery estab-
lishments, should be relentlessly
put down. His existence repre-
sents a gross injustice to the law-
abiding firms winch employ
touts. At present he is going as
strong as ever. The writer ob-
served half a dozen of him in full
work in George-street the very
morning the downfall of the bribe-
taking John Hops was announced
in the daily press. One reason why
the street tout is able to defy the
law, with such cynical impudence,
lies, of course, in the fact that the
police force is so small that the
danger of detection is practicallv
nil , graft or no graft. The only
real remedy for that state of af-
fairs is more police. Meanwhile,
it would help things if someone in
authority laid it down that the mere
fact of a predatory-looking vaga-
bond taking up his stand outside a
shop, with the apparent intention
of accosting strangers, amounted to
an offence; just as the lady of obviously
easy virtue is liable to be run in for. merely
pervading the pavement and looking as
though she was willing to fall.

“N. or M.”: Collins-street, Hobart, which
until a few months ago was regarded care-
lessly as a permanent back street, has
“come” suddenly, with the prospect of a
new railway station at the end of it. It is
Hobart’s oldest thoroughfare, born with
Collins’s original settlement, though the pre-
sent roadway deviates somewhat from the
original route. The old All Nations’ Hotel,
which recently passed under the hammer
and was bought in at £24,700, is one of
the street’s most elderly and traditional
buildings. It was the colony’s G.P.O. in
the ’4o’s, and probably as far back as ’34,
though things at that distance are only seen
through a haze of rum fumes. Tasmania’s
earliest road measurements were certainly
made from the All Nations’ corner, although
later, when the post office was shifted, it
was decided not to follow the perioatetic let-
ter-box, but to take Wellington Bridge as a
permanent starting point.
The case of Mrs. Hop Poon Gooey, of Gee-
long (Vic.), is getting beyond a joke. Tory
“journalism” has turned it into a text for a
sermon on the iniquity of the White Aus-
tralia policy as upheld by a Labor Minister,
and the poor little Chow woman is now a
stock subject for the Stinking Fish party.
“Let there be no mistake about it —our fame
as a civilised people is involved in this affair.
The only alternative offered is that if her
husband himself undertakes to leave the
country within six months, she may wait
until then and accompany him. This shows
an official callousness which is not pleasant
to contemplate,” says the Argus. Yet the
NOTH INC, NEW.
THE OLD MAN (after having had the “wire-
less” explained): “That's miffing. Why,
when I was a boy we used to breed carrier
pigeons. ”
fact remains that the bedrock principle of
the Immigration Restriction Act demands
the departure from this country of Hop Boon
Gooey’s artfully exploited wife. The China-
man brought her here from Hong Kong on
the distinct understanding that he would not
be able to keep her here in defiance of the
Act. He was granted an extension of his
honeymoon license on the ground that she.
was about to add to the Chinese population
of Australia, which extension was renewed
for one weak reason or other until the Gov-
ernment was fairly chargeable with bending
the law to suit 11. P. Gooey, Esq. The offer
to let him fool the law for another six
months, if he will undertake to remove him-
self and family from Australia at the end of
that time, is more generous treatment than
the wily tactician has deserved. As for the
Argus suggestion that Minister Thomas
would have the sympathy and support of “an
overwhelming majority in Parliament,” if
he gave Hop Gooey permission to keep his
wife in Australia for ever, it is equivalent to
saying that Labor members are prepared to
sacrifice a big political principle- to please a
tiresome little Chow, which they certainly
are not.

Waterloo doesn’t own as many osprey
plumes as some parts of Sydney, but it has
a public spirit that waves higher than most.
Starting out with the creed that Australia is
worth defending, because it is worth having,
Waterloo proceeded to whoop up the Defence
movement by providing itself with a drill
hall and gymnasium. It gets part of its living
by making bricks, glass and other building
material, and the bosses of these industries
came along with handsome gifts towards the
projected premises. So far, it has over
£l5O in money or goods in hand, and if it
can get a further £lOO from the public, it
reckons that it won’t have to worry the
Commonwealth Government for more than
£lOO to finish the whole thing, including the
supply of gymnasium fittings. Waterloo
lays a good deal of stress on the gymnasium:
for one thing, it has an idea that a gym-
nasium will popularise the cadet business,
and, for another, it is dead-sure that a gym-
nasium will produce a more vigorous citizen
to hold up Australia’s end of the argument.
Perhaps it is in accordance with the
eternal fitness of things that United States
millionaires are not left to sleep restfully in
their graves. The fear of being “shaken”
and held to ransom haunts them even in
their marble mausoleums. John Jacob
Astor, says the cable, is just now in danger
of getting snatched, and a bodyguard is in
attendance outside his dwelling-place night
and day. For this he was dragged from the
sea, where he might have been very well left
to provide food for fish. As it is, the multi-
millionaire merely provides food for reflec-
tion.
“The Religious Editor” : This is
the age of leagues, and associations,
and unions; also of uniforms and
badges. The old suburbanite puts
on a tinted coat when he is about
to roll large weighted globules
along the sward, and the young don
insinuates himself into a striped
jersey ere tigerishly leaping on a
bag of wind and kicking it round a
muddy field. The man, woman or
child who belongs to nothing but
the human family, and habitually
wears nothing but plain duds is
practically extinct. If you search
thoroughly, you will find the appar-
ently unassociated person wearing
a badge on watch chain or bangle,
or concealing a member’s ticket in
pocket-book or peggy bag. And
besides all the societies with ar-
ticles of association, head offices,
hon. secretaries and official organs,
there are what may be termed acci-
dental brotherhoods and sister-
hoods —legions which never were
listed, such as the Brown Bag
League, the Grand and Enlight-
ened Order of Suburban Slug Hun-
ters, and the Brotherhood of Lawn
Barbers. Now, I claim to have
discovered a totally new order:
“The Sisterhood of Reduced
Women Who Have Seen a Lot of
Trouble.” For the benefit of scien-
tists who may wish to inquire fur-
ther. I may mentioii that the out-
ward sign of the order is the round
straw kettledrum hat which (so I
am informed) was very fashionable
some years ago. It balances a
few inches above the thin, drooping
face of the wearer, and looks as if
it might contain the relics of hap-
pier days—marriage lines, old
photographs, dead roses, old mining
scrip, etc. Some night I will
Lnr off and abscond with one of these hol-
low hats and hit it with a sharp axe in some'
lonely spot. And the odds are it will be as;
emnty as the unfurnished sky.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Parson Worrall, of Melbourne, supported a motion
promising the Tories of Ulster the moral and material
assistance of Orangemen in Australia, if it should
be decided to raise Hades in and about Belfast, in
defiance of the law that gives Home Rule to Ireland.
Said Worrall: “It is not possible that the Lord will
foifeake us uowd’
Oh, Johnnie get your little gun,
And, Tommy, beat the martial drum!
There’s going to be a lot of fun,
And blood in Derry streets will run
If Home Rule should to Ireland come.
Dear Brother Snowball, gnash your teeth,
And Parson Worrall, draw your sword
To find for it a fitting sheath
In Irish hearts, and strew the heath
With dead from Mayo unto Meath.
The Lord approveth. Praise the Lord !
Home Rule,' as every good man knows,
Means ceding Ireland to the Pope;
But let’s prepare for lusty blows,
Quick death for all Hibernian foes ;
For traitor Asquith soap the rope.
The fires will blaze, the widows groan,
From Donegal to Waterford,
And, loyal to the Crown and Throne,
We’ll hew the Papists to the bone,
And see the law to Sheol blown.
The Lord will bless us. Bless the Lord!
True law and order cannot be
In Erin under Erin’s laws,
And Law-and-Order’s saints 1 are we,
So load and shoot with holy glee ,
In name of peace and Heaven’s cause.
If Irish rule in Ireland there
Will life be saved and sin abhorred?
No, no, my brothers! In the air
The flames must leap, and we must dare
To wield the sword, and not to spare.
The Lord is with us. Praise the Lord !
VICTORIA.

It would be a farcical state of arfWs
indeed if Ministers could not be ap-

“member for the district.” Vet that
was the view of the position taken by t
Senator Pearce, the Minister for Defence,
when, in granting a request for an in-
terview, made by the Victorian Cham-
ber of Manufactures, he “presumed that
the member for Melbourne (Dr Mal-

“A^allarapooni”: I want to corroborate,
and, at the same time slightly Correct “Fezz” (B.
20/6/T2), in his remarks about our northern croco-
dile. He confounds the fact that there are two
distinct brands of saurian in Australian waters; (1)
the big salt-water, or esturine crocodile, which keeps
within taste of the sea, and which is a man-eater, a
scavenger, and a bad lot generally; and (2), the
little “fresh-water” croc., which never goes below
the limit of brackish water, inhabiting, rather, the
upper reaches of the rivers, a mere fish-eater, and
harmless to man or other beast. Where the big
esturine crocodile may extend up to 18ft. in length,
the little freshwater cove won’t touch the 7ft. mark.
Except that both species belong to the big crocodile
family—-Australia hasn’t an alligator on its pre-
mises—-the relationship between the devils stops dead.
In hardly a single characteristic do they resemble
one another. In fact, it is owing to this non-resemb-
lance that the. incorrect supposition has arisen that
the big salt-water fellow is an alligator. He isn’t.
In respect to the fresh-water croc., there is a point
about him worth recording. Though essentially a
fish-eater, he is extremely partial to flying-fox. The
home of these winged obscenities is amid the dread-
ful mangrove mudflats that fringe the tropic seas—
along the foreshores of the Gulf, and in the deltas of
some northern rivers. Each season when the bloodwood

comes in bloom the flying-foxes make their journey
inland from the coast, and the migrations of these
bats is a sight worth seeing. They follow up the
courses of the rivers in endless streams. Not a
branch, not a tributary, not the merest creek or
gully, where a flowering eucalyptus tree might be,
is left unattended or unexplored. They fly by night,
and their legions pervade the land. The obscene
chattering of the beasts, as they squabble over the
honey that is in the blooms, fills the night with
hideousness and a man’s heart with rage. It is
no uncommon thing to see the bat legions commence
their flight at sundown, fly by thousands past a given
point for every hour of a moonlit summer’s night,
and still be found flying in the dawn ; journeying
south to where (say) 40,000 square miles of blood-
wood forest is in bloom. It is upon these creatures
that the saurians prey. The bats must drink. Some
alight upon the water. like birds, and lap it; others
crawl clumsily down to the water’s edge to drink,
using their foul, ungainly wings as legs. Theft it is
that the crocodile gets in his staunchest work. Where
flying-foxes are concerned he is a gourmand, waiting
neither on ceremony nor on the order of precedence,
but just bogging-in. Remarkable enough to relate,
the crocodile never touches feathered game. Per-
haps it is that the feathers get in his hollow tooth.
“Te Babarantiko” : If “F.A.T.,” who com-
plained in B. 20/6/’l2 about the erratic movements
of the tides Thursday Islandwards, had proceeded
north to the islands and reefs along Papua and the
adjacent coasts he would have had increased reason
to tear up his Mariner’s Guide. The gymnastics of
Neptune are observable right along the Equatorial
islands, large and small. On an absolutely dead-calm
night between Pulo Brasso and North Sumatra, there

will suddenly arise a great noise from a foaming sea
running in regular lines, with small, toppling creaks.
For a few minutes, perhaps half an hour, the water is
all a-boil alongside. Then the disturbance takes up its
bed and walks. The same kind of tide rips are met with
all through the archipelago. Around the Central and
Equatorial Pacific Islands, currents are extremely
strong and erratic, particularly about the points-and
over the submarine spur-like extensions of coral reefs.
Have been anchored on the narrow ledge called
Espiegle Anchorage at Beru Atoll in half a gale of
wind, when the mighty current held the schooner
stem to the breeze, leaving a wake behind as if she
were running before it. I have often seen the cur-
rent run in three sections, say, inner and outer
running north, and the middle running south, in a
belt quarter-mile wide, and have taken advantage
of the freak in the handling of boats. In, guano-
loading days a sailing ship has been known to take
eleven weeks fetching back to moorings at Baker
Island —all through Yankee show-off in declining
the mooring-crew’s assistance. The cause of it? The
cussedness of the winds, causing currents, which
clash with lunar tides, and the formation of coasts
of obstructing island.
“Tamumu”: The gumfields of Maoriland
are a refuge for the destitute, the born-tired, and the
flotsam and jetsam of both sexes. I do not mean
to imply that there are no real toilers among the
excavators of petrified kauri resin, but the con-
ditions are such that the bulk of those who pursue
the elusive nugget would not be much good at any-
thing else. Every digger is his own boss. He has
a bag whare, or hut or tent, in the manuka scrub
where he resides, in most cases alone, sometimes with
a female companion or even wife. He has no fixed
hours. He goes to work when he likes and knocks
off when he pleases. If he doesn’t feel like graft—
well, he doesn’t graft. Firewood, in the form of
manuka, grows all around him. Clothes! —any old
rags. He has plenty of time to read, and mostly
that is what he does with it. The only thing that
compels him to toil occasionally is the necessity to
accumulate enough gum to pay the storekeeper’s bill,
with something over for the periodical spree. When
“suffering a recovery,” he is not worried by the fear
that he may lose his billet. His job is there, waiting
patiently, until such time as he feels fit to tackle
it. Above all, there is the sporting aspect. The
digger may toil all day, and gain only four or five
shillings, or he may strike a patch and earn as many
pounds sterling in half the time. Patches are few
and far between nowadays, but they still exist. A
year or two of this life unfits a man for the com-
mon or garden way of procuring a crust; in fact, he
looks upon it with the open contempt of a right-
minded person.
“E.S.S.”: “Orient” (B. 20/6/T2) says:
“The Shanghai lunch proceeded with cooked birds’
nests. . . .The amount of agony gone through by
whites in China over this dish is incalculable. The
Bendigonian sighed and dug chop-sticks into the
thick, tapioca kind of soup made of sticks, feathers,
clay and goodness knows what.” From which it is
clear that “Orient” has been drawing on his imag-
ination. The high-priced Chow dainty is not the
disgusting stew of twigs and feathers that many
people who have not seen it suppose, it closely
resembles chicken soup, and is very palatable. The
edible nest, which is the property of a swallow-like
bird known as the salangane, is made of a
species of alga, gathered by the bird, and is a very
delicate, semi-transparent, gelatinous substance. The
nests are .built in caverns, and under steep cliffs
along the coast, generally in the most inaccessible
places, in the islands about Siam and the Malay
Archipelago. They are found in rows and bunches
packed one against the other. Harvest time lasts
from April to September, each pair of birds con-
tributing three nests during that period. Usually
three months are occupied in the construction of the
first nest, which is stolen before the birds begin to
lay. The}' at once start building a second, which
they complete in a month. This also is prigged
before any eggs are deposited. The patient, swindled
little victims set to work on a third, working over-
time and with a considerable increase of energy.
This time they are permitted to raise their young,
after which that nest too is appropriated by the
watchful collector. In 1909, 18,0001 b. of the nests
were gathered, valued at over 100,000 dollars. The
price depends on their whiteness and fineness, the
best selling at about two guineas per pound. The
nests are washed in cold water, then cooked for
several hours in a closed vessel. They are often
put into a pot with a fat duck. In Stanley’s
“Birds” (1880), it is stated that “About 25001 b. of
these nests are collected every year in the island of
Java, which amounts to about £5OOO a year.” Many
items concerning Java have appeared in The Bul-
letin, but I have not noticed any mention of this
interesting industry.

“Machete”: If “K.N.M.” (B. 20/6/’l2)
is in the vicinity let him attend while I explain
how the stingray shells oysters for lunch. At the
opening of the ray’s gullet there is a crashing ap-
paratus of bone plates and muscle, which would
crack the heart of even a maternity home com-
mittee. Some sharks and numerous other finned
animals are similarly fitted. There is one fish which
has a bradawl on his nose, with which to pry limpets
off the rocks before putting them through the mill.
Coming back to the stingray, it is worth mentioning
that where the beast abounds in Queensland waters
the fishermen always carry a bottle of ammonia for
application to the wound if stabbed by the dagger
of the flapping assassin.
“Tiald”: While we’re on the subject of
tidal peculiarities, I’d like to borrow a corner in
which to remark that at Porirua (M.L.) the tide
frequently is found scooting out in one part of the
bay, and prancing in in another. Hence the name
of the place, which means two streams skurrying in
opposite directions.
SPINIFEX BILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They tell this tale from Doodlekine to Cossack and
Yalgoo—
How Sprinting Sam raced Spinifex along the For-
tesque !
I heard the simple narrative in Perth, from Big
McCrae —
Who held the stakes and clocked the race that broil-
ing Christmas Day !
“Up there, amongst the thorny lands, which horses
hate like h—ll,”
Says he, “Bill chased the pennyweights, and chased
them very well!
Old Martin Walsh and Finnerty—the Warden and his
crew,
TlieV'll* all go bail for Spinifex, who knew a thing or
two.
It’s true,
This tale about the handicap upon the Fortesque!
“As hard as nails was Spinifex—still is, I’m glad to
say—.
When Sprinting Sam from Adelaide came out Pil-
barra way !
Croweater Land had hunted him —this Sprinting
Sam was barred
From all the tracks, in old South Oss, and found the
outlook hard !
So Samuel wandered overland, along the line-o’-
wire ;
Tried Roebourne, Cue and Geraldton—and proved a
burning lyre !
He lied his way successfully, until at Marble Bar—
Full up—-the cursing citizens threw Samuel very
far! —
The jar,
When Samuel struck the wilderness, was quite spec-
tacular.
“Well, after strange vicissitudes, Sam struck this
dusty creek,
As hairy William Spinifex cleaned up for Christmas

From Roebourne thirty miles or more, this western
camp he found,
Where coves like William Spinifex panned out and
specked the ground!
*Maybe there was a score or two—dry-blowers one
and all,
Whose ‘gauge-sixteens’ caught pennyweights in
grains extremely small!
Amongst these guileless citizens, this Sprinting Sam
allowed,
Quite proud,
That he could run like Donaldson, and lick the
blessed crowd !
“Now keep in mind that Spinifex was one whose feet
were bare —
Dry-blowers have a scorn of boots, and never cut their
hair !

Easter Day—
He walked on things like boiler-plates when Sam
arrived that way!

Samuel fled the ’Bar—-
Bill’s boots graced his antipodes ; he felt pecu-li-ar !
So, when this same old Spinifex just murmured low
to me
That he
Would match, against Croweater Land, Sam smiled
with crooked glee!
“ ‘What is the stake ?’ said Sam-u-el. ‘l’m stale;
can’t run for nix’ ;
‘A ’weight per yard,’ said Spinifex ; ‘a hundred yards
we’ll fix!
Provided,’ moaned the Innocent, ‘that I’m allowed
to say
What clothes we’ll wear while running on this
blessed Christmas Day ! ’
Then Sprinting Sam with diffidence allowed at once
that he,
With these plain terms of Spinifex would certainly
agree!
‘The only thing that worries ; me’—here William
spoke with guile
(How vile!)
‘ls that the stakes ain’t large enough to make us
race in style!
“ ‘l’ve got a draft I’m sendin’ East for fifty pounds,’
said Bill;
Tf you’re prepared to cover it, we’ll race to Broken
Hill!’
Then Sprinting Sam despondently allowed that he
was ‘down’ —
He’d motor-cars in Adelaide, owned pubs in Mel-
bourne town !
Last week he’d lost his pocket-book—maybe his
cheque would do,
With several pounds which Sprinting Sam had
spieled at crib and loo?
He had a gold chronometer (he’d prigged it at the
’Bar) —
A ‘star’!
‘Oh, that’ll do,’ said Spinifex. ‘l’m not partic-u-lar!’
“ ‘I vote we run immediately,’ quoth William next,
and then
The camp hoorayed with emphasis—’twas something
after ten !
‘Hold on a bit,’ said Sam-u-el. ‘Maybe a bet or two
Would help to liven Christmas-time along the For-
tesque ! ’
‘ l’ll back myself in pennyweights, in ounces, or in
pounds’—-
Said Bill, ‘against Croweater Land, since I’m to fix
the grounds !
On which to base this argument,’ quoth he. ‘This
sultry noon —
That’s soon !
This champ, we’ve struck from Adelaide must run
without his slioon !’
“ ‘All right,’ said Sprinting Sam-u-el, ‘if your feet,
too, are bare’ ;
Bill said they were. The champion booked wagers
then and there !
At noon the Camp was mobilised, escorting Bill and
Sam.
Beside the sun-baked Fortesque Bill looked a humble
lamb! . , , , •,
‘This hessian-square’s the startin -place, said Bill.
‘l’ve bought it new
For your—ahem ! —con-ven-i-ence. Now, tape the
Step lively, boys! Croweater Land and I’ll take off
our boots —
Time scoots ! ’ —-
Bill smiled on Sprinting Sam-u-el, who loved such
easy Toots! ’
“ ‘Here, Tom,’ with sweet simplicitee, said Bill to
Big McCrae,
‘You hold the stakes. This draft o’ mine perhaps
might blow away !
Collect the champ.’s chronometer, his cheque, and
several pounds—
They’ll help to liven Christmas-time, as Postle here
expounds! ’
So Sprinting Sam deposited his cheque with sinful
pride,
His watch and notes. Croweater Land felt wholly
satisfied.
‘His draft is mine V breathed Sam-u-el, and crouched
him very low.
Oho !
Whilst Bill awaited carelessly the starter’s word to
go.
“The word rang out! Croweater Land leapt twenty
yards or more ;
Then leapt again in fury wild, and cursed and raved
and swore!
‘This ain’t no high-jump Marathon,’ said Spinifex, as
he
Looked back and saw the spieler-cove bound skyward
bitterly.
‘This is a plain flat handicap, in which the best feet
win.’
He cantered home at ease, and wore the while a
cheerful grin.
The sand, you see, was more than hot enough to
roast a ham,
So Sam
Limped dead-broke: from the Fortesque, observing
‘Cuss!’ and ‘D—n.’ ”

For breakfast on a cool morning, for
night's tea, for picnics, for all
-'Jfccasions when a quickly prepared,
appetising dish is required, you'll find
them something special—something
out of the ordinary. Keep a tin or
two in the house for emergencies.
Your grocer sells them.
“Quidam” : When will the poet of the bat-
tery arrive—the poet of the good old reliable machine
that, the world over, is pounding rocks into sand
and turning our solid footholds into slime? It isn’t
what it looks, a dirty, prosaic agglomeration of bits
of iron that merely make , a noise and assist in devas-
tating the landscape and destroying the beauties of
Nature. It is a trusty friend, roaring out its song of en-
ergy and enterprise year in and year out. by day and
by night, come wet and come dry. It is a friend that
has helped Australia through many a hard time when
things were at their blackest, and business was bad
and banks were busted, and nearly everybody was on
the verge of ruin. The old battery can go and
pound itself to death when seasons are good and
every farmer gets a bountiful harvest and the rail-
ways are blocked; but what about the lean times
when the ground is baked and dry, and the trains
carry little but starving stock, and the ships roll
along the coasts with empty holds and water ballast,
and industry is paralysed and the strongest despond-
ent ! What about the importance then of Ballarat
and Bendigo, and Gympie and Charters Towers, and
Broken Hill and llalgoorlie! And what about the
battery as a pioneer! Wherever the indefatigable,
adventurous prospector goes, from Victoria to the
Gulf and from Westralia to the Northern Territory,
the battery goes after to support him, and from a
little five-head scrap, tappity-tapping away on a
secluded creek in Northern Queensland, to the great
12501 b. leviathan that pulverises its thousands of
tons every week, its advent spells life and hope.
And what secrets it tells to the man who knows its
voice! Put an experienced battery-man behind the
stamps and hear the steady, persistent, satisfied roar
that hardly varies from one shift’s end to another.
Then put on a novice, and hear the crashing, smash-
ing uproar when the stamps are on the “bottoms,”
or the jerky, clinking, brolcen-off sound when its
maw is over-fed, keeping the battery-man in a state
of nervous excitement in anticipation of broken
shanks on the one hand or broken gratings on the
other. Not a confused noise this to the ear that is
in sympathy, but all an intelligible language, speak-
ing above all things of industry and mostly of good
wages and good fellowship, and of men acquiring,
wealth without taking it out of the pockets of their
fellow-men ; a language that voices the roaming, ad-
venturous gambling spirit of the mining community
as no other language ever has done. Isn’t there room
for a poet in all this?

“Vectis” encounters a hatter: —
When I reached the little bush township I was
out of cigarettes. Found a shop which was branded
“Music Warehouse.” The window stock consisted
of 10,018 dead blowflies, a jar of boiled sweets, a
vegetable marrow, and some packets of Three Castles.
Inside, the stock consisted of cigarette boxes piled
from floor to ceiling. I knocked on the counter and
THE LADY SPEAR’S.
“Tie a lover's knot, Bill!"
the echo was a husky “Dammit,” followed by “Blarst
them custermers.” Then there was a dead silence.
1 hammered on the counter with a 41b. weight. The
voice again: “Orright, blarst yer!” At length the
owner appeared. He was a little old man with wiry
whiskers and protruding front teeth. He looked like
a worried walrus. He wore a frock-coat and a boat-
shaped cloth cap, and he had a horse-rug round his
shoulders, fastened by a wooden skewer in front.
“I want some cigarettes,” I said.
“Don’t keep ’em!” he snapped, and turned to go.
“Here, hold on! What about all those boxes?”
“Them’s empty. All empty. Yer see, it’s this
way.” He sank his voice confidentially: “They spiles
in this ’ot climit, so we takes thor packits all out.
Them boxes is empty ; ev’ry dashed one of ’em.”
“Well, what the Hades do you do with them when
you have taken ’em out?” said I, exasperated.
“Put ’em in ther winder.”
“Give me one of those in the window, then.”
“Them’s sold!” he yelled.
“Look here,” I bellowed, “this is a bit over sthe
odds. Why do you have that notice in the window
if you haven’t got any cigarettes?”
“Wot notus? Oh, that? Well. I’ll tell yer.” He
became intensely mysterious, and leaned across the
counter: “It drors trade, d’yer see? It drors trade'”
I left.
GENEROUS.
GENEROUS YOUTH : " Hi, Mister , d’yer want
a dory?”
“Snell”: Saw it proclaimed by a person
of splendid public spirit in Victoria the other day
that experienced Aus-
tralian bushmen should
be induced to take im-
migrants for mates, to
instruct them in the
work. I have been
wondering what “in-
ducement” would b e
forthcoming, and sug-
gest a weekly bonus
of £ 5 to the experi-
enced bushman, and
a paid-up life insur-
ance policy for £lOOO.
Without some such in-
ducement, the experi-
enced Australian bush-
man won’t have the
fresh immigrant, partly
for the reasons that
restrain Fat and Go.
from taking Weary
Willie into partnership
in their large and
prosperous city busi-
ness, and partly be-
cause the experienced
bushman objects to
having an inexperi-
enced mug from Fog-
ville - on - Thames
dropping trees on him
when his attention is
otherwise engaged.
The expert who can
shake an axe can earn
good money, but his
game is pretty danger-
ous even when hi s
mate is also an expert.
When the mate is a
chump it is a deadly
calling. This is why
immigrants in their
perfectly raw state are
not wanted in timber
country, and why Mr.
Fat will experience
some difficulty in per-
suading a good bush
worker to mate with
a new' chump who, if
put on a big stick,
couldn’t earn bread
crumbs for a canary.
“Tekelo”: Was recruiting recently near
Waisissi, Malaita, when a canoe containing two men
and a young girl about 15 years old came alongside
the schooner. There was an exchange of conversa-
tion, betel nut and tobacco between its occupants
and our native crew, after which the canoe departed.
When it was safely out of sight one of the boys said,
“That Mary going to die, finish.” On being ques-
tioned, he explained that the girl had “fallen,” and
in her descent had fractured one or two tribal com-
mandments. The other party to the damage had
already been stamped out, and the little woman was
on her way to play lead in a similar tragedy and
provide the joint for the ensuing feast. No fresh
meat goes to waste in Malaita. Yet she gave no in-
dication to us that anything unusual was afoot. This
doesn’t speak well for the Malaita Mission Society,
but then there are so many things that don’t speak
well for the missionary that it is hardly worth while
mentioning one in particular.
“Jacques Kremaine”: In the current issue
of The Lone Hand Francis Birtles makes the error,
common to most, of confounding the sleeping lizard
with the blue-tongued species. The photo, repro-
duced with the magazine article is that of the sleep-
ing or sleepy lizard, whose speed is about one mile
per day, if in a hurry. The blue-tongued lizard is
similar in shape to the gohanna, but smaller. The
largest specimen I have seen was about two feet six
long. The tongue of the sleepy bloque is dark, but
the tongue of the other is a pure indigo color, and
its owner can pass the scenery much faster than a
mile a day. A new-chum Irishman, on seeing the
sleepy or stump-tailed lizard for the first time, ex-
claimed: “Begob, it’s a good job he opened his mouth
or I wouldn’t have known which end was the other.”
Have heard that a lick of the blue-tongue is poison-
ous.
“Wandi”: Boulka Lake and Cobham Lake
look well on the map, dotted right in the north-west
corner of. N.S.W., where permanent water is a greater
desideratum than a gold mine. The place is an
auriferous field, which has borne a good population''
of dry-blowers and fossickers for many decades, and
with a lasting wet lake, ever throwing white caps
to the shimmering haze, Tibooburra and Milparinka
might blossom into fine cities. I hgd heard a lot
of talk of Cobham Lake. To peqple along the
western border of Queensland, hundreds of miles
away, the name was as familiar as Broken Hill.
Naturally, I expected to find something special in
the way of lakes. I was disappointed. The lake
was there, but it had no. water in it. The oldest
inhabitant said it was the first time it had ever been
known to go dry. He said it sorrowfully, bitterly,
seeming to regard it as an old friend who had gone
back on him. He had so long crowed over his fellow-
patriarchs of Dep6t Glen; he had so often said,
“Pooh! look at Cobham!” when the other fossil had
praised his own pond, that he felt disgraced and
humiliated. His dignity was injured; his pride was
wounded, his prestige was ruined; his spirit was
broken. Cobham had fallen from its grand eminence
to a second-rate water-hole. It might rise to greater
magnificence than ever in the next wet season, but it
could never recover its good name. It wasn’t per-
manent. Depot Glen had beaten it; and, henceforth,
for all time, Depot Glen was the boss water-hole.
Worse than that, the ancient resident of that place
wrote to inquire how the fish were biting in his clay-
pan. He wished he had died before such ignominy
had come upon him.
“H. J.E.”: There is comparatively little
danger from lightning when rain is falling; but it
is all there when the sky is thick and hazy, with
about four drops of rain to the acre. Remember
at Broken Hill a dry storm, through which a boy
was riding on a bicycle. Suddenly the machine
was illuminated and ran on for about 20yds. with
the lightning playing round it, the tyres evidently
acting as insulators. When youth and bike toppled
over the lightning bounced along the road, tearing
large holes in places, and finished up by ripping
out a water main which was a couple of feet under
the metal surface. The body of the youth, however,
showed only very slight discoloration, like powder
burns, down the side of face and arm, and the bike
was not damaged to any extent.
“E.S.S.”: Approaching a selector’s house
one day I was met by a small boy who seemed to
be all pants and braces. He was bareheaded, bare-
footed and coatless; but he was proud, and, as he
stood with his hands in his pockets and his chest
thrown out, it was plain that he was bursting to tell
something. He had been watching for a boy chum
of his, it subsequently transpired, and, as the chum
had disappointed him, he made the best of the situa-
tion by seizing on the stranger.
“We’re shearin’,” he volunteered.
“Where’s the shed?” I asked.
He pointed to a sapling yard, with a low, bark-
roofed calf-pen at one end.
“How many shearers?”
“Father and Sarah.”
“Got many sheep ?”
“Thirty-nine.”
He escorted me to the yard, in which shorn sheep
and woollies were boxed together. A tarpaulin was
spread on the ground, with some bagging stretched
overhead for shelter. Here Sarah was busy taking
off the belly wool and cleaning the legs for her father.
The latter was shearing in one of the cow-bails,
which was floored with slabs. Two other bails were
used as bins, the calf-shed as a catching-pen, and
three or four planks, resting on cases, formed the
wool, table. Here another girl was skirting and roll-
ing fleeces. Nearby, hung upon the rails in the
corner of the yard, was an animated bale, into which
she threw the fleece wool, after tying it with .twme.
When father called, “Wool away here,” the anima-
tion of the bale was explained. Out of it climbed
a boy of nine, who had been trampling the fleeces
down. He was picker-up and presser.
About that stage another boy clattered up on
horseback. He transpired to be the son of a neigh-
bor, who was also about to commence shearing, and
had sent across to borrow the shears.
“Well,” said the ringer, “you’ve struck us in the
middle of shearing; but we’ll be finished about to-
morrow night—if you don’t mind waitin’.” The
boy let his horse go, and apprenticed himself to
Sarah.
“Machete”: The Papuan native, like the
European of the Middle Ages, walks through a world
of devils. There are earth, wood and water devils,
pig devils, dog devils, alligator devils, assorted devils,
and especially lady devils. If any respectable Sydney
tourist should happen to be in a native garden and
see a seductive young lady beckoning to him from
the edge of the clearing—well, better not. No reli-
able Papuan bookmaker will lay you odds she is not
a devil. Kipling tells of an Indian belief that the
spirits of women who die in childbirth haunt the
edges of the standing crops in the same way. Their
feet are turned backwards that men may know them.
The consequences of answering the invitation either
in India or Papua are quite too awful to discuss.

“Mimosa”: Recently came on the follow-
ing gem of a notice that had been posted up in a
West Queensland shearing shed by the boss: —
The Rules op Shearing.
(1) Good pay for honest work: This belongs to the
shearer.
(2) The wool without chopping: This belongs to
me.
(3) The hide: This belongs to the sheep.

ciations have suggested such atrocities as Kow
Plains, Hogroot and Toothache! I’m just waiting
for some alleged Australian body to nominate Belly-
ache. It would be a junction, and you would change
there for Stomach-pump.

A KING IN WORKADAY ATTIRE.
It is reported that George V. recently went down a coal mine, in order to “familiarise himself with the conditions of the workers."
The idea was good, but it might have been followed up more strenuously. The above shows the King still further familiarising himself
with the conditions of the workers.

Some; 20 Australians keep company with Edward
VI J . in the new volume of the “Dictionary of Na-
tional Biography.” Tom Bent is one (Bv the
way antiquaries will be interested to learn that
Bent-street, Syc.ney, was so named in honor of the
ather of Tom Bent, late Premier of Victoria, who
had a corner lot there in the early days.”) This is
the Dictionary’s estimate of the Brighton market
gardener. Rough and uncultivated, shrewd and
strong unorthodox end even unprincipled in his
methods, yet always
boldly accepting re-
sponsibility io r his
actions.” Braddon, of
the Blot, was “hardly
popular, his bluff
manner of speech being
too often tinged with
sarcasm.” Graham
Berry was “a self-
in a d e man without
education, a demo-
cratic leader with a
fervent belief in demo-
cratic principles, a
fluent speaker, but no
violent demagogue. Tt
is added that a private
member attacked
Berry, then Treasurer
in the Duffy Govern-
ment, for having ap-
pointed his father-in-
law to a lucrative posi-
tion in the public ser-
vice. The charge was
investigated by a se-
lect committee, which

HARRY COYNE,

“Looking Backward” writes :
There’s no particular objection to the erection of
statues to popular criminals, if there is a popular
demand for their marble perpetuation. But concern-
ing the proposed Dick Turpin statue at Brougu,
Yorkshire (B. 11/7/’l2), the inhabitants seem to be
under a delusion. Dick was not a deserving criminal
at all. He did not profess to belong to the gentle-
man highwayman class. He didn’t scorn to rob the
poor, and he didn’t befriend maidens in distress. In
private life he was a butcher, and simplified his
work by “duffing.” Later, he took to the roads, and
so far from possessing the Anderson co.’s brand of
chivalry, he prtured an old lady by burning her.
Dick was hanged in York for horse-prigging, in 1739.
The ride to York was not his exploit at all, but Nick
Nevison’s. Nevison was a gentleman—a robber of
engaging manners, great stature and vast courage.
The broadsheets published after his lamented death
on the gallows at York tell of his many deeds of
charity. His only murder was the killing of a
butcher who tried to arrest him. This is graphically
described in “The Bloody Newes from York,” a
quarto pamphlet published in London in 1674. Nick
was recognised while pursuing his unlawful calling
within sight of where Dickens afterwards lived at
Gad’s Hill. He -rtfde to York (200 miles), in 15
hours, and at once visited the howling green, to be
seen of the public. Thus he established an alibi,
the feat being regarded as impossible. Cruickshank
has a striking picture of Dick Turpin, on Brown
Bess, clearing a toll gate, which appears to be 7ft.
high, but this is apocryphal.
“Iyles Innison”: Novelist and poet
Harold Begbie, on behalf of the London
Daily Chronicle, recently interviewed
General Booth, of the much-banged drum,
“Are you a pessimist or an optimist in your
S4th year?” the interviewer asked, and this
was the result: —
“Everywhere,” the General replied, “I find the
complaint that the crowd is turning away from the
churches. One of the most striking symptoms of the
age is indifference to religion as religion. Religion
has only too widely become a matter of form in-
stead of a living, breathing, active principle—a
withered husk, a dead shell—and the man in the
street has thrown it away /Am I a pessimist?’
o
it all I am distressed ”
Booth is, so far as I know, the only man
now living who has founded a new and sue-
cessful Christian sect. And in his old age
and physical twilight his verdict is, prac-
tically, that all is dry hash and vanity.

POLOGIST AND AUTHOR.
Presbyterian Parson Crawford, Labor
M.L.A. for Marrickville, has been reading
for the Bar, and expects to be “called”
shortly. The energetic young man is push-
ing on. As a youth he was something very
small in the railways. Then he decided on
the. Church, and took his B.A. at Sydney
Uni. Next he made a good but unsuccess-
ful Federal fight, and dropped out of breath
into a State seat. Now he hopes to be soon
calling Wade his learned friend. Not his
burned friend, nor yet his learned fiend.
These terms would be too suggestive of the
parsonical job which Crawford is just quit-
ting.
News is just cabled of the death in Eng-
land of John Ettershank, the principal man
in an important political case of old Vic-
torian days. A measure had been intro-
duced in the Victorian Parliament called
the Quieting of Titles Bill, the object being
to prevent any further investigation into
a great many matters of dummying, per-
jury, forgery, fraud, land-stealing and sun-
dries. Ettershank, Glass (who afterwards
broke) and Quarterman were accused of
bribing members to get it through. One
politician was expelled, and another cen-
sured. G. P. Smith, the Attorney-General,
did not proceed against Ettershank, Glass
and Quarterman at law, but charged them
with breach of the privilege of Parliament.
They were found guilty, and ordered to be
imprisoned during the will of the House,
which would apparently mean till the end
of the session. They appealed to the Full
Court, composed of Stawell. Barry and E.
Williams. The Judges held that Parlia-
ment acted ultra vires, and liberated the
three. The Attorney-General then appealed
to the Privy Council, which held that the
Judges were wrong, and allowed the appeal,
maintaining that an Australian Parliament
had the same privileges as the House of
Commons. But the pot bad long since
ceased to bubble furiously, so the matter
was allowed to drop.
PATTEN , President of the Farmers and
Settlers' Conference, Sydney.
Prime Minister Fisher, with a humble £1,
was the first depositor in the Commonwealth
Bank. But the dice were loaded, for Fisher,
by virtue of his official position, made things
right with the manager, and got in by an
early door. There was a similar scramble
for the first Commonwealth note, and then,
also, a Minister got in by the early door.
Someone was allowed to assert in The
Bulletin, a while back, that Miss Myrtle
Meggy, the pianist, was born on the Moree
Plains (N.S.W.). This was incorrect. Any-
how, her father has just written to say that
the talented maiden was born in Sydney;
and, as he ought to know, and is as reputable
and veracious a slinger of ink as any in the
business, this paper has no hesitation in
taking his word for it.
A curious old benefactor struck the British
and Foreign Bible Society, Sydney, last
week. He wrote in anger to say that he was<
aged 70, had been 58 years in Australia, and
had at various times (1) fallen downstairs,
(2) fallen into the fire, (3) been nearly
wrecked by a bolting horse, (4) been nearly
murdered, (5) been struck by lightning, (6)
been bitten by a snake, (7) etc. After all
this, he complained bitterly, he hadn’t even
been made a J.P. And in his rage he for-
warded 70s.
Hugh D. McIntosh, of the Stadium, pro-
poses to try his hand at being a Sydney
alderman if the electors are willing. His
programme is good, and includes the earliest
possible creation of Greater Sydney, to take
over common services, acquire the tram-
ways, build the North Shore Bridge, and
construct underground cify railways to re-
lieve the congestion of traffic. Besides
these lie has other ideas too numerous to
mention. And by the time the McIntosh
has bullocked through with his policy his
hair won’t be as black as it is now, and his
bounding energy will be smouldering very
low.
“Oldest Inhabitant”: Now that William
David Beazley has fled across the Jordan
there remain above ground only three Vic-
torian Speakers or ex-Speakers—Mason (I
think he is above ground), Matthew Davies
(I believe he is above ground, for I saw,
the other day, some one who looked more
like him than he ever looked like himself),
and Frank Madden (I am almost sure
Frank Madden isn’t buried). The defunct
Victorian Speakers (unless I have mixed
them up very badly) are Murphy and Duffy
and Berry, MacMahon, Bent, Gillies, Lalor
and Beazley. The longest of these was
Murphy, who reigned for the best part of
15 years. And the broadest was Bent,
whose tales and circumference were equally
wonderful.
The announcement of a forthcoming bronze
statue of deceased caterer Skinner, which edi-
fying effigy is to be erected in Albert Park
(Melb.), ought to revive the question of a
memorial to the late Guilfoyle, creator and
curator of Melbourne’s beautiful Botanical
Gardens. Long before Skinner had started
to purvey sandwiches and patronise “sport,”
the worthy Guilfoyle was at work on the
landscapes which are only now beginning
to get their full meed of admiration. What
the Melbourne of to-day owes to the artistic
taste, botanical knowledge and sustained en-
deavor of Guilfoyle is only a suggestion of
what the city will owe to him 50 years
hence.. The glories of his Garden are still
in their youth, but the formation of its char-
acter is practically completed. And the
man who made it what it is, and what it is
going to be, should have a handsome statue
of himself on its highest ground—a statue
with a fountain in front of the pedes-
tal, so that uninfluential citizens might
stand bareheaded before it on a summer’s
day and drink to the memory of the Botani-
cal Gardener in the water that nourishes
his lawns and rose trees.
“U.S.” : Certain recent Victorian happen-
ings faintly recall or suggest Henry Ward
Beecher, brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe,
the shrieliy lady who evolved “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin” out of her imagination, she having
never lived in the slave States or seen a
nigger flogged in all her life. Mrs. Beecher
Stowe was a stout, handsome, complacent-
looking person who didn’t have a bath fre-
quently. but that is a side issue. Henry
Ward Beecher was, in his day, New'York’s
most sensational preacher. Once he com-
menced a sermon by mopping his forehead
and remarking “It’s damned hot!” Theo-
dore Tilton and his wife were Beecher's
especial friends. Tilton was editor of a big
New' York paper, but lost his job with a
crash. When he started a divorce case, with
Beecher as co-respondent, New York had the
time of its life. Mrs. Tilton confessed, more
or less. After that she retracted. She said
that once, in the dead wmste and middle of
the night, she suddenly realised the full
measure of Tilton’s wickedness in suspecting
Beecher; and, rising up, she denounced him
in her nightdress, and departed. Mrs.
Hooker, Beecher’s sister, believed in Free
Love, and wanted the parson to own up con-
cerning Mrs. Tilton and any other ladies
he could think of, and be proud of it. She
seemed to have an idea that he should own
up whether there was anything to own or
not. Beecher’s letters were produced. They
were numerous, vague, hysterical and non-
committal. In one of them he said that for
months he had been “sitting on the rugged
edge of despair.” It is presumed that he
must have worn out many pairs of pants.
There was really nothing very definite
against Beecher, and the case evaporated.
After that he went on preaching at the old
stand. The end of Tilton was obscure. It
is suspected that he became a police-court
reporter in his old age, or made a precari-
ous ha penny by writing up the state of the
produce market.
“J.H.” supplies a more or less clerical
item: —
Australian religion is represented in the new
volume of the “Dictionary of National Biography,”
by John Alex. Dowie (otherwise Elijah the Second)
among others. The abusive old Profit was born in
Edinburgh. In 1861 he came with his parents to
Adelaide, being aged about 14 at the time. His
first preaching was perpetrated in the Alma Congre-
gational Church, near Adelaide. He next advanced
on Sydnov, starred in a church at Manly, and subse-
quently in one at Newtow-n. Saith the Dictionary :
“He became so prominent as a social reformer, tem-
perance advocate, and
champion of free,
secular and com-
pulsory education, that
Sir Henry Parkes
offered him a seat in
the Cabinet.” (There
is nothing like these
official publications for
supplying irreproach-
ably accurate news.)-
In Melbourne Dowie
started a tabernacle-
that became the scene-
of violent dissensions,,
culminating in the-
committal of John;
Alex, to gaol. On his;
release he steered for
Chicago, where he-
struck oil, blossomed!
out as Elijah the Sec-
ond, wore a long dizzy
robe and a pair of
purple wings, founded!
Zion City, and gath-
ered in some dollars.
He is described as “a
man of fine build,
although obese and
bow-legged, with bril-
liant sparkling eyes
and flowing whit e
beard.” His flowing
blue language is not
mentioned.
CHAS. EVANS ,
Commissioner of Queens-
land Railways.
One day early this month, T. A. Dibbs
strolled into the Commercial Bank of Sydney
and began his 46th year in the general mana-
ger’s chair. And he was 20 years in the office
before he flew to his present perch. He
still joins the 9 o’clock rush, and no other
big bank has so small a gas bill, for he ex-
pects the premises to be cleared by 4.30.
Under his management the best athlete has
always the best billet, other things being
equal. And it seems likely that the same
policy will be pursued by the man who is
cut out to succeed him—ll. H. Massie, the
once famous Australian XI batsman.
Died last week, James R. Thomson, marine
engineer. He was born at Maitland
(N.S.W.), and educated in Glasgow. Among
other things, he invented an especial valve,
which was patented all over the world, and
designed the first compound engines built
in Australia. Of late years he has been
consulting engineer for the Newcastle S.S.
Co., and was professionally responsible for
the rumpus over the Hunter when the Gov-
ernment prosecuted the co. on a charge of
sending the ship to sea in an unseaworthy
condition. It was on Thomson’s profes-
sional reputation that the co. triumphantly-
relied to upset the Government case.
MORE
SOCIALISM.
Mr. D. R. Hall, Minister for Justice, accompanied
by Mrs. Hall, left Sydney on Saturday for Grafton
on a visit to the gaol. He will return along the
coast during the week, and will probably visit the
Tuncurry forests, “where,” he said, “I hope within
the next three or four months to have everything
completed in order to start the first batch of prisoners
tree-planting. The idea of utilising prisoners for
forestation purposes is American in origin, and has
resulted there in excellent effects, both for the.;
prisoners and the country.”
THE MELLOWING OF JOE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The deputy-leader of the Opposition (Mr. Joseph
Cook) mellows as time goes by. —Meloourne Age.
When the Laborites and Liberals are bickering,
Are a-calling and a-bawling in the House,
And the strangers in the gallery are snickering,
As the members rear on end and loudly “rouse,”
There’s a voice they miss amid the vocal thundering,
A voice that led the howl a while ago,
And the people in the precincts are a-woiidering
What has happened to t’.:a erstwhile acid Joe.
For no longer does he lead his noisy following
With a cheering or a sneering to the fray ;
But they watch him sitting silently a-swallowing
All the gibes they hurl at him across the way.
And, as others mark his silence ’mid the bellowing
And the bawling of the blatant party cry,
Then they realise that Joseph is a-mellowing ;
He’s a-mellowing as time goes by.
W hen the Affable’s a-sobbing and a-sorrowing
O'er the “precipices,” “chasms” and the “brinks,”
And the Ministry’s antipathy to borrowing,
Joseph mellows as he sits and sadly thinks.
Sits and mellows ’mid the bellows of his following,
While the howls of Willy Kelly smite his ear.
While the Fusion in confusion is a-wallowing
And the green, unripened members bawl “Hear,
hear ! ”
There is something that is sobering and saddening
In the autumn of political careers ;
And the thoughts of former verdancy are maddening
As a member mellows with the passing years.
For his greenness and his meanness set h'm shivering;
And he solemnly begins to ask himself,
feels the tree political a-quivering:
“Will I ripen on the bough or on the shelf ?”
But the verdancy of Joseph is a-vanishing,
Whereat right-thinking citizens rejoice.
All his sourness and his dourness he is banishing ;
You may note the alteration in his voice.
Though it is not yet attuned to softest ’cello-ing,
’Twill be sweeter, meeker music by-and-bve ;
For ’tis evident that Joseph is a-mellowing,
He's a-mellowing as time goes by.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The loan which Queensland shoved on the
British market the other day proved something very
like a failure. It was for £2,000,000, the interest
was 3$ p.c. and the stock was offered at £96 for
each £lOO worth of nominal security. As the cur-
rency of the loan was 28 years, the subscribers were
thus offered a bonus of rather over 2s. lOd. p.c. per
annum, paid in advance, which raised the interest to
about £3 18s. p.c. To put it another way: Queens-
land proposes to add £BO,OOO of the interest to the
permanent debt, or to pay £BO,OOO of the interest
out of the loan itself. That is what the discount
system amounts to. When a country, whose credit
is only good for a 4 p.c. loan, borrows at 3 p.c., and
issues the loan at £BO, or at 2 p.c., and issues it
at £6O, or at 1 p.c., and issues at £4O, it all repre-
sents, in varying degrees, the sinful habit of paying
part of the interest out of principal. But, to leave
that aspect of the ease, Queensland practically offered
the public £3 18s. p.c. interest. That is much more
than the ordinary figure. At June 30, 1912, the
average rate payable on the whole Queensland debt
was £3 13s. lOd. p.c. ; so the State’s credit is
plainly sinking, like that of its neighbors. Yet, even
at the enhanced interest rate the public didn’t bite
freely. It put up about £200,000. The under-
writers (they get, as a rule, 1 p.c. for guaranteeing
that the loan will be a success, so that reduces the
amount which Queensland receives to £95 per nom-
inal £lOO, and the J. Bull stamp duty and sundries
diminish the net returns still further) had to take
up about £1,800,000 worth of stock. And as the
stock promptly slumped to £94 10s., the under-
writers, who have paid nearly £95, don’t see how
they can unload at a profit on the trusting public,
and are disgusted and angry. They are especially
disgusted because every recent Australian loan has
been more or less of a fiasco.
It is quite plain that the credit of this hard bor-
rowing country has slumped. At June 30, 1911, the
average rates which the States were paying on their
whole debts, including- the ancient 6 and 5 and 4-A
and 4 p.c. loans of the early days, were as follows:
Per Cent. Per Cent.
Queensland . . £3 13 10 Victoria . . £3 10 10
Tasmania . . 3 13 6 N.S.W 3 10 5
S.A. . . 3 13 2 W.A 3 8 4
And the average Was £3 11s. 4d. p.c. Not one of
the States can borrow now at anything like the old
prices. Australia is in this remarkable position:
(1) By shoving up local wages without any corres-
ponding increase of the tariff, and by other follies,
it gave the importer of foreign cheap labor goods such
a start over local industry that imports rose to an
unprecedented figure, and this country was drained
of gold to pay for them. (2) Because of the drain
of gold it became impossible to float loans locally.
Yet certain Governments (especially that of N.S.W.)
had gone mad during the high wage period, and
started the biggest loan boom on record, and having
no idea beyond borrowing and booming they reckoned
they had to keep going. So, the inefficient tariff
having drained Australia of money, they went to
London. (3) London realised that there are some
£36,000,000 of old Australian loans falling due
within the next three years; that this country has
no hope of paying them, except by further borrowing
in London ; and that it will want to borrow another
£30,000,000 or so in the same three years to keep
the boom going. (4) In short, London begins to
think that its customer is mad, and begins to wonder
if he is likely to become insolvent. (5) Also, British
Consols fell last week to £74 15s.—the lowest figure
for nearly a century. They are valued now a good
deal below French securities. Therefore, Bull doesn’t
feel too good about his own affairs, and until they
improve he doesn’t feel inclined to commit himself
too heavily abroad. So, amid all these happenings
and circumstances, the boom which this thriftless
land has been enjoying begins to balance on a razor-
edge, so to speak.

So the profit for the 10 months is almost exactly the
same as for the previous 12 months. That is satis-
factory enough, though the change in the date of
making up the accounts is of doubtful wisdom. The
tendency on the part of most financial and commer-
cial concerns is to shy off the extra labor involved
in balancing during the midsummer holidays, arid it
is a tendency to be encouraged. The undertaking is
financed by loans raised by the Melbourne City Coun-
cil, and carrying from 3 A to 4 p.c. The first loans
were 4 per cents, raised at a small discount. Sub-
sequent money was got at 31. In addition to pro-
viding this interest a sinking fund was part of the
bond, and that circumstance no doubt had a good
deal to do with the low rate of interest at which
Cohen parted. This Sinking Fund is at the rate of 1
p.c. p.a. It is invested apart from the business, as
every sinking fund ought to be, and should enable
the city to say a final good afternoon to the pawn-
broker in from 40 to 45 years, according to the
annual earnings. It would, however, be of little use
if the city merely repaid Cohen and took no measures
to replace plant as it became ready for the scran-
heap. To guard against that there is a Depreciation
Fund, much too small at first, but now increased to
something respectable. The reserves shown in the
first table include the amounts to the credit of these
two funds. Details come next: —
1903. 1910. 1911. 1912.

Total .. .. £33,416 £148,269 £183,616 £225,383
In the first table a small amount is shown as written
off. The total is made up of such items as discount
on loan flotations, removals, and depreciation of
stores. The Depreciation Fund has, therefore, to
stand the racket of all the wear and tear, which is
very heavy in some sections of the equipment. To a
great extent the fund is but a set-off against actual
rust and decay. In other words, if this renewal and
depreciation reserve is merely sufficient to counter-
balance current wear and tear, the undertaking has
no reserves worth mentioning, apart, of course,
from the excellent Sinking Fund. It ought to have
an ordinary reserve fund to guard against contin-
gencies, and it would have one but for the unjusti-
liable grab of profits. In this respect the City Coun-
cil is getting worse and worse. The purpose of the
business was to provide cheap light and power, and
not to relieve property of its rates. No doubt the
Gas. Co. is satisfied. It doesn’t want competition at
rock-bottom prices, and obviously it isn’t getting
that sort of competition.
The total profits shown in the first table are made
up in this way:—
1908. 1910. 1911. 1912.
Balance, working a/c. .£49,599 £55,916 £63,934 £64,004

Profit on sales of plant,
debentures, etc. .. 145 663 689 419
Total profit ..£53,761 £63,842 £70,078 £70,039
The Sinking Fund is invested mainly in Met. Board
of Works and Savings Bank debentures, with other
trifles, including something as far afield as Maoriland
and Fremantle, and this paper has no brick to throw
at the committee on that account. The Depreciation
Fund, being a reserve for the purchase of renewals, is
held liquid, considerably more than half being on
deposit. The practice is as commendable as it is
rare. The Depreciation and Renewals Reserve has,
apparently, not yet been drawn upon; repairs and
maintenance, as well a£ lamp renewals, being charged
up straight to revenue account. This, of course,
makes the position a trifle better than it looks,
assuming that renewals are not being banked up, to
presently burst out in a cataract. The next table
shows some of the details of the business:—

19L2 .. 112,119 48,115 64,004 629,785
The capital outlay is shown above as £029,785.
There have been very few extensions during the year,
the total increase being £l7lB. The amount of bor-
rowed money in the business is £526,000. The
balance has been provided out of revenue. Of the
revenue ( £112,119), private supply was responsible
for £91,022, as against £93,127 for the previous 12
months. This shows a very considerable gain, as
the last term ran to only 10 months. Probably this
was due to a still further reduction in the price per
unit. The maximum charge for lighting has been
cut down another penny, and the minimum (lid.)
a halfpenny during the term; and power per unit,
originally 3d. flat rate, varies from 2d. to fd. In
view of the Hosannahs raised over the reduction in
price made by the Melbourne gas monopoly, the
southern city might spend a profitable 10 minutes
inspecting the half-dozen or so reductions made by
this municipal enterprise during the 16 years of its
life.

June, 1912.. 61,685 12,503 31,837 17,345 305,110
The profits are thus a record. This position has been
reached by the help of the recent tightness on the
money market. This bank has £2,110,083 of deposits,
for which it is paying no interest. Its total liquid
assets, including coin and bullion, amount to
£1,783,531. From this it is clear that over
£300,000 of free money is invested in profit-earn-
ing securities, apart from public stocks, and any
small increase in the rate for overdrafts or other
accommodation is all extra profit. Besides, when
the overdraft rate goes up it usually takes a bigger
jump than the rate of interest on deposits; also, on
fixed deposits the old rate is paid on the bulk of the
money for some time after the rate for new deposits
has been put up. Thus, for a time after the Con-
ditions of prosperity have begun to wilt, a bank
may easily show much better profits than it did pre-
viously. On the other hand, its risks start to grow.
An advance in the rate of interest almost invariably
means a shrinkage in the value of investments. And
if that shrinkage continues a bank is apt to find
that it has lent on a security more than that security
will fetch. Too much importance may, therefore,
easily be attached to the bigger profits which banks
may show just at present. Australia is a country of
pretty violent ups and downs. Lately we have had
one of the ups; the downs will arrive presently
along with bad debts and unproductive accounts.
Many banks are making provision by means of in-
ternal reserves ; but which of them are doing so, and
which are showing all their profits, nobody can tell
from an examination of the accounts.

This comparatively modest figure is partly due to
the dimensions of the capital. After the bubble of
the ’9o’s burst, creditors were invited to take pre-
ference shares, and there is now £416,760 of that
class of capital, while the ordinarv capital amounts
to £1,061,250; total, £1,478,0i0. The deposits
and all other liabilities to the public amount to
£7,427,069. Consequently, for every £l-of share-
holders’ money (capital and reserves), there is £4 3s.
of the public’s money. In Australia, under ordinary
circumstances, £1 to £7 is generally reckoned
quite a safe proportion. On its present' capital the
Victoria could, therefore, take another £5,000,000,
or thereabouts, without having a stone cast at it.
The next comparison shows some considerable

The bank has thus been called upon pretty heavily
by its customers, and that is where trouble so often
starts. It must play the old game of back up or
forfeit. Fortunately, things have taken a turn for
the better, especially in the rural industries; so the
painful business of forfeiting is mostly pushed into
the vague future. This is very good for the Vic-
toria, which is not in a position to do much more
backing up. Its liquid assets represent only 24 p.c.
of its debts to the public, and on paper that is not
enough. Unless the management knows where to go
for a large amount of deposit money, or can call in
large sums that are out, it would not appear to be
safe to make many more advances. In fact, the
tendency should be rather the other way, even ad-
mitting that at the end of June the rural industries
and those that depend upon them usually require
more assistance than they do at the end of the other
half-year.

The Q. N. Bank made its last complete re-arrange-
ment in 1897. It had been in very serious trouble.
In the days when it was hard to tell where the Gov-
ernment of Queensland ended and the Board of the
Q.N.B. started, an effort had been made to prop up
the tottering concern by extensive loans from the
State. That money and most of the millions pro-
vided by the public were represented by monstrously
inflated assets, earning little or nothing at all. It
was consequently arranged that one-fourth of both
the Government money and the old private deposits
should cease to bear interest. The old depositors
also agreed that one-fourth of their principal should
be repayable to them only out of future profits,
shareholders agreeing to draw no dividend until the
whole lot had been refunded. Naturally, therefore,
the shareholder’s eye is glued tightest to the intima-
tions regarding the repayment of this money. For a
long while little progress was made, because the bank
had to make other payments and the earnings were
small. Then, however, just, before the first table
opens, a further slight modification was made, which
entitled the bank to‘devote practically the whole "of
the ,profits to wiping out the debt to the old deposi-
tors. The following table shows the progress made:

£364,159 6s.in£ = £310,407 £53,752
This shows that whereas in the six years to Decem-
ber, 1903, a total of £72,000 had been paid into
the funds to get rid of this debt, in the past three
years no less than £176,159 has been available.
This is quick going ; but the management has a long
journey still ahead. The amount still owing is
£693,685, and towards this the bank holds £53,752,.
leaving £639,936 to be made up out of profits.
In the past half-year the total available has been
£36,159. If the bank could put that much by
every six months, the last of the debt would be
bowed off the premises in about nine years. Whether
that can be done depends very largely upon what the
next nine years have in store for Queensland. The
bank is pretty certain to have a great deal of the
best that is going in the State, for, apart from the
fact that it does the Government’s business, it stands
firmly in the affections of the bulk of old Queens-
landers.
When the last of the debt has gone, shareholders
should be in for a good time, provided things go well
with the State, since the total share capital is only
£413,591.' In addition to the capital and reserves,
the bank has the use of £8,870,299 of the public’s
money, as well as £258,293 of the State’s. Disre-
garding the latter amount, which is repayable by
three instalments (in 1919, ’2O and ’2l, respect-
ively), it will be seen that for every £1 of its own
it has the handling of about £l6 14s. of other
people’s. In ordinary circumstances this would be
a perilous proportion, but included in the
£8,870,299 there is £3,091,669 of interminable
stock, which is as good as preferential capital. In-
evitably the investment of so much of other people’s
money means big risks for the shareholders, because,
their capital has to stand the racket when any of
the investments stand out too badly to be. covered
by current profits or reserves. On the other hand,
all going well, profits should be glittering. And so
far as the interminable deposits are concerned, the
position is all the more alluring because they carry
only 3| p.c. It is worth noting that for the first
time no part of the profit is written off during the
past half-year. This may be taken as a very broad
hint that in the management’s opinion assets are'
now dowp to or below their market value. Cer-
tainly, in view of the boom conditions that prevail
in Queensland, assets might very well stand in the
books at something under their present value. The
chances are that internal provision has been made
for shrinkage. At any rate, it is almost incredible
that the real profits of the bank have not increased
more than the published accounts have shown—an
increase exhibited in the first table. If more has
been made of late years it has been socked awav to
meet unforeseen contingencies.
Summing up the changes that have been made in
the look of things, we get this result: —

The most decrepid looking item there consisted of
assets that were not considered good enough to be
included with the advances. This item has now dis-
appeared entirely; either the assets have improved
or they have been written down to normal values.
The next comparison shows the movements in the
past 12 months and 10 years:—

The bank has thus added £714,748 to its advances
during the year, and considering the high level at
which most securities have stood, there is room for
a good deal of bad business in that, unless the man-
agement has been extra cautious. Notwithstanding
the big increase in advances and the repayment of
Government debt, deposit money has come in so well
that the liquid assets still amount to £2,986,866.
This is 51.7 p.c. of all deposits, bills payable and
other debts, which the bank may be called upon to
pay within the next two or three years—an ex-
ceptionally strong position, and one which makes
it possible to oblige customers to some considerable
extent further.

Greater Sydney is supplied with gas by three com-
panies, two State Houses of Parliament and about 50
municipal councils. This particular co.’s territory
is on the north side of the harbor —a district which
has put on population at a great speed during the
last few years. Ten vears ago its capital was
£112,500; to-day it is £195,109. On April 30,
1911, 30,000 new shares were issued at par to exist-
ing shareholders. On these 10s. had been paid as at
June 30, and another ss. is at present being got in.
This issue, of course, amounts to a bonus, inasmuch
as 10 p.c. is being paid on the sum called. This
next comparison shows a few other things:—
1902. 1912.
Paid capital .. . .£112,500 £195,109

Fixed assets .. .. 123,018 252,756
Other assets . . . . 16,457 27,492
Thus, £82,609 extra capital has been got in, and
£140,773 has been spent in plant, mains, stores,
etc., while the. liabilities remain practically the
same. On the co.’s own admission, the business
has provided (1) the dividends and (2) mains,
plant, etc., valued at £.58,164. This does riot,
however, mean that the earnings have been only
£58,164 in excess of the dividends, very substantial
though that surplus would be, because an unknown
amount appears to be written off against deprecia-
tion. . No doubt most of this written off has been
put into plant and mains. The published accounts
are mere skeletons, but they leave an impression that
the company has got itself into an extraordinarily
solid position. The directors, indeed, virtually admit
that much when they pay 10 p.c. on new 'capital.
Hitherto, the co. has had. no opposition whatever.
Both the other gas companies have more or less com-
petition from municipal and other electric light sup-
plies ; and it seems now likely that this North Shore
co. will sustain a similar bump. A private co. is
negotiating with the councils, and even if nothing
comes of that, the City of Sydney will offer to take
its mains across the harbor. The local bumbles will
probably object to this, but when a Greater Sydney
arrives the gas co. will have competition right
enough. And North Sydney will have a cheaper sup-
ply of light and power, and probably also won’t have
to ring up so often to complain of the quality of the
substance that it does get.
But even before a Greater Sydney. arrives, trouble
may hit this and other gas cos. A Bill has been
prepared in the Treasury to regulate the prices and
dividends of these companies. The idea is to fix a
standard dividend and a standard price, and to re-
quire a company to reduce the price simultaneously
with any increase in the dividend beyond the stand-
ard. The plan will probably be to compel companies
to give consumers the benefit of one penny per thou-
sand feet for each extra i p.c. dividend. There
will be some trouble in fixing the standards, because,
while they charge the same for gas, the Australian
(Sydney) Gaslight Co. 'pays 15 p.c., whereas this
North Shore co. pays only 10. Therefore, if 10 p.c.
were the standard dividend and 3s. 9d. the standard
rate, the North Shore Co, could leave its rate where
it is, while the bigger co. would have to haul down
its price wholesale. A sliding scale is attached to
the Metropolitan (Melbourne) Gas Co.’s Act, but the
standard price is fixed so high that the scale is of no
value. Moreover, the co. has dodged the law by the
simple process of paying for practically all additions
made during many years past out of profits. To be
of much effect, any N.S.W. law must prescribe in
some way the amount of profits which a co. may
divert for this purpose.

This co. was formed to give effect to a private bill,
which authorised the laying of mains, etc., in Bal-
main and other suburbs. Very soon after business
was started at Balmain negotiations were entered
into with other councils, and at the present time the
co. has rights to supply Newtown, Leichhardt, Peter-
sham and Ashfield, the last-named having been added
to the list within the six months. Originally the co.
had a capital of £50,000, including £7OOO issued
in shares to the promoters. Subsequent extensions
called, for more capital, which was provided by first
mortgage debentures. The addition of Ashfield to
the list has called for still more money, and within
the last few days the public has been asked to put
up. £50,000 on second debentures, carrying a very
solid 7 p.c. As at June 30 the total indebtedness
to debenture-holders was £62,318. The co.
started with a goodwill paper asset of over £lO,OOO,
since increased to £12,033. This is being written
down, though not rapidly. The business is growing
fast, but a great part of it is not likely to show
large profits, as the company is under an obligation
not to charge more for current than the City of Syd-
ney would supply it at; and the City of Sydney does
not seek profits—all it wants is interest, a small
sinking fund and provision for renewals. With a
heavy debenture debt the risks taken by shareholders
are considerable, seeing that the debenture-holders’
interest and principal stand ahead ; but in good times
the shareholders benefit, because the whole of the sur-
plus earnings, after paying interest, belong to them.

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in
transmission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller
Bearings save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent,
of oil, so one of the first duties is naturally for
engineers to direct their special attention to these
bearings and to car boxes for trucks. Hyatts are
in continuous use in Cement Works, Ore Dressing
Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bushings of
flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, they can apply to the Australian Agents,
W. and J. Lempriere, Melbourne; or E. W. Hurst-
house and Co., of Wellington, the agents in New
Zealand.*

After considerable discussion on the advantages and
disadvantages of the mechanical stonebreaking as
against the handbreaking, the Bacchus Marsh Shire
Council (Vic.) decided in favor of the mechanical
method, and, on comparing the various makes of
machine, decided, that the one most suited to their
needs was the Bigelow Patent Stone Crusher. They
purchased a 16in. x 9in. portable machine, and from
their engineer’s various reports on the matter they
are more than satisfied with it.
From June to September the Council crushed and
spread 3000 cub. yards of road metal at an average
cost of 2/6 per cub. yard; and the cost of spalls per
cub. yard averaged 2/4, making a total cost of 4/10
per cub. yard broken and spread. Their last con-
tract under the hand-breaking system amounted to
6/3 per cub. yard, stacked on the roadside ; and
spreading 1/-; total 7/3, as against the 4/10 of the
mechanical system. Saving, 2/5 per cub. yard. These
figures speak for themselves to those interested in
the matter.
The Bigelow breakers, which are also largely used
by the mining companies of Australia, are manu-
factured by the Austral Otis Engineering Company,
South Melbourne, who will be glad to answer en-
quiries.* [3

Hill people have faith in the thing. We must have

General-manager Bellinger, of the Great
Cobar (N.S.W.), addressed a meeting of the mining
engineers in an appreciative strain. Ihe output has
recently' shown improvement, and the lnanagei ex-
pects to maintain the pace, for he predicts a yearly
output of 10,000 tons of copper, 50,0000 z. gold and
250 OOOoz. of silver. As to actual results, the quar-
ter to June 30 gave 2011 tons of copper, 13,9990 z.
gold and 71,6910 z. silver. This is an approximate
estimate, based on assays from blister copper. lor
18 months, to June 30, 1911, Great Oobar produced
9652 tons of copper, 36,6480 z. of gold and 174,6570 z.
silver from 478,472 tons of ore and 128,319 tons of
furnace products (total, 606,791 tons) ; so, appar-
ently, the concentrator and smelting plant will re-
quire to work up an enormous tonnage of crude ore
to turn out 10,000 tons of copper. The workings
have vet to be proved below 1300 ft. on the big
pyritic ore body, about half that depth on the gold
mine, and at 1000 ft. in the Ohesney. Since 1869
the total output has been some 100,000 tons, but
spread over 43 years it is left behind by the Wallaroo
and Moonta. Total amounts paid have been: Great
Cobar, £788,500; Wallaroo and Moonta, £2,119,250.

Cope’s Creek Central (N.S.W.) closed its
half-year with a profit of £5307. There are 30,000
shares; so this concern, owing to high prices,
has been able to hand out numerous dividends. The
total declared to date is £27,750 (18s. 6d. per
share). The paid-up capital is only £7500, for the
shares were issued at ss. each; so, on a percentage
basis, the return is three star.

“Quidam” : A point not realised by many
investors in alluvial mining is the unreliability of
sample bores in loose, shingly ground, due to concen-
tration of the auriferous or stanniferous contents by
the vibrating action of the drill on boulders. In
sample boring only the material inside the bore, the
legitimate core, is, or should be, counted in com-
puting results. If (say) piping or casing is
pushed down 4ft., the 4ft. of material inside it is
preserved and tested. This is right so long as the
casing goes down smoothly, but when it comes down
on a boulder, a chisel-shaped bit has to be attached
as a drill, and this is dropped on to the boulder
till it is smashed or pushed to one side, after which
the casing is pushed down again and a sample
taken. The effect of the hammering action of the
bit in loose wash, is to set up a vibratory motion,
which has a tendency to induce heavy metal-
lic particles in the vicinity to slide downwards
towards the centre of the disturbance, practically to
create a sort of inverted cone, down which the matter
of superior specific gravity slides to the apex, or
under the casing. It follows that when the casing is
pushed down, this enriched portion is apt to become
part of the core, and lead to serious discrepancies
in regard to estimated and real values. With a
hard, “cementy” wash these conditions do not hold.
On information received, Chaffers (W.A.)
has started out west at 1600 ft., to look for the
continuation southward of the Ivanhoe Middle, other-
wise known as the Golden Horseshoe No. 2 lode.
Except at the No. 1 level no serious attempt was
ever made in Horseshoe ground to follow this shoot
to the Chaffers boundary till lately, when the spirit
moved someone in charge to do so at 1200 ft. Here
it maintains good values until about 100 ft. from
the dividing line, when poor stuff is met with.
Chaffers is now gambling on the undoubted southerly
dip in the shoot bringing it over the boundary at
1600 ft. But if so, what then? The supposed track
of the shoot lies so far away from the co.’s present
workings, that to get at and develop it would involve
an expenditure of anything between £70,000 and
£BO,OOO on a new shaft and equipment. It could be
opened up for about half that cost by getting the
loan of, and operating from, the Horseshoe workings ;
but should the co. have the luck to strike anything
worth having, it could not do better than sell its
right, title and interest to the Horseshoe, as the
values in this particular ore body at depth are too
spotted to warrant the outlay of much money on spec.

On March 31 South Kalgurlie was esti-
mated to have, exclusive of 10,321 tons of broken ore
in stopes, 185,750 tons of developed stone of a gross
average value of 6.4dwt., and 95,785 tons of
“probable” ore of Bdwt. grade. Compared with the
published reserves of six months previous, the gains
are 12,550 tons of developed and 28,265 tons of
“probable” ore, and in value a few grains per ton.
The increases are due to more than usual quantities
of fully and partially developed ore being taken into
account, and to all-round improvement in the grade of
the stopes on the east lode at the No. 8 level. This
mine is looking a good deal better than it used to,
and the maintenance of the present 10 p.c. dividend
is assured for some time.
* * ’ * *
Up to date, Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) has,
as a result of getting the Boulder lode, had the
following history: (1) Crosscut 15ft. of SOdwt. ore
just inside the north boundary at 2780 ft. (2) Cut
7ft. of 25dwt. ore at 240 ft. south of the north
boundary at 2630 ft. (3) Driven 62ft. north on
same in lOdwt. ore and south 110 ft., the second last
10ft. averaging 50z., and the last 10ft. some ounces.
(4) Bored through 27ft. of ore, the core assay being
18dwt. at 460 ft. south of the 278 ft. level, and sub-
sequently proved same by crosscutting from the Great
Boulder’s Edwards shaft to be worth 6dwt. per ton.
(5) Intersected somewhere overhead at 2480 ft., 24ft.
of 25dwt. ore, which the first 10ft. of driving in-
creased to 3ft. in width, and to soz. in value, while m
the next sft. it bulged to 4ft. in width and to 15oz.
value. Driving has been stopped and crosscutting
to the Horseshoe shaft resumed. All the above de-
velopments look very attractive at first glance, but
the outlook is not nearly so dazzling as some of the
puffs which the local papers- have given the mine
would lead one to suppose. For instance, the 15oz.
ore at 2480 ft. is but the downward continuation of
an enrichment of about 30ft. to 40ft. in length,
which has helped to sweeten the averages and make
up for the poor spots in the Boulder ground from
1900 ft., where it was first cut, down to the point
where it enters the Horseshoe. Consequently, most
of the boosting reports published about its great
possibilities are mere flam. On further development
it may prove to average 50z., and with it included .the
grade' of the whole of the payable section on the
lode in the Horseshoe ground will probably not be
much over the ounce and may be less. Therefore its
acquisition, and that of the lode to boot, are not
likely to enrich the mine’s present Bdwt.- reserves
more than a dwt. or two for a long time to come, and
perhaps not even then. The prospect for good divi-
dends isn’t, at all events for the time being, improved
much after all. # * *
Ivanhoe is beginning to look dicky in the
bottom workings. Recently the glum am
nouncement was made that the pa y . , j
shown the lode to be almost wholly unpayabl le d
the south end of the two deepest levels, at 227(Jtt ana
9420 ft Since then nothing has been done at 2270 ft.,
hf,t nt 2420 ft some 300 ft. of driving north has
revealed scarcely anything else but “traces, whi e
southward only a few short lengths ot payaoie oie
interspersed with blank patches have been exposed.
There L no reason why this i-povenshment should
nthpr than temporary, except that ail mines soone
or latlr and ultimately become unpayable
in depth.” Meantime, the poor results obtained from
development work at the level mentioned must soon
be reflected on the ore reserves.*
At the Bullfinch meeting, G. P. Doolette
forecasted a monthly profit of £12,000 on the treat-
ment of 6000 tons. This optimistic estimate has led
a guileless paper in the West to declare that this
means an annual surplus of £144.000, and, with de-
preciation and development taken off, a clear
£lOO 000 for dividends. It does nothing of the kind.
For one thing, Doolette did not. say how many months
such a profit could be maintained, and, for another
thin" unlike the writer who quoted him, he was too
let his imagination run riot in this way.
* * *
“Why don’t some of the big Kalgoorlie
mining cos. spend a bit of their surplus cash on the
north end of the field?” plaintively asks someone in
the London Mining Journal. The answer is simple
enough. Because they have more horse sense than
the inquirer. Despite all the local bullish screech
about the great value of the reefs and lodes m this
part of the district very little gold is. being obtained.
There is no field for company enterprise there. Nowa-
days it is fossickers’ ground only, and ’,f“ ept
small, isolated patches, poor at that. A lot of gold
was obtained in the early days from small reefo m
shallow ground, but mostly everything went wrong
in depth, and now the landscape is dotted with aban-
doned dumps. Tombstones on the graves of capital,
someone called them.
* * *
Having seen the Lake View and Star
CW A ) The Bulletin begs to modify its former
opinion of it. Much has been done towards improv-
ing the mine’s appearance during the past year, and
at present there seems to be a good chance of
the present dividend being maintained foi the next
three years at least. In fact, m its own little (or
rather bi") low-grade wav, it is one of the most solid
shows' on the field. Shaft-sinking below 2000 ft has
been resumed after a long .spell, and when 2100 ft is
reached a crosscut is to be put m and some drivi g
done to pick up the continuation of the payable shoot
exposed some time ago at the No 19 level and to a
depth of 150 ft. in a winze sunk below that level. It
has a length of about 150 ft. * *
Slab of optimism from G'. P. Doolette’s
speech at the Great Boulder meeting: “There is
nothing in the outlook to unduly distress share-
holders It is our intention to continue prospecting
with the diamond drill below 3000 ft and there is yet
a possibility that the lost lode will return to us at
creater depth, as it did in the upper levels The
mine is no P t the worked-out proposition that some of
the Jeremiahs would have it believed.” Doolette may
believe all this, and expect those who listened to
him to believe also. But except for the statement about
the property being worked out, the management
doesn’t believe it, and has openly said so for the
past year or more. * * *.
South Kalgurli (W.A.) management throws
out an estimate of reserves occasionally. . The latest
(t 0 March, 1912) is 185,750 tons, averaging 6 4dwt
per ton making a total of 59,4400 z., worth, at £4
per oz.,’ £237,760. The estimate, dated September,
1911 gave 173,200 tons, averaging 6.ldwt. ; total,
52 2760 z. ( £209,124). There is. a difference of
£28,636 in favor of the latest estimate. Costs are
ground down to a fine point, so, if the stoping llimt
?s increased, it is quite on the cards that expenses
will swallow most of the £28,000. Then develop-
ment work is costly, and would be a heavy burden
if the S. Kalgurli did not handle a big tonnage of
low-grade ore. How long it will keep going no one
knows for certain ; its limited area of 12 acres, and
the fact that boundary developments, are low-grade is
rather against a big find. Still, it is a well situated
block, and the memory of its close neighbor—the
Perseverance —has raised many a hope of better
times. # * * *
Another flotation proposal comes alpng
from Cloncurry (Queensland), but this time it is a
gold show of 40 acres, about 10 miles south-
east of the town. A couple of small reefs can be
distinguished by the naked eye; and one has been
worked to a shallow depth by one or two shafts A
thousand tons have somehow been scratched together
as a reserve, said to average £5 10s. per ton. ksti-
mated cost is only 255., though both wood and water
are scarce, and the plant is a ricketty affair that
needs a lot of doctoring up. Capital to be £15,000
in £1 shares—6ooo to the public and 2000 in re-
serve. Vendors’ cut not stated, but at least it can
be taken as 7000 fully-paids, and perhaps a cash
consolation. The property has been reported on by
one of the provisional directors, who accepted the
samples of an unknown M.E. What is an M.E. .
By the way, the name of the venture is the Gilded

Many Peaks Copper Co. (Q.) has paid
two dividends, totalling £5612 155., in. six months.
This concern is in 81,640 shares, and dividends will
continue to drop in steadily while Mount Morgan
takes from 8000 to 10,000 tons of pyritic ore from
the Peaks, at a royalty of 2s. 6d. per ton Under
present conditions the revenue should exceed £12,000
per annum, or say, 2s. 6d. per share after allowing
for office expenses. \
* * * *
For the half-year Gympie (Q.) crushed
65,432 tons for 23,4200 z. gold. Oriental Consols, at
a depth of 2600 ft., has a crosscut 1400 ft. from the
shaft. Both the Scottish Gympie and No. 2 S.
Great Eastern are delving below 2000 ft. in the Ingle-
wood deeps. The Scottish has been crushing stone
worth slightly over 20s. per ton, and paying quarterly
dividends of ljd. per share. # #
New Brilliant Freehold (Charters Towers)
struck 2ft. of mineralised stone in No. 5 level (254 ft.
west), but the market has no great fancy for Free-
holds at present. For June, 1453 tons were crushed
for £3017, so the mine should be paying its. way
with something to spare.
* * * *
The Brilliant P.C. (Charters Towers) will
sink another winze on the Day Dawn formation. The
connecting level from the Brilliant shaft is deeper than
the old level driven from the Freehold’s boundary.
This is unfortunate, because it entails a great deal
more work to prospect the Day Dawn formation.
The Stockholm mine, belonging to the Brilliant P.C.,
crushed 714 tons for £2994. Returns from the
Stockholm have been highly payable for some time
past - * * * *
Brilliant Deeps (Charters Towers) have
doubled in value since July 1, when buyers quoted
15s. There are 180,000 shares, so at 30s. per share
the total climbs to £225,000. Pretty good
lor a show that has yet to appear on the dividend
list. No doubt London cabled a few orders. Then
there is the memory of the Queen Cross excitement,
and still later the New Brilliant Freehold’s boom.
No. 5 level is 130 ft. below No. 4, following the
underlay. Assuming that the hanging-wall reef,
showing 3ft. of good stone at the end of No. 5,
trends easterly as it is risen on, there should be a
good block between the levels. The manager reports
that the highly mineralised stone has every appear-
ance of coming back east over No. 5 level. The reef,
as stoped over No. 4, has also an easterly trend, a
peculiarity that )s worth noting, because if the reef
trends easterly as risen on, it will certainly have a
westerly trend at deeper levels, improving the pro-
spects ahead of No. 5.
* * * *
At Charters Towers the Papuan Brilliant
and Victoria co. is sinking deeper on the Moonstone
reef, and the latest news is that the shaft —which is
following the underlay—has 18in. of payable stone
in the bottom. The Moonstone did not show par-
ticularly good form in the olden days, so prospects
of an extensive payable area below the present work-
ings are speculative. The Queen Cross shaft should
soon meet with the Moonstone reef, as it is nearly
down to the estimated depth. A small leader was
cut in sinking.
Kelly’s Queen Block is pushing on with the
development of the St. George reef. Another level
to the north has been started off the underlie. As
proved in the level overhead, prospects are likely to
improve some distance further in. The future is
uncertain, but the St. George reef should -be worth
prospecting below the present depth of 657 ft. Stone
continues to be raised from the cross reef (1450 ft.),
and the Brilliant Central is driving.for this forma-
tion below Kelly’s boundary.
* * * *
Brilliant Blocks (Charters Towers) have
been perseveringly crosscutting through the granite
towards the Deeps’ boundary. The formation aimed
at is the footwall reef, worked at lower levels by
the B. Deeps, whose deepest level is 2609 ft. from the
surface. The old western workings in the Deeps
carried a very capricious reef, but a good make of
stone was trending upwards above No. 1 level to-
wards the B. Blocks’ boundary, from which stone was
stoped and sent to the mill. That is not the only
chance either, because No. 4 level took a course
further south than was expected, and came within
40ft. of the Blocks’ boundary. So erratic was the
course taken by No. 4 that many people considered
it was following a branch reef. It was intended to
rise up from the end of No. 4 and connect with the
deepest winze from the old workings, which at the
bottom shows a strong reef, but this divergence from
the anticipated course of the level prevented that.
Naturally, the B. Blocks consider there is a chance
of striking some of the good stone. The crosscut is
in 520 ft.

“Kobbi”: The wrangle between the ven-
dors of the Limestone mine (Q.) and the Mount
Elliott co. (which bought it) has ended. The syndi-
cate got the verdict, and keeps the ore at grass at
time of sale, and Mount Elliott gets a bill for costs.
* * * *
Mount Elliott closed its financial year in
good heart, because electrolytic copper during the
last month (June) averaged over £79 per ton. This
is very much higher than the average for the 11
month's to June 30. Smelting was started in Sep-
tember, 1911, so there has been 10 months work,
less time lost owing to strikes, which reduced the
output for December, January and February:—

For the previous financial year the smelting time

smelted for 5466 tons of blister copper. Total for
two years, 82,552 tons of ore, which produced 10,751
tons of blister. The latter is from 97 to 98 p.c. pure
copper, and contains from £7 to £8 worth of pre-
cious metals.
* * * *
The Cook-Powell-McArthur River (N.T.)
prospecting looks like petering out as cheer-
lessly, though not as abruptly, as did the
near-by Maroomba field. One big line of out-
crops bored into yielded a blank. Now Cook s
lode has drawn a blank, for after drilling
330 ft. in mineralised limestone, the best assay got
only went 7 p.c. zinc, 6) p.c. lead and loz. silver.
So the manager advises the Board not to increase
the drill footage contract. Bendigo shareholders
didn’t like this chuck-up, but Bull won’t find further
charm in the liquid name of Booroolooloo when he
hears how burst things are in this latest Northern
Terror.
* * * *
Victoria learns, seven months after date,
from its Mines Department, that its gold yield for
1911 was 504,0000 z., of the value of £2,140,855.
This output is 66,3030 z. less than in 1910, due to
the working out of deep leads and the general poverty
of returns from the quartz mines of the State. Duke
and Main leads, Maryboro’, led the van among the
alluvial shows, but it only returned 11,6360 z. Cen-
tral Red, White and Blue was at the top among the
quartz claims, with 20,6890 z. got from 16 457 tons.
So there wasn’t a mine in the State which, for the
year, put up a record equal to that for a month of
one of the Kalgoorlie aristocrats.
* * * *
That mournful procession of misery, the
Gippsland Copper Co., with its Happy gold mine,
isn’t to be interred without another appeal of the
Aids to the In.iured type. Those of the Mount Lyell
staff who found the mine and financed the first float,
have doubtless learned a bit of wisdom, and likewise
may have dropped a bit of cash. What has been
learnt is that a metallurgical tangle isn t always
quite so easy to unravel as a happy, self-confident
directorate may imagine. Still the idea is to cling
to mother’s apron strings, as shareholders now ascer-
tain that if they put up the stuff “arrangements have
been made for supplies of suitable residual pyrites
from the Mount Lyell M. and R. Co.” Isn’t there
any iron ore in Gippsland to smelt the 5000 tons
of' copper ore that is bursting out the mine stones
in its haste to pile up profits on the Board table?
This ore has been sampled as likely to go 3J
p c copper, loz. gold, lOdwt. silver and 2|dwt.
platinum. So there is plenty of variety, if nothing
else to look to if only a financial shove-off can be
arranged. This ought not to be an Olympic feat, as
there should be a gamble in such material. But it
will be a hard road to get the furnaces at work on
a smelting sprat of £9OO, as seems to he suggested.
* * * *
New Specimen Hill, Daylesford (Vic.),
was floated purely on the strength of a has-been
record. All the punching and picking down of stone
in the old bright days didn’t swell averages to much
over the sdwt. grade. The tally begun by the new
battery last week is a shilling or two better than that
of the sad old times that ended in the shutting up
of the plant and the stoppage of work. Ballarat, as
usual, potted Melbourne when the shooting out of
Specimen Hill scrip came to be done. It is ever
thus, as per the North Nuggetty flutter, when Queen-
street got all the" kicks and the bumpkins raked in
the ha’pence. Yet a Yank like Hugo Meyer, in his
Akgus dodger on privately-owned railways, wails over
the decadence of Ballarat and the impoverishment of
Bendigo. Why, the toffy Collins House push, ever
since it passed on the Duke United to Bull, prefers
the risks of the hunting field to trying to ride the
high horse over the Ballarat paddocks.
* * * *
The little lead smeltery at Zeehan (Tas.)
is unobtrusively doing, with some small amount of
help from the Tasmanian Government, what Broken
Hill would give much to know how to do
with its ores. Metallurgist Harris gives the
average assays: 9.2 p.c. lead, 28s. 6d. ;
11.30 z. silver, 255. lid. ; o.lBoz. gold, 14s.
sd. ; total, £3 Bs. 10d., irrespective of from 20 to
27 p.c. zinc, which, to effect a recovery of the lead,
silver and gold, has to be slagged off. Treatment
costs ran to £2 7s. 6d., after delivery from Zeehan
railway station. The Hercules mine supplies most of
the ore, and that co. is making a net profit of a few
shillings per ton, after paying for mining and trans-
port. In the light of what is being done at Zeehan
a wider field opens for the Australian smelter. The
monthly mixture at Zeehan is 3500 tons of refractory
ore, with 700 tons of galena and 2000 tons of metal-
bearing flux. It is claimed that the recoveries of
silver, lead and gold are very close to the assay.
The slag contains 20 p.c. zinc oxide.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, July 22, 1912.
My Dear Arini, —
The committee of the Women’s Handicrafts
Society, or some new members of it, have sud-
denly pushed the invaluable Mrs. Pritchard
Bassett off the president’s stool, to make
vacant the place for the Cullen lady. For
cold and brutal ingratitude to one of the
three enthusiasts who founded this society
a year or so ago —one who has actually held
its conflicting forces together by her tact
and devotion —this piece of snobbery holds
the championship against all comers.
The president of any executive committee
of pussies is generally a lay figure, quite as
useful as a rag doll. She is (for choice)
wrapped in the National Anthem, and is the
wife of a Governor or sub-Governor. The
notion that she will attract a large following
of sycophants is partly true. But there are
several species of parasites who trail at the
heels of Personages, and give nothing to the
cause with a consistent explosion of gush.
The Cullen dame frankly admits that she
takes the presidency in its restricted official
sense — i.e., as a rubber stamp.
A worker on the Arts and Crafts side (in
the Women’s Snobicrafts Society) tore up
the stairs of this office, flopped into a chair,
collected her breath, and gasped out the news
that the working members of the ex-llandi-
crafts (now Snobicrafts) were “flabber-
gasted” at the treatment of their president.
“We were not consulted, and didn’t even
know till the thing was done. If Mrs.
Bassett had been like the average cat-mittee
lady, she would have walked out of the
meeting and had nothing more to do with the
society. Instead, she will go on doing all the
work, as usual, while” She rang off, by
request, to remark in milder italics that the
members had presented their popular ex-
president with a vellum address, decorated
with native flowers. Mrs. Munday handed
her a piece of pottery. Miss Molly Mans-
field, Miss Richards (China painting), Miss
Leist (a beaten copper tray). Miss Tooth
(a cunning matchbox filled with the mem-
bers’ tears), and many other flabbergasted
workers took part in the memorial service.
Prof. MacCallum got on the trail of poet
Browning, in the King’s Hall the other
night. City and suburban Browning-fights
are popular institutions. Enthusiasts put on
their storm boots and sou’-westers to brave
the flooded atmosphere, while MacCallum
handled the well-known story of Browning’s
hereditary impetus to dash into metre at
the age of six summers or so. Obviously, he
began too young. If his precocious snap
at verse had been spanked out of him for a
few years, spectacled societies to-day
wouldn’t band themselves together into
solemn intelligence departments, and read
him upside down, and marvel at him side-
ways, and consider him backwards, and,
finally, fall back insensible, asking what on
earth he meant by it, and whether he was
raving mad, or only intoxicated, or possibly
dead.
The Dental Conference, which raged round
the aching tooth and the acquired ivories,
produced some dressy dames from overseas.
Amongst the American contingent was Mrs.
Johnson, of “Shecawgo,” where the canned
meat comes from. She is the wife of a
dental surgeon who is an authority on
molars, and edits a journal devoted to the
Sorrows of the Satanic eating apparatus.
The lady (and her two attractive daugh-
ters) showed our girls some revelations in
frocks.
Bondi and Waverley are without a School
of Arts, and they begin to feel rather hurt
about it. Before this arises in the eastern
section of the literary sky, about 400 per-
sons will have hopped together, at a dance
in Paddington Town Hall, in aid of the
funds of a building which may, or rtiay not.
stand with its face to a Bondi breaker, and
its back windows staring at Waverley.
“School of Arts,” by the way, is a glaring
alias for a circulating library, etc. It is
one of the traditions that sailed to these
shores from the Land of Hodge, though in
the Hodge country it is sometimes called a
Mechanics’ Institute.
The Imperial Roller Rink breaks out in
a Cinderella Carnival this (Monday) even-
ing. Prizes jump up to the collective value
of considerably over £lOO. As the clock
strikes 12, the glory of the colored electric
bulb will fade into plain wet night, through
which will drift streaks of fancy language
when goloshes stick in the
muddy street.
A Grand Roman Carnival is going to shake
the rafters of the Stadium amphitheatre on
August 15. The proceeds will be handed
over to the Alexandra Hospital for sick chil-
dren. Artists Dattillo Rubbo and Souter will
lead what is called “a strong art sub-com-
mittee” (it sounds like a tug of palettes
between rival brush champions) into humor-
ous . tableaux and sketch competitions.
“Snowy” Baker has sworn to put his muscle
into the management of a section of gladi-
ators, and the mailed fist will wave under
Mr. Baker’s supervision. The ladies’
committee will get into Roman drapery for
the occasion. Every dame will do her top-
most to look as much like the widow of
Julius Caesar, or Pompey’s aunt, or the Ma
of the Gracchi, as circumstances and the
local dressmaker permit. Mrs. Vincent
McCauley is lion. sec. of dames.
Arthur Streeton, Fullwood, H. S. Power,
of Adelaide (all now in London), Hayley
Lever (another Adelaide man at present
making a fuss on the artistic anthill of the
biggest city of this earth), Thorpe (of Syd-
ney), and other Australians abroad are send-
ing a steadv trickle of their wares to the
Fine Arts Rooms, in Bligh-street. Power is
pushing forward as an animal painter. A
bold study of heads, legs and tails called “The
Tufters” is now on view. It is a spirited
example of this artist’s trick of line and color
with horse and hounds. Arthur Burgess
(Sydney) is working out his special taste
for billows in English sea-scapes. Several
of these samples of the heaving main, as it
flogs the British coast, are now hanging in
the Fine Arts’ Society’s winter twilight.
Burgess, like Power and Lever, was a suc-
cessful exhibitor in the R.A. this year. Lever,
who spends a good deal of time on the stormy
brow of St. Ives (Cornwall), pursues the
fishing smack for some of his favorite epi-
sodes in oils. He struck gold in a recent
commission for a decoration for the Carnegie
Institute.
Mr. Burma-rubber Thane recently
descended from the paternal nest at Yass,
to have a look at Sydney’s rain-washed
pavements. His return to the jungle is not
mapped out as a fixture.
The golfing Misses Fowlds (M.L.) hur-
riedly unpacked their kit in this town for
a day or two after chasing the small white
ball in Melbourne. They leave for Auck-
land before this meets your lynx-eyed glance.
Journalist J. M. Geddis, who owns and
edits the Wellington (M.L.) Free Lance,
is at present peering through the breaking
of the drought in this wet clachan. Ink runs
in the Geddis family in a steady trickle, for
the brother of J. M. is W. J. Geddis, part
proprietor of the Auckland Observer and
Napier Telegraph.
Mr. Harry Horton, chairman of the M.L.
Press Association, and part owner of the
N.Z. Herald, is at present straying round
these shores on a holiday cruise.
Re ex-Minister McNab, of the late Ward
team (M.L.), I hear that he leaves the
Dominion on Friday, July 26. In answer to
inquiries about his moorings in these water-
lapped parts, I may mention the oldest tome
in the Mitchell Library as his most perman-
ent address.
The woolly Hills, from the icy blasts of
Yass Plains, are sheltering in a fashionable
Sydney hostel. Yass society, wrapped to its
eyelids in ’possum rugs and wind-proof rab-
bit-skins, has had sucb a raging epidemic of
bridge and two-step that it is stealthily
creeping to town in sections. It proposes to
try some music for the benefit of its frayed
nerves and its staring and staggered eye.
A morning paper mentioned the “14th
anniversary of the wedding of Mr. and Mrs.
Alfred Wedlock” the other day. The fact
that Mr. and Mrs. Grundy were present at
the Wedlock party, and got away with first
prizes at the anniversary euchre party, was
another quaint partnership in nomenclature.
A Mrs. Grundy at a Wedlock soiree appears
to be matter in the right place.
Mr. A. E. Hughes has bought Carthona
(Darling Point) from the Marcus Oldhams.
Carthona estate is a- desirable clod of earth
which slides down to the water’s edge, and
stands with its feet in the sea, and the eye of
its front attic window looking northward for
the Japanese invader.
Sydney’s last Anglican Dean, Cowper by
name, tottered off to his well-earned rest,
long after passing the official earth-mark,
tliree-score years and ten. Then Deans
seemed to fall into disrepair, and an insuffi-
ciency of them lurked in occasional Synod
discussions. They became a long-felt want,
and the scarcity grew noticeable. Gradually
the slump in Deans got down to bedrock. The
Synod counted its cash with a loud clatter
of threepenny-bits, and didn’t seem able to
afford the special brand of gaiters Sydney
ought to have. But the legs and the man
arrived the other day. The new Dean Tal-
bot, a brisk and healthy-looking cleric, rising
34, with no encumbrances, matrimonial or so
forth, stepped into the tame dissipation that
dogs the steps of Deans with tea and bun, at
Bishopscourt last week. The riot was a
children’s party.
Miss Marjory Thompson, of Darling
Point, left Sydney on Saturday for matri-
mony in the land of Smike and Dotheboys
Hall. The groom to be is Mr. Dinwiddy,
who is (or was) a le’tenant on H.M.S. Im-
pregnable.
Missionary Brown, who labored in the
heathen vineyard (Pacific islets) for 30
years or so, had the luck to escape the head-
hunters who mowed down some of his un-
fortunate fellow soul-snatchers. He was
one of the notable exhibits at the George
Earp party (Point Piper), which snared the
presence of the new Tetrarch of Fiji.
Sweet-Escott, the recently anointed Gov-
ernor of Fiji and the sunbaked islets thereof,
is not a new hand at the trade. He was
over-lord of the Leeward Islands for some
years. His first billet was the dry-as-dust
occupation of classical Prof, at the Royal
College, Mauritius, whence he climbed into
the more garish glare that flickers round the
head of an Island Excellency.
Astronomer Tebbutt (Windsor), who pur-
sues the stars in their course as a midnight
hobby, sent a coo-ee to Miss Mary Proctor,
who also revels in the same frivolous pas-
times. He asked the learned visitor to in-
spect his heavenly tools, or something of the
kind. The N.S.W. limb of the British
Astronomical Society in this city met the
Ddv with a stellar kiss. They asked her,
anyhow, to be present at their general meet-
ing on Friday evening. The items were
dazzling to those who like that especial kind
of dazzle. Imagine putting on your best
hat to meet the Planetesimal Hypothesis
of Such and Such. Or wearing a tight pair
of shoes in the presence of “Stellar spectro-
scopy and its evolutionary taxonomy.” If
Mary had tried to escape before the heavenly
bodies had finished 14 rounds in the Royal
Society’s rooms the other night, I fancy a
solar parallax would have chased her down
the street.
That wonderful old music-master, Josef
Ivretschmann, gave his annual pot-pourri
or extract of juvenile talent in the Town
Hall on Saturday night. Once a year this
incurable optimist, who has taught two gen-
erations of Sydney prodigies (and others) to
fiddle their way to fame (or draw the long
bow on the domestic hearth), breaks out m
a festival of youthful phenomena. Then is
the Town Hall just large enough to hold the
friends, admirers and parents of prodigies,
past, present and to come. The financial
results are always for the benefit of some-
thing that is straying on the road to Stony
Broke. This year the Distressed Musicians’
Fund gathered up the cash from the over-
flowing concert audience.
Ivretschmann is the benevolent godfather
of the aspiring child. For long years he has
been imposed on by scores who were quite
able to pay his fees. In his persistent search
for juvenile precocity he has found and
launched on the stormy sea of music
deserving pupils, some of whom made
an effort, later on, to repay the
delightful old enthusiast for his ser-
vices. Also, he has launched cold and
undeserving pupils—very many of them. The
serpent’s tooth of ingratitude has been so
numerous in his case that Ivretschmann
could stock the reptile house of the Zoo
single-handed. Presumably, he sets the suc-
cesses on the credit side of his amazing
financial scheme of life. The losses and the
impudent spongers pass out as “debit” with
a careless shrug of his godfatherly shoulders.
An orgy of white muslin, curls, small
satin shoes and very young fiddles raged
round the municipal platform, while the
only Ivretschmann dived into the under-
ground premises beneath the organ’s pipes
and dived up again. He produced his phe-
nomena in twos and threes, sat them down,
went off, was pursued by the youngest pro-
digy (who remembered something of breath-
less interest to whisper into the long locks of
the presiding angel), then toddled away to
inspect his little maidens in the artists’
room. The violin ensemble (with organ),
“Faust Fantasia,” was a charming perform-
ance by a mixed blend of pupils, chiefly girls,
with a sprinkle of small boy. Ivretschmann,
at the piano—conducting with one hand —
when there was one hand to spare—or rising
like a wild-haired tree to gaze reproachfully
at a young fiddler in a back row, was an in-
spiring spectacle. The audience might have
been so many heads of cabbage ; the veteran
was steeped in the wail of juvenile fiddle-
strings. Some day he may wear a halo the
size of a cartwheel, and conduct a celestial
choir of promising young seraphs.
“Tristan and Isolde,” by the Quinlan opera
co., dragged the motor herd from their even-
ing meal at the abnormal hour of seven or
thereabouts. They stamped in as sharp on
closing time as they dared. After conductor
Knoch (who hasn’t the Angelini streak of
cayenne in his temper) and fidgetted with his
forelock and stabbed the air with a prelim-
inary smack from his baton, the always late
and chattering first-nighters filled the stalls
with whiffs of orris root and damp boots.
A stage box showed a fluff of fair hair above
the winter wrap, which I diagnosed as the
property of Miss Kathleen Osborne. Minis-
ter Holman hurried in before the final raid
on the closing door. Mrs. Herbert Marks
was perched in a box with the nice-looking
Miss King and two swallow-tailed cavaliers.
The pretty Mrs. Brown kindly allowed Bin.
of osprey to droop at halfmast in a front
stall. This gave the second row a chance of
observing the long curly horns in Tristan’s
coiffure.
Agnes Nieholls, a beautiful Isolde (in spite
of a rather heavyweight figure), wore super-
lative garments on her voyage to the elderly
King Mark’s palatial stone cabin. Trailing
robes of pastel tints, embroidered with
emeralds, had a verdant green court train,
which the devoted handmaiden, Brangaena
(Edna Thornton), removed later on for
a sumptuous tail of cloth of gold
tissue. Tenor John Coates made up for the
romantic part of Tristan like a wild man of
the woods, in a fierce, tow-colored wig, with
ram’s-horn millinery, a shoulder drape like a
sad-brown tablecloth and etceteras to match.
John’s locks wanted the currycomb, but he
died unbrushed in the distracted embrace of
Agnes Isolde. Adonis Allen Hinckley got
into the Wagner picture as Mark of Corn-
wall, with a handsome pair of curly baa
horns, a good-looking tunic and nice leg-
gings. He was quite up to the beauty stan-
dard of the days when knighthood was in
bud and gent, one ran gent, two through the
waistband with a creaking sword if gent, one
even looked at the best girl of gent, two over
the edge of the Baron’s beer-barrel.
Governor Chelmsford and his lady and
the young Miss, their daughter (who comes
out at most musical arguments), with an
Aide or two (the benign, bumpy forehead of
the genial Help de Moleyns loomed over the
edge of the velvet parapet), were present
at the early evening sacrifice to “Tann-
hauser.” They had the best seats in the
house for opera—the front row of the dress
circle.
In “La Bohhme,” Enrichetta Onelli is the
Mimi every Rudolph is (or ought to be)
looking for. But a Mimi with a 20in. waist
and the charm of first youth is generally
below the vocal standard of a prima donna.
Little Onelli, with her sweet, thrush-like
twitter and fragile figure was an alluring
representation of the character, and Rudolph
de Gregorio made frantic love to her meek
collar. A cheerful Pagan suggests that per-
fection in “La Bolieme” may be snared bv
getting Melba to walk around and sing the
part, while Onelli flings her eyelashes down
and flutters through the love scenes. In
other words, that there should be a duplicate
Mimi—one-half to sing the part and the
other to look the part. Between them thev
would be the part, if they had any luck.
The “Girl of the Golden West” pushed
the dramatic Jeanne Brola, of the Quinlan
aviary, before the Sydney public. A South
African paper described Jeanne as “an
American of the Americans.” She lias Lees
of old Virginia, and Deanes of Tennessee
in her family locker. They had a sword in
their story, for this singer’s parent, General
Brooks, of the U.S. army, smote many foes
brown, white and piebald in the Mexican'
Indian and Civil Wars. Jeanne had to up-
lift her voice against Puccini’s noisy music
which overloads the Girl in the mining
camp with too much drum and cymbal. How-
ever, she saved her young man’s neck from
the clasp of a very ugly noose of rope, in a
cyclone of song.
Most afternoons at 3 o’clock the inspiring
sight of Hugh Mclntosh calling “tea oh!”
from some raised cranny of the being-roofed
Stadium may be seen and heard by the
casual passer-by. Fifty billycans and a
couple of gallons of milk or so flow from the
Mclntosh purse to the daily tea party. I
haven’t heard of an orchestra to wash down
the fluid, but that may come later.
The Austral String Quartet, with fiddler
Cyril Monk in charge, will have produced
a new composition by Alfred Hill before this
reaches you. During its genesis, the gas
will burn low in the jet, and the boots and
bodies of the performers will be buried
behind a screen.
The directors of George Marlow. Ltd.,
have lent the Adelphi Theatre (home of
“The Bad Girl of the Family”) for a benefit
matinee to actor Harry Diver. He has
broken down in health after long years of
servitude to the footlights, and mummers of
every shade of emotion, and every size in
stockpot menus, or musical comedy legs,
are rushing to his aid. August 1 will be
the date of the show.
Yours in goloshes,
VANDORIAN.
St. Peter’s Anglican Church, Campbell-
town (N.S.W.) lately celebrated its 89th
anniversary. It was built in 1823, at which
time Government built all the Anglican
churches with convict labor, and the con-
victs cursed the Archbishop of Canterbury
bitterly. There is a very ancient R.C. build-
ing on the top of the hill, and around it are
some of the most historic and moss-grown
tombstones in the State. There lie the re-
mains of Ruse, the man who planted the
first corn in Australia, a fact recorded on
the stone. In one grave are the well-flogged
bones of three comrades in arms, who fought
at Vinegar Hill in the Irish patriotic upris-
ing of 1798—the one that Garibaldi was
warned by some of his English supporters
not to speak about, wherefore that simple
Italian farmer was much astonished, not
having realised that the English believed in
freedom at Rome, but hated it at Kilkenny.
The names are _ inscribed on the stone. The
last of the trio was drowned crossing a
swollen creek. All three died bachelors, but
then the average old Irish patriot didn’t
care to marry, lest his wife should happen
to see the results of English misgovernment
on his back. The old R.C. church on the
hill sent the first R.C. Bishop to Victoria,
Dr. Goold having been parish priest there in
the mid-’4o’s, when Dr. Polding nominated
him for the Bishopric of Melbourne. There
are facsimiles of the Campbelltown Anglican
Church in many of th'e small towns of the
County of Cumberland—at Camden, Liver-
pool, Cobbitty, Mulgoa, etc.—all built at the
expense of the Government, with perhaps
the exception of Camden. It is mainly due
to the Macarthur family, which screwed the
money out of the tenants.
“Y.Z.”: I know an ancient and wealthy
doctor who, having had four or five wives,
used to be credited with keeping a list of
eligibles, with notes that might help him to
a wise choice should he have occasion to
make another. The doctor, however, had to
make his own list, and, so far as I know,
his own inquiries. That is where royalty
scores. It has this irksome job done for it.
Therefore I see in a “loyal” weekly print of
these southern parts a page of photographs
of girl royalties from whom the young Prince
of Wales is invited to take his pick. The
merits of each demure damsel as a candidate
for the office are concisely and pointedly
arranged, and the Prince is left to select or
toss for it, and thus decide which handmaiden
he should take to his bosom, and love pas-
sionately. Yet again the doctor may have
had the best of the argument in another way.
Probably almost every girl on his list had
been his patient at one time or another. He
had sounded her heart and her lungs; had
listened at the door of her chest; had slapped
her professionally on the bare back of over
the liver; knew something of her hair,
shoulders, feet and temper ; and had looked
into her mouth and decided on the genuine-
ness of her teeth. And all that knowledge
makes for happiness. When a marriage is
arranged at long distance between two high
contracting parties, one of them may have
an ant-eaten wooden leg without the other
getting previous notice of the fact. It is
said that one of the best military combina-
tions of Santa Anna, the Napoleon of
Mexico, broke down through the white ants
eating his wooden leg and bringing him to
the ground with curses and a crash, just
when he most required to be perpendicular
and keep his eye on the fortunes of the
battlefield.

MELBOURHE CHATTER.
Melbourne, July 22, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Last week some of the brainiest men in
Melbourne entertained Ambassador Bryce at
a fearfuly select dinner at the Grand Hotel.
Bryce is a British member of a certain club,
which is tersely and mysteriously described
at this end as “Round Table —Melbourne
Group.” It was this Institute of Secret
Feeders and Circular Brain Saws which was
responsible for the wine bill. The members
frown heavily when questioned, and darkly
declare that “It is Forbidden to Speak of the
Club.” Would to Heaven that all clubs had
some such regulation! Nearly all club
stories seem to be fearfully long, and mostly
relate to the arguments humorously ad-
vanced by Brown or Jones as to why he
should be allowed to leave the cards-and-
whisky seance in time to catch his second
last train. Every now and then something
very solid in the literary line falls off the
Round Table; it weighs about three hundred-
weight per page, and makes beautiful curl-
papers.
The society lace enthusiasts, who know
no gods but the Arts and Crafts, are just
now very keen on securing a wonderful piece
of stitching, which is in the possession of a
hotelkeeper at Cranbourne, on the Morning-
ton peninsula. He took it in lieu of payment
' from a lacemaker, and the lady has since
perished, taking with her into the Unknown
the secret of her beautiful work, of which only
this one specimen is known to be alive. The
experts say that it is a good example of a
cunning old English stitch which is generally
considered to be lost to the world of needle-
workers. Hence their anxiety to get hold
of the relic.
St. Hilda’s return mayoral dance, for
which the Assistant Town Clerk evolved a
fine decorative scheme in purple and gold,
was poorly attended by Toorak, although
Toorak leaped and bounded, and slid very
numerously at the initial function. But St.
Kilda loyally contributed its Best People,
of which there are quite a number. The
Atlee Hunts, the Agar Wynnes, and the,
Alawa Robertson-Buchanans added distinc-
tion to the frocking, which was a storey or
two above the average. Gyles Turner and
his dame attended. The dame is S 3 years
young, and rarely misses a big social event.
The two George Turner sisters danced briskly
in Paris gowns. They make periodical ap-
pearances on the social horizon, then dis-
appear into the simple life or go travelling
in foreign parts. By the way, the poor
Turner lady lies very ill at Hawthorn. She
has been under the eye of a trained nurse for
six months or more.
The Carmelite Ball adds a cubit to its
popularity every year. The 14tli hardy
annual happened, last Wednesday, in the
South Melbourne Town Hall, the portico of
which was snugly awninged in. The youth
of St. Kilda went along in large quantities,
and a band which knew its business twanged
and scraped sweetly amongst some apple
orchard scenery on the stage. Beautiful blue
roses- —the sort that Kipling sought for in
vain—bloomed round the electric lights, and
scarlet curtains kept the draughts from door-
ways, and made cosy nooks for sitters-out.
The old Museum of the University, outside
the windows of which the whale skeleton
used to shake itself, has been rebuilt as a
club house for the whole seat of learning.
The Government made a grant of £2OOO for
the work ; but more cash is wanted for the
furnishing expenses, and the University
people have been throwing their books aside
and hustling round to collect it. Last week,
professordom alighted from its high hobby-
horse, and allowed the Wilson Hall to be
used for a dance in aid of the cashbox. The
fact that dancing had never before shaken
the sacred cedar-beamed edifice was evident
in the rocky state of the floor —though vari-
ous energetic people had done their best to
give it a glassy finish.
The Fuller lady and Miss Phipps joined
in the dissipation; but Melba refused to
face the learned draughts again before her
concert. The ’Varsity folk present were
mostly clad in dowdiness, but some military
big guns brightened the scene with their
brilliant clothes.
Auntie Phipps, whose black locks were fixed
into a door-knocker arrangement, weighted
her small ears with gold curtain rings of the
largest size. John Madden’s dame brought
daughter Lesly, who seems to be putting on
weight. Mrs. Fred Payne, in midnight blue,
trailed a tail dusted with stars; and Mrs.
W. Clarke, wife of Tasmania’s new com-
mandant, was caparisoned in black and
pink. Those folks who declined to hop pro-
moted circulation by taking a long walk
under canvas to the refreshments.
The Mary Proctor boom is already begin-
ning, and the stargazing lady will be rushed
as a social prize the moment she touches
Melbourne. The Most Expensive People
seem disposed to take up science now that
they have lost the opera.
Mrs. Lansell, of Bendigo, besides being
one of the wealthiest of Australian women,
has another claim to attention. Her house
is one of the largest in the State, yet this
wonder of matrons has never bad occasion
to worry about servants. Some of her re-
tainers have been with her for 30 years,
and a vassal of less than 20 years’ standing
is looked upon as quite a newcomer.
Hunting spills have been fairly numerous
lately, but the most serious injury in recent
days was sustained by Mr. Hobson, one of
the leaders of the thin black line of Society.
The doctors worried considerably over his
broken ankle, and at one time his foot was
in jeopardy. However, that danger is past,
and he is convalescing well in Dr. Bird’s
private knifery, where he is being kept
cheerful with flowers, sweetly sympathetic
messages and visits by splendidly-gowned
chaperones and nice girls of the hunting set.
Miss Johnson, of Louisiana, a natty
young American damsel who is travelling
with the Cisneros couple, drives a smart
little electric coup 6 round Melbourne. It is
like a glass case on wheels with the steer-
ing gear inside. Sometimes the motorist
takes the singer as a passenger. The coupe
and a string of following traffic was stuck
up on Princes’ Bridge the other day, owing
to the lady having forgotten to re-register
her travelling glass case.
Spruce Myth is making wmekly descents
on this city now that the Federal Parlia-
ment is awake again. He is very happy over
a distinct decrease in chest measurement, the
result of a new method which he has dis-
covered. and is recommending in stage whis-
pers to other men of boundless equator.
Widow Talbot de Malaliide, of the Apple
Isle, has unpacked her duds, and hung them
round a flat in the Melbourne Mansions.
Her nerves have been anyhow since a gard-
ener of the family domain became suddenly
demented, and, obtaining a gun, forced the
terrified household to take refuge behind
locked doors. The maniac at last rushed
away* into the neighboring scrub, and put a
bullet into his own head. Mrs. Talbot had
taken her dog for a walk, and just missed
being a witness to the tragedy. She hap-
pened to return with the hound to the house
along a by-road, where the demented agri-
culturist wasn’t looking for her.
Mrs. Agar Wynne’s son, Charlie Dudgeon,
who married Miss Innes some months ago,
has had a very sick honeymoon, and the
cleverest German doctors have been treating
him with radium without very satisfactory
results. He and his devoted nurse-bride are
now in England, and Mary Wynne has gone
over from Paris to join them. This indepen-
dent young woman has quite deserted Aus-
tralia, and left both Mrs. Agar Wynne and
sister Mrs. Ledingham lamenting. The two
ladies had a prolonged discussion about the
mothering of the girl, daughterless Mrs.
Ledingham desiring to adopt her. Mary now
appears to have adopted herself.
A Brunswick maiden, Miss Eileen Hassett,
has accepted the ring of Mr. Kenneth Wil-
son, of Queensland. The fiance has a heavy-
weight Scotch uncle, Sir William Gordon-
Cumming. His relation throws a Caledonian
glamor over the engagement.
Miss Snodgrass, sister to dead Janet
Clarke, has just been installed as a sister in
the Ballarat Hospital. The lady took up
nursing late in life. She was drawn to the
healing profession by the wonders kindly
hospital white-caps worked for her, after a
tram accident in which she was severely in-
jured.
Melbourne Repertory Theatre began its
fifth season well with an excellent perform-
ance of Arnold Bennett’s “What the Public
Wants.” The audience turned up its collec-
tive collar, forgot the prevailing (atmo-
spheric) frost, and devoted itself to enjoy-
ment. Madge Mclntosh revelled in two
acts, then flew off for the third Blue Bird
episode. Statistician Knibbs, being a man
of culture as well as a slave of figures, _ was
there as a matter of course. The audience
was so large that it overflowed into the bal-
cony. As regards the frocking, the fact is
worth mentioning that Mr. Donald Alsop
changed his socks five times in the interests
of Art.
The Repertory Theatre production of
“The Seagull” drew a big house. to
the Athenaeum on Saturday night.
Motors deposited heaps of expensively-
dressed women at the foot of the
grey steps, and intellectuals, perched on
eminences, remarked complacently that Mel-
bourne is making serious efforts to improve
its mind. The mummers dressed themselves
in modern, everyday garb. It was rather
disappointing to those who had looked for-
ward to seeing Blamire Young’s crinoline
setting.
Blamire Young is holding a highly-colored
show in Sydney next month. Hardy Wilson
has found a conveniently-situated room in
George-street, near the G.P.0., and the
casual, picture-loving passer-by is expected
to fall in by the tram load.
Cisneros, who has been luring people to
the freezing chamber known as the Town
Hall, got frost-bitten herself, on Friday
night, when Mrs. Professor Peterson escorted
her to the Conservatorium concert in the
same building. So bitter was the night that
the tall singer was forced during the inter-
val to don a fur coat and fur motor boots.
If she had possessed a fur hood she would
probably have put that on, too.
Cisneros has been showing off some ex-
quisite Parisian frocks at the Town Hall. A
matin6e costume was compounded of blue
and lace, with the upholstery of a whole
ostrich woven into one fluffy scarf. The
lady considerately turned her magnificent
back and spoke to accompanist Whittle
while the gaping feminine audience admired
her black sash. On Saturday night she
prepared for a “Carmen” item by wearing a
scarlet and gold fur-edged scarf —a wonder-
fully fascinating “prop” that went effectively
with her pink and grey galah-parrot gown.
In spite of the comfortless Town Hall, her
audiences have been getting denser. The
women admirers of Paul Dufault, the golden-
voiced tenor, have been reinforced by regi-
ments of music-loving men, for Paul’s voice
is spoken of with enthusiasm in clubs and
bars, as well as shrieked about in drawing-
rooms.
Hans Heysen is rather inclined to believe
that Australians are practical art lovers.
He gathered in nearly £2OOO from his 10-
day show.
Lottie Sargent, who is Mrs. Prank Greene
off the boards, is in Melbourne again, look-
ing perked up after her serious ill-
ness. A bronchial affection which might
have been the forerunner of lung
trouble and complete loss of voice,
drove the alarmed Lottie into a long
retirement on the Blue Mountains. The
mountain air has apparently earned its fee
of gratitude.
Mollie Carew, a pretty Melbourne singing
girl who has several charity performances
against her name, is going to experiment
with a drawing-room entertainment at the
Athenaeum Hall for a week of evenings. A
committee is looking after her, and she is to
strike the first introductory chords on Mon-
day, July 29.
Mrs. Professor Peterson, who can use a
paint brush as well as a conductor’s baton,
lias been ill since beginning her portrait of
Melba, but is now making desperate efforts
to yard the busy singer, in order to get on
with the symphony in color. Melba gave her
one sitting recently, and then laughed a mis-
chievous, “With luck, you’ll get another!”
Thus other has not come to pass.
Still, the amateur paintress, by working at
high pressure, made an excellent sketch.
Bertie Wright’s fair little wife is bemoan-
ing the loss of £3OO worth of jewels, stolen
while she was lying ill on the boat coming
from Westralia. The hard part about it is
that she doesn’t need any advertisement of
the kind, not being on the stage.
One Ben Phillips described (in brackets)
as “the eminent English violinist,” gives a
recital at the Independent Hall, Collins-
street, this Thursday night. Mr. Ben’s
photo on the programme bears an indepen-
dent hall-mark, and suggests that he is re-
freshingly unlike the violinist whose soul
runs to long hair. Also, his English press
notices are promising. Miss Pauline Bindley
will assist the recitalist by singing between
times, and Miss Agnes Caples accompanies
at the large square box of music with the
short legs and the black and white teeth.
The procession of artist showmen at the
Athenaeum Gallery has brought Joseph Wol-
inski under this week’s observation. Some
pictures that he didn’t exhibit in Sydney
are included in the bill, or catalogue. The
Wolinski works were to take the wall on
Wednesday, and will hang until the last day
of the month.
Last week Melba motored from Cold-
stream to Ballarat, stayed in the statue city
long enough for a hurried meal, and then
petrolled on to Ercildoune, the Samuel Wil-
son place she knows so well. At Ercildoune
she prepared for a Ballarat concert, to which
the whole country-side loyally streamed.
Eleonora de Cisneros gives the information
that she is engaged for the Verdi centenary,
to be held at Parma, in Northern Italy, next
year. There is to be a grand round of Verdi
operas by “all the talents.” Verdi —who is
dead now, and can’t contradict—was born at
the village of Roncole, which is reached by
a brief steam-tram ride from Parma. His
father kept a small pub, and whistled for cus-
tom, which, I learn on the worst authority,
was how Verdi, jun., came to be a great
musician.
Prom my Adelaide correspondent:—
Mayor Bonython’s Fancy Dress Ball for Children
wound up the Denman week. About a thousand
elaborately disguised infants revelled amid the
•lap., decorations that had edified their elders the
previous Wednesday. Mrs. Parsons (in white ninon-
veiled satin, with touches of black) and the Mayor
received their small guests, and Lady Denman garbed
her slim form in black, attached a number of dia-
monds to herself, and came to look on.
The only thing which really matters is being col-
lected for Mrs. Macnamara, whose son was killed by
a motor-trolly last week. Carrie Moore sang lustily
in the public streets on behalf of the cause, and so
amassed some £B5. Gawler Place, where "young
Macnamara was killed, is a death-trap, and it should
be wiped off the face of the earth, or thrown over-
board, or ploughed up and sown with salt, or
otherwise scorned and refected.
Mrs. Harry Ayers gave a ball at Demira, East
Terrace, to celebrate the marriage of her elder son
to Miss Edna Kidman. There were about 200 guests
and no complaints. Daffodil and white stock
banked the mantel-pieces in the ballroom, and a
huge marquee, with red as its color note, made an
excellent supper-room.
The big college football match of the year trans-
pired at the Adelaide oval on Saturday afternoon.
Some peace crank or other conceived the plan of
dividing the Reds and Blues into sheep and goats as
it were. In vain they raged. The partisan feeling
which in the past has led to free fights and such,
was unable to find expression in physical violence,
and the hearts of many were the heavier for it.
By the way, there was a good deal of loval furv
in scholastic circles when the news leaked out that
the cadets’ review was going to clash with the Col-
lege match. Several maddened dominies and others
went so far as to suggest that Lord Denman’s in-
spection of the junior military forces should be
deferred. However, in the end both functions even-
tuated and all was well. Saint Peter’s and Prince
Alfred’s Old Scholars held their annual dinners this
week, and the only blood spilled was that of the
grape.
From a recent daily: “Lady, domesticated, would
like position of trust as manageress or housekeeper
to gentleman or widower. Reply Carissima.” I
understand that there was an absolute rush on this
offer. Housekeepers with names like “Carissima”
are deplorably rare these Chapzanderish times.
Apropos the lady who fell through the floor of the
Royal Oak Hotel the other day, and was killed, it is
now alleged that Adelaide is full of similar death-traps
Heaven alone knows the effect the revelation will have
on the Marianne problem; but I should think it
would be pernicious to a degree. The Australian girl
is sufficiently shy of becoming a cook already (the
Royal Oak victim was a cook, by the way, and she
fell, even as a soldier does, while in the execution of
her duty) ; but if, superimposed upon its other dis-
abilities, the local kitchen is to be revealed as some-
thing parlously like unto a medieval oubliette, the
chances are that food-raining by females will shortly
be numbered among S.A.’s lost arts.
Talking of accidents, Superintendent Owen Smyth
collided with a cyclist in North Adelaide on Tues-
day, and was so seriously damaged that he had to
be removed to the North Adelaide Hospital.
The Otranto brought back to us K. C. Grundy and
his wife, who have put in some months in Europe.
A. W. Dobbie, who died the other day, was an un-
usual sort of business man. His means of support
was an electro-plating, etc., establishment which he
ran in Gawler Place. In his leisure moments he was
an inventor. He rigged for himself a telephone long
before the infuriating contraption was taken up by
any Australian Government. Also, he was a hypno-
tist. He allayed pain and cured dipsomaniacs, and
more than once helped patients through operations
when anesthetics were impossible.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

« ■
Indigestion Caused this Woman Untold
Misery till Cured by Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills.
"Some days I felt so hungry, but dare not
eat,” said Mrs. Robert Strike, 14 Bruce
Street, Kensington. Melbourne, describing
the way she suffered from indigestion. Mrs.
Strike tried many remedies and failed to get
relief, and at last became very weak and ill.
She finally tried Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
and was cured. These nills are a natural
cure for all forms of indigestion, because
their tonic action strengthens ‘’nd corrects
the digestive organs. They have no purga-
tive action to weaken the stomach. Mrs.
Strike made the following statement to a
reporter: — .
“I used to have attacks of indigestion oh
and on, and four years ago I got a dreadful
attack. Every scrap of food began to
disagree directly it had been swallowed, and
lay on my chest causing a suffocating feel-
ing. The breast-bone felt sore and tender. I
could hardly get my breath, and I ached all
over. Some days I felt so hungry, but I
dare not eat much. For more than a week I
did not take a morsel of bread; only milk
foods, and even then I would retch. For a
day or so I would be in bed, then perhaps up
and about the next day, and then laid up
again. It was misery. I could hardly hold
up against the hpadaches; always a dull,
throbbing pain, with shooting attacks as
well. I got thinner and thinner and turned
very sallow. At last my husband brought
home a box of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pdls.
The first few doses made me feel worse, but
presently such a change set in. I became
hungry, and, before the box was empty, 1
was just craving for meal time. I could
hardly credit it, for the pains in my chest
eased off, and so did all the sickness and
headaches. I began to fill out again wonder-
fully and to get my color back. I have not
had a trace of indigestion since.” .
The price of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pdls is
2/9 per box, six boxes 15/3, and if you have
trouble in getting them send a postal note
for the amount to the Dr. Williams Medi-
cine Co. of Australasia, Ltd., Sydney, and
they will be sent post free by return mail.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Howl of Discord from Grant Hervey : ,
Warrnambool (Vic.) has held its annual Farmers
Conference. The only subject of real -national utility
dealt with was the question of the bulk-
handling of grain. The executive said that
“expert opinion” was against this system, and
turned it down. It transpired that the said
“opinion” had been obtained by asking the big
dealers, traders, bag-sellers and middlemen what they
thought about the bulk-handling proposal. And
these persons did a big, big think, and decided that
the good old bag system (with its middlemen s
profits) was leagues ahead of the elevator plan,
which makes the bag superfluous, and that innova-
tion should be resisted with one unanimous tence-
rail. On this kind of evidence the farmers con-
vention threw out the bulk-wheat idea, and resumed
the endless discussion on the stinkwort, or weeds to
that effect. Contemplation of many scores of these
conferences and conventions drops this conclusion
like a dead cat upon the doormat of the mind, viz.,
that Victoria is the stupidest State in Australia.
It holds more conventions, gatherings and similar
jamborees to the square mile than any other two
States in the Commonwealth. Farmers conventions,
AN.A. conferences, P.L.C. eruptions, Anglican
synods, Decentralisation conferences, South-street
competitions, anti-tom-cat hurrahs the Niagara
of vocabulary never ceases. Yet the State, as a
whole, doesn’t progress so that you can t witness
its heels for dust. I have lately been fleeing through
the principal farming towns and mining villages m
Victoria, including Ballarat, Bendigo, Warrnambool,
Portland, Horsham, Maryborough, Stawell, Ararat,
Hamilton, etc., and I have not seen one town that is
breaking its neck in the race to be in the van of the
procession.
PROPPING THE RICK.—A STORMY
DAY.
After a new picture at Sydney Art Gallery.
South Australia is not troubled much by
sectarianism, but there was an “Orange
rally” in Adelaide last week, and one ot the
speakers made a lovely “bull.” The memory
of Derry and the Boyne, said this supporter
of the Yellow Pup, must be “kept green'
just as one might pull the leg of the sham-
rock or cast the lake of Killarney to the
four winds.
Italy has abolished capital punishment,
but it is often better to be dead than alive
in a Dago gaol. One recent sentence on a
homicide included, as a mere side issue, ten
years solitary confinement in a dark cell
64ft. each way—a walk in a courtyard once
a" month being the only recreation. Some
other recent sentences ran as high as 30
years “solitary.” The tender mercies of the
Peanut are cruel.
An interesting correspondence, showing
the shifts that Freetrade puts the manufac-
turer to, drifted into this office the other
day—a copy of a letter just received by a
German manufacturer who was asked to
join a British manufacturing association so
that British prices might be regulated. As
a bait to the German to come in and not
undercut the Briton in the latter’s own
market, it is remarked that “if the prices
in England can be held up to a higher level,
the probability is that you and other Con-
tinental makers will be able to obtain
higher prices in the overseas market than
you would otherwise be able to get.” Which
is very cheerful to Australia, this country
being 'part of the overseas pigeon which is
to be plucked.
Really, Sydney Telegraph doth protest
too much in regard to the villainy of Speaker
Willis. Its chief howl, last week, was due
to the fact that Willis prevented Oakes, ex-
M.L.A., from trespassing in those parts of
the House that are reserved for members
only. The Telegraph took the point that
there was an “unwritten law” permitting
ex-members to break the written laws
of the House, and that Oakes had
every right to frequent the Assembly
-—just as a man who has been kicked
out of a club is notoriously at liberty
to pervade it as of yore. The standpoint of
Willis was that if all the myriads of defeated
members were put “on the door” at Mac-
quarie-street, chaos would supervene. How-
ever, the Telegraph reckons that this is the
view of a malignant and cowardly Hound,
and that Willis will yet drown himself
beneath the piled-up debris of his own crim-
inal arbitrariness and venom.
A few remarks from “Horse Outcast” :
If at any time an inquiry is started in Egypt or
Bokhara, as to whether the bookmaker or the Tote
is the better institution, it will, I hope, be remem-
bered that the dice are always liable to be loaded,
and the race is always liable to be stiff. The Tartar
bookmaker has money for purposes of persuasion,
and the Tote hasn’t, especially in Greece. The
Patagonian bookmaker is live and approachable meat,
while the Tote, both in Honolulu and elsewhere, is
dead and cold and silent and unresponsive machinery.
The bookie asks you cheerfully to have a drink in
Palestine, while the Tote doesn’t even invite you to
have a snowball on the equator. The question
arises whether the Tote shouldn’t get at least 50yds.
advantage in 100, or receive 334 per cent, discount
when the question arises in Abyssinia or elsewhere.
All the world’s experience, especially around the
Upper Nile, suggests that when cold honesty races
against a huge, hot, fat fraud, and a big bag, and
a hooked nose and a hooked Moses, 50vds. in 100
are about as little as anybody could ask for, particu-
larly on rough ground such as you find in Alaska.
How about enacting that, when the next Tote Com-
mission happens at Timbuctoo or Greenland, a 40 per
cent, vote will be held sufficient to carry the case
for the machine which has no money to scatter, and
no champagne or cigars to offer f That will mean
the disqualification of 31 per cent, of the pro-Bag
vote as suspicious. It doesn’t seem too much, especi-
ally in a place like Turkey, where corruption is
notorious.
The Land, the organlet of the N.S.W.
Farmers and Settlers’ Association, pro-
claimed menacingly a few days back that
the Assoc, was “a power which would un-
doubtedly bend or break any
Government.” Well, let’s
see. Patten (president),
Trethowan (vice-president),
Campbell (secretary), John
Perry, Grogan and others
have been run politically by
the Association. With the
exception of Perry, they all
went down. Perry managed
to get into the Assembly for
one term, and then was fired
out. Last election he
squeezed in for Liverpool
Plains, then, with an upset
election, fell out a few days
after. So far, a couple of
M’s.L.C. appointed by the
Wade crowd is all the poli-
tical power the Association
can boast of. Before it starts
“breaking or bending Gov-
ernments,” it would be as
well if the Farmers and Set-
tlers elected at least one man
to Parliament, and kept
him there long enough to
get the devastation going.
Attorney-General Holman (N.S.W.) pro-
poses to “proceed at law” against certain
witnesses who refused to answer questions
put to them by the royal commission on Food
Supply. In other words, another elephant
is to be employed to crack a peanut, and as
the peanut is small and elusive it will pro-
bably take him several months to do the
job, during which time his food bill will
mount up wonderfully. Heaven only knows
how much has been already eaten by the ele-
phant which is struggling with the Sugar
Commission peanut, and though he has
whisked round for several weeks he hasn’t
got his foot on the article yet.
From Melb. Argus last week: “These
women’s combinations are the mainstay or
the Liberal party.” No, it wasn t a dress
item. It figured in a sub-leadei, weirdly
enough.
A Sydney daily paper brevity:—
Mr. McGowen yesterday soothed a deputatioii of
boilermakers by saying he thought he could arrange
that no men would be imported until local men had
got jobs.
And how about arranging that no boilers
shall be imported till the local men have got
jobs?
Between 1906 and 1912 the number ot
electors on the N.S.W. roll increased by
260,352—the increase in Sydney and suburbs
being 153,145, and in all the rest of the great
State of N.S.W. a mere 107,207. If decen-
tralisation gets on with such reckless haste
as this it will fall over its own feet one ot
these days, and break its neck through drop-
ping on its head.
Foreign news item :
The Italian Government has informed the Powers
unofficially that it is ready and anxious to end the
Tripolitan campaign.
Also, the trespasser who is up a tree with a
fierce and toothy dog sitting at the bottom
has intimated unofficially 7 that he is willing
to close the campaign on his own terms if
the dog is willing.
It may be true, as some Tories allege, that
the Asiatic peril is a myth, and that Shem
doesn’t want Australia on any account. It
may be true, but when about 30 Shems are
willing, as was proved last week, to make a
horrible trip hidden in the coal-bunkers of a
steamer, just for the bare and skeletony
chance of getting into the Promised Land, it
looks as if Shem wanted Australia something
awful. In fact, it looks as if he wanted it
so badly that he. is likely to fight for it
like the very Devil as soon as he thinks there
is the faintest chance of getting it.
The section of Wadeism, or Deform, or
Liberalism, or whatever it is, which recently
selected Captain F. Dunn to carry its ban-
ner in King (Sydney), has coldly turned the
ancient mariner down, and chosen H. E.
Manning in his stead. The Dunnites are
understood to be furious. Manning is a
rising junior, and a son of W. P. Manning,
ex-Mayor of Sydney. His triumph over the
infuriated Dunn is said to be a manifesta-
tion, amongst other things, of Liberalism’s
intention to pursue the erstwhile neglected
R.C. vote at next elections.
THE COMMONWEALTH TARIFF .
FOREIGN IMPORTER : “Call this an obstacle!
Why, it's invigorating!”
The new “time limit of speeches” standing
order, which is before the Australian Parlia-
ment at the hour of writing, has too many
exceptions, provisos and hesitations to be of
much account. It proposes to limit ordinary
members’ remarks to one hour, except in
debates on the utterly useless Address-in-
Iteply, and the almost equally futile no-
confidence motion. In these cases, and on
Appropriation Bills, the limit is 90 minutes
-—6 O minutes too long. In committee no one
must speak for more than 15 minutes or
more than four times on any question—mem-
bers in charge of a Bill and Ministers ex-
cepted. And even these embargoes on pur-
poseless blither may be suspended if the
House decides, by an ordinary majority, not
to turn off the tap of oratory with a jerk
and slay the gasometer in his youth.
The press of the big cities makes heroic
efforts to say something kind now and then
about the decentralisation idea without com-
mitting itself —like an impassioned political
female in Victoria, who once declared herself
unreservedly in favor of breaking up the big
estates in the Western District so long as the
present possessors weren’t “disturbed in their
beautiful homes.” Thus the financial man
of Sydney Telegraph blazed forth in a
recent issue:—
The cry for decentralisation is always cropping up,
and all Ministers lend it a sympathetic hearing, and
then do nothing. In the Farmers’ Parliament yesterday
objection was taken to the report of the late Royal
Commission, which confined itself to Port Stephens
on the north, and perhaps to Jervis Bay on the south.
But that Royal Commission was not given the option
of stating whether it believed in decentralisation or
not. It was told to name the best ports for the
purpose, and did so. Still, whatever happens, the
central markets are bound to remain in Sydney, and
the oversea shipping will centre here likewise. The
northern and southern ports are certainly needed for
the coastal trade.
In other words, the Telegraph man believes
in opening up the neglected deep sea ports
so long as the deep sea ships don’t go to
them, and they are merely visited bv little
coasters which will carry their produce to
Sydney. If Britain had followed that idea
there would have been no Liverpool or
Cardiff or Glasgow or Leith or Hull or
Southampton or any one of a dozen other
norts. In fact, there wouldn’t have been
much Britain.
THE KITE THAT FAILED.
“8.J.”: At the recent 12th of July out-
burst in Melbourne a motion was carried
urging the Orangemen of Ulster to rise in
insurrection, treason and blanky murder in
the event of the passage of the Home Rule
Bill, and promising them the moral and “if
necessary material support” of Australian
yellow pupdom. This meeting, at which re-
bellion and civil war were openly advo-
cated, was presided over by a member of
Parliament (Robinson Snowball, M.L.A.)
who has taken an oath of loyalty to the
King and the law. Labor agitators have
been gaoled for less, and Findley was ex-
pelled from the Victorian Parliament for an
alleged offence that was not worth mention-
ing by comparison. How does it come to
pass that Orangemen are allowed to commit
with impunity offences that are punishable
by hanging or lifelong imprisonment? I
suppose treason is still an offence.
THE CALL OF COHEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Labor party would have to borrow in the end.
It was ridiculous to say that there should be no bor-
rowing. A man who refused to borrow when it
would pay him was a fool.
— Mr. Harper, on Australian finance.
They needs must borrow in the end,
It is the only way.
The good the gods of Judah send
Can paint the landscape gay;
On this our longing souls depend
To make Australia pay.
Vain is our hope to stand alone,
Too faint our hearts and few.
Although some seed our hands have sown
To ready harvest grew,
It had been better had it known
The blessing of the Jew.
As sure as daylight follows dawn,
As sure as beer is wet,
All things of worth are always drawn
By Israel’s gentle net;
And while we still have things to pawn
We ought to keep in debt.
Our land must borrow in the end,
It is the only way ;
Though we have cash enough to spend
It does not keep us gay,
Unless on Judah we depend
To make Australia pay.

GEORGE BARR McCUTCHEON’S BOOKS
have been the talk of the world’s literary circles for many years, but their prohibi-
tive prices have made them luxuries to be indulged in sparingly. Now, however,
our Australian readers are about to have a unique opportunity of sampling some
of them, as the N.S.W. Bookstall Co., Ltd., have arranged with the American
publishers to bring out
Cheap Editions at Sixpence
per copy. The first two books in this series, now ready, are :
“Truxton King” and “The Man from Brodney’s.”
Post Free 7d. each.
These books, which have been reprinted in Sydney, have all the freshness of
new type first editions, and constitute a record in local publishing, being the
cheapest productions of standard authors ever known beyond England or America.
“The Butterfly Man” and “The Alternative.”
By George Barr McCutcbeon.
Price 1/- Post Free 1/1.
Here we have two books for the price of one, and both are equally good. “The
Butterfly Man,” indeed, ranks amongst one of the cleverest things of its kind, and
enhanced this au hor’s reputation materially.
Essentially a book for young men, sisters and mothers, this work draws such a
pen picture of a selfish society butterfly that most people will at once exclaim,
“Just like young So-and-so.” . . , . ,
The young man’s awakening is swift, severe and uncompromising ; Ins down-
fall complete, and the conclusion of the story just as everyone hoped for.
“THE ALTERNATIVE” is a delightful story in MeCutcheon’s best style, and
must be read to be appreciated.
“What’s-His-Name?
II
By George Barr McCutcheon.
Price 1/- Post Free 1/1.
By arrangement with the American publishers, Dodd, Mead & Co., of New
York, the N.S.W. Bookstall Co., Ltd., are able to put this famous author’s expensive
book on the Australian market at the low price of one shilling, and those who are
not conversant with the great American’s work should lose no time in reading
“What’s-llis-Name?”
This is a charming story of a man who was always known as “What s-His-
Name? You know, Nellie Duluth’s husband.”
Nellie was a favorite actress, whose profession permitted her no time to attend
to her home, with the results related in the book. An exceptionally interesting
story, with a surprising finish of great power.

THE DANGER OF WORMS.
Stomach and Intestinal Worms are one
of the most common complaints throughout
Australasia. Indigestion is a primary
cause, or they may be produced by Consti-
pation, or through the eating of tainted food
or food improperly cooked. There _is also
the possibility of their introduction into the
system in the form of cysts or germs in fruit
and meat, so that all classes of the com-
munity, irrespective of age, are liable to this
complaint. It is not alone the irritation
and i annoyance caused by these parasitical
animals that infest the stomach and bowels,
but the more serious consequences which
follow that must be kept in view. From the
highly organised and sensitive parts which
they occupy, Worms give rise to great con-
stitutional derangements, and produce a
variety of symptoms, more particularly
affecting the stomach and head. Many
cases of Convulsions. Epilepsy, Hysteria.
St. Vitus’ Dance, Melancholia, Nervous
Diseases, and even Insanity have resulted
from this cause. If the patient has a ten-
dency to any weakness, the neglect to eradi-
cate the worms from the system must in-
evitably cause the emaciation of the whole
body and a general breakdown of the whole
organism. _ „
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable preparation for the
eradication of Worms in children and adults.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The literature of the Great Cricket Dis-
oute still pours in. First of all, the Victorian
Cricket Association issued a lucid, terse account of
the history of the dispute from “the earliest times
to the present day,” showing how Anglo-Australian
cricket became a commercial enterprise, run by a
band of old-time boodlers, who fleeced new members
unmercifully. The history of the formation of the
Board of Control, for the express purpose of putting
down this boodling, and placing the game, after
cleansing and disinfecting it, on a sound basis, is
briefly recounted, and the struggles of the boodlers
and their friends to overthrow the Board are set out
in interesting array. To this crushing indictment
Frank Laver replied with a pamphlet which dismissed
all the events before the departure of the 1909 XI
as “ancient history, true or otherwise,” and explained
to a grinning public that “the actual cause of the
present cricket trouble has been the attempt primarily
and principally by Mr. McElhone to humiliate and
ignore the leading cricketers.” After that, eight and
a half pages tell what a pure, disinterested, innocent,
lamb-like individual Mr. Laver proved to be while
managing the 1909 team, and how (sniff!) lie pre-
sented Peter McAlister with an album of photos, of
his (Laver’s) own taking, bearing a complimentary
legend. He forgot to mention that the XI allowed
him a sum of money to bear the cost of producing
those photos.—somewhere about £50 —and he
omitted to state whether they were cheap “gaslights”
or high-class carbon or salted-paper prints. One
can print a lot of “gaslighters” or “P.0.P.” for £5O,
and still have enough to buy a few albums. It’s a
paltry business, and a lurid commentary on the
strength of argument that Mr. Laver has, when he
has to quote such a puerile incident as an evidence
of integrity on his side and malignant hatred on
Mr. McAlister’s. McAlister, by the way, in his reply
to Laver’s pamphlet, states that he returned Laver’s
gift, and paid cash for one which he bought from
the common stock. The trouble about Mr. Laver’s
pamphlet, on the face of it, is that it is special
pleading, and special pleading of the sort calculated
to take in only gentry of the type of the Westralian
whose letter is quoted above. One of the curious
items in it is the cheerful denunciation of Mr.
McElhone for not supplying the team with sufficient
money, and the telling as a humorous joke, that
when at last money did come to hand, it was sent out
of his own private purse by this McElhone because he
wanted to humiliate the Players. So this astute,
cunning, deep-scheming old McElhone forwarded
money out of his own private pocket, while the
Board was temporarily without funds, to save Mr.
Laver from inconvenience; and that is how McElhone
humiliated Laver’s crowd. A humorous tale, truly!
As hinted by Carlyle, a large proportion
of the Community is fool. So there are still, amaz-
ing as it may seem, people who believe in the “Sorry
Six,” and one of these curious survivals sends the
following delightful tit-bit: —
“The Sporting Editor. Sir, —I am addressing you
as the Sporting Editor, although I am quite satisfied
there is not much of the real sport about you, the
way you try to write up the so-called Australian
cricketers now in England proves that, no man that
knows anything about cricket, could call them an
Australian eleven, they are not even second raters,
the few matches they have won, were against fifth to
tenth raters, Tasmania could wallop your Australian
team with ease. Also Sydney could pick a couple
of teams that could sweep the ground with them any
day. From what I can learn there is a man in
Sydney named Makalone or something, who calls
himself the board of controle, now I would like to
know who elected Makalone as the baord, I am cer-
tain Australia never did, the sooner Australia gets
rid of this one man baoird of controle, the better it
will be for Australian cricket, also the sooner you
write your snorting notions from an Australians
noint of view," the better it will be for your page,
is Mack oiling your palm, or is he shouting you
long beers, or what? To wind up with if your scab
team wins one test match against England I will
stand you a gallon of stale beer.—Yours, etc.,
(signed) James Muunek. W.A. 7/7/’12.”
These be your champions, O Sorry Six!
The second meeting between Australia and
S’Afriea was the fifth match of the triangular series.
It took place at Lord’s, under unusual English con-
ditions of fine weather and a fast, true wicket. The
previous meeting, at Manchester, saw Australia win
in a couple of days, by an innings and 88 runs. Since
then England has twice defeated S’Africa and drawn
with Australia, so this match was Africa’s last hope.
Sydney Gregory lost the toss for the 15th time on
English soil in 19 calls. Africa went to the wickets
and was dismissed for 263, including 29 sundries.
Whitty bagged four for 68, Hazlitt two for 47, and
Minnett two for 49. Matthews got one for 32 and
Kelleway one for 38. Gregory again sent in his best
men to start an innings towards the end of the day,
after heavy graft in the field. Nourse opened, and
got one for 0. The second wicket fell for 14. It
was not till next day that the third wicket fell for
256, and the partnership of 242 is a record for the
third wicket. Not many more were wanted, but the
team slogged away till 390 appeared on the board,
30 of which were sundries. Pegler’s four wickets
cost 79. Nourse captured a big trio for 60. Lle-
wellyn got a brace for 71, and Faulkner’s orphan
cost 86. With 127 required to avoid a one-innings’
defeat, Africa went in once more, and slogged like
the Devil, and with great violence. It got 173, in-
cluding 13 sundries. Australia, with only 47 to get
to win, acquired 48 without loss. So it struck dead
Africa’s last hope, and the triangular contest comes
down to the same old struggle between England and
Australia, with two matches yet to come.
The announcement that Warner will not
play cricket again this season probably conceals
between the lines the fact that he will not play in
any more first-class fixtures. Certainly, not in inter-
nationals. His action in risking a recurrence of the
internal trouble which played Old Sulphur with him
in Sydney, so recently, was the subject of much sur-
prise locally. Either Warner was ignorant of his
case, or burning with that enthusiasm which con-
sumes horse sense.
* * * *
Saturday in Sydney was an ideal day for
football. It was cold, dry, but not too hard after
the recent rains—conditions under which the prophets
should have flourished. But they did not have the
luck they expected. In the Rugby League section
all expectations were upset by the overthrow of New-
town by South Sydney. This is regarded as an
amazing interposition of Providence. The history of
war, football, and all other phases of violence teems
with examples of the arrival of the unexpected, the
improbable,' the absolutely impossible and so forth,
and as everybody knows that when the impossible
lannens it is due to the direct act of Providence, it
yill be seen that the failure of Newtown on Saturday
s nothing to get excited about. For a while the
two teams seemed evenly balanced, despite the fact
that South Sydney was weakened by the loss of
sundry crack players. Then an aggressive half-back
began to do things for South. His efforts were ably
backed up by the machine behind him. The for-
wards set their teeth —either their own or the ones
they had bought in the shop—and bogged in, and
what between the fury of the forwards and the
scientific deadliness of the backs, Newtown was un-
done, going under by 13 points to 20. However, the
prophets had an easy • thing in the game between
Eastern and Western Suburbs, which represent the
head and the tail of the League Competition respec-
tively Nobody expected Western Suburbs team to
make a showing against the champion crowd, and it
didn’t, the scores being 41 to 9. Balmain and
Annandale waged a stubborn and varying scrap, out
of which Balmain scrambled with 10 points to
Annandale’s eight. North Sydney journeyed to Glebe,
and for a while looked as though it would dance on
the home team. In fact, right through the first half
it was top dog. Then, suddenly, its boiler burst ;
and Glebe fell upon it, got it down, and chewed it
up by 28 points to three. Even when it was top dog
North lacked the extra half-pound weight, or some-
thing, necessary to pile up a score. Which, boiled
down, means simply that the Glebe mob had a
bigger reserve of power.
The result is that Eastern Suburbs still leads in
the competition—thanks to the mighty boot of Mes-
senger. One can’t help thinking how a really up-to-
date rival, determined to wrest the honors from
Eastern Suburbs, would drug the mighty Messenger
and inoculate him with the virus of bun-ons. No
man with bunions ever kicked the ball trom Dan to
Beersheba. However, to come back to business,
Eastern Suburbs leads the competition with 16 points,
representing eight victories, one defeat and no drawn
games. Glebe has 14, and Newtown and South Syd-
ney 12 each. Below these, single figures, the owners
of 'which, at this stage, are quite out of the hunt.
The Sydney Rugby Union is feeling good.
Attendances are growing, and the old men go to the
Union matches and sit, smoke and swear over the
deeds of other days. The old men like to dwell on
the touch-line play. In their days of derring-do they
used the touch-line for all it was worth, and
they love to recall the hour when the Bandicoots
beat the Kangaroos, in spite of the disadvantage in
weight and speed, by judicious use of the touch-lme,
working down it by kicking-out till the goal was
within range, whereupon the Messenger of the day was
let loose, and potted 16 goals in 32 minutes. But
this is a digression! The match of the day was that
between Western Suburbs, one of the crack teams ot
the division, and Newtown, also one of the top
notchers. And great was the clash thereof—a bright,
scintillating struggle full of infinite possibilities, in
which Fate’s decree was discreetly veiled in every
particular tussle till the last uttermost moment.
Several times West was on the point of making a
score, when Newtown, with a desperate effort, hauled
the chestnuts out of the fire by timely forcing. It
was a battle in which the defeated team showed no
sign of demoralisation, and struggled gamely and
intelligently to the dead finish. But the splendid
combination, the concerted movement that comes of
long, assiduous training and much active play
together, were on the side of the lighter Westein
team, and though it won by only nine to six, the
disparity between the play of the teams was very
wide indeed. Glebe crushed Manly by 21 ponits to
three. Eastern Suburbs made a holy show of North
Sydney by 19 points to nine. And St. George beat
Balmain, after a strenuous dust-up, by 11 points to
eight. University and South Sydney had byes in
their respective divisions. So m the A division Uni-
versity is on top with 19 points, and Glebe and
Eastern Suburbs are just within easy. striking dis-
tance with 17 each. In the B division Westein
Suburbs leads with 18 points, and Newtown aud
St. George have 16 and 12 respectively. Here endeth
the chronicles of the Union. #
The roving band of Tasmanian Soccer
footballers has been unlucky; going down in Mel-
bourne bv eight to one, and then coming on to Syd-
ney to be overwhelmed by 11 to nil-which is anni-
hilation in Soccer. Tasmania has only known
Soccer a few years, and, in consequence, has had no
time to develop a number of crack clubs, capable of
supplving a formidable representative team or two,
fit to'be hurled against the hardened veterans of the
Ma State, which was strong enough in 1905 to smash
up a Maoriland crowd by six goals to four. A some-
what unrepresentative lot went from Sydney to
Hobart last year, and beat the home crowd by five
goals to three. The Tassies, thinking they had im-
proved in the interim, came away fully convinced
that they had more than Buckley s chance, and
pranced cheerfully to their doom. It was like doing
a two-step to the gallows. In the desperate struggle
between Corrimal and Garden Island, m the Gardiner
Cup division, which preceded the inter-State match,
the visitors had a first-class exposition of how the
game should be played. These teams were so dead
level that the game ended in a draw with two goals
each. „ »
* * *
Saturday’s League hoofball, in this writer s
opinion, forecasted the final contests, as far as the
placed teams are concerned. South met Essendon
on the sodden East Melbourne ground, and the lat-
ter’s men, being less weighty and at home, should
have come out on top. But though they kept there
up to lemon-time, the Red-and-White s outstayed
them, and won by two goals—9.lo to Don s 7.10.
The muddy ground forbade all hope of fast, open
play but whatever science was shown was displayed
by’South; in fact, that team has at present by far
the best system of any League team, and, notwith-
standing its weight, keeps up a wonderful speed for
the full two hours. If it doesn t go off before the
middle of September it should snatch the seasons
honors. The ’Dons were certainly handicapped by
the loss of two of their best men —one permanently
—but that may happen to any team any day ; and,
anyhow, two men don’t make a team. At Victoria
Park the Magpies encountered Carlton, and a vigorous
collision ensued, which would have ended in the
locals’ favor had they possessed a couple of forwards
worthy the name (the best had been suspended for
two weeks for handing a Saint a black eye in a
recent match). Time after time the reliable half-
backs would send the ball on, only to see it fumbled
and lost by feckless forwards, who, when they did
get it, shot wide of the posts 14 times out of 17.
The Old Blues, on the other hand, kept two. small,
but efficient, kickists wandering around ’Wood’s goal
on their lonesome, and the latter’s captain hadn t
nous enough to tell off a couple of men with strict
orders to “mind” them. Consequently, Carltons
tally was eight goals seven behinds, and ’Wood s
three goals 14 behinds —23 points’ difference —and
unless some dreadful things happen to Geelong and
Melbourne, ’Wood’s chance of reaching the finals is
now less than zero. Melbourne, on its own ground,
retrieved its position somewhat by downing Geelong
by 54 points to 43; ’Roy spiflicated Richmond by
70 to 29, and Saints pulverised the Students by 102
to 50. # # 9
In the Association the variable ’Scray 16
collided with Brunswick, and anticipated a grim
struggle, but found ’Wick off-color. Even had it
been fit and well, ’Scray’s great goal kicking was a
thing to dishearten any opponent—l 4 goals three
behinds being its score —while ’Wick could only
scrape together three goals eight behinds. This
writer lives in the hope of some day seein^ ;] a
kicking 20 goals net, while its opponents toilsomely
accumulate about 100 behinds; thra 1 wi
on the powers that manage clubs that P there
the thing aimed at, and that without^ striving there
is precious little in the game for any y-■
Northcote, Port flung away its last chance by snatc
ing only 27 points to the locals’ 49. North got a
mild shock on finding that a corriparative y weak
team could barely hold its own agamst Brighton
though it ultimately “got there M
to 47. ’Town beat P’ran by / 8 to 62. AlbO. Essc
don piled up the mountainous score of 25 goals 22
behinds—l 72 points—against Melb. c^ys 31 - 9*
these 25 goals, 18 were kicked by an ex-St. Kilda
star, and the feat constitutes a record , but consider
ing the awfulness of Melb. City and other matt ,
the record is -not one to go dotty over. That same
’Don goal-kicker, with one of his mates and
’Town ’bailers, came into undue prominence during
the week through their forgiving spirit and Chris-
tian forbearance. After the Don- Town game
of a fortnight previous, these boggers-in col-
lided, and “stoush” was thrown about like
dead leaves. As a result, the matter was re-
ported to the Ass., and no less than six charges of
assault and battery were laid before the Law. Before
the charges were heard, the aforesaid Christian spin
got to work with vim, the whole of the cases were
withdrawn, and the Ass. hastily pulled a heavy veil
of silence over the entire circumstance, thus is tne
game purified and the moral standard of tne stoush
artists uplifted. But the gate-paying sniffs.
They are talking of a footballers’ insur-
ance fund in Melbourne, with a lavish scale of com-
pensations for the various ills which are the muddied
oaf’s inheritance. The trials and tribulations o
umpires are not considered. The idea is said to be
very popular among players. The Bulletin doesn t
doubt it. To a really sensitive soul, one ot the dis-
tressing features of the game, as she is played in
Melbourne, is the knowledge that the rival whom he
is about to kick out may be laid up for a month
with no visible means of support. Given an adequate
system of insurance, and every ’bailer may play on
the man with an easy conscience.

The Yic. Racing Club committee will be
on its defence at next meeting. A bag of thousands
was “blewed” on a new grandstand at Hemington,
and the building stood on a foundation of sand,
which proved unequal to its support. Had the founda-
tion been less preposterous, the precious and almighty
structure might have stood till Derby Day, and then
its collapse would have put a good few families into
mourning. A serious loss of life was luckily avoided,
but the shocking loss of cash must be made good
somehow, so the committee has notified its con-
stituents of the policy in view. It proposes to add
a guinea a year to members’ subscriptions, and
to raise the’ prices of non-members’ admission to
Stand and Hill from 10s. 6d. to 11s. 6d and from
2s. 6d. to 3s. And all because its architect planned
a palatial structure on an unsubstantial pair of sandy
feet. The members, of course, will kick hardest
against the proposed increase of the subscription.
The outside people have no voice in the matter. I hey
have to pay to go in every time. If the extra shilling
and extra sixpence make no difference to the attend-
ance, the tariff will never be put back to what it
was, whereas the members will take care that tne
subscription is reduced to its original figure as soon
as finances are straightened. That’s the advantage ol
being in a position to kick the hand that touches
your pocket. #
Soutli Australia, which does its racing in
a moderate fashion, and has no pony, or trotting, or
proprietary meetings, finished its year’s programme
on July 13, and the statistics are available. Winning
sires: Pistol, St. Alwyne, Aryan, Wallace, Pygmalion
and Isinglass. Jockeys: Liddle (out by himself),
then Marshall and Hopwood. Bax, who led last year,
was “nowhere.’’ Trainers: Howie, Whelan, J. James
(top last year) and Keily. Mr. James, however,
easilv heads the list of winning owners, with R. M.
Hawker second ; and, after the Victorians, Clarke
and Eccles (who won most of the money as visitors
to the Cup meetings), A. P. Bowman and McDonald.
Nobody won £3OOO, and only six touched four
figures; but nearly 60 owners—-doctors and share-
brokers and graziers and so on—got from £250 up-
wards to help pay for their fun. #
The system of handicapping horses for the
“Nationals” is likely to be amended in the future.
Attention has been called to the fact that there is
only a margin of 2st. between the top and. bottom
■weights in a Liverpool G. N. Steeplechase, which is a
slow-run race compared with a rush over the big
sticks at Flemington and Caulfield. In the still
faster hurdle races, over the sarrije courses, a differ-
ence of 3st. in the limit imposts ,is a palpable ab-
surdity, proved by figures. Seeing- that there are no
w f a events for jumping horses, the top notchers
ought to be given’a fair chance to win rich prizes
in more than one season.

“Fairplay”: After the second day of the
A.J.C. Easter meeting, it was reported that a fund
promoted by Ikev Cohen and Co., to block the totali-
sator in N.S.W.", amounted to about £3500. Now
that the totalisator has been blocked without any
need to fall back on that fund, the Parliamentary
Commission having voted against it after a long
and careful and dispassionate investigation, I would
suggest that the fund be donated to the N.S.W.
country hospitals. Of course I am assuming that
there is such a fund. #
It has to he confessed, very sadly, that so
far the Australian contingent at Stockholm has not
set Lake Malar on fire, or caused the Swedish capital
to rock on its foundations. Our glory is one with
Nineveh and Tyre, and excepting as regards tfie
swimming contingent, our representatives will be
sent empty away. In the 800 metres national teams
championship, our men spread-eagled the opposition.
Yankeedom was beaten by 9sec. and Bull Land. bjr
17. That was in the male section. In the ladies
section, Miss Fanny Duraclt scooped the 100 metres,
with Miss Nina .Wylie in second, place. In one of
the heats Miss Durack upset the world’s record by
winning in lmin. 19 4-ssee. The rest of the Aus-
tralians were outclassed, excepting the riflemen, and
they didn’t compete. S. H, Poulter collapsed at 20
miles; the eight-oar crew went down, after a big
effort, to Leander, of England; and the rest were
just squelched. # #
The N.S.W. bowlers are having a success-
ful campaign in Britain just now —a high old time,
for 22 games won, one drawn, and 10 lost is the
record to the end of last week.
N.S.W. champion athlete J. Temple Wood
added another bauble to his well-stocked pantry on
Saturday, by roaming home in the Bananaland three-
mile championship at Brisbane. The tallest labors
of that important afternoon., however, went to T.
Francis, who won the 440yds., and filled second place
in the 100 and 880 yards championships.
The death of “Jacky” McGowan last week
eclipsed the gaiety of Melbourne’s sporting world —
which is to say that everybody who has ever given
a thought to boxing looked serious for five minutes,
and remarked that the noble art had lost its noblest
artist, or words to that effect. Among pugilists
curly-headed McGowan was something of an Adonis
and quite the little gentleman. He had lived re-
snectably at the game since he was He was
“bantam champion” at 19, lightweight champion of
Australia 18 years later, and, in his 40th year, he
died from the effects of a small injury received whilst
he was giving a lesson to a pupil at Melbourne
University. The calamitous ’Varsity boy happened
to hit teacher’s right eye with his head, which caused
sufficient concussion of the brain to require a rest
cure But McGowan didn’t take a spell, as advised
bv the doctor. He continued to work for the next
fortnight, and then, after boxing a couple of light
rounds in the afternoon, at the Melbourne Athletic
Club room, he suddenly collapsed. Next morning
he died.of hemorrhage of the brain. Jacky s indiffer-
ence to the doctor’s warning and his wife’s fears will
be cited as a caution to athletes whose muscular fit-
ness tempts them into danger. This good Australian
"eft a widow and six children. He was so young
when he married—handsome boys are mostly marked
for early matrimony—that two of his daughters are
already'grown up. * * *
Brisbane bad a splendid afternoon foi its
first motor-boat speed carnival on Saturday after-
noon, and the city emptied itself on to the
banks of the river to see the wondrous sight N.S.M.
was represented by A. Hordern’s famous Kangaroo,
which was the only outsider present. Other starters
were Queenslander, Cooroy and Alma and the dis-
tance was 17 miles. Kangaroo took the lead at the
end of the first mile, and was streaking away when
the boats disappeared from view round the bend
The onlookers regarded the race as won. But it
wasn’t, for the boat that came skimming back into
view was the Cooroy, and not the Kangaroo The
craft that was hull down in the distance wasn t the
Kangaroo either, but the Queenslander ; and the Kan-
garoo did not come in view till s °m e time after.
Then it was noticed to be limping badly, and its tail
was bruised. Something had. gone wrong with the
engine, and Mr. Hordern retired. Cooroy fled on,
and won easily from Queenslander, while Alma was
still a mere speck.

Experienced tug-o’-war captains are at a
premium iust now, and two or three old hard-heads
are disposing of themselves by auction to the various
teams which are anxious to scoop in the big money
at the Stadium in the international pulling scrap.
Of course, in the actual pulling, the captains will
have to belong to the nationality of their teams, but
the demand is for training captains. It seems the
Syrians will represent the Ottoman Empire, but they
deeply resent being called Turks for all that. _ Chances
are that some Turks will shortly be objecting also.
Mclntosh is putting on a special prize for the Aus-
tralians, and has also arranged for an amateur sec-
tion the members of which will pull amateurs only,
and’turn doWn golden coin of the realm in favor-of
electroplate, table silver, etc. It is prophesied that
there will be a great night for Ireland when the
ancient race chooses its team, for* at present there
are enough exiles in training to make a respectable
army. God help the selectors, and bring them safely
out 'of it home to their trembling families.
* * * *
The other morning Mclntosh was reading
his Bible by the sad sea waves, and came across a
solemn exhortation to “Put not your trust in princes.
He dropped the holy book and thought hard. By
gosh!” he remarked, “this applies to me. This box-
ing game is absolutely dependent on the will of the
princes of the people. 111 lay up other treasure.
Then he carefully gathered up his Book, and tearing
back into town secured the corner of Elizabeth and
King streets, and started to put up a brand-new
building, to be opened shortly as a sports materials
depbt; bought a few suburban places of amusement,
and finished a strenuous week as the proprietor and
moving spirit of about half a dozen new enterprises.
Then having done these things, he went down to the
Hotel Australia, and got loose on the question of
how to inaugurate “United Service Cots” at the
Royal Alexandra Hospital for Sick Children.
“Population,” said Mac, “is. the country’s best de-
fence, and these cots will help to conserve popula-
tion. So they’ve got to be put in. And they are
going to be. And by co-operation of the naval and
military forces. The newly-roofed and reconstructed
Stadium is hereby offered, free of charge, for the
night of Thursday, August 15; so let us get busy
devising how to rake in the dollars.” Eventually, it
was decided to hold a Grand Roman Carnival in
three phases. The naval and military will give
sword and shield combats, gladiatorial net and spear
melfies, cutlass and foil contests and drill turns.
The Arts will take the floor, and show tableaux
and speed sketching, etc. ; after which the Y.M.C.A.,
R.A.G.A., metropolitan police and fire brigades will
show fancy skating, pillow- and pole-fighting with
colored pillows, blindfolded boxing matches and a
few dozen other things.
“Plum” Warner has the courage to set
down both Trumper and Hill as ’’has-beens.” His
idea of an XI of the World is: Hordern, Armstrong
and Macartney from Australia; Faulkner and Sher-
well from Africa; King from Philadelphia; with.
Fry, Spooner, Foster, Hobbs and Barnes. To the
Australian eye, Fry is the doubtful spot in this team.
He seldom has risen to a great occasion; and this
writer would pick either Nourse, of S’Africa, or
Rhodes, of Yorkshire, as a safer investment.

HOW SORE THROATS ARE CAUGHT
And How to Cure and Prevent Them.
IN the da>s of our grandparents,
there was a general idea that sore
throats were due to draughts and
wet or cold weather.
People who had a genius for catch-
ing sore throats (as so many of us
have to-dajr!) always took great care
to muffle up their throats, to avoid
draughts, and to wear a respirator
during cold, wet, or foggy weather.
Yet they still went on catching sore
throat!
Nowadays, we realise that sore
throat is an infectious ailment which
has very little to do with the weather.
Cold, damp weather may be one of
the causes of sore throat, but only
because it lowers our vitality, and
makes us susceptible to the microbes
of sore throat —that is all.
These microbes or germs are the
true active causes of sore throat, as
they are of those dread infectious
•diseases diphtheria, consumption
of the lungs, measles, and scarlet
fever.
The Germs of Sore Throat.
These germs are only too plentiful,
especially at this time of the year.
We meet them every day, every
hour, in every public telephone, in
every public conveyance, in every
crowded, stuffy place where we may
breathe the germ-laden breath of
sufferers from sore throats, convales-
cents, and people sickening for some
infectious disease.
At last, however, science has given
us a safeguard against these risks.
There has now been produced a
germ-killing throat tablet which
cleanses the mouth and throat from
disease germs as easily and as rapidly
as dirt is removed from the skin. It
is called Wulfing’s Formamint, and
can be tested by anyone without ex-
pense. (See note at the end of this
article.) No one susceptible to sore
throat who has not already tried
Formamint should delay to do so ;
for Wulfing’s Formamint is a trust-
worthy cure for that complaint, as
well as a preventive of infectious
diseases.
To understand the value of this
discovery, we must remember that
all germs including the most
deadly ones like
the Diphtheria
Bacilli — are
living particles
of vegetable life,
ext remely
minute, but visi-
ble under high
powers of the
microscope. For
their proper de-
velopment, these
seeds or germs
must find a
“suitable soil.”
This they have
in the soft lining
of the mouth and
throat, which
gives them the
warmth and
moisture they
need.
In such a re-
ceptive soil,
germs will flou-
rish like the pro-
verbial green bay
tree, until they
multiply into
whole colonies.
1
• 1
mm
The above picture shows how the germs which
cause -ore throat and tonsillitis are destroyed by
means of the germ-killing throat tablet described in
this article. The round plate, coated with a sub-
stance on which disease germs quickly develop, was
inoculated with the germs of sore throat, which
immediately began to grow. The right half of the
plate was then treated with saliva from a person
who had sucked three tablets of Formamint—the
germ-killing throat tablet. The result was that all
the germs on it were destroyed, while those on the
left hand (not treated with Formamint) grew
luxuriantly. Exactly the same thing happens in
the mouth of people who suck Formamint Tablets—
the germs are quickly killed and sore throat is
easily cured and prevented.
In the case of an ordinary sore throat,
they merely produce symptoms of
pain and. discomfort, which quickly
disappear when a few Formamiut
Tablets are sucked.
If. however, the germs are of a
more harmful kind, they produce
certain poisons which get in to the
blood and set up diseases like
diphtheria, scarlet fever, or
measles.
This is where the value of Forma-
mint lies as a disease -preventive, for
Formamint is the most effectual
method known to Science of killing
these germs in the mouth and throat
before they become dangerous.
It should be clearly understood,
however, that
Formamint is not
a cure for such
diseases as diph-
theria, when
once they have
established
themselves in
the system.
But there is
no doubt what-
ever that, if
taken in time,
Formamint will
certainly pre-
vent diphtheria
and kindred
germ - diseases,
even though one
has actually
been in close
contact with the
patient. For this
reason, doctors,
nurses and sani-
tary inspectors
always take
Formamint Tab-
lets when they
have a case of in-
fectious disease.
Many distinguished persons have
publicly testified to the value of
Formamint. To take only a few
examples :
Remarkable Letters from Prominent
People.
Ford Glantawe writes: “I have
been using Formamint for sore throat
with most satisfactory results.”
Madame Adelina Patti writes : “ I
have taken Formamint Tablets for
some time past, and have found them
very beneficial to the throat.’’
Mr. C. C. Hutchinson, K.C.,
writes : “ Through the great benefit
I have derived from Formamint
Tablets, I have recommended them
for sore throat to hundreds of other
people.”
It is this personal recommendation
which has done so much to spread
Formamint’s fame far and wide, and
none are more enthusiastic about it
than doctors and scientists them-
selves. Among the latter several
have made exhaustive laboratory
experiments with Formamint, one of
the most recent of which is depicted
in the centre of this article.
It should be noted that there is no
duplicate or substitute for Forma-
mint, because Wulfing’s Formamint
marks the discovery of a new
chemical compound, which is manu-
factured by a patented process and
can only be produced by the firm of
Messrs. A. Wulfing & Co. The
real thing is sold by all Chemists,
in bottles containing 50 tablets. To
prevent substitution, the purchaser
should specify Wulfing’s Formamint.
(Note. —Any reader of this article who has not yet
tried Formamint, and would like to do so, is requested
to write to the makers, Messrs. A. Wulfing & Co., 17
Bond Street, Sydney, N.S.W., who will be pleased to
send a free sample and an interesting handbook.
Kindly mention The Bulletin when writing, and
enclose two penny stamps towards postage.)

0.8.P.L.: Sorry that your local paper
with the article on “The Effects of Protection in the
United States,” seems to have gone astray. But
your letter of advice reached us. Now, tell us:
If your local editor is an authority of such tonnage
on large economic questions that his article settles
the question, why isn’t he doing something better
than running a paper in an outside town of about
500 people?.. . Ignoramus: Andrew Fisher was Prime
Minister of Australia (Please note the distinction ;
“Premier” is good enough for the State boss of Tas-
mania or N.S.W., but the only man in all the world
who is political head of a whole continent deserves
to be called “Prime Minister”) from November 13,
1908, to June 2, 1909. His second term of office
began on April 29, 1910 lt.McK.: Accept your
assurance that the editor of the Vic. Agricultural
Gazette isn’t required to know anything about agri-
culture. Don’t see, however, that that improves the
case very much. This paper’s idea is that he ought
to be required to know something about it... . Taffy:
The gist of your poem is vague wonderment as to
what the Society maiden learnt during the three
dances she sat out. My girl, it is a million to one:
she learnt nothing—and you can take it whichever

so feeble that they collapsed on the way to the gag-
repairing department. .. . D.R.: The variety of jest
that has to be led up to by half a dozen questions
and answers is no good to us. .. .11.W.G.: You’ll
almost certainly fall in unless you have' personal
knowledge of the alleged “town blocks,” which are
liable to be in a swamp seven miles out. .. .Boswell:
But, after all, Boswell, seeing that the N.S.W.
Labor Government has “blacklegged” or “scabbed”
on its alleged Labor principles (the pro-
gramme pledges it to reduce borrowing and
to spend loan money only on works which
will pay full interest and sinking fund), why
call Ferguson a traitor ? There is no evidence to
prove that he is so bad a traitor as McGowen and Co.
Nobody who is resolved to adhere solidly to the
Labor programme can afford to be found dead with
McGowen and co., considering the borrowings of that
marvellous combination Kockyite: Exhibit A

F.C.8.: Hardly a whiff of smoke in your description

and good intentions, we publish three verses of “The
Murder; or the Man Who Stabbed his Grandpa”:—
With a long sharp knife he slew him,
He stabbed him on the neck.
Nor all his belated repentance
The flowing blood could check.
And now he walks the world round
And bears the brand of Cain.
Nor all his tears and anguish
Can wash it off again.
The man that stabbed his grandpa
Stabbed him with a peck.
The man that stabbed his grandpa
Stabbed him in the neck.

Baden-Powell has a nephew in this part
of the world, though he did not go to the

When Michael Scott, our very own golfer,
who has just won the amateur championship
of France, after doing well in the West of
England, was in these parts, he set himself
and his household at the very gates of the
Sandringham links, in order to lose no time
travelling to and from his devotions. Lord
Eldon, who is Michael’s father, had Here-
shoff, the American champion, staying with
him in Portman Square, and the house party
used to fly westward in three motor cars.
Osmund and Denys Scott, older brothers of
| Michael, and therefore nearer the coronet,
are also golf enthusiasts. Mrs. Michael,
who was Miss Cecilia Bruton, of
Sydney, is feverishly taking lessons in
the family religion near where father-in-
law has given her a lovely country cottage
furnished by Waring’s. The head of the
house also gives his youngest son and his
wife apartments in the town house, and a
motor wherein to whirl to and from the
country place. Baby Scott, who used to play
on the Sandringham beach with a golf ball,
is luxuriating in a pony cart built to fit her-
self and nurse. One way and another, the
Scotts are very comfortable, thank you, and
manage to take life not too seriously. The
fearfully high price of golf balls is about the
only worry they have.

Ingersoll—the watch with
the Quality in the right place
Do not buy a watch for its pretty case. It is the move-
ment or works that make it keep time. Seven-eighths of the
cost of every Ingersoll goes into the works —to ensure quality
of material and workmanship.
In the cheap showy class, the cost is put into the case,
and little or no consideration is given to the accuracy of the
mechanism.
The only way to make sure that you get an accurate,
reliable cheap watch is to see that the narr/e “ Ingersoll ” is
on the dial of the watch you buy.

RINGWORMS ON
NECK AND FACE
Tormenting Itching and a Shocking
Sight. From School 6 Months.
Tried Everything, but Did No
Good, Applied CuticuraOintment
and Ringworms Disappeared.
“My little girl was covered with ringworms
ail down her neck and her little face, with
the tormenting itching,
was a misery to the poor
child and a shocking
sight. She had to stop
away from school for
six months and I was
really frightened she
would never get better.
I tried everything people
would advise me, but
none of them nor any
doctor’s advice did any
good till one day I saw
your advertisement of
Cuticura and I sent for the Ointment and also
bought some later on which I applied to her
head and neck and before very long the itch-
ing ceased and the ringworms all disappeared,
within five weeks from the time I commenced
using the Cuticura Ointment. My little girl
tells everybody how she was cured of the
ringworms she had.
“I gave some of the Ointment to a lady
next door for her baby anci she _ tells.J ll !® -*t
has cured her little head of the itch it had.
“I cannot tell you how thankful I am to
the cure bv Cuticura Ointment rmr can I
sneak too highly of same when I think ofthe
ringworms my little girl had.” (Signed) Mrs.
Fletcher. 81 Bell view Street, North Sydney,

If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“ half” will then be seen to have the appearance

only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut

are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger

HOWTO
GROW HAIR
A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results
NEW PREPARATION CAUSES BIG STIR AMONG HAIR SPECIALISTS
The above clearly shows Results irom a Short Course ot my True Hair-Growing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower. _
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached, the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
1 had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested m every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not onlv did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also:
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a* brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, 1 fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his'hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
a's a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. 1
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after-
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as' when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal Fight to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

George Augustus Sala, whose mother was_ an
actress, and, who, as a young man, earned his living
in the painting-room of a theatre, used to say that in
his wide experience of mankind he had found none
,so egregiously ponceited as mummers. Their per-
■sorial vanity,* he reckoned, had no suspicion of its
ingrained foolishness. Their belief in their import-
ance to the little world that flattered them was rooted
in their souls. No adulation could be too fulsome
for. them. Sala certainly didn’t overstate the case,
.judging from* the paragraph that Oscar Asche' sup-
plied to the Melbourne press just previous to his self-
esteem getting a bump from the incoming Quinlan
Opera show. “Mr. Oscar Asche and Miss Lily Bray-
ton have decided to charge Is. for their autographs
and ?s. for signed portraits, many requests for
which* are made to them daily through the post.
The money derived from this source will be handed
to the Melbourne Hospital fund.” The fact that a
number of persistent gallery girls and kindred
mummer-worshippers crave the autographs and photo-
graphs of himself and wife wouldn’t justify Oscar
in charging one and two “bob” for the favors, if he
were not quite convinced that he is offering fair value
for cash. The fact that he advertises his willingness
to scrawl his signature on behalf of a iiospital fund
proves his belief in the sanity of his idolators. It
states the worth of his autograph in his own estima-
tion, without heed to the absurdity of the applica-
tions for it. There is no thought in the Asche philo-
sophy of autograph-hunters paying a compliment to
the “lions” they pursue. The lion merely roars his
readiness to seil hairs from his mane at a shilling
apiece.
Curious that no playwright should have realised the
dramatic possibilities of vegetarianism until now.
The amusing piece, “A Modem Crusader,” by Flor-
ence Adgar Hobson, was lately produced in London.
The scene is laid in a meat shop. The butcher’s
pretty daughter is a pronounced vegetarian, and loathes
the sight of meat. Her lover is a vegetarian doctor,
and also detests chops, kidneys and such like. A
oassionate love scene in the butchery is interrupted
by the meat-selling father who curses vegetarians of
every description for ruining his business. , The
butcher is reinforced by the villain of the piece, a
country clergyman, who holds to the belief that
roast beef is essential to England’s greatness. It is
a cheerful, sketchy little thing, not quite in the
same street with “The Comedy of Errors,” but it is
I good so far as it goes, and it goes all right so far as
it goes.
“Avon”: Brander Matthews has scraped up for
the Philadelphia Fine Arts Club what seems to be
all the information to be got about Shakspeare as
an actor. Bill appears to have acted, all along, only
old-man parts. The only definite record is that he
was the Ghost in “Hamlet,” Adam in “As You Like
It,” and Old Knowell in Jonson’s “Every Man in
his Humor.” He also played a character in Jon-
son’s “Sejanus.” Queen Elizabeth commanded a
series of performances by the Globe Company in
1594. Burbage was leading tragedian and Kemp
leading comedian. Shakspeare was in the cast,
but low down in the bill. He evidently acted all
the time he was in London, and we can run through
his plavs and guess his parts: Holofernes in “Love s
Labor 'Lost,” Gonzalo in “The Tempest” (probably
too late for his acting), Leonato in “Much Ado,,
Kent in “Lear,” and Quince in “Midsummer Night s
Dream.” His salary as actor would be about £lOO
a year, and as writer only about £2O. This £l2O
equals £lOOO to-day. When he became manager,
or as Irving, sen., said, only an actor with a share,
he” made a good deal more. The poems show that
he detested acting—like Macready, who,, at his
zenith, wrote of “My miserable profession.
June 1 was the closing night of the Canterbury,
London’s pioneer music-hall. The Canterbury Arms,
the pub in whose back yard or skittle alley the
music-hall was evolved, had a record covering sev-
eral centuries. In old times it was a favorite house
for pilgrims, on account of its proximity to West-
minster Abbev and Lambeth Place; and there is a
London tradition that Shakspeare and his company
of playgoers gave afternoon performances there. It
was in the Canterbury, in Morton’s time, that selec-
tions from Gounod’s “Faust” were first heard in
London. There, too, Emily Soldene sang before she
became a star in comic opera, and it was at the
same place that Harry Rickards made lus early suc-
cess as a comic singer. It has remained fairly popu-
lar right along to the present; but a railway co.
owns the site and wants it now for its own prosaic
puffing and whistling purposes.
“J F II.”: The long reign of Alfred Moul, erst-
while slashing musical critic of Melbourne Aon, has
come to an end at the London Alhambra. For 14
years he has been in charge of the old house at
Leicester Square, the first four as general manager
and the last decade as managing director. , But the
Alhambra has fallen behind of late, and is unable
to pav a dividend this year. If he had been given
a free hand Moul would long since have reconstructed
the ancient/ house, but he wasn’t, so the Coliseum,
Paladium and other sumptuous and cheap palaces of
variety got ahead and threaten to stay there per-
manently.
“Northern Australia,” said Sydney Tele-
graph recently, “is not a country to send
immigrants to indiscriminately.” The same
might he said of Heaven. If Judas Iscariot
was sent there indiscriminately, the other
inhabitants might object to him.
THE KILTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Great grief is felt in the Scottish regiments over
the proposal to abol.sh the kilts.
—News item or pibroch.
If all the Scots have nubbly knees
And their delight’s to air them,
If all their patriotism wilts
Unless they are allowed the kilts,
Will some kind person tell me, please,
Why don’t the Scotsmen wear them?
I’d like to see a kilt once more
In this drab world of Wowsers,
But not a Scotsman that I know
Will kilted to his office go;
The race mist have a fondness for
Unpatriotic trousers.
If other garb his proud soul hurts,
Why shouldn't he go gaily,
With kilts to keep him nice and warm?
Is he but Scotch in uniform?
If he’s so fond of scanty skirts,
Why don’t he use them daily?
McCormick, clerking in a bank,
(lUs girl might think them silly.)
McCredie, hitting up a score,
Or given out for “kilt before,”
McArdle, cabbie in a rank
(On hansoms they’d be chilly).
McClusky, skates upon his feet,
(Most awkward 1 if he fell down!)
McQuitty, sporting in the sea,
In nicely kilted neck-to-knee,
And Miss McLuckie on the street
(No doubt she’d wear them well down).
And Sergeant Mac, in kilt of blue,
A lordly Scottish copper,
McKillop, man of brawny fist,
A skirted, White Hope pugil'st,
Me Wowser, too —these' are a few
Who think the kilt iinproper.
So if they’re proud of Scottish legs,
Why don’t the owners bare them ?
If their keen patriotism wilts
Unless they are attired in kilts,
This meek Australian person begs
These patriots to wear them.

Rifles, Shotguns' and Cartridges
THE RED W BRAND
4
There is such an intimate relation between a gun
and its cartridges that neither will shoot well if there
is any defect in either. The cartridges must be
uniform in size and shooting strength no less than
the gun must be accurate and reliable. The combi-
nation of Winchester guns and cartridges seems best
to fulfill these requirements. And why should not
this be so ? for Winchester guns and cartridges are
made in the same factory and tested together. Win-
chester Repeating and Single Shot Rifles and Repeat-
ing Shotguns are made for all kinds of shooting, and
Winchester Cartridges for all makes of shotguns, rifles
and pistols. Get the celebrated Winchester make.

leaped or loped or sloped steeply to the bush,
taking with him, by force, it is said, a girl
who was in the company of Cozzell, de-
ceased. The police have been looking more
or less persistently ever since, but though
they have found a great deal of earth and a
lot of trees, they haven’t found the girl or
the alleged slayer of Cozzell. But for the
fact that some persistent member asks occa-
sional questions in the Assembly, the mat-
ter might be justly considered closed.
Minister Appel informed the House the other
day that they hadn’t got a scent even of
“the supposed murderer of Cozzell, who was
alleged to have been killed.” Presumably,
Cozzell was also alleged to have been born,
else he couldn’t have been allegedly but-
chered. The photograph, etc., of the “al-
leged murderer” was “published in the
Police Gazette, and circulated through the
Commonwealth and other parts of the world.”
But, so far, the “alleged murderer” hasn’t
obliged the country by leaving himself or the
girl with the nearest policemen, and there are
very srrave doubts that he ever intends to do
so. Still, the police have his photograph.
One “Mary Jane” recently dealt with the
domestic help question in the Courier. She
was a very interesting Mary Jane, and what
she had to say was very well worth reading.
Here is a sample:—
A servant should- be able to come out of her room
on Sunday morning with her Bible and prayer-book,
and jjjijy: “Madame, like yourself, I am a Christian.
I do no work on the Sabbath.”
And, in theory, it makes one’s heart warm
to Mary Jane, for it is good Democratic
sentiment, and wholly in keeping with the
Ten Commandments. And yet some of the
glory fades on closer inspection. So far as
the Sabbath goes, the grand old decalogue
was fairly well fitted for a people who led a
simple life in tents in a warm climate, sleep-
ing on skins or straw, having practically
no furniture and not much cookery. But in
a modern house a Sunday run on the pro-
posed lines would mean dust, and crusts,
and ashes, and dirty dishes, and neglected
slops, and unemptied baths, and unwashed
children, and unmade beds, and unshaved
men, and hair-tangled women who weren’t
laced up the back (even Mary Jane
wouldn’t have her tidy frock hooked up the
back unless somebody worked a little), and
muddy boots, and a barbaric grabbing of
cold victuals out of cupboards or on mantel-
pieces, instead of an orderly laying of meals.
The blinds wouldn’t be raised. The unfed
dog would howl and the unfed cat would
caterwaul. In fact, one Sunday—just
on which neither Mary Jane, nor her mis-
tress, nor her mistress’s daughters, nor the
boss, nor his sons, nor the hired man, nor
anybody else worked would reduce a civil-
ised modern household to the level of the
aborigines. And they would probably be
murdered towards evening, because the Chris-
tian policeman, and the Christian detective,
and the Christian soldier would all have left
off toil, and nobody would be throwing him-
self into his regular occupation with all his
heart and soul save the unchristian Bill
Sikes. As for the trim (provided she but-
toned down the front) and pleasant-looking
Mary Jane who came out of her room that
morning with her Bible and prayer-book
and her beautiful remark about doing no
work on the Sabbath —well, she would pro-
bably be a robbed and draggled Mary Jane
before she reached the sacred edifice, unless
some good people were content to toil on
the holy day. And she would be fortunate
if she arrived at the tabernacle with her
honor intact, for if there was a cop on Sun-
day duty he would have to be a shameful
and impious cop, and that kind would pro-
bably be worse than none at all.
“Mimosa”; According to Rock-
hampton (Q.) papers, Lady Mac-
gregor was recently given an ostrich
feather grown ifli Queensland, and
valued at £l5. As regards the
value of the gaud I have my
doubts. At this rate, Queensland
feathers would work out at about
£390 per lb., which is an enormous
figure as against the record price
in open market at Cape Colony, of
£77 per lb., for “primes” (the
white wing feathers of theT* male
bird). I have seen feathers grown
in three States of Australia, and
the best of these “primes” I con-
sider would not realise at the Cape
£8 per lb. As for locally-grown
“feminas” (that is the white wing
feathers of the female bird), they
would not fetch a fiver per pound.
Australia cannot compete with
South Africa in the ostrich busi-
ness. It lacks the quality of bird
to start the enterprise with, and
South Africa has had the horse
sense to so legislate that Australia
is going to continue to lack that
class of bird, just as Australia
should legislate against South
Africa in the matter of stud sheep.
“Ivobbi”: Isaac Carloss, who
died. at Gympie recently, made
a bit of history in his time.
He was mixed up in the Chartist
riots of ’4B. Later, he figured with Cobden,
Bright and Joseph Hume in the struggle to
wipe out the™ direct taxation (a penny
stamp on each issue and a duty of Is. 6d.
on each advt.) that made a cheap news-
paper impossible. Then he came to Vic-
toria, and, of course, was at Eureka. He
tried Gympie next, and Gympie saw him
through.
- Latest statistics re Queensland insolvencies
show that laborers have filed their schedules
most numerously of all classes during the
past 12 months. Storekeepers, as a body,
are the most unfinancial of Bananaland’s
citizens, their assets running on an average
some 2s. or 3s. in the £. And a certain
spinster who accumulated debts to the ex-
tent of £6OO, assets nil, showed what a
woman can do when she tries.
Queensland Democrats used to boast that
the Western Laborites were the most regu-
lar and enthusiastic voters in the country.
To-day the case is far otherwise. In the
Gregory only 466 per 1000 voted at the
recent election; in the Mitchell only 530 per
1000. On the other hand, two Brisbane
constituencies, Buranda and Ithaca, polled
870 per 1000 apiece of all possible votes.
Probably the man in the West is so much
accustomed to seeing the same fellow re-
turned year after year that he has come to
the conclusion the thing’s as safe as houses
whether he votes or whether he doesn’t.
Shifters of Sin.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
\Ve are the Purity Party ; foemen of Living Unclean,
Scavengers we of your morals, nosing the matter
obscene ;
Haters of guzzle a-nd gambling, fierce on the drab
and the drink,
Pushing the minions of Evil nearer and nearer the
brink ;
Saying to Tot and to Flossie—“ ’Way from our
suburb select!
Get you a harbor, ye gay ones, out of the sight of
our sect;
’Way with the feast and the frolic; down with the
dance and the din!
’Way for ITs ! Know Us and fear Us! We are the
Shifters of Sin!”
Right from the Dawn of Creation We have been
moving It on,
Moving from Dan to Beersheba —will the Thin g never
be gone ?
Out of the Garden we drove It, partner of Adam
and Co.,
And, when it settled beside them, angrily ordered It:
“Go!”
Drove It to Moab to-day, and harried it thence on
the morrow
(Ever it fled us elusive, coming again to our sorrow) ;
No matter how we pursued it, ever it turned with a
grin,
Laughed at our face in derision; scoffed at the
Shifters of Sin.
Nothing availed us to hem It —prison nor cloister
nor narrow sea,
Fire that was laid to the faggot, scourge i’ the hand
of the Pharisee;
When we had purged the chapel, wielding the broom
and the birch,
Lo ! We would find it ensconced high with a Prince
of the Church ;
When we had chastened his Highness, driving the
pest from his Palace,
Up in the Senate ’twould jeer us, smiling in insolent
malice: —
•‘Bone of your bone am I, mortals; bred in your
blood and your skin,
Wherefore I laugh at your hounding—ye who are
Shifters of Sin!
“Did ye not ‘purify’ Corinth, harbor of rake and of
harlot ?
Did ye not cry in your wisdom—-Woe to the wearers
of Scarlet ?
Have ye not lavendered London, cleansed her of Chloe
and Clarice ?
Have ye not whited the sepulchre—put a new coat
upon Paris?
Them who were gaudy and giddy, have ye not harried
and vext,
Till in their panic they flitted out of one street to
the next?
All of your clamor and yammer, ’tis but a tinkling
of tin,
’Tis but a sounding of cymbals—weariless Shifters
of Sin !
“I who was mighty in Rome, I who was Mother of
Nero,
Shall I be wroth that you rail at picture and jig and
bolero ?
I who have run through the byways, panting beside
Messalina,
Can I but smile when you rate at light-o’-love Nettie
and Nina?
Scourge me and ban me and purge me —ever my
home is the same,
Here in the heart of your city, right in the core of
the game;
Morning may shrive me and drive me. Even will
beckon me in,
Giving me room at your hearthstone, Lifters and
Shifters of Sin!”
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, July 20, 1912.
My Hear Thargomindah,—
Our Governor Macgregor got back to his
adopted heath on Friday, feeling fine after
his trip to Fraser Island. The same even-
ing, his dame, encased in black velvet, doled
out some hundreds of Trinity College certifi-
cates to young musicians. To-day (Satur-
day) his Ex. himself, with a hand strength-
ened by his Island holiday, is hauling up the
premiership pennant won by the Toowong
Bowling Club.
On Monday, Governor Fullfer, of Victoria,
who has been ordered north for a change
from his cold State, arrived by Orient
boat, with Help Curwen in attendance. He
goes on to Belle Vue station, where the
Vumley Hill lady will be his hostess.
Croquet, bowls and a quiet game of euchre
have supplied all the social thrill of the
week. Life, in fact, is one mad whirl of
excitement. Sometimes I can’t remember
what were trumps last Thursday se’nnight.
A team of bowlers arrived from Lismore
during the week, and were sweat into the
vortex by a euchre party at Rowe’s Cafe.
The croquet courts- at Ascot have been in-
fested by a visiting team from your parts,
and generally athletics have been booming.
Mrs. Dick Casey, of Melbourne, is winter-
ing here, and has been visiting her sister,
Mrs. Lumley Hill, at Belle Vue.
The dances of the week were several. On
Tuesday the Flying Squadron held its an-
nual leap in the Centennial Hall. Nautical
emblems, such as anchors, playing cards and
corkscrews, were mingled artistically with
the decorations, and a miniature pile light
winked loudly upon the stage. The only
depressing circumstance about the function
was the absence of President James Chap-
man. During the afternoon his stables were
burnt down and his beautiful horse fried ; so,
for the first time for many years, the Chap-
man family was not represented. Numerous
sympathetic references were made during the
evening. The horse was generally esteemed.
The attendance at Albion Park Races to-
day was poor, and the “roar of the Ring,”
so dear and yet so remunerative to the horse
poet, was not much more than a rustle, like
dead birds or dead leaves. The motor-boat
race and the panto, matinee absorbed most
of the available people, and, anyhow, there
weren’t enough to go round for three func-

tions. (I find the best plan is to get up on
a roof and watch the populace straggling to
to. the local gaieties. You can always be
with the crowd if you watch out.) At the
theatre you couldn’t find a vacant seat in
the circle, and the gallery was so crowded
that it would have groaned if it had dared,
but if it had dared to groan it might have
burst. On the river, Hordern’s bounding
Kangaroo tried to streak away as it did in
Sydney Harbor some months ago; but it
misfired repeatedly, and retired sulkily, like
a burst and embittered marsupial, leaving
the other boats to fight it out among them.
Last Wednesday the Photographic Society
put by the printing frame and the evil-
smelling solutions, in order to perform the
usual yearly gyrations in the Caf6 Majestic.
The only debutante was Miss Sutherland,
who was under the wing of her aunt, Mrs.
Bob Bell. Miss Sutherland wor* the usual
white, while auntie Bell spread paje grev
draperies sprinkled over with liand-painted
roses.
Holyrood House, the home of the Marshall
Millers, was very gay on Thursday when
daughter Ruby entertained a mixed com-
pany of about 50 flappers and chappies at a
dance. Mrs. Miller wore old gold satin
while Ruby was in young pink. Chinese
lanterns and wattle made an effective back-
ground to the festivities.
The Corinda Assembly, on Thursday, was
the usual dazzling spectacle. Pale blue muB-
- with half a pint of silver stars, gave one
a fleeting impression that the roof had been
removed secretly at vast expense. Unfor-
tunately, the effect was marred by the addi-
tion ot sundry pink bows, suggesting boiled
lobsters on the wing. Mrs. Steele, Mrs W
N. Robertson, Mrs. Raff, and Mrs W m'
Robertson aided by a flock of girlettes, ’saw
to it that all (except the boiled lobsters!
was as it should be—or as near thereto ns
possible under the circumstances.

Mr. Arnold Lavers, who isn’t altogether
unknown to Brisbane, was married to Miss
Wilcox on Wednesday, in Toowoomba. The
bride was arrayed in the usual white
satin and lace, and (wo bridesmaids, one
pink and the other blue (as regards dress
of course; I don’t mean that one was
flushed and the other goose-fleshed), attended
her to the altar. The honeymoon is being
spent at Cairns and the Barron Falls. K
I)r. and Mrs. Robertson gave a bridge
party at Dunalister, Sherwood, last Wednes-
day There was no police rail, and the
guests are still at large and taking part in
the rush and turmoil of social life.
Must go up on the roof now and see what
is going to happen next.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE
Charleville lost a fine old pioneering
woman the other day in Mrs. Furlong, whoi
came to Western Queensland 47 years agoi.
bhe used to relate that for the first two
years of her life in that country she never
saw a white woman. Her husband was, of
course, a cattle pioneer, but the outbreak of
Charters Towers drew him and his wife
across country to the Northern goldfields.
Theie he earned distinction as the first occu-
S , of local cemetery. The old lady
used to tell how, when travelling overland
with her second husband, she was left alone
• 01 i™ 1 days ,, I°., l after a mob of horses
in the heart of the Central district, where
blacks were numerous and hostile. Still, she
pulled through Tropical Australia pro-
womeif wonderful breed of valiant men and
“Their provisions ran out, and for four
days they had nothing to eat. They' were
repeatedly washed off the raft and bruised all
over. Spent several nights in wet clothes,
and nearly perished of cold. For the greater
of the journey they could see no land,
and had not the remotest idea where they :
were. Once they struck an island occupied!
tWO pig f’ , °F e swam aw ay while the
other attacked them viciously. Reached
home at last,, and landed in a very ex-
hausted condition.” This is not a story of
shipwrecked mariners in the South Seas, but
an extract from the narrative of two bookies
who tneil to sail during recent floods from
Muttaburra to Longreaeh, on a raft made of
beer barrels.

It’s a real pleasure to use a

velvety touch it has, so durable
it is. Some people don’t trou-
ble about the make of Pencil
they buy, which is a mistake.
Is it not worth while specifying
“ Koh-i-noor ’’ and thus secure

not break, and outlasts six

Dear Sirs,—l am pleased to inform you that the Aerogen Safety Gas Machine purchased
from you nearly 12 months ago is working very satisfactorily and giving excellent results.
I find it very economical to run, and, on account of the automatic working, entails very
little attention.
The light is a most excellent one, and the gas is perfectly safe.
I shall be pleased to recommend it to anyone requiring an up-to-date light.
Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) H. A. McIvENZIE.
iffialifax, Queensland, 17th August, 1911.
Dear Sirs, —The Aerogen Gas Plant -which I purchased from your firm early in the year
has been giving thorough satisfaction, and I am perfectly pleased with it.
I have found Aerogen a most brilliant light, and, in my opinion, superior to all others.
The great charm with. Aerogen is its cleanliness, there being no refuse or offensive smell,
and for cheapness it surpasses any other light I have ever used. I shall be surprised if this
light does not take the place of Acetylene ha the near future.
Wishing your firm lots of succeus with these machines,
Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) O. T. LANGLEY.

WADHAM ECONOMISER
Contra-Flow Circulation System.
THE “WADHAM” works on the Contra-flow Circulation system,
increasing the efficiency 25 to 50 per cent, over the ordinary
parallel-flow type. It is the most up-to-date and successful
Economiser on the Market. Retains every valuable point of the ordin-
ary Standard Economiser, and in addition possesses a simple arrange-
ment of parts (patented) which give it the following important ad-
vantages
1. —Largely increased efficiency over the ordinary Economiser in util-
ising heat from the Waste Gases.
2.—Fewer pipes required for the same output, and consequent reduced
first cost.
3. —A Perfect blowing-out arrangement for removing sludge, thus
maintaining a higher efficiency and saving cost of scaling and
upkeep. The “Wadhain” is the only Economiser which works
efficiently with dirty water.
4.—Safety from explosions, owing to more perfect access of all sections
to the safety valve.
s.—Less sweating and deterioration—consequently longer life.
6. —Cheaper to erect and ship. Smaller space required.

New Edison Records
Are Now Ready.
Special attention in t.he August list of New Edison Records is directed to the Amberol
Concert numbers —sold at 3/6- each. These are much superior to the usual Amberol
Records, playing’ for the same length of time, from 4 to 4J minutes, on any machine
which will play Amberol Records, but they are sweeter, clearer, richer, and surface noise is
almost entirely eliminated. Special artists are being retained for the production of these
New Concert Records, and future issues will include Eleonora de Cisneros, Marguerite
Sylva, Riccardo Martin, etc.
In the ordinary Amberol and Standard Records there are .many specially brilliant items, the
most noteworthy being “Chimes of Normandy” airs, by the Edison Light Opera Co., “Spring
Voices” Waltz (Whistling solo) by Guido Gialdini, “Come to the Ball,” by Phillips and
Mixed Chorus, and “Uncle Josh in a Barber Shop,” by Cal. Stewart.
Call on your Edison dealer as soon as possible, and have the New Records played over for
you. If you do not know the address of a dealer write direct to us, and we will tell you
that of the nearest, as well as send you a . copy of the new Edison Record List, which gives
complete particulars of all Amberol and Standard Records to recent issues.

properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without
it, as taken at the beginning, a dose or two is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If von are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad
to hear of a simple and scientific device which will
restore your hearing, no matter how old you are.
There is no mystery or secrecy about it; we describe
it fully and explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and in the
same way you may use this sound magnifier as an
aid to weak hearing. But, unlike spectacles, the
Wilson Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and
comfortable. You can’t tell you are wearing them.
No one else can, either, because they are not seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off
them—the strain of trying to hear dim sounds.
What a blessed relief to have done with that
tiring strain !
Being made of the purest and softest Para rubber
they cannot be felt, even when the head rests on a
pillow. For the same reason, a blow on the side of
the head will not hurt the ear. In fact, they pro-
tect the ear, the tender inner parts that are so
senstive, from cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing
sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why these
facts are true, and why the Sound Magnifier restores
the hearing, we give an illustration of one as it lies
in the ear. You will notice that the Sound Magni-
fier is shaped
like a trumpet,
and so con-
veys even the
faintest sounds
right to the
natural ear-
drum. Being
of the softest
rubber, it can-
not hurt the
ear. It fits the
orifice of the
ear with preci-
sion and com-
fort. The di-
vision that
runs across the
mouth is to al-
low the remo-
val and inser-
tion of the
Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape
of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has
been chosen
after years of
experience a s
the best adapt-
ed to carry the faintest sound right down to the
natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not only
trying to have people shout at them, but it hurts
the ear-drum. When age comes the ear-drum some-
times gets thickened, or loses its tightness, and
shouting does not act properly on it. It only
makes a confused and tiring noise. But the
Sound Magnifiers concentrate the sound in the best
spot for perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-nerve
completely, or were born deaf, we cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could do that, in spite
of some of the absurd claims made to-day. But if
you can hear the faintest sound, do not despair.
You will never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from deaf people in
Australia and New Zealand, who have been cured,
and you can be cured, too. You may wear the Ear-
Drums day and night, and take them out whenever
you wish. Children can wear them (we have spe-
cial sizes for children from six to twelve). Even
a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they
are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover and
also an inserter. After the first pair is bought you
may purchase a single drum at any time for Bs.,
but the pair you get at first will last quite
two years. Do not ask for a trial pair. We do
not send them out on trial, and so they are never
secondhand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent you at once, with the fullest
instructions. Don’t delay, but have the comfort of
good hearing as soon as you can.

BILIOUS SUBJECTS
are generally victims of Constipation, that root evil of so many
terrible afflictions ; but they are “ bilious subjects ” no longer when
they adopt the famous Cockle’s Antibilious Pills as the standing
household remedy, now in the
Second Century of World-Wide Renown.
Cockle's Pills, which doctors of six generations have taught the world '
to use and esteem, have no harsh, coercive action on the sluggish orga;:_ ;
they gently stimulate, soothingly strengthen and encourage, the natural
organic functions, at the same time thoroughly cleansing the system and
purifying the vital fluid. There is nothing to equal Cockle s kills for
this perfect cleansing, reinvigorating, purifying combination of results.
It is marvellous.

TERRIBLE SHOOTING PAINS 8 SHORTNESS OF

Mr. MAYOR,

grave perils of neglecting to attend to
Nature’s warnings that the system is dis=
organised and requires attention is illus=
trated by the painful experience of Mr. Henry
Mayor, of 1048 Hay Street, West Perth, who says :
“ 1 have led a very active life, and my eagerness in
business pursuits led me to neglect my health, with
disastrous results. By not paying sufficient attention to my
diet and the condition of my bowels, my system became run
down. I had to pay the full penalty for such carelessness, for
soon I was the victim of that awful complaint—Constipation. I
felt greatly depressed, and a feeling of dread, as if something
was about to happen, would be continually with me, while
terrible pains would shoot through my head from temple to
temple. A fulness under the heart caused me to gasp, and 1 was
frightened to breathe for fear of this terrible stabbing pain that
would shoot through my body. None of the medicines 1 took
did me any good; In fact, I seemed to be worse afterwards, and life
became a burden. Sleep at night was impossible, and I would
be tossing about In bed for hours. The feeling of suffocation
that used.to overtake me was very distressing.
•< For a considerable time 1 suffered, taking all sorts of medicines and so-called reme-
dies without any good results. A friend recommended me to take Bile Beans, and, more to
please him than anything, 1 did so. Bile Beans gave almost Immediate relief, their action
on the bowels being most mild and soothing, with no griping pains like the ordinary
remedies 1 had been taking. The dizziness and headaches disappeared, and the fulness and
wind around the heart left me. As I continued with Bile Beans my appetite returned, and
the great mental depression was removed. My general health Improved, and after I had
undergone a full course of Bile Beans I was completely cured of all my ills. Now I feel
splendid, being healthy and strong, and able to transact my business and enjoy life.”

The Sunset Roads.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rn HEY run out here through treeless
g wastes and leagues of scorching
sand —
The roads that lead from all we loved to
this, the Exiles’ Land;
Through mulga scrub and saltbush plains,
with blue-bush by the way ;
Where mirages deceive the eye and willy
willies play—
The pathways of a ghostly land, where
always and alack !
The roadways lead away from home- —and
never one leads back!
I know not what strange mysteries pervade
this dreadful land —
I only know that we who know may never
understand !
I onlv know that ruthless Fate remorselessly
contrives
To see that we who take the roads shall
walk them all our lives !—-
Shall trudge them out and trudge them
back —and out and back again—
Till all the roads become the roads of peni-
tence and pain.
We measure distance not by miles, but by
the tape of years ;
We measure life not by our joys, but by our
olden fears.
The years that clotted in the glass —the
pendulum that swung
For ever backward from the time when all
our hearts were young.
The olden fears that forced us down and
filled our hearts with lead
Till sunset skies became our roofs —the
Desert sand our bed.
A thousand miles towards the Dawn the
world is gold and green,
And broad, blue-breasted rivers drone in
sleepy Riverine.
A thousand miles towards the Dawn the
roses blossom red,
And, Oh! the wine gleams brightly neath
the arc lights overhead.
A thousand miles!—a thousand years.
the Sunset sages teach
That what is out of sight and sound is ever
out of reach!
Some trudge because they loved too much —
not wisely, or too well;
Some trudge the roads because they seem
the kindest routes to Hell.
And some there are who never knew a
clinging woman’s love,
God knows! Perchance her sad eyes are
the Desert stars above.
And some there are who keep their thought's
as under lock and key—
And who shall guess their secrets here where
all is Mystery?
The roads shall give surcease of grief to
those whose grief is great,
And friendliness and sympathy and balm m-
They, too, shall give ungrudgingly what all
the world denied —
The -strength to suffer silently—the privacy
of pride. , , ,
And we shall let the world pulse by beyond
the blurring grey — , .
The Exiles of Society who take the Sunset
Way.
I know not what their griefs may be —what
laws they have transgrest;
I only know they tum their eyes tor
ever Furthest West-
I know pot what their secrets are —whaf
darksome depths are stirr’d;
Yet often in the silent night my inner senses
heard —
They heard the things that made me crave
to stretch a friendly hand
To all the men who trudge with Pie the
Roads of Sunset Land.
And I who take the patient Pads with
Abdul and his kind, , ,
What shall my final judgment be when
other eyes are blind?
And shall I leave but to return, as all the
gxIIgs do —•
For none who trudge the Camel Ways have
ever proved untrue. ,
Or shall I seek What none shall hnd, beyond
the Furthest Track —
For all the roads lead out from home — and
never one leads hack!
SUNSET EAND.
B. J. CASSIDY.
Mr. Whymple's Experiment.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE stood brooding over an empty beer-
tankard, handily placed in relation
to the counter-lunch. A sufficiently
commonplace ruin he looked, at a casual
glance, with liis dismal, foolish old face and
disastrous clothes ; yet was there something
distinctive about him. I realised presently
that the arresting feature of his make-up
was his eyes —the intense, burning orbs that
one sees often in fanatics, revolutionaries,
religio-maniacs, political assassins and people
of that sort, and but rarely in bar-loafers.
Detecting sympathy in my gaze, perhaps,
he leaned over and besought a match. I was
struck by his pleasant voice and manner*
He smiled wanly. “You’re wondering how
I came down to this,” he said, waving a
weakly hand to comprehend the fly-infested
lunch, the bar and its frowsy inhabitants.
I muttered something concerning “better
days.” He seized on the banality with the
eagerness of one who, hugging a darling
grief, discerns a likely chance to air it.
“You might doubt it by my present ap-
pearance,” he said, with a sort of shame-
faced pride; “but I was a rich man once.”
He paused, obviously by way of prelude to
something of a dramatic order, and then said
with slow impressiveness: “I am one of the
few men in Australia —in fact, I may say
in the world —-who has been financially ruined
by Party Government.”
If he were a liar, I reflected, he was a
sufficiently imaginative one to merit encour-
agement. If he spoke the truth there should
be a good story in him. I had his tankard
refilled, stood by while he grabbed a wedge
of pastry, and led him to one of the sofas
that rimmed the drinkery.
“Yes,” he mused, with an air of dreary
cheerfulness which I found later was one of
his characteristics; “ten years ago 1 was
a rich man. I had a business in Sussex-
street that brought me in a couple ot thou-
sand a year- i owned a house up \\&n-
roonga way, belonged to two clubs, held the
presidency of our local I reetrade League
(nowextinct),was a prominent member of the
committee of the Northern Suburbs Liberal
and Reform League, and was invariably re-
ferred to by th(> Willoughby Banner, and
similar publications, as ‘our esteemed fellow
citizen, Mr. Arthur Whymple.
“Those were days when mad, subversive
doctrines were in the air. People no longei
spoke with enthusiasm of the fiscal system
of Old England. Even respectable business
men, my own associates, showed a. disposi-
tion to t? ,o at Freetrade as something that
was moribund, if not dead. The Labor party,
backed up, I grieve to state, by a few recalci-
trants of the Better Classes, was striving
might and main to create an Australian
navy as an alternative to the time-honored
plan of hiring British ships and sailors to
defend these shores. The wicked and un-
English system of compulsory service men-
aced the colony. Everywhere one saw the
barriers going down, and mob-rule immi-
nent. As though to cap it all, a number ot
journals started a vigorous assault on that
which I have always held —aye, and still
hold, sir” (and his eyes blazed defiantly)
“to be one of the foundations of Britain s
glory—Party Government. Yes, a consider-
able section was for abolishing Party Gov-
ernment on the grounds that it was (I use
its own wild words) ‘an absurd and un-
businesslike survival.’ Even in my own
right-thinking suburb the virus was spread-
ing. I shall never forget the throb of dis-
may which stabbed me, when, one night, at
a quarterly meeting of the Killara Ladies’
Association for the Maintenance of the
Status Quo, a local tradesman suggested that
‘there might be something’ in the new move-
ment. I closed his mouth pretty sharply,
you may be sure; but the recollection of
the unsavory episode rankled.”
The speaker paused for a space to absorb
nourishment, liquid and solid, and then pro-
ceeded :
“It was about a month after the disturb-
ing portent I have just mentioned, that the
Filet de Boeuf Restaurant came on the
market. The gifted proprietor had made a
fortune, and proposed to retire. I knew
the Filet well, having had many a merry
meal there in my time. One of my clerks
first mentioned to me that it was for sale.
It was with no thought of the scheme
which afterwards developed in my mind that
I turned into my old haunt that day for
lunch. It was full, as usual. But not so
full, I reflected, as it might be; not so
packed with moneyed guests, avid for perfect
food and ideal attendance, as it assuredly
would be under other auspices. It has done
well, I told myself, as I toyed with a cutlet,
under a system which was old and effete
when the Roman Empire was young. How
much better would it not do under one
which is infinitely newer, and more intelli-
gent —a system that is one of the_ highest
expressions of the modern Englishman’s
genius for administration ! In that moment,
sir,” and leaning over he tapped me earn-
estly, impressively upon the right knee,
“there was born in me the germ of my Great
Idea. In my mind’s eye I suddenly saw a
vast eating-place, incomparably fur-
nished, manned and conducted. The wealth-
iest in the land crowded to it, and cheer-
fully paid what prices they were asked. The
prices were enormous, but the management
could afford to demand them, for it held
a monopoly. It was the only private
business concern on earth that had the stu-
pendous advantage of bping run pn Party
CrQvepnment lines!’’
Having paused for a moment, in order to
give me a chance to assimilate his tremend-
ous notion, he went on in more subdued
tonesr
“Before I left the Filejt that d a y? T had
decided to buy it, and administer it on the
lines that have done so much to make the
grand old Motherland what she is. What a
proselytising agency it would be! I reflected
exultantly. What a blistering, raking criti-
cism on the disloyalists and revolutionaries
who are for ever striving jto undermine and
change our matchless old governmental in-
stitutions ! What a standing object-lesson,
to the meanest intellects, in the jvisdom and
usefulness of that which the modern ‘re-
former’—so-called —has dared to criticise!
“I spent the next few weeks realising
securities, interviewing lawyers, issuing in-
structions to chefs, waitei-s and so forth,
and, I regret to say, wrangling violently
with my friends and relations. Men and
women of little faith that they were, they
doubted—for all that they were convinced
Liberals—whether the system which had
admittedly proved such a boon as regards
the business of so many nations and States,
would be equally beneficial in the case of a
private enterprise. However, I soon proved
to them by cold, remorseless logic the ab-
surdity of their attitude. Within three
months the place was mine, and in full
swing under the reformed state of affairs.
“My scheme was simplicity itself. The
basis of it ' was that the restaurant staff
should be divided into Forwards and Backs.
The part of the People—the ultimate Arbi-
ters- —I, of course, reserved to myself. I
carefully selected 28 Forwards. To them I
gave all the best-paid and most honorable
billets. Their leader was Henri, a mditre
d’hotel of cosmopolitan fame. His deputy
was William, wisest and most tactful of head-
waiters. Others who held posts in what I
may call the Cabinet were Duroc, the chef;
Samuel, an English expert in roasting and
grilling ; Michael Harrigan, the door porter ;
and the head pastrycook, one Larozza, a
Viennese Jew. One of the main objects of
the Forwards was to please and impress me,
and so hold their jobs. The chief business
of the Backs, on the other hand, was to
demonstrate that the Forwards were inept
and unworthy, and generally incompetent.
If their efforts in this line succeeded, they
automatically stepped into their rival’s posi-
tions. An irreproachable arrangement, sir,
was it not?”
The merest nod sufficed to start him again.
“Yet, somehow, things failed to run
smoothly. In fact, to be frank, there was
trouble from the start. Part of the duties
of what I may call the Opposition was, of
course, to discredit in every possible way the
holders of the Government positions. They
no doubt kept as well within their legal

“II the Pain Is There-
in the Small of the Back -
Suspect Your Kidneys”
BURDENS LIFTED FROM BAD BACKS.
WEARY is the back that bears the burden of kidney ills. There's no rest or peace for the man or woman who has a bad back. The distress begins
in early morning. You feel lame and not refreshed. It's hard to get out of bed. It hurts to stoop to tie your shoes. All day the ache keeps
up. Any sudden movement sends sharp twinges through the back. It is torture to stoop and straighten. At night the sufferer retires to toss and
twist and groan. Backache is kidney ache a throbbing dull aching in the kidneys. Plasters or liniments won't do. You must get at the cause, inside*
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
Street, Pyrmont, says : “Some time ago I strained myself push-
ing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the effect in the small
of my back. For three solid months I was unable to work.
I was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull pain
through the loins and the kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who recom-
mended Turkish baths, but though I got a little ease, I could
not work. I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and obtained
wonderful relief. I am so much better I can now do heavy
work. I am firmly convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a true kidney remedy, and I never fail to recommend
them among my friends.”
Thirteen years later, Mr. Carroll confirms the above: “I have
been quite free of backache and urinary trouble ever since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me thirteen years ago.
My cure proves that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a
thoroughly good remedy.”
Sydney Proof
for
Sydney People,
Mrs. John Stettler, Sorrell Street, Parramatta, says: “At
intervals during the past nine or 10 years I have had trouble
with my back. This was undoubtedly caused by my kidneys.
The pains were often so bad that I could not sleep at night.
I also had. severe headaches. I was nearly at death’s door,
as my neighbors can tell you. I was a great sufferer, and
had been treated by doctors, and used medicines without suc-
cess. But Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have changed all this.
Since taking this remedy I have felt quite bright and well.
Before I took the pills I could not attend to the children, but
now I can attend to all my duties, and I am thankful for it.”
Mrs. Stettler confirms the above 11 years later: —“I have
been free from backache and every distressing symptom of kid-
ney trouble, and have been in good health ever since Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured me 11 years ago.”

rights as our Party politicians do who at-
tempt, by slandering, abusing, assaulting,
throwing missiles at, and cursing their suc-
cessful rivals, to prove that the latter are
unworthy of their masters’ confidence. And
yet I often, think that the Backs at the
Filet erred in the direction of over-zealous-
ness. They carried the virtue of Party Loy-
alty to excess.
“For example, one of the staunchest and
most valued natrons of the House was old
Sir Herbert Blanky. For years this estim-
able, citizen had been bringing typewriters,
manicurists, his wife’s parlormaids, confi-
dential companions and so forth to No. 3
Private. lioom, and paying with uncomplain-
ing lavishness for the privilege. He arrived,
within two days of our opening, trailing in
his wake one. of the most alluring little hos-
pital nurses it has been my lot to see, and
was, of course, ushered, with due deference,
by William, to his usual retreat. It must
have been an hour or more later that my
ears were assailed, where I sat in my inner
office, by a sound of determined knocking—in
fact, I may say battering—on the floor
above. I hurried up to find a large, stout,
elderly lady rapping furiously with her um-
brella on the door of No. 3. I bade her
desist. To my horror she said, with an air
of calm that hideously belied her crimson
and infuriated visage: ‘I shall not desist,
my good man. I am Lady Blanky. My
husband was shown into this room at 10
minutes past seven by your infamous head-
waiter, William. The wretched old man is
in there now, with a hospital nurse who has
fair hair and dark eyebrows and a large
gold bag, which must have cost 75 guineas
at the least.. If the door isn’t immediately
unlocked, I intend to burst it open.’ Even
as vvilliam and I stood gazing at her, in a
paralysed state, she drew back and pro-
jected a vast shoulder at the frail door. It
forthwith burst open, disclosing Sir Herbert
and his young friend in a state of speech-
less embarrassment and apprehension.
“We never took another farthing of Sir
Herberts money, and the divorce suit which
followed did considerable damage to the
i ilet s fair name. It afterwards transpired
that one of the leading strategists of the
Backs party had telephoned to Lady Blanky
giving full particulars of her husband’s
doings on that fatal night—the idea, of
course, being to blast William’s lifelong re-
putation as an absolutely “safe” waiter. A
legitimate Party move, you may argue, but
one, it seemed to me, which took but little
count of my interests.
“A night or two later an even more dis-
astrous episode occurred. I learned the de-
tails from Henri. The members of our local
ar wa o had,, for years, been among the
most enthusiastic patrons of the Filet—r-were
giving a dinner to one of their number who
had been, as the papers say, ‘elevated to the
Bench. All went swimmingly for a while.
Mr. Blither, K.C.,. was, with many a cheery
quip and sally, dissecting an immense vo'l-
au-vent a dish for which the House was par-
ticularly famed. Suddenly his gaiety fell,
as. it were, dead. So did his jaw. Some-
thing that was almost terror transformed
his face. Amidst an incredulous hush, he
hooked from beneath Duroc’s incomparable
pastry a rat. Delving deeper he produced
another —and yet another. They had obvi-
ously been dead for some time; Henri judged
two or three, weeks. .Poor young Mr. Smythe-
son, the Chief Justice’s Associate, who had
already devoured a fragment of the pastry,
leaned an ashen face over the back of his
chair, and
* * * *
“The company left in disorder, a few
seconds later, and finished the evening, I
understand, in a tea shop. It was, of course,
a Party move on the part of the Backs,
associated with the kitchen staff, to prove
that Duroc was unfit for office. Ethically
speaking, it is, of course, possible to pick
holes in the ruse, just as folks years ago,
used to question the strict honesty and ver-
acity of our revered leader, Mr. G. H. Reid,
in terming his political opponents revolu-
tionaries, robbers and anarchists. But it
has ever been the practice of all true Britons
to look with a lenient eye on things done in
the heat of Party feeling, and I decided to
wipe the episode from my mind.
“Another stunning blow struck us the fol-
lowing week. A more conscientious man
than Harrigan, our hall-porter, you could
not wish to meet. He had been in the Irish
police force for 20 years, and, perhaps for
that reason, held the criminal classes in
peculiar abhorrence. I have reason to think
that Harris, one of the Backs, a cloak-room
attendant and an aspirant to Harrigan’s
position, played a leading part in what fol-
lowed. Harrigan was on duty one evening,
when a well-spoken stranger, who repre-
sented himself to be a Victorian detective,
drew him aside and warned him earnestly
that a middle-aged man who had just passed
inside was one of the most notorious confi-
dence tricksters and all-round ruffians in
Melbourne. Harrigan was essentially a man
of action. Leaping upstairs he intercepted
the visitor, just as he was taking his seat,
and leaning over him, hissed the words, ‘Get
out.’ The man seemed amazed. ‘Will yer
get out, Bull Rafferty,’ asked Harrigan
firmly, ‘orr will I fling ye out?’ As the
other remained immovable—in fact, he
seemed stupefied—Harrigan closed with him
and projected him roughly into the street.
In the course of the action for heavy dam-
ages which followed, and which we lost, it
turned out that the supposed sharper and
desperado was the Hon. Ebenezer Wow, of the
great Adelaide legal firm of Wow, Bloggs
and Wow. Harrigan had to go, and what
with one thing and another, an inclination
arose in me to give the Backs a lease of
power.”
Mr. Whymple paused and pondered mourn-
fully for a few minutes.
“My story is nearly ended, sir,” he re-
sumed, at last. “Sound as my scheme was
in principle, in practice it somehow worked
indifferently. The Forwards, being in Oppo-
sition, naturally took to the tactics which
the Backs had employed in similar circum-
stances. The waiting was rotten. The
reason was that the Opposition at the Filet,
like their prototypes in Parliament, were
chiefly concerned to hamper their rivals in
every attempt the latter made to carry out
my orders. It was a case of the Party first,
and the Country—which was to say, me—
nowhere. As a result of the obstructionist
tactics of the minority, a plate of soup
would often be an hour passing the second
reading—l mean getting from the kitchen to
the consumer. The language the two parties
used about each other, during working hours,
was shocking. It was not unusual to see
the whole business of the House held up
while a leading member of the Backs slang-
whanged one of the Forwards for a ouarter
of an hour or 20 minutes at a time. Things
got to such a pitch at last that my employ-
ees put in about 75 per cent, of utterly profit-
less argument, as against 25 per cent, of
toil, per week. Each side pestered me un-
ceasingly with tales concerning the other’s
criminal habits and antecedents. Had I
taken seriously half the stories that were
poured into my ears I would have concluded
that such of my employees as weren’t illegiti-
mate had parents who were gaol-birds. I
was constantly being assured by. the Opnosi-
tion that those in office were traitors,
untrue to their trust, thieves and trick-
filters. I began to feel as though I were
living in a gaol or a madhouse. A dinner
was hardly ever served without a Back pub-
licly calling a Forward a liar, or vice versa.
At one important function two party waiters
rolled madly on the floor, gnawing each
other’s arms and legs. The staff, instead of
in! erfering, abandoned their duties and took
sides on purely party lines. A batch of libel
actions—made possible by the unfortunate
fact that the doctrine of ‘privilege’ does not
apply in restaurants—resulted in several of
my most trusted servants having to go
through the Bankruptcy Court. Mean-
while the attendance, on the part of the
public, grew sparser, day by day. The
climax came with an occurrence which the
papers starred next morning as-

In the awkward pause which followed I
essayed a few blundering words of svm-
pathy and encouragement? He took me un
swiftly—a note almost of fierceness in his
voice. s

SAID the stranger: “Once had an ex-
_ Perience with a man who was clear-
ing out from his wife. He was stone-
broke, and wanted me to lend him some
money to get away. I” ——
“The mean cur!” growled Harry.
“Eh?” The stranger stopped, and regarded
Harry attentively. “Did you speak?”
•‘I Said he was a cur—a mean cur!”
The stranger flushed. “But you haven’t
heard the details,” he expostulated. “You
don’t know what the circumstances were, or
why he” ——
“I don’t want to know!”
“But how can you”
“Don’t want to hear them, old man.”
“If you’ll allow me,” —the stranger kept
his temper well and spoke smoothly—.“i’ll
explain.”
Harry considered awhile. “He told you his
yarn, then?”
“Yes.”
“And you believed him?”
“Certainly! I knew for a fact that he
was speaking the truth.”
“And how much money did you give him?”
“What he asked for?”
“You don’t —d’ye mean that!”
“Yes, I gave him the money.”
“You did!”
“I tell you I did!”
Harry breathed heavily. “Well, I’m (con-
demned) !” he muttered, and subsided.
We waited.
“I did it,” said the stranger, after a pause,
“because I was sorry for him. I’m still
sorry for him.”
“So’m I,” snarled Harry. “I’m sorry for
him, and” (impressively) “I’m sorry for
you!”
“His wife used to throw things at him,”
pleaded the stranger.
“Good luck to her,” said Harry.
“And he used to throw some of them
back.”
“Th’ damn coward!”
“She threw the tongs at him one night.”
“Go on! Did she hit him?”
“She did.”
“Where?”
“On the forehead,” said the stranger sadly.
“Good shot!” cried Harry, enthusiastically
sitting up and waving his pipe. “Good
Lord! Just fancy a woman with talent
enough to throw a pair of tongs straight
being tied to a man of his sort!”
The stranger sighed. “You’ve struck it,”
he murmured. “I was a friend of the
family, and I liked them both, but they didn’t
get on well together, so I thought it wouldn’t
be any harm.”
“Did he ever pay you back the money you
lent him?”
The stranger hesitated. “Well, no; he
didn’t, and I’ve never been able to pay it
back.”
“Did you borrow it?” (Harry never
knows when to drop the subject.)
“Yes, I did.”
“From whom?”
The stranger coughed and glanced ner-
vously around him. “I trust you gentlemen
won’t misunderstand my motives. I was a
married man, and they were both old
friends of mine. I talked it over with Jane,
and she agreed with me that it was the best
thing that could be done under the circum-
stances. Jane said”
“Your wife said?”
“No,” said the stranger, gently. “Jane
was the name of his wife. I borrowed the
money from her for her husband to run away
with.”
