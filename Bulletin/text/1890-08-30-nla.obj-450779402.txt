AYER’S PILES are unsurpassed as a
remedy for constipation, biliousness, sick-head-
acbo, dyspepsia, Jaundice, and the common

system of malarial poison, and assist in tho
formation of pure, rich blood. These well-
known pills arc compounded of the essential
virtues of the best vegetable cathartics, and
contain neither calomel nor any other deleteri-
ous drug. They may, therefore, be adminis-
tered in all cases v,hero a purgative is needed*
without fear of ill effects. Being sugar-coated,
they r.ro pleasant to take, and their medicinal
strength is preserved for ah indefinite period
and in any climate. They should ho in every

WHO IS
WEAK
ğ
Nervous & Debilitated
Who in his youth has trifled away his vigour of bod v,
mind, and manhood, should consult PROFESSOR
CARL STINE WAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is
still treating with the greatest skill and success all
Private, Nervous and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINEWAY'S success, which has
become so firmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts xst. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines used are
exactly adapted to suit the case, and are compounded
from the purest, freshest, and refined ingredients,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I seek cases where all else has failed,
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, etc.,
can recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in person or by letter, which is
free), Professor STINEWAY, who has re-
stored thousands of sufferers to vigorous man-
hood after all other treatment had failed. It
makes no difference what you have taken, or
•who has failed to cure you. Cases that I accept
for treatment are quickly and permanently
cured.
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS,
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many_forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,,
timid, and lack the power of will and action ?
Are you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of
fainting ; fullness of blood in the head ; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
■ fits of melancholy? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful with your mind continually dwelling on
the subject ? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits ? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation
of the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms ? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single con-
sultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed on
the way to health, strength, and vigour.
All correspondence held sacred. A speedy
and perfect life cure is guaranteed in all cases
I undertake, where doubt exists the sufferer is
frankly informed.
Persons living at a distance who desire
treatment without delay can, by forwarding a
full description of their case and £l, receive
by return of post the medicines required.
Do not despair, even though all others have
failed in your case. No matter what your
complaint may be, call or write—l will cure
you. If you are ill, do not delay IMy vast
experience enables me to guarantee a positive
cure in all cases undertaken. CONSUL-
TATIONS FREE. Medicines sent secure
from observation to any part of Australasia.

READ THIS
Western Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.— Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western'
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

Melbourne have made lightning-like progress, so will

(REGISTERED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD ; OF NEW SOUTH WALES),
Late House Surgeon to the. Great Northern Hospital, Caledonian Road, London,
SPECIALIST in the Treatment of Diseases of the
Reproductive Organs and Nervous Complaints
Dr. PERRY was induced to publicly advertise himself as a
Specialist in this branch of the profession in consequence of the number
of persons suffering from diseases of this nature remaining uncured ; and
this is not surprising, when it is remembered, in consequence of the
general dislike of the profession to undertake these cases, the public
health has suffered, because the majority of persons advertising to treat
these diseases, and calling themselves Doctors, Professors, etc.,
Are Neither the One nor the Other,
and exist chiefly because DULY QUALIFIED MEDICAL PRAC-
TITIONERS have not occupied the field.
Patients can, therefore, readily see the advantage of being treated
by a practitioner who has gone through a thorough Medical, Surgical and
Anatomical Training in the best hospitals ; and the Doctor argues that,
although it may be considered contrary to antiquated medical etiquette
to so advertise, yet he is promoting the usefulness and the dignity of
the profession more by searching out and relieving this class of disease,
than by leaving them severely alone to the care of men who, however good
their intentions, have neither the opportunities or advantages of a regular
gedioal training to become acquainted with the best methods of treating
these complex forms of disease.
I!
3Dr-
Will be happy to advise persons suffering from these
diseases, and as, in many cases,
Nothing but the observance of a few simple directions
as to Self-Management
is required to place the patient in a healthy state, all who
are in any way affected should consult him, and thus have
the benefit of his advice and experience.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 30, 1890.
“ Trusts.”
From the days when the stronger savage
assailed the weaker savage and wrested from
him the spoils of a laborious chase, there has
been no change, up to the present hour, in
the spirit which has actuated the relations
between man and man. Methods have been
qualified, but the oppressive and predatory
spirit survives. The solitary ruffian of the
woods learned to associate with himself other
ruffians, and to appreciate the advantages
derived from combined action. Few single
individuals, no matter how superior in
muscular force, in determination of character,
and in cunning, were capable of overcoming
any two men whom they might encounter or
desire to plunder. But a gang of 40
desperadoes, operating in unison and availing
themselves of the advantages of surprise,
were capable of laying under enforced con-
tribution a community or population of many
hundreds. If the spoils gathered by such a
band were equally partitioned, each member
of it would be enabled to enjoy the ravished
property of scores of individuals, a plunder
acquired with comparative immunity from
resistance or retaliation. The hoard which
had cost months of persevering toil, and,
when agriculture began to be practised, some
degree of foresight and patience to accumu-
late, could be snatched and appropriated in
one hour of rapine. But in every group of
human beings, for whatever purpose as-
sembled, there are always a few individuals
who display a superiority of whatever
qualities may be essential, and who succeed
in obtaining a concession from their com-
rades of more than an equal share of what
they might acquire by their united efibrts.
And there has seldom failed to present him-
self one in particular, developing and dis-
playing a capacity superior to all others
whose talents were recognised as essential to
the fullest realisation of the general objects,
and to w horn was conceded a still larger pro-
portion of the common stock.
* * #
By a convention naturally emanating from
such conditions, the peacefully laborious
submitted formally to the exactions of the
actively predatory. It was found more ad-
vantageous to surrender habitually and with
docility a portion of the fruits of industry,
than to have all wrenched from them at un-
certain but recurrent and inevitable intervals,
with the aggravation of ruthless slaughter
and malicious destruction. From such brute
naturalism has proceeded the earliest
organisations, tribes, with their inferior
chieftains and supreme chief, and thence
by progressions which History has fully
displayed, nations with monarchs, aris-
tocracies, and priestly castes. The pervading
instinct has never flickered and never
altered. The sovereign has continued to be
the man who got the biggest share of the
plunder of the people ; the aristocracy, the
lieutenants who secured the next largest
proportion, and so on till the almost indis-
tinguishable line is reached which separated
the plunderer from the plundered. As the
scale of spoliation expanded, concurrently
with the art of organisation, the plundering
class was constantly augmented, with a cor-
responding diminution in the shares of the
participants. This process has now, in most
European communities, reached a stage at
which the whole organism has become un-
sound. The monarch and the aristocracy,
with the civic functionaries who are essential
instruments of their exactions, press so
heavily upon the industrial class in every
European country that for several centuries
a disposition to revolt has been so obvious
that standing armies have been essential to
intimidate and, if necessary, to slaughter.
Armed mercenaries were at first tolerably
reliable to those ends. Their lot could be
rendered apparently, and perhaps really,
preferable to that of the industrials so long
as the practice of abandoning to military
rapine the entire populations of the scenes
of their operations, and of delivering con-
quered towns to sack, prevailed. When
Alva entered the Netherlands, for example,
with nine thousand choice troops, there
marched with the column two thousand
courtesans to keep them in good humour,
and the conquest of a city converted each
soldier who had been grumbling about un-
paid arrears of stipend into the glorious
master of handsful of gold and jewels, and
the Sultan over a bevy of shrieking maids
and groaning matrons.
* * *
But the diffusion of information and en-
lightenment consequent on the discovery of
the art of printing has discredited the savager
methods of war-waging. The mercenary of
to-day is but a wage-slave, like his toiling
brother, and when provision has been made
for the plunder required by the superior
orders, and the horde of civil agents, further
exactions have been impracticable to the
extent which would be required to confer
upon every soldier the luxurious appoint-
ments of a Pretorian guard. Hence violent
methods of extortion have been almost aban-
doned, in favour of the outwardly milder
and not less efficacious system of organised
chicanery and constitutional imposture.
In recent times, force having become dan-
gerous and discredited in all spheres
of predatory activity, has been superseded
by cunning and fraud. The absolute
suppression of that personal representa-
tive of the era of force—the monarch—in
some countries has not seriously alleviated
the condition of the exploited classes. In
the United States of America, where there
exists no monarch, and practically no stand-
ing army, and in the French Republic,
whence monarchy has been expelled, the
material condition of the people is not per-
ceptibly better than in Great Britain or in
Germany in a greater degree than can be
accounted for by the comparative recency of
settlement in the one case, and by the re-
markable fecundity of the. soil and favour-
ableness of the climate in the other. Thus,
even where the “ first robber” of the melo-
dramatic period of history—viz., the Sove-
reign—has been reduced almost to the im-
potent s' ate of (! ian t Pagan, in ‘ ‘ The Pilgrim’s
Progress,” enfeebled and only able to gnash
his teeth in unavailing rancour, fresh ag
gressors beset the highways of human pro-
gress.
# * *
Astor, of New York, draws from the
Republican inhabitants of that city a larger
revenue than the Czar of Russia enjoys for
his personal gratifications. Vanderbilt
derives from his railways a greater income
than the Emperor of Germany is permitted
to appropriate to himself. The Duke of
Westminster exacts more from the small
section of the population of Great Britain
who pay him taxes under the name of rent
than Queen Victoria is enabled to derive
from the entire nation. In the aggregate
the masses of every civilised nation pay
tribute to the new order of capitalist plun-
derers infinitely more than they contribute
to the old order. The latter are under an
obligation to render some services in return
for their exactions. They defray the cost of
the machinery of the State. Much of that
machinery has, beyond doubt, been devised
with the express object of providing sine-
cures for members and dependents of the
plundering class. But some of it would be
requisite under any circumstances. So much
service and return, at any rate, the people
receive from the old order of exploiters.
But the new order make no return
whatever. They pretend, indeed, to dis-
charge the functions of organisers and
superintendents of industry and commerce.
But their services in those capacities would
be fully compensated by a one-thousandth
part of the riches which they extort. Of
late, however, their condition has com-
menced to become somewhat uneasy and
precarious. Competition among themselves
begins to make serious inroads upon their
profits. Till very recently they have
managed to keep going comfortably by the
aid of two devices. By securing to them-
selves the fruits of other men’s native
ingenuity in the form of labour-saving
machinery, and by steadily contracting
their wage-sheets, each has been able to meet
the diminution in the price of the commodi-
ties they deal in. But the latter of these
resources has found its limit. Labour, by
organising, has brought into exercise a
method of checking the downward course of
remuneration. And where Labour, too
desperately disabled to organise, remains
helpless as yet, the wage-rate has touched
the bottom depth of possible reduction.
When, in certain industries, female labour is
obtained for 16 hours a day for four or five
shillings per week of remuneration—the
wretched recipient ekes out the balance
necessary to support life by walking the
streets—it is not conceivable that human
exertion can be bought cheaper. The next
stage would be for women to live by prosti-
tution and work 16 hours daily for no wage,
but in consideration of being exempt from
summary execution.
- # * *
-•'Confronted by this difficulty, capitalists
nowadays have conceived the idea of reverting
to the priinary methods. They are arranging
to combine in gangs, so as to plunder to
more advantage. The notorious “ Boss ”
Tweed adopted this conception a score of
years ago in a crude form, which, by its very
cssenl ial i haracter, aptly illustrated the origin
and derivation of the idea now become a
common commercial resource. He schemed
to make himself and his associated rascals
master of an existent Government. Therein
he would find the machinery of exploitation
already in operation. All that he needed to
do was to work it to his own advantage.
Having succeeded in obtaining control of the
civic government of New York city, he simply
appropriated a considerable part of the
revenues for himself and his familiars. This
was merely assuming the role, and the per-
quisites, of a monarch and an aristocracy.
But as the established laws did not recognise
this usurpation, and Tweed could command
no armed force adequate to enable him to
subvert the laws and revolutionise the civic
constitution, he failed to consolidate his
position. For a season he was King of New
York; but when his subjects revolted,
thereupon he was merely a detected thief.
The laws were stronger than the robber.

The moral of Tweed’s enterprise and
collapse lias not been thrown away upon the
predatory class. Their schemes to-day are
carefully concocted so as to operate within
the sanction of existing codes, or, at any rate,
so as not to expose the operators to legal
punishments. The ancient laws which res-
trained and scourged forestalled and monopo-
lists have been superseded, repealed, or
otherwise have fallen into desuetude and out
of the Statute-books. Such as remain un-
repealed, among other absolute enactments
are capable of being evaded by the refined
ingenuity of latter-day conspirators. Com-
binations of capitalists to plunder consumers
by artificially raising the price of com-,
modifies, by the old device of creating an
artificial scarcity by withholding stocks, and
the new plan of arranging for a restricted
production, are no longer punishable. Or,
at least, if punishable, the penalties are em-
bodied in old statutes so long inoperative
that the conspirators either believed them to
bo non-existent, to be forgotten, or to be
evasible. Hence, in the United States, so-
called “ Trusts ” multiply day by day. In
Great Britain, ‘ ‘ Corners ” are concerted. The
other day salt was the article it was designed to
use in order to tax the entire population for
the profit of a band of capitalist conspirators.
Yesterday it was chemicals. To-day it is
Labour. A “ Trust ” with a capital of eighty
millions sterling has been announced with
impudent effrontery, the declared object of
which is, not to make Labour buy some
particular commodity dear, but to constrain
Labour to sell the only article of value it
possesses exertion cheap. The result
Would be, of course, identical in either case.
It makes no difference whether Capital com-
pels Labour to give ninepence-worth of
labour for sixpence or sells it sixpence-worth
of salt for ninepence.
* # #
In countries newly settled, such as Aus-
tralia and America, a mode of extortion
much in favour with Capital is to obtain
exclusive control over some natural oppor-
tunity, or general necessity, under pretence
of a benevolent and enterprising anxiety to
be of service to a community. Under this
category are comprised such enterprises as
the provision of tramway-service for the
city and suburbs of Sydney, and the supply
of water to the town of Broken Hill. In
each of these instances public convenience
and accommodation is the pretence, and ex-
ploitation the intention. In the first case the
design of charging higher fares than are de-
manded on the lines as managed by the
State, is not even disguised. That would
afford profit at one end. Reduction in the
number of employes and contraction in the
rate of wage is unquestionably an unavowed
intention. The practice of a similar syndi-
cate on its Melbourne tramway service fur-
nishes unanswerable testimony to that effect.
Thus two distinct sections of the public
would be levied upon : those who use the
trams and those who work them. Each of
these sections would become tax-payers to
the Tram-Syndicate. Now the tram-users
constitute in reality the entire active popula-
tion of the city and suburbs, or very nearly
so. By bringing them under contribution
the tram-monopolists would occupy essen-
tially the same relation to the populace as
used to be held by a baron of the Middle-
ages, who, from his feudal castle, con-
strained an entire community to pay tribute.
* # *
The instance of the Broken Hill Water
Supply is even more flagitious. In this
case the adventurers coolly proposed that
the Legislature, whose prime function it is
to protect the people from oppression and
fraud, shall confer upon a handful of schemers
a monopoly of the very rain from the skies,
which may fall upon an area of two hundred
square miles of the earth’s surface, whether
it falls upon land the property of the State,
upon land the property of individuals, or
upon land the property of the schemers,
This gift of nature is to be, by the people’s
representatives, jn defiance of natural laws
and of natural justice, by a monstrous per-
version of the very essence of legislative
functions, handed over to a Ring, with spe-
cial leave to that Ring to sell what Provi-
deuce freely, but in that district not too
bountifully, gives, at famine prices. No
P r uj e °t is too shameless, no device too scan-
. lous, for capital to initiate and to adopt,
111 pursuance its greedy quest after
801110 “right to lay the people in
general under contribution. But every
. y the comprehension of the people widens
Sj’ as P °t principles, and apprehends their
a Pphc.ation to particulars. Ihe time is not,
we believe, very far remote when proposi-
tions which have plunder for their motive,
Wl | be recognised with unfailing accuracy
anCl promptitude the instant they are
niooted, and when their instigators, their
participants, and especially their hireling-
sponsors in the Legislature will be visited
the swift and severe retribution of
public disgrace and universal contumely,
bhree the public intelligence becomes fully
seized of the baleful tendency and plundering
intention of pseudo benevolent schemes of
such character, it will not be long before
there w *b be engrafted upon the Constitu-
01b fundamental clauses absolutely invali-
dating an y concession of such nature, even
though the Legislature should by negli-
S ence ’ by cajolery, or by corruption, be
g u ilty of giving it the colour of legality.
The Federation of the World.
It is one of the favourite beliefs of humanity
that some day in the distant future—in the dim
old age of the earth—there will dawn a joyous
millennium when liberty and peace will be
universal and the Federation of all mankind
will make man a little more worth preserving,
and the world a little less conspicuous a failure,
than they are to-day. It is hoped that in that
shadowy era which is to come national hatreds
will die out because all nations will be assimi-
lated, and political strife will be brought to an
end because political boundaries will be obli-
terated ; and sectarian animosities will become
extinct, because the thousands of angry sects
which jar and wrangle in all parts of the earth
will join together and live up to some simple
creed and will cease to consign each other to
perdition because they are unable to agree about
the road to Paradise. The Parliament of
nations, of which Tennvson wrote before he
became old and misanthropic and a baron, is to
be a great congress of peace, and even the pre-
judice and hostility which is-born of difference
of language is to be obliterated by the spread of
a universal tongue, so that races will no longer
lie enemies through that prejudice which is born
of isolation and ignorance. And it is claimed
by many enthusiasts that the world is even now
distinctly tending towards this glorious climax
of civilisation, that there are visible signs of a
leaning towards peaceful arbitration in place of
war, and that man, in this enlightened age,
does not long to take his brother’s scalp and
hang it up in his wigwam with quite the same
ferocious longing which pervaded the length and
breadth of his frame in the days of old. The
great desire of humanity, before the period of
commercial intercourse and missionary enter-
prise set in, was to go out and kill somebody,
but this craving for dissension and human brains
is understood to be suffering a gradual process
of elimination ; and through various agencies,
among which cheap calico and the Gospel are
pre-eminent, it will ultimately pass away, and
then the long-dreamt-of brotherhood of man
will be within measurable distance at last,
* * *
The Christian doctrine of peace has been
spreading for nearly 1900 years, and considering
the great end which is before it, it is gratifying
to note that it keeps on advancing. Its pro-
gress, in the early days of the Church, was slow
and precarious, and more than once it seemed
in danger of being wiped out by aggressive
Paganism; but ultimately the arrogant Con-
stantine took it in hand, and proceeded to kill
anybody who declined to accept the faith which
forbade violence, and ever since then its pro-
gress has been rapid. Russia underwent a
process of universal conversion in a single day
at the bidding of the reigning Tsar, and if any-
body declined to accept the peaceful doctrines
laid before him he was probably knouted and
then beheaded—anyhow, ho left no traces in
history. Western Europe accepted the same
grand creed, partly by persuasion, partly by
more or less vigorous compulsion, and has since
done good service in spreading it throughout
the earth. The Maori or the Indian who
declined to pray got involved in political com-
plications and was shot instead, and the scanty
remnant of the tribes have accepted the doctrine
of peace lest something worse should happen to
them; and throughout the greater part of the
globe the theory of human brotherhood is being
carried every day by men who are able to bring
down anybody who objects to be a brother at
1000 yards and upwards. 1 f civilisation can only
stand the strain, it may abolish war at last by
killing everybody who declines to arbitrate,
and smother national hatreds by putting a head
on any race or nation which refuses to love its
neighbour ; and, so far as affection can be im-
planted with a big gun and an explosive shell,
and the tender flow'er of human sympathy be
cultivated with a club, no effort is being spared
to bring about the great day of Universal
Federation,
* * *
Unfortunately, the civilisation which is to
bring this millennium to pass—if there ever is
any millennium—is itself an ephemeral thing.
It always tends downwards towards the chaos


below. The day that a nation begins to pro.
otoss is also generally the first day of its decay
The Roman who conquered the Avorld Avas the
rude barbarim Avith a hut beside the Tiber, and
hi lost his power and his conquests through
being civilised and refined into the gilded
driveller of the Greek Empire, Avho died at last
of knowledge and imbecility and incurable old
a <re. The same process has ■ been repeated a
dozen times until the present day, when the
Russian —the howling barbarian of the first
century transplanted into the nineteenth —is the
bugbear of Europe, and threatens ere long to
tread down the old civilisations of the West,
and start the world afresh. The progressive
nations of that continent have spent all the long
ages of the Christian era in formulating the first
rudiments of a theory to make life worth having,
and the prospects are that they will not last
long enough to make any use of the knowledge
thus acquired. A thousand ages might possibly
suffice to teach the world the advantages of
universal peace and union, if any nation cared
to undertake the task, but long before that
period the teachers would be extinct and the
races which Avere learning the lesson would have
died and carried the rudiments of their new
knowledge Avith them to the grave. An<l, nnve-
over, man has no time to waste on so slow a
method, and it is a shorter process to teach the
uncivilised millions the blessings of tranquillity
and liberty by blowing up any person avlio
won’t be tranquil, and hanging the individual
who desires his own kind of liberty instead of
the sort that is offered to him. And so the
world Avill progress toAvards Federation until
the boiler bursts, and barbarism Avill move on
towards extinction till the barbarian rises and
declines to be civilised to death any longer, and
the grand theory of universal peace and union
will probably wind up in universal Avar and
chaos.
# * *
The era of universal peace Avill never be
brought about by violence, neither does it seem
likely that it Avill ever be brought about in any
other way. What the uncivilised world has
learned of the blessings of union and universal
brotherhood it has been taught by the SAVord ;
and knowledge so acquired does not amount to
much. The chances are that it would never
have been acquired by any qther means, and
yet, having been acquired in the only available
fashion, it is not worth having. The human
capacity for rising to a civilised condition is
painfully limited, and the capacity for falling
from it is practically infinite. The spread of
knowledge and enlightenment has been com-
paratively rapid of late years, because the
apostles of culture and Christianity have de-
veloped an unexpected facility of extirpating
unenlightened races ; there has been no a vide or
general diffusion of culture, but merely a rough
and ready process of butchering those peoples
Avhich the Avorld was in too great a hurry to
improve or elevate. Judging from what little
remains of the Australian blackfellow, the Red
Indian, the Kaffir, the Hottentot, and other
tribes in similar circumstances, civilisation is
not contagious, and if there is ever to be a
millennium these nations need to be killed
off as a preliminary effort. But, unhappily,
civilisation has brought up at last with a shock
against one or tAvo A r ast aggregations of semi-
barbarians Avho are apparently too numerous to
be killed, and too tough to die a natural death,
and there the process has come to an end. The
European lias never learned lioav to civilise any-
body ; his methods have merely been those of
Mr. S queers who walloped any boy who failed
to assume a cheerful aspect; and, therefore, if
a peaceful Federation of man is ever to be
brought about, the Chinaman and the negro and
various other obstructions have got to bo killed
off as a preliminary. And, unhappily, this is a
somewhat large order, and probably long before
it is completed the European himself will have
fallen from his present high estate and Avill also
Avant to lie wiped out as an obstacle to progress
and enlightenment. And, for that matter, the
European is remarkably poor material at the
best out of Avhich to construct a political and
social millennium, and it is probable that even
the most advanced apostle of Federation would
require to be abolished before Federation Avould
be possible.
* * *
Even if the world should realise its dream of
universal peace and concord, it Avill probably
get tired of it in course of time, and revive the
ancient chaos, and start the whole slow process
of ...evolution all over again. If it abolishes
monarchy in all its forms and acquires uni-
versal freedom and equality, the chances are
that in some future era of senility and mental
decay it avil! resurrect the ancient incubus and
commence the weary struggle for liberty afresh.
If it shakes off the tyranny of Capital, and
abolishes poverty and strife, there is no possible
guarantee that all these venerable burdens will
not be replaced upon its shoulders again by its
own act, only to be removed by the long effort
of centuries of misery. Rienzi gaA’c to the
Romans of the middle-ages the freest constitu-
tion Avhich the world up till then had ever
known, and the citizens of the new common-
wealth butchered him to make way for the
restoration of their ancient tyrants, France
sacrificed one republic for the sake of Napoleon
the Conqueror, and another for Napoleon the
Imbecile—the man of Mexico and Sedan. She
Avas cheerfully prepared to sacrifice a third for
Boulanger —the smallest, meanest charlatan of
his age, if that feathered warrior had afforded
her the opportunity. Even progress grows
wearisome at times, and liberty and prosperity
become monotonous. If Lucifer became tired
of Paradise, it is not improbable that the world
may become tired of the millennium, should
that blessing ever come its Avay.
* * *
If any one desires to ask under these circum-
stances Avhat the world is striving, for it can
only be replied that it is striving for anything
it can get, and getting it anyhow it can. It is
striving for the emancipation of labour, for the
destruction of all manner of old-established
monopolies and abuses Avhich have made the
Avorker a slave and a pariah, for the abolition of
Avar and monarchy and aristocracy and land-
lordism—in short, it is striving for the great
millennium, with a perfect consciousness that it
may never come, that it may not be up to
sample when it does arrive, and that in any case
it is not likely to stay. It is only the things
th it are not worth having that are immortal,
and the survival of the fittest is an exploded
superstition. The Athenian lasted only for a
day and the Chinaman goes on for ever. The
philosopher dies out, but of the pawnbroker there
is no end. The Nihilist is hanged, and the Czar
keeps on living. If the Czar were worth pre-
serving he would probably be dead, and if the
Chinaman were anything else than a menace and
a curse he would be extinct. And if the mil-
lennium of human liberty be worth striving for
it is not likely to last long when it comes, for
nothing is indestructible on earth except cor-
ruption. But still it is better to have possessed
liberty and lost it than never to have possessed
it at all it is better for the human race to be
regenerated, with chaos to come after, than to
be a Dead Sea of humanity without a hope or a
future. The old proverb which the worn-out
voluptuary of Jerusalem passed off on an
ignorant world needs to be 1 turned upside
down ; the dead lion is better than the live dog
after all; or if it is isn’t, then it was only a
second-hand lion when it was alive, and crawled
into the realm of zoology by the back door.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Plea for Property.
The trouble in the Australian shipping-trade
has roused the Melbourne Argus to drivel a
good deal in its oavii uncertain, inconsequent
fashion concerning the rights of Capital and the
inherent cussedness of Labour. The unsubstan-
tial ghosts of the Barnacles have pervaded its
columns, and demanded to know where the
country is going to, and the aged organ has
formed itself into a committee of one Avith itself
in the chair to consider the point, and return a
verdict. And, as the result of its labours, it
presents a resolution to the effect that the com-
panies ‘ ‘ have a right to do what they please Avith
their own steamers,” and that any interference
on the part of the employes is an act of out-
rageous presumption which ought to be put
down. We second this motion cordially, and
urge the Argus to go ahead. The companies
have a perfect right to do as they please with
their oavii steamers. They have a right to
unload at all hours of the day or night without
being interfered with, or called upon to pay
0A T ertime, or subjected to any other obscene
annoyance on the part of the common herd—so
long as the steamer unloads itself; but if it
can’t do that, then the question is not one con-
cerning the vessel—which does belong to the
company —but it concerns the men, who cer-
tainly do not, unless they like to. Also,
the companies have a right to pay what
Avages they please on their own steamers,
providing they are paying the Avages to the
steamers ; but when they are paying a human
being avlio is his own property that person has
a perfect right to kick if he doesn’t think he is
getting a sufficient return for his labour. INen
Avhen the trouble reaches such a point that
officers and crews abandon the vessels simul-
taneously, there is no suggestion on the part of
the most rampant trades-unionist that they
should take the steamers along with them. The
oAvners can do as they like with their oavii, and
if they can run their ships with non-union crews
or without crews, they are at liberty to do so.
And if the Labour organisations should succeed
in preventing neAv crews being shipped to re-
place the old ones, they are still looking after
their oavii business in the strictest sense of the
term. The companies are left to do whatever
they think best with the steamers, which are
their exclusive property, and the men take their
own course with regard to their labour, which
is their personal asset, and each party is attend-
ing to its own affairs. The Argus’s ideas date
back to the time when liberty consisted of the
right of every man to wallop his own nigger,
and it has never yet learned that the ownership
of a vessel does not include the ownership of
the hands and brains without which the vessel is
merely a mass of waste material. Yet the unions,
whose action has roused the bile of the super-
annuated paper to such an extraordinary height,
are merely taking the course which the Argus
itself recommends—they are doing what they
please with their own property. And even in
the present deplorable event of a general
paralysis of the shipping industry they-are still
following the counsels of this solemn monitor.
The organ of Capital called on the owners
to lay up their property rather than give in, and
as the men have laid themselves up they are
following this injunction to the letter. But
whatever quarrels arise, or Avhatever angry
passions may be aroused, the right of the com-
panies to do what they please with their own
must be respected, and if any trades-union or
other body is found unlawfully interfering with
this right we trust that body may be suppressed
by all the available force of the law. Also, if
any decayed newspaper or other organ of re-
spectable stupidity is found endeavouring to
suppress the right of the employes to do as they
think best with their own, we ask that the out-
raged law of property should fall upon it
right off.
A Tribune of the People.
If the legislators of New Zealand are inclined to
give that grand old patriot, Sir George Grey,
a fair show Avhile he is alive, instead of erect-
ing a soulless brass obelisk to his memory when
he is dead, they might abstain from talking-out
his Electoral GoA r ernors Bill when it appears on
the paper next session. For tAvo successiA r e
years that measure has had to go to the Avail
because Mr. Henry Smith Fish, the incendiary
paper-hanger, of Dunedin, wanted to jump on
the ear of his enemy, or because the Skinflint
party desired to talk for 40 days and 40 nights
about the necessity of taking a shilling a week
off the Parliamentary charwoman’s income, and
meanwhile Sir George is growing very old and
his Bill bids fair to accompany him to the
grave. He was the only Democratic Governor
who ever struck New Zealand or any other
colony, and during his tempestuous career his
proceedings frequently made the Colonial Office
Avish that it Avas dead. He got into a bad habit
of sympathising Avith Maoris and other loav
characters, and he manifested a sinful disrespect
for old traditions, and treated red-tape Avith
derision, and wasn’t so solid as he ought
to have been on a great number of
sacred things. Also he had a misguided
tendency to set to work and do anything that
wanted to be done, whereas he ought only to
have made a minute indicating that perhaps it
might be as well if some British noodle ap-
pointed a Commission to find out how not to do
it, and then sent the document to London by
gravel tram, and had it stowed away in a
pigeon-hole. He Avas no more fitted to drivel
washily over foundation-stones and tea-fights
than J ulius Caesar was to take in plain sewing,
and he utterly loathed the boot-licking parochial
Mayor who wanted to read him an ungramma-
tical address without, an “ h ” in it. So at last
he briefly hinted that the Colonial Office had
better find someone there who was common
enough and stupid enough to be a Governor,
and he commenced a ucav career as Premier of
Nbav Zealand, until his Avant of reverence for
old tradition broke his Ministry tip. Then he
became Leader of the Opposition, and scared
his followers away by his democratic ten-
dencies and his utter scorn of party tactics
and other small SAvindles, till at last in
his old age lie is a lonely iconoclast Avith
hardly a follower in the House, and
spends his declining years in capsizing Avorn-out
idols, and making himself offensive to everybody
Avho has an axe to grind at the country’s ex-
pense. He has learned by dismal experience
that a nominee. Governor is expected to be
merely a species of gorged mud-turtle slumber-
ing in a swamp, and as the only statesman in
Australasia who can expound, from his own
personal knowledge, the inner flunkeyism and
imbecility that is required of that imported
ruler, his opinions on the subject are at least
entitled to respect. And therefore the poli-
ticians of Ncav Zealand might at least lend a
hearing to his proposal that the colony should in
future elect its own nominal head, and if it is.
necessary for that purpose to sit on Henry
Smith Fish, then let that obtrusive paper-hanger
be sat upon at once. And even if the dreary
Fergus has to be squashed, and Taiavh anga. to
be smothered in the midst of his eloquence, and
if Mitchelson’s muffled monotone has to be
put down by force of arms in order that the
aged Tribune of the People shall have a slioav,
the result will still be Avorth the sacrifice. It
is easy to grow another Fish, and Fergus can
be replaced at short notice, and Mitciielson
Avouldn’t be badly missed anyhoAV ; but when
Sir George Grey falls out of the ranks a demo-
cratic Avhite man will have gone, and men of
that kind are scarce.
Dr. Cockbnrn’s Collapse.
The CoOKBpRN (S.A.) Ministry died the other
day, partly of internal weakness and partly of
the Progressive Land-Tax. It was a avcll-
meaning organisation and filled with good inten-
tions, and its great mission was to burst up the
vicious system of land monopoly, and make the
absentee, Avho is draining the Avealth and energies
of the colony, do something for his livelihood.
It ne\ r er had vigour enough to pile nearly so
large an impost as it wanted to on the land-
speculators, and foreign syndicates, and all the
great fraternity of earth-swallowers who have
stolen the best of the country's territory and
done nothing in return, except sell out at an
immense profit and carry away the proceeds,
but in a humble, hesitating fashion it resolved
to make them contribute some, infinitesimal
fragment of their plunder to the national
revenue, and it collapsed in a small, apologetic
Avay as the natural consequence. It did not
fall far, for. mentally it was a short, stumpy
concern, and its head Avas very near the dust
all along. If it had only recognised the great-
ness of the principles for Avlneh it was con-
tending, and made a good fight in the democratic
cause, eA 7 en its ultimate failure might have been
the beginning of a great reform, but it fooled
itself aAvay over a lot of insignificant side-issues,
and died miserably in a squabble about the
break of gauge on the border, and the rusty
condition of the Defence Force, and other ques-
tions of like importance. If Napoleon had
been kicked to death by a mule on the morning
of Austerlitz the end could not liaA’e been much
more ignominious. The fate of the Cockburn
Ministry was the same as that of almost every
other Cabinet in Australia which has threatened
to deal fairly with Capital. For some reason
or other the Australian people seem unable to
comprehend that lawyers, squatters, and land-
grabbers, however wildly democratic they may
be in theory, will sooner see the nation in
Gehenna than legislate against their own hoary
monopolies, and it is a cold day when these three
great parties cannot raise a majority to block
any measure that looks like genuine progress
in any of our parliaments. The Cogkburn
Government was doomed from the start, but
the ignominy of its complicated muddlement
was that it allowed itself to drop to pieces over
a small parochial row, instead of dying for the
only principle it possessed that Avas Avorth
dying for. It had a chance to appear before the
country as having fallen in leading a forlorn
hope, and then it fell instead through a pain in
its stomach, or some similar prosaic ailment.
The consequences are very rough on a party
Avhich deserved better fortune. It is one thing
to holler for a leader who came down fight-
ing, and quite another to holler for a man who
merely came down because he Avas born down
and had never got completely up since.
Judge Hood and Divorce.
Victoria’s new Divorce Act is already getting
tangled up and unworkable through the opera-
tion of that mysterious natural law which always
requires that an Australian statute shall never
mean what it says, but shall always arrive by
hidden ways at some concealed signification.
The first object of the Act was'to give relief to
any Avoman whose husband had deserted her for
a certain length of time, and as the husband
avlio deserts his Avifc seldom leaves his address
behind him -especially in those cases when he
lias gone off' Avith somebody else’s Avife and
taken her husband’s furniture—it a\ as provided
that the actual service of a summons might be
dispensed with, and the proceeding be adver-
tised instead in tlic district whore- the. absentee
was last heard of. Then an ingenious and
fathomless person named Judge Hoon got hold
of this simple-looking proviso, and resolved that
there was an unexpressed intention away down
in the abysses of the Act that no person should
be divorced “without his knowledge,” no
matter though he might have left his home and
gone to reside on the source of the Nile, or.in
the wastes of Spitzbergen ; and, therefore, un-
less the plaintiff could prove satisfactorily
that the defendant was almost sure to see
the advertisement announcing that a ease
had been started against him, this mode
of substituted service could not be allowed.
And as no plaintiff can prove that her
vanished husband is almost certain to see
the printed notice unless she actually knows
where he is, and as not one deserted wife in forty
possess this knowledge, else she would follow
him at once, and seeing that if she owned the
required information there would be no need of
substituted service at all and the defendant could
be sued in the usual way, the Divorce Act, so far
as Judge Hood is concerned, has gone to wreck.
About 19 petitioners out of every 20 are dis-
missed with instructions to go forth and roam
this great inhospitable world till they find out
where the old man has gone to, and if he has
married an ignorant female in Timbuctoo, or
is urging the picturesque camel over the ranges
of Cashmere, she is to tramp round till she dis-
covers him so that she can advertise her
intention of getting a divorce in a paper which
is likely to come under his depraved and
rheumy eye. Meanwhile the other Judges
can’t find that smothered signification in the
Act, but Mr. Hood is positive that it is there ;
so apparently the only thing to be done is to
pass a new Act declaring that the old one meant
exactly what it said, instead of meaning what
Judge Hood thought it ought to have intended
to mean in a concealed or surreptitious sort of
way that wasn’t perceptible to the naked eye.
Japan has started business on a new system
with a constitution and an elective Parliament,
and it is proposed that one of the first duties of
this body shall be to “ establish a new basis' of
morality suited to the conditions of the country. ”■
There is a certain amount of solid sense in this
suggestion, for the European code of morals is
such a lamentable misfit that it is of very little
good to anybody. The parson who preaches it
and expounds it and lives upon it, ends by
eloping with a borrowed female to ’Frisco,
where he lectures “to men only.” The Social
Purity Society which enforces it, gets a
cold in its eye through looking, through the
keyhole of some respectable single lady, and
finds itself cast adrift —an atom with an
inflamed optic wandering loosely through an
unsympathetic world. The politician who
makes laws for its encouragement gets impaled
on the spikes of a back fence while trying to
climb over and interview a Cook, and is mys-
teriously connected with the dead infant which
is found in the suburbs. Everybody esteems
the Ten Commandments, and skirmishes round
after somebody elsc’s wife. Everybody values
the moral law, and nobody cares a hang for it.
And, therefore, what is the good of a code of
ethics which everybody admires, and a good
many snuffle about, and nobody attends to? If
the Japanese Parliament can find some “basis
of morality ” which is suited to the conditions'
of the country, it will have made a good start.

Anyone in the confidence of the New South
Wales railway-employees will speedily arrive
at the conclusion that Chief Railway Commis-
sioner Eddy (once a “ working-man " himself) is
most unpopular with his manual-labour subor-
dinates. Nor do the latter appear to have any
special love for Commissioner Oliver. The
complaint, which we instinctively feel to be
true, is that both these gentlemen, however
good may be their intentions, have an unhappy
knack of eternally emphasising the existence of
a big gap between themselves and their under-
lings. The objection is not so much to what Mr.
Eddy says as to the manner in which lie says
it. The bluff Mr. Fehon, although possessed of
at least as much force of character as either of
Ins colleagues, is the only one of the Commis-
sioners who is fit to act as official spokesman to
men who have worked under the conditions
which have obtained and which in the main
must at all risks preserved in this country.
Mr. Oliver has been accustomed to deal with
servile clerical labour, and Mr. Eddy comes to
New South Wales, a land of sturdy and out-
spoken democracy, red-hot from an aristocratic,
low-waged country, where men still doff their
hats to those who buy their labour.
* * *
If Commissioner Eddy means to be a suc-
cess he must not be half so touchy. The State
pays him £3OOO a year, a stipend which should
go far in helping him to endure even the
roughest of criticism and the windiest of
blather. It was the custom of Frederick
the Great to allow throughout his dominions a
freedom of speech most remarkable for such an
era. Seeing one day a large crowd gathered
round a placard posted high on a wall, the
King rode up and found the placard to contain
a most atrocious slander directed against his
own sacred person. “Take that down, ’ said
the King, “and place it where it may be easily
seen by all. I wish people to say what they
like, fori mean to'do what 1 like.” Mr. Eddy,
so far as the New South Wales railways are
concerned, has been given the power of doing
pretty well what he likes, and with that he
should be perfectly satisfied. When a member
of Parliament talks about “ strangling ” Mr.
Eddy, the latter, if he thinks the threat worth
taking notice of, should simply send notice to
the police.
An unwashed individual, possessing a handful

Ur to now no comment has been made, save in
this journal, concerning the motto adopted by
the N.S.W. authorities for the regimental flag
of the N.S.W, Cadet Corps. As every one
knows, there exists an ancient motto, “Pro
rage saepe, pro patria semper ,” which, being
interpreted, runs “Often for the king, always
for fatherland.” It is the latter half of
the motto only which has been selected, all
reference to the king having been carefully left
out. This very pointed omission is a sign of
the times —and a most artful sop to Australian
Republicanism. As a counterpoise, the chief
flag—“ The Queen’s Own” (!) —is the Union Jack
in rich silk, having on either side a massive
gold-embroidered crown, the pike surmounted
by the Royal crest. There are broidered on
this flag no words. None are necessary. The
standard eloquently says for itself “ Pro rege
semper. ”
It is not yet known, except to his friends and
business intimates, that an individual convicted
four and a-half years ago of a big New South
Wales Land Office fraud and sentenced to ten
years’ gaol, has already obtained his freedom.
The reason assigned for his release will possibly
be the familiar one of 44 ill-health. ’ Not so
very long ago another most influential (and
wealthy) person was convicted of having forged
the name of a dead man to a promissory-note
which he endeavoured to palm off upon the
deceased’s executors, and was sent up for seven
years ; but in two or three years after his little
misfortune the eye of the public rejoiced at the
sight of their dear old friend tooling an irre-
proachable buggy along the main streets of
Sydney, with a rakish tilt- in his well-brushed
belltopper and a big cigar in his mouth. The
authorities, it appears, had been persuaded that
gaol was not good for this gentleman’s health.
The moral of all this is quite obvious. When a
convict is to have his sentence remitted, either
in whole or in part, let the fact be gazetted a
month in advance, so that the nasty, suspicious
public may satisfy itself that the real reason
why mercy is extended is the culprit’s ill-health,
and not the fact that he is in some way or other
related to or mixed up with a member of Par-
liament.
“ Bbitons never, never, never shall be slaves.”
Of course not. Yet the cablegrams tell us that
the British Government insists upon forcing
upon thousands of its subjects a religion they
despise by compelling them to pay the salaries
of clergymen in whom they don’t believe, and
whose ministrations they never attend. A late
advice is :—“ Great difficulty is being experi-
enced in collecting the tithes in Denbighshire.
The tithe-collectors have to be assisted by
troops.” Now, boastful Anglicans, did Rome
ever do anything more brutal than this ? The
Church of England, “by law established a
comfortless heathendom to most Welshmen —-
collects its gospel extortions, its unwarranted
loot, at the point of the bayonet; descends to
the highwayman’s method of forcible robbery.
Rob on and burgle awhile in the name of religion!
The doom of the Established Church is sealed,
and it will never have another ‘ 4 Monarch
Defender of the Faith.” Disestablishment will
first occur in Wales and Scotland, and the end
will not then be far off.
+
The Australasian steamship owners and their
associates have now fairly thrown down the
gauntlet. They have decided to hold no com-
munication with anyone who speaks of 4 4 black-
legs.” 44 Blacklegs” they will term 44 free
labour.” In a word, they will call Black
44 White.” In other respects also there is to be
no mincing of matters. They will employ no
officer connected with the union. They are going
to break the union, and will, at the end of the
strike re-employ no unionist whose place they
have succeeded in filling by a traitor to the
cause of Labour. The Bulletin assumes that
this can only lie done by importing labour to
replace the unionists. The time has therefore
distinctly arrived when federated labour should
make a definite move to make its friends and
enemies in Parliament declare themselves. Let
a resolution be submitted to the New South
Wales Assembly affirming that the Govern-
ment shall instantly bring in a Bill to make
all contracts to labour in New South
Wales, made beyond the seas, null and void;
let the labour-party circularise Parliament to
the effect that every member is expected to be
in his seat to vote on the resolution—and then
let every man who votes against it, or who
refuses to vote, be remorselessly opposed by the
solid labour-vote until his dying day. That is
the test-question of the present hour, and the
best means of bringing the labour question into
the Parliamentary arena. Australian labour
can be subjugated by the importation of foreign
blacklegs just as easily as it could be subjugated
by the importation of horse, foot, and artillery.
Two white lepers were last week found in New
South Wales—one being a State-school boy of
14 years, and the other a young man of 28.
They have been sent to the leper-hospital at
Little Bay (where there are ten other lepers) as
additional testimonies to the blessings of Chow
labour. Now that leprosy has got a fair start
in the mother colony, it may be just as well to
publish for general information a condensed list
of the symptoms of the hideous disease. The
kind of leprosy oftenest seen*in Australia is
characterised by cutaneous tubercles which
appear in different parts of the skin. They are
hard, rough, and numerous, and terminate in
ulcers which penetrate to the bone and cause
the separation of parts of the body, the toes and
fingers' for example, dropping off. These
symptoms are accompanied with a languor in
motion, dullness of the senses, change of the
voice, and general lethargy. There are three
sorts of leprosy—the scaly, the crustaceous, and
the tuberculous, and one of the best ways to
escape leprosy is to grow your own vegetables.
Sirs James Macßain and Matthew Davies
have arranged a farewell feed to Gov. Cabington,
to be given in the “Queen’s Hall,” Melbourne,
on Sept. 30th. Pabkes has consented to play
a leading part in this greasy demonstration of
K.C.M.G.-devotion to the Throne, and the
Baron is expected to mention that Australia is
“extremely lucky” to get a man like Lord
Jersey. After which Hopetoun will pipe-out
a fervent prayer that he will live to earn the
same measure from Victoria that Cabington
has won from New South Wales, and proceed-
ings will terminate in a general outbreak of
back-scratching. The Cabington banquet
might well be accepted as read, and the daily
newspaper-reports issued immediately. Why
should the Baron, who is certain to feel
bilious at the time, have to sit out such a mum-
mery when he would much rather be enjoying
a quiet yawn in private ?
An Australian Labour Federation proposes that
all its Parliamentary representatives shall
occupy seats on the Opposition cross-benches —
in other words, all the Federation’s labour
members are to declare themselves ‘ ‘ agin the
Government.” “If,” remarks the Mackay
(Q.) Standard, “the Federation is as perfectly
organised and as strong as it would like the
public to believe it is, it will return candidates
for every seat, and the country will see the
rather startling innovation of a Parliament com-
posed entirely of Oppositionists. You can’t put
out a Government which has no existence, and
the whole House being solemnly pledged to bo
Opposition cross-benchers, a most bewildering
sort of deadlock would ensue. Political econo-
mists have never, so far as we are aware, anti-
cipated such a position.”
Concerning the Marine strike, originating
in the desire of the steamship officers to
affiliate with the manual-labour and other
trades-unions, the Melbourne Argus, in a
recent leader, brays thus: “The officers
would lower their position by placing them-
selves on an equal position with their sailors,
and the men would consider themselves superior
to their officers, and general insubordination
must ensue.” This sort of offal makes us feel
more and more tired. Identity of interest is
the only perfect guarantee against insubordina-
tion. Rebellion can never be fostered by the
removal of party feelings. Once establish a
common bond of interest between all hands on
board, and the misdeeds of an individual will
be promptly punished by unanimous condemna-
tion. No officer can lower his position by
admitting himself to be simply a man, instead of
arguing that he is a specially-designed product
of creation. The Argus arguments are simply
unworthy of consideration.
Me. John See, M.L.A., chairman of the Aus-
tralian Newspaper Company, has addressed the
S. M. Herald with reference to the public in-
sinuation of a labor-representative that he (Mr.
See) had, as a steamship-owner, used his news-
paper influence against the strike. Mr. See
flatly denies that he has spoken to an editor of
any Sydney newspaper, or any writer connected
therewith, or written, or caused to be written,
one word in connection with the matter in dis-
pute between the steamship-owners and those
on strike. Mr. See must nevertheless per-
ceive that as in the ordina y course of
human nature no man can be an impartial
judge in his own paramount cause, so no news-
paper editor can fail to be influenced or embar-
rassed by the known opinions and interests of
his paper’s financial controllers. The present
writer once felt this very acutely on assuming
the conduct of a paper in North Queensland,
which organ of public opinion, unfortunately
for its literary tone, had fallen into the hands
of two rum-retailers residing in adjacent and
rival townships. In publican M'Lellan’s town,
where the mines were prosperous, drinks were a
shilling each. In publican O’Hoolan’s region,
where the bottoms had fallen out of the claims,
drinks were sold at sixpence—as a counterpoise
to the attractions of the reefs “ beyant.” The
political, religious, and alcoholic policies of the
two proprietors were utterly at variance, for
M‘Lellan was a fine old Ulster Tory, while Mr.
O’Hoolan had brought both his religious and
political opinions from Cork. And when we
found out that M‘Lellan had got plenty of
money behind him and held a coxxtx'olling in-
terest in the North Queensland Reefer and
Miners’ Friend, how did we plump for slx-illing
drinks and the pious and immortal xnemory of
King Billy !
Let the workmen of New South Wales calmly
ponder over the following impudent piece of
brutality, from the Sydney Echo, run by the
colossally rich Fairfax family :
In Australia we seem to have reached the limit where
high wages can be paid and leave a profit. Yet the use
that is made of the money is to form a fund to foment
trouble and disaster. We see the men who are now out on
strike-respectable workmen, but who will never be any-
thing else than labourers in the race for life. The very
ease with which they lend themselves to the purposes of
agitators shows the quality of their mental capacity. But
the world will never become communistic, and there will
ever he the hewers of wood and the drawers of water.
Stern necessity has taught this truth, and it remains to be
taught to each successive generation. Our own country
has already adopted the only amelioration of this condi-
tion in giving education-free and of the best—to every
child, rich and poor alike, which will enable each indivi-
dual to take that place in life to which his mental calibre
entitles him. But for the rest—the manual labourers—
who have not and will not learn of the better things of
life, to them may only be given the means to support life
in comfort. Anything over and beyond that will but be
used for the injury of mankind, as the present state of
things most surely testifies.
Education, even when superadded to high in-
tellectual capacity, cannot place meix on the
same social plane ; equality of opportunity must
also be offered. Whexx withheld, the money-fat
imbecile has the power if xxot to throttle, at all
events to hobble, the gexxixxs. The men who
have the greatest share of the world's good
things have not, as a rule, acquired that posi-
tion through any virtxxe, either physical or in-
tellectxxal, of their own. It is a lie to say that
‘ ‘ education exxables each individual to reach
that place ixx life to which his mental calibre
entitles him” ; old John Fairfax came to Sydney
as a coxxxpositor ; he had brains, certainly,
and education to some extent, and the
opportunity being offered he became owner of the
big daily, which now chiefly represents unearned
increment. Such opportunities arc not often
presented, and it is not too much to say that
were any of the surviving Fairfaxes now placed
in the paternal primary position, granting them
the ability to uphold it, centuries of labour,
could life be granted to them, would not raise
them to the place finally achieved by the founder
of the family prosperity. “There will
ever be the hewers of wood and the drawers
of water.” True, good Echo, but in those
latter days those who hew wood and draw
water will do so not as now because other occu-
pations are closed to them, but because un-
pleasant occupations are handsomely paid. At
present, metaphorically speaking, the reward of
the hewer is chips, of the drawer, water; but
the day cometh when these despised workers will
live in a manner befitting the men whose exis-
tence is a public necessity. The man whose idea
of hard work is the signing of cheques won’t
have such a good time then, however. Anyhow,
the Echo gives its argument away when it
asserts that to ‘ ‘ manual labourers may only be
given the means to support life in comfort. ’
The employer’s idea of what should constitute
“ comfort ” to his workers unfortunately differs
from their idea; therefore discontent, therefore
strikes.

When the London Society of Authors gave
a dinner the other night, George Augustus Sala
and his wife indignantly walked out because they
considered their place at the table not important
enough. Concerning this matter a London writer

habit of deferring a good deal to him on that ac-

It is a pity that “ Fedora” wasn’t put on
sooner at Sydney Criterion, for at present it looks
equal to another month. Failing to give early
notice, the Governors of New South Wales and
Tasmania, who went there the other evening, had
a doubled joy in viewing the performance from
the back row of the circles across the bare shoul-
ders and bald pates of Sydney’s hon-ton. The
respective merits of the two leading performances
have been the fruit of much discussion recently.
Admitting that Mr. Titheradge’s is the more
finished, the more coherent performance, it must
not be forgotten that Ipanoff is the easier person-
age to handle, for throughout his conduct is
straightforward, his motives above-board, and
lie is not, until the very close, distracted
by conflicting emotions. Fedora, on the
other hand, has no sooner recovered from
one emotional paroxysm, than she is attacked by
another of different character, and sometimes
becomes the very shuttlecock of several conflicting-
passions at one moment. Throughout, these
transitions are so abrupt, as to lend the character
a spasmodic tone unless in the hands of one to the
manner horn —a kindred spirit, in fact. Of late
Mi s Achuroh has shown a desire to snatch ap-
plause, to the detriment of ensemble, at inoppor-
tune moments. Applause is as the breath of the
player’s nostrils, but when not obtained legiti-
mately it is detrimental to the recipient, who
must eventually become intensely artificial, tricky
and stagey.

Despite the strike, theatrical business is
good all round in Sydney, and “Paul Jones,”
after a seven-weeks’ run, will be withdrawn only
to give the public a chance of seeing Nellie Stewart
and Marian Burton handle the name part in Yon

bourne. The fair entrepreneur will step into the
breech once more on Saturday night, but when
the other candidate for the bifurcated opportunity
is to assume the rdle, is not known publicly at
time of writing.

At the Matinee performance of “A Doll’s
House” at Sydney Criterion, last Saturday, the
front five rows of stalls, fenced off for the occasion,
were filled to overflowing by members of the pro-
fession, whose hearty and discriminating applause
must have been peculiarly grateful to their actively-
employed fellows. The stalls and circle were
crowded long before the curtain went up, and the
matinde was a distinct success, artistically and
financially.

“Hero and Leander,” contrary to expec-
tation, filled Melbourne Princess’ with money and
enthusiasm on Saturday night. The circumstance
of any classical play being first produced before an
Australian audience was in itself remarkable, and
when the risky experiment proved to have been
carried out with such a perfection of detail, in
scenery and effects, as is seldom seen, the success
achieved was honestly deserving of the generous
demonstration which endorsed it. To the artistic
management of Bellew, equally with the efforts of
painters Brunton and Hennings, the glory of
“Hero and Leander” is mainly attributable. Soul
has been lavished upon the setting of this beauti-
ful show, and the episodes that run most danger
of degenerating into the ridiculous are elevated
into tender suggestions of the sublime. No thought
of failure appeared to daunt the spirit of Satur-
day’s performance. Everybody seemed in earnest
and at ease, and the ancient Greeks—-some of
whom, by the way, looked like the Ancient Order
of Druids—conducted themselves with a classic
composure worthy of a great occasion. The fore-
going rhapsody is intended for real jam.

“Hero and Leander” is an interesting,
sensuous, dramatic love-story, all told by a few
minutes after 10 p.m. The first act—lively, leggy
and sacred-musical—deals with the dedication or
Mrs. Hero Potter to the service of Venus-
Aphrbdite Solemn rites are perpetrated by Mrs.

without the old legend to guide them everybody
surmises that poor Bellew is a goner. And when,
after a lovely sunset on the stormy water, that
indomitable lady-killer is observed to be cresting
the billows, with his tongue hanging out as
' signal of distress, a hundred palpitating
girls in the dress-circle are prepared for
the worst. His side-stroke weakens, the
breakers splash up into his quivering nostrils,
and flood him with memories of green fields, and
of his deceased mother, and, finally, one broad
billow lands his corpse upon the pebbles at Mrs.
Potter’s feet. The drowning is a realistic bit of
business. On Saturday the fatal wave slipped its
surface, exposing to view the deal board upon
whose bosom Bellew had been boofed along, yet
the audience didn’t smile. The spell of a poetic
situation was upon them, and they knew the
waters wouldn’t dry up so clumsily next time.
Just here the hard, virtuous priest sneaks on with
his virgins and orders Bellew to be engulfed back
into the place from whence he came, whereupon
Mrs. P. leaps violently over a precipice, and the
clinging forms of the lovers are seen to be ascend-
ing from their watery grave as the trouble ends.

Ibis impossible to say immediately whether
“Hero and Leander ” is an elegantly-worded
play, for Mrs. Potter’s delivery of blank verse
leaves little of its meaning upon the mind, while
others chop their speeches into line lengths or for-
get to speak up. Evidently, however, the author
is something more than a mere ponderous com-
piler of dry sentiments. If any or many lines are
bad, as they might perhaps appear in print, no
doubt tney might have been a blank sight verser,
and the writer’s name merits a mention on the
programme in addition to the simple announce-
ment that the play was “specially written for
Mrs. Potter.” “The Merry Wives of Windsor;
was specially written for Queen Elizabeth, yet it
is usual to chip in a reference to plain Bill Shake-
speare, anyway. No matter. Mrs. Potter acts
(as apart from her talking) very nicely the
character of Hero, and Bellew is the ideal Leander
both afloat and ashore. Sass, too, is quite a classic
revelation as the High Priest; a trying Quasimodo
kind of part is well done by Boulton, and the rest
assist a little towards making this novel entertain-
ment good enough to carry the last three weeks of
the Potter-Bellew season to a triumphant finish.

“The Parvenu,” at the Bijou, promises to
make a deeper impression than any other of B.
and B.’s Sydney successes produced in Melbourne
during the present season. The comedy has a
good democratic motive, and it is noticeable that
sundry disparaging references to “blue blood,”
or, more particularly, to the snobbery associated
with that ancestral myth, are received here with
heartier applause than fell upon the ears of shud-
dering aristocratians in London at the time when
Edward Ledger instituted a new order of stage-
hero. “The Parvenu,” as now seen, is an almost all-
round improvement upon the original Court Theatre
representation. The natural beauties of No Man s
Land have grown and mellowed like Anson’s con-
ception of the central character. Ledger is a
more likeable embodiment of hard cash than he
used to be, more buoyant in his vulgarity, and less
likely to “improve ” himself into the real cad who
ultimately succeeds in getting Tummy’s legs
under his mahogany and dies of a surfeit of greasy
satisfaction. With an exception in disfavour of
Lawrence, who resembles a bilious crow rather
than an inflated bart., the others suit their places
down to the ground. Misses Homer, Emma
Temple, and Battle Browne; Percy Lyndal and
Boueicault (in the part originally played by his
brother-in-law, Clayton) constitute the others, and
can share a fervent blessing amongst them.

All last week “Fun on the Bristol”
enabled the management to hang glad tidings,
printed on cardboard, outside the Opera House
entrances. Why this familiar medley of art and
tom my-nonsense should be a periodical boom in
Melbourne is not quite clear. Even Widdy
O’Brien loses something of her eccentric charm
after a few years, and the new variety items are
not of a ‘lofty nature. Sheridan warbles a
ballad in praise of ready money bookmakers,
who, it appears, can bet longer odds than
the totalisator “if they are put to it” which
Heaven grant they may be, as soon as possible.
Three black-faced geniuses likewise drop into
sporting poetry, and unite in a touching descrip-
tion of how “the favourite is laying last,” as
though the srallant popular fancy were a hen.
What is the use of State schools while talented
artists mortify English grammar thus ? However,
the public seem to revel in this balderdash, and it
evidently makes no difference in the long theatrical
run.

Changes are impending at other houses.
“The Lucky Lot” may keep possession of the
Royal for another week, but audiences are thinning-
down, and the anxiety to see two or three circus-
horses effect phlegmatic jumps over a gate is
diminishing like a quart of strawberries before a
delicate girl, when no young men are near. The
Alexandra has already announced “Alone in
London a solid, comprehensible melodrama —
for Saturday, and the Halls, Waxworks,
Oyclorama, &c., are pegging along with more or
less success. The Vic., by the way, has lowered its
prices.

George Darrell considers that of all his
dramas, “ The Naked Truth ” is most remarkable
for wealth of “ literary merit.” It is in this work
that George has supplied his heroine with at least
one immortal line, the immortality being attri-
butable to the fact that Robert Browning antioi-
pated our only dramatist, and wrote the line first.
“ I was so young : I had no mother : God forgot
me, and I fell ” (G. Darrell and R Browning).
“1 loved him So ” was unfortunately interpolated
into the Australian version, if we remember
rightly. It never occurred to George that a noble-
minded heroine wouldn’t think it necessary to
offer the excuse that she loved “him” so. He
was wrong to go one better than Browning.
* * *
“Hero and Leander ” is now advertised
to start a quarter of an hour later than on Satur-
day‘last, “in order to meet the wishes of the
fashionable audiences that visit this theatre.”
Fashion seemingly objects to commence walking
home with a wrap round its high-toned head
before 10.30, or else Mrs. Potter is afraid of fend-
ing Fashion earlier away for fear it might think it
hadn’t taken out a full five shillings’-worth.

At Melbourne Princess’ it is against regu-
lations for floral tributes to be handed up by the
leader of the orchestra, so the dudes who come
along with bunches of roses for la belle Potter have
to throw them at her fair head from a private box.
We don’t know whether it is contraband of the
statoots to leave pink, perfumed missives for
Bellew with the stage-doorkeeper.

A comedian, now in Australia, tells us a
story of how, when the Prince of Wales and his
Alexandra sat in the stage-box of a theatre
where he was engaged, the company played only
to that limited portion of the audience who could
not see into the royal box, for royalty engrossed
the attention of all the others. In fact, royalty
played for the benefit of “loyalty,” for did
“ Tummy ” smile or his wife simper, then a broad
grin went round, and when they laughed, gad-
zooks, the house was convulsed. But the crown-
ing stroke of grovel was made when an actress
with nez retrousse came on the stage; after giving
her one look, our future king turned to his fair
spouse and pressed upwards the point of his good
old Guelphic proboscis with his forefinger; five
seconds later, half the house imitated the action.
What a miserable lot of Liliputians we are in this
world !
** * *
George Darrell was recently persuaded to
favour somebody with a two-column interview,
and in the course of half-a-mile of conversation he
explained that he considered “The Naked Truth”
as being the best dramatic effort which he ever
inflicted upon the public without suffering severe
physical damage and battery. But he adds more
regretfully that “ the truth was too plainly told —
the moral too pointedly drawn,” and, therefore,
he at last withdrew this undressed tale from the
public eye. We are glad to have this explanation,
for, as a rule, the chief objection to George’s
dramas is that everybody is killed except the devil
and the scene-shifter, and why the scene-shifter
isn’t killed too we never could ascertain. Also the
villain looks as if he had slid eight miles on his
ear over a rough road ; and the heroine appears as
if she had swallowed a tombstone with a mournful
inscription on it, and the epitaph had got fixed in
her vitals; and the second murderer grits his
teeth monotonously and says that a “ Time Will
Yet Come,” but it never does ; and the other lady
calls upon tl]e fifth or sixth scoundrel to “ avaunt”
and he won’t do it; and the boss ruffian is per-
petually telling an innocent maid in white that at
last she is in his power and the bottom falls out of
his assertion two minutes afterwards. These and
eighteen more are the principal drawbacks which
have attracted our attention, but it seems that
“The Naked Truth” fell from quite a different
cause. It was too naked for the public taste, and
as the audience wanted their truth with its pants
on a disagreement naturally ensued.

The new theatre to he erected next the
Victoria Coffee Palace, in Pitt street, Sydney, is
at length to be proceeded with, the amended
designs having been completed and a contract for
the building let. It is now said that the new
temple will be named “The Garrick.” Why not
“The Brooke?” That wbuld “go on for ever.”
For Heaven’s sake, let us' at last have something
original.

The changes of programme.at the Adelaide
Royal by the Comic Opera Company have been
frequent enough, and audiences could not com-
plain of monotony, and business therefore has
been remarkably good. “The Pirates of
Penzance ” was well performed for three nights,
Elsa Sherwin making her first appearance with
the companv as Ruth. In Cellier’s operetta,
“ Charity Begins at Home,” Billy Elton scored im-
mensely. “ Princess Ida ” was repeated one night
to please vice-rovalty, and the presenceof Hopetoun
and his Countes”s, in addition to theKintore party,
brought the usual heavy train of Government
House followers. “La Mascotte”was rather a
slovenly performance, and but for Billy Elton’s
gagging and huge joking the opera would have
crone extremely flat. “lolanthe, ’ and repetitions
of “ The Yeomen” and “The Mikado,” will finish
the season, and make way for John Lawrence
Toole, who appears on 30th August.
At Poverty Point.
Dear Bulletin,—l have received a notice cut from
your paper, saying that I have realised my interests in
South Africa for £24,000, and am going to run an opera
in London for a year at my own expense. Will you
kindly flatly contradict both the above stories. Firstly,
I have not parted with one of my interests in South
Africa, as I am too firm a believer in the future of that
country. Secondly, my opera of “ Isidora” has been ac-
cepted for the Avenue Theatre, London, by the manage-
ment, and instead of my paying a penny towards its
production, I simply receive a percentage on the receipts,
and, of course, should the opera prove a failure, it will be
withdrawn in the usual course. Thirdly, lam still send-
ing out companies to South Africa, and am even now
negotiating with a “ star” who is at present in Australia.
Trusting you will-insert this, as the paragraph mentioned
above is calculated to do me harm, inasmuch as your
journal is widely copied by the London papers.—l am,
yours, &c., Luscombb Seaeelle. London, 11th July.
The proposal to import a military Guards’ band from
England to Melbourne has gone bung. No money to spare
for such a “ long-felt want.”
Fanny Liddiard again injured her knee in Adelaide, and
as it was still weak from the New Zealand accident, the
doctors ordered her to return to Melbourne. It was
feared that the limb might have to be amputated.
Charley Warner will be back again in Australia in about
a year’s time.
Gerald Boothby, a young Adelaide author, is—it has
been stated—writing a comedy for George Rignold.
Boothby composed an operetta which was performed with
fair success at Adelaide Government House before the
Hallos.
At Irving’s “Macbeth” readings (10s. a head admission)
in St. James’s HaM (London), he reads from a desk on one
side of the stage, while Ellen Terry, on the other, picks
up the thread whenever Lady Macbeth has to spin off the
plot.
Alexander Arrow-smith, or, as he is known to the pro-
fession and theatre-goers generally, “ Bill Ryan,” the old
melodramatic actor, a chief supporter of Brooke, Ores*
wick, and other big men, and partner at various times
with B. N. Jones and Johnny Hydes, is living at Abbots-
ford (Vic.), where he spends his time growing pumpkins
and peaches of gargantuan dimensions. He may tread
the boards again, however. His wife, Mrs. W. Kyan, is
one of the best “old women” in the colonies to-day. The
Ryans are a theatrical family—three of the children being
members of the profession. One is Teddy Ryan, of Bland
Holt’s Tragedy Co.
Stead writes originally of the Ober-Ammergau Passion
Play, which mightily influenced him. He mentions that
40,000 Jews were crucified, outside Jerusalem, by Titus,
and yet their blood all fell as upon granite. How, then,
did one crucifixion, of an obscure, poor voung man,
shake the world? The Passion Play actors include the
local publicans, waiters, and everybody, St. John is a
well-known waiter, and the tourists called him with
“ Come here, John 1 Glass o’beer.”
One Hart writes to a Melbourne paper on the unreason-
ableness of the strike, because the real working man is the
brain-worker, &c., &c. He instances the poor aotor-r,
and listen to what this wretched grafter does, according
to Hart: Rehearsals 10 to 5. acts Bto 11, studies 12 to 3 1
Moral: The actor also should strike.
Talking of vinous actors on the stage, Cooke, the trage-
dian, was once hissed by a Liverpool audience, when he
came to the footlights hissing out—“ Men of Liverpool 1
every brick in your accursed city is cemented with the
blood of a slave.”
Fanny Kemble writes that the vainest woman she ever
knew' w’as Lady Cook. At 90 years old Lady Cook invited
Fanny to admire her lovely sculpturesque shoulders in her
dressing-room, but the maid said, “ La, for shame, mum 1”
and flung an antimacassar over the reliques. This Lady
Cook was a kleptomaniac. She stole a pet guinea-pig
from a poor working man’s door, took it in her carriage,
and sold it to a turnpike man a few miles further on.
A Melbourne musician, who died lately, was pious, but
stern necessity drove him to play in the theatre orchestra
nearly all his life. It recalls the story of a well-known
German opera fiddler, who never raised his eyes to the
stage, and was once introduced to a prima-donna, before
whom he had rasped 10 years, without ever looking in her
face. Perhaps he used to look at her—er —feet. Who
knows ?
In consequence of the giddiness prevailing amongst the
members of a certain opera company, the divorce-court is
likely to be troubled shortly with at least two most in-
teresting suits.
That forgiving Irish comedian, “Romeo” Murphy,
writes us from Port Said forwarding the programme of a
Fourth of July entertainment given on board the Oroya,

Alice Dunning Lingard will play in ’Frisco shortly. She
may come on to Sydney.
It is said that Manager Aronson’s American comic opera
company, with Lilian prima donna, arrives in

Tolstoi says that love is only the result of over-feeding.
There’s some truth in that, but an American says that it
don’t hold good all round, for the lady-skeleton in a dime
Museum has fallen in love with Succi, the fasting man.
According to Galignani, when Jean Richepin was
reading his play, “ La Glaive,” at the Comedie-Francaise,
a gentleman who overlooked his MS. was surprised to see
“ your legs” written at the opening of each act in large
letters. Richepin, who, when reading, crosses his legs,
had made this note to remind himself to change his posi-
tion in time to avoid cramp.
Alice Shaw, the whistler, probably discomfited by the
success of her rival, Mabel Steverison, has gone to Peters-
burg to whistle “ Little Annie Rooney” to the Czar.
How would “ Mr. James Brown-Potter, of Texas,” do

Mrs. Langtry is still seriously ill with pleurisy.
In the interest of African travellers the followdng addi-

Clement Scott, William Archer, Moy Thomas, and
others who slated Charles Wyndham’s farcical produc-
tion of “ She Stoops to Conquer,” not being sent “ com-
plimentaries” to a matinee performance at his theatre
soon after, paid for seats in the pit, and Wyndham then
added insult to injury by returning them the amount in
postage-stamps.
Every dramatic paper in America, save one, the Mirror*
is owned by a theatrical management.
A farce-comedian named “ Buck Daly ” has won the pie-
eating championship of America by eating five large pies
inside ten minutes.
Just to encourage, the local journalists, Edmund Finn,
theatrical critic on Melbourne Daily Telegraph, was sent
for by the Sydney Royal people to make some alterations
in “6hilperic.”
Mr. John Donald’s place as manager to Mr. J. L. Toole
has been filled by Mr. George Lee, lately with Charles
Warner.
J. P. Macdonald, late of Her Majesty’s, Sydney, is very
ill in Melbourne, and his place is filled by L. J. Lohr. The
vacancy left by the latter in the Potter-Bellew ranks is
filled by the oalled-back-from-Colombo Twining.
BertWillison, manager of Prank Brown’s “ organization
gigantesca,” thereby meaning circus, now doing big
business in South America, lately married, at the British
Consulate, Buenos Ayres, Fredericia, daughter of Bill
Fredericks, circus-proprietor, once down in old Jem
Newsome’s circus, where he married Newsome’s daughter
(if we remember rightly), the mother, probably, of
Fredericia.
A lately-fledged Melbourne paper asserts that Anson’s
Fitzjohn Hall in “ The Balloon ” is a “ character study ”
of a Collins-street celebrity. It may be a character study
of, but it is certainly not a character study from the
celebrity in question. Anson played the part in Sydney
nearly eight months ago, and, as a matter of fact, the
actor depicts a type, and no especial individuality.
Charles Holly, the clever minstrel comedian, known so
long in connection with “Tommy” Hudson and Tom
Buckley died at Newtown, Sydney, last week of Bright’s
disease, at the age of 43. He came out to the colonies
first in ’(39 with Frank Hussey. He leaves a widow and
two children.
Lilian Rivers, an American actress of the few-olothes
brand, who some time ago created a sensation by escaping
from the Bethany Female Cottage, Kansas, and going on
the stage, has been ass enough to have a half-carat
diamond in a gold-setting countersunk into one of her
front teeth.
Robert Kennedy has been doing good “ biz ” at Rock-
hampton with his “ Twa ’Oors at Hume.
Lily Dampier is engaged. To her pa, as leading lady,
you say. Yes, certainly; but this is another sort of
engagement. She is about to marry Mr. Watkin Wynne,
Alfred’s right-hand man. ’Twas ever thus: —
We never reared a lovely bud
To glad us with its sw'eet perfume,
But some assertive “cuss ” would come
And button-hole the full-blown bloom.
The Marlowe Memorial performance, in London, a few
weeks ago, was contributed to by many professionals, in-
cluding Sara Bernhardt, Justin H. M'Carthy, M.P., being
deputed to escort her from the carriage, with his best
French. He fetched her in, as he thought, all muffled up,
but was surprised that his glib lingo found no response—it
was Letty Lind dressed for a dance.
At the Theatre Francais, Paris, all the laundrying of
the troupe is paid for by the management, for stage
clothes, even to the petticoats, and so on, worn by the
ladies. The management also pays for the purchase of
everyone’s stage-clothes, and supplies the private ward-
robe of actors who have only £l2 a month and under.
We were edified by a conversation in a tram the other
night. Theatre-party was coming home from seeing the
lady star and gentleman star. Mamma was at one end of
the carriage, two daughters at the opposite end. Said
one to the other “ I wonder if he is very fond of her”—
referring to a photo of Ree-o-meo.” ’Twas down South.

CORRESPONDENCE
“Constant Reader” (St. Kilda, Vie.): The
person who employed the dummy can be made to forfeit
the land and also be imprisoned. The correct course
would be to apply to the local Land Board for an enquirj
and this could best be brought about by the dummy sign-
ing a transfer to some third party, who would thus acquire
a locus standi to come in and challenge the right of the
squatter to hold the land. The dummy could then secure
the forfeiture of the land by proving that he was a
dummy and the squatter knew it and employed him as
such. The dummy might thereafter be tried for his
share of the dummyism, and it would not make any
difference whether he was paid for dummying 01
not, he would be liable all the same, although it
might get him a lighter sentence. If the squatter has
paid up the money due on the selection and obtained a
Crown grant for the land, the matter is, strange to say.
even simpler, because the Supreme Court would proceed
by way of Scire Facias to revoke and cancel the grant.
There have been millions of acres of the best land in N.S.
Wales obtained by these dummying practices, and every
single grant issued to the persons who did the dummying

something particularly clever, his envious friend,

What are the demands of the labour-unions
compared with the losses inflicted by the steam-
ship owners one upon another through the medium
of free competition? Judging by the absurdly
low fares recently and, from th.e recent
balance-sheet of the Tasmanian Steamship Naviga-
tion Co., the resolute and masterful firm of
Huddart, Barker & Co. have set themselves to
work to destroy absolutely the former firm. _ Mr.
Commissioner Eddy, who is a firm believer in the
principle of the state-ownership of railways, says
that as in England the loss of profits owing to
competition between private railways is over 20
per cent., he hopes to see the railways of Austra-
lasia consolidated, and run by the confederation
on an absolutely non-competitive basis as an
object-lesson to the world. If the State can run
all the Australian railways, it can also run all the
coasting steamships, and, by abolishing competi-
tion, save an enormous amount of wasted capital.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ The permanent military forces are held in readiness to
quell any disturbances which should assume undue pio-
i ortions. - Sydney Daily Telegraph.”
They have marshalled for the fight
I n their pride of monied might
And that willing serf of Capital, a cringing, char-
tered Press;
And remorselessly they’ve weighed
As their surest, strongest aid
That conception sheerly brutal, stark Starvation's
sternest stress.
What have we against their might?
We have Justice, we have Right,
We have love of home and children, we have trad
of man in man;
We have memories of the woe
W ' rough t in days of long ago
Ere arid since the toilers banded and the battle
first began.
We have Freedom to defend
To the sheer and bitter end,
For the right to band in unison all toilers great
and small ;
For tlie workers, too, we strive
In the whole vast human hive,
For the war is universal and in our defeat they
fall.
What is all tire wealth they own
But our concrete blood and bone,
Made by virtue of monopoly, a store of idlers’
food.
Thus the cancer spreads and thrives,
And its strength and force derives
From the self-same source from which the workers
also are renewed.
Law and Order! Hear them cry
As if they were doomed to die,
Though we simply curb their inroads, though we
scarcely touch the sore,
Though we let the cancer rest
On a tortured nation’s breast!
bet them save their breath to cry with when we
cut it to the core.
Law and Order ! In our hands
Are the twain. What power stands
In Australia that could punish, if we brushed the
la v aside?
If we choose to tear to shreds
Every law that on ua treads,
Can they bring to bear one engine they have not
already tried ?
Law and Order ! At their source
We could centre all our force ;
We could make the laws we bow to. We shall do
so iu the end.
Ear too long the few have reigned ;
When our triumphs are attained
Will they keep our law and order, as to their laws
now we bend ?
To the battle toilers come,
Though we gain no single crumb
We will cut the loaf in earnest in the future by
our vote.
Though this struggle come to nought,
Sterner battles must be fought—
There’s a good time coming when we’ll grasp the
system by the throat.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Silent in the silent Heaven
Gleams the lonely star of even,
.Floating lamplike in the pallor where the day-
gleam stricken dead
Falls into the ocean boundless,
Of the darkness, waveless, boundless,
Dies, and stains the dim horizon with his heart-
blood, sullen red.
Silent through the ocean silent
Drifts one fleecy-white cloud island
Trailing 1 vaporous o’er the embers of the half-
extinguished West;
Drifts o’er twilight peak and column
To the rayless depths and solemn
Of the darkness that is slumber, of the darkness
that is rest.
All is still. The granite ranges
Sigh no more beneath the changes
Of the wind that died with daylight but one little
hour agone,
As they stand their silence keeping
With the mists of darkness creeping
O’er their shaggy locks of forest and their frozen
brows of stone.
And they stand their fronts uplifting
Mid the dimness that is drifting
Per the blurred fantastic outlines of their thunder-
blasted rocks,
Where the sky and earth-line blending
Sweep around in curve unending,
Broken by the ragged masses of the sombre clumps
of box.
Night advances ; ’neath the trailing
Of her robes the faint gleams failing
Leave the wild, deserted gully to its weird aiid
haunted sleep,
While a deepening blackness swallows
All the rocky cliffs and hollows
Vs the stealthy-footed shadows up the slanting
hillside creep.
Silently the star of even
Gleams from out the darkling heaven
O’er the wild Australian forest, o’er the forms
grotesque and rude
Of the eucalypti an giant,
Rarik on rank, grim and defiant,
Stretching forth gaunt arms Briarean in the
awesome solitude.
All is rest. One last ray lingers,
Just to pass its lucent fingers
O’er the sinuous rocky crannies, where the water
drips along
To the pool that slumbers lonely
Round its granite boulders, only
Shadowed by the rugged denseness of one spreading
kurrajong.
It has fled ; the vision failing
Cannot pierce the silent veiling, ’
Palling, dew-like, from the heaven over r ck and
tree and hill,
As Night’s shadowy tresses streaming,
Lulls them to a deeper dreaming,
While she presses oh their eyelids, as a kiss, her—
“ Peace, be still!”
Even so : for we are weary
Of the long, long hours and dreary,
Of the naked desolation, of the loneliness accurst,
Of the never-sated yearnings,
Of the slow fire’s quenchless burnings.
Of the longing that is hunger, of the longing that
is thirst.
There is none to hear us crying,
And the day seems long in dying,
And the crown of thorns is bitter, bound around
our brows unblest;
But our sun shall have his setting,
And our sorrows their forgetting,
And our sins their absolution, when the night-tide
brings us rest.

The venerable Rev. Watsford is the doyen
of Melbourne Wesleyan parsons. He was “ given
up” last year, but is round again, hearty, amazingly
braced up with the Tongan news. He went as a
deputation to Tonga a few years back, being
an old chum of King George; but George Rex
gave him the cold shoulder, egged on by that
rascal Shirley. Mr. Watsford thumps a stick
down now, and expatiateth.
Characteristic sentences from the election
speech of Mr. W. L. Williams, a candidate for
die Borough Council of Sebastopol (Vic.)“ He
had done his best for the welfare of the borough
mid had improved it all he could. The Councillors
also had done their best. They had put a good
fence round the police-station, arid now they
wanted a good lock-up.” Mr. Williams has been
returned at the head of the poll. The electors of
Sebastopol evidently know the value of a man who
looks after their requirements.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
’Mid the mazy meshings of the tangled skein
Of men’s lying legends I have sought m vain
For a path to guide me, o , ■
For a hole to hide me
From the mocking mem’ries of remorse and pain.
Through the Delphic pages of unwritten lore
Wearily I’ve wandered, seeking (as of yore
Through uncounted ages
So have sought earth’s sag s)
Truth; the life eternal, or the “ nevermore.”
Can’st thou rend my fetters, break life’s gall mg
chain.
Free my tortured spirit, give it rest again,
Quell the mad desires,
Quench the living fires
W hose eonsumeless vengeance sears both he. rt an 1
brain ?
While I yet may linger on the misty brink
Of the Lethean river, ere I stoop to drink ;
But one hope I cherish
That the past may perish ;
That for me waits this eternal—dare I think !
Hail! thou tireless reaper, bearing what you may,
Darkness of oblivion is brighter than my day.
With my passing breath,
Bid you welcome “ Death.”
Strike you must; oh, quickly, therefore, strike I
pray !

M‘Lellan,the dissatisfied “dove of Ararat,”
in disputing the claim of a certain Frenchman to
be the discoverer of Bendigo goldfield, told the
Victorian Assembly that he (the Dove) took the
first parcel of gold—-251b. weight—from Bendigo
to Castlemaine. “If ever the hon. member was
entrusted with 251 b. weight of gold,” remarked
the irrepressible G. D. Carter, “it certainly is a
great historical fact.”
Archbishop Carr told
the students of St.
Patrick’s College, Mel-
bourne, last week that
“ in this country blessed
by nature, and by nature’s
God, every boy who is
innocent and educated
has a glorious prospect
opening in his career.”
No doubt. All such boys
may look forward to be-
coming Directors of
Building Societies. But
it is not necessary that
they should be “ edu-
cated.” Innocence is
enough.
While the Germans
besieged Paris, Theirs
came out of the city to
consult with Bismarck
about the proposed capitu-
lation. Of course it was
the Frenchman’s duty to
present a cheerful front,
and to seek to convey the
impression that things
were not m so desperate
a condition in Paris as
the besiegers might sup-
pose. On the other hand,
Bismarck was pretty
well satisfied that the
besieged Parisians were
being starved out, yet,
pf course, lie intimated
po such thing in the pres-
ence of M. Thiers. But
after the. conference Bis-
jnarck invited Thiers to
and the French-
man only too gaily ac-
cepted the invitation.
Then it was that the wily
German noticed th at
Thiers ate voraciously of
the vegetables and breads,
rejected the canned and
pickled foods, and par-
took with seeming avidity
of the fresh meat. This
confirmed Bismarck’s suspicions Paris was
starving.
George Ashton, a retired Government
officer, who resided at Williamstown (Vic.), and
who died the other day, was a man of sense. He

No advertisement; no attendants ; no mourning-
coaches ; no hatbands, scarves, gloves, &c. ! plain

The Escaped Nun, when last heard of,
was in England, pounding-out the yarn she has
told so often to .so many different audiences, and
scooping the money at the door with all her
ancient vim. The old, celestial fire still ,shines in
her eye, and the pile of this poor, trodden-on
martyr now amounts to a trifle over £30,000.
There are not many things in this world that pay
so well as to be a large, heavy, coarse, hoarse female
who fled from a convent under suspicious circum-
stances. If the escaped individual had devoted
her life to art or literature or plain needlework,
the chances are that she might have toiled for 450
years without getting together one-third of her
present humble competence, but being a person
with a soul that rose above details, and a
stehtoinan top-note, and a man-eating eye, and a
somewhat smudgy narrative, and a comprehensive
estimate of human stupidity, she has come out on
top. The toil-worn female who never escaped out
of anywhere, and who consequently ha * to labour
for 15s a week, will have to study these things,
and try to acquire that gorilla-like expression
which leads to affluence.
Another Great Win!
Mrs. Fanny Dent, wife of a gentleman employeu
in ihe Lambton Collieries, kindly allows us to
publish the following facts of her interesting case
and wonderful recovery, which we gather from
her correspondence, and which we shall be glad to
allow anyone to peruse who wishes to do so.
Mrs. Dent had been in a state of extreme
debility for twelve years, frequently quite un-
able to do any work, the lightest kind causing
great fatigue, with severe pains in the limbs, back
and left side. So severe was the pain that she
would have to sit or lie down frequently. Walk-
ing exercise was very trying and she could only
walk very slowly, She had long seen Clements
Tonic advertised, but like many more people her
husband was prejudiced against “ patent medi-
cines,” but (now w r e use her own wools) “I knew
some one who had tried Clements Tonic, and I
decided to get a bottle on the quiet and say
nothing about it if it did me no good. The effect
I thought something wonderful. I felt better
after the first dose, and by the time I had taken
half a bottle T was a different woman. My
husband, friends and neighbours soon noticed the
change in me, and they could not make it out. 1
had to tell the truth that it was Clements Tonic
that was'making me strong, 1 could not keep the
secret, I was only to glad too give the credit to
Clements Tonic. After finishing the bottle,
work was no trouble to me, but rather a pleasure,
and after doing a heavy day’s washing I could go
for a walk instead of hating to go to bed, as
always happened before taking Clements Tonic.
One of my neighbours said to me last week, ‘ Why,
Mrs. Dent, you are doing wonders this week, how
is it you are so strong, now ? She knew I had done
more that week than I had been able to do in 12
YEARS before (she had known me this time for I
am an old resident of this locality, having lived
here for 15 years.) I replied, ‘Yes, I feel a
wonder to myself, so I’ll tell yon the secret, 1
have been taking Clements Tonic, and I cannot
tell you the benefit I have derived from it. You
know what my sufferings have been and now t
have a genuine taste of good health.’ ”
Mrs. Dent wrote us those particulars of her
remarkable cure in March. She wisely, however,
decided to continue the medicine to “clinch the
cure ”as it were. Some time afterwards she wrote
as follows :
Waratah Commonage, N.S.W
Dear Sir, —It is with great pleasure that I pen
these few lines. I have been as you know a great
sufferer from weakness and debility for years. 1
was under several doctors, but they never did any
good. I DESPAIRED OF EVER BEING
BETTER, but as I stated in my last letter I saw
Clements Tonic advertised. I tried a bottle and
its effect was something wonderful. I felt better
almost immediately, and was a new woman after
finishing the first bottle. Before taking Clements
Tonic it was a great trouble even to do a little
house-work, but afterwards my work was a pleasure
and my friends and neighbours were surprised at
the change in me. I cannot say too much in
praise of it, and can only gratefully describe ray
case and strongly advise all who suffer from weak-
ness, backache, pain in the side, ringing noises in
the ears and shortness of breath to take Clements
Tonic. I feel sure it. will do them as much good
as it has done me.
Yours Gratefully,
FANNY DENT.

A hundred and fifty Grenadiers belonging
to the reserves—comparatively old and fat nurse-
maid-mashers and military flunkeys—have been
ordered to Bermuda “ to infuse a spirit of loyalty
into the younger soldiers.’’ They have gone as
missionaries—in fact, teaching humility and the
national anthem to the rising generation.
Stanley was so seriously ill that on the
morning of the wedding, prior to entering the
Abbey, he went into the deanery and rested on
the sofa for nearly half an hour before the cere-
mony. After the service, the bride and bride-
groom, in passing up the Abbey, crossed over tin-
grave of Livingstone. They took away with
them on their honeymoon “ an experienced nurse.”
Stanley is a howling Tory ; his wife is a howling
Radical.
The French realist, Guy de Maupassant,
was Flaubert’s favourite pupil, and for seven years
studied writing at the feet of his master. Each
week Flaubert would give his young disciple a
subject for an essay or a piece of descriptive
writing, and when the work was done it was sub-
mitted to Flaubert. The great novelist would
then criticise and tear the style to pieces, and
frequently, for his pupil’s guidance, rewrite the
whole thing.
While sowing his wild oats, the Marquis
of Hartington one night played three games of
draughts for £1000 a game, and lost all three.
He then cut a pack of cards for £500 a cut, and in
the course of a very few minutes dropped £5000
more. He never lost for an instant his usual non-
chalant air of sleepy indifference. He never can
get over an occasion when he yawned once during
his own speech in Parliament.

Oglethorpe, a wealthy man, who died not

Parnell usually wears a loosely-fitting cut-

In the Commons, recently, Bradlaugh
moved that the landlord’s privilege to obtain
twelve months’ rent before any other creditor is
paid, be reduced to six months. This was op-
posed by Hicks-Beach and that sham democrat,
“Joe” Chamberlain, who not so long ago proposed
to abolish the landlord’s privilege altogether.
A. G. Taylor writes that the present
N.S.W. Ministry must go, “ not necessarily to be
succeeded by the fanatic worshippers of a cross-
grained, inanimate Protectionist idol, but to pave
the way for the ultimate creation of an advanced
Australian party, rationally reformative in their
endeavour to lay the axe to the root of the shams
and swindles of this generation of political vipers.”
Signs of disaffection towards Duncan
Gillies and his gang are evident even in commercial
circles of Melbourne. At the champagne christen-
ing of Craig and Williamson’s new warehouse, last
week, a shining mercantile light flashed scorn upon
the present Ministry, and solemnly announced
that he only proposed their health as a matter of
courtesy. Which was equivalent to an earnest
wish that Gillies and Co. would retire into the
cold shades of opposition and die as soon as posrble.
The names of two rival candidates (M‘Lean
and Maloney) for a very small N.S.W. post-office
billet were the other day placed before Minister
O’Connor, who promptly said, “ Ap’int Maloney."
Henceforth, whenever Dan O’Connor appears in
public he will be greeted with the gag, “Ap’int
Maloney, ” which in its way is quite as good as the
Yankee currency, “And down went M‘Ginty,”
What a lovely election joke—“ Mr. Chairman, I
wish to ask Mr. O’Connor a question: Who
ap’inted Maloney ?”
Jack Woods, M.L.A,, declares that Hin-
doos and Mohammedans are better than Christians.
Quo’ Jack : “ They have a religion, such as it is,
that they really believe in and act up to. They
are not hypocrites, as we are. They will die for
their religion.” Jim Munro : “Won’t Christians
die for their religion?” Jack Woods ; “I never
saw a Christian yet.” Neither did we, Jack,
except once; and he was expelled from several
churches and from society because he held that
Christ was a Socialist, and he was in gaol every
other while on trumped-up charges of vagrancy
and lunacy, because he regularly (when he had
any) gave all his goods to the poor.
Dear Bulletin, —Do you call the follow-

Dock Labourers’ Union is now firmly established,
and its lists full. It has been decided not to
admit any further members at present.” This
seems to me like shutting-out men and forcing
them to remain non-union, and then execrating
and persecuting them as blacklegs for being non-
union. The position is not unknown among the
trades-unions of Australia.—Yours, Car Hen.

A not uninfluential citizen of Sydney was
recently shocked and grieved by the notice of his
brother’s death, in Melbourne. The brethren had,
at their last meeting, parted on terms of anger,
but now a great wave of fraternal feeling broke
over the sore heart of the survivor, and he in-
structed a certain firm to make enquiries as to
whether his departed relative was married, and if
the possible widow stood in need of assistance. In
due course came the news that the late Mr.
had been married 21 years, and that happily his
widow and four children were very well provided
fox-. For nearly a quarter of a century these two
sons of the same mother had built up their respec-
tive fortunes in adjoining colonies, neither of
them troubling to make one enquiry concerning
the other until the family hatchet was buried in
a Melbourne grave. Moral —Blood is thicker than
water, but not much.

For clear and unadulterated economy,
Governor Kintore takes the cake, also the whisky.
When the Cockburn Government were no-con-
fidenced Cockburn himself went home to bathe
his fevered head. A reporter was put on his trail,
but Cockburn refused to be drawn with regard to
his communication to the Governoi’. The scribe,
a quiet, gentlemanly fellow, from the Land o’
Cakes, hastened down to Government House and
asked to see His Excellency at 7 p.m, The
gubernatorial flunkey replied that his lordship
was dressing for a concert, and would see the
reporter a few hours later !—at 10 p.m. The
indefatigable scribe kicked his heels in
Government House once more, and was mes-
saged from His Excellency to the effect
that he was at a supper-party, and would
telephone for him when he x'eturned. At mid-
night the reporter, being telephoned for, went
down to Government House, to be ushered into
the Kintorian crib where H.E. stiffly handed him
the document he had been after, and sat smoking
a cigar with a bottle of whisky and one glass
beside him. Kintore calmly and frugally brewed
himself a glass of toddy, and although he had kept a
“ gentleman of the press” humbxxgging about from
7 p.m. till midnight, never even asked if, in Aus-
tralian phrase, “he had a mouth on him.” Pro-
bably if he had known that that scribe was a rigid
teetotaller, he might have risked it.

Lady Kintore was costumed as “ A Scotch

When the flood-dams were in course of
construction at Bourke, Dr. Hawkins offered his
services as honorary physician to the men em-
ployed. He was called up one night, or rather
morning, to see a man, and after a quarter-mile
walk found his patient sitting up in bed with
a pipe in his jaws. “Well, my man,” said the
doctor, “you don’t look very bad.” “No, Doc.,”
was the reply; “ I’m just going to take a dose of
Cockle’s pills, and I want to know how many it’is
safe to swallow,” The doctor’s reply has not been
recorded in Heaven.

Spagnoletti : “Well, well, is Reverend

Px’ops, of the Royal, died in the Alfred
Hospital. He was nigh gone when a friend
dropped in, the day there was a race between a
man and a horse. Props could hardly speak, but
made energetic contortions of his face. “Fetch a
clergyman?” said the friend;, “all right.”
“ N-no ! ” says Props, and twisted out ; “ W-whiclx

A French lady started in Melbourne as
“Artiste in Confections,” and Tallowfoot went to

Gorgius Midas Heliogabulus banquet of peacocks’

meant millinery, corsets, and all them things,
whereupon his coarse mind found suitable vent.

Lady Kintore pleaded “lack of accommo-

reason for inviting only 300 guests to her recent
“At Home.” This defect has only been noticed
by the Kintores, for where on earth used previous
occupants of Government House —Lady Fergus-
son, for instance—to stow their guests, some-
times to _ the extent of nearly a thousand!
The fact is that there are in Adelaide certain
people to whom Lady Kintore has taken an
intense dislike, and to invite them means to invite
their friends. This was one reason why Adelaide
people had such a dull season, and now that “at

People in a certain Sydney suburb are just
now very shy of accepting invitations to birthday-
parties. Invitations went round recently for a
spree of that description, and, after acceptances
had been sent in, a “friend of the family ” waited
upon the prospective guests and stated that it had
been decided to make the hostess a little present,
limited to 15s. for gentlemen, and 7s. Gd. for ladies.
During the evening the hostess was fairly over-
come upon the unexpected presentation to her of a
handsome silver tea-service.

Mr. John M‘Master, a hard-headed old
Scotchman, is Mayor of Brisbane. He was elected
to that position through a want of unanimity on
the part of the other aldermen—in a word, he filled
a gap caused by jealousy. He is a merchant in
the Valley, sells potatoes, tea, and chaff in a shop
with a not very pretentious front elevation.
Chang, the Chinese giant, could hardly stretch
hims-lf in it without the risk of lifting the shingles
off the roof. Mac elected to hold the customary
mayoral ball on a Friday night, and thereby gra-
tuitously offended a considerable section of the
community, principally the Jews, whose Sabbath
commences on that evening. Now, one of the
principal wards of the city is represented by a
Jew, who, taking in “the situation,” so to speak,
courteously remonstrated with his Worship before
any fixtures were made. But Mac’s foot, having
been put down, was immovable. Strained rela-
tions now exist between Mayor M‘Master and the
local Hebrews.

The fond father who promises “ young
hopeful ” a sovereign if he brings home a prize at
Christmas, is generally “had.” The papers for a
certain Australian Grammar-school annual ex-
amination are printed by the father of one of the
pupils. Consequently, when a particular pupil
had the golden nope of the usual sovereign held
out to him the other day, he cheerily replied,
“ All right, dad ; that’ll be ten bob for me and
ten bob for young Brownjones.” Brownjones,
senior, is the printer, and his innocent offspring
sells the examination questions beforehand at half
profits. O ! for the happy, guileless days of child-
hood.

by charging her husband with conniving at a
criminal assault which could never, say the neigh-
hours and police, have been committed upon her.
If married women can spin these yarns for the

little excuse must be made for the hysterical

of their having no husband to get into trouble.

to be prosecuted, while some time ago a number

The Primrose League women have pre-

Queer occurrence is reported from Arma-
dale (Vic.) A young man was in charge of a bull,
which seemed much attached to him, but he
struck it angrily with a whip and it gored him

Victorian pet pig which, when a child was lost in
the bush, made for it a nest of leaves, as the birds
did for Little Red Riding Hood. Which romantic
stories take one back to the tale of the N.S.W.

dead body and beside it a faithful dog, which
growlingly resented his approach, had to shoot
the dog in order that its master might be buried.
On a loud outcry arising as to the inhumanity of
this, the trooper explained that the reason he shot
the dog was that it was eating the corpse. We

The wealthy men, or well-born,
Needn’t be a bit afraid
If they happen to have travelled
On the influential nod—
It is nasty to be snavelled,
But they never go to quod.
True, their teeth begin to chatter,
And their noble brow is hot,
Till they find it doesn’t matter
Whether bigwigs pay or not.

Using someone else’s brief,

In the station-master’s grief.
His conscience it distresses
To demand, in gentle tones,

The culprits greet ins pleadings
For forgiveness with a wink,
And the end of the proceedings
Is an influential drink.
But when a son of labour
Has the dashed plebeian cheek
To emulate his neighbour,
He is brought before the beak;
The director and the shepherd
Have a license still to rob,
While the working-man is peppered
To the tune of forty bob.

Her lip was red, her eye was black,
Her hair was long and flaxen,
The whiteness of her naked back
Was absolutely waxen;
There never lived a girl more chaste
In style or conversation,
Her bodice low exposed the waist
To wordly admiration.
She slew the dudes with haughty glance,
Although one languid scoffer
Avowed he trembled, lest perchance
Her arm-bands might slip off her.
No passion heaved her ample bust,
As pure as snow and colder—
She had not any fleshly lust
Except for showing shoulder.

In Bismarck’s youth he fell violently in
love with one Fraulein Johanna von Puttkammer,
whose behind-hand appellation reminds ns strongly
of a Caledonian gathering. Her parents, with,
whom he was acquainted only by letter, stood him
off a while, but at length invited him to visit them,,
no doubt with a view to sampling the young man.
When he rode up to the house all the Puttkammer
clan and many of their "neighbours had assembled
to inspect him outside the house, but the man of
blood-and-iron gave them no time for deliberation,
for though Fraulein von Bultkammer’s parents
nut on an air of grave solemnity, and the young
lady stood with eyes modestly , bent upon the
ground, Bismarck, on alighting, threw his arms
around his sweetheart’s neck and embraced her
vigorously before anybody had time to tell him
that this conduct was hardly the thing. The result
was, however, an immediate betrothal.

An Australian lady writer asserts that now
that the cut of corsets, by giving women the
appearance of slender-waistedness, has obviated
any necessity for tight-lacing, the fashionable
lady’s struggle is for small hips rather than slim
vVaists. Long contemplation of the undraped,
female human form divine on the glowing can-
vasses of numerous picture-galleries, prompts us
to assert that any such struggle must inevitably
result in disastrous failure. The feminine waist
alone was made for compression.

In the Nimes Court in France, a recen
divorce-case came up, in which the wife claimed
as hers certain articles of jewellery presented to
her before their marriage. Prominent among
these was the engagement-ring. The judges de-
cided that not only is a woman entitled, before the
law, to all those articles of value which a lover has
seen fit to present to her before marriage, but that
the “ ring offered for the purpose of recalling the
engagement of two persons, constitutes the mo t
personal and most irrevocable of all souvenirs
given in view of marriage.”

At the presentation to Dr. Neild, Dr. Le
Fevre aptly remarked that had Neild concentrated
his attention on medical practice he would have
made a large fortune, for everyone knows what
jealous mistresses Physic and the Law are in re-
gard to a man doing outside work. With all his
pains and enormous loss of time over theatrical
criticisms, semi-scientific articles, and so on,
Neild would only get about as much for them
in a week as he could have realised by a few first-
class medical visits, occupying perhaps a couple of
hours, or even less. A professional man simply
slaughters himself by going out of the groove.
The public think that a man cannot handle an
operating-knife or make a diagnosis if lie so far
unbends as to play cricket (in public); and there is
not an old woman in the land who does not firmly
believe that if a doctor visited her attired in a
Panama hat and a white flannel suit, instead of in
a chimney-pot and black frock-coat, she would die
within 48 hours. The doctor has both literally
and metaphorically to “dress his part,” as they
say on the stage, just like the parson. The only
profession in which dress up to now has counted
for nothing is the Press, whose ablest and most
original members have, in our tolerably wide ex-
perience, been utterly indifferent to the voice of
the convenances.

| take no notice of the fact that the usual designa-
tions bestowed on Chinamen in your semi-serious
paragraphs are “leper,” “heathen,” “Chow,”
etc., because, firstly, you write good and sensible
leaders, and, secondly, the abuse any journal may
hurl at the Chinese will affect their future just
about as much as the barking of a dog at the moon
influences a tidal wave. If I have read the article
m question aright, you assume the position to be
this—That the Chinese are bound to mix with the
other races of the earth: will the fusion be the
result of a Chinese conquest or a conquest of the
Chinese, or will it be effected gradually and peace-
fu]]y? My opinion is that the inevitable fusion
w ill be effected partly by a Chinese conquest, and
in a greater degree peacefully and quietly,
# *
The Chinese have been, and are still, at the
bottom, an essentially warlike and conquering
people. The ideas entertained by Europeans 30
or 40 years ago that Chinese were useless as
soldiers have now been dissipated. Read any of
the books bearing on and treating of the Taeping
Rebellion, or the late Franoo-Chinese war, and
you will cease to doubt that Chinese soldiers arc
of stern stuff Gordon thought them and
IT ALL WEIGHS.
OWNER OF HORSE (which has passed thepost first, to jockey) ; “SAY, LAD, STOP
THAT SPITTING THE MUD OUT OF YOUR MOUTH—YOU’LL
WANT SOMETHING TO MAKE UP FOR LOSING YOUR CAP.”
found them to be of first-class quality. And does-
not the fear—ever growing among European
nations that the Chinese will yet enter on a
career of conquest spring from an instinctive
recognition of their infinite military possi-
bilities ? How is it that Europeans never
discuss the probability of the teeming mil-
lions of India conquering the world ? The
answer is that they know the majority of the
natives of India are “ not built that way.” Never-
theless, I do not think that unless goaded by
national insults, or unless, to use M. Hue’s words,
a “Tchengis or a Timour once more appears,”
the Chinese will ever enter on a career of world-
wide conquest. Outlying and adjacent Asiatic
races and countries they will probably rather in-
evitably assimilate, conquer, and annex. The
Malay Archipelago will almost certainly be theirs,
nominally and virtually. Put, further, in a mili-
tary sense, I do not think they will go.
* # *
It is true of the Chinese “ That the
common sense of most holds a fretful realm in
awe.” The Chinese are, in their own way, a well-
educated people, and read extensively. All their
writings and philosophies decry and denounce war
as unnatural and undesirable, as well as mostly
unnecessary. These arguments are specially
applied to wars undertaken for purposes of con-
quest or to acquire military glory. These reason-
ings, operating for centuries, must have, and have
bad.’ considerable influence over an educated
people like the Chinese. Therefore, all Chinese
Governments for centuries past have adopted, in
theory at least and very often in practice, the view
of the national philosopher, who declared that
“ the glory of the most splendid victory is but the
light from a conflagration. ”
* * *
Now, why do I consider that the ultimate
fusion of races will be effected on the whole
peacefully? Because the Chinaman is so (if 1 may
here apply the word) omnivorous in the matter of
women. Place him where you will among the
Indian women of British Columbia, in the
Mauritius, in Africa, in the Sandwich Islands, in
Malaysia—in fact amongst women of any racc, he,
to use a colloquialism, “ tackles them all. _ Of the
readiness of Caucasian women to assimilate or
rather to permanently mate with the Chinaman
hundreds of young fellows like myself are living
and undoubted testimony. All Orientals are
lovers of women, and the Chinaman lias the
additional advantage in that he has no pre-
judices whatsoever. And to the Chinamans
credit, and to that o: his Government, let
this be said : He values his progeny,
no matter from what race or manner of
woman begotten; and to his children, especially
his heirs male, the Chinese Empire opens its arms,
claiming them as her children, and ready and
anxious, if they have any ability whatever, to
enlist them in her service.
» # #
It is no use denying that Caucasian women
arc ready to mix with Chinamen. Although in
the Australias the Chinamen are not of the
higher and more leisured classes of their race, and
suffer under a kind of social ban, European women
I perhaps from the curiosity natural to the sex) in
abundance mix and mate with Chinese. It is the
old form of the forbidden fruit. Depend upon it,
the man who wrote Genesis (this witli all respect)
knew female nature. I have occasionally heard
Chinese who have served in high-class houses and
families unfold tales funnier than their own.
Nature has blessed yours truly with a counten-
ance which might belong to Sitting Bull, a
Spaniard, an Arab or an Italian ice-cream vendor,
and fit any _of , them naturally. In my travels
ladies often enquire of me as to my somewhat
hard.-to-fix-bn nationality. My outspoken reply
that I am a Chinaman never seems to bar me from
their good graces —nay, it seems to act otherwise.
Therefore I say that women of all races being
ready to smile on Chinamen, and that Chinamen
being equally ready to look with favour on all
races of women, together with the number of
Chinese and their peculiarity of being able to live
in any clime, leads me to believe that the ultimate
fusion of races, so far' as the Chinese are con-
cerned, will be more peaceful than, perhaps, may
at first sight be expected. So much for the China-
men.

Shout hooroo for great St. Peter,
Whom the nations love and bless !
Turn your gas on at the meter,
Skiters of the sporting Press !
Let the banners proudly flutter.
Brazen bands create a din —
Bend the knee and rub the butter,
Into Peter’s dusky skin !
Round Ins limbs like lambkins frisk (),
While his toadies glibly tell
How “at home,” and then in ’Frisco,
Peter gave the beggars h ,
Acted like a real good ’un,
Never meeting one defeat;
Heathens have their idols wooden,
Young Australia worships Pete.
Dressed in Piccadilly clobber
He’s a sight for gods and men ;
Fall upon his neck and slobber,
Work him up a rousing “ ben. !”
Never mother had a black son
Greater since Othello died—
Modest in his worth is Jackson —
See, he doesn’t put on “ side !”
Maybe braver men and bigger
Stand aside and shun the light,
But they couldn’t touch theniggei
If they met him in a fight.
Peter’s lively as the kittens,
Fresh as flowrets in the Spring,
When arrayed in boxing-mittens
He cavorts around the ring.
Shout hooroo ! and tell the story.
Story of the bruiser’s fame ;
Wiser people, seeking glory,
Live and die without a name :
Men of learning, arts, and labour,

Brother, learn to punch your neighbour

In the IN ew Hebrides 50 years ago there
was not a Christian. The missionaries tackled it,
white men settled in it; now there is neither a
heathen nor a Christian, but a mixed lot of
sectarians.
Varley’s mission amongst the good young
men of Adelaide was not a brilliant success. The
Adelaide papers refused to report his utterances ;
and a large proportion of the local unco guid are
just now in gaol for swindling.
“ Apples from Victoria, New South Wales"
is a headline which appears in large capitals in the
Field. Apparently geographical information is
somewhat scarce in London, which, we gather from
the map, is the principal town of a small island off
the coast of Quid Oireland.
When Maclvor, the 14-flag fire-eater, was
in Australia, he used to rage like a vain heathen
if his name was spelt either Mclvor or MTvor.
He told us once that the full prefix “ Mac,” with
a capital letter after it, indicated the head of the
clan, and that, as he was the head of his clan, his
name was to be spelt “Maclvor.” Now, the
President of the Victorian Legislative Council
spells his name (or the papers spell it for him)
“Macßain.” Can “Scotty the Wrinkler” tell
ns since when has Sir Jimmy been head of the
clan Bain ?
Tlio Victorian police have in hand a com-
plete list of the Ned Kelly family, in,all its rami-
fications, beginning with Red Kelly, Ned s
father, a desperate card, too, in his time, though
not a criminal. The Kelly tribe extends to 70, all
carefully labelled, but all behaving themselves
admirably. Collateral branches are headed by
Wild Wright, &c., and Steve Byrne’s mother, who
once diagnosed the presence of troopers in the
Clenrowan Ranges, merely by seeing-,the sun glint
on an empty sardine-tin, a long way off. This, to
the keen-eyed Mother Byrne, was like Robinson
Crusoe’s footprint on the sand.
Ex-Premier Morehead, of Queensland,
wantonly fooled his office away when he
threatened to increase the whisky-duty, and pile
up the impost on rum and gin. The man who
runs the Parliamentary refreshment-room an-
nounced that the price of drinks would have to go
up, and straightway B. I). Morehead's Govern-
ment melted away like an ice-cream in that re-
vised Sheol which used to be written plain Loll in
other days. If Morehead had beeijy, Moses him-
self with the Ten Commandmcntafmder his arm,
and the seven wise men thrown in, he would pro-
bably have burst just the same. It is safer to
talk back to a policeman, apd have two gastric
complaints, and gout in the Stomach a- well, than
to raise the price of drinks in any free and en-
lightened community.

The U.S. Shipping Subsidy Bills.
“ The two shipping subsidy Bills have passed the
Stmate, and will almost certainly become laws
within the next month. They are bound to have
a marvellous influence upon American shipping.
The Tonnage Bill provides a bounty of 30 cents a
ton for every thousand miles sailed for 10 years,
after which there is to be a reduction of three
cents for the following nine years. Under this
arrangement every American wheat ship leaving
San Francisco for Liverpool, and carrying, say,
2000 tons, will i - eceive from the Government a
gratuity of $5OOO on the round trip. It is
calculated that every sea-going vessel afloat under
the United States flag will receive from $5OOO to
$lO,OOO a year from this time on, and that the
total expenditure for the first year will amount
to $0,000,000, w Inch, of course, will be rapidly in-
creased as time rolls by. Senator Frye, who had
charge of the Bill, said that he had as nuance that
the adoption of the measure would be followed at
once by the organisation of ship-building com-
panies, and in the putting afloat of swift ships to
ply between the United States and every quarter
of the globe. That there will presently be such
activity in the ship building trade as the country
has never seen, may be taken to be an assured
fact. Then there is the steam lino subsidy Bill,
which provides that steamers of the first class, and
capable of being turned into cruisers in time of
war, arts to receive sfi per mile for every
mile steamed. Steamers of a lower class, such
as carry only freight, are to receiv • sub-
sides graduated from $3 to $1 per mile. Postal
mail steamers are all to be of the first class._ This,
of course, saves our Aiutralian line, which the
colonies have so long supported. The subsidies
granted to first-class mail-carriers is the most
generous ever provided by any country. It will
give the Pacific Mail Company’s steamers an im-
mense advantage over those of the Canadian
Pacific Company, and may have the effect of run-
ning them off the Japan and China route. It is
estimated that under this bll $G,O'OO,OOO a
year will at once be called for, with
thv prospect of enlargement as rapidly as
new steamers can bo built. It is plain
that a new era is upon us. The power of money,
■which in these times can aeeompl sh almost any-
thing, is to be liberally used to give us sailing
fleets and steam lines that can afford to plow the
ocean in quest of commerce, until they have found
enough of it to pay them without a subsidy. An
enormous commercial fleet will quickly dispose of
our over-production, and build up an ever expand-
ing trade that will levy contributions from all
nations. With our home market saved by protec-
tion, we shall by these liberal bounties win the
markets of the world."

DR. SCOTT’S Electric Hair Brushes will pos-
tively CURE Nervous Headache or Neu-
ralgia in live minutes, if used according to
directions. In ordinary everyday use they will
promptly arrest falling hair and baldness, dan-
druff, and diseases of the scalp, and make the hair
grow long and glossy. These beautiful brushes
are made with pure bristles—not wires, which
injure the scalp and cause baldness and irritation.

The Referee.
In face of the general abuse under which the
Australian Eleven at present labours, it is surprising to
find that the Australians have actually scored more runs
than the Britishers in the matches played. Up to July
20th the Australians had played 34 innings for a total of
5275 runs, as against their opponents’ 4725 for 35 innings.

The Melbourne Athletic Club are anxious to
make a match between Slavin and Jackson, and offer to
lay the Sydney club £1000 to £800, outside the purse, if
the pair meet"in Sydney. Should the men fight in Mel-
bourne, they want the odds the other way about.

A jockey recently disqualified for 12 months by
the Y.A.T.C. has sent along a strictly comical petition for
remission of sentence. According to his yarn he
“pulled” his mare without compunction, in obedience to
instructions, and was subsequently promised that the first
time she won he would get the whole of the stakes. She
did win in due course, but as the faithful jockey only re-
ceived a bonus of £10, which wasn’t enough to support
his aged mother for a long, weary year, he now desires to
resume active work in the interests of his needy relative.
Any other kind of robber might show as much cause and
reason for being permitted to continue on the job.

Hopetoun has hunted at last. He took a wild
dash with the Melbourne hounds from Kew into the wild
woods of Nunawading, which yielded that amazing
character, Fisher the Messiah, who is said to be flourishing
on the more ’ooman principle, though well up in the tooth
by this time. Nine ladies attended the meet. Hopetoun
was in at the death of the fox, but most of the ladies were,
too, so that one argues the run must have been frightfully
severe. Miss Watson got the brush, and Mr. Payne rode a
horse named Pleasure.
The difference between staying power on the
flat and “ across country ” was instanced at Caulfield the
other Saturday. Audacity, a horse notorious for dying
away to nothing at the end of a six-furlong flutter, can-
tered home in a two-mile hurdle race. Circumstances
change the non-stayer into what sporting writers call “a
glutton for distance.” As a matter of fact, any crock can
“stay for ever” if the pace be slow enough to suit it.
“ It’s not the miles we travel, but the pace that kills.”

It is wired that one Dalton has outrivalled
Webb’s historic Channel swim, but the egg having been
broken, what is the use ? We have always thought this
feat of Webb’s the most remarkable of any kind in the

all the scientific experts said it was blankly impossible.
Such paradoxes are not unfamiliar in other spheres.

Pile’s gallant old grey, Mahdi, one of the gamest
and most popular of steeplechasers, broke his leg at
Adelaide On Saturday week. The owner, who loved the
nag as though it were his own son, was much cut-up when
the horse was shot, and has had him stuffed. Mahdi
showed-up the Victorian steeplechasers last winter.

Gov. Kintore, who thinks of embarking in

The horse Orient, who won the Wellington
(N.Z.) Steeplechase lately, is 17 years of age, and has run
second and third for years back in steeplechases, and they
do go over the country in Maoriland. Orient’s big weights
kept him back, but this year he got in light on account of
old age, and made them go all the way. Bland Holt’s ex-
stage-horse, Sir Maurice, was second to Orient !

On dit that Titan is a vastly-improved animal,
and that good as his style of going was when last in
Sydney, his moving now' is the equine poetry of motion.
His entries at A. J.C. Spring Meeting are confined to the
“ classic ” events, and after all is over, his plunging owner
perhaps won’t be much out of pocket over the 4000-guinea
purchase-money. Carbine is in great “ fix,” and bids fair
to sweep the Spring weighfc-for-age races, as he did the
Autumn. At a glance, Melos appears to be the only horse
likely to prove a thorn in his side, but, then, Mr. Gannon’s
horse appears to be weighted with ill-luck.

Medina, winner of Sydney Tatt’s. two-year-old

Against Notts, the Australians scored 148 and
115, while their opponents put 145 and 138 together, and
so our men once more went under, to the hardest nut
they’ve had to crack in any year among the county teams
—this time by 20 runs. They defeated Gloucester by
eight wickets, 'scoring 184 and 25 for two wickets, while
the county team made 77 and 130. The total score now
is—Lost, 13 matches ; won, 10; drawn, 8.

hasn’t left his record on the other side of the herring-

Captain Tom Merry, the American Commis-

Next to Nordenfeldt he liked Lochiel. Lochiel has been
purchased by Mr. James Thompson, of Rylstone, for stud
duty, and his new owner will not be displeased when he
hears such an opinion of his horse from so good a judge
of horseflesh.

At Tattersall’s meeting at Randwick on Satur-

first and second for the Spring Handicap. The only entire
to show-up prominently was Pugilist, who won the Selling

Hitherto the rule has been “the better the
speaker the worse the fighter,” but Peter Jackson last
week showed that it is possible to raise a man who can talk
as well as box. In replying to the splendid reception given
him at Sydney Athletic Club, Jackson spoke for upwards
of half-an-hour with fluent delivery and well-chosen words,
and as Jackson, previous to his travels, was usually tongue-
tied when compelled to speak before an audience, his
modest, manly and really eloquent address struck his
hearers as hard as one Of his right-handers. Bendigo,
alias Thompson, left the ring for the pulpit, and should
Peter take to the business Pastor Jefleris’ occupation is

A solemn-looking man walked into the office of

the summer.” The item read:—“ Amateur Sailor : The
quickest way to bale out a boat while sailing is to pull out
the plug in the bottom.” “ I’m afraid we can’t do it,”
said the clerk, regretfully, upon which the solemn party
folded up the paper and walked out with a deep sioh.

THE PRESS OF LONDON
WHAT IS ITS VERDICT?
While the Press of London is careful not to en-
dorse any advertised remedy or patent invention,
we have all along observed that articles of actual
merit of new invention from which the public are
likely to be benefited are readily taken up and
endorsed; while, on the other hand, advertised
specialities, which do not bear actual value on the
very face, are as eagerly taken up and exposed as
was the case recently when one of the leading
society papers exposed many of the much adver-
tised quack medicines, greatly to the injury
unprincipled proprietors, but of incalculable bene,
fit to the public. When the Press of London com-
bines to throw the full light of investigation on
any subject, the result that invariably follows is,
the good comes to the top, the bad goes straight
to the bottom. As an illustration of what the
London Press thinks of one of the leading adver.
tised articles, we quote from the following : —
Whitehall Review : “ St, Jacobs oil has, it
appears, received no less than six gold medals dur-
ing the past year, for its wonderful efficacy to
‘ Conquer Pain.’ ”
Modern Truth : “We recommend this truly
wonderful remedy—St. Jacobs oil—to everyone
who is suffering from pain. We are personally
acquainted with many marvellous cures effected
by its use. ”
St. Stephen’s Review ; “It is said that a great
number of London postmen would be wholly un-
able to perform their duties were it not for that
famous remedy, St. Jacobs oil, which they apply
to the muscles after a severe day’s work.”
The Salon ; “The remarkable cures effected
by the use of St. Jacobs oil have become the sub-
ject of extensive comment on the part of leading
newspapers.”
Sunday Times (London): “ Prom our personal
experience and inquiries, St. Jacobs oil will ac-
complish all that its proprietors claim for it; its
extraordinary merits are being rapidly recognised,
as shown by the daily increasing demand.”
Weekly Dispatch : “St. Jacobs oil has cured
thousands of cases of rheumatism and neuralgia,
which have resisted treatment for the greater part
of a lifetime.”
Were space to permit of it, the foregoing might
be supplemented to an almost unlimited extent by
extracts from dozens of other leading London
newspapers, but enough has been said to show
that it is not at all to be wondered at that St.
Jacobs oil has a larger sale than any other medi-‘
cine in the world, and, while the proprietors ex-
pend a fortune every year in their advertisements,
it is only actual value in the remedy itself that
will bring out such unqualified and voluntary
endo"sements from so large a number of high-class
papers, some of which are among the most conser-
vative in England, and it is only actual merit in
the remedy itself which will allow the sale of St.
Jacobs oil in England alone to average over 18,000
bottles per week with the demand steadily increas-
ing, while the sale of other remedies advertised for
similar purposes gradually grows less.
BRITONS IN NY ASS ALAND
SOUTH-EAST AFRICA.
Livingstonia, Lake Nyassa, East Central Africa,
Karonga,
26th Feb., 1889.
Gentlemen, —At the urgent request of a friend
in Africa, I have been persuaded to write you
regarding one of the Waterbury Watches, which
I wear every day, and can recommend for time-
keeping ability. It has been in Africa for three
years, travelled from London to Zanzibar, from
Zanzibar to Lake Tanganyika, from Lake Tan-
ganyika to Lake Nyassa. It has been twice
underwater in African rivers, had at least two
falls, and been severely handled by many natives,
many of whom look upon it as something marvel-
ous. Once it was taken down when the spring
leaped from the case, giving us all a fright, and
lay some yards off, a giant thing of many feet in
length. In the fights we have had at Nyassa with
the Arabs, it has been with me in several engage-
ments. Notwithstanding all it keeps good time,
and it is not rivalled by valuable watches. For
wear and tear and time-keeping in a rough country
like Africa, I think there is nothing better.
Believe me, gentlemen, most respectfully yours,
David Kewe Cross, M.8.C.M.,
Ordained Missionary, Livingstonia.
The Waterbury Watch Co.
D.K.C.
F.S.—The watch is one of your humblest.

BWOEM CERTIFICATE.— Owe of Thousands more/
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888,
To H. F. KuoelmanX, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to, certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago w ith a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of v\edieine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse everyday, w&Ming'aivhy whtil
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, a,nd the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed, j
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I j
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only paper which has a con*
Bistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
THE Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Cods and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese,
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting mors
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
lave unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form—printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress: it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege—the direct cause of
half the misery which now afllicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any pther paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
ntelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact —easily ascertainable from any postal
official —that, of all journals issued in^Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
ind best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
irtistic, and its policy the boldest and most
itraightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Dear Bulletin, — In a recent issue you
write of the funds of the various Australian
labour unions not being able to stand a long drain,
and also that the capitalists could easily put by a
fund of £lOO,OOO. That is a large sum of money,
but it is not equal to one half the amount that is
at the command of the Sydney, Balmain or Red-
fern branches of the Amalgamated Engineers.
The amount of money at the disposal of any one
of these branches is £209,779 135., this being the
amount in reserve funds at the end of 1889. By this
date this sum has increased to about £230,000. The
fundamental principle of this society is that should
any dispute arise between any members and their
employers, the whole of the funds is at the disposal
of the branch affected. Thus at Sunderland the
engineers spent nearly £40,000; and should the
occasion require it, they are quite prepared to
spend a larger amount in Sydney, Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, or any other part of the world
where its members may have trouble. This society
represents the true federation of labour, having
branches all over the globe, which latter fact ap-
pears to be an objection in the eyes of a very few
in Sydney, as they seem to prefer a purely local
affair. You must not confound the Amalgamated
Engineers with the Marine Engineers’ Association,
or the Australasian Engineers. It takes these
latter societies all their time to support their offi-
cers in affluence, so that they cannot afford to
help others.—Yours, &c.,
AN ENGINEER.
Premier Cockburn was fairly “had” dur-
ing the last few minutes of the recent no-con-
fidence debate. There had been an election for
Yatala the day before, and the Doctor, near the
end of his speech, said that the electors had sup-
ported the policy of the ministry, arid that they
had returned a member who was a ministerial
supporter, and would vote for them. After the
usual moral, the Doctor sat down triumphantly.
Up jumps Butler, the new member. “ After the
speech of the Premier, I have decided to vote
against the Ministry! ” Doctor Cockburn said
nothing, but the look of agony on his face was
most expressive.

846 Macquarie-stree't North, Sydney, August 27,1890.
Mt Dear Moorabinda, —
The ordinary, novel-reading female enters a local
painter’s atelier with her eye in the corner to see the
bold, bad model dodge behind the crimson curtain. And
she is invariably disappointed. In the Sydney studio
there is the correct air of Bohemianisra and general
scrimmage; brushes, paints, properties muddled all over
the room, but the model—never, no matter when she
calls. Somebody asked me once if the Sydney artists
have lady-models, and I counter-questioned what they
wanted ’em for? In the studio of Percy Spence and
bister Lister, for instance, there are several finished pic-
tures for the N.S.W. Art Society’s show on the 6th—
eleven from the camel’s-hair of Mr. Lister and five from
that of Spence, not one of which calls for the bended arm
and bare shoulders of the lady-sitter. Lister’s are all
landscape—the chief being a large “View on the Lane
Cove River,” valued at a hundred guineas—a deliciously
sweet, cool, convincing picture, without a trace of a
woman in it. Percy Spence’s.great effort is the “Com-
rade’s Grave ” (for the figure in which H. B. Jewett was at
first sketched in) —a horse, a man, and a rude, unkempt
heap of stones in the yellow light of sunset.
The St. John’s Eve cantata given by Sydney University
Musical Society in the great hall on 18th inst. drew the
usual erudite throng which patronises its own talent to
a praiseworthy extent. The performance, owing to in-
adequate rehearsal, wasn’t soothing, but the conductor’s
strategic pause—ostensibly to wither where they stood a
few harmless individuals stealing to catch a tram—saved
the final chorus from a distressing break-down. All the
principal vocalists had horrid colds, and the gown-
ing—except Mrs. Winblad’s white silk and jet, and Miss
Naylor’s pink silk and Maltese lace—made me sorry Eve
ever awoke to the necessity of petticoats.
It’s a terrible truth that you haven’t to scratch Sydney
culture very deep to strike the intellectual Tartar. After
all the gush over “ Doll’s House,” and all the shrill battle-
cries of the Ibsenites, only a nutshell audience ranged
into the School of Arts, on 22nd inst., to hear the gifted
Charrington discourse on the Norwegian ladies’ man with
the aid of a music-stand, a drawing-room set and a tall
black hat. “Brandt,” “Peter Gynt,” and “Pillars of
Society ” were the dramas enthused over to a bored crowd
who punctuated pathos with winter-coughs and kept one
eye on the door where a small boy kept oscillating with a
loud clicking sound, just for the fun of the thing. And
when Mr. C. said he was afraid to touch on “Ghosts” (a
drama treating boldly the delicate question of heredity)
lots of women with bonbonnibres on their knees,
thought he alluded to the supernatural, not social
bogeys, and tittered encouragingly at the “ funny ideas.”
Most of the time was taken up with “Brandt”—a re-
ligious crank run by a demented female who turns up
with straw in her hair at every crisis, and makes nasty
remarks which annoy the hero and cause him to feel em-
barrassed, but there are some very powerful and pathetic
points about Mr. Brandt to which the lecturer did full
justice. Peter Gynt and “Pillars” were only touched
upon, and the worry finished up with a few self-apologies
from Miss Achurch’s husband after which the audience—
including Miss Walenn and Captain Helbert, Judge and
Mrs. Windeyer, Consul Griffin, Mrs. Manning and Mrs.
Charrington bore down the dark passages to the light of
day and the sound of the dinner-gong.
After all, Sydney culture finds it more imposing to air
its superior convictions, per “ letter to the paper,” at a
penny a line, than to dissipate three shillings to sit in an
atmosphere it really doesn’t appreciate, where the chances
of a large, admiring audience are remote. A free lecture
on the “ Improbability of the Improbable,” or any other
unnecessary analysis of nothing, would be crowded to the
steps, but to ask culchaw to lay out money on or about it*
sham pet fad is a mistake all enthusiasts commit until
they “know the ropes.” High-class reasonings behind
the floats, with every suggestive line and situation left in,
draw the cult like nurse-girls to a wedding, because they
like their pill gilded with music, dresses, thuds and
squeals. But Ibsen, mounted with a roll of MS. and a
tumbler of water—well, it isn’t the same thing, my dear.
Marriage is a more or less disastrous undertaking, and
the temper of the old and tired Benedict is apt to get
badly out of gear, even over a fly in the soup, because he
has a heavy load to bear, and boots generally go up when
the twins learn to walk But though rage on the part of
the father of seventeen children is to be looked for, still
you hardly expect a man fresh from his honeymoon to
feel bitterness against mankind, combined with a wild
desire to wage war on his species, do you ? Yet only the
other day one of the masters at a Sydney State Schoo l
returned from his brief connubial Elysium to his scholastic
rule, and the first thing he did was to “ wallop” every boy
in his class! That is the way most people feel after
honeymoon, I expect, though everybody hasn’t th"
materials so handy to vent their feelings on.
Sydney Owl Club held their first annual ball at
West’s, on 21st inst., when over 200 people put in a festive
appearance right at the top of the programme, which
concluded at 2,30 a.m. There were several prettily*
coloured dresses. Mrs. Tollemache (wife of the President)
■vore heliotrope merv and purple velvet with Medici collar
edged with pearls, skirt relieved with mauve chrysan-
themums ; Mrs. Sheridan maize satin, maize crepe mingled
Artistically with pale-grey and pink brocade ; Mrs. John-
Btone, ciel-blue silk and crSpe and diamonds. The supper
was served cafe fashion.
Have you ever remarked that when the fashionable
woman has pink cheeks her baby invariably has pink
cheeks, too ? “ Just my colour, bless the ’ittle sing,” and
the story of the female who dyed her infant’s hair to suit
her own doctored locks is repeated every day, with varia-
tions. Everybody thinks “Baby has mamma’s bright
colour, so mamma's colour is natural, after all.” Chil-
dren—especially the hapless man-traps of sassiety widows
-—do, indeed, deserve the prayers of the congregation.
The Southern Amateur Theatrical Society put grease-
paint on its speaking visage at the Royal Standard on 21st
inst. and went out for to try a fall with the “legitimate” this
time—Watts-Phillips’ “Lady Camilla’s Husband” being
wrestled with in a frantic way for a cast of several. There
was a large, well-garbed house, including Miss Watts-
Phillips (come to see how pa’s little effort bore up under
the affliction, I suppose) in an egg-coloured frock,
chaperoned by Mrs. Rignold in black and cardinal; but
neither Mayor nor Mrs. Burdekin were present—possibly
because they attended the last one. The wail was excel-
lently staged, the village-set being well done, while the
idea of the anvil sounding faintly from “ behind ” was an
inspiration ; and it only the Lady Camilla hadn’t been
reminiscent of a metamorphosed marionette, and if the
husband had tightened-up his belt another hole, things
would have been simply blissful, since the gipsy of Victor
Cohen was a distinct conception, and the dancing of Miss
Andrews evoked a furious encore and a “bokay.”
Not having a guiding “field state” to tell what colour of
hat the Tinpot Creek warriors had on, your Sappho only
simply grasped the great main fact that Moore Park, at
the cadet review on 23rd inst., was covered with a large
number of boys, attired variously and marching extremely
well, who didn’t seem to have so much colonel to the
square inch as is the custom in maturer regiments, and
whose juvenile officers didn’t fall down with the neatnes 8
and celerity of the full-grown major when his charger
kicks a fly off. Lady Carington presented the colours—
red, white, and blue, and, I think, blue and gold—on
horseback, wearing a hunting-habit of black cloth, glossy
beaver and white gloves, and sat her clipped brown
mare to perfection when the geegee objected to
having the colours thrust into its (ace. Lord
Carington wore the picturesque russet uniform and
cock’s feathers of the Colonel Commanding N.S.W.
Cavalry; brother Rupert masqueraded as a Hussar,
and Captain Helbert was rather reminiscent of
street-music in a tight uniform and a weird, burnished
helmet. Sir Robert and Master Hamilton and Captain
Trench drove to the scene of carnage, and Minister for
Education Carruthers was the observed of all on top of a
big bay steed. In the ticket-enclosure there was a
weird commingling of “ society” public-school teacher and
Member of Parliament (headed by Sir Henry Parkes, seen
for the first time in public since his accident) relieved by
one or two professionals—Alfred Plumpton gesticulating
in a tall hat, and tenor Woodfleld standing with his
mouth open to miss the jar of cannonading, according to
the latest scientific principles. The Misses Manning were
there in black gowns and hats, and two well-known Sydney
belles scuttled about like crabs in strange dark-blue
frocks cut d Id Noah’s Ark.
It’s sincerely to be hoped that no “representative’
person felt ill in Sydney on 20th inst., since it was de-
cidedly Esculapius’s day out, and all the doctors (headed
by Sir Alfred Roberts), in glossy top-hats and wondrous
linen, were actively engaged in cheering languidly while
Lord and Lady Carington opened the Carington Convales-
cent Hospital at Camden—Mr. W. H. Paling’s magnificent
gift to the poor. The day encouraged picnic sensations,
and the drive from the station to the hospital under rows
of flags reminiscent of washing was a delightful two-miles’
spin. The ceremony in inaugurating the “gift”—a
handsome two-storey brick structure in dark-grey trimmed
when I gazed on it with red flags, and sitting on top of a
hill overlooking stretches of beautifully-grassed land—led
to the usual remarks, listened toby a flock of Camdenians
in riding-habits, mostly, and corduroys, who opened eyes,
ears, and mouth as Lord Carington, in a blue tie,
chatted inaudibly on the door-step; after which Lady
Carington opened the main entrance with a gilded
key (golden keys open most front doors when you come
to think of it) and everybody rushed wildly inside.
The internal arrangements are the picture of spotless
cleanliness, and there are three nurses and a matron to
keep them so. Rather unkind “ gifts ” to the hospital are
two spikey palms on either side of the vestibule. They
nearly took out my speaking eye lots of times, and if they
remain as placed the chances of a convalescent coming in
with a wooden leg and going out with a dog and a raised-
print Bible are six to one. The Masonic Cottage Hospital,
opened shortly after the Centennial, by Lord Carrington,
is a comfortable villa with a mirror in the hall hat-rack,
which did a brisk trade while the crush lasted, being the
first glass visible all day. The invariable tree-planting and
a sandwich-lunch crowned the proceedings.
The day being fine, fine clothes resulted. Lady Caring-
ton looked charming in heliotrope poplin and velvet with
gold galon, bonnet en suite, the bouquet presented by the
committee being a fragrant arrangement of English prim-
roses, violets, tuberoses, white hyacinth and ferns—
though, with her usual gentle kindliness, Lady Carington
carried a broomstickish posey presented by the Camden
children instead of the more artistic tribute. Mrs. Burde-
kin’s tasteful gown was in mignonette-green cashmere
with panel and Zouave of a design in green velvet arum
lily leaves, toque in green and tomato-red velvet and lily
leaves, black lace parasol. Mrs. W. H. Paling, a hand-
some black velvet and braided mantle, bonnet in green
velvet and pansies; the Misses Lake (her daughters)
sported very fetching black picture hats, and Sir Robert
Hamilton (Governor of Tasmania) wore grey tweed and a
smile, while a naval gentleman moved the spectator to
sympathetic tears in a salmon-pink tie, tan boots and a
silver chain bangle.
“ Paul Jones ” dies in his boots at Sydney Royal, so to
speak. The last but fifth performance, on 23rd inst., saw
a full house, pioneered by Lord and Lady Carington and
Sir Robert and Lady Hamilton. Lady Carington—who
has just recovered from a twinge of rheumatiz—wore a
bodice and train of white armure over a jupe of fine white
lace, the bodice made with Medici collar and lace sleeves,
diamond ornaments, the managerial bouquet in white and
violets; Lady Hamilton, a medium height, straight-
featured woman with really golden hair, wearing a blue-
grey silk trained gown with draped front, opera-cloak of
white braided with gold and edged with swansdown—a
managerial bouquet similar to Lady Carington’s aiding
the toilette. Sir Robert (I wonder if he misses his fishing
excursions to the salmon-ponds yet? On one of these
occasions the whole party came back because they had
forgotten, not the bait, but the corkscrew) wore a tasteful
silver star on his coat the size of a cheeseplate, and Lord
Carington contented himself with parting his locks in the
middle. To put the vice-regal guests at their ease,
Snazelle addressed Aggie Kelton as his “ little Hobart
Trumpeter ” in the first act, at which the house was rent
in twain, of course. By-the-by, the strategic non-com-
mittal nature of the new encore verse in “ Two Mariners
Bold’’should induce the thoughtful study ei all people
addicted to taking sides in a crisis.
A square-headed person writes to a Sydney daily,
landing the 24in. waist of the indigenous school “ missle,”
and sighing over the fact that "in a few years Mother
Grundy will declare they are ‘quite too stout,’ and forth-
with their ‘figures’ will be taken in hand by misguided
(ought he not to say Grundy-guided ?) aunts and mothers
. . . until the natural, well-developed waist is cramped
and crushed until it looks like a wasp’s.” Most of which
is quite true. The only thing is, though, that the
budding school-girl doesn’t yearn after a Straight dia-
phragm if she can help it. Frequentlythe “misguided ”
female relative, who dispatches her darling in an unbusked
condition, is deceitfully circumvented by the darling pro-
ducing a leather belt of minimum inches when she gets
round the corner, and holding her breath while an obliging
chum hauls in. The girl who takes a thick waist through
a boarding-school, and brings it out unreduced at the
other end, has the hardihood to hang on to it through
life, no matter whether an army of aunts badgered her
with stay-boxes. And, conversely, the young lady with
hygienic parents but waspish predilections will reveal a
top-shaped outline, even though the only central support
her mamma accords her is a “ Sanitary” combination and
a tape. But, after all, every small waist you see isn’t
tautened up to indigestion point. There is a true story
of a Sydney woman who had to tie “ a thickness ” round
her diaphragm to give the lie to the rumour that she was
disconnected in the middle—and even 17in. centres are
sometimes a natural inheritance. But they are a gift to
the few—an achievement for the many.
If I were a thief, the times I should choose to prowl
round with the bottle-cart and fruit-barrow of duplicity
would be vice-regal “at home ” days. More than hafi
Sydney, I’m sure, pounced down upon Lady Carington on
21st inst. to revenge themselves for the two wet preceding
receptions, and the crush and hubbub in the “red draw-
ing-room ” made even strong men turn pale and make
tracks for the breeze verandah. As was to be expected
on such a Springiab day there were one or two “ forced ”
garments on view, but they were oruel makeshifts. Lady
Carington’s gown was in shot-fawn-and-pbik silk and fawn-
brown velvet, bonnet in gold lace, coronet of blush roses
and fawn-brown strings ; Lady Hamilton effectively wore
drab cashmere draped over a jupe of white amure, revers
of the armure with collar, cuffs, side revers and edgings
of beaver fur, bonnet in drab velvet and pointy white
wings, white parasol. Miss Walenn dark-blue and feathered
hat. Mrs. Fairfax Ross a nobby tailor-built frock in grey
diagonal braided black with black velvet sleeves, small grey
velvet Alsatian bonnet with grey wings and black jet,
grey gloves and furled en-tout-cas— a very workmanlike
rig-out. Miss Burdett Smith bronze silk with flowered
silk side-panels, bonnet en suite. Mrs. Severn (a daughter
of Sir Alfred Stephen) black silk and pansy toque. A
brown cashmere and silk with brown guipure was topped
by a patriotic little hat of wattle-blossoms. Mrs. Char
rington (Miss Achurch) who came with her husband, wore
a chow mantle and a big black hat and veil, and was in
furious demand. Lady Maklay lightened her mourning
by violets and passementerie, and two stout ladies had
crowned themselves with yellow roses. Miss Myee Oar-
ington was hauled about the grounds in the pink of con-
dition and a white sun-bonnet, Master Hamilton was sulky
in loose boot-laces, and the Hon. Rupert Carington with
a straw in his mouth suggested sherry-cobblers, or a
training-track.

It is an interesting: example of the vigour
of British enterprise that it has spread even so far
as Siberia. Many of the mines in that frozen land
are leased now by British capitalists, and the
Kussian exile, who grinds away his life in un-
speakable wretchedness down in the bowels of the
earth because he was suspected pf wanting a Par-
liament, or a system of local self-government, or
something of the sort, is labouring lo bring in divi-
dends for Christian speculators in London. Also his
wife and his daughter, who were sent along with
him because they were supposed to h»v« evil
thoughts about the Czar, are toiling as b«»ets of
burden for thp benefit of a British shindykit with
an affable smile and a big corporation and a soul
filled with benevolence towards all mankind.
British capital is a ubiquitous thing.
Verse We Have Read.
The Card-Dealer.
Could you not drink her gaze like wine ?
Yet though its splendour swoon
Into the silence languidly
As a tune into a tune,
Those eyes unravel the coiled night
And know the stars at noon.
The gold that’s heaped beside her hand,
In truth rich prize it were ;
And rich the dreams that wreathe her brows
With magic stillness there;
And he were rich who should unwind
That woven golden hair.
Around her where she sits, the dance
Now breathes its eager heat;
And not more lightly or more true
Fall there the dancers’ feet
Than fall her cards on the bright board
As ’twere a heart that beat.
Her fingers let them softly through,
Smooth polished silent things;
And each one as it falls reflects
In swift light-shadowings,
Blood-red and purple, green and blue,
The great eyes of her rings.
Whom plays she with ? With thee who lov’st
Those gems upon her hand;
With me, who search her secret brows ;
With all men, bless’d or bann’d.
We play together, she and we,
Within a vain strange land,
A land without any order, —
Day even as night, (one saith,) —
Where who lieth down ariseth not
Nor the sleeper awakeneth ;
A land of darkness as darkness itself
And of the shadow of death.
What be her cards, you ask ? Even these ;
The heart, that doth but crave
More, having fed; the diamond,
Skilled to make base seem brave ;
The club, for smiting in the dark;
The spade, to dig a grave.
And do you ask what game she plays ?
With me ’tis lost or won ;
With thee it is playing still; with him
It is not well begun;
But ’tis a game she plays with all
Beneath the sway o’ the sun.
Thou seest the card that falls,—she knows
The card that followeth;
Her game in thy tongue is called Life,
As ebbs thy daily breath :
When she shall speak, thou’lt learn her tongue
And know she calls it Death.
DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.
Ten Years Ago.
Dost thou remember the old garden, where
We used to steal,
To build our silly castles in the air,
My pale Lucille ?
I was thy Knight; and thou, my love and Queen,
No shame didst know-
For had we not played—babies on the green—
Ten years ago ?
We part. We meet. Thou statelier grown, and
cold,
X gaunt and grey,
For thou art rich, and I—in sorrows old
Since childhood’s day.
“ Lucille !at last, my love!” Your pale cheek
flames.
“ Did you not know
My husband, sir; we met when was it,
J ames ? ”
“ Ten years ago !”
Well—mine the fault was if I did not please.
You judged the best.
You feared for poverty, and longed for ease,
Comfort, and rest.
His horses stepped as high, your diamonds made
As brave a show,
For all he won them in the tallow trade
Ten years ago.
Yet that white brow, methinks, is less serene
Than in that time,
When bright birds sang and trees and fields were
green
In youth’s fair prime;
When all the world smiled rosy at our feet
In fancy’s glow—
Ah, me! what wondrous dreams we dreamt, my
sweet,
Ten years ago!
Now you are sadly learned, I am told
Five tongues you speak,
You sing, compose—what leaf is that you fold ?
Plato in Greek!
I see —you study at all times—you fret
At progress slow;
You had not needed Greek, dear, had we met
Ten years ago!
Nay, never blush, Lucille. lam not base
To him or you.
From thy soul’s cell no love must his displace
Thy whole life through.
His safeguard and thy solace Ties in this—
Is it not so ?
His constant kindness since the bridal kiss
Ten years ago.
We meet. We part. If life’s bright best be lost,
Much still remains;
Perhaps a higher heaven for him, the cost
Paid with thy pains.
Good-bye, my dear, and if this tale you tell,
These verses show;
Say only, “ This man fought a hard fight well
Ten years ago.”
And ever fights! For if, as churchmen say,
In skies above
Soul mates with soul, as ray melts into ray,
And Heaven is Love,
He will be there, and—if he still loves thee —
Must never know
That thou on earth hadst e’er a thought for me,
Ten years ago.

The Sydney Clerical Divorce.
The sorely-afflicted better-half of the Rev.
Andrew Gardiner, of Sydney, has got a rule nisi
for a divorce against her more or less wicked
husband, who is understood to be now lecturing on
morality and things to the good young men of the
holy city of San Francisco. After reading in
the daily press the evidence in the affair.
Which, summed up, appears only to amount
to a tolerably strong 1 case of suspicion, We are
somewhat at a loss to know the exact grounds. Ob
which the lady has succeeded in getting rid of her
burden. If the law, as laid doWn by the learned
Judge in favour of Mrs. Gardiner, is to stand a&
the law of the land, it may be as well, considering
the already mixed condition of the Australasian
matrimonial laws, to glance at the condition of the
tI.S. marriage laws, as laid down by a reputable
Californian paper:—
Marriage and divorce are regulated in America
by State laws, and in consequence there are as
Many different laws as there are States. These
different State laws vary according to the moral
Strictness or laxity of the people. A civil ceremony
is valid in all the States, except Maryland ; tlifj
Court of Appeals has decided that in that State it
is necessary td have “a religiods service of some
kind in Order to constitute a Valid marriage;”
.Kentucky declares, bjv its Statute, tMt “Marriage
is prohibited arid declared void when hot solem-
nized Or contracted in the presence of ail
authorised person Or society.” Those in Mary-
land, however, who do not desire a religious
ceremony, may go in an hour to Washington City,
where another and different Marriage laW exists.
Those in Kentucky who may object to any cere-
mony can cross the Ohio River and find in Ohio,
Indiana Or Illinois a Marriage law lax enough to
satisfy the most liberal-minded free-lover. In
North Carolina the later decisions are so
ambiguous that the question as to what
really constitutes marriage is left in doubt.
Tennessee requires a ceremony for whites, but not
for negro marriages. The United States District
Court held that a ceremony was necessary to mar-
riage in California and Oregon; but as this de-
cision lias been overruled in California, it may not
be good law in Oregon. In Delaware, Maine,
New Hampshire, and Vermont the question is
left in doubt. It is an open question, never
having been directly decided upon, in Arkansas,
Colorado, Connecticut, Dakota, Florida, Idaho,
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Vir-
ginia, and Washington. There is a large number
of States where it is well settled that no ceremony
at all is necessary. In other words, people may
marry themselves. They need no officiant or wit-
nesses. Over thirty millions of American citizens
live under taws where the mere interchange of
consent to become man and wife may constitute
legal marriage. Mr. Bishop, in his work on
■ * Marriage and Divorce” (vol. 1, p. 184), says :
The leading principle is, that consent makes
marriage. No form or ceremony, civil or religious,
no consummation or cohabitation, no writing, no
witnesses even, are essential.” In New York, and
other States adopting the same policy, mutual con-
sent is all that is necessary to constitute a binding
marriage contract. In California agirl of 13 declined
at first a proposal of marriage on account of her
youth, but accepted later No ceremony, civil or
religious, was performed; it was not shown that
Mey both exchanged consent. But they were
■egally married. In most States, a man and
woman who agree to and do live together as
tusband and wife, and introduce each other to
the world as such, are legally married. Thus we
find a confusing variety of marriage laws, as
among the different States. In some, a civil
ceremony is required; in others, both a civil and
religious ceremony is necessary ; and in still
others, a marriage may be valid with no ceremony
at all. That which would constitute a legal
marriage in one State would be either concubinage
or bigamy in another. If the home is the founda-
tion of the State, and marriage the foundation of
the home, then thete should be but one marriage
Idtv, uniform and just, throughout all the States
and Territories Of the Union. At present, a boy
df fourteen and a girl of twelve may run away
from school and legally marry without the consent
or knowledge of their parents. In fact, the line of
prohibition is only drawn clear and sharp at seven
years. This is an outrage upon common decency.
Such is the present conflict of laws, as applied to
divorces, that a man may be divorced in one State
and still married in another. In one State he may
marry agan, in another he becomes a criminal if
he does. We frequently hear in this day of
“ divorces which are not valid extra-territorially;”
“ A New York man married an Ohio girl; they
liVed together in .New York ; had trouble ; she re-
turned to her pareiits in Ohio, and after some
years brought suit, arid a decree of absolute
divorce was granted her, the only service being by
publication in a Ideal Ohio paper. When he
heard of this ho married a New York woman;
and was promptly artested, and found guilty
of bigamy.” So the divorce that was valid
in the State of Ohio, was worthless in New
York. In Ohio they were both single and able
to marry ; in New York they were still married to
each other. ■ His children in New York by another
woman would be illegitimate, and have no pro-
perty rights. The divorced wife in Ohio would
continue to have a wife’s interest and title in all
his property in New York. Thus by this conflict
of laws he is a husband without a wife and she a
wife without a husband. Among the various legal
causes for divorce are the following: “Insanity”
before marriage in most of the States, and insanity
after marriage is a legal ground for divorce in two
States. “ Imprisonment ” prevails as a cause in 15
States, and mere “ conviction of crime ” in over 30.
The term of the imprisonment varies from “life,”
as in Connecticut, down to “ one year,” as in New
Hampshire, and in other States it appears to bo
immaterial. In still other States it is only neces
sary to be guilty of “ gross misbehavior,”
as in Rhode Island. In Missouri, “ vagrancy ”
is sufficient ground, and her legal defini-
tion of a vagrant is : “Every person who may
be found loitering around houses of ill-fame,
gambling-houses, or places where liquors are sold
or drunk, without visible means of support, or
shall attend or operate any gambling device or
apparatus, or be engaged in practising any trick
or device to procure money or other thing of value,
or shall be engaged in any unlawful calling what-
ever.” Is it possible to conceive of a law more
open to abuse than this? “Unehastity” before
marriage, concealed from the other party, is suffi-
cient to render the union null and void in twelve
States. In three States —Kentucky, Massa-
chusetts, and New Hampshire—divorces have
been granted on the ground of certain changes in
religious opinions. Then there is the follow-
ing group of causes, which embrace all
the easy divorce States Cruelty,” “ vio-
lence to person,” “indignities,” “severity,”
“great bodily injury or great mental distress,”
“gross misbehaviour or wickedness,” “gross
neglect of duty,” “public defamation,” “endan-
gering the reason of the other,” “ habitual indui*
gence of violent and ungovernable _ temper,'’
“desertion” for, from “five years” in Rhode
Island, to “ one year” in California, and “habitual
drunkenness ” for, from “ three years ” in a num-
ber of States, to “one year” in Missouri and
California. Then, to cap the climax, in some
States the list of causes for divorce is ended by
“any other cause within the discretion of the
court.” This reduces marriage to the low level of
concubinage, at the pleasure of, the parties and the
option of the courts ! Reading all this, one can
easily understand that the divorce granted by
some Yankee authority to the alleged bigamist
M‘Leod is genuine enough.
To Travellers.

‘i All ire give to travellers is a pannikin of flour.”
Did you ever take “the wallaby” along some
dreary track
With that hideous malformation, called a swag,
upon your back ?
Did you ever seek a billet dn the squatters’ stamp-

Where wide bare plains are ’neath you and the
burning suit all round ?
Did you ever ask for rations in the dusky gloam-
ing hour,
And humbly from the squatter take “a pannikin
of flour ? ’
Then the meanness of both parties to this paltry
little play
Must have struck you : “What shall end it?” is
the question of to-day.
We all know about the manner in which station

Dear Bulletin,— All persons acquainted
with Esmarch’s popular or scientific works, must
have been greatly surprised when they read in last
week’s Bulletin that this great surgeon considers
water filtered through a cemetery harmless and a
cheap beef-tea. Your informant evidently en-
tirely misunderstood Esmarch’s sarcastioal way of
speaking. No surgeon can abhor the remotest
contact with dead bodies more than Esmarch does;
at all his graver operations spectators are only ad-
mitted on their solemn word of honour that they
have not touched a dead body or been present at a
post-mortem during the previous fortnight; and,
great as the interest is which he takes in the p.m.
examinations of the few patients who die under
his care, he can never lie persuaded to be per-
sonally present, but receives the report of his
special assistant for this purpose (the “ septic
assistant” as he is called) in the open and dis-
infecting sea-breeze of the Baltic shore. Much
against his will Esmarch once presented me with
a surgical instrument and a biting lesson. When
coming from anatomy class as a medical student
in Kiel, I met Esmarch, who, while passing me,
dropped a small instrument from a pouch ho
carried. I quickly picked it up for him, but to
my intense annoyance the great surgeon refused
to accept it again, and keeping carefully several
yards away from my infected presence, he begged
me in his most cutting style to remember, for my.
future life, that an instrument once touched by a
person just come out a dead-house was unclean
and unfit for surgical use for ever afterwards.—
Rejected.

Tales of “The System.”
No. VII.: The Commandant’s Picnic Party.
(FOR THE BUL LETIN.]
IiS .,A spot,of exquisite scenic beauty was—-aiy«d
Bcraggq, having deteyriliriea ppon entertaining - the
fadies of the garrison at a picnic, chose the Dell
as the picnicing grounds. ,
Lest, however, the selection of the Dell should
be conceived to be due to a natural appreciation
of the beautiful possessed by the G.C., it liaq
bettqlihe stated, tliaithe choice was hotiialiy iiidde
by,cbrivict KriatoUblill, , , : - t u . ~, .
f .That blue-blooded, rascal (afterwards hanged
for .murder, in Sydney) was ; .Commandant’#

Commandant, condescended to ask ,h is advice. ~ . -

the officers’ ladies an outing, with a tramway ride

. Knatchbull rose 1 fr'offi the desk where he' Was
checking the day’s ration-sheet, and, saluting,
thought for a moment before replying.
“Yes, sir,” he said at last, “there’s East Dell—
& most beautiful place, and easily gdt at;”
“East Dell —Where’S that?” queried the G;G;,

“That will do nicely,” said the C.G. “I’ll

Knatchbull—you ought to be used to that sort of
thing—an ‘ upper-ten’ man like you.” He laughed
gaily, and proceededq “ It’s time,you did a little

mandant would look for results, and would say to
him :
“ Well, Knatchbull, any new * plant ? ’ ”
•* So-and-so, sir,” the wretch would replj By
the “ plant ” was not meant a botanical specimen,
but a trap or plot to “ put away ” another prisoner.
Knatchbull spent his leave in laying such traps.
And, as a consequence, he generally got his posi-
tion improved—at the expense of some poor con-
vict who had less intelligence than trustfulness.

Commandant Sciaggc was a gallant in-
dividual, and as jealous as gallant. He delighted
in demonstrating to the few ladies of the garrison
thai His sojourn ,in this “demm’d spot,” as he
Wbuid call it, in his pleaSaht Way, had iiot Siiprii

When, therefore, lie heard that Dri Gropott had

Veiiiarh, 1 and, equally,, qf; cqmrsje, put his, tongue. ip

Governor Phillip dropped her anchor off Wind-
mill Point; and that, leaving her captain to make
his report and deliver his manifest of- live and

notion was a ball. There would be no difficulty
as to music; half-a-dozen instruments were owned
by members of the military and civil staffs, and
the “ convict-strength ” included a score or so of
brilliant players—but the room ? There was only
one building which would answer the purpose, and

The picnic morning was faultless. The

air conferred a tieHsuous happiness i add sbhg.apd,
jest burst spontaneously frohi lips that Were
generally occupied in muttering the idle common-
places of Establishment gossip.
The settlement party started from the Grass-
plot at ten o’clock. Four of the ladies went in the
lumbering and ricketty vehicle known as the
State-coach, and the others and the children, in
haihhlocks, Were carried palanquin-fashion by
convicts Whoin Knatchbull had previously drilled
fpr k day b 0 that they should keep step, and carry
their “ dainty burdens ’’—the phrase is hot ohrs,
but Mr. Knatchbull’s —with a gentle, swaying
motion. The gentlemen, of course, walked to the
quarry-ledge, whence the whole party would be
taken by the tramway up the steep Longridge
ascent to a place within a hundred yards of the
prancing-ground.
It was the most joyous of marches, and the gay-
est of pro'cessiohs. EVeh the bearers of the ham-
riib’cks Wore infected by the high spirits of the

of the “ cells,” yet* They kept step all the same,
because, for once, their pulses beat in harmony
with their’ work/ ;/ They ventilrbd sometimes ‘to
laugh a subdued chords to the louder merriment of
their masters and mistresses,
“Mr, Scragge,” exclaimed Mrs. Browning to
the Commandant, who was walking by the side of
her hammock, “ how the System is libelled, to be
sure 1 Yon know some of those drefldftll news*

months later, and thus enabled; th6i happy, (and,
artful) convict to receive from “ his pe’ple ” W

soup ” the proceeds of some melted, stolen plate.,
“ I am so pleased to have that man’s testimony
tb the beneficial working of the System,”-said the
p jar jy the C.C. “I shall write and tell dean
j ja dy Franklin about it at once and all my other
f r i el j(;ls.”
“I shall be really obliged if you would,”-re*
Seragge, the smirking smile of the vain
m a n who is complimented to his face resting on

dfered that it strengthens pur hands wonderfully,

Just as this highly-satisfactory conversa-
tioh Was concluded the party reached the Quarry,
Here they found another group waiting for them,

The waiting group included Superinten-
dent Darrell, Dr. Grocott, and Chaplains Taylor
and M‘lndoe. These names are placed in the
order of their official importance. Compared with
Superintendent, a doctor ,and a clergyman were,
in the estimation of the System, particularly siriall
potatoes indeed.
The Superintendent having bowed to the ladies,
called the .Commandant aside. ,
~ “ Taylor’s going to retake a litiie row, I think,
sir. He’s goirig to ask the ladies pot to go in the
truck if that,fellow Tappiri—the forger, you know
—is kept in the team.”
“D—-n his iiripucjerice !” blustered the C.C,
“If lie interferes with discipline, I’ll suspend
him.”
“I, think I would, sir, if I were you, That
Tappin’s becoming more desperate everC day!
Why, he assaulted the Chaplain himself last
flight ”
, “He did, did lie? Oh, and I suppose the
parson is coining the‘turning, o’, t’other cheek’
dodge—expects to irielt tile, obdurate heart by
hiagnariimioy arid sort of rot, does he?
sneered the Com ni arid ait t'. “I’ll show him the
System knows a little better how to deal with the
Tappin tribe than the Church does.”
; The two admirable administrators advanced to
join the others, and came up to them in time to
hear the Protestant Chaplain remark —
“You must know, Mrs. Browning, there is
what is called ‘ chummage.’ Everyone who comes,
bond or free, has to pay his or her ,‘ footing.’ He
or she must do something for his or her circle.”
The parson spoke with an affected jocularity, so
as to diminish the serious aspect of this attempt
to foil the authorities.
“Yes?” laughed Mrs. Browning. “ And must
I pay my ‘ chummage,’ as you call it?”
“We can make no exception,” responsively
smiled Mr. Taylor. Now, to pay your footing,
will you do me a favour?”
“ If I can—and will be thankful if you will let
me off so lightly.”
“Then, dear madam, pray ask the Commandant
to remove Convict Tappin from D Gang !” In a
few rapid sentences he sketched for the lady
Tappin’s first and present condition—how, though
a convict, he was, from education and training,
acutely sensible to his degraded surroundings,
and how the man’s spirit recoiled violently from
membership in the worst gang on the Island.
Mrs. Browning, troubled to the shallows of her
butterfly nature more by Mr. Taylor’s earnestness
of tone than by his narrative, looked round for
her husband, that he might advise her, but the
lieutenant had strolled to the edge of the quarry
and was looking down at the workers. Then she
looked at the Commandant. He took the glance
for a question, and was about to reply, when
Darrell, fearing that the Chaplain would obtain
his wish, interrupted. Darrell knew the Com-
mandant ; knew that a woman’s request would have
more weight with him than a volume of soundly-
reasoned representations from an official.
“Permit me a word on the Chaplain’s state-
ment, Mrs. Browning. Mr. Taylor speaks from
the standpoint of the Church, you know, and
looks to the individual. We have to regard the
System and the mass. Leniency to this man
would foment a revolt among all those in D Gang,
who have not committed criiries so awful as his.”
“ Less awful than his, Mr. Darrell!” ejaculated
the Chaplain, astonished. “You know this man
is a forger—nothing more !”
“You surely forget, Mr. Taylor, that Tappin
committed sacrilege. Did he not outrage the
sanctity of the Church in assaulting you, sir? We
must punish him for that, if for nothing else,”
said the Superintendent, with an overflowing sar-
casm in his voice.
The Chaplain winced at the jibe, but all he said
was that “ Tappin was not sent toD. Gang for the
offence of striking himself, which offence had not
been reported.”
“ Do you mean to say, Mr. Darrell,’’asked Mrs.
Browning, horrified, “ that this prisoner really
assaulted' Mr. Taylor ?”
“ Yes,” replied Darrell. “But Mr. Taylor is
so generous as to overlook it. But we, who are
responsible for discipline, can’t afford to go by
the Sermon on the Mount. We’ve got to obey the
Queen’s Regulations. And there’s a slight differ-
ence between the two !”
“Oif the man is so degraded as to strike a
clergyman,” exclaimed Mrs. Browning, who had
all her sex’s superficial reverence for “the cloth,”
“ I couldn’t think of interfering.”
“That’s right,” said the Commandmant. “I
shouldn’t have liked to refuse your first re-
quest, Mrs. Browning ; and yet it would have been
awkward to have granted this.”
“But, my dear madam, perhaps I didn’t make
myself clear,” impetuously cried the Chaplain. ,
‘ Perhaps you don’t understand that this man, as
one of D. Gang, will have to pull you up the hill
an these trucks to-day. The other men are accus-
tomed to the work; they are indeed beasts —I
won’t say whose fault it is that they are so ; they
can’t be degraded lower, but this man—surely you,
an English lady, will not consent to be drawn by
a man who, abased as he is, is, or has been, an
English gentleman ! ”
“An English gentleman ! Well, that is good !”
laughed the Commandant uproariously. “ Why,
Chaplain, you’re a perfect humourist! An Eng-
lish gentleman—ah ! ah !”
“ I’m sure all English gentlemen will feel
honoured at your—ah—comparison of them to a—
doubly-convicted forger,” said Dr. Grocott.
“Oh, Mr. Taylor,” said Mrs. Browning, “if
the System and Justice requires the man’s punish-
ment, and puts him into the team, I don’t see that
a lady can object.”
Cautiously Mr. Taylor then intimated that
neither he nor his wife could join the excursion.
Father MTndoe said that he sympathised with his
reverend brother’s position in the matter, and
would also, if the Commandant would allow him,
withdraw his acceptance of the latter’s kind invi-
tation.
“ You can do just as you please,” shortly said
the great man.
# # *
The constraint of this just-recorded inci-
dent soon evaporated and the picnieers took their
seats in the trucks, making the process one of
much merriment. Most of the ladies, the children,
and the Commandant and Doctor Grocott were in
the foremost waggon, and the rest of the party
gathered in the other.
When they were all seated, Overseer Crunch
came to the Commandant for instructions.
“Are we to go slow or quick, sir?” he asked,
touching his cap.
The Commandant turned to his guests. “-Well,
ladies, what do you say ? Shall we go slowly or
quickly? You command here to-day, you know,”
was his gallant remark.
The ladies tittered, but none spoke. Then—
“ Which is hardest on the poor men?” asked
Mrs. Browning’s child Nellie. Nellie had not for-
gotten Martin’s death.*
“Oh, don’t think of that at all,” rejoined
Scragge.
“ But which would be ?” the girl continued, with
a child’s persistence.
What the Commandant would have answered
it is impossible to say. Little Ada Budgeori
made a laughable interjection—at least so it
seemed to Messrs. Scragge and Crunch.
■ Turning to her playmate) Nellie, she exclaimed ;
“You silly thing! You called the prisoners
poor men ! Convicts airi’t men—ate they, ML
Scragge ?”,
. Unlike Nellie)_ tliis child had beeii born find bred
in the “Establishment;” She hail lived iri trie
atmosphere of a corivict-statiqri froth birth, and iri
the depths of her infantile experience she had dis-
covered the profound truth Underlying the System
that “ convicts airi’t men.”
Her remark became the Island hon mot.
. ..When his laughter subsided the Commandant
said to Crunch : “ We’re ready. By the way,
where have you put Tappin ?”
“His Washup, sir?” grinned the blackguard.
‘ I’ve made him unicorn, by Mr. Darrell’s orders,
sir. He’ll come better under the whip, so.”
“Very well,” said the Commandant.
* * #
“Ready, all!” shouted Overseer Crunch.
Overseer Crunch’s driver—Convict Cracknecke —
took his tall whip and clasped its butt lovingly ;
Overseer Crunch’s “animals” drew up to their
chains.
Twenty couples and one “ unicorn leader” made
up the team. Through the double rank of the
‘‘ animals” ran a light but strong chain. At foot-
intervals along the chain, to a link of doubled
thickness, were attached two swivels, one on either
side, and to every swivel a rope, three feet in
length. livery man of the couples clasped a rope.
The “ unicorn ’man—Tappin, English ex-mayor,
forger, devil—-had even less “ purchase” on the
chain than his comrades. His hands were free,
but a rope passed round his waist, and was fastened
to the end of the chain. He had to perform his
part of the work of haulage by the waist only.
The peculiar advantage of being “ unicorn” (in
the official judgment) was this—that while the
other men had occasionally a chance of “shirking
their puli” without detection, the wretch har-
nessed as solitary “leader” could not relax his
exertions for a second without being found out,
for the slackening of his energies would at once be
apparent in the slackening of his rope.
This was Tappin’s second day in the team, and
his first as unicorn. The team had already made
two journeys up the hill this morning, once with
the eatables and table accessories for the picnic,
and the other with the assistants of Mr. Knatch-
bull and that worthy himself, who was to super-
vise the arrangements at the Dell. On each of
the former trips Convict Tappin had been com-
pelled by sheer weakness to slacken his rope ; but
the vigilance of Overseer Crunch had instantly
perceived this manifestation of incapacity, and
corrected it. Anything like shirking called for a
delicate attention on the part of Driver Crack-
necke.
“Ready, all!” repeated Crunch. Cracknecke,
who had stationed himself opposite the middle
couple, flung out his long lash .
Mrs. Browning almost wished she had not come.
It was really unpleasant to hear a cry of pain,
even though it was only from an “animal.”
* * *
Dp the steep hillside crept the team. It
was going “ slow,” for which the “animals ” were
as thankful as brutes could be, for to go quickly
chafed their ankles the more. A slow pace meant
that at least twenty steps could be taken without
a fresh bit of skin being worn off by the basil;
while a quick step would have fretted open a new
wound every ten paces.
The slow pace gave Mrs. Browning an oppor-
tunity of viewing the noble panorama that spread
itself before her cultivated eye as the waggons
mounted the eminence. Her qualmishness passed
away, lost in admiration. First she expressed her
gratitude to Dr. Grocott for having suggested the
drive to her, and then :
“What an exquisite scene!” she said to Mr.
Scragge. “ How harmonious the blending of the
colours ! Even the yellow uniform of the prisoners
does not seeiri out of place!” The Commandant
agreed.
Mrs. Budgeonhad been making observations of
a different sort.
“ How funny, isn’t it, Doctor,” she remarked to
Grocott, “to watch these men in harness. Like a
huge centipede, aren’t they ?”
“ Only,” laughed the surgeon, “they don’t own
a hundred feet. They have only eighty-two legs
between ’em—and one of those is wooden.”
So they jested—while the team breasted the hill,
under the whip of Driver Cracknecke, and in due
time landed the pic-nicers on the crest of the
ridge. Arrived at the Dell, the pleasure-makers
set about the business of enjoyment without loss
of time.
* * *
At lunch the ladies were profuse in superla-
tives; and even the military merf found it not
inconsistent with their soldierly dignity to express
praise of the spot and the perfection of the
arrangements.
“Ah, demin’d good style Scragge has done this
thing in, hasn’t he ? ” said the Major to Lieu-
tenant Budgeon.
“Yes, sir ; but, then, you know (and the Lieu-
tenant went as near to winking as he dare to his
commanding officer) any one could do the same
who had the run of the Storesd’
“But the Government Stores don’t include
wines, and olives, and—and things.”
The Lieutenant, who had been on the “civil
side ” for a year as locums teiicns at Port Arthur,
smiled a smile of superior intelligence, as befitting
a man who had been behind the scenes.
“ Oh, don’t they, sir ! See that ham—a genuine
Westphalian by the look of it. Now, that would
be probably invoiced by the Hobart Town Store-
keeper to the C.C. here as ‘25 basils,’or, 1 doz.
shirts !’ ”
“ God bless my soul! ” said the Major, “But
surely that’s against the Regulations ? ”
“Well,” was the rejoinder, “I suppose it is.
But it’s done at every convict-station for all that,
as a regular thing.”
_ The probability that he was masticating a por-
tion of a shirt, or a fragment of a basil, did not
prevent the Major’s enjoyment of a slice of the
ham with his chicken, a little later.
A couple of hours after the luncheon, Com-
mandant Scragge suggested they should “chase
the glowing hours with flying feet.” What
he meant was, that they should have a dance.
That splendid organiser, Knatchbull, had foreseen
this —had prepared for it. He had a couple of
convict-violinists in attendance, he had had a part
of the grassy carpet scythe-mowed, he had even
frirnished Mr. Scragge with a programme. Capital
master of the ceremoriies, Knatchbull! The sug-
gestion was welcomed with enthusiasm. Only
Mrs. Browning thought the mown plot was not
large enough to accommodate the dancers.
“ That’s easily reifledied,” said the Comman-
dant ; and he instructed Knatchbull to direct one
of the convict servaiits to pass the scythe over a
larger area;
“ But, sir,” said coolly, “ I’ve
returned the scythe to your gardener. ” Herein
Mr. Knatchbull lied. The scythe had riot been
returned to the Settlement; it was at that very
moment secreted behind a clump of bracken, a
hundred yards away, and within ten feet of the
spot where the tramway-team would take up its
load of.picnicers on their return.
So the Commandant and his guests had to go
on with their dance on the turf as prepared by
Mr. Knatchbull. The spot answered very w r ell
after all; and they went through quite a long list
of dances on that most delightful of ball-rooms ;
and the shadows were lengthening and broadening
into an early twilight before the feet ceased to
twinkle on the yielding verdure, and the fiddles to
throb and thrill.
“A most happy day!” sighed Mrs. Browning
to the Commandant. “I’m sure I shall never
forget it. I can never thank you sufficiently.”
“ I’m sufficiently repaid, madam,” replied that
gallant gentleman, “by the fact that you have
enjoyed yourself.” Really, he thought, he must
not forget to give Convict Knatchbull a glass of
wine !
* * *
For what reason did Convict Knatchbull
secrete that scythe ? True to his instincts, he had
used the freedom granted to him so that he might
prepare for the picnic to “botanise.” On this
occasion, however, it would be the Government
which would suffer if his “ plant” were successful,
and not some poor devil of a prisoner. Convict
Knatchbull had, as a fact, plotted an insurrection.
Like all great conceptions, his plan was simpli-
city itself. The picnic, he reflected, would gather
together every man on the island in superior
authority, military and civil. All these men, with
the exception of Superintendent Darrell, would
return by the trucks at the time. Now, if on the
home trip the trucks could be upset or derailed,
their occupants would almost certainly meet w’ith
a sudden end ! In any case, they would be
disabled, and at the mercy of the insurrectionists.
This w r as Convict Knatchbull’s idea. All that
was necessary to its fulfilment was the co-opera-
tion of the D. Gang—the tramway team. On the
down trip, the waggons were lowered by the team,
and not hauled. If, then, at a given signal the
“animals” let go their ropes, the trucks
would dash to destruction. At the first
curve on the line they would certainly leap
the track, and the people in them would be thrown
or carried down the precipitous height. The rest
would be easy. With the chief authorities dead
or wounded, the subordinate officers at Longridge
and the Cascades, taught by the System to be
mutually distrustful, would find it impossible to
combine, and would submit to the rebels, and the
company of soldiers at the Settlement, deprived
of their officers, would make only the briefest
stand against the freed convicts.
Such was Convict Knatchbull’s plan. He had
used the Commandant’s pass to develope the
scheme more than he had used it for the picnic
preparations. He had broached the project to the
recognised leader of D. Gang—Johnson—care-
fully. Johnson had seen its feasibility but
doubted Knatchbull. “’Nother plant-of
yours, Cap’n John?” he sneeringly asked. “Wot
has old Scragge promised yer this time —a free
pardon ?” Knatchbull, in reply, had sWorn by his
Maker that he was going to be true to the men
this time ; and Johnson consented to consult his
fellow-demons.
“ I don’ b’leeveyer, Knatchbull,” he said, “but I
tell yer this, I can lay a plot, too, an’ I’ll take care
if you trap us this time, yer won’t give Crown
evidunse agen us—dead ’uns don’ tell tales, an’
they don’ give evidunse either. I don’t b’leeve
yer, I say, but I likes th’ plan. If it fails, well,
we’ll swing, o’ corse, but yer’ll be stiff afore we
do.” Knatchbull rejoined that he would take the
risk. He could not know that Convict Johnson
chuckled to himself at the reply ; for let the plot
succeed or fail, Johnson’s notion was to wreak
vengeance on Knatchbull for his former treachery.
It it succeeded Knatchbull should be sacrificed;
it it failed, Knatchbull shouldn’t survive to
“ peach.” Knatchbull, on the other hand,
reasoned that if it succeeded, his resourceful
intellect would be indispensable to the rebels;
while, if it failed, he didn’t doubt that his infernal
ingenuity would secure him immunity from both
the wrath of the authorities and the vengeance of
his fellow-prisoners.
D Gang, to a man—including Tappin—fell in
with the suggestion : the more readily as nearly
all of its members had a personal grudge against
Knatchbull.
* * «
Superintendent Darrell paid his adieux to
the Settlement party as soon as the ladies were
seated in the trucks for the homeward journey.
This was what Knatchbull had counted on. That
villain had been left at the picnicing ground to
complete the packing-up and removal of the
picnic etceteras, but had stayed no longer than
was necessary to lay his hands on everything that
would serve as a weapon of attack.
He had followed the pleasure-makers at a few
minutes’ interval and had stationed himself behind
some stunted guava-trees, whence, in a moment,
he could reach the secreted scythe. The particular
purpose for which he designed that useful and
dangerous article was the disablement of Overseer
Crunch and Driver Cracknecke. He had given
himself an hour’s practice with it and he smiled to
himself as he thought how expertly he could
manage that turn of the wrist by which the for-
ward sweep of the scythe (which was to cut down
Crunch) would be merged into the recoil (which
was to leave a vacancy in the drivership). A
splendid organiser, Knatchbull ! He left nothing
to chance. ®
# * «
“Ready, all!” cried Overseer Crunch
“ Forward !” Craoknecke let his fifteen-foot lasti
leap to the front and then curl to the roar—and the
descent began.
Johnson was “off-side” of the couple next th
second truck. He it was who was to give the
signal to “ let go,” and he tvas in such a pdsitiori
that all iri the gang could observe the signal.
D gang had a secret code of communication of
its own. “No. 98,” in this glossary of rascality
was “Do it—now!” “No. 98” itself was ex’
pressed by the right hand being brought sharply
to the “salute,” three times in rapid succession
Just when the waggons were getting way ’ on
them, at a spot where the wooden parallels took a
sudden dip, Johnson signalled and gave the truck
next him a mighty push.
With a yell, the off-side and near-side rows of
the gang flung their rope-ends to the right and to
the left, and, as quickly as they could with their
fettered legs, got off the track and out of the Wav
of the chain. ™
Freed from the restraint of the men’s pull, and
as though they were animate things, the trucks
paused in their motion—rooked to and fro f or a
second—and then, with a jerk and a jump, rushed
down the breathless decline.
* # #
But what is that dragging at the far end
of the chain ? That, a few yards traversed
slackens its tension on the line of links by a sudden
leap forward ? That, in the same movement, pro-
jects itself (so it seems, in the fast-encroaching
darkness) into the brushwood that borders the
track ? That clasps a young pine, and swings itself
round the bending but stalwart trunk? That
shudders and groans as the chain which binds it
to the waggons feels the resistance—and obeys it—
and compels the trucks, in their turn, to slow
down —to pause—to stop ? What is that thing—
crushed, maimed, bloody ? Oh, that’s the carcase
of Convict Tappin—“ Tappin, of the Ring,” who
in this eccentric fashion, has chosen to violate his
oath to the D Gang, and to foil the skilfully-laid
plans of Convict Knatchbull.
The gang, after one dreadful moment of stupefied
surprise, again yelled, and were about to rush
some towards Tappin, others towards the trucks'
when the report of a pistol was heard above the
shouts, and one of the team stumbled and fell on
the bracken, which he clutched and tore in his
death-struggle.
“Back to your ranks, men; back, I say!”
Darrell, apparently cool, certainly collected, strode
down from the ridge-top and waved them back
with his smoking pistol. Only one firm, courageous
man to withstand that fierce on-rush of devils—
and yet they obeyed him ! Some saw behind
him —shapeless, intangible, but still awful—the
Majesty of British Law ; others—and these were
the majority - concluded that Knatchbull had
“sold” them again, and that behind Darrell
behind the stunted guava-trees and young
pines, was ranged the military strength of the
Settlement. Before they could perceive their
error, the officers in the trucks had forced them-
selves from the shrieking women and had jumped
out. They placed themselves by Darrell’s side.
With Crunch and Cracknecke they formed but a
paltry dozen, and no more than two were armed.
But they represented Authority— and the cowed
wretches slunk back to their files.
Johnson alone retained a hope of carrying the
emeute through. He sent a hurried whisper along
the ranks. Darrell—vain and tyrannical though
he was—was brave to the core. He saw one of
the gang bend his head to his neighbour.
Darrell stepped forward, and gripped him.
“ It’s you, Johnson, is it ? I should have thought
you’d had enough of the gag! You shall have
some more—as a preliminary to the hemp.” He
hauled Johnson out and handcuffed him. He
called the gang to “attention,” and then ordered
them forward to the Barracks. They went like
lambs.
The others then thought of Tappin. Somehow
or other the ladies and children had got out of the
trucks, and the empty waggons alone were held
by the chain to which Tappin was fastened, and to
which he himself had constituted a brake. They
released him —more dead than alive. All, even
the frivolous women, in the shook of their terror,
understood what he had done for them. One or
two tried to thank him ; he cursed them ; he hadn’t
done it for them ; they could have gone to h——
for all he cared ; but he couldn’t bear to be an
accessory to thekilling of that tiny lot. He pointed,
as he muttered the last words, to Nellie Browning.
Not for many days after did they learn, however,
why the presence of the child should have res-
trained him from partnership in a hideous deed.
They found then that the girl, when visiting the
quarry, had smiled him her thanks because he
pulled her some spice-plant. The remembrance of
this incident had determined him, at the last
moment, not to free his rope from the chain
# # *
Darrell’s timely appearance on the scene
was accounted for by the yell which the gang had
raised when they first let their ropes fall. There
was an exultant note in the shout which in-
stinctively spoke to him of revolt, and he rushed
back. But for Tappin, however, he would have
been too late.
The same yell explained why Convict-Writer
Knatchbull did not wield the scythe. He had
grasped it, in readiness for the signal, but the
shout had surprised him—had, indeed, alarmed
him. Splendid organiser as he was, he had not
calculated upon it, and he knew that it would
recall Darrell, and his former quarter-deck experi-
ence reminded him how one bold, resolute man in
authority could quell a mutinous crew. So, in-
stead of mowing down Messrs. Crunch and Crack-
necke, he ran quickly back to the picnicing
ground—and finished packing the plate.
As to the consequences of the emeute , are they
not written in the records of the Special Commis-
sion for the year, and in the black register of the
Island graveyard ? Some time or other wo may
steal a page from both.
