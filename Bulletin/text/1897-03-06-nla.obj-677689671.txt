THOUGH “Lasca” is in America a popular
recitation piece, nothing seems to be known
of its author, nor can any other verses be traced
to him. “Lasca” is said to have originally
appeared in the. English maga. Temple Bar,
and Frank Desprez was possibly a young English-
man ranching (i.e., as a rule, cattle-farming) in
Texas,
LASCA.
I want free life, and I want fresh air ;
And I sigh for the canter after the cattle,
The crack of the whips like shots in a battle,
The melley of horns and hoofs and heads
That wars and wrangles and scatters and spreads ;
The green beneath and the blue above,
And dash and danger, and life and love.
And Lasca!
Lasca used to ride
On a mouse-grey mustang close to my side,
With blue serape and blight-belled spur ;
I laughed with joy as I looked at her 1
Little knew she of books or creeds ;
An ‘ Ave Maria ’ sufficed her needs ;
Little she cared, save to be by my side,
To ride with me, and ever to ride,
From San Saha’s shore to Lavaca’s tide.
She was as bold as the billows that beat;
She, was as wild as the breezes that blow;
From her little head to her little feet
She was swayed in her suppleness to and fro
By each gust of passion ; a sapling pine,
That grows on the edge of a Kansas bluff,
And wars with the wind when the weather is rough,
Is like this Lasca, this love of mine.
She would hunger that I might eat,
Would take the bitter, and leave me the sweet;
But once, when I made her jealous for fun.
At something I’d whispered, or looked, or done,
One Sunday, in San Antonio,
To a glorious girl on the Alamo,
She drew from her garter a dear little dagger,
And—sting of a wasp I—it made me stagger 1
An inch to the left, or an inch to the right,
And I shouldn’t be maundering here to-night;
But she sobbed, and, sobbing, so swiftly hound
Her torn reboso about the wound,
That I quite forgave her. Scratches don’t count
InJTexas', down by the Rio Grande.
Her eye was brown —a deep, deep brown ;
Her hair was darker than her eye ;
And something in her smile and frown,
Curled crimson lip and instep high,
Showed that there ran in each blue vein,
Mixed with the milder Aztec strain,
The vigorous vintage of Old Spain.
She was alive in every limb
With feeling, to the finger-tips;
And when the sun is like a fire.
And sky one shining, soft sapphire,
One does not drink in little sips.
The air was heavy, the night was hot,
I sat by her side, and forgot—forgot;
Forgot the herd that were taking their rest,
Forgot that the air was close opprest,
That the Texas norther comes sudden and soon,
In the dead of night or the blaze of noon ;
That, once let the herd at its breath take fright,
Nothing on earth can stop the flight;
And woe to the rider, and woe to the steed,
Who falls in front of their mad stampede!
Was that thunder ? I grasped the cord
Of my swift mustang without a word.
I sprang to the saddle, and she olung behind.
Away 1 on a hot chase down the wind 1
But never was fox-hunt half so hard,
And never was steed so little spared,
For we rode for our lives. You shall hear how we fared
In Texas, down by the Rio Grande.
The mustang flew,'and we urged him on ;
There was one chance left, and you have but one—
Halt, jump to the ground, and shoot your horse ;
Crouch under his carcass, and take your chance ;
And if the steers in their frantic course
Don’t batter you both to pieces at once,
You may thank your star ; if not, good-bye
To the quickening kiss and the long-drawn sigh,
And the open air, and the open sky.
In Texas, down by the Rio Grande.
The cattle gained on us, and just as I felt
For my old six-shooter, behind in my belt,
Down came the mustang, and down came we.
Clinging together, and—what was the rest T
A body that spread itself on my breast,
Two arms that shielded my flizzy head,
Two lips that hard on my lips were prest;
Then came thunder in my ears,
As over us surged the sea of steers,
Blows that beat blood into my eyes,
And when I could rise—
Lasca was dead.
I gouged out a grave a few teet deep,
And there in Earth’s arms I laid her to sleep;
And there she is lying, and no one knows ;
And the summer shines, and the winter snows.
For many a day the flowers have spread
A pall of petals over her head ;
And the little gray hawk hangs aloft in the air.
And the sly coyote trots here and there,
And the black snake glides and glitters and slides
Into a rift in a cottonwood-tree ;
And the buzzard sails on,
And comes and is gone,
Stately and still like a ship at sea.
And I wonder why I do not care
For the things that are like the things that were.
Does half my heart lie buried there,
In Texas, down by the Eio Grande ?
FRANK DERPRE[?]
C CONSIDERATION of Alex. Montgomery’s
j book of stories (published by Geo. Robertson
and Co.) brings the reflection that no one among
local writers has a better talent for crisp, clean
narrative, with the words cunningly chosen and
placed to give greatest effect in least compass, and
the balanced sentences ringing like anvil-strokes.
A weary editor, one-half whose time is employed
in linking relatives to antecedents, gathering up
sprawling sentences, and digging a half-expressed
thought from a mass of clumsy verbiage, is perhaps
inclined to welcbme too warmly the man who
writes like this—
Across the long perspective of the mangrove flats the
sun glared fierce and crimson. From the black mud-
banks, white, pestilential vapours rose upon the torpid
air. A subtler miasm quivered over the long stretches
of mephitic ooze, against the sickly green of which
gleamed out the hideous reds and yellows of fantastic
crabs that scuttled-as the boat came near—into pools
prismatic with stagnation. Beneath the slimy surface
the banded water-snakes glanced to and fro ; from the
reed-beds came in hungry swarms the tiger-mosquitoes ;
and from the mangrove roots the sword-flies darted out
in swift detachments upon the half-nude rowers—swelter-
ing in a bath of vegetable fetor.
> » * *
This is not the best prose : it is too hard and
metallic, too lacking in softness and sympathy;
and the hardly-varied cadences grow monoto-
nous. English prose is becoming, on the whole,
less musical than it was for Sir Thomas
Browne and Sir Walter Raleigh. The Macaul-
ayan wave has submerged it : it is as glitter-
ing as you please, but too terse, too regular,
too staccato, to give the finest stimulus. Mont-
gomery wants the luxury, the melody, the magic
of writers like (say) De Quineey or Scevenson.
His pages fall as stiffly as a carven toga : theirs are
often a garment closely woven to the thought. De
Quineey’s sentences ripple like water now in
shade and now in shine ; Montgomery’s are fixed
in the glare of an unwinking noon. But there is
no mistaking their illumination ; his is an ideal
journalistic style. The lucid rhythm of, e.g.—
Across the long perspective of the mangrove flats the
sun glared fierce and crimson—
is a craftsman’s joy. To write so you must have
clear thought, a knack of words, and a good ear
(not necessarily delicate). Try it in other ways—
Over the long perspective of the mangrove flats the sun
glared fierce and crimson.
Across the perspective of the mangrove flats the sun
glared fierce and crimson.
Across the long perspective of the mangrove flats the
sun glared crimson and fierce.
Across the long perspective of the mangrove flats the
sun shone fierce and crimson.
Re-combine or alter these words in half-a-hundred
ways, and each time you tall short, in cadence or
meaning, of Montgomery’s result. Yet originally,
doubtless, the phrases shaped themselves in his
mind almost without effort. There was possibly
verbal emendation —little or much —but the form
and swing of the sentence came as if by instinct.
This is what it is to be able to write.
* * * »
But study the sentence further, and see why,
e.g., “over” will not do instead of “aoross” in
the first alternative given. It will not do, first,
because it has not the direct, sweeping meaning
of “ across ” in relation to the rays of the level
sun. With “over,” the glare hangs in the air;
with “across” it is down touching the ground,
lighting up the mangrove flats, as they must be
lighted up if the mind is to absorb the whole pic-
ture. And it will not do, second, because “ over ”
is a trochee and “across” an iambus, and the
rhythm of the sentence is markedly iambic.
Acrdss the 16ng perspective 6f the mangrove flits the
Siin glared fierce and crimson.
The iambics are not perfect; but this is the way
in which the average person would unconsciously
accent these words —stressing “ of ” and slurring
“grove’’and “glared.” And on examination a
well-marked preference for iambic rhythm will be
found running through all Montgomery’s prose.
Here is a sentence from “Her Father’s Head,”
describing the interior of a Dyak head-house—
Around the circle of the roof, in close and curving
rows, the monstrous trophies hung—dim blots of greater
darkness in the shadow, but starting out, in patches
where the white light fell, into hideous caricature of
humanity, with huge blank orbits where were one time
eyes, and shark-mouths grinning to the moon in ghastly
travesty of laughter.
Accented —
Aroiind the circle 6t the r6of in clAss and cdrving rAws
the grisly trAphies hiing . . .
but Stirling Aut in pitches wh Are the white light fAll.. .
with hhge black Arbits whAre were Ane time eyes . . ».
These fragments would pass in iambic verse, and
even the omitted phrases are iambic in character,
peppered with a few weak syllables to prevent
them from falling into the affectation of prose
verse.
* • * *
It is interesting (and quite unprofitable in the
absence of evidence) to speculate on the physical
reasons of Montgomery’s marked iambic prefer-
ence. Possibly his heart is weaker in systole
than in diastole : instead of a regular lub-dub it
beats a biassed lup-dub—quaver-orotchet in lieu
of crotchet-crotchet. Thus in a slight valve-weak-
ness, making a permanent change in the ear-
pulses, one might find the cause of the strong beat,
the monotonous music of his prose.
« * * *
The bias is unconscious, of course ; for it is nob
consistent with the best effects for which Mont-
gomery strives. The treasury of prose is far too
rich to open to a single key. The regular rhythms
which the popular ear demands in verse are in
prose inadmissible —not because mere dogma bars
them, but because in the result—which is the test
of their artistic value—they spoil the prose. Some
passages held as exceptions are of doubtful
authority. The familiar death of “little Nell,”
for example, is in parts effective writing, but it is
not good prose. Ingersoll tells why. (He is
speaking of poetry, but the dictum applies a for-
tiori to prose.)
I do not mean by rhythm a recurring accent at accur-
ately measured intervals. Perfect time is the death of
music. There should always be room for eager haste and
delicious delay . . .
Yet through much of Ingersoll’s work—and he
has composed some of the most notable rhetorical
prose in English—the regular iambic rhythm
beats strongly. The speech “ At a Child’s Grave ”
begins—
My Friends: I kn6w how vdin it is to gild a grief with
words, and y<st I wish to take from 6very grave its fdar.
Here in this wdrld, where life and d6ath are 6qual kings,
all should be brive enoiigh to mbet what All the dead have
mAt.
Dickens also runs to iambics when he purples.
As in the passage referred to —
Of Avery tAar that sdrrowing mortals shAd onsiich green
graves, some go6d is bdrn, some gAntler nAture cdmes.
So that Montgomery errs in good company
And curious readers who examine further may be
surprised to find what a grip the rhythmic iambus
has on modern English prose, when the prosers
wish to be especially forceful. The cause ?
JANUARY Cosmopolitan prints an interest-
ing article describing the making of an ideal
newspaper by an enthusiast to whom a millionaire
gave a free hand. Says the millionaire’s agent
to the enthusiast—
‘ You are like a great many newspaper writers that I
have met. You have in your mind an ideal newspaper,
while your lives are spent in writing for anything but ideal
newspapers.’
• That is true. I never saw a man yet who thoroughly
admired the newspaper for which he worked, except the
proprietor.’
An obvious retort is that this is inevitable, since
ideals differ widely, and even if the man with the
best ideal became proprietor his subordinates
would not thoroughly admire his ideal newspaper.
But this retort is not fully satisfactory. There is
among intelligent journalists a certain unanimity
of opinion as to what is a good paper, just as there
is among intelligent readers a certain unanimity
of opinion regarding standard authors—though
one may have an individual preference for fiction,
another for history, and so on.
* * * *
The enthusiast proceeds—
•ln plain words, I have not been able to treat myself to
the luxury of expressing my own opinions in black and
white for a number of years. As a reporter and cor-
respondent I have been obliged to color my facts, more
or less, to suit the newspaper which employed me. No
matter how impartial an editor may think he is, and
whatever may be the directions given by him to his re-
porters or subordinates, they thoroughly understand that
their popularity and their prospect for advancement
depend largely upon their collecting the facts and views
which will have a tendency to substantiate the actual
views of their employer. Aside from this personal ques-
tion, the average newspaper has a fixed set of ideas.
Whether they relate to mere partisanship or mere assump-
tion of independence, the suboidinates have but the
freedom of men engaged in working on a chain gang.
The person who seeks to make his individuality too
marked soon becomes an object of criticism, and the
moment the readers of a newspaper begin to complain to
the editor, through that wonderful column known as the
people’s column, there comes a warning, and if the warn-
ing is not heeded, loss of employment.’
‘You put yourself in a very critical attitude toward
the newspapers. Is it true, then, that you have found in
the exercise of your profession neither pleasure nor intel-
lectual profit ?’
‘ Neither. The practice of modern journalism has no
tendency to bring out the best qualities of the individual.
Men are moulded after a certain pattern, according to
the newspaper employing them, and individuality is dis-
tinctly discouraged. Journalism is a trade ; no one
should call that a profession which eats up the best life
of a man. When he should be arriving at the years of
his greatest value, in almost any other occupation of life,
' in this one exacting, nerve-exhausting calling he finds
himself growing less and less valuable, and is soon pointed
out by the youngsters as only fit for the purpose of writ-
ing reminiscences.’
Many journalists will endorse this to some extent.
* » * •
And there is truth in this, from an intellectual
standpoint :
‘You have doubtless studied art, and therefore compre-
hend the technical meaning of the term called ‘values’
—that is, the scale of proper proportion of things. This
constitutes the chief merit of great pictures. It seems
to me that the modern newspaper lacks this quality more
than it does anything else. There is a lack of the proper
sense of proportion. The subjects which are thrust to
the front in the order of their publication often are ex-
aggerated beyond the power of their true perspective
Let me give you an instance. Let us suppose that a
janitor, a highly esteemed janitor in charge of some res-
pectable up town flat, becomes weary of the routine of hit
life and deserts his family to elope with some interesting
chambermaid in the neighborhood. Now there is a story
which in a great many modern newspapers would be pre-
sented with about the same spread-eagle display that
should be accorded to the news of a foreign war. In my
judgment, infractions of the law are made altogether too
conspicuous. By this I mean that stories of crime and
stories of exposure should have their place in the news-
paper, but it does not seem to me chat they should occupy
the front place ; and where the people are of humble and
ordinary life, their peccadilloes, misdemeanors or crimes
should not entitle them to furnish more than their men-
tion, and then only when they fall into the hands of the
law and are actually dealt with by the courts.’
* * • *
Intellectually, this is correct; journalistically,
it is fallacious.' The average newspaper is issued
to make money —chiefly through advertisements.
To secure advertisements it must have ‘circula-
tion’; to secure ‘circulation’ it must please its
patrons ; to please its patrons it must give them
what they like to read. In America, Aus-
tralia, and elsewhere, the number of persons who
see events in their true human perspective is
small; in the area which, e.g., a single daily news-
paper can expect to cover it is very small. Ninety-
five per cent, of female readers, perhaps 70 per
cent, of male readers in Sydney, say, are pro-
foundly impressed by events which happen near
them, and not at all impressed by infinitely
more important events (to the human race)
which happen a long way off. The educated
mind may be cosmopolitan, but the unedu-
cated mind is parochial; and probably four-
fifths of the people among whom the average
daily newspaper finds its purchasers are almost
wholly uneducated. If the paper would prosper
it must “ hit them where they live’’—give them
Butler and bicycles instead of bimetallism and im-
aginative Art.' The Sydney and Melbourne even-
ing papers, which have some sensational reputa-
tion, are possibly as intellectual as they can afford
to be. The pressure to heighten intellectual status
is small in proportion to the pressure to lower it.
Every fresh intellectual step in advance would
probably mean a shrinkage in subscriptions. It is
to the credit of Australian editors that, as a class,
they probably make their papers quite as intel-
lectual as their public will permit. Probably the
papers are rather above than below the standard
which the mass of the public prefers. And pro-
bably the average public standard—for a variety
of interesting reasons—is in Australia a little
higher than in America or even than in England ;
whence the compliments frequently paid by
foreign visitors to the Australian press.
gOMB LITTLE ITEMS.
They say Hubert Crackanthorpe’s exit was by way of
suicide. Certain letters found on the body have been
suppressed. Last seen with ‘a woman at Bordeaux.*
After that the Seine.
Kipling’s new long story, ‘ Captains Courageous,’
now running in a couple of the magazines, is readable—
nothing more. It is a diary of his experiences on a New-
foundland cod-fishing schooner, hung on the slightest peg
of plot—little more than a boy’s story, in fact; clever
and vigorous as Kipling’s work must be, but imperman-
ent and not (on the high plane) artistic.
Quiller Couch succeeds Zangwill as Pall Mall Maga-
zine commentator. ‘Q.’ is a pretty prattler, but he has
not the pith and force of Zangwill; and he is no critic—has
no sense of proportion. Too good-natured, perhaps ; for
he is friends with everybody, and no sooner does a
chum’s rushlight splutter than he all-hails my lord the
Sun. Your conscientious critio is almost of necessity a
sour, malevolent fellow with an evil eye—like Javert or
the incorruptible Robespierre—who pitilessly damns,
when it deserves it, the book of the man he has just
dined with.

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-emi-
nence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally a household word ;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed in an
acute or chronic case of long standing, where other physicians
have failed. He addresses himself in particular to cases that
have baffled the skill and science of other doctors. His name
is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he
undertakes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to your
life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best friend
and benefactor. If you are troubled with want of sleep, a
tired gloomy feeling, and loss of energy, which impair both
your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you for study,
business, or.the proper enjoyment of life ; if you are suffering
from these or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before
it is everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat it
with unfailing success.
MIDDLE-AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching back
and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and vigor,
and not unfrequently accompanied by an impairment of the
general health. In justice to this celebrated specialist it can
be truthfully stated that in all such cases of middle-aged
men, as well of young men, his success has been almost
invariable.
Troubles at every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of any institution in Australia—female complaints,
liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, bladder, kidney and heart
disease ; rupture, piles, fistula, hydrocele and kidney troubles.
VARICOCELE.

press, price £2. Constitutional or acquired weaknesses

CONSULTATION is free to all, but where £1 is enclosed a careful diagnosis of the oase will be made, and

SURGEON LANGSTON. A friendly letter or call may save future suffering. New edition of my'latest work, “ Mens
Sana in Gorpore Sano,” nearly 100 pages, sent free to men.

study of
Private, Nervous and Skin Diseases.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-

candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing

Perhaps you are one who only thinks of the
UTILITIES, one who eschews everything but
what is strictly necessary. You’ve a penchant
for FLANNELS, but have a DERRY on SILKS
and when there’s HOMESPUN about you can’t
see the occasion for bothering about PLUSH and
VELVET. Simple and good is your motto ;
you’re almost a Quaker, though not quite, and
you d rather see your money in the bank than on
your back, and dividends are better, say you, than
Ribbons and Laces. Wei], have your own way.
We provide for all sorts and sizes.
Or perhaps you are of another class. A world-
ling, if you will, floating down the stream of life,
with ‘ ‘ youth at the prow and pleasure at the
helm, you want to dress well and to look well.
The eyes of the fair are upon you, and you would
win their smiles. You want Clothes and Hats
and Boots, Gloves you must have, and a thousand
other things you crave for. Rings, Lockets,
Gems, exquisite Neckties, Shirts galore, good
CIGARS, and TOBACCO of the best. You’d
like them all, wouldn’t you ? You can have them,
sir, at our store for what is, when compared to
what other stores are asking, a mere song.

And your very fingers shakin’

And the agent finds the spots out
And takes all his sample lots out
Where it’s rusty, pinched, or smutty—knockin’ off

Sling ’em over with a jerk! slide along ! slide

IRON ROOFS AND COUNTRY SCHOOL-
BOYS.
In a lonely backblocks school-house with the fierce
sun’s blood-red eye
Looking down in sullen anger from a smoky,
brazen sky,
With the bush-fires raging round us, and the only
breeze that blows
A sirocco from the north-west hot enough to singe
your clothes.
Here, amid my two-score charges, I an instant
meditate
On the blessings of instruction, and the wisdom of
a State
So extremely persevering in its zeal to educate
That it crowds some forty youngsters (sometimes
less and sometimes more)
In an iron-roofed slab shanty fifteen feet by
twenty-four,
With three pigeon-hole-like windows and a narrow
crazy door,
And the mercury just threatening to run over on
the floor.
Oh, those cursed iron roofings ! How they frizzle
up the brain
Of the schoolboy generation, making education
vain:
Surely Satan in his cunning and determination
fell
To blast Young Australia’s genius must have
sent them up from hell,
And our legislative Solons —ever Satan’s ready
tools —
Took them meekly, and pronounced them “Pro-
per roofings for our schools.”
And I fear me that the schoolboy, tough and
thick-skulled though he be,
Must go under in the struggle, and I very plainly
see
That, with broiling him in summer, and with
freezing him in June,
If these iron roofs continue there will be no
schoolboy soon.
He’ll be frizzled up and frozen off the surface of
the earth,
And the “ sylvan glades ” no longer will “ re-echo
with his mirth.”
But ’tis not for me to grumble, or your sympathy
implore,
For the doomed Australian schoolboy—l’m his
teacher —nothing more.
And “the standard” hangs before me, and free
standard measure must
Be poured into every youngster if old Fahrenheit
should “ bust.”
PEDAGOGUE.
WHERE THE LOST MEN GO.
O land of desire ! 0 land of a dream !
Where the rivers fret their gold ;
We see in the morning your waters gleam
With the light that tempts the bold ;
We gaze at noon-tide and dream o’ nights
On your mountains tipped with snow ;
There are dark recesses and dazzling heights
In the land where the lost men go.
There are shining plain-lands and tangled shades,
And echoing caverns cool,
And stretching forests and sun-lit glades,
And many a lilied pool ;
There are windy ridges and tropic calms,
And the long tides ebb and flow
Over coral reefs, by island palms,
To the land where the lost men go.
But to us who follow the brave lost men
This land seems faint and far ;
The sun sets o’er it each eve again,
And above it throbs one star.
Shall we reach them ever, those men who led—
We who follow and follow so ?
It is always a long day’s march ahead
To the land where the lost men go.

The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a Pric© TJU'
kHOWII H6r6 a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Yuelta Abajo).
i- ' »
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d.!!— will at first no doubt
be prejudicial ; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done.
The “ BONANZA”
eomes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
No|e-— Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any

The Federal Railway Problem.
The story told by the Prudent Federationists
-—otherwise the Mangy Dog party—about the
inevitable loss of traffic on the New South
Wales railways if the lines are put under
Federal management, and the awful results
that will ensue thereupon, receives a bad
shock from some recent articles in Sydney
Telegraph. The railway problem has now de-
finitely asserted itself as the biggest stumbling-
block in the way of Federation. The princi-
pal reasons why the lines should be put under
Federal management and be bossed by one
central authority are these three. In the
first place, it will result in the establishment
of a uniform gauge, and thereby reduce ex-
penses, facilitate commerce by saving much
useless loading and unloading, and economise
rolling stock, Secondly, it will cause new
railways to be constructed so as to lead to the
nearest port instead of to the capital of the
province, and do away with the insane sys-
tem whereby the producer is denied access
to the port 200 miles distant in the next pro-
vince, and compelled to send his goods to the
one 450 miles distant in his own province.
And, thirdly, it will do away with the ruinous
war of rates on the borders, and thus effect
another much-needed economy. And against
this the Prudent Federation element in
three provinces tells a disastrous legend of
how/Federal railway management will take
trade away from every place and reduce
every place to utter ruin. In New South
Wales it is alleged that the Riverina
trade will go to Melbourne and the
Western trade to Adelaide, and Sydney will
become a desert. In Victoria it is ajleged
that the Western trade will go to Adelaide,
ail'd that the trade of New South Wales
beyond the Darling, much of which is now
dragged by great labor and ingenuity to Mel-
bourne, will revert to Sydney. In South
Australia it is pointed out that that province
has the Barrier trade already, but a Federal
management will probably complete the
Cobar line to Broken Hill as part ©f a new
railway policy, and then this business will
go overland to the east coast, where coal for
smelting purposes is plentiful, and South
Australia will be lost and ruined and de-
serted. The principal trouble, however,
lies between New South Wales and Victoria ,
and the third province may, for the moment,
be left out of consideration.
* * * *
Under the present conditions there is a
constant struggle on the part of each railway
management to drag trade to its own big
port at almost any cost. The competition
began in a small way, and grew by degrees
till it became a mania. At first the exports
of New South Wales south of Junee, or a
point somewhere thereabouts, were mostly
shipped via Melbourne because it was the
nearest port. Then specially low rates were
offered to induce the trade to go via Sydney,
and Victoria offered still lower rates to bring
it back to Melbourne. After that larger
and larger reductions wer§ offered on both
sides, till each party was willing to carry the
goods of the people of this Debateable Land
at a dead loss, out of pure cussedness, and
solely to prevent the hated individual
across the border from getting the job.
The Victorian railways, as the Telegraph
points out, will carry goods of a certain class
from Melbourne to Wodonga in Victorian
territory, a distance of 188 miles, for £.5
10s. per ton. It will carry the same goods
from Melbourne to Wagga, in New South
Wales, a distance of 268 miles, for £3 3s. 4d.
per ton. This rate is a dead loss, therefore
the tremendous charge of £5 10s. has to be
levied on the miserable Victorian to help
make up the deficiency. If the Victorian
Department abandoned the effort to drag
New South Wales trade to Melbourne at any
cost, and ceased carrying the goods of outsiders
almost gratis for the sake of pure aggrava-
tion, it could convey the goods of its own
people at a lower rate and relieve them of a
serious burden. New South Wales pursues
the same frantic policy. A ton of wheat
goes by rail from Albury to Melbourne for
15s. Bd., so the New South Wales Depart-
ment carries it to Sydney —fully twice the
distance—for 13s. 4d., and on a rough esti-
mate it loses 10s. on the deal. Machinery
is carried from Melbourne to Albury (190
miles) at £5 12s. per ton, while it is carried
from Sydney to Albury (387 miles) for £5
ss. 3d. Some goods are carried from Syd-
ney over that same 387-mile journey, at as
little as one-half the rate charged for the 190
mile journey from Melbourne. To make up
for this loss enormously heavy rates are
charged of necessity to the New South Wales
inhabitant in localities where there is no
outside competition. A great deal of the
prosperity of the Riverina is due to the fact
that each province carries its goods for next
to nothing in order to get ahead of the other
fellow, and taxes other people to make up
the loss. Riverina is a blessed place that is
subsidised at the expense of both New South
Wales and Victoria, and a good part of the
railway deficit in both provinces is due to
the scramble for a trade which is of no
earthly value to either at present rates.
* * * •
In the Western district of New South
Wales the struggle is of an even more
desperate character. The New South Wales
lines from Bourke and Cobar carry goods at
unprofitable rates to drag the trade to
Sydney. The Victorian Department carries
them at still more unprofitable rates to drag
commerce Melboi r )e-wards. The local in-
habitant, however, gains very little, whereas
both Victoria and New South Wales lose
heavily. The shortest and cheapest outlet is
by river towards South Australia, but the
lower reaches of the river are systematically
left unsnagged and more or less unnavigable
to prevent trade going out of the province,
and there are no railways leading westward.
Therefore, some of the annual crop is
laboriously and expensively conveyed to
Bourke, and carried thence to Sydney at
a specially cheap rate. And another part
is taken to Swan Hill and carried thence
to Melbourne at about one-third the re-
gular charge, the other two-thirds being
knocked off to make it worth the
owner’s while to get his wool to the Vic-
torian border, therefore that province may
be said to carry it gratis half the journey
in order that it may enjoy the privilege of
carrying it at a reduced rate for the other
half. The Swan Hill line doesn’t pay in-
terest on cost, but by charging heavy rates to
the luckless Victorian producer it is made to
cover working expenses and a portion of the
interest. It would probably pay a good deal
better without the trade from western New
South Wales, and it is almost certain that
one at least of the New South Wales lines—
the ruinous Hay extension —would pay
better without it also. If, under a Federal
management which took no account of pro-
vincial capitals, the far western pastoralists
were furnished with the most direct possible
communication with the nearest South Aus-
tralian port, they could pay freights which
would cover the cost of transit and yet be
cheaper than the desperately-reduced rates
now charged to Sydney and Melbourne ; the
New South Wales and Victorian lines would
only lose a traffic which costs more than it
yields;,by losing it they would be able to
reduce freights to the population wdthin their
legitimate sphere and also reduce the annual
deficit; and there would be a gain to every-
body concerned.
A good part of this debateable western
region, however, is nearer to Sydney than to
either Melbourne or any South Australian
port. And as a Federal management would.
necessarily put an end to differential rates,
and establish a uniform tariff according to
distance, it would emphatically shut down on
the absurd Victorian competition over a
large part of this area. A good deal of trade
which now goes to Melbourne at ruinous
rates would go instead to Sydney at payable
ones. Also, a good deal of trade which now
goes to Sydney, at rates which don’t cover
expenses, would still go there, only at rates
which would cover expenses. Until a
railway is built running northward
from Swan Hill, which isn’t likely to
happen for many years, Victorian competition
would be abolished over something like half
of the West, and the trade of almost all that
district would coine Sydney-wards. When
such a line is built, Victorian competition
would still be shut out from about one-third
of the country now disputed by the two pro-
vinces. Sydney would gain a great deal in
the immediate present, and Victoria would
be all the richer for what it would lose. In
the South, Sydney would lose some trade,
and as the trade is carried at a dead loss its
railway system would be much better off for
losing it. Under provincial management the
business of the two debateable lands in the
South and West profits absolutely nobody
save the people whose goods are carried
largely at the expense of their neighbors.
And it doesn’t always benefit even them,
as is shown by the situation out West,
where in the struggle to drag certain
unprofitable bales of wool to two ports,
neither of which is the natural outlet of the
country, egress to a third one, much nearer
than either, is practically barred. When the
producers around Sydney and Melbourne
realise that they are paying exorbitant
freights to cover the loss incurred in the
scramble for the border trade—that they, as
a matter of fact, are carrying at their own
expense the wool and w'heat and machinery
of other people whom they don’t know, and
never saw, and take no manner of interest in
—then the demand for Federal railway
ownership, or at least a Federal railway
tariff, will become peremptory. Nothing
else, apparently, can end the trouble. Where
two rival managements meet they can no
more refrain from reaching out for each
other’s traffic than the fighting Indian of the
old picturesque days could from reaching out
for the scalp of the other Indian across the
border. And now each management has got
the scalp of the other and has lost its own,
and the situation is mutually unsatisfactory.
The Great Life Insurance Mystery.
It is vaguely rumored that the Victorian
Government intends next session, or at some
other early date, to pass an enactment for the
regulation of life insurance societies. If it
carries out this purpose, and if its law fills the
requirements of the case, it will do a great and
much-needed work for which it will get
very little thanks and inevitably much exe-
cration. The managers, directors and other
officials of those existing insurance offices which
can’t stand too close inspection, and whose
liberty must needs be seriously interfered with,
will supply the execration ; the absence of any
adequate thankfulness will come from the
public which doesn’t understand the danger it
is in, and will be but little grateful to the
Government which rescues it therefrom. In
some respects the people, as regards insurance
matters, are in much the same position as they
•were as regards banking matters seven years
ago. Had the Turner-Isaacs Government
been in power in 1890, and passed its Com-
panies Act then, and if it had thereby averted,
so far as its jurisdiction went, the crash of ’93,
its legislation would have been merely regarded
as a piece of officious meddling. It could never
have proved that a crash would have come but
for its interference, therefore it couldn’t have
proved that its measure was really required.
The situation with regard to life insurance
business is something similar just now. No
serious crash has come, therefore no one can
prove to the multitude by ocular demonstration
that legislation is needed. When it is proved
it will be rather late for interference, but not
too late for a great sensational advt. There-
fore the Government which acts in time is likely
to get little support, whereas the one which
acts too late, with events as evidence on its
side, will probably get a great deal.
* * * *
Life assurance, to the average individual, is
as profound a mystery as the nature of things
at the back of Jupiter. Even with access to
all the affairs of an insurance office—with all its
records at hand and with unlimited time to
inspect them—only an expert in this particular
art can tell, in 99 per cent, of cases, whether an
office is solvent or not. Such experts are very
few. Of that few one or two are paid to inves-
tigate the affairs of each office and report on
the condition to which the directors have
brought it. The directors, as a rule, are men
of great influence in business circles—men of
the class on whom the expert depends for his
livelihood, and it is by no means his interest to
quarrel with them. There is no regular over-
haul by men who do not depend on the direc-
tors and people of their class for a livelihood—
in other words, there is no State audit. If the
private auditor does report that things are
wrong —w'hich he never does—he has no power
to put them right; he can only appeal through
the press—if it will publish his appeal—to the
great, scattered, helpless, unwieldy mass of
shareholders to rise up against the directors
and put things right. Also, he can only appeal
to them by explaining highly technical matters
in language which 999 out of every 1000 don’t
understand. Worst of all, except in some ex-
ceedingly glaring case, he can’t say himself that
there is anything certainly wrong. There is no
recognised definition of right and wrong in the
matter, and the law prescribes no standard of
solvency. Every office makes its own standard
of solvency, within certain limits, and it
naturally employs one by which it is solvent.
Therefore it is solvent.
There are still people who regard a bank as a
place where you insert your money, to be
stored in a safe until you want to draw it out
again, and who have a vague idea that a banker,
in some incomprehensible way, earns interest,
rent, working expenses, dividends, &c., simply
by keeping the money in a safe. Also, there
are people who vaguely imagine that a solvent
life office is one which has, say, a million
pounds of insurance in force, and a million
pounds to pay them with. The full incom-
prehensibleness of the business is a mystery to
the great majority, and even the fact that a
balance-sheet, however accurate, is, beyond a
certain point, no guide at all as to the solidity
or otherwise of the office is known to very few.
The question of solvency mainly depends on
the following considerations. The funds on
hand at a given date are so much. The
insurances in force, all of which, it must
be assumed, will ultimately have to be paid
in full, are so much. The annual premium
income thereon is so much. The ages
of the persons insured are various. The
average number of years each will live is a
matter to be decided by certain estimates
based on long experience. Therefore, those
whose premiums are payable for life will live
and pay premiums for a certain number of
years on an average. Those whose policies
are payable on the endowment plan will
also pay premiums for a certain number of
years which have to be estimated in
the same fashion. These premiums will ac-
cumulate, less a certain estimated outlay for
working expenses for the average number of
years already alluded to. The accumulation
will yield compound interest at a certain rate,
which is fixed by striking an average among
certain known and assumed circumstances. A
certain margin must be allowed for losses
through bad investments. So much in life
insurance to be paid a certain estimated number
of years hence, under all these conditions, is
equal, as ascertained by certain profound calcu-
lations, to a certain liability payable now. If
the assets in hand equal that present liability,
then the office is solvent, provided the assets-
are real, and sufficient allowance has been made
for bad investments. Otherwise, it isn’t.
These, with several dozen other complications
based on annuities, tontine policies, trust and
debenture policies, children’s endowments,
mortuary dividend policies, &c., thrown in, are
the basis of the question of solvency in life
insurance business.
* * * *
Every life office that The Bulletin ever
heard of is—and always was—solvent, by its
own showing. Only a stupendous fool of an
qffice would not be solvent, considering the
latitude allowed in Australia. The estimated
duration of life varies considerably, according
to different authorities, and, by taking the
most favorable table, the estimated amount to
be received in premiums before the bill has to
be paid can be considerably expanded. It can
be assumed that the accumulated funds will
bear interest at almost any rate. One English
office estimates future interest at 2 per cent,
only. Australian offices estimate and 4 per
cent., as a rule. One Australian office is re-
puted to have once filled an awkward gap
by estimating future interest at 6 per
cent., and the difference bet.ween these
extremes is so wide that one way an in-
surance office might be shown to be insolvent
with £1,000,000 in hand, while the other it
might show itself to be perfectly solvent with
the same liabilities and only £700,000 or so to
meet them. The amount to be allowed for
working expenses may be put at a much lower
figure than the real expense rate, if it is neces-
sary to make ends profess to meet somehow.
Also, the present assets may be swelled by not
writing off bad investments, or £50,000 worth
of bricks and mortar may be written up to
£IOO,OOO on the ground that “ values have gone
up.” If £50,000 is wrongfully added on to
property-values on the ground that an alleged
rise has taken place, and £50,000 more that has
been lost by bad investments is not written off,
the apparent assets are swelled by £IOO,OOO of
non-existent money. And when it is estimated
that the funds will yield 4 per cent, interest,
this means taking credit in the future for an
income of £4OOO a year that will never be real-
ised. And, through taking for granted this
£4OOO a year income for the future, a bankrupt
office may show a beautiful state of solvency.
By assuming assets that don’t really exist, and
assuming a higher interest rate and a lower ex-
pense rate and a longer duration of life than
are at all reasonable, any insurance institution
can persuade the public that it is sound, and
do a big business, and declaresensational bonuses
out of profits which seem to be there but are
not, and have a good time generally.
* * * *
The public, being utterly unable to fathom
the mystery of the business, takes an insur-
ance office mostly on its own valuation.
One Australian office which is now getting
along rapidly charges the lowest pre-
miums in Australia, uses a larger propor-
tion of them in expenses than any other
office, and pays about the biggest bonuses
going ; and the public judges it solely by its
low charged and its big bonuses, and knows
nothing about the interior working of things.
Another which is now booming handsomely got
round an awkward corner some years ago by
enormously writing up the nominal value of its
city property, and, so far as all the visible
information goes, thereby just saved itself from
showing a very heavy deficit. A third, which
kept itself absolutely solvent and honest by
heavily writing down the value of its assets to
cover depreciation arising through the bursting
of the boom, and sacrificed most of its bonus
to do so, fell into such disfavor through its
obtrusive soundness and honesty that its new
business diminished very badly. The present
system attracts business to the office which is
run on a reckless policy that points towards
ultimate disaster, and to a great extent scares
it away from the one which is conducted
on absolutely sound and cautious principles.
What is required is that the State shall pre-
scribe the rate of interest to be assumed (which
should not exceed 3£ per cent.) and the method
of valuation, that a State officer shall periodi-
cally audit the accounts to see that its rules
are strictly adhered to, and that he shall als?


periodically examine and value the assets, and
report on the surplus or alleged surplus. In
short, what is wanted is a system by which all
offices shall be solvent or insolvent according
to the same fixed standard. At present every
office is solvent according to its own standard,
which is quite a different matter.

Several people—quite a lot of people, in fact—
have sent round since the above ticket was
first announced to point out its many defects.
It has been objected to because it didn’t contain
enough Catholics, and enough Protestants, and
enough Protectionists, and enough Freetraders,
and enough Labor men ; also, because it in-
cludes three Ministers in some provinces and
only two in another ; because Sargood is in it ;
because Purves, Lyne, See, Moran, Cope-
land, Crick, Brunker, Heydon, -MTntyre,
Gillies, Solomon, Copley, and three dozen
others are not in it, and because some weak
little men are included and many big strong
ones left out. To all these objections The Bul-
letin replies in a very few words : It has
certain distinct convictions as to what a Federa-
tion should be, as set forth in its “Federal
Constitution” published in the issue of January
23 —its main ideas being that there should be
two Houses both elected on the basis of one
adult one vote, the Referendum, a system
whereby deadlocks can be averted, elective
ministries, that the Commonwealth should take
over the public debts, railways, posts, tele-
graphs, defences, military forces, &c., bodily as
they stand, that provincial borrowing shall be
absolutely prohibited, and many other things. Its
forty candidates are the men who, so far as it
could gather from their speeches and writings,
are most likely to bring about its ideal Com-
monwealth. The theory that the Convention
should consist of the 40 biggest men in Aus-
tralian politics, regardless of their opinions, is
absurd. Ho one wants an army of 40 generals
and no privates. If the Convention contains
ten leaders who can draw up a really sensible
Constitution and 30 other men who will back it
with a reliable vote, it is much better than if it
contained 40 big men, who held w'idely diverse
opinions, and who were all too big to follow
anybody’s lead. Moreover, the big men are
not necessarily the men of brains. They are
mostly the old Parliamentary hands, the men
with money and influence, wdio know how to work
the road and bridge vote, the sectarian vote, the
Orange, or Masonic, or National Ass vote, who
advertise themselves deftly at banquets and
functions, the great borrowers and Dead-house
builders, and the men who whoop for the
Queen and get up loyal displays, and buy news-
paper support with timely concessions. The
Bulletin considers that, in individual intelli-
gence, its nominees compare favorably with
most of the large, disappointing political me-
gatheriums who are left out. Consider a few of
them : Speaker Abbott, who has been going to
do something great for 15 years, and has done
nothing but stand over 6ft. high ; Lyne, Cope-
land and See, the three heavy-going failures
of N.S.VV. Protectionist party; the unspeak-
able boomer, Gillies ; the commonplace
Downer, who never did anything but exist in
a large Tory orthodox way ; and the rest.
Anyhow, this paper, in its own self-satisfied
fashion, is content with its selections, and is
prepared to defend them against all-comers.
They are not an ideal 40, but Federal candi-
dates are not made in heaven, and it is neces-
sary to be content with the most likely speci-
mens to be found on this earth.
To the Ghost of the Dead Australian.
In four of the Australias the Federal Convention
election takes place this week, and, by present
signs, a very moderate vote may be expected.
The question at issue is so largo, and toe area
of the five provinces-interested is so vast, and
the individual voter looks such a very small
speck in the centre thereof, that there is a
more than usually strong tendency on every-
body’s part to remark that one vote doesn’t
matter either way, and that one fellow needn’t
trouble himself. And the fact which The Bul-
letin desires to lay down just here with a thud
like that of a falling Alp is that every individual
vote does matter. Also, that everything else
matters more or less. Some profound thinker
and dreamer, whose name the present writer has
somehow lost hold of, remarked truly that one
man cannot shift one grain of sand without
altering the world’s centre of gravity, and
through it the centre of gravity of the whole
universe, and by so doing he brings new in-
fluences to bear on the unborn generations, and
turns them into new paths, and in all the
billions of ages yet to come the Cosmos will
never be quite the same as it would have been
if that grain of sand hadn’t been shifted.
Everything is related in some way to every other
thing, and nothing that is would be exactly
wdiat it is if anything that was had been just a
shade different from what it really amounted to.
EvenFRANKI arnell wouldn’t havemade exact-
ly the exhibition of himself that he recently did in
England if Mithridates had downed Pompey
instead of Pompey getting on top. The Zealots
had to go under at the siege of Jerusalem over
1800 years ago, and Cleopatra had to be de-
feated at Actium, and all the battles and wars
and plagues and famines and murders and other
events that ever took place from the times
long before early Sodom down to the other day,
when 1 urner decided to go to England and
grovel—all these things had to happen to cause
John Norton to be fined £5O in Sydney last
week for contempt of court. If only one of
them hadn’t happened, he might have been
fined £75, or riot been fined at all, or he might
have never existed, or he might have been a
Czar or a cannibal instead of a Sydney jour-
nalist. And the point which all this leads up
to is that if any individual voter doesn’t vote
at the Federal election the world will never be
quite the same again as it would be if he did.
The man who doesn’t vote is missing a chance
to get his little lever under the universe and
start it in a new' direction. He is throwing
away an opportunity to make history ; his
suffrage, or the absence of it, will start some
impalpable change, which will widen and spread
till it capsizes empires or keeps them from
capsizing, till it causes or averts wars and con-
vulsions and the making of new states and the
upheaval of old ones, and shifts futurity in
general from its basis. The man who gets to
the poll too late can stop outside and look at
the closed door, and consider within himself
that his descendants and other people’s de-
scendants down to the remotest generation will
never quite get aw r ay from the effects of that one
insignificant episode. Even if one obscure per-
son named Smith is too tired to take any
interest in the matter, he will thereby make
the beginning of a small stream of circumstance
which will never stop flowing, and which will
gradually widen out until it turns the destiny
of Australia and the world into new channels,
and bursts up things that might have been, and
makes all manner of new things which would
never otherwise have occurred. And when the
reincarnated ghost of Smith returns to this
earth thousands of years hence to live over
again, as it possibly may, it will be quite a
different world from w r hat it would have been
if he had acted differently on this occasion—
possibly a worse one, possibly a better one, but
a different one anyhow. No one can tell in
advance whether the change which will be
effected by one individual citizen adding his
ballot to the heap will be for better or worse,
but it will be a change anyhow ; it will help to
prevent the universe getting mouldy, and the
solar system from stagnating, and" the fixed
stars from growing fossilised, and it will prod
the Cosmos into some new sphere of activity.
Therefore, it is incumbent on every Australian
citizen to vote, and in 60,000 years, or some
other period, his astral being, if it is around,
may be able to trace the consequences and know
that it at least tried to keep things moving
while it was in the flesh, and didn’t lean on a
gate quite all its life with an unseeing eye fixed
on a passing dog.

Going West.
Last year, according to the estimates of the
local statistician, the population of Victoria
decreased by nearly 7000. The population of
N.S. W. for the same year showed an estimated
increase of 19,000, which is much below the
usual average. There is a slight discrepancy
in the modes of computation, it being the custom
in Victoria to add 10 per cent, for possible
departures not recorded, but the figures are
near enough for all practical purposes. Accord-
ing to the actual records, the cause of the
trouble was that 14,000 more people left Vic-
toria and 800 more left N.S. Wales than arrived
in these provinces, and the bulk of them were
bound westward to the alleged Land of Gold
about Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. This persis-
tent “ trek” towards the sunset is only another
evidence of how distant fields keep on looking
green because of their distance, long after all
reasonable excuse for their greenness has de-
parted. The gold-yield of Westralia is growing
smaller in proportion to population instead of
larger, consequently the prospects of the indi-
vidual miner are becoming steadily less. The
gold now. obtained comes mostly from half-a-
dozen big mines owned by companies ; the pro-
portion which remains for the individual
fossicker is miserably small. A year or
two ago he could make money - not by
digging, but by selling any reasonably pro-
mising show to the credulous J. Bull, but
now J. Bull is sick and full-up and disgusted,
and a mine is almost as difficult to float as a
ton of loose bricks on the sea. The prospects
of employment on the companies’ mines grow
worse rather than better, for many of them are
abandoned,and many more are underexemption,
and many that were going to start never got
started at all ; also, the shadow of Italian
bond-labor is coming o’er the land. The
demand for labor on public works has di-
minished greatly ; most of the large ones
recently on hand are completed, and there
are no prospects of more being undertaken
on a large scale till the new loan floats,
and it seems to be indefinitely postponed. The
Coolgardie Miner thus describes the situa-
tion :
We can point to nothing but distress and disaster should
the population continue to increase at the present rapid
rate. The prevailing slump has led to the suspension of
work, and in many instances the total abandonment of
promising prospecting shows held by local owners, while
the tremendous number of exemptions which have been
granted all over the country have had the effect of throw-
ingl some thousands of men upon the labor market. The
field, therefore, now offers no inducement to those about
to leave their homes for' this colony, unless idleness and
starvation can be accounted such. Actual distress is
already becoming prevalent in the outer centres, and the
day of unemployed demonstrations is not far distant.
Here in Coolgardie are hundreds of men seeking work and
finding none, and what to do with these vast idle throngs
will soon be a problem for the authorities, who in their
solicitude for capital have brought about such evils and
are still engaged in aggravating them day by day.
. . . But be this as it may, the fact remains that
we are face to face with a serious crisis, that the question
of how to feed an idle populace already looms large and
dark upon an horizon rendered closer to our senses by the
signs of approaching catastrophe, and that the Ministry
in its folly seems determined to make worse and worse,
day after day, the evil straits in which we are placed by
their lack of wisdom. In these circumstances we are per-
forming a simple duty in endeavoring to palliate the tribu-
lation we cannot eradicate by warning others against com-
ing here to share the gloomy fate which awaits our own
working men.
Almost all the private communications which
come from the West tell the same tale, but
nothing seems to check the exodus, and it will
probably continue till it is swamped by the
backward movement, which must set in shortly
from the busted Land of Promise. And mean-
while, before the rush to the dead-broke El
Dorado of the West has begun to decline, a
new one has started Northward to fever-
haunted, trackless New Guinea, where the
gold found up to date hasn’t paid expenses,
and which is almost more unpromising even, so
far as is known at present, than Westralia.
Every orator and every Dan O’Connor in the
three Eastern provinces has talked for years
about their “boundless resources” and “illimit-
able natural wealth,” but somehow they seem
unable to support in comfort an average popu-
lation of one male adult to 640 acres, and the
desire to get anywhere and anyhow out of
“ this great country ” is a wonderfully unani-
mous sentiment.
The Little Nigger.
There is plenty of law, but no great superfluity
of justice for the little nigger in Westralia.
Recently in Roebourne district, in the Far
North, where the chances of the small nigger
are even worse than they are in some other
parts of the province, a diminutive aboriginal
aged 14, and bearing the name of Friday, was
charged with being “ unlawfully on the pre-
mises ” during the night. The only person
who saw the individual who was said to have
been on the premises was a very young girl,
and her evidence was simply to the effect that
she couldn’t recognise Friday, and didn’t know
whether he was the person or not. A tracker
swore that he identified Friday’s footprints
about the premises, but being questioned he
said that all the tracks went “ straight fellow,”
and as Friday had a badly-distorted foot he
didn’t fit the description. Therefore the evi-
dence really amounted to this : that some
tracks had been discovered, not at all like
those of the prisoner, and that a girl didn’t
know whether he was the offender or not.
However, the scared Friday was inserted in the
dock, with no lawyer to defend him and no
witness, and was tried in a strange language,
and, in his ignorance and anxiety to propitiate
the court, he answered “ Yes ” to every ques-
tion put to him. All through the case he said
nothing but “Yes.” When asked if he was
guilty he said “ Yes ; ” if he had been asked
if he was innocent he would have said “ Yes ”
also. When he had said “Yes” a sufficient
number of times he was convicted on his own
confession, and Magistrate Brockman sentenced
him to 12 months’ gaol and 12 lashes. All the
questions put to the miserable little nigger
were heaved at him in the technical lan-
guage of the court; he was asked if he
wanted to “ cross-examine ” the huge police-
man, and if he desired to summon witnesses,
and it was taken for granted that boy Friday
understood all these matters, merely because he
said “ Yes ” all the time. A local paper,
Northern Public Opinion, thereafter came
out with a severe article on boy Friday, the
bloodthirsty editor regretting that he didn’t
get a larger flogging, and pointing out the
necessity of putting down such desperadoes
with a strong hand. The only individual who
attempted to interfere on Friday’s behalf was
his employer, who desired to act as his counsel,
but was snuffed out with an intimation that he
couldn’t appear unless Friday called him as a
witness. Friday didn’t call him, probably
because he didn’t know how, and that de-
molished his last chance. For that matter,
however, boy Friday never has any chance,
last or otherwise, with the hog-like administra-
tors of W.A. justice.

Doomed!
When the supernatural explanation of things
was the only explanation, the priest—pre-
dominant and arrogant—was the great fact of
human society. But ever since the prostrate
mind of man began to struggle to its knees, and
in proportion as for phenomenon after pheno-
menon there has been discovered a simple and
inevitable natural causation, sacerdotalism has
been steadily forced backwards towards extinc-
tion. The process is slow, but the end is cer-
tain. When the natural explanation of things
in general shall have entirely superseded the
supernatural, the priest will have to go, because
there will then be no place for him in the order
of things. Humanity will have no use for an
expounder of gratuitous assumptions about
what cannot possibly be known. To this goal,
it is true, we have yet far to travel. The mind
of man aforesaid is far enough yet from a per-
fectly erect position ; but, amongst the proofs
that it is slowly attaining that desirable atti-
tude, it is to be noted that not a single
priestly voice has been raised to proclaim that
the existing bubonic plague has been “ sent ”as
a physical punishment for the moral offences of
the afflicted peoples. This is wisdom, of a
sort ; for, though the ultimate decease of sacer-
dotalism is but a matter of time, nothing kills
so quickly as ridicule, and, in the light of
modern physiological research, the ancient
“ visitation ” gag would be to every man who
does his own thinking simply a subject for con-
temptuous laughter.
M illiam Fuller was fined 16s. 3d. and costs
at a i Red fern (Sydney) police-court, one day last
week, for neglecting to pay the State-school
fees levied on his children. In default of pay-
ing fees and costs he was to be sold up, and in
the event of enough not being raised that way
YV illiam was to be sent to gaol. The prosecu-
tion was directed by Minister Garrard. It is
unnecessary to work in agony about Fuller’s
poverty, or the why or wdiereforeof his neglect
to cash upthreepennies as the law directs. The
prosecution is a valuable incident solely because
it rubs into the public intelligence the fact that
after years of agitation and irrefragable argu-
ment N.S. VV. still stands as a doltish anomaly
which with one breath makes primary educa-
tion compulsory and with the next makes pay-
ment for that education compulsory and
collectable under penalties of fine and
imprisonment. Those acquainted with the
political movements of the last ten years
can recall numerous occasions when strong
majorities in Parliament favored free education,
and when even the opposing Parkes faction
admitted that it had no logical ground to stand
upon, but on every test occasion occult in-
fluences were brought to bear, and the three-
penny aggravation still stuck to the statute
book. In its last session N.S.W. Parliament
was similarly minded to destroy the impost,
and destroyed it would have been had the
Labor members risen to the expectations formed
of them. In the hurried days at the close of
the session, when a Minister of the Crown was
threatened with a demand for bills for the
imposition of newspaper postage and for free
education, that political duke, fearing the
wrath of the press, replied that the parties
at the back of these bills had, by claim-
ing that their own official letters should go
franked, lost their moral influence on the
questions named. So always, by one strata-
gem or another, the public will is burked.

Kish the buke ” has just been abolished by
announcement from the bench in Leeds, Eng.,
police-court, and the present Scotch oath with
uplifted right hand substituted—“l swear by
Almighty God that I will speak the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth.” The
only real value of the oath is as an impressive
hypnotic dose ; in fact, the notion is to frighten
the average witness into getting as near the
truth as possible. The old Scotch oath was a
magnificent ceremony and tremendously im-
pressive. The sheriff would rise up in gor-
geous trappings of office, raise his right hand
heavenwards, and sonorously announce clause
by clause, the witness, with right hand raised,
following him—
I swear by Almighty God,
As I shall answer to God,
At the great Day of Judgment,
That I will tell the truth,
The whole truth.
And nothing but the truth.
Just imagine the effect of that so delivered by
George Joseph of Canaan Rignold, in trap-
pings like a Cardinal’s, on the average witness 1
It would make even a bronze lion wriggle.

“ One of the undoubted results of Federation,”
writes “ Lex,” “ will be the establishment of a
Federal Court of Appeal. This will be a new
charge on the Federal provinces, and the ques-
tion arises how it can be efficiently and economi-
cally arranged. At least three, but more likely
five, Judges will be needed, and, if special ap-
pointments are made, and the best available
talent secured, a salary of not less than .£3OOO
will have to be paid. But appeals are not
.numerous, and are not likely to much increase
in number for years, so the Appeal Judges
would be idle three-fourths of the year. Why
not appoint the Chief-Justices of the federating
provinces—six eventually—without increase of
salary? A Chief-Justice does not arrive there
without possessing extensive legal knowledge,
and his impartiality is seldom questioned. The
work could easily be overtaken by a ten-days’
sitting once a quarter, and the Judges could sit
in batches of three—thus giving to each an at-
tendance of, say, 26 days, allowing for journeys.
Besides the saving of from <£lo,ooo to £20,000
a year, the Chief-Justices themselves would
largely benefit by rubbing up against each
other.”
A passage in Justice Hood’s summing-up of
the gruesome Rosebrook murder-case went
without comment by the Melb. press, although
it was the most extraordinary feature of a
phenomenal trial. All that the public ever
knew of the Rosebrook horror, as a horror, was
communicated by detectives to newspaper
reporters, who promptly put it into print. In
this way the statement of Mrs. Snell, the self-
alleged accessory to her father’s crime, and all
the facts tending to substantiate that statement
came to be published. The Lyfield shown by
the police was a dull, methodical monster of
iniquity, and as such it was expected that he
would have to stand his trial. The Lyfield
shown in the criminal court was merely a
suspected murderer and possibly model
parent, against whom nothing was proved
except that he talked like a person suffer-
ing from delusions. Some medical witnesses
gave Mrs. Snell a certificate of insanity
which put her out of court and thereby
cancelled, in a judicial sense, all the “orful
revelations ” that had been laid to the prisoner’s
charge. The trial of Lyfield produced so
little real evidence against him that he must
have received the benefit of a jury’s honest
doubt had not the 12 men in the box formed
their conclusions on the case from the police
stories they had read, or heard of, and which
their common sense told them to believe. But
Justice Hood told them—“ I want to express
publicly my regret, not that the newspapers
publish these things, but that the officials of
the Crown Law and Police Departments permit
the detectives to go straight to the newspaper-
reporter directly they have discovered any-
thing good.” His Honor chose an appropriate
time for expressing this regret. In ordinary
cases police prattling may lead to injustice. In
this case it was, on paper, solely responsible
for a murderer being classed under his proper
heading and sent to gaol for an indefinite
period. Lyfield’s trial, per se, left him quite
open to an acquittal.

Tlxe above burst of verse explains, in part
At least, how The Bulletin feels concerning
“ Matsa,” which is now running at Her Majesty’s,
Sydney. There is less attempt at a story in this
Egyptian spectacle than even the usual panto-
mime can boast of, which is probably a good thing.
Too much story only encumbers a pantomime,
and is as superfluous as a top-hat on a mummy.
As a series of pictures and dances and a mass of
whirl and color “ Matsa ” can hold its own against
everybody and everything. Also, it can race any
other spectacle on record in the matter of mechani-
cal effect, the Rising of, the Nile being an item
that could give Bilmartin ten yards start
any day and beat him badly in the first lap.
There are some clever performers in the cast,
notably Little Gulliver, who is a wonderfully
bright and original infant, or dwarf, or a mixture
of both ; also Lauri, Howard Vernon, and Misses
Florence Young, Juliet Wray, and May Pollard.
As for beauty and youth and legs and music, they
are present in abundance ; and the presence of
Knowles telling over again in a hjirry all the old
jokes he formerly told in a hurry at the Palace
also counts for something. But “Matsa” is essen-
tially spectacle, and it fills its mission as such in a
great, lavish, generous way that appeals to the
soul. If it doesn’t boom with a great boom, then
the spectacular business is played out.

On Saturday the Westmacott management
At Sydney Royal judiciously 4 threw the “Mother’s
Sin ” into the place where the dead mothers go,
and put up “Shall We Forgive Her?” in its
stead. The Bulletin’s impression, after con-
sidering this production in all its five acts, is that
she might as well be forgiven, but that the person
who forgave her in the drama is beyond forgive-
ness. The new play is a combination of many old
episodes. The heroine has a past and a sin—the
same old sin ; the stage heroine never has any
other. She had been a I’anqueray in a hut in
South Africa, where she Tanked with a scowling
ruffian as her paramour, and lived on bread and
dust; there was no water, for the drought was
very bad. Then, being moved by a kind curate,
she gives up Tanking, and goes to England and
reforms, and beeomes the wife of a noble-hearted
man, and almost forgets that she ever Tanked out
on the Karroo. Naturally her sin is found out
after a time, and her husband throws her out.
He becomes blind, like Pygmalion, and is led
about by a sour female relative of aggravated
Christianity, who acts as his dog, and ought to
bark to keep up the illusion. For two acts his
ejected Magdalen keeps calling round in a state
of despair, and trying to explain how circum-
stances drove her to Tank in Africa. She never
gets through her explanation, however, for the
sour female relative, Joanna, always shoo’s her
off the premises before she is half-finished. The
Christian virulence of Joanna, and the way she
always hunts the repentant wife off the grass
just when she is getting to the interesting part
of her story, are deeply objectionable. Even the
curate is moved to profane language, and the good
old motherly woman of the play calls for tenders
for the murder of Joanna and the secret removal
of her body. Then things end suddenly, for the
husband gets back his eyesight, and forgives
his Magdalen publicly in the garden, while she
kneels on the damp grass in the presence of all
his relatives. The present writer regards the hus-
band as a pious and moral hog. Any decent in-
dividual would have forgiven his wife unobtru-
sively in the house, or round in the back yard, or,
if he must forgive her publicly in the front garden,
would have sent away the crowd first of all and
offered the lady a chair.
* * * *
With all its old conventionality the clum-
sily-named drama has a good deal of human
interest about it. The lady who went astray, and
who is ultimately forgiven in that large fashion in
the garden is nicely, if not very strongly, played
by Miss Fitzmaurice Gill, and Miss Conroy, as
Joanna, is an artistically sour Christian made up
mostly of vinegar and moral front teeth. Plimmer
is a fine, manly curate ; Cecil Ward is a moderate
—a very moderate —hero ; Sweeney drifts by for a
moment as a pleasant comedy ruffian, and Hans
Phillips is a depressing failure. Stanford is
another highly picturesque ruffian, and he slinks
so ably through the drama that his disappearance
without first butchering Joanna is deeply regret-
able. A very gorgeous patch of desert scenery by
Howden, with rocks and bones and sun-glare in
it, calls for three cheers and a bit of National
Anthem all to itself.

August Juncker’s new opera, “ A Romance
of Corsica,” which is doing a trial sprint at Sydney
Opera House, leaves a distinctly favorable impres-
sion on The Bulletin’s intelligence. Whst it
really knows about the play isn’t much ; the writer
tried to take it in on Monday night when a deluge
was pouring on the roof of the hollow-sounding
old barn in King-street, and most of the opera was
drowned in the din ; also, there were no copies of
the libretto available, and under these conditions
no one is expected co know what a song is about.
But when the play did come to the surface to
breathe every now and then there was generally
something interesting on deck, and scraps of
bright and pleasant music rose here and there
above the row that the rain was making on the
roof, and where the words were audible bits of
clever rhyme asserted themselves at intervals.
The two very tall men in disguise also seemed to
know what they were doing; and the co. in
general, whenever the writer could disentangle it,
appeared to act and sing rather cleverly ; and the
prima donna, Miss Anna Petersen—if it was she
—panned out very well indeed. This scribe
intends to tackle Juncker’s opera again, on a dry
night, and find out in real earnest what it is ail
about.

Very much the same crowd as last week
is in possession of the Palace and the Tivoli. They
have possibly been shifted about a little, but it is
difficult to follow the wanderings of Rickards’ stars
from one street to another. Rickards, having
three theatres on hand, finds it necessary to go to
Europe in search of more talent, so a fresh consign-
ment of novelties will be due shortly.

Henry Bracy’s opera co. starts business at
Sydney Lyceum on Saturday with the “Beggar
Student.” The cast includes Mrs. Bracy, Miss
Nina Osborne, Bracy, Knight Aston, Rebottaro,
and others, and the list of operas to be produced
covers several good old pieces that have been buried
so long that they should now be almost as new as
the newest. If the co. only swears off “Mari-
tana,” which is a hackneyed evil that almost all
opera companies fall into sooner or later, it should
do well.

The Lumiere Cinematographe leaves Syd-
ney this week, but as MacMahon’s show and the
Edison Electric Parlor remain indefinitely, the
city has probably still as much cinematographe as
it can assimilate. The last-named, which hangs
put at 162 Pitt-street, is a comprehensive show,
including cinematographe, phonograph, kineto-
phone, kinetoscope, x-ray apparatus, and a whole
lot of other mysteries.

“A Woman’s Reason,” now at Melbourne
Bijou, received a certificate of merit from The
Bulletin a few weeks ago, when the unreasonable
heroine was going astray at Sydney Cri. It is a
sound, sermonic sort of comedy-drama in three
acts, and its principal moral purpose is to warn
the dashing militaire against eloping with married
ladies under doubtful circumstances. In this case
a tame captain waits seven years for his chance to
annex the female property of an estimable Jew
speculator, the lady being an unsettled, un-
mother ly person who objects to the practical vir-
tues of her sister-in-law, Leah. Her noble parents
sold her to Leah’s brother in the first act, and for
seven years afterwards they live upon that patient
Hebrew like a plague of locusts, devouring his
colossal income, and belittling his respectable char-
acter, and calling attention to the fact that
his grandmother sold oranges. All this while
the) lady doesn’t trouble to think whether she has
acquired connubial happiness or otherwise, but as
soon as the front-door bangs behind her hasty
elopement she discovers a wild yearning for her
husband, and loathes, positively loathes, the cap-
tain 19 times more than he deserves. Conse-
quently, the patient lothario gets left like his law-
ful predecessor, and the lady bemoans her sin in a
cottage until the husband (divorced) returns to
her arms. Then the narrative dies away into
silence, leaving a tearful audience to suppose that
the happy pair will get their decree nisi overruled
by the Privy Council.
* * • *
A greasy vicar, played by Carey, provides
some irreverently comic relief to this serious enter-
tainment. The shepherd ambles in and out of the
story, attended, as a rule, by a sporting daughter,
who makes a soulful book on the principal handi-
caps, and gives a tithe of her winnings to the
curate’s sustentation-fund every time she “ skins
the lamb.” In the last act, he visits the penitent
heroine on his own, and exhorts her not to con-
taminate any needy sheep by supplying them
with coats and blankets. Brough, as the noble
locust-father, is a companion picture to Rev. Carey.
Either man might have been the other. They are
both the same humbug, bred and educated
under different conditions, and each is a con-
siderable artistic success in his way. Tithe-
radge and Mrs. Brough uphold the unthankful
characters of the married couple, but Ferris, the
colorless captain, intones his lines as though he
held a commission under Gen’ral Booth. Miss
Seymour, in the sister Leah capacity, fires off one
or two speeches with honest enthusiasm, and the
other people make useful contributions towards
the support of a promising show. “ A Woman’s
Reason ” should draw the women, and satisfy the
men who have to pay for seats. The construction
is rather clumsy, also some of the effects are
theatrical rather than dramatic, but the authors
have worked a lot of human interest into their
tale.

“The Prisoner of Zenda” will run till
March 12th at Melbourne Princess’s, and the tail
end of its career promises to wag brilliantly. A
play steeped in self-sacrificial sentiment and fervid
devotion to His Majesty the King needs a little
time to grow upon the average Australian man,
but his average girl is a shrill barracker for
“ loyalty ” and blighted affection. Although not
personally unselfish (Marcus Clarke took the Aus-
tralian girl’s measure, years ago) she likes to think
herself in sympathy with stage characters who are
that way disposed. Therefore the popularity
of Princess Flavia and Rudolph Rassendyll
increases; also the villain Michael is adored by
stealth, so to speak, on account of his bold, black
eyes with rings of paint round them. A dark pirati-
cal glance across the footlights is probably the next
best thing to a noble character. Michael’s clothes
are a!ways satisfactory, anyhow, whereas Rassen-
dyll, for no conceivable reason, makes his first ap-
pearance—as a British johnnie—in a truly shocking
costume. The recollection of his reddish-brown
pants and brownish-red vest (to match his hair)
lingers through the next three acts, tarnishing the
gilt of his military buttons, and raising the ques-
tion whether Flavia would have loved the heroic
impostor if she had ever seen him in the
original sac suit. One very probable reason
why Flavia didn’t take kindly to the real king
was His Majesty’s tunic, which was identical in
color with the other fellow’s waistcoat. The
tunic, by the way, tends to damage the story in its
“ loyalty ” aspect. King Rudolph excites no
admiration. A drunken, squeaky young ass at
the outset, he crops up again at the finish as the
demented occupant of the same hideous tunic, and
it is hard for any beastly Democrat to understand
why all the good people in the play should put
themseles so much about to restore such an un-
lovely article to the throne of his auburn ancestors.
He is responsible for a sad waste of National
Anthem.

Bland Holt’s massive show at the Royal
has lost none of its massiveness since last week,
neither does the glory of Miss Watson’s “ damn ”
diminish. Miss Watson’s hearty performance is
much admired, even apart from her famous impre-
cation, and the ladies altogether are voted dream-
like as regards their dresses. In fact, “ The
Derby Winner” might lean against its drapery
display if there were not a dozen other and larger
considerations to rely upon for support.

At Melbourne Opera House a strong bill
was made several degrees stronger on Saturday by
Wilton and Stack, the two graceful gymnasts,
who are understood to lick creation on the hori-
zontal bars.
A bit of ancient story, full of glare and gas and
glory, ’neath the shadow of the pyramids
beside the dreamy Nile,
Where the sun sets red and golden, gilding many
a palace olden in Memphis, where the shores
are haunted by the crocodile ;
There old mummies resurrected by spells quite un-
expected, stream through marble halls, adorned
with barbaric gold and gem,
As the centuries roll back on their endless, dusty
track, and once again the sun is new o’er the
old, old land of Khem,
While “ Matsa ” weaves a spell in a gaudy, garish
hell, and scatters incantations and mysteries
in Khem.
Very small and trim and neat are the myriad
little feet which dance in bygone Memphis,
by the Pharaohs’ golden throne ;
A 1 as ! the feet are dust, and the jewelled gear is
rust, and the dancers sleep in Sais or Pelusium
or On.
But the ages going back take with them on their
track, like an atom that is carried on a
cyclone’s outer hem,
A weird Australian man in a suit of grey and tan,
who sells shares to Pharaoh Rameses in the
early days of Khem,
And, though we aren’t told, Pharaoh probably was
sold, and had to file his schedule by the
dreamy Nile in Khem.
There are gnomes and ghosts in plenty, and houris
ten times twenty, and palaces and odalisques
and harems in galore ;
And the desert land extending, like a tale that’s
never ending, with pyramids and sphinxes and
gods is littered o’er ;
And the waving, sun-kissed curls of the bright
Egyptian girls, like flowers that dance and
quiver on the sacred lotus stem,
Make a foreground to the trees, and shed fragrance
on the breeze, and make Osiris young again in
the musty land of Khem.
And the mummies that were hid in the dusty
pyramid wake to live and love and dance again
with the merry maids of Khem.
At eve the lotus closes, and the lilies and the roses
and the palm that droops its heavy leaves
upon the scented air,
Are reflected in the river where the ripples pass
and quiver, and the moon looks down upon
them with a silent, pallid stare ;
And as he writes these lines the writer half in-
clines to leave off modern politics and dreary
things like them
And wander gently back on the long-forgotten
track of the centuries, and run a paper by the
Nile, in Khem ;
To bring out his little journal among the shades
eternal, and get an “ad.” from Moses in the
ancient days of Khem.
At Poverty Point .
Variety biz booms in Westralia. All the chief shows are
conducted in the open air during summer, indoor per-
formances being given to paper and empty cane-bottomed
chairs. George Jones and G. R. Lawrence run the
show in Perth on a large, sandy plot of ground in the
main street, which is nightly witnessed by crowded
audiences. The Lumiere Cinemat. is now the draw- and
backed up by a fairly good co., is bringing in shekels fast!
The Banvards and the muscular Lucifer are now due at
“Ye Olde English Fayre,” by which name the show is
know'n.
• I ;l tz f" r^ ds ; C l rc T’ when last heard from, was showing
in Perth, W.A., to bumper houses.
Hayes, the well-known circus-proprietor, died ot
pleurisy at Fremantle hospital, W.A., on 11th Feb aired
54. Hayes, who made and lost several fortunes during
his life, died very poor, but was given decent burial in
Perth by the Fitzgeralds and other friends, Gentile and
Hebrew.
A curious theatrical case was lately heard in
Perth. A lady, when under engagement to’King Hedlev
to sing at Cremorne Gardens, became noticeably in an
interesting condition, which so shocked the frequenters
of the Gardens that K.H., “yielding to numerous
requests,” terminated the agreemeht. A claim was made
for £55 for wages and the price of a boat-fare back to the
East, and a verdict was given for plaintiff. The plea for
the defence—that the condition of the performer justified
breach of contract—was not listened to by the Bench
Two well-known journalists gave evidence as to the cus-
tom of allowing performers to appear in that condition
and Regina Nagel unblushingly admitted that it was
quite the thing in the profession, but expressed the
opinion that it was “positively disgraceful,”
Ada Crossley speaks of the “ iciness ” of London morn-
ing-concert audiences. She is much pleased with her
success in “ Elijah,” and gratified with the appreciation
of the critics, who have a playful way of jumping on
every oratorio debutante in the Oity of Cliques. Although
the “sacred chamber in her soul” has not yet been
opened, yet I hear (writes a correspondent to Tub Bulle-
tin) that one or two knocks—not of the “ runaway ” type
—have echoed sympathetically in that hitherto cold,
irresponsive breast. This may sound poetical, hut the
plain prose is that if Ada attains full womanhood she will
sing as she should sing, and as she doesn't now, and
net treble the sized fees at present offered her.
Mrs. Fenwick has made her appearance in the law-courts
in quest of her stage earnings—and an advt,., writes Tim
Bulletin's London correspondent. When Sylvia Grey,
the Gaiety girl, married Mr. Fenwick, of Sydney, and his
gilded ornaments, the two-made-one occupied a fine es-
tablishment at Melton Mowbray, the pride-swollen, swell
centre of Hinglish ’unting. It is easier for a double-
humped, water-inflated camel to pass through the eye of a
just-born toy-terrier pup than it is for an actress, and a
g.g. at that, to enter the olique-y kingdom of the 'orty
'enters. No stone wall with a spiney cactus topping
could prove a more un-get-over-able obstacle than the
sleety, glacial opposition offered to the graceful gyrator’s
attempts to enter into that inner heaven of the nastiest
Nicest People, and the Fenwicks failed. Sylvia salved her
wounded pride in the warmth of the hazy footlights, and
her injured pocket with a favorable verdict against a non-
parting manager.
X. : Oscar Wilde’s name on Melb. Bijou streamers is
occasionally embarrassing. 'Tother day, the innocent
maiden of the theatre-party asked “hadn’t the author
done something dreadful? And, please, what was it?”
Every man present blushed ; the other girls laughed im-
moderately'.
Lemmone, The Bulletin hears, has determined to go
into the musical business in Australia as agent for various
instruments and Daniel Mayer's patent Resonator.
Mayer is the Jewish musical agent to whom Melba,
Crossley and others entrust their business.
Director Harrison, of the Patti concerts, has arranged
for a series of 20 concerts to be given in Liverpool, Man-
chester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, &c., during Oct. and Nov.
with Melba as soprano, Ada Crossley as contralto, and
Ben. Davies as tenor.
The portly Marie Elster, as prima donna of the Neilson
Opera Co. (writes a Bulletin correspondent), gives a re-
presentation of “ Santuzza,” which, “both dramatically
and musically, leaves nothing to be desired.” This week
she made her first appearance in London, and Australians
who heard her were simply charmed with her work. She
has lately had several good offers for America, and in the
part named can easily wipe out Del Torre.
“A Woman of No Importance,” says somebody, was
obviously suggested by' the ymunger Dumas’ “Le Fill
Naturel.” The little bit of plot might have been sug-
gested by “ Sweet Lavender,” or any other play in which
a man lights unexpectedly upon the illegitimate child of
a long-ago intrigue. Anyhow, the plot is but a very
minor consideration in Oscar Wilde’s play.
Julius Knight’s performance in “ Prisoner of Zenda ” is
said to be a faithful copy of the original, George Alexan-
der. In the matter of stage presence Knight is at some
disadvantage, however, and presence is about 99 percent,
of the battle for a hero who is mimicking a king. Herbert
Flemming, ten years ago, would have played Rassendyll
admirably, with a manner vigorous, yet debonnair, and
“the face of a god”—as a certain actress used to say.
A Bulletin correspondent enquires: “ What is the
trade secret of the scarcity of children in theatrical
domestic circles?” Well, the scarcity that he takes
for granted is merely an old public delusion which
actresses are careful not to explode. They don’t, as a
rule, wheel prams in public as proudly as mothers in
general, or walk about with children in arms, but in the
matter of maternity “professional” ladies get there all
the same, merely drawing the line (as a rule) at large
families. Mrs Kendal, Eilen Terry, and Nellie Farren
have two or three children apiece—the public only heard
of them when they grew up. Poor little Violet Varley
died practically in childbirth, within a year or so of mar-
riage. And doesn’t the average sketch of an actress’s
career begin with the statement that she comes of mum-
mer parents ?
Editor Bulletin, — Nicholas Charles Bochsa’s remains
lie in Newtown (Sydney) cemetery under an artistic stone
raised to his memory by his “grateful pupil, Anna
Bishop.” Lavenu found a grave in the same cemetery,
while Cutolo, I believe, is in St. Jude’s, Randwick, and
Packer in Rookwood.—Yours, F.
Manager Rickards always sits in his own private-box on
the first night of any of his London artists’ appearanc-es.
Tis said that because of this the performers feel ill at
ease. This was especiallv noticeable with even such an
experienced veteran as Chirgwin.

The City Mutual Life Assurance Society in
reply : “ Dear Bulletin, —That annuity-cum-fully-paid-
policy does seem anomalous. I will have it seen to.
Thanks for drawing attention to it. Not much harm has
resulted, however, as we have only issued in 18 years one
fully-paid policy and three annuities—one of which fell in
last January, three months after purchase. But we
haven’t a penny in trust at 5 per cent., and, what is more,
we are not taking any. And we have not issued even one
tontine policy with an estimate. Following the example
of one big office, we did get a few estimates printed, but
they were withdrawn a week after they were printed.
And that was some time ago. And you are right in say-
ing we are taking a good many risks, but as the doctor
first passes them we are willing to take more.—Geo.

N.S.W. revenue for February was ,£18,370
more than for Feb., ’96. Revenue for the first eight
months of the financial year (£5,880,865) is £157,322 be-
hind that for the corresponding period of last year, but
as it was £228,000 behind at the end of December the
last two months have pulled things up materially. Ex-
penditure, so far, is £6,323,478, so the deficit is already
£442,000, and there is a lot of leeway to make up if the
next surplus is to pan out all right.
* * * *
The N.S.W. local 3 per cent, loan is getting on
steadily. The amount sold in February was £31,450.
Since the beginning of the year £301,000 has been sold,
and the total amount of the loan issued since it first
opened, about four months ago, is over half-a-million.
It cost 2s. 6d. per cent, less interest than any N.S.W. loan
ever floated in London, even saying nothing about the
saving in management, remittance of interest, &c., which
amounts to a good deal more. The only drawback is that
a loan which is always going off silently at the Treasury
attracts no attention, while the one that goes off with a
howl under the tender-system helps to draw public atten-
tion to the way the debt keeps mounting up. But, as the
public never does anything when its attention is drawn,
that matters little or nothing.
* * * *
“The fact of the matter,” writes Mr. R.
Griffiths to The Bulletin re a recent paragraph, “is that
three of the old directors of the Overflow * retired ’
because a sweeping majority of shareholders desired a
change and insisted on a progressive policy in connection
with the mine being adopted. The shareholders are
anxious to see their money expended on machinery and
erection of water jacket furnace, so as to enable the
yields of auriferous matte and bullion to speak for the
mine. The old board was going too slow for them, hence
the ‘ retirement.’ Again, the shares were not sold at half
former rates, and any offered were eagerly snapped
up. As one of the much-maligned ‘ squatters,’ I am
content to leave judgment on the wisdom of our
policy to stand over for another twelve months, fully
satisfied that the mine, and results therefrom, will
vindicate us. At least, we are free from the imputa-
tion of gulling the public and inducing them to put their
money into a wild-cat venture. We have developed the
mine quietly with our own money, and are going to work
it as a legitimate investment. If it fails, we lose our
money, as we have not attempted to unload on the public.
I see iio reason why men associated with the pastoral in-
dustry cannot manage the business affairs of a mine,
when guided by the practical experi-nce of a man of Mr.
John Howell’s standing in the mining world. At anv-
rate, we are not hampered by the prejudices of exploded
theories and obsolete practices of so-called ‘ mining men.’ ”

The Vic. Railway Department proposes to close
the Lancefield-Kilmore railway. This little cross-country
line, 17J4 miles in length, runs from one sleepy little town,
that the inhabitants are too tired to leave, to another
similar town, which no possible individual wants to go to.
The earnings last year were £150; working expenses,
£lOO2 ; interest on cost, £852. The interest goes on just
the same, but abandonment means a saving of £852 in
ex’s. This is the second-worst line in Victoria. The very
worst is the Maffra-Briagolong railway, which last year
earned £3Ol, and cost £3046 in working expenses and
£2745 in interest.
♦ * *
The great practical value of the new Victorian
Companies Act is best evidenced by the balance-sheet of
the Standard Bank (Melbourne). Under the form of
balance-sheet prescribed by the Act the unspeakable in-
wardness of the Standard becomes really visible for the
first time. The half-year’s loss is £7992, against £7063,
£1513, and £4908 lost in three previous half-years. The
institution has apparently been losing more since the
interest on deposits was reduced to 2£ per cent, than it
did at the old rate. The interest payable for the half-
year is £9938, and the net takings out of which it was to
be paid were just £1946, so the Standard is really in
a position to pay its depositors only nine shillings per
cent, instead of £2 10s. The liabilities are £1,294,000,
and the “ assets” are almost the most weird and ragged
collection in Australia. They include amount lost this
half-year, £7992 ; amount lost previously, £16,394 ; debts
known to be bad and utterly irrecoverable, £347,413; debts
known to be doubtful and which may prove to
be almost wholly bad, £535,186. (These latter, under
the old Act, were simply lumped in with the “Ad-
vance.”) This makes £906,985 which is either lost
or probably lost. Of the remaining £386,990 of assets
£18,078 is “ Deferred Interest” apparently owing by the
bank ; and only £356,000 looks like real assets. Even
this isn’t wholly certain, for bank premises (£41,457) are
put in at their original boom value with no allowance for
depreciation ; but still this £356,000 looks more real than
the rest. Yet even it can’t stand much investigation. As-
suming that the £535,186 of doubtful debts are really bad
and yield no interest whatever, and that the whole of the
interest and rents are derived from the £356,000 of assets
that profess to be still sound, these yield only about
£1 17s. percent, gross per annum. As the sound advances
of any bank, even in these times, should yield 5 per cent,
gross, the evidence of the interest returns seems to be
that fully half of the Standard Bank’s small remnant of
apparently sound assets are very shaky, and out of
£1,294,000 of alleged assets only about £150,000 look
decently above suspicion. Forming a rough estimate
from its own figures, the Standard Bank has lost all its
capital, and is just now in a position to pay at the most
55., or possibly only 2s. 6d. or less in the £ to' its
depositors, but as it is paying interest out of principal
instead of out of earnings, this amount is steadily grow-
ing less. The public endorses this view by offering from
Is. to 2s. in the £ for the deposits. The great reconstruc-
tion system which allows this mass of financial dry-rot
to remain above-ground, and call itself a bank, and take
deposits, and have an office and a board and a manager,
is a truly wondrous affair.
The full extent of the collapse is perhaps shown
best of all in the “gross profits.” For the half-year
ended December, ’95, these were said to be £17,241; for
the next half they appeared as £10,962 ; for the half
ended December, ’96, they are set down as £3269. Does
the management allege that the Standard Bank is really
going to the bad at this rate ; or that the old profits were
largely bogus, made by charging interest that couldn’t
be recovered on advances which were known to be lost,
and treating it as interest actually received ?
» • * *
The Australian Deposit and Mortgage Bank is
feeling rather better. In 1895 this boom institution
obtained a re-arrangement whereby three-tenths of its
deposits bore no interest at all and seven-tenths carried
only 3J per cent. It thus saved £lB,OOO a year in interest.
The last half-year before the re-arrangement the loss was
£7566, while for the half-year ended Dec., 1896, the profit
is £978. With £9OOO saved in the half-year the profit, cn
the 1895 basis, should be about £1450, so things have not
become much worse than they were 18 months ago, and
they are decidedly better than they were six months ago.
Last half the net profits were fourpence per cent, per
annum on capital; this one they are 4s. 6d. per cent.,
and that is something for a boom land bank these times.
Deposits have been reduced by £83,000 during the year.
The prospects of the shareholders are not much at pre-
sent, but something should be left for them after the
creditors have got 20s. in the £. Deposits have buyers at
125., so the market estimates the A.D. and M. Bank as
from six to twelve times as solvent as the smellful Stan-
dard.

The Land Mortgage Bank of Victoria announces
that it has got through the half-year with a loss of
£10,494, against £9696, £8847, and £6616 lost in the pre-
vious three half-years. The trouble with the Land Mort-
gage spectre is that the entire takings are only £12,024,
while interest payable on debentures alone is over
£20,000. The institution owes £900,000 on debentures at
4J per cent., and it can only afford to pay 2 per cent.,
but so far its bowelless creditors have refused to grant any
relief. There are hopes, however, of a reduction to 3£
per cent., which won’t anything like fill the deficit. The
L.M. Bank purports to have £1,032,000 lent on mortgage,
but, as this sum only yields about 2£ per cent, interest,
the actual value of the lot is probably more like £400,000,
or less. It is admitted that the loans are put in at
their old boom value, and a million in boom paper values
may mean anything nowadays from £200,000 upwards.
An attempt is being made to call up £250,000 more capital,
but so far the shareholders have only responded with
£38,000. Evidently the Land Mortgage can’t raise enough
money in calls to pay off its debenture-holders, and it
can’t get the debenture-holders to reduce interest suf-
ficiently to cover the regular half-yearly shortage, and the
reduction which its hardened creditors are thinking of
making is of practically no use at all. Under all these
conditions, it would be interesting to know what the
bank proposes to do about itself. It is a matter of reason-
able certainty that its capital is all gone in depreciation
long ago, and it looks like a concern which might pay 10s.
or so, in the £ at present values on its liabilities to the
public.

The West Australian Bank is having a good
time in the boom season. Whether the directors, being
unaccustomed to booms in the hitherto sober land of
Westralia, will know enough to take their bank in out of
the wet when the tension comes, remains to be seen. The
half-year’s profits are £16,703 compared with £12,284 last
half, and £10,972 and £10,315 for the two previous ones.
A year further back the profits used to average about
£BOOO. The W.A. Bank pays a dividend of 17£ per cent.,
and out of its accumulated profit balance it adds £25,000
to reserve. Also, it has sold £20,000 worth of new shares
for £45,000, the premium of £25,000 also going to reserve,
which now stands at £150,000. In the half-year, note
circulation has gone up from £95,000 to £156,000, and
deposits have decreased about £150,000. The W.A. Bank
has £945,000 in cash —equal to 48 per cent, of its total
liabilities. It has next to no interest-bearing deposits :
in the happy land of Westralia everybody leaves his
money with the bank gratis, and the bank keeps half of
it in the cellar and earns stupendous dividends by lending
out the other half. The institution earns 33 per cent, on
its capital, while in the East the banker grinds out his
soul wondering how to show a profit of 5 per cent, or
even less. It is opening new branches in all directions,
and growing daily larger, and its accounts seem to be
never audited ; in its own joyous Westralian way it trusts
to its regular officials, and publishes no auditors’ certi-
ficate whatever. And, judging by experiences in the East
with Ananias the auditor, it is quite as well without his
certificate.
* * * *
The United Australian Mutual Fire Insurance
Co. explains that the year’s profit is £2064, and a 6 per
cent, dividend absorbs £lBB4 of this. The balance, £lBO,
added to £2236 previously on hand, leaves, as the total
accumulation of 17 years, a sum of £2416. The U.A. Co.
has no reserve-fund, a capital of only £31,000, and a mort-
gage of £27,000 on its office property, and it is one more
of the many small Australian fire-offices which struggle
along year after year, eking out a humble dividend with
difficulty, and getting hardly any further forward. The
other lot consists mostly of big companies which are
either stationary or are steadily losing their foothold and
going backwards, and the companies that are making any
progress worth mentioning can be counted on the fingers.
The swarm of foreign institutions in Australia is steadily
eating up or crowding out the local offices, and scarcely a
year passes now without one more of the native companies
disappearing out of the list. Unless some Government
imposes a huge absentee-tax on the foreign companies, or
shuts them out altogether, this branch of business pro-
mises before very long to be almost wholly in the hands
of British and German institutions, and when the Aus-
tralian is burnt out guttural people named Hans Schmidt
will dispute the claim in a strange tongue under instruc-
tions from some place in Bavaria nr Bohemia
* * * *
The Sydney Permanent Freehold Land and
Building Co., which has done three reconstructions (the
one now in force is to the effect that the deposits
shall bear no interest at all and shall never fall due, but
shall be repaid by instalments of Is. in the £ at any time
when the money is available), states that it is still going
down hill. The loss for 1896 was £2864, against £3941 for
1895, and nearly £16,000 for 1894. Last year the institu-
tion with the long name was working under its second
reconstruction, by which interest on its £135,000 worth
of deposits was reduced to 2£ per cent., and as it couldn’t
make a living on these terms it remains to be seen
whether it can pay expenses when it gets its deposits
gratis. Another £58,000 is written off the alleged assets.
The S.P.F.L. & B. Co. has been the luckiest concern in
Australia in the matter of reconstruction, and it shows a
paper surplus of assets over liabilities of £85,000. The
public opinion of the said paper surplus is best shown by
the fact that the co.’s deposits are selling at about 7s. in
the £.
* * * *
Another tired small relic of the good times,
the Mortgage, Guarantee and Mercantile Finance Co.
(Sydney),"states that it has lost £3Bl in the last half-year,
which is about its normal condition for a very long time
back. The little concern with the long name tried to be
a land-bank in the old roaring days, but the tide ebbed,
and left it stranded with £44,000 of more-or-less unsale-
able property, and a big mortgage and other troubles.
Now it makes calls, which never seem to come in, the last
one being 2s. 6d. per share, in the hope of clearing off the
mortgage and starting fair. The capital is about £31,000
all told, and £2500 of it is lost, and the co. hangs out un-
obtrusively in a room somewhere, and tries to pacify its
depositors, who amount to £14,691. The M. G. and M.
F. Co. is a sad example of the way twopence used to
gather itself together and start a bank in the brighter
days gone by, and how mighty little was considered
sufficient excuse for a manager, and board, and all the
other paraphernalia. ,
“ Bananal ander ” : If a big reduction of deposit-
interest is obtained, it will almost certainly pull through ;
if not, it will burst, and the whole capital be called up.
Chances are about even. Can’t advise you without know-
ing your circumstances. If things go right, when divi-
dends are resumed you will probably get 50 per cent, per
annum on your investment. If they go wrong, you lose
your money and are liable for calls. The present writer
would go in—if he had the money to risk.

At time of writing, the British depositors are
growling ominously about the proposed reconswindle of
the Q.N. Bank, and there is still no definite news about
the A.J.S. Bank re-arrangement. There is an ebb and
flow in everything. The first batch of reconstructions
came on J. Bull in one of his expansive moments, and he
agreed affably. The City of Melb. re-arrangement ar-
rived on the scene when his liver was out of order, and
there was a flat refusal and liquidation. Then the re-
arrangement of the Commercial and various others found
him feeling good, and things went through with little
difficulty. Now the Bull liver seems doubtful, and no
one knows what will happen. For that matter, the
Q.N.B. proposals are enough to upset all the liver in
creation.
• * * *
Montgomerie’s Brewery Co,, another of the for-
lorn beer-enterprises of Melbourne, goes from bad to
worse. For the half-year ended 3lst December the loss
was £3055. Last half it was £lllO ; at December, ’95, it
was £1660, so the downwardness is very conspicuous. The
balance-sheet is a weird affair. Assets include “ good-
will” £25,000 (think of the stupendous cheek which
reckons the goodwill of a business that is losing over
£4OOO a year as worth anything at all); “incidental
purchase expenses,” £1682; “expenditure on well,”
£1444 ; and amount lost £1485. As none of
these items are saleable it may be estimated
that, by its own showing, Montgomerie’s is over £29,000
to the bad. Further, the assets include £lOO9 lent with-
out security ; over £20,000 of advances at book value—
not net value; the overdraft, which is gradually in-
creasing, is now over £70,000 ; and the business looks too
small to be worth talking about, for the sales for the half-
year are set down at £4396. If this really means the
entire sales, there is something colossal in the idea of
having £140,000 paid-up capital for the purpose of selling
less than £9OOO worth of liquor per annum.

The V.D.L. Bank liquidators have got the
creditors to accept 10s. in the £, payable in half-crown
instalments. This move successfully dodges £16,000 of
the shareholders’ liability in the shape of interest due to
Govt., Parliament having agreed to forgo the claim if the
creditors of the bank did their part towards pulling the
shareholders out of the mud. Thus £16,000 of the tax-
payers’ money goes as a subsidy to a few apostles of
“ Private Enterprise,” whose ability to run a bank shines
with painful conspicuousness in the history of Raspberry
Land’s flattest failure.

Three Syrians were recently fined £lOOO in
Brisbane for defrauding the Customs by means of ficti-
tious invoices, undervaluing goods supplied. Investiga-
tion showed that the Asiatics were in the habit of cheat-
ing the Customs in nearly every port, and it transpired
also that many Sydney firms habitually supplied cus-
tomers with fictitious invoices.

The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. is the great
fact in Coastal Bananaland. It owns large plantations
on the Herbert, at Geraldton and Homebush ; possesses,
also, large mills at the Isis, and a big refinery at Bulimba
Reach, Brisbane. The co. has bought Maeknade Planta-
tion on the Herbert for £65,000, and is also making over-
tures for other properties. Queensland at present sup-
plies about half the sugar required by Australia.

mines to add to the milling capacity by one-third. On
the same plans ?

While the chairman of the B.H. Water Supply,
Ltd., was assuring shareholders that the B.H. people
were satisfied with the water, the curses on the water,
the co., and the Govt, which permits the stinking fluid to
be retailed at 6d. per 100 (meter rent extra always) were
louder and deeper than at any time previous. Indeed,
8.H., feeling a little more secure than ever it did hitherto,
has come to the conclusion that the present position is
intolerable; and opposition, municipal or private, is
pretty well assured. Meanwhile, though, the demand by
the mining co’s for concentrating purposes increases
rapidly, and the 8.H.W.5., Ltd., has that business well in
hand.

A correspondent“ I think you are wrong in
supposing that if the main (Eastern) block of the North
B.H. doesn’t get the Junction North body, the other
block (the Western) must have it. If the lode doesn’t
double back, but continues in its divergent course, and
persists, it must just about miss that Western block, and
the Sultan would have it instead. And, further, the
underlay is away from the North’s western block.
“ Proved at one point in Block 10, near the
Central boundary, that the sulphide body is 275 ft. wide.
But, then, at another it is only 35ft.”

Nundle (N.S.W.)—“ Stringer and party are
working in the vicinity where a miner got £5OOO worth of
specimens in a few days.” Where ?—when ?—who ? Pro-
bably over 40 years ago, and it is well known that, once
out of the ground, gold grows rapidly with age. Nundle
is a warm place where specimens would multiply their
weight by at least five in 40 years.

The manager of the Great Western mine, Cobar

For years the public have been reading every
two or three weeks of the 5 and 10 ton crushings from
Mt. Dromedary mine, N.S.W., generally for about the
same number of oz. A mine with an output of less than
a ton of ore a day hardly deserves so much publicity.

The “Mt. M'Donald Gold Mines Co.” regis-

though Hongkong was going to be a good place to sell
N.S.W. mines. It started in by buying at a big price a
Mt M‘Donald gold-mine, once called the Balmoral, and it
has been cursing and kicking itself ever since. The man
who took a N.S.W. mine to Hongkong now would pro-
bably never leave that |sle alive.

Bed-Log: “Showing how very careful Mel
bourne papers are not to mislead the poor miner, take an
instance from the Leader, which, in a recent special
mining supplement, recommends, amongst other specs.,
the Gembrook dykes as a field calculated to repay honest
effort As well recommend Collingwood flat for sluicing.
It is quite two years since these dyke formations at Gem-
brook were tried and found wanting—wanting in gold.
There is not one working now ; in fact, there are only
about three persons hunting gold in the district, and they
do not make tucker—that is, what a Melb. soup-kitchen
habitud would call decent feeding. There are batteries
on the field, but the sound of a stamp has not been h *ard
in the land for over a year. One of these days a deceived
digger will tramp to Melbourne and kill an editor or two,
and then perhaps there will be some attempt to verify
mining-news in newspaper-offices. I have heard scores of
miners express a homicidal yearning in the above direc-
tion.”

Mt. Charlotte reported to have really struck
gold at last. It has been trying for nearly three years.
Time, too, that the good old Maritana really found some
gold. It was a newspaper-mine, and it is impossible to
say anything worse than that.
* * * *
What next ? The Coolgardie Chamber of
Mines!—an institution composed largely of mining
boomsters, and, therefore, distinguished foritscheek—has
petitioned Premier Forrest to erect State batteries for
the treatment of ores at the chief mining centres. For-
rest is said to have expressed sympathy with the idea,
and is going to consider. He might also consider the
number of batteries already around Coolgardie having,
like the boomsters, nothing to do.
* * * *
Whispered that the current Queensland Menzies
(W.A.) crushing will not be much above 3oz. per ton. A
mysteriously managed mine.
* * * *
Much emphasis is novv put on the fact that
though the lode has been passed through at the 300 ft.
level of the Great Boulder, the South drive must go over
100 ft. before reaching good ore. The inference is also
that the lode is poor going North. At one time the
papers tried to lead the public to imagine that it was all
rich, that the gold did not run in chutes, but was one
continuous run right through this mine, and on through
several others. None the less, the G.B. has proved
itself a great mine.
• • * *
Another mine— this time the Lake View Con-
sols- has bought a new 20-head battery made by Fraser
and Chalmers, lying unused in Coolgardie. The advent
of batteries is alw-ays “ hailed with much satisfaction ” by
newspapers. The fact that they are often never erected
and sold for less money than they cost in freight alone
is of no public interest, and is, therefore, never
published except by The Bulletin, whioh occasionally
suffers from liver-congestion.

Low as are the shares of W. A. mines in London,
let any Australian holder of average stock try to sell at
the prices given in the financial papers, and he will find
out his mistake. One tried lately to quit at 50 per cent,
lower than the quoted price, and yet was not able to get
out. Nine cases in ten the prices published are no
criterion of those obtainable.

It takes a remarkably good Australian mine to
stand London management. Last Eng. mail brought the
directors’ reports and statements of accounts of four
English co.’s working mines in Westralia. All are
managed in the same office, the directors (with two ex-
ceptions) consist of the same individuals, the reports are
got up in the same style, the covers only differently
colored, by Waterlow and Sons, the fashionable printers.
The expenditure in London amounted for the four co.’s
to over £lO,OOO, and fully two-thirds of this went in
directors’ fees, halance in salaries and office exs. None of
the mines are div.-paying, and the prospect of their ever
reaching that stage is remote. Will poor—or rich —Bull
ever reflect that all the div.-paying mines of Bendigo and
Ballarat combined do not spend as much money in local
management as £10,000? The writer can picture the
weekly meeting of these directors —one meeting following
quickly on the heels of another, the chairman only chang-
ing seats, and the secretary busily engaged in delicately
handing around the fees in sovs.. The average London
guinea-pig likes to be paid on the spot in sovs. So appro-
priate in a gold-mine, dontcherknow.

Murchison Gold Fields Co. meeting in London.
Chairman : “ The ventures this co. undertook have turned
out great disappointments. Our case is by no means
singular, the field has been a disappointment. Reefs
promising well, near the surface, have pinched out alto-
gether, or have become too poor to work.” A shareholder
remarked : “ The history of the co. was unfortunately
similar to that of three-fourths of the gold-mines which
had been floated during the last boom. Shareholders
were all lured by the splendid promises of the prospec-
tuses, and, in fact, thought they would have been fools if
they had not jumped at such an easy way of obtaining a
fortune ; and had taken no notice of the articles of associa-
tion, by which they were bound. The result, generally,
had been that the promoters and directors had got the
nuts, and shareholders the husks, and that was not a
satisfactory diet.” Chairman’s reply :“ He looked upon
the whole of West Australia as more or less a swindle.
He did not believe that 5 per cent, of the companies were
any good, and, as a director of this co., he would, have
nothing more to do with W.A. properties if he could help
it.”

Prof. Krause’s first report after seeing the
General Gordon mine, W.A., has been described as
“encouraging.” It is a sick mine that won’t stand an
“ encouraging report.” To determine the extent of the
gold-bearing formation he started to open-cut the surface
near the prospecting shafts. Free gold was observed
along the outs, but it was very fine. At a greater depth
he thinks it will become coarser. When he has made
detailed surveys and examinations he will prepare a full
report “on the mining conditions of the property.” The
latest excuse for not crushing is that some of the battery
fittings have been “mis-sent.” It was going to crush
four months ago ; now whispered that it is not likely to
crush this month or next. If the G.G. is anything like
the mine it is boomed to be, Krause has been there long
enough to say so. A good mine is as plain as the nose on
a man’s face. Rumor has it that a somewhat disagreeable
surprise of a financial character awaits the G.G. share-
holders.

The aftermath of the Westralian boom in Lon-
don. A shareholder at a meeting of a W.A. mine recently
held in London : “I bought my shares in this mine
through my bankers, while I wcs in Constantinople, and
I can assure you that, generally speaking, my feelings as
to mining co. directors are such that I honestly think it
would not have been a bad thing if half of them had been
in Constantinople recently and been mistaken for Ar-
menians.”

First clean-up Waratah Gold Mines, Croydon
(Q,), yielded 1020 oz. of poor gold—under 20s. per oz.

go to England, and should spell divs.

Croydon King P.C. and the North Amalga-
mated, principally held in Sydney, struck gold at 200 ft.
vertical. As the precious metal was never found there
previously within 100 ft. of this depth, the development is
important. Some shallow ground workings previously
gave tens of oz. to the ton.
* * * *
The dullest portions of Croydon are Iguana
Hill and the Highland Mary. Both have produced many
thousands oz. gold Govt, geologist Sands damned the
former, the Govt, diamond drill the latter. It would
have paid the people to have given Mr. Sands a thousand
or tw'o to keep away from the field.

Admiral Bridge is very much averse to use-
less matrimonial engagements amongst his officers,
so the visit of the fleet to Hobart this season has
been remarkably unsatisfactory to ma’s who have
shoals of marriageable daughters. In one of the
commissions nearly all the midshipmen got en-
gaged ! This was beyond a joke, so the Admiral
said if any more such nonsense took place he would
despatch the ships to obscure quarters out of harm’s
way—for he “ wouldn’t have the boys’ schooling
interfered with.”

La Revanche may be a long time coming,
but France and Germany don’t love each other too
heartily even now. The two nations differ in
most things, and, doing so, can’t even agree on
astronomical certainties, apparently. The French
warship Amiral Parsifal and the German Falke
are lying up at Mort’s Dock re-fitting, and it is
amusing to notice that each has a different sunset-
time. Each tries to get in first with gun, bugle,
and ensign down-haul, and the loser, in a dignified
manner, performs the bedding ceremony of the
sun a few minutes later ; as if to hint that the
other shop—ship, we mean—didn’t know the rules.

-Not so long ago certain epicurean members

scarce just then. In fact, there wasn’t any dead
buck on the market, but the firm entrusted with
the order got over the difficulty by slaughtering a
North Melbourne goat for the High Court of
Parliament, and the legislators ate its haunch
with enthusiasm and red-currant jelly. They
reckoned they were getting fine old venison,
whereas the cook (presumably) knew that he was
giving them some fine old kid, which made no
difference. It will be a bad day for Victoria when
its fortunes are directed by a crowd of high-class
feeders who can swear to the difference between a
rollicking deer and a North Melbourne “ billy

From Murchison (W.A.) Times :
In prosecuting his search for the missing man, the con-
stable found it necessary to chain up some gins, who,
after being chained up for some time, gave him informa-
tion which enabled him to find the skeletons of three
men who, they said, had been speared by the natives
some time last year.
“Chaining up gins in order to make them confess,
is a not uncommon practice in the Westralian
back country ” (writes a Bulletin correspondent).
“ One case that came under my notice : Prospec-
tors were working a show some hundred miles

knew there must be water close by, but the niggers
would not show them where it was ; so they got a
gin and chained her up for 36 hours, gave. her
plenty salt food to eat, but nothing |to drink ;
finally let her go, and followed close on her heels.
She went straight away for three miles, and,
stooping down, drank from a small rock-hole.”

“No mistake,” writes a Bulletin cor-
respondent, “black-gins are ideal Socialists and
equal distributors of wealth. I lately saw one of
our country-women suckling her piccaninny on
one breast and a half-bred kangaroo-pup on the
other. At the same time, she was drawing a
stumpy, black, clay pipe and blowing the smoke
through a bamboo into the mouth of her dusty
lord and master, whose head rested in her lap.”
Verily, the heathen retaliates. A little
while ago, The Bulletin hears, a young man from
the Glebe, Sydney, was shipped off to India by
Australia’s best-known camel-merchant, as a con-
vert to Islam. We can expect a ship-load of
Buddhist and Mohammedan missionaries shortly.
They’re sadly wanted.

The defence of young Phillips, charged
with the Elizabeth-st. (Melb.) murder, seems cer-
tain to involve a violent attack on the character of
the man who’s dead. At the request of Phillips’
solicitors, the trial has been postponed, to enable
them to collect “ a great mass ” of evidence from
people who are either “ unwilling ” to speak, or are
not discoverable at present. The production of
this mass of evidence is very much needed for the
credit of the firm who worked up the prisoner’s
gaudy confession. As the matter now stands,
Phillips is practically on his trial for criminal libel,
as well as for murder.

That modern solecism, a school committee,
is fighting Queensland Educational Department
about the sister of a leper-boy, now in the
lazarette, who insists on attending the local State

Department treats the committee in the old, well-

Some time ago
Sydney Municipal
Council ukased
that calico and
other shop - keep-
ing signs should
not be allowed to
disfigure the in-
side of verandahs,
or be hung in
dangerous posi-
tions on walls, as
several accidents
and deaths had oc-
curred through
such signs falling
on passers-by. But
now the shop-
keeping fraternity
have scored over
the city fathers
by having ponder-
ously-framed gas-
lights hung over
their windows.
They are ostensi-
bly for lighting
purposes, but they
are really addi-
tional sign-boards,
being painted on
allsides. And they
are anything but
securely fixed.
When one of them
drops—well, Bum-
bledon will scratch

hard.

One Austra-
lian capital re-
joices in a female
money - lender,
whose transac-
tions sometimes
cause the Supreme
Court to enquire
after her health.
On such occasions,
she sends medical
certificates and
gets excused from
attendance be-
cause she is “in
a critical state of
health.” So it
was, months ago.
So it was, still,
last week. Yet
she hasn’t affected
the census statis-
tics in the least.
Her husband ap-
pears to do all the
work, while she
takes the legal
kicks, though ab-
sent in body. It is a neat and humorous arrange-
ment, worked out strictly according to the laws
of her “ separate estate.” Even the New Woman
will probably find a husband useful and conve-
nient in similar enterprises.

Latest Maoriland census shows that to
3685 Chinese males in that province there are only
26 yellow females. Naturally, there is a great
demand for white-girl Bible-teachers among the
Maoriland heathen. The yellow vegetable-person
never takes his spiritual consolation from a bearded
elder. The elder’s plump daughter has proved to
be far preferable as a guardian angel.
The ravages of the cormo-
rant in Northern Victoria have
led the Government to offer a
reward of 3d. for each bird. A
very large cormorant-killing in-
dustry has accordingly sprung
up in the wild regions along the
N.E. borders. The cormorant-
killer pegs in manfully for a
fortnight or a month until he
has accumulated, perhaps, 3000
birds, and then he humps them
along to the nearest Customs
officer to be counted and in-
spected, and the heads cut off
as a guarantee against fraud.
The cormorant doesn't smell
nice at any time, and 3000 of
him that have accumulated for
a in the hot weather
smell something unspeakable.
Lately the hunters have been
complaining that the Customs
man is often a long way off, and
have demanded that the rural
postmaster or postmistress (it is
generally the latter) should be
appointed to overhaul the shud-
dersome mass of fow and pay
the bounty, but the Govt, has
decided that it can’t ask any
woman to inspect and count and
behead all these crates of de-
composed bird, and to run after
the deadest bird of the lot when
it starts off round the corner, so
the present arrangement must
stand. Besides, the present ar-
rangement brings grist to the
mill; many of the fowlers send
their birds along to the Customs
by rail, as may be seen by the
millions of blow-flies that scoot
fter the train—and thea freights
all help business along.
In connection with the recent robberies of
uncut diamonds from Sydney Technological Mu-
seum, why cannot the trustees take a hint from the
precautionary measures enforced by the British
Museum? In that institution, the moment that
any one of the air-tight glass cases is broken an
electric-bell loudly sounds the alarm, whereupon
all doors of egress are immediately closed, so that
the detective on duty can speedily locate and
follow the movements of those persons who were

At N.S.W. Wesleyan conference Loyalty
was at fever-pitch. “ The enthusiastic loyalty

The last memorable outburst of Methodist loyalty
was equally proper and cheap—a week of prayer
for Tummy’s conversion.
The retiring President of N.S.W. Wes-
leyan conference, reports :
Brethren, we are this clay face to face with a brighter
future. The tide of commercial prosperity is rising'; men
of commerce are more buoyant, and I believe that we are

Crowned heads of Europe have always
given their royal patronage to Ed. Pinaud, of
Paris, but never so much as lately ; his perfumes
are now recognised as incomparably the best in
Europe. The biggest hits of Ed. Pinaud have
been “ Yiolette Reine ” (quite different from
“Rhine Violet”), and “Preciosa,” the sweetest
and most delicate perfumes ever made ; in fact,
they are known everywhere as the quintessences
of the richest flowers grown in France, and are
sure to be rushed by everybody.*
Mr. Frank Senior, who has been chemist

laundryman was fined, under the Factories Act,
for working his “ washee ’’-mill after hours, and
Melbourne Conservatism fell upon Sam Yik’s

that he was a martyr to the cause. The fine-
money was raised by subscription, and Sam Yik
smiled right round his head, and went home, and
placidly broke the law more than ever. This time
his fine was £6, and expenses were added, and
Sam Yik, blue with remorse, sits amongst his
suds waiting for another subscription, but his
admirers, recognising suddenly that such a martyr
is likely to become expensive, have allowed him

Up in. the far north
of the Piebald Land, a
freshly-arrived Mahom-
medan lately prose-
cuted a new - chum
Chinaman for some-
thing connected with
wood. It was a blazing
day, and the magis-
trate’s liver was out of
order, he having kept it
up late with the local
sub-inspector the pre-
vious night ; and the
flies and the mosquitoes
raged tremendously,
and a dust-storm blew
continuously. The local
interpreter was missing,
and the court tackled
the case single-handed.
The Mahommedan
couldn’t be properly
sworn for want of a
Koran, and the China-
man was only partly
sworn, because, instead
.of blowing out the
match, the dust-storm
came in and blew it
out for him. The
Mahommedan tried to
explain the charge to
the court and the court
tried to explain it to
the Chinaman. Neither
succeeded. Then the
Chinaman tried to ex-
plain something at
great length, ai d the
court, which didn’t un-
derstand him, tried to
convey his meaning to
the Mahommedan, and
failed badly. Finally
the court drew out of
the contest, and stood
aside while the China-
man and the Moham-
medan yelled in differ-
ent languages at each
other. By-and-byetheir
row lulled it to sleep,
and it dozed off leaving
the policeman to act as
peacemaker and bottle-
holder to the litigants.
It woke after half-an-
hour and found the
policeman gone and the
Chinaman and the
Moslem still harangu-
ing each other incomprehensibly with an idea
that they were getting justice. Then it dozed
off again, and when it woke an hour later both
litigants were gone, so an entry was made to the
effect that the matter had been settled out of court,
and the embodiment of the law went home.
Away down the street a cloud of dust showed
where the Mahommedan and the Chow were still
arguing, with a casual Afghan and a small boy
and a dog and a goat and a superannuated working
bullock looking on. And of such is the course ot
justice in the Piebald Land.

At a Sydney bank, one day last week, the
ledger-keeper had just got to his station at 10 a.m.
and got ready for business, when a grimy hand
passed a grimy cheque over the rail to be initialled.
The ledger-man looked over and saw a draggled
bonnet, with a broken feather in it, and a spirit-
less-looking woman underneath. Then he turned
up the ledger, found that there were no available
funds, and marked the document “N.S.F.” f ‘ I
am very sorry, madam,” he said, as he handed it

woman, but there are no funds to meet this
cheque. Ihe customer reached up the grimy
hand again and took it ‘‘lt doesn t matter
she said, with a little break in her voice. Most
of them are no good. I’m used to it. You see I m
an unfortunate and I got that cheque last night
for drink and immorality.’ And as the mildly-

Bumbledom is more than adequately re-

committee. Several members of this'body seem to
regard the unhappy old folk under their charge
as little better than” aged and useless animals, who
should be knocked on the head without delay to
save the expense of their keep. The asyluin supt.
suggested last week that, in order to enable the
inmates to enjoy a warm meal now and then, it
would be a graceful and charitable act on the part
of the committee if it allowed them to have hot
plates occasionally. The members nearly bit his
head off, and scouted the proposition as an auda-
cious piece of extravagance, which meant coddling
and pampering the inmates. Poor old inmates!
Then the humorous •. Jaffray arose, bubbling
with merriment, and delivered himself of an

Here is a quatrain for Hot-plate Jaffray’s couplet:

“Death equalises all,” as the long-suffer-
ing wife of a tyrannical husband realised when he
was called to take bis seat for the final stage.
There he lay helpless and yellow, his arms by his
side, his jaw slung to his head at last. It
was reported he had beaten her, and with a
woman’s weapon, his tongue. Their life together
had been one long, bitter, endless argument, and
he always had the last word. How the wife felt
this cruel wrong and robbery of her rights oidy
another wife can tell —and won’t. The last few
moments arrived, a rill of pity slowly coursed the
heart-husk of the watching wife, and she said
“ You’ll be better off shortly.” The “ about-to-
die,” with a heroic effort, steadied his quavering
eyes, flashed a world of meaning at her, gasped
‘‘rather ! ” and died like a coward ere she could
retaliate.

“Lady” Munro has again returned to
Melbourne after an absence of some years. As is

orchestra started to play a piece of operatic music.

GIRL.
FOR THE BULLETIN.
BY THE BREAKER
She was a biking girl—a giddy creature,
Who ’round the neighbourhood had wheeled of late,
With figure angular and flinty feature,
An oldish girl—although quite up-to-date!
It was the mellow hour the sunlight lingers
Among the tree-tops-—just ere shadows pass ;
She held a cigarette between her fingers,
And rested, with her bike, upon the grass.
We don't, ourselves, give heed to empty rumors,
But we saw this: just as the sun took flight,
She took'a match, and on those shapeless bloomers
Struck it —quite man-like —and obtained a light.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
. _ _ _ Sydney, March 2,1897.
Mr Dear Mtee— ’
_ _".Matsa ” opened on Saturday night at Her
Majesty’s in a loud hum of expectant excitement.
Among the audience, which was full-dressed half
way to the back of the stalls, there were so many
of the Ancient People that it was Egypt on the
stage and the land of Goshen in front of the house.
The Chosen went down into Egypt for the second
time on record and seemed to enjoy it as much as
their progenitors. “ Matsa ”is a wild, glittering
dream of oriental gorgeousness and profusion;
there isn’t any plot, or, if there is one, it is flooded
by the Nile rising in Act 11, but there are real-
looking mummy-cloths and bright-hued drapery
and Cairene silks and blue-gowned, red-capped
donkey-boys, and almond-eyed beauties enough to
set up a color-enthusiast with subjects for a life-
time. There is a gold-laced Khedive in the midst
of a varigated harem, though it is a libel on the
late respectable Tewfik to accuse him of as many
wives as that. Girls in flower-tinted frocks flut-
ter about the stage like animated roses, tulips and
peonies, amidst a shower of petals, in a gracefully-
designed floral ballet. The “ fire ” ballet consists
of six figures energetically shaking tablecloths in a
lurid glow, and, in the serial scene, Mary Weir
and others hang suspended from the flies like the
little china angels which some folk love to suspend
from their best parlor gas-bracket.
Florrie Young, as principal boy, has many uni-
forms, designed, like most of the other dresses in
Matsa,” by Mr. .Collins-street Barnes, the Aus-
tralian Wingfield in stage-costume designing, who
is leaving for New York shortly. He has the
true instinct for stage effect, and the costumes he
devises always show up well, but while his color
is all right, in form his designs rather need simpli-
fying. Juliet Wray, as an American heiress,
wears a gaudy, spread-eagle kind of frock in blue
and red trimmed with stars-and-stripes and
dollars. In the “ press review,” a girl dressed in
? L ? jETIN cover and a pair of black tights was
the brightest of the row. D’Arcy Stanfield, re-
placing Mrs. Lauri as the neglected Mrs.
M Lonely, wore some black gauze and carrotty
ringlets as a burlesque ancient Egyptian dress,
after the manner of Coleman’s caricature Jap.
costume in “Djin-Djin,” but failed to reproduce
the humor of O’Kiama’s inimitable bloomers.
If Miss Spence, who is standing in S. Australia
as the only woman candidate for the Federal Con-
vention, should get in she will make a good show-
woman for supporters of the female-publicist
movement. An elderly, grey-haired woman with-
out oratorical frills and hysterics, she speaks in
quiet style with shrewd common sense as long as
she is on her own pet topics, and nobody ever
heard her speak on any other. All her travels and
public addresses on her theory of voting have been
er pwq expense. Women have not yet become
enthusiastic enough to part with coin for the pur-
pose of. learning all about the representation of
minorities. _ The worst of the Hare-Spence system
of voting is the long time it takes to count the
votes. I remember a meeting where the lecturess
was enthusiastically recommending her system as
a panacea for all human ills. Its use would pre-
vent bribery and baldness, restore political purity,
the complexion to its youthful color, cure over-
drafts, insolvency, bad legislation, and leprosy,
and generally make this world a little heaven
below. At the end of the meeting there was a
trial ballot conducted by the chairman, a Univer-
sity professor, when it took half-an-hour to count
a couple of hundred votes. '
A heated roomful of seiious-iooking worshippers
met at the Y.M.C.A. Hall on Sunday night to
hear Mrs. Saunders, mother of the two girls
massacred at Ku Cheng, evidently expecting some-
thing sensational in the grim-and-gory line, and
quite prepared to gloat over sickening details.
But the speaker was a mild and motherly old
lady, who merely spoke gently of the iniquity of
horse-racing, sixpenny-nap, whisky, and other
familiar horrors, and never so much as mentioned
an infuriated pig-tail. The chairman, speaking
the address, alluded disappointedly to the
thrilling episodes which their “ dear sister ” could
have told if she had wished, but she had chosen
to give the Gawspil message instead. Then the
choir sang the hymn, “We shall be satisfied by-
and-bye,” while a collection was taken up; but,
judging by the few threepennies in the plate, their
day of contentment must be a long way off as yet.
fund-raising harbor-excursion to Cabarita, on
loth March, with band, moonlight, refreshments,
and all the other adjuncts, has been promoted by
the ladies’ committee of the Boys’ Brigade. Some
of the matrons objected strongly at first to the
expedition going anywhere in particular, and were
in favor of the steamer-load of revellers merely
cruising vaguely around the harbor without
coming to a full-stop. “No landing,” they ob-
jected sternly, “the girls will stray away ” —they
had evidentlybeen there” themselves. But,
after all, the frivolous party carried the day and
a ®u ee u t 0 ave siren give an extra loud hoot to
call the wandering sheep together before starting
on the return journey.
The moral smoke-concerts' held out by'the Rev.
Carr Smith, of St. James’s, Sydney, have been
superseded in favor of moonlight water-parties.
It appears that the womankind of St. James’s
strongly objected to the rev. gentleman mono-
polising their husbands and sweethearts; hence
the new departure. The more “ straight-laced ”
section was much shocked at the billing and coo-
mg of the. young people on the steamer at the
inaugural jaunt; but as there was a corps of
clergy and deacons present—well, Hallelujah !
Autumn and winter shows are made by most of
the drapers now, and from signs millinery matters
are going to be much mixed next season. Hordern
Bros, show hats with flowers, feathers, velvet,
chiffon and buokles all adorning 1 the same crown ;
most of the bonnets are minute, while hats are
large and topply with waving black plumes.
Chapeaux will be tilted still more over the nose,
the hair-knob, which has been climbing higher
and higher up the back of the head, pushing the
millinery forward. Women are revolting now
against savagely stabbing their hats with long
pins: they say that the weapons tear out the hair
and make holes in the straw, and are returning to
ingeniously-concealed elastic. Veils now float
loosely about the face as if they had come adrift
from their moorings, and it is darkly whispered
that it will soon be “common ” to wear the head
in a bag of net, and veils will be “out” altogether.
Recent color-contrasts are striking—red roses and
purple violets trim the same hat, an emerald-green
straw with bright red ribbon bows might have
been built for a supporter of the Cardinal, but
orange mixed with black is just as popular. You
pay your money and you take your choice.
New gown-materials are given some most out-
landish names, but they all amount to this, that
sackcloth in all sorts of glorified forms will be the
correct wear. As “matting” and “checks”
and “canvas,” it appears under many disguises
but always with the same loose texture, which is
such a bad dust-holder that a woman can wear it
for a whole_ day in town without looking like a
perambulating dust-bin, as shedoes in serge orcloth.
For a really high-toned gown there is nothing to
beat a shot-canvas cloth built upon silk, which
rustles opulently when you move. Imitation
rustles are now produced by stiff linen and other
deceptive fabrics, but the only genuine shivering
murmur is given by silk, and can’t be attained
under 10 guineas.
“ The Romance of Corsica” was staged at the
Opera House on Saturday evening, and Monday’s
thin and infrequent audience showed that the
public are not taking any foreign romance at
present. It comes rather stale and irrelevant to
see Jules Simonsen in white cross-gartering hurled
from his love in last-century apparel by assassins
in blue steeple hats and long macintoshes. Miss
Petersen, as the heroine, was stagily-nice in pale-
blue, and got herself up in appropriate white satin
for her wedding ; but the only change in his tog-
gery the bridegroom made was tying his lee's up in
clean white tape. The dresses in general were
new and fresh, and the only drawbacks to the
make-up were the wigs, for which amateurs have
a fatal passion. They will wear them, especially
if there is a scene with powdered hair; conse-
quently they all appear to be suffering from a bad
attack of swelled-head, and years multiply on
them. Some of the music is catchy and flavored
with “I was dreaming ” turned inside-out for
copyright reasons. Two arias, “ For love I fight ”
and “Whisperings,” stand out as being much
above the average, and the words of the second-
named are quaint and fanciful, but there is, on the
whole, too much bandit and big drum in the opera
to make it a success right off the mark.
. Yet more Sydney girls are off to the “ con-
tmong ” to have their musical education trade-
marked by a foreign brand, and, before they go,
are to make the usual farewell appearance.
Yvonne Leverrier, one of the cleverest young
piano-pounders here, with a distinct style of her
own, will play her good-bye to Australia for a
while next Tuesday week at the Town Hall. Con-
stance Evelyn is following in the footsteps of
Crossley, and will be off ’Ome to study ; her final
warble here will occur on 27th March. A new
soprano, Florence Schmidt, has sent out cards for
a vocal trial-trip next Wednesday. A newly-
arrived baritone from Maoriland, who is to make
a public appearance in Sydney this month, has
already been heard with great rapture by feminine
listeners at several sassiety functions. As a set-off
against old-world musician-factories, Prof. Mar-
shall-Hall issues the prospectus of his own har-
mony shop in Melb. for current year.
A remote mining-field in Westralia had its first
funeral lately over a young fellow found exhausted
from want of water in the bush. As there was no
clergyman, the local postmaster was chosen to
read the burial service. The godless collection of
tents had never a prayer-book among them, and
the degenerate citizens were getting desperate, as
there was no time to ride to the nearest township
and back with the necessary ritual. So they tele-
graphed to the place and the burial-service was
sent through per wire and read off the telegraph-
forms as received.
The South Australian Gov. was, the other day,
undergoing the usual loyal presentation of illum-
inated address at a back-blocks township, the
spokesman whereof constantly alluded to His Ex.
as Sir-Thos. -Fowell-Buxton-Bart., ” making the
abbreviation rhyme with cart. The bart. never
smiled —Governors are paid to take little things
like that as part of a day’s work. As to the cor-
rect way of saying “ Fowell ” : it should be made
aristocratically to chime with “Powell,” pro-
nounced “ Pool. ” Sir Thomas Fool-Buxton ! It
is indeed a heavy load.
Girls among the Nicest circles are contemplating
a farewell tea to the departing Lady Hampden
and daughter, and now breathe a sigh of relief at
the return from Hobart of the vice-regal victims,
who, for a time, were thought to be going off from
the southern island in order to shunt loyal
expressions of devotion. It is noticeable that
dear Australian friends” of ex-Grovernment
House contingents get the cold shoulder when
rubbing against the magnates on the other
side of the world. That “distressing cawlonial
familiarity ” doesn’t trouble them much at ’Ome.
Occupations after individuals’ names read oddly,
not only on lists of Convention candidates. The
list of aspirants for membership of Sydney School
of Arts committee last week revealed the entry
“ Name, Mrs. Blank ; occupation, wife of So-and-
so Blank.”
Writes my Melb. correspondent
“ Female Melb., with its usual warm, if short-
lived enthusiasm, is feting and making much of
the ‘ Zenda ’ people. Miss Elliott Page has been
taken up by the Govt. House folk, to whom she
brought ‘letters.’ Miss E.P. is a pretty Ameri-
can with a carefully-disguised accent and a dis-
tinguished manner of wearing her clothes. Miss
Ferrar, helped out by a remarkably becoming red
wig, makes a gracious-looking princess, particu-
larly in the fourth act, when she wears an artistic
white cloth gown with touches of pale-blue. Mr
Julius Knight is the most elegantly-tailored male
member of the co. off the stage. He affects linen
of unusual and vivid hues with ties and ‘ button-
holes to match, and vast enveloping frock coats.
Three additional members of the co. who are to
appear in the next production, ‘The Two Little
Vagabonds,’arrived last week. The two ladies
Misses Terriss and Neilson, are miniature dolls of
women, who look about as smart and fashionable
as if they had newly-arrived from Booligal instead
of that alleged centre of fashion, London.
“The new autumn modes were exhibited at
Flemington on Saturday chiefly on the backs of
the newly-arrived mummers. Melbourne women
with unusual economy, sported for the part
confections which had seen wear before. A
new blue of a rather glaring tone was favored by
the two leading Princess’ ladies. The beauty of
the co. wore a startling skirt of an almost audible
check and a smart roomy whole-back coat. Those
girls looked best who were smartly tailored m
tweeds of the prevailing skimpy cut, and apart
from these Saturday’s gathering was a dowdy
d6mod6 affair, with a distinct flavor of hard-
uppishness in evidence everywhere.
“ The most attractive exhibit at the Cycle Show
is the motor dog-cart which belongs to a patent-
pill propounder. Lady Brassey and Lord Neville
had an exciting sprint in the vehicle last week.
The motor dog-cart differs in appearance in no
wise from the ordinary cart, except that it has
large, heavy-looking wheels and a sort of colonial
oven under the box-seat.
“ Capt. Freeman Thomas and pretty little Mrs.
F. T. (Gov. Brassey’s daughter) go ’Ome for good
in Nov., after the Cup. They will go when the
Governor himself goes for a holiday; but they
won’t come back, and he (probably) will. The
rumour circulated that H.E. will go tg England
tor the June junketings, is, I hear from a direct
source, not true.
“ Guvmentouse people seem determined to
cause trouble by tumbling off their horses. Lady
Hopetoun set the fashion and broke her little nose.
Lord Richard Neville more recently did it, and
broke his collar-bone. Now Gov. Brassey has
followed suit, and damaged both his collar-bone
and his nOse. There is so much grovel at Govt.
House that even the horses are sometimes seized
with an irresistible impulse to fall down and crawl.
“Talking of the recent fashionable Toorak-
Tasmanian alliance, the bridegroom was at one
time universally petted as the beauty-boy of Melb.
society. As years went on he frisked unduly, and
learned how much ‘cold shoulder’ a prodigal is
called upon to swallow. Then one of the revivalist-
fraternity came along and worked a happy change,
with the result that a pacified Providence has now
given the handsome Penitent in marriage to a
highly-connected and rather well-gilt Tasmanienne.
“ Melbourne’s most hospitable hostess and popu-
lar society-leader also upholds the “ blood thicker
than water ” notion. Her gilded halls have ever
been open to the attractive daughters of more or
less impecunious sisters, cousins and aunts, for
whom, given reasonable opportunities, prizes
might be expected in the matrimonial lottery.
With one or two notable exceptions, the damsels
in question have returned to the parental roof-
tree minus lordling or visiting militaire, to score
nearer home. The fame of fashionable doings
and fine connections, in conjunction with their
own pretty faces, has generally helped the re-
turned wanderers aforesaid to the pick of the
baskets in their respective country towns, when
once they had dropped to the salutary doctrine
that half a loaf is better than none.
“ Parson Buchanan, of Brisbane, preaching in
Melb. on his way Londonwards, dispelled the last
vestige of admiration cherished for him in the
hearts of she-churchgoers. He was greatly beloved
of the sex when he first arrived from Baltimore,
but he was younger then, less substantial, more
‘ spiritual ’in appearance. Also, he set a watch
before his mouth and kept the door of his lips
thus guarded against his natural tendency to slip-
shod grammar and construction, misplaced h’s,
and similar atrocities. Now he speaks anyhow,
and his sermons are disjointed things of shreds and
patches. He always affected an occasional
‘joke’; now he goes in for being funny and
familiar, colloquial and autobiographical all the
time. ‘ I like to hear of Christ being weary,’ he
prosed complacently the other Sunday at Dr.
Bevan’s, ‘ ’cos I often feel that way myself.’
“ Fire has providentially driven the respectable,
truly estimable, and godly firm of Beath, Schiess
and Ca out of Manchester, or Flinders-lane, into
Little Collins-street, where arrangements necessi-
tate placing the lady-clerks at the windows amid
their ledgers, day-books, and what not—a most
instructive and inspiriting spectacle. These hand-
some ladies, out of the choicest circles of Goshen,
take not the pens from their lips to gaze through
the plate-glass at the passing flaneur. No;
Tottie tots in oblivion.
“The well-preserved wife of a one-time Vic-
torian departmental secretary, finding very little
encouragement to pursue palmistry as a profes-
sion, now lives privately. At the present time
there is no demand for a high-class magic and
spells emporium in Melbourne. Even the shilling
fortune-tellers are often driven by necessity to
go forth and do a ‘ day’s washing ’ for a client.
“ One hears of another lamb snatched from the
sassiety marriage-market by a lady bar-tender,
but sassiety mustn’t complain, for such captures
have been few and far between of recent years.
Only two modern instances are quoted on ’Change.
A while ago, the son of a respected Supreme
Bourt J udge married a somewhat statuesque Hebe
from a well-known hostelry in Rue de Collins.
Ouite lately, the youthful son of a city merchant
well known in connection with the last banking
exposure took a said-to-be fascinating liquor-sales-
woman for better or for worse. Probably the
damsel was a deserving case. It needs a wise bar-
maid-so the men say—to win an uppah-class
character 111 hght that beats upon her
“That plucky little lady, Mrs. Colin Longmuir
(only daughter of the late Dal. Campbell), and
her partner seem to be satisfied with the results of
their soup and entree factory for the supply of
Melb. restaurants. Which reminds one that the
whirligig of time is a wild humorist. It was the
mamma of Mrs Longmuir’s partner who, many
years ago, caused a policeman to be brought into
tot. James Church to arrest a digger for his inde-
cency in wearing a jumper in place of a coat.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.

Electors ,-I am strongly opposed to Federation as un
called for, and a needless and useless expense It will h.
the ruin of Tasmanian farmers, and I ask for your suddoh
and vote to enable me to defend their interests at forth
coming Convention.— Norman Cameron.
Bendigo Evening Mail refers pathetically
to the “ dead-head campaign ” of Vic. candidates
for the Federal Convention. “With the exS
tion of Dr. Quick and Mr. Simon Fraser, no can
didate has published (at his own expense) even the
briefest statement of his federal policy.” In short
only two candidates have given electioneering
advts. to the hungry Mail. It’s soandalous. *
Tas. democrats are running four candi-
dates for the Federal Convention, and three of
the four have been approved by a joint committee
on which the Executive Council of the province
was represented, not to mention the University
the Chamber of Commerce, and other heavy
bodies. A unique result surely, but one which
indicates that the democrats of the Land of Lots
of Time don’t sleep quite as persistently now as
they have done hitherto.
Now said—and it looks very probable in-
deed—-that the Q. Ministerial pressure on Cham-
berlain to appoint an Australian Judge to the
Privy Council, from the date of Byrnes’s intro-
ductory motion in the Federal Council onwards
was all on behalf of Windeyer—a graceful
recognition of his—hum—courtesy in visiting
Queensland and hearing the appeal which resulted
in the oversetting of Lilleyk judgment against
M‘llwraith, Palmer, and others connected with
the stinkful Q.N.B.
First Premier Reid said he would not go
to England—it was impossible. Then he said he
would not go unless he was pressed to go by people
and Parliament. Now, he says he will go unless
people and Parliament prevent him going.
As to taking a title: —“ I have come to this con-
clusion-well, it is a pretty open secret that if I
had wished to be Sir George I could have had the
title—(cheers) —but I consider that as the repre-
sentative of New South Wales a plain ‘Mr.’ is
quite good enough.” (Loud cheers.) “Call me
George—plain George.” Alas ! we have all heard
that before !
Prof. Maartens, arbitrator in the Costa
Rica Packet case, has awarded <£3Boo to the
owners, <£3150 to Capt. Carpenter, and .£l6OO to
officers and crew-total, <£8550, as against £25,000
claimed. The amounts bear interest from Nov.,
Jl, and there are £250 costs against the
Hutch Govt. This strikes an outsider as
very fair justice. Capt. Carpenter was on
a whaling cruise with his Sydney - owned
barque in the neighborhood of the Moluccas
m JR and was imprisoned by the Dutch
on a bogus charge for four weeks, during which
tune hu. ship lay idle, and part of the anticipated
profits of the cruise were necessarily lost. For all
this owners, captain, officers, and crew were
reasonably entitled to heavy damages. But it
seems to have struck somebody that there was a
soft scoop in the business, and instead of proceed-
ing with the cruise when Capt. Carpenter was
released the vessel was sold at a sacrifice, and the
cute commercial gents of Sydney twisted G.
Republican Dibbs’ tail and made him roar a de-
mand for £25,000. The result gives the owners a
little more than the vessel’s value—apparently
plus sale-receipts and minus costs; and Capt.
Carpenter, his officers, and crew get a very reason-
able solatium though there must have been a good
(eal of trouble and expense in the interim. On
tne whole, the Costa Rica Packet case gives pretty
poor support to the policy of biting more than
you can chew.
COMMON PRAYER OF THE FEDERATED
PROTESTANT POPES OF N.S.W.
Outside, do keep the Cardinal we pray Thee, Lord
Divine,
And send Thy chosen one instead, with our own
chosen nine.
And, lest the ten’s to Thee unknown (there’s thirty-
nine beside),
We name the “ bunch ” and pray Thou wilt suffi-
cient votes provide ;
Tor well we know, tho’Thou may’st not, Australia
will have hurt
If Cardinal in Convention-room but gets his hat
and skirt.
For he has vowed a secret vow all heretics to burn,
And only to obey his Pope, and our good Queen
to spurn.
And, as “all’s fair in war,” Thou know’st, we’ll
use “ the Devil’s ’’ ropes,
And in our own Conventicles we’ll tyrannise like
Popes.
Big changes are impending in Q. Ministry.
Swelled-head Byrnes talks of accompanying Never-
mind Nelson to Queen Vic.’s unparalleled shivoo,
and Tozer is to be left at home—sitting like a big
spider in the centre of his web, gathering the flies,
Cunning old Groom has just been made chairman
of a commission on the land laws— he’s squared.
Glassey’s eyes are fixed on the dangled portfolio of
Minister for Labor—no harm in him. Philp is tract-
able, and Lilley is too tired of rusting in private
life to boggle about terms. There remains Mac-
donald-Paterson, still buzzing away at large.
Once he is caught Tozer doesn’t care much about
Drake, who has no following, and, besides, is on
the brink of marriage. Everything considered,
matters are coming on nicely. Apropos, some
people whisper that Byrnes’ intimacy with father
ISelson is not unconnected with circumstances of a
domestic nature. In a word, it is averred that
Byrnes has a heart.
THE BLOOD THAT JACK SPILT.
Having heard that the White Knight Fitz-
Gibbon has in hand another poem in honor of
Queen Victoria and pastor Fitchett, a Bulletin
bard, with a view of getting in early, pours out
thus:—
This is the parson lean and long, that wrote the Deed;
both steep and strong 1 ,
That built the yarns of blood and thunder,
That sent the Hosts of Europe under,
That made each tar kill twenty French,
Or a hundred Rooshians at a pinch ;
For the land whose great and glorious Queen
Has sixty years of salary seen,
And made a “ lifer ” everv bean ;
For the Crown that rules'a thousand creeds,
That squared the savage man with beads :
That worried the blacks
With rum and tracts,
That starved poor Pat,
That fed the Fat,
That robbed the poor,
That spilt the gore
That lies at the door
Of Hingland !

Fiji, vice deceased Thurston. Macgregor has
spent nine years at his present post and, taking
him officially, is considered about “as good as
they make ’em.”
John Trezise, the forgotten pioneer ore-
dresser of Broken Hill, died the other day in
retirement in S.A. Trezise 10 years ago (he was
then in the B.H. Prop.’s service) looked upon
jigging as the one possible means of profitably
handling the lower-grade Barrier ores.
Journalist: “I was on a large Australian
paper, and will call the machinist’s name Spiegel-
berg—not a bit like it. The sub-editor always
knew the state of Spiegelberg’s mind by the beats
of the machine. He would say ‘He’s angry,’
‘Sulky,’ ‘ Jolly.’ Then would come a rapid, ner-
vous beat, like flogging a buck-jumper, earth-
quaky, shaking the building. Sub. rushes down-
stairs, yelling ‘ Spieg" berg’s drunk ! ’ ”
One of the char-
acters of Perth in the
pre-mining era was
Tommy Narragut, an
aboriginal. Tommy
was an inveterate
draughts-player, and
would earn many a
big pfeller beer by
“taking down mugs”
who didn’t know his
powers as they talked
largely in different
bars. Another check-
er-board enthusiast
was then Colonial
Secretary Barlee, and
one day when he was
talking draughts a
bystander airily offer-
ed to produce a
blackfellow to beat
him. Barlee laughed
at the audacity of the
thing, and said that
if any nigger was good
enough for him, he
would take his hat off
to him for ever after-
wards. The challen-
ger quickly found
Tommy, and led him
to the Govt, offices.
.£lO a side was put
up, and black and
white took their re-
spective colors and
began. The darkey
carried off three games
running, and Barlee
paid over his tenner
more astonished than
riled. He was as good
as his word, though,
and ever afterwards
when he passed Tom-
my in the street he
would respectfully
doff his hat.

Miss C. H. Spence, the S.A. Convention
candidate, will be 72 this year. Her father was
town clerk of the first Adelaide city council, and
he died more than half- a century ago. Her
brother was a Ministerial colleague ten years since
of Downer, Q.C., Education Minister Cockburn,
and “ Jim ” Howe, all of whom are candidates tor
the present Convention. Miss Spence is the Aus-
tralian apostle of effective voting.
Benj. Hoare, now principal leader-writer
on Melb. Age, was not only once a compositor,
but he for years also edited Geelong Times, a

that Hoare first styled the Age the “ Daily

An Australian abroad
to The Bulletin : — A strik-
ingly - handsome, magnifi-
cently-muscular man is San-
dow, the modern Samson.
The strongest man in the
world, said by anatomists to
be physically perfect. His
equal in muscular develop-
ment has never existed, un-
less history overlooked the
fact. It is grand to look
upon such a man and know
that he is the perfection of
muscle you might have been
had you but developed a
youthful inclination to sys-
tematically and in order de-
velope each individual muscle
as per Sandow’s simple rules.
One likens him to a Greek
god naturally, though, judg-
ing by the statues of the
Olympian athletes et hoc
genera, Sandow, with his
broad, expansive forehead
from which the short, crisp
hair curls up and away, the
clear, ready eye, and decisive
tone of command, would be
strong enough, clever enough,
and quick enough to “ out ”
half-a-dozen of those sleepy-
eyed, stunted - foreheaded
gladiators of the past. His
chest expands 14in., and
stands out bound, armoured,
and interlaced with muscles
around which sft. of tape
falls 2in. short of meeting.
The biceps, triceps, deltoid,
and trapezoid muscles stand
out on the upper arms and
shoulders prominently like
waves and dunes of sheeny,
pink-flushed marble. The
abdominal muscles at 300 ft.
distance show clearly as the
clean curves on the sea beach
when the tide has ebbed.
With his neck and heels supported, he upholds
four solid-looking men standing upright between
his shoulders and hips. Seated on the haunches
of a horse he swings back from his hips, and
grasping a 1301 b. dumb-bell in both hands
from the ground at the horse’s heels, svvings
upwards to a sitting position, with the bar
above his head, and 150 or 1601 b. of man is
treated in the same way. With his hands he
tears 52 playing cards en masse in halves and
quarters; then 104 and 156 are torn in halves
with but little extra effort. His tour-de-force was
the supporting on his chest of a bridge of 8001 b.
weight, over which a horse dragged a Roman
chariot holding two persons. Sandow would be a
very handy man to have round a bush homestead
to push falling trees off the bark roof, and chip
the jaw of gun-metalled-chinned book-canvassers.

A N.S.W. wool-king, who owns “ whips ”
of city property, and stations in at least three
provinces, and who is allegedly an enthusiastic
Protectionist, was asked, the other day, for a sub-
scription to the National Protection Union. In
response he sent a cheque—for 10s. 6d.
'Bus-boss Carey, chairman of Sydney
Daily Telegraph, is in future to be officially
known as “ President ”of the D.T. Co. At the
shareholders’ meeting at which this proposed in-
novation was assented to a popular lady, who is
one of the chief proprietors, attended and said she
had no objection to the change if it gratified
Mr. Carey’s vanity, but she (practical woman !)
strongly objected to any increase in the fees of
directors.
The Taylorian mantle of alliteration has
fallen upon John Norton, of Sydney Truth, who
alludes to statesman Farnell as “that flabby, fat,
flaccid, frothy and flatulent piece of political pre-
sumption, and paradoxical piscine expert, the
podgy little m in who sits in Parliament and mis-
represents Hyde.”

The Mayor of a certain Australian capital
is scornfully talked about as sure to come in for
knighthood next June. The magnate’s previous
sphere of usefulness is said to suggest punning on
the word “ knighthood.” For that matter, there
are ribald persons who declare that his Worship’s
guests ought not to be asked to banquet it la carte.
A coasting skipper, on the Melb. -Sydney
line, is a quaint old boy capable of assuming a very
pompous air. Occasionally on a hot day he
puzzles passengers at dinner by hailing: “Steward,
stop the punkah ! I am about to use the pepper.”
Then : “ Thank you, steward. I have used the
pepper—you may again allow the punkah to con-
tinue cooling the room.”
Kingston is the only lawyer on the
Democratic side in S.A. Assembly.
Dunedin Fish is a fine mob-orator, and
when he meets a hostile audience (which
is often), if he cannot beat it with argu-
ments he does so by brute force. Once, in a
suburban drill-shed, he addressed an awful
meeting which had sworn to “flatten him
out.” At the back of the hall, it was whis-
pered, were a dozen police and a swift horse.
Fish began—“ Mr. Chairin’’—when Sheol
broke loose, and the hall became dark with
the rain of dead cats, stale pigfish, and
mouldy eggs. When the rain ceased and the
gaslight struggled through the awful stink,
the chairman and supporters were gone, and
Fish, streaming with decomposed custard,
struggled from under the heap of mortality,
and recommenced his speech, only to be
stopped by howls, cat-calls, cats, and farm-
yard noises. Fish waited, and in about an
hour, when the audience had exhausted its voice
and ammunition, he rose above the wreck and
waded in. At 9.30 the audience began to feel
sorry for itself, and at 10.30 it voted the
speaker a jolly good fellow, and passed a
unanimous vote of confidence with the
scanty remains of its larynx. Then Fish
went home dirty in body, ruined in clothes,
but in soul triumphant.
Rev. E. G. Moberly goes from an incum-
bency in the'North (N.S.W.) to a chaplaincy in
Suva, Fiji. Moberly was a well-known figure on
most of the Q. goldfields about 30 years ago, but
somehow never had the worldly knack of collect-
ing stipends. He was starved out of town after
town, and when he shifted to N.S. Wales the old
curse folio wed him. He is scholarly and liberal,
and is a brother of the classical Bishop'Moberly,
of English University life. He has probably
married more bush couples and baptised more
bush children than any other parson.
A legal correspondent:—
Dear Bulletin, —Re Judge Windeyer and the Macleod
bigamy .appeal: Windeyer’s judgment wasn’t upheld
by the 1 ' Privy Council. The Councillors decided
the case on an utterly rotten point taken by
themselves, and didn’t even enter upon the con-
sideration of the question on which Windeyer and
the other Judges gave their judgment. So far as
that is concerned, Windeyer’s judgment still stands as a
dissent from the majority of the Court, and if the point
arose again it is the judgment of the majority which
would be binding. All the same, I think the men who
know most about it consider Windeyer’s judgment good
law. But it isn’t the law of N.S.W. until the Privy
Council says so on some future appeal.
A N.S.W. barrister always exhibits a con-
siderable degree of temper if questioned concern
ing the Great Seal of England. This is the reason,:
In his ’Varsity days he was one of the “ greenest’
youths that ever attended a temple of learning.
When he entered the Law School he was told,
and seriously believed, that the Great Seal 61
England was kept in a tank, and that the Keepei
of the Seal was the man who fed it every day.
A man, reputed from his correspondence
to be a millionaire, has been negotiating for
months past to buy most of the big properties in
Riverina. Several squatters and others went to
the expense of having their places valued and set
out in detailed description, believing trade immin-
ent. But the “buyer ” turned out to be a penni-
less lunatic, with the gift of a deft pen and royal
mind, who was a couple of weeks ago sent off to a
madhouse.
It seems to be regarded as pretty certain
that had Premier Turner been a bachelor he
would neither have bitten at the knightly hook
nor accepted the Chamberlain invite. Turner
risks shaking up his private practice by leaving
Vic. even for three months, as his clients are used
to his personal attention. He works in a dirty
little office at the top of a smellful staircase. The
plaster shows through the shabby paper where he
sits back in his broken-armed chair. When at
work he is always coatless.
At the conclusion of the case for the
Crown in a trial held at Sydney Central Criminal
Court last week, Mr. Wise, who defended accused,
rose and remarked that perhaps the jury did not
wish to hear any address. Mr. Justice Simpson,
the presiding Judge, said that it was not the cor-
rect thing for counsel to interfere in that way.
Mr. Wise replied that he had done the same thing
before Sir James Martin, who approved of the
course. Then his Honor : “No doubt, Mr. Wise,
you have done many remarkable things in your
time.” The prisoner was convicted.
Premier Seddon, while in Adelaide, made
a pilgrimage to the grave of the only child born of
George Grey’s marriage, which died more than
half a century ago. The mother was a daughter
of Admiral Sir R. W. Spencer, who in 1839, at the
time of the wedding, was Govt. Resident at King
George’s Sound. Strange to say, Brookes, super-
intendent of the cemetery, who pointed out the
grave to Grey on his visit to Adelaide in
1891 and to Mr. Seddon, was an official of the
Supreme Court when Grey was Governor of S.A.
from 1841 to 1845.
r A far Northern Bulletin correspondent
thus obituarises Christie Palmerston: —
Died the other day at the Straits Settlements Christie
Palmerston, perhaps the best bushman in the Northern
Territory, and one of the most successful of early prospec-
tors. Was on the Hodgkinson in the early days, and was
the first to blaze a track from Mourilyan to Geraldton.
In the early eighties Christie prospected the Daintree, and
became blind there through incautiously handling
poisoned spears and afterwards rubbing his eyes. Guided
by his blackboy, Palmerston regained civilisation and
ultimately his eyesight also. Had wonderful tact with
the blacks, with whom he hardly ever quarrelled ; was an
unfailing revolver shot, and never meddled in the conju-
gal concerns of aboriginals. Nothing pleased him better
than to ride into Herberton bootless, hatless, and _in
rags, with a troop of naked myalls at his heels. Married
late in life but could not pin himself down to civilisation;
visited the Raub, Borneo, and ultimately the Straits, where
he died

George Ash, of S.A., the first Federal
candidate to die, passed away with his last libel-
action unfinished. It was no fault of his, for the
fighting solicitor shoved it along to the very la;st.
Ash was aged 38 —the age at which most journa-
lists seem to die. He had some exciting experi-
ences in the Kaffir war. Then he came to S.A.,
and was an editor for ten years till a huge slander-
suit ruined him ; and finally he became a lawyer
and a politician, and the business partner of his
political enemy, Premier Kingston. • He waS a
successful, though ineffably dreary advocate, with
an elocutionary style that was dust and ashes ; he
was a debater of insufferable length ; and he
afflicted with a Toryism that was past all remedy.
Ash died mainly through trying to work 20 hofirs
per diem. Another theory is that he did work
20 hours per diem without serious injury, and
that it was an attempt to extend his working day
to 22 hours which killed him.

Premier Reid, if he goes to London, will
re-organise the N.S.W. Agency-General, and pro-

Vic. : “ The first thing every candidate for
the Federal Convention does is to declare vehe-
mently, and almost ferociously, that he never will
‘desert Mrs. Micawber! It almost looks like

N. : “ Gillies was absurdly out of touch in
handling Federation, at his meeting in Melb.
Athenaeum. He had come red-hot off the steamer,
gobbled up morsels from M‘lntyre, Murray Smith,
and Sargood, and mixed a haggis.”
An electoral law-point of grave interest to
certain N.S. Wales Parliamentary candidates :
Half-castes, whose fathers are unnaturalised
aliens, are disqualified for the franchise. The full-
blooded black has a vote, but the half-caste is in
the peril stated.
Britishah : “I claim that my beloved
Hindoo fellow-subjects of Her Gracious Majesty
the Empress—whom God assoilise !—must be
allowed votes for the Federal Convention. Nay,
I would propose Tarboosh Abdallah, the man-im-
porter, as a candidate.”
Now that Vic. Premier Turner has become
a knight and has decided to go to England and
grovel, it is about time Isaacs and Peacock tossed
up for the reversion of the Premiership. Turner
can't go on this wild career long without leaving a
vacancy, and Isaac A. Isaacs ought to be his suc-
cessor when the vacancy comes. The Chosen
Race has been waiting a very long time for its
turn at the helm in Australia.

Cairns (N.Q.) Argus
wears sackcloth because
Kanaka boys who only got
10s. a week in Geraldton,
Mackay, or Bundaberg are
rushing Cairns district and
asking £1 to £1 ss. per
week ; and says : ‘ ‘ As there
is no organisation among the
farmers here to fix the rates
of pay, they readily get
w hat they ask for. It is
time some step was taken
to fix the maximum pay
of South Sea Islanders.”
That is the difference bet
ween White Australia and
Leperland. The former is
worrying for a minimum
wage for whites, and the
latter about a maximum
wage for niggers.
J. T. Walker, of Syd-
ney, says Premier Nelson
told him “it was the young
Australian Native party in
Q. Assembly that opposed
the northern province join-
ing the Federal Conven-
tion.” This is of a piece
with the impudent declara-
tions of discredited Q. dele-
gates to the Federal Coun-
cil that “Queensland would
not have ” this or that. As
Brisb. Courier points out,
Queensland’s opinion has
never been asked, and Govt,
has carefully shirked asking
it. The only “young Aus-
tralian” in Q. Assembly
who deliberately opposes
Federation is Nelson’s pro-
tege, Byrnes, the apostle of
Tory reaction.
A few of the N.S.W. towns which claim
to have special advantages entitling them to be
the Federal Capital: Armidale, Albury, Bathurst,
Eugowra, Glen Innes, Goulburn, Hornsby, Kiama,
Liverpool, Newcastle, and Sydney.
The Westralian Government is wise in its
generation. By standing out of the Federal move-
ment till the last moment, and then coming in
with a rush, it leaves no time for objectionable
people to hold meetings, and draw up platforms,
and stump the country, and form democratic
organisations. There isn’t even time to find out
the views of candidates, and the ten best-known
men will get in without having to say anything in
particular about their intentions. In fact, W.A.
in the skurry has to “ go it blind.”
The Syrian sore ! Eighty-five more appli-
cations were received from Syrians and Indians
for hawkers’ licenses at Redfern (Sydn y)
last week. The D.S.M. granted all save four.
Quite recently over 200 additional licenses were
granted in the same court to members of the alien
horde. Nearly 300 in about a month !
The illustrious Mr. R. D. Meagher had
the front to bob up again politically—at Bremier
Reid’s Convention meeting the other night,
where he got a hot reception—and now his press
barrackers protest that it is cowardly to kick a

ling to be metaphorically kicked let him stay
down. Dean stays down.

The Bogan
scrub-cutting, it
is believed, won’t
be worth any-
thing to N.S.W.,
after all—except
as a perpetual loss
in the shape of
interest on the

Those who know
the country well
say it was origi-
nally timbered
with large trees
of yellow box,
pines and other
woods. Ring-
barking destroy-
ed these, but the
seed from the
large pines find-
ing a free outlet
sprang up in
thousands. This
is the scrub now
being cut down
by pauper-labor.
The land is still
full of seeds, and
when the place is
bare once more
another growth of
pines will take place. Already in the places first
cleared indications of this are noticeable.
The present Federal campaign isn’t many
weeks old, and already one candidate has retired,
one is dead, one has been oommitted for trial
and fined .£5O for contempt of court, and one,
at time of writing, was dangerously ill. None
of the four was on The Bulletin’s Federal ticket.
This paper begins to think that its 40 candidates
are the only healthy ones in the crowd.
Yic. : “Deakin has been reminding his
electors that his Parliamentary career extends over
18 years. An elaboration of how not to do it.
Another example of a statesman who thinks he
can govern with the fag-end of his mind. Deakin
and Shiels, rather superior Wrixons, with their
verbal magazine-articles get the reputation of
Barnave and Vergniaud in the French Revolution.”
Downes Carter, Treasurer of the Patterson
Govt., who sustained confidence by haunting
Colhns-street with a drawn smile, was put up to
do all the gushing over the recently-returned
Gillies, and he prated a great deal about Duncan’s
“ cool head.” Whereat David Syme : “ But cool-
ness is a characteristic which the public only asso-
ciates with the cheek of Mr. Gillies.” In point of
fact, the head of Gillies would appear to have
been reduced to the temperature of his heart.
One of the latest wild-cat political railways
is that which is being constructed from Hughenden
(N.Q.) to a point 35 miles in the direction of
Winton. Afton Downs and one or two other
squattages will benefit by the line, but nothing
else. Where the line is going to, eventually, no
one seems to know. If Winton is the objective
point, then the route takes a curve southwards
and looks fairly like jerrymandering. And just
won’t there be a row between the interests along
the Central line from Rockhampton, which line is
also aiming at an extension to Winton !
One of the humors of the Federal election
in N.S.W. is the candidature of John Bridge, of
wool fame. He has published one short address,
the only lucid statement in it being that because
his firm is well known his customers ought to vote
for him. He has not spoken anywhere near
Sydney or suburbs, but wanders around back-
block towns on the Northern rivers—where doubt-
less he thinks his audience will not be too critical.
His brand of Federation embraces military, tele-
graphs, and law purposes only; but his speeches
are mostly in favor of Protection, and agm the
Government.
It is expected that the four S.A. Ministers
who are standing for the Federal Convention
(Kingston, Holder, Cockburn, and O Loghlin) will
be among the front half-dozen when the contest is
over. Solomon, who aspires to the leadership of
the Opposition, is spending more than all the
other Federation candidates put together.
The admission of Sargood into The Bul-
letin’s Convention “ bunch ’ was admittedly a
sop to Cerberus, but the inclusion of Fraser and
Zeal in the Age “bunch ’’ can only be put down
to the personal interposition of Dawvid Syme.
Fraser is Scotch, ye ken. Moreover, Zeal was a
witness for Dawvid in Space v. Time, a legal
action of the stone age.
PROMISING FOR DE BROWN.
DAUGHTER: “So you do consent to my marrying Mr. De Brown ; I thought you
didn’t like him.”
MOTHER: “I don’t; hut I should like to he his mother-in-law!”
As in State functions the Speaker and the
President of the Council precede all Ministers,
some hair-splitting constitutionalists argue that
Chamberlain erred in passing over these officials
and inviting mere temporary Premiers.
Card. Moran’s address— had plenty
of time for the preparation of it—was perhaps the
most disappointing and humiliating step in connec-
tion with his candklature-sofar. Helucidly explains
his idea of an Australian commonwealth : “ That
each state shall continue to enjoy the most perfect
freedom of action consistent with the well-being
of the Commonwealth, while at the Same time the
Federal Government shall be invested with full
authority to weld all the states into a strong, united
Australia.” In other words, “ I believe in travel-
ling rapidly at a moderate pace so far as is con-
sistent with due velocity, yet without giving way
to what might be called excessive speed, and I
shall remain stationary with reasonable rapidity
while endeavoring to get over the ground at the
rate of a certain distance in a time to be hereafter
decided without committing myself,”
THOSE PREMIERS.
They might have stood to fashion here
A nation new and grandly free,
Have made their simple names how dear
To generations yet to be !
But, no, each servile spirit craves
To hasten to a land afar,
Where they may posture as the slaves
Behind a Queen’s triumphal car.
DANGERS OF DELAY.
A Flagman upon the railway delayed—the express
rushed on, and a score of lives were lost.
A nurse girl neglected the child in the park, and
the littls one was drowned.
A father was so busy he had no time to think of
himself, and so common symptoms ran into a
fatal disease.
A mother was so absorbed by her children that she
did not notice her own danger until it was too
late.
A million people neglect and delay, when, if they
only realised, their whole happiness and very
lives are at stake.
A pain in the back, Lassitude Melancholy Faint-
ness, Irritability, Prostration, all
serious kidney difficulty.
A headache, Coated Tongue, Irregularities, Cold
Feet, Weak Pulse, Constipation, unmistak-
ably prove deranged kidneys or liver.
A delay or neglect at such a time may mean
everything—may mean life or death.
A prompt use of the only standard remedy for
such troubles, Warner’s Safe Cure, is the part
of wisdom.
“A word to the wise is sufficient.” ‘Are you one
who can accept a timely suggestion, and hence
avoid the
Consequences of Neglect?

It is not news to Australians to hear of
a strike, but a “ strike among smokers ” is rathe r
n 0V j i ™his form of a strike has recently eventu-
ated through the enormous demand for “Cameo”
cigarettes having exhausted the stocks held by the
merchants, and the refusal of the public to accept
any other brand in lieu of “Cameo.” Smokers
preferred to dispense with their smoke pending
fresh supplies of their favorite “ Cameo,” which
have now arrived. *

SPORTING NOTIONS .
Last year The Bulletin selected the New-
market Handicap winner (Maluma) in one try ; the guess
this year was pegged back to second place. Wait-a-bit
ran among the leading three horses from start to finish,
but when it came to a final dash chestnut Carlton fairly
beat the thicker-set colt from Ballarat. Twenty-seven
horses started for the Newmarket. Prom a batch of
eight “ fancies” named in this column, six finished among
the first ten —Wait-a-bit, Coil, So-and-So, Ayrshire, Sun-
burv and Reka. Also Carlton was picked as one of a
little lot of “ probable winners during the V.R.C. meet-
ing.” .
A decided “tip ” for Carlton could be gleaned
from his appearance at the post. Tom Hales, greatly dis-
tressed by the death of his wife the other day, would
have withdrawn Carlton right away but for the fact that
a lot of stable money had been invested on what was
thought too good a thing to scratch under any circum-
stances. Splendid chances are not generally sacrificed to
sentiment on the Turf, or anywhere else. Hales gave the
horse its “chance of a lifetime,” and won a big stake.
“ Unlucky in love, lucky in play.”
The story of the Leger surprise is soon told.
Newhaven wasn’t in first-class fettle ; Resolute, although
pretty sound on his feet, seemed rather short of work.
The Officer had been doing well, and appeared likely to
win if he were not bustled. W. R. Wilson and manager
Macdonald made a careful inspection of Sam Cook’s
champion before the race, and came to the conclusion,
presumably, that one or other of the two outsiders could
beat the favorite in a fast-run race. Resolute took New-
haven along at a killing pace, whilst The Officer lay off
within easy distance of the pair, until required to make
his effort. Then he rushed by them, and the race was
won.
The Officer’s Leger-time was Gfsec. faster than
the previous best on record, and about 53sec. better than
the average time for ten years past.
None of the Flemington touts uttered a warning
note re Newhaven’s condition. The matter with the Cup-
winner just now is a sore place on the “ elbow,” and
thereabouts, of his near fore leg, which he moved very
stiffly, not to say lamely, after the Leger gallop. Such
a nasty and noticeable sore that several lady critics as-
sumed an air of gentle sympathy and said “ poor thing ! ”
Before this week is out, the V.R.C. stewards
will possibly find occasion to cast their eyes back upon
the betting for the Essendon Stakes, last Saturday.
Fadladeen and Bloodshot, then favorites for the Aus-
tralian Cup, ran very much “unfancied” in the weight-
for-age race. Bloodshot was meeting Coil on 101 b. better
terms than their Australian Cup handicap, yet Coil started
at 3 to 1, whilst Bloodshot had no stable-backers at 10’s.
Little things like this set punters thinking. Bloodshot,
carrying Bst. 121 b., ran second for Melb. Cup, and was
now being backed at short odds to win the Australian
Cup under 9st. 91b. Yet he was a knocked-out outsider
for the Essendon Stakes, in which he had to carry 9st.
only.
A good deal of the joekeyship at Flemington
last Saturday was painful, but Morrison, on Manfred, in
the Hopeful Stakes, gave about the most excruciating
performance of the day. Morrison “ rode his mount for
all he was worth,” as horse-reporters put it. That is to
say, the boy sat askew on Manfred, just holding the reins
in his left hand and walloping monotonously at Manfred’s
quarter with his right. Meantime, little Redfearn, on his
“blind” side, was peacefully guiding Waraka to the
easiest of victories.
The Sydney horse, Valiant, lost a little ground
in Newmarket Handicap after the public had taken a
“ liker ”at him in the bird-cage. A fine, nuggetty
animal, he would be generally picked as a stayer rather
than a sprinter, and for that matter Wait-a-bit also has
the cut of a long-distance racer. Three of the speediest-
looking nags in the crowd were Ayrshire, Carlton and
Coil, the two latter being nearly related by the blood of
good old Chester.
Cydnus, as The Bulletin had suggested, was a
goner for the Newmarket, The St. Albans stable, after
threatening to be very dangerous in the race, fell back
upon Pilatus, who seemed out of sorts, and was not
backed for the proverbial shilling.
* * * *
The Bulletin waits with breathless interest for
cable-news that another Carbine foal has burst upon the
scene.
* * * *
Gollan’s Norton, who seems likely to start a
warm favorite for the Liverpool Grand National, is an
exceptionally big horse, but a very moderate performer
in England so far, judging from his handicap weight.
How long is it since Norton went ’Ome? The writer re-
members him making a farewell appearance at Fleming-
ton when the Hopetouns were about, and they have been
gone nearly two years.
As regards Daimio and his wasted appearance
when he ran at Lingfield (Eng.) recently, the question is
raised—“ Will a nine-year-old horse, who has gone light
on change of climate, ever regain his old form under the
new auspices ? ”
The steady decline in the stability of Ikey Mo
is quite explained by betting-market reports. Thus—
“ For the Newmarket Handicap Valiant finned to 8 to 1
after 10 to 1 had been taken for £5OO, which was taken to
£5O about Cydnus, who came with a rattle again.” An
investment of £5O on either horse shortened their prices
by two points and six points respectively ! And yet the
awe-stricken horse-reporters continue to prattle about big
bookmakers and leviathans of the ring 1
• * * *
A symmetrical yearling to be placed under
the hammer next Easter is a filly by Niagara out of old
La Belle, the dam of Marvel. As far as looks go this
filly is “ the show of the shop ” at Hobartville.
Marvel is now located at Hobartville, where he
has been doing stud duty. The old black horse is as
30und as when a four-year-old, and looks as if he had
only just come out of work.

Rumored that the Kensington Club, Sydney,
intends trying its luck, ponies v. horse-meetings, on
Saturday afternoons.

The carnival of N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League,
on Sydney Cricket Ground, is a big sporting event with
many aspects. As a speculation on the League’s part it
will either make or break that squabbling institution.
Ever since the great Zimmermann commencement, when
the League scooped close on £2OOO, it has had to draw on its
funds to pay for the meetings which have been failures.
The League now makes a supreme effort for patronage by
offering the public the unrivalled accommodation of the
Cricket Ground, and the best collection of cycling talent
yet gathered together in Australia. All circumstances
augur a big success, but should disaster come there is
nothing left but for the League to bury itself, and for the
name of Gen. Sec. Hunter to be shorn of the fine, large
Christian name of Percy.
This meeting comes as a boon to the trade.
Jan. and Feb. are dead slow months with the industry of
wheels. The carnival will give stimulus to the public s
cooling enthusiasm. The last few weeks the cycling
firm’s manager has had nothing to do but sit in his office
and grow bald through incessant staring at the pictures
of French girls a-wheel pasted round the walls.
The League’s meeting has an aspect for the
Sydney press. The S.M. Herald and Daily Telegraph
are laying themselves out for the advertising boom which
is already manifesting. The D.T. publishes the photos, of
people who were never heard of outside the little circle of
a score of ultra cranks, and the S.M.H. shows equal readi-
ness to bow down to the wheel-god. The recent leading
articles on Percy Hunter’s proposal to make Sydney P-O.
clock-face a poster-hoarding for the League’s advts. were
done as solemnly as if the pushing young man were a
leading spirit in Federation. If the editors of the dailies
take Percy Hunter with such awful seriousness, his next
move will be to offer editors Curnow and Brient £2OO
each for the vacant space upon their shirt-fronts.
» * * *
Only one or two of the Melb. cycle agencies have
risen to the occasion at the cycle-show in the Exhibition
Building, and the majority of the stands consist merely
of several rows of bicycles on a raised dais ; with no points
to distinguish the exhibit from the ordinary every-day
shop-window. The advertising of the races in connection
with the show was a triumph of imbecility. As a result, the
attendance was poor in the afternoon, and only mediocre
at night, whereas, if properly announced, Bilmartin and
Porta’s names would have been good enough for a 10,000
crowd. Martin followed up his Adelaide successes by
collaring the £25 for the First-Class Mile after a desper-
ate battle with Don Walker all the way up the straight.
Walker has done practically nothing since he beat Zim-
mermann, but as he ran Bill to a few inches on Saturday
night his form must be recovering. Megson is another
man who showed one of his old-time sprints in the. heat
of the Five Mile Scratch, when he beat'Porta badly in the
run home. Martin won his heat of the classic event as
he liked, and as Ken Lewis has also qualified for the final
next Saturday the meeting of these two will be looked
forward to with interest. The Bulletin wonders
whether but on second thoughts The Bulletin
won’t wonder. The second and third-class handi-
cap final was a succession of crosses, bores, and
jostles from start to finish, and the surprise is that only
one man, Peryman, was brought down. A number of
protests have been directed against Symonds, and that
gentleman will probably be warned from his wobblesome
habits. A few words to Berry (the son of the Speaker, as
the Argus always has it) on the subject of passing on the
inside would also not be out of place. The races were
very nearly not coming off at all, for with the resignation
of the officials who acted at the Martin-Lewis match, the
L.V.W. has nobody left willing and competent to conduct
the sport.
* * * *
Martin’s Adelaide feat of putting up a world’s
record for a mile (unpaced) of 2min. 2sec. is all the more
meritorious when it is considered that the thermometer
showed 102 in the shade.
* * * *
The inner history of the reinstatement during
late years of one or two disqualified athletes would be
interesting. Such things have been worked in this way :
a man disqualified for alleged crookedness applies for re-
admission and threatens slander actions against all who
asperse him. The final deliberations are private, but the
applicant takes his job to a lawyer, who happens to be a
member of the disqualifying committee or council.
Having no legal privilege, everybody on the committee is
meek as milk, and the disqualified person crawls back to
the racing-path “without a stain.”

Dear Bulletin,—Concerning bowler Roche, I
fancy the loss of index and second fingers and part of
thumb must be just what a bowler wants. The break
must be put on from above or below, just as a screw in
billiards. Now, the depointed thumb can work the one
side and the tip of the little finger the other, from the
bottom, whilst the third finger can do top work. All this
while the “ vis viva ” can be given from the hollow of the
hand. Whole men must lose force by attending too much
to the tips of the digits. That’s my idea. Not worth
much, perhaps, and neither is— Scotty the Wrinkler.

Whenever Charles Godfrey trills his descriptive
song “ Dreams,” at Melb. Opera House, he introduces the
name of a fat metallician, and the most amusing sight of
the evening is to see that booky enter the stage-box just
as the song starts and beam on the staring multitude as
Godfrey yells out his monniker. Who can maintain that
woman is more vain than man ?

Monsieur Lesna, with his Manager of Finance,
his Master of Technique, his valet, his French cook, his
quintette, his quads, his triplets, his baggage, his sundries
and his fal-lals, arrived in Sydney on Tuesday last, and
was given a big reception by N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League.
The League, as a body, doesn’t often get out on the bust,
but when it does it has a very magnificent birthday
indeed. And Tuesday’s affair was the gayest razzle that
the League has yet put in.

The V.R.C. St. Leger has for the past five
years been a race of surprises, such champions as
Camoola, Carnage, The Harvester, Wallace, and New-
haven being successively defeated. Excuses of various
kinds have in each case been offered, but it is passing
strange that Ikey Mo and co. seem to have anticipated
the result every time.

The Queensland horse, Battalion, scored his
second win in N.S.W. on Saturday last, when he carried
9st. 51b. to victory in Rosehill Hep. Though not con-
sidered at the very top of the tree in his native land, he
is far and away the best horse that has crossed the border
for some years past.

Harry Trott’s 61 as the leading score. S.A.’s first innings
started with a fine exhibition of smiting. The fieldsmen
hadn’t done panting after Darling’s threes when they
were called on to chase Lyons’ fours, and when the two
mighty hitters were disposed of Clem. Hill took up their
parable vigorously.
Stumps were drawn on Saturday to the figure of
343 for three wickets. On Sunday rain came to help the
bowlers, and Monday saw the rest of the side go
-down for added 84 only. But 427 was more than
enough to settle the Victorians. Between a rotten
wicket and Carraher, who took 5 wickets for 24
runs, they melted like Monaro snow under the sun
of September. Jones, too, gave his demoniac aid to
the tune of 4 for 28. There was a monotonous and
draggle-tailed procession from the pavilion to the crease
and back again, and the small boys’ sarcasms drew no
flash from the spiritless victims. “ Victoria ” spelt crush-
ing defeat.

Many people, after a long spell of
oppressive beat, suffer from lassi-
tude, loss of spirits, and a general
“run down” feeling. They need a
course of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, a
medicine which has revived and
restored to active life and health
thousands of such sufferers. A lady
recently returned to England from
South Africa writes concerning this
“Wonderful Medicine”
“While in Cape Town the past
summer I suffered greatly from the
long-continued heat. I was com-
pletely worn out; my blood seemed
to become as thin as water, and I
lost all energy and interest in life.
My friends recommended Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and a course of this
wonderful medicine restored my
health and spirits. My husband suf-
fered in the same way as I did,
though not to such an extent, and
he also was greatly benefited from

Townsville (Q.) Star offers “ a prize of £1
Is.” to the “ competitor who suggests the punish-
ment most fitting for the crimes ” supposed to
have been committed by Butler, the man arrested
in ’Frisco. This, because “hanging seems too
easy a death for a fiend of the Butler stamp.” ! ! !
The Townsville Star out-Butlers Butler. He (if
it was he) murdered with a prospect of gold in
sight. The Star isn’t game to commit murder
itself, isn’t game to suggest murder itself ; but it
offers a prize in order to induce others to suggest
murder. It hasn’t even the common honesty to hire
people to suggest murder, but hopes to cheat others
out of JllO-worth of “copy’’for the chance of a
guinea. Thelegalasphyxiation, or spine-cracking, of
a malefactor is none the less murder, when accom-
panied by deliberate blood-licking cruelty. What
is the Star’s proposal but a Raffle for Murder by
Torture? Entrance fee, fiendishness; prize, a
Kanaka’s drunk. Add this, please, to the argu-
ments for the abolition of capital punishment.
For, if these moods be the effect of Gallows on
the supposedly sane and uncriminal mind, what
sort of hardening will Gallows not produce on the
criminal temperament ? Capital punishment is
the heaviest curse that civilisation has attempted
to disguise as a necessity. It confesses failure,
and chains humanity to despair.
A wedding in the Westralian wilds is a
great social event. A Victorian who went over
there with his three unmarried daughters recently
gave the last of the trio away in holy matrimony
to a publican. The bridegroom kept open house
in honor of the occasion, and the whole neighbour-
hood got on such a woeful burst that seven drunks
were found in the bridal apartment when the
bride wanted to retire. They were carried out
and left in a row in the back yard. Then it was
discovered that the bridegroom was missing, and
the most vigorous search among the drunks failed
to bring him to light; the general theory was
that he had got sunstroke and wandered away
into the bush, and the widowed bride wept all
night. Next morning the servant girl gave notice
on the ground that a strange inebriate had taken
possession of her room during the night and she
had been forced to take refuge under the house.
It proved to be the bridegroom, and when he was [
awakened by an energetic process of dry-blowing
he apologised handsomely to the girl and made
things all right. Then the best man was rescued
out of the manger in the stable, and the happy
party sat down to breakfast. After that they
started on their honeymoon in a buggy with the
temperature at 116, but one of the horses dying of
sunstroke they returned on top of a passing ox-
conveyance and decided to dispense with the pro-
posed tour and settle down without ceremony.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

A.N INTERESTING NOTICE OF A MOST
SUCCESSFUL CAREER.

- - - MIRACULOUS CURES.
A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfahne Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice ; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise m
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Bffiod, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W. A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common?” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.
HERE, RASSMUSSEN’S
Testimonials.
A. Few of Them.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and
Biliousness.
160 Eliznbeth-st., Melb.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a
course of your j lfaline Pills completely cured me of a
severe case of biliousness and nervousness. I may also
mention that several of my friends to whom I have re-
commended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them ; therefore, I consider you are deserving of
success, which I do most heartily wish you.—Yours grate-
fully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the
Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testimony carries
special weight, writes thus: To Heir Rassmussen. —Dear
Sir,—l think it my duty to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my
nervous system, and, in consequence, I have recom-
mended them to many friends, who have all been cured
by their use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.
A Much-valued Testimonial from one of
Australia’s Most-Prominent Explorers.
Grand Hotel, Spring-st., Melbourne,
March 7th, 1896.
To Herr R*ssmussen,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform youthat
I have derived great benefit from your celebrated Alfaline
Remedies during my exploring expeditions throughout
Australia, and I consider them invaluable to all travellers
in the bush.—Yours very truly, B. HUTTON
(Formerly a Councillor, Brighton, England).
Witness: A. F. Feker, Manager, Grand Hotel, Spring-
street, Melbourne.
Mr. Buit.iN writes later:—“The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my’ place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.”
A Lady’s Testimonial.
It gives me great pleasure to inform you that your
celebrated Alfaline Pills cured me, when all other reme-
dies and doctors failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of
18 years’ standing. Dear Sir, I shall recommend your
Alfaline Remedies to all sufferers I come across. Anyone
writing to me will have full particulars.—l am, yours
respectfully, Mrs. E. SMiTH.

To uerr Rassmussen.
I ain jubilant to inform you that your wonderful Alfa-

I feel as strong as any young man, and shall always be
grateful to you.—Yours very truly, N. LARSEN.
Skin and Blood Cured.
Canning Mills, Canning, Western Australia.
To Herr Hasmussen.
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline Blood
Pills completely cured me. Previous to taking your
Blood Pills, I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, hut was getting no better ; and I shall never regret
trvino- your Alfaline Pills, as they had a wonderful effect
on my complaint, which several of my work-mates can
testify to. I have recommended your Alfaline Herbal
Remedies to several of my friends, who have reason to be
very grateful for it.—Yours gratefully, J NERVIN.

Parkes Range, Southern Cross, W.A.
I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Blood Pills completely cured me of a serious blood affec-
tion of three years’ standing. I shall always be glad to
recommend your Alfaline Remedies to my friends.—Yours
gratefully, JAMES NELSON WILLIAMS.
A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medioines. When I came to Sydney T had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir _4 hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer
from General Debility of the System for oyer seven years,
and having tried without success several of the leading
doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
trv vour Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did so, for
after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies I am now
completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I was.

reagh-st., Sydney.
A Sufferer Cured of Piles.
I suffered terribly from Piles, but, thank God, I got
immediate relief from your Alfaline Pile Remedies. I
have not been troubled with them since, and it is now
two years ago. I have recommended them to many
friends, who bless the day I told them about it. I cannot

A Cyclist Cured of Piles.
It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one ; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal bind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.

HERR RASSMUSSEN’S
PR€SS : OPINIONS
REFERRING TO
The Wonderful Virtues
OF HIS FAR-FAMED
Alfaline Herbal Remedies.
The Australian Press has fully recognised the noble
mission of Herr Rassmussen, and praise bestowed upon
him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will
not permit to repeat one-tenth of his best Press notices, j
but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-
mation in which Herr Rassmussen is held by the Austra-
lian Press: —
Sydney Bulletin.—“ Herr Rassmussen’s well-known
Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing
many great cures, which his numerous testimonials will #
prove.”

mussen is a clever botanist.”
S.A. Kegister, Adelaide, S.A.—“ Herr Rassmussen’s

Cooktown Courier, Queensland. —“Herr Rassmus-
sen, we are glad to say, holds the highest place in the
colonies as a botanist, and enjoys the confidence of many
leading people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land.”
Flashes (Society Paper), Brisbane, Q.—“ Herr Bass-
mussen’s labors have resulted in a manner most gratifying
to himself, inasmuch as he has received the highest re-
cognitions of the most important scientific authorities.
Chemist and Druggist Journal, Melbourne.—
“Herr Rassmussen has opened a branch depot at lot)
Bourke-street, Melbourne, and his Alfaline Pills will pro-
bably become as well known in Victoria as they are in
New South Wales.”
Evening Journal, Adelaide.—“ Herr Rassmussen
has achieved a high reputation for his skill in manufac-
turing botanical remedies.”
Sydney TrutA “ Herr Rassmussen is sufficiently well
known not to r quire any additionalpraise from Truth.
His remedies are simply wonderful.”

place to mention that Herr Rassmussen has now been be-
fore the public for over ten years.”
JJ.Z. Mail, Wellington.—“ We have among us at the
present time one of Australia’s foremost botanists, viz.,
Herr Rasmussen, the celebrated Danish botanist of
Sydney.”
Tlie Australian Workman, Sydney.—“ Having
seen and examined letters from all parts of the world, we
are assured that Herr Rassmussen’s Alfaline B-emedies
have saved a world of suffering, and his remedies have
cured many people of complaints which were held to be
incurable.”
The Nord Anstralisclic Zeitm.g, Brisbane.-"We
speak from personal knowledge, and can vouch for the
great, cures effected by Herr Rassmussen s wonderful
Remedies. Having seen many cured sufferers, and ex-
amined letters from all parts of the world, we are satisfied
that he is deserving of universal thanks.”
Australian Star, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen is a
gentleman who has gained for himself a reputation in the
medical world of herbal science, and his name has become
known throughout New South Wales and Australia.
The above selected Press opinions are quite sufficient
to show the esteem Herr Rassmussen is held in by those
who have the best opportunity to watch his career.

A Sydney Miracle.
INVESTIGATION BY A REPORTER.
The Interesting Case of Mr. Thomas Jarvis,
WHO SAYS THAT A FEW WEEKS AGO HE WAS
Crippled—Partially Paralysed, Suffer-
ing from Locomotor Ataxia, and Help-
less. Doctors, Hospital Authorities,
AND EVERYONE SAID HE MUST DIK AS HIS
Case was Hopeless. But they were mis-
taken. To-day he is a New Man, full
of Ltfe and Energy, his Crutches he
has Thrown Away, his Dead Limbs have
life, his Appetite has Returned, and, in
FACT, HE HAS A NEW LEASE OF LIFE OUT
and Out.
So much interest has been shown by our readers
in this marvellous case that we have published the
facts again as they appeared in the Australian
Workman a few weeks ago :
One afternoon our representative made his way
to the home of Mr. Thomas Jarvis, 45 Crown-lane,
Ultimo. He was discovered nursing a two-year-
old baby, and his face declared him to be one of
the happiest men in Sydney. He was up and
about and able to answer the knock at the door.
In reply to the preliminary questions, he said :
“You want to know all about my case ? Well, I
am glad of an opportunity to tell you. The facts
may be of value to those who are stricken as I
was.”
“ How long were you suffering ? ”
“ Well, twelve months ago I got so bad that I
had to leave off work, and I have done nothing
since then. About five years ago, next Christmas,
I met with an accident. I was badly scalded
while taking a bath in Pitt Street, Sydney. Since
the accident I have been in failing health, and
after four years of gradual developement of the
malady,'l was forced to gi ve up my billet at the
Glebe Island.”
“ What were the symptoms ? ”
“ Simply indescribable. The pains were some-
thing terrible. They were just about as much as
I could bear. They were for all the world like as
if a saw were cutting my bones in two in every
part of me. I had no control over my bowels and
bladder, and was a nuisance to myself and every-
one else. I was incessantly shivering and shaking,
and could neither eat or sleep. On the 23rd
March last I saw a well-known doctor, and he told
me that my case was utterly hopeless. However,
he gave me an order to the Director of Charitable
Institutions.”
“Did you make use of the order?”
“No, I came home and went to bed, and have
been pretty well in bed ever since. Eive weeks
ago I could not walk across the floor; in fact, I
could nofc.get out of bed. I felt then that it was
all over with me, and only a question of days
when I would give up the ghost. My doctor Was
attending me, and did all he could, by opium and
morphia pills, to ease the agony I was in. I was
under him for five or six weeks. He came to the
conclusion that I was suffering from locomotor
ataxia, or progressive locomotor ataxy, a disease
of the spinal cord, characterised by peculiar dis-
turbances of gait and difficulty in co-ordinating
voluntary movements. He told me that I might
last for ten years, and that I might never get the
use of my legs. (Just then the patient kicked his
legs about with energy to show that medical
opinion is not infallible.) Well, iust as a drowning
man will grasp at a straw, I grasped at an idea
conveyed by the advertisement describing the cure
effected in the case of another boiler-maker in
England, which I read in the Australian Work-
man, by Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People.
I read in the ad vertisement of a case which seemed
to fit my own. I determined to give the Pink
Pills a trial anyway, and sent for a box. The
effect was as marvellous as it was magical. I was
able to eat and sleep as though nothing was the
matter with me. It was the first appetite and rest
I had for many a day. It was incredible. I im-
mediately left the bed and was able to move about.
I have taken four boxes of Pink Pills during the
past four weeks, and am now taking the fifth box.
I can walk about with the aid of a stick, and am
gradually, but surely, recovering my former vigor
and vitality. You see these crutches here?
They were made for me before I got Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, but I was too weak to use them, and
now I don’t want tliem. All I want is this stick,
and I hope soon to do without it. You see I am
rapidly regaining my strength.”
“ He is 100 per cent, better,” said Mrs. Jarvis,
who had come in and taken the baby on her knees.
‘ Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have saved his life, and
made another man of him. ”
A friend who called in at this point, said that
Jarvis looked ten years younger that day than he
did a fortnight previously.
“I can now,” continued Jarvis, “have a cold
bath, and all the feeling has come back in my legs.
If I keep on going the way I am, I hope to be able
to resume work as a boiler-maker, and you know
I have to be in the very pink of health and
strength to work at that trade. lam better to-
day than I have been at any time during the past
five years. I ascribe all the change and benefit to
these Pink Pills. They have saved my life. lam
in no pain now whatever, and feel like a new man.
On the mantlepiece there is a box of opium and
morphia pills which the doctor gave me to deaden
the excruciating pain. But they can stay where
they are, for Ino longer need them. Everybody
who knows me has been amazed at the change in
me. They can hardly believe their eyes. My
being about again has caused quite a sensation out
here.”
Such is the remarkable history, and confirms
what is said in all the chief newspapers of this
country of the astonishing cures wrought by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. They cure
locomotor ataxy, partial paralysis, and spinal
disease, also the many disorders which arise from
an impoverished state of the blood, such as
anaemia, pale and sallow complexion, general
muscular weakness, indigestion, loss of appetite,
shortness of breath, pains in the back, nervous
headache, &c.
These pills are a tonic, not a purgative. They
are genuine only with the full name, Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People, and are sold by
chemists and storekeepers generally, or the Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Company, Queen’s Place,
Sydney, will forward on receipt of stamps or post
order one box for 2s 9d, or half-dozen for 14s 9d.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. _ It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE. —Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the hack and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tam worth, N.S. W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly' and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” —Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

The use of cocaine as a local anaesthetic
is being condemned in the London hospitals,”
writes The Bulletin’s correspondent, “in favor
of eucaine hydrochlorate, called eucaine for con-
vienence. Dentists will welcome the new drug
and gladly discontinue cocaine, the injection of
which is so frequently attended by nervous dis-
turbances and actual danger. Eucaine is non-
ansemic, antiseptic, and less poisonous than
cocaine, a drug that very often developes an ac-
cursed craving for it almost as fatal as the desire
for morphine.”
A very hot, tired correspondent to The
Bulletin :
Went for a trip out West with a guide. Alighted at a
place. Some women with enormous sleeves and men
with flowing pants—camels, Afghans, Chows, heat and
“cuss.” “ Hello!” I said, “ a fashionable place?” “Yes,”
says my guide, “ Bourke.” Went on. Train stopped; I
wondered what for. Looked round; saw a horse chew-
ing rag, a dog, and a pub. “What place?” I asked.
“ Byrock,” he answered. On again. In an hour we
stopped. This time I saw a woman : she got into the
train—her first trip. All the family came to say goodbye
—three urchins, a man, and something that was once a
woman. “Well, goodbye, Liza,” says “Something”;
“ take care o’yerself.” “ What’s this?” I asked. “Oh,”
says my guide, pointing to the group, “ them’s Coolabah.”
On again, with Liza. “What are we stopping for?” I
asked presently. My guide looked out of the window —
so did I. Saw a William-goat and his Nancy. Woman
was holding out a piece of bread and calling “ Nan ! Nan !
Nan!” “ Girilambone 1” said my friend, shortly. Still
on. Passed bark hut (put your hand down the chimney
and lock the door). Two pigs and three children are
playing outside ; and a woman hangs out clothes. I look
up questioningly. “ Selector ! ” was the brief comment.
Five miles further on saw several huts together—a cow,
vegetable garden and a real woman. “ Squatter,” he
sighed, and somehow I sighed too. On till we heard a
whistle, felt a sudden bump, and stopped right in front
of a policeman and a station. Gazed around, and saw on
one side dust, on the other a horse bogged to its knees in
mud. “ Well ?” “ That’s Nyngan.” “Ohl ” I said, and
wondered whether the folks live in the mud or in the
dust. Half-an-hour’s sleep—wakened by falling on to the
opposite seat. “ Look out ! ” said my guide. I looked
and saw some standing posts, some iron on rubbish heaps,
empty bottles and jam tins, stiffened animals, and a Jew
rubbing his hands over flattened roofs. “That’s Never-
tire ! ” lam still Nevertired.
A Maoriland correspondent to The Bul-
letin :
One notable feature of the M.L. election was the
smash-up of the Liberals in the three electorates com-
prising the Hawkes Bay province. Napier and Waipawa
have been wrested from the Govt, by two of the wealthiest
land-owning mediocrities in the province. In Hawkes
Bay “Capt.” Russell, also a wealthy land-owner, beat
Govt, candidate Fraser by about 800 votes. Last election
Russell only beat Reardon by 70 votes, although the
Liberal vote was split, the Govt, candidate stone-broke,
and this election run by a couple of penniless clerks.
Strong men are scarce in H. 8., and good men avoid the
province because its alleged Liberals are the most cranky
and cantankerous lot in the land of aggressive atheists
and crusty Presbyterians. Geo. Hunter, who beat the
Govt, member for Waipawa, is a decent sort of fellow
who has spent about four figures trying to get into Par-
liament, and whose only revealed capacity for legislation
is his ability to flood the electorate with bad beer.
“ Capt.” Russell, leader of the last Opposition, is the sort
of gent who imports every thing—even his pyjamas—
direct from England, and whose hobby is to raise and
command a standing army and run M.L. with cheap
labor. R. D. M‘Lean, who drove the Govt, out of Napier,
is the wealthy owner of Mareakakaho Station, a good
employer and a believer in a milk-and-water form of
theoretical socialism ; the practical brand he considers to
be closely connected with nitro-glycerine. Altogether,
Napier, Hawkes Bay and Waipawa elections are beautiful
examples of the fact that when mediocrity armed with
little money is attacked by mediocrity and plenty of
money the moneyed mediocrity wins the day.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I cannot blame you ; though a passing bell
Toll in my ears, and deaden other sound,
And light be dimmer as the years roll round •
I cannot blame you—you have chosen well. ’
I loved you—love you ; but lam not weak ;
You would not know it, looking in my eyes ;
My heart-ache is not shown by tears or sighs •
The colour has not faded from my cheek.
When first I knew I did not start nor cry
I think I smiled ! we did not stand alone ;
And though my heart seemed stiffened’ into
stone,
No keen-eyed watcher guessed my agony.
How can I blame you ? Never definite word
And never promise passed between us two ;
You never said you loved me, but I knew, ’
And what your own heart whispered my heart
heard.
Did you not love me ? Ah, the passionate bliss
Of sudden meetings when we feared to speak !
For strongest feeling ever makes us weak,
Being too strong for spoken word or kiss.
Did you not love me ? Ah, the joys and sorrows
Of those past days ! the walks, the silent rides
Down the long valleys, up the steep hill-sides—
Ah, friend ! the sadness now of these to-morrows !
I knew you loved me in those days of old,
But Prudence bade you pause a little while;
And so you waited—with your look, your smile
That still beguiled me when your love grew cold.
And then you saw my soul was made to roam
Above convention, on a wild bird’s wings;
I could not settle down to humdrum things,
Or be oontent to care for house and home.
You loved me—yes; but much against your will;
I was too bold, too modern, and too free;
Outspoken as a woman should not be—
You disappeared, although you loved me still.
One of the two must conquer, one submit;
Which would be harder, which more full of rack—
For me to rein my fiery spirit back ?
For you to spur your soul to roam with it ?
I see it all; the life-long fight for me,
The crushing of all bolder flights of thought,
To gain a place at last, too dearly bought,
By death of individuality.
Far better as it is. And yet, the pain !
Not even the Modern Woman can conquer
Fate.
It is so hard to work, and watch, and' wait:
I love you, dear, so dearly ! though in vain.
And you, you choose the well-worn path of life—
You wish no straying from the beaten track ;
Not even you could call my wild soul back,
Nor mould me to your will, the model wife.
I cannot blame you, for I love her too,
Graceful she is, and gracious, pure, and sweet;
True woman she, from dainty hands and feet
To shining hair, a fitting mate for you.
Go to her, and be happy ! Fare you well; —
Leave me ! You know that I shall always pray
For you and yours ; but on your wedding-day
I hear no sound but of a passing bell.

A West Coast Incident,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The tram from Queenstown to Tee-poo-kana was
3ust about to start. _ On the platform were the
local doctor, some children, a woman, two diggers,
and the inevitable Salvationist. The diggers
stood a little apart. The taller and younger of
the two seemed flushed with excitement, though
he spoke calmly enough. He had been lucky and
was going home. His friend—not his mate, for
they were hatters —had come to see him off.
Won’t they be glad to see me ! ” says the lucky
man, following up a train of thought.
“My word,” agrees the other a little sadly. He
has not been lucky.
“ Wish the old jigger was ready to start.”
t You’re in a hurry to leave us, Ben.”
“Well you know,” said Ben, apologetically;
then brightening : “ There’s the wife and little ’un
looking out for me.”
“Yes, I forgot.” This softly. The speaker
also has a wife and “ little ’uns.”
“ Wish you’d make your pile, too, Ned,” said
Ben. gently.
. Thanks, old man. I’ll hold on up at the Spur
till the train comes. It’s a good enough show.
Let s sit down.”
They seated themselves on the unfinished brick-
work of the new station-house.
“ Give ’em all my love, Ben,” said Ned, after a
while.
“ You bet I will, old man.”
“ Take your seats, please ! ”
“ She’s ready at last,” said Ben.
He half rose and slipped back. Ned has risen,
and stands waiting. Then he suddenly bends
over the other with: “Ben! Ben! My God
he’s in a fit.”
He calls out to the doctor, who is just getting
into the train. The doctor comes and examines
the fallen man.
“ Is it a fit, doctor ? ”
“No, he’s dead ; quite dead.”
Ned is supporting Ben’s head on his arm when
the Salvation person comes along and looks down.
“ Dead,” he ejaculates solemnly, “and quite un-
prepared. ”
“ How do you know that ? ” asks Ned, fiercely ;
“ answer for your own soul—if you’ve got such a
thing.”
The Salvation man smiles pityingly. He is a
very zealous officer. “I’ve observed the young
man’s way of life,” he said; “I fear he has not
found God.”
Ned allowed the woman’s arm to replace his
own under the dead man’s head, and rose to his
feet.
Very pale, he confronted the Army man, and
hissed out : ‘‘ He didn’t want to find your God,
anyway.”
The zealous officer would improve the occasion.
“I’m afraid, my friend, you are also following
on the broad path that leads to ”
The rest of the sentence was lost.
When Ned came back to attend to his dead he
said he “ didn’t feel so bad now.”

[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Y’ortee do something, Ernie. Yer know how
I am. You don’t seem to care. Y’orter do some-
thing.”
Stowsher slouched at a greater angle to the
freasy door-post, and scowled under his hat-brim.
t was a little, low, frowsy room opening into
Jones’s Alley. She sat at the table, sewing—a
thin, sallow girl with weak, colorless eyes. She
looked as frowsy as her surroundings.
“Well, why don’t you go to some of them
women, and get fixed up?”
She flicked the end of the table-cloth over some
tiny, unfinished articles of clothing, and bent to
her work.
. “But you know very well I haven’t got a shil-
ling, Ernie,” she said, quietly. “ Where am I to
get the money from ? ”
“Who arsked yer to get it?”
She was silent, with the exasperating silence
of a woman who has determined to do a thing in
spite of all reasons and arguments that may be
brought against it.
“Well, wot more do yer want?” demanded
Stowsher, impatiently.
She bent lower. “ Couldn’t we keep it, Ernie?”
“ Wot next?” asked Stowsher, sulkily—he had
half suspected what was coming. Then, with an
impatient oath, “You must be gettin’ ratty.”
She brushed the corner of the cloth further over
the little clothes.
“ It wouldn’t cost anything, Ernie. I’d take a
pride in him, and keep him clean, and dress him
like a little lord. He’d be different from all the
other youngsters. He wouldn’t be like those
dirty, sickly little brats out there. He’d be just
like you, Ernie ; I know he would. I’ll look after
him night and day, and bring him up well and
strong. We’d train his little muscles from the
first, Ernie, and he’d be able to knock ’em all out
when he grew up. It wouldn’t cost much, and
I’d work hard and be careful if you’d help me.
And you’d be proud of him, too, Ernie —I know
you would.”
Stowsher scraped the doorstep with his foot;
but whether he was “ touched,” or feared hysterics
and was wisely silent, was not apparent.
“Do you remember the first day I met you,
Ernie ? ” she asked, presently.
Stowsher regarded her with an uneasy scowl:
“ Well —wot o’ that ? ”
“You came into the bar-parlor at the ‘Crick-
eters’ Arms ’ and caught a push of ’em chyaeking
your old man. ”
“ Well, I orltered that.”
“ I know you did. You done for three of them,
one after another, and two was bigger than you.”
“Yes ! and when the push come up we done for
the rest,” said Stowsher, softening at the recol-
lection.
“ And the day you come home and caught the
landlord bullying your old mother like a dog .”
“ Yes ; I got three months for that job. But it
was worth it ! ” he reflected. “ Only,” he added,
“the old woman might have had the knocker to
keep away from the lush while I was in quod. . .
But wot’s all this got to do with it ? ”
“ He might barrack and fight for you, some day,
Ernie,” she said softly, “ when you’re old and out
of form and ain’t got no push to back you. ”
The thing was becoming decidedly embarrassing
to Stowsher. Not that he felt any delicacy on the
subject, but because he hated to be drawn into a
conversation that might be considered “soft.”
“ Oh, stow that !” he said, comfortingly. “Gi
on yer hat, and I’ll take yer for a trot.”
She rose quickly, but, recollecting that it was
not good policy to betray eagerness in response to
an invitation from “Ernie,” she restrained her-
self.
“ But—you know —I don’t like to go out like
this. You can’t —you wouldn’t like to take me
out the way I am, Ernie ! ”
“Why not? Wot rot ! ”
“ The fellows would see me, and—and ”
“ And . . . wot ? ”
“ They might notice ”
“Well, wot o’that? I want ’em to. Are yer
cornin’ or are yer ain’t. Eling round now. I can’t
hang on here all day.”
They walked towards Flagstaff Hill.
One or two, slouching round a pub. corner,
saluted with, “ Wotcher, Stowsher ! ”
“ Not too stinkin’,” replied Stowsher. “ Soak
yer heads.”
“ Stowsher’s goin’ to stick,” said one pi-ivately.
“ An’ so he orter,” said another. “ Wish 1 had
the chanst.”
The two turned up a steep lane.
“ Don’t walk so fast up hill, Ernie; I can’t, you
know.”
“ All right, Liz. I forgot that. Why didn’t
yer say so before ? ”
She was contentedly silent most of the way,
warned by instinct, after the manner of women
when they have gained their point by words.
Once he glanced over his shoulder with a short
laugh. “Gorblimme!” he said, “I nearly
thought the little blank was a-follerin’ along
behind ! ”
When he left her at the door he said: “Look
here, Liz. ’Ere’s half a quid. Git what yer
want. Let her go. I’m goin’ to graft agen in the
inornin’, and I’ll conre round and see yer to-morrer
night.”
Still she seemed troubled and uneasy.
“ Ernie.”
“ Well. Wot now ? ”
“ Sposin’ it’s a girl, Ernie.”
Stowsher flung himself round impatiently.
“ Oh, for God’s sake, stow that! Yer always
singin’ out before yer hurt. . . There’s some-
thin’ else, ain’t there—while the bloomin’shop’s
open ? ”
“ No, Ernie. Ain’t you going to kiss me? . , .
I’m satisfied. ”
“ Satisfied ! Yer don’t want the kid to be arst
’oo ’is father was, do yer? Yer’d better come
along with me some day this week and git spliced.
Yer don’t want to go frettin’ or any of that funny
business while it’s on.”
“ Oh, Ernie ! do you really mean it ? ” —and she
threw her arms round his neck, and broke down
at last.
“So-long, Liz. No more funny business now—
I’ve had enough of it. Keep yer pecker up, old
girl. To-morrer night, mind.” Then he added
suddenly: “Yer might have known I ain’t that
sort of a bloke ” —and left abruptly.
Liz was very happy.

The Track to True Eyes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tracks there are in plenty from the Old and from
the New,
But wherever they may lead to, if they do not
lead to you,
Their terminals are vain, and grey and hodden
Are their skies ;
All their trees are cypresses, and all their flowers
are rue ;
All their throstles curlews are—a-wailing in the
dew ;
Hungry is the heart on the tracks that lead from
you,
True eyes !
Tracks there are in plenty from the Roper to the
Bight—
Hellish tracks men only tread within the deeps of
night—
Tracks where the earth-crust splits and shatters,
Like fire-worn delf.
But these to me are flowered with tend’rest hue,
If but the time to walk You-wards is due,
And gay are all the tracks that lead to you—
Sweet self !
Plains that are green with corn, and sun-kissed
mountains
Gushing a song from throstle-throated fountains,
If they lead not to you are full of ashes
And bitter sighs ;
But brimmed is Thirsty Land with grace and dew,
And the condenser track is Golden New —
So long as it may lead to love and you—
True eyes !
When the bloom of thorn bloods Derwent hedges
And the nether lapping of the river sedges
Leads not to you, dear —all the joys of Spring
And I must part!
But, if the greatest gale that ever blew
Should shriek its tempest, I would never sue
Por quiet if its course led unto you—
Dear Heart!
Believe me all I say—believe me true !
I wish to see no sight but thee anew.
Sweet are Life’s griefs, while Life’s tracks lead to
you,
Chromed are black skies !
But, when you die then shall I hasten to
The Doors of Death in sorrow’s sable hue—
Sweet are Death’s ways when Life’s tracks lead
from you—
True Eyes!

The Argus sneers cheaply at the recently-formed ser-
vant-girls’ union, but what class of workers needs union
and organisation more? lam staying at a township
hotel kept by a very nice family, including two grown-up
girls. It is a big and scattered public-house with a large
private house adjoining; the whole of the work of these
two places—which have from three to six regular boarders
and from 12 to 36 at dinner—is done by two servants, ex-
cepting the bar, which is run by the two daughters afore-
said. These two servants are kept continually going between
6 a.m. and 9to 10.30 p.m. Their wages are 15s. per week,
and food— barely 2d. per hour. The owners are very
decent people, and it would be a sin and a shame to call
it sweating; but—what would you call it ?
A Bush Singer .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thebe would be some dishonor in it if she were
caught here with Fenton. But since she came
only to listen to his clever talk, it were better to
crouch behind this well-grassed tussock and let
her husband pass. Fenton had already dropped
to the earth, and slowly, very slowly, he brought
his chin to the level of the ironstone reef. A
sludge-covered man blundered across the gully
below; the wind was against him, and the two
ends of a scarlet rag whipped his bull throat. A
Martini rifle rested on his left arm; the uplifted
right was against the sun.
“ Do you think he can see us ? ” Her lips hardly
shaped the words.
“Don’t know; but there’s so much of him
brute that his smelling powers are abnormal.
How’s the wind ?” Fenton watched her lips.
“ He’s taking the lagoon track, and he’ll come
close in here.”
A sudden gust flung her loose hair across the
wet fronds. A whimper of fear broke the silence.
Fenton glanced at her sharply.
“I object to signals; keep your damned hair
back, or the bull may see the flag. Some jobs
come about, others are put up—keep your hair
back ! ”
The woman flinched and stood erect, stung by
a thought that his words only half conveyed.
Already the husband had blundered into the line
of sight, but his head was down and the sun was
in his eyes.
“Do you mean that, Fenton?” He raised
himself slightly, and the suspicion in his shifty
eyes died out. This trembling, passion-wrung
woman was rather convincing, therefore the gibe
on his lips changed to a wheedling note.
“ I apologise ; _ perhaps he’s after ’possum ! ”
She crouched again, flushed and sulking, and the
swelling curves under the wind-blown tunic made
his lean throat parch. Big boulders at the gully-
end shut out the thick-booted husband ; and the
tailor-perfect man poised himself a little valiantly
to ease his conscience with a few remarks.
“ A slip of the tongue only ; let’s drop it.” The
woman covered her face.
“ I could never see much in your Bill; he works
in a mine, shovels down his food, and whistles
‘The Alabama Coon.’ He hasn’t a peg in his
brain to hang a decent thought upon. Why did
you marry Bill ? ”
“Don’t! don’t ! for pity’s sake. . , . He
carried me out of a building once—they said the
shearers had fired it —and the lead spilled from the
open roof on to his naked hands, and he laughed—-
my God ! he laughed ! —because he held me in his
arms. I couldn’t help marrying him, and I’ve
paid for it—l’ve paid for it! ”.
She rocked forward gently, and Fenton peered
through the dusky nook of ferns, but could not
see her face.
“ Partly the fire, and partly his captivating
bulk ; eh, Nell ? I’m sorry for you, indeed. Long
evenings with Bill will put the frost in your lovely
hair. He carves wooden images on Sundays, and
attends the local spitting-match, and everyone
stands back respectfully when your Bill spits ; he
beats all comers, he beat Nick Jones last Saturday
by three inches ; Nick’s training hard for the next
event, and if the beer isn’t faked he reckons that
he has your Bill under the whip.”
She was standing before him, quivering from
heel to throat.
“ You devil! why do you drag in that ? I could
laugh with you if he were dead ; but death misses
him always, as it missed him yesterday in the
shaft! ”
She watched Fenton dawdle from shadow to
shadow, until the dark myall-belt blotted him out.
She had offended him, and henceforth she was to
be shut up with the man who spat. Fenton was
a singing-master, and he had been teaching her
the diva’s score of “La Sonnambula: she had
sung it in the clear solitude of the ranges and in
the silent bush; sometimes the magpies helped,
and, indeed, they chorused appropriately. And
yet a big stage was just as fine. Fenton had led
her to think of Paris ;he had praised her voice
and compared it with Melba’s ; and Fenton was a
clever dyspeptic who never permitted himself to
say nice things. Astride of these castles was the
bull-throated man who spat. Hands locked across
a boulder, she waited for the coming darkness.
Here and there an overflow had flushed the
jungle floor, and the waters creamed over chan-
nelled slopes of clay to fill a hundred cups in the
rocks. A flapping of wings came above the full
sound of many pools—a wonga-pigeon fluttered
across the windless dusk. She groped into a
lighter space, and her coming sent a flock of teal
uptrailing to the edge of a cloud.
She listened, but her furious pulse shut out
sound. The hut door was open; she stepped in
smiling, and stopped. The sludge-covered, thick-
booted man lay across the table with a gun slop-
ing from his knees. Outside, a sapling thrashed
the window, and the room was grey with the un-
certain light that comes before the dark. He lay
very still; a red splash at his feet sent her back,
stiff-limbed and agape.
“ At last! —at last! ” Her head went up; she
closed her eyes so that her brain might receive the
full measure of esctasy. The bull-necked man
named Bill had gone out of her life; oh, the
sweet pain of it! Her nimble feet lifted to the
tune of her pulse; she whirled across the damp
floor, and the mad motion ended in a pirouette.
Monsieur Delaunay, the dancing master, had
taught her the step—excellent Monsieur Delaunay !
The music had come back to her voice ; she
laughed that she might hear it, and the laugh
ended in a cracking discord. The man stirred,
stretched himself, and stood upright.
‘ ‘ Summat’s frightened yo’, Nell ?—summat’s
frightened yo’ ? ”
His huge body moved nearer to hers. Then he
patted her shoulder, heavily and kindly, because
she had grown suddenly limp in his arms.
“ Easy does it, my gel!—easy does it ! Yo’
drink too much tea, and yo’ think too much.
What’s frightened yo’, Nell?”
“I thought—l thought—oh, let’s think ! ” She
stooped cautiously as if she intended to dabble
her fingers in a pool.
“I thought there was something here-some-
thing red and wet; and it’s only your handker-
chief.” She laughed weakly, and steadied herself
against a chair.
Slowly her mistake shaped itself in his sluggish
imagination, and it flattered him exceedingly.
What a devil of a fright he had given this superb
creature !
The silly tears on her cheek gave him a pang of
pride. He straddled across his chair.
“What’s the use o’ frettin’ about it, Nell ? I
ain’t such a bloomin’ fool as to go flyin’me kite
over the valley of the shadder. Gimme life, an’
plenty of ’ard graft, an’ a bit of innercent enji-
ment on Saturdays. Don’t cry, Nell !—-don’t
cry.”
He touched the hem of her sleeve, it was so
near to his mouth.
ALBA DORION.
Johnson’s Fate,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were swamping back from Lake Darlot rush
last winter with Billy Mills’s camels.
Our pockets were empty, and we had only a few
’weights of gold apiece. My mate, Johnson,
though a tiger for work out back, always de-
generated into a public-house prospector in town,
and I knew that when he had spent his dust he
would chew my ear for my balance in Coolgardie,
so I racked my brain for a plan that would part us.
At Granite Creek, a country of buck-reefs and
barren quartz, I got hold of some porous and
honeycombed stone and artistically stuffed it with
fine colors. This was easy, as I had graduated
with honors in this line, readying up Coolgardie
wild cats for the London market. Sauntering
over to Johnson’s door, I sat down with him on
his rug, quietly dropping the specimens near him.
Ten minutes’ smoking and spitting on the nearest
one disclosed the color to Johnson, who left me
abruptly. Next morning he had decided to camp
at Granite Creek for the next camel-team, as his
feet were too sore to do the 30-mile stage that day.
I departed chuckling.
A week afterwards there was a big rush back.
Johnson had struck it heavy, and within three
months had pegged and sold 200 acres on his
famed Godelphus line—in London.
He is now a representative Westralian in Eng-
land, and in his new role of mining-expert received
50 guineas from a johnnie for telling him what a
winze was.
Oscar Wilde is released, and off to South
America to join his family.
Tom Finney, M.L.A., of Brisbane (Q.) :
“ I met all the Premiers of Australasia in Hobart,
so that now I have the honour of knowing all the
Australasian Premiers personally. I think them
a fine set of fellows, especially that Maoriland
chap, Hick Seddon : he’s one of the finest and
grandest men, speaking as a man, that I ever
met.”
In U.S.A. politics may yet blast futures.
In Indiana two neighbors christened their rival
babies “ Abraham Lincoln Ulysses Grant William
M‘Kinley ” and “ Thomas Jefferson Andrew
Jackson James Munroe William Jennings Bryan.”
Australia may now expect “Frederick Sargood
George Reid Duncan Gillies Henry Parkes Julius
Vogel Smith” and “Graham Berry William
Trenwith Richard Seddon Undesirable Immi-
grants Jones.”

Rerad the following remarkable testimony of Mrs. M. A. Helleur, of
Sussex St., North Adelaide, So. Australia, whose portrait is given above:
“Some years ago, I suffered very severely from soreness and general
weakness of the system, being so badly affected that I feared even to go
from one room to another, on account of the strange objects that appeared
to flit before me. My doctor, after treating me for some time, without
any benefit, at last recommended me to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I took
his advice, and am pleased to say that the effect was really wonderful.
Vigour was restored to my system, my nerves were strengthened, my spirits
brightened, and I was enabled to return to my usual occupations. I might
say that several of my friends and relatives have used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
with like beneficial results. I believe it to be the best health-restorer
that has ever been offered to the suffering masses.”
