Mighty the heroes hymned and sung of old.
Who played the game of war by that great
sea,
Roman , and Greek, and Persian dauntlessly.
No whit less dauntless, and with mien as
bold,
Ours of the newest land and latest mould
Stand where ye stood, and grim as ye would

Fight on, beneath the symbol of the free,
Striking for right, and not for greed, or

Ansae-Australian! linked together noto —
Bring me a lyric writ of those who sleep,
Our lads whom neither shot nor shell could

Whose blood spilt wildly on that awful steep,
Is the rare vintage broken on her prow,
To launch our ship of state in the vast deep!
C. E. MOORIC.
One Man to Four Women
In the ante-bellum days J. D. Beresford
wrote a remarkable novel depicting quite
plausibly what would happen in a world sud-
denly practically depleted of males, by
means of a mysterious epidemic that killed
only men. Goslings was a highly interesting
forecast of Avhat then seemed merely an
author’s fantasy. But that mysterious epi-
demic has suddenly arrived. It has been
engaged since July, 1914. exclusively killing
adult males; and the present indications are
that the disease will continue, with con-
stantly increasing virulence, to wipe out the
adult male for years yet to come. As in
Goslings the females are practically un-
touched by this widespread disease; and it
is with Beresford’s imaginative forecast that
the whole of Europe will, in the years to
come, be compelled to deal. What is going
to happen, say, in England, when the war
is over and the survivors return—to find
themselves in a minority of, say, one to four,
to the females? What will happen to our
marriage and divorce laws when there are
four adult women to every sound adult male?
In France and Russia and Germany the,
problem will not be fatally complicated by
the fact that owing to conscription the slain
males will be a fair average of the male
population. In England, Canada and Aus-
tralia, the dreadful toll of death will be
taken from the finest of our population—the
bravest, the noblest, the most intelligent, the
most patriotic and physically the most fit. And
though the proportion of the sexes that will
constitute the population of Australia after
the war will not be so one-sided as in Eng-
land. where before the war, there was a
million or so of superfluous women, the
problem will be for us just as serious. For
the men who are left to carry on the race
will be composed largely of the inefficients,
the ancients, the slackers —in fact, com-
posed of you and me —and they will find
themselves in a world of superfluous women.
A modest, but praiseworthy, attempt to
treat this looming catastrophe in fiction is
made by Anna Floyd, in The Woman's Har-
vest (Laurie, 25.). Read as a novel the
book is above the average; but it is as a
study of an inevitable social problem that it
possesses its value for this page. The story
is any soldier’s story. Harvey Brunsdon is
employed before the war in a big draper’s
establishment in London. He is married to
the usual shopman’s wife, and has one child.
He feels it his duty to enlist, and his wife
nobly acquiesces. She goes back to work in
the same shop; but the patriotic shop-owner
has to dismiss her because she couldn’t help
weeping in her anxiety over flier husband’s
danger. No shop-owner, however patriotic—
and all shop-owners are patriotic—could
afford to lose customers by a shop-girl’s
tears. However, she manages to get work,
and so waits for the return of her husband
to his job. And when he did return he went
back to the counter. But he couldn’t stick
it. No more could the millions of other men
who had been through the hell of war.
The returned soldier had a new idea of
his own importance. “Having looked death
in the face for months on end, he had no
particular qualms at the idea of facing a
plump magistrate. He had taken positions
in face of German shell fire, and he meant
.getting what he wanted now.” He wanted
land. And he wanted to own his land. And
he had a short way with the professional
lawyers who professed to rule him.
During the : conflict there were ominous
signs to be read by those who watched and
felt the temper of the nation, but as all
classes of the population went on pouring out
blood and treasure without stint at the bid-
ding of the Government, the lawyers who
composed it. went on their blundering way,
smiling, cynical, inept, and entirely confident
of their ability to talk themselves out of any
awkward situation that might arise.
However, a disbanded regiment hanged
four members of the Cabinet on the lamp
facing the entrance to Downing-street. The
ringleaders were sentenced to death, where-
upon the remainder hanged four more pro-
minent politicians. The Prime Minister was
then informed that every evening, while
their leaders lay under sentence, four poli-
ticians would bft punctually hanged. The
Prime Minister, not anxious to be one of the
daily four, released the men. It was no use
calling out the troops: the troops had called
him out. The Army and the people were
one. The legislators preferred legislating to
banging, and promptly did as they were told.
The consequence was that within two years
England was almost a self-supporting coun-
try by the wise State-aid given in settling
the land.
And in the country women preponderated.
Hence when the ex-draper got his farm he
found himself the one able-bodied man among
a community of unmarried or widowed
women. The women had got the vote, but
that was little use to them. As one nice
girl, who always powdered her nose even
when harvesting in the fields, remarks:
“Women are so tragically in the majority
that they don’t stand a chance... .The only
result of the votes for women is to produce
legislation more ‘man-made’ than ever. Now
that there are half a dozen women to every
man, they perforce have to pamper and spoil
him to try to hook him. It doesn’t even
matter whether he’s married or not. He’s a
creature to be pleased, and we had to develop
the arts of pleasing more than ever we did
before. Look at the fashions. Why, five
years ago a woman would have been run in
for wearing such clothes as you can see
every day n0w.... Man likes this sort of
thing, and we see he gets it.... Woman’s a
mere drug in the market, and man puts a
higher price on himself than ever. The
unmated girl simply uses the vote, as she
uses every other thing she has, as a means of
pleasing some man or other.... Wait till
polygamy or bigamy is sanctioned openly.
It’s bound to come.... In a couple of years’
time you’ll be allowed to chose another wife,
Mr. Brunsdon.”
But would any woman consent to be the
second wife?
t “Oh, yes, she would. I’d rather be Mrs.
Number Two than Mrs. Number One. The
second wife would come to a ready-made
home, instead of having to work her fingers
to the bone to make it. Besides, there’d be a
certain amount of consolation in knowing
your husband has picked you out as his last
choice....lt would only mean legalising a
state of things which already exists.”
Well, the one man in the district acts as
the author suggests the husbands all over
England are acting. Babies arrive in the
most unexpected quarters; and his wife
decides that she must make the best of it.
At any rate, she is married to him. And
for every married woman there are three or
four unmarried women, earning their own
living, and more or less unconsciously deter-
mined not to die old maids.
It is an audacious theme, discreetly and
temperately discussed.
Spook River Poetry
Knowlt Hoheimer.
I was the first fruits of the battle of Mission-
ary Ridge.
When I felt the bullet enter my heart
I wished I had stayed at home and gone to
fail
For stealing the hogs of Curl Trenary,
Instead of running away and joining the
army.
Rather a thousand times the county jail
Than to lie under this marble figure with
wings,
And this granite pedestal
Bearing the words, “Fro Patna.’*
TV hat do they mean, anywayt
Margaret Fuller Slack.
I would have been as great as George Eliot
But for an untoward fate.
For loolc at the photograph of me made by
Penniwit,
Chin resting on hand, and deep-set eyes —
Gray, too, and far-searching.
But there loas the old, old problem:
Should it be celibacy, matrimony or un-
chastity?
r J hen John Slack, the rich druggist, wooed
me,
Luring me with the promise of leisure for
my novel;
And I married him, giving birth to eight
children,
And had no time to write.
It teas all over with me, anyway,
When I ran the needle in my hand
While washing the baby’s things,
And died from lock-jaw. an ironical death.
Hear me, ambitious souls.
Sex is the curse of life!
Mrs. Kessler.
Mr. Kessler, you know, was in the army,
And he drew six dollars a month as a pen-
sion,
And stood on the corner talking politics,
Or sat at home reading Grant’s Memoirs •
And I supported the family by washing.
Learning the secrets of all the people
From their curtains, counterpanes, shirts
and skirts.
For things that are new grow old at length,
1 hey re replaced ivith better or none at all •
1 eople are prospering or falling back.
And rents and patches widen with time •
a 0 Jhread or needle can pace decay, J
And there are stains that baffle soap,
And there are colors that run in spite of you.
Blamed though you are for spoiling a dress,
Handkerchiefs, napery, have their secrets.
-I he laundress, Life, knows all about it.
And I, who went to all the funerals
Meld tn Spoon River , swear I never
Saw a dead face without thinking it looked
Like-something washed and ironed.
Nellie Claiuc.
I teas only eight years old;
And before 1 grew up and knew what it
meant
I had no words for it, except
That I was frightened and told my mother;
And that my Father got a pistol
And would have killed Charlie, who teas a big
boy,
Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.
Nevertheless the story clung to me. _
But the man who married me, a widower of
thirty-five,
Was a newcomer and never heard it
Till Uco years after we were married.
Then he considered himself cheated,
And the village agreed that I was not really
a virgin.
Well, he deserted me, and I died
The following winter.
Flossie Cabanls.
From Bin die's opera house in the village
To Broadway is a great step.
But I tried to take it, my ambition fired
When sixteen years of age,
Seeing “East Lynne” played here in the vil-
lage
By Ralph Barrett, the coming
Romantic actor, who enthralled my soul.
True, I trailed back home, a broken failure,
When Ralph disappeared in New York,
Leaving me alone in the city —
But life broke him also.
In all this place of silence
There are no kindred spirits.
llow I wish Duse could stand amid the
pathos
Of these quiet fields
And read these words.
A. D. Blood.
If you in the village think that my work
was a good one,
Who closed the saloons and stopped all play-
ing at cards,
And haled old Daisy Fraser before Justice
Arnett,
In many a crusade to purge the people of
sin;
Why do you let the milliner’s daughter Dora,
And the worthless son of Benjamin Fantier
Nightly make my grave their unholy pillow?
Zenas Witt.
I was sixteen, and I had the most terrible
dreams,
And specks before my eyes, and nervous
weakness.
And I couldn't remember the books I read,
Like Frank Drummer, who memorised page
after page.
And my back was weal; and I worried and
worried,
And I was embarrassed and stammered my
lessons,
And when I stood up to recite I’d forget
Everything that I had studied.
Well, I saiv Dr. Weese’s advertisement,
And there I read everything in print,
Just as if he had known me;
And about the dreams which I couldn't
help.
So I knew I was marked for an early grave.
And I worried until I had a cough,
And then the dreams stopped.
And then I slept the sleep without dreams
Here on the hill by the river.
Editob Whedon.
To be able to see every side of every question,
To be on every side, to be everything, to be
nothing long;
To pervert truth, to ride it for a purpose,
To use great feelings and passions of the
human family
For base designs, for cunning ends,
To wear a mask like the Creek actors —
Your eight-page paper—behind which you
huddle,
Bawling through the megaphone of big type:
“This is I, the giant.”
Thereby also living the life of a sneak-thief,
Poisoned with the anonymous words
Of your clandestine soul.
To scratch dirt over scandal for money,
And exhume it to the winds for revenge,
Or to sell papers,
Crushing reputations, or bodies, if need be,
To win at any cost, save your own life.
To glory in demoniac poioer, ditching civilisa-
tion,
As a paranoiac boy puts a log on the track
And derails the express train.
To be an editor, as I was.
Then to lie here close by the river over the
place
Where the sewage fioios from the village,
And the empty cans and garbage are dumped,
And abortions are hidden.
—From “Spoon River Anthology,” by Edgar
Lee Masters (Laurie).
This is the sort of stuff,
Written by Edgar Lee Masters,
The American “ Bellerive” of a place called
Spoon River —
Presumably, he used to send it in week by
week
To Reedy’s Mikkok, the local rag,
And the editor gratefully printed it.
And now, published in book form, it has
been hailed
By the Boston Transcktpt
As “a masterpiece not of any time or

So he welcomed these posthumous horror ,
And handed the inhabitants a weekly dob nt

Immanuel Ehrenliardt, Seth Compton. God-

Etc.
But, though most of these epigraphs arc as
bald as the entries in “Who’s Who”
And as depressing as Hansard,
There’s a lot of genuine feeling and some
acrid humor and plenty of quiet- pathos
To be discovered if you struggle through this
bulky directory of the spooks.
And E. L. Masters has certainly created a
remarkably varied gallery ' of family
portraits.
But, if he had only taken
The trouble
To put his spook anthology into something
like verse,
Even if he had occasionally bothered about
rimes,
It is quite
Probable
That he might have made a genuine work of
Art.
And, as it is, it is a remarkable piece of imag-
inative literature that should be read
Once—but would require some effort to
struggle through
Again.
All the same, this page hesitates to speculate
upon
What would have happened

“Enby” : “Copabella” (3O/3/16)
that AX.G. iis not an Australian poet
because he “does not get within coo-ee of
the real Australian Bush.” Hang it all,
jumbucks, ’roos, buck-jumpers and brumbies
are not the only features of country life, nor
yet the sole ingredients of our national litera-
ture. Nor, by the way, is the larrikin the
only city dweller. That Gordon is now
published in a cheap edition by an English
firm, and “Life is mostly froth and bubble” is
written in autograph books the world over,
gives us no excuse to say we are not going
to have anything to do with one of the pio-
neers in the field of Australian letters. May
I have a say about our City literature.
The labors of Louis Stoue and his
brother teachers are killing off the
Jonah type. There are not _ many
places in the cities where the larrikin can
thrive: soon decent wages, decent education
and a decent standard of living will make
him as extinct as the Hun. Mdre than hve-
sixths of our population live in the citi * or
large towns; of the remainder only a smai
fraction live in what has become the con-
ventional” scene of our bush prose ana
poetry. The fact is the invasion of tins
territory by the railway and the motor-car
is making our so-called bush literature jus
as true to life as the cowboy stuff of u.o.a.

Rifles
.32, .35, .351 and .401
Calibers
Winchester Self-Loading rifles
are not cumbersome, compli-
cated or unsightly, but simple,
handsome and well-balanced
guns. Their use permits rapid
shooting with great accuracy and
on account of the novelty and ease
of their operation, they add much
to the pleasure of rifle shooting
either at target or game. For hunt-
ing game which is generally shot on
the run, a Winchester Self-Loading
rifle is particularly handy and effective.
The four different calibers in which this
type of Winchester is made are suitable
for hunting all kinds of game, the cart-
ridges they use being of the most modern
type, giving excellent penetration and great
shocking effect. If you are going to buy a
rifle look over the Winchester Self-Loaders.

getting away from the din and roar of the firing line. Then I collapsed,

The Singer.
I sing you a song of the windy weather,
Of the dappled dome of September’s sky,
Ol the crested wave with its white-foam
feather,
And the laughing cloud that is scudding by.
I sing you a song of a grey lark winging
Up from the meadow straight to the sun,
Of clover blooms aswoon to his singing,
Of the silence of earth when his song is
done.
I sing you a song with gladness brimming,
Of rainfall with sunlight glimmering
through.

dimming)—■

Fallen Roses.
Where the bamboos plume and cluster near
the little duckweed pond,
And the bougainvillaea crouches scarlet on
the grass beyond,
You leaned o’er another woman with your
eyes as soft and fond.
In the palms the wind was whispering, some
old tale yet always new,
And I crossed the sward and found her list-
ening, as I had, to you,
All among the crimson roses that like wine-
filled goblets grew.
Roses red and roses white, roses golden, shell-
pink, sweet,
Y\ here the weeping figs are bending and the
asphalt pathways meet
In the shady, scented gardens, hidden from
the dusty street.
You and I, and she and you, ghosts that
paused, and smiled, and bowed ;
Nobody fell pale and stricken, no one wept
nor cried a10ud....
All around were fallen roses, fit to weave a
dead heart’s shroud.

We wake, to stare and stretch amid the

For that we know not; lone, till conscious

Aflame in splendor—Love, life’s hope and

That led us far, to shiver on the verge,
Bewildered, of the swiftly coming night,
Where breaks across our dreams life’s
throbbing dirge.
We waken, wide-eyed, straining through the

Towards new days from out a clouded

And pass, where yet Love’s splendid shadows

To greet the Reaper, o’er Night’s sable

The Better Part.
The Reverend Arnold Marigold
Was curate of St. Swithin’s fold.
Ilis form was slim, Ins eye was clear,
His stipend eighty pounds a year.
He loved most chastely Mildred Bone
Who had no money of her own.
They dreamt that they (the artless two!)
Might wed in nineteen thirty two.
The brewer’s daughter, Molly Bly,
Marked Arnold as he dawdled by.
lie was, this pillar of the Truth,
A very prepossessing youth.
His nerve was sound, his form erect ;
He’d muscles no one would suspect.
And Molly, when he looked her way,
Smiled on him, debonair and gay.
Mildred was slight and full of nerves,
But Molly had distracting curves.
It saddened Arnold much (oh, yes!),
The Mammon of Unrighteousness.
Mildred much hated sin’s dark plague:
Moll’s piety was very vague.
Our Arnold marked this difference well,
And yearned to save a soul from Hell.
So three times weekly, wet or dry,
He talked of Heav’n to Molly Bly.
While Cupid the the naughtiest god)
Got busy with his sting and prod ;
Till Arnold (ah, these tropic climes!)
One night kissed Moll eleven times.
For his excuse the roguish elf
Kissed him full thirty times herself.
Moll owned, to gild this life so drear,
A sweet seven thousand pounds a year.
Yearly she gave five-scove of these
To help convert the smooth Chinese.
Truth starves; but still your brewer is
A comfortable soul, I wis.
Arnold though'; Molly’s money would
Help him to do a lot of good.
So Mildred shortly (ill-content)
To help save slim Confucians went,
While Molly lay. on Arnold’s heart,
For Arnold chose the Better Part.
Tue moral is, ’twixt me and you,
That Arnold knew a thing or two.

“WE HAVE DONE OUR
DAMNEDEST.”
Treed at last, N. S. Wales Premier Holman
had one excuse to offer the Political Labor
League for himself and his dreadful Minis-
try—“we have done our damnedest.” They
have. For once in his life the man was
candid. And their damnedest has been
damnable. Nearly six years ago Labor
secured a majority at the N. S. Wales
polls and went into office, carrying the hope
and trust of Labor electors and the confi-
dence of a not inconsiderable number of
Liberals who had turned with contempt
from the unsavory crow r d they had been
identified with, and looked for a cleaner,
more honest handling of public affairs. The
party took control pledged to very definite
lines of conduct; to a platform about which
no ambiguity existed; to principles made
clear to every citizen. And the record now
can be boiled down to this —that in the
judgment of the community every principle
to which the party stood committed has been
grossly outraged, and the members of the
Ministry know it. They stand on the
wreckage of the platform they undertook to
uphold, without a single claim upon popular
indulgence or charity. Long before their
first Parliament was due to expire signs of
demoralisation were plentiful. Their shifts
and evasions and bluffs and skulkings were
just the old dodgings of the other fellow.
Preaching self-reliance one day they were
the next in full cry after Cohen, and have
been pursuing him like a pack of blood-
hounds ever since. They have done their
damnedest all right —their damnedest to
make the Labor movement a mockery and
a jest.
«■ * ♦ *
In the history of Australian self-govern-
ment no Ministry has shown itself so pro-
fligate or so traitorous. The moment it
seized the administrative machine it started
pawning the State, for the purpose, appar-
ently, of creating a boom and maintaining
itself in office by the simple device of hand-
ing out bribes to hungry constituencies,. and
thus chloroforming the political conscience
of the people. In recent years the public
debt of N. S. Wales has gone up this way:—
1910.. £92,525,095 1913.. £106,170,747
1911.. 95,523,926 1914.. 116,695,031
1912.. 100,052,635 1915.. 127,735,405
During the current year another eight or
10 millions are being tacked on to keep the
record going. On this crazy basis of p.n.’s
and lOU’s these adventurers who have done
their damnedest erected a feeble superstruc-
ture of palliative legislation, most of which
would fall in a heap if the pawn ticket was
blown away. Such a performance might
have been expected from a Ministry com-
posed of the baser kind of Liberals —from a
party of landjobbers and boodlers. That
it should stand to the discredit of a Labor
party is an appalling illustration of how
perfidious party politicians can be, and of
how quickly this particular Ministry suc-
cumbed to the corrupting influence of per-
sonal expediency. This mountain of debt
has been piled upon the people of N. S.
Wales by the Holman Government in order
that through it Ministers could buy votes
in Parliament and at the ballot-box. It is
the price the State has to pay for the
ascendancy of men who were too supine to
be reformers, but crafty enough to see the
possibility of degrading the cause to their
own personal advantage. They have done
this with such a wonderful completeness
that Labor when it succeeds in purging
itself of the shocking incubus will have to
get right down to the beginning of things
again, to realise that its principles are
founded either on Truth or on nothing, to
fight for decency and candor in government,
to win a fair deal for the mass of men and
women instead of a place of patronage for
a few underground engineers; and it will
have to do it, too, under greater burdens
than it started with. Holman and his crowd
have done nothing that really matters for
Labor —except to smirch its name and make
it a cadger on the steps of the Mont de
Pi6t6. Not one problem that Labor was
confronted with has its leader attempted to
solve. He has made every one of them more
difficult. The generous enthusiasms that were
behind him have been wasted, and a move-
ment that sprang from the abuse of govern-
ment by a section of the people has yielded
the Norton Griffiths syndicate, the Great
Cobar transaction, and the Petrol negotia-
tions.
• * *
Had Holman and his Ministers at any
time .shown even reasonable inclination to
fight for the Labor objective, it would be
possible to make allowances for failure and
to condone many errors of judgment ; for no
impartial man can fail to recognise that
the system under which they have worked,
and particularly the inherited curse of party
government, is a substantial obstacle in the
way of democratic reform. But from the
first the Ministry abandoned itself to mere
trickery, to hanging on to its job by'subter-
fuge-, to strangling Labor principles in order
to avoid the harder work of maintaining
them. Ministers degenerated into a collection
of State insects, wasteful and improvident
administrators, muddlers of every State
enterprise they touched, panderers to special
interests and privileges, hopelessly over-
weighted by the responsibilities cast upon
them. Their original sin (and in this it is
unhappily true they were encouraged by the
character of the Labor organisation) was in
imagining that the Labor movement had
triumphed when it secured a majority in
Parliament and that the remainder of the
game merely consisted of keeping in office.
Nothing could have been more fatal to a man
of Holman’s temperament, for he is in all
things the instinctive politician, ever ready
to spread his sails to any wind that blows.
To him it comes much more natural, for in-
stance, to use the Legislative Council as a
pawn in the party game—to maintain it as
a bait for catching mackerel —-than to take
off his coat and fight it on the issue to which
he was pledged. Borrowing money and
splodging it round with both hands for the
special entertainment of Fat is obviously an
easier business than conducting govern-
ment on the principles of self-reliance,
economy and prudence. From one paltry
shift Holman has been driven to another,
until, in the latter stages of his fantastic
career, his Government has come ten be
looked upon, not by a few people, but by
nearly all, as about the ugliest thing Aus-
tralia has known. And all that the calami-
tous leader can now say for himself is that
he has done his damnedest. The quicker he
knocks off doing any more of it the better for
every citizen in the Commonwealth. Also
the sooner will the Labor movement recover
from an indecent debauch and regain its
vision and the use of its legs to w 7 alk
straight.
AUSTRALIA’S PLACE AT THE
BREAKFAST TABLE.
In India they are discussing compulsory
military service just now with some show
of enthusiasm; but it is not quite clear
whether the notion is confined to the com-
pulsion of white men resident there, or
whether there is some idea of limited con-
scription among the native races. India’s
contribution to the great war has been
hailed as something of tremendous value to
Britain ; and as India is a unit in the con-
federation which masquerades under the ill-
fitting name of Empire, it is quite up to
the Indian, native or white, to take a hand
in the tremendous game. With the best
intentions the brown man was rushed to the
Front a few months after the war started,
and the famous soldiers of Asiatic warfare
met German and Turk on the fields of
Europe. We have no means of knowing
the number of the Indian troops actually
engaged; but we can reasonably estimate
that the total was not great. It was in no
way the fault of those troops that they did
not score signal successes. They could not
be. blamed for the fact that they were unable
to endure the cold of the European winter
nor stand up against the diseases of the
European summer. No fault at all is to be
found with the Asiatic soldier either on
the ground of courage or discipline. He
simply did not get there to any extent;
and another fondly-cherished myth was
blown away in the wide-spreading battle
smoke.
» * * *
However, brown men are giving their lives
freely and doing their best; and if a few
Iviplingisms have been turned to ridicule
that is not the fault of Sikh and Gurkha.
What is reasonable under the circumstances
is a review 7 of the position of India as a
member of the British family and a unit of
the so-called Empire. It is the position of
India which more than anything else com-
plicates certain grave Australian problems;
and if India is to maintain her right to a
seat at John Bull’s breakfast-table it is
quite fair that her position there should be
considered by the other children who have to
sit next to her and pass the salt. N. S.
Wales is perfectly free to criticise Westralia
and Queensland in tlieir relations to the Com-
monwealth, and if either of these became a
burden the Commonwealth would have. a
perfect right to decide the extent to which
it was willing to share the load. The place
of any unit in the British confederation and
its value to the whole seems to be fairly well
told by the extent of its war sacrifice. Had
India risen to the same heights in such
sacrifice as Australia there should now be
about 11,500,000 of her troops in field or
camp. On all evidences, the number of sol-
diers actually raised out of her population
of 244,000,000 —or 315,000,000 if we include
the native States which have been whooping
to assist Britain —is less than one-thirtieth
of that number. So that Indian patriotism
on an actual service basis stands to that of
Australia as one to 30. No doubt, against
this it may be argued that India requires a
very large reserve for home defence, the idea
of an attack from without upon the great
brown dependency having for a long time
been prominent in the British mind; but at
the present moment it is difficult to see
where any danger from without threatens
which does not equally threaten Australia.
Further, while India is magnificently de-
fended from the land side by the highest
ranges in the world, Australia has an enor-
mous coast-line and vast waste spaces which
our politicians have not yet been compelled
to connect by strategic railways with the
more populous centres. Every argument in
favor of maintaining a reserve of men which
applies to India applies with greater force
to Australia.
* * * *
India has represented enormous wealth to
England; and in the light of the spoil drawn
from it in the past and the scope it has given
to enterprise it is apt to be judged by the
English mind. When it comes to a settle-
ment of the big after-the-war problems which
face Australia it is quite possible that con-
siderations such as these may be allowed to
have undue weight with statesmen w 7 ho fail
to grasp the real shape and significance of
things. In proportion to population Aus-
tralia’s service has been greater than that
of any of the overseas Dominions; and
while, where all are presumably doing
their best, no one could desire to press the
point or to boast of the achievement, it is
still a ground on which to base a claim for
the consideration of those matters which are
vital to Australia and which stand for
nationhood to us.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
It Is Time to Get a Move On.
Townshend has surrendered; Dublin has
been filled with a deplorable and bloody riot
for a week; German ships of war, heedless
of the watch of the British fleet, have crossed
the North Sea and bombarded an English
town ; and neither on the eastern nor the
western front of the great European struggle
is there the smallest indication that the
Teuton forces are weakening or that the con-
quering march of the Allies is about to
begin. Anybody in Australia who has
hitherto had the smallest doubt about the
need of his personal service has now suffi-
cient evidence on which to act. It is not
merely that things look momentarily black
for Britain; the whole story of the war is of
a piece with these later developments. With
the exception of the retreat from the Marne
at the very opening of the war and the tem-
porary advance of the Russians in Galicia,
the Central Powers have been pursuing a
course of almost unbroken success. The con-
quered territory which they now hold is
pretty well equal in extent to the whole of
European Germany before the war started:
and even at sea they continue to work havoc
and destruction in a fashion that, despite all
explanations and excuses, is getting on the
n a rv ? s . Allied commerce. In the matter
of diplomacy as well as in arms they have
more than held their own. The Turk was
early won over; Bulgaria followed at the
most disastrous time for Britain; Greece
was kept angrily neutral; Roumania has
not moved. The Irish horror, which Berlin
knew could have no real chance of success,
is probably intended as a reply to numerous
American Notes; and as such it must be
sorrowfully admitted that it has a sporting
chance of making the polite Wilson doubt-
ful of the support of several millions of
American-Irishmen whose natural instincts
led them to favor the Allied cause. Obscured
as the whole outlook is by the instructions
of a dull War Ofiice and the absurdities of
the censorship. Australia knows enough now
to realise that things have got very black,
Germany may or may not be making a
supreme effort; it is plainly time that we
made ours. To the pioneering people of this
young continent nothing calls quite so
clearly as real and imminent danger. Civil-
isation is now facing more of it than
it has ever known. While Dublin shakes
America, Kut-el-Amara may shake all Asia
and put a new life into every rebellious force
from Alexandria to Malaya. While others
tremble it is for us to stand firm; and the
place in which the standing can be most
effectively done at this moment is at the
recruiting depot.

The Thing that hr.s Protected Australia,
, ——
Melbourne Trades Council is whipping-up
an inter-State anti-conscription conference
to be held next week ; and. meanwhile, the
arguments against compulsory service are
once more being given shape and form V

The reply to all this is in the answer to a
pie question : Is defence of the national'
ence a civic duty? On the “Yes” or “\ n
that all the rest hinges. If it is agreed ths
it is a duty to defend our country and on
citizenship, then talk about the destructi m
of privileges and democracy and the wickei
ness of Fat is mere blither. I n any case th
invocation of democracy to resist a fiinda'

sound. The Swiss, who are the nearest thin,
to a democracy this unhappy world know"
anything about, have never been heard veil
ing their disapproval of military service N r
have the French, who are much closer t
being a democracy than Australians. It «
true that the Belgians found compulsorv ser
vice objectionable; and the remainder of the
story is mostly tears and misery. Conscrin
tion has protected the democratic institu
tions of-. France and probably those of Swit-
zerland. Anti-conscription hasn't protected
anything in Belgium—not even a cron of
turnips. And John Bull hasn’t found him-
self lately giving three cheers because he
hadn’t conscription, nor have there been
many people in Australia prepared to make
an approving noise on John’s behalf. After
nearly two years of war, the problem is what
it was in the first week—how shall victory
be gained? So far as Britain’s part in the
struggle is concerned, the relative values of
compulsory service and a bogus voluntaryism
were long ago determined. The basic con-
sideration cannot be whether this, that or the
other shall be “preserved,” but whether life
and liberty shall perish. If the Melbourne
conference believes that the defeat of the
Allies and the triumph of Prussianism is
more desirable than that the British people
should accept the civic ideal of the most
advanced democracies on earth—refusing to
do so on the dishonest ground of anxiety
about their own democracy which isn't
democracy—very well! But if the delegates
have their eyes open they must see that it is
only through conscription —somewhere eke
—that Britain and Australia are to-day not
in great danger. Conscription in France has
indeed alone saved us thus far. Are we
going to continue to loaf on that?

Christopher Columbus Holman Discovers
Another Parliament.
The row in which Holman and his Minis-
ters have been involved during the past
w T eek shows up once more the absurdity of
our present governing arrangements. The
people elect the Legislative Assembly on a
one-adult-one-vote basis. The machinery of
election may be more or less imperfect; but
on the whole the Assembly is a democratic
institution fairly representing the people.
If it isn’t it is the people’s fault. But the
Government, which is supposed to carry out
the Assembly’s, and therefore the people’s,
intentions, doesn’t represent the Assembly.
It is not, in the first place, elected by that
body. It is chosen by a caucus composed
only of a portion of the House. It is
notorious that there are men in the present
Ministry 7 who wouldn’t hold their portfolios
24 hours if the will of the people —that is,
of the whole Assembly—prevailed. That
such a thing should be possible shows how
undemocratic is the present system of ap-
pointing Ministers. It is. also pretty well
known that there are Ministers who would
not he retained if the head of the Government
had his own way. Yet we hang on to the
habit of cursing the Premier and holding him
personally responsible for the failure of an
Administration which, to a great extent, has
been foisted upon him. But the position is
still further complicated, and our system is
made still more irrational, by the fact that
the Government has confessed itself respon-
sible to a body which is neither the Assemb j
nor the caucus—a body, moreover, wmc
selected neither the Premier nor any ox nm
Ministers. That a Ministry should not
acceptable to a body which had no say i
its composition seems to be almost the
thing in the world: it would indeed
remarkable if the Ministry chosen by 011
bodv did quite suit another entirely dittereu
body. The serious question, however, *
whether that disfavor ought to afreet
Government at all. No doubt the F- •
Conference has its legitimate uses. ,
constitution has not been determined b.

formed a league representing only tn

justified in doing was to consult the caucus
of the party elected by the people ; they were
wrong, and dangerously wrong, in admitting
that any body outside Parliament has any
right to govern a Ministry in the matter of
holding or quitting office.
Where the Blood-guilt Lies.
This heart-breaking Irish rebellion,
engineered from Berlin, and perhaps for
that very reason enjoying a larger measure
of success than might otherwise have been
expected, can only end in the spilling of
more blood where too much has been spilled
.already. Even if victory had been possible,
the final result could only be bitter disaster.
Every evil that Ireland has suffered at the
hands of England has been due to the clash
ot race instincts. The Anglo-Saxon could
never understand the Celt, nor the Celt
appreciate the Anglo-Saxon. But the Ger-
man is the substance of which the English-
man is only the shadow. By his very
nature he has no conception at all of the
working of the Irish mind. The old partial
Alliance between France and Ireland was
natural and based upon some measure of
likeness of thought and national make-up;
but Prussia and Connemara are utterly
unthinkable in terms of friendship or under-
standing. We do not, however, fix the
blame for the pitiful Dublin bloodshed by
the easy process of crying “Berlin !” It
was Edward Carson who first bought
arms from Germany, at a price at which
arms could not be manufactured, and so
centred the attention of Berlin on the possi-
bilities of an Irish revolt in the event of a
struggle with Britain ; and it was the supine
Asquith Government wffiich permitted the
arming and drilling of great forces of men
whose avowed purpose was to defeat the
will of Parliament and take the field in the
King’s name against the King. There will
be hanging of poor enthusiasts who have
risen with the Sinn Fein cry on their lips;
but the question still remains to be
answered why the armed rebel leader who
in word., if not in act. broke the peace of
50 years] standing was punished only with
a place in a British Cabinet. The Dublin
revolt is the natural sequence of the weak-
ness of a .Government which could scarcely
screw up its courage to make its own mili-
tary officers remain true to their oaths when
their conservative and insular prejudices
were upset by the turn of political events.
Assisting the Enemy.
If William’s War Department has any
Iron Crosses to spare, it ought to bestow a
dozen or two on the councillors of Prahran
and the Melbourne Hospital Committee.
They deserve them —and more besides.
Owing to the lack of a Protective tariff to
balance the difference in wages, cost of
plan}:, etc., this country has for years im-
ported large numbers of common roosts or
perches known as Vienna chairs, made in
Austria. The war having cut off the supply
and altitudinous freights having given pro-
tection against other cheap-labor countries,
a Melbourne furniture-making firm laid
down additional plant and spent time and
money experimenting with woods, until to-
day it is turning out chairs made from Aus-
tralian blackwood, handsomer and stronger
than the Francis Joseph article. That
sounds all right, and when the P’ran Coun-
cil and the Melbourne Hospital Committee
recently invited tenders for bentwood roosts
—the former body wanting 500 for its new
town hall —the Australian firm reckoned the
order was as good as booked. But it hadn’t
gauged the strength of the importing mania
or the shallowness of some patriots’ loyalty.
Both bodies cheerfully rejected the Aus-
tralian article in favor of Austrian chairs
tendered by a Collins-street importery.
There is apparently no question of price
between them, the sole reason given for
rejecting the Australian article being that
it was “unsuitable.” It is said, presumably
in extenuation, that the Collins-street firm
had these foreign chairs in stock since 190 S.
Possibly, then, they are not enemy goods—
though this paper would like to know what
would happen to, say, the Potsdam coun-
cillors if they bought £2OO worth of Eng-
lish chairs, even though they had been made
in 180 S or 170 S. But that doesn’t matter.
The thing that w T ants explaining is why
these bodies spent the public’s money on
imported goods when Australian articles
were on offer, in glaring defiance of public
policy and fervid protestations of loyalty.
Incidentally, the Hospital Committee is
whining again that it is short of funds and
is appealing to the Government to impose
a charity tax on its behalf. There are not
many institutions with impudence enough
to first rob a man of his means of livelihood
and then shake a begging bowl under his
nose. But the Melbourne Hospital Com-
mittee can do it quite comfortably.

Black Brother.
“McNorth” from the neighborhood of Cape
York :—•
Despite the well-meant efforts of Aborigines Protec-
tion Departments and Missions to save the original
owners of Australia from extinction, the rapidity
with which Binghi is disappearing becomes more and
more pronounced as the years slip by. Jacky’s end
is rushing at him with both feet, and there is no
manner of doubt that the adjacent future will see
him referred to only in the past tense. It may be
that it won’t matter a great deal, for people who
are accustomed to secure their dinner with the aid
of a spear have no place in 20th century civilisation.
But as the Commonwealth is pledged to do a sort of
moral justice, and make’ some endeavor to preserve
the race which quietly gave us this continent, it is
up to us to see that the means employed are likely
to achieve the end desired.
Everyone who has an intimate knowledge of Black
Brother and his ways must admit that the means
adopted by the State and the various missionary
bodies are farcical, and, consequently, have been
crowned with failure. The State efforts mostly
crystalise into doling out an annual blanket and
making regulations which are rarely put into effect.
The method of dealing with the spread of syphilis is
a case in point. The Red Horror is making dreadful
havoc among the coastal blacks of Northern Aus-
tralia, and it is pitiful to sec little, innocent children
with the ugly sores that tell of infected parents. Yet
all the Aborigines Protection Departments do when a
black suffering from venereal disease comes into their
hands is to send him to hospital till he is more or
less cured, and then return him to his “country”—
where he straight-away becomes re-infected. Although
there is power to isolate such cases, no systematic
policy of segregation is in existence.
With the Missions the case is even worse. While
the Aborigines Protection Departments’ policy of
letting things slide results in leaving the blacks more
or less to themselves and their natural life, the
Missionary settles in the regions where Binghi
abounds, and pursues a policy of direct interference.
He introduces religion, clothes and European food.
The result is disastrous. Strange foods soon ruin
Binghi’s digestion and set up all kinds of troubles;
clothes, while quite unnecessary, are nothing but
harbors for filth and vermin; and religion inter-
feres with the practice of age-long customs, many of
which are indispensable to the existence of a people
reared in savagery. The nigs, who collect about
the station soon lose their manly attributes, and
become cringing dependents. The outback blacks on
the wide areas usually reserved for Mission Stations
soon become conscious that the presence of the
missionary is an interference with their natural con-
dition, and the end of things begins for them, too.
Incidentally, these mission areas are of huge dimen-
sions. The Mapoon and Weipa mission areas in the
Gulf of Carpentaria, for instance, contain 4840
square miles, no part of which is available for selec-
tion. While doing little good for the blacks, these
Missions are keeping out white settlement by lock-
ing up vast areas which they cannot use themselves.
Binghi’s race is doomed. The spread of civilisa-
tion with its attendant clothes, religion, food and
disease has settled him. But there is still a way
whereby at least some traces may be retained. That
way is to collect all the piccaninnies as young as
possible and place them in settlement stations far
removed from the diseases and superstitions of the
camp and the pernicious influences of the old men,
so that they may be brought up in ignorance of the
ways of their fathers. No contact with outside blacks
should be allowed. The nippers should be taught the
ways of the white, man, and if well looked after and
disciplined and not allowed to marry out of their
race, they would produce a fine stamp of people in
a generation or two. Such a plan would probably
evolve a new. breed with but few of the characteristics
of the old-time Binghi, except in the color-scheme.
But they would at least be lineal descendants of
Australia’s unique aborigines, and, as such, would be
some sort of acquittal of the charge that our wonder-
ful capacity for letting things rip caused the entire
obliteration of the oldest and quaintest race of people
in the world. But we will have to get a move on,
for even in the far Outback the youngsters are
becoming fewer and fewer with startling rapidity.
Set a Thief to Catch an—Octopus.
When Henry VIII. summoned Kildare to
London to answer for sins which had in-
volved the laying waste of whole counties
and an attempt to burn an archbishop in
his own cathedral, the Court before which he
was tried declared that all Ireland could
not control this turbulent nobleman. “Then,”
said Henry, “the best thing is for the tur-
bulent nobleman to control all Ireland.” The
notion had a sporting chance of success; but
in Kildare’s case it didn’t work, and he
was soon back in London to answer for new
and bigger offences. Something of the same
sort has occurred in Australia. Labor six
or seven years ago got quite out of hand.
Big strikes that threatened to bring the
whole business of States and Commonwealth
to a standstill seemed quite beyond the little
statesmen then in power. Labor’s fashion
of holding up the country had in many cases
much to justify it; and as Labor was an
aspirant for political control, the electors
said that, since all Australia could not con-
trol this turbulent body, the best thing was
to let the turbulent body have a try at con-
trolling Australia. It has had its try, and
the result is that, whatever Labor’s facility
for controlling other things may be, it has
shown precious little skill in controlling
labor. All the talk about forming new
Labor parties which will get down to serious
work is therefore regarded with suspicion.
The question in the mind of the general pub-
lic is not whether all or any of these parties
can remove mountains, bridge oceans and do
other tremendous feats, but whether they
have the inclination to so discipline their
own conduct that Australia may get on with
her job and earn her keep. Kildare died in
the Tower of London before the headsman
could get busy. Whether Labor is to die or
live depends first and foremost upon its
ability to control the unruly labor which
downs tools 30 times a week, with the war-
wolf wffiining at the kitchen door.

Two weeks ago a waitress came for treatment
at Melbourne Hospital, after she had con-
sulted a Chow herbalist and swallowed a lot
of his prescription. She was put to bed,
treated for herbal poisoning, and sent home
as cured. But after her return home the
cured patient felt sicker than ever, so she
went back and wms then found to be suffer-
ing from meningitis. It is a disquieting
story. The wet-and-cold time for another
epidemic of this disease has come round
again; Australia’s diminished medical staff
is not quite sure about its early symptoms or
its why and wherefore ; and the scare which
was encouraged in the case of the bastard,
non-deadly smallpox is discouraged as
regards the disease that is 40 per cent, fatal
and about 30 per cent, wicked in its after-
effects. When the scare comes, as probably
it will, the proprietors of all places of
public haunt will discover that they have
been very neglectful of their business during
the warmer months. Their business was to
get definite medical statements as to the
measures which have been taken for restrict-
ing the liberties of the alleged “carrier” sub-
jects. A year ago the contagiousness of
meningitis was authoritatively denied. Then
it was stated that “contacts” were not neces-
sarily “carriers” and vice-versa. But no re-
assuring statements have been made as to
the arrangements made (if any) for catching
“carriers” ere they become “contacts,” and
safeguarding the public from infection, The
sweeping assertion that “meningitis has
always been with us” doesn’t touch the
point. The question is—Why is it so much
more with us than usual?

Farmer-parson Wood, president of the Vic-
torian Chamber of Agriculture, has officially
announced that that body has no connection
with either the Vic. Farmers’ Union or the
Farmers’ Union of Vic. The Chamber is
“purely non-political.” But, since Parson
Wood, for one, is a rabid platform advocate
of Liberal views and a persistent bomb-
thrower at party gatherings, while its mem-
bers are a fine old crusted lot of Liberal
barrackers, the attitude of the Chamber is
clear enough. All three concerns are directly
or indirectly occupied in pushing one parti-
cular party into Parliament, thus far with
entirely inadequate results. What Victoria
wants is a body of real farmers, of no particu-
lar political color, banded together to protect
the producing interests as best they can—for
instance, by chasing the robber-agent into
the criminal court, and by co-operation in
every direction where at present a middle-
man either supplies goods to the farmer or
handles the farmer’s output. With either a
Labor or a Liberal Administration in power,
immense strides towards a rural-producers’
millennium could be made in Victoria and
every other State by such an organisation.
As things are, the true issue is obscured by
the wild, dusty, frantic struggles of the poli-
tical farmer to reach Parliament and to pre-
vent his brother-clodhopper from doing like-
wise.

many jobs since I enlisted, and have met with men
of almost every trade and profession, all “doing
their bit” in their own line. Most of them were
properly recognised and provided for in the official
War Establishment. But not the trained man who
wields the setsquare and pencil. There are lieu-
tenants and sergeants whose specialty is handing out
tent-pegs, jam, bootlaces, shovels and toothbrushes.
Also, there are saddler-sergeants, armorer-sergeants,
farrier-sergeants, dispenser-sergeants and pack-store
sergeants (i.e., cloakroom attendants). The bloke
who digs drains and cesspits in the A.M.C. may be
a sanitary-sergeant. The man who polishes the
O.C.’s boots, and buttons his tunic, and makes him
wear clean, linen may be a corporal-batman. Like-
wise the gentleman who looks after the officers’ feed-
ing arrangements may enjoy N.C.O. rank and pay.
But unless he has earned promotion in one of the
units prior to attaining to his present job, the
draughtsman-specialist ranks with grooms and ser-
vants. The trained man whose profession visibly
expresses itself in accurate delineation of abstract
and material matters with the pen ranks in the mili-
tary mind as lower than the curator of biscuits,
wheelbarrows and grease. In Headquarters his work
may be of a most exacting, important and confiden-
tial nature, dealing with the publication of maps
and documents advising the daily disposition of
bodies of troops ; with roads, routes, water-schemes;
with placing of patrols, outposts, battalions and
artillery brigades and batteries and ammunition and
supply depots ; the ranges and areas to be covered by
the various weapons; weak spots to be specially
watched ; and the general details and plans of a cam-
paign of aggression or defence. Sometimes, as in
field sketching, it is a dangerous job. But despite all
that it is regarded as a gratuitous art-for-art-sake
stunt not even worth a sub-lieutenancy. However,
the War Establishment provides for sergeant-cooks ; so
my advice to men of my own profession is to forget
their life’s training, and straightway study the art
of scorching bull-meat and stewing water.
One thing which the war has driven home
is the certainty that a sprinkling of people
are not going to hold a continent the size of
Australia when huge populations elsewhere
want elbow room. No matter who is in-
jured, no matter who squeaks, this land
must be occupied, and every barrier and
hindrance to population must be removed.
Such a rich prize as Australia can never
bo safe till it is strong enough to defend
itself, and legislation must aim before all
things at giving it the right population. To
that end the incidence of taxation must be
shifted so that the married man who brings
up a large family will he let off lightly, in-
stead of being hit, as at present, with
shrapnel from every quarter, till his little
£5 per head bonus seems tragically insig-
nificant. Most vitally necessary first is the
transferring of a very large portion of the
incidence of taxation to land values, until
the holding of practically unused estates,
large or small, becomes a thing of the past.
Howls from those injured by such an altera-
tion are. of course, inevitable. But these
people have had a fair innings, and have
produced general stagnation and national
debility; and Australia is too large and valu-
able a heritage to endanger because of
howls, no matter how heartrending.

Objection to the closing of Cathedral-
street, Sydney, to make room for the com-
pletion of St. Mary’s Cathedra], came,
curiously, from the Parks Preservation
Society, which talked about “spoliation
of the great resort of the children in the
neighborhood.” As a matter of fact Cook
Park is easily the most untidy and least-
used recreation ground in Sydney, and the
upper corner of it, which will be “spoiled”
to make room for the proposed approach to
an architectural ornament, is a bare,
gravelly patch strewn with rotting fivs.
liven the perfect ladies who waylay
foot-passengers along Boomerang-street at
night disdain that portion of the
reserve. With the unsightly patch turned
into a well-kept frontage to a finished
cathedral some good might be made of the
balance, and a parks preservation crowd
that fails to see this ought to move on to a
job which requires no intelligence.

From the Father of One at Least:—
It seems too absurd to be correct, but so far as I
can find out nobody in Australia is making baby
shoes. The other day my dauntless wife attempted
to buy a pair for our small daughter, and failed
splendidly in six boot-shops, the keepers explaining
that the Australian manufacturer either can’t or
won’t make young Australia’s first footware.
The position seems to be something like
this: —•
The kid has to be shod.
The kid’s dad employs a foreign workman to make
the shoe.
There is a man who ought to be making the shoe
here; and because he isn’t making the shoe he is
idle.
To give him tucker the Government borrows
money and sets him to build some shops which other
men will presently be paid—also with borrowed
money—to pull down.
The borrowed money has to be paid back bv the
kid.
And the borrowing and the paying-back would both
be uncalled for if we had given the local man the
job of making the shoe instead of passing it on to
the foreign person, who will probably buy a gun
with the proceeds and shoot the kid when he grows
up.
Yet the kid is iiot to blame. He oughtn't to be
shot. It is “lifelong Freetraders” that needn’t be
mentioned just now who have earned the foreign
bullet.

Here is another sample of the vigor of the
Defence Department. Senator Pearce,
“after seeing the conditions,” has decided to
erect sheds for the men to have their meals
in at Liverpool (N.S.W.) camp. In July,
1915, Justice Rich, who had been appointed
a Royal Commission to inquire into the
grievances of the men at this camp, took
the trouble to live there, and upon thus see-
ing the conditions recommended the erection
of these shelter-sheds. After nine months of
discomfort, punctuated by a mutiny, the Min-
ister looks round casually and decides that
the thing shall be done. Now, consider how
the three parties have fared. (1) The
probably excellent soldiers who mutinied
have been given up to five years’
imprisonment. (2) The officers who
for nine months haven’t had the thing
done that the Minister, after a casual
inspection, says should be done straight
away, have in many cases been given
promotion. (3) The Minister who takes
nine months to do the thing that a Royal
Commission recommended, and which he now
sees should be done straight away, has also
been given promotion, being now acting-
Prime Minister.
In order to make things interesting for

Ode to Compromise.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A compromise has been euected. —Daily paper.
Oh, you of driest eyes,
Thin, naked, cold and wise,
Whose lips speak no surprise,
Yet still surprise us !
Your name beneath the skies
Is plain Jane Compromise;
And that your hands devise
From doubt unties us.
When the long wrangles rise,
And truth must war with lies,
Each fierce tongue-wagger tries
To compromise us.
And yet uncompromised w r e still remain.
For this above all else is clear and plain,
That you, O Compromise (whose name is
Jane),
Have still so nicely balanced loss and gain.
That faith is fair and honor knows no stain,
When that fine middle course which you
explain
Bakes, curries, boils and fries us!
Freedom is tall and blithe of face,
The eyes of Progress burn and glow,
Stern Truth, who scorns the market-place,
Has whitest robes that round her flow—
But you the Jane of all the Graces,
Put the whole bevy in their places!
A sword is good !
A pen is great!
Shall love be rude
To buttered hate?
Mix joy with tears
And soap with cream.
And wine with oysters.
Until the far horizon clears
And holy satyrs archly dream
Finance in wine-soaked cloisters!
Let snakes with happy children play
In merry weather!
Let the striped cat’s full roundelay
Mix with canary trills all day
Till fur and feather
Are one sweet song.
And let the happy burglar sit,
Twisting his noiseless cent rebit
In banks so strong
That the policeman’s guarded laughter
Recks not what rogues his boots are after,
But moves along,
Sure that the mad. bright world is wise
In. definite, clear Compromise.
Fine Knowledge goes in cap and gown,
Brave Wisdom walks in noiseless weeds ;
And Purpose, though the days be brown,
Wears a bright apron full of deeds—
But you, the Jane of all the Graces,
Put the whole bevy in their places!
As long as five from nine leaves four
This thing must be.
For Compromise, when talk is o’er.
Draws up her hope-hearse to the door,
And. waving free,
Its large, black plumes that shake and nod
Are as the voice of some dull god
To those who see,
As sequel to their toil and dreams,
A middle course ’twixt two extremes
The best to take.
From clear, cold truth subtract old lies.
Add on some falsehood fresh and new
And then divide the lot by two,
The net result is Compromise ;
And valor faints and vigor dies
In her black wake.
Pale Progress, marching all the day,
Takes one step on and two steps back;
And when the sun has passed away
The long night falls upon the track—
And every statesman starts anew
To prate of what he means to do.
Make no mistake ! This is no riddle.
The winning course is in the middle.
Let’s sit on both sides of the fence or
Wed our plain Jennie to the Censor;
For these conspire, as any ass may guess.
To still uphold the Freedom of the Press!

Sfte May “Triad”
The Trud for May, just issued, is just about as surprising and irrepressible as usual. There is
a lot of ordered criticism this month, and in and among it is much stuff of more general interest.
If the magazine issued a contents-bill, it would be something like this:—
Epistemon's Joke about the Germans
Plain Truths about Shakspere.
Literary Morals and the State.
Fred Hiscocks in Gallipoli.
On the Manufacture of Consciences.
The Actor in Journalism.
Obit: Sydney Athenaeum.
The Beach at Manly.—lll.
Verbrugghen and his C’onservatorium
A Poetess and her Love-afl'airs.
Will Lawson on Brisbane.
Mimi of Montmartre.
What’s the Matter with Frank Harvey?
The Martian, Australia, and a Girl.
Woman Proposes: Sidelights on Love.
Randolph Bedford Story about Religion.
Reginald Spencer-Browne, Brigadier-
General.
Art and the Fniversal-Provider.
A Little Candid Talk by Dorothy Brunton.
Granny “Herald”: An Appreciation.
Sydney’s Lady Painters.
This does very well for a rough suggestion: there are all sorts of other things—good music, good
pictures, good comment on this and that. It looks as if the Triad is sufficiently sane to resist all
temptations to become too respectable. It is more concerned with what people are than with what
people think. It has no apologetic smirks. It continues to make good its claim to be considered
IF STOMACH HT RTS DRINK HOT
WATER.
A SPECIALIST'S ADVICE.
“If dyspeptics, sufferers from flatulence,
indigestion, acidity, gastric catarrh, etc.,
would only take a quarter teaspoonful of
bisurated magnesia in half a glass of hot
water immediately after eating, they would
soon forget that they were ever afflicted with
stomach trouble, and doctors would have to
look elsewhere for patients.” In explanation
of these words the specialist stated that
most forms of stomach trouble were due to
acidity and fermentation of the food con-
tents, combined with insufficient blood sup-
ply to the stomach. Hot water increases
the blood supply, and bisurated magnesia
instantly neutralises the acid and stops food
fermentation; the combination of the two,
therefore, being very efficient and infinitely
preferable to the use of artificial digestives,
stimulants and medicines.— Advt.

to cross out the candidates he doesn’t want.
The natural result is that many electors
have a buzzing in the head, mark their
papers the wrong way, and have them
chucked out as informal. The just-finished
State election was the limit, so far, in this
direction, especially on the liquor poll. Of
the 75,921 ballot papers for the State 6104,
or 7.7 per cent., were rejected as informal.
The time seems nearly ripe for legislation
that will make things a bit more uniform.
Abdul Decorates General Muddle.
Berlin and Constantinople burst out into
flags last week, and not without reason.
Even if the surrender of the Anglo-Indian
army at Kut-el-Amara be of much less mili-
tary significance than the German repulse
before Verdun, it is still something over
which the Turk is entitled to fling his bat-
tered old fez into the air and give thanks
to Allah. And on the whole it looks as if
Allah is just as useful a joss as Party
Government. Anyhow, whether it be on
account of the local joss or the German boss,
the Turk is putting up a very respectable
resistance against assault. That the expedi-
tion against Baghdad was disgracefully
muddled doesn’t matter to the Turk and is
not going to impress his neighbors with a
sense of disaster to come. The sequence
of events thereabouts appears to be that an
inadequate force was despatched to do some-
thing, didn’t do it, and got into a hole.
Another force was sent to do the same thing
and pull the other out, but has either got
into a hole of its own or found one waiting
for it, and in any case hasn’t achieved what
it started out for. There are yarns
about floods and lack of aeroplanes
and a boat sticking in the river and
Turk —all of which means too much
Turk and too little of the other fellow.
And that is Gallipoli over again. What
Salonika is going to be remains to be seen ;
likewise several other things. Elsewhere along
the expansive Front, which is mainly down
in a cavern, the proceedings are given a
couple of lines occasionally, and from these
the conclusion is irresistible that there is
something more than 24 hours’ toil to be done
before the contract cuts out. The cheerful
officially-inspired lunatics who not long ago
gabbled about the enemy being in the last
ditch, and groping round for something to eat,
have not been heard from lately ; and as a
general measure of compulsion now seems
inevitable in Britain, there is at least reason-
able prospect of the job being tackled from
that side free from the numbing influences
which have distracted the nation’s attention
from the nation’s business and led to waste
of time, life and cash by futile talk about the
enemy’s business. The only safe way to
wage war is to throw in the maximum force
necessary for the undertaking in hand ; and
in this disturbance the central fact all along
has been that the opposition to be overcome
has vast strength, enormous resource, great
skill, high courage and well-ordered brains.
Failure to recognise this is merely calculated
to give encouragement to the foreign flag-
making industry.
From Fleet-street:—•
You fall over an Australian nowadays at any
London street corner, and some of them have plain
tales to raise your hair. I struck Lieutenant Leslie
Oswald Hatherly, R.N.R., of Newcastle (N.S.W.),
the other day up on leave from Lowestoft, where he
is stationed after a six months’ stretch of mine-
sweeping duty in the cold White Sea. He had just
been decorated by the Czar with the Order of St.
Stanislaus —a gorgeous golden star which hangs on
a crimson-and-white riband. Hatherly, who is
still in the thirties, is a square, thick-set chunk of
a sailorman. When the Czar gave Stanislaus to
Tommy Beecham for his services to Russian opera
the son of the Pills was the only Britisher who
had this decoration—the highest that can be bestowed
on any non-Russian person. The Newcastle man's
gaud is described officially as “with crossed swords,”
which seems to be an extra.
George Swinburne, one of the Inter-State
Commissioners, has been helping Treasurer
Higgs look into applications for permission
to float new cos. and increase the capital
of old ones; and there are few better men
in Australia for the job. But the work has
got beyond him. and a new officer is to be
appointed at £6OO a year.
“Ding Bat’s” story of Maoriland’s war-
economy :
At Puketutu a ganger and his men spent laborious
days erecting a new signal apparatus for the Gov-
ernment railways. So earnestly did they work that
they completed the job a day before it was officially
supposed to be finished. To still further save time
they pulled down the old signalling gear and then
sent word to the boss that the new gear was in
order and the old gear scrapped. Back came an
urgent telegram informing the ganger that as the
new gear was not to be worked till another day had
passed he would have to erect the old signal again.
It took him and nine men nearly all day to put the
old contraption up again, and the same time was
occupied taking it down next day. Meanwhile the
new and perfectly-ready signal stayed idle and the
wages of the gang amounted to £l2 6s.

“The Sensation of the Hour,” says the
J.C.W. advt., is “So Long, Letty,” at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s; and the statement is not
a criminal libel on local feeling. The hybrid
entertainment has got Melbourne by the ear.
“Letty” is a sensation. Not a very glorious
or elevating or awakening sensation. Not
the sort of sensation to advance the cause of
conscription and stimulate slackers to go in
and win the war lest their sisters should
presently be shaking in their cloth-topped
shoes. But a pleasant sensation, like one
gets from being tickled by a young person of
the opposite sex when the evening sun is low.
“Letty” is sufficiently suggestive, though not
too shocking. It draws the vague line at the
misty margin of impropriety. It points a
moral which has no morals to speak of, and
it adorns a stage. The setting and the
dresses, and the girls within them, are a
charming combination of form and color. The
show has the effect of light refreshment to
the heart of man and flattering unction to
the soul of woman —especially if she’s one of
the married sort. For the two discontented,
unconvincing husbands have no sooner
swapped wives than they begin to repent
their faithlessness, whereas the wives are
busily and beautifully engaged in solving the
mystery of how to remain faithful though
swapped. The final inference is that the
remarkable virtue of the temporarily mis-
placed ladies has won its own reward, plus
a week’s interest, whereas the sin of the hus-
bands has found them out. As for the three
or four dozen girls who are not married,
their character is always above suspicion.
They mostly flock together and revel in the
simple joy of life. Their gaiety has a sweet
appearance of not being assumed for a
weekly wage. The light of Heaven shines
from their glad eyes and their legs sing in
chorus. Also, the grace of Daisy Yates the
Fox Trotter, is a haunting memory and a bit
of orlright.
If only for Allan Wilkie’s Shylock, “The
Merchant of Venice” earned this paper’s

that “The Midnight Mail” had closed its

“Mother Goose,” having stormed and taken
the position, has entrenched herself at Her

to turn her out again. That ancient enemy
of all pantos will launch a successful attack
some night in the dim future; whereupon the
shapely garrison will merely retire in good
order to a new position in another theatre.
But for the present, the army having only
just arrived in its present quarters, all is
gaiety, and the forgotten pursuer is plodding
along somewhere over the horizon.

Coldly considered, “The Boomerang" is a
pretentious triviality, saved from failure by
the American manner of Donald Bowles.
Hale Hamilton and Miss Tannehill. The
plot is remarkably lacking in stuff. The cur-
tain sometimes rises at 8.20 in order to keep
things going till 10.40. Two long waits
between acts are aided and abetted by several
blank spaces of silence whilst the curtain is
up aud the play is standing still. But it has
two or three real good moments. When
Bowles, as the oldest-fashioned youth
on record, hysterically tells his love
to the doctor, he touches a top-note
of realism. Bowles is an admirable
“mother’s-boy” throughout—as convincing
as his face will let him be. Ham-
ilton, too, is a hearty, easy exponent of the
only sort of doctor who could possibly do as
this doctor does. And Miss Tannehill is just
gentle as falling dew and sweet as maple
syrup. The character calls for something
more than human angelicism, and Miss
Tannehill produces it. If any girl with a
Yankee accent could ecstatically decline to
go and be the long-lost heiress of a multi-
millionaire because she would rather stay
and dote on Hale Hamilton —well, Miss
Tannehill is the some girl in question. On
the other hand, there is no ground for sup-
posing that Celia Ghiloni (Mrs. Wood-
bridge) could at once flood a doctor’s empty
waiting-rooms with admiring patients merely
by recommending her personal friends to him.
Miss Ghiloni strikes one as being the last
woman in the world to have an enormous
circle of sick acquaintances.

needs a lot of gun and ginger in its composi-
tion. Moreover, it demands vigorous sup-
port from the cow-punching and kyard-plav-
ing sections of the c-o. Besides Guy HesV
ings, Miss Gleeson (the squaw) and Bryant
(the terrific Cash Hawkins), there are some
good performers in the motley gathering at
the King’s. Jeff Williams makes a live
character of Big Bill, the foreman of the
ranch. When he and Hastings squat down
to pow-wow with John Lennon, the Indian,
.and a bloke who translates Lennon's weird
noises into English, the quartet is positively
impressive. Fred McDonald, Harford anil
Bertrom figure prominently among the breth-
ren who wear sheepskin facings to their
pants, and Frank Cullinane is the Sheriff
who troubles them for a sniff of their guns.
Cullinane comes in useful at the finish by
calling everybody together on account of the
death of Cash Hawkins six years previously.
The strange thing was that nobody took the
trouble to make sure of the Bad Man's
decease at the time. When he was found
lying on the beer-stained floor, face down
wards, nobody even turned him over to see
whether he wasn’t more drunk than dead.
The Bct.letix has never felt sure as to who
killed Cash Hawkins. Perhaps his funeral
killed him. The careless Sheriff may have
popped the fallen body into a hasty grave
and buried it alive on suspicion.
"Hindle Wakes,” which is being played
so well at the Little Theatre (Sydney), makes
way for ‘‘The Critic.” The latter is from the
brain of Brinsley Sheridan, who has been
heard of as the author of a comedy called
"The School for Scandal.”

fields and cowbells in the dusk, when the

the other performers he adopts a softer key;
but he never comes out and flatly denounces
a turn. And really there isn’t much need to at
the moment. The well-manned bill is practi-
cally the same as last week. Mennetti and

quite distinct from ordinary flannel.
Flannel Shirtings, however good, have hitherto been visually
too pronounced in color-effects for business wear. The
Angola Shirts come in three subdued shades —a Grey, a
Green, and a Blue —the only design being a small pin-head
effect woven in the same color. Angola wool is a soft,
fleecy flannel, smooth to the touch, and gives warmth without
weight. Early contracting has enabled us to quote last
season’s price .... 14/6 each, Ready to Wear

Barring the reappearance of Sterling and
Love, the animated musicians, and Nelson
and Nelson, the eccentrics on stilts, there is
nothing startling to disclose about Melbourne
Bijou. Madge Maitland has changed her
programme somewhat since The Bulletin
last saw her, but in the main she is the
same brisk comedienne, and still continues
to draw pointed attention to her nose by
studying its image in a looking-glass. Ap-
parently the lady’s antics in the matter are
intended to show that if other people had
their noses thrust upon them, her particular
organ reflects her own good taste.
The Ideals remain at Melbourne Audi-
torium. The programme was changed on
Saturday and the proceedings sounded like a
thanksgiving service for the invention .»f rag-
time. There w r as altogether too much of
this jumpy interruption. The orchestra
ragged ivith great exuberance, and even
Ivanoff’s violin broke out in a syncopated
snigger, so to speak. Also pianist Dennett
got the band to join him in a ragtime con-
certo. The pretentious eft'usb n was com-
posed by Dennett and comedian Jack Waller,
and to The Bulletin it suggested that the
two had fallen out about something.
A five-part thrill entitled “Pennington’s
Choice" is having a week’s run at Hoyt’s
Theatres, Melbourne. The story is unfolded
in Canadian scenery and is especially inter-
esting for the fact that an ex-champion pug.
J. J. Jeffries, gives body to the plot, while
two cinema stars, Francis X. Bushman and
Miss Beverly Bayne, supply the necessary
soul. The other feature is named “The
Heart of Blue Ridge,” and is a love story
wherein Clara Kimball Young is the cause
of protrated strife between a flyweight hero
and an illicit whisky distiller in the heavy
division. This paper doesn’t know why
there should be all this fuss over Clara, but
anyhow the tanglefooter gets the worst of
the argument. When he attempts to end
the discussion on the edge of a gulch, he is
given such a good, hard push by the curate-
like hero that a fork is required to collect
his remains.
Comic opera reigns at Adelaide Royal,
alternating Avith modern musical-comedy.
Leslie Holland is quaint and delightful, and
of the newcomers Minnie Love, graceful and
humorous, makes the biggest impression. But
“The Dancing Mistress” is very ordinary of
its kind. Florence Young came into the
cast to play lead in “Paul Jones,” and now’
“Miss Gibbs” is giving general satisfaction.
In Tivoli melodrama, Brandon Cremer, aa’lio
usually does comic work, has given a fine
performance as the cripple in “The Two
Orphans.” Wheeler, the musical tramp, is
at the King’s; and the programme has
roused up greatly with the athletic turns of
Charlbert and Essie and the Astelles. The
jolly Dandies are working, through Avretched
outdoor weather, to the end of their summer
season ; and Cawthorne, at the Queen’s, has
started “Saturday pops,” with Clara Sefrcna
and the other abounding local talent. The
finest pictures in sight are the “Britain Pre-
pared” lot. doing enormous business at the
Town Hall. West’s, Wondergraph and Pav.
find the Oakbauk Steeplechase go as w 7 ell as
any drama ; and the Empire makes a bold
bid with a “Stiugaree” bushranging story,
and an ingenious Sydney-Emden naval-battle
affair.

AT POVERTY POINT.
Exit from his place as a teacher of the
violin in Adelaide University, and also from
the musical profession in general, Heinrich
Heinieke. The students who made a riotous
demonstration against him at the beginning
of the war admitted afterwards that they
acted on misinformation; but he looks like
a German and speaks like a German, and
only the good Lord knows what he thinks
like. The University Council has thanked
him for his 18 years of service, and he won’t
starve because he quits it. He married one
of the Gebhardt girls—daughters of a Ger-
man who squatted in the North and scraped
together a lot of money.
“Norbell”: Apropos recent slighting
references to the Dampier bellow, “Robbery
Under Arms.” It was the fine old star’s
personality that made it the big hit it cer-
tainly was 20 years ago. I played in it
then with him, and he had other good actors
in the • cast —Fred Appleton, Locky
McGowan, Charles Field, Ned Holloway,
and, in addition to daughters Lily and Rose
and Mrs. Dampier 1 , a fine actress in Julia
Merton, also dead, alas! “Robbery” was
popular everywhere in those days. We

played it in Melbourne and Sydney as a
“great production,” and we perpetrated it
at Shypoo when stage, auditorium, every-
thing, was lit by one smoky kerosene lamp.
The play came in for adverse criticism even
then. At Sozzlebong I overheard the land-
lord at our pub commenting on the show to
a barful of wire-whiskers. “Robbery
Under Ar-r-ms!” he said bitterly. “It’d
bin more dacent f’r these dom bushrangers
to bail up th’ people in th’ sthreet, instid av
kiddin’ ’em inter th’ Mechanics’ t’ do it!”
“Private Boxer”: George Marlow is the
only Australian manager doing his little bit
for the Shakspeare tei’centenary in this
continent. Excluding the Adelphi (Syd-
ney); all the principal theatres of the Com-
monwealth are given over to the production
of plays made in America. (I except the
pantomimes, which are not made any-
where.) Even the home-grown Bert Bailey
firm has gone to the Yankee. Hinc illae
lachrymal, which being interpreted is “There
is something rotten in the state of Den-
mark.”
“H. 0.”: “S.S.” (B. 20/4/T6) complains
of short-weight drama and of the supersti-
tion among local managers that the public
does not like curtain-raisers. What is this
superstition based on? We have had but
few curtain-raisers of recent years, and none
of them has spelt disaster that I know of.
When “An Englishman’s Home” failed to
win support from a public that regarded
the German menace as plain bunkum, a cur-
tain-raiser, “After the Opera,” was added,
and although it could not save the situation,
it mitigated it. “Dolly’s Little Bills,” the
deplorable Henry Arthur Jones playlet that
accompanied “Lady Frederick,” did not pre-
vent the latter being the biggest success of
Ethel Irving’s Melbourne season, and “A
Marriage of Convenience” was one of the
Lewis Waller productions that did boom,
despite the fact that it was preceded by a
truly awful example of what a curtain-raiser
should not be. When even bad curtain-
raisers do not kill a show, what is
the objection to them? They offer,
on the other hand, an opportunity to
managements to do something practical
for loqal dramatists at no great
risk to themselves. Well acted, Louis
Esson’s “Dead Timber,” for example, could
scarcely fail to impress even a theatrical
public fed on the unrealities of Yankee
drama and the banalities of Yankee farce.
Actress Ternpe Piggot, who has made a hit
in Frederick Ward’s present production at
the Little Theatre, is off to U.S.A. on the
10th of May. In spite of local protests, the
Queenslander decided that prophets still get
better attention from the ravens of foreign
countries than they do from their own.
“Masetto” : The Melbourne Philharmonic’s
recent performance of “Elijah” brings to
mind its first showing here in 1857. In the
name part Farquharson appeared the first
half-dozen times; and T. H. Rainford, the
nigger minstrel, showed he could do heavy
work as well. Visiting baritones who have
been heard are Santley (whose voice was
waning when Australia heard him),
Magrath (who returned with the Quinlan
Opera 20 years after), Douglas Powell, Wil-
liam Powell, W. A. Peterkin, Watkin Mills,
Kennerley Rumford and Andrew Black.
Amongst tenor soloists have been two
Italians, Castelli and Rosneti, the latter
causing some amusement with his pronun-
ciation. Henry Hallam, who was last heard
in Melbourne in “The Fortune Teller” 12
years ago, saug in 1870. Recently-dead
Knight Aston had a go at the part in ’B3,
and the heroic-voiced Chai’les Turner a
couple of years before that. Armes Beau-
mont’s eight appearances run over the time
from 1871 to 1897. The Carandini family
loom large among the female soloists, Rosina
(Mrs. Palmer) having the chief soprano part
no less than nine times. The greatest num-
ber of alto appearances was scored by
Madame Christian with six. Other famous
altos called to memory are Mrs. Cutter,
Marian Burton, Belle Cole, and in times
that the youngsters can remember Ada
Crossley and Clara Butt.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : I don’t remem-
ber the alleged panto, incident of a Dick
Whittington team of cats (B. 27/4/T6),
but something akin happened in ’54 or ’55
when Tom Barry, a famous English circus
clown, sailed on the Yarra in a tub drawn
by half a dozen geese. Barry came out for
the benefit of his health, but didn’t stay
long, and died soon after his return to Eng-
land.
During the Williamson incursion into
“pictures” at the Adelaide Royal there
was the story of a girl who walked
in snaky places. Apparently she had
faith in some antidote, but on one occa-
sion—so ran the narrative furnished by
the management—she was in danger, having
nothing on her to repel the attacks of ser-
pents. As soon as this brief abstract was
made public, the Authorities called upon the
manager in an awful voice, to explain just
what he was going to give the public. They
understood, they said, that the film was
going to show a lady walking about in
snake-infested country with nothing on her!
When the simple facts were explained and
a trial-trip of the film offered, all was well,
and the picture had a successful week’s run.
“First Old Man”: Pass the theatrical
V.C. to Rosa Stahl, an American actress
who recently refused to be the heroine in a
new play on the ground that she Avas “too
old for the part.” Up to now 1 always
believed no actress was too old for anything
but death.
“Yarra Ben’’: Reg Wykeham. has done
many good things on the Australian boards,
but he never looked a part better than on
Anzac Day in Melbourne. In company with
Corporal George Castles (brother of Amy)
and Driver Chisholm —-both late of the
Royal—Private Wykeham bossed an al fresco
concert given on an elegantly-appointed
Army Service waggon drawn by eight horses
and with four mounted drivers. Altogether
it was the best matinee show I ever attended,
and the mummers on Poverty Point all
agreed with me.
He is a melodious young man, plump, a
celebrity in one metropolis, and he is usually
accompanied by an effusive bodyguard of
doting dames. The other day the warbler
was taking afternoon tea in a city resort in
the bosom of his bunch, when in a struggle
with a piece of cake he pricked his finger
with a fork. The red blood flowed into one
vivid spot, and commotion fell upon the
lowing herd. Women of uncertain age
squealed, gurgled and offered shrill advice.
The singer brushed them aside and held
aloft his punctured digit. “For Heaven’s
sake, ladies, don’t stand squeaking there,’’
he wailed. “Run —run for assistance !”
“Cleido”: The Johnson-Willard pictures
were running a two-night season. An abo.
first-nighter, though disappointed at the
result, was one of the first in attendance at
the final performance. This fact moved the
entrepreneur to inquire of the darky the
reason of his second helping. “Fine pfeller
fight last night,” Jacky told him. “White
man plurry lucky he won. Mine tinkit
black pfeller win dis time.” So he had
come along to see black brudder regain the
championship.
“Stargazer”: I think “So Long, Letty,”
provides one of the rawest ballets I have
ever seen. The regiments of girls march
down in skirts something the color of fresh
steak, and doing a sudden right-about dis-
close the fact that their frocks are scooped
away to the waist line, exposing an enor-
mous sweep of bare back. When the
flock massed, and then spread into three
raw rows in horseshoe formation, recollec-
tion stirred in me, and I wondered. Where
had I seen that same formation and the
same stark spread ? Eureka! It was a
marvellous representation of a popular and
prosperous Bourke-street butcher’s shop on
a Friday evening.
Cheerful cable from Wellington (M.L.) :
During the past year the British Government has
paid the Maoriland Government £9,500,000, princi-
pally for meat.
But it wasn’t mentioned that during the same
period Massey had borrowed £6,000,000 from
the same address. The political economy of
the M.L. Cohelition seems to be to sell John
Bull chops and steaks for spot cash and then
borrow from the old man enough to send
a few tens of thousands of people to help
him eat them.
The South Aus. Government is going to
spar for time in the much-discussed appoint-
ments of Railways Commissioner and
Chief of Police. Both Moncrieff and Ray-
mond pass out next month, but each will get
a year’s leave, during which an acting-com-
missioner will be appointed to each office.
Presumably much will depend on how the
new men shape, for it is officially announced
that they will “not necessarily’’ get the
jobs.
The Red Cross Information Bureau, 168
Pitt-street, Sydney, will obtain news of
absent soldiers for any inquirer. The
Bureau is in touch with every military
hospital, and can avail itself of the help of
all British Red Cross Societies in order to
get definite news of sick, wounded or miss-
ing soldiers, or where the graves of the dead
are situated. The Bureau makes no charge
for its services; but those who can afford
to pay for cables at 7s. 6d. each are expected
to do so.
Passed out at North Sydney, Charles
Mark Palmer, in the 87th lap. Born at
Brighton (Eng.) he was articled to a soli-
citor, but dropped Costs to go to sea, and
was a shipmate of Huxley, the scientist,
when the latter was surgeon of the survey
sloop Rattlesnake. Palmer took part in
some exciting hunts after slavers in West
Africa, but finding that glory brought little
cash with it, he left the Navy and came to
Australia in 1859. Joining the Bank of
N.S.W. he eventually became its secretary.
W. H. Palmer, official assignee in bank-
ruptcy, is a son.
Something better must be done by Aus-
tralia in the direction of a Warriors’ Com-
pensation Act. Speaking recently as a
deputationist to Treasurer Higgs, Bert Cook,
president of the Journalists’ Association,
cited the case of a clerk who had been
awarded a single shilling per week for the
loss of his right thumb and forefinger.
There is a Pension Board, and the fault may
lie in the administration. The first obvious
step is to let the light of day into its pro-
ceedings. Otherwise the people will never
know whether reform is needed or not.

How I Darkened My
Grey Hair.
Lady gives Simple Home Recipe That
She Used to Darken Her Grey Hair.
For years I tried to restore my grey hair
to its natural color with the prepared dyes
and stains, but none of them gave satisfac-
tion and they were all expensive. I finally
came across a simple recipe which I mixed
at home that gives wonderful results. I
gave the recipe, which is as follows, to a
number of my friends, and they are all
delighted with it. To 7oz. of water add a
small box of Orlex Compound, loz. of bay
rum and ioz. of glycerine. These ingredients
can be bought at ,any chemist’s at very little
cost. Use every other day until the hair
becomes the required shade, then every two
weeks. It will not only uarken the grey
hair, but removes dandruff and scalp humors
and acts as a tonic to the hair. It is not
sticky or greasy, does not rub off, and does
not color the scalp.— Advt. [5

The sermon was over, the holy man had
proclaimed an armistice, and the official tax-
gatherer stole up the central communication
trench. Billjim, dreaming of Gallipoli, didn’t
notice he was enfiladed until the silver-strewn
plate was shoved under his nose. He had
no ammunition on him. Looking up appeal-
ingly at the hovering collector he whisp-
ered “Kitchener !” And the plate went on.
“Scaremonger”: These quiet, decorous
suburban ladies who graciously accept the
seats we give up to them in crowded trams
fairly eat the insane rumors that grow up
in the shadow of our grandmotherly censor-
ship. My wife, who keeps me informed on
current suburban chatter, has amazed me
by innocently passing on some of the dread-
ful yarns she has been forced to listen to in
small drawing-rooms full of nice, respectable
neighbors. They are the sort of foolish libels
that could be killed dead with a little day-
light, but which flourish like nightmares in
the official darkness that has been forced
upon the press. As the anonymous authors
of various Liberal legends know, the genteel
suburbs are extraordinarily credulous and
willing to believe anything that is pumped
into them. The sort of things they believed
about the Labor party simply don’t matter
alongside the gossip they mistake for gospel
concerning their own fine armies and nurses,
and a hundred other things of national im-
portance. I don’t know where these libels
spring from; but I am quite sure they
wouldn’t spring at all if the Censor forgot
to come down to his office for a few days.
Desert fighting as Jack Sommers, an Aus-
tralian artist, sees it: —
The Mediterranean to-day is the reflection of the
halcyon’s wing, an arrangement of iridescent gieens
and purples ; the ferewater a flicker of living green
marble veined with pale gold ; at my feet the fallen
pillars of an old Roman villa.
If you will look at an ancient map you will see
that this place is marked “Lotophagi,” and the
legend of the lotos-eaters seems well understood on
such a day as this. Half a mile to sea little golden
islets jut from the malachite shallows. To the
left a dainty cream-colored mosque lifts its beautiful
minaret. “A savage place, but holy and enchanted.”
Look again. A grim line of sangars castellated
with sandbags and enmeshed in barbed wire stretches
from the beach; grim, long-snouted guns, fr-un
which one breath would dispel all the fairies in dis-
may, poke their noses to the sky ; sinister warships
cluster at the little landing place, while dim
columns of troops creep across the sand.
Pan is dead and Mars triumphant!
Birshola, the latest and biggest fight in these
parts, came and went in a welter of mud, rain and
gore. Here we met for the first time the regular
troops of the Sidi Armed, the rebel Senussi chief—
quite a different proposition from the white-shawled
snipers we have tackled before. After terrific diffi-
culties in roads of fiendish tenacity an engagement
occurred on the open desert plain eight miles to the
west of Birshola. Of the action from centre to left
I can speak, as I traversed that Front during the
fight and had the pleasure of assisting at the pep-
pering of the enemy’s attempt to turn our left. It
was like a fight in a dream, fought through lakes of
shifting mirage by distorted phantoms.
The enemy, at times visible in great numbers,
seemed to appear on the skyline out of silvery lakes.
Moving doggedly and slowly, in well-disciplined and
extended order, they maintained a fire from mausers
which inflicted considerable loss to our held horses
and supports; the high double crack of their mauser
rifles punctuated by the heavier boom of their heavy
bores. Towards sunset they faded away to the west
and south. My pal and I, I think, fired the last
shots on the extreme left, where we made sure of a
straggler just at dusk.
After that, the return of the column: stretcher-
bearers carrying our wounded shoulder-high; mule
ambulances; tall camels swinging along with
wounded sikhs, one on each chair —-red-blanketed;
patterns of fortitude in their seats of torment. A
Ghurka ambulance with the bad cases on wire mat-
tresses ; G.S. waggons with stretchers across the
rail; footsore stragglers, plunging through the soft
soil towards Matruh, weary, aching, but victorious. At
the beginning of the good road the motor-ambulances
whirled the worst cases off to where the hospital
ship with shining Red Cross .lay in the little bay of
Mersa Matruh.
Below the sangars on the hill the white crosses
on the little patch of green, “lighting the desert’s
dusty face,” have of late sadly increased. Kismet!
But I am still spared to write of the beauties of
this world, to feel the kiss of the winter sun, the
BREVITY IS THE SOUL OF WIT.

caress of the soft sea wind. Yet for me there is no
lotos of forgetfulness; my heart is far away where
the breeze, wattle-scented, blows through the beloved
bush of Home; through whose aisles we may once
more walk, when the roar of battle having died
down, we shall understand, in a new world, with a
new’ understanding.
A QUESTION OF STATLS.
GWENDOLYN: “Oh, Captain Platter, arc you a hero yet, or are you only going to he?”
Apropos “lost money” they tell a wicked
tale in the public-office lobbies. An agent
brought along his little bit of business, and
when he had explained it to the clerk-in-
charge casually produced a box of cigars.
“Mr. Smith, you mustn’t offer me anything
like that, you know —it is most improper,
most improper]” “Oh, my dear sir, you
misunderstand me,” said Smith. “I wasn’t
proposing to give you the cigars. It’s a
line I am selling.” “Ah, that’s a different
matter, quite a different matter. How
much?” “Two shillings the box of 50.”
“Very well, Mr. Smith; please bring me
three boxes.”

“C.J.L.”: The little bit of Gallipoli that

Amidst it all, death screaming everywhere,
two Jimbill pals grabbed one another and

dent of the A.W.N.L. This time her excuse
for coming forward is in defence of the
sanctity of the National Anthem, whi.h the
Education Department of Victoria has been
defiling with a verse asking the Almighty to
bless the Australian soldier. “Surely,'’ urges
Eva, out of a full heart, or something,
“verses cannot be added to our National
Anthem in this manner unless authorised by
the King and Parliament.” Lord, no!
Though if it were put up to the King, who’s
a decent fellow, he’d probably explain that
lie was dashed proud to be prayed for in
such company.

OUR DAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We wake, who idly slumbered,
To stoim and tempest-blast;
Our childhood’s hours are numbered,
And we are men at last;
The years wherein we slumbered
Are gathered to the past.
Till song and story perish,
And power and pomp and State,
Some day all nations cherish,
Some hour commemorate,
When paltry memories perish
Before the good and great.
What time we found the laurel
We found the cypress, too ;
We quickened to the quarrel,
And proved our manhood true;
Oh, glorious is our laurel,
Though red with sacred dew!
What day shall we remember
IVhen war has passed away —
Some gold day in December,
Some June day, cold and grey ?
Not these! We shall remember
Our laurelled April day !
When war’s red season closes,
And wounded earth grows well,
Then shall we wreathe with ro?es
The graves of those who fell —
Each grave, when war’s reign closes,
With rose and immortelle.
If thus they be regarded
To whom great Death was kind,
How shall they be rewarded —
The maimed, the sick, the blir.d ?
Shall they go unregarded,
No hearth-of-eomfort find?
Chimed out from tower and steeple
Dishonored were our pride
If we, a favored people,
High Duty's call denied.
Nay, nay ! From tower and steeple
That duty must be cried 1
No word shall dull the story,
Though dimmed it be with tears,
Of those who gathered glory,
Triumphant o’er their fears,
To make their nation’s story
Renowned through the years.
What day shall we remember
When war has passed away ?
Some gold day in December,
Some June day, cold and grey?
Not these! We shall remember
Our laurelled April day !

IF CONSTIPATED TAKE
CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Delicious “regulator” for stomach, liver
and bowels, for mamma, daddy,
and children.
If you are headachy, constipated, bilious,
or if the stomach is disordered and you want
to enjoy the nicest liver and bowel cleansing
you ever experienced, take a tablespoonful of
California Syrup of Figs—“Califig”— to-
night, and in the morning all the constipa-
tion poison, bile and clogged-up waste will
gently move out of the system without grip-
ing, and you will feel splendid.
Every member of the family should use
this fruit laxative as occasion demands. It
is just as effective for grandpa as it is for
baby. It simply cannot injure. Even cross,
sick, feverish children just love its pleasant
taste, and mothers can rest easy after givin
it because it never fails to effect a goo
“inside cleansing.”
For 30 years California Syrup of Figs—
“Calilig”—has been recommended by physi-
cians as the ideal stomach, liver and bowel
cleanser. Millions of families who are well
informed use nothing else.
Ask your chemist for a bottle of “Califig”
—California Syrup of Figs—which has full
directions for babies, children of all ages and
for grown-ups plainly printed on the bottle.
Get the genuine, made by the California
Fig Syrup Company. Refuse any other kind
with contempt. “Calilig”—California Syrup
of Figs—is sold by all ehenrsts in bottle
of two sizes, Is. lid. and Is. 9d. [3
From the week’s N. S. Wales “Court”
news: —■
By his Excellency, the Governor’s invitation, Sir
Rider Haggard met, at Government House, on
Thursday, the representatives of the Trades Unions
and Political Labor Leagues, who were afterwards
entertained at tea by Lady Edeline Strickland.
Presently, when someone asks why Labor
hasn’t abolished State Governors, as pro-
mised, it will no doubt be explained that
the Governor is a valuable link between the
divergent chains of political thought.

“Mr. Piedish”: After wandering round our
Agricultural Show, I don’t think I’d care for
a baronetcy or anything of that sort, thanks.
If I chanced to be “created” (I think that is
the right word) Lord Piedish I’m sure most
of my countrymen would think I was a prize
bull. Nearly all the baronets and dukes in
Australia wear rings through their noses and
munch hay.

Last week, in Sydney, a mere Australian
was fined £3, with £1 4s. costs, for working
a horse in an unfit condition. The same day
a haughty German was lined up. He was
a boarder at a hash-factory, and, being
annoyed by a woman who remarked at the
tea-table that all single men should be at
the Front, he put her and her baby out
of the house. When a police constable
arrived to make inquiries the Hun bashed
him good and hard, and with the aid of his
(the Hun’s) wife hurled John off the veran-
dah. The enraged Beak said that it was a
“contemptible and cowardly thing to turn a
woman and her baby out of a house at
night,” and that the German’s assault on the
Law’s emissary was also “cowardly.” Then
his Worship smote his Doomsday Book with
a goose quill and sentenced the charming son
of Ivultur to pay a whole £3. No wonder
the joke about “the fatheaded English” is the
joy of Berlin.
SCOTTISH THEOLOGY UP-TO-DATE.
MOGGIE: “Do you no hen Gowd sees you?”
DONAL (undeterred): “I'm no carin’.
Gowd’ll no tell.”
THE COHENS’ NIGHT OUT.
HE: “How the week has flown! I can scarcely believe this is Saturday night.”
SHE: “Well, it is. But if you have any doubts, look at the audience.”
“Father of Two” : For several weeks now
I’ve been publicly clamoring in our most
respectable daily at 2s. 6d. a yell for some
female —any sort of female —to come and
relieve the wife and myself at the washing-
up tin, and enjoy a comfortable home, and
have almost every night out, and be treated
as a lady, and take 15s. a week for doing it.
The response couldn’t have been fainter if
I had been asking for someone to come and
be chained in a rat-
haunted cellar. Now,
I am sure there are
hundreds and thou-
sands of homes where
small change is scarce
and discontented
daughters of over-
school age frequent.
I refuse to believe that
the domestic world
has been completely
freed from the idle,
ambitious type of
flapper who puts in
her days telling her
harassed mother that
she hasn’t a rag to
her back and threaten-
ing to enlist in the
perilous panto, chorus
if dad can’t dress her
better. What this bud
needs is honest work
-—she needs it almost
as badly as her
parents need rest from
her foolish young
sneers. I see conscrip-
tion of wealth is pro-
posed. Well, I’m going
to start a campaign
in favor of a conscrip-
tion whereby those
vastly - important
people, the young
mothers, may be freed
from less important
jobs to give more care
to the upbringing of
their children. Inci-
dentally the mothers
of the. risen generation
will be relieved of
the burden of clothes,
shelter and entertain-
ment thrown upon
them by the able-bodied family idlers. If
some ignorant and argumentative person
dares to tell me that the species is extinct
I will guarantee to take a wire-trap of live
rats down any suburban street and scare
one out of every third house.
“Mariner”: What most struck Brewis, the
expert imported by the Federal Government
to report on coast lighting, was the total
absence of the “unwatched” light. His
remarks on the subject have shaken up the
department, and a big change starts at
Nobbys, Newcastle (N.S.W.). For 35 years
this light, a simple oil lamp, has required
three keepers, at a cost in salaries of £7OO
a year, with three cottages to maintain. In
its place a flashing acetylene high-power
light which minds its own business is to be
installed. Somebody will find tiipe once a
quarter or so to go and tickle up the appar-
atus, and efficiency is guaranteed. Nobbys
in salaries alone must have cost N. S.
Wales £20,000. Of course the miwatched
light is modern, but it is old enough to have
been in use sufficiently long to have made a
great saving. Probably that was what blew
it out.
“Elwood” : There is an idea that we are
a nation of lunatics, so indifferent to Arma-
geddon that we seek the bubble of pleasure
even in the cannon’s mouth, while the Ger-
man thinks of nothing but how best to win
the war. I’m not saying that we are any
more serious than we ought to be ; but here
are extracts from three German papers
which suggest that, anyway, Hans and
Gretchen are no better than Bill and Mary.
Says the Berlin Keuzzeitung :
The people are living a life of such repulsive
immorality and indecency, so shameless in its open
ostentation and depravity, that soldiers returning
home turn their heads away in horror, and ask them-
selves why they should sacrifice their lives for such
a people. Did these heroes know more of the secret
of what is really going on they would see that, dark
as the picture is on the surface, it is far blacker
underneath.
Dilating on what it calls the “abandoned
immorality” of the Hun civil population
the Deutsche Tageszeitung remarks:—
The divorce courts are busy, and nearly all the
cases involve wives of soldiers. It is a quite
common occurrence for a young soldier to return
from the battle-line to find his wife carrying on a
liaison with another man.... Plays are being pro-
duced so nauseating in their depravity and lascivi-
ousness that they may well fill our soldiers, purified
in the fire of war, with disgust at this decay of
the national morals.
And even the semi-official Berliner Tage-
blatt confesses that it is shocked, observing:
News of murders of the most revolting description
reaches us from all parts of the Empire. Convic-
tions for all kinds of swindling operations occur
daily.
When being invited to contemplate our own
shortcomings there is some satisfaction in
knowing that the Hun garden isn’t all sweet
mignonette either.
“/Esculapius”: On account of recruiting
officers being instructed to block medical
students who have passed their first_?ear,
together with the fact that in 1915 the
Faculty permitted men to walk right into
the second year, there has lately been a
young invasion of Melbourne University.
This sudden swamping of the professional
boat was the subject of grave consideration
by the members of its crew, and by that
patriotic little body, the Medical Students'
Society. The result was that last week
the Faculty filled up all loopholes of escape
from universal service by acidifying and
precipitating all the concessions from the
curriculum, to the intense annoyance of
many selfish fathers and doting mothers who
thought they had at one stroke saved their
own dear boys from “this horrible war” and
secured them a whole year’s start in a good
profession.

On Anzac Day every youngster in Vic-
toria’s State schools, while saluting tin-
flag, had to declare :
1 love God and my country ; I honor the flag; I
will serve the King and cheerfully obey niy parents,
teachers and the laws.
Having thus perjured themselves to the satis-
faction of the authorities, the kids proceeded
to disobey parents and teachers with their
customary cheerfulness. Why Anzac Day
should be used as an excuse for compulsory
elocution of this amiably fatuous brand per-
haps Heaven knows. But it seems a pity
that the authors of the recitation did not
make young Victoria declare its unshakable
determination to be also kind to silkworms,
elderly relatives and guinea-pigs; never to
wear dirty finger-nails, and to regard gam-
bling with cigarette-cards as unbecoming a
little gentleman.

The attendant at Melbourne morgue was
disturbed by a recent battering at the door
of his happy home in the small, dank, cold
hours. He found a very tall, thin young
man, with a dispirited ginger mo. leaning
on the jamb, belting the door with his boot,
which he had taken off for the purpose.
“What is it?” asked the attendant, hospit-
ably. “I’ve been turned out of everywhere,”
said the belated one, “and I’m told perhaps
you’d take me in.” The morgue floor-
walker explained the scope of his establish-
ment. “I might take you in,” he said, “but
not alive.” The tall, damp man was not to
be put off. “Only dead men admitted?” he
said. “Oh, very well, I’ll soon settle
that.” Taking a knife from his pocket he
began to saw at his neck. And so quaint is
the thing we call our civilisation that he at
once qualified for a dry bed elsewhere.
RULE I.
THE GIRL: “ What is the first thing to do in
learning to fly?”
THE AVIATOR: “To sag your prayers.”
With the nation at war the engineering
trades have for weeks past been on strike
at the Naval Works, Garden Island, Sydney,
mainly because three unions disputed among
themselves about a man who drove an engine
of some sort. It was argued (1) that he
was an engineer, (2) that he was an elec-
trician, (3) that he was a gasman. After
weeks of idleness and chin-wag someone
hatched the brilliant idea of dispensing with
the plant which was used to generate elec-
tricity, and obtaining the current elsewhere.
This satisfied everybody, and a fresh start
was made on war material. That’s the
worst of this war. Somebody’s always nag-
ging at blokes to bog into work just when
they’re settling down to an interesting argu-
ment.
THE HOSE OF VICTORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A lady caused some sensation in the Strand on
Saturday by appearing in stockings which were
embroidered with the flags of the Allies.
Fair Mabel close attention begs
To Fashion’s latest stern decree,
Last week she clothed her slender legs
In patriotic hosiery;
Upon each calf in manner new
The gallant flags of Freedom flew.
And now when Mabel walks abroad,
Delighted people U.nd and stare;
They’re strongly tempted to applaud
The spectacle of bunting rare;
For, see, ’tis Mali’s symbolic r6le
To flaunt our flags from pole to pole,
Portending victory everywhere!
VICTORIA.
O. BLIN.


IN THE DARK.
“Bill, can’t yon see you’re needed?”
“Bow CAN I see when they blindfold me?”


THE RAVEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Raven,” cried he, “thing of evil,
Be ye bird or feathered devil,
Tell me truly, I command you,
In the sacred name of Gore!
Tell me, carrion bird of omen.
You who feast upon and know men,
Shall I yet with future foemen
Wipe the kultured German floor?
Be ye bird, or be ye devil,
Tell me strictly on the level,
Shall I prosper in the War?”
Quoth the Raven —“ Nevermore.”
“Raven,” cried he, “ghoul of slaughter,
Shall the blood of ivife and daughter,
Little boy and mother's suckling
Splash my heroes as of yore?
Shall they scourge anew the nations
With their Frightful devastations,
Till I offer loud oblations
To my German Gott of Gore?
Shall my sailors 'neath the water.
Pirates brave who give no quarter,
All come safely back to shore?”
Quoth the Raven — “Nevermore.”
Thus the Raven, never quitting,
Still is sitting, still is sitting
On the Nemesis in marble
Over Wilhelm's study door;
And its eyes, so red and blinking,
As of one that's drugged with drinking,
Seem to set the Kaiser thinking
Of the reckoning in store,
And his head, now slowly shrinking,
Whilst the brain within is kinking,
Shall be stvelled — ah, nevermore !
VICTORIA.
O.K.
NEVERMORE!

Edward Wilkinson Deane, surgeon-cap-

sounded in Egypt was near enough to
native-born, having emigrated from Eng-
land, 42 years ago, as a two-year-old. At
Melbourne Uni. he had a brilliant course,
and passed on to Melbourne Hospital as
senior resident, and thence to the Alfred. He
was in practice up-country until about this
time last year, when he decided to go and
help patch Billjim at the Front. It was
acute cystitis that finished off the over-
worked frame. Another fine character that
Maryborough lost in the near past was
Jolley, the beloved little lawyer who sent
Hans Irvine into political oblivion. He and
Deane were pals.

Tubb, just back from England by way of the
U.S.A. Tubb is one of the little Gallipoli
bunch. Both soldiers have been earning their
living at the great Australian industry of
grass-growing; and both belong to families
well known up and down the Goulburn
Valley.
Jack Doyle, who takes the box-seat in
the N.S.W. Political Labor League, has
shouldered the responsibilities of the Letter-
press Machinists for 15 years. Till 1900 or
thereabouts the machinists bad been badly
sweated, and worst of all in the “religious”
papers of that time. More recently Doyle
pushed Labor’s eight-hour side-show at Syd-
ney. He is a close-reasoning non-militant,
and seemed hardly the man to get the sup-
port of the vociferous delegates who turned
the 1916 conference up on end.
Roger Casement recalls Wolfe Tone, one
of the moving spirits of ’9B. Tone, detected
in plotting treason, fled to America, and
afterwards to France, then at war with Eng-
land. With a French squadron he attempted
to force a landing on the Irish coast. But
his luck was as bad as Casement’s, for be
was captured, convicted of treason and sen-
tenced to death. To save the executioner’s
time he did the job himself in Dublin prison
in November. 1798.
Alexander Jobson puts the crossed swords
of a brigadier-general on his shoulder straps,
and in a day or two marches off to the war
from Sydney. Soldiering has been His side-
line and bobby ever since the days when
he was actuary for the A.M.P. Society in
Melbourne. When the Yankee Equit-
able came to Australia and started to rain
palaces on the big cities, Jobson was
selected from many candidates as the
society’s actuary in this continent, with
headquarters in Sydney; and then the
Scotch regiment got the benefit of Jobson’s
driving force. Later on, the Equitable giv-
ing up the hunt for business in Australia,
its former actuary went into business as a
consultant and accountant, and, incidentally,
found out that he had a pen. lie used it
first in prodding The Bulletin’s wild
cats; then he was encouraged to take up
the job of financial instructor ,to the Sun’s
hundred thousand or so readers. He married
a daughter of old Judge McFarland, is a
family connection of the Steads, and is a
I'obust, high-principled Australian..
Passed out at Apia. Thomas Trood. oldest
white inhabitant of Samoa, one-time British
vice-consul and since the occupation by
Maoriland troops Assistant Native Judge.
Trood was born in Somersetshire (Eng.),
but came to Sydney at live years of age in
the early ’4o’s with his father, a master-
printer. After the father's death in 1850 he
went back to the (’old Country for a while,
travelling in the Thomas Arbuthnot, which
carried the first gold from Australia to Eng-
land to lie shown at the London Exhibition
of 1851. Two years later Trood returned
and went into the island trade. After losing
all his cash in a search for a reputed pearl-
shell ground of fabulous wealth, he was
a bookkeeper in Samoa for ’some years, and
then went to manage a German business in
Tonga. Shirley Baker, a one-time Wesleyan
missionary, was then running Tonga as a
sort of dictator. Trood headed the British
residents in running Baker off the rails, and
was consequently sacked by his German em-
ployers. He returned to Samoa and w r ent
planting, but was burnt out in the '9o's, and
•then became secretary to the municipality
at Apia. After the German annexation in
1900 he was made acting British vice-consul,
and lived to see the Maoriland expeditionary
force hoot the Hun out of the group. When
Robert Louis Stevenson was buried the
grave was made by mistake on part of
Trood's land, and on the error being discov-
ered he presented the site to Stevenson’s
widow. His chief grief in late years was that
as his vice-consulship still remained on an
“acting;” basis, though he had held the office
for 14 years, lie was not entitled to a salute
of guns when he went aboard a visiting war-
ship for a cocktail—an omission which he
fancied lowered British prestige with the
natives.
“HE WHO PLAYS WITH THE DEVIL HAS THE DEVIL TO FAY."
Professor Chapman, of Adelaide, has just
lost a son in the war. The lieutenant
was a surveyor on the Murray anu in the
Northern Territory before the trouble
began; and at Christmas. 1914, when the
Australians seemed to have taken root at
Cairo, he applied to the War Office for
something to do in the Royal Engineers.
The few men who did this, thinking to see
active service the sooner, were much dis-
gusted at being wired for to go to London
just a few days before the Anzac landing.
However, lie got back in time for two
months’ strenuous work before the evacua-
tion. And now a stray bullet has found
him.
FREDERIC
VILLI HRS,

correspondent.
Old “Kick” Fitzgerald, the' Castlemaine
brewer, married a daughter of John
O’Shanassy, Premier of the second Ministry
that ever Victoria had ; and their son is a
Lieut.-Colonel in a crack cavalry regiment,
the 11th Hussars. At the siege of Lady-
smith. during the Boer picnic, the young man
got the D. 5.0,; lately he lias added to that
the Legion of Honor. Appropriately he
married into the Beerage : his bride was the
1 hike of Sutherland’s widow, who is some-
thing of an authoress.
Australian bird-man Harry G. Hawker
burst out again in England last week by
upsetting altitude records with a climb of
21.408 ft. —over four miles up among the
stars.
Just 12 months after the landing at
Anzac, it is officially decided that Ken Gor-
don, of Glenelg (S.A.), was lost in the
struggle of that fateful daybreak. He dis-
appeared. but all through the year there
have been rumors of bis being in one hospi-
tal or another, or a prisoner in Constanti-
nople. Now it is admitted that there is no
hope. A son of the late police-magistrate
James Gordon, and nephew of the Judge, he
was a brilliant athlete, especially in the
water. Ilis elder brothel - . Leslie Gordon,
a lawyer, was killed in Gallipoli, too.
Bishop Peel, of Mombasa, who passed out
the other day, was chiefly responsible for
the "Kikuyu” trouble of (three years ago.
which gave Anglicanism the biggest jolt it
has had for half a century. Peel and his
next-door neighbor, Bishop Willis, of
Uganda, drafted a federation of missions
working in East Africa, and arranged a con-
ference to discuss it. Both their dioceses
are “Low Church.” and don’t hit it too well
with the neighboring “High Church" diocese
of Zanzibar; nevertheless they invited Bishop
Weston, of that see. to come to the confer-
ence. Weston replied that lie didn’t notice
any invitation to B.C's. and he suggested
that they ought to be included, as the federa-
tion professed to be a united effort of Chris-
tians against Mohammedans. Of course
Peel and Willis wouldn't hear of it, so
Weston wouldn’t go. For all that, the
conference met at Kikuyu, and fixed up a
scheme of federation, which allowed minis-
ters to exchange pulpits and so on. Bishop
Peel, who presided, finished the conference
by giving communion at an Anglican service
in a Presbyterian church to missionaries ot
various Protestant bodies. Wesfoij prompt!'
reported him to Canterbury, and clamored
for a prosecution for schism; but nothing
came of it except a wild row.
The Speck's Parliament has the oldest
Sergeant-at-Arms in Australasia and pro-
bably in the world. T. B. Blytli, who has

bers in order lie was one himself.
ABOU BILL ADAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
\Y r c had several Bill Adamses on the Peninsula.
—Letter from an Anzac.
Abou Bill Adams (how Ills kind increase!),
Sick of the long delays of maundering peace,
Got into khaki, seized his rifle brown,
Damned Quiet’s measly ways, forsook the town,
And, having struck the Gaba Tepe fray
(So he relates), found some who’d run away;
But, using well his bay’net’s business end,
lie made them drop the flight they did intend,
And face again the Turkish grim array,
And drove them till they won that bitter day.
At Suvla, Anzac —names of endless fame —-
With sim’lar pluck he did the very same ;
He seized his halting Major by the chin
And cried: “Old man, buck up! Go in, and win!’
And certain dandy ofticahs who stood
Astounded at the smell of death and blood,
He seizes by the slack part of the pants
(So he avers) and suddenly decants
The dastards in a trench of battling Turks,
To make minute inspection of the works.
The General, hearing of these valiant deeds,
Remarks: “Bill Adams, say—what are thy needs?
Dost sue for knighthood on thy bended knee,
Or crave the gift of valor-won V.C. ?
How shall I tell them of those fights of thine,
How write the deeds that warm us up like wine?”
Said Adams: “Sir, I never was a slacker,
And ’art your coves required a pushing backer.
So, if you please, just take your blooming pen,
Write me as one who shoved his fellow-men!”
And when they printed it as Bill had told,

The A.M.P. decided that it was its duty to
take war policies. General-manager Teece
had an idea, in fact, that all expeditionaries
ought to be insured —as no doubt they should
be. But that would have had to be done, of
course, in collaboration with the Common-
wealth Government, and there were insuper-
able difficulties in the way. So those who
were already insured with the A.M.P. went
off to the war fully covered without extra
charge; but those who had neglected the
duty of insuring had to pay a special
premium of 5 p.c. and upwards. How the
business will work out nobody knows vet.
The world has no data for such a war as this.
The immediate effect is a marked fall in
the bonuses. The society estimates its war
claims at £343,053; and that reduces the
bonus by about 20 p.c. Here are the figures
for some years past:—
1888-1893 (boomyears) . . 40.3 p.c. of premiums.
1893-1898 .. .. 34.1 „
1898-1903 .. .. 34.8 ~
1903-1908 .. .. 36.0 „
1908-1913 . . . . 38.2 „
1914 39.2 „
1915 30.8 „
The distribution for the past year might
have been a point or so larger, but war
claims are still coming in, and in case of
accidents in the current year the contingency
reserve was increased from £90,000 to
£125,000.
Even 30.8 p.c. is a splendid bonus. It
means that of every £5 which a man pays in
premiums he gets back in the shape of
added insurance a shade over £1 10s. It
is a really amazing thing, when you come
to think of it, that an insurance office can
pay any sort of bonus in existing circum-
stances. Consider what it means. Here is
an office which has prepared premium tables
to meet average conditions. The principal
element in the calculation is what is known
as expectation of life. A man of 25, by the
law of averages, ought to live about 37
years. That is to say, he ought to pay in
37 annual premiums before his life policy
becomes a claim. Instead, he goes to war,
and, being killed, his widow or other bene-
ficiary gets the full value of his policy after
perhaps one or two or three payments. The
society’s loss is the aggregate of the
expected payments, accumulated at com-
pound interest. And still, notwithstanding
that loss, there is a bonus to divide of more
than 30s. for each £5 paid !
This paragraph will try to explain how
the apparently impossible is made possible.
In the first place capital is in great demand
in this desperate struggle; the imaginative
Lloyd-George talked of the war being won
by the silver bullet. So interest has
bounded up. This society can’t get the
benefit of this rise on all its assets, because
some of its funds are invested at fixed rates ;
but it is able to make better use of a whole
lot of money. This is the result:—
Interest Realised on Average Funds-
-1904.. £4 9 0 p.c. I 1910.. £4 9 8 p.c.
1905.. 4 9 8 „ | 1911.. 4 9 8 „

1908.. 4 9 4 „ | 1914.. 412 10 ~
1909. .4 9 8,, | 1915. . 414 4 „
That £4 14s. 4d. is just ss. p.c. more than
the A.M.P. earned seven years ago and over
2s. 6d. more than it earned in the year
before the war. Total funds (exclusive of
Investment Fluctuation Reserve) are
£34,809,878; and half-a-crown p.c. on that
lot means £43,500 a year. The war, while
taking much out of the society's purse, drops
that handy little amount in. And it will go
on thus dropping in a considerable sum long
after the war is over and the special claims
have been met. But. to be on the safe side,
it hasn’t been assumed that even £4 10s.
p.c. will be earned. All the calculations
have been made on the assumption of the
average interest being only 3 or 34 p.c.
The earnings beyond that are all available
for bonus. Further, there is a small gain
in the matter of expenses. These loaded
war policies, for instance, probably need
little canvassing. So we get a further
shrinkage in the expense rate: —
Expenses Compared with Total Income.

1908.. 8 19 6 „ 1914. . 8 15 5 „
1909. . 8 12 11 „ 1915. .8 9 7,,
A saving of ss. p.c. here means another
£lO,OOO or £ll,OOO available for bonuses.
However, this isn’t a permanent gain,
whereas the improvement in interest, if not
exactly permanent, will be here for more
than a year or two.
The expenses shown above are p.c. of
total income. But that really isn’t much of
a standard. An office might do very badly
and still show better figures than the A.M.P.
on that basis. A fairer though quite arbi-
trary way is to charge the old or renewal
premiums with 7 p.c., and the annuity busi-
ness with 3 p.c.; then the balance of exes,
will be the cost of procuring the new busi-
ness. By that method we get the figures in
the last column of this table :

It’s a fair figure, this 82.5 p.c.; but not at
all startling. Other Australian offices are
well forward in this comparison.
Safety being the first consideration, the
nature of the investments is of the utmost
consequence in a life office. Formerly the
tendency was to put almost everything into
mortgages. Public stocks have now taken
first place; and that security is obviously
better:—

The A.M.P. holds out the expectation of
bonuses in this section, too. The valuation
at the end of the year showed a surplus of
£12.254, of which £7OBO is to be divided in
bonuses on policies in force five years and
over. But the insurer in this branch who
pays much heed to bonuses and keeps his
policy going for five years is a fitter subject
for the Ordinary branch. There only 2s. 7d.
of every £1 he would pay in premiums goes
in expenses, whereas in the Industrial branch
Os. 7d. in the £ goes that way. The thing
for every Industrial policy-holder to struggle
after is a transfer to the Ordinary branch,
whereby he thus saves 4s. in the £.

A nice profit and a nice margin beyond the
dividend. No evidence of bad times there.
But was there evidence of bad times just
prior to the shocking experiences of
1893-4-5? In November. 1891, the chairman
of this bank said “there was nothing in the
present state of affairs in Victoria at all
evehts to show that business was in any
way unsound” ; and the usual dividend was
paid. Within a couple of years dividends
were out of the question, and after
struggling for a while one-fifth of the capital
Was written off as lost; and that was a
mere nothing compared with what some
banks suffered.
This is recalled at the present time
because people are asking now what they
were asking then—-“ Where are the signs of
hard times?” There are none —there are
only signs that, for the fools in particular,
hard times are coming. When you see a
man whose salary is £5 a week having a
razzling time on Moet and chicken, topped
up with stalls and suppers and taxis, you
see no signs of hard times. But you know
that unless he has a private purse he is
going to have a pretty bad time before next
pay-day comes round. That is just how it
is with Australia, and to a great extent also
with England. What we must understand
is. that we don’t pay a bill when we pay
with an lOU. We merely say “Call to-
morrow !’ And the more people who call
to-morrow the more strenuous the day we
are going to have. There are thousands of
men who say: “Well, the bill will have to
be paid out of taxes, and taxation isn’t
going to touch me.” They make a mistake,
taxation is going to touch them. It will
be passed on just as every extra expense is
passed on. How bad the hard times ahead
of us are going to be this paper doesn’t
know. So much depends upon the seasons
and the markets that will follow the war.
But this is beyond all doubt whatever: the
present times are* abnormal because this
£'’jntcy is spending internally over
£_,).(Mlt) 900 a year which it isn’t earning.
From this to the normal there is a droo
with an unpleasant bump at the bottom of
it. But what is coming may be a good deal
worse than the normal. The chances are it
will be.
The immediate question is, Will banks
suffer? This paper doesn’t expect them to
suffer as they did in the early ’9o’s. Then
it was they who had borrowed, and their
capital was insanely guaranteeing the boom
values. To-day the Governments are the
borrowers ; to some extent the banks are the
lenders. They lost their money then because
the English and Scotch depositors wanted
their money back, and the banks had to
realise the securities in which thaf'money
had been invested. To-day there are no
foreign depositors to put the Australian
banks in that awkward position. There is
no reason to expect, then, that there will be
any shrinkage in deposits—or very much
shrinkage, at any rate. There will be
therefore no need to rush securities on to
an unfavorable market; and that is how the
big losses of capital previously occurred.
Still there may be losses. For instance,
suppose wheat should fall to 2s. 6d. after
the war. That would mean a revaluation of
the whole of the agricultural areas, and
possibly foreclosure on a lot of securities.
This question of prices after the war con-
stitutes the big problem. As for current
profits, they are bloated, of course, when
market prices are bloated: 1 p.c. on a ton of
copper, for instance, is worth now about
twice as much as it is in ordinary times.
And when copper is £lOO a ton the banker
can more easily get 1 p.c. for financing it
than he can get f p.c. when the price is
only £5O and the copper-man fights hard
over every penny. A slump will reduce
profits that way. And the grind to pay taxes
will put a damper on that speculation in
land, shares and merchandise from which a
bank in buoyant times gets so many pick-
ings. This paper doesn’t believe anybody
knows what the future holds for us ; but it
thinks it sees a pretty large chance for
reduced banking profits.
As for the past 12 months the Royal of
Australia shows these movements: —

But those figures ought to be taken only
with the mustard in the previous para-
graphs. Still they show certain features
wdiich are quite satisfactory in themselves.
For instance, the total deposits and other
debts to the public are less than £5 for every
£1 of the shareholders’ funds (capital and
reserves), which ought to be very comfort-
ing to the creditors: and 43 p.c. of all the
deposits and other liabilities is held liquid
or in public securities, and that is very
comforting too. As for the shareholders
their comfort can be drawn from the fact
that the bank has been making well over
5 p.c. on its capital more than it has been
dividing.

On the figures the Colonial, too. has worked
itself into a very comfortable position,
thanks to (1) the gruelling lesson which it
and other banks got 20-odd years ago; and
(2) the unexampled run of good seasons
and high prices. As a result of the old
lesson the dividends have been kept
moderate, and an amount equal to one-third
of the capital has been added to the reserves
in the past seven years. Whether the lessons
have been learned so well that the bank has
kept clear of overvalued securities can onlv
be told when the market breaks on the
present loan boom coming to a stop.
If that can t be told, however, there are
Matures that are quite clear.

usual, though the dividend was dropped
halt a point, there is very little left after the
shareholders have had their cut. It is pro-
bable, however, that the management is still
gradually putting its house in order; and
for years it w’as a very untidv house, be-
cause the directors had long ago jibbed at
making a clean sweep by writing off capital.
How much is being done in this way can,
however, only be guessed at. In any case,
the bank s profit in proportion to its capital
is probably not large. This is explained by
the comparative smallness of the public's
money in the business. Here are the bal-
ance-sheet items:—
Mar., ’l5. Mar., ’l6.
Bills and notes .. £19,962 £25,021 Inc. £5,059
Deposits, etc. . . 1,636,287 1,630,349 Dec. 5,938

Premises .. .. 78,143 81,327 Inc. 3,184
Thus the public’s money in the business is
£1,655,370; and the capital and reserves
total £630.547. Many an Australian bank
has the use of £7 or £8 of outside money
for every £1 of its own ; and English banks
usually have a great deal more. This one
has only about £2 12s. 6d. Further, of the
£1,655.370 there is no less than
£715,007 in cash and liquid assets, and very
little of it is earning anything. All this
means exceptional security for the deposi-
tors and other creditors; also it means little
risk for the shareholders. But it likewise
paeans comparatively poor earnings. Judg-
ing by the figures one would say that there
are still on hand assets that don’t bring in
a great deal of money; and the bank, with
these assets in its eye, seems resolved to go
slow and make the capital worth all of 20s.
in the £ while risking as little as possible,
h is a policy for which no doubt a great
deal can be said; but it doesn’t attract
nearly 7 as much attention as a shower of
rockets. The old mistake was in not
writing down assets and capital and then
paying a dividend more attractive than 4
or 5 p.c. It may be infinitely more to the
credit of a bank to pay only 4 or 5 p.c. than
8 or 10 p.c.; but the public is very slow to
see the virtue of it.

“Does it drive on the profit side?” That’s the
question that confronts the mine-manager when he is
considering the belting question. “Chromol” leather
belting always drives on the profit side, that is why
it is so highly recommended. It is mineral tanned
and possesses heat- and moisture-resisting qualities
that prevent deterioration. Under the most severe
atmospheric or industrial conditions it stands the test
without flinching. On many of the stiffest drives in
the largest mining plants in the Commonwealth it is
used exclusively. Its reliability and durability
recommend it to mine-managers everywhere. J. C.

for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“The Ilardinge Conieal Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

more or less idealists; no doubt it was on
this account that they turned their attention
chiefly to the artistic decoration of the home.
- And being idealists they have evolved a
scheme whereby every employee may become
. a partner in the business and banish the
; cheap and nasty from his own home. Regu-
larly for some time past an appropriation
has been made out of profits for the benefit
of what are called “staff partners,” and this
year £4107 is transferred that way :
To purchase staff-partnership certificates (trans-
ferred from reserves) .. .. .. £3300
Appropriated from this year’s profit for same
purpose . . . . . . . . . . 650
Appropriated for dividend to staff partners . . 157
Total .. ..£4107
The true profit for the year seems thus to
be £20,450 plus £3300 = £23,750 ; and that
compares very well with the figures for the
preceding term, notwithstanding that the co.
has had to do a lot of explaining in the 12
months. But, if the fact that the Wunder-
lichs themselves have been British for three
generations isn’t to count, the character of
the co. ought to be fairly well established
by the fact that less than 1300 shares in a
total of 222,591 are held by persons of
enemy origin. Had the Wunderlichs been
the usual stodgy old crowd they might have
passed muster as good-enough Britishers
after three generations. But obviously
there must be something wrong with a con-
cern whose managing directors want to mix
art and business and idealism!
In any case, though, the co. was bound to
see smaller profits than those of ’l2-Y3-T4.
There is still a lot of construction work in
progress, certainly ; but it isn’t the sort with
which this co. has much to do. In N. S.
Wales it is chiefly such work as Norton
Griffiths can carry out with a shovel. Nor
is it very likely that things will rapidly im-
prove either in N. S. Wales or in the other
States where the co. has hung out its well-
known sign. One advantage it will have;
it will be sitting behind very comfortable
finances when it meets dull times. At the
end of February it owed on all accounts
£48,691, and it held, apart from freeholds,
premises, plant and stock, assets worth
£105,204, including £60,866 of investments
and deposits and £37,444 of book debts.
The capital consists of £40,000 in 7 p.c.
Ist prefs. ; £40,000 in 7 p.c. 2nd prefs., and
£142,591 in ordinaries ; and various goodwill
items have been taken over at £65,701. But
a special reserve has been accumulated
against that; and, discarding goodwill
entirely, the capital is now intact, and
£22,872 of assets are left over. The true
value of a great part of the assets depends,
however, on what this co. can earn with
them.
Duke and Main Leads Consols, Marybor-
ough (Vic.), has 4800 ft. of gutter to the
north to work and nothing to the south,
where it has bumped into the boundary fence.
So the end of the Duke Consols is in sight.
The company has spent a useful life, hav-
ing gutted out 13,000 ft. of the Duke lead,
and sluiced into the melting-pots of the
Royal Mint a nice little parcel of 2 tons
llcwt. of gold. Put into cash, gold and
slimes won total £383,400, of which £70,000
has been handed out in divs. This is 28s.
per share on a paid-up capital, inclusive of
water, of £61,458, so there was not much
real profit. Money has gone this way:—
Wages, stores and timber . . £324,850
Machinery .. . . .. .. 22,035
Royalty, rents and taxes .. .. 12,600
Office and fees .. .. . . 8,002
At present the mine has a block of 1200 ft. of
the lead ready for the parties ahead of the
panelling line; but the run of pay-dirt is
only 240 ft. wide. It should average about
15dwt., and costs should be about 455. per
fathom. Every additional penny will tell in
a big mine like the Consols. The reason
why alluvial cos. rose against Justice
Powers’s wages award is disclosed by mana-
ger Glover, who shows that his wage bill is
up £220 monthly. Compulsory insurance
accounts for another £3O, and supplies for
still another £3O. With £4OOO annually
added to exes., the management will have to
skim past a lot of dirt that otherwise would
have given a profit.
The sole remaining joy of Beaufort (Vic.)
is the Northern Hope. Not so long ago
Ballarat jobbers announced that 12s. was in
sight in divs., whereat the knowing ones
passed out their scrip to all who would buy.
As the accounts show divs. of £6BOO paid
out of £48,335 of gold won, they did a timely
get-out. Now D. 11. Browne is going ahead
with a boring plant along the Waterloo-road
to try to catch the turnover of the deep
ground. His top deck, off No. 3 rise, opened
up poorly, but some compensation came in
the grade of the wash north of the same rise.
In the main north level and the west branch-
drive the prospects wouldn’t help a beggar
to a crust. Browne, besides being a good
miner, has faith in Beaufort —and the faith
of the boss often helps a forlorn hope to
success. The deep lead at Beaufort is one
of those mining problems that the State
wants to see solved, and it might do worse
than help the job on a bit.
Gone are the smart covers and delicately-
drawn plans of the Langi Logan South half-
yearly reports. Gone, too, is another mine-
manager. According to his,, first report
George Bryant looks to be having a lot
tougher job than when he took command at
the Cathcart. Water is still the problem.
The panelling staff has gone, for after all the
available patches around Nos. 1 and 3 rises
had been sent to the surface it was no use
working in the heavy wet ground if the
water could be squeezed out and fresh levels
got by a better way of draining. Off No. 4
rise to the north-east a pilot drive is going
out to test the wash up the gutter. This
little pilgrim won’t be of vital service until
that happy day when the north-east main
under-level can be shoved out to tap the
water that blocks progress in the intermedi-
ate workings. Seeing the breakaway that
took place a while ago down south, care will
be necessary, but Bryant’s experience at
Eldorado will serve him when handling the
heavy ground.

The present boom in antimony has awak-
ened the bush adjacent to Kilmore (Vic.),
and one can hardly go out without stum-
bling over a wild cat. All the old mines are
being got in order, shafts are being repaired
and water pumped out. The shows were
worked principally for gold a few years
back, and not much thought was given to
the antimony ore in them. Now it is
believed _ that they would pay as antimony
propositions, with the insufficient gold as
merely a side-line.
Corinthian North (W.A.) hopes to increase
its sulphide-mill capacity by 1500 tons a
month, and its gold output proportionately.
Last year 48,000 tons of oxidised, 2500 tons
of sulphide and 1400 tons of accumulated
slimes were treated for an average extraction
of 15s. 6d., 275. Id. and 14s. 9d. respectively.
This year’s jreserves are all sulphide, com-
prising 70,257 tons of 28s. ore, blocked out
on four sides, and 30,140 tons of “probable”
supplies of 255. value. After expending
£33,000 on mining, plant additions, etc,, and
writing off £4114, the net profit for the year
was £56. At the end of the current year
the directors anticipate that there wili be
enough in the cupboard to give shareholders
a bite.

A Court has gone to Meekatharra
(W.A.) to try to right things. The award
of 1910 fixed the rate for truckers, mul-
lockers and shovellers at 11s. lOd. per shift,
except in the richest mine, the Fenian, where
12s. 6d. was then being paid, and at which
rate the Court included the show in the new
award. Everything went smoothly until a
few months ago, when the Fenian truckers
and mullockers demanded 13s. 4d. per shift
without an appeal to the Court. ~ The em-
ployers resisted, the mine was closed
down, and most others followed suit. Hol-
man, M.L.A., whose definition of an open-cut
at the hearing of the 1910 plant was “an
’ollow ’ole in the side of an ’ill,” is managing
the case for the workers.
In three months 14160 z. has been taken
out of the New Boddington (W.A.), and the
gold in the residues is estimated to bring
the value up to £6OOO. The co. originally
had a capital of £3750 in 375 £lO shares, but
has now filled out to £12,000 in 120,000 2s.
shares.

Kalgoorlie is protesting against the poor
encouragement given to the mining of low-
grade ore by the Water Supply Department.
The big mines can get supplies for sluicing
tailings at Is. 6d., and market gardeners are
supplied at 2s. 6d. per lOOOgals.; but strug-
gling syndicates and parties of working
miners battling with 20s. ore have to pay
7s. 6d. There is a regulation under which
water can be supplied to low-grade shows at
2s. per lOOOgals., but to get this concession
the value of the ore has to be too poor to
work. Some parties have managed to keep
going by using shaft water for treatment,
but in most cases supplies from this source
have given out. With cheap water, a large
low-grade area at the north end of the field
would, it is claimed, be made productive.
The bursting of the Central boom has hurt
Westonia badly. When the shares were soar-
ing a few influential persons arrived from
Melbourne and started to make things hum.
Gaudy assays were posted almost daily and
the new find was boosted. Brokers’ touts
talked of nothing but profits in sight, and
flags were flown every time a new progress
report was issued, \yhen everything else
failed to stimulate the market it was an-
nounced that the mill was going to treat
3000 tons a month, and that, starting in
May, regular monthly divs. of Is. and
upwards would be paid. Few stopped to
consider how the increased tonnage was
to be got out of the new find without
further development. It is the old story
over again : a deluded, trustful public allow-
ing itself in the excitement of a gamble to
be fleeced by a few cool customers who have
been all through that kind of thing before.

Nullagine, the Collins House co. which
proposes to wash dividends out of Westralia,
had some of the bad luck it deserved. It
was unnecessarily importing machinery in a
ship that caught fire; and now Australia is
repairing and patching. No production has
therefore been yet done on the remote show ;
but further prospecting doesn’t lead Alex.
Campbell and his co-venturers to think their
prospects are any poorer.
Mount Morgan Extension (Q.) is prospect-
ing on the outskirts of a mine that has paid
between eight and nine millions in divs. Tom
Mills has been using some of his Towers pro-
fits to back up this show ; and as Tom is at
present in London we have the odd result
that samples are assayed there. The best of
late days went 13.9 p.c. copper and 16
grains of gold, which would be very enticing
if it was from a bulk lot of 100 tons. But
it isn’t. The crosscut at the 750 ft. level is
in a solid body of ore, but it is very low-
grade—say, 1 p.c. copper. The workings are
nearly on a line with the 1000 ft. level in the
big mine.
After years of neglect, deep-sinking lias
been restarted at Croydon (Q.), and to that
end the Iguana Consols has been equipped
with a winding plant. The Mines Depart-
ment is backing the venture.

Mount Cuthbert (Q.) has bought the
Orphan group, near the Dobbin, some 12
miles from home. They have been worked
by private owners for high-grade ore.
At last the Queensland Government has
purchased the practically-never-used Mount
Molloy tramline (20 miles) from the liquida-
tors. The line runs from Biboohra to Mount
Molloy, which is only 20-odd miles from
Port Douglas. If the line is extended down
fhe range it will provide another route to
the coast when the Cairns line gets blocked
by a landslip.
Mount Elliott (Q.) is still developing a
number of copper shows; but its most im-
portant work of late has been the opening
up of the big calcite body at the Great Aus-
tralia. This lode at the 300 ft. level carries
about 3 p.c. copper, and will prove valuable
as a flux. Fuel will always be expensive on
Cloncurry, but cheap metal-bearing fluxes
will simplify the smelting problem. For the
first three months of this year Mount Elliott
furnaced on its own account 2593 tons ore
for 255 tons copper, worth £25,500. The
bulk of the ore was railed from the Hamp-
den Consols, which continues to supply a few
tons of 10 p.c. stuff per day. But Mount
Elliott has done its dash, and its shares were
recently sold in London at 905., which is 10s.

dredgeable area of 440 acres; from this
(taking tin at £l7O and costs at 4d.) A. W.
Freeman calculates a recovery which would
give a profit of £295,000 in 171 years. The
vendors’ representations, which are well
supported by expert evidence, are all the
better w T orth attention because these people
are in the business as a regular thing and
can’t afford to introduce failui’es. In this
case they have tested the area at 331 points
and taken 3000 sectional samples; and they
ought to have a pretty good idea of what it
is stuffed with. The thing they don’t know
is the future of the tin market.
* * * *
The Austral-Malay people who struck the
Kampong and the Kamunting seem to have
stumbled on another winner in remote
Bolivia. The syndicate sent Bethune, a
dredging engineer who had been working
for the same group in Siam and thereabouts,
and he and the Sydney business man who
went with him have reported that, not only
is the proposition extraordinarily rich, but
the conditions are suitable for dredging;
and they strongly recommend the syndicate
to go ahead with the big purchase. The
whole business is accidental. Gore Adams,
a M.L. engineer, taking a spell from the
high levels of the Andes, called in at Syd-
ney, and started to swap notes with the
engineers engaged in Malay dredging. This
Mendieta proposition is the result. The pro-
perty is at present worked in a primitive
way by a Spaniard, and he is washing out
50 tons of tin a month —something over
£125,000 worth a year. And it doesn’t in-
terest him a bit.
“D.F.” : It is often alleged that, apart from
the tariff, the freight on things imported from
abroad gives the Australian producer a big
slice of protection. There is more than usual
in this argument just now, but in many cases
it doesn’t amount to much. The 'Burnie
(Tas.) Marine Board is using 100 tons of
the shale oil produced at Latrobe and it
answers all right. But the freight from
Latrobe to Burnie (40 miles by rail) is
just about the same as the freight on oil
from New York to Burnie under normal
conditions. So that if the Yankee oil-
producer can put his oil on board at New
York cheaper than the'local people can de-
liver it at Latrobe, he is likely to get this
business —at any rate, unless there’s a
change somewhere.
One of the largest zinc mines in the
world is the Black Rock, in Montana
(U.S.A.). Last year it produced 62,000
tons of zinc in concentrates, and in recent
times recoveries from crude ore have been
greatly improved by the flotation process.
It is said in U.S.A. that flotation is capable
of adding 100,000 tons of spelter to the
annual output.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, May 1, 1916.
My Deau Akini, —
The memorial services on Anzac Day were
more in tune with public sentiment than the
clatter of the collection-boxes. The green
sward of the Domain made a bold amphi-
theatre for the pitcuresque open-air gather-
ing. But the affair was wretchedly stage-
managed. The phalanx of bobbies frankly
admitted they had "no instructions.” Dis-
tracted persons waving blue, white or tango
tickets dashed themselves in vain against
the Force. It didn't know a>< (/tiling —and
no one, except a mummy or a private secre-
tary, can know less. Then the tangos rushed
at an enclosure led by a forlorn hope who
had successfully stormed it. They were ad-
mitted. In five minutes they were hurled
out. Then they were re-admitted. The
blues and the whites had many similar adven-
tures. When they did find rest for the soles
of their feet they were heartily rained on
by a passing shower.
The G.-G. and Lady Helen wormed their
way through the packed herring-barrel or
official stand. William Cullen, C.J., in all
his finery, with lace ruffles falling over his
thin, nervous fingers, struggled through. So
did the Consuls. France. Belgium and Japan
were represented by a blaze of gold lace, the
millinery of Consul Watteeuw being line
enough for an aviary of birds o’ Paradise.
Parsons galore trimmed the edge of the
stand. The Archgaiters, Dr. Wright, true
to the English tradition, was late. When
Neville Mayman, after sundry excursions in
search of Distinguished Persons, at last tri-
umphantly produced him and his lady, it
was like pulling a camel through a needle’s
eye. But it was done. Returned soldiers
lined up in front of the stand. When the
moment for silence came at noon, a shrill
feminine voice at the back wanted to know
what was going to happen next. In reply
a collector droppped her box with a clatter.
"The Dead March in Saul” was the most
dignified item in the scramble.
The last race day at ltandwick had a
gorgeous Easter setting under a heavenly
blue dome. A nip in the air brought out
pony coats, bear rugs and ’possum mats, and
gave poor old bunny a chance of being use-
ful. Some of the skirts were so short that
as much silk stocking as anybody wanted to
see showed between the tops of the high
boots and the hem- Still, if this became
monotonous a stamped mauve velvet cuat,
worn over a summer skirt that trailed over
the feet, was a relief in the Futurist man-
ner. Black velvet tricorne hats are in
again. They want, what they rarely got on
Saturday, a pert young face under the peaked
brim. For the rabbit type of white eye-
lashed dame who usually fancies herself in
this “Scarlet Pimpernel” millinery, the re-
sult is disaster.
The official stand —the eyrie which is just
now the Holy of Holies for our Second Best
—was full of velvet and ermine. There’s
money still lying about a race meeting! Mrs.
Tom Rolin’s black silk had the long coat
s> flared that it stood out like an elegant
lamp-shade. Little Mrs. Donald Munro,
who comes from a Moree. station, jingled
ropes of beads over her dark blue frock. A
glittering toque perched like a small bird
on her trim locks. Girlie Bray, in one of
the new light putty-colored suits, tied up her
throat in black fur. In the creams, Janet
Knox was in the smart-setters’ latest cut.
The Nivisons loomed large in the official
stand. A big peachy-skinned daughter of
the Ohio homestead, who still answers to
the name of “Baby” Nivison, was clad in
smoke grey, with white furs as a climax.
Mrs. C. G. Wade and the twins made the
usual trio on the lawn; and Gordons.
Campbells and others descended from far-off
sheep walks.
The literary Lady Poore—she belongs to
the Irish family of Graves, who have ink in
their veins—has done the Expected. Her
book, “Recollections of an Admiral’s Wife,”
is due for the critics’ hurried meal and
local Sassiety’s equally-hurried search to see
if there’s any sprightly mention of certain —
well, let’s call ’em indiscretions.
Society spread its peacock’s plumage at
the Pacific (Manly) the other evening. Such
classics as the Fox Trot (by Miss Collins,
in pastel green gossamer and gold, and Mr.
Simmons, with his willow-wand figure in
the usual swallow-tails) cheered the droop-
ing spirits of the ex-tango circle. A plump
lady, Mrs. John Walker, laid out in a pat-
tern of gold grapes on a black ground, with
ermine and diamonds, was It, till a visitor
iu a leopard-skin mat, with claws dangling
down in front, swept past. Mrs. A. L.
Hughes, a graceful charmer who followed
the Leopard's spots (or was it Puma.'),
tooked meek and feminine in mere ermine
a long tail-less coat that was like a snow
drift. Eileen Keys, in raven drapery, wore
black tulle parapets on her youthful head.
A sprinkle of khaki and another sprinkle
that would have looked better in the sanie
color danced in the hall and dining-room with
the Best-Dressed. Mrs. Arthur Davies and
a titian-haired sister, Mrs. Weston, were
at the party. Mrs. Hotham counts the
profits. As I told you, they go to the
French's Forest (Homes-for-Soldiers) Fund
and Manly Hospital.
This is the lat-
est photo, of the
daring young
Maoriland airman,
Lieut. Brandon,
who lately chased
a Zeppelin off Lon-
don and helped to
bring it down in
the Thames estu-
ary. He was a
quiet, unassuming
young man who
had made a name
at school before
joining dad's old-
established 1 a w
firm, Brandon and
Hislop, at windy
Wellington. When
the Hun’s liigli-
air ships began
slaughtering babies and women in England
young Brandon quickly made up his mind
what he had to do, and he has been doing it
thoroughly ever since.
Mr. Bob Maddrell, of Braidwood, gave his
daughter May to Lieut. Rupert Downes on
Anzac Day. The bride was in a billowy
tulle gown with a white velvet train edged
with swansdown. She was veiled in the
old-fashioned way, and a bridal wreath of
orange blossoms held the misty white
drapery in place. Only bridesmaid, sister
Thelma —the lively lass who has just
accepted an engagement-ring herself —bil-
lowed in violet tulle with a gleam of white
silk peeping through. After St. James’s
the Queen’s Club for cake and chatter.
Friday was Writers’ Day at Government
House. People who boil the pot with press
work and do a bit of fiction in their odd
hours, poets, and an editor or two (the latter
very hard to snare) were asked to meet
Rider Haggard. The lion x-oared as gently
as a cooing dove to members of his own
craft, and was a delightful change after the
stony conversation of our Second Best.
A few strays not connected with the inky
way drifted in. Prof. MacCallum —he’s the
’Varsity Word on Literature—looked as wise
as three volumes of Carlyle. Prof. Jamie
Wilson was invited —possibly because he
struggled with the Censor’s job for 12
months. A tall, sandy-haired young man,
with an intelligent desire to be left alone,
Prof. Read, came in also. The learned
Louisa Macdonald, M.A., of the Women’s
College, mercifully refrained from addressing
us in any dead language.
Then came the Scribblers. Aide d’Apice
launched them at the door; the tall young
warrior Firth passed them on to his Ex. and
Lady Edeline; Secretary Budge bounced
them up in turn to King Solomon’s Mines,
where they found a tall, cheery bushy-beard
with a Presence and a flow of lively anec-
dotes.
Ethel Turner and Louise Mack, amongst
the bidden, were unable to be present. Poet
Rod. Quinn tore himself away from stanzas to
rosy dawns and nodded to well-browned prose.
Mrs. Mary Gilmore (verse), Nina Murdoch
(more verse), Mrs. Agnes Kettlewell (will
these rhymesters never end?) were there, and
Louis Stone, who wrote the little-larrikin
classic “Jonah.” Veteran Sam Griffith,
Australia’s great lawyer, retired to a corner
with his Ex. They seemed to be enjoying a
thrilling conversation —possibly about the
Statutes of King Charles I.
The Passionist Fathers’ fete in the Town
Hall did very well in spite of a rush of com-
peting brigands. The municipal stronghold
was dressed a la Cairo —or as near it as a
self-respecting, well-drained Australian build-
ing cares to get. The youthful Cecilia, the
Governor’s second daughter, opened the
affair. In spite of a tremolo in her speech
she pulled through safely, with the moral
support of small-sister Henrietta. Mrs.
Treflo, Mrs. John Barlow, Mrs. T. Dalton,
Mrs. O’Gorman Hughes and the two Lane-
Mullins ladies —wives of John and George—
were concerned in the show.
The Ascham garden fete for the 29th Bat-
talion Comforts Fund and the Flying Corps
caught the G.-G., and got him to remove the
veil which is supposed to close these affairs
till a Personage attends to matters. His
Ex., after a few playful twitterings re dead-
and-gone pie-war shows whose expenses swal-
lowed up the takings, came to a speedy end.
Ladv Helen stooped to take the inevitable
bouquet from an infant in ballet costume.
The other young ladies of the ballet—a won-
derful mixture of curls, white stockings and
verv short skirts —reminded one ot that
famous breaking-up party of Paul Dombey s.
Mrs. Baronet Cooper isn't so glad as she
thought she would be to find herself in the
Zep. area. Though it has got a Labor party
and beastly absentee taxes Australia is the
best place on earth just now, the lady hints.
Son Gerald, the youngest of the family, .s
training in England, and a brother or two
are in the same mind. So mother, who has
no daughters, is going to keep as close handy
as Kitchener allows.
Brigadier-General Alec Jobson. who goes
“abroad” with his battalion, was farewelled
fondly at his house in Bondi the other day.
Mrs. ‘Jobson ran the at-home, and moving
pictures —some being views of a famil>-gai(l-
ening parade —gave the guests entertain-
ment. Small son Peter and his cousin,
General Granville Ryrie’s heir, ran the
films. Mostly doctors and their wives were
there. Mrs. Jobson used to be Ruth
McFarland, a daughter of the late Judge;
another (laughter is Mrs. Granville lv>ne.
The decorative Jane McFarland, a one-time
Sydney belle, still retains her father’s name.
At a recent war wedding Alan Boyle, of
the Royal Flying Corps, younger hope of
M L.’s one-time Governor Glasgow, took on
new responsibilities. The bridegroom got
some of his education at Wanganui, and was
counted a broth of a boy. His sister is
Lady Alice Fergusson; she annexed the heir
to Sir Janies Fergusson, once Governor of
S. Australia and later on buried in the
Jamaica ’quake. Alan married Isabel
Hull, whose sister is Viscountess Charle-
mont, and there, if I’m correct, a third^ Aus-
tralasian Governor is concerned. Wasn t
Ranfurly’s consort a daughter of A iscount
Charlemont? Anyhow, she was the thud
beauty of her day.

Captain S. C. Herring, of the A.1.F.,
was recently decorated by the French Presi-
dent. The Australian is now a step or two
higher in the force. He used to be area-
officer in the Parramatta-Drummoyne dis-
tricts. Father —the late Gerard Herring—
was a one-time Under-Sec. for Lands here.
Mrs. Nicholas Larkins, who used to be
Etta Norris, sends a cooee from Hongkong.
The honeymoon trip had a wreck as an
unrehearsed item. “We left Manila in the
Empire 24 hours after a big N.Y.K. steamer,
and we saw her being dashed to pieces as
we passed on our way to Hongkong,” says
the bride in parentheses.
The Kenneth Mackays’ homestead near
Wallendbeen is housing her Ex. for a
day or so on her Red Cross flight round
country centres. The Mackays’ handsome
modern mansion was built a few years ago
on Mrs. Kenneth’s design. The right kind
of clay was handy ; also the men who knew
how to build what old settlers knew as
“pug” or pise. Cool in summer and warm
in winter, it has made an ideal bush home,
iu spite of the opposition of architects and
other experts who wanted bricks and
mortar.
A Melbourne man. Edmund Jowett, came
across with Rider Haggard and stayed over
the races. Like the visitor, Jowett can talk
land and literature with equal facility.
Dr. Watson, who is writing Australian
history and compiling early records (with
tact, no doubt), came over from Melbourne
with his wife for Easter.
A London correspondent mentions that
he saw Lieutenant Throssell, V.C. —he’s a
Westralian, as you know —at a wool sale in
the Cold City. The sons of this big patch
make a beeline for their home industries
whenever they can stalk them in the Fog.
Throssell saw the first lot knocked down at
this auction. The long claw of coincidence
had scratched it from a station near his
own Cow-Cowing.

Amongst the voluntary brush-workers on
Anzac Day was the tall young artist, Clelia
Bloxham. The family used to be in the

promises well, and trusts to Australian
scenery for her inspiration.

Governor Murray’s guest he saw the in-

(don’t start, Arini) ; birds o’ Paradise flash-
ing their golden plumage in the sun; water-
falls that look like the glittering cascades
in a pantomime. McMahon, who is a
Queenslander by birth, goes up now to look

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, May 1, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Stanleys opened the show of antiques
at Federal Government House on Friday.
It was really the job of Lady Helen, who
planned the exhibition; but as she and her
G.-G. were still away in Sydney, the State
Y r ices pronounced the incantations —and
then rushed away as though the place
was full of evil spirits. Several stall
queens lamented loudly that there was
no formal inspection of their roosts,
and they had not even set eyes upon
her Ex. Those w T ho did see her said she
looked sweet enough to eat. in a khaki coat
and skirt and a dear little hat with an ador-
able chin strap. Despite all this, his Ex.
wore his grey suit with a gloomy air. You
can’t cheer a man up with clothes.
Mrs. Isaacs (High Court family) and band
faced the Government House portico, which
was robed in autumn foliage and wild scarlet
berries —a brave show. Mrs. Bowes Kelly
and her tribe of fair-haired flapper daughters
flanked this loveliness with a purple sweets
stall. Mother, in cream cloth, simply blazed
with diamonds. The left wing was occu-
pied by more royal-purple stall, guarded by
Miss Nyulasy and Mrs. Ross-Soden. Sev-
eral men sat in the inner room counting all
the money. Professor Spencer, Bernard
Hall and Mr. Phillipson were of the number,
and they were heard to murmur that the
work would keep them till after dinner ; but
there were hordes of nice, sympathetic girls
with tea, and some of the vice-regal retain-
ers, on being referred to, thought “as how
somethink might be cooked” —eating having
been practised in the house until the depart-
ure of ’is Hexeellency. The exhibition
itself, being spread in the council room —on
the walls and along a big central table —
looked like a specially good view of wedding
presents. The Lord High Opener did not
get his facts quite shipshape for the speech,
and secretary Ella Symes lamented that he
mistakenly suggested a continuous auction.
The show, it seems, is an exhibition at first
with an auction to follow, the first bidding
being fixed for May 6.
The Creswell dame presided in a most
becoming hat. Many sailors were present
and the Naval Band played in the drawing-
room, carefully standing their instruments
on linen mats between selections. The
music got to the toes of the girl-helps at the
stalls and they sneaked into an inner draw-
ing-room, where they stepped till they were
breathless, assisted by a few soldiers. This
impromptu quite knocked out a concert,
which was postponed till later in the
week. The girls, on being told, said “What
do we care! Y’ou don’t get the chance of
a dance and partners very often these
times !”
There are some lovely things on view. The
donors’ names have been suppressed to avoid
possible outbreaks of jealousy. (Never in-
troduce your donor to a pal, as the Coster
might sing.) A prize panel has some won-
derful originals fitted thereon. A genuine
Rembrandt (vouched for as such) is placed
so that the viewer has to stoop till her chin
rests on the floor in order to see the exquisite
trifle properly. Fortunately I practise this
exercise every morning. On the same panel,
and on the same side of it, are two Valen-
tine Greens, one Douret and a Lucas van
Leyden. A very modest and poor woman
sent a wonderful cradle. It held her son in
his babyhood ; he lies now at Anzac. There
is some Georgian silver, comprising a tea
service and spoons—made by Dorothy Lang-
lar.ds, a woman silversmith of the time.
Amongst the odds and ends there is a hideous
but valuable Leech picture, a genuine rick-
shaw with pony shafts, and some Japanese
high-toned Saumarai swords.
But when the naval band played a modern
dancing tune the viewers made a break and
promised to look at the other old stuff later.
Some of our Anzacs tramped bravely,
through tow r n on Friday, and a number of
others were motored. Some of the mounted
street patrols were formed of local girls, clad
in neat riding costumes and mounted on fine
horses. They finished up by collecting for
the Purple Cross Fund, which does every-
thing for the relief of the injured four-
footer.
The headquarters of the 3rd Divisional
Train made a theatrical and melodious
break in the Anzac procession. A khaki
waggon drawn by eight fine chestnut horses
carried a dozen singing soldiers and a com-
plete collecting plant, and Senator Pearce
made a special inspection of the outfit from
the steps of Parliament House. Lance-Cor-
poral George Castles was in the team ; also
Billy Chisholm and Reg Wykeham. Hal
Howitt, grandson of the historical Howitt
of Burke and Wills’s time, was at the key-
board of the box piano. Walter Kirby man-
aged to scramble on to the triumphal car,
and the boys auctioned his songs at so many
guineas a time. Later on they dropped him
overboard, and drove off to pour the haul of
coin into the official cashbox.
Some suburbanites who had been indulg-
ing in wild patriotic sprees in the city in
honor of the Anzacs came home to discover
a stiff-legged stranger in very old clothes
delivering the winter’s supply of wood and
coal. They watched him wrestling with the
heavy bags for a while, and then asked
him where he had hurt his leg. “Gallipoli!’
he chirruped, and poured another torrent of
wood into the shed. Wiping liis perspiring
brow with his sleeve, he admitted that he
hadn’t seen the procession. “Yer see, me
an’ th’ boss have got just erbout all we can
do, what with the cold weather cornin’ on
an’ everybody singin’ out for stuff. Good-
night, missus!’’ And he limped away to his
cart. Good old Anzac! While _ learned
stay-at-homes argue about repatriation he
gees and repatriates himself.
Frederic Villiers wears two lines of war
ribbons across his Beau Brummel chest.
Used war correspondents to get medals ior
telling the truth and shaming the shirker?
Big Howard Taylor is quitting his chair
in the Melbourne Club and getting away to
the war in charge of horses —a beastly job
and a hard one, especially for a clubman past
the usual military age. But Howard has
been burning to do his bit in some capacity
or other, and now his chance has arrived.
The gladness due to General Fred Hughes’s
reappearance in his family circle is tempered
by the recent death of daughter Eileen’s
soldier fiance, Lieutenant Wilson, who passed
out in Egypt about two months back.
Details have come to hand of the sudden
death of Charley Black on board the home-
ward-bound Orontes two days out from Fre-
mantle. The young R.N.R. officer, who was
married to Beatrice, the baby daughter
of the late Purves, Iv.C., was earning a crust
on one of the family sheepruns when the
war called him to a British naval job. His
wife and child were on board the Orontes
with him when the black camel looked
through the porthole.
The luck of the Purves family seems to
be right out. One soldier son was killed;
another is missing; the third, Philip, who
married heiress Jeenie Robertson, has been
gassed and sent to England for repairs. Now
this news of brother-in-law Black comes in
from the sea.
Lieut.-Colonel William Scott, who got the
D.S.O. for his share in the Jif Jaffa affair,
is a C.E. of Melbourne University, and was
shire engineer at Oxley when the war
started. Oxley is a tiny town on the pic-
turesque King River Valley narrow-gauge
railway, which runs from Wangaratta up
to the roof of Victoria. William Scott the
elder is also an engineer. Until his recent
retirement to a Melbourne suburb, he was
for long a well-known figure in the affairs
of Casterton, in the Western District, and
attended to the upholstering of the Glenelg
Shire highways.
Energetic Gertrude Rennie, of the Quamby
Club, who organised the movement for send-
ing a Christmas stocking to every John Tar
in the Australian Navy, is proudly display-
ing a brooch made of copper taken from
Nelson’s Victory, and sent her by the British
and Foreign Sailors’ Society.
War-correspondent Villiers says the
French generals are the worst-dressed men in
the armies, and by way of proof he shows
some famous ones he has filmed. They
exceeded my most ragged anticipations. One
of them moved about in sagging overalls
that a racing motor-cyclist would be ashamed
to own. It is the proud boast of a famous
French caricaturist that he made a notori-
ously untidy general spruce up by drawing
him as he stood —his dreadful trousers bath-
ing his ancient boots in unctuous folds.
It seems to be different in Egypt. “This
place eats money,” a very prominent Aus-
tralian officer wrote to his wife a while ago.
“If you want to know men (and you can’t
do much unless you do know them) you
have to entertain; and that’s a hair-raising
business.” Suppose, for a change, they close
Shepheard’s and the Continental to officers,
from generals right down, and open them to
Billjim and his n.c.o’s.
From our erring Adelaide sister: —
The Red Cross Society is stretching out its hand to
men who can’t enlist but want to help finish the
Kaiser. A men’s section of the Cross has been formed,
and is being extended throughout the State by local
mayors and chairmen of district councils. The
School of Mines, timber merchants and owners of
workshops are willing to give what help they can,
and ambition is being stirred by tales of the glori-
ous achievements of certain amateur carpenters in
Melbourne. Anyone who has been to a military hos-
pital will realise what a boon a deck-chair can be
to a convalescent. But I must say that nothing
would bribe me to sit in chairs built by some
amateurs.
The City Council is ringing itself up on the tele-
phone about the noises of motor-vehicles, and lovers
of the quiet life are hoping for the best. The hoot- %
ing, crashing machines rip through the streets like
mad iron elephants, and gravestones shake when
they bolt past the dear departed.
Walkerville is still accumulating funds to buy a
motor-ambulance or an aeroplane, or perhaps it is a
field-manicuring station. A “continental” in the
Herbert Phillips garden t’other evening added a
cheque to the fund.
Colonel Dean and Major Baker are both with us
again—the latter after two trips to Egypt. The
first took him on to Gallipoli, where he was badly
wounded; and the second was on transport duty.
Colonel Dean had the bad luck to get ill just after
he reached Gallipoli, and he had to endure a long
convalescence in England before he started home.
Monday’s Oakbank races were viewed through the
rain by the leisured and the loafered. The deluge
started just about setting-out time, and only the
fanatical racegoers arrived in goloshes at the drip-
ping picnic.
Forestry is booming, and Premier Vaughan is
bemoaning the dearth of trained men so that it
cannot boom louder. Meanwhile we tell ourselves
that we lead the slow procession. At Kuitpo, where
5000 acres have been set aside for the purpose, ex-
perimental work is going on, and Hugh Corbin runs
a School of Forestry at the University. Now two
cork trees at Wirrabara are claiming the limelight.
They were planted about 30 years ago, and are pro-
ducing such valuable “crops” that extensive plant-
ing is to be started. (As you know, dear, cork-
culture is a sort of mania with me.)
News has come from England of the death of
Margaret Symon, sister of Josiah, K.C. It was only
about three weeks ago that the death was cabled of
her sister Esther, with whom she lived.
Rear-Admiral Creswell was here for the Society of
St. George dinner, at which President Peake pre-
sided. The Governor, the Chief Justice, the Premier
and Owen Smyth fired off inspiring platitudes. The
big patriotic fixture of the week was Anzac Day, and
the official service drew a big crowd to Victoria
Square.
The engagement is trumpeted of A. H. Whetham,
of the A.1.F., to the second daughter of the J. R.
Edwardses, of Medindie. He is an Englishman whose
people are connected by marriage with the Duncans
of this State.
The Glaciarium girls are fastening their
skates for the slithers and bumps of winter.
The old Ice House opened last week with a
snap, and all the girls pa works for are
just dying to have a good go as soon as the
fussing of Anzac Week is finished.
Street-collecting days are a joy to those
unlucky flappers who are usually fenced in
bv social barbed-wire entanglements put up
by mother. A friend of mine overheard one
indiscreet little beauty boast that she had
arranged 14 “meets” while trotting about
on patriotic pleasure.
The Northern Territory seems to have a
clear call for the White Australian who
knows it. Frank Brown, Louis Esson’s
half-brother, who wandered thereabout first
with Professor Spencer and later on jobs
of his own, is hearing the call again and is
presently going north with his young wife.
After the honeymoon these two settled on a
tame Victorian farm. But the tame farm
is sold; it didn’t shout to them above a
whisper.
L’Avenir —the beautiful white Belgian
sailing ship which visited here before the
war with naval cadets —has blown into Mel-
bourne again and is loading wheat for South
Africa. Corneillie, the former commander,
is on war service now, as are all the cadets
who have not fought their last fight. As an
emergency cargo boat L’Avenir has toned
down its conspicuous training-ship white-
ness. In happier days it used to look like a
wedding-cake right up to the little pencilled
spars against the sky.
Mrs. Pearce, wife of our gentle Defence
Minister, has just returned from Westralia
with a niece, Marjory Truscott, who is young
enough to spend a couple of hours each day
learning typewriting and shorthand, until it
is time to fare forth with Auntie to the func-
tion for the day.
Mrs. Falkiner, mother of all the racing
Falkiners, left £130,000 very nicely divided.
After fixing up her sons and daughters in a
way that will save them worrying about
tram fares for all time, generous legacies are
handed on to the grandchildren. She also
made the finest provision on record for an
array of nieces and nephews. The old lady
had a fine head for figures and a big heart.
Her will proves it.
The button girls were sent out plainly
labelled on Anzac Day. Formerly they were
marked with a specially-trimmed button ; on
this occasion they were given green card-
board placards like race tickets with their
names written in full across the face. You
should have seen how carefully the labels
were displayed on their modest bosoms when
a nice boy was buying.
Sara Lewis, secretary of the female
branch of the Pub-hands’ Union, has been
elected a delegate of the National Council
of Women. Because the pub and caterer
girls are members of a trades union, allegedly
‘‘dominated by the Political Labor Council,”
the application of Miss Lewis’s society for
affiliation was opposed by Mrs. Vial, of the
Women’s Fashionable League, and a few
others. But Dr. Edith Barrett took up the
case for the union, and Mrs. F. G. Hughes,
president of the Fashionable League, unex-
pectedly distinguished herself by doing like-
wise, and on a vote Miss Lewis was re-
ceived into the august company by 24 ayes
to 18 noes. Thereupon the 24 ayes
applauded loudly and the chariot of progress
rolled forward. For a long time, in a polite
but persistent manner, the new delegate t,.
been educating hotel- and restaurant keener,
club-committees, supper-contractors ala
such 14-hours-a-day sweating-exnerts nQ
knowledge of something like a fair thing"
and the results have lately begun m ’
that the effort was worth while. 8 But inT'
been a hard and bitter struggle, with a lot "f
beery breath and vermilion languall
obstructing the w r ay to victory. age
Now that approaching winter chills the
silken toes of the active and unwed' the
poor things are agitating for patriotic
dances at which they can get warm for the
Empire. Surely if the careful feeder,
help the Flag with their teeth at patriotic
dinners, and noble-minded card-gamhle,
help to baffle the Hun with bridge the
young and graceful might be allowed to
help Britain to the last man and the W
schottische.
Sylvia Tattle, the South Yarra beauty who
lately adopted the nom-de-marriage of Webb
has written a burlesque, “Flossie Fetch-
grace’s Footlight Fever,” which is to be
played for patriotic purposes at a Fink Pekoe
at the Austral Salon on May 11. Sylvia as
Flossie, will have her newly-acquired doctor-
husband for leading man.
Would you like a diamond ring? Three
magnificent ones have been presented for a
patriotic raffle prize to Eduard Lauwers
Consul-General for Belgium, and tickets are
only a shilling each. Country gamblers who
want to help Belgian and Australian
wounded may send for tickets to “Ivosmin-
sk.v, The Block, Melbourne,” and they can
write and ask their city girl-friends to in-
spect the rings through Kosminsky’s win-
dow. Every shilling goes to the funds, the
anonymous donor defraying all expenses.
On Anzac Day there was a great tree-
planting in the Domain, when a little army
of Gallipoli veterans turned out to honor
each battalion represented. Senator Pearce
and his wife and the Gaud Mayoral pair
helped things along, while the populace stood
about on the damp grass outside rope-lines
and cheered at the proper intervals. The
place selected was the rise in the gardens
behind the South African Memorial, within
cooee of the military headquarters on St
Ivilda-road. Bunting fluttered up the path
leading from the roadway and twined round
gum saplings. Yet on this Australian day.
above all others, somebody forgot to hoist
the Australian flag, and it had to be burrowed
for in a barrow piled with odds and ends.
Pearce made a speech and then slapped out
a handful of potted earth into his palm to
prop up his wife’s tree. Somebody else
held the lady’s old-gold velvet cloak while
she did her bit of gardening. Then the
Gaud Mayor planted a good Australian gum.
A soldier reverently guarded the mayoral
umbrella ; but Hennessy kept his own silk
hat. His dame, all in pretty fawn shades,
pink roses and tearful smiles, planted
a Murray cypress—one of those beautiful
weepy trees like a willow. Mrs. James, of
the Overseas, also performed. So did
General McNichol, and his fellow Anzacs
looked on admiringly. McNichol became a
general on Anzac Day. He was a colonel
when he braved everything and “walked the
skyline” in lost Gallipoli. A small son
hugged dad’s overcoat during the turn.
Cronin, the horticultural guardian of the
Domain, waved his arms over the plantation
as if in blessing, and vowed that the trees
would have every care. While all this was
going on two or three Overseas women made
£4O or so with Anzac copper medals.
Reg Wykeham, who has faced limelight
on a hundred stages, is on final leave. The
most touching farewells of this hardened
bachelor are being said to his bulldog
“Billy,” who has failed to enlist.
A pretty, blonde danseuse in the “So
Long, Letty,” co. is suing for divorce from
a leading member of Marlow’s panto, crowd.
Next meeting of Melbourne Divorce Court
will be spiced with theatrical interest, it
seems, and one of the suits will have au
anti-German moral to it. But there s no
actress in that case.
The local Sliakspearians put back their
tercentenary rejoicings till May, and help?
to Anzac with all their might. They boiled
over in a fancy-dress procession and ■ a ®

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Musketoon”: Growing on Bowman’s
property at Toogong, near Forbes (N.S.W.), are
what we all reckon the largest pear-trees in the
State. They were planted over 60 years ago by a
man name o’ Cody, and are 60ft. high and Bft. Tin.
round the girth. Although of such age and unpruned
for a long time they produce plentiful fruit of flue
flavor.
QUITE PRIVATE.
SHE (who dreads meningitis microbes) : “It's not that I wouldn't kiss you, but think of
the attendant dangers."
HE: “Oh, that’s all right. I’ve just given him five shillings to keep away."
“Longy”: Help me to stagger up the stairs
under the weight of exhibit A. At Warneton
(N.S.W.) a swamp dried up this past summer for the
first time within memory of the oldest Ananias for
,
miles around. Making pies in the mud, was found
an outsize in eels. He taped 10ft. 6in. from the tip
of his tail to his venerable whiskers, and went 15in.
round the waist. Don’t ask me his weight, for the
scales shied at sight of him.
“Axehandle” : “Flinderino” (B. 23/3/T6)
can take it from me that snakes do possess the
power of fascination. Was riding through timber
along a sheep pad and noticed a half-grown hare
crouching on the grass at the end of a log. Slowly
appproaching the creature was a sft. black snake
with his head six inches from the ground. He
glided within an inch of the hare’s face and then
began sliming the menu. I was so indignant at
these untidy habits that I corrected them with the
double of a stockwhip. The hare, still in a crouch-
ing position, was quite dead. Fright. Another
time I nearly tripped over a fowl which was stand-
ing at the corner of a yard with wings drooped and
beak on the ground. Less than two inches from
the bird’s nose was the ugly head of a big tiger
snake. Killed the crawler with a heavy leader out
of S. M. Herald and the hen left with a cackle of
relief.
* * * *
“Agricola”: Who lias been swinging on
the limb of “D.F.” (B. 30/3/’l6) while giving him
the information that bloodhounds had been turned
loose on the Upper ’Bidgee to browse on dingoes,
and that instead they had crossed with them, and
produced a ferocious half-breed? For a start the
bloodhound is not a speedy beast, and a dingo pur-
sued by one would simply insert himself into a
hollow log, and from the orifice pass unreliable
remarks upon the canine’s maiden aunt. I’ll tell you
what really did happen. Some years ago certain
squatters in that section of N. S. Wales procured a
number of staghounds (very different from blood-
hounds), and used them for hunting dingoes. Being
very fast, the strangers could easily catch a dingo,
unless he found shelter quickly. I have seen a stag-
dawg throw a dingo six feet into the air as he
seized him. But at certain seasons the hounds were
liable to treat the lady dingoes with such courtesy
and consideration that the following seasons saw
a good many litters of half-castes. These and
their descendants are now playing up Old Henry, as
mentioned by “D.F.’’
* * * *
“Nick Bottom” : When “Yarrum” and
“Leo Lear” have done swapping lies about monster
land eagles, kindly let me say a word or two
about their cousins who get a living out of the
water. A pair of these birds have made their
home on Stott’s Island* Tweed River (N.S.W.),
and are known by name to every fisherman in those
waters. “Big Ben” is the larger of the pair and
a noble bloke he is. I have never been able to
get close enough to measure him from tip to tip,
but I would say that his wing measurement doesn’t
fall much short of eight feet. What particularly
took my fancy about Ben was not his great size
but his tameness. I have seen him swoop down
under the very tuck of a fishing-boat and seize a
meshed mullet as the net was being taken aboard.
Then he would flap calmly away to his eyrie where
Mrs. Ben awaited him. I have never seen the
pair hunting together, and it is very seldom that
Mrs. Ben is seen looking for a crust. She’s got
i he old man too well trained for that.
“Oro”: “Severn” cannot know much
about Bushimaiwa to speak of him as the last great
chief of Papua. A great chief has never existed in
Pa I JUa - Bushimaiwa is still smudging the landscape,
but has had no power for a good few years. At his
best or worgt he was chief only of his own small
locality. As for his alleged 30 wives, he may have
got through that many in his time, but I will wager
a betel-nut to a cocoanut husk that he was never
able to muster that number in one mob.
THE RUSH OF WEALTH.
OLD LADY: “I am going to give you threepence, and I hope you will make good use of it."
TIRED TOMKINS : “Lady, your noble contribution propounds a difficult problem, raisin’
the question of retirin’ from business, or blowin’ in the amount on a rest cure."
“Mulga”: Here’s another peculiar death
that a horse had to put up with on a Queensland sta-
tion. We had completed the bore, with the excep-
tion of fixing the regulating gauge valve, and as
this would not be to hand for a few days, camp
was shifted to the new bore 23 miles away. When
the valve came to hand two of us rode over to' fix
it on, and found at the bore that a station horse
had got its near fore-leg jambed in the casing. I
had to ride over to a fencing camp five miles away
to procure an axe to cut the limb off in order to
shift the carcase.
* * * *
“Barb”: The busliman’s perversion of
words is interesting. “Coolibah” (B. 23/3/’l6) men-
tions the coastal bullocky’s “Flindozy” (for Flin-
dersia), and writes of splitting timber with the
paling “throw.” Always in the bush I have heard
it called throw, but lately in a hardware catalogue
I saw the word printed “froe.” Who’s wrong? The
old Tassy bushmen of 30 years ago always spoke of
“carting” a tree, the cut being called front or back
carf. The majority of bushmen I have met on the
mainland and Maoriland, however, used the word
“scarf,” which I took to be correct, and smiled at
the Speck splitters’ corruption of the term. But on
hunting it up I found “kerf” to be the English
word for cut by axe or saw, from the Anglo-Saxon
“cyrf.” In parts of England they would, doubtless,
pronounce this “karf” (as in Darby for Derby), and
I gave a cheer for the old Tasmanians. “Scarf” is
correct when applied to carpenters’ cutting for
joining timber.
* * * *
“M.G.” : My father built the first pis 6
house at Wagga Wagga (N.S.W.). Mud walls on a
foundation of pine saplings were already common;
also ordinary “wattle and dab.” Our place was
built of red clay damped and rammed in movable
boxes. There were 10 rooms, including kitchen, and
it stood on the Bomen-to-Wagga road when Bomen
was the terminus of the Southern railway line. Built
for a hotel, it was let to one Tewkesbury, father
of Pearson W. Tewkesbury, the Melbourne mining
man. The house stood for years and was finally
'burned down, somehow. Part of the walls, thirty
years old, still stand. From Wagga my father went
to Broken Hill to revolutionise building, offering
pise instead of hot iron and costly wood. The scheme
was a failure, owing to the salt in the earth taking
the rain as it fell. Dry climate is no safeguard and
wet no danger. It all depends on the clay, the
eaves, and the prevailing direction of the rain. In
Paraguay, with a rainfall of feet in the year, there
are walls that must be a hundred years old, and jno
cement of any kind was used in them. The grass
eaves overhang well, to protect the upper part of the
wall, and the lower part is plastered over with fresh
clay, mixed with horse droppings and cut grass, as
it loses its surface. Walls may be two or three
feet thick and 10 or 12 feet high. About Casterton
(Vic.), also a rainy climate, sod walls are sometimes
made. These are not worked and beaten like pis 4.
Mud bricks are occasionally used there, and without
verandahs. When a Paraguayan builds, he uses very
strong corner posts and beams of wood that will not
rot, and which resists white ants. The frame up, he puts
on the roof. That done, he gets twiggy branches and
makes more or less a thin hedge of them between the
corner and the door and window posts. An Austra-
lian’s first impression of them is: “A bit of brush to
keep out the cows!” When the brush is dry, a
few blobs of mud appear in it. The Australian is
surprised; then he concludes “Swallows building!”
Next day the brush is as full of lesser blobs as a
nutmeg grater of holes. Then Australia realises it
is “a Blanky Wall!”
* * * *
“Twyford” : “A G.R.” asks for a method
for destroying weevils in grain. Use carbon bisul-
-phide. With small quantities of grain the fumi-
gation is usually done in tanks. For the treat-
ment of large quantities in bins or elevators the
Harker fumigating machine could be used. By
means of this machine the vapor is distributed
evenly throughout the grain to be treated, the
washed and cool waste gases of combustion from
any boiler or furnace being used as a conveying
medium. These gases being very low in oxygen

“G.T.”: The weevil does not eat his way
into the grain. He bores out. 1 will back him as
an under-water champion. Barley before being
spread in the malthouse is soaked up to 48 hours,
and within half an hour after the grain has been
taken from the water and spread, thousands of
weevils may be seen having a G.N. Steeplechase over
the grain up the walls and along the ceiling. The
little chap is also a long-distance pedestrian, and 1
know' of at least one occasion when an army com-
posed of some thousands decided to hold a church
parade, and paid a visit to the Australian Church in
Flinders-street, Melbourne. Their camp was in a
malthouse in the neighborhood. The visitors proved
a source of annoyance to the congregation, especially
the female portion. However, give the weevil his
due—he is not a biter. I have met only one person
who said he was, and that was an old malster who
used to say that weevils were the only things he saw
when he was in the d.t.’s.

THE PEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now, neither Smithers, Jones nor I,
Nor Robinson, nor Brown,
Desired to hear the loyal boasts
Of the worst Pest in town.
When Robinson drew near the bar
We heard this Jiggers brag:
“I’ve cheered to-day, till I am dry,
For Freedom and the Flag!”
The barmaid set the glasses out
With many noisy clinks;
But Robinson put money down
And firmly said: “Four drinks!”
“We’ll spend the blood m all our veins,”
The Pest said next to Brown ;
But, in his turn, Brown turned his back
And planked two shillings down!
“The British breed will show supreme,
As it has done of yore! ”
So Jiggers put the case to me.
I said: “I’ll owe for four!”
And next of heroes spoke the Pest,
And raised a loyal hat;
But Jones produced four humble trays,
Six coppers and “a sprat.”
A new plan then struck Jiggers’ mind.
He butted in once more:
“From Britain we hear many lies
To bolster up this war!
“1 don’t think all this British bluff
Is really justified;
There’s quite a lot that might be said
Upon the German side!”
There came a sudden whirl of storm,
A moment snatched from Hell;
And Freedom and the barmaid shrieked
When Peter Jiggers fell!

“Operating the wonderful
‘Graduola’ device, which gives
perfect control over the tone of
the instrument
The Success of the
AEOLIAN
VOCALION
is instantaneous.
The moment its first musical tones strike the ear do you
recognise new, fresh born, living qualities of tone, wistful
and sweet and silver pure. It is magical! The subtle
charm of the singer’s voice, the distinctive character of
its instrumental tones, leaves no room for doubt; here
is perfect reproduction at last.
The Exclusive Features of the Vocalion
are the result of many years research by the world’s
leading acoustic scientists. By a unique system of
resonators forming the Symphonic Horn, all tones are
reproduced with that characteristic faithfulness that gives
the performance a touch of livingness equalled only by the
artists themselves. The Graduola makes the music your own ; you may vary the
expression, introduce tone shading and accents as you choose. Yon supply the personal
element which vitalises the interpretation adds the interest of novelty.
An Invitation
We are anxious that all music-lovers shall know by personal experience what the
Vocalion can do. We cannot translate into words its tonal qualities. We therefore invite
you and your friends to visit Pianola Hall between 9 a.m. and 5 p.ui. and hear it played.

"F.D.”: The high priest of all smells is
one distilled by the abos. on the Tally River and
thereabouts in N. Queensland. This scent is a by-
product from black brother’s primitive process of
making a mummy. In the great scrub when any
nig. of great importance dies he is mummified. For
a few days after he passes hence he lies in state,
and strange and weird rites arc performed amid
loud lamentations. The gins usually batter them-
selves on the head with sticks and gash themselves
with broken glass, to the accompaniment of varie-
gated howls. After mourning the departed brother
he is placed on a sort of staging a few feet from the
ground and a fire is lit beneath him. He is kept
there, and toasted and turned and sweated until all
the juice is out of him and nothing but skin and
bone left. Then he is packed up and becomes part
of the stage effects *>f the tribe. While the toasting
process is going on the gravy that drops from the
carcase is collected, and the bucks mb it well into
their bodies, the head, which has previously had
coatings of various substances from iguana fat to
beeswax, receiving special treatment. After a week
or so of this anointing process the black man
fancies he has acquired all the virtues of the
departed. They don’t improve him much, but it’s
the best the departed can do. The relative has at
any rate acquired the most appalling smell to be
found on land, in the heavens above or the sea
below. He leaves a dark green aroma behind him
in the scrub for days after he has passed by, and
when he sidles up to cadge tobacco he brings a
perfume with him that stinks like the legacy of
Iscariot.

“Barcoo”: The Chinaman has a good
word for the crow, and when procurable on John's
big feast day—-his New Year —the dark fowl vies
with the roast duck and the juicy sucking-pig on the
menu. As a boy who was handy with the gun, I
have vivid remembrances of stalking the elusive bird,
which was negotiable at the Chow’s vegetable gar-
dens at a bob. On one occasion, fortified by a
couple of fingers of Chinese brandy, I tasted a piece
of the poultry. The result was a revelation.
The flesh was dead easy, and even now the
“game” flavor of the bird appeals to my palate.
The natural prejudice against all cannibalistic and
carrion-eating things causes the feeling of repulsion
against eating the crow, but the dirty duck and the
slush-scoffing pig can take points from his gills
about choosing fodder.
* * * *
“Sliprails”: At Waikaka (ALL.) a flock
of Border Leicester ewes averaged 200 per cent, of
lambs, every ewe bearing twins. All the lambs are
doing well. What’s the best reply to that lot?
* *• * *
“Te Pana”: I’ve lately been supping a
canned mystery branded “clam chowder,” soldered
up in America. It's good. I want to know if the
clam of the tropics, that mighty sliell-fish, measuring
as much as 15ft. from tip to tip, is the particular
ingredient, or is it the giant mussel that burrows in
the sand on the nor’-west coast of Maoriland. The
natives call that fellow “toheroa” and the stranger
names it clam.
* * * *
“Phillip” : “Pick’s” (B. G/4/’I6) swarms of
black fowl over the N.S.W. South Coast are mutton-
birds returning south to the Bass Strait islands and
Tasmania. About November 26 each year they leave
“ WHO’S LOOKING FOR SUB-
MARINES?”
these islands and travel north to the Victorian and
N. S. Wales South Coast headlands to nest. The
size of the clouds of these birds on the wing is
almost beyond belief. They arrive generally at
about dusk at the rookeries. The egg is laid "in a
sand-burrow about four feet in. The parents sit the
egg till hatched, when they clear out and leave the
chick to live on its own fat. The old birds return
in March to escort the youngster south, and this
home-going is what “Pick” witnessed. It is the
first flight the young bird has had, and this accounts
for the numbers dropping exhausted. A full-grown
mutton-bird is about the size of the domestic pigeon,
but measures some 2ft. Bin. tip to tip, is soot-black
in color, and its egg is equal in size to a goose egg.
A WARNING. TO THE CROWN.
“Eh, boss, what you doing longa Mary?”
Mcasurin' her, Billy that 's all right; police hare to measure all blacks now for
Govment clothes.”
"You tell Missa Gubment getting too plumy familiar, mine tinkit.”
“Hay : How is this for the bad-crop
championship? Saw a cocky on Yorke Peninsula
(S.A.) navigating an old-time stripper across his
paddock with the door of the machine open. As he
rounded up the few ripe heads of wheat the stripper
sowed the entire harvest as seed for next year’s crop.
The rough-and-ready seeding operation was completed
when the farmer dragged an implement called a
cockv’s devil over the land (a devil is a kind of 12ft.
wide scarifier). If no rain fell during the autumn
months lie . would probably repeat this performance
next harvest-time. Yet some people say farming
doesn't pay!
* * * *
“Bad Australian” : If the door isn't shut
a word with “Montalex” (B. 25/11/’15),t0 whom be
peace and the sparkle of the long ’beer.
Supposing he and I were playing a
friendly game of whisky-poker at Jose
Fernandez’s saloon over the road, and
that the guns were on the table or in
the players’ clothes, and that “Montalex”
played a card which I was darned well
sure I hadn’t dealt him, what would be
likely to happen to him while he was
pulling the slide of his auto, back to get
the first cartridge into the barrel, or
fumbling with the safety catch if the
cartridge was already in? (We don’t
worry about safety catches at Jose’s —we
just carry the gun with the striker on an
empty chamber, and the first pull brings
the cylinder round and looses her off.)
And supposing that by some streak of
luck “Montalex” lived long enough to
loose off his first shot and didn’t get the
target, and supposing, further, that the
empty shell, or part of it, jambed in the
barrel, what use would his box of tricks
be in the face of the enemy steadily pump-
ing lead into him at every pull of the
trigger? But why labor the question?
The auto, is a fraud even in its name.
When it can be started off scratch by
simply pulling the trigger like the Colt
it may lay claim to the name. But when
the operator has to carry a grappling-iron to haul
back the slide and a corkscrew to extort jambed or
“busted” shells, a bar of common yellow soap has
almost as much claim to the title.
“Jack Sommers”: The desert sheep of
these parts (Western Frontier, Egypt) is a gastro-
nomical marvel. During raids he is driven in from
his luscious grazing areas of pure rock and dust,
travels for miles without water, and when provided
with water and hefrse-feed refuses to fall-to. The
regimental cook may' be heard imploring the quarter-
master to “put a stone on them blanky carcases, for
the last lot blew away.” Thirty pounds dressed is
a heavy-weight beast; but, in spite of all, this
astonishing animal has time to put a little store of
fat on his tail. As for black goats—well, even
aboliars have a limit to their credence.
“Silas Snell”: I see that Spence, M.H.R.,
orating to the Melbourne A.N.A., asserted that “the
bullock-driver is not a man who swears. He is
quiet.” Then the bull-puncher has changed since
my time in the wilds. I once lived in a district near
Ballarat where almost interminable strings of teams
passed with timber and firewood for the mines, and
of all the spirited conductors of Blackboy and Polev
only one was a quiet man. This chap, a tall, red,
raw-boned miscreant, carried a terrific lash on the
end of an eight-foot pole, with which he could knock
the fur in clouds from Spot’s haunches. But he
never swore. The others jagged the atmosphere with
lightning streaks of profanity; Big Steve said
nothing. But an undersized, half-caste aborigine who
trotted by his side made up for his silence. Any
movement of Steve’s whip was a signal to Jackv, who
broke into a sort of frenzy of cursing, and blasted
the offending cow’s uncle with an electric cloud-
burst of invective. One day Brother Best, who was
stoking at the Hard and Band, asked Big Steve:
“Why do ’ee keep they boy Jacky to swear for ’ee?”
Steve turned upon him with grave reproach. “I
am a godly man,” \\«s all he said.

‘ Billy B.” : Here’s another Wild Colonial
song, or as much as the venerable ex-bushranger
could recollect of it:—
Oh, I’m a jolly lad,
Though my fortune it’s sad,
And if ever I get luck 1 should wonder.
For I’ve spent all my brass
In the bottom of the glass,
And now I’m commissioned for to plunder.
Chorus —
For it’s all through the grog
The jolly, jolly grog,
Oh, it’s all through the grog and tobacco.
I have an old shirt,
It’s the only one I’ve got,
And the collar is burnt to a cinder.
If I don't get any more
I will never have a store,
So I'll save this old shirt to make tinder.
And it's all through the grog, etc.

“Rolling Stone”: “Boro Belle” (B.
13,4/’l6) mentions the canegrowers’ “record” shout
of 110. In the Boer War time King Dick Seddon had
a train-load of departing swaddies on the way to
port in Maoriland. At a station, whilst the engine
was watering, Dick suggested a stronger lotion for
the train’s freight. The shout cost him £9 ss. 6d •
so that at sixpence per dose 371 throats were moist-
ened.

“J.”: Concerning Mrs. Koala’s family.
The abos. who have seen that lady nursing more than
one infant prove nothing. Neither Lucas and Le
Souef nor I ever denied that Mrs. K. may at times do
a bit of baby farming; and advertisements in the
Gumtops Gazette for “kind lady wanted to adopt
infant are not uncommon. The next Abo. writer
who butts into this controversy with a tale that he
las seen Norman Lindsay’s pet nursing two, three
or more children will be treated disrespectfullv unless
he has inspected the babies’ birth-certificates."

“Ilay”: “Waudi” (B. G/4/TG) has noticed
that black brother appears to have a nreimli
against caves as dwelling-places. Correct S
doesn t like dwelling-places at all—that is f 0 ” "
fixed ones—but he does make use of caves i n
McDomrtll Ranges, Centralia, are many l a^0 cavT
and within them were found some of the best abor ’
inal rock paintings and carvings in the continent
The black artist evidently liked to execute k
masterpieces in places where wind and weather could
not dim their beauty, so he used caves as convenien
art-galleries. In the Cave Range, Narracoorte (S \
the petrified remains of a blackfellow were found o’
a ledge of rock. He had either used the cave as a
place to die in or his people had carried him there
The limewater dripping from the roof had turned the
body completely into stone. An iron railin- w -i
placed around it, but that did not prevent an "enter
Prising showman from abstracting the curiosity a<
money-making proposition. A blackfellow in the hi
terior used to relate how he and his mother were out
foraging in the bush when they caught sight of the
first white men they had ever seem—three horse*,
men. According to Micky, he and ma were nearly
terrified out of their wits, and took refuge in a cave
till the terrible animals were a safe distance awav
They thought each horse and rider was one strange,
unholy beast.

“T. Asli”: Somebody in the Abo. pages
shouted a warning against the black spider with the
red freckle on his back, but it came too late for me.
Applied ammonia. Pain eased for about ten minutes.
Then I was seized with a severe ache in each groin,
which, in spite of rubbing and hot fomentations'
continued for four hours. Pain suddenly shifted to
knees, and was too severe for sleep. Twenty hours
after the bite the legs and feet from knees to toes
exuded cold water. The pain and the cold per-
spiration gradually passed down to the feet until, at
the fifth day, the toes were the only parts affected.
During the five days and nights I had mere snatches
of sleep. The only remedy I tried was brandy, which
I could not procure until the third day. Drank a
lot of it to induce sleep. It failed, but it increased
the flow of water from my legs, and by this means
I got rid of the poison.

“Ilaka”: Here’s a shearer in a class by
himself. He was at the first barbering on Little Valley
station (M.L.), 40 years ago. This year, at the old
address, the veteran pulled up his socks, and on a
board of 12 men, with a cut of 19,000, jammed 1600
through the porthole—2o above the average.
ONLY A RUMOR.
“What’s all this talk about you enlisting,
Pcrcy?”
"Don’t be alarmed. Maysc, it’s only talk.’

“Sooty Tern” : I am able to inform “Pick
that the flight of birds along the coast mentioned
by him are the familiar mutton birds (sooty tern)
of Bass Straits islands. They are one of the tastes
flying birds in the world and can easily leave 1®
miles an hour behind in a gale of wind. They aie
at the Bass Straits address for seven months in t e
year, leaving in autumn and returning in spring
but where they go to winter I don’t know. I' ol
have I ever met a lybody who could tell me.

WORN-OUT LOOK OF THE
KIDNEY MARTYR
Here is the face of a typical kidney sufferer —puffiness and lines under the eyes, showing
that the kidneys are weak or disordered—a tendency to dropsy. Look of agony in the
eye, a sharp, sickening, stabbing pain in the back or joints, which never ceases day nor night.
The tightly-drawn mouth is that af a man resigned to his fate, thinking he is incurable.
The general appearance of the face spells bodily weakness and irritability. You probably
know many such kidney sufferers whose faces look just the same as this man’s does.
If you suffer from kidney trouble in any form, rheumatism, gout, sciatica, lumbago,
stone, gravel, backache, or any such symptoms as headache, sediment in urine, bad taste in
the mouth, burning sensation at neck of bladder, puffiness under the eyes, be sure weakened
kidneys are at the bottom of it all.
The kidneys act as filters in the body, and make impure blood into good, pure, healthy
blood, and if your kidneys do not do their work properly you are being slowly poisoned:
That acid poison is the cause of the pain. I)e Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills strengthen
the kidneys and drive the poisonous pain-causing acid right out of the system. Every
suffering reader of this paper can prove for himself, with just one or two doses of De Witt’s
Pills, that they do touch the weak spot —the kidneys and bladder.
To cure kidney trouble of any kind you must positively get rid of the cause—the
poisonous uric acid. To do this a real remedy must pass through the Sidneys and bladder
and not through the bowels, as most Kidney Pills do. When you see the urine change into
a muddy bluish color —the feature which distinguishes De Witt’s Pills from all others—you
know, beyond all doubt, that they have put their healing touch on the right spot —the kidneys
and the bladder. De Witt’s Pills are wonderful little pills, for they go straight to the
kidneys, then to the bladder, that is the reason why you get such amazingly quick relief
every time. A permanent cure follows in almost every case. Don’t take someone's word for
it " Pro\e it for yourself.

The Inky Way.
“Seven Bells”: Hal Gye has a tale of
how he outwitted the “brutal and licentious
soldiery”—the same cheerful lads whose
brothers in Egypt and Gallipoli so admired
Gye’s illustrations in “The Sentimental
Bloke.” Gye lives on the Essendon line,
over which passes a huge and at times
uproarious khaki traffic to and from Broad-
meadows. Physically Gye would fit into a
nutshell, and it was at some risk that he
entered into an argument with a carriage-
ful of heated infantrymen as to what con-
stituted “a sport.” That Hal was one him-
self was denied with hiccoughs and gesticu-
lations by a bulloek-thewed private, who
put it to the vote of his eight comrades
whether Hal should not be stoushed for his
temerity. With intense gravity and many
precautions to ensure the secrecy of the
ballot, every soldier wrote “Yes” or “No”
on a grubby slip of paper. The result was
even, and Hal, his little heart, as he ad-
mitted, going pit-a-pat, claimed the casting
vote. He got it, and, with diplomacy that
was genius, voted in favor of being stoushed.
This daredevil recklessness so appealed to
the generous giant who was to do the stoush-
ing that he threw up his hands. Then,
bringing them down, he nearly shook Hal’s
fist off in his emotional admiration. “My
oath, talk about sports!” he said —“I never
knew what one was till I met you. Blimey,
you arc a sport!” And there was a new
friendship on the spot.
From one of his old hands: —
John Norton was a curious mixture of ferocity
and kindness, virtues and vices. He was a jggycho-
logical puzzle that he did not himself understand,
and of late years he appeared to be always trying
to run away from the other part of himself. He
was a forgiving boss to his wayward henchmen, but,
like most heavy drinkers, when virtuously inclined he
expected his men to be likewise. “I can do all the
drinking in this establishment,” he would roar;
“and if you keep on neglecting your work, we will
put you on lines. And if that doesn’t cure you, we
will ask you to pass on to some other benevolent
institution. This is a house of limited means and
the beer-engine must be held up occasionally.
There was a curious streak in him which made him
allow himself to be used by parasites and spongers
who wrecked his domestic life. Like most born
journalists he liked to know all that was going
on, and thus he lent his ear to the sneak and the
tale-bearer. David Syme, big man, too, was an
accessible listener to stories affecting office organisa-
tion and discipline; Norton permitted his tattlers
to make mischief in the family dircle, and on occa-
sions when a man is drinking beyond the bounds of
discretion this form of devilry leads to frenzy. And
Norton was all the more frenzied because he despised
the tale-bearers and (occasionally) himself for listen-
ing-

before. Any afternoon at 2.15 you can buy
the “five o’clock edition ’ of the evening
papers. Until recently there were two
afternoon rags, and they suffered from that
tired feeling because they were merely off-
shoots and re-liashes of the two morning
dailies. Also each sheet had an arrange-
ment with the other about everything, from
the kind of ink to be used and the number
of lines of “special sporting” to be set down
to the very minute at which each was to
appear on the streets. But The Sun, pro-
pelled by a, new co. with ideas, dropped from
the clouds, and began to appear half an
hour before the other two. r i hen each
paper started forestalling the other by a few
minutes until the 5 p.m. edition is gradu-
ally working back to 5 a.m.

The recent funeral of the London
Standard shows what a doubtful proposi-
tion the goodwill of a newspaper is. The
Standard was originally owned by a fam-
ily named Johnson, who got rich out of it.
the average profits for many years exceeding
£40.000. Run by a company, it stilly in
1910 managed to make £29,000. Next
year it dropped to £16,000, and then to
£12.000, and when the crash came recently
£lO.OOO was the best bid for the whole con-
cern.

“J.C.” : The death of John Gorst, knight,
inevitably revived the ancient fable about
his printing-press at Te Awamutu having
been annexed by the Maoris, who, so the
story goes, ran the type off into bullets.
The mossy legend has it that Thos. Atkins
was subsequently laid out with slabs of
Government leaders and missionary ser-
mons, and that a lump of moulded-down pica
caps, was fired into the Waikato River gun-
boat Blunderbuss, taking off one side of
Commodore Wiseman’s Crimean whiskers.
Unfortunately the picturesque old com-
munique must go. The Maoris were as
careful with that press and. type as any
pakeha maiden aunt of her gimcrack china.
They carted the plant off to the kainga and
stored it in the meeting-house, and later on
they bullock-drayed it to the M aipa and
canoed it down the Waikato to Havelock,
where they handed the little lot ovei to
trader Andrew Kay, a young Scot, and re-
quested him to return it to Governor Grey.
The last Kay saw of it was when it was
loaded on to a bullock-dray for Auckland.
There it vanishes from history. Kay is
now farming at Parawera and vouches for
this. The sturdy rebels did, however, use
a stray catechism or two, as that made hrst-
chop cartridge-paper. I have tried to dis-
cover the afterwards of that hand-press, but
failed, though I gazed with deep amaze and
reverent air upon a splinted and bescratched
contraption that seemed quite as ancient
not long since when I wandered into Charlie
Mills’s Pelorus Guardian office up in a
backwater of the Marlborough Sounds.
“Seven Bells”: C. J. Dennis is beginning
to make Professors of Poetry in ivied Eng-
lish universities wonder whether, after all,
Douglas Brooke Wlieelton Sladen is the only
Australian poet. The Sentimental Bloke
has fallen into the hands of E. V. Lucas,
author, poet and publisher’s reader, whose
literary judgment has made his anthology,
“The Open Road,” a fountain and a shrine
to those unashamed of admiration for beau-
tiful verse. Lucas, unwitting even that
Den’s first name is Clarence, contributes to
London Star a long and generous apprecia-
tion of the Australian’s work, illumined with
quotation after quotation. Such recognition
as this makes one feel with Henry Lawson
that, after all, “there’s hope, there’s hope
for England,” despite the superior aloofness
of the Athenaeum and the Spectator.
* * * *
“Another P.D.”: Touching the Queens-
land account of a Rockhampton newspaper'
collision between the social col. and the
shipping, I mind me of an Auckland episode.
One morning two long, red-headed men from
Waipu, the Nova Scotian settlement near
Whangarei, scaled the ramparts of an even-
ing newspaper and demanded the blood of
the shipping reporter served up in a haggis.
The trouble was a par. which alleged: “The
s.s. Rob Roy arrived last night from Waipu
with a cargo of pigs and Nova Scotians.”
The barelegged bushmen declined to be com-
forted even when it was explained that the
water-front reporter meant Nova Scotian
potatoes. They departed hissing bagpipe
language through their teeth, and threats to
complain to the Presbytery.
* * * *
“Sancho”: Having failed to serve
the Empire with his petard, A. J. Hampson.
M.H.R. for Bendigo, now endeavors to
serve it with his pen. He would show up
better as a silent patriot. In a correspond-
ence which was given much press publicity
at the time, Hampson tried some months
ago to induce his son to enlist. Precept
failing, he essayed example, and offered his
own services, but was rejected as being over
age. One began to think that he was let-
ting concealment, like a worm i’ th’ bud,
prey on his damask cheek, so silent was he
thereafter. But in the Age of 15/4/1(5 h
burst into song under the heading n f
“Anzac.” A perusal of his effort explains
recent curses in The Bulletin correspond
ence column whenever anyone choose \nzae
as a verse-subject. The Parliamentary
poet’s stanza runs thus 3
I am sitting alone by the camp’s fire glare
With the gum trees nodding, too; ’
And I hear the sound from the Maories’ whare
To the nest where the mopoke flew. ’
“Glare” won’t rhyme with “whare” any
more than “stare” will rhyme with ‘‘lorn '”
There are six more verses of the same sort
with a line of asterisks, suggesting a sub-
editor’s curses, in the midst thereof. The
comp, has interpreted the last word of the
fourth verse to suit himself, with the follow-
ing result: —
In fancy I ask, Is this the shore
Where deeds that o’ershadowed Troy
Around the world for the land that bore
True men without allow?
Other features are stars that “peek and
blink.” and brain-cells that “move and start
to think,” and then this bathos:—
Then bare your head, and let a tear drop fall
For those whose bones are sleeping here:
Australia’s gallant sons who heard the call
In spirit live to conquer and to cheer.
The rest, mercifully, is silence.
* * * *
A roll of honor recently compiled shows
that 1408 British journalists have gone to
the Front to deal with the man who made a
censor necessary. Of this number 65 were
men from overseas. At latest information 55
had been killed, 71 wounded, 11 reported
missing, and 10 decorated for gallantry.
* * * *
“ J.F.H.”: Handed in his last copy, Wil-
liam Jeans, patriarch of the Press Gallery
in the Commons, knocked by a taxicab. He
first entered the gallery in 1863 when
Palmerston was in power, and spent half a
century there, barring three years in Mel-
bourne at the time George Iliginbotham was
making Victorian politics lively with his
denunciations of the House of Fatmen and
their aider and abettor, the “man Rogers” in
Downing-street, permanent head of the Colo-
nial Office. Jeans published a readable vol-
ume of Parliamentary Reminiscences and
was understood to be preparing another.
A PLEA FOR SILENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A naked turnip in a row,
With nothing on except its leaves,
Has nought to do expect to grow.
None worries what the thing believes;
It never votes or strikes or kicks,
I think it has no politics.
A simple hero on a hill,
As bare as Zeus or khaki-clad,
Has nought to do but kill and kill,
And keep on killing foes like mad.
He does not need to fret his heart
When new offensives do not start.
And yet a very simple bard,
Who fain would like a turnip grow,
Must argue daily long and hard,
Proclaiming all he does not know;
And, what is worse a thousandfold,
Must hear all views that grocers hold.
Give me an aeroplane to climb
Above the chatter of the world
That thence each happy bomb of rhyme,
Thought-furnaced, may to earth be hurled,
Or some dark submarine to sink
To depths in which a man may think;
Or trundle up a cask of beer
To some high mountain, clear and sweet,
And stuff some clouds in either ear
To guard me from the mutton’s bleat —
There might I make a song indeed
For all to praise and none to read!
N.S.W.
CURSE O’ MOSES.
THE REJECT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young Willie Smiles wrote pretty verse
Of flowers, and snow, and even worse;
And though he labored half the night,
And issued very limp and white,
The editors he sent his hanks
Of rhyme replied: “Rejected, thanks.”
Then Willie wrote his charming tales,
With fondest hope of ready sales;
His heroines so sweet and fair
Of most amazing virtue were.
But ’twould appear that virtue ranks
As rather slow. “Returned with thanks!”
So Willie made a bonfire tall
Of poems, stories, plays and all,
And went, determined to appear
In military columns here.
But home he came on weary shanks.
’Twas still (eheu!) “Declined with thanks.
VICTORIA.
SNELL.

Indigestion!
Right there is your most important life organ—the breeding
place for germs of dangerous diseases, which, if neglected, may
ruin your whole future life.
At the least pain or sign of any disorder of your digestive
organs, make up your mind quickly and ward off dangerous conse-
quences by taking Chamberlains Tablets for the stomach and liver.
The first dose will give relief, aid digestion, drive away the
cause of your pain, cleanse your bowels, and their. continued use
will restore you to perfect health.
There is no better medicine for Indigestion, Biliousness or Con-
stipation, than
Chamberlains Tablets
Jby The Stomach Liver.
FULL PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT
POSSIBLE FOR EVERY WOMAN!
ANY WOMAN without full bust development lacks the
one essential that creates a perfect appearance. Lack
of proper bust development, hollow cheeks and “salt-
cellars” quickly take from a woman the bloom and
freshness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have
been your lot in so far as natural development is con-
cerned, but science has found a way to correct your
deficiency. Even though you have never been full-
bosomed, and have been attenuated all your life, if you
suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be fully
developed and your weight increased to normal....
There are, to-day, hundreds of women who were once
thin, flat-bosomed, hollow-cheeked, and generally scraggly
in appearance, and suffering the effects of anaemia and
defective digestion, who are now, for the first time in
their lives, healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and
enjoying the full vigor of robust womanhood, as the
result of a few weeks under our wonderful
DR. FALLIERE’S FLESH-FOOD.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its
efficacy is beyond question, and its use is no demand
upon the subject’s time. Many cases have gained up to
six pounds a week, and an increase in bust measurement
up to eight and ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers
relief and development to the thousands of chronically
thin women who have despaired of ever possessing a pre-
sentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food-treatment that
adds weight and permanent development to attenuated
women. Guarantee given in every case accepted.
WHAT A WELL-KNOWN NURSE SAYS.
Manager, “Flesh-Food” Co. Gympie, Queensland.
Hear Sir, —As a nurse I was very interested in your
Flesh-Food treatment, and was greatly surprised at the
wonderful results in my case. When I first wrote to you
I was only skin and hone, and I have good cause to he
thankful that I wrote you for a free sample, for I feel
certain now that I am one of the very best advertisements
you could possibly have, as I am developed in every way
satisfactory to myself, and I have waited a good while to
prove if it was lasting in its effect, and I am now glad to
s.'jj' t' at your splendid treatment has done all you claimed
it would, my weight and measurements being ample.
I am, your gratefully
MRS. E. WING ROVE.
JUST AS WE PROMISED.
Falliere “Flesh-Food” Co. Mt. Gambler, SA,
Dear Sirs, —I am very pleased to tell you of the delightful
results in my case with your splendid treatment. If you
could see me to-day, you would readily realise how much
cause I have to be more than satisfied w T ith the results,
when comparing my appearance with what it was.
I have gained in weight, and my measurements have
increased just as you said they would do, and my health
has improved marvellously.
Many, many thanks for your kind care and attention, and
your splendid remedy, and you can depend upon me to
always recommend its use.
Yours very gratefully,
ELDA PEAKL UNGER.

DID ADD YOU SAID IT WOULD.
Gidginbung,
The Manager, via Temora.
Dear Sir, —I will need no further treat-
ment, as it has done for me all you said it
would do. I have gained the necessary
weight, also bust measurements required,
and my health Is wonderfully improved;
in fact, you would not take me for the
same persotf as I was before using your
remedy.—l am, yours sincerely,
MISS M. HARTUNG.
MORE THAN SATISFIED.
The Manager, Reefton, N.Z.
Dear Sir, —Having been away, I have not
previously replied to your communication,
and am now glad to say that I do not
require any more “Flesh-Food,” as I am
more than satisfied with the result. YTou
really would not know»me now if you had
seen me just before taking the treatment.
Thanking you for your kind services.
Yours truly, CAROLINE FANSELOW.

TEN DAYS
I WILL TELL EVERY REA-
DER OF 1 HIS PAPER HOW
mm
Your Complexion Makes or Mars
your Appearance.
I '-
i
GRACE DUNCAN, former actress, who now offers
to tell women of the most remarkable complexion
treatment ever known.
This great beauty marvel has instantly pro-
duced a sensation. Stubborn cases have been
cured that baffled physicians and beauty specialists
for years. You have never in all your life used or
heard of anything like it. Makes muddy com-
plexions, red spots, pimples, blackheads, freckles,
eruptions vanish almost like magic. No cream,
lotion, enamel, salve, plaster, bandage, mask,
massage, diet or apparatus, nothing to swallow.
It doesn’t matter whether or not your complexion
is a "fright,” whether your face is full of muddy
spots, peppery blackheads, embarrassing pimples
and eruptions, or whether your skin is rough and
"porey,” and you’ve tried almost everything under
the sun to get rid of the blemishes. This wonder-
ful treatment, in just ten days, positively removes
every blemish and beautifies your skin in a mar-
vellous way. You look years younger. It gives
the skin the bloom and tint of purity of a freshly
blown rose. In ten days you can be the subject
of wild admiration by all your friends, no matter
what your age or condition of health.
ALL METHODS NOW

POLITICAL
POINTS
In the P.L.L. Conference the other even-
ing Holman, fighting for his political life,
said that there was no hope of destroying
the I .eg. Council except by democratising it;
and the Government had been steadily doing
that. Simultaneously, or within an hour
or so, Graham, Holman’s Minister of Agri-
culture, was telling another crowd that the
Leg. Council had for the time defeated the
Government’s wlieat-handiing proposals;
but, if necessary, the Government would go
to the country to show “Allen Taylor and
his friends” who were masters. And Allen
Taylor is one of the “democrats” whom
Ilolman and his friend Griffith appointed to
the Council.
RIP VAN STRIKER’S TOPHET.
The amazing success of the Lake Mar-
garet hydro-electric scheme, carried out in
Tasmania by the Mount Lyell Co., has
spurred N. S. Wales to refer a batch of simi-
lar proposals to the Works Committee. One
of the most important of them is a unique
testimonial to Dalgety, the Federal Capital
site which was turned down in favor of an
impossible dust-heap and rabbit-warren in
Sydney’s backyard. The proposal is to put
a dam across the Snowy, 14Sft. high, a mile
below Jindabyne, and the estimate is that
the water so impounded on the swift-running
river will yield 750,000,000 units of power
per annum. A transmission line 210 miles
long will carry current to Sydney. As a
side-line, power may also be taken to the
South Coast; but naturally, the Holman
Government being pledged to decentralisa-
tion, the main thing is to take the goods to
Sydney. How else could the Government
maintain its reputation of breaking every
pledge it ever made?
The annual Easter Conference of the Vie.
P.L.C. rescinded and quietly interred the
clause in the Constitution which, when
passed 111 months ago, disqualified from
membership “any person belonging to
another organisation which selects or lends
support to candidates for public positions.”
The brick was pointed at the Licensed
Victuallers’ Ass., the L.0.L., the Victorian
Alliance and the Catholic Federation, but
it was actually hurled only against the last-
named. It then became apparent to the
P.L.C. that the recoil of the missile was
likely to still further flatten out Labor in
Vic., and as any additional flattening-out
would probably mean interment, retreat was
imperative.
If we don’t do something with the
tariff the chances are we will turn out
actually less stuff after the war than we
are doing now. It looks like that in some
lines, anyhow. Euamelware is one. There
is a factory in Adelaide on which the pro-
prietors (Simpson and Son. Ltd.) swore
before the Inter-State Commission that a
loss of between flO.OOO and £2i>.ooo had
been made; and detailed figures were given.
The co. was on the point of closing down
when the war started; it has been kept
going since then largely on Defence Depart-
ment orders. But it is pretty certain that
the plant will stop as soon as peace is
declared and the Hun mug comes into the
market again.
The latest version of a popular London
lie appears in the Daily Graphic
apropos George Reid’s 72nd anniversary. "As
senior Premier he took the great cause of
Australian Federation up and carried it to
success.” So the man who blocked Federa-
tion up to the eleventh hour and championed
Australian parochialism and provincialism up
to their last ditch, is now the statesman who
took up the great Federal cause and carried
it to success! The man who loaded the dice
and blocked the vote for Federation until he
had won what he thought was a concession
out of the other States! Even Australia, so
short is man’s memory, has forgotten that
the monumental blunderer, pitting his wits
against George Turner’s, came back from the
final conference with a “concession” which
prevented Sydney from ever becoming the
Federal Capital—till the Constitution is
altered, which in that respect it is never
likely to be. Until the parochial Reid
wrung that “concession” from the other
States, the Federal Capital could have been
fixed anywhere within the Commonwealth.
State purchase of private estates for
closer settlements seems to be always tacked
on to a bad smell. The latest sample of the
odor comes from Westralia.
Some years ago, when Frank
Wilson was in power, the Gov-
ernment bought the Avondale
and Bowes estates for £50,000.
Since then the laud has been
split up into blocks and let to
cookies supposed to be specially
qualified to work out their sal-
vation with a little help from
the Agricultural Bank. Now
most of them are threatening
to throw in their alley because
the land w T on’t stand the
charges. The only party that
smiles is the old owner. It w r as
ever so much better to get a
cheque for £50.000 than a pro-
gressive land-tax notice.
The Federal Government now
has on hand enough locally-
tubed serum to deal with all the
meningo-cocci likely to get lively
this winter. The only remaining
requirements for public safety
are a few trifles such as one
health authority for all Aus-
tralia and a full supply of hos-
pitals. It is absurd and uncou-
s’tooshnal of them, of course,
but no disease germs have yet
been discovered that will respect
State frights. Still, the fact
that Australian-made serum has
already been proved to be far more
valuable than the imported article, and less
expensive, is a crumb of comfort for those
who have been agitating for better things.
Some months ago Westralia made it law
that medical practitioners should report all
cases of venereal disease. But the Scaddan
Ministry, while hungry for the credit of
passing the measure, jibbed at incurring
anybody’s disfavor by putting it into effect.
Some Perth people, however, are not going
to be altogether swindled this time; and at
a public meeting a vigilance committee of
practical patriots has been appointed to see
that the Government carries out its own
la w.
Private Enterprise has again handed itself
its walking ticket. “Do things for yourself.”
says the Automobile Club of Victoria ; which,
of course, is just what that dreadful tiger
Sosh says. For a start, the club, tired of
making profits for somebody else, proposes to
run its own insurance policies.
SAVING IT WITH HIS MOUTH.
FLUNKEY: “Message from Australia inquiring when you are going back to the job then
pay you for, sir?"
BIĹY OoZE: " Don't humbug me, man! Can’t you see I’m busy saving the Empire!”
In 1004 Victoria made a timid start to
cope with the white plague, and since then
the death rate, from consumption has de-
creased from 1111 per million to SOS in 1912,
755 in 1913, 724 in 1914 and (Mil in 1915.
On the 1904 basis there would have last
year been 040 more deaths from phthisis
than there were. Thus does the tiger Sosh
snatch citizens from an untimely grave. But
lessons are wasted on the Vic. Government,
otherwise the terrible drain made by menin-
gitis and venereal diseases would be a lot
more seriously considered.
"Melb”: Rider Haggard’s courtesy made
friends of all he met in Melbourne.
Yet there is much criticism of his
ideas. G.-G. Ferguson warmly sup-
ports him, but there is a cautious
note in Gov. Stanley’s voice when
he speaks of repatriation. Stanley
says the endeavor ought to be to
settle the soldier in his former
occupation ; and that’s the right
thing. Most old Victorians remem-
ber the frightful bungles made
through trying to settle unsuitable
people on the land. One result was
wholesale dummyism. But there
is the cry about soldiering unfitting
a man for his former steady job—•
the one that was to be kept for
him. Does it create a farmer? For
my own part I believe that, if it
works any change at all, it will be
rather to unfit men for the slow.

CHAMPION CURE of the WORLD
for BLEEDING PILES. Estab. 189 L
SPORTINA
NOTIONS
Owners living beyond the State borders
got away with a big slice of stake money from the
A.J.C. autumn meeting, and the progeny of the
imported sire triumphed with great regularity, But
on the four days the most triumphant circumstance
in ithe land was MacShortodds, who should at least
be able now to get through the winter without hav-
ing to live on pollard. In 24 races the favorite went
down plunk 20 times. In the two races in which
betting was heaviest rank outsiders were the first to
arrive, and in the four cases in which the favorites
won the wagering was 4 to 1, evens, 5 to 4, 7 to 4.
The win of the bag was enormous, for Ikey and his
clerk formed a regiment a thousand strong. They
will be at the same address again on Saturday to see
if the public has earned a bit more in the mean-
time.
The club parted with £36,726 to owners. No-
where in the world these times is there so much
bullion dangled in front of four-legged animals, and
there is a mighty big chance that it isn’t going to
be dangled hereabouts for all eternity. The biggest
winner was R. Crawford (Vic.), who supplied Prince
Bardolph and took £4334. Eleven other owners
appropriated £lOOO and over.
The Abundance-Fulminate colt Ivandos
galloped from the ruck last week right into the front
rank. Hitherto the animal had never won a race,
though a frequent starter. This time he made a
good showing, in the Cup and annexed the two
lorig-distance ' events, the St. Leger and the
A.J.C. Plate. Kandos is clearly a champion stayer.
In the* St. Leger he had a little luck in the charac-
ter and condition of the field, and though he won
well the performance was nothing to be excited about.
But in the three-mile Plate he was up against a
proved long-winded performer like Ulva’s Isle, and
at. the end of the prolonged trip was galloping right
away from him. At the bend it looked as if Ulva’s
Isle was a certainty, for Kandos was already being
pushed. It didn’t matter. The colt came on
without sign of faltering. The time—smin. 34sec. —
was very moderate. But the race showed the big
fellow’ to be a rare sticker. First and second horses
are owned by brothers, and for the fourth successive
year the winner of the Marathon came from the
Allsop stable.
Some of the best milers in the Common-
wealth had a go for (lie All Aged Stakes w.f.a. at
Randwick, among them Woorak, Brattle, Amata,
Willow Green, Traquette, Quairneta, Eurobin and
Cetigne. Woorak, with 121 b. less than in the Don-
caster, was made an even-money favorite, and this
Hme the little wonder did all that was wanted.
There was nothing able to live with him at the dis-
tance, but opposite the stand Cetigne came with a
gieat run and got within half a length. Woorak
ran the mile in 38. It was a wonderful gallop, but
it seemed a pity that Cetigne didn’t come a tick or
>o earlier and try him out over the last pinch.
What an unlucky horse Giru is! Every
year there seems to be an animal like this, good
enough to beat everything but one or two. At
Randwick Reputation’s gammy leg just stood long
enough for him to snatch the Autumn Stakes from
Foley’s horse, and the Cumberland Stakes would
have been Giru’s if there had been no Ulva’s Isle.
One of these days the hoodoo will be left behind, and
then, when nobody happens to be thinking about it,
Giru will arrive at the right place. Cetigne has
another sort of luck altogether. Perhaps the prepara-
tion he had for distances didn’t do him much good ;
possibly he might have won the St. Leger with a
little nursing ; certainly he had no cause to complain
about luck when he got a clear run along the rails
in the Rous Handicap, and cut down what seemed
a certain winner in La Penna. The official
verdict was a win by a head. It was the shortest
head this writer ever saw.
At Randwick Traquette and Patrobas did
no good. The mare looked well and galloped attrac-
tively, but appears to have lost her brilliancy. The
stable was understood to favor her chances' in the
All-Aged Stakes against Woorak, but she was never
in it. Why the Melbourne Cup winner was travelled
to Randwick is hard to understand. He should have
been having a rest, being very weary and dejected
looking and quite unenthusiastic about the whole
business.
Of the youngsters seen at Randwick three
stand out on their own—Wolaroi, Miss Thana and
Portrina. The colt’s win with 9st. 61b. in the
Champagne Stakes, run in “13,” was an eye-opener.
Whether he will develop into a Derby colt is another
matter. He looks rather too small for that. Miss
Thana, on the other hand, is a fine, big filly, likely
to grow into the best class of racing mare. Portrina
may be anything.^!*?nothing. The certain thing is
that she is infernally speedy at this stage. But
there were severagyyoungsters who, though not win-
ners, are going t<> be better later on; among them
Miss Tressady, Court, Jester, Regularity and Alice
Kenilworth. -A Hitachi, winner of the First Nursery
Handicap and third in the Easter Stakes, and March-
On, winner of the Second Nursery, look likely to
earn more oats —and it is not improbable that some-
thing which ran at the stern may furnish next vear’s
loader.

Among the jumpers the Spire, over the
little obstacle, and El Progresso, over the big coun-
try, are at the top of their class. Queer how few
first-grade steeplechasers are raised in the Common-
wealth. One bobs up in an odd year; the rest are
mostly dull pluggers that jump wi’ deefeculty or
else fall down. The general plan seems to be to first
run a horse off its legs on the flat and then set it
to learn how to get over an obstacle, and, incident-
ally, to start it racing across jumps when only about
half schooled. This, of course, is partlv due to the
lack of encouragement given to jumping horses by
racing cluhs, and is wholly deplorable. The type of
horse required for hurdleracing and steeplechasing
where the competition is keen would be worth a
hundred times more to Australia than the weedy
quadrupeds which flourish on the flat. A good
’chaser has to have courage, stamina, speed and intel-
ligence. He is an animal only occasionally seen in
Australia, being crowded out by a multitude of
squibs which can leap over six furlongs. Breeding
for topnotch performers on the flat yields about o
per cent, of good stuff and 95 per cent, of rubbish.
Among the horsemen Foulsham did best
at the recent Randwick meeting, having three wins
in three days. Then he got rubbed out for a couple
of months for crossing in too quickly over the field
in the Cumberland Stakes with Ulva's Isle. Two of
the wins were easy. In the other foulsham rode a
really good race. That was when he moved Eurobin
along in the Doncaster. Other winning jocks had
no more than a single success apiece. Some of the
riding seen at the meeting was good ; some of it was
downright bad. At least three races were lost by
want of brains in the pilot. In several others the
tactics followed were rotten, but whether this was
due to the boss or the boy cannot be decided. In
the Cup Lewis rode an excellent race on Green Cap
and had horribly bad luck to run against a snag like
Prince Bardolph. But there was another race in
which Lewis didn’t ride an excellent race, though, as
it happened, his prad could not have won, anyhow.
Seems as if Australia is getting shorter of first-class
riders than ever. Yet it is a business in which it is
well worth while training kids properly. A lot
depends on it; the earnings are good, as a rule, and
are sometimes very good. But when an owner sees
the individual astride his horse in a mile and a half
race frantically trying to win from four furlongs, his
impulse is rather to wring someone’s neck than to
give three cheers. Quite a lot of these lads seem to
be “short” under their hats.
The totalisator has been showing what it
can do in the way of dividends on a second horse.
In South Aus., with 10 or more starters one-fourth
of the money in the machine goes to backers of the
beast that just didn’t win. Naturally it is generally
in the nature of a consolation rather than a prize.
But at Victoria Park recently they collected about
£l7 each; and at Oakbank on Easter Mondav the
17 plucky investors who went for Miss Robbie had
the surprising return of £35 165., while the 1157
who went for the favorite —which won —had to be
content with 31s. (which means laying nearly 6 to
4 on). £35 16s. for second, in a field of 13, is the
kind of thing that a bookmaker does not pay.

Trainer James Redfearn, who died
recently,, left a bit behind him. After winning the
Melbourne Cup with Malvolio he bought a substantial
house, with a few acres of land. There, over at die
back of Caulfield racecourse, he inhabited his little
estate in a quiet, early-to-bed, early-rising manner,
taking in a few nags as boarders, and making a
crust thereby, while the unearned increment on his
acres piled gently up. Now the widow Redfearn
finds herself with over £12,000 in hand—wealth,
compared with what most trainers’ widows find in
tile stocking when the old man goes out of the game
for good.
* * * *
Portrush, winner of the Epsom Handicap
three years ago, was led into the sale ring at Syd-
ney last week with one of his fore fetlocks as big as
a pumpkin, and was sold for £42. Then a couple
of hatracks were brought along, and the auctioneer
asked for bids. The animals were Posinatus and Sir
Alwynton, both geldings and great turf performers.
They had been out in a paddock. For the first his
old trainer, .Tames Chambers, parted with £5O, and
Sir Alwvnton's price was £B5. A tragedy in three
acts. No wonder an old hand, looking on, remarked:
“Half a horse’s breeding is what goes down his
neck.”
“Trot” ; Racing men parted with some
good-sized wads at the yearling sales at Sydney last
week. Meanwhile the high-priced animal continues
not to win with great regularity. Prince Bardolph,
first in the Sydney Cup, was a moderate-priced nag.
So, too, was Portrina, runner-up in the Champagne
and winner of the Easter Stakes. Wolaroi, who has
amassed more cash than any other two-year-old raced
in Australia, could have been bought last year for
a very reasonable sum. There used to be” a time
when people who dredged up a large quantity of
cash for a yearling were regarded as “great judges,”
and all the rest of it. Apparently the best that can
he said about most of them now is that they have
big hearts. Buying an infantile moke is a gamble,
and either 90 per cent, of all the stuff that is heard
about breeding and conformation, etc., is mere guff
or the majority of youngsters are ruined in the
training stables. Perhaps the painful results arise
from a combination of the two. Breeding in its
relation to proved speed in the pedigree seems to be
the test of price, and on a broad view" of the thing
looks about as unreliable as it well could be.
There are other factors somewhere in the production
of the galloping machine, and no one seems to have
got near them. How is Woorak or EuroVn or Wola-
roi or Desert Gold to be accounted for ? How
explain Bobrikcff? The man who can do that can
invest his cash to good purpose. The man who
cannot is taking a long shot in the dark—and, great
Solomon’s purse, how often he misses!
* * * *
Another cheap nag. Gunrest, is in the lime-
light in Maori land. This prad, a five-vear-old
Calibre gelding, was put up to auction by a dis-
gusted owner in December and pushed towards some-
one who said he had 75 guineas. Since then the pur-
chase has won four good races in succession, including
the Southland Cup. When last heard from the
original owner was waking up o’ nights to call
himself rude names.

“Moana”: M.L. jockey F. E. Jones’s
record in piloting winners in the Dunedin Cham-
pagne Stakes (B. 9/3/’l6) is good, but what about
Geo. Clifford s record as an owner ? When Good
Hope arrived first the other dav the great M L sport
had his tenth win, starting in 1889 with Cvnisca.
F. E. Jones, by the way, has now been on top of
the winner three years in succession.

Under the new Tasmanian Anti-Gaming
Act it is an expensive business to bet in the Speck
except through the tote or Tatt.’s, and to get
caught. The minimum penalty for either bookmaker
or client is £2O, which pulls up with a jerk those
J s.P. or P.M. s who would, if left to themselves,
hand out a fine of 10s. Already the State revenue
has raked in over £ 200 in fines,' and there are more
cases to follow. •
“F.C.”: “Harrison O.” (R. 20/4/T6), in
his remarks on the Peacock Government’s proposal
to further curtail racing, has overlooked something
If anybody imagines that the total abolition of
racing—or any other sport—will encourage recruit-
ing to any extent, he should get him to a mental
specialist at once; his case is serious. The sole
reason why horseracing, and especially pony-racing,
should be curtailed, not temporarily, put perma-
nently, is that we can’t afford it. The army of
jockeys, trainers, gatekeepers, ticket-sellers, spielers,
Noses and what not, about which “H. 0.” is solici-
tous, is a non-productive parasite. Let it have its
week-end relaxation, certainly; but the rest of the
time it should be persuaded to do some useful toil.
The public would be many thousands of pounds per
annum better off; and before we’re through with
the war, and particularly the effects of the war,
we’ll feel the need of being better off.

“T. Mac” : Enter this for the Hard Luck
Stakes. It was on a Victorian racecourse. A hot,
tired and dusty punter had splashed all he had on
a rank outsider in the last race. Besides the receipt
he held from Shamus O’Cohen, all he possessed was
an empty whisky flask and a sandwich. When the
race commenced the favorite gave assembled Jeru-
salem the cold shivers by clearing out from his field,
and it looked a palace to a pebble on him. The
plunger’s fancy, however, came from nowhere, and
got up in time to snatch the bacon by an eyebrow.
The punter was naturally elated at the moke’s suc-
cess, and went to O’Cohen for. a settlement. lie
of the Nose told the punter that he (The Nose)
wasn’t hungry, and the intending collector didn’t drop
to the Bag’s meaning till he glanced up and saw
that he was presenting the sandwich for payment.
In his excitement at the close finish he had chewed
the ticket instead of the bread and meat.
Sydney “Thousand” —the biggest trotting
event in the Ma State —was decided last week.
There were nags competing from Victoria and
Queensland ; but the whole thing was spoiled by the
foolishness of allowing 26 animals to start. The
result was a mix-up of wheels and horses which put
seven prads out of action. Golden Robin made every
blade of grass a winner, and acquired the cash with
two lengths, to spare in 3min. 27isec.

“Mynn”: It was not right to say that the
first occasion Horan took the ball was when he
brought the late Billy Murdoch’s famous innings to
a close. Eight years previously, in his first inter-
colonial. he captured Charlie Bannerman’s wicket
when the mighty smiter
had amassed 81 runs. A
couple of years later, at
Sydney, he bowled like
this: 8 overs, 7 maidens,
3 wickets, 1 run. He
bowled occasionally in
England in ’7B, and
about this time he and
Harry Boyle were usually
the opening bowlers for
the East Melbourne
Club. The Sydney match
referred to, by the way,
must have been enough
to turn all the spectators
into Rip Van Winkles.
In N. S. Wales’s second
innings 163 overs (four
balls to the over) were
sent down, from 107 of
which the batsmen re-
fused to score. There
were more maidens de-
livered than there were
runs scored—lo 7 to 102.
Of 83 overs by Sam Coss-
tick 66 were maidens,
and 25 runs were scored
off him—a bout 21
maidens for each run.

Temora (N.S.W.) pony stewards jumped
on several people with both feet last week, four per-
sons being notified that their assistance in maintain-
ing the breed of horses at a high level would not be
required for at least two years. It all happened
over a pony called Lazy Bill. About a month back
the casual Bill was engaged in a race at Temora.
The public thought so much of Weary’s chance that
he was an odds-on favorite until a few minutes
before the start of the dash. Then the betting turned
upside down and another nag occupied front posi-
tion. The stewards recalled Bill, who had sauntered
round to the starting post; but while a change of
riders was being suggested the race was started
minus the one-time favorite. As the judge didn’t
happen to be in the box the event was ordered to
be re-run to give him a chance of finding a winner.
Meanwhile amid the general confusion Lazy Bill was
galvanised into action to such an extent that not
a hair of his’ tail could be discovered within the
precincts of the course. It was for that speedy work
that the owner, jockey, trainer and another man
received the sack. Bill goes into retirement with
them.
Roughhouse” Charlie* Rums wears a
descriptive tag that suits him well, though it doesn’t
mean just what it was understood to mean. “Rough-
house” suggested a cove of capacity—a sort of ring
tiger who would make things warm for the best.
Inspection of the gentleman reveals that the title
must have been given as crystallisation of the
methods of a bar-room scrapper. Burns was put up
at Sydney Stadium on Saturday against Llew
Edwards, the English featherweight, now accumulat-
ing enough meat to get into the lightweight class,
and he lost all the way. Burns was reported to be
lightweight champion of Canada. If this is so, the
Canadian crop of lemons must be heavy. Charles
knows nothing about boxing. His plan of defence is
to take all that is coming ; of attack, to bore in with
head down, fight for the abdomen from below and
uppercut from underneath. On Saturday he got
beans. Edwards pasted him with left and right,
long and short, straight and crooked —and every
three minutes the Canuck wandered back to his
corner, had the gore wiped out of his eyes and
mouth, and returned to be bashed some more. He
was just a chopping-block, of great courage, vitality
and awkwardness ; and the short and simple history
of the unpleasantness is that Edwards, after punch-
ing good and hard for 20 rounds, ran out an easv
winner. The only way of ending things sooner
would have been for Edwards to slin a c,>u.

Easter Monday’s 200-mile motor-bike
scurry on the Mortlake-Terang (Vic.) road saw win-
ner A. R. Watts, on a 3A-h.p. Rudge-Multi, put up
a world’s record for cycles under 600 c.c—loo miles
in 120 min. He covered the 200 miles in 4hr. 4min.
27sec. Fastest time was made by N. H. Duckett in
3hr. 40min. 42sec. on a 7-h.p. Indian—lBsee. better
than Erwin G. Baker’s best sprint over the distance.
The swiftest motorist of the 45 who started was
H. A. Parsons, on a Harley-Davidson jigger. He
toppled the world’s record for 100 miles down from
the 108 min. of Ken Walker, made two years ago, to
9 1 min. 20sec. Parsons had covered four laps (135
miles) in 129 min. 4sec. when a valve cracked and

Clarke Maconachy, who came from .Maori-
land to play Fred Lindrum at billiards, is just now
feeling sorry for himself at Alcock’s Parlor, Mel-
bourne. He started a long game last week with
2000 points to his credit, and had lost his lead ere
Lindrum hail scored 6000. The champion played a
steady, versatile game from the start, whereas Mac—
a slim young lightweight with an Irvingesque face —
seemed to lose all his confidence when he found what
he was up against. His capacity for big scoring is
limited to the losing-hazard stroke at present, and
the young- man is no great shakes at that. He works
too rapidly, as though he were used to something
easier than a regulation match-table; and though
he is a fine freegoer when lie’s on the job, he scarcely
retains his accuracy for 30 or 40 successive
hazards. He plays with a longer and looser cue than
Lindrum. If genius is an infinite capacity for taking
pains, Mac. will never be a genius. He makes
machine-like strokes in a careless way, which is an
unreasonable proceeding. A machine is never care-
less.

Arthur Griflith got a mention outside the
Petrol Commission the other day. Ilis one
young hopeful had presented Carmichael's
“Riflemen’s Battalion” with a bulldog. It
brings to memory two boys of another bat-
talion. One had the muscles of a leg torn ;
the second had a hand out of action. “And
ho tv did you get hurt?” asked the kind old
lady visitor. “Oh, I ain’t been to the war,”
said the Jimbiil with the torn leg. It was
Teddy that did it. He’s a bulldog and our
mascot —y’ know, missus, the thing what
brings you good luck.”
Fred C. Burry has put music to some
marching verses by W. M. Fleming, and
Paling’s have published the lot as a song,
with the title “Left, Left. Left.” If you
have a voice that doesn’t annoy people this
is a very suitable ditty for the time of year.
Fleming is a member of the House of Reps.,
and if his verse is rotten it’s The Bi’T.i.k-
tin’s fault for printing little tilings that he
wrote, and thus encouraging him.
It was at a recent exhibition of oil paint-
ings. A stout lady had captured the artist
and worn him threadbare with guileless in-
quiries and shallow enthusiasm. “Whose
portrait is this. Mr ? Now you really
must tell me whose portrait that is.” The
artist wearily: “Madam, that is a portrait
of nobody.” The lady, suddenly cold : “Dear
me, it’s an excellent likeness !”
“8.. J.” : The Ilawthorn-to-Prinee’s-Bridge
tram service, opened the other day, gives
Melbourne its first electric line to the city.
The route is along the historic Yarra Bank,
which was known as Richmond Paddock
until, in the early Pi's, Dr. Evans, then
Commissioner for lands, declared that a
strip from Prince’s Bridge to Punt-road was
a public thoroughfare. The City Council,
which had a toll-bar at St. Ivilda-road. reck-
oned that if Evans-road was made the muni-
cipal coffers would lose much of the traffic
from Toorak. P’ran and other suburbs, so
erected a fence across the road inside their
boundary. As soon as the last post had
been driven in, one Mitchell, owner of the
Cremorne Brewery, arrived with some em-
ployees and chopped the fence down. The
city fathers next had a deep trench dug on
the site of the demolished fence, but the
enterprising beermaker and his minions filled
it up in the stilly night. Finally, in 1875,
A. K. Smith became mayor, and a while later
the City Council made a grant towards build-
ing the road.
,T. ,T. Cusack, of Albury, one of the Ma
State’s ten-pound-a-week M.L.A.’s, threw
this at the Speaker the other day:—
(1) That, in the opinion of this House, the time
is fast approaching when the flag of victory will fly
from the ramparts of the nation.
(2) That the Government should take steps to add
(o the beauties of our harbor a statue or monument
to serve as. a palladium perpetuating the triumph of
our liberties.
(3) That such structure should have inscribed
thereon the name or symbol of the nations-constitut-
ing our allies, also the names of the brave manhood
of Australia that fell in the cause of freedom.
In the name of flic symbolic dingo. The
Bulletin moves as an amendment that >l.

“Kola”: One of the industries to which
the Protectionist party can turn its atten-
tion immediately is* tlie fairly-simple one
of making cups and saucers. At present
they all come from abroad. A lot —the best
—come from England. Vast unnumbered
dozens came from Sharmeny. Now the tide
lias set in from Japan. Can’t we do a little
thing like that? In Bendigo there lias long
been a pottery works. The firm turns out
a splendid teapot and similar ware. The
clay appears to be of the first quality. V\ by
then are we not making-the cups and plates?
The demand is almost fabulous. \ ery little
enamelware is used in this country, and
everyone breaks cups and saucers as if the
best fracturer got a bonus.
“Globe” : The latest list of wireless shore
stations gives the U.S.A. premier position
with 140. Second place is held by Great
Britain with 61, and Canada runs third
with 47. Australia completes coastal
wireless chain with 37 stations. The most
important application of wireless telegraphy
is in the establishment of communication
between ships. Here Great Britain leads
the way with 1568. the 1 .S.A. running a
poor second with 067. Germany, according
to the list, is third, with 55)7. The figures
are prepared by the Berne International
Telegraph Bureau.
“Quidsm”: Years ago. when two Jap
training ships visited Australia, one of the
most noticeable items in connection with
the visit was the zeal with which the cadets
inquired about Australian flora, and speci-
mens of any plant exhibiting phenomenal
characteristics were collected and taken on
board. The little chaps explained that the
plants would be developed in the Mikado’s
gardens and experimented with by scien-
tists to discover anything of commercial
value. In 1852 Sir Clement Markham, who
died recently, noticed the attention given to
the quinine tree in Peru. He started a
crusade for the introduction of this plant
t > India, and was scoffed at by most people.
Stubbornly he stuck to his opinion, and in
1860 went back to Peru and obtained plants.
Quinine then cost 10s. an ounce in London
and £1 an ounce in India. The subsequent
cultivation of the tree in India brought down
the price to 3s. in London and 3d. in India.
Personally Markham derived no profit, but
the world did. Is there nothing for us in these
two incidents? Who knows what wonderful
properties lie undeveloped in the luxuriant
growth of Northern Australia? And why
shouldn’t the hickory, for instance, thrive in
Australia as well as Australian wattle and
eucalypti do in Africa and Spain? It has
often been found that plants from one coun-
try grow better in another, a fact supposed
to be due to the large supply of suitable
food left in the soil by the indigenous plants
and available for the newcomer.

THERE is something most satisfactory about
having on the right shoes for the , occa-
sion in hand. One feels comfortable,
smart, confident. And for any and every
occasion nothing could be more suitable or more
charming than patent leather, which always
looks well and goes so beautifully with every
colour and every fabric. Indeed, this little
shoe here illustrated will add no small share
of smartness and tone to one’s spring suit or
simmer gown. And it is only one style of
many equally desirable, equally charming. For
Bostock shoes, besides being the last word in
smartness, all have a certain individuality which
sets them apart amongst ready-made . shoes,
gives them the personal quality and the dis-
tinctive tone of shoes made specially to measure.

P.E.C.: Ought to be some good stuff there.
Fire away... .Riverina: Oh no, the bulk-handling
problem is not .so simple as all that. Tait, the Vic-
torian Commissioner who was imported from Canada,
and had handled more wheat in bulk than any three
other men who have ever come this way, was under-
stood to think very little of the scheme for Austra-
lian use. Anyhow, how absurd it is of the Laborites
to think of making a party cry of it! It looks more
like a red herring than a democratic principle
J.C.: Don’t know that particular scheme; but the
firm is a notorious Yankee pusher of wild cats....
W.8.J.: What’s the matter with gumming a piece of
blank paper over the space and writing the address
on that ?.... Voice H.: Well, it's a cheerful change.
One sample:—
Where’er they roam, the wide world o’er,
They are sure to be' well received,
And be welcomed more, and yet more,
For the sake of their Anzac breed;
Their magnificent feats of arms:
Gaba Tepe ! Quinn’s Post! Lone Pine!
Athletes, bushmen from Austral farms,
Anzac —Ghurkas’ swift charging-line.
Don’t quite see what the Ghurkas are doing in it
unless they are to increase the uncertainty as to
what it is all about.... Moondyne: Not remarkable
work even for a lady of 15... .M. 8.8.: Avaunt....
E. 0.: “Creation” yarn may represent fine research,
but it makes dull reading. “Living Past” is crude
unpleasantness. “In the Ward” doesn’t grip....
E.H.P.: “From out the crucible of Hell” is neither
verse nor prose, but a weird jumble calculated to pro-
duce derangement of the mental liver.... E.R.: Fair
verse, but little appeal in it.... Billie K.:, You have
a long way still to g 0... .Elies Dee: No joy in them,
even if you are an admirer of “Bellerive’s” “peotry.”
J.K.S.: This fine bit ought to have recognition:—
No! These are but mists, which vanish with the sun,
With human passions rise, • by Providence undone.
You ask yourselves: Who sowed the seed in. Ger-
many ?
I answer you: Scheiman, Trietske and Bernhardi.
These three and more have hastened Germany’s down-
fall
By a bitterness of preaching, displaying a hatred of
us all,
We were to be dismembered, till not a Power re-
mained ;
This was the creed of Germany, for this by Heav’n
arraigned.
... .P.E.C.: Good idea ; rotten verse. .. . A.C.8.: Who
are you with your fine moral nose tilted at the “little
bastard” ? It was Robert the Devil’s name for the
boy who became William the Conqueror, and a lot of
kings and queens have accepted the fact with becom-
ing grace. . . .A.H.8.: That “elder of the church”
fixed it from the start. Why don’t you think round
your subject before you write about it ?.... Red Tape:
Yes, we have read worse. Also better. .. .J.D.Y.: Not
quite up. Try again. ... Sarto : “Sweet Music” should
have been a soft, sighing thing, but it bumps like an
ungreased wheelbarrow that has seen better days....
Anzac: You don’t get the atmosphere.... Driver 69:
The Censor wouldn’t let you say that. .. .Gunga: Too
rough ..C.C.D.: “A Grandson of Sinners” is not a
yarn, but a framework on which a yarn might be
built. .. .F. 8.: Not in our line. Might sell elsewhere.
. ...Uno Hoo: If you send any more of it the office
murderer will be told off under sealed orders to visit
your Labor League. . . .W.H.M.: “Plum Jam’? is a
weary ditty with a limp and croak that would dis-
courage recruiting. .. .W.C.: “Black shame” on the
lion’s whelp that can’t try to roar without suggest-
ing a tenth-rate vaudeville encore... .M.A.: The
metre beats us. Your phrases are good if you could
get them into tune. .. .A. 11.: It’s certainly a remark-
able effort: —•
But when the charge was sounded who then hung
back?
Not Billy, but the wise, careful ones —they did.
But enough were men to take Lone Pine alack!
They refused to support them worth a quid.
So they quietly surrendered to the Turkeys
And came back quietly to Australia once more;
We done our bit the Light Horse boys you BB’s—
You hung back like mongrels waiting there for more!
. . .'. J.C.McD.: Poor stuff... .J.J.T.: Your “Phan-
toms” have all the weird, unearthly appeal of boiled
cabbage. .. . J.D.: We refuse to live in the room with
it for another hour.... Stanhoe: Pars are not dealt
with in this column V.T.: As dull a hash-house
as we ever met.... Kismet: You may be the famous
author of the “Blood-stained Burglar of Cowheel
Flat” for all that we care, but you have forced us to
read a long, badly-written screed about nothing, at all.
“Footwarmer”: In my daily hunts as a
recruiting sergeant for new Anzacs I strike
some original heroes. This is what a bush
Parsifal put off on me the other day when I
asked him why he wasn’t at the Front
winning V.C.’s: —
I have heard of the bad women in Egypt, and feel
sure that if I went there the temptation would be
too. strong, and I’d only be an expense to the Govern-
ment.
The drinks are on me if you can beat it.
The busiest youth in Maoriland is one
day going to hire a decent-sized transport
to accommodate the prizes he has captured.
When rising 12, he was convicted at Inver-
kegville of breaking and entering, and sent
to a State training farm. A month Inter
he took a dislike to the place, and left on a
borrowed horse. The authorities invited him
back by the scruff of the neck. Within a
week he bolted again, was captured by offi-
cial pursuers, and transferred to a place
behind a higher fence. But this retreat
turned out a bore, and the police found him
200 miles away at Dunedin. A month
later he repeated the performance with
variations, being bagged this time at
Lyttelton, where he was charged with
several thefts. The other day he again
decided that captivity was no place for a
busy man, and left some more. He arrived
100 miles off in four days, and after
making several necessary thefts pushed on.
borrowed the first bicycle that hove in sight,
and rode 70 miles. A stoppage was then
made to snare clothes and grub. After that
he accused the jigger of being no good, and
continued the journey in an appropriated
gig. At Evansdale, Otago, over 200 miles
from the starting post, the Law overhauled
him in a motor, with an invitation to go to
a reformatory for three years. The invita-
tion has been accepted without enthusiasm,
subject of course to the usual week-end
excursions,


The True Safeguard
of Baby's Health
iSllenburgs Foods
THE milk of a healthy mother confers a de-
gree of immunity to infection to the young
infant. Many mothers, however, though
willing, cannot nurse their babies for various
reasons. In such cases the greatest care should
be taken in selecting a proper substitute. Ordi-
nary cow’s milk cannot be regarded as a safe
food for infants; it is acid, contains indigestible
curd, and is almost invariably contaminated
with harmful germs. By using the “Allenburys”
Foods, which are free from all dangerous
organisms, and effectually replace human
milk, security for baby is ensured and vigorous
growth and health are promoted. The
“Allenburys” Foods are largely used and
recommended by the Medical and Nursing
Professions; they have stood the test of time
and have become a household necessity all
over the world.

You can reduce the running expenses of
your car by using
Michelin Tyres.
Tyre bills are the heaviest item in the upkeep of a car; therefore every motorist
who wishes to economise should ask himself this question : Am I using tyres which are
the cheapest per mile run ? ”
The claims for economy were never so insistent as at present ; therefore if you are
not satisfied with your tyre mileage we would urge you to try MICHELIN TYRES.
MICHELIN TYRES are manufactured in
ONE QUALITY ONLY—THE BEST.
Michelin Tyres and Accessories can be
obtained from all the Leading Garages.
This Wife
and Mother
Wishes to tell you FREE
How She Stopped Her
Husband’s Drinking.
By all Means Write to Her
and Learn How She Did It.
For over 20 years James Anderson, of
963 Elm Ave., Hillburn, N.Y., U.S.A., was a
very hard drinker. His case seemed a hope-
m
m
less one, but 10 _ years
ago his wife, in their own
little home, gave him
a simple remedy which,
much to her delight,
stopped his drinking
entirely.
To make sure that
the remedy was respon-
sible for this happy re-
sult she also tried it on
her brother and several
of her neighbors. It
was successful in every
case. None of them has
touched a drop of in-
toxicating liquor since.
She now wishes everyone who has drunk-
enness in their homes to try this simple
remedy, for she feels sure that it will do as
much for others as it has for her. It can be
given secretly if desired, and without cost
she will gladly and willingly tell you what it
is. All you have to do is write her a letter
asking her how she cured her husband of
drinking, and she will reply by return mail
in a sealed envelope. As she has nothing to
sell do not send her money. Simply send a
letter with all confidence to Mrs. Margaret
Anderson at the address given above, taking
care to write your name and full address
plainly. (We earnestly advise every one of
our readers who wishes to cure a dear one
of drunkenness to write to this lady to-day.
Her offer is a sincere one.)*
Are You Deaf?
If so, you can be
relieved by using:
WILSON’S COMMON-SENSE EAR-DRUMS
A new scientific invention, entirely different in
construction from all other devices. Assist
the deaf when all other devices fail, and where
medical skill has given no relief. They are
soft, comfortable and invisible; have no wire

is the Solid Silver Sugar Basin that we

Our Managing Director, when in Eng-

thousands of pounds’ worth of Solid Silver
Goods, and asked for a special cut quota-
tion for hundreds of Solid Silver Sugars-
and Creams to be made in slack times,
and to be paid for spot cash against
delivery.
RESULT, we are offering the daintiest:
designs in Extra Heavy Solid Silver
Sugars and Creams, at prices less than

They are unheard-of value, yet of
exquisite finish, and the last word in
designs.

Little Lectures
by Nurse ‘Wincarnis
(Lecture No 4.)
Weakness
Every movement ofthebody
uses up a definite amount of
vitality. When you overtax
yourself, or your vitality is
undermined by illness, your
whole system becomes too
exhausted to recover its lost
vitality without assistance.
Your system is like a plant
that is drooping for want
of water. And just as
water revives a drooping
plant —so 4 Wincarnis ’ gives
new life and new vitality to
a weakened constitution.
Because 4 Wincarnis ’ pos-
sesses a four-fold power.
It is a Tonic, a Restorative,
a Blood-maker, and a Nerve
Food —all in one. Therefore
creates new strength, new
blood, new nerve force and
new vitality. The benefit
begins from the first wine- |
glassful. You can feel it
doing you good. Over 10,000 '
Doctors recommend ‘ Win-
carnis,’ especially to those
who are Weak, Anaemic,
‘Nervy’ or Run-down.
Begin to get well i
TO-DAY.
‘Wincarnis’ is made in England by
COLEMAN & CO., Ltd.; Wincarnis
Works, Norwich. You can buy
‘Wincarnis’ from all Chemists and
Stores selling wines, prices 4/- and
6/6, but if you experience any diffi-
culty in obtaining it, write direct
to Sole Distributing Agents, Fassett
& Johnson, 5-7 Barrack St., Sydney.


“Gayndah : Recently two bullocks were
found stiff in the vicinity of Gavndak with
their horns interlocked. Evidently they had
been arguing the point when their antlers
jambed and prevented the poor brutes either
eating or drinking. What a nightmare of
devils it must have been before the end
came!
Further evidence of the blessings of pie-
bald marriage. Mahomed Hassan, of Bris
bane, is now resting at the country’s ex-
pense, awaiting his trial on a charge of
shooting his white wife. It’s the usual story
of the ill-mated couple living at last on the
most distant of diplomatic relations, fol-
lowed by a visit one evening from the Pro-
phet and the emptying of the contents of
three revolver cartridges into the hapless
woman.
Queensland is no fit place for the white
race. Mrs. Boland, of Toowoomba, decided
to quit last week, at the reputed age of 104
years; and certainly she was a middle-aged
woman when she went to the Downs 62
years ago. She left, besides mere grand-
children, 62 great-grandchildren and five
great-great-grandchildren.
The Government is going into the fire
insurance business by establishing an office
to control the risks under the Workers'
Dwellings Act- The risks now amount to
£1,260,000, in 4833 policies. In 10 months
£5844 was paid to private offices, and the
claims amounted to £5B; and that looks like
something soft. It is understood that, as
soon as the office is established, ordinary
business will be undertaken.
This is the worst dengue season in
Bananaland since the big wave of 12 years
ago. In the tropics whole towns have been
swept, even the mild Darling Downs has had
its dose, and the curse has encroached upon
the Ma State further than ever before. In-
deed, what the Tweed (N.S.IV.) got was
worse than Brisbane’s sample. Little is
known concerning the imported curse, and
few doctors seem to have bothered with
reasearch work. The epidemic is treated
much in the same way as influenza—with
Oriental resignation.
The Dublin shindy emphasises what might
have happened but for the splendid loyalty
and devotion of the Irish Nationalists,

IN BANANA LAND
Quaint butcher’s ad. from a Courier of
1866 :—
Rally round the Original Poor Man’s Friend in
Ann Street, Valley, and get prime beef at Id. a lb.
Remember the cattle we sell have not died of
pleuro-pneumonia like the other cheap butcher.
Rider Haggard ought, anyhow, to
say nice things about Bananaland when he
returns to the Big Fog. The State Govern-
ment listened to his scheme for settling ex-
service men on the land and slipped
1,000,000 acres into his pocket.
Jacky, the South Sea Islander who was
burned to death in his hut near Beaudesert
a couple of weeks ago, was probably the last
survivor of a dead industry. He had worked
for Captain Towns 50 years ago, when the
enterprising skipper proved that Bananaland
could grow cotton equal to the world’s best.
The 100 bales raised at Townsvale —Bobby’s
plantation on the Logan —fetched Is. Bd. per
lb., or nearly £25 a ton.
Out of 116 legislators in the Assembly and
Council only two have volunteered —and both
are strenuous Tories. There are, however,
by way of compensation, quite a number of
brilliant Parliamentary orators zealously
directing the other - fellow to the Front.
From ex-German New Guinea: —
The native of this new Possession is just about
the most sorely perplexed person on earth at pre-
sent. He knows that there has been some big
change because of a big fight somewhere, but after
that he’s boxed.
In German New Guinea and Papua the natives
know only three nations of men—Englishmen, Ger-
mans and Burns-Philp’s men. The last he recog-
nises as friendly with all tribes, but the other two
bother him considerably. He thoroughly under-
stands that the Englishman lias saved him a very
great amount of banging and booting and that he
is a much softer boss than the German : but for the
life of him he cannot make out whether the terri-
tory is still German or British. He observes that
the Germans are just as plentiful as ever, that they
trade more than ever and are flourishing, while the
British trader is more or less boycotted. Brown
brother knows also that on King George's birthday
when a health is drunk to “His Majesty” the pro-
ceedings have been so quiet that the day seems just
like any other day. But on the Kaiser’s Day he
finds that there is high holiday—all very impressive
to the adjacent native who arrives at certain beliefs
and unbeliefs and passes them on to his more savage
brethren scattered about the Territory.
Then, too, the Germans of the Territory so
openly boast of the ultimate victory of their Father-
land that in a conspicuous manner they have in-
spired the native with the belief that the old rule
will come back soon ; not that the native wants that
—he does not—but he does want to be on the right
side of the fence when the settlement takes plaqe,
and he well knows that it won’t be good for him
if he is on the wrong side should the ITun come out
on top. The native was impressed with Germans’
power through being allowed to witness the flogging
of the Rev. Cox; they were quite wrongly not per-
mitted to see the subsequent flogging of the respon-
sible Huns. It is, by the way, to the credit of the
natives that they showed much kindness to the Rev.
Cox and rescued him from a second flogging.
To-day the Germans are so arrogant that it is
about time their wings were clipped again. Like
thq nigger, the Squarehead takes every advantage of
kindness, while he regards it as one of the most
potent signs of weakness. An eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth and half a dozen Germans for one
Britisher is the sort of policy that he respects. No
act in the British administration to date did so
much to bring the Hun to his senses as the flogging
of the cruel bullies who whipped Cox. From the
moment these wretches pulled up their slacks after
the operation they and their countrymen who looked
on were sorer, sadder, wiser and more careful inhuman
beings.
“Chink”: Twenty-eight years ago the
little schooner Ariel sailed from Bundaberg
in quest of Islanders for half a local
plantations. The skipper was one Warne,
the mate Rothwell (now in the Ordnance
stores at Enoggera), and the Government
agent a young chap named Armstrong. From
Bundaberg the Ariel went to the New Heb-
rides, thence to the Lord Howe group, and
finally to the Solomons. At Malaita, that
still-cannibalistic isle at the south-eastern
corner of the Solomons, which was reached
early in December, ’BB, a message came to
the ship that a boy up in a small village
desired to recruit, and that the chief thereof
thirsted for medicine for an injured leg.
Rothwell was suspicious, but Armstrong
complacently loaded up with bluestone
water and went off to execute the jobs. He
never returned, and Rothwell had to shoot
half a dozen savages before he could make
the boat again from his post on the beach.
SHELL AND KERNEL.
(Scene: Dining-room in hush shanty.)
SURPRISED TOILER (who has found fragment of wood in his soup): “I kin stand yer tin-
dog. mum, hut hang me if I eat the kennel."
That's the story; this is the sequel. While
lately on a stray visit to Malaita, a roving
seafarer struck a big nigger wearing a curi-
ously-wrought, solid gold ring that nearly
covered a joint of one finger. He secured
the ring for half a ‘dozen bottles of pain-
killer, and then discovered that it bore the
initials of the careless young agent who
constituted the bill of fare at a heathen
holiday 28 years ago! A Solomon Island
trader is now in Brisbane searching for any
relative who might want the grim relic.
“Dinkum”: Corporal Harry Mills, now in
camp at Addison-road, Sydney, with
the Queensland reinforcements of the 9th
Artillery Brigade, was the sensation-provider
of Brisbane two or three years ago. He
used to drive six-in-hand along Queen-street
and hold up the traffic while he turned cor-
ners. At the Brisbane Exhibition about two
years ago he drove six-in-hand round the
show-ring without reins, using only the
reports of a revolver to direct his team. The
son of wealthy English people, he married
a Brisbane girl, Hilmar Ohman, stands six
feet seven in his socks, and is built in
proportion.
“Galleryite” : Hughes will go nearer shat-
tering the Labor movement than any man
who has yet arisen. Here in Bananaland
the probilly and the antibilly elements
threaten to clash soon and seriously. The
Industrial Council sees nothing but danger
in the Prime Minister as a leader. Finlay-
son, M.P., leads a movement against the
little man’s rowdy Imperialism. This sec-
tion has cabled its ideas to a London paper.
The greatest danger lies in the fact that the
party is no longer homogeneous; and when
the financial aftermath comes along with its
inevitable distress it will take a lot of tact
to prevent disruption.
The Walled Garden.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Splashed by the sun, the rain and the dew.
Green and secluded a garden grew;
None save the friends of the gardener knew.
Clustering buildings towered on high,
Grey smoke-stacks sullied the arch of sky,
And roaring traffic went thundering by.
The red rose scattered her dusky blooms,
The lupin broidere'd with Spring-blue looms,
The lotus opened her golden moons.
A beautiful thing with a life apart.
Caught in the web of the city’s mart.
The casket gleamed with its jewelled heart.
Green and secluded a garden grew.
Was it planted in joy or wrought with rue?
None save the soul of the gardener knew.
QUEENSLAND.
A GOURE-JONES.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, April 29, 1916.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Except for the spectacular procession of
troops, Anzac Day in Brisbane was mostly
a solemn affair. The city couldn't quite
decide whether to take out its hanky or give
way to the promptings of the tinkle in its
spine and cheer itself hoarse. It
finally decided to make the first anniversary
an elaborate in memoriam day, and opened
the proceedings by overflowing the churches.
In the afternoon the largest crowd ever
seen in Queen-street watched the procession.
The wounded and invalided soldiers w r ere, it
was announced, to have seats on the plat-
forms near the G.IAO. The “seats,” how-
ever, were in reality the steps at the front
of the platform where the mighty were
installed. Heavy rain fell just before the
procession began, and these poor perches
got uncomfortably wet. But Billjim
lias grown used to small inconveniences
like that; though on his Day it would have,
been appropriate if his Windsor-uniformed
Ex., his scarlet gold-mounted aide, and the
rabbit-skinned Hetherington had changed
places with him just for once.
The Ninth Battalion men arrived in a
body, by themselves. It had been arranged
for the Light Horsemen to precede them in
accordance with the usual military custom;
but the Ninth reckoned that the emu fea-
thers, having had little or nothing to do
with the Landing, should drop. to the rear
for this occasion.
Races drew big crowds to Eagle Farm
last Monday and again to-day. The fro'ck-
ing lingers between the end of a limp sum-
mer and the beginning of a too-fashionable
winter. Locks are drawn severely back
from the brow and pushed under a tea-cup
hat —tactics not becoming to the vast
majority.
Two weddings of interest took place this
week. One was the marriage of Dr. Arthur
Ward, only son of Mr. and Mrs. C. H. Ward,
of Warwick, to Phyllis Webb, fourth daugh-
ter of Dr. and Mrs. Webb, of South Brisbane.
Lulu Webb and Mabel Ward were the brides-
maids. Dr. and Mrs. Ward are motoring
round the Northern Rivers district before
settling down to the problem of keeping house
on B.M.A. wages.
On Thursday night Marion, elder daughter
of the late politician D. H. Dalrymple. was
married to G. S. Colman. Bishop Le Fanu
tied the bow, and Miss Margaret Dalrymple
was the bridesmaid. The bride has just put

How to Treat Your Hair and Complexion
A Few Simple Beauty Hints.
By Mdlle. GABY DESLYS, the well=known Parisian
Actress.
YOU ask me for a few hints on the
treatment of the hair and complexion.
Well, the less “treatment” you give
the skin the better. I do not
believe much in massage, but a
little cream to the face is neces-
sary to counteract the effects of
wind or sun. What cream
would I recommend? Well, I
advise you to use a little mer-
colised wax every night and
again in the morning, after
washing the face. Rub it
gently into the skin, then wipe
off any superfluous wax and
dust a little barri-agar over
the face. You will find that
this will be the only “treat-
ment” necessary and will keep
.vour face fresh and youthful-
looking for all your life. The mercolised
wax removes all the dead outer skin, so
that you have always a fair, fresh com-
plexion like a girl’s.
For the hair, the first and most important

Blackheads Fly Away.
Instantaneous Remedy for Blackheads, Greasy Skin and Enlarged Pores
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now coming into
general use in the boudoir. It is very
simple, harmless and pleasant. Drop a
stymol tablet, obtained at the chemist’s, in
a tumblerful of hot water. After the effer-
vescence has subsided bathe the face in the
liquid, using a small sponge or soft cloth.
In a few minutes dry the face and the often
sive blackheads will come right off on the
towel. Also the large oily pores immedi-
ately close up and efface themselves natu
r i l ! ly -. . T £ e disappears and the
skin is left smooth, soft and cool This
simple treatment is then repeated a few
times at intervals of four or five days to
ensure the permanence of the result. ‘ ’
Qrey Hair—Home Remedy.
An old=fashioned Recipe restores Youthful Appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey
hair is not desirable, and plenty of reasons
why hair dyes should not be used. But, on
the other hand, there is no reason why you
should have grey hair if you do not want
it. To turn the hair back to a natural color
is really a very simple matter. One has
only to get from the chemist two ounces of
concentrate of tammalite and mix it with
three ounces of bay rum. Apply to the
hair with a small sponge for a few nights
and the greyness will gradually disappear.
This liquid is not sticky or greasy and does
not injure the hair in any way. It has been
used for generations with most satisfactory
results by those who have known the
formula.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
The most Effective Formula ever Discovered.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but flow
to kill the hair roots permanently. For
this purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair but also to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Good News for Fat People.
Something New in Obesity Cures.
A London chemist says: “The latest
method of reducing obesity certainly is far
more pleasant and convenient than all pre-
vious methods. It consists merely in eating
clynol berries. The fat person who wants
to reduce without the usual rigid diet, exer-
cise, sweating baths, etc., now puts a few
of these little brown berries in his or her
pocket and eats three or four each day.”
Clynol berries not only eliminate fat from
the body, but also correct the tendency,
which is usually constitutional, to create
fatty matter. No discomfort whatever is
caused by their action; in fact, except for
the loss of superfluous fat and the feeling
of “fitness” so created, you would not be
aware that these little berries were doing
their work.
Local inquiry show's that clynol berries are
not very well knowm in this country, but
the demand is increasing daily, and any
chemist can quickly procure them if specially
requested to do so.

THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This Referendum round the clock
Concerning when the pubs should lock
The bar-room door
And sell no more
Of that which helps us do our block
Is making me grow grim and sour.
My troubles if the closing hour
Be six or nine—
This trouble's mine.
The ballot-paper doesn’t give
Democracy’s prerogative
To voice its need ;
Instead, indeed,
Provision’s only made for Bung
And cranks who would be better hung.
I move that this
Is most remiss,
That Parliament should prompt amend
The issues so that they extend
Another vote
As antidote.
To all the bitterness and jaw,
And endless waste of cash at law,
And curse and yell—
In brief, old Hell.
This line will stop the whole hubbub:
“Do you approve one man one pub ?”
Vote “Yes” or “No,”
And let her go!
N.S.W.
THE SNAKE.
Martin Quirk, who was one of the first
men to take up land in the Dandenong
Ranges (Vic.), is dead. P. C. Quirk, Vic-
torian Parliamentary librarian, who died
a few months ago, was a son. They both
did their bit for Australia.
Private William Ryan, born at Hay
(N.S.W.) in February, 1900, enlisted at
Ballarat early last year. He spent his
fifteenth birthday in camp at Broadmeadows
(Vic.), and his sixteenth in an English hos-
pital getting over the results of an argu-
ment with a scrap of shrapnel at Lonesome
Pine. Discharged as fit again, he rejoined
his unit, and is now once more at the vague
Front. A soldier and a man —-at 16.
Warren Anderson, a young Australian
who joined Duntroon College at 17 years
of age, had a 21st birthday recently, and
amongst the presents was promotion to be
Major in the A.I.F; and that ought to be
somewhere in the neighborhood of a record.
Young Anderson left with the first expedi-
tionary force and put in seven tough months
in Gallipoli.
“Harrison O.”: Nearly three years ago
Kink O’Malley lurched on to the Inky Way
with “Schedule 14,” a bulky volume issued by
the Home Affairs Department and containing
photos of Australian cities, Melbourne pi’ess-
men, British politicians and sundries. For
some time O’Malley thrived on the memment
provoked by that costly freak, but now, as
editor of the bi-monthly digest of the Home
Affairs Department, he has broken out again.
Apparently he has ambitions for the Com-
monwealth to compete with Titbits and the
World’s News. The 24th number of the
digress has some absorbing pages headed
“From Everywhere” and “Little Bits of
Science.” “From Everywhere” consists of
items clipped mostly from Yankee papers.
The Apostle Paul visited Salonica, then Thes-
salonica, in a.d. 51, Napoleon was one of 13
children, the Rockefeller Foundation in 1915
spent 7,000,000 dollars, and “industrial cor-
porations are now seeking to secure souls.”
In “Little Bits of Science” a news item which
the editor probably regards as a “scoop” is:
“H2O is the chemical formula for water.”
Readers learn that “the water-wheel was used
by the ancients,” but no mention is made of
the water-waggon. Also: “As the globe
rotates one-half is always exposed to sunlight
and the other half always immersed in dark-
ness.” Were the Commonwealth’s money not
spent in printing things like that in a State
paper it is doubtful whether we could win the
war. The digest also features several articles
(one running to seven pages) efrom-United
Shakes papers. The absence of a good serial,
verses by “Bellerive” and a selection of the
World’s Greatest Jokes (O’Malley’s, of
course) is, however, sure to cause unfavorable
comment.
Fluke introduces a, new religion!—
The Hauhau fancy religion of the Ringa-Tu, other-
wise, known as the Wairua Tapu of the “Holy Ghost
sect,” has been officially recognised by the Maori-
land Government. At any rate, the Government
Gazette, under the caption, “Officiating Ministers
tor 1916, announces that among the parsons whose
ove-knots are O.K. under the provisions of the
Marriage Act are 10 gentlemen of the Ringa-Tu
Church. This is a jab in the eye for the pakeha
skypilots who are fond of patronisingly describing
the Ringa-Tu as pore benighted heathen. The
Rmga-Tu has a blood-curdling history, but probably
not worse than that of pakeha churches with any
pretensions to antiquity. Ringa-Tu means “Up-
lifted Hand.” The term goes back to the Taranaki
war-prophet Te Ua, a cranky bush Messiah who
invented a ritual of incantations, which, to be effec-
tive, had to be accompanied by the sign of the
upraised hand, warding off the white man’s bullets.
After Te La’s day the rebels’ boss fighting man, Te
Kooti, the Maori De Wet, tackled the Ringa-Tu
mummeries and improved upon them with a doctor-
ing of the Psalms and Isaiah and so forth, and the
concoction made quite a respectable High Church
chant. Prisoners were butchered to the “music” •
but of that again the Ringa-Tu had no monopoly’.
A venerable friend of mine, old Eria Raukura, is a
kind of archbishop of the Upraised Hand, alias the
Holy Ghost Church; the pope of the cult is the
elusive bush prophet, Rua Canaan. Also, ex-
Native Minister Jimmy Carroll is an honorary bishop
of the Church; at any rate, the council of the
karakia, sitting some time ago in the Wairarapa
elected him as such. I can’t say that Timi Kara
takes his episcopal duties very seriously. Old Eria
tells me that there are between 4000 and 5000
members of the sect. I certainly know that it is
widely distributed; anywhere from the Wairarapa
to the Boiling-Water country you may hear the musi-
cal karakia of the Upraised Hand ascending, if you
know where and when to listen in the kainga. 'By
the way, among the 10 gazetted apostles of the
lunga-Tu there is a descendant of the man who swal-
lowed Parson Volkner’s eyes, and another bearing
the name of a renegade colored deacon who special-
ised in beheading the enemies of the faith I don’t
know, however, that the rev. brothers are any the
shadier for that. I daresay that worse things could
be catalogued against the family-trees of some of our
pakeha bishops. And, at any rate, it is only a fair
thing that the gentlemen of the Ringa-Tu should
have a cut at the marriage-fee.

A BILIOUS TONGUE
When your tongue is coated evenly, all
over, with a whitish-yellow color and your
breath is bad the chances are that you are
bilious. If you also have indigestion, con-
stipation, headache and a general ill feeling,
there is scarcely a doubt about it. Your
liver needs attention.
Harsh cathartics which purge violently
and then produce a reaction only aggravate
the trouble? Gentle assistance is what
nature needs to establish regular habits of
health, and Pinkettes, the little pink laxa-
tive pills, free from harmful or habit-form-
ing *drug3, meet the requirements most
admirably.

For Rising Young Men
The man who’s
in line for a rise
gets the start of
the staff—has the
upper hand of his
morning’s work
before the strag-
glers crowd in.
To beat the time
clock —to get in ahead
of the bunch, on the
pay roll as well as on
the job, gauge your
sleep time with Big
Ben.
Big Ben is a neat, re-
fined, business-like alarm
clock. He’s such a good
alarm because he’s such
a good time-keeper.
Promptly on the dot he
rings you up with a lively
alarm on a big, cheerful
toned gong.
Big Ben is seven inches tall,
well built, handsome, punctual.
He has a big, easily read dial—a
cheerful, deep toned voice—large com-
fortable winding keys—a light running
movement with watch-like escapement
—an alarm that calls steadily for five
minutes or intermittently for ten.
Big Ben undergoes a hundred inspec-
tions in the making and six rigid timing
tests before leaving the factory of the
Western Clock Co., La Salle, 111.,
U.S.A., Makers of Westclox. At all
clock dealers, price 12/6; postage ll-
extra.
Constipation
The case of Rheumatism or Gout
which Kruschen Salts cannot benefit
has yet to be discovered. Ibis
famous British remedy is also
recommended by Medical Men in
cases of Lumbago, Sciatica, Eczema,
Constipation, and Liver and Kidney
Disorders.
KRUSCHEN AT THE FRONT
Since the outbreak of the War, enormous
quantities of Kruschen Salts have been ordered
by, and delivered to the British Authorities, for
the use of the British Forces overseas and in
the Base Hospitals at Home. Kruschen Salts
are prescribed by Medical Men the world over.
THE WORD KRUSCHEN
The trade mark “ Kruschen ” is a legacy-
handed down from generation to generation of
the family of Evan Griffiths Hughes, the sole
Manufacturers of Kruschen Salts, and one of
the oldest firms of Manufacturing Chemists in
the County of Lancashire. Established 1754
160 years ago.

“Pick”: The wire-netting rabbit-traps
approved by “Quid” (B. 30/3/’IG) are not
at all likely to come into general favor among
trappers. The only methods yet thought
out for catching rabbits intended for export
are the old-fashioned snap-trap, yarding,
and digging out; and of these the first,
though cruel, is the most favored because
most successful. Grown rabbits will not
enter the wire-netting trap until absolutely
driven from the burrows by starvation, and
in that condition they are useless. At best
it. takes upwards of a week to starve out
the cottontails, and no rabbiter out for
business will sit in liis tent waiting for the
wire-netting blockade to work while snap-
trap catches can be made as often as the
hunter cares to go the rounds by night.
* * * *
“Galston”: Rabbit-traps are dearer,
owing to the war, and unless rabbits get
dearer, too, there will be tribulation for
careless hunters. When a trap costs Is. 4d.
or Is. 5d., in a district where rabbits bring
4d. a pair, it takes four pairs to make good
one loss. There are many ways of losing a
trap, and the most frequent among new hands
is to just forget where you put it. It is easy
enough to wander along in the daytime
setting the sprigs in the. likeliest-looking
places, but it is another thing to find them
again with a lantern. No one who has not
tried it would believe what a different
world it is then. Old hands go from trap to
trap by instinct rather than by volition;
new ones go mostly from to ——.
There are also wombats, foxes, dogs and
sheep to be reckoned with ; likewise the cocky
who discovers traps set without his permis-
sion, and “plants’” the lot; and the small
boy who collects any traps he finds on prin-
ciple. It doesn’t' take many disasters at
Is. 4d. a time to reduce the raw trapper to
penury. An unlosable trap at about 3d. a
time is badly wanted. By the way, why are
rabbits, like trousers and blankets, always
referred to as per pair, when they have to
be caught one by one? Or vice versa, why
should not bullocks, horses and elephants be
quoted at per pair, instead of singly ? There
seems to be a discrepancy, and it should be
a good subject for a Iloyal Commission. I'm
willing to act as chairman.
Victor Grayson’s confession: —“
There is a man still extant (I think he is out of
gaol) who may some time be as great as the late
Jabez Balfour if he perseveres. One day some years ago
he got into a taxi and visited nearly all the banks in
London. He wasn’t worth a cent, but the minute the
bank officials saw his name on cheques they simply
shovelled other people’s money at him. I have
nothing to say against him, and I don’t mind ex-
plaining why. I was co-editor of a well-known
weekly in London, and we had to find accommodation
for the bailiff’s man in our already overcrowded
office. My colleague was writing a character sketch
of the “man in possession,” to keep himself warm,
when a small gentleman wearing large, round spec-
tacles entered and addressed him thus: “My name is
[say] D. S. Windle, and I am very interested in
your fine paper. Kindly accept £2OO to help you
along.” Then he produced a roll of banknotes of
the very best, and placed £2OO on the desk. When
my comrade recovered from his faint D. S. Windle
had departed, but the notes were there all right.
And they were new, because Windle had only just
got them. The real joke arrived when the police
came and asked for the return of the cash. We
referred them to the bailiff, who had called again.
* * * *
“Ham”: The 16 co-operative societies in
N S. Wales are chewing over a scheme of
wholesale buying. As yet, co-operation has
made very little progress in the Ma State.
The 16 societies have only 21,700 members ;
but on a capital of £184,366 they did
£1,070,000 worth of business last year, and
are, generally, prosperous. They might be
very much more prosperous and give their
members improved returns if they kept a
keener eye on Private Enterprise. This
writer knows from experience that one large
firm of merchants used to charge co-operative
customers higher prices than it did its
ordinary monthly customers, although
the societies paid their cash on the nail,
practically; and in deeds of this kind mer-
chants don’t usually act in a lonely manner.
The criminologist seems to be on the right
track—even unto things undreamt of in his
philosophy. Lots of right-thinking people,
for instance, have been rather sceptical about
that up-to-date asset of medical science, the
“carrier” of infection, but the experience of
the Wilcannia municipality should banish
all doubts. Gordon Young, recently sen-
tenced at Broken Ilill to two years for
embezzlement, is the third Wilcannia coun-
cil clerk to be so arraigned; and Wilcannia
is an infant among towns. It isn’t likely
that a medical bacteriologist would do much
good ; but a consulting accountant might be
able to say what is amiss with the premises.
A CARTOON IN VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the war is over all bitterness must cease.
The creation of tariffs against Germany a
cowardly cry, worthy of a backward race. The
strength of Great Britain is due to her open trade
and the freedom of the seas. —Soapboiler Lever.
A little ship is on the sea,
With twenty men or so.
(Her name is “British Industry.”)
Up stands stern William Lever, he
Is quite serene, although
The vessel’s on the downward grade,
And through her side a breach is made.
(The hole is branded “Open Trade.”)
In at the hole the water pours.
(That’s “Foreign Goods,” observe.)
Without, the eager ocean roars.
The toilers, tugging at their oars,
Have plainly lost their nerve.
One man starts up to yell his views.
(The face is owned by Billy Hughes.)
“Plug up the hole at once!” he cries.
“No, no t” says Lever Brothers ;
“IVho’d bar our ‘Open Trade' denies
The holiest gospel ’neath the skies.”
“Then stop the flow !” plead others.
“Nay, cowards all! Perdition squeeze
The traitors who would scorn our pleas,
And bar the Freedom of the Seas!”

“ The above clearly shows results from a Course of SANA-VETA.”
We make this generous offer to every thin,
scraggy, emaciated person who happens to
read this advertisement. We particularly
invite those who have been sufferers for
many years from lack of flesh to accept our
offer of a FREE TRIAL PACKAGE of
SAN A-VET A, the great English tissue-
builder. We make no absurd claims for this
remarkable preparation ; we merely ask you to
give it a fair trial in your own home, and we
venture to say that you will be astonished
and delighted with the results. To give it a
fair test, get your correct weight before com-
mencing the treatment, and at the end of
seven days weigh yourself again ; the results
will speak for themselves.
There are no drastic rules with this treat-
ment. you just eat what you like and when
you like; it is convenient and easy to take,
and is perfectly harmless. SANA-VETA is
not a cure-all but a scientific preparation,
which acts directly on the digestive organs,
thereby enriching and assimilating all food
taken into the body, thus making good,
healthy flesh and filling out all hollow and
scraggy parts of the body where flesh is
wanted.
There is absolutely no reason why any thin
person should not be able to add as many
pounds to their weight as their height de-
mands (but please note that SANA-VETA
does not make superfluous fat). The
proprietors of this unique preparation are so
confident of its flesh-forming possibilities
that they are prepared to give away ten
thousand free trial packages and stand by
the results. Send to-day for a full 2/6 Free
Trial Package, and see what wonderful re-
sults can be quickly obtained. Enclose four
stamps to cover cost of postage, packing, etc.,
and we will send you the package by return
of post, securely packed and free from obser-
vation.

“Don’t wait until you are told by your employer that you are too
old-looking to hold your position, hut commence at once and use
Mrs. Mary K. Chapman’s Genuine Specific. It will darken your
hair naturally and gradually, and you will look years younger.”
FREE TRIAL BOTTLE
T N business and professional life, wlien
1 energy and clear-headedness are the
measures of success, the business man or
woman recognises only too well that the
appearance of the first grey hairs marks the
world s refusal to recognise him or her any
longer as young enough.
Looked Too Old at Forty-six
Numerous instances have come under my
notice of men and women who had held
responsible positions for years, and who at
the age of 46 or thereabouts, because their
hair had turned grey, probably through men-
tal strain, were pushed out of their position
even though they were comparatively young
and vigorous. Grey or white hair is not a
definite sign of old age. but unfortunately it
is considered to be proof of advanced age bv
the general public. There are hundreds of
men and women in all parts of Australia who
are considerably over 60 and whose hair was
as white as snow, but who now look 20 years
younger because they used my Genuine
Specific.
No Dyes or Stains.
My Genuine Specific is not a dye or stain
and you need not be afraid of discoloring your
scalp your towei, pillow cases, linen, hands,
etc. It contains no stain, paint or dye. This
can be proved by pouring a little on a sheet
of white paper. It is almost as clear as water
and absolutely harmless to the hair. Once the
hair has been restored to the original color, it
can be kept so with but very slight attention.
Gradual Satisfactory
Darkening.
The process is a natural, gradual one. T
is no suddenness, and the darkening is
patchy, as is the case when applying oral
dyes.
None Too Aged.
None are too old and no case fails to
to this treatment. Of course the <1 . n _
required varies in individual cases,
stance, a person who is only just d » -
to turn grey would not need to use a
as the person whose hair is vvnite. * c)ie( j,

The Forest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DENNY struck the murder-blow! No
one saw him pass
Lightly o’er the hedgerow, swiftly o’er
the grass;
And the forest standing nigh, mystical and
dim,
Saw the look within his eye, and it gathered
him;
Showed to him its shadowed aisles, opened
up the way,
And he took his toll of miles, stumbling
through the day ;
Many a joyous forest breeze rustled over-
head
Like the rustle of his knees brushing as he
fled.
No man crossed the murder-place, no one
ventured nigh,
No one found the pallid face staring at the
sky;
Never wench did see the deed, no one knew
the man,
Never forest thing did heed Denny as he
ran.
E'en the squirrel’s beady eyes peering round
the bole
Could not see the terror rise stark in Denny’s
soul;
E’en the bees upon the bud had not eyes
enough
For the little speck of blood red on Denny’s
cuff.
Only Denny held the dread —only Denny
knew f
Where the visage of the dead gazed into the
blue;
Only Denny knew the Fear clWElmig at hi£
mind, ;
Very swift and very near hurrying behind.
In the breeze's soughing strain Denny heard
a hound,
For the terror in his brain twisted every
sound;
And he heard an anger note in the clarion-
call
Hinging from the granite throat of the
waterfall.
Never snapt a rotted limb, never twig could
part,
But. it seemed a step to him echoing in the
heart;
Never flamed a flowering vine crimsoning
the brake
But a naked wound would shine bright for
Denny’s sake.
Soon the woodland felt a hate stir in glade
and glen.
And from out its further gate drove him
forth again;
Then the forest in its hand took of vine and
weed,
Crept across the grassy land, covered up the
deed!
And the driven man went forth maddened by
the dread,
Fleeing south or turning north, haunted by
the dead;
Deep in Denny’s stricken mind how the pale
Fear grieves,
And the forest-rain and wind sob amid.the
leaves!
MAOKILAND.
BOYCE BOWDEN.
Some Cadgers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SYDNEY is tlie natural home of the
cadger or boy of the remittance breed.
' ~ It provides an ideal climate for sleep-
ing out. Its counter-lunches have a cosmo-
politan reputation. And its beer is cheap. I
knew for years an elderly regenerate who sub-
sisted entirely on contributed beer-money and
counter victuals. More, he grew fat and
truculent on this diet. II is method was to
bail people up at the steps of a hotel or
club or other place which was fairly public
and remote from a policeman. He then
demanded assistance, and managed while
doing so to drop a hint that unless cash was
forthcoming there would be trouble. I never
tested his hardihood, partly because I did
not doubt it, partly because the humblest
coin was sufficient to buy him off. He con-
voyed a haunting impression that if he was
rebuffed he would weep, or lie down and
scream, or do something else equally degrad-
ing to all concerned. He belonged to a well-
known local family, and had near relatives
in high positions. He was the chief curse
of their lives. He would accost them any-
where, and the depth of their humiliation
was the measure of his demands. While a
loud claim for recognition at the gates of
Government House, or at the doors of a
cathedral, might be worth half-a-sovereign, a
chance meeting in a back street would not
pan out at more, perhaps, than threepence.
One way and another the old ruffian did
well for himself, and lived an easy life, till
a year or so ago, when he passed out full of
beer and dinner and dishonor.
Most people who work in offices know a
fat. clean-shaven youth with a North Coun-
try burr and an exceptional turn of impu-
dence. He enters and says: “Lendus a
pencil!” You hand one over dazedly if you
have not met him before. “Givus a bit o’
paper!” he commands. The paper is sup-
plied and he scrawls on it a misrepresenta-
tion of a human face. You then learn that
he wants 7s. 6d. to buy drawing materials,
with a view to taking up Art. What he
expects, or is invariably satisfied- with, is
(kl. for a drink. It must be two or three
years since he visited me first. I saw him
the other day. He was fatter than ever.
" . watched he drew a pencil and a small
writing block from his pocket, and operated
rapidly on it for the benefit of a foolish-
looking person who stood near. So appar-
ently he continues to do well at the old
game.
A painful affliction to those who have
been educated outside Australia is the Old
School-fellow. The Old School-fellow usually
begins by staying at a first-class hotel. His
clothes and appearance generally inspire
financial confidence. He mentions that he
is keen on bridge. He is put up at a club.
He is interested in pigeon-shooting. lie
wants to bet in a small way at the races,
but naturally doesn’t know any bookmakers.
He is presented to one or two. And then
the anguish is liable to begin. At the club,
where ready-money payments are the rule,
he collects his winnings and owes for most
of his losses —that is, if he is the typical Old
School-fellow. He goes to the Gun Club,
lays heavily on the gun—when the gun, often
enough, has been already squared to miss—
and comes away owing hundreds. At the
races he bets with the care-free elan of the
man who has no intention of settling if things
go wrong. He fades away ultimately, with
most of his hotel bill and 98 per cent, of
his gambling debts unpaid, to make no men-
tion of the loans he has contracted.
A sensational specimen of the adventurous
lad from overseas was Charles Mudbinde.
He burst in on me one day with a warm
handclasp and a hearty reminder of the dear
old days when we played House cricket
together. Gradually I reconstructed him.
His moustache and sodden cheeks and some-
what shifty eyes gave way to the counten-
ance of an older, bigger boy who had kicked
me a good deal in the happy past. He told
of his experiences in the Boer war, where he
had served as a trooper; of his efforts to
grow tea in Ceylon, and rubber somewhere
else; of the disastrous horse-breeding ven-
ture in which he engaged in Mumfordshire,
Kentucky (U.S.) ; of the misfortunes which
befel him in the Loyalty Islands in ’O4;
and of his subsequent reverses with a tour-
mg company of vaudeville performers in
-Scbtland. Then it appeared he had made
money. Would I lunch with him? I did,
though with misgivings. A few days later,
as a matter of civility, I asked him to lunch
with me. Then I tried to put him out of
my mind, like a bad debt or an unpleasant
dream. I was immersed in my daily toil
one morning when a policeman called. He
had a contused eye, and his manner was
apologetic. He handed me, dumbly, a filthy
envelope on which was inscribed the legend :
“For God's sake came at once. I am in *
terrible trouble. —C.M.” I learned that my
Old Schooltfriend was at the Water Police
Station. Have you ever visited a prisoner
at one of these resorts? It is about as cheer-
ful as lunching in a morgue.
Passing along an aisle of cells, from which
issued eerie howls and curses, I reached the
one that held Charles Mudbinde. As he
peered at me through the bars he resembled
a horrified animal. Without a doubt there
is some subtle alchemy about our police
system which operates to cow the bravest
malefactor. Mudbinde looked as if he had
been put through a mangle. It seemed he'
had got drunk and torn a bar to pieces.
The barmaid had escaped death by sheer
luck. Bottles had been broken wantonly.
Much liquor had been spilled. The fine and
damages came to £7 15s. The gibbering
terror with which he viewed the prospect
of having to “take it out” filled me with
respect for the Law’s majesty. If I had
left him there it would have haunted me
for life. Spurred on by his lachrymose
assurances that the money would be
returned upon the arrival of his next remit-
tance (monthly remittances, he now
admitted, were his sole means of support),
I handed the £7 15s. to the authorities and
he was released. I never saw or heard from
him again, though I read in a Brisbane
paper, a month or so later, that one Charles
Mudbinde had been arrested for wilfully
damaging property and attempting to do
serious bodily harm to a policeman.
The ordinary cadger works along conven-
tional lines. He has a high opinion of the
value of what we may call the “class
appeal.” He w T ill address one type of citizen
with a grotesque assumption of gentility—
his manner and accent palpably plagiarised
from the music-hall performer who pre-
sents the British aristocrat in purple dress
clothes, a velvet waistcoat and a plethora
of diamond rings—-and will affect to see in
his prey one who was “in the same form as
me at Oxford,” or who “rowed in the eleven
at Harrow College.” To another type he
will posture as a squatter ruined by Social-
istic legislation. To a third he may be an
honest working-man who has been ground
beneath the relentless heel of Capitalism.
A complete original was Frank Bunn
Dodgson—so-called. My own name is Bunn
Dodgson, and I might have been felled by
a brick without resistance, such was my
surprise, when Frank entered and intro-
duced himself as my cousin. He was not
the sort of cousin that any man would greet
with pride. He looked as though he had
been carefully brushed down and tidied up
after sleeping in a park. In his right hand
he carried a cane : in his left a preposterous
little straw hat with an infinitesimal brim.
He was small and hopeful-looking, and he
absolutely radiated futility.
“I am your cousin Frank,” he said, “and
I am newly arrived from Victoria.”
He struck me as a really worthy performer
in his line, so I inquired why he had come to
Sydney.
“In Victoria,” he said sadly, “I lost my
poor wife —lost her in a carriage accident.
My grief was terrible. For six months I
was in Kew lunatic asylum, and my
chances of recovery were but slight. But
Time heals, Time heals, and now here we
are, well and hearty, and ready to face the
world once more.”
I asked him how he made out that he
was my cousin.
“I am a member,” he intoned musically,
“of an old Devonshire branch of the family.
Father came from Devonshire; Grandfather
came from Devonshire ; and GREAT-Grand-
father came from Devonshire. In fact, we
all come from Devonshire.”
I said: “How about the ‘Bunn’ in your
name? Where do you get that?”
As a matter of fact, my family is of hum-
ble origin. We do not hark back to county
ancestors in England. The “Bunn” part
of our name is there as a compliment to an

THE EVER-READY HEALER
AND PERFECT SKIN-CURE.
IN the course of her duties the nurse is
brought into contact with every descrip-
tion of skin disease. She is also brought
to fully realise the need for a reliable healing
balm which can be applied to diseased and
wounded skin with every confidence that
only good will result.
The fact that hundreds of nurses use
Zam=Buk in the course of their
duties is further proof, if such were
needed, that in Zam = Buk the public
is furnished with a reliable healing
balm and skin=cure, the purity and
power of which cannot be denied.

Nurse Opray, residing \t 31 King Street
Prahran, Melbourne, adds her name to the
already long list of professional practitioners
who speak in praise of Zamßuk. “1 suffered
from a terribly bad hand,” says the nurse,
“which was caused through knocking it against
a door. Inflammation set in, my hand ’’com-
menced to swell up. and the pain was so great
I could do nothing with it. I was out nursing
at the time, but I was forced to give it up. All
the remedies I tried failed to do anv good, and
at the end of three months my hand was’ get-
ting worse instead of better. A friend advised
me to use Zam-Buk. The benefit 1 derived
from the first few applications was very encour-
aging. After a while the wound was cleansed
and purified, and the healing process rapidlv
set in. New healthy skin grew over the wound,
and my hand was as sound and strong as ever!
I recommend it to all.”

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

influential god-pai'ent. I awaited the im-
postor’s reply, accordingly, with some in-
terest.
“How shall I tell you?” he chanted with
an affable smile. “It goes back to the inner-
most recesses of history. Father was named
Bunn; grandfather was named Bunn;
GREAT”
I stopped him at this stage and asked
what, precisely, I could do for him.
“I come as a relative, my dear Mr. Dodg-
son,” he said, “on a matter of some deli-
cacy. I wish to go to Goulburn. I also
owe a trifling sum at my hotel —a matter of
£3. Could you oblige me with my fare to
Goulburn and a trifling sum over —say, a
fiver?”
It amused me considerably to answer,
with an air of elaborate gloom, as follows:
“Mi 1 . Dodgsmi; or if I may call you so, in
view of our relationship, Frank, I am sorry
for you. Your accurate knowledge of the
inside details of my family history has con-
vinced me that we are cousins. But by that
very achievement you bind my hands. Have
you forgotten the very first rule, pledge or
undertaking of the Dodgson family, the
obligation which was first imposed on our
line by Cantenac Bunn Dodgson, at Elsen-
ham, near Stansted-Mount-Fichet, circa
1124?’!
He gave slightly at the knees, fumbled
with his absurd hat, and showed other signs
of uneasiness.
“For the moment, my dear- —er —Joseph,”
he replied, “I have.”
“You forget,”* I said amazedly, “the oath
sworn by every Dodgson, on reaching man’s
estate, namely, that under no circumstances
will he either give, advance, hand, tender,
convey, pass or lend money to any member
of tliq, Dodgson family, alive or dead, so
help me God?”
My relative's* broken appearance showed
that be had indeed forgotten. Recovering
himself with an effort he said mournfully:
"It is evident, Mr. Dodgson, that you
cannot pay my fare to Goulburn. Can you
at least tell me the way to Goulburn?”
“Down the stairs; turn to your left; and
• keep straight on,” I said amiably, and a
novel variety of fraud vanished from my
life, as I hope, for ever.
The only cadger that I remember to have
given to with complete goodwill came from
Adelaide. He blew cheerily in on a day
wlien the sun was shining and the bii'ds
were singing and I was in moderately good
spirits, and asked for the price of a cigar
and a lunch at Baris House. Pressed for
explanations, he mentioned, in a matter-of-
fact way, that he had just come out of
gaol, that the food there was rotten, that
he had not eaten decent food since he re-
gained his freedom, that he had seen me in
the street and summed me up as one who
would not grudge a man a meal —and hence
bis presence. lie talked with abandoned
readiness about his misdeeds. He had been
a solicitor. In this capacity he had pur-
loined trust funds, and had also done a bit
of forgery. He didn’t ascribe his downfall
to betting, wine or women. He had sim-
ply formed the view that dishonesty was the
best policy, and had behaved accordingly,
lie made no pretence of being a reformed
character. I gathered vaguely that he meant
to take down the trusting in the future as
in the past. He was so utterly different
from every other swindling solicitor and ex-
solicitor that I had met that I took to
him. He was free from the cant of the pro-
fession. lie was a typical attorney of a
certain class, and an admitted thief. I gave
him 3s. for his lunch and coffee; Is. 6d. for
a bottle of lager; 6d. for a cigar and 6d.
for the waiter —in all ss. Gd. —and having
first extracted from him an oath that he
would never approach, address or in any
other way molest me again, I saw him off
the premises.
Of course, he was back in a week. That
is one of the marks of the congenital cadger.
He always comes back to the fools who
encourage him, till the grave or an indeter-
minate sentence closes over his head.

The Green Kangaroo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE carpenter asked for a day off. lie
| drew his salary for the past six
months, and went into Condobolin
with the view of buying a yearling. The
boundary-rider, who was a judge of horses,
went with him. They were to return the
same night, but the boundai-y-rider came
back six days later with a chastened air and
the manner of one who has been shaken,
and an incoherent account of nothing in
particular.
Days passed, and at the end of the seven-
teenth the carpenter made an unobtrusive
appearance without the colt. The return
was so unobtrusive, in fact, that at first we
only had a sense of his presence. We told
each other that “Jim was back,” without
being able to say we had seen him. A spirit
essence of the carpenter seemed to hang
around in the dim perspective.
That evening the schoolmaster came to
the men's hut. as he often did. and recited
“How We Beat the Favorite.” In the
middle of it Jim sidled in and sat down in
the manner of one who tries to look natural
and at his ease. 11 is hair was in knots, and
he was covered with flakes of dried blood.
When the schoolmaster had finished Jim
stood up on a pair of indeterminate legs and
said: “I'll give you a bit of a recitation.”
Then he looked at the stringy bark which
still clung to the saplings on the roof, and
then he looked at his feet as if he were trying
to recollect something. At last he said:
Anon you hear ees thupple song
Re-echo in the kurrawong.
Then he looked up at the rafters again
and said simply: “Adam Lindsay Gordon,”
and sat down.
‘"ls that all.” asked the rouseabout,
disgustedly.
“I disremember the rest.” said Jim.
The rouseabout spat vehemently and said.
"You look as if you'd been dragged through
a barbed-wire feme."
“He looks as if he’d been dragged through
forty bloomin’ fences,” said Alick.
“So would yens if you’d ’ad a go in with
a green kangaroo,” said Jim.
“A green grandmother,” said the rouse-
about.
Jim raised himself three inches from his
seat with one fist clenched and the light of
battle in his eyes. “Was you there?” he
asked. v
The rouseabout subsided. “No,” he said.
“Well, shut up,” said Jim, fiercely.
There was a silence at this point, and the
schoolmaster, who was rather ladylike,
quietly slipped away. Jim ruminated for a
time.
“Not that I blame yous for not believin’
me,” he said at length. “Wouldn’t have
believed it meself if 1 hadn’t seen it.”
“Where was it, Jim?” asked Alick.
“Down be the Five-mile Gate,” said Jim.
“It was settin’ lookin’ round about fifty-
yards back from the track. I says to meself,
I says, ‘Cripes, that's a green kangaroo,’ and
I went acrost to make sure. It was bright
green, like young grass. Cheeky damn thing
too. Wouldn’t shift, and let me get right
up, and I gave it a punch in the jaw to make
it get a move on. You mightn’t believe me,
but the blame thing closed with me.”
He reviewed the occurrence retrospectively
for a few minutes.
“Gum!” he continued, “it was like
wrastling with a rose bush.”
“Was it that what scratched yer?” asked
the rouseabout.
Jim nodded. “You see, it didn’t have hair
like other kangaroos. It was covered with
spikes like a priekly-pear tree. I’d rather
wrastle a man enny day.”
“What became of it. Jim?” asked Alick.
“I don't know. I didn’t wait to see. I
made a bee-line for home, you bet,” he said.
“Home’s good enough for me. First time I
ever see a green kangaroo, and I don’t want
to see another. Wonder if there’s enny
charnce of gettin’ some grub.”
Alick went over with him, and the cook
gave him some bread and meat, which he
wolfislily gulped.
“Did you buy that colt, .Tim?” asked the
cook.
Jim ignox-ed the question by asking
another: "Does tiie boss know I’m back?”
“Yes, I heai'd the girls tell him.”
Jim lost his appetite and looked uncom-
fortable. “Well, he can only sack me, and#
he won’t get another bloke as good a
carpenter, and a bloke is not a slave
enny way. A bloke wants a holiday once in
a way. I'd rather chuck the bloomin’ job
than not have a ’oliday once in a way; and,
enny way, I’m sick of the job. It's no cop
with green kangaroos all over the runs.”
“I thought there was only one,” said
Alick.
“Well, that’s all I saw, but it stands to
sense that where thei-e’s one there’s more.
They breed, I s’pose. It’s not the fact of it
bein’ bright green as on account of the
thorns it's got for hair that I object to.
Ennyway, I’m goin’ to light out for another
station to-morrer.”
But Jim didn't go. For days he haunted
remote spots where the boss wouldn’t be
likely to find him. He did little bits of
unauthorised work with furtive glances in
all directions, and if he saw the squatter he
vanished.
At last the squatter ran him to earth and
had a long talk to him, Jim looking like a
boy who had been caught stealing apples.
“And now.” said the boss when he had
said all he wanted to say, “you can start
work, and let us have no more 'of those jags.”
“I’ll promise you faithfully, sir, that it
won’t occur again,” said Jim.
“And I want to hear no more nonsense
about green kangaroos.” said the boss.
“Well, you know, sir,” said Jim. “seein's
believin’.”
The boss set him with a keen stare. “Is
it?” he asked.
Jim changed his resting leg to the other
one and looked down, and then around at
the landscape with unseeing eyes, and at
length he said :
“I don't know.”
ROBERT BROTHERS.
Nothing at All.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[LEANT my arms on the grey sea-wall,
A listless fellow, one sunlit day ;
With eyes on the gulls and the surf at
play,
And thinking, I fancy, of nothing at all.
O nothing-at-all is a theme to please;
Tis hard to catch, and harder to keep ;
But once ’tis captured, ’tis sweet as sleep
When limbs, grown weary, are stretched at
ease.
I should have been thinking of monev. no
doubt.
Of verses and stories to sing and to write;
But how could I do it—with magical light.
The sea and the scent of the sea all about?
I hearkened the song of the wave and the
wind
f'Tis little they chorus of board and of bed)
I said to myself. ‘'When all is said
The mind at rest is the perfect mind.”
Away in the west was the smoke of the
town.
And heat and energy, haste and care.
And the long, long streets, where, pair bv
pair,
Grey Trouble and Toil go up and down.
Their fine spray gleaming with rainbow-fire,
I watched the waves on the shining sands •
I said. ‘ Mind lazy and lazy hands—
M hat sweeter thing could a man desire?”
What sweeter thing—then the sounding sea
Grew mute and distant, and 10, behold!
U ith borrowed light, but its own true gold,
tier rich hair shone as she greeted me.
I leant no more on the grey sea-wall.
No more I hearkened the breakers’ beat:
She said, “How strange!” but I said “How
sweet!”
And away on the wind went Nothing-at-all
x.s.w.
