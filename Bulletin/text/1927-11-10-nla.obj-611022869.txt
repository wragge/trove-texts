The Red Page
To Australia
Australia, mother, at whose shrine I burned
The hallowed fires of first affections mild,
My lodestar still in paths desert and
wild,
How oft to thee in yearning have I turned!
Yet thou hast seen me prisoned, scourged
and spurned,
Hast stood aside with folded hands, and
smiled,
When strangers, lying, have my name
reviled,
And my fair fame in obloquy inurned.
Still I despair not, I will win thy heart.
By pardon craved? No, God be judge!
Not mine
To prove recreant to my nobler part
And stain for mean applause a gift divine;
My name will rise unspotted from the
mart,
And in thy firmament a beacon shine.

The Soviet Year Book, 1927
Soviet Russia has advanced to the
dignity of issuing a Year Book, which,, as
a matter of fact, is now in its third number.
It is intimated, however, that the earlier
numbers were comparatively humble
efforts. Even the present publication runs
to only 453 small pages, while Australia’s
annual official volume contains 1038 large
ones. The Muscovite book shows every
sign of being official, yet it is printed in
London and in the English language, by
the private and capitalistic enterprise of
Allen and Unwin, Ltd. It may therefore
be assumed that it is more an effort to
impress the foreigner and pave the way for
a loan than an attempt to instruct the
native. Presumably it contains some truth
to facilitate the sale, and a great deal of
the other thing to facilitate the loan.
It may be described as a mixture of
whitewash and eyewash, with traces of hog-
wash. As an example there is this opening
statement: —
Since the time of the formation of the Soviet
Republics the States of the world have divided into
two camps; the camp of Capitalism and the camp
of Socialism.... There, in the camp of Capitalism,
are national enmity and inequality, colonial slavery
and chauvinism, national oppression and pogroms,
imperial brutalities and wars. Here, in the camp of
Socialism, are mutual confidence and peace, national
freedom and equality, a dwelling together in peace
and the brotherly collaboration of peoples.
Wherefore it is curious to read further on
that the country is to a great but indefinite
extent under martial law to prevent the
peaceful and collaborated people rising
against the happy State and burning the
Socialistic camp. The military tribunals
deal with people suspected of counter-
revolutionary ideas, espionage, desertion
from the compulsory-sei vice army, theft,
non-fulfilment of agreements with State
enterprises and falsification of documents;
and “provided there is no other law court
on the spot,” they deal with people charged
with anything at all. Obviously there will
be no other court on the spot if the tribunal
selects a spot where there is no other court.
No information is given about the number
of people tried and sentenced by the mili-
tary tribunals, or the size of the sentences;
in fact, there is a strange lack of informa-
tion about prisons, prisoners, tortures and
executions, and there is even an absence of
news about the police system, which is
possibly past explaining away. The new
criminal code, it appears, is in so many
chapters; but what on earth is in the
chapters?
Wages are continually rising, the year’s
pay of a full-grown Russian being £6O 13s.
in 1926 as against £l9 2s. 6d. in 1923. Other
good things have also gone up. The allow-
ance for a confinement (a sort of baby
bonus) has been raised from 21s. 3d. to
345., and a nursing mother gets Bs. 6d. per
month. The sickness insurance depart-
ment used to pay the worker in full for one
year or part of a year during temporary in-
capacity; but then it was found necessary
to reduce the allowance—the book doesn’t
say by how much.
Divorce, or “cessation of marriage,” is
simple. A divorce is granted when both
parties drop into the office and ask for it,
or when one asks for it. The only time
it isn’t granted is when neither party asks
for it.
The Government railway system doesn’t
pay expenses. It isn’t required to pay
interest on the loan funds with which it was
constructed, for they have been repudiated.
For 1925 the deficit was £1,300,000 in round
numbers, and leaving out the small change.
For 1926 it was £23,500,000. Considering
the low rate of wages this is remarkably
poor, and considering that the book sup-
plies figures for the year before the war,
showing that the railways then yielded a
surplus of £19,500,000, it is a remarkably
bad testimonial. It is mentioned on another
page that over 45 per cent, of the loco-
motives, 16 per cent, of the goods waggons
and 51 per cent, of the passenger carriages
are out of repair. An explanation is
appended:—
The war and civil wars had a very destructive
effect on the rolling stock.
France and Belgium and Serbia, which
suffered wholesale destruction, don’t whine
about their damaged engines and carriages
and trucks like this, nor do they say that
affairs deteriorated in 1926 because the
war finished in 1918.
The chapter on finance alleges that the
Soviet Government has contrived for the
last three years to pay its way. There
wasn’t, it seems, a penny over or a penny
short. It might be added that a country
which has so little war damage to
repair, and no indemnities to meet, which
pays no interest on any debt incurred until
about four years ago, which enriched itself
by the seizure of so very much property,
which did such a vast repudiation of its
own paper money, and which poses as such
a dashed superior Government, should be
able to pay its way. But so far from doing
so in reality, it appears that the Soviet
concern has floated eight internal loans
(and it is known that they were mostly
raised under compulsion) since 1922, in
addition to a mass of Treasury bills. The
transactions include two 8 per cent, loans
and two “peasant loans” and amount to
over £75,000,000.
A few brief remarks about the military
situation explains that a force of 562,000
men is under arms, and that every man
who isn’t under arms is in some degree
under training.
The chapter dealing with government
shows how the people, on a suffrage not
defined, elect lots of petty Soviets, and
these create condensed Soviets, and the
process goes on till a two-House Legis-
lature emerges somehow or other.
Altogether the book, taken in detail,
hardly lives up to the glowing preface, but
then the preface glows so much that an
inspired volume and a community of saints
could scarcely live up to it.
J. E.
Roy Bridges, Novelist
I read with interest Mr. Sayers’s article on
Roy Bridges (R.P. 29/9/’27), but was sur-
prised and disappointed to find that he was
described as a writer of boys’ books. “Is he
really a writer of boys’ books at all?” I asked
myself, scorning grammar, as we do when
we speak to ourselves. That question can
only be answered by boys, and I am no
longer qualified— not by half a century.
But I was a boy once, and I remember the
sort of books I read in those days. Cer-
tainly a motley collection, including most of
the British classics which I couldn’t read
now. But what were known in those days
as boys’ books were written by Marryat,
Mayne Read,'Kingston and Jules Verne. I
was grown up before I read “Treasure
Island” with delight, but I have never found
that it ranks very high among boys’
favorites and didn’t in my young days. I
am wondering whether such books of Roy
Bridges as “Rogues’ Haven,” “Rats’ Castle”
and the like, which your contributor con-
siders the novelist’s masterpieces, scorning
even reference to his other more serious
novels, are really boys’ books at all, and
further, the question might be asked, What
are boys’ books?
I should prefer, and doubtless Mr. Bridges
would prefer, to be known as the author of
“Merchandise,” the story of a boy who
grows to manhood during a droughty period
on the Mallee and finds himself thus early
confronted, not only with the problems of
financial disaster, but also with questions of
deep emotional import in regard to his
mother, who has deserted his dissolute father
to live with a well-to-do man who loves
her; or as the author of “Green Butterflies,”
in which a youth has to deal with an equally
difficult problem brought about by the dis-
covery that he is illegitimate; or “Gates of
Birth,” a somewhat similar story; or “A
Mirror of Silver,” a grim record of the taint
of hereditary sexuality, persisting through
four generations—the last three admirably
written and emotionally felt novels, with
English and Australian backgrounds, which
have achieved three or four editions in Eng-
land and America. And to these must be
added Mr. Bridges’s literary masterpiece,
“The Vats of Tyre,” a vivid and colorful
tale of Judsea in the time of Christ, whose
personality and influence pervade the whole
story.
It is these books that have won Mr.
Bridges his high reputation in other coun-
tries if not in his own. It may be further
interesting to know that his latest novel,
“Through Another Gate,” with its scene laid
in London and Kent at the present day, as
the result of his visit to England last year,
is about to be published, and that he has
given up journalism to devote himself
entirely to fiction.

Inversion
Human behavior may be said to depend
on two factors, on the bodily and mental
equipment with which an individual is pro-
vided, and on the surroundings in which that
equipment is brought to light, elaborated
and used. A recent medical writer sought to
prove that most, if not all, human activities
are the product of what is known as the
endocrine system—the thyroid gland, the
suprarenal body, the pituitary gland and the
ovaries and testes in females and males re-
spectively. If this view were accepted in its
entirety, no man could be blamed for any
course of action; anything that he did would
be the result of the balance existing at the
moment between the various glands. The
mind, the will and the results of upbringing
must, however, be considered, for bodily
structure may predestine an individual to a
certain mental outlook and a corresponding

line of conduct, but the will may be trained
in a large measure to act as a controlling
force.
Although the typical male person is essen-
tially different from the typical female,
everyone recognises the existence of man-
nish women and effeminate men. The
existence of these types depends on an
unusual form of glandular activity; there is
an undue predominance of one or more of
the endocrine glands. When the sexual out-
look of the individual is considered, it is
found that the mannishness and femininity
may proceed to an extreme degree, and we
thus recognise normal heterosexual and
abnormal homosexual persons. A homo-
sexual person is one who, though apparently
normal, is susceptible to the emotional and
sexual attraction only of his or her own sex.
The subject of homosexuality is generally
numbered among the taboos and hence is
more often than not misunderstood. The
homosexual person is regarded as degraded,
vicious and perverted, one who has chosen
an evil path and trodden it to minister to
his own lust. If a moment’s thought be
given to the endocrine relationships pre-
viously mentioned, it will be seen that the
homosexual is worthy of study, that he is
more to be pitied than blamed and that
there are probably ways in which he can
be helped. These points are brought into
prominence in a remarkable and, be it said,
long overdue book: The Invert and His
Social Adjustment, by “Anomaly” (Balli&re,
Tindall and Cox).
The author, himself an invert (hence the
nom de plume), states his case in a manner
which is at once earnest and sincere. He has
written with two objects: the first has to
do with other inverts like himself, the
second concerns all students of human
nature. The latter may be considered first.
The author distinguishes sharply between
bisexuality and homosexuality. These are
often confused, though as a blatter of fact
the bisexual person is not in so hopeless a
plight as his homosexual relative. In
“Anomaly’s” opinion the invert’s condition is
either congenital or it dates from the dawn
of sex-consciousness, and persists throughout
the subject’s life, unless a cure can be found.
Apart from the difference in sexual stimu-
lation, invert psychology is exactly parallel
to normal psychology, and the author bases
most of his arguments on “the theory of
parallels.” The unbiased thinker must surely
agree that this is just. Homosexuality is
necessarily a safely guarded secret of the
person affected, and the “flagrant inverts of
the police-court” are not typical examples
of inversion. They are those who have
fallen in the struggle with their peculiar
temptations. They correspond to the hetero-
sexual delinquent who is called upon to
defend himself against a charge of a sexual
nature, and all heterosexual persons are
not regarded as being on the same level as
the heterosexual offender.
The truth of the matter is that the vast
majority of homosexual persons are decent,
self-restrained members of the community.
They are unhappy because they realise their
unfortunate abnormality, an abnormality
which imposes upon them need for life-long
self-control. What was written of “self-
reverence, self - knowledge, self - control”
applies to homosexuals and heterosexuals
alike. The building of character depends
chiefly on self-control, and it follows that
the homosexual, from the very fact that he
has to fight for self-control more than any
other person, may possibly achieve strength
of character surpassing the average.
The valor of homosexuals in the late war
was not less than that of normally endowed
persons (“Anomaly” stresses this fact), and
in civil pursuits they can undoubtedly play
a man’s part. The message of “Anomaly”
to the serious student of the subject is thus
a plea for understanding. Understanding
assuredly calls forth sympathy, and sym-
pathy to the abnormal in mental outlook, no
less than to the sick in body, brings com-
fort, encouragement and hope.
To the invert the author appeals for self-
reliance and continence, for that training of
the will to which reference has already been
made. Among the normals and the homo-
sexuals there are saints and profligates.
“Between those who have achieved sanctity
and those who have chosen vice will be
found the larger number, struggling sinners,
whose faltering progress is marked by many
a pitiful tumble.” To this large group of
inverts is the advice in this book addressed.
The author puts the whole matter on the
highest possible plane; he is evidently a
devout Roman Catholic and accepts the
decrees of his Church. He holds, and holds
rightly,'that the problem of invert morality
is part of the general question of sexual
morality. Apart from being a psychological
study of social importance, this book may
serve as a moral lesson to all who read it.
P.B.M.
The Vulgarity of Modern Art
It is perhaps rather late in the day to call
those childish splashes of color that recently
duped the world “modem” art; rather, they
were “pre-modern,” for the influence is
fast dying. One has merely to glance
through any imported art journal to see
the titanic struggle of the iconoclasts to
patch up the idols of sound draughtsman-
ship and true painting which, not so very
long ago, they were foamingly eager to
knock down in a loud-voiced, bad-
mannered way. Australia, always behind
the times in such matters, seems to be
getting the last erratic kick. A recent
Sydney exhibition (purporting to be repre-
sentative of Australian art) hung a great
many of these garish monstrosities. N obody,
of course, troubles if such people want to
make fools of themselves as long as they
keep within the stone walls of their peculiar
asylums; but it is very annoying indeed to
be temporarily blinded by a shrieking splash
of green or scarlet or yellow or blue, and so
be made unable to view the really interest-
ing works —the ultra-refinement of George
Lambert, for instance, the lyrical mystery
of Elioth Gruner’s paint, or the impeccable
realism of Hans Heysen. These and three
or four other excellent painters were well
represented, but were nearly murdered by
their surroundings. That is my only annoy-
ance with “modern 1 ' art. If the dastardly
perpetrators wish their rubbish hung (and
I’m sure nobody else does), why can t they
hang them where sensible people needn’t
see them?
A notable thing about these would-be
prophets is that, although they never tire
of squealing about “posterity/’ they them-
selves hardly ever trouble to buy the rub-
bish. If, as they persist in shouting, these
wasted canvases will be invaluable gold-
mines in years to come, why don’t they
grab them now when they’re going for a
song? But they don’t, and that was the
only refreshing thing about the exhibition.
Most of the really fine work was bought
instantly, and the daubs remained without
that little red wafer on their frames so
cheering to the eyes of an artist.
The chief password of these “modernists”
is the word “refinement,” The world, they
say, is too unrefined to appreciate the
aristocratic beauties of red bellowing next
to a yellow, or a decaying woman on the
point of gestation. Thank God for that!
If refinement meant such things, there
would be an immediate pilgrimage to the
gutter to escape such a fate. Fortunately,
however, it means nothing of the kind.
But what exactly is “modern” art without
its gabble of “isms”? Its exponents talk
a great deal, but very little sense can be
filtered from their incoherency. It appears
they are trying to give their subconscious
minds full play. But that will not explain
their disorder and repulsiveness. For all
art is intrinsically the work of the sub-
conscious. From that mysterious store-
house comes the strange morbidezza that
raises a painting so high above a mere
photograph. What it is is inexplicable;
artists themselves may believe it to be the
few tricks they have acquired with such
great labor. Certainly those tricks are the
foundation, and art cannot exist without
them; but beneath the layer of paint, the
perfect draughtsmanship, the color, the
technique of a Rubens, a Titian or a
Turner canvas there moves, eternally alive,
the mystery of art, the bewildering, esoteric
beauty. It comes from the subconscious;
just as the witchery of poetry, however
courageously fought for, also moves from
the subconscious.
If, however, the subconscious produces
only a gabble of violent, meaningless color
and foetid forms, I personally would be
rather ashamed of it and not dare to parade
it before the public.
L. PHILLIPS.
Science and the Soul
The science of life is comparable to a
department store; the head of one depart-
ment having often the poorest and most
unreliable information about other
branches of the business. Thus, a London
cable not only quotes Dr. Barnes, the
Bishop of Birmingham, as making the
blundering statement that Darwin asserted
that man was descended from apes —what
he did say was that man and the anthro-
poids had a common ancestor —but quotes
Sir Arthur Keith as saying: “The soul
can only be regarded as a function of the
brain.” This may have been the cableman’s
error; for facts, so far as known, suggest
that the brain is a late evolutionary pro-
duct of the directing soul.
In later life Darwin had to abandon his
theory of evolution as first stated —that a
personal variation favorable to the survival
of the parent w T as likely to be transmitted
to the child. It may, and often is, trans-
mitted to a later generation, but not to the
child; for the parent is only a carrier, not
a former of the offspring.
Every living cell has a directing intelli-
gence personal to itself; at its death it has
a different chemical reaction. Something
has gone from it. There is no doubt of
that, although so far the intelligence can
be detected only by results. A half-century
ago the aggressive scientist could find no
reality but matter composed of the indivi-
sible atom. To-day he finds that matter,
the atom and the elements are only a ques-
tion of temperature, and have no more
substance or reality than the shadow of a
shade. The seeming reality with con-
tinuity is the intelligence of the living cell
and its evolving form in co-operative asso-
ciations. It carries its knowledge acquired
by experience from life-form to life-form
by what we term “instinct” that acts with
speed automatically. In a few of the
highest life-forms the soul has evolved a
brain with power to reason—a power, so far
as developed, much slower to operate than
instinct.
Instinctive memory is subconscious, and
in its operation and power to act as the
result of past experiences no line of demar-
cation can as yet be drawn between the
single self-sufficing cell —invisible to the
naked eye—and its highest and most com-
plicated aggregates.
The wise scientist, having been so mis-
taken in his often quite positive material-
istic interpretation of facts, has for a long
time been very shy of generalising on the
new discoveries; but it seems desirable that
the public generally should know what is
going on and that materialism as under-
stood 30 years ago is as dead as the dodo.
H.F.
Eight Months to Go
Within a week of the announcement of
The Bulletin's £l7OO Prize Novel Compe-
tition, the first bundle of MS. arrived at
the office; and since then it has been joined
in the safe by a few others. But these are
works, of course, that the writers had on
hand { they rushed them along to get early
in the queue for the £5OO first prize that is
to be awarded wdthin a few weeks of the
closing of the first competition on June 30
next.
From what The Bulletin can gather,
the Gloria or some other light is being con-
sumed in a hundred back-country homes
in Australia in a laudable effort to win
this prize and all that it means besides
in the way of fame and profit; and no
doubt almost every professional and semi-
professional story-writer in Australia will
“have a shot at it.” There is one thing
in particular about the competition which
seems to be generally approved—no man’s
style (and no woman’s) is cramped. The
competitor must be either Australian-born
or bona fide resident in Australia (Aus-
tralia meaning also Maori land and the
South Pacific), but beyond that there are
practically no limiting conditions. The
story need not even be Australian in
setting, though this Page will be horribly
disappointed if the competition does not
produce many printable stories with an
Australian background.
The competition has attracted a great
deal of attention in England and in the
U.S.A.; and in England especially the size
of the prizes has been commented upon
wonderingly. Incidentally, many compli-
mentary things have been said about The
Bulletin; but that doesn’t matter. One
large American firm has got in early with
an offer to publish the prize story, and it
suggests terms very alluring to the winner;
but, while this is very gratifying, no
arrangement of the sort will be entered into
beforehand. The successful writers can
make their own arrangements with both
European and American publishers; the
profits on such book publication, by the
way, will belong wholly to the writers.
Naturally The Bulletin hopes that the
competition will produce a fine crop of
great, stories; and, to that end, if anybody
desires any further information about the
competition, The Bulletin will be glad to
supply it.
A Satchel of Books
Air. Essinfiton hi Love, by J. Storer Clous-
ton (John Lane). Readers of “The Lunatic
at Large” and “The Lunatic m Charge
will know wliat to expect in the present
novel. Has all the robustious go of ita
predecessors.
Simon the Jester, by W. J. Locke (John
Lane). A cheap reprint.
The Royal Embassy, by lan F. M. Lucas.
The writer, a Reuter correspondent, accom-
panied the Yorks on their Australasian tour,
and gives a full and amply illustrated
account of the journey.
Alchnaton, King of Egypt, by Dmitri
Merezliovsky (Dent). This Russian writer
continues the story begun in “The Birth of
the Gods.” Against the background ot
ancient Egypt he sets a highly dramatic
picture with vivid contrasts.
Fifty Years of Spoof, by Arthur Roberts
(John Lane). “Arthur, why don’t you write
your reminiscences?” said Augustus John.
“If you do,” he added, “I will do your por-
trait.” So it came about that the comedian
wrote and the great artist limned him with
the result that here is a book which all sur-
viving playgoers of London’s past lialt-
century will welcome.
Makers of Nineteenth-century Europe, by
Ralph Flenley (Dent). Here the Associate
Professor of Modern History in the Univer-
sity of Toronto develops the political his-
tory of the past century by selecting typical
figures of statesmen and national leaders as
subjects for biographic treatment —Metter-
nich, Mazzini, Kossuth, Garibaldi, Cavour,
Bismarck, Gambetta aiul others. That his
list does not include figures from the history
of Britain the author explains on the ground
that, although the British people led the way
in the development of popular government,
her history followed a course of gradual
political and social evolution which could
not without distortion be fitted into the plan
of Continental European history—a postu-
late for which the Red Page can find little
support.
Lotus of the Dust, by Dorothy Graham
(Fisher Unwin). This “novel of present-day
China” is of interest on account of its back-
ground and its sketenes of student-plotting
and social life among the foreign population
in Pekin, rather than because of any special
merit in plot or construction. The author
sees in the revolutionary agitation, ‘ perhaps
not the florescence of a New China, but the
leaven of an old order working again. the
Manclius are quite willing to play at revo-
lution. but not from any motives of genuine
altruism. “Astutely they are building for
their own advantage, for a return to the
previous status, when they had been lords ot
the earth.”
Later Greek Religion, by Edwyn Sevan
(Dent). A volume of “The Library of
Greek Thought” series. The author surveys
the Greek field following the Macedonian
conquest in the fourth century B.c. Jhe
effect of the conquest was to make Greek
culture dominant over a far larger area, and
when, in process of time, all the countries
round the Mediterranean came .to form a
single State under Roman jurisdiction, it
was the literature and art of the Greeks
which everywhere shaped education and
“gave men their system of intellectual con-
cepts and their standards of value. A book
of interest not only to the student, but to
readers desirous of learning the influence of
pagan thought upon the formative period of
the Christian religion.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Ballad of Three.
We loved her far too well.
For this we fought;
And at his hand I fell
And love was naught.
Far up and down the night,
By wind and wave,
I walked in sheeted white
From my lone grave.
For me her soft tears fell
On the crude clay;
For she had words to tell
And prayers to pray.
Far up and down the land
He came and went,
By his blood-lusting hand
Made ill content.
And sometimes o’er the grass
He, she and I
In the dark night would pass—
A threefold sigh.
Turning from him, she wept
Only for me;
But I, while night winds crept,
Could weep for three.
A swift and foolish word
Beneath the wall,
The pricking of a sword—
And that was all.
I fell; and he and she
Lived on in death,
Drawing the curse of me
With every breath.
And sometimes o’er the grass
In wind or rain
Through the dark night we pass—-
A threefold pain.
Oh man, forget your deed,
Your hand forgive !
I could not help but bleed;
I could not live.
Girl of my heart, pass by!
I could not save
The doom that I should lie
In a small grave.
Idle my words and vain.
She cannot hear,
Nor he have rest of pain
And ease of fear.
Oh friends, I love you vcell;
But woe is this
To know that though I fell
You may not kiss.
I have not sought a tear
Nor asked a sigh ;
Yet, dead to love and fear,
I may not die.
For this must ever be,
Come ruth, come rue :
Whom God created three
No sword makes two.

Shimmering sky, and a light wind blowir.
I itfully over the plain
Where the long grass ripples, and, green!
glowing,
Settles to stillness again ;
The old grey barn with the half-door sliov,
ing
Sunlight warm on the grain,
And the mud-brick house, and the plum-tre<
snowing
upon it; the lane
W here a line of poplars, tall, close-growing
Twists round the slope to gain
The swift brown creek in the hollow flowing
Swollen with last week’s rain....
Fool, fool, I that am going
Away from it all in the train ;
Citywards, south, in the train !

Moon-set.
In among the grasses
The midnight wind blew chill
(I smell the wild leaf-perfumes
And the soil-odors still),
Out at moon-set, Nina,
On the dewy hill.
Only those who’ve stolen
Secretly, and kissed.
Who have met and lain long
In a pale moon-mist,
Glean the guilty glamor
Of a midnight tryst.
If Love palls, possessing,
Then this we know,
We are not regretting
That ours could not grow
Out of adolescence,
Girl of Long Ago!
In among the grasses
The midnight wind blew chill
(I smell the wild leaf-perfumes
And the soil-odors still),
Out at moon-set, Nina,
Down the dewy hill!
QUEENSLAND.
E. M. ENGLAND.
Teams of Edithclare.
Red clods are touched with autumn frost
and leaves are wet with dew,
And trustful hearts are all astir to face the
task anew.
Above the range where fondly gleamed a
gracious morning star
1 he hidden sun’s illuming rays are questing
t high and far.
While smoke imbues a cloudless sky from
cheery hearths aflare.
Hands spread abundant fodder for the teams
of Editliclare.
While magpie voices greet the sun that
kindles roof and tree,
They face afield from yard and shed, heads
, high and striding free;
They pace in fours or eight abreast, each
team its plot to find,
While treading each a beaten track, the
homestead roofs behind.
The slopes are dressed and swept for seed,
the flats are combed and bare,
And morning calls them out to sow the fields
of Editliclare.
All yoked apace, they breast the slopes that
rise in comely sweep,
They shuffle down the valleyways or tread
the sidelings steep.
The daylight hours are precious now, for
strange are autumn wiles.
And voices urge the ready hoofs to win the
harrowed miles.
They reap the calm of sunlit hours that
days serenely spare
The sowing march triumphant of the teams
of Editliclare.
An every slope a stream of dust is running
dense and low
From hoof and tine and swingle-bar, from
tyre and chain and hoe.
The seed runs in from wheel to wheel in
channels side by side
From laden drills like barges towed across
a ruddy tide.
Low down against the lifting sun which
sheds a dazzling glare,
Ar high along a russet ridge they sow for
Edithclare.
Vnd all the day the grain is set to strike
beneath the loam;
The phosphate runs, the gears revolve till
sunset calls them home.
While down the last returning sweep the
homing horses go,
Pale clouds arise like pollen dust in even-
ing’s afterglow;
Then starlit darkness holds them in, long
slumber hours to share,
Till morning voices stir again the teams of
Edithclare.

GERARDY.
The Changeling.
Beyond your body’s closeness
four soul strays,
Seeking the magic of the far-off days
Imong the dancers on the polished floor,
3r where the scent blows, through an open
door,
Of honeysuckle out of country ways.
[ caught your fluttering hands,
C kissed your mouth ;
But, restless, out of still and secret lands
Irift all the lovely languors of the south,
fou are the conquering child, uncrowned,
unclaimed ;
\las for me, untamed!
The slender pinnacles of Faerie fall
Before your lonely call,
Vnd crushed between your fingers like a
flower
fou hold the key to mystery and song,
While I —well, I have Eden for an hour.

BETTY RIDDELL.
The Sleepers.
All throughout last night
Pine-trees by the beach,
Nodding moonlit heads,
Whispered each to each.
While on shining sands
Waves crept up and down,
Sound the housefolk slept
In the coastal town.
All the town’s lit streets
Still and silent were;
Not a human note,
Not a foot made stir.
From a harbor’s arms
Slyly stealing forth,
Dimly seen, a ship
Slowly headed north.
As she passed by beach,
Reef and rocky height,
Like a pendulum
Swung her masthead light.
While the ship sailed on,
And the seawash crept
Up and down the beach,
Sound the housefolk slept.
While the torch-like pines,
Shining heads asway,
Whispered each to each,
Locked in sleep they lay.

THE UNEXPLOITED MARKET.
Migration, development and research are
the three magic words invariably uttered
■when there is talk of the future of Aus-
tralia, and boards have been set up to in-
vestigate, ponder and report upon the best
way of carrying the trinity into effect.
Not much progress is being made, and no
great degree of progress can be expected
until it is realised that migration must wait
upon development and research on both.
Men of the calibre of H. W. Gepp are well
aware that forced feeding is of no avail.
Uncle Sam in his lusty youth attracted
migrants from all the world over without
stirring a finger, because his industries,
based on the natural resources of the coun-
try and the needs of its population, were
developing themselves so fast that each
new pair of hands was sure to find employ-
ment. Sam’s captains of industry did not
sit down and bewail the fact that the
domestic market was in the hands of the
importers. They said there was a fine big
market right there, and, by Heck, they
were going to have it!
* * * *
Australia has been told by Sam and his
cousin John Bull that this Continent
doesn’t carry a big enough population to
make manufactures worth while, and that it
ought to confine itself to producing food and
other raw materials. This advice has sunk in
so deeply that Australia doesn’t even pro-
duce enough prepared food for its own re-
quirements. Its dairying industry is so small
and so poorly organised that in a “bad
year” it has to import £250,000 worth of
butter from Maoriland. In almost every
year it imports £lOO,OOO worth of cheese
from Switzerland, Holland, Italy and
other countries. Australia lies cheek-by-
jowl with one of the world’s great fishing
grounds, and eats about £2,500,000 worth of
fish in the course of a year. That is whole-
sale valuation. But the little fish that
brings the fisherman a penny in the market
turns up a little later in the fish-shop
ticketed 6d., or, if it has become a fried
fillet, Is. Outside the ports Australian-
caught fish are seldom, if ever, seen —there
is no organisation for transport, distribu-
tion and storage. So the fish trade is
mostly in the hands of the importer, who
brings in £1,000,000 worth of tinned and
£500,000 worth of preserved sea food every
year. Which, as Euclid' would put it in
his abrupt way, is absurd. Australia pays
£325,000 a year for nuts because it doesn’t
take the trouble to grow them, and £BO,OOO
a year for pickles because the local manu-
facturers will make them sweet.
* * * #
And that is only on the food side. Aus-
tralia imports annually £27,000,000 worth of
textiles and clothing (including boots and
shoes), and there is hardly a single item on
the list that can’t be and isn’t being made
in Australia. A little bill comes in annu-
ally for £700,000 for paints and varnishes
and the stuff they are made of; but if the
rest of the world were to sink to-morrow
Australia wouldn’t need to go unpainted
and unvarnished. The country pays out
£45,500,000 a year for metals and metal
manufactures—heavy goods that cost a lot
in freight, and which in many cases of
manufactured imports are made out of
metal that has already paid freight on the
outward journey from this country. We
import £6,000,000 worth of timber and
woodwork each year; £750,000 worth of
crockery; £1,100,000 worth of glassware;
£4,500,000 worth of paper; £275,000 of im-
ported matches; £1,000,000 of pianos. Aus-
tralia could produce a big proportion of all
these things for itself; it has already shown
its ability to produce or manufacture most
of them.
* * * *
The point is that there is a domestic
market well worth developing. One of the
reasons it isn’t developed is that Austra-
lians suffer from an inferiority complex
which restrains them from attempting mass
production; another is the sedulous care
with which John and Sam pander to the
borrowing proclivities of the average
“colonial” politician, for so long as Aus-
tralia borrows it must import in like mea-
sure. Moreover, Australian industry to-day
is in a primitive stage of organisation. But
a recent combination of five engineering
firms for the purpose of manufacturing
automobiles points the way to better things.
Courage, confidence in the country, and
the concentration of manufacturing indus-
try into fewer and bigger units should be
encouraged. The Commonwealth Gov-
ernment can help, if it has vision and faith.
And all Governments can help the primary
industries too, on lines made familiar in
Denmark and Maoriland, by greater insis-
tence on the quality of products. But Gov-
ernments, however well intentioned, can
only help. They can’t do the whole job.
UNITED STATES IMPERIALISM.
W. H. Thompson, the man who makes
even more horrible noises in Chicago than
Lang and Garden make in Sydney, is appa-
rently getting his Britain-hating movement
on a business or war footing. He was many
times mayor of his city, and after a period
of eclipse he got back to his place at the
municipal cash-register on a ticket which
could be condensed into a statement that
George V. must keep his nose out of United
States affairs. He emphasised his attitude
by taking proceedings of some curious sort
against the local superintendent of schools
for not teaching the children to hate the
British Empire with sufficient malignity,
and proceedings had to be taken to prevent
him seizing and burning books (other
people’s books) which say anything even
moderately friendly about Britain. He has
been warmly congratulated by the German
residents; and a new Anglo-Cursing Society
is opening in 15 large cities to begin with,
one of its objects being to distribute anti-
British literature on a grand scale. It is
possible, of course, that Thompson has
really no great objection to Britain but is
merely wondering whether a vigorous ex-
ploitation of anti-British sentiment will
secure him a Presidential nomination. Not
being famous in war, diplomacy, literature
or national politics, an aspiring Thompson
must try something else.
The existence of an anti-British sentiment
is the important thing, and that is obvious
enough; but why it exists isn’t half so
obvious. It can’t be because the United
Kingdom is in the habit of making war
on the republic, or threatening war, or
because it doesn’t buy American goods
(like Australia, it purchases from Uncle
on an immense scale and sells him very
little), or because it fails to pay its debts
to him (in what • debt repudiations there
have been Britain has been the loser). And
it certainly isn’t that British authorities
arrest the travelling Yankee upon arrival
on the plea that he is in excess of “the
quota,” or make him pay heavily for a
permit to stay on British soil for even a
brief period. And it isn’t due, either, to the
vast, indigestible mass of foreign sundries
which now fills the United States, because
it existed and was cultivated long before
the Huns, for instance, who now cheer
Mayor Thompson on his wild and whirl-
ing career, had the faintest idea that they
were going to object to the British. Empire.
It was noted and described when the an-
cestors of what is now miscalled the Ameri-
can nation were still, to a very great extent,
hustling for a humble European crust in
Russia, Poland, Italy, Germany, Scandi-
navia and 20 other countries. The only
feasible explanation which presents _ itself
is that Britain is the largest obstacle in the
way of U.S. imperialism in the two Ameri-
can continents, and in North America in
particular. Also it is the only European
obstacle. The republic has shown the same
imperial capacity for the acquisition of
territory as did the old republic of Rome.
It shifted France and Spain off the North
American map, though they were both
more extensive Powers than his own in
Uncle Sam’s early days. He bought out
Russia. Alaska looked a miserably un-
promising purchase in the pre-gold days of
1867, but when a languid Russian diplo-
matist offered it to President Johnson’s
Government the preliminary treaty was
drafted in an all-night sitting. Alaska
might seem worth only some fish and seals
and bears, but it represented empire. And
now Canada remains. When President
Monroe announced that “America is no
longer a field for European colonisation”
it may be fairly assumed that he would
gladly have given Europe notice to quit,
but 1823 was too early for that.
*/.: * * «
Canada, indeed, represents the one failure
of United States imperialism so far. It
was intended that it should be part of the
great secession in the George Washington
days, and the continental army captured
Montreal and other places, but after four
or five months the campaign went wrong.
Then it was hoped that the Dominion
would be one of the spoils of the war with
Britain in 1812-14, but this effort went
astray also. The United States army sur-
rendered near Toronto and British troops
occupied much of Ohio. Later there were
fierce disputes over the ownership of the
whole No Man’s Land between Alaska
(still Russian property then) and Cali-
fornia, and a clamor for war with the old
opponent went up, especially in the north-
ern States. But President Tyler pointed
out earnestly that to seize the disputed
property an army must either get round
Cape Horn by sea against usually adverse
winds, or else tramp across an almost track-
less continent, and that British troops from
India would forestall them either way. So
Tyler’s Administration made the best com-
promise it could manage, and the matter
was hung up once more. But it will prob-
ably turn up again. Acute Thompsonitis
is, and has always been, a purely anti-
British movement, and presumably the
Thompsons don’t work up a particular
brand of hatred with such energy unless
they want something. Golden Canada is
the only accessible British property which
is valuable enough to account for all the
effort. If it was proposed to smite the
Englishman in Australia or South Africa
or England itself, Chicago is no suitable
headquarters; but a mayor can stand on
the roof of his town hall there and almost
throw a brick into the Province of Ontario
across the border. Happily, Thompson is
not Uncle Sam.' He may be only a few
hairs of Uncle Sam's head. But he exists,
he is energetic, he has ample means and
there is material for him to work on.
Neither Britain’s friends in the U.S.A. nor
Canada can afford to disregard him and his
propaganda.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Sydney Harbor Disaster.
The collision between the liner Tahiti and
the little Watson’s Bay ferry boat Grey-
cliffe, which took so terrible a toll of human
life in Sydney harbor last Thursday, was
one of those accidents that happen in the
twinkling of an eye. At one moment the
big mail steamer and the ferry craft were
running parallel courses towards the Heads.
At the next the Greycliffe was broadside on
to the Tahiti and the keen prow of the
liner had smashed the smaller vessel into
matchwood. A formidable list of killed,
missing and injured persons testifies to the
gravity of whatever error precipitated the
disaster.
It is believed by some of those who wit-
nessed the occurrence that the ferry-boat’s
steering gear broke down, and that is, per-
haps, the theory that most of us would
like to accept. Direct evidence on the
point, however, is not likely to be avail-
able; and meantime there is not a word in
the statements made by pilot and ferry-
master to maintain this least uncomfort-
able of all possible theories.
The accident, though the most serious to
date, is not the only one of the kind that
has happened in Port Jackson—every year
produces a crop of collisions. The conclu-
sion is inescapable that the harbor is not
quite so safe and spacious as has been
boasted, and that it is time greater restric-
tion was placed upon the speed of huge
vessels when traversing its waters. The
speed of the Tahiti at the moment of im-
pact is estimated at between seven and ten
knots. Had she been travelling more
slowly the collision, whatever the cause,
might have been avoided. The matter is
one that the Harbor Trust might profitably
ponder upon. Another —if this is not a
matter for the Navigation Department—is
the design of the ferries, especially in rela-
tion to the wheel-house and the cabins.
Should the master be so boxed in as he is—
Sydney Harbor ferries other than those ot
the Manly Co. have no bridge—and should
it not be obligatory to have escape doors
leading directly seaward from all cabins?

Unfinished Works and What to Do with
Them.
The recent N.S.W. Government started so
many public works and jobs while on its
dissipated deathbed that its last complete
year’s borrowings were almost exactly
£18,000,000. In the odd three months which
followed it spent a good deal more. And
it left its works so unfinished that its suc-
cessor reckons that something like
£40,000,000 will be wanted before they are
really available. Then the State’s debt will
be £300,000,000 or so, and the bulk of the
new properties will probably fail to pay
running expenses.
It would be best if the new Government
took stock of its quarter- or half-built
undertakings to see how many of them
could with advantage be hung up for a
year or two or half a century. Then it
might find money for one or two very long
unfinished enterprises which hold out real
promise, such as the railway from Inverell
to the coast (the Clarence or Coff’s Har-
bor) and the one from Bombala to Two-
fold Bay, with a few necessary harbor
improvements thrown in. Thus it would
break the muddy and melancholy mono-
tony of centralisation and inaugurate a new
era.
To leave undertakings partly done pend-
ing the arrival of more money is common
enough. St. Mary’s Cathedral was a notable
example, and the South-to-North railway is
another. There is no reason why the new
Government should complete the works
which Lang commenced in preference to
those commenced by other people, and the
two suggested above have definite merits.
Engineer Buchanan, who was brought here
as an expert adviser, said he would ‘‘place
Clarence River first on the list of all the
ports north of Newcastle for scientific port
development for deep-sea shipping.” And
of Twofold Bay he said: “At present it is
without railway communication, but the
harbor is a good one, capable of develop-
ment at very little cost.” In addition to
supplying N.S.W. with more port accom-
modation there is a chance in this scheme
to turn a pair of incomplete and money-
losing lines (they lose about £145,000 a year)
to profitable purpose, and there would be
the satisfaction of doing something that
would be unusual without being rude or
vulgar or corrupt or wicked. This last is a
point worth considering.
*
Where Men Decay.
The drift of population towards the cities
and the consequent decay of country towns
has more bad results than meet the eye at
a first or even a second look.
One trouble is that the city is the goal
of most of the enterprising people of coun-
try towns. The country is a place to acquire
money, experience or seniority, but the city
is the Mecca of their dreams. The promis-
ing voung country surgeon, if he is in N. S.
Wales, has his eye on Macquane-street;
the bank manager of ability wants to move
on; the energetic schoolteacher, the success-
ful’storekeeper, the keen journalist all hope
to move citywards. And should their ambi-
tion flag, it is very soon revived by their
wives’ determination to be mistresses of sub-
urban villas. The brightest children of the
countryside are carefully gathered into high
schools, or sent to city boarding-schools,
and finally despatched to the University,
where they become even more confirmed
city-lovers" than their parents. Even the
successful man on the land spends more
and more of his time in the capital, and too
frequently provides a city home for his
wife and' family while his pleasant country
homestead remains deserted and forlorn
except perhaps at picnic-race time.
So there is a selective emigration city-
wards of the more virile elements of our
country population. And the worst of it i-
that these elements are not improved there-
by. Eugenically speaking, even the soundest
stocks deteriorate sooner or later in the
surroundings of city life, which is at best
highly artificial. Meanwhile the country
population suffers from stagnation, lack ot
fresh blood and consequent intermarriage
of the least enterprising people—the left-
overs. It is disquieting to find to what


extent inbreeding has already taken place
in some country districts. In the electoral
roll of one N.S.W. North Coast district
page after page is devoted to the Smiths,
all related and inter-related, followed by a
long list of Browns, closely related to one
another and to all the Smiths. In some
places where the population is stationary
one finds definite evidence of deterioration
due to inbreeding. Every country school-
teacher —to his sorrow—is familiar with
the type. Slight congenital defects are
common.
Of course this state of affairs is not uni-
versal. There is still no finer Caucasian
alive than the typical sun-tanned, clear-
eyed, country-bred Australian. But the
danger of deterioration already exists, and
if the sturdy, virile elements make for the
city to blend with its more or less C 3
population, leaving the country to be occu-
pied by an out-worn and in-bred stock,
depleted of its best qualities, the outcome is
neither hard to imagine nor pleasant to
anticipate.
The Tote in Three States.
“Silver Punter”: I believe, with The
Bulletin, that the N.S.W. Government
would get at least half a million p.a. of
tote revenue, instead of the £233,000 that
came in last year, if “straight-out” and
“place” machines were available, as in
Westralia. I go further and say that the
Hogan Government of Vic., which is about
to introduce a Totalisator Bill, will get half
a million p.a. if it adopts the Westralian
system—more, indeed, if it caters for
backers of “doubles,” as S. Africa does. The
amount of racecourse betting in Victoria
falls very little short of the N. S. Wales
total.
Victoria, of course, will need tote build-
ings and apparatus, but these need not be
elaborate in the beginning. So far from
its taking many months to furnish the
necessary facilities—a current allegation in
quarters hostile to the tote—outfits that will
do to go on with could be fitted up in a
few days. At Moorefield, a very popular
Sydney racecourse, the grandstand tote has
been housed for years in a seedy old shack.
The tickets are taken from blocks and
rubber-stamped by girls; the dividends are
chalked up on a blackboard. This arrange-
ment is primitive and inconvenient; but it
works. At a matter of fact, more money is
toted at Moorefield during the year than at
Warwick Farm or Canterbury Park, where
(at Warwick Farm particularly) there are
expensive structures and machinery—the re-
spective amounts in 1925-26 were £108,848
at Moorefield, £96,484 at Warwick Farm
and £92,469 at Canterbury Park. In the
light of this experience, the addition of a
“straightout” contrivance in Sydney would
be a simple and expeditious matter; and
“straightout” and “place” machines that
would do their job well enough could lie
installed on Vic. courses in a few days.
One important point about the steady
£55,000 p.a. which Westralia gets from its
“straightout” and “place” totes, so much
greater in proportion to the volume of
betting than the £235,000 which N.S.W 7 .
draws from its ridiculous concession-betting
implement, is that it is the product of a
lighter tax. The W T estralian Government
takes 6 p.c. of the total amount speculated
on the machines and 6 p.c. of the undistri-
buted fractions and unclaimed dividends:
the clubs get 6~i- p.c. of the total and 94
p.c. of the undistributed fractions and
dividends. In N. S. Wales the Government
tax is 9 p.c.; the clubs are allowed 3|- P-C.
and all undistributed fractions and un-
claimed dividends. Really the deductions
in both cases are too great. The tax should
no- exceed 10 p.c. all told (8i p.c. would be
sufficient in Sydney, with its vast attend-
ances), and the undistributed fractions and
unclaimed dividends should be kept for the
hospitals.
But even with the handicap of an impost
which works out at nearly 14 p.c., the
Westralian “straightout” tote holds its own
against the bookmakers. Its racecourse
competitors are few in number, and the
shopkeeping McShortodds will not pay
“tote odds for a win” without “a limit.”
The result is that people who would other-
wise hang round these unsavory shops go
to the racecourse and patronise the
machine, with benefit to the revenue from
the entertainments tax as well as the tax
on the tote. Similar consequences would
follow the establishment of “straightout”
and “place” totalisators in N. S. W T ales, only
the increase in revenue would be far
greater, for, in addition to the population
factor and others, there is a special race-
course-admissions tax in the Ma State. If
people must bet the racecourse is the
proper place for them and the totalisator
the best medium of wagering, provided the
Government gives it a fair spin.
Why Rail Freights Are High.
Dear Bulletin, —I don’t often go to
Sydney, but on a recent visit I noticed a
few things which help to add to H.C.L. and
explain why freights have to be put up.
At Burwood some alterations were being
made to a waiting-room. About 50 yards
away a quantity of sawn timber in 10- or
12-foot lengths, 4in. x 2in. pine, was stacked.
From this the men on the job were getting
pieces as they were wanted. One of these
pieces would be easily within the capacity
of a ten-year-old boy to carry. One would
therefore expect that a full-grown man
would pick up at least a couple and carry
them to the job. Nothing approaching
this was attempted. Four men sauntered
along the platform, critically examined the
heap, then carefully lifted one piece of
timber, and between them, two men at each
end, bore it to the scene of operations as
carefully as they would have done a bier
bearing the remains of Jock Garden.
A little further along the line a gang was
laying the rails which are to carry the
electric train that is being provided for the
comfort of Sydney’s population. At each
of many sleepers, Bft. 4in. in length, seven
men were pushing metal underneath with
shovels. Thus each man had a space of 14
inches to work in!
At another station a truck of bricks was
being unloaded. One man was on the truck,
and he handed one brick to another man.
who carried it across the platform and
placed it on a heap, whilst his companion
lifted another from the truck and timed the
operation to meet the leisurely return of
his mate.
Multiply these examples by the thousands
which occur every day, and some idea can
be formed of the millions which are added
to the cost of public works and to the
H.C.L.
If the Commissioners had enough force of
character to see that their employees gave
a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay the
necessity of loading higher freights on to
the man on the land would not appear so
insistent. Already they have piled nearly
100 per cent, on pre-war charges. Take
remote towns like Brewarrina and Inverell
as instances. In 1914 the rate on a truck
of fat sheep or cattle to the city was
£9 145.; now it is £l7 18s. And a further
10 p.c. rise is proposed. Can the producer
stand it?
Bavin talks of reducing freights. There
is only one possible way, and that is by
seeing that the railways get value for the
money spent in building and running them.
Under Lang’s mismanagement no one dared
say a word, as the A.R.U. was boss of the
situation. If Buttenshaw wants to make
a name for himself as Leader of the Country
party and Minister for Works he needn’t
go far to find an opportunity.—Yours, etc.

Why Tasmanians Leave Home.
In spite of improved State finances and a
brighter economic outlook, Tasmania con-
tinues to lose population to the mainland.
Figures for 1927 are not available, but last
year the loss by migration was 5354, or 2278
more than the natural increase. In the
previous year the net decrease was 807;
in five years the population has shrunk
from 218,316 to 214,754. During the same
five years there were gains of 220,000 in
N. S.‘ Wales, 161,000 in Victoria, 114,000 in
Queensland, 64,000 in South Aus. and
43,000 in Westralia.
Why do so many Tasmanians leave
home? Because the opportunities for self-
advancement are far greater in Victoria,
which is only 140 miles away at the nearest
point? That is the usual explanation, but
it does not altogether suffice. There is
no corresponding exodus from South Aus-
tralia, with its relatively small population
and limited resources, to its neighbor on
the east. Perhaps the craving for recreation
has more to do with the movement across
the strait than the craving for better jobs.
Tasmanians share the strong national taste
for organised entertainment, but they
cannot indulge it as the people of the
mainland States —particularly the one near-
est to them —do. It is a common complaint
that they “rarely see a good show,” and
the fare they get is deficient in quantity as
well as quality. The number of admis-
sions to taxable entertainments in the six
States is on record. In the latest year for
which figures are available this is how the
Speck compared with Victoria, whose popu-
lation was not quite eight times as great:—

Another Challenge to the Ldw.
“Twosides”: Four weeks ago the strike at
South Johnstone (N.Q.) was brought to an
end on the Board of Trade ordering the
men to go back to work under conditions
entirely favorable to them. The only thing
they could find fault with was that they
would have to work alongside men who had
replaced them at the time of the strike and
whom they call “scabs.” These alleged
“scabs,” some 70 in number, were unionists,
who, wanting work instead of the unem-
ployed dole, could not see anything wrong
in taking employment when the Board of
Trade had decided that the mill manage-
ment was entirely right in the dispute
which brought about the strike. They had
the courage of their convictions; many
others who wanted to take work at the
mill hesitated only because the “peaceful
picketing” got in the way. The manage-
ment promised work throughout the season
to those who were bold enough to venture
in, and that much was their due in any
case.
But what happened when the strikers
returned to work? There was constant
friction between the two bodies of men, and
the so-called “scabs,” being numerically
weaker, generally got the worst of the
argument. They suffered constant abuse,
and in fear of attack were forced to move
about in a body. Matters reached a crisis
when after a rough and tumble one of the
free laborers drew a revolver and wounded
one of the strikers. When the battle was
over three of the free laborers were arrested,
each with a revolver in his possession. As
a matter of fact, many of these men have
been carrying revolvers and insist that it
has been necessary to do so. The free
laborers have now left the mill in a body,
claiming it is impossible to stay there any
longer without the adequate protection
which is denied them.
But can these men obtain other employ-
ment, or are they going to be denied the
rights of ordinary citizenship? Although
they were unionists, the A.W.U. officials
have refused to renew their tickets, the
year’s membership having just expired.
They are now about to feel the power of
the A.W.U., and wherever they go—in
Queensland, anyway—they will be marked
men. Fellow wage-plugs will be told to
refuse to work in their company, and as
preference to unionists is compulsory in
most industries, work will be almost impos-
sible to obtain. This is what can happen to
decent, law-abiding men who, needing work,
took the place of men who had not only
broken the country’s Industrial laws, but
had openly refused to obey the instructions
of their union executive.
If this sort of thing is to be allowed to
proceed unchecked, then it is a disgrace to
the executive of the A.W.U., the Board of
Trade and the Government of Queensland.

Smith’s Tank.
A little bit of history is being written at
Smith’s Tank. When Dominions Secretary
Amery, attended by a troupe of Vic. poli-
ticians, dropped in there the other Sunday,
he was met by 70 or so settlers who have
been dumped in the place and left to
wither. A more tragic little picture has
never before been presented to travellers
wanting to see how we fill up our great
“empty spaces.” The Smith’s Tankers were
mostly grocers and navy men before some-
one in England told them there was a for-
tune to be made in the Mallee. With
£2OO apiece they packed up their baggage
and wives and families and signed on under
Victoria’s migration scheme. As soon as
they landed in Melbourne they clamored to
be allowed to get at some of the Mallee’s
wealth. Mclver, Lands Director, who appa-
rently did not fancy their chances in the
Mallee, tried to talk them over, but they
persisted; and after six weeks at Elcho
learning the right end of a cow, they per-
suaded Downward, ex-Lands Minister, to
allow them to select Mallee land which had
been turned down four years ago by men
who know the Mallee.
And there they are, living most of them
in huts made of wheat sacks and saplings.
Mclver said they might clear 200 acres in
10 months; most of them have cleared no
more than 80 acres, and they are still trying
to clear the land with the axe instead of
rolling it. They are eager enough, but
their case seems hopeless. They have no
water channels, no roads; it costs them a
shilling a packet to get groceries; it will
cost them Is. 9d. a bag to cart their wheat
over the 39 sand ridges to the railway when
they get any wheat to cart; they are each
saddled with a heavy debt, and it will be
years before they have enough land cleared
to even support themselves.
Smith’s Tank is a tragic mistake. The
men should never have been allowed to go
there without the prior preparation or
partial preparation of farms. The system
that allowed it is inhuman.

A Federal Port.
The Federal Minister for Works, replying
the other day to a question concerning a
railway from Canberra to Jervis Bay, said
that there was no truth in the statement,
alleged to have been made by a land and
estate agency, that the Government
intended to construct the line shortly. Yet
whether it was made by a land-agent or
a member of Parliament, the statement
should have been true.
Years ago, when the Commonwealth was
granted the right to a corridor to the sea,
it was understood by every far-seeing man
that by the time the Federal House met,
Canberra would be connected by rail with
its natural port. But up to the present
vested interests have proved too strong,
and Sydney even joined with Melbourne in
ignoring the fact that a harbor of any
description existed on the coast thereaoouts.
The Defence Department, however, man-
aged to secure a footing on the shores of
Jervis Bay, and the Naval College was
established, but between that school for
naval cadets and the establishment at Dun-
troon there is no connection, though the
services are supposed to work in close co-
operation.
On October 18, 1909, N. S. Wales agreed
to grant at Jervis Bay an area of two
square miles for a port, and certain other
areas, totalling 2302 acres, for defence pur-
poses. The State also granted the Com-
monwealth the right to construct, maintain
and work a railway from the Federal Ter-
ritory to the bay. The corridor, along
which there is a practicable route for a rail-
way, has a length of about 123 miles. It
presents few engineering difficulties; indeed
it is probable that a line could be con-
structed along a route which would be only
about 100 miles from city to port (the dis-
tance from the coast in a direct line is 75
miles). If it is granted that the blunder
of Canberra must stand, then the necessity
for bringing it into touch with its deep-
sea harbor cannot be argued against. The
only alternative is the construction of a
concrete road, along which fast motor trans-
port could move, and that is certainly
worthy of consideration; it is to a great
extent a matter of cost. In either event,
with the port within two or three hours by
road or rail, Canberra’s position would be
vastly improved. The bugbear of heavy
freights would be removed, and with a new
port created that corner of the State which
has for so long been handicapped by heavy
freights would come into its own, and in
the long run N. S. Wales as well as the
Commonwealth Territory would be enor-
mously the gainer.
♦-
Co-operation.
The younger Australian worker, fed upon
the idea of leaving everything to the Gov-
ernment, has a poor idea of co-operation
as a means of wiping out the middleman,
who is mentioned as a special enemy in
one part of the Labor objective. There
are a few co-operative ventures in which
workers are the main shareholders, pro-
sperous in their way; but they are small
local affairs.
The tendency towards co-operative move-
ments actually received a check when
Labor got its opportunity m the political
field. In the N.S.W. Trades and Labor
Council, then a useful body, a movement
started in 1909 met a sad end. A com-
mittee, which had E. Riley, M.H.R., as one
member and the now Nationalist Senator
Walter Duncan as another, drafted a
scheme for a progressively advancing co-
operative enterprise, proposing, in the first
place, to establish a grocery store. The
Bread Trades, which had representatives
on a general committee appointed to carry
out the scheme, demanded as the price of
support that bread should first be dealt
with, and the committee, yielding, received
from the Government (and Wade’s Gov-
ernment at that) a tentative offer of a new
building in George-street North, then un-
occupied, for a bakery. Then the Bakers’
Union, with the support of its kindred
societies, laid it down as an axiom that
hand- as opposed to machine-baking should
be the practice. After that, the commit-
tee, probably wisely, lost interest, and the
whole affair was allowed to drop.
In other countries, where dependence is
not placed upon Parliament to work eco-
nomic miracles, co-operation is a big and
growing factor. The International Co-
operative Alliance, which met in Stockholm
in August, represented 45 million co-opera-
tors in 35 countries. The alliance was
formed in 1892 in a very small way; in 1920
no less than 24 countries and 31 million
adherents were represented. The move-
ment, in view of this quick growth, pro-
mises to be an international factor of im-
portance before long.
In U.S.A., curiously, the progress has
been most marked amongst the foreign
elements of the population. The Finns
were the pioneers; although the census of
1920 showed that there were only 150,000
Finns in the country, they possess a Co-
operative Central Exchange which sells to
99 co-operative societies. Italians, Lithu-
anians, Jews and Russians have their own
separate societies—an unfortunate condi-
tion of affairs from the national point of
view, perhaps, because it retards assimila-
tion. But there is no gainsaying what co-
operation has done for its contributors.
The United Workers’ Co-operative Asso-
ciation of America is a Jewish concern and
one of the most interesting. It owned
merely a primitively equipped camp in
1923. In 1926 it built its first block
of apartment houses, consisting of two five-
storey buildings, with a large courtyard and
garden running between them. There are
altogether 964 rooms, all arranged (with
two windows in each room) to catch the
sun. divided into 339 apartments or flats,
reached by 24 entrances; and in addition
an auditorium, a library, a kindergarten
school with evening courses for adults,
and a communal music-room are pro-
vided for the use of tenants; likewise a
special playground, covered on wet days,
for children. A medical service with a
doctor in charge is included for a rent,
charged on a room basis, far below general
rentals; and the places are not the gloomy
vaults upon which the Sydney City Council
is expected to lose money. A second block
near completion had every apartment
booked before the foundations were fin-
ished, and a third block was rapidly "booked
up on its mere plans.
There is something constructive about
this co-operative movement. Labor in Aus-
tralia, having had many disappointments
in the expectation, to which it has been
educated by political windbags, that a
social reconstruction can be secured by
dividing up the property and affluence of
other people, might be advised to hark
back a few years and consider the benefits
co-operative effort can secure.

ping and demanding that the, Harbor Trust
should pay the fines. The Cairns comrades
lent a hand by refusing to unload cargo
overcarried from Bowen which the smoke-
ohs had spurned. Something will have to
be done about the Waterside Workers’ Fed-
eration. As run nowadays, it is a con-
founded nuisance to Australia. Nine-tenths
of the trouble is due to Federal organisation
of, and incessant interference with, what
should be purely district unions; so perma-
nent deregistration of the Federal organisa-
tion is suggested as a remedy.
The N.S.W. Auditor-General, in chron-
icling the 1926-27 transactions of the Lon-
don office, mentions a loan item of £523,860,
“representing purchases of materials on be-
half of the Railway Commissioners.” He
goes on to say:—
This does, not by any means represent the total
value of goods imported bv the Railway Department
from England and America, as in numerous in-
stances payment for purchases from these countries
is made to the local agents in Sydney.
So much for Slang’s promise of “absolute
preference” to N.S.W. manufacturers.
For once the Bruce-Pag e Government has
refused a Royal Commission. Coleman,
M.H.R., asked for one to inquire about wild-
cat life-insurance companies, but the Attorney-
General said it was needless, as he is inquir-
ing himself. The Lord only knows what
the good man is inquiring about. If there
are no cats a law is needed to prevent
them. If there are cats a law is needed to
eliminate them. And if the Attorney-
The Canberra Parliament broke off for
the week-end in the midst of a dense crop
of speeches from members who demanded a
Federal railway from Broome, Northern
Westralia, right across the continent, and
others who clamored for an immediate Fed-
eral line through West Queensland to Dar-
win or thereabouts. One of the latter gave
his personal assurance that his job “would
become immediately productive,” but offered
no deposit. By way of a bright spot, the
Prime Minister announced at long last that
the Commonwealth Shipping Line is to be
sold, and that in future the House would
sit on Tuesdays and try to do some work.
So Canberra will be inhabited one extra day
per week.
Lithgow, Australia’s second-largest coal-
field, has just had a “Six Hour Day” smoke-
oli, at which D. J. Davies, the miners’ general
secretary, said that there were about 8000
more men in the industry than it could sup-
port and that “the biggest upheaval” m
history was coming—presumably to win the
six-hour day, and thus make the work
“go round.” On the same principle, if there
are twice too many pubs in Lithgow none of
them should be closed —the size of the beer-
glass should be reduced by one-half to make
the thirst “go round.”
Vic. Parliament has been slightly more
than four months in session. Little has been
achieved, although there has been no Oppo-
sition obstruction; with one or two excep-
tions, the bills passed have been odds and
ends. As usual, the Houses will have to
speed up if they are to finish before Christ-
mas. Hogan might just as well crack Ins
whip now as in the second week of Decem-
ber. A new House, led by a new Govern-
ment, ought to give stronger evidence of
energy.
The latest waterside strike at Bowen (Q.)
there is one every month or two- —broke
out because some members of the union had
been fined for smoking on the jetty wharf.
Smoking is banned on wharves and in . cargo
sheds in every port in the world, but that did
not prevent “solidarity” hanging up the ship-
SAD FINISH OF THE GOLDEN-EGG INDUSTRY.
“’Struth, Bill, I b’lieve you’ve killed it!”
General doesn’t know that there are cats he
ought to know. Australia got its uniform
bankruptcy law in 1924, yet the thing isn t
working yet. When the pace is so slow an
early start is advisable so that there jnay be
a chance to arrive before dark.
After throwing an eye or two arouhd Can-
berra, Dominions-Secretary Amery said it
was “destined to become a great city.” But
that isn’t necessarily anything to be cheerful
about. If it is to continue to be merely a
parasite city, the smaller it is the better.
In his conservative way Opposition-leader
Charlton is morosely hostile to the abolition
of the freak law which requires the signing of
political articles when a Federal election
or by-election is on. If the idea had any
merit it should apply to all election times,
and to all other times, it being at other times
that most things are said. But the thing has
no merit. Sometimes the wrong man signs,
and sometimes a group of signatories "take
the responsibility” in a heap. And once the
regulation did some slight damage to a per-
son who professed that he wrote the whole
paper.
The Ma State’s new Government has sus-
pended the operation of the child-endowment
tax —3 p.c. on the amount of wages and
salaries paid—from Oct. 31 to June 30. The
step was warranted by the fact that Slang’s
insane impost on industry was causing serious
unemployment, but if Bavin proposes to let
child endowment go on he will need a lot
of revenue from other sources. He could get
the bulk of it by taxing amusements where the
charge is less than 2s. 6d., by insisting on
the installation of “straiglitout” and “place ’
totes on registered racecourses, and by making
licensed bookmakers pay 1 p.c. on their turn-
over. Sydney s.-p. bookmakers allow their
agents 2s. in the £. A licensed man fielding
on the Melbourne Cup returned his clients 10
p.c. of the amounts they staked. So a 1 p.c.
tax on turnover could be easily borne. At
present the brotherhood pays the Government
a mere £40,000 p.a. .in stamp duties and the
like, so it is ridiculously undertaxed.
For the first quarter of the financial year
Australia’s imports of merchandise exceeded
exports by 15f million pounds.' If the pace
continues throughout the year this item and
the interest bill will add about £100,000,000
to the external debt during With
so many foreign wares coming in to take
the place of home-made goods employment is
naturally scarce, but Bruce-Pago neither
produces nor suggests a remedy. The unruffled
double skipper has ideas on almost every
subject except how to keep the ship off the
rocks.
Mr. Buttonhole, N.S.W. Minister for Rail-
ways, has stated that “the Government s
policy at present is to proceed only with those
public works already in hand.” In other
words, it proposes, to let its public works
policy be dictated by Lang. When it has fin-
ished his jobs Lang may possibly be due to
come back because his successors have lacked
originality, and to lay out another programme
for the Nat.-Cockies to finish in turn. The
theory is that any old job, however ill-judged,
must be carried to a conclusion in order to
extract revenue from it and prevent the
money already spent being wasted. But
N.S.W. lias plenty of railways and other
things on which it would have been cheaper
to suspend work, so the rule has exceptions.
As evidence of the little interest taken in
the municipal affairs of Melbourne, the re-
tiring councillors for the eight wards of
the City Council were re-elected unopposed.
A Greater Melbourne Bill was promised in
the Governor's speech in July, but nobody
now expects it to be passed this session. If
the draft measure is published that will be
as much as the public will get this year.
So intense is the anxiety of the majority
at Sydney Town Haul to prevent the plac-
ing of Sydney under the rule of paid com-
missioners that it wants the Secretary of
State for the Dominions, who is visiting
these parts, to interfere. The thing is de-
nounced as an outrage on the principle of
self-government. But the Bavin Ministry’s
commissioners will be- the creation of the
adult-suffrage Parliament of self-governing
N.S.W. Further, they are only to hold office
till there is time to glance into past doings
and till a self-governing Greater Sydney can
be organised, and the Labor majority is
understood to pant for a Greater Sydney.
Though the Maoriland railways are not
paying interest on their capital cost,
£2,301,030 more was invested in them last
year as against £1,055,014 the previous year.
The heavy railway expenditure is partly due
to the recommendations of the English ex-
perts Fay and Raven, who wanted to com-
plete the M.L. system, at present a thing
of shreds and patches. One of their pro-
posals was to link the two islands with a
railway-ferry, carrying trains, but that would
involve building a South Island railway from
Nelson or Blenheim to Christchurch, and it
has therefore been dropped. So the Union
Co. continues to carry all the traffic between
the North Island and the South, and most
of the traffic between the northern pro-
vinces of the South Island and their neigh-
bors further south.
“Sol Malaprop” : For the first time in my
life I regret not being a Sydney alderman of
the Labor brand. Knowing that the Premier's
minions would find out nothing detrimental
to me and my cobbers I would be pleased to
see him reveal his basely suspicious character,
and thereby fall to his proper level, and I
would enjoy his baffled rage and, I hope, liis
humiliating exit from office. If the public vin-
dication of my honor and ability didn’t secure
me the Agency-General or something equally
good I would at least become an alderman of
the new Greater Sydney, and I would make a
devil of a row about payment for my ser-
vices. Some people can’t recognise the chance
to damage an enemy when they see it.
The reduced hours and other benefits
which Bruce’s arbitration courts hand out
with the irresponsibility of children are hav-
ing such an effect on State railway systems
which were already on the financial rocks
that the dashing Prime Minister may be told
before long to take the worst ones over and
find the money to pay the deficits himself.
The South Aus. railways have practically
ceased to pay anything towards interest, and
the blame is laid almost wholly on Federal
Arbitration Court doings. The presentation
of the bill in some shape or form to the
Federal boss seems highly probable.
It’s only in an exceptionally good season
that Maoriland grows enough wheat to keep
the bread-bin stocked, but duties on wheat
and flour have been played with for years.
The latest invention is a sliding scale duty.
Wheat valued at ss. fid. a bushel at port of
shipment pays duty at the rate of Is. 3d. a
bushel. For every id. above ss. Gd. the duty
comes down id.; for every id. below ss. 6d.
it goes up id., the intention being to secure
the M.L. cocky a return of not less than
6s. 9d. a bushel. The main for flour is fixed at
£l3 10s. a ton at port of export, with a
duty of £3 10s. a ton and shilling rises or
decreases to ensure that locally grown flour
at £l7 a ton shall not be undersold. The next
thing will be a roar from the North Island,
which grows hardly any wheat, and which
provides the Government with most of its
supporters. Then, as in other years, the
duty will be reduced or modified or just
quietly spifflicated.
The old John Chinaman, with his bow
and arrows or his matchlock, ran his civil
commotions with Tittle damage in battle,
though the massacre might be considerable.
The new breech-loading and machine-gun
John appears to be a killer in battle as well
as in brigandage. As a result, famines are
raging in various provinces, the troops hav-
ing taken most of the local food supply for
rations and destroyed the rest. The old
aristocracy has lost its hold. It was an
aristocracy of learning—not useful scientific
learning, but quaint classical erudition; and
the men who had passed many examinations
had a lien on the posts of honor. Now
it is related that a gentleman of tli e old
school, being roped in as baggage-carrier
for the troops -of some warlord, pro-
tested that he was a scholar, and was told,
in true Bolshevik strain, that when he was
worn out carrying baggage and of no further
use to the army he would still be a scholar.

From all carriages the thirsty horde dropped
hastily and made for the lone pub. Suddenly
there was a gasp of horror —a woman had
joined the procession, carrying a bottle
brazenly under her arm. The onlookers
talked in hushed tones of the harrowing
spectacle; one elderly lady opined that the
hussy should be spoken to about it. Then
the whistle sounded and the line of refreshed
travellers began to trail back to the station.
There was no sign of the woman, and several
of her sex severely observed that if she
missed the train it would just serve her
right. The engine breathed stertorously and
began to glide slowly out. Just then there
was a commotion at the hotel door; the
proprietor appeared waving liis arms and
shouting, his wife seconded his efforts in
a shrill treble, and then suddenly out ran
the belated customer. She shrieked louder
than anyone, and emphasised her appeal by
waving aloft an infant’s feeding-bottle filled
with milk. The whole train sized up the
situation instantly and the yell of sympathy
caused the driver to pull up with a fierce
jerk. A dozen men rushed to assist the
little mother aboard, and amid frantic cheers
the train resumed its progress.

could have been identified by his surname.
About a week before the Landing Bilson
paraded and asked me, if he was outed, to

Bart., his father. I suggested that it was
a very opportune time to make it up with
the old man, but he said he didn’t give a
fig for the guv’nor, but as he was the heir
it was only a fair thing that they should
know if he went out. Eventually I per-
suaded him to write to the family solicitors.
Then there was Rockmellon, the C.O.’s bat-
man. One day in France when the bat-
talion was in reserve we received a visit
from a monocled major of the Guards. As
he was leaving Rocky slouched past, and the
Guardie opened his face so wide that the
window dropped out. “Horace ! By Gad !”
he exclaimed, and dashed forward to greet
his brother.

“Momokeni” : The aged champagne which
sent the six Diggers into hospital (B.
20/10/’27) was probably not grape wine at
all, but some of the “near” champagne manu-
factured by the Marne vignerons from rhu-
barb, largely grown in Yorkshire and shipped
from Hull to the Seine ports. Most of the
sweet champagne so beloved of chorus ladies
contains a high percentage of this rhubarb
wine, which is rich in oxalic acid at any
time and liable to grow richer with age.

“W.1.U.”: The shades of dead and gone
battlers of the Far West (N.S.W.) would

tor alists’ Association of West
Darling the other morning
between the clerk and a cook
in search of a job. The men in-
sist on having someone who will
get them afternoon tea on Satur-

“Right oh,” said the cook as he
closed on the offer, and the only
one who laughed was a nug-
gety typist sitting at her
machine. Morning and after-
noon tea are provided for
station-workers and shearers
out back as a matter of course
on full-working days; but this
was a little extra.
“W.1.U.”: The through line Sydney to
Broken Hill has just been opened, and
already Broken Hill is beginning to wonder
whether it was worth while. With a popu-
lation that does most of its travelling in
motor-cars —there is one car to every five
persons in Broken Hill —passenger traffic of
the better-off will be negligible, and the
lower-wage worker and his family on holi-
day must take into account the higher fare
to Sydney and the meal charges—3s. for
breakfast, same for lunch and ss. for dinner
runs into money for even a small family.
A 25-hour journey with no second-class
sleeper has no attraction for dad and even
less for mum, especially when the destination
is reached after nine at night. Adelaide is only
14 hours away by train, the travelling being
done at night, so that a hamper is all that
is required for the youngsters, while dad and
mum can get all they want' from refresh-
ment-rooms on the route. The train reaches
Adelaide in time to allow everyone to settle
down in his holiday quarters before lunch.
That makes it look as if S.A. is going to
retain the bulk of the Broken Hill holiday
traffic.

“Mudros”: I have vivid memories of
some “Darktown” fire-brigades (B.
27/10/’27) in France. We arrived at Pou-
lainville, near Amiens, at dusk in April, ’IS,
and two hours later a fire broke out in the
estaminet. The village organisation arrived at
the double, but failed to get a squirt out of
the ancient manual. When they gave it up the
Diggers took charge; a bucket-line was
established from the pond to the fire and
the hose was soon playing on the roof of
the doomed drinkery. There were wild
rumors of spies about, and when, later that
night, the transport-officer caught a man
flashing a torch among the debris, he covered
liim with his revolver and ran him up to
the house of the Mayor. There he found
that he had arrested the captain of the fire-
brigade, who had been searching diligently
for the mislaid key of his station house !

“Sebrof”: Lord Raglan (B. 27/10/’27)
was not the last soldier before Earl Ilaig
to be commemorated in a pub sign. There is
a Baden Powell Hotel in Collingwood, and
Fitzroy possesses a tavern named after Gen-
eral Gordon.

“Veega”: There are more military com-
manders of the last 50 years commemorated
on pub signs than “Oxmead” (B. 27/10/’27)
is aware of. At Great Yarmouth there are
hotels respectively named the Sir Garnet
Wolseley, Earl Roberts and Lord Kitchener.
Nottingham has or had a Gatacre Arms and
Crowborough (Sussex) a Warren Inn.

“P.M.”: Anzac Day wasn’t always a
public holiday. On April 25, 1919, the staff
at Horseferry-road were given three hours
off to see the procession. There were ISO
men in our department, but only five came
back at two o’clock. Next day 175 delinquents
were lined up outside the office. The first
man marched in tendered the following ex-
planation : “I had a couple of drinks after
the procession, and as I’ve been gassed, sir,
it went to my head, so I went and had a
sleep.” When"the next six men had repeated
the pre-arranged formula, word for word,
the officer in charge put on his cap and
made for the door. “You’re a lot of drunken
liars,” he roared. “Parade —dismiss !”

To bellow in my ear, “That for a tale !
No horse could do it, as you darned well
know;
Back home with you, me lad, back home, to
gaol!”
And back I go.

“Merris”; Sir Galahad made his appear-
ance in the Adelaide Criminal Court the
other day. The damsel in distress had been
charged with infanticide and found guilty
of manslaughter, but before sentence could
be pronounced up jumped Sir G. with a
chivalrous offer of marriage if ’Sonali would
let the lady off. After prolonged cogitation
the Judge displayed some of the reputed
wisdom of Solomon, and the couple left
arm-in-arm.

“Runa”: When it was found that the
M.L. barmaid system (B. 3/11/’27), like the
Scottish peerage, provided for no new
licenses, the value of a permit to decorate
the background of a bar began to go up.
When the authorities awakened to the fact
that, though several barmaids had per-
manently left the professional ranks, there
was no diminution in the number of
licenses in use, they made some cautious
investigations and discovered that there was
a brisk little trade in licenses, each retiring
maid having the chance of handing hers on to
an aspirant at a substantial profit. The
buyer, of course, had to assume the name
of the original licensee, but many of them
found this no deterrent. The last barmaid
will some day be as interesting as the last of
the Morioris.

“P.M.”: Re the passing of the lamp-
lighter (B. 20/10/’27). I know a small
town in Northern Yic. which just recently
switched the electric light on. One of the
residents is an ancient who has put in half a
lifetime doing the sanitary round in the
morning and attending to the lamps in the
afternoon. For a couple of months now he
has spent his afternoons leaning against a
disused lamp-post; he looks as if lie were
speculating on how long it will be before
enough new houses are built to make his
sanitary round a full-time job. I wouldn’t
like to see the town sewered. I think the
shock would kill old Tom.

“Verri”: South Africa is not the only
country suffering from the flag complex. At
Wellington (M.L.) a Chinese sports meet-
ing is held on October 10 to celebrate the
birth of the republic. The ordinarily placid
atmosphere of the gathering was disturbed
this year by members of the revolutionary
party, who demanded that the national flag
should be scrapped and the emblem of the
rebels flown. In the midst of the commotion
that followed the Chinese Consul cabled to
Pekin for instructions, and was sternly com-
manded to stop the revolutionary flag from
being waved aloft. Thereupon those in
favor of Kuomintang rule decided to with-
draw and hold a snorts meeting of their
own. The local police were detailed to
keep a watchful eye on both gatherings.
* * * *
“Mudurup”: Don’t remember how the
news of King Edward’s demise reached me,
but I retain a vivid recollection of a scorch-
ing day in January, 1901, when my mates
and I were working a show on the out-
skirts of Kalgoorlie. Some tradesman’s cart
had rattled up and the occupant stopped to
survey our operations or as much of them
as was visible. “Heard the news?” he
asked casually. We disclaimed having heard
anything worthy of that term for quite a
while. “The Queen’s dead,” he told us
importantly and passed on. Whether old
Dan heard him imperfectly, or was rendered
illogical by physical discomfort, I have never
quite decided, but he leaned his pick against
the side of the trench and mopped his brow
with a resigned gesture. “I don’t wonder at
it either,” he grumbled; “this blanky
weather’d kill any woman !”
* * * *
“Kerys”; A well-known firm of manufac-
turing tobacconists, who encourage the con-
sumption of their cigarettes by awarding
prizes for pictorial proof of the number sold,
the other day received a bundle of picture-
cards from the country, held together by a
frayed band of black elastic. There was a
covering letter giving details of the packet,
but it was the last item that particularly
intrigued the recipients. It ran: “P.S. —
Please return Mary’s garter.”
“Hamer”: A long argument has been
dragging along in a Sydney daily over the
origin of “The Hole in the Wall,” the name
pertaining to an old-time and long-vanished
pub in Paddington. The obvious explana-
tion, that a pub might be given a name like
that because its entrance tens a hole in the
wall, seems to have been ignored by almost
all the controversialists, but several British
taverns have acquired the label for no other
reason. Besides the Paddington pub there
were two places in Sydney that bore the same
homely designation. One was the cellar bar,
opening into Wynyard-lane, of a hotel which
had its real frontage in Wynyard-square.
Here was a sawdusted room where beer was
served from casks picturesquely ranged
round the wall; the passing of the subter-
ranean tap was a severe blow to artists and
local Bohemians generally. The other Hole
in the Wall was a “half-and-half” and pie
joint in Castlereagli-street, which got its
name because it was reached through an
opening in a wall-like hoarding. Later it
moved to brick and mortar surroundings,
and continued to do a brisk trade until the
war removed most of its patrons. There
were more Bohemian regrets when the
shutters went up.

“Pip Tok” : The licensee of a big hotel in
an Australian capital is also part owner of
another city pub and full owner of a coffee
palace. Some time back, his nerves not being
able to keep up to the strain of money-spin-
ning, his doctor prescribed a complete rest and
change of scene for at least three months.
He took a trip to Maoriland, but after roam-
ing around for a few weeks he became fed
up with idleness and spent the remainder
of his holiday working for wages as a bar-
man.
“Borom” : The unceremonious duel which
rid Melbourne of a couple of undesirables
in Taylor and Cutmore (B. 3/11/’27) will pro-
bably be found to have been a revival of the
vendetta between rival Fitzroy gangs of some
years back. Leslie or “Squizzy Taylor was
a product of one of the worst of Melbourne’s
slums; he began his criminal career as one
of the pickpockets infesting the Bourke-
street theatres and picture-shows; in 1916
he had progressed sufficiently to be tried for
the murder of a chauffeur. He was acquitted,
but he was a marked man from then on-
wards. The Fitzroy vendetta, according to
WAITING ON THE MAT.
“According to Senator Pearce, the failure of migration is solely due to the States refusing to take
immigrants after Australia House has arranged for adequate supplies ‘of suitable people.”
The Man on the Mat: “I met the manager, who told me we could get accommoda-
tion here.”
The Waiter at the Window: “Well, you can’t. Me and my mates is ’avin’ a little
party, an’ we ain’t got the rooms tidied up yet.”
some, originated over the theft of certain
diamonds belonging to Taylor’s current mis-
tress; others attributed it to a squabble over
the division of the loot from the robbery of
a city jeweller’s shop. Its worst result
was to secure Taylor a lot of publicity from
sensation-hunting newspapers. The cheap
stuff went to his head and caused him to
imagine that he really was a sort of Claude
Duval or Ned Kelly of the city alleys.
Probably the few big jobs in which he par-
ticipated were the work of criminals of a
much shrewder and more retiring type
well pleased to remain in the background.
Of late years “Squizzy” had come under
suspicion of being a “stool pigeon,” in the
American phrase; or “fizgig,” as the in-
former is known locally.

“Lao-dah”: A Melbourne City Council
employee, William Cornelius, specialises in
stopping bolts. At any rate, he always seems
to be around when a team of draughts towing
a mountain of merchandise run amok through
the streets. He has just stopped his 25tli
lot of runaways. Ilis method is always the
same. lie climbs aboard over the poop and
works his way for’ard until he can get a
grip of the reins.

“N’lmporte”: The scene of the Supreme
Court’s activities in North Queensland was
recently shifted from tnnisfail to Cairns
owing to the almost insuperable difficulty
of getting juries at the. former town to
convict anybody of anything. . But Crown
prosecutors are having little, if any, better
luck further south. In the first nine
criminal cases subsequently heard at Cairns
there were no convictions; and at the last
sittings the only three trials on the list —
for murder, liorse-stealing and attempted
arson —terminated similarly, though in at
least two of the cases the judicial summing
up could hardly have been more adverse to
the accused. The arson job, by whomsoever
perpetrated, showed the most careful pre-
meditation. There was a contrivance com-
prising three Columbia dry cells connected
with coil and sparking-plug; the last was
in a small dish of petrol with an outlet
hole to prevent the spirits from getting high
enough to drown the spark. The whole was
connected with the alarm hammer of a
clock, and but for the timepiece having run
down the lire would doubtless have trans-
pired according to schedule, for an oil-soaked
quilt led from the plug to a half-tub of
petrol.
“Skyrider”: Dawkins was very near the
rocks; he could just manage the price of a
decent room and his raiment was still pass-
able, but the food problem almost had him
beat. One morning early, as he was wander-
ing along a Sydney suburb, wondering where
•breakfast was coming from, the sight of a
milkman driving away from a house pro-
vided a solution. Dawkins walked around to
the back and laid larcenous hands on a
brimming quart jug; when he put it down
the jug contained only a pint. Presently a
baker left two loaves, one brown arid the
other white, on the doorstep of another
slumbering household, and this completed
the moral downfall of Dawkins. Remember-
ing the advice of the modern doctor, he took
the brown loaf. Before next morning he
had secured a small can and evolved a
system, and for a month he lived on bread
and milk. “I never took the lot,” he ex-
plained to “but I always got at least
a pint of milk and one loaf of bread. I
got so fond of brown bread that sometimes
I had to call at several places before I got
what I wanted. And when I got a job I
found that I could live better on brown
bread and milk than on other tucker.”
“Lao-dah” : “Squizzy” Taylor was a born
actor. When Murray was standing his trial
for murder, the professional poseur used to
draw up daily outside the exercise-yard of
the old Melbourne Gaol in Victoria-street.
The walls were then of immense height, and
there wasn’t a chance of escape for the pri-
soner, but the rumor got round that Squizzy
was engaged in a heroic attempt at rescue.
He never denied it.
“Murkah”: I can sympathise with the
Prahrau lady whose abo. handmaiden from
the N.T. developed leprosy (B. 27/10/’27).
Years ago, while stationed at Cooktown, I
paid a visit to a cattle-run about 100 miles
north and remained there three weeks. The
cook was a Chinese-abo. half-caste. About
four months later a doctor asked me to come
and photograph a leper who was tied up in
the yard of the Cooktown police-station
awaiting transport to the lazarette. When
I saw him my heart missed a few beats—it
was tlic cook. The doctor gave me some re-
assuring literature on the subject, princi-
pally the report of a Royal Commission in
India, which set forth that so non-contagious
is the disease that segregation is really a
needless precaution; nevertheless, it was
months before my feeling of dread wore
away. Father Damien, who lived with the
lepers on Molokai, Hawaiian Islands, con-
tracted the disease himself, though not till
14 years had passed.
* * * *
“W.1.1L” : If unsaleable freehold land is a
sign of decay, quite a number of Australian
mining towns must be hard up against it.
The Barrier Miner recently published the
following letter: “I have a freehold block
of land in the municipality of Broken Hill.
1 advertised it to be given away free of
cost, but I could not give it away. As rates
and taxes are heaping up on it, do you know
of any way I could free myself of that
block?” The question was referred to the
town clerk, and that authority pointed out
that there was no way a freeholder could
release himself from his obligations except
by the transfer of his property. But if
nobody will have it at a gift, transfer isn’t
as easy as it sounds.

“Erua” : The rare murex shell, from which
the lost purple dye of Tyre is supposed io
have been obtained, is found at Russell,
in the Bay of Islands, M.L. On one of the
small islets near the township, known as
Murex Island, many of the beautiful little
shells are cast up ; in these waters they are
not drab but colored a wonderful pink. Many
of the residents have them set in brooches
or earrings, and a “murex picnic” is quite
an institution. A launchful of searchers are
landed on the island and make a lynx-eyed
patrol of the beaches. But they often return
empty-handed, for the shells seem to come up
only with certain tides.
* >;: *
“Verri”: Talking of unscheduled train
stops, a few years ago North Auckland had an
amazing mushroom season, of which the
drivers of goods-trains proceeded to take
immediate advantage. The engine would be
stopped in some spot, remote from the gaze
of authority, while the train staff, with
knives and baskets, would scour the adjacent
paddocks, and soon glean a harvest sufficient
to keep the family in ketchup for the next
year. Incidentally, the Yorks’ train was
pulled up on one trip at the beginning of this
year to enable the distinguished visitors to
alight and gather the huge blackberries that
were growing thick beside the railway line.
if * * *
“X.N.0.” : America, no doubt, treated the
Commonwealth Band badly (B. 20/10/’27) ;
nevertheless, if a collection of instrument-
alists from Uncle Sam’s country came here
and sought to mop up £20,000 worth of con-
tracts which local musicians wanted for them-
selves, I wonder if the visitors would be
treated any better. In any case I have a
very clear recollection of considerable oppo-
sition by the Australian Musicians’ Union
to the band of the Royal Marine Light
Infantry playing in Melbourne and Sydney
when it visited this country with the Prince
of Wales in 1920.

“Carisbrook, Jun.”: The old Palmer
(N.Q.) line, running from Cooktown to the
Laura, rumbles to the clank of what must
surely be the most venerable working loco,
in Australia (B. 20/10/’27). When the line
was- first opened in ’79 “Battling Annie”
was a second-hand loco., but she still main-
tains a bi-weekly service. Like all old-time
Palmer pioneers she scorns new-fangled
ideas, and still sticks to the old kauri- and
gum-log for her bunker. During the whole
of her service the boiler and tubes have
never been renewed, although last year the
boiler-inspector shook his head doubtfully as
lie eyed the ancient piece of machinery,
oozing steam or smoke from every joint.
* * * *
“X2X”: Persistence can hardly be car-
ried too far when attempts are being made
to resuscitate tlic apparently drowned. At
Canberra recently a girl was successfully
brought round after having been submerged
in the' Molongo River for. 10 minutes.
Entanglement in a piece of wire kept her
under water. I can recall, at Crcnulla
(N.S.W.), a woman being revived by ordin-
ary artificial respiration, plus an electric
battery and hypodermic injections of strych-
nine and digitalin, after her body had been
in the sea for nearly an hour. There ns
a case on record at Adelaide of a 14-year-old
boy being restored to life after an immersion
of more than an hour in the river and after
one doctor had certified him to be dead. On
the other hand, it is frequently impossible
to revive apparently-drowned persons who
have been in the water for only a few
minutes. Generally speaking, it requires a
much shorter immersion in fresh water than
in salt to cause death; the explanation is
perhaps to be found in the different specific
densities.
* * * *
“Mako” : It is extremely likely that when
(or if) imported nightingales begin to sing
in Maoriland (B. 3/11/’27) their notes will
be found uncommonly like those of the native
tui. When some years ago a nightingale
record, specially made for the owner during
a stay near a Surrey wood, was turned
on for an expectant Auckland audience, the
listeners were unanimous in their verdict
that it might have been a tui in one of his
most melodious moods. The tui, of course,
having the ability to mock almost anything,
could, on acquaintance, imitate a nightingale
with the same facility as he shows when pro-
ducing the cry of a child or the meow of
the family cat.

“Zabut”: Smithers allows nobody to for-
get that he owned the first motor-car ever
seen in the district. He hangs on like grim
death to his original number-plate, and
though he has had many cars since the first,
his latest purchase still boars the two trea-
sured numerals. Just outside the town therb’s
a fairly stiff hill; here recently a number
of sportive youths spent the afternoon bet-
ting on the poker hands made by the passing
cars. The language of the luckless gambler
who was relying on Smitliers’s car for two
pairs or thereabouts sadly shocked tlm
inmates of a conveyance which passed a
second or two later.
THE CHINESE PROBLEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Troops are being rushed north to the assistance
of Feng Yu-hsiang, who is attacked by Manchu forces
under Chang-Tso-Lin.”
“Reverses have been suffered by Yen-Hi-Shan,
who is engaging Sun-Chuan-Fang.”
“General Chang-Hsuenh-Liang is pressing the
Shansi army.” —Various cables.
Time was when a Chink of the martial kind,
Planning campaigns or a warlike stroke,
Was rated as merely a humorous find;
But this bunch of names gets beyond a
joke.
He can’t keep track, the average bloke,
With this list of heroes of siege and fray;
They’re alphabetical, bellicose folk,
Who chase one another about Cathay.
And if Chang-Tso-Lin or Yen-Hsi-Shan
Leaps into fame with some startling feat,
It cuts no ice with the casual man
Who is tailed with the affix “in-tlie-street.”
His knowledge of Chinese is incomplete,
And the titles of each slant-eyed grandee,
Each . Mongol Hannibal, leave him beat,
Like the symbols seen on a chest of tea.
So here’s a notion to settle the doubt
And stop all arguments, pro and con.
Why waste time sorting Cliow generals out?
Let’s just re-christen the whole lot “John.”

“Gregor”: The assertion of Alexander
Stein, former chief officer of the German
raider Wolf, that in May, 1917, he flew
over Sydney in one of the Wolf’s ’planes has
had much ridicule poured on it in one
of the Sydney dailies. Nevertheless
there is something to support the claim
in the records of the Aviation School at
Richmond (N.S.W.). In May, 1917, the
presence of a strange ’plane over Sydney was
reported, and as it was believed that there
was an enemy raider in the Pacific, the
chief pilot at the Richmond School. Captain
APPREHENSIVE.
LADY: “I’ve broken my glasses. Have Ito be examined all over again?”
“No, only just your eyes.”
W. .T. Stutt, set out to investigate. Stutt,
who afterwards lost his life while searching
for an overdue ship in Bass Strait, flew a
considerable distance up and down the coast
and inspected a number of vessels, but he
failed to sight the Wolf. The chances are
that the vessel was either concealed in some
bay or had already put out to sea. The date
on which Stutt made his flight was a day
or two after that on which Captain Nerger,
the commander of the Wolf, states in his
book that a ’plane was sent up and that it
flew over Sydney. If such a flight was
made, however, it is difficult to credit that
its object was to drop bombs on the city,
for such action would have revealed that
the Wolf was not far away, and would have
set dozens of ships searching for her in a
few hours.

“Clerk” : Touching this refunding of con-
science money, Vic. railway chief Clapp re-
cently received postal-notes to the value of
fl 55., accompanied by the following artless
communication:—
About five years ago I went to a place about 300
miles from Melbourne, seeking an opening to make
a living, but failed to get one and returned. I
travelled second class, and I fear my luggage (clothes
and bag of implements) was overweight—perhaps
20 to 30 lb. I never weighed it, so I don’t know.
Still, the thought that I may have done the rail-
ways down lias troubled me, so I enclose 255.,
which should be enough to pay carriage on the double
journey and compound interest.
Officially, seven bob is considered the maxi-
mum amount for which the honest one could
have been socked. But Clapp can do with
the extra money.

“Seaplane” : Last Saturday afternoon out-
side Liverpool (N.S.W.) my car was bailed
up by two gipsy women anxious to turn
their professional talents to account. I was
familiar with most of the programme. After
the patter about journeys to come and pro-
sperity waiting in the distance, and the
crossing of their palms with silver, I
admit to being a bit staggered when, at the
end of the seance, the prophetesses climbed
into a well-kept Dodge car parked by the
roadside and were whirled away. Shade of

“Mars” : Some years ago the residents of
southern Yorke Peninsula (S.A.) were
puzzled by the appearance of a will-o’-the-
wisp light iff the scrub country south of
Warooka. Some credited it to supernatural
causes, others gave it a scientific explanation,
but the origin of the light remained a mystery
until one day the schoolmaster let the cat out
of the bag. He had friends on a farm some
miles distant, and was accustomed to visit
them two evenings a week. Riding a horse,
he took a short cut through the bush, and
for safety’s sake had a lantern fixed to one
of his stirrups.

“Casual Burglar’s Laborer”: A Sydney
magistrate expressed surprise the other day
—I don’t know why—when a “vag” w T ith a
long list of convictions, given his choice
between a term in Long Bay gaol and a
period in the old men’s home at Lidcombe,
expressed an unhesitating preference for the
former. There is little difference in the
treatment, except that the food at Long Bay
is a bit fetter —especially if a competent
cook happens to have been sentenced for a
term —than it is at Lidcombe. And the
last prejudice against the former place, as
far as the hardened guest is concerned,
vanished when, instead of a prisoner having
to serve a good-conduct month before he was
entitled to a ration of tobacco, the weed
became available right away. Vags seldom

give much trouble; forced to do something
resembling work, they earn money, and when
they come out they have a few bob to rattle
in their pockets. As one of them confided
to me: “I’ve been out for six weeks, an’
its erbout time I went back again. I could
do with an ’ot bath, an’ me boots is almost
off nve feet. When I come out after me
bit of a noliday, the Governor’ll ’and me
out a pair of boots and some clothes, maybe,
and with some loose silver I’ll be right as
rain.” There are, of course, vagrants who,
never having been “in.,” retain a horror of
gaol and prefer Lidcombe; but they are in
the minority.
“Count Drolatique”: On
undertaking some belated
repairs to his kitchen the
other day a very respectable
St. Kilda householder dis-
covered a mysterious cavity
in the wall which had been
adeptly concealed from view
by a thin wooden board cov-
ered with wallpaper. The
house-father thought no more
of the vacancy except to re-
mark to his wife that it
would make an excellent
hiding-place. He is now
thinking harder about the
matter, however, since he
learnt that a previous tenant
was the late “Squizzy” Tay-
lor. The departed gunman
had a partiality for Mel-
bourne’s seaside suburb. In
a villa occupied by him in
the same locality Alan Mur-
ray was arrested, to go sub-
sequently to the drop amid
the laments of a hysterical
mob outside the Melbourne
Gaol.

“Mullarula”: The argument in Mrs.
Hogan’s bar had become heated, and the
lady of the house was obviously apprehen-
sive that a fight might start at any moment.
At this stage the yardman, hitherto regarded
by all patrons of the establishment as a
man of peace, rushed in. “What’s all this
talk?” he roared. “Is there anyone here that
feels like a fight?” and he rolled his shirt
sleeves meaningly as he spoke. “Yes.”
roared back a big navvy, “I do.” The yard-
man fairly beamed upon him. “Good on you,
boy,” he said. “I’ll hold your coat.” The
laugh which followed helped to clear the
tension from the air. Mrs. Hogan’s tactful
“Line up. boys. It’s my shout,” completed
the process.
“Strict Ycg." : The examination-papers of
the Victorian State-school kids are all

“Stcllsby”: The mail arrangements in
war time were all in favor of the army (B.
20/10/’27). In the R.N. there was only
one address for everybody : “C/o H.M.S. ,
G.P.0., London.” Th e Admiralty conducted
its own postal delivery from there, and as I
was at different times in Eastern -waters, the
North Sea and the Mediterranean, my
letters were seldom less than six months old
when I received them. My longest spell
without a letter was 10 months. Incident-
ally, English papers reached me occasionally,
but scores of Australian ones that were
frosted never overtook me. Had I been a
member of the R.A.N. doubtless I’d have
received the lot.

“Teleg”: Isn't it about time somebody
called attention in Parliament to the out-
rageous unfairness of the official regulation
dealing with errors in telegrams? Art. 341
states: “In order to provide against mis-
takes in transmission the sender may, on
payment of 50 per cent, extra, have the mes-
sage repeated back to him from the office
of destination.” Further on, Art. 346 re-
pudiates responsibility for errors in tele-
grams of any nature whatever, whether
repeated or unrepeated. So the utmost the
helpless sender may expect, if there has been
a mistake, is a refund of the amount he has
spent in establishing the fact.

“Mullarula”: It was after a bush wed-
ding in North-Western N. S. Wales and the
supply of drinkables was running out.
Mum’s opinion was that the guests had
already had all that was good for them, and
shrewdly guessing that it wouldn’t be long
before someone would suggest driving to the
wayside pub, six miles away, for fresh sup-
plies, she had collected all the harness and
stacked it safely away under a bed. Some
thirsty souls were inquiring for the bride’s
father, but he couldn’t be found, and Jimmy
was appealed to. “Yairs,” replied the youth,
“I saw him going out of the gate in a
sulky with two of the others.” Mum
rushed to the harness plant and found it
undisturbed. “You must be mistaken,” she
told Jimmy. Jimmy grinned. “They didn’t
need no harness,” he said. “They’d put a
saddle an’ bridle on the parson’s old moke
an’ fixed rope reins on the bridle, an’ stuck
the sulky shafts through the stirrup-irons
an’ tied his tail to the swingle-bar. He was
going well, too.” Mum was horrified.
“What’ll the parson say when he finds out?”
she gasped. Jimmy opined that she needn't
worry about that. “He was the driver,” he
added. But that was 20 years ago. The
same district is now about as staid and
conventional as Dulwich Hill or Hawthorn.

The business of this Auckland-managed
co. continues to expand and premium income
sets yet another record. Profits have moved
up only a modest £5OOO, but they are the
highest since 1920. Interest and rents
(£120,780) were £8290 greater, despite
the fact that the year was a slump one for
Maoriland —a testimony to the soundness of
the co.’s investments. As happened the pre-
vious term, the amount to be distributed was
so large that the directors added yet another
penny to the div., making 2s. 3d. for the
year on £773,730 of subscribed capital repre-
sented by shares paid to 15s. This amounts
to 15 p.c., the highest nominal rate paid
since 1917 —and £450,000 of reserves has
been capitalised since then. As anticipated
by the “Wild Cat” last year another bonus
distribution is announced —£257,910, to pay
off the remaining uncalled ss. per share.
This brings paid capital up to £1,031,640,
and if next year’s distribution is the same
as this year’s (£116,060) the div. rate will
drop to a modest 111 p.c., which will look
a good deal more discreet. But the share-
holders have only put up £67,686 of cash, on
which a div. at this year's rate represents
about 170 p.c. Insurance is a very profit-
able business in competent hands, once the
long teething process has been passed. The
transfer will, of course, reduce the proportion
of reserves to paid capital considerably, but
not to an extent that will give any intelligent
policy-holder insomnia.
Losses constitute a record, and the rate
is the highest in five years, but the expense
rate continues to drop—one of the compen-
sations, from the directors’ point of view,
of the depressed conditions in Maoriland in
the last two or three years. Here are figures
for the last three decades

Fish come into the South British net from
all parts of the world —the co. does a good
deal of business in south-eastern Asia, and
its marine risks, of course, may accrue
anywhere. But despite a fairly heavy loss
rate for years past the co. keeps on smiling,
and demonstrates its managerial talent by
keeping the expense rate (including rates
and taxes at a far higher level than in
pre-war years) down to a level not very
much higher than it was a quarter of a cen-
tury ago. In the last three years over five
p.c. has been clipped off the expense ratio.
Income from investments continues to be
more than sufficient to pay dividends ; and
underwriting earnings, and a bit more, go
back into the business. The policy-holder’s
security keeps pace with the increased
risks: —

The premises item has moved upwards
£73,000-odd; mortgages have been further
reduced; “stocks, debentures and shares”—
a blanket term that requires a little elucida-
tion—have been added to but slightly, and
another substantial wad has gone into Gov-
ernment securities. Book debts are lower by
£13,000. The amount available in cash and
Government securities alone is sufficient to
pay the losses of the last three years.
South British shares, despite the increasing
prosperity of the co., have slipped a shilling in
the year—they were 595. cum. div. of ‘2s. 2d.
a year ago, and the latest quote is 58s. Id.
cum div. of 2s. 3d. The change is partly
attributable to the M.L. slump, but in the
meantime the funds backing the shares
(including the reserve for unexpired risks)
have risen from 445. Gd. to 495. Gd. per share,
so that the market has docked something off
the amount it is prepared to pay for good-
will, though it is doubtful whether it could
tell you why.

•Exclusive of Replacement and Depreciation Fund.
IPeriod covered 12 months. Fiji and Maoriland
cos. in process of liquidation. No Sept, balance-
sheet issued.
And this financial fiy-wlieel measures up
bigger even than the table suggests. There
is in addition to the reserves shown above
a replacements and depreciation fund piled
up to £1,537,623- —£43,571 was added during
the half-year—and the lot is probably true
profit. The reserve fund was last in crup
tion during May, when the £975,000 of
bonus scrip emitted fell into shareholders'
pockets in the proportion of one fully-paid
£2O share for every five held, thus making
the total bonus distributions £7,325,000,
which with £2,425,000 subscribed in
cash produces a total of £9,750,000; but
£3,900,000 of that has been returned to
shareholders, so the register at September
30 added up to £5,850,000. The p.c. div.
was, of course, a comfortable matter; it
called for £60,938 more than the March
distribution, but then absorbed only 76.7 p.c.
of the half-year’s net earnings, which sprang
£52,163 to the record figure of £476,516.
Contributing to the improvement were bigger
deliveries from the co.’s refineries required
because of the burning of the Millaquin
Co.’s refinery last April. The Fiji production
exceeded expectations; and the net profits
earned there and in Maoriland and from other
investments not subject to Federal income-
tax amounted to £232,362 compared with
£147,143 and £154,320 in the preceding
March and September halves. Losses from
floods and other causes in Queensland failed,
as they often do, to come up to the manage-
ment’s tearful estimate, and the outturn
from the co.’s four mills in that State will
be above the average. The only dull feature
on the trading side was a shrinkage in results
from the N. S. Wales North Coast, due to
late frosts, but cane from there represents
only a very small fraction of the co.’s
total crushings. The net income from Aus-
tralian sources was £244,154 compared with
£277,210 and £254,124 in the two preceding
half-years. Incidentally, only 64 p.c. of the
divs. and bonuses distributed for the 12
months to June 30 is subject to Federal
income-tax.
A freehold was bought in Westralia, where
the board has decided to establish a refinery,
and to meet the outlay that will be involved
there was £2,187,005 in surplus liquids,
including stocks, at September 30: —

Liquid surplus .. £1,999,544 £1,889,077 £2,187,005
During the half-year the amount owing to
trade creditors was reduced by no less than
£954,285 (to £426.751). The balance of
the liabilities (£2,835,705) comprise sus-
pense accounts. Cash holdings (now
£901,484) were drawn upon for £638,418;
owing to heavy sales stocks, in at £2,533,463,
were £272,658 lighter, but £329,156 was
added to book debts, making them £2,014,514.
The amount is substantial, and, though not
a word is said about provision for bad debts,
it may be taken for granted that nothing in
that way has escaped attention. Nor has
there been any over-extension of credit,
neither is there likely to be, judging from the
remarks of chairman E. W. Knox:—
[ You will have noticed the serious remarks lately
addressed to shareholders of banks and public com-
panies on the dangerous drift of the community to-
wards a financial crash. While I hold similar views
as to the critical position which may thus develop, I
cannot say that your interests will be directly affected
by trouble arising therefrom in our business. . .. Our
margin of profit is too small to stand contraction,
and the last way in which we would make a change
in the present system would be in taking paper in-
stead of cash for the sugar we have to sell.
The co.’s immediate outlook is one of
bigger tonnages. The Australian sugar pro-
duction for the current season is expected to
reach 403,000 tons compared with an esti-
mated 452,000 tons for the past season, and
150,000 tons of the export surplus has
already been sold. Next year the embargo
on foreign-grown sugar expires; and
although the Federal Government has not
yet announced its intention to renew the
restrictions, it will, no doubt, continue to
protect local producers against the competi-
tion of cheap colored foreign labor.
The market prices the scrip, which has a
net tangible backing of £2B 7s. lid., includ-
ing the replacements and depreciation fund,
at £52 12s. 6d. cum 255. div. After allowing
for the latter the return to the investor is a
shade under 5 p.c. on a 124 div. basis.

Two years ago building operations inter-
fered with turnover, but as new space be-
came available sales grew, and last year
they were the best in the co.’s history. The
result was a spring of' £B9OB to £72,025 in
the net profit, which was 12.9 p.c. on average
funds (capital and reserves) compared with
11.5, 11.1, 14.3, 16, 15.5 and 16.7 p.c. back
to 1921. Excellent results. The investor
will, however, ask why earnings did not
make a better showing last year since turn-
over was a record. One reason is that in
1921 fixed assets represented only 44.6 p.c.
of shareholders’ funds compared with 68 p.c.
at July 24 last; which means, of course,
that stocks must now work harder in order
to maintain the same rate of profit. An-
other factor which has helped to reduce the
ratio of net earnings to' average funds over
the last three years was the disclosure of
£24,149 of inner reserves in 1924. Also com-
petition amongst Melbourne’s retail soft-
goods houses has become keener in the last
half-dozen years, while overhead has grown.
In the case of Buckley and Nunn the board
is evidently so satisfied with the outlook that,
after attending to the prefs., an extra 3f
p.c. has been handed to the ords., making
16i p.c. for the year—a very juicy return
considering that almost 41 p.c. of the ord.
capital consists of bonus scrip handed out
since 1920. That is to say, the £52,656 paid
to the ords. last year was equal to nearly
274 p.c. on their capital as it stood imme-
diately prior to the 1920 gift issue. To pay
the ords. 16j p.c., after satisfying the prefs.,
shareholders’ funds as they stood at July 24
will have to earn 11.2 p.c.; and on the
figures of the last three years the lay-by will
have to be ,cut pretty fine to do it.

To meet outside liabilities amounting to
l_ j u.i2o. there were liquids—or more or
less liquids—totalling £467,850, thus leaving
a surplus of £231.730 compared with a sur-
plus of £217.190 a year earlier. Nothing is
said about the valuation of stocks (£322,928,
down £15.710), but judged on the past it
seems unlikely that they would be over-
valued.
The prefs., in which the public is mainly
interested, carry a cumulative 7 p.c. and have
priority as to capital. Last year’s net profit
was nearly seven times their annual div. re-
quirements, and the net tangible backing
amounted to £3 14s. Bd. per share. The
market values them at 225. 6d., and at that
figure they return the investor 6.2 p.c. The
ords., for which the cover is 255. 3d. in net
tangibles, seldom appear on ’Change. The
last official quote was in July, when 31s.
was offered, but no business done.

•Including to 1925 7 p.c. on £50,000 of prefs.
Thus far progress has been robust, and last
year was an exceptionally busy one. The
£183,181 netted was 16.9 p.c. on average
capital compared with 14.6, 13.3, 12.2 and
12 p.c. back to 1923. Over the same period
£556,661 of new capital was put into the
business. Until a couple of years ago little
more profit was disclosed than was neces-
sary to meet pref. requirements and pay 124
p.c. to the ords. But appearances now are
that the old policy is being modified; at any
rate, divs. called for only 71.8 p.c. of last
year’s declared net profit compared with
81.1, 91.2, 98.8 and 99.9 p.c. in the four pre-
ceding years. Nor is it likely that the board
has neglected to make internal provision
for contingencies. Reserves, however, are still
only £86,390 in excess of the £15,000 of
goodwill; and with paid capital now over
the million mark, a great deal more visible
support is necessary before the investor can
feel quite secure. Of course, the management
has been extraordinarily successful in the
past, handing shareholders an average of
11.8 p.c. p.a. for the past 33 years. Tlip
quality of the administration can best be
gauged by the fact that except in 1921 earn-
ings have escaped visible damage from the
erratic behavior of the raw rubber market—
it has meant either extraordinarily good
buying over a long period or very liberal pro-
vision inside for contingencies. A combina-
tion of the two is probably near the truth.
Shareholders’ funds (£1,166,537) will have
to earn 11.3 p.c. to pay last year's dividend
rates on paid capital as it now stands, and
that will call for a lively turnover. Cer-
tainly the co. has had no difficulty so far in
winning sales. But the past has been a period
of rapid growth in the motor trade, which,
however, now shows signs of settling down
to steadier business; and competition pro-
mises to play a larger part in the future.
A view of the business is next presented
through balance-sheet figures :
1920. 1925. 1926. 1927.
Capital . . £373,927 £779,035 £1,080,147 £1,080,147
Liabilities. 90,239 180,290 197,206 349,377

Book debts 160,748 235,379 348,613 269,019
Other assets 2,944 3,645 4,149 4,384
Although there was £377,086 of capital at
call, costing the co. 1 p.c., the board leaned
on trade creditors (£349,377, up £152,171) to
finance the additions to freeholds, plant, etc.
(£618,354, up £126,964). Thus the more or
less liquid surplus was £67,108 less than it
was a year earlier. Stocks are the largest
and most important item in the sheet, yet
not a word is said by the board about tlieir
valuation. However, taking the past as a
guide, it may be assumed that they are not
overvalued. Rubber prices tumbled from 4s.
Bd. per lb. in 1925 to Is. sd. in 1926, but
have been fairly steady between Is. 9d. and
Is. 4d. over the last 12 months. Since the
raw material represents about 60 p.c. of the
cost of the finished article in the rubber
trade, and since big manufacturers like Per-
driaus have to make heavy forward con-
tracts, the significance of the figure at which
stocks are taken into account is obvious.
To cope with the growth in business addi-
tional plant had to be installed during the
year, and £89,102 more was spent under
that head than was written off. Also £37,011
was added to the book value of freeholds,
etc. The increased trade apparently was on
a cash basis; book debts (£269,019) were
£79,594 lighter.
The prefs. are very well protected. Ther 1
are 50,000 7 p.c. firsts and 100.000 8 p.c.
seconds, and last year’s net profit was over
15 times their combined annual div. require-
ments. The cover for the firsts is £23 6s. 7d.
and for the seconds £ll 3s. 3d. in net tan-
gibles ; the former are priced at par and the
latter at 235. 3d. After allowing for the
prefs. the net tangible backing for the ords.
amounts to 21s. lOd. per fully-paid £1 share,
which the market values at 305., returning
the investor 8.3 p.c. on a 12j p.c. div. basis.

Broken Hill, after talking about it at
odd times for 40 years, has at last been
connected direct with Sydney by rail; but
whether that means a benefit to Sydney or
a still further opportunity for South Aus-
tralia’s peaceful penetration remains to he
seen. Contracts ahead mean that about two
years will elapse before it is even worth con-
sidering whether it will be cheaper, in
the long run, to get coal and other min.e sup-
plies, which form the bulk of goods-traffic to
the Hill, over the State line or around Port
Pirie as now, and the chances are that there
will be no alteration. Concentrates will, of
course, still go to Pirie, and the point
to be determined is whether the lower cost of
the direct haulage of coal, etc., from Lithgow
will be sufficient to compensate for the
inevitable increase, in the absence of full
loading both ways, on the transit of concen-
trates to Pirie, and mining men say that
it won’t. General freight, despite the dis-
advantage of greater mileage, is in favor of
Sydney and against Adelaide, mainly due to the
Silverton Tramway Co.’s chai’ges; but many
lines of merchandise cost less in the S.A.
capital than in Sydney, and if the S. T. Co.
adjusts rates, as it surely will in face of the
competition, Sydney will have a hard fight to
do much general trade.

That lot and some very minor sources
brought in £102,732 last year; obviously they
are good profit-earners. The only addition to
the list during the term was a £24,063 hold-
ing in British Metal Corp., which markets
most of the Empire’s non-ferrous metals,
including lead from the Barrier, and pays
8 p.c. To what extent, if any, the price of
lead is likely to soon recover is very uncer-
tain. The exceptional world conditions re-
sponsible for the high figures of a couple of
years ago have disappeared. The closing
down of some small producers, chiefly
Spanish and South American, and the grow-
ing demand from Germany is expected to
steady the position; but supplies are still
more than sufficient. The outlook for zinc
is a little brighter. Norths are the highest-
priced of the silver-lead stocks. A year ago
they were in demand at a little over £7;
recent cash sales were at 83s. and forward
deals 83s. 6d. At the lower figure it will
take over 10 years for the investor to get
his money back on the basis of the last
quarterly dividend (2s. per share). But
divs. will probably fall before they rise: on
present metal prices it is hard to see how
they can make the money.

There was little surprise among the shrewd
ones when the news was released that Allu-
vial Tin had sold its Malayan interests out-
right to a London bloc, subject to confirma-
tion by the shareholders at this end. When
11. E. Pratten, Malcolm Newman and broker
Macdougall left for London early in the
year, it was an open secret that their mis-
sion was to dispose of the A.T. holdings,' and
especially those in the Kinta Valley. The
only question was whether the mission would
be successful. Apparently it was. The pro-
posal is to sell the assets, subject to liabili-
ties, as on March 31 last, to London inter-
ests. The price to be paid is £750,000 —
£500,000 cash and 250,000 in shares in a
new co. to be formed with a capital of
£1,500,000. The chief object of this co. will
be to develop lands in Lower Perak, which
practically means the original co.’s Kinta
Valley holdings. London interests will sub-
scribe the contributing capital, which will
be used for equipment and development.
Alluvial’s capital was originally £50,000 in
£1 shares, of which only 20,000 were issued
and fully paid. In May, 1926, the authorised
capital was increased to £250,000; and
£230,000, part of the unidivided profits of
the co., were distributed pro rata in shares
among the shareholders. Shareholders will
receive 40s. cash for each share—including
the bonus issue—and one share in the
new co. for each one held in the old. Allu-
vial’s assets on March 31 last were £307,175.
most of it (£264.210) being shares in other
cos. Cash was £5300, and sundry creditors
(£12,517) appears to be the only liability,
a tribute to the excellent management which
has distinguished Alluvial Tin from its
beginnings, nearly five years ago.
* :!= * *
The first batch of Malayan tin returns
for October show a fall in general output
compared with the September figures, though
in some instances yardage values have in-
creased. Rawang reported 20 tons from tha
dredge and 40 tons from the sluicing plant,
which has been flooded out and will be idle
for eight weeks. Costs were 6d. per c.y.
for the dredge and 9d. for the sluicing plant.
The recovery from the dredge is diminishing,
indicating that the rich run of ground it was
following last year has petered out —the
return has averaged only 30 tons for the
last six months. After the sluicing plant
has picked out the various sweet spots, share-
holders will begin to get an idea of the real
average value of the property. Present in-
dications are that the co. will not earn
nearly the profits this year that it did last.
Malim Nawar, with 25 tons taken from
125,000 yards, dropped three tons from the
September recovery, which showed 2S tons
from 118,000 yards. Thus the average fell
also; it was * ,481 b. compared with .571 b.
per c.y. and both figures are below the
original estimate of .821 b. Malim Nawar
South did better, 35 tons from 165,000
yards as against 30 tons from 120,000 yards
the month before; but the value per yard,
which was slightly over .501 b., did not measure
up to September’s .601 b. Costs were low,
averaging 3.22 d. Kundang, working only
392 hours, returned 20 tons, making an aver-
age for the last six months of 22 tons, which
is disappointing compared with the pros-
pectus promise of 40 tons. Costs were
£2216, over 7d. per c.y. The dredge is
working down stream and will shortly have
to go through a 20ft. bank built to raise
the water level in the paddock. This means
dead work ahead and also more expense
building a further bank down stream. Alto-
gether, prospects are not bright; hence the
market prices the scrip around 275.
Kuala Kampur also had a short month of
491 hours; it got 40 tons from 170,000
yards. September figures were 40 tons from
172,000 yards, so there is a slight increase
in values per yard, though costs (3.12 d.)
were a fraction higher. The big dredge, a
sister to that at Malim Nawar South, must
be at the top of its form; its estimated
capacity was only 150.000 yards a month.
The estimated return from this area was 11b.
per yard from 20 million yards, and .661 b.
from 30 million. Recent recoveries have
been below the .601 b. mark, the latest going
under .571 b. Tanjong Tualong, which
posesses one of the biggest and most modern
dredges in Malaya, is a beginner. Its
October run shows 15 tons from a turnover
of 70,000 yards. This wmrks out at a little
over .511 b., which is below the original esti-
mate of from .661 b. to lib. per yard. There
is, however, a lot of dead digging to be done
here, and an improvement is likely.
Takuapa has slipped. October returns
show 135,000 yards turned over for 40 tons.
September yield was 50 tons from 140,000
yards; hours worked are almost identical
in each case, but values were only .711 b. as
against ,851 b. For 1926 the original dredge
averaged .731 b„ and allowing for delay in
shifting the dredge into the river and for
alterations to the jigger system, the average
will probably hold good for 1927. The new
dredge, slightly larger, is expected to be run-
ning this month. The property is estimated
to contain 32,000,000 c.y. with an average
depth of 27 feet, and going 13oz. Digging
began in May, 1925, and estimated values
have been fairly well maintained.
The big Larut combination, with its four
dredges, continues on the downward path.
October returns were 59 tons from 336,000
yards. September’s recovery was 75 tons
from 350,000 yards, and August’s 95 tons
from 359,000 yards, a gradual drop in turn-
over, recoveries and averages. Jelapang,
which began w T orking three shifts on October
10. took 22 tons from; 87,000 yards, or ,601 b.
per yard. Prospectus estimates were lib. to
the yard for 9,000.000 c. yards of the 330-
acre area, and .701 b. for the remaining
11,000,000 yards. But there was a lot of
very poor stuff in the opening turnover.
Of the Austral-Malay group, Kampong
Ivamunting also fell down on September’s
yardage and output, but No. 1 dredge was
held up for 198 hours for boiler cleaning and
screen renewals. The figures were 110,000
yards for 43 tons against 56 tons from
128,000 yards in September, when the values
were .9Slb. The October average is .871 b.
Asam, which in September got 25 tons fr.om
104,000 yards, an average of ,541 b., did
much better this time, taking 36 tons from
75.000 yards, or 1.071 b. per yard. Ulu Yam,
with a dredge shut down for the first half
of the month for screen renewals, got 11
tons from 61,000 yards for September, aver-
aging .401 b. October’s figures for the full
month were 21 tons from 104,000 yards, or
,451 b. per yard. Thabawleik recovered 61
tons from 96,000 yards: average 1.421 b., a
drop from the September average of 1.761 b.
In this group IJlu Yam’s costs (4.5 d. per
cy.) were the lowest; Asam’s highest
(7.5 d.).
Nawng Pet, the sluicing show which is
included in the Malay-Siamese holdings, re-
covered 11 tons from 22,000 yards in 415
hours. The average yardage. 1.21 b., is a
long drop from that of September, when
19.8. tons were won from 29.706 yards, or
close on 1.61 b. the c.y. Phin Soon, the co.’s
open-cast show, bettered its September aver-
age, recovering 26.3 tons from 29,000 yards,
the September figures being 25.3 tons from
30,000 yards.

“Collins Street” : The Melbourne market for
tin shares is very sick, thanks to the records
of companies floated there during last year's
boom. Bidor originally proposed to equip
its property with a bucket dredge of 180,000
yards capacity, delivery at end of 1927;
latest report is that the property has been
placed under option “on satisfactory terms.”.
Sales of eontrib, shares paid to Bs. 6d. have
been made as low as 3s. Peninsula Tin was
registered in April, 1926, but the dredge was
not ordered until July, 1927; shares paid to
10s. are selling at 2s. Id. Tinsongklila
ordered its dredge and made all preparations
for building same; in fact, had gone so far
as to dig a paddock for it on one of the
leases, but lost a law suit with the vendor.
Meanwhile the dredge had arrived at the
nearest railway station and lay there for
some months. The leases are now uncon-
nected and the dredge is being built on one
of them. Kopah also seems to be having-
trouble of some sort. Satupulo, about the
only one which seems to be making satis-
factory progress with the building of its
dredge, should be under steam in December.
Very little effort is being made to resuscitate
Lampeh beyond putting a small dredge ou-
tlie property, while Changphra, although
floated in September 1926, seems asleep.
Shares are only called to 2s. 6d., and there is
no mention of a dredge having been ordered.
Tujoh and Rangeng were recently under-
written and floated, but nothing further
seems to have been done.

Independent of suggested amalgamation
schemes, something may be done with the
Golden Horseshoe. It is stated that London
is prepared to start afresh by forming a new
co. comprised of only contributing shares;
London to subscribe half the. issue and Aus-
tralia half. Incidentally, it is expected the
Westralian Government would not be too
hard concerning the £50,000 cash advance
sunk in the mine. If the terms of share
subscriptions were liberal, it is probable tri-
butors would take up Australia’s quota—not
only residents of Kalgoorlie, but Golden Mile
miners scattered over Australia. If the
leases of the Horseshoe and Ivanlioe were
thrown open, there would follow as genuine
a “Back to Kalgoorlie” movement as could
be wished. Rightly or not, old Golden Belt
miners believe that they could repeat the
successes of Great Boulder and Perseverance
tributors were they given the chance in the
Horseshoe and Ivanhoe.
❖ ❖ ❖ *
W.A. Mines Minister Munsie is busy in-
specting gold shows and granting loans
from the State Mines Development Vote to
owners who have decent prospects. There
is a difference, of course, between a loan and
a grant, and what most Westralian lease-
holders are chasing at present is a grant
from Bruce’s £185,000 to revive mining. So
far no one has succeeded in securing a pound
of this, and Bruce should soon be asking
why. Munsie has certainly promised to
rebate the premium paid by leaseholders to
cover certain liabilities under the Miners’
Phthisis Compensation Act, and this, he
states, will be appropriated from the grant
at the rate of about £40,000 annually. At
first it was understood the rebate would
apply to only Kalgoorlie cos., but Munsie
has since explained that it applies to all
mine-owners. The rebate is a windfall to
the industry, though Kalgoorlie will not
really benefit as the Kurrawang Firewood
Co. has simultaneously increased prices of
firewood. The rebate does not throw light
on the whereabouts of the £165,000, as it
will be largely a book-keeping matter within
the State Insurance Department. Perhaps
Premier Collier might have some difficulty
in producing the grant in cash if lie were
asked for it.
❖ * * *
As expected, a fierce tug-o’-war is pro-
ceeding over tlie proposed extension of the
W.A. railway to Wiluna. There is little
doubt the Government will build at an early
date, and Kalgoorlie is working hard,
through its State members, to have the
extension made from Leonora and not Meeka-
tliarra or Sandstone. Wiluna favors one of
the two latter points, as that route would
render either Geraldton or Fremantle avail-
able as a port. As the Wiluna treatment
plant will be moved by crude-oil engines
aggregating 10,000 h.p., crude oil will be an
item of rail transport, and Geraldton is
about 200 miles nearer Wiluna than Fre-
mantle is. Whether the oil cos. would agree
to make Geraldton a port is another matter.
In any event, Wiluna is not so much con-
cerned about the route as it is about get-
ting the railway somehow. Meanwhile the
Wiluna Co- is still experimenting with gold
extraction processes, which indicates that
the extraction percentage isn’t all that is
desired.
* * * *
Brilliant Co., working the Gnow’s Nest
mine at Yalgoo (W.A.), has added 6d. to a
long run of calls and made an alteration in
the management. The co. is meeting with
much difficulty in extending its long bottom
level crosscut to the reef, but shareholders
have, in depressing circumstances, paid up
handsomely. After the reef has been struck
at the bottom level, the co. may consider
the advisableness of stoping out all avail
able ore and then abandoning the show.
* * * *
It is good news that a geological survey of
the Lakes Entrance district, Gippsland, is
in progress in accordance with the wish of
the Federal Government, which will bear
half the cost. This long-delayed job will be
of great help to those who retain faith in
the possibilities of revealing either a natural
gas-well or an oil-well. Numerous bores be-
tween Sale and Orbost in tertiary strata in-
dicate that there is a gas reservoir of con-
siderable dimensions at about 800 feet from
the surface. In America the experience has
been that where natural or oil-bearing gas,
sometimes called a “wet gas,” occurs, crude
petroleum itself is not far away.
❖ He
New Guinea Gold continues to show
energy and initiative in the development of
its Bulolo properties. The co. was the first
to institute an aeroplane service from the
beach to the field, and now a second ’plane
has been landed at Lau, on the coast, n.-e.
of Salamoa. This obviated the 500-mile
flight from Rabaul which the first machine
had to tackle, and the addition to the ser-
vice will be used to carry freight and pas-
sengers. It is estimated that at least 300
carriers will be released for work on the
claims, while the saving in time and costs
will be tremendous.
* * * *
Mt. Isa faces a period of intensive drilling
operations, and Russo-Asiatic engineer
McDermott has preliminaries under way.
The heads of the co. are said to believe that
the treatment of Isa’s carbonate ores is
easy; but that doesn’t mean anything. Years
before Broken Hill learned how to get profit
from its sulphides Professor Schnabel re-
ported that there were 25 ways of treating
the ore. Railway construction is getting on
fairly well; the job has advanced to the 40-
mile peg.

PERSONAL
ITENS
In the Sydney ferry tragedy the nerve
and courage of the children stood out above
all else. Kenneth Horley, a 13-year-older,
was seen to sink twice and was given up
for drowned. Yet he battled through the
long swim to Bradley’s Head. Then there
was an unknown school girl. She was
gripping a piece of timber when Jones, a
deckhand who did great work, swam to her.
“Look after that girl over there,” she said,
“I’m all right.”
Alexander Adams is one of those Maori-
land judges who were born and bred in
the Rickety Isles. His father was an Otago
pioneer of the late ’forties. Dunedin Uni.
gave him the right to practise law 44 years
ago, and he became Crown Solicitor in the
Scotsbyterian town in 1920. After holding
the job for a year lie vacated it to make way
for his son, and ascended to the Supreme
JUSTICE ADAMS, of Maoriland.
iCourt Bench. By religion a Baptist, and by
conviction an inveterate foe of the Demon
Rum, he has been president of the Baptist
Union and the Prohibition Alliance, and
delivers homilies on the curse of drink, when
a suitable occasion occurs, that are reminis-
cent of those that Stout, cx-C..T., used to
unleash. A good, SPund judge of law, and
one whose decisions are not often upset.
AVilliam Tilley, who brought his know-
ledge of the working of a Stock Exchange
from Charters Towers to Sydney over a quar-
ter of a century ago, lias just left his share-
broking firm to his junior partners —sou
Frank and Dr. Hordern, the one-time trick
bowler. In his earliest days Wm. Tilley
was a tanner ; in his later days he has made
a profitable hobby of company management.
It began when he secured the help of his
friends to buy the Hotel Australia from its
then English owners, who were terrified that
Australia was going dry. To the list of
boards which keep him busy he has just
added the A.P.A., the insurance concern
whose internal squabbles should have
wrecked it, but by a miracle didn’t.
L. C. M. S. Amery, the British Dominions
Minister now visiting Australia, is unique
among English statesmen in his remarkable
gift for foreign tongues. Probably the faculty
is derived from his mother, herself a lin-
guist and a sister of Dr. Gottlieb Wilhelm
Leitner, an Oriental scholar who could
prattle his way anywhere east of Suez in
25 languages and dialects. The Leitners
were Austrian Jews. Fraulein Leitner met
Amery’s father in Lahore, where her brother
was principal of the Government College.
Edward Haynes, who recently took the
long road, was a newchum who struckj
the luck which is sometimes used as a
story property by English novelists. Arriv-
ing in Sydney when he was 20, he set out
with three mates for the Rocky diggings.
Before a year had passed, the quartette had
piled up £16,000. Haynes had no desire to
return to Ireland with his fortune—he lived
his life out in the New England district.
The old man objected strongly when he
was taken to hospital. He declared that he
had not had the attention of a doctor all his
99 years, and he had never taken medicine,
and lie didn’t want either in his old age.
To save Geelong the trouble of chartering
a special train to send to Melbourne all the
people who wished to demonstrate in his pre-
sence against the extension of the Metro-
politan Board of Works’ sewage farm in
the direction of the Pivot, Health Minister
Beckett went to Geelong. The deputation
•packed the Town Hall. It was far from
being a record. A couple of thousand Cold
Tea disciples came to Premier Bent about 20
years ago to make a few Dry remarks, lie
took the crowd to the main hall of the
Exhibition. A week or two later Bung organ-
ised a larger muster to smash the argu-
ments of “the other side.” It, too, was
taken to the Exhibition. As the hall cost
him nothing Bent did not mind the double
shout.
Surgeon Lieut.-Commander Paradice, one of
the victims of the Sydney ferry disaster, was
the scientific officer with H.M.A.S. Geranium
on its survey cruise in 1923 in Northern Aus-
tralian waters. Amongst the 2000 specimens
of sea life and sundries he brought back was
the several-million-year-old fossil foot imprint
of the Ichthyosaurus australis now in the
Australian Museum. Paradice won his M.B.
and Ch.M. at Sydney Uni.
Australia lost a fine type of bushman
when Boady Griffiths crossed the Divide.
He was the first white child born on Mort’s
squattage at Bodalla (N.S.W.). There and
along the N.S.W. South Coast he spent
his 77 years, and most inhabitants of the
region at one time or other benefited by
his goodfellowship. In his day he was an
all-round athlete, and when age led him
from the field lie took the forum as the
South Coast authority on sport and sports-
men.
Vic. Assembly has one full colonel,
Bourchier, who carries the D.S.O. and
C.M.G. decorations, and two lieut.-colonels,
Forrest aqd Knox. All arc dinkum soldiers
and sit on the Opposition side. The colonel
with the shortest service in the Assembly
was Templeton, who in the boom-bursting
time was a company liquidator. About 30
years ago he was elected for Benalla and
Yarrawonga, but Tom Kennedy—still going
strong as a farmer —outed him on a petition
before the poor man had his seat properly
warm. Kennedy was afterwards in the
Reps., and for a while was chairman of the
Vic. Closer Settlement Board.
R. W. Dawson, until lately stock inspector
at Goulburn (N.S.W.), has been enjoying
most of his 74th year. About 12 months
ago he left Australia bound for his son’s
cstancia in Patagonia. The country pro-
vided plenty of interest and excitement for
the Australian visitor. One morning a
messenger arrived on a jaded horse with the
information that bandits were approaching.
The estancia was put in a state of siege.
The governess and children were placed in
one room, the women were armed with rifles
—every woman can shoot—and the maids —
who cannot be trusted —locked up. But
there was no blood-letting. A posse arrived,
and, aided by Dawson, jun., and several of
his men, captured the bandits while they
were resting their horses at a little stream
before moving on to the estancia.
Arthur Davis, known to hundreds of thou-
sands as Steele Rudd, started work as a clerk
in the Sheriff’s Office, Brisbane. On the
eve of a double execution in Boggo-road
gaol the hangman called. “Well, young
man,” he said, “are you coming over
to see the fun to-morrow morning?” “I
am not,” said Davis with disgust. “You
don’t mean to tell me you’ll miss the
chance of seeing a man and woman taking
the drop at the same time,” exclaimed the
hangman. “They’ll both go off like this.”
Making a clicking noise with his tongue, he
placed a clammy hand on the back of Davis’s
neck and squeezed it. Davis was off the
stool in a flash and shaped up to the guardian
of the rope. “Put your dirty fingers on me
again,” he snapped, “and I’ll drop you as cold
as yon drop your unfortunate clients.” The
astonished hangman left hurriedly.
Dick Toutcher, who has just completed 30
years’ continuous service as a member of
Vic. Assembly, has never had the luxury
of a walkover. He had to fight his way
into Parliament —Ararat was his first seat —
and he has had to fight 13 times to stay
there. Toutclier’s political pickings have not
been glittering—a seat on the Railway Com-
mittee for a few years and then the Minister-
ship of Education (1924) for 12 weeks. As
head of the directorate he presided at the
annual conference of the A.N.A. at Bendigo
in March, IS9S, when the Federal Conven-
tion’s Constitution (Draft) Bill was accepted
by the delegates. Before taking to politics
he was a Customs officer.
DR. A. E.
FLOYD ,
Melbourne’s
City Organist.
The grand old
man of Queens-
land’s R.C. clergy
is Philip Corrigan,
of Brisbane, now
in his seventies.
He was the white-
haired boy of Bris
bane a half-century back, when he was
reputed to oe Queensland’s champion all-
round athlete. For many years he had the
record for long-distance journeys on horse-
back in Western Queensland. On one occa-
sion he rode for three days with only a few
hours’ rest.
Tommy Farouliar, the Thursday Island
pearl king, took over from Frank Sommers,
who with his brother first brought diving gear
to Torres Strait. By persistence and hard
graft Farquliar worked up a fleet of his
own. He always had a keen eye for pearls,
and enough have passed through his hands
to ransom a kingdom. Farquliar sailed the
coral seas in the days when the Strait island-
ers were maneaters, and when the seas were
decked with blackbirders and birds like
Nicholas the Greek and birds-o’-war chasing
them. Strange to say, though an exciting
life lies behind him, the thing Farquliar
likes to remember most is that he was a
champion oarsman in his day.
“Count Drolatique” : The Melbourne world
has almost forgotten Chummy Fleming, the
anarchist who used to blow up Capital with
big, vague words on the Yarra Bank.
Fleming, who is a man of irreproachable
character, will, when challeneged, still allege
the retention of his wildest convictions.
But prosperity takes the edge off the fierce-
ness of the revolutionary, and Fleming now
owns the title-deeds to his own home. He
has christened the place Ilopetoun, after
Australia’s first Governor-General, who, at the
height of one of Fleming’s lonely campaigns
against “the ruling class,” gave the orator a
load of champagne to distribute among the
poor.
A recent visitor to Yass (N.S.W.) was
George Noble, an aboriginal who must be
nearing 00. Well known as Marvellous, he
was one of the home-grown kings presented
to the Duke and Duchess at Canberra. Mar-
vellous remembers the time ivlien there were
thousands of full-blooded aborigines on the
Murray and Murrumbidgee, and he was in
the big Gundagai flood in which 65 lives
were lost. He looks as if he will notch the
century.
Bob Croll, registrar of Vic. Council of
Public Education and general utility man in
the Education Department, has walked over
nearly the whole of Vic. and a tidy strip
of adjoining States. He knows more about
amateur athletics than a groundful of spec-
tators, and has radical views on fishery de-
velopment that almost keep pace with those
of Chief See. Prendergast. Once he helped
to shape a Budget and give a literary flavor
to a Treasurer’s statement. His recent pro-
motion to senior clerk in the Education
Department is looked upon as the first step
to a bigger job.
As an educationist, David Wiley’s en-
thusiasm was geography; and although he
retired from the position of headmaster of
the Newtown school, Sydney, in 1910, when
he reached his 61st birthday, he remained a
voluntary instructor in his pet subject right
up to the time of his death. Wiley was the
man responsible for the introduction of
manual training into the N.S.W. State
schools. He started as a teacher in a
denominational school in the days when State
schools were used only by the very poor, but
he spent over 40 years in the service.
Frank Clarke, President of Vic. Plush
Chamber and head of the House Committee,
is making a hobby of the Parliamentary
gardens. If he can get his way the north and
south ends will be made show places.
Gardens and gardening are no new fancies of
Clarke’s. His illustrated booklet on Mel-
bourne Botanical Gardens is prized by the
friends among whom he circulated it.
The last survivor of the expedition de-
spatched in 1865 to find Leichhardt has
passed. John McCalman was born at Oban,
Scotland, 85 years ago. He came to Aus-
tralia when a child, his early years being spent
in the Shoalhaven (N.S.W.), but lie later
moved across the Murray. McCalman fol-
lowed the Maoriland gold rushes, but returned
to Victoria to join the expedition to search
for Leichhardt, the explorer. The party left
Swan Hill in June. Duncan Mclntyre, leader
of the expedition, met them at the Darling,
whence, after many hardships and privations,
they reached Queensland. No trace of the
explorer was found; McCalman returned
after three years in the Northern Terri-
tory. He subsequently owned many pas-
toral properties in N.S.AV.
A newly-elected member in the N.S.W.
Assembly enters Parliament as his political
godson departs. It was the casting vote
of Dan Clyne, elect of King, in favor of Jim
Dooley 20 years ago that put the rotund
Lithgow • tailor into politics. Dooley beat
John Hurley, the sitting member for Hart-
ley, by a few votes and held it until the
Langites pushed him out in the last selection
ballot. Clyne is a Bathurst (N.S.W.)
native.
Cotter, Hughes and Murphy are thorns in
the side of the Vic. Labor Ministry in
caucus. Cotter has, perhaps, most reason to
feel resentful against the party. After many
years’ service he failed to secure nomination
to the Chairmanship of Committees. Murphy
was one of the two runners-up for a salaried
job in the Ministry, and Hughes was beaten
by a fellow-Digger (Pollard) for the Railway
Committee. Needless to say, those who suc-
ceeded are much more philosophical.
With Dominions Secretary Amery is
Captain Brass, late of the Royal Air Force,
now M.P. for the Lancashire Division of
Clitheroe and Parliamentary Secretary to
Neville Chamberlain. Brass set out from
England with 10,000 feet of film. Already
half of it has been used up, and as any
bullock-waggon on the road is worth 20
feet the supply won’t see the trip out.
Brass intends sparing time from picture-
taking to look over a few factories and
Point Cook’s air ’buses.
Chief-Sec. BRUNTNELL, of N. S. Wales,
a Brigadier-Gen. of the Salvation Army
before he took to politics.
The five Early Closing Act inspectors
thrown out by the new N.S.W. Government
were strong Lang supporters. They were J.
P. (“Digger”) Dunn, who was an unsuccess-
ful Federal Senate candidate; Arthur Ruth-
erford, secretary of the Saddlers’ Union
before the appointment; Oscar Bryant, who
was secretary of the Australasian Engineers;
Oscar Bergen, who was secretary of the
Plumbers’ Union; and Mrs. Duncan, of the
Newcastle Trades Hall.
ARMISTICE DAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Nine years ago the war that war might cease
Was waged and won. Behind was left the
woe.
We glimpsed ahead the piping times of
peace—
Nine years ago.
Nine years ago in storied hall they met,
The greatest of the earth, the seed to sow
For all earth’s reaping. Is there harvest yet?
Nine years ago!
What though the thunder of the guns be
stilled
Where the embattled line bent to and fro,
For more than that we hoped and strove to
build
Nine years ago.
Saw we not stayed, beside the toll of life •
In blood-soaked trenches by a foreign foe,
The din of warring class and factions’ strife,
Nine years ago?
Four years of war! How many past must
fly
Before the earth her travail shall outgrow?
Ah! we were passing sanguine, you and I,
Nine years ago.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
“Sea Nomad”: A most feared magic
among the Torres Islanders is “kamer.” It
has the appearance of a red powder, and is
apparently the decayed remains of a fungus
that grows in driftwood from New Guinea.
The stuff is carefully scraped by an arrow
point into a bamboo stem, the sorcerer being
masked with a banana-leaf so that he may
not inhale any of the poison. To make it still
more virulent, decomposed matter of red
coral is mixed with it; the scraped kernel
of a rotten goa-nut is added. The spiky
rib of a cocoanut leaf is placed in the mix-
ture and then poked into bananas or yams,
which tainted food is presented to the uncon-
scious victim. He does not die immediately,
but a nasty disease burns out his throat. If
a girl is jealous of a rival she touches this
other huzzy’s nostrils with the tip of a frigate-
THE EXPERT.
MOTORIST (to wife): “I’m coming on with my driving all right. D’you notice how I
pulled over to avoid running over his head?”
bird’s feather, previously dipped in kamer,
when she sleeps. The nose is the first to
go, then the throat, then the wench herself.

“Gordelphus”: I was in charge of an out-
camp on a Gascoyne (W.A.) cattle-station,
and had several abos. to give me a hand in
looking after the stock. One night one of
them came over and squatted at my camp-
fire. “Boss,” he said, “Long Charlie bin
sayem point medicine bone long us feller J
One of us feller die pretty damn quick.” I
told him not to be a fool, and sent him to his
camp. A few days later he was back again.
"That fella medicine longa Charlie’s bone
plurry strong, boss,” he said. “He bin tellem
us feller pointem bone pretty soon now. I
reckon must be you send Charlie pinkeye
[holiday]. You nothing send Charlie pink-
eye we killem.” I explained that Charlie's
medicine couldn’t do them any harm. I
spoke to Charlie, too, but he wouldn’t admit
owning a bone. Soon afterwards I had to go
to the home station for stores. When I got
back Binglii came along looking very pleased
with himself. “All right now, boss,” he
informed me. “Charlie medicine bone nothing
hurt us feller now. We killem.” “What!” I
shouted. “We killem Charlie an’ buryem
longa waterhole. Bullock-tracks coveremup
marks. Nothing frighten now, boss.” And
Binghi strolled back to his camp and his
Mary with the air of one who hadn’t a care
in the world.
* * * *
“Mapee”: A small fish that seems to keep
strictly within its own district inhabits the
waters of Dungowan Creek, Liverpool Plains
(N.S.W.). It is known locally as the blue-
fish. Four or five inches long at maturity,
it is shaped something like a cod, but has no
scales, and is very dark blue on the back,
fading down the sides to a white belly. It
is delicious eating, having firm white flesh
and no annoying bones. It may be readily
caught with a very small hook, or even a
bent pin, baited with a small earthworm.
Although the Dungowan is connected by
running streams with the whole of the
western watershed, I have never known this
fish to be found anywhere else.

“Ming”; Some years ago I witnessed an
extraordinary migration from the Poverty
Bay district of M.L. For over .three hours
one morning dragon-flies, by no means nor-
mally common in the country, flew over our
house in a black column. The air was dark
with the handsome creatures, as, flying in
couples, wing to wing, they poured through
the sunlight out to sea. Why and whence
they migrated in millions remains a mystery,
and as their course was set over thousands
of miles of ocean their destiny was appa-
rently a watery finish.

“G.R.F.”: I question the veracity of the
■Tap diver who unshipped the life-line from
his body and fastened it to a rock (B.
13/10/’27). Divers I have known would
as soon have taken off their boots on the
ocean bed. were that possible, as have parted
with their life-lines. A pearling lugger at
work drifts slowly with the tide, its speed
being regulated by the anchor, round the
fluke of which the chain is so hitched that
it prevents the hook getting a firm grip
of the ground. When the diver comes to
a patch of shell he signals with his life-line
to stop the drift, and this is done by paying
out more chain, thus allowing the anchor
to settle in the mud. I have never known
a shark attack a dress diver; the only
danger from the monsters is that they may
foul the life-line or air-pipe. If one
approaches, it is easily scared away by
opening the elastic band round the wrist of
the diving dress: the escape of air sends
the sea pirate scudding away at the rate of
knots. The same effect can be obtained by
rubbing the feet on the ocean floor, causing
the mud or sand to rise.
EASILY EXPLAINED.
THE MAID: “Oh go away! You’re the dirtiest tramp I’ve ever seen. And you smell
something awful.”
THE TRAMP: “Yes, Miss. I’ve gone ’igh in me perfession, you might say.”
“Te W.”: The turtle eggs sepulchred by
“Murray” (B. 20/10/’27) would require the
heat of the sun to incubate them. The period
of incubation varies, but a batch of eggs
buried in autumn should hatch out next
summer. Some of the eggs may, however,
prove addled. The river and lagoon “turtle,”
so called, is in fact the tortoise known to
science as Chelidon longi collis. True turtles
are found only in salt water. Tortoises are
very slow growers. I met one recently on
its way to a lagoon, and it measured only
about four inches long, yet it might have
been a good many years old. The tortoise
nas great faith in the protective power of its
shell. Overtaken on a highroad by a horse-
waggon or other heavy vehicle, it will stop
dead and retire into its shell, the result being
not infrequently a tortoise crushed as flat
as a pancake.

“Coot”: “Native bread” (Mylitta aus-
tralis) is a fungus growth, and not the,
hardened sap from a tree. As to
“Tassie’s” query (B. 20/10/’27) wliether
any use has been found for it, it is
recorded in “Proceedings of the Royal
Society of Van Diemen’s Land, 1848,” that
“ ‘native bread,’ grated and made into a
pudding with milk, alone or combined with
double its weight of rice or sago, had been
found very palatable by a member” ; more-
over, “it had been eaten with approval in
soup, after the manner of truffle, to which
it is nearly allied.” Then in 1857, in “The
Cruise of the Beacon,” Dr. Milligan wrote:
“But that which afforded the largest amouut
of solid nutritious matter was the ‘native
bread,’ a fungus growing in the ground.” As
a rule, however, whites have never taken
kindly to it as an article of diet.
* *
“Gouger”: Tropical abo. tribes whose
living comes from the waters are experts at
signalling when submerged. Two hard, flat
stones tapped sharply together transmit mes-
sages to long distances. This form of under-
water telegraphy enabled communication to be
kept up when a raiding party of N.-T. myalls
attacked a hereditary enemy, whose strong-
hold was in the heart of a dismal tropical
swamp. The attackers entered the morass
in the gloaming and pushed on as fast as
possible until about ten o’clock, when they
huddled together on a reedy island awaiting
in silence' the settling down of the dreaded
spirits of the night. During the small hours
they advanced, shoulder to shoulder in cres-
cent form, wading where possible. In the
chill of dawn they drew close to the camp of
the sleeping enemy. The crescent advanced
in skirmishing order, then the units of the
line dived simultaneously aud swam under
water, cleverly manoeuvring their spears
and womcras. Before taking the first ripple-
less plunge each warrior had marked ahead
the distance he could swim, choosing some
objective where the broad-leafed water-lilies
floated, or a clump of reeds merged into the
water. There he could float on the surface
to breathe and yet be quite invisible. Each
man in position signalled to his fellows by
tapping two stones under water. After a
breather, the signal was transmitted for the
next advance. It was a bleak dawn and
cloudy when the \ raiders touched the reeds
fringing the island camp. A few sleepy-
eyed gins were fanning the camp-fire ashes.
The raiders snaked their way through the
reeds, and the concerted war-cry was caught
up in a panic-filled shriek as the first flight
of spears stung the camp.
* * * *
“W.G.”: Fraser Island, 30 miles from
Maryborough, is one of Bananaland's beauty
spots. In many parts of it are natural palm-
groves with freshwater creeks flowing
through them. These creeks generally start
from springs, and the water is beautifully
pure and clear. Enhancing the beauty of
the palms, orchids, especially tile box and
pencil varieties, together with staghorn and
elkhorn ferns, cling to their long straight
trunks. Other ferns, such as the crowsnest,
are also numerous. And there is a peculiar
plant with branches composed of long, thin,
hairy leaves which resemble a fox’s tail.
The flower has the same shape and color
as Scotland’s heather.
* * * *
“Ilinemoa” (M.L.) : The butter-fish de-
scribed by “Kayeff” (B. 8/9/’27) isn’t a bit
like the Maoriland fish of the same name. The
chap over here is glossy black in color, and
usually measures a foot to 18in. in length,
though I have seen them bigger. They are
never scaled, but always skinned for the
pan, and the flesh is very white, of a deli-
cious flavor and very fine in texture. The
bones are a vivid green, the color of verdigris,
and many a newchum has thrown the deli-
cacy away thinking that the tucker must be
poisonous. I have never heard of them
travelling in shoals; in fact, they do not
seem to be plentiful.
* * # *
“G. Bung”: Fishing for sharks at night
on Ocean Island, Jack Sheahan, aged 16,
caught a codfish over 3501 b. in weight. He
was being dragged off the rocks into the
water when a couple of Kanakas came to his
assistance. Some idea of the size of this
tiddler can be got from the fact that a
grinning Kanaka was able to put his head
and shoulders into the cod’s mouth f q
demonstrate that “this feller can kai-kai
boy.”

Australia# Best-
Best for Australians:
All motorists will be interested in
the aftermath of Mrs. G. Sandford’s
Transcontinental Tour.
Some weeks back publicity was given by us to the fact that the New Zealand
motorist, Mrs* G. Sandford, had driven across the Australian Continent
four times — Sydney to Fremantle — back to Adelaide — thence northwards
to Darwin — returning once more to Adelaide and back via Melbourne to
Sydney-a total distance of 11,000 miles on one set of Australian-made
Dunlop Tyres. Considering the nature of country traversed and the fact
that the ESSEX COACH, loaded up with camping equipment, fuel, etc.,
weighed close on two tons, and not a cover was replaced during the
strenuous undertaking — it was unquestionably a fine demonstration of the
Quality, Service and Dependability built into this Australian production*
Mrs* Sandford thought so _ and so did we!
Our publicity in connection with this lady's fine drive was not put forth
with a view of claiming the mileage as a record one for Dunlop Tyres, but
as an outstanding tyre service demonstration when the unusual conditions
of that long tour were considered.
This publicity has brought forth from various parts of Australia a surprising
result — a sheaf of letters from “ Dunlop" users, which were as unexpected
as they are gratifying to us as Australian manufacturers.
Whilst not endeavoring to belittle Mrs. Sandford’s Transcontental motoring achievements,
our correspondents are apparently not satisfied that the 11,000 miles travelled on the one
set of tyres does Dunlop Service full justice.
Private motorists in city and country, truck owners and drivers, bus proprietors, etc., etc.,
have, unasked (but none the less fully appreciated by us\ sent along many amazing figures
relative to the mileages they have obtained from Australian-made “ Dunlops.” Here are a
f ew H. Bearhead, 79*640 miles on set of five tyres ; F. Higgins, 28*356 miles ;
J. Esmond, 17,000 miles; Webb’s Motors, 33,000 miles witli set oia
motor bus; G. Ireland, 18*050 miles; Messrs. Evans, Retread Service Station,
21*103 miles; A. Callaghan, 20*000 miles on driving wheel and 3000 on front
wheel; T. McDonald, 31*000 miles; Reo Bus Service, 23*000 miles; Wall Bros.,
25*000 miles; Miss A. Foley, 13*387 miles; Mrs. N. Cooper, 13*675 miles
on set without a puncture.
Our Correspondents — as a matter of loyalty
and appreciation — took pleasure in notifying us of their experience
and satisfaction of Dunlop mileage.
We value their loyalty _ and thank them!
* * *
We do not claim that all motorists can expect such huge mileages, but we do say
this : Fit Dunlop — keep them always evenly and properly inflated — handle the
brakes and clutch carefully — and you can with confidence look forward to tyre
service that will well repay and satisfy you.
* * *
If you are not a Dunlop user it will pay you to be one!

HAS DECLARED WAR ON RUST!!
Let FERRODOR defend your steel structures against the ravages of rust and corrosion
caused by the action of moisture-laden atmosphere, chemical fumes, etc., etc.
FERRODOR is manufactured in England, its base being a natural metallic powder
which contains up to 95 per cent, of rustless peroxide of iron. The peroxide cannot absorb
further oxygen, so that the oil of the paint is not destroyed as in ordinary red oxide, and
thus the passage of oxygen from the air, through the Ferrodor Paint to the metal surface,
is rendered impossible.

“Kayeff” : The kookaburras who took the
count through dining on a high-voltage line at
Grafton (vide "Lauda.” B. 13/10/27) were
not the first to meet their Waterloo in that
town. The cleaners of the northern N.S.W.
city have a standing job of gathering up
electrocuted birds. But the most frequent
casualties are among flying-foxes, which
abound along the tree-planted streets. Their
wide-spread wings span the distance between
wires of opposite polarity, and the voltage
from Nymboida does the rest. Their charred
bodies lie in numbers beneath the wires.
Many also get hooked up in the conductors,
and slowly frizzle away. A noticeable dim-
ming of the town’s light supply is usually
attributed to a branch falling across the
wires, but just as often it is due to a spread-
eagled fruit-eater.

“C. Coral”: “Yankee Ned” was a run-
away seaman who came of a good Baltimore
(LT.S.A.) family. Finding his way to Nortli
Aus. in the early pearling days, he managed
to acquire a small fleet of vessels and
settled at York Island with a native w’ife,
who is still alive.
Many of the pearls
that came his way
be retained, keeping
them in small bags
which he placed in
a canvas - covered
and stoppered
bottle. To his four
sons he explained
that he was storing
them against the
time when he
would take the
family to Baltimore
for a trip. Going
over the contents of
the bottle one even-
ing, he fancied he
saw the figure of a
stranger outside the
window’ watching
him. Next morning
he told his sons
that lie was bury-
ing the horde with-
in a pair of big
clamshells at a
sandy spot near by.
The old seadog died
on Thursday Island
not long after, but
though the family
made diligent
search the bottle
has never been
found. Several
interested white
visitors have offered
to assist in the
search, but the boys
prefer to keep it
within the family.
As the eldest son
said the other day :
“We think he want
too much commis-
sion if he find him !
Besides, suppose he
find bottle and for-
get to tell us he find him!”

“Wang” : “I was walkin’ acrost a paddick
one day,” said Larry the Liar, “w’en I was
chased be a bull. The long-’orned devil was
jist on, me w’en I spots a big ’oiler log lyin’
on the bank o’ the river. I dove inter one
end of it like a rabbit into a burrer, with the
hull's ’orns just touchin’ me ’ind quarters.
Then —holy frost!—within six inches o’ me
nose is the great gran’father of all tiger-
snakes. I back-pedals, yelling. The bull’s
pawin’ an’ snortin’ outside me ’aven o’
refuge, an’ I reckon I’d sooner be gored t’
death than be snake-bitten. The hull makes
a poke at me as I come out, an’ I dive
forrard agin. The snake musta got the
wind up. for V slithers outer the other end
OUT WHERE THEY GET METEOROLOGY BY THE FOOT.
“Looks a bit like rain this morning
“By the way my corn is shooting there must ha’ been a good shower in the night.”
o’ the log. The bull’s rushed around to that
end, an’ as the snake comes out he treads on
it an’ it curls round one of ’ees legs. The
bull gives a roar an’ starts jumpin’ about,
an’ bumps agin the side o’ the log an’ sets
it rollin’ down the bank inter the river.
As I’m turnin’ over an’ over a coupla loose
wax-matches in me pocket gets alight
an ’sets fire to me ’anky. I manages to
pull the burnin’ rag out, an’ strike me lucky
if it doesn’t set fire to the dry loose stuff
lyin’ in the log! In a brace o’ shakes the
insider the log is a ragin’ furnace. We ’it
the water, an’ the log goes floatin’ along with
the burnin’ end stickin’ up, my weight keepin’
the other end down. Luck’ly fer me, I finds
a nole in the side of the log jist big enough t’
stick me ’ead out of. An ’wot d’yer think ?
There’s a coupla blokes on the bank fisliin’ !
They yanked me out jist in time.”
“Pythos” : The wedge-tailed eagle referred
to by “AdeL” (B. 29/9/’27) is new to me.
I have never seen or heard of wedge-tails
catching anything in the air; they are not
quick enough. Their flight does not compare
with that of the brown and bullet hawks
that prey on small birds caught in full flight.
Nor can I understand “Ade L’s” inability to
photograph the wedge-tail’s nest because of
the savageness of the resident. I have robbed
these eagles of their eggs and murdered their
young, and they have shown nothing beyond
a mild interest in the proceedings. They
always left the nest at my approach and
maintained a high altitude until I left.
* * * *
“Wandi”: “Dinkum” (B. 20/10/’27) may
blame black cockatoos for the chunks torn
out of small redgum-trees in the Maryborough
(Q.) district. To get at the grubs in guru’
and wattle trees, which they locate by listen-
ing, the cockatoos scoop off the bark and cut
thick branches right through. The great-
billed cockatoo has the most powerful bill,
1-Jin. long and 3in. deep. That of the western
black cockatoo is 2|in. deep. So powerful are
these and kindred beaks that they cut down
saplings 6in. thick and tear out pieces lOin.
long. There are seven varieties of “black
Australians.” but they don’t all go wood-
chopping after bardees, or chewed trees
would be much more common in the bush.
j|C *l*
“Bihai”: Between Hall Sound and Dis-
aster Bay (Papua) there ranges a strange
fish whose species has never been determined.
It was first reported by missionary Chalmers.
His description was of a huge fish which
appeared alongside the 10-ton cutter in
which he was travelling, and then dropped
astern and followed leisurely .for half an
hour. It was of a uniform dark-grey color
with a huge dorsal fin, and its size was such
that, as it appeared to him, were it to open
its mouth and come ahead it would have
engulfed the cutter as easily as the. Biblical
whale swallowed Jonah. The native crew
were unperturbed at its approach, saying:
“This fellow he no fight.” Many times since
it has been seen in the distance, but Arthur
Dallen, one of the “old-hand” fossickers, got
the surprise of his life when it had .a
“close-up” of the canoe in which he was
crossing Hall Sound. He gave a description
similar to that of Chalmers, and estimated
the length at 60. feet. Personally, I have
only seen the dorsal fin at some distance, but
it appeared to be as big as the jib of my
dinghy. Could this be a “killer” (Orca
gladiator) of abnormal size?
* * * *
“Werrimee”: A big cylinder-shaped water-
bag hung under the roof of Slocum’s veran-
dah. The top was open, and at the bottom
was a wooden tap. The water was delici-
ously cool, but I thought it had a peculiar
taste. Looking in at the top, I discovered
several cucumbers in the water, put there to
keep fresh and cool, and perched on them
were two large green frogs. When I drew
Slocum’s attention to the latter, he said:
“Yes; I’ve chucked ’em out several times,
but they always go back. The missus ain’t
pleased—she don’t like bobbin’ her hand
against ’em when she’s after a cucumber.”
* * * *
“Prop” : N. Q’land does not need the Eng-
lish skylark; it has a skylark of its own.
On hot still evenings this bird rises to a
great height, singing all the way. His day-
time flight, however, is lower because of the
sooty-liawk.
sic * * *
“Anaf”: A puzzling instance of canine
instinct is reported in the Lismore district
(N.S.W.). A man who had been the owner
of two cattle-dogs, devotedly attached to him,
died after a few days’ illness. Before liis
death the dogs tried repeatedly to get into
his room, and had to be tied up. When the
funeral left the house they were shut up, and
were not let out until the next day. Being
missed some hours later, they were found at
the dead man’s grave, seven miles away.
There were signs that they had been digging
at it energetically. The puzzle is how they
found their way to the cemetery. They
could not have followed a scent, their owner’s
body having been enclosed in the coffin, and
the mourners were all in cars.
IT MIGHT BE TRUE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
St. Peter stood at the Pearly Gate when a
ghost with a swag drew nigh,
And a dish, and a pick, and a waterbag,
and a hopeful gleam in his eye.
He knocked on the gate as he hitched his
load and said, “Now let me in,
For I’ve climbed np here from a far-off
land of sweat and sorrow and sin.”
St. Peter looked through the small trapdoor
and said, “Why, yes, my son;
But you’ll have to make a statement first,
and tell me what you’ve done.
No one gets in on the nod these days; we’ve
been badly taken down
By a lot of crooks whose hands were white
but whose souls were dirty brown.”
“Well, I tramped from Oodnadatta right up
to Tennant’s Creek
And blew the wash, month after month, till
I could scarcely speak.
The dust was thick, and the sun shone hot,
and whenever I’d breathe I’d choke,
And I searched for gold day after day till
my heart was nearly broke.
“I slewed off west on the Tauami track and
lived on native kai.
And water I got from mallee roots —without
the word of a lie.
Spinifex, sand and mulga scrub; pindan
and r id-hot stones,
And the dingoes howled round my camp ail
night in answer to my groans.
“And wild men followed me all the way;
they lived on snakes and rabbits,
And they ate each other's kidney fat and had
other unpleasant habits.
I reached the lodes; they were big and rich,
but I couldn’t get a show,
For companies had them all pegged off, so
my johnnie-cake was dough.
“Then away to wealthy Edie Creek among
the mountains tall,
But I got there just a bit too late; the Big
Six had it all.
So 1 tramped away on the mountain trails,
through bush, o’er streams and stones,
Till I walked right into a cannibal camp,
and there I left my bones.”
St. Peter bent a kindly eye and said “The
tale you tell
Is true enough, for we’ve had you watched
and you’ve fairly earned a spell.
And you did a good deal more than you say,
for you always stuck by a mate,
And some of your friends are up here now;
but I fear you’ve come too late.
FELICITATIONS.
“What-o, Bill! ’Ow y’ gettin’ on?”
“Prospectors are real good men on earth, but
here they make things hard ;
They muck up our streams infernally and
tear up roads by the yard.
They’re pegging out the Elysian fields and
sluicing dowm the rills
And delving up the gardens and liydraulic-
ing the hills.
“And they growl because it’s not in the
rough, and they can’t get on to a lead;
They laugh at the notices ‘Don’t dig here’
and say ‘Oh ! that be d’d !’
Whoever will rid us of the push can name
his price for guerdon.”
“Oh, ho!” said the spook, “just let me in
and I’ll rid you of your burden.”
The spook he made for the windlass shows
in the New Jerusalem,
And he met old mates by scores and said a
word or two to them.
And they struck their camps and rolled their
swags and made for the Pearly Gate,
And the newest comer hurried behind lest
lie should be too late.
St. Peter stopped the last man out and asked
him “What did you tell?”
“I told them all,” the other
said, “they are getting
rough gold in Hell.
And they’ll never stop till
they get right there, and
should it prove a duffer.
Then poor Old Nick must go
for his life, for they’ll
surely make him suffer. ’
“Pull up,” said the Saint;
“if ever a man has
earned house-room it’s
you.”
“Not on your life,” said the digger’s ghost,
“I reckon it might be true.”

EFFECT OF LIME ON SOILS.
"Burrum” : The danger of emphasising the
beneficial effects of lime on soils is that
many farmers may regard it as a universal
panacea, to the exclusion of other or arti-
ficial manures. If for no other reason, its
effect on the physical condition should make
it more commonly used. It has a binding
effect on soil particles and in a way cements
the coarse granules of some sandy soils,
thus giving that soil more body and a greater
water-retaining capacity. It may seem para-
doxical that the same action should give
an effect somewhat opposite on stiff clay
soils. In them it binds the very fine clay
particles into greater aggregates, with the
result that the soil, as a whole, is less
cohesive and freer to work. The Wimmera
black soils, though fine particled, are far
from cohesive, owing to the presence of lime
and humus. There is more air space in stiff
clays thus treated, and quite apart from the
chemical influence of lime the land becomes
more mellow.
The use of sulphate of lime (gypsum) is
often advocated. It has a beneficial physical
effect certainly, and I have heard it said
that “unless for the purpose of counteract-
ing acidity, gypsum is the best to use.”
But a soil does not need to show .a Bolshevik
reaction to be classed as acid. Acidity is
only comparative, and many of our sub-acid
soils need lime in its basic forms—carbonate
or hydrate. And many of them need it
urgently.
EXPERIMENTAL FARMS.
“Azac”: “Jack Point” (B. 6/10/’27), in
urging upon this country the adoption of
U.S.A. methods in connection with experi-
mental farms, displays a wealth of ignorance
on the subject. His advocacy of “little ex-
perimental farms in various districts to deal
with local aspects of agriculture as well as
soil analysis” is nonsense, as soil analysis
has been turned down by soil chemists, the
world over, for some years now. Two soils
may be exactly the same according to an
analysis, but one may be an ideal wheat soil
and the other quite useless. It is no good a
plant food being in the soil unless it is
available to plants, and a chemical analysis
does not show this.
The leaning of experts both here and in
U.S.A. is not in the direction of more ex-
perimental farms, but towards the appoint-
ment of more agricultural instructors (called
“county agents” in U.S.A.), whose duty
it is to live permanently in a district and
carry out experiments, in conjunction with
armors, on the farmers’ own properties.
We have experimental farms in most
N.S.W. districts at present, and about a
dozen agricultural instructors, whose work,
most farmers w 7 ill agree, is ten times more
valuable to them than all the experimental
farms put together.
The point is that the agricultural instruc-
tor lives in the district amongst the farmers
to whom he gives advice, and he has to
be very sure that his advice is good before
he gives it, seeing that he has to stay there
and take a knock should his advice be worth-
less.
HIGH-GRADE SUPER.
“A.Z.”: A lot of propaganda has been
undertaken in recent months to convince the
farmer that 17 per cent, soluble super, is
too soluble and likely to be leached out
of the soil by rain long before the crop has
had time to use it. But 22 per cent, soluble
super, has been making headway for all that,
and for a very good reason.
It requires only a slight understanding of
soil chemistry to dispel all misunderstanding
on the point. What happens when super, is
applied is that the first rains dissolve and
distribute it very widely throughout the soil,
each particle of soil taking up its share
of the fertiliser, which almost immediately
reverts from the soluble mono-calcium phos-
phate to the insoluble tri-calcium phos-
phate. Although this latter form is insoluble
•in water it is available, though perhaps
slowly, to plant roots. Examination of
drainage water from fields fertilised with
heavy dressings of super, have proved
beyond doubt that it does not leach out of
the soil. Moreover, it is not uncommon in
America and England for farmers to use up
to 40 per cent, soluble super., and the results
they obtain justify a repetition of the prac-
tice.
Should the farmer buy the higher grade
article he need only buy IGcwc. of 22 per
cent, soluble super, and add 4c-wt. of sand,
and he then has 20cwt. of 17 per cent,
soluble super., while paying for only 16cwt.
of the fertiliser.
Sometimes ground rock-pliosphate and
super, are purposely mixed, and this mixture,
in certain cases, has advantages in that it
runs more freely through the fertiliser
attachment than does pure super. In a
good year the yield from, the mixture would
probably be a little less than where super,
alone was used. In a dry season there would
be very little difference between the two,
what little difference there was being in
favor of the mixture of rock-phosphate and
super., because the slower supply of avail-
able phosphates to the plants, as given by
the mixture, would be an advantage in a
dry year. Moreover, the residual effects
would certainly be greater in the case of
the mixture.
THE DECREASED WHEAT YIELD.
“ Villers-Brett.”: “J.G.’s” comments on
decreased wheat yields (B. 13/10/’27) are
likely to give a false impression. Wheat
yields 50 years ago were no higher than they
are to-day on the same class of land. The
present-day farmer is not going to grow
wheat on land that will harvest 50 bushels
to the acre if he can put it to more profitable
use. Half a century ago most of the volcanic
soils in Victoria were devoted to wheat-
growing, and the necessity for fallowing was
unknown. This land to-day is worth up to
£5O an acre. Some of it much more. Allow-
ing it costs 3s. to produce a bushel of wheat
and the harvest is 40 bushels to the acre, is
it not more profitable to plant potatoes?
RATIONS OF SHOW STOCK.
“C.R.D.”: Recently visited the stud-farm
of a well-known pedigree beef-stock breeder.
His young hope in the year-old cow-husband
class is doing splendidly in his preparation
for next Sydney Easter Show. He should ;
he gets a small banquet every day, and is,
like a politician visiting England, acquiring
a patrician air and a mighty girth. To top
off his ration of hay and concentrates he is
given daily the following delicacies: Six
gallons of whole-milk rich as can be had,
two-dozen fresh eggs and a bottle of port.
That’s something like an egg-nog, and from
the way he soaks it up I’d hate to introduce
him to the boys at the longest bar south of
the Line—he looks as though he’d have a
spot for every foot of it!
A certain relative of his, an oversize in
cows, who made her debut and triumphant
progress last Royal Show, has had two calves
to date (she’s 5 or 6, I forget which)
but her daily issue comes direct per
squeeze-and-squirt from six hefty cows in
full milk.
ROTATO-GROWING IN QUEENSLAND.
“Leo Lear”: I have had personal experi-
ence of potato-growing in the Burnett (Q.),
so listen. The crop is a very risky one in
such a climate, and my advice to farmers
who can’t afford a failure is, leave it to
those who can. There are two sowing sea-
sons. First in August, the potatoes, if any,
being ready to dig in December. The crop
must be watched very carefully, as under
heat and moisture second growth is rapid.
If it sets in, uproot the field without delay.
Besides the usual plant diseases, which are
assisted by climatic conditions, insect pests
are bad. For the early crop, seed from
southern States is suitable, but expensive.
For the second venture in February, use the
small tubers from the first cron, if they
have not rotted in the interval. An early
frost will take any profit from sowing
number two. Yields at best are light, and do
not keep well even when bagged from the
sun’s rays immediately as dug.
KILLING TIMBER.
“Bad Australian” : The method of killing
timber recommended by “Furphy” (B.
6/10/’27) is all right as far as the killing
is concerned, but it practically amounts to
grubbing and burning out, and the cost
would be prohibitive except where the land
was required for immediate cultivation.
Any white, grey or yellow box or ironbark
will burn right out, roots included, if it is
first sapped all around the base for about
nine inches below ground level. Poor burning
timber, such as messmate, peppermint and
white gum. can also be burned out by using
“Furphy’s” method and firing for a feiv
hours longer.
The best and cheapest way to kill timber
is to take a strip of bark about a foot wide
off all around the tree. If this is done when
the sap is running, and the bark comes off
easily and cleanly, it usually makes a good
job. A man could do an acre of barking in
average forest in about the same time
as it would take him to sap and fire one
big tree. If a tree is chipped all around
through bark and sap to the red w 7 ood it
waits much quicker than when it is barked,
but on account of the sudden check to the
sap this method often results in a dead tree
above the girdling and a fine healthy crop of
sucker below.
HOW BUSH-FIRES START.
“P.M.” : I have put in a good few years in
timbered country, and seen a great many
thousand acres burnt, and the longer I live
the surer I am that the fires don’t light them-
selves. To prove it, of course, is quite a differ-
ent matter. The habitual fire-lighter is too
cunning. A favorite dodge is to spread
kerosene soaked in straw in a suitable place,
and stand a lighted candle in the centre of
it. By the time the candle has burned down
and set the paddock ablaze, the perpe-
trator of this method of scrub-clearing is
miles away at the pub, creating an alibi.
FAKED DAIRY RECORDS
“Azac”: The making of another world’s
record, this time by a Jersey cow at Haw-
kesbury Agricultural College, incites me to
be cynical regarding production records in
general. This Jersey—by name Wagga
Gladys—is said to have yielded 20,8351 b.
milk, testing 5.52 per cent., in 3G5 days.
This would equal about 11501 b. butter-fat,
from which could be made 13851 b. commercial
butter —about 41b. per day. Now I ven-
ture to say the commercial return from
Wagga Gladys was not one-quarter of that
from ordinary cows yielding from 2001 b. to
4001 b. butter-fat per year.
The figures claimed as records are not the
actual yields, but merely computed yields.
The cow 7 is prepared by special feeding for
the official testing-day, which comes only
once a month. The result of this official
day’s testing is then multiplied by the
number of days in the month, and that
theoretical figure is entered up as the cow’s
yield for the month. In actual fact it would '
be anything up to 50 per cent, above her
actual production for the month.
For about a week prior to each testing-
day the cow is fed on concentrates of the
highest milk-producing properties. Nothing
short of milk itself is barred during the
week’s “cramming” of the cow in preparation
for the day’s testing. The practice of feed-
ing milk itself is considered dishonorable,
but it requires a keen sense of discernment
to call such a practice dishonorable, and let
go unchallenged the 'feeding of such highly
concentrated milk-producing fodders as are
now fed prior to testing.
Only when records are established under
conditions of feeding and management that
are commercially practicable w 7 ill they be
be of any real value to the dairying industry.
THE DRAFT ON WOOL.
“Meum et Tuum” : “Lath” (B. 6/10/’27)
further asks us to believe that wool coming
from Western N. S. Wales and Queensland
will lose weight on being stored in the humid
coastal climate. Both wrnol and wheat gain
w 7 eight during a sea voyage. Wool in pre-
w 7 ar days gained enough weight during a trip
to London to pay the freight. Wool stored
at either Sydney or Brisbane would gain
weight, on account of proximity to the sea.
The draft pound of wool that the growers
are allowing the buyers is costing them, on
the present clip, £506,250. It is too much
to give aw 7 ay.
Another advantage the buyer has is that
should he bid for a line of wool and it is
knocked down to him, and he discovers a
line later on perhaps a penny cheaper, he
cau have his first bid rescinded, and the
unlucky owner of the wool has it re-offered
at the end of the sales, probably to his dis-
advantage.
DEAR LAND AND OVERSTOCKING.
“T..T.”: Throughout a large portion of
N.S.W. remarkably high prices are ruling
for pastoral properties. Perhaps these prices
are justified by economic circumstances, but
high prices for grazing land frequently mean
overstocking. Overstocking in turn means
that heavy losses result every time a dry
spell occurs. And dry spells are amazingly
frequent in the best grazing country. The
1927 drought in N.S.W. (now partly
broken) would never have resulted in such
severe losses as occurred if it had not been
for the fact that most stations were much
overstocked.
To some extent this overstocking can be
regarded as the result of a series of good
years and a crippled export trade, but to
some extent also it was due to the high
prices paid for land. Having paid a high
price for his land the buyer sets out to get
a good return for the money invested. This
means double lambings in the year and
greater risks generally. In some cases heavy
stocking is partly counteracted by an
increase in carrying capacity due to improve-
meats, but the tendency is a dangerous one.
The pastoral industry has been always too
much of a gamble, and the stakes are now
heavier than ever.
SHEEP RAILED 4000 MILES.
“B.”: What is claimed as a record in
sheep transportation by rail has just been
accomplished by J. B. Howe, of Murgha
station, Deniliquin, and W. Bright, of Koo-
kynie (W.A.). With a splendid season in
W.A. and a poor one in the Eastern States,
it was decided to rail 3000 2-tooth ewes and
80 rams across the continent, 4000 miles.
They were mustered from grazing areas at
Moulamein and Swan Hill and packed into a
special train at Bendigo. Travelling to Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Kalgoorlie, they were
finally dealt with by the W.A. railways and
landed at Kookynie, 120 miles north of Kal-
goorlie, in good condition, 4000 miles from
their original home. The journey took six
days. There were 21 deaths, attributable to
dipping prior to leaving. The cost of the
special was £l5OO, or something under 10s.
a head. Frequent changes of trucks, neces-
sary on account of varying gauges, and care-
ful supervision by their owners were import-
ant factors in the success of the experiment.
AUSTRALIAN MERINO DEFENDED.
“Trepex”: The remarks of a university
professor concerning our wool, reported by
“FY7” (B. 29/9/’27), aren’t worth getting
excited over. He said something about
doubting the purity of the Australian merino.
What does that matter, when we know that
our merino or crossbred or whatever they
like to call him is a better wealth-producer
than any other sheep in the world. If Brad-
ford folk or any other textile people want
to influence our woolgrowers, they do not
need to cable us theoretical utterances; all
they have to do is to cable out an increase
in their quotations for fine wools. That
is the only thing that it would be worth our
while to notice, but that is the thing
they will not do. Until then, let us leave the
70’s and 80’s counts alone; we had better
stick to the 64’s with a bit of the GO’s run-
ning through them. But no lower! I draw 7
the line at these so-called 58’s merinos which
are poorer stuff than any comeback.
I cannot understand anyone disparaging
the quality of our wool in the face of the
current clip in N.S.W. In a catalogue I
have just valued there were more 70’s than
64’s; some easily findable 80’s and a few
90’s. The 100’s count is the highest recog-
nised commercial quality of wool, and there
is a very small world’s production of that;
but a clever sorter would probably find some
in the wool I handled to-day. It is beauti-
ful stuff and I like to handle it, but I am
sorry to see it just the same, for it means a
loss of fleece weight off the sheep. Coarser
wools for bigger profits, say I, in the pre-
sent condition of the textile trade, but I
am not fool enough to want the policy car-
ried to an extreme.
A friend of mine has just brought back
some wool samples from South Africa. In
quality, style and breeding, they are a laugh-
able contrast to N.S.W. wool. I am not
saying that good wool cannot be grown in
South Africa, but I do want to prevent our
growers being enticed away from the best
sheep in the world by a theoretical scare.
CO-OPERATION FOR TOMATO-
GROWERS.
“XSA”: When “B. Fair” (B. 13/10/’27)
quoted the two factory prices for tomatoes,
£8 and £5 per ton, he omitted to state that
quality accounts for the variation. In the
Bathurst district the smaller price obtains,
simply because for pulping purposes the
product does not compare with that produced
in the £8 localities. In no circumstances will
the growers there succeed in obtaining prices
equivalent to those in some other districts
I know 7 . The hope certainly lies in complete
organisation of all tomato-growers in
N. S. Wales, and this is very nearly an
accomplished fact. The Hawkesbury River
growers, who have planted 1000 acres this
year, hope to put 6000 tons through their
own pulping plant next year. N.S.W. fac-
tories demand the best fruit for treatment,
w r hereas in Vic. second-grade fruit is ac-
cepted. If the Marketing Act can be amended
so that inter-State contracts can be declared
null and void there need be no price-cutting.
But what a scoop for the profiteer until this
is done! “B. Fair” forgot to mention that
the existing contracts he refers to are in the
State of N.S.W. only, and that’s the rub.
SPRAYING FRUIT TREES.
“Larrapinta”: “H.M.'s” article (B.
13/10/’27) on fighting codlin-moth is timely
and correct, but there is one point he didn’t
mention, namely, poisoning bees with mix-
tures containing arsenic. All authorities
agree that it is only a waste of time and
material to spray too early, but often,
through press of w r ork or the approach of
wet weather, an orcliardist will spray before
the blossoms have finished shedding their
petals. The result is that bees in near-by
hives are killed, while the arsenic destroys
(Con tinued on page 31.)

the fertilising power of the pollen, and so
injures the delicate stamens and pistils in
the flowers that the fruit which sets is poor
in quality and quantity. Leaving aside the
fact that this early spraying may cause
serious loss to any men who keep bees for
a living in the neighborhood, no orchardist
can afford to be without bees at blossom -
time, as many men have found to their sor-
row. The correct time to spray for codlin-
motli is, as “H.M.” says, about five days
after the petals have fallen from the trees.
Not only does it obviate any risk of killing
off the orchardists’ best friend —the bee
but it is then most effective for preventing
the attack of the codlin-motli.
PROPAGATING FROM BUDS.
“W.N.F.”: “Yabbie” (B. 20/10/’27) com-
plained that many buds taken from one
grapefruit-tree produced many, varying types
of fruit. That arises from lack of breeding
in the tree from which the buds were taken.
The same thing applies to all lines of pro-
pagation. The progeny of a badly-bred ani-
mal or tree of any kind always lacks uni-
formity.
In handling trees there are two ways of
overcoming the trouble. One is by adopting
the method of Luther Burbank, whose slogan
was “Repetition, repetition, repetition.” The
other way is by very careful selection. They
come to much the same thing, but the forme.r
is more the way of the man who has facili-
ties for handling great numbers of stocks,
tlie latter the plan of one who is working
carefully on small lots.
If “Yabbie” selects a few of the best type
of trees that he has and uses buds only
from them, then takes the best of those and
repeats the process over and over again, in
perhaps 20 years or so, if he is fitted for
the work, he will either have much improved
grape-fruit or attained a more or less fixed
type, whichever he is seeking to do.
If he is to attain success in either direc-
tion it will be necessary for him not only
to select the trees from which he takes his
buds but also to see that the trees are well
nourished. As he will be propagating from
buds and not from seed, he will not need to
pay any attention to fertilisation of the
blooms, and to that extent his work is simpli-
fied. But he will still find plenty to occupy
his time and attention in taking full and
complete records of the robustness, or other-
wise, of the trees, as well as the shape, size,
color, quality and quantity of fruit produced
by the trees under observation from which to
select buds.
DRY FRUIT SPRAYS.
“Ibis”: Interesting experiments are being
carried out by fruitgrowers and vigncrons in
the use of “cloud form” dusts for the control
of insect and fungoid pests. The advantages
of the dusting method over the usual wet
spray are that no costly spraying machinery
is needed, and that the dusts, being ready
mixed for use, save time and labor in mixing.
The quickness of application, too, lessens
labor costs. With insects such as peach
aphis, thrip, red mite, etc., satisfactory
controls have been established with the dust-
blower, whilst in U.S.A. it is claimed that
certain arsenate dusts are 40 per cent, more
effective than wet spray for codlin-motli in
apples. But whether the dusts will beat the
wet sprays as fungus controls is an open
questioti, though the dusts, being usually
manufactured in a very fine form, are able
to penetrate to every nook and cranny of the
plant and are fairly adhesive.
WHERE ARE THE GOOD NAGS?
“Jim Domino”: “N.M.L.” (B. 13/10/’27)
is right about the weedy mare being put to
the stud while the good sort does the graft
on the station. By culling undersized foals,
owners would ultimately reap the benefit.
“N.M.L.” makes a bloomer, however, in
directing “Spike” to go to the back country
of Queensland to see horses that are horses.
I have heard that very same advice given in
N.-W. Q. about N.S'.W. On one occasion
in N.S.W. I helped take delivery of 350
head of Queensland nags just off the road.
The top price was £l4, the lowest £l, when
sold three weeks later. There were good
hacks among them, but a lot of them
were just plain cuddy. Queensland certainly
has some wonderful stock-horses, but around
Moree (N.S.W.) there are plenty of good
cattle-drafting prads. And the horses bred
out near Parkes, Forbes, Condobolin, Nyn-
gan and Bourke in N.S.W. are a pretty fair
lot on the average.
I know this much: that a good picnic
racer in Western and North-Western N.S.W.
if taken to Queensland can usually clean up
a good few meetings in the country. And
once a picnicker is known to come from the
South there are always buyers. A favorite
dodge of drovers (I know, because I’ve
played the game) is to buy some cheap,
likely-looking jumpers in the North, and
school them in spell periods during the trek
south. Then the nags are sold to N.S.W.
buyers “because they can jump, and come
from Queensland.” The drover then buys
a N.S.W.-bred galloper, as cheap as he can,
and after winning several matches on the
way, sells out in Q. and gets a good price
because th e horse can gallop well and comes
from N.S.W. “N.M.L.” suggests that
“Spike” can find real horses in Q. “away
from the fenced areas, out of sound of a
telephone bell, and beyond the fumes of
petrol.” All I can possibly say to that is
that poor old “Spike” would have a long
search. I rode out-back boundary fences
in a tin Lizzie less than two years ago, and
it’s a poor Q. station that hasn’t a ’phone.
FOUL BROOD IN BEES.
“Orn”: “Larrapinta’s” remarks on foul
brood in bees (B. 22/9/’27) call for com-
ment on two points. The new hive should not
at first be furnished with “sheets” of foun-
dation, but with very small strips, the object
being to compel the bees to use up all the
infected honey they have brought from the
old hive in their tummies in the production
of wax. and not to have any to store. The
honey is the main, possibly the sole, means
of conveying the germs.
Secondly, there is no need whatever to
burn the hive. Treatment with boiling water
with some caustic-soda or carbolic in it is
regarded as sufficient by the best authorities.
If the hive is an old kero.- or gin-case, by
all means burn it, but the sacrifice is quite
superfluous with a modern frame hive. The
writer does not even burn his frames, but
scrapes them clean and boils them. Inci-
dentally, two of his hives slightly infected
appear to have recovered, showing that it
isn't advisable to adopt rigid rules.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Bill R.”: Where a rabbit-proof fence
crosses a watercourse, swinging sections of
bverlapped wire-netting suspended from a
wire strained overhead are preferable to cum-
bersome flood gates. The latter, when pushed
open by flood waters, invariably are held ajar
by debris lodged against the uprights, and
there the rabbits find an entrance when the
water subsides. But the swinging fence of
loose netting floats out on the flood, allow-
ing a passage to all rubbish washed down,
and sinks back to its place as the flood
lowers. The hanging netting should be two
feet longer than is required to reach the
ground, and may be weighted down with
loose stones while the watercourse is dry.
“J.G.” : Many fruit-trees are ruined when-
ever there is a heavy crop of fruit through
the limbs breaking off or splitting down from
the trunk. The best way to support heavily-
laden limbs is to get a good stout sapling
about as long as the tree is high. To this
pole attach a number of ropes or pieces of
fencing-wire of about No. (5 gauge. These
ropes or wires are attached maypole or
umbrella fashion, and each rope or wire is
fixed to a separate limb. This will keep the
limbs or branches from breaking or splitting
at the trunk, whilst the limbs have nothing
to chafe against in windy weather.
“Villers-Brett.”: Land-owners in districts
of high rainfall might do worse than plant
a few fig-trees in the grazing paddocks. At
Pinjarrah, south of Perth, one grazier has
20 acres under figs. The figs fall when
ripe, and sheep and pigs are turned in. One
tree is calculated to fatten two sheep, and
90 trees to the acre are planted. The trees
have a long life, and no cultivation is neces-
sary when established.
“Silentio”: One of the best and least-
known cures for cows blown on lucerne is
a couple of tablespoonfuls of kerosene in a
pint of new milk. It is easily given in a
bottle when the cow is bailed up.
“Hornby”: To cure impaction in sheep,
caused by scrub fodder, feed once a week
a ration of Epsom salts per medium of
boiled maize, mixing the salts in the water
before putting the maize in to boil, and
using a dozen packets of salts to a kerosene-
tin of water. To avoid waste, feed the
maize in troughs or improvise bag-feeders.
To neutralise any fevering tendency put in
i'lb. eream-of-tartar to each tin of water.
If the sheep show a disinclination to eat
the maize, keep them off the scrub till they
are hungry.
“Hornby” : To teach a dog not to pick up
scraps away from the house or camp, thus
ensuring him against being poisoned, take
him out as soon as he is able to follow. Get
some small pieces of meat, make an incision
in each, liberally sprinkle with cayenne-
pepper and close up. Taking care that tin 1
dog does not follow, go for a short walk and
drop the pieces at intervals. Then go back,
get the pup and take him over the same
route. He will pick up and eat one or two
of the pieces, and will get a lesson he will
never forget. Mustard is used instead of
cayenne by many bushmen, but hasn’t proved
as successful.
“Hornby”: To cure a rearing horse, take
a slightly cracked bottle full of water hot
enough to be decidedly distressing but not
seriously injurious. Immediately the ani-
mal rears hit him on the top of the head
hard enough to break the bottle, which,
being cracked, will break fairly easily. The
combined effect of the blow, the falling glass
and the unpleasantly hot dousing will cure
the animal of any desire to rear again.
“Hop Scrub”: Research workers in IT.S.
have established the fact that the best codlin-
motli spray is made up of 31b. arsenate of
lead. 1A gallons of any light mixable oil.
calcium caseinate (as a spreader) and 100
gallons water. A power outfit capable of
maintaining 2501 b. pressure and fitted with
an efficient agitator is essential for a good
“mopping up.” There are at least half a
dozen Australian makes that fulfil require-
ments.
“Bill R.” : A sure way to rid the place of
rats is to lightly sprinkle their runs with
caustic soda. For a few days no result will
be apparent. Then the rodent will dis-
appear. And the tale of how their feet
burned must be handed down from genera-
tion to generation, for never have I known
rats to return to premises so treated.
“H.M.”: There would be less disease in
poultry if the soil in the runs was dug over
at least once a fortnight. The droppings of
poultry are heavily charged with organic
matter, and if left to be trodden down by
the birds make the ground a breeding-place
for disease. To dig the soil over, too, gives
the hens a chance to make holes for their
dust-batlis.
“A. 8.” : Keep a tin of kerosene near by
when using seccateurs, pruning-knife or saw,
and, after treating each tree, dip the tools
into it and wipe with a rag saturated with
olive-oil. It may seem laborious, but it is
the best way to avoid disease among trees.
Kerosene and olive-oil, if plastered on apple-
aphis, will cleanse the tree of the disease.
* * * *
“Chinta”: The introduction into Australia
of the cattle-tick is often attributed to the
cable staff of Darwin, who in 1872 imported
a number of Brahma cattle from Batavia.
But .years previous to that numbers of buf-
falo were imported from Java by the settlers
and garrison at Port Essington, N.T. When
this settlement was abandoned in 1849 there
were several buffalo herds in existence, all
probably carrying the tick. A few years later
the barque Florence Street, chartered to
bring a cargo of buffaloes to Sydney to sup-
ply an exceptional demand for meat on the
diggings, was caught in a typhoon and driven
ashore in Cambridge Gulf. Most of r the
beasts were drowned, but a few managed lo
reach the shore and establish themselves.
These were the forerunners of the enormous
buffalo herds which in 1895 were estimated
to number 160.000. Since then hide-hunters
have taken toll at the rate of 2000 monthly
for some years, and at present the water-
buffalo isn’t very prevalent.

MAOESS.
THE AIR MALE.
“Beware ! I have warned you ! But when
you see your Folly, drop a rope off the Air-
ship and I will save you if J can !”
Fred Fearless spoke the word with Bitter-
ness. His heart was full of toreher. The
lovely, spoilt Maud Danvers, he knew, de-
spised him as a mere dark, but he Alone
knew the Villans with whom she had to
deal. He Alone knew that when they in-
duced her to travel by the privete Air-ship
instead of the Air Male in which her father
was to travel there was some Dirty Work.
As the Air-ship rose from the ground lie
lept into a handy car, much to the Annoy-
ance of its owner, and set off full-Tare in
Pursuet of the Air-ship’s coarse. Perhaps, he
thought, she would discover her folly before
it was Too late.
And he was Right. Sudenly, watching
the plane through a telescope, he saw a rope
fall over the side. Alas! it did not reach
nearly to the Ground.
Our Hero did not hesitate a moment. He
saw the aeroplane would pass over a lofty
mountain which Up Paired in the distant.
At breakneck speed, causing the car to lean
over Pocks and Streams, he made for the
cressed.
He was only Just in Time. The car
reached the Hilltop and crashed over the pre-
cipice on the other side. But Our Hero was
not in it! No! with lightning Agilitty he
had seized the rope, which just touched the
mountain top, and there he was now r whirl-
ing in Mid Air, trying to climb up the rope.
It was Indeed a Dauntless deed. At any
moment the desprite Yillans might cut the
rope and hurl him into Eternity, now a thou-
sand feet below him.
In the meantime the Villans had un-
masked and the Terrerfied Girl saw the true
nature of their Evil designes.
“Aha, Maud Danvers, you are mine!’
croaked Felix Fiddlesticks, twirling his long
black moustaches. “You thought me your
father’s friend; but I hate him! Hate him,
I say! I hate him because he is good and
noble and I have lost my money backing
Horses. But he is going to Die. I have
made an invention by which another plane
will spray powdered explosive on the first
Bank of Clouds we meet. The Air Male
which • is following us will enter it after we
have passed through. Then, with an electric
ray, I will explode the cloud and the Air
Male will go down in Flames. Your father
will be No More; and I will have all his
money, and I will marry you.”
“Oh spare him! Spare him!” cried the
afrighted girl. But he was Adament.
“Peitro here is a priest who will marry
us. He has to do anything I tell him
because I know that once when he was
young and poor he Forged his Father’s Will.
I will give you half an hour to make up your
mind to marry me.”
In his triumph he had not noticed that the
girl, with a thought of how she had mis-
juged the poor young dark, had thrown
the rope over the side of the Air-ship’s cock-
pit. She tried to keep him occupied by Con-
versation ; but at last he grew impatient.
“Come; time is up. You must be mine,”
he said seizing the girl.
“Unhand her, Villan !” cried the voice of
Our Hero. Fred Fearless, leaping into the
cockpit. He held a revolver in his hand, and,
Baffled, Felix Fiddlesticks held his hands
up. So did the evil priest.
“But you cannot save the Air Male and
her father,” he vaunted. “See, there ahead is
that bank of cloud. The other aeroplane you
see is spraying the explosive. Behind us
see the Big Air Male, following us, rushing
to its fate!”
It was even as he said. Rushing along
at 100 miles an hour, they would be in
the cloud immedjately. Fred saw that not
a moment was to be lost. Taking Maud in
his arms he climbed to the side, and jumped
upward.
Few T men. would have had the Courage
for that Deed. But Our Hero’s judgement
was not at Fault. So great v. as the speed
at which the Air-ships were travelling that,
SOMETHING YOU COULDN’T
FORGIVE.
“Nup! He’s a waster! He not only got
away with my wife, but he took my
car, too.”
“Oh, goodness! Not the new car, I hope?”
before Our Hero and his fare burden started
to come down from their leap, the Air Male
was beneath them. Seizing the ropes around
its monster balloon Our Hero, eumberd
as he was by Maud, clambered down into the
carriage of the Air Male.
In another moment, the C-aptin, warned
of the danger, turned his Monster Vessel to
the left. Even as he did so the Cloud
exploded with a roar, and the Air-ship of
the Yillan, who had misjuged his arrange-
ments, crashed downwards, a mass of flames.
The passengers, when r they realised how
they had been saved, cheered Our Hero, as
Maud’s father, taking his hand, made him a
Partner in his business.

“Mulgo”: Farmers, especially the cow-

and went to bed too early in the evening for

The Deed.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Eternal City was built upon seven
hills; Hooper’s Flat is built upon
seventeen, or eighteen if you count
the small rise upon which Billing’s cottage
stands. The flat, from which the place is
named, is about two acres in extent and con-
tains venerable ruins. The blacksmith’s
shop has lurched some distance from the
perpendicular and is kept from falling by a
number of saplings and a decayed tank.
Cogan’s cows sometimes shelter there, and
there are sheepskins hanging from the
rafters, but no sound of hammer or roar of
bellows is ever heard within. Thirty yards
away there is a chimney standing amid the
wreckage left by fire —sheets of rusted and
blackened iron and charred ends of timber.
This, in days not so very remote, was the
Oriental Hotel —a house not unknown to
travellers from far cities. Its lower-grade
rival, merely described as Carson’s pub, still
remains on the slope of a near hill. Only
one building in active use is found on the
flat itself. This is the general store, other-
wise known as “Fletcher’s Emporium”—a
large place with four broad windows and two
main doors.
Carson’s pub and Fletcher’s store are the
two intellectual centres for the dwellers on
the seventeen hills. The quarter of a mile
between them undulates through red dust
and is bordered by thickets of stringy-bark
saplings. To find the way to Billing’s yon
must go up the hill from the store and take
the first turning to the left.
But it is so extremely improbable that any-
body who does not know the way to Billing’s
would ever want to find it that the mere
fact of a stranger making inquiries at the
pub caused that establishment to flutter and
stir in a most unusual manner. Mrs. Carson,
her daughter, the man who cleaned the yard
and four persons engaged in an argument
in the bar all came out into the road and
directed the traveller.
The inquirer had a Ford car and a hard,
red face. He looked as if he had been
travelling against a hot head-wind for several
months; but he drank beer fluently, and
beyond his request for information said
nothing. They saw him turn down the
Billing track towards the extra small hill
which is not counted in the seventeen and
return fifteen minutes later. They also
saw that he turned his car in the direction
of the flat and raised a good deal of dust
between himself and the rest of the beer he
might have been expected to drink.
It was Mrs. Billing who, with one child
in her arms and another at her knee, took
the letter from the visitor. Billing was
working at the back, and when a shrill coo-ee
brought him to the house he fingered the
document doubtfully. Still more doubtfully
he looked at it; then, with a kind of low
growl, he turned to his wife.
“You read what it says?”
“Course I read it.”
■ “Damn it. Why don’t you say something?”
“I got a clean shirt for you.”
The man growled again and turned away.
“No matter what a bloke does it don’t make
no matter.”
“You ain’t done nothing yet.”
“Aw, go an’ read a book!”
“If I was a man I wouldn’t wait for things
to come to me. I’d get out after them.”
One of the children was yelling as he
strode down the track. There was something
fiercely determined in the set of his shoulders,
and his hand clenched and unclenched as he
walked.
“It’s him and me for it,” he growled again.
“There won’t be much of that bloke left when
I've done with him.”
Where the track joined the dusty, red
road he paused irresolutely. He looked
towards Carson’s and frowned; then he
looked towards Fletcher’s and hunched his
shoulders.
“Only him and me. I’ll spread that bloke
out all right.”
He turned heavily and went up the hill
to the pub.
“What’s doin’, ’Ector?” asked the publican.
“Aw, nothin’. A mug of beer.”
“You’re off early, Mr. Billing,” said Mrs.
Carson. “Got some bad news or something?”
“Aw, nothin’,” he said.
He went past Fletcher’s and left both the
flat and the seventeen hills far behind him.
The evening began to gather towards dusk.
Gold lay on the tops of the distant trees,
but the shadow of the nearer slopes fell
along the track. His hands were clenched
all the time now and the frowm never left
his face.
“Hell!” he muttered. “Only him and me.
By gosh, I’ll kill that bloke.”
Darkness found him still tramping on.
Once he put his hand on his hip pocket and
once he shook a clenched fist at a fencing
post. Through the gloom came the far-off
whistle of the train on the branch line.
“By gosh,” he said and quickened his
steps.
Back at the little hill that was never
counted in the seventeen. Mrs. Billing had
put the children to bed and sar sewing by a
candle flicker. It was a very uneven flicker,
for the moths came thickly around in the
heavy air.
lf Him and his cursing and swearing and
doing nothing about it,” she said.
The flop of a larger moth put the candle
out altogether. She did not re-liglit it, but
thrust her sewing hastily aside and went out
to the verandah.
The rough post was cool against her
cheek. She leaned there and looked far out
over the garden and the paddock. The thick
throaty hiss of a young mopoke made her
start.
“Them things is always frightening me.”
she said. “Him and his cursing and swear-
ing!”
A child whimpered in slumber. She came
in and shut the door. In the lightless room
the darkness was intense.
“Anyway, I give him a clean shirt for it,”
she said.
At nine o’clock next morning they were
talking about the murder in Carson’s bar.
A man had been done to death at Birket’s
Crossing under the most dreadful circum-
stances, and Birket’s Crossing was only
eleven miles distant from Hooper’s Flat.
“It’s them motor-cars,” said long Bill
Harris, who had once been a blacksmith's
striker and still maintained his hate for the
thing which had forced him to change his
occupation. “Nobody ain't safe nowadays.
Nobody don’t know what sort of bloke he’s
talking to. They’re here this morning and
before night they’re hundreds of miles away.
THE SUFFERER.
“What a lovely wrap she’s wearing, Jim. But I do feel sorry for the poor animal that
was skinned for it.”
“ Thanks — that’s very kind of you, Mabel
Hard doers some of them —kill a man for his
bootlaces, they would, some of them.”
“My oath, they’re hard doers all right.
Remember that cove come here yesterday
looking for ’Ector Billing?”
The speaker went to the bar door aud
looked out on the hot morning. Mrs. Carson
spoke shrilly from behind the bar.
“He had a hard face. I took special note
of him. ‘That’s a bad man,’ I said to myself.
Hector Billing was in afterwards. He never
says much, but it was easy to see there was
something on his mind.”
“Hector Billing,” said Long Bill, “is a
harmless sort of bloke. There ain’t nothing
to be said against him.”
“That’s right,” said Mrs. Carson. “He
may not talk much, but there’s many a heap
worse than him.”
“The cove that done this murder might be
away near Sydney by this time,” said Bill.
“It’s them cars. Nobody ain’t safe.”
“It’s the wnrst thing we’ve had in this
district,” said Mrs. Carson, “battered fright-
ful, they say he was.”
Old Tom Johnson was driving four cows
through a gateway when Bert Read called
to him from the road.
“Heard about the murder, Tom?”
The old man looked up.
“It might rain before the week-end,” he
said in the soft voice of the deaf.
“Heard about the murder?”
“Eh? At Carson’s did you say? What
about Carson’s?”
His hand was cupped at his ear and he
came nearer to the man on horseback.
“Heard about the murder?”
“Murder,” murmured the veteran, catching
the word for the first time. “Murder at
Carson’s. Who done that?”
"No, no, not at Carson’s. Down at Bir-
ket’s Crossing—last night it was.”
“Carson murdered,” said the deaf .man
softly. “Well, well, well—you never know.”
On the little hill that was too small to be
numbered among the seventeen Mrs. Billing
was hanging out small garments on a clothes-
line. Her mouth was full of clotlies-pegs and
every few moments she paused to gaze at the
track. The smaller child was asleep in a
box on the verandah, the larger one was sit-
ting happily in the dust nursing the rem-
nants of what had once been a doll.
“He might have done it,” said the woman
as she took the last clothes-peg from her
mouth. “He might have done it, but it’s
more likely he’s drunk at Carson’s.”
She went inside, issuing shrill orders to
the child in the dust to follow. The little
one hugged her doll and remained seated.
“Vi’let, come here this minute. You’re
stubborn like your father, you are. Come in
away from them snakes, or I’ll teach you.”
Inside the cottage there were many things
to do, but the woman’s mind did not appear
to be on her work. A dozen times she
went to the door and looked out.
“Strange,” she said, “he’s very late. He
never did this before.”
She turned to the clock above the dresser,
looked at it doubtfully and then shook it,
as if to force from it the truth. She was
not sure of the time it told, but it had not
stopped since yesterday and it had seemed all
right then.
“Yi’let, you sit down by your sister and
speak to her if she wakes up. Don’t you
go leaving her, or I’ll teach you.”
She rolled her apron to the corner in such
a manner that it appeared triangular in form
and walked to the sliprails. There was no
mistake about the intentness of her gaze as
she watched the track. After ten minutes
she walked back very slowly towards the
house, pausing every few steps to look and
listen.
“He should be here,” she said gravely;
“something must have happened.”
Another glance at the clock when she
entered the kitchen seemed to fill her with
consternation. ,
“Yi’let,” she shouted, “don’t you dare to
move.”
This time she showed her anxiety by her
haste as she made for the sliprails. A faint
sound caught her ears and her face bright-
ened. In a moment she was out in the track,
her hands resting on her hips and her mouth
smiling.
The baker stopped his motor-van.
“Nice time to get here,’’ she cried in a
voice that held no reproach, “I had almost
given you up. A white and ’art a brown,
please.”
“Terrible about this murder,” said the
baker.
“Murder!” she said. “Where? Who done
it?”
The baker volubly poured forth the tale.
“That’ll show you,” she said. What it
would show she did not explain.
As she came down the path with the
loaves clasped to her bosom all her trouble
seemed to have vanished. Near the house
she turned and looked back.
“He might have done it,” she said, “but
more likely lie’s drunk at Carson’s.”
The baby wakened with a yell and the
elder child was scolded for no evident offence
until it also cried. The howling duet was
punctuated by some slapping and many
sharp words. By the time a sobbing peace
had been secured the woman was red in
the face and very hot.
A heavy step sounded on the verandah.
“Oh, it’s you,” she sqid without turning
her head.
“I done it,” he said thickly. “Give us a
drink.”
“It was up to you,” she grumbled.
“There’s water in the bucket.”
The man wiped the perspiration from his
face and dipped a pannikin into the water.
He drank eagerly.
“There was only him and me for it. I
killed him good.”
“Who are you talking about?”
“I don’ know his name. There was only
him and me.”
“Talk sense,” she said. “What did you
kill? Who did you kill?’
His laugh rang out loud and hearty.
“I killed him good,” he said.
She came close to him and looked into
his face. Her eyes were wide and her hand
clenched.
“Have you taken to murder?” she asked.
Her voice dropped on the terrible word.
The baker’s story came back to her with
horror.
“Who’s talkin’ about murder?” he said.
“There was only him and me and I had to
do for him.”
“Don’t keep saying the same Wing. Tell
me what you did.” She stepped back from
him pressing her hands to her breast.
“It was me or him.”
“The baker says he was broke up hor-
rible.”
Her voice had dropped almost to a whis-
per.
He laughed again.
“They was all there—all the Bombadelia
Shire Council.”
“Did they see you do it?”
He gave her a puzzled look.
“They asked us both all the questions
they knoo. It was when I told them all the
work of the sort I had done over Adelaide
side that I fair laid him out. There was
only the two of us in it. I knoo I had him
done when they asked about them there
water-tables. The noo engineer asked that—
a hard-lookin’ cove —oh, a hard-lookin’ cove!
—but he knoo. It fair killed him when I
said what I been used to doin’.”
“You don’t mean killed him dead?”
“Killed his charnce as dead as a lame
’orse. I got the road job. Six quid a week
an’ overtime in bad weather.”
“You got the job.” *
She came near to him and put her hands
on his shoulders.
“Now ain’t that good-oh, ’Ector?”
“I done it,” he said triumphantly.
“Well, anyhow, I got you a clean shirt,”
she said.

Information Sought.
A young bull calf has a mass of warts on
his head. Can these be cured? —l922.
They may be of parasitic origin. Paint
the affected area with glacial acetic acid.
Take care that the acid does not get into
the animal’s eyes.
Do the rules as to spacing, position of pen-
name, etc., in pars, hold good for contribu-
tions of verse? How is payment made for
verse? —2l29.
When typing verse for The Bulletin leave
plenty of space between the lines and each
stanza and sign at bottom with name or
nom de plume. Each slip should be endorsed
with name and address. Verse for the
Various Verse column and other serious
verse is paid for on acceptance; other on
publication, the contributor being expected
to claim for payment in the same manner as
for pars.
Is a receipt or a cheque dated on Sunday
legal?— 2o43.
Yes.
I was induced to sign a contract for the
purchase of a block of Sydney suburban land
by the seller stating before witnesses that
he had sold two blocks to a friend of mine.
Knowing that anything my friend put his
money into would be worth investing in, I
handed over a cheque as deposit. Finding
that my friend had not purchased I immedi-
ately stopped payment of the cheque. What
action should I take? —2013.
You signed a contract. Have you read it
through carefully? You will probably find
it contains what is usually inserted in such
contracts —an admission on your part that
you have not been induced to enter into it by
reason of any representation made to you.
Would a four-gallon tin of benzine sink
to the bottom in 20 fathoms of water?—
2023.
It Avould float in Avater and support a
weight of from 10 to 12 lb.; more if in
sea water.
I have a volume the title-page of which
is set out as follow: “Ovid’s Epistles; with
His Amours. Translated into English Verse
by the most eminent hands.” The book
appears to be in good order and complete.
What is its value? —1972.
Evidently it is the supplementary portion
of the work which is usually issued under
the title of Ovid’s Book of Love. The essays
by the various persons named may give that
particular edition some additional value, but
it would not be worth more than 15s.
How can turkeys be prevented from wan-
dering?-■—2019.
Fences about Bft. high are necessary to
hold turkeys, but tbe birds soon die if pre-
vented from wandering; attempts to “farm”
turkeys in the same way as fowls have
failed.
What is a remedy for nut-grass? —2oo9.
Try repeated hoeing or digging with a
hand-fork, taking care to lift out the tubers.
Nut-grass can be smothered with sod-farming
grasses. An application of sulphate of am-
monia (4oz. to one gallon of water) will
encourage the growth of the other grass and
act as a deterrent to weeds. Quick growing
•shrubs', such as lantanas and buddleas are
useful for smothering nut-grass and other
weed pests in areas required for flower
gardens.
Is the Producers’ Distributing Co., Sydney,
exempt from the provisions of the Farm
Produce Agents Act 1926?—1838.
Yes.
I have a relief cut out of cork of Tintern
Abbey by Bernard; what is its value? —
2004.
Can’t name a figure; but very little.
How is a scenario written? —2023.
A scenario is really a story told in scenes
and sub-titles. Terms in use on scenario
writing are “long shot” (L.S.), meaning a
scene taken from a distance; “semi-long
shot” (S.L.S.), a scene photographed show-
ing details; “semi-close-up” (S.C.U.), a par-
ticular scene or character photographed close,
eliminating dispensable items; “close-up”
(C.U.), used when showing facial expres-
sions, letters, etc.; “title” (T.), a main
title; “sub-title” (S.T.), used to describe
conversations and all descriptive titles; “dis-
solve” when one scene is made to mingle with
its follower; “fade in” or “fade out” when
a scene is made to take its shape from
nothing and vice versa. The fewer titles
and conversations the better. Show every
action with a scene—don’t describe it.« By a
sequence of scenes it is possible to give your
characters’ thoughts. Terms mentioned are
written in the left-hand margin of the MS.
Then follows the scene as you would wish it
made or titles as you would have them writ-
ten. For instance : L.S.: Jungle scene. Hut
in foreground, etc. (giving description).
S.L.S.: A hut (give details). S.T. :
“The hut in the jungle” dissolve to
S.T. “Owned by the reefcomber Bates”
dissolve to S.C.U. man lying on grass.
He rises. C.U.: Bates. He scowls
and spits out tobacco-juice, etc., etc.
And so the story is Avorked out. Austral-
asian Films or Phillips Films will take scen-
arios. Payment varies according to the
nature, quality and length of story, and
ranges from £25 to £lOOO with royalties.
I leant to catch some birds alive with bir j-
limc. How is the preparation made —2o6o.
The use of birdlime for trapping birds is
prohibited in N.S.W. by the Birds’ Protec-
tion Act (1918) ; penalty not exceeding £2O.
If it is unprotected birds you want to trap
we will be pleased to suggest a humane Avay.
Approximate value of Neville Cayley's
pictures “Wounded Duck ” and “Kooka-
burra,” dated 1896 and 1897 respectively,
size 3 ft. x 2 ft? What is the value of smaller
pictures by the same artist? —3.903.
The elder Cayley’s pictures vary in value.
Those mentioned might bring from five to
eight guineas; the smaller ones should be
worth two to four guineas, much depending
on the subject.
(1) Has Winston Churchill served in the
British Army? (2) Has he erdr held any
position under the British Crown in Sierra
Leone?— l964.
(1) Winston Churchill served with the
Tirah Expeditionary Force; Nile Expedi-
tionary. Force (present at Khartoum) ; was
a war correspondent African War (taken
prisoner and escaped) ; commanded 6th
Royal Scots Fusiliers in France in 1916:
has held commissions in a number of Eng-
lish regiments throughout his career. (2)
So far as we can trace—no.
Is it necessary for a witness to a will in
N.S.W. to be 21 f—2102.
There is no specific objection to a person
under 21 witnessing a will provided lie is
of sufficient education and intelligence to
understand what he is doing and to appre-
ciate the responsibility of his act. It is,
however, always desirable to have adult wit-
nesses.
Most inexpensive method of putting a 30 in.
pipe horizontally through a big hill, distance
approximately 480 feet ? —lBl6.
The best method is to tunnel. If the
material to be excavated is rock, no timber-
ing should be required; if other than rock,
then some system of timbering should be
adopted. Timber-lined tunnel through earth
would cost £4 per lin. foot; tunnel through
rock Avould cost £6 up. There are no boring
machines suitable for excavation of tunnels.
The most convenient size of tunnel for men
to work in is 6ft. high and sft. wide. For
further particulars, communicate with
Department of Public Works, Sydney.
(1) When did disaster occur at the New
Australasian mine at Creswick ( Vic.) ?
(2) How many lives were lost? (3) What
teas the amount of the public subscription
for the relief of their dependants? And (4)
do any of the dependants still draw pen-
sions? —2124.
(1) December, 1882. (2) 22. (3)
£21,602. (4) Five widows, receiving 15s.
per week.
Remedy for chronic constipation?- —1984.
Regular exercise and regular meals are
essential to insure regular evacuation of the
boAvel. Diet should include porridge, brown
bread, uncooked fruit, salads and cresses.
Water should be drunk plentifully. These are
infinitely more valuable than medicines.
Daily use of salts, liquid paraffin, etc., have
all given success with various patients. They
should be used only till such time as the
bowel shows signs of becoming normal. The
drug habit, once established, is difficult to
break.
Can 1 learn hairdressing and racquet re-
stringing in my spare time from books? —
2033.
No. Both are trades to which learners
are apprenticed to be taught by practical
demonstration and experience.
Are the parties legally married before the
signing of the register? —2oB6.
The agreement of the parties is essential
to a valid marriage. That point in the
ceremony at which in the presence of at
least two witnesses, the man takefc the
woman to be his wife, and the woman takes
the man to be her husband, constitutes the
legal marriage. The law requires a pre-
liminary declaration, also a subsequent regis-
tration, but Avithout the agreement before
Avitnesses no marriage is constituted. Either
man or woman may withdraw before such
agreement is declared. The registration is
merely evidence of the marriage.
How can I get rid of cockroaches? —2029.
N.S.W. Health Department issues official
pamphlets dealing with the extermination of
cockroaches and similar pests. The follow-
ing powders are recommended in the order of
merit: (1) Sodium fluoride: This may be
used either by itself or mixed with sugar or
flour (cost about 2s. 6d. per lb.). (2) Borax:
This may be used pure or with cocoa or
sugar, 2 parts sugar or cocoa to 1 of borax.
(3) Pyrethrum: This should be used pure.
When cockroaches are very thick fumigation
is probably the most satisfactory method of
getting rid of them. Sulphur fumes—the
room to be closed for eight hours—-is recom-
mended. (Be careful to protect any bright
metalwork from the fumes of the sulphur.)
Three other effective remedies are: (1) Mix
some roasted apple with a little Avhite arsenic
powdered; divide the apple so prepared into
small bits, and place it in saucers in the room
at night. (2) Take one pint of oatmeal and
2oz. of arsenic, together with a little ground
aniseed and carawav-seed. Mix and lie on
pieces of paper in convenient places for the
pests. (3) Arsenic and honey may be mixed
together and laid about for them. These pre-
parations must, of course, be used with
extreme caution because of the poisonous
arsenic, and the baits should not be left
where children and pets can pick them up.

What, causes back wheels of motor-cars
to wobble, and how can the fault be rectifiedt
—2027.
Assuming that the tyres and rims are cor-
rectly fitted, probable causes would be
strained wheels due to bumps or parking hard
against kerbs; bent axle shafts from over-
loading, bad roads; or a hub carelessly
pulled up. The trouble can be rectified, but
it is best left to the wheel specialist or, in
the case of bent axles, to a good mechanic
with a Avell-fitted shop.

the roots of fresh young black thistles through
a grater, or cut up very finely and mix with
strychnine, strychnine and jam, or strych-
nine and molasses. Rabbits will sometimes
take one mixture when they won’t look at
the others. —“Sanitos.”
1755. —The blue head on the trappings of
the camel or donkey in Egypt is supposed
to act as a charm against the "evil eye”—-to
attract the look to the beads and so miss
the animal. The ornamental plate built into
the mud wall of the Egyptian house was for
the same purpose, and the filth and ragged-
ness of many a Gyppo boy was due to his
mother’s fear that if he was got up decently
he would attract the evil eye.—H.l.M.
1259. —To keep rabbits away from trees
get a shilling’s worth of the following mix-
ture from the chemist: Crysol 10 drachms,
oil of cotton seed 16 drachms, soft paraffin
41b. If crysol not obtainable use phenyl.
This is sufficient to do 300 small trees.
Paint lightly trunk of tree from ground to,
say, 18 inches up. It should last for 12
months. The mixture is quite harmless.—
L.F.S.
1536. —Piles should be potted 2ft. in rock.
Oast on land in usual way, excavate rock
bottom and allow 6in. space around for
concrete when setting. It any depth of sand
covers rock pile could be driven, as steel shoe
would penetrate sufficient to hold. —G.M.
Does Anybody Know?
A method, other than the usual pickling,
of curing mutton, so that it will keep sweet
for a fortnight? —2o9o.

Why You are Safest in Buying
a General Motors Car
* | 'HE international reputation of General
* Motors is your primary safeguard. All
over the world people have confidence in
General Motors—-believe in it. This friendly
goodwill among millions of people every-
where is General Motors greatest reward
and its greatest obligation.
It is the reward of General Motors’ policy
of building a car for every purse and purpose
—and building them so well and selling
them so fairly that to-day one out of every
four cars bought is a General Motors car.
5,000,000 General Motors cars have been
sold.
It is an obligation, because in order to keep
this international goodwill General Motors
must ever continue to build its cars of fine
quality and high value—must continue to
price them fairly and honestly—must deal
honestly and sincerely with its dealers—and
with its millions of customers.
General Motors is not remote or far off. It
is in business right her e—in everyone of
Australia’s five States. Your General Motors
local plant serves General Motors dealers
by supplying cars and parts. It aids them
in training men—aids them, too, in building
up healthy permanent businesses of their
own.
Its object is service to the car buyer—it
grows only by serving—and its very growth
is proof of its success in meeting the needs
of people everywhere.
Because it is successful—it has most at stake
—and for that very reason, too, you are
safest in buying a General Motors car.

..in the Phoenix
at 7 in the morning
TOURING the eighteenth century duelling played a
prominent part in the career of a gentleman, and in
Ireland was conducted with characteristic enthusiasm.
In Phoenix Park, a favourite rendezvous for affairs of
honor, meetings were of frequent occurrence. Though
duelling, has been superseded by more
peaceful methods, one link with duel-
ling days remains. John Jameson
Whiskey is exactly the same to-day as
in 1780, when it was first distilled.
After one hundred and fifty years tti
purity and essential character remain
unchanged. Its excellence made it
pre-eminent in the Georgian era. Its
excellence makes it pre-eminent to-
day. Always ask for “J.J.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Backers wound up the Flemington meet-
ings—wonderfully successful as far as the
V.R.C. was concerned —not unprofitably, for
three favorites were successful on Saturday.
In fact, they did no great harm on any of
the four days, albeit the Caulfield-Melbourne
Cup double was so profitable to McShortodds
(especially as so many fancied candidates
were withdrawn) that the squealing of that
person was rather ridiculous. If Ro£al
Charter had won the Caulfield Cup he would
have had something to squeal about. There
was scandalous cramping of prices, especi-
ally in the crush before the Melbourne Cup.
Visitors from other States, especially South
Aus. and Westralia, marvelled at the stupid
conservatism —now about to be overcome, as
is hoped—which has delivered so many
punters over to licensed plunderers by pre-
venting the establishment of the tote.
At a mile or a mile and a quarter Lonicera
is a good filly. In the Oaks she was out-
stayed by Valamita’s half-sister Ninbela, who
thus compensated Ben Cliaffey for dis-
appointments with his other three-year-olds;
but the chestnut daughter of Woorak —
Eudoxine had shown such pace that it was
surprising to find Farrago (5 to 2) and
Gleamlight (7 to 2) preferred to her in the
Batman Stakes on Saturday. Lonicera fin-
ished up at 5 to 1, Chariot being at 6 to 1,
The Wensum at eights and Marsias at tens.
The filly quickly showed that her Oaks run
had done her no harm; jumping out smartly,
she was never headed. At the judge’s box
Chariot was a length and a quarter behind
her, Farrago being another half-head away ;
the time was lmin. 39sec. Dave Price trains
the winner for “J. C. Hutchinson.”

Amounis and Silvius fought their Mel-
bourne Stakes battle over again in the C. B.
Fisher Plate. In the Linlithgow Stakes on
the Thursday Amounis had downed Vaals,
Gothic and Fuji San at a mile (Vaals, top-
weight and the outsider of the party, was
a good second), and the stable was con-
fident that he would avenge himself on Sil-
vius. ‘‘Our horse,” it reasoned, “finished
within a length and a half of Pantheon in
this race last year, and Silvius is not a
Pantheon (not yet, anyhow) ; besides, he
may be going off.” So the money came in
such parcels for Amounis that he saw 2. to
1, Silvius being 6 to 4 and Son o’ Mine
threes. But after Pilliwinkie (10 to 1)
had been allowed to make the running for a
mile and a quarter Silvius went to the
front, and from that point the race was
never in doubt. Amounis, finishing cour-
ageously, made a dash at the favorite. at the
distance, but Silvius went away again and
passed the judge’s box an easy winner,
Amounis being two lengths away. Yala-
mita (33 to 1) surprised by getting third
place lengths further back; Son o' Mine
didn’t finish nearly as well as he did in the
Cup. With the Moonee Valley Cup, the
Melbourne Stakes and the C. B. Fisher Plate
to his credit, Silvius has proved himself a
clinking good horse, and if his spring cam-
paign had been more judiciously managed his
earnings would have been far greater. He
ran the 12 furlongs in 2min. 34Jsec. .
Harold Jones rode Silvius in the Plate
(Ashley Reed, of course, was the Irish
horse’s Cup pilot), and the Ivillara people
engaged him for their horse in the V.R.C.
Handicap, though he had to put up 7lb. over-
weight. They thought Percival had made too
much use of the son of Magpie in the
Hotham Handicap, and relied upon Jones to
nurse him for a late run, in which case,
arguing from the Alderman .Cup experience,
they reckoned him a certainty. W ith no
little surprise and disgust they saw Ivillara
move up quickly at the back of the course as if
Jones were intent on coming away. Continu-
ing his ill-timed run, the Magpie horse was
in front five furlongs from home, and he led
round the home turn from Valwyne, Valorem,
NO FURTHER RESPONSIBILITY.
GUSSIE: “Great Scott! They’ve picked my pocket!”
FAIRY: “How lovely! Now you won’t need to waste the afternoon giving it to the
bookies —you can take me round to look at the frocks."
Frilford and Imitator. He was still in front
at the half-distance, but Imitator, getting
the last kick in, beat him by a neck, Lri-
danus being a good third, Valwyne fourth
and Frilford fifth; the time was 3mm. lfsec.
Imitator is trained by Vin o‘Neill for IV ally
Mitchell, a paddock bookmaker; she went
out at 5 to 1, as also did Ivillara, Eridanus
being favorite at 0 to 2. Jones is. a good
rider as a rule, but no on.e admired his
exhibition in this race.
Steeplechases might well be done away
with at this time of the year, but the public
was delighted to see a really good horse m
Clan Robert—very unlucky in the winter-
take both cross-country events, carrying lost,
on Cup Day and 13st. 91b. on Saturday;
Moon was aboard on both occasions. It is
to be hoped that Norman Falkiner will now
retire his good horse rather than run him
with terrific weights. The owner of Roisel
was inconsiderate enough to produce that
faithful old horse in the November Hurdle.
The poor old beggar, who has earned retire-
ment if ever horse did, ran second and
pulled up lame.
The Final Handicap was a good betting
race —Bunkie was favorite at 2 to I—and1 —and
produced a great finish. Tea Bell (15 to 1)
was the early leader from King Osric (12 to
11 Piastoon (15 to 1), Ragazzo (10 to 1),
T'reylon (9 to 2) and Bunkie, but Devonshire
(10 to 1) made a fast run half a mile from
home, and turned into the straight just
behind Tea Bell. The English horse forged
to the front at the distance, and lasted just
long enough to win by half a head from
iuars (10 to 1), Mentellini (10 to 1) being
a fair third ; the time was 2min. 4Jsec. It
was Connolly’s first success for the meeting,
and the Sydney jockey, Bartle completed
a good day—he had scored previously on
Lonicera.
Jim Scobie added another item to his long-
list of victories! in big races when imported
Star d’Or took the Williamstown Cup. The
English horse touched 3 to 1, but a point
longer became obtainable owing to continued
support for Amounis, on whom Cairns had
the mount, and Affirm, the pair closing at
5 to 1 ; Textile and Son o’ Mine were at
sixes, and Sun Morn and Bard of Avon at
tens. Lou Robertson, apparently anxious for
a pace that would suit Son o’ Mine, started
another of his team in Durability. This im-
portation led the field at a tremendous bat
as they passed the stand, and six furlongs
from home was half a length ahead of Bard
of Avon, Affirm, Amounis and Star d’Or being
handiest of the others. Affirm cut Durability
down five furlongs from home and led into
the straight from Star d’Or, Amounis and
Reputed King. After a great race all the
way down the straight, Duncan landed Star
d’Or a winner by half a head from the
unlucky Affirm, with Amounis a mere neck
away and Reputed King a close fourth. By
Sunstar —Airasliii. Star d’Or is owned by
V.R.C. chairman L. K. S. Mackinnon, who
hjought him for 3200 guineas from Sol
Green after the nag had finished second to
Bard of Avon in the same event last year.
The time was 2min. 31sec. —a race record.
Amounis’s prominence at the finish enhanced
the merit of Silvius’s performance in the C.
B. Fisher Plate; in fact, it deepened the im-
pression that if an Eric or a Paddy Connolly
had had the control of Silvius that super-
latively good three-year-old—he is only that
actually although a four-year-old by Aus-
tralian reckoning—instead of being beaten
in one Cup, would have won both.

All Mag, a Magpie gelding of whom track-
watchers formed a good opinion when lie
raced in Sydney last season, won the Bris-
bane Handicap at the Q.T.C.’s November
meeting on Saturday, beating the resurrected
Wee Gun and Budgerigah. All Mag was
favorite at 4to 1. High Syce, the 7-to-4-on
favorite for the Derby, credited McCormack
and Noud with the honor and profit, but his
performance did not altogether please those
who had supported him for the Queensland
Cup; Soulton (7 to 1) hung on too long for
their comfort. On the other hand, Sapilly
(7 to 4) disposed of the w.f.a. horses very
comfortably in the Spring Stakes and left
the nine furlongs behind in lmin. 52£sec.
There is Carbine blood in this Chipilly—
Burning Sappho chestnut, who has been very
consistent the last few months.

The Maoriland Cup went to Rapier, a six-
year-old gelding by Greyspear—Anitea; the
Carbine strain again, for Spearmint was
Greyspear’s sire. Star Stranger, winner of
last year’s A.J.C. Metropolitan, was second
to Rapier, conceding him 211 b., but never
looked like beating him. The Derby
was captured by the Limond —Waterwings
colt Agrion, who was brought over to Syd-
ney for the A.J.C. Derby, but did not care
for the hard tracks and was scratched lest
worse befall. He is trained by R. J. Mason,
who has notched his 17th M.L. Derby, and
owned by G. D. Greenwood. Agrion won •
by three-quarters of a length in 2min.
33 l-ssec.; he was followed home by Satrap
(Paladin —Persian Lilac) and Laughing
Prince (Quantock— Laughing Princess).

There was no racing in Sydney on Satur-
day ; the Roscliill course was in such a state
at 9 a.m. that the authorities decided it
would bo risky to race. The meeting was held
on Tuesday and was in favor of the book-
makers, First Acre (10 to 1) in the Fly-
ing Handicap giving them a start which
punters could not overtake. The Nursery
Handicap brought to light a very smart son
of Crowdennis in Beau Dennis (10 to 1), who
accounted for a warm favorite,. Roma Oil (5
to 4). Beau Dennis is the first of Crow-
dennis’s progeny to score. His sire was re-
nowned for speed in Britain. During the
afternoon news arrived from the city that
the Government had decided to make betting
on night trotting and tin-hare coursing
illegal, and McShortodds was obviously de-
pressed.

What the totalisator and amateur control
have done for racing in South Aus. are
memorably illustrated in the Port Adelaide
club’s programme for its Christinas meeting.
Stakes to be distributed for the two days
(Dec. 26 and 28) amount to £10,200. .The
Christmas Handicap (6i furlongs.) is a
£lOOO race, and for tlie Port Adelaide Cup
(1 mile 6 furlongs 74 yards) the prizes arc
£4500 and a trophy valued at £lOO. It is
impossible to imagine any Melbourne or Syd-
ney proprietary club offering such rewards.
Entries close on Monday afternoon at the
club’s office, Currie-street, Adelaide, and Con-
sidine's Agency, Melbourne.

“The Starter”: Months ago a. Bulletin
writer suggested that the erratic behavior
of some horses at the barrier might be due
to shortsightedness, which is notoriously the
cause of shying in the workaday prad. Now
comes news that American owners of erratic
nags are having their mokes fitted with eye-
glasses to the specifications of qualified ocu-
lists, and that the change for the better
in some cases is pronounced. After this,
the story of the Scotchman who tried to
induce his horse to live on wood shavings
by putting green spectacles on him will
lose some of its point.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘Flemington reminded me of Ascot, and I thought
the Melbourne Cup a magnificent race,’ said the
Right Hon. L. C. M. S. Amery, the visiting Secretary
for the Dominions. ‘My pleasure was not diminished
by the fact that I had my money on Trivalve.’
I was thrilled by the gorgeous scene
And the crowds that were having their
fling,
By the glint of the gold and the green,
By the riot and roar of the ring.
Twas a picture to gladden a king
Or the gloom of a wowser dispel,
A red-letter day
For L.C.M.S.A. —
I toted the winner as well.
With rapture I glowed, you may glean
From these quite unofficial remarks;
’Twas a pageant as fit for a queen
As Ascot—Royal Ascot —in Berks.
The loud-shouting books and their clerks
My oath ! were as busy as bees.
I lifted some dough
From one opulent Mo
For a trifle on Trivalve at threes.
There was thunder of hoofs on the sward.
There were frocks of the newest design,
And the ladies inside them—O Dord !
Were simply and startlingly fine ;
The most puritanic divine
Would endorse this dispassionate view.
Aught else to impress
Did I hap on? Why, yes.
I was whispered a certainty, too.
’Twas a sight in itself to reward
A statesman for crossing the brine,
A beano we couldn’t afford
The opposite side of the Line.
In my memory for ever ’twill shine,
A scene to entrance and enthral.
And the warm, pleasant glow
Of collecting the dough
Was the finest sensation of all.

“Thormanby”: French thoroughbreds have
had one of their best seasons on the Eng-
lish turf since Gladiateur first staggered the
English by winning the Derby for Count
Lagrange in 1865. This year, prads from
across the Channel have won 45 races in
England, worth £22,338.

“Van D.”: “Ike Mcßagg (B. 13/10/’27)
says that the lady bookmaker is a rarity in
Australia. The Speck can boast of one. She
can be seen at any important meeting sur-
rounded by a crowd, chiefly of women. A
capacious vanity-bag hides the betting-book,
for bookmaking is illegal in Lyons's islet.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Charles Clietwynd, of England, made his
debut in Sydney on Friday night, not as a
beauty actor but as a pug. There was 12st.
41b. of him, and his opponent was “Tiger”
Payne, who scaled his heaviest yet —12st. 21b.
From first bell to “out” (in the tenth round)
Clietwynd did not land one punch that the
dusky man-eater could notice. Charles’s one
idea seemed to be to get inside Payne’s wal-
lops and try to stay there as long as possible,
snuggled so close in sweaty embrace as to
leave neither party a chance of inflicting
punishment. It soon became obvious that
Payne was simply “carrying” him along with
a view to “business” ; all the same, the Briton
showed toughness and endurance under
punishment. In the seventh round, after
taking an awful left swing to the body, Cliet-
wynd reeled along the ropes and threw him-
self flat to avoid the stealthy Nemesis that
was following close on his heels. lie took
eight seconds, and went down again after
a tap or two. He was in sad tribulation till,
in the tenth, Payne slipped a lead and drove
one of his Darktown dinny-haysers to the
mark. Clietwynd’s wind was snatched, and
his efforts to get a breath were painful to
witness. The attendance was much larger
than has been usual of late.

Maorilander Lachie McDonald had to put
up with a severe hiding and a points defeat
when lie faced Gordon Iviely .at McHugh’s
Leichhardt Stadium on Friday night. The
Victorian scaled list. and Lachie list.

fought every inch of the 15 rounds and kept
Gordon at full tension all the while; but
Kiely has real skill and earned an unques-
tioned verdict. He looks like going far.

“S. Gumm”: Newcastle has produced “an-
other successor to Darcy” in the person of
Al Burke, a 17-year-old 11-stoner. The
aspiring youth recently disposed of Westra-
lian Eddie Butcher in a few rounds, but as
Eddie was fighting Germans before Burke
went to school, the achievement was not par-
ticularly great. It is to be hoped that the
newcomer will be wisely matched and taught
to block or otherwise get away from punches
on the head, instead of taking them on that
part of the human frame as a matter of
policy. That was a habit with certain pre-
vious “successors to Darcy” (it was never
Darcy’s habit), and it had pathetic con-
sequences.

“Brom”: Henry Santrey, the U.S. jazz
maestro lately in Australia, is asking an
American Court to settle his dispute with
Billy Grime, now endeavoring to stousli his
wav to world honors at his weight. Santrey
declares that Grime visited America under
contract to him and that 25 per cent, of the
young man’s earnings is overdue. As the
virtuoso has briefed a firm of solicitors one
of whom is named Goldstein, he evidently
means bithness. Manager and pug. parted
company after Grime’s unfortunate affair with
“Honey Boy” Finnegan at Madison-square
Garden. A Sam Fitzpatrick might have
made something of Grime, but a jazz-band
conductor —Lawdelpus!
* * * *
“Mitt Shover” : Another roseate hope was
dimmed in Noo Yark when Phil Scott, one
of Tex Rickard’s aspirants for the right to
meet Tunney, was unmercifully belted by
one Knut Hansen, described as a third-rater.
Much was expected of Scott, but he made a
miserable showing, being banged to the floor
seven times and finally outed in the first
session. It seems a lot to cross the wide
Atlantic for, but no one effn say Scott didn’t
get his money’s worth, whatever may have
been the case of those who paid to see him.
Scott was one of the numerous conquerors
of our own George Cook.

The wrestling gentry have outstayed their
welcome in Melbourne, and though Saturday
night's programme looked good on paper
and ivas for “charity,” there wasn’t much
in the house. Miller (12st. 61b.) was much
too good for Karasick (same weight) in the
opening tussle and received the decision on
points. Mike Yokel (I2st. 101 b.) and John
Kilonis (12st. 71b.) made their bout willing,
Ivilonis especially—butting, biting and
hair-pulling were features of his display.
Coming up for the fourth Mike’s left eye
was almost closed, and the Greek, after
roughing him, repeatedly scored with his
Boston crab. Mike made it a fall each with
a dump and body press, only to see the idol
of the oyster-vendors crowned winner on
points.
The Ins and Outs
“Fitzcray”: As anxious as its friendly
rivals to unearth new bowlers, the Vic. Asso-
ciation is providing a coaching net for
aspiring youths at the Melbourne C. G. Hugh
Trumble will give the boys the benefit of his
advice, and there is no man more capable.
The Cabbage Garden has a likely crop of
youngsters this season. A lot is expected
of Dummett, of Fitzroy, who has been getting
some very good figures in the pennant
matches. Other young fellows of promise are
A’Beckett (University), Alexander (Essen-
don), Makin (Collingwood) and Francis
(Prahran).
* * * *
“Old Trafford”: “Aigburth” styles Alec
Watson (B. 27/10/'27) “another fast
chucker,” and refers to Arthur Mold as a left-
hander. The fact is that Watson was a slow
bowler, particularly deadly on rain-affected
wickets, and that Mold was right-handed.
And “A.” might have added to the list of
Lancashire’s importations Poidevin, S. F.
Barnes, Ilallam, Parkin and Sharp—all first-
class performers and three of them inter-
nationals.
* * * *
“Torrens”: Norman Williams, the Adel-
aide slow bowler, who last year ran Grimmett
to a short head for the greatest number of
wickets taken in the Sheffield Shield series—
he got 29 wickets at 32.27 each, as against
Grimmett’s 30 at 34.66 —has made a fine
start in the grade games, as he did last year.
For a couple of seasons past Williams has
outshone the ex-Victorian in the club
averages, and it may be that he will now
take the place in big cricket that his
admirers have been predicting for him ever
RUBBING IT IN.
SAWBONES (who is winning easily ): “Buck up, padre! You look as if someone had
laid you a stymie on the collection-plate.”
since he stepped into the South Australian
XI.
:!: * -Jr *
“Mollyhander”: I’. Habich, a medium-
paced lefthander, has been putting up some
good bowling performances in S. Aus.
country cricket this season, including 6 for
98 in a score of 388 at Thebarton. A school-
teacher, like Woodful], Habich has had little
chance of continued practice on turf. But
last season he played for a time with West
Torrens, and in 100 overs took 19 wickets
at a cost of 21,42 runs each; in his last
match he got 3 for 15 and 7 for 31. With
a taking, smooth action, he spins the ball
both ways. He may yet do for S. Aus. what
Bill Wliitty did when Bill was young and
slender.
* * * *
“Norwood”: South Australia is leaving
nothing to chance in the effort to retain the
Sheffield Shield, won. last season after
many years. The State' selection committee
is to hold a bowling competition for young-
sters under 23. A similar idea was tried
on the recommendation of .1. N. Crawford,
when that spectacled young man from Sur-
rey was coaching in S.A. Each bowler was
asked to bowl 24 balls to such batsmen as
Clem Hill, Gehrs and Crawford himself;
there were cash prizes ranging from £lO
downwards. Then the war came and the
competition was resultless, but the South
Australians hope the new attempt will
have better luck.
“Tenth Slip” : New ground will be broken,
in a cricket sense, if the N.S.W. Association
consents to the State eleven playing at
Broken Hill on its way to Adelaide for the
Sheffield Shield engagement there. The link-
ing up of the Barrier with N.S.W. by means
of the railway from Menindie has now
made a visit possible; the old-time circui-
tous route by way of Adelaide put anything
of the sort out of the question. The Hill
can claim to have produced some good
cricketers in the past —wasn't Ernie Jones
a resident at one time? —and the local men
are very keen on a match with a side of
Sheffield Shield calibre. The Oldfield team’s
trip to Malaya was the means of Darwin
being discovered in a cricket sense. A visit
from Ivippax’s lads might perform the same
task for Broken Hill.
* * * *
“Tyke”: In spite of the Cassandra-like
warnings of Lord Hawke and other diehards,
the Yorkshire County committee lias appointed
Herbert Sutcliffe, a mere pro., to captain
Yorkshire, Now that the fell deed has been
done, little has been heard from Hawke, per-
haps because that choleric nobleman is too
full for words. But most of the other lead-
ing amateurs, present and past, are bearing
up manfully under the strain; even Percy
Fender —a most exclusive Percy, as Aus-
tralia knows —has signified approval. The
solidest opposition to the change comes from
the ranks of the professionals themselves.
Roy Ivilner, for instance, testily points out
that, if the committee was determined to
have a professional skipper—and he, for one,
would rather serve under an amateur any
day—the old hands of the team had stronger
claims than a “post-war product.”
Racquet and Bawl
“Tranmere” : G. M. Hone, who impressed
good judges as a Davis Cup possibility a
couple of years ago but hasn’t played much
first-class tennis since, will be available for
selection next year. So will E. T. Rowe.
The two South Australians have been in-
vited to Nliill (Vic.) on November 19 to play
in exhibition games against Gerald Patter-
son. Whether they will be able to attend
the trials in Sydney and Melbourne, as well
as the Australian championships, is a ques-
tion yet to be settled. The cost of the long-
drawn-out trip will be heavy. Possibly the
S.A. tennis authorities will assist in the
matter of expenses.
* sis * *
“Willy Willy”: The Westralian L.T.A.
is holding its championships at Christmas,
and has intimated that it will be glad to
see any of the eastern players in action at
Perth. With the Australian championships,
the contests with the Frenchmen and the
Davis Cup trials coming on, most of the
cracks will bo otherwise engaged, but
O’Hara Wood may go again. If he does the
Westralians will find him as interesting a
fellow as ever, on the courts and off.
'!> sji
“Perdoocer”: There seems to be a rush
to sign up English tennis flappers as film
heroines. Following on the engagement of
Betty Nuthall (B. 27/10/’27), Evelyn Col-
yer and Joan Ridley have been booked to
appear in a picture dealing with the Nurse
Cavell tragedy. The two damsels are to
figure as nursing probationers, and both are
probably sufficiently inured to the camera
to face the flicks without flinching. How
it will affect their amateur status is not yet
known. The English E.T.A. is probably
considering that problem behind locked
doors.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.”: The English L.T.A. has
again fluttered its dovecotes by proposing to
debar amateurs from receiving money for
writing newspaper articles, or giving inter-
views about games in which they have been
engaged, or broadcasting their impressions of
them. Those daily papers which rely on well-
known names to sell their tennis comment
to the public are naturally indignant, and
the Daily Express accuses the L.T.A., with
some justice, of inconsistent running. It
points out that “amateurs” are paid to use
special racquets and balls, are accommodated
free by hotel proprietors during tennis tour-
naments, and take their prizes in the shape
of “orders” which are easily convertible into
cash. Everyone is aware of these practices,
and the L.T.A. winks at them. Yet it now
says that to write or broadcast for pay
about an amateur game is to become a pro-
fessional at that game. It is certainly a case
for the stewards.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Divot Digger” : Svdney, with its solitary
and overcrowded municipal golf-course,
might ponder on the case of Aberdeen, which
possesses several. In one week alone these
were patronised by 10,453 players; the
revenue from May to August inclusive (and
the charges are small) was £4474. Nor
does Aberdeen stand alone, for many other
towns in Scotland and England go in for
public courses. The famous links at Stirling,
where Queen Mary of Scots was wont to
play, belonged to the burgesses of the city
long before her day, and were open to all
and sundry for a small fee, which was used
for the upkeep of the greens. In America
to-day no town with any pretensions to be
more than a second-rate village is without
its public golf-course. In fact, that is the
case in every English-speaking country, Aus-
tralia excepted.
❖ * *
“Ploughman”: The Rugby Waratahs (B.
3/11,/’27) are not the only visiting athletes
on whose heads the lightning of the
Field’s wrath has descended. A recent
victim was Walter Hagen, the American pro-
fessional golfer, who is admitted, even by
his countrymen, to take an outsize in hats.
Walter announced that the reason British
pros, did not beat the Americans was trace-
able to the snobbery of British amateurs,
which reacted on the morale of the pros.
Says the Field in its lofty way : “We shall
require further proof before we can hold that
the American professionals owe their suc-
cess (or the want of it) to circumstances
which make it difficult for an amateur to
protest when addressed by his Christian,
name by a person whom he pays to play
with him.” It is not easy to follow the
creaky old journal’s argument, but there can
be no doubt about the beauty of the senti-
ment.
* * * *
“E.lv.”: Although in his eightieth year,
Harry Lording, of the Northern club (Vic.),
still enjoys his week-end 36 holes of golf.
He covers about 175 yards with his driver,
and his putting is wonderfully good. His
methods prove the fallacy of many pet
theories, for “Pa” stands with one hand
behind his back to hole the eight- and ten-
footers. Another remarkable Vic. veteran is
Hugh Ross. He is in his 72nd year, and
can "walk the legs off many of the younger
brigade. He plays the Royal Melbourne
course for scores below eighties. His best
score so far is 75, but he thinks he can do
better. During last week-end he turned on a
76 in a four-ball match and, needless to
state, collected the stakes —out, home and
on the match. What a good thing Hugh
would be in a score-for-age event!
* * * *
“Colonel Damurize”: One of those features
of golf which help to drive its conscientious
exponents to apoplexy is the habit indulged
in by many players who should know better
of calling their clubs “sticks.” It is a
puerile inaccuracy which should be beneath
the notice even of an associate member, and
it gives me great pleasure to note that a
leading English golf journal has explained
the whv and wherefore. In spite of all my
Scottish friends may say, golf wms originally
a Dutch game. The word “golf” is nothing
more than a slight corruption of the Dutch
word “kolf,” which means a club. Thus
the misguided individual who refers to his
“golf sticks” is merely remarking on his
“club sticks,” which sounds foolish, even
after a long stay at the nineteenth hole.
I am less in accord with the journal when it
. avers that the word “caddie” is merely an
• adaptation of the French word “cadet.” More
likely it is a variation of the old word
i “cad.” once applied to all hangers-on at
■ games, but now mostly used with a special
i significance.

The Ever-Ready Co. (Gt. Briuin) Ltd.
163 Pitt Street, Sydney
“Trembler” : The way of many men with
a motor-ear nowadays is to look for a
record put up by someone else and smash it.
The latest success in that line is credited
to Messrs. Lapliam and Cooper, of Orange
(N.S.W.), who covered the 512 miles from
Sydney to Bourke in I2hr. 15min., an average
speed of 41.7 m.p.h. The most interesting-
feature of the achievement was that the car,
a 11)24 Essex, was “salvage stock.” It
had run 20,000 miles for its original owner
before being damaged by fire. It was bought
from the insurance company for £25, and,
after reconditioning, resumed duty with most
of the original parts. A cylinder gasket and
two steering-pins were the only replacements,
while there were some slight gear and other
minor adjustments.
* if Hs *
“Coil” : A car race on a fuel-consumption
basis was run at Brooklands recently. The
distance was 150 miles—46 laps of the
course —and the allowance of fuel varied
with engine capacity; the cars were also
handicapped as regards time, the limit being
one hour 54sec. start. The .winner, an Aus-
tin Seven, was on the limit mark; it was
allowed 4f gallons of fuel. The backmarkers,
a 4398 c.c. Bentley and a 4803 Stutz, started
off scratch with an allowance of 17f gallons.
The Austin Seven cut out the distance at an
average speed of 52.1.1 m.p.h., with some
petrol left at the finish. It won by a lap
from Captain Campbell’s 1990 c.c. Bugatti,
with Barnato’s Bentley two laps behind
Campbell in third place.

“Boggo”: Brisbane motor-cycling con-
tinues to supply its thrills, and, as a local
journal puts it, “draws keenly interested
crowds” —much as the Lions v. Christians
turn at the Coliseum did in Nero’s days.
Billy Lamont. the Sydney rider, referred
to in a recent Bulletin, was again the hero
of a spine-tickler. In the first heat of a race
he “executed a sensational broadside skid,
from which he only emerged triumphant
through a superbly skilful effort.” Nemesis
was in pursuit of William, however; in the
second heat lie was unseated and couldn’t
regain his saddle. “For a hundred yards
he wrestled with a machine travelling at
over 40 m.p.h. The crowd watched the
struggle, spellbound, till he was flung as
from a catapult, and the riderless machine
dashed headlong into the safety fence.” The
jigger was wrecked, the chronicler adds, but
Lamont was “absolutely” unhurt.
* * * *
“C.E.” : At the Adelaide Motor-cycle Club's
opening meeting on the Smithfield speedway,
Maorilander H. Maugham established a solo
track record for S.A. by covering five miles
in 4min. 6 3-ssec. A. Lewis, of Victoria,
put up new S.A. figures in the side-car event-
over the same distance: 4min. 27sec. from
a standing start.
“Hotham”: The Wonthaggi-to-Melbourne
race of 78 miles, a preliminary test for the
Dunlop Grand Prix, enabled Hubert Opper-
man to give further evidence of his great-
ness as a road-cyclist. Though he did not
finish first, Opperman made fastest time,
3hr. 33min. 391 sec. The first man home was
the N.S.W. rider J. Summers, who started
off the 24-minute mark; his time was 3hr.
54min. 14sec. L. Einseidel, winner of last
year’s Warrnambool-Melbourne race, was
third.
* * * *
“Ball Race”: The Prix de Frioh, an
annual puslibike event held in Marseilles in
memory of the French sprint champion who
was killed in the war—the distance is a kilo-
metre —resulted in a win for English rider
W. J. Bailey, who was seen in action in
Sydney and Melbourne some years ago.
Lucien Michard, of France, was second, and
Martinetti, the Italian, third; fourth place
was Jlled by Sydney lad George Dempsey.
The placed men were all world’s amateur
champions in their day. Bailey won the
title in 1909-10-11-13, Michard in 1924-25,
Martinetti in 1926.
Miscellaneous
Last week the Waratalis played two of the
stiffest matches of tlicir tour and won them
both. The mid-week affair was against Cam-
bridge Uni., famous for strong sides —the
Wallabies beat one by 11 to 9 and the
second All Blacks another by 5-0. The
N.S.W. team won a hard game by 18 to 11;
all the scoring for the visitors was in the
first half. In the game against United Ser-
vices on Saturday the figures were also
close, though the Waratahs seem to have
been on top most of the time. The Services,
who fielded nine international players, led
by 6-3 at half-time, but the Waratahs finished
with 13 to 11; they would have made it
much more decisive but for their wingers
missing many chances. The next match, on
Saturday, will be against Ireland.
“Past Grammar” : The Rugby Union game
has been established in Italy. That fair
land of the cypress and myrtle has been
dallying with Soccer since 1917, when the
British regiments on the Piave introduced
the round-ball game, but Rugby made its
official entry recently, when an Italian XV
met a French side at Bologna. According
to the cables the Italians “played the game
with such boisterous vigor as to raise hopes
that Italians will excel in it.” It is a pious
aspiration, and one not unlikely to be fulfilled
now that Mussolini has banned duelling. If
the parties to a quarrel are on opposite sides,
a game of Rugby is an excellent substitute
for the older and less dangerous method of
giving the other fellow “satisfaction.”
* * * *
“Jack Point”: “Robbo’s” (B. 27/10/’27)
assertion that greyhound-racing without bet-
ting wouldn’t last two months anywhere will
be thoroughly tested in Brisbane. At the
first meeting in that city there were about
12,(XX) spectators (or so it was alleged),
and one kill was registered, something going
wrong with the hare’s works—the suggestion
that some of the dogs “filled it up” isn’t
credited. There were bookies in abundance,
and the loudest offenders were roped in by
the law. The management talked a lot
about being “confident that the sport would
appeal to the public on its merits” and “not
being in favor of betting.” Nevertheless the
programmes were perforated into significant
.little squares, so that patrons might have a
little (illegal) sweepstakes amongst them-
selves.
* * * *
“Shepherd’s Bush” : The tin-hare game is
eating into the big Soccer attendances in
Britain, and the small bookmaker has fol-
lowed the money, taking with him many
clients who used to bet on League and Cup
matches. As a consequence, the British
Football Association, which rules its adher-
ents with a rod of iron, has forbidden its
affiliated clubs to let the dog-racing industry
have the use of their grounds even after the
football season. A trumpet of rebellion has
been blown by Joseph Mears, a director of
the Chelsea club, and an official of the
association itself. Mears owns the fine
ground at Stamford Bridge where Chelsea
club has its headquarters, and has announced
that in the off-season for football he will
do what he dashed well likes with his own
property—will, in fact, open it as a hare-ea
(or whatever the proper monniker may be)
when Soccer shuts down next May. The
association is busy working out its position.

“Minto”: Another identity of the Rand-
wick fiat (B. 29/9/’27) was the sovereign-
and-purse sharper. Producing a brand-new
purse he would drop five sovereigns into it
and throw the article on the ground. “To
advertise these purses,” he’d chant, “I’m
willing to make a sacrifice. Who’ll give me
a pound for that one?” A mug generally
rushed the offer, but the buttoner rushed,
too. “I think you were the first to claim it,
sir,” the sharper would say to the buttoner;
ANDREW CHARLTON, whom a Vic-
torian authority considers ’ the only
Australian swimming representative
worth sending to Amsterdam.
“the other gent, can have the next one. But
to show that everything is fair I’ll ask him
to pick the purse up and hand it to you.
The mug did as directed and the buttoner
showed the contents to the crowd. When the
game began again the mug generally jumped
in early with his pound. Then the sharper
would say to the buttoner, “That gentleman
picked up the purse for you ; it’s your turn
to pick it up for him.” The buttoner would
pick up the purse, but the one he would hand
to the mug would be as empty as the boast
of a defeated politician.

“Murrungurry”: Binghi was always a
great lover of sports. While the young fel-
lows engaged in athletics and acrobatics,
the old men played a kind of bowls. Any
level bit of ground was the green; the bowls
were smooth stones collected from the rocky
beds of running streams and prized accord-
ing to their roundness. The majority w’ere
a bit eccentric; they also varied in size

Cantata Stakes and, Silvius in the Mel-
bourne Stakes and the C. B. Fisher
Plate at Flemington.
and weight; but the old fellows enjoyed their
game as long as their favorite bowls were
not chipped or split by hard knocks. I have
come upon broken bowls on old camping
grounds. At some places there wore broken
heads also. I don’t know if there was any
connection between the two.
* * * *
“Gun-beater”: The N.S.W. Athletic
Association has made up its mind to send a
team to Maoriland in spite of the wolf on
its doorstep (B. 3/11/’27). A committee
has been appointed to raise the funds neces-
sary for a team of six; as the lads will
have to leave Sydney by December 16 at
latest, there is no time to be lost. R. C.
Coombes, A. L. Harwood and L. J. Drake
are to do the selecting.
:!: :j! * $
“Der Jong”; While N.S.W. has been
jubilating over the discovery of a probable
champion sprinter in Carlton, South Africa
has also dug up a schoolboy prodigy. His
name is D. Joubert, and he hails from Dun-
dee, a colliery town in northern Natal. At
the local school sports he twice ran the 100
yards in 9 4-5 sec. Ten minutes after his
second sprint lie ran the 220 yards in 22sec.
dead. They know something about track
athletics in South Africa, and by all
accounts there can be no doubt about the
youngster’s times. Carlton’s figures at the
G.P.S. meeting in Sydney were lOsec. for
the 100 and 21 4-ssec. for the 220, so honors
may be said to rest easy between the pair.
“Blade”: According to W. A. Stevenson,
Maoriland representative in the sculling
event at Henley-on-Yarra, the M.L. rowing-
authorities are very anxious for a visit from
a New South Wales crew and a sculler in
1928. They are forwarding a formal invita-
tion ; if it is accepted the M.L. champion-
ships will be made to coincide with the
visit. The races will be held on the Wan-
ganui River, one of the finest courses in the
world. Though the All Blacks have been
sending crews across to Australia constantly
during the past few years, the matter of
returning the visits has been shelved time
and again on the old cry of expense.
“Swivel” : There is a strong feeling among
Sydney rowing enthusiasts that the venue of
the inter-State race for the King’s Cup should
be transferred to the Nepean course at
Penrith. The Westralian R. A. has asked
the N.S.W. authorities to consent to this
being done; the reports of the course and of
the ideal accommodation for training crews
brought back by the Perth Uni. crew, which
won the Oxford and Cambridge inter-Varsity
Cup there, set the Westralian body moving.
The only objection to the change is that
revenue would be lost, but as the Universities
managed to collect £4OO for their wet-day
show, the prospect in this respect cannot
be reckoned dismal. And there would be a
great lessening of overhead expense—the
heavy cost of special steamers would be cut
out, for one thing.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“X.D.” : Wesley Church, in Lonsdale-3treet.
Melbourne, is trying a new way of raisins
missionary money. It has turned its back
yard into a motor-parking area at threepence
lower than prevailing prices.
$ # * t
“Coot” : Vic. Railway Commissioner Clapp
expects to net a substantial revenue from
the accumulations of orange and lemon peel
at railway-station soft-drink stalls. Every
month the peel amounts to two or three
tons, and a wholesale confectioner is to buy
the lot.
“Tuart”: During the late whaling season
in North Westralia, 813 whales were killed
by the crew of the Havorn 11., one of the
smaller vessels owned by tin* Norwegians
controlling the industry. Captain Norch-
Olsen, her skipper, says lie has been shooting
whales since 1911, when he started in the
Antarctic, and North-Westralia has the
richest whaling grounds in the world.
Seldom is a Norse skipper so communicative.
s!i * =l= *
“O.IMI.”: The Synagogue in Bourke-
street, Melbourne, next to St. Pat's Hall,
has been sold to the Equity Trustees for
£52,500, or nearly £BOO a foot. So an old
landmark, neighbor of the building in which
the first Vic. Parliament met between 1851
and 1856, will be demolished to make room
for something modern. The Chosen have
drifted St. Ivildawards, and there is to be
a new temple in a more convenient spot.
* * * *
“AdeL.”: A valuable timber growing in
abundance in the Gulf country is Excwcaria
parvifolia, which yields a handsome cabinet
wood. Specimens sent to France before the
war wore valued at £BO a ton. The tree
yields a kind of caoutchouc, and tin* bark of
one variety contains 12 to 15 p.c. of tannin;
this variety, when cut green, exudes a milky
substance which will cause blindness. Stock-
men in the Gulf earn tobacco-money by
making serviette-rings out of the wood.
“P.X.”: These days the fire insurance
office is deeply interested in Sydney ferry
traffic. This type of company writes three-
fourtlis of the N.S.W. Workers’ Compen-
sation policies; and under the new law any
worker who is killed or injured while going
to or coming from work, provided he doesn't
make any unnecessary detour, is covered by
the policy his employer has taken out. The
Watson’s Bay disaster happened rather
early in the afternoon; but even so a good
many employers’ liability cheques will have
to be signed by the underwriters.
* * *
‘“M.0.8.” : There’s a loophole for fraud in
the Commonwealth telegraph m.o. system.
In the case of money telegraphed from M.L.
the private advice is embodied in the official
message. The p.m. at the receiving office
then advises the payee to call and collect,
which seems all right. But this advice con-
tains the sender's name in full, his address
the amount sent and the private portion of
the official message. Thus anyone becoming
wrongly possessed of this message is armed
with all possible information. Instead, the
payee should be asked to call and furnish
the same.
*«*
“1.D.8.”: The Queensland Government’s
re-entry into the gem-buying business —pur-
chasing by outsiders is banned —has not
proved a brilliant success. It despatched a
buyer to the sapphire field with orders
to get £2OOO worth of “best blues.” Before
he opened out, headquarters wired reducing
his buying allowance to £1000; as the result
of a mass meeting of miners and urgent tele-
grams to the Premier, the original amount
was restored. But as 162 people had booked
for selling, even £2OOO won't go far. The
diggers would rather have a buyers’ combine,
with all its disadvantages, than a Govern-
ment monopoly when the Government is hard
UP ' *
“H.D.C.”: “Kwinana” (B. 27/10/’27) is
out of touch with Queensland land-line con-
struction. Most of the N.-Q. lines are
copper—Australian made at that. High-
resistance galvanised wire would not permit
of conversation between Cairns and Mel-
bourne. If “Kwinana” has seen a line
sagging on the ground for miles, it is prob-
ably some private line. Thursday Island has
not been isolated telegraphically for four
months, as it was possible to work through
the cable fault by buzzer. When it was
necessary to cut cable to make tests, or
patch, traffic was worked off by radio. Cairns
was not isolated for three weeks, nor were
Cooktown and the Gulf stations cut off for
two months. The February cyclone hit the
coast on a Wednesday evening: by Saturday
afternoon telegraph and telephone communi-
cation w r as through from Cairns, and that
with lines dowm for over 150 miles between
Cairns and Ingham. The Thursday Island
fault was due not to land-lines but to a
submarine cable-sheathing wearing through
on the coral bed after 33 years of use.

The Metropolitan Section of the Society
of Automotive Engineers held a contest
in January for the design of an “Ideal
Car.”
1 50 automotive engineers competed for
the prize. The specifications submitted
by the contestants were synthetized into
a composite set of specifications for an
“Ideal Car’’ —that dream of all engineers
—that hope of all automobile owners.

In almost every detail the Flying Cloud speci-
fications are exactly similar to those of the
Engineer’s Ideal Car. This partly explains
the phenomenal sales of the Flying Cloud in
America since its introduction in January
last.
Named after the well-known American
Clipper, the Flying Cloud, famed in the middle
of last century for her speed and graceful
lines, the Flying Cloud car brings to motor-
dom a new idea of car performance.
The Flying Cloud is a pleasure car, low slung
with clean sweeping lines, capable of ex-
tremely rapid acceleration and high sustained
speed. This car will give to every motorist that
“something” which his own good car lacks.

STOCKINGS
At last the ferry disaster that every Har-
bor traveller has dreaded for years past has
wiped away the gay look of Port Jackson.
At half-past four on Thursday the Greycliffe
left the Quay for Watson’s Bay with her
passengers, many of them vividly alert school
kiddies; a few minutes later, off Bradley’s
Head, the outgoing Tahiti drove into her and
turned her completely over. So far as is
known the death toll is between 45 and 50,
and assuredly it would have been more had
not school sports that afternoon delayed
many of the regular travellers.
The one triumph that man has snatched
from the hungry sky-blue waters is the
heroism and unselfishness displayed by those
who struggled amid the wreckage. Men who
had managed to clutch a lifebelt or a splint-
ered spar gave it up to women and children.
Anyone lucky enough to have grasped a
plank or a floating seat tried to push the
chance-to-live closer to others in the swirling
water. One schoolboy gamely supported a
girl till, coming on a lifebuoy that sus-
tained them, both were picked up. Other
boys on their way from school proved of
Anzac breed ; nor were the girls lacking in
courage and unselfishness. In a few minutes,
of course, the Tahiti’s boats were lowered,
and every ferry in the outer reaches of the
Harbor rushed to the rescue. Passengers
who had managed to dive or had been flung
clear were those upon whom the sign of good
fortune turned aside the rushing wings of
Azrael. But the dark and hideous fate of
those trapped in the cabins ! Two lion-hearts
the moment brought forth were Fred Jones,
deckhand of the Greycliffe, and Fred Corby,
fireman of the Tahiti; the latter dived into
the devil’s maelstrom from the rails to the
rescue of two small children.
Among the dead was Mrs. Millicent Maud
Bryant, one of Australia’s first women avia-
tors ; and only last week she was at the wed-
ding of her son. Other well-known victims
were Dr. Reid, Chief Quarantine Officer,
whose great height (lie was 6ft. 84in.)
has made many a newcomer wonder what
race of giants lived in the land; Surgeon
Lieut.-Commander W. E. J. Paradice, of the
Australian Navy; Dr. R. Lee-Brown, Prisons
Medical Officer; and Mr. R. C. J. Wright,
science master of Sydney High School.
Tennis-courts were empty, lawn-mowers
were still, all the trivial things of work and
play which make up the sum of a suburb’s
happiness had been laid aside at Watson’s
Bay and Vaucluse on Saturday. For the
Quick was taking its last farewell of the
Dead. South Head Cemetery was Watson’s
Bay on Saturday. Here men and women
and children came in their thousands. Here
10 bodies —two of them wrapped in the flag
of the country they were serving—were re-
turned to mother earth. At Rookwood four
more were buried. At Manly Mrs. Millicent
Bryant, one of the first women in Australia
to win her air pilot’s certificate, was accom-
panied on her last journey by the whir of
five ’planes that circled the cemetery till
the final sod was in place. A wreath of blue
delphiniums and red carnations (the Aero
Club’s colors) was dropped from one of the
’planes on the grave of this intrepid Aus-
tralian. Of her three sons only one was at
the graveside. One is hurrying back from
Tasmania, where he was honeymooning; the
other, who has been away in England, is
expected home this month.
At the funeral of Dr. Reid two small
clrldren with spades had, with their mother,
taken their place near the mound of sand at
the head of the great coffin; and here while
the service was in progress they made their
castles. Meanwhile the two tall sons—one
is six-feet eight, too, the other six-feet six
and was to have been married next week —-
stood like young giants by the grave.
Young Commander Paradice. wise in
lore of fish and bird and flower, who
rang up his home to say he was crossing
to the Quay to make a purchase and at
the last moment apparently changed his
mind, leaves a small baby and a young
widow to mourn him. Mrs. Paradice was one
of the three tall Houston sisters.
Then there was the little mother to whom
her son of 16 dived through the windows of
the cabin where she had sat, and caught her
and held her for an instant, only to have her
torn away. And so on, and so on—each
street shaken with the horror of its particu-
lar tragedy.
A Vaucluse lady, Mrs. Carruthers, was in :
a steamer bound for Sydney when the acci- i
dent occurred. She saw her son, who was on
his way home from the Grammar School, <
struggling in the water; but although the
ferry picked up a number of people, the boy :
was not amongst them. She had to endure the
agony of uncertainty until she learnt, later, -
that her son had been rescued by another
boat and was in Sydney Hospital.
Parliament was opened last week with,
among other excitements, a tea party for the
ladies. This occurred after his Ex. had been
whisked back to Government House accom-
panied by the clatter of mounted police. Lady
de Chair and Elaine assisted the ceremony
with their presence, Lady de Chair wearing
a wide black lace hat above her black fringed
frock. Mrs. Bavin brought daughter Shirley
to see how father carved the duck. But
the opening of Parliament is not the Pre-
mier’s big act. On such occasions the Usher
of the Black Rod and the Speaker (again
he is Dan Levy) seem of much greater im-
portance. Mrs. Fred Flowers, wife of the
President of the Leg. Council, hostessed the
tea party in the President’s room. Hers,
even as the Vicar of Bray’s, is a perennial
job, and whatever Government reigns she is
Queen of the Urns. She brought a trig black
and white outfit to this year’s function.
Among the cup-and-saucer jugglers were the
artistic wife of Brig.-General Anderson, Mrs.
Harry Budge and Major Longfield Lloyd and
his lady. All the vice-regal party wore Court
lialf-mourning.
The Secretary of State for the Dominions,
with Mrs. Amory, has flown northward, after
a couple of days in Sydney spent in the
shelter of Government House. Mrs. Amery
is a slim, dark woman, very interested in
the new woman-settler. Incidentally, her
ideas of Australian distances are undergoing
rapid change. At one of her London recep-
tions early this year she brought a Maori-
lander up to two of this Letter’s friends.
“You must,” said she, “meet Mr. Enzed.
That is, if you don’t already know one
another —with such a little strip of water
between you!”
Ex-Premier Lang armed daughter Laura
up the aisle of St. James’s last Thursday.
The tryst was with Frederick George Hill,
of Auburn, and the dark-haired bride wore
a souffle of georgette, guipure lace and tulle.
Bonnie Scott and El lie Lang ’maided m
silken raiment, and Mrs. Lang stepped in to
lead later on at the Dungowan, in Martin-
place, in sand-colored georgettes topped by a
hat of golden straw.
The demure little kirk in Yeo-street,
Neutral Bay, wore a carpet of confetti from
its front step to the gate after the linking
up of Eileen Waugh to Alfred C. Manning,
whose father was the well-known Dr. Man-
ning, of Woolwich. The bride, who is the
youngest of Padre Hope Waugh’s chicks,
weighted her white chiffons with silver beads,
and was veiled and bouqueted according to
time-honored precedent. Sister Hope ’maided
in lilac and silver, topped by a hat of lilac
tulle.
The kirk was the centre of interest at
Auburn midway through last week when
Tom Andrews, the international cricketer,
was married to Marcia Picken, of that
suburb. Silver lame, ivory georgette and
Limerick lace were allied in the bride’s
raiment, and her one attendant wore sea-blue
taffetas garlanded with hand-made flowers.
Herewith Frances Scully, the clever
teacher of dancing, whose juvenile ballets
are seen on the Tivoli, at the picture-theatres
and in the big
Sydney cafes.
Frances goes
off by the
Sonoma next
month to
search Lon-
don, New York
and Paris for
ideas, and be-
fore she goes
her pupi 1 s,
past and pre-
sent, are giv-
in g her a

torium. There

ters, and their

dancing ar.»
taught, is kept busy with over 400 ambitious
little pupils.
St. Paul’s, in Burwcod, beamed on Phyllis
Pcarse in her sheen of satin and mist of
tulle. Convoyed by father (he’s Captain
I’earse, of Strathfield) and ushered in on a
wave of choral harmony, Phyllis took her
stand beside Valentine Vincent, of Pembroke,
Cassilis, and, questioned by Padre Harry
Bryant, expressed her intention of staying
there for life. Cool and glamorous looked
the four ’maids in frocks of translucent green,
in the hems of which cream and golden
water-lilies were tangled. There was a
suggestion of a water-baby, too, about a
small Docker child dressed in green muslin,
her gold hair caught back with a chaplet
of green leaves. Roubaix, the I’earse home
at Strathfield, was a riot of roses for the
subsequent reception.
Water-lilies and a full choral outburst
were accompaniments when Winifred Good-
win made the great surrender to Marcus
Woodforde. Venerable old St. Mark’s, at
Darling Point, blessed the gyves, and Iloni-
ton lace and white georgette with a long,
long trail of silver formed the wadding gar-
ment. Three rosily blushing and spreading
tulle frocks billowed in the bride’s wake.
They were worn by Mrs. David Harris,
Kathleen Waddington and Janice Thompson.
The wedding dinner was eaten at the Ambas-
sadors. Winifred is the youngest bud of the
Goodwins, of Ashfield, and the bridegroom is
a son of Dr. Woodforde, one time of Dubbo.
This is a
picture of Mrs.
Bryant, taken
for The Bul-
LETIN last
February. It
was from the
’plane of her
proud instruc-
tor in flying,
Captain Leg-
gatt, that the
wreath from
the Aero Club
was dropped
on her grave
last Saturday
—as this Let-
ter has said
elsewhere, she
was one of the
victims of the
Greycliffe dis-
aster.
Lieut.-Colonel C. J. Holford, of Mosman,
squired daughter Sylvia to St. James's on
Saturday and then handed her over to George
Orchard, only son of the Orchards who mix
watches and politics. Simplicity and Chan-
tilly lace were the features of the bride's
attire ; and rose georgette _ blushing against
plumbago-blue formed the pictorial wrappings
of the two 'maids. Later Mrs. R. B. Orchard
hostessed at Sargent’s in Market-street.
A wedding served with good music, beauti-
fully tbned flowers and artistic frocking
filled St. Mark’s with light and grace at the
week-end. The bride was Beryl Saxton, of
Bellevue Hill, and the bridegrooip Ivan
Stewart, of Strathfield. Under the forceful
fingers of Lindley Evans, who is Ivan’s
brother-in-law, the organ pealed out _ the
Wedding March in great style. The bride’s
cousin Vera Corbett kept the musical
balance of the contract even by raising her
voice in a wedding hymn. Ivory and pink
chiffons, girdled with pearls, and a billowy
pink tulle train were notable ingredients in
Beryl’s attire, while white heather posies
kept her veil in place. Two ’maids, their
pink georgettes clashing with silver fringe
and rhinestones, followed the bride. Chilled
drinks and warm congratulations were dis-
tributed in Farmer’s smoke-room.
Nancy Munro, only daughter of the Hugh
Munros, of Keera, Bingara, has booked St.
Stephen’s for November 23. Incidentally,
there will be a wedding with A. Stratford
Nivison. Dancing and toasts will follow at
the Rose Bay Golf Club.
Teams of life-savers are being despatched
to country districts, where the enthusiasts
will give demonstrations. Organiser Mrs.
Osborne England goes ahead to prepare the
way for them. The towns on the visiting
list ore Goulburn, Orange. Bathurst, Forbes,
Wellington, Mudgee and Gilgandra. The big
idea, of course, is the establishment of a
club in each centre.
With the ghastly incentive of the day
before’s tragedy in their minds, the Royal
Life Saving Society’s members rallied in
force to the Australia last Friday. The party
had been planned some weeks before, but now
the tea-drinking passed into a high resolve to
spread the knowledge of life-saving through-
out the State. Mrs. Augustus James, whose
Judge has just retired from the presidency,
had the gold brooch of the society pinned in
her ensemble by Kelso King, who said the
appropriate word about seed well sown and
duty done. The exchange of posies and bou-
quets was widespread, and it seemed in the
end that the only ones who hadn’t received
a rose to pin in their hair was Kelso King,
the president, and secretary Walker.
The uneven hem has been the forerunner
of general one-sidedness. Some of the new-
est afternoon frocks have one long, tight
sleeve, but the other arm is to be clothed
only in its. own skin. This sudden shooting
out of a bare arm has a rather Roman-toga
effect. Fringes, too (fringes made of infini-
tesimal rice beads and of rolled strands of
the material of the frock are again in) have
to be unbalanced; they contrive, even when
black, to impart a cubist look to an other-
wise simple frock. Skirts which dip at the
back—reminiscent of Dorothy Draggletail of
the nursery rhyme—are worn with pride by
newly-returneds from Europe; and skirts
that are knee high on the left and ankle
length on the right are among the forecasts.
Also it is to be noted that the lily-and-rose
complexion has gone out in favor of a gipsy-
like coloring. But for the moment Sydney
prefers wide hats and chiffon sunshades.
One of the newest fads is to have your
morning handbag made of the soft felt of
which the smart wearer’s still übiquitous
small hat is made. These bags have wide
mouths, are often not fitted with pockets, and
are finished off with ringed tortoiseshell or
ebony handles. English women are having
these businesslike sacks made from the tweed
or kasha of their tailor-made, and this isn’t
a bad idea for a smar’t accessory to Sydney’s
next winter or top coat.
Mrs. Crawford Vaughan, wife of the
South Australian ex-Premier, died at the end
of last week. The gifted lady, a sister of
Clarence Goode, one of her husband’s col-
leagues, belonged to an old S. Australian
family whose leanings were literary ana
philanthropic. She wrote pretty well her-
self, and was given an 0.8. E. for her war
work. Iler ill-health drove her and her very
devoted husband to the Blue Mountains some
time ago.
Now even the Fairfaxes have succumbed
to the lure of the cabaret. At the afternoon
organised to re-shingle The Barn, the head-
quarters of the Mosman Boy Scouts, Miss
Charles Fairfax was enthroned at one of
three big tables, every woman around her a
kinswoman within the first, second or third
section of the Act. But even the shadow
of the S. M. Herald did not deter the
family group from turning an eager ear to
the wireless report of the Cup, which at
half-past three was the breathless excitement
of the afternoon. The wife of new Minister
for Health Richard Arthur was active as
a vice-president; Enid Gale kept the cash-
register, and Miss Irving-Cummins was
metaphorically handed a laurel wreath for
her work as secretary. A small child was
blown about the room like a rose-leaf on a
zephyr of dance-music. Daphne Dean, in a
Mexican straight-brimmed sailor, sat and
watched some of her pupils tread a measure,
and M.L.A. Marks gave the uplift of his
presence to the cause of these lion-cub inviu-
cibles, who are known as Lord Forster’s Own.
The group of young things who ran the
dance on the Malabar to help furnish the
new Welfare Centre for Sydney’s Deaf and
Dumb were rewarded by a stilly night and
an amazingly good attendance considering it
was Cup Week. The ship, which had been
lent by the Burns-Philp Co., lay nice and
convenient at No. 5, Circular Quay—just
next the wharf that the departing American
boats snow under broken strands of
streamers. The Malabar was furnished with
the usual canopy of bunting, unusual black-
and-white check streamers (they’re the com-
pany’s colors) and a cargo of loud speakers
(no—no# girls!), and all went merry as a
marriage bell. The president of the com-
mittee was Mrs. J. McCreadie; Ina Grace,
Josie Holmes and Clare Davis were the sec-
retaries, and May Matchett and Grace Jewell
the treasurers. Mrs. Gore-Jones, who is the
organising secretary for the society, smiled
on the good work from the glitter of gold
sequins.
Travellers on the Pacific will miss a friend
through the death of Captain Showman. The
captain had been in charge of the Niagara
since the retirement of the veteran Rolls, and
his death, after a short illness, is all the
sadder because he had been married only a
couple of voyages ago.
It’s a far cry from a transport bound for
France to Alice Springs, and the seasons
have turned many times since the year 1918.
But that was the place and the time when
Clifford Peel, a young medical student from
Inverleigh, wrote the first article pointing
out the practicability of flying doctors. Now
he lies dead in France, but the word he
wrote is a living word, and at Easter, 1928,
the Australian Inland Mission will com-
mence its Aerial Medical Service to the
people of the Never Never. The Service will
be run with Cloncurry as a base, and in
conjunction with the Queensland and North-
ern Territory Air Service (Quantas). The
Mission has 'funds in hand to test its experi-
ment for one year with one doctor, one pilot
and one ’plane; and the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment has undertaken to pay half the
machine’s running expenses. The agony of
mind this will save the settlers in such
places as Oodnadatta, Port Augusta, Alice
Springs and the Gulf Country generally it is
hard for us who live around the corner from
hospitals and doctors to imagine. The doc-
tor who will have this mere 250,000 square
miles of practice can claim to be the most
widely-known medical man in Australia.
The scheme is humanitarian on a gargan-
tuan scale. The Australian Inland Mission
has made it practicable. It is up to Aus-
tralia to supply the feathers for the wings
of health to fly with.
The recital given at King’s Hall by pianist
Beryl Aveling has resulted in a cheque for
£6B 12s. being forwarded to the Deaf and

"Nothing ever does me so much good

Flemington looked its best on Oaks day,
loses, yellow pansies and purple violas making
brilliant patches of color amid tlie verdant
lawns. The G.G. and Lady Stonehaven were
there, her Ex. topping a black and white
floral chiffon gown and a pointed fox fur with
a grey felt hat of aviator mode. The State
Governor and Lady Somers, she in black and
white gown and millinery, arrived shortly
before the principal race, accompanied by
Lady Caroline Agar and the Davidsons.
General 11. Grimwade and his wife joined
the party at afternoon tea. Most women
took a chance with the weather, and there
was a fair display of summery attire of
georgette or lace. Navy blue was much
favored, and several beautifully-cut garments
of this hue, filmy and uneven of hem, were
seen. Black and white effects and green of
various shades were also popular. Scarlet
millinery was again to be seen, and a white
georgette frock, with embroidery of red and
the same lined hat and shoes, was quite in
the right spirit. The new straw hats are, in
weave, very like interlining, but though
rather fancied they have not dethroned the
Bangkok millinery. Mrs. Eric Harrison (she
was Roma Clarke) topped a black lace gown
with a jade-green hat. Mona Officer’s black
and white spotted frock was worn with a
black hat. Mrs. H. Riggall brightened an
all-black get-up with cherries on her hat
brim.
A cool, languorous zephyr stirred the rose
petals at Flemington on the final day of the
Cup meeting, and favorites for once in a way
ran as their backers expected them to, so
that everyone was happy except Isaac
McShortodds. The attendance was not so
overwhelming as on the other three days, and
pretty gowns had a better chance of being
seen and admired. The lawns looked a bit
the worse for wear, as was only natural after
the over-running they had had, but the roses
and other gay blooms and the stand’s deco-
rations of petunias, Iceland poppies and pan-
sies in wall-boxes were still radiant. The
flowers have been so much admired that the
V.R.G. proposes to build a hothouse or two
to rear more blooms for the adorning of the
buildings. The G.G., Lady Stonehaven and
the Somerses arrived for the second race, the
period of Court mourning having ended. Lady
Stonehaven wore mole grey georgette with a
harmonising hat, white hose and white shoes.
Lady Somers, who looks particularly well in
black and white, kept to her attire of Oaks
day. Lady Caroline Agar changed her sombre
suit of that occasion for a mauve-and-white
traced foulard, a black coat and pandan
straw hat.
Dressing was bright and airy, with plenty
of red to brighten up the numerous navy and
magpie effects. Mrs. Henry Rosenthal’s pearl-
grey georgette gown, embroidered in silver
thread, with same liued soft hat and foot-
wear, was very effective. Mrs. Russel Clarke’s
ecru lace robe had a cape of the same
material with beige chiffon ■ roses round the
neck. Mrs. Percy Chirnside, who was accom-
panied by her prospective daughter-in-law,
Elsa Andrew, featured black georgette and
lace, with a lengthy cape dangling wide
fringe and a black hat. Miss Andrew was
a study in poppy red. The Hackett-Moulden
lady, from Adelaide, wore a fringed gown of
cosmos magenta hue and a hat to match.
Mrs. W. Cameron was smartly turned out
in a matching frock and hat of cigar-brown
tone mingled with beige. Mrs. A. V. Kew-
ney’s ensemble of black and floral crepe de
Chine was topped by a small black hat. Mrs.
Otway Falkiner, Mrs. Mortill, who was
accompanied by Evelyn Moore, of Sydney,
Mrs. Harry Whiting and Mrs. Jim Fairbairn
also sported attractive toilettes.
On Oaks night, at a time when most race-
goers were thinking of bed, limousines and
taxis in scores were parking outside the
Green Mill, where the Tallis lady was hold-
ing a midnight frolic to help the finances of
the Grosvenor Auxiliary of St. Vincent’s
Hospital. Jazz, with interludes of song, ex-
hibition dances and so forth, made up part
of the programme; but the most exciting fea-
ture of'the jollo was mechanical horse-racing.
Riders had to pay a mounting fee of £5, but
there was no difficulty in finding amateur
jockeys for the 10 life-size wooden horses.
The steeds were propelled by. the riders, who
actuated treadles, and merriment ran high
Avhen the horses skimmed over the ballroom
floor, and rose higher when some of the riders
forgot to keen going and caused a block. The
Tivoli sent some vaudeville entertainers.
Marie Burke and Warde Morgan sang duets,
clowns from Wirths’ Circus capered gleefully,
the 10 society maidens who form the Em-
bassy ballet danced, and the Totem Boys and
some others helped to keep the guests amused
till nearly daybreak. Amongst those who
enjoyed the fun were the Roger Thomsons
and daughter Kathleen, Mrs. George Bow-
cher, the Howard Jolly couple, Dr. Bartolim
and the Ivan Gutmanns.
The Australian Club's ball was a particu-
larly well-staged affair. With the aid of
rainbow draperies, green transparencies,
colored lights and roses a sunshine-after-rain
effect was achieved. White and pink gladioli
were banked on the staircase, and in the.
supper-room mounds of strawberries and
masses of roses made a cheery show. The
club’s president, A. O. Henty, aided by his
sister Beatrice, who held a posy of lilies of
the valley against a pale-green gown that
sparkled with crystal, gave greeting to the
guests. Lady Caroline Agar, robed in black
ninon and lace, and Mrs. E. H. Davidson,
wearing clouds of grey chiffon, were the only
feminine representatives of State Government
House. The Elder lady was there with a
gleam of silver upon a gown of purple velvet.
Many of the dresses worn had been seen
before—mute testimony to _ the effect tins
cancellation of v.-r. festivities during Cup
week had on the glad-rags trade. But there
were scores of debs., who had prepared for
a coming-out at Federal Government House,
and gave their pretty frocks their first
outing at the A.C. tripping. The T. A.
Tabart couple’s daughters, Pixie, all in white
and silver, and Edna, wearing covering of
primrose hue, were of this battalion; also
Sylvia Knox, clad in white and silver with
a shimmer of pink. Guests got somewhat of
a scare when Mrs. Lyster Jackson, mother of
Ilylda McCardel, well known in the hunting
world, collapsed suddenly and was taken a
near-by hospital. Bulletins circulated _ the
following day relieved her friends of anxiety.
Members of the Commonwealth Club
and their friends danced at Bibron’s on
Friday night, when the club colors —dark
and light blue and gold—mingled with the
other decorations. Among the fair guests
were Mrs. Frank Stogdaie and her daughter
Lucy, the latter with a large red bow on
a black frock; Mrs. W. Nankivell, in pink
splashed with sequins; Bessie Cuming,
her green apparel sparkling with silver;
Irene Teague, in a confection of crimson and
silver; Mrs. Kenyon, Mrs. Percy Henry,
Mrs. R. H. Morton, Mrs. C. Allen and Jean
Spowers.
Though Ethel Osborne is not native-born
slie has proved such a useful citizen that
she deserves
the title of
good Austra-
lian. The wife
o f Professor
Osborne, who

siology at the

a medical
degree, and
shows a brass
plate in Col-
lins-street. She
took u p her
medical studies
after marriage,
and went
through while
caring for her
husb and, a
.home and a
family. Two
years ago she
went to Am-
sterdam as Australian delegate to the first
International Medical Congress on Indus-
trial Accidents and Diseases; and she takes
a great interest in the Emily McPherson
School of Domestic Economy. The picture

The “Student Prince” drew a big audience
to His Majesty’s on Saturday night
and the show went well. Even con-
firmed first nighters were thrilled, though
—or was it because? —there was no jazz-
band and no ballet. Beppie de Vries wore
several charming peasant dresses, and
Millie Engler, as the Grand Duchess Anas-
tasia, moved in the centre of wide-spreading
crinoline skirts, her tall silk hat supporting
white plumes. White, lemon and lime tones
were blended in her first robe, and another
was a confection of vivid blue and gold. Adele
Crane, as Princess Margaret, also wore
crinolines and created a stir with an outfit
of blue chiffon velvet, the coat bordered with
ermine and the poke-bonnet feather-adorned.
There were flowers for all the principal
ladies at the curtain. The Robert Linton
couple with their neice Elaine Linton, Mr.
and Mrs. Philip Nunn, Mrs. Colin Fraser,
Mayor Morell and his lady, Mrs. K. Mc-
Cleland and Mrs. Percy Chirnside were in
the forefront on the first night.
Austral Salonites at their latest gathering
entertained Countess Filippini, Carmencita
Mascagni and other members of the Italo-
Australian Grand Opera Company at tea.
The Robinson lady was a guest, and Mrs.
(; A Hunter and Mrs. A. W. Wade were
hostesses. Mrs. Hunter read a paper on the
work of Dorothy Mackellar, and Mrs. it.
Reynolds Lewis played some ot her own
pianoforte compositions.
“Cavalleria Rusticana” presented a most
attractive blending of colors on Saturday
evening when the curtnin u gntliei"
ing of Sicilian peasants in their Easter
finery. CarmCncita Mascagni as Santuzza,
in a cherry-red frock, braved the dangers
that attend clothing the lower extremities in
that warm hue and Dorothy Mansom, as
Lola wore her rose with distinction; the
rows’ of beads that cascaded from her neck
and the beautifully embroidered apron
bespoke the coquette who understands t.ie
importance of such trifles. The brightest
figure in the house was the baton-wielder,
Countess F'ilippini, in a gown of black
sequins, with a river of moonlight. flowing
round the waistline. Her popularity was
evinced by the load of posies thrust upon
her at the final curtain. Professor Or me
Masson’s slim wife, the Barry Thomson
matron and her doctor, the lately returned
Mrs. Dalrymple and Mrs. May Qumnell
were among the audience.
This is Renie Bartley, who came to this
city from Ballarat and now would fam

mosphere o f

who is now in London. Miss Bartley was
for a while a Repertory player. An influen-
tial committee is helping this ambitious lass.

Another theatrical divorce was recorded
last week. Australian managements, un-
like those of America, don’t regard divorces
as good publicity; and, although Margaret
Bannerman, co-re. when Marie Lolir divorced
her husband a couple of weeks ago, is coining
to Australia next year, her connection with
a divorce suit is not likely to be made the
subject of a flourish of trumpets. In the
case in which a useful Australian actor
shed his matrimonial troubles by divorcing
a lady who no longer desired to share break-
fast with him, the name the actor has
dropped for stage purposes was the only
one mentioned, and no reference was made
to the mummer’s theatrical standing.
Divorces are common in stage circles; as
with other followers of the Bohemian arts,
the second unions of actors and actresses
seem more satisfactory than the initial ven-
tures, “Oh, it’s no wonder they don’t get
on well together,” remarked one stage lady
the other day, apropos a quarrelling pair.
“This is their first experience of being
married.”
When Sir Matthew Nathan retired from
the vice-regal job in Bananaland, General
Harry Chauvel was mentioned as a probable
successor, but the, job went in another direc-
tion. Now it is hinted that Chauvel may
succeed Sir Tom Bridges of S.A., whose term
is near its end. The way, ’tis said, has been
cleared by a discussion which Dominions Sec-
retary Amery had with the Executive when
passing through Adelaide. Brudenell White
is available for the post of Chief of Staff in
case Chauvel vacates it.
John Brownlee, in whose reflected glory
his native Geelong basks, will return with
the laurels won during his season at the
Paris Opera House fresh upon him. He is
to play leading r6les in grand operas to be
staged by the Firm next year. Florence
Austral was asked to take part, too. but
the Melbourne star is bound by London con-
tracts.
Miss E. Cragg, of Launceston, after a halt
in this city which took in some of the ex-
citements of our biggest social outburst, got
aboard a liner and went off in the direction
of Burmah, where she is expected by her
sister, Mrs. James Forrest, now settled in
the land of gongs.
Lorna. younger daughter of the late Dr.
Lionel Selfe Wells, of Maldon, now living
with her mother at Bendigo, has engaged
herself to Robert Hedley Crichton, whose
family address is Banchory, Aberdeen.
The art of Archie Colqulioun as repre-
sented in his first show since his return after
a long sojourn abroad is attracting muon
attention. The exhibition, which is at the
Athena'um Hall, comprises portraits, still-
life pieces and a landscape or two. Fritz
Hart, whose portrait is one of the best on
the walls, said the opening words. Amongst
others in the throng on the opening day were
Mrs. Fritz Hart, John Longstaff, Jessie
Traill, the Maudsley lady, the painter’s
mother, and his married sister, Mrs. Porter.
Some notes from Canberra: —
It came as a surprise to many Australians in
London that Sheila MacDonald, who climbed Kili-
manjaro, was the daughter of Claude MacDonald, the
squatter, and the grand-daughter of a former Vic.
Railway Commissioner. Miss MacDonald inherits a
turn for doing original things from her mother, who,
as Miss Ethel Greene, suddenly astonished Melbourne
society some 30 years ago by accepting an engage-
ment from the Mutual Store management as dress
designer and adviser. She was a fine, tall, handsome,
fair girl, of fluent conversation, and had a room to
herself to interview clients. It rather amused
people to note that she kept her hat on. On her
marriage with Mr. MacDonald she retired into
private life. The Dowager Lady Clarke was a great
friend. Sheila, the daughter, is at present the guest
of Captain Ritchie, the Game Warden of Nairobi,
with whom she has been out shooting lions.
The Amery party arrived on Thursday to find
Canberra’s freshness rather damped—in fact, the
place has been absolutely drenched for several days.
Mrs. Bruce’s idea of holding a garden fete in the
grounds of the Lodge on Thursday afternoon had to
be reconsidered, and a simple afternoon tea-party in
the drawing-room was arranged in Mrs. Amery’s
hono.\
After the Government’s dinner to Mr. Amery,
which was attended by all available members and
Senators and the Federal Capital Commissioners, a
combined session of both Houses was privately con-
ducted in the House of Reps., all entrances to
Strangers’, Press and Distinguished Visitors’ galleries
being locked. The ladies, thus rendered grass-widows
for the night, were entertained at dinner by Mrs.
Bruce.
Lady Augusta Inksip, the wife of the Solicitor-
General, has set out for New York, whence after a
short stay she leaves for Maoriland on a visit to her
brother-in-law and sister, General Sir Charles and
Lady Alice Ferguson, at Government House, Auck-
land. Lady Augusta and Lady Alice are sisters of
Lord Glasgow and Dorothy Lady Cranbrook.
Dion Titheradge’s play “The Crooked Billet’’ is
postponed for a while owing to Dennis Eadie s
retirement from the cast due to unforeseen circum-
stances. There has been no misunderstanding between
the various heads, and Alexander Rea is still the
producer.
Another actress to marry into a titled family will
be Edythe Baker, whose engagement to Gerald d’Erl-
anger is just announced. He is the son of Baron and
Baroness d’Erlanger, the banking family, and is a
tall, fine-looking young roan. Miss Baker is the
bright star of “One Dam’ Thing After Another” at
the Pavilion, and is socially very popular. She was
acquainted with her fiance’s parents before she met
him. One of her songs, “My Heart Stood Still,” is
such a hit that 20,000 discs of the record have been
sold. In addition, she is a good pianist and has an
attractive personality. Charles Cochrane recently
refused T2OOO for the American rights of this song,
and though people gasped with amazement he has
made a better bargain.
A theatrical firm has suddenly dissolved partner-
ship when fortune was smiling serenely. Archie de
Ei er and Clifford Whitley, who have been doing well
with “Blue Skies” at the Vaudeville, have separated.
Both started as journalists.
Among arrivals for the winter will be the Pitoeffs,
Georges and his wife Ludmilla, who are described as
the most interesting theatrical couple on the Con-
tinent. Not so long ago they were quite unknown
and penniless, but a season in Paris set the great
salons discussing them.
Harry Tighe, an Australian author, is having a
comedy produced at the “Q” this week, “Old Mrs.
Wiley.” He has another play to his credit, “Open
Spaces,” produced at the same theatre some time
back.
Lady Athlumney, whom Australians will remember
as Margery Boan, is entertaining friends at her
residence in Somerville, Co. Meath. She and Lord
Athlumney have been travelling in America and
have only just returned, going straight to their Irish
home.
H. D. Mclntosh gave a speed-the-parting-guest
luncheon to Pavlova last Friday at the Carlton, and
introduced a new cocktail of his own invention. It
set everyone asking how to do it. Five-sixths vodka,
one-sixth French vermouth and a dash of grenadine.
Another dancer of note has set ladies of fashion
who are eager to preserve their slimness practising—
not a two-step—but a 40 pirouette on one toe. This
is Madame Nemehinova, whose record was 39 times
on one toe, but she has now achieved the 40 she
set her heart on.
Two Australian singers have had signal successes
this week. Florence Austral sang “Ocean, Thou
Mighty Monster!” at a Beecham concert, better than
it had been sung this century, but she was not so
happy in “Charmant Oiseau.” At a Palladium
concert in a Wagner programme, Horace Stevens, the
bass-baritone, distinguished himself. He is the new
Wotan of the British National Opera Company.
Mrs. J. Thornton Tweddle, a member of Mel-
bourne’s Twenty Painters’ Society, is attracting
notice with her exhibition of Australian and travel
sketches at the Arlington Gallery. One of her
strong points is a sense of color and color values,
and this she makes apparent even in her slightest
sketches.

Why
Benger’s
for Aged
Persons .
WHEN, by weight of years, digestive
powers become enfeebled, and the
vital elements are not absorbed from
ordinary food, Benger’s is an agreeable
and abundant source of nutrition.
No Food is so acceptable and so
entirely suitable in old age as Benger’s,
nor so completely strength-giving.
A Doctor writes: —
‘I have much pleasure in testifying: to the
value of your Food in the diet of old age, and
in dyspepsia and convalescence. I could not do
without it in my practice.”
Food
is always made with fresh new milk,
which it enriches and converts into a
delicious food cream.

The Goodwins went to Toowoomba to
meet Sir Arthur and Lady Lawlcy. Sir
Arthur governed Westralia in 1901, and he
has since been Lieut.-Governor of the Trans-
vaal and Governor of Madras. The Gov-
ernor’s own coach fetched them from the bor-
der and Colonel Campbell was with their
Queensland Exes, at Toowoomba, where the
Mayor and Mayoress of that city and the
president of the Chamber of Commerce
greeted them.
Lady Goodwin went to A r era Morcom and
Eric John’s concert, taking Mrs. de Witt.
Batty with her. Vera Morcom, who always
looks charming, has improved wonderfully
since her trip to the Cold Countries, and Eric
John has been likened to Backliaus at the
piano. Floral gifts testified to the audience s
appreciation.
On Cup day Mrs. Ross Munro arranged a
benefit afternoon for the Crfeclie and Kinder-
garten at Ross Roy, with bridge and mah-
jongg tables on thei verandahs, and afternoon
tea ’mid bowls of roses on the lawn. Flowers
were sold to help the fund, and the recep-
tion-rooms were beautifully decorated with
spring blossomry. A description of the big
race in Melbourne was received by radio.
Lady Goodwin and Mrs. N. A. Campbell
were amongst the throng, and Mrs. Jack
Chandler helped her mother to entertain.
There was a big All Hallowe’en party at
Lennon’s, when spooks and black cats and
other mysteries were lures. Fortune-telling
and crystal-gazing were part of the pro-
gramme and many fates were predicted. Jhe
ballroom and palm-court were done up in
orange and black, and there was a jazz
orchestra. Mrs. Jack Cain organised the
affair to aid the Loretto Convent Home, She
wore ivory mariette. Phyllis and Ray and
Frank Thomas and Joyce Griffiths danced,
and cabaret numbers were given by the
Follies, from Cremorne. Judge Blair and
his wife, the Buchanan Steeles, the Arthur
Piersons, Captain and Mrs. Leslie, Mrs. A.
P. Greenfield, Minty Barry and Tessa Read-
ing were amongst the crowd.
Prof. Cumbrae Stewart, who was wel-
comed by Mrs. Morton Tweedie, opened the
Arts and Crafts ' exhibition in the Empire
Chambers. Mrs. Reid exhibited choice book-
binding, an “Arabian Nights” _ in Persian
morocco with Arabic lettering being specially
beautiful. Batik scarves were shown by
Kate Armstrong, and Mrs. Scott-h letcher
brought fine beaten brass. John Flower lent
his collection of bookplates. The show is an
interesting one.
The Albion Thousand was not so well
attended as usual this year, though the
grounds are looking very pretty just now.
Mrs. Stanley Chapman was m navy and
ivory foulard, Mrs. E. A. Cullen wore blue
crepe de Chine, and Cecily Cadell-Gainck
was in lemon-tinted linen.
The Eric Annin gs had a garden party for
the funds of St. Margaret’s. Mrs. Alining
wore almond-green. The pupils of the school
gave country dances, and flowers and sweets
were sold.

The W.A. Music Teachers’ Association
entertained musical heads from three capitals
the other night—Prof. E. II. Davies Direc-
tor of Music at the Elder Con., Adelaide;
Prof. Bernard Heiuze, of the Melbourne
Uni. Con.; and Professor A. D. Ross of
Perth Uni. Music and musical talk with a
bite and sup and a welcome to Mr. Craft,
a member who lias just returned from Lon-
don, filled in a pleasant evening.
Some 250 guests attended the Vander-
velde-Samuel wedding, which took place in
the Y A.L. Hall, the ceremony being accord-
ing to Hebrew rites. Dr. Goldstein, May?r
Franklin and ex-Mayor William Lathlam
proposed toasts at the breakfast, lhe bride
wore white and gold. Mrs. Samuel s artistic
toilette was of hyacinth-blue with ostrich
feather embellishments.
The Rose Show in the Town Hall was
opened by Governor Campion, and attracted
large crowds. The exhibition demonstrated
that roses can be grown to perfection even
on Perth’s sandy soil when water is plentiful.
This is Ydonea Dale, who recently made

The hostesses at the Repertory Club’s
latest afternoon were, Miss Ambrose and
Miss Tivey, who recited. There were songs
by Mrs. ,T. N. Thomson, Beth Johnston and
Marcia Hodges, and tea and cakes for all.
Mrs. J. N. Thomson, who is a tower of
strength where charity entertainments are
concerned, is busy now with the Public H°s
pital Appeal; and, with a small company of
artists, is making a tour o f v armua distucrs
giving concerts. She herself is accompanist,
and other members of the party are Lylie
Hocking, Alice Connop, Gladys Hoskm» and
Mavis Epstein.
Mrs. Ernest Foster, wife of the late Dean
of Perth, returns to England shortly, via
South Africa, and has been farewelled by
church people. , .

TASMANIA.
Hobart.
It was a disappointment to learn that Mrs.
Amery was not to accompany her husband
on his visit to Tassie, but the lady would
hardly have had time to breathe had she tol-
lowed the itinerary arranged. A
dinner, a vice-regal dinner and a burned tnp
to Waddamana, with a glimpse ot one coun-
try home (that of the Alec Reids, of Ratho),
and the distinguished guest was whisked olt
to the mainland again.
Commodore O. R. Tinning and his
daughter Jean entertained the official party
at the Royal Yacht Club’s ball at the Con-
tinental where, to give a nautical flavor to
the ballroom, a ship’s bell was hung over
the orchestra, and sea time was struck dur-
ing the function. Jean Tinning s frock ot
oyster white was climbed over uy
in two shades of vivid pink, brightened still
more by a design of sequins and silver beads.
A stuffed pelican was among the decorations,
and photographs of celebrated yachts were
hung on the walls.
It takes courage in these days to give a
poetry reading, in cold blood in the middle ot
the afternoon,
but that is
what Mary
S h a r 1 a n d,
whose photo-
graph is here
show n, did,
with eminent
success, last
week. Some
years ago Miss
Sharlaud went
to London,
where she
studied voice
production at
the Albert Hall
School of Elo-
c u t i o n, and
since coming
back to her
native land she
has taught the
young idea
how to speak
its own language. The reading was the
first of a series, Wordsworth and Coleridge
being drawn upon. Next time there will be
extracts from Shelley and Keats.
Margaret O’Grady opened the new basket-
ball court at Glemes College amid much
excitement on the part of the contending
teams —Clemes and the Collegiate School.
Five basket-ball clubs formed themselves into
a guard of honor along the drive, at the end
of which stood Mrs. Blakeby, secretary and
umpire. Miss O'Grady had heen an entlmsi-
astic piayer of the game in the Old Countiy,
and showed that she knew how to handle the
ball. „ .
Cecilia John, who has wandered far from
her native city during the last few years is
paying a short visit to her relatives here.
She has taken up Dalcroze eurhythmies as
her main study, and has been teaching m
the Cold Country.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
Muriel Starr and Mrs. W. MacDonald
have been entertained by the English-bpeak-
in„ Union—a small affair at which only
members of the reception committee were
present. Mrs. MacDonald, now living m
San Francisco, is one of the Delprat clan,
and, like other members of the family, lias
more than the average allowance of brains.
After proving herself a brilliant pianist she
turned her attention to medicine and studied
at Berkeley Uni., San Francisco. In Aus-
tralia her brother did much the same thing,
only liis first love wus rnGtallurgicul
chemistry. ,
There has been festivity at the Women s
Club, too, its guest being Charlotte Gnveli,
who contributed a song or two to the pro-
gramme arranged in her honor. Adelaide
Mietlike, the club’s president, bade her wel-
come in a neat little speech.
Widespread sympathy has gone to Craw-
ford Vaughan at the news of the death ot his
wife. She was in the forefront of feminist
movements here long before such movements
were tolerated, made a host of child friends
through her books, and in the days of the ,
war was a forceful and untiring speaker on
recruiting and loan campaign platforms. She
was born on Canowie station, of which her
father, the late Thomas Goode, was manager
for many years.
From England comes news of the Darnley
Naylors, definitely settled in his native Cum-
berland and with no thought of returning to
Australia. Dr. H. Heaton, who left his
lectureship in economics here for a similar
job in Canada, has crossed the border to
Minnesota, where he is lecturer in economic
history.
The Y.M.C.A. is to build itself a home.
The site selected is on the eastern side of
Victoria-square —a block now occupied by
a motor establishment and a house built by
the late Dr. Charles Todd.
The Keith Angases, who have been tour-
ing Europe, are now in Cairo and are due
home early in the year. The Edwin Cro-
ziers were among the Ormonde’s passengers,
and the Cecil Brays will be back for
Christmas.
Charlotte Grivell, with Ariel Shearer as
her accompanist and Carlyle Jones as ’cellist,
attracted a large audience to her home-com-
ing recital in the Town Hall, and showed,
that she’d made full use of her three years
as an Elder Scholar. Her voice has mel-
lowed and deepened, and her enunciation is
excellent. A bracket from French classics
was the outstanding item of the evening.

THE INKY WAY.
“Ilennessy”: “Hotham” (B. 27/10/’27)
says that the United Press (Melb.) controls
about _ a dozen daily and weekly journals
including a boys’ paper. If that is Pals
he has missed a funeral. On a dark night
a few weeks ago a strong boy was given
something in a bag and told to take it up
on the roof and throw it in the river. Pals
has not been heard of since.
l( Riwaka ’: The winning of a newspaper
stunt ’ competition has its perils as well
as its rewards. Narrewillock (Vic.) farmer
landed the Melbourne Herald’s prize for an
agriculturist who had never seen the city,
and he and his family became non-paying
guests of the enterprising daily during the
recent R.A.S. Show. Dad and mum re-
turned to the farm contentedly enough, but
their son and daughter had seen enough to
convince them that a city job is preferable
to farming. So the country loses two more
young people to the bloated city.
“Thespian”: Started in 1903, Sydney's
once-popular Theatre Magazine passed
out last week. It was sold in 1908 by John
Eedy, the Market-street printer, to Mrs.
Fisher for a liver. With the aid of Frank
Ilill she made such a success of her purchase
that in 1912 a part interest in the publica-
tion was disposed of for £l5OO. A company
was formed with Hill, Fisher, Claude
McKay and Syd Day a 3 principal share-
holders. From the first the gifted Frank Hill
was editor until the paper, in 1923, was
bought by Shipping Newspapers, Ltd.
Later editors were Wallace Nelson, Goodie
Reeve and Charlie Jeffries. But the pulse
weakened from the time of Lalla Fisher’s
departure, and the change of the paper’s
title to Just It sounded the death-knell.
During the Hill-Fisher regime the paper
could show an income from ads. and sales of
over £750 an issue.
“Square Jane” : Twelve years have elapsed
since I sent my first paragraph to The Bul-
letin and had the gratification of reading it
in print. This is the second. The par was an
outburst of indignation at being unable to
procure Australian-made woollen stockings
in Sydney. There is no dearth of Aus-
tralian-made silk ones now, and my feet are
just as warm. But the reflection that 1
wore woollen stockings only 12 years ago
convinces me that I picked a really appro-
priate pen-name.
“Rob P.”: “Roma Oil Sensation” was a
recent line in a Brisbane daily’s contents
bill, and there was brisk speculation whether
a gusher had been struck or a few cwt. of
drilling tools had fallen down the bore.
Actually the “sensation” was a very different
one. As a fillip to public interest in Roma's
possibilities a much-placarded motor-car was
to be run about Brisbane on oil fresh from
the bore. Outside the Town Hall the imported
petrol was being ostentatiously drained
from the car’s tank into the gutter to make
room for the local product when someone
threw down a lighted match. They beat the
blaze out somehow, but it made an awful
wreck of the placards.
“Knib”: Talking of Parliamentary gems
(B. 3/11/’27), here are a few from my pri-
vate collection made in the Assembly and
Reps, in Melbourne
Submerged on a pinnacle of materialistic vapor.
Ballarat is the finest city south of the Hemisphere.
The pioneers are passing away. Only yesterday
at the show in my district I missed many of the
old faces I used to shake hands with.
We have listened to rosy pictures and now the
chickens have come home to roost.
The House is in its third year, and soon we’ll
have to face our masters and our mistresses.
I (the Finance Minister) have no Pandora’s box
into which to dip.
The Ministry is playing a game of “heads I
win” and “tails you lose” with a double-headed
penny.
If this Bolshevik movement extends you will wake
up some morning and find yourselves without heads.
We have just returned from the elections and the
ink is scarcely cool.
“Elingarah”: My first literary effort, a
very short story called “Joe,” was sent to
The Bulletin in 1893 or thereabouts. The
response “Will print” thrilled me with
delight, but closely as I scanned every sub-
sequent issue it was all to no avail, and at
last my patience was exhaused. I re-wrote
the story and sent it to the Sunday Times
of that period, which printed it and paid
me five bob. In the next issue of The Bul-
letin “Joe” made his second appearance
within a week. Thereupon I wrote a most
elaborate explanation to the editor, and I
suppose I must have been exonerated from
blame, for I received in reply a postal-note
for 7s. 6d.
“J.T.”: The new writer of the S. M.
Herald’s Federal Gallery notes soon
achieved a large advt. Perkins, Eden-
Monaro’s new member, described as one so
meek that “given suitable robes he would
make the angel of peace look like a lady
with gout and dyspepsia.” complained in
the House that he had been insulted, and
spent nearly a quarter of an hour in abusing
his alleged detractor, quoting, amongst other
things, certain disparaging remarks about
the author of the offending column, which he
said had been made to him by other news-
paper men in the gallery. The upshot of
this was that the gallery crew held a meet-
ing and challenged Perkins to name the men
whom he had vaguely indicated. But the
member for Eden-Monaro did not come
across, contenting himself with reiterating
his detestation of the man who had drawn
comparisons between himself and a dove.
“D.McM.”: In the days when Sydney
wore mutton-chop whiskers the first attempt
was made to establish an Australian maga-
zine—the Australian Magazine, the pro-
moters called it. Its quality can best be
gauged by recalling the names of some of
its contributors —Henry Lawson, Victor
Daley, Rod Quinn, Fred Broomfield, George
Lambert, Fred Lcist, Frank Mahony and
D. 11. Souter w T ere among them—but the
venture soon came to grief on the rocks of
public indifference. The Bulletin’s effort
with the Lone Hand in 1907 was perhaps
the nearest we ever got to establishing a
successful rival to the imported magazine,
but the high cost of production in the end
proved fatal to the venture. In a less ambi-
tious way, Walter .Tago, kindliest of editors,
is still doing his bit with Aussie.

• 4 weeks’ season crowded to the last
night of "The Ringer” was the encourage-
ment for another mystery play, “The Terror ”
•staged at the Sydney Royal on Saturday.
Edgar Wallace, who makes a specialty of
the marrow-freezing line of dramatic goods,
is again responsible. The action starts in
a ward of a prison, where sundry partici-
pants m an outsize gold robbery express
their determination to find the Terror,
the master mind in the nefarious enter-
prise, who has got away with the spoils and
■successfully planted them. The scene then
shifts to the Monkshall Priory, turned into
a guest-house by the impoverished Colonel
Redmayne, an establishment pervaded by
phantom organ music, ghastly cowled forms
appearing at intervals, and other accessories
of a haunted house, including a specially
eerie braiid of shrieking wind laid on outside
at midnight. The Colonel’s daughter, brought
from school to this slavery mansion, implores
her father to give it up; but he, with a pained
expression, tells her it can’t be done. So
they stand by whilst criminals, mostly dis-
guised, and mysterious strangers and (after
the murders start) detectives arrive; and
various people rush distractedly about the
premises appalled by the continuous chain
of bloodcurdling happenings or inexplicable
illusions. Just what the secret is it would
be unfair to disclose; it is sufficient to men-
fron that in the final analysis the list of the
killed includes only those who are better dead,
and that happiness and woalth are sprayed
liberally about the stage.

Maurice Moscovitch hardly finds full scope
for his talents in the task of amiably sham-
ming drunkenness and between whiles exhibit-
ing a capacity for intense sobriety. Not even
a wife would accuse Ferdinand Fane of being
really and truly shot on som.e of the occasions
when he is supposed to be giving that impres-
sion to the occupants of the stage; but the
maintenance of the character through three
acts is a heavy job. Ashton Jarry does most
to sustain the atmosphere of uncanniness, as
the creepy, saturnine butler, Cotton, who
makes soft-footed entrances in moments of
tension. Frederick Forrester’s careful, re-
strained work as William Goodman provides
an. effective contrast to some later forceful
acting; and Patric Curwen vividly presents
the worried Colonel Redmayne. No heroine
ever had a more distressful part than Mary
Redmayne; Eileen Sparks makes her
moments of terror real enough. Mildred
Cottell gives good value as a lady with an
interest in murders, and she had Mary Mac-
gregor as a nice-looking daughter. ’J. R.
Altholwood as a “character” policeman, and
Herbert Leigh as a gaol governor. Nat
Maddison as Soapy Meeks and Richard
Webster as an aggressive and brisk police
superintendent all help “The Terror” along.

A realistic aeroplane smash is worked ipto
the opening of “The Broken Wing” at the
Palace (Sydney), as a sort of introduction
to a pleasing hotch-potch of drama, corned y
and music. Inez Nillera, brought up in Mexico
by an English stepfather with a proper re-
gard for soap, despises her Greaser suitors
even when they are generals, and prays
God for a Gringo husband. When Philip
Marvin’s aeroplane crashes into the roof of
Farley’s dwelling, and precipitates him,
sorely injured, at her feet, she overlooks the
abruptness of his arrival and regards it as
a direct answer to her petition. Marvin’s
smash has caused him to forget most things,
but he retains his proficiency at love-making,
much to the annoyance of the Mexican
army, which is mainly C.iptain Innocencio
Dos Santos. The Mexican is mollified, how-
ever, when he hears from an American
named Sylvestre Cross, who is pottering
about the neighborhood, that Marvin’s
father is a millionaire and there is big
ransom money in him. Cross obligingly
goes away to collect it on the understand-
ing that lie is to have a cut; he returns with-
out the cash but with a lady who claims to be
Mrs. Marvin. This is a little awkward, as
Marvin and Inez have secretly been mar-
ried ; and the third act sees inez passion-
ately declaring that it is no fault of hers if
God has answered her prayers by sending
her a married man. A swift last act clears
up matters to the satisfaction of everybody
except a baflled; and humiliated Mexican army.
* * * *
flea-bitten Mexican army is repre-
sented by Reg Wykeham as General Paufelo
Aguilar, who is constrained to scratch his
back against a doorpost until he is removed
from authority and this insecty life by
Captain Innocencio, played admirably as a
bombastic,. crafty simpleton by Peter Gaw-
thorne; Zillah Bateman does not look very
Mexican in. the part of Inez, but is lively
and romantic. B. N. Lewin is the American
feyivestre Cross, Eardley Turner the ami-
able Englishman Luther Farley, and Ronald
Ward the airman with the lost memory. The
dashing Cecilia of Lilian Douglas, who
poses as the supposed Mrs. Marvin, is good;
Raymond Ellis, orderly to the Mexican army,
sings better than he acts.
“Archie,” the new boarder at the St. James
(Sydney) on Saturday, is a conjugal pacifist
who, even when his. wife stays out all night,
has to be forced into direct action by a
choleric uncle. When at last he is driven
to a mild rumpus, his wife Billie welcomes
the outburst with joy—ownership by a cave-
man being the luck of her life. Uncle George
V\ llloughby, however, is determined upon
divorce, and takes his nephew to a hotel
where he is to compromise himself with a
mercenary lady, the. whole cast following to
the same address in accordance with the
traditions of musical comedy. After that
the story becomes a tale of pink pyjamas,
which are discovered in a lady’s bedroom
and spirited away with confused results, in
the midst of which Archie establishes his
innocence by proving that he never wears
pyjamas, and the people involved in the
various love issues fall into harmonious
couples. The music has a lilting quality,
and there are some excellent ballets, notably
°I} e 111l 11 which an array of parasols is used
effectively, but the comedy wears thin in
places. Jimmy Godden gets a lot of fun out
ot distracted Archie, without ever succeed-
ing in making it a part; and Elsie Prince,
the wife, is merely bright and lively without
being convincing. Charlton Morton con-
tributes some easy and effective work as the
young man who has an axe of his own to
grind in re-uniting Archie and his wife,
Leonard Rich shows agile toes but colorless
acting and Frances Groves does well as
Lady Violet. It is a light evening’s enter-
tainment with a few very good points.

Jim Gerald and Reg Hawthorne, having
absolutely no knowledge about how hotels are
run, enter into a partnership to run one;
tlmy call their ensuing sorrows, which amuse
audiences at Fuller’s Theatre (Sydney)
twice a day “The Troubles of Hector ”
Gem Id has the goods, with a ''""many more
than usually competent to purvey them ; and
the daisy chain of laughter, song and dance
moves forward too quickly to give a glimpse
of the wire holding it together.
Privately screened at the Prince Edward,
"The King of Kings,” Cecil B. de Mille’s
latest venture, showed the movies’ idea of
how the life of Christ should be told. The
picture is magnificent in detail, and rever-
ence for the theme has been carried to the
length of making the actors anonymous, as
far as can be done with faces that have be-
come familiar on the screen. Actually there
is no more irreverence in the portrayal of
“CAROLINE,” AT MELBOURNE
KING’S.
Robert Oldham, K.C., is not so sure he
wants, to marry Caroline, after a ten
years’ courtship (Norman McKinnel
and Irene Vanbrugh).
the Divine figure in film than in paint; a
more valid objection might be raised against
the conversion of a story of beautiful sim-
plicity into the involved pageant which natu-
rally suggests itself to the moving-picture
mind. From a sumptuous palace Mary
dashes off in a chariot drawn by zebras in
pursuit of her handsome lover, Judas
Iscariot, who has allied himself with a wan-
dering carpenter, making a public stir by his
miracles. After that the story becomes a
Bible lesson illustrated with fine pictures
helped out with masses of Jewish people,
soldiery and priests. The pathetic narrative
is worked out with relentless thoroughness,
even to the crucifixion and the suffering on
the cross; but the film might have ended
there. Apparently world-famous paintings
have been carefully studied; “The Last Sup-
per is faithfully produced with moving
characters.

Too much star is the fault of “Wedding

A film that starts well but loses its them*
in wild-horse gallops and pistol shots is “Tli e
Devil’s Saddle,” which shares honors with
After Midnight” at Hoyt’s. “Camille,” after
a run of 11 weeks at the Piccadilly, is
announcing its departure. Another old stage
laughter-raiser, “The Wrong Mr. Wright,”
has been done in the film; but every picture
should tell its story, and this relies too
much upon captions. It is being shown at
the Haymarket.

The story of “The Student Prince” who
falls m love with the innkeeper’s niece at
Heidelberg found instant favor at His
Majesty’s (Melb.) on Saturday night. The lead-
ing man, Frank Liddy, is a regular Prince
Charming; with him are retained 16 of the
male chorus, which was the outstanding fea-
ture of the piece in Sydney. It was an excel-
lent first night, and a visiting English jour-
nalist pronounced it 70 per cent, better than
the London production. The gentlemen of
the chorus, 30 in all, sing their rollicking
college songs with such vim that the audience
is almost moved to make it a community
warble. The ladies in their pretty peasant
costumes or their crinolines and curls
are equally tuneful. Beppie de Vries
makes an adorable Ivathie, whether coy or
pathetic, and Adele Crane is a fairy-tale
princess in her feathered millinery. Arthur
Stigant scores in the role of the Prince’s
valet; and Vera Spaull has a good fit in the
part of the maid Gretchen. Hedley Hall is
a meritorious Dr. Engel, and John Forde
gives a clever old-man study as Toni. Pro-
ducer Blackman and Minnie Hooper, who
arranged the dances, must also be given
honorable mention.
“Cavalleria Rustieana” and "I Pagliacci’'
formed the bill of fare at Melb. Princess on
Saturday evening. As the rustic Lothario
who casts too warm an eye on his neigh-
bor's wife, Enrico Rigattieri shared vocal
honors with Carmencita Mascagni as San-
tuzza. Two Adelaide girls, Dorothy Mansou
and Elsie Woolley, were in the cast, the
former a most seductive temptation as Lola.
Countess Filippini received a special round
of applause for the orchestral work in the
famous Intermezzo. In “Pagliacci” Antonio
Molinari showed real power as the tormented
husband who finally stabs his wife and her
lover. Carmencita Mascagni was his Nedda,
and Ercole Filippini gave a convincing study
of the revengeful clown. Among the other
offerings of the week “Faust” was a highly
creditable performance; the Mepliistopheles
of Alessandro Barbares being splendidly
devilish and his singing good. Another young
Australian, Mattie Pank, won praise as Leo-
nora in “II Trovatore,” in which Elsie AVool-
ley was a remarkably good gipsy. “Lucia di
Lammermoor” and “Carmen” (Saturday)
are the new operas of this week.

At the Melbourne Royal Anita Loos, the
recorder of male preference for the blonde,
has collaborated with John Emmerson in
“The Whole Town’s Talking” to throw out
another downright generalisation about
things that sway her own sex in matters of
the heart. They lean, one learns, towards
the gentleman who has had an affair with a
film star. ’Tis a supposed entanglement
with the dashing Norma Lythe (Marie
Burke) that rouses feminine interest in the
extremely dull but virtuous Chester Binney,
admirably personated by R. Barrett Len-
nard.
“Caroline,” which is mostly Irene Van-
brugh, is smiling through at the King’s
Theatre (Melb.) at a winner’s pace. When
wee Dion Boucicault soliloquises, as Dr.
Cornish, on middle age, every fading woman
in the audience sees herself as she is, and
some who haven’t begun to fade glimpse
themselves in the future. It is a tense
moment, relieved by the tearful Caroline’s
suggestion that the medico won’t charge her
for the visit.

notes that rise from, the deepest of bass to
the highest of falsetto, are still the best of
Melb. Tivoli’s turns. Brown and Willa are
clever people who produce landscape, still-
life or portraiture with any odd bits of
material. A mathematical bird who answers
to the name of the Colonel is the leading
flier in the winged company of Harmstron’s
Cockatoos.

Melbourne art:—
The water-colors of Albert Collins at the New
Gallery would not be without charm of color and
arrangement if the quality of tone were not so often
absent. In trying to choose between the two stools
of realism and romantic feeling the artist frequently
sits on the floor. His handling is solid, but it is
sometimes less the solidity of earth than the heavi-
ness of pigment. A view of ■ a rosy distant city is
the most satisfying.
It would be difficult to be polite to the work
ascribed to Mrs. E. J. Horwood at the Sedon Gal-
leries. As this paper hates being rude, it will
now proceed to change the subject.
The exhibition of Archie D. Colquhoun claims
attention at the Athenaum Gallery. A one-time
pupil of Max Meldrum, he studied in Paris for some
years. Sincerity and definite aim are apparent in most
of the 69 canvases. His portraits are extraordinarily
good likenesses, as opposed to merely pretty pictures,
the most notable being Fritz Hart, a military nurse,
and a self-portrait, “The Mandarin Coat.” His
still-life studies are mainly flowers or fruit set in
oriental bowls or jars. The Meldrum influence is
more apparent in the landscapes; here the values
are a trifle uneven, but the best are very good.
The Adelaide Royal is closed, and
Muriel Starr, at the Prince of Wales, has
the dramatic field to herself, with no
opposition ahead until Pat Hanna’s Diggers
open their summer season at the Garden
Theatre on Saturday week under J.S.W.
auspices. Muriel has proved the success of
stock drama in Adelaide; on Monday she
registered the 100th performance of her
present run with “Cheating Cheaters.” The

The popularity of the Double
Chevron in England—a country
which demands, above all else, high
quality and honest workmanship—
was demonstrated when a road
census showed that the third largest
number of cars represented were
Citroens. The British Citroen has
been accepted by the British public
on its merits. And what better
guide is there than public accept-
ance? CJ Citroen has proved its
economy, its comfort, its outstanding
reliability under typical Australian
conditions. Ask your local agent to
demonstrate Citroen to you.

In Queen §>treet, Brisbane
Robert Roberts Revue Cos. lias been scoring
a success with “Helter Skelter” at the
Majestic. At West’s Pictures “What Price
dorr is a comedy with a war setting,
and the York shows Reginald Denny in
. as A ail d I urious,’ one of those pictures
m which you travel a mile a minute in com-
pany with the hero. “Too Many Crooks”
have been occupying the Wondergrapli
-theatre, with something more educative ami
nearer home in the filmed demonstration of
lhe Newcastle Steel Works.” The Grand
has been supplying thrills in a flying film
Iliree Miles Up.” Dame Nellie Melba
blows into the culture zone this week and
gives two concerts for the people, to-night
and Saturday.
Two water-colorists:—
Although B. E. Minns has four oils, including a
delicately done view of Narrabeen Lake, in "his
exhibition at the Fine Art Gallery, King-street,
Sydney, the show is mainly water-colors, with a group
of four aboriginal portraits as a special feature.
The artist gives the girl in No. 5 something- that
is very like comeliness, and the eyes are shown with
remarkable sympathy—Minns is still incomparable
in his handling of black brother and sister. The
rest of the pictures are sunshine views, a great
many of Sydney Harbor, rendered with unerring sure-
ness. “Glimpse of the Harbor” shows the artistry
of his style; there is a harmonious contrast in the
foreground of tree-shaded fence with the distant
view of sunlit city. In pictures like “From Forest
Depths” he strikes an imaginative, poetical note that
is particularly pleasing.
George Bell is another skilled water-colorist who
lacks the imaginative gleam of Minns, and is
growing careless and casual in some of his work.
In at least a few of his pictures at the Grosvenor
Galleries a lack of finish is noticeable. “Coming
Storm” is skilfully done; and “Evening Glow” and
“Winter” are pleasing pictures.
S.V.D. We were doing a well-known
illusion trick. After being “hypnotised,”
laid on a table and covered with a sheet, a
figure responds to the magician’s passes and
rises into mid-air. A hoop is apparently
pa ?f e j round the floating body, the sheet is
pulled away—and the figure has vanished.
The black back-curtain we used for this
illusion was not wide enough for the stage,
so we lowered another curtain a few feet
behind it. When the sheet was lifted to
cover him, my brother (who was tlm
figure) had to roll off the table, get through
a concealed opening in the black curtain,
crawl under the second curtain and walk off.
Meanwhile I, off stage, had to operate an
apparatus which lowered a wire model, and
then raised it, covered with a sheet, to mid-
air. The audience remained spellbound till
the figure reached mid-air. Then it roared.
After getting through the black curtain my
brother had forgotten to crawl under the
second curtain ; and in leisurely walking off
the stage had shown himself to the audience.
It was the comedy act of the evening.
“Hamfat”: By rough estimate “Rose
Mane has collected for the Firm well over a
quarter of a million pounds. Staged in Syd-
ney on May 29 of last year it has been run-
ning ever since, with only odd days missed
m travelling. By the time it finished in
Sydney on February 20 there had been 317
performances; the Melbourne season added
226; and the 5J weeks’ season in Adelaide,
which ended on October 1, put another 46
performances to the tally—589 to the date
when the bright show commenced to do W.A.
There are still new worlds to conquer in
Queensland and M L.; and with the certainty
of payable return seasons in the bigger cities
it looks as if the show might approach a
record of 1000 performances.
“Wood’s Green” (Bond.) : Edith Evans
is to appear with Leon M. Lion at Wynd-
ham’s in “The Lady-in-Law,” from the
French of Louis Verneuil and Georges Birr.
It is a comedy of a wife so taken up with
her profession that the husband doesn’t
count. With Edith as an actress it is the
salary that doesn’t count. The gifted and
hard-working young man gave up West
End chances to become proficient in Shak-
speare at the “Old Vic.” One of her early
engagements was as understudy to Madge
Titheradge.

BROTHERS IN MISFORTUNE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The stranger peered into the pound, two
ancient prads were there.
What would they bring? he asked. I
thought a quid might buy the pair.
Or quite conceivably a crown, or possibly a
bob.
He gave a comprehending wink and capped it
with a sob.
“The motor’s run them off the road,” I said,
“and queered their pitch,
And some of them are jugged for board and
more are in the ditch.
They lag superfluous on the stage.” He
shook his hoary locks:
“And who can feel for them like I, wlio’m
in the self-same box?
“They used to earn their hay and corn, those
staunch and patient Dobs,
Before the whirring buzz-cars came to grab
their daily jobs.
We’re victims each of circumstance that
neither could foresee,
And .what the motor’s done for them the
movies have for me.
NOW WHAT COULD HE MEAN BY THAT?
“I suppose if I’d got any brains I’d have a boy with a car.”
“Oh, I dunno. Fellows with cars don’t w ant brains. It’s looks they’re after.”
“True, here and there remain a few that
haven’t come a thud,
The mummers in the foremost rank, the
steeds of speed and blood.
But there are mighty few of them and oh!
how many of us
Whose lurk was anywhere between the
saddle and the ’bus.
“With traction in the horseless car and
drama in the can,
No place is left for them or me,” declared
that actor man.
The deep dejection in his face reminded me
of Lear;
I took him to the nearest pub and shouted
him a beer.
And now whene’er I read of nags up Bourke
or Mudgee way
Sold ’neath the hammer for a zack or pos-
sibly a tray,
I think about the other hacks whom cinemas
condemn,
To uselessness and wonder what’s become—
or will —of them.
N.s.w.
MIDFORD.
Poverty
Point
“Hamfat”: Australia is to see Harrison
Owen’s play “The Happy Husband” earlier
than was anticipated; it is to go on during
the Boucicault season. Thus far there is
no indication as to when the plays of another
Australian, Harry Tighe, will be produced
this side of the world. His “Old Mrs. Wiley”
has been shown to critical applause at the
London Q. Tighe’s first London success,
“Open Spaces,” is being produced in Sweden,
Norway, Denmark and Germany.
“Caesar's Ghost”: Australian theatregoers
connect Somerset • Maugham mainly with
plays like “East of Suez.” “Caroline” gives
him anew introduction. Trained as a phar-
macist, Maughaqi started playwriting when
he was in the late twenties. His first pro-
duction, “Schiffbrucliig,” was produced in
Berlin, in German, in 1901. It was not
until three years later that “A Man of
Honor” was produced in London, and not
until 1907 that “Lady Frederick” —which
ran for 422 performances at the Court
Theatre—made a name for him. In 1908 four
Maugham plays were produced at different
theatres in London at the same time.
“Brian Born”: Vie. Hibernians have been
fulminating against an American film, “The
Callaghans and the Murphys.” Dr. Maloney
complained to the Federal Reps, about it.
The thing is a comic tale of the kind made
familiar by 0. Henry and a dozen other
writers on New York tenement life, and
attracted no hostile attention in Sydney,
but the little doctor and a hundred others
regard it as “an insult to the race.” Years
ago in Queensland a showman roused fury
by exhibiting two chimpanzees under the
names of Casey and Dooley. His explana-
tion that the West African name for the
chimp, is “Kasi” only goaded the objectors
to fresh frenzy, from which the showman
escaped by advertising that he had renamed
the pair “The Two Macs.” The local Cale-
donians didn’t object.
“A.G.M.”: One London manager has sur-
rendered to the cry for cheaper seats. When
J. Bannister Howard reopened the Princess
Theatre with “Compromising Daphne” he
cut prices thus: Stalls, 7s. 6d. and 55.; dress-
circle, 6s. 6d. and 45.; pit, 2s. 6d.; gallery,
Is. And no ninepenny programmes either.
“Compromising Daphne” is the work of A. V.
Peachey, who wrote “Tons of Money.” It
has drawn well in the provinces.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : George Sorley has done
so well with his tent theatre that he feels
lie is due to have a look at the world. He
is off to Europe, and his company will dis-
band for a time, but its members are to go
on “half-salary” till he returns. Occasion-
ally, in the old days, a manager who liked to
be regarded as a philanthropist would put
his company on half-salary if a gap occurred
between two shows. But an act like Sorley’s
would have made old-time mummers drop
dead.
“Jerry J.”: George Carney is another
reminder of the changing fashions of the
music-hall. Originally he was one of the
many cross-talk teams who figured on Eng-
lish bills. He broke loose from Armstrong,
his partner, and offered his talent in the
singular. Armstrong has passed from vaude-
ville programmes. Carney prospered. Dur-
ing the war he was doing the small halls
around Salisbury Plain in a revue titled
“Bubble and Squeak.”
“Craiser”: If a well-known Vic. family
can put an eleven into the field, the Vanbrugh-
Boucicaults could write, act and produce a
play without going outside the home circle.
Dion Boucicault we all know, and his sister
Nina was a favorite with Australiau
theatregoers of the end of the last century.
Site was Kitty Verdun in the first showing
of “Charley’s Aunt.” Another sister, Eva,
married John Clayton Calthrop and gave to
the footlight world actor Donald and drama-
tist Dion Calthrop. Boucicault’s wife, Irene,
has Angela and Violet Vanbrugh for sisters,
playwriting brother Kenneth Barnes, and
daughter Prudence, -who is in the present
combination.
“M.A.”: Margot Lester has been engaged
to play lead in a Broadway production of
Lord Dunsany’s “If”—a feather in the cap
of the little Australian girl. Gladys Cooper
played the part in London. Margot refused
an offer from Winthrop Ames to play in
Galsworthy’s “Escape” in order to have her
name in electric lights on Broadway.
“The Old Adam”: Edgar Wallace, who
writes a play every other month and a
couple of novels during their rehearsal, fills
in the time with sporting chatter (tips
included) and dramatic criticism for the
newspapers. In his critical capacity he
gushed over “The Seventh Heaven,” which
has just reached London, though Sydney
saw it a couple of years ago. Wallace
referred to it in the Morning Post as “Ihe
theatrical event of the year” ; “a play which
will be running in the summer of 1928.”
One is tempted to ask why the thing received
such lukewarm support in this part of the
world. Was it the fault of the acting, the
critics or the public? Or is the author of
“The Ringer” indulging in a little legpulling?
“C. 8.”: Joseph Ilislop is another Scots-
man who has found Australia a grand country.
He is to sing the tenor role at the Mel-
bourne Philharmonic Society’s perennial
Christmas warbling of “The Messiah,” and
he will stay on for the Firm’s opera season.
Twelve months will probably not see the
end of his melodious sojourn—always an-
nounced in the advts., of course, as fleeting.
“Hamfat”: Frank Curzon, the English
theatrical manager, left £181,583. His father
had oil interests, and some of Frank’s money
came from sources other than the box-office.
Curzon has left Jose Collins a life annuity
in the sum of £20,000, which he evidently
reckoned would give the lady a crust.
“S. J.M.”: After viewing an “Australian”
film I’ve concluded that someone is deliber-
ately or otherwise white-anting the business.
In this picture (“The Pioneers”) the hero
is an avowed cattle-duffer shown prac-
tising his profession. The father and
the uncle of the heroine —her ma isn't)
mentioned —are both lags who spend their
declining years in gaol. The heroine, run-
ning true to breed, murders her husband in
a pub on their wedding night, and escapes
to assist her hero in further—presumably
nefarious —enterprises. Comedy effects are
provided by the efforts of the cattle-duffers
to remain in the company of their respective
steeds while the latter are in motion. In
American fiction this kind of thing simply
isn’t done. For instance, the lady-love
of the convict hero in Sabatini’s “Caro-
linean” leaves him, badly wounded, to the
mercies of wild beasts and wilder Indians,
rather than drop a blot on the fair page of
American history.
“M.G.S.”: Somerset Maugham’s hard,
bright, matter-of-fact play, “£he Letter,”
will be Boucicault’s next offering in Mel-
bourne. “The Letter” concerns a planter’s
wife in Malaya who kills her lover. Her
defence is that she was defending her honor,
and at the trial she is triumphantly ac-
quitted. It turns out, however, that she
had written a letter to the man which dis-
closes that her motive was jealousy of his
native mistress. Her lawyer buys the
evidence and suppresses it. The plot is
founded on an actual happening in Malaya,
and it was bitterly resented when it first
appeared in the shape of a short story. In
the absence of hotels, the literary traveller
in those parts has to accept private hospi-
tality. His hosts expand over their whisky-
sodas, little thinking that their confidences
are merely so much copy to their listener.
When the juicy yarn about the doings on the
estate next door comes back in print, there
is the deuce to pay.
“Bulldog Drummond”: American pro-
ducers are at the moment bitten with a
craze for turning straight shows into musi-
comedy. Recent outrages are “The Squaw
Man.” “The Three Musketeers” and “Ari-
zona,” which opened at Atlantic City under
the alias of “Bonita.” “Trilby” has been
jazzed, with Svengali in a comedy part.
Thank the Lord we have a navy, or even
“The Face at the Window” wouldn’t be safe.

Prices at some points slightly higher.
In appearance and value, as well
as performance, Hudson is the most
talked of car of the year. Everyone
is saying there is “nothing like it
in the world.’*
The Super-Six has the smoothness
of an electric motor. Four years’
development led to full release of
its capacity in power, stamina and
safety. It led to a new chassis cap-
able of safely using the wide range
and long life of the motor. New
driving delights resulted. From
the effortless smoothness with
which the Super-Six whisks you
into motion, to the carefree way in
which you may make any trip
from a journey down-town to a
run across the continent, there
remains throughout the zest of
driving that is possible only to its
elastic and smooth flow of power.
Your Hudson Super-Six never
extends itself. It always has
reserve power for the approaching
hill or for greater speed. And its
four-wheel brakes with the flexi-
bility of the motor permit a flash-
ing nimbleness you will like.
The development of Hudson led
also to the creation of the Essex
Super - Six, a counterpart in
general appearance, smoothness,
comfort, quality, easy riding and
safety. Both are engineered to
low operation and maintenance
cost. The bodies are of such
variety and beauty as will satisfy
all demands for luxury and exclu-
siveness as well as comfort and
price advantage*.

[For The Bulletin.]
FOR long days has he ridden,
Scarce living and not dead;
Up towards his damp den hidden
Near the dim watershed.
O’er sodden slip and boulder
The dreary way ascends,
And at his horse’s shoulder
The dead man’s wraith attends.
Weary is he of riding
And fain is he for sleep,
For even in his hiding
A live watch he must keep.
On the forbidding ranges
Are snarling fangs of snow,
Not light nor shadow changes
The barren lands below.
Grey sky and waters lying
Along a lonesome shore.
And one etched thing high-dying—
A hawk, and nothing more.
Even as young lions follow
The home-pad from the kill,
He heads for the far hollow
In the cupped hand of the hill.
He fords the sullen river
That dows all silently.
And feels the rushes shiver
About each lawless knee.
He smells the mouldy bracken
And toadstools in the dew,
And, when the blown airs slacken,
The salt rime stealing through.
Above, he sees in Heaven
The moon’s cold vacant glance,
The merry sisters seven
Met in their starry dance;
Yet feels the sky a stranger
And knows the earth a spy,
And lurking life a danger
Wherever he may dy.
For troopers scan the weather—
And how far smokes uprise!—
And watch the fur and feather
With crafty narrowed eyes.
They watch like snakes that clinging
To the bare bole are hid;
They watch as quick for stinging
As adder ever did.
And now the vines would bind him
And loop about his threat;
And now he hears behind him
An owl’s accusing note.
“Outlawed! Outlawed and branded!”
Seems burnt upon his brain;
Outlawed, and too redhanded,
He goes like every Cain.
But he is home, and blindly,
The sleep he needs must win;
So speaks the dead man kindly
To share his bed within.
And nothing shall betide him
But Sleep, to have his fill —
With the dead man beside him
In the cupped hand of the hill.
MAORILAND. DARIUS.
White Wine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AND while you T re over there, you
might”
“That’s just what I’ve been think-
ing, Grace —combine business with pleasure,
eh?” Absently tinkling his wineglass with
his thick, short fingers, Arthur Bryant looked
up at his wife. “I would very much like to
have a look at the old place. Of course, I’ve
only the faintest recollections —I was only
about six years old when we came over from
Lynunda. Funny that, in all these years,
I’ve never once been back again!”
“In a way, Arthur, I wish I were going
with you. It wouldn’t mean the same to
me, but I should have liked just a glimpse
at your old home. Well, dear, here’s success
to your trip!”
Above the tablecloth their wineglasses
clinked; in the light from the shaded electric
globe sparkling ruby met pale gold—but only
the woman seemed alive to the contrast.
“You and your Barsac!” she laughed, a
trifle nervously. “You know, Arthur, I
never could understand your preference for
Avhite wine. Perhaps it is foolish of me; but,
to my mind, there’s something unsatisfying
about white wine. Wine, of course, it is, but
it hasn’t the color of wine—just look at the
richness, the fulness of this port of mine!”
Bryant regarded his wife curiously, search-
ingly. “That’s a strange fad of yours, Grace
—for it’s not the first time you’ve made the
same observation,” he replied. Brusquely,
in the manner of one scorning a challenge,
he drew his glass to his lips.
Quick to notice the change in his de-
meanor, Mrs. Bryant hastily sought to
appease her husband. “Well,” she said, “you
may not find anything you like so well as
your Barsac, dear, but there’s plenty of white
wine in the district you’re going to, isn’t
there?”
“Rather!” he exclaimed. “I can remember
as a kid walking among the vines, helping
myself to the grapes. There were a lot of
German people in the district then—l won-
der if it’s that way now? Well, one more
glass, and then I’ll have to get busy.”
A manufacturing chemist, Arthur Bryant
had enjoyed considerably more than average
success: and now the opportunity had
i occurred of further extending his activities,
through the establishment of a branch factory
in another State. With the details of this
matter, seated alone in his study, presently
he was occupying himself.
Before long a photograph in an old-
fashioned frame caught his attention as he
chanced to look up from his writing-desk.
For some moments, his expression gradually
softening, he continued to gaze at the photo
—the figure of a clergyman mounted on a
horse.
“Taken somewhere in Lynunda—the dear
old dad !” he murmured. “And mother must
have been a bit of a pioneer, too ! To think
of it —the two of them within six weeks.
And I was only twenty at the time!” His
voice trailed off in a sigh.
A week later, his business in the city
completed, Bryant found himself in the
afternoon train for Lynunda. His affairs
had proceeded smoothly and he was in high
spirits. His memories of Lynunda were
mostly vague ;' nevertheless, certain impres-
sions stood out strongly still.
The train ambled on. .. . The old stone
rectory—the house in which lie was born. . ..
so many years ago; quite likely it had been
pulled down. Possibly the church, too. Who
was the rector now?.. . . His thoughts
ambled on with the train.
Already they were entering the wine-
growing country. As the train proceeded
along the shallow valley his eyes took in
greedily the details of the sunlit scene. Those
countless orderly rows of vines, how clearly
they set out the contour of the land !
The picking season was in full swing; and
many women were among the workers —see,
they were waving their bonnets in greeting
to the train!
“Hullo —Lynunda at last!” Bryant ex-
claimed, with a thrill in his voice. But, as
he stepped on to the platform he was immedi-
ately conscious of disappointment; in no
respect did the scene before him seem fami-
liar. This straggling row of stores; this
burnt-brick, brightly-tuckpointed, pretentious-
looking hotel —this was not the Lynunda he
had known. Apparently, with the construc-
tion of the railway, a new township had
sprung up. A little bewildered, Bryant
looked about him. Over there, to the right,
lay the real township. And beyond it, peer-
ing above the olives, was the church —it was
the same old church, at any rate.
The Commercial? Yes, it would suit; he
would be staying at the place for only one
night.
At the hotel a further disappointment was
in store. “That’ll be the Reverend Stanford
you mean,’’ said the publican, in answer to
his inquiry. “But you won’t find anyone in
this afternoon ; he and his missus have gone
up to town for the day. Eh? Yes, that’s
it—an old stone house with a broad ver-
andah.”
So the old house was still standing. But
it was annoying to find that the rector was
away; he had planned calling on him
straight away, figuring that, whoever he
was, he would be interested to meet the son
of one of his early predecessors. And no
doubt Bryant’s request to be permitted to
see as much as possible of his old home
-would be sympathetically received.
Not until he had passed through the town-
ship proper did Bryant feel really at peace
with his surroundings. Familiar objects,
links with the past, rose up before him.
Here was the shallow, pebbly creek, with
its footbridge for use in winter-time. The
cemetery now-—with the same low, iron-
spiked gate. It seemed incredible that, how-
ever mad, a bull could have jumped that
gate. It was old Steiner’s bull. One
day the beast had nearly succeeded
in tossing him when picking poppies
in Steiner’s paddock—just in time the old
German’s daughter had dragged him through
the fence. No, he had not forgotten that
bull! Round this bend in the road and he
would see the church and then the rectory—
these cypress-trees were still screening them.
This vineyard, with a dozen pickers stooping
among the vines—no, he couldn’t remember
that one.
At last! The quaint old church, with its
rusty galvanised-iron roof —and now there,
lying back a hundred yards or so from the
road, his old home!
No answer came to his knocking; there
was no one about —not even a maid. Then
something caught his attention—something
which he had not previously noticed. A side
window lay partly open.
Here was a piece of luck! Alone, he
would be free to wander about the house at
his will. After some indecision, Bryant
yielded to the temptation; taking the pre-
caution to call out several times through the
window before he climbed into the room.
Across the passage there was the nursery,
his room! It was being used as a study now,
he saw, opening the door. The unfamiliar
arrangement of the room caused him to draw-
back a step. How foolish of him to expect!
—he gave a low laugh. But here was the
familiar old marble mantelpiece, with its
curiously-patterned, streaky-white lines. The
open fireplace, too —the chimney, down which
he had once believed Father Christmas made
his way. Over there by the window his cot
had been —many a time had he stood up in
it, endeavoring to catch a fly buzzing against
the window-pane.
An unusual softness marked Bryant’s
expression as he gazed about the room. In
some way he felt that he had benefited from
his visit. His past life now flashed up before
him; for the first time he seemed to be view-
ing it in its proper perspective, he told him-
self.
Presently there came over Bryant a feeling
of dissatisfaction —the realisation of an
incompleteness in his life; there came to him
regret that he possessed no child in which
he might interest himself. Grace —he had
been unfair to Grace. Only last year an
opportunity had occurred of making partial
reparation—only it had not struck him that
way then. “Poor Mrs. Dalton died this
afternoon. Young Teddy will be parentless
now,” Grace had said to him one evening on
his return from the factory. “Do you know,
Arthur, I’d like to adopt that little boy—
we’re getting up in years now.” Brusquely,
occupied with his affairs, he had thrust the
suggestion aside. And, on that same even-
ing—he had been particularly struck by her
cryptic manner at the time —Grace had taxed
him on the matter of his preference for white
wine.
What was that! Bryant reeled round as
though struck. Again, definite, insistent,
from somewhere within the house, the cry
of a child —a babv cry! The Stanfords had
a baby, then ! But surely they would not
leave the child alone in the house?
Serving to remind him of the unlawfulness
of his presence, the cries increased. After

“Every Picture

Why Endure That
Aching Back?
.i. - /
£)OES your back ache day after day with a dull,
unceasing throb? Do sharp, rheumatic pains
torture you at every sudden move? Are you so tired
and nervous it seems you can never be well again?
Then look to your kidneys! The kidneys, you
know, are the blood-filters. Once they weaken,
poisons are apt to accumulate that healthy kidneys
would have filtered off. Then comes constant back-
ache, headaches, dizziness and kidney irregularities.
One feels lame, stiff and achy—years older than he is.
Don’t risk neglect! Help the kidneys with a reliable kidney medicine. Use Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, the remedy home folks recommend. Ask your neighbor!
EXPERIENCES OF SYDNEY PEOPLE
Mrs. F. Anderson, 29 Thomas Street, Balmain, Sydney, says: “I suf-
fered with my kidneys for a good while, the result being that I was tortured
with backache, and the pain at times was so acute that I had to lie up. My
ankles and legs swelled somewhat and were sore to the touch, and I always
felt tired and languid, having no energy for anything. About two years ago
I was advised to take a course of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and they
w T ere spoken of so highly that I made up nvy mind to try them. After using
a couple of bottles I felt much better, and as I continued taking the pills the
improvement was maintained, five bottles effecting a perfect cure, and I have
been well ever since.”
Eight years later Mrs. Anderson confirms her previous statement:
Doan s Pills made a perfect cure in my case, for I have had no trouble
with my kidneys since this remedy cured me over 10 years ago.”
Mr. Wl James, Hairdresser, Corso. Manly, Sydney, says: “Though,
thanks to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, I was completely cured some
time ago, I shall never forget the agony I suffered from backache, caused, i
air; sure, by my kidneys being disordered. My back was very weak and
constantly paining, and no position seemed comfortable. When I stooped it
was simply torture trying to stand up straight again. I was always tired,
my rest at night was broken, and I was subject to dizzy turns. On the
advice of a friend I took Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and they restored m e
to perfect health, which I still enjoy.”
Six years later Mr. James says: “I have had no return of my old
complaint since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me. My experience
proves that this remedy is thoroughly reliable, and I recommend it with
every confidence to other sufferers.”

some uncertainty Bryant made off in the
direction of the sound.
A bedroom —for a moment he hesitated.
There, crying still, stretched out on the bed
before him, lay the infant. It was kicking
vigorously; at any moment it appeared likely
to fall from the bed. Concerned as to its
safety, Bryant moved across the carpet and
dumped it on to the middle of the bed. As
he did so a piece of paper attached to the
baby’s jacket fell away. “Please look after
him—bottle-fed,” he read.
“Well, I’m damned!” Bryant exclaimed,
repeating the note. “So this explains the
open window. Some grape-picker’s kid—
anyway, someone aware of the Stanfords’
movements.”
The child’s cries grew less continuous;
presently they ceased. Rather a bonny-look-
ing baby, some months old, Bryant observed.
“Him,” the note had said. What would the
Stanfords do when they discovered the
child?
Suddenly, his surprise at his discovery
now past, those thoughts of his while in the
other room reverting to his mind, Bryant
stiffened in a self-questioning attitude. This
baby here —why, it seemed almost as if... .
Here was this baby, here in the very house
in which he was born —and what, if he did
not intervene, would be the future of this
child? The chances were that nobody in
Lynunda would want it; it would become
a ward of the State. But under his roof,
with Grace's care? The thought persisted.
“Bah! what nonsense ! A grape-picker’s
child!” at last he exclaimed, almost savagely,
but without conviction.
A disturbing thought came to him: what
if the Stanfords failed to return by the
evening train? In that event he would have
to come forward; but how would lie be able
to explain liis knowledge of the existence of
this child? His presence in the house was
unlawful; a considerable amount of explana-
tion would be involved. Still, if necessary,
he would return to the house in the darkness,
remove the baby, and place it somewhere
where it could be readily found. For that
matter, too, lie could take the child away
with him and say that he had found it—he
could select any likely spot.
It was convenient that the Commercial
was right opposite the railway-station; he
wmuld be able to watch out for the train in
comfort, Bryant reflected, making his way
back to the hotel.
“That clergyman over there —Mr. Stan-
ford, isn’t it?” endeavoring to conceal his
eagerness, he asked of the old man beside
him on the hotel balcony several hours later.
“Aye, that’s ’im.... Beg pardon, Mister,”
he added, “I didn’t catch y’r name....
Bryant?—a stranger to these parts, eh?
Well, 72 and not a stump in ’is ’ead, Tim
Andrews likes to see a new face. Bryant—
aye, I knows that name well enough!
You’re takin’ me back 40 year ago—to the
days when we ’ad a Parson Bryant here.”
“Indeed?” Bryant chuckled.
“As kind-’earted a man as ever I see,” his
companion went on. “Dead long ago, I
s’pose—wonder what became of ’is little son?
Let me see—Arthur; aye, that were th’ kid’s
name.”
“‘Arthur,’ you say?” Bryant remarked
encouragingly.
“Aye, that were ’is name. A bright little
boy, as I now call to mind. Some said it
were the Steiner girl’s—Hilda Steiner’s —
properly speakin’, found one mornin’ in the
church porch, an’—— Look out, look out,
mister —you’re spillin’ your wine !”
HORTON BROOKS.
Dad in Trouble.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DAD had had a sore neck for days, and
nothing was going right on the selec-
tion.
“You'll have to let me run a needle into
it and poultice it, Murty. I’m sure it’s
a boil you have,” Mother advised in sym-
pathy.
“It’s all right, woman; “it’s all right,”
Dad grunted. “Go away !”
“If it’s a b-b-boil, D-Dad, a knife is
b-b-best to s-s-stick in it,” Joe suggested with
the air of a surgeon.
“Pshaw! said Dad, and went off holding
his head rigid as a gate-post.
A wall of towering trees stood round the
cultivation paddock where the birds made
their nests in the boughs and the cows
camped with their calves. Dad wandered
amongst those trees, and sat with his back
to the butt of one. Presently the voice of
Joe rang out: —
“Dad! You’re w-w-wanted. Mr. M-M-
Maloney w-wants to s-see y’, M-Mother told
me to tell y’.”
“What do he want?” Dad grumbled.
“He's w-waitin’ for y’, D-Dad; and he's
got P-P-Patsy with him.”
Inside, Mother was entertaining Maloney
and his son Patsy with information about
the weather, Dad’s sore neck and the amount
of milk the cows were giving. Patsy was
going to town, and his parent had brought
him along to say good-bye to Dal and Mother
and all of us.
“Phwhat ails you, man?” Maloney asked
as Dad mooched in with a frown on his face.
“You’ve got a bend in you like a camel.”
Joe sniggered, but was promptly silenced
by Mother.
“Nothin’ much, Maloney, nothin’ much—
a bit of a stiff neck, that’s all,” Dad
answered, making light of it.
“We’ve not come to stay at all,” Maloney
went on; “I brought Patsy over to see yiz
all afore he goes off.”
Dad turned bodily to Patsy and eyed him
sternly. “Well, I hope y’ gets on well,”
he said, and shook hands with him.
Maloney was sure Patsy would. “An’ look
after that neck of yours, Rudd,” he advised,
“for y’ don’t look yourself holdin’ your
head down like a bullock under a yoke that’s
too heavy for him.”
“It’s all right, Maloney, it’s all right,”
Dad assured him. “I’m goin’ to get some
o’ them to cut the hair off directly with the
scissors, and then Mother'll poultice it for
me.”
“That’s what it wants,” Maloney agreed—
“the hair is shelterin’ ut; an’ you're as
shaggy on the neck as a lion.”
Then Mother wished Patsy good luck, and
made him promise to come and see us the
first time he came home on holiday, and
away they went.
* * * *
When they had gone Dad, as though mak-
ing up for lost time, moaned and grunted
more than ever.
“Kuk-kuk-come on, Dad, into th’ barn,”
Joe, snipping the air with the scissors,
advised, “an’ I’ll kuk-kuk-cut th’ hair off
your neck for y’.”
“Get a comb, then,” Dad grunted. But
instead of going into the barn he sat on a
box outside, in the chimney corner, and bared
his head and neck.
So astonished was Joe at Dad’s docility
that he stood gaping.
“Ain’t y’ goin’ to cut it?” the other
rumbled down his chest.
“Y-y-yairs,” Joe stuttered, striking a
barber’s attitude. “But will I kuk-kuk-cut
tli’ hair on yer head f-f-fust?”
“Cut round th’ edges.”
Joe commenced, and when Dad felt the
touch of the comb he flinched. Joe raked at
the long hair.
“Dammit,” Dad objected, “don’t touch me
neck with the teeth of it.”
“I w-w-won’t hurt y’, Dad!” Joe assured
his father sympathetically. “D-don't be
fr-fr-frightent.”
Mother came out and stood, a concerned
spectator. She didn’t favor Joe as a hair-
dresser.
“Do you think he can do it for you,
father?” she asked softly.
“He’s doin’ it, ain’t he?”
Mother smiled, and went inside again ; and
Sarah came out, stepping lightly, her face
aglow with curiosity. She watched Joe for
a few seconds, then turned and skipped back
to laugh with Mother.
Joe changed the comb for the scissors.
Dave, smiling in thought over an invita-
tion he had received to a dance in Anderson’s
barn, came round the corner.
“Gripes!” he said, stopping short and
gaping open-mouthed. “Are y’ lettin’ him
cut yer hair?”
“Don’t it look like it?” Dad rumbled.
“D’ y’ all want to cut it?”
“Gripes!” Dave repeated, walking round
the barber’s chair, and picking up some of
Dad’s shorn locks. “He’s tommyhawkin’ it!
.Here, let me at it.”
Just then Joe fumbled the scissors on
Dad’s neck. Dad gave a shudder, but didn’t
dare lift his head. “Dammit, don’t poke at
it!” he yelled.
“It’s him!” Joe answered.
“Go away an’ let him alone!” Dad
growled.
Dave leered silently at Joe. Joe snipped
the scissors at Dave, and grinned.
“Cripes, lie’s hackin’ it off, anyhow!” Dave
threw in a final comment as he moved away.
“S-s-s'l Careful!” Dad flinched. “Take
it off where the boil is. Careful!”
“It's all r-r-riglit, Dad; I’m n-n-not
‘urtin’.” And Joe changed his position.
When he had clipped a patch from the
neck, he paused to blow the loose hairs away,
and to take observations.
“That ain't a b-b -boil, Dad,” he said.
“What is it, then? What do it look like?"
“It's all r-r-red, an’ s-sore lookin’. But it
ain’t a b-b-boil. It’s a h-h -hole. An’ there's
a splinter or s-s-something in it.”
“There was no splinter run in me there!”
Dad said. “Take th’ hair off it, but don't
poke it, boy! Don't poke it.”
“I ain’t pup-pup-pofcm’ it, Dad. I can
see s-s-something in it, though. An’ it
moves when y’ draw your breath.”
Dave returned, and gazed quizzically over
Joe’s shoulder. “Gripes!” lie burst out,
“You got a bloomin’ tick!”
“Wh-aht!” And Dad gave a jump that
hurt his neck, and made him swear.
“A scrub tick!” Dave echoed. It’s goin’
borin’ right into your head, an’ it’s alive!
Y’ can see it wrigglin’ the same as the one
that killed Rooney’s dawg! Holy!”
“Can’t y’ get.hold of it, an' pull it back?”
Dad questioned.
“It’s right in. an’ y’ can only see its hind
legs kickin’. But keep steady. Dad. I’ll
do the same as they did to th' one in the
dawg.”
“But didn’t th’ dawg die?” and Dad began
to perspire.
“Yes. But—hold on— crikey!” Dave
rushed off to the barn.
Mother and Sarah, in answer to Joe,
rushed out and gathered round Dad like
hospital nurses.
“We must put something on to kill it, or
it’ll get into your brain, father!”—-from
Mother.
“Dam’ it!” and Dad trembled.
“Boilin’ vf-vr-water would bring it out,”
Joe suggested.
Dad loudly abused him, and mother, call-
ing him a silly fellow, pushed him away, ami
took the scissors. Sarah fought hard to keep
from laughing.
“Don’t poke it, woman!” Dad yelled.
“Don’t poke it.”
Mother said she was only clipping a little
more of the hair away.
Dave rushed back from the barn.
“Here, look out,” he cried, “till I drop
some o’ this on it.”
“What th’ hell has he got?” Dad
demanded, covering his neck with both hands.
“What is it?”
“Turpentine!” Dave said. “A couple o’
drops’ll bring the tick out.”
Mother and Sarah reckoned it would, too.
“It won’t hurt,” Dave said.
Dad took away his hands, slowly. Dave
tilted the bottle. The others, their heads
together, closely watched results. Dad
shivered in anticipation. Then: Drop!...,
drop !.... drop! fell the turps. And drop /...
drop!... .drop! again. A glad chorus of
“It’s coming! It's out!”
“Is that it?” Dad grunted when Dave
shoved the expiring insect under his nose.
“Well, put it into th’ fire now afore it gets
into someone else.”

is an enthusiastic statement made by Mr. P. W. Armstrong
of Perth, a well-known and respected pioneer of the Motor
Business in Australia, who recently toured across Australia
in an Erskine Six Roadster.
“This is my eighth journey by road across Australia and it has been the
most satisfactory and trouble-free of any of them. Not once on the long
journey did we open the tool-box nor did we suffer a single puncture.
The Erskine’s engine was running with perfect sweetness on arrival at Sydney,
and certainly much better than when we left Perth.
“The 3096 miles were covered at an average speed of 21 m.p.h. which is the
best touring record established between Perth and other State Capitals.
It is a grand little car and I am pleased to take this opportunity of expressing
my high opinion of it.” p. W . ARMSTRONG
Likewise in every corner of the world
this dauntless performer is showing its
thoroughbred spirit—proving that quality
has been painstakingly built into every
detail of its design —demonstrating that
it has inherited the dependability of its
Studebaker ancestors plus economy
and performance all its own*
