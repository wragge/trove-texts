Of a New Magazine.
About five or six years ago an artist
named Will H. Bradley drew sketches for Mel-
bourne Punch. His work was generally clever
and piquant, and there were some artistic
regrets when by-and-by he drifted away into
oblivion. The other day he swam into Aus-
tralian ken again with a new magazinecalled Brad-
ley, His Book, published at Springfield, TJ. S.A.
Bradley’s book is novel and attractive. The
literary contents have little value ; but the illus-
trations, line-work in the mode of Beardsley, or
massed liglit-and-shadow blocks of the new poster
type, or such as Sou ter gives The Bulletin, are
nearly always clever and charming. And Brad-
ley’s art-training enables him to get beautiful
effects from color-printing done in the oapable
American way.
Further, Bradley’s book isn’t stereotyped.
His cover varies with every number, his pictures
are here, there, and everywhere on the page, and
in the margin as well, and he occasionally prints
some of his matter twice over, and plays similar
pranks which so far have not become objection-
able. This quatrain is so honored with a rentree—
The soul of wit they have not sensed
Who do not early learn
The more the sunbeam is condensed
The deeper does it burn.
Which is good enough as a motto for Bulletin
contributors.
And surely this nigger song, by Nixon
Waterman, is one of the prettiest written—
MELON SO:.G.
Oh, I told mah Honey, and she told me—
I leaned right close to her ear
An’ she hung her head, but what we said,
I ain’t a-gwi:ie ter tell right here.
Steal along, steal along ; everybody feel along,
Melons jes’ a-orackin’ at de core ;
Lif’ yer foot ez light ez de fox in de night
An’ dey won’t bea-crackin’ any more.
Chorus :
Hush, hush ! de ’possum’s in de ’simmon tree :
Hush, hush! de coon is in de corn:
De rabbit ain’t a-peepin’ an’ de mockin’bird’s a-sleepin’,
An’ we ain’t a-gwine home till de morn.
Oh, I love mah Honey, an’ she loves me ;
She’s got a pizen tickle in her eye.
She’s fair an’ sweet from head to feet,
An’ we’re gwine ter build a home bine-by.
Slip along, slip along ; everybody trip along,
Melons am a-lookin’ mighty fine ;
We’re gwine fer to feast till it’s light in de east,
An’ we won’t leave a melon on de vine.
Oh I kissed mah Honey an’ she kissed me—
Nobody lookin’ to’ to tell—
One, two, three, four—yes, yes—lots more!
Fo’ we both like the kisses mighty well.
Glide along, glide along ; everybody slide along ;
Bettah keep a-lookin’ fo’ a gun ;
When yo’ hear me w'histle low an’ long, jes’ so— (whistle)
It’s a warnin’ ’at it’s time fo’ to run.
And Another New Magazine.
Two years ago, when The Yellow Book
was young, it was brilliant. The first numbers
had an unrivalled list of contributors—Henry
James, “George Egerton,” Hubert Crackan-
thorpe, Henry Harland, William Watson, Max
Beerbohm, John Davidson, Ella D’Arcy, and half-
a-dozen other of the brightest names in current
English verse and story. And it was understood
that the new magazine was to be audacious and
anti - Phihstinish which it was. “Victoria
Cross, ” who afterwards wrote the inferior ‘ ‘ Woman
Who Didn’t,” gave the fourth volume possibly
the warmest passion-story in English. It was the
maximum-mark of the Yellow Book's wicked-
ness. Apparently Mrs. Grundy protested, and
there was division in the yellow camp. The best
®f the auxiliaries left to found the Savoy ; the
others remained to make The Yellow Book as
dull as themselves.
Arthur Symons edits the Savoy —a clever
yoang man who puts too much woman in his
work to get full credit for it in hypocritical
Britain. He is not very deep, maybe; but in the
dexterous expression of tender sentiment, now
sweet, now poignant, be has no English rival. Ho
writes perfumed prose, too, after the fashion of
Bourget and Loti, and he has intimate bonds
with the French symbolist school of poets, and
carries their inspiration into English. Here is
one of his latest pieces :
THE OLD WOMEN.
They pass upon their old, tremulous feet,
Creeping with little satchels down the street,
And they remember, many years ago,
Passing that way in silks. They wander, slow
And solitary, through the city ways,
And they alone remember those old days
Men have forgotten. In their shaking heads
A dancer of old oarnivals yet treads
The measure of past waltzes, and they see
The candles lit again, the patohouli
Sweeten the air, and the warm cloud of muslr
Enchant the passing of the passionate dusk.
Then you will see a light begin to creep
Under the earthen eyelids, dimmed with sleep,
And a new tremor, happy and uncouth,
Jerking about the corners of the mouth. '
Then the old head drops down again, and shakes,
Muttering.
Sometimes, when the swift gaslight wakes
The dreams and fever of the sleepless town,
A shaking huddled thing in a black gown
Will steal at midnight, carrying with her
Violet little bags of lavender,
Into the tap room full of noisy light ;
Or, at the crowded earlier hour of night,
Sidle, with matches, up to some who stand
About a stage-door, and, with furtive hand,
Appealing: “I, too, was a dancer, when
Your fathers would have been young gentlemen I ”
And sometimes, out of some lean ancient throat,
A broken voioe, with here and there a note
Of unspoilt crystal, suddenly will arise
Into the night, while a cracked fiddle cries
Pantingly after ; and you know she sings
The passing of light, famous, passing things.
And sometimes, in the hours past midnight, reels
Out of an alley upon staggering heels,
Or into the dark keeping of the stones
About a doorway, a vague thing of bones
And draggled hair.
And all these have been loved,
And not one ruinous body has not moved
The heart of man’s desire, nor has not seemed
Immortal in the eyes of one who dreamed
The dream that men call love. This is the end
Of much fair flesh ; it is for this you tend
Your delicate bodies many careful years,
To be this thing of laughter and of tears,
To be this living judgment of the dead,
An old grey woman with a shaking head.
ARTHUR SYMCNS.
With the dissident-decadents came clever
Aubrey Beardsley (who was lying very ill when
last mail left), and the Savoy has all the benefit
of his eccentric art. Havelock Ellis, too, is an
adherent, and contributes strong articles on
Nietzche and Hardy, which are not so heavy as
much of his critical work in literature. And he
has some fresh thoughts which, though you may
cavil at them, present that most desirable thing in
literature —a new point of view. E.g. —
It is a curious illustration of our attitude towards
literature that Scott’s method of paying off his debts by
feverish literary production seems only to arouse our un-
qualified admiration. The commercial instinct in onr
British breasts is so highly developed that we glory in
the sight of a great man prostituting his fame to make
money, especially in a good cause. If he had paid off his
debts at the gaming table, or even at the Stock Exchange,
perhaps we should have been shocked. As he only flung
his own genius and art on to the table to play against a
credulous public his virtue remains immaculate.
And again—
There never was a novelist so superhumanly and
obstreporously clever as Mr. Meredith. One suspects
that much of the admiration expended on Meredith, as
on Browning, is really the reader’s admiration of his own
cleverness in being able to toddle along at the coat-tails
of such a giant, [Will the Austral Salon debate this
thesis?] Crude intellect is as much outside art as crude
emotion or crude morals. One admires the splendid pro-
fusion of power, but the perfected achievement which
alone holds our attention permanently is not to be found
among these exuberantly brilliant marionettes. It is all
very splendid, but I find no good reason for reading it,
since already it scarcely belongs to our time, since it never
possessed the virtues which are independent of time.
Like Balzac, George Meredith has built to his own
memory a great cairn in literature. No doubt it will be
an inspiring spectacle for our race to gaze back at.
A short story, “The Idiots,” by Joseph
Donrad, is by far the best in recent literature.

The English Xmas Numbers, as usual, are
mostly inanities, colored babies, and bad stories
by men with good names. The only yarn a con
scientious scribe can commend so far is Kipling’s
“Bread Upon the Waters,” in the Graphic
which is calculated to bring more joy to a Scotcl
ship’s-engineer—there was an Irish ship’s-engineer
once, but he died—than anything else until he
gets to Gehenna and hears themuekle black jQe’i
say, “Weel, mon, hoo’s a’ wi’ ye? Come awa
ben.” Kipling takes as much trouble with his
work now as when he was just beginning, anc
puts to shame the lazy lot of traders on the
notoriety of one decent book. And his Scotch
“ ghost ” is a very fine fellow.
The new Society for Being Rather Tired of
Shakespeare, which was founded the other day
in the interior of The Bulletin— with an annua
subscription of 2s. 6d.—does not seem sufficient to
fill the very large gap in the hedge of pessimism.
The exterior of The Bulletin has therefore
founded a newer Society for Being Rather Tired
of Everything, in which there will be no charge
for membership, since there is hardly anything
which it is better to be Rather Tired of than an
annual subscription of 2s. 6d. It seems a pity to
extinguish so abruptly the Society for Being
Rather Tired of Shakespeare, which had perhaps
weeks of active weariness before it, but the mem-
bers of the newer Society for Being Rather Tired
of Everything will necessarily be Rather Tired of
the new Society for Being Rather Tired of Shakes-
peare. In a little while it is proposed to found a
newest Society for Being Rather Tired of the
Society for Being Rather Tired of Everything,
and so on, in a natural progression, until the
should-be-next Society is too Rather Tired to say
the tremendous title which is waiting for it, and
dies from sheer fatigue some time before it is born.
R.S. : “ Fitzgerald’s Alpine book abounds
in fiction so startling that snow-clad Aorangi
turns away in cold disdain, as is shown in the
photo., where the eastern slopes are made to look
in the opposite direction.”
Some of the magazines nowadays have
tired of the eternal Meissenbach, and announce
“ no photographs ” ; and the prospectus of Dent’s
forthcoming “Temple Classics” says that “a
special and distinctive feature of the series will be
the absence of introductions, prefaces, and appre-
ciations.” The writer has long held the preface
system intolerable. When you read, you want to
read the author and form your own estimate of
him ; you don’t want to be bothered in advance
by somebody else’s opinion. More, that opinion is
bound to be confusing, since, to properly value it,
you must be in the position of the preface-writer,
you must have read and considered the work—
and you haven’t. Therefore, the preface, if there
be any, should always come last, and be called a
postface, an afterword, or an appendix. In some
current publications the preliminary gloss is to
text as Ealstaff’s sack to Ealstaff’s bread, with
none of Falstaff’s reason.
“ Sir George Tressady,” Mrs. Humphry
Ward’s new sermon, must be laid by for a wet
Sunday: it looks altogether too dull to waste
good sunshine tyi. Probably it is dull—the only
publication noticed praising it up to present is the
Literary World, which calls it ** a great work.”
This is ominous, since the Litebary World is
little more, than a publishers’ circular, and seems
to proportion its praise to the size of the relevant
advt. When the Literary World is in superla-
tives, it is because the publisher fears a slump.
Homely Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
POLLY AND DAD AND THE SPRING-
CART.
The old Man’s putting Polly into the old spring-
cart
He bought when he was married—and didn’t he
reckon it smart;!
He always counts old Polly a first-rate trotting
mare :
In fact, he thinks the whole turn-out is quite a
stylish affair.
The wheels are dished, and the poor old cart has
been knocked about a lot,
And Polly is old and lazy and lame, and doesn’t
like to trot.
We often say to the old Man they’re all on the
track down-hill,
But his eyes flash upas he answers back, “There’s
plenty of go in us still.”
When the old Man goes to the township he’s sure
to get into a row ;
And, poor old chap, it-wouldn’t take much to
finish him right off now ;
So whenever he yokes up Polly and toddles into
the town,
One of us goes to fetch him out before the sun is
down.
His usual place is Riley’s, so we always try there
first,
And when he’s just a little bit “on,” it’s then we
find him worst;
We’d rather see him thoroughly drunk—for then
he can’t show fight,
And we bundle him into the old spring-cart anc
see that the tailboard’s right.
Poor old Man ! and poor old mare ! and poor old
spring-cart, too !
Many a hundred miles they’ve gone, when they
all were young and new ;
Many a mile they’ve gone in dust, and many a
mile in rain—
One of them, some of these days, will go, and the
others won’t run again.
The old Man often grumbles that his children al]
are gone;
And most of tfiem never seem to care how their
poor dad’s getting on ;
And perhaps old Polly’s motherly thoughts may
run in a similar way,
For all her family’s scattered, too, except a black
and a bay.
The first she had was a fine roan colt, but he got
killed in a whim :
Loony Sam was driving the thing, and you couldn’t
depend On him;
And the pretty young chestnut filly, that never
had any brand,
Was sold out o’ pound on the Sydney side; and
another died with the sand.
One we sold to a parson, and the parson drives
him hard;
And another we swapped for a watch and chain
to a chap at the old stockyard ;
And one I saw in a butcher’s-cart out Goulburn
Valley Way ;
And another belongs to a German cove, down
about Rivoli Bay.
The old Man’s family’s just the same—scattered
here and there;
And dead is the mother that loved them and
thought them all so fair :
She was proud of her girls—l know it!—and
proud of her big boys, too;
And she worked and did for the lot of us—all
that a mother can do.
Watty was killed in a hurdle-race; the horse he
was riding fell;
Harry has gone to the West, and I think he is
doing pretty well;
Nell is down in a shop in town—Dad and she had
a row;
And Lily married a real nice chap—she’s living in
Adelaide now.
Fred is up in Queensland, and he hasn’t written
for years,
But we hear about him now and again from a
station where he shears;
Annie is at Port Fairy, and the last we heard of
Bill
He was somewhere over in New South Wales
working there at a mill.
So the only ones that are left at home are Jimmie
and I and Bell,
And I always think it’s our duty to look after the
old Man well;
And to keep an eye on the poor old mare and the
poor old spring-cart, too :
For Polly is twenty, and the cart—well, it isn’t
exactly new !

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. 6. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven yea:3, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first, dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney."
" My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the hack and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
Undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

69 other leading residents.

whose New and Scientific Treatment, by purifying and
enriching the blood, gives new life and tone to the
whole nervous and muscular systems, and builds up a
new constitution in the most enfeebled. The first week of
treatment brings glad relief, and PERSEVERANCE
ensures a thorough and LASTING CURE.
MEN
Suffering from NERVOUSNESS and DEBILITY and
EXHAUSTION should try Dr. SPEER’S celebrated
Remedies, which strike at the root of the disease. The
symptoms gradually disappear, nervousness and timidity
vanish, vigor and lost health return, sunken eyes retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded , the weak and debilitated consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.
AliTi CONSXJI/TATIONS FREE.
Persons residing at a distance can, by describing their
troubles in detail, be treated at home. The course of

possibility of a cure. If the patient is curable, he will tell
him so ; if not, he will also tell him. He undertakes no

Dr- GrIBBONTS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
Profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely:—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, Ac.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt oe 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
debility,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the. Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.

Various Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
President Kruger was lately asked to open
a Jewish school in connection with Johannesburg
synagogue, which the old humorist did by saying :
“ In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I declare
this school opened.” And as soon as he heard
that the Water co., during the water-famine, had
been exploding dynamite in the hope of breaking
the passing clouds, he wired from Pretoria to have
it stopped at once, “ as it was like shooting in the
eye of the Lord.”
WHAT CARE?
"An unsexed creature equipped with votes, bloomers,
and other masculine appurtenances.”—Australasian.
What care, O ye of the trousered clan,
What care if the girl embolden ?
What care if she clutch at the rights of man
And his masculine garment olden ?
For the Fair have alway held a regal sway,
And the sway of the Fair is golden.
What care so the pearls as of yore break through
Her smile in a gleam of splendour ?
What care so we taste of the rose-leaf dew
That lurks in her lips’ surrender ?
What care so the hue of her eyes be blue
Aglow with a lovelight tender ?
What care so her hair be of rippling gold—
The hair that our hopes are tied in ?
What care so her eyes have a deep untold—
A deep for the soul to hide in ;
And her bosom’s fold have a tender hold—
A hold for the heart to bide in ?

NATURE’S WILL.
Let us sit down here, love, on this gentle hill.
Nature softly whispers : “Let me have my will.” ■
Casting off his fleetness spins the setting sun,
And one faint star signals “ Weary day is done.”
Let us sit down here, love, in this shady place :
Thou to watch the sunset, I thy radiant face.
Splashes in the west there—is it not a sign
That the flirting Hebe spills her master’s wine ?
See ! some stars are winking, and from the lagoon
Like a bubble golden swells the ponderous moon.
How the frangipani oppresses all the gloom ;
What a heavy richness hangs o’er every bloom.
Happiness supreme, love, ’tis at least for me :
All this drowsy splendour glows with warmth in
thee;
In thine eyes’ dark azure, with the love-lights
there ;
In the clouded incense of thy heavy hair.
Q.
A. D. BAYLDON.
UNATTAINABLE.
Stainless icicle so cold !
Was there ever heart so bold,
Made a mastery so felt
That your spirit could but melt ?
From Love’s fiery-laden eyes,
Looking on you to surmise
All your magic, you do turn
Like a Vestal to her urn.
In to-morrow there may be
Such a sun to conquer thee,
As shall win the sleeping soul,
Hidden from us at its pole.
He shall gather all the light,
Shielded from all other sight;
Bathe in the mysterious stream,
That to others is a dream !
HUBERT CHURCH.
A PLATONIST.
The scent of summer clover
Is wafted where I lie,
And lingers lightly over
Before it passes by.
It stays awhile its fleetness,
As on the wind it goes,
To fill my soul with sweetness
And charm away my woes.
Among the wattle bushes
That shade the singing creek,
The speckle-breasted thrushes
Are playing hide-and-seek;
And every cadence falling
Upon the summer breeze
Seems like my spirit calling
Some love it never sees.
The perfume and the singing,
The colors all around,
The dainty flowers up-springing
From out the moist, warm ground,
The wonders all upthronging
In beauty everyside,
All fill my soul with longing,
Unknown and mystified.
No heart can cherish dearer
Than mine, such joys as these ;
No eye distinguish clearer
The beauty that it sees.
Yet nature seems suggesting
In every sense-delight,
And makes my soul unresting
To reach the infinite.

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1896.
This Great Rich Country.
A matter in which the Australian believes
with the solid belief that is born of long un-
reasoning habit is the wealth and financial
greatness of his great new land. The cant
phrases of local politics are full of this pro-
found faith. The “ resources of our country,”
the “ undeveloped wealth of this great
country,” the “boundless mineral riches of
this country,” the necessity for “ opening up
the great interior” and “ tapping the unde-
veloped resources of the land ” —these and a
dozen similar expressions are of constant
recurrence in the vocabulary of politics.
The dreary wash of Parliamentary declama-
tion is full of them and things like them,
and the Australian so far trusts in them that
he perpetually regards the state of his
country—except when it is in the wild, mad
drunkenness of the occasional boom—as one
of casual and accidental depression, which
will naturally pass away when the “bound-
less resources ” have time to assert them-
selves. He believes, as a matter of fact,
that because of these alleged unusual re-
sources his country has a natural tendency
to be greater and richer than other countries ;
that it can riot round more recklessly thau
other countries, because the resources will
pull it through ; and that, whereas other
countries need to be raised out of depression
by a dead lift, Australia —by reason, as usual,
of the “ boundless resources ” —will get out
by itself. The visible fact that Australia,
save for its gold-boom, which is now to all
appearance mostly over, is a very ordinary
country with about as much resources as the
average, hasn’t yet fully dawned on the en-
thusiastic native. It will probably do so by-
and-by, but not just yet.
• * • *
The Government Statisticians of Victoria
and New South Wales have a great deal to
do with this gorgeous delusion. Up till
1890, after which the violent decadence set
in, they were accustomed to publish gorgeous
and ever-increasing estimates of the aggregate
private wealth of the seven provinces.
Coghlan’s last report set forth that the
private wealth of New South Wales amounted
to £368 per head ; of Victoria, to £304 per
head ; S.A., to £3lO ; and so on. Hayteu,
in Victoria, estimated the private wealth of
his province, just before the great boom went
wrong, as high as £4OO or more per head.
Both agreed that no other country in the
world—not even France, or Britain, or the
United States—could show anything ap-
proaching these gorgeous totals, and that
Australia was really the wealthiest country
upon earth. It is true that Australia has
little shipping of its own ; its railways are
mortgaged abroad to more than their full
value, and don’t, as a whole, pay interest on
cost, so they can’t be regarded as an asset ;
roads, bridges, docks are mostly in the same
situation ; a vast amount of the land, both
town and country, is owned abroad also ;
likewise a lot of the mining interests, and
much of the loose cash in the banks, and a
vast amount of the mortgages. In fact,
Australia is minus a large proportion of the
assets which make up the wealth of the
United States, Britain, France and Ger-
many ; but, by a gorgeous inflation of pro-
perty values, she was made to look wonder-
fully rich, and was boomed accordingly.
* » * *
Since 1890 no new estimates have been
made, but the old ones are republished with
monotonous regularity. If a new one was
made, however, based on things as they are
now, and, if it was made honestly and ac-
curately, the probable showing would be that
Australia is a comparatively poor country—
poorer, in proportion to population, than the
U.S., Britain, France, Germany, or Belgium
—and that it hasn’t really been anything else
for many years past. The value of property
was kept up almost solely by borrowing.
When two or three million loaned sovereigns
were dumped annually into a community of
one million souls, it made an artificial boom
and sent the nominal value of property up
10 or 12 or 20 millions. The wild abun-
dance of money made it possible for almost
anybody to get “accommodation.” When
100 men bought property in Melbourne with
English money borrowed from the banks it
made an artificial rise in price. Then the
fact that property was obviously going up
made 1000 more buy likewise —with borrowed
money—and that made it go up still more ;
and the further rise made 10,000 men buy,
and so the razzle-dazzle went on. They
bought on paper, and the banks discounted
the paper, and, as long as the rise continued,
the bills were met reasonably well, and while
they were met the lending and the buying
and the rise went on. And, while money
thus went round and round in a circle, it was
quite possible for £2,000,000 of borrowed
cash to make the value of property go up
£20,000,0000r more, and thus add£lB,ooo,ooo
to the aggregate wealth of the community.
Also, by a converse process, when the bor-
rowed money ceased to roll in, it was quite
possible for the non-arrival of two millions
to make the country slump to the extent of
twenty millions, and, when the panic thus
created led to the withdrawal of another two
millions, this, on top of the previous disaster,
was quite equal to making another slump
of forty millions.
* * * *
It is an acknowledged fact that the value
of the land and buildings of Sydney and
Melbourne has declined in six years to the
extent of about one-third, despite the fact
that the municipal valuations of six years
ago were very different from the gorgeous
boom values of banks and land-jobbers. The
selling value of property, so far as can be
gathered, has declined fully one half. The
value of wool has dropped so heavily that
the real worth of pastoral land—which it has
been the custom to assume .at something like
10s. to £1 an acre—if it is calculated on the
actual returns, is probably not over ss. an
acre all round. It can’t, certainly, be written
down to that figure ; if it was it would make
such a ghastly diminution of the alleged
assets of banks and pastoral and mortgage
companies that the result would be a general
confession of insolvency, therefore it has to
be kept up by common agreement at a
fictitious figure, but taking the continent all
over ss. an acre is probably not far astray.
The fact that the Australian banks last year
only earned all round 2 per cent, on the
shareholders' funds suggests a general over-
valuation of their assets. The other fact
that the mineral output is getting steadily
and persistently less in proportion to popu-
lation raises a presumption that another
national resource is fading considerably.
The tremendous shrinkage in the assets of
those institutions which have been compelled
to face their creditors and make a statement
of their real position is a fair evidence of the
general shrinkage of everything. There are
everywhere reasons for the assumption that
this great rich land badly needs to revise
that national balance-sheet which it regards
with such unreasoning pride.
* * * *
In fact it is difficult to find any solid evi-
dence whereon to base the good old belief in
the great wealth and resources of Australia.
The commerce of this country is made to
look especially vast by reckoning internal as
well as external trade in the total ; if the
United States reckoned in the interchange of
one State with another, or Britain included
the local trade of England, Scotland, Ireland,
and Wales with each other, they would arrive
probably at equally gorgeous results. Taking
external trade only in all cases, Australia
comes immensely behind Holland and Bel-
gium, behind Great Britain and Cape Colony,
and very little ahead of Denmark, Uruguay,
Chili, and various other places generally
reckoned of no special account. The shipping
business of Australia, in proportion to popu-
lation, is less than that of Britain, Russia,
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Bel-
gium, Argentina, Canada, or South Africa.
The mineral production is still a gorgeous
item, but it doesn’t nearly keep pace with in-
crease of population ; in fact, it is practically
only half as much per inhabitant as it was 20
years ago. In the matter of agricultural
wealth this country produces not quite half
as much per inhabitant as France, Denmark,
the United States, Spain, or Canada, and
much less than Germany, Austria, Italy,
Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Holland, Bel-
gium, Uruguay, Argentina, and one or two
other countries. As a wine-producing land
it turns out about one-sixth as much as
wretched little Bulgaria, a mere fly-speck on
the map of Europe, and is ahead of hardly
any wine-producing countries in the world
save Mexico and Persia. Even as a wool-
growing country, despite its special advan-
tages through practically unlimited space,
Australia only keeps a very small distance
ahead of Argentina, and is followed up very
closely by Russia and the United States. As
regards the visible supply of money per head
Australia is behind France, and only a frac-
tion ahead of Holland and one or two other
countries. In fact, there are so very few
points in which this country is distinctly
ahead that the boast of its phenomenal
wealth seems to rest on a somewhat shadowy
foundation. The balance of evidence is to
the effect that, its first burst of glory being
over, it is a very respectable, ordinary
region upon the whole, with about the same
advantages and disadvantages as many other
regions when one thing is balanced against
another, and with about the same amount of
glorious future per inhabitant as a dozen
other countries of more or less importance.
* * * *
lf Australia is, as its gorgeous statisticians
allege, the richest land on earth, then it is
a strange anomaly that its whole existence
should be one continuous career of borrowing
from nations proportionately much poorer
than itself, for the purpose of staving off
insolvency. Its inhabitants pay less taxa-
tion apiece than those of Great Britain,
France, Italy, Holland or Argentina,
and are so unwilling to stand any
further burdens that almost every one of
the seven provinces constantly makes its
budget square on paper by charging current
expenses to loan moneys ; by borrowing for
road-making, bridge-building, railway con-
struction, for statues, public buildings, re-
pairs to ditto, dredging, reclamation, mud-
shifting, sand-shovelling, and all manner of
other things. The inference is, either that
the Australian is a poor, wretched, beggared
individual who can’t meet his ordinary ex-
penses as the Briton or the Dutchman does,
and that the resources of this great country
and its vast wealth and its magnifi-
cent future are all mere visionary
drivel ; or else that he is a lazy,
shiftless, unpractical, self-indulgent being
who lacks the courage to face responsibilities
which other nations —nations that he mostly
regards with lofty disdain-—do face and over-
come constantly and with little apparent
effort. Whichever way the matter is looked
at, the Australian comes out rather badly.
If he has all the alleged wealth and resources
that he credits himself with, then he shouldn’t
need to grovel to poorer countries for finan-
cial assistance ; if he hasn’t these extraordi-
nary resources, then the extraordinary bor-
rowing which is based on them means future
disaster. There are several good reasons
why Australia should seriously take stock of
its alleged stupendous w'ealth and of its
alleged great future. If they are there, then
the present Australian is a weak-kneed spend-
thrift ; if they are not, then he is a more or
less bankrupt dreamer living in a fool’s para-
dise, and it should interest him to find out
which of the two he really amounts to.
Mount Rennie.
The surviving Mount Rennie prisoners are
liberated at last. Proud is The Bulletin of
the fact that, when every other Sydney-printed
paper of any circulation connived at the
unspeakable infamies of the “ trial ” which
preceded the massacre of four 18-year-old boys,
this paper steadily denounced the hideous farce
as a savage lynching in the name of civilised
justice. To-day, The Bulletin is more
strongly than ever of the opinion which
it expressed ten years ago. It has been
accused by press and politicians of sympathy
with crime and enmity to law and order,
whereas its impeachment of the methods of the
Mount Rennie trial was founded on its detesta-
tion of the greatest and most dangerous of all
crimes—the denial of justice to the Common
People.
* * * *
The Bulletin held then, as it holds now and
will ever hold, that when moneyless prisoners
defended by Crown-assigned counsel are being
tried for their lives—more, when they are
being capitally tried for an offence which is
capital in no other country —they are entitled
to a trial no less fair and formal than would be
given to a case involving the ownership of a
stack of hay or a five-pound note. The Bul-
letin holds that the strongest and best bul-
wark of society is the people’s confidence in the
passionless administration of justice, and that
the Court and the Executive which drag jus-
tice in the dirt are a more dangerous, be-
cause more insidious, enemy of the nation
than the foulest felon ever placed be-
hind the spikes. It holds that it is
a national calamity when even the blood-
soaked ruffian cast for death is dragged away to
the condemned cell feeling in his heart, no
matter what words may be on his lips, that the
Judge before whom he was ostensibly tried
acted not as a Judge but as a prosecutor —for,
after all, there is a sense of justice, and to that
extent a good public opinion, even among the
blackest criminals in gaol.
The alleged offence for which the four boys
were hanged was cumulative rape, but the
method of their trial constituted a cumulative
criminal assault on the Goddess of Justice by
her own appointed guardians. The jury who
convicted nine prisoners out of eleven (after a
week-long day-and-night trial, ending with a 33-
hour day-and-night sitting with but five hours’
intermission) were so exhausted as to lie “dead to
the world.” Exhausted jurymen slept in the box
at intervals ; for all practical purposes they
might as well have been.insensible from drink
or had half-a-grain of morphia under each
skin. Jurymen slept while barrister O’Mara
was compelled to plead to them for the life of
a man (subsequently hanged and now shown
to be innocent) at the ghastly hours
of from midnight to half-past three in the
morning; jurymen slept while the massive
animal on the bench droned out to them his
10-hour charge, which began only five hours
after the termination of a 19-hour sitting.
The witnesses whose unsifted evidence clinched
the Crown case were two then unknown persons,
one of whom within a month after the trial
uttered a forged cheque on a city publican, and
had his alleged felony compounded out of money
raised by public subscription (under the
auspices of the then Lieut.-Gov.!) as a tribute
to his bravery and virtue—and the other of
whom was within 18 months sent to penal
servitude for arson. The prosecutrix’s story as
to how she came to be at Mount Rennie on the
day bore less than half-truth on the face of it,
and her identifieatory evidence was obviously
impossible in view of the shock and injuries she
was alleged to have sustained and in view of
the many emendations and qualifications she
was permitted to make by a court which, from
beginning to end, showed not one trace of
analytical impartiality.
* * * *
Now comes ex-Premier Dibbs to justify the
decision of the sleep-drunken court and the no
less panic-drunken Executive, which latter
decision, be it said to the intellectual credit of
(among others) two men now in their graves,
was arrived at by a majority of one only !
though one dissentient juryman would have
been sufficient to save the boys’ lives in the
Supreme Court below ! The fact is, that in the
Mount Rennie case, “ the push ” were lynched
by “good society’’and its organs the newspapers
—by the self-righteous Botany Bay canaille who
years before had denied to Butler Cole
Aspinall the honorary membership of Sydney’s
leading club because he, in the exercise of his
profession as a barrister, had taken a brief to
defend O’Farrell the lunatic, of a family of
lunatics, the attempted assassin of the Duke of
Edinburgh.
* * * *
Let us have for all accused citizens, rich and
poor, high and low, a fair, impartial, sober
daylight trial. But if we must have lynch-law,
then let the rope be soaped and the vigilance-
bell rung for those enemies of society who
would dynamite our civilisation by destroying
the confidence of the Common People in the
passionless impartiality of the Supreme Court
of our country.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Something’ Like a Test Question.
Melbourne Champion, in a recent issue,
alleges that a land values tax “ should be, and
could be, made the test question at next Vic.
general election.” It could, certainly. Also,
if it was made the test question it would pro-
bably be received with acclamation and a big
majority be returned in favor of it. Then the
Assembly would pass a law imposing a land
values tax, and the Council would promptly
crumple it into a paper-ball and shoot it out of
the window as per usual. It always does in
such cases. There is no earthly use in worry-
ing much about any question at next Vic.
general election or any other Vic. general
election, except the one question: How to
utterly smash the House of 48 Rich Landlords.
The Victorian, from sheer force of habit, keeps
on troubling about how to get an Assembly
majority in favor of this, that or the other, just
as if it matters a straw what the Assembly
majority is in favor of so long as the Council is
immoveable, and throws out every really pro-
gressive measure with such beautiful regularity.
He apparently hasn’t begun to realise even yet
that while the Council is what it is the best the
Assembly can do is not to do any serious harm ;
to do anything that is notably or actively good
is beyond its power. Even the Liberal press
has seemingly not yet dropped to the situa-
tion, and goes on talking about the advisability
of getting good men into the Lower House,
despite the fact that the House of F. Sargood
nullifies all their best efforts, and the good men
are almost wholly wasted. The more or less
great David Syme himself, whose paper pub-
lishes such beautiful articles about the necessity
for paralysing the House of Ancient Sloth and
Fossildom —though he is about as good a
Liberal as a man of his wealth can afford to be,
and though he has the necessary qualification —
never offers to do the one thing that would be
of any real use in such a case—namely, to oust
Sargood or some other fossil from his seat and
become an M.L.C. himself, and thus carry the
war into the enemy’s camp and set an example
which might induce others to do likewise. In
Victoria every man thinks some one else should
do something to the Council. And mean-
while every man of any account rushes for a
seat in the Assembly, where there is already
enough talent and enough democratic principle
to go on with, and leaves the Upper House in
the~ hands of the same old gang. Also every
man of note has views about test questions for
Assembly elections, when the only test question
worth considering is how to give the people’s
representatives power to do anything on any
question whatever. The Bulletin’s idea of a
good, hydra-headed test question for next As-
sembly is, payment of M’sL.C. ; abolition of
property qualification for M’sL.C. ; manhood
suffrage at Council elections ; the two Houses
to dissolve or expire by effluxion of time simul-
taneously ; Upper House to be elected by the
whole population of Victoria voting as one
constituency ; if the Council doesn’t pass this
Bill (which it won’t), then the Assembly to


appeal to the J. Bull Government for a new
Constitution Act, even if it is only one creating
a nominee Council, and meanwhile to include
provision for payment of M’sL.C. on the Esti-
mates. If the Council rejects the Estimates,
then let chaos supervene and see what will
happen. If the British Parliament won’t pass
a new Constitution Act, then the only result
will be more chaos. There is almost certain
to be a spell of chaos anyhow before the
Leg. Council is shifted from its obstructive
position, but until it is shifted there is very
little good in talking of land-values taxation or
any other radical reform. And if, in the confu-
sion, the interest on the public debt goes in
arrear, and the assets of the Fat Man’s banks
deteriorate a good deal, and these institutions
begin to crumble about his ears—well, it is im-
possible to indulge in the luxury of chaos with-
out breaking something. The Bulletin
doesn’t profess to say what the damage would
amount to, or how much success the great up-
heaval would really pan out for ; what it does
say is that if Victoria wants a test question to
raise at next general election this is the biggest
and most urgent one of all. Also, it is practi-
cally the only one, for it includes all the others.
A Matter of Theology. V
There is a whole volume of bitter satire in the
Buntine will-case, decided the other day by
Judge A’Beckett, in Melbourne. Buntine, a
crazy old religionist of the most aggressive big-
drum order, died leaving most of his pile to the
Salvation Army. His will was disputed, as a
matter of course, and after much evidence and
many columns of argument, it was set aside on
the ground that the testator was a confused
maniac and not responsible for his actions.
'Hie principal evidence of Buntine’s insanity—
the evidence on which the case really turned—
was that he was constantly meeting the devil,
and that he would frequently go long distances
out of his way to avoid Mephistopheles when
he saw him on the road ahead ; therefore the law
decides that a man who habitually meets a mate-
rial devil is a madman. Also, as the decision has
not aroused strong public protest, even among
religious sects, it seems that the public tacitly
acquiesces in this view ; at least it isn’t suffi-
ciently hostile to kick against it. This sort of
thing makes a bad bash of modern theology.
The orthodox community teaches and professes
to believe that the devil used to be plainly
visible some few thousand years ago, yet though
he hasn’t changed at all, it refuses to believe
that he can be visible now. It professes to be-
lieve in a material devil, yet when he is seen
standing at a cross-read with his tail behind
him it sets down the man who saw him as a
lunatic. Its faith is that the man who saw cer-
tain things, say, 4000 years ago, was a seer,
and the man who sees the same things
now should be run into a lunatic asylum.
These matters don’t look well when set side by
side. It is easy to believe, in a placid, un-
thinking fashion, that something happened 40
centuries ago, because it is a long way off and
there is a general feeling that anything might
have happened when it is so remote that no-
body can prove that it didn’t happen ; but
when the same thing begins happening to-day
the weird awfulness of it becomes apparent.
The Bulletin respectfully asks Judge
A’Beckett if he believes, after the good old
Scriptural manner, in the material devil who
appeared about the year 1 ? If so, why doesn’t
he believe in the material devil who is said to
have appeared in the year 1896? If one is
feasible and the other isn’t, there must be some
intermediate date when the devil left off ap-
pearing, and some reason why he left off
appearing. If Mr. A’Beckett doesn’t know that
reason and that date, how does he know
that the devil doesn’t appear now ? Why does
he believe in the visions of Ezekiel and refuse
to believe in those of Buntine? Would he
have upset the prophet Ezekiel’s will also if it
had come before him ? In short, will somebody
state, on behalf of modern orthodoxy, how far
back the thing that is impossible now becomes
possible, or how far forward the thing that
used to be possible becomes impossible ? Is
modern theology prepared to rule a streak
across history, and say straight out that on the
far side of it lie visions and dreams and miracles
and incarnations and material devils, and that
on the near side lies only the hard, dull, prac-
tical world of bread and cheese and beer and
bicycles and people named J. uSmith? Or is
it prepared to assert, in the absence of a definite
streak, that there is a definite shading of one
epoch into another, and if so where the shading
began and where it left off? There must be
some date far enough back for Buntine to be
possible, and some one far enough forward for
Jonah to be impossible, and if some authority
would only fix that date it would clear up quite
a large-sized mystery.
A Legal Definition.
The New South Wales courts have, to some ex-
tent, got over the principal difficulty in the
way of an enforcement of the province’s anti-
gambling law. The statute which has created
all the trouble sets forth that it is unlawful to
use for the purpose of certain gambles any
house, office, room, or other place,” and ever
since it was passed there has been a constant
struggle to find out what, in a strictly legal
sense, is a place. The common acceptation is
that a place is a spot, a bit of ground of any
size, a building, room, structure, street, square,
wharf, continent, empire, desert, paddock,
allotment, wilderness, balloon, coal-pit, gully,
kingdom, anything that a man can stand on or
stand in, or that he can go to or come away
from, a locality, region, geographical expres-
sion, and, in short, that a place is anything
that can be remained on or sat on or resided
on or in or built upon or used to tip
rubbish on, and various other things beside. In
short, a place is anywhere and everywhere.
This is the constant, old-established interpre-
tation, but the law in its learned and useless
profundity professed itself unable till the other
day to decide what was a place, and a vast
number of gambling law - breakers escaped
because the courts couldn’t decide whether the
place they were gambling in was really a place
or not. It never once offered to explain what
kind of Diace it might be if it wasn’t a place,
but the law is built that way ; its capacity for
deciding that something isn’t legally what it
seems to be is illimitable, but it has no capacity
at all for deciding what it is. The other
day, however. Judge Cohen, of N.S. Wales,
rudely burst up the fine old legal fiction
which has done so much service and sup-
plied the wherewithal for so large a quantity
of costs. He decided in a plain, off-hand
manner that a place was simply a spot; that
the fact that a certain gambler was standing on
something instead of floating in the air showed
that he was standing on a place ; that the place
he was standing on was a good enough place for
the purposes of the Act: and that in future, so
far as Judge Cohen was concerned, a place was
simply a place and nothing more nor less.
Judge Cohen’s law (said to be based on certain
recent English decisions) looks good enough for
any ordinary, every-day purpose, and if it holds
good it will henceforth be possible to prosecute
every betting-man, unless the scene of his
operations is specially exempted by law, it
being decided that everybody has some place
underneath him to afford" support, and the man
being there the place can be taken for granted.
The fact that it has taken years to arrive at
this idea is an eloquent tribute to the learned-
ness of the law, even if it doesn’t say much for
its plain, every-day usefulness.
No Liability.
A Westralian co., with a nominal capital of
,£30,000 in £1 shares, finds itself, according to
the special report of the auditors, with 32,000
odd shares ; and there is also a probable short-
age of £l7OO or so of call-money. The secre-
tary had the misfortune to die, hence these
“ disclosures.” The auditors’ report shows
that when the co. thought about getting to
work on the “mine” it had something under
£5OO in hand, and that before its first general
meeting a call had to be made. After that,
having only 24,000 shares to make calls on and
there being a board and a secretary to pay, and
the pretence of mining to be kept up (though
suspension of labor conditions is easily enough
got), monthly calls were necessary and were
accordingly made, although naturally they
weren’t responded to—to any particular extent.
In these circumstances the mine, even though it
be a second Mt. Morgan, was foredoomed to
failure—as 999 out of every 1000 co’s are that are
floated and registered under the Ho Liability
Mining Co.’s Act. When a co. with £30,000 of
paper capital and with 10 or 15 acres of barren-
looking country as its only other asset, pro-
fesses to commence to prospect and develop its
“ mine ” on an empty cash-box the whole thing,
so far as legitimate mining goes, resolves itself
into a farce. Directors and secretary—unless,
as rarely happens, they are infatuated fools—
know that the real business of the co. is to
manufacture scrip to gamble with ; they know
that the “mine” is as thorough a blind as the
empty cigar-boxes are in the window of the
tote-shop. But while you do have a chance
of a div. from the tote-shop, the only profit to
be got out of the “ mining ” scrip is what you
may make by selling for more than you gave
for it a piece of paper representing nothing in
particular. It is, therefore, a comparatively
insignificant thing whether there are 30,000 or
50,000 shares in your co. Everybody is busy
making or trying to make his “bit” out of
anybody else who may think the boom will
last a little longer yet ; and if in the midst
of the unholy scramble the officials are
not often detected in making their “ bit ”
by the simple process of over-issuing intrinsi-
cally valueless scrip, it is probably because
the co. dies and not the sec. Meantime, while
the co. lasts the directors, knowing that it is
absurd to seriously expect divs. from a mine
which is entirely dependent for its prospecting
fund upon calls that will cease to come in as
soon as ever the market boom is over, fritter the
call money away—or otherwise dispose of it. And
when the market is worked out they wind up
the concern (their own nominee being liquidator)
and abandon the property. And thereby they
often damn what is honestly a fair prospect.
All this is not only rendered possible but is
ministered to by the No Liability Mining Cos.
Acts of the several provinces, with their provi-
sions by which a shareholder may drop out at
any. time he pleases, and by the absence of any
provision insisting upon a fair percentage of the
capital being actually available for prospecting
and mining before registration is granted.
Also, it might conduce to a little more
honesty and care in the issue of scrip, &c., if it
were necessary for the almost inevitable liquida-
tion to be conducted by State officials.
The “Drunken Loafer.”
The Maoriland Conservative party lodges a
general complaint against the Old Age Pension
idea because it doesn’t duly and properly recog-
nise the great virtue of Thrift. “It makes no
distinction,” is the general burden of the
plaint, “ between the drunken loafer who
wasted all his money, and the hard-working
man who attempted to preserve his indepen-
dence,” &c., &c. When the drunken loafer and
the hard-working man both reach the age of 65,
and are equally qualified by residence in the
province for the requisite number of years,
they will get the same pension, and the Tory
party, with its innate reverence for Thrift, re-
gards this as very wrong indeed. Yet there is
nothing especially remarkable or unfair about
the situation after all, and even the drunken
loafer has certain claims to consideration. The
fund for old-age pension purposes must come
out of revenue, and one of the principal items
of revenue is the beer and spirit duty. The
drunken loafer contributes a very substantial
share of this in one way and another; there-
fore he will probably supply as large a propor-
tion of the pension -fund as the average indivi-
dual. So long as he does this, the redness of
his nose, and his grog-blossoms and other
drawbacks, don’t authorise anybody to do him
less than strict justice. Again, the community
must support him anyhow when he becomes too
old and feeble to support himself by hard loaf-
ing any longer ; it must support him, either in
gaol, or in an inebriate retreat, or a benevolent
asylum, or a place for lunatics, or by miscel-
laneous charity, or otherwise— "otherwise” in-
cluding the mysterious disappearance of fowls,
&c., out of the back yard—and it will probably
cost as little to maintain him by the pen-
sion system as any other way. The pen-
sion system is partly devised, too, for the
benefit of the people who don’t draw pensions;
the spectacle of any very old man or woman
slowly pegging out from want and exposure is
unsesthetic and unpicturesque, and makes an
objectionable foreground to the beautiful
scenery of Maoriland, and if the spectacle has
been a drunkard and an idler in previous years,
he is unpicturesque and unsesthetic, and not
agreeable to look at all the same. Another
point is that drink is alleged by all right-think-
ing persons to shorten existence ; therefore the
hard and useless drinker is all the less likely to
live to draw his pension, or at least to live to
draw it for many years. If he does put less
into the pension-fund, he will probably, by a
judicious sinkage into a beery grave, draw less
out, which partially balances things. Probably
be will be quite as little of a tax on the com-
munity, in proportion to his numbers, as any
other man, partly because he is more liable to
early death through falling downstairs, or being
run over by a dray, or through snakes ; partly
because he can’t be beggared in his old age
through the awful depreciation of his Bank of
N.Z. shares, seeing that he won’t have any,
and thus he avoids one of the great causes
which bring the thrifty man into financial
trouble. Again, when he gets his pension he
will probably spend it in drink, and 15s. a week
spent in drink contributes twice as much to the
revenue as 15s. spent any other way, therefore
the State will get more of his pension money
back than it will get of the other man’s. Also,
his pension stops while he is in gaol for being
drunk, which is another source of economy to
which the respectable pensioner won’t contri-
bute. And, in any case, a drunken loafer re-
ceiving 15s. a week from the State in his old
age costs the country far less than a thrifty
person who draws £2OO a year or £2OOO in rents
and spends them as an absentee in England.
Altogether, so far as the Old Age Pension
scheme goes, the drunken loafer has quite a
lot of redeeming features which he seldom
gets credit for.
Freetrade in Lav.
Apropos of Attorney-General Kingston’s pro-
posal to do away with all but purely legal
examinations for admission to Shark Bay, how
is it that all legal reformers bow down so to
the fetish of examinations and articles ? Is
either necessary at all ? English barristers,
held by some to be the pick of the world, have
been admitted to their profession until lately
without examination at all, practically the only
requisite being attendance at certain meals for
certain periods of the year. And, more signi-
ficant still for us, scores of such barristers have
been admitted in Australasia and have practi-
cally led our bars since the settlement, and
some of them have filled and really adorned
our judgment seats —without either examination
or articles ! Others of them have gone forth
over the world to fill legal and judicial positions
in countries with juristic systems different from
our own, and mainly with success. Again,
difficult legal positions all over this and every
other country are filled by men who have passed
no legal examinations and gone through no
blackmailing articles ; to say nothing of the
hosts of managing clerks, and the legions of
unarticled clerks in solicitors’ offices. In
Australasia daily, shire secretaries, managers
of banks and companies, managers of trustee
associations, clerks of courts and permanent
heads of departments, do the bulk of their legal
work without any hall-marked assistance, and
work smoothly through the difficulties of com-
plicated and contradictory legislation without
recognised legal training at all. A raw con-
stable promoted to be an officer will often do
more legal work, unassisted, in a fortnight than
a junior barrister does in a year. There’s a
great deal of bogey about the law, and nowhere
more than in this insistance on the necessity of
examinations and articles. The main effect of
them is to confine the plums to a few people who
were fortunate enough to get a good education
in their youth, and to those who can afford to
pay heavy premiums for their articles. Sweep
away both and the result will astonish the
legal profession in more ways than one, and will
certainly result in something like decency in the
amounts of bills of costs.
Justice Williams has made some lamentably
absurd remarks upon the working of the Im-
prisonment for Debt Act in Victoria. “ Ninety
per cent, of fraud summonses,” said the learned
innocent, “ when brought before Judges of the
Supreme Court were dismissed. Personally, he
could say that he dismissed 95 out of every 100
brought before him. They were simply, in
most instances, mere instruments of torture.”
The Bulletin, which is certainly not a quixo-
tic champion of the legal profession, must heg
to protest against this insult to solicitors in
general. A fraud summons, as a rule, repre-
sents a lawyer’s honest opinion, also his client’s
honest opinion, that the summoned party is an
unprincipled dodger, and this opinion, as a
rule, is quite justified by the facts of the
case. When Judge Williams takes credit
for defeating 95 out of every 100 at-
tempts to frighten money out of debtors,
his Honor is altogether too rough on human
nature. The desire to squeeze blood out of a
stone by legal process is not nearly so common
as the disposition to escape payment of debts
by false protestations of impecuniosity. Because
Judge Williams accepts such protestations it
doesn’t follow that a sceptical creditor is a vin-
dictive beast, with a rascally attorney urging
him on to an act of barbarism. The creditor
and his legal adviser are, as often as not, in-
fluenced by considerations which cannot be put
effectively into evidence. They know that the
defendant is a liar, whereas the Judge is merely
supposing that he speaks truth. Proceedings
for the recovery of debts are seldom carried
as far as the fraud summons stage unless
the plaintiff is smarting under a sense of
injustice. 1 lie fact that a fraud summons is
a notoriously difficult point to achieve would
deter him from risking further costs if there
were not some grounds for expecting a favor-
able decision. Sometimes the fraud summons
is an instrument of torture. But as long as
the credit system and fraud exist in the world
the deserving creditor—there are such things as
deserving creditors—will need a little protec-
tion, and Victoria is a part of the world where
he needs much more of it than has fallen to his
lot these last few years. Judge Williams may
as well remember that the local Supreme Court
hasn’t earned a brilliant reputation for wisdom
and justice in dealing with fraud cases.

Dear Bulletin, —Where is the use of the
inspection of stock, anyway? Tuberculous and
cancered cattle may not be sold in the markets,
but they get down our throats just the same.
The station near where I live boils down all its
diseased bovines, and feeds large herds of pigs
on “ bouilli.” The pigs about a year ago broke
out in hideous tumors. Those that didn’t were
packed off at once to market, and killed before
they developed the outward and visible signs
of the loathsome diseases which no doubt
lurked in their blood. Is there no way
of stopping this? I hear many stations do
likewise—but I only speak of what I know.
Another effect of this delightful industry is to
teach all the small selectors to fatten their pigs
on wallaby (raw, and frequently full of in-
testinal worms). Five years ago most selectors
in this district fed their porkers on milk, corn,
lucerne, etc. Now it is wallaby, with just a
little good food to finish it off. If the pig and
bacon trade of N.S. Wales is to be worth any-
thing to the country, this state of things must
be put down suddenly and with violence. I
say nothing about the hygienic vie tv of the case
—though probably the near future will hold
much joy for the doctors. The name of the
station (in the hands of a very big bank) is
given below—“ not necessarily for publication,’
etc., etc.—A.B. (N.S.W.)
Vic. Upper House has been slowly talking the
Companies Bill to death for four months at the
rate of about five clauses a night. The customary
order of things is that clause 21 is struck out,
clause 22 amended so as to be of no value, and
clauses 23, 24, and 25 postponed for future con-
sideration. Then, about 9.30 p.m., the Council
reports that it is dog-tired with watching over
the interests of its suffering country, and it goes
to bed. The latest improvement is to make
directors responsible if they “willingly” issue
false balance-sheets, instead of “ knowingly, or
with gross negligence.” This is beautifully
comprehensive, for even the most villainous
kind of director only issues his faked sheet very
unwillingly. He doesn’t do it cheerfully, or for
the fun of the thing; he would much rather
know that the document was true, and save
himself the trouble of complicated lying to hide
past misdeeds which he can’t afford to reveal.
Therefore, when only the director who lies will-
ingly is responsible, no director is responsible
at all. No one commits a crime willingly ; he
does it reluctantly, because he can’t get the ad-
vantages of it otherwise.
Writes “Alumnus” :
There is a heap of truth in N.S.W. Lands Minister Car-
rutiiers’ remark, made recently at Berrigan, about the
metropolis existing almost as an octopus on the com-
munity. The alleged policy of N.S.W. is Freetrade. The
actual policy is an endeavor to force the growth of Svdney
and protect its interests at the expense of the rest of the
province. To centralise all government in the metropolis,
the establishment of Local Government has been de-
ferred to the Greek Kalends. As regards trade, the rail-
ways are the tentacles of the metropolitan octopus. The
trade that, if left to itself, would flow naturally towards
Adelaide, Melbourne, or Brisbane is lured to Sydney by
means of differential rates or other concessions. Cheap
excursion trains draw the country people to spend their
money in Sydney shops, and the parcel-post enables the
city retailers to successfully compete with the country
storekeepers. Then, special trains run gratis daily, bearing
the city newspapers to try and influence country opinion
in the interests of Sydney. The country lias' to work
hard amid all the troubles of bush life— e.q., floods,
droughts, bush fires, rabbits, tick, footrot, rust, &c., and
to keep expenses low in order that the absentee land-
lord, mortgagee and bank depositor, who live in the city,
may enjoy rents and interests. But the worst of it is
that the city, with its meretricious attractions, is ever
bleeding the country of the flower of its young man and
womanhood, for the city folk would die out in a few
generations unless blended with fresh country blood.
Minister Carruthers said the Government wished to take
people out of the crowded metropolis and place them on
the land. Its method of doing this is by despatching the
city unemployed with a free pass on the railways
to compete at starvation rates with bush labor
or to reduce by begging the scanty living of
the settler. It is the city, mercantile, and land owning
class that benefited mainly by the lavish outlay of bor-
rowed money to meet interest on which the country’s
produce is heavily weighted; Altogether it is difficult 'to
see how the country can get free of the octopus grasp, for
the city interest is compact and has the ear of the Govern-
ment, especially when it is a Freetrade one, while the
country interest is distant and disunited ; but much can
be done by decentralisation of government, by penal taxa-
tion of large estates, by allowing trade to’ flow in its
natural channels, by safeguarding the homestead from
seizure, and by recognising the basic truth that the grow-
ing of men on the soil and not the heaping up of wealth
in the city will alone make of Australia a great and strong
nation.
The Salvation Army’s new contract, writes
“ Macassar ” to The Bulletin, is a bigger one
than it has the ghost of an idea of. “There
are 40,000,000 people in the Indian Archi-
pelago,” blares Booth ; “and who is to know
how many of these are Christ’s ? The Army
is going to find out—starting with Java, Suma-
tra, Borneo, the Philippines, and Singapore.”
Now, all these places I know, and here are
some of the things'the Army is going to find
out: With the still pagan portion of the popu-
lation it may perhaps do something by virtue
of its shouting, and singing, and dancing, and
prancing ; of the all-pervading Chinaman, also,
it will doubtless here and there make a bogus
convert; but upon the prevailing faith
of the Archipelago, Mahometanism, it will
make no more impression than a zephyr upon a
rock. The fantastic methods by which it has
succeeded with the masses of the West are the
very things that will cut the throat of its in-
fluence with the subtle and contemplative Chil-
dren of the Prophet. Also, though in British
Borneo and Singapore the Bloody-Fiery cult
will doubtless be allowed to caper to its hearts’
content, it will find that in Sumatra, Java, and
Celebes the Dutch authorities won’t tolerate too
demonstrative a solicitude about the souls of the
indigenes ; while, as for the Philippines, no
preaching or teaching or screeching that is not
Catholic will be there permitted for a moment.
The Harmy, of course, delights in opposition,
but a simple deportation- order by the Captain-
General would speedily settle all that. The
new Australian “ Commandant ” evidently
dunno where ’e are, this time.

The “Milk-White Flag,” which is filling
in the last days of Hoyt’s comedians at Sydney
Lyceum, is rather a pleasant piece of frivolity, on
the whole. It concerns a corps of very high-class
militia, who are organised for the purpose of wear-
ing a military title and a beauteous uniform, and
drinking much cocktail. There is only one private,
and he forms himself into a hollow square on
review days—there are no fighting days, for the
corps has a comprehensive medical certificate on
hand, to the effect that its chest won’t stand
exposure. This glittering force gets strangely
mixed up with an alleged corpse on ice, and the
doings of the corpse are too weird for expression.
There is some decent music in the “Milk-White
Flag,” and otherwise it consists mostly of irre-
sponsible frivolity. It is a thing which, if done
solidly and slowly, would be simply awful; when
done with a rattle and a rush and a bang it is a
joyful trifle of gossamer and gush, and fills in an
evening very pleasantly. As Hoyt’s comedians
pack up and depart from this continent, however,
shortly after this appears in print, this notice is
more a valedictory than anything else.
* * * *
The new piece started with bad luck.
Miss Sadie M‘Donald, the pretty, irrepressible
Flirt of “ Chinatown,” appeared on the first night
of the new production, and put more life and soul
and energy into her part than was usual even with
her. Then she went home and died six hours
later. The cause of her death was brain paralysis,
arising, it was said, from a spinal injury sustained
in Melbourne while practising a handspring or
some similar calisthenics at rehearsal. But the
post-mortem made it plain that apoplexy was the
fatal malady. The mercurial little woman was
but 22 years old, and her final illness lasted some-
thing less than an hour in all.
** * *
The “Merchant of Venice,” at Sydney
Lyceum, draws as large a crowd as could be ex-
pected considering that two theatres are trying
to supply the very limited demand for Shake-
speare. The “ Merchant ” undoubtedly de-
serves to be a big success. It depends mainly on
Shylock and not too much on Mrs. Potter ; and
Belle*v’s Shylock is worth the admittance money
twice over. He is a well-considered character all
round, with the glare of avarice in his eye, and
the rieh, moist accents of Manasseh on his lips,
and the eager aspect of the buzzard on his bird-
like countenance, and the straggling, frothy beard
of one who has grown old while collecting the bill,
and when he proceeds to sell up the reconstructed
Antonio for the overdraft he comes very near to
real greatness. Somehow the sympathy of the
bankers and financiers in the d.c. is all with
Antonio in this scene, which is a proof of the
unaccountableness of human nature. Antonio
was wont to lend without interest; he was a cheap
money scheme —a sort of old Venetian credit-
foncier, while Shylock represented private enter-
prise, and was half-brother to the Q.N. Bank, and
a near relation of British Capital. Yet the finan-
cial community seems to really imagine that it
sympathises with Antonio, which is wholly im-
probable, and when it hears that he was accus-
tomed to publicly kick and maltreat the private
enterprise man it looks glad all over.
Scot Inglis’s Antonio is another very fine
character. The gorgeous robes of old Venice hang
well upon him, and his deep voice fills the pre-
mises with music, and he exposes a highly-pro-
mising chest when Shylock is going to collect
the overdue promissory-note with the carving-
knife. Portia, however, isn’t an overwhelming
success by any means, though she is a very re-
spectable failure, and she doesn’t fail the same
way any other lady would. Mrs. Potter wants the
youthful freshness which should go with the part.
She is beautiful, with the tired beauty of one who
has long been fainting at the handle as she turned
the weary grindstone of dramatic art; there is a
sameness about her jaded smile and about the
sidelong, upward look of her eyes, and though she
plays Mrs. Potter well enough she isn’t an ideal
Portia by a long way. Apart from these three no
one matters very much, but most of the other
characters do their parts well enough. Mont-
gomery and Cyril Keightly deserve a friendly
mention ; and Tubal, the wormy Jew, who looks
as if he had been stepped upon by the foot of
despotism for 1000 years and hadn’t turned once,
is played in an artistically crushed fashion by
Wilson Forbes. There is room to say something
moderately severe about Jessica and the sketchy
Lorenzo, and the shadowy outline of Salanio, but
they are hereby released with a caution. The
“ Merchant of Venice ” is a good summer produc-
tion. There is much water-frontage in it; the
salt Adriatic looks cool and greeny-blue, and the
shadows cast by the great masses of Venetian
architecture are pleasant to look upon, and the
wings of the bronze lions of St. Mark help to blow
away the summer flies, and altogether the play is
refreshing to the eye in its purely pictorial aspect.
** * *
George Rignold returned to his faithful
city of Sydney in due course, and put up “ Henry
V.” at the Royal before an audience which was
reasonably large and quite as enthusiastic as any
Shakespearian audience ever is nowadays. It was
unaffectedly glad to see its military hero back
again, and the warrior got a reception which was
calculated to bring joy to his soul. “ Henry V.”
is not such a novelty in Sydney as it was at its
recent Melbourne production ; in fact, it has been
done very often and very persistently, and more
than once it has been received with something like
a suspicion of weariness and a leaning to go out
and bury the whole subject in drink. But it is a
beautiful and wonderful pageant anyhow, and
Rignold’s King is so excellent a piece of work that
he never grows entirely stale. It says a great
deal for G.R. that he is almost the only actor in
this world who seems able to permanently keep
alive a Shakespearian historical drama, No one
struggles seriously nowadays with “John” or
“Richard II.” or “ Henry IV.” or “ Henry VI.”
or “Henry VIII.” All these potentates have
dropped more or less permanently dead on the
gory field of literature, and have gone under seem-
ingly for good. “Richard III.” still comes up to
breathe now and then, but he comes up at longer
and longer intervals, and goes down again more
and more suddenly. Of all Shakespeare’s historical
characters, “ Henry V.” is the only one who leads
what may be called a permanent exist-
ence, and it is George Rignold who
keeps him alive. Of late years “ Henry
V.” may not have repaid any too
lavishly the man who preserves him
from extinction, but Rignold still
stages him with all his accustomed care
and accuracy. When that veteran actor
quits the scene, and Henry, in his coat
of brass and iron, no longer rattles like
a crate of agitated hardware across the
landscape, and his coat of mail with its
iron tail is reverently laid away with
his dusty bones, there will be a big gap
in Shakespearian art, and the bard will
have made another long stride towards
oblivion.
* * *
In the present “ Henry V.” Rig-
nold is as good as he ever was, and con-
sidering the very fine work he has done
for years past on the blood-stained
field of Agincourt it is impossible to
say anything much more flattering.
The Bulletin doesn’t suppose for a
moment that the real Henry was any-
thing like Mr. Rignold, but that merely
showed his want of foresight. The real
Henry, in fact, was mainly an Awful
Example. He came down heavily on
his insane contemporary of France
when the latter, being a hopeless idiot,
couldn’t defend himself. Then, as the
conquest progressed but slowly, he
married the daughter of his crazy
victim so as to further secure the inherit-
ance, and the natural result of the
alliance that united two kingdoms was
a crazy son who dropped them both.
Henry V., with his epileptic father,
and his insane father-in-law, and his
more or less crack-brained wife, and
his crazed son, and his she-fiend mother-
in-law—the Bavarian lady of loose
habits who was rushed off to her grave
in a cart amid the execrations of
everybody who knew him, and his
bloated and pimpled brother-in-law who chucked
out the crazy son aforementioned, and his own
tendency to something that is vaguely alleged
to have been leprosy, was a doomed man
with squalid woe stalking behind and before—
wherefore The Bulletin feels that he didn’t look
at all like G. Rignold. A lot of other people help
Rignold in this want of resemblance. Miss
Hughes is one of those who deserves special
notice. Also, Hawthorne, as Fluellen, and
Sweeney are much above par, and Plimmer,
Diver and some more are commendable heroes who
clank with more or less martial tread down the
paths of history.

“The only authorised Cinematographe,”
now open at Sydney Criterion, is a matter of serious
local interest, inasmuch as it includes the Melb.
Cup finish and various other Australianisms.
Artistically, it is a big success in some places and
a moderate one in others. Some of the pictures
are painfully jumpy and some are hazy, but, on
the whole, they are a respectable collection. One
or two of the Cup-scenes are, pictorially, the
worst features in it. They represent a stream of
people drifting by, and consist mainly of hats and
umbrellas. Still, there are alleviations. The
arrival of the train is beautifully realistic ; and so
is the spectacle of Lady Brassey trying to rope in
Newhaven with the blue ribbon, and that animal
striving to dodge her, and bobbing at times right
out of the picture, and then backing into it again.
A final picture of Newhaven, with his jockey and
trainer, is distinctly excellent. The Cup itself,
however, is far-off and shadowy and indistinct,
and the lawn and paddock scenes are mostly hats
and gamps, as aforementioned, and the painful
sameness of the Australian hat is like unto the
weariness of the gum-tree and the sassafras. A
view of Manly wharf, “French infantry on the
march,” and a _ “ Baby’s Quarrel ” are three gems,
and the latter is the most interesting thing in the
collection. Taking it all round, the “only autho-
rised Cinematographe ” is more than good enough
for the money.

Sydney Tivoli announces the “continued
appearance ” of all its stars, and the first appear-
ance of “ Little May Flower. ” Also there is an
entire change of programme. An amateur co.
announces three fashionable nights (December 9,
10, and 12) of “ Mikado,” at Sydney Criterion, on
behalf of the Moses Montefiore Jewish Home, the
Firm having lent the scenery and all effects in
aid of the good cause of charity. And with a
view to Xmas various other shows are beginning
to hum in the near distance.
** * *
James MacMahon’s Cinematographe, at
237 Pitt-street, Sydney, still booms with a great
and well-deserved boom. The pictures come and
go, all but one —the skirt-dancer in her rainbow
colors—and she appears built to go on for ever.
The demand for the skirt-dancer is practically
unlimited ; aud when we consider the enthusiasm
evoked by this whirling mass of flounces and
skirts, and giddy, tossing scrap of soft humanity,
the complete hopelessness of the W.C.T.U. move-
ment begins to be visible. James MacMahon
might put up gratis a picture of a severe female
in mittens and blue goggles walking across the
canvas with a tract under her arm, and keep
putting it up gratis from now till the crack of
doom, without exciting any gratitude in anybody.
But his audiences fall down and worship the
dancing, empty-headed charmer in the flying
muslins, and if an attempt is made to withdraw
her even once they threaten to rise en masse and
boot the whole machine into the middle of the
Age of Consent or something. It is no use argu-
ing against an accomplished fact, especially a
pink-and-white fact with great black eyes and
innumerable flounces.
HARRY CONOR, as Bonaparte, in “A Milk White
Flag ” (Sydney Lyceum).
Manager Goodman’s ‘ ‘ complimentary tes-
timonial matinee ” comes off at Sydney Lyceum
this (Thursday) afternoon, with the patronage of
his and her Ex. the Governor, his other Ex., the
Admiral; the officers of the squadron, Chief-Jus-
tice Darley, Premier Reid, the Ministry generally,
Major-Gen. French and staff, the Judges—all of
them—the mayor and corporation, Critchett
Walker, and many others. All the leading
members of all the companies of all the Sydney
theatres are on the programme, and stupendous
proceedings are expected.

The Broughs return to Sydney Criterion
at Xmas with four completely new plays, “Nancy
and C 0.,” “A Woman’s Reason,” “Mrs. Othello,”
and “Godpapa.” H. R. Roberts, formerly
Maggie Moore’s leading man, and one Ferris from
England are new members of the co. Also, it is
reported that manager Mayne has just become a
grandfather for the first time.

“ Mrs. Ponderbury’s Past,” at Melbourne
Bijou, is an improvement upon the Sydney pro-
duction, insofar that Miss Watt-Tanner now
plays the rampageous heroine, vice Mrs. Brough.
The present wife of Ponderbury has physical
points in her favor. She was built for the char-
acter, and when the subjugated Brough cowers
before her one feels that any other man would do
the same thing. Also it seems probable that
the lawful owner of so large a bride would be glad
to seek a change of scene by gazing through
a gap in the garden wall whilst the ordinary-
sized lady next door was bathing al fresco. In
other respects “ Mrs. Ponderbury’s Past ” is not
more probable than the average farcical comedy,
although it is distinctly giddier. But for it hap-
pening immediately after “ A Mother of Three,”
The Bulletin might term this an improper
story. Under the circumstances it may be
accepted as a well-meant endeavor to let the pub-
lic down gently. The change to a mild, unsug-
gestive farcical comedy would have been too
sudden.
* • * *
Brough and Miss Watt Tanner, as the two
Ponderburys, are the beginning, end, and most
of the middle part of the Bijou show. They push
the joke along as far as it will go, without any
appearance of effort. Miss Emma Temple im-
personates capably the lady who undresses herself
on the other side of the garden wall, and Miss
Hardy appears to advantage as a niece. There is,
indeed, very little fault to find with “Mrs. Pon-
derbury’s Past ” in the matter of acting, which
remark applies to a sentimental curtain-raiser en-
titled ‘ ‘ Dream Faces. ’ ’ All the same, The Bulle*
tin expects to chronicle a change of bill shortly.

At the Royal, a hard, unflinching sergeant
continues to trample Walter Baker’s philabeg in
the dust amidst the jeers of several ungrateful
supers. “ One of the Best ” may run a third
week, partly on its spectacular merits, and chiefly
because it is by far the largest entertainment
offered in Melbourne at the price.

At the Princess’s, they have undertaken to
run Stars of all Nations for another fortnight,
in the face of convincing evidence that the new
variety company is a square peg in a round hole.
Meanwhile, Harry Rickards, at the Opera House,
has added Chirgwin to his substantial bill, and a
few remarks on the almost certain success of the
blacked minstrel who wears a white eye will
appear in due course.
At Poverty Point.
The Age mentions that Chanter, the late Mrs. Scott
Siddons’ husband, has for many years been in a Melb.
lunatic asylum. I happened to be at Melb. lock-up
when he was fetched in by the police. He was a very
handsome, or rather a pretty man, a trifle dolly, and his
direct trouble was liquor. Dick Thatcher managed for
Mrs. Siddons awhile, but her right-hand man for many
years was Mighty Atom MacMahon. By the way, when
Mrs. Scott-Siddons married him, Chanter had a splendid
London official position.
The presentation of a laurel-wreath to King George
Rignold by his co. as a token of their admiration of his
performance as Henry V. was an interesting ceremony.
But nobody explained what George is expected to do with
the wreath. Obviously he can’t eat it; laurel smells after
a while ; it gathers dust; he can’t wear it on his head ;
it is too uneven for a night-cap, and it won’t fit as a
collar.
Probably the most delicate compliment ever paid to an
Australian actor was that paid by Du Maurier, author of
“ Trilby,” to Geo. Darrell. George started out to play
Svenga'li, and Du Maurier died the very next day.
Oscar Wilde is to be released before the coming April.
Physically and mentally he has suffered severely from his
imprisonment, and the rigorous enforcement, of the
“ silent system.” An enteric disorder afflicts him, and
he cannot assimilate the prison food. His wife, who has
an income of £BOO per annum, waits his release, to seek
with him the obscurity of some small continental town,
or perhaps Australia will be the chosen haven. In
appearance, the brain-distorted Wilde was the image of
a fellow-disciple in Melbourne, who died twelve or more
years ago.
It is reported that Wallace Brownlow has become land-
lord of the Exchange Hotel, Kalgoorlie.
Chirgwin, alike in his professional and domestic aspects,
earned the good word of everybody who came across him
aboard the Ophir, and had he gone on to Sydney as was
expected, an army of admirers from the ship would have
attended the Kaffir’s first night at the Tivoli. Chirgwin,
by the way, explains that his white eye was the result of
an accident, not an inspiration. One night, when some
dust had got into his optic, he rubbed the lids and ad-
jacent cheek bone with his thumb and finger, turning his
back to the audience the while. Facing them again he
was astonished to hear a general roar of laughter. He
had rubbed the black off his skin around the irritated eye.
The effect was funny. Next night and for ever after the
whitened triangular space, w 7 ith incidental business.
Knowles is not so droll as Wood (the “ somewhat dif-
ferent ” comedian) nor as funny as Whitburn, but he
scores faster than either of them.
Holdar M. : As the serio-comic heroine of the Perth
cane-cure will probably receive copious congratulation, a
dubious grunt suggested by certain cognate occurrences
which the affair' brings to mind may be in order. Some
music-hall artistes (usually ladies) frequently take per-
sonal liberties with the people who practically hire them.
To enhance the allusion of some ditty’s refrain they will
impertinently' select a conspicuous spectator as a target,
drawing upon the crushed individual the ridicule of the
audience. An occasional resentment of this raillery’ would
seem justified, apart altogether from the merits of this
particular case, concerning which the writer knows and
insinuates nothing.
Willie Walsh made his first bow in London at a concert
in connection with the Polytechnic Institute. His prin-
cipal success was secured in “ Let me like a soldier fall”
—a number to which Australian audiences have been fre-
quently treated by the tenor. For encore, he sang
“Take a pair of sparkling eyes,” and gained great ap-
plause. Walsh is reported to have exchanged that spirit
of expressionless interpretation which greatly marred his
best efforts in Australia for one of contrary kind.
A plebiscite concert for 9th instant is announced by
Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society, whose committee
invited subscribers to forward the names of pieces—per-
formed during the last two seasons —which would bear
repetition. The call was eagerly responded to, and after
much deliberation and an unnecessary outburst of
warmth on the part of several members of the committee,
certain selections were advertised as being both in har-
mony with the interests of the performers and in keeping
with the divergent tastes of a discriminating public.
Ada Crossley has gained countless new laurels in Eng-
land. In recognition of her fine singing of “Sunshine
and Rain," Blumenthal is specially composing a new song
for her.
There is what Australians call a kangaroo dog at the
Oxford Music Hall, London, that jumps over an obstacle
14ft. high nightly, and during the same “turn’ asecond
dog of this species, with a run and a “ take-off, clears

In 1864 Melb. Garrick Club was much concerned about
the tercentenary of the birth of Shakespeare, giving
amateur performances, issuing subscription-lists, and
petitioning Parliament on behalf of a statue to the Im-
mortal Bard. This enthusiasm (judging from certain
newspaper cuttings pasted in an old Garrick Club scrap-
book) was very furious while it lasted. Subscriptions to
the amount of £5OO were raised “ on paper,” and £74 was
actually collected. The scrap-book revelations break-olt
suddenly at this point, but it is pretty evident that the
Shakespeare statue scheme perished in its prime, ihe
£74 was probably expended upon melancholy drinkings
to the bard’s memory by a special committee.

The proposed union of the National Mutual
Life Association and the Mutual of Victoria (already
favorably commented on in Tub Bulletin of Nov. 28) pro-
mises to pan out successfully. The combined society is
to be called the National Mutual, the name of the smaller
institution being dropped. An investigation has assured
each party to the proposed combination that the
other is solvent. All the business of the Mutual of
Victoria will be taken over as it stands, therefore no
policy-holder can lose anything by the change, and the
members of both societies should gain a great deal by the
saving in working expenses and the consequent increase
of bonuses. This is the first attempt at such a combina-
tion in Australasia, though similar arrangements are
common enough in Britain and America, and if it is
carried out all parties concerned should profit materially.

The Queensland National Bank reconstruction
proposals now stand something as follows : —The share-
holders to be released from their liability (£360,000) on
uncalled capital; the private depositors to take over the
bank and the loss ; the Govt, fixed deposit of £2,000,000
or so to be extended, so that the last instalment won’t
fall due for 36 years; interest thereon to be at least 21- per
cent., and more if the profits allow ; the head office of the
bank to remain in Brisbane, and the Govt, to have powers
of audit, so that it can keep a steady eye on its £2,000,000.
These conditions are so very steep, that there is a fair
chance the private depositors will prefer to liquidate and
have done with the misery. There is a very large shortage
in the Q.N.8., and the profits will most likely be small
for a good many years. If the Govt, fixed its interest
definitely at 2i per cent, it might leave something for the
other creditors, but on the sliding-scale principle they may
get no interest or dividend for many years, the preferen-
tial creditor swallowing all the profits. If the depositors
take over the institution, it is now alleged that the biggest
share interest will be in England, and the English share-
holders may object to the head office being in Brisbane.
If the private depositors refuse the proposed terms they
may sell up sundry politicians for their unpaid calls, have
an enquiry which will involve others in awful trouble,
create a panic by forcible liquidation which may abso-
lutely ruin some highly respectable Fat Men already in
serious difficulties, badly damage the province’s credit in
England, and collect at least part of the £360,000 unpaid
capital. And if they forego these joys the State will give
them more time to pay up, and will take all the interest
it can get, but is willing that, beyond the minimum of 2£
per cent, it won’t take anything it can’t get. Looked at
in a coldly brutal fashion—is the bargain good enough ?
Of course, things might get worse instead of
better, and the depositors might have to liquidate on
worse terms in 1931 than in 1896. They might get more
by selling up the whole concern now than by accepting
the Government’s offer. Again, they might, if they made
sufficient row and created enough stench, exact better
terms than are offered to them. Also, they may consider
that the fearful joy of hauling up a whole lot of
influential politicians to make explanations is too
good a revenge to be sacrificed in exchange
for the present of an insolvent bank. They might
forego this pleasure, and release the old share-
holders, and then find that the institution was so
much worse than represented that all the assets would
only cover the State’s preferential claim, and they might
have the labor of nursing the great white elephant for
nothing at all. The Bank of N.Z. made about four con-
secutive full revelations of its losses before they all came
to light. Sundry other banks made “ample provision”
in ’93 by writing off their reserves, and are having further
revelations even yet. When the Q.N. Bank has had a few
more revelations there may not only "be nothing left for
private depositors, but the assets may not cover the
Government’s claims. There are a whole stack of weird
possibilities in such a case as this.
Dear Bulletin, — Has there ever been an inde-
pendent investigation of a bank in Australasia, which did
not result in “ Sensational Disclosures ” ? Federal, Mer-
cantile, City of Melbourne, 8.N.Z., Queensland National.
Can we say any bank is “ reliable ” ? “ Not found out ”
seems the more scientific term.—The Boobono.
* * * *
Contrast the blighting leaders in the Brisbane
press of late with regard to the Q.N. Bank and their
sycophantic utterances of a few years ago, when the
warning notes were first sounded. Then the hireling
scribe sought for flowery phrases and redundancy of
epithet to prove that “ all was right as right could be.”
Now this eagerness is all expressed in caustic references
to bygone mismanagement, and a hankering desire to
bury that helpless and hopeless institution. Verily the
worm that turns is a mere item compared to the press
that crawls.

That sad little institution, the Tasmanian Per-
manent Executors and Trustees Assn., looks as if it ought
to go out of its sad little business for good. Last half-
year’s profits were £ll7, against £494, £297, £356 and
£265 for four previous half-years. A 5 per cent, dividend
and tax thereon absorb £262, so the institution pays
away more than twice its earnings—the actual amount
realised isn’t much more than 2 per cent, per annum on
capital. The co. has £9615 of its own funds invested, and
as this, even at 3 per cent, per annum, should supply
£144, it would seem that the trustee business has yielded
absolutely nothing, or possibly less. The co. has been in
existence a good many years ; it has no reserve-fund, and
its entire accumulations are £428, which, as a margin for
possible losses, is hardly worth mentioning. Altogether,
the Tasmanian P.E. and T. Assn, seems a very humble
and unpretentious failure. *
St. James’ Building Society (Melbourne) re-
ports that the loss for the half-year is £6893 (£6709 being
depreciation and bad debts, and the rest general in-
ability to earn enough to meet expenses). Last year
showed a loss of £62,556, so things are decidedly bettdr.
The accumulated shortage is now exactly £79,178, or over
one-third of the capital, but as even Melbourne property
can’t go on depreciating for ever, because it can’t become
worth less than absolutely nothing, there are hopes that
the downfall is now near an end. The general writing-
down of banks, building and insurance societies, and
other institutions is all part of one big transaction. All
Australasia, on which statistician Coghlan put, in 1890, a
gorgeous valuation of £1,169,000,000, has got to be
written down, and what the real figure will be like when
it gets to bedrock no one can guess yet.
That big monopoly, the Colonial Sugar Refining
Co., made a profit for last half-year of £85,545 and pays a
10 per cent, dividend (£85,100), so it seems to be still
reasonably successful in dodging its share of the sugar
troubles. It has also a credit-balance of £88,746 from
previous prosperous years and £328,000 of reserves, so it
will probably get its humble crust pretty regularly what-
ever happens to the miserable N.S.W. sugar-'TOwer.

The reconstructed N.Z. Loan and Mercantile
Agency Co. is again reported (by cable) to be in grievous
straits. The institution reconstructed away back in ’94,
and wrote off some £640,000, and fixed up a fearful and
wonderful arrangement of its liabilities whereby the
prior lien 4 per cent: debenture-holders come first, and
the 5 percent. “A” debenture-creditors follow, and the
5 per cent. “B” debentures come third. Then the
ordinary creditors have a look-in here or thereabouts,
and after them come the preference shareholders, next the
first lot of ordinary shareholders, and last of all the
second batch of dreadfully ordinary shareholders, whose
prospects seem too remote to be worth mentioning. The
English courts made severe remarks about the Loan and
Mercantile on this occasion, and called some of its past
balance-sheets something so very like an Ananias that the
difference didn’t amount to much. After this there was
peace for a while ; then further trouble arose with the
auditors. These unfeeling persons reported that there
was a lot of depreciation unprovided for, and that the
writing-down which, it was professed, had put everything
on a bed-rock basis, wasn’t anythin# like large enough to
cover the losses, and that the new balance-sheet was
about as unreliable as the old one. In short, they wanted
to write off £847,000 more. The directors, however, rose
in revolt, and denied these awkward statements, and
declared that if the auditors’ report was adopted they
would resign unanimously. Whereupon the weak-kneed
shareholders decided to stand by the directors, who said
much pleasanter things than the auditors, and it was
agreed by everybody concerned that everything was
quite right.
The present cablegram states briefly that after
paying interest on the prior lien debentures and the “ A
debentures there is a shortage of £34,063. If these state-
ments are strictly accurate, then it would seem that there
isn’t enough to pav interest on the “ B debentures, let
alone paying a dividend on the preference shares and the
ordinary paid-up shares and the ordinary shares par-
tially paid up. Also it is announced that it is neces-
sary to make allowances for depreciation largely
beyond the amount indicated last year, which is
a solemn warning to those shareholders who in effect
threw out the auditors for what now seems to have
been the solid truth-presumably as a warning to
auditors in general that they are not to say unpleasant
things and make matters uncomfortable for the directors.
The situation of the N.Z.L. and M. is so unspeakably
tangled up that its prospects are difficult to estimate, but
in view of the information just received they seem suffi-
ciently bad. A co. which owes £2,370,000 at 4 per cent,
and £2,280,000 at 5 per cent, is staggering under a rather
considerable burden. What the losses amount to the
cable doesn’t state, but the acknowledgment that they
are “ large ” looks ominous.

Queensland, which already has the biggest debt
on earth (669 per head) in proportion to population, pro-
poses borrowing £2,342,000 more. Part is to be obtained
out of local trust funds, and it is proposed to borrow
£1,500,000 in London at 3i per cent. With the Q.N. Bank
revelations in full blast, the present is a rather smellful
time for the Q. Government to exploit the London
market. Further, seeing that N. S.W. and Vic. are both
raising local loans at 3 per cent., the money should be
easily obtained in Melbourne or Sydney—where flotation
expenses are much lower than in London —at 3J, unless
the Boodle party is utterly damned. Possibly, owing to
the beautiful Federal spirit, the Queensland Ministry is
afraid lest its loathsome contemporaries down South
should annex the profit of the transaction.

The Intercolonial Investment, Land and Build-
ing Co. (Sydney) announces that it has made a' profit of
£6085 for the year. It pays a 10 per cent dividend
(£3199), adds £1250 to reserve, making it £BO5O ; sets aside
£1250 as a reserve for equalisation of dividends, and the
remaining £386, with £1297 previously on hand, makes
the profit and loss balance £1683. The Intercolonial has
£43,000 of shareholders’ money and only £9OOO of deposits,
and its good luck seems to be owing to the fact that it
trades mainly with its own funds, and isn’t struggling
under a great load of deposit money taken at high
interest in the boom years. Almost every Sydney society
which went in for a huge business in deposits has long
since gone under or reconstructed.

The Bulletin knows the case of a N.S.W.

one house. When it is let it produces, after paying
local taxes and repairs, a net income of about

based on the alleged unimproved value of the ground on
which this house stands —is £lO Bs., 20 per cent of the

The recent failure, for the second time, of a
Smell bourne auctioneer directs further attention to the
scandalous law—or want of law —that enables a man to
sell other people’s property under the hammer without
incurring the obligations of an ordinary trustee. A client
confiding his furniture, or what not, to an auctioneer is
placed in the position of a trader who sells goods on credit.
The auctioneer, after disposing of the consignment “ on
commission,” is at liberty to pocket the cash, file his
schedule, and leave the consignee to get whatever infini-
tesimal dividend may be passed through the court by a
friendly three-fourths majority of the creditors. In short,
the almighty wind-bag perched behind “ the rostrum ” is
licensed to do as he pleases in his capacity of bailee,
and until the Law cares to give protection to his clients —
many of whom are guileless widows entrusting their little
all to the vociferous gentleman’s care—every auctioneer’s
office should be billed with an announcement to this
effect. Then the guileless widow would make prudent
enquiries ere dumping down her worldly possessions in a
place where she stands the risk of receiving not more
than one penny in the £ upon the amount of cash they
realise —for the auctioneer. If you hire a vanman to cart
your goods from one place to another and he carts them
to his own house you can gaol him for larceny as a bailee ;
but if you hire an auctioneer to sell your goods he can
embezzle all the proceeds and compound his felony with
a penny in the £, or even less ! If a lawyer embezzles
trust-funds his back can, in some measure, be bared to the
whips of justice ; but the auctioneer can simply spread his
fingers from his nose at his victim.

There is very little “ terror for evildoers ” left in
the Vic. Companies Bill now that it has been reconstructed
by Sargood’s select committee and doctored by the Leg.
Council. Nearly all the amendments proposed in com-
mittee and rushed through the delectable Upper House,
are sinful things. Many of them are impudently im-
moral. Take, for example, the amendment which strikes
out clause 24. The honesty of clause 24 was unimpeach-
able. It required all banks to make up and file a state-
ment of assets and liabilities as on one particular day in
each year. This was a simple device to prevent the
balancing trick from being worked upon a guileless
public. It was so desirable a clause that Sargood didn’t
venture to suggest Fat Man’s reason for striking it out,
and the Councillors “ amended” it off the face of the Bill
without offering any excuse.
Clause 26 was also calculated to give bank-
directors a pain under the pinny, therefore Sargood’s
committee pulverised it, and Sargood in person subse-
quently carried the harmless fragments through. The
Parliamentary report of Council proceedings at this stage
is very interesting : “ The clause was further amended by
striking out the words ‘ knowingly or with gross negli-
gence,’ with respect to a director concerned in publishing
certain false statements, and substituting the word ‘ wil-
fully.’” Danger of a successful criminal prosecution
lurked in the original words. Gross negligence is a
tangible offence. A false balance-sheet statement is, as a
rule, so obvious that the issuers couldn’t escape the
charge of “ knowingly ” telling lies. Hence the substitu-
tion of “wilfully,” which is a word for lawyers to juggle
with and for judges to have many doubts about.
Leg. Council emasculation of the Companies
Bill will be found, in all places, favorable to fraud. The
Bill returns to the Assembly stripped of its original good
intentions and moulded to the wishes of Sargood and his
trembling prot6g6s. Premier Turner has the choice of
three evils—to take the “ amended ” measure, or leave it,
or raise a general insurrection against the Council. And
seeing that the last evil is the only one from which real
good can come, Turner is pretty certain to treat this
attempt to maintain financial roguery as a constitutional
question. * * *
Govt, experts don’t damn the B.H. Water
Supply’s service out-and-out. (Did the new president
of N.S.W. Board of Health and Govt. Medical Adviser
ever damn anything outright?) Say the water, though
not fit for a town supply, may be improved by filtration,

Barass and Conley, of Cobar, N.S.W., cleaned
up a big crushing last week. The return has not been
disclosed —which doesn’t look as if the average had
gone up. A. T. Brown, the Billionaires’ expert, ex-
amined the mine three weeks ago, but his people seem
not to have gone in. Howell inspected this week—
though it is not a metallurgical proposition. It is more
than whispered that this mine was recently sampled
by a well-known man who proposed to invest heavily
if representations were borne out by his own sampling,
and the results were so disappointing that he not only
declined, but considered it right to advise at least one
man closely connected with it to be careful and have the
mine thoroughly sampled by an independent person.
Some gold is still coming out of the brown lode so-called.

One or two English co’s are doing big work in
N.S.W. without much newspaper fuss. As a rule, the co.
that sings loudest in newspapers has the poorest mine.
Now said that the Lyndhurst Co., working a property
near Mandurama, has spent about £20,000 in damming
back the Belubula River to secure water-power for a 60-
head mill. “It is expected that when everything is in
full swing 50 tons of stone will be put through daily.” A
60-head mill should crush three times that quantity. “ The
whole of the hill contains gold, and will he worked from
a face.” This sounds like the old Junction reefs : if so,
the co. will have to put out better ore than the tens of
thousands already crushed, or have a narrow squeak to
make the concern pay. There is plenty of gold in it, but
it is in too much dirt. High extraction by milling is next
to impossible.

tons, 2500 z. West Sunlight, 340 tons, 2920 z.—a substan-
tial! improvement, but how long are the shareholders to
wait for divs. ? Pioneer, near Wyalong, 42 tons, 1470 z.
N.S. Wales, Wyalong, 35 tons, 3360 z.—a splendid average,
but, coming from boomless Wyalong, nobody is concerned
about it.

Hitherto the system of “paddocking” or pig-
rooting has been followed at White Cliffs opal field. The
new English co. which recently took over most of the
leading blocks is going in for more systematic mining,
including deeper-level exploration. So far, at the new
Purnanga opal rush, on Momba run, no payable gems
have been found—few so far, indeed, that are even
saleable.

When the Sulphide Corporation (Ashcroft’s pro-
cess) took over the Central mine, a completely new
machinery outfit was decided upon, to cost £47,000. New
hauling engines have been laid down, an ore-dressing
mill erected, and the completed improvements will be in
order by the end of the year. The mill, though specially
designed to meet the requirements of the main process to
be operated at the same co.’s Cockle Creek works (New-
castle, N.S.W.), follows pretty closely upon the lines of
the May jigs. A portion of this milling plant is now at
work. Hitherto since the co. took over the mine only
enough ore has been broken to pay expenses ; in the past
six months a total of 30,000 tons has been extracted;
nearly'the whole of it was taken by Block 14. The output
in the next six months will probably go up to ten times
that quantity ; but unfortunately most of the profits will
go abroad. The Central was always a mine of surprises;
since this co. took it over art apparently distinct and
promising body was passed through in a ne»' hauling
shaft.
The Tarrawingee Co. pays a div. But its days
are numbered. Junction North comes out with a regular
monthly sixpenny ; and the Junction, after manipulating
dates so as to pay a monthly div. every six weeks or so,
finds it possible to get nearer the even dates. The South
is shipping a thumping parcel of over 2000 tons concen-
trates', making a clean-up of the over-crowded floors.
The 800 ft. explorations in this mine are still unsatis-
factory : the property’s misfortune is the hardness of the
ore in the upper levels. The British mill continues to
work with conspicuous evenness, and the mine under-
ground opens satisfactorily in milling ore—the stuff out
of which small divs are made with careful management;
very small divs., in fact, on this co’s capital. The B.H.
Proprietary has some of its new milling plant ready, and
with the production of concentrates will be able to reduce
the extraction and export of oxidised ores—a very desir-
able change.
At long last Block 10’s new milling plant has
been got into full work, and ought on earlier runs to deal
with the promised 2000 tons of ore weekly. (The Cen-
tral’s capacity is 2500 tons, by the way ; that of the
British works nearly 3000.) The ore averages about 19oz.
silver, 19 per cent, lead, and 30 per cent. zinc. On such
ore the mill produced 426 tons concentrates, going 33|oz.
silver, 64'3 per cent, lead, and 9'9 per cent, zinc, from 1875
tons ore. The loss of silver is still very heavy, and of lead
moderate ; but it does not seem to be possible for concen-
trating by any known method to fully overcome that pro-
fitably, on account of the unusually high percentage of
zinc and its most intimate association with the silver.
What can be done is to extend the present system of re-
treating the slimes that are heaviest in zinc (and there-
fore heaviest also in silver) and the old plant will pro-
bably be adapted for this work. Some engineers doubt
whether the machinery is capable of standing the severe
strain to which it must be put.
In all the Purnamoota district, where once, in
one day, 200 claims were applied for, and from whose
Lubra, Black Prince and others Sydney people were once
going to make fortunes, there is but one little “show”
working—the Black Prince—and there only half-a-dozen
men are engaged.
An early flotation, or attempt thereat, will be
the Rise and Shine, with a fair sulphide body : only good
enough for a small, very carefully-managed co. or co-ope-
rative party, notwithstanding that it stands head and
shoulders above most “ outside shows.” Considering the
struggle of such sulphide mines as the South, with ten
time's the ore in sight, and a railway to the shaft’s mouth,
a hopeless project is the Melb. Rookwell—but the writer
doesn’t know what name it will be launched with.

The Bulletin has just got, from Kalgoorlie, a
wire stating that a mine, belonging to Bull, having one of
the best plants on the field, and situated not far from the

value. White quartz and sand are both plentiful in
Westralia, which will be a very great country when either
commodity becomes dear. Two long, weary years, and
without a crushing.

Great Boulder, 704 tons, 212G0z. Main shaft
down 300 feet, and a start about being made to crosscut
for the lode. The result will be watched with as much
anxiety as interest. The sudden awful change which
took place in the Brown Hill lode, and the general ten-
dency Westralian reefs have to change for the worse
with a change of country, has not popularised deep sink-
ing. The Boulder has tackled 300 feet, anyway, and the
shaft should have given some idea of the formation. It
is beyond doubt a great mine above the 300 ft., and if it
proves as great below it, other shafts will be rushed down
and not a question will be asked why they waited so long
to go down.

The Gen. Gordon crushing when it comes —
about five weeks from now, probably—will have to be a
big one, as regards the quantity of material treated, if it
is to have more than a momentary effect upon the
market. The time for working a boom with a small crush
has passed. Meanwhile a statement which comes to
Tiik Bulletin from an ordinarily very reliable quarter as
plain, unvarnished truth about the G.G. stuff should
help to explain many things. There are 70 or 80 tons on
hand equal to producing sozs. to the ton, or thereabouts,
and several hundred other tons from which the Archangel
Gabriel wouldn’t squeeze more than five pennyweights.
As for the bulk of the Gordon “formation” it may, says
this authority, be estimated at, say, two pennyweights of
precious metal to over 2240 pounds (otherwise a ton) of
blessed formation. The Gordon formation is described as
a melancholy satire upon the expensive crushing plant
dedicated to its service, and Adelaide shareholders will
have something to say about that plant shortly.

There is a lot of the gambling element in even
so prosaic an occupation as bore-sinking. The other day
on a N.Q. station a certain firm abandoned a certain bore

And isn’t that first firm cursing itself?

Cape York Peninsula is estimated to have lost
two-thirds of its stock by the tick-plague. Gamboola, on

Wrotham Park, from 25,000 to 9000. In N.W. Q’sland,
however, there are many' places absolutely untouched,
while in coast districts the young ticks are so numerous
as to transmogrify white pants into a strange, brick-

Victoria tops the Australian mining output;
Queensland comes second. But in proportion to men
employed Queensland heads the list. Victoria’s last
annual output was 740,0000 z. for 30,000 miners, or 240 z,
per man, while Bananaland gave 631,0000 z. for 10,000, or
630 z. per man. For big-yielding mines Queensland takes
the cake. Mount Morgan has produced £4.000,000 worth
of gold, and the Brilliant line of reef (Towers) about
£1,700,000.

The opal industry is waxing apace in Queens-
land. In 1894 value of opal turned out was £12,000, but
last year the figures rose to £32,750 with every appear-
ance of the advance being continued. Since 1890 gems
to the value of £67,750 have been Obtained. Fermoy and
Thargomindah are the two chief centres. The sapphire
output is at present practicaliy nil. By the way, there is
a strong and stealthy movement on the part of a big
syndicate to acquire the whole of the Australian opal-
mines. At present the working opal-miner is “had” for
probably at least 70 per cent, of the value of his finds ;
good opals realise abroad prices that are simply enor-
mous. The gems are growing in fashion locally ; but on
the Continent of Europe and in America people simply
rave about them.

Says a very awful Sydney mining authority :
“Regarding the prospects of the West it may betaken
for granted that when the machinery now being so
lavishly erected is really at work adequate results will
follow. Of course there are some duffers amongst so
great a crowd of claims —it would be absurd to suppose
otherwise, but there are plenty of good mines, quite
enough, indeed, to prove that the great stretch of country
from the Dundas ranges to the Northern Murchison is
one of the richest golden zones in the world.” But where
are the batteries erected two years ago? Mostly idle.
Those erected last year? Idle. Most of those erected
this year? Idle. A few fine mines have been found in
the West, and more will be found, but in few parts of the
whole world could so much money have been spent in
mining with a worse general result than that so far
obtained in Westralia.

There is little fresh in Adelaide Hospi-
tal matters. The rival doctors are still busily
engaged in carving the citizens and settling doubts
by post-mortem. Hardly a day passes without
some sawbones accusing a hated rival of man-
slaughter, but as the usual outcome is the showing
up of the accusing party in his turn, matters
remain as they are. Premier Kingston, at a
fashionable dinner a few weeks ago, was intro-
duced to the charming daughter of one of the
striking hospital doctors. After making most of
tlie conversation for about a quarter of an hour,
C.O.K. was flabbergasted at the remark: “Do
you know, I often wish that you were dead !
SHE WAS SORRY SHE SPOKE.
“ It's too hot to play tennis in that collar, Charley; do lake it off.” (Charley does so, but Maud feels too ill to play).
The last despairing fight of the political oppon-
ents of Adelaide Hospital management will be
made when the vote for the payment of the new
doctors comes up in the Assembly this month,
The Govt, has purposely pushed back the esti-
mates till the last moment because it knows that'
these particular items will be stonewalled. Pro-
rogation is fixed for Friday, Dec. 18.

Adelaide “Society” feels deeply incensed
with Dr. Leith Napier in that he evidently
cares little for its boycott, but its most
special wrath is earned because he will not bring
out his wife for the high-class Adelaide dames to
vent their spleen upon. The “common people,”
despite industriously circulated slanders, are still
on the side of the Ministry and the new doctors.
* * * *
Extract from evidence of Dr. Corbin, the
ex-hospital junior surgeon who is Dr. Napier’s
chief accuser:—
Did you not think that you should interfere in the
interests of humanity that you talked about the other
night?—l thought the greatest good to the greatest
number was far more to be considered, and I did not
interfere because I hoped he would kill the man on the
table and so damn himself for ever. (Hisses and applause
from the audience.) I thought if one case could raise the
indignation of this sluggish public that perhaps many
lives would be saved.
You don’t mean that if this man died then Dr. Napier’s
reputation was damned?—Yes, if I could save the lives of
many patients.
Dr. Corbin is a very young med. who had been
doing surgical work in the hospital for under six
months, but considered himself qualified to criti-
cise the veteran Dr. Napier. Dr. Corbin occupies
a position of much delicacy in the matter, be being
a son of an Adelaide surgeon who was one of the
original hospital-board which started the trouble
and the members of which were practically dis-
missed by Govt.

Adelaide Hospital disputes have so far
produced a Royal Commission enquiry, several
Board enquiries, and a Select Committee (now
enquiring) ; also a petition is being hawked
around by Tory women for another Royal Com-
mission to be presided over by a Supreme Court
Judge or Commissioner Russell. But the Hos-
pital trouble has now come down to be a mere
political row, with the Ass crowd very much
underneath.

N.S.W. Full Court, in divorce, the other
day, gave practically this ruling on human nature :
Given a man, given a woman, and given oppor-
tunity, the law assumes adultery. Which seems
to be an unwarrantable presumption, and certainly
places a low estimate on human nature. It is just
this sort of reading of the law that gives a black-
mailing She who pairs with a lonely male in a
railway carriage the leverage she requires. The
risk to the man is worth any money to avoid,
**‘ * *
Odd that a man should forget a divorce-
case in which he has been co-respondent. There
was such a gentleman in the Melbourne court on
Monday week. When asked to mention the
first divorce-case in which he appeared, he said
he had quite forgotten. How hard on the lady to
know that her charms have been so soon forgotten !
And no doubt he promised to love her eternally—
they always do. Labouchere tells a story of the
late Lord Dupplin which is on all fours. He met
the peer in the neighborhood of the Law Courts,
looking very sad and gloomy. “ Why, what’s the
matter, Duppy? ” said he. “Well, I’m in
trouble. What s wrong ?” “I have been
served with papers naming me as co-respondent
J n a divorce-suit.” “Well, are you guilty?”
“Ah, that is the trouble—l really cannot recol-
lect.” If we only were as sure of having our sins
forgiven as we are of forgetting them !

By 27 votes to 26, including pairs, S.A.
Assembly declined to compel shopkeepers in the
metropolitan area to give one half-holiday a week
m lieu of closing early on Saturday evening.
DISTANTLY BELATED.
“ Did you say he was a connection of yours?”
“Only by marriage—he was co-respondent in my divorce-case.”
In an other-day divorce-suit—husband v-
wife and another—the wife did not deny the
adultery, but ingeniously pleaded in defence that
she was insane at the time of her sin, and
therefore not responsible for her actions. But a
hard-hearted bench winked the other eye, and sen-
tentiously verdicted—“ rule nisi.”
Noticing that in certain
legal documents and plead-
ings which came before N.S.
Wales Supreme Court lately,
the widow of Sir William
Macleay was referred to
throughout as “Dame” Mac-
leay, a coterie A untitled
pragmatists has set itself to
popularise such addresses as
Dame Martin, Dame Parkes,
and so on. The coterie argues
that as it is irregular to use
the courtesy title of “ Lady ”
in the Supreme Court it should
be irregular to use it any-
where.

A Sydney man “in the
horrors,” t’other day, was
bailing-up every fishing-tackle
shop (until run home by his
friends), with the pitiful story
that he had three live cray-
fish inside his chest, and
would his friends, for the
love of Heaven, drop a well-
baited hook and line down
his throat and haul the brutes
up? . . . But the writer knew
a Queenslander, years ago,
who lay down and swore he
was a railway - track from
Brisbane to Ipswich, with a
series of 1 aded trains run-
ning at intervals through his
in’ards. He’d blow the whistle,
bid you “ take your seats,”
start the most infernal rumb-
ling, stop at the various sta-
tions, yell out their names,
with, at last “ Terminus ! ”
After which he’d lie still till
the delirium took him once
more, yell out again and go
through the whole panto-
mime, until he was “got off” by chloral hydra te.

The tender heart of woman asserts itself
in all manner of unexpected places. A year ago
a Melbourne lady obtained a divorce from her
faithless husband, who promptly fled to Sydney to
avoid payment of the alimony. He remained
there for over 12 months, leaving his wife to
struggle with this hard world “on her own but at
last the great Australian horse-mania became too
strong for him, and, despite the writs that were
out for him and the police who were yearning to
run him in, he went stealthily over to see the Cup.
He didn’t see it; the hungry “ cop ” collected him
the day before the event. Then, when he was
fairly in gaol, his former wife relented and im-
plored the Judge to let him out, but a cold, unfeel-
ing voice from under the horse-hair wig declined
to entertain the proposal. Whereupon she can-
celled the debt in the only possible way by marry-
ing the faithless male a second time, and so he has
a prospect of seeing next Melbourne Cup in peace,
unless there is another divorce before then.

Some recent mysterious disappearances re-
call a case which occurred shortly after the collapse
of Melb. land-boom. A well-known society man
suddenly and mysteriously vanished. All the
usual hue and cry devices were unavailingly re-
sorted to. At last—some nine months later—
when a prominent dealer in real estate was in-
specting a dilapidated terrace of houses in Bruns-
wick, the Lost One astonished the visitor by open-
ing the door, clad merely in an old shirt and
pants. He was the caretaker. Ruin had over-
taken him, so he led the life of a hermit in prefer-
ence to committing open suicide.

A big commercial man got home the other
day after a fortnight’s absence and found as sugar
for his breakfast coffee an epistle to this effect: —
Dear Sir, —I was at ’s hotel last Wednesday at 3 a.m.
when you came out of that bedroom. Forward £lOO to-
day by registered letter to meat G.P.0., or I will write
and tell your wife, with all due corroborative detail.—
Yours truly, .
The big commercial man posted a registered letter
and lay in wait all day at the G.P.O. Sure
enough, the blackmailer came, and was imme-
diately pounced upon, dragged to a police-station,
and with the assistance of a friendly detective,
frightened out of seven years’ growth, and —let go.
But why was he let go ?
Blackmail at N.B.W. hotels has been quite
common (and successful) of late.

Old Government House at Parramatta is
now a sauce-manufactory.
The most flourishing domestic industry in
Australia at the present time is—wife-desertion.
Wonder what percentage of collusion it would pan
out, if it could be exactly scrutinised ? When a
husband bolts from a wife, she nearly always runs
at him with a divorce-writ. When a wife deserts
a husband, does he hunt her into the Divorce
Court? Not much. Not often. Reason? Hubby
is always potted for the ex.’s. Yet this is the Age
of Bloomers.

The sad case at Orange (N.S.W.), where a
mother, aged 13| years, died after giving birth to
twins, is, after all, a sounding slap in the face of
the Age-of-Consent Party. The medical evidence
went to show that, had not the girl-mother been
suffering from broncho-pneumonia, she would
have lived. One child was born alive and is still
living ; the other was stillborn. Any mother of
any age might die under such circumstances. The
real point is—if Australian girls so soon reach
puberty as to be able to become mothers at
years, what becomes of the shriek for raising the
“ age of consent ” to 18 ?

“Trafalgar Centennial” happened to be
the first fine day for six weeks, writes ‘ Min-
yarrah ’ from London to The Bulletin, and
suburban London turned out in thousands to see
160 ft. of bluestone, with a squat caricature on top,
twined with seven tons of goat-feed. Around the
column’s base a dozen trumpery floral construc-
tions shivered and shrunk in the bleak wind like
prematurely-born, unfledged scarecrows. Appre-
hensive of the tender, touchy condition of
European politics, the Government frowned on
the celebration and refused a naval guard or band,
but the smoke-swallowing ancient admirals and
‘ nob’-nobbling provincial mayors, who run the
‘Navy League,’ backed up by the money and
influence of the almost-idle naval construction
yards, meant to have a cheap advt., and, perhaps,
they got it. All day and late into the night the
people surged round Landseer’s lions. The
‘ nation’s pulse ’ —the music-halls —beat beerily
patriotic, the papers lowered their butter-wrapping
value by printing libellous splotches of the dust-
decayed Cyclops, and those who had nothing to
do took a holiday as an excuse and had their
pockets picked.”

The Bulletin cordially approves of the
scheme to send the Sydney city surveyor to
Europe to inquire as to the best means of dis-
posing of garbage. When he comes back he may
know how to deal with certain of the aldermen.
One night recently an Austra-
lian Governor and his suite unex-
pectedly found their true level.
They had gone to the theatre, and
at the first interval His Ex. and the
A.D.C. went out to see a man about a
dog. Just as they lined up at the d.c.
bar a pained expression came into the
Gov.’s face and he felt in all his
pockets. The result was 3d. TheA.D.C.
felt in all his pockets, and panned out
for nothing at all. The bar Flossie
didn’t know either of them
from a crow, and looked on
absolutely unsympathetic;
the idea of assuring them
that the shilling really
didn’t matter never once
occurred to her. Then
H.E. took a threepenny
packet of cigarettes, and
he and his attendant
went sadly away dry.
Just as they got to their
seats someone informed
the manager that a
Governor was
#
vainly trying to get a drink, and he came upstairs
four steps at a jump to “shout.” But when he
arrived the curtain had gone up, and the viceroy
was in his box again, so the great man was left to
parch.

Gov. Lamington selects his Government

with the ignorant selector J.P. who will pervert it the
other way, so that the two perversions will balance each
other. But the gratis amateur law-maker will be a curse
all the same H.H.G. : Thanks Fact: The “ terrible
infant ” in English yarns is only an ill-timed babe who
gives away the fact that the table-cloth is an old sheet.
In Australian tales he is obscene and decorated with to-
bacco-juice, and says “ blanky.” Miner (Mudgee): Only
amounts to the fact that the horse was fed on pumpkins.
B. something or other (or else J. Whatisname) : Letter
reads like “Hoop gloom as to stagger ant umbrella

you sign yourself “ Juuuuu Juuuuuuu,” and give your
address as “ Uuuuuuuuuu,” and add a P.S. like “ Conger
eel insolvent flap 92 jump.” No wonder we are all grey
where we aren’t bald Queenslander : (1) A £30,000 pro-
perty is generally valued for probate at £19,000 or less,
just as it is valued for State resumption purposes at
£137,000. (2) If properties are mortgaged, gross value of
.properties is generally reckoned among assets ; mortgages
among liabilities. (3) Don’t know how to get particu-
lars ; probably a solicitor could tell you how to obtain

Mr. William Thomas Smith or Mr. Ebenezer Stiggins
H.S.S.P. : Agree with your sentiments, but nothing new
in article E.G.B. (Hannan’s) : Not much interested in
skull developments of U.S. Presidential elections. Our
own skull-development takes up all our time L.R.M. :

about the aged theme of two young people on one chair.

the “Godless system of education”—calculated to make
the children think no more of a parson than of any other
tradesman W.H. (Melb.) : Your “facts” are a string
of hearsay libels. The story is only true inasmuch as the
lady was more or less “cheeked” by a shopman who didn’t
happen to know her. She complained and his excuse to
the boss was that he didn’t make himself more civil
because he thought she was only an ordinary customer.
He wasn’t instantly dismissed, or threatened with dismis-
sal, but merely pegged back for not being civil to all cus-
tomers, ordinary or otherwise. Subsequently he resigned
on account of having been pegged back. After which he
sent an abusive letter to Govt. House Hermes : Con-
sidering “Dunbar.” D.M.R. : Possibly R.E.D. : (1)
Verse flat; (2) prose nice par-point only ; (3) can’t advise.
D.M. : The Jabberwoek lives in Lewis Carroll’s
“Through the Looking-glass”—any bookseller E.M. :
“Especial fear” has good idea and plot; but too many
inequalities in treatment. E.g., “The little bank-clerk
wrested the knife from the maniac ” slides over a diffi-
culty. How do little bank-clerks wrest knives from

Mr. G. L. Goodman, the theatrical busi-
ness manager and treasurer, is as well-known as
any actor. He has stood in front of one Sydney
theatre or another almost every night during the
past 17 years, and for eight years before this he
used to appear as an amateur player in charity
benefits. An outline of his managerial engage-
ments speaks his capacity and disposition. First
he managed for Garner, then for Garner and
Williamson, then for Williamson, Garner and
Musgrove, then for Musgrove, then for William-
son and Garner, then for Williamson and Mus-
grove ; now he returns, at the Sydney Palace of
Varieties, to Mr. Garner, his original employer.
And Williamson and Musgrove recently wired
him: “We desire you accept complimentary
matinee before leaving our employ as a small
token of our appreciation of your long and faith-
ful services.” That benefit happens to-day
(Thursday, 3rd Dec.), at Sydney Lyceum, and
will be contributed to by a vast array of
talent. Goody says: “ Players, as a sec-
tion of the community, are the most generous
and the most traduced. The churches rail at
them on Sunday, and on Monday request and
obtain their free services for a charity f§te. If an
actor runs away with a woman, or stumbles into
the divorce-court, ‘ it’s a wretch of an actor who’s
done it.’ ” But other men blunder just as sheepish-
ly. “Can the stage,” remarks Mr. Goodman,
“be said always to have a wayward tendency
when Harry Conor, who is essentially a low
comedian, writes a mass which is sung
each Sunday in a certain Sydney church ?
As an instance of how theatrical people will take
press criticism : A certain comedy actor years
ago used to be very roughly handled by the press.
Said he : ‘ I don’t care a damn.’ After a while he
made a big hit, and the papers gave him glowing
notices. I met him with a bundle of them under
his arm. Asked what he was going to do with
them, he replied, ‘ Send them home to let them
know how lam getting on.’ We have put a piece
on at a cost of hundreds— ‘ Magnificent,’ some
paper will remark. Later a cheap piece is staged.
‘ Magnificent,’ remarks the paper again. Super-
stition in the profession has much decreased within
my memory. There was a strong superstition
about ‘ Macbeth ’; nobody liked to hear ‘ Mac-
beth ’ music, or a ‘ Macbeth ’ quotation The
reason was, I believe, that several theatres,
while performing that play, were burnt down.
The character of Deacon Skinner, in ‘Struck
Oil,’ was another bogey—so many who imper-
sonated it died. When Dacre murdered
himself and wife two or three refused his
part. Many of our people wear rings, orna-
ments, &c. ‘for luck.’ The rosy time of Sydney
theatres was from ’BO to ’9l. In ’BO there were
only four in Sydney, including the School of Arts ;
of late years the number has increased out of all
proportion to theatre-goers. And a theatre needs
support: some of the Firm’s pantomimes have
cost, for scenery and wardrobes, .£2500 or £3OOO,
while salaries and working exes, per week have
totalled £BOO or £9OO. It is not easy to gauge the
£ublic taste. But I feel sure that in Sydney, as in
iondon, we are developing a fondness for variety
shows. People won’t come nowadays to sit out a
play and to follow the intricacies of a plot or the
thread of a story. They want to come in when
they please, listen when they please, leave when
they please. And the variety show fills this
sort of bill.”
Time deals gently with the woman who
uses “Babeskin” soap. It softly removes the
tell-tale lines of the years, and renews the delicate
bloom of youth. One shilling packages of two
cakes. All chemists.*

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Dec. 1, 1896.
Mr Dear Myeb—
A society called the “ National Council of
Women of N.S.W.” lately held its half-yearly
meeting in Sydney Town Hall. _ The National
Council is an amorphous body which meets twice
a year and boldly charges up blind alleys, of
debate, and wanders about in mazes of discussion.
The only thing at all clear at last meeting was
that a lady who held the floor for most of the
time was bent on appointing herself delegate to
the head-council to which the local body is hooked
on—the head council aforesaid being presidented
by a countess and located in England. The
Council’s main object, according to the high-flown
constitution, seems to be “ to spread God’s bless-
ing around and enforce the Golden Rule,” but any
other little endeavor on the part of any twopenny-
halfpenny Dorcas society or Suburban Mutual
Improvement club will be considered at head-
quarters of “national character,” “national value,”
provided the committee are ready with the annual
half-sov. Why the delegate goes ’Ome is not
quite clear, unless to show the Britishers the type
of “God’s blessing” which we can raise locally,
and to apply the Golden Rule personally to the
British aristocracy.
“Guilds” and “clubs” and “coteries” are a
craze with women just now. If a girl has a sudden
virtuous resolve that she really won’t gossip any
more about that “ odious cat,” her bosom friend,
she immediately floats herself as a moral limited
liability co., before the glow has cooled, and
gathers others unto herself who vow to think no
evil (under vice-regal patronage). If she prefers
gingerbeer to champagne, she forthwith advertises
the fact by sticking a bit of blue ribbon on her
chest, and if she wants to be thoroughly objection-
able and get herself hated all round she joins the
W.C.T.U. and flaunts her inward purity in the
face of man by wearing a white rosette. The
latest fad is to sew flannel weskits and moral
pocket-handkerchiefs in a “ guild ” headed by an
H.R.H., called the “London Needlework Guild.”
The garments are given to the poor, who some day
will become tired of wearing a world’s misfits and
will organise a revolution compelling the donors
to clothe themselves in their own mistakes. An
underlined rule in the prospectus (guilds always
have a prospectus) sternly forbids the sending of
old clothes. Experience has taught that the
gushingly-advertised ‘ ‘ thanks for parcel of clothes ”
to charitable institutions have been often uttered
over a bundle of old belltoppers, old gloves, and
old ball-dresses
Some members of the Govt. House suite in a
neighboring province are emphasising the fact
that they are very much alive in so marked a
manner that the Head of affairs is getting quite
worried, and longs for the vanished days when the
most correct of secretaries was there to say
“ Don’t ”to every undignified frisker. A young
matron attached to the house-party is so tired of
being proper under the gubernatorial eye of Pa,
that she is planning a retreat into an establish-
ment of her own. The recent goings-on of a
youth attached to the same staff have horrified
the Nicest maids and matrons of the city, who at
the last ball of the season turned their backs and
sniffed disparagingly when he asked them to
dance—except two young married women who had
not been let into the plot to send him to Coventry
and were his sole partners for the evening.
The Mayor of an important Australian capital
gave a ball, and, as host, had to convey the Gov.’s
wife to supper. He could talk about as brilliantly
as a bunyip, and Her Ex. was haughty and remote
and had aristocratic shivers at his accent. At last
she remarked desperately that the passage was
draughty. “ Well, m’ lady,” his Worship replied,
bluntly, “ I don’t wonder you feel the cold when
you wear your dress so low.” Then the mournful
little procesh passed on in silence. But next year,
when the record-reign honors are distributed, it
will be that Mayor who will be out in the cold.
Bloomers are still enough of a novelty to be cer-
tain to draw a Sydney crowd. The other day, a
vvheelwoman clad in the divided garments alighted
at the door of a King-street draper’s, to the deep
interest of an ever-increasing crowd, who watched
the bike with enthralled gaze until its rider should
re-appear. She escaped a mobbing by sending a
shopman out for her bicycle and departing per
back door;
Poor little Same Macdonald’s totally unexpected
death was a great blow to all the Chinatown co.
She became violently ill after eating a hearty
supper, and the straining caused her to burst a
blood-vessel on the brain. Her funeral was fol-
lowed by all her professional friends and many
private ones, and heaps of exquisite flowers were
sent in token of good-bye, and carried with her to
h,er grave in Waverley. She had ricked her back
in Melbourne, and had for some time been out of
form; but there appears to have been no reason,
apart frpm that hearty supper of crayfish and
iced beer, why she should not have lived for years.
“ Henry V.,” at the Royal, began on Saturday
evening with as much fine linen and purple and
ermined mantle as of yore. In the wedding scene
there is still the same appearance of tossing in a
blanket about the Queen of France’s velvet train ;
the king, with long,, lank, black locks and beard,
is in a glorified table-cover of crimson
with fur trimmings. With Princess Katharine
comes on Miss Phillips as maid-in-waiting in
a long, historically - correct looking dress of
yellow satin, looped; up, with a heavy chain to
show a brown satin underskirt; a towering sugar-
loaf hat barred like a wasp, and a long white veil,
G. Rex himself looks his most regal in his wedding
tunic, with, brighf red. legs and the limelight full
on. On Monday night the d.c. was dotted with
several of the'resting “Chinatown” folk, and
filled with the same old indecision as to whether
it is going to take its hat off or not and pretend
that its black morning-coat is really a swallow-tail.
An excited audience simmered with expectation
over the jokes of “A Milk White Flag ” at Her
Majesty’s on Saturday evening. The d.c. was
crowded, and the gallery clamorous, and all gazed
sympathetically at the band gathered around the
stage-bar. But nothing very hilarious happened,
the guffaws at the first-act humor weakened into
titters at the second, and faded into grins at the
third, and at the end everybody looked solemnly
round for cloaks, and seemed to have missed
something. There is too much fat man in the
piece. The officers’ uniforms are too full of plump
officers, and the wearers are puffy, and a fat man
gambolling is a sorrowful sight. The dresses are
bright, and have the trail of Barnes over them all.
His heaven must be peopled by houris in short
skirts, flirting out at the tails perkily, and spangled
stockings. Sadie M‘Donald wore, perhaps, the
prettiest frocks, and in her vivandiere helmet
looked like Britannia on a penny.
A private view of the MacMahon Cinematograph
was given, on Friday morning, to a Guvmentouse
party, including Lady Hampden, and a chosen
twelve, who seemed to fancy the serpentine dance
more than anything else. The cin. shows Loie
Fuller gyrating in wonderfully realistic colors, and
the brilliant tints reveal the origin of the present
craze for gaudily-hued hats and frocks in the
multi-colored limelight thrown on La Loie’s skirts
when first she whirled them at the Parisians.
Although some of the other pictures are streaky,
and the lightning flashes are frequent, with Loie
Fuller the MacMahon cin. holds the Sydney
record.
A German institution, with a many-syllabled
name ending in “ verein,” benefited by an ama-
teur entertainment on Wednesday evening in the
old Gaiety Theatre, before the local 41ite from the
fatherland. “An Old Debt ” was struggled with
by the Garrick Society successfully, except that
the leading lady wreathed herself with long fan-
tastic garlands, & la Ophelia, and melodrammed
her part over-much ; but the girls were better
than the men, and Mary Waters, only for nervous-
ness, was acted with a trustful clingsomeness that
was most fetching.
The Mayoress of Sydney held her last reception
for the season on Wednesday last week. Mrs.
Ives received some hundreds of callers, who spent
the time chiefly in playing hide-and-seek with the
refreshment-tray in and out of the various rooms.
By a carefully-planned move, hungry guests were
able to intercept a waiter in each apartment and
make quite a hearty meal. Afternoon-tea grab-
bing has become a perfect scandal. At a musical
afternoon last week, I saw an indignant parlor-
maid remove a plate of pastry from its perch near
a woman who was wolfing rapidly behind the
lid of the grand piano. “I’ve stopped her this
time,” the maid murmured to her assistant. “ She
eats a whole plateful of tarts every blessed Tuesday
she comes here.” At Mrs. Ives’ reception the
waiters were kept busy. The hostess herself stood
aloof from her guests, in a plum-colored silk with
a white ham-frill round her neck. Most of the
dressing was dowdy. Some women wore white
muslin over pink, blue, or green, and looked like
draped toilet-tables.
On Thursday afternoon, in the Town Hall,
Lady Hampden distributed prizes given to
public-school children by the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals Society. The prize-takers ad-
vanced to the platform, and received their books
from Lady H., the Minister of Instruction picking
out the cleanest-looking heads and benevolently
patting them the while. Most of them were not
clean-looking, and some children hadn’t shoes and
stockings. The day was warm and the crowd
round the platform great, but Her Ex. bravely
held out until the last book was given.
The widow of Sir Samuel Wilson has just come
into .£3OOO a year from her father, Mr. Campbell,
formerly of Melb. She is a handsome, clever
woman, an ideal duchess in appearance, and was
the social prop of her plebeian-looking husband —
Salmon of the flame-colored whiskers.
A lady, a recently-returned Melb. Cup visitor
and an authority on cycling and cycling dress,
declares that Sydney holds the record for having
produced a neat and cheap skirt for wheel women.
When in Marvellous Melb. she interviewed all the
shops which make a feature of wheeling costumes,
and was amazed to find that in that city there are
still to be found women with money enough to add
to their accounts 10 or 12 guineas for a correctly-
cut cloth habit. They don’t hurry about paying,
of course. Five guineas will buy here an in-
geniously-constructed patent skirt with knicker
attachments, also a smart little coat. But when
you add to that the cost of the machine and
nursing and doctor’s expenses, cycling, after all,
■costs money.
It looks as if the nursing boom will shortly col-
lapse. The papers are giving the game away now
right and left, and boldly announce the revolt
against the scientific variety of nurse who rules
the whole house from the moment her white-cuffed
hand touches the door-bell. Many girls, who rush
to the hospitals in search of a career, chase that
phantom from bedside to bedside for two or three
years, and then either give up in disgust or com-
promise by marrying an eligible patient. But
trust a sufferer to find out the difference between
a nurse who is truly sympathetic and one who is
setting her cap at the doctor. Matrons and
medicos have various ways of staving-off unpro-
mising probationers, just as theatrical managers
frighten a stage-struck society-applicant by giving
her a part with tights in it for a start. A girl
fired with a desire to aid her suffering fellow-
mortals, told me that her ambition died a sudden
death when the first order given her in the hospital
was to wash a fractured Chinaman, just carried
into the casualty ward.
I have heard many touching tales from nurses of
how their patients have loved them and gently
passed into the silent land holding their hands and
breathing grateful words from their dying lips, or
else recovered and bombarded them with valuable
presents and marriage-offers. But I notice that
the loving patient is alicays a man. At a fashion-
able seaside resort I once met a nurse in charge of
a consumptive on a round-the-world tour in search
of a climate. She was quite sympathetic and
rather pretty; he was a particularly lively invalid.
And they seemed to be having a thoroughly
good time. Much depends on the patient. A
girl might devotedly rush off on a hundred-miles
coach-journey to smooth an attractive sufferer’s
pillow, but mightn’t be so ready to act ministering-
angel to her old mother down with rheumatics, or
to flat-iron her old dad’s back for lumbago.
By the way, I read that of trained nurses, 63
per cent, die of tuberculosis —a very effective proof
of its contagiousness. Eurther, the “ expectation
of life ” of a trained nurse, 17 years old, is only
years, whereas the ordinary expectation for
the average girl at that age is a shade over 41
years. The expectation in a 20-year-old nurse is
almost identical with that of a 52-year-old washer-
woman.
The latest craze is “ metaphysics ” combined by
the initiated with a kind of faith-healing. They study
the subjects under separate headings, and “ com-
bine the information ” like Mr. Potts’s young man
—a classic authority on metaphysics. Sydney
women are tying their brains into knots over the
ego and the non ego, and one enthusiast is going to
burst forth soon as a lecturess on transcendental
idealism of the Platonic or Berkleyan school. I
am giving you this as a piece of current gossip,
but what it all means I haven’t the very remotest
idea. As far as I can gather, the healer must be
a long way off from the would-be-healed—the
farther the better. Then he sends a telegram
giving his instructions, and the patient is cured by
(collect) wire.
A show of Xmas millinery has been opened up
at Horderns’ in Pitt-street. Hats this summer
are very self-assertive; they positively scream at
you, and the colors are sll decided on by an ex-
pert with a pink-and-white ideal of beauty. The
dolly woman with blue eyes and straw-colored
hair is easily suited with green poppies and fluffy
white ostrich-tips ; but it needs a careful blending
of the limelighty tints now fashionable on the
head of a brunette to prevent her looking
like a thunderstorm. Modish millinery is
without form and needs to be arranged with
brains. An unimaginative woman who sets one
of the new hats fair and square on her hair-knob
and stabs it with pins in a matter-of-fact way as
if it were a straw “sailor,” loses half the effect.
But when properly fixed with colors to suit the
veil the hats are just bewitching. I saw a
model in grass-lawn, rather like a lamp-shade but
dressy ; also one trimmed artlessly with chestnut-
leaves and another with water-cress. This season’s
feature is flowers—most artistic and tinged with
decadent tones like petals dipped in ether. They
are not a bit natural, but so chic that the best
thing nature can do is to hurry up and imitate
them as quickly as possible.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The Melbourne Jewish Carnival of Nations
was in one respect a success—viz., as a beauty
show. Financially, its prospects were ruined by
the stoppage of the gaming-tables, which were
‘coining money.’ This occurred by order of
Attorney-General Isaacs after the show had been
open one week, and much gnashing of teeth was
indulged in, as each of the ‘ little horses ’ and
roulette-tables had had a roaring and increasing
business up to then. Upon this the chief reliance
was placed; and despite the attraction of Fitz-
gerald Bros.’ circus, whiph appeared in different
parts of the building at different hours, and in its
own tent from 8 to 9, the profits of the shilling
entrance were not sufficient to save the promoters’
expenses. As a beauty show it was something
gorgeous, and furnished an entrancing display of
lovely Jewesses, who waylaid the public for
raffles, &c. Two red-haired Jewish sisters were
strikingly fine women, and one young lady who
walked with a slight but interesting limp would
have taken a beauty prize anywhere.
“Toorak has been wagging heads and tongues
lately about the manner in which the guber-
natorial crowd rolled up to an at-home given by
a sassiety dame. They had two weeks’ invita-
tion, and when they accepted the hostess, of
course, made preparations on the higher scale.
New gowns of a ravishing description were aired,
and everyone naturally was in full dress, when —
lo ! the Guvment ’Ouse party arrived, hot and
dusty, in the plainest, most workmanlike of biking
costumes, the men in knickers. They had cycled
to the gaudy scene of action as though it were a
roadside pub.
“ Miss Tyrrel Gill is to get her benefit-enter-
tainment at St. Kilda Town Hall, on Dec. 14.
The date, as at last fixed, is about four weeks
later than was intended, the committee having
waited that time for a reply to several letters sent
asking for Guvment ’Ouse patronage. Finally
Miss Gill went to the stucco mansion and was
told, “ O don’t you know whenever you do not
receive a reply it means yes. ” Others have been
in the same fix, expecting an answer from the
oracle whose silence amounts to consent.
“ Mrs. Ellis Rowan, the artist, enshrined in the
memories of Victorians of a certain age as the
prettiest girl of her day, is still at ’Ome. Her
decorative work in one of the English royal
residences is criticised in certain quarters as lack-
ing in artistic arrangement/ though faultless if
regarded merely as a representation of rare and
gorgeous botanical specimens.
“ The wife of a Southern Governor, as often as
not, leaves her purse at home when she goes to
charity fairs, and tells the stallholders to “ enter ”
her indebtedness. At first, the vendors took her
at her word. Now they promise gushingly to for-
: ward the wares, and, later on, dispose of them to
cash customers.
“ A recent Bulletin par. apropos of unwashed
women provokes the statement that some people,
particularly English girls, are almost over-fond of
soap and water, and too contemptuous of anything
in the shape of make-up. So long as they’re young
and pretty, they look well enough tramping about
in strong boots and sailor-hats, with never a veil
to protect their rosy cheeks, shining with cleanli-
ness, from the glare. Later on, when they’re
tanned and seared and browned with years of
tennis and golf, their battered charms seem to
plead for more sympathetic treatment than fierce
facial friction with coarse towels and yellow soap.
The spinster friend of an Australian Governor’s
wife is a case in point. At balls and festivities
s.ie wears her decollete frocks without an apparent
qualm, and, though her face, arms and neck are
just canned-lobster-like with sunburn, her worst
enemy could not accuse her of a film of powder.
“ Cosmetics, of course, must be approached with
fear and trembling. A passenger by a recent P.
and O. laid them on so thickly that she could not
take a bite out of a biscuit without transferring
the carmine from her rosy lips to her plate, as
sworn to by her fellow-diners. The same witnesses
testify that whenever she passed her lace handker-
chief over her snowy brow, its whiteness was
smutted by blacklead streaks from her eyebrows.
“ A much-talked-of will-case sets Gippslanders
thinking of the days, 12 years agone, when the big
bald-headed, bearded old caveator, dressed in a
crumpled silk-coat, flybitten after the manner of
Gippsland summer garments, was as proud as
Punch of hisbonnie brown-eyed girls. Hearrived
at a fashionable Melb. boarding-school once with
one of them in each hand and a lot of their duds
tied up in a big red pocket-handkerchief. Then
he waved off the stately principal, who wanted to
discuss terms, and said he’d pay whatever was
proper, but ‘worn’t there a woman on the pre-
mises ? He wasn’t going to leave his girls with no
man.’ An elderly governess was promptly pro-
duced and his doubts removed, and Dad handed
over his homesick chicks with many tears on both
sides.
“Yet another will-case painfully recalls that
sometimes education causes family troubles. The
youngsters grow ashamed of the old folk and dread
their appearance at prize-givings and speech-days,
dressed anyhow and applauding like whirlwinds.
Long, long ago, when the heroine of a family row
(which less than two years ago figured in the Vic.
courts and is even now only partially decided) was a
rosy eight-year-old, the baby-boarder at a starched
college, nothing delighted her more than to do
Melb. hanging on to the parental coat-tail with
one hand and grasping a big bag of cherries in the
other. ” Y ours affectionately, Cleo

The late William
Morris whatever his
rank amongst poets—was
at all events a man.
“ Literature and Art,”
he said, when indirectly
offered the Laureateship,
“ have no need of official
recognition, and I am
strongly opposed to any-
thing of the sort. And
the Laureate—though he
happened in two in-
stances to be a poet—is
no more, after all, than'
a royal servant. Why
trouble our heads about
the Queen’s domestic es-
tablishment ? ” This isn’t
“literature on all-fours,”
anyhow !
The late Miss Ina
Wildmann got her pen-
name, “ Sappho Smith,”

chaffing her about a set
of rather sentimental
verses she had written,
whereupon she remarked:
“ You seem to like my prose ; you’ll yet like my
verse, too. Pin a perfect Sappho, if you only
knew it.’ And then they called her “Sappho
Smith.”

“ Old Jack ” Robertson used to
relate how, on the occasion of his first
visit to England, he was much mystified
by being urgently requested by a high
British Cabinet minister (Palmerston)
to call on a certain lady—a very fine
woman indeed —living quietly in an
obscure London suburb. “I visited
her before I left,” old Jack would say
when telling the story, “ and cleared
up the mystery. The lady was the
mother of an assigned servant of my
father’s, and she wanted to hear how
the young devil was getting on.
What did the Cabinet minister have
to do with it ? Oh ! the giddy old
man was the convict’s father, that’s all.”
Melb. : “I crave for a preacher.
This city is denuded. The best going is
Sam Chapman, the Baptist, but in
the sere and yellow, much stripped
of the fascinating thick pigments he
used to dab on before being disillu-
sionised by a jaunt to Palestine, the very worst
thing for an evangelical preacher. Rentoul is a
little Scotch, or Irish terrier, always worrying a
bone. Marshall is too recondite, and his congre-
gation too much of the Snoborum, Snobarum,
Snoborum. Bevan’s sermons are like his capil-
laries, ‘ an endless convexity of frizz.’ ”
The Vic. A.N.A. has refused to allow its
Brighton branch to collect subscriptions towards
the erection of a monument to George Higin-
botham, on the ground that sufficient money
couldn’t be raised to do the thing worthily. Per-
haps the A.N.A. is right. Anyhow, Higinbotham
wasn’t the sort of public man who needs a foun-
tain or a statue.
The arrest of Arthur J. Speer, Sydney
City Treasurer, on an allegation of embezzlement
makes the third prominent official of that Cor-
poration charged with misappropriation within
the past few years. City Architect Sapsford and
City Solicitor Merriman went wrong financially,
and would have had to face the court had not
death in ervened.
An incident of N.S.W. Premier Reid’s
Masonic initiation at Sydney was that after
refreshment he and some of the brethren
walked to Campbell-street to catch the midnight
railway tram (which, however, does not stop at
that particular spot). Shaking good-byes with
his new brothers with one hand, and holding up
his other, authoritatively singing out ‘ ‘ Hey, stop ; I
say—stop ! ” he had the mortification to see the
tram speed on and take no notice of him.
The principal personages in connection
with the Adelaide Hospital dispute are nearly all
Scotch, as can be told from their names—Miss
Gordon, Miss M‘Leod, Miss Graham, Dr. Stirling,
Prof. Watson, Dr. Leith Napier and Dr. Ramsay
Smith. Then Dr. Cockburn, the medico Minister,
is Scotch, and so is Dr. Campbell, chairman of the
very select Leg. Council Committee, appointed to
condemn the Govt., and so are Drs. Kinmont and
Morrison, who have just accepted positions in the
Hospital.
Dear Bulletin, I shouldn’t
like to be tried for my life before an
easilv-lachrymose Judge. Hysteria and
cruelty are dangerously akin. Nero
blubbered over his first death-sentence.
“The tiger weeps !” sneered Voltaire
when, with a powerful picture of the
miseries of war, he had drawn tears
from Frederick of Prussia. Also, the
value of judicial weeps is badly dis-
counted by the fact that the Judge
who will snivel over the alleged woes
of a pretty female plaintiff will sen-
tence a mere man to legal butchery
without a drop in his eye or a tremor
in his voice.— Heretic.
Baron von Mueller, like James Payn, con-
sidered that it would be an insult to the intelli-
gence of men of intellect were they not keenly
alive to their importance as members of society.
Wagner, for instance, often removed his hat and
bowed to his own image in the looking-glass. A
visitor who bored the baron greatly not long ago
was induced to make his exit by this characteristic
remark as Von Mueller extended his hand:
“ Goot-pye; dirty minutes of my time is vorth de
whole of your lifetime, and I am ferry bissy yust
now. ”

Dear, kind, fat, bulb
necked evangelist Varley
passed a few obituary
remarks on Du Maurier
in a recent issue of Melb.
Searchlight. The edi-
torial Varley admits tha*
he isn’t personally able t*
pass sentence on the ac-
cursed author of “ Tri*
by,” but his paragraph
entertains no doubt as t*
the Court’s intention it
this case. “We would
not occupy his (Du Mau
rier's) position for the
whole world. In om*
judgment, when he com®
in contact with the har
vest of his ungodly work
on earth, his torment it
as certain as the fixed
stars,” says Varley, wht
evidently looks forward
with joy to the prospeo-
of refusing the other gen

H. R. Fuller, nov
standing as the Defence
League candidate for tha

crippled himself finanoi
ally by his lavish expen
diture when he occupied
a similar position in 1807-8, on the occasion of th*
visit of the Duke of Edinburgh to S. A. He hope*
to be knighted in connection with the celebration
of Queen Victoria’s record reign.
Mrs. Colin Longmuir, widow of the City
Bank scapegoat, runs a sort of supply-kitchen fos
restaurants and tea-rooms at the Block Arcade,
Melbourne. The energetic lady spends a good
deal of her time in making soup—much better
soup than that which her late husband’s bank fell
into.
Rev. Chas. Strong, the Melb. Socialistic
parson, has a son qualifying as veterinary sur
geon, in addition to a daughter at the local Dental
College. In a country where horse-worship is the
ruling religion, Chas. Strong, junior, the vet., will
seem not much less of a minister than his worthy
father.
Rev. H. P. Denison, nephew of Sir W. 1.
Denison, one time Governor of N.S.W., hat
opened a pub. in Portobello-road, London, and
put in a curate as manager. Mr. Denison serve*
none but the purest liquors, and is as strong s
stickler for good English beer as was his uncle
the fighting archdeacon, for good English cheese.
Premier Reid can sleep —in fact, ha
can’t help sleeping anywhere, even on top
of a coach. Being of very full habit, he
wheezes, snores, gasps, chokes, and struggles foi>
air as he sleeps. On the northern rivers one day,
the driver of the leading buggy, in which slept the
Premier, pulled up for vehicle No. 2 to overtake
him. “ Chaps,” alarmedly said the driver as tk.
others drew up, ‘ there s something wrong ’ere—
I think the Premier’s dying ! ” But the o.thets
knew their mark, and one, a howling Proteo
tionist, remarked : “ Oh, drive ahead, and let ’in
bust. Those d d sugar duties won’t be take*
off if he pegs out.”
“The Glenbrook Mystery” is the latest
Sydney sensation. Some weeks ago a young mat
named Preston, formerly of Brisbane, answered
an advt. for a partner to go prospecting. Preston
was studying mineralogy, and he appears to haw
come to terms with the advertiser, and accom-
panied him to Glenbrook, a small villkg®
situated on a spur of the Blue Mountains, 41)
miles from Sydney. Then Preston disappeared—
was swallowed up. A week or two later *
retired sea-captain named Weller answerad
a similar advt., went also to Glenbrook, and
was similarly swallowed up. Also Harwood, th®
man with whom they went, seems since to have
been swallowed up. Both Preston and Welle#
had money with them, little or much; and
Weller had a valuable kit; what the otha»
man possessed is not known. On the morn-
ing on which Weller began to be swallowed
up a local butcher rose early to chop up hi*
meat, and heard two rifle-shots in quick suc-
cession about 4 a.m. A police search brought to
light a number of relics of two of the missing men,
strewn about the bush, or hid in old shafts, or non*
a lagoon by which they are supposed to have
camped with the advertiser—scraps of coats and
leggings, bits of Weller’s pocket-book, and a shirt
with an alleged knife-cut in the shoulder. All
the circumstances point to foul play.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The session of S.A. Parliament just end-
ing is the fourth since Premier Kingston’s acces-
sion, and he has not had to face a no-confidence
motion during the four years. Record?
In the same month the Queensland Par-
liament refused to confer and N.S.W. Parliament
conferred the franchise on the police—both Par-
liaments using the same arguments for and against.
S.A. Govt, has ukased that any Northern
Territory Chows migrating to Queensland will be
seized at Burketown and sent back. And the
Chow, consequently, slips over the border a little
lower down.
When the Great Western Railway grab
had been dealt with by the Tas. House of Land-
lords in the very last minutes of the session, there
was a general clearance of the benches, only seven
members, including the President, waiting to do
the valedictory business.
Two months ago, Q. Premier Nelson
informed Parliament that, “if an appointment
were made to the office of Agent-General, Mr.
Dicken would be the man for the position.” Now
ex-Govemor Norman is the man. Verily a stride
towards Imperial Federation.
P.M. Salmon, who used to misrepresent
Port Melbourne, seeks to oust Longmore from
Dandenong at the next election. Salmon is the
man who went to London, and said he did not
think much of the place as compared with Mel-
bourne, and more particularly Port Melbourne.
Nevertheless, the Port would have no more of him.
“Sydney Journalist,” in a Perth, W.A.,
paper, doubts whether “any of the better class
journals in the colonies ” would have reported
Frank Farnell’s remarks on the approach of Aus-
tralian independence. But why does the great
Sup-press give itself away like this ? The fact that
suppression is exercised should, above all things,
be suppressed.
THE PROGRESS OF ART.
MRS. SQUATTER (to new servant): “ I suppose you can draw a turkey properly , Lucina?”
LUOINA : “ Yis. mum—but I hain’t studied 'still life ’ a great deal.”
The delegates who refused to contribute
half-a-guinea to the cost of the Bathurst conven-
tion were chiefly aldermen, who indignantly pro-
tested that they had been invited under false
pretences. Of the 86 delegates present on the
first day, 34 refused to pay anything.
Murray
Smith has
stated his
strong object
tion to the
idea of “ in-
discriminate-
ly doubling
the number
of voters ” by
qualifying
women to go
to the poll;
but, “ if the
franchise were
limited to
women of pro-
per t y, he
would not
object.” Gen-
erous man !

The N.S.
W ales de-
funct Refer-
endum Bill
appears to
havebeen pro-
duced as a
Constitution-
al freak. One
portion of it
made it a
money bill,
and, there-
fore, law ob-
liged it to be
in t roduced
first in the
Assembly.
But another
portion of it
directly affec-
ted the status
of the Leg.
Council, and,
therefore, law obliged it to be introduced first
there. Unless it was a bird, as Boyle Roche would
say, it couldn’t be first in two , places, and, there-
fore, it’s dead —dead.
An energetic N.S.W. daily paper proposes
to fillip the public mind during Parliamentary re-
cess with the bogey of the French annexation of
the New Hebrides.
History makes itself rapidly in Banana-
land. Where are the crowd who pulled the strings
seven short years since ? M‘llwraith, a lost quan-
tity ; Palmer, invalided and a political nonentity ;
Morehead, relegated to the Leg. Council; Mount
Morgan Pattison, dead in obscurity and poverty;
John Donaldson, too honest to be a good politician,
dead ; Macrossan, too good a politician, also dead ;
Jimmy Taylor, king of Toowoomba, dead. Of
the whole crowd, Sam Griffith seems to have come
out on top. He calmly voted an extra £lOOO a
year for the Chief Justiceship and then grabbed
the billet.
Champion asks a correspondent—
What right have you to compel a neighbor who does
not want his children educated secularly to pay taxes for
the education of your children on your plan, while con-
strained by conscience to pay for his own children on the
religious plan ?
Just so ; some of us feel constrained by conscience
to refrain from travelling on a railway because
some railway trains run on Sunday. Why should
we be compelled to submit to taxation for the
railway debt? Eh? Public utility be hanged.
Let us be strict individualists, pay for what we
get, not for what other people get, and whoop for
“Socialism in our time.”
A WARNING.
(A semi-political cartoon by Hop’s Understudy.)
RUDE LITTLE BOY : “Hi! mister , look out or you'll fall and puncture !”
S.A. Legislative Council, after all, threw
out O’Malley’s bill for the abolition of barmaids.
It also incidentally threw out Bbenezer Ward,
M.L.C. The unctuous Ward stated that the bill
was “a filthy, dishonest attempt, by a Yankee
humbug, to deprive charming ladies of an honest
livelihood.” Then Russell, M.L.C., asked if he
would let his own daughter be a barmaid, and
Ward replied that he would much rather have her
a barmaid in the glare of public observation than
have her a chambermaid in a house where she was
liable to meet a certain M.P. on the stairs or in
dark passages. Then, by the President’s order,
the sergeant-at-arms and a policeman carried Ward
out.
The legal fraternity are well repre-
sented in the Q. Ministry. Out of seven,
four are lawyers. The two departments
calling for men of special training—Agri-
culture and Lands —are bossed by men
whose previous experience consisted in the
main of “To conversation between attorney
and client, 6s. Bd.”
Nothing has been heard of late re
the Sydney County Council scheme. Said
scheme, though admirable in itself, was
advanced principally to distract attention
from the fact that the Local Government
Bill had dropped into the waste-paper
basket for the 37th time, and was being
judiciously left there. Now the County
Council idea seems to have flopped heavily
into the same receptacle, and the two re-
mains lie there together.
Certain N.S.W. Leg. - Councillors
propose next session to “assert ” their right
to nominate their own President the
right, of course, if won, not to take effect
during the reign of Lackey. At present
the Ministry exercises this power, which
practically means appointing a chairman
for a body whose deliberations are sup-
posed to be independent.
It is now hinted that the shortest
and simplest way to put N.S.W. Super-
annuation Fund on a solid basis is to cut
a huge slice off everybody’s pension, pre-
sent and future. Query : If it is necessary
to repudiate something in order to pre-
vent a smash, why not take it off the
British creditor instead of the local one ?
Isn’t one obligation just as sacred as the
other ?
The Kingston (S.A.) Govt, is definitely
against the land-grant railway proposal of the
Anglo-French syndicate, but a motion is to be sub-
mitted to Parliament in its favor. The suggestion
is for a line 1000 miles long, from Oodnadatta to
Pine Creek, Northern Territory. There is another
scheme for a railway from Port Augusta to the
West Australian border, near Eucla. The shindy-
kit disease is pretty bad in S.A. just now.
Protectionist Leader Lyne bespoke at
least one political funeral when he said at
Bathurst, the other day, that “Northern Queens-
land is not fit for white men to work in, and that
Queenslanders should receive some consideration
as regards the right to use black labor.” It is
white men who opened up the North, who toil in
the mines of Charters Towers and Croydon, who
delved on the sweltering Palmer and explored the
Gulf country, and the tale of the white man’s un-
fitness was exploded before it commenced.
A Melb. co. offers to “ relieve the State of
the embarrassment of Mildura ” by taking over the
settlement, putting the irrigation works in thorough
order, and connecting with the nearest railway—
provided said co. is allotted a stupendous land-
grant, and the Government guarantees 3| per cent,
on its capital of £300,000. This is what is always
feelingly alluded to as “ private enterprise.” The
theory is that in bad years the State makes up the
loss; in good ones the co. keeps the profits. It
also gets a big land-grant to help it along. And
the State could raise the money at 3 or 3£ per
cent, instead of 3|, and get the profits for itself,
and keep the land-grant. The Turner Govt, has
intimated to the syndicate that it isn’t taking any.
The Belgian Government proposes to raise
a little revenue out of a national vice. Gambling
clubs are to be licensed, the preliminary fee being
£20,000. Only members can legally gamble, and
there is to be a further tax of £8 annually per
member. This should be a lot more profitable
than the Australian method, under which the
only tax is a £5 fine about once in four years.
Verily they do protest too much. If Aus-
tralians are so solidly loyal to the Foreign Connec-
tion, what necessity was there for almost every
speaker at the Bathurst Pow-wow, from the great
Cardinal downwards, to asseverate gratuitously
and vehemently that Australian Federation will
not be the preiude to Australian National Inde-
pendence? A man, not yet accused, has no need
to assert his innocence.
“ A bonus to art or literature, or patriot-
ism, or anything else, is no more just than a bonus
to butter or beet sugar.” Thus argues Sydney
Daily Telegraph, but before the ink is quite dry
on the sheets the management pack them in ton
lots and send them free of postage or railway
charge by special train through the country, the
Government extracting from the general tax-
payer the cost of the service.
Attorney-General Want held the “rod”
over John Norton’s head until the last moment
allowed by usage. Only on the morning of the
sitting of the court of general gaol delivery was
it intimated that the Attorney-General declined
to prosecute (for sedition). Had he not given this
intimation it would have been the duty of the
Judge in “ruling the books ” to have discharged
the Republican editor from further liability.
One of the less obvious difficulties about
Premier Reid’s idea of a £500,000 new Parliament
I ouse at Sydney is that if the building be to
serve the Federal Parliament it is preposterous to
ask N.S. Wales alone to bear the expense of build-
ing it; and again, if it does serve the Federal
Parliament, will N.S.W. charge rent against the
Federation, or if the Federation take over the
structure will that body “let it ” for the use of the
local Parliament ?
Sectarian grievances, like adversity, make
one acquainted with strange bedfellows. A
recent protest by Att.-Gen. Byrnes in Q. Assembly
anent the truthfulness of an anonymous pamphlet
on Byrnes’ R.C. tendencies (as shown in the sur-
prising promotions in the Justice Dept.) drew
forth warmly sympathetic remarks from Labor-
member Hoolan. Between the two, as a rule,
there is about as much friendship as between Want
and Crick, or Baker and Kingston.
Bowen (N.Q.) railway was discussed in Q.
Assembly, the other day. At present it pays
about 2s. per cent, on working expenses. The
whole of the Northern and Central members, with
two exceptions, voted for its extension. The
members for Townsville, the rival port, were
among the six non-contents. As political rene-
gade Philp is Minister for Railways as well as
member for Townsville, the Bowenites’ chance for
a serviceable railway is akin to Buckley’s.

The case Edwards v. the Melb. Metropoli-
tan Board of Fitzgibbon panned out somewhat as
follows : The board pays between £4OOO and £5OOO
costs incurred in fighting a just claim for £OOO. It
also pays £ll7 damages. Edwards gets £ll7
damages, and out of that he pays about £5OO
costs. Therefore, the difference between winning
and losing the case—which is very much like every
other case —is that the winner loses about £4OO
net, and the loser loses about £4OOO. The only
person who really wins anything is Costs.


New York surgeon John B. Roberts, ac-
cording to the reliable N.Y. Medical Journal,
not only takes out decayed teeth, removes the
sick part, and restores the rectified tooth to its
accustomed socket, but actually saws out sections
of non-bearing jaw, and inserts new teeth freshly
extracted from humans or animals, and these grow
there as if born there.
An aboriginal woman, wife of a boundary-
rider on a backblocks run, adapts herself to the
way of the conqueror by adopting the idioms of
her white neighbors. Her 10-year-old son—pure-
bred, and on whom charcoal would make an almost
white mark—is playing out in the hot sun. She
yells at him : “ Come in here, you young wretch ;
you bin get brown as a berry.”
Gov. Macgregor estimates the present
population of British New Guinea at from 250,000
to 300,000 natives and 400 white people. Ihe
area of the Protectorate is 90,000 square miles.
“ The fever-patient is one who is burning
up nutritive material so rapidly that unless an in-
creased assimilable food-supply is provided he is
quite likely to die of starvation. . . . Atwoik
a man needs more heat than in repose, and more
food. Although the fever-patient does no work,
he produces an excessive quantity of heat, and
this involves of necessity an oxidation of matter.
. . . Those who would abolish alcohol from the
sick-room must first prove their moral right to risk
starving a man because he has the misfortune to
fall ill.”—Prof. Austin Flint, in the Fokum.

That great London thief-paper the Even-
ing News publishes, in its issue of Oct. 9, yet
another Bulletin tale (“Job Pryer ”), unaeknow-
leged, as “ Our Short Story.” Our short story—
the story stolen by the “enterprising’’proprietors.
Judge Murray has delivered his report on
the charges of negligence, or worse, brought
against N.S.W. Works Dept, by Varney Parkes,
M.L.A., and completely whitewashes the Dept.
The . daily papers accept Judge Murray’s verdict
as final. The Bulletin, recollecting certain very
remarkable passages in the evidence, defers judg-
ment till it has digested the whole.
The N.S.W. Landaninkum Tax has got
into another small muddle. The law provides
that there are to be three tax commissioners, also
that “ the present ” Custom House boss, Powell, is
to be first commissioner, and “ the present ” some-
other-official is to be third. The other day Mr.
Powell sent in his resignation as Collector of Cus-
toms, and then several things transpired. (1) The
Act provides for three Commissioners, arid if there
are only two or one it is questionable if the Land-
aninkum Tax will be legally collectable. (2) It
specifies that Powell, as the “present” Custom
House chief at the date of the Act shall be the
first one ; there is no provision for appointing
someone else if he dies or resigns or ceases to be
chief of the Customs department and so ceases to
be qualified. The Act seems to infer that Powell
will live for ever. (3) The third Commissioner is
fixed the same way as the first one. (4) It seems
impossible to appoint a successor to either of
them except by passing an amending Act, and
there is no Parliament to pass it. All of which is
a fine sample of how the average lawyer can’t
draft a law without leaving holes in it that any
intelligent infant would see at the first glance.
We note with pleasure, as an indication of
a revival of trade in Australasia, that the proprie-
tors of Warner’s Safe Cure find it necessary to
enlarge their present premises in Melbourne, and
a three-story building is now in course of erection,
adjacent to their present premises. The popularity
and success of this medicine are evidently a reward
of merit, and we congratulate the firm upon their
increase of business.*

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
The only reason why Martin should be backed
against Parsons in the forthcoming matches is because he
has proved his better consistency and pluck. Behind
pace Parsons has done better than Martin ; for the mile
1*57, as against Martin’s 2 - 6. When the pair met pre-
viously, Martin’s form was Al, while Parsons was off ;
but the contests were wonderfully close. Parsons is very
sanguine now; he will have perfect pacing, and he
hopes thereby to run Plugger Bill off his legs. Bill will
probably be paced by the Dunlop Tyre Co. Parsons
thinks that after the pacers draw off he will have too
much speed for Martin at the finish. He believes he has
learnt enough in America to hang on to the Plugger s
hind wheel and shoot past him in the final effort. Martin,
however, has had a good spell, and should come up fit to
race for his life.
* • * *
This year’s Austral, which appeared such a rosy
thine for the back-mark men, on the contrary proved
peculiarly fatal to them. Walne, on 20yds., and Kellow
on 15, were the only first flighters left in the final. Par-
sons, who made so certain of winning his heat that he
stood out of all prior events, battled with Walne for
three-fourths of the race to make up the cruel gap which
separated them from the field. At the close of the sixth
lap they caught the bunch, and 50yds. from home Parsons
was fourth. But the effort was too much —in the final
sprint he fell away and finished seventh. The interest in
this heat was centred wholly on who would finish second,
for, as early as the middle of the second lap, W. C. Jack-
ion on 180 had passed the limit man on 230, and had
lhaken off all efforts to take his place. While Parsons
and Walne were straining to catch the field the latter had
abandoned all hope of overhauling Jackson and were
leaving him to finish “ on his own”—which he did, win-
ning as he liked by about 70yds. in Newhaven fashion.
Jackson is a strapping fellow of 13st., more the
cut of a policeman than of a cyclist, and, though he rode
100 gear, jumped off his machine at the finish fresh as
paint. He is practically unknown in the cities, but his
road deeds in Avoea district warned the handicappers to
bring him back to 180yds. Possibly had those arbiters
observed Mr. Jackson in training he would have started
about 80yds. further in the rear.
A great race was expected in the heat where
Ken Lewis, Meadham, Middleton, and M’Lean started
around the scratch mark. But all their strength ap-
peared to be used up in catching the field, and a smash
of several riders had the effect of making Lewis steer
wide, after which he dropped out. None of the others
could respond to the sprint, andO. O. Tebbutt, on 190yds.,
riding splendidly, won by three lengths from T. 0.
Fisher, the long Maoriland champion of five years ago.
Young MTnnes, of S. Melb., sprinted in fine
style, and carried off the heat in which Boidi, Pither,
Carpenter, and other cracks started. W. J. C. Elliott
finished third in the same heat. This makes the third
Austral running in which MTnnes and Elliott have been
left in the final. For the past four years, the elder man
has been a warm favorite for the race, but this year no-
body mentions him, and, in accordance with the eternal
cussedness of things, he ought to win it.
Kellow just squeezed into third place in the heat
won by O. S. Prowse, on 160yds., but was wonderfully
fresh, and looked fit to jump on and ride another two
miles. G. Barker, the warm favorite from Tasmania,
came down at a mile and a half in the same race.
On his debut in professional ranks, A. J. Berry,
the son of the Speaker, on 150yds., met none of the top-
notchers, yet he found that there is a difference between
the pace of amateurs and pros. He was badly left at the
sprint, and hadn’t a hope on the start allotted him.
Leo Hesse, the St. Kilda footballer, got third,
which is quite enough, in Peryinan’s heat. Hesse is far
and away the best of this season’s crop of new riders. He
is small, nuggetty, strong, has a big sprint, and is 20
years of age. Had his discretion been equal to his pedal-
ling, he would have carefully trained somewhere out of
the handicapper’s range of vision, and ridden in no races
before the publication of the starts. In such a case his
180yds. might have been extended to 250 or so, and the
£3OO would be his.
Summing up the heats, there seems on paper to
be nothing in the Austral but Jackson on 180. He won
his heat without pacing and without being pressed in
4min. 46seo. Tebbutt, with 10yds. more, did the distance
in the same time, but his heat was a race all the way, and
he certainly shook himself up considerably for the final
sprint. The remaining four heats occupied 4min.
59 2-sths sec., 4min. 55 3-sths sec., 4inin. 59sec. and
4min. 54sec. respectively, and were every one of them
races. Kellow and Walne are good men in first-class
form, but this Saturday they will have a killing gap of
80yds. in front of them, which it will be a miracle if they
make up. Taking all things into consideration there is
no probability greater than—
1. W. O. Jackson, 180yds.
2. C. O. Tebbutt, 190yds.
3. Geo. Hesse, 180yds.
Of Pither, M‘Combe, Ken Lewis and Kuhle,
who started in the final of the International scratch,
Lewis proved himself by far the best, winning by three
lengths from Kuhle and Pither. This race, the most
important of the day from a sportsman’s point of view,
was stripped of all interest firstly by the fall of Parsons
and James in a preliminary heat, and secondly by the
disqualification of Walne and Fitzgerald, who finished
first and second in the same flutter. Parsons’ fall, about
w hich there were a number of silly rumors current, was
caused by Fitzgerald swerving in front and causing him in
turn and swerve into James, bringing both down. Walne
and Fitzgerald were prohibited from starting in the final
for some reason quite occult to the unofficial mind.
Ostensibly thev were guilty of exceeding a time-limit of
2min. 30sec., but neither the programme nor the condi-
tions of racing contain any reference to such a limit.
And, if such did exist, the four men who were permitted
to take their places in the final were all equally guilty.
It certainly looked as if the officials first declared the heat
no race in' order to run it over again to give Parsons a
chance and then lacked the pluck to carry their intention
though. In any case, it is very probable that Lewis would
have won, for Parsons, who appeared with a bandaged
arm and shoulder, showed unmistakeably that he had not
fully recovered from his severe fall at St. Kilda the previous.
Saturday.
The final of the Victoria Mile was really the
best race of the day, Bill Adams (not he of Waterloo,
but of frequent interprovincial rowing contests), proving
the winner, with Walne half-a-wheel behind, after a 200yds.
battle among the first dozen. This race was also hashed
up by M.B.C. officialdom. The starting-pistol no sooner
went than Walne, the backmost man, was bumped by a
pusher-off in front and brought down. The officials did
nothing with great energy for several seconds, until the
crowd began to call “No race, bring ’em back.” Then
those backboneless persons jumped on the track and
waved their arms vociferously, bringing the riders to a
standstill and re-starting the race. This course was mani-
festly unfair to somebody. If Walne was entitled to his
chance—and he certainly had very hard luck in being
upset by the attendant of another competitor—the field
should have been stopped at once. As it was, the men
were allowed to proceed a iull lap at racing speed, and
were then pulled up to compete against the Bananalander
in a fresh condition.
Adams is the only ex-oarsman who did any good,
and he is a man sadly deficient in sprint, probably owing
to his lateness of life in starting cycling, for he is 28 now.
Other starters of Saturday who abandoned the oar for the
pedal are R. E. Dawson, the cause of the interminable
interprovincial squabble ; Fitzgerald, formerly amateur
champion sculler; N. R. Currey, W. T. Matthews, L. Del
Sarte, and O. Peterson.
Gargurevich was put out of the Austral by a
piece of extreme hard luck. A fall occurred, and an
official, running on the track to drag off the machine, col-
lided with the diminutive “ Garfish,” as he is called, and
brought him down as well.
Carpenter, the road crack, despite his previous
successes, seemed completely off on Saturday. In the
Secret Distance under three miles’ contest, he and Boidi
led alternately for the first mile and a quarter, when
Middleton, who had dropped behind, managed to catch
them and squeeze ahead just as the pistol went. Had the
running of the race not proved otherwise, this event
would have looked the queerest thing ever perpetrated on
a cycle-track.
The most disappointing cyclist of the season is
M. M'Lean. Barely 21, short, powerful, and plucky,
M‘Lean is an ideal cyclist, and when in form, at the end
of last season, won the 25-mile championship from Bil-
martin, beating him fairly and squarely in trackmanship,
stamina, and sprint. On Saturday M'Lean was obviously
out of form, and though he started in everything he
finished the day with only a third in the Flying Half-Mile
to his credit. Possibly he has been taking the advice of
his father, a big Northcote (Vic.) tanner : “You stick to
your business, my boy ; business will keep you when
you’re old, and that’s more than cycling will.” The old
man was all right, too.
On the whole, the racing was poor, and the men
whom the public turned up especially to see failed
lamentably. The wind also militated against fast riding,
and the fact was woefully apparent that the Melb. Cricket
Ground is utterly unfit for cycling. The fiat four-lap
track on a fine day is so slippery that the slightest touch
between competitors makes a fall a certainty. If the
League had sufficient pluck, it would order the Melb.
ground, in its present state, to stand down for good ; and
its action in holding its own meetings on such a track
proves that love of sport is quite a secondary considera-
tion to love of hard cash.
One of the most striking figures on the track
was a backblocks cyclist who went to the post in a black
boxer hat, a blue, unmistakably-feminine blouse, and a
pair of partially-ditto linen knickers. A home-made
turn-out.
The tallest rider was the N.S.W. man Jinks.
On account of his lengthy legs and the extended frame of
his machine, he was known as High Jinks.
Hamlin and Alberts, the Coolgardie cyclists,
were altogether outclassed by the Easterners. “ Give us
a stumpy camel-pad,” said the first-named as he strode
off the ground, “ and I’ll have a cut at any of you t’other-
siders ; "but you’re a lot ahead of me on the tracks.”
When Gov. Brassey arrived at the Austral, one
of the officials of the M.B.C. stepped out in a Rignoldian
attitude, and, as the band sounded Gorsave, yelled :
“ His Excellency ; hats off, boys.” Which was strikingly
reminiscent of someone’s famous “ Now, Australians,
three cheers, and take your time by me.”
Not a square inch of breathing-room was avail-
able in the reserve, except the bare space of the steps
leading to the Gov.’s box, and towards that spot a well-
known dentist drew the two fainting ladies under his
charge. The trio had been on the vice-regal stairs about
lOsec. when a gigantic policeman approached and said :
“Those are the Governor's steps, sir, you must come
down.” “ Come down,” yelled the man of teeth.
“Come down! Tell me, please, why I should come
down f The Governor be hanged ! You hear that— the
Governor be HANGED ! Now, just you pull me and
these ladies down.” The constable backed down and
retired to consult his officer, but the face of His Ex., who
had intently listened to the whole scene, was a sight for
snap-shotters. Uncle Tom was apparently waiting for a
thunderbolt to strike the blasphemous dentist dead.
The programmes of the M.B.C. were strikingly
reminiscent of the interviews with great men published
in English magazines. The centre pages were occupied
with a striking likeness of five chairs and a table, repre-
senting the “library of the M.8.C.,” while over the leaf
is a speaking presentment of the secretary s waste-paper
basket.
Despite the loud booming, neither Relph, the
English crack of ’93, nor M'Donell came to the post in
any event. The “Unpaced Road King” has not, so far,
been seen in Vic.
In addition to the 6000 or 7000 deadheads in the
M.C.C. reserve, 11,000 paid for admission on Saturday,
showing a gate of £BOO, as against £5OO for the first day
last year. As it stands now, the M.B.C. will make a pro-
fit of from £3OO to £4OO, if not a soul attends next Satur-
day. The second day’s takings last year were £9OO odd.

“ Phornii,” writing from Melbourne, is of
opinion that Jackson will win the Austral, with Telbutt
second, and Neil Matterson third.
If time-test in the heats goes for anything,
then Telbutt may be reckoned the most dangerous oppo-
nent of Jackson, against the solidity of whose perform-
ance last Saturday there is no arguing. Starting behind
six men, one of them 50 yards ahead, he promptly pegged
himself to the fore and stayed there. He raced “on his
own ” and made fast time, with a great gap between him
and all the men who were pacing one another. His nerve
may fail in the final, or his tyre may burst, or something
else may happen to him. But Jackson, on paper, is cer-
tain to give the £3OO a good shaking. Next to him the
writer fancies Telbutt. Prowse, Perryman, and Walne
■may also have a good look in.

Last week a cycliste was knocked down and run
over by a cab in George-st., Sydney. Truly vanity lureth
to destruction : George-st. is no place for a woman on a
bike. The traffic is too dense, and expert riders, who
carry their brains in their steering wheels, to save their
lives are often forced to perform tricks that on the stage
would be worth a fiver a week.
Walne, the Queensland rider, has jumped into
the favor of Melb. spectators in one act. The great heart
of the Victorian public, who rushed with shilling sub-
scriptions to send Parsons ’Ome, simply bursts with the
longing for someone to come along and effectually wipe
out the pretensions of that newspaper-made “ champion,”
who holds not one Australian championship, and they
look to Walne (who fairly outstayed the one-time Vic. idol
in his Austral heat) to assist Ken Lewis in the much-
needed reform. The Queenslander is not too beautiful on
■a. machine, but is as game as Bilmartin.
* * * *
N.S.W. has two representatives left in the
Austral, viz., Prowse and Elliott. Walne runs for Queens-
land, and the other 15 are Victorians.
At A. J.C. Summer meeting, the Villiers Stakes,
with £5OO added money, will be well worth winning this
year The handicapper has given Malachite, Milkmaid,
Cartridge, and The Chief good chances of carrying off
the prize. In the valuable Summer Cup, Cravat, Ronda,
Sabretache, Rackarock, and Glendennon appear a likely
quintet for the winner to spring from. The Carrington
Stakes seems like falling to Moorefield or Akarini, whilst
Newman, Rackarock, Glendennon, The Meddler, and
Ronda ma 3' supply the winner of Tatt.’s Cup. If Ronda
is worth keeping in training he must show prominently
in the two Cups, as he is literally “ chucked in” in both.

From Patriot’s running’ on Saturday at Rand-

a mortgage on the rich December Stakes at A.J.C. Sum-

Dryden (Mentor—Duenna), perhaps the best
horse in Westralia, bids fair to retain the Perth Cup from
t’othersiders, as he has been nicely weighted with only
Bst. Trentham (9st. lib.), Le Var (Bst. 131 b.) and Destiny
(Bst. 91b.), on paper seem his most dangerous opponents.
The Le Var people have already secured some nice wagers
about their new purchase, but they hardly anticipated
such a big impost.

At Adelaide last Saturday the tote divs. were
respectively : £4 65., £l9 11s., £3 125., £lB 25., £3 195.,
£l3 4s. At Randwick the starting prices of the winners
were severally : 2 to 1, 6 to 4, 5 to 4, 5 to 1, 10 to 1.
After that, what poor punter doesn’t say Tote ?

At the Berry, N.S.W., Show last week, Cham-
pion Era won both the trotting exhibitions for harness
and saddle, fairly outclassing everything on the ground.
Siren 11. took second money in the harness event, but the
judges gave second prize for trotting in saddle to Mr.
Risk’s bay gelding, an unequal-gaited horse. Siren 11., a
splendidly put together little mare by Van Cleeve, the
sire of the world-talked-of Fritz, trotted like a piece of
machinery, and should undoubtedly have secured second
money. Fairfield jumped in his usual faultless style, and
secured both the Hunting and High Jump awards, Mr.
“ Ned ” Black’s handsome little horse Receipt being
runner up. The judging in the buggy-horse event was
probably the most extraordinary ever seen on a show-
ground. Some very fine animals were shown, and the
judges appeared to be the only men on the ground who
considered the three placed horses worthy of a prize.
Dear Bulletin, —It is just a question if New-
haven is the veritable Australasian champion. Maoriland
holds a horse in Euroelydon which, as a three-year-old in
1895, won the N.Z. Cup, the Canterbury Derby, and the
Canterbury Cup 3 miles w.f.a. all at the same meeting.
This year, with a crushing weight, he was just beaten for
N.Z. Cup by Ladv Zetland. And it mustn’t be forgotten
that Bloodshot, ‘ who ran second to Newhaven in Melb.
Cup, and who subsequently showed himself to be a first-
rater, was an unsuccessful competitor with Euroelydon as
a three-year-old.—P. [Bloodshot, however, throws no
light on the relative “ form ” of Maoriland and Aus-
tralian horses. In the one place he was run as a sprinter,
and his owner reckoned him incapable of getting a mile.
In Australia he has been trained for long distance races
and proved a stayer.]
* * * *
That affair at Wyndham, the other Saturday,
will probably lead to a reopening of the “ jockey
ring ” question, which, a while ago, was shut up
almost as soon as it opened. The Vic. jockey ring is an
awful fact, staring every intelligent race-goer in the face,
and laughing at, when it doesn’t grin in company with,
the men who are supposed to maintain Turf decency.
To a great extent it is controlled by Ikey Mo—meaning
Ikey in the collective tense of the term —but, seeing that
the influential Hebrew is often split up into factions and
that other people are sometimes prepared to pay hand-
somely for an “ unexpected turn-up,” the exact working
of wheels within wheels is a difficult mystery to solve.
Only one thing can be sworn to : the prevalence of cronk
racing is immediately due to the mannikins on the horses’
backs, and, whoever may be reaping the benefit of the
arrangement, the public in general must lose by it. Ar-
rangements which didn’t bleed the public would not be
worth carrving out in a general way.

A South Australian member of the Australian
team offers to bet that Australians will never see Ranjit-
sinhji,.who abhors the sea trip, and was once laid up for
three months in India after a voyage from England. The
Australians vote Ranjy a marvel and give him many cen-
turies if he does comes out.

Joe Darling’s big batting in America astonished

But Joe would not risk his wicket in England as Lyons

The Port Australs, the badly-named Adelaide
junior-senior club, is so far at the head of the list in S.A.
cricket. The success of the team is somewhat galling to
the other teams, some of whom opposed their admission
to senior privileges at the start of the season. Their
success is due to the wonderful bowling of Travers, who
would have made a big name in Sydney or Melb., but
under Capt. Giffen he has not had a fair show in big
matches.

M‘QUAID, Plaintiff, and WILLIAM
THOMAS BRAIN, Defendant.
WHEREAS pursuant to a decree made in this
cause it was ordered that it be referred to the
Master in Equity to make the following enquiries
—that is to say : —l. Who was the heir-at-law of
Maria Matilda Brain at the date of her death
according to the law of the above-mentioned
colony prior to the passing of the Act 26 Victoria,
No. 20. 2. Who were the next of kin of the said
Maria Matilda Brain at the date of her death
according to the Statutes of Distributions, and if
any have since died who are their legal personal
representatives.
AND WHEREAS John M'Quade, who was
then about fifty years of age and reported to be
a brother of the said Maria Matilda Brain and of
the above-named Plaintiff, went to Murrumburrah
in the above-mentioned Colony about thirty-two
years ago and is reported to have lived under or to
have assumed the name of John Murphy. The
said John M'Quade (if living) and his children if
any or any of them or other the persons (if any)
claiming through him to be the next of kin of the
said Maria Matilda Brain, if he be dead are re-
quired on or before the Ist day of March, one
thousand eight hundred and ninety seven, to send
in their claims to the office of the Master in
Equity, Chancery Square, King-street, Sydney,

GENERAL DEBILITY
and Indigestion
Made Her Life Miserable, but She is
Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Read the testimony of Mrs. E. G.
Monro, Coburg-, Victoria, whose por-
trait is also given:
m
“Some few years ago I suffered
terribly with indigestion and gen-
eral debility. I could not sleep,
and my condition was such as to
make my life miserable. None of
the many remedies I tried did me
any good, and I despaired of ever
getting better. One of my friends
told me of the blood-purifying and
strength-giving properties of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and I began taking it.
Before 1 had finished the first bottle
1 felt better, and was thus encour-
aged to give the medicine a thorough
trial. In all I used four bottles,
and then was perfectly cured of the
grievous trouble which had afflicted
me. I now recommend, to anyone
suffering as I did.

The right man in the wrong place popped
up unexpectedly the other night at a meeting of
the Sydney Neglected Children’s Homes Society.
“ Begin at the right end of the stick,” advised
this unpleasantly-logical person. “ Look after the
fathers and mothers, and they’ll look after the
children all right. Let’s have more Christianity
and less religion ! ” At which unwelcome chunk
of sense the meeting kicked vigorously.
A New York candidate for the bar was
asked by the examiners : “ Can a wife, after dis-
covering the infidelity of her husband, but subse-
quently cohabiting, then bring action for divorce?”
The examiners were rather staggered by the
answer: “Certainly, for his disbelief in a deity
would be immaterial.” Another candidate’s
definition of law is worth preserving : “ Law is
injustice reduced to an exact science.”
Apropos Melb. inquest-jurors. Before the
era of payment, the coroner always had difficulty
in impounding them for lunatic asylum enquiries.
Once he pressed-in a man who professed to be a
reporter, and thus exempt. The coroner disallowed
it, whereon the journalist protracted a paltry
inquest for three hours, with his conscientious
cross-examinings. Then the coroner swore off
newspaper men.
IMPORTANT TO ALL—ESPECIALLY TO
travellers.—For simplicity and power combined,
use Eno’s “Fruit Salt”; it removes foetid or
poisonous matter (the groundwork of disease) and
thus prevents fevers and malarious diseases, and
all liver complaints. It causes good food to agree
that would otherwise disorder the digestive organs,
or as a gentle laxative and tonic in the various
forms of indigestion use Eno’s “Fruit Salt.”

A case of illusing a greased pig is reported
from North Melbourne. The slippery swine was
let loose among a covetous multitude at the local
recreation-reserve, and, after sprinting 100 yards
or so, it fell into the power of four pursuers, who
fought for the ownership. When the police in-
tervened there was one man sitting on the porker’s
pathetic countenance, two more holding on by the
hind legs, and another claimant tugging at a cord
attached to its neck. The quartette, having been
duly robbed of their prey, were charged with
cruelty to pig and damage to the uniforms of the
rescue-party.
The Eye-sight measure sent per post by
the inventors, Messrs. Greenfield and Barraclough,
the well-known opticians of George-st., Sydney,
is a wonderful little contrivance which will enable
eye-sufferers in the country to ascertain the data
necessary for obtaining proper spectacles. The
subtler forms of sight-defect cannot, of course, be
measured by the instrument, but it is thoroughly
effective for the more usual forms of eye affection
such as long sight, short sight, old sight. Full
particulars from Messrs. Greenfield and Barra-
clough.*

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

REMINISCENCES OF
JOH ANNE SB ERG.
LITE IN THE GOLD FIELDS OF SOUTH
AFRICA.
A DIGGER’S STORY.
In the early days, when gold was first discovered
in the Transvaal, many men left their occupations
and their homes, and trekked northwards in order
to try their luck in the new country. Some of
them found the fortune they were seeking: but
many left the “fields” poorer men than when
they arrived. Not a few never returned at all.
Stricken down by one or other of the many pesti-
lences which are so prevalent in mining camps,
they died, were buried, and forgotten.
“ During the latter part of the year 1886 I left
the colony for the Transvaal Gold Fields, and for
two years I led the life of a gold prospector, which,
as you can well imagine, is a very rough and ex-
posed one. I had bad luck and became low
spirited. Soon after a sort of rash came out on
my chest, and where this rash appeared the itching
became simply unbearable. I scratched and
scratched until the blood ran. This rash soon
covered my body, and caused me great suffering
and uneasiness. At this stage I abandoned
the prospector’s life, and started at my trade in
Middleburg, in the South African Republic, but
suffered so much that I could hardly work. I had
some of the so-called doctors, and also several
really good professional men, prescribing for me at
different times but all to no avail. Friends, as is
generally the case, advised, the one this, and the
other that patent medicine or remedy. I tried
them all, but, like my prospecting, without the
desired result. After four years’ suffering in a sad
state of mind and body, I left the Transvaal and a
good business, and came back to the colony. Doc-
tors prescribed for me, and friends again gave
advice, but they did me no good. I began to
believe that medicine would not cure me, and you
can imagine how miserable I felt. I often read
articles in the Victoria West Messenger, with
reference to cures effected by Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, but by this time had so little faith in medi-
cine that I felt reluctant about trying these Pills.
However, one day a large red bill, which was
stuck on a barrel in front of one of our local stores,
caught my eye, and there again appeared the
words ‘Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.’ There and
then I went into the store and procured a bottle.
This small bottle of Pills relieved me so much
that I followed it up with two more. After using
three bottles of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills I was
cured, and have felt a new man for the last nine
months. I can candidly say that there is nothing
to equal these Pills as a blood purifier. • Like the
Village Blacksmith of old, I can once again use
the muscles of my brawny arms, and can look the
whole world in the face, and only to Dr. Williams
do I owe my gratitude.” Mr. W. Taylor, the
well-known blacksmith, of Victoria West, w T ho
told this marvellous story of his cure to a repre-
sentative of the Victoria West Messenger a
short while ago, further added that he had found
the Pills beneficialfor Rheumatism, and that he will
never again be without a bottle of them in his
house. As a specific for Scrofula, Chronic Ery-
sipelas, and all such diseases, Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills are unrivalled. They positively cure indiges-
tion, sick headache, anaemia, and debility, also
Rheumatism, Sciatica, and Lumbago, while all
forms of female troubles are cured in a very short
time by their use.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are obtainable from all
leading chemists, or from the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Coy., Queen’s Place, Sydney, who will

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
j buyer of all other Australian grems.*

A droll incident in the spread of civilisa-
tion is the fine (one year’s salary) imposed upon
Li Hung Chang for suggesting that the Emperor
of China should henceforth be saluted in Euro-
pean fashion. Up to now His Majesty’s loyal
subjects have always bumped their skulls in the
dust or mud before him, so Li Hung Chang’s new
idea wasn’t likely to strike him favorably. Is
there any recorded instance of a potentate will-
ingly modifying old-established grovel rights?
Queen Victoria has reigned 60 years, but the
pomps and vanities of monarchy are as dear as
ever to her, and if Lord Chamberlain Carington
were to propose an improvement upon the present
humiliating system of bowing oneself backwards
out of the “ Royal Presence” the old lady would
make the radical suffer for his temerity, you bet!
It says a good deal for the almighty Chow’s
wisdom and kindliness that Li Hung Chang
hasn’t died of something with boiling oil or
molten lead in it.

—. -—Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D.:—The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D. —It is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.

“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows: —
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
1 hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.

All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon

Row's Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or

ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and

delicate persons. Young< Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant

Dr. Herman Lawrence informed the Australian Health
Society that, to maintain the skin in a state of ( perfect
health, mankind should take their walks abroad naked
and unashamed.”— News Item.
Says Dr. Lawrence: “If you’d have a pelt of per-
fect function,
A cuticle like bloom of peach, a skin of velvet
purity, . ,
Then hearken, men and maidens, while with true
saponic unction .
I shall prescribe a remedy, unfailing of a surety.
“ The garmenture of folk to-day is harmful in the
highest, ,
And plugs the perspiration pores (pray pardon
this plain platitude) ;
The vestment of primeval man to perfect gaib
comes nighest, ,
Because devoid of longitude and innocent ot
latitude.
“ No nostrum mine of Yankee birth, no Teuton
antitoxin ; .
I simply advocate return to plain and pristine
crudity ;
So do the Block (the while your raiment all remains

With light as with a garment clothed m fact,

An English case has just decided a long-
vexed and interesting problem in the law of
treasure-trove. Defendant had been employed by
Stlaintiff, who owned the land, to clean out a pond.
n the mud he found two gold rings. The court
decided that the freeholder (plaintiff) is entitled
to all unknown valuables found on his land by a
third person. Which upsets many popular notions
of the law, especially that favorite one of child-
hood—“finding’s keeping,” and is contrary to
express statements in the Roman law and to the
opinions of many learned in English law.
Mr. Arthur Griffith wishes to notify intend-
ing patentees that lie has commenced practice as a
Patents and Trade Marks Agent at 39 Castlereagh-
street, Sydney. He has entered into arrange-
ments with leading agents in Europe, America,
Australasia, and South Africa, so that inventors
may rely upon having their interests protected.
Mr. Griffith’s charges will, in all eases, be so
moderate as to place a patent within the reach of
the poorest inventor. For £2O, exclusive of the
cost of plans, Mr. Griffith will obtain Provisional
Protection for any invention in the seven Austra-
lasian colonies and Great Britain.*

“I remember a case,” said a solicitor to
his Worship, “in which a Chinaman who swore
he could not speak a word of English, turned
round at the end of three days’ hearing and in the

well, that’s only natural,” said a still, small voice
at the solicitor’s table, and then a policeman
cried—“ Soilense in th’ Coort! ”
The Salvation Army has freehold in Aus-
tralia valued at .£209,021; leasehold, .£4866 ; and
the approximate value of the big drums and

The other day a cross-examiner in a Melb.
law-court was informed by a scornful witness that
he had “the figure of a man and the soul of a
woman,” whereat the audience laughed. . This
witness, by the way, was a parson, or at least a
qualified performer of marriage ceremonies, so it
may be supposed that the lady members of his
congregation (if he ever had one) gave him a pretty
bad time. In secular circles a female soul is
reckoned rather more respectable than the average
man’s immortal spirit.

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word ; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in an acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best
friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with weaken-

“Let’s play at pretending.”
We had done it ever since we were old enough
to play at all. Our innocent childhood was one
long tissue of make-believe, its happiest hours
those when we imagined ourselves men and
women, heroes and heroines, saints and sinners,
anything save the genuine article of which the
Kingdom of Heaven is composed. It was the
fault of civilisation.
* » • •
“ Let’s play at pretending.”
We still did it when past the age for the King-
dom of Heaven. Only we then usually reversed
the process, making believe hard to revert to the
innocent simplicity of childhood, and wearing a
halo of sweetness and light which was plainly
visible through the looking-glass (our own). Our
happiest moments were still those when we ignored
our true selves and became the heroes and
heroines, saints and sinners, we desired to be. It
was not a striking peculiarity; our neighbors
shared it; their little game of make-believe was
exactly like ours, only not so well done. We saw
through them at once.
It was all the fault of civilisation.
* * * •
“ Let’s play at pretending.”
When tired of our own game, which was but an
amateur performance, we wont to the profes-
sionals. That was the greatest relaxation of all.
To watch the people who' openly made a, business
of pretending was positively restful. The whole
art and philosophy of make-believe was exposed
for our benefit; we lived through the lives of heroes
and heroines, saints and sinners, without exertion,
dreamed through an existence while lounging in
our secluded box. It was better than the faculty s
tonio. But the necessity for the tonic resulted
from fictitious conditions. It continued to be the
fault of civilisation.
• « * *
“Let’s leave off playing at pretending.”
That is what we said one day when the game
and the tonic palled. We were tired, exceedingly
tired. Making-believe no longer worked. The
halo didn’t show up in the looking-glass. We
began to see ourselves in a oominonplace light,
which is bad for aspiration. So one cloudy morn-
ing we said : “ It’s all the fault of civilisation, let’s
flee from it. , Flee to Nature and the Real, which
leads up to the Ideal; flee to the delightful, un-
tutored savage where he sits in the shade of his
own palm-tree, lulled by the lap of his own lagoon-
ripples, innocent of disguise or artifice, knowing
naught of the game of pretending.
We fled.
* * * *
And this is the result. We are sitting in
our stage-box on this glowing June morning, with
palm-plums, green, gold, violet-tinted, waving
overhead, a “coral strand ” at our feet, and the
lagoon lapping beyond. Ourselves, our box and
our opera-glasses are the only suggestions of
civilisation to be seen. The stage is the
roomiest and best-appointed we ever criticised:
its mise-en-scene supplied by My Lady Nature, its
otecors all genuine, its supers, numerous enough to
ruin the manager, its actors letter-perfect with
life-long rehearsal. Arrayed in satiny-brown
tights, worn from birth, they are producing a
serio-comic drama of the Make-Believe school.
This is how the unadulterated native displays his
lack of civilisation and artifice.
It is an exceedingly pretty drama ; we
would not exchange it, on any consideration, for
the latest Sex Problem, or the expected
and Sullivan, or even the couimg Pantomim
Never before have we seen the roßb _

Kfshowing al£ve level black brows: he h» ex-
changed hi. lace ruffles for a huge ae°klaee of red
pandanus berries with bits of fragrant white fibre
tickling his ears. Charles’ general appearance is
suo-o-estive of the call-bell having rung when, like
a dinner-party cod, his head and shoulders alone
were prepared for company : but the dignity with
which that head is set upon these slmulders cl warfs
into unimportance the dingy waist towel which is
his garment of ceremony. “ No matter 1 . I here
are his dainty black satin trunks, woven into his
skin by a professional artist, to make up for all
deficiencies. There, too, is Mrs. Candour her
short hair plastered on end her dead thrust
through a slit of some flowing black material, her
measured strut and curtsey changed to ungam y
capers, vociferating her opinion that neighbours in
general are no better than they ought to be. A
young man from Mikado Land wears a profusion
of leafy attire over a small background of dun-
garee-blue. Don Juan, his hair dyed carrotty-
red, disports himself in the immaculate Joseph s
coat—a rainbow-hued jersey. Robinson Crusoe,
in green kirtle, flourishes the wand of office,
and man Friday, grinning from grey whisker
to grey whisker, executes a pas seul. Mademoi-
selle Nitouche skips past, all smiles and wiles, a
variegated handkerchief crossedover herfull bosom,
a set of tartan handkerchiefs twisted round her
supple limbs, hibiscus tumbling about in her wavy
black hair. Beside her glides. Beatrice, her face
tinted yellow with turmeric, orange muslin
dangling round her warm brown neck, green
muslin fluttering below her waist. Columbines,
two of them, young ladies who have been
abroad for finishing lessons, who wear fringed
shawls for skirts, pink muslin bodices, d6colle.t6s ,
full and floating, from which emerge slight arms
and dainty throats ; their hair is carefully dressed
with pins and fancy combs and pink oleanders,
and they wave and bend and skip and laugh and
then burst into a genuine hornpipe. Past them
stalks the Emu with piowdered head and huge
hunched up kirtle of green and red ti-leaves ; his
hoarse cries are soothed by Maid Marian, who
wears her kirtle over transparent Turkey red,
with a flapping leaf and flower necklace and a low
white chaplet whereof the petals hang on her
forehead. And among them moves Rosalind,
more than common tall, her firm brown limbs
buskined from Nature’s last, her firm brown bust
heaving under scarlet berry croton-leaf and white
spray, her hair stiff with oil, her rustling black
kilt, of native manufacture, cut in an openwork
border like that with which Mrs. Cook adorns her
dresser shelves. Rosalind still dreams romance ;
separate her from Orlando and she defies Fate.
Which accounts for her hair of proud reserve.
* * * *
The argument of the play ? Ask our
actor-manager, seated cross-legged in yonder
thatched hut, with the usual responsibilities lining
his dark face. He takes the part of Prince Give-
away, and is duly oiled and perfumed, hair
stiffened, necklace fresh and full, native cloth
bunched round his waist and creaking with new-
ness. One hand grasps the staff of dignity, the
other works his fly-flapper, and the Smile of
Benevolence wrinkles up his moustache. It is his
benefit-day, with the honor of knighthood thrown
in. Like many another he finds the honor ex-
pensive.
* * * *
“ The Necessity for a Trumpeter,” that is
the title given us. Hitherto our actor-manager, a
very big chief in his way, neglected to retain a
trumpeter for economical reasons. The economy
told against him. To-day he makes amends and
annexes Robinson Crusoe yonder, who is hence-
forth to be his spokesman in the public assembly,
travel with him, sing his praises, conceal his feel-
ings, be his poet laureate, court circular, official
press organ. Small wonder our chief looks
anxious : your poet laureate and press organ are
apt to start off at times on independent gallops
with disastrous results.
And then the wear and tear it has been : placing
benefit tickets were a joke by comparison ! He
has had to go round, gracefully implying his own
poverty, humbly begging, or borrowing, or at
worst buying some of those valuable mats without
which no trumpeter can be retained. Half at
least of the precious ie tonga to be given away to-
day have been contrib’.u-d, and he will be heavily
mulcted in return. ¥ r “give that it may be
given to you ” is the Samoan motto, and woe be
unto the recipient who ignores the latter clause.
* * * *
Robinson Crusoe knows all about it—
knows his value to a mat. And he has been levy-
ing, too, not mats, but food, for the village which
honors him by selection to the post of Tulafele.
Food in abundance : cooked pigs, big- and little,
ranging in value from a dollar to £6 ; baked fish,
the produce of many fishing “bees”; yams and
taros sufficient to induce chronic indigestion ; they
have all been presented and cried aloud and called
forth thanks, and here comes the return in the
form of Tulafele’s fees.
* * * *
And. what fees they are, to be sure. How
astonished everyone is, as woman after woman,
Rosalind at the head, sidles out of the actor-
manager’s hut displaying one of the fine pandanus
mats which form the Samoan wealth and pride.
How liberal, how unexpected, was such generosity
ever before dreamed of ! Who could have
anticipated such a surprise! Can these forty
beauteous heirlooms really be for the deeply grati-
fied Tulafele, all unworthy as he is? Watching
the comedy of humbug, it dawns upon us that
civilisation is not so terribly at fault, after all.
* * * *
The Emu hops and straddles up to our
box. “ Isn’t it fine ? ” he cries, “ isn’t it splendid ?
Ever seen such mats before? Ever seen such
doings ? Fa’a Samoa, ah, we do things well, fa’ct
Samoa. He, he, he ! ” And he capers off, his
green and red leaves tossing with every skip and
displaying the black tattooing. Emu belongs to
the mat-giving faction, and is bursting with self-
approval.
£ * $ *
The mats having twice circled roundfor dis-
play, the giving commences in earnest. Robinson
Crusoe and Maid Marian, Friday and blue-green
Mikado, have their work cut out for them. As
each mat arrives they utter shrieks of welcome,
dance a vigorous clog step, rush to and fro
brandishing clubs, assault innocent trees, struggle
with an imaginary foe, and finally butt their
heads against the mat itself, as the most con-
venient way of placing an awkward gift on the
top of your head with salaam. Now and again
the columbines run forward to relieve them, and
bend and bound, bow and kick, twirl and whirl,
and drop into their hornpipe. And so it goes on
amid shouts of triumph and cries of fala lelei and
entr’actes of speechifying, till the 40 mats, repre-
senting in native eyes some £3OO, have been handed
over, and the recipients subside and quietly w;.U h
the streams of less-important native clo h which
are borne on the shoulders of the givers, like trains.
* * ♦ *
Then the rain falls. It has been carefully
kept in reserve till the proper moment; now, when
fun is flagging, it sheds its refreshing shower
through the palm branches. No theatrical illu-
sion about it: genuine glistening raindrops im-
parting a fresh, grey-blue beauty to the stage. The
subdued atmosphere is on for the last scene and all
take their cue. The visitors bundle up their
treasures and troop off under the palms and along
the lagoon, a genuine pantomime procession.
When they reach their own village, and reckon
up all the pigs and other succulent matters that
have left it, Tulafele will have his bad quarter-of-
an-hour. One by one he must hand over all his
new possessions, lucky indeed if he be allowed to
keep the smallest and coarsest mat for himself.
When he lays his head on his bamboo bolster he
will wonder what there is, after all, in being some-
body else’s trumpeter.
* * • *
And in our own village, at the back of our
stage-box, they will gather round the circular-fires
and tear the pork asunder, and sigh as they suck
the fat lumps. Then the women will think of the
siapo they will have to make afresh, of the mat-
plaiting that will fall to the more expert, of the
great-great-grandmother’s ragged, brown heirloom
which will never find its way back unless some
bride bring it in her dowry. And they will won-
der what there is, after all, in possessing a chief
with a trumpeter.
* * * *
Shakespeare is reported to have mentioned
that all the world’s a stage. Somebody ought to
have mentioned it long before Shakespeare ; in-
deed, the original reporter, stationed near the
celebrated Eden tree, might very well have noted
the fact. I have no doubt that Mrs. Eve had
carefully rehearsed her historical scene, with Adam
for prompter. The poor lady was only “ playing
at pretending,” and had no notion that her stage-
villain was the genuine article, entailing life-
consequences. Poor, maligned civilisation, it
never created The Philosophy of Make-Believe, it
only Bowdlerised.
But you have to come to our stage-box under
the palms to realise the fact.

Miss Sutherland, of neglected-children

country lately an amorous old gentleman asked
her why she didn’t get married. She replied :
“ I have too large a family to look after.” “ In-
deed ! ” said he. “And how many children
have you?” “Oh, about 1400,” she answered,
pointing to one or two ragged waifs, whom she
was taking to foster-parents’ homes as samples.
Whereupon the old gentleman cooled off, and
seemed more interested in the prospect out of the
window than in Miss Sutherland.

Wanted—A Governess.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
? AYN s^oo( i in the doorway ; her husband
and Miss Denton, the governess, stood near the
window. Miss Denton’s face was aflame and her
bosom heaving. Payn had turned his back, his
hands deep in his pockets.
Mrs. Payn had a few words to say, and the girl
winced as if she had been struck. One sentence
in particular caused her to catch her breath in a
quick sob and bury her face in her hands to hide
her shame.
“Yon can go now,” said Mrs. Payn at length,
coming forward into the room, as if to avoid pos-
sible contact as she passed through the door.
“You will want to pack. I will see that the
buggy is ordered in time. ” Then she took some
knitting from a side-table and sat down by the
fireside, and for some minutes there was silence.
Payn turned abruptly. “ It’s d d hard on
the girl, Mary—it was all my fault.”
“Always generous, Cyril; but I cannot dismiss
you, you see.” She went on with her knitting.
“ Look here—” he seated himself opposite her—
don’t you believe me? ”
“Of course, Ido ; but what then ? ” Her calm
acquiescence was somewhat disconcerting, and she
counted the stitches on one of her needles in an
absorbed manner.
. 11 You don’t wish me to keep her, do you ? ” she
inquired.
• i on care what you do; but you had no
right to speak to an innocent girl in that way, and
call her ”
Mrs. Payn's eyebrows had elevated themselves
at the word “ innocent.”
“ Mary, slate me ; Heaven knows I deserve it!
but don’t punish the girl.”
“There was a discussion very similar to this
little more than a year ago, you remember ; but it
was Miss Posberry then.”
He did not answer; his head sank on his chest.
The needles clicked steadily.
Presently she spoke again—she had hastily
wiped away the tears that had risen to her eyes—
You do not wish the girl to stay here, but, even
if you did wish it, I could not keep her. You say
the blame is yours. I am well aware of that.
You are attractive to women, and it has been a
curse to them and you. Can any of my sex say
that she remembers with pleasure, or even without
shame, a close acquaintance with you? Your
weakness hurts ” —she laid stress on the words—
“innocent women. I have learnt to distrust you,
and to expect such things as a matter of course.
Probably of the three persons in question at
present I am by far the least affected.”
Payn saw a loophole, and took instant advan-
tage: “ That’s just it, if you cared more, I .”
He looked up and met a scornful smile, which some-
how made him forget what might make an impos-
ing finish to his sentence.
W(3 won’t talk of that,” she said, quietly.
My feelings are not really concerned in the
matter. You have injured the girl, and are put-
mg in a plea for her. You are quite right, I will
see what can be done.”
Mary, I am sorry I don’t know what comes
over me. lam a weak fool, and yet through all I
love you more than anyone else.”
The needles went steadily on. “ X suppose you
uo, Cyril, but that makes little difference now.
Your love is nothing to be very proud of, for it
lacks honor, even common decency; but it is un-
fair the girl should be the scapegoat.”
And in the reference Miss Denton took away
with her Mrs. Payn stated that she was tooyoun°"
to manage headstrong boys, but otherwise was
eminently satisfactory.
“ I must get an elderly person,” she said to her
husband. “It is unfair to the children—it would
be so much happier for them to have a young girl
with them—but you leave me no choice.”
M.D.
Fennell.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Most men live in the present; some live in the
past, some in the future. Fennell lived in none
of these, but in a world of his own—as Poe has it,
out of space, out of time.” That is all very
well, but this world is rude, and breaks in upon
the dreamer roughly and ruthlessly. The world
broke m upon Fennell in this wise :
He loved a woman. He loved her in his own
strange fashion, which at bottom was the fashion
of all men, and only externally strange. Though
he did not live in the world, he yet had instincts
and sympathies in common with those who did,
and some one of these instincts told him that she
whom he loved was not for him. So he loved her
more and more.
He saw the woman was not for him; yet he
knew that she loved him in a way which accorded
strangely with the ways of his own world that was
out of space and out of time. This kind of love is
that which shall be in the land where there is no
marrying nor giving in marriage. His own love
for her was of the other kind.
As usual, there was a third actor in the comedy
—a man of this world and of no other—a man to
whom the present was everything and everything
else nothing. There are such men. They have
certain debonair and diabolic graces for which
women love them. She loved this man.
In Fennell’s world—out of space and out of
time renunciation is not difficult. Your true
celibate lives in such a world. Fennell could have
reconciled himself to his loss of the woman in the
knowledge that it was her gain. Unfortunately,
inexperienced as he was, he saw clearly that the
man she loved—the man to whom this world was
everything and every other thing nothing—would
not give her happiness, but bring ruin upon her.
In common with men with whom he had nothing
in common, he saw this plainly. So he became
the man’s secret enemy, and plotted against him
m the way of one to whom the rectangular laws
and customs of the world that is are as nothing.
The man’s life was a thing of no account beside
her happiness.
She, a fiery blonde, warm-blooded and impul-
sive, made no secret of her love to Fennell, be-
cause Fennell was to her more than a brother : he
was a kind of sister. Souls are feminine. But
Fennell saw a slight shadow on her brow ; and the
signs of impatience were on her lover's face—the
vicious impatience of a man who finds some con-
quest more difficult than he expected. So he de-
layed no longer, but brought his plotting speedily
to an end.
The man was found dead, with a knife in his
heart.
. Fennell escaped even suspicion. He gave no
sign, but went back to his own world, which knew
nothing of ethics, of laws and punishments, being
out of space and time. His instinct told him that
her grief would be great, and his heart bled for
her ; but he rejoiced that she was free, though he
knew that she was not for him.
He allowed the time to pass—one month, then
another, then some days. She was not so fiery a
blonde, nor so impulsive, now, and there were
hard lines about her mouth. But this was
natural; one does not lose a lover and show no
sign.
She was calm, but pre-occupied. To him she
showed a sweet graciousness that was slightly em-
barrassing. But a time came when the Tight
broke suddenly upon his misty mind. She loved
him.
And the other? Ah, it was only a flash of
fancy—intense, but evanescent. He was easily
deceived, being in love.
So he came back into the world that is, and
looked at his hands, and saw that they were red.
He thought of her white soul, and shuddered. No,
she was not for him.
But sophistry came to his aid—and she came to
the aid of sophistry: between them—unwitting
allies—he was conquered. The lines about her
mouth grew soft, her impulsiveness came back,
and she was again the fiery blonde. His brain
swam at the softness of her arms, and he urged
her to an early marriage.
When it was all settled, she again grew pre-
occupied. She looked at him with a pleading,
wistful glance; and once she shook her head and
sighed deeply. The day before that appointed for
the marriage, her majiner took his attention, and,
looking into her eyes, he saw something there
that was not pyre, not candid. As he looked, a
nameless fear crept round his heart like an icy
snake, and his face blanched. She sank down at
his feet with a low cry.
He said no word. The snaky fear tightened its
coils around his heart and stopped its beating.
Suddenly she sprang up and stood before him,
calm and almost defiant.
“ It’s no use,” she said, harshly, “ I cannot do
it. I thought I could, but ”
“ Marion,” he said, finding his voice at last,
“what is it?” He felt miserably weak and in-
capable ; but all at once a strength not before
known came to him, and, taking her hand in a
firm grasp, he said : “ Did you give yourself to—
Her e y es s P°ke despairing assent.
Then I was too late, after all. . . . Yes, it
was I that killed him ... to save you.”
Maybe her despair left no capacity for horror or
even su p use; she evinced none. She grew
calmer e e y moment.
“ It’s all the same,” she said; “you have not
savedme . . , others perhaps ”
<( He would not have married you.”
Axnl ’ r^^lere was a l°ng silence.
<i rriu are y° u going to do ?” he asked.
1 here are many ways. . . . The river ■
yo?” 6 ** U can l° r si ve me for deceiving
Tor anything. How far—did—your deceit
go?”
A faint flitted over her face. “Dear,”
she said, “ the better part of me has always been
yours. That is why I could not do it. . . Yes,
there is but the one way out.”
He looked at her in his old dreamy way.
You are full of life,” he said ; “ your vitality
will spurn despair. Wait awhile and see. . . .
1 nave killed ; yet it grows less and less to me.
lhe past is dead ; the present is but half-alive ;
only the future really lives. . . . Let us live
in the future—together.”
“ Is it worth while ? ”
He took her hand. It was trembling, and he
knew that the tears were near. Then the
paroxysm came. She threw herself upon his
breast, and they wept together.
The appointed ceremony took place. She went
with him into that world of his that was out of
space and out of time, and there they piled the
present on the past, and buried it deeper as the
years slid by.
