m
The extraordinary reputation of Rowland’* Macassar
Oil, Kalydor and Odonto, induces some shopkeepers t<i
offer Bpnrious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland & Sons, of 20.
Hatton Garden, London, and therefore it is highly
necessary to buy no Macassar Oil. Kalydor or Odonto
except those made by them, end which bear their

BUCKINGHAM PAEK ESTATE,
MEDLOW (Blue Mountains)-
This charming Estate has its Railway Platform almost
adjoining, and its level land proves it to be eminently
adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to have
lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PARK,
which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKED
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large—from i.OO up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
. The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas arc
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLAOKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are libera',
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Prc
prietor,

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hii
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

gressions or excesses of more nature ago, bladder

SATURDAY, JULY 25, 1891,
Wanted—A Popular Government.
The appearance of a third party in the New
South Wales Legislature is an event which is
calculated to play havoc with the ancient
system of Government inherited by this new
nation from, its British forefathers. It is not,
of course, by any meaps a surprising circum-
stance that there should be three parties in
any political assemblage—the truly surprising
circumstance is that the Constitution makes
no provision for such an event. Even if
there were twelve parties instead of three
there would be nothing astonishing in that
fact, for in any time of political excitement
even a small nation can generally raise
material enough for a dozen well-defined
factions, each furnished with a sufficient
supply of fads, visions, animosities, and cast-
iron prejudices for a whole Parliament.
And, on the other hand, it may sometimes
happen that the people, in a period of tem-
porary stagnation, cannot produce even the
two parties that are needful to keep the
ancient machine of State in motion. The
Liberals and Conservatives of Victoria, in
the days immediately preceding the Coalition,
were, in every essential, one and the same
faction. There was not between them one
solitary point of difference that could be
distinguished by the naked eye, and though
they blocked the business of the nation, and
howled wildly at each other, they only howled
as a matter of form. If the whole Assembly
had consisted of Alfred Deakin using bad
language at himself the country would have
got there just the same. But the Constitu-
tion makes no provision for this contingency
any more than for the other. It is based
entirely on the assumption that a Legislature
must resolve itself into two sections—the
one which has got the jobs and the money
and the perquisites, and the other one which
is trying to get them. The men who con-
structed it assumed, with soul-destroying
frankness, that the jobs and the money were
the only things that any Legislature was, is,
or ever could be, in search of. They knew,
as everybody else must have known, that a
Parliament which was governed by principles
was liable to split into three sections, or
twenty, or to consolidate into one under the
pressure of unexpected circumstances, and
then to rend itself again into forty-five ; but
they took it for granted that no Parliament
had or could have any principles at all.
There was a grim, shameless, conscience-
sodden, sin-blasted candour about these old
constitution-mongers of the past, that was
almost admirable in its depravity.
» * #
The system of payment of Parliamentary
representatives has done more than anything
else to upset this sinful calculation. Hitherto
when the nucleus of the third party has been
formed, it has generally been only to dis-
solve again when its members realised that
they were wilfully throwing away their share
of the loot—the only thing that made politics
worth living for. The other two factions
took turn-about at holding the bag, and the
new division was left out, and therefore it
became absorbed in course of time and aban-
doned its isolated position in order that it
might claw for the bag like the rest. But
when every member is paid on the same
scale, there is less reason for joining in the
insane scramble for steals and pickings. The
third party can afford to neglect these ad van-
ages and wait patiently till it grows strong
enough to assert itself ; and so can the fourth
and fifth, and the other parties right up to
the twelfth, or even beyond it. Therefore
there is every reason to believe that the
old system by which the Legislature sinks
all its alleged principles for the sake of
dividing itself into one Government and one
Opposition, is approaching its end. The
country wants freetrade in the matter of
legislation, also freedom of contract in
engaging its representatives ; and the com-
plaints in the Tory press about the disorgani-
sation of Parliament look promising. Par-
liament wants to be disorganised, and the
only trouble so far is that there is no present
sign of it being one-tenth so much dis-
organised as it ought to be. There is no
more sense or justice in compressing the
nation into two political parties than there
is in condensing it into two religious sects.
The absolute freedom which applies in the
one case is equally applicable and equally
essential in the other.
* * *
The system of one [Government and one
Opposition is played out. In place of it the
nation requires no Government at all, in the
ordinary acceptation of the term, and either
twenty-four Oppositions, or ten, or none,
or one hundred and twenty, just as the cir-
cumstances of the moment may dictate. In
other words, it is time to establish govern-
ment by Parliament in place of government
by a Cabinet. And to effect this result it is
essential that the Premier and each indi-
vidual Minister should be elected, at the
opening of each new Parliament, by the
vote of the whole body of representatives,
as the first step towards abolishing a system
which is a mere burlesque on the alleged
principle of popular government.
* * #
To realise the necessity for this reform it
is necessary first to consider the numerous
absurdities of the present method. The
House is artificially divided into two more
or less equal sections, and each section has a
leader, and these two leaders enjoy between
them, a perpetual lease of the Premiership.
The average Parliamentary leader keeps a
half-share in the Premiership until the day
of his death, and neither his party nor his
country knows how to get rid of him. The
country, for instance, might resolve to shift
Parkes, but if the smallest and meanest and
mpst ignorant constituency in all New South
Wales would put him in by 24 votes against
23, he would remain immovable. There is
at least one constituency in, every country
which is foolish enough to return anybody,
a,nd this circumstance keeps many an,ancient
incubus going. And thq Foreign-trade
party in the House could no more shift
Parkes than could the party optsidp. The
onq essential is to keep the party together.
Internal upheaval might lopsen the hold on
the Treasury, and therefore if any section of
the Legislature has secured a leader whp has
an octopus-like grip on the money-hag it
must put up with him, even though he may
be of use for no. other purpose whatever.
Experience has shown that Parkes, could
hardly be blasted off the front bench with
dynamite, and therefore his position as the
Freetrade boss is about as sequrq as any-
thing on this earth well can be. It takes a,
greater revolution, in many casqs, to shunt a.
hardened placeman it dpqs to move ap
emperor, but the country puts up with, this
under a mistaken impression that has
elected the placeman of, its own free will,
and elevated him to his plape of honour. If
the Foreign-trade section of the community
would endeavour to formulate, somq,scheme;
for declaring, at the polls, ' that it' wanted,
Foreign-trade, and yet didn’t wanf Parkes,
it would begin to realise the fallacy of this
theory.
* # *
The Government is not even nominally
appointed by the people. When a political
crisis arises a certain foreign person at
Government House “ sends for ” the prin-
cipal placeman, and entrusts him with the
formation of a Ministry. He does this on
the advice of the retiring placeman, who had
been previously “ sent for ” in the same way.
If one of these placemen cannot fill the bill
he sends for the other, and if the other one
be equally incapable he sends for the first one
over again; He keeps on sending, in short,
until he is worn out. Each party puts up
with its oivn leader because of his lobster-
like capacity for grabbing office with both
claws ; and each one has to support its boss
when he is “ 6eht'for,” because, should it
fail to do so, the hated individual opposite
will be “sent for” instead. The newly-
appointed Premier appoints his own sub-
ordinate ministers, so that here also the
nation has no voice in the arrangement. If
by any chance, however, both the leaders
fail at an emergency, the Governor generally
tosses up, or decides by some other game of
chance peculiarly his own. In this way the
Queen’s representative in Maoriland once
nearly made a statesman out of a person
named Thomson, whose sole qualification lay
in the fact that he always moved that he,
the said Thomson, had no confidence in. the
Ministry. And on one occasion, to his own
amazement, his motion was carried, and
amid the prevailing disorganisation he was
sent for, in a flabbergasted state, and re-
quested to form a Cabinet. In this case the
scheme fell through, but when one Governor
made a Premier out of Jennings, and
another did the same with o‘Loghlen, it
was playing matters very low down on a
free people.
* * *
When the country has been supplied with
a ready-made Government composed of such
materials as Abigail and O’Connor and
Gould, and has accepted it lest it should
strike a worse snag in the shape of a Govern-
ment composed of Willis and A. G. Taylor,
this parody on the Parliamentary system is
still uncompleted. For, in reality, nobody is
allowed to legislate except these half-dozen
nominees, not one of whom is, in any sense,
appointed by the nation. One night per
week, on an average, is devoted to the
business of private members —who compose
nineteen-twentieths of the people’s repre-
sentatives ; all the rest is laken up by
“Government business.” Under these con-
ditions any measure, proposed by any indi-
vidual outside the Cabinet, of which the
Cabinet does not approve, is easily talked
out and smothered, for the whole govern-
ment of the country is in the hands of
the nominee Ministry. The Parliament, it
is true, can revenge itself by throwing out
the Ministerial proposals, but in that case
that irresponsible body resigns, and another
equally irresponsible body takes its place,
and conducts itself in the same rampant
fashion. And the final result is, that the
only purpose which is served by having a
Parliament at all, is that it is a handy thing
to throw out the Ministry with when that
body becomes too obnoxious; and if arrange-
ments could be made for throwing out the
Ministry by machinery, then the country
would get on equally well with no Parliament
at all.
* * *
Therefore, The Bulletin desires to sug-
gests plan of Parliamentary reform something
like this. The Ministry should expire by
effluxion of time along with the Legislature,
that each new Legislature should elect a new
Cabinet, each member being chosen sepa-
rately, by open vote of all the people’s
representatives. . The Governor may after-
wards “send for” the Premier, if he feels
so inclined, but whether he is sent for or
not, or whether he goes or not when he is
sent for, the individual so elected and his
colleagues shall hold office till the expira-
tion of Parliament. They will not possess the
confidence of the House, for the House will
possess its own confidence, and stick to it.
There will be no “ Government business” in
the present acceptation of the term, excepting
the Financial Statementandany departmental
matters which cannot be attended to without
legislative sanction. If the House objects
to the financial proposals it may alter or
refix them in any way without thereby
expressing a, want *of confidence in the
Cabinet,, and, without that body clearing out
in a huff. Th ; e Government shall have no
programing a,t all, but each member of it and
of the Hpuse shall bring in any bill or motion
that h.e wants to, on his own responsibility,
and the House shall decide by vote, taken
without debate, which matter requires
earliest attention. By this means the system
now in vogue, whereby any measure, how-
ever important, which is introduced, by a
private member, can be crowded out by the
Cabinet when it wishes to. avoid committing
itself, will be abolished ; and, if some obscure
Labour member desires to bring ip a measure
for the extinction of the Upper House, or
the Governor, or the plural voter, or any
other trifle, he will stand exactly the same
show, of a hearing as if he were a live
Minister who wanted to vote a loyal address
to ap obese monarch. The Cabinet, in fact,
will,be merely an executive body appointed
tp,carry out the decisions-of the House, and
tlip House itself will be the Government in
the true meaning of the term. It will dis-
solve itself any time when it feels so inclined,
by the vpte of, an absolute majority, but it,
will not be dissolved, either, by, the Cabinet
or the Governor or any outside authority.
The advantages of such a scheme as the one
of which a rough outline is here given are
sufficiently obvious. Itwould enable the Legis-
lature to crowd through equally well, whether
it contained one party or twenty-fpur. It
would enable the people to appoint their own
rulers, instead of being governed by mere
nominees. And it would enable any legislator
to serve his country as well in a private
capacity as he could if he had been “ sent
for ” by an imported nobody, or had lent
money to some person who was sent for, and
consequently got himself sent for at second-
hand.
The “Labour” Party.
There is much to be said in favour ofj woman
suffrage. There is much to be said against it.
We are not now going to discuss the question
from either stand-point. In fact, we are not
going to discuss it at all. We merely wish to
make some comments upon an argument,, used
by the lady who is courageous enough to put forth
her views in Sydney Daily Telegraph, over
the oddly-chosen signature Faustine. Faustine
quotes the declarations of ‘‘thinking men” that
they would be glad for women to have a voice
in the government, “as they would represent
most strongly that Conservative element which
the present time stands in need of.” She adds
her approbation, “taking Conservatism in its
better sense.” This is what Faustine considers
an argument for woman-suffrage. As a matter
' of fact, it is one of the strongest arguments
against it. The market is overstocked with
“ Conservatism in its better sense,” which
means in Faustxne’s sense. What that sense
is, appears inter alia from her objections to the
abolition of land-monopoly :
We shall have a charming railway shrieking and grunt-
ing and snorting through all the fair forest glades of
England; a row of two-storey houses with highly-deco-
rated iron balconies adorning the sunny, velvety slopes
surrounding old historic seats; and beautiful Rome,
Florence, Naples, Athens, Madrid, will all have fallen
under the hand of the spoiler.
And so on, and so on. “ Conservatism in its
better sense ” is evidently only another name for
ghastly ignorance, and we don’t quite see the
use of a roundabout expression when the plain
English is there to your hand. What Faustine
ought to know, and what any woman fit to vote
does know, is that any railway which is a mere
desecration and a desolating nuisance is one of
the fruits of land-monopoly. The jerry-built
terrace is another. What takes the colour out
of the landscape and the brightness out of the
sky and makes life an eyesore and a dreary wil-
derness is just this very monopoly that “ Con-
servatism in its better sense ” is determined not
to let go. The aim of democracy, the business
of modern radicalism, is to cure these evils, not
to encourage them. If women want the suf-
frage, and want to know what to do with it
when they have it, they will do well not to fool
round with “ Conservatism in its better sense.”

But this is only a preliminary digression. It
is when Faxjstine gets to the labour-question
that she shows the real grip she has on the big
social problems of the century, and vindicates
the claim of her sex to take a part in directing
the national affairs.—
Labour! We all labour, from the prince to the peasant.
We have very few “lilies of the field” in these breath-
less, energetic days. With all the faults of the heir-
apparent to the British throne he works hard. Great
statesmen, literary men, artists, musicians, confront us
with their labours every hour, many of them working
cheerfully 18 hours a day, and not always for monetary
reward.
This is not new, nor is it very true. It is also
slush. It is the kind of idiotic drivel that
premiers and bishops and judges and other fossils
are everlastingly inflicting on a suffering public,
with a sort of infantile delusion that they are
making a valuable contribution to political
economy. They seem to fancy that it ought to
implant a spirit of content in the pampered
dock-labourer, with his inflated wage of six-
pence an hour. It doesn’t. They have an idea
that it has some important bearing on the ques-
tion of trades-unionism, or the “ freedom of
contract ” difficulty, or the representation of
labour in Parliament. It hasn’t. The suggested
argument is something of this kind. The
Prince of Wales toils through the long nights
struggling against bad luck at the baccarat-
table, and W. E. Abbott writes letters 18 hours
a day to prove to the New South Wales country
papers that the Labour-party couldn’t possibly
get any candidates in at the general election,
and any given Old Moneybags has no end of
trouble and anxiety to secure more than about
15 or 16 per cent, on his investments ; therefore
the Prince of Wales and W. E. Abbott and
old Moneybags are all labourers ; and as the
Labour-party has no express authority to
represent them, it isn’t a Labour-party at all,
and has no right to use the name, and conse-
quently ought to be indicted for burglariously
obtaining the said name under false pretences.

The Duke of Argyll, who has a general
retainer for the propertied classes to twaddle
in their interest on social questions, and who is
eternally being quoted by the Australian daily
press, has applied his gigantic intellect to this
subject. In answer to some queries put by the
Dundee Radical Association about labour repre-
sentatives in Parliament, His Grace first cleared
the ground by remarking that a definition of
“ labour ” was necessary before we could solve
any question concerning it, and then he went
on to define labour. Mind was the prime
mover in all work and wealth. Every capitalist
was a labourer when he exercised forethought
in storing income, and still more a labourer
when, he risked his savings or his storages in
any commercial enterprise. From which it
followed by nice easy stages that trades-
nnionism was a swindling conspiracy of
muscular labour “to take out of the hands of
mental labour the whole control of enterprises
in which muscle has had only a. very subordi-
nate share.” If the Duke says that sort of
thing just because he doesn’t care what he says,
he ought to be exposed.. If he says it because
he doesn’t know any better, it is quite time to
enlighten him.
* * *
Nobody denies that labour is a term of wide
scope. We are tired of hearing that the Chief
Justice works hard, and that the fine lady with
her round of social duties and tiring gaiety is
subject to a tax on body and mind that the
happy peasant knows nothing of, and that the
cares of statesmanship involve a toil greater
than anything imposed by pick and shovel, and
the whole remaining bunch of mouldy plati-
tudes that make up the stock-in-trade of the
propertied classes when they go in for deep
philosophy. It is all true, and if it had any--
thing to do with the case it might be interest-
ing, if the world hadn’t yawned over the same
yarn ever since the days of: Tubal Cajn.
Furthermore, it is quite true that the Labour-
party comprises and represents only one class
of labour, and doesn’t profess to have any com
uection with the other classes. It. has nothing
to, dp, with workers simply as workers,,
whether, they work with mind or muscle.
If the Duke of : Argyll were to start a. coal-,
mine in his back-yard, give his alleged
intellect, a rest, and put in 15-hour shifts
with a pick, it wouldn’t agitate the Labour-
party in the leasti The Labour-party is quite
unmoved to learn that a busy barrister con-
siders himself lucky if even Sunday afternoon
gives him an hour or two of leisure, and that
the enthusiasm of some literary man or artistic
fanatic won’t let him leave his work from dawn
till midnight. The question whether a man
works for “ monetary reward ” or not seems to
Faustine to be, in some way, an element in the
case. It is as immaterial to the Labour-party
as the colour of his socks. If an individual
chooses to break stones all day long because he
enjoys the occupation, or because he wants


exercise, or because he doesn’t know how else
to fill in his time, he doesn’t become a social
problem at all, and social reformers are no more
concerned about him than if he spent his
allotted slice of eternity in playing marbles, or
tootling “God Save the Queen” on a penny -
whistle. Nor would it make any difference if,
instead of stone-breaking, he took to painting
pictures or writing five-act tragedies in blank
verse. Futhermore, the Capitalist is equally
out of the question. It may be the fact that
Jay Gould has a good deal more work to do
than a corporation labourer, and that some of
his work is a good deal dirtier into the bargain.
It may be that he passes toilsome days and
restless nights trying to find good breeding-
ground for his “storages”— (God bless the
Duke of Argyll)—and that, nevertheless, he
has the mortification occasionally of seeing odd
millions lying round unproductive for days at a
stretch. This is very distressing; but the Labour-
party doesn’t get into a state of burning excite-
ment over the grievances of poor J ay Gould.
Individually, no doubt, the members of the
party are no less tender-hearted than other
people, but officially the woes of a millionaire
don’t trouble them.
* * *
Of all the multifarious workers on the earth’s
surface the only class that has any claim on the
attention of the Labour-party is the class of
disinherited and oppressed. The toiler, robbed
of the fruits of his toil; the producer, who sees
his produce gathered into another’s barn ;
the labourer, starving on a meagre crust while
idlers live riotously on the corn and wine and
oil won from the earth by his labour; the
armies of wage-slaves broken on the nether
mill-stone of competition ; the strong arms that
seek work, and waste for want of it, barred
from the world’s great workshop by the flaming
swords of monopoly and greed ; the little
children, whose young lives are offered up in
sacrifice to the modern Moloch ; the gaunt-
eyed women, whose bloodless hands strive
desperately to push back the twin destroyers,
Vice and Famine—these and their lot are the
cause for which the Labour-party is to do battle.
This is the cause of “labour.” His Grace of
Argyll says that “ the common antithesis—
Capital and Labour—is a false antithesis,
a fallacy of the worst kind.” Perhaps he
is right. Perhaps the term, “labour,” is
misapplied. It may be that it does not lay
down with sharp mathematical precision the
exact line that separates a logic-chopping Scotch
peer with a big rent-roll from a starving dock-
band, fighting for the chance of a half-day’s
work at sixpence an hour. It may be that no
word can be found in the English language to
express the distinction. That circumstance
will not trouble the Labour-party much,. It is
not shuffling with vocables that will fool them
into the conviction that there is no difference in
a fight between the uppermost dog and the dog
below. Philological cranks are at liberty to
amuse themselves, trying to fit appropriate
designations to the two classes into which
civilisation has drafted off the human race
those who produce and those who devour, the
oppressors and the oppressed, the spoilers and
the despoiled. Call them what you please, the
Labour-party is for the bottom lot.
A Letter from England.
Deab Bulletin, —I want to indulge in a little
prophecy, all the more so as the influenza is
caging, and presently I mayn’t be above ground
to make it. Everyone I see—l mean all the
leaders of social progress—are dispirited and de-
jected (whatever, of course, they say publicly to
the contrary), alleging that there is a quiet as of
death settling down upon things, and that
nothing will be done” for five years to come,
maybe for ten or even more. The peace of
Europe is, I am told, absolutely secure. “ Never
since the initiation of the Big Armament Theory
has the universal feeling been so decisive against
war.”
# # *
Outwardly all this is true, and my first seven or
eight months’ renewed experience of Europe de-
ipressed me more than I can say. The true issues
seemed totally obscured. Any red : herring was
good enough to draw across the social trail and
throw the democracies off the scent. But more
and more has it been brought home to me that the
masses everywhere are seething in a discontent,
whose savagery has a determination and a purpose
in it utterly different to the blind and dumb and
sullen sulkiness which X knew in them several
years ago before I left England. Coming back
after this interval, I can have no doubt about it.
In London, no less than in Paris, i,t is merely a
question of arms and ammunition. If only the
masses knew how to get rifle and cartridge, there
would be a revolution to-morrow. Hence the
■singular popular craving for a dictator —
somebody who will do what they want and who
will be able, should the time come, to arm the
masses in self-defence. Boulanger got all his sup-
port from the city “ mob ” from the very idea that
he was the man to do this. Here in England they
don’t go so far yet. The workmen are afraid of
dictators as being “ un-English,” and still belieye
they can manage with constitutional agitation.
# # *
Burns,, Tillett and Co. realise that the new
Unionism has been “smashed” and will bo
smashed more and more as Capital organises, and
they’ve taken up the notion of a Labour Party
and legislative revolution as a last resort. Be it
so. Let them try it by all means. That’s what 1
believe in with all my heart as the ultimate thing,
but it will never come here in England without
blood. The Classes will never abdicate of their
own free will. They will have to be pulled down,
not handed down, from their throne, and then,
when they see that the Masses are just as resolved
to enforce their law and order as the Classes have
been to enforce theirs, the rest may accomplish
itself peacefully. It is that great initial wrench
that will have to be gone through first, and I
don’t see how the tooth can be got out without it.
# * *
If it is to be done quietly, constitutionally and
legislatively, it will take 50 years, but the masses
will never consent TO WAIT. Popular education
is acting like a hot-house of Socialism. “What
is the good of living in the days of telegraphs and
trains if you’ve to compel people to use couriers
and coaches ?” That is the idea, and the pressure
brought to bear is already so great that the Tories
have been terrified into giving free education
(more and more of the poison !) in direct violation
of every election-pledge. The bourgeois enthu-
siasm for Booth springs from the same
cause. The middle-class believes that Booth
understands the masses and can “keep things
quiet” with big doses of religious opium, and
tney’ll give him another £120,000 if he shows he
can do it, or anything like it.
# * *
At first I was a little astonished to find that the
chief store of the wholesale bitterness and viru-
lence poured on to me, for having written the
“ Songs of the Army of the Night, ” came
from the Liberal, not the Tory, press. A gentle
reproach for a really quite unjustifiable personal
attack produced the reasons, with a thorough-
going frankness. “Look here, you advocate
violence, and we can’t have it.” I asked:
“ Where do I advocate violence?’ “It doesn’t
matter where; it’s in the 'whole tone of your hook.''
How admirably journalistic to attack me fiercely
on every other possible issue! The truth is that there
is a shuddering dread of anyone giving expression
to the idea which is in so many minds. It is to be
rigorously kept out of literature—and even more,
to be kept out of responsible journalism. Once
again, be it so. As a matter of fact, of course, I
don’t advocate violence, but I do say the effort to
ignore and suppress the singular popular craving
for it will yet prove a failure of incommensur-
able consequences. The younger Tories already
coquette with the dictator idea, though with
infinite caution, because the bourgeoisie, which
used to be solid Liberal, is rapidly becoming
Tory. Imperial socialism, when used in flinging
the middle-class to the wolves, is a terrible risky
game to play, especially when the enfranchise-
ment of the women may yet give the old constitu-
tional Conservatism another immense lease of
power.
* # *
It is this recession of the bourgeoisie which is
the prime cause of the present acute dispiritment
and dejection of the progressionists. Let us look
deeper. The peace of Europe is not secure.
That’s all nonsense. There may be a bolt from
the blue any day, and then what must happen ?
Each nation will have to be armed—the whole
nation, not merely the troops. It was the arming
of the Erench that gave the Communists their
chance in 1871. The pressure, the terrific pressure
put on the Kings by the big armaments and the
wild hope that a foreign war of aggression will
divert attention from social agitation, will pre-
sently precipitate such an Armageddon that there
will be no choice left but to arm the masses all
round. It is a clear ease of the horns of an abso-
lute dilemma, and Europe cannot escape for many
years more from the wildest leap in the dark she
has taken since 1793. The present hush is not the
quiet of death. It is the quiet of life, of frantic
life—the quiet before the storm. Let it begin by
taking what shape it likes. There is only one
shape that it can end in, and that shape is social
revolution. It is not that I advocate violence. It
is not that I believe in violence. It is that I see
that no way will be left out of the rapidly
approaching crisis in Europe but violence.
American Democracy, in her first great hour
of trial, found a man she could trust with the
dogs of war. In her second great hour of
trial she found yet another man she could trust.
In the supreme hour of trial of Democracy
all aver the world, in Europe, in America, in
Australia, will she find her Washingtons and Lin-
colns to win liberty for her and them, having done
so much, to achieve the final gift of gods and men,
and leave liberty with her ? Who would not ad-
vocate a belief in violence, when nothing else
was left, as an alternative to tyranny, if only they
were sure that it would finally produce not a
Julius Csesar, but a Washington .; not a Cromwell,
but a Mazzini > not a Napoleon, but a Lincoln—
not an enslaved Italy, not an enslaved England.,
not an enslaved France, but a free nation, a free
republic, a free world ? This, I feel certain, is to be
the chief problem of the more or less immediate
future here in Europe, but what will be the reso-
lution of that problem, still lies in the will of the
gods.—Always yours truly, Francis Adams,
London, June .7.

necessity for opening 212 cases of new goods, silks,

munity ,'to do its utmosjt to relieve the thousands who
have been left homeless. Many of them are even destitute
of clothing and p,fe unable, owing to the floods, to reach my

ingly low figure of 11s., and coats'being traded off at a
ruinous sacrifice, and it is therefore absolutely essential
to take steps for their relief. Years of incessant toil

ha,ts at Is. each.
Concerning Sewage.
The authorities of Victoria have resolved to go
in for a new and hygienic sewage system, and
they are doing it violently. The old, original
sewage system, when sanitary science was in
its infancy, consisted in letting all offensive
substances, such as bones, grease, and the like,
fall on the floor, and when the stench became
too awful for endurance, man simply packed
up his city under his arm and fled away. Next
some brilliant intellect struck the great idea of
heaving the debris outside the front-door and
leaving it there, and this scheme filled the
human bill till another and a greater mind
invented the ordinary hog, and employed him
to eat up the wreckage. Then some individual
of tremendous mental development conceived a
fresh inspiration, and, under his guidance, the
cast-off property was removed by water-power,
or horse-power, or in a wheelbarrow, and de-
posited on somebody else’s land ; and this plan
remains in force till the present day. The
people of Victoria run four separate sewage-
systems, and put on a lot of unnecessary style
about them, but they are all adaptations of this
grand old device. One consists in heaving
everything into the Yarra and floating it down
into the harbour, and then the rising tide
deposits it on the shore at St. Kilda, or Mor-
dialloc, or Frankston ; and the people there
raise Cain about it, and sadly shovel it back
into the sea, and next day it washes up afresh
somewhpre else. The inhabitants of Bendigo,
on the other hand, have hired a piece of land in
the adjacent shire, and there they buried every-
thing that was objectionable, till the other day,
when the adjacent shire rose in insurrection,
and drove the long procession of ash-carts back
into Bendigo. Some of the other towns have
tried to adopt the sewage-farm system, which
consists in dropping all the mud and decayed
meat and dead cats on a farm under the thin
pretence of promoting fertility; but as each
shire tried to establish its farm in the next
shire, and they found that they were simply
swapping sewage, this latter plan is fast falling
through. Finally the dessicator system turned
up, and all the principal towns adopted it joy-
fully. Each municipality was to erect a build-
ing like an exaggerated brick-kiln, and in this
every obnoxious substance was to be burnt into
impalpable dust. There was to be no smell, no
infection, no germs, no anything. Then the
Fitzroy council promptly arranged to put up its
dessicator in Brunswick ; and the Collingwood
authorities were discovered trying to put up
their dessicator at Heidelberg ; and the people
of Moonee Ponds tried to plant theirs in
Essendon—in fact, every separate township
decided to move all its sewage into the next
township and have it destroyed there; and
every township found out the other township’s
game ; and they all resolved unanimously that
they would see the other one hanged first.
Consequently the new arrangement is moving
very slowly. Whenever two municipal bodies
are gathered together it is safe to bet that each
of them has resolved to build its dessicator in
the other’s territory, and that the other one
won’t stand it, and that both of them have
passed two resolutions —first, that they won’t
have anybody else’s dessicator; and, second,
that the people in the next town are a low,
selfish crowd. Hygiene is a great institution,
but the Victorian description of hygiene is the
worst failure on record. The simple and
feasible idea of shoving all the sewage into
Parliament doesn’t seem to have occurred to
anybody.
A Silent Parliament.
Dear Bulletin —This is the fixed and unalter-
able season when the Australian legislator gets
up from sheer force of habit, and moyes that
“ this House has no confidence in the Govern-
ment.” Then the fountains of the great deep
in which bosh accumulates are broken up, and
the senate talks at large about everything, and
spreads itself loosely about the premises, and
pervades space generally. A no-confidence
debate wanders in a promiscuous way over all
Hie subjects that man ever heard of. In the
course of it the vegetarian member demands
that the world should live on beans, and the
teetotal member demands the instant suppres-
sion of lush ; and there are vague howls and
; rows about loyalty, Australian unity, the want
of a ,ne,w Land Act, the recent strike, the
approximate cause of large blue fires, spiritual-
ism, Australian wines, the alleged murder of a
pigger, and the case of a back-blocks policeman
who lias retired without compensation. Noth-
ing is, ever done about any of these grievances,;
nobody ever listens to any of them 1 ; and there
are.no results of any kind. Each member opens
his little tin pf compressed sentiment and lets
fly with ihe contents, and that is all. There-
fore, 1 would respectively suggest that no-con-
fidenee debates should be absolutely abolished.
No-confidphce motions are reasonable enough,
for no one ever yet constructed a Government
that was likely to arouse confidence in any-
body ; but the debate is quite superfluous. Let
anybody who wants to move in the matter give
a week’s notice, and then let him tell his tale
briefly, and if he can’t do that let him curl it
up, and sit on it privately, and hold his peace.
He has merely to observe in a dozen words : “ I
move that this ’Ouse has no faith in the Guv’-
ment; ” and then the Premier can say “Oh ! ”
and after that a division can be taken, and the
result will be exactly the same as it is now.
Speeches are quite unnecessary in such a case—
in fact, they are almost unnecessary in any case,
and it might be a considerable improvement if
they were suppressed altogether. Then every
member could send in his bill, if he had a bill,
or his motion, if he wanted to move, to the
Speaker ; and that gentleman could publish
them silently in the thrilling pages of Hansard.
After that each legislator could write out his
speech or hire somebody to write it for him, or
he'could do his Amendment on the typewriter,
and they would" be also published; and the
individual who Wanted to create a scene in the
House could print 1 the scene, and the person
who desired to heap denunciations on the reptile
opposite could bang that reptile in big type,
and when everybody had not read them the
amendments and the original motion, and the
rest of it, could be put to the vote without
comment. Under the present system hardly
anybody listens to anybody’s speech except his
own, and as his own speech isn’t listened to
either matters are about level. The orator
talks to the reporters, and after he has sawn
the atmosphere for two hours they simply
announce that “Mr. Smith also spoke.” Half
the House is absent, and of the half that is
present 50 percent, is in the refreshment-room,
and the other 50 per cent, is conversing on
miscellaneous subjects. Consequently, hardly
anybody ever knows what anybody else has
said, except on these occasions when a member
abandons dreary politics, and states that
another member’s mother wasn’t married to his
father, or that the Chairman of Committees is
a bigamist. And if the speeches were printed
instead of spoken hardly anybody would know
anything about them in that case either, so the
results would be just as satisfactory.—Yours as
usual, Titus Salt.
The existence of a Labour-party in any Par-
liament is an expression of a desire on the part
of those whom they represent to alter the legis-
lative enactments that sit heavily on the
necessitous, that give to one class more than it
should justly receive and take from the other,
by taxation, more than it can afford to disburse.
Everyone born into the world becomes heir, or
should become heir, to certain rights, oppor-
tunities, and duties. The right to live is depen-
dent on the opportunity for acquiring the means
of subsistence, the possession of that oppor-
tunity involves the duty of making it possible
for every other human being to have
an equally fair opportunity. Government,
a purely artificial institution, intended origi-
nally to distribute equally these opportunities,
has hitherto in every country, without excep-
tion, legislated towards a monopoly of oppor-
tunities, towards an inequality of conditions,
an inequality in the eyes of the law and a with-
drawal from the earnings of the labourer, by
taxation for the common good, of a sum enor-
mous in proportion to that contributed to the
revenue by the holders of property and vested
interests. Thence have arisen labour agita-
tions, struggles between the classes, between
employers and employes. These struggles have
so far been usually disastrous to Labour,
foreordained to go down in a passive struggle,
fighting not only capitalism but also starvation,
and, moreover, the laws, enforced by property-
owning Governments in the interests of pro-
perty-holders, laws providing penalties for those
who undertake by labour-organisation to evade
certain undesirable conditions and to fraipe for
themselves more desirable ones. Finding this
struggle an impossible one, Labour has, in
certain places, been organised in an attempt to
obtain political power, and has so far succeeded
in New South Wales, that though not yet
strong enough to form a Government ,or to
force a monopolistic Opposition to join the Go-
vernment, it is in a position to sit in judgment
between both parties and obtain, by its domi-
nation of the situation, in return for support,
concessions. If the Labour-party is to be suc-
cessful, however, it must not only act unitedly
and in concert within the House ; but must
continue to hav.e the support and confidence of
those who haye returned it to that House.
The Labour-party haye, very deter-
mined to know nothing of the doings of past
parliaments, haye determined ,to fight for
“ measures not men,'” and to support even their
bitterest enemies for ,a time, trusting thereby
to secure the measures they have been sent in
to obtain. It is with them a pure question of
business: in business, there is neither enmity
nor friendship.
Tile Ist August this year will bp the flOOtji
anniversary of the Swiss Republic. Just six
centuries ago three tiny cantons, forming about
pne-sixth pari of the present Confederation —a
iheije speck on ,the map of Europe—resolved
that they had bad enough of monarchy, “ and
solemnly issued their ultimatum that their
masters might go. 'the impression in those
days was that the new Republic would last only
about seven days, but the centuries have come
and gone, and ,the Alpine states retain their
freedom still, though the monarchies' around
them have had a rough time of it. The Greek
Empire has been chawed up; so have the
duchies of Burgundy, Courland, Lorraine, Brit-
tany, Lithuania, and a lot moie. The Moorish
kingdoms in Spain have been wiped out ; also
the kingdoms of Poland, Servia, Navarre, Han-
over, Naples, Bohemia, and Hungary ; the oli-
garchies of Venice, Novgorod, Florence, Genoa,
Pisa, and several others : and the Tartar states
in Eastern Europe have become extinct, along
with several hundred miscellaneous despotisms
in Germany, Ireland, Italy, and elsewhere.
Turks, 5 Spaniards, Swedes, Franks and Germans
have governed'Europe turn-about, and thebe'has
been riot and frenzy and consternation every-
where. Yet the little, despised Republic has
lasted through it all. It has had no money
worth speaking of, no monarchs, no standing-
army, no silken “bonds,” no pomp of any
kind —it hadn’t even any William Tell, for
he was a delusion and never existed; but it has
got on without them, and when anybody wanted
to conquer it never ceased to struggle for liberty,
♦
Now that the Manipur Blue Book has reached
Australia, it has placed beyond dispute (what
was inferred out here from reading between
the lines of the distorted cables) that no
more shameful episode ever took place in the
long list of bloody and infamous intrigues with
which Britain has won India. There can be no
question that Commissioner Quinton, acting
upon instructions from the Viceroy, laid a
scheme which was as treacherous as any ever
conceived by the wiliest Oriental Despot. Even
the Saturday Review, though necessarily
palliating the proceeding because it was the
administrative act of a Tory Government, is
compelled to admit that it “ had a sort of
OiESAR-BoRGiA flavour about it.” In other
words, this Toriest of journals affixes to the
“ incident ” the damnablest of characters. Of
course, in the perspective the heroism of indivi-
dualism shines brightly ; but men’s bravery and
woman’s endurance cannot hide from view the
central feature of dastardliness. The Manipitri
were an autonomous people, and they had a
right to appoint their own ruler. If they chose
to depose one who had notoriously proved him-
self incapable and to substitute his brother for
him, where, in the name of the Goddess of GaSt
to whom the Englishman bows more devoutly
than he does to the Almighty, was thenecessity
for the interference of Indian Officialdom? No
British interests were endangered, ho British
subjects threatened—only that phantasm of
irretrievable imbecility, “ the prestige of the
Empire ” had to be respected.

T. S. RICHARDSON,
General Manager
[?]
816 Maoquarie-street North, Sydney, July 22, 1801.
My Dear Mooraeinua,—
The socially-interesting feature in the opening of
N.S.W. Parliament on 25th inst. was the visible sulks of
one titled lady over her position in regard to another
titled lady. She (sulkily) wanted to sit facing, instead of
behind, Lady No. 2, and the politician who “boxed” the
orrangeinerii,s (diplomatically, I expect) had about all he
eoukl do to keep her bouncing out of her chair—indeed>
he had to engage her in what must have been a forced
Chat until it was too iate to alter places. Less crowded
(they ware more careful over the adrnitance-cards) and
with not quite 15 minutes of actual ceremony, the open-
ing of the Talking Season was a very bearable outbreak,
and the dressing was good—in instances. Lady Jersey,
attended by Captain “Chumlcy” in scarlet and gold,
wore a dark-grey brocade with floral design in lighter
grey, the bodice having a front of folded grey crtipe and
further trimmed with narrow borderings of grey feathers;
bonnet in black and gold, black veil, and cream satin
gamp, which rather spoilt the ‘ tout,’ to my idea. Lady
Inncs was in a brown gown and fur tippet, with yellow’
bow’s in her hat. Miss Stephen, in maroon. A stylish,
unusual turn-out was of corduroy cloth with basque of
brown fur. Mrs. B. R. Wise, in electric-blue serge and
furs ; the Consul for Persia, in a thrilling cap shaped like
a jelly-bag and made of black astrachan ; and Goschen’s
blue-ftnd-brass get-up was just like that of a gentleman
whom you are advised to apply to “ if you want to know’
the time.”
There are one or two hon. gentlemen of the Upper
House who—despite their courtesy to dames in general—
would' like to make a bonfire of one or two talkative
women who crowd in the seat behind the L.C. bench, I
know;_ At the opening one cherubic-looking councillor
bad a middle-aged magpie chattering in an unin-
terrupted sotto voce all through the proceedings quite
regardless of the manifest fidgets of her victims, who
evidently wanted to listen to the Governor's speech.
The Legislative Council back bench is quite a parade
of martyrs on such occasions. As they come in a
grasping hand is thrust upon any man who has been in-
troduced to any of the ladies behind h : m, and I had a
vague suspicion the other day (from the cold, enquiring
glare and nervous how-do of great men so honoured) that
some of these “pushing” women shook the reluctant
fore-paw of Councillors, whom they only recognised
through the media of Parliamentary “group” photo-
graphs.
Talking about women and Parliament, when the Gover-
nor referred to “Women Suffrage” an amused grin
rippled all over the faces of hon. members, and one or
two indulged in little facetious elbow-nudges. Men never
will take bounding burning feminine ambition au serieux.
I was rather amused, too, at the way some of the front-
row women commented upon the heaven-born legislators
who crowded into the Chamber—not caring in the least
whether their personalities were overheard or not. “ Look
at that one ; he's a labour man,” indicated a fair and pal-
pitating youth in a bag coat, who kept his hands ner-
vously clenched. “Man,” came the audible response;
“hobbledehoy, you mean !” at which a wave of distressed
colour surged up the neck of that possible Hampden-
“lsn’t his hair like Bellew’s ?”—another stage-whisper,
which only produced a flattered smile on the features of a
gentleman with a dash of effective silver in his raven
ringlets. But all the women were only straining their
necks to gaze at the Labour members, who were certainly
the cynosure of the occasion. The only drawback was
that they were so difficult to “spot.” One female who
gazed rapturously at Parkes said that she could tell the
“Labour people ” by Vere de Vere intuition-after which
it was simply beautiful to see her picking out Crick as
Fitzgerald!
Sir Alfred Stephen—a central figure at the opening of
Parliaments attributes his longevity to never having used
cold water—yet he doesn’t rave against the use of it. “1
know two men,” he said, recently, “ one whose bath comes
through the medium of the kettle ; the other who would
break the ice to bathe. Both are equally strong and if
asked to bet on either, I wouldn’t take the risk.” Sir
Alfred Stephen will be 90 on the 20th of August, and a
family gathering will be held, as usual, to signalise the
interesting event.
A well-advertised “ Christian ” writes to a daily paper
to complain of the naughtiness of Sara’s shows—holding
up “ Camille” as a shocking example, to witness which no
well-regulated young girl could possibly take her
mother. But, after all, the whole question of morality
and immorality is decided from the inside, not the out.
The average self-respecting person can witness a hundred
performances of “Camille” without any visible damage
to their moral code; while the other sort of individual
strays off the thorny path at a Sunday-school picnic.
And, by the way, if the virtue of the community is so
jerry-built as- to be endangered by “La dame aux
cameras,” isn’t it rather against the immaculateness of
some of the leading duchesses of local society that they
refused to attend the Bernhardt pr6mi6re because Dumas’
drama filled the bill ? It is only the drunkard who must
shut his .eyes to the wine-shop.
It is owing to Lady Jersey that the stereotyped d.c.
females sit round in freezing silence when Sara is sidling
her acknowledgements to the rapturous applause of the
more independent among the audience. M. E. Jersey
doesn’t clap. Hubby does—with two resonant palms held
on a level with his chin - but Lady J. might just as well be
dozing for all the emotion she displays. Yet, do not
imagine the Jerseys aren’t cordial in public. At a concert
where they were seated (as usual) half a yard from the
forte pedal and close to the performers, when the two
leading artistes came out and negotiated the usual deep
and loyal bob to vice-regality, both Lord and Lady J. half
to# from their chairs and returned the salutation.
Most, women, when you come to think of it, don’t
appreciate the solely poetic aspect of things, and I have
already found that the good lady in the diamond bracelet
and the expensive opera-cloak is most deeply affected by
the persecuted heroine in good plain English, with no
doubt whatever as to what she is crying about. Which
reminds me that I was once out yachting with such a
person, and everybody was gushing over the view in
general—the reflection of the trees in the water, etc. But
she spoke not until somebody said, “Ohl look at the
cabbages 1 ” Then she roused from her over-fed somno-
lence and, gazing round at the landscape, enquired
ecstatically, “Oh, show me, where are the cabbages?’
Don’t you think most women are like that?
Vice-regal “ Cleopatra,” on 36th inst., comprised a large
and gushing house presenting the usual features, even to
the little scrunchy mound of lilies and camelias and green
stuff (with the enterprising florist’s card, twice as large as
the rest of it, hanging out) which fatally ornaments the
O.P. side of the proscenium. Lady Jersey (who looks
plumper every day) wore pearl-coloured silk covered with
black lace and trimmed with jet, a diamond slide in her
too-neatly-arranged coiffure and pretty managerial
flowere in artistic tints. The Jersey girls also had floral
offerings—ditto Lady Darley (in black), who, with Sir
Frederick, accompanied the V.R. party. It was rather
strange to see how eagerly the gubernatorial people—
Lord Jersey worst of all—devoured the book of the words
with the absorbed air of those who cannot otherwise hope
to glean what is going on, and this seemingly open vice-
regal confession of “pas parler Frongsay” will lead to
more leaf-fluttering in the already too stupidly studious
circle. “Cleo.”went well, as usual, from the barge of
the Aspis somniculosa, but it certainly isn’t Sara’s nicest
part, though whatever she does has its own particular
allurement for the person with a good pair of opera-
glasses. To go to see Sara (as many do) without lorg-
nettes is equivalent to trying to eat soup with a tooth-
pick.
Among women the loud, stereotyped gush over Sara is
purely d la mode. They don’t care a rap for the show,
and rivet their glasses to see whether she really has a
double chin or if the forty-five years start out from under
the rouge and whitewash. At “Cleopatra,” as Sara sat
dramatically crouching on the nuptial couch of Antony,
a woman behind me whispered, “Well, they might have
got new bed-hangings for the bedstead.” And I noticed
she was bundled up like a mummy and half-way out when
the asp came on !
Sara dresses “ Frou-Frou ” middling well. Act 1 reveals
her in a lemon-coloured satin, covered with white flimsyi
embroidered on the skirt with single marguerites—a
pretty, girlish gown. In Act 2, her toilet, though hand-
some, failed in the first duty of any get-up, which is, to
become the wearer, and the pinky and crimson tints Sara
sported were just the very ones to be avoided by any lady
with —hem ! —a carroty coiffure. The narrow train and
back of bodice were of art-red plush ; the gown of pinky
satin, embroidered in jewel design ; “sestos” (that is the
technicality for those girth-like bands which always en-
compass Sara), made rather too wide for general effect, in
dull gold, and sleeves and flounce of chiffon. In this act,
pretty Madame Mea appears in a distinctly-awful array—
a fawn cloth over a scaly material, looking like a riding-
dress gone mad over a suit of chain-armour. Act 3, the
Bernhardt frocking is rather reminiscent of a bottle of
ink spilt in an ash-barrel. The front was of grey brocade,
the narrow-trained polonaise and sleeves of black lace,
“sestos” in greeny-grey jewelled velvet. In Act 4,
though, the draping was simply lovely. A pale-pinky
heliotrope brocade bodice and short train, the front lined
with heliotrope, draped in golden gauze, heavily designed
in gold tinsel. “ Frou-Frou ” was inimitably acted—if
such real art can be called so—and among the many
trophies handed up to Sara was a large basket of native
flora. I regret to say, though, that the indigenous
bouquet had a distinctly flrewood-y effect from the front.
A well-filled, but dingy, “reserved ” portion sat out the
Fddora premiere on Monday, arid the alarming prevalence
of high-tide bodices lent quite a serious air to the
gathering. Myra Kemble, regarded every way, was the
woman best worth looking at in the circle, and she wore a
handsome satin brocade in two tones of grey, trimmed
with bands of darker velvet and deep basque and flounces
of grey chiffon, diamond ornaments and stylish opera-
wrap, in white and silver brocade edged with swansdown.
Maggie Moore, in black and pink, chaperoned Bessie
Rignold, in white empire frock; Carrie Swain wore pink
and diamonds, etc., etc. But “in and out and round
about" were dozens of bogeys—commencing at a party
in brown, with her John L. Sullivan arms draped in pink
chiffon ; and culminating in a red-faced lady, who should
have worn a jewelled corkscrew in her hair.
Sydney Liedertafel concert, on 14th inst., in the Cen-
tennial Hall was harkened to by a crowd of very nicely-
frocked people and a small tan-coloured tyke (does he live
in the Town Hall ?—I have seen him there ere this) which
paid marked attention and never raised a yelp, though
some of the singers might have raised a spirit of emula-
tion in his hairy breast. The feature of the evening was
the warbling of Madame Phillips, who had previously
sung at Government House, and I must say that her
\yell-trained lilt is best heard in a smaller room than the
big Town Hall, which her voice was not strong enough to
fill. Those close up enjoyed her florid rendition of the
well-worn “Sing, Sweet Bird,” which was loudly encored
by the people in front. The Liedertafel sang well, as
usual—the “ Frog ” cantata being received with laughter
by several musical spirits, whereat the numerous solemn
section which thinks it isn’t proper to “ lafl” at a concert
exchanged horrified side-looks. Mr. Prouse also assisted
the society, which is to be congratulated on the success of
the programme.
An educational lady is at present roamingaboutN.S.W.
attached to a long and gushing testimonial from a Vic-
torian ex-Premier, in which he expresses his delight at
“Tommy’s” progress in the rule of three, and Maria’s
ditto at something else. Now, considering the vicissi-
tudes of the average “character,” I am sure that both
Tommy and Maria—well known in Victorian society—
would much rather pa had alluded to them in a much
more general way.
Speaking of references, a blonde and voluble angel, with
Potter hair, turned up in response to an ad. for a music-
governess at a rather distant suburban mansion the other
day, and among her gilt-edged credentials was one pur-
porting to be signed by a certain bachelor statesman.
Under the hazy circumstances, the chatelaine didn’t go
into the thing, but simply bowed the artistic applicant
out.
The wedding of Major 11. C. Dane, the gifted American
lecturer, to Miss Jeannie Cook, third daughter of Mr.
“ Sam.” Cook, general manager of S.M. Hkrald, took
place at the residence of the bride’s parents, “ Frank-
fort,” Marrickville, on 16th inst., in the presence of a
large wedding-party, including the acting consul for
America and Mrs. Cameron. The tying-up took place
under a spreading fig-tree in the garden (it is probable,
by the way, that the first marriage ever made was man-
aged under the same conditions) before a pretty floral
altar, and, as the weather was fine, the novel ceremony
was quite successful. The bride wore a simple gown of
white silk and lace, trimmed with lilies of the valley, the
bridegroom’s gifts being the diamond star which held the
veil and the beautiful bridal posy. Two maids (Miss
Annie and Miss Mabel Cook) in cream and gold, with
pearl and gold bangles (the bridegroom’s gifts). Tas-
manian and Melbourne honeymoon, upon which the bride
set forth in a brown gown nicely braided, felt hat en
mite.
After all, my recent attempt to bring customers to the
Sydney Blind School has brought down upon me the dis-
pleasure of an Adelaide correspondent, who avers that
the S.A. sightless section are underselling the seeing
basket-makers by charging low rates and working for low
wages. The S.A. industrial blind have just secured the
tender for Government coal-baSkets because of their
sound, cheap work, and consequently the two-eyed
basket-makers accuse me of “’holding the wrong end of
the stick ” in encouraging people to indulge in blind
basket-ware. It has been pointed out to me that it is un-
just to make any special section of the community—such
as ordinary basket-makers—bear the burden, which
should fall upon the community as a whole, of supporting
the blind, and this contention seems eminently reason-
able.
Sy'dney Suburban Bicycle Ball, at “Nithsdale,” on 14th
inst., was one of the jolliest dances of the season, for
everybody knew everyone else, and a preponderance of
gentlemen made programme-filling brisk work. Most of
the dresses were pretty. Mrs. W. Kerr (jun.) wore black,
the front embroidered in sunflowers ; Miss Brasch was in
a poetic toilet of maize-silk and chiffon, cluster of violets
on the right shoulder. Two sisters in white silk with
“ Dorothy ” trains looked very nice. The supper-table
was draped in crimson cloth with the letters “5.8.0.” in
camellias, the centrepieces showing a pretty mingling of
wattle-blossom and jonquils, violets and snowdrops. Mr.
A. Solomon looked after everybody in a übiquitous
manner, with Mr. E. Yeend as his able supporter. The
programme was embellished by'a trio of cyclists breaking
the record in a leafy lane.
Mr. and Mrs. C. B. Payne, of Glenburnie, Waverley,
gave a most successful ball on 16th inst., to which 153
guests were invited. The grounds were brilliant with
fairy lamps, and floor and music delightful. Dresses also
satisfactory'. Mrs. C. B. Payne, in black velvet and
diamonds; the Misses Payne in yellow liberty silk and
eau-de-nil brocade and tulle respectively ; Miss Dransfleld
in scarlet silk covered with black gauze spangled in gold—
her sister in pale-blue ; Mrs. Woodin in cream brocade
and chiffon trimmed with jewelled lace and jewelled
butterflies; Miss Taylor in heliotrope and gold with
bouquet of voilets. Among those present were Dr.
Collins, Mrs. S. A. Fullford, Dr. Edwards, Dr. Jamieson,
Mr. T. Barlow, &o.
They are saying just now that it really isn’t always very
nice to be the first lodgers in a just-finished hotel. One
of the first occupants (a lady) was lazying au lit the other
morning wdien in walked a man and woman, who coolly
marched about inspecting the fittings, etc., and retired
without the briefest apology' to the lady, who was too
astonished to do more than watch their cool progress
with her mouth open. They were “ doing ” the establish-
ment, of course, and paraded in wherever the handle
would turn. Moral: lock the door.
Brisbane goes one better than the overdone hoydenish
barn-dance—the stereotyped riot of Sydney ball-rooms
this season, in which the bounding beauty usually ends
up with her back hair in her teeth and a face like a ripe
radish. Myra Kemble (returned from a lavishly vice-
regal patronised run up North) told me that Lady
M'llwraith asked her p rmission to have the “Kangaroo”
dance at one of her balls, and the thing was quite a hit.
At first only four ladies and gentlemen, dressed in red,
hopped through it, but the attraction was irresistible,
and the whole company joined in.
The President of the Australian Club (Mr. Merewether)
will shortly issue cards for a ball to “warm ” the new and
palatial Club buildings at the corner of Macquarie and
Bent Streets—the finest club site, perhaps, in the whole
world. But the new club-house spoils it.
Yours affectionately,

One more effort to “save the sugar
industry ” is being made in Bananaland. The
Colonial Sugar Co. has leased a big estate near
Mackay to small farmers for five years, at 5s. per
acre per annum for cultivated land, and Is. per
acre per annum for bush lands. Tenants rushed
at these liberal terms, and the company was
enabled to pick its lot. The small farms are to
work in conjunction with Central Mills. This is
the first honest endeavour to elevate the sugar-
industry to a “ white ” undertaking, with neither
pap from the Government, nor Papuans from the
islands, nor pappous Italians. Other estates are
following the lead of the 0. S. Co.
How nicely Parkes is trying to humbug
the Labour-party over the shearers’ fracas ! He
(who formerly, when it suited him, boasted that
he would allow no one, not even the Treasurer, to
interferein thecommand of the military and police)
now announces that Inspector-Gen. Fosbery must
ac.ept the whole responsibility of dealing with the
labour question; but Mr. Horkins, the dema-
gogue, says he read on Parkes’ table a minute in
his handwriting authorising the removal of a
P.M. to a western town where a labour trouble is
impending. By the way, who is Minister of
•Justice—Gould or Parkes? Then, asked to sign
a petition to the Queensland Executive praying
for the release of the gaoled labour-conspirators', the
wily Parkes said to Horkins, the spokesman of the
deputation, “ Hi never sign petitions ; but if you
get Mr. M‘Millan and Mr. Bruce Smith to sign
this petition Hi will sign it.” In other words,
“ Hi will sign it if you get pigs to fly and cats to
take to the water.”

It has leaked out that certain members of
Sydney’s jeunesse dorte have been “ supering ” for
Sara, the serpentine, in “Cleopatra.” In order
that these potentates may enjoy the fame they
have so well earned, we may say that several
limbs of the law, including Mr, Ernest Lamb,
and the lengthy Mr. Cockshott, and, it is said, an
individual responsible for a controversy lately
raging concerning the educational tendencies of
French plays, were assisted by Messieurs Adet,
Bulteau (ex-University lecturer), Sauerwein,
Ullmo and A. Gl. Wise, to wrestle with the
togas, brass breast-plates and tights of “Cleo-
patra’s ” tableaux. If Sara may not go to Potts’
Point, Potts’ Point most certainly may go to Sara.
** * *
“ Frou Frou,” so far as Sara is considered,
is high art, very high, in fact, Bern—hardt; leav-
ing Sara out of the question, however, there is no
other performer deserving of special praise or
blame. Mme. Meais graceful, sweet and womanly,
but lacks finish in moments of special difficulty,
and is at all times dwarfed by contact with the
enchantress. The Brigard of Munie is played
more vigorously than we are accustomed to ; his
giddy irresponsible father is not a worn-out rake,
but a breezy life and laughter-loving voluptuary.
Duquesne’sSartorys is somewhat after the method
of Titheradge’s, quiet and intense, while the
Valreas of Fleury is a mental and physical wreck.
As for Gilberte, the character has never previously
been properly handled throughout in Australia.
From first to last, in moments of wantonness, of
anger, of affection, of remorse, she was the highly-
strung, dainty, incomplete product of unhealthy
environments. Sara’s physical fitness to play
Gilberte to some extent incapacitates her from
faithfully depicting Jeanne d’Arc, the muscular,
bony, hard-handed, superstitious Boadicea of a
primitive life. But her magnificent declamation
makes even the most critical forget, while under it;,
witchery, that this part, or any part, is not suited
to her methods, her style, or physical development.
Nevertheless, the Bernhardt is too complex, too
lacking in quiet, weight, and breadth, to im-
personate accurately the slow-moving, simple
peasant enthusiast. (This is blasphemy!) To
see Sara has been a liberal education, in French,
to Sydney audiences, who have, bar those who bend
over their books, already learned to follow her
closely enough to laugh and applaud at the right
time. Sara, it is said, can die in fifty different
ways. So far, we have seen her die of consump-
tion, concussion, poison, snake-bite, heart-disease,
and by conflagration. In “Pauline Blanchard,”
written by Mons. Darmont, which was last night
(Wednesday) to be played for the first time on
any stage, she dies, after cutting her husband’s
head off with a sickle, of madness, but with “a
beautiful smile on her face.”
The Bernhardt Sydney season’s receipts
have, so far, exceeded considerably those of the
Melbourne run, and it is just as difficult to get a
seat now as at the v opening, in most parts of Her
Majesty’s. Therefore it has been decided to ex-
tend the season, and ns the great fistrion, John
L. Sullivan, opens at this house shortly in
Duncan Harrison’s “ Honest Hearts and Willing.
Hands,” Sara, the serpentine—someone remarks
that she has more chic than most election eggs—
goes to the Royal for nine nights, on July 29,
prior to taking ship for ’Frisco, on Mondavi
August 10.

At Sydney Criterion business, dwindling
down, has been revived by the engagement of the
fighting kangaroo, a highly-trained and intelligent
marsupial, who can’t hit very hard with his fore-
paws, but who dodges blows cleverly and keeps
his head out of harm’s way, and then, resting on
his tail, suddenly puts in his little “one-two ” on
the ribs with his hind feet. “ Jack ” is a big
draw, but as. he can’t sing his appearance in
“ comic opera ”is rather “off.” Harris has been
again compelled to retire. The Bernhardt com-
pany attend a matinee on Thursday next. There
will be no change at this theatre till “Dr. Bill”
comes along on August 1.

“ Heroes,” by Conway Edwardes, first
produced by Frank Emery, of Sydney city, at
Liverpool Prince of Wales, in ’76, and since
played for one consecutive night at Brisbane by
Essie Jenyns for her benefit, is a particularly
quiet and “talky” comedy, of decent but not
particularly bright dialogue, built up on particu-
larly conventional lines. If it had been in other
respects likely to be popular, however, public in-
terest has been alienated by the Rule Britannia
slush that is ladled out about “ fighting for the
Queen, God bless her,” and the bravery displayed
in the mowing-down of assegai-armed Zulus by
“ heroes ” armed with magazine-rifles. Anything
weaker and more conventional than the conclusion
of the last act can scarcely be imagined. In fact
“ Heroes ” has all the worst points, few of the
good ones pertaining to British comedy, and
doesn’t leave us much foothold to poke fun at the
American playwright. It is played fairly well,
though on first night there was a deal of fluffing,
owing to lack of sufficient rehearsal. Cautley, as
the scapegrace who wins the Victorian Gross,

lopks lovely in kilts, but hasn’t much chance of
showing them off ; Edwin Kelly is acceptably
emotional as the grandfather who is also a
Major-General and a Knight; “Teddy”
Royce, “Charlie” Brown and Hans Phillips
struggle manfully with parts that don’t
fit them, the Misses Kingsley and Knight as
love-lorn maidens do wonders with the lachrymose
matter they have to handle, and Mrs. Walter

the author had “ glory,” on the brain. “ Heroes ”
will run, weather permitting, till August Ist,

Alf. Wyburd finds himself compelled to
close the Bondi Aquarium while building opera-
tions are going on, and in these straits has been
generously offered the use of Coogee for the pur-
poses of a benefit, by his friendly rival, Mr. Lar-
iriour. The Coogee masked and fancy ball is
likely to create a sensation.

At Sydney Royal business in the “ pop’kr
parts ” has been consistently good throughout the
SV eek, and “Flying from Justice” will run until
it is compelled to fly from Sara, who opens in the
Oastlereagh-street house on July 29, the return of
the Opera Company having been deferred for
nine nights.

Melbourne shows were not injuriously
affected by the Great Flood. It is true that
many unfortunates had to escape from destruc-
tion on rafts and float into places of safety on
bread-pans or kitchen-tables when they might
have been seated high and dry in an amphitheatre,
but the deluge washed both ways, so to speak.
Red-faced gentlemen up for the races were dis-
gusted to find their anticipated festival turned
into a fish-pond, and as the betting-market was
inundated, and the “quotations” some four feet
under water, they sought more recreation than
usual at the play.

Considering that “The County Fair”
winds up with a wild rush of racecourse and
cardboard palings past four deluded steeds, whose
endeavours to get there deserve a better fate, the
uncrowded condition of the Opera House has
been somewhat surprising. Perhaps the turf
world doubts the integrity of those three losing
jockeys who allow Cold Molasses to be pulled first
past the post by an underground cable, or jerked
home by a windlass, without entering a protest
forthwith. Maybe, too, the experts can’t reconcile
a mechanical neck-and-neck struggle with Tim the
Tanner’s announcement that the County Fair
prize will fall to the horse that makes the best
time, whilst the absence of speculation on the
event, and the want of interest displayed by all
who ought to be most concerned, are probably
regarded as unsatisfactory details. Anyway, the
race-scene doesn’t seem realistic enough to con-
vince a city which has only just recovered from
Dr. Carver and the Alexandra tank. Otherwise,
“ The County Fair ”is all head and no tale. The
first act, despite its rough, nightgowned con-
clusion, looks promising. Abigail Prue, reading
Taggs’ letter of introduction to the young
people, or luring on the weather-beaten
scarecrow who never tells his love, is as
genuine a character as that same bag of
breeches himself. Frank Currier and Miss Sadie
Stringham become favourites directly they appear
on the stage, but as time goes on the play crumbles
under their feet, leaving them nowhere in particu-
lar at curtain-fall. The pretty corn-husking scene
is not a faithful picture of rural life in America,
or any other country, and its domestic interest is
confined to a couple of dumb animals, which stare
at the harvest in a reproachful sort of way when
somebody volunteers a rorty comic song. Gazing
stedfastly at Miss Prue’s cow, one can notice a
silent tear trickle down its nose. “ Have they
brought me to see ‘Evangeline’?” the animal
appears to be muttering to itself, and the cud of
reflection tastes bitter. Some minor changes have
been made from the Sydney cast of characters.
George Carey is a very satisfactory Hammerhead,
and Robert Watson now turns up as Tim. Miss
Ada Dow plays Sally very naturally at times,
Owen Harris is a pleasant young farmer, and
Jennie Lee gives importance to the part of Taggs,
without making a big success in it. She is too
much of a robust Minnie Palmer in the delineation
of the vagabond maiden. The two Yankee prin-
cipals share all the honours with Cold Molasses.

Dampier closes a long season at the
Alexandra after Saturday (25th), and will
presently tour the provinces whilst the big house
(cleaned and touched up) is devoted to Italian
opera. One consecutive performance of “ A Royal
Pardon’’will enable the old favourite to make a
parting flare-up in five different characters, after
which he will doubtless favour his adherents with
a little speech stating his intention to return anon,
bringing his sheaves with him. It should be
worth anyone’s while to go and hear the boys
whistle on this national occasion. Meantime the
Alexandra is doing fair business with “Jess,” a
well-mounted but obfuscated affair in which Lily
Dampier displays a distinct turn for tragedy. In
a general way, however, “Jess ” is about as full of
human interest as Pain’s Fireworks, and the plot
is as unsatisfactory as a dust-storm.

The revival of old friends at Melbourne
Bijou is serving a good purpose all round.
‘‘ Diplomacy,” which held the fort during flood
time, was excellently played except in the trifling
particular of trousers, and a double bill of “In
Honour Bound ” and “Turned Up ” drew an over-
flowing congregation last Friday night. This
performance was in aid of the flood fund, and as
Brough and Boucicault’s generosity was assisted
by the gratuitous services of the entire staff of the
theatre, fore and aft, a cheque for £2lO resulted.
Sophia,” with the “house full” boards hung
out again, emerged from a long retirement on
Saturday. People always take kindly to
Buchanan’s savoury hash of the first great English
novel, and the sufferings of poor Tom Jones, when
he tries to earn an honest living and can’t do it,
provoke much misguided sympathy. As a matter
of fact, Thomas is the sickest type of hero
known to the modern stage. He would dis-
grace a meeting of unemployed, and the insane
devotion of fair Sophia to this able-bodied
sniveller is a strong argument against Jimmy
Munro’s proposal to give women a property vote.
But no matter. Cecil Ward, Titheradge, Law-
rence, Cathcart, Corlesse, and other artists of tire
sterner sex take up their original characters where
they dropped them last time, while Boucicault’s
Squire Western is more consistent in his dialect
than of yore. Of the ladies, Miss Homer, Pattie
Browne, and Mrs. Brough are good again. Miss
Temple is a very nice Sophia in moderation, and
Miss Spong gets as near to the character of Molly
as her face, figure, and experience permit.
“ Dandy Dick ” will be mercifully preserved from
Anson’s bolus on Saturday next (25th).

Meanwhile the course of Gaiety Burlesque
runs smooth up at the Princess’. “The Bogie
Man,” more of a novelty here than it will be in
Sydney, has become a popular favourite, although
the manner of his dragging in is clumsy, and the
background business far less effective than might
be. Opinions differ regai-ding the humour of four
men, representing Parkes, Gillies, Deakin and
Speight, as a corps de lallet (which is the latest
attempt at local colouring), but Fred. Leslie’s
song, “’Ave a glass along o’ me," threatens to
give a fillip to the liquor traffic of this bright and
soddened land. With the public rolling up as at
present, it sounds like flat blasphemy to remark
that a good deal of “ Ruy Bias ’’ is foolish stuff.
If folks like it there is no reason why they
shouldn’t ’ave a glass, so long as they avoid
delirium tremens, and don’t get ruinously mashed
on the colossal charmers who stand around and
smile an intoxicating invitation to come and see
’em again soon.

The Bourke-street halls are doing well at
this Steeplechase season ; also, the Waxworks has
added a very suitable attraction in the shape of a
hairless horse. At the Town Hall, young Ernest
Hutcheson, who completed his 20th year on Mon-
day, has been giving a couple of concerts, and
Hamilton Clarke took a farewell ben. on Tuesday.
The Halhs start their farewell season on the 25th,
and, seeing how they have toned down the
severity of their first Melbourne ideas on the
classical-music question, there is no doubt that
The Lady and her Knight will do fine business, if
the word business be permissible in such a superior
connection.

Melbourne Royal, beautified and made
thoroughly sweet, re-opens its historic doors on
Saturday. Jones’ said-to-be-great play, “ The
Dancing Girl,” will introduce Miss Laura Yilliers
in the name-part, supported by a company whose
names sound strange to the Australian ear. All
will be new inside the house, including Brunton’s
act-drop.

Circumstances prevented The Bulletin
from giving G. Ireland’s benefit an advance notice
in last issue. The veteran was to have his after-
noon out at the Opera House, on Wednesday, and
it may be taken for granted that the fine enter-
tainment offered was attended by as many people
as could push inside, and patronised by a lot who
were content to stop outside and give a little
assistance to a good cause for the sake of auld
lang syne. Many worse actors than Ireland have
enjoyed far better luck in their profession,

At Melbourne Athenseum a notable artist
is giving a series of performances this week. John
Roberts is not a tragedian, but as a billiard-player
be has been before the public ever since feara
Bernhardt became famous, and he is not a bit less
divinely gifted in his own line of business.

It seems, after all, that the Firm-not only
possess a large interest in the Bernhardt engage-
ment, but that Williamson, who was the originator
of Madame’s tour, has had the laying down of its
lines and the control of household matters
throughout. The terms offered to Abbey and
Grau, being necessarily tempting, left the local
management with a risk of dropping money over
the French season, besides the further risk of a
considerable indirect loss by the withdrawal of
their own comic opera people, who were playing
to lucrative business at the Princess’ when
Madame arrived. In point of fact there was at
the outset far less probability of Abbey and Grau
being heavy losers over their share in the trans-
action than of Williamson and Garner having to
whistle for a profit on theirs. Something more
than a success was required before the home
Government could sing hosannah, a remark which
applies equally to Madame Bernhardt. She,
indeed, stands on velvet all the time, but the exact
depth of its pile is determined by treasury
receipts. Her genius has made those receipts a
source of comfort to all the interested parties, yet
even genius wants backing up with smart business
management. The public owe a double debt of
gratitude to the Firm in connection with Bern-
hardt’s visit. In the first place, Williamson
arranged it, and in the second place he took care
to provide plenty of fiddlers to drown the groans
of sufferers, and keep things fairly cheerful
between acts.

Bland Holt, always on the alert for new
dramas of the sensational type, has produced
Charlie Taylor’s “Never Despair,” at Adelaide
Royal, for the first time in Australia. The
mounting, as usual, bears the Holt trade-mark of
perfection, and although the drama itself can lay
no claim to special commendation, the acting pulls
it through. Bland plays a broken-down Irish
tutor from Erin with a penchant for intoxicants;
Walter Howe, as usual, poses as the persecuted
hero; and, strange as it may seem, Albert
Norman, for once |n a way, personifies virtue,
Walter Baker being cast as the destroyer of peace
and happiness, with the aid of W. H. Seagrave,
Augustus Glover poses as a common policeman,
whose promotion in “ the foorce ” is certainly not
rapid, for during the progress of the prologue and
the drama, extending over 15 years, he remains
in the same menial position. Harry Roberts and
Harry Norman, in smaller characters, do good
work. Of the ladies, Mrs. Holt has to bear the
agonies of the wronged heroine; Kate Bishop
appears as a tender-hearted nun, and Virginia
Vivienne has a rather uncomfortable part.
Johnny Sheridan introduces “Bridget O’Brien,
Esquire,” to the Adelaide public shortly. Tommy
Hudson, with fresh talent, still crowds Garner’s
Rooms. The Halffis have been occupying the
Town Hall.

Martin Simonsen protests that his wife—
vonderful voman ! has secured a splendid
Italian Opera Company, but is paying too much
money, The crowd headed by Lamrini and
Oiuti were bought, upder exceptional ciroum-
stances, as cheap as chips. For instance, the two
artists mentioned had already made their little
pile, and came out on easy terms, previous to
settling down to calm domestic life under an
Italian sky. Madame Fannie hasn’t succeeded
in picking up any such bargains, but if her new
goods are the right quality, she will find the old
shop as well patronised as it was five years ago.
Sixty-four consecutive performances, with the
house generally chock-full, was the first Alexandra
season.

Thus the N.S.W. Presbyterian: —“ Perhaps the saddest
feature in the Sara Bernhardt mania that is now in ful*
swing in Sydney is the appearance of so many literary
men flunkeying at her skirts, eager for the smallest
crumb of recognition, as dog for a bone, and fearful lest
the most commonplace remark that falls from her lips
should escape them—and the public completely befooled
by Sara's glamor and led like babies in her apron strings.
Alas! alas 1 ” And this reminds The Bulletin of the
story which Sara tells of a certain religious editor of
Sydney who But never mind. We are not mean
enough to stir up jealousy between a clergyman, however
giddy, and his good old trusting wife.
A London cable states that Miss Florence Saville (Mrs-
Max Rown) has been a great success at a private recitah
at which her songs were accompanied by Sir Arthur
Sullivan. The latter fact alone would argue in advance
Miss Saville’s success. It is said that Lord and Lady
Carrington have done much to create English interest in
the accomplished and pretty' vocalist.
If the new Juvenile Opera Troupe is to be the training
school for any more incipient “stars,”it might as wel*
train them a little taller than Flora Graupner and Violet
Yarley, both of whom are Pollardites. The “small and
early’’sort of leading lady is not entirely satisfactory.
We want them medium-sized, if possible. Neither amazons
nor marionettes. The former are seldom able to dance
gracefully, and the latter—nevare.
Touching a paragraph in a recent number of The
Bulletin —the setting of Divine Sara’s dressing-room is
one of the Firm’s expenses in an ordinary way. They had
a luxurious retreat set apart at Melbourne Princess’ when
Mr. Abbey asked permission to take over one of the
chorus-rooms for the “star,” and furnish it on his own
account. W. and G. didn’t reckon on the lady wanting a
square acre of ground to herself, but immediately laid
themselves out to satisfy her regal requirements in other
cities. Sara’s gracious smile, when she’s satisfied, is worth
all the money.
Little Props furnishes us with an essay on the Trium-
virate, and there are some droll pickings in it. He likes
James Cassius, as decent a fellow as a manager can be.
Garner was the man of mystery, always rushing out of
the office in a short coat, adapted to sitting on a high
stool, and with a pen behind his ear. Muzzy was the man
everyone liked—Oh, they just loved him.
The infatuated management of the Melbourne Royal is
apparently going to retain the vestibule bars—relics of the
goldfields era, when people went to the play to booze,
with the legitimate for a mere side-show. At none of the
other Melbourne theatres are patrons of the stalls, upper-
circle, and gallery, compelled to pass through bars. Such
a thing alone is enough to give the theatre a lower stamp.
“ Some time since,” writes our London correspondent,
“ I told you there was a split in the Lyceum camp, and
that the immortal Ellen and Henry had fallen out. Of
course it was denied at headquarters, but the fact remains
that since that time they have not played together,
Henry having put up the “Corsican Brothers,” while
Ellen has stuck to the part of Nance Oldfield. Rumour
had it that the tragedian has a rival in the affections of
the tragedy Queen. Of course this is a libel. It is some-
what singular that the announcement has just been made
that Miss Terry’s health will not permit of her playing for
some time, and this in theatrical circles is expected to be
followed by her retirement from the Lyceum, I hear
that certain influential friends are trying to heal the
breach, but so far without success.
Young Henry Irving has definitely decided to adopt
the stage as a profession. It is announced in London
D.T. that he is to start his career at the Garrick under
the aegis of Mr. John Hare. The part selected for his
debut is that of Lord Beaufoy in “School.” Hare’s son,
Gilbert, will appear in the same play, as Krux. Macintosh
will be the Beau Farintosh, which used to be one of John
Hare’s finest parts. The actor-manager will not himself
take part in the revival. Of course young Irving will be
boomed by Clement Scott and other friendly critics, and
he may achieve a kind of succes d’estime on his father’s
account, but it is not at present anticipated that he will
rise above mediocrity in the profession which his father
so adorns. Ho has all the elder Irving’s worst mannerisms
apparently without his ability. Our correspondent saw
him play at Oxford, where he was a fellow-student of
several Australians, but he failed to impress outsiders.
He possesses abundance of confidence, however, and,
under such a tutor as Mr. Hare, may succeed. Irving,
jun.’s, brother also goes on the stage.
On one of Bernhardt’s Adelaide nights, the Register
representative, a full-blown University professor hired for
the season, dropped his notes—very voluminous—with a
loud crash into the stalls. What if they had struck
somebody?
There has been a final burst-up at London Savoy (writes
our correspondent) as far as Nellie Stewart is concerned.
That lovely and capricious creature has all along managed
to put herself in the wrong with the management,
whether from vanity or “ sheer cussedness” 1 cannot say
—probably a little of each. Having engaged to play the
leading lady’s part in Dance and Solomon’s opera, she
struck because there was not enough “fat” for her.
After some trouble, she relented and began rehearsals.
All went well till the second act was tried, and then she
found that Jessie Bond had, in her opinion, been too well
looked after, and there was another strike. Her demands
and objections became at last so irksome that D’Oyley
Carte became disgusted and at once gave the part to an
American aspirant, Miss Snyder, who promises well. The
Savoy much regret Nellie’s secession, as she shaped so
well. Her sprightliness and vivacity struck them all, and
a big hit was predicted. There is just a suspicion that
Musgrove wants to get back to Australia, for he has not
been much of a boom here, and that it is really he who
has made all the trouble, in order that Nellie may not be
a fixture in London.
The great want in London is original dramatic work
and revivals are the order of the day. The latter remark
applies also to nearly all Australian theatres at the pre-
sent time. Budding Australian dramatists should under-
stand that to succeed, the local colouring must be either
eliminated or relegated to a secondary place. Human
passions and feelings upon which all dramas must be
founded are common to all countries. This is where many
have failed—but Haddon Chambers avoided the mistake.
According to latest advices (writes a correspondent)
Ibsenism would seem to be finally dead. The author fails*
for with every chance he has failed utterly to attract the
public from want of constructive skill. Most of the talk
about the morality of his plays was unmitigated bosh. A
man may teach on the stage what morality he pleases, but
in order to succeed it is absolutely necessary that he
should possess sufficient ability to interest his audience.
This is what Sardou always does—lbsen, rarely or never.
“ Formosa,” which created an uproar in London when
first produced 22 years ago, is accepted now at Drury
Lane without a murmur. “ The Dancing Girl ” and other
plays are educating them slowly.
J. C. Lambert, the comedian, in the days of the old
Melbourne post-office, when you had to “crane’’your
neck at the pigeon-hole to buy stamps, once presented
himself at the “hole” and asked for “a twopenny-
thrippenny-fourpenny-fipenhy-sixpenny stamp” all in
one breath. “What do you want?” said the clerk, as
he brought his eye to the hole. “ I want,” said Lambert
very humbly, “ a penny stamp.”
Haddon Chambers, when the mail left, was busy at
Westgate-on-sea with his new play for Tom Thorne, to be
produced at the Vaudeville before Christmas. “Haddon,”
says a correspondent, “ is now well up in the stirrups.
He fairly snorts at the idea of joining the Savage Club.
Nothing but the Garrick will suit him.”
Lucia Harwood recently played Mrs. Linden in a
matinee performance of “ A Doll’s House,” and Referee
“Oarados” says she was the success of the show. The
same writer, by the way, declares that Janet Achurch is
the only perfect Nora he has seen.
David Christie Murray figures as part librettist of a new
comic opera, “The Dunmow Flitch,” to be produced in
London shortly. Murray’s comic style always struck us
forcibly. It was so thundering heavy.
" I’m in great request at ie.veys— l mean levees," sayt
Florence fcevey, the Gaiety danseuie, in " Buy Bias." A
poor little jolfe, whtyh remind* us that it would be really
humorous if spoken by a certain namesake of the damsel’s
who is so morbidly anxious to be known as George Collins
Lev-ey. It also reminds us that girls never dance, or are
even present, at levees outside of Gaiety burlesque. But
where all is idiotic one particular bit of bosh makes no
difference.
Henry Irving actually writes privately to the London
newspapers whenever Royalties visit his theatre asking
them to mention the fact. Is Irving a snob ?oris it that
he only appreciates the snobbery of the British public ?
Such is fame! Pall Mall Gazette writes of the Aus-
tralian Napoleon of the drama as the Honourable George
Collin !
The Princess of Wales was hissed on her last visit to
London Opera and a yell came from the gallery, “What
about the baccarat ? ”
Legislator Hale, of Minnesota, who carried through the
Anti-Ballet law, cannot get over it. When he leaves his
buggy outside they put trousers on his horse, and paper-
trousers on the chicken served up to him at table.
Toole is twice the man he was. Before he left England
it was really feared he would die of grief, so terrible was
his succession of calamities, in the deaths of his son,
daughter, wife, and brother, leaving him absolutely alone
in the world. His friends would not be averse to see him
married.
Bernhardt finds her actors variously estimated in
various cities, wherefore she distributes them in the plays
so that each gets a good show, some compensation for
humble salaries. Ordinary French actors always are
astonished at the English salaries, the French scale being
what the English was a generation back.
The Kendals are back in London after a most successful
American tour. Needless to say they are enchanted with
everything American.
Melba will be here about 1920, A.d.
Ellen Terry says Ibsen is utterly repulsive and un-
natural, and she won’t have anything to do with him.
Kreitmayer, the Waxwork man, has a factory at Abbots-
ford, and it was flooded out. The Prince of Wales came

Looking over the English companies on the road, it is
wonderful how’trashy dramas hold on—foj instance, “ The
Crimes of Paris ” in its seventh year ! Fancy the culture
of actors and actresses going round with the puddle.dam
of this dismal and atrocious muck. They actually get
greyheaded on it, mumbling the lines, from town to town,
like wooden marionettes.
Buzzi, of Simonsen’s former Opera Co., is basso at Mel-

Opera reminiscents.

The divine Sara has visited Rodd Island, Parramatta

there. Wonder if she has ever heard of Australian
hydatids ?
James Smith “did” the whole of the Bernhardt Mel-
bourne season for the Argus. Then he took up the Gaiety
Co., which didn’t necessitate leaving long columns of his-
torical introduction, with French “plums - ’ scattered
through it, at the office on his way to the theatre.
Mrs. Charles Warner appears amongst the names of
many theatrical people who came to see poor “Pen-

P. J. Duggan (Melbourne amateur) is reciting at ’Frisco
Alcazar.
A Sydney lawyer confesses that he goes to theatres
chiefly because he takes legal advice out in free tickets.
The Wiegand recitals in Sydney Town Hall have been
very successful from an artistic point of view. M. Wie-
gand considers the organ, which is the largest, to be also
the finest in the world. Judges consider the new organist
the best on record.
Some of the Sydney “ unco guids ” have been giving
Sara bold advertisement by advising “ professing Christian
people not to attend her shows.” As most of the “ pro-
fessing ” are busy making arrangements to scoot with
trust funds and other fellows’ wives to Honolulu, they
haven’t time to listen.
A series of concerts are now given on Saturday even-

Mr. J. C. Williamson much regrets that, after all, he
will be unable to arrange for Madame Bernhardt’s ap-
pearance at Brisbane, which would involve two exhausting
railway journeys, occupying in all over three days, this
for the purpose of playing for six nights only. It would
cost £360 to shift the baggage alone.
Solomon’s “Nautoh Girl” breaks the Sullivanic spell at

At Sydney Police Court, in Chinese
gambling case. Attorney Lowe (for defence):
“ Your worship knows that recently an Important
Personage was a , acted" as banker in a game of

in the raid on the gambling-shop were a Lands-
office clerk and a bank clerk. Each was taken to
the cells chained to a dirty Chinaman, in whose
company he spent two nights and a day.
With what ill-concealed joy does thewhole
Sydney daily press—morning and evening—hail
what it regards as the beginning of a split by
which the Labour-party will be riven and made ■
impotent! With what fine, but premature,
cynicism will the Argus and Age editors,
on getting the long telegrams sent them
by their Sydney agents, the daily press
aforesaid, proceed to prophesy Donnybrook,
coupled with the name of Andy Kelly? The
I'owdy political meeting on Monday night, held
for the avowed purpose of censuring the Labour-
party for not throwing out the Ministry, was
engineered by a lot of disappointed place-hunters,
secretly egged on by the same soi-disant
“ democratic ’ faction which, without consulting
anyone, nominated A. G. Taylor at West Sydney
in opposition tc the officially-chosen labour man,
and which vainly sought to foist rum-seller
Young on to the electors of West Sydney at the
expense of the proletariat. Writing before the
division, The Bulletin sincerely trusts that,
should Andy Kelly, who has now definitely stated
that he will not vote with his party, adopt that
course, he will, in one act, be fiyed right out of the
Labour ranks, and that the party will deal
similarly and summarily with any and every

No. X.—“ The Ripple of Dene’s Laughter.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A, whitewashed, windowless wall stares
stolidly over a row of pallets. On the other side
of the room are more whitewashed surfaces but
with barred windows relieving one form of ghastli-
ness with another. Between the window-spaces
some wooden cradles miserably creak as they are
rocked by the mothers of their occupants. At
one end hangs a beautifully-drawn text-card, the
work of Chaplain Marsden’s convict-clerk in his
leisure hours, which conveys the Divine command,
“ Suffer little children to come unto me. h rent-
ing this, at the other end of the room, two other
cards seek to animate no less fervently the droop-
ing spirits and feeble piety of the inmates by in-
voking their attention to the ordinances of
religion. In bold, red type, the “ Grace before
meat ” and the “Grace after meat” occupy one
card, and fitly flank the other pasteboard on which
are printed, in lustrous black, the Regulations for
the Factory Maternity Ward. Thus the rules
which provide “ the mercies,” and the forms of
thanksgiving for the more material of same,
are appropriately in company. It was ever the
ease in Old Colonial Days : Law and the System
kept step with Religion—of a, sort.
It is exquisitely clean, this room. Of all the
wards and apartments in the Parramatta Fa,ctory
this is the cleanest —snow-white are the bedding
and coverlets, and the floors and tables glisten
with a brightness almost as pure. It m sym-
bolical, surely, this chastity of colour. Mrs.
Gordon, matron in charge of the lactory, will
tell you “yes but Mrs. Gordon is really not in a
position to speak. Since Martha Cottle, per
Bussorah Merchant (2), that pallid girl—-she is
just out of her teens —sitting on the chair by the
farther cradle, was received into the ward some
four or five months ago, Mrs. Gordon seldom
patronises it with her presence. And as Parson
Marsden commends her for the improved appear-
ance of the “Maternity,” Mrs. Gordon smirks
appreciatively and holds her tongue. Like a true
woman, she is willing to be awarded excep-
tional praise whether she has won it or
not, and, like a wise matron, she will
offer no objection to affairs being sub-
jected to much-needed improvement provided she
is put to no trouble and is unimpeded in her
attempts to add to her income by disposing
privatelv of “ maternity ” luxuries. And Martha
Cottle, young though she is, has an old head
screwed on her shoulders (except where her affec-
tions are concerned), and knows on which side her
bread is buttered. She has stinted, and slaved,
and striven to do justice to Mrs Gordon s con-
fidence in her, and to enable that lady to earn the
good chaplain’s encomiums. She has brought the
ward to a perfection that seems ideal compared
to the state'of the rest of the building. How,
with the mystery of motherhood still lying before
her in her own future, she had done what she had
is a marvel. She had cleansed a filthy and im-
pure dormitory in a physical sense; largely, too,
morally ; that she could not succeed to the same
extent morally as physically was not her fault.
The styes of the System could only be cleansed by
the System.
A mere chit of a girl thrust, merely because she
could read and-write, into authority over women
who were weak fools when they were not drabs
and trulls —what could she do ? her sister-inmates
asked her scornfully, the first night she was left
in charge, as ward-woman. What could she do ?
she had herself echoed in despair, as some of the
viler among them added to the wordy insults
other indignities of blow and gesture. What
could she do, with the new life beating within her
and the tragic gloom which always encompasses
the forsaken and the betrayed burdening every
moment of her existence, wake she or dream she ?
Would it not be the wiser for her to do nothing,
but to simply lie down and die?
She had once thought so. But the new life
bade her live. Though she should not avert from
herself the consequences of her self-murder, she
shrank from the awfuller sin, as she deemed it, of
killing the unborn witness. And so she resolved
to live at least till the new life drew its first
breath of uncelestial air.
Within a month of being appointed wardwoman
she had won over to order and some degree of
decency the occupants of the room. Her patience
and natural intelligence defied their annoyances,
and their craving for sympathy in the direst hour
of womanly necessity which moves even the most
shameless creature of the sex proved her strongest
ally. She and the women had mutual sorrows,
mutual fears.
She had need of them—she told them ; and the
veriest drab of the “3rd class,” Bet King, the
Scalper, told her to “hold up, for when her time
came she’d see to her work, an’ ’ud take care
Mother Gordon didn’t come no priggin’ lay as to
Mattie’s special ’lowances.” The drab was as good
as her word.
When “her time came,” and she had to face
that ordeal amidst the poverty and shame of a
public ward, which is terrible, even amid the
cushions of honour and luxury, the virago of the
Third Class was all tenderness to her, utterly
vixenish to Mrs. Gordon and to every other being
who approached Mattie.
“ Leave her to me, Mother Gordon--”
“ I’ll give you bread an’ water for a month for
insolence!” shouted the Matron, offended at the
impertinent address.
“ ’Tis more’n ye can do, if you were backed up
by a ’hole reg'munt of lobsters ! Leave her to
lne _ an ’ don’t ye come stoppm’ her special
’lowances! If ye do, by ” she paused to swear
a mighty oath—“ if ye rob her of ’arf-a-nounce o’
wine, or a ha’porth o’ tea an’ sugar, Lord ! I’ll
make ye as bald an’ ugly as you’ve made the
Sargent! Now go ’way, and don’t shout here, I
tell ye !”
Mrs. Gordon pocketed the insult, and refrained
from pocketing Martha Cottle’s invalid “allow-
ances.” Her husband, the Sergeant, was an ur.
lovely object when she married him, and her
wifely attentions, which had tended to divest him
of his hair, had rendered him even less agreeable
to the eye. Mrs. Gordon thought it not well to
run the risk of putting a stop to the pleasant
habits of ten years’ standing. For that period
she had been wont to address her spouse as
“ Baldyand she could hardly continue to call
him by that endearing epithet if she were herself
hairless. And Bet the Third-classer had, by
much practice, acquired the deftest method of
robbing an adversary of her hair. Bet claimed
with honest pride the sobriquet of “The
Scalper.”
And because “ Bet the Scalper ” was a profi-
cient in hair-pulling, the Matron was thoughtful
for Martha Cottle’s welfare, and refrained from
absorbing her special rations.
When Mattie got up—Bet kept her in bed
four days after the week permitted by Regulation
—and her boy was placed in her arms, she looked
round to note the condition of the ward. Every-
thing was in apple-pie order.
“You are kind to me, Bet ! A.nd to think it
was you who said you’d kill the child.”
“So I will, if ye don’t take that broth now!
That’s none o’ the cook’s makin’ —I stole the neck
o’ mutton from Mother Gordon’s pantry ”
“Oh, Bet!” Mattie dropped the spoon with
which she was about to taste the savoury mess.
“Well, an’ ‘Oh, Bet!’ ’tis, an’ what then?
Didn’t Mother Gordon prig my wine an’ tea when
I was brought to bed with my brat yonder ? ”
“ But some one ’ll be punished when the meat is
missed ? ”
“Prut, prut! Let her punish me if she dare !
An’ if she punishes cook ’tis only fair, ’cos cook
has of’n prigged inwalid’s speshals, an’ never been
punished. It’ll keep things square if she’s
punished now that she ain’t prigged nothink !

N ow, swaller that broth, Mattie, else I’ll black
your peepers for ye ! ”
# # *
It was quite in accordance with the first
principles of the System that Bet’s demonstrations
of kindliness to the girl-mother proved, in the
long run, the reverse of kind. Inbred in the Sys-
tem was a hatred of everything soft-hearted.
Sooner or later a generous deed or sympathetic
word invited an application of its opposite.
The fourteenth day after Mattie’s infant first
fretted in nurse Bet’s arms, Mattie was sitting
by its cradle, and Bet was “clearing-up,”
when one of the billet-girls, particularly known as
“Mother Gordon’s slavey,” hurried in with a
message.
“Cottle, Matron sez as ’ow you’ve got to get
ward ready for wisitors —Pa’son an’ a gem’man
who wants a nuss for his missus’s new babby !
An’ yer to look slippy, she sez. ”
Cottle was about to stand up when her rude,
self-appointed substitute interposed. “Sit still
there, Mattie ! I’m ward-’ooman, and I’ll show
Old Floggem round. ” As she spoke she pushed
the girl-mother back on the pallet on which she
had been sitting. “Ye ain’t ’arf-strong enough
yet.” And, as the Rev. Samuel Marsden entered
the room, with a fresh-featured gentleman in his
company and the Matron in his train, it was Bet
King who first curtsied to the visitors. She did
not include in the sweep of her salutation the
official woman, you may be sure.
“ Very clean and in good order as usual, I see,
Mrs. Gordon!” approvingly uttered good old
“Floggem.” “And you need have not the
slightest hesitation, Mr. Robertson, in taking any
of the women I indicate for a nurse. Only trust-
worthy women would keep the ward in such
order!”
“ Delightfully clean ! Really, who could have
thought that-ah—criminals would have been so
mindful of the decencies of life, Doctor .
“Yes, ’tis very astonishing, if you consider the
innate depravity of their hearts and the vicious-
ness of their lives before coming under our ,
But, thanks be to God ! we bring ’em to a better
state of practice when they have been with us a
short time, do we not, Mrs. Gordon ?”
“Yes, Pa’son, sir!” modestly answered the
Matron, curtseying. .. . ,
“ They have all the ordinances of religion, ana
plenty of soap and water, and ample time to keep
themselves and their clothing clean. I hen they
have the benefit of rigid discipline. The Regula-
tions are read ?” , , ,
“Yes, Pa’son—they ’as the Reg’lashuns read
over to ’em daily ! ” responded the
“ Leastways, w’en the warder can read !
“ But Cottle’s ward-woman, isn’t she ? And she
reads ? I heard her reading grace one day ! said
the Senior-chaplain.
“Yes, sir, she reads grace w’en^ theres time
but sometimes, Pa’son, there ain’t no time, tor
meals for inwalids is necesser’ly not reg’lar .
“ But, you never omit the Regulations, i hope.
The chaplain was growing stern in voice.
“ No, sir, not of’n, sir, at least!”
“ Now, understand ! —I speak as a magistrate,
Mrs. Gordon, and not as chaplain there must
never be any omission of Regulations! How is
discipline to be preserved? How are the new
women to know what to do, without they are
read constantly ? Do you hear now, Matron .
“ Oh, yes, Mr. Marsden. But ” „
“No ‘ buts,’ Mrs. Gordon. It must be done !
The incorruptible Magistrate, the instrument of
the Law, spoke there ! And then he went on—as
the “ Minister of the Gospel.”
“Are there any infants to christen? Let me
see, ’tis a fortnight since I was here last. How
many since ? ”
“Five, sir!” replied the Matron. “There’s
Cleaver, Bruce ”
“There’s six, Matron!” broke in “ The Scalper.”
“An’ one dead ! ”
Mrs. Gordon counted on her fingers. “ Cleaver
—Bruce —Smith —ha —Harris Cottle’s. Yes,
Mr. Marsden. Six there is, sir—l was forgettin’
of Smith’s-we don’t count the still-born ’uns,
Pa’son ! They don’t go on theratiomsheets.” Mrs.
Gordon spoke falsely here. They did.
“Ah, six! Well, have ’em to Church in an
hour. With their mothers, if possible ! ”
“Some’uns too young to take out, Pa’son !
Two o’ ’em only four days old ! ”
“‘ Mrs. Gordon, why do you allow this woman
to speak ? ”
“ ’Cos I’m actin’ ward-’ooman— that’s why ! ”
retorted Bet before the Matron could reply.
“ Elizabeth King, acting ward-woman, Mrs.
Gordon! What does this mean ? A woman of
her notorious character ! I thought Cottle was
warder ! ”
“ Sir, k’racter is it ? ” screamed Bet. “K’rac-
ter ! By , Parson Marsden, my k’racter
ain’t worth a dump, but your’s is jest worth
a holey dollar without the rim. What does
Mr. Wentworth say ’bout ye? What does Dr.
Douglass say ’bout ye ? ’Kracter! My lights,
Floggem Marsden, the Rum-dealer, to talk o’
’kracter !”
* * *
The issue of this outburst was, of course,
serious. Bet the Scalper was ordered to be
shaved. It taxed the energies of two gaol-barbers
to perform the tonsure, and earned for her a tem-
porary change of epithet. Bet the Scalper was
metamorphised into Bet the Baldy. Which was
poetic justice.
That was the less serious part of the business.
Cottle, having appointed (so Gordon averred) Bet
King to the post of ward-woman without due
authority, was, as a punishment, ordered to be
placed on the “ List of Available Nurses.” Which
was the more serious part. As the Regulations
did not provide fora substitute for a ward-woman
during a ward-woman’s illness, it was obvious that
no ward-woman was expected to be ill, and that
she had no right to fall ill without permission.
This was discipline according to Mr. Marsden.
The reverend gentleman did not pause to reflect
that if the ward-woman was not expected to be
ill she would not have been admitted to the
Maternity Ward. Only women on the eve of
maternity were admitted to that department of
the Factory.
Cottle, we say, was placed in the Nurses’ List,
as a punishment. And Mr. Robertson, Calcutta
and Dutch Merchant, of George-street, Sydney,
whose wife had given birth to a son about the
same date as Martha’s boy was born, having first
choice, elected her to rear his child, Mrs. Robert-
son being too weakly to do so.
# # #
It was a grievous punishment this “list-
ing ” to Martha and to women like her, inas-
much as it meant separation from her own child.
A woman who was permitted to remain in the
Factory might keep her child with her for
months, perhaps years, perhaps altogether.
There was always the chance of assignment to a
kind employer—the odds were against the kind-
ness, but still, they were not overwhelming—or of
marriage, in which case the gentleman, usually
just out of “bond,” who proposed to throw his
handkerchief to a Factory lass, might be
encouraged to woo a woman with a fine, healthy
boy. The boy would prove useful in farm or
garden by-and-bye ! On the other hand, not one
wet-nurse in twenty hired from the Factory was
allowed by the people engaging her to retain her
child.
“You’ll not separate me and my boy, sir,”
Mattie implored. “I’ll do the right thing with
your boy, sir ! —l’ll never wrong him for my own !”
Robertson was really a kind-hearted fellow, and
seeing the girl’s distress, would have consented
had it not been for Gordon. With the true
instinct of the old-time prison official, she now
sought to further oppress the creature she had
wronged. Cottle was in disgrace—was certain to
be removed from the ward in any case, and could
be of no further use, so why should she not pro-
tect the interests of the family who proposed to
engage a nurse from her establishment ? She
remembered that. No penal officer ever could err
by being too zealous.
“They all say that, Mr. Robertson an’ Mr.
Marsden ! They’re not to be trusted, these
’ussies. Your child ’ud grow thin, sir, an’ hers
fat.”
Cattle, wounded to dumbness, could only stare
at the woman. The parson and the employer
took her silence for a sullen acquiescence in the
truth of the Matron’s remark.
“No, I’m afraid not,' my good woman ! ” said
the merchant, after a moment’s hesitation. “ I’m
a f raid Mrs. Robertson would object ! ”
Then the girl found her voice and pleaded so
piteously that Mr. Robertson at last consented to
permit her to take her boy with her to Sydney to
ascertain Mrs. Robertson’s decision.
# # M
“No, I cannot consent!” said that
querulous lady, as her child’s nurse pleaded her
own cause and that of her child. “One infant is
as much as a delicate young thing like you can
manage, and I cannot have my boy neglected for
yours.”
“ Please—please, ma’am, do not separate Dene
and me ?”
“ Dene !” in tones in which weakness blended
into surprise. “Dene! what a name to give a
convict’s love-child. Why did you not christen
him a sin pie name—John or James ?”
The girl made no answer, save that red flags of
shame coloured her cheek, and for a tighter pres-
sing of the babe to her breast.
“Speak, girl, can’t you? Why did you give
the brat so grand a name? Why, my boy’s is
only a plain Thomas ! I suppose it was his
father’s name ?”
The shame-flags flaunted the more vividly in
Mattie’s face. Still, she did not speak.
“That settles it!” said Mrs. Robertson. “I
won’t have a child with a name like that in my
house. I will let you keep him just a fortnight,
and then you must take him back to the factory,
or I will get Mr. Robertson to have him sent to
the King’s Orphan School.”
With this meed of grace, Martha Cottle, per
Bussorah Merchant (2) had perforce to be content.
At the end of a fortnight, being granted a day’s
holiday for the purpose, she took passage by Mrs.
Walker’s caravan for Parramatta, to return
her boy, then about a month old, into the keeping
of the good angels of the Factory. With her on
the trip she took also her foster-child. Sickly,
pampered Mrs. Robertson would only consent to
the holiday on that condition. “She could not
be bothered with baby that day,” she said.
In the maternity dormitory, where she was only
admitted as a great privilege by Mrs. Gordon
after the particulars—“ Name, parentage and
place of birth, form of features, colour of eyes and
hair, height, previous convictions,” and “general
remarks,” relating to the child, had been duly
recorded by the receiving-clerk—she was wel-
comed with delight. The occupants of the ward,
though they were not the same by one-half as
those she had left, were profuse in their testi-
monies that things had changed for the worst
since her departure.
“ Mother Gordon ” was robbing more than
ever, and the meals were irregular, and Parson
was doing no christenings, and, in short, disorder
reigned. “There was nobody like you, Miss,”
said one poor wretch of a Second-classer, who had
been sentenced for three months merely “to get
her trouble over,” “ an’, o’course, they’ve taken
Bet from here since she’s been shaved !”

gathered round her when the lady last spoken of
entered, or rather rushed, into the room, and up
to Martha, whom she hugged with characteristic
impetuosity.
“Oh, Mattie, ye wretch, to think of yer cornin’
here, an’ they wouldn’t let me see ye ! I heard
from the gate people that ye were ’ere, an’ so if I
get cells 1 made up to come from the laundry to
see ye. I knows as I’ll get a week’s cells, but I
don’t care, an’ so I told Mother Gordon. An’ the
room’s a-goin’ all to dirt agen, ain’t it, Mattie?
An’ I’ll—an’, oh—these are the kiddies, then, are
they ? Oh ! an’ ain’t they like ! Which is which,
Mattie ? Why, they’s as like as two peas !”
Whilst she was speaking she took the infants in
her coarse, soap-suddy arms and held them up.
And then Cottle noticed for the first time that the
children resembled one another, even more closely
than one baby of a month’s age usually does
another of the like duration of existence. With
the same eyes of blue, the same contour of head,
and the same dimpled flabbiness of cheek, the
infants might have passed for twins.
•J ust then the Matron, with the solitary soldier
kept at the Factory to awe the more turbulent
spirits among its sisterhood, arrived for the pur-
pose of removing Bet, who had most insubor-
dinately broken regulations by leaving one divi-
sion of the institution for another without
authority. The Baldy—alas ! no longer The
Scalper—had barely time to whisper “Change
’em, Mattie, change ’em —keep your own, an’
leave the other here,” when the hand of the “ lob-
ster ” laid hold of her brawny shoulder. “All
right, Mother Gordon,” the notorious third-
classer said. “I told ye I’d see Mattie, an’ I
’av’ ! Now- cell me if ye like, old ’ooman, an’
double cell me for that—an’ that!”
Bet, on principle, had no objection to “cells,”
or a double or even treble dose, and as “That!”
and “ That!” signified respectively a pulling off
of Mrs. Gordon’s cap, and a slapping of that
worthy lady’s rubicund visage, it was exceedingly
likely that Bet’s principles in that respect would
be subjected to no severe strain. Such strain as
was exerted was upon her body as the official and
the sentinel hauled her rigid form from the ward.
As she was disappearing through the doorway, she
stopped her escort short, while she called out.
“Don't ye forget, Mattie, wot I said! An’
good-bye? ’
# * #
The devil seldom appeared to poor, dis-
traught mortal in a more ill-favoured aspect than
he did to Martha Cottle. For only the devil
could have inspired Bet King when she coined that
hideous suggestion. Nevertheless, the lack of
charm in the Bald One’s person did not prevent
her words from sinking villainously deep into
Mattie’s nature.
The girl-mother first revolted from the idea —
re considered it—dismissed it once more—and
then, with great nervous tremblings of heart and
flutterings of brain, embraced it.
In her position as ward-woman she had neces-
sarily been acquainted with the disposition of the
Factory buildings. To change the dress of the
infants without being observed was essential, and
she recollected that there was an ante-room to the
dead-house opening on the passage through which
she would have to pass to the dormitory where
the motherless, and worse than motherless, infants
were tended. Thither with the idea burning
its irresistible fascination into her consciousness,
she passed, as soon as she had bidden a hasty
farewell to the other wretched beings on whom,
in common with herself, the divinest of all gifts
had fallen amid the most degrading of sur-
roundings.
In the ante-chamber of the room used for
the mortuary, she undressed her mistress’ child,
and her own. And upon her own—the fruit of
sin and shame and sorrow, she put the cambric
and the lace of the offspring of the wealthy ; and
upon the latter she put the coarse swaddling
clothes which constituted the chief part of the
layette provided, in its exceeding generosity, by the
System, for the branded children of its children.
She never knew how she performed that hatefulest,
sweetest of tasks. Her fingers were nerveless —
yet they unhooked the tiny garments, and un-
fastened pins ! Her eyes were dim with the cloud
of countless fears—yet she saw how to adjust
ribbon and pin ! She held her breath, as though
Nature would not countenance her in her supreme
treachery—yet, when the deed had been done, she
Was breathing as though a distressful fate had
bade her scale a crag burdened with fardels. But,
however, it was done once—aye, and for always.
She left the child in the Infants’ ward. “ Dene
Cottle, No. 32—75,” was its number and —name.
And no one suspected ?
None certainly in authority at the Factory ;
hone at Mr. Robertson’s house —not even the
mother,
* * *
Cottle won her way into the Robertson’s
good wishes by her all-absorbing care for their —
her—boy.
“ Do you not want to go and see your baby,
Martha ? ” questioned Mrs. Robertson three
months after that visit to Parramatta.
“My baby, ma’am,” was her startled response ;
“ Oh, no ! I can’t, ma’am! I couldn’t bear it! ”
Perhaps it was natural (thought her mistress),
after all, that the mother, whose child by harsh
circumstances had been torn from her, should
refuse to have the wound re-opened _ by the
touch of the baby’s fingers, which might not
always cling to hers. And so the lady, who
was not cruel but only selfish and a lover
of her own ease, did not press the point.
She was prepared to grant her nurse an occa-
sional day’s holiday “on pass,” and to pay her
fare to and from Parramatta; but not to grant
her permission to bring back the child and keep
it with her. That would have been an act of
condescension altogether beyond the average
employer. If she had only known !
* * •
The boy, “ Tommy Robertson,” grew
apace. No child had so patient, so tender a
nurse, thought the Robertsons; never nurse who
“took so” to a foster-offspring. And when
Tommy was followed by a sister and a brother as
the years rolled on, Martha Cottle, instead of
being re-sent to the Factory or re-assigned, was
retained under engagement to the merchant’s
family. Gradually, the transport assumed more
and more an indispensable position to her em-
ployers, and when, after five years’ service, she
became entitled to her ticket-of-leave, they were
loth to part with her.
“Mattie’s got her ticket, I hear, Sophy?” the
merchant said one day. “ I don’t think we should
let her go, though, of course, she will cost us over
twenty pounds a year more !”
“She will be worth it, Robertson,” his spouse
rejoined,” I can’t do without her ! After being
used to her and she to me, to have another
assigned girl, p’r’aps a dozen in succession, will be
more than I can bear. Look at her fondness for
the children, too ! Why she positively worships
Tommy—he might be her own, she’s that fond of
him !”
■ “Well, well, Sophy, have your own way! I
might easily lose what we will have to pay her in
wages in the time necessary to prosecute the
hussies we’d have to follow her. Riddell was
telling me the other day they have not a decent
girl on the books now !”
And so the chatter of husband and wife was
as the hammers of Fate on the coffin of their son.
Mattie was not separated from her boy as she had
feared. Desperate plans she had formed, indeed,
to steal away with him
when once she had re-
ceived the indulgence of
the “ticket,” and to leave
a note behind her dis-
closing the fraud. There
was no need now to put
the plans into execution.
She was to stay with her
boy—to see him grow up
into goodliness of health
and figure and brightness
of intellect. Once see
him started fairly in the
race of life, well, what
cared she then for her-
self ? She might tell him
some day ; or, she might
not. She might tell the
Robertsons, or she might
not. As to these
ticulars, circumstances
should decide. And as to
that most terrible of all,
the doing of justice to
the Robertson’s child,
some day, she would do
that if, in the doing, she
did not injure too much
her own boy. She
hugged her secret closely.
# * *
Her secret —which,
after all, was not a secret
at all.
One day, about Tommy
Robertson’s and the other
changeling’s third birth-
day, Nurse Cottle had
the boy and a younger
infant with her on the
Racecourse. A figure in
the semblance of a
woman lifted itself from
the grass as she ap-
proached the Chapel end
with her charges.
Bleary-eyed and blouzy,
the thing was marked
with all the characteris-
tics of the drunken
woman-transport. It was
Bet King—out tempor-
arily from the Factory—
in a free interval between
two spells of gaol,
“ Oh, Lor’, ’tis Mattie!
Give us a tizzie,
Mattie, for old times ! My coppers are fryin’ for
a lush 1 What!”—as the affrighted Cottle drew
away _“ What, forgot an old friend ? An’ I never
troubled ye all these years ! an’ I might ha’blown.
I didn't think it o’ ye, Mattie ! An’ I might ha
blown, an’ I didn’t! ” Then, she shed a tear or
two.
The word “blown ” chilled Martha almost to a
StE “ Blown !” she gasped, in her trepidation,
“ What have you to blow about ?”
The maudlin humour of the vixen changed.
“ Well, if that ’tain’t good, now ! Not blow ’bout
nothin’ ?” Steadying herself and putting all the
impressiveness possible into her gesture, she
stretched a finger to the elder child.
“ Whose child is that ?” she demanded.
Scarcely knowing what she said in her fright,
Martha pulled the boy closer to her and shud-
dered out, “ Why do you ask ?”
“ ’Cos he’s yours !”
“ God, how do you know ?”
“ ’Cos I know ye’ve never been to see the one
ye left at the Fact’ry. No mother—even a ,
could stay away an’ never ax-much less ye,
Mattie ! That’s one reason why—an’ then there’s
11 What, what!" shrieked the half-mad nurse.
“ What do you mean?”
“jr was in the dead-house that day! iheyd
locked me in with a stiff ’un as punishment, an’
through the peep-hole I seed ye change ’em ! An’
now give us a tizzy, Mattie—l won’t blow ! ”
* * *
That was the first of many “ tizzies ”—-
single sixpences, and sixpences that multiplied
into shillings and dollars and crowns. Bet kept
the secret when incarcerated, but “ outside ”
which to do her justice was seldom !—she was not
above being bribed into silence.
She did not look upon the monetary payments
as a consideration to hold her tongue, but for the
news she bought of “ Dene Cottle’s ” progress and
welfare —or such progress as an Orphan schoolboy
could make, and such welfare as he could enjoy.
Once or twice a year she brought this intelligence.
“He’s sech a pretty larf ! I ’erd him one day
when I was over to help with the laundry I ha’
to help frequent—though they do say as I’m not
worth rashuns now. He’s a reg’lar leader ’mong
the boys. An’ he larfs out sudden an’ merry it’s
like th’ ripple o’ the river Wharf ’bove the Stnd,
near Bolton Abbey. I was born in the dale !”
and then Bet grew maudlin.
* * *
The child with the laughter like a brook’s
ripple haunted Cottle. She would wake o’ nights
and hear it in eerie fancy, though she never heard
it in reality—not till the time we tell of. “Dene’s
laughter ” —the laughter of the boy who was known
by the name of her betrayer, who had betrayed
her into sin first and then into crime—the name
which was never to be breathed by her to the boy
who truly bore it —rang in her ears, now in merri-
ment, now in derisive accusation. She wondered
whether she ever dare hear it ?
# * *
She did not dare.' Yet she heard it.
The years, prosperous to her and her boy,
mounted up and up till they counted seventeen
from —that day. And at Sydney College her boy
was in the senior forms, winning honours for Ins
reputed parents and himself, and for the mother
who could not claim him. He was affectionate to
her —the love of the child merged into the regard
of the youth, less fervent but the more enduring,
though he grew restive under her kiss now. She
was only his nurse, after all. His nurse !
# * *
Seventeen years—and one day he did not

go straight to school, but with other lads truanted
for the space of an hour to visit Darlinghurst.
In the crowd opposite the gruesome black thing
that stretched from the massive gate fifteen feet
along the wall, he saw his nurse, Cottle. She
was in company with a disreputable -looking
woman who was sober and silent, but appeared as
though insobriety and unruliness were her natural
conditions. This woman held Cottle by the arm.
Bet King had called that morning at Mr. Robert-
son’s house and had told Martha that she’d have
to go to the hanging with her. She would take
no refusal; and dx’eading a scene, the neat-dressed
domestic joined the throng in the company of the
drab.
“Ye shall see what ye shall see, Mattie. I
brought ye ’ere for a pu’pose.”
* * *
A gang of four bushrangers, Cottle had
not heard their names, executions were so common,
were to be “ turned off ” that morning. One was a
mere lad—an Orphan School boy, who had broken
from his assigned master, and joined, in the
bravado of his recklessness, the “ readers.” New
South Wales justice always liked to hang boys.
The youthful mind is so sensitive to sound object
lessons —and youthful necks are so easily dis-
located.
* * #
With craven faces and faltering steps
three—the seniors—are led out of the great gates
and mount the ladder with assistance. The boy
follows, and runs up gaily—swings into a step or
two of a hornpipe—flings forth his hand in gay
salute to the massed people—and laughs merrily
as he bids them good morning.
The boy in the crowd takes his eye from the
boy on the black platform—he is being pinioned
now, but hark ! he is laughing still!—and some-
thing impels him to look at his Nurse.
She has turned, glares into Bet King’s face. She
looks the question she cannot ask.
Bet nods: “That’s him! Don’t ye hear the
ripple of his larf’ter?—Dene’s larf’ter !”
The boy wonders to see his nurse fling her arms
wildly—and goes towards her. He wonders the
more as she murmurs in her unconsciousness :
“The ripple of Dene’s laughter. Oh, God! the
ripple of Dene’s laughter ! ”
PRICE WARUNG.
“ Another Saved Sinner ” writes :—“ Dear
Bulletin,— l was surprised in your issue of last
week to read the letter which appeared from the
young Sydney native, who had such a narrow
escape from drowning at Toorak during the floods
last Sunday. I say surprised, because I had a
very similar experience myself, and the pre-con-
ditions in my case were almost precisely similar
with his. I, too, had only about 12 months ago
been induced to go in for swimming, of which I
was then entirely ignorant, and under pressure
from a friend I was persuaded to attend the baths
at the Natatorium, in Pitt-street. At first it was
not much pleasure to me to paddle about, but
gradually as I picked up confidence, I was able
to venture into deep water, till after six months I
had become able to get along so well that I could
easily swim two or three times up and down the
baths. A few months ago I came over here [the
letter is written from Melbourne. — Ed. B.] and I
continued my aquatic studies at St. Kilda, with
the result that 1 have now become quite a don at
it. However, as I was going to say, on Sunday
last I had an opportunity of testing the value of
my accomplishment pretty severely. I was at
Footscray (not toney Toorak) on this occasion,
paying a visit, and as you may be aware, this is
not the most desirable locality even in ordinary wet
weather. On this particular Sunday, just after
dusk, as I was making my way back from my
friend’s house, I had to cross a kind of big drain
on the flat, in which the water had risen so much
since my arrival that it had become quite a young
stream and was running knots. However, I tried
to cross by a kind of plank-bridge which I came
by, but I found, when half-way over, that the
current had washed away the embankment and
my weight caused the plank to give way and
throw me into the water. Before I could recover
myself I was being rapidly carried down to the
Saltwater River, and then began a struggle which
I shall not forget hurriedly. It was nearly
too much for me, but, thanks to the train-
ing I had received at the Natatorium, I
at last managed to get to terra firma again, and
am able to address you. May I offer a little
advice to all who have never learned to swim :
Commence at once.” —In reference to the sugges-
tion of our correspondent, it may be stated
that at the present time special arrangements
have been made by the Sydney Bathing Company
to make the Natatorium Baths attractive to their
patrons by keeping the water at a temperature of
about 90 degrees, so that swimming may be in-
dulged in even at this period of the year. The
manager of the baths, which are situated, by the
bye, in Pitt street, near to the Haymarket, in-
forms us that a very large number of pei’sons are
attracted by the novelty of being able to swim in
warm water.
RHEUMATISM versus MICROBE
KILLER.
294 Castleresgh-street, June 25, 1891.
Hadam’s Microbe Killer Co., Gentlemen, —For
forty years I have been a sufferer from rheu-
matism, and latterly in the most aggravated form,
often having acute attacks which made me almost
helpless for days, insomuch that it was with the
greatest pain and difficulty that I could move
about at all, and only able to get up stairs on my
hands and knees. A friend who had tried the
“Microbe Killer” with beneficial results sent me
a jar of the medicine, which I took, and I have
now taken three jars of “Microbe Killer” and
the result has been a great wonder to myself and
my friends, for now I can get about freely, with-
out pain. Igo up and down stairs without any
trouble, and I am greatly improved in health
every way. In fact my suffering from rheumatism
seems a thing of the past, and I can recommend
the “ Microbe Killer ” to anyone with confidence,
knowing what it has done for' me. Several have
tried your medicine on my recommendation for
other diseases —and one a cancer patient—with
the same beneficial results.—Yours respectfully,
MRS. WHITAKER.

The S.A. papers describe L. M. Davidson,
the Adelaide saint who eloped with his wife’s
sister and suicided with her at Colombo, as a
“ handsome and persuasive young fellow with a
polished exterior.” As a matter of fact Davidson
was far from good-looking. He had a repulsive
forehead, and very large ears, and when he
laughed his under-lip would stick out about an
inch. Davidson had about the biggest front in
Australia. He used to go to the head of a mer-
cantile house and ask for an “ad.” or an order,
and in the same breath request a personal loan.
Nearly ever tailor in Adelaide was “let in” for
clothing—clothes being Davidson’s chief weakness.
This bright youth, the scapegrace of his family,
was well known in Melbourne at Exhibition time,
and had played the same games in China and
Canada. He was the son of a well-to-do London
banker, and had expectations.

Apropos a last week’s par. on recent
events that have made Colombo notorious. It
was at Colombo also that the doctor of a certain
mail-steamer was left behind when the vessel
continued her trip to Australia, taking in his
place an elderly party who wanted a move down
south. Such an extreme step had the generally-
desired effect of taming a leading danseuse for the
rest of the voyage. It was jolly and hot while it
lasted, until “ respectable” voyagers began to speak,
and then it was made very hot for one. The
other danced the season through, bearing her great
“ sorrow ” bravelv.

so enamoured of all they have seen since they have
been in London, that they have decided to pitch
their tent in England for some years ; but

That vulgar institution, the “ surprise
party,” must go. Some of Sydney’s Eastern
suburbs have lately suffered from the “ surprise ”
visitations of a gang headed by a blatant person
who calls himself a commercial traveller. At one
of these vulgar affairs, the “surprised ’’was very
much astonished indeed as fully nine tenths of the
invading crew, including the leader, were totally
unknown to them. Early in the evening it was
discovered that guests had annexed some jewellery
belonging to the house, which resulted in the
whole lot being fired out and the police sent for.
The principle that a man’s house is his castle is
not an extinct one. All surprise-parties should be
promptly thrown out.

A certain drapery-firm in Brisbane does
business on the cash system—money down or no
goods. This principle has been rigidly adhered to
ab initio. Some time ago, however, the cast-iron
rule trembled for a moment in the balance. It
happened thus : Her ladyship, the then Governor’s
better-half, sent the vice-regal orderly to obtain
certain goods. Asked for the money, he replied
“Oh, book them to Lady .” What was the
shopman to do ? Neither of the principals was in,
and to refuse gubernatorial custom might be
serious. Anyway, he concluded the firm could
stand it, so he informed the semi-military-looking
flunkey that “When Lady sent along the
money she could have the goods,” The semi-
military &c., &c., looked sick, but he had to go
and returned with the money. Which latter
item, we may explain, was more due to the fact
that her ladyship couldn’t get the stuff anywhere
else than to any anxiety on her part to 'uphold
that palladium of British commerce- cash on the
nail.

Lady Hopetoun is evidently antipathetic
(new word) to the vice-regal cattle-pen at th e
theatre—and who can blame her? At the
Princess’, of late, she usually patronises J. C.
Williamson’s own box, where she can keep her
lovely back turned to her Toorak subjects, and
scratch her eyebrow if necessary without sending
a thrill of excitement through fifty large bare
bosoms. People haven’t yet become acclimatised
j new idGR) however, and a good many of
them don’t recognise the Governoress and party
in this comparative seclusion. Which accounted
for the sacrilegious spectacle of a chappie actually
trying to mash Lady Hopetoun the other night.
I rom his stall beneath, this miserable pretender
wasted the evening in mad attempts to catch
the eye of her whom he thought to be
an ordinary flesh-and-blood female of superior
birth. It reminded one of the rash Lon-
doner who once winked at the Queen and was
struck by lightning some years later; also of the
other man, who looked so hard at the Princess of
Wales that he was subsequently run over by an
omnibus and found a watery grave. A merciful
Providence kept Lady Hopetoun unconscious of
the attentions of the goggle-eyed monster below,
or it might have gone hard with him. She would
have ordered her suite to drop opera-glasses on
the misguided wretch, and then the police would
have arrested him for insulting behaviour of the
to xir ost 0 st £ ra<^e ’ an d handed him over to Panton,
P.M., for immediate execution. Only the eagle
eye of Hopetoun can stare at the beauteous sun,
and even he mustn’t stare very hard.

All—positively all—the Melbourne scien-
tific authorities declared there could be no more
local floods, while all the unscientific people
declared that they would come just the same, and
in the result a day and a half’s rain whips up as
bad a one as ever. The Anglican Cathedral joy-
bells were ringing on flood-night— no citizens
with any influence to speak of at the Throne of
Grace had been touched. There was never any-
thing more audacious than the utterances of the
Melbourne Royal Society on the flood-question.
Even now the savants contend, like the French
after Waterloo, that the flood is scientifically
wrong.
* # #
Amid the localities of Yarra shore which
suffered most from the flood was the Cremorne
estate, on which a town of Runemup’s shanties
has spawned, where the Oremorne revels used to
be held, under Coppin. Everybody knew the
poor residents would be ousted by a flood, like an
ant-colony under a kettle of boiling water, but
what cares Runemup ?
» * *
Most of the Melbourne flood-yarns are so
truly sad that a funny one deserves to be remem-
bered. The lord of a low-lying manor and
occupier of the only two-storey house on his
estate, refused to retreat before the advancing
waters for economical reasons. The family
would have to go to an hotel, there was the
furniture to be shifted out and in again, so on
the whole he preferred to hank his goods and
chattels upstairs and let them all camp on the top
floor, or roof, if necessary, until the coast was
clear again. He revelled for a few hours in the
thought that the house rested on a good founda-
tion, and it was better to be surrounded by water
than perched on a dry spot where a lot of inter-
fering idiots would come loading up the domicile
with homeless mothers and damp, hungry
children. Then the flood made such a violent
rush on the estate that the beastly tenants of the
surrounding four-roomed villas had to slush out
into the stream and seek shelter under their
landlord’s wing. Most of them had managed to
save a few pet animals and a frying-pan or two,
all of which they dumped down in the midst of
the reigning family. The boss, disgusted to find
himself running a sort of Noah’s Ark, suggested
that his visitors should scream for boats to come
and carry them away, but they fell upon his
bosom and explained that there was nowhere else
to go, and they would be content to put up with
anything he liked to give ’em. They are still
staying with their dear, kind landlord, as likely
as not being all of them stone-broke, poor things '
and unable to pay the rent of their villas if they
vvent back and unable to go back because
the property is a soddened mass of cracks and
ruins.
* * *
The evening papers lost a chance to do
some really fine writing about the scene in the
Melbourne morgue;, when the floods came along
and washed that institution out. It was lust
about dusk—a grey, cold, sodden twilight, and
the sky overhead was as dreary as Parkes’ coun-
tenance when the election-returns came in. Just
outside the front door of the dead-house the
Yarra was rushing madly along, with dogs and
furniture upon its turbid bosom; and the waters
sang a hollow dirge as they went along, and the
unrestful winds sped by, conveying sodden hats
that were borne up by unseen hands, and wailing
a plaintive melody, like the last observation of a
huge cat upon a wall. There were three corpses
lying on three cold and fishy slabs inside the
morgue. They were on their backs, and looking
up gloomily at the roof, as if they were thinking
about something. By-and-bye the water began to
creep in under the door. It had come from
haunts of coot and hern away up in the Gippsland
mountains—come m strange sharps and trebles,
over glistening sand-bars and little shining inlets
and gleaming shallows decked with curious things
come to babble at last on the stomach of the
dead chemist who was waiting to be inquested
through haying rashly taken some of his own
medicine. It could be heard in the darkness as it
clamoured at the door; there were six inches of it
then a foot—then a moment later there was a
yard of it. and more still coming. Next the door
burst with a horrid rending sound—there was a
strange gleaming upon the waste of the great wild
waves the doorway was full of water and frogs
and mud and broken barrels—the corpses started
to float and cavort round the room, and knock
their heads against the wall and bump up
against each other—the policeman in charge
n e( l with a long-drawn wail —there was
slush everywhere—murky gloom—consternation—
hallucination—general riot and destruction —and
the scene closed. The printer will please set this
item up tenderly.

Sundry parsons, even, knocked spots off
their old friend, the Good Samaritan, at Mol-
ine flood-time. We hear of one practical
shepherd who arove a van around his inundated
district, picking up woebegone paddlers and pro-
viding them with a square meal and other neces-
saries at his home. Such cases were exceptional,
of course. Most of the brethren wasted their
Sunday evening in preaching to six old women,
who had just dropped in from round the corner
under an umbrella, when about three thousand of
their fellow creatures were crving aloud for
blankets.

Immediately upon the Floods Relief Fund
opening in Melbourne, people began asking “ how
much will Hopetoun give?” Some, remembering
recent vice-regal liberality guessed “ £2, perhaps
guineas.” Others thought he’d “bleed a fiver in
a e like this.” Others again voted for “£2O,
and only letters of sympathy for the next two
years, no matter what happened.” At the public
meeting His Ex. handed in a cheque for a £lOO,
with 17 guineas from his menials.
The ‘‘great raid on Chinese gamblers” in
Sydney is purely a business move—the adjacent
white traders object to the presence of the
Chows, _ which interferes with their oWn
advocations and has nothing to do w ith
morality. The Chinese could not have been
permitted to openly gamble so long had hot some-
body in authority been receiving “tip.” Why
are the big European gambling institutions of
Sydney, which turn over hundreds of thousands
of pounds annually, permitted to carry on openly
year after year? Tip, of course. Who takes it’
We all pretend not to know.

HIS TROUBLE.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Huddled on the school-house floor —
Winds came whistling’ through the door,
Sending shivers through the blood
Of the victims of the Flood.
Lo, a little family !
Husband, wife, and boy of three ;
Though their wealth had been but small,
They had lost their “little all.”
Husband, who was tall and slim,
Wore some pants too short for him,
(Part of the donated suits)
And a pair of odd-sized boots.
Wife, who had a comely face,
Wore her “ duds ” with greater grace,
Boy had clothes would make you die
Laughing, if you didn’t cry.
Boy played round, as boys will play
On the eve of Judgment Day,
And his parents, all the while,
Sat and saw but could not smile.
Then a visitor came by,
Eyed them with a kindly eye,
Told them courage should be kept
Up—they neither smiled nor wept.
So he took, caressingly,
In his arms the boy of three,
Patted him upon the head,
Tapped his cheek, and softly said ;
“Little man, with eyes of blue,
Tell me quick, and tell me true’
Is there - don’t be ’fraid of me !
Anything you’d like to see ?;’
Then the boy, with eyes so bright,
Whispered with intense delight—
Making of his mouth a bud—
“ Wish thade be anudder Plud.”

The other day three enthusiastic police-
men raided a hotel in a Victorian town on the
ground that the landlord was trading “after
hours.” One of them went in; another stood
sentry at the back-gate; and the third secured
the key of the front-door and locked it on the out-
side, and then waited to collar anybody who came
out by the window. In just about three seconds
there was a horrid clatter of feet in the passage,
and somebody began to tug frantically at the
door-handle. Then an agitated voice prayed
through the keyhole that he would open the door,
and the sentinel chuckled. Next moment a big,
excited man burst through a window, and when
the officer grabbed him he found it was his own
mate flying from the wrath to come. He had
raided the place in due form, and found the
parties drinking inside to be his own inspector
and the local military commander. At that
moment the third officer burst round the corner
with a scared expression on his countenance. He
had seized the police-magistrate and the clergy-
man as they came out of the back-gate, and
dragged them into the light of the corner lamp,
and then he had dropped them with a howl, and
quitted. While they were talking over this mis-
hap a window was opened, and a man looked out
cautiously to see if the coast was clear. It was
the parish priest. The officers left just there.
They felt they had discovered enough prominent
citizens for one night.

Melbourne floods obliterate the Taramung
Fund. Another peg on the rottenness of the
charity system. Talking of the Taramung reminds
us in a roundabout way of the colliery-trade,
which question must be dealt with sternly by the
Labour-party in Parliament. Under the present
system some old sea-going rattletrap or other is
licensed by the marine authorities to carry, say,
300 tons of coal—a thumping cargo for her at the
best of times. But the owners are not satisfied.
Say they to the captain : “We’ll allow you a stiff
commission on all you carry over your load.” Or
perhaps the captain, schooled in the bitter school of
competition, wherein men to get a living for their
families, are forced to walk over the prostrate
bodies of their fellow toilers, of his own motion over-
loads to please the ravenous boss—himself per-
haps a victim of over-competition. Anyhow, the
captain “shoves into her,” say, another 80 tons,
taking his life in his hand, also those of his crew.
Captains shouldn’t do this, of course, but if cap-
tain Brown won’t doit, Captain Jones, who has
been out of work these six months and has kept
the wolf from the door by casual jobs of manual
labour or acting as a wharf-watchman at £1 a
week, will do it—must do it. It is literally true
that no master mariner is obliged to do it —we
have “ freedom of contract ” and every man has
the alternative-of starving. This is not an over-
drawn picture. It is literally true to fact, and its
truth could be established by the evidence of a

It has been estimated that Queen Vic-

worth £32,000 to that charity. Ere she consented

quickly mounted to £40,000. Loyalty, after all,
is not without its advantages. As a show, it can
be made to rival Barnum’s,.and draw far more

The one man has taken a contract to be a husband
to Mrs. Smith, and the other one has contracted
to put up a fence. They have both quitted the
job, one of them leaving the fence unfinished, and
the other leaving Mrs. Smith unfinished. The
second individual probably cleared out owing to
the inclemency of the weather, and the first one
very likely cleared out owing to the inclemency of
Mrs. Smith. And, now, they are both called
upon to return within seven days, and if they fail
to turn up the fence will be re-let, and _Mrs. Smith

“ What a girl like me wants to do, ” said
a London waitress to a customer lately—with our
mind’s ear we can hear her saying it now —“ is to
marry the gov’nor of a place like this. Some girls
waste their time trying to catch a man that gets
his meals here. That’s foolish. It’s best to steer
clear of the customers, except to jolly ’em along a
bit when they’re here eating. The real chance is
at the boss. I’ve got two sisters that married
governors of dining-rooms and are now in charge.
This man here isn’t quite well enough off yet to
suit me, but the business is good and so I’ll have
to take him. Oh, he’ll pop, never fear. They
always do, to the prettiest girl in the shop, and I
suppose I’m about the best looker here. Our
bloke is a bit old and is bald, but he’s nice, and a
girl could do worse than to marry him. I heard
of a good opening down here at a place in Aldgate,
where the boss is a young, handsome chap and the
receipts are great. I was just going in there when
I heard from one of the waitresses that the man
had married three of his girls within five years
and deserted them all, so I made up my mind
that he was too brisk to suit me. I’ll stay here
and catch the old one. He’s a little withered,
but he’s reliable. A little more apple-sauce?
Yes, sir; right away.”
His thin complaint transparent is,
His simple prayer confusing.
Stout, burly gent—we much lament
The chances he is losing.
He might be sticking steadily
To reproductive toiling:
He might be helping readily
To keep his pot a-boiling.
But still he stands ; those podgy hands
He never dreams of soiling.
How can a Prince imperious,
Who calls a Queen his mater,
Go in for labour serious !
(Though trouble may come later)
Enough to grub at toney club,
And exercise —the waiter.
There’s work for us Australians,
And “ rest beneath the wattles,”
Whilst blue-blood bacchanalians
Pour liquor down their throttles.
Though, ere ’tis quaft, they sometimes graft
At opening the bottles.

From message-boy to bosses ;
Poor Tummy’s just dyspeptical
Through thinking of his losses.
The work he needs, ’twixt heavy feeds,
Is backing winning ’osses.

It is amongst the poor gentlefolk of
Sydney that most distress is to be found. A visit
to the Ladies’ Self-help Institute, No. 18 Beale’s-
chambers, will soon convince the unbelieving of
this fact, for here one sees work both plain
and fancy of all descriptions offered for sale —
work done by ladies who are glad to add a few
shillings to their, all too limited incomes. But
notwithstanding that the articles are all exceed-
ingly well made, and the prices are very reason-
able, sales are not made as frequently as could be
wished ; therefore, ladies are urgently requested
to patronise the Institute, and are reminded that
in so doing they will be performing an act of
charity, and will be nothing the poorer for it.

LOADING
SHOT GUN.
|£2.0.0|
ONLY 2 POUNDS
The PEERLESS HAMMERLESS GUN is
our latest offer to the Colonial public and the
most marvellous value we have ever presented
fO A th RAPID' LOADER, CLOSE SHOOTER,
HARD HITTER, and for general utility, equal to
guns costing TEN POUNDS or more. Can only
be bought direct from us r or our authorised
agents. Very finely finished, browned barrel,
and walnut stock, with steel heel-plate, perfect
ejectors, and hammerless action, lateral breech,
no awkward breaking gear, can be loaded
instantaneously, no jamming of cartridges,
never misses or hangs fire. ■
These guns are, WITHOUT DOUBT, the
CHEAPEST and BEST ever sold. We have
obtained control of the market, and as the
supply is limited, request customers to order
early to avoid delay and disappointment.
In order to Insure confidence in these guns
we guarantee to refund the money after a
trial if gun proves unsatisfactory, and
also to pay return carriage ourselves.
These guns could never be sold for double
the amount, if it were not that we wish them
to be a great advertisement for us.
THOUSANDS ARE NOW IN USE IN ENGLAND.
Hammerless guns are fast displacing the old
style, for the reason that the absence of hammers
is safer, offering no obstacle to catch in bush,
&c., to send gun off accidentally, and also
affording a quicker sight, which is verv essen-
tial in snap shooting.
IWELVfc BORB ONLY 'SINGLE BARREL
ONLY.
The cheapest breechloader sold_ heretofore
was at least double the price of this gun, and
we say positively, much inferior.
The barrel and action of the Peerless gun are
of European manufacture and have formerly
been rifle barrels, and of quite as good quality of
metal as the most expensive gun in use, being
manufactured directly under government super-
vision, and only passed after most severe tests.
The boring and chambering have been done
with the one view of hard hitting and close
shooting. So simple and compact is the action,
that we assert it to be almost an impossibility
for them to get out of order.

Barney Allen, a bookmaker gentleman recently
returned from Yurrup, says that “Colonel North is a
a d decent fellow, and we (North and Barney) got on
well together." S i they should. North is ‘ the Nitrate
King,” whilst B.A. is “ the Golden King, and
usually have a fellow feeling towards one another,
lummy, who is next door to a king, also gets on very
well with North, whioh leads us to the conclusion that
Barney and the Heir-Apparent ought to fraternise
without delay. Pity for two such d—-d decent fellows
not to know' one another.

generated slugger is 'picking up a decent living as an
alleged actor, on the supposition that he could whip
creation if he wanted to. Sullivan the hactor certainly
can’t afford to let Sully the slugger get knocked out ot
time in the fourth round, or earlier. His occupation
would be gone. His game is to go on looking as though
he could whip creation in drama for just as long as
c-eation will pay to see him do it.

The sudden activity of the Redfern (Sydney)
police in running-in 27 fantan-playing Ohinkies is a mag-
nificent illustration of the hypocrisy of the law. In
almost every hotel and tobacconists shop in Sydney,
gamblin'' "oes on for more or less heavy staices, and often
on the credit system. The heathen Chinee, on the con-
trary, always gambles with cash, and only loses what he
can "afford, or at least what he has actually got. With
“consultation” notices all round you, with every barbers
clerk giving profound “tips” on sporting eyents, with
•‘totes” on every hand, and with recognised swell
gambling, clubs of mixed Hebrews and Christians, the
majestic law proceeds to run in a few miserable Chinamen,
who anion" 1 themselves indulge in a cash flutter at
pak-a-pu. Since writing this par., the police have made
some amends bv capturing 42 fan-tanners in Lower George-
street, the hulk of whom were whites.

In the last lap of the St. Leonards’ five-mile
champion “bike” race a dog ran across the course and
brought down Edgar, over whom fell Kerr, Clark, Pear-
son and Whatmore. The two latter extricated themselves
from the ruins of men and machines and finished in the
order named ; but the others were stunned, and have all
-sustained fractures-and flesh-wounds, and, in the case of
Clark, it is believed, internal injuries. The winners refuse
the medals, so the race will be run over again. Next
time it is to be hoped that dogs will be left out, for they
brought down six riders in various other races.

The fishermen of Sydney harbour naturally do
not want the harbour closed to net-fishing. Sooner or
later Sydney harbour will have to be closed, as every men
of it is being dragged by a lot of Greeks and Italians, who
clear out the big fish and destroy the spawning-beds, and
leave the little fish rotting on the beaches. They even
fence in the very wharves with mesh-nets! Ere long,
Sydney harbour will contain no fish except those which
come m and go out with the tide. The question is this:
Is the splendid sport which a closed harbour would afford
to thousands of people, young and old, rich and poor,
those who have holidays every day and those who make
holiday but once a week (line-fishing, it may be remarked,
makes no appreciable difference in the fish-supply), worth
considering, as against the small additional fish-supply
gained by exterminating the fish from a splendid natural
preserve and recreation-ground?

The latest gambling game among the “ Johnnies”
as described by a London paper;—You stick a pin, an
ordinary dwaper’s pin, don’t you know, in the wall, about
six feet from the gwound. Then you stand on a mark,
and fire an ordinary soveweign off your thumbnail (as
schoolboys shoot marbles) at the pin. The sovereigns,
missing the pin, fall to the floor, until pwesently some
awfully clevah and steady old chappie knocks the pin
down, when, of course, he weaps the weward of his extwo-
owdinawy aim and dextewity by gathewing in all the
other deah good Johnnies’ soveweigns. It is not as vulgah
as tossing. _

Loudon Referee, speaking of the Melbourne
Cup, ascribes the popularity of racing in Australia to the
fact that it is as much an entertainment for ladies as
a flower-show is in England. Says the Rep. : ‘ With a
little judicious nursing and a rational scale of admission-
charges for reserves where betting was rigorously tabooed
the clientele of British racing might be almost indefinitely
enlarged and worked up to rival colonial proportions of
attendance to population.” This is simply bosh. .The
“ scum of the course ” are too numerous and the British
D’s too corrupt for anyone who knows anything about
the subject to dream of “home” racing ever being
made sweet enough to rank as a sport for the middle-
classes of both sexes. Decent industry is not perceptibly
represented on English racecourses except on purely'
holiday occasions like Derby-day in the South, or Leger
and Northumberland'Plate day’s in the North, where the
percentage of women present is very small. The sport in
general is supported by three classes of loafers—“swells,
bookmakers and “scum,” the former finding all the
money, as they found it for prize-fighting until tne latter
became too dangerous altogether, and my Lord Tom-
noddy’ gave such a detuned blackguardly’ game 1 jest. The
arrano-ements of English racing-clubs seem specially in-
tended to keep solid, sober pleasure-seekers at a dis-
tance, and although the turf has, perhaps, more wealthy,
or fashionable, supporters than ever, the riff-raff con
■ tinue to multiply at such a pace that they will soon
drive away the men who keep horses for pleasure only,
■ and then they will eat up those who are left.
Mr. Mathew Mellor, M.L.A.
SECOND MEMBER FOR GYMPIE, Q.
Mr. Matthew Mellor, M.P., for Gympie,
possesses considerable experience in two ot the
staple supports of Queensland the mining
and pastoral industries and was born m
1839, at Leek, Staffordshire, and educated at a
village called Meerbrook in the same county.
He arrived with his brother in Brisbane in 1868
and commenced farming in the Logan district
which he followed for 2 years. At the end of that
time lie engaged in the timber trade in the same
d ! strict and on Stanley Creek and the Mary River.
In 1867 he settled in .Gympie then a newly pro-
claimed goldfield and in his search for wealth was
most successful. Mr. Mellor is part owner of a
station stocked with 6000 head of cattle in the
district. He has been associated with Gympie
and its institutions since their formation and was
one of the originators of the Gympie Progress
Association. He was one of the members of the
Provisional Board appointed by the Government
for the expenditure of public monies, and was the
first Mayor elected on the formation of the town
into a municipality in 1880. Mr. Mellor was
never defeated for municipal honours but ulti-
mately resigned his seat. He was appointed a
magistrate of the colony in 1874, and was for five
years Chairman of the Widgee Divisional Board.
He was a member of the State School Committee,
and one of the founders of the School of Arts, of
which he is President. He was for some years
president of the" hospital and is now vice-
President of that institution. In 1883 Mr. Mellor
held a seat in the Legislative Assembly as senior
member for the Wide Bay district (now held by
Hon. Horace Tozer, the Colonial Secretary) and in
1888 was returned as the second member for
Gympie. He has been largely associated with
local mining matters and has filled the position of
chairman and director of the North Glanmire
gold mine for 16 years and holds the position
of director in many of the companies. The
North Glanmire mine has paid nearly £BO,OOO in
dividends to date. Last month (May) crushing of
the mine returned 2370 z. : Idwt. of smelled gold
from 93| tons.

FROM SYDNEY TO MELBOURNE
ON BICYCLES.
INCIDENTS BY THE WAY.
Mr, J. Pearson, of King-street Arcade, th e
well-known cycling tourist, after riding over to
Melbourne with his friend, Mr. A. G. Chapman,
relates several adventures they met with on their
long journey :
For four days after leaving Sydney terribly wet
weather was experienced, and many of the water-
courses, which in the summer time are nearly dry,
were swollen so much that they had great diffi-
culty in crossing them.
On one occasion they were compelled to strip
and carry their machines across, the current being
so strong that they were in imminent danger of
being swept away. Although they were for
several days riding in wet clothes no dire results
accrued, as on each evening after retiring they
took the precaution to rub themselves down with
St Jacobs Oil, which Mr. Pearson always carries
with him on his tours, finding it a capital
for stiffness and soreness of the muscles, as wel
as a preventative and cure for painful ailments
induced by cold.
After getting over the dividing range the
weather changed from wet and cold to excessive
heat. On one day especially the thermometer
was quite 98 in the shade.
Numerous snakes were met with on the journey,
passing several coiled up in the middle of the
road. One monster, over six feet long, caused
them some trouble, as in trying to avoid it the
two cyclists collided, the result of which was a
bruised wrist and a swollen ankle, but the applica-
tion of the ever ready St. Jacobs oil prevented any
bad effects. They reached Melbourne safely,
averaging 64 miles per day, and received a great
reception from their brother wheelmen of the
southern capital.
THE POWER OF OBSERVATION.
This well-known faculty is of far greater import-
ance than people generally imagine. It is natural,
but susceptible of a high degree of cultivation,
and the most successful cultivator is generally tc;
be found in the front rank of his profession, no
matter whether he chose that profession for him-
self, or was pitchforked into it in bis salad days
by the irresistible force of circumstances, or by
the chance acquisition of a stepmother with a
glittering eye, a heavy hand, and a firm deter-
mination to do her duty in that state of life into
which she had been called by the requirements of
a small, meek, widower with large aspirations,
and a young but numerous,family. The man who
“ observes ” nearly always gets a 25yd start in the
race, and if he can manage to observe, and at the
same time look as much like a born fool as
possible, it is as good as 50, because he is rarely
supposed to be anything else than a piously-im
clined innocent sort of ass, until he has grasped
the reward of his particular virtue, when it is too
1 ite to talk of putting him
BACK TO SCRATCH,

The gift of observation is pretty generally dis-
tributed, though not evenly. Sailors have a lot of
it, which enables them always to keep one eye on
the wind and the other on the braces.
Soldiers—when they are not Australian—are
spoon-fed machines, whose duty it is to be as
beautiful as pipeclay and a tight fit will let them,
and be potted by Kaffirs, Soudanese, Boers, Mani-
puris, and other black democrats whenever neces-
sity requires it, but to observe nothing that is not
comprised in the orderly-sergeant’s instructions.
Politicians are, perhaps, the wor<-t off of anybody
in respect of the ability to observe the signs of the
times, even when forcibly obtruded on their
notice. In proof whereof it is only necessary to
refer to the existence of a powerful third party in
politics, the advent of which was foreseen with
deadly certainty by everybody except those whose
crass ignorance and selfish folly created it. Still,
some of them are possessed of
EXCEPTIONAL GIFTS
in this direction, and get what doctors call “big-
head ” in consequence, like the Queensland gentle-
man, about whom it was cabled from London the
other day that he had decided to return by the
very first steamer, and put an end, “ all by his-
self,” to the labor troubles in that colony. The
battle-cry of “Themember for the Balonne to the
rescue,” will be a novelty at any rate, and help to
bring into prominence a tract of country in the
“ Never-never which since its discovery by Sir
Thomas Mitchell in 1845 has been remarkable for
nothing in particular except alternate seasons_ of
drought and flood, and the reputation of having
been the scene of the labors of some of the
smartest horse and cattle thieves—indigenous and
imported—ever known to fame. The most
valuable phase of the power to observe the signs
of the times and the shifty dodges of the un-
scrupulous is, however, that which reveals tp its
possessor the where, when, how he can-pur-
chase the best necessaries of life for the least
money, and among them there is none that
demands so much
CARE AND CAUTION
ai that which immedh t ly concerns the illumina-
tion of the home or workshop, the office or the
factory, as the case may be. Bad kerosene has
put thousands of families into mourning, leaky
o-astittings have been the source of numerous un-
pleasant surprises to kindly Christian men and
women, who have been precipitated into another
sphere by the mere accident of the offer of a cigar,
and its subsequent ignition by a match drawn
rapidly along the underneath side of one of
society’s strongest bulwarks. The new illummant
“ Luxene,” which is now forcing itself into daily
use and general recognition by its own virtues
only is not alone more economical than any oilier
source of artificial light, but it is absolutely and
incontestablv safer and pleasanter, and gives a
mire and perfect light that no age, rank, or con-
dition can find fault with. It is open to everyone
in the community to utilise his or her powers of
observation of this remarkable product of nature
and science combined by communicating with
Messrs. John Barlow and Co., T. W. Eady and
Sons, or Mason Bros., Ltd., Sydney, and Jesse
I i nland or R. Hall and Sons, Newcastle.

THE COORPAROO POTTERY COMPANY,
Limited.
To be registered under the Companies Act of 1863, limit*
ing the liability of shareholders to the amount of
calls unpaid on their shares.
Capital, £24,000, lu 24,000 Shares of£l Each,
Of which 7000 Shares will be issued as fully paid-up in
part payment to the Vendor, and the remainder,
17,000, are now offered to the public on the following
terms, namely
2s. 6d. per Share on Application, 2s. 6d. per Share on
Allotment, and the balance by Calls of 2s. 6d. per Share
at intervals of not less than three months.
Provisional Directors: The Hon. John Donaldson, M.L.A.;
J. F. Buckland, Esq., M.L.A.; James Hipwood, Esq.;
J. T. Annear, Esq., M.L.A.; Aoheson Overend, Esq.
Solicitors: Messrs. Macpherson, Miakin, and Feez.
Bankers: The Union Bank of Australia, Limited.
Broker: Mr. A. E. Harris, 188 Queen-street (Member
Brisbane Stock; Exchange).
Manager: Mr. Abraham James.
Secretary pro tem.: Mr. A. E, Harris.
The Objects of this Company are—
1. To acquire the Coorparoo Pottery, Brick, Pipe and
Tile Works, including the Ten Acres of Freehold Land at
Coorparoo, near Brisbane, upon which the works are
erected, and over Three Acres at Meringandan, upon the
Crow’s Nest Railway Line, together with all buildings,
machinery, kilns, tools, plant, stock-in-trade, contracts,
leases and goodwill, together with all the rights and
patents acquired by Mr. Abraham James (if any), and
secret methods used by and known to him in connection
with the manufacture of every description of Earthen-
ware, China, Sanitary and Pottery Ware (in all its
branches), Bricks, Tiles, Pipes, and similar articles.
2. To carry on and extend the said business
The Lands were specially selected by Mr. James oD
account of the Fine Clays contained therein, being emi-
nently adapted for the purposes of his business, and the
supply is, comparatively speaking, inexhaustible. The
Coorparoo land, being Sub-division 1 of Portion 57,
County Stanley, Parish Bulimba, is a corner block, and
has a large and valuable frontage to the old Oleveland-
road, and is within 300 yards of the Coorparoo Railway
Station. Here the Works, which comprise Three Large
Two-story Buildings, Three Large Drying Sheds, with
Machinery of the latest and best description, Three Brick
Kilns, Three Pottery Kilns, One Pipe Kiln, Flues, Stack
and Trial Kiln, Six Three-roomed Cottages (wood), one
Four-roomed Cottage (wood), Two Six-roomed Brick
Cottages (which cottages bring in a total rental of £l6O
per annum), and One Large (eleven rooms) Brick and
Wood Dwelling, with Stabling, Coach-house, and all
necessary Out-buildings, are erected, and these, with addi-
tional Kilns, Drying-sheds, and some further Machinery,
are estimated as capable of turning out at least £20,000
worth of Bricks, Pipes,, Tiles, and Pottery, &c., per
annum, the profits on which should leave very comfort-
able dividends. The Meringandan Land is Cleared and
Fenced, and there is all present necessary Plant and suit-
able accommodation for the workmen on'the ground. The
whole of the business is in first-class going order, and
Insurances exist for over £BOOO.
In addition to the stock at the works, there is a varied
assortment for sale and inspection kept at the Show-
rooms (next Finney, Isles and Co.) in- Queen-street, and
agencies for the sale of the manufacture have been opened
(on commission) at Woolloongabba, Maryborough, Rock-
hampton, Toowoomba, and Townsville, in each of which
places stocks are kept.
Orders for different descriptions of articles manufac-
tured are in hand from the Government, from various
divisional boards, and several mercantile firms, and the
goods generally are disposed of, not only throughout
this, but the other colonies. There is ample room for
extension of the business, and further capital can be ad-
vantageously utilised, hence the proposed formation of
this company. Climatic influences in Queensland are
more lavourable to the eoonomi al production of ware i
requiring dryness and heat than in the old country. The '
labour is conducted on piecework, satisfactory alike to
employer and employed: the raw material is abundant
and easily obtained, and, in addition to the articles being
as cheaply and elliciently made here as elsewhere, the
locally-produced earthenware is protected by the Customs
duties to the extent of 15 per cent. Good returns, there-
fore, may bo fully considered well within the possibilities
of the scheme, more especially when it is borne in mind
that Australia imports crockery, potterv, &c., &c., to the
extent of about £200,000 a year, and bricks, tiles, pipes,
&e., also give a remunerative profit
It has been arranged that Mr. A. James, who is a
thorough expert in the manufacture of all these articles,
having learned his trade in the West of England, shall
(subject to approval of the directors) manage the busi-
ness for the first three years at a fair remuneration,
which has been agreed upon and continue the manage-
ment thereafter, if required so to do, Upon terms to be
arranged, and to impart to others all necessary instruc-
tion.
The property is valued as follows, namely ;
Lands, buildings, kilns, moulds, tools,
horses, drays, &c., valued by’J. F. Buck-
land, Esq. .. .. ; ..£16,865
Machinery, foundations, &c., valued by
Messrs. A. Overend and Co 4,313
Tile presses, just received and erected .. 300
Land, improvements, and plant at Merin-
gandan 200
£21,678
No charge is made for the Goodwill, and to meet the
times the above valuations are reduced by over £2600, so
that the purchase-money is fixed at £19,000, of which,
in proof of the vendor’s faith in the business, fully paid-
up shares for £7OOO will be accepted as part payment,
and the balance (el 2,000) by one-fourth cash, and the
remainder by equal instalments at one, two and three
years, bearing interest at the rate of 7 per cent, per
annum, secured on the property, or otherwise as may be
arranged between the vendor and the company ; and the
vendor agrees that the said 7000 paid-up shares (called
vendor’s shares) to be received by him in part payment of
purchase money shall not rank for dividend until divi-
dends at the rate of not less than ten pounds per centum
per annum shall have been paid on all called-up capital
year by year for the first three years of the company’s
existence.
The Stock-in-trade (manufactured and in course of
manufacture) to be taken at a valuation, and all Chemicals,
&0., at cost price.
The Capital required will be called up as follows -
namely: 2s. 6d. per share on application, 2s. 6d. per
share on allotment, and the balance by calls not exceeding
2s. 6d. per share atintervalsof not less than three months!
Such financial arrangements, however, can be made in
regard to the cash portion of the purchase money as to
render it unlikely that more than 10s. per Share will be
required. Shares may be paid-up in full if so desired and
expressed upon application, and Dividends will accrue
upon the amount paid-up. No application will be enter-
tained for less than fifty Shares.
An agreement between the Vendor and Mr. Alfred
Edward Harris, as Sharebroker, and on behalf of the
intended Company, can be seen at the offices of Messrs.
Macpherson, Miskin and Feez, solicitors.
The only charge on the capital of the Company outside
of the purchase money will be that for Brokerage,
Printing, preparation of Deeds of Settlement, Articles
of Association, Registration of Company, etc.; but should
the Company not be floated, all application money will be
returned in full.
All applications, accompanied by cheques for amount
of application money, to be addressed to the Broker,

Of the N.S.W. barristers on the roll in
1848, not one is now practising. Sir Win. Man-
ning and Lord Sherbrooke (Robert Lowe) are the
only two survivors. Of the solicitors of the same
period, Hon. Jas. Norton, M.L.C., John Williams
(who, we are grieved to hear, is hopelessly ill) and
John Dawson, alone survive.
From July 1 last year to June 30 this year
there have been shipped from N.Z., 500,000 carcases
of mutton, 308,000 carcases of lamb, and 10i
million pounds of beef, the total weight being
113 million pounds, and the estimated cash value
over £1,300,000 sterling. The increase in weight
of shipments over the previous twelve months is
12 million pounds.
An Arab stowaway was lately found in the
hold of a Liverpool ship. He had died of starva-
tion, and had in his intestines these articles :—
Twenty trouser-buttons, three cogwheels (ap-
parently out of a wateh), one 2in. screw bent
double, one lin. screw, six pieces of a lock (the
biggest being IJin. long and |in. broad), a circular
piece of brass, several pieces of iron wire, brass,
lead, and two key-tallies on a ring lin. in length.
The weight of the articles amounted almost exactly
to half-a-pound.

Dear Bulletin,— As a Tory who believes in
compulsory insurance and has always been proud that the
Tories are responsible for the Factory Acts and were
opposed by that stupendous benefactor of the human
race, the Radical, 1 read your article on compulsory
insurance with amusement and interest. But, although a
Tory, I have, curiously enough, found that the Tories of
my acquaintance do not abhor me for my views on this
subject, on the contrary, they say they agree with me
provided “ compulsory insurance ” is not another name
for “ State charity; ” that they have always argued is the
lion in the way ; and that, therefore, any move towards
such insurance must be made cautiously and with due care.
Your allusion to trade guilds is not conclusive, partly
because they did not prevent poverty to the extent you
imagine, but principally because population and trade is
far more complex now than then. But it seems to me
that in benefit societies we have something akin to those
guilds -and that it is on the lines of benefit societies (or
trades unions if you will) that the compulsory insurances
should be effected, only the monetary affairs of such
benefit society—unions—or call them what you will—
must be under effectual supervision, the money given for
insurance must be spent on insurance only—funds
towards strikes, etc., etc., must be kept totally distinct.
As to that “stupendous liar, the Tory political econo-
mist,” I am surprised to hear of him; my Radical friends
have always assured me that though Tories might be
tyrants, liars, &o., &o., &c., they certainly were not
political economists. However, no doubt if a political
economist is a villain, then he must also be a Tory—
because everyone knows all villains are Tories. By the
way, in a recent issue you say the Queensland shearers, in
striking were fools, who cut off their noses to spite
their faces. Poor fellows ! Those who struck were fools,
then, in your eyes to strike —while those who thought
Labour members a better investment than strike
leaders, and refused to strike, were blacklegs, scabs, &o.,
&o. There is no pleasing some people.—Yours, &c., A
Naughty Tory. [This letter may safely be left to answer
itself. -Er. B.]

POLITICAL
POINTS
The king can do no wrong —under a
Republic.
“Nivver will I be shedooshed from me
poast.” —Great N.S. W. statesman.
Now, will Victoria ultimately endure the
Commonwealth Bill minus the One-man-one-vote
principle ?
The people of Australia are just beginning
to understand that all lawful authority, legislative
and executive, originates from them.
“Australian Democracy must conquer
Conservatism, exactly as the North conquered
the South in America.” —Graham Berry.
Canada Macdonald said : “A British sub-
ject I was born, and a British subject I will die.”
So he died, but then the other Canadians won’t.
All the N.S. W. Labour-party’s managing
committee are Protectionists. However, that is
a mere coincidence. There is no fiscal prejudice
in the matter.
The N.S.W. Labour-party is not “ work-
ing for the Government.” It is making the
Government work for it. The Labour-party is
“following” the Government just as the plough-
man follows his horse.
National Protection will come with
Federation all right enough. The Labour-party,
should they let their enemies split them on the
question of Provincial Protection, will be as clay
b the hands of the potter.
Stead, of the Review of Reviews, pro-
poses that, because the Prince of Wales was not
caught cheating at baccarat, he should be
appointed president of a committee formed to
draw up a scheme of Imperial Federation.
Overheard a short time back. A certain
party: “Well, Dibbs, you shouldn’t have left
the old constituency which had been faithful to
you.” Dibbs : “ No, perhaps not. But lam not
the only one who has forsaken his old love.”
London Daily Chronicle : “ The Bac-
oarat-case may have as malign an influence on
the Prince of Wales as the affair of the diamond
necklace did on the fate of Marie Antoinette.
Wilson weakly allowed his family to convert his
house into a gambling hell, in order to curry
favour.”
Squeeze the orange, squeeze it dry,
Make the juices squirt and fly ;
Squeeze it well and make it yield
Sap alike to forge and field.
Skin is tough, but you must squeeze.
Caring not whom you displease ;
Squeeze while any juice you find,
Then, in the dust-bin throw the rind.
Another kindly warning to the working-
man, from Professor Jenks, at the opening of Dr.
Strong’s new Coffee Club, Oollingwood. ihe
working-man must beware of demagogues, who
instruct him to hit out from the shoulder, and he
must always hit softly, so as not to make the
least impression.
Parkea’ position is supremely critical.
The two great parties, the wage-earners and the
monopolists, marshal their forces for the fight.
He will dissemble and calculate chances until the
capitalistic party shall have consolidated itself
for battle. Then, which side will he take t In
the coming fight there will be but two sides.
Prior to the receipt of the Governor’s
address by the N.S. Wales Parliament, it is usual
for the members to be hauled down in antique
two-horse shandridans to Government House,
there to make H.E.’s acquaintance. This tune,
the bulk of the Labour-party protested against
the transit expenses by walking down and back.
The Bulletin looks to the N.S.W. Labour-
party to obtain a review of the so-called trial of
the miserable and socially-obscure Mount Rennie
prisoners, and also of the iniquitous and unjustifi-
able sentence passed upon the cabman Sweetman.
We ask the Labour members to begin by reading
the evidence in Sweetman’s case. No men wear-
ing broadcloth coats ever had such trials under
the British flag.
The question of issuing a daily official
Parliamentary report has been raised in the
N.S.W. Assembly. Considering the character of
the present newspaper-reports, a daily Hansard
is a democratic necessity. It is the obvious
corollary of payment of members and of the
representation in Parliament of the people. There
need be no difficulty about the publication;
Queensland has shown the way.
Harcourt, so ’tis said, is to replace Glad-
stone. This man has thrown himself away, with
his clumsy elephantine buffoonery. The people
want none of him, for he is transparently insin-
cere, and tarred with the brush of grandsonnery to
an Archbishop of York, enough of itself to smear
a representative with the beargrease of the court.
Jocularity must be furnished, as in Palmerston and
Disraeli, with backbone, or it is political cap and
bells.
Melbournian writes : “ Trenwith deserves
credit for the style in which he keeps down amid
the people, after a parliamentary experience now
becoming rather lengthy, and really a man of this
calibre makes sacrifices even for the £6 a week of
a member, with all the charitable calls made on
him. Consider how he might bulge as a boot-
factory manager, on a bigger screw, and not caring
a rap for the hangers-on who insist that he ought
to give it all away.”
According to cable, Premier Salisbury
declares that the claim for the One-man-one-vote
principle is “an unfair attack on the oldest
franchise of the country.” In other words, faggot-
voting may be a malignant tumor on the body
democratic but it is a respectable tumor—a British
tumor, a oonstitootional tumor, a tumor hallowed
by ancient and glorious associations —a tumor
which is the inalienable birthright of every free-
born-Englishman. God save the Queen !
A certain member of the British Cabinet,
who took over a great department in ’B6, asserts
that he has not since spent a shilling of his official
salary. His accumulations therefore amount to
£20,000, with interest. This reminds us that an
Indian Governor-General once also saved £20,000
for his family by similar means, and also that a
certain N.S.W. ex-Minister, who now opposes
One-man-one-vote, lived in a cheap boarding-house
for years while drawing a big Ministerial salary,
and thus put by a sum which now gives him a
sufficient income to live on.
The N.S. Wales’ Labour-party have ob"
jected to pay the three guineas demanded by the
Refreshment Committee prioj to any new mem-
bers becoming free of the rights to dining-room
and liquor-bar. During the debate which fol-
lowed, it was stated, by more than one member,
that these “entrance-fees” had at one time
accumulated until the committee had. £BOO in
hand, and that this sum was then expended in the
purchase of rare wines (they never paid duty !) at
Lord Loftus’ sale, which were divided in parcels
among members of the Upper House !
The victory is with the N.S.W. Labour-
party as it will be with the Victorian and the
Queensland labour-parties if they organise. They
have announced, with Bismarckian candour, that
they don’t care who is in office provided that the
office-holders are the obedient servants of the
majority of voters, as apart from votes ; that they
fail to recognise that the two old political parties
have a prescriptive right to office turn-about;
that they intend, during their pleasure, to keep
the present office-holders in office, but not neces-
sarily in power; that they will accept the Govern-
ment’s promissory-notes, but will, cold-bloodedly,
slay the Government if the latter fail to meet the
bills.
A rumour is current in Melbourne that
David Syme will shortly start in Sydney a daily
morning paper in the protectionist interest. That
may be so, but it would be a very much better
speculation for someone with plenty of brains and
energy and experience and money and his heart
in the matter (there are many factors in the
success of a paper) to start a Sydney daily morning
paper in the Labour interest. David’s late nephew
and partner, Joe Syme, was, it is said, often
approached on the subject of a Sydney daily, but
Joseph always gave the same answer“We
never lose any money in The Age. It is only
when we go outside that we come to_ grief.”
Nathless, The Age’s organisation, especially in
these federative times, could command success in
Sydney--if David would only run his Melbourne
paper democratically straight.
The Bulletin did Mr. Frank Cotton,
M.P., an excellent service in enabling him to deny
being on unduly intimate political terms with
Premier Parkes. The rumour was an extensively-
circulated one, and was published with additions,
and variations in the Australasian. The Bul-
letin does not believe that it is the duty of the
Labour-party to derange existing affairs by throw-
ing Parkes out of office so long as he gees up when
the Party clucks ; but it does believe that it is
their very first duty to pull out his teeth, saw off
his horns, and refuse to fix their eyes upon the
shilling he will offer each of them to see whether
they are good subjects for mesmerism. And it
was in this connection that The Bulletin printed
the apparently unfounded rumour about Frank
Cotton.
The enemies of the N.S.W. Labour-party
are, on the divide ct impera principle, vigorously
urging Mr. Andy Kelly to carry out his airy elec,
tion threat to take revenge upon the Parkesian
Ministry by voting it out of office. If Andy
Kelly wants any more exquisite revenge on Parkes
than the Labour-party already enjoys —\\p are not
aware that he really does want it—he must be a
perfect tiger for vengeance. Here you have the
head of the Pastoralists’ Union chucked out of
Parliament and replaced by shearer Williams;
trades-unionist Houghton is bracketed with the
doughty Bruce Smith as member for the Glebe;
all the rail-sitting Parkesjan hangers-on have been
biffed out so vigorously that you could hear their
skulls crack on the political pavement; and,
finally, you have the Labour-party telling Parkes
and Co. that they may keep their billets so long
as they behave themselves nicely. Revenge !
“ Make thine enemies thy footstool.”
The case against the oath of allegiance as
effectively stated by a daily press correspon-
dent :—
Oaths of allegiance are entirely subversive, and strike
at the very root of representative government. Why are
such oaths imposed ? Simply with the idea of permanently
excluding’ all those who'differ from the then dominant
party from a voice in the government of their country,
and thus making representative government a farce.
“ John Bull,” writing to Sydney D.T.,
points out the interesting fact that an immense
majority of the new N.S.W. Labour-party are
British-born (28 out of 3G), and speaks con-
temptuously of “a parcel of natives like Ewing,
Barton, Brunker, Want, Wise, and Carruthers.”
Assuming, which it is hard to do, that J. Bull is
quite serious, The Bulletin may remark that it
is true that Australian natives have till now given
far too much attention to sport and far too
little to politics ; that, however, is an evil which
may be safely left to remedy itself. “John
Bull’s ” personal illustration is a somewhat un-
fortunate one, inasmuch as, whatever may be
thought of their politics, the six men he names are
in point of all-round ability and worldly success,
just about as forceful a half-dozen as could be
picked up promiscuously anywhere—for four of
them would make more than decent Supreme
Court judges. As to “John Bull’s” assertion
that Australia “ lias never produced a statesman,
or a politician worth the name,” what, we may
enquire, is the matter with Billy Wentworth and
Alfred Deakin ? —and Sam. Griffith, the Boss,
with a big B., of the Federal Convention? Per-
haps the quickest and brightest all-round debater
in the N.S.W. Assembly, up to date, is an Aus-
tralian who has never been to England.
As to the (N.S.W.) Workman’s (N.S.W.
Trades Hall organ) allegation that The Bulletin
desires its downfall in order that it may found a
daily paper on the wreck, no statement was ever
more absurd —as the Workman’s own conductors
very well know. The Bulletin, which finds
much pleasure in hoeing its own row, and which
up to date has been in no way affected by the rise
or fall of any of its contemporaries, daily or
weekly, has no wish or intention to run a daily.
If it did want to run a daily it would start
right on the task quite irrespective of the
opinions or good will of the Trades Hall, and any
and every other body, party, club, person, creed,
sect, or organisation whatsover. In starfng a
really democratic newspaper the main thing clearly
is to' be independent of all parties, especially of
one’s own party, and this would be impossible
under the aegis of the Trades Hall. The Bulletin
reckons it has done at least a little good for the
Australian workman, and it is proud of being able
to boast that it has never run after the Trades Hall
authorities (or any other set of politicians) to
whom it wishes all good luck so long as they don’t
■ grind-any private-axes at the democratic grind-
stone, but whom it personally hardly even knows
by sight to-day.

More loyalty to the Throne and Person !
One of the stud-rams recently imported to N.S.W.
is named “ Albert the Third.”
The story that Kintore made a lot of
money in mines must be true. He sent £2O to
the Alelbourne Floods Relief Fund.
Besant, the novelist, advises story-writers
to avoid lengthy introductions, and start with
some striking phrase, suca as “ You are a liar.”
Graham Berry has been dined and wined
by the Austrian Emperor, at Vienna. Whist —

Market.
Judge Boucaut (S.A.) has started a horse-
breeding farm on a comparatively large scale.
The Judge came in fora good legacy under the
McCulloch will.
In the recently-published Gubernatis
“ Dictionnaire International Des Ecrivains du

Now, who is it ?—Guess !
A story is told in the London studios of a
“financial king,” probably Hirsch, who said to
the artist to whom he was sitting; “Paint me
like a gentleman ; never mind the likeness.”
The late R. D. Ireland, Q.C., made over
£150,000 by the practice of his profession in Mel-
bourne. Yet he died in extreme poverty, even
his pension of £lOOO being “Waxman-ed” at his
death.
It will be a wonder if Spurgeon pulls
through. The Prince of Wales has written a
letter to the sick preacher, expressing his sym-
pathy, and the royal epistle is expected to prove
atal.
Mr. J. B. O’Hara, whose just-published
“Poems of the South” appear to have been
favourably noticed in London, is a rather well-
known Alelbourne man, who has chiefly contri-
buted to the Age.
It now appears certain that there is a
jealous woman at the bottom of the Gordon
Gumming baccarat scandal. In fact her name is
broadly hinted at in several of the London papers.
She is an old friend of Cumming’s.
In connection with the marriage of Sir
W. Gordon Gumming to Aliss Garner there were
no cards. She comes of a self-sacrificing family
—her father sacrificed himself to save her
mother from drowning, in the capsize of a yacht.
The late Chief-Justice Martin (N.S.W.)
once thought a witness was not quite compos
mentis, and suddenly asked him, “Are you drunk?”
“ No, your Honor, I am as sober as—a—well, as
you are.” “Then,” said his Honor, “you are
sober. ”
Albert Edward Binks, son of a respected
clergyman, has been sent to gaol in W.A. for
false pretences. We don’t much blame Albert
Edward Binks. The son of a parson, and the god-
son of a prince, he has simply been foredoomed to
quod.
General Sherman, in his last speech at a
quasi-English banquet, said Queen Victoria used
ail her influence to prevent England's recognising
the South, in the civil war. We never heard this
before. It is odd if she went against all the
aristocracy.
The friends of an Australian gentleman,
whose name has long been synonymous with
wealth throughout the continent, declare that he
is pushed for money just now. And his friends
ought to know. They have probably been trying
to borrow some.
A certain Hebrew lawyer once drew
N.S.W. Crown Solicitor Williams’ attention to
the fact that he was out at the elbows —he was
inadvertently wearing on the street an old office-
coat. “How you Jews do hanker after old
clothes,” was John’s pleasant reply.
An English paper goes out of its way to
remark that in the baccarat-trial witness-box, as
out of it, the Prince of Wales “ was the model of
an English gentleman.” The Bulletin now goes
out of its way to remark that most card-sharps
are of very gentlemanly appearance.
When Sara Bernhardt left Melbourne
railway station for Sydney, she first kissed her
old friend, Mrs. Hector Wilson, and then she
kissed Hector himself. Well, never mind. Sara
isn’t the first woman by a whole jugfull who has
kissed the same Mr. Hector Wilson.
Wilson, M.P., the millionaire who enter-
tained Tummy at Doncaster, and was always
smuggled off to bed by the women before the
baccarat began, has appeared as a witness before
the British Labour Commission, and stated that
he doesn’t think such new-fangled notions are
“ likely to result in any substantial benefit.”
Beulah Hill, Spurgeon’s residence, is
positively one of the nicest spots about London.
We recall the Yankee parson who visited
Spurgeon, with the inquiry, “Brother, I’m
afraid this is too comfortable.” Spurgeon said he
was waiting till this delectable mountain attained
its maximum value, and then he would sell it for
the Cause.
The death of “Rolf Boldrewood (Mr.
Browne, P.M., of Albury) was last week extensively
paragraphed all over Australia. An Adelaide
paper now before us deplores Rolf’s “ death in the
zenith of his fame,” and promises “anextended
obituary notice next week.” As Mr. Browne still
lives, our contemp. had better send his obituary to
Rolf B. for revision.
James Crockett, of Black Creek farm, near
Mansfield, Vic.—a hermit of the Devil’s River
country —is dead. He bought his farm at the first
Mansfield land sale in 1854, and secluded himself
on it ever afterwards. He saw the Hobson’s Bay
railway opened in Melbourne in ’54, but never
afterwards visited the Victorian capital, which he
only remembered as a city where bullock-teams
got bogged.
Dr. Mullen, of Melbourne, is a barrister
and doctor of medicine, a combination which
much availed him in his defence of Colston, the
Narbethong murderer. Delighted were the pub-
lic with his taking down of that rare dogmatist,
Coroner Youl, gravelled by MuUen with student
questions, a common trick on veteran practi-
tioners, who, of course, are not always primed to
answer comparatively elementary things.
“ Bob ” McKay, of Tumut, N.S.W., who
took Boyd, survivor of the Hume and Hovell
expedition to Port Phillip of 1824, to the opening
of the railway line (Sydney to Melbourne) in
1883, for the purpose of soliciting a pension for
the old man, was on Suttor’s Fort, California,
when gold was there discovered. Re was also
among the earliest arrivals on the Turon, after
the gold discovery on Suttor’s ground in 1851.
Coincidence !
It transpires that Mr. Havelock Ellis, the
distinguished authorof “The Criminal,’’and editor
of Walter Scott’s “Contemporary Science” series,
was formerly an Australian resident. Writing to
a Sydney correspondent, he says : “ I have spent
some of the happiest days of my life in various
parts of N.S.W., but in those days I was not
interested in criminal anthropology, and therefore
have not been able to deal with the colonial
aspects of the question as I should desire.”
The new biography of Laurence Oliplmnt
is very strange. He was an eccentric literary
man and traveller, married to a sympathetic,
high-strung woman, both of them under the in-
fluence of a spiritualist quack named Harris, who
persuaded them to remain apart for years, but, as
usual, it proved that he was working round to get
sultanas for himself. Orthodoxy is a thing built
for people like the Oliphants, and if they drop
out of it, the fall is from frying-pan to fire.
Excellent Dr. Singleton’s autobiography
expatiates on the blessed ropes’ end of murderers
—men who really went to heaven because they
committed a murder-, if you follow it out logically;
for if they had remained innocent, they never
would have had the ghost of a show, any more
than the sheriff, or the doctor, or the reporters.
It reminds you of Father Lordan, who said to
ragged Pat, on his reprieve, at Melbourne gaol:
“ Most misfortunate, Paddy, for ye’ll ni.ver be so
fit agin ! ”
At a Melbourne Freetrade meeting many
years ago, the crowd made enquiries of old George
——, concerning a certain governess with whom
he was publicly alleged to have been unduly
“ friendly.” Whereupon George solemnly wallet d
to the edge of the platform, and in his most
pulpit-like voice, exclaimed, “ He that is without
sin amongst ye let him cast the first stone.” No
stones were thrown, but it afterwards struck the
crowd that a man who would thus practically
admit such an impeachment deserved to be pelted.
This happened but a short while ago, as
the age of the world runs. A new arrival from
Maoriland had been engaged to attend the counter,
in a large soft-goods store on George-street, and
one of his first customers was Sir Henry Parkes.
“ The Prime Minister ” was, of course, known to
the dispenser of wearing-apparel, who, after he
had fixed up the old man’s wants, asked : “Shall
I book these, Sir Henry ?” The latter smiled, as
he simpered in that childlike-and-bland voice of
his : “ I don’t think they’ll trust mo. I’d better
pay. ’
Once while Bernal Osborne was speaking
in the Commons, George Hudson, “the Railway
King,” attracted his attention by some inarticu-
late sounds expressive of doubt. Turning on
Hudson he. said: “I must beg the member for
Sunderland not to interrupt me; at this early
period of the evening he has no excuse for making
a noise.” This, of course, did not diminish the
wrath of Hudson, who sprang to his feet and
endeavoured to address the House. Osborne,
however, continued: “Sit down, pray! I accept
your apology. Say no more ! ”
Fish, the voluble M.H.R. for Dunedin,
M.L., was seated at a crowded Wellington table
d’hote one day recently, while opposite him sate
an old gentleman whom he did not know and who
knew not Fish. They were talking politics, and
Fish asked the venerable sage his opinion upon
the present Maoriland Parliament. “I am a
stranger here,” replied the old ’tin, cautiously,
“ and I have not had much opportunity of form’
ing an opinion, but those members I have heard
speak in the House appear to me to be passable—
nothing remarkable about any of them. There ig
one member I have not heard yet, however, and I
am, I confess, very curious to sec and hear him.
His name is Fish, I believe, and I am told he is
a perfect whale at spouting.” Then the pair
were introduced amid the roars of the assembled
company.
Lord Revelstoke, head of the house of
Baring, who lately, as the world knows, lost his
all, has succeeded to a million pounds sterling
under the will of his late brother, “not so much
out of commiseration for his losses as that the
dignity of the family may be preserved.”
General Lopez, Mexican, who sold Maxi-
milian to Juarez and Iscobedo for £l7OO
sterling, died a few weeks ago. Of course Judas
was the greatest benefactor of mankind, and so was
the Scot who sold King Charley for a groat, but
at the same time Judases are apt to be avoided, and
fall headlong.
Sir Alfred Stephen’s weak and inconse-
quential “reply” to Mr. Gladstone' on “The
Law of Divorce” in the Fortnightly is stigma-
tised as “rubbish” by Figaro. The editor of
the Fortnightly is Frank Harris, who travels,
not on matter, but on names. Ten years ago he
was a more or less shining Socialistic light. He
was content to be called “one of Hyndman’s
young men,’’and could be heard addressing crowds
in the parks for the Social Democratic Federation.
After ten years’ hard struggle as a journalist on
these lines, and writing one notorious pamnhlet,
“ The Radical Programme,” in the Fortnightly,
which everyone—what idiots they must all have
been bethought was Chamberlain’s, he was giving
the thing up in disgust when he was offered the
editorship of the Tory Evening News. Shortly
afterwards; he married a smart society widow,
with £6OOO a year and a house in Park Lane, and
got hold of the Fortnightly, which he has turned
into a Tory, Imperial Federation organ. Now
Tummy and Garnpridge and all the “smart”
people come to his wife’s little luncheons in Park
Lane, and it is understood that another Democrat
has “got his price,” and will trouble the classes
no more.
A story of the courtly Victorian Judge,
Sir Redmond Barry : He was presiding in a case
in which a handsome and handsomely-attired
woman gave evidence. It was elicited that she
was engaged in one of the large warehouses all
day and resided alone in one of the suburbs at a
given address. In the Victorian Supreme Court, in
Barry’s time, the Sheriff always occupied a seaton
he bench. That night two tall, command ing figures
might have been seen approaching thelady’s house,
but from different directions. Sheriff Farie had
his hand on the knocker when Judge Barry came
up and prevented the knock being given, and,
with a courteous bow, said: “Pardon me; the
Judge before the executioner.” Barry, by the
way, once received a letter, in a lady’s hand-
writing, inviting him to,a meeting in the Carlton
Gardens. The Judge, who was a gay old dog, not-
withstanding his austere appearance, kept the
appointment, only to find, instead of a beauteous
woman, two men, who robbed him of watch,
chain, and purse, and promised, if he made a noise,
to return and crush him up into his funny
old stovepipe hat. He kept this little episode
strictly to himself for years.

The world has now partially discovered that mere
medicaments Cannot be tised as probably remedial
for all diseases. In almost every case Of illness
excepting those of violent accidents and judicial
hangings, the knife or the detergent are used with
a ‘free hand, and frequently with unfavorable
results. But, widely speaking, we are gradually
coming out of this darkness of blind trust in a
nasty herb, or a sharp knife, and recognising that
in almost every case of disease the cause is the
absence in the suffering system of electricity, the
primal principle of all life. Celsus, an ancient
gentleman who was quite an authority on
the merits and demerits of drugs and, laxatives
in his time used to say, “the best of all
medicines is none,” and gave expression to an
unswerving faith in medical electricity, which
was repeated centuries later by Hoffman in ‘these
words : “ Electricity is the fundamental cause of
all vital motioh. Medicine will never progress
Until we apply to it ‘the laws of mechanics and
hydraulics.” The temporary cure for cancer to-
day is the knife, which merely prunes the poisonous
roots and makes them grow more rapidly. Who
shall say that cancers will not yet be destroyed
by plunging into them an electric needle, charged
with a current of local electricity, sufficiently
strong to blast the growth of the horrible disease,
and yet not strong enough to inflict harm on the
patient. It may be remarked that no mechanism
could be invented delicate enough, to register the
varying susceptibilities of various subjects, but a
recognised institution of Melbourne, the Bethel
Electric Mfedical Baths, 293 Lonsdale-street, gives
the answer to all that. Patients of extremely
various strengths, from the child suffering from
infantile paralysis to the aged Midas who has
been martyred by gout, are treated daily from the
great batteries, and yet delicate mechanism con-
trolling the batteries gives the supplies of life
according to the strength of each subject. If ever
required—and that contingency will arise from
experimentary reasons only —the waters of the
baths could be turned into seas of fire ; as it is,
there is merely a gentle flow without any per-
ceptible “ shock.” The method of application is
jUst this : There are three baths, to each of which
electricity is supplied by the mechanism just
alluded to. The baths are made of pure copper,
and filled with warm water, through which a
double current of electricity is circulated. The
patient has ho contact with Uny conductor. He
merely reclines on a porous wooden stretcher
with cane supports for the head and shoulders,
and is kept in the bath for from 20 to 45
minutes, just as his fancy or necessity decide.
There are trained attendants of both sexes
for the male and female divisions of the baths,
and the Medical Superintendent, Dr. ,H. B.
Wilsoh, personally regulates the electric charges.
The proprietary do not claim the ability to cure
one disease—they have the baths and know that
the system has cured scores of digestive, circu-
latory, nervous, and cutaneous ailments. No
6fie khows how it is that the combinations
of electrical currents produce such results,
but there are the results—solid facts which
all the talk in creation cannot controvert.
One might say that the Batteries said to the
Bath’s Co. shareholders : “You build the institu-
tion ; give us a little sodium occasionally, and get
vour subjects —we’ll do the rest.” Three years
back a Sandhurst man was found to be suffering
from paralysis of the optic nerve, resulting in
almost complete blindness. He had 21 baths, and
is now able to read small print, and look at, a
natural horizon where before, his- vision was
bounded by a false horizon formed by the motion-
less nerve. A 47 years martyr to gout was carried
to the baths howling with pain—he had 42 baths
and can now walk as briskly as a young man.
Another man had been suffering for over
30 years with gout. The last two years of
that period he passed in bed perfectly helpless.
A course of 36 baths compassed a perfect cure.
A young lady who had been a cripple from
rheumatism for six years entered the baths with
one knee three times its normal size through gouty
deposit there. She Was under treatment for fjwt)
months, and shortly afterwards Walked a distance
of six miles. A case of disease of, the kidneys
resulted in a cure, after several renal calculi
(stones) had, been dislodged and passed, when only
two baths had been taken. The cases of acute
sciatica, lumbago, neuralgia, and of ovarian and
uterine diseases successfully treated by this cura-
tive are legion, and in one instance of paralysis,
were both sphincter muscle were totally power-
less. perfect control was almost immediately
restored. Owing to the fact that the Bethel
Baths, at Melbourne, named after their inventqr
patentee, are the second and last institution
of their kind in the world, suffering Queens-
landers, Tasmanians, and even New Zea-
landers come to the Marvellous for treatment.
Already the system of medical electricity
has proved beyond doubt its sterling curative
virtues where success depends on the dissolution
of an internal growth, so will the same force,
under greater tenison, destroy the cancerous
affections that have killed so many. If neuralgia
is the prayer of the nerves for healthy blood, and
paralysis the protest of overworked muscles, those
electro motors that are so carelessly impoverished,
and these two are curable by electricity—if elec-
tricity can give movement to a dead thing, surely
it can arrest the growth of a cancer, or any other
form of parasitic ulcer. , The work of .electro-
medioatiqn, and, above all, that systematised in
the regime of the Bethel Baths, has been wonder-
fully productive of success at the present, and its
certain future position is that of the most effective
of any of the slayers of disease.
Here is an actual illustration of the benefi-
cent working of “ freedom of contract ”:—
Sydney, February 9, 1891.
Esq., —-— : —.
Dear Sir, —I hereby agree to go to your —— Station
and serve you till the 31st December, 1891, as a generally
useful man, obeying all lawful commands of .yourS or
your authorised agenti Wages to commence from the
time of arrival at Station at the rate of fifteen shillings
per week, payable monthly. Travelling expenses to be
retained by you until the expiration of this agreement.
I also agree not to join any Labour Union during the
period of my service with you under a penalty of for-
feiture of all wages then due. -Yours obediently
(Signed) William Newcombs,
I hereby agree to pay William Newcombe under th e
conditions set forth in the foregoing.—(Signed)

Do you notice it? —no written provision as to
rations, all wages forfeitable, travelling ex-
penses to be kept in hand by the master —and
“ fifteen bob a week.” How ironclad are “free”
contracts! The above is an agreement under
which a member of the N.S.W. Pastoralists’
Union Executive, a J.P., engaged the man
Newcombe.
A Fashionable Brisbane Hostelry.
THE BELLE VUE HOTEL.
To the eye oft a traveller re-visiting Brisbane
after a lapse of a few years the progress of the
city is in many respects imposing, particularly
with regard to the number of first-class, hotels
now observable in its leading thoroughfares, and
also_ within the fashionable quarter of the city.
An instance of this is especially noticeable in the
Belle Vue Hotel, which occupies unquestionably
the best and healthiest site in Brisbane'. Built at
corner, of George and Alice and
immediately opposite those splendidly-appointed
bpildings, thq Queensland Club on the one corner,
and thejHousqs of Parliament on the other—the
B,elle Vue occupies a, site immediately opposite
and overlooking the Botanical Gardens, and also
the domain and gardens attached to Government
House. Some few years back the travelling public
were associated with such houses as the Australian,
Oxford, Metropolitan, and the ancient Belle Vue
Hotel, and in those days it was deemed a mark of
merit to put up at either of the foregoing houses,
but now the progressive state of the city has
markedly changed, and most notably as to the
style and quality of the buildings within the aris-
tocratic quarter of the city. To keep pace with
the period, Mr. J. A. Zahel built, on the most
approved plan and design, the subject of the pre-
sent sketch. Occupying a space of nearly half:an-
acre, the Belle Vue, with its imposing three stories
and extensive shade balconies and mansard
towers —every room in the house opening on to a
balcony—is unquestionably one of the architec-
tural points of the city. It is the popular resort
as a living house of numerous tourists and inter-
colonial visitors, also many members of Parlia-
ment and their families when the House of
Assembly is in session. Now, a word as to the
comforts and appointments of the establishment.
To begin with, there is telephonic communication
with all parts of the city at the command of visitors.
A large reading-room occupies the ground-floor,
where are filed on a properly-constructed reading-
desk the local daily papers, intercolonial weeklies,
tourists’ guides, and all the useful handbooks of
the Australian colonies. At the rear of the
readiiig-room is a commodious dining-room, so
appointed as to give families the convenience of
separate dining-tables. On the right-hand side of
the dining-room is a large fernery and conserva-
tory on an asphalte floor, Where the numerous
choice of pot-plants and tree-ferns sets the place
off more as a gentleman’s private dwelling-house.
Beyond the fernery is a well-appointed, brick-
built billiard-room, and separate from the main
building—a matter well worth remembering, espe-
cially when a party is accompanied by ladies. The
houife is built on three sides of a square occupying
a stteet-frontage of about 200 ft. by a wihg-depth
of about 100 ft. At the front coriler of the hotel A
ladids’ drawing-room is placed oh the first flbbfj
and a gentleman’s, sitting and smoking-room
on the floor above. Thesij tooths—and, in tact, the
whole house—i§ clublike (as opposed to restaurant
methods) and quite unapproachable by any but
visitors and friends. The leading corridors of the
building are readied from the main staircase, and
from the main corridors smaller passages lead to
the spacious balconies from whence a good view of
the river, the Botanical Gardens (immediately
opposite), and all the picturesque surrounding
mountain scenery. Large spacious bathrooms for
gentlemen are placed at the end of each verandah,
the ladies’ bathrooms being located off the main
corridors. George-street, of which the Belle Vue
Hotel is the present terminal business house at the
east end—is a broad, straight, well-defined street
about threequarters of a mile in length with the
Roma-street Railway-station as a terminal at the
other end. No doubt the progress of the city will
soon demand a cable or electric tramway, and for
this purpose George-street is the only pre-
sent popular vantage ground that will carry
it —as between Parliament House and the
Botanical Gardens at the one end, and the
principal railway-station of Brisbane at the other.
Another item of the immediate future as to the
city of Brisbaneis probably acontinu.ationof Geofgh
street through the Government House domain,
a Well-constructed, solid bridge, spanning l the
Brisbane River, thus embracing South Bris-
bane as a daughter of the city. These suggestions
are even now agitating the public mind and strike
the observant traveller as matters that should now
be in progress. Advantageous to the position of
the Belle Vue is the proximity of the Alice-street
steam-ferry and open-boat ferry at the other end.
The boat-ferry, it is expected, will ere long be
superseded by steam. These ferries give the
visitor easy access to South Brisbane.
The Belle Yue is conducted by the owner,
Mr. J. A. Zahel, who has recently taken the house
under his own control. This is a sufficient
guarantee that the fashionable Belle Vue Hotel
(the old house for 25 years having enjoyed the ,same
name) has lost none of its well-deserved prestige.
A standing army is a standing danger to
democracy, a standing disgrace to Christianity
and a standing nuisance to humanity.
The commonest surname in Wales is
Jones, Williams and Davies taking the second
and third places respectively. In Ireland the
most prevalent surname is Murphy, Kelly running
it a good second. Smith is a common surname
in Scotland as well as in England, though taking
the Highlands by themselves Macdonald pre-
dominates greatly. The most prevalent surnames
in Scotland are : Smith, the name of one person
in every 69 ; Macdonald, one in 78 ; Brown, one
in 89; Robertson, one in 91; Campbell, one in
92; Thomson, one in 95; and Stewart, one in 98.
“One person in every twelve in Scotland,” says
Mr. Seton, “ will answer to one or other of these
seven names.”

AYER’S HAIR VIGOR is unrivaled for
the restoration of faded and gray hair to its
original color and freshness, and for keeping
the scalp clean and healthy. The most popular
and elegant toilet preparation in the world, all
who use it, pronounce it, also, the best hair-
grower. When the capillary glands become en -
feebled by disease,age, or neglect, this dressing
imparts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its original
Fullness and Beauty.
Ladies And that this preparation imparts to the
hair a silken pliancy and a delicate and lasting
fragrance. Gentlemen use it to prevent bald-
ness, to restore faded and gray hair to its former
color and abundance, and to relieve the scalp of
troublesome humors and dandruff. A proof of
the superiority of this preparation over all
others of the kind is the constantly-increasing
demand for it in all civilized countries.

In the Northern Territory there ia a move-
ment afoot for catching Chinese secret societies oa
the Sam Hop.
George Martin, of Cubbine (W.A.), plain
farmer, ex-miner, and explorer, has undertaken
jingle-handed to fight the, big store agencies that
are bleeding the diggers on the Yilgarn goldfield
by charging famine rates for provisions. Martin
Has sent up to the field his own teams, plentifully
laden with all kinds of stores, and intends selling
them at a merely nominal profit, thus dotting the
ground from under the, feet of the forwarding
sharks. It was for a somewhat similar act on the
old Palmer (N.G-) diggings that Jack Hamilton,
M) P- for Cook (but now unpopular because of his
anti-labour attitude), received the gratitude of the
diggers there. Only, Jack gave his supply of flour
—free, gratis, and for nothing at all.

, Warder Carroll* from Ballarat, has visited
Sydney td examine arid report concerning the iden-
tity qf a certain patient in Parramatta Lunatic
Asylum, whom some people think, or pretend to
tfimk, is Arthur Orton, and, others Roger,Tich-
bqrne. When will the Ticfiborne farce be played
out ?. The more one reads about the case the more
convinced one becomes that the . Claimant got
from the real Tichborne at first hand all the infor-
mation which enabled him to build up so marvel-
lously symmetrical a story. The well-tutored
rogue who plays the part of his master can always
impose on people. For instance, look at the ,case
of “ Lord Yane Tempest,’’ now in Darlinghurst
Gaol., When first he, came to Sydney he ingra-
tiated himself with a local attorney, ordinarily
rather a “ downy ” man, and got the latter
to introduce him to a son of Shem, who
lent him £250 without any security worth
mentioning. A day nr so afterwards the
Shemite saw “his lordship” in confab with the
deputy-governor of a gaol, who seemed to be
lecturing him in a fatherly way. As soon as the
nobleman had departed the financier interviewed
the gaol-official and said—“ That is Lord Vane
Tempest. I suppose you knew him at home?”
“No I didn’t,” said the man of locks and keys,
“I made his acquaintance here.” “You don’t
mean that that is the case ! ” “ Oh, yes,” replied
the official, “he has been one of us." “Mein
Gott! Mein Gott! Mein poor money ! ” gasped
the financier. It was even so. The nobleman
had been a steerage-steward on one of the ocean
liners. He had been in the service of the “noble”
family whose name he took and had become
possessed of the crested notepaper, &c., of his
former master, which enabled him to give an air
of verisimilitude to a narrative which might other-
wise have been bald and unconvincing. All the
Sydney barmaids still believe in Lord Yane
Tempest.

Walter Tricker, of Rangitikei (N.Z.), is a
man who escaped hanging by a fluke, but remained
a lesser victim of that legal drag-net, “circum-
stantial evidence.” In August, 1863, R. S.
Raynor, a settler near Bulle, Maoriland, was
brutally murdered and his body was hidden under
the bank of a creek. A half caste lad, in response
to a Government offer of reward, swore that he
saw Tricker shoot Raynor, and helped Tricker to
conceal the body. Tricker’s defence was an alibi
—by evidence that, at the time sworn to by the
half-caste, he was at Wheeler’s, Parawhenua.
But there was a hiatus of 72 minutes between the
time when Tricker was at his last stopping-place,
Winck’s, 12ij miles distant from Wheeler’s, the
country being of the roughest bush character, and
at the time of the murder much of it being under
water. The jury chose to accept the half-caste’s
perjuries as truth, and to deem it not only
possible that Tricker could commit the murder,
hide the body, and get over those ter-
rible 12 \ miles all in 72 minutes, but that
he actually did so. Tricker was condemned
to be hanged, but his sentence was subse-
quently commuted to imprisonment for life.
Archdeacon Stock took up his case; good bush
riders tried time and again, in the finest of
weathers, to get over those 12| miles of rough
country in 72 minutes, and invariably failed ;
and Tricker was liberated on aconditional pardon.
For 21 years he has lived at Rangitikei, has won a
clean reputation, and acquired considerable pro-
perty. As he has never been fully pardoned, he
is, as yet, disabled from bequeathing his property
by will, and he is, therefore, now petitioning the
N.Z. Government for a free pardon. Let the
advocates of capital punishment imagine that
Tricker been duly hanged in 1863, and that
the impossibility of his having been the murderer
had not been demonstrated until some years later,
and let them ask how would the State have then
proposed to make atonement ? ■

Our Christinas Fishing Party.
(A true Australian story, written expressly for the I
next “ Clown and Nursery ” prize competition.)
I CANNOT say that we were a merry party on
Christmas Day, 1888. My mate and I had held
our festivities a week too soon, and were what is
called “stiff as a crutch,” which is the Babylonian
for penniless. We had met some other swagmen
at the Grubhill wool-shed, and with the exception
of a new-chum cockney they were right enough.
Grubhill is a large station owned by half-caste
Japanese who have a Chinaman overseer and
employ no one but tawny-skins except as jockeys
and trainers. We got some rations from the lady
of the house, who looks very much out of place
among the Mongolians, and who is as good as she
looks, and on Christmas Eve we determined to
halt for a day and enjoy a holy calm, happy in
the thoughts engendered by the season.
I must now tell you that the ordinary cemented
tank is useless for domestic purposes, and we had
to travel a mile for drinking-water. It is a known
fact that a Chinaman disappeared on this station
at shearing time, and another shortly afterwards.
It was supposed that one at least was safe in the
tank and had tainted the water. It is so easy to
make grappling-irons out of fencing-wire that I
determined to fish for the departed Chow.
After a hearty breakfast of Johnny-cake and
Mount Barker butter (dripping) we told one
another that it was a Merry Christmas, and some-
one with a head on his shoulders proposed a tar-
paulin muster. This is a ceremony performed by
brokers and others who desire the maximum of
colonial beer for the minimum price.
I produced three two-penny postage stamps;
my mate found “a kip” and two coppers, the
latter being accepted ; Bill the Baker had two
thrum-busters, and the Cockney had cheek to go
and ask for a gallon of ale for the total of one
shilling and two pence. 1 was appointed to
shepherd the Londoner to within sight of the pub. ,
the Chinaman in charge of which no saveed until
his landlord the Japanese owner of the station
appeared and filled the billy. ,
Just then an event occurred which 1 had cause
to remember in the afternoon. The Mongol
squatter came out of the public-house accompanied
by the manager and two other Chinamen, and
proceeded (with a crowd of larrikins) to form a
ring. The two Chinamen mentioned then
stripped, and fought round after round with
free drinks between. One of them gave in, and
they proceeded home (to Grubhill), but they had
not” gone far when the defeated of#e rushed his
opponent from behind and felled him With »
bottle. He then drank the contents-, and l the last
I saw of them was a fraternal tableau of sleeping
baboons in the wood. ,
Now for the fishing. Fortified- by shebhte I
made my grapplers and tried the tank.
In justice to myself and mates, I must state'
that we really hoped to find a drowned Chinaman;
firstly, on Protectionist principles; secondly, for
the good of the tank, but lastly because we knew
there would be an inquest which means detention
and keep of various witnesses, various boozes
from the enquiring, including reporters (the last
on tick), and the glory of being able to spout about
the justice of fate in drowning Chinamen.
At the first throw we got the Chinaman’s head.
There was the shaven skull and the long queue,
shortened indeed by the falling off of the artificial
elongator which all Confucians intertwine with
their natural hair. Carefully we raised it and
laid it on a sheet of bark We did not “ gaze on
the face that-was dead,” because I contended that
as it (the head) was sadly decomposed, we should
leave it intact for the police and the coroner.
Next throw brought up—what? Another head,
pigtail and all. Then I remembered the fight
between the Chinamen in the morning. Might
not two other Chows, locked in deadly strife, have
fallen in and died without blessing or benefit of
Jossry (my word that)?
Great glee was visible on all our countenances
until the head was dropped on the bark and rolled
over.
Of all the sells I have experienced the revelation
that met my gaze was the worst. The heads were
’possums’. I omit the “o” just for spite. The
hair had come off the back by a natural fell-
mongering process, and the bare pelt, swollen by
internal gases, looked just like a shaven skull.
Thus ended our day’s fishing: Christmas-day,
1888; year of Confucius XXX-ty-X.
Hang such fishing ! to Howlong with Con-
fucius ! and bust Bolivar Box, the squatter of
Grubhill! Lo !I am with you always !
SCOTTY THE WRINKLER.
Galoot is the name of a Northern Terri-
tory aboriginal just released from gaol, after serv:
ing three years’ imprisonment for murdering big-
gin. “You bin see me agen, soon,” he is re-
ported to have said: “My word, ’nother feller
gin go bung, three more years’ tucker.”
A Brisbane witling named- I?eter
Bertram stands charged with the murder,
by shooting, of a lad William, Gfiins.
Peter’s sole explanation..'to the arresting constable
was—“You can’t blame me. I gave him the
gun, and I tell him to look out that it don’t go
off and shoot him.” Gains was never in a, condi-
tion fit enough to give his dying depositions, so
that the facts are at present unknown. Peter
Bertram, nearly three years ago, was badly torn
by a tiger that temporarily escaped from a Bris-
bane menagerie, and was down in hospital for
many weeks. He has been a dizzard ever since.
He is a little, weak man, with tow-coloured hair,
and looks 50 years old, but swears that he is only
25. The law will probably torture this noodle
with ceremonious formalities of enquiry and go
within an ace of stringing him up, when it ought
to berth him in an asylum.
The prospectus of the Sydney Deposit
Bank, whose director is Mr. T. S. “Richardson, lies
before us. This institution has introduced a
novelty for public use in the shape of deposit-
notes, which can be purchased by anyone without
giving name or address, while transierrable with-
out endorsement, therefore can be paid away or
given as security, while bearing interest at a high
rate during the time of currency. These notes are
issued from £10 upwards for any term at the fol-
lowing rates : 12 months, 7 per cent. ; 6 months, 6
par cent.; 3 months, 5 percent. But special rates
can be procured for longer or shorter periods.
The Bank on fixed deposits allows for 3 years, 91
per cent. ; 12 months, 8| per cent. ; 6 months, l\
per cent. ; 3 months, cent., and during the
last four years a bonus of 1 per cent, has been paid
to all depositors in addition to the current rates on
their deposits. This is the only Bank in Austra-
lasia that thus divides its profits.

Coroner Youl (opening the inquest on a
Melbourne citizen with a broken neck): “ Gentle-
men, you have to enquire into the cause of death
of a man who had the misfortune to be left soine
money, which caused his death by enabling him
to get drunk and fall down stairs while he was
unable to take care of himself.” And now The
Bulletin wants to know Mr. Youl’s opinion upon
the following alternatives for preventing such
accidents in future. First, by abolishing drink,
so that a man can’t get drunk whether he has had
some money left to him or not. Second, by
Socialism, so that a more even distribution of
wealth will prevent a citizen being so wildly sur-
prised when he finds himself with a little cash in
his possession that he must needs go and break
his neck in sheer excitement. Third, by abolish-
ing the law of inheritance, so that the property of
all deceased persons will go to the State, and
nobody will have any money left him under any
circumstances whatever. Fourth, by abolishing
stairs.
The Torres Straits pilot-service is in about
as useless a condition as it can well be. There
are nine licensed pilots, four of whom are regu-
larly employed by the B.I. Co., and whose head-
quarters are Brisbane; and five of whom are
supposed to be available for other steamers, and
whose “ home ” is Sydney. Pilotage waters range
from Thursday Island to Bri-bane and Sydney,
including, of course, intermediate ports. The
system, or want of system, is a happy-go-lucky
One of fees. Each pilot receives a fee for each
trip. All five may happen to be in Sydney, or at
Thursday Island, or as passengers going back to
Sydney. Often a steamer bearing many lives
is actually unable to get a pilot, and has to fluke
its way through 1400 miles of pilotage waters
under the command of a skipper quite un-
acquainted with their hidden dangers. An agita-
tion is afoot to have the service systematised,
but it appears that this cannot be satisfactorily
accomplished without united legislation in N.S.
Wales and Queensland. For the sake of the
human life in peril—bbth passengers and seamen
—on every voyage, compulsory pilotage should be
insisted on, and a salaried pilot service instituted,
large and competent enough to meet the great
and growing trade now passing through the
Torres Straits.

It would take a novelist to tell all the
stories of the lofty “Australia ” hotel, but when
auctioneer Gorman said at the opening banquet
that the Parliament of N.S. Wales had been
specially returned to support Federation, his
tale was more stupendous still. The “Australia”
is, without doubt, the most commodious and
gorgeously-appointed hotel south of the line. Its
inner vestibule is as large and lofty as most
theatres, and its bar beautiful as a boozer’s
dream. The sitting-rooms look too dainty for
occupation, and as for the bed-rooms, to slumber
in any of them would give a poor man brain-fever
trying to tot up how much it was costing him per
snore. It is four and a half years since the enterprise
was first mooted, two and a half years since its
erection was entered on, and the total cost up to
date has been a quarter of a million. All the
furniture was specially constructed in America,
and the building is lit throughout by electricity.
Two hundred and fifty guests sat down at
the splendid inaugural dinner in the grand
dining - hall, when Premier Parkes declared
the building open. After the banquet,
a number of ladies entered to listen to the
speeches. They have our sympathy. Now no
traveller, be he from London, Paris, or New
York, can heave the captious brick of deprecia-
tion at Sydney hotel-accommodation. The Aus-
tralia lifts its lofty head and flings the gauntlet of
comparison in the face of creation.
Queenslanders must have large heads ! The
celebrated firm of hatters, B. Mountcastle & Sons,
Albert-Street, Brisbane, keep hats in stock up to
size 7f.
Sara Bernhardt faints elegantly. There
isn’t the slightest doubt about that. The world
is full of actresses who can’t faint worth twopence,
and they grow wearisome. Some of them become
worse than wearisome. The average barnstorming
female seems to lift up her insensible figure with
both hands, and cast it wildly at the furniture, or
the scenery, or the house-cat ; and she comes
down with such a thud that she rebounds into the
air, and thuds down again. The worse the actress
is, the heavier is the wallop with which she strikes
the floor. The Bernhardt, on the other hand,
faints quite inaudibly, and this style looks a lot
better, and doesn’t cover her with big bruises.
But all the same, the Bernhardt method-is not
true to nature. The present writer speaks from
experience. He lived next door to a 12-stone
widow once, who hung out in a galvanised-iron
cottage. About twice a week she used to get
thinking of him who had departed, and then she
would faint. The first eight times she did it he
took her for the Day of Judgment, for the house
used to double up like a concertina and all the
crockery flew off the shelves; but after that he
got used to it, and when he heard a roar, and
then a sound like large quantities of coal falling
down a stair he simply looked in to see that she
wasn’t in the fireplace, and then left. When she
recovered she used to weep till she was quite
damp, and moan and splutter on the sofa till her
head seemed to swell to about double the orthodox
size. And after this experience we can state con-
fidently that there is a wide difference between
an actress fainting on the stage and a real female
fainting in a galvanised cottage. The former may
look well, but the performer’s head doesn’t swell
up enough, and her shoes aren’t sufficiently
trodden down at the heels, and she isn’t genuine.

The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
arm has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
1 other paper, because its vast mass of original and
1 specially-written reading matter is the brightest
I and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
1 artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
| straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
' public.

SWORN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a■ great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last 1 began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. _ At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blow! ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, 1 am as well as eyer.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888. ,
