"The Bulletin" TO THE UNIVERSE
[?]
B’YE d ue our duty without fear or
favour
For several 3'cars”—no, that will
hardly do ;
“ Our bark has now been launched -that has a
savour
Of back-block barks, which bear a hopeless
crew
To wan insolvency—it brings the flavour
Of days gone by, when we were wont to chew
The damper of the bush with savage gusto,
And for mere luxuries of diet, trust to
The monster pie-melon, or parsnip, bloated
Beyond all local precedent, brought in
From somewhere in the woods, by hairy-throated
Wild agriculturists, in hope to win
All men’s applauses. Heavens! how we gloated.
In those grim, vanished years of want and sin
On wooing up .the soul-inspiring ‘ f local ”
To wrest the spnd from the excited yokel!
“ While thanking our subscribers for the manne r
In which they’ve rallied” —oh, no more of this,
You know us pretty well; yon know the banner
We lift ; and what we have to tell you is
That, while you send along the weekly ‘ ‘ tanner ”
As you have done, we’ll give you perfect bliss.
We’ll rain our left-handers on Wrong’s big toe so.
As we’ve done hitherto, but somewhat more so.
We’ll belt the hogslard out of all pretenders,
As in the heretofore —we grow more fit
As wo grow older. In the blinding splendours
Of our own priyate meteoric wit
We'll set up Cant. You’ve but to pass your
“benders ”
And keep a ring, and see us punish it—
To-day we’ve got our bran!-new fighting rig on,
So bring all sorts of humbugs, small or big, on 1
You’ve seen us in the old, you’ve planked your
“stuff” on
Us pretty freely, and thrown up your hats,
And yelled, “ They find the Booleyteen a rough
’un ! ”
“It takes the Booleyteen to give ’em rats.”
And, year by year, our muscles further toughen,
And, year by year, the sturdy Democrats
Have swelled the gate-money, till strength and
fibre
Have come to us with many a new subscriber.
So (metaphorically), with new wings on
We start to day upon a higher flight.
(About these wings opinion differs. Kings on
Their thrones, and drunken Lords, with fingers
white—
Fingers with plethora of priceless rings on
That grasp the Throat of Toil and hold it tight.
Lords of much gold, much land, and many ladies,
Regard them as the bat-shaped wings of Hades.
While work-worn millions, with their thin hands
clinging
To life —poor hands condemned to always slave
For others, ceasing not from work or wringing
Till cramped for room within the kindly grave.
May look on them as like to angels,’ bringing
To those half lost the messages that save—
May look upon our potent quill mercurial
As plucked from out the pinion of Ithuriel.)
We start to-day with the express intention
Of waking up all men, and sailing in—-
You’ve known ns in the past—we did not blench in
The course we set ourselves, “ With gold plate
sinj” '
Says Shakapeare, “ and no paper dares tp mention
A word about it, save The Bulletin ”
(What wondrous truths are writ on Shakspeare’s
leaf.)
Our lance of justice goes through it.like gold-leaf •
You’ve heard oirr history. We have done some
things
Already, anyhow. Down Clontarf way
We once went picnioing, and witnessed rum things,
And told the world ot what we saw next day,
While all the Sydney journals stood as dumb
things,
Because they reckoned candour didn’t pay.
We saw but mandrake where their eyes saw lily,
And, therefore, did a stretch on “ toke and skilly.”
But why particularise ? Vicious picnic
Or brainless Parliament we’ve 'scathed alike •
Whatever seemed to good or virtue strychnic—
{Our word, dear readers, we can always strike
A new one—when we
write our pace is
breakneck
As Irish hunters com-
ing to a dyke) ;
We’ve «truck out
strongly at, and
(though we say it
As shouldn’t) mostly
have contrived to
slay it.
No more as more than
man men hold John
Davies,
No more as much,
the Stigginses and
Keeps
We’ve squelched—no
more the poor
deluded s'aveys
Put their week’s wages into Tontine Sweeps ;
Kiama’s spectre in a quiet grave is,
And, holier still, John Cash’s jawbone sleeps—
(We saw that it was making people wretched,
And got Phil May and Hopkins both to sketch it).
We’ve managed some reforms, and will continue
To work out more, according to our lights ;
We’ll biff out bigger frauds, with manlier sinew,
Made harder by a hundred punier fights ;
We’re ready now to let out straight, and win you
At least a small percentage of your rights—
We stand within the ropes, and bare our muscle,
And .crow for gore and the approaching tussle !
We’re ready for ’em, singly or in batches—
The priest, who prays to eat, not eats to pray,
Whose fat large paw, whate’er his creed be,
snatches
From pallid meagreness its food away,
Who shuts his slaves below the battened hatches
Of ignorance, and this way holds his sway ;
Tire purpled Monarch, from mews madness
building
A throne, where human blood shows through
the gilding ;
The Primrose-eater who pins on the badge of
Earth’s champion badgod and tinselled Mounte-
bank,
And, wearing this, prowls through the slums to
cadge off
The damaged trull some tribute unto Rank ;
But there —we'll come right forward to the edge of
Platform, and announce its every “ plank ”
(“ Plank down,” is yours). If you have recollec-
tion
You’ll know we’ve always strongly urged Protec-
tion.
And our intention is to strongly urge it
Until it has grown law—not very long ;
We’re dead against the lash, and mean to scourge
it
And its high-priests, with our own little thong.
Can brutalism lift up our race or purge it
Of vice, or violence, or doing wrong ?
No— quite the other way—look up the merry
Old-time recitals writ by Roger Therry ;
vmMMWA
We’re for Home Rule—you hear us say we’re for it?
And Ireland yet will have it come to be—
That wretched isle that has played Little Dorrit
To England s Father of the Marshalsea ;
A selfless serf. It shall have Home Rule ! Nor it
Alone, but in Times lordlier fullness we
Will knit our millions in a shining nation
A later, manlier, freer Federation !


We’re for Land-Tax, and not another tax on
The face of earth. Men have too long been
blind,
Too long the patient workful Anglo-Saxon
Has wrought for lusty idlers of his kind;
Too long the weight has lain the weakest backs
on,
But we will clarify the public mind
Till through the land, on farms, in mines and
forges,
Shall blossom a young crop of Henry Georges.
We love not the foul Mongol. This we’ve shown in
Our recent utterances ; he must go ;
We love and strive to free all slaves who groan in
Whatever bondages, to lift from woe
All fellow-beings; we dare stand alone in
The van of those who lift the veils and show
On Kingcraft’s lying face, and Priestcraft’s fea-
tures
Some marks God never set upon His creatures.
What else ? Oh, lots of things ! Whatever turns up
That doesn’t look like Truth, we’ll go for
straight—
We’ll break some idols, tip some sacred urns up,
And hurt some corns, we guess and calculate ;
And from where Etna’s dreadful column burns up
To Nova Zcmbla wo will educate
All men to Freedom (we wore brought up meekly),
And all of this for only sixpence weekly
And, ninthly—look at us to-day ! What money
Can buy of Art is here set out for you !
We’ve clergymen to write things wildly funny
For love of us—they never will take “ screw
And, tenthly—to the ladies— we have sunny
Long curls, can jerk off poetry, can brew
Colonial beer, are fascinating, single, and
Admire the things Australians do in England !

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1887.
“And it was Christmas Day.”
One thousand eight hundred and eighty-
seven years ago to-morrow, was born in
Bethlehem of Judea that Jesus whose life
and teachings were to furnish forth a new
Inspiration to man and a new moral basis to
the world’s social civilisation. The old faiths
were everywhere dying or dead. Society
had become rotten to putrescence. Egotism,
debauchery, corruption, and unbridled
license ran riot, and love was degraded to
the deepest depths of unutterable and loath-
some filthiness. Man had lost all hope, all
faith. The cynicism of despair filled his
heart and embittered his life. Many men
flung themselves into the yawning grave
with all the suicidal frenzy of those who
must get rid of the agony of existence at
any price. The world trembled for a moment
on the verge of a cataclysm. J bsus came
with his beautiful doctrine of love, and his
beautiful life of sacrifice, and the world was
saved. He gave it a faith, and that faith
has been to man a motive for eighteen hun-
dred years and more —and if Jesus to-mor-
row came to keep his birthday with the
world for whom he has done so much he
would be arrested as a Fenian, hanged as an
Anarchist in Chicago, sent to Siberia as a
Nihilist; hunted, hounded down, stoned,
cursed, bayoneted, and trampled under foot,
for the world of to-day knows not Jesus.
« •
Jesus was no splendid, glory-bathed angel
of light and beauty ! Afar across the dim
centuries, we catch a glimpse of the simple
man of the people, the worker, the Com-
munist, the scourger of priests, the de-
nouncer of those who live in riot and luxury,
and who take no thought of the sheep and
the lambs who hunger out in the cold and
the night. The priests, the drivelling dandi-
prats who mumble homilies on Sundays and
various state occasions, paint a pallid pic-
are of pomp and oriental magnificence,
In which the aureole-crowned saints, in
robes of silk and damaskened embroidery,
sit in light and radiance in stately halls of
wondrous workmanship, chanting cjlOrids to
the accompaniment of jewelled harps and
shouting hosannas at the foot of a dazzdng
throne upon which is seated in awe-inspiring
regality the Great Redeemer—the Christ
—the Name in which is wrought all the in-
justice, all the wrong, all the murder, and
all the robbery in our world. Not such the
Jesus who gave to life an impulse and a
hope. Not such the intrepid Democrat,
who drave with unsparing lash the hucksters
who throve by their traffic in the Temple.
Not such the withering and scornful orator
who demanded the amount of profit accruing
to the capitalist who managed to save his
money-bags and lose his soul. Not such
the beautiful Prometheus, of Judea, who
yielded up his life for humanity and died
with the yearning of love in his great noble
heart and the words of forgiveness on his
sweet, noble lips.
* * •
Jesus preached love and surrender.
Sacrifice ! Sacrifice ! ! Sacrifice 1!! “Give !
was the gist of his message, and the »o:-
drous novelty of it, the greatneis, and the
astounding beauty of it, seized upon the
world with a tremendous spasm-grip. io
give, to die, to suffer, to be insulted and
spat upon become the one soul-fi'ling ambi-
tion of the early followers of the despised
Nazarenb. The cross was the symbol ot
denial, but it was the symbol of degradation
also—in the utter abasement of that degra-
dation was the Christian’s glory.
* * *
A change came over the spirit of the
age. Jesus had always preached the un-
hallowedness of wealth. To have aught o
the earth’s riches was to be consigned in ad-
vance to Dives, although he al-
lowed Lazarus to feed upon the crumbs
which fell from his feast, was condemned
eternally, inasmuch as upon earth he had
the joy and the fatness of life, and cared not
for his brother’s hunger. This is the spirit
of Communism, and Jesus, in this sense, is
one of the finest and first of Communists.
But a change came over the spirit of the
age. Rome outgrew its gods. The empire
was too great to hang together, unless it had
a common motive for action, a single rallying-
point, a battle-shout which should thrill the
Dacian from the German swamps and
the adventurer from the Indian En-
phrates. A great master of cunning
held in his hands the reins of Empire.
He saw his chance, this Machiavelli
of antiquity, this saint of the Greek and
Coptic churches, this slayer of his son, this
budder of a city in which the power he
founded should here, too, find its doom ;
he saw his chance, and to his hosts pro-
claimed : “En TOUTO NIKA—IN HOC VINCE.
The cross was no longer the sign of suffer-
ing * it was now enrolled among the insignia
of empire and bloodshed, and figured on the
hilts of the swords by which men slew their
fellows and spread the curse of Imperialism.
t • *
This faith of to-day, which is preached by
priests and bishops, and believed by lords
and landlords—by licensed robbers, and
titled thieves —is not the faith, the sweet
self-denial of the suffering Jew, Jesus, the
preacher of Communism and the friend ot
the people. It is uot Christianity we be-
lieve—if we believe aught. It should
be called Constantinism. Thus re-
ligion of Constantinism is about fifteen
hundred and seventy-five years old, but who
can count the corpses it has made ? It is a
liar as well as a thief, this faith if it is a
faith—of to-day ! Its crimes it heaps upon
the shoulders of Jesus, the son of the car-
penter, and blackens with murder the sacred
name of the truest friend the people ever
had. Murder and robbery and rapine ; lust
and blood and appalling selfishness ; this is
the record of our daily life. The greasy
priests of the brutal robber-lords and the
coarse robber bourgeoisie— the land-sharks
and the labour-thieves —have “ringed the
tree of life, and it now rears its skeleton
trunk against the blast of modern pessimism,
a deadend rotten daddock. The future
stretches before us a sere and wasted plain,
with no patch of lush green grass, no oasis
of hope—there is naught before us but a
boundless wild of misery and despair.
* * *
And the thing called Christianity has done
this. It has slain and robbed in the name
of Christ —but for the sake of Empire. It
has bastioned the doctrine of private property
with the superstitious terrors of the Church,
It has preached the beauty and holiness, the
dignity of labour— for the poor lt has
counselled forbearance and patience— for
the poor. It has inculcated the grovelling
vices of a helot and extolled them as the
first of virtues — for the poor. It has taught
the s weetneas of contentment and advised
pain and anguish as excellent correctors of
pride— in the poor. It has degraded woman
to the position of the creature and puppet
of man’s lost. It has denounced as errors
the brightest and most magnificent achieve-
ments of the human intellect. It has hurled
its feeble thunder at the Darwins, the
Hackees, the Spencers, It has pat upon
the pedestal of its worship the puling frauds
of effete and spineless cant and hypocrisy,
and it has grovelled supine before a brainless
puppet like Albert Wettin.
* * *
And to-day—eighteen hundred and eighty-
seven years after that birth in the ppor
stable—were the founder of the religion
which vaunts his name to appear, he would
be hanged as a Socialist, dangerous to society
as It is at present constituted or, at best, he
would be arrested and lodged in a noisome
and fetid lock-up for disturbing the peace
of “ Respectability h on Christmas Day.
* * *
To-morrow will bo Christmas Day !
Jesus of Nazareth ! how art thou dis-
honoured by the revolting rabble which have
filched thy name !
“Baits."
Ever since England entered upon her great
commercial expansion, which followed on the
post- Waterloo peace and the modern de-
velopments of machinery, she has, more-and
more, fulfilled her instincts as “a nation of
shop-keepers.” Once these instincts were
held in check by others. There was the
sentiment of national probity which was
given her by the Puritans, by the Common-
wealth, and Cromwell. There was the
sentiment of national honour which was
given her by the great inter-race struggle
with France, the protagonist of which was
the elder Pitt. But the downfall of France
as a colonial power, thanks to Wolfe in
America and Olive in India, left her hands
free to organise her trade, and, when Napo-
leon and the French revolutionary Ideas
were struck down at Waterloo, England
found the trade of the earth her own peculiar
Canaan —“a land flowing with nr Ik and
honey.”
• * *
lb is important to realise this, because all
subsequent English history turns upon Eng-
land’s use and abuse of this prodigious pos-
session and trust which Fate assigned to her.
The candid and the intelligent must perceive
in this subsequent history two great facta.
The first fact is the terrible temptation
which such power and wealth offered to
what was, we repeat, in essence, a “ nation
of shopkeepers,” even when fighting a duel
to the death with the ambition of the House
of Bourbon and of Napoleon. The other
fact is the terrible fall that has followed on
that terrible temptation. Ail the Eng-
lish wars since Waterloo have been more or
less commercial, and, as the years have
passed on, the sordidneas of this comraerci-
ality of her arms has grown and grown till
there is now no candid and intelligent Eog-
lishman who is not utterly ashamed of the
blood and “ glory ” which has stained the
contemporary British flag.
* * *
Nor is this all. The old national probity,
the old sentiment of national honour, has
continued on in the simple and good among
Englishmen, and those who were neither
simple nor good have not hesitated to use
this as a weapon both of defence and offence.
The name of England is hated all over the
earth as the name of, at once, the most
selfish nation and the most greasily self-
righteous. Take an example or two of her
conduct which has merited this unenviable
reputation. England talked loudly about
her civilizing “mission,” her conferring of
the benefits of science, culture, and religion
on China, in the days of the Chinese re-
fusal to trade. What were the facts, the
naked, inevitable facts ? The best Chinese
saw the national corruption which was fol-
lowing—and which has followed so appal-
lingly since—in the home use of opium.
They forbade this use. But opium was a
great Indian product, and India is a great
British possession. If the Indians could not
sell their opium they could not buy the
British manufactures. China, accordingly,
was coerced to her degradation, and the
blasphemy of Te Dennis of national praise
to God for religion i and civilised liberty
was the sign of the national greed and lust
in Its masquerade of light and righteous-
ness.
* * *
The history of all the British wars ever
since has been the history of this masquerade.
The provocation and attack of free States
adjacent to England’s great foreign
possessions—the slow, organised exploita-
tion under a military and civil service which
were the mere police for the manufacturers,
what more are the subjtction of the Sikhs,
the invasions of Afghanistan, of Burmah, of
Ashantee, of Zululand, of the Transvaal ?
All the blood and gold poured out on Egyp-
tian sands, from the suppression of the
national movement under Arabi to the fall
of Gordon at Khartoum, sprang from the
greed and lust of the British bondholders of
the Suez Canal. Well did the astute dew,
Disraeli, see that his purchase of the
Khedive’s shares hid, under its “ high-
falutin ” talk about “ the key of India,” the
committal of England to hia Imperialism,
through this greed and lust. Gladstone,
all along, was strenuously opposed to the
occupation of Egypt. He had succeeded in
putting an end to the abomination of the
Boer war. But he failed to do so
much for the Egyptians. The money-
bags were too strong for him, and
the world was to see a typical spectacle like
that of that big, hulking, Jingoistic bully,
Colonel Burnaby, shooting down with a
shot gun the Arabian women and lads who,
naked and armed with knives, were hurling
themselves, hecatombs for the sake of liberty
and country, on the squares of European
troops armed with breech-loaders. How
sickening ! How humiliating ! England sup-
ports the foulest and most oppressive govern-
ment in the world —the Government of a
played-out debauchee and fraudulent insol-
vent. because “ British interests ” are also
the Khedive’s ignominy and shame !
“ We hare nothing to hope or fear,” said
Bismarck, scornfully, before the Danish
war, “ of a country like England.” Nothing
to hope or fear ? No, nothing. Because
England could gain no money by alliance
with Germany, nor yet by assailing her.
The German dynasty did not need to prop
itself up by a partnership of blood and ser-
vice with England as Napoleon 111. thought
he did. Germany would never attempt to
maim Russia and Russian trade in the East in
the interests of England. W heref ore, E agland
kept her hands off the spoiler of Schleswig-
Holstein despite much tail-talk of “ armed
interference.” Nothing to hope or fear?
No, nothing ; and, therefore, England left
Germany alone. England leaves everyone
alone that she cannot exploit, or that is not
worth exploiting. Yesterday she left Aus-
tralia alone. To-day she does not. What
is the meaning of it ? The meaning is clear.
Australia is worth exploiting.
* * *
V When things are bad with us,” said the
British Tory weekly, the Saturday Review,
several years ago (the Saturday Review
by “things” meant “financial and com-
mercial things ”), “ we turn with satisfac-
tion to consider the colonies.” The colonies
here stand for Australia. The capitalistic
England has been awake to the potentiali-
ties of Australia for some time. Oar huge
loans are the proof of it. The commercial
England, dragging along with it the general
national sentiment, is only just awake. The
Exhibition and the Conference wiped the
last piece of sleep out of its eyes. In other
words, England, modern England, the great
commercial harlot, the nation of greed, and
cant, and swagger, has scented a
new prey. The result is already history.
The plundering process has begun. The
brutal demands for money—money, more
money—for that wretched monument of this
greed and lust, the Imperial Institute—the
loud dissatisfaction at what was given the
naval demands, with the same brutality at
the beginning, followed by the same loud
dissatisfaction at the close. This we all
know. But do we all know, or, if we know,
do we all realise, and consider the sort of
underground conspiracy which is going on
to bind with unbreakable fetters to this avari-
cions England—this discredited and played-
out England—our young, strong land of Aus-
tralia ? That conspiracy has a name. What
is that name ? Imperial Federation !
* * •
It is the old, old game ; the old, old game
which England knows so well is worth the
candle. For how superbly cheap it is ! To
scatter contemptible titles among the rained
petty tradesmen or riff-raff professional men
who have risen to the top of affairs here as
bloated capitalists and snobs of the lowest
degree. To send out “ popular governors ”
from the Royal clique who make every
speech an advertisement of the Throne and
“ the dear old country.” To bring the screw
upon the capitalistic press, so far as it dare
go in the face of the profound indifference
of the mass of the Australians and the bitter
opposition of those of them who “drop ” to
the trick. These are the propaganda, and
they are all being worked to death. The
Throne in England is insecure. In Imperial
Federation it is playing its last card. It
dreams of the prestige and national grati-
tude which England would feel to the Prince
and King who had succeeded in handing
over Canada and Australia, and South Africa
tied and bound, to the British manufacturer’
whose enthusiasm for “ fair trade ” or “In-
tercolonial and Imperial Freetrade,” has
just come with his perception of the
first seriously real and great com-
petition of the manufacturers of Ger-
many and the United States. They cali
Albert Edward a fool. It would be
better to call him a knave. The Royal or
rather the Imperial, clique is a reality and a
power. It has plans ; it has a policy. And
Lord Oarington, in the Sydney Govern-
ment House, no It ss than the Prince of Wales
presiding at colonial meetings in London is a
part of that policy. What is that policy ?
The annexation through Federation of Aus-
tralia to England; the commercial union
with England ; the monetary exploitation of
Australia! 7
* * *
All along the line the effort is felt. No
stone is being left unturned. To' bring
about closer trade relations is an equal ob-
ject with the fostering of the << 2 m .
perialistic ” sentiment by means 0 f the
aristocratic and military paraphernalia
titles and “ discipline.” Every day some
new mine is sprung upon us. Let us take
the latest.
• * *
Says the Sydney Daily Telegraph
In pursuance of the policy which has been
adopted at the Admiralty of encouraging cadets
of colonial families to enter the Royal Navy It
has been decided (writes the Times) to establish a
training establishment at Sydney, New South
Wales, on the same lines as that on board the
Britannia, for young officers. The Sydney estab-
lishment will now examine and professionally
educate the cadets. At the end of the usual two
years’ course the cadets will be drafted Into those
ships which, nnder the terms of the agreement
arrived at during the late Colonial Conference
are stationed permanently in Australian waters
A certain portion of them will, if they desire it
be given full commissions in the Royal Navy and
drafted for service on other stations in the same
manner as Royal Navy officers.”
This sort of thing Is very spe-
cious. We are not dealing with
fools. The bait is a good one. The hook is
well-covered. O, Australia, will you rise and
snap at it ? Take care. One snap, and


that cruel steel will only come out of your
writhing body with your flesh and blood.
• *
It is time for Australia to awake. This
last apptal to the miserable vanity of a
drugged and sleeping continent means that
the adventurous youth and growing strength
of Australia are t j be drafted into English
war-vessels, and trained up to worship the
gods of Ei gland,and embatd with sentiments
which will fit them, when the time comes,
to fight against Australia in English in-
terests. The Turkish Sultans were wise in
their genera.*., u, and Britain’s latest device
is borrowed from tha Othmans ; the Selims
and Amuraths of Stamboul impressed by
thousands the sons of the conquered Chris-
tians, and filled with them the ranks of their
Janissaries—the bravest, fiercest, and most
dreaded of the armed pests who infested
Europe 300 years ago—and these military
slaves went forth, filled with the wild en-
thusiasm of the renegade, to crush their
own fathers into the dust when they rose to
strike for their lost liberties. And Austra-
lia may some day have to meet her own
renegade s..ns in battle, just as the
Greeks and Albanians, the Servians
and Bulgarians, and the Latin tribes of
the Danube, had to do long ago. The sea
is the resort of the bravest and most adven-
turous of the youths of the British Empire,
and it is these whom England proposes to
secure that they may be trained up in Im-
perial traditions, and educated In that Im-
perial sentiment which consists mainly in a
lofty contempt of everything which is not
English, and then, in afeer years, when Aus-
tralia is compelled to strike for her indepen-
dence, as America was forced to do 100 years
ago, her own sons will come—in English
ships for which Australia has paid, and under
the command of English officers whose
salaries are drawn from the Australian Trea-
suries—to suppress the “ blawsted colonials,”
and teach them to respect the dignity of
England. It is this privilege—the privilege
of having her own manhood trained to crush
her into subjection—that is now offered as a
mark of especial favour to the new
Continent, and its results will appear when
Australia is compelled to pit her raw levies
against the disciplined forces which she has
supplied for her own undoing. The bait is
carefully disguised. Those who offered it
knew well the snobbish imbecility by which
Australia is governed, and they appealed to
the lowest and moat grovelling passions of
the human intellect by tendering titles and
gold lace as the price of a nation’s liberty.
If the offer is accepted Australia will be
sold for less than the price which Judas
exacted when he sold his Master, and the
bargain on which a drivelling generation
enters with a light heart will never be can-
celled—except by rivers of blood.
Jubi ate!
“ The Duke of Manchester has arrived.”
Some marquises we’ve had of late,
And noble earls a few —
But these are men of mean estate
.Compared, your Grace, with you ;
Sassiety will jump for joy
At getting such a plum,
And Brown will say to Jones, *• Dear boy,
My friend the Dook has come."
Carnarvon’s nose Is out of joint,
And Buckinghamshire dear
Is, so to speak, pegged back a point
While Manchester is here ;
Drogheda sinks to nothing, and

A PROFITABLE PUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
About ten years ago, not a day’s tramp
from Ballarat, set well back from a dusty track
that started nowhere in particular, and had no
destination worth mentioning, stood the Sham-
rock Hotel. It was a low, rambling, disjointed
structure, and bore strong evidence of having
been designed by an amateur artist in a moment
of vinous frenzy. It reached out in seven well-
defined angles, and had a sway-backed building
stuck on here and there; numerous out-houses were
dropped down about it promiscuously ; its walls
were propped up in places with logs of wood, and
its moss-covered shingle roof, o erborne with the
weight of years, and a great accumulation of
stones, hoop-iron, jam-tins, broken glassware, and
dried’possum skins, bulged threateningly, seeming
but to wait its chance to collapse, and hurry the
residents into eternity, with their sins fresh upon
them. The Shamrock was built of sun-dried
bricks, consequently its complexion was of an un-
healthy, bilious tint. Its dirty, shattered windows
were plugged in places with old hats and discarded
female apparel, and draped in green blinds, many
of which had broken their moorings, and hung
despondingly from one nail. Groups of ungainly
fowls coursed the succulent grasshopper before
the bar-door ; a mcody, distempered goat scratched
her ribs against a shattered trough roughly hewn
from the butt of a tree, and a matronly old eow
of spare proportions wallowed complacently in
the dust of the road whilst her numerous brood
fought noisily for first drink.
• « •
A battered sign hung out over the door of
the Shamrock informing the weary wayfarer that
“ Michael Doyle was licensed to sell fetmented
and spirituous liquors,” and that good accommo-
dation could ha afforded to both man and beast at
the lowest current rates ; but that sign was most
unreliable; the man who applied to be accommo-
dated with anything beyond fermented
and spirituous liquors of a very in-
ferior quality evoked the astonishment of
the proprietor, as bed and board were quite out of
the province of the Shamrock. Tradition hath it
that one traveller who had insisted upon being
supplied with a downy couch woke up in the
middle cf the night, racked with aches and pains
through sleeping upon a mattress that seemed to
be stuffed with old boots and stubble, and found
a gang of hens roosting on the rafters overhead
and a maternal goose nursing her brood upon his
weak chest. The “turn-over” at the Shamrock
was not at all extensive, for, saving an occasional
agricultural labourer who came from “ beyant ”
which was the versatile host’s expression for de-
signating any part within a radius of five miles —
to revel in an occasional spree, the trade was con-
fined to passing “cookies” who invariably came
shuffling up on a bony, drooping prad, took a
drink and shuffled away, their clump-footed nags
kicking a lot of dust and sending a family of
swine squealing into the bar for safety.
* * *
The only other dwellings within sight of the
Shamrock were a cluster of ramshackle huts com-
piled of slabs, scraps of matting, zino, and bag,
leaning in all directions, and huddled up as if
to save themselves from haiog carried off by the
next breeze. These were the habitations of a
colony of squalid, gibbering Chinese foasickera
who hived together like hogs in a crowded pen, as
if they had been restricted to that spot on pain of
death or a square wash.
* * *
About a quarter of a mile behind the pub.
ran, or rather crawled, the sluggish waters of
Yellow Creek. Once upon a time, when the
Shamrock was first built, the creek was a beau-
tiful, limpid rivulet running between ver-
dant banks ; but an enterprising prospector,
wandering that way and liking the indications,
put down a shaft and bottomed on the wash at 20
feet, getting half-an-ounce to the dish. A rush
set in, andinabout 12 monthsthe banks of the creek
for a distance of two miles were denuded of their
timber, torn up and covered with unsightly heaps.
The creek had been diverted from its natural course
half-a-dozen times, and hundreds of diggers, like
busy ants, delved into the earth, and covered its
surface with red, white, and yellow tips. Then
the miners left almost as suddenly as they had
come; the Shamrock, which had resounded with
wild revelry, became as silent as a morgue, and
desolation brooded on the face of the country.
When Mr. Michael Doyle, whose greatest am-
bition in life had been to lord it in a pub., in-
vested in that lucrative country property, saplings
were growing between tha deserted holes of the
diggings, and the agricultural had superseded the
mining industry in those parts.
* * *
Mr. Doyle was of Irish extraction ; hia
family was so old that everybody had forgotten
Where and when it originated, but Mickey was
not proud—he put on no unnecessary style, and his
personal appearance would not lead you to infer
that there had been a king in his family, and that
his paternal progenitor had killed a Hand lord
“wonst." Mickey was a small, scraggy man,
with a mop of grizzled hair, and a little, red,
(humorous face, which ever bristled with auburn
stubble, and would have served at any moment to
grate a carrot on. Michael’s trousers were the
.most striking things about him ; they were built
on the premises, and always contained enough
stuff to make him a full suit and a winter over-
coat. Mrs. Doyle concocted those pants after
plans and specifications of her own designing, and
was mightily proud when Michael would yank
them up into his armpits, and amble about, peer-
ing discontentedly over the waist-band —“They
W,us th’ great savin’ in weskits,” she said.
» * •
Of late years It had taken all Mr. Doyle’s
ingenuity to accomplish the difficult feat of
making ends meet. The tribe of dirty, unkempt
urchins who swarmed about the place “took a
power of feedin’,” and Mrs. D. herself was “th’
big ater.” “Yedo be atin’ twenty-fours a day,”
her lord was wont to remark, “ and thin yez must
get up av noights for more. W hen ye r not atin’
ye’r munchin’ a schnack, bad cess t’y I ”
* * *
In order to provide the provender for hia
unreasonably hungry family, Mickey had been
compelled to supplement his takings as a Boniface
by acting al’erra elyas 'osslrKcr, ch wcoal-barm r,
and “ wood-Umbei ; ” but ic came “ bur ble
ha d” on the little man, and bo waxed IhinLer
and thinner, and sank deeper into his trousers
every year. Then, to augment his troubles, came
the pestiferous heathen, the teetotal Chinee. He
came in numbers, like a plague, armed with picks,
shovels, dishes, cradles, and tubs. He c me one
hob summer day with a clatter of tools and a
babble of grotesque gibberish, and camped by the
creek and refused to go away again. The awe-
some solitude of the abandoned diggings was
ruthlessly broken, the sanctity of the deserted
field which, with its white mounds and decaying
windlass stands fallen aslant, lay like a long-
forgotten cemetery buried in primeval forest, was
desecrated by the hand of the Mongol, and the
sound of his crude, Oriental profanity. The Chows
swarmed over the spot, tearing open old sores,
shovelling old tips, sluicing old tailings, digging,
cradling, puddling, ferreting into every nook and
cranny, and turning the whole face of the field
into distraction.
* * *
Mr. Doyle observed the foreign invasion
with mingled feelings of righteous anger and
painful solicitude. He had found fossicking by
the creek very handy to fall back upon when the
wood-jambing trade was not brisk, but now that
stand-by was ruined by Chinese competition, and
Michael could only find relief in deep and earnest
profanity.
* * *
Concomitant with the Pagan influx began
the mysterious disappearance of small valuables
from the premises of Michael Doyle, licensed vic-
tualler ; sedate, matronly old hens, hitherto noted
for their strict propriety anl regular hours, would
leave the place at dead of night, and return from
their nocturnal rambles never more ; mercurial
sucking-pigs which had erstwhile absolutely re-
fused to be driven from the door, corrupted by
the new evil, absented themselves suddenly from
the precincts of the Shamrock, taking with them
cooking utensils and various other articles of small
value, and thenceforth their fate became a mat-
ter for speculation. At last a favourite young
porker went, and its lord and master, resolving to
prosecute enquiries, bounced into the Mongolian
camp, and, without any unnecessary preamble,
opened the debate: —“Look here now I' 1 he ob
served, shaking his fist att v o group, and brisk ing
fiercely, “ which av ye dhirty, hathen furrinera
cum up to me house Jasht noight, and shtole me
pig, Nancy ? Wh'cb av je, so’t I kin bate ye, ye
thavin’ yellow-dogs T’
* * •
The placid Orientals surveyed Mr. Doyle
coolly, and innocently smiled, and said, “No
savee then bandied jests at his expense in their
native tongue, and laughed the little man to
scorn. Incensed by the evident ridicule of the
“hathen furriners,” and goaded on by the
smothered squeal of a hidden pig, Michael went
for the nearest Asiatic, and proceeded to put a
head on him as big as a tank, amid a storm of
kicks and digs from the other Chows. Presently
the battle began to go against the Irish cause, but
Mrs. Mickey made a timely appearance, and
warded the surplus Chinamen off by chipping at
their skulls with an axe-handle The riot was
soon quelled, and the two Doyles departed trium-
phant, beaming away a corpu’ent young swine,
and leaving a broken, di cruraged Chinaman to
be doctored at his own expense.
« *
*
After this gladsome little episode the
Chinamen held off for a few weeks ; then they
suddenly changed their tactics, and began to try
all they knew to cultivate the friendship of
Michael Doj la and hia able-bodied wife. They
liberally patronised the Shamrock, and beguiled
the licensee with soft but cheerful conversation ;
they flattered Mrs. Doyle in seductive pigeon-
Englieh, and endeavoured to ensnare the children’s
young affections with preserved g’nger. Michael
j regarded i hese advances with misgiving ; he sus-
| peoted the Mongolians’ Intentions were not
honourable, but was not the man to spoil trade—
to drop the substance for the shadow. This sta f e
of affairs had continued for come time before the
landlord cf the fchamrock noticed that his new
customers made a point of carrying off a brick
every time they visited his pub. When leaving
fihe bland heathen would cast his discriminating
I eye round the place, hastily seize upon one of the
j sun-dried bricks with which the ground was lit-
i tered andstealaway withanonchalantair as though
i it had just occurred to him that that brick would
1 come in useful. This matter puzzled Mr. Doyle
sorely ; he ruminated over it, but the only conclu-
sion he could come to was thatitwasn’t good enoagh
to lose custom for the sake of a few bricks; so
the Chinese continued to walk off with his build-
ing material whenever opportunity offered, and,
when asked what they intended to do with the
bricks, assumed an expression of the most dep’or-
ably hopeless idiocy, and suddenly lost ihtir ac-
quaintance with the English tongue. If bricks
were under discussion they hadn’t the comprehen-
sion of wombats, although they seemed pretty
bright on other points. Mickey noticed that
there was no building b:-ing done at their tamp,
i also that there were no bricks to be seen about
j the domiciles of the Pagans, and he tried to
j figure the mystery out on a elate, but, on account
! of bis lamentable ignorance of mathema ics,
, failed to reach the unknown quantity and elucidate
the enigma. Mr Doyle watched the invaders get
away with all the loose bricks which were scat-
tered around, and never oompla’ned, but when
they started to abstract one end of bis
licensed premises he felt himself called upon as a
husband and father to uprise, and enter a protest.
Which he did pointing out to the Yellow Agony
I in graphic and forcible language the gross wicked-
! ness of robbing a struggling man of his house
and home, and promising faithfully to “bate”
the next lop eared child of the Sun whom ha
“ cot shiftin’ a’er a brick.” “ Blast ye ! wud
yez shtale me hotel, so’t whin me family go insoide
they’ll be out in th’ rain V he queried. lookiag
hurt and indignant.
* * *
The Chinamen said they did not “ savee,”
but after this warning they went to great pains
and displayed much ingenuity in abstracting
bricks without the cognition of Michael Doyle-
out of consideration for his feelings, doubtless.
But Mr. Doyle was active ; he watched them
closely, and when he caught a Chow in the act, a
brief conflict raged on the spot, and a dismantled
Chinaman surely eventuated. This conduct on
the part of the landlord served in time to entirely
alienate the Mongolian custom from the Sham
rock, and once more Mick and the Chows never
spoke as they passed by. Once more promising
young pullets started to go astray in company
with other portable valuables, and still the hole in
the wall grew till the after part of the Shamrock
looked as if it had tried to stop a runaway cannon
ball. The Chinamen came when Michael slept, and
filched his hotel, inch by inch. They lost their
natural rest, and ran the gauntlet of Mr. Doyle’s
kick and his curee, all for a few bricks. Ac all
hours of the night they crept through tho gloom,
and softly, warily, btoli a bat or two, getting
away unnoticed perhaps, or, may e, disturbing
the tlumbers of Mrs. Doyle, who was a very 1 ght
sleeper for a woman of her size. In the latter
case; Mrs, D. would waken her lord by holding his
nose—a very effective plan of her own—and
filled to overflowing with hate and spiteful invec
tiye, Mick w ould turn out in his shirt to cope
with the marauders, and course them over the
paddocks. If- he caught a heathen, he just laid
himself out to indulge in five minutes’ ener-
getic entertainment, which repaid him for
lost rest and missing hens, and left a
Chinaman too heartsick and sore to steal
anything for a week or so; but hia friends
would come as usual, and the pillage went on.
Michael Doyle puzzled himself bald-headed trying
to make head or tail of this imatiable and un-
reasonable hunger for bricks ; such an infatuation
on the part of Chinamen for cold and unrespon-
sive clay had never before come within the pale
of his experience, and it prostrated him quite.
Times out of mind he threatened to “ have the
law on the dirty bla’gards,” but the law was a
long way off, and the Celestial house-breakers
continued to elope with scraps of the Shamrock,
taking the proprietor’s assaults humbly and as a
matter of course.
“ Why do ye be shtealing’ me house ?" fiercely
queried Mr. Doyle of a submissive Chow whom ho
had taken in the act of ambling off with a brick
in each hand one night.
“ Me no stealem, no feah ! odder fellah, him
stealem! ” replied the quaking Pagan.
Mickey was stricken dumb for the moment by
this awful, bald prevarication, but that did not
impare the velocity of his kick ; he wished it had
afterwards, for the Chinaman had stowed another
brick away in his pants for convenience of transit,
and the landlord struck that brick ; then ho sat
down and repeated aloud all the profanity he
kne v, and wished ha were a boy again, so that ho
could gat his toe into his mouth. The Chinaman
escaped, and had presence of mind enough to io-
tain the bricks.
* # *
For months the work of devastation went
on. Mr. Doyle set ingenious mechanical contri-
vances about his hoase, and turned out at early
dawn to see how many i hicamen he had nailed,
only to find his spring-traps stolen and his hotel
yawning more de=perately than ever. Then
Michael could but lift up bis voice and swear—
nothing else afforded him any relief. At last he
hit upon a brilliant idea. He commissioned a
cookie who was journeying into Ballarat to buy
him a dog, the largest, fiercest, ug ie-t, hungriest
animal the town afforded ; and next day a power-
ful, iil-tempered canine, as big- as a horse and as
ugly as a nightmare was duly installed as guar-
dian and night-watch at the Shamrock. R'ghfc
well the good dog performed his duty, too. On
the following morning he had trophies to show in
the shape of a hoot, a scrap cf trousers, half a
pig-tail, an ear, and a good part of a sc dp; and
ju-t then the nocturnal visits ceased. Tha Chov> a
Sient a week skirmishing round, endeavouring to
call the dog off, but he wao to be neither begged,
borrowed, nor stolen ; he was too o'.d-faohicned to
eat poisoned meat, and resented the small-
est approach to familiarity on the part
of a Chinaman by snapping off the mrsb service-
able portions of his pants, and always fetching a
scrap of Chinaman along with them. This dis-
couraged the Johns in time, and they drew off to
hold congress and give the matter weighty con-
sideration, After deliberating for some days, the
yellow sottiement sent a deputation to wait upon
Mr. Doyle. Mick saw them coming and he armed
himself with a log and unchained his dog ; Mrs.
Doyle ranged up alongside -brandishing her axe-
handle, but, by humble gestures and a deferential
bearing, the Celestial deputation implied a truce.
So Michael held his dog down and rested on hia
arms to await developments. The Chinamen
advanced smilieg blandly; they gave Mr. and
Mrs. Doyle a fraternal greeting, and squirmed
with that wheedling obsequiousness peculiar to
“ John ” when he has something to gain by it A
pock-marked leper wi:h a face like a moon-struck
Kanaka placed himself in the van and assumed
the speakership :
“Nicee day, Missa Doyle,” he said, sweetly.
Then, with a sudden expression of great interest
and nodding towards Mrs, Doyle, “ How you
sisEctah ?”
“Foind out! Fwhat’ra yez wantin’?’ replied
the host of the Shamrock, gruffly, “ T’ ahtalo
more bricks, ye crawlin’ bla’g’ardt: ?'
“ No, no ! Me no stealem b’lck, odder fellah ;
he hide ’em, build big house byem-byet”
“ Ye loi 1 ye screw-faced nayger ! I seed y’ do
it, and if yez don’t cub and run I’ll lave the dog
loose to feed on yer dhirty carcasses.” The dog
tried to reach for his favourite hold, Mick
brandished his log, and Mrs. Doyle took a fresh
grip of her weapon. This demonstration gave i in
Chaws a cold shiver, and brought them promptly
down to business
•‘Webuyem you hotel; what for you sellem,
eh ?”
“Fwhatl Yez buy me hotel ? D'ye mane it ?
Porchis th’ premises, and yez can shtale ivery
brick at yer lishu e I But ye’re ioakin’. Whoop!
Look ’ae here. 111 have th’ lot av yez aten up in
two minits if yez play yer Choinece Isrks on
Michael Doyle!”
* •
The Chinamen protested eagerly that
they were in earnest, and Mickey gave them an
impartial hearing. For two years he hod b o in
want of a customer for the Shamrock, and he
hailed the offer cf the “ ha'hens” with secret de-
light. After barneying for an hour, during which
time the ignorant Chinee wi h the contorted
countenance displayed much business-tact and
deep guile, a bargain was struck. The Chin: men
agreed to give £SO cash for the Shamrock
and all out-houses appertaining thereto, and
the folio *iog Monday was the day fixed whereon
Michael was to journey into Ballarat with a couple
of repraeentative heathens, to sign the transfer
papers and receive the cash. The deputation
departed tmllitg, and when it gave the r.ews of
its triumph to the other denizens of the camp
there was a perfect babel of congratulations in
the quaint dialect of the Mongol, and th j China-
men proceeded to make a night of It in their om
outlandish way, indulging freely in the seductive
drug, opium, and holding high carouse ewer an
extempore fan-tan table, from which it was evi-
dent that they thought they were getting the best
of Michael Doyle, licensed victualler. Michael,
tco, was rejoicing with exceeding great joy, and
congratulating himself on being the shrewdest
little man from home He had never hoped
to get more than a £2O note for the dila-
pidated old building; it was erected on Crown
land, and could nob be expected to stand the wear
and tear of another 18 months. As for the busi-
ness, it had fallen off to a shadow, and could hardly
be relied upon to keep a Chinaman in soap. Mr
Doyle plumed himself on his bargain and swelled up
till he nearly filled his trousers. Still he was harassed
to know what could possibly have attached the
Chinese to strongly to tha Shamrock. They had
taken samples from every pa'-c of the er l ablish-

free to confess he’d never seen anything so quare
before, saving cnoe, when his grandfather was a
boy ’
After the agreement arrived at between
the publican and the Chows, one or two of the
latter contrived to hang about the hotel nearly
all their time, keeping watch and ward. The dog
was retained on the chain, and lay ia the sun all
day in a state of moody melancholy, sorutinizlrg
the Mongolians narrowly. He was a strong anti-
Chinese dog, and had been educated to regard the
almond-eyed invader with mistrust and hate, and
it was repugnant to his principles to have to lie
low when the heathen was around, so he evinced
his resentment by growling almost ceaselessly for
three days.
« * *
Sunday dawned. It was a magnificent
morning, but the rattle of the Chinamen’s cradles
and toms sounded from the creek as usual. When
it is left to his own option, the Chow would
always rather earn sixpence than take a day of
rest. Three or four suave and civil Asiatics,
however, still lingered about the Shamrock,
and kept an eye on it in the interests of all,
for the purchase of the hotel was to be a joint-
stock affair. These “Johns” seemed to imagine
they had already taken lawful possession; they
sat In the bar most of the time, drinking little,
but always affable and genial. Michael suffered
them to stay, because he feared any ffactiousness
on his part might upset the li tie agreement he
had made with them, and that was a consumma-
tion to be avoided above all things. They had
told him, with many tender smiles and much
gesticulation, that they intended to live in the
house when it became theirs, but Mr, Doyle was
not interested -he did not care a swear if they
boiled it down for hominy.
* * *
Michael was in great good spirits that
morning; he beamed complacently on all and
sundry, appointed the day as a time of family
rejoicing, and in the excess Of his emotion actually
slew a prime young sucking-pig for dinner,
an extravagant luxury indulged in by the Doyles
only on state occasions. Oa this particular Sun-
day, the younger members of the Doyle household
gathered early round the festive board and waited
expectantly for the spuds and cabbage and suc-
culent baby-pig. There were nine children in
all, ranging in years from II downwards—
, * foine sthrappin’ cbilder wid tb’ clear brain,”
said Michael—but then Michael was prejudiced.
The round, juicy sucker was placed upon the
table, Mrs. Doyle stood prepared to administer
her deparlment—serving the vegetables to her
hungry brood —and, armed with a formidable
knife and fork, Michael hovered over the pig, en-
veloped in its savoury steam. But there was one
function yet to be performed, a function which
came as regularly as Sunday’s dinner itself.
Never, for years, had the house-father failed to
touch up that prodigious carving-knife on one
particular hard, yellow brick fn the wall by the
door, preparatory to carving the Sunday’s meat.
Mickey examined the edge of his weapon critic-
ally, and found it unsatisfactory. The knife wts
nearly ground through to the backbone ; another
“touch-up” and it must surely collapse, but, in
view of his changed circumstar css, Mr. Dojle felt
that he might take the lisk. The brick, too, was
worn an inch deep. A few sharp strokes from
Mick’s vigorous right arm was all that was re-
quired, but, alas! the knife broke, whereupon
Mr Doyle swore at the brick, as if he held it
“ immediately reshponshible ” for the mishap, and
stabbed it fiercely with the broken carver.
“ Howly Moses 1 Fwhat’s that ? ”
The brick fell to pieces, and there, embedded
in ths wall, gleaming in tbo sunbeam, was a nug-
get of pure yellow gold. With feverish haste
Mick tore the brick from its bedding, and smashed
the gold-hearing fragment on the hearth. The
nugget was a little beauty—smooth, round, and
four ounces to a gram.
* * *
The sucking-pig froza and stiffened in its
fat, the “ taters ” and the cabbage stood neglected
on the dishes. A gleam of the truth bad dawned
upon Michael, and whilst the found of a spirited
debate in musical Chinese echoed from the bar,
his family was gathered a-ound him, watching
open-mouthed, and Mick was industriously, but
quietly, pounding the sundried brick in a mortar.
Two bricks, one from each end of the Shamrock,
were pulverised, and Michael panned off the dirt
in a tub of water which stood in the kitchen.
Result : seven grains of waterworn gold Up to
this Michael had worked dumbly, in a fit of ner-
vous excitement; now he started np, bristling like
a hedgehog.
“ Let loose th’ dog, Mary Melinda Doyle 1 he
howled, and, uttering a mighty whoop, he bounded
into the bar to dust those Cbicamen off his
premises.
“ Ger out 1” he screamed, climbing nearly two
feet out of his capacious pants. “ Ger out av me
premises, ye thavin’ crawlers 1” And he frolicked
with the astounded Mongolians like a tornado in
full blast, thumping at a shaven “ occiput” when-
ever one showed out of tha struggling crowd. The
Chiiamen left, they found the dog waiting for
them outside, and he encouraged them to leave
some more ; in fact, they had to leave anything
he got hold of, or else stay and argue the matter
out, and they didn’t seem at all indited to do
that. L’ke startled fawns the heathens fled, and
Mr. Doyle followed them, howling :
“Bay the Shamrock, will jez? Robbers 1
Thaves ! Fit cb back th’ soide o’ me house, or D ili
have th’ law onto yez all!” The damaged es-
capees communicated the intelligence of their
overthrow to their brethren on the creek, and the
news carried consternation and deep, dark woe to
every Mongol. The Pagans knew their little pat
had boiled over, and that was worse than a family
bereavement. They clustered together, and rue-
fully discussed the situation.
* * *
Mr. Doyle was wildly jubilant, his joy
was only tinctured with a spice of bitterness, ihe
result of his knowing that the “ hathens ” had
got away with a few hundreds of his golden
bricks. He tried to figure out the amount of gold
his hotel must contain, but again his ignorance of
arithmetic tripped him up, and already in imagi-
nation Michael Doyle, licensed victualler, was a
millionaire and a J.P.
* * *
The Shamrock was really a treasure house.
The dirt of which the bricks were composed had
been taken from the banks of Yellow Creek years
before the outbreak of the rush by an eccentric
German who determined to settle on that sylvan
spot. The German died, and his grotesque struc-
ture passed into other hands. Time went on, and
then came the rush. The banks of the creek were

Before nightfall Michael summoned half-a-
dozen men from “ beyant ” to help him protect
his “pub” from a possible Chinese invasion.
C:her bricks were crushed and yielded splendid
prospects. The Shamrock’s small stock of liquor
was drunk, and everybody spent a hilarious time
On the Sunday night, under cover of the dark-
ness, the Chows made a sudden sally on the
Shamrock, hoping to get away with a number of
coveted bricks. They were received, however,
with vlo'ence and clubs, and were put to con
slderable inconvenience by an enthusiastic mastiff
which took part in the defence, but they got no
bricks, and returned to their camp broken and
disconsolate.

Next day the work of demolition started.
Drays were backed up against the Shamrock, and
load after load of the precious bricks was carted
away to a battery about four miles off. The
Chinamen slouched about watching greedily, but
any attempt at interference on their part met with
a peremptory and painful reprisal. Mr. Doyle
sent his family and “furniohoor” into BaTarat,
and in a week there was not a vestige left to

which Mr. Doyle cleared out of the ruins of his
pub. He is now a man of some standing in Vic-

the beauty of the innocent creature's story were
that she had been assaulted in the same way once

On Thursday, 15bh December, all the
outward symptoms of a great Success were
gathered together at Sydney Criterion on the oc-
casion of Miss Essie Jenyns’ benefit, and that
be »nt ful and ta’ented actress looked her best as
Shakespeare’s Rosalind. “As You Like it ” with
Mifs Jenyns as the heroine can always command
a full house in Sydney, and, as the popular
favourite will soon be on her way across the wail-
ing deep to commence a season in London, every-
body rolled up to whoop a fond farewell till the
seething multitude trod each other flat. If the
Australian star is not good enough for at least
a moderate success in London, then London
must hive grown difficult to satisfy, and,
in common with her other admirers, we
devoutly trust that Miss Jenyns may not be sea-
sick en route. At the close of the performance
five well-known lawyers and three miscellaneous
citizens got up on the stage with a view to pre-
seating the heroine of the evening with a
splendid diamond pendant. [lt c:st £l6O
by the way ] The lawyers took the lead and
the three miscellaneous citizens were shunted
ino the re'r There were but two bald-headed
men in the deputation, and only ore man had his
moustache dyed purple Presently Sir George
Innes, who had a feeg in his throat, began a long
oration with ncany “ere'’ interspersed, and Miss
Jenyns shifted wearily from one foot to the other
as he jawed along on bis dismal, dusty way. By-
and-bye he paused and held out the diamond orna-
ment, and, natnrally enough, the poor little woman
reached for it, but, with true professional instinct,
he tantatiaingly dropped his hand again, clutched
the valuables, and went on talking. He made
sundry sad professional jokes about a rule abso-
lute, and, after relating the dismal wheeze about
Shakespeare being fu’l of quotations, his Honor
suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, concluded and
gave way to the pallid Pilcher, who made his first
appearance as a beast of bnrden carrying a huge
album, the gi't of certain ladies of Sydney.
Pilcher has slang-whanged defendants in
the jury-court all his life, and a dozen times he
was evidently on the verge of reminding Miss
Jenyns that she was on her oath, and that her
evidence was most suspicious, but he choked him-
self off each time. One or other, or both, of the
lawyers declared that he or the other fellow,
or all of them put together, would regard
Miss Jenyrs as a granddaughter—we mean to
say a sister—even if it cst them all they were
worth, and just here we would warn Essie about
the danger of adopting a lawyer as a brother.
We have tried it more than ones and were cleaned
out every time. Lawyers are an oily and slip-
pery race, and if ever one proposes to Essie let
her insist that he does it on parchment, and see
that the document is witnessed, properly stamped,
and registered at the Deeds Office. Sir Alban
Riley said nothing all the time, andtfce beaming and
fatuous George Reid, the only man at the N.S W.
bar who can pay a compliment without making it
sound like a sentence of death and two floggings
of 75 lashes each, was kept In the background
while the ferocious Pilcher mooned along on the
road ih.t leadtth to the destructi'n of hurra i
patience. Miss J ;nyLB teplitd in a pretty
little well-acted speech, in the course of which
she expressed a hope that the London critics
would not be too hard on her, and provided Bill
Holloway doesn’t play Romeo we don’t think they
will. Bill’s Romeo would break a London audience
up, but he has promised to keep quiet and, as
much as possible, out of sight. A mlfguided
Sydney paper expresses a hope that our Erde
will come back in triumph, “like Beach," but for
our own part we trust fin will come back as
little like Beach as possible. When that aquatic
gentleman returned, he appeared on the stage of
Sydney Gaiety perspiring in an awful agony of
embarrassment because he didn’t know what to
do with his hands ; ha struggled aimlessly with
his feet, too, while Louise Davenport made a
charming little oration preparatory to a presenta-
tion, and when she attempted to take his hand,
she had to reach for the unresponsive William
three times amid the smothered shrieks of the
assemblage. If Miss Jenyns comes back like that
there will be more than one suicide. At prt sent, ac
cording to Plain Bill Hollow ay, she is 21 years of
is not engaged to be married, and doesn't mean to
marry for fire years. Why doesn’t William give
us something original? This dreary five-year busi-
ness was copyrighted by Mary Anderson and loaned

At Sydney Royal, “ La Fille du Tambour
Major” will give place on Boxing Night to
“ Robinson Crusoe." On Christmas Kve, “In the
Ranks ” will be produced at Her Majesty’s in suc-
cession to the high-faluting imbecility of
“ Siberia," and on Thursday evening, at tte same
theatre, one Hanlan, who couldn’t manage to pull
a boat so fast as he wanted the other day, is to
have a benefit under the patronage of Barren
Caring ton. “ Little Jack Sheppard" will be re-
vived at the Critericm on December 26tb, under
the management of Brough and BoncicauVt.
Christmas Kve, at this theatre, will be filled in
with a gorgeous production of “ Faust," with
Miss Elsa Sherwin, from Tasmania, as Mar-
guerite, The Gaiety is closed for a week, after an
interlude of that blood-curdling production, “ His
Natural L*fe," in the course of which Gab-
bett rubbed his cannibal stomach as of old,
but will re open on Christmas Eve wltti
a piece entitled “ The World Against Her.
For our own part, we are sorry to hear that the
world was against her, but we have no doubt
things were satisfactorily arranged at the end.
Mr. John L Hall starts a comedy season at the
Standard on Decsmber 21 ; Bill Holloway, who
well deserves a sand-off for his services
in bringing out Essie Jenyns, takes a
farewell benefit, in “ Ingomar,” on the 23rd
(Fiiday); and ore or two minor rows are also in
progress. The Ccogee Aquarium opens on Friday.
Like everything else, it will be under the patron-
age of Lord Carington.

Sydney Opera House is now held by
Frank M. Clark’s All-Star Company—a combina-
tion with many extenuating circumstances of
greater or less importance. The performance
opens with a farce, entitled “ The Two Macks,"
which seems to he a sort of universal dump for
the dead cats of comedy. It has neither begin-
ning nor end the characters are nothing in par-
fcular and come to nothing, and how they arrive
there nobody knows, Messrs. Frank M. Clark
and William Cameron play the parts of two par-
ticularly choice Irish drunks, and Miss Annie
Reel also heirs a lot, but they end nowhere.
Mademoiselle Garretta, however, makes a beauti-
ful show with her performing pigeons—the pret-
tiest and best trained gathering we have seen
since our grandfather was very yourg. Miss May
Cameron, a boneless lady with a face like
the countess of our dreams, puts eggs o»
her head and smashes them with her feet,
which she throws up behind while she stands
on nothing at all, ties herself up in knots,
or else makes her slender figure into a circle and
then jumps through it, and generally dnes the
human snake act in good style. Frank M. Clark
does a dismal policeman act with a dismal sorg ;
Wilson and Cameron get through some very good
tumbling, which is set off by a song explanatory
of the way the Norfolk Howard “ gets there all
the same;’’ and Messrs. Fields and Hanson’s musio
brings down the house. Lastly, Onda, the acro-
bat, goes through some really wonderful work on
the trapeze, though his performance is still a good
way behind that of Onzalo, whose flying leap
right across the theatre used to para’yse the
audiences at the Criterion. The house was
crowded on Saturday night, and will probably
continue so unless the attendance f alia off.
** * *
The vulgar herd of the pit and gallery did
not roll up to the Parkes Tribute matinee, given
at Her Majes y’s (Sydney) on, Saturday, but the
salt of the universe gathered in the circle and
did their best to look like a crowd. Miss Ess e
Jenyns and the Criterion Company perpetrated
the cathedral scene from “Much Ado About
Nothing ” to an audience which was hardly intel-
ligent enough to appreciate it as it deserved, and
George Rlgnold and h's followers ensuedi with
the second act of “My Partner," which made the
house bellow with applause. A musical perform-
ance followed, in which Miss Lucy Pinkstone,
Miss Rose Dampier -whoso, sweet TOice gives re-
newed promise that it will one da; make her
famous, and; M a Innes, and Messrs, Walehe,
Kowalski, Warner, and others did the'r best for a
shaky cause, and the total proceeds will keep
Parkes’ “ breadless home" supplied with hot rolls
for a little time to come,

Fred Maccabe walks the greasy plank of
popular favour at S, dney Academy with con-
tinued success, and grabs ihe curly tail of the pig
of popular app'ause every time. This finished
figure of speech is et Australian origin, and was
constructed in The Bulletin office. Tt e sweet
flowers of poetry grow best under the blue skies
of the Sunny South, and the language of the New
World has a richness and flowing rythm un-
known upon the effete and foggy shores cf Europe*
Mr. Maocahe’s melodramatic villain is still the
great attraction of the show, and he comes
on simultaneously as a heavy stage-ruffian and a
shrinking village maiden, and one half of him
goes down on her knees and begs for mercy,
while the other half utters fierce threats and
drags away the weeping victim, and a third half
—Mr. Maccabe is in three halves—rushes to the
rescue and tears himself away. This demoralised
condition of things hits the audience like a cricket-
ball.

There is nothing particularly pretty to say
about Melbourne shows this week, except that
they are affording delight to visitors from the

WHERE’S MY WIFE?
Not a drop of water ! The canteen was
empty ! The shadow beneath my horse was the
only patch of darkness on the blinding surface of
a boundless plain. High overhead blazed the
fierce and merciless sun. It was mid-day, and hia
beams beat straight down, smiting with whips of
fire the gasping, thirsty earth. Not a cloud in the
sky. The hot air danced and quivered like the
escaping fumes of a blast furnace. As the sweat
broke on my horse's hide it crusted there in git-
te’icg salt. Not a hut in sight, not even the
meanest little humpy. Not a drop of water any-
where. My tongue clove to the roof of my
mouth like a tongue of leather. Afar on the
verge of the plain gleamed the mirroring bosom
of a l>ke, en fringed with graceful palms—it was
the cursed mirage. Not a breath of air. Not a
sound save the ceaseless hum of the mesquito and
the panting of the poor beast that staggered along
in this hell’s heat beneath my weight. Here and
there, on the edges cf the crab-holes, the only
hollows in this almost level plain, were little
heaps of bleaching bones-the remains of water 1 -
famished flocks. Once and again, shone white
and weird in the fierce sun-haza the ghastly
of a bullock with wide-spreading horns. The
withered golden grass-spears flashed back the
pitiless sheen of the sun, while a steaming sky of
molten steel swam like a nightmare over the arid
scene.
* * *
Not a drop of water !—and miles upon
miles cf travel stretching out before me into the
wasted west. . . . But that distant fringe of
stunted box was surely no cheating vision. It
shows faint and mist-like far ahead, and yet?
Anotner weary half-an-hour and the
token looms larger. The nearing belt ol timber
lines a creek’s course 1 But what’s that, anyway !
All the creeks hereabout are long since dried up.
My horse’s powerless limp, weak as it is, crushes
beneath his hoof the brittle grass into a golden
prwder.
• * *
Nearer—and, by Jove ! there is water !
The grisly forma of starving cattle can bo made
out amongst the Btraggling!timber. They have
come hither to drink —and to die. . . ■ At
last! . . . Only a chain of stagnant water-
holes ringed round with putrid lines of dead fish
—each ring marking a day’s sucking up by the
hoi: sun of the priceless slime—water, save by un-
blushing lying, it could not be called. Steaming-
hot, thick, muddy, green ; fouled with the pollu-
tions of cattle, it reeked beneath the scorching sun-
light which hourly lapped it up with fevered
tongue, to hear away, and to shower down in the
form of pure rain-water on some other and dis-
tant part. These water-holes were made more
repulsive—if that were possible—by the rotting
bodies of young and weakly cattle which, urged
by burning thirst, had plunged into the mud, had
drunk their fill of the loathsome mess, and too
weak to get out again had died there. Yet, not-
withstanding, both horse and man swilled their
fill of the poison. Somewhat set up by onr drink
and a spell beneath the scanty shade cast by the
sparse foliage of the stunted box-trees, we
journeyed on once more, following the course of
what in rainy months was a swift and brawling
creek. Turning a sudden bend, we came at once
and without a moment’s warning, upon an adobe,
or mud-biick hut ; a real ledge in the vast and
arid wilderness, but a lodge that seemed to he
without a dweller. No watch-dog bayed either
a deep-mouthed welcome or an angry halt. No
smoke went up into the sky from the huge
earthen chimney. The clumsy, rough-hewn door
stood wide open upon its leathern hinges, and no
sound of man’s making broke upon the ear. One
or two milk-dishes and the Different vessels of
back-blocks cookery were scattered around the
doorway in careless disorder.
# * *
I got down from the saddle and went
towards the door. My horse, left to himself, wan-
dered aimlessly about amongst the pans of domes-
ticity, turning over with equine curiosity, and
sniffing with edacious yearning and expanded
nostril a battered bucket fragrant with the re-
miniscent perfume of an historic horse-feed. Be-
fore going into the hut I peered long, and per-
haps impatiently, through the glass of a show-
side of a lolly-tin stuck over a hole in a slab of the
wall by way of window. Eutthe inside gave no
more token of a dweller than the outside. I went
into the hut I
* *
After the dazzling glare of the sun, for
awhile I could see nothing plainly in the thick
gloom that filled the little cabin. By-and bye I
made cut a rude table and, helped by the bright
I'ght that beamed down the mouth cf the gaping
chimney, a couple of stools. I saw also that some
rough trouble had tean taken to brighten up the
walls and soften their barren look with prints cut
out of illustrated papers. The table, strewn with
feed and the dishes used in a meal; the white
ashes in the huge hearth, which had plainly burnt
out without anyore’s help; the kettle still hang-
iig by a chain fixed to a heavy cross-beam in the
chimney, a man’s coat flung carelessly across a
stool, a pair of hoots which had been thrown
down upon the floor, and the whole look of topsy-
turviress, hinted of flight or sudden and hurried
settle g forth on an errand of weight, A fowling-
piece, held by leathern slings, hung above the
mantel, and a saddle-rack, upon which rested a
saddle and bridle, was nailed over the doorway.
Notwithstanding all these things telling of a
man’s former livirg here, there were, too, traces
of a woman’s hand and a woman’s taste in the
lock of the little room ; and near the door a print
apron spoko loudly of the sex of one former
dweller.
• • •
But everything was so still —still as the
grave. A damp and uncanny quiet filled the
Place, and stifled me. . . . My eyes dropped
suddenly upon something which before this I had
not seen-a bunk in the. gloomiest corner of the
room. . . - Stretched upon this bunk there
wd3 t . . . My God! was it some porr
wretch, robbed and murdered here in this silent
desert ? The gruesome quiet of the place during
my keun look round the room for the past ten
minutes helped me to stifle a rule what the dread
that struggled up like a lump in my throat and
threatened to choke me, yet I felt a sickening
doi il-o to turn and fly from the eerie spot. . • .
I found that) I could move not a muaclo. That
mute and motionless form on the bunk in the
corner began to throw a spell upon me. It seemed
to call me to its tide with its cold, voiceless tongue.
An unseen finger seemed to beckon me across the
room.
• * *
Thrilled to my inmost heart, I obeyed the
ghostly call and walked against my will slowly
towards the stretcher.
* * *
The body was covered with a curtain of
some common cotton stuff, which clung with
rigid faithfulness to the outline of the hidden
thing. I felt that I was here alone with the
dead! . . . Long, long, I gazed down upon
the mystic curtain —how long I hardly know
following with wide-staring eye the lines of the
body beneath. I wondered, as men wonder in a
dream, what fearful eight was hidden by that
common cotton curtain. . . But I dared not
uncover the face of the dead
* * *
Jest at this high-wrought moment my
over-strung nerves got a great shock. My horse,
in his wanderings amongst the tin-pots and pans
outside in search of a feed, knocked a bucket off
the bench beside the door. The din and clatter of
that bucket rolling about amongst the milk dishes
and causing much clamour, sent my heart bound-
ing against my ribs —sent the hot blood tingling
into my cheeks and flushing my face, and then
flooding back again as quickly and making me
shiver as though a stream of icy cold water
flowed beneath my skin, as in the height of fever s
fierce delirium. All was quiet again. . . .
Another aching ten minutes of weak wondering
and dread of something—l knew not what. . .
By-and-bye, T plucked up courage to lift that
curtain. . . For a moment I hardly dared
look. . . When I did, I almost let it fall upon
the dead man’s face—a face turned upward with
great, glassy, staring blue eyes, looking fixedly
into mine—a white, bloodless face which must
have been wonderfully like my own at that
moment. Stubble of an unshaven beard added
somewhat to the ghastliness of his look, and a
trailing blonde moustache hung limp over his
pallid lips and down his blue cheeks, like a ship’s
pennant drooping at half-mast in memory of the
A BLUE MOUNTAIN INCIDENT.
HORSEMAN (loq.): “SAY! IS THIS THE WAY TO THE FALLS"

dead. That blonde moustache seemed a mockery
borrowed from the world of fashion to contrast its
paltry vanity with the awful process of decay.
He was a man of middle height, lithe and muscu-
lar in build. Good-looking he was. as good looks
go, and bearing on bis cold forehead a mark -that
strange brand of a life somewhere, different to the
life here -of having been for years in other than
Australian climes,
» * *
The pathos of the situation overcame its
grueaomeness. All fear left me. I looked down
on the dead man as one looks back upon a dream,
and framed for him in my mind the tale of his
life. Then I replaced the calico curtain which
served the purpose of a shroud, and, all my
terror fled, I busied myself with hunting for
feed for my horse. In the corner of the hut I
found a half-filled bag of chaff and corn, enough
to furnish forth a feed. After giving my horse
something to eat, I lighted a Are in the cold
hearth, and began to prepare my own meal, for
night had suddenly stolen on, and the sun was
just on the very edge of the far-stretching plain.
After I had eaten as much as I had a mind to, I
sat blinking into the fire as it slowly smouldered
into blackness, and the stars came out and looked
down the big chimney. As the night and the
mosquitoes thickened, I opened my “bluey,”
spread my blankets, and turned in,
* * *
I hardly know kow long I slept, but in
the midnight silence of that lonely place, when
the moon was beaming spectrally down the shaft
of the wide-mouthed chimney, and the stars were
glinting through the openings in the bark-rcof, I
| was awakeced by the sounds of men talking. I
[ drowsily turned over, and was soon asleep again
| - again to be awakened by the muttered tones of
I the human voice. There was no mistake about
it. A confused gabble, and then, sharp and clear,
was spoken out a word that sounded like damn,
followed by Voirao and stifl d cursing. I plainly
heard the human voice, now whispering as though
breathing a secret into another's ear, now croon-
ing and chattering in a low tone, as though talk-
ing to itself. . . • And, by Jove t there were
two voices. One was an English voice, and the
other spoke in German.
* • *
A.S I rapidly re-called the events of the
past day, a feeling as though I were bound in a
sheet dipped in icy water swept over me. My
hair stood stiff on my head with fright. In-
stinctively my eyes sought the bunk upon which
lay the dead man. . . My God !—could Ibe
mad?—the corpse seemed in the gloom to bo
sitting bolt upright upon his bier talking to a
black form with bright eyes, which my fearful
imagination pictured as a Teutonic devil 1 . .
I was wide awake now I
* * *
In the ledge above the fireplace I had
noticed a piece of candle. I fumbled about for
my breeches. I could not find them. I made
sure that I had thrown them over my feet. They
were not there. I groped about the floor. No 1
I had not kicked them off, My hand touched
something cold and slimy, and my skin broke out
afresh with another dread —a snake I I hunted
about in the darkness, tumbling over articles that
I had not before noticed. I could not find my
breeches. My shirt was drenched with sweat
which chilled at once on my skin. My teeth chat-
tered. It seemed ages and I could not find my
breeches. Suddenly I bethought me-I had
placed them under my head as a pillow. After
what to me was a painfully long time, I found
the pocket into which I had dropped a box of
matches. There were no matches there. Slowly
it dawned upon me that I had placed the matches
on the table before going to sleep. Then followed
another hunt in which I knocked over a lot of
things and my heart gave fearful bumps and my
pulse seemed to come to a standstill with every
little c’atter. In the midst of It all the corpse
began to talk angrily to his German fiend, who
as angrily answered him. I waa bathed, soaked
in a damp dread. But I got the matches at last,
and after another long and painful hunt I got the
“dip” also, Half-dazad with terror and wetly
cold, I made my way with the lighted candle in
my hand, through the spectral gloom of the cabin,
seeing ghosts in every corner, to the side of that
eldritch bunk.
♦ • *
The corpse was quiet, perfectly quiet
quiet as any other corpse would be. . . I must
have been dreaming—nightmare ! Nothing more
simple. Cursing my folly and my fears, and
wishing to Heaven that I had not eaten so much
heavy and halt-baked damper, I tried to make up
my mind to go back to bed. . . . But it was
of no use ! I could not. So I went outside,
patted and talked to my horse, then walked back
to the hut again, finished dressirg myself, and for
want of something batter to do, lighted a fire and
put the billy on Even eating was better than
doing nothing—when alone with a talkative
corpse. Bat when I tried to eat every mouthful
stuck in my throat and choked me. The unoan-
niness of the place, the presence of the corpse,
would have spoiled the best appetite and the most
sumptuous banquet the world ever saw or had
experience of.
* * *
Surely the voices were at it agam ! My
hair stood upright on my scalp. A cold flush
rushed over me, and seemed to cut my body off
from my skin. My tongue, too, got in the road,
and would not let me eat. The stupid thing stuck
to the roof of my mouth. I tried 10 speak—but it
was cf no use. . . . The sound was not re-
peated I It must have been a trick of the ima-
gination. Somewhat reassured, I raised a mo-
derate-sized piece of jerked beef to my mouth
. when suddenly a hand—a long, lean,
ghostly hand- descended on my shoulder 1 I saw
the blue hued, death-pallored nails distinctly.
A ghoul-like voice—a voice that seemed
to well up from the caverns of the dead—hissed
into my ear :

* • •
I gave a shriek that might have been
heard a mile away. I made a bound ihat would
have gained me immortal fame as an acrobat. I
kicked over the stool upon which I had bee n sit-
ting. With one frenzied leap 1 was into the In-
nermost recess of the chimney. I had shinned
up on to the cross-beam which served as crane.
All in a moment into which ages of agony seemed
crushed.
* * *
But I waa nob pursued ! I sat there on
that cross-beam till my limbs grew cramped and
stiff, till my head fell drowsily upon my bosom,
till at last I really slept. ... I fell with a
heavy fall into the ashes of the dead fire, and
picked myself out of them in a sort of dazed Con-
dition. Then I sat down on my blankets which I
had managed to find again. The candle bad long
ago burnt itself out. Mechanically I rolled lip
my swag and gathered my traps together. Just
as mechanically I carried them outside, saddled
my horse and made ready for a departure,
although it would be yet some hours before sun-
rise. But I could not leave without examining
that bunk. I groped my way across the little
cabin. I stretched out my hand—and almost
fainted. There upon the bunk still Jay the corpse
with the curtain still upon its face hardly a fold
out of order. This was too much. I dropped my
hand to my side and fell into a reverie. I waa
called back to earth suddenly. A grip was on my
arm, that voice hissed again in my ear: “Ah 1
Ah ! you ! Give me my wife ! Do you hear,
you devil, what have you done with my wife!
What the h have you don e with my wi'e f” With
that I bounded out of the hut, closely followed by
a scantlly-olad ghost, brandishing a stout cudgel
In the light of the low waning moon. In a
I had gained my horse and dashed off into the
fast-growing light of the dawn. Unconsciously I
turned off the oreek course on to the plain. I
glanced round I A shirted, cadaverous figuro
was leaping along the ground after me,
gesticulating widly, and waving above his head
that massive waddy. The breeze of coming
morning fanned my oheek, and swept upon my ear
the faint heard cry
“ Where’s my wife, you ? What the fa-
have you done with my wife ? ”
One evening, about
a twelvemonth after, I
was entering a bush
township at tfce close of
a hot summer’s day. I
drew up at the fl rst shanty
and jumped off my horse,
purposing to have a
drink. As I passed him
a man coiled up near the
door on the ground looked
up—it was the corpse.
I bade him gcod-day, and
Invited him to drink with
me, to which he readily
assented. In the course
of the evening, I got from
him his story. Upon the
morning of the day be-
fore that upon which I
had visited his hut he
was supposed to have
pegged out for the Golden
Shore. He was by birth
a German, but had lived
many years in Australia
and followed the life of a
boundry-rider; he had
long been ailicg of some
unknown sickness, Ne
one visited him, of course.
He lived with his wife,
almost on the edge of the
run, twenty miles or more
from the homestead.
When his wife supposed
him dead, she fled from
the place; in the first
place because she did not
care to be left alone with
a corpse, iu the second
to go to the home station
and bring back some one
to bury him. When she
came back, accompanied
by the super -[“ Who
was always sweet on
her,” he somewhat bit-
terly added] and a
couple of station hands,
they found him dancing
in delirium, and shouting
hoarsely for his wife.
He was rather dangerous
with a club in his hand,
bub they got hold of him
and took it away, and he
gradually became better
—in three days he was
quite well again. His wife
was very disappointed
to find he did not want burjlng, especially as the
amorous super., in the trip from the home station,
had taken advantage of his position to propose
himself as the suoce b t of the man they weie
en route to put under the daisies.
I a*ked : “ Where is your wife now, old man?"
“Up at the station, bossing everything, and
pretending the place belongs to her, I saw she
cared no more for me. The game was cut-throat
euchre, and her and the super, are partners. I
played a lone hand, so cleared out, and left my
stakes. Damn him and her both Ihe can have
her I’’
Christmas comes bub once a year. This is
oftener than Parkes’ insolvencies.
A new anecdote is now going the rounds
about von Moltke. It is related that the old Field
Marshal recently said: '* I have a presentment that
my life will not, as I should wish, close in peace.
In my youth It was foretold to me that I should
take part in three great wars. Whatever may
happen, let us all be ready to give our lives for
the German fatherland.”
The order of the London Chief Commis-
sioner of Police, designed to suppress the Trafal-
gar-Square gathering, was to the effect That
should a procession perambulate the streets, or
block the roadway, so as to interfere with traffic,
it is to be dispersed and the leaders arrested.
We notice that no such order is ever given on
Lord Mayor’s Day, The Sir Charles Warrens
and such never interfere with that horrible, re-
volting pageant of bedizened gluttony.


I called to Bee Tom, my old school-ehum. I found him
distracted, quite unlike his usual self. “Why, Tom, old
boy, what’s wrong?” “Harry, he answered, "Christmas is
upon us. I have a big bill to meet, and only this solitary
sovereign towards it.” " Cheer up, old boy, that won’t pay
the bill, but you can put it in ‘ Australia's’ Consultation on
Bummer Cup—You never know 1" "Capital! I will. Al-
ready I feel confidence in the spee., for I know the thing is
all square and above board."*
Among the many improvements we have noticed in the
city is that of the well-known and old-established Koyal
Hyde Park Hotel, corner of Bathurst and Elizabeth streets,
opposite Hyde Park, Sydney. The proprietor, Mr. M
Skalvby, has spared no expense to make his hotel the first

The Name of New South Wales.
AN IMPROMPTU ADDRESS TO MY SOUTHERN FRIENDS.
(Written for the EVENING NEWS .)
BY HENRY HALLORAN.
Wexe I a Victorian, I’d not give that name
For the name of another;
Of sister or mother; ,
But would make it eclipse, m the annals of fame,
The name of each other.
Tho’ crampt in extent, even down to a jest,
And pinched in our border,
No patriot marauder .
Should trouble its confines, nor dare to infest,'
Nor wreck with disorder.
What Athens and Sparta in old times have been—
Those day-dreams of glory—
Those splendors of story, . ..
I would strive to make her, the one bright Southern Queen
Shaming States that are hoary.
I’d not fight for straws, nor disparage my neighbour,
Who has right on his side,
And burns with the pride
Of his mighty success in the triumphs of labour ; ,
or stoop to deride.
It is better to be even smaller than Britain
With a power that springs
From tho people, and flings
A lustre wherever its name may be written ;
That its people are kings.
If a nation believe in the grandeur of Honor,
In the splendor of Right,
In the wisdom of Light,
She will march, with the blessing of Heaven upon her,
And a Right—that is Might.
Not so with a people, whatever their acres,
Their number, or wealth,
If they flourish by stealth,
Making faithful men slaves of their butchers and bakers,
Wrecks in poctet and health.
AN IMPROMPTU ADDRESS, BY A VIC-
TORIAN, TO THE POET HALLORAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
If / slung that slush I would not sign my name.
For the sake of my mother,
My sister and brother,
But would spare my relations a spasm of shame
By signing some other.
I 1 V e cramp In the stomach, and pains at the chest.
Through roaring out curses
Since reading those verses ;
If you sling any more, I would beg to suggest
You charter our hearses.
Does any one know what the dickens they mean i
For inanity splendid
(Now, don’t be offended)
They vie with that Jubilee Ode to the Queen
Which Tennyson’s pen did.
The Bible exhorts us to dote on our neighbour.
But a crime is a crime,
And fellows “ do time
Are frequently sentenced to terms of hard labour—
For less than that rhyme.
It is better to bo a big oat than a kitten ;
The mosquito it springs
On a victim and sings—
For myself, I admit I have often been bitten
By varmints with wings.
While a people can stand such ridiculous twaddle
In their Noose of a night,
It is evident quite
They will only progress at the rate of a toddle
To the wisdom of Light,
you are a sample of Parkes’ “ Australian,"
I withdraw every claim
To the family name,
And desire to be classed as an outcast and alien—
And we all say the same.
Peace!
“ Peace on the Earth. Goodwill to men,”
So sang the Angels bright
At the advent of the lowly child,
On that happy Christmas night,
Alas ! They but mock us now, as then.
Peace upon Earth I Goodwill to men !
Peace ! When the nations groan and cry
To the notes of horrid War ;
When the mother wild soothes her hungry child-
Peace! —For the starving Poor.
Peace I—While the jealous monarchs try
To be first to raise the battle-cry.
Peace !—When a million people plead
In vain for work or bread,
While in mansion bright with blazing light
Their “ Master” holds high his head!
Yet the Church will tell you, with satire keen,
He’s beloved by the lowly Nazareno.
Peace ! In Australia’s sunny land,
The land that was made for Peace,
Whose guardians treat with a foreigner’s fleet
Tying bonds that blood must release,
Peace I When Capital holds the soil
And laughs at the sighs of the Sons of Toil.
Ah ! When shall this war and tumult end,
And the spoiler stay his hand ?
When the monarch Gold is dead and cold
And Intellect rules the land —
When Birth gives place to Worth, we’ll then
See Peace upon Earth, Goodwill to men.

The increased duty on spirits has made
things awkward for the Sydney wine and spirit
merchants, some of whom complain that they no
longer send up-country any spirits worth speak-
ing of. It is pretty well known that most of the
grog sold in the interior of the colony is manufac-
tured by the publicans. There are several tolera-
bly private spirit-factories in active operation in
Sydney, which turn out, in particular, an excellent
and splendidly-packed imitation of Hennessy’s
brandy. Good back-blocks whisky is made this
year out of turpentine, kerosene, horse-blister,
ginger, pain-killer, Worcestershire sauce, and red-
pepper, with some wild-cat and circular-saw
thrown in; also a gas-light, a little real sheol-flre, a
dozen squashed bull-dog ants, and some fusel-oil.
There is a general impression out West that the
liquor Is better than it used to be, but the best
brand of all is kept at a bush shanty on the Dar-
ling, where the owner kicked a live monkey into
the whisky-cask and left it there six weeks.
GOLDEN GULLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No one lives in Golden Gully, for its golden days
are o’er,
And its clay shall never sully blucher-boots of
diggers more.
For the diggers long have vanished—nought but
broken shafts remain,
And the bush, by diggers banished, fast reclaims
its own again.
Now, when dying Daylight slowly draws her fin-
gers from the “ Peak,”
The WeirdKmpressMelancholy rises from the reedy
creek—
In the gap above the gully, while the dismal cur-
lews scream
Loud to welcome her as ruler of the dreary night
supreme -
Takes her throne, and by her presence fills the
strange, uncertain air
With a ghostly phosphorescence of the horrors
hidden there.
None would think, by camp fire blazy, lighting
fitfully the scene,
In the seasons that are hazy, how in seasons gone
between,
Diggers yarned or joined in jolly ballads of the
field and foam,
Or grew sad and melancholy over songs like
“ Home, sweet Home ”
Songs of other times, demanding sullen tears that
would not start,
Every digger understanding what was in his com-
rade’s heart.
It may seem to you a riddle how a poet's fancies
roam,
But methinks I hear a fiddle softly playing “Home,
Sweet Home ”
’Mid the trees, while meditative diggers round the
camp-fire stand.
(Those were days before Australians learned to
love their native land.)
Now the dismal curlew screeches round the shafts
when night winds sought ;
Startling murmurs, broken speeches, shake each
twisted, tangled bough,
And whene’er the night comes dreary, darkened
by the falling rain,
Voices, loud and dread and eerie come again and
come again—
Come like troubled souls forbidden rest until their
tales are told—
Tales of deeds of darkness hidden in the whirl of
days of gold—
Come like troubled spirits telling tales of dire and
dread mishaps,
Kissing, falling, rising, swelling, dying in the
dismal gaps.
When the coming daylight slowly lays her fingers
on the “ Peak”
Then the Empress Melancholy hurries off to
swamps that reek.
But the scene is never cheery, be it sunshine, be
it rain.
For the Gully keeps its dreary look till darkness
comes again.
As you stand beside the broken shafts, where grass
is growing thick;
You can almost hear a spoken word, or hear a
thudding pick;
And your very soul seems sinking, foetid grows
the morning air,
For you cannot help believing that there’s some-
thing buried there.
There’s a ring amid the saplings by a travelling
circus worn,
That amused the noisy diggers e’er the rising race
was born ;
There’s a road where scrub encroaches that was
once the main highway,
Over which two rival coaches dashed in glory
twice a day;
Gone—all gone from Golden Gully, for its golden
days are o’er.
And its clay shall never sully wheels of crowded
coaches more.
December, 1887.
HUNKY LAWSON.
Suppression, Suppression, Suppression !
Right through, the classes hold together. They
will sink all differences, differences of party,
differences of person, for that. The Australian
Press is in the hands, not only of the classes, but
of the rich among the classes, and the Australian
Press will hear nothing that smacks of the Repub-
lican or the genuinely Australian. There is no
conspiracy ; oh, no ; there is no conspiracy I only—
we may have columns and columns of greasy
“Imperial Federationism,” whether from some
stupid rhetorogue of a Premier, or from some
played-out British Peer on his travels; but we
shall die of old age before we hear anything on
the other side. The popular feeling Is too pro-
foundly indifferent or hostile to allow the “Im-
perial Federationism ” to be rammed home with
the editorial ram-rod in the shape of leaders ; but
the columns of the daily press are always open, to
any amount of it, and closed to anything of the
reverie. Chief Justice Higinbotham is a man
more truly distinguished, and more truly worthy
of being distinguished by Australians, than any
of the hucksters who make up our roll of the
most contemptible politicians in the world. He is
a man whom no breath of slander ever touched,
whose hands were ever clean, whose heart and
soul were ever at the service of his country with-
out demur or afterthought. He passed from
politics with the simple commendation of all good
men. Nor Is this all. Judge Higinbotham,
viewed from the intellectual side, is as vastly
superior to the flatulent crowd of Berrys, and
Stuarts, and Parkeses (whose name is also
Sharkeses !) as he is from the moral side. All
this is common knowledge. Of late years,
since his virtual retirement from public life to the
distinguished shades of the Bench, we have heard
CT/cicEr
Ta si ffcsz/ti
the Judge’s voice but too rarely. “ The politician,’
alas I“ we have always with us.” Well, lately,
at one of the Melbourne gorges-ctm-rubbish
gabbles offered to that frightfully commonplace per-
son, Lord Carnarvon —a man who never
would have been heard of at all if he had not
happened to have a well-known title and a well-
ffiled purse—the dead-dog politicians (among
whom Carnarvon holds a proud place) were
let loose on the old “ Imperial Federation ”
racket. There was nothing new to say, and the
whole crew was too far dull a one to dress the old
stuff up in a new fashion. Then the eloquent and
incorruptible Higinbotham— the only Australian
Chief Justice who has spurned an English title—
arose. What happens ? All the old dead dog is
retailed in the daily papers by the yard, and the
ell and the mile and the league. The imbeciles
have a gala-day. But Higinbotham's speech is
so small, so thin, that we wonder he took the
trouble to speak at all. Then the secret oozes out,
Higinbotham spoke at length, refuting, attack-
ing the former speakers. Tout s'explique!
There has been an expression of Australian
feeling, perhaps even of Australian Republican
feeling. The papers ignore it, suppress it
How disgusting 1 Thus is dead dog ladled out to
us in unlimited soup, and we are told—damn our
optics—to take that or nothing. We take the
nothing. No one reads these stupid speeches, not
the men who make them. Bub is not disgusting,
indeed, all this ? There is no conspiracy ; oh no,
there is no conspiracy to suppress national and
Republican speech; only those alone who
hear it know it has been uttered, and the Press
does this. Long live Imperial Federation that
propagates itself thus 1 Long live the Democratic
Australian Press that helps it as much as it dare I
They now call him Angus De Cameron.
There is one place the bailiff dare nob
enter —the N.S.W. Colonial Secretary’s office.
The papers report that “some relics of
Captain Cook are now lying at the Colonial Secre-
tary’s Office, Sydney." Lying is a good word,
A Newcastle, N.S.W., policeman has
been charged with getting drunk on duty. Aa
there's a duty on beer, there should be beer on
duty.
THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W
Ihe Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only pape which has a con-
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
Democracy as the Australian National Creed.
Payment of Members.
State Revenue derived diiectly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education,
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
Protection to Native Industries.
The Election by the Australian peoples of the
Governors of the Australian colonies.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles,
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
Tim public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it p«s-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerfu
influence and its unprecedented literary and com
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news
paper.
Ihe Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form—printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress : it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege—the direct cause of
half the misery which now devastates British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact —easily ascertainable from any postal
official —that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-wi'itten reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

THE
COFFIN CLUB
WRITTEN FOR THE BULLETIN
By D
The average reader may consider this a
rather gloomy subject to be treated of in these
columns. He may imagine that it is hardly the
kind of thing likely to cheer him up after the
cares of the week when he returns from church on
Sunday and settles himself comfortably down,
with his pipe—and whatsoever liquid accompani-
ment he fancies—to read The Bulletin. But
there he will be wrong. It is a popular error that
undertakers go about wrapped in an atmosphere
of woe ; that they are clothed with sorrow as
with a shroud ; and that they sit up late driving
the dismal nail into the sad pine-shell, and weep-
ing as they work, while other me a are abed,
dreaming of good times to come, or listening to
the chimes at midnight and passing round the
cheerful bottle. The purpose of the present sketch
is to eradicate this error and picture the under-
taker.as he is, with all his gay good-humour and
merry spirits, his light-heartedness and contempt
of care. There may be some undertakers who do
not answer to this description—some who, begin-
ning with an honest intention to do their duty
thoroughly, have carried out their solemn simula-
tion of sorrow to such an extent as to have be-
come as mournful as the popular imagination con-
siders the whole class to be. It there are I have
not met them. Nearly all of those I have met
should have been editors of comic papers. Happy
thought ? —Perhaps the editor of this paper should
have been an undertaker ! Happy after thought!
—Perhaps he has been one.
* * *
When I was editing a New South Wales
country paper, five years ago, I wrote —at the
request of the owner—an elegy upon a poley-oow
that had fallen down a pit and broken her neck.
It was printed on slips for private circulation only,
but somehow or other the proprietor of the rival
paper got hold of it and published it in full with a
running commentary of sarcastic eulogy, intimat-
ing that when it came to real high-class metrical
mourning no elegiac poet that ever lived could
come within blocks of me, and hinting that I could
not have poured such a passion of grief into my
verse if the deceased had not been one of my near
female relatives —probably my aunt. This gloomy
badinage was taken in earnest by the simple
rustics of the district, and from that time forth I
waded chin-deep in woe. Everybody who had
anything dead came to me to have the fact notified
in rhyme and published in the paper. Some of
them were easily pleased ; some were not. Some
were contented with an allusion to the good quali-
ties of the deceased, and an expression of hope
that he or she was having a better time on high ;
others wanted a whole inventory of virtues with
weeping willows, sobbing survivors, harps and
crowns, and a general family gathering on the
Golden Shore thrown in. It came to such a pitch
at last that I had to leave. But the dismal
reputation I had made followed me. I had only
written for this paper two or three times when the
editor called me into his office and, pointing to a
chair, said, 44 Sit down.” I did. “A cigar?”
44 Thanks. Yes.” “Whis ” and his head went
under the desk, but was suddenly drawn back
again. He looked me hard in the eye for a
moment, and then—muttering to himself, 44 He
seems sober, perhaps he won’t,” —said aloud,
“Whisky?” “No, thank you,” I replied with
dignity ; 44 1 never touch it.”
44 Thank God,’ he murmured, 44 maybe this one
will last through the summer,” Then, throwing
one leg over the other, and revealing a boot with
an iron spike in the toe, he began to talk
rapidly.
44 Can you write mock elegiacs—something that
will bring the reader to the verge of tears, and
then suddenly pull him up and knock him back-
wards into spasms of rib-splitting laughter ?”
44 Can you do this ? ”
I answered modestly that I did not know I
could do all that, but I would try.
44 Um !” he said shortly, “ Here are two things
for you to start on. One, as you will see, con-
cerns the reverend gentleman who died of indi-
gestion, the other has to do with the demise of a
prize pig.”
* * *
I took up the paragraphs with a trembling
hand, and was preparing to withdraw, when he
said, taking out his watch and gazing earnestly at
it—as I thought, to see if it was real — 44 1 want
the copy in two hours.” Then he plunged into an
article on the absurdity of Freet r ade between the
planets, and I tottered out of the door broken-
spirited and miserable, and with just enough rea-
son left to give an 1.0. U. to the accountant, and
get it reluctantly cashed. As I was doing this I
beard a hiccup in the upper register close behind
me. Turning round I saw a being in a plug
hat with blue rings round his eyes which were
fixed in a fascinating stare on the coin that still
lay on the counter. Taking it up hastily I thrust
it into an inside pocket, and then basely pretend-
ing to recognise him for the first time, said, with
bold mendacity : 44 So it’s you, eh ? Well, this
beats everything. Why, I didn’t know you. How
are you, old fellow ? ” He replied with another
hiccup that blew his hat over his eyes that he was
pretty well, but not too well. Something the
matter with his liver, I think he said. IS is not of
much consequence, anyhow, for he had a lot of
names for the one complaint, I knew at once that
I had to do it, so I did it with a good grace, and
taking him by the arm whispered in his ear,
“ Come down to the corner.” It was beautiful to
see the change that came over his face then. It
was transfigured—beatified. And all by a whis-
per. Well, we passed the flagon round for a
while, and then I recollected what I had to do,
and told my trouble to my ring-eyed friend
44 Pooh ! ” he said, 44 That’s nothing. Give me
two or three slips of paper, and I’ll fix it up for you
in five minutes.” I handed them to him, and hav-
ing ordered 44 the same again ” went out on the
quay and watched the captain of the Watson’s Bay
steamer clenching his teeth and, after taking one
last look at the land, telling the engineer in tones
of desperate calm to go ahead, and then b-acing
himself together, gripping the wheel, and slowly
passing out of sight—a noble example of heroism
and devotion to duty.

When I returned the elegy was finished.
44 There,” said my friend, 44 1 think that ought to
do.” I just glanced at it, and then folded it up
and put it in my pocket. He was one of the poets
of the staff, and I felt that it would be presump-
tuous for me to suggest improvements on any-
thing he had done, so I nodded to the vision of
Beauty behind the bar, and once more replenished
the bard. Then I left him and hurried up to the
office. The editor was not in, so I put the copy
on his desk, and departed with a light heart,
When I returned in the afternoon I was informed
he wanted to see me. I went into his office. He
was fingering the elegy my friend had written
For the first time I noticed that each slip was
splashed with rum. The smell of them pervaded
the whole building. The editor had not noticed
me come in, and I heard him say to himself with
a sigh : 44 1 am again deceived. I did think this
man would have lasted through the summer.
But this rum-sodden drivel Then he saw
me. With a look conveying more of sorrow than
anger he handed me the manuscript, and said
merrily: 44 What do you call this?” I took it
and read the following :
HIC JACET.
The Parson and the Pig.
O come and dance a doleful jig !
Here lie the Parson and the Pig.
The Parson was a man of size.
He ate the Pig—and here he lies.
His hat it had a curly brim,
He now rips out the rolling hymn;
The Pig it was a pig of prize,
It met the Parson—here it lies.
But, as the Parson ate the Pig
(Skip round and dance a doleful jig !),
It follows, as the moon the sun,
That Pig and Parson now are one.
And, sure as six and one are seven,
That pious Pig is now in Heaven.
The pig it had a curly tail
(O come and raise the cheerful wail!);
That curly tail wag« here no more,
It wags upon the Golden Shore.
It whisks around in Kingdom Come—
(l wish I had another rum !)
And so, as I before have said,
The Parson he is very dead.
Let him, O Lord— this is no chaff!—
A harp play, or at least a fiddle ;
He measured three feet round the calf, ,
And ninety inches round the middle.
He walked along the narrow way,
So hallelujah, and hooray !
My knees smote together as I read this
monstrous bosh. The editor surveyed me in
silence for a moment, and then said, kindly
enough, all things considered : 44 Young man, let
this be a lesson to you. You are now, in the
words of the poet, starting to walk upon ambi-
tion’s diamond ridge, and if you wish to keep
your balance you had better give up all ideas of
carrying a cargo of rum to the other end. The
golden rule of literature is —However you go to
bed always get up sober— and if you cannot do
this at the first try wait till you can, if you
have to wait for a week. Good day! ” I went
out dejectedly, and feebly tried the cashier once
more to find that it was a ghastly failure.
* * *
After this I got into the way of writing
obituary verse of a grotesque and grisly orders
and thenceforth my fate was sealed. Did a
man hang himself under peculiarly droll circum-
stances— as the editor understood them—such, for
instance, as having a bottle of brandy unopened
in one pocket and eighteenpence in the other, I
was pitched upon to record the fact in verse dis-
mal enough to encourage everybody who read it
to go and do likewise. Was a skeleton found in
cellar—a skull turned up in digging the founda-
tions of a Life Assurance Society—a coffin dis-
covered near a picnic ground—l had to celebrate
the occurrence in lugubrious rhyme. Life has be-
come a burden to me since then. Here is a speci-
men of the sort of letter I am getting every
week; —
41 Dear D——. —Here is something that will suit your
humour. You can theorise grimly as to what purpose that
coffin was intended for —picture the man in the act of mak-
ing it by stealth at midnight—throw in some eerie effects,
and—but it is unnecessary to tell you any more. You will
revel in the subject."!
This is the paragraph alluded to :
“ On Saturday last, says the Goulburn Herald, some
boys playing in the bush near the Jews' cemetery found a coffin
hid in the sand. The discovery appears not unnaturally to
have alarmed them, and in reporting it to the police they
stated that at night the coffin emitted light as if it con-
tained a corpse. The police went out and took possession of
it, but on being opened it was found to contain nothing but
a two-foot rule.’
PM
y K p E.fe;
This was a cheerful thing to have to write
of—a nice subject to revel in. What could any
body say about it but that some heaven-born
undertaker had tried his hand at making a coffin,
and having succeeded had left it in the bush
while he went off to look for a corpse ? The only
other theory would be that some spirited corpse,
having found that he was too much crowded by
his neighbours, and having measured out with a
two-foot rule what he thought was his due amount
of room, and being refused that much, shouldered
his coffin, marched out of the cemetery, shaking
the bone-dust off his feet, threw the coffin with
the two-foot rule in it over the fence, and then—
after inquiring whether there was an election on
or not, and receiving a reply in the negative—
went away and drowned himself. But in any case
what sort of a thing was this to send to an oc-
casionally sane person to write about? Yet it is
airy and gay to what I have had given me as
44 congenial subjects” from time to time. The effect
of a continuance of this sort of literature would
have probably been to drive me to an early retire-
ment among the dead I had to write so much
about if it had not been for the cheering-up I re-
ceived from the merry mutes and undertakers
with whom I came in contact while in pursuit of
my dreadful calling. I soon got to know them all,
and to fasten upon the conclusion that Minstrels
are the most mournful, and coffin-makers the
cheeriest types of mankind,
* * *
Take the festive Quirby as a specimen of
the latter class. Where would you find such a
bubbling spring of humour—such a fountain of
fun—such a stream of rollicking Rabelaisian
drollery, as welled from him ? I would reward
with untold rum the man who could tell me where.
Quirby ! As I write his name—though now we
are far apart, and I may never have the happiness
of being packed by him in my little “piner” and
bowled out to my last residence by one of his j ocular
assistants—l can see him standing before the door
of his establishment, his thumbs fixed in the arm-
holes of his waistcoat, his plug hat, with the huge
crape band of the trade round it, stuck jauntily
askew, one eye half-closed and the other—a blood-
stone coloured eye—cocked in a spirit of humor-
ous speculation at the passers-by. There were
few who could stand the glance of that eye, albeit
a mirthful one, without momentarily repenting of
their sins and immediately afterwards plunging
into the nearest bar for a 44 stiffener.” I have
heard him on such occasions mutter to himself
44 so many stiffeners—make a stiff ’un.” Then he
would smile a smile that was gruesome to see and
invite me into his office to accelerate my own
decease with a “stiffener” of the same descrip-
tion—an invitation I can cheerfully say I have
never refused. The bottle, I may remark, was
always kept in a coffin, from which, with a
thorough enjoyment of the grotesqueness of the
proceedings, he would draw out the glasses and
ask me to drink “A blessed resurrection ” to the
expected occupant. He was a wag, I can tell
you. With what child like pleasure, too, he
would point out to me the various sorts of funeral
furniture strewn around—he sitting on a coffin on
trestles, and dangling his legs the while I 44 That,”
he would say, indicating a shell in the corner, 44 is
what we call a common-piner. It provides merely
for the necessities of a corpse. Those who choose
to be buried with extras are packed in one like
that over there - that’s a rose-wooder with German-
silver mountings, and a very snug shell, too, at
the price ; though if you want real comfort, com-
bined with elegance, you must go for a cedar-
one like that on the shelf opposite—-and if you re-
quire right-down luxury you must get a leader.
O jly rich people can afford thrse. There is more
joy in an undertaker's shop when a rich man dies
than when 99 poor people shuffle off the coil!”
But Quirby, though gay and genial, always
laboured to elevate his trade to the level of a fine
art, and was ever thinking of the comfort of his
customers. He was always inventing something
or other new for their benefit. I remember his
showing me a coffin with a sliding lid, by means
ot which a person who was screwed down while in
a trance and happened to have the good luck—or
bad, as it might be—to wake out of it on his way
to the cemetery, could get up, pull the check-
string (always to be found in Quirby’s hearses),
and tell the driver to stop at the nearest hotel, or
he low until he got to his destination, and then
paralyse his weeping widow (if any) and mourning
heirs by a sudden resurrection. There is much
humour in the idea, but I believe this kind of
coffin is not popular with widows, as a rule. It
was Quirby, too, who advocated —and, in fact
originated the plan of putting a pipe down
through the grave, the end of it above ground, to
take the shape of a speaking-trumpet, and the
end below to be fixed exactly above the mouth of
the corpse. By this means he considered that a
person buried alive would (especially if he had a
few sandwiches and a bottle of whisky put in the
coffin previous to screwing down) be able to give
notice of the fact that he still had a vote—[No-
thing very curious about that. Complete corpses
have had votes in this country ere now. —Ed. 8.l
Of course while they were digging him out he
could be fed through the pipe. “ Great Moses !”
Quirby would say in his enthusiasm when expatiat.
mg on this subject, “ how would a bottle ot beer
taste at the bottom-end of that pipe after a three-
days’ thirst ? Why, it would be worth being dead
that- length of time just to try it!
* * *
He told me a story on one occasion, con-
cerning this, to the effect that he had buried a
man, and, to gauge the virtue of the idea, had
fixed one of these pipes into his grave. Quirby
came day after day to the tomb, and placed his
ear to the pipe to try if he could hear anything
from the gentleman below. He did this for
nearly a week, and at the end of that time began
to despair of success, as far as that corpse was
concerned, when a happy thought struck him.
The next time he went out he took with him a
bottle of Queensland rum, and slowly poured it
down the tube, leaving time for the party at the
other end to catch his breath —if he had any
By thunder, sir,” said Quirby, impressively, yet
with a twinkle in his eye, “ do you know what
happened then ? ” “ No." “ Well, I laid my ear to
the pipe, and may I never live to laugh at my own
funeral if I wasn’t struck with a hiccup that
knocked me like a ninepin over the next grave I
It wasn’t a hiccup—it was a kick, and I couldn’t
get the sound of it out of the drum of my ear for
a month afterwards. When I had recovered my-
self and given the party underneath time to sober
up a bit, I put my mouth to the pipe and called
down, 4 Hi, below there. Are you tired of being
buried yet ? ’ 4 Who the deuce are you ? ’ was the
staggering reply I received. 4 Never you mind,’
I said, 4 1 have come here to dig you up.’ 4 How
long have I been dead?’ ‘You’ve been dead
nearly a year,’ I answered (out of revenge for the
hiccup), 4 are you going dug up, or not ? ’ 4 1
want to ask you a question first ? ’ 4 Well, what
is it?’ 4 Is John Davies still alive?' 4 Very
much alive,’ I replied. 4 Then if he is I’m gointr
to stay where I am. You can fill your darned
pipe up ? ’ ”
* •
It was through Quirby I became intro-
duced to the Coffin Club. I shall never forget
that night. It was a sort of gdla night, and the
members were in full feather. Quirby led me
down a long, low-arched passage which I momen-
tarily expected to open out into a vault. Then
he suddenly stopped before what seemed to be a
huge black door. “What can this mean?” I
thought, with a sudden sinking in the pit of the
stomach— 44 Am I going to witness one of those
grisly and unhallowed revels, dimly hinted at in
that rare old black-letter book, 4 The History of
the Ogres,’ or have I come to assist at a gathering
of ghouls or a Witches’ Sabbath ?” These thoughts
rushed through my brain, falling over each other
in their hurry to get out. Thoughts come to me
so fast sometimes that I have to wrap my head up
in wet towels and read the morning papers to
drive them away. But that is neither here
nor there. While I was thinking, Quirby was
knocking at the door—three slow, dismal raps,
like the knocking at the gate in “Macbeth,” end-
ing with one dull thud, like that made by the fall-
ing of clods on a coffin, 44 Who comes here to
disturb our solemn mysteries?” said a hollow
voice from inside. 44 A Friend of the Worm in
the Mould,” replied Quirby, without a quaver in
his tones. 44 What is the password, Friend of the
Worm?” said the Hollow Voice. “Speed the
Hearse,” replied Quirby in undaunted accents.
“Enter,” said the Hollow Voice, swinging open
the door. I expected to find that the janitor was
a skeleton, or a vampire at the least,-so you can
judge of my surprise to see a little fat man with a
round, red face, and two of the merriest eyes!
have ever beheld twinkling in a human head. His
title, Quirby subsequently informed me, was
Keeper of the Dolorous Door. Quirby’s own title
in the Club was The Grinning Ghoul. Such dismal
denominations were surely never borne by two
such men before.
* • •
My first surprise on beholding the janitor
was nothing to that which I felt on finding myself
in a brilliantly-lighted room, down the middle of
which a long table ran. On each side of this
table were seated a number of gentlemen, each
with a full glass in front of him, and a pipe in his
hand. The President had not yet given the word
to 44 Light up and liquor,” before which, accord-
ing to the rules of the club, no member was per-
mitted to either smoke or drink. Quirby here in-
formed me in a whisper that he was about to
introduce me to the President, and that I must
address that dignitary as The Conqueror Worm.
He then led me up the room, and, after bowing
low to the President (whose seat, by the way, was
on a raised dais ac the top of the table), addressed
him thus: 44 Most mighty Conqueror Worm,
victor over all things that have breath, thou who
makest sieves of the mortal parts of kings, and
old cullenders of the bodies of aldermen, 1 would
to thy terrible and gruesome presence introduce
one who would see behind the Veil and know
what may be known of the awful secrets of our
order.” Then he led me forward and whisper-jd
me to do as he had done. So I bowed profoundly
to the Worm in the chair—a personage, by the
way, chiefly remarkable for a nose in the last
stages of purple, and eyes that seemed to literally
ooze out good-humour and gin—and, as far
as I could remember, went through the same
formula of address Quirby had used. During
this time the members sat as still and stolid
as two rows of tombstones. “Advance!”
said the Worm. I advanced 44 Kneel! ” I knelt.
“ Bring me the Hollow Skull.” It was brought
him by an assistant ghoul. I looked at it and
shuddered. It was a plaster cast of the human
head, but where there should have been eye-
sockets two phosphorised panes that gleamed


limoniacially were inserted. “Place it on the
■ad of the aspirant!” It opened at the back by
spring, but it was too small for me, A buzz of
tonishment ran down the two rows of tomb-
ones. “ What a monstrous head!” said one in a
ud whisper. “ What a skull for a Pantomime,
iid another. “ Not a skull, but a tank, ob-
■rved a third. “ Silence!” cried the President,
bring his hat ” Someone brought it. “ Make
hole in the crown! ” said the Worm. They did
-with a chisel—and it was a new plug hat, too.
Now cut a sheet of glazed paper, to fit inside
le hat, and gum it all round inside half-way be-
ween the crown and the rim.” This also was
one. “ Now bring me a pot of beer.” It was
rought. “ Put bis hat on.” It was done. The
'resident then advanced towards me brandishing
thigh-bone. “ Close your eyes,” he cried in a
ommanding voice, and I closed them. The next
mment the thigh-bone came crashing on the
rown of my new plug, and I was half suffocated
n a torrent of tanglefoot. “ Arise Drunken
ikull, for by that name shalt thou be henceforth
mown among us,” exclaimed the Worm. I arose
vith my face streaming with beer, and smelling
ike a vaL “Go into the next room and fix your-
elf up, old fellow,” sa d the President dropping
ds dignified manner ; “ the ceremony was neces-
iary or I wouldn’t have performed it, I assure
mu. Don’t be long, for the boys are waiting to
jegin business.” I wasn’t long, and when I re-
urned the President gave the orders to Light
ip and Liquor.”
* * *
Fifty matches were struck, 50 pipes began
■o fame, and 50 hands lifted 50 glasses to 50
mouths simultaneously (I know there is a slight
suggestion of the Baron of Grogzwig and his
Lincoln Greens in this phrase, but Dickens is dead
and won’t complain, and he is the only person really
interested). Each man emptied his glass at a
draught. I never saw such terrible fellows to
drink. They drank long beers, too, but I had had
enough of that beverage for a lifetime, and con-
tented myself with whisky, for which I could see
I was looked upon as rather a funny creature, after
all. The drinking-vessels they used were pint-
mugs of a somewhat gaudy pattern. I had ex-
pected to see a certain play of grotesque fancy in
the paraphernalia of the table —dishes made out
of shoulder-blades, tobacco jars out of skulls, &c.,
and looked forward to hearing quite a number of
picturesque remarks such as this : —First member
to second ditto; “ Where’d you get that long clay
you're smokin’ ?” 2nd member Guess.” Ist
member : “ Can't. Give it up.” 2nd member .
“ Well, you remember old Brown that died a
good many years ago—lived at Potts Point, you
know?” Ist member; “Yes. Well?’ 2nd
member : “ Well, I had to open his vault about a
month ago to put in a new lodger, and I found his
coffin burst and full of bone-dust. Made this pipe
out of it.” But I didn’t hear any such
remarks, and on mentioning my disappoint-
ment to Quirby he informed me that it
was a stringent rule of the club that nothing
made out of mortuary remains or suggestive of
the grave should be allowed in the club-room,
with the exception of the Hollow Skull and the
President’s Thigh-bone Baton, which were the
club regalia. Members, however, might talk as
much as they pleased about the tomb and all con-
cerning it. I subsequently found, as will be seen,
that they talked of nothing else.
* ** *
A long droll-visaged shell-builder on my
right was talking across the table to a jovial-
-1 loking party in the same line. “ How’s busi-
ness ?’said the former. “ Oh, nothin’to brag
about,” was the reply. “ I’ll tell you what it is ”
('eaning over and speaking in an impressive
whisper) “ people are getting too d d healthy.
If we don’t 'ave a heppydemic soon some of us ’ll
have to shut up shop and take to rabbit-catchin
for a livin’. And what’s the reason, eh ?’’ ( He
was a little man, and a bellicose) “ Well it's be-
cause o’ that d d Board o’ ’Blth,andits sanitary
hinspeotore, pryin’ and spyin’ around, and rootin’
up backyards and so on, where fever-germs are
multerplyin’ for our benefit. I call it takin the
bread out of a man’s mouth, I do. Why, them
I backyards and things is as good as hoyster-beds to
us. They’re our livin’. You might as well go
and root up a man’s garden, and call it justice, as
to root them up on us.” He was just getting
wound up, and would have probably gone on in
this strain for an hour longer if he had not been
interrupted by a guffaw from a third grave-filler.
“ The Board o' Elth,” said this one in tones of de-
rision, “ for all the ’arm the Board o’ ’Elth does
our business it might be constitooted entirely of
men in the trade.” “ But what’s the use of ’avin
a repperesentative in Parlyment if he don’t rep-
pore sent us ? ” exclaimed a fourth. “ What’s the
use of Ninny Melville to us I’d like to know ? Has
he ever riz his voice in the ’Ouse agin’ the quaran-
tine laws ? No. Not he. He sits there mum as
a mute and sees a ship-load o’ cholery (cornin’
right to our doors) quarantined. Why, it ’ud a
b;en a perfect godsend to us—we’d a made our
fortunes over it if it adn t been for
them ’orrid quarantine laws. I’m done with
Ninny Melville from this out ” The sentiments
conveyed in this speech evidently hit the taste of
his audience, for he sat down amidst a loud buzz
lof applause. The silence following this was
broken upon by the tomb-supplier on my left, who
addressed a friend a few coffin-builders’ distant,
“I hear,” said he, “ that you’ve had an outbreak
of typhoid fever in your part of the town. You
always had the luck of it.” “ Yes,” complacently
replied the party addressed ; “ I can’t complain
Business has taken a turn for the better with me
lately. How are you doin’ ?” “ Nothing much,”
answered the first speaker, despondently; “I’m
just managin’ to rub along on diptheria, measles,
’oopin-korf, and that kind o’ thing—but then, you
know, there’s no profit worth speakin’ about in
hinfants’ funerals, still ” (brightening up) “we
must always ’ope for better times.” Any further
conversation of this kind was
rendered impossible by the
President rapping his desk
with the official thigh-bone
and calling out, “Silence for
Coffin-Face’s song.”
• * *
Glasses were replenished,
pipes re-lit, and Coffin-face
(a gentleman of hilarious as.
pent) began to warble a melody, the first verse of
which ran as follows
THE MERRY COFFIN-MILLS.
(Air : “ Cruiskeen Lawn."
Let the squatter praise his runs,
The goat-warriors their guns.
The mariner his green fields of foam,
But we, more blest than they,
Chase the ’appy ’ours away
In our merry lit le coffin-mills at ’ome,
In our merry little coffin-mills at ’ome.
Chorus.— Merry little coffin-mills
(Merrily the grave-yard fills!),
Merry little coffin-mills,
Drink! Drink! Drink!
h very undertaker swills —
Drink!
The conclusion of the song was greeted wilh
cheers, “Coffin-mills,” repeated the President
with a smack of serious satisfaction in his voice—
“Coffin-Face, you have the glorious call !
Coffin-Face thereupon proposed that Vampire Joe
should sing his usual song. It appears this plea-
santly-named individual knew only one sorg (and
only oae verse of it at that) which he sang, by
established custom, at every meeting of the Club.
The verse ran as follows :
THE COFFIN-MAKER’S CAROL.
It was a coffin maker,
And gaily carolled he :
“ Like that of undertaker
Can any trade there be I
Of butcher, or of baker,
Or grocer, do you see ?
For they must wait for custom —
And custom comes to me."
Chorus,— When I hear the people’s clamour,
I laugh low as they go past
(While I hammer, hammer, hammer)
“ You must come to me at last !”
The whole strength of the club swelled the chorus,
and I regret to say that (as I was subsequently
informed) my voice was among the loudest. The
mugs were again charged, and Quirby rose up to
speak. He was evidently much respected in the
club, as nobody threw anything at him whilst he
was speaking. He suggested that the club should
engage a germ-specialists to go to China, collect a
quantity of cholera, typhus, yellow Jack, and
other germs friendly to the trade, pack them in
cases and send them to Sydney consigned to the
President of the Board of Health. On the cases
being opened business would, of course, begin to
boom. A subdued murmur of admiring applause
greeted this proposition. Encouraged by this,
Quirby proceeded to enlarge upon his pet idea of
grave-pipes. He suggested that pipes should be
inserted in every grave dug after a certain
date, and that these pipes should be con-
nected by telephone-wires with a Central
Corpse Exchange, where a clerk and a re-
lieving-clerk shouid sit night and day listening.
Each grave should have its number registered, and
arrangements should be made so that every corpse
buried, after the date pre-arranged, should be
enabled—in case he was a revived catalept—to
communicate with the clerk and duly disin-
terred. Quirby pointed out that this would be
a gain to the trade, inasmuch as a man rescued
from the grave meant ultimately a man to be
buried again, and, therefore, a double profit to the
undertaker. There was a stir among the two
rows of tombstones at this. Quirby merely smiled*
and remarked that his young friend, Dismal Dick,
would “ favour the company with a rendering of
his popular song, “ The Merry Mute. Dismal
Dick rose up readily, and I was not surprised,
after what I had already seen of the Tapleyan in-
congruity of the faces of the persons I had already
noticed, and their anomalous titles, to find that he
was a young gentleman having all the appearand
of a born lo w comedian. He began his song in an
aggressively hilarious baritone. I got a copy of
it afterwards, and give it in full below :
THE MERRY MUTE.
Oh, the life of a Mute is a life of cheer —
' He lives where another man dies!
And two bright pennies he spends in beer—
Two he takes from a dead man’s eyes.
Chorus.— O drink !
And wink
At all the maids 1
Where’er you go
Ours is, you know,
The merriest of trades.
They may talk as they like of their coaching joys,
But they’re not worth a tinker’s curse,
Like jogging along to the graveyard, boys,
On the top of a first-class hearse.
Then sing!
And swing
Your g.ass on high !
For we shall thrive,
And keep alive,
While there are men to die.
And as soon as we’ve dropped our fare, then that’s
The time when a mute’s a Bing ;
For we light our pipes, and we cock our hats,
And this is the song we sing.
Then drink!
And sink
Your cares in rum !
Your weepers wave !
Here’s to the grave !
Hurrah for Kingdom Come!
The cheers that greeted this gruesome melody
were suddenly interrupted by Quirby, who rose to
recite “ a little thing he had written himself. I
don’t remember much of it—nor, 1 suppose, does
Ouirbv for his speech was of a gurgling order by
this time-but, as far as I can remember, it went
in some way like this :
QUIRBY’S ADDRESS,
what (hie) what is that I see before me !
k gathering of gentlemen in black,
A » o rack small jokes, drink toasts,
and pass the bottle,
And bandy compliments like shuttle
cocks
Across the table at each other 2 No
Not much. I see with vision
I see —well yes, I se3 but never
mind 1
Men have their Alpha in the bassinette
tty
And their Omega in the wooden shell—
Finer, or rosewood, satin-lined, or plain,
According to the taste of customers
(An irresolute pause.)
But what's this talk about Cremation 2 Trash !
For who would give up the consoling pomp
Of the slow-moving hearse, with nodding plumes,
The waving weepers, and the mournful mutes,
And all the solemn circumstance of woe
(A line that I have heard somewhere before),
Telling the world another voter dead.
To be cremated, as they call it ? Pooh!
And who, in thunder, I would like to know,
Would leave his trade to follow—mark you now !
A little heap of ashes in a crock 2
The person who would do so, I should think,
Would be an all-fired effervescent a-s.
I remember little more about the proceedings. I
only know that I woke up in one of Quirby’s
coffins in the gray dawn of the following morning.
He was a wag, was Quirby.
THE SNOB BALLADS.
No. II.
WHAT’S IN A NAME!
What's in a name ? Not much, we’re told,
And yet we’ve sung a baron bold,
Who did net think a name a myth,
But Carington preferred to Smith.
What’s in a name ? Yet sundry wigh* s
Among us live, who to be knights
(Not such as clad in armour bright, "
In days of yore rushed to the fight;
Whom poet loves and minstrel sings—
Our knights are most inferior things),
Who “Mister” just to charge to “Sir,”
Would cringe and whine like mongrel cur
To those who in their inmost hearts
Despise them for their paltry arts.
And others, who, though arrant screws,
To give the devil all his dues,
Right gladly would their purse strings free
To buy three letters—C.M.G.
But he was still more plucky who
I Gave gold and lives for letters two
Seay 1 luck, not pluck, I should write down ;
I Both were his country's—not his own.
What's in a name ? Yet some there are,
J Who live beneath the Southern Star,
I Do look askance if “ men ” you say,
J For gentle men goodsooth are they ;
I To such a one I, joking, said ;
“ Pray, Mister, have you .ever read
I Two clever lines of ancient verse,
I In which is asked, in language terse
‘ When Adam delved and Eve span,
Say, who was thzn the gentleman 2 ’ ”
Not seeing that I meant to quiz,
He answered thus, with stolid phiz :
“ But surely, sir, you know that then
There never was no gentlemen.
For in those vulgar days of yore
The people all were shocking * pore,’
And Heving knows there’s nothing can
But money, make a gentleman.”
What’s is a name 2 Why there prevails
A madness, in fair New South Wales,
For picking out the biggest word
To give to something quite absurd,
And making out of nothing much—
I’ll mention one or two of such.
A housemaid is a “ lady-help,
A “ butler” some poor nigger whelp,
A public- house is an “hotel,”
A bank-clerk is a “ howling swell,”
“ Emporium ” we say for shop.
And “ constable ” for common slop,
A “barman” is the boy called pot.
Ten feet of land is quite a “lot” ;
In such, and many ways beside,
Through ignorance or foolish pride,
We mostly prove ourselves afraid
To plainly call a spade a spade—
In short, with sycophantic grovel,
We love to call the spade a shovel.
What’s in a name ? Well, goodness knows,
Bub yet it seems the question throws
A spell on all the fools in town,
Who, seemingly, are sitting down
And writing most prepost’rous rot,
To show that we shall go to pot
Unless we change our dear old name
For one invented by these same :
What reasons have they? —if such louts
Can reason, for I have my doubts—
I Not euphony, for each one fails,
j I’ll swear, to better New South Wales ;
And, just to prove that this is true,
Pray listen while I quote a few :
Here’s an address, one thinks quite grand,
“ A. Donki,
“ Sydney,
“ Sydney Land," !I!
Too lovely, this, without a flaw,
/laugh, he ! he ! he laughs, he 1 haw I
“ Neucambria ” from a Judge we get—
He meant, You’llhangria, I’ll bet;
Then comes a lady (111 be bound)
Who thinks that “ Cooksland ” well would sound ;
But think, dear dime, if people came,
Induced by this seductive name,
And found- oh I my, how they would swear—
A land of cooks with no cooks there I
Another, who from Sala cribs,
Would give us Colchis—don’t like “ prigs.”
And so full many witless wights
Are slinging ink, morn, noon, and nights—
The reason why, you clever “ nobs,”
Is plain, that all these folks are snobs
Who wish to see their stuff in pi int,
Or - but at this we’ll only hint —
Perhaps the name recalls the days
Their ancestors had different ways
From that ‘ high-tone ” which now prevails
In the beau monde of New South Wales ;
Or think, as snobs so often do,
That nothing’s good which is not new;
Perhaps for fun their hands they try,
Or any other reason why.
But now I think ’tia really right
That I, in turn, should be polite.
And try upon a name to hit,
Which may with all ideas fit:
I think that you will all confess
It should both sense and sound possess ;
Well, here it is no, I m too shy
To write it clear for every eye —
What shall I do I hie ! Hopkins, here I
Draw me a brimming glass of beer —
That’s right; now, snobs, just come and read,
The name. I think, will suit your breed,
It rhymeth with Australia,

The
FAIRY FLANNIGAN OR THE PANTOMIME PERI
AND THE POET
(WRITTEN FOR THE BULLETIN)
BY PHIL FLYNN
It was the merry Christmas time
When, with an elf and gnome
A Peri of the Pantomime
Was slowly plodding home.
Could this, indeed, be that bright fay
Who, twenty minutes since,
Was gliding down a long moon-ray
To charm the Fairy Prinee ?
Could this be that svelte fairy, who
(go lovely, yet so wise)
Unveiled those liquid lakes of blue,
The Sleeping Beauty’s eyes ?
Alas, it was ! The gods may grin,
Who made this maze of strife,
To see such transformations in
The Pantomime of Life.
But where are all the gauds she wore —
. Those scintillating things !
Some half an hour or so before ?
Where are her wand and wings ?
Where are her shoes—that pretty pair
That danced on lily-rims ?
The star that burned amid her hair ?
The gauze that wreathed her limbs ?
And that pink couple, full of charms,
Which made grave elders thralls,
And brought, in dissipated’swarms,
The baldheads to the stalls ?
“And brought in dissipated swarms the baldheads to the stalls.”
Some left behind; some—to make end—
Bfohght home by favour great
(They let her take them home to mend !)
Of the Triumvirate.
The scene must now be shifted to
A pleasant place and sweet;
In fact—to be quite plain with you—
A house in Sussex-street.
There lives, in unassuming way
(By mangling—when she can !)
The mother of our lovely fay,
The Fairy Flannigan.
And there within the top-back room,
Where noises seldom come,
Th re lies a Being steeped in gloom,
And—if you must know—rum.
His brows are knit, and dark despair
Looks from his eyes beneath ;
His locks of Apollonian hair
Are twisted in his teeth.
He has the most terrific drouth
’Twixt North and Southern Pole;
His tongue hangs in his blazing mouth,
And burns like a damned soul.
■Jet—think of it, ye Christian men,
While ye in revels join I
Ee has—O dismal fact to pen I
No credit, and no coin.
And there he lies from chime to chime
And watches, that poor elf,
A cheap, yet fearful, Pantomime.
Run solely by himself.
“ Who is he ?” you interrogate,
He’s —not to be too hard,
And still to put the matter straight—
A Disappointed Bard.
flui fiV Afi
w
“The mother of our lovely fay.”
He came from where the wombat roams,
And dingoes rend the air,
With a portmanteau full of “ pomes,”
And hayseed in his hair.
He took those “ pomes ” round with a smile,
And easy air and free ;
With easier and freer style
The W. P. B.
Received them. Editors would scoff—
Those literary sharks —
Though he essayed the manner of
The famous poet, Parkes,
We left him (last verse doesn’t scan!)
In trouble to the chin —
’Tis here the Fairy Flannigan
Into the tale comes in.
He with her mother lodged, this meek
But brilliant child of fame—
And regularly every week
He owed her for the same.
And to the Fairy oft he sent
Full many a loving lay,
And paid full many a compliment —
’Twas all he had to pay 1
And so it came to pass—ahem !
Now for an insult grim !
That though he did not “ part ” to them
They would not part with him.
The Peri of the Pantomime
This night, as oft before,
Came home and found him weaving rhyme—
And fighting with the floor.
She dressed her in her Peri dress,
Took up her starry wand,
And, like a dream of loveliness,
She did before him stand.
She charmed the snakes from off the wall,
The gorgons chased from sight,
And changed that small room to a hall —
A hall of dazzling light.
This was the Peri's usual task
In his delirium;
Then slily she drew out a flask—
It was a flask of rum.
Another act; The same old place,
And Mrs. Flannigan
Receiving, with a smiling face,
The bridesmaids and best-man.
Poor soul! she set up this joy—they
On her old shoulders leaned—
By sitting up both night and day,
And mangling like a fiend.
The Fairy ? Well, she bought the ring.
The flow’rs, and all to boot;
Paid parson, cab-fare, everything—
And bought the bridegroom’s suit.
The Bridegroom loaded up with—Dam !
This same old rhyme of Rum !
Contributed a cryptogram
Epithalamium.
The Fairy, who could wishes grant
As quickly as made known,
(When on the stage she did enchant)
Now had at last her own.
For she had longed—poor thing ! for years
To wed a Bard intense,
Whose songs should be too deep for tears,
And, probably, for sense ;
So that her neighbours in the row
She might with envy note,
S< y—“ There goes Missus So-and-So,
The wife of the Great Pote.”
This in her little mind she’d planned
(As shallow as a dish
It was, but true and honest), and
Fom bet she got her wish I
It came at last that this poor lad—
Though he made many a wry
Mouth at the mess—by thunder, had
To eat his works, or die I
Last scene : the Royal: Treasury Day.
With faces glum as psalms
The “ pros.” (you bet, sirs !) for their pay
Put out their little palms.
But look! What figure have we here ?
First Murderer ? Not so hard 1
Brigand ? No, neither. Lend your ear
That is the Fairy’s Bard I
t»e j3p
s
And ever since their fates did join,..
Thus, at this time, he’d come
To gather up her little coin—
And slosh it round in Rum.
How do they live ? We can’t quite say.
But this much we have gleamed—
The Old Girl still works night and day,
And mangles like a fiend.
Moral ;
To girls. A moral you may vamp
From this —it isn’t hard! —
Wed Burglar, Local Preacher, Tramp—
But never wed a Bard.
But if you will, for best or worst,
Take a Poetic Sphinx—
Pray call upon the Fairy first,
And ask her what she thinks I

SUPPLEMENT TO THE “BULLETIN” (SYDNEY, N.S.W.), CHRISTMAS, 1887.
THINGS WE SEE WHEN WE COME OUT WITHOUT OUR GUN.




IMPERIAL!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here, after all the greasy professions
about Her Majesty being the devoted servant o f
the people, we learn that the British Government
declines to officially recognise the French Exhibi-
tion —because it is contrary to monarchic dig-
nity (!) to assist at a ceremony which recalls the
dismissal of an Emperor and the founding of
Constitutional Government in the shape of a Re-
public.
THE SIGNAL.
A nation meets to celebrate,
By rich display of art and skill,
The dawn of Freedom o’er her State—
The birth of that majestic thrill
Which beckoned, at the people’s will,
U The tried and trusted, wise and great,
Her palaces of power to fill,
And drove the despot from her gate.
The pride of that immortal hour
That ushered in her liberty,
Hurled shattering down Imperial power
And rendered France the fair and free,
From Jura to the eddying sea,
In cottage as in glittering bower ;
Preached to the world the People’s plea,
And made a hundred tyrants cower I
What wonder, then, if courtly hand
Should shrink in rage from touch of hers,
And angry monarchs frowning stand
And greet her glory with a curse 2
Their jewelled crowns and costly furs,
Her deeper pageant, nobly grand,
Can amply spare, and still rehearse
A purer scene, in happier land.
But Britain—she whose echoing boast
Has been the freedom of her race—
Goes proudly past the muttering host,
And ’mid the gladness takes her place,
With blithesome step and radiant face,
At welfare of the sister coast 1
Ah, no! Lament your sore disgrace
Who loVe your nation’s heart the most!
ihame ! bitter shame! that men should speak
The wrongs that have too surely been !
Well may the mad blush scorch your cheek
Por England’s Court and England’s Queen I
Whom ye with simple smile serene
Have fondly dreamed alone to seek
Your bidding, and, contented, lean
On you, a loving servant meek 1
Ye were deceived—the people’s reign
That from his throne a despot shook,
Rankles within her as a pain
Beyond the power of mind to brook ;
What! marked ye not the hostile look,
The orders to her courtier train,
Nor yet that Gallia’s envoys took
Their kindly guest-word all in vain ?
Ye marvel yet—but glance around !
Imperial glitter nears the throne,
And daily sparkling toys abound,
To bribe their interests to her own,
Whose sycophantic hopes have flown
Where’er the badge of * rank ’ is found ;
While widows all unheeded groan
And with their tear-drops soak the ground.
Yet list! The last Napoleon’s doom,
The great Republic’s life began,
Her regal state surveys with gloom ;
Their memory’s feast she bids us shun.
Nor aught alleged of evil done,
Or that ’gainst British race may loom ;
But this: Restrainless reign o'errun,
Borne down, and sealed in History’s tomb.
Nation, or Queen ! The hour is here !
No time to trifle or delay !
Will ye iu meek, mute, craven fear
Sign all of freedom left, away 2
And own a monarch’s right to sway,
Though all the Nation’s voice shall rear
In anguish, an unwilling prey,
Yet bound its murderers to revere I
No ! here at least on Austral shore
Let every voice spring keen and clear,
And sternly shout the message o’er
Of Freedom’s choice, with Freedom’s cheer!
By all that to your hearts is dear
Stand ready, like your sires of yore,
To struggle for a true career
TUI wrong takes flight-for evermore !
WHERE AND OH WHERE ARE THEY?
Where are now the merry party,
Where is now the jolly show,
All so sprightly, bright, and hearty,
Not so very long ago 2
Long ago 2 No. Ten years 2 Five years 2 Well,
not much more than five. Weave just past the
middle of the eighties now, and it was the very
tail of the seventies then. Ah, how warm it was
in that December I Earth and heaven seemed all
aflame, and rays from a thousand sources focussed
about the footlights of Sydney Royal. From j ust be ■
yond the footlights, radiation began again. But
rays snot forth and impinged, and burned, and
enkindled. Alas, what heats I And are they
burning still 2 God save us, no! They are colder
than clay. There is but one thing in this world
df
Hm.
POLICEMAN: “'ERE’S A HINFRINGEMENT O THE HACT.”
that is really cold—that
chills and thrills and
shocks you, and breeds
cold again, and horror t
You know what that is.
But it isn’t come to
that? Not all, not all,
but yet too much. Can
you remember it now
—the frolic and aban-
don, the taran-tara, the
tira-lira, the torpedo,
and the whale 2 Weren’t
we all whales then,
and blown kite-high out
of the region of common-
sense and all earthly
considerations ? Then
that dear Drummer
Boy, so svelte, so light-
some, so—let it pass,
let it pass! Wasn’t
there Elsie, and Maud,
and Dot, too, and dear
old Hallewell who, in
quaint disguise, used to
pour from his great
throat the roaring bars,
and who weathers it as
well as the best of them
and Bambini, and the
Duke 2
All are scattered now and fled,
Some are married, some are dead ;
Golden boys and girls all must
Like chimney sweepers, come t dust.
It is natural to mix the poets when we do but re-
member what mixing and mixing and mingling
there has been amongst that merry crew. Elise,
now, where did we see her last 2 Was that Elise
whose rags fluttered in the July gale, who had
changed from the fay of the footlights to the
ghoul of the darkness beside the Refuge wall 2
And that merry wonder who would rattle her
laughter against the ribs of a consumptive patient
till his shrunk gums parted wider, and his rattling
teeth closed in a ghastly grin—
Is it real or is it vision,
That imquarters not Elysian—
(Radiant memory ! shall we mar it
By that picture in a garret?)
Slippered but suggesting bunion,
Odour very much like onion,
Hair bedraggled, figure spread,
Beauty like a snakeskin shed—
Supper ready, dirty delf,
Brandy-bottle on the shelf.
Was that what Killed the whale, and cooked the
goose, and sent many and many a poor gander
home without a feather to fly with 2 Don’t know.
We think of the Drummer Boy again, and see the
radiant creature rising like Mahomet in his earlier
journeys from heaven to heaven. Dear Drummer
Boy, we are not going to hurt you, or vex you, or
perplex you in any way whatever, we like to
think about you because so much of the rest is so
sad, so very sad. We like to think of you as the
fair princess in the marvellous robe—
“ Whose skirts were broidered with bright sunny
beams,
Glist’ring like gold among the plights enrolled,
And here and there shooting forth silver
streams
’Mongst which crept little angels through the
glittering gleams.”
“ Seemed like these little angels did uphold”
Pah, we shall get too far directly, too deep in
ecstasy, and then—turn, turn, mad world ! Do
you remember the row of shining pates that
seemed lit as with inward rapture whenever the
Drummer Boy approached the footlights? Can
you recall the exquisites who used to sit in the
circle aloft, creaseless and spotless behind and
before, eyes all front, and hearts also? They
weren’t bad hearts, either, though they did run
away with by no means foolish heads. Do you
want to know what became of them, at least of
one of them 2 Ring the bell softly, if you do, put
crape on the door, don’t mock or gloat about it
because it was good man's work! Ah, if he had
only taken himself by the throat somewhat less
violently 12 months earlier ! Down by the Albert

Park Lagoon in Melbourne, on a chilly winter’s
night when the wind came whispering up from
the broad salt waters of the Bay, sighing through
the pines in the hissing oaks. Far away he could
see the lights of Melbourne. Just beyond the
trees the ghostly line of the beach and then the
black pall of the broad water. He had not grown
shabby—coat creaseless, hat nicely polished still,
boots glossy, and cane in hand. He sat upon
one of the unpainted benches and lit a cigar and
smoked, rattled a few shillings in his pocket—h
had changed the last pound—heard the final
stroke of 11, waited till the chimes rang the next
quarter, then took off his hat, laid aside his stick
and cigar, walked into the water, and lay down—
pressed his face on to the muddy bottom where
the tide just barely rippled over his back, lay
there while the bubbles rose and broke on the
surface —lay there till the bubbles ceased to rise,
was found there in ihe morning—did I not say
ring the bell softly, tell his blame gently, let him
rest, rest; he paid all, did he not 2
* * *
And, how half-a-dozen men of Sydney laughed
the other day when the terrier of the New South
Wales Parliamentary kennel wanted to know if
something wasn’t wrong about a certain institu-
tion, if somebody hadn’t gone away I What
noses they have, these fellows ; how they can
sniff and snuff and discover any congenial taint—
even beyond centuries I He was only four year
behind. Five years ago, don’t you remembers
how he was not attracted as an ordinary particle
and released in due course, but sucked right into
the roaring vortex, down, down, down to bottom-
less perdition, so it seemed. Heigho ! a butterfly
in January—and in June 2 Where were all the
terriers in June when we found the poor moth
with wings so sadly sorched, out of sight in a
dusty corner, only too eager to be wrapt up and
bundled off to some out-of-the-way nook of the
world, out of the reach of the terriers, out of the
sight of the candles and the stars 2
* * *
And still you are tripping across the stage,
Nyum Nyum 2 And laughing gaily as of old; still
the song and the dance go on, and why not 2
Shall wise men lack warmth because some fools
burn 2 Shall we extinguish the candles ou lof
pity for the moths 2 Keep your distance, keep
your distance ! That is the philosophy of the
matter, or wait till, like the old shiny pates in the
front row, all the flux of your nature is changed
to asbestos that may kindle to a fair red heat, but
will never burst into flame. Think of Albert
Park, young man ; think of the dusty garret and
the terriers outside! You will cock up your
beaver, and who but you, eh 2
“ Aye, aye, the white swan,
By God I’m the man.”
You think so, yes ; but how strangely will your
opinion be modified when you look back over only
five years, when you look up yourself, and try to
look up them —
The days of your earliest years,
The days when you first were a man,
When you’d laughter that ended in tears,
And joy like a flash in the pan ;
Pleasure with pain for leaven,
Summer with flowers that fell—
Brief bliss like a vision of Heaven,
And long pain like endurance of hell.
But somehow you survived it. You were skinned
and went back. All that year’s screw gone, and
all next year's mortgaged to the Jews. Life
didn’t seem worth much, eh 2 Then you took a
pull at the billy and stretched down beside the
Are, and having heard one or two sheep
cough, contentedly shut your eyes and thought
a bit. And the fragrance come out of
the old coolabah log and took your thoughts
back as incense in the church bears up a priest’s
prayers. But the year parsed and the Jew was
paid, and another and another, and your beard
grew and your knowledge broadened, and you got
a station, and came down with the last of the
wool, and, just to humour a passing fancy, took
the old familiar seat, and looked and—thought.
How the faces were changed all round the ring 1
It seemed to you that the whole theatre, like the
human body, is built up anew once in every seven
years. You were an old atom, an unfamiliar par-
ticle in an absolutely new mass. All you knew
seemed
Scattered, lost, and fled,
Some were married, some were dead.
If you shut your eyes you saw Bambini prance
across the stage, and the dear Duke come solemnly
down the palace steps. You saw the old and
merry party troop in, the stage was crowded.
You opened your eyes, yes, the stage was
crowded again, but where and oh where were
they you had known 2 You went home and to the
whisky-bar and to bed deeply pondering that
thought. You couldn’t understand how many of
them had been used up. You had never realized
how fierce is that from whose extreme flame
tongues had scorched you. But how will it bo

SONGS Of SYDNEY SUBURBS.
(AFTER LEWIS MORRIS, AUTHOR OF “SONGS
OF BRITAIN.")
THE LAND BOARD OF THREE.
Parallel with the tramline in Paddington a street
upward and downward ;
The centre is paven with stones and the sidewalks
are neatly kerbed;
A cleanly street in the summer, when all things
bathe in the sunshine ;
Cleanly and bright in the winter, and cleanly and
who’esome always.
The taxpayers’ money is speedily, handsomely,
lavishly spent there,
For in three of the houses live aldermen and
aldermen own five more.
The name of the street is Luscombe and at number
19 lives a maiden ;
Wan is her face and knotted her hair and slow is
her gait.
Once she arose with the daylight and sang till the
birds in amazement
Flocked to the window-panes and applauded with
beaks to the glass :
“ Riae, happy day, arise 5 rise, happy day, I em-
brace you;
For lam the maiden, I of all others, blessed on
the earth! ”
A sweet, sweet singer she was, for the song welled
up from her bosom.
Up from the founts of her life, as the song of the
songbird does;
For her heart was caught and was held in the hand
of the Infinite Passion,
Caught and held by Love, the greatest of all
Earth’s kings 1
Sweetly she therefore sang, and the morning
breaking around her
Revealed the picture of beauty, blue-eyed, arch-
nosed, red-lipped;
While the white garment that clothed her, like
the peplus of ancient sea-queens,
Was covered on shoulders and waist with a mist
of auburn hair.
Annetta the first of her names was, but Venus of
Paddington truly
Would come much nearer the mark. Annetta,
however, grieved not.
Out from the dusk of the morning, revealed to
the birds that applauded,
In the midst of the glory of girlhood she walked
to the duties of day.
She stood at the counter in Pitt-street, disposing
of gloves and collars,
And her wage of seven-and-sixpence was shared
with her mother old.
These were the brightest of days, for a part of
each day then was Andrew —
Andrew in lavender kids, the adorable clerk of
the Lands.
Apollo was nobly-featured, but he hadn’t the pro-
file of Andrew;
Adonis was gentle-eyed, but his eyes had not
Andrew’s gaze;
An ethereal something thrilled as his movements
struck the beholder;
And women fell down when he passed and weep-
ingly called his name.
And Andrew would lean on the counter, and two
ethereal somethings,
The something in him and in her, would commune
in mute discourse ;
Another month and a dawn would break and the
steps of an altar
Would risa to her timorous eyes, and a white-
surpliced parson say,
“ Until death parts, no parting.” Annetta would
look up at Andrew ;
And Andrew would look at Annetta, and the
mute discourse proceed.
But a Minister wanted to save, and set np a
Board to help him
To cut the expenses down, and this Board of
Three wrote out
A list of the handsomest clerks, to be thrown
headlong from the window,
The Minister laughed, and threw them. Forth-
with a shower of kids,
The prettiest gloves and boots, the narrowest
hair-striped trousers,
The daintiest scarves and ties, and what they
were tied about,
All came down like rain, and last of the shower
eame Andrew.
He fell at the feet of Annetta, and both ethereals
swooned.
Ah, welladay, where’s the wedding ? Poor Andrew
declined to low courses :
He fondled the pewter and drank ; he sat on the
beer-cask and dozed—
Ah, welladay, he lost courage, lost spirit, lost
manhood, and ended
By dying just three days ago, with his head on
Annetta’s knee J
Ab, welladay—and Annetta? Behold her again
in the morning :
The glory of girlhood is gone, and the face is
withered and bleached ;
The light, lissome figure is stooped, and her mist
of rich auburn tresses
Is visible only in shaggy, rough knots and tangles,
like burrs.
Ah, welladay, never bird now comes up to ap-
plaud at her window;
Ah, welladay, never sings she the song of the old
glad time;
Only she moans, looking outward, “Let me be,
let me be in my sorrow ;
By the Land Board of Three I am slain; I am
ftin-in by the Land Board of Three I ”
THE BANK-CLERK OF GOHANNA FLAT.
The fashionable society of the township of
Gohanna Flat (that isn’t its name, but it will do
just as well) in the southern part of Victoria was
lately put into a pleasant flutter by the arrival in
its midst of a new bank-clerk. He was a nice-
spoken, gentlemanly young man, dressed in irre-
proachable bank-clerk costume, and wearing a
pensive smile. He could play the piano, dance
like a faun, and sing like a m justaohloed seraph.
He soon became an immense favourite with both
sexes. Yet he had one little but fatal weakness
which would have made him a brilliant ornament
of the Press if—if —well, if he hadn’t been born to
be a bank-clerk. He looked
too fixedly on the rum
when it was red. One
night he was at a liquor-
party—a popular way of
passing time in Gohanna
Flat—and led the laughter
for a few hours, when he suddenly
disappeared. Theylooked for him
under the table, in the beer-cellar,
and every other probable place, but
he was not to be found. Surmising
that he had merely gone home to bed,
they settled themselves down to busi-
ness, which this interruption had seri-
ously hindered. Business in Gohanna
Flat, at nighjb anyhow, meant get-
ting drunk. Next morning, at the
hour when the bank should have been
opened, the manager made his ap-
pearance, but there was no sign of
his elegant subordinate. The gay
feature of the affair was that he had
the keys of the bank with him. Search
was made for him all over the town-
ship, but in vain. To make matters
more beautifully complicated, the
Bank Inspector arrived in Gohanna
Flat that morning and found the
bank closed. Or course he had to be
told the reason, and he cursed till he
was blue. Then he had the
doors forced open and discovered
that the cash was all right. The only
theory that remained to account for the disappear-
ance of the young man that then remained was
that he had staggered down to the bank of the
river and got drowned. The village wag said
that as he passed along the bank early
in the morning he heard hiccups coming
up from the bottom of the river. Anyhow
the whole township turned out with drags, meat-
hooks on lines, forked clothes-props, and every-
I thing they could lay their hands on that would be
1 remotely likely to dislodge his body from the mud.
The wag previously referred to calmly sat down
on the stump of a tree to fish for him with a bottle
of rum at the end of a rope. “If he don’t rise to
that," said the baleful humourist, “ he’ll rise to
nothing." While they angled for him in the
depths of the cold river many a fair cheek was wet
I with tears. But the Beauty of Gohanna Flat (who
was not only fair of face but the heiress to a row
I of houses and a tannery), to whom the missing
| Lothario was secretly engaged, lost no time ir
weeping. She had her horse saddled, and, withou
saying a word to anyone, rode out into the bush
to search for him. She didn’t believe he was
drowned. Three days passed, and yet no sign of
the lost one in wood or river. At last, on
the evening of the third day, as the
Beauty was returning sorrowfully home,
she became aware of a tattered figure sitting in
the fork of a gum-tree and howling like a dingo.
It was the object of her affections—the being on
whom she had lavished her pure young love. But,
oh, how changed ! He was without a hat or coat,
and his pants were borne up by one frail suspender.
He had only one boot on, and his shirt hung round
him in festoons. She said never a word, but rode
into town in a fury of disgust, and told some men
where to find him. That ended her young dream.
He had to be kept chained up in the
hotel for a week. Now those of you
who have read this journal diligently,
and profited by its religious instruc-
tion, will guffaw gloomily at what
follows. One night he broke loose and
rushed into a room occupied by a
Presbyterian clergyman, and falling
down on his knees (in his singlet)
began to confess his sins to him ! We
can, when we girl our teeth and lay
ourselves out ftr it, write an oc-
casional lurid line or two, but no pen
that ever ploughed paper since the
days of Dante could describe the
horror of that follower of John Knox,
when his benumbed senses grasped the
full shockingness of the situation.
At the end of the week the Bank
Inspeccor returned to the township
and called this merry young gentle-
man into the manager’s room. “You
are in the habit of drinking, Mr. ,
I believe ?” said the Bank Inspector.
Interrogatively. “ A little,” replied
the clerk, modestly. ‘‘How
much a day on an average?—
A bottle of whisky ?” continued the
» I
Inspector in a dry,
statistical tone.
“Yes,” replied
the clerk with
confidence, as
though it were
rather a credit
to him than other-
wise. “More
than that ?—two
bottles?” said the
Inspector.
“ No-o,” answered the clerk, musingly, “ not that
much.” “How much, then?” “Say a bottle and
a half,” answered the clerk, with a pleasant smile
“Say a bottle and a half! Well I’m d d!”
murmured the paralysed Inspector, collapsing
into his chair. That evening a muffled form
might have been seen diving into the Melbourne
train. It was the dashing bank-clerk who had
played havoc with all the female hearts in
Gohanna Flat. He has not once been seen there
since, but he has left behind him a memory that
will never die.
“ Mosquitoes ! What do ye know about mosqui-
toes?'’ said Big Sam. “If ye had been with me
and Jimmie Junkaway on the Belyando, about
twelve year ago, ye might speak about mosqui-
toes. We was camped near the big waterholea
btlow St. Anne’s, and Jim went in ‘ bogieing,
and got took with a cramp in the stommick, or
something, and went under. Well, he had touched
mud twice, and come up for the third time of ask-
ing. to let a yell out of him, or take a
look at the scenery, when a buck mosquity
(reg’lar old warrior), that was roosting on
a branch just over him dug his per-
boseis into his arm, and held on, too, till
I come up and rescooedhim. Jim was pretty well
played out by that time, though. The mosquity
must have kept his spear-pump going pretty ac-
tive and Jim was sucked as diy as the dottle of a
clay pipe, and didn't weigh more nor two dry
lamb-skins. As soon as the mosquity seen that I
had a good hold of Jim by the wool he pulled his
nose out on his arm, and set sail down the lagoon.
He must have passed somewhere in the neigh-
bourhood of our camp, for when we got back
to the waggons young Tommy Offside told us
that a big fat native companion had flew oyer just
afore, a-singing a new song like a hallelujah army.
Now I calls the doin’s of that critter the act of a
real Christian, though he was a bit of a bloed-
sucker..” And Big Sam again wrapped him-
self in the stately folds of his Condammer, and
soon started a rich baritone snore, strong enough
to shake a flying squirrel off a gum-tree.
DRIVEN HOME.
A JUBILEE POEM.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
(“ In London the other day there was an inquest held
upon the body of John Baker, a boiler-plater, aged 47, who
had committed suicide by hanging himself from a chisel
‘driven home’ into the wall of the house in which be lived—
or rather despaired of living. The evidence showed that
for two and a half years Baker, a sober industrious man,
with a wife and three children, had been utterly uuable to
obtain any work. In th» earlier part of their awful struggle
his wife had earned from 10s. to lls per week, but for the
last 18 months only from 7s. to 8 c A fortnight before
Baker committed what the papers call the ‘ rash act ’ he had
walked to Sheffield—starting wi h threepence in his pocket—
in order to make a last supreme effort to find
work, tailing his wife that he would ‘ beg or starve
on the road." He was unable to obtain employment there,
and having no money, he walked the streets cf Sheffield for
two nights. On Wednesday he started to walk back to
London, which he reached at 5 o’clock on Sunday morning,
having never broken his fast from the previous Tuesday, save
with a crust given him by a bootmak-r. During the week he
was away Mrs. Baker had earned 2s. 9d. On the Monday
morning she paid the landlord (to whom she owed £1 Bs. for
rent) 2s. 6d The next morning he called and told her the
house was on the list for the bailiffs. Her husband heard
him say this. On Wednesday morning she went to work,
leaving the door looked so that the bailiffs might not enter.
On her return she found her husband banging dead. A
neighbour attested to having heard hollow blows during the
evening—presumably the sound of the chisel being driven
home. The evidence proved that the Bakers had always
striven against, and endeavoured to conceal, their poverty.
The Cconer said there was nothing sensational about the
c»se; it was one of those terrible narratives of what was
going on in London which they heard often, but which
seemed to attract far lets attention than they ought to ’’)
la the Jubilee Year when t he rockets
Shot upward, and few were so mean
As to furnish no gold from their pockets
To honour Our Lady the Queen,
Tn the Jubilee Year when the nation
Was mad with applause and acclaim—
Mad with utter despair and starvation
Seared with sorrow that wrapt him as flaun -
Wearied out with the cross of a trial
That bowed his weak frame to the duet,
Worn with years of an iron Denial,
Done to death for the lack of a crust -
la the Jubilee Year, when the gladness
Of voices and fireworks was high,
Cooped alone with his passionate madness,
What was left for this man but to die ?
“ Driven home” while a kingdom elated
Shed gold at the foot of a Throne—
‘l Driven home ” while the Bailiffs awaited
Outside, and men’s hearts seemed of stone
With the tears of an infinite pity
For the ones that he loved in his eyes—
“ Driven home,” while the merciless city
Was ringing with jubilant cries I
Just one case of the many unwritten
Just a common occurrence, no more ;
In the bountiful realm of Great Britain
You can count deaths like this by the score ;
In the land where they pamper, and cherish.
And fatten, and bow before drones.
Men like this man have perished, and perish
While hypocrite cheers drown their groans
Men like this man have died and are dying
In the hells that no language can paint,
With the sound of starved little ones crying
In ears that Death’s mercy makes faint,
While lords of the lawn and the ermine
Speak words af assurance and praise—
Men whose hands weave the robes, pent like vermii
In dens live the death of their days !
Read the record again till you gather
Its meaning—again and again
Ask yourselves if Our Heavenly Father
But sleeps or has ended his reign—
Learn the story by heart, 0 my brothers,
In the name of the white Christ who died,
Throw it round you as seed—let the others
Hear of this through the earth far and wide!
Let them know that this dead boiler-maker,
This man craving leave but to toil,
This wan, woe-smitten, self-slain John Baker
Found no room on England’s free soil.
Let them know how through stresses inhuman.
Of misery that went past alljtears,
By the slavery of one stricken woman,
This man only lived, and for years !
Let them know while the nation applauded
Its great ones, and beat its big drums—
One whom Greatness of bread had defrauded—
Died this death in the horrible slums—
Tired of touching his brow to his betters,
Vainly seeking the lot of a slave,
Broke from England’s unbearable fetters,
And fled through the gates of the grave !
Driven home! When the myriads assemble
At last to the terrible call,
Lords and Bishops and Monarchs may tremble
At thought of those blows on the wall!
For the voice of the Mighty All-Maker
May thunder : “ Your deed was the worst—
By your hands, not the hand of John Baker,
It was driven I Depart ye Accurst! ”
Llthgow, November i.
When the workmen were overhauling the
ruins of the burnt Hxeter Theatre, the other day,
and bringing out the bodies, they were a good deal
worried by the conduct of a nigger-boy who stood
in the corner with a basket of girgerbeer and
gazed a 1! them. Ha wasn’t obtrusive in any way;
he did not come round and try to foroa the sale of
his flat and muddy liquor ; he merely gtocd and
glared. Ha was a very small nigger, too, and his
clothes were black, as if he had been rolling in
the dust and debris of the theatre. For a
solid honr he stood composedly in the
corner and didn't sell a single bottleful,
till at last the workmen grew tired of
the way he kept his eye on them, and one of them
yellad, “ Hi, boy I ” But the little nigger never
moved. Then they called to him to fetch some
ginger-beer, but he took no notice, and they con-
cluded that be didn’t understand English. Finally
cno of them said he would sta*t the little black
varmint, and he went over with two of his mates
and fetched the silent African youth a crack in
the waistcoat. And as he did so the ginger-beer-
seller collapsed and crumbled into a heap of dust
with a head lying on top of the pile. He was the
ordinary refreshment-boy of the theatre burnt to
a cinder.


John Visian's
CONFESSION.
WRITTEN FOR THE Bulletin
The Rev. Mr. Browne, most excellent of
gaol-chaplains, has urged me to make a full, true,
and particular confession of the offence against
the peace of her Majesty the Queen for which I
am confined in this exceedingly disagreeable place.
* * *
It is more than probable that if Mr.
Browne’s request were my only reason for doing
what he asks I should not do it. He has, no
doubt, performed his duty of lecturing me upon
.the error of my ways with conscientious zeal, and
I have no doubt that he will play his part in the
little function arranged for to-morrow with the
utmost propriety. Nevertheless, I do not care
twopence for the Rev. Mr. Browne. Shocking,
but true.
* * *
For my own amusement, however, and to
dissipate the tedium of this interminable evening,
I think I will attempt some sort of narrative of
the transaction which the daily newspapers saw
fit to characterise as the atrocious murder of
Henry Yissian by his brother. I may remark at
the outset that I have no sympathy with the sen-
timent generally expressed on the subject of
fratricide. Why is it any worse for me to kill my
brother than to kill some other man’s brother ?
We excuse the man who kills his faithless wife.
We may hang him, but still we recognise the
power of hatred based on former love as irre-
sistible. I had at the outset a very proper affection
for my brother. Circnmstances resulted in the
destruction of that affection —concurrent circum-
stances replaced it by a strong animosity. And,
in a moment of great exasperation, I terminated
the life of a man whose existence had become a
continual offence to me.
* * *
The immediate provocation was, as many
persons have since remarked, apparently very
trifling. I was in the gallery of a theatre, and he
was in a private box. I left my se it a moment
before the curtain fell, walked round to the front
of the house, and killed him as he was about to
enter his carriage. I admitted.at the time that I
killed him because he was in a box and I was in
the gallery. I don’t know that I could sum-
marize the grounds for my crime more con-
cisely. He was a successful man—and I was
a failure. The failure was distinct at
the time ; I was absolutely ragged. To be
ragged is, in this happy country, to be wretched.
A man may dress plainly, carelessly, even shab-
bily, from preference. I have not much sympathy
with such a predilection, but I know it is a not
uncommon form of eccentricity. To bs ragged is,
however, an altogether different matter. My
boots were quite unfit to wear. The left boot,
just above the heel, had split away from the
upper, and lagged upon the pavement as I walked.
The right boot had broken away from the sole on
the outside of the foot, so that my toes projected
over the edge of the sole. My clothes were
tattered and soiled. The rain, beating on my
thin coat, soaked through to my skin, and the
wind seemed to strike viciously at my cold breast.
My hat was cracked and limp ; the rain ran
through its broken brim and poured down the
back of my neck. I was hungry. For several
days I had lived on dry bread, and the stale
crumb lay like lead in my stomach. I had almost
forgotten the brightness of life, the voices of
women singing and laughing, the sound of mu°ic,
the scent of flowers and wine. My face was un-
shaven and haggard with night-walking and dirt,
my nails were rough and filthy.
# * *
That is why I killed my brother. I have
admitted very frankly whatever aggravation of
the crime there may have been in the lack of im-
mediate provocation. And I will be equally candid
on the subject of premeditation. I not only in-
tended to kill him, but I had cherished the inten-
tion for several weeks. I saw him enter the
theatre with a certain woman, a woman for whom
I had at one time entertained a great fondness. I
went into the gallery of the theatre to see them
together. The shilling which I expended in doing
so was a shilling that I had begged—that I had
kept in my pocket during hours of great suffering
which the use of that shilling would have re-
lieved. I could have bought hot, thick, strong
food with it—meat. I could have purchased a
night’s lodging with it. To a delicately nurtured
man, the want of a bed is almost as painful as the
want of food. I had spent the last six nights in
prowling. My bones and muscles called for a bed
as loudly as my stomach called for food. If you
think it out, a homeless man in London is not
very well off. In the country he can sneak into a
field, and perhaps crawl into a heap of straw.
But in town he has no real rest except in fair
weather. Then, of course, he can sleep on the
grass in one of the parks during the day, and walk
from dark until daylight. The evening passes
quickly enough. I used to watch men coming
down the steps of their clubs, and going to the
theatre. Later, it interested me to stand on the
sidewalk in Seamore Place, or some other nice
part of town, and see the sleek dandies and the
pretty girls slip from their carriages and dis-
appear under the awnings. And how I have
cursed them! I fancy that our amiable friends,
the Nihilists, work themselves up to the sticking-
point in the same way. Still later, Fleet-street
was always bright and busy ; and, after the news-
papers were out, I would go to Covent Garden and
hang about among the market-men till daylight.
* * *
And all the while my dear brother was
eating and sleeping his fill. "Wcat insatiable pigs
the men and women of society aie ! Every sort
of social allowance is made an excuse for stuffing. |
Races and weddings, dances and garden-parties —
nothing without a guzzling match. They can’t
go to a football-match without making a sty of
Lord’s. But about my brother. He was in even-
ing dress, of course, and had not buttoned his
overcoat—a great piece of carelessness, that,
when he had just left a heated theatre. Perhaps
I saved him from catching a terrible cold. I had
to be very careful about stabbing him, for if I had
failed the first time I should probably have been
interfered with. It seems a simple enough opera-
tion. ana yet it requires a certain precision. The
motion is quite unlike any movement one makes
in the ordinary way. In striking out at a man
with your fist you throw the elbow up, but in
stabbing him you bung the wrist sharply down to
the level of the elbow.
* * *
He saw me as I raised my hand with the
knife in it. I caught his eye and I winked at
him. That wink must have annoyed him. I
have since regarded it with much complacency,
as a detail illustration of thoroughness of pur-
pose. I wish I could have seen my face at the
moment, bat I know pretty well what sort of
wink it was. You know the look a man gives a
lot of others when he is going to crack a good
joke on some one—a malicious sort of wink 1
That was it p-ecisely. The woman saw it toe-
in fact, she mentioned it in describing the inci-
dent in court. I felt the knife catch on one of
his ribs, but it slipped to one side of it, and I got
it in nearly up to the handle. I tried to give it a
little twist when it would not go auy further, but
it was too tightly fixed. Fortunately there were
policemen at hand, so that I was not roughly
handled. I will say this for the police : they are
not rough with a man who does not resist arrest,
unless indeed he has been teasing them, and that
of course would irritate anyone. A crowd, on the
other hand, will hustle a man most wretchedly
under such circumstances, particularly if he has
used a knife,
* * *
I am constantly interrupted by the idiots
who imagine that I want to kill myself. Grea f er
nonsense I can’t imagine. To a man of my tem-
perament the prospect of being hanged has no
little fascination If I could lay my hands on a
pot of money of course I would not want to die.
Only a fool would. But in my present circum-
stances I quite fail to see anything to be coveted
in life. And if one is going to die he may as well
experience the carious sensations which hanging
is supposed to afford. I must say that I shall be
disgusted if the official entrusted with the per-
formance of the ceremony makes such a botch of
it as was made in the case of that fellow who
murdered the old woman at Babbicombe—l mean
Lee, hbout whose case we are still reading in the
papers. To be messed about in that fashion
would annoy a saint.
• * *
La-La. Of course this is all make-believe
and pappyoock, and I am really as wretched as a
man can be. I am going to be hanged —killed,
put an end to, destroyed. I choked once, diniog
at the Ship, over a bone. Will it be like that, I
wonder ? I felt red in the face then and my head
weighed so much I had to hold myself up against
the wall till the bone came out. Hanging can’t be
like that though, for it breaks one’s neck sud-
denly.
* * *
What an ass I have always been ! When
I was about three years old my nurse said to me,
“Master Jack, if you eat so much marmalade
you will be ill.” “ I know that,” said I, “ but I’m
going to eat the marmalade." That has been my
way ever since. The various forms of marmalade
have cost me some bad hours —and now I have
come to the end of it.
* * *
After all, why did I kill him ? Vanity—
that was it at bottom. To make that woman
recognise my existence. She had looked down on
me as dirt from the very first, even when I had
money and friends. I was talking to her one day
at Hurliogham, and I said, “Now, I’m not at all
the cut of man you could get fond of, am 17”
“ No," said she, “ you arc not a good man.” She
was naturally and inevitably a woman with a
weakness for propriety and straight-dealing. She
knew nothing against me, except that I lived
pretty freely, and was supposed to be a bit know-
ing about turf matters. On the other hand, she
knew that my brother was the most c immonplace
individual imaginable—and she chose him. Of
course, I should have gone to the deuce anyway
but not quite so fast. The hair at the back of her
neck used to work loose from the coil, and she
used to put her hand up to straighten it. How
pretty she was, to be sure! Just as the police
laid hold of me I looked at her. Her wrap
had dropped, and I saw the mark on her
arm where she had been vaccinated. I wonder
how she feels now. Upon my word, they have
brought me a mutton chop and a pot of beer.
Quite a little festival, to be sure. I must put an
end to my little memoir, and eat this before it
cools. A steak you can delay about, but the fat
on a chop becomes simply beastly as it cools, and
bits of white candle-grease float about in the
gravy.
* * *
I trust that the Rev. Mr. Browne will be
edified. A word with you, Browne, at parting.
You are an unattractive-looking man—long upper
lip, bad features. Take my advice, shave clean,
and look odd. You will still be a guy, but not
such an ordinary, helpless sort of guy. That little
weak moustache of yours is simply the most
wretched sort of thing, J.V. 1
THE EXILE.
The following touching and pathetic ballad was
found in a bottle at Circular Quay by one of our
staff. He saw it (the bottle) floating about with a
cork in it, and, conjecturing that it contained
something, secured and opened it, when he drew
out the manuscript. It is to be hoped the Govern-
ment will send out an expedition to rescue this
unfortunate exile before he dies of home-sickness.
The verses run as follows :
Shark Island is a pleasant place
For them that’s gay and free,
But Shark Island is a cruel place
For castaways like me.
By day and night I sadly gaze
Across the heaving foam
At the green slopes of Goat Island, for
Goat Island is my home.
I’ve written out my story, which
Should make a camel weep,
And I’ve coiked it in a bottle
Which I've cast upon the deep.
And I hope that some kind Christian
May pick it up, and try
To send a ship, or raft, or plank,
For the relief of I.
For seven long yea's I’ve lingered here,
With weeping almost blind.
I’ve hoisted handkechers and flags,
But no one seems to mind.
Gay oyster-parties used to land,
The oysters for to scoff,
But when I’d pray them take me on,
They’d only take me off.
Tom Biggins was the villain bold
T hat left me desolate,
And, which is hardest for to think,
Tom Biggins was my mate.
We owned a boat, that used to cruise
Around Goat Island coast.
And when 1 think of it I feel
As if I was a ghost.
We never went out far to sea,
But round the shore did creep,
Until, one bitter day for me,
We launched upon the deep.
Tom Biggins swore a fearful oath,
A wicked man was he,
“ Upon Shark Island we will land,
Or drownded we will be.”
I was in mortal terror, but,
Although I could not swim,
I knew ’twould be no kind’of use
To argufy with him.
The boat was launched, the sail was spread,
The wind came off the lee,
“ My native land, adoo! ” I cried —
And we were out at sea.
The waves the wind blew loud,
The boat ran free and fleet;
Tom Biggins like a demon sat
A-holdin’ the main sheet,
And when we struck a sea sometimes,
And in the waves would pour,
“ Bale out, you fool,” he’d cry.
Heavens! how Tom Biggins swore!
And once or twice he yelled aloud—
A fiendish yell had he —
“I’m goin’ to jibe !” Round went the boom.
A bitter jibe for me !
Oh, little landsmen know about
The perils of the deep,
For when the boom goes round like that
It knocks you in a heap.
But by the will of Providence
(I try to think it so !)
We landed on Shark Island, and
We let the kellick go.
“Go up! go up !” Tom Biggins said,
“ Go up, my own true mate ”
Tom Biggins, when he liked to, could
Be most affectionate.
“ Go up unto the island top.
And smoke, and take your ease,
And I will oysters gather till
We get a change of breeze.”
I had not been five minutes gone—
Five minutes, and no more—
When I beheld Tom Biggins—Oh.!—
A puttin’ off from shore.
“ Ha ! ha I” the villain shouted out,
“ Go and lie down again,
For I will sail your saucy boat,
And wed your Mary Jane I
“ Adoo 1” he cried, “ p’r’aps some day, when
A family we owns,
We’ll make a little party here —
To gather up your bones !”
I watched with stony eyes the boat,
As through the waves she swept.
And then- I’m not ashamed to own—
I laid me down and wept.
This is my tale, which I’ve put in
A bottle —to be brief —
Alas, I ne’er thought thus to have
To bottle up my grief.
And here for sev’n long years I ve been,
Through weather wet and dry,
A-sittin’ on a blessed rock,
And this has been my cry—
“ Shark Island is a pleasant place
For them that’s gay and free.
But Shark Island is a cruel place
For castaways like me.
“ I want to go away from here
Across the heaving foam.
To the green slopes of Goat Island, for
Goat Island is my home.”
Death of Dr. Strabismus.
From this world of unfinished investigation and
incomplete search after knowledge has pasted the
mott persevering analyst of one of our deformities.
I refer to what is generally called a “ squint.”
On the banks of the Castlereagh is a lonely grave
under a “budtha” tree, and in that grave lies
Jean Coquceil, who Anglicised his own name into
John Strabismus.
Having earned a pound by digging his grave,
his mate, “Scotty the Wrinkler,” became pos-
sessed of his notes, and handed them to me (or
the very moderate compensation of two tumblers
of beer, by Scotty yclept “ Twa loang sleevers."
A digest of the somewhat bulky volume may bo
interesting to the world, and a guide to any
scientist who may pursue the thread of the de-
parted doctor’s researches.
It seems that the Doctor was born in Lorraine,
and in the Franco-Prussian war received a knock
(from a dying soldier to whom he was attending)
on the left eye, which was dislodged from its
socket, and gave him the ghastly obliquity by
which he was afterwards distinguished. Being
an observer of Nature, he discovered that with the
cross-eye came crookedness of moral vision, and
from 1871 till the day of his death, April 1, 1887,
he has travelled far and wide always on the look-
out for squints in order to collect material for a
great work on Strabismus.
His book is full of narratives, of which I cull
three.
One day he was resting on the bank of the Dar-
ling when he heard cries from a clump of trees.
On approaching the spot he found a blackfellsw
drawit g an eye out of his lubra with a corkscrew,
whilst the tribe looked on in satisfied silence.
Having camped with them all night, he in vain
tried to get at their reason for the operation, until
just as they were departing, the king said in a
whisper, “ Gib it bacca ; mine tell all about that
vellow pull him eye.” From the mouth of black-
fellows and sucklings cameth wisdom, for he was
Informed : “ That pfallow gin got him cock-eyes.
Only got one now. Can’t even look cross. Mine
yan.”
Nothing annoys a squinter more than to be
called “cock-eye,” “squinny-eye,” “swivel-eye,”
&c. (It is strange that a man with one arm does
not object to be called “Wingy.”) This was
exemplified by a circumstance that occurred on
the Bulloo. The landlady of a bush shanty was
reclining on a sofa in the verandah, when
“ Warrigal Wolf,” a roughish bushman, came up,
and, not knowing her, said : “ Come on, Gimlet-
eye, and have a booze.” My lady at once vowed
that the insulter should never squint, and gouged
his right eye out with her scissors. Poor Warri-
gal said he thought she was a Cunnamulla siren
knocking down a cheque.
But the doctor s strangest experience was when
two horribly ugly young men each thought that
the other was mocking his squint 'J hey closed
and fought till one was knocked senseless, and,
strange to say, when he recovered he had lost his
squint.
Apparently Strabismus Coqumil comes to tha
following conclusions :
1. All persons cursed, whether from birth or
accident, by Strabismus, are morally oblique,
wrong, crooked, cross, or whatever you choose to
call it.
2. A very pronounced squint is not a sign of in-
tense wickedness. On the contrary, the strength
of one eye, or the habit of regarding objects with
alternate optics, tends to reduce the “ squinny ”
to the position of a gunner, boko, or one-eyed man,
3. The most dangerous is the boss-eye, that
calls for a second look for detection. His vil-
lainy is the same as the Tortoni’s beats In music,
i.e., when two notes approach one another so
closely that the sound-waves are amalgamated in
pulsations at regular intervals.
4. Swivel-eyed women are not so crooked as
boss-eyed men. The perversity of a woman's dis-
position is the homceopathoid dose that counteracts
the other evil. The doctor found 121 squinny-
eyed wives in the bush, and, without exception
they were faithful and hard-working. Only one
had a mate who was cross-eyed, and he was a
nigger. Of the 124, 91 were married to Germans,
and 31 to Irishmen, leaving the nigger and a
blind Scotchman to complete the tally.

OUR TROUBLES!
( A BIT OF BOHEMIA. )
Around us all the rags were spread—
The Shroud that caters for the dead,
The Noose, Mail, Rum, and those that shed
Their luminous effulgence
(Good words those last) on Sundays, glum
With savage gloom—that is the Rum—
Oh I d —<- these rhymes,
We mean the Times
And Sunday Nbws-(w6 can’t refuse
To take the names that rhyming come-
This slip claims your indulgence).
The papers all about us lay,
Ic was our little holiday,
We’d nought to do but loaf and play,
And watch the sunlight flicker
In gold and gray upon the heath—
Of course we mean the street beneath-
And watch the curling blue smoke wreath,
And drown ourselves in liquor.
We did it, too. Of course you smile,
D ,ar readers, and you chuckle while
Your little bosoms, full of guile,
And corned with evil-thinking,
Secrete the thought that never yet
A pressman’s thorax wasn’t wet
It he the slightest ohauce could get
To moisten it by drinking.
But such a charge is simply bluff,
We said we did it—that’s enough.
(Great Scott I this idiotic stuff
Is making us baldheaded.- Ed.)
Of course it is. The papers, then—-
(jBE-hoseph! there he goes again.- Ed.)
Daar me ! how literary men
Get cross when they get wedded !
Well, anyhow wo had bsen through
The papers one by one, and few
And very far between, as you
Yourselves perhaps have found it,
As plums in hash-house puddings placed,
In all that weary, dreary waste
We found the items that we chased—
But each one had around it
A wilderness of phrasey phrase.
And wordy words, and worn-out ways
Of saying things that in the days
Of Caedmon were archaic.
And introductions that had been
Stereotyped when Anne was queen,
To pars, that possibly were green
And fresh in the Ghaldaic.
Smug social siftings, raw and crude -
Police Court pars, in fashion rude,
That tell how ruffians fell “ imbrued
Their hands in infant gore.”
And here a banquet speech report
In bald old form. A smart retort
Some politician made-a sort
Of wit we’ve met before.
“ A well-known citizen”—“ of rain
A copious downpour ” again
We have to note the fact ” —“ with pain
We chronicle the loss”
Of some obscure and purse-proud ass.
And then “ with pleasure do we pass.”
These are fair samples of the class
You daily come across.
“ A fire broke out’ —“ a horse attached
To a milk-cart”—and “fairly matched
Were the antagonists’’—who “snatched"
Eftsoons, “ a brief repose.”
And heroines whose “ piercing glance
Plunges in dark alcoves ” —who “ lance
From “ orbs” a “ ray of fire ’’—enhance
The litany of woes 1
Each phrase is as a hopeless knell,
We curl up on our backs and yell
And shriek like all the friends of—well,
We’ll use no lurid figure.
And all the while the hired girl hums
(From Biloela fair she comes)
A little hymn, and twirls her thumbs,
And then proceeds to snigger.
She rather likes the show, poor thing.
She rather likes to see us fling
0 ar legs and arms about, and sing
Songs of dire desperation.
And presently she coolly saith :
“ ’E’ll stop when ’e gets out of breath ”
Oh ! this is worse than simple Death—
It’s Doubly-Damned Damnation I
What mud-head ruffian scrawls this screed
That causes strong men as they read
To lay the paper down, and plead
For respite or the tomb ?
What fiend flagitious thus attains
The sum of human woes and pains
At one fell swoop? What addled brains
Excogitate this gloom ?
I ord knows I but we have seen a wight
Of woeful mien—a thing of Night
\nd Chaos—an embodied fright—
A fiend of fearsome feature,
Who looks just what you might expect
The wretch to be who could affect
This kind of rot. And we suspect
This awsome, eldreitch creature.
He busted up our holiday,
Wo had no heart to drink or play
This gruesome ghoul must have his way—
• We took to objurgation.
We cursed him with a crimson curse—
'Twould never do to put in verse
1 The - language,- picturesque yet terse,
We used on that occasion* -
CAIN’S CURSE.
It is noon in the North, and the perishing glare
Of the summer sun falls on the flat, brown and
bare;
The ridges of ironstone are smitten with heat,
And as quicksand the dust in the tent-bordered
street;
From the near Table Mountain the fervid beam
plays,
And strikes on the valley its focussing rays
In pitiless sequence, as flre-laden darts
To the dusted brown leaves of the dull ironbarks ;
But there's life in the Flat in the red drought’s
despite,
For the Yellow King waveth his sceptre of might,
And the sturdy gold-seeker is joyous indeed.
For the red flag is up at the foot of the lead.
There is bustle and life, and a rush to and fro,
The lifted pick falls era it striketh the blow,
And the whip-horse stands sweltering there in the
sun,
For the diggers are off down the Flat, every one,
And the horse-thief and gaffer and bummer are
glad
Their prospect is fair whosoever’s is bad—
And they join the emeute, for an opening agape,
With the castaway pick and the fraudulent tape.
And Bluestone, the lord of the gay “Digger’s
Rest,”
In his yellow-white shirt and his buttonless vest,
Stands idly in front of his vacant abode,
While in spirit ho pans a pound-weight to the
load.
Ho I Jezebel there in the bottle-decked bar 1
Reloice for the rise of the Gold-seekers' star!
Hoi slipshodden syren, whose ethics are nought—
Or, as good people say, “hardly quite as they
ought” -
Go, put off the unkempt and ill-fitting brown,
And put on thy “flashest” and brightest gay
gown 1
Go, muster the frowsy and loose-hanging trass,
Put on the loud trinket and death-dealing dress 1
Go, furbish thy form in the cracked mirror’s sight,
For a harvest of gold shall thy smiles win to-
night.
11.
Away down by the mullock-mound’s sinuous files,
Long reft of the wash-dirt heap’s glittering piles,
Where the rude windlass cross-beam—the rotted
log slides.
Surmounting th.o gut tod shaft s timborloss sld6B 5
Past the tail of the lead where the duffers are
Farther yet, by the bend of the Half-a-mile Blank,
Where a thousand men bustle and rush to and fro,
Stands the pioneer windlass of Warrlgal Joe.
Tall, comely, and lithe, clear, blue-eyed, and fair,
His sinewy arms, brown, tensioned, and bare,
Heave the rude windlass handle in slow, measured
round,
Till the wash-laden bucket appears from the
ground,
Then deftly unhooked, with a well-measured
sweep,
And emptied. Below I 'tis a hundred feet deep,
And an idler or two by the mullock-heap stand,
And the fast-growing wash-pile is furtively
scanned
At a distance, for all seem to tacitly know
That there’s weight in the arm of Warrigal Joe.
Down the Fiat, where the surface dip stands for a
Of the gutter's true course, called the “Right
Fancy Line,”
To the quartz pitted ridges which show the bed-
rock.
Every spece is peg bounded in block upon block |
And vo'ces disputing, fierce, angry, and loud,
Tell the jumper’s at work ’mid the gold-seeking
crowd.
And louder in anger the Babel sounds grow
Till the quick-coming climax—a blow for a blow,
And Warrigal, pricking his ears at the sound.
Heaves his grimed, sweating mate from the depths
of the ground,
And then with an oath, a rush, and a spring
He stands in the midst of the improvised ring 1
There s a lull in the clamour, Joe s resonant voice
Rings clearly and loud as he speaks to the boys:
*• Shall we suffer the bully and thief to go round
And jostle some poor devil out of his ground,
For a hair-shortened peg, or an inch of the tape,
Because’’—with a grim look—“ perhaps he can
shape. .. .
We know ‘ Yellow Jimmy, his gang and his game,
But, by G—d lif we let ’em, on us be the blame/’
And for answer to Joe comes a ringing “ hooray I”
Which the crooked crowd's champion hears with
dismay,
For he thinks of a time - not a twelvemonth ago—
When an ounce Snider pallet from Warrigal Joe
Whizzed closa to his ear as he muffled the bell
Of Joe’s petted thoroughbred “Silvery Nell,”
And with eyes gleaming malice he turns round to
go,
Yawing terrible vengeance on Warrigal Joe.
111.
In the bar of old Bluestone’s the revels are loud,
And the glasses are clinked by the “ Golden hole”
crowd, . ~
The jest, spiced with ribaldry, files to and fro,
As “shout” follows “shout" and the liquor taps
flow.
The landlord dispenses his sycophant wiles,
The barmalden metes out her flycatching smiles.
For the gold-dust and nuggets are falling like hail
As the plethoric “shammy ” uptllts in the scale.
And Jezrbe 1 , tawdry, bedizened, and gay,
Passes smiling around with the glass-laden tray,
And her glib lepartee give# a joy and a zest
To the laugh chorus hailing the half-naked jest,
In hurrying sequence the rattling sound
Of the ivory cubes as the box passes round,
And the words half-coherent, the wavering hand,
Speak the maddening work of the pare “ Hell-fire
brand; ” .
As the sense-slayirg fumes of the fell liquors rise
Louder, faster the smutted profanity flies ;
0 ! for manhood’s fair instincts’tis little theyreck,
Else the frail woman’s presence might offer a
check.
There’s a brawl in the bar-room, the poker school
clan ~ . , . „
Bandy blows for the spoil of a golden-hole lamb,
And Bluestone, in tremor, stands watchfully nigh
With fear and appeal in his small, cunning eye,
While wild Yellow Jimmy, of ironhand rule,
Arranges the squabble by scooping the pool.
And he struts to the bar in the pride of his might—
For the star of his luck has shone brightly to-
L night.
Come, Jezabel, bow to the shrine of success ; _ |
Where’s your smile to acknowledge the champion s
address ?
From your maudlin admirers his prowess will
save,
And the fair should most certainly favour the
brave.
SmaU matter to you though the hue of his pelt
Shows the intermixed s'rain of the Myall and Celt,
It his lip be too fall, or his brow should slope
Or his nude, savage mother be shameless and
black—
Full of muscular manhood, of sinew and vim,
Daep-chested and keen-eyed and shapely of limb,
You had favoured his suit not a short week ago
Ere your ■■mile met the blue eye of Warrigal Joe.
But the way of the siren is fickle and strange,
For the smile that is venal is boundless of range,
And she lords it o’er all while her presence is new
With a rule that Is queenly where women are few.
’TIs vainly the champion her countenance seeks,
In vain his rough c urt with profanity reeks;
The smile that was his is now kept for his foe —
The stalwart prospector —now Golden-hole Joe.
There’s a lull in the many-tongued b acchanal roar,
And a champing of bit-irons is heard at the door,
And a kindly voice speaking, “ Wol steady, old
pet,
And we’ll travel directly, so mind you don’t fret.”
How Jezebel brightens—she knows the sounds
well —
'T.s her “Warrigal" new love and Silvery
Nell.'
O, Warrigal 1 evil’s the destiny’s star
That guides you this eve to the Diggers’ Rest bar.
Oh 1 why as a moth to the treacherous light
Have you come to the spot where your foe is
to-n’ght ?
For a murderous thought in his moody brain lies,
Tnere is green-eyed revenge in his small, wolfish
eyes;
There’s a sting in each feathery shaft of your
“ chaff,”
There’s a mock in the tones of her welcoming
laugh,
To rouse up the malice that morbidly broods,
And to raise in his dark mind the time-buried
feuds.
Why, Jezebel, cruelly flippant of speech.
Why, tawdry she-flend, why widen the breach ?
O. why the loud whisper in Warrigal’s ear,
With its sting as a scorpion’s, “that blackfellow
thoro ? **
For scarce hath the devil-hatched sentence been
said . ,
When crash! went a bottle at Warrigal s head.
Thank thy stars that theiill-potent “ triple-hell ”
brand
Has been sapping the strong nerve, unsteadied the
hand,
Or a knell had been rung by the sound of that
blow, . ,
And on your head the blood of poor Warrigal Joe.
Thy scream, shallow woman, availeth thee
nought
To stay the fell work by thy poisoned tongue
wrought;
There's a spring toward each other —two dull-
sounding blows
As the maddened antagonists vengefully close
Two strong men are pitted in brief battle shock,
A moment, then down in a vengeful death-lock.
IV.
Hurrah! round the camp now the news travels
fast:
That the long-standing quarrel has headed at last,
For the Flat has been dull since the fifty-round
“ mi ll ."
When “Ned the Condenser” fought “Copper
Nose Bill.”
Hurrah ! for the claret in slulceheads must flow
When big Yellow Jimmy meets Warrigal Joe.
In front of the “Rest" where the crowd gathers
fast . . , .
The seconds have pitted the champions at last,
And grimly determined is each as he strips,
Their eyes lit with hatred, comprest are the Ups;
The half caste is first like a panther in wait,
Now Warrigal’s poised on the knee of his mate,
Bach thirsting for blood. Now “ Time ”is the
word,
And the battle commences with savage accord.
Now Warrigal! caution I so 1 steady ! beware !
For the Yellow Boy’s grip is like that of a bear;
He is trained to close work-in the poker-school
brawls ...
He has mastered the bone-breaking science of
“falls”;
The fell liquor quickens his hot blood to-night,
The man who would face him must know how to
fight.
In the ring he has never been matched with his
peer,
Save his own iron-framed father—a stout pioneer.
But Warrigal watches each wile of his foe’s,
And foils his wild rush with his sledge-hammer
blows,
And the shouts of “Time!” “Timel” pass in
wearisome round
As, first one. then the other, is raised from the
ground,
And, puppet-like, set on a quick-readied knee.
While the rival crowds cheer in their partisan
glee,
And the red stream that follows the rally and
lunge
Is mopped from their eyes with the bar-towel
“ sponge,”
As quick recommences the wavering fight
By the guttering candle's dim flickering light.
Thud 1 thud ! there’s a rally, a rush for a dote,
And a fierce give-and-take ’twixt the furious fOt,s,
There's a shout of hurrah I See the Yellow Boy
“jibs!”
Mark the livid hued wale on his massive, short
ribs 1
His short gasping breaths tell his gamesome heart
That heavy round-hander has done it; he reels
Down heavily, covered with blood, sweat, and
grime ;
Ho! the fights here, the water will fetch him to
time.
But the sponge or the water may now not avail,
One hand is pressed hard on the lived-hued wale,
A twitching of anguish about his mouth plays,
The half-ol''s6d eyes is fast growing aglize.
The cheers of the rival crowd die in his ear,
’Tis the last earthly sound that he ever may hear ;
One spasmodic heave of the labouring chest
And the muscular frame is for ever at rest.
And the victor is still as the face of the dead
While the shirt is drawn over his blood-clotted
bead.
He shares not the joy of the friends at his side,
Nor heeds he ihe plaudits of factional pride ;
And they look in his face with a feeling of fear
Whi’e he’s helped to the back of the silyer-manei
mure.
And he stares at the dead oer the heads of the
crowd,
And in hollow voice speaks as if dreaming aloud :
“ O Christ! where's thy vengeance for what I
have done ?
For this night I have murdered my own father’s
son,
With the blood of a brother my foul hand is red,
God J God; let thy heavy curse fall on my head,
Come, Nelly! the tussle was only boy’s play,
The daylight will catch us, come, let us away !
Away from the blood-drops that rain in my sight,'
And his galloping hoof-sounds are lost in the
night.
Y.
The three-quarter moon sheds her fast-paling
light,
The faint glow of dawn ends the tropical night;
The pale russet streaks catch the plume coloured
ray
Till the sclntlllant morning star hides in the grey.
But the morning light falls on a drought-stricken
land
Of bleached stony ridges or whits powdered sand,
Where the perished earth’s crust is seamed,
shrunken, and baked,
And its thirst for God’s rain seems ever unslaked.
The sunrise, foretelling a Aercely hot day,
Beglamours the waste with its blood-coloured ray,
But it wakens no life in the somnolent earth ;
It taps not the springs of the forest-bird's mirth,
It falls on the bronze of the brigalow clump?,
It touches the fire-swept spinifex stumps,
But it gleams on no water for Afty miles back.
For this is the dry desert Ninety-mile Track.
The carrion bird pauses not here in his flight,
The wild dog has fled from the spot in affright,
The sand-freighted whirlwind’s the one breeze
that blows
On the ill-omened track where the poison bush
grows,
For red-handed Death rulath here in his might,
And striketh all things with his perishing blight,
And the pitiless drought-flend bends to his nod
Till it seemeth abandoned of mere ini God.
Christ pity the horseman who cometh this way
To face the flercs beam of the tropical day,
Whose b’oodshotten eye glancsth back in affright
On the deep-sanded furrow he's travelled all
night!
God pity ihe man in the depth of his need
Who urgeth the dust-covered, dry-sweated steed,
Whose dull leaden eye speaks of vigour that’s
gone,
For ihe Sweetwater valley is forty miles on !
And the Sweetwater vale is a tawny-hued land
Whose life has been sucked by the thirsting white
sand,
And its bed is a charnel-place, foal with the
breath
Of the pestilent rdours of sun-shrivelled death,
Where the jackal-like dingo is sleek from bis feast
On the sparse-covered bones of the drought-
perished beast—
For all life else has gone from the land with its
green,
Save the hornet that wings where the last drop
has been.
God pity the horseman, whoever he be,
For the sheen of the water he never may see.
Now the red sun of noon, from a copper-hue’d sky,
May glare without hurt in his dull, lifeless eye,
And the foul carrion crow that has tracked him
all day
May flap its black wing o’er the “ silvery grey,”
As it sounds, with its raven-like croakings of
woo.
The dirge of the fratricide Warrigal Joe.
And the tranced land shall wake with a marvel-
ous bound
When the blest summer rainfalls shall sweeten
the ground,
When the flood waters rush like a wave of the
deep,
And the sun-smitten, sewer-like waterholes sweep;
And the tender green herbage like magic shall
spring,
And the drought-banished bush bird shall hither-
ward wing ;
But the first rushing waters shall bear as they go
The bones of the fratricide Warrigal Joe.

To the Manager Australian Gas Co.
Limited.
Dear Sir,—l was unpleasantly surprised to read
your letter,
And much regret that I must be for many weeks
your debtor;
I do not own the cash, and so
I cannot pay you what I owe
Until —the times are better.
Your threatened action worries me, and makes
me ponder sadly,
That short of funds your firm must be to thus
behave so badly;
But send your man, and when I've learned
How many cubic feet I’ve burned,
Some day I’ll pay you gladly,
I came; the gas was hers laid on, and so
thought I’d try it ;
I did not think—your hair keep on—that I should
have to buy it.
You really make my dander rise—
Turn off my gas! Well, d n your eyes !
Your threat, sir, I defy it.
You think I cannot do without the gas you sell so
dearly,
And if I do not scad a note you’ll cut it off—well,
really,
Just think again ; it’s too absurd !
Such foolish talk was never heard—
A childish notion, merely.
And I’ll be soon lef c in the dark—o, terrible pre-
diction !
Without a solitary spark to lighten my affliction 1
Ha I there appears upon the scene
An angel bright called Kerosene
(This is poetic Action).
You will not bust me with your gas, yet think I’d
be so rash, sir,
To prove myself a silly ass and trust you with my
cash, sir;
You must think me a “ messer.
Fair sir, farewell 1 There, quiet now !
Once more within this manly brow
I will not pay your bill, I vow.
Yours truly,
THE PROFESSOR.


The N.S.W. Art Society’s Exhibition.
The Art Society of N.S.W. is at present holding
l a eighth annual Exhibition, but why the work
of artists resident in Australia should be described
as Australian art, we are at a loss to imagine.
Of all Australian artists, Johnstone alone ranks as
a genuine interpreter of Australian incident and
scenery, and his pictures command in America
hundreds of guineas. The artists at present
exhibiting m’ght with justice be described as
exponents of European rather than Australian
art, and the Exhibition might with propriety bo
held in Bond-street, London. Some of the woik
is very good indeed, and would not discredit ary
ordinary art exhibition anywhere. The mistake
i 8 mide in claiming for it an Austral'an character
M. Henry’s realistic painting of Waratahs is one
among the most conspicuous pictures which arres
the eye of the visitor upon entering the room
It is a perfect blaze of colour, but it seems tohav
been painted under two impulses. The upper
portion is strong, careful, and solid ; the lowei,
ideal and transparent. Beyond its teohmoa
aeouracy, however, we must confess to a fee-
ing of disappointment that M. Henry has done
nothing of a more humanly appealing charade*
Shmor Nerliis undoubtedly the best represent* d
among Sydney artists at the Exhibition. Hiu
Orgie” is a bold sketch in colour.
but his bacchanals avggest the ba.f clad ballet o
the French opera rather than one of those sen-
suous myths of ancient Greece. The vase inter-
ieoted into this picture, too, seems who ly out o.
harmony with the remainder of the composition,
and the lily-bosomed pool in the foreground help .
•h nnmViat “Iq Transgression ’ belongs to a
»*O.l «< but.
notwithstanding, the suggested love-light and
roguery in the girl’s eyes, which are concealed by
her hat, is happy. Nerli’s “ Portrait of Lenoionl
is one of his most fortunate efforts , his Eighty-
seven Years” is hurried and somewhat careless
“Renose” the figure of a black-satin-draped
woman against a flaming background, is startiing
nnd b’zarre Its title is a misnomer, and, not-
withstanding a deal of oarafnl and elaborate
work, Its effect is irritating. In two very badly

weird little bit of eun-bllgbted pla'n with its
fadeless melancholy gum-trees, in another a sug-

[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
Hail, Regal Lie, and Priestly Lie!
Ye flourish passing well;
Tis strange, O'Lies, ye both such fair
And seemly show should outward bear
From roots in lowest hell.
Right pleasant in our kingly sight
The ranks of war appear ;
Nor golden flood that seaward flows,
Nor valley decked with Sharon’s rose,
Hath half the charm of tender light
Of Morn, that tips with splendour bright,
The thriee accursed spear.
Right pleasant in our priestly sight
Is, aye, the martyr’s pyre.
Nay, prate ye not of jasper sea,
Of battlements that crystal be ;
How pale they by the ruddy glare
Of flame that licks the faggot fair
Our faith’s avenging Are.
And do ye bid mankind rejoice
That ye have lived so long ?
The martyr’s groan, the captive’s sigh,
The widow’s wail, the orphan s cry,
The battle yell, the cannon peal,
The clash of fratricidal steel.
Would mingle with the song.
Away, away—ye Curses twain !
Your sway is soon no more.
What stately footfall strikes mine ear I
The myriad hosts ef Truth are near,
They come, they come, with stately tread
0 King, O Priest, your day is dead,
Your sun of glory o’er
A-Y.
Britain’s Uncle Pumblechook.
The Carnarvon banquet, held at Sydney Parlia-
mentary Houses last Monday, was a weary
repetition of the Carnarvon banquet everywhere
else. With considerable forethought, it was ar-
ranged that only three speeches were to be de-
livered, and, as the speakers selected were all of
the ultra-Tory order, any obtrusive democrats
who, like the Victorian Higinbotham, might be
inclined to carp and criticise, could only listen to
the flow of drivel without any chance of reply.
Most of them stayed away in consequence, and
the result was a gathering of 74 legislators, out of
a total of 180 or thereabouts, and a muster, a l l
told, of 84 perfect gentlemen and John Haynes.
Sir John Hay proposed the health of the Governor,
and the Baron wno went back on the Smiths re-
cited the speech which had been prepared for him.
It wasn’t a long one, but it was as much as h*s
secretary dare trust him with. Parkes rose next,
and recited everything that Carnarvon had done
ever since he was a boy, and then Carnarvon
whooped himself up, and plunged into ihe arid
w.ld of p'atitudes which ware old and stale
before this heavy-going Pamblocaook was
born. The love of Australia for England—
the fact that Australia can’t live without England
(how on earth eo many little Republics live
peacefully without England Britain’s Uncle Pum-
bleohook did not explain)—the fondness of Austra-
lia for her lavin’ Queen—the fact that when Eng-
land goes to war it can rely on Australia, and the
beauty of the circumstance that England, relying
on Australia, can bark louder in Europe than
England with no Australia to rely on—the loveli-
ness of all this, and the point that the Soudan
goat and donkey “ woke an echo ” throughout
the world, also the urgent necessity of passing
the Naval Defence BUI. all swept before the
audience in dizzy review. The additional faofi
that an Australian possessed the advantages of
British protection in all ptrts of the world was
laid down and hammered in, and the other facts
that the Germans are Insulting and plundering
British subjects in Samoa, that some two years
ago the Russians seized a clerk belonging to a
British Consulate in Persia, and flogged him
almost to death, and that the blustering Govern-
ment of London rarely dares even to remonstrate
except in the case of such countries as
Ejypt or Guatemala, were altogether l*?ft
out. And then an asinine Daily Telegraph
compositor tailed on behind the report the follow-
ing verse which, from its position, would seem to
have some connection with the dismal feel and
the still more dismal slush which accompanied
it :
“ And I believe the devil's voice
Sinks deeper in our ear
Than any whisper sent from heaven,
However sweet and clear.'*
This is rather rough on Carnarvon's voice, but for
once the Sydney D.T. has struck the truth by
accident.

children he is unsurpassed anywhere.
The other day Thomas Sun Lee Sing, of
Ravenswood (Q ), was gathered Into the fold, and
his pig-tinted visage is now the countenance of
a Briton by Act of Parliament. Thomas Sing
has also taken to himself a white, wife, and, by
way of adding to his joy, the Ravenswood Mining
Journal printed the following abject slush re-
garding him
We are informed that Thomas Sun Lee Sing, our worthy
naturalised British subject, has received a copy of record of
oath of allegiance. We congratulate him upon the mag-
nanimity of our Governor, and we sincerely hope that not-
withstanding the promises of our Premier in the Assembly,
that no more Chinese would be naturalised, our worthy Go-
vernor will not allow himself to be governed by our un-
worthy Government, and that many more Asiatics will be
received in our midst. The future white population of
Northern Queensland will require the assistance of the
Celestial race to keep them in the prosperous state they are
now io, and the present is the time to enlarge the inter-
course between the races.
From this pronouncement we gather that there is
in Northern Queensland one seemingly white man
who is prepared to admit that he can’t get on
without Chinese assistance -who has fallen so low
that he must have a Chow to hold him up. It is,
indeed, a pitiable position to be in.
A Victorian paper has come into possession
of an idea, and the unexpectedness ot ihe thing
nearly blew its head off. New South Wales, it
points out, wants a new name badly, and it also
requires two and a half millions to wipe off its
shortages, and the idea is that the name, if pro-
parly looked after, ought to bring in the amount
needed, and thus throw two stones at one bird for
the benefit of the general public. For instance,
if the colony were described in future as “Hop-
bittersiana,” the advertisement would be one that
would be well worth three millions at the least,
and an extra million might be raised by throwing
in the privilege ot advertising on the hacks of
Acts of Parliament, dog-licenses, gas-receipts, and
Hansard. Another considerable rise might bo
made by re-christening Sydney “ Hollowayspllls-
adelphia,” and other patent-medicine proprietors
would doubtless pay liberally on condition that
their nostrums were mentioned in the body of
every Bill introduced into Parliament, or run
into proclamations, say, after this fashion
“Victoria, by the grace of (Cookie’s PjUs)
God (Is. a box, beware of fraudulent
imitations), of Great Britain (Smith’s horse medi-
cine), and Ireland, Queen (to be obtained from all
chemists) Defender of the Faith (none genuine
without the proprietor’s name blown in the
bottle), and Empress of India,” &0., &c. This
would not only make Parliamentary documents a
source of profit, but would considerably lighten
the dreary pages of the Government Gazette,
and the scheme might be turned to private, as
well as public uses. Any enterprising firm in
existence would pay Parkes's debts right off if he
would undertake to rise in the House once a day
and exclaim, in hollow sepulchral tones: “ Try
Boshlter's Hair Restorer," or, “ Get your pants
from Moses,” and Mr. Wise might easily make up
tor those lost patent fees by the same device.
There are whole heaps of money in this project,
and the one thing that surprises us is that it has
not been adopted long ago.
COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON
ARE NO GOOD
To those who are too 111 to enjoy them. The sub-
joined list of ladies and gentlemen, however, enjoy
their holidays this season right heartily. Why
this season? Because they are now well, and
enter into enjoyment with a zest unknown to
those whose livers of all their anatomy is holy-
daying, whose kidneys are on a strike, and whose
stomach “ gives it up” at the slightest suggestion
of food. Kindly read the following extracts from
letters from your friends and neighbours, follow
their advice, and without doubt 1888 will be to
you “ A Happy New Year ” indeed.
BRIGHT’S DI3EA.SB.
SAMUEL BABFORD (Exploration Hotel), Mel-
bourne. —“In Ootober, 1886,1 caught a severe
cold, which culminated in pains all over me,
and I was obliged to take to my bed. From
bad I went to worse. I constantly bled at the
nose, and could not keep anything on my sto-
mach, nob even soda and milk. Tne pains in
my head and back were excruciating. I
called a physician, who examined me, and
said I was suffering from congestion of the
lungs, and dcciored me accordingly, yet I con-
tinued to grow worse. I than first noticed
my ankles and legs were swelling, and that
they would * dent ’on impression. I had five
physicians altogether, but none of them,
except the last one, really told me what w» r
the matter with me, although I was paying a
guinea a visit. After I had been ill about
seven weeks, my body began to swell to an
alarming extent, and a cold sweat covered
mo, with a sour and most disagreeable odor.
My fluids were very rcanty, high coloured,
and voided with much pain. My left arm
swelled eut of all semblance to an arm, a sorb
of watery bag forming and falling down on
the under side. Across my back and hips was
another appendage like a saddle bag In form,
so large I could shake it. I could not get on
the trousers I usually wore, and so puffed
out was my stomach and bowels with water
that I could only button the two top buttons
of my waistcoat My face was so puffed
that I could scarcely see out of my eyes,
wh'ch ran water to such an extent that my
pillow was constantly wet. I had a pair of
slippers made to order, they were 12 s in
length, and big every way proportionately;
yet I had to slit them open before I could get
them on. The bleeding from the nose con-
tinued, also the vomiting, with dreadful
retching, while my head felt as though it
wasinavyca. I wanted to die, as life was
only misery. A day or two before Christmas
the doctor told my wife there was no hope for
me, that I could not live until morning :
that I had acute Bright’s disease in it’s worst
form, and he would not call again unless sent
for. The day fol'owiog I was alive, and
having my attention called to an article on
Bright's disease in a local paper, recom-
mending ‘ Warner’s Safe Cura,’ I told my
wife to get a bottle, and let me try it as a last
resort. She did so. The first dose I kept
down—something remarkable. The second
dose likewise—wonderful The third dose I
vomited. I then diluted the medicine, and
persevered. The next day I ceased vomiting,
and had an appetite. From that day on I
have not vomited, and have relished my food
The doctor, probably believing me dead, never
called again. The swelling all over my
I body gradually went down. My hair came
out, great scales peeled off my legs, and I
seemed to be renewed throughout. My normal
weight is from 12sb. to 13st, bub when I was so
swelled I must have weighed at least 16it. I
can now put my slit slippers on over my boots,
and wear my c.othes oace more, the dropsical
swellirg having entirely disappeared. About
the Ist tf March, 1887, I could get on my
feet for a short lime, and thereafter gradually
gained in strength, so that I could take short
walks. Now I feel that my young manhood
has come back to me. My friends jocularly
call me * Cheat the Grave,’ and I feel that I
have done so in truth. I never expected to
get well, and now that I have completely re-
covered, I cannot say enough in praise of the
medicine that brought me back to life, health,
and strength."
DROPSY.
CHRISTIAN REUTTBR (Numbi, Shoalhaven),
N.S.W.—“It is now about 14 years since I
had to seek relief from the water which
gathered in my bedy. I consulted a doctor,
who told me that I had a watery tumour in
my stomach, and that he could do nothing for
me, except taking the water away by tapping.
He said the case was incurable, unless I con-
sented to an operaiion, to which I refused. I
was then tapped, and 16 quarts of water
taken away. I consulted other doctors in
Sydney to no effect, and was compelled to be
tapped every five or six months, the quantity
taken away each time averaging from 15 to
18 quarts. I was tapped altogether 24 times,
and had lost all hops of recovery. I then
heard of ‘ Warner’s Safe Cure,’ and com-
menced its use as my last chance . It acted
most miraculously in my case, and after tak-
icg eight bottles a cure was effected, although
I continued taking it, until I had taken 11
bottles. At the present writing it is five
months since the cure was effected, and no
sign of any water settling in my body. I can
with great confidence therefore recommend
‘ Warner's Safe Cure’ and ‘Warner’s Safe
Pills.’ ”
KIDNEYS and LIVER.
JAMES SNEDKN (Edward-street, Summer Hill),
Sydney, N.S.W.—“ For 12 months I suffered
violent racking pains in the back and loins,
accompanied with a burning sensation ex-
tending through the urinary passages, and
constant desire, and straining effort to urinate,
the fluid, however, coming away in small
quantities, frequently mixed with dark sandy
substances. Language fails to describe the
agony I suffered. I was under four Sydney doc-
tors who entirely failed to give me relief. I then,
on the recommendation of friends, purchased
a bottle of ‘ Warner’s Safe Cure ’ with a vial
of ‘ Warners Safe Pills,’ and the result, thank
God, was surprising indeed, for the first bottle
removed the pain, and the secretions of the
kidneys quickly resumed a natural colour and
quantity. I continued with the medicine,
and took some 25 bottles of 4 Warner’s Safe
Cure,* and about 10 vials of 4 Warner’s Safe
Pills.’ I have ever since kept active and un ■
unusually strong."
KIDNEYS and LIVER.
EDWARD CLA.RY (66 G mrge-street, W.
Sydney, N.S.W.—“For several years pass)
suffered from chronic constipa: ion, and serious
disease of the kidneys. In the latter two
years my cor dition grew so bad that I dis-
paired of my life. I had fearful pains in the
back and sides, and when passing water 1
had a scalding sensation; my fluid was full
of greasy froth. During the past two years
my pains had so wrecked my constitution,
that I became clean bent on my left side, and
/or two years walked lop-sided. I was under
five leading Sydney doc .irs, but they were
baffled by my disease, and quite unable to
render aid. Last year I jrmured ‘Warner’s
Safe Cure.’ The first two bottles gave me
ease, relieved my pains, and proved a power-
ful stimulant to the digestive organs, liver
and kidneys. Whan I had taken four or fisre
battles all pain had left me, and ever since I
can walk upright. I have now altogether
taken 10 bottles of ‘ Warner’s Safe Cure,’ oc-
casionally with ‘ Warner’s Safe Pills,’ and
they have effected, a thorough cure, while
other remedies and five leading doctors failed
to cure me,"
( DIABETES
MRS. M. B. SNBLSON (Pemberton House,
Macauleystreet), Albury, N.S W.—For
about five years I was suffering from some
disease, and could not find out what was
wrong until the month of June last. The
disease bad arrived at such a stage that caused
me very much alarm, my doctor told me at
the time that I was suffering from Sugar
Diabetes. I was recommended to try
‘ Warner’s Safe Diabetes Cure,’ and am very
thankful to say that after taking five bottles
it proved most beneficial, and after taking 23
bottles the specific gravity of my urine was
reduced from 1 050 to 1 032, and I firmly be-
lieve that two more bottles will effect a per-
fect cure."
CALCULUS.
W. F, DAVIES (Rose street, Darlington), Sydney,
N.S.W. —“I suffered from Stone in tie
Bladder, more or less for the past 11 years, at
times being very bad, and suffering great
pain. Was treated in both schools, but with
no permanent effects. In November 1886 I
was compelled to take to my bed alto-
gether. In December I underwent an
operation where by a stone was crushed
and taken away after which I suffered
almost beyond endurance. I laid in bed for
two months, scarcely able to move, and almost
without sleep, suffering excruciating pain
every time I was obliged to urinate. I had
given up all hope. At last, merely to gratify
a friend, I began the use cf ‘ Warner’s Safe
Cure,’ and ‘ Warner's Safe Pills,’ and from
the first, noticsd a decided change for the
better. Large quantities of gritty substance
passed from me ; I felt better and kept on
with the medicine. After taking nine bottles
of the ‘ Safe Cure,’and two vials of ‘Safe
Pills,’ I fully recovered, and I can eurely say
that I owe my life to ‘ Warner’s Safe Reme-
dies.’ I can now return to business, have
gained three stone in weight, and feel perfectly
well."
REV. H. PATTINSON (Rochester), Victoria.—
“I have suffered greatly at intervals for the
past 3 years frtm Kidney Disease and Stone
in the Bladder. I tried various remedies, and
got advice from two or three doctors, but
nothing I tried gave me more than temporary
relief. Frequently when away from home,
attending to my pastoral duties, have I sud-
denly been seized with a violent pain in my
b ck and right side, extending through the
groin and hip joints, which would almost
bring me double, and cause the cold perspira-
tion to pour from my bedy. These attacks
were becoming more frequent and more severe
each time. I would have to pass through
from 24 to 36 hours of the most excruciating
pain before I could get any relief from the
use of bran poultices, hot flannels, &o , and
I would be left in such a weak state, that
before I gained a little strength I would be
seized with another attack. A day or two
before these attacks the urine voided would
be as pale as clear water, but suddenly it
would change to a high colour, and after
standing a little while would be about one-
third briokdust. At these times it was
generally scanty, and was voided with pain.
My life was becoming one of misery, and I
was minting seriously of giving up the work
of the ministry. I became wretchedly thin,
and to my friends as well as myself it be-
came evident that I was not long for this
woild. I had heard a gooddeat about ‘War-
ner's Safe Care,’ but never made up my mind
to try it until advised by our chairman, Rev.
S. P. Webber, who wrote me a letter stating
what benefit he had received. I bought
three bottles and some pills and commenced
taking them according to directions. The
first bottle made me very ill; I was not in
much pain, but passed a large quantity cf
blood. This continued at intervals for about
a fortnight, when I passed away a small
stone, and was greatly relieved. From that
time I began to recover rapidly, and after
taking about 14 bottles of ‘ afb Cure,’ and
six vials of afe Pills, I feel quite well
again; work has become a pleasure again, and I
have been able to conduct nine weeks of
special services, apart from my ordinary
work. I used to suffer from Indigestion
and had a poor appetite. lean now sit up,
at table and enjoy a meal thoroughly, and I
feel none of the bad effects afterwards as I
used to do. All this has been wrought sicca
last Easter, and I trust it will be permanent,
as I have every reason to believe it will. I
feel it my bounden duty to recommend ‘ War-
ner’s Safe Cure ’ and ‘ Warner’s Safe Pills
to all who may be suffering from the same
complaint as I have been.”
LACK OF SPACE.
Prevents us giving more testimonials in full, but
we are assured by Messrs. H. H. Warner & Co.,
the proprietors of “Warner’s Safe Remedies"
that they have thousands of them, which
illustrate beyond doubt the high character of
these medicines.

-s the Latest Novelty in the Photographic World. It is small, strong, very simple, handsomely got
- up and atrociously effective both on friends and on enemies. Six circular pictures, each about the
size of a crown piece, can be taken on one plate with most astonishing speed and perfect accuracy.
This Camera can be worn under a coat or dress, the lens projecting through a button-hole cannot be
obeerved, and the simple action of prilling a cord hands down to either reverence or ridicule every
Incident included within the scope of its vision. The Camera is not a toy, but a
really serviceable instrument of the class known as DETECTIVE Cameras. At the same time
an Immense amount of fun can be got out of it, and photographs of people and things obtained with
ease which are practically impossible by any other method. A limited number only have been
imported by ns, and they are well worth the attention of the general public*

The subject of the above sketch, Mr. P. R. Lar-
kin, of the Prince ot Wales Hotel, 778 and 780
George-s'raet (South) Sydney, has been a resident
of the ciry for a period of 25 years, and is row
well known t s one of the largest wine and spirit
merchants in New South Wales. la the whole-
sale department of hia business the visitor is
amazed at the amount of on hand;
tier atter tier ot cases, all containing the best and
choicest wines and spirits, from all parts of the
world, at d shelves reaching from floor to ceiling
stocked with every known brand from which are
made up Mr Larkin s famous £3 cases. The cel-
lars attached are the largest in the N.S.W. capi-
tal, and the proprietor by way cf celebrating the
cen’enary, bar rdded to his hotel one ot the
finest select bars in the colony. A first-
class refreshment reem for ladies—in which
tea, coffee, cocoa, milk, corfectlcnery, pastry, &o
are dispensed-is conduct d in Gipps-street (ad
joinlrg the Prince of Wales), and the elegant
lavatory attached has proved a treat convenience
to the fair sex. In addition to there, Mr L’rk ? n
carries on a Itrge wheksa'e and retail produce
store la Gipps-street, near Gerrge-stteet, also a
br-meh sti re in the Da licghurst-road, adjoining
Willi,m-‘t e t, and in these enterprises, as in a I
other, vh ch he has undertaker, hia energy and
perseverance have scored a striking success.
Coolalta Vineyard, Hunter River, New
South Wales. Some 20 years ago Mr.
John A Wilkinson, nowoneof the leading vignerons
of New South W ale s, laid out a little plot of fl ve acres
at Branxton —the beginning oMhi now famous
Coclaltv vineyard. The first vintage was ob-
tained in 1869. It amounted to cisk only.
To day the vineyards cover a very area, and
Ccola'.ta ot liars, in which the wine is stored until
thoroughly malur. d, are a marvel cf s:'zj and con-
venience. Iha projrietor of this great enterprise
now po-s eses one of the largest wine business in
New South Wale*, and his Bodega, the first of
these valuable instiiu ims ever known in the
colony, has proved not only a great boon to the
thirsty p a blic, but las also done a great service
in advertising the vintages of Au-tralia. The
la ge array of prizes taken by Mr. Wilkin-
son is sufficient testimony to the Quality of the
wines produced at Coolalta, and among the solid
evidences of lis triumphs maybe mentioned the
Bordeaux silver medal, ga'ned in competition
wi h the great wine-makers of France, Germany,
Portugal, and Spain In the very home of the
wine indus ry—the Continent where such wines
as Burgundy, Champagne. Hock, Claret, Port,
Slurry, and a thousand o’her precious vintages
have gained a reputation which has become his-
torical -Mv Wilkinson has successfully upheld
the credit ot ihs Australian wine industry, and,
having studied bis pro'ession for years in Ger
many, France, a~d Swiizerland, he has brought
the knowledge thus acquired to bear on the fertile
vineyards of the new continent. The rapid
expansion of his business bar led Mr. Wilkin-
son to open numerous Bodegas at which his
splendid wine can be purchased either by the
bottle or the glass at moderate prices. Among
these establishment may be mentioned the fol-
lowing:—3s4| Qeorge-street, Sydney, 28 Hamilton-

“ To induce people
“ to give them one trial, which so proves their
value that they will never use anything else.”
The Eembdy bo favorably noticed in all the papers,
Kligioua and secular, is
" Having a large sale, and supplanting all other medicine.
« There is no denying the virtues of the Hop plants, and the
proprietors of Dr. SouKs American Hop Bitters have shown
great ahrewdir ss and ability

Did She Die?
“ No!
“ She Unger, d and suffered along, pining away

“ The doctors doing her no good;
“And at last was cured by this Dr. Soule’s
American Hop Bitters the papers say so much
about.”
“ Indeed I Indeed 1”
“ How thankful we should be for that medi-

A Daughter’s Mise y.
«■ Eleven years our daughter suffered on a bed
of misery . ~
“ From a complication of Kidney, liver,
rheumatic trouble and Nervous debility,
“ Under the care of the best Physicians,
“ Who gave her disease various names,
“ But no relief,
“ And now she is restored to us in good health
by as gin pie a remedy as Ur. Soule’s American
Hop Bitters, teat we had shunned for years
before using it.”— The Parents.
Father is Getting Well.
“ My daughter says:
“ How much better father is since he used
Dr. Soule’s American Hop Bitters.”
‘ He is getting well after hia long suffering
from a disease declared incurable.”
“ And we are so glad that he used your Bittors.
—A Lady of N. Y.
“ Cocky ” Burns, the N.S.W. Treasurer,
says there would have been a large balance to the
credit of Government had they not exceeded
their est’mates of expenditure. “ Cooky’s ” middle
name is Fitzgerald.
The story goes that when Canovas, the
Spanish statesman, was, the other day, asked to
accept a dukedom, he answered ocntemptucus’y:
“ A fig for your dukes I I have made and unmade
plenty of them. I don’t care to he one myself.”
Some time ago a case came on for hearing
in the Walgett (N S.W.) Police Court. A solici-
tor was retained on each side. The defendant’s
attorney, having a “ bad case,” subpor sod the
opposing attorney to give evidence. When the
bench ordered ‘ all witnesses in this case” to leave
the court, &o , the legal witness had to go with
the others. But, not to be outdone, he went round
to the C.P.S. and issued a subpoena for his legal
adversary, who reluctantly quit' e 1 tt e court andhis
case. The matter bcirg left to the B nch, aver-
given for the and fandant in one act.

is—that they Oi a get £1 per monlh, out of wnich they can
save £3. They earn Acre from 3d. to Is SX .ptrday, out rf
which they find themselves, as they live on very little else
but rice. The talk amorgst them is ill Sydney, so N.S W.
will soon be inundated v.ith them, and as the Australian
people have to legislate to stop the Chinamen from s vann-
ing to Australia, I think it nothing t ut fair to let the white
workman know something cf the character cf these C dies
who are on the swarm to Australia jutt now. These men
come fr on India to F,ji under engagem.-nt to wo-k cn plan-
tations for five years and t) stay ia the con try another five
years after their time his expired, but by some arrangement
with the Government they can leave sooner. Toe y are a»ful

The ways of Providence are past finding
out, and the t-acka of eld Bill Wisdom, cf Kim-
berley, are equally inscrutab’e. When ihe rush
commenced to the rew Acid, Bill was ore of those
who followed the stony road to the intern r, and
along with him were two wild-eyed new chum-,
who marched in light check pants and astonish-
ment at the si range sights of the da-k Continent.
The open-mouthed bewilderment of this outlandish
pair amm ed Bill, and his strong tobacco and
tremendous oaths, also his fathomless knowledge
df the ways of the Iced kangaroo, Ailed them
with a sense of awe. One hot day, the trio
pitched thf ir camp beside a new-made grave on a
branch of the Bow River, and when they had
filled up whh a considerable chunk ot the last-
killed wallaby, and Bill had picked his teeih and
blasphemed numerously and lit a pipe that smelt
like the burning Cities cf the Plain, they all
strolled over to lack at the last resting-plate of
the deceased. There was a head-hoard above it
made from the end of a gin-case, and an inscrip-
tion set forth that the dust below was “ sacred to
the memory cf John Kerr, aged 22. died of rheu-
matiz, rest in peace.” The new-chums shed a tear
over the defunct pioneer, andspoke in whispers of
his untimely fate, while Bill fell heavily over the
tombstone and rose cursing, end lay down to smoke
another pipe. When he had mastered his emo-
tion ard swallowed enough nicotine to poison a
horse, he delivered himself thus: ‘Lookey’ere,
I knowed that ’ere Jack Kerr. I knowed the
galoot a dashed long time, and I’m going to dig
btm up and ’ave a look at him.” The new chums
were horrified. One of tt em tried to exorcise
Bill as if be had been an evil spirit as he dug
frenzledly at the grave, and the other commenced
reciting tbe burial service, with scraps of the mar-
riage and baptismal services interspersed, and a
few remarks suitable lor the vi ication of the sick,
also prayers for rain, and the petition for the
Royal family put in here and there when every-
thing else failed him. But old Bill solemnly
delved away, and when at list he struck the
coffin they formally gave him their curse and re-
tired to a distance. Filled with silent horror they
watched the profane William nearly breaking his
back as he haultd tut a long deal box, and when
ne shivered it open with his pick they asked why
the heavens didn’t fall and crush this loathsome
body-snatcher. Then a wild whoop split the sul-
try atmosphere, Bill’s old felt hat went 20
feet in the air, and the owner turned three
somersaults and a back-spring, and hauled
out a bottle of Dublin stout. “ It’s beer 1”
he shouted; “ facred to the memory of beer!
Half a ton of gory likker 1 Balm ia Gilead ain’t
a blessed circumstance to ths! Corn in Ejip
aint nowhere I Whoo op I Come in, ye soft-
headed, prajin’ galoots, an' have a drink !” An
hour later Bill was spread on the desert sands,
clutching a bottle, bat unconscious. Twenty
more diggers came along during the day, and they
also became unconscious, and the two new-chums
did their first drunk—and an awful drunk it was.
After that, Bill religiously disinterred every
buried object he came across, and many a decay-
ing dog and spectral horse he lei to a sudden re
sucreoion. Bat, alas! he found no more beer.
Later on, in Hall’s Gully, he came upon a half-
Ailed shaft, and, starting to investigate for more
interred liquor, he brought to light a SwedMi
and gger with his head caved in. The German vho
had planted him there was afterwards hanged at
Perth, and Bill now holds the opinion that his
keen scent fir hidden grog is a divine “instink,”
implanted in him that he may bring the wicked to
Justice.
Editor Bulletin. Sir, —Your well-timed
and brilliant idea of celebrating the Centenary of
N.S. Wales by raking a fund to feed, it but for a
few days, the pauper-stricken thousands of Eng-
land, strikes down to the bed-rcck of human sym-
pathy, g;od sense, and sound policy, and throws
every other idea into the shade. lam ready with
my mite for the fund, and as an “ Australian ”
shall feel proud to participate in it. Those who
preach Christianity may recognise in it a means
of atonement for bygone sins of omission and com-
mission, and they might treat it as a personal and
national sacrifice that may possibly appease the
demands of justice.—Yours truly,
AN AUS-
TRALIAN.

The following letter, written for publication in
the columns of an esteemed contemporary, re-
quires no introductory comments ; but its perusal
is recommended to all fathers in all parts of the
colony who are anxious te give their sons a fair
tart in life and a feeling of independence which
is in itself alone a big handicap In their favour
Sorloogabinjy Station,
November 25, 1887.
The Editor Sorlongabinjy Watchman,
Dear Mr. Newspaper,—
This day month is going to be
Christmas day, and I’ve just come home for my
holidays, and I’m going to leave altogether next
half because father wants me to tail weaners ar d
keep the store books, and I am just going down
to the Shearer’s Arm I (that's a public house about
two miles off) where our mail b>g gets d/opped
out of Che ccaoh, and I thought I'd write to you
just to ask you to give the tip to a lot of our boys
fathers about Christmas. La c t Christmas I had a
heap cf fin at home, because I've got a whole
drafting yard full ot little brothers and sisteis
lhat believe in San‘a Claus coming along in the
night and jamming tl ings into their stockings
what they hmg up on the bed. I know who puls
the things there, but they don’t, and mother said
I was never to let on, and father said he
supposed I thought I was avfal smart, but he’d
give me a Christmas-b 'x anyhow if I’d take the
grey colt and g rover to Dawson’s place before break-
fast with a letter, and run the milker's mob into the
lower paddock as I came back, and get home before
10 o’clock so as I could look after the irons while him
and J.m was branding. And I did too, and when
Christmas came I went in with father to the town-
ship in the spring-cart and brought out all the
Santa Claus things from the store, and you d have
laughed if you’d seen them when the kids woke
up and turned all the things out of the stockings
they had hung up ; only poor little Joe, he got
sick because ha would tuck all tho paint off a
spotted white and black animal the man said was
a horse, only you never saw such a fiddle-headed,
ewe necked screw in your life. Ac d there was no
present for me that I could see, only when father
says bG’ll do a thing he always does I know, for
sometimes be says he’ll kncck seven bells out of
me, and he always dees the knocking if he don’t
get the bells ; but all the same, when I went in-
-30 breakfast there was something in paper on my
plate, and when I opened it it was a Waterbury
watch in a beautiful blue silk box ; and I was
proud, I can tell you, and I’ve worn it ever since
and everybody always asks me the time, because
they know I’ve always got it right. And after the
holidays there was only another boy had ore ID e
it, and my word didn't they go together like two
twins all the time, and so when I was leaving I
told all the other boys I’d write to you so that you
cculd tell their fathers that a Waterbuty watch
was the best t v iog they wanted for a Christmas
present, because you can keep on wind’ng it up
and you can’t hurt it, and it always keeps better
time than the schoolhouse clock, and you can
time the boys when they are racing or swimming
in the creek, and it makes any boy feel go:d to
have it; and father has taken your paper ever
since I was born, and if you put this letter in all
the boys wi 1 be able to show it to their fathers,
and some tf them will most lisely get Wa'er-
burys too, and some of them won t, ai d it will be
all the better for you, because ihe next time you
lose your mare I know where she gets to up in the
ridges at the head of the yellow water hole creek,
and 111 run her in for you, and you wc uldn’t find
her if you looked from now till next mustering.
So that’s a bargain, and I must go down the
paddock now and get my horse, or I'll be late
with the ma'l. So good bye, Mr. New spapsr,
from ycur obedient,
GEORGE BOXER.

ROW’S
Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken two
or three times a day; a wineglassful for an adult,
smaller quantity for children.
For general Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of Dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Parsons suffering from Skin Disease will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals, diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the Quantity twice a day,
THEY PURIFY THE BLOOD AND LIVER,
SEE WHAT A MEDICAL GENTLEMAN SAYS
ABOUT THEM.
Messrs. E. Rowe and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried.
Yours faithfully,
HENRY CHARLES CURTIS,
M.R.C.S. England.
Port Adelaide, October 30 1886.
Gentlemen, —I have great pleasure in recom-
mending Row’s D anellon Bitters. I have been
suffering for several years with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have Only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different
man. I can, therefore, with truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them, —
Yours,
O. R. UPJOHN, J.P.
Tamworth, August 21, 1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received by
the undersigned
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feelings of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change in
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflicted as I have
been may take advantage of them.

elegant, interesting article, and then run it mto some
advertisement, that we avoid all such cheats, and simply
call attention to the merits of Dr. Soule s .American -Hop

to give them one trial, as no one who knows their value wi
ever use anything else. Providence Advertiser.

introduction in this cc lony, and no wonder for such a per-

Chlorodyne has been considerably enhanced, and is now re-
garded as the’most efficient and valuable medicine that has
ever been Introduced into the Colony. The Profession pre-

A LOSING JOKE.
A prominent physician of Pittsburg said jokingly to a lad
patient who was complaining of her continued ill-health, ana
of his inability to cure her. “Try Dr. Soule 8 Arnenjaii Hop

from which she obtained permanent health She now laughs
