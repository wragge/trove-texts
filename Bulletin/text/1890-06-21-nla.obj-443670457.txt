A RADICAL REFORM.
“Oh, I feel so Mondayish 1” exclaims the housemother
at her breakfast table on the Monday morning - . Although
the above absurd adjective is not to be found in the dic-
tionary, yet every woman well knows its meaning when
she looks forward to the teeming, steaming, boiling, toil-
ing, temper-trying, hateful washing day. The house is
thrown out of joint, other weekly duties are, as far as
possible, set aside, the-children kept out of the way, a cold
dinner for the family, and a warm reception for anyone
Who intrudes to waste time and to prolong the agony.
Happy, indeed, is the home where “washing day” is a
thing of the past. Every busy, hard-pressed mother
knows the wretchedness and gloom which the present
washing day brings down upon the household. In the
early morning all is prepared for the all important washer-
woman, timed to arrive for an early breakfast, and then
io attack the week or fortnight's batch of soiled linen.
The good-natured husband readily excuses a hastily-pre-
pared breakfast, for he hopes it may betoken the speedy
ending of the dreadful day. The children are packed oif
to school, and then begins in earnest the strife between
the housewife, anxious to get ! everythiug finished in good
time, and the professional laundress, equally anxious to
make the work last over two days. With the greatest
impartiality the laundress divides her attention between
the discussion of light refreshments and the very latest
gossip, the intervals of time being filled up with a gentle
application to her special functions
- Very many of our valued customers to whom wo have
supplied labor-saving appliances in the past, do their own
washing. In every family, in our climate, frequent
changes of underclothing are necessary. Then there are
tlie house linen, the cotton dresses, white coals, and
outer garments ; and all this is heaped up for the poor
house-mother to cleanse, perhaps with the assistance of a
daughter, if there is one old enough. It is not that the
nusband, who also works hard, is unkind. Expenses are
many, economy is imperative, days, of depression and of
trouble must be provided against. So the washing is to
be done, and the wife must do it; and after the imperfect
rest of a sultry night, as she gets ready the breakfast Upon
a hot Monday morning, she feels for a while that her lot
is cheerless, that the apportionment of toil is beyond her
share and beyond her strength ; that somehow a change
should be made. No wonder that fair young girls, after a
few years of married life, become woru-lookmg, and that
they age faster than they ought. The husband is willing
enough to cherish the good wife’s comeliness, and to make
her lot easy, but how ? She does not complain, only says
she feels always “ tired ”
Now, as purveyors of household implements, we nave
long seen our opportunity to enlarge our business by
introducing a thoroughly efficient Washing and Mangling
Machine. Both these services must be combined in the
one article. This we have most perfectly and assuredly
accomplished. The demon of the washing day is not
scotched but killed
We resolved to introduce nothing until absolutely certain
by observation, experiment, and test, that the implement
would be a success. There are hosts of Washing Machines.
The vast majority are childish fads, are injurious, or are
useless. We say and we prove that the Beale Patent
Washer will save in labour of washing in proportion as our
Sewing Machines do in sewing. And in a higher degree,
fer the washing by hands is so much the more laborious.
The Beale Patent Washer may be described as follows :
The vertical tub is very carefully made, with fluted sides.
It is stationary, only the water and the clothes being
agitated by an accurately shaped “dolly,” which is worked
by a fly-wheel. The clothes arc simply dropped in, no
arrangement or packing being wanted. The special
reversing gear moves this dolly swiftly backwards and for-
wards, and a very small expenditure of strength suffices
to lash the water' into a mass of foaming suds. In the
process the clothes are floated to and fro, up and down ;
currents and cross-currents of water are formed, which
meet, and are forced through and through the fabric,
carrying away every particle of dirt and stain. The linen,
being merely suspended in the water, is not rubbed and
lerubbed as in hand-washing. Neither , has anything to
submit to the hand-wringing process, which insensibly
rips, tears, and wears the clothes. Thus the most delicate
fabrics cannot be torn by our system of washing. Every-
one has noticed that their clothes seem to ho as much
worn by washing as by use. This is caused by the fierce
rubbing they get upon washing hoards, or by the hands.
With the Beale Patent Washing Machines this friction is
done away with. Therefore, the clothes will last far longer
than by hand-washing, however careful. When the wash-
ing is done, the tub should he wiped out, so that it be
always sweet and clean. There is no false bottom, and
nothing to accumulate greasy sediments.
When you buy a Machine of any kind,
have a good one.

The extraordinary reputation of Rowland’s Macassar
Oil, Kalydor and Odonto, induces some shopkeepers to
offer spurious imitations under the lure of being cheap,
the principle on which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge Of A. Rowland & Bone, of 20,
Hatton Garden, London, and therefore it is highly
necessary to buy noMacassar Oil. Kalydor or Odonto

AYER’S HAIR VIGOR is unrivaled for
the restoration of faded and gray hair to its
original color and freshness, and for keeping
the scalp clean and healthy. The most popular
and elegant toilet preparation in the world, all
who use it, pronounce it, also, the best hair-
grower. "When the capillary glands become en-
feebled by disease, age, or neglect, this dressing
imparts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its original
Fullness and Beauty.
Ladies find that this preparation imparts to the
hair a silken pliancy and a delicate and lasting
fragrance. Gentlemen use it to prevent bald-
ness, to restore faded and gray hair to its former
color and abundance, and to relieve the scalp of
troublesome humors and dandruff. A proof of
the superiority of this preparation over all
others of the kind is the constantly-increasing
demand for it in all civilized countries.

WHO IS
WEAK
o
Nervous & Debilitated#
Who in Ins youth has trifled away his vigour of body,
mind, and manhood, should consult PROFESSOR
CARL STINEWAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is
still treating with the greatest skill and success all
Private, Nervous and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINE WAY’S success, which has
become so,firmly established throughout Australasia,
is base'd upon the facts : —ist. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines used are
exactly adapted to suit the case, and are compounded
from the purest, freshest, and refined ingredients,
thus .promptly producing results without overdosing
or-inyury’.
_ I seek cases where all else has failed.
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, etc.,
cam recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in person or by letter, which is
free), Professor STINE WAY. who has re-
stored thousands of sufferers to vigorous man-
hood after all other treatment had failed. It
makes no difference what you, have taken, or
who has failed to cure you. Cases that I accept
for treatment are quickly and permanently
cured.
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS,
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the power of will and action ?
Are you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of
fainting; fullness of blood in the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful with your mind continually dwelling on
the subject? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits? Arc you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation
of the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms ? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single con-
sultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed on
the way to health, strength, and vigour ?
y All correspondence held sacred. A speedy
and perfect life cure is guaranteed in all cases
I undertake, where doubt exists the sufferer is
frankly informed.

treatment without delay can, by forwarding a
full description of their case and £i, receive
by return of post the medicines required.

READ THIS
Western Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism. —Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of tine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of thedistrict are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.
“ History repeats itself,” and as surely as Sydney and
Melbourne'have made lightning-like progress, so will

SATURDAY, JUNE 21, 1890.
Australia and the Pacific.
Uncomfortable relations have been occa-
sioned between Great Britain and France, in
consequence of apparently insoluble difficul-
ties between the French fishermen on the
Newfoundland hanks and Her Majesty’s
subjects in Newfoundland. The two Powers
are equally anxious to come to an accommo-
dation and both are in a difficulty. With re-
gard to the French, a large marine enterprise,
valuable not only in a commercial sense,
but as a nautical nursery for hardv
mariners, is concerned. The rights of the
Frenchare incompatible with thedesiresof the
Newfoundlanders. The latter desire, in fact,
a monopoly of the fishing-banks to which their
province is the nearest territory. The French,
by long-standing treaty, have a title not
merely to share in these fisheries, but ac-
tually to invade, in a pacific sense, the ad-
jacent shores, forage for bait, and cure their
fish. They stretch their treaty-rights pretty
fully. On the other hand, the Newfound-
landers threaten, if the British Government
do not practically break the treaty with
France and drive their fishermen from those
coasts, to hoist the stars and stripes and
solicit admission into the United States Con-
federation. This is scarcely a serious atti-
tude. for the t nited States' diplomatists are
little likely to hanker after a bleak territory
in a detached and assailable position, with a
big quarrel with a couple of the greatest
Powers of Europe for sole dowry.
* * *
A member of the House of Commons, Sir
Georoe Campbell, who has of late evinced
considerable, although misguided, activity in
connection with colonial affairs, has suggested
that the difficulty may be accommodated by
the French ceding all their treaty-rights in
the Newfoundland fisheries, and the British
in recognition withdrawing their objections
to the appropriation of the New Hebrides by
the French. This proposition has set wag-
ging the jaws of every Chauvinistic donkey
in Australia. - The Sydney Daily Telegraph
breaks out into frantic reclamations on the
subject. It declares that under no conceiv-
able circumstances would these colonies
quietly submit to any arrangement Great
Britain might make to allow the New
Hebrides to [ 'ass into foreign possession.
What the alternative to quietly submitting
might be. is not made very plain. There is
a reference indeed to a stimulation of the
separation movement. But the degree in
which separation from Great Britain would
assist Australia in securing the exclusion of
foreign powers from the Pacific is not eluci-
dated. This is a somewhat important omis-
sion, we conceive, and illustrates the incon-
sequence of the ideas which prevail among
the Australian Chauvinists.
* * •
( There are three positions to be considered.
The first is that by a clamour worked up
in Australia, the Imperial Government is
constrained to alienate the loyalty of the
Newfoundlanders, and risk a quarrel with
the United States, rather than conciliate the
Newfoundlanders, avoid all chance of United
States intrigue with the North American
Colonies—an intrigue which might easily be
made to comprehend the provinces of Canada
peopled by the descendants of the original
French settlers—and get rid of two subjects
of uneasy relations with the French nation.
The second is that the British Government,
refusing to yield to an agitation worked up
in Australia, made the arrangement suggested
by Sir George Campbell, with the result
that Australia, after bitter grumbling, sub-
mitted. The third is that in consequence of
Great Britain taking the last-mentioned
course, Australia determined upon separa-
tion. In the first case, the Imperial authori-
ties having made serious sacrifices, assumed
heavy responsibilities, and hazarded fearful
risks in compliance with Australian demands*
would assuredly have established a claim
upon Australia for corresponding sacrifices
wherever they may be necessary to the wel-
fare of the empire. Should France or the
United States, even although apparently
giving way on this particular point*
nurse a rancorous resentment and find a Vent
for it on some quite different subject, and
with regard possibly to some other region of
the earth, Great Britain would be justified
in representing to Australia : “ This is your
doing ; you must bear your full share of this
trouble.” Under such circumstances the
colonies could not justly complain were the
Australian Squadron withdrawn to operate
on the coast of Madagascar, against the
French, or were British recruiting parties to
parade through Australian towns, enlisting
men for regiments to join the Royal troops
at Guiana or the West Indies. In the
second case Australia would have gained
nothing save a grudge against the mother
country. In the third case, numerous con-
siderations complicate the problem. To
begin with, Great Britain might refuse to
permit Australia to secede from the nation.
If so, all that the Chauvinists would have
accomplished would be the alternatives of a
sullen subjection, or a war of independence
with Great Britain. Let ns Suppose that
such a war resulted in the defeat of the
mother country and the achievement of
Australian independence. How much nearer,
m that event, would we be to the accom*
plishment of the object originally sought,
namely, the exclusion of all foreign
powers from the islands of the Pacific ?
It !s an axiom in historical Science that a
nation emerging from a successful war is
only a little less exhausted than a nation
emerging from an unsuccessful one. Aus-
tralia, drawing a long breath after so des-
perate a struggle as that with Great Britain,
would be in a pretty condition to commence
the job of despatching expeditions to drive
the French from New Caledonia, the Ger-
mans from New-Guinea, the Solomons, New
Britain, and New Ireland. Fach of these
places is nearer to some portion of the coast
of Australia than are (lie New Hebrides I
Pursuing the matter to its ridiculous ex-
tremity, once the Germans (and the British)
were driven out of New Guinea, ami theiV
portion of that island made part of the Aus-
tralian territory, the same ride of policy
which prompted the whole series of events
would require an immediate attack upon the
Dutch, whose part of the Island would then
actually touch Australian possessions all
along a frontier of a thousand miles or so a
frontier constituted by an imaginary line
drawn on a map.
# ' * *
Next, supposing the Dutch %o 'share the
unhappy fete of Great Britain, Germany,
and I ranee, and to be driven headlong out
of their possessions by the overwhelming
might of Austmlian armies ami thfc
task would he merely commenced. Australia
would, by series of feats unpaialleled in the
history of successful war fete, have huV>ed
three great nations, or suc-
cessively, out of those possessions which lay
so close to Australia as to ekeite jealousy or
apprehension. New Guinea would be ours ;
New r Caledonia, the New r Hebrides, the
Solomons, New Britain, New' Ireland would
be subject to the flag of the Southern Cross.
Surely that should content us. But no! the
miserable policy of keeping all " foreigners ”
at a distance from Australian territory would
like the villain in the melodramas—still
pursue us. By these extensions of our
possessions we should, instead of removing
the evil which stmig us into an activity so
remarkable, have simply aggravated it. We
could never feel secure in the New Hebrides
while Great Britain held Fiji, the distance
between the tw r o island groups being less
than half that which separates the New
Hebrides from the Australian continent.
Nor could our nervous minds be at ease with
regard to our New Guinea territory while
the Moluccas were in foreign hands.
* # #
In tine, the whole theory of the cranks
who insist on every island or group in the
Pacific which lies within a week’s steaming
of Australia being kept out of the hands of
foreigners, leads to a ludicrous and gro-
tesque i ’'duetto ad absnrdum. Once admit its
validity and there is no escape from the con-
clusion that Australian liberties will never be
safe until the entire globe has been brought
into subjection in the interests of Austra-
lians. lo sally outside the natural boun-
daiies of the continent is not the way to keep
possible foes at a distance. On the contrary,
it is the certain plan to turn friends into
foes and to thrust ourselves within teach of
these blows while weaKVJurig ourselves by
elongation. • x

The true policy of Young Austin lift is the
policy of concentration ; of abstention fpom
meddling with territories beyond her own
obvious geographical limits. It is surprising
that With so recent, so striking, and so suc-
cessful an example as that which the United
States have furnished in this identical par-
ticular, there can be. found any persons so
crass as to counsel ft policy of external
aggression for Australia. What is advocated
is in effect as though the early American
statesmen had counselled their people to
insist upon the evacuation of the West India
Islands by all the European powers which
owned them. To-day, thanks to the wisdom
which has taught the Republic to refrain
from intermeddling with affairs exterior to
its own territory, the United States has
grown into a power which is potent to absorb
the West Indies at any time it Play think
the game worth the candle. Ret Australians
take heed to the lesSOriS Of history, and turn
the ear of derision to those hysterical coun-
sellors who would fain prompt them to ft
display of imbecility.
A New Source of Revenue.
The frantic rush for shares in that recently-
collapsed institution, the Commercial Bfthk Lot-
tery, proves that Australia has hot befell made

We are Well aware that a shriek of anger and
derision from the Church at large will greet these
proposals, but while the Church continues to live
so largely and directly on lotteries and raffles and
other sinful devices, not to mention the gifts of
the gamblers who are among its chief sup-
porters, it has little reason to complain if the State
phooses lb do the same. Moreover, the Church
has devised nothing since the days of the Crusades
which promised in the least degree to supply that
craving for excitement which is rooted in the
human soul, and that old diversion proved so un-
satisfactory and unprofitable that it has long since
Ceased to be regarded as ft rational amusement.
The WOrld has tacitly resolved that a life of
hftmble, plain respectability is too maddening in
its colourless monotony to be endured, and it is
always suffering from a desire to go out and do
something to prevent the moss growing on its
weary, torpid soul. It Used to sally forth and kill
somebody in times Of mental exhaustion, but this
light entertainment has lost inUch Of its popularity,
and is rioW, Regarded ft's a business instead
Of ift PebVeation. It grew excited over vvild-
heast fights, and public floggings and hangings,
and refreshed itself by watching men pound each
other to death, but all these things have fallen off
more or less, It has been looking for and finding
some form of diversion—generally a sinful one—
ever since it Was first furnished with intelligence,
but gambling has outlasted all the rest. Respec-
tability is ft solemn, portentous thing, and as it
has consistently opposed itself to amusement the
bulk of humanity refuses to be respectable. It
wants to be amused, and a tall, black hat and a
'funeral are not thrilling enough for the purpose.
And, therefore, despite the protests ceaselessly
issued by the Spectre bf Respectability, the larger
paid Of the human race keeps on gambling as the
readiest means of escape from its own weariness,
fthd as the evil seems to defy all remedy, We
Suggest, that -it should be made, if possible, a
profitable and agreeable sin, instead of being a
profane and riotous offence and a dead loss as well.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Bankers Repentance.
o


Holy Roman ruffianism, but as nobody seems to
want to besiege Londonderry any more, the nar-
rative might as well be laid away in company with
the Siege of Nicopolis and the other fluff and
debris of history; and besides, the besiegers and
besieged are all"dead together, and the Orangeman
of to-day has no more connection with that episode
than he has with the capture of Bagdad. The horrors
of ’9B will, of course, be exposed once more to the
public gaze, and if anybody can be found living at
the present day who had anything to do with the
horrors of ’9B, we would suggest that the Unionist
party should promptly hang that person, and then
change the subject, and go on to talk of something
fresh. The dead are an old, used-rrp topic ; and,
moreover, man is short and history is very long,
and there is barely time enough to look after the
living. And, so far as the living is concerned,
the case is this : The world has finally recognised
that one man cannot justly belong to another man,
and it is equally logical to assume that one nation
cannot lawfully belong to another. The right of
every man to own himself implies the right of a
nation to do the same. As the Irish representa-
tives in the Imperial Parliament are invariably
voted down by the numerical superiority of the
English members, and Ireland, in consequence, is
governed by England, the Irish nation does not
own itself—it is at present foreign property.
Whether Ireland has benefited by English rule
has nothing to do with the case ; whether it would
go to the devil under Irish rule is a purely ex-
traneous question. The agnostic or the idolater
may be going headlong to perdition, but public
opinion has reluctantly recognised the fact that if
he insists on it he must be allowed to go, and that
the Christian has no right to put him in gaol or use
other violent means to save his soul if he doesn’t
want it saved. The inalienable right of every
citizen to go to hell if he is really howling
for a place there, is admitted by the code
of every European nation; and even if Mr.
Abigail’s Orange delegation should prove in every
town and village of Australia, from Sydney to
Perth, and from Adelaide to the remotest regions
beyond the alligator-line, that Ireland —if allowed
to run her own Government without the benefi-
cent interference of England—is going to Gehenna
straight, we can only say briefly that it is her
blessed privilege to go if she feels that way.
What the delegation really wants to prove is, that
it is right and lawful for one man to own another
man without his consent, and for one aggregation
of men to own another when the second lot want
to own themselves; and if the Orange representa-
tives can’t demonstrate this fact then they are
fooling round for no visible purpose. And as it is
not worth anybody’s while to come 16,000 miles
merely to offer a few weary platitudes about some-
body who isn’t alive any longer, we trust that
delegation will either come armed with a few
fresh observations or else will think better of it
and stay at home.
That Laughter in Court.
An incident at which the cynical outside world
sniggered bitterly, while the allegorical figure of
Justice probably blushed, marked the conclusion of
Counsel Purves’ indictment of the Premier Perma-
nent Building Society crowd. Rather, it should be
said that the outside world —which is of necessity
excluded from ‘Melbourne City Court just now-
sniggered as aforesaid when it got the Herald’s
report. After having dealt for two whole days
with a series of alleged financial juggles, pasting
together of ledger leaves, replacements of cash
abstractions with an official’s 1.0.U.’s and
business arrangements of a peculiarly “ fishy ”-
looking character—after having, in fact, opened
what can fairly be described as a strong prima-
facie case against some of the influential
defendants, Purves ventured to suggest that he
would at least succeed in obtaining their committal
to a higher court. Not a very extravagant pro-
position, as police-court cases go, nor one which is
usually received with other than calm indifference
by counsel for the accused party. For some
reason, however, the mere mention of a prima facie
case in connection with an ex-member of Parlia-
ment, two ex-Cabinet Ministers still in the House,
a “blood-relation” of an almighty paper, and a son
of a leading politician, threw their legal representa-
tives into a mild state of merriment. But when
Purves went on to hint at various degrees of
criminality calling for various degrees of punish-
ment —Great Justice! how his learned friends
roared, to bo sure. Even the defendants smiled
at that. Punishment! It was too droll. Punish-
ment for these gentlemen, some of whom were not,
at that time, particular about being present or
absent from the court where they were nominal
prisoners !
The counsel laughed with the lawyers,
Each lawyer grinned at a beak—
What, punish these here top-sawyers !
Well, haven’t some chaps got cheek !
Egad, it was quite too funny,
A doosidly comical stroke.
(Investors who’ve lost their money—
They haven’t yet seen the joke.)
Time will show whether this significant hilarity
was inspired by secret knowledge or by shrewd
suspicion merely. Perhaps, indeed, it was the
spontaneous outcome of a simple faith which the
riotous barristers have orr the complete innocence
of their clients severally and collectively. Any-
way, such a combined legal effort to laugh down a
serious charge was disgraceful, and will set decent
people speculating on the possible existence of a
fraudulent conspiracy of influence outside Mel-
bourne City Court, a conspiracy for further estab-
lishing the fact that there may be one law for the
Rich and another for the Poor.

Awake on His Beat.
There were several reasons why, during the course
of the recent strike of dock-labourers in London,
the strikers were not vigorously smashed and per-
secuted. One was, no doubt, because there had
been roused a certain degree of shocked feeling
among the Philistine classes, in consequence of
having the appalling condition of those workers
forced upon their attention. Rank and Wealth
were somewhat divided on this particular subject.
The great Landed Interest which includes the
Peerage, did not feel itself specially concerned
even though the dock-labourers should wrench an
extra penny per hour from the griping hands of
commercial Capital, It was not unfashionable—
not mnuvais ton— to sympathise in a qualified sort
of way with tire strikers. The situation was con-
siderably different fromthat of the Trafalgar Square
sympathy-with-lreland meetings. In that instance
there was complete solidarity among the classes,
with the full weight of the’Government at their
backs. Consequently the police were turned loose
upon the people, and broke brave John Burns’
head amidst universal applause and considerable
enthusiasm. The vigour of the metropolitan
Police on that occasion was highly lauded by the
Classes and their newspaper organs. Cultured
peers and lusty squires rubbed their hands and
chuckled to thj.uk Irow fully tire Force could be
depended upoTto smash any assemblage of the
People who dared to collect in protest against any
wrong, however grievous, and rrnder any circum-
stances, however legal. They reckoned, no doubt,
that on that occasiou their hounds, the Police, were
“ blooded,” and thenceforth could _ always be
reckoned upon to worry those vermin, the mob.
Subsequent events, however, indicate that the real
result of that collision between the policemen and
the People has been to set the blue-coated People
reflecting with respect to tbeir actual relation to
the People in fustian. When the dock-labourers
assembled in thousands, another reason, probably
more potent than the one we first mentioned, why
they were not charged by the Police and clubbed
till they dispersed, was that “ the Police could not
be depended upon.” Now comes the signifi-
cant intelligence that the Policemen them-
selves are forming a Union. The next pro-
bable step will be that the Policeman’s
Union has affiliated with the British Trades-
Union. The Postmen, too, we are rejoiced to
observe, are in motion with a similar tendency, so
that when next a body of special constables to club
the mob is called for, it seems unlikely that Saint
Martin’s le Grand will furnish its usual contingent.
In short, the official people in the civil ranks have
begun to appreciate the fact that the mob consists
simply of their own class out of uniform. The
next body of the British people to learn a lesson
so contagious will assuredly be the soldiery, and
once these shall have thoroughly appreciated the
truth, the process of crushing social agitation with
batons, and smashing it with bullets, bayonets,
sabres and grape-shot will be unavailable to the
oligarchs of Great Britain. After that —the
Deluge.
Mr. Kidd, M.L.A., is understood to complain
that the country papers as a rule, report the put-
pourings of himself and his fellow members in a
way that makes them utterly incapable of recogni-
tion. We cordially endorse the statement, and
only object to it as being too weak. The Parlia-
mentary reports of the country press are demora-
lising and contrary to the noblest instincts of
humanity, arrd also they come as near to lying as
any printed matter well can. Listen to this for
instance :
Mr. Gamp, in an eloquent speech, denounced the mea-
sure as unstatesmarilike and deficient in scope. He then
briefly sketched the outlines of a comprehensive scheme
which he proposed to substitute for the inefficient pro-
posals of the Ministry. His attack was probably the most
damaging the Cabinet has met with this session, and it
will not soon recover from the blow.
Compare the meagre, bald, naked wretchedness of
this colorless picture with the burning eloquence
of the orator as it ought to appear in the country
“ horgan,” and see what these few lines of skimpy
drivel amount to by comparison :
Mr. Gamp : “Mr. Speaker, the Bill now afore the ’Ouse
is hall rot an’ oughter be throwed through the winder. It
haint no good to nobody. (A voice : ‘ Rats ! ’) The per-
son as said rats is a horphan blaokbeetle dyin’ in a soap-
box. Why didn’t somebody throw him away when he
was young ? As I was sayin’ the Bill ain’t no good. The
conshtitooency I reppersent wants to be purvided with a
noo post-hoffis, an’ the Guv’ment ain’t dredged the creek,
and in consekens of this neglect trade is a failin’ hoff.
(Derisive cheers.) The Iron, member that interrupted
me jest now was found on a dsorstep. (Cries of ‘ Come
outside.’) I won’t. You’re a broken-down bandicoot.
(A voice, “ You’re a liar.”) I ain’t! Your another ! So’s
yer mother ! I’ll fight yer for tuppence. The institoo-
shuns of this country her gone to the dogs an’ I’m pre-
pared to camp here till I take root afore this ’ere Bill gets
through. There oughter he a loan floated for £10,000,000
an’ railways made everywhere. I ain’t going to be choked
hoff. I moves as a hamendment that the Gov’ment be
called upon to make lines all hover the country an’ that
taxation be abolished right hoff. (Loud applause.) An’
I wants tfiis ’ere done hinstantly.”
—
In conversation with a Pall Mall Gazette
interviewer, Francis Abigail has let his tongue
wag freely on “the sentimental attachment of
Australia to the mother country. ” After stating
that “ if a poll of the Australian people could be
taken on the subject to-morrow, there would be an
overwhelming majority in favor of maintaining our
allegiance to the mother land,” he goes on to allege
that at the notorious “Queen’s Fund” (Jubilee)
meeting at Sydney Exhibition building—“not a
ticket-meeting, mind you, the hall was cram-
med ; 20,000 people were present; and when some
disaffected fellow shouted out a word of abuse at
the mention of the-Queen, he was pitched out of the
window , and the meeting was enthusiastic in its
loyalty. That is a type of the feeling of Sydney.”
Splendid lie! Everyone in Sydney knows that
the spaces round the platform were filled by the
back-door reception of Orangemen, who helped to
pack the great hall ere the general public were
admitted, that a number of prize-fighters and
ball-kickers were specially engaged, that sailors
from the men-of-war in harbour attended in the
Imperial interest, that the Permanent Force was
in attendance with loaded guns to stifle, even by
bloodshed, all noisy demonstrations of disloyalty,
and that the Governor was escorted to the hall by a
pack of professional bruisers. What happened ?
Why, in spite of the packing of the meeting, in
spite of all the previous “ chucking-out” of
openly declared Republicans by Orangemen,
and boxing and kicking bullies, yet when
the matter was put to the vote there was no
visible preponderance on the side of “royalty”;
the votes of those surrounding the platform went
for Imperialism, while the hands of those separated
from it by a drilled body of privately-admitted
person’s went up like a forest for Republicanism
and Independence. Furthermore, incensed by ill-
usage, by the “ Kentish fire ” of Orangemen, by
being refused the right to move amendments and
of speech through their representatives, the
penned-off Australian Nationalists then made a
rush for the platform and, but for the opportune
appearance of Lady Carington, some damage
would have been done to ultra-loyalists and the
professional bullies, their hired assistants. In a
squarely-conducted and truly public mass meeting
Imperialism would be licked in Sydney by three
votes to two. And well do the Royalists know it.
Dear Bulletin, —As an axiom of sound com-
mercial morality, there is more risk than reve-
nue to be derived from treating the vagaries
of the cable liar on the basis of abstract truth ;
but if he be not actually on the solid rock
in his statement that the police of London
have formed themselves into a union, he is
only trading on the future with a fair margin of
discount. And when that union is formed and
takes its place among the Trade and Labour
organisations of the old world, another link that
binds the workers to the festering rottenness of
Monarchy will be suddenly snapped. Despite their
uniforms, their discipline, their allegiance to
the tyranny imposed by system and upheld by
custom, the sympathies of the police were with
their suffering fellow men, the dock labourers,
throughout the recent strike. The authorities
knew that and provided for emergencies by con-
stant watchfulness, and by scattered detachments
of troops throughout the metropolis, armed and
ready for the contingency which they had but too
good reasons for dreading. There was a strong
bond of human sympathy between the police and
the men on strike, each side knew it and both sides
were bound by it. The police were the anti-friction
medium between the Purple and the People, the
buffer between the civil and the nrilitary elements
of strife. Probably before another stage is reached
in the great social upheaval which is looming closer
and more distinctly day by day, the medium will
have been absorbed into the ranks of unionism,
the buffer have been withdrawn and enveloped in
the rapidly extending halo of righteous feeling for
the starving pauper and the gaunt victims of greed
and oppression. And then? Well, before the
final bitter lesson has been learnt which will drive
Tommy Atkins off on the same track, we shall
perhaps hear that a detachment of the household
troops has been ordered to an East End slum
rrnder the command of some pompous idiot —whose
father was first a pimp and then a lord with a
capital L —a youth of simian aspect and imperfect
speech, whose sole duty, after the Riot Act has
been read, will consist in giving the orders to
“ Make weady,” “Pwesent,” “Ah, fiah ! doncher-
know.” That “ Eiah!” will sound the knell of the
monarchy. —W.

A few months ago Melbourne Age dropped upon
the little Herald for reproducing the former’s
cablegrams as news from Our Own (Herald)
Correspondent. Now the Herald is taking a
legitimate revenge by furnishing unpleasantly full
reports of the Premier Building Association case,
calling particular attention to the Gourlay-Syme
relationship—which we do not say has anything to
do with the case—and generally doing its level best
to counteract the Age’s sustained efforts to throw
ridicule upon the case for the prosecution. Those
who can read between the lines of daily journalism
find much to interest them in the attitudes that
the various Melbourne organs are assuming with
regard to this cause celebre. The Herald points
out how the defendants begin to show symptoms
of “intense anxiety.” The Argus is evidently a
prey to conflicting emotions. On the one hand it
is most undesirable, you know, to have charges
against persons of “position,” and, on the other-
hand, it would be nice to take a rise out of the
nasty penny “largest circulation.” The Age de-
fiantly flourishes what looks like a brief for the de-
fendants in the face of the world. The Standard,
being in a roundabout way a sort of thirty-second
cousin of the Age, publishes colourless accounts
of the trial. And the Telegraph, saintly organ
of professional religion, teetotalism, and genteel
land-booming, sheds a feeble ray of dull respecta-
bility over the charges, seeming to hint that cri-
minal conduct under a tall hat is not to be thought
of. But as the public like to get the latest,
fullest, and spiciest information for after-dinner
consumption, the Herald is probably forming a
larger amount of honest opinion than all the other-
papers put together.
The smart tactics of the Victorian Opposition, in
declining to discuss Federation until there is
something tangible to talk about, have bustled
little Gillies considerably. The three weeks, at
least, he had reckoned upon getting for the com-
pletion of his Railway Bill were suddenly reduced
to as marry days, and the utter impossibility of
dealing out 1000 miles of rail at such short notice
on terms calculated to make the Government
“ right ” in dangerous quarters, caused D. Gillies,
Premier, to put in a very unquiet Sabbath after-
noon. By this time, probably, the Bill, with
all its imperfections on its wicked head, is
before a disgusted House. The land-syndicators
who find their tracts of paper-purchased country
neglected, the smaller speculators in bits of
suburban property which they thought were to
be wanted for- the new line, you know, who are
now told that “ it can’t, be considered at present,
dear boy,” arrd, in fact,' three-fourths of the
glorious army of jobbers are gnashing their old
gums this moment. It’s very hard on little Dun-
can. If the exchequer- were good for 10,000
miles of new railways he might slap ’em
down in the proper places and flood the
country with rolling-stock. But the colony
happens to be a “broker,” and the trouble of
ruling by the favour- of a crowd of hyenas, who are
likewise “ brokers,” is great indeed. If they had
all taken up a lot of Tramway Cos. shares, they
might be able to hold on for a bit longer. Now
they are desperate men, who may at any minute
stand upon the floor of the House and belch forth
appalling statements under the influence of strong
drink, while the small minority, made “right ” by
the Bill, vainly endeavour to drown the dreadful
revelations in shouts of “ Shame !”
David Gaunson, so long held up to scorn by the
Age, is at present in high favour with that “ demo-
cratic ” organ. His attack on Purves last week,
made with the apparent object of getting himself
ejected from Melbourne City Court, was graciously
received by the Age “as the certain outcome of
the appearance of Mr. Gaunson and Mr.
Purves on different sides ” —rowdy David’s
side happening to be that of the Pre-
mier B.S. defendants. “Mr. Gaunson Protests ”
was the Age heading, leading the guileless
reader to suppose that he had got something im-
portant to protest against, instead of being en-
gaged in kicking up a senseless shindy. Did any
readers, The Bulletin wonders, recall to mind the
day of yore when Gaunson’s “ protests” in Par-
liament were reckoned up as “disgraceful scenes,”
and when his statements were described as un-
worthy of notice by the newspapers which now
smile upon him? Faugh!
*
A largo number of Australian and N.Z. paper ß
are just now discussing the question whether Mr.
Joseph, proprietor of the Tam worth News, should
not have refused to give up the name of his own
contributor, Martin, now being criminally pro-
secuted for libel by Commissioner Eddy. Says a
Darling Downs journal:—
Mr. Joseph swears he had the writer’s permission, to do
so, but even supposing the permission were given with a
full knowledge of the consequences, the action is no
honour to journalism. Mr. Eddy is manifestly anxious to
get at the fountainhead of the libel, so-called, and the
anxiety is more natural than philosophical. We hold
that the onus of guilt, if guilt there be, in such oases
lies upon him who gives the libel vitality. Martin
or anyone else might devote his days and nights
to • concocting charges without anybody being the
worse or wiser unless a means were found of giving the
charges currency. Nobody controlling a newspaper is
under any obligation to publish anybody’s communica-
tion. If he does, it is of his own free will and election,
always supposing the man is worth his salt, and from that
moment he assumes the whole responsibility, and should
see it out like a man. Many a good man under such cir-
cumstances makes a grievous mistake, but the mis-
take is his own ; and many a good man makes
no mistake in equity, although a huge blunder in
law. In such cases the public should come to
his rescue. Under no circumstances should he attempt
to shift his responsibility to other shoulders, and
whoever would wring from another a reluctant consent to
assume that responsibility does not possess courage up to
the height of his position, while no epithet is too base for
him who would betray confidence by giving up the name
of a writer. The Press is pretty well educated rip to these
ethics, the iguorants not being many, but the public, we
grieve to sec, even men holding such positions as Mr.
Eddy and Judge Cooi-kr, retain an invincible desire to go
for the writer.
Which all bears on the discussion about signed
articles raised by Salomons, Q.C.
What is Cruelty ?
The Divorce Bill now being discussed by the
Legislative Council of New South Wales pro-
vides that the courts may dissolve marriage, not
only for adultery, but for habitual drunkenness,
neglect to provide, desertion, habitual cruelty,
and other causes. While much controversy has
been indulged in as to whether divorce can be
granted by the State for any cause whatever,
little attention has been paid to the clauses of the
Bill which specify the grounds on which it is pro-
posed to legalise divorce. This is a blunder on
the part of those who oppose divorce. It is plain
that the Bill will pass. Those who have the
measure in hand should see that their intentions
are clearly expressed in the various clauses, while
those who oppose it might usefully employ them-
selves in endeavouring to make the best of what is
inevitable.
# * *
There can, of course, be very little dispute as to
the interpretation which the Bill will bear, so far
as most of its clauses are concerned. Adultery
does not require an act of Parliament for its defini-
tion ; desertion is defined as being for a period of
three years or more; neglect to provide is self-
explanatory ; drunkenness is rather too common in
this community to admit of much mistake in its
recognition. Not so cruelty. There are some
forms of cruelty which no one is likely to mistake.
No jury or judge is likely to regard the trouncing
of a woman with a prop-stick as wholesome
fun, nor hauling her round by the hair
of the head as mistaken fondness. There are
other forms of playfulness which are sometimes
indulged in that may be viewed differently. There
is cruelty mental, cruelty moral, and cruelty
physical; we might perhaps add also cruelty to
the feelings. The question does not, however,
admit of being summed up in this fashion. What
is cruelty to a pretty woman might be merely a
charitable attention if applied to a plain one.
When we were in America last year a book was
issued at Washington on the subject of Divorce
and Marriage Laws. It was prepared under a
special Act of Congress, and contains much in-
teresting information. We made at the time some
extracts giving the facts which were held by some
of the State Courts to sustain the charge of cruelty.
The selections were made not because the items
were more serious than the others or more ridi-
culous, but simply because they were short and
pithy. The following are complaints made by
women for which divorces were granted
Plaintiff alleges that defendant does not wash himself,
thereby inflicting on plaintiff great mental anguish.
Defendant would not permit plaintiff to walk on the
streets with her relations ; he spoke disrespectfully of her,
calling her a “ rip.”
Plaintiff says she is subject to sick headaches, that grow
worse when she smells tobacco. Defendant uses tobacco,
and thus aggravates her headaches.
Defendant was guilty of cruelty in not providing a sup-
ply of water at his house, and in not repairing the said
house so as to make it comfortable.
Defendant would not support plaintiff, and, when re-
quested to do so, replied that he would not work his “ toe-
nails off for any woman.”
“ Defendant cut off my bangs by force.”
“My husband would never cut his toe-nails, and 1 was
scratched very severely every night, especially as he was
very restless.”
Plaintiff says defendant will not work during the week,
but on Sundays he puts on his old clothes and works hard
all day, which conduct sorely grieves plaintiff.
Another case may be instanced, wherein—
A rich girl disliking her guardian, went to the hospital
with the intention of marrying a dying man, thinking
that as a widow she would lie freer and have more control
over her estate. She married a man seemingly at the
point of death; but the man recovered, and the wife
brought suit for cruelty and fraud.
The complaints of the poor husbands were nut
quite so varied, but the following cases show that
wives were not without a taste for devilish
cruelty
Defendant violently upbraided plaintiff and said to
him : “You are no man at all ’’—thus causing him mental
suffering and anguish.
Plaintiff says : “ My wife refused to keep my clothing in
repair. She even refused to cook and never sewed on my
buttons.” A witness testified that he had seen plaintiff
with only one button on his vest. Plaintiff further
alleged that his wife would not allow him to go to fires at
night ; that if he went she would keep him awake until
three o’clock quarrelling.
Defendant struck plaintiff a violent blow with her
bustle.
Defendant has frequently evinced towards plaintiff a
hasty temper.
During the last year defendant has struck plaintiff with
pokers, flat-irons, and other hard substances.
Defendant aimed a red-hot poker at the head of plaintiff.
We once saw a noted book of Roman Catholic
theology, compiled by some learned person of lorig
ago, for the use of confessors, but we should say very
little used. This book is in Latin, and contains a
catalogue of all the sins that it was possible for man,
woman, or child to have committed at the time of
its publication. We say at the time of publication,
since, in these days of syndicates, tramways, pubhc
parks, &c., there are plenty of sins committed
which could hardly have occurred to the author.
Our suggestion is that an index be prepared, set
ting forth all the acts of cruelty which a man
can inflict on a woman, or a woman inflict
on a man who is her husband. Those act.
which the legislature think are worthy of
divorce might be distinguished by an asterisks
There are men in the Legislature who are capabe!
of drawing up such a list, so far as husbands would
be affected, and there is fair reason for supposing
their wives could compile, if not from actual ex-
perience at least from hearsay, an equally com-
plete list from a woman’s point of view. Such an
index could easily be added to as new modes of
torture unfold themselves, and as civilisation ad-
vances, acts which were not originally distin-
guished by * could be promoted to the full rank of
major offences. Henry Siebel.
The latest bore at Saltern Creek run, near
Blaokall (Q.), is 1970 ft. deep, arrd yields a 400-gallon
tankful every 50 seconds, or 609,000 gallons a day.
The temperature is very high, 160 deg.
The gallows on which the wife-killer
Barry was hanged up North the other day was
brought to Rockhampton at the time Queensland
separated from N.S.W. over thirty years ago.
Previous to that it had been in use for a long tiro*'
on the Hunter River, having been very frequently
set up in the old convict days. How carefulh
they must guard the palladium of British liberty
the gallows—in Queensland !
Question asked by Cobb, M.P., in tho
Commons :
Whether the Secretary of State is aware that in the fen
years from 1879 to 1888 inclusive, there were in England
and Wales 1766 verdicts of wilful murder found b;
coroners’ juries, 672 persons committed for trial, -if •
acquitted or found insane, 299 condemned to death, no
executed, and 146 sentences of death commuted? And
whether, looking to the disparity between the numbers'or
committals and convictions, and between tho numbers o:
capital sentences passed and carried cut, as compared
with committals, convictions, and sentences for other
crimes of violence, the Government will, in this or next,
session, introduce a measure either tor tire abolition of
capital punishment, or for otherwise amending lire law
relating to punishment for wilful murder?

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, June 18,1890.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
The first vice-regal reception of the season at Sydney on
52th inst. was attended by a large, though not exactly all-
wool, flock—the per-centage of strange, lost-looking people,
who stood about looking the picture of misery in their too
Obviously “ Sunday dresses,” being large and depressing;
tut the day was superb. Lady Carington, ably lieu-
tenanted by her lord, who is apparently gifted with a tire-
less hand-grip (I wasn’t the first arrival, by a long way,
hut the V.R. greeting “bust” a button off my Suedes),
received all the time in the red drawing-room and wore a
gown in shot-pink silk made with a plain front and water-
f ill back over a tournure, the bodice and skirt lined with
i:arrow ribbon velvet in fawn-brown; velvet sleeves in
f awn-brown only slightly ridged at the shoulder, coronet
bonnet of pink roses and velvet with shot velvet strings ;
brown silk parasol. Mayoress Burdekin wore a very hand-
some gown in true prune velvet and'Russell cord, the
hack made perfectly 7 straight over a slight indication of
fulness ; the bodice having velvet sleeves and a Zouave of
hlack braiding, small bonnet en suite ; Miss Walenn, green-
nnd-blue tartan trimmed with velvet, dark-blue hat and
feather ; Miss Irene Vanbrugh, a sombre, limpish attire in
grey tweed snowflaked, cut low in the neck and bound
about the body in a weird way with black silk, Tosca hat
in black felt and feathers, with the indispensable veil, of
course. There were few distinctly choice costumes on
view, the majority clinging to velvet sleeves and a floral
hat with great tenacity 7 . Much loud adulation was
indulged in over the oil-painting, hy a local artist, of the
Misses Alexandra, Marjorie, and Ruperta Carington, in
which Alexandra is depicted perpendicular in a drab
riding-suit, while her two little sisters sit on a garden*
eeat backed by a spreading tree.
Apropos to ladies’ clubs, the best authorities agree that
they are—to put if mildly—not always a success, owing to
feminine jealousy and the absence of those assurers of big
dividends —billiards and a bar. Some energetic club'
women organise exhibitions of old lace, quaint jewellery,
and any oddities they have in hand, to swell the general
fund ; and the afternoon tea, and the letting of the bed-
rooms yields a profit, of course, but they always lose on
the restaurant. And the jealousy comes in over the black-
balling—“ You pepper my friend, I pepper yours,” and so
i he thing dies. An amusing feature of a ladies’ club,
which existed six years ago in Melbourne, was the rush
for seats by the window looking into the street. Even the
most immaculate club-marm likes to stick a stuffed bird
in her hat and strike a thoughtful pose for the benefit ot
the pavement.
On 6th inst. a well-attended gathering of the committee
of the Women’s College fad took place in Sydney Town
Hall when the chief business was the totting up of the
booklets: £B3 16s. showing as the result of 1400 circulars
and the undermining persuasion of the determined col-
lectresses. At present the fund stands at £968 11s. 3d in
hard cash, and to ensure fresh and vigorous recruits it
was resolved that “ the names of ladies who assist in the
collection shall appear in the newspapers ” —also, that
those who give from ten shillings up will have their labels
writ large in the daily press. That is the sort of thing to
incite the professional philanthropist.
Weary of the vagaries of the woman wno runs riot over
draperies with an empty purse one or two long-suffering
firms elsewhere have adopted an original plan for separat-
ing the sheep from the goats. Thus: A man stands at
the door and politely asks each woman whether she wants
to “ price ” or to buy. If a buyer she passes in untaxed,
but if she vaguely declares she only wants to look round
then is she charged sixpence for a ticket entitling her to
feel delicate silks with soiled gloves—stroke rich plush
the wrong way or order bales of calico from the top
story, after the manner of her kind—only she must show
her pasteboard to each victim. It seems a good idea—
but, then, I can imagine—can’t you ?—how ninety out of
every hundred “ prices” would look Cerberus fair in the
ocular with the glance of a w'ell-behaved angel as they
softly admitted they had come to shop.
Vice-regality assembled on 10th inst. at Sydney Cri-
terion to sample “ The Parvenu ” and see Pattie
Browne climb a tree —which is no hardship to a
soubrette with round ankles, by the way. The d.c.
dressing was too de Medici for words. Lady Carington
sported a trained dress in mauve-pink silk with high back
and collar and puffed elbow sleeves (our Social Beacon
never dons decollette at the theatre) with mauve aigrette
and diamonds in the hair; Suede gloves and diamond
bangles with long opera-cloak of cream, accordeon-pleated
chiffon flowered with an exceeding flower, and finished
with a yoke and Medici collar in sap-green velvet. Miss
Walenn, yellowish frock with brown moire sash. Another
lady in the vice-regal party resembled somebody's shadow
inasmuch as she was in raven’s-whig black from head to
heel—gown, gloves, bracelets, and all; and Baron Caring-
ton looked like a barber’s excelsior with his hair parted
in the centre and a white weskit. Pattie Browne
assumes a mocking horror reminiscent of a wild
co-mingling of a red-hot poker with a “ thumb” of blue
which does not pacify, but in the second act she recalls
violets and lilacs and Spring poetry In mauve inerv. and
violet velvet combined in a dodgy and fetching way. In
the second act Mrs. P. Bolton (Lady Pettigrew) wears
copper-pink broche draped in black net lace ; while Emma
Temple adopts flesh-pink silk. In the third act Pattie
Browne—who has all the “ fat”—wears a neat costume hr
cream wooUen with t hree hands of yellow velvet round
the hem, belt, collar and cuffs of the velvet and an
Arcadian hat in Leghorn aggravated with roods, butter
cups and blowavvays. She also wears slick black
hose, and the energetic way she shins up the
realistic gumtree in the foreground amply accounts
/or the dense patronage afforded to Urn stalls I notice w
growing tendency to gown the distracted stage female in
oarrotty brown in lieu of the subdued grey which has
carried all "before it for so long. In the Parvenu, Miss
Temple is bitterly persecuted in a slim-fit frock the exact
tint of strong cafe au lait.
1 hope those mackintoshed enthusiasts who paddled
over to the Association Ground on 7th were made aware
r.f the E.S.A.A. Club’s intention to postpone until 14th
ifist., since the latter date was a blue sky affair, though
bitterly cold and dusty, and the audience being numerous
i lie day was a success for everybody but the woman whose
nose turns red in a westerly. In the ladies’ reserve (they
have combed up that pasture at last, by-the-by) the nicest
get-up was in dahlia cashmere with black braided bodice,
Medici sleeves and collar of deep purple velvet with floral
t oque of pansies; while on the lawn your Sappho de-
cidedly approved of a dark-brown cloth adorned with
lines of brown velvet and velvet sleeves ; coachman cape
with high yoke collar of brown velvet and toque of Parma
violets ; a dark-blue made in the same way, cape and all,
with black Tosca hat and feathers and Empire black veil;
a gown in broken heliotrope checks over heliotrope velvet
panel: sleeves, high collar and frontal V in the velvet j
black feathered felt hat; brown and greenish checks over
brown panel,, ridged sleeves and collar, with toque of
scarlet roses; and a smoke-grey plain and designed
material gown with hatlet of pink ’santhemums. But,
then, what do you think of a woman with waratah-coloured
hair mounting a pea-green scoop hat ? or of a girl who
breasted a howling blast in an unbuttoned pilot coat and
a fluttering cambric shirt ? I expect she has to wear a
chest-protector now'.
In the realistic performance of that bouncing chestnut,
“ After Dark,” at Her Majesty’s, the only anachronism
your little Sappho found to object to was the incompre-
hensible horror of the slavey in the last thrill over the
entrance of the “ polis.” In real twopenny tram-ticket-
life she meets him half way with a seductive smile and
comforts him with cold pork and pickles before ushering
him upstairs to arrest the bosom friend of the family and
to see Bridget running shrieking before a “ foine malm in
daark bloo” is a wild improbability that elicits merely
desirive merriment from “ up bey ant.”
At the vice-regal reception I was sorry to see that the
new collars—cut open in the front—obtained with the
majority of people, no matter what shape or color their
necks were, and as this collar reveals the whole front of
the throat results weren’t alw'ays artistic. A woman with
a snowflake gullet with no visible sinews in it looks like a
picture with one on ; but a female with a fowl’s claw
cuticle, or a line of sunburn where her linen used to go,
had better avoid it as she would cold poison. What a lot
of muscles there are in the front of the neck, to be sure—
did you ever look in the mirror at your neck after a
Turkish bath ? No linen or lace is worn with the new
collar, which is simply made of the trimming or material
of the gown ; they are generally velvet just now. Fortu-
nately these pretty but impossible collars are not Hob-
son’s choice, and the charitable Medici collar still covers a
multitude of blemishes, even though it does make the
wearer resemble a hooded lizard with his back up.
Quite the latest artistic idea is to get your walls up to
suit the prevailing complexion of the people inside, and I
don’t think the “ reformer” is a bit too early, do you?
Many a tow-haired daughter has just missed a proposal
through the paternal taste leading to a mural mousey-
drab ; or, if her looks were ebon, to a staring
pea-green—but I wonder how people will manage who
have offspring with assorted complexions and misfit
hair ? I suppose in that case they will have their walls
painted in becoming stripes, and then tomato-haired
Sissy can pose effectively backed by a streak of geranium-
red, while dark-haired Mary Ann can languish against a
ribbon of old gold.
The mossy old custom of entering a ball-room hooked
on to a man’s arm is relegated to the limbo of bad form,
and the correct thing just now is for the lady to walk a
little ahead of the gentleman. A man and woman arm-
in-arm is one of the most awful sights possible unless they
are matched in height and can keep in step, but, as a rule,
he is six feet and she is five, and he walks with a preppy
stride while she bobs along in a hasty, undignified way,
clinging tenaciously to the lofty support accorded her
while people grin behind their fans. And how much
worse it is when she Is Goliath and he is David, and he
has to hook his elbow on a level with his shoulder to save
her having to bend double.
If the Sydney vice-regalities continue to whiz as they
have whizzed for the last week or so, their august suc-
cessors will either have to begin tearing round violently
from the moment they touch terra firma or else resign
themselves to the most odious kind of unpopularity.
Nothing is too obscure just now to be blazoned V.R. Even
a benefit concert in a suburban Town Hall “by the friends
and pupils of Mrs. Smith ” is beamed on by both Lord
and Lady Carington, who have absolutely infested
the theatres, and have patronised something or other
every night of the week. Of course this is very nice and
sociable of the distinguished emigrants-expectant, but
the fact that they are emigrants accounts for the milk in
the cocoa-nut, and when the new man arrives we musn’t
expect him to hustle around until his hair catches fire
Always keep your big trump for the last trick. Baron
Carington holds his final lev6e in October.
The long-talked-of Sydney Ladies’ Club has at last
blossomed into life. Its very nice chambers are over the
A. J.S. Bank, in George-street, and the one hundred mem-
bers-the Sydney One Hundred will sound well—are
quite satisfied with the success of their undertaking, so
far. As for the rules, admission can only be gained
through introduction by a member, and as the committee
do not supply name-lists, unless the would-be clubite
catechises her friends individually to discover who
belongs to it and who doesn’t, it is extremely
likely she won’t achieve membership at all. And this
is the Club’s great mistake. If they decreed that intro-
duction by socially well-known people is sufficient to get
the name of a would-be candidate put up, the Club would
escape the imputation of cliqueism. Objectionable people
could be kept out just the same if by any chance they got
so far as nomination, as the ballot-ball would settle the
question. As it stands, the Ladles’ Club seems to be an
institution which must enlarge its mental horizon, or
succumb.
I do not desire to cast any aspersion on the sweetness of
the sighs of Southern society, but don’t you really think
Victorian swains should take solemn warning from the
fact that in every number of a Melbourne weekly they
supply eager correspondents with plans and specifications
of “ how to make pickled onions ”?
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
The Enterprise Swimming Club held their first (fancy
dress) ball at Need’s rooms on 13th inst., when about 00
couples were present. A pretty disguise was a “My
.Sweetheart," in pink and white ; and a “Jockey ’ girl in
blue and white satin, with spurs, whip, and all, was very
well done The disguises assumed by the gentlemen were
not so successful.
The approaching marriage is announced of Miss Mary
Stawell, second daughter of the late Sir William and Lady
Staweli, of Victoria, to Mr. Edward Hawker, of Adelaide.
Lord and Lady Carington and suite, with Colonel Wal

inst., proved a very gay affair, and quite a number of
couples helped to unwax the floor. A matron in handsome
black silk and lace, and two Petersham young ladies also
in black, were in great demand.
The engagemont is announced of Miss Maud Anderson,
step-daughter of the Hon. H. .1. Wrixon (Vic.), to Mr.
Charles W. Stanley, brother to Capt. Alan Stanley, A.D.C.
to Sir Henry Loch, who married Miss Lilian Anderson, a
sister of the fiancee.
What already promises to be a very successful ball in
aid of the Bourke Relief Fund will be held in Sydney
Exhibition Building on Tuesday, 24th inst., under the
patronage of Lord and Lady Caringron, the Mayor and
Mayoress of Sydney, and a number of representative
people. Tickets (for gentlemen one guinea, ladies half-a-
guinea), to be had from the secretary, 25 Victoria
Chambers.
The Austral Salon (Melbourne) will hold its inaugural
festivity at the Gaiety Theatre on 27th inst. The Earl
and Countess of Hopetoun have accepted the club’s invita-
tion to be present.
The ball in honor of the New Zealand and Queensland
athletes eventuated at Need’s rooms on 9th inst., and was
in every way a success. Mrs. Burdekin —the Mayoress
wore a fresh-looking gown in shot-pink draped with pale-
pink tulle, diamond ornaments and a beautiful bouquet,
the gift of the committee. A pretty, novel get-up was in
cream raousseline de soie, with girdle of giant pearls.
From London the engagement is announced of Miss
Maud Summer, of Victoria, and Mr. Nash, of England.
Sydney Liedertafel advertised their jubilee (50th) con-
cert for 18th inst., the opening date of Sir Charles and
Lady Halle. Another high-class musical event billed for
the same date was the St. Cecilia Choir concert in the
Protestant Hall. Somebody must have suffered from
such a clashing.
The proposed conversazione in connection with N.S.W.
Art Society will not, as stated, be given by Mr. and Mrs.
G. R. Ashton personally, but by the members of the Art
Society', who passed a resolution to that effect at the recent
general meeting.
Sydney' Owl Club held their monthly hyginx over
Gunsler’s cafe on 12th inst. when a very large attendance
resulted. The proceedings consisted of a very enjoyable
concert and an equally enjoyable dance. Some of the
dresses were very pretty. A startler was the wearing of
red and green feathers over the shoulder —a parroquetish
innovation.
At a recent Adelaide ball the Countess of Kintore wore
a coronet of jet.
The other day the vice-regal authorities of a Southern
colony asked the officers of a man-of-war to a dance. One
of the invites arrived late and proceeded to pay his re-
spects to the hostess, whom, by the way, he had fre-
quently met. Said the lady as he approached : “ Mr. ,
when I want you I’ll send for you.” And this in the pre-
sence of the assembled guests.
Mr. J. Ellis Stewart, who, it appears, comes of distin-
guished lineage, got married in Melbourne the other day
to Miss Emma Staton. Mr Stewart, in an inspired
wedding-notice published in a Southern paper, is de-
scribed as “ Correspondent to the National Bureau of
Education, U.S.A. ; Correspondent to School Boards of
United Kingdom ; Correspondent to New York Society
for Prevention of Cruelty to Children, U.S.A. ; Honorary
Representative in Prahran, Victorian Society for Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals ; Honorary Secretary Council
Boards of Advice of Victoria; Ex-Honorary Secretary
Victorian Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ;
Ex-Honorary Secretary Victorian Humane Society; Ex-
Honorary Secretary Eye and Ear Hospital; Member of
Committee of Hospital for Incurables.” What glory !
The Melbourne paper which declares that Sydney girls
have not such complexions as those of its own city must
be mistaken. The girls of both cities use exactly the
same things.
it will be remembered that late Mr. Tom Monahan
Keogh, after succeeding to a fortune something like
£250,000, was killed at a Western race meeting a few
weeks ago. The selectors on his run have now sent to
his widow an admirably-worded address of condolence.
The Austral Salon (Melbourne ladies’ club) has grown
apace, and everybody who is anybody now belongs to it.
The inaugural meeting on the 27th in the Gaiety Hall is
to be a most toney affair. One thousand invitations are
to be issued, and tableaux of Moore’s “ Lalla Rookh” will
form the piece de resistance. On Ist August the smartest
dance of the season will be given under their auspices,
and Governor and Lady Hopetoun will attend. The
Countess is the patron, but as yet the long-expected £5O
has not been received.
In the Palmer (Q.) Chronicle, Miss J is described
by the compositor as having worn at the Limestone ball
“ a laoe shirt trimmed,” etc. The writer wrote “ skirt.”
Mr. J. O. Dodd, of Carcoar, died in Sydney the other
day. He had long suffered from hydatids, but an accurate
diagnosis was made too late. His death is deeply regretted
in a very wide circle of friends.
A most successful charity concert was held at “ Avon-
more,” Randwick, the residence of Mr. and Mrs. John
Walsh, on 12th inst., when a very strong programme was
presented. Kowalski was at his best in the polonaise in
E flat (Chopin), and Mrs. W. M’Donald sang Weber’s
“ Softly Sighs ” like an angel. There was a large audience,
and at the end of the concert Mrs. Walsh, who wore a
handsome gown of black silk and jet with diamond orna-
ments, entertained the performers and her friends to
supper.

The business of the Flemington (Melb.)
Borough Council usually starts by one member
proposing that the meeting do adjourn until
people have sobered up, whereupon everybody
else points out that the condition of the first

pass the estimates for a new drain, and go outside
to fight.
Cardinal Moran’s huge theological semi-
nary at Manly Beach has cost something like
£BO,OOO, and now some rascal has put up a notice
on an adjoining vacant lot to the effect that a
gigantic coffee-palace is to be erected right agin
the Cardinal’s door. Just imagine the prospective
complications ! Fifty theological students next-

A certain well-known exquisite Riverina
squatter once upon a time used to “ dress ’’ for
dinner, and as guests turned up frequently with-
out their claw-hammers, he laid in some half-dozen
dress-suits of different sizes. Two young fellows
arrived one afternoon, and were waited upon by
thehost’s valet, who presented each with a suit
which he thought would fit, one of the visitors
being something over five feet and the other over
six. By mistake the valet gave the long suit to
the short man and vicc-rcrsa, and when the pair
entered the dining-room short-’un had his trousers
and coat-sleeves tucked up, while the long-un s
pants were up to his knees, and he showed about
four inches of brace between waistband and waist-
coat They now dine in homespun on that station
Compensation and Confiscation.
The opponents of the proposal to compensate from
the revenue publicans, deprived of their licenses
by the Local Option vote, among other less cogent
arguments, assert, with undoubted justice, that it
would be unfair to tax a family at Wilcannia for
the pecuniary advantage of a suddenly-shut-up
Woolloomoloo publican and the prospective moral
benefit of Woolloomoloo residents in general. On
the other side it is shown that it would be mani-
festly unfair to turn out a man whose license —
subject to forfeiture hitherto only by misconduct
—had been viewed by him as a life-long permit,
with contingency of transfer, to sell alcohol on
certain premises, penniless on the world, master
of no craft, burdened by a wife and family
reared in affluence, or, at least, comfort,
and, consequently, ill - fitted to face the
poverty consonant on this sudden withdrawal
of the sources of subsistence. The Bulletin has
no hesitation in declaring its agreement with the
Local-optionists who object to compensation from
the public treasury, and is also in thorough con-
cordance with those who state that the removal of
a household prop, which long usage has made its
owners consider a vested right, without compensa-
tion is indefensible. The irreconcileableness of
these statements is more apparent than real; for
it will be admitted that the drying-up of certain
beer fountains will not assuage many drinkers’
thirst, and, therefore, that the compulsory retire-
ment of certain publicans from business will result
in a large increase of trade and consequent profit
to the remaining licensees. The inference is
almost unrnistakeable. Should not the neighbour-
ing publicans—whose businesses are thus im-
proved in selling-value and whose yearly re-
turns are largely increased —reimburse to the
State the sums paid as compensation to re-
tiring hotel-keepers by means of an increased
license-fee, either periodic or permanent ? To
this there can be no logical objection; foi* if
you divide the trade of five public-houses among
four, it must result not only in a relative but also
in an absolute increase of profits through a lessen-
ing of expenses in the saving of one house’s rent,
its license, its rates, its wages, its family support,
and wear and tear generally. It is impossible to
please everyone, but this plan—for which the
Bulletin claims originality and an equitable sim-
plicity that may hitherto have prevented its pro-
posal— seems to combine a consideration for the
right of the individual and the claims of the
community that should recommend it to
both liquor and anti-liquor parties. We fail to
see how the temperance party can have any objec-
tion to the tagging of such a stipulation on to
the Licensing Act, and if the publicans want
further arguments in its favour, we need only
point out how gladly traders in any walk of
life would increase their monopoly by buying out
rivals on a system of payments spread out over a
number of years. In the interest of the poor, so
far, neglected, grog-consumer, someone may novr
interject that the landlord will pass the cost of
increased license on to his That may

proved accommodation and the obtainal of pure,

Some little time ago an eminent Victorian
barrister was brought to Sydney to plead in a
heavy Riverina case, his brief being marked 500
guineas. A N.S.W. counsel, also engaged in the
case, refused to join him unless his brief was simi-
larly marked. As the attorneys could not do this
the Melbourne man pocketed Ids fee and returned
home.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK,
Theatre Royal J. L. Toole.
Her Majesty's “After Dark.”
Criterion “School.”
Darlinoiiurst Skating Kink.
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Opera House “Boccaccio.”
Theatre Royal “ Flying Scud.”
Alexandra “Sweet Lavender.”
New Bijou “ Joseph’s Sweetheart.”
Princess’s “ David Garrick.”
Victoria Hall The U.S- Minstrels.
Sydney Royal has been invariably crowded
from Mr. Toole’s opening night up to date. As stated
last week, the “ Don ” will be the next production,
but, despite Toole’s anxiety to air his “ infinite
variety,” the management, quite satisfied with the
present treasury, wish to defer laying bare J.L.’s
Toolishness as long as possible.
At Her Majesty’s (Sydney) good business
prevails. This is chiefly due to good staging,
especially the realistic rush past of the locomotive
with the night express. Here we are authorised
to state that there is no truth in the rumour that
Hazlitt has accepted the Commissionership of
Railways, and are also reminded that in a Leeds’
production of ‘’After Dark” the engine cut off
the master-carpenter’s fingers. “ Old Tom’s ”
recognition of his daughter is a pathetic and
highly effective piece of acting. Young Greena-
way— not so preachy as in the “Orphans”—
deserves a line for his fine forward fall in
the fourth act, and Harry Jewett his
drooping moustaches and plastered - forward
locks make him resemble G. Y. Brooke —as usual
plays the villain, quietly but effectively. How is
it that one so unvaryingly virtuous in private life
is doomed to such an unending career of villainy
on the boards? With some actors the processes
are reversed. On July sth the venerable “After
Dark” will be phlebotomised, and a transfusion of
fresh blood will also take place, for William Rig-
uold, Roland Watts-Phillips, Bessie Rignold, A.
Greenaway, Madge Seymour, and Frank Ayrton
open at Melbourne Opera House in “ Nowadays,”
and their places will be filled by George Rignold,
Alice Norton, Maribel Greenwood, Hoyt, Hazlitt,
and others.

At the Criterion business has been patchy;
sometimes the house wasn’t big enough, on other
nights it yawned. “Parvenu” deserves better
things, and those who don’t interview Anson be-
fore Saturday—when Robertson’s “School” will
be staged—will have missed something worthy of
a mental pigeon-hole in the vicinity of his Eccles.
Here we might remind “Dot” Boucicault that
it isn’t usual to have a float on your line when
fly-fishing, and if Pattie Browne would refrain
from saying “ Leaner !” at irritating intervals she
would eliminate any lingering desire of oui’s to
“Bantingise” her “fat ” part. Miss B. is to be
congratulated on the modest agility of her tree-
olimbing; several people who have gone “apur-
pose ” on several nights, don’t know the colour of
her hosen yet.

The substitution of “ Boccaccio ” for
“ Paul Jones,” at Melbourne Opera House, means
a considerable loss of prestige to the Nellie
Stewart season. Saturday night’s performance,
with its frequent periods of solemn silence and
costly abundance of undeserved floral tributes,
partook of the character of a high-class funeral
assisted by a choral service. By this time, doubt-
less, the ceremony is going with a little more dash
and spirit, and melody has vanquished discord,
but under no circumstances can “ Boccaccio,” in-
differently played in several places, avoid un-
favourable comparison with its predecessor. The
story and dialogue passed muster a few years ago,
when nothing better than a combination of
puerility and legs was looked for. There was a
time when the maunderings of those three
musical fellers (whose idiocy finds vent
in playing on their old umbrellas) were
vaguely understood to be funny. They are
insufferable now. A trio of genuine artists like
Snazelle, Gourlay, and Hodson can do no more
than arouse the pity of the many, and the irri-
tating cackle of the few, throughout the first act,
with an occasional laugh later on. What bright-
ness there is in “Boccaccio” falls to the girls,
chorus, and principals, the latter including a
couple of damsels whose lack of excellence is in
strict accordance with the quantity of bouquets
heaped upon them. The enormous success of
“ Paul Jones ” will ensure big business for the
present production, but it will be generally re-
garded as a glittering disappointment all the
same.

Madame Burton presents a noble spectacle
in the name part (which Nellie Stewart was to
interpret on Tuesday and alternate nights there-
after) and fills the billet with all possible intelli-
gence and sweet music. Snazelle, as Lamber-
tuccio, and John Gourlay, as Lotteringhi, do their
utmost under adversity : likewise Hodson. Wood-
field, too, plays the Prince with humour in his
opening scenes, and Miss Ida Osborne impersonates
the inevitable old woman conscientiously. Other-
wise the company falls yards short of the “Paul
Jones ” standard. Miss Lillie Hamilton (Mrs.
Hamilton Clarke) makes but a tolerable kind of
giddy spouse, and appears to have got there,
instead of the arch Aggie Kelton, by some
mistaken law of selection. Mr. Robert Kennedy’s
pretty little tenor voice is all he has to recommend
him, and on one occasion on Saturday he lost his
redeeming quality by getting horribly out of gear
in a duet with Madame Burton. Again, Miss
Florence Young, a shapely, promising novice with
a good voice, struck the wrong key at a critical
moment, and so spoilt the best efforts of orchestra
and chorus. Miss Ivanova is satisfactory, but
tliiu, and the scenery seems showy rather than
correct. In the attempt to give distance to a
shallow stage, the artist has painted a river clean
out of the level. “Boccaccio” can scarcely help
crowding the Opera House for its three weeks’
run, as per reason above stated.
** # *
“ Sweet Lavender ” loses a little of its
fragrance at the Alexandra, where a popular-
priced audience likes the pathos or fun to be laid
on with a mop rather than with a camel-hair-
brush. A premature stampede from the sixpenny
gallery last Saturday augured badly for the pros-
pects of Pinero’s beautiful comedy, and as the
plot offers no scope for slinging in a breakdown or
a burst of blood and thunder, it may unhappily
have to go before its poetry begins to be under-
stood. Frank Thornton’s version of Dick Phenyl
is still more amusing than comprehensible, and
Lavender shows little improvement except in ap-
pearance. Of other old friends Miss Annie Tay-
lor is good as ever, while Cates has visibly im-
proved his impersonation of the Yankee. Of the
new-comers only Miss Ada Lee is thoroughly ac-
ceptable. Mr. Eille Norwood (who presents a
half-trained appearance) finishes a bad last.
** * *
At the Princess’s recitations by Olive
Berkley and Oracle Hopkins have been addded to
the “ Fauntleroy ” show as that bilious narrative
seemed wanting in weight this trip. A mixing up
of the rival damsels is likewise taking place, and
his little lordship now increases the realism of her
performance by being several sizes bigger in one
act than another. But the stuffing has dropped
out of this dramatic doll, and when Henry Ed-
wards takes his benefit this (Thursday) evening,
they will further introduce a scene from “ Mer-
chant of Venice.” On Saturday next the fair
Mrs. Potter appears with the fair Bellew in
“ David Garrick,” not in “Romeo and Juliet” as
was first announced.
“Joseph’s Sweetheart” is still shaking her
little head to large attendances at Melbourne
Bijou, and Charles Warner is giving his final
gasps at the Royal. To-night sees the last of
“Dora” and “The Barrister,” in both of which
pieces Miss Graci'e seems to follow up her recent
advance movements. To-morrow (Friday) will be
sacred to Mr. C. W.’s benefit and farewell appear-
ance in Australia, a country that has learned to
honour his undoubted ability in the breach
rather than the observance. Now that he is
really about to tear himself off to Drury
Lane, however, there should be something
of a rush to “ Charley’s ” benefit, notwith-
standing that the public have grasped the fact
that very few benefit performances possess any
sentimental claim upon their pecuniary regard.
They all do it, though. Irving and Ellen Terry—
the one making a great income and the other
drawing a colossal salary—take their “ benefits ”
regularly. Toole had a benefit, the other day,
when the management seemed most in need of a
little incidental comfort. And, by the way, our
old friend Herbert Flemming is to have his ben.
and last appearance on Saturday week morning,
also at the Royal. Herbert is fairly entitled to his
turn, after seven years of constant service with the
Firm, and all the talent has been placed at his
disposal.

Harry Rickards folded up his tent on
Saturday, but the Victoria Hall niggers continue
tli€|ir joyful resurrection of exhausted gags to
moderate business. A plump and pleasing girl of
31 stone in weight, and two younger enormities
are exhibiting their adipose tissue at Kreitmayer’a
Waxworks, the Cyclorama is compiling another
dividend, and two or three other flourishing
entertainments have removed to Sydney.

“ After Dark ” had but a mild admiring
crowd to witness its production at' the Adelaide
Royal, and Wybert Reeve’s endeavour was de-
serving of more encouragement. Nellie Stewart’s
phenomenal success in Melbourne has led the
MacMahons to postpone her visit to Adelaide, but
as they have taken the theatre they must send
something along, and Grattan Riggs has been
chosen to do damage once more. He will start
with a new piece. “ Eileen Oge ” —that is, new to
Adelaide. Frank Clark has made a good start at
Garner’s with the Ideal Company and the Messrs.
Harvey.

George Darrell succeeds H. H. Vincent as
general acting manager for Williamson and Garner,
and the Meicurial will have to put his nose to the
grindstone. Vincent did an enormous lot of work,
fcr he would act an important part at the Royal,
stage-manage the piece, and be at the same time
acting-manager both for Princess’s and the Royal.
No wonder Musgrove offered him £2400 a year for
Sydney.

Dear Bulletin, —Will you allow me to
say a few words about a paragraph which appears
in The Bulletin to the effect that I am said to
have commenced life as a chorus-singer under
William Saurin Lyster’s management at this
theatre? I was born in Englafkl, have never sung
in the chorus, and the first time 1 went on the
stage was as prima donna contralto of the Carl
Rosa Opera Company. My first visit to the colo-
nies was in November last. Apologising for trou-
bling you, and hoping you will contradict the
paragraph, believe me sincerely yours, Marian
Burton. Opera House, Melbourne.

London Era Almanac asked a number of well-known
“Players”: “How would you prefer to pass old aye ?”
J. L. Toole’s reply was: “By taking the first turning to
the right.”
Says a London paper:—“l notice that some so-called
principals fancy that the audience would rather have them
bow their acknowledgments twice or three times before a
lesser star is permitted to do so even once.” True, oh
critic ; Sydney audiences have lately had some experiences
of the kind.
Having given 20 dollars to the ’Frisco Karl Formes’
Monument Fund, Adelina Patti, it is alleged, wanted her
name placed at the head of the list as the contributor of a
hundred. The local papers give her and Tamagno “ rats ”
for their meanness.
Mme. Norman-Neruda says she would not take 1000
guineas for the violin she uses in public.
To clear away all thoughts of jealousy, a Collins-street
photographer displays two big photos of Harry Edmunds,
as Lord Dorincourt, one embracing Olive Berkley, as Lord
Fauntlcroy, and the other similarly cuddling Oracle
Hopkins. It is a fact that Olive kisses Grade very nicely.
Barry Sullivan was a particular but kindly man at re-
hearsal. One of his troubles was to get strange performers
to do the last act of the “Gamester” aright, but he gave
everybody most valuable instruction. He was not a bully
like Macready, or—anyone else, and he never boozed up
actors, like Charley Dillon.
Sir Charles Hall 6 does not look hopefully on Ormond’a
idea of the Melbourne chair of music. It seems that Aus-
tralian painters and musicians must go to the treasures Of
Europe for their instruction, for some time to come. One
of the advantages of a devotion to literature is that its
masterpieces are current all over the globe. Your Shakes-
peare, Homer, Dante, Cervantes, hang on your own wall.
Mr. Charles Arnold writes to say that no one has any
right to produce “ Hans the Boatman ” in Australia.

Sergeant M’Carthy, late “super” master at Her Majes-
ty’s Theatre, died in the Sydney Infirmary last Sunday
morning from exhaustion supervening a fit with which
he was seized on the preceding Saturday night. The
deceased formerly belonged to the 48th (Foot) Northamp-
tonshire, and was brought to the colonies by Mr. George
Rignold as drill-instructor for the military drama “Youth.”
When the drama was taken to Sandhurst (Vic.) by the
MacMahon firm, Grattan Riggs, Frank Cates, and Lance
Lenton had to appear before “Mac” to be put through
their facings. The trio dressed by their right, Riggs with
his obese proportions, Cates and Lenton with their thread-
paper build. “Mao” ran his eye over them, gave a sigh,
and said in the richest of brogues : “God help the coun-
thry that’s dipinding on yez !” M’Oarthy was invaluable
as a “ super” master, and had filled the post for some
time with Augustus Harris of Drury Lane.
A self-styled “Australian actor,” who always was noisy

Tom Buckley’s wife and daughter, May Vivian and
Virginia .Vivienne, were highly praised by the Adelaide

Someone advertises in a Rockhampton paper, apparently

satisfied Mr. Palmer would do justice to the comedy por-
tions of the play; while in the emotional scenes he
expected Mr. Palmer to excel him ; while as a singer no
comparison was desired. Others have tried to pourtray
this character, only to fail ignominiously. They have
neither the voice, presence, or talent required, or the
children, dog, or scenery.”
The Hawk goes for Mesmerist Kennedy. It admits that

Prof. Douglas Archibald has arrived in Sydney from
America with Edison’s latest thing in phonographs. It
talked off a message from Gladstone to a large assemblage
of theatrical and other personages at a fashionable Sydney
hotel lately. When it had finished, the trouble began—
everybody wanted to communicate alcoholic-tinctured
messages to its little tin ear, which should from its plastic
palate, icons after bear their sonorous accents quivering-
down Jhe grooves of time. At last a well-known Thespian
got a show—bravely and briefly, but with a decidedly
whisky-and-soda intonation, he ejaculated: “I ” (largo
I) “am Fred-e-rick Fitzaltaniont, the original Romeo.”
That filled the machine right up.
According to Harry St. Maur, he has purchased

At the old Queen’s Theatre, Melbourne, the prompter
got a ben. once a year, in recognition of his taking about

Sara Bernhardt lately declared to an interviewer that
she never had any intention of impersonating the Virgin,
though she thought of organising a miracle-play on
Haraucourt’s poem, in which she would have played the
Choeur des Femmes or Mary Magdalen. Further on
she said : “ In any case, I am going away now for 22
months—England, America, and Australia. The further
the better, so far as I am concerned. I have often thought
that I should like to tumble off the edge of the world-
down, down, down, on to some star. Tell me, do you
think they would be astonished to see me ?” Tub Bul-
letin hopes that when Sara does come to Australia she
will not tumble on to any star. Stars always hate one

Chapter I.— Chronological.
It was in the year that Benjamin Babbidge
was Mayor of Brisbane. It was also in the year
that Blue-Ribbon Booth conducted a mission in
Brisbane. I remember those two facts well,
because the hero of this over-true anecdote was a
great friend of Ben Babbidge (whose name I also
remember as making rhyme with “cabbage ” in a
Wonderful one-horse localisation of a thre; orse-
and-a dog pantomime run by D’Arcy Stanfield and
Amy Horton); and because, when Booth invited
Babbidge (as Mayor of Brisbane) to preside at one
of his meetings, Benjamin wont to my hero to ask
him to string together for him a suitable speech,
and my hero responded cob amove, for they were
convivial and congenial souls. It is not generally
known that, in tutoring 8.8. for his rather angu-
lar task, Beaton (for such is part of my present
hero’s name; 1 don't give the whole of It as lie is
extant in Brisbane) proposed that the pair should
walk to the scene of the lecture in the Exhibition
Building, at Bowen Park - quite a mile and a-half’s
journey ; nor is it popular knowledge that Beaton
in the between-whiles of inculcating the “points”
to be dwelt upon by the Mayor as chairman of a
teetotal gathering, considered it necessary to call
in, cn route, at every pub. on the road and wash
down Temperance Reform in vinous good wishes ;
but it is matter of well-remembered public history
that Mayor Babbidge did preside over Booth’s
great gathering in a very roseate humour, and
that his speech was a striking departure from the
austere doctrines usually promulgated by bigoted
teetotallers.
Having, by these statements of well-known his-
torical facts, fixed the year, which those interested
can find out for themselves by searching the records
of Mayoralty or Temperance Booms, in Brisbane,
let me, as calmly as I can, proceed to relate
some marvellous psychic occurrences that put into
the shade all the alleged miracles of Madame
Blavatsky and of the
Sacred Brothers of
Thibet. When Oliphant
declared that it was
possible to disintegrate
the soul from the body
and give the liberated
spirit free range over this
planet, he only asserted
half of a psychic common-
place. Bulwer Lytton’s
great Armenian conjurors
who could render them-
selves invisible, and Vic-
tor J, Daley’s pretended
“ Ring of Invisibility ”
(see a late Bulletin),
arc mere fringes of the
mighty possibilities of
psychic science. I know
ray ensuing narration will
be discredited, but I am
content to take my stand
with Copernicus in the
matter of being scoffed
at because I am three
paces ahead of my time.
Let me asseverate, upon
my colonial say-so, that
the following events hap-
pened as I record them.
Chapter 11. Convivial
One Saturday afternoon
I met Beaton, and, as of
mutual consent, weturned
into a hotel together and
“ wined ” —or, to be ac-
curate in this veracious
chronicle, we “ whiski ed. ”
Beaton was (and is) an
extraordinary compound.
Ho was (and is not) em-
ployed in the carpet de-
partment of a Brisbane
wholesale firm. But his
aspirations ran to litera-
ture and plat form ora-
tory, and he was always
bursting over the bounds
of conventionality and
taking to Bohemian ink-
slinging. On this Satur-
day he was going through
one of these Bohemian
crises. He had insisted on celebrating St. Pat-
rick’s Day as a holiday, in spite of the wishes of
“the firm,” and had received his last month’s
salary from that combination. He was especially
caustic in conversation that Saturday afternoon on
the existences ground out by counter-jumpers and
carpet-baggers, and his soul burned for the more
congenial avocation of literature. He revelled in
his dismissal from sordid “graft,” and Bacchana-
lian lights gleamed merrily in his emancipated
eyes.
We talked of occultism and esoteric Buddhism,
of spiritualism and odic forces, we imbibed deeply,
and Beaton laughed to scorn a theory introduced
by myself that it was not only possible for a soul
to escape from its tethers in the body and roam
abroad at will, but that the body and soul together
could be absolutely transmitted in invisible clastic
vapour to any chosen distant part, provided the
apparatus necessary was all on hand.
“ Ha ! the apparatus, of course,” jeered Beaton.
“ So with Archimedes ; he could have moved the
world if he had a lever long enough and a fulcrum
to fit. But he couldn't get the lever. And so you
can crawl out of the bunghole of your theory by
excusing yourself for want of an apparatus.
Talking about bungholes, let’s have another—.”
“ On the contrary, my dear Beaton,” replied I—
“mine’s J.R.D.—the apparatus is all at hand.
Electricity is our forwarding-agent arid we use the
telegraph-wires. ”
*'■ Of course. I have spoken to a man who saw
a man who once knew the man who hung a pair of
boots on the wires, and was satisfied they had
been duly forwarded after a thief had stolen
them.”
“ I came to talk science and not trash,” I re-
plied angrily. “ I tell you seriously that there is
no drawback, provided the subject to be operated
agrees to my holding him body, soul, and vital
principle in chemical solution, forwarding him as
an invisible fluid by electric-wire, electricity itself
being an invisible fluid of a cognate charac-
ter ; re-liquefying him to tire vision, and recon-
structing him, as our school-drilhnaster would say,
‘ as you was afore you was. ’ ”
“ Then, perhaps, you’ll be good enough to trans-
port me out of this accursed town. I should be
transported if you would,” sneered Beaton.
“ Solemnly I will, if you desire it. I can send
you to my brother Tom in Rockhampton, if you
like. He’ll find you a novel telegram, to say the
least of it.”
“ I’m on.”
“ Honor ?”
“Honor bright. I’m on. Lead on. Stay;
have another. ” ;
Chapter IV. — Awful.
We had several “anothers.” Then I led the
way to Professor Pepper’s laboratory, which I
found in charge of young Harry Pepper. In order
to sufficiently arouse Harry’s enthusiasm in the
project I had to order more drinks, and a mystic
cloud hovers over my recollection of the esoteric
rites we observed and the awful ceremonies and
chemical processes through which we labyrinthed.
I remember we chloroformed Beaton and put
him in a vat full of mixed acids.
I remember fainting with horror when a blue
flame, with crimson tongues here and there light-
ing up the violet, permeated the cellar—did I tell
yon that the Professor’s laboratory was in a cellar?
—and a presence seemed to hover all around us, from
all parts of which tinkled multitudinous attempts
at articulate speech.
When I came to, Harry Pepper was grinning
like Mephistopheles through a lurid and purple-
flamed vapour, dense with greenish and snowy
streaks of lamb’s-wool style of smoke-clouds.
“ Where’s Beaton?” I asked.
“There,” pointing to a colorless liquid in the
retort. “ And I’m going to take him to the tele-
graph-office ; the operator on the Rockhampton
line is a friend of mine. We must, however, send
him in one message, or lie'll come out mutilated,
or short of some necessary organ or limb. You
can’t allow waste in concentrated, liquefied mor-
yon know. The contact of the electric
batteries will vaporise him and keep him fast in
one lot, so long as the message is not too much
interrupted. Think out a good, long subject for
a wire to your brother Tom, ”
I could only gasp: “Send him the market
report and commercial news in to-day’s Courier ;
BEFORE MARRIAGE.
AFTER MARRIAGE.
keep on till you use up that ” —pointing to the
retort—and I again relapsed into insensibility. I
suggested the “ market report ” because brother
Tom is in the commercial line of business.
How long I lay 7 in that condition I cannot tell.
My next recollections are of Harry Pepper and an
ass’stant, named Humphries (whom I last saw in
Sydney just before Christmas), rousing me up and
telling me the pubs, were closing for the night,
and that I had tetter pull myself together if I
wanted to carry home some “ stuff ” to see me
through Sunday. (The Brisbane Sunday-closing
law was just then having a spasm of strict ob-
servance.)
I staggered forth and succeeded in joining a
closing rush at the Criterion Hotel, whence I
carried home enough of the vital fluid to “see me
through Sunday.”
Chapter V.-— Missing.
'Mr. Mookelfort, of Charlotte-street, Brisbane,
is a well-known character, and a very prominent
citizen in Protectionist circles. But with ins
social and political ideas, this story has nothin? to
do. He chips in here in his capacity as head of
the house at which Beaton lodged.
It was Monday morning, the Monday morning
after the Saturday afternoon. I was sitting writ-
ing in my little room in Mary-street, and had
banished all thoughts of Beaton, beyond remember-
ing that we had had a remarkably lively time of
it, and wondering whether ho “ had a head on
him ” this morning, and what his views were
about counter jumpers and carpet-baggers, by this
time. A knock concussed at my door, and
Mookelfort ushered himself in. His first question
nearly sent me into a fit. It was—
“ Have you seen anything of Beaton ? ”
“Eh ! No -that is—er —not since Saturday,” I
muttered.
“No? I know all about Saturday. You were
seen drinking with him on Saturday, and he’s
never teen seen since.”
“Didn't he come home?” I feebly asked.
“No. He’s not in the lock-up either. He’s
left his traps untouched. The last seen of him
was in your company. I can’t trace him any
further. I think I’ll go and give information to
the police. Ho may have fallen in the river, or
got cracked on the head and robbed, or—or any-
thing.”
“I wouldn’t give information to the police, if I
were you. You would look so silly when he does
turn up.” (I said the words gaily enough, but my
heart was as sick as a stone-broke penitent.)
“ But Parslow and Hammond wish to take him
on again, and I want to find him to tell him so,”
urged Mockelfort.
“But, you see I responded more gravely—
“ the man may have reasons for hiding, and what
business is it of ours? If he’s in the river, or
cracked on the head, he’ll be found sooner or later,
and we couldn’t bring him to life again, anyhow.
If he is purposely hiding, why should we ‘put
him away’’” *
Mockelfort left only half satisfied, but promised
not to bother further in the matter. But what of
myself? How can I describe the unknown funk
1 was in? What had Harry Pepper and I done
in that awful cellar in those dimly-remembered
orgies which were now one nngraspable phan-
tasmagoria iu my memory? No more work for
me that day! I must go straight away and find
Harry Pepper. _
I found him seated in a dog-cart, just about to
drive off for the day. He carelessly nodded, and
stayed the off-starting horses when I beckoned to
him.
“ Where’s Beaton ?” I asked.
“In Rockhampton, I hope. Goodbye, my
horses are restive and I’m in a hurry.”
ATT Tvwrc Ur,,
Chapter YL—News of Him.
I staggered into a public house and confided my
fears to three tumblers of whisky and lemon,
Then I arose in firmer mood and walked to the
telegraph office.
“Is Mr. in?'’l enquired, mentioning the
name of Harry Pepper’s operator friend; “If so,
tell him Mr. Dipsomaniac would like to see him.”
“ No, sir. But liere’s a telegram for you,” said
the counter-clerk.
I took the missive. It was from Rockhampton.
My heart almost stood still as I read it, then
fluttered furiously, then thumped slowly and
prodigiously, and finally jerked and stopped and
jerked again so spasmodically that I burst into a
loud, maniacal peal of laughter.
It was all true, then. It was not a dream. We
had “occulted ” Beaton to Rockhampton, for here
was my brother Tom’s message announcing his
arrival.
The telegram ran thus :
To Dipsomaniac,— Beatdh has re-precipitated. Some-
thing wrong, however. Crystallisation apparently not
followed proper basic laws. Right leg attached to left-
side socket-front backwards-and vice versa. Sonl
hovering around in blue flame, apparently too large for
reformed body. Wire explicit instructions. {Signed)
Brother Tom.
As soon as I had calmed down my agitation I
sent the following telegram to —
Brother Tom,— Bottle fragments and flame carefully,
await instructions; must read up authorities. ( Signed )
Dipsomaniac.
I dived deeply that night into realms of for-
bidden knowledge, but my sacred vows to the
Brotherhood prevent me taking my readers
generally into my confidence. (Real earnest en-
quirer’s after esoteric truth can be fully informed—
-071 terms.) Next day, I was enabled to send this
telegram to—
Brother Tom,— Re-dissolve Beaton in elecric hath with
fiuoboric, picric and nitro-hydroohloric acids. Cause the
blue flame of his soul to pass in a stream through bi-
sulphide (old bisulphuret) of carbon. Artificially freeze
by ammonia process; subject to a pressure of four
atmospheres. Then simultaneously, by means of re-
agents re-precipitate the body and throw tiro soul in one
vessel, not letting the temperature rise above CO deg.
Fahrenheit, until Beaton is complete. Then follow the
usual esoteric directions for applying warmth and setting
going the vital principle. First food should be strong
beef-tea and old whisky. ( Signed ) Dipsomaniac.
A few hours later this telegram was handed to
me :
To Dipsomaniac,— Beaton revived two hours ago.
Greedily drank whisky ; rejected beef-tea, but managed
some “Irish stew, with Home Rule fixings.” Is now as
tight as a boiled owl. What shall Ido with him. ( Signed )
Brother Tom.
I wired back :
To Brother Tom, —Put Beaton aboard the boat to Bris-
bane. Don’t trust him again by occult despatch.—
(Signed) Dipsomaniac.
I had hardly got home again when this was
placed in my hands :
To Dipsomaniac,—Beaton has vanished. I wash my
hands of the business. No further experiments for me.—
(Signed) Brother Tom.
I let it rest at that. Brother Tom had washed
his hands of Beaton. So would I. He was alive,
anyhow, and safe—that is, as safe as any other
man on a big bender could be. I drank bis health
in solitude and solemn silence.
Chapter VII. —He Turns Up.
Many months had elapsed, and Beaton had
passed out of Brisbane life as though he had never
been, I was sitting in the same room in Mary-
street where Mookelfort had found me one gloomy
afternoon, when I heard the footsteps of a visitor-
on the verandah. I went out and saw a little
man clad in the travel-stained habiliments charac-
teristic of the Queensland bush. He was wrinkled
and thin and yellow, and —he was Beaton !
“I’ve come back from the dead,” he gurgled
sepulchrally ; “come and have a drink with my
corpse. ”
I went. How could I refuse, knowing all I
knew ?
After sundry libations Beaton told me his story.
He had got drunk, he supposed ; and, separating
from me, he further supposed he must have wan-
dered down to the wharf and accidentally gone to
sleep in the Rockhampton steamer. “At any
rate,” he added, “I never came to my senses
until I was in your brother’s house up at Rock-
hampton. Then, thinking the police would be
after me for travelling without a ticket, and also
being pretty hard-up and out of a billet, I bought
a blanket, and started to hoof it in the Central
Districts. I’ve been on the wallaby ever since,
except two spells of typhoid fever I’ve had, and
I’ve got back as hard up as ever. I want you to
introduce a narrative of mine into Bobby Byrne’s
Figaro— ‘A Thousand Miles Humping Biuey’- to
give me a start. What say yon ? ’
Again, what could I say, knowing in my heart
that I was the sole primal cause of all his wander-
ings ? I promised ray
good offices with Bobby,
and Beaton duly made a
modest “ rise ” by his
tale. He has often
spoken since of his
tremendously odd experi-
ence in getting up from
Brisbane to Rockhampton
in a state of oblivion,
and without paying for
the passage. On such
occasions a cloud has
fallen on my spirit, but
I have been dumb and
have never contradicted
him. Nor did I ever ex-
plain to Mock el fort how
Beaton was electrically
transmitted to Rock-
hampton. 1 give the
secret to the world now
for the first time. If
every statement herein
made be not strictly and
literally true, then I give
you leave to call me
The Dipsomaniac.
Berlin Medical Con-
gress, next August, is to
collocate SCOO doctors.
But the doctors won’t tap
the sources of disease any
more than the lawyers
will go in for codifying
the law which they like
to leave a wilderness.
They will just go tickling
and trimming round the
leaves with the pruning-
knife when they ought to
take the axe and lop off
the branches’. With what
sort of a basilisk eye do
the doctors regard a
woman who never was
sick in her life? The
abnormal is their gusto.
The late Emperor’s
throat will be their grand
theme.

Wells, charged witli the murder of J. J. G'Hal-
loi’an at Downfall Creek, affords a singular con-
trast to Judge Mein’s jury-charge in the case of
Jones, of the Eidsvold. Wells caught, or fancied
he caught, O’Halloran m flagrante delicto with his
(W.’s) wife, and killed him. The C.J. argued it
wasacase of justifiable homicide; and, on the jury
returning a verdict of manslaughter with a recom-
mendation to mercy, prisoner was discharged.
Jones, on the other hand, was sent to gaol for life.
We read that amongst the catch-words, or
time-procurers, of the English Parliament the
most marked is Balfour’s “Very well, sir.” This
he repeats constantly by way of marking his divi-
sions, sub-divisions, and the progress of his ora-
torical paragraphs. Sir Charles Russell’s pet
expression is “Let that pass ” ; Gladstone, when
he wants time, takes a drink ; Goschen clears his
throat, and Harcourt drags out a long“ A-ah!”
In the Australian Senates the three favourite
phrases would seem to be —“ Howsumever, as I
wos a-sayin’, an’ I’ll say it agin,” “Yeraliar!”
and “ Come outside an’ do it!”

A Southern county court judge last week
told a man, who when in Sydney was known as

adulation as this.
Canon Wilberforce recently said that “the

Succi, the Fasting Man, was at latest

Kemp, Frank Farnell, M.P., unblushingly re-

Trades-unionist Spence denied the other
day that increased wages caused an increase in the
cost of production, and instanced the fact that
highly paid white labour does more work than
poorly paid black labour. True ; but that does not
affect the point at issue, for if you increase the
wages or shorten the hours of the white man you
will increase the cost of production, though pro-
bably not in direct proportion to the alteration.
Again we say, parting with noble Henry
George, that Robespierre wouldn’t have been
worth a cent as a throne-destroyer if he had been
billed in streamers all over Paris, like Johnny
Toole or Charley Warner. Fancy: “Maximilian

Great lecture. Be in time. Only three francs.

The Case of Mrs. Moeller.
GREAT EXCITEMENT IN SYDNEY.
In these days of talking dolls, telegraphs, ocean
cables, telephones, microphones and other electric
inventions, when the occurrences in one part of
the world are telegraphed to the farthest point
therefrom in one day, and when a traveller makes
a journey right round the globe in (!3 days, it
takes something out of the common to startle a
community, but the late experiences of Mrs. Lanre
'Moeller are enough to startle the dead. Mrs.
Moeller, who resides at Newtown, N.S.W., is a
nativeof Germany and came to this country some
years ago. She has suffered from Liver and
Kidney complaints for years, about three months
previous 'to the present time was completely
prostrated and -unable to work; of the
ankles and lower limbs having set in. We diag-
nosed the case ourselves and can truthfully assert
that it was a case of advanced dropsy due to
relaxation and enfeeblement of the membranes of
tlie Liver and Kidneys, which permitted the waste
fluids to exude through them into the muscular
ti sue. We advised the use of Clement’s Tonic
and it was taken for some weeks and has resulted
in a complete cure. Mrs. Moeller herself thus
describes her case :—“Stanley Laundry, Georgina-
street, Newtown, N.S.W. I can with confidence
bear witness to the wonderful efficacy of Clement’s
Tonic in curing Liver and Kidney disease. I
have long been a victim to indigestion (caused by
liver complaint) and an affection of the kidneys.
I suffered terribly from headaches, pains in the
back and side, with obstinate constipation. No
one except myself knows what my sufferings have
been. I was always tired and languid, with no
ability or inclination to perform my daily work.
My tongue was furred in the morning, with a sour
taste in the mouth, and frequent vomiting; one
day I would be pretty well and the next very
distressed or completely prostrated with a very
confirmed languor. This went on until I was so
ill I was completely done up, and quite unable to
move. My ankles being swollen as thick as my
thighs, I consulted physicians all of whom pro-
nounced the case one of Dropsy, they variously
ascribed the cause to be heart, liver or Bright’s
disease. The kidneys were undoubtedly diseased,
because the swollen ankles when pressed with the
finger would leave a dent in the place for days,
and it was easy to press the end of the finger an
inch deep, when the hole would not fill up for
four days. I had heard of the wonderful cures
affected by Clement’s Tonic and commenced its
use. I took three bottles, and the swelling in the
ankles commenced gradually to subside, I con-
tinued the medicine and am now completely cured;
my ankles are their usual size, I have no aches nor
pains, and can do a good day ’s work with pleasure.
My tired, aching feelings have all disappeared,
and I am confident I have been rescued from an
untimely grave by the wonderful virtues of
Clement’s Tonic. My address is at the head of
this letter, and I will reply to any communications
if a stamped envelope is sent with inquiry, as I
consider it my duty to publish a record of my
wonderful cure.—Yours very gratefully, Laure
Mleller.”
Mrs. Moeller’s case is only a prototype of many
others in this country. She obtained a cure by
persistent treatment,' and this is the only way
chronic disease can be cured. A half-hearted
treatment is never satisfactory. You must con-
tinue the remedy for a considerable time if you
want to cure long standing cases. The tendency
after ascertain age is always towards decay, there-
fore if debility has been eating its way into the
system for months or years, it is very unreason-
able to expect one or two bottles to restore perfect
health. All bad cases require protracted treat-
ment.

The Bulletin sincerely hopes that Premier
Parkes’s leg, on which ho has travelled extensh ely
for some weeks past, will soon get thoroughly well.
For one reason, people are sick of seeing it. stated
in print that Governor and Lady Oarington “send
him little delicacies every day,” and that some
self-constituted magnate or other “ writes as fol-
lows.” Who on earth supplies such information
to a grovelling press? The Bulletin is ready to
swear that Governor Oarington, if he does send
the old man a case of fizz, or a frozen peasant, or a
plate of tripe, doesn’t talk about it. The fact of
the matter is that Parkes's leg will be as good as
7000 votes for his party at the general election.

Says the Hawk (London) :
Lord Bertie, sou and heir of the Earl of Lindsey, whose
marriage was described by my foreign correspondent a
short time ago, returned with his Sydney bride-last week.
And not long ago aJ. R. was struck off the N.S.W.
Commission of the Peace for alluding to England
as a “foreign” country- in which light the
British Tory organs evidently regard- Australia.
Here, again ;
In 1858 Lord Norraanby was appointed Governor of
Nova Scotia, subsequently becoming successively Governor
of Queensland, New Zealand, and finally of Victoria,
N.S.W., which latter position he quitted in 1834, to the
general and universally-expressed regret of all classes of
the community.
And yet Victoria is not situated in N.S.W. at
all. On the contrary, as every intelligent Eng-
lishmen knows, it is situated at Hobart, near
Melbourne, the capital of North Queensland.
* * *
Who would be a N.S.W. Industrial-school
girl? Branded in several places with a hot iron,
kicked on the groin, bashed over the ears and
transferred from one mistress to another without
the knowledge of the ble-sed Boarding-out De-
partment, which is supposed to keep a vigilant
eye on its proteges ! And what luck the branding
lady has ! When brought before the Parramatta
bench the honorary beaks, a set of localists, re-
fused to allow the Stipendiary magistrate to com-
mit her for trial, as was his clear duty, and insisted
that she be let off with a small fine! Another
plea for the abolition of the utterly rotten system
of honorary magistracy. The case affords as
gross an instance of the miscarriage of justice as
did the as yet unpunished vitriol-throwing affair.

Bishop Moorhouse says that cremation is
not undoetrinal, which is a point gained. Now
we learn that the cost of cremation at Woking
(Eng.) is reduced from a minimum of £3 to a mini-
minissirao of 3s. 6d. Now, what is the orthodox
objection to cremation? Simply because it is so
much like hell. We do not write this in levity,
but to put plain things in plain words. As to
the good Bishop’s saving-clause that earth-burial
is “more decent” than cremation, what does it
amount to? Why, big bustles w-o re decent only
last year.

There are just now very rew men and
women so strong-minded as to be absolutely in-
different as to whether or not their )x>dies are
dissected after death. The man who has a horror
of dissection will, on the average, also have a
horror of cremation. As time passes the world
grows more materialistic,
# * #
The best that can be said for most wed-
ding-presents is that they are merely useless, but
there are times when they cause more misery than
did the gorgeously embroidered night-gown pre-
sented to Hercules. James Bullock, a simple
boundary-rider, of Salisbury Plains, N.S.W., was
presented with 2000 shares in the Atlas Engineer-
ing Co., of Sydney, as a marriage-gift. If these
had been 2000 kegs of dynamite and had exploded
on delivery they would have saved James a heap
of trouble. The company bankrupted, and a call
of Bs. a share was made on the shareholders (who
numbered 23 in all, with individual liabilities
ranging from £BO to £3200), and James, it is now
decreed, has to pay £BOO or go insolvent. The
moral is old, and was first stated many years ago
by the eminent Mr. Joseph Geary : “If ever a
man offers you a horse cheap, ask him ‘ Why ?’ ”

The recent alarming succession of deaths
under chloroform at the Alfred Hospital, Sydney,
is as yet unexplained. There is still much mystery
as to the sources of danger under chloroform.
Most of the medical profession appear to think that
diseaseof the heart renders a patient unfit to take the
anaesthetic in question but the present writer once
heard that admittedly experienced and skilful
surgeon the late ■ ecil Morgan, whose record as an

Ex-parson W. H. O. Smeaton, now editing
a paper up North, has erupted into verse :
What nonsense ! ’Tis heated my head is
With Chateau Laflcte or Clicquot;
Can it be that the word I have said is
My heart's true confession or no ?
A dance to slow music, in rapture,
A vision in full as my thrall,
I confess to my absolute capture,
O ! Beautiful Bell of the Ball.

Now that the police and detectives have
failed to find Jacob Rick, and the clairvoyant
lady, who inserted herself into a trance and
looked down the trackless paths of the past in
search of him, has only offered a few general ob-
servations on the subject which are of no use to
anybody, we would suggest that a new scheme be
resorted to. Let it be advertised in all the papers
that someone has died and left Jacob a fortune of
£160,000, and that an additional fortune and a
mansion will be thrown in, provided he marries
the testator’s daughter, the same being a lovely,
blue-eyed maiden of 18, and the chances are that
Mr. Rick will arrive with such velocity that the
public will hear him whiz as he passes through the
air, and a number of people will be overturned
and stamped upon by the legatee in his frantic
rush to collect the money and the girl. At pre-
sent, so far as we see, Mr. Rick has no particular
inducement to show himself, for the instant he
turns up he ceases to be a public character and
drops into his original insignificance ; but there
are quite a number of dead men who would arrive
in great haste for a reasonable compensation, and

An old woman with a little history died a
few weeks ago at Balclutha, writes a N.Z. corres-
pondent to The Bulletin. She was only working
housekeeper to a poor old German carpenter, but
when she died it was found that she had left £2OOO
to a local storekeeper. The lucky heir knew very
little of his benefactress, and has not the remotest
idea why she left him the money, unless it was
because he always gave her credit when she
required it for herself or her employer. The Ger-
man, who was all along unaware that his house-
keeper was a capitalist, is much aggrieved that
she left him nothing, considering their inti-
mate relations for many years. He feels it all
the more, too, when he remembers a perilous
adventure they once had together. During a big
flood in’7B the cottage in which they lived was
carried down the river for several miles at night
with the pair of them inside of it, roosting as best
they could between the ceiling - and the iron roof.
The old woman was very stout, and when the
cottage threatened to capsize as it sailed along,
the German had to haul her from one side to the
other to keep it level. They were rescued shortly
after daylight, and lived happily together from
that time till the old lady’s death. How she cam-
by her fortune nobody knows.

Two fashionable young bank-clerks, whom
we may as well call Smith and Jones, pondered
ranch on “making a rise,” and agreed that there
was nothing like catching an heiress. Smith met
with an obvious interposition of Providence. He
travelled alone in the Tram-car with an old gentle-
man, who dropped a pocket-book stuffed witli
notes, and Smith on seeing it ran after the owner,
pocket-book in hand. The old gentleman was
profuse in his thanks. “Will you do me the
favour of calling at my house on Thursday evening
—if I’m not there my daughter will receive you. ”
“ Oh !” says Smith to Jones, “ I’m there !” Smith
duly went, and found that the old boy inhabited
a superb mansion. He was let in by a footman,
and received by the daughter ! This was in a
grand drawing-room. She was sorry papa couldn’t
see him, and gave him four half-crowns. He
dashed them at the pier-glass, from whence they
rebounded and smashed an article of vertu, valued
at fifty guineas. For this he was given in charge
to the police! But the old man relented and let
him off.

Theoretically, trust-money paid to a
lawyer on behalf of a client is, unless that client
lias given specific instructions for its investment,
available at call. The lawyer is only in possession
of it to the same extent as an honest bank-clerk is
in possession Of the bank’s cash. But when the
lawyer pockets it, puts it in a mine, or on a horse,
or gives it to a woman to buy sealskin cloaks and
hair-dye,-6r pops it into one of. his own little land-
Swindles, and -then plausibly, lies about it to his
client for two.years, or so,'he doo-n't embezzle it.
Gh no! Once prosecuted, the bank-clerk who
steals a couple of hundred usually goes to gaol
for a few years* even if his friends d.» wish
to make rostitution, but the lawyer who
annexes a-conj of thousand belonging' to the
maiden lady who believes in him because lie wears
a tall hat and is a churchwarden, doesn’t go to
..gaol. He is given time to commit suicide or to go
and scratch" up the money by shearing some of his
other clients. Attorney-General Simp-on has just

cany in procession through the, hall and to the rear of

sisting of a very vulgar mask, with a pipe in its mouth,
clothed in a battered cap and gown which would have
done credit to the head and" back of the fastest under-
graduate during my happy days at Cambridge. Lord
Oamnadon made an excellent speech (which was loudly
applauded), unruffled by the vulgarity of Guy Fawkes,
who frequently bowed his assent by the lowering and
hoisting of the pole. Icoukl not understand the conduct
of the Chancellor, in his full academical robes, seated in

Science is great, and of invention there is
no end. The latest thing is a scheme for applying
otto of roses and other scents, not in the old, mean,
degraded, underhand way by sprinkling the hand-
kerchief or the dress, but by injecting a drop of
the essence into the veins of the arm with the
hypodermic syringe and thus scenting the lady
herself in place of her clothes as heretofore. The
conception is a great one, and the man who struck
it will be remembered by posterity, along with the
giant intellect that first discovered victuals, and
the public benefactor who found out clothes, and
the genius who patented the original method of
coming in out of the wet, and the stupendous soul
who invented sleep—before that blessing was cor-
rupted and undermined by the villainy of the
bloated hypocrite and illiterate apostate who
invented early rising, and the still more stupen-
dous soul who first thought of thinking about
anything at all. And just here an idea strikes us.
When the evening dress gets a very little shorter
than it is now it might be as well to inject it into
the arm along with the scent. It is just possible
that clothes might be a trifle more apparent that
way than when worn in the present superficial
fashion, and, anyhow, they would take root in the
system, and would not present that lamentable
appearance of uncertainty which makes man so
often leave his home and fly into the mountains
for fear that they should prove the forerunners of
worse disaster.

Dear Bulletin, —I have discovered the
reason of the necessity for Shiels’ Divorce Bill,
the fadure of marriage, and sundry other things.
A friend of mine (female) and a widow now, hail
a most unhappy time of it with the dear departed,
a drunkard who left her with a debt-loaded farm,
a family of 12 children, the youngest a baby in
arms, and never a question as to how she
would live after he was gone. She bravely
faced the music, however, pulled through, and
though seven years’ struggling failed to clear
her entirely of her difficulties, it left her consider-
ably better off, and with a lot to be thankful for.
Marriage was being freely discussed one day in
her presence, and some one, aware of her unhappy
exper.ience,:asked her if she thought it a failure.
Looking her questioner straight in the face in
blankest astonishment, she answered : “ Why,
how can I ? I was only married to one man in my

They swore—it is a fearful thing—

They swore, and you may bet your boots
That they will swear again.

lifetime.” And being married to only one man in
a lifetime is the difficulty we can’t get over if
we don’t succeed in killing our man, and want to
live respectably. It sets us writing essays, and
hankering after Divorce Bills, and wondering
when women will be able to vote, and thinking
we would look well in divided skirts, and the poor
man suffers accordingly. Now, dear Editor,
a paragraph is going round concerning the English
ladies’ craze for men’s saddles, which reads the
wrong way to a colonial. Are you a colonial ?
and if so, were you brought up in the bush ? If
you ’were, you must know that our firmest-seated
riders amongst the bush girls have learnt to keep
their seats on a horse bare-backed, or in a man’s
saddle —but not astride. Perhaps the English-
women are trying to do without the horns of the
saddle ridden on by females nowadays. Give them
the benefit of the doubt, anyway—or are their legs
shorter than the average colonial’s ? lam colonial,
and have ridden astride of a man’s saddle when
skirts were worn a deal fuller than they are now;
I won’t tell you how many years ago, but it was
a question of a two miles’ tramp, or lead a horse
which had never carried a lady. My seat was
none of the surest, so astride it was—and that I
still live is evident by this epistle; but if ever I
catch my daughters at such an indecorous trick
woe betide them. And, apropos of horses, I saw
“Robbery under Arms” —and it (the stage
version I mean) made me so weary. When
I was young—very young—bushrangers after
the stamp of Claude Duval filled my dreams,
but a cuddlesome, comfortable sort of a bush-
ranger like Mr. Dampier makes was never
imagined by me. And Miss Lily has never skipped
round much through the gay Australian bush, or
she’d have a better idea of a bush maiden. Any-
way, one thing I can tell her : when a “ boy ” I
didn’t care about started to kiss me, he generally
did the screaming, or would like to have but for
shame’s sake. There never was any need to call
my brothers by the time I was through with him.
And that brings me to “ bushrangers I have met.”
Only one full-blown and one in embryo. They
were perfectly harmless, too, and had nothing
desperate-looking about them, except the ugly
feet of the elder man; as the old hand who cleaned
the boots remarked, “A fellow wants sixpence
extra for going over the ground on these boots.”
Feet so remarkably studded with bunions I have
never seen outside of a caricature, judging by the
boots. But he was a quiet man, and after staying a
night with us, Swapped horses in peaceable fashion
with our relatives, and departed without any
flourish. His companion was only remarkable for
his sullen demeanour and uncommunicativeness,
most noticeable in a house full of young people,
but he also went on his way, and it was not for a
time afterwards that we young ones knew that
the house had sheltered Power, the bushranger,
and the afterwards infamous Ned Kelly, since be-
lieved to have betrayed Power to the police. My
uncle had known Power as Johnston, a horse-
dealer, some said horse-stealer, back in the
“ fifties,” and I honestly believe he knew him as
Power, the bushranger, also. I can fancy I see
his sardonic grin now, when challenged by our
local trooper with having had that knowledge, and
the twinkle of his eyes when he told the trooper
“it was for him to prove that , and if he had sent
word to the trooper that Power was under his
roof, the trooper would have gone to the hills to
look for that same Power.” The horse he
“dickered ” with Power was advertised, but
found no owner in response, and Power told
my uncle when visited in Pentridge that tho
horse was honestly bought on the Sydney side, if
the money paid for him was not honestly come
by. I remember my sister’s alarm when, in
straightening up the room for the guests, she
found a revolver under the pillow. She was
young, and in her first impulse told uncle of her
find, v.. h a rider adding that she believed the
fellow was no good, and her consternation when
she found the “fellow” at her elbow listening
with a grim smile to her communication. Her
fear was not lessened when she was told she would
be shot if she mentioned the circumstance, but
that threat could not keep her from telling her
sisters. They were the only bushrangers I have
met; nothing Claude Duvalish about either, and
uncle sleeps the sleep of the just I hope. He was
a sarcastic old “ cuss” while living, and enjoyed
a joke thoroughly, so long as it was not at his own
expense Susan. Werribee, April 13th, 1890.

“ How are Americans liked in England ? ”
And Air. B. F. Larrabee, of 42 Chester Square,
ex-director of the “New York and Boston De-
spatch Express Company,” who has, recently re-
turned from a considerable residence in London,
answered : “ If they have good recommendations
and behave themselves they are well treated, but
they will like the English people, any way, when
acquaintance ripens into confidence.”
“ How do the English compare with the
Americans ? ”
“ The finest looking men in the world can be
seen on pleasant days of the London sea bn pro-
menading Piccadilly. The English ladies, how-
ever, are neither so neat in appearance nor so
graceful of form and movement as the Americans,
but they seem to enjoy more robust health.”
“Are English-people longer lived than our
people ? ”
“ I don’t know. I have not fully investigated.
But I remember once hearing read a newspaper
paraph entitled, ‘ Why do Englishmen Live
Longer than Americans ?’ That paragraph, by
the way, once solved a great mystery for me.”
“ Ah, indeed, another tribute to the power of
the Press ?” suggested the reporter.
“Yes, if you so please to call it. In 1879, when
I was residing at the Commonwealth Hotel, in
this City, I had occasion to do some business in
Washington-street. When I got to the corner of
Franklin, I seemed to feel a blow in the breast
and fell to the pavement like a dead man. When
I recovered my consciousness I was taken to my
hotel. I first thought perhaps some enemy had
struck me, but my physicians assured me that
such could not be the case, and advised strictest
quiet. For six long weeks I was unable to lie
down. I was violently ill, and my physicians
said I would probably never walk the streets of
Boston again. I did not want to die, but who
can expect to live when all doctors say he cannot?”
And Mr. Larrabee smiled sarcastically, and ex-
pressed himself very freely concerning the number
of common disorders which are controlled by
remedies which physicians will not employ.
“ But how about that paragraph ?”
“Yes, yes. When I was obliged to sit up in
bed day and night for fear of suffocation, and
hourly expected death, my nurse begged the
privilege of reading that paragraph to me. I re-
fused him at first, but he persisted. It described
my condition so exactly, that for the first time I
began to realise what had prostrated me, I was
filled with a strange hope. I at once dismissed my
physician and immediately began Warner’s safe
cure. In a few months I was restored to perfect
health, notwithstanding mine was one of the worst
possible cases of Bright’s disease of the Iddneys,
which all my physicians—and I had the best
specialists in Boston —said was incurable. I tell
you, when a man gets into the desperate condition
I was in, he doesn’t forget what rescues him.”
‘ 1 But were the effects permanent ? ”
“ That was five years ago,” said Mr. Larrabee,
“and for thirty years I have not been so well as
during the past five years. If I had known what
I do now, I would have checked the matter long
ago, for it was in my system for years, revealing
itself in my blood, by frequent attacks of chills,
jaundice, vertigo, typhoid fever, nervousness,
wakeful nights, etc., • etc. I took over forty bottles
before I got up and over one hundred and fifty
before Lwas well. I have commended that treat-
ment in thousands of cases of general debility,
kidney and liver disorder, etc., and have never
heard ill concerning it. I bank on it.”
“Speaking of paragraphs, how do English
papers compare with American in this parti-
cular?”
‘ ‘ Well, they have fewer witty paragraphs, but
the smaller papers, like the Pall Mall Gazette,
St. _ James’ Gazette, and Truth, abound in sharp,
incisive paragraphs without wit. In general,
American papers make the most of news, the
London papers make the most of opinion.”


Wolfe’s Schnapps will do you no harm.
Gaunt, the Melbourne watchmaker, is
dead, and will bo remembered most for the
chronograph he gave the V.R.O. —a big “ ad.”
you’ll say. He used to stand beside the judge, in
his box, and time each race, but he cared more
for racing than indefatigable Bagot or his Elisha,
Byron Moore, the model secretaries. Two of his
daughters are nuns. He clean-shaved, and always
passed for a comedian in the street.

THE REFEREE.
It is yet premature to hope for ultimate success
on the part of the Australian Eleven. The English
wickets have not yet hardened after the winter, and on
dead ground Turner and Ferris are formidable indeed,
u m ie beginning of the 1888 season one was called a
Terror” and the other a “ Fiend,” but before September
both got knocked about. Then, again, the English bats-
man has yet scarcely “got his eye in,” whereas the
Australians, after playing a whole season, with deck prac-
tice on the voyage and matches at the ports of call, must
be in splendid condition. As the season wears on they
,na y pot stale and the Englishmen must improve.
* * *
i he match with Cambridge University must be
regarded as having knocked a lot of useful glamour off
Australian bowling, especially as it followed directly after
that hard hitting by the M.C.C. at Lord’s. The English
amateurs are sure to slog when the wicket is decent, and
their bowlers aro_ not of much account. And if ‘‘Our
Boys can t punish inferior stuff (which the amateur
article always is) as fast and freely as the other boys can
smite Turner and Ferris, then it is a bad look-out for
them in the long run. We have always maintained that
English professional howling can beat our men on a hat*-
man’s wicket. At Cambridge we had amateur batting
compensating for bad bowling, and knocking up a total
winch was equivalent to 600 from the Australians, if the
difference in attack be considered. The Nottingham
match reads us another rough lesson.
* * *
The life of a professioner cricketer is not so re-
munerative as that of the “cronk” ped, the bullying pirn-,
or the “flash” sculler. In a cricket match there are!
including umpires, about 25 persona to be paid—even
amateurs get their bit—whereas in the other cases only
two parties divide the pool. Then again a cricket match
cannot be easily squared, and is consequently a bad bet-
ting-event. At least five or six men have to‘be “sweet-
ened, and what is known to more than sav two persons
cannot be held a secret.
* * *
Says a London writer:—“A representative
Lngiish team of cricketers would hot be considered com-
plete with the name of W. G. Grace omitted ; but splendid
a performer as this gentleman has been,in his time, it is
more than likely tha,t his actual value is over-estimated
now 7.. There is an etiquette observed in choosin" men to
play in sensational matches. In the first place, there are
the captains of first-class counties to be considered, and
so on, and so forth. This etiquette stands in the way of
ever getting the best men to represent a side, inasmuch
as the captain of a county team is certainly not the
youngest member of an eleven; but if.he elects to play
he probably crowds out a man who, as a captain, is pos-
sibly not so able, but who, as an all-round cricketer is
more serviceable.”
* * #
Dear Bulletin, I cannot concur in your
remarks re the sculling championship. When Ilanlan
came here several years ago, if any sculler had dared to
ass that mighty oarsman to row for £2OO, the Press and a
certain section of the public would have laughed the idea
to scorn. Hanlan was quite right in asking as much as
he liked, and Kemp, in wishing* to continue that practice,
is acting with great foresight, for, as The Bulletin has so
often contended, it should be the policy of every pro-
fessional oarsman to make as much “gilt” as possible ere
he turns into the “sere and yellow” period. First we
have a Canadian dictating how much the championship
prize is to be, and now we have another who wishes to
boss the show. Are we Australians, who have decidedly
shown our superiority in rowing over the entire world
to have no say in the matter at all? I should think
1 , Kemp gives way in this matter, he
should forfeit his own respect and his friends’ <r o od
opinions. O'Connor will yet have to prove he has the ghost
of a show for the championship before he is to be the
almighty Hairy Parkes of the rowing world. Fair play is
the weak spot of Australians, and—O’Connor knows' it
and wishes to work upon them. Of course The Bulletin
will look at it as a “ battle of backers,” but why Kerap’V
backers came in for the brunt, and O’Connor’s syndicate
is sanctified, I know not.—Yours, &c., Australian. '
[You say, why shouldn’t Kemp fix the championship-
stake at £5OO ? Hanlan made it that sum. What we
say is, that the fixing of the stake should not be left in
the hands of Kemp, or any other sculler, gaffer, shandy-
gaffer, or other interested person whatsoever. First
decide what is a fair stake, and then ipake the men
stick to it; otherwise the holder might raise it
to a thousand pounds or two thousand, ° and rhditlv
too, according to your letter. If O’Connor “wins
it, it is quite possible that he will streak hack
home and raise the stakes, in true American bluflin<>- style
against our scullers. What is a fair stake ? (»n reflection
wc think £5OO a fair stake now-a-days, as under the pre-
sent elaborate and expensive system of training it costs
more than £2OO to put a man in his boat fit to row for the
championship, and a man might lose money by winning a
£2OO race. Each man requires at least two boats and
very expensive boats they are. Each must have a
trainer who must also have a couple of boats The
men must be kept like fighting-cocks, the trainer’s
wages paid, hotel bills paid, incidentals paid—
you can take it from us that being “gaffer” to
a sculler is not all beer and skittles. However, this is
beside the point—let the amount of a fair stake be
determined once and for all by a disinterested
tribunal. What we think should be done is, let
the public subscribe for a championship trophy of some
sort, belt or cup or something, and draw up an agree-
ment consisting of one sentence, namely, that the holder
of that trophy is the acknowledged champion of the
world, and that he will row all-comers for it, for stakes
of so much aside; and let every challenger sign this
agreement before he is entitled to a race. If a man wo i
the championship after signing this agreement, then ha
could be made to row for the stake therein specified or
forfeit. At present any champion may raise the stakes to
a thousand or two thousand when so inclined, or mh-ht
quibble and argue and the championship might go“to
America and we never get another race for it. We know
what newspaper fighters are, and the American scullers
appear to be largely newspaper scullers. In fact, just
between ourselves, if a man raked New South Wales with
a tine comb, he might find one or more energetic newspaper
scullers in this country. The plan suggested above would
put things on a better footing.—Ed. B. J

Sydney made short work of Melbourne in the
Inter-University eight-oar race on the Yana last Satur-
day. Mr. George Upward, one of the best, if not the best
judge in the colonies, said that the Sydney crew were in-
finitely superior to the last Sydney Intercolonial eight.
If such be really the case, the ’Varsity men ought to keep
together and represent N.S.W. in next Intercolonial. On
Saturday the two miles were covered by Si dney in 10 min.
30 secs., and the whole journey in 13 min. 48 secs.

Mr. P. J. Clark was the first Sydney amateur
champion in wager-hoats, and as “ Jim ” had compara-
tively nothing to row against, putting a wager-boat race
on a programme was tantamount to handing him over the
“pot." Mr. Gerald Kennedy holds much the same
position now ; lie won the wager-boat race at St. Ignatius
College Regatta as a matter of course on Saturday.

London Hawk says that sculler O’Connor is too
narrow in the waist ever to he seen in the first class.
That seems to be what is the matter with the average
Ausjralee man, who is Hot built round as a gumtree and
almost flush from under the armpit to the hips, like a
Greek statue. The phenomenal human windmill—like
Spofforth, all legs and \Vings—is well enough in its wav,
but for strength and endurance in heavy work you want
men built like our best footballers and like the English
cricketers and blue-jacke ts.

The Spencers, although in the interests of sport they

leading at a quarter of a mile and about last for the rest
or the way, on which reckoning it is surprising that “our

The Melbourne Cup, with £lO,OOO added and a
second forfeit of £lO, dosed with 150 entries. Conse-
quently each horse’s present chance is worth about £75
on paper. This is rather different to the Eclipse Stakes,
consisting mainly of subscribers’ money, and in which
each horse s original chance is worth little more than the
cost of entry.

It seems that Sainfoin, the Derby winner, had
been out once before this season. The colt walked away
Horn a field of horses in the Esher Stakes, at Epsom
Spring meeting, and so impressed the writer of “Sportiw
Notions,” in the Referee, that he said, “ My latest fancy
is for Sainfoin, who may win the Derby.”

The big horse Tradition was auctioned in Mel-
bourne the other day. Phil. Hey wood, one of the syndi-
cate who parted £3050 for Richmond’s son after his
second to Mentor in the Melbourne Cup, bought back the
burly animal for 900 guineas. Heywood has probably
discovered by' this time that a horse which can nearly' win
a Melbourne Cup when he is beefy, can’t pull off a donkey
race after being made “ thoroughly fit.”

It is perfectly disgusting to see the space the

other good horses.

Steeplechase at Randyvick on Saturday, and again the

Englishmen often speak with wonder of our
steeplechasing, and had some of them witnessed the race
just mentioned on Saturday, it would have made them
hold their breath. Native maintained the lead until
about seven furlongs - from home, when Roasiter di*ew
level, and the pair fairly raced at the jumps as if they
were brush hurdles until the 12st. 31b. told on Native
and he fell back. It was yvithout doubt the most des-
perate piece of riding ever seen on Randyvick.

The “ knowing ” people lose no opportunity in
their endeavours to discover if a horse is going “ to jig.”
They yvill follow the owners all o\'er the course trying to
find out if they' are backing their prads, and they will
examine the heels of both horses and jockeys to see if the
former wear shoes and the latter spurs. ’ However the
signs are not infallible. On Saturday, at Randyvick
Muriel’s jockey started spurless for the Winter Stakes but
she got there all the same.

The just-defunct Plerroit was so little thought
of by the public that he started at 1000 to 15. He was
beaten badly in the St. Leger, and, barring his Derby win
he never did anything on the turf to command attention’
His progeny, hoyvever, have been big winners in the
classic races.

Alf. Jacobs, who ought to be a pretty good
judge, admits that the English are, at least, equal to the
Australian jocks, and likely enough the same may be said
of the respective trainers. It is foolish, therefore, to
blame Dawson for Kirkham’s inglorious display. Had the
colt remained here his running would have been just as bad
Then again, this is a good season with the three-year-olds!
The animals ot one season are much in front of those of
the next. For instance, Bend Or, the Derby winner of
1880, was two stone in front of Sir Bevys, the 1879 hero
and Melton, of ’B5, and Merry Hampton, of ’B7, though
fair performers, were just as much behind Ormonde the
1886 winner.

The captain of the North Melbourne foot-
ball team, having conducted himself very hilariously
at .a recent match, yvas “reprimanded” by the V.F.A.
President. After a Mr. Evans had expressed his “ deep
sorrow,” “ the President,” in reprimanding Houston, said
“it gave him very much pain to have to do so. . . A
reprimand was the lightest punishment the association
could inflict. . .As a man it was painful to him, but
as president of the association he did not flinch from that
duty.” Brave President ! Standing there, with the eye of
Europe upon him, he dared to reprimand, yes, to repri-
mand an unintellectual young person who had conducted
himself after his own dull, stupid lights. Then the as-
sociation all said they were deeply sorry and went forth
to weep bitterly. There must be something peculiarly
manly about football.

defeated by Black Perry, is the one by which he will be
best remembered in Australian boxiana.

John L. Sullivan, they say, is again unsober,
but the rumour is probably unfounded. Sullivan has
always treated the reporters with contempt—both here
and abroad they deserve little better as far as pugilism
goes—and they accordingly slate him. This suits the
people behind the big fellow. Of course the public, misled
by the Press, supposed that Kilrain would beat him, and
fell in the soup. In like manner John L. was abused for
not jumping at the, California Club’s terms, but, like Patti
the big fellow stuck out and got his price.
_ W. Hendley, an old-time cricketer of the days

It is a remarkable fact that though Larry Foley
himself was a noted punisher, his three best pupils in the
several weights divisions—Jackson, Jem Hall and Griffo—
cannot put stingo into their blows. They always lean well
forward as if afraid of body blows, and cannot throw
weight into their deliveries. But as the left is a couple
of seconds faster than the right under ordinary conditions
they anticipate the sloggers who rush in to find them-
selves stopped by blows to which their own attack gives
force. The more swiftly a man fights these, the worse for
himself. The only opponent to meet them is one who
takes things easily and is content to get home an occasional
good blow. This was the secret of Farnan’s success
against Jackson, Hall again—though he won—showed to
poor advantage against Boland, a notoriously slow man
who cannot even use the right, his only good hand.

Unhonoured and unsung there now lives quietly
in Sydney one of the most successful amateur sprinters
who ever ran on English turf. This is James Douglas
Ogilby, of Sydney Museum, who was amateur champion
of Ireland from 1873 to 1877, and during that period
defeated the best men in England, including Shearman,
MacDougall, Powell, E. J. Davies, &c. Ogilby's brother-
in-law, Reginald Miller, of Dublin University, was in his
day a noted performer at ail distances, and was a short
time ago (he may be still) located in one of the public
offices at Brisbane.

A MODEL YOUNG MAN.
A young man went into one of our city banks a
few days ago. The bank manager, a strict tetotal-
ler, meets him. Several letters are handed in,
which he reads. “ I see by the letters that your
habits are good. Did you ever get drunk?” “No
sir.’ “Did you ever attend any temperance
meeting?” “Yes, sir. The one at the Town
hall the other evening.” “Considerable excite-
ment, wasn’t there? Did you do any good?”
* -No, sir ; I was with the temperance gang.”
Did you ever teach in Sunday School ? ” “ Yes,
sir.” “Did you ever indulge in any of that St.
Louis Lager Beer that has been advertised so
much in the papers ? ” “ Yts, sir.” “ A sensible
man, the billet’s yours ! ”

The Coming Fight.
Water versus Whisky.
The Sydney licensed victuallers called a
public meeting in the local Town Hall on Friday
night last, for the purpose of obtaining an expres-
sion of popular opinion on the cold-water party’s
proposal to compulsorily close hotels without com-
pensating their owners. It was the funniest
meeting ever held in Sydney, or any where in the
world we daresay.
* * * *
To begin with, the general public, feeling
that the strong race which has drunk grrgfora
thousand years will continue to drink it for a
thousand years to come, carefully stayed away,
and the body of the hall was simply packed to
suffocation by the temperance bodies, Rechabites,
Good Templars, Sons of Temperance, daughters
of ditto —as many of the cold-water brigade as
could be raked together. On and around the
platform were the licensed victuallers and their
supporters, a sullen and defiant minority. They
saw that their claim had been jumped, that their
own meeting w'as dead against them from the
start, but they had engaged the hall and had
themselves arrived, so they went on with the music.
* * *
There was some difficulty about a chairman.
Nobody seemed anxious for the billet, and a cold-
water humorist in the crowd suggested that they
should “put the billiard-marker in the chair.”
When this trouble was got over, there were no
speakers forthcoming. The chairman stated that
they would be along in a minute, and added that
Mr. Dibbs was to have spoken, but he “ had gone
♦ o Murrurundilater on it was said he had gone to
’ootamundra. Anyhow, he had carefully taken
limself out of the wet. The crowd began to sing
>ut “ Time !” and “ Don’t be afraid !” and after a
vhile Mr, Hunt, licensed victualler, a Crimean
iero by the way, came forward with the first
■esolution, namely, that Local Option without
ompensation was robbery. The publicans, he
said, were a good body of men, theyahvays helped
iveryone that asked them. “Yes, they help
;veryone that has the threepence !” yelled a tem-
oerance fiend. Hunt alleged that they onghtn t
io take away a man's living without compensation,
md he was followed by Mr. F. Bevill, M.A., who
,vas understood to second the motion. The crowd
lidn’t appear to take to him, somehow ; they
started to howl the moment he appeared, and
Kept it up till he sat down. About this time
Gr. H. Reid and “Jack” Want entered the hall,
rmid whoops and cheers. The meeting was
getting more disorderly, and was only carried on
by the courtesy of the temperance organiser, the
remorseless Mr. Clark, who, on promise of being
allowed to move an amendment later on, most
affectively quieted the tumult. How his courtesy
was rewarded by the licensed victuallers will
appear hereafter.
# # *
Concurrently with the arrival of Messrs.
Reid and Want, a person, apparently rather “off
his head,” entered the hall, sat down near the
press table and started to enjoy himself. He was
a fanatic with blazing eyes, half-full of colonial
beer, and lifted by the excitement and the electric
thrill which runs through a crowded and excited
meeting into a state of inspiration border-
ing on frenzy. He acted like the chorus of a
Greek play; he commented on the speakers, he
gave advice, he whooped when the audience
whooped, he cheered on his own account, he was
with difficulty restrained from taking his waist-
coat off when any extra piece of excitement was
going on, and, in fact, he lent to the proceedings
the one touch of completeness which might other-
wise have been wanting. It was a queer scene.
The big hall filled with a clamouring, tumultuous
crowd ; the platform packed with the defiant pub-
licans, who hurled back taunts and gibes at their
opponents ; while near the platform this howling
person raved and mowed and chattered ; and ever
and anon, from the great hall near, came the deep
swelling tones of the organ, “like the sound of a
great Amen,” strong and clear, with its dreamy
music, lifting one’s mind away from the
surging crow'd and their pitiful carnal squabbles.
Mr. Reid said he had only come there to
address both parties, and, in fact, he kept very
cleverly on the rail the whole time. Once he was
interrupted by a temperance man, and made a
rather sharp and stinging retort. The man with
the blazing eyes highly approved. “ Give him a
smack in the snout, George,” he said. “ I’d sooner,
myself, drink gingerbeer than whisky,” said
George Reid. “ Oh, my Gord !” said the crank.
Mr. Reid said that Local Option just now was a
sham —it simply worked for the benefit of the
present holders of licenses. “You want to close
the hotels against the poor man,” said he, “ while
the rich man can drink imported beer. There are
some of you that get sick if you drink beer; this
question does not touch you at all. You say
liquor is bad for a man, but it is only bad when
lie takes too much. Tea is very bad for a man
when he takes too much. Tea ruins your nerves.”
“Tea don’t make a man dance on his wife!”
shrieked the audience. Just here the frenzied one
leaned over and breathed on a man and that man
staggered out of the room with his hand to his
head. Mr. Reid went on and told a couple of old
yarns about children being sent for beer on the sly
on Sunday, but the audience got rather bored and
began to yell out “Time!” and the. orator con-
cluded abruptly; “I can understand your prin-
principles when I see your conduct,” he screamed,
and under cover of this parting shot he retired.
* * #
His place was taken by Mr. “Jack” Want,
Q.C., M.L.A. Jack is a born pugilist, not good
at balancing on a rail. “ I know more about pub-
licans than any man in Sydney,” said he. “ Is it
fair to take aw'ay their living without compensa-
tion? I’d sooner die drinking whisky than live to
drink gingerbeer. Cold water costs you nothing,
and whisky costs me a good deal.” How the tem-
perance brigade whooped ! The lunatic got very
excited, and rose to his feet. “ In about six words
I’ll shut this bloke up,” he said. He was with
difficulty quieted, and then Harry Levien, M.L. A.,
took up the running. The aildience made a good
deal of noise, and he said “ You ve come to ob-
struct freedom of speech, and if you say you
haven’t you’re damned liars”—or words to that
effect. That fetched ’em. They boohooed and
yelled and refused to let him go on till he apolo-
gised, which he did by saying that he had for-
gotten he was not in Parliament. Rough on Par-
liament ! This sort of thing did the publican
party no good, and they settled their own hash by
the tactics which they adopted later on.
# # *
According to the reports of this meeting
in the daily press, a valuable institution which see
saws dreadfully on the liquor question, the temper-
ance party were solely to blame for the
whole concern from first to last, and this,
like most of their reports, conveys an absolutely
wrong impression of what took place. As already
stated, the audience were quietened by Mr.
Clarke, their head ; and Messrs. Crabbe, Perry,
Knapp, &0., who were the leading temperance
people present, actually kept the meeting in hand
and enabled the speeches to be carried on. Of
course, there was a good deal of excitement and
some interruption, but not more than often occurs
at public meetings, Mr. Reid got a very fair
hearing; he ended up abruptly because he never
did like fight, and as oily gammon would not work
and he had the audience dead against him, he
found he was for once not posing as the successful
orator of the meeting, so he went off in a huff.
Mr. Want had a very fair hearing, and his direct
attacks on the Temperance party were evidently
appreciated for their bluntness and courage. Mr.
Levien began by grossly insulting the meeting,
and thoroughly deserved the reception he got in
consequence. Had the publicans been in as large a
majority as the others were, they would have
silenced their opponents altogether. As it was,
by a skilful trick, they made it appear that the
cold-water brigade should move an amendment,
and when “Harry” Levien had finished it was
understood that the Temperance crowd were to be-
gin. They made a move to get on the platform,
but were repulsed by physical force. There was
wild excitement.for a few minutes. A man who
looked like a cheap edition of John the Baptist
tried to get on the platform, and was evidently
heaved off. A bit of a half-hearted rush was made
and some shoving ensued, but no one was hurt.
Then the victuallers put up a man, described as
secretary to a brewery company, apparently to
talk time out. He talked rot and drivel in a kind
of chant, something like the singing bookmaker
who occasionally makes day hideous at suburban
race-meetings. The saints got restive as the farce
went on, but they waited with considerable
patience. “ Let him sing,” said one man, “he is
singing the publicans’ death-song.” At last they
could suffer it no longer. They made another
effort to get on the platform, were shoved off
again, and finally settled on the reporters’ table,
whence Mr. Clarke, mounted on a chair and sur-
rounded by his party, began to address the
audience,
* * *
From this out things were simply.glorious :
the advocates of beer howled wildly on one side
and the cold water set on the other. Not a word
was audible except now and again when in a lull a
fresh charge was made at the platform, but the
publicans kept it, as brave Horatius kept the
gate. Clarke was hoarsely declaiming on the
table : the beer man was shrieking and singing on
the platform—he said something uncomplimentary
about the daughters of temperance once, undone of
them rose up, spread out her ample hand like a
fan, and clawed him down the face—a sample of
the scenes which will occur when women first get
the franchise and proceed to energetically use it.
When you kick a man’s dog, he punches you—
what will happen when a man’s wife is hit in the
course of political discussion ?
# # #
The crank kept ejaculating “Good!”
“ That’s the way*! ” And every now and again
he would throw his head back and swear fluently
and fearfully; as he was sitting between two
of the Daughters of Temperance, it was a bit
rough, and a Temperance young man who sat near
him kept appealing to Mr. George Perry : “ Mr,
Perry, this man’s using ter’ble language ’ere.” As
Perry was about nine seats off he couldn’t do
much, and the Temperance young man seemed
afraid to chuck the loony out except under orders
from thel.O.G.T., but the Daughters of Temper-
ance rose to the occasion, and, after a more than
usually long and profane burst of eloquence, one of
them lifted an umbrella and hit him a whang on
the head that nearly settled him. The chairman
appealed for order, and said that one of their party
had been brutally assaulted ; he referred to the
clawing business, but no one seemed to take any
notice of the crank’s troubles. A wild-eyed
Temperance fanatic made a rush at the platform,
and a licentious victualler caressed him on the
head with a chair, and he retired and sat down
again. Clark was understood to be moving some-
thing or other, full local option without compensa-
tion apparently, and it was carried amid cheers
and counter-cheers, groans, whoops, and cat-calls.
• * *
Two speakers were going all the latter part
of the meeting. The Temperance crowd were on
a table, and every now and again they leaned for-
ward and yelled in the faces of the whiskyites on
the platform, and the whisky brigade yelled back.
Then the Temperance party cheered the Queen on
a cold-water basis, and the opposition cheered her
on a beer footing. Now and again a word or sen-
tence could be caught. “Who is going to com-
pensate us for the loss of our livelihood ?” screamed
the beer advocate. “ Who is going to compensate
the poorhouses and the benevolent asylums for the
folks you’ve driven there?” shouted the enemy.
The riot and uproar were at their height when
Mayor Burdekin appeared, and, speaking firmly
to the crowd, he besought them to go away. Then
some of the Temperance party started to sing, and
before one could realise it they all joined in, and
the whole room rang with the Doxology—
Praise God from Whom all blessings flow.
The beer people looked on in sheer astonishment:
after the tumult and altercation it was a most un-
expected development. They followed it up by
singing “ Auld Lang Syne ” to words of their own,
apparently, and then they cleared out and the
meeting was over'.
# * *
The meeting will, if anything, strengthen
the publicans’ hands, although it looked as if
they put a man up to talk time out and
so baulk the temperance party of their amend-
ment. We don’t like to comment on the
gentleman who took up this task — it is suffi-
cient to say that the temperance folk exhibited a
great deal of patience in listening to such drivel
at all after seeing their leaders chucked off the
platform at a public meeting. The beer party
showed the best generalship throughout; they are
used to little emergencies like chucking men out
of bars, and so forth, while the Temperance people
were a lot of wild-eyed fanatics of very poor phy-
sical development, who lost their heads in the
excitement. They are accustomed to meetings
where nice young men with straggly hair preside,
and the proceedings begin with a hymn and ter-
minate with a collection. This wasn’t that sort of
meeting—not by a whole jugfull.

That of whisky or that of water ? Neither—or
rather both. It is taking the side of whisky and
water, conditioning only that the whisky shall

At Mildura, Victoria, the other day, a woman
was seen to step off the scale weighing 413 pounds,
and she was raised without irrigation. A long,

“Not from irrigation, ’ she replied, “but from

UNIM PEACHABLE TESTIMONU.
Facts are established by testimony. This is so,
not only in laws of business and right, but also in
social life. But while the importance of evidence
is thus everywhere acknowledged, its weight is
purely dependent upon the character of the wit-
nesses. Unimpeachable testimony is therefore what
is wanted. Upon this principle the following
names are presented to the public as being those
of parties who, having experienced or observed
the effects of that great remedy, ST. JACOBS
OIL, accord it their hearty endorsements -
The Right Rev. Bishop Gilmour, Cleveland, Ohio:
“ Excellent for rheumatism and kindred dis
eases. It has benefited me greatly.”
Hon. Ed. Salomon, Ex-Gov. Washington Ter.,
San Francisco, Cal.; “My cure of severe
rheumatism and lameness by St. Jacobs oil
was instantaneous.”
Prof. Tice, the renowned Meteorologist, St. Louis,
Mo. : “Almost instant relief from excruciat-
ing pain.”
Mine; Marie Salvotti, Prima Donna Wilhelm
Concert Troupe ; “ Nothing can compare with
it as a prompt and reliable cure for the ail-
intents named.”
Win. H. Wareing, Esq., Asst. Genl. Supt. Third
Division Mailing and Distributing Dept., New
York Post-office : “ Proved equal to all that is
claimed for the oil, and found efficacious.
Ready-relief for rheumatic complaints.”
Hon. Thomas L. James., Postmaster, New York :
“Referring to Supt. Wareing’s report con-
cerning St, Jacobs oil, ‘I concur.’ ”
Prof. C. G. Duplessis, Manager Chicago, 111.,
Gymnasium : “ Our professionals and ama-
teurs use it in preference to anything we know
of or have ever tried.”
Geo. W. Walling, Esq., Supt. Police, New York
City; “Members of this dept, relieved of
rheumatism by its use.”
Hon. Leonard Swett, the Great Lawyer of the
North-west, Chicago, 111. : “Certainly the
best remedy of the kind I have ever known.”
Captain Paul Boyton, the World-renowned Swim-
mer : “I do not see how I could get along
without St. Jacobs oil.”
M. V. C. Hersom, Esq. (Pinkham and Hersom),
Boston, Mass. : “After spending vainly five
hundred dollars for other remedies, I have no
hesitation in declaring that St. Jacobs oil will
cure neuralgia.”
Stacey Hill, Esq., Mt. Auburn Inclined Plane
Railway, Cincinatti, Ohio : “ Undoubtedly it
is a remarkable medicine.”
IN SH AKESPEARES DAY
When Shakespeare wrote “Let every man be
master of his' own time, watches were only in-
tended for the nobility ; but, in these days, thanks
to American ingenuity and perfect machinery, a
strong’, accurate, and reliable watch, in the shape
of the Waterbury, has been produced at low cost,
which every cm pi oyer and who under-
stands the importance of having good_ time and the
pleasure and convenience of possessing a correct
and trustworthy timepiece can afford to purchase.
The testimony in favour of the Waterbury is over-
whelming, and, like Tennyson’s brook, is ceaseless,
while its reputation is unrivalled by any other
watch in the world.
Mr. R. G. Spear, 97 King-street, Newtown,
writes: “Having had in my possession one of
your watches for two years X have much pleasure
in stating that it has given me every satisfaction,
and would recommend anyone that required a vc-
liable timekeeper to purchase one.”
Mr. John Robertson, of Minim, near Wallsend,
writes: “I have pleasure in stating that the
Waterbury Watch Company has given me every
satisfaction with their watch, which I have had
for a considerable time, and found it to a
splendid timekeeper throughout, in all climates.
Mr. William Helps, Newtown, Sydney, writes :
“ This is to certify that I have carried a Water-
bury Watch for the last three years, and it has
given me every satisfaction us a timekeeper.
Mr. Thomas Regan, writing from Gundare
Station, Coolah, says;—“l have been wearing a
Waterbury for two years and five months, and it
has kept excellent time . Though I have done some
rough riding and drafting in dusty yards, it kept
good time all through ; and I think they are a gift
to all men, poor and rich alike. ”

Observation by the late Baron Dowse.
“ There are so many men walking up and down
this country crying ‘ God save Ireland,’ that they
are making it very difficult for Him to do it.’
Quite correct. But then, before these men started
walking up and down, Ireland was even more in
want of saving than it is to day, and Providence
didn’t seem to be obtrusively busting itself on
behalf of that bleeding country any more than it
is now.
In the old days the gentleman who is now
Sir George limes, Justice of the N.S. Wales
Supreme Court, was no end of a horseman, and
used to ride his own nag in races over the steeple-
chase course on the flat at the back of where Arn-
rliffe station now stands. His father, Captain
Lines, though he had unfortunately lost one leg,
Was also a good rider. When the first elections
took place he was riding on the Racecourse, as
Hyde Park, Sydney, was then called, when the
crowd hedged him into a corner, and to escape
them he had to put his horse at the high fence
which he took in great style. It was at the same
election that the crowd went to a butcher’s shop
standing at what is now Kidman’s Corner, and
commenced to pull the verandah down. One fel-
low had hold of a post assisting to wrench it out,
when a woman came out with a cleaver and
calmly cut off four of his fingers. Next day an
advertisement appeared, saying that if the per-
son who lost four fingers called at such-and-such
an address they would be returned to him,
A talented American reporter hid himself
in a jury-room, and, while lying doubled up under
the table, took elaborate notes of how the verdict
was arrived at. He is now in the penitentiary for
contempt of court, but his paper had a three-column
article showing bow one juryman didn’t know
which was the plaintiff and which was the defen-
dant, and another thought that probably the
person whose head was found lying on the bank of
a river had cut it off and put it there himself, and
a third wanted to bring in a verdict of aggravated
bigamy in the third degree, until he was overruled
by a more enlightened colleague, who thought the
Poi >e had something to do with it, and maintained
the jury should report that that person was guilty
of poison or other nefarious substance. Also,
there were two men who considered that it pro-
bably arose from spontaneous combustion, and
another who woke up suddenly and urged that
some unspecified individual should be compelled to
marry the girl and contribute to the support of the
infant - only, before he could finish, his next
neighbour stood up excitedly and said that the
contractor ought to be prosecuted for not having
the building properly supported at a time of indus-
trial depression, when the trade was straining
itself to place 5-cent cigars within the reach of the
Great Powers of Europe, and that he believed it
arose through the horse running away, which led
to hydrophobia. Finally all the jury came round
to this view of the case, except one, who asserted
it was a plain case of embezzlement and falsifica-
tion of the books, and a compromise was struck to
the effect that the deceased had been overcome by
the act of (rod and had absconded, and that the
remains belonged to somebody else, but who it
was they, the said jury, couldn’t find out without
an index.
The cheerful and gratifying incident which
created so much excitement at the Melbourne
morgue a few weeks ago seems to be pretty well
forgotten, and we observe with regret that the
only valuable lesson which it was calculated to
teach has been utterly thrown away on a miser-
ably unintelligent public. The great social pro-
blem arising out of the hitherto unsuspected
similarity of females in this country requires to
be met by vigorous action of some kind or it will
lead sooner or later to disastrous results, yet not
one 1 of the ghoul-like journals which habitually
live on human i-emains has even called_ attention
to this view of the case. When the important
public corpse which was destined to produce such
surprising results was taken to the morgue even
the ordinary detective, armed only with his own
naked eye, observed that it had two false teeth
and hair of a particular colour, and he also took
note of its clothes and jewellery ; and when Mr.
Louis Lightman called and shed the silent tear of
sensibility over the departed, he recognised her by
the false teeth and the hair and the clothes and
jewellery. The fact that lie claimed to have im-
ported the remains when they were still endowed
with consciousness and locomotion, and to have
lent money to them, and to have bought jewellery
for them, and furnished a house with a view to
entering into matrimony with them, and the cir-
cumstance that the supposed remains wrote stat-
ing, that the money was only a vision and the
jewel ery a delusion and the furnished house a
de-pa ture from the truth, and the further circum-
staii- e that Mr. Lightman produced 12 letters
written by the alleged corpse, and that the
pair got mixed up in an indignant squabble
like two playful cats endeavouring to digest
each other”s tails in the back yard at
night, are merely side issues. Then someone else
came along and identified the deceased by the hair
and the teeth and the jewellery, and the other
fixings, and it was only when the identified one
came along in person that the weeping relatives
broke up and fled in disorder. Yet immediately
after this failure the stolid plain-clothes officer
went out and proved right off, by the agency of
the same fatal hair and the same insidious teeth,
combined with the clothes and the jewellery as
before, that it was another person altogether, and
by this time it became evident that the Victorian
female was so much alike that it was impossible to
tell her apart unless she wrote to the papers and
said it wasn’t her. The constant repetition of a
female with two false teeth and hair exactly the
same is calculated to demoralise any detective
force, and the unfailing similarity of this female
to herself, together with the resemblance of both
of her to the corpse, and the fact that it after-
wards turns out not to be either her or the corpse,
are circumstances that will ultimately land the
police in a lunatic asylum. Of course if she
habitually asserts that she is not the corpse the
public wants to know who she is, and apparently
she is so much alike that she doesn’t know
herself, for the man she was engaged to
states that she was the female he furnished a
house for, and she says she isn’t which suggests
that he really furnished the house for someone
p'se who was so much like her that he didn’t re-
cognise the difference. Whether the other person
was aware of the mistake, or whether she mistook
him for some other individual altogether at the
time he furnished the house, and whether he lent
the sum of £l5 to either of them, or to a third
party who looked like both of them but was still
quite distinct from the other two, is a question
that is too large to enter into. The one solid fact
amid a wilderness of conjecture is that the female
of the human species is so much alike in Victoria
as to amount to a public danger, and any man who
lends £l5 to her would do well to paint a brief
memorandum of the fact on her in the presence of
a reliable witness, in order to make reasonably
certain that he hasn’t advanced the money to a
complete stranger whom he never saw before.
Also, he had better make dead-sure that he can
identify the reliable witness when he wants him
again, and he would also do well to take all neces-
sary steps to find out who he is himself before he
commits himself, lest he should be lending some
one else’s money to some one else’s girl, and then
when she is found dead, and is suspected of being
1G different individuals aird it is proved that she
is eight of them with an off-chance that she is the
cither eight as well, he may find himself in a serious
difficulty.

Macmorton’s Mare.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Four years or so ago the death was an-
nounced of a gentleman whose estate was sworn
at a little less than £lOO,OOO, of which, it was
stated, he made a very large proportion by fortu-
nate investments in miningrstook. Not very many
people knew the circumstances under which he
drifted into the wealth-making sphere; the present
writer believes himself to be the only person
acquainted with the story in its strictly correct
form.
* * *
Ten years ago, Macmorton—that wasn’t his
name, but it will do for the present purpose—was
manager of an up-country branch of the Consoli-
dated Bank of Oceana, Limited. The township—
call it Callaba—was situated on the bank of a
river which was sufficiently wide and deep to ren-
der a punt necessary to convey vehicles and horses
to the other side. A few miles distant across the
river was the town (not township, mind, it was far
too important for that designation) of Yowlahmine.
Youlahmine had three banks, and a railway, and
gas, and cabs, all of which luxuries were unknown
at Callaba, and consequently the inhabitants of
the town looked upon the “township” as a very
one-horse sort of a place. But when the extension
of the railway to Callaba was sanctioned and the
building of the line was actually begun, Callaba
began to look quite lively, and the business at the
local bank increased so much that a junior clerk
was appointed to assist the manager. I was that
clerk. Now you will understand how I know so
much about what followed.
# # #
Macmorton, the manager, was frequently
away, interviewing prospective customers, “put-
ting the screw ” on long-winded debtors, and so
on. In his absence I acquired much information
with regard to his private business affairs. For he
was a most careless man, was Macmorton, and
used to leave his correspondence lying around
quite promiscuously, just as if a junior clerk had
no curiosity. Well, it wasn’t long before I dis-
covered one thing about the “boss,” and that was
that he was very hard pushed for money. He had
been speculating largely—always was a great man
for speculation— in land, in mines, and on horse-
races. And he had come to grief, more or less,
over each, but especially over his land-purchases.
You see, he had bought up a lot of land along the
proposed railway-route, intending to have a land-
boom when the line was constructed. But the
route was changed, his allotments became nearly
worthless, and the “boom” did not eventuate.
Thus it came about that Macmorton would have to
find the sum of one thousand pounds to appease
one particularly determined creditor, or declare
himself a “broker.”
# * *
About this time a weekly or fortnightly
visit to Yowlahmine by the Callaba manager was
necessary for exchange purposes. The railway
contractors were customers of the Royal Bank at
Yowlahmine, and paid their men in notes of that
institution. As the works were in progress just
at our doors, a very large proportion of these notes
found their way, in the usual course of business,
into our hands. Indeed, there used to be an
average of £lOOO of Royal notes in our possession
a few days after the fortnightly pay Saturday.
These were taken by one of us to the Yowlahmine
branch of the Royal, and we gob in return their
draft on their head-office for the amount, less any
°f our notes they happened to have. But at this
time we always had a large excess of theirs, on
account of the railway men’s wages. We had no
stated period for keeping the Royal notes, bub
just allowed them to accumulate until there were
enough of them to make it worth while to under-
take the journey. Sometimes Macmorton took
them, sometimes he sent me,
* * #
Well, the time came when we held about
£3O OO worth of Royal notes, and Macmorton pro-
pared to take them to Yowlahmino. I took a note
°f the numbers and amounts. Macmorton packed
them in his despatch-bag, lint it under the seat of
his buggy, and drove off to the punt. How it
happened no one could ever say, for none saw it ;
but when the punt was in the middle of the
stream the ferryman heard a shout and a splash,
and, looking round from the forward part of the
punt, where he was pulling the cable, he saw the
banker’s mare over the side in the water, and a
second later overboard went the buggy, and, as
the ferryman graphically expressed it, the “ whole
fraternity goes to the bottom !”

tressed over the affair, but it struck me very
forcibl on several occasions that Macmorton
wasn> / half so sorry as he tried to make out. Of
. • . , „ .
course theie WciB a Dl2* stu tit our hGciJ ollico over
the j and an insp n ector was senfc up to inquire
bito it. But he could discover nothing more than
was generally known, for the only witness of, the
disaster was Macmorton himself. Then they sent up
a diver, in spite of the assertions of thewaterside au-
thorities of Callaba that the current of their river
was so violent that it was quite ridiculous to suppose
there was the least chance of ever getting back the
bag of notes from its depth—-unless, indeed, it
hadn’t been washed out of the buggy; but that was
very unlikely. The diver spent about a week in
sub-aqueous research, judiciously diversified by
visits to all the pubs., and discovered the buggy
and the dead mare not far from where they went
down, but there was no bag. This confirmed the
pet theory of the residents about the peculiar
ferocity and vigour of the under-current of their
stream, and gratified them accordingly. The diver
was made more of a hero than ever, and was in a
chronic state of “muzziness” without the least
effort or expense on his own part,
# * #
mu nn u , , . , ,
~ be Callaba yokels had never lie fore feasted
le l r e '’ es on 811 9 1 f real live diver, and
their open-mouthed admiration of this amphibious
hero was quite interesting. 1 hey were altogether
too dense, likewise, to notice that the diver s zeal
slackened perceptibly, and his goings-nnder became
much less frequent after a long interview he had
one day with Macmorton in the back parlor of the
pub. But /noticed it. They thought that Mac-
morton was giving instructions as to the best way
to go to work to recover the lost cash, and pro-
bably offering huge bribes to the diver to stimulate
him to carry his mission out successfully. But
anyhow, the result was that the diver went under
water a few more times, studied the interiors of the
various,.pubs, a great many times, and finally
earnedi-the good opinion of the water authorities by
admitting that their ideas were undoubtedly cor
rect. And when at last the toiler of the river an-
nounced that he “guv it up as a bad job,” and
that it was his firm opinion that them there notes
wouldn’t never be seen in this world again, the
folks were tremendously gratified that their pet
theory had been proved correct.
* * *
As for myself, I held my tongue and
kept my eyes open. After expounding a
text from Corinthians to my Sunday - school
class a fortnight after the departure of the
diver, I was inspired to visit the stable-loft during
Mr. Maemorton’s absence, and there, buried deep-
down among the maize in the corn-bin, I dis-
covered the sum of £1837 in Royal Bank notes,
Perhaps the undercurrent had washed them up
there. On his return, just before dinner-time,
that Sabbath evening Mr. Macmorton, I noticed,
also visited the stable. His face at the hotel-
table was as long as a horse’s, and his appetite had
deserted him. He stared hard at me, but I flatter
myself that in my countenance he could see
nothing but the light of true religion.'
A month later, Mr. Macmorton became insol-
vent, and resigned the managership of the bank.
For some reason or other, his bearing towards me
in the latter days of our association was most
chilly and unsympathetic. Be went to Sydney,
became a stock-jobber, allied himself to many
syndicates, and rode successful]y on the crest of
the land boom and afterwards of the silver-boom.
Yet I never envied him, up to the day he died
of typhoid fever, contracted at a Melbourne hotel.
My £1837 has now grown into £ll,OOO under the
stimulative auspices of 60 per cent.

Judging from the latest available reports
~ ■* , • • i i ■ , ,
the bushranging industry is not by any means
what it used to be. Twenty or twenty-five years
ago a bushranger, in anything like a large way of
business, had to hire a trained accountant to
audit the plunder, and it was not at all an unconr
, ru-i-ji .. i
mon circumstance for him to declare two dividends
in the course of a week ; but now all that is
changed, and the small retail assassin of the pre-
sent day is merely a broken-down object of scorn
with a bad cold, caught thr ugh sitting for 18
consecutive hours under a hedge while waiting for
a man who was supposed to have eighteenpence
about him and who never turned up. What ap-
pears to be the la t of the tribe has lately retired
from business in Western Australia, and has
taken to agriculture on a small scale in the hope
that he may ultimately make up his past losses,
He was an active and vigorous freebooter, but on
the first day of his nefarious career he rode 22
mites and only met one man, whom he robbed of
two sixpences, an old knife, and a plug of loath-
some tobacco. He spent that night in a paddock,
and did not dare to light a fire lest justice might
be on his track; also it rained inces-
santly, and he got an attack of rheuma-
tism, and his horse trod on him during the night,
Next morning he managed to raise a breakfast at
the cost of eighteenpence, and late in the after-
noon he was compelled to almost kill a belated
canvasser before he could wrest from him a picture
representing a plain, red-headed girl washing her
feet in a river. He turned the canvasser upside
down and shook him, but nothing fell out, so he
departed with his unsaleable work of art, and for
want of a market ultimately threw it into a water-
hole. About ten o’clock the same night he forced
another lone traveller under pain of death to sur-
render another plug of tobacco, a green apple, and
a foreign nickel coin. His horse went astray
before morning, and the third day he wore his legs
off right up to his stomach trudging along a fearful
road, and met nobody at all, and found nothing
that he could beg or borrow or confiscate ; and he
spent that night repenting under a sodden tree,
while the rain dropped with a maddening persist-
ency on the back of his neck and trickled down
his spine. Towards morning, however, he heard
footsteps coming, along the road, and his spirits
rose, but when he told the traveller to stand and
deliver, that person paid no attention, but walked
right on, and then the freebooter told him that his
gore would be upon his own cranium and fired —at
least, he attempted to fire, but his gun was so
badly soaked that it wouldn’t go off. It took him
six hours to get the weapon in working order
again, and while it was still under repair a swags-
man took advantage of his defenceless condition
and borrowed all his tobacco. Also, sixteen other
people went try in succession, but the instant the
gun was once more in a shooting condition the
procession stopped, and Hot a single individual
who could be robbed of a cent was visible any-
where on the horizon. Long after dark he dis-
covered a selector's shanty in the distance, but by
this time he was too hopelessly broken down to
attempt violence, so he simply crawled into a sort
of barn and went to sleep. By-and-bye he began
to dream, and presently a seraphic vision unrolled
itself before him, and he imagined that, instead of
being a poor, degraded marauder, making war
upon society for one plug of tobacco a
week, he was living in an earthly Paradise, where
he had a billet to drag a cart of dirt uphill
for twelve hours a day at a salary of threepence an
hour, and just as he was asking himself if this
could be real he became aware that a good-sized
animal was trotting restlessly round the barn and
treading on him every time it passed. He sat up
to expostulate, and the animal became scared and
galloped harder, and every time it rushed over
its claws seemed to get hitched in his hair, and it
took a portion of that covering along with it.
Then he clutched at it, but it gave a scream, and
hit out with about 180 weighty extremities at once,
and there Were claws in every one of them ; si the
unhappy pirate concluded that he had tried to
grasp a whole ostrich farm, and lay still lest he
should be eaten alive. Sometimes the bird stopped
and stood on him, but generally it only kicked
him with both feet, and then started off on a fresh
gallop. And so the miserable night passed away,
and at length daylight came and revealed to the
man of blood that he had been insulted for
eight long hours by one solitary Cochin-
China rooster without a tail, and he felt so
badly broken up by this discovery that when the
selector found him and offered him a job to work
seven days in the week in exchange for board and
lodging, he accepted the situation unanimously.
He now trusts by industry and strict attention to
business that he may succeed in retaining this
lucrative appointment all through the winter, and
possibly in the spring he may find an opportunity
to sell his gun for a sum that will keep him in
food while he walks to the nearest town, 150 miles
away, and looks for a situation at a low salary in
a lime-kiln. But, anyhow, he states that he has
permanently retired from the bushranging in-
dustry, the same being a precarious occupation, in
the pursuit of which a man’s constitution is apt to
be undermined through exposure to draughts and
other climatic influences.

The Story of the Big Pearl.
(FOR T HE BULLETIN.)
Chapter I.
Lazily riding at anchor, in company with
some half-dozen others, is a small lugger, one of a
pearling fleet. It is almost a dead calm, and on the
northern horizon there is a hazy suspicion of land,
the coast of New Guinea. The midday spell is
drawing to a close, and the coloured crew are
rousing themselves from their short nap under the
awning stretched amidships. In the cabin, per-
meated, as is all the rest of the Vessel, by an
ancient and fishlike smell, a couple of Malays are
in earnest conference ; Abdrahim, the diver, and
Eyed, his tender. In the bronzed hand of the
former lies a lustrous and beautiful pearl ; a globe
of soft moonlight, such a pearl as is found but
once in two centuries,. Both men know that it is
of priceless value, and are eagerly gloating over
it, discussing, meanwhile, the best means of dis-
posing of their find to the greatest possible advan-
tage. _ Presently Abdrahim wraps up the treasure
in a piece of rag and places it in his box, which he
locks ; then, followed by Eyed, goes on deck attd
proceeds to array himself itt his diving-gear. This
completed, he is helped oveV the side and stands
bn the wooden rung of the short ladder, with his
head and shoulders above the surface of the water
waiting While Eyed and a Kanaka put on the
helmet and screw in the mouthpiece. Take your
last look at the bright sunlight, and inhale your
last breath of the fresh Sea-breeze, A bdrahim, for
that pure; flawless gem has done its work. Eyed
Will not share with you the proceeds of the spoil—
you now go to your death.
The helmeted head disappears beneath the,Un-
ruffled surface of the sea and Eyed takes tils place
at the pump. The nondescript crew pay little
heed to his actions ; again and again the life-line
buivetS; but Eyed is lost in a pleasant dream of
the future in which he wonders at the surpassing
folly of his countryman in trusting his life in his
hands just after showing him the glorious pearl
hidden away in the cabin. Abdrahim, he httoWs
well, is suffocating below the lugger’s keel, but
the Malay’s swarthy features “are calm’ and
emotionless Until he suddenly calls hastily to the
Others, and they drag to the surface the now life-
less form of the diver. An accident, of course-
something must have gone wrong with the pump,
he rapidly explains to the,men as they divest thb
corpse of the dress, and laying it on the deck
cover it with a spare sail. Towards evening a
breeze springs up and the lugger, With the dead
Malay on board, steers for Thursday Island
* * ~ §
The little tbwhship on the island is fast
asleep; bight bells have been struck on board the
and A. steamer at anchor in the stream, and
the last sound of human revelry has died away.
Near an old boatshed in whispered COtivetsatioii
stand Eyed and & Ghitiafflaih The Malay is
excited afid hkger, the Chinaman apathetic, with a
bUrirtlhg assumption of indifference. The big pearl
is being extolled on one side and depreciated on the
other. Subtle Hi Long is assuring Syed that he has
quite over-estimated the worth of his find, and the
Malay is vehemently asserting its wonderful
value. They part, after long dispute, Hi Long
calm and confident, Syed angry and Upset. He
ooils up in his blankets Under the Aid boat-shed,
and after au .hour Of two of troubled tossing falls
iilto a deep slumber that lasts until long after sun-
Hse> When he awakes he sits up, fumbles
Underneath the bundle that serves him for a
pillow, and draws out a common red silk handker-
chief with a knot tied in one corner; glancing
apprehensively around he unties the knot to feast
his gaze upon his treasure; With a yell he Springs
Up, Ills eyes ablaze With fury and despair, for the
big pearl is gone. He has been robbed daring his
late sleep; A mist Of blood swims before his eyes
and blots OUt all his dreams of wealth. Blood—
that is what he wants, and he draws his knife arid
rushes throqgh the door out on to the beach, no
longer a man but a beast of prey, seeking to glut
his raging thirst for vengeance on the first object
crossing his path. A group of men are right in
his, way, and almost before they are aware of it,
he is amongst them striking and stabbing right
and left, seeing before him nothing but a crowd of
grinning Chinese taunting him with the loss of his
fortune. Two are knifed before they can recover
from their surprise—one of the remainder, a
gigantic kanaka, has fortunately an axe in his
hand, and before the madman can stab again
he is cut down. He rises once more with the
blood streaming down his face and rushes out on
the boat-jetty leaving a ruby track on the rough
stones. With one last wild stab at the phantom
fleeing before him, he plunges into the sea and
Syed has gone to reckon with the ghost of the
murdered Abdrahim.
The E. and A. steamer going south that morning
has an additional passenger forwards, in the per-
son of Hi Long, who finds he has urgent business
which compels him to leave Thursday Island im-
mediately.
Chapter 11.
‘ ‘ And what do you think the value of it is ?”
The question was asked by a young man, of an
elderly one, in a small office in Lohdoti.
“ The Value; ttiy dekt boy, is whatever can be
£bfc for it, Getns, as you are aware, can be of such
Valffe as to be almost valueless, because nobody
can be found wealthy enough to afford to purchase
them. The pearl, fabulously supposed to have
been dissolved by Cleopatra, was estimated in
modern money at £BO,OOO. This we may put down
as the romance of history, Cleopatra, a keeh
Woman of the world, had fat to much sense to com-
hllt stioh folly, and £BO,OOO had far more purchas-
ing power then than it has now. However, this is
a most rare and valuable pearl; it is absolutely
flawless, and I may venture to say that it is worth
as much money as you would, make in twenty
years’ work. Now what is the story about it ?”
“ I came home from Singapore, as you know, by
way of Australia. At Thursday Island we took
on a few more Chinese passengers; but before
reaching Cooktown one of these committed suicide
by jumping overboard—it seems he had been gam-
bling and lost all his money. When we got to
Cooktown one of the Chinese came to me and
offered me this pearl for sale. He knew it was
valuable, but had no idea that it was anything ont
of the common. It seems that he won it from the
man who committed suicide, who had got it at
Thursday Island —stolen it, I suppose; anyhow, the
loss of it drove him mad, and he went overboard.
To make a long story short, I gave the fellow fifty
pounds for it, and you are the first who has seen it
since I bought it.”
The elderly man, a well-known and wealthy
dealer in precious stones, looked thoughtful for a
moment. “ Leave it with me for a day or two,
Tom,” he said to his nephew, “and I’ll do the
best I can with it. I know an Indian prince who’s
in London just now, and if I can’t sell it, I may be
able to exchange it for more marketable stones. ”
“To tell you the truth, uncle,” returned Tom.
“ I shall be very glad to handle the cash, so don’t
put too astounding a price on it.”
His uncle smiled as he bade his nephew good
day. “Tom, my boy, don’t you think I’m old
enough to understand my business by this time?
Come to dinner to-morrow and hear how I’ve got
on.”
* * *
The jewel-merchant was sitting in his
office next day ; opposite to him was a swarthy-
faced, well-dressed man of middle age who Was
gazing admiringly at the big pearl.
“I should like to know the story of this pearl
before your nephew bought it,” he said in perfectly
good English.
“In all probability the Chinamah Who Jumped
overboard, bought it for a Song from a diver who
had secreted it. They cannot well sell them
openly, so they have to take what they can get.
Of course, in the first place, it must have been
stolen, but it would be impossible to place the
right owner now.”
“ I am quite convinced that your nephew’s title
to it is good,” replied the prince, “or he would
never have reached home,”
“One of your Eastern fables?” said the merchant
with a slight smile.
“No fable,” returned the Indian ; “ the history
of my country and my own family traditions prove
it. A precious stone gained by fraud or bloodshed
invariably brings ruin on the culprit.”
“That reminds me that on the morning my
nephew left Thursday Island, where the Chinaman
who committed suicide came on board, one of the
Malays engaged in the pearl-fishery ran amok,
seriously wounded two men and jumped into the
sea.”
“In all probability he Was the mail who first
found it; but I WOn’t argue with you, for your
British common-sense is, I well know, not to be
convinced. Will you wait on me to-morrow and
we will come to terms about this piece of a diseased
oyster.”
“I will, prince. When do you intend starting
once more on your travels ?”
NOT CURRENCY.
HE: “I’M GOIN’ TO SHOUT FOR THE BOY-I ’POSE MY NAME’S GOOD?”
MR. BUNG: “WELL, YOU SEE, IT AIN’T CASH.”
“In a few days. lam going right round the
world by Australia. lam on the look-out for a
good secretary ; do you know of one ?” The
merchant shook his head. “I will advertise,”
said his visitor as he left the room.
Chapter 111.
Australia once more. The Indian prince
had purchased the big pearl, had obtained another
treasure in the shape of a perfect secretary, and
was now in Melbourne at the close of the southern
summer. The secretary had been selected out of
many applicants, and, m all respects, had proved
himself fitted for the position.
It is nearly midnight. In a room where evi-
dently a supper-party has just been held are
M'Auliffe, the secretary, and a woman of about
five-and-twenty. She is as faultless in face and
figure as the great pearl itself : but it is a
purely animal beauty. Her eyes have the hard,
fierce light of a bird of prey, but to him they are
as soft as the dove’s.
“ Is your mind made up at last ?” she says.
“It is. Love and fortune with you ;is it likely
I should hesitate.”
“I knew I was right, after all; when that
empty-headed Compton was running you down I
told him what I thought of you.”
“ You did undertake my defence then ? What
did the fool say of me?”
“ That you were only fit to be the servant of a
nigger.”
The young fellow ground his teeth and turned
red and then pale as she repeated the brutal
taunt.
“ I will be even with him before we leave here,”
he muttered.
“Now say good night,” went on Delilah, laying
a firm warm hand on his shoulder. “ To-morrow
we will make our final arrangements to meet in
Brisbane.”
Shortly afterwards M'Auliffe left the place and
hastened to his own home in the house occupied
by the prince. His employer was still up, writing
in a small room that served as an office.
The secretary looked in and the prince beckoned
to him. “Been out to supper?” he asked in a
kindly tone.
M'Auliffe said yes and sat down.
“I am going to have a few friends to dinner
to-morrow,” went on his employer, “ and amongst
them is General Ashdown, who was resident in
the province some years am To-morrow I want,
you to come down with me to the bank and take
charge of some jeWela 1 have there; he is a great
connoisseur, and I especially want to show him the
big pearl.”
After some more conversation on the subject
they separated for the night, and the secretary
went to bad to lie awake thinking of the future.
Never strong-minded, he had been led on to
contemplate robbery, but he never anticipated
auch a ohanoe as awaited him on the morrow. He
had intended to forge the prince’s name for some
£3OOO, and make off with whatever valuables he
could lay hands on, taking with him as a com-
panion the woman he had left that night, No\V the
great pearl that he had heard valued at from forty
to fifty thousand pounds was put in his reach, and
he would indeed be only fit to be “a nigger’s ser-
vant ” if he let slip such a chance.
The dinner-hour had arrived ; M'Auliffe had
been entrusted with the big pearl and a few stones
more rare than intrinsically valuable. He had
pleaded headache as an excuse front being present
at dinner, and the prince now sent a servant to his
room to ask him to bring down the pearl for
inspection.
He was not there, he was not in the house.
The one and truthful conclusion was jumped at
by everybody. He had absconded with the
valuables.
The prince took it with Oriental stoicism
“ Poor fool! ”he said more to himself than to the
company.
“ He’ll never be able to get rid of it,” said
General Ashdown, thinking he referred to the
certainty of detection if he offered the pearl for
sale.
“No,” replied the Indian; “it will get rid of
him, though. That fellow has signed his own
death-warrant. Wait, General, and you will see.”
The escape was well managed, the woman had
planned the details and not a clue was obtained as
to the whereabouts of the thief.
• • • •
A fortnight elapsed when the police received a
telegram from Townsville, Queensland,, stating
that M'Auliffe had been seen and recognised on
the B. and I. steamer Quetta. The prince and
the General were together when the news was
communicated to the former. He shrugged his
shoulders. “I am glad I’m not on board,” he
said to his friend. “ Orders to detain the absconder
were wired to the last port of call at Thursday
Island.”
M'Auliffe and his so-called wife were not
amongst those saved from the wreck of the Quetta.
So with that ill-fated steamer sank the great pearl
and its latest possessors.

THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only paper which has a con
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy,
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived diiectly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education,
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces- —
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
Th£ Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its ftrtiatb
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in Which Australian capitalists
have iihavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
Weekly-press prior to £nd immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name, t'llfey are doty all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form —printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its iudeption.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress : it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege—the direct cause of
half the misery which now afflicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised. The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
ntelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact —easily ascertainable from any postal
official—that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies." ...
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of - original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

I\TEW SOUTH WALES FLOODS RELIEF
IS FUND.
The Central Committee of the New South Wales
Floods Relief Fund, having relieved cases of tem-
porary distress in Sydney, and having now agreed
on the nature of the losses for which compensation
is to be given, are desirous that the subscribed
funds should be distributed as speedily as possible
amongst the sufferers.
With this object in view, the Central Committee
respectfully asks Magistrates or other residents in
all the flooded districts of New South Wales to
have Committees appointed to inquire into the
losses sustained; and where no Committee has
been appointed, the Central Committee requests
Police and other Magistrates to kindly undertake
this duty ; and on their notifying their acceptance
of the position, printed forms for collecting in-
formation as to losses sustained will be imme-
diately forwarded.
In the event of claimants being unable’ (from
illness, distance or any spe ial cause) to present
their claims to the local Committees or Magis-
trates, they may forward such claims direct to the
Central Committee in Sydney.
