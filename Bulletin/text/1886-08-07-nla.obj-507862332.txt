SATURDAY, AUGUST 7, 1886.
Once again the agreement between Aus-
tralian shipowners and their employees is
under review. A crisis has coffle which may
possibly lead to battles, fierce as those of
past years, and even more extensive in range
and disastrous in action; or, on the other
hand, may induce masters and men to Join
their strength for the overthrow of a foreign
opponent. In the manner of its inception
this crisis is remarkable and deeply signi-
ficant. Formerly Capital was accustomed
to announce its dissatisfaction with the
existing conditions of agreement, by posting
a brief notice, which was an ultimatum ; and
When Labour was discontented, the contract
With the employers was broken with but
Scant ceremony and small consideration.
The arrogance of the parties precipitated,
their mutual hatred and distrust protracted
the strife* which in its continuance spread
disaster over the Continent. Arbitration
lent its assistance in bringing about a re-
conciliation* but this species of mediation
Was effectual only when the necessities of
one or other of the parties were such as to
force them to a settlement, which was
rather a surrender than an agreement.
Masters and men regarded each other as
Stubborn and remorseless enemies, and as
sUch they fought. Far different is their pre-
sent attitude. The Secretary of the Steam-
ship Owners’ 1 Association introduces the
question in a letter, which is professedly an
Invitation to confer, not a challenge to fight.
Therein it is shown that foreign ships, heavily
subsidised, and cheaply manned, are obtain-
ing a large share of the intercolonial trade,
thereby reducing the profits earned by
locally owned ships to the lowest possible
figure. No reasonable objection can be
taken to the terms of this communication.
Viewed from the masters’ standpoint, it is a
marvel of moderation. Figures are quoted
to prove that the five foreign companies
which are interfering so injuriously with
the intercolonial trade receive a total sub-
sidy of £423,000, and that one company—the
Peninsular and Oriental—buys its labour
for an average of than one-sixth the
amount paid to Australian crews. It is also
affirmed that expenses for repairs and pro-
visions are much less in Europe than in Aus-
tralia, a fact which gives to the foreign
companies another distinct advantage in
the competition for intercolonial trade.
Taking all these facts into consideration,
the Associated Steamship Owners “propose
to reduce ” the wages of the members of the
crews by about £1 per month all round.
• o ■
The Federated Seamen are not particu-
larly anxious to explain away the facts
alleged; their energies are concentrated
rather upon the proposal to make the wage-
earners subscribe at the rate of £1 a month
-per man to make dividends for the share-
‘holders. But they may well take a prelimi-
nary objection to accepting without further
proof, the assertion that capital is not re-
ceiving its due return. The letter is nicely
’timed to accompany the half-yearly state-
ment of the A.S.N. Company, which shows
a net profit of £350 only, a result that must
be in part due to the loss of the Ly-ee-Moon
in May last. It may be fairly inferred that
the Company do not consider that a vessel
of similar value will be lost every half-year,
nor oan it be taken for granted that the
management of their affairs is consistent
'with the true principles of economy. If the
A.S.N. Company are unfortunate enough to
continue to lose two valuable steamers per
year, or if their business is so badly managed
that large profits cannot be made, it is too
much to expect that the seamen and trim-
mers shall be levied upon to pay up the loss
for which they are in no way responsible.
While one company is actually losing on its
operation, another one in the same trade
may be making enormous profits. To make
the seamen of both companies forego a part
of their wage in order that shareholders
may fatfen would be injustice approximat-
ing to robbery.
♦ • •
This objection will, however, be of small
moment in comparison with the proposal to
reduce wages. The proposition itself will
suggest one inference or corollary to the
men and a totally different one to the
masters. To the latter its adoption would
THE LATE DR. RUDOLF SCHUETTE.
seem to signify the willingness of Aus-
tralian seamen to submit to further reduc-
tions, at a future time, if competition with
Lascar, Chinese, and nigger-manned steamers
should again imperil the dividends of share-
holders of local companies. But this is
exactly what the Unions have laboured to
prevent. If the local companies employ
niggers, they must pay them the wages
which an Australian would accept. None
other than Union men may be employed on
such vessels, and the standard wage must
ba strictly maintained. To submit to the
levy for such reasons as the masters allege
would be a renunciation of all Union princi-
ples. In writing thus, we presume upon the
fairness of the wage which the men now re-
ceive. Admitting that it is higher than that
paid in any other part of the world, the fact
still remains that it is not unduly high when
compared with the Australian rates for
other manual labour. The sum that a
serang-driven Lascar may receive cannot be
taken as an index of the amount sufficient
to keep an Australian seaman and his
family, nor can it be regarded as the equiva-
lent of his labour. To justify the reduction
on such grounds is utterly irrational. As
well might the masters ask local provision
merchants t} abate 25 per cent, of their
prices because the merchants who supply
the P. and O. Company can sell at the other
side of the world at such a rate.
a « ■
The inference drawn by the men from
this demand upon their pockets for the
benefit of the shareholders naturally will
be that they are also entitled to the profits
above a certain amount paid as dividend to
shareholders when profits are largely in-
creased. Mere servants are not dependent
for the rate of their pay upon the record of
their masters’ balance-sheet. Whether
their labour is productive of large profit or
no the remuneration of a servant is un-
changed. But in this present instance the
seamen are called upon to accept a less re-
turn because their labour produces so small
a profit; therefore being losers by the
masters’ or companies’ loss they should also
profit by their subsequent increase of gain.
If the owners could be induced to confirm
this view the men might possibly be induced
to forego a part of their pay for the pros-
pect of a future bonus. Ultimately some
such system of industrial co-operation must
be adopted. Directly or indirectly the men
must in the future benefit by the result of
their own labours. Indirect co-operation of
the kind suggested may long delay the adop-*
tion of a complete system of steamship man ■
agement on direct co-operative lines, but iir
the end the latter must come. Nor canf
it be doubted that the high intelligence
and business tact necessary for the'
working of so succesful and enduring an
organisation as the Federated Seamen's
Union would go far to ensure theprosperity
of a trading company of which every em -
ployee would be a shareholder. It oan
hardly be thought that the owners in send-
ing round the hat for the eleemosynary £1 a
month intend to concede the claim which
the men would rightly believe to be in all
Justice dependent upon the demand; but
unless such claim is allowed, and strongly
guaranteed, we have a suspicion amounting
to certainty that the hat will return empty
as it started, and perhaps somewhat dilapi-
dated, and even mutilated. The seamen
now hold their position securely ; it would
be worse than folly for them to surrender
it without sufficient guarantee for the ad-
vantages of so doing.
♦ * ♦
At the time of writing, there does not
seem to be much prospect that any such
give-and-take arrangement will be adopted.
The Stewards’ and Cooks’ Union deals with
the matter in a generous spirit, and is in-
clined to make a sacrifice in order to
obtain future benefits* but the seamen are
more disposed to take other measures for
increasing the profits at present accruing to
the shareholders of the local steam com-
panies. One evident method of attaining
such fi result is by restricting the number of
competitors for the intercolonial trade so
far as to present vessels other than Auati a-
lian from carrying intercolonial goods ot
passengers. That this ban be done is a
matter of reasonable certainty. Already, in
the case of the trade on the North-eastern
coast of Australia, the seamen have mea-
sured their strength against that of foreign
ship-owners and have succeeded in prevent-?
ing them from appearing as rivals to eolo J
nial companies. The mail-steamers, ancf
those loaded with tea cargoes, do not now,
venture to do any coast trade between
Queensland ports, and there is little doubt
that the same conditions could be imposed
upon steamers with regard to the trade of
New South Wales, Victoria, and South Aus-
tralia. The Federated Seamen cannot abso-
lutely prohibit the P. and O. and other
foreign boats from engaging in Australian
trade, but they can make it very unprofit-
able for them to do so, and this in practice
amounts to exactly the same thing. Whether
they consider the demand of the seamen a
just one or not, we are disposed to think
that the foreign owners would be unwilling
to submit to the inevitable humiliation
resultant upon a determination to resist
such a demand when made.
• • •
The right of the men to veto such foreign
competition if they are able to do so, is in-f
disputable. Self-preservation is a valid plea*
whenever methods, in themselves fair and
legal, are employed. There can be no middle
course in such a question as this. If Aus-
tralian seamen are to be forced to compete
with the Lascars who man the P. and O.
vessels, there is no reason why they should,
not be brought into competition with
Lascars on the A.S.N. Company’s boats. If,
Lascars are to reduce by their competition
the wages of European seamen, it matters
nothing in point of principle whether they
work on board a foreign or locally owned
vessel. The same reasons which Justified the"
expulsion of Chinese from the A.S.N. boats’,
will also be capable of supporting the seamen
in their objection to allowing Chinese and
Lascars to compete with them in other
vessels for the Australian trade. In such a

The Progress of Proteefcioa.
Wit* one voice the Freetrade dailies of Sydney
have vented their pious indignation against the
Protectionists who howled down the exponents
•f an opposite creed at the Protestant Hall. Abuse
without measure has been heaped upon the
"rabble” who refused to be guided by "the
British spirit of fair-play.” No term within the
Vocabulary of “respectable” language Is too severe
to be used in condemnation. And these papers
Should have large experience of the unfairness of
such tactics, for the one conspicuous feature of
Sydney dally Journalism all through the agi-
tation culminating in the recent overthrow of
the Free-trade idol, has been the suppres-
sion of everything in favour of Protection.
The excited electors who howled at the
most sincere and able of the Freetrade cham-
pions Mr. B. R. Wise, at the recent meeting, only
Imitated by so doing the conspiracy of silence
with which the dailies have striven to crush Mr.
O’Sullivan, or the chorus of derision which wss
the constant answer in the same papers to the
utterances of Messrs. Hetdon, Melville, and
LusOOMBB. The howlers merely followed the
example set them by the editors ef the Freetrade
papers. Taught by such taeticians. it is not strange
that the “ rabble” resorted te similar devicss. It
was a pity that the Protectionist eause shonld
have been obscured by such a scene, for its fol-
lowers may well be moderate in the hour ®f vic-
tory. And it is the consciousness of the defeat of
Freetrade throughout the N.B.W. that lends
Volume te the howl of its organs In Sydney. For
a local dally to be on the evidently unpopular side
is a thing unheard of, and it will really be very un.
pleasant for the Telegraph, Herald, News, and
Echo to pull down all the old idols and raise up
those which for years past they have been
pelting with calumns of contumely, in their
•tead. But it will have to he done.

Tundher and Turf.
“The man who expects to become great by elec-
trifying a bottle,” says Dr. Johnson, “ wonders
to see the world engaged in prattle about peace
and war.” In which saying the Doctor is abso-
lutely correct, but not exactly complete. The
man who really Is absorbed in electrifying the
bottle not only wonders that the world should
eare to prattle about its peace and war, but
becomes exceedingly Irate if it prattles so loudly
as to disturb his own philosophic calm. And wh°n
your philosopher Is disturbed—or, at least, wi en
bis processes are arrested or menaced -he awakes
rudely, and, with a shout, he cries, “ Tundher and
Turf!’’ Ilk# any Irishman, or H£lle and Teufels-
droeh, like a Teuton. He tUsaes the free
and fiery sword like poor »ld Dean Slat
Tjntv, or smites down the nearest small boy,
Eke Mr. PiOKWt««’S friend in whem the
combative spirit was stirred by a row In the street.
The Storey Dailt Telegraph is seeklag to
electrify a bottle just now, and the bottle is Sir
Henry Parke*. The Daily Telegraph flung
him out as a Read-marine a year ago, but as he’s
gone back on taat sin, has picked him out of the
dust-bin and set him on the operating-table, and
baring nothing to All him with seeks to electrify
him. We have all seen the lightning playing
about the poor old dead-marine, the lurid flare of
the "leaders,” the livid flashes of the "notes.” But
lomehew they don’t take on. No mirrored glow I
appears through the dead dull green. They set 1
him up in all manner of places before all sorts of
men, with a shout like that of churchmen at
Haster, a hallelujah-king-of-glory sort of busi-
ness; but the bricklayer who wants a job or the
ironworker spending his savings-bank balance
says: ‘‘Confound you, what are you blatherin’
about? He is a but a dead marine after aU.’’ Only a
dead-marine after all we have put Into him 1 This
Is contemptuous heresy indeed ? You want
something better than our electrified bottle, do
you ? Tour wants and your woes are not satisfied

Fenians, no true men whatever I You don’t want
good light or wholesome doctrine or sound philo-

But this la Just about a fair parallel to that case of
the D.T. against the statue orator who advertised
in the Freeman last week. A young spouter, eager
for an audience, put an advertisement into an
avowed party journal which, fluttering around
the square, hit the man with the bottle and broke
him up with a clatter and clamour to which
“ Tundher and Turf” isilligant, and “ Hollo und

Abbs Limte Is dead. They were covering che old
fellow with flowers, loading him with caresses In
London six months ago, and it was for his burial.
Many amongst them would have been glad to
bury him, for the Abbe’s knees, from his youth
upward, were stiff as were his Angers in his
extreme old age. He was presented to Czar
Nicholas 41) years ago, and in that time no
“ common ” man was permitted to approach that
presence but belly-wise-he must kneel at least
and kiss the extended hand. But the Abbe
never regarded himself as a common man, nor
did he regard any king as uncommon as to
require reverence. He advanced upright. Czar
made no sign. He came right on to the dais. Czar
Nicholas drew back, as Czar Albxandbb would
retreat if a man with a black beard and a
bulky waistcoat should approach him. Abbe Liszt
understood it all then, and turned with a scowl
and a laugh and left that presence for ever.
Frbdbbick Wilhhlm sent him diamonds and a
command to appear at Potsdam. He tossed the
diamonds right and left to the ballet-girls in the
side-scenes. “They may want them, perhaps have
earned them,” said he, “ I do not take commands.”
In 1834 he came across to England, and was per-
suaded to play before the king, but the sight of
that gross beast so disgusted him that he did not
cress the Channel again for more than 50 years.
The king of England’s brutality so offended the
musician that the people of England were de-
prived of the pleasure of his music for half a cen-
tury. He was a marvellously great man, and free
as strong. And what friends, what associates,
he had! Alfred db Musswr, Lamabtinb,
Victor Hugo— these were the men he knew, and,
knowing them, what did he care for kings ?
From 1864 to 1871 he worked almost exclusively
for the charities of his church. He was a gold
mine te them, and it may be they worked him a
little too hard. At least he went back to Hungary
in TL, and Hungary gave him a pension of J6OO a
year. He wanted it, for he was still poor, though
he had earned a million, perhaps, by his art. And
then he lived a while with his daughter, who had
married Bichahd Wagnbb, and laboured as
Director of the Academy for the Development of
Hungarian National Music. Travelled a good'deal,
and remembering that the royal beast who had
shocked and disgusted him was well dead and
buried, was induced to com* to England. His re-
ception in England was one of the latest events in
his life, and the nature of it was so true to the
genius and habit of Eoglishsooisty that ’tis worth
recalling. He had been guilty of the crime of in-
sulting kings, but his marvellous fame had left
all that in the background. He was big enough
to be worshipped, and it must be said mat when
English society resolves to worship it is very
thorough In the business. So duchesses hung
about the old man’s neck, and countesses smiled
sweetly on him, and princesses smoothed his long
I grey hair, and the males of the order said:
I “Aw pianaw deuced fine playaw, don’tcher
knaw.” And the organ of the order, whether
in jest or In earnest tm Impossible to say, terrlb y
offended the man whose real presence was ‘‘a
figure carved by Michael Angelo, standing in a
niche apart,” by carieaturing him as a servile
duke. It is quite possible that the Yanitt Fair
oartoon killed him, but If there was any fear of
the worship of society spoiling his old age, h© is
better dead. The Aim from the other side meets
the Fiat U from this now, without discord or pain.

W*; Exhibition to commemorate the Centenary of
N S.W. The occasion will be marked merely by
public orations. Jawbone Neild Is already la

At Penola (8. A.) a set of false teeth have
been seized by the customs officers for non-pay-
ment of duty. The owner Is using very bad lan-
guage, but he has to gum out his abuse until he

In Qippsland there lives a baker who is
more solid on the Commandments than even
finery Parkes. He charges 9d. for a loaf on week

In case of there being any hitch in getting
oneof the young Princes to open the Jubilee
Exhibition,.the people of Adelaide have requested
the Agent-General in London to make enquiries as
to the possibility of obtaining the carcase of the
late John Brown for the ceremony.
Despite the handsome Government and
private rewards offered, Mr. B. M. Bagot, the mis-
sing Adelaide cattle-salesman, cannot be found.
There is reason to suspect that he incautiously
went for a walk with one of the local Sunday-
school saints and was embezzled.
M T r - Young, a few days ago, declared in
the Victorian Assembly that the people of Ararat
had wasted the Government money by building a
bath » where he had seen “ the garments
of both sexes hung out to dry.” Among them he
fancied he recognised the shirt of the local mem-
ber, but he was not sure.
The Yass (N.S.W.) Evening Tribune an-
nounces that it will suppress the names of “ re-
spectable” drunks provided they pay ss. to the
hospital. Beastly drunks apparently receive no
such consideration. The editor does not state for
what consideration he will undertake to suppress
a member of Parliament.
A ball has been held at Newcastle “to
celebrate the anniversary of the return of the

The military profession must be going to
the dogs, judging from an advertisement In the
d.M. Herald:— “Good general wanted for a

some Potts Point aristocrat, who thinks It will

" Moltke, pass Mr. Smith the beans,” or “ Moukh-
tar Pasha, hurry up with the coals.”
The Melbourne coroner, Dr. Youl, stated
in a late inquest that falr-halred men were not so
well fitted to cope with rank odours as dark-haired
men. He was asked the reason why, and replied
that it was a physiological mystery. It Is not so to
us, however. Almost all the mashers we have seen
—young men with locks parted in the middle, don’t-
cherknow ?—have been dark-haired. See ?
Rev. Ashmead, of Mudgee, says that, “if
he spoke an uncharitable word against persons of
another religion he would be breaking the rules
that an Orangeman should strictly adhere to, viz.,
‘to strenuously avoid all uncharitable words or
actions towards his papist fellow beings.’ ” Now,
what Is “Popist” but an offensive term for a
Roman Catholic ? But then no parson except Syd-
ney Smith ever was a humorist.
“The detectives are enquiring re the per-
sons who placed the effigy of a woman on the
Ararat line, causing the railway officers to believe
that a female had been cut to pieces.” We are
glad that Justice is dogging the miscreants who
have perpetrated this atrocity. However, as there
would, even were a woman really killed, be no
traces of flesh and blood, it Is bard to say, after all,
whether some poor creature has not died. Modern
women are all clothes.
A Sydney paper recently published the
following surprising item of news:—“An aged
labourer named James Thompson, while riding on
the platform of an excursion train due at Redfern
at 8.50 p.m. on Saturday, lost his hat and then his
footnold, but was pulled back ©n to the platform
by a fellow-passenger with a broken thigh which
was fractured by the platform of the station as he
whirled by.” We are informed that an elderly lady
who was sitting in the carriage when the accident
happened with a dog was so much frightened that
she fainted, barking loudly, and had to be re-
moved to the hospital. She was a black and tan
terrier, with a white spot on her nose, but though
her bonnet was badly crushed she suffered no
erious injury.
Mr. C. Hayloox, surveyor, died of heart
disease at Naranclera. Tew surveyors were better
known than Haylook in the bush or in the city;
good at work and good at play Just a little too
good at this latter, perhaps, for the widow and
children he leaves behind. But that only makes an
opportunity for the Riverine squatters to display
their proverbial generosity.
Newcastle bicycle races were a huge suc-
cess, Fully 3500 present, including lots of ladies.
Tne course, 38 yards short of the quarter-mile, was
perfection, except for its narrowness, and won-
derfully fast. Local entries were limited, but
some of the men, notably Pairhall, Turnbull, and
G aham, promise well. The committee went la
for long races in heats, but the competitors didn’t
ste it, and the three-mile handicap and two-mile
bracelet races were each run as one event. The
maiden mils resulted: Turnbul, Reilly, Booth,‘the
last-named riding finely from scratch. Quirk
(Manly) took the safety prize. Phizackerley won
the three-mile, the limit man, J, Reed, with 175yds.,
coming second. Salwey, Chapman, and B.
M’Donald all came down in one great smash, and
the two latter had only themselves to thank, in
the final heat of the two-mile (championship of
the the Northern district), Reed led slowly on
sufferance till the last lap, when Pairhall
went ahead and won by 80yds. The final
for the two-mile open handicap resulted in
a magnificent struggle, when Turnbull heat
Kerrigan by hardly a foot. Turnbull will very
likely come down to the Association ground and
give trouble some day. Phizackerley, who was
virtually scratch at 40yds, won the five-mile open
handicap from Pry (175yds ), who had to do all the
running; and the ladles’ bracelet handicap of two
miles resulted in Chapman getting in first, Quirk
second, Fry third, M'Whinnle being untrained,
and Reed baked by his previous exertions. Chap-
man again nearly caused a catastrophe by boring
Quirk against the outiide ralis as he was passing,
and if the latter had protested, the committee
m.sfe hive given him the race. The Newcastle
people never laughed like they did atßollinson,
ai the masher learning to ride ; and Maltby made
them gasp. He rode the single wheel without
handles right round the quarisr-miletiaek. At
night the prizes were banned over by C. H. Han-
nell, after a good spread at Sidney’s hotel. P,
Reed, who rode 14 miles during the afternoon, re-
ceived a special prize for his hardihood and pluck.
Dogs were very numerous, and next time there
are bicycle races the committee ought to keep
them off the trac*. This might either be Hum by
providing them wi'h a grand stand tr tome
powder and shot.

Here is glory, if you
like, for a man who never
dreamt of it. There is a
paper published in Lon-
don, the name of which
is Public Opinion. This
paper gives extracts from
all the leading organs of
thought throughout the
world. In one of Its late
issues it republishes the
whole of an article pre-
viously published in the
Imperial Review. The
magazine bearing this
modest name Is entirely
written by one man—Mr.
Palmer, of the Melbourne
Herald. This gentleman
besides doing his dally
work-which, by the way,
he does well—is so much
of an enthusiast as to
write a whole magazine
by himself, and be a
Bombardier-General in
the Salvation Army be-
sides. The curious part
of the affair—in this con-
junction—is that the ar-
ticle tends to show that
teetotaliam in the colonies
“produces scarcely any
men of eminence, in the
very first rank, and is
severe upon the teeto-
tallerswho have figured
in the Victorian Legisla-
ture.” However, N.S.W.
is not In the position to
throw stones. Many of
her acts of Parliament
have been passed by a
majority of assertive hic-

ity of disaentive grunts.
Mr. Eiohards, the attorney, who got to-
gether the Crown’s evidence in the N.S.W. railway

Archibald Forbes, the war correspondent,
who has just married Miss Meigs, at Washington,
could not escape the penalty of being pictured in
the papers. The portraits issued by American
prints to hand make him look more like a brigand
than a bridegroom, and the letter-press which
follows it describes him as crouched and limpy
from rheumatism. The impression left is that
Miss Meigs has opened a military hospital.
While a group of “distinguished Aus-
tralians ” were being “ carted round ” the picture-

William Cecil. Salisbury out short this little
eulogy by remarking that Sir William might have
been a good statesman, but his taste in women
was indifferent, judging by the portrait of his
wife.
The King of the Belgians had a brief fly-
round In London last month. Anxiety was ex-
pressed; in some quarters lest his visit to the
great metropolitan mart was on “ business. The
merchandise in which his Majesty deals is mostly
human, and his London agent la the notorious
Mrs. Jeffries. Now that Sir Charles Dilke is tem-
porarily hors de combat, the amorous Leopold
ought to be able to pick up some good lines at
clearance-sale prices.
Ninian Melville, M.L.A., of N.S.W., plumes
himself on the fact that he addressed a public
meeting when he was only 17 years old. That is
good enough, but J. P. T. Caulfield, the “Boy
Politician,” once of Melbourne, now of Sydney,
completely overlaps that record. He started on
the stump when only 10 years old, and discussed
the political situation until there was no audience
left except a fat boy who had gone to sleep and
was snoring vigorously.
Mr. Piddington, M.L.C. of N.S.W., still
furiously objects to being cremated. The hon.
gentleman, it is stated, has already had his own
grave blasted out at a picturesque spot on the
Blue Mountains. But then everyone isn’t rich
enough to go by train after death to the Blue
Mountains. The only show a lot of people we
know will have of getting there is the off-chance
of being wafted on the winds to Mount Vittorla
after they evaporate from the government cre-
matorium of the future.
It is now rumoured that Prince Albert
Victor and that champion guinea-pig, the Duke of
Manchester, are coming instead of “Wales” to
open the one-horse show at Adelaide. Probably it
will be necessary in the end, however, to fall back
on an exiled French prince or on some disguised
nobleman from Kimberley. It is stated that the
son of a wealthy English peer is hunting for a
billet at Perth with very little success, and if he
is decently sober when the time comes he may
answer as a last resource. By the way, if Man-
chester leaves England again, what a time Har-
tington will have 1
There is a wicked rumour flying round
that “the Vagabond” is to be offered a C.M.G.-
ship. Ever since Julian—assisted by Bishop Moor-
house-started “three cheers for Her Gracious
Majesty,” at the opening of the Exhibition, he has
been universally accepted as a distinguished
colonist. One London paper, says rumour again,
recently referred to him as “Julian Vagabond,
Esq., the wealthy Australian squatter.” Anyhow,
the Vag. is keeping himself en evidence in London,
and if he only plays his cards right, he ought to be
able to give journalism best and set up as a
colonial company-promoter.
Sir Henry Loch was the innocent cause of
a sad catastrophe at Adelaide. Among other mild
dissipations In honour of his visit, Governor Loch
attended a Hunt luncheon. Mr. Bdwin Bagot at-
tended It too, and was introduced to the great
man. His Excellency and the luncheon combined
were too much for Mr. Bagot. That night he
mysteriously disappeared. Previously he had
been “ observed to stagger.” All of which goes
to prove our own private theory that no one
ought to rashly throw himself into the presence
of Governors unless he has just undergone an
elaborate course of physic. Governors are very
trying to weak constitutions.
The editor of the Gladstone (Q.) Observer
has sent a copy of his paper, printed on white silk,
to “ Wales,” as a testimony of personal esteem.
The paper, or rather silk, contains a history of the
town of Gladstone—a record full of thrilling
episodes regarding drainage and water-supply—
and H.R.H. will, of course, be graciously pleased
to—blow his nose in it on State occasions. If it
were only a little larger the Prince would probably
have it cut into a shirt, with the drainage article
carefully starched for the front, and the leader on
the drought and the Eastern question transposed
into a collar; while the social column about the
marriage of the local storekeeper’s daughter
would make an elegant tail; but, unfortunately,
the Observer is too flimsy to answer such a pur-
pose. The first time ** Wales" received an address,
the garment would split from Dan. to Beersheba.
Sheridan had a con-
venient formula for ac-
knowledging all the new

The Sydney D.T. de-
votes a leading article to
the Crawford-Dilke case,
and wants particularly to
know “why people should
be shocked at an immoral
baronet any more than at
an immoral bagman.” It
also remarks that “the
human nature of the
baronet is essentially the
same as that of the bag-
man,” &e., and altogether
makes it rather disagree-
able for the man with the
samples. We draw atten-
tion to this matter that
the Commercial Travel-
lers’ Association may re-
monstrate with Editor
Ward for thus offensively
coupling the decent busi-
ness of drummer and the
odious profession o £
baronet.
Says an American
paper “ The marriage
of Patti, spinster, with
Nlcollni, bachelor, is
doubtless to be accepted
as the condonation of a
long-continued and very
public exhibition of social
Indecency. It would be
better, we think, to give
somewhat less of pub-
licity to what this pair
call marriage. The in-
quiry will naturally arise,
if they are married now
and were spinster and
bachelor prior to the cere-
mony, what were their
relations before ? It is a
curious fact, the willing-
ness of good society to
overlook social miscon-
duct on the part of men
and women who show
genius upon the stage. It
is not very creditable.”
The London corre-
spondent of United Ire-
land says that Henniker
Heaton would be a Whig,
Tory, Radical, or Parnel-
lite, but the Tories were
the first to snap up him
and his money - bags.
These, however, are not
the exact words used by
the paper named, which
doesn’t by any means put
the case so delicately.
Apropos, have the Irish
members forgotten the
fact that, a few years ago,
when Henniker first
settled down in Great
Britain and began to sniff
round for a seat, he
formed one of the retinue
of Mr. Parnell on a
memorable occasion, and
seemed by no means dig-
pleased when it was an-
nounced that he intended
contesting an Irish con-
stituency in the National-
ist interest ?
The London papers are cutting their little
jokes anent colonial “ honours.” Speaking of a
recent supper given to the “Colonies clique at
Drury Lane Theatre, the Referee says: An im-

a K C.M.G. at the earliest possible opportunity.
By the way. stage spreads are becoming popular-
ised over here. While Sir Henry Loch was in
Adelaide the triumvirate gave a sort of free-and-
easy to viceroyalty at their shop. We believe a
certain manager intends to arrange a midnignt
social at his theatre, when the ladies of the billet
will*be specially invited to meet “ Government

lend them a little temporary assistance while they

But, whatever the petition is, Mrs. Wells wants it
signed by the gentlemen. She appeal to them at
her meetings. She pleads hard for her “poor,
dear, lost little pets.” She implores. She raves—
and finally Mrs. Wells tumbles off the platform
“ with a dull thud.” Even that doesn’t fetch the
hard hearted wretches as it should do. When she
lies fiat on the ground and sobs, “ Oh, do help my
poor little pets,” the meeting merely says ‘ dry

her crusade in such a pious city as Adelaide. The
saints of that citv don’t want to reclaim fallen
women. They prefer them as at present.
Vanderbilt died of apoplexy, yet he rarely

a very bad example of divided councils, but the
Richardson-Roberts administration of military
affairs is probably a sadder one, for it seems to
consist of a perpetual mining and countermining
between these officers, the time and energies of
one being largely consumed in defeating the pro-
fessional machinations of the other. When they
were respectively colonel and major, matters
were bad enough between them, but now that one
is a major-general and the other a lieutenant-
colonel, one a Companion of the Bath, fresh from
the Soudan, the other Companion of St. Michael
and St. George, and the fresher, perhaps, from not
having been at the Soudan, they have ‘strained
their relations ’ to pretty much the same con-
dition cf mutual dislike and distrust as prevails at
this moment between the leader of the Govern-
ment and the leader of the Opposition.”
When Sir Charles Dilke took a “ farewell ”
of his constituents, in public meeting assembled.
Lady D. dutifully saw her husband through his
trouble. She appeared on the platform leaning
upon Charley’s arm. Since the second trial and
its incidental disclosures it is to be presumed that
the faithful wife slips her trusting arm round
Charley’s waist whenever they take their walks
abroad. When a woman has once made up her
mind to stick, she sticks. “I will never desert
Mioawber,” said the immortal mother of that
gentleman’s twins. And in a similar spirit of
devotion, Mark Pattlson’s widow has determined
never to desert the morally dllapidatedlDllke. It
can hardly be that a bright, clever woman of the
world (twice married) remains so artless as to
swallow Charley’s version of the Mrs. Crawford-
cum-“ Fanny ” business. But in the presence of
the world she feigns to swallow It, and never
makes so much as a wry face. All honour to

Mr. H. Le Roy Lewis is at present illumin-
ating Melbourne with the light of his countenance.
One brief week ago we had never heard of Mr. Le
Roy Lewis, but that only shows our ignorance.
From the Melbourne Herald we glean that he is
“a visitor of distinction from England, who is also
a barrister, and very desirous of obtaining all pos-
sible information as to the colony and its resources
for future use in the British Parliament, which he
expects to enter before long.” It is paragraphs
like this which elevate the tone of Australian
iournalism. How delicately is the line drawn
which separates Mr. Le Roy Lewis from the every-
day globe-trotter 1 He is not merely a visitor of
distinction, but also a barrister—evidently a man
of all-round excellence and far-reaching capacity.
The British Parliament must want Mr. Le Roy
Lewis badly, and we hope he will enter without
any unnecessary delay. Gladstone Is getting old.
At any moment the English people may have to
look around for a new leader. Le Roy Lewis
should be on the spot—England wants him. He
can do much for England, but nothing for us. We
have borne long and patiently with distinguished
visitors,” genuine and spurious, all of whom have
expected to enter the British Parliament shortly.
But against a distinguished visitor, who is also a
barrister, we must indignantly protest.
At latest advices a baronetcy was to be'
conferred on Mr. M. Holloway, because his de-
ceased brother, Thomas, made a colossal fortune
out of quack-medicines, and built a sanatorium
and college in order to square his conscience.
Fancy being required to address a man as Sir
because his brother made pills 1 Sir James Cockle,
late of the Queensland Supreme Court Bench, son
of the other great pill-man, Is a knight, but he got
his title not through medicine, but through law,
and nothing riles the old man-he is a most accom-
plished mathematician, by the way—than any
reference to boluses. Now we come to think
about the matter, we are strongly of opinion that
Holloway should have had a pill knighthood,
and that the ex-Chief Justice of Queens-
land should have got the pill baronetcy,
on mor© than on© ground. Compared with
Cockle’s pills In point of efficacy, Holloway s
are a delusion and a snare, and deserving of only
the meanest titular distinction—say a C.M.G.-shlp,
But there is a grand indictment to be preferred
against Holloway which cannot be overlooked in
the present paragraphic disquisition. It is that
while Cockle’s pills are all of one have seen
pills taken out of boxes bearing a Hollo way-like
label which varied in bulk from that of a swam-
dropdownto that of a grain of dust-shot. We
have much pleasure in conferring a baronetcy on
our truly and well-beloved Sir James Cockle,
knight.
Areporter,who once “ pulled a hand-press
on a country weekly, tells this story: One day,
while the paper was being worked off, a man
from the country came in and walked all around
the room, finally stopping near the press and
watching the work very earnestly. “Anything
I can do for you ? ” asked the man at the lever,
pausing between Impressions. “No,” was the
reply, “ I don’t want nothin’. I just come to see
you edit.”
The Queanbeyan (N.8.W.) Agh reports
another death in the Melbourne Hospital.
“A cabman, Henry Richards, who was admitted
with a broken leg, having contracted the disease,
died on Tuesday.” We gather from this that an
epidemic of broken leg has appeared in the insti-
tution, and that the cabman died of it; or else
Henry Richards contracted his leg, and the dis-
ease died; or possibly it may mean that the Jehu
himself became contracted through his leg pass-
ing away. At all events, there appears to have
been a funeral at Melbourne Hospital.
Paris Figaro says that King Ludwig of
Bavaria succumbed to “ Wagner-morbus, a cere-
bral derangement, a rapid and invasive malady,
the progress of which can no longer be dissimu-
lated.” Its effects are declared to be “ disastrous
in th© extreme,” for its victims are “ insensible to
the joys of paternity, to society, to the spring, to a
good dinner, to a fine picture, or an interesting
book; they gradually succumb to the Wagnerian
virus, until their blood is perfectly exhausted and
their heart has withered away.” The man who
likes squalling babies and dislikes a good dinner
must indeed be mad. Personally, however, we
are disinclined to accept Figaro’s explanation of
the suicide of Bavaria’s champion crank. It is
now admitted that Louis was to have received a
“large and influential deputation” the day after his
death. Our opinion, therefore,is that he suspected
Henniker Heaton and a few other Australian
colonists were to form part of this gang, and that
when it came to a matter of either listening to
Henniker’s eternal yaup or taking his chance of
hereafter, he very wisely chose the least of the
two evils, and stepped out towards that lone dark
land which, as yet, is not made terrible by the pres-
ence of professional representatvie Australians.
BY FLOOD AND FIELD.
Newton and Lees’ postponed benefit oame
off on Saturday evening at Foley’s Hall, Sydney,
when a first-rate night’s sport was put on the
boards to a big attendance. The event of the show
was looked for in the meeting of Newton and
Lees, and they made a much better spar than on
their first appearance before a Sydney audience.
We liked Newton the better of the two, and we
have an idea that in a best and best “ go” Lees
could not live with the little ’un, who is undoubt-
edly an artist. Lees’ position is bad, as by his
crouching and bent knees he throws away the
length and reach with which nature has endowed
him. Black Parry, the best man who ever trod
Australian soil, used to crouch when sparring, but
when he hit he sprang with the blow, and great
was the fall thereof. One would suppose Lees, by
the reduction of his height, would keep his body
out of danger, but it is not so, as he only bends at
the knee, and his “ mark” is about the closest and
most open portion of his anatomy to his opponent,
and, by the way, he would appear to think so
himself, as he jealously guards that vital
spot with his right hand. When the champion
amateur appears the audience always look for
something out of the common, and they were not
disappointed on Saturday night when he faced the
Victorian boxer, Molloy. There would not be
anything out of the common in Mr. Seale besting
Molloy, as the latter is far removed from the first
flight, but it is his manner of doing it which takes
with the onlooker. Molloy has an above-the-
average quick left hand, but he might as well have
led at a sunbeam as at the amateur, who returned
five or six blows with both hands, varying his
attentions between the “ victualling department ”
and the “ dial,” until poor Molloy did not know
whether he was on his head or his heels from the
frequency of his visitations, but not from the
force of them, as the amateur was only having a
friendly set-to. Some good sparring was shown by
the lesser lights, and single-stick play was Indulged
in by Foley, Cansdell,! and others, but a Sydney
audiences have not acquired a taste or been edu-
cated to the game, and they much prefer the
" legitimate ” business.
* * *
Next Saturday night “ Professor” Jaok-
who is matched against Lees, takes a benefit at
AN AUSTRALIAN “CHILD” OF SEVENTEEN.
“The Mayor and Mayoress (Miss Young) intend giving a juvenile ball for children
between thirteen and seventeen years of age, at Sydney Town-hall, in about a fort-
night.”
Foley’s Hall. M'Carthy and Smith, who fought
such a slashing encounter the other afternoon,
graduated from Jackson’s Academy, and he has a
host of “ talent” who are sure to show up for his
benefit. Steve O’Donnell and Dan Hickey ought
to make a tip-top set-to, and four rounds between
them would be well worth seeing.

The return match between N.S.W. and
Queensland footballers, under Rugby rules, came
off on the Association Ground, Sydney, on Satur-
day last, and the bad judgment, if notfavouritism,
in the selection of the first and defeated N.S.W.
team, could not have shown better than by the
fact that in their second trying the N.S.W. selec-
tion committee got together a team which de-
feated the Queenslanders by 38 points to 5 point l ?.
On what lines the selection is made we cannot
understand. In the last team Burwood was not
represented, and still we don’t mind wagering a
bottle of gingerbeer that the Suburban Ciub beats
Wallaroo at the next time of asking. Why is this
thus ?
• • *
For right down brutal sport commend us
to a dog-fight, Graeco-Roman wrestling, and last,
but by no means least, a game of Rugby football.
In the Intercolonial match on Saturday, one of the
Queensland team was carried off the field with a
broken collar-bone, and another with his head
open. We presume that the authorities put their
foot on prize-fighting on account of its alleged
brutalising tendency. If such is the case, then
why allow Rugby football as a lawful game ? In a
prize-fight a bloody-nose and a black-eye are
usually the worst injuries. If a man is thrown
during a fight, he has but one man to fall on him.
In Rugby football it is “sacks-en-the-mill,” and
God help the undermost, who is lucky if he
escapes with a broken collar-bone. We don’t
object to the young ’uns maiming themselves if It
pleases them, but it seems a farce for the law to
make fish of one and fowl of the other, on the
score of brutality, as there have been far more
permanent injuries between the goal-posts than
between the posts of a prize-ring.
* * *
At the annual games of the Manhattan
Athletic Club, New York, some fine performances
were put in by the amateurs in their record-
breaking efforts. Wendell Baker, the champion
sprinter of Harvard College, who at his favourite
distances may be looked upon as the successor to
D. E. Myers, the ex-champion amateur, covered
135yds. in the stated time of 13 3-sseo., and A. A.
Jordon ran 130yds. over hurdles in 16 l-ssec., which
beats the former American record by three-fifths
of a second.

Another identity of the palmy days of
“ the ring ” passed away in London on June 8 in
the person of Harry Brunton. Tom Sayers pos-
sessed no firmer friend than the deceased, who
acted as his second in some of his principal battles.
His fighting weight was Oat. 41b., and he appeared
thrice in the ring as a principal, defeating Hussey
in 1849 and Duffln in 1850, and suffering defeat at
the hands of Bill Cain during the latter year.
Edward flanlan, although only ex-oham-
pion in bona-fide rowing circles, still takes the
cake in hippodrome business. On June 4 and 5
Edward brought off a regatta on Toronto Bay
with great success. Hanlan won the single sculls
with ridiculous ease from Conly, Hamm, Lee,
Plaisted, Hosmer, M'Kay, Ritz, and Staunton; and
Hanlan and Lee won the double sculls.

In America, Frank Herald is the latest
aspirant for championship honours in the pugi-
listic line. Mike Conley, known as the “ Ithica
Giant,” standing 6ft. lin., and weighing 14st. 91b.,
was matched, some time since, against an 11 un-
known,” and the glove contest camo off in New
York on June 31. The “unknown” turned up
in Herald, who had never put up his hands in
New York, and the match was looked upon as a
foregone conclusion for Conley, who had for some
time had a challenge out to box any man bar
Sullivan. On the men facing each other, Herald
led with his left straight as a line on Conley’s
mark, and, to quote a Yankee scribe, “ the Nice-
town crasher’s ponderous fist fairly dented the
giant’s victualling department.” Conley coun-
tered, but missed, and Herald landed another
crasher on to his opponent’s right eye, and, to
again quote, “Conley joined the tarly closing
association.” Conley then tried in-fighting, but
Herald bested him at the game and landed a
terrific right-handed upper-cut on the:point of
the jaw, when the giant camo down with a crash,
and when the 10 seconds necessary for Herald to
win the fight were ticked off Conley was still in his
balmy slumber. Herald’s backers at latest were
trying to get on a match with John L. Sullivan or
any man in the world for £5OO a side.
* * *
We see by the latest American flies that
on June 13, at Lake Calumet, Pullman, 111., Jacob
Gaudaur defeated Teemer, the American cham-
pion, which no doubt accounts for the matching
of Gaudaur against Beach. Teemer was never in
it with Gaudaur. and gave up before he completed
the course, but he does not appear to have been
himself, as he “ was ill ” at intervals for several
hours during the afternoon of the day on which
he rowed, a trouble which was thought to be due
to the combined effects of exposure to the heat
of the sun in the forenoon and overtraining.
Gaudaur’s backers must have been in great fig
over his victory, however, to have jumped at
such big game as Beach. Of Gaudaur, an American
paper says:—“ Gaudaur’s victory over Teemer
proves him beyond, all contradiction, to be
a first-class oarsman. He was not pushed in
any part of the race, and yet when Teemer gave
up, he rowed the course, three miles with a turn,
in 30mln. 20sec. If Teemer had not broken down,
or his right arm became useless, owing to an over-
strain, and he had pressed Gaudaur, the fastest
time on record would have been beaten, and
oaudaur would have rowed the race in 19min.
37ae0., the time he made in a trial two days before
the race. Time is no criterion of oarsmanship, we
are aware, but it must be acknowledged when a
man rows a trial on a lake in 19min. 27sec„ he can
repeat the performance within 10 seconds on a
calm day. Beach may be a wonder in a shell, and
able to beat anybody in his own climate and on his
own water, but it is doubtful whether he could on
the 13oh June, have beaten Gaudaur on Lake
Calumet.” Gaudaur is described as a fine, power-
ful sculler, weighing 13 stone, and taking into con-
sideration the loss of prestige caused by the con-
tinued defeats of the colonial scullers now in
England, we shall not be surprised if Gaudaur
starts favourite for his race with Beach.

To come nearer home, and to smaller lights
in the aquatic world. Young Matthews made a
one-horse show of his match with G ascoigne, rowed
over the Parramatta champion course, in wager
boats, on Saturday last. Gascoigne, as was ex-
pected, went away with the lead, but before a mile
had 'been covered Matthews took command, an<
henceforth held Gascoigne at his mercy. The
winner rowed the boat Matterson pulled againsi
Beach, which. It may be imagined, la a deal too big
for such a mite in the rowing world. Though nol
yet 18 years of age, standing sft. and 4in„ and only
weighing Sat. 91b„ the young tiger has defeated
Freeman twice, Dunn, Croad, Swift, Nlcholls, and
Gascoigne, la addition to winning a race at Pyr-
mont and Ylpond’s trophy. The youngster is as
good as they make ’em at the size, but it is to be
hoped his friends will not let him overdo it. Ho
now requires a lengthened spell,

The Brisbane Courier has been holding
forth, in a lachrymose strain, on the present con-
dition of the Australian turf. "Everything,”
says the Courier, "is sacrificed to qualities that
are essentially artificial. The horses are trained
too young. Speed over a short course being the
one thing needful, spindle-shanked animals are
the order of the day.” Racing Jeremiahs have
been raising these lamentations for the last 50
years, and meanwhile the quality of thoroughbred
horses has steadily improved. That many of these
are trained too young is, unfortunately, true
enough; but on the other hand, it must be remem-
bered that two-year-olds of the present day are
very different cattle to the youngsters of 40 years
back. Thanks to the development of breeding art,
they are altogether bigger-boned and better fur-
nished than their ancestors at the same age. Such
a horse as was Philip Augustus last season would
have been considered a phenomenon by our grand-
fathers. Granting, however, that there are
evils attached to two-year-old racing, yet its
bitterest opponents (provided they know their
subject) are forced to admit that blood-
stock, on the whole, has in no way deterio-
rated since the system was popularised. But where
the Courier chiefly twaddles is in representing
speed over a short course as an essentially artifi-
cial quality. Time was when that theory found
favour, but it exploded under the test of practical
experience. The old school of English steeple-
chase horses (mostly half-bred) were reverenced
as marvels of endurance and “ staying ” power.
They went as fast at the end of a four mile
journey across country as they did at the begin-
ning. Their admirers complacently compared
them with the " weeds ” that couldn’t gallop a
yard more than six furlongs on the flat. They
never took into consideration the miserable pace
at which the sturdy, heavy-limbed chasers
" stayed ” four miles. At length a bookmaker
named Hughes conceived the idea of putting a
pretty nigh worthless sprinter to the jumping
business, and it was speedily found that many a
horse which could only last for six furlongs in
good company on the fiat could " stay for a month
beside the cross-country veterans. “Staying
power” is simply a relative term. The horse
which drops back beaten before the end of a
mile race at Raadwiok may gallop his op-
ponents to a standstill at two miles in soma
minor up-country handicap. We have seen and
heard a broken-winded horse canter in for a two-
mile race in England, because the rest of the field
were not speedy enough to distress him, and it may
be confidently assumed that the non-stayers of the
present generation could do four miles in quicker
time than the much-vaunted stayers of the past.
Thus much has been accomplished by an ever-
improving system of breeding and training. But
when the Courier goes on to d eplore the " low
weights for jockeys ” (it means horses) an element
of common sense is introduced into the article.
Undoubtedly it would be more satisfactory to
owners and public alike if the scale were raised.
Under the present system a bad handicap horse
carries stones less than welght-for-age, so called.
Again and again an owner sees a race thrown away
by the incompetency of the juvenile pigmy he is
compelled to put upon his horse’s back. At present,
unhappily, there seems no prospect of any change.
Only last week the Y.R.C. rejected the proposal
of Mr. George Davis that the minimum weight to
be carried by any horse in any handicap flat race
be 6st. 71b. It was argued that our minimum is
6st, and that "federation” in sport is desirable.
If the A. J.C. can arrange for handicap federation
on a higher scale, it will confer a real benefit upon
the Australian turf and Australian manhood,
Light-weight jockeys are specially reared now-a-
days, and the increase and multiplication of their
kind must eventually lower the physique of a
nation, though in ever so infinitesimal a degree.
When a 7-stone man gets married, it is our firm
belief that old father Adam (now in Heaven) weeps
bitterly.

Mr. Thomas Stevens, who undertook to go
round the world on a bicycle, has been turned
back in Afghanistan. He was conducted to the
frontier, and when he asked what the Asiatic
deuce theyjmeant, he only got the answer; “ There
is but one God, and Mahomet is his prophet.”

Bendigo, the winner of the £lO,OOO Eclipse
Stakes, has proved a little gold-mine to his owner,
Mr. H. T. Barclay. In previous years Bendigo has
landed the Lincoln Handicap, and Cambridgeshire,
besides many races of minor importance, The
victory would be a thoroughly popular one, for
Mr. Barclay bears quite as good a reputation as his
horse on the English turf.

Jack Dempsey, we read, “ positively denies
that he ever Issued a challenge to fight either
Mitchell, Burke, or M’Caffrey. He wishes it un"
derstood that he has retired from the prize-ring*
and will go to work at his trade, that of a cooper*
or else embark in some other legitimate trade.
He says, as long as he can get a day’s work he will
not fight again.” Dempsey has an unbeaten
record of 43 battles, and is probably the best man
of his weight who ever entered a ring.

Victorian football circles are protesting
against the win, tie, or kill tactics of their cham-
pion twenty, the South Melbourne. The tiger in
his native jungle is a gentle unassuming animal
compared with a “ Sowth” warrior when the tide
of fortune is setting in against his si-i-de. He has
several modes of “ putting away” his opponent,
has the " Sowth” man. Sometimes with his head,
frequently with his fists, and usually with his feet.
If all else fails he commences to curse and to
swear, and the effect is instantaneous. Foot-
ballers, as a rule, don’t make any bones of an oath
or two, but the curse of a “ Sowth” Melbourne
man possesses virtues peculiarly its own. It
paralyses the unlucky recipient, and the ball drops
from his nerveless hands. The supporters of this
“ champion” club are well worthy of their repre-
sentatives. Up to present date the “ Sowth”
has lost no matches this season, but in the
confident expectation of blood being shed if
these redoubtable rowdies do get worsted, the
more civilised of the football patronising public
are agitating for “ something to be done.” There
must be limits fixed to .blackguardism—even in
football matches.

The Bulletin’s London correspondent
writes thus of Beach’s music-hall starring:—“ I
went to the Royal Music Hall the other night to
see this most unsportsman-like exhibition. Beach
was led on the stage by the acting-manager, who
proceeded to read a list of the champion’s
triumphs. Then Beach was left alone for a few
moments, and, hitching his shoulders awkwardly,
and rubbing his hands down the sides of his coat,
he thanked the audience for their kind applause,
said he meant to beat Hanlan again, that the best
man would win, and that he know he should get
English fair play on the Thames. During this
stumbling effort at speech-making he emphasized
the fact that he was born in England, which I
thought rather ungrateful to the country that
reared and has done so much for him. Then
Deeble was brought on and introduced as Beach’s
backer, and Deeble bowed, and Beach bowed, and
then they shambled off, and I came away feeling
decidedly disgusted. However, I mean to back
Beach for my little pot. Hanlan, who his
still considered invincible here, will be heavily
backed, and I should not be surprised if the odds
are on him, so I look forward to winning a trifle.”

On Saturday afternoon, the 31st ult., the
marriage of Miss Marion Josephson, eldest
daughter of Judge Josephson, of St. Killians,
Rose Bar, Sydney, to Lieutenant J. Clarke, R.N.,
of H.M.S. Miranda, took place at All Saints
Church, Woollahra, when a large number of
fashionable guests and spectators assembled.
Punctually at 2 o’clock the bridegroom, accom-
panied by his best man, Lieutenant Tufnell, R.A.,
of H.M.S. Miranda, took his place at the altar-rails,
and a few minutes after, the bride, escorted by her
father, entered the church, and the ceremony was
performed by the Rev. Wallace Mort. The bride
was very handsomely dressed in the richest ivory
satin, the front of the skirt and corsage being
covered with valuable lace, and sprays of orange
blossoms were arranged about the skirt; the hair
was ornamented with a small wreath of the bridal
flowers over which fell a long tulle veil. Five
bridesmaids were in attendance, the two first being
dressed in cream-coloured cashmere, with trim-
mings of the same coloured frisiS cloth, large
sailor hats turned up at the back with a large
bow; they also carried large wreaths of flowers,
with hanging cream ribbons on which were printed
“ H.M.S. Miranda” In gold letters. The three other
bridesmaids wore costumes of the same style.
After the ceremony the party drove to St. Kil-
lians, where the wedding breakfast was prepared,
after which the bride and bridegroom took their
departure, going by train to Mount Victoria, where
the honeymoon is to be spent. Mrs. Clarke s
travelling dress was very pretty, and consisted of
dark brown cloth profusely trimmed with fur—hat
and parasol en suite. The presents were very
numerous and valuable.

Sir W. J. Clarke, Baronet, returns to
Melbourne in October, bringing his new degree of
D.C.L. (Cam.) with him. Beyond the acquisition
of this well-deserved academical distinetlon, Wil-
liam’s pilgrimage home has been somewhat un-
fruitful. In the blessed hope of a resur-dook-
dom, the worthy Orceaus planked down £lOO for
the roval box at the Exhibition opening show.
His effusive loyalty fell fiat. It is said, by the
way, that William was altogether taken in over
this speculation. His Idea in hiring the royal box
was that her Gracious Majesty would share it with
him. They were to go “ whacks ”in the throne,
and he would hold the sceptre when Victoria
wanted to scratch her head, or use the royal hand-
kerchief. Yes, that Exhibition venture was a
disappointing affair- Lady Clarke, too. has had
her trials and tribulations. Miss Ethel C. was ex-
pected to get the refusal of a choice assortment of
coronets, but the British aristocracy has been
backward in coming forward. Perhaps, after all,
Tyleoote, the cricketer, will have to be the happy
man. When Ivo Bligh came over to marry a fair
protegie of the Clarkes, Mr. Tylecote accompanied
him with the laudable ambition of marrying into
the family. Somehow, he went back again,
empty-handed and cold-shouldered. As an emer-
gency man Mr. 'J'. may now find his services ac-
ceptable. Melbourne ladies are discussing the
question In its varied aspects.

On Tuesday evening, the 27th ult., Mrs.
Henry C. White, of Calingra, Ocean-street, Wool-

and seats were arranged about for the pleasure of
the guests, who numbered over 100.

Many a young heart in Albury beat fast
on Thursday evening last in anticipation of the
ball which was to take place that night. For was
it not a recherche, tiptop, ding-dong affair ? Several
of the leading ladles of the Federal City had
decided to give a plain and fancy dress ball,
almost at a moment's notice, and Sydney and
Melbourne were consequently placed under con-
tribution for a supply of fancy dresses. Miss
Prendergast, a young lady from Melbourne, as
“Daughter of the Regiment,” was simply perfect
in dress, figure, and style; Miss Hayes as “ Diana,”
Miss Minnie Moore as " Mary Queen of Scots,”
little Miss Fowler (Melbourne) as “Starlight,”
Mies Esther Moore as “Folly,” and Miss Shaw
(Sydney) as “80-peep,” were also deserving of
special mention.

an excellent floor for dancing, was prettllv de-
corated with flags, and had at one end a raised dais
carpeted and furnished with luxurious lounging
chairs. The hostess wore black satin duchesse,
train and bodice, the front of the skirt was

church was appropriately decorated, and was
filled with Interested spectators and guests.
The bride, who looked thoroughly happy, wore a
very handsome dress of white satin, made with
Court train, and profusely trimmed with orange
blossoms and jessamine. The front of the dress
was covered with handsome lace, and the long
white tulle veil was arranged over a wreath of
orange blossoms. Six bridesmaids were in attend-
ance, and were dressed in pairs to match. Two
were in cream and pink, two in cream and helio-
trope, and two in cream and blue; they all wore
high crowned plush hats to match their costumes.
After the ceremony, the party adjourned to Ken-
sington, the residence of the bride’s mother, where
iraakfast was partaken of, and where, in the
evenisg, about 70 or 80 guests assembled at a dance.

season were presented by Mr. Hamilton, the chair-
man of the club, to the successful competitors.
The hall was then cleared, and dancing was in-
dulged in until the small hours. Many frocks
worn on this occasion were worthy of admiration.
A pale blue, covered with silver spangled tulle,
was remarkably pretty, also a white satin draped
with quantities of flame-coloured tulle, and flame-
coloured bodice. A rich red plush, with tablier of
cream satin, was handsome, and a sea-green silk
profusely trimmed with white lace, was verv
pretty and becoming.

Mr. R. S. Smythe displayed his wonted
sagacity in arranging for the appearance on the
Sydney concert platform of tne sisters Joran.
Their performance on Thursday night was an
evident success, and the acknowledgement of
their powers an undoubted guarantee of future
popuiarity. This is just the sort of show that
will suit the much-travelled. He is never so happy
as when he is intimately associated with talent of
some sort, in art, literature, or science, while he is
generally supposed to be not quite impervious to
the charms of beauty. The regrettable incident
in connection with the appearance of Madame
Boema probably arose out of a misunderstanding
with regard to the customs of the profession.
Madame, In consenting to sing, evidently
meant 10 give one number only, and thought
that no more was required, while Mr. Smythe,
perhaps more conversant with the interpretation
of such contracts, considered two songs the rule
under the circumstances, and claimed that had
only one song been required It would, according
to custom, have been so nominated in the agre
ment. Therefore It happened that when Madam
came on to the platform to fulfil what she believe
to be the contract, no accompanist came forwar
Had Mr. Smythe allowed Mr. Huonerbeln
accompany, this would have implied consent o
his part to accept less than he believed shou
rightly have been given. While regretting th
unfortunate incident we are unable to join in th
general lament concerning some supposed “ ailroni
to the Governor." Why his lordship should be espe
clally considered is a problem that we must leave t
the groveller* of the Press aud their sympathiser
among the people. We suppose that Governo
Carlngton paid to go in like all the rest, and w
think that whether this were the case or not, an
affront (we cannot see that there was any) must b
divided equally among all of those who wer
present,

Hbrmbs is the latest literary production
emanating from Sydney University. Strangely
enough, it does not appear to satisfy “ a
long-felt want,” but is announced as “an
enterprise which could not have remained
unattempted much longer.” From the edi-
torial column we learn that “ blatant members
of Parliament have thrown mud at us (the under-
grade ) so often that some of it has stuck,” and it
is presumably for the purpose of scraping off thia
mud that Hermes has sprung into existence.

The loss on the recent performance of

The hall in celebration of the Gundagai
railway opening, on the night of the 21st, was a
conspicuous success. Music good, floor ditto, and
ladies—well, they are always lovely around Gunda-
gai. Mrs. Gumming wore a rich costume of cream
duohesse satin, beautifully embroidered with
pearls in front, side panels of ruby plush, and a
splendid train—garnet necklace and ornaments
completed this really beautiful costume. Another
noticeable dress was a rich white silk trained
dress, profusely trimmed with rich lace and
flowers. This was worn by Mrs. Simpson, of
Gootamundra, and became the charming wearer
well. A beautiful dress for a married lady was
worn by Mrs. O'Dwyer, the wife of the local
doctor. It was a seal brown merveilleux, richly
trimmed with tulle and lace, looped up with lovely
cream chrysanthemums; Migs Lee(Jugiong) wore
a pale-green satin, draped with silver-tufted tulle,
looped with moss roses and pale-pink velvet bows.
An amber necklace and bracelets completed this
costume—and the wearer, a beautiful blonde, was
much admired. Another much-admired costume
was a pale-blue satin, draped with pale-blue
tufted tulle, worn by Miss Fry, of Gundagai.
Mrs. D L. M'Kenzie wore a rich costume of
amber plush, draped with black lace, and looped
with chrysanthemums; Mrs M Killop cream broche
and lace; Mrs. Solomon, pale-green satin lace and
pearls; Mrs. Donnelly (Junee), cream satin and
ruby velvet; Mias Donnelly, pale-blue satin lace
and pearls; Mrs. Abrahams, white brocade and
pearls; Miss Gumming, cardinal brocade and
cream lace, ornate witn beautiful wild flowers;
Miss M'Auliffe (Jugiong), a trained black silk,
draped with crimson anu gold tufted tulle, looped
with; gloire de dijon roses; Mrs. Donaldson, black
surah and jet; Mrs. Paine, rich black lace costume;
Miss White, cardinal and black. The most notice-
able of the fancy dresses were “ Juliet,” worn by
Miss Marshall (atasteful costume); “Erin,” Miss
Wilson; “ Moonlight,” Miss B, Marshall; “Italian
Girl,” Miss A. Fry; “Southern Cross,” Mias Oooney;
“Highland Lassie,’ Miss Burnle; “Ambulance
Nurse,” Mrs. Ogg; “ Italian Girl,” Miss Madigan;
“Polish Hussar," Miss Carroll; “ Vlvandlere,"
Mrs. F. Cohen. The Ministerial party departed at
30, but dancing was kept up till 5 a.m,, when the
most successful bail ever held in Gundagai was
brougnt to a termination.

adheres very closely to his own particular spear
of usefulness, and he makes things hot for the
auriferous pilgrim.
According to the report of a wealthy
syndicate, who has just returned in a dusty and
shoeless condition from Kimberley, that place is
even a trifle worse than has been hitherto sup-
posed. About 1500 men are now on the field, and
have got some 3000 oz. of gold among them, or an
average of nearly £6 per head, and on a rough
estimate nearly 4000 more diggers are on the road,
to this valley of dry bones to share the plunder.
At Derby it is sometimes difficult to find even a
pennyweight of gold, and the chief amusement
jaeems to bejiynting up men. who wroto glowing
accounts of the district and watching them skip
for the wilderness to avoid being lynched. The
town is choked up with stores which no one has
money to buy, and at Cambridge Gulf things are
equally unpromising. Even the long-looked-for
wet season is not likely to do much good, for on
the field the water only lasts seven or eight days
at the most a f ter the rain has ceased, and appar-
ently the satyr who used to roost on the broken
walls of Nineveh might have gratified his insane
love for desolation by camping out on the Kim-
berley goldfield. But unless he carried his own
provisions there is every chancs that he would
have starved.

He has discovered, he says, that in Syoney the

named Foley to a body of men entirely Roman

object of this is to have a transubstantiation gang

priestly move may be met with a truly Protestant
check. The author of this letter has evidently
struck on a genuine danger, and his statements
deserve all possible publicity. There is every
reason to believe that the real purpose of Foley’s
Gymnasium is to train a crowd of mutton-fisted
Papists, whose business it will one day be to knock
their Protestant fellow-citizens into gory dish-rags
and wipe their Roman boots on the Lutheran

after six rounds with Foley he has been heard to

out of the Bishop of Sydney and put him under
the pump. If this sort of thing is allowed to con-
tinue, Protestantism will, sooner or later, be pul-
verlsed into boarding-house hash, and Pope Leo
XIII., K.C.M.G., will usurp the billet of Mayor of
Sydney and levy a half-benefit !at the Protestant

THE STORY OF BERTRAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CHAPTER I.—TWENTY YEARS AGO.
Sydney is silent. The roar of traffic has died
away. Theatres are empty, and shops closed.
The last ’bus has left the city, the last bell has
rung on the landing-stage of the ferry. Bed and
green lights gleam from the hay, hut there, as
Well as on the streets of the city, the silence if
night has settled down. It is within a quarter of
an hour of midnight. A light burns in No. 7,
Wynyard-square. It is in a small room, the work-
shop of Sydney’s most fashionable dentist. But
more than dentist’s art is practised there.
The light is low. Two men stand before it.
Both are young, slight, pale, quick in movement,
keen in glance. The elder is in bis 251 h jeer,
While the younger is barely 20. They look at eac h
other in silence. The elder is a man of plans. He
is email of stature and gentle in demeanour, hut
his Intellect is violent. He is master here. Where
master he Is tyrannous, exacting, ravenous for
speedy results. But he knows how to make an
Instrument of an associate. The younger man
steps back ss he is looked at. The words dropped
are whispers. The light is turned down.
“ Ready ? ” asks the one.
Ready;” answers the other.
The door opens. Two men moving like shadows
pass cut of No. 7. They do not speak till they
nave got cut of Wynyard-square. Then their
words are low, slow.and of commonplace import.
They tread the silent streets. Tney descend to
the wharves. A heat is ready. The younger
jumps In first. The elder looks around. The city
is silent behind. Lamps flicker on the top of the
hill. At the other side of the wharf a waterman
rests on his oars. The second shadow glides into
the boat.:. “
The oars splash, and the boat moves forward.
The moon comes cut, and the broad waves raise
their crests. They flaunt their silvery-white
head-gear in the world’s ballroom. The two men
ply the oars. The younger leans tack so as to
hold the elder in full view. Neither speaks. They
reach land. Above them is North Shore. Tying
up the boat they climb the hill. In five minutes
they come teahouse. It is silent, dark, but the
moonlight falls upon it. They come near it.
“See,” says the elder, “that is bis bedroom I
The moon shines on the window. We are too
early. We must come back another night.”
Three nights after oars splash in the waves, and
the same two men approach North Shore. It is
near one o’clock in the morning. There Is little
wind, and ihe moon is low. The elder whispers,
“He may he found dead in his bed. It will be
suicide. He will have Jackson’s letters in his
hands, and people will say ' He killed himself, be-
cause he found his wifel faithless 1’ Eh?” The
younger does not speak. Be leans farther hack
andiwatches more closely the movements of his
companion.
They tie up the boat at the wharf, and again
climb the bill. The same house stands wrapped in
darkness and silence before them. Within ad< zen
yards of it they pause. Tne elder take s off his
hoots and gives them to the younger. Stealthily
he glides to the front of the house. He raises the
dining-room window and noiselessly enters. The
hreeze freshens and trees in the distar ce creak.
An hour passes. The figure returns through the
dining-room window, noiselessly draws down the
sash, and crosses over to where the younger man
waits. Be finds him sleeping. He takes his boots,
awakes him, and says: “ Come. 1 tailed again.
His beer was drugged, hut he didn’t touch it. He
•tarts up in bed every now and then. But I will
gain ray end yet. His wife must he mine alone!
Come, shake yourself; let us go home.”
Once again, on another night, men climb the bill.
The elder has a tomahawk barging by a string
under his coat.
|,“What have you against the man?” asks the
younger, as they slink along in the darkness.
“ I want his wile.”
“ But you and she are intimate as it is. What is
the ob J ?at of killing him ? ”
“ I want her all to myself.”
“ And your own wife ? ”
“I’ll get a divorce; I’ll pay someone to get up
something against her.”
The whispers end. The elder removes his boots,
goes to the same window, enters, puts his hand to
the lock of the door. Be has previously taken the
screws out and put the lock back in its place with
putty. Now it falls off in his band. He grips the
tomahawk and listens. What other sounds are
these he hears ? Other men besides the one he
seeks sleep in the house tc-night. One is Jackson,
a rival in adultery. The other is Llewellyn, the
adulterous woman’s brother. The man with the
tomahawk stands in the passage and considers.
Would it be safe ? He spends an hour in the dark-
ness and among the stertorous sounds of slumber
deliberating. At last be puts the tomahawk back
under his coat, returns through the window, and
With his associate descends the bill. Is be baulked ?
See him again. He has a red Crimean shirt cn ;
his face is blackened, his moustache shaved iff,
and in the darkness before the bouse he swallows
a couple of glasses of brandy. If he is seen he
will not be recognised. The red shirt will not
show marks of blood. The associate hands him
the tomahawk. He goes In. He stays there three-
quarters of an hour. When he comes out he is
angry. Be has not had a chance to use the toma-
hawk.
“ Ceme in with me,” he whispers to his associate.
“If anything happens, take my part and knock
the brains out of whoever interleres.”
“I have no share in the man’s wife,” replies the
associate, “and would rather go home.”
The two men stand in the dentist’s workshop at
No. 7 Wynyard Square.
“ Have you any pistols ?” asks the elder.
“I have one,” replies the other, “but it is no
“Do you know where any could he got, and
where anyone might buy them without heiug re-
cognised ?”
“I don’t know, but I will try to obtain a couple
for you.”
“I will get them myself. Will you meet me tc-
night at 8 o’clock opposite Betty’s Hotel? 1 will
dress as a woman.”
.Two persons that night enter Levy and Co.’s
Shop in Lower Georg e-street, and one of them
stepping forward to the counter desires to see
some pistols. The other, who looked to he a
woman, remains at the door. Two pistols are
purchased, the person at the door supplying the
money. On the day after, a sheep's htao is pur-
chased- It is mounted in the dentist’s workshop.
The elder man loads the pistols and fires several
times at the sheep’s hiad. Be then orders the
sheep’s head to be taken down and burned.
“ What did you fire at it for ?”
“I wished to know which part of the skull the
bullet would enter into the soonest. The side of
the temple between the eye and the ear is the best
On the 6th ol October, 1865, the people of Sydney
were shocked by the announcement that Mr.
Henry Kinder, chief teller in the City Bank, had
committed suicide by shooting himself in the head
at his residence in North Shore. The pistol-shot
appeared to have been fired four days previously,
but the deceased wile and a couple of acquaint-
ances, who were on a visit to the house at the
time, kept the matter quiet, thinking, as they
stated, that the unlortunate man might recover.
Mr. Kinder, who was a native of London, was, at
the date of his death, 35 years of age. He had been
only two years in Sydney, but had been many
years in New Zealand, where he had held positions
in the Union Bank and in the Bank of New Zea-
land. He was in debt when leaving New Zealand,
and appeared to have found it difficult to answer
the demands made upon his salary in the City
Bank. His wife was about five years younger
than himself, and he had two children. He was
much given to the use of stimulants. He was able
to transact his business while in the bank, but
generally reached home in drink. Still, he saw a
good deal of company at his house. On the occa-
sion ol the tragedy, Mr. Henry Louis Bertrand, a
dentist, carrying on business in Wynyard-square,
and his wife were staying in Kinder’s house.
At the inquest held on the body at Dlnd’s hotel,
North Shore, on the day following the death, the
testimony of Mrs. Kinder and her two guests was ,
taken, together with that ofWilllsm Cooper, an
officer in the City Bank, and that of Dr. Bicbier,
the medical man who bad been called in on the
night of the tragedy. Mr. Cooper spoke only of
the habits of deceased. Dr. Eichler, describing the
wound, said that the temporal artery and part of
the maxillary artery were torn, and that the
temporal bone was fractured. The other witnesses
testified to the manner in which the occurrence
bad taken place. Mrs. Kinder, Mr. Kinder, and
Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand were, it appeared, in one
room about six o’clock In the evening. The ladles
were sewing near the window. Mr. Kinder sat on
a chair near the door, and Mr. Bertrand farther
over in the i oom. A few words passed concerning
some letters which hrd arrived demanding money
—one from the New Zealand Bank asked for pay-
ment ot £l2O. Mr. Kinder was troubled. He left
the room and returned In a few minutes. The
ladles’ heads were down, hut Mr. Bertrand, look-
ing towards Mr. Kinder, saw a pistol in his right
band, the muzzle of it beirg against the right side
of his bead near the ear. A Joud report followed.
The ladies ran screaming cut of the room. The
pistol fell, hut a pipe Kinder had been smoking
remained in his mouth. The ladles returned.
Kinder sat on tie chair with blood flowing frem
the right side of his head. Scon he fell from the
chair, and Mr. Bertrand ran tor a doctor, leaving
Mrs. Kinder holding up her husband’s bead. Ber-
trand did net find a doctor, but In consequence of a
messageheleftDr. Eicblercame uplateinthenight.
Kinder lingered fer four days, during which time
Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand remained in the house, the
former dressing and undressing the wound of the
dying man, and the latter and Mrs. Kinder doing
ail they could to assist. This was the evidence
laid before the coroner’s jury in Lind’s Hotel, and
the following verdict was immediately returned:—
"Deceased died from the effects of a wcund in-
flicted by himself by discharging a pistol loaded
with powder, whilst labouring under a fit of tem-
porary insanity.”
Chapter IL—Tongue and Pen.
The grave closed on the dead. But an indefin-
able lean took hold of the public mind. There
was a terror in the air. Kinder’s bcuse was broken
up. His wife, with her two children, had gone to

her mother in Bathurst. The Bertrands bad come
back to No. 7, Wynyard Square. But a sense ot
unrest spread through all. It was as if a ghost
were afoot. Thoughts went back to the man sit-
ting in the chair in the room at North Shore with
a four Inch wound from his ear to his temple,
a pipe “ still in his mouth,” and a letter demanding
£l2O in his hand.
One day a letter from Francis Arthur Jackson
was delivered at No. 7, Wjnjard Square. Jack-
son bad known the Kinders when they were in
New Zealand. He had been a member of their
household, and had been criminally Intimate with
Mrs. Kinder. The intimacy was renewed after-
wards at North Shore. When the acquaintance
with the Bertrands sprang up, the lady translerred
her affections item Jackson to Bertrand. Jackson
was now in West Maitland, and, on reading an ac-
count of Klncer’s death, he wrote a letter to his
successlul rival. The following are passages of
it: —
“ I am shocked, horrified, astounded, at the
denouement of your plans. . . . I little thought
when you told me not to be surprised at anything
after my departure that it would end in this.
. . . Had the jury known one-half that I could
tell them, this would ring through the whclfe of
the civilised world. ... I would not stand in
your shoes at this moment for all the wealth,
rank, riches, and beauty it is in the power of the
world to bestow. As lor the accomplice and ac-
cessory, I pity as muchss blame her.”
Jackson wound up by demanding £2O to carry
him away to some other land, as he “could not
remain in a country where such a fearful tragedy
was enacted.” He had, however, to stay in the
country, for Bertrand, professing spotlessness of
conscience, put the letter in the hands of the
police, and, convicting Jackson on a charge of
trying to extort money, had him sent to Darling-
hurst Gaol for twelve months.
But this trial made the public interest greater.
The ghost of Kinder rose more boldly into the
noise of daylight. There were trouble, anxiety,
vexation, around the riddle. Wherever there is
ah atmosphere charged with grave inquiry there
will be persons who, urged by the influence of
subtle currents, will drop what knowledge they
possess in answer. The words may do them harm,
but unless their self-control is great they will drop
th em when tapped hy the silent and imperceptible
ir fluences among which they move. Ask them in
years after why they spoke. They will say, show-
ing the marks which the irons have left on them
for the speech, that they must have been fools at
the time. It was not they, however, who were
different, but the atmosphere. The silent, imper-
ceptible, inaudible vibration of mind to mind on
that particular subject existed then and not in the
years after.
So it happened that Bertrand loosed bis tongue.
His sister Harriet, who bad married a Melbourne
civil servant, came to Wynyard-rquare on a visit.
Her brother gave his secrets to her. He told her
he loved Mrs. Kinder, and was determined to bring
her from Bathurst and make her his wife. He told
her he would get adivorce from his prefent wife,
although he bad no special fault to charge against
her during bis three years of married Jife. The
thought of his two children did not move him.
He waxed more confidential. He entered her
bedroom one morning and seating her on the side
of the bed he sat down beside her and said; “I
have k metblng to tell you.” He said, "Kinder
did not shoot himself—l shot him.” She put her
hands up to her face and began to cry. He said,
“ Don’t cry, I don’t regie t w bat I have done.” He
went on then to declare that Kinder was in his
way, and that he would do the same thing to any
man who stood in bis way. As she cried, be went
into detail. He said that when he bad shctKinder
he put the pistol in bis band and the pipe Id bis
mouth. He warned her to say nothing to Mrs.
Bertrand,
Then ihe murderer loosed his tongue oncemore.
He said to his sister, “ I must marry Mrs. Kinder.
I canr ot give her up. 1 know she is a bad woman,
but that is why 1 must marry her. I will make a
second Lucretia of her.” He leaned over his
sister and said, * Kinder did not die Iby the
shot. H e poisoned him. She,” pointing to
his wife who was lying asleep on the sofa,
“gave him poison. The poison will nqyer
he discovered. I have enough poison in the
bouse to kill half the people in Sydney.” As if to
she w that this was no vain boast, ard to prove his
irflexibility be soon created a situation. He
argued with bis wife. He had, according to bis
sister’s statement, attempted to murder her a
short time nefore. On this occasion he came
home at 1 o’clock in the morning. He told his
wife she must die. Be took up a stick with a sling
at the tnd called a life-preserver, and said he
wanted to measure tbe exact spot where her brain
was, so that he could kill her with one blow. She
said, “Don’t kill me; you promised on your word
of honor thatycu would not kill me. He raised
the stick to strike. The sister rusbed in. She
pleaded for his mother’s, for his children's, for
every sake to forbear. He ordered her out. When
she left he shut the door. Then she heard him say
to his wife, “Now, Jane, I want you to go into the
surgery, to write on this piece of paper that you
are tired of your life, and that you poisoned your-
self by your own hand.” She heard her say, “No.
You may pour the poison down my throat, but I
will not write anything.”
But he loosed his tongue again. In the dentist’s
workshop, in No. 7 Wynyard-square, two men
stand face to face. A low light burns before
them.
They are both young. Who are they?
Lock at them. Did we not see them looking
thus into each other’s face before? On the nights
the city was silent, did not these two men pass
down the street and make to the wharf ? Are not
these they who, with the moon shining down on
the silver-crested waves, rowed silently over the
waters to North Bhore ? Are not these they who
stopped before the house of Henry Kinder ? Look
at the elder. Is not that the man who took off his
boots and climbed through the window? is not
that the man who wore the Crimean shirt and
carried the tomahawk ? It is. He and Henry
Louis Bertrand, the dentist of Wynyard-square,
are one; and the man facing him, the man who
held his boots, the man who bought the hatchet,
the man who bought the pistols, the man who
bought the Crimean shirt, is Albert Broad,
assistant in the shop. Nameless shadows so long,
they now, named, stand face to face, and each
knows how far the other has gone.
One sentence is enough between them. Henry
Kinder is dead I They look at one another. Each
summons up the past. There is silence. Each
knows.
The pen is also answering. Love is loud-voiced,
however two may try to keep it down. The
widow of the dead man is in Bathurst. That is
far away from her illicit Inver. Her lover is *n No
7. Wynyard-square. She bad eeaeed to love Henry
Kinder. Whatever about the past, and so far as she
saw in the future, Henry Louis Bertrand answered
totte bell which passion rarg in the chambers
of her heirg. It was little wonder. He wrote to
her as a goddess. she wrote to him as a god. That,
if sincere, is Love. Bertrand, though a murderer,
Mrs. Kinder though an adulteress, had, if their
statements at this stage are to be taken as true,
risen to a plane on which there is no room for
those who live ard marry and fatten and die by
law. There is such a plane in existence. It is
high, with breezes of its own, and suns and stars
of ifs own. Few lives rise to it.
From Bathurst, within a month from her hus-
band’s death, she wrote to Bertrand, at Wynyard-
square—"Ob, darling. If you could know how my
heart was aching tor a word of lore from you.
Dear, desr love, your kind lovlrg words seem to
fill a void in my heart. I was tormenting myself
with all sorts darling. Write very
often—every day if you can-and 1 will be here to
answer. ’ In answer to Bertrand's proposal that he
shouldgeta divorce from hiswife, she says: “You
msynotbe able to accomplish your purpose on
account of the expense, but I must not give wav
to thoughts of this kind.” She writes: “Do bear
me up, my own love, and hope for better days. I
tell yon this when my own heart is sinking with
fears for the future, Love y. Lovey, if we could
see each other occasionally it would be some com-
fort, but weary watching is terrible.” She goes
on: “ There is little or no prcspect here for the
future. I would try and get a situation in some
house in Sydney. Here there is no such thing to
be had. However, we must hope for the best. I
suppose you would not be asht med of our poor
home were you to come up, love; but I know It
will make no cifference to you. If I lived in a
shanty It would be all the sane, would it not?”
She breaks out: “ A glimpse of you, oh, dearest
dearestl What would I not give to be taken to
your heart, if only for a moment? . . . Your
love is food and nourishment to me. I cannot do
without it. ... I believe, darling, that if our
f eparation is for long I shall go out of my mind I
cannot live without seeing you sometimes. .
Howls Jane ” (Bertrand s wife?) “It is no use*
saying lam grieved at her being laid up. That
would be a mere farce between you and me.”
Later on she writes: “I kiss you every night
dear one, before sleeping. God bless you, and let
me dream of you. 1 ciy oh, oh, off my heart, and
ache to see you.” Again she writes: “Oh, dar-
ling, darling, if I could only but see the old sur-
gery there, and leaning my head against yours, as
1 have so often done, tell you all and everything—
what a comfort it would be to me I” Again: “Oh
love, the thought that I might be an easier dis-
tance off you makes me wild with pleasure. Dear
dear one, I place everything under your own
judgment,” This cry of hers has meaning; “ Oh,
dear, dear love, what can you mean about
mamma’s secret ? I know of r one. Do, c'o tell
me. Darling, that must be some mistake. Oh my
love, have pity, and tell me.” Again: “ Ob, if I
could only be a true Christian, but my thoughts
and desires are so terribly wicked. lam myself
terrified at them. ... I do not know how I
shall feel when I see your dear face again. The
thought sets my breast beatiig and ihe blood
gurgling in my veils. . . . Mamma gave me
a regular lecture to-day. I knew she would see
through us. 1 told mamma plain out I cared for
you and you me. . . . With regard to my own
heart’s feelings there is no one else in the wide
world to whom I can talk to as you. Love, love,
you ask me to say I love you. Dear darling, ,t is
born in sorrow and trouble, therefore all the
stronger; my heart and mind ache with thesti ength
of my love Love you ? Oh, yes; belter than
anything in this wide, wide world.”
There is eloquence in this woman. Men are poor
things in self-sacrifice, in affection, in love. Men
think of many things, and seldom rise above
mediocrity in any of them. Woman thinks of one
thing, ana on that is heroically strong. Criminal
as Mrs. Kinder was in many respects, she yet was
a woman with capacity to rise. Her passion was
far from being a brute one Her conscience told
her that her acts were those ol the drabbled out
cast. In the mirror of life she saw berselfas a
pestilence, a plague. Yet conscience and mirror
combined did not make her throw away the love-
liness of womanly affection. Defiled, polluted she
still looked up. The face wts not the painted
one of brazen evil. It was the face of hone of
longing, of yearning for the time when the love
now soiled would purlly itself. “ Let hardship and
adversity come,” she says “ I can bear any thin*
if only I can see your dear face ; if only at a dis-
tance sometimes. My heart has found its rest
Not all the world will alter it in thought or deed ”
Bertrand promises a meeting. She writes* “Oh
this meeting, love; oh, I shall go mad. It la too
delicious to dream of. Let it be in reality, darling •

when the boat was rowed to the wharf at North

Elliott searched No. 7 Wynyard-square, and in a

room he found the diary Bertrand had been writ-

manded Bertrand’s letters in reply, and, getting
none, searched the house. He d' ®l,® l , f
with which it was alleged Kinder kljQMelf.
Tongue and pen still worked. Warranty were
issued for the arrest of Maria Helen Kinder,
Henry Louis Bertrand, and Jane Bertrand, and on
Monday, the 4th of December, 1865, they.were put
on their trial in the Water Police Court, Sydney,
charged with the murder of Henry Kinder.
Chapter 111.-The Wages oe Sin.
The case in the Water
Police Court lasted a
week. Mr. Butler ap-
peared for the Crown,
and Messrs. Roberts and
Robberds for the accused.
As the evidence pro-
ceeded, it became clear
that neither of the women
participated directly in
causing the death of
Kinder. Mrs. Kinder bad
taken th» story of the
death from Bertrand s
lips. She had not seen
the shot fired. But the
shot or the lingering
death of her husband did
not appear to pain her.
Harriet Kerr, Bertrand s
sister, heard from Mrs.
Bertrand that during the
days that intervened be-
tween the shooting and
death. Mis. Kinder and
Bertrand spent most of
the time in walking up
and down the verandah
with their arms around
each other’s waists. But
still she was Ignorant of
the actual fact alleged
against Bertrand. As for
Mrs. Bertrand, it was
shown that she was in
every sense a victim. She
was aware of her hus-
band’s crime but was
terrified into silence.
Accordingly, though
the three prisoners were
committed for trial, the
Attorney - General de-
clined to prosecute the
women. IFor Mrs. Ber-
trand there was intense
public sympathy. She had
only been three years
married and was now
barely 31 years of age.
Her married life had been
around of tortures. She
had been bruised, beaten,
and insulted systematic-
ally. Her husband had
been a fiend to her. Ac-
cording to the evidence
given by kia sister, Har-
riet, he had once stabbed
her. He had thrashed
her with Mrs. Kinder’s
whip until pieces of flesh
were torn oft her back
and shoulders. In other
respects he had behaved
monstrously. It was al-
leged, and was said to
have been admitted by
her, that she mixed the
poison which her hus-
band gave Kinder sab-
sequent to the shooting.
But everything bore out
the conclusion that in
presence of her husband
she had no free will. On
the other hand, the pub-
lic looked on Mrs. Kinder
with abhorrence. On the
23th of February. 1886,
she was brought before
the Court for discharge.
The Attorney - General
stated that he had no
case against her. The
court was crowded, and
a murmur of dissatisfac-
tion arose- She stood
in the dock, pale, tremb-
lirg. She was in her
thirtieth year, and was
dressed in deep mourn-
ing. The Chief-Justice
ordered her release, and
she stepped out into the
floor of the court. The
murmurs of dissatisfac-
tion grew louder. Bho
looked around, trembled,
tottered, and fell to the
floor in a faint. The crowd
showed signs of a wish to
maltreat her. and she was
taken back to the gaol for
protection.
Henry Louis Bertrand
thus stood alone in the
dock of the Central Crimi-
nal Court charged with
the murder of Henry
Kinder. Sir Alfred
Stephen, at that time
Chief Justice, occupied
the bench. Mr. W, B.
Dailey and Mr. Windeyer,
instructed by Mr. Rob-
erts, appeared for the
prisoner, and the Attor-
ney - General with Mr.
Butler for the Crown. The
prisoner looked a little
nervous when first placed
in the dock, but qulekly
composed himself and
smiled around the court
at such acquaintances as
he recognised. At seme
stages he Indulged in
what was almost levity.
He was carefully dressed in black taousers and
vesit and dark blue cloth sac coat. He held a
memorandum book in his hand and consulted it
from time to time as the case went on.
The evidence was voluminous. The theory of
the Crown was that the prisoner put a loaded
pistol into Kinder’s hand, not making known that
it was loaded, and either himself drew the trigger,
or caused Kinder to draw it, while the latter was
in a half-stupid stete from drink. The next point
urged was that Kinder began to recover from the
effects of the shot, and Ms death on the Friday
at ter was attributable to poison rubbed into the
wound by the prisoner or given t® him in drink at
the prisoner’s instance. The want of certainty as
to the actual cause of death burdened all the
pleadings.
A large number of witnesses gave evidence.
The medical testimony was not decisive. It con-
flicted on the leading points. Seeing that Kinder
had Improved between Monday and Thursday, Dr.
Bidder was unable to mention any visible cause
or matter of fact to whicih to attribute the death
on Friday. Mr. Charles Watt, analytical chemist,
who on the exhumation of Kinder’s remains
examined the stomach, found no traces of poison,
but did not consider it inconsistent with the result
of the analysis for poison of an organic nature to
have been administered. A long time had elapsed
l <-<ore the s+omacKws's tested, and it is sn estab-
llshed fact that some of the most active and
deadly poisons rapidly decompose, and are
after a certain time undetectable by analysis.
Not to find traces of poison in Kinder’s
case after the expiration of two months
was not, therefore, greatly in the prisoner’s
favour, as, especially, some of those rapidly de-
composing poisons were discovered in his pos-
session.
The bulk of the evidence consisted of statements
alleged to have been made by the prisoner himself
at various times and to various persons. His rela-
tions with Mrs. Kinder, both before and after the
tragedy, threw a white light on poislble motives.
His diary was put in. Mis. Kinder’s letters were
read. His sister Harriet gave Important particu-
lars. Mrs. Mary Agnes liobertson, a frequent
visitor at the Bertrands, revealed many damag-
ing confidences. Albert Broad’s testimony was
crushing.
Counsel for the prisoner had not much logo
upon. The cue taken by Mr. Dailey was practi-
cally to admit that the prisoner had said all he was
reported to have said. Mr. Dailey then argued that
his client was a miserable liar and vain tool, who,
to Inspire admiration or terror, would stop at
nothing. Hence, the wilder the tale of his threats or
achievements given by him to Albert Broad or
. Harriet Kerr, the more miserable a liar and the

The Middle Harbour Hermit.
A ROMANCE OF THE SYDNEY LAW COURTS.
more vain a fool Mr. Dailey would have the jury
to consider him.
A little irregularity arose at the close of the
defence which came up for consideration after.
Mr. Butler insisted on his right to address the jury
in reply. After objection, he was allowed to do so.
The jury retired. They were brought Into court
several times. Bach time the foreman announced
that there was no likelihood of agreement. After
23 hours the Chief Justice discharged them, and
the prisoner was remanded.
He was placed in the dock again on the 2lst of
February. Again Mr. Butler appeared for the
Crown, and Mr. Dailey for the prisoner. The pro-
secution and the defence kept to the former
lines. The Chief Justice, by permission of counsel,
with the view of shortening the proceedings, read
the medical evidence instead of putting the wit-
nesses a second time in the box. The jury retired
at 6 o’clock in the evening and returned at 8 with
a verdict of guilty.
Bertrand showed no agitation. He addressed
the Court in a clear, calm voice. The speech was
short, but in style and sentiment it was well-pro-
portioned and steady. He claimed that Kinder
had committed suicide, and that monetary diffi-
culties were sufficiently grave with him to supply
a motive for tbe act. He complained that the
Crown had not trotted this part of the case with
the lt deserved. He alleged tbat his sister
Harriet had perjured herself, and declared the
diary that had been put in evidence was written
by him solely to befool Mrs. Kinder. He
solemnly asserted that be was not serious
when writing it. He next adverted to the
judge having read a portion of the evidence given
at a former trial irstead of calling the witnesses
before the Court. Be complained that this was
unfair and that he bad not assented to it. For the
rest, he was grateful to his counsel, and believed
the jury had acted to the best of their ability.
Sir Alfred Stephen passed on him the sentence of
death.
But there were people afoot outside. Bertrand
bad friends in Melbourne, in Queensland, in
Sydney. They drew together. They had money.
They recognised the irregularities referred to
above. They determined to fight for him. They
appealed on his behalf to the Privy Council. They
appealed to the Pull Court on questions of prac-
tice. It was held that a subject of the Queen in a
British dependency had a right to appeal to ihe
supreme tribunal of the realm in a case of life and
death. That right is still possessed bv subjects in
Canada, as was recently Illustrated in the case of
Riel, the revolutionist. Subjects in Bombay and
elsewhere also possess the right. A similar right
is in force for Frenchmen in New Caledonia. The
local court may sentence a man to death, but the
sentence cannot be carried into execution until the
fiat comes from France.
In Bertrand’s case the appeal to the Privy
Council failed, the reading of the Constitution
Act being that plenary power lay with the New
South Wales Executive. But before the Supreme
Court there was a vigorous battle over two points
In Sir Alfred Stepoen’s judicial conduct. Bertrand
insisted that his assent had not been given to the
reading of the evidence. Mr. Julian Salomons,
who had succeeded Mr. Dailey in the defence of
Bertrand, maintained that the discharge of the
jury in the first trial was bad. Tnere was no
medical examination to show that any member of
the jury was incapacitated for duty, and Mr.
Salomons argued that, had not the judge dismissed
them, their verdict might have been different to
that brought in by the second jury. He Illustrated
his contention. In the first trial the jury had
spent 31 or 33 hours in consultation and had not
come to a decision. In the second trial the jury
had found a verdict in two hours. According to
Mr. Salomons, there was as much likelihood that
the verdict of the first jury would be in favour of,
as there was that it would be against, Bertrand.
He, therefore, drove home the point that that
jury, had they been been kept at it, would have
fulfilled the ends of law. But he contended that
they had been interfered with. The Chief Justice
had discharged them on grounds that did not
justify the discharge. The foreman!of the jury
esid that the jury could net agree. But cases were
cited in which juries that had held out longer
came to a unanimous verdict. The point was:
was any member of this Jury unfit to go on? A
member of the jury stated his willingness to
sw ear that he was seriously unwell. But the point
was: was he, or any other, in the eye of the law
unfit to go on ? Did the Judge get medical
evidence ? Without this, could not a Judge dismiss
a jury after one hour as effectually as after 21 ?
The result was that a third trial was ordered.
A verdict of “Guilty” was again returned.
Sentence of death was again passed, but the Ex-
ecutive Council, looking before and after, com-
muted the sentence to Imprisonment for life in a
lunatic asylum.
While they were quarrelling about him in the
courts of law, Bertrand bad become, even to those
who make no study of human character, actually
mad. He was forthwith sent to Parramatta
Lunatic Asylum,
There was at that time, in Parramatta, a medical
man who took great interest in following up such
evidences of mental aberration as Bertrand dis-
played. This was Dr. Taylor. He studied the
case through. Congenial occupation was his
panacea for a mind diseased. Bertrand was an
amateur artist. In the letters to his sweetheart
he had described much of
bis work in this dlrec-
tion. He was preparing
some things for the forth-
coming Melbourne Exhi-
bition. He was maturing
designs of various kinds.
He had in his mind “a
naked figure of a Fijian
kneeling, holding a pearl-
shell, which is shaped like
a basket, over his head.
From this shell, droop
bunches of sea-weed. ”Dr.
Taylor thought that this
faculty might be directed
Into a channel which,
without doing high art
any harm, might soothe-
a mind diseased. He
therefore encouraged
Bertrand. Various paint-
ings were the result. The
matter was brought
under Mr. Harold Mac-
lean the N.B.W. Comp-
troller-General of Pri-
sons. This gentleman ap-
proved of Hr Taylor’s
® n J he l7th August,
18T5, Bertrana was taken
« ow P ml Garllnghurst

ped out by Dr. Taylor
appeared to have a good
result. Mr. Maclean per-
mitted the art-work to

prisoner, wrs appointed
to assist the surgeon and
dispenser during the day,
but in intervals there
was time on his bands,
and he was permitted
to employ these intervals

for most of the mechan-
ic* 1 expense. In one case
the K.C. Church sup-
plied canvas, brushes, and
Paint. Bertrand set to.
.Those who appointed
the North Shore shooter
and poisoner to the gaol
hospital must have for-
gotten, or could have
never read, the story of
Thomas Griffiths Waln-
wright, who wrote criti-
cisms (admired by Charles
and Hazlitt) in
the London Magazine—
who painted most artis-
tically, and poisoned alike
grey - haired men and
young and beautiful girls
whose lives he had in-
sured. Wainwrlght, too,
was, after his transpor-
tation to Van Diemen’s>
Land, a disperser —at
Hobart Gaol. One day
he was told to watch la-
the prison hospital beside
the bed of a sick pri-
soner against whom he
had a grudge. Waln-
w right’s snakish eyes kin-
dled with unearthly fire..
He was soon alone with
his enemy and patient:;
“In 12 hours”—he leant
down and hissed—" in
12 hours you will be in
hell, and I”—rolling up his
shirt - sleeves—" shall be
up to my elbows dissecting
you.” The recollection cf
that grim story should
have ensured Bertrand’s
being kept away from,
the drugs.
Twenty-four paintings*
of Bertrand’s now hang
within the walls of Dar-
llughurst Gaol. Some of
them are located In the
store-room, and the re-
mainder are distributed
throug h the clerks’ offices.
Mr. Bead, the governor
of the gaol, appears to
have a paternal interest
in the fame of the ama-
teur. Ho helped fre-
quently in choosing hie
colours. He sits down
before Bertrand’s " Bt.
Andrew’s Cathedral ” or
his “Bockot Ages,’’and
draws attention to what
is best, and says nothing
about what is bad in the
canvas before him. He
knows what be is talking
about. Grave faults in
art he has no pardon
for. But he thinks, and
thinks humanly, that
there is merit in some of
Bertrand’s work. Ber-
trand worked largely from
photographs. He applied
colours to the tracings
of Landseer, Leslie, and
others. But he had special
gifts. They did not urge
him to original concep-
tions, but to special ways of treating conceptions
already expressed. His “Blaine,” just starts the
idea the name denotes. His "Saved from the
Wreck”is a conception. Muscles are, however,
knotted and contorted in a way that reminds one
of the drawings of an anatomical student whose
aim is not art but surgery. The " Bottle-Tree ” is
green where no bottle-tree was ever green; and
" Autumn ”is wearying and saddening. Amongst
other things, Bertrand has Imperfectly copied
“The Lion’s Bride.” “St. Andrew’s Cathedral”
gives a very good idea of the murderer’s skill. It
is more than a fair reproduction of a good photo-
graph. Imagination is displayed in his painting
of “The Gap.” The towering cliffs are seen as
they stand to-day at South Head. The ship rocks
in the open. One looks more than once at this
canvas. But it is obtruded on one all along that
none of the paintings would give Bertrand a
reputation as a cultured artist.
Bertrand maintains that these 34 paintings are
his own private property. The paint, the
brushes, the canvas, were supplied from
outside. About one a painting of the
Crucifixion—there is some dispute. This was
hung up for some time in the chaoel of the gaol
where the Roman Catholics worshipped. It is a
telling portrait. The muscles of the lower limbs
are rather abnormally drawn, but the general ex-
pression is powerful and effective. It was


SUPPLEMENT TO “THE BULLETIN,” SIDNEY, N.S.W., SATURDAY, AUGUST 7, 1886,




laated to Bertrand that the Roman Catholics,
rhsrein they supplied the materials, claimed legal
ights over the painting. This claim he to the
iresent day rejects. But the remaining pictures
Jsrtr ind’s mother has practically acquired, bhe
3 Influentially supported. Mr. Read is willing that
he paintings should go; Mr. Maclean is not averse,
t would appear that if Bertrand will go quietly
ibroad into the world and will take his pictures
vith him, no questions will be raised by anyone.
It Is a paltry thing to raise the question of btate
>roperty in prison work. All the time of a
jrisoner’s work is the State's. But while Bertrand
yas an amateur artist he was disroaser, or assist-
mt dispenser, or worked about at something,
n the gaol hospital. He did the work set
ipart for him. His srt efforts were really
10 more than the idle turn spent between
job and job. _
Bertrand's friends kept ever working. Every
jhange of Ministry these 30 years incited a new
ippeal. It was thought that if the man
iould obtain release and fly to another lard some
,ight would fall on his life. To that end his friends
worked. Year followed year, however, and no
release came. „ „ .
At the present time the Executive Council of
N.S.W, have the case in hand. They consider
whether Henry Louis Bertrand, now confined in
Maitland gao', should be agaia admitted to the
rights and privileges of a free citizen. Whatever
the decision, the outlook is serious. Is the loaded
mind of the little, vigorous, captious, envious,
ciiminal to be kept for ever within walls? Twenty
years are almost a-thlrd of the psalmist's life. If
he is befreed he will look a different being to
what he was 30 years ago. Then a slight, beardless
youth, he is now a stout, more than middle-aged
man with luxuriant whiskers tinged by grey. Ber-
trand will, if released, see a different world. He
will meet a sister who never ceased to work in his
Interest, and. what may perhaps supply him with
philosophy for a new career, he will learn that

he leading politicians there la a man who never
old a lie, and one who never, within the memory
>f his oldest friend, was ever known to stumble
ipon the truth. Several Scottish squatters in the
jommunity have been known to form themselves
nto an association for the purpose of offering a
oan of money to an impecunious farmers’ friend,
ivhlch loan was not to be returned until the plea-
mre of the recipient, and interest was positively
refused. Latterly some good people have had the
audacity to form themselves into an alliance for
logging the footsteps of their neighbours, count-
ing the number of glasses of lager-beer which they
drink after business hours, and informing their
employers of the nature of the company which
they keep. It is to Adelaide that Sydney
owes the Rev. Dr. Jefferis. He tore himself
away from a sorrowing South Australian
congregation because he felt that Pltt-street'
Sydney, was his particular locality in the Loard’s
vineyard. The B.A. taxpayers are just now defray-
ing the board and lodging of a late enthusiastic
secretary totheYoung Men's Christian Association,
and several musical financiers have been added,
to the stone-breaking gang. Sacred opera is now
one of the possibilities of gaol life in the vicinity
of the Torrens. The last curiosity is, however
worth two or three ordinaries rolled into one-no
less than an Independent minister prepared to
explain away the story of the Israelites crossing
the Red Sea by showing that the company which
Moses led never were near the Red Sea at all. but
only waded across a puddle in which the waters
became very low during high winds. If it had
been anyone else but the Rev. Roby Fletcher who
started to rub out the inexplicable in the sacred
writings of Moses, we should at once feel inclined
to say “wade in;” but we cannot help dropping
a tear for those saints of his keeping who
are having their feelings outraged by this invasion
of a region where so many cherished beliefs have
long existed without being knocked over. Now
that the Rev. Roby has started upon his unholy
war, what will he say about the wonderful history
of Jonah’s rapid journey on board the whale, and
the careful way in which he was deposited on the
sea coast without being charged even 5 per cent.
ad valorem ? Tin's and many other incidents which
the good people who sit at the feet of the Fletcher
Gamaliel have long believed, will be cut to ribbons
if the rev. gentleman insists on explaining them,
as he has done the passage of the Rsd Sea. With
the enormous accumulation of faith amongst the
saints of the South Australian capital—faith which
has not even been crushed out by the vagaries of
religious embezzlers—we should have looked upon
Adelaide as the last place, and Roby Fletcher as I
about the last man to have refused to swallow
such a trifling improbability as that to which re-
ference has been made. The orthodox will have
to dredge up a chariot-wheel or two before the
difficulty will be flashy set at rest ?
“Editor Bulletin, —Sir—AsN.B.W. coun-
try hospitals are at present conducted, they are
exclusively for the benefit of townspeople, loafers,
and anyone that the neighbouring' squatter may
send. The unfortunate swagman who has sub-
scribed at every shed he has been at, can t get
admittance unless he goes for a ticket to .some
storekeeper, who, having to study , civility in his
business, often does not forget to show his inso-
lence to the sick man-out of whom nothing is to
be got so far as this world is concerned. Tne first
ouery generally Is— ‘ Why don’t you stay in your
own district?’ As though an Australian swag-
man had a district or parish like the English land-
lord’s serf. No. 3—‘What have you done with
your money?’—the whole Insolent catechism
winding up with—’ There are too many calls upon
my charity;’ said charity, most likely, consisting
of a sovereign or so subscribed annually. If a
swagman really is possessed of money, and wants
to enter as a paying patient, there does not appear
to be any way of getting into a hospital without
‘ crawling ’ and grovelling before those in
authority. My idea for a remedy is, that tickets
should be issued, charge IQs. or more per annum,
said tickets admitting bearer to any hospital re-
ceiving Government aid, the hospital receiving
the money to suffer the expense should the appli-
cation be made at any other hospital. This is
not a new idea, but I don’t remember seeing you
work it up, and I am sure that if practicable, it
would be of immense benefit to the worklpg-meQ

Our folks are unpolished andrude,
Quite lacking in family pride—
’Tis seldom we find ’em imbued
With delicate notions of “ side;”
In street, or in train, or in tram,
They couldn’t be easily classed
By the subtle distinctions in 41 jam,”
Which constitute 44 circles ” and 44 caste.”
Now, a workman is decent enough,
But hardly the equal in rank
Of a squatter with plenty of 44 stuff,"
Or a junior clerk in a hank;
And unless sharp distinctions are made
(Which hasn't been done in the past)
’Twixt labour, profession, and trade—
Oh I how shall we manage for 44 caste ? ”
Then let us take heed and make haste
To cultivate 41 swells ” of our own,
Who will cherish these traditions of taste
Which give a society 44 tone;”
Once good as his master was Jack,
But the day for equality’s past-
’Tis time we were changing our tack,
And standing (like Hindoos) on 44 caste.”
In the future how nice it will be,’
When people no longer are mixed,
When Jenkins is careful to see
That Robinson's status is fixed;
Then, as in worlds tbat are old,
We'll bow to our betters at last—
Mere worth shall be nowhere, hut gold
Will settle the question of 44 caste.”
A CHARITABLE INSTITUTION.
For your blood is surely poisoned,
And so deadly is the taint
That you're here, perchance, one morning,
And, to-morrow, here you ain’t.
“ When some nasty broken chilblains
Give you trouble with your toes,
Ohl we take your leg, and, presto!
In a moment off it goes.
It is getting on quite nicely,
Is that amputated pin,
When, as certain as the sunrise,
E rysipelas sets in.
“ Then walk into our death-trap—
Harry, Tammy, Johnny, Bob—
We have Instruments in plenty
And are always on the job;
’Tls the very surest death-trap
That the world has ever seen.
Make your wills and have a shake-down
In our special ward-eighteen.”
Ah! the widow mourns a husband,
Stricken down in manhood’s prime—
The mother mourns her loved one
Done to death before his time;
They are poor, and who shall heed them ?
None will hearken to their cries,
The rich man shrugs his shoulders
As each poisoned victim dies.
A MOST DESERVING CASE.
Ye sycophants of Sydney who have feathered well
your nests,
And cherish love of Royalty in grovel-eaten
breasts,
Here Is an opportunity you’ve long been looking
for
To lavish gold and silver on the idol you adore.
An object for your pity is the Monarch’s eldest
son;
He has never been rewarded for the good which
be has done
In the service of his country, for he gets no other
pay
Than the very paltry pittance of a thousand
pounds a day.
For years he has been toiling-oh, a scandal and
disgrace I—
And none have drawn attention to this most “ de-
serving case
The son of widowed mother, Heir Apparent to the
throne—
With scarce a blessed shilling he could fairly call
his own.
While philanthropists were feigning to “ do some-
thing ” for the poor,
They left no broken vittles at this royal pauper’s
door;
Nor, mingled with the cry of Outcast London,
have they heard
The Bitter Cry of Bertie-for he didn’t say a word.
Never weary in well-doing, still His Highness
pegged away
(With nothing to support him but a thousand
pounds a day);
He opened Exhibitions and did other jobs like
that—
And scorned to crown his labours by a-taklng
round the hat.
But better late than never, some one (blessings'on
bis name I
We don’t know who began it, but we love him all
the same)
Has started a subscription for this poor neglected
elf
Who worked so hard for England and got nothing
for himself.
So, sycophants of Sydney, who have feathered
well your nests,
And cherish love of royalty in grovel-eaten
breasts,
Here is an opportunity you’ve long been looking
for
To lavish gold and silver on the idol you adore.
Dip deep into your coffers, of your substance
freely give—
It is on such as you that such as Bertie ought to
live.
Don’t ask for our subscription, we are somewhat
short of pelf—
Though really we would like to glv? him some-
thing for himself.

“Nap,” at the Sydney Gaiety, on Satur-
day night, turned out to be one of the wildest
absurdities ever perpetrated outside Parliament
or the lunatic asylum. The author, fortunately,
has not attempted "to hold the mirror up to
Nature,” and we were decidedly grateful for his
forbearance, for Nature, under these circum-
stances, is generally reflected as a tight-laced
female, with six broken ribs, no gizzard worth
swearing by, and a blue wart on her mythological
nose But, regarded as a healthy antidote to a
sermon, or as a means of saviog the i «o of a
patient who is suffering from Jawbone A i don
the brain, ” Nap ” deserved a better house and
better fortune. It contained some valuable hints
to impecunious gentlemen with limited ward-
robes, and, compared with the rawboned agonbs
which have become so popular in Sydney, it might
really have been a little worse—not much.
♦ » »
Timothy Mudd, of Mud Springs Hotel,
opened the performance. He is a gentleman of
the chirpy, bull-frog persuasion, and is more chirpy
than usual owing to the expected arrival of Lord
Lovill, a nobleman of the aide-de-koeg order,
Who had lost his brains and is travelling
in search of them. In lieu of the mule-headed
aristocrat, however, atrive Napclaon Jinks
and H, N. Brown, two broken-down actors,
Who have left their company in the lurch and
traversed a good many miles of scenery in their
anxiety to keep a little way in front of a bailiff,
while the man with the writ and the Hebrew tose
has also been exerting himself for fear he should
be left it little behind the flying dramatists. Jinks
in his hasty retreat has quitted the scene of his
triumphs in tights, and saved nothing but the
wreck of a theatrical wardrobe. These gentlemen
having, by means of a stolen letter, ascertained
that the nobleman is not coming, resolve to per-
sonate him and his attendant, and while Brown
explains that his lordship is very eccentric in his
dress and manner, his colleague retires behind a
twig and artayes hia:self as best he can for the oc-
casion. His attire consists chiefly of a kilt and a
pair of legs* and unfortunately there is more of leg
than kilti but his title covers any little deficiencies
In the tailoring department, and for a few hours
N. Jinks frisks among victuals and expensive lush
with the joyous abandon of a red-headed elephant
on an African bust. He paralyses the ladles
by his elegance and courtesy, and strikes cork-
shrew attitudes with his amazing shanks on his
introduction to Matilda Mudd and other members
of the party. But unluckily he is recognised by
the stage-struck servant girl—a former sweet-
heart—who makes things unpleasant during the
banquet, and even the liquor dispensed by a French
waiter in striped stockings (who dances about
with the frantic vigour of a hungry mosquito)
cannot restore the happiness of the half-naked
peer. Finally the girl grows incensed when she
sees that the soi dimnt nobleman exhibits the
place where his stockings ought to be for other
fond eyes than hers to gtiza upon, and, after keep-
ing up the imposture bravely under exceedingly
adverse circumstances, Jinks is bowled out by the
treacherous Sarah, and the scene closes with a
wild scrimmage that looks like a fight between
Foley’s gang and a windmill In kilts. The last
glimpse before the fall of the curtain shows a
Highland costume and a perfect whirlwind of legs
going down on the stage, with an avalauche of
Mudd on top, and vice is evidently played out
once more. v

“Left,” an Eccentric Sketch by Messrs.
■Walsh and King, and “Tae Two Orphans in Hard
Luck,” closed the performance, but owing
to circumstances over which the police had
no control, we retired just as the two favourite
comedians were entering upon a serpentine frenzy
of high-kicking, and the applause of the gratified
audience followed us into tne slushy outer world.
• • •
Mr. Sheridan, as the unclothed Jinks, took
most of the honours, and the easy grace with
which he acted the part of a nobleman, without
trousers, showed that humanity is not entirely of
tailor-made origin. It is certainly degrading to
suppose that the fluff which is skimmed off the
top of the sheep, and afterwards woven into
cloth, is essential to human dignity; but Mr.
Sheridan dispelled this old delusion, and proved
that a lord, so long as his legs are made of meat
and not of wood, and ho has at least one garment
to wear above them, is every inch a man. Mr.
Knight Aston, Messrs. Walsh and King, and
Misses Livingstone, Fraser, and Sophie Harris,
gave some excellent songs; and the former lady
tried to make a success as Sarah Walker. Mr.
Lester was also very good as Brown alias Boodle;
and Ala has not broken his neck yet. Wnen ho
does we will go to the funeral.

Raynor Brothers form the principal at-
traction at Sydney Academy this week, and so
long as their engagement continues, there will be
good houses at the Federal Minstrels. As they
appear on the stage they are two tall, solemn-
looking individuals, as gaunt as an Australian
boarding-house and buttoned up to the verge of
desperation, and they expend more good jokes lu
half an hour than an average performer can think
of between the time he paid his last washing-bill
and the date when he is unable to liquidate the
next one. As musicians they are first-class, but
while one plays the violin by holding the bow be-
tween his knees and bumping the instrument
against it, the other extracts excellent melody by
swinging a concertina through the atmosphere
with his right hand while he tries to pick his com-
panion's pocket with the left. The pocket, how-
ever, proves to he empty. They carry on (their
concert, too, in all manner of unexpected atti-
tudes, and sit in impossible positions on furniture
which is not there, winding up at last with a cat a
duet, which sounds startingly like the wail of a
crew of blighted felines and which ends in a clawing
match. After this performance the dynamite scare,
which concludes the evening, seems as flat as
yesterday’s uncorked beer. It purports to have
been written expressly for the Faderals, a circum-
stance which leads us to tender these gent’emen
our sincere sympathy, for if such a thing had been
written for us we would have been compelled to
lay out the author among the assorted poets in the
cellar. Most of these poets, we may mention, are
now dead The chief feature is Grim Death Bill,
a mysterious American with a mysterious joke,
who takes out the side wall and roof with an
infernal machine, and such an individual should
not be permitted to be at large in a civilised com-
munity. The singing is up to the usual high
standard, and we can only object to the ” Concert
Jubilee” on the ground that this continent is
already stuffed with too much jubilee, and until
the Queen celebrates her IJTtti birthday we don’t
really want to j abilate any more.
“ Voices of the Night,” a melo- dramatic
skeleton divided into six gaily-painted bones, is
still running at the Sydney Royal Standard. The
“ voices ” are of all kinds—groggy voices, husky
voices, beery voices, voices with their back hair
in wild disorder, voices that have not washed
themselves for a fortnight, and voices that are
suggestive of a parrot ordering a tripe and onion
supper from underneath six feather beds. The
voices are in partnership, too, with all kinds of
human breath, not always of the most cow-like,
hut apparently the audience are satisfied, and that
is the principal thing In this world. The lobster
still continues to climb into pl&ces where no
rational lobster has any right to go, and the ser-
pent is as lively as if he had a hot coal tied to his
tail. So long as the tree-climbing fish and his
coadjutor can keep on their legs, or rather on the
place where their legs should be, the piece will
probably be a success, and if the author could only
introduce a desperate combat between a peri-
winkle and an oyster it would be an additional
attraction of no mean order.
« « « «
Almost everyone has some idea of the
sufferings of a Parliamentary candidate.
A flt example of human woes;
Early ne came* and late he goes.
He grebts the mother with courtly grace,
He kisses the baby's dirty face,
and then he mutters, “ Confound the old woman
and her brat,” as he retire* in disgust. “ The Can-
didate,” at Sydney Opera House, however, has
even a worre experience than the average, being
weighed down by his mother-in-law, and by a
truly horrible missionary, who is perpetually
stretching his large cold feet in the drawing-room
at Oldacre House. This individual suffers from a
rush of ffesh to the stomach, and when he leans
back In his favourite attitude, in an easy chair, his
pedal extremities loom up and obscure one side
of the apartment. The fiat-footed apostle, too, is
always putting his boots In high places, as if to
call attention to the fact that they enclose the
hoofs of an evangelist. As to the mother-in-law,
she is an icy, objectionable female—as cold as a
dog’s nose, and as stiff as a defunct shark. Pro-
bably the author found it impossible to fill her
place with any other relative, but of late we have
seen almost too much mother-in-law on the stage.
But despite this drawback, Mr. Justin M’Carthy’s
comedy is one of the best we have seen since
last time, and it deserves, and will doubtless have,
a successful run.
* # ® •
Ladies first. Lady Osterley, the formid-
able mother-in-law, is an aristocratic and fleshy
female who! runs a peers’ preservation society and
takes a deep Interest in the Bev. Barnabas
Goodeve’s mission to Fiji. She also runs the
whole menagerie at Oldacre Houaa, and Lord
Launcelot Oldacre is reduced to all sorts ol ex-
pedients to get an occasional holiday. He is in
search of an excuse of some kind when he is in-
vited to contest Northampton In the Conservative
interest, and the problem is solved by the de-
spatch of his secretary, a Violent ttadicalj to per-
sonate him, while the nobleman departs to take a
look at the flowing bowl and study in London the
anatomy of the ballet. But the secretary is met
at his destination by a reception committee
about] 10.000 strong ,who want to know what kind
of brick he prefers to be hit with, and ho only
saves his employer from being murdered by proxy
by falling back on his own sentiments and pledg-
ing the Tory candidate to abolish everything under
the sun. He shouts tea and shrimps for CdOO elec-
tors, falls in love under his assumed name with a
mysterious widow, and is returned triumphantly
by a crowd who shriek themselves hoarse with
crying “To h—l with the Lords I ” He misiea Lord
Oldacre, however, on his return journey, and that
unfortunate man arrives home to find his mother-
in-law on the rampage like a committee of one
lunatic with a mad-dog in the chair, and opening
love-letters from the Northampton widow. At
first he declares he has been defeated, and then, on
the secretary’s appearance, makes frightful efforts
to explain that this was only a poetic way of
describing his victory. Tbea he finds out that he
is pledged to abolish himself and everybody else.
aLo t&at he tua a Jove-affar in hand, and a bill of
about £5OOO to pay, £7OO of which have been spent
in presen s to the widow. The "H*m«ive mission-
ary grows excited and puts his foot down, and
the rest of the company fall over it, while a wild
domestic cyclone tears up connubial happiness by
the roots At the end, of course, the mother-in-
law is bowled out—she always in under such cir-
cumstances; the missionary meets a similar fate,
and “the Candidate” retires from pol.tlcs in
disgust.
* ♦ ♦
Mr. H. St. Maur makes his first appearance
in Australia as the suffering candidate, and plays
the part admirably, while Mr. Bed wood ss the
secretary, and Mr. Greville as the missionary who
tuffers from cold feet, divide the rest of the male
honours. Miss Powys, as Lady Dorothy Osterley,
is also paying her first visit to the colonies, and
proves that she Is fitted for something better than
to be harried by a fiendish old mother-in-law. Miss
Watt-Tanner took the part of that untamed rela-
tive, and it seemed to come naturally to her. We
would prefer that she were some one else's mother-
in-law than ours. As for the other ladles, we
promise them the notice they deserve next week,
provided this planet continues till then to revolve
peacefully on its axis.

The Buffaloes at Sydney Princess are still
going at their starting pace, and do not seem up
to date to have moulted a feather, or, to use a
more suitable simile, to have turned a hair. And
the audiences are as satisfactory and satisfied as
erst. We go, Hugo, they go, and universal joy is
the result of the pilgrimage. There now! That
is what we call a nice fat little notice.
Prof. Geo. Chainey, from America, reminds
us of the pictures of Beecher. His face is not
pretty, but massive. He wears his hair down on
his shoulders, like Samson, our Allpreis, Oscar
Wilde, and otner great and good men; and he has
an orotund voice that we envy. We couldn’t
quite get the hang of what Mr. Cnainey’s belief is,
from his lecture on the Ideal Man aad Woman,
but as he is going to lecture 35 times more, no
doubt we’li know everything before he bas done.
Only he tells us that sentiment Is not all nonsense
in this work-a-day world. The artists, sculptors,
scientists, inventors, who chsse the ideal which is
higher than their thought, often catch the real,
and it is toeir names that become great in the
world. To be an ideal man, or even nearly one,
you have to put cleanliness before godliness, not
after it, for the perfect health of body affects the
spirit, and the greatest purity in both nears the
ideal. Breeding Is so neglected, says Chainey,
that many sons of the aristocracy are neither men
nor monkeys, and so in America a new name has
been Invented tor them, and they are called dudes.
An ideal man must bs intellectually free, and have
his own ideas, not be the slave of a stupid, fashion-
able creed. But Freethought must not be con-
founded with Nothought. My lectures, observed
the orator, will not be keyed to the prevailing “ no
faith ” of these times, but to this new faith, which
—though it contains no definition of the Infinite—
contains the potency and promise of better things
in store for humanity, and prompts us to open our
hearts to the warmth and power of that which is
greater than our thought. As before stated, we
don’t entirely get the hang of this, but it *eems
quite unobjectionable, and there is nothing in the
new programme to cause the gentlest to blush.

“ The Pearl Divers,” a play professing to
be an adaptation from the French, was the attrac-
tion in the Sydney Tneatre Koyal last Saturday.
It was heralded as a story of the sea. There ap-
peared to be plenty of material to ' all upon, but
the water part was small In quantity and shallow
In Its effect upon the imagination. The play has
indeed no right to the title it flaunts either in Its
original language or in that of its adaptation.
There is one diving scene, and there’s an end of it.
The thunder storm In the London street was
peculiarly erratic. The rain came with a swish
that, could It only have been fathered on to the
elements,would have supplied a valuable argument
In favour of desigu In Nature. The man who
made the thunder for the occasion should stand
In Hyde Park some day and listen to the original
manufacturer entertaining the universe. He
would recognise that the harmony Is altogether
different.
* * ♦
The play in itself is slapped up. The work-
man crammed In his situations anyhow. The
result is a rapid succession of badly-connected
tableaux. But there is merit here and there.

ROWLANDS' ODONTO is the best, purest
and most fragrant preparation for the teeth.
Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes
nor pastes can possibly be as efficacious for polish-
ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non-gritty tooth powder; such
Howlands’ Odonto has always proved itself to bo.
ROWLANDS BUKONIA is a beautifully

Carnrick’s Cod Liver Oil Milk
PEPTONISED (DIGESTED.)
Highly recommended by the Medical Profession throughout the world as being
the best remedy for Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Scrofula, Wasting
Diseases, Consumption, General Debility, over-taxed brains, &c., &c.
It will produce an immediate gain i n flesh and strength.
Can be taken when all other forms of Cod Liver Oil aro refused.
It contains about equal parts of the best Norwegian Cod Liver Oil and concen-
trated fresh milk, both peptonised (digested).
The peptonised milk disguises the unpleasant taste and smell of the oil. and
makes it as sweet as cream: very palatable and most nourishing.
Invaluable for children, and will agree with the most delicate persons, causing
no return or unpleasantness.
One trial will satisfy anyone of the great value of this new and unique pre-
paration.
The reconstructive or nutritiva properties are five times greater than the
plain oil or any other Emulsion, hence it is much cheaper.
Both the Oil and the Milk being digested, the whole will assimilate, whereas
in Cod Liver Oil and other Emulsions (being undigested) only a small
proportion is of any value. It is the most uerfect Emulsion «var
made, and the only one of digested Cod Liver Oil and Milk.
Analysed and recommended by the first Professors in Europe.
We also manufacture the above preparation combined with Hypophosphites
of Lime and Soda. SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS.

Important to Mothers & Nurses
Carnrick’s Soluble Food for Infants, Invalids,
and Aged Persons, is the most nutritious, palatable, and easily-digested Infant S
Food ever manufactured, containing fifty per cent, of the solids of milk (digested),
and fifty per cent, of the finest wheat, converted into soluble form.
A most perfect food. The nearest approach to Mother’s Milk ever made.
It is unequalled for the formation of fat, flesh, and bOHGi and increasing
the vital forces SO necessary to health.
Specially recommended in cases of Marasmus, Diarrhoea, and Cholera
Infantum, and where the digestion is defective.
Children fed {upon cereals or cow’s milk alone very often remain weak, and
suffer from softening of the bones, and when attacked by infantile iis-
orders are unable to resist the inroads of disease.
11 CARNRICK’S SOLUBLE FOOD” is invaluable for Invalids
and Aged Persons (who cannot digest farinaceous food), as it is rich
in nutritive and easily-digested albumenoids, thus increasing both flesh
and strength, and restoring the vital forces.
It is most convenient for use,being in a powdered form, and will keep indefinitely.
. When boiled and stirred for three minutes it is ready for immediate use.

There are vigour, novelty, and even passion in
some parts. Where the villain is overpowered in
the lunatici asylum, the excitement generated on
the stage honestly pervades the audience. The
cast la large, and the acting all round is meri-
torious. In the case of some of the characters the
acting rises to excellence. Miss Agnes T .omas
and Mr. Beck again appear, and in stronger form
than in the preceding play. Mr. J. H. Ralnfori’s
Chadbrook may be a careful study, but it would
be ungenerous to judge an actor by bis manage-
ment of such a part. Mr. H. S Jordan looked and
spoke with much freshness in the early part of the
play, and Mr. Herbert Flemming, the companion
diver, was hearty and capable throughout.
* * *
Mr. George Leitoh devoted himself to
pourtraying a meddling lunatic named Thlbbets.
When Mr. Leitch arrived in Melbourne some years
ago, we thought the character in which he then
appeared, that of a rather wise old man who un-
consciously did silly things From that night we
lost Mr. Leitch. On encountering him on Satur-
day last, the changes Time effects were made
apparent. Mr. Leitch now plays the part of a silly
young man who unconsciously does wise things,
mere is no doubt this actor possesses abilities of
a worthy kind. For a combination of humour
and pathos he has many advantages. His voice
is thin, fine, sweet, and flexible. His bearing and
manner are true for picturing gentleness, timidity,
or pitiful helplessness. But when he writes his
own play, he gives himself a part that is contemp-
feeble. When he adapts (if this be an
adaptation), he gives himself a part that Is con-
temptibly feeble also. He goes on letting old
jokes dribble through the house. He goes on
making people wince at his attempts to be funny.
Why does not Mr. MaoMahon, who looks to be a
zealous man, cut the jokes out of his partner’s

It was not, as stated by the Sydney Suv-
day , Times, “ Mr. Justin M'Carthy, M.P., whose
fame as a novelist and wit of the first water be-
trayed the parentage,” who wrote “The Candi-

M.P. and possibly a wit of the first water, has not
yet gained fame as a novelist.

The Japanese Village has caught on in
Melbourne, and threatens to become the leading
mashmg-market of the city, A temporary build-
ing has been erected for the show, and things
already look quite homely and settled-down-llke.
It Is a distinguishing trait of the Japanese that
they always identify their surroundings with
themselves. We studied the habits of this ancient
people in the Mikado, and speak with authority.
The newness and Instability of the Melbourne
Village escapes notice. The villagers have im-
parted to it an air of mellowness peculiarly their
aD ? e of artisans (particularly the man
with the shaved head, who is generally believed to
be a king in his own country) seem as though they
had been born in their present village, and recked
pot of the turmoils, trials, and vexations of the
world outside. Looking at them as they patientlv
P®jf a T a^ at something which could be done
r « “® r better at Birmingham in a thousandth part
of the time, one is apt to think: “It were good
to be aJapanese.” Evidently they have an
inner life which they keep all to themselves
—a pure guileless existence into which sin entereth
not. This refers to male Japs. The young ladies
are even more frivolous than they were in Sydney

which has made it the fashionable resort of Mel-
bourne. An idea prevails that the Japanese yarns,
which these little darlings always appear to bo
whispering to one another, would be quite too
much for us in an English translation. When
they get to the funny parts they glance obliquely
at the young men with a " would-you-like-to-
know-all-about-lt” expression, which is exces-
sively tantalising. This part of the show alone
was always worth the two-bob charged for admit-
tance, without mentioning the temple, in which

land is becoming a moneyed one. Lord Wolver-
ton leads out with £50,000 under challenge from
the Earl of Rosebery, who responds with £50,000
as a contribution to the Liberal fund.
The oleaginous Davies, in the N.S.W. As-
sembly, suggested recently that a 50 per cent, ad
valortm duty be imposed on the equally oleaginous
Lloyd. We presume that this would be for pro-
tective purposes only. It could hardly be a means
of revenue.
Mr. Cato has given notice in the S. A. As-
sembly of a bill for payment of members; he pro-
poses an annual honorarium of £3OO to each
legislator. In Victoria, the amount, and in N.S.W.
the proposed amount, is £3OO, i e ,, two hundred
times the traditional 30 pieces of silver.
The Irish Conservatives who are now
opposing Home Rule were the first to start the
movement at the Bllton Hotel, Dublin, with the
late Isaac Butt. At that meeting Colonel Klng-
Harman was appointed secretary, and now the
gallant gentleman is among the army of ammuni-
tionless rifles.
There are 40,000 people in the workhouses
in the North of England. The result of the recent
elections goes to show that much of the voting
democratic power of England is in the workhouse.
It will be bad for a lot of people when, In the ful-
ness of time, manhood suffrage comes along and
paupers get votes.
Dan O’Connor, aghast at the recent Pro-
tectionist demonstration in Sydney, has sheered
off Parkes and is playing a lone hand prior to
44 turning dog ” on the Free-traders. Dan is ex-
pected to make, within the next six weeks, a big
oration, proving conclusively that he has been an
enthusiastic Protectionist ever since he was six
years old.
Mr. Melville actually tried to pun in the
N S.W. Assembly last week. He said that
Mr. Lloyd would 44 no doubt make a floury
oration.” This comes of sitting opposite the Pad-
dington humourist. Anything of that kind is
infectious—it would not be surprising if some
more members were to star as uncertiflcated
Insolvents shortly.
The late general election in Nova Scotia
resulted in an overwhelming victory for the
Liberals, who are pledged to support the secession
ef that colony from the Dominion, and a policy
of reciprocity with the United States. Even an-
nexation to the States was favoured by some of
the successful candidates. How is this for 44 Im-
perial Federation ? ”
The especial organ (printed on Sunday) of
the Sabbatarian Parkes, says the Ulster men “ are
drilling for civil war. It is idle to pooh-pooh this
movement. There is more body in it than many
people imagine. Of this we may shortly publish
some Information which may perhaps startle the
easy-going public not a little.” What I Are the
Parkes party drilling ?
Mudgee Taylpr, writing to Monday’s
Sydney D T., says he 44 has not yet swal-
lowed a purely Protectionist policy.” A.G. is
evidently waiting to see which way the cat jumps,
and when he sees clearly that the people of N.S.W.
have 44 swallowed a purely Protectionist policy”
he will doubtless be prepared to do likewise, and
to pose as a Protectioniit.
Baron Maclay’s project for founding a
Russian colony seems likely to collapse, as it now
appears that to Induce Russians to emigrate is an
indictable offence. Moreover, a Muscovite emi-
grant must be smuggled out of the country dis-
guised as fresh meat or some other merchandise,
and he would probably be broken open by the
Custom-house officers before being passed, lest he
should have something dutiable in his stomach. It
is great fun to be a Russian.
44 Bear in mind,” said Parkes last week,
44 that it was Hi whogaveyou your grand Hedu-
cation Haet.” No, Parkes, we won’t bear it In
mind. It was Greenwood, who is now dead, who
gave N.S.W. her grand mongrel threepence-a-week
Congregational system of Heducation. The N.S.W.
public school system is nothing to gush over. The
free, secular, and compulsory Victorian system
will have to be initiated in the long ruo. Parkes’
impudent assumption of the paternity of the
Heducation Hact was obviously a sectarian-ticket
move; and we all know what was meant by his
call of 44 Three cheers for the Queen.”
At last there is a prospect of the franchise
being extended to the members of the Victorian
police force. This is as it should be. Under exist-
ing arrangements a Chinaman is permitted to
record his vote, and if a policeman is as good as a
Chinaman he should be entitled to swap his vote
for a pint of beer like any other citizen. Some
people object to this argument, and one of them is
the able Deakin. The youthful Chief Secretary
considers himself equal to a Chinaman, but will
not admit the same with respect to the guardians
of the Victorian peace and the Victorian house
maids. J J. Madden, an exceptlonally-intelllgent
politician, has stated in the’Ouse his belief that
44 if the police had the franchise they would use it
as intelligently as the Chinaman.”
Colbubn’s United Service Magazine is
the mouthpiece of the mi itary and naval "toffs ’
of the British service. Here is an extract in which
it views the Home Rule question from the stand-
point of intelligent Toryism:— 44 The army officers
in Ireland would be the greatest sufferers. With
the gentlemen driven from the country, there
would be no shooting or hospitality, and nobody
but peasantry, small farmers, and the dregs of the
lower middle classes to associate with.” This is the
noble spirit in which English Conservatism views
a people's right to self-government. The Irish
people are to be denied Homo Rule because fast-
living “ offlcaws” of the service will ba deprived
of the pleasure of loafing on the “shoneens”
around, the garrison towns. In Ireland, under
Home Rule, there would be no shooting—of land-
lords.
In the Imperial Parliament, just before the
last dissolution, Mr Libouchere asked if Mr.
Gladstone would Introduce a bill to provide for
the payment of all necessary election expenses by
the Treasury, so that any candidate, however re-
stricted his means were, might be able to stand.
Mr. Gladstone replied that, although he entirely
approved of the principle, he was unable then to
introduce such a bill, “But,” he said, “ I would
go one step farther. I think it very hard on the
working class of this country, that, in a country
which is so liberal as to make provision for a
number of political pensions for salaried public
officers—which pensions are often held by men of
birth and station —that in the same country, where
the labouring men desire to return a member of
their own class, they should have to pay the ex-
penses of his election, and also to support him
while engaged presumably in the disonarge of
public duties.” This declaration In favour of
payment of members will give the Tories fresh
cause to hate the Giant Liberal.
The N.B.W. Protectionists have at last
begun to stir tha people up. Recently several
meetings have been held In Sydney to advocate
encouragement to colonial industry, and these
meetings have had the right ring about them.
The names of such Freetraders as Sir Henry
Parkes, J. C. Neild, B. R. Wise, and G. H. Reid are
received with groans by the Industrial classes, and
the working men are beginning to show how
strongly they disapprove of their pretended
friends, Messrs. Abigail, Jacob Garrard, John
Sutherland, Dan. O’Connor, J. 8. Hawthorne, and
William Henson. The question of Protection has
hitherto b sen made to subserve Orangeism and
faction fighting- even now the Sydney Daily
Telegraph is waving the Bloody shirt of Aus-
tralian politics by asserting that there Is a “ Fenian
conspiracy” afoot—but Protection Is at last seen to
be something more important than fanaticism.
Men must decide whether they will fight for super-
stition or for bread and butter. Want has taught
them what formerly they were not able to under-
stand.
Parkc-s’ especial organ, the “Neo-Liberal”
thunderor—the only paper In N.S.W., apart from
the D.T. and the (we were almost going to say
“other”) Orange rags, which supports the once
great Hi-Ham through thick and thin—is “con-
spired ” In a cellar, and—blasphemous audacity 1—
it brazenly ho sts of the fact that it is printed and
published on Sunday. This latter circumstance is
rather awkward for the Sabbatarian champion, Sir
Henry, who entertains so sincere a respect for the
Sawbath, and would rather break all the rest of
Exodus than do violence to the commandment
regarding the dly of rest; but, after all, it Is hardly
good enough to quarrel with this solitary sup-
porter. If the Kiama Ghost inventor took out his
moral bung and let his sentiments loose, he would
probably tell the editor that he Is a gory Sabbath-
breaking impostor, but it is necessary to disguise
his love for tfie present. When, towards the close
of the forty-second century of the alleged Chris-
tian era, Parkes again comes into power in New
South Wales, with his tag-rag and bobtail of
bilious-coloured political humbugs who can
neither spell nor get their Insolvency certificates,
Bailey will be—rewarded ? Yes, he will be re-
warded—by being suppressed. Such is the grati-
tude of this cruel world I
When John Woods, the member for Sta-
weli in the Victorian Assembly, was on his first
canvassing tour through the Crowiands electorate,
he arranged to speak at Eversley, a township
consisting of the proverbial “pub.” and store—in
this instance combined. His audience was com-
posed of three persons—A. A. Ciennes, now secre-
tary of the Wimmera Waterworks Trust, then
John Woods’ chaperon, andi special correspondent
to the Ararat Advertiser; the landlord of the
“pub.,” and the “old band” who did duty as
groom. The first-named was sober. Woods, with
that modest audacity which has stood him in good
stead a thousand times since, was not disposed to
flinch from orating to an audience of one sober
man, and mounted the stump. He spoke for half-
an-hour (his speech, by the bye, filled three
columns of the ’Tiser), and was rapturously
applauded by the solitary “ free and independent ”
elector. After the oration there were some
drinks, and then, assuming as much dignity as was
possible under the distressingly alcoholic circum-
stances, the landlord, the only elector present said :
"I’m er-goln’ to vote for yer.” “Thank you,”
proudly murmured John. “ Oh, don’t be in such
an inf nai hurry, old man. I’m er-goln’ to vote
fur yer ’cos I ’ate this blarsted country, an’ I don’t
care ’ow soon it goes to the devil, an’ I thinks yer
the man to send it there.” That qualification of
the vote of confidence did not appear in the news-
paper reports.
“Dear Bulletin, —Can you possibly in-
duce Lord Carington to give up his custom of
saying, whenever he is cordially received in his
tours abroad, that he is pleased with the good-
will shown to him ‘as her Majesty's representa-
tive,’ This expression is no more than a little
piece of Jingo hypocrisy, and is something of an
Insult to the native Australian, who admires Lord
Carington as a man, and not as the deputy of the
stout Teuton lady who is wo shipped byßdtish
snobs. People here don’t welcome Lord Caring-
ton as her Majesty’s representative. Was not
Lord Loftus in tne same position, and did he not
maintain far more ‘dignity’ than the present
occupant of Government Bouse? And yet none
were found so mean as to do him any more out-
ward respect than was consistent with the barest
recognition of his official position. If he did not
get the joyous welcome now accorded to Lord
Carington, it necessarily follows that the
public in the latter case appreciate the man
(and his wife), not the Sovereign mistress.
To the man who is a patriotic Australian, i e., who
loves Australia truly, Lord Carington is the king
of N.8.W., the very model of a consttiti onal
monarch, capable of being a suitable figurehead to
the State and to society, and willing as well as able
to show a good example to society, while he can-
not interfere in any way with the pjlilical liberties
of the people. IE N.S.W. did separate from
Britain, it might do much worse than start off as a
limited monarchy with Carington as King Charles
I. Meanwhile, at every puniic event we are dis-
gusted with this forced attempt of Lord Carington
to act the Imperial flunkey, reminding us of that
political connection with Britain which gives us
C. in peace and lorelgn bombardments,
occupations, and indemnities la war. And speak-
ing of our independence, surely we could hold our
own against the rest of tae world as well as Chili,
La Plata, Uruguay, and feru, which would fall a
much easier prey to any Russian or German an-
nexation and conquest programme.—Yours, &0.,
Scoto-Australian.”
For the edification of the Primrose
Leaguers of Australasia we print the following
extract from a speech made by their defunct god
D. in 1844 The edition of Disraeli s speeones
which contains this remarkable oration was pub-
lished in 1870, and in the preface Beaoonsfleld de-
clared “ that in spite of some heedless rhetoric, he
believed in his histoiical conscience that the senti-
ment of th at speech was right;. Justice to Ireland
was said to mean an identity of institutions With
England. 1 believe that to be the greatest fallacy
that can be brought forward. I always thought
that the-greate.t cause of misery in Ireland was the
identity of institutioßS wth England. . . . In-
stead of bavin r an identity of Institutions you
should get rid of all those English institutions
which you hive forced upon the country. . . .
I venture to lay do vn as a principle that the
Government of Ireland should be on a sys’em the
reverse of England, and should be centralised,
that they should have a strong Executive and an
impartial administration. These are Tory princi-
ples—the natural principles of the democracy of
England. . . . They certainly are not the Tory
principles of those who would associate Toryism
with restricted commerce and with a continual
assault' on the of the subject. If we
want permanently to settle the Irish affairs with
credit to ourselves and to the satisfaction of the
Irish people, we [must reconstruct the social sys-
tem of that country and we must commence by
organising a very comprehensive and pervading
Executive. The connection with Emland thus be-
comes the present state or Ireland If the connec-
tion with England prevents a revolution, and a
revolution be the only remedy, England, logically,
is in the odious position of being the cause of all
the misery in Ireland. What, then, is the duty of
an English Minister ? To effect by his policy all
those changes which a revolution would do by
force. That is the Irish question in its integrity.
It is'quite evident that to effect this we must have
an Executive In Ireland, which shall bear a much
nearer relation to the leading classes and charac-
ters of the country than it does at present. . . .
The system which cannot bear discussion is doomed.
I will sav, if thesa recommendations are adopted,
that in 50 years hence the men who shall succeed
the present generation in Parliament will And the
people of Ireland a contented and thriving
peasantry.”
At Hongkong, “loyalty” appears to be
exuding from every Chinese pore. Even our yel-
low brother. Hi Yah, who drives an opium busi-
ness, and How Long, the pork-pie vendor, have
taken to presenting addresses to Royalty, and their
affection has resulted in “ Wales ” receiving a
huge silk towel covered with inscriptions that re-
semble a bullock-team breaking up a tea-meeting.
On closer inspection, however, this proves to be
Mongol poetry; the biggest bullock—the one with
the broken rib and the mutilated hoop-iron tall—
is a euloglum on Queen Victoria, and the broken
teapot and the cloud of flying cups and saucers
are a touching description ol the greatness
of the British empire. At the bottom of
the document a calf with a jam tart impa'ed on
its horn is jumping on a Tartar curate, but this is
only the Celestial way of saying that “your peti-
tlpners will every pray,” &o. A Presbyterian
missionary, who has resided for many years in the
East, has translated this shattered bun-gorge into
English verse, and the opening stanzas run as
follows:
“ Great England's Prince, the Empire’s heir,
And better far the heir of Her
Who wears a Crown more rich and rare
Than wealth of Indies can confer—
Long live the Queen I Long may she wear
That Crown of goodness pure and bright,” &o.
Evidently the Hongkong Mongols are a forgiving
race when they All a whole yard of silk with
flying beefsteaks in praise of a woman who has
literally ruined their nation, body, mind, and
soul, for the benefit of her own Empire. It was
Victoria who waged the disgraceful opium war
against the Pokin Government, and inflicted a
curse a hundred times worse than that of alcohol
on a nation of 401,000 000 human beings to pre-
serve the trade of India and her own gilded
splendour. The Chinaman, as we know him, is a
degraded wretch, half-man, half-beast, and his
degradation is partly owing to the opium curse
which our “gracious” Queen Inflicted on him.
What he is she has helped to make him, and 30
grovelling addresses will not wipe away the stain.
This letter, out from the Sydney Morning
Herald, is stated to have been written bv a colo-
nist, now in England, to a friend in N.S.W. He
says of the present position of affairs in the United
Kingdom;—"The fact Is that Free-trade England
has to fight, with the world banded against her,
with hostile and Protective tariffs. At the outset,
when Free-trade was initiated under the Cobden
school, England, from the protection Nature had
given her in the Immense stores of coal and iron,
which she alone in Europe possessed, and from
being the first who was enabled to take advantage
of the revolution in Industry from the discovery
of stem, development of railways and steamers,
63., while the rest of Europe was split up into
little petty states subject to revolutions, was able
for a while to distance all her competitors. But
all this has been altered. Germany, Italy, Russia;
and the rest of the world have been formed into
strong and united peoples, with strong and settled
Governments. The bulk of these nations, es-
pecially French, Germans, Italians, and Belgians,
are man for man better educated, more thrifty,
and willing' to work much longer hours, and able
to live for half the money that Englishmen
of the same class require, and have conse-
quently more than made up the leeway they
laboured under ; and as all English goods to
these countries are heavily taxed, while we admit
theirs to compete with ours duty free, they are
growing richer whilst England’s wealth is rapidly
vanishing. The farmers, and consequently the
landlords, are without exception almcsi ruined.
Sir James Calrd, the great authority on agricul-
tural matters, has shown by figures that there is
an annual loss of £4O 000,000 sterling In the value
and rents of agricultural land in England within
the last six years; and as the imports for the same
period have decreased 80,000 000 and the exports
30.000. while the population (exclusive of emi-
gration) has been and is increasing at nearly 400,000
a year, it does not, I think, require much gift of
proph:cy to predict there must be a change before
long. Besides, there is this Irish question to be
settled, and, worst of all, the new power given
under the late ex tension of the franchise to the new
democracy, the bulk of whom consists of a class
ground down for centuries under the feudal and
class system of Government which has prevailed
here, and under which their condition has been
little better than that of serfs. Fancy 3,000 000
of such people suddenly given the power’ of
politically swamping the upper and middle
classes. It will, of course, take them some
years to understand the power they have
been put in possession of, and to be pro-
perly organised by their political leaders; but
the day is within measureable distance when Eng-
land will be shaken to her very foundations.
Mind, all this time the sole sources of England's
wealth, her coal and iron, which alone have given
her her commercial superiority, are being rapidly
drawn upon. Tbe output of coal, which was only
10 millions of tons at the beginning of this cen-
tury, has grown to an output of 160 million; of
toes per annum, or, say, 600.000 tons per working
day; and although there are still Immense fle'ds
left, ihe easiest and cheapest got coal is naturally
being extracted, so that before very long, when
this has been exhausted, they must fall back on
the deeper and more costly worked coal, so that
England will have to face an increased price in
her coal, while America, China, and other coun-
tries have their inexhaustible fields comparatively
untouched. The population of Great Britain has
likewise grown, under the artificial stimulus of
steam and its results, from 10 millions at
the beginning of thislcentury to 38 millions,
whilst from being an exporter of wheat
and grain, she is absolutely dependent on
foreign supplies for three-fourths of the food
of the peop e. Did ever the world see a nation in
such an unnatural and artificial condition ? The
great wealth here is in very few hands, and the
bulk of the people are pauperised and brutalised
by the struggle for existence. Such is the gloomy
view I take of old England's future, and unless
she can unite all her great dependencies in some
great federal Z filverain, like our 'cute friend Bis-
marck did with Germany as the prelude to an
united people, I think the old country has seen
her best days. Sentiment is all very well, but de-
pend upon it, if she wants to keep her colonies,
there must be with nations, as with Individuals,
the great bond of self and mutual benefit. Eng-
land has still the best market in the world to offer,
and with discriminating duties in favour of the
colonies, and by reciprocity on their part in
favour of English g jods, is the only way I can see
for confederation to be brought about. I fear,
however, people here are so wedded to Cobden and
his theories that the prospect is at present hope-
less.—Miy 20, 1888.” This letter is not only re-
markable for its picturesque truthfulness, but also
for the fact of its appearance in the Herald
Wnether a production so strongly opposing Free-
trade would nave been allo wed to appear previous
to the recent triumph of Protection ia New South
Wales, is a question which readers of the Herald
will be disposed to answer with an emphatic
negative.
