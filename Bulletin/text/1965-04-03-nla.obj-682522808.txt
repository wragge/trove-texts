KALCOLOR
changing the
architectural scene
Kalcolor is more than just another
anodising process. It is a new method of
imparting to aluminium, colours that
will never fade. No other architectural
anodic finish measures up to Kalcolor.
It provides complete uniformity and
reproducibility of colour, greater
corrosion and abrasion resistance than
ever before, as well as absolute
lightfastness. Kalcolor is available
in the range of classic architectural
colours shown below exclusively from
Comalco andthesole licensed processor,
Aluminium Anodisers. The richness and
beauty of Kalcolor is evident on
Sydney’s new Lasalle Building.
J. Connolly Limited used both sheet
and extrusions with a bronze Kalcolor
finish to obtain a perfect colour match.

Tunnelling in progress, Snowy Mountains Scheme
Partners in a mountain problem
Rock drills with air line hose.
Tunnelling through the Great Dividing Range poses extra tough problems for the contractors
on the mighty Snowy Mountains Scheme but Dunlop Industrial Products Division have
been able to assist in many ways.
Dunlop have provided extra light weight, yet extra tough nylon air line hose for rock drills;
hoses for water; belts for muckers; wire braided hose for hydraulic equipment and conveyor
belts to shift the aggregate at construction sites.
Dunlop is well represented elsewhere. In Tasmania a special tear-resistant conveyor belt was
used in tunnelling operations that established a new world record at Poatina.
Dunlop conveyor belts and Wedgropes also play a big part at Tinaroo Dam, Queensland.
With all this Dunlop engineering come the men of the Dunlop Technical Service, on-the-spot
working partners right from the planning stage.
Wherever great national development projects are in action so is Dunlop.
now what can we do for you?

National Notebook
For People Who Count
Vou may not have heard of the case of
“Squire” magazine. “Squire” is pub-
lished by D.B. Publications in Sydney
and some of the advertising copy reads:
“People who count. People who are going
to count. They’re the ones who read
‘Squire’! People who reap an income
well above the average and turn to
‘Squire’ to read about the best in food,
clothes, cars, travel, liquor and living.”
The price is six shillings. The cover
carries no date, just Vol. 1, No. 8. No
doubt with the idea that every copy of
“Squire” is eternal. The objects of
“Squire” are obvious. This is designed to
be the Australian “Playboy” and it is
patterned precisely on the classic “Play-
boy” formula. In Vol. 1, No. 8, there’s
an article on very expensive Italian motor
cars (listed provocatively on the cover
as “those beautiful Italian bodies”);
there’s an article on censorship, fourth
in a series by Professor May; there’s
an article titled “The Genteel Pornogra-
phers”; there’s a page of fruity “club
jokes”; and instead of the bunny
there’s the “Squire” girl of the month
who appears in all sorts of frolicsome
poses, finally winding up starkers in color
over a two-page spread; there are short
stories, an article on male fashion, and so
on.
Now here’s the “Squire” dilemma. Last
week Mr Alan David, managing director
of Turner and Henderson, controller of
D.B. Publications, came to Melbourne.
He said: “We run a good type of men’s
magazine. We run a few sophisticated
nudes, all local girls, all good back-
ground. We run a little biography, telling
ali about them. Lately we have run into
trouble. No, “Squire” has never been
banned anywhere. But we are under rigid
censorship conditions. From now on,
virtually, we will have to run a separate
magazine, just for Victoria. You talk to
my editor about it.”
The editor, Mr Jack de Lissa, was
only too happy to talk about it: “Yes,
that’s right, from now on I’m running
practically another magazine for .Vic-
toria. I get the OK in every other State.
I even get the OK from the Queensland
Censorship Board. The standards are
absolutely ridiculous. Now I’ve got no-
thing against Gordon and Gotch, they’ve
got to protect themselves, but they dis-
tribute the magazine. In Melbourne
they've got their own censor. I have to
submit to him all articles, pictures and
artwork for approval.
“We’ve been going for eight months
now. After the first issue we were told
‘No nipples in color on the gatefold.’
You know the gatefold, that’s the large
nude in the centre that folds out. OK, no
nipples in color on the gatefold. Next we
get the order ‘no nipples in black and
white.’ We follow that instruction and
then we’re told ‘no nipples in drawings or
cartoons of any kind.’ That was about the
fourth issue. Can you imagine? But that
wasn’t all—the next instruction was ‘no
bare bosoms’. Every bosom had to be
covered or partly covered.
Jack de Lissa then explained his new
plan of action. “In our next issue we will
have several pictures which will appear
in all other States except Victoria. This
won’t involve a great deal of trouble”.
Ah, but what about your “Squire” girl of
the month? “Gee, that’s too expensive for
the time being. Do you know what the
color plates cost for those pictures?
£2OO and that would be only the start of
it. There would be all the business of
separate colors and pictures and so on.
“I only hope that before long Victoria
will change from this ridiculous’ attitude.
But do you know the incredible part in
all this? ‘Squire’ sells better in Victoria
than anywhere.”
Customs Calling
T ike Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Wandering
Minstrel”, book censorship in Vic-
toria is very much a “thing of rags and
patches”. The G. and S. allusion comes
naturally to mind, for the latest cen-
sorship scare is more like a comic
opera than an episode in public
administration. A representative of a
Melbourne publisher’s agent, Hicks,
Smith and Sons, reported last week that
he had received a telephone call from
a person claiming to be an official of the
Customs Department. The caller told
the agent that if further copies of the
book “Black Voices” were imported into
the country the book would be banned.
He added the novel “Narrow Action’*
would be allowed into the country only
in limited numbers.
Immediately the yeomen of the anti-
censorship guard lowered their piles.
Professor A. R. Chisolm said that he was
surprised that the book should be
banned, “only the intellectual would read
‘Black Voices’. The type of reader look-
ing for spicy stuff would be completely
put off”.
But next day the Minister for Customs
denied that either book was banned or
would be banned, and said that the phone
call had not come from officials of the
Customs Department.
As Newman Rosenthal, an executive
member of the Freedom to Read Associ-
ation, explained, the alleged Customs’
phone call seemed to be merely an ex-
tension of the principle applied by
censorship authorities over “The Group”,
“this time, instead of making the book-
sellers the censors by intimidation, the
procedure is to bring publisher’s agents
into the picture and prevent them from
bringing the book into the country”.
What the hoax telephone call reveals
is that Victorian booksellers are so used
to strange, undercover pressures being
applied by the censorship administration
that any outlandish telephone instruction
sounds genuine enough. The alternative
to obeying an anonymous caller may,
they feel, land them in court in un-
pleasant circumstances.
"Darling , we'll have to stop meeting like this — Lloyd's of London are
getting suspicious."

RESEARCH FOR
RELIARILITY
Paper for Progress No. 3 of a series
Packaging plays a vital role in Australia’s marketing and export drive and research is paving the
way for many of today’s new developments in packaging. In the modern laboratories of Australian
Paper Manufacturers Limited, A.P.M. researchers continually subject paper, paperboard and pack-
ages to punishing tests which lead to improved product and package design and better presenta-
tion of Australia’s products both at home and in our export markets. In the test pictured above, strips
of paper are fluted in the instrument on the left and the resistance to crush of the corrugated paper
is tested in the compression tester on the right. A high compression resistance is required in
corrugated fibre boards to protect the contents of packaged goods.

Making History
'T'his year will undoubtedly go down
in the minds of the average opera-
goer as the year of the Sutherland-
Williamson Grand Opera season. But
to musical historians it is more likely to
be the year of the first performance of
Eric Gross’s one-act opera, “The
Amorous Judge”.
Although “The Amorous Judge” is
only a small but courageous enterprise,
it fills so many more of the conditions
which opera should fill. It is the first
professional Australian opera written
with its singers in mind and with the
ideas of its producer in mind. The pro-
ducer, Robert Allnutt, and the singers
have had Mr Gross sitting with them
through rehearsals; they can have no
doubts about the composer’s intentions.
(No matter how surely Richard Bonynge
knows what he wants, he cannot know
what Donizetti or Bellini wanted.) And
“The Amorous Judge” has been written
by Mr Gross for his cast, with the music
sympathetic to the rhythms and color of
each voice. (No matter how beautifully
Miss Sutherland sings, the composers of
her operas certainly did not have her in
mind when they wrote.)
And with Williamson’s daily growing
a little whiter about the lips at the cost
of their forthcoming season, “The
Amorous Judge” may be historically
important as indicating the shape that
opera must take now that it has priced
itself out of the commercial market. That
shape is a smaller, more flexible pro-
duction which can tour more easily, be
put on more cheaply and can more easily
be transposed to the confines of a tele-
vision screen. It is also opera which
makes more demands on acting skill *and
which has a greater degree of dramatic
reality than the massive Italian operas
have.
“The Amorous Judge” project is
entirely free of those twin attitudes
which bedevil so much Australian
artistic activity—worthiness and amateur-
ism. The initiators have been Mr Gross,
Mr Allnutt and singer Alan Light. They
have as financial adviser Jack Argent,
the managing director of Leeds Music
Pty Ltd, which is publishing the opera.
The production is being underwritten
by W. D. and H. O. Wills to the extent
of £4200, but full houses for the six
Sydney performances would recoup
initial expenses.
The opera is an adaptation of “The
Broken Pitcher”, by von Kleist. The
libretto is by Professor Len McGlashan,
Professor of German at the University
of New England. Mr Gross, a lecturer
in the Music Department of Sydney
University, according to a slightly
astonished member of the department,
“didn’t miss a single day from the depart-
ment while he was writing the opera”.
The first half of the programme will be
Mr Gross’s “Sinfonietta”, for which
choreography has been done by Margaret
Barr. The dancer will be Vera Goldman.
Austrian-born Mr Gross is one of Aus-
tralia’s least temperamental and speediest
composers. He did the sound track for
the Commonwealth Film Unit’s docu-
mentary “From the Tropics to the Snow”.
This music will be released as an LP. Mr
Gross is at present working on a second
one-act opera, intended as a companion
to “The Amorous Judge”. It will be
based on Oscar Wilde’s “The Florentine
Tragedy”, and will have major roles for
the four singers in the company who play
small parts in “The Amorous Judge”.
“The Amorous Judge” opens at the
Union Theatre, Sydney, on April 2 and
will play for six non-consecutive per-
formances there. After that a tour of
all capital cities and some country centres
is planned. Leeds Music recently merged
with the American entertainment giant,
MCA, so there are strong possibilities
of American interest. “The Amorous
Judge” will be recorded and Mr Light
and Mr Allnutt are confident of Aus-
tralian television production, but instead
of going cap in hand to the ABC they
will go after the best offer from any
television channel.
The cast of “The Amorous Judge”
includes Alan Light, Valda Bagnall,
Rosalind Keene, Ronald Maconaghie,
Marie Tysoe, Althea Bridges and Frank
Lisle.
Pat L awl or
T>at Lawlor, NZ representative of
The Bulletin for the past 32 years,
retires this month. Over 50 years ago
he made his first attempt to join the staff
when John Barr introduced him to James
Edmond. The old warrior looked at
Pat’s then very boyish face and shook
his head. Pat looked sadly at Edmond’s
carpet slippers and returned to NZ. Next
attempt was made in 1922 when John
Dailey gave him an abortive interview
under the impression that he was Adrian
Lawlor. His third try was made in 1932.
Jobless, in the depths of the Depression,
Pat waited outside Ken Prior’s office
only to be told that as The Bulletin
had been without a NZ office for nearly
50 years “they would hardly set up one
now”. Dave Yaffa ’phoned Prior and
suggested that as Pat had travelled 1200
miles to see him he might just shake him
by the hand and wish him a safe return.
Ken capitulated and was so overcome by
Celtic eloquence that Lawlor left for
Wellington next day to commence his
32-year engagement. The only exciting
happenings during that period were:
(1) when a Stalin enthusiast heaved a
brick through his office window as a
protest against The Bulletin’s wartime
anti-Communism; (2) in 1960 when ACP
took over the paper.
Pat proposes to devote his spare time
to writing. His 12th book, “The Froth-
Blowers’ Manual”, has just been pub-
lished. He is toying with the idea of
writing the story of The Bulletin,
about which he has amassed considerable
material.
AUSTRALIA IS UNREADY FOR WAR
80 Years Ago: April 4, 1885
'The twin announcement of Russian
squadrons off the Cape of Good
Hope and off Singapore may be
equally canards. But they may also
not only possibly, but probably, be
true. It is our business to be pre-
pared for just such apparitions, even
though no such warnings have
reached us. A squadron of 16 vessels,
great and small, and allowing for a
large proportion of small vessels, such
as is said to have been sighted off the
Cape, may be estimated to be manned
(even supposing they carry no troops)
by a complement aggregating over
3000 men. Under favorable circum-
stances, 2000 of these could be
landed to make a dash at any city or
object not too far inland. Now, are
we prepared to meet and beat back
at any important point of our coast—■
say, for example, at Newcastle —2000

We have not a single machine-gun, nor

then, shall we be better prepared?
Parliament, called together to con-
sider a picnic war in the Soudan, has
been prorogued without a thought
given to the real war, the premonitory
mutterings of which were already
heard while members sat gabbling
about Glory and Loyalty.

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Plain English of Lee Kuan Yew
Q.: What did this experience (of
Japanese occupation) teach you about
the nature of colonialism, because this
gave you experience of both British
and Japanese colonialism?
P.M.: Well, it was a traumatic
experience. One day you had the
British there in all the big houses and
big cars occupying all the big shops
and stores in town; and we believed, or
were led to believe, that the British
were there because they were superior,
that they knew how to govern people,
with innate great ability. And we
wanted to govern ourselves, it might
take a few hundred years, we might
then learn how to do it about as well
as the British or nearly as well. But
in about two weeks of fighting and
there wasn’t much fighting either
there was a lot of running we dis-
covered that all their superiority was
really the capacity to use guns and
to frighten the other chap. And in a
matter of days the Japanese officers
were installed in all the big desks
where the British officers had been . ..
from an ABC television interview
with Alan Ashbolt
A new mood is emerging not only
in Afro-Asia but also amongst the
European powers. All are conscious
that the great divisions in the world
need no longer be between Europeans
and the rest. That would have been
too simple and clear-cut, too dangerous
for the Europeans, too easy for the
Afro-Asians. Nor is the division
simply between Communist and non-
Communist blocs.
Then we are told by the leaders
of Indonesia that the great division is
between the new emerging forces and
the old dying forces. And from the
way Indonesians treat their neighbors
not only Malaysia, but also young and
bustling Australia, are classified under
old dying forces.
from an address to the National
Press Club, Canberra
There are already some Australian
troops in Malaysia, some in Malaya,
some in Sarawak. You may ask why?
What for? First, what are we fighting
against? Secondly, what are we fight-
ing for? We Malaysians are fighting
against terrorists and guerrilla
platoons, trained and armed Indo-
nesians, some members of the regular
Indonesian army.
By any standard of international
practice, or just plain civilised be-
havior, this is wanton aggression.
Without allies, we would soon be
conquered, or (in the jargon of the
Indonesians) “liberated”, in the same
way as the Japanese once “liberated”
me in February, 1942. I have no use
for anyone “liberating” me.
What are Malaysians fighting for?
Well, to be left in peace in our own
country, to work and build a tolerant,
democratic and a relatively prosperous
society. In helping us defend our-
selves, you are asserting the principle
that nations with smaller populations
have the right to be left alone. And if
this principle is upheld, then the dan-
ger to Australia of being involved with
a more populous neighbor, wanting to
have her way with Australia, would be
that much less.
from an ABC “Guest or Honor” broadcast
The Prime Minister of Singa-
pore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
leaves Australia this week
after creating a deeper impres-
sion than any other visiting
Asian leader. “Plain English”
reports some extracts from his
speeches and interviews.
Q.: Well, do you think the racial
riots in Singapore last year augurs
well for the future of the Federation?
P.M.: It’s probably the biggest set-
back Malaysia has suffered. And
if it is repeated, either the next or the
time after that it might spread through-
out the whole of Malaysia, not just
Singapore. And then I think it would
be very difficult to put the bits and
pieces together again, because once
you’ve got a people through an
agonising experience like that, where
reason and compassion and humanity
disappear, and people act like
animals and the brown ant tries to eat
up the yellow ant and the yellow ant
tries to beat off the brown ant —well
you don’t quite so easily get back to
where you were. I think the hope
lies in the fact that we not just
the leadership in Singapore —I think
the leadership in Malaya, in Sabah and
Sarav/ak are all equally anxious as to
the dangers inherent in this.
from the TV interview
I know that a few Australians are
uneasy over Australia being involved
in conflicts taking place in Asia.
Some are fearful that, by supporting
Malaysia, Australians may, like the
Americans in South Vietnam, be said
to be supporting a reactionary, corrupt
and decadent regime—all for Western
military and strategic interests. And
this will bring odium upon Australia
from the many countries in Afro-Asia
with whom you want to be friends.
If not only the Government of Aus-
tralia, but, more important, also the
people of Australia made it generally
known that what they are supporting
in Malaysia is not a particular Malay-
sian Government but the people of
Malaysia and their right to self-deter-
mination, then there should be little
risk of Australia’s help being mis-
understood.
from the broadcast
. . . This Is something you must
understand about Asia and the younger
generation in Asia. You can’t tell them
that Communism is an unmitigated
evil, all Communists are wicked men.
It’s not true. If they are, how do you
account for the progress, the dedica-
tion, the drive, the energy, which has
inspired construction in Communist
countries? I don't agree with the
regime and I would probably do very
badly in a Communist regime. To
begin with, I don’t think they would
put up with my holding dissenting
views from them, that’s most un-
fortunate for me and therefore I make
sure that they don’t ever get into a
position where they can scrub out
any dissenting view, because that’s
what I am quite sure they will do. . .
But we are non-Communist in a very
fundamental way and as fundamental
to the Communists as to the West.
You see when we say non-Communist,
the West is not satisfied they say, ah,
equivocation, fellow-traveller. Well,
maybe, I don’t think so. The Com-
munists know what non-Communism
means. It means no Communism,
that’s why it’s non, no Communism in
Singapore, in Malaysia. Which means
they’ve got to fight us and which
means we’ve got to fight them. But
in fighting them, we don’t necessarily
have to become British or American
stooges, we are fighting for ourselves.

THIS AUSTRALIA
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Beazley’s Best Yet
A mixed week for Mr Calwell
G. WHITLAM
K. BEAZLEY
A. CALWELL
By Alan Reid
CANBERRA The Federal Opposi-
tion Leader, Mr A. Calwell, last week
had two field days in the Labor Caucus,
but in the Parliament with international
affairs under discussion the Labor Party
revealed that this subject has the capacity
to divide its ranks to a degree probably
unrivalled in recent years by anything
outside sectarianism.
Mr Kim Beazley got off a plane from
Western Australia —where he had been
detained trying to protect West Aus-
tralian Labor Leader Bert Hawke from
attack on the West Ausralian ALP
executive —and was raced to Parliament
House to follow Mr Calwell and Dr
Cairns in the debate. Beazley entered
the Chamber of the House of Representa-
tives without knowing what Mr Calwell
had said, and when Dr Cairns was finish-
ing his speech. He immediately pro-
ceeded to shoot both of them down in
flames. Their theme was that there must
be negotiation in Vietnam. They wanted
a settlement.
Beazley put the issue of negotiation on
the line in one of the most telling
speeches delivered in the House of Rep-
resentatives for years, and which received
very little publicity outside the Parlia-
ment where it was hailed as Beazley’s
best yet. Said Beazley: “There have been
a number of demands directed at the
United States that it should negotiate on
the subject of Vietnam. There is develop-
ing in some countries of the Western
World almost a philosophy of demanding
the getting out of such situations as that
in Vietnam. The only thing I would like
to say about this getting out philosophy
is that it does not go far enough.
“I am all in favor of the West getting
out of Berlin if the Soviet gets out of
East Germany. There is a very strong
case for the US getting out of Vietnam
and allowing self-determination there, but
there is precisely the same case for the
Soviet Union getting out of Hungary
and allowing self-determination there.
There is a perfect willingness on the part
of China to negotiate on how the US
gets out of South Vietnam but not on
whether it gets out. Mr Khrushchev,
before his fall, said the question of
Russian withdrawal from Hungary was
not negotiable. We have this Leninist
philosophy of negotiation that you
negotiate only on those subjects which
advance your power, and you do not
negotiate on those subjects which retreat
your power.”
Uncharacteristically turning his back
on the Government benches to address
those on the Labor side, Beazley said:
“It does not matter who signs letters to
the newspapers advocating a negotiation.
All they advertise is their own blindness.
I am in favor of the lot of them getting
out and allowing the peoples of the
occupied countries to determine their
own fate. But I am not in favor of the
selective argument that demands that
the West should permanently abandon
positions because we are frightened and
truckling to those who threaten, while
we will not make a stand and ask others
to leave territories they ought not to be
occupying.
“Are the people who are advocating
U.S. negotiation in Vietnam in fact
advocating U.S. to surrender? If we
demand that the US shall negotiate, what
are we demanding the US shall negotiate
about? That has to be clearly and
honestly stated.
“If in fact we are not really talking
about surrendering and getting out, we
should say so. If the US forces do have
an armistice for negotiation and as a
consequence forfeit certain favorable
military positions and then the negotia-
tions break down, who pays in blood for
the retrieving of those positions? Do we
or do they? This is an elementary
responsibility. Otherwise we are just
irresponsible dabblers.”
Beazley’s speech and the speeches
which followed, showed the fundamental
divisions in Labor’s ranks on this ques-
tion. Labor speakers who supported the
Beazley viewpoint were matched by those
who insisted that there should be negotia-
tion and who ignored the Beazley thesis.
In Caucus Mr G. Whitlam amazingly
allowed himself to be trapped into
supporting a proposal that the party's
policy on Vietnam and Malaysia should
be referred to ALP Federal machine
authorities, who on international affairs
hold views almost diametrically opposed
to those held by probably the majority
of the parliamentary Labor Caucus.
These views were reflected by the largely
Right-wing Parliamentary Foreign Affairs
committee and endorsed by the Federal
Parliamentary executive in Sydney during
the Parliamentary recess.
Mr Calwell must have enjoyed him-
self as his deputy floundered in a morass
of his own making. While he was cam-
paigning for internal ALP reform and
the widening of the Federal ALP con-
ference to lessen the overwhelming
power exerted upon the ALP Federal
structure by Communist - influenced
unions, Whitlam looked as though he
could, and would, secure the support of
the Right-wing in either a straightout bid
to secure the Federal Labor leadership
or in creating a situation in which things
would become so uncomfortable for Mr
Calwell that he would be forced to
resign.
But as Right-wingers themselves are
now asking, “how can we support
Whitlam after last week’s performance?
He might talk about the necessity for
internal reformation and widening of
the Party’s Federal base. But when the
chips were down he was advocating the
referral of policies formulated by Parlia-
mentarians to the very people whom he
had strongly criticised.”
My judgment is that now Whitlam
does not loom nearly so large in Mr
Calwell’s calculations about his likely
future within the Labor Party as he did
recently. Mr Calwell, rather than ask
him directly for his recent speeches on
his leadership intentions, had requested
the ALP Federal Secretary, Mr Cyril
Wyndham, to get for his perusal tran-


scripts of recent Whitlam TV shows and
statements. The Left-wing cannot be
too happy with Mr Calwell. They
believed that he proposed to support
them and Whitlam in the move to
have the Vietnam and Malaysia policy
referred to the ALP Federal executive.
In point of fact, Mr Calwell did not
support them. He did not give a view
one way or another.
Furthermore, it was the Right wing
that was given the run of the Caucus
race. Mr Calwell as Caucus chairman
calls the speakers. One after another he
called Right-wing speakers likely to be
most effective in persuading Caucus into
rejecting the move to have the issues
referred to the ALP executive. Like a
well regulated piece of clockwork, the
call went to the Senate Labor Leader
Nick McKenna, his deputy, Pat Ken-
nelly, Tony Luchetti, a respected member
of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party
executive, and others who could put the
Right-wing viewpoint forcibly and per-
suasively.
After the vote was taken and they
found themselves defeated and the Right-
wing’s Vietnam and Malaysian policy
re-endorsed, the more objective of the
Left-wingers congratulated the Right-
wingers upon the magnificence of their
organisaion. Only then did the Left
wing learn that the Right wing had not
organised. It was not even aware before
the Caucus meeting that the motion of
reference to the Federal ALP executive
was to be moved. The first they knew
of it was when Mr Nicholls (Labor, SA)
moved it. It was the sequence in which
Mr Calwell called speakers from both
sides that gave the impression that the
Rightwing had done a particularly able
piece of organising.
For Calwell, it was a mixed week with
a happy outcome in the Caucus and a
less happy result in the Parliamentary
discussions on foreign affairs.
THE MARTIN REPORT
A College Education
No cheers from Mr Bolle
MELBOURNE If there were not
the full three cheers everywhere for the
Federal Government's plans to imple-
ment the recommendations of the Martin
Report on tertiary education, there were
in most places at least two. Most places,
that is except in Victoria where Premier
Mr H. Bolte said he was “perturbed and
disappointed” that, in tabling the report,
Sir Robert Menzies had decreed Vic-
toria’s Institute of Colleges should oper-
ate only at diploma standard.
Sir Robert had said that the Martin
committee's recommendation on the ex-
pansion of technical colleges to provide a
new concept of tertiary education —
somewhere between high school and
university graduation—was the “heart of
the report”. Mr Bolte was disappointed
because Sir Robert “supported the theory
H. BOLTE
of the report but is not prepared to pay
for it all”. Mr Bolte had campaigned
electorally on promises that country
centres and some metropolitan areas
would have their technical institutes
raised to degree status. Although “The
Age” warned him editorially that he
should not try to “go it alone”, he seemed
hardly in the mood to heed; the Federal
Government were “Johnnies come lately”
in the education field and he was not
going to be “dictated to” by Canberra.
But just what was the theory of the
report? Sir Leslie Martin, the chairman
of the committee of 16 academics, edu-
cationists and businessmen, which pre-
sented the main two volumes to the
Government last August, seemed himself
uncertain. At first he made it diploma-
tically clear that Mr Bolte had read be-
J. GORTON
tween the lines messages that were not
there. Sir Leslie agreed that Mr Bolte
apparently had definite ideas on granting
degrees in technical colleges—but he
was reported to say that this had never
been the intention of the committee. But
the next day Mr Bolte released the text
of a letter he had received from Sir
Leslie in April, 1964. He said the letter
clearly indicated that the committee
would recommend financial aid to lift
technical colleges above diploma status.
Said Sir Leslie: “If anyone reads my let-
ter and reads the report, they will find
that they are the same.”
Sir Leslie said that the committee had
recommended that in certain disciplines
post-diploma courses should be created
leading to a Bachelor of Technology
degree and that the colleges should be
allowed to grow in stature. Mr Bolte
has obviously taken this as carte blanche.
Victoria has the lowest ratio of uni-
versity students to population of the six
States. Mr Bolte no doubt had hoped
for greater support from the Martin re-
port in his effort to legislate his State to
the top of the statistical table. But after
Mr Bolte has found the money and the
staff he may then have to find the
students. The suggestion is already
abroad that a BA or BEc. from Footscray
Tech, will not be amongst the most
highly prized academic honors of the
nation. In accepting a college system
based on the American model the Fed-
eral Government was introducing some-
thing so potentially far-reaching in its
effects that first reactions generally were
cautiously optimistic and tentative.
There was some further disappoint-
ment, summed up by the Professor of
Education at Sydney University, Pro-
fessor W. S. Connell, that the Govern-
ment had rejected the committee’s re-
commendation on teacher training. One
of the major proposals this, it called for
the reorganisation of teacher training
under a board of teacher education in
each State and advocated regular Federal
grants to help finance the scheme.
For the rest, most of the recommenda-
tions will be carried out —by Senator
Gorton’s expanding Department of Edu-
cation. Apart from the colleges plan,
which will cost £5B million in its first
three years of operation (the States pro-
viding £34 million), the Government will
also increase Commonwealth scholar-
ships by 2250 to 8780 next year, includ-
ing 1000 to the new colleges. It will
also provide grants on a pound-for-
pound basis with the States of
£1,225,000 to help development at La-
trobe in Victoria, Macquarie in NSW,
Adelaide University at Bedford Park,
Townsville University College, New-
castle University and Brisbane’s second
university.

MALAYSIA
Not as a Tourist
Reporting Lee’s Image
SYDNEY When Mr Lee Kuan
Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore, leaves
Australia this week he will have made
sure that what he did and said here was
fully reported in sound and word, in
Malay, Chinese and English. With him,
presumably at his Government’s expense,
were a reporting team consisting of a
Press officer, a movie cameraman, and
two Radio Singapore reporters, one of
them Miss Lee Siok Tin who was
frequently mistaken for Mrs Lee’s sister
or daughter, and the political secretary
to the Singapore Minister for Culture,
Inche Ghazali Bin Ismail. (In Singapore
Mr Lee Kuan Yew controls the State's
radio and television stations. His Ministry
of Culture publishes a stream of booklets
and magazines, and while Singapore’s
newspapers are privately owned, most of
them are sympathetic toward Mr Lee’s
Government.)
When Mr Lee leaves Perth for Singa-
pore on Friday he will have spent the
best part of 17 days in Australia. When
asked the real purpose of his visit, he said
he had come to get to know Australia
and Australians and to educate himself.
At the same time, he always added, be
wanted to make sure that Australian
political leaders, the Prime Minister and
members of the Cabinet, as well as the
Leader of the Opposition, and prominent
members of the Australian Labor Party,
fully understood why Malaysia deserved
Australia’s strongest support.
In Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide and Perth, Mr Lee, helped by
his efficient team, draped with movie
cameras, still cameras, powerful lights,
tape recorders, and the like, worked hard
at his self-imposed task. At airports,
hotels, television and radio stations, even
on the golf course, Mr Lee willingly met
the Press. Towards the end of his tour,
if not earlier, it became increasingly
apparent that Mr Lee was doing more
than educating himself, and explaining
Malaysia. Stress was heavily laid upon
the need for Australia to support the
concept of Malaysia, and not any par-
ticular regime in Malaysia. Who was
Mr Lee warning? Australia, or Kuala
Lumpur?
XT is meetings with the ALP were
especially useful. There is now more
than a possibility that Australian socialists
will establish firmer contacts with Afro-
Asian socialists. There have always been
links between Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s
Peoples’ Action Party and the ALP. In
Australia, Mr Lee has been able to
strengthen these ties. A closer relation-
ship is likely to follow the Prime
Minister’s long conversation with Mr
A. E. Monk, president of the Australian
Council of Trade Unions. Singapore's
Arbitration Court is modelled on Aus-
tralia’s experiences, and in Melbolirne
Mr Lee made a point of meeting Mr
H. A. Bland, the Ministry of Labor’s
senior officer, the man directly re-
sponsible for establishing the Singapore
LEE KUAN YEW
Court, and discussing developments with
him.
In addition to meeting Ministers of
Government, leaders of the Opposition,
and socialists and trade unionists, Mr Lee
met, lunched with, and talked to some
500 Australian industrialists and business-
men.
What was the hidden purpose of this
reminder? Mr Lee said Malaysia could
win a great deal of support and sympathy
from the uncommitted nations if the
world knew that Australia supported a
Malaysian concept, not a particular
Malaysian Government. Australia’s
official policy, never questioned even by
the Opposition, is, of course, based upon
support for a democratic multi-racial
Malaysia. Mr Lee knew this before he
came to Canberra, where he saw Sir
Robert Menzies and most of the Cabinet.
Nevertheless, Mr Lee never missed a
chance to hammer away at this theme
whenever he met the Press or students.
His intention, probably the real purpose
of his tour of part of the country, was
understood, especially in Canberra. It
always has been.
Vet Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s presence in
A Australia was worthwhile. General
consensus was that he lived up to his
reputation as being one of the toughest
of the intelligent leaders of Asia. His
energy was remarkable. He thought
nothing of answering Press questions for
an hour, then giving three television and
five radio reporters separate interviews
immediately afterwards. His own report-
ing team covered everything. On the
same day the tapes and the films were
air-expressed back to Singapore. Once
a week there was a direct broadcast ro
Radio Singapore, when summaries were
given in Malay, Chinese and English.
Singapore knew in detail just what it was
that their Prime Minister was saying in
Australia. Perhaps more important to
Mr Lee, so did Kuala Lumpur.
Part of Mr Lee’s personal success in
Australia was due to the fact that his
criticisms and comments were widely
cast, and his reflections upon South-East
Asian affairs frank and sensible if you
agreed with them, and well-reasoned,
genuinely-held, though mistaken, if you
did not.
There is plenty of evidence that Mr
Lee worked hard at explaining Malaysia
to Australians. How well did he succeed
in his declared intention to educate him-
self? There was not much time for sight-
seeing. He saw the inside of some of our
universities, and Parliaments. He is now
no longer a stranger to at least 11 Aus-
tralian golf courses, and Norman von
Nida considerably educated his swing.
But Mr Lee leaves Australia without see-
ing a kangaroo, or watching an expert
throw a boomerang. He spent no time at
all on an Australian farm. This will pro-
bably cause the immaculately dressed Mr
Lee no distress. He did not come as a
tourist. This was not the sort of education
he sought in Australia.
Whatever the real purpose of his visit,
Mr Lee Kuan Yew proved himself a
good ambassador for Malaysia. He goes
back to Singapore, his reputation as a
brilliant, tough Asian politician un-
tarnished. Whether this will be appreci-
ated by his fierce critics in Malaysia,
whether his Australian venture will lead
to an improvement in the present strained
relationship between Mr Lee’s Govern-
ment and the Tunku’s Government in
Kuala Lumpur, is Mr Lee’s affair.


SHIPPING
On the Rocks
Miller and his tankers
SYDNEY : The recent announce-
ment that, because of “harsh discrimina-
tory measures” taken by the large petro-
leum companies, the three R. W. Miller
(Holdings) Ltd tankers were for sale,
brought home forcibly that at long last
Rod Miller’s shaky honeymoon with
the Seamen’s Union General Secretary
Elliot V. Elliott was on the rocks and his
“noble dream” of an Australian tanker
fleet on a lee shore.
Yet the warnings were visible as far
back as June, 1963, when Mr Miller first
made his bid to enter the Australian
coastal oil transport business. Sir Robert
Menzies was on the eve of leaving for an
overseas trip when Miller revealed he
had asked the Federal Government to
subsidise the construction of nine
20,000-ton oil tankers for the local trade.
At a hurriedly assembled Press confer-
ence Mr Miller said he had asked the
Government to pay 33£ per cent sub-
sidy on the tankers, each of which was
estimated to cost about £3 million. The
Miller tankers were to operate between
oil refineries and oil depots scattered
along the coastline and the larger sea-
board cities and would replace 11 over-
seas tankers then plying under special
licence. Miller’s lever was that the Navi-
gation Act of 1906 gives Australian
owned and crewed vessels, operating
under Australian Articles, absolute
priority for cargoes over foreign ships.
Until then overseas vessels, available for
charter at far lower rates than any Aus-
tralian tanker ever would be, were being
used exclusively by the petroleum firms.
Without waiting for a Federal Govern-
ment reply to his proposal, Mr Miller
announced he would purchase six over-
seas tankers for temporary use until the
nine Australian vessels could be built.
Further, he was so confident his all-Aus-
tralian plans would be welcomed by all,
he had bought the 10,000-ton tanker
Merchant Knight and would refit it for
local service immediately.
In June, 1963, the Prime Minister cut
through a seemingly endless round of
bickering and arguments by informing
Miller that he could import the Merchant
Knight (re-named Miller’s Canopus),
on the conditions that it operated under
Australian Articles and on the coast. Mil-
ler and his supporters welcomed this an-
nouncement, but it was a bitter blow to
the big oil combines.
Miller planned to collect his first con-
signment of oil for shipment to the
eastern States from the BP refinery at
Kwinana, near Fremantle, but, if BP had
anything to say about the matter, the
cargo was not going to be an easy one
to collect. Negotiation after negotiation
between Miller’s and BP broke down,
and eventually Mr Miller was forced tb
radio the master of the Canopus to de-
mand cargo the moment he berthed at
Kwinana. This the tanker’s master could
do under the Navigation Act, but he was
spared the necessity of taking the matter
to such an extreme by another swift Mil-
ler move. A plane-load of Miller execu-
tives including the chief himself,
suddenly flew to Kwinana, where the BP
hierarchy already was encamped waiting
to do battle. There, Mr Miller and the
Kwinana company’s managing director,
Mr L. R. Gascoine settled into a mara-
thon eight-hour conference which ended
in agreement. .
Less than 24 hours before the Canopus
was due to arrive, Miller and Gascoine
signed documents chartering the tanker
MILLER'S CANOPUS
to load and deliver 15,000 tons of motor
spirit to the eastern states. No sooner
had the Canopus delivered her cargo than
BP and Shell announced plans to pur-
chase overseas tankers and use them on
the Australian coast, so cutting Miller’s
throat from another angle. Seemingly
undeterred, Miller’s countered by reveal-
ing that they were negotiating for two
more tankers, to be re-named Miller’s
Macarthur and the R. W. Miller.
Throughout last year Miller’s noticed a
worrying pattern developing, at first
slowly, and then increasingly, in their
dealings with the petroleum companies.
For a month or so the three Miller
ships would be kept busy ferrying
cargoes around the coast; so busy, in fact,
that they were unable to handle all the
shipments the oil firms wished trans-
ported. So the oil companies were
“forced” to invoke a section of the Navi-
gation Act which permits the use of
foreign-flag ships on the Australian run,
if locals vessels are unavailable.
“Then, the following month,” Mr
Miller claims, “the oil companies, having
rushed to stock their refineries and depots
to capacity, say there is no work for my
boats”.
Meanwhile, at a compulsory conference
between all parties in the dispute held
in Sydney last Friday before Mr Justice
Gallagher, the deputy president of the
Commonwealth Arbitration Commission,
Miller and Elliott agreed to “hold fire”
for a trial period. This trial period was
ordered by the Minister for Shipping,
Mr Freeth, during which all applications
for the use of foreign flag ships would
have to be made on the condition that
the department was satisfied that no
openings existed for Australian ships.

CENSORSHIP
“On Dit”
Murdoch steals a march
ADELAIDE The current issue of
the Adelaide University student news-
paper ‘‘On Dit” has a small, front-page
story announcing that News Ltd has re-
placed a scholarship withdrawn by
Advertiser Newspapers Ltd. The article
says: “ ‘On Dit’ will gain much by its
association with the ‘News’ since it is a
member of Mr Rupert Murdoch’s news-
paper fleet, the flagship of which is ‘The
Australian’.”
Seven months ago the “Advertiser”
informed the editors of “On Dit” it was
discontinuing its annual £2OO scholarship
to the editors. The editors asked why,
and received a reply from the “Adver-
tiser’s” managing editor, Mr B. A.
Williams, saying the decision would
remain firm and adding that he had
received no reply to an earlier letter
asking the editors to “have a talk about
some material appearing in ‘On Dit'.”
The editors published the reply, in which
Mr Williams said he had “pointed out
then (in the earlier letter) that as one of
our subsidiaries, the Griffin Press, printed
‘On Dit’, I was a little concerned about
the legal implications for us of some of
the material published in ‘On Dit’.”
In a caustic article in “On Dit”, student
Gordon Bilney examined possible reasons
for the Advertiser’s action. A lawyer
advised that none of the material printed
in “On Dit” during the year was action-
able and Bilney found, in addition, that
the Griffin Press, apparently far from
being concerned with “legal implications”
would continue to print “On Dit”.
This led Bilney and everyone else
following the matter to the conclusion
that the “Advertiser's” objection involved
“the quantity of criticism of established
institutions” on “On Dit”. Now Mr
Murdoch appears to have struck another
blow against censorship, while stealing a
march on Adelaide’s Establishment.

Law in Trust
The Fidelity Guarantee Fund
SYDNEY The Law Society of
NSW still has under consideration pro-
posals to amend sections of the Legal
Practitioners Act to allow it to obtain
interest on part of trust accounts for use
in subsidising the Solicitors’ Fidelity
Guarantee, despite the fact that earlier
this month the proposals were defeated
by 300 votes in a postal ballot.
Briefly, the society wants, or perhaps
at the time of the ballot wanted, half
of the trust account held by a solicitor
on current account placed in the bank
on a fixed deposit in the name of the
society as trustee. The interest earned
in this manner would, claimed the
society, avoid delay in making payments
to claimants, paying them in full and
building up the capital of the fund. But
a group of forceful solicitors succeeded
in gaining sufficient support to defeat
the proposals. At the same time, how-
ever, this group successfully moved that
the proposals be reconsidered by the
society’s council.
Obviously, the society has a difficult
task in producing a measure which will
meet with the approval of its 2900 mem-
bers and, logically, changes will have to
be made. One of these, for example,
could be the reduction in the proportion
of the lowest balance of a solicitor’s
trust account upon which interest is to
be earned to one-third—in line with the
Victorian legislation introduced last
yekr. In addition to this the cheque for
that, proportion may possibly be drawn
in favor of a special trust deposit account
in the name of the solicitor, rather than
the society.
According to defenders of the scheme,
neither of these changes would be neces-
sary if the Associated Banks were to
change their previous attitude and allow
a small rate of interest on current daily
balances in solicitors’ trust accounts. Two
other possible changes may be that the
Reserve Guarantee Fund will be used
entirely and exclusively restricted to
meet claims by clients and the expenses
of receivership until the fund reaches
£500,000; and that thereafter if in any
year there is an excess of income over
those requirements the surplus "will be
applied for such purposes as agreed upon
by the council and the Associated Banks.

Bramston
The dentist strikes again
SYDNEY The Brisbane dentist,
Alan Russell, who found “95 blasphe-
mies, 14 swear-words and five visual acts
of indecency” in the Australian produc-
tion of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?”, and who will seek from the
Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, a
full investigation into .the affairs of the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust, has made
further discoveries. Last week he cabled
The Bulletin criticising the “Mavis
Bramston Show” and says that this will
also be mentioned in his representations
to Federal Parliament on the “Woolf”
production.
The telegram reads:
“The Ampol-sponsored Mavis Bram-
ston TV show is excessively indecent.
When a woman says ‘I am on heat’, or
a youth says ‘I had my first jumjp (slang
for intercourse) at 16 and have been
jumping ever since’, I claim that great
harm is done to our Australian youth.
As a citizen I say Ampol gravely under-
estimates the moral standards of the
average Australian man and woman.
“As the father of a 16-year-old lad I
entreat Ampol to abandon this type of
advertising and give our youth a better
chance of growing up decently. Aus-
tralian youth is now guided towards
clean living by the co-operation of
parents, teachers, policemen, church
workers, youth leaders and other public-
spirited citizens, but these efforts are
now being sabotaged by Ampol.
“ ‘The Bramston Show’ was described
last Sunday by the ‘Brisbane Truth’ as
‘sleazy, smirking smut for smut’s sake’,
The keynote of oil industries’ public re-
lations is service, but the Ampol ‘Bram-
ston Show’ does great disservice to the
nation. Impressionable adolescents are
sitting shots for these performers. To
preserve the oil industries’ reputation of
clean advertising, I suggest that other
oil companies counsel Ampol to cease
this morally reprehensible programme,
“Meanwhile, as an instance of gross
TV obscenity, I intend naming Ampol
Company and ‘Mavis Bramston Show’
alongside the Elizabethan Theatre Trust
and the ‘Virginia Woolf play in my re-
presentations to the Federal Parliament
and Prime Minister requesting legisla-
tive action.

The Canterbury
Testament Today
No barometer to judge High or Low pressures
By PATRICK TENNISON
Arthur Michael Ramsey at first
viewing strikes you as a huge, de-
cidely Old Testament figure. The
bald head fringed with the shaggy, grey
thatch . . . the plasticity of the big face
that shines with vast serenity one minute,
can darken into ominous rumbling dis-
gruntlement the next . . . the great, com-
manding bulk of this tall, corpulent body,
yet the masterfully gliding walk he
agilely moves it with. When he raises his
right arm in a funny sort of wave-salute-
blessing to a crowd, you feel it could be
Abraham holding a sword, Moses part-
ing a sea, a now-pensioned Daniel still
quietly acknowledging plaudits for earlier
achievements among lions.
He seems tremendously unflappable.
When he arrived at Melbourne Airport
last weekend, Archbishop Woods intro-
duced me mistakenly as the airport
manager. Since the real one didn’t seem
around, I accepted the role, and dutifully
led the rather large ecclesiastical squad
of welcomers and welcomed to the pre-
pared reception-room, showed the English
Primate to the biggest chair, pulled out
a pen and pad and began asking ques-
tions. He responded by answering them
with complete ease and spontaneity, as
if all his life he was accustomed to long
interviews by airport managers as part of
his travel ritual.
Sydney, which he had left two days
earlier, had obviously annoyed him.
Carefully—though he made it seem
almost casual the way he did it—he
expressed his disapproval in the simple
language of the master diplomat-theolo-
gian he is. In some respects, he said,
the Church in Australia was behind. In
others ahead. He tackled the “ahead”
category first:
“It’s most go-ahead in its liveliness and
out-goingness to the community and, for
the most part, its agreeableness for unity
with other Churches.
“Then there’s the behind part. < Some
parts of the Australian Church are behind
in continuing ' narrow partisanship be-
tween High and Low Church. Sydney,
for instance, has one particular color of
churchmanship. There ought to be differ-
ences of churchmanship, but a diocese
ought to mix its colors. Far more needs
to be done between such divisions, for
they have much to learn from each
other.”
No, he didn’t want to elaborate fur-
ther. His grieved look eased when I
jokingly asked if he had brought some
sort of ecclesiastical barometer to keep
informed whether pressures in places he
was visiting were High or Low. “An in-
telligent person picks up the character of
a place quickly on arrival,” he grinned,
with a wave of the hand dismissing that
subject.
Otherwise, his visit so far had been
apparently pleasant:
“I’m enjoying myself immensely,” he
said with the happy air of someone who
truly likes enjoying himself immensely.
“I’m fascinated by this country as a
whole and particularly struck by its great
concern about Christian unity. I’ve been
especially interested in contacts I’ve had
with university students here. I’m aware
of a considerable new Christian element
in universities.”
And he would elaborate on a statement
he had made in Canberra that Christian-
ity had “gone stale”.
“In Australia as in England we inheri-
ted centuries of tradition of Christian
civilisation. Now it’s being too much
taken for granted. We tend to accept the
civilisation and not the Christianity. The
Churches find themselves in the situation
of doing their best to grapple with this,
but they are not able to communicate
with all the people.
“People talk about science out-dating
religion. Both science and religion should
be taught and understood because both
are necessary for an understanding of
the world and it’s necessary for both to
understand each other.
“Religion is a tough old thing. But if
it is to play its part in the world com-
munity it must use one of its essential
characteristics of getting close to people.
Today there are far more people than
previously who ignore religion. But
where people pay attention, it is for the
purpose of respecting it.”
He sees young people especially with
a key part to play here.
“I’m all for youth. We often don’t
expect young people to be Christians at
all, but when they are they are extremely
good stuff. I think it would often be
better for some of the young people to
show us.”
But, very firmly, he doesn’t believe
gimmicks like jazz concerts in or after
Church services are much help.
“With religion, jazz doesn’t really click
as it should. I’d rather they try to bring
some of our own Church music up to
date.”
Without any eyelid-batting, he joins
his predecessor, Archbishop Fisher, in
advocating that the Church here change
its present unwieldy title of The Church
of England in Australia.
“There seems to be every reason for
giving up this name Church of England
here. You’ve an autonomous Church
now. Anglican is a very good name and
there seems no reason why you shouldn’t
use that.”
To questions aimed on a strictly per-
sonal level, he was, at first anyway, rather
wary. In an embarrasscdly humble way,
he seems more at home in a pulpit or on
religio-philosophic ground than in any

self-revelatory snug armchair. In this
domain, too, his slight stammer was
noticeably more evident.
He parried, for instance, when I asked
if all his duties and work left him much
time for prayer.
“I often wish that I used it better than
I do use it. Prayer is an absolute priority
of Christian life.”
He refused, however, to answer my
follow-up question on the amount of time
he spent in prayer. “No, that’s a ques-
tion I won’t answer,” he said flatly but
with no withdrawal of warmth.
Well, would he say what he prayed
for when he did pray? “I pray for the
things I care about and for my own in-
adequacies to be overcome,” he hedged,
but neatly.
Does he enjoy his job? “Yes, I do,”
he said decisively. “It’s the last one I
would have chosen, but in spite of every-
thing I’m happy with it. No, I’ve never
been ambitious. I simply do the job I’m
asked to do.”
In what ways did his present job as
Canterbury differ from his previous one
as York? “York was less involved in
everything. It was a relatively light job.
Canterbury has to be involved so much
in everything.”
rim he find a sense of humor essential?
“Oh, yes,” and he chuckled appre-
ciatively. “The bigger the job the more
a sense of humor is requisite. You
really need a sense of humor in this
job.”
Relaxations? “I get very little time for
relaxation, but fortunately I have a gift
of relaxing easily. I like reading and
walking and I do a little painting when
I can.
“The last book I read? Let me see . . .
it was about the Church in North Queens-
land. ‘Christ in the Tropics’ I think it
was called. I don’t read much fiction.
I'm especially fond of biography.
Soldiers, explorers and whatnot.”
Did he ever find the glamor of his
work disturbing? He seemed surprised,
checked the word “glamor” back to
ensure he heard correctly before answer-
ing:
“I don’t see any glamor in it. To me
my job doesn’t seem very glamorous at
all. Ido my duty to God and I’m inter-
ested in people rather than the trap-
pings.”
How did he keep fit? “I always take
a lot of exercise and I’ve always played
games. I played all sorts of games at
school and university. Football, cricket,
hockey. Never wrestling, but just about
everything else. I played them for plea-
sure and exercise only. I never played
for my school or college and f never
made a cult out of sport. I enjoyed it.
“No, I’m not a teetotaller. I’ve never
thought it necessary.”
The most important aspect of his work
today, he believes, is the movement for
Church unity—“l don’t think there’s any-
thing more important. It goes hand in
hand with great missionary work.
“I see ecumenism coming in two stages.
The first will be getting really friendly
relations between the Churches so they
treat one another as allies, not rivals.
This first is really going ahead.
“The second will be actual uniting of
the Churches together. This is moving
slowly but it is happening. In Nigeria,
the Anglicans, Presbyterians and Metho-
dists will be united by the end of this
year. In England, the Methodists and
Anglicans are trying. Here, the Angli-
cans and Free Churches are making
efforts to unite.”
With all this, however, he does not
expect the Anglican communion to dis-
appear as some predict: “Bits of it will,
but this will be more than made up for
by what comes from others being in
union with us.”
He can also show tolerance—to a point
—towards today’s crop of anti-ecumeni-
cals. “I can understand their feelings.
There are some old practices that people
had to fight for for conscience’ sake and
in times when differences did have a
purpose. I can understand the feelings
of these people—but they are funda-
mentally wrong-headed.”
Had any Australian churchmen sought
his advice on anything? “I’m constantly
giving advice, but I didn't come to Aus-
tralia primarily to give advice,” he gave
a humorous sideways glance at the group
of local hierarchy waiting patiently near-
by. “I’m here more as a learner. No
matter what your age or position, there
is always something to learn.”
He eased himself nimbly from his
chair, was gathered up by his distin-
guished welcomers and, his pontifical
viewpoints delivered, a few seconds later
was enjoying himself just as much
merrily signing autographs for a waiting
group of teenage hunters.
AIF aspects of his work seem to come
extraordinarily easily for this quite
extraordinary man.

An Open Letter
to the Australian
Swimming Union
From JACK POLLARD
Gentlemen: Few Australians have a
daffodil and an orchid named after
them. Fewer still are arrested for
pinching an Emperor’s flag, are accused
of clobbering an Olympic team-mate,
are elected ABC Sportsman of the Year,
and, crowning glory, are driven up the
straight at Flemington on Cup Day.
Dawn Fraser has done all this and
more. She had made the transition from
a Sydney dockside slum to international
fame and remained remarkably free of
humbug and phoney self-importance.
She is an exceptional figure, tremen-
dously gifted but essentially earthy. You
have shown, however, that you are not
prepared to treat her as an uncommon
character through the savagery with
which you have punished her failure to
conform. She is an unconventional girl,
sure, but your organisation has shown
itself unwilling to live with any non-
conformity.
Dawn Fraser has been asthmatic all her
life and allergic to chlorine, but she has
been the fastest woman swimmer in
history, with more than 40 world records
to her name and an unprecedented three
successive Olympic titles. Surely that
record is worth something, but you have
chosen to ignore it in handing her a 10-
year suspension which virtually ends her
career. In my view her suspension
should be reduced immediately along
with the penalties imposed on Marlene
Dayman, Nan Duncan and Linda
McGill.
Premiers have defended her, she has
lunched with the Queen, earned hun-
dreds of pounds for charities, supporting,
with personal appearances, everything
from heart research to blood banks.
She even sold kisses at two dollars a
time in the rocket town, Woomera.
Not many Australians have ever been
so headline-prone, but you seem to envy
her her fame. She has been thrown into
an Adelaide police cell, had the preacher
lecture her husband on television at the
wedding altar. Before that much bally-
hooed wedding she had had 200 mar-
riage proposals, including one from a
prisoner in Long Bay gaol.
Somehow when Fraser has an orchid
or a daffodil named after her they win
prize ribbons. The racehorse she got for
an engagement present actually wins
races. The day she was arrested after
a chase through the palace gardens in
Tokyo was the very day she carried the
Australian banner in the Olympic sta-
dium. When she became a champion
of amateurism it was found she had been
branded a professional years before when
'she was 14. It's pretty hard to com-
pete with this kind of thing.
Part of her headline-making stems
from a candor which has always irked
you, gentlemen. She is astoundingly free
of airs and graces, some say naively
honest. When she became the first
woman to swim 100 metres inside a
minute a Pressman asked how she would
celebrate. She said she would go to a
party and drink a lot of beer and get a
little tight. You officials objected to
that at the poolside and told her she
should not mention beer drinking. She
said she would not be two-faced about
it. If people were upset because she
had a few beers, she was sorry, but she
was not going to be sanctimonious about
it.
And you certainly didn’t like her sug-
gestion that the way to further reduce
swimming records was to swim in the
nude. Swimmers have been shaving the
hairs from their legs for years and swim-
suits have been getting tighter and lighter
in the effort to reduce body resistance to
water. At a time when we've gone
almost as far as we can go in physical
conditioning, nude swimming against the
clock makes sense. But you consider
that view unladylike.
The public stand in awe of Fraser’s
great physical power, but you give her
no credit for the thousands of hours she
has put into developing that strength.
It’s as if you regard swimming for six
hours a day to gain perfection as com-
monplace.
Before the Rome Olympics in 1960 I
wrote a story for the “Sunday Telegraph”
suggesting Fraser should be given the
honor of carrying Australia's flag into
the Olympic stadium at the opening cere-
mony. You scoffed at the idea and
said no woman would be strong enough
to carry a heavy flag and stand for so
long in the hot sun. I asked Dawn
what she thought of that and she said
if she was given the job she could do it
with two wrestlers on her back. Judging
by the letters I got from readers, Aus-
tralians believed she could have done,
too.
When she finally was given the task
of carrying Australia’s flag into an Olym-
pic stadium at the Tokyo Games’ closing
ceremony she did the job with heavy
bandages protecting a badly swollen
ankle —hurt earlier that day in her en-
counter with the Tokyo police.
Granted, she is a gameswoman who

occasionally kids opponents into false
starts or makes remarks designed to lower
their confidence. But it’s a rugged, no-
holds-barred world at the top in most
international sports and champions soon
learn to live with that. It’s part of the
game.
She so enjoys the crowds and the
limelight she cannot resist playing up to
spectators and joshing those who feel
nervous before crowds. Back in 1960 she
was so relaxed and nerveless before an
Olympic 100 metres trial in Sydney she
forgot to put her swimsuit on. When
she started to peel off her tracksuit an
official spotted the lack of a suit. They
had to hold up the start of the race while
Dawn got into her costume.
Fraser’s loyalty to her friends is well
known. One of the charges against her
in Tokyo was that she refused to wear
the official team costume. The fact is
she had the costume remade once be-
cause it restricted her breathing. Even
the alterations did not make her happy
with the suit so she wore one she liked
which was not the official uniform. This
may sound a small thing but in the
struggle to win Olympic titles even small
items like this can upset competitors
psychologically. When the 100 metres
final arrived she heard that her friend
Len Curnow, general manager of the
Australian team, would be in trouble if
she failed to wear the official costume.
For Curnow's sake she changed to the
regulation suit and swam the final in it.
Her popularity with the Australian
sporting public is immense for they ad-
mire her physical power, her swimming
wizardry, her ability to overcome handi-
caps like the back injury which restricted
her Tokyo Games’ preparation, and they
often envy her her lack of sham. But
for years this popularity did not stop
you swimming officials from indulging in
the old Australian habit of white-anting
a celebrity.
The sheer lack of mercy in the penalty
you have imposed is incredible to any-
one who has been out to Balmain to
see where Fraser started. You hear it is
squalid but it still shocks you when you
see the house and the environment. She
did well to rise above it.
Not a high price
TpRASER’s father was a Scot, a ship-
wright who worked in dockland, and
for much of her early life his daughter
suffered from chest complaints. She did
well to beat that, too.
For years you men who run Austra-
lian swimming told sportswriters this or
that girl would soon whip Fraser. Watch
this girl from Kingaroy, Robyn Thorn,
you said, she’ll put Fraser in her place.
It was as if you wanted to prove there
was no place for individualism in topline
sport, and yet it is one trait common to
most champions. One by one Fraser
beat the girls you hoped would humili-
ate her, until finally the only way to stop
her was to suspend her.
Unfortunately, in your eagerness to
deal with Fraser you brought in three
other swimmers. I suppose the fact that
you have ruined their swimming careers
is not a high price to pay for finally
getting Fraser in your sights and gun-
ning her down.
Having announced the four suspen-
sions, you neglected to list any of the
charges against any of the four girls.
This set the scene for some pretty foul
rumors to spread which were far worse
than the original complaints against the
girls. Why you did not play it square
and announce you could not reveal the
charges because of the danger of legal
action, is a puzzle.
If we may speculate then on the real
charges against Fraser —most sports-
writers seem to be aware of them—were
her offences bad enough to justify a 10-
year suspension? Is failing to wear the
official costume in all her swims such
a crime? Is taking part in the Tokyo
Games’ opening ceremony against the
instructions of the swimming team
manager Bill Slade such a heinous
offence? Why, even the Tokyo police
captain who arrested Fraser after the
romp in the palace grounds ended up
presenting her with the flag she had
sought with the best wishes of his force.
The witch hunt
Tan Andrew, the girl alleged to have
collected the fourpenny one from
Dawn in Rome, turned up to help Fraser
launch her book. Fraser paid for that
Rome misdemeanor when she was
dropped from the Australian team that
visited Japan and South Africa in 1961.
I have heard officials say that Fraser
upset the training routine of our swim-
ming teams at Townsville and other
places she went to to get ready for her big
events. She knew what she had to do to
get into the best possible shape and if
this did not conform with what the offi-
cial team coaches had in mind, it cer-
tainly proved successful. If there was
any lack of discipline at the pre-Olympic
training centres, the officials in charge of
them were to blame.
I agree that some penalty is needed,
but in view of Fraser’s wonderful record
a 10-year sentence is out of all propor-
tion to the offences. It only makes sense
when you couple it with the background
of officials staging a long witch hunt
against Fraser. No wonder the women
swimmers’ chaperone in Tokyo, Anne
Hatton, said she was bewildered by the
punishments handed out.
American journals, notably “Time
Magazine”, blame publication of Fraser’s
book “Gold Medal Girl” for her long
suspension. “Time” calls the book an
aquatic “Peyton Place” and says it should
be renamed “Below the Surface”. Th§
fact is, however, that the report of swim
team manager Bill Slade, on which the
Australian Swimming Union acted in
suspending Fraser, was written before
publication of the book.
“Mag-bloody-nificent”
¥ have no doubt that material in the
book and the manner in which it was
serialised by some afternoon papers did
a lot to persuade any delegates to the
ASU meeting who may have been
swerving Fraser’s way that they should
accept Slade’s recommendations.
The book is typical of Fraser, irre-
pressible and deserving of the remarkable
success it is now having. It has been
serialised in the London “Sunday Mir-
ror”, who paid £2500 (Aust.) for three
articles from it, by the “Asahi Weekly”
in Japan, the New York “Daily Mirror”,
the Chicago “Tribune” and by papers in
France, Italy, Mexico, Germany and
Spain.
Harry Gordon, the Melbourne journa-
list who collaborated in producing it
with Fraser, says he was aware two years
ago that the ASU were out to “get”
Fraser. Nobody was out to “get” the
other three girls, though, and their

parents are understandably determined
to have their daughters vindicated.
Linda McGill says the charges against
her —she had it in a letter from you
gentlemen—were that she tried to take
part in the opening day ceremony and
that she refused to wear the official cos-
tume. The severity of McGill’s four-
year suspension becomes apparent when
it is realised she did not succeed in get-
ting into the opening day march. She
was put off the team bus which took the
marchers to the Olympic stadium.
Jn any case, there is no logic at all in
refusing robust girls like McGill and
Fraser the opportunity of taking part in
the opening day march. The official
excuse that standing in the sun and
marching tires them for their events is
absurd. Leaving them out certainly
allows more officials to get into the
march, but it does not improve the girls’
medal prospects in the slightest.
The charges against Dayman and
Duncan are secret but even if we accept
the most outrageous rumors there is
again a complete lack of charity in the
ASU’s punishments. After all, both these
girls are in their teens, both have worked
hard to reach Olympic standard. The
way things are they have been knocked
out of swimming for good at a time when
we can ill-afford to neglect any talented
young swimmer.
The report of the general manager of
the Australian Olympic team to Tokyo,
Len Curnow, is eagerly awaited. He
thought so much of Fraser’s effort in
Tokyo he gave her the signal honor of
carrying Australia’s flag into the closing
ceremony and all his public statements
were full of praise for her magnificent
achievement in becoming the first swim-
mer ever to win a title at three succes-
sive Olympics.
Asked for her reaction to carrying
Australia’s flag into the stadium, Fraser
replied typically: “Mag-bloody-nificent.”
Even before Curnow’s report is pub-
lished, the ASU would win back a lot of
the public support it has lost if it reduced
the punishments. Two years for Fraser
—which would give her a chance to get
into the next Olympics at Mexico City
if she wanted to make the effort —and
six months each for the other three girls
would get across the message that the
ASU expects a higher standard of be-
havior from its team members overseas.
Indeed if the suspensions were scrubbed
altogether, that message would already
have been well and truly underlined.
Think again, gentlemen, is a 10-year
banishment adequate reward for 40-odd
world’s records and three Olympic gold
medals?

Anyone Here from Ballarat?
What distinguishes man from the beasts
By BATMAN
Jack Cato, the distinguished photo-
grapher, once wrote of the Ballarat
boys. He said that with their super-
charged vitality born of their Antarctic
winters, they soon climbed to the top in
Melbourne. And he said: “Cry ‘Any-
one here from Ballarat?’ into the door-
way of a prosperous business, and you
will, more than likely, be led to the
manager’s office. But you must
approach the Presence reverently. For
they believe that coming from Ballarat
is what distinguishes man from the
beasts -’’
Indeed in the Town Hall outside the
Town Clerk’s Office there is a marvel-
lous old scroll, drawn up to celebrate
the 1852-1892 anniversary. It reads:
“BALLARAT, Forty Years from an
uninhabited wilderness during which
time it has become the grandest inland
city of the Southern World . . . Stands
unrivalled by that of any city in Her
Britannic Majesty’s extensive domain
over which the sun never sets.”
At this stage you had best be warned
that I have very strong prejudice in
favor of Ballarat. My forebears over
several generations were Ballarat sons,
and I go right along with the aforesaid
sentiments.
Unquestionably Ballarat is the most
beautiful provincial city in Australia.
The only possible challenger would be
Toowoomba in Queensland, but Too-
woornba falls down with the dreary
ugliness in the city area of Ruthven
Street. And Toowoomba doesn’t have
such statues.
Max Beerbohm, if I remember cor-
rectly, once suggested a society for
covering London’s statues. The society
would move out one night and cover
all the city’s incredible, regrettable
statues with tarpaulins, as a service to
the community. But I wouldn’t do that
in Ballarat, the statues add to the rather
perfect over-all picture. And it’s just
possible that in Ballarat there are more
statues than anywhere else in Her Bri-
tannic Majesty’s extensive domain.
The reason is obvious. In the hearty
golden days the wealth of Ballarat was
enormous and the finest way to be
remembered forever was to endow sta-
tues. In the superb Botanic Gardens
there is everything from Hebe to Leda
and the Swan (no kin to Sidney
Nolan’s). In a marvellous rotunda
there is a classic collection of Ruth,
Susannah, Rebekah, the Flight From
Pompeii and Modesty,
Modesty looks down sweetly through
a ve i] G f ma rble rieht beside the
“Right from Pompeii” For Modesty’s
sake one is glad to note one piece of
marble cloth just covers the Pompeii
gentleman’s more important dimensions,
Also in the Gardens there is a fine
avenue of busts of all the Australian
Prime Ministers. Well, nearly all.
Somehow they overlooked the brief
reign of Frank Forde, but he is ex-
pected to join the ranks shortly. The
avenue starts off correctly with Edmund
Barton, Alfred Deakin, J. C. Watson
and George Reid.
Sadly though, it has been the custom

Who discovered SINGAPORE?
We did! The travel agent started it by explaining it wouldn’t cost a penny
more to stop-over in Singapore, on our way to Europe. On those terms who
would miss the chance to go on a voyage of discovery!
So we came to Singapore. The friendly, cosmopolitan people welcomed us
to their fascinating country and we were set fair to uncover an array of
spectacle and excitement that gave real meaning to the saying—‘You see
more of the Orient in Singapore.’ Take a glimpse at this magical island
with us and you too will be taking the first steps towards discovering wonder-
ful Singapore.
SIGHTSEEING —Why see the world when
there's Singapore? See the rest of the world by all means —
but don’t miss Singapore! Where else do three great races present the
many faces of their culture, their pageantry and their costume and their
customs. Only on this fabulous Island can you see the Festival of lights—
The Mooncake Festival —The Chinese New Year celebrations —The Thaipusam
devotions and the Malay pageant of Hari Raya Puasa. Only in Singapore
can you, in one day, visit the Muslim Mosques—the Indian and the Chinese
temples —the Tiger Balm Gardens and the House of Jade.
Even whilst you are marvelling at this many splendoured spectacle, you
thread your way through a tapestry of costume and colour that excites your
eyes as only Singapore can.

Hughes, Chifley and George Reid have
all lost their heads.
The other good statue area is Sturt
Street the begging-their-pardon —St
Kilda Road of Ballarat, the splendid
sweep with its flower beds of petunias,
poppies and whatever, its oak trees, its
band rotundas and statues. Everybody
and everything is there; a good statue
of Peter Lalor in his Speakers robes,
a horrid martial statue of George V, a
formidable towering Queen Victoria, a
WCTU bird bath, appropriately bone
dry, a Burke and Wills monument
(although those gentlemen never passed
through Ballarat) and a South African
War memorial.
Thomas Moore the Irish poet is there,
and inevitably a dewy-eyed, almost
cuddly innocent statue of a youth,
Robbie Burns. The Irish put up their
poet, the Scots counter-attacked with
theirs and naturally the English wanted
to be in it, too, but it took longer. The
first fund-raising campaign for Shake-
speare was in 1889 but the bard statue
by Andor Meszaros, and quite the best
in town, did not go up until 1960.
Gloriously unchanged
As I say, Fm prejudiced in favor of
Ballarat. It is gloriously unchanged.
New buildings like fat insurance houses
and glossy banks are mercifully few.
I love the old Ballarat railway station
with its tower which looks as if it were
pinched in its entirety from an Atlanta
churchyard.
I love, too, the old verandahs. In
quality some of them can match the
best in New Orleans. Right now they
are all under sentence of death. Duti-
fully following the lead of half the other
councils in Victoria, Ballarat gave the
order under By-Law No. 148 that pillar-
supported verandahs had to go. The
National Trust, the Historical Society
and other bodies girded up their loins
and attacked.
The city’s young Mayor, Cr John
Chisholm, is sympathetic and now it’s
a blue chip certainty that the best of
the verandahs will be retained. As the
local National Trust put it, “In some
cases the iron employed in the decora-
tion of these buildings was smelted by
our own families at Lai Lai between
1858 and 1905.” The best of them are
the Old Colonist Club, the Alexandria
Tea Rooms, Reids Coffee Palace, the
Golden Point Hotel, the George Hotel
and Craig’s. Ted Crimmins, president
of the Historical Society, says that back
in the old days all the bands that came
to Ballarat for the South Street compe-
tition used to practise out on these
balconies. The noise in the evening
was something tremendous. Now most

One of aluminium’s many benefits is its
extremely high conductivity of heat. That’s
why it has been used in this giant 8-inch
diameter heat exchanger designed by War-
burton Franki. Its 22 fins provide a large
surface area, and thus permit rapid heat
dissipation through natural convection and
radiation. Used with semi-conductor
diodes in power rectifier equipment, it
eliminates the need for motor-driven
cooling fans.
The die for this complex extrusion was
designed and made by Australuco’s
engineers. Basically, extruding is like
squeezing toothpaste from a tube...except
for factors like pressure (58 tons p.s.i.),
tolerances (fractional variations mean the
difference between success and failure),
and rigidity (the bending or buckling of
cooling metal must be avoided).
That’s why there’s more to achievement
in aluminium than the metal itself.
Achievement also means Australuco’s years
of experience in extruding (over 7,000
different dies), research, testing, design,
metallurgical improvements . . . years of
practical application which can be summed
up in two words: know-how. So, when
you add technical skill and expertise to
aluminium’s inherent qualities (lightness,
strength, heat conductivity, corrosion resis-
tance), achievement is the natural result.
Australuco’s engineers and technicians,
backed by the world-wide experience and
knowledge of the Alcan Group, are able to
supply the latest information about the
many applications of aluminium in all
phases of Australian industry.

of them do their practising before they
arrive and, anyway, they stay at motels.
The most beautiful building of all is
the George Hotel. The National Trust
believes it has the best three-tiered bal-
cony in Australia. The George dates from
the 1850 s and, inside, the dining-room
has a gorgeous old ceiling. But the
atmosphere has been somewhat ruined
with too much chrome, plastic and var-
nished brick. Craig’s, though, is the
hotel in Ballarat.
Craig’s was the first licensed hotel in
Ballarat and the original building was
put up in 1853. Then there's the
famous story about Walter Craig and
the Melbourne Cup. Some months
before the Melbourne Cup Craig had a
dream that a horse carrying his violet
colors would win the Cup, but the
jockey would wear a crepe armband.
The year was 1870 and Craig was the
owner of the Cup chance Nimblefoot.
Craig told the story next morning to
some friends and that night he died.
Well, Nimblefoot won the Cup and the
jockey did wear a black armband, for
Craig. Around Ballarat many people
are apt to dismiss the story as a dear,
old legend. Yet Maurice Cavanough
and Meurig Davies, who wrote the book
“Cup Day”, did much research into this.
They discovered that the story of
Craig's dream was in the Melbourne
“Age” on November 9, 1870, the day
before the Cup, and there’s an 1870
painting in the VRC committee room
which proves that Nimblefoot's jockey,
J. Day, did wear a black armband.
It's one of Australia’s best stories but
there’s no space here to run on about
the history of Ballarat. From 1853
roughly 643 tons of gold were taken out
of the area. The peak population from
1856, say, to 1859 was 60,000. In
1870, when no Victorian politician dared
to move without first thinking of Bal-
larat, the population was 40,000 with
56 churches, three town halls, 10,000
dwellings, 84 miles of made roads and
477 hotels. But this was the first great
depression year. The bottom fell out
of the mining industry and the drop in
the value of Ballarat mining shares was
equal to half of all the revenue of the
Government of Victoria. Mines closed
down, hundreds were ruined. In the
late 1870 s the City Council was still so
broke it didn't light up the Town Hall
clock and many of the city’s gas lamps
went unlit.
In 1870 the citizens saved their city
with a native toughness and ingenuity.
They set to work to create new indus-
tries like the Phoenix Foundry which
built railway locomotives and the
Sunnyside Woollen Mills.
No gold worth looking at has come
out of Ballarat since 1918 but the story
is the same now as it was then, the
bid to save the Golden City image by
picking up more and more industry.
And there have always been looks
across the shoulder at that upstart of
a city, Geelong. Once Ballarat was the
residential home of the Prime Minister,
Mr Deakin, but Geelong was just a
has-been port. But between the world
wars Geelong made unbelievable pro-
gress. It gathered the mighty Ford
works and, from then, it became a first-
class industrial centre with a population
of 96,510.
Not merely suburbia
A ccording to the last census Ballarat
had a population of 54,913 with
85,000 within 25 miles.
So now the old city is irretrievably
behind Geelong, but the citizens like
to talk of Ballarat's solidity, its de-
pendability and how even now the big
retail stores can set better figures than
their counterparts in Geelong. After
all, they say, Geelong is really only
suburban Melbourne and people like to
go to Bourke Street for their shopping.
Whereas many a fine grazier from the
Western District still goes to Ballarat to
be outfitted.
Mr Edgar Bartrop, a real estate man
who has done much to attract new
industry to Ballarat, says: “No we’re not
riding a fat boom here, but we’re doing
all right, we’re picking up population
and going ahead. We’ve got variety,
that's one thing. If we were hurt by
the failure of any one industry we could
ride the punch.”
Industry is one thing, but the big
dream in Ballarat is to make the city a
great centre for culture, education and
the tourist. To the casual observer the
climate may seem somewhat in oppo-
sition. Come winter time with the
occasional snow flurry and Antarctic
winds blowing down Sturt Street the
old gold town seems to be the coldest
place this side of Mawson.
The best time is autumn, when the
days are sunny and mellow. This is
the time of Begonia Festival, maybe
the heartiest provincial festival outside
Toowoomba’s Carnival of Flowers. For

1965 the dates were February 26 to
March 8. It’s pretty much like most
festivals, there’s the inevitable float
parade, the inevitable mannequin
parades, the extremely inevitable march-
ing girls, the usual car rally, Music for
the People in the Gardens, an ingenious
show by Lake Wendouree called “Music
Across the Waters”, but above all and
everything, there are the begonias.
As the Queen herself is said to have
remarked, elsewhere begonias grow the
size of saucers, but in Ballarat they are
as big as dinner plates.
They have a gorgeous, almost lumi-
nous quality. Tom Beaumont, the
curator of the Botanic Gardens, says
there are over 100 varieties and he is
on first name terms with all of them.
Even Mr Bolte has said that the
Begonia Festival attracts more people
than Moomba, but there’s just one small
tragedy in all this. The crowds come
from Melbourne by the thousand, but
Ballarat is only 70 miles away. This
means a comfortable day tour with a
picnic on the shores of Lake Wendouree.
Worst of all they bring their own
lunches and they mightn’t even buy an
ice cream in Ballarat. It costs nothing
to look at a begonia.
Ballarat badly needs something else
to make it a year-round tourist centre.
But there are drawbacks to this idea.
There is practically no night life. There
is only one good restaurant, an adjunct
to a motel.
Restaurateurs always suffer in a
town where 75 per cent of the citizens
go home to lunch.
The obvious lure, of course, is gold.
But what are you to do when there
hasn’t been a working mine in Ballarat
for 47 years? You can hunt the town
and there's practically no evidence of
the gold era. At Eureka there is no-
thing to see, just a hideous bluestone
monument put up in 1886. One could
imagine what would have happened had
Ballarat been in North Carolina. There
would have been waxworks, museums,
dioramas, films, taped accounts of the
battle and if there had been no stock-
ade, by heavens they would have made
one.
Barry McOrist, local representative of
the Victorian Government Tourist
Bureau, is all for bringing back gold
fever. He wants the city to set aside
a special area as a park. There would
be an official prospecting guide who
would not only teach them how to pan
for gold, but also hire out the gear,
picks, shovels and dishes. Mr McOrist
would also like to see a mining shaft,
as authentic as possible, a place where
the tourist could get their boots mud-
died. There’s still much gold to be had
all around Ballarat in non-commercial
quantities. Geoff Coulson, the Ballarat

weights and measures inspector, and a
keen amateur prospector, says that gold
seeking is making a gentle comeback.
Many a professional man comes up
in his Jaguar to go panning in the near-
by streams. It’s a new method for
soothing Collins Street ulcers.
It would be very unfair to say that
Ballarat is not interested in history. The
local Historical Society is remarkably
keen and it has gathered a vast, if
somewhat disordered, collection at its
Barkly Street Museum. They have
everything from Lola Montez pro-
grammes and a gold battery to a photo-
graph of a very well polished and
extremely innocent Robert Gordon
Menzies at Humffray Street State
School.
The fearful long-drawn out battle on
the spelling of Ball-rat is still unre-
solved. Back last October the Victorian
Municipal Association at the request of
the Surveyor-General gave a firm ruling.
It would be Ballarat. Various enthusi-
asts can produce different historical
references. For example, the one A
enthusiasts say that the owner of the
first “land run” in the district, Archibald
Buchanan Yuille, spelt the name Balla-
rat back in 1838. But as far as the
city council is concerned the name is
officially Ballaarat, with the Gas Com-
pany it is Ballaarat, but on the other
hand the Railways, the Post Office and
most business houses go for Ballarat.
As for the Begonia Festival this is de-
finitely a two-A Ballaarat affair.
Again like Toowoomba Ballarat has
a reputation as an education centre.
There are good schools like Ballarat
College and Ballarat Grammar, St
Patrick's, Queen’s, PLC and Loreto.
Then there’s the famous old Ballarat
School of Mines, soon to get degree
status. And it’s interesting that despite
the fact that Ballarat is no longer a
mining town the School of Mines has
continued to specialise in mining and
metallurgy. Many of the best cadets
at BHP, Mt Isa and Whyalla still come
from the School of Mines.
Yes, Ballarat is very keen on its
image of culture. The public library
has a magnificent Australiana collection,
the sort of thing that would be the envy
of students in other cities. Then the
art gallery is a nice change from most
country galleries, the rubbish is obvi-
ously well out of sight. Apart from
noteworthy Conders, McCubbins,
Streetons and Tom Roberts the show
goes through to the Blackmans, the
Dobells. the ~ Dickersons and the
Lawrence Daws.
Mr W. Richie, secretary to the trus-
tees, says that they are just in the pro-
cess of launching a £40,000 gallery
appeal.
Part of the plan is to feature a Lind-
say room, donated by Mary Lindsay,
from the old family house at Creswick.
Creswick is only 10 miles out and the
city, keenly claims Norman and his
famous brothers as Ballarat sons. The
room will be fiJlcd with Lindsay furni-
ture and next door will be the Lindsay
gallery with prints and paintings by
members of the family. It should be-
come the greatest hotbed of Lindsiana
in the country.
As you drive around Lake Wendouree
spare a glance for the enchanting mid-
Victorian kiosk with its decorative
awning and long thin columns. The
kiosk is guarded by four cannons
labelled VR 1845 with the message
“Lent by the Defence Department to
the Ballarat City Council.”
Let us hope that with all the dangers
of the present military situation that
Mr Bolte’s Government does not ask
for their return.


OVERSEAS
Ceylon - a Neutralist
Defeat
But pro-Western victory yet to come
By EMERY BARCS
The victory of Ceylon’s United
National Party (UNP) at the Par-
liamentary elections last week was
the first success chalked up for some
time by a clearly pro-Western political
force in the neutralist camp. Whether
this welcome example will be catching
in that small number of uncommitted
nations w'here the right of genuinely
free choice makes an anti-Red swing
still possible, depends a good deal on
UNP leader Dudley Senanayake’s ability
to cure his country’s abounding political
and economic ills.
Clearly there is not much that the
Free World can do in helping Mr Sena-
nayake to solve his country’s political
problems such as the rift between the
Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minor-
ity. As the elections did not give either
the UNP or its major competitor, Mrs
Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s Sri Lanka
Freedom Party (SLFP), an absolute
majority the Tamil Federal Party’s sup-
port seems to be essential for forming a
coalition Government. Hence parlia-
mentary arithmetic may now give the
Tamils what they want —equality of their
language in Tamil areas and a measure
of local autonomy —and Ceylon what it
needs: a stable Government bent on a
sound economic policy free from dema-
gogic, ultra-Leftist ideological humbug.
But if the settlement of internal politi-
cal problems must be entirely left to
Ceylon's pro-Western politicians (and it
would be wdse not even to try to inter-
fere with them) the Free World must step
up massive economic aid to bolster the
Senanayake regime. For without this
kind of support the UNP victory will be-
come merely a passing incident in the
Asian struggle between democracy and
totalitarianism. Peking has intelligently
evaluated the importance of the econo-
mic factor in this struggle. Its political
interference has been discreet in recent
years but its aid has been substantial and
of the right kind. Red China’s aid to
Ceylon has included £2 million w'orth
of textiles (given at a moment when the
country needed them because of import
restrictions), £500,000 w'orth of textile
machines and large amounts of rice.
“The Chinese gesture,” said Dr N. M.
Perera, Ceylon’s Communist Finance
Minister, in his last budget speech, “shows
a sympathetic understanding of the pro-
blems of developing countries, and I am
sure before long their example will be
emulated by others.”
Pro-Communist propaganda was quick
to point out the difference between
Peking’s “understanding” and the US
decision to cut off economic aid (about
£2 million a year) in retaliation for the
nationalisation without compensation of
American oil companies.
Ceylon’s main economic problem
(which the island shares with many other
developing countries) is the steady widen-
ing of the so-called “agrarian scissors”
in recent years. The price of Ceylon’s
main export commodities—rubber, tea,
and copra—has been steadily shrinking
on the world markets while the price of
industrial goods which she must import
have increased. The determination of
the Bandaranaike regime to maintain,
and even to augment, the living standards
by maintaining “essential” imports has led
to the dangerous depletion of the coun-
try’s overseas reserves, to a sharp de-
crease in investments and to growing
unemployment. Last year Ceylon was
even unable to maintain the ratio be-
tween copulation increase and economic
expansion and per capita real product
decreased by 0.8 per cent.
An additional and very serious pro-
blem is the chronic shortage of locally
produced food. Ceylon only produces
half the food it needs, the rest must be
imported. The Bandaranaike regime,
however, introduced a programme which
provided everybody with cheap rice. The
Government pays local farmers 1.5 times
the world-market price for home-grown
rice as well as the world-price for im-
ported rice. Yet rice in Ceylon is sold
at half of the world-market price. This
subsidy alone has cost the Government
about £4O million a year. No demo-
cratically elected Government would sur-
vive if the rice-subsidy were substantially
lowered and the price of rice was in-
creased. It is also difficult to see how
the other expenses—caused by the Ban-
daranaike regime setting up a social wel-
fare State without the slightest regard
for the country’s economic capabilities—
could be cut. Mr Senanayake’s support-
ers would quickly desert him if he tried
to cure Ceylon's economic ills with dras-
tic austerity programmes.
Mr Senanayake fought the elections
on the thesis that the only hope for the
Ceylonese in a better future lay in their
opting for democracy. Many Ceylon-
ese have done so and now Mr Sena-
nayake will have to prove that his thesis
was right. Providing such a proof will
necessitate some sort of Ceylonese
Wirtschaftswunclor for which the UNP
leader will need the full support of the
resources of the Free World. This may
be costly. But there is no alternative if
Ceylon is to become a successful test
case for the West.


Defending Camp Kannack
Memories of a French disaster
From ARTHUR J. DOMMEN in Vietnam
6ifTpi HIS reminds me exactly of what
1 I was making reports on 15 years
ago,” said the French officer look-
ing down at the field telephone left be-
hind by the Vietcong force that had
disappeared hours before to the east into
the sombre green mountains. The offi-
cer was Lieutenant-Colonel Philippe
d’Adhemar, a former intelligence officer
and now French military attache in
South Vietnam. The implication of the
field telephone was obvious to him: the
Vietcong battalion engaged in the attack
the previous morning had co-ordinated
the actions of its company-sized units
with the aid of a communications system
as sophisticated as that employed by the
South Vietnamese Army.
The post under attack, Camp Kan-
nack, 10 miles north, was defended only
by mountaineer troops formed into four
companies of Civilian Irregular Defence
Groups (CIDG): one company each of
the Hre, Bahnar, Rhade and Mnong
minority tribes who inhabit the Vietna-
mese highlands. They were under the
leadership of a small cadre of American
Special Forces. The five-hour-long
Vietcong attack had failed, and the
assailants had left behind them 100
bodies, many trapped in the barbed wire
entanglements. They were busily cutting
through these with clippers and banga-
lore torpedoes when they were mown
down by the murderous automatic wea-
pons fire directed at them from sand-
bagged bunkers by the desperate defend-
ers of the compound, no larger than a
football field, in the midst of hundreds
of square miles of hostile jungle. “I
think they fought well because most of
them had their families with them,” one
of the Americans present during the
attack said of the hardy mountaineers.
At the height of the fighting, just before
daybreak, many women were in the sand-
bagged entrenchments helping to brjng
fresh ammunition to the guns manned
by their husbands.
The Vietnamese Army corps com-
mander. Brigadier-General Nguyen Huu
Co, impressed by the resistance, flew to
Camp Kannack to decorate the company
commanders and the one American cap-
tain and nine enlisted men who had led
it.
There was another indication besides
the field telephone that the character
of the war, at least in this upland region,
is'changing from the now familiar guer-
rilla hit-and-run type of war to a more
conventional pattern of large-unit ac-
tions. The latter fall into the type
General Vo Nguyen Giap, the North
Vietnamese Defence Minister, has called
“mobile warfare”.
Neat rows of Soviet-bloc rifles and
sub-machine-guns captured from the at-
tackers were lined up for visitors to
inspect. They indicate to intelligence
sources here that Vietcong units in this
region have for the past few months
been in the process of converting their
weapons system. Where they once de-
pended on home-made weapons and
captured American stocks, they now are
being fitted out with imported arms.
The changeover reveals a high degree of
confidence on the part of forces who
henceforth must depend on an elaborate
logistical relay system that originates
hundreds of miles away over jungles and
mountains; Taken together, the new
family of weapons now in the hands of
the Vietcong represent the weapons with
which the Soviet Union re-equipped her
armed forces in the mid-19505. As
such, they have never been put to the
test in actual battle, unlike earlier Viet-
cong arsenals and which came from
stocks left over from the Korean War or
the French Indo-China War. Intelli-
gence sources believe the captured wea-
pons are actually manufactured in China
on the basis of patterns furnished by the
Soviet Union. They in turn are handed
over to regular North Vietnamese troops
or South Vietnamese trained for infiltra-
tion purposes who then carry them by
hand into the South.
Since most of the supplies of food and
other basic necessities for Pleiku are
brought in by road, the Vietcong move-
ments in the region during the past
month give the strong impression that
a move is afoot to interrupt the flow of
traffic along Road 19 and isolate the
highlands from the sea. Such a situa-
tion might compel the Government to
evacuate its forces from the highlands
and surrender a vast area with sparse
population but immense strategic signi-
ficance to the Vietcong, who would pre-
sumably then be free to establish a
“liberated area” there in the orthodox
manner followed by Giap and the Viet-
minh in northern Tonkin. Whatever the
long-term meaning of the influx of
Northerners into the region and their re-
equipment with Soviet-bloc weapons,
Government officials are confident they
have foiled an attempt by the Vietcong
to inflict a humiliating series of defeats
in and around Road 19. Mindful of the
disaster that befell the French Mobile
Group 100 that set out from this town
exactly 11 years ago, and was ambushed
by the Vietminh before it got half-way
to Pleiku, the Government is maintain-
ing as much flexibility of action as it
can with the forces at its disposal.
‘‘lf this had happened in the French
days,” said the colonel who is senior
American adviser to the Vietnamese
Army’s II Corps at Camp Kannack,
“this camp would have been overrun
long ago. It’s a thorn in the enemy’s
side.” It is possible that American
supremacy in the air and the extraordi-
nary measure of flexibility retained until
now by Government forces, despite ter-
rorist actions against their most secure
compounds, may prove decisive in avoid-
ing a repetition of the French experience
here, (ofns)
Sukarno’s
Heir
A pres moi , le PKI?
By WILLIAM MCLAUGHLIN
How does Indonesia’s drift to Com-
munist China affect her own
future? The problem is not
acute as long as Sukarno remains in
power. Rumors of a possible resignation
have been circulating ever since it was
announced that he was ill, but it seems
unlikely that he would ever relinquish
the Presidency. Nor could he be forced
to, except by a coup d’etat. According
to the constitution, there is no method
of impeaching or removing the Presi-
dent or of calling him to account for
any of his actions. However, while
Sukarno is President for life, that life
is growing increasingly short. He is 63,
in poor health, and addicted to a pace
of living that would wear out a man
half his age. The reckoning may not be
far off. The tale of what will occur the
moment after Sukarno’s death has as-
sumed almost legendary proportions.
In the classic version, the 400,000-man
Army and almost three million-strong
PKI are eyeball-to-eyeball in a sort of
Oriental High Noon.
It could happen this way; there are
many reasons for believing that it will.
But if it does, civil war is the likeliest
outcome. D. N. Aidit, the young (he is
only 41) and undisputed leader of the
world's largest non-ruling Communist
Party, is far from stupid. The PKI is
certainly Indonesia’s strongest political
party, but it is strong only on the island
of Java. It cannot count on outside
support, thus it is likely that Aidit will
not risk a showdown until the PKI is
able to stand alone in Sumatra and the
Celebes as it is on Java. The Army is
in a similar situation. The leadership

Is far from united and it Is not possible
to say to what extent the lower echelons
have been infiltrated by the PKI. Most
officers, who have become accustomed
to performing civil as well as military
functions during Indonesia’s recurrent
crises, are fond of politics. There are
anti-Communist Army colonels—backed
by religious leaders—outside Java who
have revolted in the past against Sukarno
and who presumably would be no slower
to reject his successor.
The result would either be civil war
or the end of Indonesia. If anti-
Communist areas did break away, it is
not unlikely that they would seek the
support of Malaysia. This prospect,
however faint, must have already caused
some nightmares in Djakarta. These are
merely speculations on the worst that
could happen to Indonesia—civil war or
disintegration. But the vision of what
might happen if he prematurely hurled
the PKI into action may be enough to
make Aidit move carefully, at least at
the beginning. History says that a dic-
tator is usually followed by a weak man
presiding over confusion. The PKI
would settle for just that. Their choice
is rumored to be Foreign Minister
Subandrio, for it is believed that he
would carry on Sukarno’s policies while
giving the PKI time to build up its or-
ganisation outside Java in preparation
for the great day. According to a recent
“Christian Science Monitor” article,
“there is little secret about the fact that
he (Subandrio) wants to be President of
Indonesia . . Subandrio is, certainly,
one of the likeliest candidates.
In between Subandrio and the moder-
ates is the shadow area of those leaders
identified with the small but influential
Murba (Proletarian) Party, Adam Malik
and Chaerul Saleh. Both Malik and
Saleh have been conspiring in recent
months to weaken the PKI by urging,
through their own “Body for the Pro-
tection of Sukarnoism”, the amalgama-
tion of all political parties. Their rivalry
with the PKI has doubtlessly endeared
them to the anti-Communist core of the
Army, led by General Nasution. If
Saleh (or Malik) could count on some
Moslem support, the Army might pos-
sibly choose him as its candidate. From
the Western point of view the happiest
choice would be either Dr Hatta or
the Sultan of Jogjakarta. Both are un-
questionably non-Communist and have
extensive experience in public office.
Hatta has been both Premier and Vice-
President and is still immensely popular
throughout Indonesia, despite a semi-
retirement which began seven years ago
as a protest to Sukarno’s policies.
One of the most interesting aspects to
the Indonesian power struggle is the
PKl’s dilemma. Since it cannot risk
open combat with South-East Asia’s lar-
gest Army, it must continue the present
strategy of promoting a Peking-Djakarta
axis while identifying itself as totally
as possible with the Government—look-
ing forward to the day when, since there
is no difference between the Government
and the PKI, why not let the latter run
the show? But, as Ruth McVey has
pointed out, the PKI itself cannot be
sure where the people would stand in
the confusion of a Government-PKI
conflict, nor can it be sure that its policy
of identification will not become a
dangerous liability if there is a revolu-
tionary outburst against the regime. This
is always a possibility, given Indonesia's
political and economic chaos. Indonesia
is not an Asian Cuba yet. Even Dr
Sukarno, who is supposed to be blind to
the PKl’s machinations, refused to heed
Aidit’s recent and less than subtle de-
mand that the peasants be armed. Too
many of them belong to the PKl's peasant
league for Sukarno's comfort. Much,
if not everything, depends on how long
Sukarno or his successor continues the
reckless and demoralising campaign
against Malaysia. For the only thing
which is likely to be crushed is Indone-
sian aspirations for a stable and truly
independent government.


Selma,
Alabama
“We like our Nigras ”
From GAVIN YOUNG
>
As I sit in the lobby of Selma’s prin-
cipal hotel I can hear faintly the
voices of Civil Rights marchers.
They are beginning thqir all-night vigil
and are chanting “Ain’t no one going to
turn me round.” Selma is quiet outside
the area around Browns Chapel, the red-
brick, turreted 'structure where the
marchers are massed in a Negro housing
estate. “This has always been a quiet
little town, no kind of trouble,” said a
comfortable - looking Selma citizen.
There’s nothing very special about Selma.
It is not large: its population is about
3500 (60 per cent Negro) and it is con-
tained within a radius of three miles
from the city centre. It has neat tree-
lined streets and a fair-sized shopping
centre. It is the country seat of Dallas
County, and Dallas County Court House,
where Negro voters have sought to
register and Civil Rights marchers have
finally succeeded in demonstrating, is a
modernish green blockhouse in the city
centre.
But Selma, named years ago by a
former US Vice-President addicted to
the poems of Ossian (a legendary Gae-
lic poet), is clearly Southern. State
troopers in Alabama carry the red, white
and blue crossed flag of the old Confe-
deracy on their cars; no one forgets that
Alabama is the “Heart of Dixie”. The
timbered Albert Hotel lobby has posters
on its walls a hundred years old adver-
tising slave sales. One offers $2500 for
a runaway.
As it does throughout the State, white
opinion varies. Here in Selma, as else-
where, there is a hard core of tough, un-
thinking people whose own solution to
an alarming situation that is well above
their low level of tolerance is one of
naked violence. They are to be seen
most days here on street corners hiss-
ing obscenities and threatening violence
at anyone who looks like “an outsider”.
Three of their number attacked three
Boston ministers and the Rev. James
Reeb died. For them there is no com-
promise. For them the Nobel Prize
winner is “Martin Lucifer Coon” and
they hate and fear him. On the other
hand, many Selmans who have no
sympathy with the marchers have tried
but failed to understand what the Civil
Rights storm is about. “I just can’t under-
stand what the Nigras here want,” a
well-dressed saleswoman said to me.
“We like our Nigras. No Nigras wanted
to vote before Martin Luther King came
here. I am confused.” (ofns)
The “Third World’s”
New Leader?
Ben Bella’s cautious dynamism
From RUSSELL WARREN HOWE in Algiers
The postponed “second Bandung con-
ference”, now scheduled to open
here in June, will be nothing less
than President Ahmed Ben Bella’s bid
for the leadership of the “Third World”,
many competent Algerian and foreign
observers here believe. This would be an
extensive mass to lead: in Ben Bella’s
eyes, it means everyone not committed to
Washington, Moscow or Peking.
Is this ambitious dream merely des-
tined to raise his rating in Algeria? Most
ambassadors here think not: some point
to Ben Bella’s intransigence and apparent
contradictions as proof of his sincerity.
Here, they say, is an Arab leader running
a country depending mainly on Berbers
for administration, who is going to the
UN this year (if it meets) to put the
Arab case on “Palestine”, while rejecting
Islam as too narrow a banner for modern
Third World Unity, who is governing the
most Marxist government in Africa, the
one most critical of the US, from a city
where people now seem apathetic to
politics, where Americans appear to be
the most popular foreigners in town, and
where mechwi is eaten not to the mur-
mur of dialectics but to the blare of
Beatles, and the chirruping of girl stu-
dents changing an Elvis Presley disc for
an Aznavour.
Ben Bella’s pre-eminence among
Africa’s “progressive” states is already
real, despite his being white, and even
if the Third World, like any group, could
never be led from one of its wings. On
the Congo, his militant underdogman-
ship in favor of the “rebels” has made
him the most forward of the avant-
garde.
Only Cairo rivals Ben Bella in support
for the Congolese insurgents, and a top
aide here has boasted that “Nasser’s day
is over. He never fought a revolution. He
has nothing in common with Stanleyville
or Nkomo or the Angolans”.
Ben Bella is deeply,, radically com-
mitted. Twice a week, five Russian
transports resembling Cl3os lumber off
Boufarik airstrip and head for Khar-
toum with the French and American
surplus of the now Russian-equipped
Algerian army, plus Russian land-mines
and other semi-portable weapons. Some

of these 70 tons a week of military hard-
ware go to Sudanese Communists, mili-
ary experts believe, and some definite-
ly go to the Negro secession move-
ment in South Sudan; but most of
it is intended for the Sudanese
villagers fringing the Congo, whence,
it is hoped, there may one day be
a means of getting more than a trickle
into the Congo itself. At Boghari, resis-
tance fighters from Portuguese Africa,
Rhodesia, the Comoros, South Africa
and, reportedly, Morocco plus some
“legitimate” cadets from Kenya and else-
where, are getting infantry training.
Ben Bella’s dedication to violent revo-
lution and distaste for negotiated inde-
pendence is genuine. The late Frantz
Fanon, the West' Indian psychiatrist-
philosopher-martyr whose printed w'orks
are the conscience of the Algerian revo-
lution, saw violence not just as an obli-
gation imposed by repressive French
brutality but as a medicine for the “de-
colonisation of the spirit”. Ben Bella
similarly believes in the ideal of Caliban
detraumatised. The Rhodesian ultras and
South African fascists are, in Ben
Bella’s view, God’s gift to an Africa “ripe
for revolution”.
This js one of many ways in which
Ben Bella and the Chinese see eye to eye,
although Russian military aid and econo-
mic and technical influence is much
greater than probably anything China
currently dreams of doing. (A recent
cabinet meeting, however, criticised Rus-
sian aid as ineffective.)
Yet another apparent contradiction is
that Algeria is, and will presumably
remain, dependent on France far more
than on all the “progressive” countries
put together, while West German trade
credits exceed all Chinese aid.
France is prepared to pay generously—
currently, $250 million a year, plus oil,
wine, citrus and vegetable subsidies for
the maintenance of its commercial, tech-
nical, linguistic and cultural hold on the
country, and remains easily the No. 1
foreign power in all fields but ideology.
User and Used
T>en Bella’s Algerian critics are numer-
ous: they claim he fought an easy
war, first in exile, then in gaol; of the ori-
ginal “Club of 9”, he alone has survived
both physically and politically. Actually,
his war was not all that easy: his unfor-
tunate physical condition is presumed to
be the result of French police torture.
But there seems some truth in the
feeling that he is slow to appreciate mass
opinion; that he did not realise for years
that the country was Arab rather than
revolutionary (women’s status has not
advanced much); that grandiose foreign
affairs schemes interest him more than
unemployment and agriculture where,
the revolution notwithstanding, many big
Algerian landlords still own their vine
plantations, and their peons. Since April,
1964, Ben Bella has been at pains to
mention Islam and Arabism in his
speeches; his sudden discovery of the
“Palestine” question stems from this.
In the intra-Marxist cold war, in-
fluences tend to counterbalance each
other. Serge Michel, the erstwhile adviser
to Patrice Lumumba, edits the pro-
Peking “Ce Soir”. Pro-Russian Marxists
under Michel’s fellow-Frenchman Henri
Alleg still control “Alger Republicain”.
“Algerian” or “Titoist” Marxists hold
“Le Peuple”. But Ben Bella, who has
banned the Algerian Communist Party
and absorbed its members into his own
party, seems principally interested in
“using” the Communist powers to de-
feat residual colonialism, nothing more;
the Communists, of course, think they

are using Ben Bella to oust the West from
Africa. Ben Bella seeks the freedom
to be leader of the world’s great under-
developed majority, and appears to reject
direct control by his creditors.
His predominantly Berber rivals for
power have either been executed,
gaoled, exiled or neutralised, and only
two Kabyls—as Berbers are known in
northern Algeria—remain in the Cabinet.
He has come to terms with the Army
leader, Col Houari Boumedienne, the offi-
cial No. 2 of the regime, whose force
may soon reach 100,000 men —second in
Africa only to Egypt, if South Africa’s
para-military police are not counted in
the South African figure.
Diplomats here contend that Algeria’s
foreign policy ambitions can only be
understood as emanations of Ben Bella
himself —an earthy, direct politician
whose university was the Marxist section
of the Sante prison library. But time is
making its mark, and his much-criticised
radicalism is often tempered by shrewd
sense: he subsidises the work of Inter-
national Volunteers Service, an Ameri-
can aid programme, in the politically
sensitive Berber region of Tizi Ouzou; he
has evaded comment on Malaysia, on
Indonesia’s withdrawal from the UN, on
China’s plan for a rival organisation. His
most intransigent stand has been about
Kasavubu’s appointment of Moise
Tshombe, whom he sees as an imposed
figure.
x Extreme views
T>en Bella’s more extreme views are
often more evident in minor matters.
Facing the same African psychological
tragedy of childlessness as Sekou Toure
and Modibo Keita, he has puritanically
banned prostitution and stimulants (in-
cluding Algerian wine, which is for
Christians only) in a country where they
were the cakes and ale of the common
man. He has permitted the arbitrary
arrest of students who followed Bour-
guiba’s advice in not observing the Rama-
dan fast —which impairs productivity.
But the picture in Algeria is far from
wholly negative. The European popula-
tion is down from 1,100,000 to 80,000, a
sign of economic depression; the hun-
dreds of thousands of pieds-noirs have
only been replaced by their opposite ex-
treme, the cadaverous Communists from
Paris’ Left Bank; inflation has made
Algiers as dear as Dakar, and the oil
boom, as in Libya, only has about 15
years to run. But Algerians, after risking
death or Gestapo-like torture for nearly
eight years in the struggle for independ-
ence, have a pride in themselves that
resembles that of Londoners after sur-
viving the blitz; they seem friendlier,
more confident, than Moroccans or even
Tunisians. They work harder than most
underdeveloped peoples, especially the
Kabyl mandarin class; they have more
cadres.
Everywhere, there seem signs of hope.
Revolutionaries are often described as the
worst administrators in the world; but
there is an aura of optimism at all levels
in Algeria which a future generation may
justify, confounding the numerous critics
of this most radical of all Africa’s revo-
lutions.

Letters to the Editor
The Evidence of
Dan Jacobson
SlR.—May I protest against the travesty
of my views presented by Miss Leonie
Kramer in her discussion of my article
in the recent Commonwealth Literature
issue of the “New Statesman”? (8., Feb.
27). To rebut Miss Kramer in detail
would take up more of your space, and
more of my time, than either of us can
spare; and I can only hope that interested
readers will refer to my article and
their own conclusions from it. However,
I would be grateful if you would permit
me to offer just two small examples,
among many others, of Miss Kramer’s
extraordinary way of dealing with facts,
quotations and arguments.
(1) “Mr Jacobson is evidently not a
reader of poetry.” Thus Miss Kramer—
purporting to describe a fairly short
article which contains references to
“Shakespeare and the poets who were
his contemporaries”, to Shelley and to
Byron; which contains, as well, two
quotations from Wordsworth, one direct
and one indirect; and which opens with
an extract from T. S. Eliot’s prose and
closes with one from that of W. H.
Auden. “Evidently” Miss Kramer is a
most conscientious reader of the texts
in front of her.
(2) To show how patronising I am
towards Commonwealth writers, and
how sycophantic I am towards my
“metropolitan literary superiors”, she
writes as follows: “What hope is there
for us provincials? Some time in the
future, Mr Jacobson suggests, Common-
wealth writing may have an effect on ‘the
common language and its literature’.
Meantime we just go plodding on.” Now
what I actually wrote is this: “. . . there
is no reason why (the Commonwealth
writers’) achievements should not
ultimately have an effect on the common
language and its literature comparable
with that of the Americans.” The last
part of the sentence, so quietly dropped
by Miss Kramer, makes clear, I would
have thought, the magnitude of the
“effect” I hope for and points to the
standards I thought worthwhile invoking
in the discussion. (It also, incidentally,
makes nonsense of Miss Kramer’s re-
peated assertion that I have my eyes fixed
slavishly and exclusively on “English
literary fashions”.) Novelists of the
stature of Hawthorne, Melville, Twain
and James, historians like Parkman and
Prescott, poets like Eliot and Stevens,
have yet to emerge from the countries
of the Commonwealth. Miss Kramer
may find this fact unpalatable—she may
well be altogether unaware of it—but it
remains a fact nevertheless.
Once, among all her inaccuracies and
incomprehensions, Miss Kramer does
stumble upon the truth. That is when
she reveals, with scorn, that I am
“ambiguous” in mv attitudes. Indeed I
am. Only simple-minded people imagine
that it is possible to adopt simple
attitudes towards cultural and literary
problems of the greatest complexity.

The Pill
SIR. —As a Catholic couple with what
we suppose could be termed a large
family, we resent the constant innuendo
in journals like The Bulletin and in
cartoons like Tanner’s that this Pill of
which you (not we!) speak so often is
a matter of obsessional interest to us. We
resent the innbendo that this Pill will
in some way liberate us from what you
seem to think a burden thrust upon us
by our Church. We are grateful for
your solicitude, but we love our children,
we have chosen to have our children and
we thank God for the privilege of having
such children. We find this consistent
comment on our domestic affairs not
only distasteful but also irrelevant.

SIR. —As a Catholic layman and a
regular reader of your magazine, I
register my strongest disapproval of
“Tanner’s” cartoon (8., March 20). God
in His infinite goodness and wisdom has
endowed this artist with outstanding

draw such talent from those who are
impudent and ungrateful for favors
received. Have a care, Mr Tanner.

Dr Gough
SIR. —At the end of Patrick Tennison's
interesting exchange with Archbishop
Gough (8., March 20), His Grace said
that he was concerned that so much of
what was said in the Press about Church
affairs was incomplete. “For example,”
the Archbishop continued, “I confess I
was much disappointed with Peter Hast-
ings’ account in The Bulletin of his
recent interview with me. We had a
really interesting conversation. But in
my judgment he omitted to write of the
important things.” I made and kept
extensive notes of our conversation and
in my judgment, to use His Grace’s
phrase, they confirm my belief that I
included in my written interview all that
was significant. Some “important things”
which I did not include in the written
interview were, the A rc hbishop might
recall, excluded at His Grace’s request.

FORUM
The Case of
Comrade Mortimer
Communism and the Jews
By FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
One of the principal appeals of
Communism is due to the belief,
that, whatever their shortcomings
in other respects, Communist regimes are
totally impervious to racism and racial
discrimination. “Self - determination for
all nationalities including the right of
secession” is a doctrine seemingly em-
bedded in Soviet constitution, since the
inception of the USSR. As is usual in
Soviet affairs, the real political processes
are almost totally unrelated to the offici-
ally proclaimed, written principles, which
exist, more often than not, as a smoke-
screen to disguise the sordid transactions
which make up Soviet political reality.
Among Soviet minorities, three million
Jews occupy a special position which is
in most respects much more unfortunate
than the position of other minorities. The
official policy is forcible assimilation of
the Jews, who are, therefore, not allowed
to maintain their own cultural and poli-
tical institution. Yet, at the same time
successful assimilation of the Jews is
made impossible by a policy of discrimi-
nation and harassment directed against
individual Jews quite irrespective of their
level of assimilation. The Jew is thus
deprived of such instruments of com-
munal self-expression and self-defence—
however meagre and ineffectual—as are
available to other Soviet minorities, whilst
at the same time being treated as a
pariah. The word “Jew” is clearly
printed in his internal passport, and we
have it on Khrushchev's and Madame
Furtseva’s authority that Jews are not
regarded as “indigenous elements”.
Contrary to widely held beliefs, par-
ticularly on the political Right, the
Russian Jews, despite their depressed
position in Tsarist Russia, did not sup-
port the Bolsheviks in significant numbers
either before or during the Russian Revo-
lution of 1917. The allegiance of the
pauperised Yiddish-speaking masses was
evenly divided between Zionist political
groups and the Jewish Socialist Bund—an
anti-Communist social democratic body.
It was only during the Civil War, when
the White armies resorted to pogroms as
a means to detach the peasants from the
Red Army, that the Jews threw in their
fate, reluctantly, with the Bolsheviks, for
the simple reason that they had no other
choice. They were in a situation in many
ways analogous to that of the people of
Byelorussia and the Ukraine during the
Nazi invasion. The behavior of the
Germans was such that the hated Stalin
regime became in the end preferable.
It is true that the proportion
of Jews in the Bolshevik Party apparatus,
since its inception until the purges of
BULLETIN first raised the
A question of Soviet anti-Semi-
tism on September 29, 1962, when
Mr Isi Leibler described “the
rapidly deteriorating plight” of
Russia’s Jews. In sub sequent A ssues
there was an internationally unique
exchange of correspondence, in
which the Press Attache at the
USSR Embassy in Canberra, Mr
V. Gamazeichsikov, condemned
Mr Leibler’s claims as “cynical”,
“ignorant”, “dirty” and “impudent
lies”; in which the Communist Mr
Judah Waten claimed that the Rus-
sian newspapers quoted by Mr Lei-
bler were forgeries; in which
another Communist, Mr Paul Mor-
tier, accepted the evidence as
genuine but argued that it showed
“anti-religious” rather than “anti-
Jewish” sentiments; in which Mr
Samuel Rozin of the Novosti Press
Agency, Pushkin Square, Moscow,
quoted Moscow’s Chief Rabbi,
Yehuda Leib Levin, as saying:
“The Australian gentleman (Lei-
bler) has a very hazy idea on what
is going on here.” Since then Com-
munist Parties outside the USSR
have all been forced to accept as
true the evidence in THE BUL-
LETIN cited by Isi Leibler.
In this article Dr Knopfelmacher
discusses Isi Leibler’s book on the
subject, “Soviet Jewry and Human
Rights”, published in Melbourne
this week.
1934-39, was very considerably higher
than the proportion of Jews in the general
Soviet population. The reason for this
is fairly obvious and quite unconnected
with Judaism: the Bolshevik Party was
an overwhelmingly urban political orga-
nisation. Now, the inhabitants of some
of the principal urban centres particularly
in Byelorussia and in the Ukraine —
market towns in a sea of peasants—were
Jews, forming often up to 90 per cent
of the total population. Jewish “over-
representation” in the early stages of the
Bolshevik Party is a simple corollary of
this sociological fact. Jewish representa-
tion in the administrative apparatus of
State and Party was drastically reduced
in the ’thirties, and liquidated altogether
in the ’forties. At the present time, the
diplomatic, administrative and secret
police cadres of the USSR are almost
completely judenrein.
During and shortly after the Hitler
period Communist Parties managed to
attract many Jews, particularly in East-
ern Europe and in the USA, by the
simple device of pretending to be more
anti-Fascist than the others. The seem-
ingly militant (and fraudulent, as we now
know) anti-Fascism of the Stalin regime
contrasted favorably with the shilly-shal-
lying attitude of the Western democracies,
and gave rise to a powerful pro-Soviet
mythology among wide sections of the
Jewish population outside the USSR
which has, by now, been largely over-
come, ( though bits of it still linger on
here and there, particularly among people
around fifty. Much closer to the think-
ing of the younger generation is Mr Isi
Leibler, whose monograph (“Soviet
Jewry and Human Rights”, a Human
Rights Research Publication, 10s. 6d.) is
the most thoroughly documented, com-
prehensive and up-to-date publication on
Soviet Jewry. It gives a detailed account
of all relevant aspects of the question,
and it includes also a thorough analytical
study of the way in which Communist
parties outside the USSR have reacted to
the persecution of Jews under Stalin and
Khrushchev. The book contains a spe-
cial and thoroughly damning chapter on
the conduct of Australian Communists
and fellow-travellers in this matter.
Yet, what makes Leibler’s book an
event transcending in significance its
avowed topic is indicated in the editorial
preface initialled by Mr Newman
Rosenthal, a prominent member of the
Melbourne Jewish community. In it it
is revealed that following The Bulle-
tin’s Australian-wide distribution of the
anti-Semitic Kichbo cartoons which ap-
peared in the USSR last year, Mr Lei-
bler was approached by two members
of the Communist Party Central commit-
tee, Messrs Bernie Taft and Rex Morti-
mer (who is, also, editor of the “Guard-
ian” and co-editor of the Marxist quart-
erly “Arena”). After discussion with them
it was decided to prepare the book for
publication by “Arena”. In the end
“Arena” did not publish the book, but
Mr Mortimer wrote a personal letter to
Mr Leibler —published in full in the Pre-
face —in which he endorses the factual
content of the book as genuine and
recommends it to Marxists and people of


the Left everywhere. He also invites
Mr Leibler to write a shorter piece on
the same topic for “Arena”—which
could not handle the book as it stands
solely for the reason of its length.
Since Mortimer is not just anybody but
editor of one of the two principal Party
newspapers and an important member of
the Party Central Committee, it is quite
obvious that his action is a major act of
defiance. It is also obvious that he is
not alone and that the question of Soviet
Jewry per se cannot be the sole reason
why a veteran Communist functionary
who, as things are, had to connive at
moral outrages on many previous occa-
sions (e.g., during the Hungarian up-
rising) should now endorse a well-
documented attack on the Soviet Govern-
ment in an area in which the Communists
are particularly sensitive. Mortimer’s
action becomes intelligible if it is con-
sidered within the context of the present
sorry state of international Communism,
which is reflected inside the CPA.
No simple set-up
Tt is, by now, obvious to most compe-
tent observers that the machinery of
international Communism is in a state of
flux and disintegration. The issues on
which the future of Communism de-
pends can be summarised, roughly, in
this way: The Communist enterprise as
moulded by Stalin was a network based
on one great power, the USSR, which,
in turn, was completely under the thumb
of one dictator. The structure of Com-
munist organisations everywhere, as well
as the character of typical Communist
cadres, was entirely determined by this
fact. Yet Stalin’s simple set-up of one
network —one base—one boss no longer
exists. Many bosses, of which the Chi-
nese and the Soviet are merely the prin-
cipal ones, are now struggling for bits
and pieces of the network, from many
independent and semi-independent Com-
munist power-centres. Can a totalitarian
movement survive in which doctrinal and
political authority is multi-centric, each
centre claiming on its own behalf to be
the harbinger of historical necessity and
political truth? Can one totalitarian
mansion accommodate a bevy of quar-
relling messiahs? How will Stalin-
picked officials, selected originally for
their craven servility and lack of inde-
pendence, survive in a new Communist
world for which quite different qualities
are required, such as charismatic appeal,
Independent judgment, and the ability
to manoeuvre and to manipulate—often
entirely on one’s own?
The answer to all these questions
Is complex and unclear, though our
own survival as a nation may depend
on the outcome. Yet this much can
be said already: Communist Parties all
over the world are, at present, riddled
by complex faction fights. Wherever
A typical Soviet anti-Semitic cartoon
Moscow rules the roost, Peking has
a dissident “fraction” and vice versa.
And there are sub-splits inside each fac-
tion. It may take years before the pre-
sent upheaval inside the Communist bloc
will result in permanent institutional and
personnel changes. In the meantime be-
wildered and frightened functionaries,
brought up in the cruel but sheltered
world of Stalin, are doing their poor
best to contain a process which they
do not understand.
The formation of Hill’s Peking orient-
ed CPA (Marx-Leninist) is probably not
the end of the splitting process inside the
CPA. It is obvious that in it at least three
other groups are vying for power. There
is the old Stalinist leadership, represented
by Sharkey and Dixon, which is obvi-
ously on the way out —if only because of
its age. Then there are officials who wish
to modernise the Party, give it a new
and better image and a greater measure
of independence from the Russians on the
Italian model, but they do not envisage
any basic changes in Party structure and
doctrine. Yet there is a third group,
led by Rex Mortimer, which includes
some intelligent non-Party sympathisers
and ex-Communists. This later group is
frankly and openly revisionist. Their
object is to reorganise and de-dogmatise
the Party completely, and abandon, if
necessary, important Marxist - Leninist
principles. The focus of this group is
the Marxist quarterly “Arena”, launched
originally with the discreet backing of
the Party Central Committee, for the
purpose of restoring the influence of the
Party among intellectuals. For an out-
sider, not living in the artificial world of
the Party, the stuff contained in “Arena”
is obscure and verbose rubbish, bearing
all the marks of dishonest totalitarian
apologetics. Yet, to the connoisseur of
Communist mental processes “Arena”
spells trouble—for the Party apparatus.
One may shrug off as half-baked
nonsense what “Arena” has to say about
American sociological enquiries, yet the
fact that they are being taken seriously
and discussed coherently without the
usual swearwords indicates that the
closed world of the Party is cracking. An
enterprise started as a Trojan horse, to
invade cultural institutions has now
turned on its masters. The Party’s at-
tempt to win the intelligentsia has, in
fact, bounced back badly. And the fact
that “Arena” is a success—its seminars
are quite interesting and attract large
numbers of socially significant customers
—makes the situation only worse. What
is Mortimer up to? His choice of the
“Jewish ‘issue” for a showdown is, in
Party language, “no accident”. Anti-
Semitism has become the identifying
characteristic of the Stalinist Soviet
bureaucrat—the type, now past his fifties,
who grew up and was conditioned under
Stalin.
This “neanderthaler” type, entrenched
in the administrative apparatus of
State and Party, is narrow - minded,
conventional, authoritarian, anti-Semitic,
suspicious of “foreigners” and totally
opposed to liberalisation. The struggle
for liberalisation inside the USSR is
directed, overwhelmingly, against this
type. Ever since the publication of
Yevtushenko’s moving pro-Jewish poem
“Babi Yar” and Khrushchev’s attempt to
bully Yevtushenko for it, anti-anti-
Semitism has become the badge of the
Soviet anti-neanderthaler. Bearing wit-
ness against anti-Jewish discrimination is
the outward sign of a semi-underground
reform movement in Soviet society, its
“flag” as it were. It is only a part of a
more general syndrome, which includes
other “cosmopolitan” features such as
liking for jazz, modern art, non-Marxist
philosophy, and Western social and eco-
nomic theory. It is a Communist custom
of long standing that Soviet faction fights
and other political issues are re-enacted
in the Communist diaspora—often on a
comic and inappropriate scale. Hence,
those who wish to associate themselves
with Soviet “revisionists” will adopt their
issues. And this is precisely what Mor-
timer and his group seem to be doing.
They are carrying the struggle against the
Stalinist “oldsters” into the Australian
Communist Party.
Baiting the Neanderthalers
will be the outcome? The suc-
cessor-designate of Sharkey, Laurie
Aarons, seems to be playing along with
Mortimer at the moment. Undoubtedly
he will use the “Jewish” issue to bait the
neanderthalers and to convince his Soviet
contacts that a revision of the Party
along “Italian” lines has become inevit-
able. Yet, like Gomulka, in the past, he
may use the “liberals” to get his way with
the Russians and the neanderthalers, and
then drop them. Aarons wants a modern-
ised Communist Party, not one identi-
fied holus-bolus with extreme revision-
ism and with creeping social democracy.
His own political success in Australia de-
pends mainly on the future developments
inside the ALP —the Party’s principal
reservoir of “mass-influence”. Commun-
ist control over parts of the ALP is now
only “organisational” by way of pressure
from affiliated “unity-ticket” trade unions.

HEBE’S HOW AUSTRALIAN
ABRASIVES HELPED
TECNICAST INCREASE
PRODUCTIOH BY 150%
Tecnicast Pipes Pty. Ltd. are the largest manufacturers of cast
iron sewerage pipes in Victoria. They use abrasive wheels to cut
the pipes and, until recently, were cutting an average of 80 pipes
per wheel.
Then they received a visit from an Australian Abrasives Sales
Engineer. He proved to their satisfaction how an A.A. wheel
could considerably improve production, at no extra cost.
Today, using A.A. wheels exclusively, Tecnicast are cutting 200
pipes per wheel ... a remarkable increase of over 150% in
production. At no extra cost.
The technical knowledge and service offered by Australian
Abrasives to Tecnicast are available to you, too. If you have a
grinding or cutting-off problem in your plant ask for the free
advice of an A.A. Sales Engineer. It could save you money, too.

Aarons want is. a “unity of hearts”, that
is, a political and ideological rapproche-
ment between “the masses”, i.e., ALP
voters, and the CPA. Some ALP Left-
wingers want it too and have made
statements to this effect. If they
get their way, that is, if Senator
Kennelly and his friends are de-
feated, the foundations will be laid in
Australia for a united-front type mass
party in which a liberalised CPA will play
the tune. On the other hand, if the ALP
Right wing were to win, the ALP will be
closed to any form of co-operation with
Communists, who will face political iso-
lation. And in such periods of isolation
the “dogmatists” always get the upper
hand, which means in practice that Mor-
timer and his friends would be on the
skids.
An “Italian” Communist Party, lord-
ing it over a neutralist Left-wing ALP
would be much more dangerous for Aus-
tralia than an isolated sect of “dogmatic”
extremists. One, therefore, wishes Aarons’
venture to fail. Yet one also hopes that
the “revisionists” around “Arena” will
recognise the absurdity of their present
position, highlighted by their endorse-
ment of Leibler’s book. How can they
remain “friends of the Soviet Union” as
Mortimer claims in his letter, whilst at
the same time conceding the truth of the
enormities listed and painstakingly docu-
mented by Leibler, enormities which were
perpetrated by Stalin as well as by
Khrushchev? Is it really possible for a
country to be, as Mortimer says about the
USSR, a “contribution to the welfare and
progress of mankind” and be ruled, in
a totalitarian manner by murderers,
bullies and obscurantists? Surely, as
good Marxists they must ask themselves
the thoroughly Marxist question: “What
are the objective social conditions which
make such misrule possible?” An answer
worth considering is contained in the
writings and personal conduct of Milovan
Djilas.
All sorts of swindlers and cheats find

The Last Gold Rush
On the lip of the break of the Great Drought
By M. H. ELLIS
The town of Mt Morgan, surviving
by courtesy of a cataclysm which
had pushed a huge core of iron-
stone, gold, copper and pyrites up from
the bowels of the earth, was my home
town from the time I was nine until I
was nearly 17.
We lived in a £25 shanty on top of
a very high hill covered with large
boulders and commanding a magnificent
view of the mine. To obtain a resi-
dence in Mt Morgan, you merely
applied for a miner’s Right, took up a
miner’s homestead of one acre —there
was plenty of vacant land—got credit
from the local iron-and-timber mer-
chant, bought a few goats (if not adroit
enough to steal them), a few fowls
(ditto), made a billy goat cart and
settled down to happy domestic life until
the next storm removed you from the
landscape.
The programme of existence consisted
of getting up at five, milking the goats,
bringing water in kerosene tins from a
well a mile away when the tank ran
dry, walking four miles to school bare-
foot and four miles back, milking some
more goats, reading Dickens aloud,
doing your homework and going to bed.
The weekends, save for the domestic
tasks of getting wood for the week,
milking the goats, carrying the water
and going to Sunday school, were your
own. Mostly you spent spare time
either swimming or hunting for “allu-
vial” with cradle and dish.
During the great drought of 1902-3
we lived off gold off a blessed leader
which we found in a gully at the back
of our domain which, in the perverse
manner of gullies, had yielded not a fly-
speck until some amateurs like ourselves
began looking for the stuff in places
where science and geology and the laws
of gravity said that gold could not
possibly be.
Today, you can still see the place
where my father and I dug a little round
water hole, filled by endless trips by
night with kerosene tins slung across a
pony, from the Big Dam a mile or so
away. We worked in secrecy or with
shouts of despair to ward off the little
rush that would have deprived us if we
had admitted that we were —at long
intervals getting small slugs up to
half-a-pennyweight out of the unpromis-
ing place. For half the town was out of
work and rocking cradles. And you
needed only to show a glint in your eye
and every would-be fossicker in the
place some of them with real, genuine
miner’s Rights—were all roynd pegging
out “fifty-by-fifties”, and like as not
working your ground illicitly after dark.
Indeed, starting rushes and threaten-
ing to start rushes became an industry.
You could, of course, under the law peg
a claim anywhere if you had a Right.
is the third in the series
of M. H. Ellis’s reminis-
cences. The first two appeared
in THE BULLETIN , Janu-
ary 9 and February 13.
When “rush faking” the best people
to pick on were a butcher or a grocer
in the main street. After one or two had
had experience, they were very pleased
to submit to blackmail of regular rations
to prevent you from committing perjury
and starting a rush in their yards by pro-
claiming that you had just found the
three or four grain specks you had
pinched five years before right by the
back verandah this minute. For if the
poor tradesmen did not submit at once,
he would soon find his premises a quarry
and his double bed sinking into a costeen.
Today this couldn’t happen. All the
countryside is tied up by big companies
which clear you off with an injunction
if you so much as cast a purposeful
towards it. /
There was, however, one big rush in
those days and I find it a thing to
remember because I wrote my first
printed newspaper article about it as a
fifteen-year-old, in that influential journal
the “Brisbane Grammar School Maga-
zine”. There were never any more rashes
as large in Queensland. It happened this
way.
November, 1903, was a dreadful
month of heat, thunderstorms and
meteors on the lip of the break of the
Great Drought. The humidity was
nothing, the nights of moonlight were
as clear as crystal. One particularly
furnace-fierce afternoon when the sun
was going down in blood over the mine,
my father and I were trying to persuade
a large brown snake out of a hole under
one of our gate posts with the aid of
some Milesian profanity and a light


crowbar. Suddenly, we saw a mounted
cavalcade wending its way up Spring
Street (so called because even mountain
goats had to spring from rock to rock
when negotiating it). It was headed by
one Peter Fehrin. Everything about the
party had a furtive air.
Presently, travelling fast, came a few
scattered human pairs and singles all
with the same appearance of going no-
where in particular.
We were about to abandon our snake,
when a friend of my father’s came
nimbly up Spring Street, carrying a pick
in one hand, a dish slung on Lis back and
a sugar bag in his left hand. He took
my father aside and in the conversation
I picked out the word “59 ounces”.
It now appeared that Mr Fehrin had
camped in sight of a deserted mine called
Struck Oil seven miles up the Dee River.
Within a few yards of a crossing used by
hundreds every year, he had put down a
hole to get some water and had struck
neither oil nor water, but £236 worth of
solid gold in one lump.
It was only 18 inches down on top
of a hard, thick limestone bar where
no alluvial gold could possibly be found.
But he and his selected friends were
now off to join the character who was
watching over their prospective wealth
with an ugly black Winchester .44 for
company.
My father did not know much about
fossicking, but his Irish imagination
assured him at once that he was a made
man. His friend went off hot-and-light-
foot to peg out a claim for us. Me, you
could not have kept at home chained to a
log. '
Our old pony who had expected to
spend a quiet night was soon loaded with
two chaff bags, thrown across her ill-
nourished back and full of picks, dishes,
dismantled cradle, rations, blankets,
ammunition, gelignite and detonators.
The moonlight was brilliant and I
remember that the hooters at the mine
blew to call up the 11.30 shift about the
time we saw ahead of us, on a one-man
path between close bush and sheer cliff,
what appeared to be a waiking woodheap
making loud jangling noises as it moved.
It seemed about five feet high and six
feet wide. On its back was slung a
miner’s dish. Over its head it had the
body of a cradle through the snout of
which it peered as through the open
vizor of an immense helmet, as it turned
round to give us a malevolent glance.
Among other impedimenta it had a swag,
a large black billycan, a coil of fine wire,
a necklace of jam tins and a few other
useful bits and pieces. It was moving
with the snail-like rhythm of an accus-
tomed bush load-carrier. And it was
sadly impeding our progress.
“Here,” yelled my father (not a
patient man), “move over, will ye? We’re
in a hurry.”
The obstruction turned itself slowly
round and proclaimed its Welsh origin.
“Moof oafer, iss it?” he asked in the
accents of Aberystwyth, “yes, I will moof
oafer, whateffer. I hwill moof oafer and
smack t’ bletty noasse off yu, I will moof
yu oafer cliff, I will.”
After so friendly an introduction it
was natural that within ten minutes we
should have teamed up together, the
experience of a veteran whc had been
on Gympie in 1868, the Palmer in 1872
and sundry other gold rushes since,
could not be ignored.
"Presently, enfolded in an atmosphere
A of amity, we arrived in Peter’s
Rush, to be warned off various ap-
proaches with poked rifle barrels and
growls, dog and human, but early
enough in history to achieve a dere-
lict shed for an habitation and a
claim not more than 200 yards
from the reward claims, which formed
“the deepest bit of ground round here”.
Our Welsh companion having un-
loaded his goods into a tidy heap pro-
ceeded to fortify our camp with his jam
tins by hanging them in front of the
shed.
“D'tinss,” said the voice of experience,
“D’tinss iss t’ hang on t’ pegss, for if
yu do not hang d’tinss on t’ pegss,
t’ bletty jumperss will jump yu, they
will. An dey hwill steal, so dey hwill.
Dey hwill steal eferyt'ing. Yess, in t’
bletty tark!”
The morning revealed Mr Fehrin’s
guard watching his gold with two Win-
chesters. But there was very little else
to be seen except a little campfire smoke.
However, shortly just after the thin
notes of the seven-thirty hooter reached
us, a cloud of dust began to rise in the
west and it was plain that the news of
what was afoot in Struck Oil had
reached Mt Morgan town. Many coming
off shift had not waited to go home and
tell mother. They had grabbed anything
that would cut a peg and started run-
ning. And about nine o’clock in blistering
morning heat they began to arrive in real
force cart, goat team, horse, bullock,
on foot.
That night, silence had departed from
Struck Oil. For a mile or so around,
the bush and thick brush had been
pegged out in little fifty-foot squares. A
loud babel of voices, strange in that
place, rose from round five hundred
camp fires. But the human stream was
still pushing in.
Next day came the Gold Warden, a
little man in gold-rimmed spectacles,
J. C. Linedale, who when challenged by
an irate claim-jumper to fight with any
weapons he liked, exclaimed succinctly:
“Axes.”
Hard on his heels came the Erfn
Holm Hotel on a bullock wagon squired
by its prospective licensee, Mr Heiser.
And then the hawkers, the traders, the
confidence men, and the riff-raff and the
sightseers rolled in. Very few women
came.
Soon nothing else was needed to
make a gold rush perfect save for one
thing: gold, of which not a solitary
speck had turned up after the first dis-
covery—the cynics now said that must
have come out of a robbed bank.
But the afternoon they next struck it
rich was something to see. A small
crowd was grouped round the costeen.
The cradle was rocked and watered.
Pieces of red earth were picked out and
broken open —they were mostly cinna-
bar, it seemed. If the nugget that came
out was a mere few shillings’ worth it
was tossed into the crowd; if it was more
it was tossed into a butter box.
Nuggets were passed round through
the crowd with a lordly lack of pre-
caution. All the new chums were dis-
appointed. The gold was all a dirty
brown and in a few days it became so
common that only the owners seemed to
trouble to look at it. At the peak, there
were 300 Q men on the field.
The Narine claim of which we were
the owners achieved no wealth for the
owners. From under a tree root a few
yards from our boundary and almost on
the surface, however, a neophyte named
Billy Large dug out the biggest slug of
the Rush—the 180 ounce Lady North-
cote nugget found in June, 1904.
But neither I nor any youth with hard,
mountain feet went away empty of fun
or pelf from Peter’s and its sub-rushes.
Much of the gold at the rush was
embowered in a hard, yellow wash which
had to be broken up before it could be
cradled. This was achieved by the
hard-soled small boys who walked up
and down in troughs “breaking pug”
for claim-holders. I and other part-time
“pug-wallopers” made more money than
most claim-holders.
But that was all. Last time I saw
Struck Oil, fifty-nine years after the
rush, the bush had closed over its site
so thickly that I could not get to our
old claim.
Twenty years after I was in Thurs-
day Island when Hughie Hamilton, PM,
came back from closing the Batavia
River goldfield, where the local fos-
sickers, nearly all veterans, were going
mad and deaf with quinine, and shoot-
ing off guns at each other.
In moonlight as bright as that of
Capricorn, I heard from the verandah of
the Federal Hotel the pregnant words:
“Yess, dere iss golt on de Batafia, I
tell you sso dere is plentee off bletty
golt, look you . . .”


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
That Cat
Thelonious
Dig the long medulla
By ALBERT GOLDMAN
Thelonious Monk is a hard man to
place. When you mention Monk
to somebody who knows the jazz
scene, they always give you the same bit:
“He’s the guy who started Bop.” Well,
we all know that, but still you can’t dig
Monk as a Bopper —he’s too individual
for that tag. Then there are the cats
who go into a thing about “Monk, the
Genius of Jazz”, the man who plays and
writes and arranges, and does every-
thing the end. Well, I wouldn’t call
what he does playing the piano, and you
never hear those pieces of his played the
same way twice.
No, man, you gotta dig Thelonious as
the thinker, the skull, the long medulla.
Just watch how he sits there on* the
stand. He don’t hump over the keys like
them studs who just wanna rave on all
' night. Maybe he’s got one leg over the
other, sitting sidewise with his elbows on
the rack while he flaps the keys with
one hand. You dig right away the cat
is thinking. He don’t wanna play for
anybody, he just needs an audience so’s
he can be alone and work things out for
himself. Sometimes he gets so frustrated
trying to get something down, he just
gives up and lets the other boys rave on
without him. Sometimes he’s thinking
so hard, he don’t even bother to get a
sound.
Monk's solos are the craziest things
because every two bars he’s off on a new
idea. He’ll start in with some weird
little blip he just picked up from outer
space, and then, just when you’re sure
he’s gonna make it, he gives the dial
a twist and his rig starts bringing in the
funny old sound of some Harlem piano
player, circa 1925. Two bars of that
jazz and the set suddenly jams on an
African time-signal—one swinging note
struck over and over again until you're
ready to flip! You see now what it is
when a guy is always thinking—he can’t
get himself together so’s he can play.
Monk’s ideas are mostly things he
does with tonality and rhythm. He’ll set
his bass player going in one key, then
he’ll come on strong in another key. Or
maybe he’ll make two different rhythms
fight it out, drums against piano. That
left hand of his is always feeling around,
grabbing chords nobody else would think
to play. Every time he lays a strange
chord down, the music tilts to a different
angle. Sometimes he tilts it so sudden
and so sharp, like, the cat who’s taking
the solo comes tumbling down like a
bottle off an upturned table.
Monk’s right hand isn’t worth much.
He has a hard time playing what he hears
in his head. Compared to a great piano
man like Bud Powell, Monk sounds like
a cat who needs lessons. That's why
you always wanna catch Monk inside
a combo where he don’t have to do the
big solo bit.
The cats who play with Monk are the
most grooved men in America. He
keeps feeding them crazy ideas until
they’re out of their skulls. Sometimes
you’ll see him play something, and then
look up to see whether he reached the
other man. Monk’s always sending
messages like that and trying to turn the
other boys on. One night he got so far
out he even tried to turn the audience on.
He shuffled off the stand and started
yelling at the people to dance! Now,
there’s a scene for you —imagine all
those cool cats lobbed out in their seats
getting up and firking around to that
insane beat!
I guess what gasses musicians the most
about Monk is this —no matter how gone
he gets with his atonal jazz, he never
loses a strong racial sound. You see,
most of the modern cats are pretty well
hung up between jazz and the classical
stuff. They all took a little vacation up
at Juilliard after the war, and before
they got away they were hooked on Bach
and Debussy. Now, a man like Monk is
good for these cats. He’s like some old
oil well that keeps pumping up the good
black stuff when all the new rigs have
gone dry.
Even with some modern cat, who used
to play with Monk years ago, I guess
some of those rough chips must have
stuck in his brain, ’cause every so often
I hear a nutty sound in his playing, and
I say to myself, “Now, there’s a man
that digs Thelonious!”

Jazzman Gone
Polymath
By SAM LIPSKI
“They say 1 look like God,
Then God is black, my
God,
If both are made in the
image of thee
Could thou perchance a
. zebra be?”
44 ~I" WROTE l^at * n 1946 after a race
1 riot. In my musical, ‘The Real
Ambassadors’, Lambert, Hendricks
and Ross sing it alternating with Louis
Armstrong. They do a sort of Gre-
gorian Chant. Louis does the blues. I
could tell you so many sad stories about
that musical. You know my wife lola
and I worked on that show for five
years. And it’s only ever had one per-
formance, in Monterey at a jazz festival.
Five thousand people cheered it to the
echo. It has been recorded but never
had a run on Broadway.”
Why? “Because it dealt with a racial
theme. It didn’t go. But perhaps today
it could really go. Music can change
a whole nation. But it’s very hard to
tell at the time what effect you’re having.
You just can't tell at the time. It’s only
when you look back.”
Looking back on an interview with
Dave Brubeck is to see him from the
carpet up—black shoes, black socks,
black trousers, black tie, white mono-
grammed shirt,' and charcoal-grey hair,
Flopped in a chair he seems to be per-
petually tired, forever catching up with
days lost across uncountable international
date lines.
“What’s the time? It must be 2 a.m.
in the morning. Boy, did I have wild
dreams. Do they have horses going up
and down the street. here at night? No?
Clip, Clop. Clip, Clop. Boy, it was wild.
I lay there in that bed and couldn’t sleep.
So I read the papers at 5 o’clock in
the morning.” Brubeck is here for the
third time since 1960. That particular
morning he was reported as one of the
50 leading American performers and
artists who had boycotted South Africa.


To a radio interviewer he spoke of com-
mitment, involvement, and concern. He
explained his opposition to racial dis-
crimination and spoke of the fear he
held for his 17-year-old son who later
this year will go with other students to
Mississippi to work for integration.
Yet to hear him tell it, 45-year-old
Brubeck, living in his Westport, Connec-
ticut, home, is jazzman gone suburbia.
His six children go to riding lessons,
take piano lessons, drum lessons, flute
lessons and use their parents as chauf-
feurs to all of them. But, again, to hear
him tell it, Brubeck is as much jazzman
gone social reformer.
“Some businessmen are so chintzy.
That’s it, chintzy. They’d sell their
souls in the name of profit. What was
it that President Johnson said the other
day—‘What does it profit a man if he
doth lose his soul?’ That’s so right.
“And you know what? I don’t feel
I’m sacrificing anything when I don’t
sell mine. I once gave up earning 8000
dollars for 20 minutes’ work on a big
network show because they had a bad
racial policy.”
There is still, of course, Brubeck the
jazzman gone jazzman. “Shearing and
I—we’ll get together to play for one
another—it's just so great —when you’re
both being so honest. I'm always amazed
at his ear and he's always amazed at the
size of my hand. That really cracks me
up. You’re playing elevens, he’ll say.
Shearing is the best solo pianist in the
most overall command of the instrument.
Oscar is more the hard-swinging kind,
in the footsteps of Art Tatum. If I want
to laugh I play Garner. I don’t give a
damn what he's playing, even if it’s sad
I still laugh until my jaws ache. When
I hear Monk, I know I’m listening to
an innovator. That’s his big contribu-
tion.”
As for the way his concerts and
Monk’s concerts clashed, Brubeck
seemed genuinely disappointed and be-
wildered. “I just don't know how it
happened. No one wanted it to happen.
I hope Thelonius gets a good audience,
you know.”
The exciting things ahead for Brubeck
lie in the further exploration of his com-
plex time signatures and poly-rhythms,
getting them more complex and intri-
cate. He can lose himself, he says, in
poly-rhythms and poly-tones for the next
20 years. For now. he is working on
two screen scores, writing another ballet,
and planning an operetta with a racial
theme set in Britain in the 18th century.
With his composing, performing and
studying, what Brubeck wants to be it
seems is the jazzman gone polymath.
Brubeck himself may provide some
clues to where he is going in an opera
he is writing called “Malenctha”, based
on a story by Gertrude Stein. A jazz-
man is a jazzman is a jazzman? . . .
LONDON LETTER
Pablo the Demon Lover
By NIGEL DENNIS
The wages of sin used to be death.
OK, but what if the wages go up?
Obviously, some fate worse than
death must be provided—say, a best-sel-
ler in which one sinner spills the beans
about the other. Spilt with vim, a best-
seller makes hay of the grim reaper.
In “Life With Picasso” (just published
in London, by Nelson), Frangoise Gilot
has done a model job. In fact, she has
almost overdone her modelling by calling
a pen-pal in to help. He is an American
named Carlton Lake, and he is one of
those literary birds without whose skill
many a girl like Frangoise would never
manage to get her sin between hard
covers. Between Gilot and Lake, we get
to know Picasso. We even get to know
his chest-hairs. He was in a
glass darkly, but now, chest to
chest.
Of course, Pablo was a mug-
gins to team up with Frangoise
and start another illegitimate
family in his sixties. Age and
experience should have taught
him that the union could only
result in a best-seller. All
women insist on getting mar-
ried and the man who can’t or
won't ought to know he’s jump-
ing in Mr Lake. Just teaching
mistresses how to draw is not
enough. Those aren’t the lines
they’re after.
Frangoise was some 40 years
younger than her demon lover.
They walked round and round one an-
other in wary circles for a long time be-
fore Pablo suggested that they shack
down together. Francoise replied that she
ought to live with her old granny. To
which Pablo replied: “Your grandmother
needs you less than I do.”
There is no need to dwell on their
sex-relations here. These were just the
same as other people’s. This is because
sex is not a mark of genius. Any Tom,
Dick or Harry can do it. But to paint as
well as Pablo requires unusual concen-
tration. So that all that need be said here
about sex is that having made their bed,
Pablo and Frangoise often lay on it.
What a fascinating man to live with!
Lucky Frangoise! No wonder she says
in the last line of her book that she will
always be “grateful” to Pablo for having
taught her to find herself. Silly not to
stress it earlier, though. Readers who
don’t get to the very end of the book
may never realise that it is inspired by
gratitude. Mr Lake should have spotted
this.
Thanks to Pablo, Frangoise met all
the most famous people in the world
another thing any girl would be grateful
for. Pablo was also a wonderful
businessman and wouldn’t sell his paint-*
ings to art dealers unless they bought
Frangoise’s paintings as well. So Fran-
goise became a very well-known artist—
thanks to kind Pablo.
Frangoise was rather a bourgeoise
by bohemian standards and never really
took to most of Pablo’s habits. He wore
the same trousers until they fell off.
When he ordered a new suit, he ordered
four, and hung them in a cupboard until
the moths had eaten everything except
the tailor’s cotton thread.
He was very found of hats and used
to steal his son’s. As a precautionary
measure he kept millions of
francs in a locked trunk (so as
to “have the price of a package
of cigarettes”, he used to say).
He also had two rooms in a
bank vault, full of priceless
pictures by himself and his
friends. Being saved up for a
rainy day.
He liked Frangoise to walk
about in the nude because, as
he said in. his open way, he
didn't want to get ideas only
for reclining nudes. Once, she
was caught naked by a visiting
bullfighter. But Pablo pooh-
poohed the episode in his usual
sensible manner. “You weren’t
in any danger with him,” he
said sharply. “After all, you’re not a
bull.”
Of course, no book about Pablo would
be complete if it were stuffed with noth-
ing but silly gossip of this sort. Even the
most naked study of a painter must men-
tion his paint. So there is a good deal
here about Pablo’s working methods and
artistic views.
They are not to be relied on, unfor-
tunately, because instead of just being
stated in a general way they are put into
Pablo’s mouth and he is made to speak
them as if Frangoise had remembered
by heart whole pages hot from the horse’s
mouth. One is surprised that a profes-
sional man like Mr Lake reposed so
much faith in a woman’s memory.
The portrait that emerges is certainly
extremely lifelike and one feels very
envious Frangoise’s good luck in
having spent ten such fruitful years with
such an exceptional person. Two beauti-
ful children, a market for one's paint-
ings, a small place in the history of books
it is certainly something to be grate-
ful for.

THEATRE
Unrequited Love
The Seagull. Anton Chekhov. Independent
Theatre, Sydney.
A. Penny for a Song. John Whiting. New
Theatre, Sydney.
“The Seagull” is a play about unrequited
love. None of the lovers, who are so
generously proffering their love to the
wrong person, x;an respond to the de-
mands for love that are made upon
them. All are suffering and all are
pitiless to the other sufferers. But the
two who are destroyed are the young
and innocent Nina and Constantine.
Their youthful hope is casually crushed
by the selfish worldliness of their elders.
Nina is the seagull, image of natural
innocence, who is indifferently destroyed
by the unfeeling hunter. Of course,
since this is Chekhov, it is not so simple
as that: there are all sorts of checks and
balances. Trigorin is weak and selfish,
not strong and ruthless, and Nina is
attracted by the worldliness that destroys
her. She, in her turn, is pitiless to-
wards Constantine and scorns the poetic
vision that he expresses in his play. But,
nevertheless, the basic image in the play
is the image of the seagull and the hunter
and the basic conflict is between the
worldly actress and her lover, who re-
present the town, compromise and sel-
fishness, and the two young innocents,
who represent the country, idealism and
love.
Peter Summerton’s production, while
it contains some good performances and
some good scenes, seemed, on the first
night at any rate, to have failed to
grasp the underlying unity of the play.
The effect was of jerkiness, uncertainty
of atmosphere, and a general feeling
that each actor was performing on his
own without reference to the others.
Because Chekhov’s realism involves
the jerkiness and inconsequence of con-
versation and action in everyday life, it
is very important that the producer
should bring out the underlying unity
of the play. The basic conflict should
be established in the first scene. Chek-
hov prescribes an idyllic setting on a
summer night in the parklike grounds of
Sorin’s estate, with the moon rising
above the lake. This is Nina’s setting
and the scene of Constantine’s poetic
drama. The mood is destroyed by his
famous mother, the worldly actress
Madame Arcadina. But, instead of this
pastoral beauty, we have at the Inde-
pendent a stylised claustrophobic jungle
and a lot of distracting “business”. How-
ever. the production improves as it goes
on and may gain serenity as the six-
week season proceeds.
Doris Fitton captures Madame Arca-
dina’s regal histrionics, but she is more
coldly calculating than I would imagine
the character to be. Verity Marina, by
very skilful acting, portrays Nina’s in-
nocence and freshness, but she does not
succeed in showing the change to the
mature and embittered woman. Gustl
Korner gives a most distinguished per-
formance as old Serin. Barry Jenkins’
excellent Trigorin unfortunately loses
strength in the second half. By con-
trast, David Goddard's Constantine
gains authority, but he could be less
frenetic, more the poet and dreamer.
Chris Christensen as the worldly Dorn
and John Mordaunt as the self-effacing
schoolmaster both give good perform-
ances.
Beside the realism of Chekhov, “A
Penny for a Song” seems abstract and
“literary”. The characters are all
“characters” and the only really color-
ful figure is Sir Timothy Bellboys him-
self who plans to repel, singlehanded,
the invasion he hourly expects of
Napoleon and his 175,000 men.
Nevertheless it is an interesting play
and one of great sweetness, which is
well realised by John Tasker’s produc-
tion. The interest comes not from the
“poetic” utterance which marks the
speech of a number of the characters
but from the comedy of cross purposes.
The wider implications of this comedy
are much more profound than the sup-
posed profundities of the dialogue.
Alan Herbert is delightfully energetic
as the ingeniously eccentric Sir Timothy,
and Andree Browne and Bill James both
manage an unembarrassed naturalness in
the difficult parts of Dorcas Bellboys
and Edward Sterne.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
The Other Culture
The Tiger and the Horse. Robert Bolt. St
Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
Difference of Opinion. George Ross and
Campbell Singer. Comedy Theatre,
Melbourne.
By every rule in the book “The Tiger
and the Horse” should be a flop. It is
encrusted with sub-plots, its ideas are
nebulous and its situations contrived.
Enough, one would think, to ruin any
play, but oddly enough it emerges bet-
ter than many a well-tailored one. Fail-
ing the intellect, it somehow manages to
triumph with the emotions.
As a story of English university life, it
shares with Albee’s work a view of the
secret defeats and perversities (but not
perversions) of academics, and with C. P.
Snow an ill-defined morality. Jack Dean,
the master of a college, is about to
become vice-chancellor. He is one of
those detached, enclosed individuals, a
scientist, who claim to know themselves
but whom nobody else can really know.
In his case, certainly not Gwendoline,
his wife —herself a B.Sc. His apparent
invulnerability plays havoc with her de-
fences, undermines her nerve and nearly
pushes her over the brink.
One of their two daughters, Stella,
believes that she understands her father.
She is loved by a youthful research fel-
low, Louis Flax, who distributes petitions
against nuclear bombs, and through this
precipitates a crisis in Stella’s mum. In
London, Stella was played by Vanessa
Redgrave, which, because of her known
political involvements, gave this part in
the drama its particular bite. Louis
hardly knows what he wants, except to
get the girl into his bed, promptly to
make her pregnant. He is an Angry
Young Bungler.
This is not just a play about the con-
fusions of sex, the chasm dividing the
generations and all the wearisome pro-
blems that, linked with it, swirl across
our stages. It searches for the hidden
springs of insanity, personal and collec-
tive, in the rock of true and false love.
Throwing up clouds of incidental grit, it
demands from the audience a high de-
gree of empathetic participation, which
it gets after a while. There is a certain
poetry in all this prosiness, a fervor
which, for the eventual effect, depends
entirely on the intensity of the acting.
That it ever becomes intense enough,
with characters popping in and out like
white mice, is due to distinguished per-
formances by the two leading women.
Margaret Reid's Gwendoline starts off
by being irritatingly gauche, until it
breaks on us that this reflects her failing
reserves of self-denial. When they give
out we see a good woman whose wisdom
has turned to destructiveness. She is
acted very richly and with fine shadings.
Elspeth Ballantyne’s Stella, in her blend-
ing of guilelessness and teenage hysteria,
is not far behind. Anne Chesterton, as
her go-getting sister, -makes an accept-
able foil. Carl Bleazby copes with the
master’s part as well as the script allows,
but Jeffrev Hodsson is not happy in the
vice-chancellor’s role.
The joyful ending makes a nice change
but, while it is psychologically still
plausible, it is too pat because too many
loose ends have to be tied all at once.
Yet in its higgledy-piggledy fashion the
thing moves us. Bolt's generous vision
vanquishes his inept technique.
Vision is nothing and technique every-
thing in “Difference of Opinion”, a
first-rate thriller about business intrigues
in a construction firm. It seems to fol-
low old recipes but is, in fact, unusual:

DAVID MARTIN
FILMS
Tooth and Claw
Nothing But the Best. Director, Clive Don-
ner. Embassy Theatre, Sydney.
Goldfinger. Director, Guy Hamilton. Regent
Theatre, Sydney.
The Yellow Rolls-Royce. Director, Anthony
Asquith. St. James and Liberty Theatres,
Sydney.
Clive Donner’s satirical comedy of an
ambitious nobody’s tooth-and-claw rise
to the ranks of the Top People has a
witty cynicism rare in English films. The
theme is similar to that of “Room at the
Top”, but whereas Clayton’s film took
pains to point out the burden of shame
and guilt which Joe Lampton must bear
throughout his life, Donner watches the
connivings of his Jimmy Brewster with
detached, irreverent amusement.
Jimmy sets his sights high: partnership
in the firm in which he is an obscure
employee and marriage to the boss’s
daughter. He ruthlessly attains both,
aided by the tuition of an upper-class
deadbeat—a splendid performance by
Denholm Elliott as the sponging failure
who still cannot disguise his in-built con-
tempt for the man who is not the “real
thing”.
Alan Bates’s sharp-witted performance
shows Jimmy as a thoroughly reprehen-
sible but oddly likeable young predator,
with no virtues beyond plausible charm
and an admirable singleness of purpose.
Unlike Joe Lampton, Jimmy’s loftiest
emotions are only momentary fears that
he may be found out, an occasional un-
ease at the precariousness of his position.
Bates's acting and the flippant, lively
direction of Donner impose the film’s
inverted standards completely, so that at
the end the viewer genuinely wants
Jimmy to get away (literally) with mur-
der.
Technically the film js always efficient,
often astonishingly original. Donner, a
former editor who has worked chiefly in
television and made “The Caretaker”,
has managed the transition to a color
feature film with ease, but has retained
the swift cutting and laconic narration of
the small screen at its best. His use of
camera is a constant, delightful surprise
■—for instance the close shot of Jimmy
and his girl apparently in a smoky
nightclub which cuts to a long shot
showing the couple dancing to the music
of a car-radio in a misty Thameside
street. The use of color is the best I’ve
seen since “Four for Texas”.
A word of praise, too, for the musical
score of another TV graduate, Ron
Grainer, with its pseudo-reverent quotes
from the “Hallelujah Chorus” or
“Gaudeamus Igitur”, and its church
music themes for scenes in the bank.
James Bond continues his highly en-
tertaining career in “Goldfinger”, a film
which defies all critical standards except
the basic one of being enormous fun.
His new director Guy Hamilton, usually
workmanlike but rather stodgy, has en-
tered surprisingly well into the spirit of
the thing; indeed Bond's adventures are
becoming so outrageously improbable
that they would thrust frivolity on prac-
tically any director.
I’m afraid that dear James, engaging as
he is in the rugged person of Sean Con-
nery, is a bit of a boob. In “Goldfinger”,
despite the advantages of unlimited
money and a car equipped with such
safety devices as radar, tail-guns and a
passenger ejector seat, he spends his
time being trapped and ambushed, and
only foils Goldfinger's nefarious schemes
with the aid of Pussy Galore and a size-
able portion of the US Army.
Curiously, the film’s technical rough-
ness—careless back-projection, a crash-
ing plane on visible strings—only add to
its amiable amusing foolishness.
“The Yellow Rolls-Royce” is the big-
gest, fattest, most expensive nothing of
a film since “The VIPs”, with which it
shares producer-director Anthony As-
quith and scriptwriter Terence Rattigan,
who should both be put out to pasture,
to judge by their showing here.
The three stories are only linked by
the car which appears in each one and
has no other plot function except to
provide its current owners with a con-
venient back seat for clandestine love-
making.
The impressive cast makes little effort
to battle against the dated script and
direction, with the exception of Shirley
MacLaine, whose sensitive performance
in the middle sequence brings the film
momentarily to life. Rex Harrison and
Jeanne Moreau convey merely a well-
bred surprise that they’re involved in
such twaddle; Ingrid Bergman, poorly
made-up and abominably gowned, gives
a burlesque of her own burlesque per-
formance in “The Visit”.

Dixon’s Beethoven
Sydney Symphony Orchestra Concerts.
Concert by Dean Dixon. Town Hall,
Sydney.
Dean Dixon and the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra departed in some ways from
traditional Beethoven playing at the
Town Hall last Thursday. Dixon was
conducting, for the second time, this
year’s opening programme of the sub-
scription concert series - Beethoven’s
First and Ninth Symphonies. Soon after
the start of the adagio of the First Sym-
phony’s first movement, the impression
took hold that Beethoven was unusually
tame and restrained. The orchestra ap-
peared in high professional trim and re-
sponded readily to Dixon's deft gestures
which imparted more than the usual
Haydnesque elegance.
The andante in the second movement
was downright un-Teutonic and elegant.
The powerful, virile minuet bounced into
the audience, but again with restraint,
while the final cheerful and bright rondo
must have changed some of the concepts
of those who have become afraid of Beet-
hoven over the years.
Some must have wondered how this
kind of treatment would affect the monu-
mental Ninth. The wildly impelling,
sombre first theme soon showed that
tradition had returned: here was Beetho-
ven, serious and obsessed with the strug-
gles of mankind. The tranquillity which
came with the end of the second move-
ment and the noble expressiveness of
the third somehow seemed to set the
stage for the onslaught that would follow.
Tension appeared with every character-
istic flutter of Dixon’s hand and with
every shrug of his expressive shoulders.
Then the bass tones announced the con-
troversial “Ode to Joy” theme and the
great Ninth began to climb to its climax.
The four singers, Heather McMillan
(soprano), Florence Taylor (contralto),
Raymond McDonald (tenor) and Noel
Melvin (baritone), bravely fought their
ways through their parts which are so
thankless from a range point of view.
At times they stood there, a small
forlorn group, ungraciously drowned by
the massive sound volume hurled at them
from behind by the Hurlstone Choral
Society. The choir was wonderfully
groomed and showed great skill and dis-
cipline in the softer passages. The soloists
did a thoroughly competent job under the
difficulty of what some people would
call “impossible” parts.
Singing the parts in English seems in-
congruous and detracts from the massive
Beethoven canvas conjured up, but this is
undoubtedly a matter of prejudice, hard
to shake off.

BOOKS
Behind the American Face
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Nothing Personal. Richard Avedon and
James Baldwin. Penguin. £6 6s.
A cold elegance, sly charm, glitter: the
qualities Richard Avedon’s camera
flourishes are already famous. Magazines
galore, the musical “Funny Face” with
its Paris stripped of grubbiness: these
showcases for his skill displayed a man
capable of cleansing the world with a
Hollywood polish. Lately, he has shown
off a different flair; and “Nothing Per-
sonal”, a pictorial insult to America, dis-
plays a misanthropic and daemonic
charm one can’t help preferring to the
schmaltziness that preceded it.
“Nothing Personal”: the title’s rather
heavy irony introduces—as perhaps
everybody knows by now —a chamber of
horrors of the famous, interspersed with
a brimstone sermon by James Baldwin.
The white volume’s intent is
to take the spectator for a ride
through the pitted, dew-lapped,
haunted or desperate faces of
modern America. Above the
stiff silk shrouds, the animal
pelts, the gems and charm
bracelets and tight pumps,
American women —who seem
to excite Mr Avedon into par-
ticular fury—glitter brainlessly
or heartlessly. Perle Mesta, a
hostess with, splendidly, the
mostess on the ball, is—or so
one had would have thought—
a woman of considerable style
and sharpness, battling the years with a
defiance that appeals. Instead, she ap-
pears here as a proud vulture, shoots of
hair on her chin, eyes sad and cold,
mouth a savage gash in a putty face. In
a fine panel stretching across two pages,
the Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion cluster formidably, shrewd, vulpine,
tough. But some of them still express—•
despite Mr Avedon's efforts —humor,
courage and charm. And if Billy Gra-
ham’s mouth is, or is made to be, silkily
predatory, his eyes still have a sparkle and
liveliness Mr Avedon could not expunge.
Some of the pictures are introduced
rather awkwardly into the book’s pattern.
One can’t really see the point of the
photograph of Fabian, large eyes glowing
vacuously, mouth parted in narcissistic
pleasure, hands in the cuff-fixing expect-
ant position of a tailor's assistant waiting
for trade. Good as the picture is, it’s
only an inch away from a fan magazine
cover. And Mr Avedon again falters
with the pointless “shock” close-up of
Allan Ginsberg, naked at that famous
gathering when, like the woman in Isaac
Rosenfeld's celebrated short story
“George”, he ostentatiously stripped to
the buff. But ample compensation can
be found in the pictures of Governor
Wallace, coldly proud and contemptuous,
and Dwight Eisenhower, drained and
arid, an exact visual equivalent of his
harangues.
I have met only one of the victims of
Mr Avedon's lenses: Dorothy Parker.
She came into the living-room—of a
white-painted Hollywood bungalow she
was sharing with her long-estranged
husband, Alan Campbell—carrying a
poodle, and somehow, without dropping
the beast, managed to extend both hands
to me in greeting. Small, very Jewish in
appearance, deceptively genteel, she
dropped on to a sofa and drank hard
liquor out of milk glasses for five and a
half hours until — a minor domestic crisis
cropping up—she called me a
taxi. During that time, she
talked about murder cases;
loyally, she seemed anxious to
keep throwing the conversa-
tional ball in Alan Campbell’s
lap (a former Broadway
matinee idol, he had written
with her the script of the
original “A Star is Born”). I
can recall someone saying that,
before he murdered his wife,
Hawley Crippen had done the
whole house out in pink and
had been feeding the lady
sexual depressants. Dorothy
Parker. Just think, I’ve been living all
these years with a chemist. Alan Camp-
bell: Pink. It must have been like living
inside a lung.
And the face: it wasn't easy to forget
the face. Sharp, kind, witty, amazingly
young (she was born in the last century)
it was still recognisably that of the girl
who had dazzled the Algonquin. I can-
not forgive Mr Avedon for seizing on the
truth about her present life —Campbell
a suicide, she returned in 1963 to New
York for what a correspondent of mine
has called “a long unproductive period
. . . you can see the results in a terrible
kind of bitterness”. It shocks me to see
the face now, lips drawn back from the
teeth in a grimace of pain, and I think
Mr Avedon should have had respect for
her grief, and left her alone.
The book’s text, savagely anti-Ameri-
can, shows Mr Baldwin in an often un-
happy light. But hysterical and arrogant
though it is, the writing still carries the
power of a considerable talent. And a
deal of truth, as well, whatever the critics
may have said: I can vouch for the icy
veracity of his portrait of New York.
Alternately piercing and blunt, Mr
Baldwin’s diatribe echoes the visual un-
evenness of this maddening, between-
several-stools, irresistible and eminently
buyable book.
Africa’s Dark Past
The Outlanders. Robert Crisp. Peter Davies.
38s. 6d.
Rule of Fear. Peter Becker. Longmans.
38s. 6d.
From recent events in South Africa it
would be possible to draw the wry con-
clusion that Britain lost the Boer War
after all. Boer Afrikaner, Cape Colonist
and Outlander seem to have been welded
into a community that owes something to
each of them, but most of all, in the
major issue of apartheid, to the heritage
of Oom Paul Kruger rather than any
other strand in the fabric of nationality.
Robert Crisp’s book is specifically a
chronicle of Johannesburg, perhaps the
most astonishing boom town ever known,
but it is also the story of the transforma-
tion of South Africa’s destiny when the
gold mines of the Rand began yielding
up their riches. It is a lively and well-
documented narrative, and it contains a
particularly good account of the Jameson
Raid and the remarkably devious in-
trigues in London, Capetown and the
Transvaal that finally goaded the Boer
Republic into war.
In 1885 the high veldt was the home
of a few thousand Boer farmers whose
fathers had trekked across the Vaal River
with their waggons, oxen, muskets and
Bibles to escape from the British rule of
Capetown. In the wilderness they esta-
blished a simple, self-reliant way of life—■
patriarchal, harshly puritan and anachro-
nistic. Then one day a wandering pros-
pector kicked a glittering fragment of
quartz out of the ground on the Ridge
of White Waters—the Witwatersrand.
Twelve years later the Rand mines were
pouring out £10,000,000 worth of gold
a year, and 150,000 greedy, energetic
European “Outlanders” had swamped the
old farming community of the veldt.
On the heels of the pioneer Outland-
ers came the financiers—the visionary
Cecil Rhodes, shrewd little Alfred Beit
and bouncing Barney Barnato—for much
capital was needed to exploit the deep
reefs of the Rand. To the weight of
Outlander numbers they added the
weight of Outlander money. Stubborn
old President Kruger might perhaps have
held at bay the noisy agitators of Johan-
nesburg, but his tight little Boer oligar-
chy was no match for the Imperial ambi-
tions of Rhodes and Joseph Chamberlain.
It was one thing to deny the franchise to
the cosmopolitan crowd on the Rand; it

was another to challenge the City of
London and the British Government.
It was taken for granted in England
that the Rand rebels yearned for the pro-
tection of the Union Jack. In fact, as
Crisp convincingly shows, they had no
particular desire to see the Transvaal
turned into a British colony. A repub-
lic run from Outlander Johannesburg
instead of from Boer Pretoria would have
suited them very well. Few of them
shared the romantic Cape-to-Cairo
notions of Rhodes and Jameson. They
were simply interested in exploiting the
gold mines and making money. What-
ever charges may be brought against the
Outlanders, they did not launch the Boer
War.
Peter Becker’s “Rule of Fear”, a bio-
graphy of the redhanded Zulu monarch
Dingane, goes back to an earlier era in
South African history. Dingane succeed-
ed in 1828 to the despotism founded by
his murdered brother, Chaka, and, in the
next 10 years established Zulu rule over
most of present-day Natal. He was a
gross monster who left a trail of blood
and destruction wherever his armies
marched. For 50 years after his death
the decimated native tribes were help-
less to stem the tide of white invasion.
Dingane was the first Zulu king with
whom the British and Boers came into
contact. The first settlers were lawless
ivory-hunters who maintained a precari-
ous foothold at Port Natal (now Durban)
by lending their aid to Dingane’s wars.
The real collision between white and
black came when the Boers began trek-
king across the Drakensberg Mountains
into the fertile plains of Natal. The
atrocious massacre of Piet Retief and his
party sealed Dingane’s fate. At the
Battle of Blood River in 1838 the Boers
took a terrible vengeance and Dingane
died a hunted fugitive little more than
a year later.
Becker is no literary stylist. Occasion-
ally he lapses into a disconcerting sort of
Babu English. But he writes out of a
wide-ranging knowledge of Zulu customs
and tradition and he has provided an
authoritative account of a relatively
unfamiliar period in South African his-
tory. The maps are very poor.

Our Uncle Charlie. Elizabeth Lane. Rigby.

A book which promises the principles of
the historic peak, the automatic break-out
box, the powerful on-stop buy-order, and
the secret of unusual volume sounds so
esoteric that one’s first reaction is be-
wilderment. When a famous dancer also
announces that he will reveal the
methods by which he made a fortune on
the stock exchange, one approaches his
do-it-yourself book with caution.
Whether Nicolas Darvas’s claims are
genuine, and his methods workable, and
whether they are adaptable to Australian
conditions, I am in no position to say.
His portrayal of Wall Street as a casino
peopled with dealers, croupiers, touts,
winners and suckers seems appropriate.
In a previous book, he has described
how he made $2,000,000 in eighteen
months and this is said to have resulted
in the American Stock Exchange revising
its rules. “Wall Street” tells of his first
haphazard but lucky buying, his subse-
quent fruitless efforts to apply logic, his
discovery that the broker’s commission
made it possible to “go broke taking a
profit”, and the development of his
techno-fundamentalist or “box” system.
His basic market philosophy is not, as
the Wall Street maxim has it, to buy
cheap and sell dear, but to buy expensive
stocks which seem to be rising and to sell
stocks going down when they reach a
pre-determined low point (his “stop-loss”
order).
After intensive study of stock move-
ments, he found that they behaved with
enough consistency to be predictable—
up to a point. He visualised the move-
ment of a stock as a rubber ball boun-
cing inside a glass box and breaking into
other boxes, above or below, as the
stock rose or fell beyond certain set
points. In the world of “bulls” and
“bears” I am still inclined to doubt whe-
ther it matters if you employ a method
like Mr Darvas or pick your investments
by flinging darts at the stock reports. As
the late J. P. Morgan said concerning the
only certainty of the stock market: “It
will fluctuate.”
“Innamincka” and “Our Uncle Char-
lie” are both concerned with aspects of
Australia’s out-back past and both suffer
from amateurish writing and the over-
enthusiastic relating of events often too
personal to interest anyone but the
authors. In Elizabeth Burchill’s book,
this results in an embarrassment of ex-
clamation marks.
However, “Innamincka” (first pub-
lished in 1960) was worth reissuing for
its subject matter: the story of the
pioneering Australian Inland Mission
Nursing Service in the years before John
Flynn’s vision of welding medicine, radio
and aviation into one service became a
reality. In reporting her personal ex-
periences at the Innamincka Mission
Hospital (opened in 1928), Sister Burchill
speaks for all the AIM nurses who
brought medical attention and other com-
forts to the isolated people of the Inland.
“Old Tom must have thought he had
struck heaven this side” is how William
Hatfield described a swaggie’s reaction
when he awoke from a coma in the hos-
pital. And there must have been many
amongst the station hands, stock riders,
Afghan camel drivers, Aborigines, half-
castes and their womenfolk who thought
of Sisters Burchill and Currie as “angels”.
“Our Uncle Charlie” takes up where
“Mad as Rabbits” left off in nostalgically
reminiscing about childhood and country
life on a Victorian farm. Elizabeth Lane’s
family sound an attractive and typical
tribe; but, in writing about therry she is
a little too self-conscious to be consist-
ently funny and the prim style doesn't
quite fit the “fair dinkum” character of
the subject. Much of the description of
out-back life rings true —the smoked tea
made in the Mechanics’ Institute copper,
the buggy rides to Sunday School in all
weathers, the picnic races, the family
rows, the animals—but there are episodes
which indicate that Miss Lane is scraping
the bottom of the barrel.
The best moments concern the eccen-
tric relative of the title, a member of
that vanishing, crusty breed of individua-
lists who personify Australian cussed-
ness. Some of Uncle Charlie's escapades
and sayings are priceless. When one of
the children asks him who made the
world, he replies: “Well, you can be sure
it wasn’t your father—he couldn't make
a decent, damned chicken-coop.”

On the Burdekin
John Drysdale and the Burdekin. Roy Con-
nolly. Ure Smith. 595. 6d.
Sir Arthur Fadden, a product of the
Burdekin district, writes an introduction
to this notable book of biographical his-
tory, and Russell Drysdale adds an artis-
tic footnote.
The first people who began farming
sugar in the 1860 s in the region of the
Burdekin were very sorry for them-
selves, even though they included re-
doubtable pioneers like Robert Towns
and Sir Alexander Stuart (later Premier
of NSW). These started a plantation
south of the river on Jarvisfield —a
name which was, accidentally though
strangely, derived via the Antill estate
at Picton (NSW) and Macquarie’s
estate on Mull in Scotland, from the
first Mrs Macquarie’s family sugar
estate in Antigua. Among the people
who were sorry a little later were
members of the Drysdale-Russell clan
who acquired an interest in the district
at the beginning of the 1870 s. What
with blight, wrong types of cane, isola-
tion, rain and labor problems they must
have wished they had never seen the
place until their John Drysdale was
sent north in 1885 to see what he
could do to tidy things up. He did.
He proved to be the only thing more
powerful than the Burdekin and above
all he had a passion for foresight, neat-
ness, order and modernisation. He,
more than anybody, planned the sugar
industry and modernised it, seizing
avidly on new inventions, pioneering
irrigation and river control, and mould-
ing the processes of growing and
making sugar into a steadily improvable
routine. Above all, in the 43 years he
was the dominating figure in his particu-
lar region, come white labor, floods,
Dickson awards, or taipans and giant
toads, he never lost faith or grip and
always kept his eyes on the horizon.
His name is one of the dozen great ones
indissolubly merged into the history of
development of a region which is unique
in being the only area in the world’s
tropics entirely manned from entre-
preneur down to laborer by white men.
Not only was it proved, especially in
Drysdale’s section of the North, that
whites can live and work there, but that
they can produce conditions in which
it is a pleasure to work as anybody will
admit who has seen the Pioneer mills,
their park-like surroundings and the
modern, prosperous oleander-planted
towns that dot the Burdekin country-
side.
However, the work of John Drysdale
and the group he gathered round him
as a staff at Pioneer does not absorb
the whole interest of the book Which
also covers the whole story of the Drys-
dale-Russell family complex. The mills
and farms of the Burdekin basin and the
great cattle stations acquired for deve-
lopment further inland are only an ulti-
mate manifestation of the activities of
the clan. The family group is truly
cosmopolitan within the British Com-
monwealth and has succeeded in keep-
ing its diversification of interests ranging
from land production and merchant
banking in Scotland to merchant
adventuring and investment over the
whole length of eastern Australia, in an
integrated whole, in every part of which
its members are perfectly at home.
The finale of Mr Connolly’s attractive
volume, which might well become in a
more modest format and slightly con-
densed a useful Australian school book,
consists of 15 pages of Mr Russell
Drysdale’s lightning impressions of in-
habitants of the Burdekin region. These
have something of the haunting vivid-
ness of Leonardo’s hurried sketch of
Baronelli on the end of his rope. All
his subjects look as if they were caught
with defences down. Like his paintings
of the hot, stark streets of northern
towns they give the viewer embarrassed
moments of shock as if be had sud-
denly and by chance come on his
mother-in-law au nature!. It is fortu-
nate that Mr Drysdale’s instant per-
ceptions are never actuated by anything
but sympathy and kindliness or pity.
I should hate to have him point his
instant pencil at me in the moment in
which I was stealing his waterbag on a
hot noon in the middle of the Simpson
Desert.

Last week the Partisans
Outflanked the Democrats,
Sent a platoon out
Five miles around
A hair-raising razorback,
Came on them at the stream
And shot them to pieces.
Yesterday the Democrats
Carried their justice
Into the market town
After a brisk siege;
The Mayor and six Partisans,
Marched to the river bank,
Were shot quick and neat.
Whose machine-gun fire
Pocks the escarpment?
Who was it that sustained —-
Threatened, retreating—
Vital supply lines?
Who holds which bank of that
Neutral brown river?
Partisans, Democrats,
Black souls and white souls
Blindly confronting,
While at the river’s edge
I am drawn through harsh light
To meet my only son
In mortal combat.

Religious Mania
A Long Madness. Antonio Barolini. Gol-
lancz. 31s. 6d.
The Toyfair. Neal Faasen. Deutsch. 235.
The Liquidator. John Gardner. Muller. 235.
The traditional novel-form may no longer
correspond to our conception of modern
life but Antonio Barolini proves that
there is still nothing like it for re-
creating the artificiality of a world that
is over and done with. Set in a villa in
the Italian Veneto around the turn of
the century, “A Long Madness” has an
anachronistic flavor, as if both style and
story had just been shaken by the author
out of a dimly remembered past still
redolent with camphor and rosemary.
Maria-Assunta's religious mania (some
three decades of it) arises out of and
nourishes itself directly on the suffoca-
ting smallness of her horizons. Not
wishing to take the veil herself, she mar-
ries a landowner and then tries to im-
pose on those about her an existence full
of taboos and misguided penances, ruth-

lessly replacing any priest who attempts
to guide her hack to sanity. She is de-
termined that her only son must become
a saint; instead, she simply succeeds in
destroying him. Ultimately, not even in
a state of grace, he drinks poison offered
by her own hand while she deludes her-
self into believing that she has despatched
him straight to Heaven where they will
shortly meet. It is a compelling study of
the sin of piety—when piety is misunder-
stood. The translation, by the author’s
wife, is excellent.
Angry young men seem to be growing
younger every year. The narrator in
“The Toyfair” is only 13. The Ameri-
can writer whose promising first novel
this is looks back more in sorrow than
in anger from the vantage-point of a ripe
old 26. He is still young enough to recall
his own adolescent feelings but suffici-
ently mature to see them in perspective,
and what he has to say about youthful
rebellion and the conclusions he reaches
contain some refreshingly new twists.
The book opens with all the usual in-
gredients—a boy running away from a
broken home and unimaginative teachers
—but neatly sidesteps all those usual pit-
falls of crude precocity, mock innocence
or sentimentality and it is never Salinger-
sick. William sets out for Chicago to
try and find his vaguely remembered
father who is an alcoholic and he takes
along two angry young women with him,
Ace, a poor little rich girl and Worm, a
poor little poor girl. The journey be-
comes part pilgrimage to a memory, part
crusade for the rights of youth and part
search for a personal identity.
“The Liquidator” seems likely to
herald a new reign. There is no need to
mourn our lost James Bondage. The
King is dead; long live the King, John
Gardner! His first novel has everything
lan Fleming had plus some interesting
extras. As the Bond books were in some
respects already send-ups of the serious
spy story, the Boysie books (we trust
there will be more) threaten to become
parodies of the send-ups. Yet the
writing is not obviously farcical in itself
and will no doubt be read straight by
many readers for its own exciting sake.
Boysie Oakes, with the unfortunate
monogram 80, is the secret agent L
and his British Special Security chief
No. 2 has trained him to carry out the
stickiest liquidations, although not the
assassination of the Duke of Edinburgh
that almost ensues. There are the
familiar luxurious and bizarre settings,
the same cloak and dagger suspenses and
the same interest in wine, women and
donging one over the head. And, of
course, a delicious hierarchy of villains
unmasked in strict protocolical order
before the thrilling finale.

Two Kinds of Critic
The Critical Moment. Faber. 425. 6d.
“The Critical Moment” gathers together
seventeen essays by English and Conti-
nental critics which originally appeared
in “The Times Literary Supplement” in
1963. Contributors were asked to define
their view of literature and to comment
on the function of literary criticism it-
self. As with all symposia the result was
varied: a hotchpotch of random reflec-
tions, apercus, obiter dicta and auto-
biographical fragments.
What most strikes one reading these
essays is the difference between English
and European critics (Leavis and Wain;
Picard and Kott to mention only a few
well-known names). The European cri-
tics love theories, world views, grand
designs. Emilio Cecchi points to the
essential difference in an autobiographical
paragraph: “1 was particularly impressed
by the concrete tone and urbane hand-
ling of the English, by their refusal to
yield to the temptation to rhetoric, to
adopt complicated speculative apparatus,
and to take up too ponderous didactic
attitudes.”
Certainly complicated speculative appa-
ratus is a feature of Roland Barthe’s re-
markable “Criticism as Language"’ and
even more so of Damaso Alonso’s
“Knowledge of Literary Works”. Com-
pared with the Europeans the English
are “practical critics” and nothing more.
If they reject jargon and the grand ab-
stractions they also eliminate a certain
intellectual daring and ambition.
It is impossible to imagine any of the
English critics in this book writing as
ambitiously as Emil Staiger in “Time
and the Poetic Imagination”; but it is per-
haps equally difficult to imagine a Con-
tinental critic writing as simply and
directly as Richard Hoggart in “Why Ij
Value Literature”. “Because it insists om
the importance of the inner, the distinc-
tive, the individual life of man, while
much else in our activity and in our
make-up—fear, ambition, fatigue, lazi-
ness—seeks to make that life generalised
and typecast.”
There are several good pieces of com-
ment in this collection: notably L. C.-
Knight’s essay where he sensibly warns
against the present over-anxiety of teach-
ers to train pupils in close reading; and
W. W. Robson’s plea to restore the word
“sincere" to the critical vocabulary. His
essay is valuable in a number of ways.
“Misanthropy” is the modish word in
criticism at the moment (like sentiment
and enthusiasm in the eighteenth cen-
tury), and what Robson has to say about
misanthropy as part of the full humanity
of Shakespeare, Tolstoy and Lawrence is
particularly illuminating.

Identification
I hardly knew you from the others
there,
some half-dozen white-gowned sexless
forms
lying on benches in the refrigerated
room.
I searched for some remembrance in
each face
of indeterminate age; they each gave
back
a vaguely hostile stare from half-closed
eyes
in faces like those tight masks
children wear
at birthday parties to frighten one
another.
“I’m a witch. I'm a witch, and you
can't catch me.
I fly on my broomstick over the trees.”
That was. how long ago? Now you
have come
name-tagged and registered among the
dead
who wait for coffins, like shabby
suitcases left
at railway stations where the trains no
longer stop.
I identified the body and went out:
embalming tables lay empty, the fluids
put away;
no lead-lined casket with view-window
for you;
better the past disintegrate slowly in
silence
where no wintry sunlight can ever touch
the forlorn laughter of forgotten
children.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
The Rush to Borrow
Whatever the psychological
effect of higher bank interest
rates on the economy, Austra-
lian business houses are undoubtedly
facing a very tight situation on the
local borrowing market.
Overseas restraints on lending, a
dearer money campaign in the UK,
and an exhortation from President
Johnson for US corporations to im-
prove their individual balance of pay-
ments have sent many large organisa-
tions scurrying to the Australian
public for extra funds. Unfortunately,
with sliding share prices and a tighter
attitude from the banks, the locals are
not flush with extra cash. Those bor-
rowers who are late in the queue
will discover there is not enough money
to go round.
Those with money to lend are con-
strained to stay their hands when they
see Commonwealth Bond rate rising to
5i p.c. There are plenty of nice pick-
ings, including the £lO million deben-
ture issue by the UK-controlled Bri-
tish Petroleum Co. of Australia at
6i p.c. for seven years and 7 p.c. for
12 and 20 years.
Even at 7 p.c. the BP issue is at a
lower interest rate than available for
similar debentures in the UK, where
the company is paying 1 p.c. over
bank rate (now 7 p.c.). It poses the
thought that interest rates could rise
even higher in Australia if too many
additional borrowers enter the market.
Already GMAC, Australian Alu-
minium, United Dominions and Lom-
bard have gone to the Australian pub-
lic for funds at a time when the regu-
lar crop of local finance companies
are seeking their usual requirements.
Because of the sudden rush for
money, Mr Staniforth Ricketson sug-
gested the introduction of graduated
rates of company tax designed to favor
companies in which there was a pro-
portion of Australian equity capital.
The situation must be intensely
worrying to Australian public com-
panies which need to raise funds this
year. Even the alternative resort to
shareholders via the new share issue
market has become less attractive since
the sharp shakeout in market values.
Those who were planning sizeable
share issues at a premium must have
second thoughts, while those who
planned their premium issues some
time ago (like CRA) could find it em-
barrassing in the face of the market
setback.
CRA allayed some misgivings on its
issue of ss. shares at 345. when it
reported that 893,454 rights not being
taken up by the UK parent company,
Riotinto Zinc Corporation Ltd, have
STANIFORTH RICKETSON
been taken firm by the underwriters
and allocated at an undisclosed pre-
mium.
Life offices with funds available are
in a happy position to take advantage
of the dearer money situation, but it
puts a definite brake on general spend-
ing.
A close watch on car sales and home
building in the next few months should
reflect some influence from the dearer
money era.
Population Wins
An official of the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organisa?
tion, Dr B. R. Sen, last week warned
the world for the umpteenth time that
it faced a major crisis by the end of
the century unless steps were taken to
increase food production.
He also warned that birth control
was an urgent priority, because half the
world’s population suffered from hun-
ger or malnutrition. This situation
would become critical well before the
year 2000.
Those nations with excess primary
produce to sell are not as clinical in
their outlook as Dr Sen. They are
concerned with their balance-of-pay-
ments problems and the difficulties of
selling commodities at a reasonable
price. The cold, economic fact of
life is that the starving nations cannot
afford to buy food ... or the money
which could be spent on food for
humanitarian reasons is spent in “de-
veloping” the country.
There are two ways of looking at
this. Politicians who are well fed and
secure possibly are prepared to ignore
local starvation in the hope that extra
foreign aid can be squeezed from other
nations. The other nations, anxious
to sell their commodities, are prepared
to make only token gifts to those
nations which are unable or unwilling
to control their populations or their
balance of payments.
They argue that, if they heeded the
UN, they would produce a surplus of
food which, instead of going to needy
people, would be dumped.
Latin America, a group which has
had the benefit of substantial US aid,
is a typical example, with population
running well ahead of economic
growth. Yet a country like Argentina,
with a record wheat crop, a jump of
22 p.c. in the cost of living last year
and a balance-of-payments crisis be-
cause of rising imports, is being tipped
for a devaluation of the peso as the
only obvious means of helping the
wheat, wool and beef exporters.
Argentina is selected as an example
because it is a competitor with Aus-
tralia for wool, wheat and beef ex-
ports. Its cattle producers today are
striving to recover their previously
strong situation by rebuilding their
cattle herds. But inflation and food
demands from a rapidly growing popu-
lation are putting a strain on the capa-
city to export beef.
Despite world demands for more
food, therefore, Argentina and other

Latin American countries like Brazil
and Mexico cannot maintain an eco-
nomic growth rate to keep pace with
their own rising populations.
Argentina’s economic growth rate
rose by 5 p.c. last year, against a de-
cline of 5 p.c. in 1963. If this growth
is measured on a per capita basis,
however, population is winning the
race.
Brazil devalued its currency last
December, to help its exports, and
hopes to get a billion dollars in foreign
aid this year. Businessmen in Brazil,
Mexico and other Latin American
countries are dismal over President
Johnson’s restraint on dollar outflow
because it will remove a very valuable
prop to economies which were strug-
gling even with the advantage of dollar
loans.
Euro-Dollars Respectable
T>e ports that the Australian Govern-
ment is considering raising some
European-owned dollars at 51 p.c. is
news to the Australian public. But
those who rushed to this queue well
before the official announcement of
President Johnson’s restrictions on
dollar loans will' only snarl “Wait your
turn, mate.”
The traffic in Euro-dollars has been
going on for a few years now. Al-
though London financial circles may
deplore the loss of an Australian cus-
tomer, they would have to admit they
have been active themselves in this
field.
European dollar subscriptions for
several years now have been important
contributors to dollar loans in New
York, meaning that dollar funds in
European banks are used for subscrip-
tions to gilt-edged loans in New York.
However, it was an accepted practice
in the banking system that if you
couldn’t get a loan in New York you
could pay a little extra and get a Euro-
dollar loan in Europe from dollar funds
already deposited in Europe.
When the threat of the US Interest
Equalisation Tax caused a tightening
in US domestic dollar loans, more em-
phasis was given Euro-dollars. Ameri-
can companies with branches in Lon-
don or Europe were not averse from
taking advantage of this type of lend-
ing, because they could invest their
money at better rates than if they re-
mitted it back home.
Naturally, governments have a bet-
ter loan status than other borrowers,
yet established customers in the Euro-
dollar business no doubt have staked
their claims well before this.
It is quite possible that, with interest
rates on the rise, those companies with
dollar funds outside the US may be
tempted to take a greater interest in
this Euro-dollar market.
The only problem with Euro-dollar
lenders was that they were essentially
short-term lenders. Whether they
have developed to the stage where they
are prepared to undertake long-term
loans is yet to be proved. At this
stage they can ask —and get —satis-
factory. short-term rates.
Appeal unto Caesar
XTo names, no pack drill.
During the recent bushfires a
party of big-wigs up from the city
emerged from their limousines and
looked on while a sawmill smouldered
in the final stages of disintegration.
Said a weary and grimy firefighter:
“There goes the last of the sawdust but
I see the Caesars are still with us.”
No moral necessarily, either.
But let us hope that the aftermath
of the fires in two States (Bulletin,
March 20) results in more positive
action than similar well - meaning
endeavors in the past. Despite all the
plans, all the talk and all the public
expenditure, the fires are still with us.


FCONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Government Pressures on Business
Adelaide accountant scouts the dangers
VTow that all Australian legislatures are
' in business again after their summer
recesses it would be salutary if, as a
prelude to their forthcoming exertions, all
Parliamentarians and bureaucrats had
read and fully digested Mr N. S. Young’s
thoughts on “Business and Bureaucracy”
in the February number of the “Austra-
lian Accountant”. This Adelaide accoun-
tant has taken a hard and deep look at
the need for better understanding of
business by governments, in the spirit that
it should be made clear to the politician
and the bureaucrat that we are not will-
ing to become subordinated to what Sir
Robert Menzies once called the “univer-
sal officialdom of government”.
It is not that Mr Young thinks the
lack of understanding between govern-
ment and business is one-sided. “When
those of us,” he states, “who are con-
cerned with the affairs of the private
sector criticise the bureaucrat and the
politician, we are only justified in doing
so when we have made a conscientious
effort to understand the facts and the
considerations which lie beyond the de-
cision or the action about which we com-
plain, and where we can put forward a
practical alternative.
“The politician and the bureaucrat, on
the other hand,” Mr Young continues,
“are under an equal obligation to acquire
a real comprehension of the operation
of private business and how vital it is to
the maintenance and growth of the
national economy.” Indeed, as was said
in this column last week, the success of
private business sets limits to the acti-
vities of governments themselves. We
cannot afford to discard the risk-taking
disciplines in a free enterprise system—
the spirit of independence and initiative
characteristic of the successful business
unit, large or small. If the latter is
crabbed or cramped by official edicts, it
can't be expected to deliver the necessary
goods required by the assumption of full
employment with its social welfare
riders.
In Canberra, as Mr Young sees it,
there is still an incomplete understanding
of the practical problems which have
been created by our adoption or accep-
tance of the political philosophy of full
employment and all that such a philoso-
phy demands.
He echoes a hope, expressed here and
elsewhere many times, that when we face
the crises of the future the Cabinet of
the day will not have to rely exclusively
on the advice of the Treasury as to how
these crises should be dealt with. He
agrees with Sir John Crawford’s view
in his 1963 John Storey Memorial Lec-
ture that “it is the prime task of manage-
ment in private enterprise and govern-
ment to establish permanent machinery
for closer working relations in the effort
to find those solutions which seem best
to fit with the national interest of Aus-
tralia”.
Mr Young hopes that the Vernon re-
port, whose release is now expected for
early May, will recommend the establish-
ment of a permanent economic secreta-
riat in Canberra attached to the PM’s
Department, under a council with mem-
A. C. GOODE
bers drawn from both public and private
sectors.
The suggestion is that such a sounding-
board would reduce the risks of the sort
of measures being taken like those the
Treasury used in November, 1960;
measures “which seemed not only to lack
reality but to be badly timed” and as
result of which private business interests
“suffered a great deal of disorganisation
and, in some cases, considerable losses”.
Talking about those measures reminds
us that the Vernon Committee, whose
composition itself is the very sort that
would seem appropriate for a counsel-
ling body in Canberra, has been advised
by some financiers to consider recom-
mending a tax-on-interest on fixed inter-
est borrowings of Australian capital by
overseas-owned firms operating here. I
have always been dead against this sort
of fiscal interference in any shape or
form. So it is important that what Ml
A. C. Goode, the Melbourne financier,
had to say against the proposal last week
is carefully noted.
He was not pointing so much to it as
being bad in principle and an unwar-
ranted interference with legitimate busi-
ness. He was stressing more the
desirability, for the balance of payments
among other reasons, of retaining the
interest payments on fixed interest bor-
rowings by overseas-owned firms in
Australia. In addition, in his view, the
Australian capital market is now fully
capable of handling these needs of over-
seas-owned firms.
On the score of ill-considered Govern-
ment interference, Mr Young was think-
ing not only of the overall problem of
controlling the economy but also of par-
ticular examples of interference in differ-
ent fields. One of these, the reform of
company legislation, again came to the
forefront in Victoria last week. Another,
restrictive trade practices, seems likely
to do so shortly in the Federal sphere.
The classic example, he stated, was
Victoria's Companies (Public Borrow-
ings) Act 1963, “produced in haste, in
an atmosphere of secrecy and panic,
without consultation with professional
and business interests and in the end
result is unlikely to achieve its express
purpose, namely, the provision of greater
protection for the investor”. This Act,
it must be said, was conceived hurriedly
but not without consultation with busi-
ness. In fact the Stock Exchange was
closely in touch with the Attorney-
General in its preparation and a number
of other commercial bodies were con-
sulted as well. None the less, Mr Young
has not been alone in criticising the Act.
Some of these criticisms have got home
and last week an amending Bill to this
barely year-old Act was introduced into
the Victorian legislature and other States
may be congratulating themselves on
their tardiness in failing to follow Vic-
toria’s precipitate lead in 1963. Now
they will have before them Mr Rylah’s
latest refinements. As well as providing
some escape routes for companies in the
requirement for interim reporting (both
half-yearly and quarterly), the new Bill
also gives the State even wider powers;
for instance, to appoint inspectors into
companies in the public interest and to
call up people for interrogation into the
ownership of shares and debentures and
into transactions in them.
Mr Rylah’s latest second thought is
to allow a trustee discretionary power


to dispense with audited half-yearly ac-
counts in the case of public borrowing
corporations with only small borrowings,
where the assets are large in relation to
such borrowings or where he is satisfied
there is a satisfactory system of continu-
ous internal audit. Equally, some of the
generally considered “impossible” re-
quirements now laid down for quarterly
interim reports are likely to disappear.
The most wide-sweeping of these con-
cerns a board’s liability under the existing
Act to report quarterly to the trustees
on “any” event which might affect par-
ticular public borrowings by a company.
This, certainly, should never have been in
the Act.
In view of the back-pedalling in the
matter of half-yearly accounts, it is hard
to believe that Mr Rylah consulted
widely over the range of big companies
registered in Victoria to find out what
difficulties they would face in presenting
audited balance sheets and profit and
loss accounts every half-year. (This is
something even the stock exchanges
have balked at.) Why should the
Attorney-General have had to wait
about fifteen months after the Act was
passed to hear from Broken Hill Pro-
prietary, the biggest company in the
Commonwealth, of these difficulties in
a report to its shareholders? In BHP’s
case the requirement has caused the
company to delay giving any profit and
loss figures for the half-year to Novem-
ber 30 last until pretty well the close of
its full financial year on May 31!
What is required in these particular
cases where governments feel the need
for drastic interventions in business is
to scout the ground thoroughly before
they rush in. Mr Young finds the classic
example of not doing this in the Federal
Government's failure to appoint a com-
mission of men with wide experience to
examine the need for legislation on re-
strictive trade practices, another matter
on which legislation is likely in the next
few months. He asks, “Why did the
Government appoint a commission of
one instead of a commission of larger
number?”
Considering the tortuous course of the
Barwick proposals through the mill of
public opinion since they were formula-
ted in December, 1962, perhaps even the
Government wishes it had surveyed the
ground more thoroughly at the begin-
ning. At any rate the legislation has not
come to light yet. When it does the
period of public examination and opinion
testing by the Attorney-General may be
found to have been well spent. The
Government may indeed have learned a
good lesson in this case; that is, not to
take political decisions likely to have a
far-reaching and damaging effect on the
private sector without first making a
serious effort to enlist the co-operation
and advice of those interests likely to be
affected by the legislation and before any
decision is taken on the basic principles
of such legislation.
Mr Young leaves his biggest rebukes
for the bureaucrats. Whilst in a formal
sense we speak of the importance of the
political or government decision, and try
to measure its effects on private business,
in his view it cannot be disputed that
many such decisions are bureaucratically
inspired. Whilst frequently this inspiration
is based on good faith, in many cases the
official recommendation reflects a narrow
outlook and lack of concern as to the
effect of the legislation on private busi-
ness activity. “One cannot ignore the
natural desire for power and authority
which must find expression in the ambi-
tions and outlook of the official, just as
it does in the case of those striving for
position and status in the business com-
munity.”
In the former case, however, the im-
pact of these personal ambitions is like-
ly to be felt on a much wider front.
Evidence of this is seen not only in
public administration as it impacts on
private business and on private citizens
but in the clashes which occur, in Can-
berra, on inter-departmental committees.
Any growth in the power and authority
of bureaucracy stemming from a politi-
cal decision is likely to be further ex-
tended in the course of the administra-
tion of the political decision and is
almost certain to lead to the imposition
of restraints on the private sector and to
frustrations and additional costs.
CROESUS
Cutting the Coat to the Cloth
Education hand-outs in economic perspective
Tf the Federal Government is as much
worried as its counsel in the basic
wage hearing suggests about fitting de-
fence priorities to the tight resources
situation, it seems rather astounding that
so much will be piled on the education
bill as a result of the Martin Com-
mittee's report. No wonder the Govern-
ment is more worried about the possibili-
ties of excess demand appearing in the
economy than it apparently is that in-
dustrial costs will go over the hill. This
column does not wish to criticise the
reasoning behind the projected increase
in spending on tertiary education. In-
deed such expenditure is probably highly
desirable. Yet an old adage must be
recalled: even an economy like ours
v cannot have its cake and eat it.
We get back to fundamental questions
of the allocation of available resources
in an economy where social welfare and
basic services development are regarded
by the Government as of over-riding
importance, but in which employment
depends fundamentally on the success
of private enterprise. The effect of the
high demands of the public sector should
be measured against the strength of the
private sector. Everything has to be con-
sidered in a setting where, as the pressure
for higher wages exemplifies, the last
thoughts are for industrial costs and
reduced personal consumption.
Of course, if the Government keeps
on piling all these new demands on re-
sources, it is only reasonable for it to be
fearing demand inflation and for Mr Kerr
to point this out to the Arbitration Com-
mission lest it throw in another hostage.
In my view, though, the immediate
danger to the economy from internal
influences lies more in cost inflation.
Given the pressures on prices from this
direction, the result could very easily
be a slackening in economic activity
coupled with rising prices—in fact, the
worst of all worlds.
Industry is already in a fairly tight
and vulnerable position on the costs
side. The £1 rise in the basic wage last
year, not to speak of subsequent rises in
wages engineered on the open market,
has narrowed profit margins at a time
when structural difficulties have emerged
in industry. These difficulties are partly
the result of normal industrial tendencies
to over-run market possibilities on the
up-stage of a business cycle. Equally,
industry in general is now heavily loaded
with overhead costs, which it would be
uneconomic to carry in the event of
prime costs being increased much more
(or the market being reduced). Such
costs inevitably increase strongly in pro-
longed periods of capacity working.
For while income generation both
from Government sources and industry
is still going at full tilt, that from indus-
trial production may well slacken in the
coming months if the combined effect
of costs inflation and competition from
imports forces dismissals in some indus-
tries. In its March review, the Com-
mercial Bank of Australia points up the
dangers in this direction in these terms:
“With the current strong demand for
imported goods there is a distinct danger
that any further increases in local costs
will result in imported goods becoming
even more competitive ... If local
manufacturers have pruned profits down
to minimum levels, then any increased

intensity in competition from imports
would seriously threaten industry.”
As for external influences on the
economy, there is no doubt that these
will exert a deflationary effect in the
next twelve months which to some extent
should mitigate the effects of internal
pressures on prices both from the demand
and costs sides. On the other hand, if
the balance of payments is going to
deteriorate in the manner now generally
expected, it behoves the Government not
to go ahead baldly with its high spend-
ing programmes on all fronts but to cut
its cloth, more in conformity with the
sort of coat that will be there when
the projected drop in""reserves has taken
place.
What that drop in reserves will be is
anybody’s guess. The National Bank
thinks it will be confined to £lOO mil-
lion for 1964-65, while the Commercial
Bank of Australia, taking a very long
shot indeed, has put a figure of-£2OO mil-
lion on the likely fall in the following
year. The National may certainly be
pretty near the mark on the figure for
the current year. How on earth the CBA
arrives at its projection for 1965-66 de-
feats me, though the drop could very
well be of that dimension.
The real point is that, if these mas-
sive falls in overseas reserves are going
to take place, this is the time for the
Government to be cutting back its own
spending programmes rather than piling
more demands on the private sector
to satisfy its own full spending ambi-
tions and giving an open invitation to
inflation. The Government needs to re-
think the whole position of its spending
in this new situation. Otherwise it could
be left in a position where, with over-
seas sources of income generation, ex-
port income and, capital inflow having
wilted, its own inflated expenditures
could only be carried on under the threat
of a balance-of-payments crisis.
With reserves still very high and the
big prospective drain still some way
off, it is unlikely that an expansive
Government would start here and now
to taper its spending programmes, even
though Dr Coombs says his latest inter-
est rate moves have been taken in the
light of longer-term balance of pay-
ments and overseas reserves possibilities.
Nonetheless, it is surprising that the
Government is taking the opposite
course and piling commitments like that
for tertiary education on its long-term
spending programmes.
One of the reasons for this lack of
foresight would appear to be that the
Government advisers have not fully
appreciated, as Dr Coombs seems to have
done, the rapidity which which the re-
serves position could well deteriorate.
Maybe it has been taken too much for
granted that capital inflow is going to
come to the rescue of the current account
balance of payments, as it has over the
last eight months when a series of visible
trade deficits have resulted in a fall of
only £6O million or so in reserves and
still left these as high as £794 million at
the end of February.
Another possible reason why the
Government considers it can go full
steam ahead on its spending fronts is
that it seems not to have detected the
tricky situation in which a fully extend-
ed private sector finds itself as a result of
cost pressure mentioned above. In them-
selves these should dictate caution in
Government spending.
Taking a supine view of industrial
prospects, it could hardly be that the
Government believes that the lower rate
of imports in February was a flash in the
pan. Sensibly, it must take the view that
imports are not yet over the hump. For
though there are signs that industrial
production could slip back a little in
tempo, with the more cautious business
attitudes now emerging, the continued
strength of fixed investment and Govern-
ment spending should continue to keep
them at a high level.


More Than Seasonal Sparkle
Good cheer from the soft drink industry
Thirsty Australians are consuming
more soft drinks than ever before.
The more they drink, the bigger the
industry’s problems become.
From production of 83,224,000 gal-
lons of aerated waters and 5,448,000
gallons of cordials and syrups in 1961-
62, output has grown rapidly. In 1962-
63 it reached 87,365,000 gallons of
aerated waters and 6,259,000 of cordials
and syrups. In the 1963-64 financial
year production stood at a record
91,623,000 and 6,999,000 gallons respec-
tively for aerated waters and cordials and
syrups.
Following reasonably good summers
in all States, production for the 1964-65
year seems certain to reach the 96 mil-
lion gallon mark and could well pass
the 100 million gallon level by the end
of the next financial year. There are
many reasons for this increase in both
production and consumption. Firstly,
there is an ever-growing proportion of
teenagers (the biggest market) in the
population.
Coupled with this is the well-recog-
nised fact that teenagers today have
greater spending power than ever before.
Promotion by the industry of soft drinks
for the family and an intensive campaign
to interest adults in soft drinks is also
paying off. Vending machines (refri-
gerated cabinets), which can be seen at
service stations, canteens, schools and the
like, have also added tremendously to
sales.
While the cola-type drinks enjoy an
enormous share of the American soft
drink market, the position in Australia
is noticeably different. Here the leading
flavor is lemonade, second is orange, and
the third is colas. One industry obser-
ver said that this had been the position
for some years and was “unlikely” to
change in the near future.
“I think the bigger cola manufac-
turers have been picking up sales from
the others in the industry who have not
paid a great deal of attention to this
flavor. But while cola sales have in-
creased, they still take third place in the
flavor stakes. I can’t see any reason
for this changing until more emphasis
is placed on the take-home pack rather
than the individual bottle sold over the
counter. As home consumption increases,
so will the cola’s share of the market.”
With an expanding market comes the
problem of bottles and crates. People
in the soft drink industry The Bulletin
spoke to all agreed that by far the big-
gest single capital outlay the industry
had to make was in bottles and crates.
Yet once bottles and crates have been
provided for, the expense still does not
stop. There is a certain amount of
wastage and breakage to take into
account. While the industry recently
upped the deposit on bottles to 4d. to
provide a more equitable return on the
higher prices it had to pay for the glass,
there is no doubt the increase also had
the effect of making people more return-
conscious.
With the containers comes the attend-
ant worry of storage. In the cooler
months (generally speaking from May to
October) when sales are at their lowest
ebb, manufacturers have to find room for
the millions of bottles which, in the sum-
mer; are difficult to recover to cope with
the enormous lift in production. The
industry does not seem particularly in-
terested in stockpiling during the winter
(in June last year, for instance, it turned
out only 4.3 million gallons, while in
December, production was more than
13 million gallons), but tends more to
maintenance and overhaul of the very
expensive machinery it uses.
The industry could certainly produce
much greater quantities in the cooler
months. The main reason given for the
low level of output was that manufac-
turers preferred to get their products on
the market as fresh as possible, thus
avoiding any likelihood of discoloration
or deterioration of the drinks.
In the soft drink industry there is, un-
fortunately, a great deal of overcapacity
in the winter months. For a seasonal
industry this is naturally unavoidable,
though attempts are being made to in-
crease winter consumption, apparently
with only minor success.
The introduction of canned soft drinks
is being watched with interest by the
industry. Sales trends cannot be accur-
ately determined, since there is no break-
down of bottle sales compared with can
sales. However, the industry is extremely
keen to find a cheap non-returnable con-
tainer to minimise storage and recovery
problems.
Here again difficulties arise. Firstly,
there is the cost of the can and the ex-
pense of setting up a canning line. Then
to sell them, the soft drink manufacturers
must be able to offer a product of a
quality and at a price consistent with the
more expensive can. An executive of
one of the companies The Bulletin
interviewed put it this way:
“We would certainly like to put our
drinks in cans, though there are several
inherent disadvantages that have to be
overcome. There is absolutely nothing
to stop us putting our drinks in cans.
If we do, however, it would mean that
the price we’d have to sell them at could
drive customers away. It’s different with
beer. Beer is not a cheap item, so
canning is justified but, as far as our
company is concerned at the moment,
soft drink canning is not an economic
proposition. There are some canned
soft drinks available at the moment —
those put out by Schweppes and Tarax.”
There has been a great deal of take-
over activity in the soft drink industry
in recent months. Most of it has come
at the hands of British Tobacco. Through
Associated Products and Distribution
Pty Ltd, of which British Tobacco owns
51 p.c., the face of the industry has
changed markedly. Recently AP and D
purchased a controlling interest in Shel-
ley’s Drinks Ltd, of Sydney (for more
than £l+ million), the soft drink in-
terests of Marchant and Co. Ltd for
£708,000, and Helidon Gardner Pty
Ltd, Brisbane’s largest privately owned

Wliat Australian State lias
eleven overseas ports?
The answer is Queensland the eleven are the Ports of
Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhamp-
ton, Mackay, Bowen, Townsville, Lucinda, Mourilyan and
Cairns.
With the completion of current projects Queensland will have
more major ports than the rest of Australia put together.
By this yardstick, as by most, Queensland is ready to meet
the needs of dramatically developing industries.
Queensland is the most decentralised of all the Australian
States, its natural wealth, population and industries being
spread over a very wide area. As a result, expenditure on
development has covered the same wide pattern. Cities and
towns throughout the State can provide all the services
manufacturers look for. These include power, water supply,
sewerage, industrial sites, skilled labour, road, rail, sea and air
transport. Local Authority rates and services, land values and
building costs in Queensland compare more than favourably
with those in other Australian States.
Queensland for years has known where she is going and has
planned for the future on a scale corresponding to her size
and growth capacity.
In its friendly tradition, Queensland has created an organisa-
tion to assist prospective investors in local industry. The
Director of the new Department of Industrial Development,
Sir David Muir, and his well informed senior staff will be
pleased to advise you objectively on all matters of industrial
significance. As a preliminary, why not write for data on the
facilities at Queensland’s eleven overseas ports?

soft drink company. Although no price
was disclosed for this acquisition it is
believed to be between £500,000 and
£1 million. AP and D has also acquired
Mynor cordials (of NSW).
An executive of one of Sydney’s lead-
ing soft drink manufacturers said the
industry was trying to sell more, par-
ticularly in cooler months, by what he
called “intelligent advertising”. “An
instance of this is the effort we’re making
to introduce a soft drink break instead
of a coffee break. By appealing to the
family, and to the older person, we are
also making headway with our sales.
“We’re pushing the family angle by
the use of one-drink bottles, which are
handy when watching television, and
advertising in time-spots when the family,
particularly the older members, are most
likely to be viewing or listening. All
this is having the effect of increasing
sales at a rate similar to that evident in
the United States.”
Another bottler spoke of the problem
of stocks. “Demand soars tremendously
in hot weather and we must juggle our
production from day to day to keep up
with demand. We cannot produce too
far ahead, otherwise drinks go stale. Nor
can we change production at a moment's
notice. And if there’s any industrial
trouble, all we can hope to do is keep
the retailer up to date with his stocks.
“If, in summer, there is a period of
seven to ten days of cool weather, then
we finish up with too much stock on our
hands. During a heatwave the industry
is flat out trying to meet orders.”
The question of the use of the cera-
mic label bottle as against the paper
label bottle brings differing opinions.
One spokesman said that by using a
bottle with a ceramic label, part of the
promotional value of the label is des-
troyed. “For instance, at Christmas the
bottler who doesn’t use ceramic labels
can put ‘Happy Christmas’ or some such
/ message on his bottles, thereby giving
himself a little bit of extra impact in his
advertising. Since the plain bottle is
cheaper, the cost of wastage is reduced.”
On the other side of the coin a pro-
ponent of ceramic labels on bottles said
that they presented a better image “and,
apart from that, we don’t have to pay for
labels or labelling machinery. People
are more likely to return the bottle
when they know who it belongs to.
When paper labels get washed off there
is confusion about who is the owner”.
The soft drink industry in Australia
seems to be firmly in place. Major
manufacturers (with the exception of
one or two) operate mainly in the capital
cities and leave the sale of soft drinks
In the country to the country bottler.
It seems to work well this way. Provided
our summers maintain their record of
heat there seems to be no reason why
the industry should not grow larger.

Reservations on Optimism
Long haul for Electronic Industries
Shareholders should not be too
heavily swayed by the buoyant
figures from Electronic Industries’ interim
report last week. Chairman and managing
director Sir Arthur Warner predicted pro-
fits of £715,000 for the full financial year,
barring any unforeseen economic distur-
bances. This would indeed be an excellent
result for the group, yet it would only be
a very small step toward recovery and a
more respectable earning rate.
Calculated on ordinary capital at June
30 last, and after deducting preference
dividends, the figure would equal a
mediocre 12.5 p.c. on capital. This would
not be a particularly wide cover for the
10 p.c. dividend. Moreover, earnings
must enable a 12} p.c. dividend before a
full recovery can be claimed. Such was
the payout for the 15 years from 1948-49
to 1962-63. In the three years until
last year’s 10 p.c., the distribution was
not covered by profits anyway.
The question is, can the group find
enough cash after dividends to finance
the expansion which is planned and badly
needed to boost its performance? Expan-
sion by share issue is largely out of the
question, since the increased dividend
commitment may necessitate further cuts
in the payout. This is something directors
are hoping to avoid. Another problem
will be to bring new ventures to a profit-
able stage quickly, as unrecouped expan-
sion costs could also endanger dividends
(especially in 1966-67, when a full tax
liability will be payable).
Fortunately the problem of meeting a
full tax commitment should not be very
great. Sir Arthur said last week that the
effect of lower taxes payable at present
had been offset by extra provisions made
for future bad debts, depreciation of
plant, and obsolescence of stock and
equipment on rental. Therefore, present
profits could be regarded as normal.
However, the hole in this approach is the
denial of the possibility that these extra
provisions may continue to be necessary
to some extent when full tax liability is
incurred.
Stronger Bags
t'p.HE issue hopes of National Bag share-
holders took another step forward
after the interim report last week. If
profits are maintained at the levels
achieved in the December half-year,
earning rate for the full twelve months
will come out at around 35 p.c. Last
year’s figure was 25.3 p.c.
This will provide substantial scope for
an issue of some description, without
narrowing to any dangerous extent the
cover for the 10 p.c. dividend. The
interim report announced that a steady
interim of 5 p.c. would be distributed.
Shareholders have been expecting an
issue for some time now. Many have
hopes for a bonus, considering the big
margin which reserves have over the paid
capital. The last few years have been
extremely profitable and successful for
the group, which operates through nine
subsidiaries in the manufacture of a
variety of packaging materials. The

most recent issue to shareholders was
in 1959-60, almost five years ago. The
10 p.c. dividend has been paid for the
last eleven years. In that time earning
rate has only dipped below 20 p.c. on
one occasion.
Of course the fact that another record
will be set in the current year will'make
the group even more attractive as a
takeover proposition. Approaches have
been far from infrequent since the last
shareholders’ issue and rumors of same
have been even more so. The large inter-
est held by the Abrahams family makes
the task rather difficult, however, unless
the price is right.
Fibre Containers spent two months of
last year negotiating with the board at a
price of more than 275. for each ss.
share, but nothing came of the pro-
ceedings and National Bag carries on
intact. Informed observers believed at
the time that 31s. was the asking price
for each share. This will undoubtedly
rise if 1964-65 turns out to be as good
as expected.
Subtler Issues
firm controlling hand of Consoli-
dated Gold Fields lies over tin
miner Renison’s four-for-five premium
issue. The issue of 1,446,400 ss. shares,
foreshadowed late in 1964, will be made
at a 355. premium, against a ruling
market price of around 545. 6d.
This is the sort of process Australian
investors will just have to get used to.
It fits in very well with UK (and
European) practice, where new issues are
pitched much more closely to market
criteria than has been common here.
Such a method clearly leads to a
deeper evaluation of any given
exact market status and also calls for
keener underwriting.
In this case, Consolidated Gold Fields
tackles the underwriting itself, as well
as lending Renison £1 million linked with
a three-year option to take up 400,000
Renison shares at 50s.
Loan and issue provide Renison with
the £4 million needed to bring its tin
output to 1500 tons a year.

scheme, they are offered £l5 cash plus
30 ss. shares in the reconstructed com-
pany. Second, the £400,000 in new funds
on which the scheme depends must be
out into the trustee’s hands before an
application for the approval of the -
scheme goes before the Supreme Court.
With this and the trustee’s approval, the
.scheme has a much enhanced chance of
gaining the vital sanction of the Court.
The trustee feels that the amendments
provide protection against the risk
&f the scheme coming into operation
without a firm financial basis. Putting it
-’oore bluntly, this means that noteholders
not find themselves with only £l5
.and 30 shares in a company which has
no future because the £400,000 needed
tc launch it cannot be raised. Hard cash
and not the promises of directors will be
the foundations on which the future rests.
Despite this somewhat sudden change
in future prospects, the trustee urges
noteholders to make their own decision.
It will not exercise proxies at its own
discretion, perhaps indicating that the
cherry may not be as good as it looks.
The necessary meetings are scheduled for
April 12.
Troubles , Troubles
Tust how much managerial bungling
” are the shareholders of Second
Century Corporation expected to put up
with? After last year’s hullabuloo the
group has come out with one of the most
shocking interim reports of all time.
An overall deficit of some £90,000
was scored for the December six months.
At the annual meeting last year the chair-
man told shareholders that the company
was “not operating at a loss”. An awful
lot must have gone wrong in two months.
One subsidiary, Colmax Electric, lost
£48,000. At the annual meeting it was
stated that group results depended to a
large extent on Colmax reaching its profit
target, but the chairman would not dis-
close that target under questioning, nor
would he give any indication of W'hat the
previous year’s result had been.
Some of the discrepancies in these
statements are explained in the interim
report. It turns out that the audited
accounts to June last and the drafts for
the three months to September 30 were
incorrect. This was not discovered until
after the annual meeting. A convenient
time to make such a discovery, no doubt.
Even if such a comment is rather harsh,
the fact remains that five months have
passed since the annual meeting, yet last
week’s announcement w'as the first news
of the mistakes.
Around £32,000 of the Colmax loss
should actually have been included in
the 1963-64 accounts. This means that


Company Meeting:
GENERAL INDUSTRIES LTD.
Extracts from the report by the chairman, Mr J. B. Clarkson,
presented at the annual general meeting, held on March 26,
1965.
I am pleased to report to
you again an appreciable in-
crease in our trading profit
for the year, together with a
continuation of the improve-
ment in the Group’s position
generally.
Much attention has been
given to the design of our
new products during 1964,
some of which will not come
into production until later in
the current year.
METTERS LIMITED
The acceptance of our
consumer products nationally
has increased and particularly
good progress has been made
by our Metters’ divisions
throughout Australia with
new models of gas and elec-
tric stoves manufactured at
the Bankstown and Foots-
cray plants. During the year,
Metters consolidated its posi-
tion as Australia’s largest
manufacturer of these ap-
pliances.
Metters’ division in West
Australia expanded its
foundry operations by the
introduction of new lines of
soil pipe and by increased
activity in the agricultural
and pressure pipe fields, using
locally smelted Wundowie
iron.
Very satisfactory trading
was experienced by the Met-
ters’ division in South Aus-
tralia, where the range of
agricultural and stainless steel
products was considerably
widened and also the produc-
tion of stainless steel cook-
ware was successfully intro-
duced.
Ferro Precision Pty. Ltd.,
the Group’s soil pipe manu-
facturing subsidiary, has been
consolidated as a division of
Metters Ltd., trading as
“Metters Ferropre”. This
division traded profitably
throughout the year and
achieved a high level of sales.
Sales of our sanitaryware
and other consumer products
showed satisfactory increases
and were materially assisted
by the release of new designs.
The general pattern of
trading in the consumer pro-
ducts with which we are
associated has followed
previous trends —that is, in-
creasing production volume
with reducing profit margins.
This increased volume, which
appears to be keeping step
with our growing population,
is still not sufficient to fully
utilise the appliance industry’s
capacity to manufacture.
Accordingly, the keen corm
petition experienced during
1964 will continue in the
foreseeable future.
Fortunately, cost savings
have been effected within
our companies as a result of
the reorganisation carried
out over recent years.
GRIMWOOD
ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS
PTY. LTD.
Record levels in the pro-
duction of heating elements
were achieved by the Grim-
wood Electrical Products
company and this company’s
share of the market was con-
siderably increased.
GENERAL TUBING
PTY. LTD.
The production capacity
of General Tubing Pty. Ltd.
was increased to meet the
growing demand for-stainless
steel tubing, both at home
and abroad.
U.K. DEVELOPMENT
In the Grimwood opera-
tion, as previously reported,
an export trade has been
developed over recent years.
We have had particular
success in the development
of the United Kingdom mar-
ket and the company has now
considered it expedient to
build a manufacturing plant
for the production of radiant
heating elements in Skelmers-
dale, Lancashire, England,
in order to consolidate this
trade. This plant will operate
as the United Kingdom
.branch of Grimwood Elec-
trical Products Pty. Limited,
and is scheduled to com-
mence manufacturing within
the next two months.
EXPORT SALES
Throughout the Group, a
successful drive for increased
export sales was conducted
during the year and most of
our companies haye now
secured export business,
which is progressively grow-
ing in importance to us.
STAFF
Without the loyal support
and special effort put for-
ward by all members of the
Group’s management and
staff during the year, the pro-
gress I have reported could
not have been achieved. I
take this opportunity of
again expressing the Board’s
and my own personal ap-
preciation to all concerned.
BUOYANT TRADING
Our Metters’ divisions, in
particular, have shared in
the buoyancy experienced in
the building industry during
1964. The increased emphasis
on defence must ultimately'
affect the level of home build-
ing, particularly in view of
the general shortage of
skilled labour. However,
barring some national emer-
gency or downturn in the
economy, which appears most
unlikely, all indications point
to a continuation of the
present buoyancy in the
building industry generally.
Satisfactory trading is cur-
rently being experienced and
I am confident that the Com-
pany will continue to pro-
gress during the present year.

Chairman.

the poor result last year was actually
even more of a loss than the accounts
showed. Colmax has been reorganised
over the last few months and the direc-
tors are expecting profits of reasonable
proportions from April onwards. True
as this may be, few shareholders will be
putting much store on the prediction.
Less Than Candid
HThe evasiveness of so much of this
A season’s interim reporting is, regret-
tably, nowhere more apparent than in
the latest statement from Marrickville
Holdings. With the ten-pin bowling
companies all under pressure, directors
have seen fit to make no mention of their
subsidiary Olympic Bowling Centres.
Of course, they may well claim that
this specific activity represents a relatively
small proportion of the group’s range.
Yet in a year when it appears possible
that consolidated profits may droop for
the first time since listing, a greater
measure of candour was surely called for.
Nothing, also, has been said about
current trends in profitability, despite the
December half-year’s profit decline on
higher all-round sales.
Rising raw material costs, especially
of edible tallow, are proving the chief
bugbear. It seems only fair to say that
directors do report “steps in progress”
to battle with commodity price fluctua-
tions.
A steady p.c. interim dividend is
payable, in accord with the last four
years’ full 15 p.c. rate. The 1963-64
profit, at £613,127, gave an earning rate
of 20.8 p.c.

ber six months, compared with a loss
of £2737 in the first half of the previous
year. Last year’s full loss was £11,399.
It compared with a loss of some £15,000
previously and a profit of similar pro-
portions in the year before that.
Although an interim dividend has not
been declared, there is a good chance
of a return to the lists in the current
year. The last payout was a 3 p.c.
interim in 1962-63, the £15,000 loss year.

said profits eased slightly in the Decem-
ber half-year despite a sales rise, due
to increased material and labor costs
which could not be offset by any lift in
selling prices.
In 1963-64 the company earned its
first profit after four years on the public
lists. It was £15,000, equalled 4 p.c. on
capital and reduced accumulated losses
to around £43,000. The figure will be
reduced again this year, apparently, but
it is unlikely that a profit of dividend-
paying proportions will be earned.
In the December six months concrete
n sonry activities actually returned
greater profits, but a heavier loss in the
pre-stressed concrete division offset the
improvement. Management problems
contributed to the poor effort, as well
as higher operating costs. According to
directors, positive action is being taken
to solve them.
If these matters are resolved, 1965-66
could turn out to be the best year ever
and the first permanent step toward im-
provement. A second block-making plant
for the masonry division will come into
action at the beginning of the year, lifting
capacity substantially. Providing the
extra production can be marketed at
profitable prices, shareholders may even
see a dividend unless directors adopt a
policy of eliminating accumulated losses
first.
Brewers’ Kingdom
"Oreweries continue to prosper and
distribute liberally to shareholders.
The Foster Brewing Co. lifted profit to a
peak £53,611 in the year to the end of
January. A 14 p.c. dividend, the highest
since the bonus issue of 1959, requires
£52,415. The Shamrock Brewing Co.
chalked up a £58,846 profit in the year
to December 31, of which £57,421 will
be paid to shareholders in the form of
a higher 12i p.c. dividend.
However, the holdings of Carlton and
United Breweries shares, which these
companies have, provide much more
interesting study. Foster has £493,000
worth at directors’ 1959 valuation. At
January 31 this holding was actually
worth £1,285,000 on the market. Sham-
rock is in a similar position. A book
value of £508,000 is vastlv exceeded by
the market value of £1,373,000 at
balance date.
Savoy Sell-out
npHE valuable avenue of home finance
which building societies can provide
was highlighted again last week. Savoy
Corporation, under receivership, sold
Melbourne’s Langridge Mutual Per-
manent Building Society to a group of
overseas companies, price undisclosed.
No doubt it is below the £l2 10s. which
Savoy paid for every £5 share less than
a year ago. The bid had been inflated
to some extent owing to the fact that two
other companies had been in the battle
for takeover before Savoy finally won
out.
And with unsecured creditors banging
on the door, receivers would have been
only too glad to snap up the opportunity
of selling off one of the subsidiaries, so
one cannot imagine them bickering over
the price.
The consortium of buyers comprises
Mercantile Credits, the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation, the
London Assurance and Unity Life Assur-
ance. A rather more impressive parent
than Savoy could ever make. The group
intends to develop Langridge along
sound lines into an important avenue of
home finance, presumably via the in-
jection of overseas capital.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Hotelier Plus Property Owner
Higher dividend chances for Wynyard Holdings
T ast week the subject was one of the
oldest hotels in Sydney. This week’s
subject is one of the newest. A certain
amount of qualification is required.
First, Wynyard Holdings Ltd is a
property owner rather than an hotelier,
as its income is derived from rentals
for shops and offices and from car park-
ing as well as from the hotel, which is
managed by Federal Hotels. Secondly,
the hotel has been in existence for some
time as a “beer house”, although the
residential part is certainly the latest
addition of any consequence near to the
centre of the city (which I take as Mar-
tin Place).
In December, 1960, the public was
offered the opportunity of participating
in the development of the site and paid
capital was to be increased to £1 million.
The prospectus issued at that time
indicated that a further £1 million would
be sought in equity capital. The pro-
spectus stated: “Future issues of equity
capital will be offered in the first instance
to the then existing shareholders, other
than shares reserved for the hotel
management and debenture financiers.”
Another amount of £2.5 million was to
be raised by debentures.
But December, 1960, was not the best
time to float a property development
company. Only the amount underwritten
was subscribed, so paid ordinary capital
was increased to only £800,000. In
February, 1962 a second prospectus was
issued, which sought to raise another
£62,500 in the form of equity capital
and £250,000 in the form of debentures.
Prior to the issue of this prospectus,
£700,000 of equity capital had been
placed in conjunction with the issue of
£2.5 million of debenture stock. The
second prospectus also indicated that a
bonus issue of shares in the ratio of one-
for-three would be made on all shares
issued, except the £350,000 which were
issued as a bonus prior to the original
public offering. The effect of all this
was to provide for the equity capital to
be raised to its present level of £2.2
million.
It is interesting to compare the
estimates made in the two prospectuses
with the position as at June 30 last:
(£'000)
First Second 1963-64
prospectus prospectus accounts
Equity 2000 2200 2200
Debenture 2500 3000 3275
Interest 200 251 248
Depreciation 72 60 78
Amortisation 36 37 41
Tax 233 212 nil
Earnings 349 317 73
Earning rate p.c. 17.5 14.4 3.3
These figures are remarkably con-
sistent so far as the estimates of income
are concerned. In fact, if it were not
for the reduced depreciation and amor-
tisation in the estimate of the second
prospectus, net profit before depreciation,
amortisation, interest and tax would only
differ by £2OOO. The main difference is
in the capital cost of the project. Even
here the increase would only appear to
be of the order of 10 p.c.—from approxi-
mately £4 million to £4.4 million.
From the 1963-64 accounts it would
seem that the cost of development, in-
cluding plant and equipment, was just
under £5 million. With the revaluation
of assets, total capital is now just over
£5.6 million. What we now have to
estimate is whether or not the profit
budget can be achieved so that the equity
capital will earn 14.4 p.c. or 8.64 pence
per share.
office block and shopping areas
A were completed in December, 1962.
It seems likely that the rentals received
from these sources were close to rep-
resenting a full year’s revenue in
1963-64. We have no precise informa-
tion on what proportion of total revenue
these rentals represent and no indication
at all as to the proportion of net profit
that they will contribute. On the other
hand, the hotel was only operating for
about eight out of the twelve months in
1963-64. Again, as we do not know what
proportion the hotel was expected to con-
tribute to the net profits, it is almost
impossible to make any judgment on
the basis of the 1963-64 profit and loss
account.
The interim report, covering the
period of six months to December 31,
1964, when all sections were fully
operating, states that the consolidated net
profit was £87,370. To this figure would
need to be added an amount of £18,885,
which had been deducted and rep-
resented a loss on the disposal of plant.
If a full half year’s interest was paid,
it would seem that net profit before
interest, depreciation, amortisation and
tax for the half-year amounted to
£408,000. While it is possible that the
second half of the year may not be as
profitable as the first half, there is every
reason to believe that this figure for the
whole year will be of the order of
£BOO,OOO, or only 8i p.c. less than the
prospectus estimate. This must be
regarded as a very creditable perform-
ance in view of the increases that have
occurred in wage costs alone since the
estimates were prepared.
However, mainly as a result of higher
charges for interest, depreciation and
amortisation, it also seems likely that
earnings may not exceed £225,000. This
would give an earning rate of 10.2 p.c.
or 6.12 pence per share. Provided the
forecast dividend rate of 6 p.c. is paid,
the shares at current prices of 4s. 2d.
show an earning yield of 12.3 p.c. and
a dividend yield of 7.2 p.c.
In the original prospectus it was
stated: “In view of the long-term lease-
hold, practically all the profits earned
will be available for payment of divi-
dends and it will be the policy of the
directors to pay dividends half-yearly to
the full extent practicable.” It could be
that, if the earning rate is as high as 10
p.c., the directors may consider that a
higher payout ratio than 60 p.c. would be
in order. In this event the shares would
seem to be worth rather more than
4s. 2d.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Slowly But Surely Growing
Australian Gypsum for the long term
rpHE Australian Gypsum Industries Ltd
~ group is the principal producer of
gypsum (used in the manufacture of
plaster, as well as for other purposes)
and plaster in the eastern States. Opera-
tions are conducted through 23 “princi-
pal trading” subsidiaries and J. 3 “other”
subsidiaries in all States with the excep-
tion of WA. Plaster mills are operating
in Auckland and Christchurch, too, ful-
filling most of the needs on the North
and South Islands of NZ.
The holding and now listed company
was formed in October, 1960. Prior to
this, the group consisted of Australian
Gypsum Products Pty Ltd and its sub-
sidiaries, whose figures have been used
in 1959-60 column of the accompanying
table and are not strictly comparable
on many counts with the latter years.
All the shares in this private company
were owned by the Australian Gypsum
Ltd, the Victor Electric Plaster Mills
Ltd, and the Peninsula Plaster Co. Ltd.
The present holding company was
formed to amalgamate these three and
to buy out their interests in the group.
Among other things this involved the
issue of £2,625,000 in ss. shares. With
this capital, plus another £250,000, the
company was listed.
The three former owners of the group
were liquidated and their assets realised.
To all intents and purposes they had
merely formed themselves into one hold-
ing company for the group, increasing
capital at the same time. The effect of
this is well marked on earning rates,
which took a sharp drop in 1960-61,
the first year for the rearranged group.
On this count at least, the new set-up
has not necessarily proved to be in the
best interests of the group and its share-
holders, as the directors said it would
be when the plans were put into action.
The extra £250,000 listed as capital
when the company floated came from
an allotment of shares to British Plaster
Boards (Holdings) Ltd of UK. An
agreement provided for the free ex-
change of information on research and
development between the two, and
allowed for the use of patents. The
association has proved to be of great
value to the Australian group ever since.
BPB is the largest producer of gypsum
and plaster products in UK and has
subsidiaries or associate companies in
Canada, South Africa, Southern Rho-
desia, Eire, Sweden, Belgium, Italy and
France. Since listing, AGI has estab-
lished a similar association with the
United States Gypsum Co. as well.
Plain gypsum and plaster products are
not the group’s only production items:
“Bellco” school chalk, fibrous plaster
products plus a range of electrical and
metal goods also come into the picture.
Insulwool, the home insulation material,
has proved successful too. This particu-
lar subsidiary also has a lagging divi-
sion and turns out a range of acoustical
products for all types of buildings.
It will be apparent by now that the
group is geared primarily, in fact almost
solely, to the building industry, the rate
of erection for new homes and flats
being the section of the industry which
is most important. One of the best-
selling lines has been the Victor plaster
board. In 1963-64, the factory at Oak-
leigh (Vic.) operated at near full capa-

city for the whole year. Demand is
still growing, so additional plants have
been or are being constructed.
Apart from supplying gypsum to the
local market, export is also undertaken.
Deliveries to the Far East from Theven-
ard (SA) rose again last year. The
future growth of this side of the busi-
ness is likely to be hampered by In-
creases in overseas shipping freights and
the higher wages now payable locally—
quite a burden in such a competitive
market.
The company chairman, Mr Raymont
Moore, is probably as good as anyone in
summing up the future prospects of the
group and the building industry. In
the 1963-64 balance sheet he said: “In
view of the buoyant state of the Austra-
lian economy, it would appear that a
flow of finance will continue to be avail-
able to provide for the increasing de-
mand for homes and flats required to
accommodate our growing population.
Your directors therefore anticipate that
the demand for the products of the group
should continue at a high level in the
current financial year.”
Of course the extremely unusual facet
of the company is the fact that its ss.
shares are so steady and so high, despite
the reliance on the building industry.
Its position of leadership no doubt has
a lot to do with this. But it cannot be
disputed that it is extremely rare for any
company of this nature to see its shares
holding so steadily.
The steady financial history illustrated
in the table is just as unusual to build-
ing industry companies as the relatively
steady nature of the shares. Working
capital is healthy and continually im-
proving. Fixed assets have remained
steady, only depreciation knocking them
gradually back. Investments have risen
slowly too, while intangible assets have
hardly moved at all.
Profit and earning rate growth has
been slow but sure overall, the deadly
1961-62 year taking only a minor toll.
The share price trend has been generally
up.
Directors have just lifted the interim
dividend from 5 to 61 p.c., thus sup-
porting the full 121 p.c. rate suggested
by last year’s final payment. Their
interim report mentioned an improve-
ment on results for the corresponding
December period of 1963-64.
In summing up, it should be empha-
sised that the shares are best bought
with the long term in view, although
there are probably better buys on the
market if one is inclined in that direc-
tion. The chances are there for cash
or bonus issues, but neither would be
very big. Not much could be made in
capital gains anyway, as the shares are
likely to drop heavily once such an issue
is made, because many investors are
already expecting such a move.
RAYNORS HOLDINGS LTD
Wide Industrial Tie-ups
I>aynors Holdings Ltd, the self-styled
jeweller to industry, has certainly
proved a sound investment for investors
who were fortunate enough to get in on
the original float in 1957.
At that time, certain shareholders
placed half of the £165,000 paid capital
of ss. ordinary shares with the public
at ss. 9d. plus charges, in order to obtain
a sufficiently wide spread of shares to
qualify for stock exchange listing.
However, the company’s history goes
back to 1898 when the business began in
the general engraving field. Prior to the
Second World War, activity was confined
mainly to the metal engraving field. Fol-
lowing construction of a new factory in
1955 the company expanded its activities.
Today it manufactures a wide range
of metal pressings, diecastings, plastic
mouldings and engraved components for
the automotive, domestic appliance, elec-
tronic and engineering industries. The
company is one of the largest producers

Because of its tie-up with a wide
range of industry, the company has been
able to avoid most of the setbacks in-
curred by specialist operators. Never-
theless, the 1960 credit squeeze saw a
25 p.c. decline in earnings. However,
the £45,352 profit, equal to 12.6 p.c. on
capital, still gave a reasonable cover to
the 10 p.c. dividend paid since flotation.
Since this reverse, earnings have con-
tinued to rise. Appearances are that
profit for the current year will be a
record.
Shareholders have had several oppor-
tunities to participate in cash issues, with
a one-for-one issue at par in 1959 and
a two-for-five at a 2s. premium which
has just finished (April 2).
Paid ordinary capital is now £515,729.
In addition there is £42,500 in preference
shares held by the AMP, redeemable at
the annual rate of £2500.
Profit last year was £79,705, equal to
20.7 p.c. after meeting preference charges
of £3600. Because of “the incidence ot
higher living costs” dividend was lifted
to 11 p.c.
The accounts for 1964 showed greatly
reduced liquidity. Bank overdraft was
up from £71,115 to £178,641, while
additional long-term funds were obtained
from the AMP, lifting this debt from
£89,800 to £140,000.
Much of these borrowed funds were
channelled into stock, up from £142,909
to £216,652, because of increased
demand. Fixed assets rose from
£575,528 to £685,149, made up of
£313,038 in freehold and the remainder
in plant.
It came as no surprise when the com-
pany made the new issue announcement.
The reserve position of the company
is strong, with net assets backing of each
ss. share standing at 7s. sd.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Dangers of Making an Issue
Some promising shares hit hard
A lthough the market has been reason-
ably steady for the last few weeks,
the 50-point fall earlier in the year still
dominates any thoughts about buying
and selling.
Taking general toll of the situation,
the shares that have been hit hardest are
those which have had or are having
issues. ISAS (NSW) has certainly left
its mark on the portfolio. Faring even
worse have been such sound companies
as PGH Industries and more lately
R. and N. Statham.
The blows have not only been con-
fined to cash issues. Only the other
day, Minster went ex a l-for-3 bonus
issue. Just prior to that day the shares
had been selling at 101 s., thus giving an
ex bonus price -of almost 765. Alas,
after the issue, the market tffought other-
wise because the price since has been
very much closer to 665. It’s beyond
logic, because Minster’s already impres-
sive record should be highlighted by the
current year’s performance. One glance
at floorcoverings statistics will verify this
statement.
Of similar stature is W. R. Carpenter.
It also has made 1965 a bonus year.
In Carpenter’s case, a l-for-5 bonus issue
takes place on March 31. If the Minster
issue is going to prove any guide, then
1 should be selling any W. R. Carpenter
now and buying back after the issue. The
one snag is that I haven’t got any. So
I have to turn once again to that un-
pleasant practice of shorting. I sold 250
W. R. Carpenter shares for 335. 3d.
The underlying principle in most
transactions for the short-term trader,
and indeed for any investor, is price.
So much so that often the investor should
divorce himself completely from the
market status of the company. And how
well that has been demonstrated in the
last few months. W. R. Carpenter is
as good an example as ever and so also
is the other company shorted this week,
Mount Isa.
After almost hitting 305., the shares
have bounced up to the 355. mark again.
Mr Mackie is still championing the
cause of "Break Australian Industry”.
By shorting at 355., I’m expecting to see
the price in the low 30s. again.
Despite all this shorting, that middle
course of action set down last week has
been carried forward. The company
receiving the buying honor this week was
Macquarie Worsted.
Worsted textile manufacturing has
never appealed to the average investor,
for the very good reason that very few
companies in the industry consistently
make profits. In the 1950 s Macquarie
Worsted’s patchy record fitted into this
pattern. Then came the substantial loss
in 1961.
Macquarie thus appeared the classic
example of an investment to be avoided.
But how much better one would have
fared by putting all one’s money into
Macquarie Worsted, at this stage, rather
than spreading it between BHP, ACI
and CSR!
This 1961 year proved the turning
point for the company. Since then, profits
have increased year by year and dividend
rate has been raised to 9 p.c. A glance
at developments over the last few years
shows a complete reorganisation of pro-
duction, culminating in the employment
of 16 Sulzer weaving machines in the
Orange factory in 1963. These weaving
machines are very much more efficient
than the manual weaving methods used
by other Australian worsted manu-
facturers and have placed the company
in a distinctly favorable position with
its competitors.
So, with the shares under par again
and an interim report coming up shortly,
they deserve a place in the portfolio.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Reducing Wheat Acreages
A reply to E. J. Donath
■pUfR E. J. Donath (The Bulletin,
March 13) has a good story and he
tells it well. Summarised, it is that Aus-
tralia is in danger of over - producing
wheat and that now is the time to call a
halt. Some 55,000 wheatgrowers have
this season produced a record 380 million
bushels. When the next harvest is
delivered, around Christmas time, there
will be “probably 100 million bushels
unsold”.
Mr Donath, allowing for the updating
of figures, has been telling his story now
for three years. All that has happened,
each time, is that wheatgrowers have sold
more wheat and collected more money.
This time Mr Donath may be proved
right. But that is something which no
one in the whole wide world knows for
sure. Mr Donath doesn’t, the wheat-
grower and the Wheat Board don’t, and
this writer doesn’t, either.
Mr Donath's credentials are not under
scrutiny. He is Lecturer in Marketing
of Rural Products at the Australian In-
stitute of Export and at Melbourne Uni-
versity. Previously he was Lecturer in
Geography at the university.
What needs to be said, here, is that
there is another side to the story. This
needs to be told, also.
The first item is from a survey pre-
pared by the United Nations Economic
Survey for Asia and the Far East
(ECAFE). The survey shows that 1800
million of the world's 3000 million people
have less now to eat than 25 years ago.
Half the w-orld goes hungry. It’s not
simply a slogan. It’s a fact—according
to ECAFE, anyway. A large proportion
of this hungry half lives in Asia.
The survey suggests —and this is the
important part when considering the
wheat acreage question in Australia —•
that “unless Asian countries can increase
their food production, their net import
of grain in 1970 might have to be
increased to 18 million tons a year or
three times the level of the early ’sixties”.
The chances of Asian countries, and
China in particular, increasing food pro-
duction sufficiently to eliminate the need
for grain imports is remote.
Let’s not get carried away by this.
There’s still the problem of selling wheat
at a price which suits us and which suits
the buyer. We know that both Canada
and the United States have reduced
wheat prices and that the EEC countries
are aiming at self-sufficiency by 1970.
Nevertheless, the market for wheat seems
to be there all right.
Assuming, though, that Mr Donath
may be right, and that there will be
difficulty in selling our wheat, how would
acreages be restricted in Australia? It is
difficult to see how it could be done
short of a Government order. This would
require the sort of powers which, in the
past, have existed only in war-time. To do
it now would require special legislation
and it is doubtful if the Australian public,
generally, would stand for it.
Wheatgrowers would certainly fight
any such move, tooth and nail. The
wheatgrowers’ opinion has been neatly
summed up by Mr A. R. Johnston,
general secretary of the United Farmers
and Woolgrowers’ Association of NSW.
He said: “If acreage restrictions were
introduced we could simultaneously be
confronted with a bad season and find
ourselves unable to supply even our
traditional markets. It is only seven years
since it was necessary to ask the United
Kingdom to take less wheat than her
quota and, in fact, Canadian wheat was
imported into New South Wales”.
Mr Johnston also countered the often-
expressed view (not strictly correct) that
“the taxpayer subsidises the wheat-
grower”. He argued: “If world wheat
prices exceed the cost of production the
growers pay in the difference up to
Is. 6d. a bushel. When overseas sales
are below cost, any growers’ money in
the fund is used first. Then the Govern-
ment must make up the difference, but
only in respect of 150 million bushels
exported. Furthermore, the growers are


obliged to provide some 60 million
bushels for the Australian community at
the bare production cost with no profit,
and to maintain this in their own storages
and at their own expense until required.”
This is a vital point and one frequently
misunderstood. Australian wheat is not
Government-owned or subsidised wheat
in the American sense.
There’s another point, equally vital.
The wheat industry, as with all Aus-
tralian primary industry, is bedevilled
by rising costs of manufactured items
used in farming—wire, machinery, steel,
fuels, and so on. Admitting that
economists can sometimes fly the flag
for their favorite football team, it never-
theless can be argued that tariff pro-
tection of Australian secondary industries
can cost as much as £3OO million a year
to the community at large. It is true
that without these industries half the
community would be out of jobs, yet it’s
still a point.
Now if the worst happens and there
is a carryover of 100 million bushels (by
no means a certainty), then the Govern-
ment contribution to the Wheat Stabilisa-
tion Fund would come to around £li
million. It is not comparable with the
kind of price supports and farm sub-
sidies which exist in the United States
and the United Kingdom, though we
should by no means dismiss the idea that
we may one day get ourselves into a
subsidies straitjacket. It needs watching,
though it’s not just around the corner.
In any case the wheatgrower can claim
that he has subsidised the Australian tax-
payer. That may sound paradoxical but
it can be argued this way. Since 1946
Australian growers could, without the
stabilisation plan, have sold wheat in
many years at far above the local price.
The local price, remember, is cost of
production.
According to Mr Johnston of the
United Farmers these sales overseas,
which did not take place because the
wheat had to be held for the local market,
would have amounted to £203 million.
It's complex and confusing but it does
add up to another side of the story.
Then there is the matter of principle.
This has been stated concisely by Sir
Samuel Wadham.
He has written: “The maximum of
freedom for the individual is considered
to be the basis of our national structure.
It is true that individual liberty can
never be complete in a modern com-
munity with its complicated system of
living in which many acts of an individual
must interfere with the welfare of others.
We therefore accept restraints in many
matters such as the way in which we use
the roads, or dispose of waste materials
to take two instances.
“But apart from various restrictions
of these types the individual has the right
to own property and decide a great many
matters for himself. The farmer can do
what he likes with his land provided he
does not waste it by allowing erosion
and does not carry on practices which
interfere with the welfare of his neigh-
bors. If we have the land and the know-
ledge of how to produce raw materials
from it effectively it is our job to do so,
so long as the welfare of our producers
is not jeopardised.”
Sir Samuel has pointed out something
which is basic in this argument and
which most observers conveniently over-
look. Australia is an important wheat
producer but is exceeded by the US,
Canada, France, and even two countries
where we have sold wheat in recent
years Russia and China. If we do
have a carryover of 100 million bushels,
this would be a small proportion of the
world trade in grain.
Sir Samuel believes, with most wheat-
growers, that we do need greater storage
capacity. This can be argued against, of
course, on the grounds of expense. But
if more country storage is to be built,
it is worth remembering that this will
be built from materials supplied by Aus-
tralian (tariff protected) secondary in-
dustries.
China is the key to the situation.
What do the Chinese think? No one
knows that really, either. Maybe they
are out to reduce us to penury. Maybe
not. How would anyone really know?
While the Wheat Board chairman, Mr
J. V. Moroney, who has negotiated the
sales to China, never reveals exactly
what the gentlemen from Peking say to
him, it is possible to glean the general
tenor of it. (Other men have been to
China, too, and naturally they talk to
their friends about it when they come
back.) Said one such man (a wheat-
grower) to this writer: “It’s simple. They
would rather buy wheat from us cheap
and sell their own edible oils and fruits
dear to Japan and other outlets in Asia.
That way they build up funds to buy
the machinery and scientific equipment
they need.”
It may not be as simple as that.
Probably it is not. Yet it’s still another
indication that there are two sides to the
question of whether or not wheat acre-
ages should be restricted in Australia.
Free to Test Tractors
New life for the Werribee station
HThe tractor testing station at Werribee,
A Victoria, has been in existence for
eleven years. It has cost about £BOOO
a year to maintain. It has tested only
fourteen tractors of five different makes
in all that time a sorry record.
Now it looks as if the station may
at last be on the way to providing a
better service for the farmer.
Twice in recent years the station
looked like going on the rocks. The

“We've been forced to take over the oil companies
for their own safety ."

up of the Department of Primary In-
dustry plus the Departments of Agri-
culture of the various States was
naturally doubtful of its value. Fourteen
tractors tested at a cost, approximately,
of £BO,OOO. Not so good.
The station, administered by Mel-
bourne University, claimed that the
tractor manufacturers would not play
ball. The manufacturers, said the station
authorities, insisted on supplying “show
pony” tractors, special jobs prepared for
a test and not the sort the farmer could
buy.
The manufacturers countered this by
accusing the station of being unrealistic.
The farmer, when he got a new tractor,
always had it properly serviced and
tuned before he used it. There was just
no such thing as a “random sample”
tractor.
The wrangle went on for a long time.
Late last year the station, supported by
the National Farmers’ Union, put up an
idea that it buy tractors off the floor of
the showrooms and test them with or
without the manufacturers’ consent. The
Agricultural Council granted an extra
£4OOO to enable this “buy and test” plan
to operate. Then, suddenly, the tractor
manufacturers announced that they
would supply stock model tractors for
testing on the “random” selection basis.
What caused the tractor manufacturers
to change their tune after all those years
of opposition to the random selection
system? There are two theories and you
can take your pick. You can ask the
tractor manufacturers if you like, but
you will not get a clear answer.
The first theory is that the manu-
facturers feared the “buy and test” idea
and were beaten, so to speak, into sub-
mission. The second theory is bound up
in a survey the manufacturers made
throughout Australia. It was a big
survey and it must have cost quite a bit.
The finding: farmers, generally, are not
interested in test reports on tractors from
any sourcer despite claims to the con-
trary. This is partly because of the
opportunity to test the tractor on the
farm before purchase. It is also partly
due to things such as the personality and
popularity of the local dealer, avail-
ability of service and spares, loyalty of
farmers to certain models, price, and the
suitability (discovered by experience) of
certain makes to certain terrain.
But whatever the reason, the station
now has a chance to prove its case (no
pun intended). The fact that it does do
some other work connected with tractors
and implements does not alter the fact
that it was created as a tractor testing
station. All it has to do now is to test
tractor and, perhaps more of a chal-
lenge, get the results of its tests across
to farmers in language they can under-
stand.
