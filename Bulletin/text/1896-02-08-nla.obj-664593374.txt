Malay Sketch es.
At Perak, on the eastern side of the Malay
Peninsula, a British Resident upholds the
British protectorate. He is Frank Athel-
stane Swettenham, an officer of the French
Academy, who Ims collected in a very
interesting book (6s. 6d.) the fruits of 20
years’ observation of Malay character.
Mr. Swettenham’s style is studiously simple,
and even his descriptions of the gorgeous
Malay scenery are chastened as far as may
be. He writes always lucidly, agreeably,
and convincingly.
*,«,.* * *
Mr. Swettenham’s predecessor in office
w r as murdered by his Malay proteges, and
Mr. [Swettenham narrowly escaped the same
fate at the same time. Since then, manners
have softened somewhat. \ r et at any time
the Malay thinks little of shedding blood.
“ He is intolerant of insult or slight ; it is
something that to him should be wiped out
in blood. He will brood over a real or
fancied stain on his honor until he is
possessed by the desire for revenge. If he
cannot wreak it on the offender, he will
strike out at the first human being that
comes ip his way, male or female, old or
young. It is this state of blind fury, this
vision of blood, that produces the amok -
the only effect of the Malay character which
has made an abiding impression on the
Western mind.
* * * *
“The real Malay is a short, thick-set,
well-built man, with straight black hair, a
dark brown complexion, thick nose and lips,
and bright intelligent eyes. His disposition
is generally kindly, his manners are polite
and easy. Never cringing, lie is reserved
with strangers and suspicious, though he
does not show it. . . Christian mission-
aries of all denominations have apparently
abandoned the hope of his conversion. In
his youth, the Malay boy is often beautiful,
a tiling of wonderful eyes, eyelashes, and
eyebrows, with a far-away expression of sad-
ness and solemnity, as though he had left
some better place for a compulsory exile on
earth. Those eyes, which are extraordin-
arily large and clear, seem filled with a
pained wonder at all they see here, and they
give the impression of a constant effort to
open ever wider and wider in search of some-
thing they never find. Unlike the child of
Japan, this cherub never looks as if his nurse
had forgotten to wipe his nose.”
* * • »
Mr. Swettenliam’s book is not only enter-
taining, it tells of things of which the world
far away from Perak knows little or nothing.
Take the chapter on “ Latah.” Latah is an
extraordinary disease—using the word for
want of a better—which in its most striking
manifestations seems peculiar to the Malay
family. The person who is latah is in a
constitutional state of impressibility—a per-
petual hypnotic subject—responding at once
to the least sign or suggestion from anyone
who chooses to influence him. There is no
outward sign of this strange inward state.
Of two latah persons who were members of
his corps of native police, Mr. Swettenham
says :
Speaking generally, it was only necessary for
any one to attract the attention of either of these
men by the simplest means, holding up a finger,
calling them by name in a rather pointed way,
touching them, or even, whep close by, to look
them hard in the face, and instantly they ap-
peared to lose all control of themselves and would
do, not only whatever they were told to do, but
whatever was suggested by a sign.
The latah man or woman who is suddenly
startled will usually fire off a volley of
expressions more or less obscene, having no
reference at all to the circumstance which
has aroused attention. This applies to women
especially ; and a comparison with the
language used by some subjects under
anaesthetics suggests that the cerebral condi-
tion of the latah person and the ansesthised
person is similar.
* * * *
A chapter recounting the curious dream of
a Malay woman is particularly interesting.
This woman was sleeping in a hut built on
piles forced into the mud at the mouth of a
river on the Perak coast. Her husband
woke and missed her ; search was made;
and she was found about half-a-mile away,
near the sea-edge, struggling with/Hireef
crocodiles from 6ft. to Bft. long, Vno were
worrying her. When she was brought back,
she said that in a dream two radiant beings
appeared and bid her follow them, which
she did .until awakened by feeling the teeth
of a crocodile in her leg. And this was
curious : while the searchers sunk deep into
the mud at every step, the woman had never
sunk in at all. When found, there was only
mud on the soles of her feet, and, though
she had walked lialf-a-mile across the flat,
and her tracks were plainly visible in the
moonlight, they were all on the surface, and
she had crossed the soft, unstable mire as
easily as though it had been a metalled road.
* * * *
Then Mr. Swettenham comments :
The ideal woman, the product of higher educa-
tion and deep research in divers subjects, supplies
the real clue to the phenomenon, for, when asked
“where the true spirit of Cod is,” she modestly
replies, “ I can tell you : it is in us women. We
have preserved it and handed it down from one
generation to another of our own sex unsullied.”
(“ The Heavenly Twins,” book iii., chap, iii.)
Doubtless—from the time when the Spirit moved
upon the face of the waters, and, later, on the Sea
of Galilee ; but it is more difficult to understand
how woman, unaided, has handed anything down
from one generation to another.
The same idea is, however, more happily con-
veyed in the injunction of the President of the
Scraggsville Woman’s Suffrage League to her
husband, when ordering him to go and purchase a
divided skirt. “If you are afraid, pray to God
for courage ; She will help you. ”
The mere male has his uses, one of which is to
assist the unsullied sex to perpetuate the Spirit of
God, and another to be within hail when there
are crocodiles about.
Religious purists might think this passage
irreverent, but probably it is only tinged
with a reflection of the candour of the Malay
mind. For example : many years ago a
Christian missionary came to Malaya full of
zeal and confident of success. He began
with a man who seemed an earnest, truthful
person, anxious to Ipm, a promising sub-
ject. The missionary told him tire story of
the Immaculate Conception. The Malay
listened to the end, showing great interest
in the miraculous narrative of the Blessed
Virgin ; then lie said, “ If that had happened
to my wife, I should have killed her.”
* * * *
Mr. Swettenham closes his book with a
striking picture of evening in Malaya. . “If
night treads closely on the heels of day,
there is no need for regret. The darkness is
but for a moment, and over the eastern
peaks spreads a sheen, herald of that
great orb of splendor which, rising rapidly,
clears the mountain- and sheds:, a flood of
wonderful, indescribable, mellow radiance
over forest, plain and sea, softening what is
crude, pointing: with brilliance the most
striking features, and casting intci a’ fathom-
less shadow the dark valleys of the western
slopes. There is nothing gold about this
Eastern moon. Seen, half-risen, against the
dark foliage of the mountain, it glitters like
molten silver, dazzling the eyes, and as it
soars serenely upward seems the very per-
fection of beauty, light and purity. Strange
that the delight and glory of mankind since
ever the earth was peopled, the emblem of
unattainable longing, should be a gigantic
cinder. ”

A writer in the National Review gives
statistics showing that between 1833 and
1894 the number of London drunkards
decreased from 1 in 40 to 1 in 216 of popula-
tion ; while between 1831 and 1891 the
number of British publicans decreased from
4V to 2 3 per 1000 of population. Yet now,
as Herbert Spencer points out, when volun-
tary efforts and more general causes have
produced comparative Sobriety, the clamor
for abolition of the drink traffic is greater
than ever.
Kipling’s Scotch-engineer “ghost” has
helped him to an ingenious tale for Dec.

Yet, in spite of the cleverness of idea
and execution, such a catalogue of techni-
calities is more admirable than interesting.
The Minster is to start a marvellous new
uncliurchy series, and every annual sub-
scriber is to get, in addition to his paper, a
parcel of new books valued at 255., an
accident insurance policy, a reduction of
from 10 to 15 per cent, in bis travel hotel-
bills, advice free by letter on all subjects,
and free execution of London commissions—
all for 12s. per annum.
Notes.
Cosmos for January (Bd.) is a particularly
readable and interesting number, from an
article on Judge Windeyer without the
Mount Rennie case to a paper on Austra-
lian school-children’s blunders. A teacher
who notes all the quaint imaginations of the
little flock may make many such an enter-
taining budget in the course of a work-time.
The Halstead Gazette (Essex, Eng.) of
Dec. 5 steals Alex. Montgomery's clever
sketch, “In Divorce,” which appeared in
The Bulletin of Oct. 19 last, hacks it
brutally, and utterly spoils it. This journal
wishes the British thief-paper would at least
refrain from murdering the imaginative
children which it kidnaps.
Stead’s Penny Novel Series —commencing
with “She”—should win public patronage.
The Australian demand for the Penny Poets
has fallen off considerably many firms
which ordered the first numbers in hundreds
being ndw content with tens and units. The
later numbers —particularly the “ Arnold
have not come up to scratch, and the intro-
ductions gi’ow heavy.
In frowned-upon “Jude the Obscure,’
Thomas Hardy sends ~his heroine to Sydney,
where she commits bigamy with “ a gentle-
man who manages a Sydney hotel.” When
she returns to England and the obscure
person refers to her “crime,” —“ Crime !
she says, “Pooh ! They don’t think much
of such as that over there ! Lots of ’em do
it.” The celebrated British author’s infor-
mation about Australia is invariably reliable
and entertaining.
An English publisher issues a “ Crimin-
ology Series,” and his first two 1) >oks are
transitions of Italian- authors. Ferri’s
“ Criminal Sociology ” (6s. 9d.), just issued,
gives to the English public the best of a book
not new, but extremely valuable. As Lom-
broso is the scientist of crime, so Ferri is its
philosopher. He reasons well, and his main
conclusions are unassailable. The points of
interest in his work are very numerous : its
chief object is to apply to the criminal the
scientific laav of necessity, and, to show that
he, as all else, is at once cause and effect,
the helpless offspring of social conditions
and an active influence upon them. The
ancient copy-book adage said that “ the fear
of God is the beginning of wisdom. ” In any
natural sense, the words have for a modern
mind no meaning. Nowadays, for the fear
of God, we read the reverence of law ; and
when once a man has comprehended in what
a mighty chain of events he forms the shred
of an insignificant link, then to him has
arrived a beginning of knowledge of the
springs which should animate his actions and
relationships. Then, as Garofalo, another
criminologist, declares, he will discard the
old idea that criminal science has only
two terms, crime and punishment, and will
recognise and deal with three, the crime, the
criminal, and the means best calculated for
social self-defence. That is, the notion of
“punishment ” will be eliminated altogether.

Cheiro : The Arena verse, “If we only
knew,” is but a re-dressing of old saws and
sentiments. Even the form is borrowed
from Richard Burton’s “If we had the
time”- a much more poetical piece—here-
with :
IF WE HAD THE TIME.
If i had the time to find a place
And sit me down full face to face
With iny better self that stands no show
In my daily life tiiat rushes so ;
It misflit be then I would see my soul
Was stumbling-- st ill towards the shining goal;
I might be nerved by the thought sublime—
If I had the time !
If I had the time to let my heart
Speak out and take in my life a part,
To look about and to stretch a hand
To a comrade quartered in no-luck land.
Ah, God ! if I might but just sit still
And hear the note of the whippoorwill,
I think that my wish with God’s would rhyme—
If I had the time !
If I had the time to learn (from you
How much lor coinfort my word could do,
And 1 told you then of niy sudden will
To kiss your leet when I did you ill—
If the tears aback of the bravado
Could force their way and let you know—
Brothers, the souls of us all would chime—
If we had the time !
The Arena editor, B. O. Flower, is the
American Stead, and his magazine is chiefly
given over to the sinister inconsequences of
the shriek-female.

“ Songs and Sonnets of Springtime ” (1881,

philosophy, “ Induction and Deduction ”
(1890, 8s.); “ Further Reliques ” (1891, Bs.)
There is a memoir by W. R. Hughes (2s. 9d.)

Can only procure from Lond. Constance
Naden’s verse is readable, but lias no poeti-
cal value ; her philosophical writings include
some of the keenest and most luminous
thoughts anywhere to be met. Two or three
to taste :
Every man is his own universe. [This, of
course is only a crisper statement of the doctrine
of Protagoras : Man the criterion of existence, the
measure of all things].
The attempt to construct a machine which shall
never run down, and the attempt to deduce the
being of Cod from the idea of Cod, are equally
specimens of the fallacy that an infinite result may
be obtained by finite means.
It is our duty to be both healthy and happy,
for our fitness or unfitness will be transmitted to
future generations; and, besides, excessive un-
selfishness not only fosters selfishness directly, by
accustoming others to receive and expect undue
sacrifices ; but it also fosters selfishness indirectly,
by tending towards the non-survival of the unsel-
fish. A certain degree of egoism, then, is not
only justifiable, but actually imperative.
No child of the century can truly understand
himself or his age, or can solve the problems in
which he himself is a factor; if he could, he
would be a child not of this century, but all the
centuries.
Error is but refracted truth, and the manifold
colors of the spectrum blend into one white sun-
beam.
Dear Bulletin, —You evidently took but scant
trouble to discover whether my recently-published
political novel entitled “ A Visit to Blestland,”
was written with any particular object, and, if so,
what that object was. Had you deigned to bestow
the most moderate attention on the book you
could hardly have failed to see that it endeavours
to deal with a problem the solution of which is of
the very deepest interest to humanity. The argu-
ment on which it is based is that it is useless to
hope for the ■ equitable removal of the many crying
evils and injustices which spring from the unequal
distribution of wealth so long as there is no legal
limit to the return which it is possible to receive for
he use of capital, whether it be invested as a loan or
in any direction which implies the employment of
human labor for profit-making purposes. I could
understand a work embodying these principles
being carped at by the press organs that represent
e privileged classes ; but to have it flouted by
your democratic weekly came as a genuine sur-
prise.—W. H. Galieii.
[lt wasn t your doctrine that was carped at,
though that is open to many carps : it was your
ponderous dullness. You don’t know the
hrst lines of your literary catechism. “Q. :

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I be -ante,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney."
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied.to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Taimvorth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
feet.ly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

IT MAY BE SELDOM
That Medical Advertisements can be relied on, but we here assert the following facts, which can be
borne out from Testimonials in our possession. Thousands may see this, and treat it as some
announcements deserve, but in this they would make a great mistake,
AND FOR THIS REASON :
by taking notice of what we have already done and can do, as proved by thousands of grateful
acknowledgments of our skill which we hold, it may Save Your Life and that of your dear ones.

Dr. Gibbons
Having completed his New and Centrallv-situated
Electrical & Consulting Rooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 EKzabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for ttie Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
D Ft. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.
Dr. GIBBONS has documentary evidence of
having thoroughly CURED Thousands of Cases
during the extended time he has practised as a
Specialist in Australia.

WHICH HAVE PAID AD VALOREM OR
OTHER OF THE REPEALED DUTIES,
WILL BE OFFERED AT REDUCED
PRICES, SO AS TO BRING THEM IN
TOUCH WITH THE NEW ORDER OF
THINGS.
The Amount of the Reductions
Is fixed by the amount of duty paid. All goods
on which TEN PER CENT, has been paid will
be reduced TEN PER CENT., while goods
bearing FIFTEEN PER CENT, duty will be
reduced FIFTEEN PER CENT. This is an
edict, from which no manner of departure will be

The Thoroughness of the

Cannot be questioned. When the whole of the
re-marking is done, every article will show on its

and the NEW PRICE at which the line is offered.
The Effect of the Reductions
Must be a great loss to ourselves. We desire to
be candid, and we repeat it will be a great lo ;s.
But we are not distressed at that. We owe the

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A STEAM-SONG.
When the shoulders of men refused to bear
The load of their gathered spoil,
Then they called me out of my home, the air,
To help in the victors’ toil.
And I came in a scalding shroud
At the kiss of the curling flame,
From sea and from lake, from river and cloud,
At the bidding of fire I came.
Through the changing blue of Pacific seas,
Where the palm-crowned atolls lie,
And the languid leaves of the tropic trees
Stands out to a hazy sky,
Where the frightened foam-flakes leap
From the touch of the turning screw,
Down the sun-track blazing before the ship
I ride with my Lascar crew.
On the bridge that hangs o’er the ravening firth
And over the crowded streets,
Through the tunnel that bores in the bones of earth
The pulse of my engine beats.
Where the anxious cities sleep,
Where the wind of the desert roars,
I hurry my freight over level and steep
From eastern to western shores.
Down the shaft where the yellow candle gleams
In the vapour-laden air,
And the earth leans hard on the red-gum beams—
I lower my diggers there ;
Till the drum, when the signal knocks,
Turns its waist to the rope again,
And I cast to the feet of the stampers the rocks
That pay for the lives of men.
When the grain is threshed from the ears of corn,
When the saw cuts into the stone ;
When out of the fleece the flannel is bom—
My power is seen and known.
When the roller flattens the gold
And the coin slides stamped from the dies,
When the girders sleep ’neath the palace they hold,
My wealth and my kingdom arise.
The pipe and the piston are but my thralls,
Though I bend my strength to their will ;
For the valve that spits by the whirling balls
Proclaims me a monarch still.
Should chance, or a hand untried,
Set a stop to my panting breath,
Then I fling the walls of my prison aside
And rush outward in ruin and death.
Though the shaft has might o’er the humming
wheels
Which the belting clasps and speeds,
’Tis the touch of my lips that the piston feels—
My voice that the valve-pipe heeds.
’Neath the riveted sheets I lurk
Pent-up in an iron throne—
Though the cogs and the cranks may do their
work,
The glory is all my own.

“Yes, I know it’s a mighty poor chance, but

And is this wish of love but will to live
A blind response to mandates of the race ?
Your charms, are they but baits to lure me give
An else refused tax to Time and Space ?
And all our interplay of lofty thought
Mere phosphor-lights on that illusion’s stream ?
Is strife the voice of Will, and, so,- the common
lot ?
And all the striving, trends it toward a dream ?
Your tenderness, self-sacrifice, and pure
Conceptions of the orbits duties keep,
Are they but mirages, woven to secure
More fools like us to will, and strive and weep ?
And, if we’d act the ordered part of right,
Nor but prolong our own and human woe,
We must deny this “ will to live,” and blight
With hermit chill our young blood’s lava-flow?
Nay, fetish Will o’ Wisp on swamps of thought
Will long have ceased to lure us or to fright,
Ere Love’s “ I love ” and Duty’s great “ I ought ”
Will fail to warm and steer us to the light.

With reference to Mr. Thomas Alva Ed!i-1
I son’s inventions, the inventor has (so Dal-

i statement:— |
I “It would require but the impetus of war
to develop such a flood of destructive appli-
ances as would astonish the world. There
is no need of a battle between two large |
armies in the field. A mere handiful of
men could sweep one of them away. The
power to do this is electricity. Water can
be made more deadly than bullets. I have
invented a machine by which it cam be
hurled to a great distance, and water
charged with 5000 volts and then dashed on
an army would sweep it away like chaff.

TO THE EDITOR.
Sir,—l notiee in your issue ol to-day that
the War Office in England suggests the for-
mation of volunteer reserves in the colonies.
The idea is a good one, and my object in
writing is for the purpose of giving prac-
tical effect to the suggestion.
| I venture to invite the volunteers, who,
I from 1854 to the present time have passed
i through the ranks, to call here and sign
I a requisition to the Mayor of Sydney, to
j convene a meeting at an early date of all
i ex-volunteers to organise and enroll a force
| of patriotic men; to form what is known in
Germany as the Landwehr, and thus show
the enemies cf England that we are willing
to, aid the old country by strengthening her
outside dependencies,
! Personally, as an old volunteer officer
and one of the earliest to enlist during the
/time of the Russian war of 1854-6, I still
feel able to shoulder a musket, and I think
on emergency >could bring do’wn my man.
'X am willing to; join the rank and file of the
proposed reserve for defence purposes.—

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1896.
The Cost of Provincialism.
Australian Federation has hitherto been
considered too exclusively in its vociferous or
after-dinner aspect, and too little from a
purely business standpoint, and this circum-
stance has done much to retard what should
have been a great and spontaneous national
movement. There has been abundance of
loose and staggery eloquence about the
“ destiny ” of United Australia, but a
destiny is not eatable nor drinkable nor
wearable, neither can it be pawned, and no
one knows exactly what it is, or if there
really is such a thing at all, or whether the
country might not be quite as well without
any. In any case, the average man is quite
willing to chance the destiny coming or stay-
ing away. Further, a great deal has been
said about “this great nation,” and to the
plain, backblocks person who is struggling to
grub out a huge gum-tree the great nation is
only an abstraction. Likewise the “flag”
has come in for a lot of enthusiasm, but the
average individual who looks only at the
outwardness of things sees nothing particular
in the flag save so much cloth at so much a
yard. Federation has become a question
to be slopped about loosely at banquets
amid the wine dregs and the crumbs ; and
to be orated upon by aldermen at the
opening of new bridges and dredges and
sand and mud-shifting contracts ; and to
be wildly glared at by unpractical bards of
an inferior order. But the advantages to be
realised in actual coin have been very little
dealt with, therefore the great mass of the
people remains uninterested. The Bulletin
has endeavored to explain some of these
advantages in previous articles, and it now
endeavors to explain some more of them on
a strictly .practical basis, and with no men-
tion of the flag or the national destiny or
any other of the abstract glories of the
situation.
* * * *
Australia is a vast, shapeless country with
few internal waterways, and these few, with
one exception, of little value, and one great
curse of its far-inland districts is the long
distances that lie between them and the
nearest seaport. The main supports of the
remote regions are the raising of wool and
meat for foreign markets ; and, therefore,
these great distances mean a heavy loss to
the producer and a serious handicap to the
industry generally, and a ruinous deprecia-
tion of the value of the regions in question.
But the loss has been made much heavier
than it need be by the unscientific manner in
which the provinces were carved out, and the
fact that railways have been constructed by
each province strictly in its own interests
rather than in those of Australia generally.
Each province began rail way building from its
own principal seaport, and its object has
invariably been to furnish its back districts
with an outlet, not to the nearest port, but
to the nearest port within its own boun-
daries. This policy was the necessary and
unavoidable result of the provincial system,
and will continue as long as the provin-
cial system lasts. The evil results of too
much separation have hardly been felt in
the coastal districts where the bulk of the
inhabitants are located, therefore, they have
attracted little attention ; but separatism has
done a vast amount of harm in the interior,
which has been sacrificed to the interests and
the parochial vanity of the bloated cities
along the seaboard.
* * * *
In the south-west of Queensland lies a
great region where roads are few and rail-
ways absolutely none. Part of it has an
outlet by one or two hundred miles of
bullock-dray conveyance and 500 miles of
rail to Brisbane, from which port its wool
and other produce are exported to Europe.
Another part has an outlet by one or two or
three hundred miles of execrable road and
420 miles of railway to the impracticable
Fitzroy River at Rockhampton. Most
of this country could find a much shorter
road to the sea at Port Augusta in South
Australia ; but, unfortunately, it was the
business of the provincial railway builders to
supply, not the shortest outlet, but the one
which would bring traffic to the Queensland
railways, and business to the Queensland
coastal towns, and freight to Queensland’s
subsidised line of mail steamers. Port
Augusta, in addition to being one or two
hundred miles nearer to south - western
Queensland by land, is 1400 miles nearer to
the European market by sea, and both
in the matter of exports and imports it
would be vastly cheaper, but the provin-
cial system enacts that produce must
be needlessly hawked half-way round the
continent in the interests of the Queensland
seaports in general, and Brisbane in par-
ticular. South Australia cannot build rail-
ways into south-western Queensland to con-
nect it with the south coast, for that district
is off her provincial beat, and Queensland
won’t construct lines which would carry
traffic into the adjacent territory, and, in
any case, the border tariff stops the way in a
great measure, as it does almost everywhere
else in Australia.
* * * *
The wastefulness of provincialism exhibits
itself in an exactly similar fashion in the
western parts of New South Wales. The
natural road to the sea for all the country west
of the Darling and Paroo is either by rail to
Port Pirie, or Port Augusta, in S. Australia,
or down the Darling and Murray rivers to
the same province. Therefore, when railway-
building starts in this region it should be by
an extension of the S.A. line from Cockburn.
Wileannia is, roughly speaking, 300 miles
nearer to Adelaide than it is to Sydney,
and Port Augusta is nearer even than
Adelaide. The situation of Wentworth,
Menindie, and other towns is exactly
similar. Nevertheless, they belong, by acci-
dent, to the old§r province ; if they get rail-
way communication, it must be with Sydney,
which means the expenditure of more than
twice as much money as is necessary, a far
longer journey, higher fares and freights,
and an outlet 1000 miles further from
Europe. Also, because of the greater cost
of railway-building to this unnatural outlet
in the far East, the districts beyond the
Darling must wait years more than is neces-
sary before a line can reach them, and their
progress is retarded thereby. The same
trouble crops up in many other localities.
The North-western districts of Victoria have
their most convenient outlet in South Aus-
tralia, but provincial exigencies demand that
their trade should be diverted by any possible
means to Melbourne, and an expensive rail-
way system is building with that end in
view. New South Wales has constructed a
long, costly line to bring to Sydney the trade
of the remote town of Hay and its surround-
ing districts, which, but for the provincial
system, could have found an outlet at Mel-
bourne at not much more than half the
distance ; and another expensive railway
carries the produce of the Jerilderie district
412 miles to the shores of Port Jackson, re-
gardless of the fact that Melbourne is only 205
miles away. Also the Moulamein district, on
the Edward River, is waiting anxiously for
a railway extension of 60 miles to join it to
Hay, so that it may have a connection, 514
miles long, witli Sydney, because the inte-
rests of the province do not permit of con-
structing 30 miles of line to connect with the
Victorian system at Swan Hill, and thus
making a road only 250 miles long to carry
the local trade by the cheapest route to
Hobson’s Bay !
♦ ♦ * *
The inhabitants of these outlying districts
pay, in extortionate fares and freights, and
consequent loss of trade and stagnation, for
this provincial spirit. Also, the inhabitants
of the country generally pay for it in interest
on a public debt, a considerable part of
which was incurred in building long, un-
necessary, unprofitable lines to carry tiade
where it never could go except at a
dead loss. In theory, railways are built
to carry the traffic of the province ; m
practice, they are built quite as often
to prevent someone else carrying l , anc
now that the lines are pushed out to the
remote borders of the Eastern provinces, the
danger of the trade going to the man next
door becomes more aggravated, and the neces-
sity for each province to spread out a net-
work of border lines to keep hold of its own
trade and grab at that of the adjacent terri-
tory becomes constantly greater. And, as
another consequence of this system, many
inland towns are left without railway com-
munication when they might be easily am
cheaply connected with the lines of the
next-door State, and when their means o
communication does arrive it will merely con-
sist of the privilege of paying freights for
500 miles of land-carriage when 250 would
suffice, and paying needless sea freights
round half a continent. When a Federal
Government and a Federal railway policy
are established, and provincial boundaries
are abolished, many far inland districts
which have been accustomed to regard them-
selves as hopelessly remote from railways
and seaports will suddenly find that they are
comparatively convenient and accessible
localities, and be much surprised thereat.

The eastern part of this continent has a
splendid water-way in the Murray and
Darling Rivers, which has also been ruined
to a great extent by interprovincial jealousies.
If the Darling were snagged and locked it
would afford cheap transit at all seasons to a
South Australian port for most of the wool
of western New South Wales, but it has
been left in its natural state chiefly to divert
the traffic to the long and expensive Bourke
and Cobar railroads. A proposal for its
improvement is now mooted, but it only
applies to the upper waters ; the idea is to
help the river traffic j ust so far as will facili-
tate the bringing of more goods to the rail-
road and no further. If the work were done on
a Federal and not a merely provincial basis,
a reliable mode of conveyance would be pro-
vided for many hundreds of miles of now
almost isolated country, but at present the
constant desire to divert trade to ‘ ‘ our ” ports,
and to prevent it going to the ports of the
man across the border, stands in the way.
Therefore, the lower reaches of the river will
probably be left in their present partially
unnavigable state to prevent trade going
down beyond the limits of the province if
possible. These are only a few out of many
samples of the results of the separatist
policy. The provincial system has already
cost Australia, in the public works depart-
ment alone, more millions than anyone would
care to reckon, and every year it is costing
other millions in useless railway haulage,
railway extensions to keep the trade ‘ ‘ in the
province,” wars of railway rates, and the
like. Yet even now the evil is only begin-
ning, and if it is allowed to go on for another
half-century the possible loss will be beyond
calculation. Altogether the provincial sys-
tem is a great deal more expensive than this
country can afford.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Appeal to D. Syme.
The Victorian Upper House has been even
more rampant than usual of late, and has thrown
out the progressive measures of the Turner
Government, one after another, with unfailing
regularity. It even almost went the length of
casting the Federation Bill overboard because
the members of the Convention were to be
elected by popular suffrage instead of nominated
by Parliament; it tore up the One-man-one-
vote Bill at first sight; also the Woman’s
Suffrage Bill, the Land-tax, and the Village
Settlements Bill, and it is now engaged Tu
destroying all the good features of several other
measures. Fhe situation of a Liberal Ministry
in is a weird affair. It can’t swamp
the Leg. Council with new nominees because
the institution isn’t a nominee Chamber. If its
measures are thrown out by the 48 Rich Land-
lords it can’t gain renewed strength by dis-
solving the Assembly and appealing to the
people as Premier Reid did in New' South
Wales, because the Council also rests on the
vote of the people—or a good many of them ■
and no vote of the Assembly has any influence
upon it. If the Government pushes progressive
measures through the Assembly it does so
knowing that the effort is mostly waste of time
and energy, as they will assuredly he
slaughtered in the “other place;” yet the
people having pul the Government into office
for the purpose of passing these measures, it
must put them through, so far as its
influence extends, and leave the rest to
luck or Providence. The situation is a
perpetual deadlock ; yet the people, who wake
up every now and then and complain bitterly
that the Government doesn’t “ do something ”
to squash this dreadful oligarchy, are mainly
responsible for the trouble. The Government
and the Assembly can do nothing to bring the
Council to reason ; the country, despite all the
disadvantages of the situation, could do a good
deal. Ihe \ lclorian Council consists of land-
ords only ; the qualification for membership
being the possession of an income of at least
£lOO a year from “ Proputty.” The nennlc
who Meet the 48 landlords must possess, as a
quahficauon, a freehold of the rateable value of
±.lO per amiuiii, or a leasehold of the rateable
value of £25 per annum. Certain exceptions
are made to this rule, but they are of verv
small importance, or no importance at all and
on the whole the Council is a body of’large
landholders elected by large, middle-sized, and
small landhoiders and leaseholders. But this
qualification, owing to the tolerably wide dis
tribution of property in Victoria, is more liberal
than it looks. * At last election there were
153,000 voters qualified to vote at Council
elections, and 229,000 qualified to vote at
Assembly elections ; that is to say, 153,000
persons could vote at both Council and Assembly
elections, and another 76,000 at Assembly elec-
tions only. At last dissolution of the Assembly
there was a great Liberal revival ; the polling
was heavy, and an enormous majority of those
who voted gave their support to the Turner
Ministry. If all these Ministerial supporters
who had votes for Council elections had
voted for Liberal candidates, or the most
liberal candidates they could find, at the
next Upper House election, there would
have been a serious upheaval among the fossils
and about a dozen of them would have gone
suddenly out of politics, and the Council would
have begun already to assume something of a
new aspect. But, as usual, hardly anybody
voted at all ; most of the ancient mariners got
back unopposed ; the public scarcely seemed to
be aware that there was an election in progress ;
and of the previous enthusiasm there was
hardly a sign. The great safeguard of the
Council’s fossildom is that that House is never
dissolved and never goes bodily before the
electors. One-third of the members, or there-
abouts, retire every two years. There is
seldom a general election in progress at the
time of their retirement, and the country is
only enthusiastic about politics at general elec-
tions. When about 16 of the fossils lapse
through effluxion of time it is almost always at
the dead season of the year when nobody is
looking, and the people take no interest in the
matter because even if they did oust the sixteen
and put advanced Liberals in their places there
would still be a Tory majority. It would take
two great uprisings of the people spread over
something more than two years to make a
reasonably democratic majority in the Council,
and the community can’t keep its enthusiasm
alight long enough. The best hope for the
reform of the Victorian Council would lie in the
establishment of a big political association,
which would get ready in advance a progressive
candidate—or the most progressive one which
the property qualification admitted of—forevery
Council seat, and stump the country furiously
in his interests when the election approached,
and drag the somnolent multitude to the polls
even against its will. Hitherto, all the
political organisation has been directed at the
Assembly, where the honorarium is, and where
organisation is much less wanted ; and unless
something of the kind is done on a large scale
with the 48 Rich Landlords these aged
zoophytes will probably go on being re-elected
without opposition till the crack of doom. If
the Democrats carried two elections and
secured even a transient majority, they could
make the Council a paid institution resting on
a manhood-suffrage basis, or otherwise reform it
as they pleased; the trouble is that no one seems
to care to make the great effort required/ Just
now the Age governs Victoria more absolutely
than any paper has ever governed an Austra-
lasian province before, and David Syme could
do more to run the needful crusade than any
other man in Victoria or out of it. Will
David Syme, for the good of his afflicted
country, undertake the contract ? The Bulle-
tin sees in its mind’s eye a brass-plate on the
Age’s front door with the inscription : “D.
Syme. Saviour of his Country. Ministries
Constructed while you Wait. Upper Houses
removed at the Shortest Notice.”
The Sydney Electric-Light Problem.
Another grievous wail appears in Sydney
Telegraph of Jan. 24, over the necessity of
handing over the electric-lighting of Sydney to
a private shindykit:—
Virtually speaking, the attitude of Parliament towards
the electric-light question has hitherto been that of the
dog in the manger. It would neither allow the City
Council to undertake the work under the Council’s condi-
tions, nor allow anyone else to do so, That is the sole
reason why the citizens of Sydney have still to be content
with a lighting system inferior to that of a progressive
third or fourth rate English provincial town. Years ago
private enterprise would have given the people the
benefit of modern ideas had not Parliament doggedly
stood in the way by opposing every application made for
permission to supply Sydney with the electric-light. No
scheme has been carried out, or even attempted, and the
ratepayers have to put up with an obsolete service for
rear that if any person were allowed to offer them an im-
proved one, even at a cheaper cost, he might make a profit
out of the transaction. It is all a part of the purblind
policy by which labor and capital are being kept idle all
over this colony, and the public deprived of conveniences
that would otherwise be made available to them. A com-
munity which condemns itself to stagnation through a
nervous dread that if people are allowed to work those
who render public services by the projection of useful
enterprises may get a return for their capital and energy,
must expect to have an “unemployed problem” that
nothing will solve. Sydney sits patiently in semi-darkness
rather than accept light, except from the State, which
always has an excuse for not giving it.
According to this last mixed statement, Sydney
won t accept the electric-light from a private
co., which is the sole reason why it doesn’t get
it. And, according to the other mixed
statement a little further back, Sydney
can t get electric-light from a private co.
if it wanted it, because Parliament
wont allow it. Therefore, the Telegraph
lepioaches Parliament for not giving the city
what the city wouldn’t take in any case, and it
also reproaches the city for not taking what
1 arliament wouldn’t give even if the city would
take it. Further, the paper alleges that Par-
liament has blocked the private and the muni-
cipal projects alike, and then it proceeds to
curse that body for blocking the private scheme
ie alleged blocking of the municipal scheme
evidently doesn’t matter. And it doesn’t once
mention that the influence which has most
s longly and consistently hindered municipal
electric-lighting in Sydney has been the Tele-
graph itseif, which has perpetually demanded
ttiat either a syndicate must do the work or it
must remain undone. Further, the inconsistent
paper complains that the people are afraid the
e ec no- lghting co. will get a decent return for
s money yet it wants to boom a scheme which
Mill practically wreck and bankrupt the Gas
money l T? l ' eveut it getting a return for its
• n i | *. e < ? as . e as between private and muni-
cipal electric-lighting and electric power-supplv
munioL 111 a /rr liDes - . The co. and the
mon 1 ¥ would both build with borrowed
* ? , ly the municipality could get the
noney at least 1 per cent, cheaper, and & if the


scheme cost =£1,000,000, that would be <£lo,ooo
a year saved to the community. Also, the
co. would have a big capital of its own
which would be swamped, most prob-
ably, in British financing of the Mid-
land Railway description, and it would
want 10 per cent, dividends on that, which
might mean another .£20,000 a year for the
ratepayers to liquidate, while the municipality
would want no dividends. And the municipal
scheme would probably mean an addition of Is.
in the £ to the rates, which would make the
taxpayer wish he had never consented to the
suicidal idea, while the gas-bill, or candle and
kerosene bill, or the bill of the private electric-
light co., would come in separately, and, because
it was separate, the same ratepayer would never
notice that it was equal to a rate of Is. 6d. in
the £. The writer’s experience is that his
rent is £75 a year aud gas-bill about £B—equal
to over 2s. in the £—and he assumes that he is
not “had” worse than the rest of the com-
munity. Yet a municipal electric-lighting rate
of Is. or Is. fid. in the £ would make the hair
of the community stand on end, simply because
it would then begin to realise for the first time
what it was paying.
The Beginning - of the Trouble.
Almost every day since the beginning of 1896
and the introduction of the new tariff the head-
line “Reduction in Wages,” or “Proposed
Reduction in Wages,” or something to the same
effect, has loomed up largely in the Sydney
dailies. The candle and boot trades are two in
which the trouble turned up simultaneously
the other day, and in the former the reduction
of wages already amounts to 10 per cent., with
a prospect of more reductions in the future.
Since the advent of the new tariff foreign
candles, in common with other goods, have
arrived in large quantities. It is not necessary
for the importer to sell any cheaper than the
local producer to make serious trouble in the
trade. If he sells the same quality at the same
price, the average retail dealer would just as
soon buy from him as from anybody else, and
simply by selling at the same price the foreign
article gets an equal show with the local one—
that is to say, it has a fair chance of getting
half the trade. And the consequent reduction
in the local business means that the manufactur-
ing co. has just the same capital to pay divi-
dends upon, the same rent, the same money
sunk in machinery, the same interest to pay on
its debts and overdrafts, the same travelling
expenses to pay (for it is necessary to
hunt at least as vigorously for half
the trade as for the whole of it, else
that half will vanish also), and with land
ami income tax piled on top of these losses it
must economise somewhere or go to the wall,
t his is how it stands if the imported article is
just the same quality and price as the loca
production and neither offers any advantages
whatever over the other ; it becomes a case of
dividing the business between the native and
the foreigner, and simply by division the profits
become less. But the foreigner has one great
advantage over the cornstalk which, without
offering any reduction in price, will go a long
way towards gradually wiping the latter out.
The N.S.W. manufacturers are of compara-
tively recent origin, and are mostly working in
a modest way with a small capital to supply a
small population. Therefore, they cannot
afford to lie out of their money so long as the
foreign makers who work on a larger scale, and
the latter, simply by giving longer credit, can
often secure the business. Moreover, when the
local man sells to the local wholesale dealer on
the usual three or four months’ paper, the said
paper costs about 7 per cent, bank discount ;
the English manufacturer can get the big im-
porter’s paper discounted in London for about
half these rates—which is another reason why
the foreigner can give longer credit. There are
various ways in which the big importer can
get ahead of the N.S.W. manufacturer, and
compel him to reduce wages and throw
men out of work, and gradually grind him
out of existence, without reducing prices to
the consumer by one fraction. And the im-
porting ring always has the final resource of
cutting prices until local competition is ex-
tinguished. The importer deals in hundreds
of lines, and if he sells candles below cost
while he is wiping out the native manufacturer
he cau recoup himself by raising the price of
something else ; the manufacturer deals in one
thing only, and has no other means of recoup-
ing himself, and so goes broke. Then the
importing ring can raise prices again, and make
a big profit, but though prices are up the manu-
facturer can’t make a new start ; even if he
could find his lost capital again, and get back his
costly machinery, which was sold by the bank-
ruptcy officials, the only result would be that
the importers would resume the cutting pro-
cess until he was again extinguished. Through
it all there is no need for the importer to make
any permanent reduction of prices, and, there-
fore, it may be assumed that, being an ordinary
human being, he won’t do so. If it is worth
the while of an importing ring to deliberately
wipe out any one of the manufacturing indus-
tries of New South Wales the opportunity to
do so will be ready to hand as soon as a few
more instalments of the great Foreign-trade
tariff come along.
Smellbourne’s Sewerage Scheme.
The one good, wholesome thing which emanated
from Smellbourne’s boom-time was a scheme of
underground sewerage for that germy metro-
polis. In those days of fleeting wealth and
visionary prosperity, life had many attractions
for the general public, and open drains came to
be viewed with a shudder. People ate, drank
and were merry, but the dread of dying to-
morrow from Smellbourne’s own particular
variety of typhoid, or diphtheria, hovered
round their pillows o’ nights. A dream of fair
sewers was ultimately reduced to a tangible
form. Miy Mansergh, a British sanitary
engineer of repute, supplied a scheme of under-
ground sewerage calculated to serve the city for
a century. Then a local engineer was commis-
sioned to reduce the original scheme to less
costly dimensions, and certain councillors hav-
ing seen that the lamented proposal was good,
as far as it went, blessed it, aud a Met. Board
of Works grew out of the new idea. The
Board somehow resolved itself into Fitz Gibbon,
aud that inspired poet, after tripping ’Ome to
float a loan on strictly unfinancial principles,
started on the first section of the sewerage
scheme. This first section, seemingly, is nearly-
completed. The neighborhood of Smellbourne
Town Hall is understood to be within a few
weeks, or mouths, of decent sanitary condi-
tions. A citizen will soon feel comparatively
safe from- poisonous gases on the steps of
the G.P.O. Fitz Gibbon’s chance of living
for ever is visibly improving, and yet Fat
Man is not happy. The cost of under-
ground sewers falls upon ratepayers ; the
voice of the property-owner wails in protest
from amid suburban stinks, aud the respectable
daily press considers that any further abolition
of fever-microbes ought to be prevented by Act
of Parliament. Smellbourne’s suburbs, say
Fat Man and his newspapers, can’t afford to be
purified until the rateable value of property
begins to boom again, and things are as they
were when the sanitary scheme, viewed from
afar, appeared cheap at any price. Fat Man,
needless to mention, is largely represented in
this matter by reconstructed banks and similar
soulless institutions, whose own private
stinks would have rendered them in-
different to the drainage question even
if their financial interests hadn’t forced
them into furious disapproval of a ninepenny
sewerage rate. And, since every potent person
in Smellbourne prays for the preservation of at
least one shaky bank, it is to be feared that the
death-rate will be sacrificed to the sewer-raie,
so to speak. The press mouthpieces of tremb-
ling directors exhort each little property-owner
to swell the chorus of outcry against any further
laying down of underground pipes, and when a
landlord agitates in one direction Providence
seldom hears the bitter opposition cry of the
tenant who pays the rent.
Tiie Seddon Ministry and the Bank of
New Zealand.
Mr. John Murray writes :
The Editor, Bulletin. —Sir, —The article on bank re-
construction in the last Bulletin is marred by a mistake,
which I ask permission to point out. It is stated that the
Government intervention “ did not procure any reduction
in the rate of interest on deposits,” that “ that part of the
heavy load was not diminished one iota,” that “an addi-
tional load of £BO,OOO per annum was piled up on the
already tottering bank.” Now there are two ways of
effecting a reduction in the interest payable to a creditor.
The debtor may say, “ I cannot pay you what you
are rightfully entitled to; you must take less or
go without.” This method was not adopted in
the Maoriland case because, under the conditions
then and there existing, it necessarily meant the
closing of the three New Zealand Banks —the disper-
sion of their best business—with the loss to the public
revenue, damage to colonial industries, and calamity to
innocent persons, so graphically pourtrayed in Tiie Bulle-
tin. Further, it is not a method conducive to good credit:
and the effects of its operation in Australia did not
encourage to its adoption in Maoriland. There is a
better way. You may say to your creditor, “You are
receiving too much interest, you must take less, or—
here’s your money.” This was the method preferred
by the Seddon Ministry, with the following results: (1)
By means of the financial resources supplied to the bank
it has been able to reduce the interest on its colonial
deposits from 5 per cent, to 3J per cent. (2) It has been
paying off, or renewing at a very low rate, English
deposits which also bore 5 per cent. (3) It has partly
paid off, partly converted at a greatly reduced rate,
£1,500,000 of Estates Co. debentures on which 5i per cent
was payable. By these operations the bank saves £75,000
per annum in interest, after allowing 4 per cent, upon
so much of the Government £2,000,000 as has been
employed in them. True, the whole of this saving has
not come as profit to the bank, much of it has
gone in easier rates to borrowers, whereby the colony’s
industries are aided; a result not deprecated by the
Seddon Ministry, but in pursuance of their settled policy.
As for the “ additional burden of £BO,OOO per annum,”
how could such a thing be, when the money is used in
paying off pre-existing burdens, or could be so used, if
not more remuneratively employed in the business of the
bank ? The reasons for raising the £2,000,000 at 4 per
cent, instead of 3£ per cent, are capable of ample ex-
planation, but I am reluctant to trespass on your
space. I will only ask permission to add that
the action of the Seddon Ministry in a sudden,
dangerous, and most difficult emergency, besides
averting a banking smash, conserving financial
credit, and lowering rates to borrowers, as already set
forth, has led to the absorption of a weak and superfluous
bank ; has started the experiment whether a State Bank
can be made a practical and useful institution in a demo-
cratic country; and has established in actual operation
the wholesome principle of State Audit, for which Tiie
Bulletin has long strenuously but unsuccessfully con-
tended.
The Queensland Situation.
The Boodle Government of Queensland has
apparently got a new lease of existence through
the utter incapacity of its opponents to sink
their own small differences in the face of an
overwhelming danger from without. The
Labor-party and the direct Opposition have
decided that they can’t unite and show a solid
front to the common enemy, therefore they will
fight against each other at the polls as well as
against the Nelson Government, and they will
neutralise each other’s vote in litany cases, and
in this triangular scrimmage the Ministry and
the Land-Grant Railway and Q.N. Bank
and cheap nigger-labor interests will almost
inevitably come out on top once more,
with another long lease of power in pros-
pective. The trouble arose mainly through the
fixed resolve of the Queensland Labor-party to
have all or nothing, and it is in a fair way to
have nothing. The Labor men had a carefully-
considered democratic programme, and they
insisted, as the price of an offensive and defen-
sive treaty with the direct Opposition, led by
Powers, that the latter body should accept
this programme in its entirety. The Opposition
was willing to accept by far the greater part of
it, but demurred to a few clauses, and hence the
treaty fell through. If an arrangement had been
arrived at it was intended that the Oppositionists
and Labor men should strictly refrain from
running candidates against each other ; that,
in electorates where the Labor interest was the
stronger, the Opposition party should give its
undivided support to the Labor candidate, and
that the Labor-party should do the same in
constituencies where the Opposition interest
was the more powerful of the two. This
arrangement would have given the Labor-
party’s nominees by far the larger number of
electorates ; it would have ensured that the
anti-nigger-labor and anti-land-grant-rail way-
swindle parties would have used their forces to
the best advantage, and, if the coalition had
come out on top, it would have been mainly a
Labor coalition, and the new Government would
have been in the main a Labor Government.
But the party, unfortunately, did not know
when to give way a little, and because the
Opposition would not accept the whole of its
programme it refused to come to any terms.
Therefore, Powers, the Opposition leader, has
resolved to retire from politics. The Labor-
party and the Oppositionists will run amuck at
each other as well as at the common enemy.
The more or less democratic forces will be
divided against themselves while the Boodle
Government following will be solid ; and the
result, unless something wholly unexpected
happens, will be auother triumph for the
Ministry of crookedness aud retrogression. It
is a pitiable prospect, but it is only the natural
result of not knowing when to give way a little
in order to gain a great deal, and of standing
too firm at the wrong time. The policy of “Ail
or Nothing ” generally results in nothing.
Should Parkes manage to squeeze into New
South Wales Parliament through the Waverley
door, he will just be in time to meet two ancient
acquaintances on the floor of the House. Reid
promises to introduce when Parliament meets a
Bill dealing with aliens and a Bill dealing with
adulteration, and when each comes up the old
man will rise up and say : “ Before most of
you were born I brought this subject into the
light of Parliamentary consideration.” In
1854 he obtained a Select Committee to inquire
into Indian and Chinese immigration, and in
1855 he moved for a Committee to report upon
the adulteration of common articles of food.
On each occasion he will, before sitting down,
remark : “ Take my work out of the Parlia-
mentary proceedings and nothing will remain
but shreds and patches.”
The Bulletin again asks grocer Kidman, of
Sydney, to explain this advt. which appears
in his name in the daily papers :

Considering that the protective duties on sugar,
condensed milk, rice, cornflour, and preserved
fish remain—aud will remain for some time—
just where they were, what has the new tariff'
got to do with the reductions on them, if there
are any ? And as there was no duty on sago or
soda, and, therefore, they couldn’t be made any
freer than they were before, what has the new
tariff to do with any alleged reduction on these ?
And if sugar, condensed milk, rice, cornflour,
and fish have come down so heavily in price
under a continuance of Protection, what is the
matter with Protection, anyhow ? And, under
these circumstances, isn’t the whole affair a
pretty mean kind of misrepresentation ? [The

John Johnson, found guilty of perjury on very
dubious evidence in the notorious Butler case,
and sentenced to three years’ penal servitude,
was released last week before he had served
fifteen months. Presumably even Mr. Just-ice
Gould has some rudimentary sense of the
sharp contrast between the treatment
meted in Botany Bay to the man who (at
worst) lied to save his sister from a vil-
lainous conspiracy against her honor, and
to the lawyer who took part in the
conspiracy. • Johnson, the perjurer, got three
years ; Rofe, the conspirator, who tempted
him to perjury (and who was himself denounced
by the Judge as a perjurer), served not one
day. After some weeks of frozen deliberation,
Minister Gould has apparently seen that these
things might seem, to a hypercritical eye, to
cast some reflection on the local methods of
administering alleged justice ; and Johnson is
released. Judge VVindeyer, of course, is a
long way off now. '
If Victoria can grow sufficient beet sugar to
supply her own requirements the result is esti-
mated by the Age to pan out as follows :
The number of agricultural workers required to culti-
vate the beet, 10,000; the number required to cultivate
10,000 acres for horse-feed for horses employed in beet
cultivation, 1000 ; the number employed in the factories,
1000 ; the number employed in distilling the sugar beet
molasses into spirits, 500 ; the number required to manu-
facture 4000 tons of artificial manure used in the beet
culture, 300; the number of agricultural implement
makers required to make the appliances used, 1000;
splitters, fencers, carpenters, &c., 500 ; ironworkers em-
ployed in erecting and maintaining the machinery, 1000 ;
the number of stock fed on the sugar beet pulp, with
chaff and other mixtures as in Europe, 20,000 cattle and
80,000 sheep ; to which has to be added a large increase to
the railway traffic of the colony in the conveyance of beet,
pulp, artificial manures, coal and lime.
Also, all these people will support, in their
turn, grocers, butchers, bakers, tailors, boot-
makers, rum-sellers, tobacconists, bookmakers,
cricket-matches, newspapers, cronk banks, &c.,
and will pay taxes, and fines when they get
drunk, and will help the undertakers and
tombstone-makers by dying occasionally, and
so on. Therefore, the question doesn’t begin
and end with the price of sugar as Freetraders
allege —or anything like it.
The frequently-asserted right of the holder to
sellor transfer the unused portionof a return rail-
way or boat ticket needs badly uniform Supreme
Court determination. At present, persons sell-
ing these documents are readily convicted in
Sydney but uniformly discharged in Adelaide,
and are similarly variously handled in other
quarters. The question is : Is the piece of
paper a property for which the holder has given
consideration '! If it be, then it must be in
some fashion a negotiable commodity. In an
English Bankruptcy Court, recently, the official
assignee demanded from the bankrupt a first-
class annual railway-ticket, but the Judge
decided that that asset was valueless to the
creditors, inasmuch as, if it were put up for
sale and anyone bought it, the railway com-
pany would be justified in cancelling it.
At Ballarat, the other week, a pub. land-
lady, summoned for having her gates ajar on the
Sabbath, pleaded that it was merely for the pur-
pose of letting the painters in to paint the bar-
room. Case dismissed, but on appeal the decision
was Upset on the ground that they might have
been painting the bar red.
The Boers and the British.
Dear Bulletin,—-What splendid specimens of
“red-raw ” Republican-Democrats we brummagem
Australian-Britishers are ! Dailey is dead, but
the bray of the Soudan Donkey is still heard
throughout this free and enlightened land. That
mystical and glorified filibuster, “ Chinese ”
Cordon, is gone, and the Mahdi has disappeared ;
but Cecil Rhodes and Barney Barnato have arisen
and occupy their fetich-stools ; and we who failed
to “ rescue ” Gordon or “smash” the Mahdi are
ready to make another raid into Africa—this time
to justify medico Jameson and down “ Oom ”
Paul. This is what Premier Reid’s cable to Salis-
bury really means; and there is no doubt that
it truthfully interprets the jingoistic sentiments
at present held by thousands of Australians
regarding the impudent outrage perpetrated
against the free aud independent South African
Republic by the rascals and bandits of the Char-
tered Company.
* * * *
History is said to repeat itself in cycles: in
Australia it repeats itself in decades. Premier
Reid to-day would have no more difficulty in des-
patching a Transvaal contingent to help England,
were she so minded, to settle Kruger and
Maximise the Boers, than had Dailey ten years
ago iii sending forth the Soudan contingent to
assist in “ smashing ” the Mahdi, and minimising
the Soudanese whom Gladstone declared “ were
rightly struggling to be free.” To-day the Aus-
tralian people, press, pulpit, and Parliament are
as ready to applaud and condone any effort or any
atrocity against Dutch freedom in Africa as they
were to justify and glorify the attempt to compel
the Soudanese Arabs to servilely submit to the
oppressive and extortionate rule of the Khedive
in the interest of British money-bags and Hebraic
syndicates. The motive and the method are much
the same now as then. The only difference is
that, in the ca,se of the Soudanese, it was a
civilised Christian nation making war upon a
semi-savage Mahommedan people in the interests
of Jewish holders of Egyptian bonds ; whereas, in
the present instance, it would be the same civilised
Christian nation making wanton war on another
civilised and Christian nation in the interests of
the South African Chartered Syndicate, con-
trolled by the London Jews.
* * * *
Isolated here at the Antipodes, and dependent for
their information concerning international ques-
tions upon “ Cockney ” cables, which convey the
kindred sentiments of the Colonial office, the
West-end military clubs, and the pewter-pot
patriotism of East London music-halls, Austra-
lians may be, and often are, easily bulldozed into
espousing the wrong side of any dispute or
quarrel in which England is concerned. England
has a great and noble mission to fulfil, and well
has she fulfilled it—sometimes. She is not always
right: history records how often she has been
wrong, but patriotism justly forbids a recital of
the record. Her attitude towards the “chartered”
ruffians who raided the Transvaal is, so far, calm
and dignified, and reflects the highest honor on
the wisdom and statesmanship of Salisbury and
Chamberlain, who have inspired and directed it.
In thus refusing to allow her policy to be dictated
Dy the “ bosses ” of big mining syndicates, and in
reprobating the gross and wanton outrage per-
petrated on the political and territorial in-
tegrity of a free and independent state, England
has shown that she recognises that the bloody
and perfidious game of Clive and Warren Hastings
in India cannot be safely played in South Africa.
That England recognises this is not so much a
proof that she has grown weaker, but that, with
experience and greater responsibilities, she has
become wiser and more humane, in which direc-
tions she has still room for ampler developments.
England’s attitude at the present juncture, in the
light of her past treatment of the Boers, assumes
the pleasing form of a moral reparation ; vide the
black, blood-stained page of British rule in South
Africa.
* * * *
Instead of the deeply-wronged, much-annoyed
people that they are, one would imagine, from the
descriptions of them by Australian jingoes, who
have never seen or read about them, that they are
a set of gloomy, dastardly, savage nigger-drivers,
“ without'God or hope in the world, who refuse
to recognise and accept the blessings of British
rule. As described by Eroude, Aylward, and
others who have travelled and lived among them,
they are among the noblest of mankind, physically,
morally, and politically. They may be morose,
but they are moral and manly ; bigoted in
religion, but pious and humane ; fanatical for
freedom, but magnanimous to their oppressors
and aggressors ; as their whole history and recent
humanity on the battle-field, and forbearance
-towards their vanquished enemies, plainly prove.
No people has suffered more for freedom’s
sake than have the Boers at the hands of Eng-
land. No people has made such peaceful sacri-
fices for political freedom ; nor is there any
record of more gallant and determined battles
fought for liberty than those waged by the Boers
—when hunted down and driven to desperation—
against the galling tyranny of England. The
heroes of the American rebellion and of the
French Revolution have been admired and praised
by English historians and poets, and held up as
examples of patriotic devotion. But while these
heroes were earning the plaudits of admiring
millions and the eulogies of posterity the almost
unknown and all-but ignored Dutch republicans —
the “Puritan Fathers” of South Africa —on the
remoter stage of the Cape, were making even
more gallant, because unapplauded and unassisted,
efforts to preserve their freedom from the
oppressing invader. The chronicle of English
outrages against Dutch liberty at the Cape
reads like a chapter of Indian history, or
a page from the black-book of Spanish
crime in South America. Dutch conservatism
and Boer opposition to enlightened progress and
rational reform must and will recede before the
influx of new men and new ideas. President
Kruger’s utterances and the attitude of the Volks-
raad in the hour of triumph are hopeful signs of
coming constitutional change. But the prestige and
stability of the British Empire are lowered and
shaken when such crimes as Jameson’s filibuster-
ing raid can be perpetrated in her name and under
her flag with impunity so far as punishment or
censure of the prime movers is concerned. -

Pinero’s play, “The Notorious Mrs. Ebbs-
smith,” staged at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday,
ought to bowl out the sex-problem drama for a
long time to come. It is less interesting than
“Mrs. Tanqueray”; it is long, rather heavy in
some places, and morbid in most other places, and
it doesn’t bring the problem, if there is one, any
nearer a solution. Also, it doesn’t even show
distinctly that there is any problem at all, and its
chief result, so far as concerns The Bulletin, is
to make this paper lay its soulful curse on sex-
problem plays m general, including the Notorious
Mrs. Tanqsmith, and the Second Mrs. Ebbtank,
and the Second Mrs. Notorious Smithtank, and
the Notorious Mrs. Secondtank, and all the rest.
The story consists of a man and a woman living
together in the old, old way that men and women
are so much addicted to when they have nothing
better to do. The woman has buried her sensual
husband ; the man has not buried his cold, heart-
less wife. They have a lady friend who has
planted her bad husband, and a duke who has also
made a miserable marriage, and the lesson so far
seems to be that no one should get married be-
cause it always leads to unpleasantness. There-
fore, to show the beauty of the other thing, the
man and woman lead together a feverish, shriek-
ful life of blessed freedom, and the man proposes
every now and then to “chuck” the woman in
his own selfish interests, and the woman’s weary,
blistered soul crawls after him on all fours, m
abject terror lest he should do it. The woman
desires that their union should be purely platonic
and intellectual; and the man, who grows weary of
her unless he can see large quantities of her at the
dinner-table, insists on her wearing the most
Y-shaped costume ever seen on any stage, and she
gets into it in a shame-faced fashion because she
begins to realise that only a great area of flesh
will retain his wavering allegiance. And even it
only retains him for two uncertain hours, so at the
end of that time she casts him off as a fleshly
worm, and goes away to eat out her heart by her-
self, and the sex-problem remains just where it
was.
* , * * *
So far as can be gathered from the scanty
information available, Mrs. Ebbsmith’s marriage
was utterly miserable because her husband insisted
on treating her according to his own earthy stan-
dard, as a piece of property and so much attractive
live meat, whereas she desired something more
intellectual. And her lady-friend’s marriage was
unhappy, seemingly, because her husband also re-
garded her from a similar Y-shaped point of view.
And Lucas Cleeve’s marriage was a miserable
failure because he insisted on treating his wife on
the. same animal and evening-dress-cut-very-low
basis, and she wouldn’t let him. And his life
with Mrs. Ebbsmith was a failure because, in
the first place, she wouldn’t throw her undressed
shoulders into the contract, and his affection was
of the kind that required shoulders to keep it
from dying out suddenly; and when she sacri-
ficed herself and got into evening-dress, they
had an hour or two of glorious happiness, and
then he began to long for other undraped shoulders
which he hadn’t yet seen—or, at least, hadn’t laid
his head against. And the moral of it all
is that some people are earthy to their
innermost souls, and some are not, and
that some people get very tired of some other
people, and that there is no remedy either for
these people or for the other people. “ Mrs. Ebb-
smith’’ is a play of one man and two women and
very little else. There is little action in it; most
of the time the whole proceedings consist of an
anguished woman pervading the room in feverish
passion, and watching a man younger than herself
as he gradually grows tired of her, and wants, and
yet doesn’t want, to throw her overboard. There
is a large stove in the room, but most of the
characters seem to forget that it is a stove and
lean their elbows on it m odd moments, and every
one expects to notice an odour of burnt duke.
One touch of nature comes in when Mrs. Ebb-
smith throws the Bible into the stove, and then
drags it out in sudden terror, her acquired
atheism not being strong enough for the occasion.
And when at last the man suggests a judicious
compromise whereby he may live with two women
at once, Mrs. Ebbsmith gives him up and takes
refuge in the household of a clergyman. She was
religious when she was young. Her marriage with
one stupid sensualist made her an unbeliever, and
the fact that she isn’t married to another sen-
sualist makes her a believer again. Which is a
purposeless kind of finish and leads nowhere in
particular, and she would have done much better
to take refuge in the stove and end it all.
» * * *
Mrs. Brough is far from being at her best
as Mrs. Ebbsmith, but the part is long and
heavy and wholly unsatisfactory and very
difficult to deal with. Probably she deals
with it as well as circumstances admit. To-
wards the end it becomes a physical weari-
ness a spectacle of a dead-tired woman
in evening dress dragging her load of desolation
uphill like an exhausted Israelite fetching building
material for a pyramid. Cecil Ward’s part is well
played, but its utter repulsiveness is against it.
The only characters in the drama who don’t
make the audience feel old are Miss Faber, as an
angelic young lady who tries to rescue the bat-
tered heroine ; Boucicault, as an ancient, gouty
roue, who takes his wickedness plain, without
snuffle; Carey, Brough, and Miss Spong. The
latter lady leaves a better impression behind her
than usual. But the aggregate effect is that the
problem play is a heavy, disjointed thing, like a
ton of loose bricks in a troubled sea; that it leads
nowhere, except to snuffle and uncharitableness
and disgust and emptiness and premature old age
and much bare flesh ; and that it would be better
for a tired world if the whole dismal story of the
115th Mrs. Tanksmith had never been written.
** * *
The “Work Girl’’-—so-called because she
isn’t once seen working all through five acts, and
spends her time mostly in moaning on a bridge
about her unauthorised infant —still retains its
hold on the penny-dreadful section of the public,
at Sydney Royal. Westmacott s larrikin with
the fruit-barrow, and Florrie Forde’s larky girl of
the “ push,” at least save the drama from getting
mouldy, and seem to fit in well with the atmos-
phere of metaphorical gin and pork pie which has
been gradually coming over the house for a year
or two past, and lend a beautiful aspect of com-
pleteness to things. Westmacott has sundry other
novelties on hand, but apparently they won’t be
wanted for a little while longer, and meanwhile
the unauthorised infant can be heard growing up
audibly somewhere in the back premises.

Sydney Tivoli has turned on Florence
Wilton, vice the departed Alice Leamar, and the
unstable gallery boy who gave his heart to Alice
a few weeks ago now gives it to Florence instead,
and will pass it on to the next charmer just as
readily when Florence has departed. The Sydney
Music Hall has suppressed the nigger element
and is going strong as a purely Caucasian show,
and seems better for the change. The comic
African is pretty well played out in any case.
Perhaps a show with four Chinese end-men might
take for a little while as a novelty, assuming that
Chinese jokes don’t deal too exclusively with
stolen chickens.

The pantomime at Her Majesty’s (Sydney)
dies this week of a respected old age, and the
evergreen Uainpier reappears on Saturday in a
five-act dram', ailed “To the West.” The scene
is laid in Wetcralia—a region full of dramatic pos-
sibilities if only they are rightly worked. What a
lot of spectacular material there is in the delayed
telegram that gets to its destination in a fly-blown
state after th ree weeks’ journeying; the thirst-
maddened prospector scooting naked through the
bush in pursuit of a mirage ; the lonesome “ soak”
with an Afghan washing his feet in the only
water to be found in 100 square miles of country ;
the whirlwind blowing an avalanche of kerosene-
tins and waste-paper down Bayley-street, Cool-
gardie ; Calvert (and valet) exploring in top-hats
—then a view of a bush pub., with Calvert (and
valet) appearing suddenly round the corner and
being saved from a dreadful death by thirst; the
salted claim with a transformation-scene showing
the British shareholder cursing in the distance;
the bush-liar, the snake-liar, and the horse-liar;
the new-chum arriving in bathing-pants at a Wes-
tralian “lake” and gazing on a dry depression
covered with glaring salt; the Hampton Plains
Syndicate in the distance, and all the rest.

The co. at Sydney Criterion has been doing
a steadily-improving business and seems to have
set in for a season, The Criterion is at present
the only comedy house in Sydney for “ The
Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith ” would only be regarded
as comedy by those people who laugh uproariously
in a morgue, and there should be abundant room
for one home of innocent merriment in the big
city. “Hide and Seek” is at least bright and
cheerful, and Shine’s Scotchman is a mellow old
person whom it is a pleasure to meet. If the
woman element could only be improved a little
there should be a good time ahead for Mr. W. J.
Wilson’s enterprise. “ Mixed ”isto be staged on
Saturday.

Miss Polly Emery, the most effective stage
slavey in Australia, whose Belinda in “ Our
Boys ” was a poem written in coal smudge, and
who brightened up Terry’s dreariest comedy with
her pourtrayal of a certain flat-footed spinster, is
going the way of all Australian talent —to London.
Next Wednesday afternoon the bright and coaly
Belinda has a farewell benefit at Sydney Royal,
lent for the purpose by Mr. Westmacott, and all
the available mummers of Sydney (including B.
and B.) will join in and endeavor to make it a
show worthy of the occasion.

“Djin-Djin,” slightly revised, rages with
undimmished fury at Melb. Princess’s. On
Saturday the house was packed twice, and dead-
heads calling to enquire about the free list found
it suspended as usual. Which reminds us of the
difference between a condemned felon and a free
list. The one gets suspended before being cut
down, whilst the other is cut down before it is
suspended. A poor joke, but permissible in con-
nection with a pantomime. Changes in the
“ Djin-Djin ” performance are not vast improve-
ments as a rule, and one or two of the new items
deserve instant burial. Elton has a dismal
comic song concerning a cottage by the sea;
also Miss Florence Young substitutes for
her tuneful tale of Mary’s conversion to
maternity a masher ballad which doesn’t
reach the heart. The Bulletin must protest
against the withdrawal of Mary, who wanted to
be a fairy, but was mercifully Captured by a re-
spectable young man and made into a Ma. The
sentiment of the song was calm and elevating, and
Miss Young’s method of dandling a visionary
twin seemed somewhat new. It was the action of
a young lady trammelled by the masculine in-
fluence of tights, so to speak. A medley duet
between Ivy Scott and Carrie Moore and a
happy trapeze act by three bright boy Banvards
are very successful changes in the show.
Little Carrie Moore, in trousers, is a pro-
mising young artist, almost wonderful, con-
sidering that her stage experience has been limited
to “Djin-Djin.” Coleman has elaborated his scare-
crow dance without improving that originally
perfect piece of humor, and the earthquake falls
with even better effect than ever. Likewise the
ballets continue to grow upon the immortal soul
of this excellent family journal. Next Saturday
will bring a jubilee souvenir night of “Djin
Djin.” On the following Friday the beauteous
spectacle will retire from Melb. for the present,
unless held back by force of public opinion.
Obliteration of Hingland’s foes ceased at
Melb. Alexandra on Saturday, some time before
midnight. This was owing, so Dan Barry stated,
to the rapacity of the literary monster v
“The Roll of the Drum” and demandedan un-
heard-of royalty upon each performance.
Some of Britain’s blood-stained heroesi are
just now appearing as a virtuous Insh pis Y>
and the Alexandra stage is largely S
over to haymaking, and jigs, and wild io •
The eternal parish priest reproves sin in his best
Irish-drama manner, and the swate colleen prefers
Patsy to the perfidious Saxon rent - collector.
“ Eileen Oge,” which resembles all other potheen
productions, and has the natural advantage o
being set up by a real Irish manager, is biilea or
five nights only. The name of its successor was a
profound secret at time of writing.

The only Rickards and the lovely Alice
Leamar have decided to leave Melb. Opera House
this week, although they are at present m much
warmer demand than at first. It takes a Melb.
gallery some time to discover the social significance
of an unaccustomed song, such as the “ American
Millionaire;” and even the “’Addock .Smoker s
Daughter” doesn’t smite them hard until they
have made enquiries re ’Addocks and learned how
strong they smell. Another of Rickards s ditties
was quite new when he started on it. It in-
troduced him in a quiet cloth jacket and
skirt, and told of how he, Rickards spin-
ster, swallowed 15 small glasses of port
in a kind doctor’s “insulting'’ room. I his
costume didn’t quite harmonise with the inter-
pretation of the song, but when it was exchanged
for gaudier apparel, more in keeping with fifteen
small ports at a sitting, the singer began to get a
good return for his labor. “ Dear kind doctor is
now a large success, and a first-class insult to the
medical profession. On Saturday next the old-
established London jingo vocalist, Charles God-
frey, makes a first appearance at.the Opera House,
where, by the way, the Lenton Bros, are valuable
additions to the co.
At Poverty Point.
Pro. : “ Some trades-union is necessary among ‘ pros.,’
for their protection as regards salaries. Variety people
suffer the most. From £1 10s. to £3 a week (and that
generally owed) is the usual with small artistes. One
singer was paid 3s. for two songs at a well-patronised
pleasure resort, on Anniversary day. Where does the
living wage come in ? ”
J. C. Williamson has no intention of running melo-
drama at Melb. T.R., as rumored. Never again will he
run two theatres in the same town. All the same he
would like to see good biz. done at the Royal, as he has

straight from Paris.
Dear Bulletin, —Somebody writes to inform you that
he never knew an actor who didn’t lose ground with the

Rickards intends re-decorating and re-fitting Melb.
Opera House, and modelling his programmes with a view
to catching “sassiety” circles, since “sassiety” people
are displaying a desire to visit the show incog. There is
a proverb about two stools.
Dear Bulletin, —I see you state that Sir William Robin-
son has re-named the alleged comic opera, in which I
collaborated with him, or he with me, “The Handsome
Ransom, or the Brigand’s Bride ”; also, that an alleged
author, by the name of Guy Boothby, has re-written the
libretto. All of which is very rough on yours truly. I
originally entitled the unfortunate work by the above
name. My “Excellent” collaborator did not quite like
it, nor did I, and I suggested “ Predatoros,” the name of
the hero. This was decided on, and now I see Sir William
has reverted to the title under which the piece was first
performed at Government House, Perth. As to Mr.
Boothby’s revision of the piece, I know nothing about
him or his work.—Yours, Francis Hart. Perth. W.A.
Superstitious pros, think Nellie Farren’s ill-luck dates

Nine American mummers leave ’Frisco, March 3rd, to
play “Trilby,” at Melb. Princess’s, early in April. J.C.W.
originally intended to bring out only two players—for the
Trilby and Svengali parts—but he found that taking local
actors from other plays would upset his arrangements,
and so cabled to Musgrove for a fuller co.
One feature in “ Mrs. Ebbsmith,”-at Sydney Lyceum, is
the way Mrs. Brough fits her dress to the occasion. In
Act I. she is a serious-minded agnostic in a neatly-fitting
dark costume. In Acts 11. and 111. she is a desperate)
worldly woman in a glaringly V-shaped evening-dress.
And in Act IV. she has gone back for consolation to her
long-lost religion, and is a Magdalen in a dingy brown
frock, lank, disordered hair, a pallid face, and a scorched
hand—the one with which she had snatched the Bible out
of the fire—tied up in a rag. An ill-fitting frock and hair
rushed together in a scraggy, unpicturesque knob are the
outward symptoms of piety on the stage as well as else-
where. Why doesn’t some original dramatist make his
Magdalen repent in a neatly-fitting expensive frock with
soft creamy lace at her neck and wrists, and her hair in
perfect order, and silk stockings, and the smallest of tan
shoes at 355. a pair? The persistent teaching of the same
old doctrine that a woman can only reform with her
oldest clothes on simply means that the woman who has
any good clothes left feels called on to remain wicked.
During the singing of a rabid jingo verse in Melbourne
Panto, the band suddenly interpolates a spasm of “ Rule

ably true that much of the prevailing British ‘ ‘ patriotism ”
is “ made in Germany.”

After capturing the North Island of Maonland, Fitz-

of the Opera House, held by Bland Holt with “ Saved from

lease to the circus on the ground that the bass drum
would interfere with the agonised sobs of the convicts
wife. The council declined to go back on its word, so
Providence took a hand and beat the I itzes by two games
to one. Just as the big tent got comfortably full on open-
ing nldit, along came the usual balmy breeze—the thing
that makes the Wellington man always hold his hat down
hard as he goes round a corner. The first to go were the
quarter-poles, one woman getting her head split, and
then the audience began to struggle round Dan for
tickets en route. Next night, down came the rain, but
the show beat the weather. Next morning, a 40-knot
breeze laid out the whole concern, so the brothers folded
up their tents and silently stole away to the driUshed,
where business is reported first-rate.

Tremendous Death - rate for
January, 18V(>.
The death-rate in the colony of N.S.W. this
year is something appalling, and when the returns
are produced by the Statistician, the public will
be simply astounded. During the last three
weeks the average has been 17 people per day,
the cause of whose death has been directly or
indirectly attributable to the intense heat. Doctors
are recommending their patients to give up smok-
ing heavy tobaocos during the hot weather, and
to indulge in Frossard’s Cavour Cigars, which
are mild and fragrant and a delicious smoke —
recommended by all who have ever tried them.
They are cheap and excellent, and obtainable

The Wild-Cat Column.
The old, placid West Australian Bank held its
109th half-yearly meeting the other day. It paid its
usual dividend at-the rate of 17J per cent, per annum
;£7000), and had £3661 left to carry forward. The W.A.
Bank has a capital of £BO,OOO, a reserve of £lOO,OOO, and
£30,188 to credit of profit andjoss. Also, it presents the
most remarkable balance-sheet in Australasia. Its liabili-
ties for notes, deposits, bills in circulation, and balances
due to other banks are set down at £1,495,000, and
against this it claims to have £674,000 in coin and bullion,
or over 45 per cent, of all liabilities. Also, Govt, securi-
ties, amounts due by other banks, notes of other banks,
and money in transit, are reported as representing
another £355,000, so that the W.A. Bank, by its own show-
ing, could pay off three-fourths of its deposits at a few days
notice if it wanted to. Also, it seems to make its profits
by keeping the money in the cellar. Yet this amazing
institution, with half its assets lying practically idle, talks
of issuing new shares and enlarging the capital, in order
to extend business. A bank that is making 17£ per cent,
in its own old, slow way, and has such a stupendous pile
of cash behind it, should be content, and if it proposes to
get out of its groove and start booming in its respectable
old age, and try to be a rushing, up-to-date affair, the
most probable result will be that it will start down-hill
and never see its big reserve or its 17i per cent, any more.
The W.A. Bank doesn’t even profess to have its accounts
audited—at least it publishes no auditors’ certificate.
Judging by the experience of Mercantile, Federal, City of
Melbourne, and many other audits, this doesn’t matter
much ; still, the fact is characteristic of Westralia. The
W.A. Bank belongs mostly to the Six Families, and the
idea that any inky hireling should presume to overhaul
the accounts of the Six Families is probably regarded as
sacrilege.
• * * •
The National Bank of Australasia (Melb.) and
the Bank of Victoria have both given the required notice
that they will pay off a portion of their reconstructed de-
posits next May. The National pays one-fifth of its total
deposits, equal to £1,000,000, and, as it has over £2,500,000
in cash and liquid assets, this should be an easy process.
Probably most of the money will be re-deposited, and,
even in that case, the reduction of interest should save
the bank at least £lO,OOO a year. The Bank of Victoria
pays all of the instalments due in June, ’96, and June,
’97, and one-tenth of the other instalments. This pro-
bably means the release of about £600,000, but as the
Bank of Victoria jumbles together in its report c \rrent
accounts, new fixed deposits, reconstructed ditto, interest
accrued on all deposits, rebate on bills, and “ other
moneys,” it is difficult to form an accurate estimate.
Unless the withdrawals are very heavy—which seems
wholly unlikely Victoria’s two soundest banks will
probably be able to release more instalments very shortly.
The Land Mortgage Bank of Victoria again
reports that it isn’t feeling at all well in its inside. The
loss for the half-year is £8847, whereas last half the loss
was only £6617, and for the six months ended Dec., ’94, it
was £6038. The Land Mortgage concern has thus lost
£21,500 in 18 months, and as the case is steadily growing
more and more aggravated, the manager has packed up a
boiled Shirt and started for London to make the usual
arrangement with the debenture-holders who have
already gone through one arrangement. The debentures
amount to £900,000 at 4£ per cent., and if this is reduced
to 2J per cent., as proposed, the saving will be £lB,OOO a
year, which, for a co. that is losing £8847 in six
months, is not anything like a large enough margin.
What the Land Mortgage Bank badly needs is a reduction
of interest to 1£ per cent. The chief asset against this
£900,000 liability is £1,057,000 of “loans and interest
owing,” and, as the institution candidly acknowledges
that “ nothing has been written off,” it is impossible to
say whether any definite amount is bad. Anyhow, the
institution professes to have a whole million of callable
capital, and why it doesn’t call this up and proceed to pay
off the debenture incubus, and then nurse its assets till it
gets back to solvency, is never explained. What is the
good of a million of available capital if it is only to be
called up when it isn’t wanted and none of it comes along
when it is wanted ? An alleged available capital which
doesn’t seem available in the hour of need is just as valu-
able as a brick. The brick, at all events, doesn’t arouse
any groundless expectations.
The Perpetual Trustee Co. (Sydney) is progress-
ing favorably with the good work of superseding the un-
reliable “Gent One” as a guardian of the estate of the
old man who has passed away and caretaker for the widow
and the bereaved offspring. It has now £2,424,000 of trust-
money on hand and carefully invested, and as security for
the due repayment thereof it has an uncalled capital of
£975,000, a paid-up capital of £25,000, and a reserve of
£2500. As no legal person that The Bulletin ever heard
of has £1,002,600 of capital and reserves that his clients
can fall back upon to make good the deficiency if their
money is misapplied, the advantages of such a concern
are obvious. The co’s own little commission has enabled
it this year to pay a dividend of 6 per cent., to add £lOOO
to reserve, and have a little over to carry forward. Tiie
Bulletin doesn’t recommend this co. as offering absolute
security, for no security is absolute, but as an improve-
ment on the lawyer, or the pious relation, or the strictly
upright friend, it does recommend it highly.
The directors of the City of Melb. Bank are to
be examined in court as to the doings of their dreadfully-
decomposed institution. The directors of another gamey
concern of the same order were examined in the same
fashion a good while ago, but, though some very tough
revelations were the result, nothing whatever resulted
except a lot of expenses, a good part of which came out
of the scanty assets. Supposing anything really nasty
comes to light this time, does the Government intend
that anything shall come of it? For, if it doesn’t, then
the examination is mere foolishness, and waste of good
money, and needless stench, and another advt. of the im-
potence of Victorian law.
After another year of hard competition, the
Mercantile Mutual Fire Insurance Co. shows a profit of
£8765. The shareholders get 10 per cent. (£1875); a sum
of £6603 goes as bonus to be divided between shareholders
and policy-holders; £lOOO is allotted to provide for
shrinkage' in the value of securities ; and as these
amounts total £9478 the previous credit balance is re-
duced by £714. The profit is £3300 less than in 1893, and
£2BOO less than in 1894. In the latter year the Mercantile
Mutual, having a large sum on hand, proceeded to have a
real good time, and in addition to the ordinary dividend
and bonus—which reach something over 23 per cent.—it
declared a special bonus of 20 per cent., and “ blewed not
only the year’s profits but £874 of the previous year s
balance. And now that the profits have shrunk a lot,
and the interest on investments has dropped in two years
from £2332 to £i7B3, and some of the principal has dis-
appeared as well in the general depreciation of things and
has to be replaced out of profits, there seems very little
justification for that festive proceeding of the year before
last The Mercantile Mutual’s balance-sheet, by the way,
keeps strictly dark as to the nature of the investments
(£67,760 in all) which represent the whole of its capital and
reserve-fund. All it says is that they are “ Investments,
£67,760,” but as they now only yield £2 13s. per cent,
interest on their nominal value, it looks as if they might
possibly want to be written down considerably.

The unfortunate Assets Realisation Co. (Syd-
ney) still struggles unsuccessfully to realise its own
assets. The revenue for the year, apart from calls on
shareholders, was £1676, and the outlay £8490, leaving a
loss of £6814. Last year the loss was £5444, so things are
not improving. A concern whose expenditure is five
times its income is in the worst kind of a bad way, and
the best feature about it is that the shareholders are
paying up manfully, and have wiped off £19,000 of lia-
bilities during the year. v
* * * *
The Southern Insurance Co. (Melb.) has made
a net profit for the half-year of £1689, and as it pays
a div. at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum, which absorbs
£2500, its previous credit balance is reduced by £Bll.
Last half the Southern made a loss of £1393, and yet paid
a 10 per cent, dividend, thus swelling .the deficiency to
£3893 ; and even for a big co. with £50,000 capital and
£76,000 reserves this looks rather reckless. Also, the
interest from investments has fallen in 18 months from
£2791 to £2089, which is another good reason for going
slow.

People badly want to know if a certain poli-
tician’s alleged overdraft was one of the-M.L. Colonial
Bank’s securities which were taken over when that con-

immense affair, and that it was one reason why the
Colonial Bank used to grit its teeth so much in its sleep.

A weird concern called the Adelaide Live Stock
Insurance Co. was recently fined £lOO for not furnishing

Said co. is in 1000 shares ; the manager holds 996, and
four other people hold one each. All fiVe are directors.
The accountant had no hooks, or couldn’t find them, or

Melb. Tramway Co. had a further falling off in
its revenue for ’95, it being £2831 less than that for the
disastrous year ’94. During the last six months, how-
ever, another £6901 was ground off the expenses, so the
5 per cent, dividend is again forthcoming. Melb. Tram-
way Co. is in a fair way to become known as the champion
grinder of Victoria.

Vic. imports for ’95 were «£4BO less, and exports

The softgoods business of George Webster and

can’t have lost much by this rather old-established con-
cern, taking one consideration with another. The writer
remembers the original G. W. long ago as a man who lived
right up to his Australian income at ’Ome. Quite a
heavy commercial “ swell,” driving his mail phaeton and
pair in Hyde Park every afternoon during the season.
The Australian wholesale rag-trade has been run con-
siderably for the profit of Great Britain, both, in a com-
mercial and social sense. Arrogant old Banks was the
high sheriff of Cumberland, or something of that sort,
and Macarthur was a Lord Mayor in his time. And not
so long ago one heard the calico jimmies mentioning in
an awe-struck whisper that Paterson (of Paterson, Laing
and Bruce) had positively come out from Hingland to
look at his milch cow.

Junction (8.H.) pays another dividend in
February.
Junction North and Junction have now “ holed
through” on the western sulphide development. The
vein contracts considerably as it nears the Junction
North, but its course is shown to be less southerly than
the B.H. North people had hoped for. The stuff right up
to the Junction North boundary is rich, friable sulphides.
The official reports concerning the Central
(B H.) now appear under the heading “ Sulphide Corpora-
tion (Ashcroft’s process) Limited.” Only a little work is
being done in the mine, and most of the best sulphides
and a large proportion of the second-grade sulphides are
being stacked underground or on the surface against the
time when the co. will get its own plant going. About
400 tons of second-grade ore goes to Block 14 and the Dry
Creek works weekly ; and so the manager’s hand is kept
out of the new co.’s pocket.
B.H. Proprietary people are very little satisfied
with the results from sulphide-concentration. The cost
per ton has been cut down, but the loss of nietal is
mortifying. In consequence of this the co. has just
shipped to “certain metallurgical works ” 500 tons of
sulphides for experimental purposes ; said “ certain
works ” are understood to be Ashcroft’s, near London,
where some excellent results have been got lately.
The lead-market, which firmed at the end of
last year, after hanging fire for months, is perceptibly
weakening again. This is worse news for B.H. South
than for any other mine at the Hill. Its output is now
about 1200 tons of ore weekly, yielding 360 tons concen-
trates, assaying about 70 per cent. lead. Still, the South
ought to be paying small divs.; months ago it was under-
stood to be on the right side of the book.

The Cremorne coal people are in a bad way
over the refusal to give them a deep-water lease on
Sydney Harbor. They rave about repudiation, but
Premier Reid says he can find no record of a lease or
even the promise of one. The statements made in the
prospectus constitute the impending trouble. Are the
people who put up the £200,000 to work coal at 3000 ft. on
the “ beautiful harbor ” aware that only two bores have
been put down, one in burnt coal; the other some distance
away in marketable coal; that the first bore proves a
dyke which, so far as anybody knows, may run up to
within 10 yards of the good bore : and that it will cost less
to put down half-a-dozen other bores to locate the good
ana bad coal than to sink a shaft one-third the required
distance? The co. will be foolish if it does not do more
boring and more definitely locate its coal.

One of the most instructive chapters in the his-
tory of Vic. mining is provided by recent disclosures in
connection with the Rothschild Gold-mining Co., of
which Minister Peacock has the misfortune to be manager.
Recent investigations have led to the discovery that,
although there are but 10,000 good shares in the co.,
17,000 more are knocking round, and many thousands are
in existence that nobody can account for. In fact, it
would appear that any man who felt he would like to own
some Rothschild’s scrip went right away and had a few
hundreds or thousands printed “ on his own,” and subse-
quently those bogus shares got so mixed up with the
genuine article that nobody can separate them. The
auditors point out that many shares have been issued
three or four times over, and new shares have been issued
without any cancellations. Also, small parcels of shares
have been converted into big ones, and much cash has
gone astray, and nobody seems to know anything about
anything, and the books are large, concrete masses of
bewildering ignorance, and the spirit of misrule sits gib-
bering at the bottom of the shaft, if the bottom of the
shaft has not been mislaid. The Bulletin has an idea
that the drives have all got tangled, and the mine has got
turned upside down, so that the shaft is sticking up in the
air 700 ft., and the poppet-legs are down where the well
ought to be. However, the directors have been em-
powered to take civil or criminal proceedings against any
person or persons whom they may be advised are liable.

would cost £25,000 to sink a new shaft, and the share-
holders don’t feel inclined to find that sum, this erstwhile
div.-payer will go under.

Another gold-producing mine opened up at Mt.
Wills, Vic. —the Anaconda. Last crushing, 228 tons for
6850 z. This is the third crushing averaging over 3oz. per
ton.

On figures, Vic., and not S.A., has the big grip
of the W. A. trade. In ’92, Vic.’s shipments West stood at
£371,829, and in ’94, £842,920 ; and S.A. at £246,841 and
£473,680 respectively. For the same years, W.A.’s export
to Vic. rose from £333,323 to £755,553, while to S.A. the
figures show a decrease from £392,372 to £316,532. The
N.S.W. trade apparently only reaches about £lOO,OOO each
way. So Vic. is happy.
Dr. Sehmeisser had, beyond doubt, cabled to
C. A. Moreing, of London, mining-promoter, a damnable
report on Block “ 45 ” Hampton Plains Co. But
Moreing was (as reported) quite equal to the
occasion. Listen : “ Now, gentlemen, Dr. Sehmeisser
usually only reports on developed mines. He
is not a prospector or explorer. He has cabled me that
there are numerous reefs outcropping upon the block.
(Applause.) Of course the outcrops of these reefs are of
low grade. (Why of course?) Still, he found gold in
many of them, and he particularises one reef which has,
he says, the appearance of being very valuable, and he
recommends the vigorous exploration of that reef. Con-
sidering that this opinion is the result of a cursory ride
around the block, I think that we may rest satisfied that
this opinion is exceedingly encouraging. (Cheers).”
Hooray for J. Bull, who often isn’t a bull at all, but only
a milch cow.

Westralian gold-export for December was
17,8900 z., valued at £67,9B2—increase for the month,
23820 z. The year’s export was 231,5120 z.; value, £879,748
—increase, £24,381. This brings the total for 10 years to
686,3610 z. Coolgardie, for the year, contributed
125,1050 z. ; the Murchison, 65,4770 z.; Yilgarn, 19,7470 z.,
and Pilbarra, 19,5220 z. Westralian papers are content to
be mildly enthusiastic over these figures. It, is apologised
that the fields are “ developing” rather than producing.
The pockets of investors are yet Westralia’s most profit-
able goldfield.

Tasmania’s yield is officially given in two
amounts, viz., 54,9640 z. and 59,9640 z. ; the latter is pro-
bably the one intended. The silver ore produced for the
year is reckoned at 20,553 tons (value, £246,636), as
against 20,572 tons in ’94.
London bucket-shop rags are yelling “ buy Big
Blows !” But the public “ aren’t ’aving any’’—want to
hear the battery talk first. Blows had a welcome rise to
£2, but just as quickly slumped to 10s. One Westralian
promoter unloaded a lot at best rates.
In 1886 W.A. produced 3020 z. gold ; in 1891 the
yield had grown to 30,3110 z. The progression thereafter
was 59,548, 110,890, 207,131; for 1895 the yield was 231,513.
Compare this with Victoria’s early days, when 10 times
more was got with 10 times less fuss—or compare it with
Victoria to-day, when three times more is got with no fuss
at all i

Dundas (W.A.) news: “Prospecting is being
carried on in the vicinity of M'Pherson’s South
Dundas. Should this country prove payable, it will mean
a nice little tract of 200 sq. miles of auriferous country.”
A paper has started down there, also a brewery. We
could have guessed it.
Sydney D.T. wire: “ The Golden Age repre-
sentative has just returned from the immense formation
west of the Black Flag. He fully confirms the previous
accounts of the lode.‘ It is 10 chains wide, and can be
traced for five miles, though he does not say it is so big or
so rich all the way as on the Duke of Wellington lease.
Certified assays of the stone at 66ft. go from 12dwt. to
187203. to the ton. Mr. G. H. Kingswell has secured a
block adjoining the prospectors’ claim for a Newcastle
syndicate.” We are sorry for the poor, knocked-out
Boulder. A reef 666 ft. wide (666 is the number of the
Beast in Revelations), and already five miles long, should
cheapen mines in the Boulder country. Twelve dwts. is
not much, but what about certified assays of 18720 z. ? It
must have been a lovely specimen, and the man who
destroyed it merely for the purpose of getting an assay
ought to be kicked to death. By the by, a Mr. Kingswell
recently left the Newcastle (N.S.W.) press to take a simi-
lar billet at Coolgardie.
* * » *
“ Rich stone has been struck in the Fremantle
mine at the 25-Mile, W.A., and splendid specimens are
being exhibited in Coolgardie.” Quite so, but what has
become of all the other mines that at one time or another
have been on rich stone and exhibited specimens? At
least 500 have been so reported. They have gone where
all the W.A. good mines seem to go —duffered-out.

The W.A. Mines Minister has upheld the
warden’s decision in favor of the jumpers of the Great
Dundas lease at Dundas. It is next to Mawson’s Reward
—another mine which only wants gold to make it pay.
Both are owned in London, where most sick mines go.
* * * *
A cheerful wire for J. Bull, Esq.—“ The original
plaint for the forfeiture of the Great Boulder mine has
been withdrawn, and another one has been substituted.”
If J. Bull only knew what fiendish appetites some of the
W.A. Govt. Departments have for palm-grease, a little
message like that would make him snort.

The burly Bissenberger is leaving Coolgardie for
London with a bagful of White Feather, I O U, and other
mines. He is one of the pioneers of the White Feather.
If there is another boom in London he will be right in it;
if not, Bissenberger will want to know the reason why.
The cornet is a noiseless instrument compared to his
voice, and a camel’s kick is preferable to being in the way
of Bissenberger’s shoulders when he is working his way

' Francis Hart has been doing the Coolgardie
fields for the West Australian. He says of the Wealth
of Expectations : “I was allowed the rare and special
privilege of inspecting the Wealth of Nations mine, not
previously extended to any 7 pressman.” Steward ! He
also speaks of the kindness of Mr. Kaufman, and of how
comfortable his stay was made. According to this newly-
fledged mining-expert there are 2000 tons of stone at
grass, and a reef from 6 to 26ft. wide, also a band of talc
of extraordinary richness. There is also a capital of
£250,000 to pay divs. on.

For the official reports of many W.A. mines
owned in London you have ,to wait for London papers.
Londonderry, Nov. 5.—“ Crushed during the fortnight 82
tons for 151 oz. melted gold.” The finders once dollied
25 cwt. for over 4000 oz. Big Blow, Dec. 6. —“ Manager
hopes to begin crushing about the middle of January.”
“ Dr: Schmeisser reports to the London and Western
Australian Investment Corporation that Lady Shenton,
Friday, and Crusoe are the most developed mines, and
have inspired the professor with a favorable opinion of
their value.” A faint report maketh the London share-
holder’s heart grow sick.

fork out £9OOO for machinery freightage from Fremantle
to the mine.

Brilliant G.M. Co., Charters Towers, has, to
date, produced 190,1970 z. gold from 148,168 tons quartz,
and paid in divs. £303,416. Tonnage in sight, 73,000. or
three years’ work without sinking or driving a foot. Most
of the crushing is done with Huntingdon mills, and sc
well that a shilling a ton was the best offer recently made
for the tailings.
* * * *
Out of the total gold-yield for the Central Q.
District, 128,7000 z. are due to Mt. Morgan and 32620 z. to
other mines. Of smaller mines, Mt. Usher (Crocodile) is
the best, returning 3690 z. for 115 tons. In the same
neighborhood Struck Oil p.c. yields 120 oz. for 112 tons—a
great falling-off from ’94, when 81 tons produced 3620 z.
The Ulam field shows a marked decline both in the num-
ber of claims and the total output. The Queenslander
United turned out 480 oz. from 421 tons. Cawarral is
greatly improved, returning 4120 z. in ’95, against one-
eighth of that amount for the previous year.

It is declared that one good cricketer was
excluded from the Australian Eleven because he
picks his teeth with his fork, and the high reputa-
tion of Australia must be maintained. What
would the British investor say ?
Dr. G. H. Taylor, of the Sydney Coast
Hospital and Leper Lazaret, is strongly of opinion
that nerve-leprosy is far commoner in Australia
than supposed. In this last two years he has
found among Coast Hospital patients at least 30
who showed anaesthesia (loss of sense of touch) and
analgesia (loss of sense of pain) in the skin sup-
plied by certain nerves which were thickened and
tender. These he believes to have been cases of
nerve-leprosy in a very early stage. Also in three
persons who had died after long and exhausting
illnesses, but had never shown any other sus-
piciously-leprous symptom than the above, which
symptom is always present in leprosy but is not
an absolute proof by itself of leprosv. Dr. Tavlor
found leprosy-bacilli in the spleen.' The doctor
asks medical men, especially those in charge of
public institutions, to help him in his enquiries.

Dear Bulletin, —“ Query's " letter in a
recent Bulletin' re a Queensland leper who had
no suspicion of the nature of his ailment until
informed by a chance Chinaman who refused to
take his money, with the remark, “ Your money
no good ; you leper, " does not ring true. As a
matter of fact, the Chow is strangely indifferent
in his dealings with the leper, and"will not go five
yards out of his way to report a case. In a recent
Melb. instance, Chinese worked side by side in a
laundry with an obvious leper far gone in the
disease, and the sufferer was only discovered by
the authorities by chance. As for refusing a
leper's money, I have an idea that the average
Chinaman would fight a leper to a finish for an
< ighteenpenny debt.— Sxell.

Mrs. Andrews's neat and feminine address
on the man r. woman subject, at Melb. Athenaeum
Hall, gets solemnly ridiculed by the local blue-
stocking publication. This lecture, like a previous
one from the same attractive little lady, had the
audacity to please the general public. It arrived
at a good many wise conclusions by illogical
routes, and didn't confine itself strictly to the
truth when a probaht- bcv would serve the pur-
pose in view. The tli o- . that a wise woman is a
valuable item of society, whether she votes or
otherwise, ran right through Mrs. Andrews's dis-
course, and gave complete satisfaction to every-
body except the female who is haunted by a sense
of her own darned unpleasantness.

Mrs. Andrews, lecturing on “ Men, Women, and Dress."
said, as a preliminary soother to the males in her audi-
ence. that with some regulation of weight and color,
according to times and seasons, man’s dress would be
perfection. Then the wrench came. Men, she continued,
were really more slaves to fashion than women. No
man would dare to introduce a more suitable dress than
broadcloth for our oppressive climate - whereas woman
would modify a fashion as they thought fit. 1 ndeed 1
What journalism has come to in Australia.
The other day two of the few remaining members
of the staff of a certain Australian dailv arrived
from some office engagement drenched to the skin.
The managing proprietor expressed surprise that
they had not “ trammed ” it, but was met by the
retort that they could not afford trams out of their
meagre salaries, and that the office allowed no
expenses. “ Always keep a shilling in your
pocket for trams,"said the enterprisingpro-
prietor, “ a shilling of your own. you know,
and be independent of the office.”
“ The dawn of a brighter day for Aus-
tralian literature is breaking fast.” Contributions
to the Christmas supplement of a '‘great ” Sydney
paper published every day w ere paid at the'sand-
shifting rate “ of ss. a column and find their own
ink and paper.”
In the last chequered day< of a lately-defunct
Sydney journal pay-day for the employes was a
dreary void: in some cases, this hardship was
mitigated bv small advances from the till on the
worker’s 1.0. U. One man, on the plea of a coming
addition to his family, even drew as much as k. 2.
By a strange coincidence, in less than a month 1.
members of the limited staff also found their w i\es
in an interesting condition, and nothing but the
sudden collapse of the paper prevented the nffice-
bov from being the father of twins.

It is declared by certain energetic “re-

girls who walk about Melbourne, “ inducing young

bring them under the Lunacy Act. Now, the

be held, by some people, to come very much
under the Act. The average Christian worker

O, pretty Mrs. A. !
O, piquant Mrs. Andrews !
These statements were, now say,
A lady’s platform grand ruse !
You knew, fair lecturess,
Though they should first look chilly,
By praising up men’s dress,
You’d knock the poor things silly.
But in your heart, confess !
Though they, sweet apes, smile smugly
To hear your praise—men’s dress
Is hideously ugly.
They know this, too, themselves ;
Their clothes, they hate and loathe them,
But—miserable elves !
They let their women clothe them.
Just give them half a chance !
They are no self-erasers—
At tennis see them pranc-
In rainbow-colored bl; zers.
They yearn a dash to cut —
To join some gaudy Order,
And in regalia strut,
With tassels on its border.
Your military swells—
The sort that Britain peddles
To us —how like tin-bells
The jingling of their medals !

The days of cap and feather

There were over 30 cases of typhoid fever
in Adelaide hospital at the end of ‘Jan., and the
number was daily increasing.
* * * *
On Thursday, Jan. 23, the thermometer
readings in Adelaide were :—Shade, 111 '2deg. ;
Sun, I72deg. The highest shade heat ever regis-
tered in that city was 116.3 deg., on Jan. 20, 1858.
The highest sun reading was 180 deg., on Jan. 18,
1882. Only five times in the history of the
Meteorological Department has the recent shade
heat been exceeded.
* * * *
From Jan. 1 to Jan. 26 the thermometer
in the shade read, at a homestead only 30 yards
from the Darling River :—ll2, 107, 112,' 114,’ 118,
121, 123, 118, 118, 115, 114, 124, 117, 121, 1 0, 128,
128, 124, 129, 126, 120, 126, 129, 119. This was up
to Jan. 25. Next day the wind changed from
west to south, and the glass fell to 98.

The N.S.W. diseased-meat difficulty, how-
ever troublesome to the auctioneers fined for
having more or less innocently sold beasts which,
on being slaughtered, proved to be diseased, will
in the long run prove a blessing to the public.
The frequency of police-court proceedings will
educate the community as to the hideous risks run
from the communication of tuberculosis, and will
lead to effectual legislation on the subject.

At the haggis supper held in connection
with the Burns anniversary at Quong Tart’s
rooms, Sydney, the other evening, a new ingredient
was added to the smellful Scotch dish. Tomatoes
were said to improve the flavor considerably. Ye

It is wired from Westralia that when
unfortunate jockey Trewartha had his skull frac-
tured on Perth course, the Governor offered his
carriage to take him home, but as there was a new
ambulance waggon on the course for the first time
the carriage was not required. His Ex. is a cousin
of Baron Carington, onee of Sydney, and this
carriage business reminds us of old times, when
the Yawning one had bashed footballers carted off
the gory field of battle in the gubernatorial shay.

At the Melb. A.N.A. banquet one man
only, when the speeches were about to begin,
ignored the presence of Lady Brassey and began
to smoke. Let his moral courage excuse the breach
of etiquette. He was as brave as the private
soldier who follows his own inclination by running
away from the battle. Here’s to him :
A big meeting of Freemasons is called for
50th inst. at Hobart to elect a successor to departed
brother Giblin, formerly G.M. of the Order. By
the same post as the circular calling the meeting,
comes to every prominent brother an elaborately-
printed invitation to a gorgeous gorge at the resi-
dence of the Pro. Grand Master, also in Hobart.
The sequel is to show that Freemasonry is mostly
stomach, if nothing goes wrong with the works.
An Australian Protestant newspaper
alleges that great conventual institutions on this
continent are built with money loaned, almost
or entirely without interest, from Spain, Italy and
other countries, where such institutions have been
suppressed.

Dear Bulletin, —One Sydney tobacconist
was fined the other day for keeping his shop open
on Sunday. One !—yet throughout Sydney and
suburbs scores of tobacconists keep open all day
Sunday. Why not fine the lot ? or compel the lot
to close ? lam a barber myself, and I work from
8 a.m. till 9 p.m. daily (until 11 p.m. on Satur-
day), for £1 a week. In addition, I work every
Sunday morning, from 8 till 11, for the con-
venience of a few customers and a few policemen,
who say they have no time to get shaved on
Saturday. Thus the police punish one man for
breaking the law, and assist another to break it.
But then, you see, my boss is an old resident in
Lie suburb, and is police-privileged to do as he
pleases.-—Mug.

A Pen bridge prisoner the other day played
a practical joke on a prominent prison official, and
was rewarded with three days’ solitary. He
gravely informed the -potentate that he, the
prisoner, wasa miracle-worker, and, in proof of the

noon’s evening paper. He had picked it out of

Be the suicide of a young woman at Bal-
larat, a few weeks back, there was a point which
magistrates in general might as well make a note
of. The suicide left a letter behind her. “I am
the mother of a child, as you all know. Although
I blamed a certain young man of being the father
of it, I must now confess he has nothing to do
with it.” She kept the name of the real father to
herself, and was a very fair specimen of a true
woman. Therefore, she was an unscrupulous liar
Yvhere her illegitimate baby was concerned.

The other day, on a
Melb. street-car dummy,
a countryman with a
bag, and a flowing beard
like those they wear
“ way up in Ironbark,”
asked a young barrister
for a match. The lawyer
handed him his silver
match-box, a trick one
which had been given to
him by a friend, and
turned to talk to a
brother shark on his
other side. Noticing the
countryman fumbling
with the box the bar-
rister opened it, with
the remark, “ It’s very
simple—see ! ” and then
closed it again, adding,
“ Now can you do it ? ”
“I’m d d if you do,”
roared the countryman,
clutching his bag. “ Hi,
mister, stop the tram ! ”
and, before it came to a
standstill, he was flying
up Queen-st. as hard as
he could go, casting fur-
tive looks behind him to
see whether the clean-
shaven stranger was on
his track. The gripman,
grinning like a native
cat, explained, “ He’s
been readin’ the papers,
sir, and he thinks you
want to work the match-
box trick on him ! ”
Then the barrister
smiled sadly. The fact
that a legal practitioner
might easily be mis-
taken for a spieler had
never struck him before.

Sydney policeman to reporter at suburban

The raspberry-pickers of Waudin (Vic.)
and neighborhoods re a caste in a small way. On
the whole, their features, head, stature, bearing
are so much of the one type that one can single
them out in a crowd. They have a slang of their
own, traditions, modes of dress, songs (with abun-
dant local references and often of an unprintably
amorous character). They have an unspeakable
detestation of “ toffs ” and toffery, male and
female, in every shape and form. The collar is an
especial abomination. They boycott intruders by
means of an ingenious system of “ barrack,” which
soon produces either conformity or a quiet dis-
appearance. Compositors, it seems, make the
best raspberry-pickers, but there are only odd
stragglers at the game.

A Melb. soft-goody, asked by his girls for
more wages the other day, gave them hymnbooks.
In solemn silence will we booze
A toast to him who sat amid
A mighty crowd and wouldn’t choose
To do as all the others did.
Unwillingly they seemed “ polite ” :
They cursed their luck or feebly joked,
Whilst one true hero struck a light
And smoked.
Drink to the man who struck a match
When came the time for speeches drear,
Daring an hour of bliss to snatch,
And shaming all his comrades near.
Those craven spirits, old or young,
Conversed in timid tones and soaked.
Honor the One who held his tongue
And smoked.
TWO SIDES.
Stitch, stitch, stitch, morning, and noon and night,
(What the hang do I care, if I get my cheap pants
all right ?)
Till my heart is sick and faint, weary and dim my
eyes ;
(O, George, you really should see those twopenny-
halfpenny ties !)
My child is dying. And yet they say that God is
a God of Love.
(I really expect six buttons on a one and three-
penny glove !)
’Tis hell to live. Let her die; whether Death
means Nothing or Heaven !
(I don’t care, so long as my shirt doesn’t cost more
than two and eleven !)

Play (W.A.): The Bulletin has nothing to recall re
Dean. Dean was originally convicted after a foul, not a
fair trial, and his conviction was not warranted by the
evidence. The public and Parliament and the Govt, (not
merely The Bulletin) concurred in this view, and the
case was re-heard by an independent commission, which
decided that there was no evidence to convict. So Dean
was released. The fact that he afterwards confessed his
guilt is no argument. (2) There is no present evidence to
show* that the Westralian gold-boom is warranted—in
fact, there is plenty to show- that it is utterly unwarranted,
as regards most of the alleged mines involved. (3) The
fact that one or two doubtful mines unexpectedly turned
out rich, no more vindicates the present mad W.A. boom
than Dean’s confession vindicates the methods of his
original trial. .Thomas A. Sisley : Please send address...

The Freetrade
Policy to which N.S.W. has recently reverted ha
proved more than a nine days’ topic in the com
mercial circles of Melbourne, and many specula
tions are made as to how the new order will affect
intercolonial trade in the immediate future. While
there is a consensus of opinion that the non-
restrictive policy will to some extent benefit
Sydney at the expense of Melbourne, there are
isolated facts which point in quite the contrary
direction. For example : Messrs. Manning and
Company, the popular ladies’ outfitters, of Collins-
street, Melb., have always had considerable busi-
ness transactions with the mother colony, but,
since the New Year, their orders from N.S.W. for
Costumes, Cloaks, and Millinery have been far
larger than usual. A drawback refund of duty is
obtained from Vic. Customs House, and credited
to the buyer by Manning and Co., so that buyers
across the borders get their purchases duty free.
*Thus, if it were not for the trouble occasioned by
the narrower policy of the southern province,
Melb. merchants should find the Freetrade pro-
gramme of N.S.W. very much to their advantage.
Howbeit, Messrs. Manning and Co. are sanguine
of now largely extending their business Avith the
ladies of N.S.W., who think, rightly or wrongly,
that Melb. modes are always in advance of those
of Sydney. Ladies !—Write to Manning and Co.,

Lower the Rates.
t( Most readers will agree with me in saying,
Yes ; lower the rates ; whether it be poor-rates,
municipal-rates, or parochial-rates, show me the
way to lower them and I will quickly adopt it! ”
If this eagerness to lessen financial expense—
general rates is so universal, what must it be
when the death-rate is considered ? Surely no
one would neglect any reasonable chance of lessen-
ing the danger of disease—to lower the death-rate.
Any means ; any agent; any suggestion should
be welcomed by all. Still, there is surprising
apathy on the part of some on this very question.
Mere we have at hand, within reach of every in-
habitant of every town and city in Australia, a
means, a remedy—Warner’s Safe Cure—which has
been adopted and tried by thousands, where its
timely use has lowered the death-rate and reduced
the invalid list; but, strange to say, many are
ailing to-day, who hesitate adopting or trying this
safe and sure remedy in the face of this proof ; in

Sydney, February 4, 1896.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
From Melbourne I have received a pair of bari
cone songs by Alex. Law —“King of the Woods 1
and “ Alone at the Wheel.” The first is a cheer
ful chant illustrative of the regal joys of timber
getting (with the chances of a big tree falling on
you carefully omitted), and >it is not, like Mr
Law’s second attempt, reminiscent of anybody
else’s ideas. But “ Alone at the Wheel ” has one
phrase which is note for note with the phrase in
“ Let Me Love Thee ; ” also the words embody
the fact that whoever was alone at the wheel (anc
I never heard of steersmen going in pairs like
police in dangerous neighborhoods) ought certainly
not to have been there, as in the end he wreckec
the ship and sent all his “ comrades leal ” to Davy
Jones’s locker. A composer who can twine bor-
rowed melodies round a person like that will pro-
bably annex a fugue to glorify a stockbroker.
As New Year’s Day and the braw Scots wrecked
poor Gov. Duff in a popular sense, so do Anniver-
sary Day and\the Tasmanian aquatic men explode
what little public sentiment there was left for
Gov. “ Gourmandston ” in the Tight Little Jam-
pot. Owing to H.E.’s refusal to donate a stiver
to the funds of the regatta the committee got
nasty, and omitted to invite the viceroy; and,
therefore, eventuated the terrible spectacle, never
before seen in “Tassy,” of a regatta without a
Governor. And, what is worse (from a society
standpoint), the affair passed off most success-
fully. Gov. G. is evidently a man of nerve. In
accepting the Governorship at a salary much
lower than that enjoyed by previous Governors he
announced that he intended to spend not one cent
in excess of his official salary. And a bargain is a
bargain.
However, I don’t suppose the fat and sleepy
viscount minds missing a regatta very much—it
merely meant a day off the chain for His Ex., who
evidently doesn’t take the V.R. position to heart
as the retrenched Brassey and Hampden do.
By the way, the rule that cheapness is the synonym
for inferiority doesn’t hold good if applied to the
blasd Hampden, who, on a much-reduced stipend,
does all those things that his fully-paid-up prede-
cessors did. I wonder if the crowd of people who
are always soliciting vice-regal patronage and very
seldom failing to get it, even when it means a
long, dusty journey to open a pump—l wonder if
these people ever remember that his graceful and
amiable Excellency is a bit of a job-lot and might
occasionally be allowed to act as “ sich ? ”
The threat of Admiral Bridge to keep his
officers and men hard at work and no afternoon
teas permitted appears to be holding good at
Hobart, where the squadron’s only relaxation to
date has been a more or less eventful regatta.
Hobart girls are all on pins and needles waiting
for smoke-oh and the release of the gallant officers
—which may never occur. For the Admiral is a
misogynist who protects his staff from petticoat
danger as a hen protects her chickens from hawks.
When the fleet was off Fremantle (W.A.) last
Nov., a maiden adopted rather a cruel device to
draw attention to the fact that she had a blue-
blooded sailor-cousin in the fo’castle who ought to
be on the quarter-deck. She wrote a poem of wel-
come to Real Admiral Bridge, which would have
the effect of getting her sailor-cousin six months in
irpns as an accessory after the fact if the Admiral
had any literary instincts —“There’s a sailor lad
among you, ” warbled the W. A. poetess in a lilt that
runs as smoothly as a cart-load of bricks bolting
downstairs “ who bears a proud old name. ” And
whose ancestors it appears “ Gave up vast posses-
sions
Bartered life and liberty,
And all for England’s glory,
The army and the navy.
But surely the poetess oould find a rhyme for
navy ? —Bartered life and gravy, for instance,
would ring better and still be a fair description of
what probably took place. However, the news
that the flagship has a real Jive aristocrat swab-
bing decks will probably divert society’s attention
from the quarter-de ck for awhile. Jack Tar may
now expect to be graciously “ thank-you’d ” for
hauling beauty over the gunwale.
Visitors to Sydney Centennial Park can’t help
contrasting the hard-faced, careworn-looking lady-
cyclists with their wobbling wheels and rounded
shoulders “ scorching ” along the asphalt with th«
equestriennes who caracole over the grass. It is
really a treat to see a good figure on a smart-look-
ing neddy after these swarms of exhausted-looking
wheel-women who always seem as if they ought to
have their tongues hanging out. The equestrienne
is the poetry, the cyclist the prose of physical
exercise—and don’t let women forget it.
A recently-ennobled Australasienne has certain
little “ oddnesses ” that fully qualify her to hold
her own with various other “ladyships” one can
easily call to mind. At a fashionable water-party
the lady’s remarks that the “ pertaters were sure
to be good, as she had superintended the bilin’ of
’em ’erself ” won her lasting fame, only made more
sure by her breezy remark at a function at her
private residence later on. When the festivities
were in full blast the hostess rushed into the
drawing-room and flopped into a vacant chair with
loud expressions of gratitude—audibly remarking
that it was the first time that day she had sat on
her blessed hunkers. Her prize utterance, however,
occurred at a Govmentouse dinner-party at which
pickled onions put in an appearance. The lady
refused them at first, but seeing her husband
delving into the jar she changed her mind. “ You
can pass me them pickles, Sir Blank,” she said to
the host; “I see me ’usband’s eatin’ ’em, so if 1
don’t he’ll stink me out of the ’ouse. ”
Queer things do happen at vice-regal dinner-
parties. At Sydney Govmentouse during the
Acting-Governor’s last reign, the Premier —who is
constantly being held up in the street by beggars,
and so always carries a hoard of soup-tickets—
drew out his pocket-handkerchief, when some-
thing fell to the ground. A naval man next him
stooped and picked it up, and placed it face-up-
wards on the table, and a broad smile went round
when it was seen to be a soup-ticket. However,
it might have been worse —it might have been a
pawn-ticket instead, and probably would have
been had the accident happened to several other
politicians. N.B. —The beauty of this yarn is
that when it attaches itself to a certain other poli-
tician the dropped soup-ticket may be metamor-
phosed into a writ.
“The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith,” at Sydney
Lyceum, threw a horrible light on the morals of a
first-night audience, who seemed scarcely in touch
with the dramatist’s fundamental idea of reforma-
tion, judging by the enthusiastic manner in which
they cheered when Agnes overcame her scruples
about acting as a toy, and, shedding the autumn-
leaf garment she begins with, likewise the ash-
colored robe, came out in the third act in what
would have been a screamer half-a-dozen years
ago. Just now, however, a plain bodice and skirt
of chocolate-colored silk spangled with gold, the
train edged with pink roses, the bodice very decol-
lete with bead shoulder-straps and strands of
beads falling to the elbow and clanking like
chains—is a sort of fashionable back num-
ber. It is Mrs. Ebbsmith’s only relapse
into the possibly-becoming, too, so it seems
a pity Mrs. Brough hadn’t a more up-to-
date turn-out to play her “ hour ” in—although,
mind you, her really charming frock looked a very
probable purchase for “Mr. Gleeve ” to make,
since men are much more artistic than women
and, therefore, less likely to be led by fashion than
we are.
Mrs. Brough played out the last act in poor-
looking black and a broken-hearted bonnet, just
like the Family Herald governess wears when
she’s hunting for a job. And, apropos of the last
act, with its promise of a pious, flannel-petticoat-
making, tract-distributing middle age for the
heroine (who is rather too talkee-talkee to become
a great stage-favorite people don’t go to the
theatre to be lectured), I fancy it throws a side-
light on Sydney morals that several women were
heard expressing their dissatisfaction at the way
the problem terminates. Evidently society would
prefer a more human ending to the tragedy—
which, by the way, is the only play in my reper-
toire in which the heroine talks with relish of
going out and banging the street-door after her.
Once upon a time the privilege of jamming his hat
over his eyes and slamming the front-door was
one of the prized prerogatives of Man, and his
way out of most matrimonial arguments, but, if
women take to slamming ’em too, Honeymoon
Cottage will have to be built with two front-doors,
to meet the demand.
Miss Beryl Faber wears a black and white
checked silk with a Hamlet hat (it’s stylish, but we
are just about tired of the magpie blend, though
this, of course, is mourning) for four solid acts and
makes the cruellest remark in the play. “ Hus-
bands ! They’re everywhere! ” she says. And yet
a look round the d.c., where sit society belles of
almost countless seasons who still write their
father’s names on their visiting-cards, makes Miss
Faber’s statement look as if it wanted a pinch of
salt. Hilda Spong was the wife, and looked hand-
some in black brocade with a black seal coat
edged with deep furs and lined with yellow satin
—a black spot veil over head and face a la
Olga Nethersole in “The Profligate.” ‘ The
Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith ” is rather sombrely
dressed all through—it is an incurably dismal
play, and cheerful colorings would hinder the
actors from piling up the woe I suppose.
There was a full house for the premiere, cack-
ling like a duck-pond, as usual, and with new
.additions to the hubbub in the shape of several
women with heavily-starched petticoats on that
rustled and crackled like newspapers every time
they moved ; and as they all went diving after
dropped articles every 10 minutes or so the noise
their underclothing made was almost deafening.
Stiff underclothing is one sin that cannot be laid
at the adipose woman’s door —her idea being to
keep as slim as possible. Rustling starch is the
thin woman’s mode of torture. A feature of the
circle was the way several Johnnies wore their
handkerchiefs tucked under their chins to prevent
their collars turning to chewed thread. I hey
looked like aldermen at a dinner-party.
One of Sydney’s prettiest girls—Miss Maude
Roberts —was the centre of a reception given by
her father and mother at the Hotel Australia the
other day in honor of her marriage (on •th mst.)
with Mr. Stanley Mylins. The reception was
largely attended, and the bride-elect wore a
becoming pink gown. By the way, it was at the
Hotel Australia the young people first met.
“She” was collecting alms in the vestibule for
Hospital Saturday when “ he ” first saw her, so
the story goes. After this the committee will
experience no difficulty in yarding up recruits to
rattle the hospital boxes.
Another more or less ante-nuptial ceremony
took place at Sydney Hospital the other day,
when the resident medical and official staff pre-
sented a handsome instrument-case, and the
matron and nursing staff a walnut book-case and
some well-bound books, to Dr. George Armstrong,
the retiring medical superintendent, who is shortly
to marry the daughter of a well-known railway
contractor and settle down to private practice.
The war still wages in Sydney as to whether
women riding on the tram-dummy should object
to smoking thereon ; and so great is the feminine
predilection for dummying and glaring at any un-
fortunate man who dares to strike a match that it
has been suggested that the car be turned into a
smoker, leaving the dummy for the ladies. But
if women will go where men go and yet ‘ ‘ kick ” at
their habits, it looks as if there was a screw loose
somewhere, and between an absence of courtesy
on the one side and the absurd hyper-sensitiveness
affected by some women where tobacco is con-
cerned on the other, the fight for the dummy pro-
mises to be a model exposition of nineteenth-
century selfishness. For my part, I don’t think
the dummy should be the exclusive property of
either sex, but men should certainly be permitted
to smoke thereon, and women shouldn’t glare like
frozen Gorgons at the first hint of tobacco, which
never yet gave anybody a headache in the open
ail’. Besides, most women really like tobacco, on
the principle that wherever there is a pipe there
also is a man. “ Love me, love my dog.”
Apropos smoking—at the recent encampment,
where Major-General Hutton wiped out arrears of
biting sarcasms by tremendous doses of valedictory
flattery, he had enough snap left to come
down heavily upon an officer who turned up with
a pipe in his mouth while the General was address-
ing the troops. When he spotted the pipe, he
crisply ordered the gallant captain to the rear (not
a bad punishment in war-time, by the way)—but
if we must have military discipline it was well-
deserved; for a man with a pipe in his mouth has
an unconquerable aspect of slackness and content-
ment irreconcilable with the geometrical alertness
of your real Captain Gingah. Though everybody
smokes in Australia, The other day, on a
lordly carriage, the coachman had a short clay in
full blast; the footman another to match ; while
one of the orderlies placidly smoked a wooden-
pipe. It was a peaceful scene—quite in the
Australian vein—but it scarcely looked official.
Mark Twain, of the smiling countenance, is
gone from our shores, but a remark made by
Mark Twain’s daughter, whose naivete must be
very trying to her family, remains. Somebody
was congratulating her on the pleasure she must
find in gadding about with her talented father,
but Miss Twain grew mournful. “ Oh, it’s not
always like this, you know ” (meaning her father’s
Sydney success). “Sometimes it’s very unplea-
sant, and, sitting in the audience, we hear things
we’re not meant to hear.” It’s to be hoped this
confiding maiden won’t be trusted to write her
gifted pa’s biography.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Premier Turner, in the old familiar sac
suit and the same old boxer hat, and carrying a
conspicuous watchchain parted in the middle, was
Lady Brassey’s escort when the Governor and
suite appeared in the arena at the A.N.A. sports
in Melb. Exhibition grounds. George’s habitual
preoccupation was broken in spots, when he
favored her Ladyship with a short remark and a
long gesticulation. Premier Turner is original
enough in dress and manner to be a really strong
democratic Premier.
“ From an army point, of view,” says a
leading Australian military officer who has seen
much service, “ the death of Battenberg in
Ashantee will have a good effect. It will prevent
any more princelings from going to war and
getting in the way. It will be shown that there
are dangers other than being killed by ballets—a
risk, of course, which princes are not on any
account allowed to run. Not even as a relaxation
from the burden of a mother-in-law will any
other Prince be allowed to go on a fighting ex-
pedition.”
New York World published a page of
photograph pictures of the ghastly Hilliard horror.
Hilliard was the negro whom the nobility and gentry
of Tyler, Texas, burned to death for the alleged
murder of a white man’s wife. The victim is
variously depicted as pleading for mercy, trembling
at the stake, and being roasted to death. The
last is a very artistic photo, of flames, smoke, ex-
cited bystanders, and frizzling negro. It seems
that the fire was partially extinguished once oi
twice to permit of the photographer getting an
effective negative. Wonder what the World’s
circulation was on that day ?
Anglican Bishop Stanton (N.S.W.) blow-
piping local martial ardour :
The torch of liberty has been lighted at the altar oi
religion, and it (religion ?) can play the lamb as well as
the lion.
How often has “the torch of liberty” been ex-
tinguished from “the altar of religion?” The
torch of persecution has been lighted at and kept
continually burning on the “altar of religion”;
and it is chiefly from the flame of that torch of
persecution that the light of the taper of liberty
has come. Also, to boast that religion “ can
play the lamb as well as the lion ” is merely to
say that a bully can enact the occasional rble of
a wheedling hypocrite.
N.S.W. ex-Premier Dibbs writes to the
papers “ as an old volunteer officer and one of the
earliest to enlist during the time of the Russian
war of 1854-5,” urging the formation of a volunteer
corps or landwehr in N.S.W., and requesting
would-be volunteers to call round at the Savings
Bank and put down their names. “ I still feel
able to shoulder a musket,” says G. R. Dibbs,
“ and I think, on emergency;, could bring down
my man.” The Bulletin thinks it can hear in a
dream the voice of Private Dibbs damning
Chicago in the ranks. It suggests, with all
respect, that people don’t shoulder muskets
nowadays ; also, tha,t the rush of the warlike
multitude to the Savings Bank may badly upset
the officials who are busy just now calculating the
interest. And if Private Dibbs feels qualified to
bring down his man why doesn’t he practise on
Reid, who is a pretty copious target ?
The N.S.W. Agricultural Society holds a
carnival at Easter, and shows that it is in earnest
about Federation by having all the Australian
Governors at the opening on the 2nd April. It
will also invite Lord Hampden to click off a mile
on the fine new cinder track which has been
christened after him. The total prize money
amounts to =£2500. Horses come in for substantial
prizes ; ladies’ and gentlemens hunters are
particularly well-treated. One praiseworthy
feature is the <£so prize given by the Govt, for
best export butter.

Brisbane Telegraph is now “agin” the

The decision that the new Vic. railway-

and that his screw is to be £2OOO or under, means
that Mr. Back, the ex-Maori lander and present
Tasmanian boss, will probably get the post.
A quiet move is being thought out in Mel-

be turned into working men’s clubs. And it is
said that it only needs trying to be successful in,
say, five years’ time.
“ In view of the threatening situation in

It is reckoned that 25,000 tons of American
wheat are already on the sea, bound for Sydney,
with any amount more to follow, and still larger

The cornstalk wheatgrower may therefore take a
back seat until further notice.
At a Launceston Federation meeting last

Then they strenuously howled that Hobart was
the only possible site for the Federal capital.
Printers Prendergast and Hancock, Ms.P.,

Also it will be
suggested that
Kingston him-
self, who is try-

As showing the disintegrated condition of
the N.S.W. labor-organisations, it is worth noting
that, at the annual conferences of the Political
Labor League, last week, there were but 30 dele-
gates present, where there should have been fully
130. Yet this minority gathering calmly pro-
ceeded to alter and remodel the league’s fighting
political platform.
Last August, Westralian Treasurer and
Premier Forrest estimated the revenue for the
financial year ending June next at £1,291,150.
For half the period, to Dec. 31, £767,643 have been
received, and it is estimated that the revenue for
the whole year will be about £1,700,000. Next to
falling off a log, there is nothing easier in W.A.

“Our godless education system! Dr.”
Anderson, the new bishop of Riverina, at the

the magnificent opportunity accorded to clergy-
men by the Govt.” Saul among the Secularists !
The S.A. Fatman league has apparently
ceased its wealth-tax advocacy, and intends to
rely on “ strict economy ”as its platform. The
league’s official organ preached “ men, not
measures,” and sneered at tne idea of considering
the policy of a candidate before his character. To
what extent the league is prepared to investigate
in such a direction many intending Ass candi-
dates are particularly anxious to ascertain.
The Wages Attachment Bill (Vic.) pro-
mises to remedy what England remedied long ago,
viz., the application of the procedure of attachment
to wages of small amounts. Democratic members
should note, however, that there are English deci-
sions to the effect that the salary of the secretary
of a company, no matter how small, may be
attached, and also that there is doubt whether the
English Act applies to the Supreme Court.
Chairman Harrold, of S.A. National De-
fence League :
Some politicians said that the people in town ignored
the interests of the country people, but there was not a
grain of truth in the assertion. They were too wise not
to know from what sources they gained their means of
livelihood.
“Some people say that lam your enemy,” said
the lion to the lamb. “It is a base falsehood. I
am deeply interested in you.” And he made a

If it be true that “ Uncle ” Paul Kruger
intends to close up the gold-mines of Johannes-
burg (it is probably a lie floated by the in-
genious Rhodes-faction which runs South African
cable-agencies), then some big trouble may be ex-
pected shortly. The “ (Jutlander ” may stand a
lot so long as his pocket is not seriously affected,
but, if the Boer President shuts down on the gold
and the dividends, and freezes up £130,000,000
worth of European capital, all the Gehenna avail-
able will wake up. When the British Lion is
kicked in the bullion he is a truly fearsome animal.
Prendergast, the rashest radical in Vic.
Assembly, has utterly disgusted the best people by
his conduct in opposing the Ministerial proposal
to send a cable of condolence to the Pre-eminent

sympathy with the Queen, but no more than I
would have with any other woman under similar
circumstances,” he declared, and the stout gentle-

men present cried “ Shame ! ” and went purple
with outraged loyalty. When the proposal was
passed, and Prendergast moved that the message
be sent by letter, as the partially-busted country
had no money to waste on cables, ‘ ‘ Thank God
you will not find a seconder ! ” cried the podgy
Ephraim Zox, hoarse with frantic efforts to draw
attention to his unselfish devotion to the Throne

seconded, so the alleged condolences of a unani-

before breakfast.
C. J. Ham, of the ham-fat brigade, had
no difficulty in getting Vic. Upper House to pro-
vide in the Federation Bill that each Convention
candidate shall deposit £5O as a guarantee of
respectability and of a stake in the country—that
Convention candidates will be quite conventional,
in short. The Council would have been delighted
to make the cash “ recommend ” £5OO, but it is
never quite rid of a wholesome fear that the
democratic worm will turn one day.
“EIGHTY-TWO IN THE SHADE.”
Some little time ago the Vic. Government
sent to England for a supply of ammunition for
the local troops, but, owing to pressure of other
orders, or something, it was nine months before
the material came to hand. If a foreign enemy
ever comes bombarding these parts, and the local
troops fire off all their cartridges at him, and cable
to England for more, and get them in nine months,
then the full advantage of depending on foreign
supplies will become as visible as Mount Kos-
ciusko.
The M.L. Adoption of Children Act pro-
vides that a married couple may adopt a male or
female child, a single man may adopt a boy 18
years younger than himself, or a girl 40 years
younger, and a single woman may adopt a boy 40
years, or a girl 18 years younger than herself.
The name of the adopting parent is conferred on
the adopted child in addition to its proper name.
Rights of inheritance from the adopter, to a certain
limited extent, are given to the adopted child,
and corresponding rights taken from it as regards
its old family.
When Premier Turner proposed a new
rule by which unfinished bills would be taken up
at the meeting of Parliament just where they
were lew last session, instead of having to be
started all over again, Madden, M.L.A., re-
marked in a tone of loathing that it was just
the kind of proposal which might be expected
from such a Government.” And his voice was
the voice of a pious man who had just listened to
a proposal for a universal drunk and the abolition
of marriage and the establishment of polygamy

Vic. Legislative Council appointed a com-
mittee to take evidence as to the necessity for the
Factories Bill—the Turner Government’s anti-
sweating measure. The evidence was almost
unanimously hostile. This shows the advantage
of carefully selecting witnesses who will give the
kind of evidence that the Leg. Council wants to
hear. One great object of the measure is to
abolish sweating in the Chinese furniture-trade,
and sundry Chinese boss furniture-makers, who
have been examined, have testified unanimously
that any such interference is quite unnecessary.
The S.A. State Loan Department expects
to get into working order this month. The
Maoriland one is steadily going ahead, and the
Reid Government proposes to start a similar
establishment in N.S. Wales if Parliament con-
sents. This latter fact was announced the other
day by Minister Young, but nothing was said as
to whether the needful funds are to be raised
locally, or whether it is intended to float the good
old loan in London as usual. Also, the Govern-
ment has since been severely sat upon by Sydney
D.T., and now says that it doesn’t contemplate a
State Loan Department at all.
N.S.W. Education Department is now
demanding from teachers a statement of the exact
date of their last entrance into the service. It has
just been found that, by an entirely new reading
of the Superannuation Act, all civil-servants who
may at one time have resigned can only claim a
refund of moneys they may have paid into
the wild-cat fund from the date of their last re-
entering the service. Which means that a C.S.
who has been a compulsory contributor to the
fund since its inauguration, and who may have
resigned any time before 31st Dec. last, simply
gets nothing, even if he has since re-entered the
service. The service must be continuous, or date
from the day of the last re-entrance —so says the
newly -appointed Civil Service Board.
The contest for the representation of
Waverley in N.S.W. Assembly, vacated by the
death of Angus Cameron, promises at time of
writing to be a seven or fourteen-sided duel.
Parkes is mentioned, and so is that caricature in
petto of Parkes —Alfred Allen. Likewise boss-
Orangeman Jessep, also Protectionist Barlow and
Foreign-trader John Hurley; likewise Tiger
Inglis and “Tommy” Walker. The Protec-
tionists, if organised, should win the seat.

Hancock, M.L.A., tried liard to get a
clause inserted in the new Vic. Railway Bill pro-
viding that Speight should be the first Railway
Commissioner under the new regime, instead of
the appointment being left to the Ministry, but
Turner promptly intimated that if the clause was
carried the Government would resign, and that
broke down the scheme. The old plea was
advanced that Speight had merely mistaken the
boom for the country’s natural condition—which
was probably quite true, for almost everybody did
it. Speight got instructions from an insane
Government to waste a lot of money in construc-
tion, but the working expenses were his own
foolishness.
A Bill was lately passed through Vic.
Assembly providing that the unfinished business
of one session should go right on next session
instead of having to be all done over again, but
the Council received it with a yell of derision and
threw it out by 28 votes to eight. The measure
would, of course, apply to all business alike, and
would help along a hunk of bigotry and Fat Man
legislation from the Upper House, quite as much
as a democratic idea from the Assembly. But the
Council objects to business in general, and ob-
structs from sheer force of habit. Business con-
tains in it an awful suggestion of doing some-
thing, and the Council, because it can’t crawl
backward quite all the time, would much rather
not do anything. What it would like would be a
provision that all Bills must be read 166 times in
eight successive sessions on a unanimous vote of
both Houses before becoming law. Then things
would be just about slow enough for it.
The Sydney morning papers publish a
lengthy communication from a person named
Lucas, who holds that the reduction of wages in
the N.S.W. candle-trade is quite needless, and
that the trade can boom along serenely even
though the duty has been reduced and will shortly
be abolished altogether. It is merely a matter of
management, says Lucas. “I have known a
Maoriland factory where I could turn out 15,000
or 20,000 boxes a week with machinery costing
about =£llooo, while I know Australian factories
which spent £20,000 or £30,000 for machinery turn-
ing out perhaps only twice as much. ” Also Mr. L.
might have added that in Maoriland the protective
duty is 2d. per lb., which is higher than it was in
N.S.W. even under the Dibbs regime; and that
the Protective policy seems firmly settled in the
province; therefore the manufacturers, feeling
that the local market was secure, spent their
money freely on new and improved machinery—
which the N.S.W. man, who was always living on
the verge of a precipice, never had energy enough
to do. When an industry is likely to go smash
anyhow, the average man scrambles along with
the antediluvian machinery he has on hand, and
doesn’t worry about new improvements. The
morning papers choose to overlook this side of the
case.

Agent-General Saul Samuel is
the oldest ex-N.S.W. Crown Minister,
having been Treasurer in the Forster
Ministry of 1859. Sheriff Cowper is
next as Clerk of the Executive Council,

London Athenaeum, in a very
superior and snobbish two-column
obituary-notice, says that Sala mistook
his vocation, and should have been a
cook. It counts to his credit that he
always claimed to be “a mere journalist

the man who wrote “ Twice Round the
Clock ” and “The Conversion of Colonel
Quagg ” must be accounted a man of
letters !
Barrister John Emanuel Mackey,
widely alleged in Melb. to be author of
many of Attorney-General Isaac’s plead-
ings, was originally a compositor at
Mason, Firth and M ‘Cutcheon’s. Stimu-
lated by the example of a brother comp,
who had matriculated, Mackey worked
at case by day, and at books by night •
then he began studying law at Melb.
University, where he obtained the final
honor scholarships in Logic and Philo-
sophy, Wyselaskie scholarships in Con-
stitutional History and in Political
Economy, the Bowen Essay prize, and
the Cobden Club Medal. He has for
five years been a University examiner
in Logic, Philosophy, History and Geography, and
has been an acting lecturer during the illness of
Prof. Laurie.
The heaviest N.S.W. bicyclist is probably
Arthur Fairfax Smythe, of Sydney Daily Tele-

Mr. Barling, of the newly - appointed

taken a holiday for over 10 years. Which looks
ominous for the Service.
Mr. Justice Hood is the only bona-fide

for which he is said to display even greater talent.
Acting Justice Cohen is the most uncon-

which drove Hourigan’s wheel to the lead after a

altogether £258 in prize-money, and, of course,
with the eternal fitness of things cycling, he is in
the trade. He manages a branch cycle depot at
Carlton, Melb. The only men to down Zimmer-
man (who is in the trade) were Parsons, Pither
and Walker—all in the trade.
King Billy, last of
the Ballarat blacks, has
fallen on evil days. In
1850, Billy and 200 of his
tribe held a special cor-
roboree on the site of the
Ballarat Town Hall, in
Sturt - street; of these
performers Billy alone
survives. Only just out
after 14 days for obscene
language, Billy went
looking for his stray
dog, struck a hotel on
the Burrumbeet - road,
got outside of three pints
of beer and inside the
lockup. To the ‘ ‘ beak, ”
next day, Billy said,
“ Have mercy on the
poor old man who built
up the city,” at the same
time with extended arms
volubly declaring he
would never get drunk
again. Asked at the
lockup the usual ques-
tion as to religious belief,
Billy declared that he
was a Roman Catholic.
The Bench was merci-
ful, Billy was vociferous
in his thanks for his dis-
charge, and left to tramp
to Bacchus Marsh after
“anew dog.”
Nimmo used to have
an odd fashion of talk-
ing’ about himself in the
third person. In the
South Melbourne Coun-
cil they wanted to make
him a member of the

“Explorer” Albert Calvert tells, in one
of his works of fiction, how he was dying of

A subscription is being raised in Melb. for
the widow and children of the late Lionel Cowen,

land. His brother, conductor Fred. Cowen, lost
the whole of his handsome Melb. Exhibition

panies.
Lady Brassey has, probably, made a record.
She is the only peeress, The Bulletin supposes,
who has been the sole representative of her sex at
a banquet attended by about 600 people. Also,
she is the only woman on earth whose individual
presence has prevented some 500 Victorian natives
from smoking.
J. L. Parsons, the Jap’s friend, formerly
N.T. Govt. Resident, and known as the “eccen-
tric ” member of a former S.A. Assembly, is going
to run for the Territory at the approaching elec-
tion. Parsons was in turn a clergyman, land-
agent, and National Ass lecturer. He is a
brother-in-law of millionaire Angas.
On one occasion Speight, when chairman
of Vic. Railway Commissioners, got out at a sub-
urban station, and found no one at the gate to
take the tickets. He stopped and did that duty
himself, without considering it necessary to report
the delinquent porter for his remissness. All the
same, that porter never neglected that gate again.
As an unfleshly painter of classical subjects,
Sir Frederick Leighton had no rival in England—
or anywhere, perhaps. A female study from the
nude by the president of the Royal Academy, is
an object-lesson in the chastity of true art, and
even a commercial traveller would have to be very
drunk before he could wink his other eye at the
lady.
it stuck in Vic. Premier Turner’s gizzard
to have to move the “ loyal ” address to Queen
Victoria re the death of Battenberg. The Cabi-
net decided that the message should be sent,
and Turner moved it in a perfunctory style.
There could be “no harm in it,” he said. Turner
confesses that he “takes no blessed interest in
Royal families and their relatives.”
Demise. Victoria’s pensioner, H. C. E.
Childers, at the early age (for a pensioner) of 69.
Since 1852, Childers has drawn <£Bo7 per annum
from Victoria for having to go out when Respon-
sible Government came in. He was known in
Melb. as “Huge Curly Headed Childers.” The
British Government has now only two Victorian
billets in its gift, the Governorship, and the
deputy-mastership of the Mint.
A. F. Calvert had almost completed the
exploration of West Australia—from the windows
of special trains and the box-seats of coaches —
when he sustained sunstroke, and so the great
work had to remain uncompleted. The accident
should be a warning to young men going explor-
ing who are not accustomed to being out in the
sun. Calvert is now a fallen rocket in W.A., and
his departure to England to float companies is
thus opportune.

G. C. Tompson, chairman of the Land

Being a born comedian who went astray in his
youth, his quips and cranks are wont to move the
jury to a roar, and under his management the
local morgue has become a dangerous rival of the
music-halls and pantomime. Naturally the Coro-
ner’s entertainment is particularly popular at
Youl-tide, and the Melbourne citizen who is down
on his luck, and feeling broken-spirited and done
up, invariably drifts into the morgue when the
coroner is in the bill, and comes away refreshed,
strengthened, and rejuvenated by the cheery
humor of the doctor over a bleached and
sodden body fresh from the Yarra, or the
newest suicide with a gashed neck or a gun-
shot wound in his unpleasant head. Re-

personage. At 70 the oft-quoted subject of this
notice retains all his mental power, and suffers
from nothing save gout, which he regards as a
safety-valve—an enemy put into the foot to steal
away more dangerous ailments from the rest of
him. The gout has never flown to his seat of
memory, anyway. Dr. Youl, the raconteur, is
unique. He has a wonderful repertoire of tales
ancient and modern, tales of the quick and the

F.5.1.A., who had been Auditor in previous years.
During the Half-year 12 Branches have been closed.

roceedings
Minutes
of
The Report was adopted and ordered to be printed and circulated amongst the proprietors. „
It was carried that “ The thanks of the Meeting be accorded to Mr. J. S. Dunlop for his very valuable services during his tenure of office.
A vote of thanks was accorded to the Directors, General Manager, and Officers of the Bank for their able and satisfactory conduct of the business during the half-year.
The Chairman, in moving the adoption of the Report, said :
I regret that since we last met the Bank has sustained a distinct loss by the death of its late
Chairman Mr. Walter Friend. He was a man of considerable commercial ability, as well as of keen
iudgment' and his best efforts were invariably exercised for the benefit of this institution.
You will notice from the Report, which you have now had some time, that we pay the same rate
of dividend as last half-year, place ,£2OOO to the credit of the new Reserve Fund, making it £oo,ooo,
and carry over to next half-year £2635 12s. Id. , „„ n „ „. , , , ■
During the half-year liabilities of the old Bank amounting to =£032,640 ss. 2d. have been dis-
charged and the discharge of the liabilities of the old Bank at the end of last half-year was £4,893,180
7s 2d •’ but taking off the amount of the Inscribed Deposit Stock, which, however, is not payable
except at the option of the Bank, makes nearly Four and a Half Millions, the exact amount being
499 044 19s lOd. . ...
’ Meanwhile you will perceive, from a comparison of the figures which I will read to you, giving the
of the Sk on the 31st becember, 1895, the 30th June, 1895, and the 20th April, 1893, respec-
tively, that our Reserves of Coin and Cash items have been more than maintained

remains as the amount of the liability which has been paid.
You will observe that our amounts exhibit a significant expansion of business in regard to the
Note Issue and Bills in Circulation, which indicate that we are improving our current business, which
is indeed further displayed by the increase in Current Accounts, notwithstanding that we have closed
so many Branches.
Though we have since the 30th June last reduced the extended Deposits of the old Bank by
.£532,640 as part of the result of the offer to Depositors intimated in the third paragraph of the late
Chairman’s address at the last meeting, and which you will doubtless regard as substantial, I wish you
to notice that our reserves of Coin and Cash items are larger by .£197,264 than at the 30th June last,
and now amount to .£1,863,323. We are therefore prepared to pay further amounts so as to anticipate
still more the obligations due in 1897 and onwards.
The amount of New and Extended Deposits is now .£481,846, the increase during the half-year
being .£207,758, of which the greater part is not payable for eleven years, and is a solid addition to our
resources, as is the Inscribed Deposit Stock, .£391,141, which has increased during the half-year.
Since the 30th June last, expenditure has been reduced by the closing of branches which have
been found to be unprofitable, and a suitable economy will still require to be exercised, not only in
consequence of the pressure of the times, but to meet the amount which it will be henceforward
necessary to set aside half-yearly, to provide for Land and Income Tax. The change of fiscal policy
may, however, be so important a factor in the direction of increasing the volume of trade and generally
stimulating commercial and industrial enterprise, that its effect will more than balance the additional
amount required to be provided, and I am sure it is your earnest wish that time may realise the best
aspirations of those who are responsible.
The year just passed has been most unfavorable to those engaged in agricultural, pastoral, and, I
may add, mining pursuits, and the prospects for the present'year appear far from encouraging. As a
consequence, banks and kindred institutions have been affected in sympathy, but I have confidence in
the vitality and recuperative powers of the country, and do not despair that a return to normal seasons
will, combined with forethought and economy, restore us again to that state of prosperity to which we
have for some time been strangers.
I have endeavored to explain as clearly as possible the position of the Bank on 31st December,
1895, compared with its position on 20th April, 1893, and on 30th June, 1895, and if the shareholders
are of opinion that it is strengthened, and that the management has been conducted with care and
efficiency, that is a sufficient recognition of the services of the Board.
I am confident that the appointment of the Hon. James Watson to a seat on the Board of
Directors, and of Mr. J. B. C. Miles to the position of Auditor, will receive the approval of the meet-
ing, and that it will take this opportunity of recording its recognition of the valuable services of Mr.
John Sym Dunlop, the retiring Auditor.

Dr. Maloney, M.P., Vie., who lately had
a generous send-off from his West Melb. consti-
tuents on his trip to the so-called East for health,
told them his object in life, formed as a doctor in
the London slums, has been the alleviation of
human suffering ; and it must be admitted that
his eight years’ Parliamentary service have
evinced it. The little doctor mentions that, in
London, he attended a woman in confinement, and
the rest of a largo family had to wait outside
because they only had one room.
Austin Bidwell, the Bank of England
forger and one of the historical swindlers of the
century, describes in his memoirs the fate of the
average “ lifer ” :
After a time, I began to watch the effects of the un-
natural life upon others. They arrived full of resolution,
buoyed often by hopes which they were soon destined to
find delusive. The short-time men—those with seven or
ten-year sentences-could face the prospect hopefully.
To them, the day would come when the prison-gate must
swing back and the path to the world be open once more.
But no such hope cheers the long-timers—the men
with 20 years and life—who quickly learn how great
the proportion is of their number who find relief
only in the box smeared with black which en-
closes what is left of them in the grave. Every day I
used to see the effects on them of hunger and torment of
mind. The first part visibly affected was the neck. The
flesh shrinks, disappears, and leaves what looks like two
artificial props to support the bead. As time w r ears on
the erect posture grows bent; instead of standing up
straight the knees bulge outward as though unable to
support the body’s weight, and the man drags himself
along in a kind of despondent shuffle. Another year or
two and his shoulders are bent forward. He carries his
arms habitually before him now, he has grown moody,
seldom speaks to any one, nor answers if spoken to. In
the general deterioration of the body the mind keeps equal
step ; and so unfailing is the effect that even warders
wait to see it, and remark to each other that so-and-so is
“ going off.” When the sufferer begins to carry his arms
in front everyone understands that the end is coming.
The projecting head, the sunken eye, the fixed, expres-
sionless features are merely the outward exponents of
the hopeless, sullen brooding within. Sometimes the
man merely keeps on in that way, wasting more and
more, body and mind, every day, until at last he drops
and is carried into the infirmary to come out no more.
Bidwell reckons he was saved from this fate by the
arrival in his cell of a copy of Shakespeare. He
had read a Bible and a dictionary for 19 years by
that time, and was just perishing of the monotony
of Jeremiah. “Monotony,” as some one truly
observed, “is hell,” and Jeremiah and whitewash
are monotony incarnate.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Australian Eleven chosen by Giffen, Gar-
rett, and Bruce has only five men—Graham, Gregory,
Trumble, G. Giffen, and H. Trott—of the ’93 team, and
has eight new men—Donnan, Iredale, M’Kibbin (N.S.W.),
Harry, Johns (Vic.), Darling, Jones (S. Aus.), and Eady
(Tas.)—in place of Blackham, A. Bannerman, Coningham,
Brace, W. Giffen, Jarvis, Lyons, R. M’Leod, and C.
Turner.
* * » *
Turner was omitted, perhaps, partially because
of his damaged forefinger ; some others possibly because
of their little fingers and the flexibility of their elbows.
* » * *
The fortunates selected as the representative
Australian team intend urging the Cricket Council to send
’ome 15 men, and give A. E. Trott and Lyons a show.
Turner has no friends.
* * * *
Suggested that the following team should be
pitted against the Australian representative eleven already
selected : —Turner, Bruce, Coningham, Walters, M’Kenzie,
M’Donnell, C. M‘Leod, Hill, Garrett, Jarvis, and Howell.
* * • *
Dear Bulletin,—Re that Australian representa-
tive team. Turner’s omission is a huge mistake. ’Ome
thrice, he topped the bowling average on each occasion.
Then a hitter is wanted in Lyons, who should have
Trumble’s place. Kelly ought to have had a show as
wicket-keep, because he is as good as Johns, and his hands
will stand, being hard as nails. Johns’s are soft as putty,
and he seems half-hearted, apparently not caring whether
he plays or looks on. Why should Darling be selected as
a certainty before the excluded Albert Trott ? There’s no
comparison. Trott’s record last season and this is much
the better. Eady is an experiment, and mayn’t prove the
batsman he’s thought to be. Kenny Burn (Tas.) tops his
batting averages every season. M’Kibbin is another
experiment, and will either be a great success or a hard
frost. So far as batting power goes Johns, Jones,
M’Kibbin, TVumble, and Eady can’t be trusted to get 40
runs among ’em, and it’s 100 to one the others won’t all
be in form at the same time. As to the captaincy, Giffen
shouldn’t have it. Trott would be a better man, but a
bowler should never be captain, as he doesn’t know when
to take himself off.—Old Rep.
* ♦ * *
M'Kibbin says he cannot realise he is in the
Australian Eleven. He is indeed lucky to be in while
A. E. Trott, Turner, and Howell are out. M’Kibbin’s
best bowling performance against Stoddart’s team was
five for 98, in Brisbane. A. E. Trott got six for 103 in
Vic. v. England ; and eight for 43 in Aus. v. Eng., at
Adelaide. And where does M’Kibbin compare with
A.E.T. as a batsman ? The Vic. colt scored successively
against Stoddart’s company 25, 11 not out, 38 not out, 72
not out, 85 not out, 10, 0, 46, 44 ; an average of 66. M‘Kib-
bin is a fair field, while A. E. Trott is brilliant.
* * * *
Last time Giffen wouldn’t go ’Ome without
brother Walter. It now looks as if he won’t go without
Lyons. Giffen fancies himself the dictator-general of
Australian cricket.
» * * *
H. Trott thinks that Iredale’s cut and Donnan’s
playing for the pitch will cause those cracks some trouble
on the English wickets.
* * * *
Before going out for his second innings wicket-
keeper Kelly was remarking that his provincial batting
average was close on 70. He was bowled for a duck, and
came back crestfallen.
• * * *
The N.S.W. team beaten by Vic. this time was
stronger by the inclusion of Gregory and Turner than the
team which beat Vic. a few weeks back.
* * * •
When, in the final innings, six Vic. wickets
were down for 135, the Victorians felt anxious. N.S.W.
captain Garrett had said that, if N.S.W. got H. Trott out
before 70 runs, Victoria would lose. Trott was out just
before 70, to a beautiful catch by Kelly. And now, as
Harry went in, Victoria was on pins and needles. But,
early in Harry’s innings, luck declared for Victoria.
When 20 runs were needed, Donnan was brought in from
the outfield close to the wickets. There was laughter and
exclamation among the Vic’s—“ Why, that’s just what
Harry wants! ” And, sure enough, the next ball
“Twister” received he hit right up to the spot Donnan
had vacated. When 10 runs were wanted, the Vic’s were
still anxious. “ Four wickets can fall for 0,” said H.
Trott; “ I won’t be sure of winning till the winning hit is
made.” But it was made.
* * * *
When the crisis came in the Vic. v. N.S.W.
match, the Sydney canaille, in order to upset the Vic-
torians, insulted them most disgustingly. Many of the
refuse thought N.S.W. was sure to win, and one leather-
lunged beast kept hooting, “ You d —- —Victorians, you’ve
got your tails down, and I’m glad of it; you were
getting too much up in the stirrups, you .” And
so on.
* * * »
Jones is the least promising selection for the
Australian Eleven. As a batsman he will be little more
than a passenger, and as a fast bowler, on generally dull
ground, the Englishmen, in the opinion of many
flood judges, will find him one of the common kind.
Three years ago the Australians in England tried to per-
suade themselves that Richardson was merely a Jones
bowling on a favorable wicket, but the Surrey man’s per-
formance out here showed them their mistake.
* * * •
“ The most effective bowling I ever saw,” says
11. Trott, “ was the Australian bowling in the last test-
match. It won the match for the Englishmen.”
H. Trott has seen all the best batsmen at their
best many times, but thinks no innings compares with
Percy M'Donnell’s 83 while A. Bannerman made 2 against
North of England in ’BB It turned defeat into victory.
* * * *
Says R. M‘Leod : “There is no denying that
All England is too good for All Australia. I thought they
were not, but when I got to England and saw them
coming out to bat —Grace ! Shrewsbury ! Gunn ! Stod-
dart! W. W. Read! Jackson ! Heaven and earth ! their
sixth was better than our first.”
* * * *
The opinion seems to gain ground that Sid
Gregory is somewhat off this season. He has certainly
not played up to his past performances, nor made any
sensational stands. But he still has plenty of time to pull
himself together before the English trip.
* * * *
Dear Bulletin,—Bob M'Leod is sore on the
subject of “professional managers,” because he was only
beaten in the last stride by Harry Musgrove for the
professional' managership of the Australian Eleven.—
Observer.
* * * »
Said that Moses goes to England in April, and
will play in matches with the Australian Eleven.
* * * *
Harry, the Vic. cricketer who gets a place in
the Australian Eleven for wicket-keeping, batting, bowl-
ing, fielding, sobriety, and judgment, is a veteran of 38
years. He didn’t begin as a bowler until seven years ago,
as a pro. of East Melb. C.C. ; and he didn’t try wicket-
keepmg until two years ago. He plays baseball in winter,
and when the wind favors him he can break the ball in
the air. Both Garrett and Johns in last match expected
the ball which bowled Garrett to come to the leg-side ;
but it pitched outside the line of the off stump and bowled
the leg stump. Harry is as hard as iron ; when the ball
hits him it leaves a bit of its skin on Harry.
A. E. Trott, acting on the advice of umpire
Phillips, will probably go to England, and become a pro-
fessional there. Middlesex is the suggested spot.
Some new pacing arrangements made for the
A.N.A. five-mile “ championship,” at Melb. Exhibition,
were a dire failure. E. H. Lenne worked out a scheme
which on paper appeared good to the biking fraternity.
A first tandem was to break away at a moderate pace,
and go steadily for half-a-mile, after which the regulation
of the speed would be left to any competitor who could
get to the fore. There were to be other tandems, if
necessary, to pick up stragglers in the rear. When the
race came to be run these arrangements went for nothing
at all. Parsons and Lewis pushed the first tandem along
from the start. At two miles a second tandem took up
the running, and Martin joined in the struggle for posi-
tion behind that. The Yank, rode without much regard
for other people’s feelings, nevertheless he didn t get
the best of the bumps. Lewis came out of the melee
with a slight lead, and the men now travelled strictly on
their merits—Lewis, Martin, and Parsons—in the tan-
dem’s wake. Presently Parsons retired, beaten, as, so
far, he has always been beaten when required to chase
riders of his own class. This left Lewis and Martin to
fight out the race between them. The Yank it was who
ordered the tandem to lay on more speed, with the result
that he had Lewis beaten at four miles, and finally won by
300 yards in lli minutes, with the outpaced tanden
between himself and the N.S.W. man. Then Lewis pro-
tested that Martin had been guilty of unfair riding at the
time of his unsuccessful attempt to collar the second
tandem, and so the foreigner who had donkey-licked all
the native riders was disqualified. If the local Parsons
had lost a well-earned prize under similar conditions the
A.N.A. mob would have gone raving mad.
The finish for the one-mile scratch race was
made humorous by the crowd’s persistent barracking for
the local fetish, Parsons. The roar of “Go it, Jack!”
starting at the pistol-shot, swelled louder than ever when
the last bell rang, and “ Jack ” took a 10yds. lead. A few
seconds later, Porta and Martin began to overhaul the
leader, and soon the three men were at close quarters. A
portion of the crowd’s triumphant shout subsided into a
murmur of anxiety. Parsons, on the inside, seemed to
run Martin wide. The ’Murkan’s probable victory became
unlikely, anyway. The young Italian stuck his tongue
out, and came with a great rush on the high ground.
Porta had won by half a wheel, but the crowd on the
opposite side of the track bravoed Jack vociferously,
under the impression that he had just got home. The
awful truth was hoisted, and a sorrowful silence super-
vened.
* * * *
Zimmerman’s opinion re the relative merits of
Parsons and Harris hasn’t been endorsed by the Melb.
bike handieappers for any big money event. Until the
Victorian and the Englishman are put on the same mark
the press might give “ Zimmy’s ” opinion a rest.
* * * *
It is beginning to dawn on the visitors, Martin,
Harris, and Porta, that Victoria’s rich bicycle stakes are
for Victorians. The idea that respectable championship
prizes would be submitted to foreign competition has
withered in their hearts. At the Melb. A.N.A. sports £33
and a gold medal were dedicated to the two scratch races,
whilst £2OO went to one handicap in which none but
third-raters got a reasonable show.
* * * *
“Lewis wins the Championship,” was a patri-
otic bike cross-heading' in Mein. Agk. Lewis, beaten by
two-thirds of a lap, had won the race on a protest, but
that was an unimportant detail under the circs. Imagine
a case of Martin being the other man. The Age heading
would read : “The Australian achieves a brilliant victory
but is disqualified.”
* * * *•
A Bulletin correspondent, speaking as an ex-
perienced bikist who stands somewhat under the average
height, predicts that the champions of the future will be
sturdy, middle-sized men.
« * * *
Martin seems to have evolved a couple of
matches from his grievance re the Five-mile “ Champion-
ship ” race at Melb. Exhibition. He is to meet Lewis in
Sydney, about the middle of March, over the same dis-
tance for £lO a-side, and tackle Parsons in Melb. for £2O
a-side, a fortnight later. The match with Parsons pro-
vides for three races —one, five, and ten miles—the rubber
to take the stake.
* * * *
Cyclist Martin meets the trotter Mystery over
a mile in March, and intends racing her the whole way.
Matterson, the ex - oarsman, exhibited some
brilliant riding in his heats at the A.N.A. sports, but did
not show up in the finals. Want of judgment appears to
be his chief fault; he is too eager to get there, gets there
too early, and then can’t stay there long enough—that’s
what’s the Matterson.
* * * »
The =£3oo A.N.A. wheel-race and other recent
events show that Australian handieappers hold the
second-rate men too lightly in setting down the cham-
pions. All the fliers were so set back that no first-class
man had a look in at any stage for the £250. Porta, who
hung on most resolutely in his heat, was never within
hailing of the first flight. Parsons and Martin were
emphatically out of it from the shot.
An attendance of 10,000 for the L. of V.
Wheelmen meeting at Melb. Cricket Ground last Satur-
day was “ smaller than had been anticipated.” The bike
magnates may as well anticipate much smaller attend-
ances than that presently.
The Italian, Porta, was jockeyed out of a place
in his heat for L.V.W. Cup. The boys blocked him in the
last lap more effectually than they stuck him up for the
Brassey Stakes race, on New Year’s Day, when he managed
to get clear of the field in time to win second prize.
Although the fifth heat of the L.V.W. Cup was
the slowest of the lot, it is likely that the coming winner
of the 100 sovs. was among the placed men—Hill, MTnnes,
G. Irish, and L. B. Scharp. They finished in a bunch.
The one-mile international scratch and five-mile
championship races, at Melb. Ground, last Saturday, were
very tiring to those onlookers who have seen the same

Six to 4 Auraria, and 5 to 2 Wallace, with 10 to
1 bar 2 is, at time of writing, the state of the market re
V.R.C. Champion Stakes. The two crack three-year-olds
seem to be at a false price, as they have to meet such
cattle as Preston, The Harvester, Aquarius, Quiver, St.
Hippo, Fort, Toreador, and Havoc.

a lot of difference. A strange silence is being maintained,
by the way, about the mare’s present condition.

The initial weeding out over Newmarket handi-
cap included a few fancied horses in Cravat, Yanitas,
Destiny, Marusa, Inspiration, and Lord Richmond. The
last-named is still in Aus. Cup, for which the highly-
thought-of Toreador has declined payment. Patron also
disappears, though he’s an acceptor for V.A.T.C. Autumn
Cup. Ronda was badly overhandicapped ; Aquarius can’t
he wound up, and Lord Charles Scott’s elimination may
be due to his non-staying ability.

The real objection to admitting the press to
racing - enquiries comes from the stewards, who
couldn’t go straight to save their lives, and who regard
with horror the very idea of reporters listening to their
rascally cogitations. An interested steward “ speaks to
his money,” and always will.
In the old days, the crowd took a hand in the

Debt-collecting has been by no means a
labor of love in Melb. during the past two years.
Yet, during that period, one firm, Messrs. Holds-
worth and Co., has risen to eminence in this soul-
wearing industry. It is inviting correspondence
from in ter provincial business people by advt. else-
where. *

to an expectant and breathless community.
Rabbits are having anything but a pleasant
time now that Toxa has become the vogue. Since
the introduction of this poison to Australia some
50 tons have been used by private landowners with
marked success. The apathy of the Vic. Land
Department in the matter of rabbit destruction is
being fiercely denounced by the farmers and
graziers of the Southern Province, the Govern-
ment having only used a small quantity of the
poison on badly-infested Crown lands. If this
short-sighted policy is continued, the rodents will
simply drive the farmers off. *

WARRNAMBOOL, VICTORIA.
The Coolest Seaside Resort of Au-tralia.
Testimonial, July 2, 1895. —‘‘Have spent a very plea-
suit ten days at Warrnambool, and are delighted at the
town and your excellent hotel, the Ozone, where we
have received every attention. Were the qualities of the
place known, many visitors from Sydney, who now go to
Tasmania, would certainly come here.”—Mr. and Mrs.
Denison Miller, Sydney, N.S. W.
The Melb. A.N.A. celebration of the day
when Gov. Phillip landed his pioneer batch of
British convicts on the Botany shore, and gave
them a short prayer followed by a long spree, is
getting to be quite worthy of that historic event.
Natives’ Day, at Melb. Exhibition, must have
furnished a new experience for many people. The
scene was as Hinglish as the heart of Lord Brassey
could desire it. Within the Carlton Domain, or
whatever it is called, adjoining the Exhibition
reserve, poverty enjoyed a day out, and hatless,
often shoeless, urchins peered through the railings
at the stream of very middle-class people passing
along to the show entrance. Outside the Exhibi-
tion, young blasphemers sprawled on occasional
little bits of grass-plot, and spat “for all they
were worth.” Inside the building one found a
shabby, spiritless holiday crowd, relieved by
patches of larrikin element. The amuse-
ments offered apart from bicycle sports,
of which only the early birds could see
enough to tempt them to stand around—
were as poor as the average spectator. Lemon-
peel, banana-skins, fragments of sandwich and
greasy pieces of paper littered the floor. Assertive
citizens pulled away at their pipes in open defiance
of “No smoking allowed.” Every now and then
a Collingwood shriek rent the air, and through a
rift in the crowd a pallid little Arry would come
lounging to a refreshment counter with an objec-
tionable’Arriet on either arm. “Drunks” were
not rareties even as early as 4 p.m., but some-
time thereafter the police hustled the unsober
ones off the premises and ordered them to enjoy
themselves on the asphalt paths outside. In a
corner, by the stairs leading to the dome, young
men and spinsters waltzed to a concertina’s doleful
strains. It was a typical larrikin hop. The
dancers wore agonised expressions of countenance,
and the girl’s gaudy hat towered, as a rule, over
the head of her companion in gloom. All this
was happening in the afternoon before the fun of
the A.N.A. Fete had begun to grow fast and
furious, so the writer, who left early like most
peacefully-disposed persons, saw but one stand-up
fight. It was a triangular conflict between three
lydies, with a fourth waiting for a chance to chip
in and make a quartette of the affair. Natives’
Day at Melb. bids fair to become an ugly peg for
some future Max O’Rell to hang a sermon on.
Eno’s “Fruit Salt.” —A lady writes: —“I
think you will be glad to hear that I find your
‘ Fruit Salt ’ a most valuable remedy ; and I can
assure you I recommend it to all my friends, and
the result is always satisfactory. Everything,
medicine or food, ceased to act properly for at
least three months before I commenced taking it,
the little food I could take generally punished me
or returned. My life was one of great suffering,
so that I must have succumbed before long. To
me and our family it has been a great earthly
blessing. I feel I cannot say too much for it.”

A droll incident occurred at the last “ Ander-
son ” meeting of the V.A.T.C., when a previous resolution
reflecting on J. B. Clark’s veracity was expunged. Mr.
R. Molesworth, commenting on the foolishness of Mr.
Frank Madden in having achieved the resolution afore-
said, wound up by expressing a hope that Madden would
be allowed to resign. He meant to say Anderson (whose
resignation was then before the committee), but the slip
of the tongue filled the bill so admirably that the meeting
fel inclined to adopt it as a serious suggestion and
carry it unanimously.

Dan Creedon, the “ Australian pugilist,” was
born in Invercargill (M.L.), and went to school there.
Creedon’s smart knock-out of Smith for the National
Club’s £4OO purse will make him fancy himself —especially
after his recent vanquishing of the much-vaunted Craig.
Creedon, who is a fair give-and-take stand-up fighter, has
now, possibly, an eye to the championship.

W On Monday night, at Sydney Amateur Gym-
nastic Club, the biggest event was a set-to (6oz. gloves)
for keeps between Tweedie and Mansfield, for a trophy
presented by Mr. Geo. Seale. By the sixth round, Mans-
field showed signs of punishment and Tweedie was getting
tired. So the referee called on them to shake hands and
box for the last round. Mansfield was knocked down,
and Tweedie, in his eagerness to win, struck him while
down. Tweedie therefore lost a contest in which he had
the lead right through.
» * * »
“ Everything passed off satisfactorily, there
being no hitch or inquiry of any kind.”—Melb. Age report
of recent Y.A.T.C. meeting. Inasmuch as several
enquiries and disqualifications, which ought to have
occurred, didn’t happen, the lickspittle daily press declares
that the proceedings were above reproach. They will
never have a satisfactory race-meeting in the Melb. dis-
trict until an infuriated public raises Cain and pulls up
the railings by the roots.
* * * *
Harry Knight, who has won so many trots at
Lilliebridge, Sydney, says that whenever he finds it neces-
sary to have a horse-boot patched up before a race, the
horse wearing that boot is bound to win. The local sad-
dler first noticed the coincidence, and pointed it out to
Knight. Sixteen times without a miss the tip has come
off, and in each of the last 12 events the saddler had his
“ little bit ” on the winner.
* * * *
As turf-reform threatens to become fashionable,
the ridiculously small country tracks should come in with
the rest. A great many resemble circus-rings ; ordinary
fields only just manage to line up; two or three can’t
pass at a time ; and tree-stumps pop up promiscuously
when rain washes the earth off. Accide- ts are compara-
tively unnoticed ; but the widow or mother may receive
a guinea from the stewards. Jocks. “ fortunate ” enough
to get mounts know it’s merely a game of chance, Death
holding the joker. Metrop. clubs should see to these
little matters and refuse licenses for meetings on stumpy,
baseball tracks laid out by the Town Surveyor’s office-boy.
* * * *
Many jockeys have a hard row to hoe, as they
seldom get paid for losing mounts. It’s win or nothing.
Then there’s the inevitable “ stiff,” ridden for a bit of
lunch or a glass of beer, wdth the promise of the mount
when he is trying. On that day something better may be
trying also, and the jock, gets nothing for that race
either. So his only remedy is a win “on his own” now
and again when the stable money isn’t up.
* ♦ * *
At most suburban race-meetings the interest is
now largely centred, not in the winning horse, but in the
whipper-in. Punters are getting a better show for their
money by backing “ last past the post.” For, while any
horse might win—did he feel so Inclined—losing (in a
field of “stiffs”) is now the finest of fine arts. Touts
report that undertakers’ hacks —bought at a high pre-
mium—are being trained in secret, with hobbles and leg-
chains, for all forthcoming handicaps.
* * * *
The only way to cure stiffness in the joints of
racers is for clubs to notify (as a condition of entry) that
all non-triers will be shot dead.
. * * * *
Ikey Mo is styled “ commissioner ” by Vic. In-
come Tax Dept. Booking is illegal, you see ! Then why
should the State accept illegally-gained wealth? Why
npt validate the tote and receive about 10,000 per cent, more
in taxes than accrues from Ikey ? Also, the tote’s return
would be accurate to a penny. Ikey mostly “ cooks ” his
to a cinder.
* * * *
A plethora of racing doesn’t advance the in-
terests of the turf. The multiplicity of meetings, to a
certain extent, retards proposed reform. It provides a
living for hordes of social pests, and if an owner doesn’t
choose to win one week he can the next. In M.L., where
Parliament restricted and assessed the number of meet-
ings to be held annually, things are on a much better
basis ; the reduction tends to make owners win when they
can.

South Australia, when visiting Melbourne and
Sydne in February, will probably have several juniors on
trial, notably the two Leaks and a very successful junior
bowler, J. Travers.

“Jack” Ferris, it is reliably asserted, has
reoeived an appointment in an Adelaide insurance-office

INDIGESTION

CURED BY USING

Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkerville, S. Australia, writes :
“ Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; it helped me from the first,—in fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep like
a child.”

Some primitive Methodist imagery from
Parson Parr, M.A., as reported by Sydney
It was gratifying- to be able to report that, in the teeth
of the tremendous impact of the wave of financial depres-
sion which had passed over the colony, &c.
Here san impact that has teeth—a sort of jagged-
saw catapult; and a wave that is depressed and
yet overwhelms —a sort of hollow wave—a deluge
whose concavity is convex.
“Rolf Boldrewood ” writes gushingly o:
the late Francis Adams’s historical drama, “Tibe
r i u ® ” : “Ifis no doubt a wonderful drama, anc
such as no other Australian writer has yet attainec
to in original conception and life portraiture o;
character. W hether the rehabilitation of Tiberius
and the invention of a motive for his hatred anc
intended extirpation of the Roman nobles anc
senators be historically correct or not—the work
is very fine. The episode of the girl Electra as a
solace to his declining, wearied years is graceful
and harmonious, though much opposed to popular
belief in the revelries of Capri.” Unfortunately,
“ Tiberius ” has few readers to debate its merits.
Only a small memorial edition has been published.
.Dr. Lloyd, J.P., of North Melbourne,
consoler of the grass-widow and guide, philosopher
and friend to the unmarried mother, is an impos-
ing vacuum, and talks much emptiness as under :
Dr. Lloyd was of opinion that the people of Victoria had
too many holidays. It struck him that they were more
niad after holidays than work. There was nothin
else but half-holidays and holidays, and it was no wonder
that the country was in its present miserable condition,
i his, at a time when a large percentage of the
population are spending their holidays hunting
vainly for work, and when men, who would be
stalwart if well-fed, are clearing out weekly
because they can find nothing to do in the whole
misconstructed country, is an eloquent proof of
the mental calibre of “ our honorary magistracy.’’
In Sydney, not long ago, a tired doctor
slept soundly, but was awakened by a sudden
glare of light in his eyes. On looking round, there
stood before him two specimens of the typical
burglar class, eyeing him intently—one a short,
lithe, wiry little fellow ; the other a big, brawny
Hercules, one side of whose face was much swollen.
‘ Well ! ” said the doctor, in a somewhat husky
and shaky voice. “ Ah, doctor, wakened already,”
said the little man, in a tone of affected gladness,
didn’t think you’d awake so soon. I was just
goin’ to pinch yer myself ! Fact is, me and Fred,
here, are not on the job to-night—l mean mornin’—
but we want yer to do somethin’ for Fred here.
He’s got the deuce of a habscess, and if
he was to show himself out in the day-
time the cops would nab him sure, so we just
wanted you to fix things up a bit, doctor ! ” “ But
you have broken into this house,” began the
medico. “Don’t be alarmed, gov’nor,” was the
reply. “Of course, we came in without ringing
the bell—a bit too early to wake the servants yet—
but we hain’t touched anythin’ in the house.”
Sawbones looked from one to the other, am'
decided that, in any case, it would be safest, f<.
the moment, to credit their story and ascertain it
truth aftervvards. Hopping out of bed, he slipped
into the consulting-room, clad onlv in pyjamas,
and followed by Sikes and Co. Looking at the
big fellow’s mouth he found a much inflamed and
dirty abscess, caused by a broken tooth-stump,
and put a little cocaine on the gum before lancing!
What s that for, doctor ! ” mumbled the patient.
Only so that you shan’t feel the lance.” “ Yer
a trump ! ” said the swollen burglar. The cutting
removed the bulk of the matter—the rest would
be sure to work away. The two burglars left
entirely satisfied, and the tall one handed the
doctor a£s note. What troubles that doctor is
should he keep the money, or hand it to the police
and give a description of his visitors ? [He should
consult the Chief Justice—as the lawyers and the
private detectives do. —Ed. B.]
Oh, parsons dear, perplex us not
With nightmares variform,
Kaleidoscopic shreds of rot—
The weather is too warm.
From pulpits, perspiration shrinks,
Word-painting plugs the pores,
It’s wholesomer to mix your drinks
Than mix your metaphors.

To Herr Rassmussen,
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a very
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
I was under the treatment of a doctor tor six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

lam now completely cured, and 1 shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for y'our

.A.. UVE R K S,
HAIRDRESSER,
li) Hunter Street, City,
Wishes to intimate to his numerous customers
that in addition to the above, he has just started
a High-class CIGAR and TOBACCONISI’
STORE, next Empire Hotel, Hunter-street.
“ Matrimony signifies that the man with
money enough is privileged to turn a healthy
woman into a drug-shop.”— Novel , by a Lady.
Olcott, the hairy old Theosophist, is bringing
out a book which is to prove the truth of the hazy
Blavatsky creed and confound all sceptics. One
evidence is a facsimile of the cover of a letter
“ phenomenally delivered, ” which looks just the
same as the letter which the snail-like messenger-
boy brings round and delivers with a yawn at the
door. There is also a picture of a “ flower-born
gold box ” —whatever that may be ; and another
representing a “sugar tongs phenomenally pro-
duced,” and looking just like the tongs which
an ironmonger’s shopman will produce any
day if you offer him the money. Further, as a
crowning pi oof, there is a picture representing a
“corner of a mahatma’s turban,” which is quite
undistinguishable from a corner of the turban of
any ordinary Asiatic hawker. The “ evidences ”
of the Theosophist are very much like those of the
alleged ancient relic-monger who had in a bottle a
sample of the darkness that Moses was in when
the light went out.
Dear Bulletin, —The press, prominent
citizens, and even clergy of Melbourne are at
present suffering from a virulent attack of muliero-
mania. The bicycle, with its shameless revelation
of the fact that women have legs, is the root of the
evil. Leading articles, addresses, sermons, have
been written, spoken, and preached upon the
subject. Never before, within the memory
of man, was Woman, as an animal, so freely, fully
and liquorishly discussed. And, what is still
more curious, she delights and exults in this
public vivisection. She even rushes, barelegged,
so to speak, into the controversy. Why should I
not wear trousers ? she asks in letters plaintive,
querulous, indignant, published in the papers:
reminding one of Sterne’s starling—“l can’t get
out! (says she) I can’t get out ” —of petticoats.
But out of them she is determined to get, sooner
or later, and in spite of the opposition of men.
“Man,” she says, “has for ages kept the lower
part of me undefined, and, in fact, makes me a
kind of longshore mermaid —until he marries me.”
Quite so. Yet Man, though anything but a sage in
some respects, is a very wise animal in regard to this
question. He knows what attracts him, and an
unerring instinct tells him that Woman clothed
only in her anatomic charms is an unreliable
incentive to the propaga ion of the species in a
direct line. For ages he has diligently fostered
and cherished the fond illusion that Woman, col-
lectively, has a small head and long legs. All the
antique statues have these gifts. It is so with
modern ones. Canova’s Venus has long legs —or
rather legs proportioned according to the mascu-
line ideal—which, probably, his model, Pauline
Buonaparte, had not. Thorwaldsen’s Venus
(finest of modern statues of the goddess) is also
long-legged. Look at any ideal picture of a nude
girl or woman and you find the same thing. Look
at a real picture of a South Sea Island,
African, or other aboriginal (virgin) female
and you find something very like it. But
in the case of the civilised woman society
has (with tight-laced stomachers, cross-straps,
and corsets as the fashions evoluted) in-
sisted that she should l’epress and literally keep
down the fact that she has bowels and an epigastric
region. Whose fault ? The fault of woman, most
emphatically. The male of the sex likes to clasp
a slender waist, but he is not —if the other party
to the transaction had eyes to see it—troubled
about two or three inches over the regulation 19 to
22 inches of girth. A little more is, in such
circumstances, not too much of a good thing for
him. But the female of the sex thinks —or, rather,
used to think—otherwise. The result in the course
of centuries has been —short legs. It does seem a
pity that this should be so, and the press, pro-
minent citizens, and pulpits of Melbourne deliver
j themselves in almost passionate terms to the effect
1 that this horrible fact should not be made un-
j necessarily—bicyclically—public. If Woman only
j knew what was good for her, from the strictly
marriageable point of view, she would take the
I hint. Married women (who have not one eye
directed towards the Divorce Court) may ride the
bicycle in any costume that pleases them. It is
their own particular funeral with which nobody,
except, perhaps, their husbands, is likely to inter-
fere. With girls and unmarried women it is
another affair. Mere contact, howsoever slight,
in theatres, trams, trains and churches, with deli-
cately half-concealed, half-suggested feminine
lower limbs (phrase dear to the penny-novelette
writers !) daintily draped, has made many an in-
flammable young man tie the nuptial knot under
, his ear. But who would be stirred to thoughts of
love by contact with one of a pair of tweed
knickerbockers, though they covered the legs of
Aphrodite? Mystery (carefully cultivated by
man) is the chief charm of woman —in the eyes of
the male of her sex. The bloomer costume, if it
should ever become popular amongst women, will,
I fancy, go far towards solving the Malthusian
problem.—Yours, Creeve Roe.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
\\T E teg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.
▼ ▼ Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-out No. 1,” “ Cameo ” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held bv
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ TIELIRIEIE CASTLES” and “ CAPSTAN".”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Hills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

Here’s to the land of the whiteman and yellow,
The copper-hued scions of islands afar !
The land of the flat-nosed, high-smelling black-
fellow,
Whom soap never touches in cake or in bar !
Here’s to the land where the leper may leaven
The life of the composite race with his sin,
Till flesh of one flesh the blent mass reeks to
Heaven
And pleads in Australia’s name to go in !
Here’s to the land where the barrister fattens
On fees never worked for by voice or by pen ;
The land where the small-eyed solicitor battens
On thick-headed women and thick-headed men!
Here’s to the land where the quack in his carriage
Takes toll with both hands of the sick and the
well ;
The land where the maid-volunteer strikes a
marriage
For sake of a home where the Seven Sins dwell !
Here’s to the land where such hosts of uncanny
And brain-aching laws load the tables of stone
I hat few care to tackle reform, and the many
Proclaim the philosophy—“ Leave us alone ' ”
GAMMA.
X.Z. : “It is a common belief among
* practical ’ bushmen that the young kangaroo is
not born in the ordinary way, but is produced on
the teat, which is all bosh. In the first place,
dissection of the doe shows that there is no pos-
sible means for it to pass internally from the
womb to the teat. Further, Pinkert at the
Frankfort Zoo saw the whole process. The
embryo was born in the ordinary way —the doe
distended the pouch with her forepaws, lifted the
embryo with her lips, and placed the budding
joey on the teat. ‘ Practical ’ bushmen don’t see
births, and, because they only find the joey in the
pouch, assert that it never was anywhere else.
Their belief is honestly held, but is anatomically
and obstetrically impossible ”
Those who are searching for Australian
etymology should not neglect the peculiarly
interesting geographical names of this upside-
down continent, to say nothing of the aboriginal
names—-the derivations of which are by no means
as unprintable as many of the more beautiful
Maori names. There are myriads of names of
gullies, creeks, hills, flats, “ points,” plains, &c.,
especially about deserted goldfields, the origin of
which will be quite untraceable a few years hence.
Murderer’s Flat, Canadian Gully, Belltopper
Gully, Old Man Gully, Fiery Creek, Frenchman’s,
Poverty Point, Mt. Misery, Black Hill (now one
of the whitest) are samples from one small dis-
trict. And there are probably materials for future
Australian romances, &c., in such names as Cape
Catastrophe, Kidnappers’ Point, Coffin Bay, Lake
Amadeus, Plains of Promise, &c., &c.

It is exceedingly gratifying to the Board that we are to-day able to announce to you that, with
the exception of £17,000 of which notice of repayment had been given, but has not expired, the whole
of the deferred deposits have been released, and that we have now no deposits bearing interest beyond
the current rates ruling for money lodged for periods of one and two years. Under the arrangement
made in June, 1893, the deferred deposits would, on the 31st December last, have amounted to about
nine millions, mostly maturing in 1898 and the three following years, and, although we have released
these deposits, the Balance-sheet shows greater strength than any we have yet presented. The action
of the Board will, I feel sure, have the cordial approval of the Proprietors. The coin and bullion and
liquid assets amount to £3,232,000, and would under ordinary circumstances be considered unduly
large, but nothing short of a position of exceptional strength would have justified the Board in
tendering payment, during the past half-year, of deferred deposits to the extent of 3J millions, nor is
it to be regretted that, at a time of universal unrest, we find ourselves in so strong a position.
In other respects the business of the Bank continues to be well maintained; the deposits, not-
withstanding large payments made of released deposits, show an increase, and the extension by
,£62,000 of the note circulation of the Bank denotes greater activity.
The hope expressed by me in July last of a probable increase in the prices of wool and other
Australian products has been realised ; but, unfortunately, the increased values have been to a great
extent neutralised by a dry summer following on a hard winter having caused losses among the flocks
and herds of the colony; the c-lip> of wool, too, although fetching higher prices, has been less in
quantity.
It now only remains for me, in using for the last time the words “ deferred deposits,” to express
the heartfelt thanks of the Shareholders to the thousands of customers and friends of the Bank, k>
whose good feeling and unabated confidence we owe the speedy and final removal of every disability.
I congratulate the Proprietors on the present position of the Bank, and beg to move “ That the
Report and Statements of Account be received, adopted, and circulated among the Proprietors.”
Mr. Robinson asked whether the Board intended to pay the dividends in future free of income
tax, as was the practice, he believed, in other places.
The Chairman said that the Board had that day decided to do so.
Mr. J. Mullens moved a vote of thanks to the Board for their successful management of the
company’s affairs. He thought that the comfortable position they now occupied was due to the
intelligence and financial ability displayed by the Board and general management of the Bank.
The Hon. A. H. Jacob seconded the motion, and it was carried unanimously.
The Chairman, in acknowledging the vote of thanks, said that last half-year he ventured to express
the hope that they would soon be able to pay off a further amount of their deferred deposits. He did
not expect to be able to do much in the past half-year. Of the £3,500,000 remaining at that time he
thought at the most they might clear off £2,000,000. That they had paid off the whole amount was
due entirely to their excellent General Manager, Mr. Dibbs. Some of them were not quite so young
as they used to be, and not so inclined to take risks as in former days. Their General Manager,
however, was confident not only of his ability, but of the safety of giving notice of the prepayment of
the entire amount, and the result had shown the soundness of his judgment, and they were very glad
that it was so. Every condition of the reconstruction scheme had been fulfilled.
Mr. T. A. Dibbs (th.e General Manager), on behalf of the staff, acknowledged the vote. He
thought the thanks of the shareholders were due to the Board for the fact that the value of the stock
was so high as it was, being at a premium of £6OO/ '0", for had it not been for their wisdom in providing
for the prepayment of the deferred deposits, their shares would have been much less in value. And in
looking to the welfare of the shareholders also, they had regard to the public interest, for in prepaying
the deposits they had the more promptly restored banking to its normal conditions. (“ Hear, hear.”)
He again thanked them on behalf of the staff.

Very few Australian Tories have any idea
that the much-abused idea of a State Loan De-
partment is borrowed from slow, Conservative
Britain. Under the Irish Land Purchase system
the State advances money to small Irish farmers,
to enable them to buy their holdings. It doesn’t
advance only 50 or 60 per cent, either, but lends
the whole value in one act. And the scheme works
so well that out of .£200,000 which recently fell due,
less than £BOOO was in arrear, and even that small
sum was only a few months overdue.
A queer case puzzling New York doctors
looks like “acromegaly” complicated with
four or five other diseases. A Polish Jew, John
Molansky, 41 years old, was sound and healthy up
to six years ago, when he became subject to
frequent terrific headaches. Presently his jaws
became misshapen and overgrown, all the bony
parts of the head became much larger, the bridge
of his nose widened and his nostrils became farther
apart, his cheek-bones grew very prominent, his
hair grew coarser and his voice completely changed.
Likewise his hands and feet developed to twice
their former size, and his stomach only retained
food with difficulty. There is a Melb. clergyman
who is developing acromegaly. Already his cheek-
bones, chin, hands and feet have increased ab-
normally and are still growing.

Australian honey is not an unmitigated
success in London, its flavor being the chief source
of complaint. Too much taste of eucalyptus is
the grumble. Now, right here is the chance for
some enterprising man. Eucalyptus extract is
A 1 for colds, coughs, influenza, sore throat and the
like, and honey is an excellent lubricant for tender
throats in winter. Just take Australian honey,
add a little more eucalyptus flavoring, and you
have the very thing for the English market,

I I ' OR matrimonially-inclined women who are not
as young as they ought to be, mining fields are not
the worst places in the world. Miners see so little
of women that they are perhaps less fastidious
than dwellers in settled districts.
Be this as it may, few of the hotels on the Tas-
manian silver-fields in their boom days could
“ keep a girl. ” Barmaids of certain and uncertain
age, housemaids, female servants of every degree
and variety of beauty almost invariably, within a
month or two of their arrival from “ town,”
married somebody and made their respective
spouses happy or unhappy, as the Fates ordered.
So rapidly were the knots tied that in many in-
stances marriage took place before the lovers had
time to build houses for their brides. In such
cases the newly-made wives lodged at the hotels
where they had served before marriage.
In one particular instance no less than six
newly-married women had quarters at one hotel.
In the grey dawn of a chilly morning a fire started,
known since as “ the fire that burned the post-
office.”
The startled women, covering themselves withi
what was nearest to hand, hurried out of the hotel
and stood in the street. The flames got fair hold:
of the big wooden buildings and made the sur-
rounding scene as bright as day. One bride of six
weeks had stuck her naked feet into a pair of
slippers and thrown a man’s macintosh over the-
snowy robes of night. In her hurry she had left,
her front teeth in the wash-basin, and, taken alto-
gether, she did not look particularly inviting. To'
her came her husband. He gazed intently at her
for some moments, and then said, bitterly and
loudly enough to be heard by a dozen bystanders::
“ If I had seen you as you are now six weeks;
ago before I would have married you I’d have
chopped off your head with a axe.”

The city fathers of Sydney are a curious
lot. For five nights in each month the street-
lamps are not lighted on the ground that the full
moon is sufficient illumination. So long as there
is a moon in the almanac the fathers are satisfied.
But sometimes it happens that a dense mass of
cloud wipes out the alleged orb, and then Sydney,
after the shops close, or on a Sunday evening
when they don’t open, is a city of ink and murky
shadows, and George-street looks like a black gash
cut in a land of coal, and the only break in the
darkness is a glimmer in the far distance- where a
drunk is trying to hold up a match so as to deci-
pher the name at a corner. Apart from that occa-
sional match the N.S. W. capital is a city of ghosts
and black crape, and the soft-footed person who
tries to grab your watch as you pass an alley looks
among the shadows like a monstrous ghoul the
size of a mainmast; and when it rains in addition
to the other sins the people silently slopping
along the pavement look like shadows damned in a
shower-bath in an extinct world, and most of the
time you only know where you are through the
sound of some one spitting at a corner.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was in the Bourke district on that fatal Mon-
day—or let me now say, one of those fatal Mon-
days. Mac. and I were driving a two-horse sulky
down one of the back tracks to the Culgoa. We
had started at dawn, the air as hot as a summer’s
noon, and had changed horses thrice in 00 miles.
Whenever we had met water, we had stopped,
soaked bags, and laid these on our horses’ blister-
ing bodies. Every few miles we pulled the horses
up and spelled ; a few miles of hard driving would
have killed them.
It was silent and distressing, that journey.
Mac drove, full of sad thoughts; his brother, on
the previous day, had dropped dead from heat-
apoplexy. And I, unused to the bush, felt lost in
an immense furnace. I lay back, half-stifled,
scorched, blinded, too exhausted to speak or think.
An hour or so after noon, as we went with little
noise over the sandy track, two emus stalking
through the gidyah and balah took my notice and
roused me a little. I sat up and looked at
our thermometer ; it reached 155° in the sun. I
leaned back again ; the cushion, struck for a few
moments by the sun, now burnt my back like a
fire. And gradually getting overcome, I lapsed
into a kind of fevered dream.
I felt, or dreamt, that Mac.’s arm pressed mine
as he pulled the horses a little on one side of the
track. I felt that something had caught his atten-
tion, had held it; somehow I knew he was look-
ing down past his wheel at the track, studying it.
And with his arm still pressing close against mine
I saw a strange vision. A hot, barren plain; a
few bleached bones; a little mound, the head of
which was marked by a rude cross. Then all
faded into the blackest night, a night of silence,
of desolation, broken at fitful intervals by a
dismal cawing.
Mac. ’s arm pressed so tightly that it awakened
me. He was looking at the track, and with deep
earnestness. It impressed me so that I feared
to speak. After a few moments he, without
moving, said very slowly and solemnly, “A man
has gone along here to-day ; not long ago, either ;
he is leading a horse ; they are both knocked up ;
they’ve got a dog with them.” I looked down
at the straggling tracks which, meaningless to me,
had told the bush-master their story. ‘ ‘ See—here
are the man’s tracks ; he can scarcely put one foot
before the other; the horse is dragging his hind
feet; the small tracks are the dog’s. They are not
very far ahead, but they are in a bad way ; we
must push on. I wonder if they know where
water is ? There’s some two miles or so beyond
next boundary-fence, perhaps.''
So we went on, Mac. watching. We reached
and passed a gidyah under which the three had
rested ; I could perceive the tracks there quite
plainly. “ Are they still on the track ? ” I asked.
“ Fair on it,” answered Mac. ; “ but the boundary-
gate is two miles along ; I suppose if they know
of the Gilgie they will make for that; but God
knows if there’s any water in it.” We drove on
silently again for half-a-mile. “ By God ! ” ex-
claimed Mac., “ the horse is dead done ; he’s
dragging his fore-feet now.” And he whipped up
our own jaded horses. We were getting near the
g .te, the track winding in and out through the
scrub. As we caught a glimpse of the boundary-
fence Mac. stood up, and a few seconds after ex-
claimed : “The gate’s stopped them; there
they are in a heap.” And, all of a sudden,
liis face distorting with rage, he threw; me the
reins, snatched my gun from its case, loaded it,
aimed and fired. Down from a tree near the
bodies fell three dead or wounded crows, while a
dozen more flew up cawing. “Curse you !”
shouted the bushman. “ Curse you, you vermin !
you’ll pay for your feast this time.”
Theliorse, a bay, lay against the gate, on his left
side; his legs outstretched, his neck straight, hiseyes
half-open and glazed. The saddle and bridle
were gone, but their sweat-marks were on him.
“ Dead half-an-hour !” said Mac. Pressed close
with his back to the horse’s breast, with legs
doubled, and his head resting on the horse’s under-
neath foreleg, lay the black collie dog. He had
died in the little patch of shade which his dead
mate’s body had given him. A crow, uninjured
but for its broken wing, took frightened hops close
by, or paused to gasp with wide-open bill.' I
would have killed it, but the bushman stopped
me. “No! no ! let him know what it is to die of
thirst while his gang peck his eyes out. Let him
die hearing the caw ! caw ! and seeing the black
devils hopping down to their feed ! ”
“But the man ! ” said Mac., “ where is the
man ! ” He has pulled off the saddle and bridle
and planted them. Here are his tracks—drive
the sulky while I follow them. He’s making for the
Gilgie, but, God help him, the poor devil is dog-
tired. Keep your eyes about you up there. ” So
with heart panting, and eyes searching, I followed
slowly after Mac.
There, beside the Gilgie, which was all mud,
the man was crouched with his face in his hands,
his hands on his knees. He was all blue mud ; he
had crawled into the Gilgie and out again. We
raised his head, his face covered with mud ; we
opened his mouth—it was full of mud. We took
this mud out, washed his mouth, forced water
down his throat. But he remained unconscious,
scarcely breathing. We washed the mud out of
his eyes, out of his nose, we washed his hands, we
fanned him. “By God ! he’s going ! ” said Mac.,
“ lift him into the sulky and we’ll take him to the
station.”
After we got him there he hung in the balance
for an hour or so ; then slowly he came round.
He opened his eyes, looked up at Mac., who was
fanning him, and spoke. “The horse! is he
dead ? ”
“ Yes,” answered Mac., “ wasn't he dead when
you left him ? ”
“No ! but he wouldn’t come any further ; we
shared our last drop of water, the tnree of us, but
it was no good to the horse--he wouldn’t come
past the gate. And the dog ?—the dog ? ”
“Dead, too!” said Mac.—“dead beside the
horse. ”
The man shivered and closed his eyes. Then he
looked up and spoke again. “ Carlo followed me
20 yards, then he went back to his other mate. I
couldn’t call him—l was too done. I didn’t like
him leaving me ;it broke me up, that! I don’t
remember anything afterwards, except that I was
struggling on thinking 1 saw water ahead-of me,
and making for it. But I don’t recollect anything
for sure from the time the dog left me until I saw
you fanning me just now.”
Mac.’s eyes were full of tears as he motioned me
aside. “Ah! ” he said, “you can’t understand it,
you’re not a bushman; you can’t, imagine the bond
of friendship there is between that stranger and
me! ”

“ A QUEER-looking specimen, allright.”
So the boys said when he struck the camp one
pay-day—stone-broke, hungry and worn-out.
Long Tom Fegan, the flash Victorian, took him
in and tuckered him, and next day he took us all
down at “ two-up.”
We were a bit short-handed at this time (an
unusual thing on railway contracts), so it was not
difficult for him to get a start, and for all his new -
chum looks he could do a good day’s work. He
drew d£9 that pay, and next month he did full
time, too.
Fegan and he continued mates all this time, and
now, seeing an opening, Burns, with his own bit
of money augmented by the loan of a tenner from
Fegan, opened a store at the camp. His luck
stuck to him ; and when the cutting was done and
the gang went further along he shifted his store to
the big camp at Forty-Mile, where his business in-
creased twofold.
Fegan was reckoned to be the best hand at
loading and lighting holes on the job. But the
best of us get badly left sometimes.
The last explosion had taken place, and the
grey veil of smoke was rising slowly off the face of
the cutting, but on a bank close by, where rough
but loving hands had placed him, lay a maimed and
bleeding man over whose face a greyer and more
terrible veil was slowly but surely being drawn —
the veil of death.
A hurried footstep, a passage opens through
the crowd, and Burns, the storekeeper, bending
over, softly touches the battered mass. Slowly
the poor burnt eyes open, and now a gleam of
pleased recognition flits over that disfigured face,
and a hoarse and broken whisper reaches the ear
of the sobbing storekeeper, “ Good-bye—mate—
you’ll do—all—right—stick to —the store.”
Pay-day again, and as the paymaster calls out
each man’s name he steps forward for his money.
“ Fegan ! ” The storekeeper answers to the name
by stepping forward, and handing up a folded
paper.
“My account is three pounds for tucker, sir,
and a couple of pounds I loaned him in the two-
up school. ”
Coroner Youl : “ I knew a man who had a
bottle of whisky pumped out of him after every-
body who knew him had declared he was the
steadiest man in the world.” What of it? Some
men get disguised in liquor, others simply disguise
the' liquor. The man who could maintain a
reputation for temperance with a bottle of whisky
inside him must have been about as steady as
they make ’em.
Eleven British peers are now acting a s
Mayors of as many English towns, and an immense
number of eminent commoners are employed in a
similar capacity. Great Britain is waking up to
the fact that municipal councils can do more solid
good than the over-burdened Parliament, which is
too much hampered by the dead weight of Party
Government to achieve anything in particular ;
and the days are past when the chief qualifications
for an alderman were a large stomach, a thick
head, a want of aspirates, and a capacity for eat-
ing gravy with a knife. In Australia, however,
these are the chief qualifications to this day. A
thick, solid, obscure man with large feet is this
country’s typical alderman.

Old hat, though I do want a new one,
I can’t bear to throw you aside,
For you’ve proved a good friend and a true one
On many a blazing hot ride.
Each rip in your crown tells a story
Of gallops o’er mountain and flat ;
Each patch is a record of glory,
My gallant old cabbage-tree hat.
You’ve streaked it by moonlight, old fellow,
When the cattle were going like smoke ;
You have heard the scrub bull’s ringing bellow
In his strongholds of brig’low and oak.
You’ve been soaked in the floods on the Dawson,
Cut to ribbons and tramped nearly flat
By the bullocks that broke at the Crossing—
My hardy old cabbage-tree hat.
Though your crown has been fixed up with leather
And I’ve sewn you with horsehair and string,
We no longer shall foot it together
When the mustering starts, in the Spring.
Your journey is ended —rest peacefully there.
When I, in my turn, come to that,
I trust life will close with a record as fair
As yours, my old cabbage-tree hat.
