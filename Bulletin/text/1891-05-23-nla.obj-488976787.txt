a soothing, healing and emollient milk for the faca

more effectually than any other preparation, and pro-
duces soft fair skin, and a lovely delicate complexion ;

, The extraordinary repul ation of Rowland’s Macassar
Oil, Kalydor and Odonto, induces some shopkeepers to
offer spurious imUations.under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland & Sons, of 20,
Hatton Garden, London, and therefore it is bjgbly
necessary to buy no Macassar Oil, Kalydor or Odonto
except thoBo made by them, and which bear their
name in red ink on the wrappers.

I
This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chiei
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his rnedibal education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness dm i ng
ihe day, circles round the eyes, Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the e ves,
bashfulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains
in the back. Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the ears and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hack ug
cough, who ca: not marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness; and other symptoms which lead to in-
f anity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of fid. in
s 1 amps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage
FREE, A- LARGE CLOTH-ROUND

Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILIT Y. Should you require med cal
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous., it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
deluding every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
opouion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
w ork, the price of which is but sixpence ; encli.sed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by Are,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

Dr. M. PERRY,

SPECIALIST for tlie Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical Baird of K.S. W. Lite House Sur-
geon to the Great northern Hospital, Londm.
I am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the treatment of this class of disease. but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
Chronic and Ncrvout Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph , Nov.
6th. 7th and Bth, 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified Men entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from these diseases, who are scattered over all parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike a blow at the Quackery which now exists, but I also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
. personal dignity.
Sly Qualifications I invite the fullest investigation into. For some considerable time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of otservin s the many phases of the Nervous and
Sexual System, and to become acquainted with the most scientific methods of effecting their cure.
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me he is informed at the
commencement whether X can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises and
if I undertake the case ’
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete aucl Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

SATURDAY, MAY 23, 1801.
The Voice of the People.
When the Voice of the People has made
itself heard on the subject of Federation,
and the politicians of Australia have come
back from their constituencies refreshed and
invigorated by large majorities, the work of
creating an Australian nation will enter on a
new stage. So far tire business has been
merely of a preliminary character, but when
a general election has been successfully
tided over, and the statesmen of this great .
country have sanded then’ hands and secured
a fresh grip of the loaves and fishes, the
question" will be duly laid before Parlia-
ment, and actual legislation will commence.
Whether all the six Governments of Australia
will go through the form of consulting the
nation is, of course, a matter of uncertainty,
but probably the majority of them will do so.
The present is a dull season in politics, and
most of the rulers of this great people can
see a dissolution ahead and are unable to
raise a single feasible war-whoop with which
to go to the country. In fact, they are all in
this unpleasant situation, excepting Mr.
Forrest, of West Australia, who has only
just commenced his new career, and Sir
Henry Parkes, who is over-burdened with
war-whoops of various kinds, most of which
he has used over and over again till they are
as old as Abraham. For at least five out of
the six Governments, however, Federation
is a blessing of no ordinary kind, and the
politician who wilfully used up such an
opportunity by passing the Federation Act
right off instead of getting through an elec-
tion with it—unless, indeed, he had no pro-
spect of getting through the election in any
case —would be too reckless to be v worth
calling a politician. An individual of that
description would make his guardian angel
into chicken-pie and eat him in his utter
regardlessness of consequences. Therefore,
the Voice of the People will doubtless be
appealed to, though no politician cares a
straw for the Voice of the People, and there
is no way in which the Voice can make itself
heard in any case, and when the utterance
comes no one will ever know what the People
were trying to say. And very probably the
people will bo equally ignorant, and the
whole affair will have just as much bearing
on the matter under discussion as a dogma
has upon a dog-fight, but politics are gener-
ally constructed that way, and it is the chief
glory of the Constitution that it arrives at
its purposes by a .process of muddlement
which defies all ordinary calculation and
comprehension.
* * *
If either the new Parliaments or the old
ones represented the votes of a majority of
the nation there might be some shadowy
possibility of arriving at an understanding as
to whether the Australian people want or do
not want Federation, or whether they want
this particular kind of Federation, or whether
they have actually realised the meaning of
Federation at all; though even in that case
the possibility would be shadowy indeed.
As it is, however, the average Parliament
merely represents the party which is best
organised, quite irrespective of numbers. In
an electorate which, contains 10,000 voters
about 6000 may possibly go to the poll, and
the “ well-organised ” party which commands
2000 votes and puts up one candidate can
win easily. The disorganised party with
4000 votes meanwhile wastes its forces by
dividing, them among three or four candi-
dates, some of them probably put up by the
secret influence of the other side, and goes
to hopeless wreck. Organisation and dis-
reputable swindling, in fact, are generally
convertible terms ; and the only way in
which the sense of the nation can be ascer-
tained is by a system of election by absolute
majorities, and by the arrest' and imprison-
ment of anybody who is found “organising
any party as the term is now understood.
The present system is one of the many
elements of confusion which make it impos-
sible to settle the Federation question by
what is termed an appeal to the nation, and-
thc system of Government by Party adds
additional complexity to the situation. The
one essential axiom of the Constitution
which Australia imported from England is
that there must be two parties which hold
office turn-about, and the method of con-
ducting business is that one of these parties
should rise and make an assertion, and that
the other should get up and say that it is a
liar. An individual who got up and said
that both parties were liars would form a
third section and would be neither Govern-
ment nor Opposition, and however well-
grounded his statement might be he would
be excluded from office and authority,
no matter which side was in power.
And, on the other hand, an individual
who asserted that both parties were
partly correct would bo despised and
scouted as a vacillating individual and a
t "im.ncr, for the only road to political
greatness consists in going the whole hog on
the party programme. Consequently, the
average -.politician dues go the whole hog,
with disastrous results. When new Parlia-
ments are elected, the men who have got
the salaries will probably announce that the
programme of the session will consist of the
Federation of Australia, the squashing of
•shearers who go on strike, female suffrage,
the construction of 1000 miles of unprofitable
railway, a new loan, and a big deficiency,
and the men who want the salaries will get
up and assert that the Government is a liar
in the good old way which is provided for
by the Constitution. Some of them will
probably do this by reason of the anti-Labour
legislation, and some on account of the female
suffrage, and some because of the loan, and
others for various reasons, but it is the great
principle of all legislation that the Opposition
must contradict everything under all cir-
cumstances whatsoever*. And in like manner
the Government party is also bound to go
the whole, animal, and therefore some will
vote for Federation for the sake of a new
railway, and others-will vote for the new
railways for the sake of Federation, and
some will vote for everything merely because
the party tells them to. The whole scheme
of Government by contradiction falls through
as soon as members cease to vote in a bald-
headed, comprehensive way according to
directions, for in a House of 150 members
it is impossible to find 80 men who can
conscientiously agree on everything, and
70 who can as conscientiously disagree, and,
therefore, the present method succeeds
because the politician lives by disguising his
sentiments, and for no other reason what-
soever. The individuals who propose to take
“ the sense of the country ” on the Federa-
tion question might do well to begin by
taking the sense of the Legislatures, that
being much the smaller undertaking of the
twoq and they might thereby form some
idea of the difficulties of the situation.
But the”difficulty of getting a definite and
sincere expression of opinion from Parlia-
ment is as nothing compared with the diffi-
culty of getting an expression of any kind
from the nation. For the Constitution has
so tangled matters up that the nation cannot
by any possibility express itself defihitely
about anything. The People cannot vote for
Federation or against it, for there is abso-
lutely no means of doing either—they can only
vote for or against the men who want to
federate, which is a very different thing. In
New South Wales, for example, all the lead-
ing men of one party will go to the poll on
the programme of Freetrade and Federation,
while the other party will travel on Protec-
tion and Federation, and the only way to
vote against Federation is to vote against
both Protection and Freetrade. Under
such conditions there is nothing to vote for.
If the country wants Freetrade it has no.
possible chance of explaining whether it
wants it with or without Federation, unless
the Freetrade party puts up a Federal and
an anti-Federal candidate for every seat, and
in that case the country would not get
Freetrade however much it wanted it, for
by splitting the party vote Protection would
triumph all along the line. In like manner
if it wants Protection it is impossible to
define whether it wants Federation along
with it or not. In Victoria, too, Gillies
and Munro have both declared for Federa-
tion, and each has hauled his followers along
with him, so that the only way to oppose
Federation is to fire both sections out of the
House bodily, and create a new party and
find a new set of leaders. And as the nation
obviously cannot start an entire new batch
of legislators at such short notice it must
accept the scheme of the Sydney Convention
whether it wants such a thing or not. The
System by which a nation is unable to
express its opinion on a single point except
by throwing away an entire Parliament is no
doubt wasteful and hideously absurd, but
this ghastly mockery is the great feature of
the Constitution. If a man ran himself on
the same principle he would throw himself
away whenever he wanted his hair cut, and
as a natural consequence the human race
would presently become extinct.
# # *
Amid all these complications the Voice of
the People becomes an exceedingly husky
and uncertain voice, and one that is hard to
understand. For instance, in a city which
returns three representatives there are pro-
bably five candidates, and as the elector is
not allowed to vote straight out either for or
against any particular measure by means of
the plebiscite or referendum , he can only
express his sentiments by voting for three
out of the five. One of them is possibly an
advocate of Protection, Federation, and
rampant teetotalism ; another plunges for
Federation, Imperialism, and Freetrade;
and a third for provincialism, independence,
and liquor. Then, in all probability, the
fourth man is conspicuous chiefly for bigoted
Orangeism, female suffrage, and a desire to
suppress drink by Act of Parliament, and
cares not one cent whether Australia is
federated or not; and the remaining one is
an individual who will vote either Protec-
tion or Freetrade, so long as Federation is
accomplished “ under the Crown,'’ and the
Day of Rest is kept holy by law or violence,
and there is a new railway swindle and a
fresh Land Act. Then the individual whose
creed is composed chiefly of the three axioms
—Federation, Protection to local industries,
and independence, is turned loose upon the
assemblage to decide how his three votes
shall be distributed. He may vote for No. 1
because of his advocacy of Protection and
Federation and let the independence slide in
his case, and for No. 3 on account of his
advocacy of independence, and let the
Federation and Protection slide ; and then
probably the only thing left to do would be
to give the remaining vote to No. 2.
Consequently, in the effort to give a
definite answer on the question of Aus-
tralian Unity, and yet to keep as close
as possible to the rest of his principles, thus
one individual would vote for protection,
teetotalism, liquor, freetrade, federation, im-
perialism, independence, and anti-federation.
And yet even this elaborate confusion is only
the first beginning of the difficulty, for when
the three members enter the House they
have to divide themselves between two
parties, and very often they won’t fit in with
either. The Government, it may be, pins its
faith to federation, protection, and'independ-
ence, and the Opposition, out of that in-
herent cussedness which is essential to
politics, believes in provincialism, imperial-
ism, freetrade, and liquor. Therefore, if
the secondlnember’s freetrade is his strongest
point he throws federation overboard and
joins the Opposition, and the third may
abandon provincialism and join the Govern-'
mient for the sake of independence, or else
he may abandon the theory of independence
and join the Opposition for the sake of pro-
vincialism. Whatever he does he must help
to bring ruin on one of his principles, for it
is part of the superlative foolishness of the
Constitution that the Legislature cannot adopt
one part of the Government programme and
reject another ; it must take the whole lot, _
or, failing that, the Government is bound to'
pack up its programme, and its carpet-bag,
and quit. And it very often happens when
a member sacrifices one of his principles as
the only way to maintain another, that the
principle he sacrifices is the only one which
his constituents value, and that the one he
hangs on to is & principle which the same
constituents would rather have done without.
It is by possibilities like these that Aus-,
tralia is governed. The community which
has a leaning towards Protection and Federa-
tion often finds itself called upon td choose
between a Protectionist who won’t federate
arid a Freetrader who will. If its desire
for Federation is its strongest point, it pro-
bably accepts the latter individual ; and
when he gets into the House and finds that
he must sacrifice one of his principles because
Federation and Protection are on one party's,
programme, and Freetrade and provincialism
on the other, he may easily throw over the
wrong principle, however great his desire to
keep faith with his supporters, for the suffi-
cient reason that these same supporters
never had any opportunity to explain the
exact reason why they elected him. There-
fore the electorate which desired to vote
Protection and Federation may find its re-
presentative doing his level best to carry out
its wishes by voting for provincialism and
Freetrade. Even if there were only two-
principles to put before the country, such a
complication may easily come about, but
when the issue is also mixed up with ques-
tions of local government, land and suffrage
problems, religious differences, and ix dozen
other matters, the Voice of the’ People
becomes altogether extinct. And even if all
the Governments of Australasia go to the
country on the subject of Federation, it is
more than doubtful if a single one of them
will come back with any more distinct idea
of the popular sentiment than it possesses
to-day.
As a remedy for this difficulty it has been
suggested that the Federation Bill should be
submitted to a direct vote of the Australian
people in order that it might be decided
entirely apart from all other considerations,
but even this is only the beginning of a solu-
tion of the great .problem. A popular vote
would, no doubt show a majority in favour of
Australian Unity, but whether the Federa-
tion Party wanted this kind of Federation
or some other and totally distinct variety,
there would be nothing whatever to show.
The voter who desired to get rid of the
incubus of an Upper House, or to establish
a Federal Court which would be absolutely
free from foreign interference, or who de-
murred to the weirdly absurd principle that
the highest position in the Australian Com-
monwealth should be reserved for foreigners
only, would be debarred from any expres-
sion of opinion on these and many other
important points ; and if the nation gave its
vote for Federation under such circumstances
that fact would merely prove that it con-
sidered it as the less of two evils. The only
method by ivhich the wishes of the people
can be accurately ascertained is by taking a
vote on each separate principle of the great
scheme. And even then the poll would be
of little account unless plural voting were
abolished, and the suffrage extended on
equal terms to every Australian citizen, and
as no politician has yet arisen to suggest such
a scheme it can only be assumed that the
Voice of the People, so expressed, is a thing
which the average placeman has no desire to
hear. And the one thing which is abso-
lutely certain among a great number of un-
certainties is that, as a means of testing the
opinion of the nation, a dissolution is of
about as much avail as. a dog-fight.
“The Thin End of the Wedge.”
Premier Munro, in his compound capacity
as a capitalist, a friend and worshipper of
every description of Property, and an
advanced Liberal, has undertaken that in
the next session of'the Victorian Parliament
he will introduce the thin end of the wedge
in the matter of female suffrage. He admits
frankly that woman lias as much right as
man to run the State, and that the alleged
“Shrieking Sisterhood,” which demands the
enfranchisement of woman, is no more an
object of derision than the Shrieking
Brotherhood, which includes such names as
Washington, Hampden, Bolivar and
IliBNZi, and which put forward exactly the
same demands on the part of man. The
dismal picture of the whole feminine race
abandoning cookery and other household
duties, and leaving the dishes unwashed and
the neglected infant in the sink, in order to
rush after politics, he freely acknowledges
to be as irrational as the picture of the entire
male population dropping its shovel and its
pickaxe, and flying ea masse from its engines
and shops and banks and counting-houses
for the same purpose. So far as the present
system ijs concerned, he has committed him-
self to the policy of One-Man-One-Vote, and
he openly avers that the policy of . One-
Woman-6ne-Vote is equally reasonable.
Therefore, when a deputation waited upon
him the other day and invited him, as the
head and front of a knock-kneed Cabinet,
to put his principles into effect, a good deal
was expected of him, and yet very little was
realised. He promised, indeed, to insert
the thin end of the wedge by extending the
franchise to all female ratepayers —in other
words, to all women with property; but
when he was pressed to do more than this,
he took refuge in that old, time-worn gag
about the necessity of avoiding _ precipitate
action ; and amid much hazy drivel of this
sort, the deputation grasped its umbrella
and left. And as it retired, there floated
out behind it the accents of a persuasive
though husky voice, like that of an indi-
vidual who was parched with the drought or
a long line of teetotal ancestors, which
besought the deputation to beware of undue
haste, and to move gradually, and to insert
the thin end of the wedge, and to keep an
eye on the old landmarks of the constitution
generally.
* * *
It is of old, second-hand drivel like this
that Munro’s Liberalism is constructed, an ,
considering the results arrived at, it won
be better for the women, as well as the r
of Victoria, if he were only a commo ,
beastly Conservative after all. As a 0
servative he might have refused even to co
sider the subject of feminine suffrage, a
the struggle between Property and buniuni y>
for supremacy in the Legislature, worn ,
continued on a comparatively even » *
As a Conservative, also, he wo i^ d ne .
refused his support to the One-Man-
Vote principle, but by-and-bye, the wo
of Victoria would have walked ° ve •
battered political carcase, and gamec
purpose without his aid or interfere!! •
once, and only once, Labour would prove
true to itself, and would cease to v
the array of lawyers, landlords, and ° d l^ in dle
who lie to it at every election, and

in the next Parliament, that it wo . et j ier

whatever. The contest lies
great mass of the nation on one » q ie
the other, money, political
multiplied votes of Property, ■ faking
advantages that are to be , The
electoral rolls and other swi


party of Capital is woefully deficient in
numbers, but it has prospered and run the
State by hard lying and newspaper influence
and business organisation, and that species
of cow-like ignorance which has always in-
duced the masses to vote as somebody told
them to ; yet there was always an uneasy
feeling abroad that one vigorous movement
on the part of Labour might upset its
supremacy at any moment. If Premier
Munro’s promised Bill should pass, how-
ever, and the multiplied vote of Property is
reinforced by the multiplied vote of Pro-
perty’s aged grandmother, and its sister, and
its wife, and its eleven maiden aunts, the
position of the ruling class becomes almost
unassailable. And the unspeakable irony of
the situation is that the ancient water-drinker,
while thus giving Capital the biggest lift it
has got in nearly half a century, does it
solely because- he is an advanced Liberal,
and a vociferous friend of Labour ! He will
travel on it at elections, and howl about it at
democratic gatherings, and on the strength
of it he will rally up the fragments of the
Liberal party which Deakin led to such un-
speakable smash, and unless he spoils the
situation by some enormous blunder, the
nation in general will whoop for him as the
statesman who inserted the thin end of the
wedge, and who first recognised the true
meaning of equality. The Bulletin admits
frankly that it has hitherto underrated
Munro. It has cheerfully recognised his
narrow-mindedness, and the conspicuous
woodenness which seemed to make him such
fit material for lighting the office fire ; and
it has done full justice to the elephantine
clumsiness with which he crashes down
every object that comes in his way ; but
beyond these-he has never before developed
any qualities worth mentioning, and this
paper saw no reason to believe that he ever
would.
If the promised Female Suffrage Bill is
passed next session, and the One-Man-One-
Yote Bill can be talked out, or postponed, or
judiciously lost in the Upper House, where
its grave is even now yawning to receive it,
the prospects of the latter measure are not
likely to amount to much for some consider-
able time to come. For at the ensuing'
election the rolls will be crowded with the
names of all the capitalistic female relatives,
and the plural vote of the man of property
being reinforced by the plural vote of the
woman of property, Labour may readily
find itself in an actual minority. The
land-owner, who now counts as six or
sixteen or thirty - six separate human
beings at the poll, can easily multiply
his wife and daughter till they become
equally numerous, and the gain by this
process will be enormous. And when this
alleged reform is accomplished the principle
of Female Suffrage, in the democratic sense,
will probably be further from recognition
than ever. The feminine plutocrat no more
desires to extend any share of political
power to her poorer sisters than the male
plutocrat desires to share his authority on
equitable terms with the individual who has
no property and no bank account. The
average pastoralist is still as unable to com-
prehend why the shearer should have a vote
as he is to understand why the cow should
be similarly endowed, and his wife and
daughter are equally obtuse. The extension
of the franchise to the female with coin
means the creation of so many thousand
votes which will be used almost unanimously
against the extension of the franchise to the
woman without coin ; and both the male and
female plural voter will vote en masse
against the abolition of plural voting. If,
out of the two measures on which Premier
Munro’s reputation for Liberalism is based,
the Female Suffrage Bill is the first to
become law, the end of the Labour party in
Victoria will be incalculably worse than the
beginning. And, on the other hand, if
the One-Man-One-Vote measure should, by
any chance, get in ahead, it ' will be
practically neutralised, and there will be
hardly any appreciable gain whatever. In
the pne case Munro has given the cause of
Capital a gigantic lift ; in the other case he
has saved it from a gigantic loss ; and in both
cases he has secured the unbounded grati-
tude of the mass of the nation, and has
gained a reputation as an enlightened demo-
crat, on which any man, not endowed with
the most phenomenal stupidity, should be ■
able to travel for ten years, at the verv
lowest estimate.
There is no term in all the bright lexicon
drivel which has done better service than
that which concerns the “thin end of the
wedge.” There is no sense in it, and no
meaning, but it sounds solemn and plaintive
; UKI mysterious, like the bray of an ass
beard afar off at midnight, and in a general
lb seems to fill the bill. On the strength
expression it has come to be assumed
wiat when a great reform is urgently de-
bmndod, true wisdom consists in doing it by
mew, instalments and in shreds and patches,
J ust as a truly wise man might build up his
• lew coa t in a gradual way by joining together
fragments, one fragment
‘ U a dffle, in order that the coat might dawn
•pen him gradually and not upset the public
eliect by its too great suddenness. The
I u-pose of this is to “accustom the public
ind to the change,” which is eminently
perfluous, because it is only when
Public mind has accepted the' change,
vti j 0 P ub li c intelligence is showing
dcnfcly from behind, that the insertion of
c thin end of the wedge first begins. It is
also done to avoid the “ bbliteration of the
landmarks of the Constitution,” which is
entirely superfluous, for the landmarks of the
constitution are always being obliterated,
and besides very few know what these land-
marks are, and a great many people have
hardly begun to realise that there is a con-
stitution at all, and, anyhow, the country lives
on victuals, not on landmarks ; and, in addi-
tion to all this, most of the landmarks are of
a kind that the nation would gladly get rid
of. A dead horse or eight tons of bad eggs
might be a very good landmark in the centre
of a crowded city, and many a stranger
would probably find them convenient as a
means of letting him know his whereabouts,
but an individual who wanted them removed
very gradually on that account would be set
down as a lunatic all the same. The fact
that Munro advocates the granting of the
suffrage to women is a distinct admission on
his part that the withholding of that privilege
is an injustice, and consequently a public
danger, and the idea of retaining three-
quarters of a danger in order to create
safety is as imbecile as the idea of retaining
the largest part of an infection in order to
promote health. Yet this is ostensibly what
Munro proposes to do, and as almost every
other politician does exactly the same thing
the proceeding will doubtless pass for pro-
found wisdom. When an alleged statesman
recognises the existence of a great evil
it is for some unexplained reason, sup-
posed to be an evidence of deep sagacity,
to remove a fraction of it, and leave the rest
standing for fear the public should wake up
and cry for it in the night. Yet if the same
alleged statesman were assaulted and kicked
by four men, and si policeman removed one
of them by way of inserting the thin end of
the wedge, and left the other three to con-
tinue kicking, on the principle that the land-
marks of the constitution shouldn’t be
removed hurriedly, and for fear the mind of
the victim might be unsettled if he were
rescued too suddenly, the matter would pro-
bably be regarded in a somewhat different
light. And, in like manner, if a physician
declined to cure Munro or any other patient,
on the ground that his disease was one of
the principal landmarks in his constitution,
and therefore ought only to be shifted by
small instalments, there would doubtless be
a row very shortly afterwards. Possibly, if
Munro’s principle had been applied a little
earlier to Munro himself, that gentleman
might have appreciated the full beauty of it
more effectually. If the thin end of him had
been inserted in the Legislature instead of .
recklessly putting the whole of him in there
at once, and the thick end—which in his case
is undoubtedly the end with the head on it—
had been left outside, and the door had
slammed while he was in this precarious
position, the full significance of his own
policy might undoubtedly have been brought,
home to him for once, in all its comprehen-
sive absurdity.
Exit Johnston.
On last Monday morning the officials of Ballarat
Gaol, together with as many of the public as
desired to witness a punitive novelty and
could succeed in securing cards of admission,
witnessed a “chairing” of an unprecedented
character. It occured in connection with the
strangling of the felon Johnston, for murdering
his wife and four children last year. The
custom of “chairing” is an old one; but this
method of locomotion has hitherto been reserved
for persons who succeeded in obtaining the
approbation of their fellows by scholastic suc-
cess at universities or by political triumphs in
public. In Johnston’s case, on the contrary,
the method was resorted to for the purpose of
conveying him to the Ballarat gallows, from
which, a few minutes later, he was swung into
eternity. The plan was adopted in consequence
of his inability to cover the distance between the
condemned cell and the trap-door, owing to the
paralysis of his lower limbs. The whole pro-
ceedings in this case, from the consummation
of the quintuple murder of several months back,
to that of the solitary judicial murder of Mon-
day, so far exceed in ghastliness anything to be
found outside the bloodiest chapters in the
Newgate Calendar as to demand more than a
passing notice, if only for the purpose of bring-
ing home to Australians the character of the
penal code under which they live. As John-
ston’s lower extremities were paralysed, and
as the authorities had decided that his physical
disabilities remained incomplete whilst his neck
remained unbroken, the Ballarat sight-seers of
Monday were afforded a spectacle which it is to
be 1 mped will satisfy their cravings for sensation
and fortify their desire to preserve intact the
criminal status conferred upon them by British
and colonial legislation.
The main facts of the case are too well-
known to require more than a brief statement.
Late last year one Johnston, a Victorian
broker, murdered his wife and four children.
He then attempted suicide, but failed. Subse-
quently to his arrest it was found that he had
forged and issued a cheque for a large sum, a
crime • the discovery whereof was inevitable
within a brief period. His trial for the
murder did hot take place for months, during
which time he was under medical supervision'
in the gaol-hospital. He was thought to be in-
sane, showed various symptoms of insanity and,
on more than one occasion, seemed at the point
of death. Through care and skill he recovered
sufficiently to allow of his being placed on a
stretcher, carried to court, tried, convicted,
and condemned. The plea of temporary in-
sanity during the commission of the terrible
crime appears not to have been raised at the
trial. The date of his execution was fixed for
Monday, 11th inst. On the night of Sunday,
the 10th, two local medical men obtained
access to his cell and declared him insane.
On the following morning, ten minutes before
the hangman claimed him, came a telegram
from Melbourne granting a temporary reprieve
to allow of further medical inquiry. There-
upon a medical Board, appointed by the
Government, took the affair in hand,
and vouched for his sanity. The, last
scene in the last act of the grisly drama
took place as previously stated on Mon-
day last, when Johnston was once more
carried, to the drop this time, and duly hanged
by the neck till, after a decent interval, twelve
of his fellow-subjects certified that, whatever
doubt there might have been regarding the
state of his mind an hour before, there could be
but one opinion as to the state of his body when
cut down.
It is not easy to see why the medical board of
last week was appointed, except that the
authorities wished to make sure that they were
not about to choke a lunatic. For the real
question, after all, was not whether J ohnston was
non compos mentis on the 13th or 14th May, 1891,
but whether he was insane prior to the
commission of the crime last year. Had his
attempted suicide been successful the verdict
would almost certainly have been that his mind
was not only unhinged while taking his own
life but while taking the lives of his wife and
children. It would appear, therefore, that he
was found to be mentally sound because he
failed to kill himself. He had no object to
attain by the wholesale murder except that of
keeping a knowledge of his forgery from those
dear to him—an object entirely inadequate to
prompt any sane person to commit such
slaughter. Again, by constantly nursing a
grudge.against a person, by intently brooding
on real or fancied wrongs, a man in the full
possession of his senses might in certain cir-
cumstances be tempted to deprive of life his
own wife. But there was no evidence of such
brooding on Johnston’s part, nor, apparently,
was there cause. The testimony was all the
other way. He and his wife lived on affectionate
terms. Nor is this all. To one or more of the
three causes—fear, revenge, or profit—the
vast bulk of murders are attributable. In
Johnston’s crime all were wanting, except it
should be urged that fear, not of his wife, but
of the pain it would cause her to discover her
husband a felon, was the motive. The inade-
quacy of this motive in her case is obvious.
But, even allowing that it was sufficient to
prompt him to murder her, its insufficiency in
prompting the murder of the children is mani-
fest. The fear that induced Herod to slaughter
the Jewish children of old, or that urged
Richard to make away with his nephews, was
altogether absent in the Victorian crime. In
oixr midst are hundreds of persons, from infants
to adults, whose fathers, and occasionally,
mothers, have seen the inside of a gaol. There
is scarcely a family which, during one or two
generations, has not given the world one or
more black sheep—sometimes a parent, some-
times a child. Still, as children who take
to crime never begin by murdering their
parents, lest the latter should discover their
offspring’s wickedness, so sane parents who fall
never murder their children in order to save
them from social disgrace. The “ fear ” theory,
then, whatever application it might have to the
Ballarat convict’s wife, has none at all to his
children.
And if the “ fear ” motive is not alone in-
adequate but inapplicable so far as Johnston’s
children are concerned, the promptings of profit
or of revenge may be dismissed at once. No
profit was to be derived from their deaths. As
for revenge, no sane person could entertain
such a feeling towards an infant in arms, par-
ticularly when the child was his own flesh and
blood. Howsoever the matter is viewed, the
opinion amongst most sensible persons will be
that if Victorian doctors were psychologists
as well as physiologists, Johnston would
be to-day in a lunatic asylum instead of
in a coffin of quick-lime. But the charge
against lawyers and ordinary medical practi-
tioners that they know little or nothing of
psychology is as true to-day as when John
Stuart Mill made it forty years ago. Even
in their own special branches the evidence given
daily in courts of justice by medical “ experts ”
is enough to make a plain man apprehensive on
remembering that men’s lives and liberties are
sometimes at the mercy of such dunces. There
is no need .for particularising regarding sensa-
tionally and provenly stupid pieces of medical
evidence tendered in Australia between the
dates on which the doctors, in a murder trial,
identified the remains of a wallaby as those of a
child, and that on which a doctor, in a capital
ca,se, led the jury to accept, as a just-violated
virgin, a woman who, it was afterwards shown,
had been years on the streets.
The question now arises—and it is as well to
look it fair in the face—why did the Victorian
.Government hang Johnston ? It is our belief,
a belief for which we are prepared to give
reasons, that, had he not by his forgery com-
mitted a crime against Property, he would be
now alive. We are not prepared to say that his
being among the quick instead of the dead
would benefit the community at large, or that
it would materially benefit himself. But it
would be a signal advantage to those living
relatives of his who, in the eyes of the vulgar or
, vindictive, will bear a sort of transmitted
i social stigma from his shameful end. From a
social standpoint it is no light thing to be a near
relative -of one who has been strangled or
scourged by the common hangman. Dangling
from the same gallows or bound to the same
triangles are the social reputation of the felon’s
brothers and sisters, parents and children,
■ Thus it is impossible to give effect to the lex
talionis which holds so brutally prominent a
place in British and Australasian legislation
without enveloping innocent and guilty in one
capacious mantle of shame.
# * *
If, instead of forging signatures, Johnston
.had joined the Salvation Army, and vigorously
operated oh a big drum a short time before his
crime ; or had he, in accordance with the pre-
cepts of Christianity, given his goods to the
' poor, no hesitation would have taken place in
attributing the murder to religious lunacy. But
by Ins forgery he committed the one unpardon-
able offence in the eyes of society—an offence
against Property. Yet there exists abundant
evidence to show that remorse or the fear of
disgrace- may be as potent in turning a man’s
head as any other cause, religious or not. In:
deed, it is usually remorse that induces a person
to beat a big drum or march at the head of a
noisily-demonstrative religious procession. But
the people who insisted on sending Johnston to
his doom were mostly of the class that rises to
political power by judiciously combining re-
ligion and commerce. The plea of insanity
that they would have considered valid
had he worn a red waistcoat and
preached grotesque sermons, was disallowed
when it was discovered that he was only
a common forger. In their eyes the mental
aberration arising from remorse or fear was a
pure myth. Besides, it followed so closely on
the discreditable crime of forgery that there
would have been danger in acknowledging it.
All caiises of insanity, however, are equally
discreditable either to the lunatic or to his pro-
genitors. It is through the physiological sins
of men and women, or of their forbears, that
lunatic-asylums are filled. It is just as repre-
hensible for a person to become mentally un-
balanced through singing hymns, or fasting, as
through forgery. This, however, the propertied
political Pharisees will not allow; so that for
the psalm-singing homicide a place is found in
the lunacy-ward, while for the equally-unhinged
forger a place is found at the gallows.
Human reason and experience go to show
that motiveless murder in cold blood is a mono-
poly of the insane. This conclusion is strength-
ened—if it admits of strengthening—when
the outrage is inflicted on the lunatic’s
kin. It is additionally strengthened when the
kin consists of young children begotten of his
body. The human, but inhumane, laws which
teach the contrary and emphasise their teach-
ings by another murder are false and cannot
endure. It is easy to understand how they got
on the Statute-book in days gone by, when a rude
oligarchy ruled and the bulk of the people had
no more to do with legislation than with ruling.
But it is not so easy to understand why such
bloody enactments are permitted to remain now
that, in Australian communities at least, the
people have come in for a portion of their own.
In the case of the madman Johnston, the whole
proceedings have given a shock, not only to the
consciences of individuals, but to the moral
sense of the community. The very manner in
which he was medically patched up so as to fit
him for the gallows is suggestive of nothing so
much as of a South Sea'lsland ceremony where
the shipwrecked sailor is conscientiously
nursed and tended by the cannibals in
order to fit him for the approaching feast.
Governor Hopetoun may wash his hands of
the whole bad business as Governor Carington
did some years since when four lads were
strangled in the interests of a strumpet, or as
an historical Governor did a couple of thousand
years ago in Judea. Bub the Victorian Pro-
consul cannot rid himself of responsibility so
easily. He, in his own proper person, formed,
according to the Imperial Instructions, the
ultimate court of appeal, and he failed to
grasp the situation. Had anyone in after
years presumed to upbraid him for John-
ston’s reprieve, his reply could have
been crushing and unanswerable. The Mel-
bourne Argus might squirt its malodorous
platitudes, as on many former occasions, on the
danger of affording opportunities for further
life-taking by one who had already shed blood.
But Lord Hopetoun, if shielded by his own
conscience as he would be by the calm judg-
ment of thoughtful men, could afford to smile
at the press ghouls whose emblem of Christianity
is a cross with one arm sawn off and a noose
dangling from the other.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Flowers for the Dead.
Not long ago the Church of Rome directed a
kind of conversational sotto voce anathema
against the growing habit in Italy of placing
costly flowers on graves. This custom, a sur.
vival of the pagan abominations of Athens,
said the Holy Fathers, was a disgrace to a
Catholic community and a cruel injury to the
Church which wanted all the loose cash that the
living could spare. For instance, persons
whose souls were authoritatively known to be
wedged in Purgatory were having their tombs
decked with high-priced garlands while not a
single Mass had been arranged for. Whether
this protest has cast a damper on the funeral-
wreath nuisance in the land of Maccaroni and
Mafia, we don’t know, but if the Church has
any influence in such matters here it might be
used advantageously to itself and the public.
Flowers carried to the graves of loved
and remembered ones by the hands that
in life clasped theirs, represent a natural touch-
ing sentiment, but the waggon-loads of wire-
wove. wreaths which are hauled along the. streets
after the funeral of every prominent person,
represent nothing much beyond the brass of
enterprising florists and the want ©f moral
courage in the sons of men. No sooner has the .
Angel of Death got through with someone of
consequence, than telegrams are sent in haste '
to all sorts of likely people throughout the ■
globe, asking—“ Shall we furnish wreath for ■
So-and-So’s funeral ?” It would require a moral
firmness akin to brutality to say “ no ” to this,
so the recipient is practically blackmailed into
saying “yes,” and next morning the papers
announce the Lord —— and the Honorable
and Sir have cabled to a particularly
cute Australian florist to send wreaths to
the funeral, totally regardless of cost. The f
custom is becoming a shameless advertising
dodge. Metaphorically speaking, every dead
body likely to attract notice is now carted
through the street labelled “ Crocus and Co.,
Florists ; balls and parties supplied.” Every
distinguished citizen after death becomes a
dead-wall for advertisements of garden stuff.
The curse of Rome may not mean a great deal

The Uselessness of Old Age.
An individual, signing himself “ Old Colonist,”
writes to a Maoriland paper to raise one of the
most unanswerable questions of modern civilisa-
tion. He wants to know what use the world
has for old men, and, if the world has no use
for them, why old men exist at all ? According
to Ids own description of himself lie has toiled
patiently in three murky offices all his life, and
done a reasonable amount of good and no par-
ticular harm, and now in his declining years he
suddenly finds himself a species of conundrum
with no visible solution. He never made a pile
by stealing public lands, or by being a bear on
the Stock Exchange, or by buying anything for
less than it was worth and selling it consider-
ably above its value, or by having another man
to work for him, and paying him only half the
value of his labour, and swindling him out of the
balance. And now at the age of 60 he complains
that—although still vigorous iu mind and body
he has discovered that there is no demand for
him, and that his grey hair is an insuperable
difficulty in the way of getting employment, and
therefore he writes from his address in an in-
verted gin-case on a wharf to know what use the
world has for old men. The answer to such a
question is short and concise—for old men with-
out money the world has no use at all.
According to all the axioms of civilization
man doesn’t exist on his own account and
because he is a human being; he exists
simply because he is an animal that is
of use to an employer as a source of revenue,
and when the employer has no use for the
animal he fires it out. He doesn’t turn it out
to grass, for there is no earthly reason why he
should provide any such vegetable; he merely
turns it out without any grass whatever. For
half-grown youths aged between 14 and 18 there
is abundant employment at all times, for the
sufficient reason that they are at once cheap and
serviceable. The entire staff in an enormous
proportion of offices and shops, consists of one
adult and a boy, and if Providence had so fixed
matters that there were as many boys, aged
between 15 and 18, as adults, things might
possibly go on smoothly. When the boy, out
of the deep-rooted cussedness of his nature,
grows up, he becomes in less demand, and the
foolishness of Providence, in letting him grow
up when his employer didn’t want him to,
becomes apparent; when he is middle-aged he
is of comparatively small account; and!" when
he is a certain distance past middle age the
world has no more use for him, therefore if he
has not had the foresight to rob somebody in
his younger days his prospects amount to
nothing at all. Theoretically, no doubt, the
fact that a country contains a million inhabi-
tants is sufficient evidence that it contains em-
ployment for a million people, seeing that it is
the inhabitants who provide employment, and
unless this reasoning holds good Providence
must have miserably botched this globe
at the start, but the landlord and the
capitalist have long since altered these
primitive conditions. Therefore, for an old,
grey-headed, but still comparatively vigorous
individual, with no money, no relatives to
borrow from, and no capacity for swindling
anybody, there is practically no resource
except suicide ; for though any employer could
still make money out of him by embezzling half
the proceeds of his labour, it pays much better
Jo embezzle half the proceeds of a much younger
man. Ths capitalist exploits the whole human
race as a source of revenue, but he doesn’t
undertake in return to find employment for the
human race ; his situation is exactly that of a
man whose alleged wife is married to him,
while he is in no w r ay married to her, and con-
sequently can throw her overboard at any
moment. Therefore when a dismantled, elderly
individual writes to the papers to ask how he is
to live, the answer is all ready—the world
doesn’t expect him to live at all, and the law
and the gospel both prohibit him dying before
His time, and how he is to strike the balance
between these two facts nobody can inform him.
Lord Hopetoun has sent his kindest sym-
pathy, per secretary Wallington, to the widow
and family of an annihilated Ballarat miner.
A wicked Melbourne daily announced that ‘ ‘ on
receiving the telegram the Mayor called on Mrs.
Walters, who is in very poor circumstances,
and conveyed to her the sympathy of the
Governor.” It is to be hoped that his worship
left the telegram behind him, in which case the
bereaved woman would no doubt be able to sell
the interesting document for the price of a
square meal. This economical instance of offi-
cial fiddledeclee, however, merely proves again
the absurdity of drawing distinctions between
different classes of death for cheap advertise-
ment purposes. Most deaths seem sudden,
shocking, and inexpressibly sad to the nearest
relatives of the corpse, and women without a
£5-note in the world are losing their bread-
winners in every city, and on every day of the
year. A Governor knows no more about fatal
accidents than do other readers of newspapers,
and is no more called upon to send a mes-
sage of condolence to afflicted families in
which he takes no private interest than if he
were plain John Smith, raising his eyebrows
with surprised indifference at the long list of
mneral-notices in his morning rag. Nor is any
Governor rich enough to send a “tenner” to
every widow who wants it, and if he sent only
a telegram to each one through the Mayor, and
always paid for the telegrams, a special Vice-
Regal Sympathy Allowance Bill would soon be
rushed through the Legislature. Consequently
the Queen’s representative (like his royal
mistress) takes little official notice of corpses
which are not more or less mangled, and
prudently saves up his expressions of sorrow for
those cases on which the newspaper-reporter is
pretty busy. Even then he takes the further
precaution to engage, as his free-advertisement
agent, the local Mayor—a man who can usually
be trusted to convert such transactions into
more of those golden links or silken bonds that
Bind us,* &c., &c.
The fellow who wire-draws the Australian
Star’s cables is on the job again. The Chilian
Government troops, he says, “slaughtered the
insurgents fiendishly, and their conduct in the
hour of defiance and atrocious triumph was fero-
cious.”

Biirtley Campbell’s “ Siberia,” a work-
manlike play, abounding in dramatic situations
and couched in good language, has been revived
at Sydney Her Majesty’s. As a mere stop-gap, it is
excellently staged, and was better played, on the
opening nights, after being only five days in hand,
than m'any pieces are at this house after being in
labour as many months. The rehearsing of plays
seems somewhat akin to the training of race-
horses ; the trainer may leave a race on the
training-ground, the manager forfeit a success
through over-rehearsal. The features of the show
are the realistic manner in which the attack on
the Jewish quarter is worked-up, with the subse-
quent conflagration of property, the revolt of the
exiles and the defeat of officialism, the capture of
a two-horse sleigh and the driving off at full speed
of the fugitives. Messrs. Clint and Owen’s Mos-
cow market-place, Steppes, and Odessa harbour-
scenes are as good specimens of the scenic art as
anything seen in the house. As for the acting,
there is no performance that calls for special
praise, George Rignold looks the part and plays
more brightly as the Nihilist student than usual.
The only blemish on Harry Jewett’s Jaracoff was
a tendency to laugh when confiding his libertinism
to his creature, Sparta. This governor was a man
of the world; it is only weaklings who giggle
systematically. Edith Blande, in an auburn wig
and a colour-full costume, is a picturesque
figure and plays with considerable dash. Eor her
information it may be stated that a loaded yoke
is never lifted on to the shoulders over the head ;
the burden-carrier invariably stoops and places it
on from behind. As Count Stanislaus, Arthur
Greenaway hasn’t a very big show, but his mad
scene and suicide is distinctly good, about the
best thing he has yet given us. He should muffle
his boots, however—at present the sound of bis
footfalls is more reminiscent of a drunken man
falling upstairs than of a starving fugitive
struggling through a snow-drift. Roland Watts-
Phillips is effective as Fedora. Bessie Rignold,
Mabel Tracey, Frank Harcourt, and James Haz-
litt are all right in small parts. Young Cyril
Keightley is a very leggy lover, but shows
signs of some facility. “ Joe ” Tolano, hailed with
shrill whistlings of “ Pretty Joey ” by the gallery,
has a “ fat ” comedy part and gets a lot of laughter
for lines that are not always funny, and in some
cases are not intended to be funny. Despite a
predilection towards clowning his is a good per-
formance. By the way, Guyton Heath, in the
picturesque equipment of a courier, has a fine,
bold, horseback entrance and exit. “Siberia”
contains one weak point that could easily be re-
moved ; Stanislaus and his wife receive free
pardon from the Czar, nevertheless think it
necessary to escape with the other fugitives.
“The County Fair” will, if possible, go up on
Saturday week.

“Turned Up,” by Mark Melford, has
been a very useful piece of theatrical goods to
B. and 8., for this is its third or fourth appear-
ance at Sydney Criterion, and always to big busi-
ness. Carraway Bones, the bibulous, damp, and
cheerful, if lugubrious-looking, undertaker, is ope
of Brough's best cards, therefore bo is always
turning it up. There is nothing new about the
show that calls for special remark, except that
Arthur Lawrence succeeds George Anson and
Teddy Royce as Captain Medway. To follow
such a lead is a bit of a handicap, and the part is
scarcely in Arthur’s line ; nevertheless, his per-
formance is a good one. “Turned Up” is pro-
ceeded by “Barbara,” the well-known pathetic
littleone-actplayby Jerome K, Jerome, the author,
Sydney Daily TeIeCxRAPH would have us be-
lieve, “of those witty and trenchant essays, ‘Obiter
Dicta.’” Bosh! Jerome never wrote “Obiter
Dicta,” couldn’t write them. Augustus Birrell
was the man, unless memory be worse than fickle.
“Ted” Corlesse was to have played Finnicum,
but illness inducted Mr. Henry into his shoes.
Brenda Gibson is making rapid strides in her pro-
fession, and her Lucy Preston in “Silver Shield ”
was by far and away her best performance up to
date. Probably she will always be most accept-
able in quiet pathos, but why does she invariably
walk as if her shoes didn’t fit? By the way,
George Gordon’s Dr. Dozey in the latter play, was
a clever performance and admirably “ made-up.”
One thing about “Turned Up” is more than a
little wearisome, that is, the persistent way in
which the words black, dark and shadow, &c., are
dragged in and emphasised simply because a
nigger and her “cullud kid” happen along.
“ JanC,” in which Pattie Browne will re-appear,
the farcical comedy which has popularised the
word “tart” as applied to femininity in polite Lon-
don circles, goes up on Saturday next.

The stage mirth accompanying the merry
chiming of “ The Bells of Haslemere ” at Sydney
Royal in the last act was somewhat damped on the
evening of Wednesday, 13th, by the accident that
happened to Albert Norman when his career of
villainy was ended by his being thrown from the
bridge into the mill-stream. In falling he struck
an iron spike, and received an ugly gash in the
groin, which nearly severed an artery and neces-
sitated Dr. M‘Donagh’s insertion of thirteen
stitches. At the time of writing the actor
is said to be progressing favourably. His
part was taken on the following evening
by stage-manager Frank Emery, who was
not only letter perfect, but almost au fait as
regards “ business,” a wonderful effort of memory
inside twenty otherwise busy hours. The country
dance of the first act, well-drilled and full of
colour, is good to look upon, and the rapid changes
involved by the six scenes of the third act, done
in full view without a. hitch, are admirable illus-
trations of the resources of modern stage-craft.
The opera company open here in “ The Gondo-
liers ” on May 30, or June 2 ; in either case “ The
Bells ” will hold the fort till they arrive.

Business at Sydney Garrick has been fair
to middling, and it seems likely that with a
stronger cast in two or three instances, i i• t Liz.
would have boomed round “Masks and .V0.,-..”
The jig-dancing of the fair Janet is creditably
correct in Style and picturesque, and further in-
spection inclines us to repeat our encomiums con
cerning George Leitch’s very clever portrait of the
old-time beau, Colley Cibber, with his snuff-box,
his shaky limbs and querulousness. “ Forget-Me-
Not ” goes up on Saturday night. By the way,
Sydney D.T. said that “ Mr. Charrington’s triplets
is happily conceived.” The statement is at once
ungrammatical and erroneous.

Proprietor Wyburd of Bondi has already
commenced to improve that breezy resort. For
instance, he has run a wide staircase down from
the balcony towards the switchback, and intends
to_ ornament the intervening space with foun-
tains and flower-beds. He also intends to erect
a monkey-house in some snug corner. The Faust
family and 18 other performers are engaged for
Her Gill’s Birthday.

At Coogee Aquarium quadrille assemblies
are held every Wednesday evening, and the hall
is open for skating on Thursday nights and
Saturday afternoons. Novelties are promised for
Queen’s Birthday. By the way, at a “sacred and
classical ” lately, someone sang “Martha whacked
the Donkey.” Sacred item only because the
donkey is a Biblical quadruped.

Owing to lack of bold advertisement,
Madame Patey’s first farewell concert in Sydney
Town Hall was sparsely attended, but the attend-
ance at the succeeding two made amends. Indeed,
at the last concert the ground-floor occupants were
frothed up into the galleries and on to the plat-
form. The great contralto sailed for Maoriland
on Tuesday, where the popular Lohr has be<n
preparing her ways, bearing with her the Philar-
monic Society’s badge, a harp of gold. By the
way, Tenor Jones, whom Madame takes along
with her, was previously afforded a chance by
Amy Sherwin. He has a nice voice, but doesn’t
know how to let it go, and it is sometimes so small
that he can’t be heard without an opera-glass.

“ The Scout,” a wild, aquatic hippodrome
in four acts, ten yells, three plunges and a
piercing shriek, was duly produced at Melbourne
Alexandra on Saturday week. Dramatic criti-
cism bows its head and gasps for breath before
this piece of riotous realism, which runs rings
round all previous records in sensation drama, and
supplies a jaded world with half-a-dozen new
pages of stage-history right off the reel. The
literary structure of “The Scout,” run-up at the
shortest notice, is a crude specimen of jerry
building, and the stage-management requires
time to mature. Nevertheless, it should be an
easy matter for Dampier and Garnet Walch, with
such a mass of original material at their disposal,
so to strengthen the weak places in the
show that it may support Dr. Carver and his
Wild West organisation in a tour round the
universe. To attain this end it will first be neces-
sary to adopt violent measures with Walch’s
notions of “ comic relief. ” The funny characters
have nothing to do with the plot, yet they are
allowed to pop up at intervals throughout the
evening and throw a wet blanket over the
nervous excitement. This is monstrous. There
is one obviously proper course open to these
humorous characters. After a brief display of
badinage and sparkling wit they must fall into
the hands of the Indians, and get themselves
slowly tortured to death, so that an appreciative
audience, gloating over their last agonies, may
feel that justice has been done. The story of
“The Scout” is simple, but dislocated. Two
villains—one quite white and the other a piebald
monster of mixed extraction—are continually
inciting the Injuns to carry off Lily Dampier from
her father’s home in the backwoods, whilst Frank
Carver, sometimes alone and sometimes attended
by Mexicans and cowboys, is generally rushing to
the rescue on horseback. Lily is a good deal on
horseback herself, and what with the real Indians,
fiery steeds, and a genuine tank river at the back
of the stage, matters are made sufficiently
astounding by the time that the last of
the tribe gets wiped out. The river, which
must be at least ten feet deep in the mid-
dle, is a splendid property, skilfully managed.
One curtain falls upon Carver’s hurling of the pie-
bald villain into this stream from the precipice
above, after which an Indian leaps from the other
side of the rocky heights and saves the other
fellow from a watery grave. The astonishment of
sundry swans when these strange bodies come
“ ker-plunk ” in their midst is a drama in itself.
The second act terminates with a stupendous
thrill. Lily and her Frank, escaping from Injins
as usual, ride their horses over a bridge. After
the maiden has got safely across, the concern gives
way in the middle. Carver’s horse drops clean
down in the tanky torrent and swims away to the
wings, and the indomitable Scout is left hanging
to the broken bridge. Again, the closing scene
shows Indians taking breast strokes along the
river with knives in their mouths, and cowboys
swimming their horses in pursuit. Dampier
claims for this series of sensations that they have
never before been attempted on any stage. He
might go further and say that the horse-
falling incident had never been dreamt
of by any theatrical manager on earth.
The drama is further enlivened by Carver’s
shooting _ exhibition, with which he amuses
the Indians (after they have enjoyed a
war-dance) in consideration of their promise to
spare Lily’s life. Amongst other feats he fires
over his shoulder, and, taking aim from a mirror
held in his right hand, smashes a glass ball fixed
against a target in the rear. As an actor, Carver,
who made his debdt on Saturday, ought to be
feeling his feet by now. He is already a finished
performer on a horse. The Injuns seem to have
heaps of dramatic instinct waiting to be cultivated
by practice, and Lily Dampier, Robert Vernon,
Appleton and others unravel the tangled yarn
with considerable vigour, the two male miscreants
acting very conscientiously all the time. There
is no end to the possibilities of “ The Scout ”
when Carver and his Wild America people have
acquired confidence and experience, and the
literary framework has received more attention.
Meanwhile, it is a show that sets ridicule at
defiance and rides rough-shod over the scoffer.
** * »
The big house was crowded last Saturday,
and the phenomenal tank effects—which Dr.
Carver has patented in all directions—were re-
ceived in the “circle ” with a dumb astonishment
which speaks more eloquently than the whistles
of the sardined democracy up above. Carver has
not yet learned to talk with loud determination,
nor to hurl himself about as a hero, especially a
genuine hero, is expected to do. But he hurls the
others pretty considerably; also he drops his
gallant steed through the bridge like a man born
to be equal to emergencies. The Doctor’s horse
is a game bit of stuff—although it certainly gets
rather restless when bath-time comes—whereas
one of the cowboys’ nags declines to pursue the
Indians, and has a way of calmly settling down
in some 10ft. of water, leaving the rider to vacate
his saddle and swim for himself. The force of
realism cannot further go than this.
“Bridget O’Brien, Esq.,” shook her false
front to an overflowing audience at Melbourne
Royal on Saturday. It was an intensely Young
Australian audience, mainly composed of very
young men. The average ago of the Royal con-
gregation would be a good ten years less than
that of the crowd over at the Bijou, and thereby
hangs a tale—a sad, solemn, o’ertrue tale. There
was scarcely a convincing ring about the youthful
laughter that discriminated between Sheridan’s
brightest and dullest sallies in favour of the latter.
It was too evident to everybody that “Bridget”
is the “ Widow ” over again, wooed by the. same
adventurer in a fresh disguise, and possessed of
the same short-frocked daughter, whose mash is
twin-brother to his predecessor. Likewise, there'
is no denying the awful resemblance between that
variety-show aboard the Bristol and the “ Grand
Masquerade ’’which now brings matters to a con-
clusion. “Bridget O’Brien,” in short, is a
reminiscence of so recent a past that Satur-
day’s bursts of merriment sounded at times
like echoes heard in the caverns of memory.
“ If you liked the pickles, try the sauce,” ran the
once familiar advertisement of a condiment manu-
facturer. “ Bridget ” sauces everybody in much
the same way as the Widow gave them pickles,
and J. F. Sheridan stands where he did. The man
never once shows through his quaint, lovable,
inimitable impersonation, his capacity for making
the poorest repartee appear rich in humour is as
deep and broad as ever. Alfred James earns a
few laughs under difficulties, Gracie Whiteford
acts better but sings worse than before, and Miss
Maude Leamington's amateurish performance of
the rival mother-in-law gives promise of better
things hereafter. Her contralto singing is more
than satisfactory, too, whilst the fact that she
should come on and sing at all, under the circum-
stances, is not more hopelessly idiotic than the
metamorphosis of the Widow, and everybody else,
into music-hall performers. “Bridget O’Brien,
Esq.,” is naturally a more extensiveand expensive
affair than it was at Sydney Garrick. The
“ Masquerade ” scene, by Brunton, is sufficiently
beautiful for a first-class pantomime.
* * ft *
“ Comrades,” revived at the Bijou, is too
hollow in its leading motive and artificial in ctr
tain situations to excite much genuine interest.
Even the B. and B. Company fail to give an air
of probability to what are intended for serious
scenes, and the tearful parting between Tithe radge
and Miss Emma Temple was greeted with a
casual guffaw on Saturday. The lady quite failed
to hold the house, and Tith. seemed unable to
help her. In poetic love-making the same pair
scored freely, however. Harry St. Maur, as a
white-wigged nobleman in charge of the hollow
motive, is weak and colourless, and Anson (also
back in his old part) is handicapped with an
absurd yarn about somebody who lived in France,
and otherwise hampered with a poodle. For the
rest, some opportunities for strong acting are well
gripped. Miss Enson touches the heart gently,
and when 'Boucioault, as the old soldier-servant,
would fain shoot himself through the lungs and
liver, he brings down the curtain amidst a roar of
applause. For Saturday (23rd), “ The Idler ” was
still advertised at time of writing. Charles
Cartwright lay ill at Adelaide, however, and it is
very probable that Haddon Chambers’ play will
have to be held over for another week.

Last nights of “ The Old Guard,” at Mel-
bourne Princess’, are in immense request, and
“ Evangeline ” draws fair audiences to the Opera
House. Gourlay and Snazelle have inserted some
new business, and the American strangers seem
toned down by a dark suspicion that they are not
particularly funny outside of their own country.
A suggestion concerning Catherine and the heifer
was intended for last issue, but circumstances pre-
vented its publication. The management should
introduce a tank and a bridge into one of the
scenes—say, Evangeline’s kitchen. Then the
heifer might carry bonnie Fortescue to the middle
of the bridge, and while its fair charge dropped
through into the tank below, the htifer could
remain suspended to the ruins by its tail. That
ivould be an American novelty.

Rev. Charles Clarke is farewellmg to
big business at the Athenasum, the Halls continue
to come up smiling, and the Battle of Waterloo
Cyclorama celebrated its second anniversary on
Monday. Old Jeremiah is still on the premises,
and Mr. Forster, having delivered two thousand
lectures on the subject, is fully persuaded that he
saw Wellington thrash Bonaparte with his (F.’s)
own naked eye.

A fine full benefit programme will be
put through at the Royal on Saturday afternoon,
in aid of the mariners who managed to escape
from the recent wrecks without owing much to
the lifeboat. The show is certain to be as good
as the cause, and seats may be booked at Allan’s.

The Misses Albu had £2O in 'Melbourne
Town Hall for their first concert and £9 for the
second. Yet by a wholesale distribution of
“stiffs” they could at anytime fill the.edifice
with a fashionable, “ music-loving ” audience who
would encore every item and advise all their
friends to get orders for such a delightful enter-
tainment rather than miss hearing these dear
girls. It was absured for the Albus to sing to
empty benches when sassiety is ever willing to
doll itself up and swoop in on the enthusiastic
“ nevah.”

Sims Reeves’ last farewell to the patient
English public doesn’t relieve us of the fear that
ho may yet come to Australia, because the
veteran’s voice can’t be more non-existent now
than it was 15 years ago. Hundreds of times
since 76, when the thin end of his sole remaining
top-note melted into space, has Sims Reeves
received boisterous encores for ballads that were
quite inaudible to people sitting close under the
platform. Yet his celebrity as a robust tenor “ in
his day ” will live for another century, and
deservedly. It was entirely owing to the man’s
strength of mind, and fearless contempt for
ignorant clamourers, that he was able to make
his day a long one. He never forgot that the
people, who jeered at him for declining to sing
when his bronchial tubes had gone suddenly
wrong, would have been the first to jeer at his
voice if he had consented to overtax it. By never
singing in his heyday unless he could amaze his
audience, he established such a name for his sing-
ing, and such an interest in his personality, that
the face of Sims Reeves became a good stock-in-
trade even when he had no voice left to sell.

The difference bet,ween English and Aus-

Consumption and the
“Microbe Killer.”
Radam’s Microbe Killer Co. Gentlemen,—l
think it only right to let you know I am getting
on with your great remedy, the Microbe Killer,
and the great benefit that 1 have received from its
use. Having suffered for some time past from
bad hemorrhage, night sweats, and pneumonia,
the doctors said my lungs were in a very bad
state. I got very much alarmed as I lost a large
quantity of blood, and, like a drowning man
catching at a straw, I tried many remedies, but
with little success. A friend of mine knowing
how ill I had been, advised me to try the Microbe
Killer. I did so, and I am thankful to God, that
I did. After taking the Microbe Killer for about
a fortnight it made me feel very sick, but after-
wards I began to improve. I have now taken
four jars of the Microbe Killer—two of No. 1, and
two of No. 2—with the result that my appetite has
improved, the night sweats have stopped and I
have had no more hemorrhage, and my|health
has greatly improved, and I hope by God’s bles-
sing through the use of your great remedy, that I
shall soon be restored to my usual health and
strength again. I hope that I shall still have
better news to tell you later on. Gentlemen, I
write these few lines for the benefit of the suffer-
ing, believing that if they will give it a fair trial
it will restore them to health. Yours respectfully,

in Australia, and the silence is especially perfect

When Nellie Stewart makes her London
(Übut , the independent critics (who are extremely
limited in number) will probably agree in locating
the faults with which they qualify their praise.
They will notice that her singing, whilst always
pure and clever, is often inclined to be hard and
unsympathetic, that her manner is self-conscious,
her gestures none too natural, and her air of
abandon distinctly forced. Doubtless, too, there
will be remarks passed upon her “bobbing ” bow,

trick of travelling—every now and then-sideways

that Nellie’s coldest admirers will vote her a
charming girl, and admit that, taking her for all
in all, they seldom see her like upon the English
stage.

Snazelle, the actor, was out the other day
in Melbourne, when somebody drove over him or
something of the sort, and nearly reduced him to
an unpleasant dead body on the pavement.
Accounts are confused about this incident, but by
judiciously assorting the statements it would
appear that Snazelle and his son, or else his
father, were riding together, or else the person
who was riding with Snazelle was his aunt, while
other narratives assert that he was on foot; and
it is also reported that he wasn’t there at all, and
in addition it is maintained in some quarters that
there isn’t any such individual. Anyhow, while
he was either riding or walking, or staying away
along with the person hereinbefore mentioned, if
there was a person, a vehicle, that ranged all the
way from a barrow right up to a train and a wild
beast caravan, shot round the adjacent corner,
and either galloped over Snazelle or his companion,
if either were there, or else grazed him, or did
some other damage, or else Snazelle fell over a
banana-skin, while other accounts say that he had
a fit in a public-house ; and another authority
asserts that he fell out of bed and barked his nose.
At all events he is reported to have started in
pursuit of the vehicle that ran over him or the
other person, or the vehicle started after him,
provided there was a vehicle, or else they both
started after each other, and after an appalling
race Snazelle overtook his enemy or else was over-
taken himself. Other accounts state , that they
both inadvertently ran in a circle, and that Snazelle
made such appalling speed in his efforts to get
away from the man behind him that he got a
whole lap ahead, and ran down and trod on the
slower individual in front, and broke his back. At
all events they came together in course of time,
and Snazelle walloped his enemy within an inch
of his life, or else got up a tree and screamed for
the police. There are so many conflicting reports
that it is difficult to say which he did ; but one or
both of the parties either hit his enemy, or else
ran away, or something. We mention these facts
to give a lift to a brilliant and well-meaning
artist, knowing the hunger of the “profession”
for free “ads.” Later advices inform us that
Snazelle really fell out of an omnibus, but this is
a mere detail.

The Carfcwright-Nethersole season at the
Adelaide Royal, has ended profitably, “ The
Idler ” proved their most remunerative article, and
it was revived for the two last nights. Unfor-
tunately, Charles Cartwright has been stricken
down with a serious illness, which will probably
incapacitate him for some time. Lawrence
Cautley took his part for three nights in “ The
Middleman” with “text” in hand, and gave a
most meritorious reading. Sass, at short notice,
played Mark Cross in the revival of “ The Idler,”
with ease and credit, while Mr. Cosgrove under-
took Sir John Harding. The Darrells, assisted
by Cautley, Russell, Palmer, Walton, Stewart,
Constance Deorwyn and others, are now en-
deavouring to cultivate “The English Rose.”
Jack Smith and Sophie Harris are in Adelaide,

In Arthur Sullivan’s “ Ivanhoe ” the fair Lady Rowena

Charles Sugden is another well-known London actor
who has lately filed his schedule, with liabilities amount-
ing to a comfortable figure and assets totting up to
exactly nil. Charles is a rather swellish individual chiefly
remarkable for having cuckolded (Shakespearean term)
the Earl of Dysart previous to marrying the fair divorcee.
Santley has been telling his Glasgow friends how, when

Charles Warner was cast for a ludicrous part in the
farewell benefit to old manager Morton, at the Alhambra,
Chawley read the address composed by Clement Scott, and
had to wind up by grabbing a long sword and crying,
“Charles Morton ! kneel! I knight you ! Rise you can,
Father of Music-Halls, and Grand Old Man ! ” It took
the Progenitor of ’Alls, who is a chicken of 73, a few
minutes to get down on his brittle marrowbones, and
'Varner was looking emotional all the time.
Mrs. R. A. Proctor lectured on “The Moon,” at the
1 olytechnic Institution, London, on 10th April; and
during the following week she was to give three lectures

audience included R. S. Smythe, who managed Proctor’s
Australian tour, and worked up a big excitement about
1 arkes’s celebrated prohibition.

A London paper rolls its tongue lovingly round the
information that “Lord Feversham is the proud father of
four of the most beautiful young women in England, ‘ one
being a duchess, and the other three ladies.’ ” We don’t
know them, but we do know his daughter-in-law, Nellie
Leamar, of the London music-halls. She’s a regular
beauty of a young woman. In company with her partner
(stage “sister”) she was wont to warble “We’ve just
Escaped from the Harem.” They pronounced it “ Hair-
’em.”
A movement is on foot at Perth, W.A., for the erection
of a theatre in that city. At present' theatrical perform-

when filled at top prices, will not hold more than £4O,
and besides, is a model of inconvenience.
The Hudson Surprise Party, having arrived from India

Previous to the publication of “Oarpio” little John
Finnamore wrote a tragedy, “Francesca Vasari.” It was
enacted at the old Melbourne Royal by amateurs (male),

On the first trip of the Edouin family to China and
India both Rose and Julia got married, the former to G.

Laura Villiers comes out, engaged by Amory Sullivan, as
leading lady for Melbourne Royal—best known by her
depiction of Fedora, a la Bernhardt, throughout England.
Barry Sullivan leaves an autobiog., like the rest o

Paris Figaro has an elaborate and most instructive
article on the death of Madame Lawrence Barrett, the
great American actress, whose husband is a retired
General of distinction, from the American Civil War.
Madame Lawrence Barrett was extremely beautiful, most
talented, and her costumes the envy of the fashionable
world.
George Fortescue, the Evangeline man woman, is a
queer-looking fellow off the stage, big, burly, farmer-like,
bucolic, with his eye-glasses on—an elderly man who
looks like a Chief Justice as he accompanies his daughter
round the Melbourne sights. He is the most unlikely
man to pitch on in all the city for an actor, and, above
all, who could possibly fasten on such a John-Bryanic
personage for a female personator—a cross between
Glasscott Symes and the departed Judge Fellows ?
Says the Hawk ; The Star , having made a fool o f

When a couple of distinguished singers were starting to
come down from the North to Sydney the other day hubby
attempted to induce a passing guard to lock the carriage-

Ella Bankhardt (daughter of a Sydney Techno-
logical Museum official) and lately the London
Gaiety’s premiere danseuse, does not come to Aus-

Frank Emery revels in detail. Drilling the millers in
“ Bells of Haslemere,” at Sydney Royal, he spotted one
super, carrying his sack by one hand, across his back
from shoulder to hip. Frank stopped him and said, in his
quiet way; “Now, laddie, your own common sense ought
to tell you that a sack of flour is a heavy thing and could
not be carried except as your mates do, with both hands.”
“ All right, Mr. Emery,” said the super. “I’ve been a
miller these twenty years, butit’s never too late to learn.”

goes to travel on a fortune. Charles Dornton, one of the

It was after the Philharmonic concert. The lady—you
know the übiquitous female who hangs on like a limpet to
the skirts of everyone worth knowing—remarked to the
maestro: “What a delightful concert, Signor Basson!
The organ was very fine, don’t you think?” To which he
replied: “ I tink so, yes ;ze organ was ze salvation of ze
consayert, yes!” Whereupon the lady, recognising the
irony, said, deprecatingly—“ Oh, I don’t know that.”
The reply was incisive—“ No; then you do not your
Sydney Mornebng Hberald read—what!”
Charles Clark is as good as ever, but Australia has

Mrs. Keeley, as a young woman, acted a street-boy, in a
drama named “Genevieve.” She was fetched before the
beaks like poor Jo, and the question was put to her,
“Where are your accomplices?” to which she replied,
“ I don’t wear any ; they holds up without.” The gallery
never afterwards troubled her to make this reply.
The most appalling occurrence ever known in a theatre
was at the Opera House, Portland, Oregon, a few weeks
ago. A rich gambler, named Elliott, was refused by Miss
Durand, one of the chorus. He fired all the charges of a
revolver from the boxes into the ladies’ chorus on the
stage, killing two, but Miss Durand escaped unhurt. ■»
Returning to England from Australia, Barry Sullivan
found the traditional played out, wherefore he could no
more make a London footing than Brooke. However, the
provinces folded him to their arms, though Fechter had
slain him metropolitanly. He overcame great natural
difficulties.
Barry Sullivan’s management of the Melbourne Royal
was the most brilliant thing in its annals. Opened with
“ School for Scandal,” and went the whole round of the
legitimate for over two years. At one time the stock
included Heir, 0. Vincent, Fitzgerald, Lambert, C. Young,
R. Stewart, Harwood, Miss Cleveland and Mrs. Heir.
Rev. Mark Guy Pearse is said to have received a letter
the other day from a N.Q. theatrical agent—or, rather,

“character songs and clog-dancing;” further, enquiring
whether he can play the violin, guitar, or bones. A lie,
probably.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
What’s in a “name?” A great deal. Some
time back the committee of the leading Melbourne
Athletic Club (“for gentlemen only”) refused to give
a certain pugilist a show at their noble hall on the
grounds that he had no science—and mere brute strength
was not wanted among gentlemen. Well, now the same
potentates are trying to raise a cool thousand for the
boor to knock the stuffing out of the big Yankee, Joe
M'Auliffe. The only difference in the pug. is that he (Joe
Goddard) is now champion of Australia, and could do a
lot towards piling up the chib's now slender bank-
account.

“ What price the great Carbine when at the

The wiseacres said the same of the once mighty Barb, the
then demon of the turf—yet what a rank failure his
best was—for Tocal was a mere plater ; that unbeaten
wonder, Grand Flaneur, is not much better ; his only two,
Bravo and Penance, have cost Mr. Jones a fortune. A
dozen other erstwhile stars are now doing stud-duty on
back-block stations.

At one of the Melbourne clubs a scientific
slugging match was on the boards, and as the two
cropped-headed lads stepped into the ring, a strange
potentate, evidently much alcoholised, called out that
he would back either of the lads, “just for sport.” The
honey-pot was at once rushed, and a lot of money went
up in no time. But, to the great surprise of all, the
worst lad warn (as the papers put it, “ by a fluke”), and
a little time afterwards the strange gentleman was to be
seen (quite sober) enjoying some apparently excellent
joke with a hook-nosed bookmaker. Four people are now T
barred at that hall.

It is perhaps not known that the representative
of a certain Sydney sporting paper is not now allowed

So much for fair reporting on a “slaughter” got up by “real
sportsmen.”

Some few years back one of our best horsemen
and horse-owners was making a name for himself on fhe
turf, but the pace was too fast, and he was left in the
ruck without money and without horses. But, as he
said, he had his health and strength left, and a billet was
found for him as manager of a back station— supposed to
belong to a large firm in town. His managership will
long be remembered: every man on the station was in
his particular line a sport, and nothing pleased the boss
better than to go down to the big hut at night and talk
sport, past and present, with the hands. Some months
ago news was received that the boss’s uncle was dead, and
had left him the station of which he was manager.

Apropos to the sanguinary slugging in a Sydney
boxing-hall lately exposed in the press, it may be remem-
bered that a Sydney gymnastic club, some time ago,
seriously considered the advisability of excluding re-
porters, believing that its existence was endangered by
the lurid colouring of their descriptions.

To ask honestly for payment for honest services
in the football field is, in the eyes of some clubs, a crime.
A certain crack junior, on joining the ranks of the Carlton
F.8.C., is said to have openly demanded payment. Of
course he was very young and innocent to do so. As he
had not played in a single big match, he was refused.
Then he struck his colours, went over to the St. Hilda,
and helped to win the match, playing the game of the
forty. This was too much for the Dark Blues to stand,
so an individual, who derives his nickname from his
savage play in the old Hothara days, was put up as the
champion of “ Honest Football ” to impeach the youngster
and the whole affair will be brought before the V.F.B.A.
Now. that the accuser is up he might ask— “ How do half
the footballers live throughout the year ?” Answer: “ On
the ball.”

“ Professor ” Miller is in training to appear at
the Melbourne Alexandra in Shakespearean plays. He is
at present working off some of his fat, and with proper
support is bound to draw. He may be expected to
appear on the horizon simultaneously with the advent of
John L. Sullivan at the Opera House. Should Joe God-
dard and Mick Dooley think of following suit, perhaps
the Royal will open its doors and make a boom of the
noble art.
* * *
Big capital is being made by the unco guid anent
the unscienced and untrained man who was hurt at Sam
Matthews’-hall. Supporters of the “noble art” should
prepare a list of serious accidents met with in a season’s
football matches and horse-races over the sticks. These,
in comparison, would make “the ring” appear about the
most harmless sport under the sun.
* * #
The racecourse rogues of N. S. W. are mere
weaklings alongside their southern brethren. On Sydney
side a horse-owner can on the average reckon on getting
a pretty square deal from the racecourse committees, but
on many of the southern tracks the professional officials
are mostly chevaliers d’industrk. One sure way of
winning is this: Back your horse and confidently tell the
individual members of the committee such lies about the
prad’s prowess as to induce them to follow suit. Then
you hold all the cards. First one gentleman will palm you
a ticket giving you the inside running, then the starter
will see that you get away first, and to the judge, if he
can sight you at all at the finish, it doesn’t matter a rap if
you are licked home by a length, he will send your
number up. But if you are donkey - licked, protest
against everything in front of you, and you will land the
stakes. So notorious are these tactics that on several
courses within 80 miles of Melbourne, the racing habitue
devotes much time to discovering what the committee
are hacking.

the start. The English record is by Perkins at Lillie Bridge
in 2hrs. 39min. 57sec. The hall will be opened for skating

The “sending up ” for 12 months of Leichhardt,
owner, and jockey, at Canterbury Park, on Saturday,
savours much of a joke to everyone—except the owner
and jockey. The greatest crime of Leichhardt’s owner
appears to be that he sent his horse out in shoes, but in
face of the running of shod horses by prominent owners
so reoentty, under the very noses of the A.J.C. Com-
mittee, that action alone should not have called down
Saturday’s serious sentence. That the horse was not in a
fit state to run there could not be a doubt, as he finished
all abroad in a lather of sweat, and allowing that the
sentence on the owner be a just one, it would be interest-
ing to know on what lines the Canterbury people
disqualified the jockey, young Parker, hitherto with a
clean sheet. Is a jockey to refuse a mount if the owner
thinks fit to start his horse with shoes ; or if he finds his
mount is‘‘dead to the world” after running a couple of
furlongs, is he to flog the hide off him without a show of
winning, or run the chance of a disqualification? And
now comes the gist of this par. The Australian Jockey
Club is supposed to ratify these disqualifications. Before
so doing in the present case, the Australian Jockey
Club ought certainly to make personal investiga-
tion into the riding of Leichhardt ere taking
the bread and butter from a youngster on the
recommendation of a proprietary club in which at least
one large owner and trainer is reported to have a big in-
terest. This brings up a question already brought
under notice in these columns, and again the writer
gives it as his opinion that the sport of horse-racing would
be purified to no small extent if the A.J.C. and V.R.C.
passed a rule prohibiting any trainer or jockey from
holding an interest in any proprielary racing club.

No. VI.—Mr. Pounce’s Obnoxious Client.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When Mr. James Giddings-Benson (per
Surry, 10 years), assigned man (shepherd) to Major-
General William Stewart,, of “ Ihe Mount,
Bathurst, wrote the letter which follows to Mr.
Timothy* Pounce, Writer—and Forger-Upper
Macquarie-street, Sydney, he knew perfectly well
that he would receive by return-mail the pass
referred to. This was his letter ;
Mr. Pounce, —You are an arrant old swindler, that’
what you are ! You have got my coin, and unless I ge
that pass within a fortnight I’ll just blow the whole gaff*
I can square it with the General, and it will stop your
game, my hearty, so if I don’t get that pass within the
time, there will be the devil to pay. I’m not a slummy
(muff) old codger—you can’t bamboozle me, so none of
your roguery. You know what the poet says. I d give
you the Latin,*old buck, but I know 3 r ° ll are T ■
ignorant to understand it —“Laws grind the poor, and
great men vale the law.” These cursed colonial laws

James Giddings-Benson had been assigned
as a wharf-clerk in Sydney on his arrival at Port
Jackson. He was a “special’’convict, of superior
education, and considerable plausibility of manner,
and might have done remarkably well —might,
indeed, have become a magnate in the commercial
and banking world, and, in mature years, possibly
a member of council, but for an unfortunate weak-
ness. He would get drunk. _
The habit was characteristic enough of Old
Sydney society, but tliej’e were two ways of look-
ing at'it. When the drunkard was included in,
the official or “respectable ” classes, then the tin
was not only not a sin, but was a positive virtue.
It only became sinful and vicious when the in-
toxicated individual belonged to the convict or
lower “ ’Mancipist ” class. And as Benson was
numbered among the second, and as he would not
or could not prevent himself sampbng Hooghly
rum lavishly, Messrs. Richard Jones •& Co. were
reluctantly compelled to return him to the service
of Government. Which was a proceeding not
more displeasing to Mr. Benson himself than to
his esteemed friend, Timothy Pounce.
Mr. Bounce was a man who never lost an
opportunity of adding to his knowledge or of
increasing his professional capacity ; and in the
pursuance of his ambition to become first among
his peers—that is to say, to hold the position of
pre-eminent forger of Old Sydney—ho made the
acquaintance of and sought to utilise all sorts and
conditions of men. Consequently, when Fate
threw Mr. Giddings-Benson in his way, ho felt
very grateful to Fate. - For, as wharf-clerk to the
great shipping and merchant firm, pretty nearly;
every signature of forgeable value within the
colony would come into Mr. Benson’s hands
attached to a bill-of-lading, a bond-warrant, or a
carrier’s order. Into his hands, wc say, and,
therefore, time and opportunity being favourable,
under his tracing-paper. Rather a pretty penman
was Benson ; not an expert like Mr. Bounce, but
still a neat hand at copying ; and after one or two
preliminary tests of the wharf-clerk's proficiency,
Mr. Pounce felt quite at ease in laying by for use
When business commissions came in, Mr. Benson’s
artistic tracings. Next to having an autograph
before him when it became necessary to prepare a
“pardon” or a “pass,” nothing could be better
than Mr. Benson’s careful copies. So Pounce
thought; and so thinking, he paid Benson not
illiberally.
Perhaps it would have been as well if he had
remunerated the wharf-clerk on a less generous
scale. Messrs. Richard Jones and Co. were
devoted adherents to Law and Order, and were
accordingly not inclined to extend to their useful
“ special’’-assigned hand many emoluments be-
yond those allowed by Regulation. If the System
considered that an annual allowance of two suits
of clothing at Bs. 9d. per summer suit, and 12s. 9d.
per winter suit, one hat at Is; 3d., two pairs of
boots at 7s. lid. per pair, two check shirts at
2s. 3d., one neckerchief at 7d., were, in addition
to a weekly ration of flour, meat (at the rate of 6s:
for 12 men's rations per iveek), salt and soap f
ample remuneration for Mr. Benson’s services as
rendered to the firm, the firm was not going to set
the System at defiance by largely supplementing
the allowance that a just law and a generous
Government secured to their convict-servant.
Not a bit of it. They gave Mr. Benson 2s. per
week.
Thus, the guinea or two weekly which fell into
his way from Mr. Pounce, in exchange for trac-
ings of commercially or magisterially valuable
signatures, were greatly appreciated by Benson—
so much so that the nights of payment he was, by
the time the patrol-,watch called round at his
favourite house Of refreshment —the Duck and
Whistle on the Brickfield Hill—to clear out the
bar, generally in a condition to be removed to the
police-office cells. We do not assert he was so
removed. Mr. Jones, or Mrs. Riley’s representa-
tive (we think hs name was Mr. Brogan), would
have objected to the useful hand being incarcerated
for seven days, and the patrol had too much
respect for the great firm to lock up an assigned
man unless the firm wished it. And while the
firm had not the least objection to Benson or any
other assigned hand being imprisoned in the
“off” or dull season (would, on the contrary,
have been rather biased than otherwise, for then
the Government wo c dd have to keep the culprit),
still, the patrol could not tell with oertainty
when the firm was busy or not. And so
they almost invariably gave the clerk the benefit
of the doubt. In the interests of sobriety, they
would relieve him of any unexpended portion of
RIGHT INTO HIS HAND.
MORMON PREAOTHER (in the Domain): “And Sarah persuaded Abraham to take unto himself

ento hees hand.”
Pounce’s dollars (five Spanish dollars went to the,
guinea sterling) and then let him sleep his sleep
out on the sanded floor. This was the regular
routine, week in and week out; and, perhaps, all
things considered, it was by no means an inequit-
able arrangement. Pounce got the models for his
forgeries; Benson got sufficiently drunk; the
police and the Duck and Whistle’s landlord shared
the fruits of Benson’s obligingness; and Messrs.
Richard Jones and Co. did not lose the services of
their tally-clerk. There were lots of things done
in Old Sydney which weren’t half so satisfactory
to all parties as this.
But as all things must have an end, there came
an end .fo the patrolmen’s tolcrarjce. For one
night, whether it was that the atmosphere was
sharper and prevented him sleeping, or the rum,
not so strong, or something else which history
deponeth not, the naughty Benson grew quarrel-
some and satirical. He jeered at the patrol when’
they bounced in at 10 o’clock, and, altogether
unmindful of their past kindnesses to him styled
them simply so many land-sharks.
“TenJcl’k, and all’s hie well, ish it?
’Tishn’t! ” ■ ;
“ Hush, Benson ! ” remonstrated the landlord,
anxious that none of his clients should cause a
breach in the good understanding between himself
and the patrol. “ Hush, yer’ll.git in fur it.”
What did he care if he did ? With hiccoughs of
more or less intensity, he warned the landlord’ to
shut up, and told the patrol to descend to limbo,'
and blessed the firm, and cursed Old Pounce.
And so there was no alternative but to let him in
“for it.”
» * »
He was very penitent next morning before
the “Bond” side of the Police-court. “First
offence, y’r Worships, please. Won’t offend again.
I am nearly due for ticket, y’r and a
sentence, gentlemen, will put me back.” Thus he
appealed, but in vain. The Rhadamanthine
justices, having learnt just in a casual way that
the prisoner’s services would not be absolutely
necessary to his firm during the ensuing winter
months (imports being slack and exports slacker),
cancelled his assignment, ordered him seven days
in the gaol-gang, and sent him back “to Govern-
ment.” A word from the firm would have saved
him; but why should it be uttered ? Why should
they keep him for the three months oka dull time,
when Government or some other en p’oyer would
utilise him for that period ? Of course, when they
wanted him again, they would obtain him. In
such matters, the Government was always
obliging to “big people,” and supposing, in the
interval, that the man was assigned to someone
else, well, it would not be difficult to secure a
transfer, for the someone would almost certainly
bo a client of the firm, and would only be too
happy to propitiate gentlemen whose financial
power was so much in evidence.
So he was “returned to Government ” at the
end of his seven days (which he spent chiefly in
washing dormitories), and after another week was
selected by the agent of Major-General William
Stewart of “The Mount,” Bathurst, for that per-
sonage’s assigned service. He knew nothing _of
sheep beyond the circumstance that he had tallied
out of a vessel some “Electoral Saxon rams ” for
the Raby Estate ; and, therefore, he was chosen
as a shepherd, with the understanding that when
occasion required he should act as clerk.
Now, perhaps the Major-General and ex-
Governor was one of the three_ or four men who
didn’t care one dump for Richard Jones and
Co. Financially independent, his magnificent land-
grant, Ins military position, and the prestige which,
attached to him from the circumstance that he
had administered the Government of the colony
for seventeen days, made him respected by the
firm. They could not browbeat him, and, acting
frequently as his factors, they could not object to
Benson’s assignment to him. Almost any other
settler would have received in a roundabout way
an intimation that “ Messrs. Richard Jones and
Co. would be obliged by their not pressing for
the assignment of the man,” and the result would
have been that the ink would scarcely have
dried on Mr. F. A. Hely’s books before that
official, the Principal Superintendent of Prisons,
would have authorized the retransfer to Govern-
ment or back to the firm. Such retransfers were
of almost daily occurrence at this epoch. The
assignment had certain conveniencies ; the only
person disadvantaged was the chattel, Convict
Such-an-One. He would be terribly put about,
for under the Government regulations of ’27 every
retransfer scored as a blackrnark, which deferred
the issue of a ticket-of-leave. It was cruel, you
will say, so to bundle about a human being, and
to punish him for what was mere convenience to
Ids employes or other parties. But then, you see,
it was not cruel in the eyes of the System, for the
convict was not human, being only a number,
or in Governor Arthur’s phrase “ a slave.” You
can't wrong a number, and a slave has no rights.
But this facility of re-transfer did not affect
Penson for the reason we have given. Being
assigned to the Major-General, he was allowed by
the firm to remain in the great man’s service, and
he was soon attached to a party of military pro-
ceeding to Bathurst—to be precise, we should say
he was attached by a strap to the baggage-cart —
and once there he was soon handed over to the
“Mount ” overseer.
* * *
Benson’s removal from the city, we have
hinted, was distressing to Mr. Pounce. New
settlers were coming into the country every day,
and new signatures were, therefore, desirable, for
Mr. Pounce did not believe in working upon only
a dozen or two names in his forged “passes and
tickets.” The more signatures that were available
for the purpose of appending to passes, the less
chance there was of forgery being detected, and
with Benson’s departure he lost one of his most
prolific sources of obtaining new names.
He felt worse, how'ever, when he learnt that Mr.
Giddings-Benson had not the slightest notion of
allowing him to forget the great usefulness of his
services.
Benson, three months after his arrival at
his Western home, wrote to Mr. Pounce the fol-
lowing letter: —
To the care of Mrs. Jessie ,
(under cover),
George-st., Bathurst,
15th August, 1882.
My Dear Friend Pounce,—l have some news for you
which I hope will interest you. First, lam not uncom-
fortable here. lam shepherding at the Plains hut, and
only see the General or the Overseer once a fortnight
when one or the other runs out to see how I am getting
on, and whether I’ve lost any of my charges. They are
severe, but not unjust, and so far I’ve satisfied ’em, and
have already been sent down to the Mount once to write
up some accounts. That is a privilege, let me tell you,
for the General isn’t stingy about the house, though the
rations of his outside men are just up to quality (Regula-
tion quality) and no more. I shall be at the Mount
once a month or so, and I might be worse off. This is
one of the places where if a man does his work he’s all
right, and if he doesn’t his back suffers, and not other-
wise. It is not like ’s and ’s, where if you
open your mouth it’s insubordination, and if you keep it
closed it’s silent insolence, and either way forty
(not save one as the Scriptures order —hope you
read the Scriptures regularly, dear friend) —but forty
with ten added. Well, that’s the first bit of news.
And the second is that I have a business order for you.
I am running down to Sydney on a little job of my own,
and while I,can get by the stockades at Mount Vittoria,
Blackheath and Emu Plains all right, I wish a pass
that won’t disturb a friend that I wish to bring with me.
A youngish fellow he is, tall, lightish-build, about 2(5 to SO,
pock-pitted very slightly, blue eyes, brownish hair, fresh
“eatures. Look sharp, now, my friend, and let me have
it. I know we won’t quarrel as to terms—you’ve made
too much out of me to ask me for more than half your
fees. Of course. I’ll call round when I get down, as 1
shall have to ask you to work off a bit of paper for me
And so, goodbve for the present.
J.G.B.
Surely there was nothing peculiarly annoying
in this communication ? Nor in the enclosure —
an order for tl ss. on Mrs. Jessie ’s Sydney
agent? Well, perhaps not; but, like a certain
description of reptile, the letter carried a sting
in its tail. Which was a postscript:—
P.S.—On second thoughts I’ve made up my mind to
tell you all about it now, so you’ll see the necessity of
acting promptly. You won’t peach on me, for if you do,
by Heavens 1 I’ll take care you’re scragged alongside of
me. I've been fool enough to promise to get a lag girl
to Sydney, and to ship her aboard an English or Dutch-
going vessel. • Sirs. Jessie knew the girl at
home, and as I am on good terms with her—
Madame Jess, 1 mean—and wish to he on better—
I’ve promised to get the girl down to the port. Oi
course, I can only do it on a male pass. But it isn’t
getting her down that bothers me—it’s paying her pas-
sage. She is really a good girl, and shall go home good if
1 can help it; otherwise there would be no difficulty, but
being square she will have to be paid for in hard dollars.
I don’t see any other way for me to raise the money than
to, prig, one of the General’s thirds of exchange in favour
of my old master’s —which I can easily do next time I’m
at the Mount office. Then you’ll have to do the needful—
to get the cash. Now, remember, if this leaks out I’ll
swing, but I won’t swing solus. And so, dear friend, may
God bless you !—B.
It was this addition which carried distress to the
heart of the venerable Pounce. It made clear to
him that transport Benson was not going to regard
himself as fully paid for his tracings by guineas
more or less regularly paid, for it was certain that
he intended to exact an equivalent as hush-money
for his services rendered. There was a good deal
of excuse for the powerful denunciation which
Pounce lavished on Benson’s head when he had
read the letter and its postscript,
r “ Swing !” he ejaculated to himself. “ Swing !
You obnoxious fellow, you, if ever I can help you
to swing without risking my own neck, depend
upon it I’ll do so ! ”
The mischief of the case was, however,
that Pounce did not see any way out of the
difficulty, except to permit the letter to go un-
answered. He remembered the Napoleonic maxim
that letters unanswered answer themselves, and
while usually prompt in replying to his corres-
pondence resolved, for this once, to let Benson’s
communication remain unacknowledged. But,
alas ! the Napoleonic maxim did not apply on this
occasion. Benson was not satisfied with silence ;
he wrote the letter with which we open this
narrative.
To such a letter there could, of course, be only
one response. A pass, based upon one issued by
Mr. W. H. Dutton, the well-known manager of
the better-known Riley Estate of Raby, at the
Cowpastures, for a commonplace purpose was
forwarded to “B, in care of Jessie , Bathurst.”
In enclosing the document, Mr. Pounce hoped
that it would serve the desired end, apologised for
tire delay in sending it—which he attributed to
pressure of business—and “desired that his dear
friend Benson would command him in the future
in any way he could prove useful.” When there

was a lie to be prettily told, Pounce was just the
man to tell it. All the same, he anticipated
Benson’s visit with trepidation. “ Working-off ”
—uttering— a bill of exchange vyitli a forged
e ulorsement, was such a ticklish job that even
Pounce had no relish for it.
* * *
The Quixotic Benson in due course re-
ceived the forged pass which'empowered “Tran-
sport Terence...Too!e” to go to' Bathurst and
return thence on his master’s Emma
Lindsay, assigned domestic to Mrs. Jessie ——, of
BatfiuAt, within two days of its receipt disap-
peared from her assigned employ, but it was not
for a week afterwards that her mistress reported
the fact. By which t’me the absconder, alias
Terence Toole, was safe in Sydney. Benson
passed the road-stockades on a pass of the
General’s which he had given on wide terms to the
intelligent convict. It was seldom that gallant
officer and able administrator slipped into over-
much confidence, but he had taken a fancy to
Benson. Upon which kindly feeling, let us say,
the transport intended to work should he be called
to account for any loss to his flock which might bo
occasioned through his absence from the evening
of one ration-day to the morning of the next, a
fortnight later.
That he would be punished, even unto flogging,
if it were known that he had made a secret visit
to the capital, was certain. But he had rarely
seen a soul at his hut from ration-day to ration-
d ijv and lie thought he would run the risk of
absenting himsblf, as Mrs. Jessie was bent on
go' ting her “ townie ” to the ship’s side, and there
wis no safer way of achieving her object than- by
enlisting Benson’s sympathies. If the trip proved
successful—well, Mrs. Jessie wouldn’t promise,
but he might hope, that she would work the
oracle with the General to procure his assignment
to herself, as a consequence of which marriage
would follow.
Mrs. Jessie’s interest in her young friend Emma
Liu Isay would not run, however? to the extent of
providing her with the expense of her passage
home. Upon ccrta'n points of conduct Mrs.
Jessie was lax, d ecidedly lax, and she could hot
at all understand how Emma should decline to
follow the example set by some well-known Old
Sydney society ladies who regularly > 9 went
home” every second year at a cost to their hus-
bands’ pockets of nothing at all. Mrs. Jessie
— would furnish a nag for the absconding
damsel, and would pay expenses en route to the
city, but beyond that not a dump.
“jW’y, lud, Emmy,” she said, “ luk at mo!
I’m free and yer bond, an’ yet, bless yer, I don’t
mind. W’en there was no other way of gettin’
out to my dear ol’ man that’s dead and gone, I
didn’t min’ an’ now I’ve made my fortin. Don’ ye
bo squeamish, Emmy, don’ ye now.”
The girl, however, would not abandon her
virtuous scruples. Not even to gain the passage
home to see her dearly loved mother would she
be complaisant. And Benson, drunken, scampish
Benson, bearing of the dispute supported the
girl’s cause by a prevarication.
“ You know, Mistress ” —he stopped to pour out
another gill from the flask of best Jamaica —“I
was in Jones’ before I was ’signed to the General,
so I got to know most of the skippers and mates.
I’ll fix the girl’s trip up.” Nevertheless, while he
made the statement, he was perfectly assured
that there would be no chance of getting her
“home free,” unless,-unless she did
Well, did what some Sydney “ladies” did.
Vide the report of a certain Supreme Court action
be "ore Mr. Justice Dowling.
The transports’ ride from Bathurst to
-Sydney will take a chapter to narrate by and bye.
If Terence Toole, alias Emma Lindsay, had been
less fervent in her desire to reach her “ ain coun-
tree harae ” again, she could not have survived the
jrurney. If James Giddings-Benson had been less
of a man and more of a criminal, he would not
have landed his charge safe and unharmed at
Pounce’s. That extra service he demanded from
our venerable friend —that he should accommodate
Emma, otherwise Terence, till a chance of ship-
ping her homewards was obtained. And Pounce,
reluctant to yield, had no option but to do so.
Fortunately, the Gilmore was about to sail imme-
diately.
“Don’t grudge me so small a favour, Pounco,
my dear fellow,” grinned Benson. “Just recollect
all the guineas you’ve made through me !”
And Pounce, wishing his obnoxious client at the
devil, smiled in return. There was this virtue
about Old Pounce. If he supplemented his income
(from forgery) by occasional incursions into the
region of black-mail, he was not so blindly
against being blackmailed himself. It was all part
of the System on which Old Sydney was built.
“ Where you couldn’t blackmail, bribe. Where
you couldn’t bribe, cheat.” So Pounce, echoing
a certain great colonist, said in his heart.
And, therefore, when Benson put into his hand
a document which was partly engraved and partly
penwritten, a document which was ornate with
the flourishes of the engraver and an elegantly-
drawn kangaroo, a document which bore the
genuine • autograph (in thick even strokes which
made visible the unflinching character of the
writer) of “ William Stewart, Major-General ; ”
and when Benson desired him to, firstly, alter the
‘ ‘ Third of Exchange ” into the “ First of Exchange ”
and “First and Second” into “Second and
Third,” and, secondly, to endorse it with the then
running signature of “Richard Jones & Co.
Pounce complied.
Here is the document, translated from the
original :
No. 811. £lOO os. Od. sterlg.
Sydney, October 23rd, 182-.
New South Wales.
At Thirty days’ sight pay this, my Third of Ex-
change, First and Second of same Tenour and Date
not paid to the Order of Messrs. Richard Jones <b
Co., of Sydney, the sum of One Hundred Pounds
Sterling as per advice.
To Messrs. Cox & Co., Value Received.
Craig's Court, Charing Cross, Sd. William Steivart,
London. Major-General.
After Mr. Pounce’s delicate fingers had passed
a fine steel blade and an exquisitely-pointed crow-
quill over it, the document read slightly differ-
ently :
At Thirty Days’ sight pay this, my First of Exchange,
oecond and Third .... not paid.
Not very much difference, apparently. Not
sufficient, at all events, when, duly endorsed, it
was presented over the counter of Messrs. Cox,
the Army Agents in London, to awaken their
suspicion. For, by a singular chance, it was
literally the first to be presented of the set drawn
by the Major-General. The true First.of Exchange
did not appear at Messrs. Cox’s for about six
weeks later. Then, of course, it was repudiated.
But, in the meantime, the London agents of the
man who cashed it in Sydney had disappeared.
Very much to Messrs. Cox’s regret, they could
not trace him, and they had to pay the amount.
So, at least, we judge from their letter before us.
# # *
Being cashed in London, you will, o
course, infer the draft was cashed in Sydney. So
it was —by Mr. Pounce —in the private room of a
very honourable person indeed.
It was a characteristic of Old Sydney life, which
would have been curious did it stand alone as
proof that Governments never see further than
the tips of their noses, that, right in the heart of
the city’s legitimate commercial institutions, there
flourished and prospered appliances for developing
every form of illegitimate enterprise, and for
utilising every variety of ingenious scoundrelism.
By one of such irregular channels, Pounce, at
Benson’s behest, cashed the forged bill of exohange
—at a discount of GO per cent. !
“Too heavy, Mr. Pounce!” exclaimed the
Irregular Channel. “Too heavy! Look at the
risk. Mr. Pounce!”
“My principal instructed me not to pass it at a
heavier rate than 35 per cent !”
“Ha, ha! very good, Mr. Pounce!” laughed
the I.C. “ Sixty per cent. —or nothing !”
“Nothing ? ”
“Yes, nothing! Take my terms —or—this—
bill-goes-into Mr. Jones’hands. Did it—come
honestly—into—your hands —Pounce? ”
Mr. Pounce took the forty pounds. And never
felt easy in Ids mind again till he heard from the
Irregular Channel that the bill had been duly
honoured on presentation.
# * *
As it was not safe for Benson to appear
in the streets, Pounce saw Emma Lindsay, no
longer alias Terence Toole, but now alias Eliza
Lawson, on board the good ship Gilmore ; Geary,
master, bound for London direct. Thirty pounds,
sterling (not currency) was paid for her passage.
She tendered Benson a kiss as she parted with
him in Pounce’s parlour.
AT THE WATERLOO CYCLORAMA.
(Corporal Jeremiah Brown, Inniskillen
Dragoon, well-known as the “Waterloo Veteran,”
still does duty at the Melbourne Cyclorama,
although the old fellow is nearly 100 years of
age.)
He : “ See that old gent in uniform? That’s a Waterloo hero!”
She : “ Dear me! Did such old men win the Battle of Waterloo ?”
“Oh, Mr. Benson, how can I thank ye?” she
said tearfully.
“By keeping square for the future, lass !” he
replied. And then shaking hands, re-applied
himself to Pounce’s rum.
* * #
He was pretty drunk when Pounce re-
turned. But yet sober enough to bowl that
worthy out.
“Did ye give the girl the balance of the pro-
ceeds ? I ought to have given it her myself.”
“Of course I did!” rejoined Pounce, in hurt
tones. “ I knew you’d ask me, and so to satisfy
you I took her receipt.” He held out a slip of

“ Breakers Ahead!”
That cry has brought,, terror to many a stout
heart. A shipwreck is a frightful experience, to
hear the wind whistle, the timber creak and crash,
the cordage strain, the sailors swear and the
women scream, tremble and run hither and thither
like maniacs, is enough to appal the bravest
heart. Yet with all its terrors death by shipwreck
is not half so terrible as tho slow and insidious
course of disease, which for the latter years of the
stricken one’s life, makes existence a misery, not
only to the victim but to all around him. With
such terrible facts staring us in the face, how
careful we should be to preserve that blessing of
providence —health and strength. Note should be
taken of the first signs of disease. A simple
headache is an infallible sign that the liver and
stomach are disordered ; frequent toothache and
neuralgia indicate infallibly that the nervous
system is becoming enervated ; that tired feeling
rs proof positive that strength is failing. There
are hundreds of such symptoms which _ should
iiave immediate treatment. Clements Tonic forti-
fies the blood and builds up nerve tissue ; it is the
greatest regulator of the system ever introduced,
and thousands of grateful sufferers testify to this
fact. For instance, Captain IL Dibden, Master
Balmain Ferry Boat, was for years an acute
sufferer from nervousness, debility and chronic
dyspepsia. He had recourse to Clements Tonic,
which effectually cured him. He says Bal-
main.—Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in giving
my evidence in support of the value of Clements
Tonic. For a long time I suffered"frbm Indiges-
tion and debility, and tried many remedies with
but little benefit. Seeing Clements Tonic adver-
tised, I tried it, and after the first bottle I felt
quite a change, and am now a new man altogether,
and shall be glad to afford anyone further informa-
tion if desired. And Mrs. Woodlands, Port
Macquarie, suffered from Sluggish Liver, Hepati-
tis and Dyspepsia. She took three bottles
Clements Tonic and tho pain was completely gone
and perfect health restored. She writes : —Port
Macquarie, N.S.W. —Dear Sir, —For many years
I have been suffering from very severe pain in the
side and indigestion. I tried all sorts of remedies
and consulted many medical men, but got no
relief. I tried Clements Tonic, and before I had
taken three bottles the pain in my side was com-
pletely gone, and I never felt so well in my life
before. And Mr. S. D. Wood, Verger of All
Saints Cathedral, Bathurst, and a most reputable
and respected citizen of “the City of the Plains,”
frankly endorse# this wonderful remedy. He
says.:—Howick-street, Bathurst, January 30th,
1890. Dear Sir, —I have lately been taking Clem-
ents Tonic with such wonderful results that I am
induced, as a matter of justice, to send a plain
statement of my case, which you are at liberty to
publish in the interest of similar sufferers. For
some years I have suffered acutely from indiges-
tion, giddiness, languid tired feelings, no inclina-
tion for exertion, humming noises in the ears—
this symptom being especially troublesome —and
extreme lowness of spirits. I tried many “cures ”
which did me no good. I eventually used Clem-
ents Tonic, and the second dose completely cured
the noises in my ears, and during recent attacks
they were worse than ever before, but, thanks to
Clements Tonic, before the first bottle was used
my general health was greatly improved* and I
can truthfully state that it is far superior to any
other medicine I ever took, and I honestly, believe
that all sufferers will derive great and permanent
benefit from its use. All unpleasant feelings have
entirely left me, and I shall always use Clements
Tonic when out of sorts. It is a grand pick-me-up,
and lam thankful that I gave it a trial. There
can be no doubt even in the most sceptical mind,
after such proof as this.

Society.
The notices of sittings in the N.S.W.
Divorce Court no longer appear in the law-list,
and one of the dailies remarks that “ the reasons
for the change appear difficult of explanation.”
The reasons are not at all difficult of explanation.
In the M‘Millan case—for reasons which are per-
fectly apparent to the world —an exception was
made from the usual order of things by carefully
expunging all mention of the cause from the list
and practically hearing it in camera. Some
of the papers insolently made a fuss about this
and wanted to know why a man who happened to
be a Q.C. or a Colonial Treasurer should in such
matters have special privileges extended to him.
The Court’s answer to this piece of healthy criti-
crism is to publish no divorce-list all, thus enabling
itself to do as it “ darned well likes.”

In New South Wales, before a couple are

it be necessary in a civil State to make such a
concession to clericalism ? In lots of cases people
don’t get civilly married because of any con-
scientious scruples at all. They go to the
registrar because he is rather cheap (though £l, the
official fee, should be promptly reduced to half-a-
crown), because they hate display, and like
“ promptness and despatch.”

Interesting extract from a coffin-circular
issued by a Sydney firm of undertakers to the
medical profession :
The principle recognised is—(l) thorough destruction
of the corpse in some cases ; (2) in others disintegration
with disinfection and absorption, and upon this principle
the construction of the Sanitary Coffin is based, the
medical profession in most cases deciding which form it is
to be.
Briefly, its construction is as follows: —Into any ordinary
coffin is placed another coffin of peculiar construction —
that is, it is made of perforated zinc (for reasons which
follow), and of such dimensions as to provide a cavity
below, around, and above of about an inch, for the recep-
tion of medicated absorbent material.
The special feature is that this coffin can be made to
accomplish the process of cremation, and in such a way
as to avoid shock to the feelings of relatives and friends —
in fact, it can 1)3 so carried out that it need not he known
to the relatives and friends what takes place. At the
same time, when only used in a modified degree (which
will be presently explained), it most effectually disinfects
and deodorizi s the co.pse and ils surroundings.
If it is intended to cremate the corpse, then the cavity
between the two coffins is filled with a composition repre-
sented by Formula Aor Formula B. The crematory pro-
cess would, of course, be slower with Formula B than
-with A, but it would eventually he accomplished. If a
modified process is intended, then Formula C or D would
be used. (For Formula) see below.) A medical man would
order or recommend a & Co.’s Patent Sanitary
Coffin A, B, C, or D, and while it would be known to him,
to the relations and friends it would be pratically un-
known what the letters A, B, C, and D meant. It may bo
mentioned here for information that zinc is the metal
most susceptible to the action of quicklime.
Formula A.
Quicklime only.
Oil of Sanitas or Eucalyptus Oil being-added in some cases.
Formula B.
Quicklime and Sawdust in equal parts.
Oil of Sanitas or Eucalyptus Oil being added in some cases.
Formula C.
Sawdust and Eucalyptus Oil.
Formula b.

“An Irish Surgeon” points out in a
Sydney daily that Irish medical men are absolutely
excluded from the staff of Prince Alfred Hospital,
Sydney, where eight of the doctors have English
and,nine Scottisli diplomas. This, provided it
can be shown that there are competent Irishmen
available, looks as if the hospital had got into the
hands of a clique, and additional colour is sought
lobe lent to the latter theory by a reference to
thecertainly monstrous mis-statements lately made
by the hospital’s President, Sir William Manning,
in regard to the circumstances of the attempted
assassination in Sydney of the person after whom
the hospital is named. The occurrence of such
cliquism is deplorable. There should be no
nationality either in charity or science. The
Bulletin notices that up to date the hospital
authorities have made no reply to “ Irish Sur-
geon’s” letter.

Is it really true thatfhe N.S.W. Fisheries’
Inspectors receive half of all fines and half the
value of all confiscated nets ? If it be true, then
the system is a most corrupt and disgraceful one,
as it must inevitably lead to the officials being the
advocates of their own pockets and setting them-
selves up as judges in their own cause. We are told
that two years ago the “pet inspectorwho-
ever he may be—of the Commissioners received
£4OO for his share of fines and confiscated nets.
What chance can a working-fisherman have under
such a system ?

la 1840 the N.S.W. “aristocracy” pro-
posed that a Doomsday Book should be-issued
recording every family in the colony, and if its
members had come out “free” or “bond.” The
opposition of Dr Ullathorne, and other “free”
selectors, frustrated the designs of the exclusive
party, and the scheme was “waddied.” Some of
“our first families” now would scarcely care to
see a copy of such a work in their own (or other
people’s) libraries.

A strong “sensation” is nowon in the
fast and fiery North. A rich and buxom widow,
the well-preserved remnant of the marriage of the
season of half a generation ago, has long been
credited with casting longing eyes upon a gay and
gallant, but gray-headed, captain. If 'Mrs.
Grundy’s whisperings are to .be believed, the lady
—for she belongs to the Pure Merino aristocracy—
has for some time done her best to sati fy her
longings by continuously travelling to Europe and
back in the noble seaman’s vessel. But ordinary
means failed. Like the lady in “Juvenal,” she
could never get enough of her captain, not even
though she got him “a soft billet ashore,” for his
lawful partner came out from ’ome and made
tilings Imm when she found herself expected to
play Leah to the darling Rachel. So a few weeks
ago the fond pair bade adieu to the conventional
and left the sunny shores of Australia for the
equally sunny shores of Peru, where wives may
cease fromtroublingand lovers be at rest. A flavour
is given to the elopement by the fact that both
parties were high in favour at Government House,
and that the captain took a couple of his boys
with him, while the lady is reported to have
settled £5OO a year upon her abandoned rival.
Certainly, we are becoming quite modern in our
scandals. Of old, it was the men who ran off
with the women.

Government Resident Douglas, of Thursday
Island, has “received information” (we’re glad
John hasn’t seen it himself) of a “strange monster
which was ashore on Sandy Cape for two days”: —
It roughly resembles an immense many coloured carpet
snake with a fish’s tail, with a great domed carapace
amidships. The animal is described as evidently an
hybrid between a sea-serpent, a turtle, and a whale, and
is stated to be 36fc. long, sft. high when standing up, and
possesses feet like a crocodile. It has a square-cut face,
somewhat like the sperm whale ; dirty yellow colour ; two
large eyes ; the mouth, set with large teeth, always open
when out of water. The tail end is about the same length
as the other, light blue and red in colour, and terminates
in a wedge-shaped tail like that of adugong. The domed
back is of a dull slate-grey.
We know the thing at once from its plans and speci-
fications —it is the fantodsia amphibia jimjamja.
It,has been stationed at the Island ever since the

Women’s Rights arc sailing along. Mrs.
Parkinson was last wee k bound over by Castle-

His lawyer had reduced *to writing her grace
before meals, which she delivered daily: “Oh,
God, have pity on me, and relieve me of my
adversary. Remove him from the .earth. Take
away the big grub. Remove him that someone
may take his place. Choke him, choke him.
Answer me, or I will weary Thee, will weary

There is to be trouble when S.A. Parlia-
ment meets about Government paying Governor
Kintore’s trans-continental picnic expenses,
especially as it is rumoured that the whole busi-
ness has a great deal to do-with the investment of
capital by an English syndicate in the Mac Donnell
Ranges. The great question is: Does’Kintore
represent capitalists ? He said recently
I am convinced that the mineral resources of. the Mac-
Donnell Ranges warrant the expenditure of capital.
This has caused most people to prick up their ears-
If touring thh continent alongside the telegraph-
line with a good equipment and cases of whisky is
true exploration, then we' will turn explorers to-
morrow, especially if the Government pays ex-
penses.

The Bulletin deeply sympathises, with
Rev. S. Knight, of the Wesleyan Church, in the
irreparable loss he lias sustained by the death, at
Vienna last week, of his gifted and industrious
Victorian-born daughter, Dr. Adela Knight, who,
after a brilliant career at London University,
where she graduated in medicine and won the
Helen Prideaux scholarship, has died in her 26th
year. At the time of her untimely demise, the
cause of which is not yet known in Australia, Miss
Knight was a student at the great Austria,
ynsecological school.

The Luiuwa police have only succeeded m
discovering the man who didn’t commit the last
Whitechapel murder. The-“ Ripper” rips, and
let him rip !
The Sydney express was just about start-
ing from Melbourne station the other day when a
wild-looking youth fled along the platform drag-
ging an exhausted girl by the arm and humping ;a
large quantity of luggage. He butted the lady
into the first empty compartment he saw, and
threw himself and a cataract of bandboxes after
her, and then he tipped a porter two-and-six, in
consideration of which the latter locked the door.
A moment or two later a conventional heavy father
burst in, bowling over the ticket-officer as he
came, and gallopnng on his prostrate form ; he
clung to the door-handle, but couldn’t get it opeij.
Then he put his head in at the window and bade
the girl come out and return to her parents, but
the youth, who was pale and hairless, but with
the light of a great resolution shining in his eye,
got up and shoved him back. The girl retreated
into the furthest corner of the carriage and wept,
but the indignant father hit out with his umbrella
and destroyed her lover’s hat, and the lover
defended himself with a bandbox. Next the old
man tried to crawl in at the window, but was
hauled back by an official, and the youth leaned
half-way out and started to harangue the multi-
tude and explain the situation. Just then the
engine started, and the stout father, growing
apoplectic with rage, burst from the porter who
held him and ran after it to get a last whack at
the erring pair through the window; but he was
too fat to do more than overtake the last carriage,
and as he ran frantically alongside and pounded
the rear of the train with his umbrella, a yell
of wild derision went up from the audience.
Somehow, a short, stout, elderly parent never
gets much sympathy from the mob.

At Balmain (Sydney) the other day, a
loan-office man (not a Hebrew) cleared the house
of a debtor of everything except a little bedding.
Pour young children—one of them but three
months old—were moved on to a mattrass in a
corner and the bedstead taken. Everything was
cleared off, even a little tea and sugar and the tea-
pot. The wretched people were so bewildered
that they saved nothing, not even their marriage-
certificate. It was all included in the bond.

An old and genuine grievance, against
touting in cemeteries, crops up again in the Sydney
press wherein “Pro Bono Publico” and Co. pro-
test against their sobs over the long homo of their
MORE COMPETITION.
IKEY MO (the famous diamond duke): “Vat’s this? 500,000 more on ’em emigrating to
Haustralia—another half-million books open on the Melbourne Cup. Vy,
Lazarus, we shall have to trow up an honest livin’ and work.”
Bud in Heaven being disturbed by a red-haired
mason hoarsely urging the virtues of his handi-
work, whilst another tombstone-artist on the
other side assures them in a voice of thunder that
his firm alone constructs memorials which don’t
stagger on their foundations. The idea of touts
in a graveyard is quite against the bestowed
“sentiment” of the place where the weeping
widow plants boiled seeds over her decomposing
dearest or adorns his earthly bed with tin wreaths
and conch-shells, and finally dissolves in woe on to
the coping—with one streaming eye on the widower
across the path who is disconsolately wiping the
spiders off dear Maria’s epitaph with his mourn-,
: ng handkerchief.

Someone writes to The Bulletin com-
plaining that one member of the bar, at a recent
N.S.W. Circuit Court, was allowed to defend all
the prisoners, who had engaged four particular
attorneys at a lump sum. Our correspondent
wants to know what a bar-committee, were there
one, or the punctilious Attorney-General would
say to such conduct. The Bulletin doesn’t care
what the Attorney-General may say, as it is to the
interest of the public that prisoners, attorneys
and barristers shall be allowed to make any
arrangements as to payment that may suit them.
In other words, the public want absolute Free-
trade in law.
An enterprising inventor is about to supply
Sydney (if the capital can be raised) with a
“long-felt want”—in the form of an adequate
supply of public “ conveniences ” on the penny-in-
the-slot principle.
Lady Jersey, as a Melbourne paper has
learned with no less joy than astonishment, thinks
nothing of calling her husband George—plain
George —in the hearing of their humble worship-
pers. This beautiful touch of Nature, so
suggestive of the Queen and Royal I amily, is said
to have sent a thrill right through Sydney
sassiety—a true bill which The Bulletin doesn t
hesitate to endorse.
The British House of Commons is consider-
ing a Bill for the suppression of the Italian organ-
grinder and flute obligato fiend from Shairmany.
It provides that whenever these monsters com-
mence to shudder and moan on any instrument
outside any inhabited premises, the householder
may move them on upon his own responsibility
for a distance of 440 yards. The organ-demon
must go at once and without remonstrance, else
he is liable to arrest. He must not toot on his
weapon of torture as he goes, else he is also liable
to arrest. When he has gone he must remain
away—if he comes back and blows his tuneful
melody within the prohibited line he is liable to
arrest some more. When he gets to the end of his
journey and starts to fill the air afresh with the
ruins of his wild, sad song, and another house-
holder rushes out and orders him to go another
440 yards, he must go at once, else he will be
arrested instantly ; and if a third individual drops
on him before he has ground out the first bar of
his tale of woe he must simply keep on going. He
must do it cheerfully, too ; if he blasphemes as he
makes his twenty-seventh removal he will be
arrested on the spot. If anybody within a quar-
ter of a mile of him in any direction objects to his
wail and lamentation he must pack up at once
and put 440 yards between him and the com-
plainant—failing which he will be run in. If
there is a yard short in the measurement, he will
be jugged at once. If there are individuals in all
directions who complain of him, then he must
simply get out of the locality altogether, other-
wise he will be copped straight off. It is a far-
reaching Bill, and promises to be very successful,
but the wear and tear of the organ-grinder will be
tremendous.

A certain well-advertised and plausible
Melbourne detective was standing at the pit-
entrance of the Royal, talking to the ticket-taker,
when a smart youth, with an air of tremendous
mystery, slipped a card into his hand. The
vigilant officer walked towards the lamp and read :
“Always tell the truth and you w ill be happy.
And now, whenever a larrikin, card in hand, ap-
proaches a policeman, the latter gets his foot
ready for action.

Hunks and Dunks are squatter neighbours
in the north of West Australia. Dunks one day
passed Hunks’ homestead and ventured to
“ borrow a fill of tobacco.” “ Take a stick,” said
Hunks, and a fig of the weed changed hands. A
few days later came an account: “To one fig of
tobacco, Is.” On another occasion Dunks got out
of Hunks’ store one clay pipe, five nails, and a
twopenny stamp. Billed accordingly. Some
time after, Hunks made a surprise call on Dunks
and produced a bottle of whisky. Dunks’ over-
seer was present. Hunks proposed a “ wee dram.”
Carried nemconiously. Dunks and his overseer
began to think old Hunks wasn’t such a desper-
ately bad fellow after all. Just then, in came
Splunks. Moved, seconded, and adopted that
another drink be taken. Then Hunks, ho’ding
the bottle up to the light in order to show by bow
much the seven “snifters” had lowered the flood
level, remarked ; “’Tisn’t any use my taking that
much home ; I’ll leave it with ye, and ye can just
send me another bottle of whusky at your leisure.’

Bishop Webber is boycotting N.S. Wales

Evangelicalism (with a big E) in the “Northern
diocese.” Which Northern one ?

A “ School of Repose ” is doing good busi-
ness at New York. The proprietress maintains
that the hardest thing for a society girl to learn is
how to lie around gracefully on a sofa, or to loaf
elegantly in an easy-chair, without drawing un-
necessary attention to her feet, or sticking her
arms out. She undertakes to teach the awkward
maiden how to do these things, and after three
months’ tuition it is claimed that an intelligent
pupil might fall head-first into a horse-box and
break both her legs, but still, when some kind
friends came to haul her out, they would find her
lying in a high-bred position at the bottom of the
box, and looking calm and reposeful even amid
her sufferings.
When people are specially bad
And get themselves into disgraces,
Th rather suggestively sad
To notice in how many cases,
In how many oases religion they libel
By putting on clerical togs,
And' sneaking around, with a hymn-book and
Bible,
Converting the infidel dogs.

Will flop himself down in a kneeling position —
Aii ! many’s the fellow conducting a mission
Who ought to be fattening hogs.
This 11 De,” stuck in front of Cobain,

But what are we hearing from Spain

And therefore began to admonish the heathen
To walk in tlie virtuous way—
O ! yes, O ! yes. _
The wnsser the man, and the higher his station .
The bigger his blot on our civilisation—
The surer he is to go in for salvation,
And teach decent sinners To pray.
In darksome alley, squalid court,
Where wretchedness is rife,
The Ripper prowls in search of sport,
And sharpens up his knife ;
The madman’s light is in his eye,
A sneer upon ins lips,
And languid “ bobbies ” lumber by
The while the Ripper rips
Let him rip !
Another woman, stiff and cold,
Will very soon be found’:
They’ll pop her underneath the mould,
They’ll drop her in the ground ;
But none imagine they will find
The man —he never trips.
The Cable Liar doesn’t mind
How oft the Ripper rips—
Let him rip !
Our troubles! we have grief and care,
The burden on our back
Is weight enough for us to bear,
And never worries Jack.
So to the little cup that cheers
The poet goes for sips :
This life is full of drink and tears,
And still the Ripper rips—
Let him rip ! .
BY GEORGE!
O ! Fate is kind, to let us find
(Just bottle up your mirth)
A noble mind and heart combined
In one of noble birth ;
The Lady J., so people say
Who at her table gorge, _
With winning way—hip, hip, hooray .
Calls gentle Jersey “George.”
That lustrous pearl might call him “ Lari,
“ Your Excellency,” “Lord,” ( (j
Or show her love by screaming “ Gov.
Across the festive board ;
But as her game—fair Primrose Dame
Is “ loyal ” links to forge.
She gives her flame his Christian name,
And fetches ’em with “George.”
Depew’s Notion.
The Hon. Chauncey M. Depew carries a very
heavy life insurance. His notion is that it is
worry and anxiety that shorten the lives of most
business men ; that the worry is chiefly owing to
their anxiety to leave their families provided for
when they die. So he carries £120,000 insurance
on his life ; few can afford to carry as much, and
many will think the care of such an amount likely
to cause worry and anxiety. Too much money is
sometimes as great an anxiety breeder as too
little. The very wealthy are not usually the
longest lived. Worry begets ill-health more than
hard work, no doubt. People who worry the
most about their health seldom have the best.
Those who never have time, or take time, to think
they are sick, seldom are. There are none how-
ever, who can hope to be always well; accidents
or exposure bring low the healthest; but there is
no sense in giving up hope the moment one is
stricken down. A gallant officer of the late war
was struck down by a cannon ball at Gettysburg.
He was carried to the rear and examined by a
'surgeon, who told him : “You cannot live.”
“You lie,” he replied; “I will live.” And he
did. Will power keeps many men above ground
who would otherwise be in their graves. It is
commonly believed that kidney disease is in-
curable, but it is not. To be sure, thousands
succumb to it every year. It was a regular
scourge in'years gone by; but nowadays thousands
of persons write to us every year, as does Mr. W.
Stagg, of Castlemaine, Victoria. “For seven
years or more, I have been a martyr to kidney
disease, which gave me so much pain and trouble
that I apprehended the most serious consequences.
I cheerfully acknowledge that with the use of
three bottles of Warner’s safe cure the disease
was eradicated.” And Mr. Joseph White, of
Warrnambool, Victoria, says, “ Towards the end
of 1889, I was suffering from a severe form of
kidney disease, which was gradually undermining
my strength. For some time, though aware that
health was failing, I felt no pains, but in time I
was afflicted with pains in the regions of the
kidneys. After the use of a number of bottles of
Warner’s safe cure, my pains ceased, my appetite
improved, and I grew strong again - ”
“Schnapps for my money, and a bonus
for nothing,” said a Burwood man who dropped
into Roberts’ Hotel, corner George and Market
streets, Sydney, and purchased two bottles of the
celebrated Wolfe’s schnapps, when he discovered
within each wrapper a £1 order on Messrs. Moss
&Co., Wynyard Lane, who are Messrs. Wolfe’s
sole agents. —Fact.
It is a good rule to accept only such medicines
as are known to be worthy of confidence. It has
been the experience of thousands that Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral is the best medicine ever used for
throat and lung diseases.

mental in passing the measure?” (3.) A note of any
chartered bank is a legal tender...." P.T.W.’ : The
widow in such a case could, of course, “ make a claim,
but she would not succeed unless she proved “to the
satisfaction of ” the Civil Service Board—whose members
both interpret the Act and ad ninister the Superannuation
Fund-that she is “absolutely destitute” and unable to
earn her own living,..." R.A.G.” : \ erse good ; story un-
intelligible “J.G.G.”: We wouldn’t heave such an

Train who took his wife over to Yankeeland in order that
his son might be born there and become President ? And

it is a wise limitation. (3.) The President can be deposed

We read letters for useful facts, and as we get about 850
letters weekly we haven’t time to wade through pages of

Thanks, but we had already written “ P.0.C.” : Never
heard of kerosene being taken internally, except by acci-
dent; The man who takes kerosene may-though we
much doubt it—cure his rheumatism, but he will spoil
his palate... “T. J. Fitz.”: You don’t mention date We
never keep such letters—and never send one corres-
pondent’s letter to another correspondent. Besides, it
does not at all follow that you are the person alluded to.
“Fitzes” grow on every tree and are located in every
bottle.... “B.M.”(Blackall): The connection, under the
circumstances, was monstrous, and a disgrace to the
magistrate. For revenge, we must await the not distant
day when the Democracy accede to office and remorse-
lessly dismiss every official who has systematically
pandered to monopolistic interests at the expense of

Benson established a Permanent Building Society before

Yes ; “ Old Sydney Tales ” are as essentially historical as
“Tales of the System,” or “Tales of the Old Rbgime.”
Occasionally they will not fit in to the order of events by
a year or two, but that is by design. In this story, while
the main incidents occurred much as related, several
slight anachronisms have been purposely introduced in
order that there should be no confusion of identity when
the same characters re-appear in a later “Tale.” For
instance, at the epoch of this story, Lieutenant-General
Stewart was merely a “ Colonel,” not attaining his full
staff rank till a year or two later, and, in the same way,
“ Riley, Jones, and Riley,” as the style of the well-known
merchant firm did not merge into “ Richard Jones & Co.”
till 1830. But as both firm and officer are to be introduced
in future stories under their later and better-known
titles, it has seemed desirable to “Price Waning” to pre-
serve uniformity in designation, even at the risk of being
a little out of order of date “H.H.C.C.”: Thanks
“T.” (Inverell): “P.W.” desires to say he will write on
his return to Sydney. The information you desire can be
supplied “ 8.F.D.” (Mount Gambier); Thanks
“ Little Marks ” : We have heard it argued that scarlet is
the hardest colour to hit “John Sheridan”: Sorry,
none left “A. Montgomery”: Will consider “New
C.”: An aboriginal is almost always 10 years younger
than he looks “Bush Girl”: Trollope’s best is “The
Small House at Allington” ; Hardy’s best is “Far from
the Madding Crowd.’ “N.N.”: The Shenandoah was
delivered up, by Capt. Waddell, to the U.S. Consul at
Liverpool “Hugh Murdoch”: Thanks... “Susan”:
Will read if sent “ Bendigonian” : We do not guarantee
it, but believe it to be thoroughly genuine “J.W.T.”
(Footscray): Article excellent...." Felix Aust ” : Thanks.
“Pearce and M'Laughlin”; Will communicate with
you within a week or so “E. J.”: Sir John Robertson’s
was a “public” funeral. The distinction between this
and a “state” funeral is that at the latter all officials
appear in uniform, judges in their robes, &0., and the
country pays for it. (Many answers held over.)
WHAT EXPERIENCE TEACHES
IS BEST.
There is something to consider in the daily
expenses for the household necessities, which in
the aggregate of the year amount to a good deal.
The ethics of buying and selling appear to be for
the vendor to get all he can, and for the purchaser
to see that- he don’t get too much. But what is
too muoh ? It is almost a profound question, and
presents the strange paradox that the dearest in
many things is often the cheapest. Certainly this
is so in food, when health is involved, and in
remedies.which restore health after it has been
impaired. It is certainly so in clothing; for a
cheap suit that will hardly last one season is dearer
than the one which will last two seasons, the
difference in price being reasonable. So in shoes
and the like. Recurring to the items of food and
health, undoubtedly the most important, it is
found that villainous adulteration is what renders
cheap much that is sold, and men are known who
have spent thousands to be cured of disease, have
suffered years of agony, and have trifled away
their substance on worthless remedies. That
which is testified to by thousands as being an
absolute cure, and permanently efficacious, is
cheap at any price in comparison with such as
have no virtue, and which prolong suffering. A
case in point is the following ; “ New Bloomfield,
Pa., April 26, 1886. The Charles A. Yogeler Co.,
Baltimore, Md. Gentlemen, —For more than
thirty years I had been afflicted with rheumatism
so severe I had to use morphine to secure rest at
night. Spent hundreds of dollars with physicians
and for remedies without benefit. Five years ago
I tried St. Jacobs oil, and it affected an entire and
permanent cure. I have not been troubled with
it since. Cold or damp weather does not affect
me at all. I desire to give it my unqualified
endorsement.— J. E. Bonsall, clerk of the several
Courts of Perry Country, Pa.” The point here is
not so much what Mr. Bonsall paid for the great
remedy for pain, for the price is a mere bagatelle,
but that he was permanently cured after 30 years’
suffering. Of course the poor must count the cost
in everything; but they should reckon on the
sound basis that that which is bad is worthless,
and that which is the best and will cure, and stay
cured, is cheap at any price.
TEXAS SIFTING.
F. G. Presby, Marshall, Texas, April 14, ’9O,
writes the Waterbury Watch Co. as follows: —
“Though a stranger to you, I wish to let you
know something that happened to me in the
spring of 1889 on account of one of your Water-
bury Watches. I left my home in Pensacola City,
Fla'., to find anew one farther west. Coming to
Denver, Colo., and having travelled all over the
Rocky Mountains without any watch in my
pocket, as I was coming one day from my place to
Denver, Colo., after I had got my place in order,
I came to look over the city. My intention was
to go to Kansas City, Mo. I passed one watch-
maker’s store on Larimer-street, in Denver, and
saw there a watch in the window for only 2dol.
50c. I went in and I bought one, paid the money
for it, and left the city next day for Kansas City,
Mo., in the 1 p.m. train. After I was about one
hour’s ride from the city the conductor of the
train came and took a seat by my side. I asked
the conductor the time, and as a gentleman he
told me the time, and I said I also have my watch
to tell me the time. As soon as the gentleman
(conductor) of the train espied my watch he com-
menced to laugh, and told me at the same time
that he could get a bushel of such trash as Water-
bury Watches, all he wanted, for one dollar, while
I had paid 2dol. 50c. But I did not lose rny
courage, and told the conductor that I would bet
a cigar, only first I was not a betting man, and
secondly that my Waterbury Watch for 2.50d01.
was just as good as an Elgin or any other 250.00d01.
watch, in regard to keeping good time. The
conductor accepted the bet. Nearing Kansas
City next day I notified the conductor about our
bet. When we reached Kansas City my 2.50d01.
Waterbury Watch was correct and the conductor’s
watch from Elgin, 111., was 1J minutes behind
time, so the Waterbury Watch won the bet. 1
have received the cigar, have set fire to it, and am
enjoying the smoke.”

POLITICAL POINTS
instead of, as at present, merely framing an im-
potent recommendation where they convict but
wish mercy to be extended. Within a very few
years the jury, and not the judge, will, in Aus-
tralia, be the arbiter of life and death, and only
criminals who have committed murders for gain
or other equally base motives, will be executed.
The present Procrustean bed of prison quicklime
must go.
The Bulletin urges the people of Victoria
flatly to refuse the franchise to women owning
property “as an instalment towards complete
female franchise ” (vide Premier Munro’s proposal
to a female vote deputation, the other day.) The
typical property-owning female is the most arrant
snob and the most unrelenting enemy of the
sovereign people on the face of the earth, and
every vote given to her would be used against
political progress, and especially against the
enfranchisement of her un-propertied sisters. The
Bulletin advocates female suffrage only because
it wants to see the working-woman’s vote east for
Democracy.
If the Single-taxers are true to the demo-
cratic cause they will be prepared to vote for
Protectionist candidates when the latter are nomi-
“Freedom of contract ” is freedom for a
class ; bondage for a people.
Melbourne Age declares that “ the fate of
Federation lies in the hands of the electors of New
South Wales.”
“The strike,” says Colonial Secretary
Tozer, “has already cost Queensland more than
three millions sterling.”
Sir George Grey speaks in the Sydney
Centennial Hall on 26th instant, and will get an
ovation. Who dare predict disturbances on the
occasion ?
“Ah Sin Bing” proposes, through the
Queenslander, that the Government should give
every Chinaman £5O and a free passage home.
Cheap and good idea.
One thing that Federation will achieve
will be the amalgamation of the judiciaries of the
several colonies. Hooray ! One People, One
Destiny, One Hangman.
Secretary Blaine and Naval Secretary
Tracy, U.S., insist that the nation must have a
navy equalling England’s, and their hands will be
prodigiously strengthened by the Chilian occur-
rences last week.
The Bulletin to the electors: —Allow
your avowed enemies a fair hearing on the plat-
form. Not howling, but the ballot-box, is your
weapon. Make all men respect the temper of the
Democracy. Free speech means a free country.
The new West Australian loan will pro-
bably be launched on the London market early in
July. There is no fear for its success, as the
Government have received offers to underwrite
the total amount (£1,300,000) at four per cent, at
a minimum not disclosed.
To would-be political platform speakers
The Bulletin says Write your speech out, con-
dense it to the uttermost, memorise its “ points,”
and carry the MS. in your tail-pocket. If the
electors throw dead cats at you take the hint,
turn the “copy” over to the reporters, bow low
and wish the meeting good evening.
It is said that just before next Queensland
general elections the railway authorities will dis-
cover a sudden necessity for a general transference
of railway employes to fresh districts—where the
transferred will have no vote ! The Townsville
election has shaken the Coalition Government.
Sir George Grey believes in a plebiscite of
the people being taken with regard to the Con.
monwealth Bill. He would—picturesque idea !-'
have the voting “open,” every name tv be re-
corded, Doomsday-fashion, in a “great book,”
which would become a monumental tome for pos-
terity.
The Queensland employers’ associations
raked the country with a small tooth-comb to get
signatures to a document congratulating the
Government on its gatling-gun policy. They
didn’t get over 4000 after six weeks’ raking in
all parts of the colony, and yet We hear about
“ public opinion.”
A revolution in Portugal is to be desired
more from a sentimental than a practical point of
view. The people are at present so miserably
ignorant that they seem to argue in favour of
Republican principles by continuing to endure a
Monarchical form of Government, like the savages
who swear by their nude sovereigns.
Anthony Ogden, who so stoutly contested
the Townsville election in the Labour interest, is
only 25 years pf'age, a Sheffield (Eng.) man, and
an iron-moulder by trade. All through the elec-
tion he did his eight-hours a-day work, only losing
one solitary half-hour. That’s the style of man
Labour needs as a representative.
The fiat has apparently gone forth in
Melbourne Age office that John Hancock, M.L.A.
—elected for Colling wood by the Labour Party
despite the Age’s opposition—is to be ignored.
“Mr. Hancock also responded ”—-is the curt
reference to John’s speech at the Eight Hours’
banquet, amid fair reports of all the other
speakers. David Syme knows how 7 to fence.
An enlarged roll of J.P.’s is being con-
sidered by the N.S.W. Ministry—in connection
with the impending general election. The J.P.
system—an outcome of the English feudal system —
is utterly corrupt, and should be abolished, on the
ground that it leads to privileged persons ladling
out justice to themselves and their enemies.
Further, no stipendiary magistrate should be
allowed to belong to any secret society whatsoever.
Upon most festive occasions in the Trans-
vaal “God Save the Queen” is sung ; and when
anyone—be he influential Boer or not—suggests
the singing of the Transvaal Yolkslied —their
national song—he is invariably cried down, either
angrily or mockingly. The Boer, indeed, seems
to be in a minority in all ways in his own country,
and what the British could not effect by force < of
arms, they are gradually, but surely, bringing
about otherwise.
The best speakers at Ballarat Labour Con-
ference were Trenwith, of Melbourne, and Bow-
man, of Brisbane —both bootmakers. T v : th,
having had the show, knows what to say ana now
to say it; Bowman, being a green hand at the work,
ties himself up into some wonderful knots of
speech and comes out with some crushing mala-
propisms. Trenwith talks like a man who wants the
other fellow to be convinced ; Bowman pours it
out like a man who is convinced himself.
A sign of the times is that the Age,
following in The Bulletin’s wake, now advocates
the grading of murders by law—that is to say,
permitting the jury to fix the degree of murder,

liated by the Electoral Labour Leagues. Simi-
larly, Protectionists must vote for Single-taxers
under like circumstances. The first thing to be
done is to get together Parliaments in which
Labour holds at least the balance of power. The
fiscal policy is a mere detail ; therefore, all
democrats should avoid asking questions _at
the hustings concerning it. See how “ Jesuiti-
cally ” the monopolist organs of Sydney and Mel-
bourne seek to split the labour-vote by raising the
fiscal cry !

The City Buffet holds its own against all
other restaurants in the city for well-served
dinners, steaming hot and not tepid as is unfor-
tunately the fault of the other houses. The
ladies’ room, which opens off George-street, con-
tinues to be well patronised, and the roast grouse
is especiady appreciated. Being on a level with
the street is a great feature about the ladies’ room,
as the toilsome mount up countless stairs has no
attractions for the weary shopper.

A deadbeat swagman, it is related by a
contemporary, once “ tapped ” Sir John Robert-
son for assistance. Old Jack emptied all his loose
silver into the astonished cadger’s hand. John
Davies, who was present, remarked frozenly, “ I
expect he’ll spend it all in drink.” “ He’s a
flaming fool if he scarlet well don’t,” replied Old
Jack; “where else can a blank fellow like him
weeping well find any comfort ? I know I san-
guinary well would if I were in his petrified
place. ”
William Yilliers Brown, member-elect for
Townsville, is a son of the first Sheriff of Queens-
land proper. He is a native of Melbourne, and
has run the gamut of jackeroving, banking (with-
out skedaddling) and commercial life, he being
still managing director of a company founded on
the old firm of Aplin Bros. He is only 28 years
old, but has already sat in Queensland Parliament
and was actually offered, but refused, the Treasury
portfolio at the time of the notorious Dickson
secession from Griffith. That an unknown Labour
man like Ogden should run Brown so closely as he
did has frightened all the N.Q. Conservatives
almost as much as if Labour had scored a real
win.
Terrible Earthquake in New Zealand.
Earthquakes in New Zealand are of common
occurrence, and the obvious dangers attending
these strange phenomena has been greatly
counteracted by the erection of buildings least
likely to suffer by it, or to cause human loss of
life. On that score even Wellington, the capital
of the colony, consists mostly of wooden buildings,
Parliament House and Public Offices included.
But a year or two ago an earthquake of such force
and velocity was felt in Christchurch as to un-
roof houses, shake the most solid buildings to
their foundations, and to completely shake to its
soaring summit the top of the famous tower of
Christchurch Cathedral. The writer of this
narrative, it may be added, at the time resided
in a hotel opposite.the Cathedral. By a miraculous
interposition of Providence no life was sacrificed,
but, alas ! the mind grows sad at the mere con-
temolation of the subtle perils which endanger
human life on all sides frojn unseen powers we are
unable to comprehend. The latest New Zealand
files again chronicle volcanic disturbances. If oiir
indispensable cable is interrupted, the cause is
invariably attributed to earthquakes, the original
scene of action of which may have been many
scores of miles distant. The cause is remote, but
the effect is here, and hojy often is this illustrated
in daily life. An uncomfortable sensation may be
felt in the head, and is repeated in other parts of
the body, and all strength and energy subsides.
In time the pains increase to tortures, and all
these effects have a definite cause, and can be
traced to a deranged state of the liver and kidneys.
Exactly such was the history of the condition of
Mr. Thos. Buhner, the well-known hydraulic
engineer, residing at 203 Kent-street, Sydney, who
for nine months or more suffered from enlarge-
ment of the liver, chronic indigestion, with other
ill-effects, and a most obstinate affection of the
kidneys; the secretions of the kidneys were
diseased, while micturating was attended by great
torture. He tried a number of preparations with
but very slight relief, while the large percentage
of alcohol in liquid preparations he took had a
most hurtful effect on his liver, but on having
recourse to Mentiplay’s pills he soon experienced
a vast improvement. He confirms under date,
May 10, 1891“ I have now used two boxes of
Mentiplay’s Pills, since which the secretions of the
kidneys have become perfectly clear, and my
digestive faculties and general health is so vastly
improved that I am again restored to my scientific
and useful occupation.” Messrs. Mentiplay and
Co. guarantee the genuineness of each individual
signature of the testimonies in a sum of £2OOO.
Mentiplay’s Blood Elixir is invaluable for
abrasions of the skin, imparts a beautiful com-
plexion, strengthens the genitive organs, and in-
variably regulates any irregularities of the blood,
while it contains the most superb tonic properties.
Wholesale through Elliott Bros., Limited, Sydney
and Brisbane; Korke, Tompsitt and Co., Mel-
bourne. It must not be lost sight of that the seat
of disease centres in the irregular action of the
kidneys and liver, though the pain is felt else-
where. A neglect of symptoms of ill-health will
disorganise the constitution like an earthquake
convulses nature.
Coorparoo Pottery Works, South
Brisbane.
At a time when almost everyone is complaining
about the extremely hard times and the difficulty
of making a living, let alone going into new lines
of business, it is very refreshing to come_ across
anyone who has sufficient energy to hold his head
up and bestir himself to open up a new line of
industry. This is what, it may safely be said,
Mr. A. James, of Coorparoo, is now doing with
his pottery works at that place. Habitues of
Queen-street, Brisbane, can scarcely have failed
to notice a store fitted up in Messrs. Finney, Isles
and Co.’s block with specimens of crockery, bear-
ing on largely printed placards the information
that the articles on view were the first ever made
in. Queensland. These articles are all from the
works above referred to, which are- not only the
first to start, but which, when in full swing, should
also be the first in other respects in Queensland, if
not in Australia, Such articles as teapots, table
equipage, dishes, &c., are already turned out
wholesale, and a larger output is shortly to be
commenced. Mr. James is fortunate in possessing
what most of the would-be Australian potters
lack, a technical education. From the age of 14
until he was 21, he served an apprenticeship with
one of the south-west of England firms, and
that time gained a thorough practical knowledge
of clays and their properties, of the manner of
testing their shrinkage and other peculiarities,
their treatment, and the chemical combinations
necessary to produce the various glazes and other
embellishments of ordinary crockery. In 1875
Mr. James arrived in Brisbane and found his
special training of little value as regai’ds the
manufacture of earthenware goods. Nothing
daunted, however, he applied as much of it as he
could to the demands of the place, and thereby
found employment amongst builders. From
employe he graduated, by industry, into an em-
ployer, and accepted contracts on his own respon-
sibility. While in this trade he came across the
paddock he at present owns at Coorparoo, and
finding it contained some very good clay deposits,
availed himself of an opportunity to purchase it.
The contract for a brick building led him to start
a brick kiln of his own, with the result that he
discovered the clay that produces the bright
red brick so much sought after nowadays, but not
so easy to obtain. A chance discovery of clay of
other "properties elsewhere compelled him to re-
member his early training, and set his mind at
work to see how he could start a pottery on a pay-
able basis. ,
But, however interesting the manufacture of
bricks may be, the manufacture of the ordinary
tea-cup, tea-pot, or dinrier-plate, &c., is more so.
The clay used for this class of work is also treated
in a different manner. After it has been brought
in from the field it is placed in a pit, where it is
tempered with water until ready for the next
process. This consists of straining it through a
wire gauze sieve (the mesh of which is regulated
according to the ultimate object of the clay) into
a long wide trough, under which fires are kept
burning, and in which the composition is boiled
until sufficiently evaporated to be ready for the
next stage, all the vegetable matter being by
means of the heat completely destroyed. After
being shovelled out on to a platform and pugged,
it is passed on in lumps to the various potters to
be formed into the necessary articles.
Up to the present Mr. James has not been able
to turn out quite such a variety of glaze and
colors as he would like, but this is in consequence
of his not having all the necessary chemicals on
hand. He has now, however, received a con-
signment which will be sufficient to keep him
going for many months, and in the near future he
should be able to give still more extended evidences
of his work. Another class of work, to be shortly
commenced, and for which a special kiln is now
being built, is Bristol ware, a recent experi-
ment having demonstrated that this can also be
carried on successfully at Coorparoo, Then there
are some machines on their way out now by
which tile making, both plain and encaustic, will
also be prosecuted, and tiles of any color, shape
or size (from lin to Gin) turned out by, if neces-
sary, the million. When all these branches are in
full swing Mr. James anticipates employing about
10 times the number of men now at work, and as
this will mean about 200, some idea may be gained
of the rapid strides with which the industry is
going forward. The demand for the articles now
manufactured is already pressing on the supply,
and should the intercolonial trade be properly
opened up, the prospects are boundless, Great
Britain alone exporting crockery to Australasia
equal to an annual value of nearly £200,000. But,
however large the trade may ultimately become,
it will only be a fair reward to the energy, toil,
and perseverance of the founder of the Coorparoo
Pottery Works, South Brisbane.

leave poetic clap-trap out of their speeches and weed that
injured-angel expression out of their bilious orbs, which
ever rests there, even though they have scalded the cat
to relieve their feelings before they leave for the hall of
enlightenment? “Trust the women of your country—
they will not fail you. The majority are poor, loving,
unselfish, devoted to duty,” declaimed one Emancipist at
the recent Sydney symposium, and I couldn’t help feeling
a thrill of conscious virtue until I began to reflect how
many confiding men daily put their trust in the Austra-
lian female and are met a month after marriage with the
lurid light of dyspepsia in their—noses, and their collars
pinned on at the back. Women are at all times what they
want to be. If the domestic r6le suits them they never
go beyond darning and apple-dumplings, but if wider
fields attract—well, the present prevalent spectacle of a
woman popping-up on a platform and (figuratively)
menacing the old man with her umbrella show's how little
“unselfishness” and “duty” have to do with it. “If
every woman could live in a sheltered home, be fondly
loved, and nobly protected, the world might never
have heard of woman’s suffrage,” shrieked another
prophetess, but the lie is given to that prize matrimonial-
ad. by the fact that half the fair agitators are women
who “run ” meek and bewildered husbands whose principal
object in life appears to be to stand about in the gutter
at night to protect madam on the home beat. “ Treat us
as reasonable beings,” said another, at which I couldn't
help wondering what sort of an; idiot she was, for the
reasonable one is ever treated as such by her natural
mash—if she wants to be. As a rule, though, the really
clever female is usually the one who goes in most for
babyish know-nothingness in man’s society. How many
times have 1 seen a woman, with an eye like a gimlet,
showing pretty surprise as a pompous male condescended
to “ enlighten ” her on some subject which she had turned
inside out ages ago ?”
The final lawn-tennis thrill was worked off on the 16th
inst. when the attendance—headed, by Lady Jersey—was
large and deeply-interested—the way in which the heads
moved to and fro watching each player looked as if they
were all being worked by the same string. The frocking
wasn’t very fresh. Lady J., who came with daughter
Beatrice and Lord Ancrum and the youngest son, wore a
silver-grey skirt trimmed with tufts of grey astrachan,
black lace and passementerie visite, bonnet in gold straw-
cream ribbons and pink roses, and cream-kid gloves ; her
little daughter in fawn with fawn-straw hat and ribbons ;
Mrs. (Captain) M‘Neill, all in brownish grey tweed, hat en
suite ; Miss Fosbery in black with white “dickey” and
blue necktie ; Miss Hill in green tartan skirt, green pilot
jacket and small sailor hat with tartan band; Mrs.
Woodin, stone-colour cloth trimmed with bands of otter
fur, small bonnet en suite ; Miss Roberts in moonshine-
green with pink chiffon scarf; Miss Gowland was charm-
ing in a rough grey tweed faced in the front with scarlet
and trimmed with black astrachan, black hat trimmed
with blackbirds;-Miss Marks in electric-blue trimmed with
black guipure ; Miss Farnell in brown with terracotta
scarf; Miss Darley in black—really one could not see half
the people, the crowd was so great. The prizes were dis-
tributed by Lady Jersey after the tournament was over
(about six p.m.), a very late and dank hour indeed. Most
of the silver-ware went out of Sydney, and I must
forgive the spiteful hope expressed by a girl who
scrutinized the guerdons that “ the winners might find
them ‘ plated! ”’ By the way, the smart young man who
superintended the handing over of the prizes to Lady
Jersey, and announced the names of the winners, made
the awkward error of calling up for awards two ladies who
did not happen to be prize-winners, but whom, no
doubt, he considered handsome enough to be awarded
prizes on general principles. I hear that the artful
young man smoothed the matter over in a very adroit way
indeed.
One thing that made me pleased with the championesses
at the recent tennis tournament on Sydney Association
Ground was that they always thanked the scouts for
handing them the balls, whereas the men all snatched
them without a word. Perhaps it was on the principle
that women are civil to men, but always uncivil to women;
whereas there is ever less formality between man and
man. They (the playeresses) didn’t wear such a knowing
swagger, or walk about with 'sunburnt fists thrust into the
hip-pockets of mannish coats, as they did last year, and
much quieter methods were adopted. If girls will gambol
before a two-and-sixpenny public, the more they learn to
efface themselves, the better they look. By the way, in
support of The Bulletin’s theory that men are more
uniformly well-shaped than women, I couldn’t help ad-
miring./the hose-covered undulations of some of the
male-'tennis-players— though only a few wore knickers,
trfe long flannel continuations cf most of them conjuring
weird visions of gaspipe fibulae. One man (in knickers)
with rounded shanks like up-ended lemonade-bottles
wore one of his stockings half-way down—just to show, I
suppose, that there was no deception, ladies and gentle-
men.
Sydney Women’s Christian Temperance Union doesn’t
express itself in very lucid diction, for at a recent
gathering] of the tea and toasts a paper was read to
members “ showing the need for all Christian women to
make a firm stand against any drink being admitted to
their bodies.” Which “need,” if embraced, will trans-
form the lady Christians of Sydney into fowls or guinea-
pigs, which are popularly supposed never to moisten their
gullets, but how the Christian woman is going to do this
without cracking remains to be seen.
Sydney Charity Society held its monthly meeting on
13th inst., when it transpired that while 113 single men
had applied for soup and blankets during April, only three
single women were in the list of the applicants —which
argues well for the grit of local spinsterhood. The
amorous Bridget who lends ear to the tender nothings of
the dustman, should take Warning—with a capital W—
from the fact that 75 married couples swarmed in for
relief during the same period.
Apropos to meetings, at the Sanitary Society’s last
pow-wow at Sydney Town Hall, Dr. Roth spoke very
sensibly on the importance of girls being taught a little
more about their inward mechanism than that ‘ the
waist can be compressed two inches without injury ”
which is the full extent of the physical knowledge
possessed by most of them. And why not? What is the
use of mamma telling Dolly that she mustn’t get her feet
wet if she doesn’t tell her why ? Dolly thinks it is only a
fad of mamma’s and keeps her damp shoes on, while the
father pays the piper. Matrons are only content when
cackling together—dropping into a mysterious whisper at
the approach of the Uninitiated and waiting till the latter
pays the penalty of her ignorance in one way or other so
that their chorus of “ I could have warned you,” can
rise loud and long. But why don’t they? Out of all
their vast experience surely elder women might teach
younger women that a blush or a giggle isn’t the only
reply they should be able to make when a weary doctor is
vainly endeavouring to establish a diagnosis.
Another thing Dr. Roth insisted upon was that no
unhealthy person should marry—but of course he might
just as well talk to the wind. The other day I was a
guest at a wedding-ceremony, grinning my “congratula-
tions ” at a pair of people, one of whom had more than
incipient consumption, while the other’s drawback (the
mother confided to me) was a tendency to paralysis.
Whether the race is becoming so ricketty that doctors can
afford to encourage it to take care of itself deponent
doesn’t know—but it looks decidedly disinterested to see
a professional man showing possible patients how to
keep out of his clutches—whether they listen to him or
not.
At a marriage which will (D.V.) take place in Sydney
shortly, the bridegroom, at least, ought to be letter-
perfect in his responses, considering that he has already
“planted” three wives—the last being dead not quite a
year. Now he is engaged to a girl of twenty, while he is
as grey as a barrel of ashes.
Sydney Hunt Club formally inaugurated the linseed
season on 14th inst., the run commencing in the Ryde
School paddock at three o’clock (quite a dilletante hunting
hour contrasted with John Peel’s, and ending on the lawn
at Curwood. Lord and Lady J. and all the J. girls
witnessed the sport from Mr. Terry’s barouche—Lady
Jersey wearing an Indian red cloak, with velvet yoke and
collar, over a floral silk gown, grey hat; the vice-regal
girls all in cream cap <X pie. ; His Excellency in the blue
hat and yellow boots which he, and not Lady Jersey (who
was not present), wore at the tennis meeting on 11th inst.
The hunt was rather funny, only a handful of men in pink,
and most of the gallant Yoicks were left behind at the
first fence, while the spectacle of a dashingly-got-up
sportsman going round gingerly by the road was of
frequent occurrence. The wise huntsman, if he isn’t
going over everything he comes across, should carefully
avoid dare-devil dressing, which looks distinctly silly as
its wearer lets down the top panel and goes hopping over
the second rail. Lords Ancrum, Chumley, Dr. Cortis,
Major Airey, Captain Lee, Mr. Barton, Mr. Terry, Messrs.
Bennett, were among the riders who were entertained
after the run at informal refreshments at “Curwood,”
Lord Jersey proposing the health of Mr. Terry, and vice
versa.
The distribution of prizes and concert in connection
with the Rowing Club of St. Ignatius College, Lane Cove
River, on 18th inst., was attended by a crowd of (prin-
cipally) ladies, Mrs. O’Connor in dark-blue serge, brown
furs and small black capote heading the attendance. The
distribution of prizes waspreceded by a concert, Mr. Alpresg
playing a Legende in a way that forced one to put tender
words to it, and Kowalski—beside rendering his snappy
paraphrase of “Martha” on a rather numb piano—
obligingly sang a French chanson, “ Les Hirondelles ” to
fill up the gap left by the default of M. Deslouis. A
special steamer carried the guests to and from town.
The frocking is only picturesque in “ Siberia,” at Her
Majesty’s—if you except Watts-Phillips’ frock of crimson
velvet over white satin vest laced with gold and long
cloak of grey velvet.lined with fur. Edith Blande, in a
wig the exact colour of a strawberry cow’s hide, looks
pretty in a brown skirt, a yellow sash and a soft white
bodice, but why does she get up her eyes with a daub of
stove-polish round them as if they were in mourning ?
When the company took a call, the effect was positively
“ gashly.” Bessie Rignold looks best in the cream and grey
resurrection of the third act, and Jewett plays the young
bad governor in an excruciating pair of scarlet leggings
which look as if he had been melted and poured into
them, while Handsome George comes to the rescue in
various fur-lined garments more or less reminiscent of
Poverty Point.
Lord and Lady Jersey seem to understand the art of
“ spreading ” their patronage better than the Caringtons
did. Those two amiable creatures usually went to
one show, while another equally-deserving festival lan-
guished for want of the vice-regal fillip. The more brainy
Jerseys go one better, for when two shows are on, “ He”
goes to the one, and her ladyship goes to the other, and
all is right as right can be. It won’t be the Jerseys’ fault
if this vast community doesn’t sob around the railway
station when they are starting on the return-trip.
The other day my eye caught the following awful ad.
in the S.M.H.
QPINSTERS, Bachelors, Widows and Widowers,
dreaming of future unions (confidence, pure and
reciprocal), a reliable medium is invaluable. Apply
Thursday only to Love and Truth, G.P.O.
Now, I have long wanted to scrutinise a Sydney Matri-
monial agency, so I persuaded a male friend to write a
sheepish epistle to that sentimental address, desiring the
man to “ arrange an interview.” I received an answer—
not apparently from the “ reliable medium,” but from a
love-lorn youth of—s 9! who was to meet his unknown
correspondent in the street, and I was to know him by
the fact that he would be wiping his mouth with a cam-
bric handkerchief (I hope he is not still doing so !) He
had fallen in love with my friend’s fist and said it was in-
dicative of a “pure and womanly heart” (poor Fred!)
and that he knew he would be happy with Fred from the
way Fred made capital A. Then he asked if Fred
believed in the Atonement! It was a perfectly dreadful
epistle, with scripture mixed up through it, and Fred
and he were to pray for divine guidance from Above! —
when they met in the gutter ! - As I shuddered through
its creepy pages I couldn’t help wondering whether there
was a woman on earth idiot enough to slink out to meet a
man who, at 59 years of age, was content to make vulgar
rendezvous with unknown correspondents like a school-
boy ! The letter was pot at all what I 'was after, and lam
still in ignorance of the Sydney Matrimonial Office—
this “reliable medium” being apparently an unseen
influence who sends his blushing clients dodging one
another round lamp-posts exhibiting some signal of
distress or other.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

The President of the N.S.W. Legislative Council’ B
annual dinner took place on 15th lost. Among Sir John
Hay’s guests were Earl Jersey, Admiral Scott, nearly all
the Judges, doctors, consuls, “ Parliament men,” and
naval men in town. The proceedings were, as usual, dull
and formal, hut somebody puts in a good word for the
“gold-top.”
The latest Goulburn wedding was that of Miss M. E-
Orridge. elder daughter of Mr. J. W. Orridge, Superinten-
dent of Police, Goulburn, to Mr. \V. H Rothe, “ Fiona,”
Double Bay-. The ceremony was fully floral, the colours
being white and gold, and the bride looked charming in
white satin, rare old point lace and orange-blossoms. The
three maids—Miss Orridge, Miss Gordon, and Miss Camp-
bell, in cream silk with posies of pink roses and autumn
leaves. Melbourne honeymoon the bride going away in
navy-blue serge and blue hat trimmed with red birds.
On Bth inst. a Sydney vice-regal dinner-party occurred,

The dance given by Mr. and Mrs. Stephen, at Glenayi >
on ith inst., was another social success—floor, music and
partners being all that could he desired. Among the
guests were Mr. and Mrs. Consett Stephen, Captain and

Hon. Rupert Leigh, Miss Gowland, Miss Dight, Miss Cox,
Miss Manning, and dozens more.
Dr. Garrett’s dinner-party to the chief officers and

the intercolonial offices, was followed by an “at home,”
held by Mrs. Garrett, who wore a charming dress in ivory
satin embroidered in gold, held at the waist by a gold
tinsel girdle. Music was the principal attraction, and the
floral decorations were greatly admired.

Treasurer M’Millan’s recent Sydney
meeting was so “hot’’that a Sydney University
professor after ten minutes on the platform
thought it prudent to beat a hasty retreat. The
students will now have to look to their laurels, and
read up such standard works as “M’Millan before
his Constituents” and “ Haynes on the green
rosette. ”
Walter Edmunds’ pictured prophecy of
“ Labor gnawing the scalp of Capital in a bloody
revolution ”is hideously funny. Walter might
have added that the baldness of the scalp ensured
pleasant gnawing ; and The Bulletin proposes
to add to the prospect the additional diversion of
Labor gnawing off the horse-hair artificial
scalps of the “Devil’s Brigade,” of which Mr.
Edmunds, M.L.A., is such a distinguished
ornament.
Edmund Barton’s platform reply to G. H.
Reid’s recent political performance discharged at
least one shaft that fairly got home—viz., that
Reid in Parliament had always either postponed,
evaded, or opposed the principle of one-man-one
vote. And, by the way, didn’t Reid make him-
self obtrusively prominent at the policy-declaring
meeting of the N.S. W. Freetrade League at which
the one-man-one-vote principle was shunted ?
“An old man named Henry Hunter was
committed for trial at Adelaide Police Court to-
day for indecently .... Since 1878 Hunter
has been convicted four times for the same
offence, receiving on each of the last three occa-
sions two years’ imprisonment, and from 20 to 30
lashes.” There, now, is an object-lesson on the
brutality and uselessness of the Anglo-Saxon
system of flogging incurable idiots and maniacs.

A committe of Sydney clergymen has been
formed to establish “Parents’ Unions” for the
purpose of awakening fathers and mothers to a
sense of their parental obligations and to assist in
the discharge thereof. Poor clergy!—as usual,
utterly devoid of humour. What about the parsons’
own sons ? At least 20 per cent of them are in
gaol—or deserve to be. And as to parsons’
daughters—how often have we heard it (in the
police-court and elsewhere) “My father was a
clergyman.” What would the novelists do with-
out the betrayed rector’s daughter?
When the Rockhampton jury, who tried
the alleged riotous shearers, could not agree,
Judge Harding blandly asked the Crown Prose-
cutor : “How long will the Civil business take ? ”
“ Three days,” said Virgil Power. “ Then,” said
the Judge, turning to the Jury, “you will have
three days in which to consider the evidence.”
To men who had already been compulsorily kept
indoors for several days, this intimation from His
Honor amounted to direct and oppressive coercion,
for it was a threat, if the jury did not agree at
once, they would be locked up for three days.
Some judges have a passion for locking up people.
We have heard of a Southern judge who locked
up his daughter for a week so that she should
not by any chance communicate with a lover of
whom he disapproved. Had that judge been
brought before a magistrate for cruelty he would
have cut a sorry figure. We iiave heard of another
judge who threatened to “commit” a man “for
40 years” for “contempt.”

advocacy to which l am mainly indebted for my tardy
redemption from a cruel and unjust imprisonment.

The sharp practice resorted to, ivith the
best motives, no doubt, to save Johnston, of Bal-
larat, from the gallows, hardened the conscience
of society at large, and caused the. merely half-
hearted opponents of wholesale neck-breaking to
become for the moment singularly oblivious of the
real point at issue. T T p to the moment when it
was learned that a respite had been obtained for
Johnston on a false.hypothesis, he was the most
pitied man in Victoria, and petitions for
his reprieve poured in wholesale. Then the whole
shallow stream of sympathy suddenly dried up and
he was allowed to go to his doom amid-a grim
silence. The law in its death-penalty conmction
may be stupid enough, but i f s very stupidity
seems to appeal for support if any suspicion of
hoodwinking gets abroad. The circumstances
under which Johnston destroyed the wife ami
family he loved were in no wise affected by the
fact that he malingered in the ho pital and gaol
before and after his trial. But because he wasn't,
for unsubstantial reasons, slain bn the date
originally fixed, the public “threw Johnston
over” to the Executive, and almost approved of
the preposterous sentence that was carried out one
week later. In their virtuous indignation against
the doctors who overstated his mental and bodily
weakness in prison, the fickle crowd lost sight of
the fact that Johnston was as mad as a. hatter
when he made himself a childless widower, and
had never deserved to be hanged, anyway. They
forgot everything save that their cast-off protege
had malingered, and they unwittingly accepted
malingering as a very, very capital offence.
The forty-sixth annual report of the IS ew
York Life Insurance Company appears in
another column. Looking at the figures in detail
we find—Total assets, on 1st January, 1891,
£23,857,574 Is. 4d. ; surplus, £3,065,524 17s. 5d.;
income during last year, £6,616,893 Os. 5d. ; new
policies issued during 1890, 45,754, with insurance
of £32,834,581. The total amount of insurance in
force on 1st January, 1891, was £117,147,886,
through the investment of over 173,000 policy-
holders. This Company paid away over two and
a half millions sterling to policy-holders last
year, and it has accumulated assets since its in-
ception at the average rate of over four hundred
thousand pounds per year, but its present rate of
increase is over two millions. The New York
Life has been in business 46 years, and issues a
greater variety of policies than any other com-
pany, by adapting its contracts to all classes and
conditions. It§ endowment and annuity business
is greater than any other company in the world.
It originated and introduced the first non-
forfeiting policy in 1860, and all its policies, as
now issued, contain non-forfeiture provisions, and
are notably free from restrictions as to occupation,
residence and travel, and are incontestible after
two years, except in case of fraud, and are issued,
if desired, with mortuary-dividend features,
under which an amount equal to one-half on all
premiums paid is returned in addition to the
amount of the policy, in the event of death
during a specified period. This Company for 35
years was the only Company to omit the clause
making policies void in case of suicide. All its
profits belong to its policy-holders. It is domi-
ciled in Australia, pays all claims at the nearest
branch office, and is in every respect within the
jurisdiction of the colonial Courts.*

The Queensland Milling 1 Company.
Among the many imposing structures in Brisbane
is the Queensland Milling Co.’s new Flour Milh
situate in Albert-street, where the justly-cele-
brated “Snowdrop” Flour and Wheat-meal are
manufactured. The building is a substantial one
of brick, with 60ft. of frontage, 50ft. in depth, and
five storeys in height, its face artistically finished
in red and white brick and tuck pointed. The
mill is completely fitted throughout with the !
modern system of steel
rollers and is capable of
producing flour at the
rate of 15 bags per hour.
The wheat cleaning and
silk-dressing machinery,
also of the latest design,
was selected by Mr.
Hayes, the managing
director, as the most
efficient to be procured of
its kind. Attached are
two large brick wheat-
elevators or silos, each
capable of containing
about 30,000 bushels of
wheat, besides a granary
in the rear of the build-
ing for storing sacks, of
double that capacity.
Motive power is supplied
by E. P. Allis & Co.’s
Corliss valve-engines of
150 h.p. The building
throughout is provided
with the electric-light,
so as to avoid naked
lights, considered risky
and objectionable by the
Insurance companies.
The mill commenced
operations about the
middle of March, 1890,
and since then has been
running almost night
and day ; the demand
for the “ Snowdrop ”
Flour having exceeded
the anticipations of the
proprietors. Mr. Chas.
E. Hayes, well-known in Queensland and the neigh-
bouring colonies as one of the most successful, and
experienced millers, is principal proprietor and
managing director, and is determined to sustain
his reputation by operating only upon the best
materials with the best machinery and workmen.
This mill is the first established in Brisbane,
although the proprietary owned, until a month or
two ago, the largest flour mill in Warwick. Owing
to the high rates of railway freight, the Downs
mills have-hitherto been unable to touch the city
markets in competition with the flour from the
Southern colonies. It was to meet a growing
demand that the Queensland Milling Co. estab-
lished their Brisbane mill, and the proprietors are
pleased to find that local flour is now only getting
the support it merits from consumers. It seems
only natural that with the high-class grain grown
in the more favoured districts of Queensland, and
the advantage of an unlimited supply of coal,
Queensland should eventually manufacture all the
flour required for internal consumption, and may
even eventually seek markets outside.
Says the Australasian :
An amusing instance of the manner in which Taylor
(the imprisoned shearers’ delegate) poses when brought
before the public was afforded in the case of Feenix.
When this man was brought in from the station to give
his evidence, Taylor saw him at the watchhouse and
denounced him with the full power of his limited but
forcible vocabulary. Shortly, afterwards, when Feenix
was giving evidence in wet garments, shivering with the
cold, Taylor asked the magistrate to allow a spare shirt
of his (Taylor’s) to be given to the man, as he could not
to see him in such a forlorn condition.

The Court Journal says that Gladstone
dines out regularly; that he eats what comes,
generally right through the menu, and can take
a glass of port after his libation of champagne, a
test from which many an ardent diner-out would
shrink. His mental activity is on a par with his
physical vigour. His conversation is a never-
flagging flood, brimful of interest. If it were
only possible to reproduce a verbatim report of his
conversation at a dinner-party, where the personal
surroundings are sufficiently interesting to excite
him to talk, there would be produced a volume of
interest, biographical, autobiographical, and
historical. His memory is marvellous, and his
power of graphically recalling an incident is the
admiration even of the waiters.

The following circular has been issued by
the Central Branch of the Irish National League:
IRISH NATIONAL LEAGUE.
Kidman’s Buildings,
George and Market Streets,
Sydney, Ist May, 1891.
Sir,—We have the honour to inform you that at a
General Meeting of the Central Branch of the Irish
National League of New South Wales, the following
resolution was adopted:—
“That this meeting is of opinion that the policy of
neutrality in regard to the Leadership of the Irish
Parliamentary Party already decided upon should
be maintained, and that a Convention of the Irish
National League be held in Sydney to appoint Dele-
gates to raise funds for the Evicted Tenants.”
And that the Executive Committee, in order to give
effect to this resolution, has arranged for a Convention to
be held at 11 a.m. on TUESDAY, 26th May, at the Irish
National League Rooms, Kidman’s Buildings, Sydney.
It is considered that the just claims of the Evicted
Tenants to receive assistance from their countrymen in
New South Wales may be successfully urged without in
any way entering upon the question of the Leadership of
the Irish Parliamentary Party. We have therefore the
honour to request that you will have a Meeting of your
Local Committee called to nominate two Delegates to re
present your town and district at the proposed Convention-
An early intimation to the undersigned of the names of
the delegates chosen is requested. Should it not be con-
venient to send delegates from your district, your Com-
mittee will no doubt co-operate by canvassing for sub-
scriptions, which, when received, will be remitted to the
Treasurers of the Mansion House Committee, Dublin,
which consists of representatives of both sections of the
Irish Parliamentary Party.

Pledgee or Honor.
Be it Ijnown tP[Ot for the purpose of obtaining from, Dr. A. Wilford Hall the knowledge of his
hygienic discovery, and for his treatment of health and longevity, with the pamphlet unfolding the same,
I hereby pledge my word and honor not to show the pamphlet nor reveal its contents to anyone, nor allow
it to be seen by any person ; nor will I use the treatment with any others except the members of my own
family, from each of whom a promise shall be exacted not to reveal the treatment to others.
This pledge does not debar the physician who may purchase the pamphlet from using the
treatment with his patients, provided, however, he does not show the pamphlet nor reveal to them the
rationale of the treatment.

who will forward the Pamphlet by return mail.
"I We would respectfully refer as to our reliability to the Editor of this paper. f
The following testimonials from ministers, doctors, and private persons speak for them-
selves and they are but a drop in the bucket of the thousands received :
The distinguished pulpit-orator and evangelist,
Rev. Miles Grant, Boston, Mass., writes,
October 7:
“ ** s Touching your wonderful discovery, I take much
pleasure in saying, I am delighted with its effects upon
my system. I sent for it that I might know its influence
on a healthy person. I have now used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life. The treatment produces a general refreshing, in-
vigorating effect; sharpens my appetite, sweetens rfty
sleep, and makes me feel as though I had a new lease of
life. I have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
I have heard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, ‘ I would not
take $5O for it. It knocks the bottom out of disease.’ I
can say for myself I never spent cash to better advantage
than when I bought your pamphlet.—Your brother in
Christ, Miles Grant.”
Br. J. W. Graves, Parsons, Kansas, writes ;
“Dear Dr. _ Hall, —After a careful reading of your
pamphlet, which came to hand a few weeks ago, I became
so delighted with the far-reaching effects of its marvellous
physiological revelations, that I at once ordered Six of my
patients, who were suffering with consumption, to com-
mence the use of the treatment. lam happy to say that
they are all improving and doing well. You'have done a
great work for afflicted humanity.—Your fraternal friend,
J. W. Graves, M.D.”
Rev. Thos. Nield, Livonia, Incl., writes ;
“ At the time I received your pamphlet on Health and
Longevity, I was suffering from internal piles. After
putting your treatment into practice three times I bade
my trouble good-bye, and have not felt it since. I have
only to add, from practical experience, during the short
time I have owned your pamphlet, that I have more faith
in your system of treatment than in all the medicines of
all the doctors on earth combined.—Yours very truly,
I nos. Nikld.”
Rev. A. L. Cole, D.D.. M.D., Santa Ana, Cal.,
sends his second endorsement of the new pam-
phlet after another month’s practice of the treat-
ment, as follows:
“ Dear Dr. Hall, — I have nothing to take back from
my letter as printed in the July ‘Microcosm.’ Your
treatment is the first expression of the science of thera-
peutics I have ever seen in print, or have ever put
into practice that appeals to my judgment as unquali-
fiedly rational. It goes directly to the cause of all forms
of disease and removes it by aiding and abetting nature,
rather than provoking a conflict among the vital powers
as in the case of drug-medication. This 1 call genuine
remedial science. For nearly twenty-five years I have
been a consecutively tormented invalid, and I can say in
all candour and truth that the first real freedom from suf-
fering that I have experienced in all this time has been
since adopting your treatment. I rejoice beyond words
within my power of expression ; and I honestly believe
that under God you have done more in that pamphlet
than all the doctors of the world for the relief of suffering
humanity. The treatment in my own case is to me the
wonder of wonders ! The $4 I paid for the pamphlet was
the best spent money of mywhole life. You are at liberty
to print this, which I declare to be the literal truth upon
the honour of a man and a Christian. God bless you in
your beneficent work.” A. L. Cole.
Rev. Geo, Cook, of Milliean, Texas, who was
struck with what the doctors supposed to be a
fatal paralytic shock, now sends his seventh order
for pamphlets, and writes :
“Dear Friend, Dr. Hall, —Inclosed find the money for
three more pamphlets with pledges signed. My health is
now quite restored. Others here who have sent for the
pamphlet are just beginning to try the treatment, and
all are pleased with it. I will report further soon, and
send for a number of pamphlets.—Yours truly, George
Cook.”
Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
hind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs- —not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her 'work unimpeded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a “Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be maintained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Dr. J. M. Peebles, whose Sanitorium, as the
centre of his enormous medical practice, is at
Hammonton, N. J., and who admittedly is one of
the most learned physicians and surgeons now
living, has sent for our pamphlet and has received
it as a physiological revelation. He writes ;
“ Your health pamphlet dropped in upon me like a
healing ray of sunshine. I read it with avidity, and at
once put your treatment into practice, and it is scarcely
necessary to say I found it all you recommended it to be
and more. It is not only pathological, physiological, and
hygienic, but rational. Already have i derived great
personal benefit from your discovery.—Truly yours, J.
M. Pebbles, M.D.”
[Dr. Peebles is a graduate of several medical colleges>
has circumnavigated the earth three times in the interests
of therapeutical and pathological science, and is the
author of eleven volumes on the subject, the last being
“How to Live a Century and Grow Old Gracefully”—a
work which we have read with profound interest. The
indorsement of our pamphlet and treatment by such a
distinguished authority surely needs no comment.]
Rev. M. Fernsler, Sehatferstown, Pa., writes :
“Dr. A. W ilford Hall. Dear Sir, — Since receiving
your pamphlet I have carefully tested your treatment
upon myself. For more than twenty years I have been a
sufferer. My trouble has been torpid liver, indigestion,
pain across the kidneys, at times dizziness, with
occasional heart trouble, &c. With gladness unspeakable
I assure you I already find myself almost a new man ; and
I can never pay the debt of gratitude I owe you for the
blessing you have conferred upon me. I want to help
spread the knowledge of this discovery, and if you will
send me some blank Pledges of Honor I will let my
afflicted neighbours know about the great remedy that is
in store for them.—Yours very truly, M. Fkrnslzr.”
DR. R. F. STEVENS’ INDORSEMENT.
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment —
more than 20 years ago. In writing to a friend,
about a year ago, he gives the following :
***** “Nearly twenty years ago in this city Dr. A.
Wilford Hall gave ine privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered and adopted some
twenty years before, and which he had practised con-
tinuously upon himself up to that time. The history
included an account of the failure of the health, the
reasonings and conclusions which led him to adopt the
treatment, his rapid restoration to health, &c. From the
time of his first mention of it to me I have been entirely
satisfied that it saved him from a lingering consumption
and death ; and that in the years following, as I have evi-
dence to satisfy me, its continued practice has so affected
the nutrient and eliminating functions as to give to his
physical structure a greater degree of solidity, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. I learn that he has persistently
continued the treatment to the present time—forty years
in all—and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the * bloom of youth,’
though he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in my prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due to him for
whatever scientific advances he may be able to unfold in
the line of assisting nature to ward off disease, and in th*
restoration of health.—R. P. Stevens, M.D.”
Rev. M. A. Smith, pastor M.E. Church, South,
at McAlester, Ind. Ter., writes :
“ Inclosed please find signed pledge of Rev. W. H.
Hicks, bur Congregational minister, and the money for
his pamphlet. * * * I am not a bit surprised to see in
the June ‘ Microcosm ’ the wonderful things your new
discovery is accomplishing for those who have tried the
treatment. I want to tell you with tears of joy what it
has done for my wife. For about a year she has been
regarded as a hopeless consumptive. Our physicians had
given her up as incurable. She had patiently and reso-
lutely tried all sorts of medicines recommended by
different friends, when your pamphlet arrived. She at
once read it with me, and we became fully convinced as
to the soundness of your reasoning. Without loss of time
she proceeded to adopt your remedy, and now what words
can I employ to express our happiness over the result ?
* * * She commenced to improve in strength and flesh
immediately, and so marvellous has been the change that
she now weighs as much as ever she did ! Praise God,
and thanks to you, Dr. Hall. The dark cloud has been
lifted from our sky.—Your grateful friend, M. A. Smith.
Alison 0. Roe, Esq., Buchanan, Mich., writes:
“ Dear Dr. Hall,—l have received and read your won-
derful pamphlet on health and longevity. I am very
thankful that I was somewhat acquainted with you*
writings, having read the‘Problem of Human Life’ and
some numbers of the earlier volumes of the ‘ Microcosm.'
Had I not known of you through your- previous dis-
coveries in science I fear I should have given little atten-
tion to this great and priceless physiological discovery
which is destined to do so much for suffering humanity.
You will hear from me again soon.—Respectfully yours,
Alison C. Roe.”

A Reverie.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Tick, tick, tick, how loud you’re sounding,
Good old watch, with measured beat !
Long you’ve marked the fleeting seconds
Of Time’s steady, sure retreat.
You have had your times of sickness,
When your wheels would not go round.
Not your fault! —my clumsy fingers
Had your mainspring overwound—
Yes ! with you the idle moments
Have been few and far between ;
How I wish that my own record,
When made up, would show as clean !
You are old, but steady living
Brings with age its own reward,
Better far, old friend, if, like you,
I’d been always on my guard.
Watches seem a bit like horses:
Some for racing are inclined,
Others always, like slow coaches,
Falling more and more behind.
Outside some are eighteen-carat,
Stylish finish on the case ;
Good looks do not make a goer—
Shining coat’s no proof of pace—
You are just a common silver
With a plain enamelled dial,
But for years you’ve proved a stayer,
Up to time on every trial.
Well I mind the day I bought you
Cheap—your fashion’s out of date—
Just the day ray old black “ Bessie ”
Won the Main Camp maiden plate.
That night wasn’t there a shindy !
Yes, I do remember now.
You did all you could to make me
Clear out long before the row.
Told me that my darling Bessie,
Not the mare this time—the Miss—
Down beside the sleepy river,
Waited for a parting kiss.
Confound you ! stop that ceaseless ticking,
Let these stale old tales alone 1
Making me quite sentimental
Over days that long are gone.
Time will see both you and me out,
Though he’s passing fast away ;
Yours is not perpetual motion —
Worn out you’ll be, too, some day—
Tick, tick, tick, come, take it easy ;
Stop'your yarns, they’ll surely keep.
Now my pipe is only ashes,
Better let a fellow sleep !
BLUEGUM.
Success.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In this world of worn-out romance, neither trusting facts
nor dreams.
We do well to learn there’s nothing in the anything that
seems.
Hope fulfilled is hardly better than the pangs of hope
deferred ;
Disillusion mocks fruition ; aims, if reached, but prove
absurd.
Even Love is no exception. Test it—and it brings a
pain
Gnawing all the while the loving, bitter when the love is
slain.
What poor devil fails to suffer as he sighs—“ My dear,
with me
Love is fierce as starving tigers, tender, too, as dreams of
thee! ”
But, as tigers starved grow savage, so the love that’s love
denied
Either wounds and tears, or burns out, cold as hearths
whose flames have died.
Oft the love with aims accomplished soon abates its
former force.
For the love that’s once made legal quick would fain
achieve divorce.
For with marriage comes the bitter—when you bore each
other so,
That you wish you’d both been jilted iathatgnawinHono-
ago.
Then one sees—that having gained love—he has lost
whole heaps of fun,
And both spend their days regretting that their hearts’
choice hath been won.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
For you, my lord, the millions toil, for you the spinners
spin ;
For you the workers delve and sweat, for you their
daughters sin.
For you, my lord, the mother leaves her own to waste
and pine.
That yours may live to feast and fat and drink the mellow
wine.
For you the sculptor hews the stone, for you the anvil
rings ;
For you the artificer shapes a thousand lovely things.
For you the fruitful earth is tilled, for you the seed is
sown ;
For you the fruit is ripened, and for you the grain is
grown.
For you the herdsman tends the flock, for you the fleece
is spun ;
And from the heart of Mother Earth for you the, ore is
wrung.
Before your gold both young and old bow down and bend
the knee,
Whilst you alone, ’mid sigh and groan, stand fetterless
and free.
For you, my lord, the toiler leaves his broken-hearted
wife
That yours may live, in careless ease, a wasted, useless
life.
To you the poet brings his lays, for you the author
strives
To please your sickly vanity, or gratify your wives’—
’Tis you the painter tries to please, at you the singer
sings ;
For you the harpist softly tunes the sweet, pathetic-
strings.
For you the specious lawyer pleads, for you the cables he •
For you the millions toil and fight, for you the millions
die.
At your request the helot’s breast is bared to meet the
steel,
And War and Fire, at your desire, go forth for woe or
weal.
By you, my lord, the laws are made, by you the scales are
strung ;
By you is virtue sent to gaol, by you the thief is hung.
By you, O lord, the acts are made, by you the acts re-
pealed ;
By you the deed is framed and writ, bv you the deed is
sealed.
For you, in fine, the earth was made, and yours are all
the lands,
And sacrilege indeed ! it were for you to soil your hands ;
And doubtless, too, for you alone the suns and planets
roll—
The Lord above, the Lord of love, no doubt will save your
soul;
Or if you should by any chance (depart from ways of
grace
The king below will keep in hell for you a special place.
Oh, potent lord 1 oh, mighty lord I oh, lord of earth and
sky!
When shall your power and presence fade, when shall
your kingdom die ?
When the earth is rent and shaken.
When the sons of men awaken.
When the souls of men are strong ;
When the hearts of men are true,
When the death of olden wrong
Ushers in the golden new.

Ihe latest dog-story comes from Gympie.
Tozer is the member for Gympie, and the miners
have christened their mangiest curs after him.
Dog Tozer will have a bad time of it when he
goes up for re-election.
Tlie craze for setting up stone figures-
intended to represent all sorts of dead persons
still rages in Ballarat. The Courier says in a
late issue-:—“ The desirability of awakening the
public interest to the propriety of erecting statues
for (sic) Shakespeare and Captain Cook was
referred to at the meeting of the Council yester-
(Dy fiy Councillor Thompson, who stated that
there are any number of people in Ballarat willing
to erect the statues.” “ Propriety ”is exquisite
as used here. The people of Ballarat seem to
think that they ought to erect statues to Shake-
speare and Captain Cook more as a matter of duty
than as a pleasure to themselves. We see how it
will end. Their descendants, in the days when
the Eureka Stockade will be regarded as an
astronomical allegory and Peter Lalor will take
rank with William Tell as a form of the solar
myth, -will believe—and boast about it—that both
Shakespeare and Captain Cook were born on Bal-
larat in the old digging days. The next pair of
statues to be set up will probably (to keep up the
charming incongruity of the series) be those ©f
Homer and Buckley, the wild white man.
Dear Bulletin, —Apropos to Charlie
Bast lake, of humorous memory, referred to by
you in a recent issue. He used at times to officiate
as what he called “honorary dissector” at the
dining-table of the Royal Hotel, Maryboro’ (Q.),
where he spent his shore-going time after an island
cruise. He had to keep supplied once a very gross-
feeding minister of religion, who “socked ” the
ham most ferociously, and asked for “a little piece
off the knuckle” for the third or fourth time. "1
understand your preference for that part, reverend
Sir, said Charles, airily, l> the nearer the bone the
farther from God.” Another clergyman, an
equally gross feeder (theßiverine hotel-keepers will
never forget him), used to annoy Charlie by send-
mg up his plate three or four times, especially when
there was sucking-pig. Once a fresh sucker had
just come in, at his third time of asking; its lemon-
filled mouth hung over the ashet’s edge at one end
and its curly tail touched the diaper at the
other.- He was a fine bird. Charlie gave the
lean, gaunt shepherd one questioning look, then
chopped the slaughtered innocent in twain across
the loins, popped the head, shoulders, fore-feet,
and ribs, with a mound of stuffing, intact, on the
sanctified glutton’s plate and set it down without
a grin. But one other face at the table wore no
smde. It was the parson’s, he hadn’t time to
beam. He had a big contract on hand but he got
right through with it. Charlie was licked. Per-
haps someone remembers the countess who used
i’?/-] 36 ' 3U^er i n , petticoats at the above hostelry.
Countess,” said Eastlake, one. day, “ ask your
chef not to send the poultry to the table with their
feet in their trousers’ pocket—” and he pointed to
the roosters that were before him, which were
trussed in that style so dear to second-rate cooks
and so damnable to third-rate carvers. Charlie
was as popular among the kanakas as the whites.
“ Massa Isslake ” was the usual salutation he re-
ceived from black and white,-

MERELY THE TRUTH.
They have merit.
The fact is indisputable.
The proof lies in the free samples.
It is not enough to say they sometimes fail.
They are of human produce, and therefore fallible.
The real facts are—
Do they cure diseases of the blood and skin in the majority of in-
stances? Undoubtedly they do.
Do they undo the effect of a chill or congestion, by bringing about
normal conditions of health ? Yes, they loosen arid disperse the congestion.
Do they permeate the blood aseptically, so that bacilli and gcsans
cannot multiply and the growth of disease is checked ? Yes, they do.
Do they confer relief, assuage pain, and benefit the general health,
even when they do not cure ? Invariably, yes.
Do they act as a natural healthy laxative, rendei’ing them especially
valuable to women and children, and to men of sedentary habits of life or
business ? Yes, by tonic action only.
Do they free the inner skin pores and intricacies from taint, clearing
off eruptions and improving the complexion ? They do.
Does their palatable taste and safety render them pre-eminently a
family medicine ? Yes, for neither the mind nor stomach rebels against
them, and children like them.
Are they the best of all blood purifiers and the most valuable of all
spring cleansing medicines 1 Yes, they are.

A Big Business
Built Up
On Free Samples
The sales of Frazers Sulphur Tablets
afford the most convincing proof of their
merits, taken in conjunction with the methods
by which the sale has been built up.

who has written or applied for free samples of
Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets has been supplied
gratis and post free. Many tens of thousands
of persons have so applied, in accordance with

merit, must be attributed the success or failure
of the sales.
Have the sales grown ?
Let the facts speak for themselves —
The sale for the year ending January 9,
1890, was 81,760 packets, proved by the pur-
chase of that number of Revenue Stamps,
The sale for the year ending January 9,
1891, was 412,000 packets, proved also by the

W3t Write for samples of FRAZER'S SULPHUR TABLETS, mentioning the Sydney Bulletin, and they will be sent you gratis and post
free, Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets are the pleasantest and most efficacious medicine for all Blood and Skin Diseases and Eruptions, as also for Con-
stipation and Rheumatism. They are invaluable for the complexion, as they free the pores of the skin from all obstructive and tainted matters.
They are positively safe for men, women and children : for the young and the aged, and for the weak as well as the strong. They are a valuable
preventive medicine. They are a Blood Germicide, iA, destructive of disease germs in the blood. They therefore fend against Scarlet and Typhoid
Fevers, Smallpox, and all infectious complaints. They are eminently suitable for children’s ailments, and are much liked by the little ones. As a
safe and purifying remedy, as a clearer and beautitier of the complexion, FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS have no equal, while their palliative
properties in Rheumatism, Gout, Ac., render them a most desirable remedy always to have in the house. They are pleasant to the taste, agreeable

The Lesson of the Sparrow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Along my garden-path hops up and down
A saucy sparrow in a suit of brown.
And turns upon me, as he passes by,
A bright, quick-moving, supercilious eye.
For hours past I have sat here, wrestling with
Dark problems, such as —“ Is the World a
ibyth ? ”
Oiv’n fifty creeds to find ’ the one that’s
• right ”
And “ What is Man’s place in the Infinite 1 ”
But little knows that careless bird about
The travailings of philosophic doubt,
The trouble of a choice ’twixt fifty creeds:
His thoughts are all on grubs, and worms, and
seeds. '
The riddle of the painful earth to him
Is naught. He has no yearnings vague and dim.
"Tis pitiful to see—and yet absurd—
The ignorance of that wretched little bird.
And yet, no doubt, he’ll fly back to his nest
_ And to his mate remark in scornful jest,
“ I saw a creature huge, but small of beak—
(Which gave his visage an expression weak)
“ He was not hunting insects in the weeds,
He was not seeking grubs, or worms, or seeds,
But sat for hours, unmoving as a tree : .
How he lives is a mystery to me.”
O, sparrow,, each of us a lesson needs !
/ will go hunt for grubs, and worms, and seeds
Henceforth, and leave Philosophy divine
Tothose whose verse brings eighteehpence a line.
V.J.D.
“And now, brethren,” said a departing
Adelaide parson, the other week, “I commend
you to the care of the Almighty God until I
return. ” So alleges a local paper.
If asked to drink, call for Wolfe’s Schnapps.
A Victorian squatter obtained a magnifi-
cent merino ram, but it bolted with one of the
ewes, and the pair were not seen for six weeks,
the result being that the use of the ram was lost
for the entire season, a Balzackian and Zolaistic
observer started moralising on the philosophy of
marriage, for the ram without doubt got mashed
on that merino—it was a clear case of love at first
sight. The owner wanted him to be a Brigham
Young, but he insisted on monogamy. This case
ot “the pure merino” is well authenticated, and
is mentioned in J. R. Graham’s well-known
“ Treatise on the Australian Merino.”
A Victorian youth, aged eight years, is in
serious trouble. He assaulted another boy of his
own size in the street and took half-a-sovereign
from him, and with the proceeds of this sinful
action, he took his best girl, aged seven, out for
the day. Having filled the wretched maiden up
to the top of her head with three shillings-worth
of bananas and ginger beer, he deserted her in the
street, and “ blewed ” the other 7s. on marbles.
The girl got home somehow, and was found three
parts dead on the kitchen floor, of indigestion,
and being violently shaken up she told her story
of sin and misery. Then a search expedition
went out after the male criminal, and found him
with his back nearly broken through trying to
hump the marbles home, and ran him in. There
seems to be material for Parkes to make a poem
on this incident, especially if the offender is a
“beautiful orphan.”
A Sydney Sunday paper, in a late issue,
published a virulent attack on the late Charles
Bradlaugh, and concerning this attack The Bul-
letin has received several communications. We
have no respect for the maxim which says: “ Speak
nothing but good of the dead,V but we have the
utmost contempt for those who take advantage of
a man’s death to say that which could not safely
be circulated during his lifetime. For our con-
temporary’s mud-spatter is shovelled from a heap
of refuse collected by one Mackay, shrewdly sus-
pected of being the tool of “ Saladin,” Bradlaugh’s
bitterest and most unscrupulous foe. Now,
Maekay’s publishers were heavily fined for pub-
lishing the volume from which Truth quotes
(as were several newspapers who gave publi-
city to its statements) and ordered to de-
stroy every copy of a book proved by
abundant evidence to be untrue in general
and in particular. That several copies have found
their way to Australia is due to the fact that the
beggared journalistic jackal who fictionised the
matter, is sustaining a beer-sodden existence in
London by retailing copies to those owners of
half-crowns whom chance throws in his way.
Bradlaugh’s daughter, Hypatia, recently proved
that little credence could be attached to the state-
ment made by Bradlaugh, the sectarian, that his
brother had been guilty of unfilial conduct,
because he (the orthodoxist) was only seven years
old when the elder Bradlaugh died.
In sleepy Western Australia it is the
custom to import from England supplies of
domestic servants specially selected “at home ”
for the Australian market. Recently a ship-load
of these highly-conditioned “slaveys” arrived at
Perth, and the usual scramble (like those which
used to occur in Sydney a few years ago under like
circumstances) took place in the allotment of suit-
able “places.” Prior to the arrival of the vessel,
Bridget’s interests had been warmly championed
by the local clergy, who prevailed on the immigra-
tion office to announce that the servants were for
private service only, and that no publicans,
sinners, or boarding-house-keepers need apply.
The girls on arrival were safely housed under the
superintendence of the parsons and a committee
of tract-distributing ladies and devotional exer-
cises were regularly indulged in until the
emigrants were drafted off into the families
of the various heads of departments and
other meritorious civil servants. A few
days after the distribution, one of the un-
suspicious “slaveys,” Hot being used to “hard
graft’’froms a.m. until midnight, ventured to
remonstrate with her cultured mistress, but the
result was that in sheer desperation the girl
absconded. She was promptly brought up under
the Masters’ and Servants’ Act—which makes a
breach of contract on the servant’s part a penal
offence—and, despite her plea that she was physi-
cally incapable of doing the work, she was fined £4
or one month in gaol. However, the unfortunate
and friendless emigrant was not allowed to go to
prison vile, for the amount of the extortionate fine
was subscribed by several disinterested persons—
not by the clergy or tract committee.
The old Melbourne Police Court is finally
closed, previous to re-building, and away go a
host of associations with Sturt, Call, Panton, and
all the rest. Likewise Albert Read, Frank
Stephen, and the attorneys. Also Tommy the
Nut, Lord Beerthirst, and all that kidney, with
the old D.’s and Days.
In South Australia the State sets apart £5O
for the defence of every prisoner accused of
murder. This ensures accused being able to
engage one of the seniors of the bar, and not
having to depend on some obscure junior, as in
other provinces. Gordon, M.P., is right: South
Australia is ahead in democracy. We last week
read in a Melbourne paper :—“ In a recent Vic-
torian capital case the defence was shortened up
very considerably because the counsel and attorney
allotted the prisoner by the Crown were refused
refreshers. ”
Mr. Lee, S.M., means to exact £5 in
future from anyone who lets off fireworks in a
Sydney street. The next move should be to fine
everyone whose yapping dog rushes out at passing
horses.
An ex-trooper tells a characteristic story
of old Jack Robertson. While Jack was N.SW.
Colonial Secretary he was on an official visit up
country, this particular trooper being detailed as
an escort. Hearing a clanking sound behind, Sir
John looked round and discovered that the trooper
had the regulation sword on. Waiting till he
camQ up, he wanted to know what the &c. he had
that &c. toasting-fork on for. “Regulation, Sir
John.”_ “&c., &e. the regulations! leave the
thing at the next pub. and tell ’em I said so.”
At the next pub. it was left accordingly.
Colemane and Sons sugar-coated Euoalypte
Pills. Also, Eucalypte Lozenges. Try them.
The distance from the earth of the nearest
fixed star is such that were a child to despatch a
message from the earth to the nearest of the stars
he could not receive an answer back before he had
become an old man, even though the message
passed on its way to and fro with a speed so great
that it covered a distance of 25,000 miles between
every two ticks of a clock !
Cardinal Moran had a muffled peal rung
from St. Mary’s Cathedral as the funeral of Sir
John Robertson passed by. The R.C. church of
N.S.W. has reason to be pleased with the career
of old Jack. It was he, for instance, who conveyed
to it, for “ nix,” that large and peerless domain at
Manly on which his Eminence now so comfortably
squats. Moreover, as the Cardinal pointed out
in a late sermon, the old man always fought fairly,
and never attempted to raise a sectarian cry for
political purposes.
The popular liquor—Wolfe’s Schnapps.

With the object of showing the banefi 1
influence of trades-unionism, the daily papers
have recently pointed out that 25 per cent, of the
men at a certain Queensland saw-mill have been
dismissed because they refused to accept a reduc-
tion of wages. As a matter of fact they were
only receiving 6id. an hour, and the employers
wanted to cut it down to sjd.— less than a London
docker gets. It would be interesting to know
where, in the opinion of the daily press, trades-
unionism operates beneficially !
“THE BULLETIN."
(Published at SYNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“Tb.e Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dU
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prism
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politic*.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
[ than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter* which is not
qf general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
asu has become a vast property, because it pos.
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim chat every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
j first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
j name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
j letin continues the one phenomenal success in
j Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Gause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary, weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of 'the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Galvanic Battery
Is acknowledged by Eminent Physicians, and by-
thousands of sufferers to be a positive Remedy for
nearly all the ailments mankind is heir to. The effi-
cacy of this Wonderful Invention as. a curative agent
is certainly The Crowning Medical and Scien-
tific Triumph of the 19th Century.
This BATTERY is not larger than a half-crown
piece, and is worn on the chest, next the skin, suspen-
ded by a silk cord around the neck. The several
metals of which it is composed are so arranged that the
natural humidity of the skin is sufficient to set the chem-
icals in the amalgamated metals in motion, generating
8 constant but gentle flow of Electrioity which passes
from the Battery into the system, purifying the Blood,
strengthening the Nerves,ißrain and Muscles, infusing
fresh vigor into the Debilitated Constitution, Stimu-
lating the Vital Organs to their proper action and en-
abling nature to throw off numerous diseases.
The Battery will cure the following ailments:—
Headache, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Neuralgia, Ulcers,
and Tumors, Nervous Debility, Impotence, Liver Com-
plaints, Fever and Ague, Disease of the Kidneys and
Urinal Organs, Bronchitus, Asthma, Diphtheria, Fits,
Constipation, Piles, Heart Disease, Paralysis, Disease
of the Lungs and Throat, Skin Disorders, and almost
every form of Aches and Pains.
The Battery has a soothing effect upon children
while teething. Illustrated Circular sent free, giving
full particulars and directions for use,

SWOItX CERTIFICATE,' —One of Thousands more
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
Idth December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugblhann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, wan
taken ill about three years ago with a severe eold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine vhthout it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sura. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, One of Her Majesty’s
