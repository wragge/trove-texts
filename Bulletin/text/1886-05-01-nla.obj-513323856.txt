The Proposed Pauper Emigration to Aus-
tralia.
The Bulletin.
SATURDAY, MAY 1, 1886.
“ A well-considered system of state-di-
rected emigration ” appeared in November
last to the aristocratic and opulent, Lord
Brabazon to be the only means of ending
“ the fearful struggle for life which is to be
met with in the East and South of London,
and in most of the larger towns ” of Eng-
land. His luxurious lordship criticised then
the condition of the despairing paupers
with the same keen interest that a squatter
might feel in viewing the appearance of his
thirst-tortured and starving sheep. His
prophecy concerning the ttrrible dangers
and disasters certain to result from th©
continuance of this “fearful struggle for
life” is a plain deduction from known
premises and has already received a measure
of fulfilment in the London Bread-riot of
the 9th Feb., but the plan by which he pro-
poses to avert the danger is as inefficient in
its probable action as it would be cowardly
in its application. So feeble does his sug-
gested remedy appear that we did not con-
sider it worthy even of derision when it was
first offered as a panacea of pauperism, but
the subject having now attained almost the
central place in the public mind of England,
and adoption of the scheme being largely
urged, the problem and its solution have
become of active interest to the residents of
every part of the empire.
» * *
So far has the plan of Lord Brabazon
commended itself, that, as we learnt by cable
on the 26th March, Earl Granville has
written to the Agents-General of these
colonies asking how many immigrants
would be received in Australia, and how
much would be paid towards the expenses
of their passage. This project, so far as it
concerns the colonies, may be dealt with in a
few words. If the immigrants are to con-
sist of indolent atnd semi-criminal paupeis,
our answer is that we don’t desire and will
not have them. If, on the contrary, they
are industrious artizans the effect upon our
own workmen would be to reduce wages by
intensifying competition, and it is unreason-
able that workmen hero should be forced to
contribute to the expense of bringing out a
horde of mechanics to become their rivals
in the local labour markets, thus depreciat-
ing the rate of wages by increasing the sup-
ply of labour without enlarging the demand
Money thus paid for wholesale State-
directed and State-paid importations of
labour would be a gigantic subsidy to
capital. As concerns the colonies then this
scheme would be manifestly unjust, and un-
der no circumstances can we consider it as an
efficient means of relieving the distress and
benefiting England, unless indeed cargoes of
revolutionary loafers instead of the pro-
mised “skilled mechanics who are wot pau-
pers,” are induced to become exiles. If this
former objectionable class be prevented by
the colonial representatives from embark-
ing, and only skilled workmen who possess
some means be sent, England will lose many
of her most active producers of wealth.
Nor.oould this blood-letting from the veins
of industry do more than relieve the
distress for a very short time. The same
causes which produced the present result
will in the future have an effect, similar
in kind though greater in degree, un-
less very large reforms to which we
shall presently allude are inaugurated.
Ireland proves the correctness of our
assertion. No part of the world has, dur-
ing the last 50 years, supplied America and
Australia with more immigrants than has
Ireland, yet the present inhabitants are the
most indigent, discontented and trouble-
some subjects of the British Empire. There
is a cause for the discontent in Ireland as
there is for the pauperism in England. It is
not the symptoms of the national disease that
English statesmen should treat—-they must
prescribe for the disease itself. To attempt
to get rid of paupetism and distress by
banishing the present victims of a vicious
National system, is like trying to blanch the
nose of a toper while he still continues to
take an undiminished quantity of spirits.
If the English speakers and writers were to
inquire into the causes of the revolution-
breeding misery which now afflicts London
with almost unprecedented intensity, the
true remedy would be easily found. But
the aristocratic Brabazons and their Press
DR. JAMES EDWARD NEILD.
organs only turn their thoughts to these low
fellows because, as Imperial Federation
ingenuously says:—■
“ Such occurrences as were witnessed on the 9th
ult. In the metropolis, when some thousands of
unemployed men, after demonstrating by meet-
ings and speeches in Trafalgar-square, marched to
the West End, and proceeded to smash clubhouse
and shop windows, stop carriages in the middle of
the streets, and snatch jewellery from the persons
of their fair occupants, forcibly enter shops and
pillage them, and other similar outrages, compel
us to think on our social problems.”
It is the damage done to property and
the commission of similar outrages which
alone has power to rouse Dives to concern
himself about Lazarus, and th© result of
the enquiry is that it is an infernal nuisance
to havo such follows about the place—they
must be sent off somewhere before they do
any more mischief, and then may Dives
wallow in his wealth with an untroubled
mind. There is no work for Lazarus to do,
for Dives gets his luxuries and most of bis
necessaries from another land, so the gener-
ation of Lazarus must go to a far country
if they would earn an honest living. Dives
must buy in the cheapest market, though
they be foreign serfs or slaves who labour to
supply his wants. When another generation
like Lazarus knocks threateningly at the
door of the owner of millions, they must be
sent cut of the country too. Lazarus is
vulgar, the sores of poverty disfigure him.
He is a bad sort of fellow to have on the
premises. He must go away somewhere.
* * m
That is pretty nearly the situation of
affairs in England. While unemployed
millions are vainly seeking work, the Bel-
gian ironmasters are pouring thousands of
tons of steel rails into Ereetrade England,
and every port on the Continent is closed to
the British manufacturer. While cutlers
seeking work are wearing down the foot-
paths of Sheffield, America is underselling
England in the Home markets. Germany
supplies England with manufactured iron
and steel implements, France sends over
articles of luxury, America all kinds of mer-
chandise which labour is required to pro-
duce, and England remits her millions to
pay for these, while her own labouring
population is drifting into revolution be-
cause they cannot, by honest labour, obtain
the wherewithal to keep body and soul to-
gether. The Home tariff only affects the
working classes by increasing the cost of
each article of every-day consumption, so
that mechanics must obtain more for their
labour than would be necessary if the ports
were absolutely free ; but that same tariff
refuses to put English workmen on a level
with the ftreign artificers by adding to the
cost of the product the extra cost, by reason
of the tariff additions to the necessaries of
life, of producing it in England. It is"no
wonder ihat England’s manufacturing
supremacy under these circumstances
should be a tradition of the past, less than
a fact of the present or a hope of the future.
Nor is it strange when foreigners are enabled
to take the bread out of the mouths of Eng-
lishmen, that the latter should become
seditious, turbulent, and altogether appro-
priate subjects for wholesale banishment.
But there is an immeasurably greater evil
than this freetrade protection of foreigners
at work to produce misery to the turbulent
unemployed, and it is one whose agency
is immediately apparent. The reported
pauperism which makes it desirable to
banish thousands who are not able to earn
the crust necessary to sustain life, shows
that the “unequal distribution of the
national wealth ” is the outcome of the
present social system, and the pauperism
and distress of the many its necessary inci-
dent. Altnough it is deemed absolutely
necessary to cast out these paupers that
they may lind elsewhere the means of exist-
ence denied them in their native land, we
And that the rich suffer from no diminution
of capital or income. Her Gracious Majesty
still has hi r odd millions sunk in remunera-
tive London ground rents, and month by
month increases her hoarded treasure and
its yearly produce in spite of miserable
doles of £5OO to the Distress fund, and £lO to
the Home for (ye gods!) Lost Dogs: “Wales”
is still able to visit Monaco and back
horses at Epsom and Ascot: Alfred of
Edinburgh continues to view with avari-
cious eyes his easily got and tremblingly
guarded treasures: and gifts are yet made
to German loafers and royal “bummers’
who are too noble to yield any return for
the thousands which they draw from the
coffers of a long-suffering nation. Nor have
the nobles become less wealthy since the
pauper population became desperate, and,
consequently, seditious. Westminster,
Portland, Manchester, Argvlb, Buo-
cleoch, and other dukes, alleged nobles,
and millionaires, add thousand to thousand
by coining gold from the sweat of the
workers, Titled felons and aristocratic
blackguards are now able and willing as
ever to lodge extravagant retainers with
women of the Jefferies class : lisping lords
and wealthy young commoners can still
spend as much on a single bouquet for
some tight-rope Tottie as would keep an
East End family of 10 for six months: and
the army of prelates and parsons suffer
no diminution of incomes during life
and float away to the hereafter leav-
ing estates valued at from a quarter of
a million downwards. The misfortune of
the poor is the opportunity of tne rich. If
men are so reduced that they must take a
shilling a day or starve, “my lord” is
graciously willing to pay for that labour,
and obtain an immediate return of five
hundred per cent, on the investment. So
the extremes daily widen. Every man
added to the list of absolute paupers in-
creases the hoards of the millionaire. Every
capitalist who attains to the rank of a
millionaire leaves a line of starving poor to
mark his road to opulence. The situation
bears a strong resemblarc? to the “lambing-
down” system of lack-block shanties. The
shearer there gives in his cheque for which
a few drinks of poisoned grog are handed
to him. When the poison at length loses its
hold of his faculties he begins to grumble,
gets noisy, aucl is au eyesore to the place.


Ur J. £. Neild.
On the first page of this week's Bulletin appears
a portrait of Dr. James Edward Neild, whose name
is well known all over Australia as that of an
accomplished man of letters, and a no less able
authority on forensic medicine. Dr. Neild, has
assisted in many successful literary enterprises
and was one of the leading lights of Melbourne*
Punch in its palmy days. He has for years been
dramatic critic for the Australasian, was long
editor of the Victorian Medical Gazette, and
is still lecturer at the medical school of Melbourne
Uoiyersity. The doctor is generally credited with
the authorship of the “ Melbourne letters ” in the
Sydney Morning Herald, which are almost
universally regarded as the only Interesting con-
tributions to that ponderous journal.

Land monopoly is the chief cause of this
inequality of wealth. According to the
figures stated in the House of Commons by
Mr. Labouchbrb, and, so far as our files
show, unoontradioted by the party person-
ally interested, tho peers of England hold
an average of 35,000 acres apiece, and re-
ceive revenues averaging £30,000 annually.
When the laws enable men by the accident
of birth to monopolise such huge sections of
what was given for the common use
and benefit of all, it is evident that
poverty and distress must be the lot
of the masses who are thus deprived
of their inheritance. The stated area,
35,000 acres, would be a magnificent portion
in New South Wales, where the competition
for land, except in or near cities, towns, and
villages, is comparatively slight, but in
Great Britain, where the struggle for God’s
gift, the soil, is always intense, the appro-
priation of so much land-surface means
want, misery, and destitution to all those
who should be, but are not, joint-tenants of
the estate. Land monopoly is the germ
of the malady which now afflicts England ;
the unequal distribution of wealth its effect
upon the national system; and an army of
riotous paupers the offensive outward erup-
tion which marks the progress of the disease.
It is impossible to make any other diagnosis
of the case, yet British statesmanship, forced
to notice the symptoms, is blind to the
disease which works destruction internally,
and proposes to effect a permanent cure by
means of an outward application not even
designed to check the vicious agencies which
those symptoms indicate. There Is only one
ground upon which reasonable hope can
rest, and that is contained in the fact that
it is impossible that the real remedy can be
for ever withheld. If the rulers of the day
will not give it, the despised proletariat will
take it themselves. Already a London street
has been plundered in broad daylight. This
is but a trivial brush at the out-posts. The
main army is coming on, and if no parley is
made, the forces must meet. It may be that
wealth and dignity may triumph in the first
skirmishes, but such triumphs must be fol-
lowed by greater disasters. Concession is
the only wise course, and such concession
must be more than the gift of exile. The
mob demand bread: they will not widingly
accept banishment as its equivalent.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Gladstone and Hartington.
The English Premier has gone too far for his
lukewarm Lieutenant. The proposals for the
settlement of the Irish question have caused the
two to part. This is exactly what might have
been expected. It is not that Gladstone proposes
to concede too much to Ireland, but that he in-
tends that hereditary legislation shall not be part
of the Irish Constitution, and that the landlords
there shall be forced to sell their estates. The
Tories and Tory-Liberals know well that if peers
be not allowed to carry on their legislative bur-
lesque all excuse for the very existence of the
peerage will have departed. The abolition of the
peerage in Ireland must be a consequence of the
cessation of legislation by the peers as a separate
body. And Ireland has been already made the
subject of experimental reform. The Disestablish-
ment of the Church in Ireland showed the possi-
bility and wisdom of Disestablishing the Church
of England; and the satisfactory result of the
sale (on terms of payment by Instalments) of glebe-
lands to Irish peasants has paved the way for this
present proposal to sell to them on terms the acres
of their landlords. The peerage and the rights of
landlords in England are both distinctly menaced
by Gladstone s scheme of Home Rule. No
wonder then that Hartington, heir-apparent to a
Dukedom and rent-roll of £lBO,OOO a year, refuses
to walk further with his chief. And all who wish
to save the peerage will follow him. Then Eng-
land will know her enemies. Tho Liberals, as a
united body, no longer exist. Some have gone to the
Toxyism which at heart they always worshipped >
and others have become Radicals. The Irish pro-
posals will be discussed as though they concerned
Ireland alone, but the real question is as to the
abolition of the peerage, and the rights of land-
lords to deal with their estates, and to hold them
jn perpetuity.
Commercial Christianity.
The Sydney Morning Herald is nothing if not
pious, so she published a sermon on Good Friday.
It was a loading article, but a sermon all the
same. Like the member for Queanbeyan and his
prototype the Jaynil One, she commenced by scrap-
ing up some bits of history and mixing them to-
gether in a kind of hash. Then, after piling up
the agony and a lot of pious cant for more than
a column, the dear old lady winds up in this
fashion :
"The bulk of civilised mankind still believe that
Jesus Christ lived and died 1800 years ago, and
that His death is the grandest study and the
highest example ever fuinished to mankind.”
Quite so, but In spite of this belief, pious
“.Christian ” papers of the Herald persuasion,
written chiefly by men who seem to have found
that the service of the Lord doesn’t pay, continue
to keep men at work on Sunday nights so that the
issue may be out on Monday morning; and in spite
of the fact that the life of Jesus Christ is the
highest example ever furnished to mankind, the
absorbing desire of local plutocrats is that they
may rake in the riches which He condemned by
building houses for working-men on blocks, 16ft.
by 100 ft., and screwing as much rent as possible
out of the unfortunates who inhabit these
dog-kennels. The bulk of civilised mankind
still believe in Jesus Christ, but despite the fact
that the Herald periodically drivels columns of
cant, there is more misery in the world—in Sydney
—than there ever has been before, and tho rich
are more keen and reckless in grasping the inor-
dinate wealth which none have ever more sweep-
Ingly condemned than Cubist Himself. When we
see parsons continuing ,ln the Church, in spite of
offers of bigger screw elsewhere, and when the
avaricious rich share their goods with the poor,
then we shall have some faith in this general be-
lief in Christ on the part of “the bulk of civilised
mankind.” That belief appears to us but as a
badge of respectability, worn for the purpose of
enabling men more effectually to grab tne money
for which their little souls yearn with an insa-
tiable desire. Christ despised riches: his nine-
teenth-century “ followers ” believe in Him—
and adore the Golden Calf.

The Waxman Scholarships.
In Melbourne Punch we read this paragraph,
apparently printed in all seriousness by our
“humorous ” contemporary;—
“ A complimentary banquet was given to Mr. A.
Waxman, at the Town Hall, on 15th April prior to
his departure for Europe. About 130 guests were
present, including representative men of all
classes. The Hon. Thos. Bent, M.L.A., presided,
and a most enjoyable evening was spent. A long
list of toasts was honoured, the chief one being, of
course, the guest of the evening. In responding
Mr. Waxman referred to his arrival here 80 years
ago, a poor and friendless boy, and testified his
recollection of early days by presenting the chair-
man with a cheque for £3OO in trust for a Wax-
man Prize for scnoolboys. The money was to be
invested at 6 per cent, and the Income, £l3, to be
devoted to 13 prizes, one each for the Bast and
West Jewish schools and 10 State schools nomin-
ated by the Minister of Education. The announce-
ment was received with loud cheers. The utmost
goodfeilowship prevailed, and it was midnight
before the banqueters had finished wishing their
guest Ibon voyage .”
This interesting paragraph, refers, we presume
to Mr. Aaron Waxman, the unblushing financier
1 who in Melbourne Insolvency Court some time
ago had to admit having screwed out of a young
Christian fool, one Petty, interest at tke rate of —
Holy Father Abbahamsh I—l4oo per cent, per
annum in transactions extending over years and
involving a considerable amount of money.
No wonder Mr. Aaron Waxman (J.P) is
now able to secure the presidential services
of that refined and splendid example of
Victorian statesmanship, Cabbage Bent —no
wonder he is able to clink his champagne-glass
among the best of the Christian trash in the mail"
boat saloon and look back with grateful emotion
upon his arrival in this golden Land (of Promise
to pay four months after date) 30 years ago, when
(sob) he was a poor and (more sobs) friendless
boy.” But, think of it, ye scoffing Gentiles—” a
cheque for £3OO in trust for a Waxman prize for
schoolboys!” Delightful thought: how Marcus
Clarke must smile in Paradise—if perchance the
Abrahams of this world have failed to register
with that Abraham into whose bosom they are ail
to climb, the judgments obtained on bills of ex-
change in terrestrial courts! A Waxman prize
for schoolboys! Tell us, O Aaron, is there pre-
sented to your lofty mind the splendid vision
of a long line of grateful schoolboys trooping
up to receive in future years their reward
for proficiency in the compound interest-table ?
Just think of Waxman investing £3OO in the
sacred name of Education at six per cent! Why,
had Melbourne’s chiefest financier lent it out at the
rate he charged Petty it would at the end of one
year have grown to £3BOO. Invested on similar
terms for another 13 months, and the Waxman
Education Fund would have had £39.300 at its
credit. Yet another year and there would be
£548.800 wherewith to reward the two little Jews
and the 10 little Christians. In four years, at 1400
per cent, compound interest (and without, mind
you, charging a single penny extra for renewing
the bills), £7,683,300 would be at the disposal of
the Victorian Minister of Education to encourage
the study of practical arithmetic by means of
Waxman scholarships And in five years the
little Waxman mustard seed of £3OO would have be-
come a noble oak of £107.564.800; while in six years
whoever happened to control the educational ar-
rangements of the Cabbage Garden would have
millions more than enough money on hand to buy
up Ireland and wipe out the entire British Na-
tional Debt. We do hope Aaron will stay in Aus-
tralia and finance New South Wales out of her
troubles.

Unclean! Unclean!
Says a good man, and not in Palestine, 3000 years
ago, but in a ’bus in George-street, Sydney, to-day.
It is not the cry of a leper to a medicine or magic-
man, but of half-a-dczen nice, clean, pleasant,
wholesome women, to the common sense of this
community. They are driving up town, they have
paid their way, and they hope to travel in comfort,
when suddenly the door opens, and in come a
couple of Chinamen. Yellow, opium-stinking,
unwashed, the taint of their nationality about
them, beasts to those good women—not men—un-
clean! unclean! Yes, there is no mistake about
it. Despite all the humanitarian and cosmopolitan
teachings of the age, the typical Chinaman remains
unclean. His nature, his essence, his unalterable
self is unclean. He doesn’t amalgamate, he doesn’t
ameliorate, he doesn’t read the papers, he doesn’t
wash, he neglects all the first duties of white
humanity. Then why should he enjoy Its privi-
leges—why should he ride in its ’buses? That is
the question of present interest. He has ways of
his own, houses of his own, dirt-smell offensive-
ness—all his own; let him have a ’bus, a railway
carriage- his own—and, if he won’t pay for them,
let him walk.
The Victorian Government Intend destroy ing such
numbers of Jos. Symes’ paper as contain “obscenity
or blasphemies. ’ Wo are not disposed to unre-
servedly back up the beliefs of Mr. Symes; for
Instance, we think that last number of the Libe-
rator, wherein he blackguards the R.C. Church,
and attempts to analyse Spencer, contains evi-
dence that Joseph is in some respects a most pre-
sumptuous person. But all the same we go for an
absolutely free Prefs. They have in Victoria a
strong Obscene Publications’ Act; if Symes offends
against it let'him be criminally prosecuted, and, if
guilty, seat to gaol. The age for blasphemy-
prosecutions is past—is as dead as the dodo
or the Tichborne claimant’s chances; and
why, we ask, should a Government that has in-
voked against Symes all the machinery of the
law courts and been soundly thrashed, be allowed
to affect its purposes in secret by a mean side-
wind ? The most blasphemous publication extant
is the War Cry, which does as much injury to
Christianity in a week as Joseph Symes could do
in ten lifetimes. If the Victorians are wise, they
will block all attempts at establishing a censorship
of the Press, even if such a censorship be pro-
posed in the interests]of a Heaven which should
be able to look after itself. The censorship will be
entrusted to some prejudiced fool with a fat salary,
who will merely carry out, with the passive aid of
that large section of ignorants who see no further
than their own noses, the behests of a compact and
well-organised band of bigots. Rank obscenity
excepted, the fate of a newspaper should be left
to the ultimately unerring verdict of public
opinion. No obscene word ever appears in
the Liberator, and this we say, after having
read almost every number of it. The fervent
pietists, who are just now so extensively and
worthily represented by the Melbourne D.T., and
by thieving bank officials, must indeed be in des-
perate straita if forced to rely on a press-censor-
ship to uphold the Good Cause.

The Melbourne bowling-team have arrived
in Sydney. The game of bowls Is a noble and
enthralling pastime, but no man ever takes to
bowls until he is 98in. round the waist, and wears
a 30in. collar to keep the pressure off his carotid
artery. Bowls means incipient paralysis. It also
means congestion of the liver, and fatty degener-
ation of the heart; likewise Bright’s disease,
B aDguineous apoplexy, and the jim-jams. The
typical bowler is a man who breathes ster-
torously, takes brandy-and-soda on arising, and
runs in a cow-iike manner to catch the train with
the las'; bite of a four-chop, eight-egg, and slx-oup-
of-tea breakfast in his mouth. He is a man who
works like a horse all the morning in a close
office, and who, at lunch-time (limited strictly to
half-an-hour) stokes himself with soup, fish, beef,
sweets, anl cheese, and pint-o’-beer accompani-
ment-followed by one glass of curacoa and a
strong cigar. Then he rushes back to the office,
swears at his clerks, and buries his head in the
bill-book. On Saturday afternoon he takes three
glassoj of whisky-and-water after lunch, and (he
thinks) fully atones to Nature for his week’s work,
worry and gluttony by trundling some wooden
balls along an artificial green-sward. This is a
mad world.

That choice and cultured assortment of pig-
murderers and retail whisky-sellers known as the
Sydney Corporation, have collectively made up
what they are pleased to call their minds to spoil
Macquarie-street. They are paving that hitherto
pleasant thoroughfare with wooden blocks—for
the benefit, we suppose, of the sick and dying in
Sydney Infirmary, wao just now are John
M‘Elhonb having ceased to bawl at midnight in
the Assembly Chamber hard by—in comparative
peace. We suppose that the thoughtful action of
these facetious representatives of the pork and
grog interests in unnecessarily inflicting upon the
inhabitants of a quiet street wherein there is
comparatively little traffic, the horrid rattle of
carls and cabs passing over an " ultimately
economical” paving, is preparatory to the run-
ning by Government of a steam-tram right down
the middle of one of the only streets in Sydney
now worth firing in. However that may be, it is
plain that when the Corporation shall have done
its worst Sydney hospital will neither be worth
living in nor dying in. The wind-up of an irritable
hospital-patient who expires to the wood-block
tattoo accompaniment of Sydney Corporation is by
no means pleasant to contemplate. The Invisible
Genius, whatever it may be, which hovers round
Sydney Town Hall, and dominates whatever in-
tellect Is possessed by the alderman, must, ere it
departed this world have lived in a rum-shop and
studied ‘.eatheticism at a slaughter-house amidst
the groans of dying swine.
Charity doesn’t begin at home in New South
Wales. Need for charity exists now at Lithgow
among the widows and children of the men killed
in the colliery. At the same time there is the
bogus “Patriotic” Fund—a sum of about £40.000,
raised for the purpose of rewarding the slaughter
of blackfellows who fought for their country and
their homes-daily accumulating interest. When
there seemed a chance of stars, ribands, baronet-
cies, C M G.-ships, being earned by a leaf from a
cheque-book, how the hundreds and the thousands
rattled ini Now the case is altered. People are
asked not to help in murdering blacks, but in
saving whites-and a paltry two or three hundred
is all that can be raised, even with Lord Caring-
ton as collector-in-chief. Where are the wealthy
philanthropists who will help in secret the dead
miners’ children ?

The “Victorian Natives” are sorry that they
asked their legal luminary, J. L. Purves, to
have his little say on the New Hebrides question.
The keen-witted brow-beating barrister has so
carefully cultivated the art of making himself ur.
pleasant, that it would seem he can’t open his
mouth without hurting somebody’s feelings. At
the Melbourne demonstration, Mr. Purves trod
upon the corns of his audience with the charac*
terlstlc professional indifference. That he escaped
from the meeting in one piece is due only to the
happy accident of birth. Who, but a protected
native, would have dned to tell descendants of
“ Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled ” that the Scotch
are a “ conquered people ? ” Or have ventured to
remind offspring of the Sons of Erin that their
proud ancestors bent the knees to the perfidious
Saxon? Mr, Purves dis. this— ay, and worse. Per-
haps the bootings and hisses of young Australia
put him on his mettle. Perhaps he was actuated
by pure cussedness. Anyway, it wasn’t a burning
desire to make himself affable, which prompted
the patriotic Purves to mention that “ when Aus.
tralia was first colonised by the British, they did
with it 'what the great and gallant French nation
was now doing with New Caledonia.” This his-
torical reminiscence alienated the orator from his
few remaining friends among the audience. By
the time he sat down the Victorian Natives awoke
to the painful fact that their pet barrister had

II was telegraphed the other day that Mr. Miles,
the Queensland Minister lor Works, had de
dined to copy the example of N.S.W. in allowing
race-horses to travel by rail at half rates. There
would not have been much in the news had not
the Minister's reason been attached to the decision
Mr. Miles (or Billy, as his familiars call him), told*
the deputation that he looked on racing as gam-
bling, and could not—we almost think we see Miles
straightening out his rugged features as the moral
necessities of the case presented themselves—
sanction any concession for such purposes. Hudi-
bras makes certain people compensate for the sins
they are inclined to by damning those they have
no mind to. Billy, than whom no man in Queens-
land has speculated more spiritedly in runs, grass-
laden or drought-stricken peradventure the
bearers of the veritable Golden Fleece, and perad-
venture the sepulchres of famished hopes -sitting
up with a shocked conscience when horse-racing
is suggested, is an eminently Hudlbrastio figure.
The situation should be perpetuated in stone, or
in brass. Braes Is better.

The Melbourne Aegus, commenting upon the
story told by Father Cone in Sydney the other
day concerning the trading propensities of the
English missionaries in the Loyalty Isles, quotes
this sentence of the reverend gentleman: “These
English missionaries teach the blacks to call them
‘Messiah,’ and order them, in the name of the
Gospel, to trade with none but themselves,” and
says, “to most English readers the tale of the
reverend gentleman will sound incredible.” If it
does, then those English readers have never heard
of a certain reverend person in the South Seas
who has made himself, not only the Messiah, but
the whole Trinity of the credulous niggers-and is
Pope, Prime Minister, and Biard of Trade in one
pious person. We do not say this because we
blame the missionaries for making their little
piles—in fact, we know that if we were in their
places our invariable formula would be—after we
had Christianised the heathen to such an extent as
to inspire them with a salutary fear of hell—" Do
business with us -or be damned.” What we do
blame a lot of them for, however, is their hypo,
critical pretence of disinterested piety and yearn I
ing after tho salvation of souls. It is, we hope'
unnecessary for us to state that when we say this
we are not making a sweeping assertion or Imply-
ing that all Protestant missionaries devote a good
deal of their time among the heathen to feathering
their worldly nests. But we know for a
fact that a great many of them do, and these
we blame, not, as we said before, for keep-
ing their eyes on the plunder, but for not having
the moral courage to admit openly that they do it.
If they had this moral courage and owned up they
would receive our unalloyed admiration, as we
don’t believe the Papuan heathen can be Christian
ised under three generations, and see no reason
why the servants of the Lord should not make an
honest penny out of the first two before they
finally go to the devil.
To Ruth
The old white house, with sheltering eaves,
The silver-shining river,
The fabled trees with pale-green leaves,
For ever doomed to quiver;
The ancient dial, and the tree
On which 1 carved your name.
The liower-beds girt with rosemary,
They all are here the same.
And I am here, but I am changed
From youth to tottering age;
And you, beloved one, still estranged.
And closed Is Pleasure’s page.
Ruth, can no deed of mine atone ?
Come back, my love, coace back;
So old, ah I leave me not alone.
To tread the downward track.
Condone those errors of my youth,
A pitying oar incline;
“ To err is only human,” Ruth I
Forgiveness is divine.

The story comes from China. It was a
Chinese judge, and he improved on Solomon’s
plan. P.acing the infant in a circle made with
chalk on the ground, the two mothers were re-
quested to pull it out, and the true ma showed
herself by not hauling. We did a little in that
line ourselves one time; it was a little hov in dis-
pute. We took him outside the court and rolled
him in the gutter. On bringing him in the true
mother showed out by welting the unfortunate
juvenile about the ears, top false one being utterly
indifferent to the state of his “ pinny.”
Thus an English paper re the last Queen’s

boys, and unemployed Paters; the remarks of the
last-mentioned upon the ocounants being Ire-
quently more to the point that strictly nice or
polite. The number of debutantes with recognis-
able claims to prettiness was small. Instead, there
was a bewildering plenty of matronly-looking
women, who were laced to death and painted like
pets of the ballet, and who were frequently dis-
gusted to a degree at the slow progress their vehi-
cles made towards the desired haven.”
Perhaps you have heard about that Hue-
garlan servant girl who lost a good situation last
month under quite exoeplional circumstances. Hf r
master was the Protestant parson at Sz )lnok, and
hia wife loved somebody else, not wisely, but too
well. As this was a reversal of the usual order of
things in clerical families the parson decided upon
r-revenge. He ordered the servant to stand
around with a candle while “missus” confessed
on a sheet of foolscap Toen he blotted the eon-
fefsion, shot his giddy wife, shot her three
children, chucked the servant under the chin, and
shot himself. The poor surviving girl was so dis-
tressed that she ran for the gens d'a/rmes without
stopping to loot the valuables. Now she regrets
that she ever “held the candle to the devil.”

Thereupon the governess to his children put

He must have been almost as popular as an opera-
te tenor who once visited Sydney. We went to
visit this celebrity one morning. He was confined
to his room with a slight cold, they said, but

say, “ Oh, hang spouting—had enough of it.”
The poet Whittier requests the return of

It is alleged that a certain banker who re-

have every respect for your high office, which

my prejudice in refusing to trust valuable docu-

That cultured periodical, the Irish and
Australian World (Gunnedah, N.S.W.) cour-

are not sorry to hear of the death of any such
tirent as W. E. Foster, we are very glad to hear
that he has gone to the land of Hackies where
there is no back doors.” Then follows this spark-
ling political item:—“Payment of Members is
giving one of our hash the spike, McDougalsays
the payment of members will reduce his salary £3O
a year. Mack, we would advise you to take a
billet as plough boy on a Cow Farm.”
It is quite too distressing to learn from the
S.M. Herald that Major Eustace Burnaby,
a near relative of plucky IFred. Burnsby,
has accepted the gingerbread billet of London
City Marshal. All that the outside world sees of a
city marshal is when he puts on a ridiculous uni-
form and rides a fat horse in the Lord Mayor’s
show. We shall expect to hear next that a relative
of Colonel Gordon has been selected to fill a dis-
tinguished role in the royal kitchen, or that Hen-
niker Heaton’s uncle has been made a policeman.
It’s awful that the reputations of heroes should
be thus indirectly tarnished.
It is said that Weber, before he attained
much reputation, was much annoyed by a drama-
tic critic named Muller, Vho persistently and
savagely slated him. Wearying of these attacks
Weber at last struck a brilliant idea. He went
away to another district, and caused his sudden
death to be announced, whereupon Muller wrote
an extravagantly eulogistic obituary notice, for
which Weber, to the immense confusion of the
critic, warmly thanked him. The composer and
the critic got on very well after this. It would
not do for many N.S.W. politicians to try such a
plan unless they wanted to rake in some good libel
paragraphs.
Captain Steele, who came to N.S.W. from
Scotland in the year 1830, died at Port Macquarie
last week at an advanced age. His life was a
chequered one— once he was the largest land-
owner in the colony, possessing hundreds of thou-
sands of acres of the finest property, besides ex-
cellent herds of cattle, droves of horses, and Hocks
of sheep. Captain Steele also secured many
Government contracts—he wrested from Major
Innes privilege of supplying stores for the
Port Macquarie convicts—and at one time must
have been at least a millionaire. Through pres-
sure of his creditors he lost all his possessions, and
died in penury and rags.
It seems that Miss Lotinga, daughter of

on the Derby and Oaks, and started her with the

there has arrived in Sydney a Lotinga, who
has promptly set up in the money-lending line in
Bllzabeth-street. It would be a whimsical idea to
suppose that this was the fair one’s deceased
father, only he could not well have got through

Acctndmg to an article in the Pall Mall,
ana copied into the Sydney D.T., the Prince of
Wales is “a fair, large, fine-looking man,” with
“a curious likeness to his greatest of ancestors,
(sic) Henry YIII.” Let’s see. Henry VIII. spent
about 10 times his Income, ate like a pig, drank
like a fish, murdered half a dozen wives, and lost
his head completely when a pretty woman was in
the vicinity. He was also corpulent, and bloated.
Does our treasonable contemporary now think
that Wales resembles his “greatest of ancestors”
very much? We have seen Wales. He is a little
squat man who wore an absurd frock coat to hide
his superfluous protoplasm, and was the “dead
image ” of a certain .well-known German-Jewish
Sydney money-lender.
It is funny to imagine the Queen at a
circus, yet she had one rigged up in the Royal
Mews at Windsor, and went to it with “ Bee,” Bat.,
and the usual following. We would have given
worlds to have seen that circus. What did the
clowns say ? Had they the heart to crack their
cast-iron jokes in the face of their Sovereign—to
wheeze in the ear of the Princess Louise ? We
suppose that “politics were eschewed” and the
quips and retorts” confined to the subjects of
Art and the “ Scenery Abroad,” as it is in tne con-
versation among the guests in the ante-room prior
to her Majesty’s dinner. By the way. Fleming
Norton once performed before her Majesty, who
expressed herself delighted. But then, after all,
Fleming himself is almost a circus.
Said Rev. Dr. Steel to the Sydney faithful
on Sunday week:—“lt had been a privilege in the
past that those men who worked in the night to
provide the daily paper should have their day of
rest every week; but now there was the Sunday
paper, the production of which rendered Sabbath
labour necessary. The weekly papers, too, were
mostly published towards the end of the week, and
were in all parts of the colony by the- time the
Sabbath came round. This had a tendency to
secularise the Sabbath.” What do you suggest,
Doctor ? Is it that The Bulletin’s nublieatlon-
day should be regulated by the clergy ? Monday’s
paper is set up on Sunday night; Sunday’s paper
is setup on Saturday night; ergo, the proprietors
of the Sunday Times are much holier than the
Messrs. Fairfax.

where he was lately employed as clerk In Parlia-
ment House. When hit by the knuckly hand of
Democracy, Snellgrove wisely quitted Victoria.
He would have turned his face to England, had, in
fact, made some notions that way, only that cir-
cumstances stood up before him like a glass-bot-
tled twenty-foot wail. Civil Service lifewas his ideal
and Berry had taught him that there could be no
fixity of tenure in the pursuit in the country of
his first adoption, so to clear from it was an im-
perative necessity. He succeeded in pouring him-
self into a small hole up in Queensland. His abili-
ties were not large, and he, therefore, relied, as a
poverty-frightened man of mediocre power does
well to do, on an ever-vigilant industry. Promo-
tion came, and he arose in the Custom-house.
Promotion again, and he headed a branch in con-
nection with the distilleries. Promotion again,
and he became a Parliamentary clerk. Promotion
again, and he died.
Queenslanders will soon bid good-bye—let
us nope not finally—to one of the most unobtrusive
and most useful members of their judicial bench.
Judge Paul, as we have already announced, is in
ill-health. Government has resolved to relieve
him of duty. Years ago the judge was admitted
to be the most competent man in the colony for
making his way through the outside districts.
The accommodation houses held him in the ten-
derest respect. His name would come first, the
judge a day or two after, and In one day more the
“ little bill ” would make its appearance. It was
ftt this stajre the crisis of the hour was ex-
perienced. The judge knew just exactly the price
of everything, and with quiet decision ordered
that bill to be amended. In vain the publican would
pretend that it was the fault of the book keeper.
' Yer Hanner, ’ said one upon one occasion, “ye
don’t know the sorra and vexation of having a
drunken bookkeeper. Hera he goes away and
puts ye down twice as much as a common loafing
swagman, whereas when ye was coming I im-
pressed on him that there wasn’t the slightest dif-
ference between yez. wed ad, I’ll go and wallop
him as soon as yer Hanner laves. Maybe it’s this
item yer Hanner objects to ? ” As a general thing,
it was that item, not excluding those before and
after. However, Judge Paul knew how to deal
generously when the right occasion presented
Itself. He had simply a constitutional objection
to being “ dona.” He never acquired a brilliant
reputation in his profession, though on matters
connected with mining disputes and the floating
of companies he had, by personal experience, a
varied assortment of knowledge.
It is well for Mr. James Anthony Fronde
that. He had acquired'a good reputation before he
wrote “ Oceana.” Half the inaccuracies and mis-
representations found in that book would destroy
the character of any but a first-rate author. To
read ‘‘Oceana,” anyone would say he had been
over New Zealand. The cool impudence with
which he talks of various places, and what they
reminded him of, could not be surpassed by the
St. Petersburg correspondent of the Croagojingo-
long weekly Wrapper. Wo did not think greatly
°f his accuracy in respect to persons and places in
N.S.W., but lucubrations about N.Z. prove that
his imagination must have been sluggish when he
was writing about us. All he personally saw of
that country was Rotorua, the Northern Club, and
Kawau. Almost all his time he spent in reading
Greek plays. Yet he goes home, writes his book,
possibly from almanacs and old newspapers, and
poses as a conscientious and personal authority on
things and places at the Antipodes. Froude should
have a conscience—at all events he had one when
he left the church. We don't feel that we would
like to ask the St. Petersburg correspondent of the
Wrapper what he did with Ms conscience. But we
should like to whisper the query into the near ear
of James Anthony, who, at leaving the church,
refunded—listen Charles Strong !—his last two
years’ stipend on the ground that during that
period he had been in a state of doubt as to the
truth of his professions. Is it possible that he
wrote “ Oceana ” without a return of the old com-
plaint ?
Sir Anthony and Lady Musgrave have left,
and Government House in Brisbane is now
tenanted by Sir Arthur Hunter Palmer. Sir
Arthur is a white-headed old man now, but all the
young Are is not dead in him. We remember
seeing him at Beaufort once—a wild run away off
in the Queensland Never Never, where scraggy
trees and luxuriant grass alternate-scare the wits
out of a gigantic new-chum by the mere audacity
of his English. He was past the age of lighting,
but though the centuries come and go, it Is safe to
say Sir Arthur will never pass the climacteric of
resonant and sulphur-smelling vocables. Prom
the day a Tipperary man threw him into a wash-
-0091 for his ‘‘gab,” til), a couple of weeks ago,
Chief Justice jLilley told him to step down from
the witness-box, “as the Court did not think he
had discretion enough to be chargeable with the
folly of his language,” Sir Arthur has been given
to speak first and think after. Perhaps his being
an Irishman accounts to some extent for that. Sir
Arthur, as may be inferred, was always a staunch
partisan. He was a Liberal at heart but a Conser-
vative at pocket. _He still wants the poor to
become rich—but without in any way encroaching
upon the wealthy. His convictions are perfectly
nonest. His head was made in two compartments
with a brick partition between. He takes turns of
occupying them. Hence he has firm believers in him
at both extremes of the social system. Of late years
he has filled the office of President of the Queens-
land Legislative Council, and even in that sphere of
usefulness the old station-manager qualities come
frequently to the front. As Lieutenant-Governor
he will be something of a study for philosophical
persons who delight in observing what changes of
position effect in certain classes of minds.
Notwithstanding the fillip which the patro-
nage of Governor Carington gives to art mat-
ters in Sydney, the enthusiasm for that sort of
culture appears to be much more genuine in Mel-
bourne. We notice that the exhibition held lately
in connection with the Victorian National Gallery
School of Arts, under the directorship of Mr.
Polingsby, was looked upon by the public in the
spirit which alone testifies that the artist is really
appreciated. That is, the competition for the pur-
chase of pictures was brisk. Four days before
the inauguration of the exhibition, 18 pictures
were actually bought by parties in no way associ-
ated with what is called the encouragement of
native talent. Three years ago we drew attention
in these columns to the promise displayed in a
picture at that time exhibited by a young amateur
from the KeHy country. It is gratifying to note
that Mr. Longstaff, the youth in question, is ful-
filling expectations, His “Motherless” comes in
for very high praise indeed, both from the com-
mittee and the public. One enthusiastic writer
classes it with “ The Widower,” by Pildes, which
now hangs in the Sydney Art Gallery. Mr. Long-
staff has had very little technical training. His
people are in an humble way of trade in Sheppar-
ton, and while young he had to bear a hand in
work uncongenial to the artistic soul. But his
idle hours- -and in such a place as Shepparton,
the busiest man has idle hours—were given wholly
and with enthusiasm to the pencil. His work is
not characterised by mere technical completeness.
It crosses the dividing line and gets into the
domain of invention. Ho is a pale, delicate young
man, but if health keeps up, there is every likeli-
hood that he will bo of the few natives who
make a mark in art.
Political

A Bill is before the Commons to abolish

The steam lauo'i “ Carrington ” cost

In the Commons, the other night, out of

An Act of Parliament, now-a-days, is best

tion is muddle. We have spoken.
“iThe country,” says an English journal,

In 10 years or less the House of Lords will be like
the Ark—a memory of a vanished marvel.”
Since 1855, saysLabouchere, the peers have
drawn £130,000,000, in salaries, from the British
people; in the same period each Duke has had on
an average 56 relatives living on the public Ex-
chequer.
We have seen on the throne (says that
courteous newspaper Reynolds), first, George the
Third, a lunatic; secondly, George the Fourth, an
unmitigated reprobate ; thirdly, William the
Fourth, a fool; and now Victoria, a miserly re-
cluse.
When in the Commons on sth March last,
166 members voted for the abolition of the Lords a
cool, hard, clear-toned voice exclaimed, “The
Writing on the Wall!” All the newly-created
baronets in the House voted for the hereditary
principle.
The Wide Bay News, edited by William
Keith, condemns the imbecility of Jennings’ New
Hebrides’ despatch. Such of our readers as are
anxious to bring about the annexation of the
South Pole will do well to place themselves in
communication with William. This continent is
already so crowded that we haven’t space to stand
up in, and we must get room somewhere.
A fact not generally known—That the
King of Greece draws £4OOO a year from the Eng-
lish Civil List. The Grand Old Man can settle
what the papers love to call “ The Greek Ques-
tion ” at any minute, by threatening to knock off
the royal allowance. Another thing not generally
known is—why the King of Greece gets that
£4OOO. Even the monarch himself is hazy on that
point.
London is to have a new bridge over the
Thames at the Tower, and a petition, signed by
4000 citizens, has been presented to the Common

Ye gods I Freetrade England, the home of the

Cardinal Moran, in a most eloquent address
to the Hibernians of Sydney, attributed the
brightening prospects of the Home Rule party to
the fidelity of the people to the Catholic Church.
Of course, it is useless to tell the cardinal that the
political concessions to the Irish are due, not to
Roman Catholicism, but to the spread among the
great exponents of English thought of those
humane principles which point to a time when
churches will be regarded as superfluous.
An ex-Fijian missionary is a candidate for
the Queensland Parliament. If he succeeds he
will find an extensive field for missionary work in
that weird Witenagemote. He will discover that
the ferocious Fijian is a gentle and docile creature
compared to the average Queensland politician.
The former may be converted with a little time
and trouble; the latter never repents—until he
has been 10 minutes in Gehenna. This statement
also applies to a considerable number of our own
statesmen in a small way.
A new Homestead Bill submitted in Ohio
and lowa proposes to give to any citizen over 31
years of age, and the head of a family, on satisfac-
tory evidence that neither he nor his family are
owner of personal property above the value of

residing upon and cultivating it, a parcel of land,
not to exceed 30 acres, to be his so long as he
resides upon it and cultivates it. Now then, Mr
Heydon, with your “Land and Industrial Alli-
ance,” what do you say to that 2
Said Bradlaugh in the Commons on March
9:— “ The British people were a law-abiding people
on the whole, and in the labour movement here
the large majority of them had shown that they
were patient, “'filing to submit to authority, and
to wait for reform. But there was an oratory
more potent than any that could address the
House—the oratory of hunger, which was listened
to without any reason in the judgment that was
given; and if the House left hunger to speak when
they might anticipate the appeal, on them would
fall the penalty and the shame.”
Sir John Macdonald, of Canada, on Im-
perial Federation Imperial Federation is
utterly impracticable. We could never agree to
send a number of men over to England to sit in
Parliament there and vote away our rights and
privileges. I am, as this question goes, up to the
handle a Home Ruler. We wifi govern our own
country. We will put on the taxes ourselves. If
we choose to misgovern ourselves we will do so,
and we do not desire England, Ireland, or Scotland
to tell us we are fools. We wifi say, ‘lf we are
fools, we wifi keep , our folly to ourselves.’ You
will not be the worse for it, and we will not be the
worse for any folly of yours.” Listen, ye Jingo
dreamers I
Mr. Joe Chamberlain is rather over-doing
the thing when he insists, according to a late
cablegram, on a separate Parliament for that piece
of Ireland called Ulster. Ulster must be a long
way behind the Australian colonies if it thinks
that all people now-a-days are to be classed as Pro-
testants or Catholics. To us the thing looks like
classifying sensible men as knock-kneed or bandy-
legged. We care not one rap about tho distinc-
tions between Orangemen and Papists. Every man
is welcome here who will be fairly honest. So it
should be in Ulster. Mr. Chamberlain’s proposals
are of the Brummagem order. Irishmen are quite
able to manage their own affairs without reference
to ;Pope Peool, or Elizabeth, or William of blessed
memory.
During the late Russian scare Field-Mar-
shal Sargood, of tho Victorian Defence Depart-
ment, proposed that the Government should buy
a drove of debilitated hulks which were rotting
about the bay, so that they might have something
to sink at the port entrance if war broke out The
hulks were bought-for £5700. War didn’t burst
forth, and the Government were left with five old
tubs on its hands that no man with a fragment of
conscience would trust his mother-in-law in. One
of them settled down a while ago and is now
under the blue waters of Hobson’s Bay in the
occupation of a merman and his wife and family.
The remaining four were sold last week,
realised £1464, one being bought in by tho patriot o
vendor for £6OO.

no wonder that one of the chief factors in the
North’s desire for political separation from the
South is the presumption and petty-tyranny of a
Brisbane-appointed Civil service. As an example
of the kind of thin# which obtains in the North,
take the case of the “ Admirable Crichton,” of
Port Mangrove, who “ holds It ” thus: He is—sub-
collector of customs, land commissioner, harbour
and pilot master, J.P., and acting-P.M., chairman
of nospital committee, secretary of church com-
mittee, secretary of school committee, secretary
of cemetery, trustee of School of Arts, and—lay-
reader, It is a pleasing thing to see a man thus
Immolate himself on the altar of duty.
According to the Pali. Mali,, at an
emigration conference in London lately ‘‘papers
read upon the condition of tne Australian labour-
market expressed very contradictory opinions as
to emigrants’ prospects in the respective colonies.”
Which reminds us that one of the works to b a dis-
tributed at the Indo-Colonial Exhibition in Lon-
don is “NS.W. in 1881,” and another is ‘‘The
Industries of N.S.W.” Both of these works are
eminently calculated to hold out “ false hopes ” to
intending emigrants. The latter book, for in-
stance, gives glowing accounts of the magnitude
of the local iron-indnstry, which, to all intents and
purposes, is dead as Julius Cnesar. Anyone who
emigrates to Australia on tne strength of the
volume in question will have been brought here
on false pretences.
A New Caledonian paper observes that one
of the greatest delusions young communities live
under is that their respective Parliaments are the
worst-mannered in civilisation. In support, a
bird’s eye view of a late sitting of the Hungarian
Diet is given. Baron Bukavina, a member, arises
and puts his tongue out at all and sundry on the
Opposition benches He is remonstrated with. He
then puts a thumb to his nose, attaches the other
hand, and waggles the fingers vigorously. M.
Popovie, the President, appeals to irm to conduct
himself more decently The Baron Informs him
that he (the President) is the head of a company
of brutes. At this stage the House determines to
assert its dignify and passes a vote expelling the
Baron for 60 sittings. The Baron takes up his hat,
walks to the door, and, turning round, spits three
times at the assemblage of senators.
When Sir Henry Parkes argues that tne
prosperity of a colony depends on the high char-
acters of the people who first come to it from the
parent country, he is strangely forgetful of the
teacoings of experience. Prophecies about the
New Hebrides are checkmated by Australian facts.
They are also ia the teei h of political philosophy.
It Is nearly 60 years since Samuel Taylor Cole-
ridge, with France, England, Germany, and Hol-
land before him, proved that the character of
colonial dependencies stood in inverse ratio to the
character of the parent people. “The best people
la the mother country will generally be the worst
in the colonies; the worst at home will be the
test abroad,” These were his words, His main
position was—and a man with Sir Henry's defer-
ence to great names will, no doubt, find food for
reflection in the fact—that colonists of a well-
governed country will degenerate, and that those
of an ill-governed country will improve.
A very noticeable feature about the Eight
Hours’ Demonstration in Melbourne last week
was the unenthuslastic, even collected, manner in
which that benign shade of royalty, Governor
Loch, was greeted by the workmen—who “ didn’t
cheer worth a bone button.” The local dallies
tried to gloss over this apathy with the excuse
that the men did not know where his smooth-
tongued mightiness was located, but the excuse
won’t do. When the vice-regal carriage was
driven through the surging crowd in Swanston-
Street a feeble wail went forth from the throats of
several boys who wanted to yell anyhow, they
didn’t care at whom; but that could not be mag-
nified Into he irty vociferation even by a Herald
reporter. The aboriginal (he was well washed,
and a bit of a dude) gesticulating from his honour-
able position among the old pioneers, received
more acclamation than i.ord and Lady Loen, the
Mieses Loch, the Masters Loch, and the gorgeous
Side-de-oamp. This is hard, but true.
Earl Spencer—the much-detested “ Red
Jack ’’—who for some years administered the
Irish Government, and has ever maintained that
Ireland can only be successfully ruled by her
own people, has, according to the cablegrams,
turned up as an able champion of tne
Home Rule proposals of Mr. Gladstone. On the
other hand, our old friend, Robert Lowe, is bitterly
opposed to Home Rule. And this man lived in
Australia! But then cur Bob has been made a
lord by a Sovereign. It should be remembered
that a good deal of Bob’s rents are drawn from
Sydney where Home Rule waxes fat and kicks
even to Republicanism- la he looking around for
some Irish investment where more rents may be
squeezed out by a great British army supported
by the British taxpayer? Is he afraid wo are
about to touch up the absentees with a property-
tax, instead of taking care at our own expense
that Bob’s interests here are well guarded ?
The farmers of the Grafton district voiced
the indignation they feel at the proposed exemp-
tion of agricultural produce from tne ad valorem
duties at the Grafton Theatre last week. The
meeting was thorougkfly representative and its
members unanimous n urging protection for the
farmers. If farmers and those dependent on them
are alive to their interests, meetings of a similar
character will be held all over the colony. It is
absurd to say that N.B.W. will not grow wheat
equal to any in Australia. Wo have the country
and we have the climate, and the imposition of
ad valorems would stimulate agriculture so that
there need toe no necessity for paying for thou-
gande of bushels of breadstuffs from colonies pro-
tected by thvfr tariffs against any other importa-
tions of products whjoh If *B* W. could make to re-
store the balance of trade. Farmers are prpver-
felally slow to move, but they deserve to suffer if
they allow this opportunity to pass unheeded.
“ Lord R. Montague, in a letter regarding
his withdrawal from the Church of Rome, writes
that he wish* s to explain that ha left the Church
fin June 19, 1883, after giving his reasons at length
in a letter to Cardinal Manning—namely, the un-
christian end even revolutionary principles pro-
mulgated by the Cardinal and R.C. bishops of the
British Empire, and s openly inculcated by the
priests in Ireland and elsewhere.” The Irish
priests don’t advise their flocks to pay impossible
rents and starve. Hence the skedaddlement of
this titled fraud This Montague man will doubt-
less find in the bosom of the Established Church,
with its fat livings and its adoration of the
nobility ” and the much-propertied classes in
general, the sort of religion taught by Christ the
socialist. And were that same Christ again on
earth, he would be preached against by thy Angli
can Bishops and sent to gaol by the Tories, a set of

As bearing upon the question of Church
jJiaestablishment in Wales, the Pali, mall
gazette quotes the following figures:—”ln Mont-
shire, the population is 5851, the average
enurch attendance during January was 437, and
the value per annum of the livings is £3884. In
Kymwhlre, the figures were respectively
mod, 123, and £3364. In Pembrokeshire, they were
3148,10. and £799. Or, in percentages, in Mont-
gomeryshire 4 per cent, of the population attend,
at a cost to the tithe-payers of £ll each; in Car-
narvonshire, 3 per cent., at a cost of £2O; in Pem-
brokeshire, per cent., at a cost of £80.” This
return shows very clearly that the Welsh are not
inclined to greatly over-estimate the importance
of the ministrations of the aristocratic loafers who
make a remarkably good thing out of the livery
of the Lord. The division on Mr. Dilwynn’s motion
for Disestablishment shows that the time has
nearly come when this system ot clerical robbery
will be upset—the whlte-chokered brigands be
cast one on the mercies of a calculating world,
which avers that " if a man will not work neither
shall he eat ” The only wonder is that such a
system of State swindling in the name of the
Gospel should have existed for so long.
“ There is a disgraceful association in
London called the London Missionary Society. Its
object is to drain off money which might go to the
support and education of the poor and miserable
in England, instead of providing breeches and
beer for the noble ravage. This fussy body spends
yearly hundreds of thousands of pounds earned by
British workmen in sending missionaries into out-
of-the-way places, where the people are infinitely
better off, infinitely more healthy, infinitely more
contented, than thousands upon thousands of our
own wretched population The Chancellor of the
Exohrquer ought really to look to this matter,
and Impose a heavy tax on these mad missionary
contributions. You find men like the Archbishop
of Canterbury stalking about the country in order
to preach charity sermons for missionaries’ enter-
prises. Here are his own countrymen, more
deeply in the mire of vice, degradation, and misery
than most savages. Where is the crusade on be-
half of our fellow-citizens by the parliamentary
bishops? If old tea-drinking spinsters or tearful
widows are able to afford so much money for the
reform of the inhabitants of Bze chuen and Mate-
bele, they ought to be forced to contribute a
larger share to the burdens of the State in which
they are permitted to live.— Reynolds.
The New Hebrides hysteria is so epidemic
that ’tis hard to say who has it worst. Presby-
terian parsons we can sympathise with. Naturally
enough, they have come to regard the heathen of
those islands as their legitimate prey, and their
distress in the present crisis is understandable.
But for certain of the Australian Natives’ “Pat-
riotic” Associations we should cordially recom-
mend a little soothing mixture, or—that best of all
treatments for hysteria - cold water, fresh from
the Press. This latter, alas! may be looked for in
vain. The wildest ravings appear to find most
favour with the Sydney and Melbourne dailies,
THE YOUNG FELLER.
THE OLD FELLOW: “SAY, YOUNG FELLER, WHEN YER GET THROUGH FEEDIN’ OFF
ER THAT ’ERE CANE, YOU JEST PUT IT BACK FROM WHERE YER TUK IT;
THAT’S YER OWN THE OTHER SIDE OF YER.”
whose chief aim apparently is to lure the young
Australian into a belief in his deml-godlsm. How
well their efforts are succeeding is instanced by
mapy recent public utterances. The Mayor of
Melbourne, presiding over some New Hebrides
hysterics at the Town Hall, said: “ He would con-
clude by stating that all the speakers who would
address the meeting were of Australian birth—
a fact which augured well for the future of Austra-
lasia.” Now, wnat toe Dickens did the worthy
Mayor mean? He didn’t know. Neither did the
reporters, but they peppered “applauses” and
“loud applauses” into that paragraph on prin-
ciple. Now, suppose the resident Frenchmen of
Australasia called a meetiag at a Town Hall and
monopolised the oratory. Tq that case, we sup-
pose, the “future of Australasia” would be as
good as squelched.
At a recent meeting called in Kempsey,
N.B. W„ with a view of presenting Mr. R. B. Smith,
M.P., with an address on his departure to glisten
in London, we learn by a local paper that “ Mr.
Woolford had much pleasure in moving the first
resolution, viz.: ‘ That Mr. Smith has the hearty
concurrence of this meeting in his projected trip
to England,’” and another patriot remarked: " he
agreed that Mr. Smith’s ideas will be enlarged as
to bridges, bar-harbours, and so forth.” Here is
satire for you! But a jingle I
It is unfashionable to lavish any sympathy
whatever on the Australian squatters, but just
now their way is just a trifle harder than that of
the average transgressor. The wool-market
shows no decided signs of improvement, fat cattle
and sheep come in to a heart-breaking market,
money is daily becoming tighter, station values
are falling every month so that the bank-man-
ager’s private “sweating-room” seem to be the
only abiding-place of the impoverished pastoral-
ists, and in some districts the drought Is clearing
every hoof off the run, while to add to the trouble
in N.S.W.. a land-tax threatens to act as the last
straw. The impost on incomes need not concern
many of the station-holders unless things rapidly
become easier, for a very little more of the pre-
sent trouble will give the average squatter’s run
to the bank and his former income to a syn-
dicate. The squatter of to-day Is not by any
means the bloated millionaire which he is repre-
sented to be by each Domain Demosthenes. We
personally know a dozen squatters who, rich men
a few years ago, have come to irretrievable smash.
Among them is one firm of good manly fellows,
whose names are synonymous with open-hamded-
ness and fair dealing, and who, not so very long
since, could command at five minutes’ notice any
amount of money up to a quarter of a million.
Now they are hopelessly ruined and find them-
selves hard-up for a £lO note. No wonder the
banks are paying 10,15, 20, and 35 per cent, divi-
dends. We all know the state of a country in
which the pawnbroker does the best business.
The cabled secession of Mr. Trevelyan
Chief Secretary for Scotland, from the Gladstone
Ministry, came at an unfortunate moment for the
Highland crofters. For the present, presumably,
nothing further will be heard of Mr. Trevelyan’s
Bill to Amend the Law relating to Tenure of
Land by Crofters. This is the more to be re-
gretted, because, in his introductory speech, the
Secretary hinted at the desirability of establishing
some system of State aid for the crofters. It ap-
pears that the Irish fishermen have been immensely
benefited by means of the Sea Fisheries Fund and
Irish Reproductive Fund, which advanced some
£70,000 or £BO,OOO for the purchase of nets, repairs
to smacks, &c. Nearly the whole of the money so
advanced had been promptly refunded, said Mr.
Trevelyan, and his Irish experience had per-
suaded him that the system which worked so satis-
factorily in one place might be j udlciously tried
in another. Yet this same Mr. Trevelyan quar-
relled with chief for proposing, in his Irish
Land Purchase Bill, a grand scheme of State aid
for an impoverished people. The gentleman who
approved of lending £70,000 to some fisherman to
enable them to get a living on the sea, disapproved
of lending £50,000,000 to a whole people to enable
them to get a Jiving on the land. But there Is no
inconsistency in such conduct. Mr. Trevelyan is,
doubtless, true to his principles in objecting to
any Bill which would deprive the wealthy classes
of their dominating power over the soil, and
restore it to its rightful owners. He was not in-
disposed to give a helping hand to the toilers of
the sea, because none of his own class had “ vested
interests ”in the ocean. However, small as might
have been any mercies vouchsafed to the crofters
by Trevelyan, they would have been thankful for
them. Now, we fear, they will have to wait a
while longer before saying “ grace.”
Victoria has won the race for the million
of population. On March 31, she had 1,001,756 in-
habitants, 9881 of whom were added to her as an
Increase for the quarter ending 31st March. This,
too, in spite of our efforts to crowd up N.S.W.,
and our bringing out immigrants by the ship-load,
at the public cost. The younger colony has no
system of state-aided immigration, so that all her
additions to population from abroad have volun-
tarily come to her at their own cost. This seems
to show tnat people who have the means to emi-
grate deliberately choose a colony which is far-
sighted enough to encourage the establishment of
industries within its own borders. No amount of
sophistry from the Preetrade-run mad Sydney
Press can get over this fact. In 1836 Victoria had
a population of 177 souls. An increase of 1,001,579
in 50 years is a solid argument in favour of the
policy of almost the smallest, but by far the most
energetic, Australian colony that will take a lot
of explaining away. At the present moment we
do not know what the population of N.S.W. is,
and the returns will not be made up till the 30th
June. Judging from the lightning-like speed
with which our Government reports are laid be-
fore the public, they may, probably, be published
somewhere about next Christmas. Mr. Hayter’a
return giving full information as to population
up to 31st March is dated 20th April. In it he says:
“N.S.W. will probably have overtaken her sister
in numerical strength by the date named ” (30th
4une). Hut where is the N.S.W. Government
statist? It seems as though we had to depend on
Victoria for information regarding our own
affairs. We have no trustworthy statistics regard-
ing the present state of the colony. In fact, one
of the books which is to be distributed at the
Indian and Colonial show is “N.S.W. in—1881,” a
statistic only live years old. The natural infer-
ence to Englishmen will be that ’Bl is the best year
that N.S.W. can boast.

Won’t Stuart squirm, Bob ?—not at all!
You’d go where they can’t penetrate—
“ gamp ” will paqs you at the gste,
You’re bound to ghine where’er you foam;
With you on favour all will look,
For people really think, at home,
That you discovered Captain Oookl
And, really, though It is not true,
We think, Bob, you believe so too!
THE ACRES AND THE HANDS.
The earth Is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof,
Saith God’s most Holy Word;
The water hath fish, and the land hath flesh,
And the air hath many a bird;
And the soil is teeming o’er all the earth,
And the earth hath numberless lands;
Yet millions of hands want acres,
W hile millions of acres want hands I
Sunlight, and breezes, and gladsome flowers,
Are over the earth spread wide;
And the good God gave these gifts to men—
To men who on earth abide;
Yet thousands are toiling in poisonous gloom.
And shackled with iron bands,
While millions of hands want acres,
And millions of acres want hands 1
Never a foot hath the poor man here,
To plant with a grain of corn;
And never a plat, where his child may dill
Fresh flow’rs in the dewy morn.
The soil lies fallow—the woods grow rankl
Yet idle the poor man stands;
Oh I millions of hands want acres,
And millions of acres want hands!
’Tla writ that “ Ye shall not muzzle the ox
That treadeth out the com I”
Bat, behold I ye shackle the poor man’s limbs,
That have all earth’s burdens borne;
The land is the gift of a bounteous God,
And to labour His Word commands;
Yet millions of hands want acres,
And millions of acres want hands!
Who hath ordained that the Pew should hoard
Their millions of useless gold?
And rob the earth of its fruits and flowers.
While profitless soil they hold?
Who hath ordained that a parchment scroll
Shall fence round miles of lands,
When millions of hands want acres.
And millions of acres want hands!
’Tis a glaring He on the face of day—
This robbery of men’s rights;
’Tis a He, that the Word of the X,ord disowns—
’Tis a curse, that burns and blights I
And ’twill burn and blight, till the People rise,
And swear, while they break their bands,
That the hands shall henceforth have
acres,
And the acres henceforth have hands!

A VARIEGITEDE.
The old Sydney Exhibition Building is
once more to tne fore as a place of amusement. It
Is now a Japanese Village. The last time we went
there It was a Smdan Encampment, at which girls
who smelt of peppermint lozenges pestered you to
buy cardboard cigar-cases at a crown apiece; and
the time before that it was a German Fair. There
was more gloom in both these exhibitions than in
a shipwreck; but for an entertainment which
melancholy had wholly “marked for her own,”
commend us to the show that preceded them—
the "time-honoured Bartlemy Fair.” The per-
formers in that sorry spectacle are all before us
We see again the beery Beadle, the crumpled
Columbine, the sodden “dailor,” and the shivering
“ Swell.” We mind us of the high trapeze upon
which Gonzago was to perform punctually at 3
and 8 daily, but the multiplicity of whose fishing
engagements prevented him ever appearing I in
our ears, even now, are ringing the howls of the
spectators and the curses of the stall-keepers, the
swishing of the rain and the banging of tne gong.
It was a unique entertainment that! For real,
healthy, undiluted amusement, “ viewing a body ”
at a coroner’s inquest was nothing to it.
* • *
But Mr. W. Pemberton Willard has
altered the order of things altogether. He has
brought a show here, which is so full of humours
that it curls you up with merriment every live
minutes. From the time we arrived in Japan
until the moment we took our departure, we
were on the broadest of grins—the whole thing is
so sublimely, yet unconsciously funny. It struck
us, before we had been in Japan long, that the
natives there are poor hands at understanding
their own language. Near the vestibule we en-
countered an elaborate)y-attired Japanese gentle-
man, and wishing to know whereabouts the tea-
nympha were, we addressed him as follows: -
Awi gatno buhi curoo amoy,” but he said “he
didn’t live there; ” similarly when we encountered
him later inside the building, and remarked
cautiously— ‘Shuri bagee cooliah bob,” he said
“he was out.” Likewise, when we treated one of
the native workmen to phrases with a choice
Nagasaki drawl, instead of letting fly in Yoko-
hama’s silvery tongue he would look as if he
didn’t understand, or else murmur something
in a guttural voice, which was not easily under-
derstood, but which evidently signified that he
didn’t want any “ —-tomfoolery.” We did our
best to be conversational, and if we were not suc-
cessful, we can’t help it. We know ours is the
right Japanese, because we got it out of a book.
* * •
Speaking of the Japanese Village, as a
village, it has many peculiarities which at once
strike the observant traveller. You may scan the
shops on both sides of the street as closely as you
can and you will not see the sign of a barber;
neither is there a cook-shop present, nor (fancy b
a public-house. But as it was explained to us
that the village was not nearly finished on the day
of opening, we expect when we go again in a week
or two, to see at least added a barber’s shop and a
restaurant; if not a lock-up and a pub. But
while there is no native depot for refreshment, it
must not be thought that the wants of the hungry
Briton are neglected. Far from it. When we had
been about an hour at the village, it suddenly
struck us tha* - , feeling hungry, we would do
well to order a gaudy but inexpensive collation
composed exclusively ot Japanese dishes. We
proceeded, therefore, to the refreshment depart-
ment, and accosting a timid young woman in
black behind a long counter, we told her we were
hungry, and asked her what she could give us. “ A
meat pie,” she suggested mildly. We sank in a
limp state upon a form. "And, perhaps, you
would like a bottle of ginger-beer ?■’ she said,
in tones that were palpitating but persua-
sive. And she gravely placed these rollick-
ing viands before us, not perceiving that
the sight of the meat-pie curled us all round
the leg of the table. Great Smith I meat-pie .and
ginger-beer—in Japan. Later on, in order to be
revengeful on some one, we told a friend that It
was all right. They hsd got the hang of the
Japanese cuisine. His eyes lit up at this, and he
started off for the long counter. He went up
boldly, and ordered blrd’s-nest soup and toasted
quail, and was seen two minutes later grow.ing
over a bath-bun and a cup of coffee I
♦ ♦ •
To tell the truth, the Japanese Village
doesn’t look half so much like a village as it does
like a bazaar. There is nothing really realistic
about the appointments of it-not even a pump.
We suggested to gentleman connected in some
way with the show that he ought to get signs
up, such as "Walk slowly over crossings,”
or “Trams stop here,” in Japanese, to improve
the illusion, but, strange to say, he received our
remarks with derision bordering upon contumely.
The show consists of two rows of shops which
are as primitive in conception as they are uni-
form in design. They are simply small platforms
spread with blankets and covered in on two sides
with paper. On the platforms the various artizans
and artists work like tailors, seated on as many
folds of blanket as the nature of their labour
allows of, and “ making believe ” to an appalling
extent. But they are no more to be drawn out
than the sea-serpent. There is a man who manu-
factures inlaid sticks there, and while at work on
one of them some wag pointed to it and asktd him
if it were a telegraph-pole. The workman only
looked; he made no reply. As he could not reply
with his loot, he was silent. All this could be read
in one angry flash of his beady black eyes. We
don’t say everybody could read it, mind you; but
we have a turn that way. We don’t know how we
caught it. At Lewis Scott’s lectures, perhaps—or
at the elrcusl Thunderl When Gus at. Leon as
Dick Turpin first sees the pursuing trooper, he
flashes a whole volume with one eye alone, and
keeps the other one in rest on purpose to wink at
the village maidens with.
♦ ♦ *
There was one “mechanical ” (if he can be
so called) who intrigued us greatly. We are in
dined to think he was either the poet or the his-
torian of the party-one or both. Anyhow, he
had a monstrous pile of “ slips ” before him which
he kept gravely pasting on to a huge roll,
which, once "paid our,” would certainly have
peached to Patagonia. We, at once, on having
taken stock of him, endeavoured to strike up an
acquaintance with a brother writer. “ Copy, sir,”
we said, sharply, counterfeiting (not a bit like itl)
the voice ot the printer’s youth. But he didn't
even look up. “Can you give us the first four
slips of the * Royal notice, please?” we enquired.
He glanced up and said something like, “ Lukoord
yo Jo awaya.” We told him we symnathised with
nim, and had been that way ourselver, but he went
on with bis pasting and vouchsafed no other re-
mark. We left him smiling sedately, an-i vaguely
wondered how many millions of lies were wrapped
up ia those thousands ot ixi.es of paper. One
thing we noticid with aso ay. Each man had
before him in bis shop < xqu eite samples of the
work »t which he was all appeared
lobe busy upon the very cot m tenement of the
things they exhibited. This btrvck us at the
painter's particularly. He exhibited some de-
lightful samples, while he wash nnlug butterflies
on waU-paper, some of which r s mbled a hawk,
and some a windmill. But, pertai , t.e waßroserv-
ing his strength for some future oocaslenl

When there is nothing going on up in the
stage, a great attraction is a tea-divan adminis-
tered by three or four Japanese oda'isqu?s
grouped upon a raised platiorm. These gins, it
not alone worth the price of admission, form cer-
tainly an hilarious feature of the entertainment.
They are all habited, elegantly, in the most
fashionable "gowns ’ of their country, colours
varied, but each frock most exquisitely and ela-
borately embroidered They performed in their
stockings, and when you wanted a “cup of tea,”
writhed towards you, somehow, with something in
a little bo *1 about the size of a thrush’s egg slit in
two. This is tea. It is pure whits, and if it tastes
at all, has decidedly the flavour of a teawhosi
ghost has departed, or of a tea that has departed
and left Its ghost behind The ladies are everyone
handsome, and they set-m to erjoy their part of
the performance (treat,ly. They are all smiles and
amiability, and hand round the liliputian goblets
at a surprising rate. Sometimes one plays on the
zither, and then sadness reigns and the tea-drinkers
" get.” We never beard anything sound like tin se
zithers since Fulton organised a Chinese opera
here, and one of the company played a solo on a
banjo, the head of which was only the tize of a
walnut. It’s a pity they let her play, though; she
would be much better employed, while the other
girls are sen- log out the tea, In handing round the
toast.
* * *
The stage is an immense arrangement, the
proscenium of which uprears itself nearly to the
roof. Upon this platform, and upon ropes and
round poles disport themselves a company, the
like of which has certainly not been seen in Syd-
ney. Unless the Japs are up ropss or poles, how-
ever it is difficult, in a general way, to see what
they are about, unless you emulate the example
of tne rest of the company, and stand upon a chair.
You can climb up into the gallery, certainly, and
get a glimpse, but the view you obtain is hazy and
uncertain. To conclude, there Is a great deal of
enjoyment to be got out of the village, and when
you go to Japan, there are two things you can
always depend upon procuring in their purely
native state—we allude to meat pies, and girger-
beer.
The calm, soothing, but still invigorating
effect is peculiar only to Wolfe’s Schnapps. Ask
for Wolfe’s.
One of our judges spoke pretty sharply
the other day about the undue number of com-
mltta’s to higher courts meant to save magistrates
trouble. But those magistrates have a lot of very
unsavoury work, and they cannot go far wrong in
committing doubtful cases to the superior courts.
Juries sometimes give questionable verdicts, and
not always unanimous ones, but if they had to try
the merits of such a business establishment as
Bray Bros, China and Glass Importers, Un-
doubtedly their verdict would be worthy of the
best patronage and support of the general Public.*
Wolfe’s Schnapps is a delightful beverage
as agreeable to the taste as its properties are bene-
ficial to the health.


Newspaper men are about the best judges of a
good drink. They one and all appreciate Wolfe’s
Schnapps.

“Bobadil” was the Easter bill at the
Sydney Opera House, and audiences crowded unto
perspiration greeted its production. It would
hardly be safe to suppose that the Intrinsic merits
of the opera were responsible for this management-
delighting attendance. Most of those present
were agricultural Chesterfields who mash the
guileless cow and innocent jumbuck for 360 days
In the year and devote the remaining five to a wild
attempt at carminating the metropolis. To them,
in choosing a place of entertainment, unlimited
stockings are a sine qua non, and so it happened
this time that the Opera House suited them all to
smash, with perhaps just a little to spare. For
there, we may whisper, these garments are sym-
metrical and bulbous in shape, and gorgeous
beyond all description in brilliancy of hue.
♦ * *
We have described “Bobadil” once or
twice before. The libretto was written by Walter
Parke, Luscombe Searelle, and we should think a
third man (probably J. C. Neild), who discreetl
refuses to permit his name to appear. The best o
it certainly is that contributed by the composer
Mr. Searelle himself. Mr. Parke’s work is fair t
multy. and to the third man the opera is indebtec
for such stuff as this, which we quote from
memory, “ Oh, yes, I know him, his mother usee
to wash for us.” “ Our family have never washed.
‘‘l wonder at that with soap so cheap.” Sue
dialogue as this, of course, make the thing whiz i
the pit, for it serves as a basis of the wit whic
will make the walls of Durand’s-alley and Gordon
place re-echo on some future and festive occasion
bat it is only just to Mr. Searelle's work to say
that in “Bobadil” it seems almost out of place
Yet there are several things in this opera whic i
seem out of place, for it is throughout a strung
combination of incongruous elements. The pa
thetio and the grotesque continually jostle on
another. The sweet sentiment of “Wnere Love
alone is King,” and other lyrics by the composer
accompanies the grotesque business of Moriarity
the pantomimic policeman, the farcical f unnines
of the Armenian Jew, and nigger-minstrel humou
of Schacabac. That the sublime and the rldiculou
must be present in order to make a comic opera
we know well enough: the trouble in this case is
that they do not blend or harmonise. They are
separate and distinct as Abigail and orthography
or Orangeism and Christian charity.
* * *
For all that, “Bobadil” is likely to catch
on to a considerable extent during its six nights
run. The music is soothing rather than inspirit-
ing, and agreeable rather than popular, and the
composer permits it to lose none of its beauty in
Interpretation. Mies Fiaisted makes a brillian;
and melodious princess, and fills the character
with (this is a compliment, mind) her native dia
blerie. Charles Harding clutches the name part
and overcomes it with great slaughter. He took
the same role when the piece was first producec
in November ’B4, but his present performance is
as many miles before, as it is months behind, that
_ representation. Mr. Templeton, owing to the colt I
of the season, spoke and sang as though he hac
half-swallowed a haystack. As to the others, they
did the best they knew how, which, in the case of
Miss Fenton, J. A. South, and Lester was consider-
able, but in other instances really did not amount
to much. "Fantine” follows on Saturday; pre-
parations for it are on an ele-fantine scale of mag-
nificence.
• ft ft «
There is not much to chronicle respecting
the business at the Sydney Royal this issue. “ The
Crimea of Paris ” still holds tne boards there, and
will do so until Saturday in the current week.
Merritt and Conquest will have thus scored a
three-weeks’run before what we may call the
most critical audience in the southern hemisphere.
If anyone disputes our right to designate the
Royal patrons in this style we are willing to let
the phrase go as a quotation from Dion Bouoicault
on the eight he carried away the biggest money.
The sibilant murmur sent in through the mam
entrance in Castlereagh-street by a communica-
tive portion of the proud cohort of superior per-
sons does not appear to have made the triumvirate
sell their clothes and start up country. The great
heart of the people is “their dart,” and they declare
that they have got there with three pair of
grandly-developed hands. They maintain the con-
quest to be owing to merit.
* * *
On Wednesday night next a new English
comedy, called “The Magistrate,” will be pre-
sented. Some home files in speaking of it refer to
It as a farce. The original meanings of words are,
like primitive innocence, difficult to maintain.
Still there is some apprehensible difference be-
tween a farce and a comedy. There is more
tragedy in a farce. A farce makes one laugh more
heartily than a comedy. It is the tragic element
that is the cause of this. However, in a genera-
tion that confounds a fable with an allegory, some
confusion as to the different essences of farce and
comedy must be let pass.
ft ft ft ft
“ Ireland as it Was ” is the title of the
alleged drama now occupying the boards of the
Sydney Olympic. The first thought which this
Piece infallibly suggests is the fervent hope that
Ireland has changed since. If not we have no
sympathy to waste upon its people. The brutal
Sassenach may sit upon them, chaw them up, and
cast them In one huge howling mass into the
deepest part of the Atlantic, and we will join
nands with the brutal and remorseless tyrants,
ana congratulate them on the devastation they
nave wrought. The mau who wrote the piece is
aeaa. We are sure he Is, for pickaxes and the
9JU3- metal are found in every quarter of the
K f°ne. Or if perchance he escaped the wrath of a
rightly rageous nation he must have perished
long since of the wounds inflicted by sharp-
toothed remorse.

At Sydney Academy of Music, the Eeder
Minstrels—but no, we can’t do it. We were goin
to enter into a detailed criticism of their sho
laying on the oleomargarine with a lavish hanc
and using the scalping-knife with generous fer
c lpy» but—-well, the fact la that we haven't be
able to get into the place for the last three nigh
on account of the overpowering, overwhelmin
crowd. Therefore our description of the presen
programme must stand over for a week. And n
know that it is a good one, for when we waitec
tor a tram last Sunday morning at Redfern y
heard the echoes of the Academy hilarity of th
previous night still reverberating around th
columns of the railway station. This latter is
lie, but no matter.

The Sydney Alhambra was again o
Saturday night.choeked full with an appreciate
»?■ c ,* e ®s"f aco d audience. In the minstrelsy par
Minnie Hope, Lucy Frazer, and the classical-fea
tured Matlock came in for most of the ap

followed. Miss Oscar-a very diminutive youn

Hetty Croucher and Shipp sent the dust movin
with dances. Nina Tulioch “ mashed ” the gods
Naylor gave a double-voiced version o
Eileen Alannah,” and Mr. Arthur Reed sang tw
alleged comic ditties. In connection with thi
part of the performance we could not help notic
ing the proneness of some of the members fo
encores, for on more than one occasion when
navvy in the audience made the slightest noise 1
shifting his feet at the conclusion of a song, th
singer came back, bowing and blushing, to give
second edition. The performance concluded wit
the screaming farce, “ Grime’s Will ” (we quot
the bill). There is a tradition that this farce wa
originally played in the Ark, having been special!
written for Noah’s “Mount Ararat Minstrel and
Opera Bouffe Company ” by a celebrated play
wrlght of the antediluvian period. We can’t say
whether there is any truth in the tradition, but w
hope there is, for if the author was with Noah it i
unlikely that he is alive now, and—we don’t wan
to see any more like it.

Mr. G. W. Anson got up to his neck in
glory over in Melbourne. He played in the

Anson attained the loftiest summit of an
actor s ambition when he forced his Excellency to
laugh. We don’t think so much of the aides-de
camp s uproarious merriifaent, because, of course
it Is part of their official business to watch the
countenance of the Gov. Oh these occasions, ant
go one better than he his Excellency had
been In a bilious mood the Herald man migh
have kept his glasses fixed on the box the whole
evening through without detecting the ghost of
simper from anybody. But, anyway, Mr. Anson
scored a grand triumph. The future may have
further bliss instore for him—we hope it has—bul
the epitaph of Mr. A. is, to all intents and pur-
poses, already written: “ He’once made a Gover-
nor laugh.”

It is said,that the Queen has “ commanded’
a performance of “Enemies,” Mrs. Langtry’s
new play. This should go far towards re-estab-
lishing the Lily’s rather rlcketty reputation, for
the very uniqueness of such a command now-a-
oays must glorify the recipient with a halo of
strictest propriety. Mrs. Langtry may have been
singled out for the arduous honour of trying to
amuse the Queen for family reasons. The actress
has been snubbed by the Princess of Wales. A
State show of “ Enemies ” may be intended as a
snub for the Princess, who is not upon the best
of terms with her dread mother-in-law. This
“Enemies” is an adaptation from the French.
The author is Charles Coglan, whose sister Rose

A £25,000 company is being formed to pro-

will be as Interesting as that at Naples and not so

they may feel the Manly aquarium octopus with

It is set down that though Ohiarini wanted
to take his circus to Canton, his agent there
decided that it would not be safe to open to a
crowd of "turbulent natives.” Our opinion is
much the same. Until some new Jokes have been
manufactured for the clowns, “ turbulance ” may
naturally be expected anywhere. For 35 years we
have been asked by the circus- Jesters how we were
the day after to-morrow, and have listened to the
tale of the man being weighed at the restaurant for
a decade. And we think we hear, as we write,
Now Mam’selle Yictorine, what can I got for to
fetch, for to bring, for to carry for you ?” Yes,
Chiarlni is certainly right not to go to Canton: the
Chinamen couldn’t be expected to stand itl

At Her Majesty’s Theatre, London, the
season was terminated rather abruptly by the
refusal of the stage-carpenters to set the scene for
what proved to be the last performance until they
were paid their arrears of salary. The audience
amused themselves by singing “ Wait till the
clouds roll by,” and other ballads of the same
nature. It was impossible to attempt to proceed
with the play, as all, except the “stars,” were on
strike, and after portions of the National Anthem
had been sung the crowd dispersed.

LCorretpondents %eho give neither name nor nom-de-

“ Banjo”: Thanks for offer,'hut we are not
tempted “ W.” : You say, referring to our
leader of last week, that it is not a gross and base-
less libel to assert that ad valorem duties would
demoralise the mercantile community, and ask if
it is reasonable to “ suppose that men, however
really well-meaning, who have been brought up in
an atmosphere of * smart ’ business, can see their
less honest neighbours stealing away their busi-
ness, and not be tempted to get on even terms.”
Do you then believe that our “ merchant princes ’
are felons without opportunity ? That really is
what your argument amounts to. We quite agree
with you that the passing of false entries should be
classed as a fraud punishable with heavy penalties
and not regarded as a slight financial irregularity.
Why a deadbeat should get a month for stealing a
loaf, while a rascally merchant detected in an at
tempt to swindle the State ef thousands gets off
with a fine, which acts merely as a tempta-
tion to try the trick again, is what we
fail to understand “A.J.D.”; Thanks
King Billy ” (re Ireland): We do not “maintain
that any people has a right to demand independ-
ence,” but we do maintain that every dependency
has a right to substantial justice. You say that
Ireland is “ a half-conquered country.” The Irish
must be a wonderful people if all the military out.
rages committed against them, from the sacking
of Drogheda to the “coercion” of Buckshot
Forster, have not amounted to conquest. Now, as
to the North of Ireland. You admit that these
Norther ers would be only a small minority under
Home Buie, and seem to argue that, because that
is the case, the present state of things-acceptable
to the North, but oppressive to the South-should
be continued. To prove your own premises is to
defeat your argument therefrom. If the Orange-
men are in such a minority why should the
majority be oppressed for their sake ? You predict
a civil war because the Orangemen will rebej
against Home Buie. To this the only answer is
that if they rise against their local Government
they must be treated as rebels to it and the
Empire....“J. Sexton”: Every Jew who lends
money usuriously is an enemy of his race. The
Jew has more brains than the so-called Christian,

incur the opprobrium that will ever attach to
usury. ..“Hiram Abiff”: Good; next week....

somebody tell us where Moses was when the light

THE GRAND OLD MAN: "WE PART HERE, HART INGION.”
“The Marquis of Hartington has denounced Mr. Gladstone’s Home Rule Drop, [?] ."—Cablegram to Australian Press.
“The Marquis of Hartington is the eldest son of the Duke of Devonshire, a semi-paralysed nobleman who must soon die, and in succeeding to the Dukedom the Marquis
will come into possession of estates with a rent-roll of £180,000 per annum.”— English paper.
Hon. A. L, Tucker, M.L.A., was up before 1
a Fitr.roy (Melb.) Bench for refusing to “move

Bench dismissed the case. They very properly

meat could ever be expected to “ move on.”

Odds and Ends.
No. 1. It has been announced that “owing to the smallness of the Ball-room at Government House, Sydney, a limited number of invitations to the approaching Ball
Will be sent out.” Well, it must be admitted that some of our aristocracy have rather large feet, but it was a delicate way of putting it, nevertheless, and is another in-
stance of the Governor’s great “tact.” 2. Hiscock’s Minstrels gave a “Sacred Concert” on Good Friday night. Sam Keenan in sacred song! Save the mark! 3. A
Parhamertary Easter Egg. 4. Our artist employed his Easter holidays in making “realistic” studies for Post-office Carvings. (It is not generally known that he has a
commission to replace those which are now the envy of Sir Frederick Leighton, and the butt of the “Constant Reader” humcurisi). 5. From a cablegram received
yesterday, we learn that Mr. A. G. Taylor, our able and popular Member of Parliament, left England with the Orient on Thursday. He comes home to us laden
with the brightest honours that could adorn a politician, etc. —Mudgee Independent. 6. Adelaide telegrams slate that Mr. R S. Aunear,, the manager of the local branch
of the National Bank, has been suspended and arrested under a charge of forgery. A disclosure of defalcations is anticipated, and it is also rumoured that the accounts of
the manager of an institution connected with a religious denomination are about £1000 short, but that, on Christian principles, the matter is to be hushed up. 7. Not-
withstanding the high price of eggs during the Easter holidays, we had a great blow-out at our boarding-house. One egg divided among [?] boarders. 8. Mr. Fronde
says that he never saw a down-cast face in Australia. From which it may be inferred that he never walked through the Sydney Domain. 9. The following extract is
from a report by Mr. Inspector P. R Brett, of Urana, to the Rabbit Branch of the Mining Department:—“Large numbers of cais baye been turned out in this district,
but are not doing much towards destroying the rabbit pest. When the cats become wild, as they coin a very short time, they seem to prefer birds to any other food, Last
week rabbits and eats were found near here, living together in a large heap of posts. On looking over the place I found remains of birds only.” Intermarriage between
the two species is next on the cards with interesting Darwinian developments. 10. Roughing it at the Easter Encampment. Easy chairs, carpets, electric lights, tele-
phones, Shades of Wellington, Napoleon, and General Jackson! Do you call that roughing it?

mother-country might make it rather indistinct at present, but when he saw that shadow gradually becoming more definite, and observed certain retired colonists now resi-

The Sydney Echo says that all the re-
ligious denominations in Adelaide, excapt the
Anglicans and Roman Catholics, observed Sunday
week as a day of humiliation on account of com-
mercial depression. As our humiliation, like our
commercial depression, is chronic, and we hap-
pened to b a reoaid an old debt on Saturday we
postponed our “ humiliation ” till to-day, and have
to confess that we were carnal enough when tha
roast-beef and plum-pudding came steaming in
from a godless baker’s shop, we were, not to put
too fin* a fork into it, carnally hilarious. Needless
to say we have nothing for to-morrow. We will
back ourselves, however, to humiliate beyond
recognition if somebody will promise to send

some of them are not particularly satisfied even

As a rule we look to the Gundagai Times
for an opinion on difficult subjects «uch as the
Irish question, Imperial Federation. &o We are
all at sea this week. We have hunted through the
issue of April 30 until we are tired. However,
there is one item which might be read w'th inte-

—“A German test for watered milk consists in
dipping a well-polished knitting-needle into a

drawing it in an upright position. If the milk be

but tne addition of even the smallest portion of
water will prevent the adhesion of the drop.” We

We have nevpr seen that, devotional little

screams which caused those who resided in the

. The promoters of the Mysore (India) Gold-
miPlnA?°-vwho are tr y iQ s to get a cool million
out of the London public, have some good friends
on the English Press. A London weekly, for in-
stance. tells us that “the Oriental tale la not a fable
—the secret treasure-house of Aumngzebe, the
spot whence he and others derived their wealth,
the caverns of Ormuz and Ind, have been dis-
covered by the patient, plodding directors of the
Mysore gold mine.” The London public will likely
swallow this yarn, which relates to a "resoeotable”
country, Hindostan, the “ East Indies.” But If the
Day Dawn, or Mount Morgan, or the Long Tunnel,
or any ether first-class Australian mine were put
on the English market to-morrow, the public
would be incredulous, and the brokers, before
undertaking to sell a share, would want 50- per
cent, of the capital by way of commission.

The wits fairly run riot in northern
N.S.W. At the East Maitland banquet to Lord
vaiingtou, one eloquent membab, in allusion to
the fair sister of Lady Carlngton, said: “ I do hope
■he may be Harboured here,” which, as the young
lady’s family call themselves “Hubbard,” was
quite a distressing pleasantry. ‘“I am sadly
afraid,” remarked another genius, “ the ladies of
West Maitland will all become Benedicts.”
Ladies, you who are married and whose
husbands are exposed to the disturbing it fluenoes
inseparable from a business life—be sure you keep
a dog upon the premises. It may save you much
unnecessary suffering. We are thinking of Edward
Jones, of West Melbourne, while we write. Elward
returned home the other afternoon worried and
out of sorts. Furthermore, Edward was drunk.
He did as most men do under such trying circum-
stances—smashed the crockery and threatened to
“finish” the missus. And, ladies, there is little
doubt that Edward would have finished his wife
If he hadn’t relieved his feelings by strangling the
dog. The faithful four-footed creature was the
indirect means of saving the life of its mistress.
Now you perceive the bearing of this paragraph.
When he comes home mad and the work of de- ]
struotion commences, whistle for the dog. Perhaps
it would be as well to keep two or three dogs j
about the premises.
The Rockhampton Evening Mercury is 'j
just starting on a new career or usefulness. The
paper has broken the old syndicate, sacked the
old editor, and repented of the misdeeds of the
past. It has also laid in a large stock of assorted
principles for its future guidance, and Is going to
make things whiz In Central Queensland. Before
bidding farewell to its former evil courses, how- j
ever, it does a burst of penitence In its leading i
column, illustrated by the following touching
episode in the life of the writer:-* When a child
he misconducted himself, whereupon his father. I
remonstrating with him, brought forth peniten- '
tlal tears coupled with a confession of guilt, con-
trition, and sorrow, combined with anneals for ,
forgivece ts. and vows of determination to reform, j
Then the tender embraces of an affectionate j
mother re-assured our yotthful mind and ei-
kindled a flame of affection never to bo forgotten, 1
influencing our whole life and actions.” What a
prig I The general impression in the North is that
the * Mercury’s father should have soundly
spanked that youthful journal, and locked it up
on bread and water for a fortnight. But what
causes the most overwhelming surprise Is that the
Evening Mercury should have had such a rela-
tive at all. The general impression was that -
It never 1 had a father,
And it never had a mother.
But on mouldy Scotch pease brose,
It was dry-nursed by its brother.
However, It now appears that the father < xists,
and be has spared the rod and spoiled the Mer-
cury. Having thus roused public curiosity as to
his early carter, the journalist feels called upon to
give further particulars, which he does as follows:
—‘‘By a combination of circumstances the Mer-
cury was engendered and brought forth. Two
months ago, this production was born, and now it
Is our painful duty to confess that the thing has
been neither more nor less than an abortion from
the commencement to the present time. We there-
fore, with humility, apologise for the wlahey-
washey hash that has hitherto been served up
from our office. Truly we have been an organ
without any definite sound. Wo have seen our
error, and moreover, be it distinctly understood,
are determined to remedy it; on this we stand or
fall” Here, again, local opinions differ. The
Mercury desotloes Itself at one and the same
time, as a thing, an abortion, and a dumb organ
two months old; where the general impmSßion is,
that it is not an organ at all. but a fiddle with one
string. However, taking It at its own valuation,
it is evident ihls abortive organ has got titnnrto

There are some very fanny aldermen down
at Hay (N.S.W.) When it was known there that
the Jenniogs-Robertson camps could not form a
Mini,try, these aldermen wired to Lord Carington
offering to come to Sydney to rua the Govern-
ment for him. At least this Is said to have been
the purport of the wire, but as the oouncll-blerk
left the book outside the safe one night, the press-
copy of the message was torn out. We would like
to see the aldermen who were moved to make this
historic offer. They doubtless thought that as they
had proved their ability to make the llttle boys
and goats of Hay grovel In abject terror before
them, the same qualities would avail to steer the
country out of its financial difficulties, and make
things sing all round. And their modesty was not
less than their overwhelming self-confidence, for
they did not offer to become per r etual Premiers
and eternal Treasurers—they only offered to clutch
the portfolios until his Excellency could get other
advisers. History does not show a nobler or more
self-sacrificing offer than that of the Hay alder-
men, and the annals of the known world do not
show a more startling exhibition of unbounded
impudence. This offer must afford much satlsfac-
tion to the Governor. When the present Ministry
retires, far from being harassed by the need of
advisers he can just bring up fhe aldermen of Hay
in a cattle-waggon, and await the formation of
another Ministry with the utmost complacency.
Or if these Hay men lappen to be busy with the
shearing there is no reason why councillors should
not be drawn from elf e * here. We have no doubt
whatever that tbe Mayor of Marulan, and the
council clerk of Blllyramblga, would willingly ac-
cept the billets of Premier and Vice-pnsideat of

CUPID'S VICTORY.
“ The victory is mine,” quoth she;
“ He loves me-that I Enow;
Heart-free am I, and joy to see

“ She loves me—that is plain;
I’m quite heart-whole and sport ’twill be

Universal [use and popular approval have
indissolubly established the fame of Wolfe's
Schnapps.
The Federal Coffee Palace Company,
Limited.— l his company has now got fairly to
work; prize designs for one of the most magnificent
buildings on this side of the world have been ac-
cepted, and after some little delay in consequence
of a dispute as to which architect should be employ-
ed to carry out the design, operations have been
commenced. Messrs. Bllerker, Kilhurne, and Pitt
have been entrusted with the work, and Mr. D’Bbro
who threatened to enforce his claim to the position
in the law courts, has amicably settled it in such a
way as will not entail any cost upon the Company.
The contract for the first portion of the building
has been let to Mr. Kingston, wno was the builder
of the palace In Bourke-street, for something un-
der £10,000, the excavations for the basement
apartments are completed, and the working draw-
ings for the superstructure are being pushed for-
ward with all possible despatch. In order to
provide ample funds tor the completion of the
building according to the design, the directors have
determined to offer the balance of the unallotted
shares to the public, upon the same terms as those
originally issued, namely, -me shilling ner share
up m application, one shilling and sixpence per
snare on allotment, and two shillings ana sixpence
per share at interva s of three mouths u. til ten
shillings is paid up. Within a week of this being
announced to the shareholders 3155 share) were
applied or, and the public, as well as the original
shareholders, are now ffered the opportunity to
secure them upon the same terms. I’he large pre-
mium which tue shares ot other coffee Pal ces are
bringing is the best possible ptoot that such in-
stitutions meet the approval and satisfy a want
which is felt in the community. The site which
this company has spoored is an excellent position
for securing the trade it will cater for. The ener-
getic secretary, Mr. James Mirams, is supported by
an able directory of business meu, of whom the
Hon. John Nimmo, the Minister of Public Works,
is chairman; and with the j udgment and care which
these gentlemen are devoting to the undertaking,
there should be little doubt of its successful ac-
complishment.
The exceptional increase in the sale of Wolfe'S
Schnapps may be attributed to its marked superi-
ority over other Spirits. „
PEPPER AND SALT.
There is a mildly amusing incongruity
between the concluding: line of the following
obituary advertisement, which appeared in the
Melbourne Age, and the three lines that precede
it:-
‘ The mistakes of my life have been many,
The sins of my youth still more;
And I scarce can see for weeping.
But I’ll knock at the open door.”
There are, no doubt, many bereaved persons who
wp be glad to obtain a variation on this. We give
it freely, for w* have always had a soft spot ii our
hearts for those who mourn and will not be com-
forted. Attend;
I’m the worst of sinners, you bet, sirs,
But I snap my fingers at fate;
I'm steeped in crime to the eyebrows.
Yet I'll hang at the gallen gate!

CUHTAIN,
Dear Sir William, we would whisper, still so gently
in your ear,
That the mau who wants to lubricate will al vays
have his beer;
Be it Sunday, be it Monday, be It morn or noon, or
night,
Any man who feels Inclined to will undoubtedly
get tight;
And not all tbe traps and watchers between Beer-
sheba and Dan,
Could, amongst them, ever circumvent a really
thirsty man ;
He who wants his drop of poison with a head, Or
cold without,
Will not only oil his flute himself, but for hi 8
neighbour shout,
And the only way to keep men straight in “Aus-
tral's sunny clime,”
Is to pass a law to keep pubs, open nearly all the
time.

Sine© poor J.B. departed.
And still our weeping eyes are red,
For still we’re broken-hearted.
When scorching sun rays melt us down.
Or wintry wind® blow chilly,

The faithful, well-fed gillie.
We wonder if he plays and sings
An endless round of praises,
And flys about on snowy wlnga
Or—lf he’s gone to blazes I
A POEM OF PARR AMATTA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though this ballad has some of the true Smithfleld
ring,
Not the martyrs of old is the theme that we
sing,
Of a far later Latimer this lay will be,
And of bold M Namara and Gilllver Gee.
Twas the Sabbath in wild Parramatta. The park
Was o’ercrowded with citizens on for a “lark,”
Who had gathered in hope some excitement to tee
’Twixt the bold M Namara and Gilliver Gee.
For the daring freethinker was going to prove
That ’twas all in his eye about Infinite Love,
That the story of Genesis could not well be,
Never counting at all upon Gilliver Gee.
M’Namara set down as a Biblical fib
The whole snrgical story of Eve and the rib.
From which fact you will readily gather that he
Was a different hairpin from Gilliver Gee.
M‘Namara was held to hold frivolous views
Of the life of the wonderful God of the Jews;
Views that would not, ’twas hinted, be found to
agree
With the sturdy opinions of Gilliver Gee.
M’Namara, ’twas said, all the church rites des-
pised—
It was whipered in awe that he'd not been bap-
tised,
That he did not believe in the snake and the tree
With the hearty endorsement of Gilliver Gee.
M‘Namara bad notions, ’twas bruited abroad
That our duty to man was much mor than to
God-
Tbat thera was no great terror hereafter to flae—
He’d never yet hearkened to Gilliver Gee.
Then the bold M'Namara straight mounted a seat,
And proceeded at once the huge audience to treat
To bis version of all that has been, or will be—
Silent scorn stamped the visage of Gilliver Gee.
For awhile he proceeded—though many a yell
Rent the air—to discourse ah out Heaven and Hell;
“Can such things be allowed? Can such blas-
phemy be ?
I'll arise to confute it,” said Gilliver Gee.
Which he did. And we learn from a lucid report
Of tbe evidence given next day at the court
He was hustled by that bad agnostic, though Tie
Strongly swore he was hustled by Gilliver Gee,
And the mob roared aloud—" To the river with
hlml ”
“Lotus duck him I” “ Lvt’s drown him? ” “Let’s
see can he swim I ”
But, as names are not mentioned, men do not
agree
Which was meant-the Agnostic or Gilllver Gee.
But the brave sub-inspector, hight Latimer, then
Took a hand in the game with hla resolute men.
And conveyed this Tom Paine to the lock-up,
where he
Was detained for assaulting one Gilliver Gee.
And next morning, for doing the things that he
did,
He was eased by the Bench af a couple of “ quid,”
Which amount has been gained by the Queen’s
Treasuree
Through the sole i iterfereaoe of Gilllver Gee.
Let whoever has doubts about canons or creeds
Think of this—no man having a faith built on
reeds
Could have won in tbe end go completely as he—
This new Oliver Cromwell—stout Gilllver Gee.
And, henceforward, we're not going to throw up
our hat
About Darwin or Spencer, or such stuff as that;
But, remembering the flae, bow full lowly the
knee,
To the winning religion of Gilliver Gee.

Here Is yet another advertisement from
the Age: “Dear Harry,—Things are changed on
your part. Remember this Wednesday morning
six weeks. No change in me. H.” Helghol play
that dear old air, “ Ben Bolt,” upon the office har-
monium, and we’ll address a verse:—
TO HARRY.
Don’t you remember that morning six weeks,
That morning six weeks what you did—
How you smoothed her fair tresses and patted
her cheeks.
As her face on your shoulder she hid;
But now yon have found a fresh girl, dear boy—
Fresh tresses to smooth and caress;
Along with a score of dead passions, or more,
That other lies buried, we guess.
Along with score of dead passions, or more,
That other lies buried, we guess.
Don’t you remember the vows that you made,
You whispered ’em Into her ear—
You swore she should never have cause to up-
braid,
And the simpleton thought you sincere;
But though there’s no change in her heart, dear
boy,
It in vain reciprocity seeks,
For your is a rose that buds, blossoms, and blows
Within the short space of six weeks.
For yom’s love Is a rose that buds, blossoms, and
blows.
Within the short space of six weeks.

The valedictory report of the retiring
president of Melbourne Chamber of Commerce
say tnat “the commercial barometer testifies to
the uninterrupted • fair weather “ enjoyed by Vic-
toria for the last two or three years Notwith-
standing the depression in N S.W. and S.A., trade
in Victorla has been sound, the manufactories
have not been idle, and the industrial classes have
been making good wages.” Yet Victoria is a
protectionist coloay.
From the Gunredah (N.S.W.) Advertiser :
-“A meeting of the Athletic Club was held at
Maher’s Hotel on Wednesday night for the pur-
pose of boycotting the advertiser ; and Bill
Pritchard, the leader of the Maitland-street
contingent, was In great form. He was sup-
ported by the Cohen boys and one or two
others specially pressed into the service.” We
regret to say we are in a deep study at present
over the probable outcome of Gladstone’s Mid-
lothian campaign, but we promise to deal with
this Bill Pritchard ana the Cohen boys in a drastic
fashion shortly-say 33ad April, 1900 a.d. The case
is urgent.
A London governess was recently sent to
prison on half-a-dozen charges of stealing, to
which she pleaded guilty, and it will be gratifying
to those in search of instructors for their children
to learn that “It was stated that her friends had
made arrangements for her to go to Australia
when she became free.” And it was only the
other day that we sent up a newly-arrived gover-
ness to a friend in the country. We presented her,
at the railway station, with a bundle ot sausage-
sandwiches. and handed her in her umbrella. It
struck us then that it was tolerably weignty, but
we attributed tnat circumstance to the fact that
she had probably wrapped up in it some portion
ot her possessions—a dinger sewing-machine, or a
dog. But now a horrible conviction has taken
possession ot us. It was a crowbar!
There is a good story from New London
(U.S.), of a man named Jerry Jones eating 10J
smelts for a wager in 17 minutes. On pocketing
the stakes he then, for a consideration, offered to
Immediately devour a dozen boiled eggs I This
reminds us that the N.S.W champion porridge-
eater, Mr. Bibby, seems to have faded from the
public gaze. If he turns up again, a match might
oe made between him and the Yank for, say, a
mad dog aside. The interest in such an exhibition
would be very great here; and influence might be
brought to bear upon his Excellency to give (he
being a mighty sportsman) his patronage to the
entertainment. On the whole, ho wever, we hardly
think with Bibby in it that the match coula come
to anything. It would be almost certain to
be found tnat Bibby was so anxious to “up-
hold the honour of New Soutn Wales ” that
he had eaten his mad dog before the show began.
We have received a neat little volume,
entitled “ How to Play the Piddle: Hints to Be-
ginners.” No doubt these are compiled judiciously
for the guidance of such fiends in human clothes
as may be desirous of ecraping the tall of the horse
against the innards of the cat for the torture ot
their fellow-men. Our own Hints to Beginners
are es follows:-!. Lock yourself up in an under-
ground cellar in some distant land, somewhere
where cholera is raging for choice. 3. Take the
violin firmly In the left nand and place a medium-
sized chopper in the grasp of tne right. Bring the
cnopper down violently on different portions of
the instrument at intervals ot two seconds until
it is totally unrecognisable. 3. Light a coal fire.
Place the bow of the fiddle on the most lurid por-
tianofthe same, and then dance In front of it.

across your throat.

On Good Friday night Mr. C. Huenerbein
gave the first of his series of concerts in the
Masonic Hall. The audience was fairly big, but
had Mr. Huenerbein been able to include the
fashionable piece de resistance in the programme,
viz , the Governor and suite, it would doubtless
have been much augmented. Everybody looked
properly gloomy as became the night, Mr. C. Hard-
ing in his black kid gloves being specially funereal
in appearance, whilst both Mbs Christian and Miss
Riley wore black gowns, which were certainly
made to look rich and handsome, the one with
rich bugle trlmmiog and the other with a dash of
deep crimson satin shimmering through the black
net. It is quite wonderful how little encourage-
ment Mr. Huenerbein has met with in his
laudable enterprise in bringing Miss Christian
over from Melbourne to assist at the concerts.
We have not so many good singers here that we
can afford to lose the chance of hearing one of
Miss Christian’s reputation, and yet on Saturday
night the audience was meagre indeed. On Friday
night Mr. Harding made a decided hit by his sing-
ing of Delaney’s sacred song, and was pressed
very hard for an encore, which he, with commend-
able taste (ail things considered) declined. Miss
Christian was at her best in the “ Evening prayer, ’
from Costa's Eli, but the audience was unaccount-
ably cold. Mrs. Riley sang sweetly, as usual, but
Mr. Halleweli, who had just got the first instal-
ment of a severe cold, which has grown worse
ever since and prevented his further appearance
atlthese concerts, was w ell, he wasn t as good
as usual, but that isn’t saying that he wasn’t
worth listening to. Mr. ailpregs played a violin
solo (sacred) with nice tone and expression, and
the concert terminated with a duet from “ Stabat
Mater,” capitally sung by Miss Christian and Mrs.
Riley. These concerts were certainly worthy of
better patronage than they received.

Randwiok Racecourse presented a most
attractive picture on Easter Monday, when the
beauty and fashion of Sydney and Melbourne were
well represented. Lurd and Lady Carington,
accompanied by the Hon. Judith Haibord, Cap-
tain Gascoigne, Captain Terry, and Mr. Walling
ton, were present the greater part of the day.
Lady Carington a dress was ot thin sil t ot a
peculiar pinky shade, with an intricate pattern,
and trimmed with a darker shade of satin. The
Hon. Miss Harbord looked well in ivory-tinted
cashmere, with a narrow vest of white; Mrs. F. M.
Darley wore handsome black; Mrs. J. O. Inglis (of
Melbourne) donned a green plush and satm cos-
tume, slightly relieved with old gold; Mrs. Cecil
Griffith wore an extremely pretty gown, the skirt
of dark slate velvet, with bodice and draperies of
velvet stripe; Miss Ciara Manning in green velvet
with white satin vest; Mrs. Wrench, in very hand-
some black gros grain, heavily trimmed with jet;
the Misses Throckmorton, small dotted black
surabs, black tube bonnets with grey and white
doves; Mrs. M’Quade, apricot ottoman cord richly
trimmed with lace and pale green; Mrs. Septimus
Stephen, in a costume of brown; Miss George, in
fawn; Miss Myra Kemble, in an elegant tailor-
made gown of grey tweed. There were a few
plush mantles seen, but the day was too warm tor
such garments to be worn all day.

| [Christ Church, South Tarra, was the scene
of a quiet wedding on tne 15th inst., when Mr.
Chas. J. hojle, ot Bond-street, Sydney, was united
to Miss Emily Betnla Shaw, of Meloourne. The
bride was attired la travelling dress of dark blue
navy serge, and looked most attractive. Two
bridesmaids were in attendance—Miss May Shaw,
the bride s sister, and Miss Daisy Hewitt, her niece,
both of whom were dressed very handsomely.
After the ceremony had been performed, the wed-
ding party, to the number of about 39, met at the
residence of Mr, Raynes Dickson, at Arnside,
where the health of tue newly wedded pair were
honoured, and shortly afterwards the happy
couple started for the Gippstand Lakes amidst the
usual showers of rice, old shoes, and good wishes.

My Dear Belle,— Now that the pious part of
Easter is over we can breathe freely, and enjoy
our lives once more—that’s to say as much as it is
possible under existing circumstance", for our
homes are almost completely un-manned, Port
Hacking, Lord Howe’s Island, and various other
§ laces being responsible for our forsaken con-
Ition. What glorious weather they have had for
the encampment! It isn’t a bit like Easter, but
how much pleasanter it must be playing at soldiers
in the brilliant sunshine, than In the pouring rain
as of yore. It will give the “ soldiers ” quite a
taste for camp life, I should say, and they will
return to us with only a half sort of gladness, and
will resume the duties of their comparatively
prosy lives with but an ill grace; I may be wrong,
of course, but these are my fears.
The long-talked-of Japanese Village at the Ex-
hibition building is now a real thing, and on
Saturday, the opening day, we paid it a visit, and
were really entertained by all we saw. I can't
say as much for all we heard, for our ears have
not as yet been educated up to Japanese music.
A Japanese lady played an instrument something
like a Chinese fiddle, and a tiny boy played a drum
accompaniment, the combination of sound having
p eoisely the same effect as that issuing from the
kitchen when cook is in a tantrum, and, in order
to give vent to her feelings beats her eggs very
1 >ud and mutters complaints in a raspy voice all
the time. It is intensely monotonous, but very
likely the Jap’s ears were just as unappreciative
of the nice selections Patek’s band gave us at
Intervals, though it’s so hard for us to realise such
a thing. There are shops arranged all round the
building where oue can not only purchase articles,
but in most cases can see them manufactured.
For instance, at one stall two J apanese women (one
of them possessing ths loveliest and glossiest black
hair) are busied in making those oualnt-looking
birds we have fastened amongst our drawing-room
curtains, suspended from our chandeliers, and
perched on various brackets. We went round to
the tea-stall and were offered a cup of hot water.
Now, I am told that hot water is one of the most
wholesome things to drink just before a meal, but
excellent as it is, 1 should prefer to call it by its
own name and not tea. These amiable Japanese
ladies (they all look amiable) seemed quite disap-
pointed when their hospitality seemed so little
relished, but persisted in offering the hot water all
the same. At first I thought it was a kind of
colourless tea, so just tasted it to make sure, but
it was just as devoid of flavour as colour,
and I am very much afraid these foreign
ladles were having a joke at our expense. On a
small platform a juggler performs some rather
clever tricks, and 1 couldn’t help noticing what a
very large part a fan plays in a Jap.’s life. It
seems part and parcel of him; even his tricks
seem unfinished unless be fans them—it’s a fact,
though it does seem ridiculous. 1 came away
without knowing more than half this funny little
village, but it was enough to digest for one day,
and I shall look forward to spending another
afternoon there this week with much pleasure.
Such a delicious scheme for beautifying a house
on festive occasions has emanated from the brain
of a Mrs. Mason, an American lady. She lately
gave a grand bail in Philadelphia, and bad all the
wiadow-drapings removed, and curtains of aspara-
gus vines, Intertwined with the beautiful jacque-
not roses substituted. The landings of the stair-
ways were turned into floral bowers, and Mrs.
Mason received her guests in the shadow of a
mass of ferns in front of the ball-room. Even the
elevator was hidden in roses, and the mere cost of
the flowers for the season was £l4O It seems a-big
sum Just for flowers, does it not? but then the
effect must nave been exquisitely lovely. • I
wonder if there will be any unusual display at our
first big Carington ball, which is soon to come off I
A Maitland friend writes me that Lady Caring-
ton s reception held in West Maitland was the
attraction of all the feminine loveliness in the
town. Lady Carington wore a simple grey nuns’
veiling trimmed with white lace, and with just a
touch of pale pink in her bonnet; Miss Harbord
also wore grey, and a brown velvet jacket. Mrs.
John Eales, who was attired in a sage-green cos-
tume, presented Lady Carington with a Small
basket of white roses, dahlias, and ferns cut from
the famous Duckenfleld garden. The Maitland
people seem to have been well pleased with their
visitors, though some of them lost their heads a
bit, and were rather oppressively fussy. My cor-
respondent rather cruelly observes that at the
time of the vice-regal visit several aboriginals
were in the town whose behaviour was far more
dignified than that of many of their sycophantic
pale-faced brothers. Maitland is certainly not
singular in the possession of such toadies. One
only needs to live in Sydnev a very short while in
order to find that out. - ,
We are all sorely distressed about this second
fearful Llthgow colliery disaster which has left so
many families fatherless and destitute. Several
laoles in Sydney are attempting to start a fund
for the benefit of the widows and orphans
1 hope yours will not be a small mite, de*r,
for, remember, some of these poor things actually
haven’t money to buy the bare necessaries of life.
Wear your gloves a few inches shorter all through
the season, and by so doing you will save enough
to help a whole family for a week, I should ima-
gine. I see Mr. C Huenerbein generously
offered half the proceeds of his Tuesday after-
noon’s concerts in the Town Hall for the benefit
of the fund, but whether the proceeds amount to
much I can’t tell, as I was unable to attend the
concert. Sydney people are, as a rule, kind-
hearted, but they love not afternoon concerts.
The School of Industry ball comes off next
week, and, as Lord and Lady Carington have pro-
mised to attend, it is likely to be a big event.
Several of my girl-friends have been planning
their dresses for weeks past, so it is to be hoped
the results will justify so much expenditure of
time, money, and anxiety. But it often .happens
that the simpler a dress is the more effective. And
did you ever notice what a penchant men have for
cotton dresses ? I remember when cousin Dorrle
came to spend a season in Sydney she was highly
incensed because Ned asked her as a favour to
“ wear one of her pretty blue cotton morning
gowns to the club ball instead of one of those
crusbable gauzy tnings Mab is so fond of wearing.”
She abused him soundly for his crass ignorance on
the subject of dress and declared she would rather
die than oblige him in that matter. But he stuck
to his opinion that she couldn’t possibly look,
prettier tnan she did in a bright, fresh cotton dress,
but as nobody knows better than yourself, Bede,
that no amount of compliments will induce us to
defy the rules of fashion, I needn't tell you Ned
didn t get his way about the “blue cotton gown,”
as he called it.
Yes, dear, you must have at least three of your
winter costumes tailor-made, in which to make
your appearance in Melbourne, or you will run
the risk of being dubbed a simple country know-
nothing, and that would refl ot on me, seeing that
I am supposed to keep you posted up in such
matters; so, now, don’t forget. It seems that a
fashionable West End tailor can afford to pick and
choose his customers, those Udles who are the un-
fortunate possessors of tub-iike or angular figures
being declined with thanks, as doing little or no
credit to his establishment. Just imagine a tailor ,
of all men, being so fastidious I
Talking of dresses and so forth reminds
me that lately at a '.fashionable wedding in
Exeter the officiating clergyman actually stood
up in the pulpit and rebuked that part of the
company who had flocked to the church “simply
to see what could be produced by the manufac-
tory of art and the dressmaker's skill.” Well now,
it appears to me that that same parson quite over-
stepped bis duty in finding fault with these harm-
less people. We all love to look upon things beau-
tiful, and what possible mischief can be done by
indulging in this innocent amusement? I don’t
like judging a man harshly, but it’s just possible
this same clergyman had receive 1 a smaller fee
than he expected—hence his ill-tempered and ill-
timed censuring of the astonished congregation.
Ah, well, clergymen arc but human after all.
Since the language of flowers is nearly played
out. what do you think is being utilised to express
our feelings to each other ? Nothing less than
sealing-wax Red wax must only bi used for
sealing business letters, whilst black is, of course,
reserved for mourning correspondence, but blue -
now listen to this—is s'gniflcant of love, and five
tints of various blueness are now manufactured,
so that each stage of the tender passion may have
its corresponding coloured wax. But I am
wondering how we are to know when we have
arrived at the different stages, and how we are to
learn what particular shade of blue belongs to
that stage—when we get there. Pjrhaps some-
body will kindly print a pamphlet on the subject.
But wait, I haven't finished yet about the wax.
Pink is used exclusively for sealing letters of con-
gratulation, whilst for weddings and balls nothing
but pure white ii permissible. Variegated or
mottled wax is understood to express conflicting
emotions on the part of thes 3 using it.
I hiarthe Melbourne ladies are going to follow
our example and form a ladies' cricket club
next season, notwithstanding the assertion made
lately by a Melbourne scribe that the Melbourne
ladies prefer to cultivate the arts whlht we in-
cline to mwcle. Too bad that, isn’t it ? but as it
isn’t true it doesn’t hurt us Well, if the Mel-
bournltcs do imitate us about the the cricket it's
to be hoped they will exercise their superior and
artistic brain-power and invent something sensible
in the way of costumes Crinolines were ever un
graceful, but upon the cricket field are simply
grotesque, and, save lor helping to stop a ball oc-
casionally, areterrib'v in the way. I never yet
saw a girl tun gracefully or swlitly, handicapped
by a crinoline. lam afraid there is nothing for It
but the divided skirt after all.
I heard a gentleman on the railway station say
to one of the guards this morning, with just the
slightest touch of sarcasm in his voice—” Hi,
guard, what time does the 10 20 train start ? ” The
guard, who was evidently an Irishman, replied in
the gravest manner, “At 11 o’clock, sir.” But at
holiday time everything seems to be turned topsy-
turvy though why it should be so I’m sure I can’t
tell. But after ail, irregular as the trains some-
times are, and dirty as the trains always are, what
should we do without them ? We really ought
to be more thankful for small mercies, but we are
nothing if not grumblers. Hoping you are enjoy-
ing your holidays,
Your ever loving
MAB. !

YE TERRIBLE TALE OF YE SHOPGIRL, AND

Belinda Brown was her name, and she was a
bride of 13 months and a day. We wiah to be par-
ticular with this chusk of imformation, because,
as Garden Honey would say, Tempus fugit, and
moment by moment the days grow short* r with
usali. The truth of this assertion may not burse
on our readers in full bloom at once, but it will
gradually grow upon them in a style that cannot
be forgotten. To return to our mutton, however,
Belinda Brown had a voice that could bore a hole
in a seven-inch plank, and snorted louder than the
snore of a Ministerial stonewaller when an Oppo-
sition member is doing a speii of "stonewalling ”
Selina Smith was the shop-girl’s name, and she
sang in the same choir as the blastiferous Brown,
but she had an organ so sweet that she could coax
down sparrows off a telegraph line to listen to it.
Consequently the e was a North Pole coolness be-
tween the pair. By some strange, and wholly un-
accountable means, it came to Belinda’s 6x4 ears
that the summer shopping season had " arrove.”
It was the festive season when nothing but the
bob-tail top knot of the calico elerkess is seen
above the festive shop-keeper’s board, and tower-
ing pile of mousseline de lalnes, and pates-de-foie-
gras, and the liar, cause the miliiaery counters to
groan beneath ttulr jackass loads, when Belinda
trooped into the emporium in whica Selina was
engaged, and after giving her silvery-throated
rival a ton of trouble looking for something "just
a shade lighter," was hauled up short by Selina’s
delicate hint: “I would try this remnant if I were
you, Mrs. Brown— it hides the dirt so admirably.”
Bare wretch thou diest in one act to hurdy-gurdy
music, ’ exclaimed Belinda, and then stabbing
Belinda fatally dead with a hm pm she strangled
herself with her own garter, anu being rich, died

BY FLOOD AND FIELD.
The Intercolonial eight-oar race, rowed on
Victorian waters on Saturday last, needs very little
description. Ihe Victorians, pulling: a less num-
ber of strikes than their opponents on the long:
slides, drew away from the start, and won as they
liked by some eight lengths in 18min.
Though individually the cornstalks were tne oest
crew that has yet represented N.S.W., they were
so humbugged in their training and fltting-up
that had they been Beaches and Mattersons the
result would in all probability have been the same.
The first mistake was, as we strongly pointed out
at the time, in having Brett as coach, a selection
which speaks very poorly for our rowing men,
and if it was really thought Brett was the only
man in the colony competent to coach the crew it
would have been far better to have put another
man in the boat, and thus allowed G. B. to confine
his attention wholly to the coaching. Brett took
his place in the bow, with the object of watching
the men in front of him, and this upset the crew
when he took his place aft; but the demon still pur-
sued them, and coach had, later on, to move back
to number three for the stated reason that the new
boat trimmed by the stern. Then a still more
grave mistake was made in placing George Seale
number seven in the final fixing. For pluck and
staying power Seale is second to none in the boat,
but as an accomplished oarsman be must make
way to N. Johnson, who should undoubtedly have
rowed seven, as he is not alone a lighter man than
Seale (and we understand weight forward was the
object of the change), but he is more used to row-
ing behind his clubman Bros, at all times a most
erratic puller. Then there was the change from
short to long slides, and poppet heads to swivels.
We believe with Brett, that the change is a good
one, provided the men are educated up to it,
but to pitchfork a crew a few weeks before a race
into a boat fitted up in the new style was very
properly looked upon by boating men as fatal to
the chances of a win by the N.S.W. crew. The
picking of emergency was no exception to the
extraordinary manner in which the crew of ’B6 was
handled. Mr. Trimble may have been the right
man in the right place, but it is the manner of
picking and not the picked one, with which we are
now dealing. The choice lay between Messrs.
Trimble and Kennedy, but the runners of the
show could not agree as to who the man should
be, so they left the decision to Mr. William Bind, a
gentleman who had retired from active aquatics
before the present generation of rowing men had
made a start. Imbecile the N.S.W. Rowing Asso-
ciation has ever been; but it, perhaps, never before
showed its imbecility to such an extent as over
the International eight-oar race of 1885. We don’t
grudge the Victorians their victory. They de-
served it, for theirs was a crew of splendid, well-
trained men.
* * *
It now seems very likely indeed that the
long-discussed project of sending an eight-oar
amateur crew from Australia to compete at Hen-
ley regatta will soon take definite shape. Mel-
bourne is moving in the matter, and the main dif-
ficulty—which should be a surmountable one—now
appears to be re funds. In this matter it is pretty
evident the colonies will have to act separately,
as apart from the question of expediency it would
be well nigh impossible, owing to radical differ-
ences in styles of oarmanship and the impractica-
bility of getting Victorians and Cornstalks to
practise together, to send a really’good coalition
crew.

and Hatter and Javelin running a dead heat, the
owners agreed to divide. Fuse, ridden like a

fell a victory to Solo by half a length from Re-
cruit ; Goldfinder made an easy win of the April
Handicap from Pirate; Recruit, at 5 to 3 on, won
the Prince of Wales’ Stakes from start to finish;
and Goldfinder made a second win in the Ladies’
Bracelet.

The benefit tendered Jem Smith, the Eng-
lish pugilist, after his meeting with Greenfield,
proved a big boom, the Marquis of Queensberry,
Lord Clifford, and many other noblemen showing
amongst the audience. The racing world was also
largely represented.
A BtridjETiN correspondent (a new chum
spectator of the mill between Lees and Farnan)
was much Impressed by the positive gentility of
the crowd round the ropes. At any similar affair
in England the attention of the critic is somewhat
distracted from the fight inside the ring by tbe
numberless encounters outside. If Jones and
Smith are fighting for a purse “ subscribed by a
few noblemen and gentlemen,” the partisans of
Jones and Smith usually shed a good deal more
blood than their respective champions. Any ex-
pression of opinion about the probable result of
the battle is dangerous. “Jones’as got’lm beat,’
says someone who can’t restrain his feelings. “ He
ain’t, yer , take that!” says his next doornelgh-
bour. The consuming desire of 99 per cent, of the
spectators is to gouge somebody’s eye out, and
most of them strive hard to accomplish their end.
At the Lees-Farnan affair there were none of these
side shows, and even the encouragement yelled
out to either man was couched in the language of
courtesy. The new chum, accustomed to hear
such gentle exhortations as “ knock his
ini” (tbe second dash referring to internal ar-
rangements) and “kill the deadl” was posi-
tively non-plussed by the mild manners of the
Australian “ fancy.” And when he found that no-
body tried to “ clean him out ” he went away like
one bewildered. Hitherto the etiquette prevail-
ing at our “ scrapf ” has never seemed particu-
larly high-toned to us. But to the lowest depth
there is evidently a lower deep.

Lovely weather and ihe prospect of good
pacing drew together an immense concourse
at the f pening day of the A.J.C autumn meeting.
Mr. A A. Devlin made his debut before a Sydney
public, and his starting was so good that it would
appear tie A.J.C. have made no mistake in their
newly-appointed wielder of the flag. The Khivoo
opened with the Hurdle Race, which was won
cleverly by Mr. Long’s The Agent, with the
crusher of 13st. 51b., by a length and a half from
Drummer. Nelson won the Autumn Stakes from
start to finish, Malua a length away second, and
Sheet Anchor and Tempo ran a dead heat for
third place. Mr. White’s Trident and Tamarisk
finished first and second for the A J.C. Sires’ Pro-
duce Stakes, My Lord running into a place; and
the same gentleman secured similar places with
Matchlock and Monte Christo in the St. Leger,
First Prince third. Crossfire won the Doncaster
Handicap by half a length from Cairo, Siivermine
third; and Geiatlhty won the Trial Stakes, after a
great race with Sorato; Bravo third.

Canterbury course had a very narrow
squeak, for an addition to its list of killed, when
Robin Hood came to grief on Saturday last, and it
«to be hoped there is truth In the report that the
Wutorhury Club has s:me improvements In the
running course In contemplation. Rumour has it
the club Intend to buy a street adjoining the
course, which will enable a lengthening of the
running ground and a softening of the turns
that are at present so dangerous. This will ne-
cessitate a removal of the grand stand and a big
outlay of the needful, but it is only by a lengthen-
ing of the running ground that the committee
can hope to save life and limb, hnd make the ven-
ture a success in the future When Robin Hood
fell it was miraculous how the jockey-we think
Robertson was in the saddle—escaped; when the
horse jumped up, Robertson’s foot was jammed m
the stirrup-iron, and he was dragged some yards
before the horse stopped and looked round at him,
as much as to say, “ Pull your foot out, old man,’*
and the jock was not long in accepting the in-
vitation.

The O' Sullivan's peech.
E. W. O’Sullivan, who appears to hive sworn on
the Book that the name of Queanbeyan shall re-
sound from Woollahra to Geelong, and who has
pledged himself to a quarterly visit to his consti-
tuents, addressed the population of that antique
village from Phil. Pooley’s balcony on Saturday
night last. It was a weird and memorable scene.
It there bad been a moon it would have bung, a
strange and ghostly disc, far away in the East over
the dim, mysterious mountains that brood in
silence, and hold their wonderful secrets of untold
silver, and if things had been conducted properly,
a spectral mist would have risen from the silent
river and floated upward in grey columns like
phantom arms to Heaven. As it happened,
though, there were neither of these things, and
as it was pay-night on the railway works, |tho
horny-handed swarmed in on the footpaths
and defied old residents to shift them, and ex-
pressed their willingness to “ have a lash for it ”
without prejudice Just as Mr. O’Sullivan was
about to commence, the local contingent of the
Salvation Army, consisting of two uniformed
warriors, a reformed boy, one doubtful soul, a
penitent ganger, and a blood-and-flre sheep-dog,
marched up with flaring flambeaux, and took
their stand at Nugent s corner. Tnenceforward
the proceedings consisted of a lingual war between
the local member and the local captain. Bith
men looked fit and toed the mark up to time.
O’Sullivan got away to a good start, and had
almost reached the part where the labourer is
trampled under the pitiless heel of a selfish pluto-
cracy when the captain took a long wind, and an-
nounced that there was' a fountain filled with
blood, a statement received with voluble derision
by the multitude. The combat thickened. Many
prominent citizens freely backed the member to
talk the immortal hogslard out of the captain.
We clung to a lamp-post, and set our teeth hard,
and listened. We heard Mr. O Sullivan’s speech
distinctly. This is the most of it:—"l say em-
phatically that I will not”—" Shun the devil and all
his works, and flee while yet there is time from the
unspeakable horror of dternal bell “ which has
many representatives in the present Assembly,
and which, I am happy to say ’’-“storms and boils
and rages in seething and whirling billows of tem-
pestuous cerulean flames for all “ that I care
I have said already, and I say again, that I am not
the Helot of a clique, or the tool of a class,
but the earnest, and I trust, useful servant
of “ the same wily serpent that seduced the
mother of mankind, and still sways its devilish
power over”—“the squatters as a class. There
are among them hundreds, probably thousands,
who have expended years of Industry and fortunes
of capital to compass “ the eternal damnation
of millions of souls . Right here there was a
wild stampede of the public in the direction of the
army.' At first we thought they were simply “ off
to Charley Jones’s”—no outsider can conceive
how suddenly and unexpectedly thirst fastens on
a man in Queanbeyan—but we were out of it.
There was a fight, a real, physical, genuine
fight proceeding right in the centre cf the
ranks—no shadowy engagement between man
and the Devil, but the square thing be-
tween man and man. It seems someone had
“ sicked ” his unregistered cur on the army dog
and also taken the liberty of throwing lumps of
virgin earth among Booth’s boys. The captain,
forgetting his adversary on the balcony for a mo-
ment, turned to his new assailant to remonstrate.
The latter at once “stoushed” him, while the re-
formed boy smashed into the general public in an
aimless sort of way, and the doubtful soul offered
to cash anything on the surface of the globe
For 10 minutes there was nothing visible but a
surging hrieking mass of bodies writhing in
the dust, after which everyone seemed satis-
fied. The Army withdrew to their proper hall,
wailing a hymn, and the concourse went back to
hear O’Sullivan, who explained his past actions
and future Intentions amid much enthusiasm.
This is very sure—whatever Mr. O’Sullivan may
be as a statesman (which Time will decide) he is
victor.and lord of Queanbeyan, and sits as firmly
on that constituency as Leo the Thirteenth on his
throne. As a local member, he has probably no
living equal, and those who ran against him at
the last election, either as candidates or voters,
swear by him to a man. Gall for Alfred’s Pikkax I

not. injure like medicine. Always doing good,
never harm. There is no shock or sensation felt
in wearing them. There is no waiting a long time
for results ; electro-magnetism acts quickly,
generally the first week, more frequently the first
dey, and often during the first hour they are worn
their wonderful curative powers are felt.
The mind becomes active, the nervous and slug-
gish circulation are stimulated, and all the old-
time health and good feeling come back. They
1 are constructed on scientific principles, imparting
an exhilarating, health-giving current to the
whole system. Professional men assert that there
is hardly a disease which Electricity or Magnetism
may not benefit or cure, and they daily practise
the same, as your own physician will inform you.
The Corsets do not differ in appearance from
those usually worn, as we substitute our flat steel
magnetods in place of the ordinary oorset steels.
They are all equally charged, different only In
quality and design. They are elegant in shape and
finish, made after the best French patterns, and
warranted satisfactory in every respect. Those
who have tried them say they will wear no others.
Most of the above applies equally to the Electric
Belt for gents.
These goods are sent out In a handsome box. ac-
companied by a silver-plated compass, by which
the Electric-Magnetic influence can be tested. If
you cannot get them in your town, we; will qend
either kind to any port or railway station in New
South Wales or Queensland, upon receipt of price
named, with Is. 6d. added; or will mail direct to

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Alfbeds “ vivid description ” man la once more
on tne war-path. Of late there has been such a
deplorable paucity of “Revolting Murders,”
“daockicg Outrages,” “Terrible Fatalities,”
“Sickening Disclosures,” &c.,that he is evidently
“gravelled lor the lack of matter,” and has to laij
back on sub-leader writing, but even here his
ghoulish gloatlags over horrors heaped on horrors’
beads betray him. He has so long been engaged
in laying bare the minutest possibilities of a fair
from a six-storey building, or shedding the luH
glare of modern thought cn a fractured thigh’
that soma of the style that held us fascinated in
the roaring “ Woolioomooloo Tragedy ’ days wil 1
obtrude. Some of the bodies washed ashore from
the Taiaroa had been mutilated by sharks. There
is no special reason to suppose that this happened
betore they were dead—but let the sub-leader
writer speak:
“ Tnis fact, taken in coi junction with the life-
belt, suggests the possibility ot a fate for these
poor creatures betore which the imagination
shrinks with horror, and in comparison with
whica the speedy death-burial waves of the deep
sea would have been bliss indeed, u o thinx of the
helpless beings floating in tte seething waters,
the living bodies being torn limb from limb by
the ravenous monsters or the deep, sickens the
heart.”
“ The speedy death-burial waves of the deep sea
would have been Miis indeed!” To him—in
song :
Scribe of the Sbarkbitel wielder of the magic
Weird pen that thrills us with all tales of fear,
Chronicler of fratricides and doings tragic,
Herald of throats unseamed from ear to earl
Singer of massacres and mutilations,
Slinger of savage suicidal screed,
Pull well we know your grisly ministrations
kiln Sussex-street are hailed as bliss indeed.
Yours is the gift to blazon every story
Of seoret stab, and gaping ghastly gash,
Yours the one brain to weave a gory glory
Bound tramcar sacrifice or railway-smash;
Does some mad monster with a six-pound hammer
Brain all his family ? Men rush to read,
And swooning in the glamour of your grammar,
Exclaim, “ Here's something like I Here’s bliss
Indeed I”
To all occurrences that most distress men,
All deeds that make their hair stand up on end,
Your Horrid Nib, O gruesomest of pressmen,
A miracle of terror seems to lend:
Your deaths-head dictioc, your clay-cold recital
Of stifled groats from dying men who bleed
From twenty knife-thrusts, each in places vital,
“ Takes well”—in fact, is voted bliss Indeed.
What are you like ? Are you a genuine gloater
Oa crime—a worshipper of Thuggish art.
Who ail day sees a knife at every throat, or
A shadowy dagger close to every heart ?
Do you thus muse when we, unknowing, pass you,
“ His form was rigid I many a clammy bead
Stood on bis battered brow of livid ash huel”
Then sigh, “If this were true, ’twere bliss
indesd ” 7
Are you, like other men, of blood and sinew
And bone, and do you sometimes laugh and
weep ?
Does this strange craving for the ghastly In you
Make your own flesh (if you have any) creep ?
Have you a family, or e’en a missus ?
Where Is your home? We know your average
screed.
If your address li the Necropolis, is
To all the other goblins bliss indeed.
Our own obituary singer, Daley,
At times could rival your weird prose. At times
He gaily sang of subjects Abigaily
Prom his Parnassian charnel-house of rhymes;
But he could see beyond Death's mystic portal,
You lead ua to it, and no further lead—
Will you “ do ” murders in the realms immortal ?
The Press up there would count it bliss indeed.
Yet still you may not be a demigorgon.
Although your horrors almost stop our heart,
But one selected by the People s Organ
As being most proficient in the art
Of curaHug up the gore of greasy matrons
Who on their doorsteps of an eveuing read,
While round them literature’s deadhead patrons,
Tossed slipshod slatterns, think it bliss indeed.
You may be gentle, after all, and human
And have a heart that not for any gold
Would let you hurt a hair of man or woman,
Or wish a pang to mortal young or old
(That’s as a private citizen), but when you
Are building “ copy ” that will scoop the greed
You probably cry “Ruth, avaunt I” and then you
Wade in and give your readers bliss indeed.
When duty calls you, like a Press Parrhasius,
Near the triangle in the yard you stand,
And watch the quivering flesh and count the
lashes
And write down all with an unerring hand,
“He screams for mercy,” you jot down; “he's
fainting I
’Tis done I The panting criminal Is freed;”
And think as you jog home; “With my word-
painting
’Twill make the paper hum—here's bliss indeed I”
Has the great sea upon some wild shore drifted
A drowned disfigured form 7 “Ahl here’s a
prize I”
You cry: “ The fish, I see his ears have shifted,
And crabs, or something, hollowed out his eyes ?
Was he alive, I wonder when they did it ?
I’ll write that down so all who run may read 1”
Your readers shiver, and cry: “ God forbid it I ’
But think the mere suggestion bliss indeed.
Is there a murder done in some grim hovel
Where Chinamen and harlots congregate ?
You whet your soul with a “ Detective ” novel,
And on the crimes of city life dilate,
And from your brain your sombre pen will roll a
Cortege of midnight metaphors knock-kneed,
While third-edition readers cry: “ A Zola I
What photographs of vice I Here’s bliss indeed.”
Is there a colliery-explosion somewhere,
And many hapless miners sent to doom ?
You tell how quivering Ups with horror dumb
were,
And speak of “panic-stricken shocks” and
“ gloom
Soul-awoing,” and go on In such a manner,
So agonise men’s hearts and make them bleed
That the last copies sometimes fetch a “tanner,’;
While yelling newsboys think It bliss indeed.
Does a man fall from the Post Office tower ?
In wor-is that tingle to our very souls,
You tell us how “ some forty-five feet lower,
He struck successively three scaffold poles,
From which rebounding, shattered, stunned, and
bloody
He hurtled through the air with lightning-speed
Until a shapeless mass with sickening thud he
lay on the cruel flagstones I” Bliss indeed.
Will this go on for aye ? There is no knowing
But ’tis improbable that down below
Where our sad spectres are most likely going,
We II be subjected to this wail of woe.
For Dante, who was there, has never hinted
Of evening papers. But, say I— there you’d
feed
Upon such horrors as were never printed
And turn out matter that were bliss, indeed.
Consider what a monster circulation
You’d work up—how the bat-winged souls wou’d
flit
About the office to get information
Of all the fearful doings in the Pit;
Let’s see—you’d write : “ Last Tuesday was a
scorcher,
The furnace-blast was run at double speed,
Compared with it our usual days of torture
Might be described as being bliss indeed.
To-day a female friend was found garotted
Near Malebolge—her face was drawn and set;
About the nostrils blood was caked and clotted,
The tongue lolled out, and was as black as jet,
A wave of crime appears to sweep through Hades,
We warn our fair subscribers to take heed
Round Malebolge is no safe place for ladles
At night.” Oh, would not that be bliss Indeed?
Or “Hideous Tragedy: A shocking rumour
Reaches the office as we go to press,
Which has thrown quite a sable pall of gloom o’er
The public of the Pit of Hopelessness,
From what we learn it seems a new-chum spectre
But lately from the flesh-in Sydney freed
Came down disguised in Toohey Brothers’ nectar
(Which, to our readers, would be bliss indeed).
This reckless ghost, who once was much respected
In the best circles, when, at Potts’s Point
He dwelt, by Cerberus was seized, dissected
iron claws that rent him joint from joint,
Tore cut his entrails, crushed his bones to powder,
Reduced him to a gory pulp with speed,
Then gorged himself, the meanwhile bellowing
louder
Than fifty Waterloos,” 'twere bliss indeed.
Or this: “ A demon who has been suspected
For some time past has, owing to the skill
Of our reporter, been at length detected
Endeavouring to work a private still;”
Or this, “ A forty-headed hydra, lately
(From which the management propose to breed)
Has been acclimatised. ’Tis said ’twill greatly
Accelerate our torments.” Bliss indeed I
Bat, no! They could not be accelerated
Where you had been for any length of time;
So we can only pray, when you’re translated
It will he high unto a fairer clime.
Whatever depth of utter gloom awaits us
We will not gnash our teeth, if ’tis decreed
That there your “copy”—how the thought elates
us I
May never enter. That were bliss indeed.
HOW HE MUST SUFFER.
“Good marnin’, Mrs. O’Toole! An’ so
they tell me yer husband is sick, an’ what
sames ter be the mather wid the poor
man?”
“Ah! Mrs. Murphy, he has had a ter-
rible attack of spine in his back; he’s
flit it a cornin’ on this long while.”

four times the price. For Costumes and

Carnrick’s Cod Liver Oil &Milk
PEPTONISED (DIGESTED.)
Highly recommended by the Medical Profession throughout the world as being
the best remedy for Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Scrofula, Wasting
Diseases, Consumption, General Debility, over-taxed brains, &c., &e.
It will produce an immediate gain in flesh and strength;
Can be taken when all other forms of Cod Liver Oil are refused.
It contains about equal parts of the best Norwegian Cod Liver Oil and concen-
trated fresh milk, both peptonised (dig ested).
The peptonised milk disguises the unpleasa nt taste and smell of the oil, and
r i m , a , ke / it! a f sweet as cream; very p alatable and most nourishing.
Invaluable for children, and will agree with the most delicate persons, causing
no return or unpleasantness.
One trial will satisfy anyone of the great value of this new and unique pre-
paration.
The reconstructive or nutritive properties are five times greater than the
_ it. .? or any Other Emulsion? kience it is much cheaper.
Both the Oil and the Milk being digested, the whole will assimilate, whereas
in Cod Liver Oil and other Emulsions (being undigested) only a small
proportion is of any value. It is the most nerfect Emulsion ever
made, and the only one of digested Cod Liver Oil and Milk.
Analysed and recommended by the first Professors in Europe.
We also manufacture the above preparation combined with Hypophospbites
of Lime and Soda. SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS. •
THE MALTiNE MANUFACTURING CO., LIM., LONDON.
Carnnck s Soluble It*oodfor^&ntg, invalids,
Aged Persons, is the most nutritious, palatable, and easily-digested Infant’s
Pood over manufactured, containing fifty per cent, of the solids of milk (digested),
and fifty per cent, of the finest wheat, converted into soluble form.
A most perfect food. The nearest approach to Mother’s Milk ever made.
It is unequalled for the formation of fat, flesh, and bone, and increasing
the vital forces so necessary to health.
Specially recommended in cases of Marasmus, Diarrhoea, and Cholera
Infantum, and where the digestion is defective.
Children fed .upon cereals or cow’s milk alone very often remain weak, and
suffer from softening of the bones, and when attacked by infantile dis-
orders are unable to resist the inroads of disease.
‘CAKNRICK'S SOLUBLE FOOD’’ is invaluable for Invalids
and Aged Persons (who cannot digest farinaceous food), as it is rich
m nutritive and easily-digested albumenoids, thus increasing both flesh
and strength, and restoring the vital forces.
It is most convenient for use,being in a powdered form, and will keep indefinitely.
When boiled and stirred for three minutes it is ready for immediate use.

HOWLANDS’ ODONTO is the best, purest
and most fragrant preparation for the teeth.
Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness ol the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes
nor pastes can possibly be as efficacious for polish-
ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non-gritty tooth powder; such
Rowlands’ Odonto has always proved itself to be.
HOWLANDS EUKONIA is a beautifully
pure, delicate, and fragrant toilet rowder, and
has lately been much improved. Each box has
inside the lid a certificate of purity from D».
Redwood, Ph D„ F.C.S., &c. Sold in three tints :
white, rose, and cream.
HOWLANDS’ MAKASSAR OIL can uow
be also had in a golden colour, which is especially
sultea for fair or golden-haired children and per-
sons. Four sizes.
Ask any dealer in perfumery for Rowlands’
articles, of 20 Hatton Garden, London, and avoid

By not heeding the warnings of Nature, many persons

Peter Campbell, who states that he has
joined the Freethought people, got blind drunk in
Melbourne, the other day, to celebrate the event,
and was locked up. This is a email matter for
Peter, as, it being his “ first offence,” he was dis-
charged with a caution, and his property (amongst
which were three watches I) returned to him. But
what must harrow up the delicate feelings of the
holy old boy is a statement by Jos. Symes that the
Freethinkers don’t want himl Says Jos-—“He
has. no doubt, the same right to call himself a
Freethinker as I have to call myself a Christian.
But the Freethinkers no more recognise Peter
Campbell as one of themselves than the Presby-
terians do me as one of their godly ministers.”
We thing of going in for some short bio-
graphies. or rather biographical notices if eminent
men. We started at Samson, some time ago, but
after this the writer gave us an article on Mrs.
Potiphar, which being decidedly libellous, we de-
clined to print. This broke him up. and he left us
to join the Protestant Standard, which we ex
pect to see very shortly give Mrs. P. the “doing”
we declined to fulminate. We are not quite
decided yet upon the style we shall adopt for our
sketches, but we think that their colouring will be
something in this wise:—

This gentleman—one of the most eminent of our
citizens was born at the picturesque town of

elder Tart was named Djam Tart, and was by
trade a brass founder. He was like wise the founder
of (juong. .At a comparatively early age Quong
looked about and beheld his countrymen emigrat-
ing to this country, where they became hewers of
™od; and bumpers of cabbages. Than he laughed
bhi ual (in Chinese) and resolved to improve upon
this altogether. So he went to the Mandarin of
the district, where the Gobung rolls its turbid
flood, and got a letter to a notability here just
seven yards long. Then he girded up his gunny
bag, and “shoved.” On his arrival in Bydmy. the
enterprising Mr. Q. T. immediately presented hid
letter to the magnate to whom it was addressed.

A LITTLE TRUTH ABOUT A. G.
TAYLOR IN LONDON.
LONDON GOSSIP FROM “THE BULLETIN'S”
AGENT-GENERAL.
London, 13 th March.
Dsar Bulletin,—l have a theme that
would admit of sensational handling'. But it does
not require it. I Imagine that on this, as on all
Subjects, you will care only for the unadorned
truth (the gods only know how sparingly it is
dealt out by the N.S.W. Press 1) and so the truth
you shall have; only the truth, and nothing but
the truth. The whole truth I cannot promise you
—hence the gratifying adjective in the title of this
article. Such things as I, to my Intense regret,
am obliged to reserve were whispered to me in
confidence by " Mudgee Taylor ” himself. They
concern others besides himself, and—well, you
know the man, with his simple loyalty which
smells of the eucalyptus and the wattle-gum-he
sealed my lips and pen. And until he can be per-
suaded to remove that seal sundry colonial or
Anglo-Colonial “ rotters ” may breathe freely.
As It is, I shall, doubtless, get into trouble
for unfolding this tale. But lam used to that
now, and am prepared to risk it once more. In
this case I judge silence to be copper instead of
pure metal, so here goes to break it I
♦ ♦ t
I need not dwell upon the celebrated case,
Taylor y. the Speaker of the N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly. Everyone knows of the big victory
the “long” young cornstalk has won: and his in-
domitable pluck in coming 10,000 miles to fight his
oauae (the cause of liberty and common-sense) is,
while lam writing—and now that he has heen sue-
tmfvl—the talk and admiration of N.S.W. Bless
you I it is also the talk and admiration of the
Anglo-Australians here. Why, when I saw him to-
day Taylor had actually been lunching with Mr.
JAtt, that truly great man, who, whether as agent
either for a professional oarsman, a Parliamentary
candidate, a philanthropic society, or a colonial
evening newspaper, is ever and always pre-
eminent and irresistible. I may state that the
young member for Mudgee did not lunch with Mr.
Charles Lett before the happy, and to many people
and papers (including the mighty organ for which
Mr. 0. L., as I hinted some time ago, manipulates
oabjee), unexpected conclusion of his case.

Among your travelled readers, many—
possibly the ms jority—have, at some time or the
other,- "aone steerage,” or, what is the same
thing, third-class. Those who have not must not
consider themselves among the “ much-travelled.’'
Now, the man travelling in the saloon who ought
to be In the steerage is in an uncomfortable posi-
tion, unless he has a moral hide like—but no I I
venture to assert, however, that the man, travel-
ling steerage, who ought to be in the saloon, is in
• far more pitiable condition. lie is under as
serious social disadvantages as the other— without
the substantial consolation of good “ tucker,” and
so forth. But how much are those disagreeables
aggravated when the unfortunate traveller has
women-folk with him ? Taylor, as you probably
know, came home in the third-class with his wife,
a gentle, retiring bush-flower, to whom roughing
It on the sea was terribly new, and his mother, an
old lady of past 70. Fate, with pleasant irony, sent
hone in the saloon of the same ship, among many
other fortunate colonists, Mr. T. C. Binny, for the
benefit of hia health-I mean to represent the
N.S.W. Mining Department at the Indian and
Colonial Exhibition. I want to know—and my
curiosity is shared by many others-how It came
about that the political party to which Taylor be-
longed permitted him to leave Sydney in the steer-
age of a mail-boat with a few paltry pounds in his
pocket. Probably A.G.T. and his friends will tell
me to mind my own business.
• • a
Well, everybody on board the steamer of
course soon knew who the lanky cornstalk in the
third class was. The passengers forward eyed
him askance, as by a supreme effort of deglutition,
he burled the morning “ burgoo ” and th-3 midday
M cag-mag,” or as he worried round the limited
deck in search of a quiet and comfortable corner
for his gentler companions. “If that wasn’t good
enough for him, why didn’t he crimson well travel
saloon with his women? They (the virtuous
steerage passengers) wouldn’t have any truck with
them sort o’ people.” But with the saloon passen
gers who knew Taylor, either personally or by
repute, who understood his errand, admired his
Pluo*. and respected his abilities, it was, of course,
very different. They visited him daily, and alto-
gether, what with sundry bottles of wine, dessert,
cigars, books, cheerful conversation, and genuine
sympathy, these kind saloon passengers from Aus-
tralia brightened the weary way considerably for
their three friends for’ard. Have I not insisted
before what a hearty generous fellow the average
Australian abroad is ? Let us, as Gladstone would
say, proceed dispassionately to inquire and inves-
tigate. Mr. A. G. Taylor had but one civility of
aay kind extended to him by his fellow-country-
men from the saloon of the mailboat. Mr. T, C.
Binny, with a thoughful courtesy that is beyond
praise, one day sent him a book to read, a book
on mining subjects—one of those laborious com-
pilations of Harrie Wood’s, which would, doubt-
less, be found instructive, if one had but sufficient
eoncentrativenoss to apply to their study. When
any little luxury chanc.d to find its way from
“aft” into Mrs. Taylor’s lap, a coin simultane-
ously found its way from Mr. Taylor’s shallow
poekst into the itchiag palm of steward, baker,
or cook. Well, after all, it takes a great deal of
hgrd, rough fare to kill man or woman, and one
may even live through six weeks of third-class
sleeping accommodation with its close, sweaty at-
mosphere. Taylor, with his wife and mother,
arrived ip England, and placing himself under the
guidance of the third-class steward, found humble
board and shelter at the house of that gentleman’s
mother at Btratford-by-Bow, upon very modest
terms. Sixty Chobham-road, Stratford, E., ij a
wretched tenement in a wretched bye-street in
one of the most wretched localities in East Lon-
don. Stratford is not only in the East, but in the
far East— beyond Whitechapel, Stepney, and Bow.
When I say that it Is “down near the docks,” 1
express volumes, even to the uninitiated, Jma
gine, you dwellers In Macquarie-street mansions,
Randwiok villas, Petersham cottages, and bush
bungalows (even if they be of bark and contain
but one room) under the most genial of suns, and
the bluest of burnished skies, you to whom the
word “basement" sounds like Chinese—imagine
spending a winter—the most cruel England has
seen for many years—in one of the poorest quar-
ters of the greatest city in the world, your bed-
room on the ground floor, and your “living” room
underground, otherwise, in the “basement.” Are
your imaginations elastic? Can you feel the bitter
cold? Can you see the dirty trodden snow on the
narrow roadway without? Can you hear the land-
lady swearing because the taps are frozen, and she
can get no water? Can you see the group of “un-
employed” at the corner yonder trying to stamp
the chill out of their limbs? You must compre-
hend all that, and more, if you wish to catch a
glimmering conception of Taylor’s winter in Lon-
don. You must feel the sickening anxiety of a
coming issue that may make or break your life.
You must assume raiment grotesquely poor; and
you must diet yourself—meat, once weekly, on
Sundays for dinner; week day dinner, cheap fish,
ox liver, or tripe; breakfast, bread and tea; sup-
per, ditto ditto. You must also feel that even
these poor conditions, which are shared by your
wife and mother, may at any moment change for
the worse through the failure of funds.

I was present at the first hearing of Tay-
lor’s case. That long lean figure clad in the rough
well-worn clothes was a strange one to appear as
the hero of such a cause before such a court. He
was supported by one colonist—not a slimy, empty-
headed, full-stomached, “ returned Australian
but a plain journalist, the sort of man that
wouldn’t have his name mentioned for the wealth
of Wilson. In fact, it is among pressmen alone
that Taylor has found friends in London. You will
not be surprised to hear that he was terribly ner-
vous on that critical occasion; so much so, that
we were apprehensive that he would be unable to
speak. The want of square living was painfully
apparent. When the time came for him to speak,
however, ho surprised some of us. If his stomach
was empty, his head at least was full, and warming
to his work, he proceeded logically and eloquently
to plead his cause.
♦ * *
When I first met Taylor here a comparison
between the genuine stuff and the rubbish in the
way of representative Australianism Immediately
forced Itself upon me. Dieu merci, I have seen
“ Representative Australians ” here—men who
live fatly, clothe richly, dine in West End man-
sions. haunt aristocratic clubs, and spend their
colonial gains in the desperate effort to climb over
the kitchen-wall into English society—men who
made fortunes out your way by jewing and
grasping, aided by the winkings of corrupt and
imbecile Governments; or penniless adventurers,
who snavelled unto themselves wealthy Australian
wives. But here was a representative Australian
of an entirely new order—a typical cornstalk-
bred and educated in the colony which gave him
birth, and at the age of 37—although without
influence and money—a prominent member of
that colony’s Legislature. A bush genius, whose
only weaknesses are his honesty which is too
sterling, and his feelings which are too sensitive,
stood before me in shabby bushman’s attire, with
the look of a bushman in his face and a bushman’s
pipe In his mouth, although unfortunately not
with a bushman’s feed behind his waistcoat. It
was not worth the while of representative Austra-
lians to take him up. For one thing they never
imagined for a moment that he would be success,
ful. Taylor is the last man in the world to accept
charity, and representative Australians are not
accustomed to offer even “ temporary accommoda-
tion ” unless they see a chance of cent, per cent,
in some form or the other. A chance indeed is
not sufficient—they require a certainty. As an in-
stance, in the present case— but there, I daren’t,
although the temptation is terrible. Apart from
one or two journalists, the only man who has held
out any sort of a hand to Taylor is Sir Saul
Samuel, who always does the proper thing judi-
ciously.
* * *
Taylor is still hard-up, and still at Chobham
road, but now that his big success has come I sup-
pose he won’t be so, for long. He is anxious to get
away from these parts, which he calls the “ Arctic
Regions,” as soon as possible, and no doubt the
“ rent ” will be forthcoming from some quarter or
other before this reaches you. The quixotism of
the man was well illustrated when he refused to
pursue his advantage and sue for damages before
a jury, because what damages he might gain would
come out of the Public Treasury. When you get him
keep him, for you have not too many of that sort
Probably, notwithstanding the hard lines he fell
upon, his visit to London will inflaitely benefit
him in many ways, and through him N.S W. For
my part I am convinced of thls-that A. G. Taylor,
if he lives and perseveres, will exercise no small
good Influence on the destiny of his country. If,
working with a few men of a new school, he helps
to sweep abuse, corruption, effete humbug, and
hoary incapacity from your governmental system,
he will have done more for the colony than any
man of his time.
* * *
I have told this tale at the risk of rulliing
Taylor’s sensibilities, because I think his country-
men should hear it. Perhaps some day when he
can afford to look back upon his troubles with
cheerfulness, he will fill the blanks himself. “ To e
Cornstalk in London, an Autobiographical Sketch
by A. G. Taylor,” may be a cherished classic
among the New South Welsh youth of the next
generation.

X am sure you will be very sorry to hear of
the very painful accident which happened to Mr-
Gladstone the other evening. The Right Honour-
able gentleman unfortunately chanced to enter
the House at a moment when an hon. member wes
giv ng notice of a motion with reference to post-
cards for Australasia. The Premier stumbled
against an " h ” that was lying upon the floor, and
falling, his right eye received a severe bruise from
a “g” that was standing upon end. The subse-
quent motion by an indignant Radical, to the
effect that hon. members whose alphabet was In-
complete should bo provided with empty noeo-
bags while in the chamber, was carried by a large
majority.
& ♦ s|t
No doubt it was cabled to you that Con-
servative members were complaining of a bitter
draught which nightly fanned the Opposition
benches of the House of Commons. The cause has
since been discovered to have been the flapping
of an hon. member’s ears. The member for a cer-
tain notoriously corrupt and long-disfranchised
constituency is now accommodated with a seat in
the Speaker’s gallery.

Mrs. Conover rageth at the desertion of
Mr. Philip Beck, who kept his departure for Aus-

have an opportunity of seeing Mr. Beck in Pyg-

A number of funny people have become
Interested in Taylor since he won his case. Among
others, “Handsome Charlie” (Lett) claimed him
as an old acquaintance. “ Why, Taylor, old man.”
he said, slapping the young ’un familiarly on the
left shoulder-blade, “you ought to remember
me. I had the honour of filing a criminal Infor-
mation against you when you were in the artil-
lery, for pledging your uniform, don’t you kno w ?
Old John Williams didn’t wish to prosecute, but
the Attorney-General insisted upon it. Eh I you
remember ? ” The cream of the joke, of course
is that the yarn is as old as it is false. It was pro-
pagated by a certain local rival of Taylor’s, and
Charlie, I suppose, confidingly took it from a
newspaper as gospel. Taylor said nothing, only
grinned inwardly, and Charlie went away under
the impression that a lively flight of imagination
had passed for an excellent effort of memory.

We don’t go to music-halls or theatres,
now, and Rcmano’s, the Monico, and the Cafe
Royal know us no more. Too slow for up, all of
’em. We’re on another lay now, and find It
cheaper and nicer. We go to revival meetings,
Salvationist gatherings, and “sich like,” and have
larks. We were grieved and alarmed the other
day to And that a paper called the Christian
Miliion is making an effort to deprive us of our
gentle pastime. Thus a correspondent to the
prudish rag:-
“ Side by side with the astonishing development
of prurient literature, there has grown uo In Sun- I
day-schools and temperance societies with a close I
membership an equally astonishing development
of kissing games. The old-fashioned outdoor kiss-
iSli* p ld i? °f school-treats, and the equally harm-
less forfeits played (and paid) beneath ttie mistletoe
u^ e u fi: i ver V place t 0 a Bet of kissing games, in
which teachers and senior scholars indulge for
hours together, and which form the great attrac-
tion of many gatherings. . . It was our painful
duty to visit a London Sabbath-school entertain-
ment where these things were being carried on
from six in the evening till midnight. We
protested verbally, and also by leaving an en-
tertalnment where we felt the presence of Goi
was not being recognised. It began with a
cancan, in which, t© an idiotic song and tune, first
the upper and then the lower members of the body
wore raised and swung about. After this an hour
was spent in ‘kissing and hissing.” Then came
the great treat called ‘the Army.’ Marching
round in pairs these Sunday school teachers went
through a drill in which ‘ present arms ’ and ‘ lire
a volley meant embracing and kissing between
the sexes. When we state that the male ‘ teachers’
knelt down before their partners to embrace
them, and that six ‘ volleys ’ were ordered at once
or that kissing in that posture was ordered to con-
tinue until the word ‘ halt ’ from the fugleman
the reason of our departure and strong indignant
protest wll be evident.”
Yesterday’s Daily Telegraph contained a
leader on “ kissing-games” and no end of corres-
pondence.

The Jewish Messenger says“ The dis-
Inollniaon of young: men to join the Jew-
ish ministry is due to the simple fact that
this Is a commercial age, and that it does
not Pay, in the common meaning of the
word, to become a minister.” We can’t under-
stand this. We never saw a hard-up Rabbi, nor a
Christian minister who hadn’t a good skinful of
food, and a tolerable suit of clothes. What more
do the holy brethren want? Doesn’t pay—we
aon t care to pursue the subject. We only suggest
to the white-chokered gentlemen that Sheol, Para-
dise, and God have still some meaning to the un-
godly, and that whether the parroting of the old
eeers pays ” or not, is a matter of no conse-
quence to the living men of to-day. It s not un-
behef in a God that keeps people away from
religious ceremonies now a days. That clear per-
ception which modern education has brought lets
people see that the so-called God-ordained teachers
want to make the thing “pay”—and the natural
result follows. The cleric too often drifts away
down in popular estimation to the grade of a
Chinese joss house man.
William Lloyd Garrison, the slavery-aboli-
tioulst, remarks Goldwin Smith in Macmillan,
while he proclaimed the equality of black and
white, was careful, when about to be married, to
assure a tattling world that his affianced bride was
not a black woman. Why should he not have mar-
ried a black woman ? There can be no real
equality, social or political, without intermar-
riage; and without real equality there can be no
republic. But of intermarriage between the
white and black races in the South there is no
hope; it is barred, not < nly by social tradition,
which time would obliterate, but by physical an-
tipathy. The line has been drawn more sharply
and indelibly than ever, since the negro woman
has ceased to be at the command of white over-
seers and drivers. For the present the negro,
inured to subjection, and with the brand of
slavery fresh upon him. submits alike to social
parlahshlp and Political suppression. His fran-
chise remains almost a nullity. But this can hardly
last for ever. When it comes to an end, what will
follow ? The negroes multiply faster than the
whites ; their physical constitution is better
adapted to the climate; they seem to cling to their
homes. If they have faculties capable of being
developed they will, when educated, become im-
patient of subordination; but this will scarcely
secure peace and union between the races. The
situation is one without precedent in history, and
forms one of the darkest problems of the future.
BRAIN WORRY.
After all, heroism is not the effete principle
which pessimists would have us believe. The
silent toilers of the world, exhibit, to the full, as
much courage, endurance, and heroic gratitude,
as any great conqueror by field or Hood. If the
conscientious strivings with a hard and unoom-
prom sing world seem uncommonplace beside the
achievements of warrior or statesmen, they are
only lesser in degree. The motive force of the
heroic is duty, and It is questionable whether the
more dramatic action of this principle reflects
greater credit upon a man, than the silent, patient,
and enduring energy with which the more obscure
citizen does. Oh, how full of briars is this work-
ing day world,” says Shakespere, and surely he
who works under conditions perhaps, of dire
disease, encounters hardships as keen and terrible
as any of wreck or campaign. la these times all
men who have to work must do it with all their
might. If the hours of labour be shorter than in
pastimes, the stress is harder, and the competition
more severe. The easy steady work of old times is
succeeded by the rush and strain of modern ne-
cessities. And of all species of labor, none so
thoroughly “burns out” the candle of health as
brain work. Ordinarily it involves, too, a higher
and more conscientious sense of duty. Brain work-
ers don't strike-they work ou until they fail, and
are pressed under foot by the ever-increasing army
of Intellectual competition. In the bloom of
health, and the full force of nervous energy’ the
brain-worker laughs to scorn any limitation to his
capacity. The more work he does, the better he
lines it. Meanwhile, he is literally burning him-
self out. The phosphatss and phosphoric acid
which are eliminated from the system of the in-
tellectual laborer are immensely in excess of the
waste suffered by theartisan orlabover. “Aburn-
ing thought” Is an expression of literal significance.
Every thought, emotion, or mental excitement
wastes so much brain matter; and if the phosphorus
loss is not returned by food, or food agents, ex-
haustion ensues, and disease sets in. We can
imagine no more significant evidence of this than
Is given by Mr J. (flouting, head Master of Water-
loo /state School, near /Sydney. Be says that he
has suffere d from kidney troubles for ten years.
During the early part of that time he tried several
medical men of the highest reputation in New
South Wales, but with no permanent benefit. He
was told by one of the most eminent, whom ho
shall always remember for his unselfish advice,
that no medicine then known could cure him, and
that drugs would only increase the evil. Thus
advised, Mr. Clouting abstained from the use of
medicines, and wore a hydropathic bandage, and
paid strict attention to diet, eating very little ani-
mal food, so as to lighten the labour of the kidneys
The disease, howevtr, gradually increase!, as evi-
denced by the fixed dull pain in the loins, a burden
almost unendurable, until his attention was direct-
ed to Warner's safe cure. He hazarded the trial of
a bottle, the efieets of which were so satisfactory
that he had taken nearly eight bottles. He now
lound himself free from the old too familier pain,
and every symtom Indicating a spee’y recovery.
This is the testimony of a gentlemen who suffered,
not merely from disease, but from the weariness
of mental labour and anxieties while in agony.
Unquestionably, the strain and stress of teaching’
contribute very largely to disorganisation of the
physical and irnntai systems. The leading organs
o f st cret ion and excretion suffer under sympathetic
action with the excited and irritated nervous sys-
tem It is here that this grand remedy asserts it-
self as a recuperator of the disarranged machinery
and a gentle force under the operation by which it
is set into harmonious movement.
