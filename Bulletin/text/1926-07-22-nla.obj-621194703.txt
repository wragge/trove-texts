THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections may be traced to the
human mouth as a starting point. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes
Are the most powerful, safe and pleasant Germi-
cide and Antiseptic known. Beine- destructive to
all organisms which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.
The Lancet (London) states:—“Their purpose is to
act as a bactericide in the mouth. This result is
likely to be gained, for in the experiments tried
Eumenthol .Jujubes proved to be as effective bac-
tericidally as is creosote.”

Romance and Reality
The Red Page
An Elizabethan poet maintained the un-
romantie doctrine that the purpose of play-
ing was to hold the mirror up to nature.
This statement appeared so startlingly hereti-
cal, so opposed to all correct principles of
art, that a notable representative of the
’nineties, to wit, Oscar Wilde, professed to
think it was introduced by the dramatist to
prove Hamlet’s madness. Judging by their
writings, more critics agree with Wilde than
with Shakspeare. Art is art, it seems, be-
cause it is not nature, and the more unlike
nature it is the more it is to be appreciated.
The current opinion of this school seems
to be that life as we live it is so dull, so
intolerably tedious, that the sole excuse
for art is that it provides an escape from
reality. One of the most brilliant of modern
American writers, James Branch Cabell, up-
holds this point of view with erudition and
the most engaging humor. He demands from
literature, with which he is primarily con-
cerned, all that he is .unable to find in actual
life. Life to this ingenious sage is chaotic,
irrational, full of blunders and ineptitudes.
Therefore he seeks in literature what life
is unable to supply, a logical sequence of
events, clarity, beauty, harmony. The splen-
dors of Marlowe, the eccentricities of
Dickens, these things, he explains, are not
in life but in literature, though Dickens
labored under the delusion that he was a
realistic writer. But Cabell is more philoso-
phical than the majority of romantics, who
are usually so dull and unimaginative that
they are ready to welcome any possible
escape from their uninteresting selves. Hence
the popularity of the “pictures” and cheap
novels of adventure. Unexciting people like
office clerks and professors, who have never
taken a chance in their lives, like to see
themselves in fancy costumes, stuek with
guns or rapiers, hitting the high spots and
performing vicarious heroic deeds. This is
a harmless enough vanity, but when it is
taken as the first principle of aesthetics the
issue becomes confused. And no one can
confuse an issue like a non-performing pro-
fessor of literature!
Bnt, despite romantic protests, the pro-
gress of art and literature appears to be
towards a deeper apprehension of reality.
In depictive art the great Italian masters
selected only noble persons and gorgeous set-
tings for the subjects of their pictures. They
saw life always in a golden glow. Beautiful
as their works are, the beauty resides not in
their subjects bnt in their painting. It was
left to Rembrandt and the Dutchmen to
extend the boundaries of art. Nothing human
was alien to Rembrandt, who made master-
pieces out of the humblest material —a young
man musing over a wall, an Amsterdam mer-
chant, decrepit woman, children play-
ing in back streets, even the interior of a
butcher’s shop. To the end of his days
Ruskin never forgave Rembrandt for his
vulgar realism. In landscape-painting the
progress from a conventional towards a freer
treatment of nature was still more marked.
Earlier painters like Claude required castles,
classic temples and picturesque settings. Con-
stable was satisfied with ordinary English
scenes, though he sometimes liked to intro-
duce a group of trees or a windmill to
balance his composition, but anything in
nature was good enough for Old Crome.
Even Corot, in his earlier works, felt com-
pelled to set a few nymphs dancing through
his filmy trees, but later on found they were
unnecessary. In modern art all nature is
accepted as suitable subject matter, nothing
whatever being barred.
In literature it is the same story, the
mirror of art being gradually held up to
more and more aspects of nature. It looks
strange to us that Shakspeare, like most of
the Elizabethans, should have regarded him-
self as a realist, an interpreter of life, when
a more self-conscious modernist like Tolstoi
takes him to task for the arbitrary nature
of his inventions. To Tolstoi the greatest
of all literary sins was what he called “in-
According to Gorki he wanted
truth to life, not invention, and he picked
out in Gorki’s stories the parts that came
direct from life, separating them from the
parts that he could see clearly had been
merely invented. “That’s not true,” he would
say, “you invented that”; or “I like that char-
acter; you didn’t invent him.” The popular
novel is all invention, and invention of the
feeblest order. It is quite divorced from
humanity, and impossible people react in
the most extraordinary way from situations
that have been obviously faked to meet the
exigencies of a quite unnecessary and foolish
plot. Anything suggestive of reality is
avoided like the plague.
It is difficult to understand the pessimistic
dictum that art is dope, life being so drab
and insignificant that man goes to art, not
as a representation or revelation of life, but
as an antidote against it. If Middleton
Murry is right. Keats, who is usually re-
garded as the chief of the romantics, is the
most misunderstood poet in the English lan-
guage. His own conception of poetry is just
flic opposite from what orthodox critics sup-
posed it to be. Far from being aesthetical in
the narrowest sense of that word, it sought
to embrace man’s. whole ■ experience of life.
“The Eve of St. Agnes,” for example, may
be a masterpiece, bnt it is not the kind of
n aster piece l by which Keats wished to be
•emembered. H.c. himself preferred his
'Lamia,” for the reason that he thought it
contained a deeper experience of life, which
"as his own test of poetry.
But whatever the development of litera-
ture in tin- past may have .been, there is
little doubt that the modern writer is a
‘hunter of life,” as liodin puts it. whose
lint is a clearer and more resolute apprehen-
sion of tin* nature of man and the world.
We are no longer overawed by kings and
zeroes, for we know now they were no djf-
’erent from anybody else. History has found
Item out. We are more interested nowadays
n tli« inner life of man, the complexity of
lis thought and emotions, his conscious arid
uibconscious reactions, his dreams, scruples
and aspirations, than in mere decorative
trappings, fancy costumes and external
adventures.
James Joyce has created a great modern
masterpiece out of the events of one day.
Nothing startling occurs, the scenes and
characters are those with which we are all
familiar, there are no ingenious inventions,
no romantic interludes, and still we are held
spellbound by this uncanny yet veracious
picture of multitudinous and abounding life.
The famous Walpurgis-night of Goethe is no
more terrifying than the Dublin night scene
in “Ulysses.” Leopold Bloom is a more
authentic character than Falstaff, and the
young student, Stephen, is as vivid a figure
as Hamlet and more comprehensible. After
such a massive work, the unreal dreams of
the romanticists seem absurdly trivial. If
life, the commonest life, is so absorbing, so
full of riches, why always this feverish desire
of escape into a little world of dreams so
infinitely less beautiful and significant thaa
the despised reality left behind? After all,
there is no true romance that is not rooted
in the earth and the nature of man.
LO UIS ESSON.
Herman Melville
In liis introduction to “The Cruise of the
Cachalot,” Frank T. Bullen said he believed
his book to be the first detailed account of
a whaling cruise written from the ordinary
sailor’s standpoint. That was in 1.897. He
had not then heard of Herman Melville and
“Moby Dick,” written in 1851. When he
did subsequently read '“Moby Dick” he said
that had he read it previously he never would
have been able to write “The Cruise of the,
Cachalot.” In his Herman Melville, which
John Freeman has just written for the
“English Men of Letters” series, he says:
“To admit that Melville did not* always write
greatly is easy; but he was, nevertheless,
among the greatest of modern imaginative
writers. Morley Roberts speaks of “Moby
Dick” as Melville’s “magnificent achieve-
ment,” and wonders why it is the Americans
still look forward to some great American
book when all they have to do is to cast
their eyes backwards and find it.
When Melville was a young man he taught
in a school. He left that and, inspired
thereto, it is believed, by reading Dana’s
“Two Years Before the Mast,” signed on
as an ordinary seaman on a whaling-ship,
and did not return to his home-town until
he had spent four adventurous years in
various parts of the world. He thereafter
wrote a number of books and magazine
articles that made his name to a certain
extent known in England and America, but,
not becoming a literary success, he re-
turned to school-teaching; then he settled
down as a clerk in the Customs, wrote more
books and died practically unknown at an
advanced age. He was a thinker, a mystic,
an incurable idealist, and his four adventu-
rous years showed him to be a man of fine
physical strength and courage. During those
four years he lived at one period for four
months with cannibals on a Pacific island,
served on a number of whaling-ships whose
crews seemed to have been more crude and
primitive than the cannibals, and then under-
went the cruel discipline of life on an Ameri-
can man-of-war. D. H. Lawrence, in
“Studies of Classic American Literature,”
comments : “Poor Melville! He was deter-
mined that Paradise existed. So he was
always in Purgatory. He was born for Pur-
gatory. Some souls are purgatorial by des-
tiny.” All he knew of Melville Lawrence
got out of “Moby Dick,” and there is no-
thing more to know. He is Captain Ahab —
the man who is quite insane as to his life
object, but as perfectly sane in the means he
employs to achieve that object. He sails
ostensibly to carry out his employers’ orders,
but in reality to find and destroy the great
White Whale, the first cause of all the suffer-
ing that has driven him insane. “All that
most maddens and torments; all that stirs
up the lees of things; all truth with malice
in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes
the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life
and thought; all evil—to crazy Ahab,
they were all visibly personified and
made practically assailable in “Moby
Dick.” Captain Ahab, “who, gifted
with high perception, lacks the low
enjoying power, and is damned, most
subtly and malignantly damned in the midst
of Paradise,” is only an allegorical Melville.
All enthusiastic idealists are a little insane,
and Melville, an enthusiastic idealist if ever
there was one, was no exception. He, just
as madly as Ahab, set out to find and destroy
all those evil things that were symbolised
for Ahab in the great White Whale. And
he was as sane as Ahab was in working out
the means to the attainment of his end. He
was also Starbuck, the first mate, “whose
office it was to obey, rebelling, and to hate
with a touch of pity.” There is also much
of Stubb the fatalistic second mate in him—•
Stubb, “who, knowing not what may be
coming, whatever it will be will go to it
laughing.”
The Pequod, a fantastic ship with a fan-
tastic crew, sails down a fantastic world.
But there is ever about this fantastic ship
and the doings of her fantastic crew some-
thing suggestive of unconquerable, unquench-
able beauty and strength. The world is that
one ever more or less seen by the tempera-
mentally super-refined, the intellectually
profound, the Hamlets of life. For these
Hamlets there is the real with all its shal-
lowness and ugliness so apparent to the
physical sight, and there is the baffling, mys-
tical, invisible beyond that their penetrating
mental sight makes them ever vaguely aware
of. Such a Hamlet—a man with a god’s
vision doomed to live with man-sighted men
must assuredly have been the author of
“Moby Dick.”
Yet “Moby Dick” is not a book only for
the Hamlets of life. Melville, like the whale
ho writes of, was two-sighted. He saw an
ordinary whaliug-sliip and her crew just as
another man would see it, and described il
in clearest detail. Iljs hook has been
acknowledged as the finest book on the whale
and the old-time whaling industry ever writ-
ten. He also described that ship and her

crew as a god would see it. He magnified,
exaggerated. He turned the ship and the
members of the crew into universal, all-time
types. And what does any great tragic
artist ever do but this? He takes the little
and commonplace, and shows how grand and
extraordinary it is. He suggests what it
signifies. He shows it not as a small com-
plete thing, but as part of an immeasurably
vast whole—a whole that reaches beyond life
and death, and what we call the Beginning
and End.
One comes every now and then on descrip-
tive passages that recall Joseph Conrad. In
the almost oppressive, portentous fatefulness
that more or less envelops all the characters
and points ever the culminating tragedy,
there is much that is reminiscent of Conrad,
too. Then there are passages that in their
terrific imaginativeness—passages such as
that last one when the setting sun silhouettes
the giant harpooner’s arm, nailing the
screaming seahawk to the masthead of the
sinking Pequod—that irresistibly recall
Victor Hugo. But “Moby Dick” as a whole
and complete book—in its detailed poetical
description of fact and its also detailed
poetical description of what is beyond fact—
is unlike any other book that was ever writ-
ten. It is a unique thing in the literature
of the world.

Another Letter of Hewlett’s
“T.B.C.’s” article (R.P. 10/6/’26) on
“The Letters of Maurice Hewlett” was of
peculiar interest to me for two reasons;
first, that I have long had an admiration and
even affection for several of Hewlett’s books,
and, second, that I only just missed having
a part in the book under discussion.
The title of “T.B.C.’s” article is a mis-
nomer, for Hewlett was not “a gentle
knight.” Knightly he w 7 as, but in regard to
the epithet, one who knew him intimately,
writing a few weeks after his lamented
death, said : “As he was strong of will, he
did not suffer fools gladly. He was a ruler
rather than a diplomat. But in spite of a
certain harshness of manner he. was the
truest of friends to those who earned his
friendship.”
Hewlett’s fame will rest upon certain of
his novels, above all, I think, upon “The
Queen’s Quair.” This it was that inflamed
my own enthusiasm. It deals with the
pathetic story of the luckless Mary Queen
of Scots, a story which unfortunately few,
if any, seem to approach without a strong
religious (or rather sectarian) bias. For the
adroit and subtle Mary determined that, if
she had to die, she w'ould die in a manner
calculated to make her numbered by the
faithful amongst the martyrs of her church,
tlt is a curious fact, by the w r ay, that in
the recently-printed second series of “The
Fugger News Letters”—the Fuggers were
the sixteenth-century prototypes of the
present-day Rothschilds —we learn for the
first time that on the scaffold the unhappy
woman publicly denounced both the King of
Spain and the Pope for having broken their
promises and deserted her.) Hewlett’s book,
liowever, deals only with those six years of
Mary’s life between her return to Scotland
as Dowager Queen of France and Queen of
Scots and her final surrender to her enemies
after Carberry and imprisonment at Loch-
leven.
Any reader who tried to bring a balanced
judgment to the reading of “The Queen’s
Quair” would find it extremely difficult not
to allow himself to be convinced by this
extraordinarily impressive book. Hewlett
may be right or he may be wrong, but the
reader —such is the novelist’s wonderful
power of writing—will find it very easy to
believe that his view is the correct one. To me
the matter was of some importance, for my
views of the unfortunate Queen of Scots
would inevitably percolate, despite all my
attempts to be just, into the minds of those
young people I should have to teach the
story of the rivalry between these two won-
derful queens. Greatly daring, I therefore
decided to write to the novelist to ask him
point blank how far one placed like myself
should trust his version of history. His
letter in reply I reproduce below as, I think,
an interesting pendant to “The Letters of
Maurice Hewlett.” A copy of this letter,
which I prized very highly, I forwarded to
Laurence Binyon, to whom the editing of
the letters had been entrusted. It was sent
as soon as I noticed the announcement of
the book in Methuen’s catalogue. Writing
to me from the British Museum, under date
January 12, 1926, the distinguished poet
and playwright said :
It was a great pleasure to get your letter,
enclosing one from Maurice Hewlett. I am sorry
that it arrived too late for the book. My edition
of the letters was all in print in August last and
was to have been published in the autumn. It has
been held up by the strike in the book trade, I
believe, and is not yet out, though I suppose it may
appear any day now. If it had been in time, I
should have been glad to insert your letter. The
literary executrix put a letter in the papers about
two years ago or more, asking for the loon of
correspondence of M.H.’s, but it’s easy to miss those
things. There must be many interesting letters by
Hewlett which we didn’t get; but the selection I
have made is quite good reading, I think.
I knew Hewlett very well for the last 10 years
of his life and was very fond of him.... And it is
good to know that through my poems I have friends
so far away.
I trust Mr. Biuyon will forgive my thus giv-
ing this little glimpse into his workshop.
I append a copy of Maurice Hewlett’s
letter, which the reader may care to cut out
and paste into a spare page of the “Letters.”
It may be added that on receiving it I was
not a little inquisitive to discover whether
it would be written in ordinary workaday
English or in the robust full-blooded stylo
of “The Queen’s Quair”: —
Old Rectory, Broadchalke, Salisbury, 11/11 /’l7.
Dear Mr. Welsh, —I have had many kind letters
from Australia, but none kinder than yours. I am
proud to read what you say of “The Queen’s Quair,”
which was the book of all of them which cost me
most to do. I believe it is all quite true to history
and in my own mind am certain that I have got
Queen Mary whole within its covers.
I convinced, much against his will, Andrew Lang
of it.
Your suggestion of Charles and Strafford as a sub-
ject is very interesting, and might have spurred
me on, once upon a time, to attempt it. But not
now. I feel certain that I have said my say in
that particular form of words. Anything else I
may do _ will be in verse—with which I began to
work, with which I shall end. I should like you
to read “The Song of the Plow.” There is more
England in that than in anything elae I have ever
done. , , ~
There is a camp of your young men about three
miles from this place. Magnificent creatures they
are, too. The future of the world is in their
hands, and nobody need be afraid of what they
will make of it. It was fully time that the .New
World came in to restore the moral balance ol
the old. —Yours always sincerely, M. Hewlett.
This glimpse of a fine writer and noble
gentleman may be concluded with a sugges-
tion. On one ocasion when I ventured to
suggest to Norman Lindsay that The
Queen’s Quair” would form a subject - pecu-
liarly suited to his talents, he told me that
he had long been attracted by Hewlett s
“Little Novels of Italy” and had once almost
determined to illustrate these lovely tales.
Other work intervening, however, had pre-
vented Lis carrying out this resolve. If our
Australian artist will not adopt my sugges-
tion, there is an alternative. “The Queen s
Quair” came out as a serial years ago (in
11)03, to be precise) in the Pale Mate
Magazine and was sumptuously illustrated
by Maurice Grieffenhagen. Gould not Hew-
lett’s publishers be sufficiently enterprising to
hunt up these interesting illustrations and
issue them in a worthy edition of this im-
pressive and masterly book?
ALEX. C. WELSH.
Writing for Vaudeville
Some years ago, when the tide of pros-
perity w r as very low, I decided to try writ-
ing vaudeville material, having had some
stage training and much experience with
stock companies. My first effort “clicked.
I received ten shillings for it, and it proved
“successful.” I might have got more, but
with ' a bare cupboard and Sunday to pass
I couldn’t lay my hands on that halt-
sovereign quickly enough.
My next effort was turned down by two
managers, but the late Harry Clay thought
something of it, and asked its' price. “Ten
pounds,” I s,aid boldly. “Fair price,” said
Harry ; “come in to-morrow night.” I did,
and he paid me a fiver for it. That fiver
lifted me to a delirious state. I wrote dozens
of revues after that, getting as much as
£2 2s. per week for a ’script, which usually
ran for four weeks. At one time I had four
revues on the circuit. Then others crept into
the game. Performers mostly. And being
a non-performer I soon received only the
crumbs. Eventually I sold the Australian
rights of 27 revues to a Brisbane manager
at a fair price. Four others were sold to a
show going to India, but I got no money.
And as they were not copyrighted, I have no
redress. After that I got in touch with an
American agency, and paid a few dollars
(three dollars a ’script) to have my matter
listed. Though I have received requests for
more work, and have been told that the stuff
in hand has been put before managers, I
have received no American money. lam
now afraid to w,rite to them for fear they
may charge storage.
By this time many illusions had vanished.
So I turned to playwriting, having read
that the author of “The Boomerang” netted
£2OO,fMX). I said to myself, “Even with a
few noughts off, it would still look respect-
able to me.” I wrote three plays, two com-
edies and one drama. One comedy I sub-
mitted to a manager who said he liked it,
but advised me to write shockers with earls,
dukes and London Bridges in them. I gave
him up. Yet I knew he was only reflecting-
his audiences’ taste. The second comedy was
submitted to a party nearer the metropolitan
centre, and was paid, the greatest honor a
’script can be paid, if the late John Cos-
grove’s word is worth anything. It was
stolen. That encouraged me; I kept on
for a while, but the drinks seemed a long
time coming, so I left the saloon-bar and
walked into vaudeville with “sketches.” It
was a hard road, and boot-leather was dear;
still, by advertising, I bought the morning
chop—with amateur money. The profes-
sional was a different proposition: he will
not buy material. I have proved it. As
Nat Phillips said : “There are only 40 thieves
in the business, and Mo and myself are look-
ing for the other 38.” In a sense, the per-
former is not to blame. Everybody’s doing
it, so why be the fool?
The lack of organisation in this young
country is to blame. In America there are
numerous agents who practically hire teams
to play the sketches, who extract a good per-
centage of the pay-roll, or collect the lot and
pay the performers. Here there are no
agents, so the sketch-writer has to sell his
’script right out. And thus, instead of get-
ting hundreds of pounds for a ’script, he
gets perhaps five —or has his work stolen.
One turn came to this country from America
—a sketch for five people. It played for
seven years in America, a season here and
a season in South Africa; and all the time
its author was collecting royalties. Is it any
wonder that the author of this sort of matter
leaves his Australian home, if he can, and
seeks his chop afield?

Science and the Plain Man
Too long has the plain' man walked softly
in the presence of Science. Too long has he
asked of science bread' and been given a
stone. Too long has he said amen to all
science has had to say, and now he is tired
and disillusioned. Science seems to have
achieved great things; but the plain man is
not satisfied either physically or spiritually.
It appears to him, for he judges ever by re-
sults, that the benefits of science are more
imaginary than real. Although he must fall
back on science to pull him out of the mire
of sickness and disease, he is beginning to
wonder if it was not science that pushed
him into the mire in the first place; indeed,
he sees that in most cases the best that
science can do is to remove obstacles and let
Nature get in her work of healing.
Science has given him the convenience of
electric light—and weakened his eyesight by
the use of it. Science has given the man
soft and delicate foods; roller flour; foods
kept in cool storage; fruits and vegetables
out of season. And science has taken toll
of his teeth and digestion to such an extent
that he is seriously thinking of returning to
a simpler life —if he can tear himself from
the many tentacles that science has flung
around him.
The mental condition of the plain man is
no better for the gigantic work of science.
Night is turned into day. The ears are deaf-
ened by the roar of industrial machinery,
The nerve is racked by the strenuousness of
modern life. All the outcome of science.
Spiritually, science would strip man of his
very dreams and of his faith in the Unseen,
Science says there exists nothing but facts,
and tbat facts are truth. “I delve for truth,
I sift for truth; truth is my goal.” All that
science will acknowledge is material. The
plain man feels that truth is more than this,
He can explain his ideas poorly, but with
dim vision he thinks lie sees that truth is
what is. He has found that he can neither
live nor die without a belief in something
greater than himself which appeals to his
soul—a part of man’s economy that science
will not consider, as it cannot be handled or
defined. So the plain man is wondering
whether the prophets and poets in their in-
spired outpourings are not nearer truth than
science is
Science were wiser at times to go to the
Bible for verification than expect the Bible
to conform to it; for science changes its
mind every few years. Only a few con-
tnries ago science discovered the earth was
round. The Bible said the same thing over
20(H) years ago. Science says where there is
pitch there is- oil, and the young scientist of
a few years ago persuaded the Standard Oil
Co.’s directors to dig wells on the banks of
the Nile, all because the Bible said that the
mother of Moses daubed his little ark with
pitch. The wells were sunk and oil found
some 3500 years after the writing.
Instances like that tend to turn tlie mind
of 111 A til uin man from lii« blind oil ntnanpn
ot the plain man trom 11s blind allegiance
to science, especially as he cannot quell the
cravings of his spiritual nature. He has
read “Man shall not live by bread alone” —
and he is finding it true.

Old Superstitions
It is strange how grammarians and men
of letters continue to use the worn-out old
touchstones and to cling to the old super-
stitions. A case occurred recently in the
Australasian :
Although marred by a split infinitive, Miss May
Hughes’s poem, “Sorrow,” in “Little Things and
Other Poems,” is a sincere and moving piece.
The rule regarding the split infinitive is arbi-
trary and absurd. The mere fact that the
infinitive is two words, and not one, would
seem to suggest that they were intended to
be parted on occasion. That often a sentence
is less clumsy with the infinitive split does
not admit of argument, while the adverb is
often stressed quite differently when this
form is used. ...
I have frequently had arguments with
friends regarding the verb “to swank.” They
maintain that it is a slang-word and that
none with pretensions to literary style would
use it. On the other hand I claim that the
first aim of literature or language is to ex-
press thought or feeling, and that there is
no word that is not slang even remotely
synonymous with “swank.” The pedants
usually suggest “to behave in a conceited
manner” or something similar, but ( swank
and conceit are not the same. A “swank
is not necessarily conceited; he always tries
to appear to be, but often he only acts, lms
especially applies to boys. Anyhow, “to be-
have in a conceited manner” is clumsy
enough to ruin any saying, the brevity ot
which may be intended to be the Soul of
Wit. , „ .
I do not suggest that every latest slang-
word should be, or could be, used to express
our deepest sentiments, but until the critics
realise that the English language is a vigor-
ous and growing force they will remain not
critics, but pedants. Our mother tongue is
a luxurious tree, and, while there is a living
writer speaking to living people, it is safe
to say that all the efforts of the pedants
to ring-bark it will fail.

A Satchel of Books
The Venture Booh, by HI in or Mordaunt (John
Lane). As a relaxation from the strenuous work
of writing fiction Mrs. Mordaunt here chronicles l.er
travels. The book is full of action and color, guilt-
less of statistics, and illustrated with the writer's own
sketches.
The Conflict of Science and Religion, by IC. C.
Wheare (Brown, Prior). An anonymous friend of
Scotch College, Melbourne, offered a generous prize
to the student who showed the highest merit as an
essayist. This pamphlet is the work of the prizeman,
one of the senior students, and bears witness at any
rate to ins diligent reading. It is carefully written
and praiseworthy.
Tasmanians To-day, Alexander Gurney (Davies *
Bros., Ltd.). A collection of caricatures and
sketches by a young Tasmanian artist whose work
Bulletin readers know. The artist’s subjects include
most of the prominent men in public, professional
and commercial life in the Speck, from its chief
optimist, Sir Jim O’Grady, to the gentleman who
“is a tailor by profession but a cowkeeper by
inclination.” A very creditable portfolio.
“Jucky Roo” : Guy Innes (R.P. 1 /7/’26) is wrong
when he quotes the Colonel’s reference to “Helen
Blazes—an old flame of his” and says it’s in Kipling’s
“My Sunday at Home.” There is no Colonel in that
story, and no such phrase. What story is it in?
“J.L.C.”: “A.H.G.”: (R.P. l/7/’26) is wrong in
stating that Irish bishops go to Rome every five
years to seek permission to continue ruling their
dioceses. Once a bishop is appointed, not even the
Holy See can remove him except for wilful and
persistent erroneous teaching, scandalous conduct or
some equally grave matter. The purpose' of the
visit required of bishops is to pay personal respect
to the Primacy of the Pope and to make full report
of diocesan affairs. This is simply a case of the
“personal touch” which the work-a-day world finds
so efficacious in these times.


“I’ve fitted these —why shouldn’t
I smile?”
“Yes, why shouldn’t I! I came to realise that fuming
and frowning about the roads didn’t help my old ’bus
over the rough places, or lessen the amount of work I
was called upon to do tightening bolts and nuts. Nor did
it ever lighten the anxiety about the possibility of a spring
breaking.
“A bright idea struck me. SINCE I COULD NOT
SUIT THE ROAD TO THE CAR, WHY NOT TRY
TO SUIT THE CAR TO THE ROAD ! I got busy
quick and lively!
“Boys, believe me, the ‘straightest’ of my dear old
maiden aunts couldn’t take exception to my driving
language now. Why, I’ve almost forgotten how to sound
a good, forceful d —n; —and I used to be so good at it, too!
“Follow me. You’ve done it before, you know! Get
a set of Stewarts; they’re just splendid the way they
control the springs. Really, I hear drivers rousing about
roads that did not worry me or my passengers a bit. I’m
for the Stewart every time!’*

Knowledge.
I looked into the wise man’s bowl with its
clouds of mystery;
And out of the curling incense-smoke I saw
the soul of me.
“Look!” said the wise old man, “and see,
what time and the gods have made!”
And I looked deep down to the depths of
truth though my heart hung back afraid.
I saw myself as one who dwelt, warm-
breathed with passion’s fire,
Among the odorous tangle-ways of golden-
boughed desire
Yearning to pluck a full ripe fruit, yet,
coward, plucking naught
For fear that it proved less exquisite and
fine than I had thought!
♦
I was as one who walked alone, a song on
my fresh young lips,
With the grass-roots round my bare white
feet and a vine-wreath round my hips,
Fleeing away to the small furred things and
the peace of the bird-filled wood,
Away from the sneering eyes of them who
had never understood!
I was as one who faltering prayed to a God
that no man knew,
Sanctified by the sun and wind and kissed
with the morning dew,
Following on where beauty led, lured by a
fitful gleam,
Shutting my eyes to the sterner things and
holding fast to my dream!
I looked into the wise man’s bowl and I saw
in the cloudy glass
Shadowy drifts of love and hate and things
of the world that pass.
Only this I saw in the glass shall change,
shall change but never die—
This little soul a-journeying, this wild soul
that is I!

At Katoomba: The Pilgrims.
All day blithe folk, folk young and old,
With eyes and hearts elate,
Have trod the deep, green sanctuaries —
To arching fronds and ancient trees
And hidden waters, sweet and clear,
For ages consecrate.
All day at Beauty’s many, shrines .
They have been worshipph|'s,
Drunk in her incense, stood 1 amazed
Before her, soul and heart upraised,
Surged by the sweet compelling power
That ever more is hers.
By noon and lustrous afternoon,
Through misty green and gold,
Their feet have strayed, till now at last,
Their hours of high enthralment past, .
Home, home they come, like folk who troop
From some cathedral old.
From dusky deeps, moss-floored,' rock-walled,
Slow, slow of foot, they turn,
And Beauty’s altars leave behind, ■
Oharmed pilgrims all, that weucjf and wind
From some cathedral, where the lights,
Pure-flamed, no longer burn.
Enriched, enthralled, home, home they troop
With lifted hearts and heads,
Yet Beauty unperturbed by night
Keeps pace with them on slope and height,
And far and near, , with lavish hands,
Her grace and glamor sheds.
To night, to sable night, their day
Its radiant reign resigns,
Yet through the frosty air they see,
While faint stars glimmer pallidly,
The. moon, a silver scimitar.
Above dark mountain pines.

THE DREAM OF GEORGE TURNER.
So many politicians come and go that Aus-
tralia has almost forgotten James George
Drake, who was Postmaster-General in the
first Commonwealth Government, Attorney-
General in the second and Vice-President
of the Executive Council in the fourth.
The old man, now in his 77 th year,
has taken up the pen again—he was
a journalist in the ’seventies —to record
his unfading impressions of George
Turner, whom he justly calls “a splendid
Treasurer, the best that could have been
found for our newly-fledged Federation”:
and portion of his Sydney Sun article should
be read as a daily lesson by the present
Commonwealth Treasurer: —
Xlierr was one subject which Turner had made
peculiarly his own, and upon which I was in thorough
agreement with him —the transference of the State
debts to the Commonwealth. At the conventions
that preceded Federation he took the most prominent
part in the debates on the subject, and once he
actually succeeded in getting through an amendment
making the taking over of the State debts as at
the time of Federation compulsory; but that amend
mrnt was rescinded. The exercise of the power was
left to the wisdom of the Parliament. The State
debts have never been taken over. If they had been
there would not have arisen any awkward question
of the distribution of surplus revenue, because fhat
surplus would have gone to pay the interest upon
the State debts, under the provisions of the Con-
stitution.
“Why has that power never been exercised?”
asks George Turner’s colleague and faith-
ful friend. The answer is, because a breed
of little Treasurers followed the man whose
ideas were great.
* * * #
Unfortunately for Australia, Turner had
retired from politics when the Braddon
clause of the Constitution, by virtue of which
the States received three-fourths of the cus-
toms and excise revenue for 10 years,
expired. That was the golden period for
taking over the State debts. The amount
returned by the Commonwealth to the States
in 1900-11 (£5,492,000) would have almost
paid their interest bill < £9.199,000). More-
over, at the referendum held in conjunction
with the 1910 election, the people empowered
the Federal authority to acquire all the State
debts (its powers had previously been limited
by the words “debts as existing at the estab-
lishment of the Commonwealth”), simul-
taneously rejecting a swindling proposal that
the States should get _2ss. per head p.a. out of
the customs and excise revenue for all time.
But the Fisher Government, which came
into office at this juncture, was less inter-
ested in financial reform than in vote-catch-
ing schemes like the maternity bonus. It
put through its Surplus Revenue Act, which
awarded the States 255. per head for 10
years, and let the State-debts question drop.
Had George Turner been in office and in
his old form, there would have been no tem-
porising and no loosely-worded Sqrplus
Revenue measure. The States would have
had to surrender their liabilities, and with
them the privilege of borrowing except
through the Commonwealth, which could
have made its consent conditional on the
establishment of a sinking fund. In that
case the State debts would not have grown
from £267,127,000 in 1911 to £603,334,000
in 1925, with results demoralising to this
generation and perhaps disastrous to pos-
terity. Neither would the people be plagued
with the unutterable conditions arising from
the fact that income-tax and death duties
are levied by the Commonwealth and all the
States; land-tax by the Commonwealth and
five States: entertainment taxes' by the
Commonwealth and three States: and so on.
The present Treasurer, to do him justice,
made some attempt to check State borrow-
ing ; and lie is not wholly responsible that
the measure of success achieved was small.
He also sees that order will somehow have
to be plucked out of the chaos of taxes and
tax-gatherers. But his plans for levying the
land, inheritance and entertainments taxes
in 1926-27 and handing the receipts to the
States, of abandoning those taxes in i:>~ i-
-28 and with them “40 p.c. of our income-
tax,” and, above all, of imposing special
customs duties on motor chassis, tyres and
petrol, etc., and letting the States have the
proceeds for road expenditure, are less likely
to bring order out of chaos than to make
confusion worse confounded.
Were a George Turner in Page’s situa-
tion he would indisputably cancel the per
capita payments. With the object of ending
the taxation chaos lie would also be willing
to give up the land, amusements and inheri-
tance taxes. But, unlike Page, he wouldn’t
think of parting with his income-tax or any
portion of it. On the contrary, he would in-
sist on the States abandoning their income-
taxes. He would point out, in this connec-
tion. that the States managed with
£2,869.000 of income-tax revenue in 1913-14
(the Federal land, inheritance and amuse-
ments taxes yielded £4,393 500 last year) ;
that they have no war expenditure to meet,
whereas the Commonwealth has to find no
less than £29.000,000 p.a.; that Australia
being a heavily-indebted country with few
established industries, a lot of rocky ones
and no revenue-producing colonies or depen-
dencies, it can stand only one income-tax,
and that the Commonwealth is the obvious
authority to impose it. More especially as
the interest on war and post-war loans is,
generally speaking, taxable by the Common-
wealth, but not by the States. And a
Turner aiming at the seuaration of Federal
and State finance would not suggest special
customs duties to provide the States with
road funds. So wildly inconsistent a scheme
would never occur to him. But he would go
baldheaded for taking over State debts. With
seven millions of per capita money and the
difference between tax-revenue abandoned
and acquired, which might amount to an-
other seven millions, he would most likely
arrange to take over 50 p.c. of the debts for
a start —the State interest bill amounted to
£27.407,000 last year—drawing on Common-
wealth Bank and note-issue profits for his
sinking-fund. If Page were made of the
same stuff the acquisition of State debts
would be the most important feature of his
Government’s financial proposals. But Page
falters where a Turner would firmly tread.
THE MOTOR-TRACTION CRAZE.
“Mr. Hughes (N.SAV.) stated that the day of
the railway was gone, or at least going. The
question was whether it was cheaper to build roads
than railways. He believed that roads could be
built at one-sixth or one-tenth of the cost of
railways. The time bad come for the Commonwealth
to realise that the day of the internal combustion
engine had arrived, and that motor traction was the
conveyance of the future. He hoped that they would
not spend another penny unnecessarily on railways.”
The matter under discussion in a desultory
sort of way was a line to the Northern
Territory, and Hughes generally has a
spasm like that when the Federal Possession
is mentioned. Then roads and motors become
his hobby, as Empire penny postage was
that of the late Henniker Heaton. But
it isn’t so tangible; in fact, it seems to
point to very little except letting 523,620
square miles of Federal property slide a
while longer.
• * * *
Road-making is a much older art than
railway-building, in Australia as elsewhere,
and should be further advanced. In N. S.
Wales, where it began, tliere were, by recent
returns, 104,764 miles of road, but 15,695
ipiles were only “formed.” and *82.512 were
only “cleared,” and 33,203 miles were “natu-
ral surface.” This left 23.354 miles
described as “metalled, gravelled, ballasted,
etc.,” and sections of this get a daily or
hourly mention in the press to the general
effect that it is “practically impassable.”
The aggregate or average cost of getting it
into, and keeping it in. this state is difficult
to arrive at. Australian roads in general
depend for their construction and support
on local taxes, local loans. State taxes. State
loans, Federal taxes and Federal loans, and
some few of them were good roads before
State or Federal Governments existed,
though they may have degenerated since.
It is now proposed to allocate a special or
extra 35 millions (20 Federal and 15 State)
spread over 10 years for the improvement
of “national highways. The designation is
vague, but a recent “N.S.W. Official Year
Book” alleged that there were 58 miles of the
“national” article in the Ma State, 40 being
“metalled, gravelled, ballasted, etc.,” 16
“formed only” and two merely “cleared.’
Some small rare bits of ideal path are
being made in the metropolis, but the pro-
cess is very slow and the cost very high.
For the rest, there are streets, as near as
Matraville or the “model” but dead suburb
of Daceyville, on which it is follv to risk
a car even at a slow pace, and Sunday-
motorists find consolation and guidance in
a weekly report about which of the short-
lived highways have gone to the dogs since
last report.
* * * *
Whatever may be the cause, it is a general
rule in this country that the worse rail-
way is less bumpy all through than the
greater part of the best country road. It
never hangs out for an indefinite period the
sign “Closed for Repairs” merely by rehson
of ordinary wear and tear, nor is the train
expected to leave its regular path and find its
way through the bush to the other side of the
stoppage. Experiences of the sort may hap-
pen quite casually to one who drives a vehicle
between Sydney and Parramatta or Sydney
and Goulburn ; but: even the most backbloeky
branch-line contrives to be above such unties.
Nor is it customary for railway travellers to
get behind their vehicle and push, nor to
jhelp wearily at digging trains out of a hole
at that dead of night when John Moore
was buried. Adventure like this was lately
shown to be possible even on the new and
much-advertised Prince’s Highway. It may
be that motor traction is cheap, as alleged :
still, if its finances could be definitely sorted
out, it is difficult to picture it carrying a
ton of goods 100 miles for 10s. 9d. as a
steady thing, much less humping a ton of
manure that distance for 3s. sd. If the
road vehicle has really arrived, as the agi-
tated Hughes alleges, it should have done so
in the United States, where local cars are
cheap, and petroleum leaps out of the earth
gratis or thereabouts in all manner of places,
and where the motor mania lately became
more intense than in all the rest of the
world put together. There the rail wavs
almost thought once that their end had
come. Rut they found it a false alarm. The
record is only to 1923; but so far as it goes
it reads as follows:
Tons or Freight ox U.S. Railways.
1920“ A 2,269,983,278 I 1922 .. 1,840,954,570
1921 . . 1,690,762,695 j 1923 . . 2,333,600,764
The last was the best figure the U.S. had
known, and though the recovery in pas-
senger traffic was less marked there was
a recovery. Perhaps the day of the motor
arrived in 1921, and went away again.
* * * *
The position is that Australia is a fair
success at making railways and, for various
reasons, a rather poor hand at constructing
the common mud highway. And while it
can build both trains and motor-cars (though
somehow it rather imports motor-ears) it
produces abundance of fuel for the former
and hardly a pint for the latter. A great
deal is published about the bright hopes
of finding liquid fuel by boring for it; but
thus far no oil has resulted, and the bright
hopes are getting dimmer and are being
penned into a couple or three comparatively
Small areas. Also a great deal is said about
the manufacture of power alcohol. In this
connection the prickly-pear has been dis-
covered several times as an assured source
of supply, but the alcohol has never arrived.
Cassava (tapioca) and other vegetables have
been recommended, and blighted by the dis-
covery that too much expensive labor is
involved. Sanguine persons think they see
their way to produce at least one day’s
supply per annum out of the sugar industry,
but nothing of importance has happened yet.
It would be a rare species of madness to
cultivate dependence, as regards the traffic
of a huge section of a continent, on imported
fuel, to say nothing of extensive dependence,
on imported vehicles. The supply might
stop, in whole or great part, through the
suppliers requiring the substance for their
own uses; or through war; or through this
country striking a financial crisis and its
cheque going bad. Then Australia would
stop likewise, which would be bad for Aus-
tralia. Of course motor traction has its uses.
But to suggest it as an alternative to railway-
building over wide areas where road-making
and maintenance are expensive would be mad
anywhere, and madder in Australia than any-
where else —at any rate, till an assured
output of local liquid fuel is in sight. It
would be a blessed thing if \V. M. Hughes,
assuming that he must have a distinctive
fad, would find a harmless one. The restora-
tion of the House of Stuart would be as
good as any.
THE SLUM POLITICS OF SYDNEY.
Sydney’s Tammany Hall has lately been a
good deal annoyed by old-fashioned Labor-
ites. A suburban Labor league, to begin
with, objected to Council jobs (about 2000
have been created in 18 months of Tammany
control) being reserved for city-dwellers,
largely occupants of slums and doss-houses,
nominated by Labor aldermen. It said it
had always believed that the Labor party
stood for equality of opportunity and the
selection of the best man for the billet, with-
out any racial, religious, party or parochial
qualification or disqualification. Tammany
was indignant at being reminded of these
worn-out beliefs, but didn’t let its feelings
interrupt the work of finding light municipal
employment, at a lot more than ncm-
municipal rates of nay, for friends who can
be trusted to vote the ticket at the election
next year. And any friend of an alderman
who pays five bob a week or so for a doss-
house room or part of a humpy within the
city boundaries “during the six months next
preceding the first, day of May in the year in
which a . roll is to be prepared”—it will
be for the vote.
* * * *
Certain good Labor women who have been
trying to get a municipal playground for
the children in perhaps the slunimiest quar-
ter of Woolloomooloo have also been giving
Tammany trouble. When the Civic Reform-
ers were in office portion of Charles-street,
Woolloomooloo, was resumed for conversion
into a playground: but Tammany came in
before the proceedings had gone far and
applied the closure. It was pointed out that
the inhabitants of the resumed area would
have to move into another neighborhood if
their dingy cottages were demolished, and
the Labor aldermen might lose their votes.
It was also explained that the scheme would
deprive a “comrade” of a vested interest in
a bottle-yard, and vested interests in bottle-
yards are not to be sacrificed for the sake
of a lot of kids. The kids, it was suggested,
might play on a kindergarten ground, which
is not public property, or they might be given
a piece of Phillip Park, which is not more
than half a mile away. If the Cliarles-street
playground were made they might be. pes-
tered by the '‘undesirables” who lurked in
the neighborhood, and then their last state
would be worse than the first.. To Tammany's
chagrin, these attempts to justify its depar-
ture from the declared Labor policy—which,
according to the La bob Daily, “is to establish
children's playgrounds throughout the city
area” —were treated by Miss May Matthews,
one of the Labor women aforesaid, with open
contempt. Miss Matthews, who has given
many proofs of devotion to the Cause, wrote
to Premier Lax o’s paper saying she was “at
a loss to understand the attitude of the
Labor aldermen.” Curtly dismissing the
“dispossession-of-tenants objection, which is
alwavs used when resumption of city pro-
perty is proposed”—and invariably rejected
when it suits Tammany to reject it. as has
happened in hundreds of cases —the lady
proceeded:—
There is no playground for children in this area,
except the kindergarten school, which is not a public
playground. The residents have enough spirit to
protect the children against the intrusion of undesir-
ables. Almost any arrangement would be preferable
to the children playing - in the streets, as they do
now. The tragedy of the whole thing is that the
mothers have no votes.
In spite of this indignant protest the play-
ground scheme was vetoed at the last Council
meeting on the motion of Alderman Holds-
woßTir, who represents’ the ward and is also
one of the M’s.L.A. for Sydney. The same
Holdsworth on the same occasion got the
projected purchase of eight British motor-
cars at £312 10s. each, as recommended by
the chief mechanical engineer, turned down
in favor of a deal in foreign cars —four
American at £595 apiece and three Italian
at £425. Concerning which one of the
Reform alderman said, with a sidelong glance
at an exuberant young Laborite who had
avowed his friendship for a gentleman in the
motor-car trade and his anxiety to get busi-
ness for him: “There have been several scan-
dals over the purchase of cars for the City
Council, but this is the ‘hottest’ of all.”
Alderman Holdsworth keeps a pub at
Woolloomooloo. Alderman Burke, who
is also one of the M’s.L.A. for Syd-
ney (he is senior member, in fact),
confided to a Royal Commissioner that
he earned part of Iris income by hang-
ing round racecourses. These gentlemen’s
ways of getting a living are, of course, their
own business, but their political advance-
ment is significant of the change thnt has
come over the Labor party. What with
saloon-keepers and gamblers, slum polities
and “hot” scandals, multiplication of jobs for
men who will vote the ticket and sullen hos-
tility to Britain, the Sydney municipal
branch of that party grows more and more
like the Tammany beyond the Pacific whose
sordid tale lias been told by historians of
New York.
WITCH-DOCTORS, ANCIENT AND
MODERN.
The Government of Victoria is still anxious
—though not too anxious—to go forward in
its crusade against Ah Why, the Chinese
herbalist. Consideration of the science of
quackery in all its branches leads to the
melancholy conclusion that in this as in
other things the Allan Ministry is several
versts behind the times. An Why is of
small importance nowadays in the pseudo-
scientific world. He is. if anything, deserv-
ing of a subsidy, for he is being rapidly
driven out of business, and it seems the
regular thing nowadays, if you cannot dig
enough out of your mine to keep you, to
ask the Government to make up the balance.
Really a new competitor has arisen who has
transcended Ah Why— in effect. lliram K.
Swashbuckler. D.C.. P.S.C., Professor of
Oscilloclastic Spondylotherapeutics (gradu-
ate of the Oshkosh School of Oscilloclastic
Spondylo therapy),
Hiram K. comes of an ancient and power-
ful dynasty which had its origin in the
TJ.S.A. His first great progenitor was
Elisha Perkins, born before his time in
1741, when even such a brilliant inspiration
as the metallic tractor yielded only a mod-
erate competence to its host. Followed the
hommopathists. They started in the revela-
tion accorded to the German chemist
Hahnemann that like cures like. A remedy
prescribed for girls afflicted with great grief
and suffering was tears drawn from a girl
afflicted with great grief and suffering. By 1900
homoeopathy could point to 22 colleges in tbo
U.S.A. Last year there were but two. An-
other prince of the house had appeared to
push the other off his throne.
On August 6,182 S, in Lee County, Vir-
ginia, Andrew Still urns born, and angels
sang at his birth. (Incidentally, his great
grandfather first settled in Buncombe
County, N. Carolina.) Still became a free-
lance doctor amongst the Shawnee Indians,
and one day, while he was brooding over
some bones ring up from a native graveyard,
the divine vision came to him that, as the
skeleton is obviously the most; important
part of the human body and the backbone
the most crucial part of the skeleton, all dis-
ease must be controlled by the. vertebra.
He went in great excitement to Baldwin
University, Kansas, which promptly turned
him out. The institution knew not what
it did. Still was to return in triumph, to
see his idea made the foundation of a cult,


t.ie land covered with osteopathic colleges,
thousands of osteopaths let loose upon the
population, and State Governments intro-
ducing laws which raised osteopathy to a
science; he himself was to die secure in the
belief of the divine origin of his revelation,
leaving behind an autobiography which is
already invested with the sanctity of a Bible,
a host of myths about his miracles and the
toll owing significant comment on a brother’s
conversion to the faith: “I believed Jim’s
brain would ripen in time, so I let him pray
until at the end of 18 years he said: ‘Halle-
lujah, you are right; there is money in it,
and I want to study osteopathy.’ ”
The next great figure on Hiram’s familv-
tree is I). I). Palmer. Twenty years after
osteopathy was born. B. J. Palmer told
under oath in the witness-box the story of
how liis father, D. D. Palmer, of Daven-
port, U.S.A., had found the janitor of a build-
ing stone-deaf, how the sufferer declared that
his deafness started when lie heard some-
thing go pop in his spine, how Palmer laid
him on a cot, found his spine hideously dis-
placed and pressing on the nerves, how lie
reasoned with himself that, if the displace-
ment caused the deafness, by removing it
he would cure the trouble, and how he
promptly straightened the spine and imme-
diately restored the janitor’s hearing. Thus
was chiropractic born. To day, although no-
body has yet been able to produce a single
example of a displaced vertebra pinching a
nerve or a solitary proof that a chiropractor
has ever straightened a spine by tapping it,
chiropractic colleges cover the land, while
ihe Palmer Institute is a huge collection of
buildings, owning its own radio station, and
belching forth annually 8000 to 5000 dis-
ciples, fully equipped to struggle victoriously
with disease in all its forms.
Nevertheless, despite triumphs such as
this, chiropractic was soon to be displaced.
In 1804, in San Francisco, Albert Abrams
was born. He became a capable but not
brilliantly successful medico until the elec-
tronic theory, of which Sir Ernest Ruther-
ford is the most brilliant exponent, came to
his notice. Since every atom of matter is
in a constant state of vibration, blood must
have its definite rate, and that rate must
vary according to the condition of its owner.
Thus reasoned the pioneering mind of
Abrams. It should therefore be possible to
d<”. ise a machine to measure these vibrations.
He went into conference with a radio ama-
teur, and the Abrams box was born. By
putting a drop of a patient’s blood in this
apparatus, Abrams was able to say whether liis
client was suffering from cancer or gonorrhoea.
Eater he found that a specimen of the suf-
ferer s handwriting would do as well. Otheij
discoveries were that the machine could dis-
tinguish grain that would germinate from
that which was -sterile, thus providing farm-
ers with a great boon ; and that it was also
able to classify eggs according to their sex
and people according to their religions. A
Methodist gave a reaction in the left lower
quarter of the abdomen, and a Baptist in
the right lower. The inventor next added
a machine for curing all diseases by restor-
lng the proper vibrations to seedy atoms, and
liis life’s work was complete. Leaving a
mrge fortune, he died in 1924; but, although
his magic box has been declared by engineers
and medical experts to be. a rogue, the great
movement lie started goes marching on.
Descendant of this long line of scientific
sagvs, Hiram IC. presents himself, and asks
to be considered. There is always the chance
that lie will get his wish, and, as in the
TT.h.A., be made a political issue. The other
day a glib Yankee got the ear of the Queens-
land Government, and that body of scientific
experts decided to hold an inquiry into the
Abrams box with a view to opening a State
witchdoctor.v at the public expense. The
N. S. Wales Government is also stated to
ha\e considered the same proposition. A
Maonland doctor prospered as an Abrams
practitioner until some ribald person sent
him a drop of blood drawn from a goat
which the magician diagnosed as that of a
human being suffering from congenital
syphilis. I was personally acquainted with
a graduate of the Palmer School of Chiro-
practic. He had been a house-agent. When
he returned with his diploma, liis first
patient was liis own son, suffering from
tubercle in the very portion of the body on
winch the chiropractor concentrates all his
healing efforts. Blood was' stronger than
professional prestige, and he handed the
sufferer over to the qualified fraternity. But
he continues to treat the spines of the out-
side public for dysentery, sarcoma and gum-
boils.
Once upon a time I watched a Dyak witch-
doctor extract a handful of pebbles from a
native patient by incantation. An educated
white woman, with stone, on hearing of this,
called in the hero. The effect was most spec-
tacular, and she was able to display enough
evidences of her late complaint to make a
necklace. These simple devices are no longer
m fashion, however, in a scientific age. The
public demands something more recondite,
uml lliram Iv. is here to oblige it. The Vic.
Government is wasting its time fretting
about An Why. It should concentrate on
Hiram.

Compulsory Car Insurance.
T he compulsory insurance of cars was advo-
ci'.ied by Deputy-President Webb in the
Federal Arbitration Court in Melbourne: he
thought it possible, though barely probable,
tka*-, even as the law stands, an action in
rem . might lie against a car, just as it lies
against a ship S Honor had been consider-
ing the case of the tramway employees, who
ouged a list of casualties to show the risks
conductors run of being swept from their
footboards by passing cars. It was pointed
out that frequently the unfortunate “tram-
lines (or their relatives, if they were killed)
were deprived of the satisfaction of collect-
ing damages from the car-owners, who in
some cases went bankrupt if damages were
awarded, and in others pleaded successfully
that they were not responsible, their "buses hav-
ing been taken out without their permission,
Ihe matter concerns many people besides
the tram-men. It is very doubtful whether
hebbs guarded opinion that an action hi
rein against • .the car which caused injury
would stand; at all events, without special
legal provision, the way would be open to
endless appeals which would eat up all the
benefit the pursuer of damages might secure.
In a large proportion of the cases in which
damages are awarded to unfortunate citizens
injured by cars, the solatium is never re-
ceived by the claimant; if the car-owners
find no other way of evading the judgment
the Bankruptcy .Court lets them through
easily. Compulsory insurance, with the
necessary buttressing provisions would not
only provide certain satisfaction for damaged
citizens, but might put a very substantial
check on the alarming growth of the motor-
accident roll; accident-insurance companies
would naturally exercise care in issuing poli-
cies, and the absolute prohibition against the
running of cars not covered by a policy would
cut out many of the most dangerous variety
of roadhogs. That is a point worthy of
consideration by all the States, but especially
by Victoria, whose list of accidents is par-
ticularly horrible.
4 ,—_
6,017,210.
Tue people who talk as if all we have to
think of is extra numbers have only got
hold of the tip of the tail of the problem,
and the tail is greasy. Last month an ofii-
cial estimate was published to the effect
that the Commonwealth’s inhabitants, as
at the end of March, had passed the six-
million mark (6,017,210 to be exact). That
was an increase of 112,018 in 12 months.
Canada added a little under 5 per cent,
to its census between 1921 and 1924, and
Australia a little over 0 per cent.; so by
comparison our growth-figure is good. But out
of the abovementioned 112,618 new people
the Northern Territory secured only 74.
The previous year it gained 59, and the year
before that 42. The increase in 1928 was
four. Northern Westralia has much the
same luck. Invariably the buk of Austra-
lia’s new inhabitants, including immigrants
who have no attachment for one part of the
country more than another, are planted
where population is thickest, land dearest
and the danger of attack least. And there
is a growing tendency to deposit the bulk in
cities, where they will have a chance to
rear inferior children and lose the pioneer-
ing instinct, if they ever had it. The num-
ber of loan millions which Federal Govern-
ments have spent, and probably lost in great
part, in the struggle to crowd Pretty-Full
Australia, while leaving its own special
property, which is Emptiest Australia, to
await the first nigger is amazing. The N.
Territory is a land of fair promise, and it
lies to a consideranie extent within the
temperate zone. In this respect it is unlike
southern Rhodesia, which is wholly tropi-
cal, and where the nopulation grows much
faster, presumably because a Government
which wasn’t wholly dead linked the place'
up with the older civilisation to the south.
The Territory, and the almost equally stag-
nant province to the west of it, iurnish a
spectacle which has no counterpart. Neither
in Canada, the United States nor South
Africa is there anything dimly resembling it.
In Canada, Alaska and Russia there are
certainly, as a learned professor of Sydney
University lately pointed out. fine specimen's
of the Empty North, but they represent tin;
kind of North which can be safely left to
care for itself. The owners would mind
little if their worst enemies invaded these
regions and took Point Barrow by storm,
especially in winter. Some theorists explain
the unfortunate and unsafe position of
this. continent by suggesting that the Aus-
tralian is possibly unfit for self-government
—that he lacks the enterprise and the origi-
nality and the imagination and the vision,
oi' something, and is over-addicted to soft-
goods apd similar gentle arts. Certainly he
has developed, for a white man, an amazing
sample of backwardness and stagnation. And
it isn’t for lack of human material. The
country gets a lot of that, and it might get
more if so much of the country wasn’t shut.
The folk who shout for more people, and
say nothing about making better use of
tin* people, are a drear and muddy crowd,
always barking up the wrong horse and put-
ting the saddle on the tree which isn’t there.
Melbourne’s Milk.
“Cow-valet” : Since Vic. Minister-of-Health
Argyle has parried with soft words the pro-
posal of Melbourne City Council to do some-
thing drastic to the city’s milk supply along
the lines of the Herron report, the Govern-
ment should at least be made to see that
decent conditions are maintained in the
dairies from which over half the population
of the State gets its cow-juice. My acquaint-
ance with Strawberry has left me with no
illusions regarding the lady; and that
acquaintance has been formed during two
full years I spent acquiring experience of the
land on a dairy-farm. Even when she is
free from tubercle, which, of course, is very
often, Strawberry is a far from spotless
animal. Her udders are nearer the earth
than anything else of her except her toe-
nails. She moves around in an environment
that is often filthy marsh in wet weather,
and in dry she is often ankle-deep in polluted
dust. Even if her teats are washed when
she comes into the shed, she is liable when
milking-time approaches to a nervous move-
ment that doesn’t improve the sanitary con-
ditions in which the teat-puller works. That
gentleman himself isn’t always as clean as he
might be, and it is not always his fault. A
form of cowpox is one of the penalties of
waiting on Strawberry. I have milked next
to men the backs of whose hands were a
mass of scabby sores. The other day outside
Melbourne I watched a boy at the game
whose claws were in this state, and when
I remarked on them he replied. “That’s no-
thing—they ’urt Dad so bad last year he
had to stop milking!” The same lad had
just knocked ofF manuring to muster his
dozen charges. He took no Turkish bath.
A little pocket of pus under the nail
is another painful affliction the milker
(and the milk) is apt to suffer from.
Sometimes a cow has had an argument
with wire and has ripped a teat. A
tin of petroleum jelly stands handy, and
the medicament is slapped on the wound, to
be milked into the bucket along with all
the rest. The injured cow is restless and
her hoofs and her tail send the liquid pave-
ment of the shed in a fine shower over
everything. Some men believe in milking
dry and some in milking wet. The wet
milker periodically squirts from one teat a
stream of milk on to first one hand and then
the other, and that is the best wash some
hands ever get. The farmer runs his milk
through a filter which, while it offers no
obstacle to the good or harmful microbe,
blocks any debris larger than a marble. The
bottoms of some cans after this process are
an interesting study. Of course, the vast
majority of farmers are conscientious, and
their dairies as spotless as a Dutch kitchen.
But the product of one indifferent cocky
gets into quite a lot of others. There is
only one remedy for hand-milking, and it is
only a partial remedy. That is healthy and
properly washed cows, subject to constant
inspection, mechanically milked by a system
which enables the fluid to be conveyed out
of range of Strawberry’s drumfire and there
released into covered cans. Until something
like this is made universal all the attention
at the consumer’s end won’t make fresh milk
as safe a guest for the baby’s stomach as
whisky is for his dad’s.
Dry Spells and Railways.
Bitter and continuous is the complaint
about “Queensland’s Drought Losses” ; it is
declared particularly that there is urgent
need for a north-west and south-east line
through the droughty West, to “link up” the
ends of the railways which strike inland
from Brisbane, Rockhampton and • Towns-
ville. But whose fault is it that the State
hasn’t got this line? The want, it was
mentioned in a recent Bl i.i.etin, was recog-
nised even in Kidstox's time, and he ceased
out of politics in 1911. As a matter of fact,
the need was recognised in Mcllwraith’s
day, 40 years ago, and a company was then
prepared to do the work in return for a
grant of 12,000,000 acres, only Griffith
and the squatters and the Labor party all
got in the way. It was a pity, for the co.
would doubtless be bankrupt by now, and
the grant dissipated ; but the railway would
remain. Nowadays, however, every allusion
to the project is more or less part of a
scheme for passing the building job on to the
Federal Treasury. It is a long time since
the State itself showed any serious desire to
tackle the problem, preferring to scatter its
energies amid a multitude of scrappy ven-
tures, which generally finish at some deserted
mine or other. The latest “Federal Year
Book” related that nine bits were under con-
struction all over the place, their mileage
being as follows :
Feluga-Cardwell .. 21 Baralaba-Castle Creek 53
Lilypond-Cardwell. . 28 Ceratodas-Monto .. 31
Many Peaks-Monto. . 15 Tara-Surat .. .. 50
Callide-Monto . . 78 Windera branch . . 12
I.ongreach-Winton . . 110
And in addition five bits were, for the time
being, not under construction, work having
left off for want of money:—
Wallaville-Calliwa 19 Winton to 37-mile peg- 37
Yaraka-Powell’s Creek 27 Mount Mollov extension 7
Uajarra-Moonah Creek 4 t
If these 572 miles had been condensed they
would have been more helpful as an aid to
the solution of the western railway problem ;
but things of that sort are scattered about
with a view to votes. There would be mighty
few immediate votes along any route which
joined up the ends of the three big lines
that jut inland from the coast; so the
Queensland Ministry is much more anxious
for the Commonwealth to do the work than
to do the work itself, however important it
may be. It is just possible that if the State
advertised for a syndicate, as Mcllwraitii
did last century, it might get its line con-
structed on land-grant principles. With
97,000,000 acres “occupied only by the
Crown,” the Crown in this connection being
to a great extent cactus and dingoes, the
dozen millions which old Thomas proposed
to give away would hardly be noticed.

Sovietism In Australia.
Nothing is. more common in history than to
see a revolution accomplished under the
(‘yes of a people who mostly know' nothing
about what has happened. The change has
only to take place gradually and without
much uproar and violence, and three citizens
out of four go on their way without knowing
or caring what the country has gone through.
Australia itself affords an example of this at
the present time. We are by degrees trans-
forming our whole system of Parliamentary
representation and refusing to recognise
what is occurring. The theoretical basis of
our representative system is the division of
the country into districts with an equal (or
approximately equal) quota of electors. In
the earlier days of the States and until re-
cently, a representative had only to consider
the wishes and interests of the' residents of
a constituency and there his worries ended.
But to-day a man may remain fast in a Legis-
lative Assembly for years, although he devotes
the minimum of attention to the requirements
of his constituency, provided he “keeps sweet”
with a party organisation, representing town
industrialists, primary producers or some
other powerfully organised or vocational in-
terest. In other words, the basis of repro-
sensation is rapidly changing. Now. what is
Sovietism ? It is simply representation based
on industrial, professional, sectarian or pos-
sibly other group considerations. It is no
use saying that Sovietism stands for murder,
outrage and confiscation, for although these
things have been largely identified with it
during the Russian revolutionary upheaval,
nevertheless they are no necessary or integral
part of a Soviet system. If this definition
be correct, then the thing already bulks
large in our Australian Assemblies. Take
the Labor party as a first example. The
average Labor representative is not half so
much concerned about loyalty to a constitu-
ency 'as about strict adherence to a plat-
form. He stands in Parliament for an in-
dustrial programme—not for an electorate,
except in a very secondary sense. Then we
have the Country party—little troubled about
electorates but greatly exercised about the
rights of primary producers. Other well-
known politicians stand for the interests of
Big Business. Then Women’s Organisations
come along and adopt some such cause as
Prohibition with such, vigor that male Par-
liamentarians or M’s.L.A. or Congressmen
in terror of their lives place the Dry slogan
at the front of their platform. So that we
have the Labor Soyiet, the Public Service
Soviet, the Big Business Soviet, the Anti-
Liquor Soviet, the Farmers’ Soviet, all fac-
tors operating in our political system. Each
of these bodies exercises enormous pressure
and can often outweigh all the other influ-
ences in a constituency. We allude to them
politely as “organisations,” and call their
salaried agents organisers or lobbyists, but
they are in effect soviets. Year by year their
power increases and that of the 'constituen-
cies diminishes. The political revolution is
in full swing under our noses and we fail to
recognise it. In the month of September,
1925, the railway employees of Queensland
took control of the lines, and defied the
Minister, the Government and the Com-
missioner so effectively that when the last-
named official was asked when the railways
would be running again he referred the
questioner to the strike committee. There
are, of course, reasons for the existence of
Sovietism. A group of business men, of
farmers, of industrial workers, naturally
combines for purposes of defence or profit,
and this combination, .just as naturally, at
length turns its attention to the legislative
machine which, ostensibly, runs the country.
And in so far as they confine themselves to
proffering help to the Government, well and
good. But they have gone far beyond that
and daily coerce legislators into accepting
proposals that they know to be vicious. Theo-
retically the member of Parliament is a free
agent. As a matter of fact he is no such
thing. And this is the essence and essential
curse of the Soviet system, that it kills in
the long run all sense of responsibility in the
elected person. So the sooner we leave off
abusing the Soviet is a purely Russian
abomination the sooner we shall cease to
humbug ourselves. It is here, too, nestling
at the very heart of things.

Motors and Roads.
Tiie new customs duties on motor chassis,
tyres and petrol and the proposal to devote
a million and a half of revenue from this
source to road betterment each year have
provoked rather fewer wails of anguish than
this paper expected. Of course, there has
been the usual batch of indignant resolutions,
from the usual quarters, based on the
assumption that Federal subsidies probably
won’t be apportioned in direct ratio to the
revenue gained from each State, but these
are beside the point. Then the motor im-
porters, whose mood seems one rather of
sorrow than of anger, talk of clapping an-
other £l5, apiece on to chassis, prices—either
this or there won’t be a reduction in price
that otherwise might have happened. As
prices, even in the height of the war infla-
tion, were not sufficiently high to prevent
this country importing more petrol-waggons
than it could honestly afford, there doesn't
seem to be very much to grieve about on this
sc-ore. On the average selling price of a
chassis in this country £l5 represents about
5 per cent., which isn’t such a whale of a
rise, after all. But despite this the dear old
Argus, which worries far more over the ini-
porters’ troubles than do the importers them-
selves, talks about duties “designed to create
a virtual monopoly for the Australian manu-
facturer,” and lands on the unsuspecting
Mr. Pratten the following crushing thump :
Jf the high-tariff theory prevails and imports are
entirely excluded from the Australian market as
time goes on, it is possible that Australian standard-
ised cars run with Australian refined oil will la-
the only motor vehicles known on Australian roads.
Success so complete, however, would defeat itself,
for it would cut off the supply of revenue from
which the roads were made.
That, of course, is quite true, but it isn't
much of an argument against attempting to
acclimatise the motor industry in Australia.
It is, however, a logical enough gibe at Mr.
Pratten’s attempt to kill two birds with
one stone. The earmarking of a specific
sort of _ customs revenue for a specific sort
of public works, though it is growing popu-
lar in more lands than one, is likely to
cause a great deal of trouble for those who
practise it. If the revenue from motor
imports goes to make roads because motors
run on roads, then the revenue from whisky
might reasonably be devoted to sanatoria
for dipsomaniacs, since dipsomaniacs often
get that way through the use of whisky;
and the duty on candles might plausibly
be used to subsidise the equipment of
churches with stained-glass windows, since
some of the most popular churches are
pillars of the candle industry. Roads, how-
ever, aren’t primarily needed because there
are motor-cars, but because there are people
and they, live in a civilised state, connoting
the provision of adequate means of trans-
port and communication. It ought to be
sufficient to say that we run a Customs
House because we need the money and
want to protect our own industries without
going on to manufacture other reasons not
so easily defended. Anyway, as every old
politician knows, to earmark funds is to
multiply causes of friction.

The Dope Curse.
The first definite move in the war against
the growing dope-evil in Australia lias been
made in N. S. Wales, where there has been
created a bureau whose function will be to
collect all available information concerning
the drug traffic, compile lists of known
addicts and seek out the slimy degenerates
who carry on the business of selling nar-
cotics. Attached to the bureau are a couple
of detectives and a medical man with experi-
ence of narcotic-addiction; and the policy to
be followed is a sympathetic attitude towards
addicts and a relentless war on traffickers
While this bureau will he better than no-
thing, it is difficult to see what it can effect
in. the piesent state of the law, apart from
a more or less academic survey of the matter
As things stand, it is almost impossible for
the police to secure the conviction of a dru«-
trafficker unless they have the good fortune
fit 1 ;, him in the very act of making an
illicit sale, which seldom if ever happens.
And even should they be able to bring about
his conviction, the utmost penalty the law
can nifhet is a trifling fine of altogether
nejigible value as a deterrent to others of
rhe breed. On a close study of the situation
r, ° f the , W 01 ’ ld - seems not un-
likely that during the next few years Aus-
traha will experience a flood of drugs mucli

Nature Will Out.
Mentone : Jazz is doing more for us than
\\o generally credit; it with. The cave man
is not dead but sleeping beneath the veneer
oi a rather mechanical civilisation. The
iron hie is that civilisation’s inhibitions give
him no tree play; lie is cribbed, cabined and
confined by the spirit of the age. There is
a healthy strain of the primitive in modern
man. as Vy alt Whitman realised when he
sang in his barbaric yawp: “One hour to
madness and joy, O furious, O confine me
not The negro has a born love of melody .
and, being nearer the great heart of nature
than civilised man, he has evolved a melody
that is instinct with primitive emotion. This
appeals to the cave man of a civilisation
’ .'in seed, whose nerves are jangled and
thrown out of tune by the uncouth noses
ot modern machinery and the rush and roar
ot city life. It is an instinctive step back
to nature, this jazz craze, and has its uses.
I n til comparatively modern days, there was
a great festival kept by the more primitive
ioik of Bn rope—May Day. It was a day
and night of pagan rejoicing, in which love-
making, license and procreation ran riot.
Ihese festivals were tabooed by the Puritans

not succeed in doing these things, the white

Labor’s Mean Street.
The hide-bound political Laborite is always
laying the worker’s future out for him as
if lie was a child, and doing it, as a rule,
wry badly. The path of life is to be an
interminable Mean Street, lined on both
sides with small drab houses all exactly
alike. Down this the procession of toilers,
looking as much alike as possible, is to move
at an even pace, with boss political Labor-
ltes keeping an eye on the passing host lest
Private Drudge should have the effrontery
to put on a spurt, and get out of step. On
this basis N. S. Wales Acting-Premier
I.ougiiltn lately announced a reduction in
the pay of the better-class workmen in one
branch of the Public Works Department.
For doing more toil than is regarded as
the average they have been receiving rather
more pay than the average—been getting a
bonus, in fact. This is to cease because it
interrupts the monotony of the procession
of drilled and regimented folk along the Mean
Street of existence. Two things are abhor-
rent to the brand of Laborite in authority.
One is that any member of the common herd
should do better work than the average and
be paid for it. The other is that he should
do better work whether he is paid for it or
not lest he should thereby raise the average.
Energy suggests that he is ambitious, and
dissatisfied with the station whereunto it
has nleased Providence to call him; and the
Coughlin type is as solid on the necessity
ol keeping order among the people down be-
low as any member of the Dedlock or Bar-
nacle or Stiltstalking tribe.
O
Deputy Labor-leader Scullin told some
valuable half-truths (the small half) when
lie attacked Treasurer Page in the Reps,
over the Federal finances. Some of the
things lie said :
That taxation was increasing, not per head but
in the gross, despite the excellent seasons.
That in four years imports had exceeded exports bv
£32,000,000, and the country had to incur
£60,000,000 Of new foreign debt to pay for all
this buying of things which it couldn't afford, and
to cover the interest bill which should have been
paid for with exports.
That some of the “public works” charged up to
Federal loans were not works at all.
That reduction of debt out of surpluses was a
sham, for the gold debt, which is utterly ruinous
and disastrous, grows faster than the paper debt,
which doesn’t matter very much, is reduced.
But one of the things Scullin didn’t say
D that his Labor friends in Queensland and
X. S. Y\ ales are excusing their incredible
ENOUGH TO ANNOY ANY GALLANT GENTLEMAN.
“It’s a rotten service—always overcrowded !"
“Oh, what you growlin' for, Dad —you gotta scat!”
“Yeh, but your poor mother had to stand, didn't, she?"
deficits (they haven’t even a paper surplus
as Page has) on the ground that the seasons
are dreadful; so somebody must be lying.
Also lie didn’t mention that the country can’t
pay its way without more foreign loans un-
less it produces more; in other words, Scul-
lin's followers must w r ork at least 48 hours
a week, do good work and indulge in less
liquor, strike, horse and holiday time. (The
alternative is to reduce imports, hut that
also implies doing more work, and producing
goods to replace the imports.) Further,
Soulltn didn’t mention that the State loan
schedules are much more densely packed with
dishonest items than the Federal ones. Or
that dishonest items are inevitable now, for
no one can borrow enough under a show of
real public works to raise the money to meet
foreign liabilities, and that gets round again
to the insufficiency of production. It was,
i» short, a ease of Scullin reproving sin,
and doing it in a shabby way.

“Sol. M.” : I would like to suggest, with pro-
found and premeditated irreverence, that the
“Institute of Pacific Relations,” founded by
well-meaning obscurities at Honolulu, is a
dud, and originated from the fertile brain of
Mrs. Jellyby. If the delegation from even
the smallest and mildest community repre-
sented has a feasible plan for making an
end of war in its own territory—the war
between the criminal class and society is
a good thins 1 to stem with —it should do the
deed as a sample. The people who meet
to prevent war are the people who don’t need
preventing, for thev wouldn’t go to war in
any case. Those with an inclination for war
don’t attend excent possibly in jest. Two
causes of strife among many are that
crowded communities want to take empty or
partially empty territories, and that colored
individuals, especially large black males,
obiect to be told that they are untit to ttiate
with white women. If the Institute can
indicate a compromise satisfactory to both
parties it will make a good beginning. Pos-
sibly the best way to commence would do
by killing the Devil. The brute is no use
to me.
Ex-Centralian” ; With regard to Queens-
land s drought losses, it must not be for-
gotten that the jealousies of Brisbane, Rock-
hampton and Townsville (the two latter in
particular) with regard to western trade
have been a most potent factor in preventing
efficacious railway extension. A lot of the
Central District wool traffic, had the Winton-
Longreach connection been made, would have
gone to Townsville, and Rockhampton has
always been out to prevent this. It is true
William Kidston outlined a beautiful link-
ing-up scheme which would have cost enor-
mous sums, but he was very careful not to
offend his own Rockhampton friends by link-
ing up YY in ton and Longreach—a compara-
tively small matter that would by now have
saved its own cost over and over again. At
present the connection, it is true, is going-
on. but at such a rate that it looks like a
joke to the half-ruined sheepmen in the
stricken area. Naturally, for Railway-Min-
ister Larcomhe represents Rockhampton,
just as Kidsston did, and he also is not going
to embroil himself with his own constitu-
ency’s commercial interests.

Inspired thereto, no doubt, by the. em-
bittered Hun, the League of Nations has been
making inquiries, in view of the draft.
Slavery convention, as to the existence of
slavery in the ex-German territory man-
dated to Australia. Something has pro-
bably been heard of the “forced labor” which
Federal Labor politicians once regarded with
such dislike. The polite Bruce lias pointed
out that a certain amount of work is com-
pulsory for natives, but only on Government
account or their own, such as road-making
from village to village, cocoanut planting and
crop-sowing. Though nobody talks of slavery
in Papua, that Possession goes further, and
enjoins the carrying, by stages, of Govern-
ment stores or baggage. In practice these
things are always paid for, and the mandated
native is on a good wicket compared with
his Australian white brother when it comes
to forced service. For instance, he hasn’t to
toil to a polling-booth to vote, or be fined £2.

Innisfailure : In the early days, when
cattlemen or prospectors were murdered, it
was the custom for the Government to send
out a punitive expedition to chastise the
blacks. This custom has died out during the
last 30 or 40 years for want of raw material
to operate upon. Still Governments do their
best, and an expedition of exactly the same
kidney arrived at South Johnstone (Q.) the
other day. It wasn't blacks this time, hut cane-
coekies, who were to be taught a lesson. Last
season the South Johnstone mill crushed
200,000 tons of an average density of 12.5
c.c.s; but, though the caue was good, the
mill made a loss of £40,000, owing prin-
cipally to the 44-hour week and mismanage-
ment. The other day general-manager Short,
of Central Mills, was sent along to
tell the cockies that it was the intention of
the Government to levy 4s. a ton on this
season’s crop to meet the deficiency. That
was a bit of a shock; but the real one was to
come. Apparently seeing the commotion ho
had caused, the general manager went on to
explain things: “You have yourselves to
blame for this. You criticised the Govern-
ment during the elections /”

“Finn” : For 20 years we have heard the
complaint voiced by “Country Fed.” (B.
l/7/’2O) that Victorian boys are not getting
a manly education because the schools are
largely staffed with women. But little has
been done to make the teaching service attrac-
tive to young men. The chief reason why so
many male teachers resign after a short
trial is neither inadequate pay nor poor pros-
pects of promotion, but the lack of encourage-
nient_ given them in their early years of
training. ' Many head teachers do not want
male juniors in their schools. Boys are not
so biddable as girls, and are more prone to
evade irksome regulations. They cannot at
once be put in charge of a class, as most
girls can. Their first year must be spent
with the infants. Now, a boy of 16 is an
awkward, self-conscious creature, who feels
hopelessly out of place with little boys and
girls, and who hates to be under the direc-
tion of the Infant Mum. In a few city
schools the sexes are separated at the age
of eight or nine ; otherwise co-education is the
rule throughout all Vie. State schools. The
boy teacher is not a success with little
girls • he has too strict a sense of justice,
and fond parents storm the office with com-
plaints. But. why shouldn’t the boy teacher
teach boys from the outset? No, I am not
a disgruntled young male; I am a woman
who has trained boy teachers and for weary
years taught boys fresh from the hands
of dear, sweet, sympathetic Infant Mums.

An interesting case of morals—some people
call it ethics—has been before the County
( ’ourt in Melbourne. Plaintiff, an employee
of the Tramways Board, claimed 18s. 7d.,
being the difference between the wages paid
to him and the wages he alleged to be due to
him under a Commonwealth award. The
tacts went to show that, making a cover of
the strict interpretation of regulations, the
tramway employees, of whom the plaintiff
was one. had done their duty in what was
described as a “slow, sluggish and tedious
way ’ which impeded the, proper working of
the tramway organisation, and threw its run-
ning table into confusion. It also involved the
working of overtime. To enforce payment of
such overtime the plaintiff came to court.
Judge Winneke held that, “where men in
relation to their employment combined to
bring about results detrimental to their em-
ployers’ interests by means which amounted
to a breach of the obligations attaching to
ihe relationship of employer and employee,
with the result that additional time was
spent in their employers’ service, not fine of
those men was entitled to be paid wages for
the time so occupied”; and accordingly he
gave judgment for the defendant board with
costs. This finding raises the further ques-
tion whether a less than full complement of
work on a normal working day should be
paid for at full award rates. That too may
have to be tested some day.

“T.L. ’: There is great activity in building
at Canberra to provide civil servants with
accommodation. About 50 cottages are
almost ready for occupation at Blandfordia,
or Red Hill, as it is known locally. These
cottages are for the higher-paid officials, and
contain all modern conveniences and some
luxuries. Wardrobes and cupboards are
(milt in ; the kitchens are tiled and the floors
stained; and a sideboard is built into the
dining-room. Contracts have been let for
800 more cottages, all to be finished in
March next. Few of these will be as
well equipped as those at. Red Hill; but they
look like being comfortable and the rentals
will be moderate. Naturally, the men who
are on the construction jobs have to put
up with a good deal of discomfort: but for-
tunately at Molonglo settlement, two miles
inside the Territory from the Queanbeyan
boundary, there is an old German detention
camp, and most of the original buildings are
still available. The single men have a big
mess-hut and recreation-room, and live in
cubicles in the old detention barracks. On
the other side of the hill the barracks have
been turned into married quarters or tene-
ments. They are really long weatherboard
sheds, and each shed is partitioned off inside
into small rooms—the partitions don’t quite
reach the roof, by the way. Four rooms are
allotted to each family. The accommodation
is quite inadequate, and threatens to involve
pinch discomfort in the summer; but it is
infinitely superior to what the builders of
most new “rush” towns in the wilderness
have been able to command.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
General Cliauvel ljas reminded the Com-
monwealth Government that the British
Navy is being reduced to a one-Power stand-
ard, and might therefore find it “impossible
to operate effectively in the Pacific for some
time after the outbreak of war.” Also, that
a mere £1,563,000 was appropriated for
“military preparation” last year, although in
1913-14, when the purchasing power of the
pound sterling was much higher, £2,356,000
was spent. But the Government is so keen
on finding £20,000,000 for State roads and
another £20,000,000 for State housing that
Charnel's report will have to stand over.
There are no votes in “military preparation.”
A 10 p.c. reduction in general cargo rates
was announced last week by the British ship-
ping companies. They can’t be slugged to
any extent by the Langs and Badlys. A few
days later the N.S.W. shipping cos. raised
their cargo rates 10 p.c. Mr. Badly’s Work-
ers’ Compensation Act lias cost them £70,000
p.a. Before the Badly Blight settled on
industry Lang grandiloquently promised the
N.S.W. manufacturers a Government pre-
ference of “20 per cent, over British goods.”
With increased railway rates in sight as a
result of the Government’s gorgeous deficit,
the preference would now be over-valued at
tuppence.
An abortive motion (abortive because it
fizzled out on the time-limit) took place in
the House of Reps, re liquor at Canberra.
Three propositions are (1) that the Federal
Territory shall be dry, save for surreptitious
sale by bootleggers (and perhaps stocking-
hggers) ; (2) that only the Parliamentary
bar shall be wet; and (3) that the whole
place shall be wet. Meanwhile the workmen
are paid half one week and half the other,
so that the whole crowd may not get drunk
simultaneously; and at Queanbeyan, some
five miles away, they stand round the bars
six deep—some authorities say 60, but that
is an exaggeration. The annexation of
Queanbeyan and parts beyond seems essen-
tial to any anti-drink policy.
The idea that the big city is the best place
for manufactures has been punctured ten
thousand times' in the U.S.A., where the
enterprising man who wants to make things
nearly always picks out a small, handy town
to start in. The same rule would apply in
Australia if the railways weren’t run in the
interests of the big bloated city. Holdens,
of Adelaide, have just landed an order run-
ning into three-quarters of a million to build
bodies for Hudson and Essex cars; the little
city can do it in competition with Sydney
and Melbourne, notwithstanding that all its
coal has to be dragged from N. S. Wales.
The fact: is that in the small town the work-
man sees better the connection between his
job and bis living. In the big city, if one
job fails isn’t there another to turn to?
Watt’s candidly-friendly attitude to the
Bruce-Pages has been the most piquant cir-
cumstance of the Federal session. It was
first revealed on the Constitutional Altera-
tion Bills. At one point Attorney-General
Latham interjected that he couldn't follow
the lion, member, who must have mixed up
the notes of the speeches he intended to
make on the referendum proposals and the
Judiciary Bills. To which the ex-Speaker
tartly rejoined that, while the Priminister
had been more courteous than convincing,
the Attorney-General had managed to be
neither. The ex-S]Jteaker next tackled Page’s
Budget, but on this subject, as on the other,
he made no constructive suggestion. And
the part of candid friend whose criticism is
merely destructive is unworthy of Watt's
talents and reputation.
A second warning (the first was from Tas-
mania) :
The South Aus. Minister of Lands, at the conclusion
of a south-eastern trip, said that if the values of
wheat and wool were to recede to the point at
which they stood 10 or 12 years ago, the State
would be in a serious position, and might not be
able to meet its responsibilities and liabilities.
It certainly wouldn’t, simply because Aus-
tralia has grabbed the years of highest prices
to borrow hardest. The consequence is that
it is getting only a mile of railway for what
used to buy 2\ miles; and the man who, on
the strength of a rise, acquires 2\ wives in-
stead of the old one and only, finds things
horribly crowded if his income is cut down
to the old figure—especially if the new
never had the beginnings of an idea about
cooking a chop.
Westralian Laborites are going on with
their selection-bal-
lots, assured appa-
rently that the .Col-
lier Government
hasn’t the remotest
intention of alter-
ing the humorous
electoral arrange-
ment under which
one M.L.A. in the
subbubs represents
more people than
15 on the gold-
fields. A desperate
struggle in Mount
Margaret resulted
in the nomination
of Mick Hartigan,
who got 36 votes.
If Mick can poll
36 votes on elec-
tion-day he will
very likely win,
although the de-
cay o d camp is
alleged to contain
470 qualified
adults. There are
14.051 in Canning.

be the cause, and

Labor-leader Hogan’s no-confidence amend-
ment upon the Address-in-Reply was negatived
in Vic. Assembly by 33 votes to 39. Dun-
stan, who has cut adrift from the Farmers’
Union party and become a boss of the rival
P.P.U., voted with Hogan. Everard, who
was annoyed because the Government. hadn’t
vetoed a sanitary depot in his constituency
and hadn’t spanked the Fruit Advisory Board
at his bidding, kept outside while the divi-
sion was on. Billson, Chairman of Committees,
was too ill to jiut in an appearance, and there
were no pairs. McPherson and Greenwood,
acrid critics of the Ministry during the silly
season, voted for it, McPherson apologising
for baling described Allan’s leadership as
a joke. The fact is that the majority played
for safety, and that Labor was immensely
relieved when it: found itself in the minority.
As the House has 11 months to run, and as
the municipal elections are due in August
and the Federal referenda on September 4,
a State poll in the near future is unwelcome.
Ex-Premier Lawson said the other day at
Geelong that there might be an election for
Vic. Assembly at any time now, but explained
subsequently that he was flogging the obvi-
ous, as the Assembly was in its third year.
The average life of a Vic. Assembly is 2-|
years, and the existing one (the 28tli) is 25
months old. If any sort of a re-division of
seats bill could be passed this. session, it
would take a few months to re-arrange rolls
and other details, and that would mean a
campaign in March next year, which is
as near as one can get to it at present.
Barwell lost the last S. Aus. election prin-
cipally because he sent abroad for railway
engines and freight ears instead of letting
contracts in his own country. His offence
was rank, but not so rank as that of the
Queensland Labor Caucus, which, notwith-
standing that it joined in the hue and cry
against Barwell, has placed a £250,000 loco-
motive order overseas. The locomotives are
being bought, and the customs duty—4o p.c.
—will be paid with money borrowed in Bri-
tain. The Commonwealth Government will
collect £lOO,OOO of this borrowed money and
call it “revenue.” If the per capita pay-
ments are continued, portion of the bor-
rowed £lOO,OOO will be returned to the
Queensland Government, which will likewise
call it “revenue.” And some of the “revenue”

may go in rations for Australian locomotive-
builders, unemployed because of this mad
importing and equally mad finance.
Somebody has been appointed to investi-
gate “specific charges'’ against the N.S.W.
Railway Commissioners of buying imported
goods when locally-made ones were available
at lower prices. But no one has yet been
appointed to investigate the specific confes-
sion of Sydney’s Labor aldermen that they
intend to pay £ll2 10s. more for Italian cars
and £2S2 10s. more for United States cars
than the price at which British ones are
available, coupled with the statement of one
alderman that lie has a friend in the trade
and has a right to look after his friend’s
interest.
Mark Gosling, N. S. Wales M.L.A. (a
gosling being a minor goose), has given Ins
assurance that the burden of the new W ork-
men’s Compensation will make no difference
to industry because the addition of 17s. per
week to the male basic wage in October,
1919, did no harm that he noticed. But led-
eral awards and trades unionism or something-
sent wages up at much the same pace else-
where ; in fact, during 1921 the average rate
of all the States went up faster than that
of N.S.W. If the intensive Gosling is
assured that other States will take up the
insurance burden as they did the wage
burden, then there is only foreign competi-
tion to worry about.
In the year 1925-26 the receipts of
the Queensland Government increased by
£702,460, while expenditure rose by
£1,274,116. The actual increase, however,
was much greater, for in 1924-25 there was
a vote of £350,000 towards reduction of accu-
mulated deficits, while last year there was
no such item. There was, therefore, a growth
of £1.624.116 in expenditure as against only
£702,460 increase in revenue. The follow-
ing comparison sweeps in all figures:— i
Total State Expenditure.
Consol.
Revenue. Trust. Loans. Total.
1915. £7,199,399 £1,523,224 £2,638,266 £11,360,889
1926. . 16,154,404 7,290,656 4,950,847 28,395,907
In other words the present Government in
11 years of office has multiplied expenditure
by two and a half. And the thing still goes
merrily on.
The material for the extension of the
Darwin-Katlierine River railway another
stage was held up by strikers at Darwin at
the first time of asking, and as long as con-
signments keep arriving the same trouble
is liable to happen. It only shows the
dashed foolishness of humping heavy goods
half round a continent to a port where wages
are high and trouble chronic, just for the
sake of pig-headedly starting a job at the
wrong end. Working north from Ivingoonya
or Oodnadatta the Bruce-Pages would have
their own railway to bring up material and
wouldn’t meet so many Bolsheviks.
Fifteen years ago a board comprising
Jack Morrissey, Prof. Gilruth and G. G.
McColl recommended the Murray (Vic.)
Government to establish new stock saleyards,
with abattoirs and noxious-trade concomi-
tants, within 10 miles of Melbourne —north
or west. Another board —W. Davidson, .7.
M. Reed and Ballard —was asked to say
whether 2000 acres in the Werribee closer-
settlement estate, acquired in Bent’s time,
would be suitable for the three purposes. Its
reply was “Yes,” and it showed how the
project could be carried out. In accordance
with the best traditions, the reports were
put in tne store-room, and dust gathered on
them during the war. Now the Town Plan-
ning Commission has recommended a site a
mile north of the 2000 acres the State already
owns, and Premier Allan has his eye on 6uoo
acres at Tullamarine, and small buyers want
the stockyards just where they are at New-
market, and will shout with the crowd whose
demands mean most delay. And so the game
goes on with weak or weary Governments.
Bishop Dwyer, of Wagga, is the latest poten-
tate to register disapproval of the N.S.W.
Workers’ Compensation Act. In it he sees
a death-blow to the friendly societies, which
have played a leading part in the economic
and social life of a big section of the com-
munity. The Bishop is most concerned witli
the financial aspect; he sees that under the
Act the benefits will be paid for by someone
else, while the member of the friendly society
has to find his own fees. But employees will
soon find out that many of the ills to which
flesh is heir are not covered by the new law:
and wives and children who are not any-
body’s employees have a way of needing the
doctor too. So the man who thinks Lang’s
freak law can take the place of the lodge
had better think again.
The Queensland drought is being put to
the usual bad use by political mendicants.
Thus Sydney Telegraph (16/7/’26) :
The plight in which Queensland finds herself to-
day emphasises'once again the need for the con-
struction of a North-South railway from Darwin to
Bourke. ... Opinions may differ, and do differ very
seriously, regarding the construction of the direct
North-South railway from Darwin to Port Augusta,
hut all who have given the matter any thought
are agreed upon the necessity for the construction
of this line.
There is no difference of opinion among men
of honor who know the circumstances about
the obligation to build the Darwin-Port
Augusta railway; it has been paid for in
advance with the biggest land grant on
record. But perhaps men of honor arc
scarce. Chambers’s “Encyclopaedia” says Aus-
tralian daily journalism “has rarely been of
a high class,” and adds that these papers
“are cramped by the political leanings of
their advertisers.” Incidentally, there cer-
tainly is no agreement about the necessity
to build, at all-Australia’s charge, a line for
the express purpose of carrying sheep during
drought time, say once in seven years when
the owners would want cheap conveyance on
account of their poverty.
BALLADE OF THE GOOD SON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A witness before the Federal Electoral Com-
mission in Melbourne deposed to having seen a son
hail his father outside a polling-booth with ‘1 didn’t
think you would be able to get along, Dad, so I
voted for you.’ ”
Never forget, when your dad grows grey,
Shaky and crotchety, too, mayhap—
When life for von is like high noon-day
And he’s where the twilight shades enwrap—
Never forget, there’s a filial chap,

For his sake, I know, to the death you’d scrap.
And perhaps you can vote for the old man, too.
Age leans on youth as its staff and stay.
Humor his fads and bear with his yap.
He toiled for you like a father, eh,
Since the days you clambered into his lap?
So see that he doesn’t do a tap
More than he need now his years are few.
You can mow- the lawn, you can mend the gap

The table gives the history of the co. since
the public became interested. It makes
pleasant reading: regular 10 p.c. divs. and
additions to .visible reserves totalling
£194,203, of which £50,000 was passed out
as a one-in-five gift issue in 1920. The mar-
ket notes the achievement, counts the seven
years back to the bonus distribution, decides
that the time is nearly ripe, and vainly
seeks sellers of the £1 ordinaries at 345. 9d.
A further 100,000 ords. went on to the div.-
roll as from the beginning of the term, but
profits moved up comfortably arid there was
£16,373 to add to reserves after final appro-
priations. Visible accumulations amount to
£226,127, and this Column has a susnicion
that some of the assets hereunder are written
down well below their true value: —

Stocks, for instance, have been valued “at
replacement cost or less and provision has
been made for any decline in market values.”
Nevertheless the £186,166, although £32,486
heavier than in 1925, is still £90,000 lighter
than in 1921 despite an increased turnover,
which normally might be expected to result
m heavier holdings. As against that, of
course, values in 1921 were knocking at the
roof. Paper prices were almost stationary
last term, a slight fall in newsprint being
the only move worth mentioning. General
opinion is that the market will hold at or
near present levels. The freeholds are in
at well under their value, and, when the
directors report that provision has been
made for any fall in the value of invest-
ments. it may be taken that the item isn’t
overstated. Indeed, some of the nest-egg
consists of stocks which have had a very nice
rise since purchase. The cash holding at
April 30 was £12,904; at the previous bal-
)*“ceit was £70,181, but the new issue of
100,000 ords. had been paid for just prior
to the close of the 1925 accounts. Most of
this money went in increasing old advances
to customers or in new advances. This
policy has steadily been followed by the co.,
but “the whole of that asset is adequately
protected by reserves against any possible
loss." That is quite definite.
Current trading, liabilities at April 30
amounted to £141,435, against which were
cash, stocks. Government Loans and shares

111 1925 it was necessary to dig into reserves
for nearly £2OOO to make up 10 p.c., and
the Wild Cat foresaw a reduction in the
rate unless conditions changed for the better.
Instead of improving, the position in the
timber trade has become definitely worse.
A couple of firms whose principal line is
Australian (hoop) pine have not been dis-
turbed much, but almost all others have been
hit. Continued heavy importations of
Oregon have seriously affected the volume of
business in local timbers, particularly hard-
woods —Taylor's business is chiefly in heavy
timbers —and the keen competition has re-
duced profits where it has not made business
actually unpayable. Most milling and milling-
distributing cos. which issue balance-sheets
have disclosed losses for last year.
Of the cos. operating mainly in N. S.
Wales Taylor’s is the best situated. Its
connection with coastal shipping is worth a
lot: its concentration on big timbers obvi-
ates the necessity of carrying heavy stocks
subject to depreciation and the vagaries of
an import-ruled market; and it has had
some successes in its search for export mar-
kets. Also its salesmanship is so successful
that rivals are sometimes left wondering.
Nevertheless the lessening in the div. rate is
an indication that, with all its advantages,
its experience for the 12 months was not
happy. The outlook is by no means nromis-
ing either. Cries from many of the timber
centres that the new Workers’ Compensation
Act means ruin to their business are pro-
bably well-founded. Rut such a dire result
has been possible only because of the weak-
ening through continued heavy importations
of cheap softwoods. A further factor of im-
portance is the rapid extension of the uses for
concrete. At one time all ordinary bridge-
and culvert-work was carried out in hard-
wood ; to-day much of that class of work is
done in the new material. Steel and re-
inforced concrete have also displaced beams
and uprights in building. Altogether there
isn’t much that is bright in the picture.
Balance-sheet figures, however, continue
solid; though a pretty large lump of the
assets is in the doubtful entry “Country
mills, etc.” :

The decrease of £30',000 in liabilities is bal
anced by the movement in stocks and book
debts; the co.’s organisation is sucli that it
responds immediately to the market and
there is no over-accumulation in the produc-
ing centres. That is an advantage which
few dist. buting cos. have: it is an advan-
tage whi a proved of immense value when
prices slumped after the boom, and, more
recently, when most cos. were participants
in a price war. “Investments” of the table
consist of public securities, fixed deposits
and shares in public cos. amounting to
£43,000, which forms the reserve •fund. The
fact that such a solid sum is invested out-
side is comforting. In the past, portion of
the earnings from those investments was
credited direct to the fund (they were in-
cluded in profits of the introductory table),
but there was no movement last year nor
in 1925. That is more likely to be' a reflec-
tion of the hard times in the industry than
of the co.’s contentment with the size of
the accumulation. Assets are reported to
be in good condition, carefully valued and
adequately insured; and although the pro-
vision for depreciation is not stated, it may
be accepted that the management wasn’t
carried away with enthusiasm when it wrote
in the totals.
Nevertheless, although Taylor’s is better
situated than most, unless it can find a pay-
able outlet overseas—which is doubtful—
or unless local demand for heavy timber suf-
fers an unexpected improvement, even the
J P'C. div. does not look a certainty for
1927. Any serious reduction- in costs seems
past hoping for, and all efforts so far to get
better protection through the Customs has
failed, though there is a promise of a further
inquiry; wherefore a seller at 21s. 9d. is
heard on the market without any buyer de-
claring himself.

Here is progress- quite out of the ordinary.
How long it will continue is hard to say,
but it would seem that thus far the field lias
only been touched. Careful selection of risks
licis enabled tlie management to show very
bright results, and it is so satisfied with its
net returns and the prospects that it has
widened its already wide policy-benefits “by
including, free of any extra premium, the
risk of theft of parts, fittings or accessories
of cars, irrespective of whether the car itself
was stolen.” That is not likely to increase
its popularity in underwriting circles —the
co.. is outside the associated underwriters,
owing to its rate-cutting. Whether keen
surveillance will offset the additional risks
contained in the new benefits remains to be
seen. Of course, the fact that the co. is
looked upon as something in the nature of
an offshoot of the Vic. Auto. Club is worth
a lot. The idea behind its formation was
that it should handle the business of metn-
bers, and that members’ shares should be pur-
chased and pass into possession of the club,
which should be assisted as the Vic. Chamber
of Manufactures had been assisted by its
insurance venture. However, the co. soon
went beyond the club membership for busi-
ness, although the latter still is its chief
source. This lias been helpful in keeping
costs low. The directors declare that income
could have been considerably increased if the
scrutiny had been weakened or higher com-
missions paid. Neither are necessary yet;
nor should they be in the future, for the co.
has an ever-widening field which should be
workable on the lines at present followed.
It is obvious, also, that there can be no
slackening of any kind if the liberalised
benefits are. to be maintained. Australia
really doesn’t know very much yet about
automobile insurance; but if the American
experience is duplicated here the risks will
have a nasty habit of growing with the in-
crease of cars on the roads.
The perennial hunt for premises has
ended: a substantial block has been pur-
chased in Little Flinders-street. Portion for
the co.’s own use is undergoing extensive
alteration; “the whole of the remainder is
well let.” Increased business rendered the
present offices inadequate, the directors re-
cording this happy state of affairs: “Owing
to the outgrowth of our office accommoda-
tion, it was felt that it would be much more
satisfactory to ‘mark time’ and not actively
seek business owing to the lack of facilities
to give it proper attention and despatch.”
And. the balance-sheet is clear of intangibles.
During the year 9450 new shares were issued,
making a total of 24.100 ordinaries paid to
10s. There are, in addition, 5000 8 p.c. prefs.
paid to 10s. On April 30 £22,500 was owing
on the freehold, sundry creditors amounted
to 110,020 and outstanding claims £2173.
'l’he new building bulked large in the assets
at £32.500, with public securities, cash and
interest accrued totalling £26,810. Book
debts amounted to £11,446 and equipment,
etc., written down to £2865. The co. reports
the establishment of the British Medical
Insurance Co. of Victoria, conducted in
conjunction with the parent co., which is to
receive the benefit of the new concern’s re-
insurance.

That isn’t so bad : £7437 more of net profits :
an increase in the div. to ordinaries; and
35 p.c. of the year’s net income sent to
reserves. Here is the position as shown

In 1922 liabilities aggregated £289,511; last
year the total was £175,999, a decrease of
£93.512. From some viewpoints last year’s
figures were not as good as those of 1925,
especially as £6OOO of new capital was got in.
Still, the distribution of the debt might be con-
sidered slightly more favorable. The increase
was chiefly in trade creditors—£sl,496 com-
pared with £26 812 the previous year. Mort-
gages were £5600 compared with £13,144.
The floating debt at March 31 was sub-
stantial, but the liquid position was strong:
stocks, investments (unspecified), cash and
book debts amounted to £589,397.
Although the div. rate was lifted a point
it was not at the expense of the manage-
ment’s avowed policy of building up reserves,
the amount undistributed being greater than
that added in the boom year. Furthermore,
although gross profit was £157,407 com-
pared with £138,704, £15,753 was written
off depreciation (£l3 683 in 1925) ; £10,383
sundry losses (£2118) ; and general exes,
and provision for bad debts were £67,110
compared with £56,981 exes, and £5984 bad
debts written off in 1925. The directors had
hoped to do even bigger things last year. On
this occasion they strike a cautious note:
“Competition in the island trade is becom-
ing keener and profits more difficult to make,
but improved organisation and an easier
financial position should show results equal
to those of the term just ended.” It seems
a safe forecast, for island produce is holding
steady and the outlook seems good. Fiji
is experimenting with dairying and pine-
apple cultivation as additions to its staples
—sugar and copra—and Morris, Hedstrom's
is so much a part of Fiji (the co/s paid
capital is £719,613) that any success or any
new industry inevitably will bring some grist
to its mills. Meantime another 6 p.c. seems
likely, with prospects of something better if
results for the pr. sent term show improve-
ment.

Actually the improvement in earnings last
year was better than those figures suggest,
for £3500 was set aside out of the profits
for the Employees’ Provident Fund; the pre-
vious vote traceable was made four years
ago. Net profit claimed by the accounts was
£31,461 compared with £29,488 for 1925.
In both cases additions to a tax-free income
reserve were ignored ; last year the amount
involved was £11,658 —yvvhich suggests a tidy
holding of lion-taxable Government securi-
ties. Such stocks are included in “Federal
and State loans, shares in other cos., paid
deposits, advances, etc., less provision against
fluctuations, £321,498.” Such a large liquid
holding—paid capital is £182,731 —reads very
rich, but a glance at the co.’s outside lia-
bilities brings it into correct perspective :

The co.’s big turnover demands heavy stock
purchases, and advantage has been taken of
the low rates for money ruling in “the East”
to negotiate drafts at longer dates than
usual. Despite an increase of £lO,OOO in
sundry creditors, the financial position
showed greater strength, liquids at March 31
amounting to £563.986 compared with £518,436
a year ago, the liquid surplus increasing
£35,636 and reaching £200,744. At March 31
there was. £30,838 in the tax-free income
reserve, £51,989 in general and capital re-
serves and £7668 undistributed balance,
offset by goodwill items in at £45,000. Re-
serves for insurance, replacements, taxation
and contingencies—£63,o93—are not con-
sidered in calculating reserves of the intro-
ductory table. During the year £7351 was
added, and as the accumulation now amounts
to two-thirds of the fixed assets, most of
which is represented by the co.’s new pre-
mises, a part both of the total and of last
year’s addition is probably true profit,

I red Seifert Co., Ltd., of Maoriland, seeks
a capital of £lOO,OOO in £1 shares, of which
86,100 are offered to the public; 13,900 fully-
paids go to ,the vendor and promoter. The
object is to acquire the freehold of 4375
acres of flax-growing land, eight miles from
Morrinsville and 13 from Hamilton ; to plant
2000 acres and cultivate and cut it by the
latest methods and develop the balance out
of profits. The purchase price is £43,600,
of which £12.400 is to be paid in shares;
mortgages amounting to £3300 are to be
taken over; the balance (£27,900) is to be
paid in cash spread over three years. The
land appears to be well suited for flax-growing
and it is within reasonable rail distance of
Auckland. Fred Seifert is a practical hemp-
grower ; he is to be general manager for five
years. Of the 13,900 vendors’ shares, 12,400
go iti part payment for the property. Seifert
gets the balance (1500) plus £l5OO in cash
tor preliminary expenses. As estimates
are based on average market quotations for

period) some of the golden results which the
prospectus' visualises have a reasonable

Perhaps the greatest of the many advantages
Pioneer Wood Pipe offers as a conduit is its un-
failing capacity. At the outset it will carry from
15 to 20 p.c. more water, size for size, than any
other type of pipe, because of its smooth internal
bore, which offers the least possible resistance to the
flow; this superior capacity tends to increase with
service, for the pipe never corrodes, no tubercles
form to choke back the water, no foothold is afforded
to sediment or organic growths, the volume of flow
continues unchecked. Think of the years ahead and

This wire from Darwin gives an interest-
ing glimpse into the difficulties of pioneering
the Territory under existing conditions: —
Eugene Peter Zakharrow, field manager for the
Elcho Island Petroleum Company, returned to Darwin
yesterday (July 15) in the launch John Mcßride,
belonging to the Methodist Mission to the aborigines
at Goulburn Island. Elcho Island natives reported
to Zakharrow that the contract coastal-service steamer
Marion Sleigh had gone past the islands on her
initial trip to the Macarthur River, and that was
after the island had been six months without a
call. Zakharrow then asked the Mission to take
him and his wife into Darwin. He had been waiting
since April. The Mission boat came into Darwin
for stores and rations, but the fact that the Malabar
on her last trip carried Darwin cargo on to Singapore
had made foodstuffs practically unobtainable. Zak-
harrow is still optimistic regarding oil at Elcho
Island, but boring was abandoned at 284 ft. No
caretaker has been left on the island to look after
about £2600 worth of machinery, etc. He asserts
that, of the large amount of money invested by
shareholders, only about £4500 has been expended at
Elcho Island. He complains that his urgent requests
for essential tools and other requirements were con-
tinually unheeded, greatly to the detriment of boring.
Prior to leaving the island he had not received any
communication from Melbourne since October last.
He reports that provisions of all kinds are very
scarce right along the northern coast, including
Groote Eylandt, and the position of the few settlers
is critical. Zakharrow emphatically states that there
is enough bitumen on the Elcho Islands and adjacent
thereto to supply the needs of all Australia. He
has been engaged by a local syndicate as prospector
and surveyor for oil and coal.

Kennedy’s Freehold, added to the list of
tin-dredging cos. on Sydney Exchange, is
operating at Bullock Swamp, 10 miles from
Emmaville (N.S.W.). The co. is in the
Hilton stable, Joe Millican, the one-time
Charters Towers magnate, being chairman,
and the manager is Tom Waters, of the
Queen Cross in its palmy days and more
recently of the ill-fated Crown, near Mudgee.
The co. has a nominal capital of £13,000 in
26,000 10s. shares, of which 6500 are ven-
dors. There is also a 12J p.c. debenture of
£l5OO. In 1922 the co. was floated in 16,000
10s. shares to sluice a property in the Emma-
ville district, but has since been recon-
structed and switched over to the Bullock
Swamp dredging proposition, close by the
Tent Hill-Gulf road. A report by J. W.
Stoneham gives the area acquired as 75
acres, of which 35 acres averaging 10ft. deep
are valued at 31b. to the yd. over 564,000yd5.
Some holes gave 131 b. and others below 41b.
The lease comprises a creek and flats about
two miles in length, and is mostly virgin
country. The dredge now operating was
originally provided by W. E. Hills, of Kam-
pong, C. P. Tom and J. W. Stoneham, all
of whom are now dead. They put about
£7OOO into plant, and £6OOO won from the
ground also went back into it, but they
appear to have started at the wrong end,
and consequently struck 1-mile of blank
ground which anchored them. Waters is
recovering about 25cwt. oxide a month in the
process of clearing the dredge into the pro-
mised land ahead.

A sanguine report has been written by W.
H. Cundy about three small mines at Broken
Hill, now being amalgamated: the Great
Western, five miles w.-n.-w. of Broken Hill
and 34 miles from the Limestone siding on
the Silverton line; the Great Northern
Blocks, adjoining the North Broken Hill;
and the Centennial. The prospects of this
new venture depend mainly upon whether
the great Broken Hill lode continues north.
Cundy writes thus: “The old fallacy that the
main Broken Hill lode ended abruptly at
each end has been exploded, and there is
little doubt that the north extension will be
in active operation in a few years to come,
and producing high-grade lead, zinc and sil-
ver products.” Possibly, but the £17.500 cash
which the public is asked to provide is not
likely to be half enough to prove it.

Adeloug Gold Estates (N.S.W.) plant be-
haved so well during the half-year to April
30 that 333.548yd5. returned 29620 z., worth
£ll,BBl. Mining costs were £7Oll and office
exes, and income-tax £926, but the co. got a
lift by refund of £l7OB from the N. S. Wales
Income-tax Department, which, with £l2ll
brought forward, gave the directors £7040
to handle. After paying Is. div., £3229 re-
mained to carry forward, and another Is. has
been distributed since the closing of accounts.
The mine profit of £4870 was an improve-
ment on the previous half-year, because
£11054 for repairs and maintenance were in-
cluded in the current accounts. The dredge
treated 127yds. an hour, the return being
4.202gr5. per yard, worth 5.540 d. at a cost
of 5.045 d. The co. has a paid capital of
£88,125, and liquid assets (£14,208) include
deposits at call £10,102.
South Lucknow (N.S.W.), after a period
of inactivity, is seeking the aid of the Mines
Department to prove the joint with the
diamond drill. For three years time and
money have been spent on new shaft work
and handling positions which have proved
valueless. The suggested work is expected
to cost about £2OO0 —little compared with
the £15,000 thrown down the new shaft.
Lucknow Tups has been concentrating on the
joint drive. For the last 70ft. the course
of the joint has been southerly. When the
turn to the normal strike occurs the en-
thusiasts hope for the elusive “good develop-
ment.”
The new Westralian State Insurance Office,
having notified the Kalgoorlie Chamber of
Mine's that all miners must be insured with
the State against both accidents and miners'
complaints, has, it would seem, limited the
life of the Kalgoorlie field to the payable ore
reserves contained in the South Kalgurli
and Boulder Perseverance. There was a
chance that the Lake View and Star would
take over the closed-dowm Horseshoe with its
many liabilities. The new insurance pro-
posals, however, will probably settle the
idea of amalgamation. At present no con-
siderable quantity of pay ore is exposed in
any mine on the Golden Mile, excepting
South Ivalgurli and Perseverance, and the
insurance premiums payable under the
Miners’ Phthisis Act w T ill be a heavy load
even for the South Kalgurli and Persever-
ance. The effect may be to force the mines
into the hands of tributors.

A sign of the times. In 189 G Fraser’s,
Southern Cross (W.A.), was treating 2001)
tons of lOdwt. ore monthly and paying
sixpenny divs. per month on 50,000 shares.
In 3926 Great Boulder is treating 10,000
tons of similar-grade ore monthly at a loss.

With tin at £277 per ton, Greenbushes
(VV .A.) is hoping for a revival. A co. has
been formed to work the old Cornwall, and
pumping operations have commenced. Mine-
water is fyeavy, but shareholders should get
a run for their money.

If insurance premiums, do not prove too

“Peter”: Permission to perform mining
operations on the recreation ground in the
heart of the town of Southern Cross has
been given by the Yilgarn Iload Board in
whom the ground is vested. It would prob-
ably pay to remove what remains of the
“Cross” to the granite area on the east, thus
throwing the whole town area open to pros-
pectoi's. Gold-bearing ore has often been found
in the town’s back yards, but, owing to the
requirements of the Mining on Private Pro-
perty Act, such discoveries go no further.

Glenelg Hills, 60 miles south of Southern
Cross (W.A.), is attracting gold seekers and
their backei’s. Several parties are prospect-
ing a promising belt of new counti'y there
and are hopeful of success. Hollow and
Heaton’s Find, which was made a few years
ago, is in this locality. Several claims are
being worked, but until lately holders had
a rough spin owing to scarcity of water and
provisions. Government assistance has now
made their lot easier, and with good widths
and values in sight they are looking forward
to better times. The hope of a gold-mining
revival in the West lies not in Government
expenditure on dead or dying fields or lending
money to old-established, spendthrift cos.,
but in rendering assistance to prospectoi-s on
new fields or to locate and develop new
fields.

per ton over a width of ,I.oft. have been
obtained by R. C. Wilson, Assistant-State
Mining Engineer. Wilson says the field has
a chance.
The crushings from the Mauretania, Stan-
hills (N.Q.), are lying at grass, the Govern-
ment battery still being incomnlete. The
field, now being in its dry spell, will pro-
bably have to wait for a few good thunder-
storms in spring to enable crushings to go
ahead, and if these fail it may be the end of
the year before results are to hand. It was
hailed last year a.s a field likely to make its
mark provided local crushing f°cib'H«s were
obtainable. The weary wait for these has
disheartened prospectors excent a few of
the most determined who are hanging on
until the mill is in commission.
Sardine’s last crushing on Kangaroo Hills
(N.Q.) put £2440 in the till, as IG6 tons
yielded 15 tons of concentrates. About 80
tons are on hand towards the next clean-up,
and so far it looks as if it will bulk 10 to
12 p.c. The No. 4 south level, out in search
of new shouts, is 265 ft. from the engine shaft
in a clean formation but no ore. Faces in
stopes show anything up to 3ft. of good ore,
and there is no immediate apprehension of
a shortage of mill-feed good enough to keep
the present prospecting campaign afloat and
pay a couple of threepennies.

Dam-construction still fills the programme
at Ivawarau (M.L.). The site of Nos. 6
and 7, the last two piers, has been pumped
dry, and the concrete foundation of No. 6
completed. “The manager is confident that
the dam will be finished by the end of July.”
The Amalgamated Co. is meantime making
prospecting arrangements, and should get
down into the river-bed soon after the dam
gates are closed. August, on this schedule,
should see a boom or a stampede.

Rawang has had a pretty good spin,
revenue account for the 12 mouths to March
21 showing £37,672. But, though the power
plant and the 14in. sluicing plant toiled
throughout the year, necessary alterations to
the dredging plant made it impossible to do
good work in that section till the middle of
December. During the year capital was
converted from two million dollars (Straits)
to £240,000. Two interim dividends of a shil-
ling each were paid on the new sterling
shares, and a share bonus of $57,142.85
was declared in connection with the capital
increase. After writing off all expenditure,
including alterations to the bucket dredge,
profits were £83,867. Of that £10,973 has
gone to amortisation and depreciation
account, which now stands at £30,000. There
is thus left a credit of £7266 carried forward.
All this in spite of a bad season and the
scarcity of native labor, which is markedly
affecting Malayan operations. The co. now
holds 997 acres, and the recovery in March
was 1.191 b. Ore realisation worked out at
£166 2s. 2d. per ton (on a basis of £271 6s.
9d., London, three months) and production
costs were £B4 16s. 4d.

The Federated Malay States, the Cinder-
ella of the Empire, during 1925 imported
goods to the value of £15.996,866, and ex-
ported £48,043,337 of tin, rubber, etc.! The
trade balance of £32,046,471 was almost
enough to pay the interest on the British
debt to America. Very rightly the tax-
gatherer is busy. During 1925 he collected
£1.633.406 from Australian and other
dredgers, etc., as against £822,134 in 1914.
The Settlements dredge (F.M.S.) seems
to be getting into its stride, recovering 21
tons from 42,000yd5. treated during the first
half of July. This is the first dredge in the
Taiping district to be fitted with jigs, and
the success of this departure from old
methods will be closely watched by other cos.
Bundi (F.M.S.) continues to disappoint
owing partly to clayey ground, partly to the
old type of dredge. Its new machine is said
to be modelled on Alluvial Tin’s dredges,
including jigs and classifiers. Puddlers may
have to be used, too. f #
Huey Yot (F.M.S.) begins to look more
tangible than it used to. Its Werf Conrad
dredge from Haarlem is said to be likely
to begin digging during the first half of
1927, and the area lias been raised to 864
acres by acquisitions. Borings have con-
siderably enhanced the ground values since
the Trang period of the co.’s history, and
have gone beyond a pound in most places.
The wash, however, remains on the shallow-
side, 22 to 28 feet.

Malay-Siamese Prospecting Co., of which
A. J. King is chairman, has, besides Nawng
Pet and Huey Yot, the direction of Phin
Soon and a new venture called Haadyai.
From these two more than 100,000 paids will
accrue to the parent, whose shares have run
beyond 70s. The option thermometer is so
high that no less than nine new properties
have been given the once over, and “several
other options are in hand.” #
Despite low yields, Nawng Pet (F.M.S.)
has moved above 4s. A. J. King announces
that when the wet season comes in October
and November, the co. will be in a position
to treat an extra 20,000yds. monthly and
thus add 18 tons to its monthly output. A
hydro-electric plant is mentioned, as the
medium whereby improved yields will accrue.
The message will be welcome news to holders
who have found 1926 a lean year.

Siam Concessions floated Kopah, its 300-
acre block at Takuapa, Western Siam, pros-
pected at 9oz. to the yd.; average depth,
36ft. The capital of the pup is £llO,OOO,
of which 20,000 paids go to the parent,
12 500 ditto to the vendor and 70,000 con-
fabs. to the public. The five directors took
7500 cum. participating prefs., carrying 10
p.e., for which they paid cash, and also guar-
anteed subscription of the issue of 70,000
ordinaries. Besides 12,500 paids, the vendor
of the area lifted £12,500 in cash. The ori-
ginal option covered 2000 acres, of which
400 acres was said to be pound ground, but
the vendor asked the prohibitive price of
£lOO,OOO for the lot. All along the line ven-
dors’ demands are sky-rocketting in unison
with taxation, royalties and the price of
coolie labor.

“R.H.H.” on the most sensational mining
case of recent years:—
Joseph Myers, Maorilander by birth and Canadian
by adoption, after 15 months of trials and re trials
in Winnipeg courts on a charge of misrepresentation
with intent to deceive investors in the Bingo Gold
Mines, is at length a free man. The Judge dis-
missed the ease with the comment that no evidence
had been brought before the Court reflecting on
Myers’s character as an honest man. Late in 1921
the Bingo gold-mine, situated in Northern Manitoba,
Canada, of which Myers was managing director
and from which glowing reports had been issued from
time to time, was condemned by mining engineers.
Myers was arrested on charges of salting the
property. Myers is the biggest individual shareholder
in the eo. After the preliminary trial, London
shareholders supported him and replaced the directors
who had been responsible for instituting proceedings
against him. Canadian shareholders also voted their
confidence in him. That there is a nigger in the wood-
pile is obvious, and it seems equally certain that
Myers, who was in Maoriland and England when the
salting is alleged to have taken place, was the
innocent victim.

Ij. L. Wrathall, field superintendent of

site lias been selected on the Meta Hou con-

of oil and gas.” For some reason not given,
it will not be deepened.

HILDA : “Never mind, old bean — you’re holding your own at sit-

“Groper” : The hamlet of Wagin, on the
Southern line between Perth and Albany
(W.A.), was the scene of a picturesque
ceremony the other day when, on the death
of George Dinah, “king” of the territory from
Southern Cross to Albany, Beaufort Dinah,
his eldest son, was elevated to the throne.
Wagin’s black brother is a self-respecting
person who dresses his womenfolk in short
skirts and silk stockings. Sixteen of him
came to do the now-monarch homage, and
Wagin’s mayor performed the coronation in
the presence of 600 whites. Beaufort, when
called upon for a speech, said “Thanks
awf’lly.” It was what most kings would
say if they had to prepare their own ad-
dresses.
"Oboe” : At a meeting of Melbourne share-
holders of a mining co. a lot was said by
the directors about their optimism. They
were backed up by a rugged and whiskered
shareholder at the back. But another scrip-
holder had doubtful thoughts about it. He
got up and asked the directors: “You want
us to be optimistic —would you mind telling
us what an optimist is?” While they were
scratching their heads for a , fit answer
Whiskers stood up and did it for them. "111
tell yer! The difference between an optimist
and a pessimist is this: when they both look
at a little jug at the other end of a tea-table,
one says, ‘I s’pose there’s no milk in that
jug.’ That’s the pessimist. The optimist
says, ‘Please pass the cream.' ”

“Coot,”: In the Court of General Sessions
at Melbourne the other day, the jury had
retired to consider their verdict. It was a
raw morning, and after a couple of hours
they returned into court with a mild request
that they might have some dinner before fur-
ther arguing out the case. Judge Wasley, how-
ever, told them that no provision was made
for supplying meals to jurors except in capi-
tal charges, and once they retired to consider
their verdict they could not be separated. “In
any case,” he added, “it would take some time
to get a meal prepared, and the jurors would
have to pay for it.” Anybody hut the Law
could guess what would happen: the jury-
men retired disconsolately, and within five
minutes were back with a verdict of acquittal.
“20b” : I was on the old-time inter-Stater
Ivyarra when she was torpedoed in the Eng-
lish Channel during 1918—she was then an
auxiliary hospital transport conveying in-
valid Diggers back to Australia. It was
early morning, and we were just off a small
fishing village called Swanage when Fritz
caught us with a bolt amidships. Such life-
boats as were undamaged were launched, and
the ship sank in just nine minutes. Fortu-
nately there were only about .30 soldiers
aboard besides the vessel’s crew ; the nine
casualties were mostly among the ..engine-
room staff. The soldiers had fallen-in at the
place of assembly as steadily as if they
were on parade, but a small section of the
crew showed signs of panic and an inclina-
tion to rush the boats. At this critical
moment one of the Diggers yelled out, “Hey,
steady there —women and children first!”
The sarcasm, followed by a burst of laughter
from the Diggers, proved effective; the over-
eager ones shamefacedly drew back, and
the boats were filled without haste or inter-
ference. Even the ship's cat, perplexedly
walking along the deck-rail, was dumped by
someone into the last boat as it pushed off.

“Doggo”: Of all things Celestine’s bull-
dog most hated a Pomeranian pup addressed
by its girl-owner as “darling.” Opportunity
delivered the pup into the jaws of John Bull,
and the creature’s mistress stalked off to the
courts for damages. But. she failed to get
them. Concluding, wrongfully, that the
occupier of the house was the person who
ought to keep lions, serpents and other
offensive inmates under control so that they
would not bite visitors or visitors’ pups, she
brought her action against the householder:
but he washed his hands of the whole busi-
ness, saying “The bulldog is not mine, it is
the bulldog of my daughter, aged 17 and
capable of controlling him.” Some ill-bred
lawyers called this nonsense, and to settle
the matter they went to the Appeal Court.
That tribunal said “Why persecute this in-
nocent: householder? He wots not of the
dog. Apply yourself to the daughter.” And
the suffering ladv of the Pomeranian pup had
to pay heavy costs. That was* an English

case, but recently one on all-fours came be-
fore Judge Dethridge in the Vic. County
Court. Here a young lady sought damages
on account of a bite she had received from a
dog. She claimed them from the head of
the house wherein she had been injured. “Oh
no, you don’t,” was his defence;“that dog
belongs to my wife.” And bis counsel tri-
umphantly threw the English case at the (
Judge. "Well, all I can say, "remarked;
’sllonor, “is that it is against sense. If ,a
man allows another to keep tigers or rattle-
snakes on his premises and a third party
gets injured, is not the owner who allows
these things to be kept responsible?” Then
unfortunately the case went down on the
facts, and the conflict between the English
Appeal Court and the County Court of Vic-
toria was unavoidably postponed.
“Cleveland”: The North soon takes tlm
heart out of one. The other day a man of
those parts aged over 80 turned up at a
dentist's for a set of teeth. The dentist
usually gives a five-year guarantee and
offered it in this case; but the prospective
patient insisted on a 10-year guarantee ’ and
wouldn’t take the chair till he got it.
"Black Magpie”: I knew two dear, old
sisters who kept house together. One had
a fine double set of false teeth; the other
had no teeth at all. artificial or otherwise.
Contrary to what one might expect, the
possessor of the teeth died first. In a
special codicil to her will she bequeathed
them to her sister, who joyfully took
possession of them after the funeral and
was both astonished and indignant when she
found they didn't fit.
“T. 0.1.”: I know a lady missioner who
conducts meetings on Sundays in the Water-
loo (Sydney) park. On her last appearance,
while she was tentatively surveying the vine-
yard, a lad volunteered to show her “a bonzer
place to get a crowd.” She followed him in
all good faith, and presently found herself
beside a two-up school in full blast.
* * * *
“Clerk”: Dragged up on an after-hours
trading charge at the Carlton (Vic.) Court
the other day, Bung asserted that the booze
which he was said to have sold was really
horse-physic. A neighbor gave evidence in
support of the defence, and explained that he
always kept a few bottles of beer in. his
stable “in case his horses got sick.” If a
horse was indisposed, he boiled half a bottle
of beer, added a couple of spoonsful of ginger
and let the afflicted animal drink the mix-
ture. The Beak, unmoVed. by the ingenious
story, made it a tenner. No wonder they
are writing to the Red Page to say that this
country doesn’t know how to appreciate
good stories.
“Centurion” : They can't be satisfied even
with the old ways of murder nowadays. In
Essex (Eng.) a young female has been
found in a ditch
with most of her
head dispersed by
a “humane killer.”
This is a contri-
vance used.f or
slaying the larger
animals, and is in
vogue with vets.,
as racec'o ur se
habitues may have
noted. It is made
to lit on the fore-
head of a horse or
other beast, when
a trigger either ex-
plodes a cartridge
or releases a spring
whi c h drives a
spike into the
brain. The former-
type was, appa-
rently, used in the
case under notice,
though h o w the
patient came to
permit the adjust-
ment of the rather
fearsome appara-
tus to her os fron-
tis is a mystery.
It is just possible
that the slayer fol-
lowed the methods
employed in a
Prussian case,
where a damsel,
induced her dentist
lover to sit in his
own chair and play
at being patient,
while she aped the
dentist. When he
opened his rtiouth*
she put a revolver
muzzle between 'liis
teeth and pulled
the trigger. Her
explanation was
that she had lost
her head over, an-
other man. The
Courts saw to it
that she lost it again over the dentist. They
use the sword instead of the rope in Prussia.

“J.A.W.”: The Mayor of our hamlet, who
has always enjoyed a melancholy celebrity
for what London Punch ' used to term
“Things That Might. Have Been Expressed
Otherwise,” outdid himself the other evening
when he hopped on the platform to announce
the results of the children’s elocutionary
competitions. The hall was packed, the
ladies being in considerable force, and his
Worship, exuding amiability, began; “I see
quite a number of expectant mothers here
to-night.” The giggles, titters and blushes
which greeted this gambit incited him to
continue jocularly: "Yes, you may smile.

“Lemons’ Pal, Casey’s Corner. Is there no help
or the widow’s daughter?” — S. M. Herald agony ad.
“Lemons’ Pal.”
Seems a bit problematical.
“Casey’s Corner”—l remember a few
Where swing-doors open to let you through
Up at Balmain or down in the ’Loo.
But whomsoever the message is to,
And whatever it is that he hasn’t bought her,
“Is there no help for the widow’s daughter?”
“Lemons’ Pal” sounds whimsical.
Hardly the sort of phrase a gal
Would use for endearment cordial.
Was she left forlofner
On “Casey’s Corner”
Than poor CEnone, that wandering mourner
On Ida’s slopes when no Paris sought her ?
And where’s the key
To the mystery—
“ls there no help for the widow’s daughter?”
“Lemons’ Pal!”
Might be some underworld cabal
Sending a message in cunning code
To learn—or tell —-where the loot is stoweo.
Pointer, perhaps, or maybe a Warner
For the riddle-reader in “Casey’s Corner.”
Will some brow grow tenser, some fist clench tauter,
Will it bring relief or turn thoughts to slaughter?
“Is there no help for the widow’s daughter?”
“Lemons’ Pal!” Some trivial
Jest or a message, cryptical ?.
IVe don’t know and we never shall.
Have quick feet borne her
To “Casey’s Corner” ?
Was it there he came to adore or scorn her?
And of all the places
With two-street faces
Where the crowds pass by, like the yeavs, fttgaces,
Now which and where is, I wonder, Casey’s.
No clue to tell us what fate it brought her—
Can you whisper, wind? Call you spill it, water?
“Is there no help for the widow’s daughter?”

“M.G.S.” : I .saw a quite well-known Aus-
tralian sculptor at work the. other morning:
he was putting a new foreleg on Diana s
hart in the Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne. It
is the best job he is likely to get at present.
There are a few sculptors in Australia who
could produce good stuff if there was any
demand for it, but the British race seems
to have all a Mohammedan’s dread ot the
graven image. That is why we are turning
from white-icing buglers to pagan cenotaphs.
A French artist told me, when the Edith
Cavell monument was revealed to the public
gaze in London, that if such an effigy were
to be unveiled in Paris the students of the
Latin quarter would get up and destroy it
overnight out of pure respect for a noble
woman’s memory.

“Hamer” : “Blind Freddy” is one of the
prosperous minor business men of Sydney.
His alert, well-groomed appearance seems a
strange accompaniment of his sightlessness.
Only the other day I saw two crowded
tram compartments
gape when he rose
briskly as the tram
reached the King-
street stop and
walked away, de-
clining assistance,
with a grateful
“I’m all rigli t,
thanks.” Actually
he can make his
■way almost any-
where in Sydney
without assistance,
though how he
dodges the motor-
cars is a mystery.
He has a regular
round of customers,
and his business
(tobacco and sun-
dries) seems a
prosperous one. I
remember a meet-
ing between Freddy
and a Sydney
artist after the
artist had returned
from the Avar —he
had not seen the
blind man for
years. “Do you
know who I am,
Freddy?” asked the
artist. “Why, it’s
Hughie Maclean !”
exclaimed Freddy
without a moment’s
hesitation. The un-
canny development
of his sense of
hearing has almost
made Blind Freddy
forget that he is
handicapped.
“TJlulah” : The Australian youngster is an
incorrigible leg-puller, and, further, is not
given to turning the other cheek to the
smiter. Some years ago two Jap warships
called at Townsville (N.Q.), and a fete was
held in the Botanic Gardens for the enter-
tainment of the officers. Two gold-braided
visitors got cut off from then; party, and
were wandering about when they accosted
an 11-year-old lad. “You go longa that road.
Timmy ” began the kid in the friendly way
he had been brought up in. me,
voung fellow,” interrupted the Jap, ’ but my
English is probably better than yours, and
my name is not Jimmy. The dreadful
nipper resented the tone of the rebuke, and,
to quote his own words, directed em to
Burdell’s pits.” Comment on the locality is
unnecessary further than to mention thai.
Townsville hasn’t- an up-to-date sewerage

“TTramao” : The Considerate Burglar has
turned up at Ask-
burton (M.E.),
where a woman
suddenly awakened
with an impression
that she had seen
a man in the room
fumbling at her
husband’s coat.
Dismissing it as a
dream, she dropped
off to sleep again,
and a while later
awoke to see the
man at the same
coat. There was
no mistake this
time, and she
aroused her hus-
band, but by that
time the burglar
had gone. Search
revealed that £35
had been abstracted
from the safe. The
burglar had first
come upstairs for
the key, and after
he had finished his
job had crept back
to the bedroom and
replaced it in the owner’s coat pocket.

•‘Derma”: The sale of the Riversdale
Golf Links for £lO2 000 is one of Melbourne’s
largest subdivision specs. The land is on the
Outer Circle railway line, which runs from
Ashburton to Camberwell and has lately been
electrified. This line has of recent years be-
come a payable proposition by reason of the

“Der Jong”: If the South African row
over the choosing of a national flag for
the Union has done nothing else, it has con-
tributed a priceless gem of mixed metaphor.
A few days ago J. C. Kemp, Hertzog’s Minis-
ter for Agriculture, told an audience that he
would refuse to accept the compromise of a
“mock Vicrkleur.” Said Kemp, who, by the
way, is of Irish blood: "We would rather
have even the Union Jack, so that we could
point to it and say to our children, ‘That
is the flag which trampled the Vicrkleur in
the dust, and set a foot on the necks of the
Afrikanders.’ ”
“Tim Tiki”: Macartliy's Brewery. Wei
lington (M.L.), is dealing out double-handed
philanthropy. The estate is run by the
Public Trustee, and the profits, which last
year amounted to £12,000, go to various
orphanages. Those who buy the beer do
themselves a good turn, too, inasmuch as it
is sold at 3d. a bottle cheaper than the
product of breweries which are run for
dividends. Some of the benefiting orphan-
ages are under the wins of churches which
are the demon Rum’s greatest enemies, but
none of them have protested yet. They’ve
split up £95,000 between them in the last
few years, and £95,000 is a great silencer.
* * * *
“Sixenate” : W.A. is about to see the rare
event of a murder trial five years after the
crime, though the authorities have had the
accused in hand all the time. John Samuel
O'Loughlin and Sydney James were partners
in a pastoral lease on the eastern goldfields.
They had a dispute which ended in the
former firing three charges from a breach-
loading gun into his partner. O’LoUghlin
gave no trouble over his arrest; but before
the case came for trial he was certified as
insane. Now a memo, from the Lunacy
authorities that he has regained his mental
balance has set the slow wheels of the law
in action again.
* * * *
“X.D.” : For a slave to conventionality you
can hardly beat the intending suicide. After a
quarrel with his wife, a Sydney man left
home, casually mentioning that his objective
was the Gap. On his way there he
utterly ignored various handy means to a
quick end, such as might result from being
run over by trains, trams or motor-cars,
jumping from high buildings or dropping
quietly off a ferry, but he so perturbed
fellow-passengers in the tramcar by his queer
actions that an effort was made to detain
him until the police could be informed. The
would-be suicide bolted, however, running
away in a direction which missed the road
to the Gap. From South Head to Ben Buck-
ler there are scores of places where a man
may launch himself into eternity with every
expectation of arriving there, but that would
have been violating the conventions ; so the man
tramped resolutely back to the Gap, where
John Hops, sent there at the urgent request
of his wife, grappled with him, and carried
him off to the Reception House. Another
suicide was recently stopped by a chemist
becoming suspicious after selling some
strychnine. The police dashed in just m
time to rush the man, who had taken it, to
hospital and a stomach-pump. Afterwards,
it came out that this slave of convention was
a process engraver who, at his work, daily
handles a poison which can hand out deatli
no less surely and quickly, and much more
easily, than the poison which old-established
tradition drove him to purchase.

“H.K.” : They tell of a prominent Crown
Law official who was on duty at the I >arling-
hurst (Sydney) Sessions the other day when
there was a line-up of suspects and others at
No. 3 Police-station across the road. As he had
always been curious to see the little act
staged, he volunteered to toe the line himself.
“Now, Madam,” said the police-officer to the
young lady whose handbag had been snatched
the night previously, “just look along the
line and see if you can recognise the man’'
It was a perfectly positive young miss wh ■

“Digbine”: When war was declared tn*
German possessions in the Pacific were, of
course, confiscated. In one well-known
colony a large sum of money in gold and silver
was on hand; just prior to the arrival ot
the Australian expeditionary force it was
removed to the territory of a neutral Power
and buried in large earthenware drainpipes.
Here it remained until a short time ago.
when the pipes were dug up at night and
the money placed in a large wooden chest,
which was later taken on board an inter-
island vessel sailing that night for the island
whence the money was originally removed. On
nearing port in the early morning the
naturalised American Hun in charge of the
specie had the chest thrown overboard with
a buoy attached; and it was picked up by
another Hun leaving that day for Hamburg
on a copra steamer. The chest of money was
on board the copra steamer almost as soon
as the inter-island vessel anchored in port
and ivas well out at sea by the time the
passengers got ashore.
“Oil Break”: “Retired Volt” shudders
over the risk run by the crew of a steamer
which hooked a power cable in Sydney
Harbor and brought it to the surface (B.

bubbles would have been seen rising if the
anchor had cut into the highly-stressed: vitals
of the cable, and the resultant shock would
have been equal to the discharge of a shot

SUNDAY IN BETWEEN.
[FOR THE NULLETIN.]
“You will be given every assistance to do your
best work among congenial fellow employees in an
atmosphere you will leave with regret on Saturday
and enter with increased enthusiasm each Monday
morning;”—S. M. Herald “jobs waiting” ad.
Our Angelina snared the job
Which hundreds more essayed to get,
And bade “good-bye” to Bibb and Bobb,
Without the very least regret.
Her spirits tipped the topmost peak.
And as for Angelina’s pay—
They asked her what she’d lik’e per week,
And paid it every other day.
They called her “Pet” and “Angel dear”
Pure bliss there was in tapping keys
In such a pleasant atmosphere,
With fellow-workers like to these.
But oh! the painful Saturday!
The awful parting with her mates!
She’d kiss them all a sad good-day,
And, sobbing, leave them to their fates.
And oh! the dreary Sabbath, when
Such blest employment was forbid!
What Angie bore in patience then
Th sufferings of saints outdid.
That was the fly the ointment held.
The day a gnawing hell became
Till ultimately she rebelled—
And anyone might do the same.
So Angelina left her job
And now the keys once more she taps
And keeps the books for Bibb and Bobb,
Entirely ordinary chaps.
You’ll always find it if you seek,
A bitter drop in every cup.
So bright and happy was her week
The strain of Sunday broke her up!

Taking a leaf out of the book of the
Polite Host, the Federal Parliament, in con-
sidering the Judiciary Bill, baulked at telling
their Honors to get out at 70, but inserted
a clause by which those who hang to their
High Court jobs after reaching that age
will lose 10 per cent, of their pension rights
for each year they so continue in office.
Twelve months’ grace is allowed to those
already on the Bench; at the end of that
time Higgins (who is 75), Gavan Duffy
(74), Powers (73) and Isaacs (71) will

George Dethridge, just lifted from the Vic.
County Court to be chief Judge of the
reformed Federal Arbitration Court, is 62
two years older than Irvine was in 1918 when
he was made C.J. of Victoria at the same
pay. £3OOO a year. It was generally felt
by wig and gown that Dethridge was flying
too low when he accepted the County Court
job in 1920. and, as judicial promotion is
rare in Vic., they were wondering what door
would be opened to enable him to go higher
Latham’s bill supplied the key and he was
beckoned up the stairs. He is a product
of V ic. His late brother, J.S., was second
member ot the Water Commission, and in-
vented an apparatus for measuring water
for irrigation supplies, which he gave freely
to the world.
George S. Beeby, Judge and litterateur,
was in the running for the N.S.W. Indus-
trial Commissionership which went to A. B.
Plddington. He now gets compensation by
his appointment as one of the Judges of the
Commonwealth Court of Arbitration. Beeby
as a solicitor developed a practice in the
Arbitration Court when it was a new thing
in . N*. S- Wales, and he has been associated
with industrial law as lawyer, legislator and
Judge ever since. As McGowen’s Minister
for Lands, with control of the Department of
Labor and Industry, he piloted the Indus-
trial Arbitration Act of 1912, which super-
seded “Wade’s Act”; and he has been an
Industrial Judge since 1920. Justice Lukin,
the other new Judge to serve under
Dethridge, spent his early life in the Queens-
land civil service. He received his appoint-
ment as Acting Supreme Court Judge in
1910; it was shortly made permanent. Beeby
is 57 and Lukin a year more, so they should
have far to go yet. 1

he was put up when extra-plausibility was

months with the assistance of his adroit
steersman, Tommy Bent. Allan completed
20 months last Saturday, and has to thank
his navigating lieutenant, the adaptable Alec
Peacock, for keeping off the rocks so long.
JUDGE MITCHELL, the commissioner who
is inquiring into the polio bribery
charges in Adelaide.
Mata Horomoana, cliieftainess of the
Ngatihuirapa tribe, of Maoriland, had the
pleasure of dangling her great-great-great-
grandchild on her knee before she crossed the
dark water. A decade ago sundry of her race
were whispering with awe that she was
immortal; the retention of all her faculties
and her remarkable memory of old Maori
events aided the superstition. The Maoris
reckoned she was 102 at the finish, but she
may have been younger—or older.
Coincidence can’t stretch much farther
than this. Two ancients of little Cowra
(N.S.W.) who closed their accounts on the
same day were Thomas and William Adams
unrelated, but fast friends. Thomas, reputed to
be 103, was in his prime a ringer whose
tallies were mentioned in shearing-sheds
when the doings of champions were dis-
cussed. He was a genial old sport, and saw
his last race-meeting just three weeks before
the end. To Thomas William was a boy
friend, yet he was old enough to have been
a carrier between Sydney and Cowra before
the. railway interfered with that business,
and he introduced the first reaper and binder
to the district.
A C.B.E. out of the latest Birthday bag
goes to Samuel Ilurst Seager, designer of
the Maoriland memorial on Gallipoli and a
number of others in France. Born in London
in 1858, he came to Christchurch as a
boy, went back to complete his education,
and returned to the Cathedral city in 1881.
He has designed many of its buildings and
is Maoriland’s chief town-planning expert.
When Dick Cooke of Toowoomba
presented his 78 inches of stalwart bulk at
Peter's Gate recently the Recording Angel
remarked that he came from Queensland,
was a good cattleman, and never let hungry
man, woman, child, horse or dog go short
of a square meal if he knew of their plight,
lie was 55 at the end, and Toowoomba
reckons he should have been allowed another
30 years at least.
Most of the Crimean veterans still extant
were at the scrap only as youngsters on
shipboard. William Arthur Murray, who
would have been 100 years old had he lived
until next February, played a more active
part. He was one of the bluejackets from
11.M.5. Terrible who took part in the
storming of. Sebastopol, and was wounded in
knee, hand and head. His injuries didn’t
keep him from helping to quell the Indian
Mutiny, and he also mingled in the Chinese
War. Then he came to Australia, where
he was given charge of the old rifle-range
at Moore Park. Sydney, and later of the
armory at Victoria Barracks. When
Federation came the Commonwealth autho-
rities reckoned the 75-year-old sarg.-major
deserved a holiday, and retired him.
A hardy old lady who did well for Aus-
tralia has died at Wellington (N.S.W.),
aged 92. She walked there from Windsor
when she was 12. The tramp was a family
affair. The little heroine of that long walk
over what was then very rough country
became Mrs. Cassel when she was 15. and
she had 19 children : all but four of them are
still alive.
Laid down the scalpel, after 40 years at
Newtown-road (Sydney), John ' Joseph
Flynn. He was one of the oldest honoraries
at St. Vincent’s Hospital, and was latterly
on the staff of the Blue Sisters at Lewisham,
where son Leo is medical superintendent.
He left nine children: four of the six sons
are medicoes, and most likely the others will
follow in father’s footsteps.
Those N. S. Wales people who get more
tnrills out of old china than agitate
a football barracker at a willing game
are demanding a museum of applied
art. Besides the State Governor and
some leading collectors, ( C. P. Laseron,
officer-in-charge of the art collections at the
Technological Museum, is to be a member
ot a Trust formed to raise the necessary
funds. Laseron can decipher tins history
of ancient crockery as easily as a punter can
spot losers. He served in the A.1.F.. but the
connoisseur wasn’t entirely obscured by khaki
even in the years of bloodshed. He has
written authoritative treatises on his pet sub-
ject dealing with the technical side. The
literary apostle of the collectors, of course,
is David McKee Wright, some of whose
poems on old china have been greeted with
rapture by collectors all over the world.
E. J. Sievcrs left the £1750 per annum job
of N.S.W. Valuer-General the other day to
set up in the real-estate business. He used
to be Chief Valuer in the old State Land
Tax Office (1896), and as Resumption
Officer the big Sydney "Rocks” and Peel
River purchases went through his hands.
Always too good a business man to relish
swathings of red tape, he will be happier,
and maybe more prosperous, in his new role.
Parnham Maynard, who has left a soul-
curing job in Brisbane to be rector of St.
Peter’s, Melbourne, is an Anglo-Catholic who
reckons that the worker isn't getting a fair
deal, and doesn’t care who objects to his
opinions. When he was at Mt. Morgan he
worked underground and on top so that he
might get the miner’s viewpoint. He got
it. He was about the only Anglican parson
in Australia who cheered for Tom Walsh
when that gentleman was encouraging Brit-
ish seamen to rat on their union and put
the Commonwealth in the cart —his reason
being that the Pommy seafarer has a darned
hard time and is an object for sympathy,
right or wrong. At college he paid as much
attention to science as to theology—he boasts
a B.Sc. degree—-and is not the first who
found the pair rather skittish in double
harness.
Lady Loughborough (formerly (Sheila < 'his-
holm, of Sydney) has got the inevitable
divorce from her husband. Divorce runs in
the Rosslyn family: the Earl, who has now
been thrice married, divorced his first wife,
the present Lord Loughborough’s mother,
and his second helpmate obtained a similar
TRAFFIC POLICEMAN: “Now; then, Miss
Australia, get a move on, earn’t ycr!"
decree from him. The Earl, apart from Ms
domestic adventures, is a many-sided noble-
man, having been an actor and a war corres-
pondent as well as a soldier and the author
of a book of rather sloppy reminiscences. The
original earl was Lord Chancellor of Britain
in good King George’s glorious days, but he
wasn’t a direct ancestor, the title passing
from him to a nephew.
When William Garner decided to becon :
a limber merchant and breeder of blood
stock, at old South Creek (St. Mary’s.
N.S.W.) over 60-odd years ago, there was
lost to literature a thoroughly humorous
writer. Born on the North Shore, he lived
to be King of St. Mary’s, and foundation
mernoer of everythin? within a radius of
30 miles. His sprightly step and great good
health till stepped in at 86 he attribu-
ted to a daily nip of kerosene.
William Stephen, who closed his innings
at 99, at Red Hill, Brisbane, left 256 descen-
dants : six children, 84 grandchildren. 163
great-grandchildren ' and one great-great-
grandchild.
THE [?]
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wrangle having reached the pass that all such
wrangles do,
1 sent a brief to Mr. Brass, one for his junior, too.
For no K.C. would enter court
Without a junior for support.
It violates his ethics chaste regarding things debarred,
His sense of dignity and taste, tradition, self-regard.
Though clear the ease, and he must win,
it’s like the Seventh Deadly Sin.
1 sent the brief, I sent the fee; then, with befitting
grace,
One day the great man said he’d like “a chat about
the ease.”
He's great on these informal chats.
“Without a fee?” The answer's “Rats!”
1 found him affable and bland; he asked me how 1
felt,
Called me “old chap” and shook my hand. With
warmth he seemed to melt.
Ho handed me a fat cigar
And slapped my back with “Here we -are!”
Said he, all smiles and courtly bow, “One thing
you’ve overlooked—
Retainers arc more usual now; I’ll have yours duly-
booked.
A trifling fee —yes, two-four-six.
No building without straw and bricks!
“Forgive me, too, I hear that Hide —you know that
he’s retained
As counsel on the other side? Well, Hide ha- not
disdained
To take a somewhat higher fee;
You’d hardly offer less to me.
“Now% though the issue’s plain as pie and clear upon
its face,
Aou ought to send a brief for my ‘opinion or the
ease.’
It rounds things off ; it’s often done
And the taxing clerk might let it. run.
“Advised already? Ah, hut now we've turned another
page ;
W hat T have said, you must allow, was not. at this-
er-stage.
Then next we'll tighten up loose joints
With a chat on—incidental poinf.-.
“Your pleas are wanting, too, in pep. We'll plan
some new surprise.
Some interlocutory step ,we surely can devise.
Some interrogatories p'raps,
Or summonses to till the gaps.
“Don't let impatience or ill-will suggest some swift
resource;
The case is in its childhood still and things must
take their course.
It’s early yet campaigns to plan.
Patience! I'll help you all I can.”
* * * *
My “simple ease” goes on its way with complex
things in train;
It may he tried some distant day, if parties stand the
strain.
Meanwhile we steer a course unsteady.
Both sides and Court are never ready.
Sometimes we have a minor spin and gain or lose a
point.
My client’s patience frays out thin, his smile is out
of joint.
These little bouts win faint applause,
For costs are mostly “in the cause.”
Sere is the grass, Time’s sands have run and suitors
vainly fret.
Through many a rise and set of sun the stage is not
yet set.
I sent a brief to Brass, K.C.;
He holds it for Eternity.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALLA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“AdeL”: Many thousand woolly-backs
have invaded parts of the Gulf country once regarded
as solely cattle land, and many more thousands
from drought-stricken localities are on their way to
areas farther west which have more or less benefited
by summer rains. West of the Gregory and Nichol-
son rivers are vast tracks of richly grassed, well
shaded and watered country as yet almost unstocked ;
but although sheep-owners are hard pressed to find
grass for their starving flocks they shy away from
these lands because of iromvood ( Erythrophlarum
labouckerii ), the sweetly-juiced, broad dark-green

leaves bf which are so much sought after by the
sheep and with fatal results. A peculiarity of iron-
wood is that the lower Gregory River forms the
eastern boundary of its native habitat. Although it
grows in plenty on the western bank of the river,
practically none can be found on the other side;
yet the country is similar, and the narrow stream
can hardly be thought of as an obstruction sufficient
to stay the spread of the poison wood further east.
* * * *
“Chancery Lane”: In the Vic. Supreme
Court Justice Scliutt lately liberated over 38,000,000
bees. The shire of Mihlura had passed and enforced
a by-law that no person, in February, March and
April, should keep within five miles of any horti-
cultural block planted with trees or vines a hive
of bees unless it was covered to prevent the insects
leaving. Although there was evidence that the
presence of bees in great numbers had been a
source of annoj'ance and damage to some fruit-
growers, the Judge was not satisfied that a nuis-
ance in the ordinary meaning of the term had been
shown to exist, and, therefore, in the interests of
the seven apiarists within the prescribed area, who
owned between them 38 million or so bees, he
ordered that the by-law be quashed. Whether bees
can pierce the skin of sound fruit is still hotly
debated within the area and elsewhere; but it is
certain that in some districts, at any rate, they
do attack fruit. Once an entrance is effected the
juice will ferment, and hundreds of bees can be
found in the fruit—peaches especially—or under the
trees well and truly shickered.
* * * *
“Jesmond”: The popular idea that nauti-
lus shells come ashore only every seven years (B.
24/6/’26) was probably started with the object of
increasing the price offered for them. I have lived
for years at Westernport Bay (Vic.) and pick up
several beauties every year, Holidaymakers are
keen after them and pay up to 30s. for a large and
perfect specimen, but perfect specimens are very
hard to find. They are not the true pearly nautilus,
but the paper nautilus or argonaut. The argonaut
shell is made only by the female, who uses it as a
shelter for her eggs and young. Surely this paper-
thin and beautifully-ribbed translucent shell is the
most wonderful cradle in nature.
* * * #
“L. Ross L.”: “Hiawatha's” paragraph:
(B. 24/6/’26) recalls a common sight in Port Said.
There, in 1914, I was amused to see the fowls
running about the streets with wings or tails dyed
all colors. I learnt that this was done in order
that their ownership might be determined with ease.
It was said to be a long established custom amongst
the native population of Egypt. Perhaps “Hia-
watha’s” friend imported the idea of branding his
poultry from there.
* * * *
“Bouragi” : The Japs, who did a lot to-
wards the discovery of the plague bacillus, claim
that they have at last hunted down the cause of
beri-beri, an ever-present scourge in eastern Asia.
It is not unknown in Australia, either; 23 deaths
from it occurred in 1925. For a long time it was
thought that it was caused by the absence of one
of the vitamines from the “polished” rice of commerce.
The great Sakae Higuchi now says the causative agency
is a fungoid bacillus which appears only in cleaned
rice and is not killed by boiling, and he Has
prepared a curative serum. Australia has a pretty
deep interest in the discovery, for her hangers-on,
Papua and New Guinea, have a great deal of trouble
with beri-beri, which occasionally causes serious
casualties among native laborers, who are largely
fed on imported rice.
* * * *
“Gilgandra” : The drover who utilised the
quiet cow for carrying his packs (B. 24/6/’26) was
not employing a new means. In 1914, just prior to
the big box-on, I was with a drover named Cameron,
bringing 200 cows and calves from Cunnamulla (Q.)
to Walgett (N.S.W.). We had six or seven horses,
but, owing to the scarcity of feed, left them behind,
and in their stead packed two old milkers. They
not only did excellent service as pack carriers, but
were invaluable at bridges and other crossings for
leading the mob. Moreover, we had a plentiful
supply of fresh milk from them, a rarity in the
camp of a “tea and sugar” drover.
* *- * *
“Lily-Bcale” : The “devil’s claw” seed-pod,
bearing a striking resemblance to the head of a
curlew, is causing sheepmen, especially in the Mud gee
district (N.S.W.), much concern. The beak part,
which is about four inches long, ending in a sharp
curve at the neck, is fitted with protecting claws,
six inches long, with sharp hooked points. The pod
is so shaped that the claws close on a sheep’s jaw
on each side of the nose, and the beak part hooks
underneath the jaw near the root of the tongue.
Thus muzzled, the sheep slowly starve to death,
being unable to eat or drink.
‘‘Chiffonier”: Entomologist Froggatt’s
“blowfly marking” experiments, to ascertain the area
of country covered by the sheepfly, has thrown the
spotlight on some of the habits of this curse. Their
success suggests an extension of the system. Birds
OLD STOCK. TOO.

“Believe mine ’ad somethin’ of the sort somewhere once."
"Bai Jove! And don’t you know where it was?”
"Oh, yes—in the Garden o’ Eden.”
which summer in Australia, but winter elsewhere,
might have their trails blazed by affixing to captured
specimens aluminium rings. The captives could
then be liberated and rewards broadcasted for their
recovery. It might also be tried on Brer Rabbit,
to find out how far the cottontails travel at various
seasons *of the year. The British Colonial Office
recently marked certain storks. The liberated birds
were found as far afield as Palestine, the banks of
the Blue Nile and Victoria Nyanza. Fish are also
being tagged by the 8.C.0., and the British Admi-
ralty has rediscovered a plaice which had travelled
210 miles in eight months. One large crab, having
been marked and released, was retaken 100 miles
away.
* # * *
“Nedland”: “Black Tracker’s” emu that
gobbled up the 15s. (B. 10/6/’26) wasn’t peculiar.
Emus are fond of bright metal, and small slugs of
gold picked up miles away from the reef are often
supposed to have been carried there by the birds
and voided in their excreta. I knew several old
hatters on the Coolgardie field who would follow an
emu’s track in the hope of coming across their dung
and examining it. In gold country the emu’s gizzard
is generally worth opening. I came upon some
niggers cooking a bird one day and on splitting
its gizzard my mate found quite a nice little slug.
* # * *
“Carjuu”: Cooktown (N.Q.) will take
some beating for the number of pubs to the one
street (B. 10/6/’26). In the olden days, when it was a
thriving mining town, it had 17 in the main street
—less than a mile long. There were four opposite
the post-office, and at an intersection a block further
along there were another five in a group. The
population has dwindled to less than 200 males,
babies and centenarians included, but there are still
seven beer-pumps left.
* * * #
“Uramao”: Attemi s to acclimatise part-
ridges in Maoriland have had small success. Back
in 1867, 10 common European partridges were intro-
duced to Canterbury. The following year 45 were
shipped, but only one survived the voyage. In the
’seventies big shipments were made, but ill-luck
attended these efforts. Some 30 years ago Hungarian
partridges were given a go; then the French
rCd-legged partridge and the Barbary variety, but
they all failed to thrive. Now a Canterbury sport
has made an experiment with 36 Chukar partridges
from India. The shipment has just arrived in good
condition, and there are hopes that the birds will
prove the right kind for MX.
* * * *
“Sandy” : In our district recently a prize
was offered for the best waltzing couple. The
judge, a local J.P. and dairyfarmer, awarded the
prize to a couple who were obviously below the
standard. After some consultation it was decided
to ask his Worship for his reasons. “What yer
coming at!” he exclaimed. “They are a waltzing
couple, ain’t they, and if they ain’t the best
milkers in the district, who can beat ’em?”
“Gregor”: There’s a good deal in “Two
Seas’s” story of the horse and the dog possessed
unaccountably of a fear of something their owner
could not see (B. 24/6/’26). A friend of mine had
an almost similar experience. He had rented an
old house oil the Blue
Mountains (N.S.W.).
His only companions,
on taking up residence,
were a collie dog and
a cat. One night he
•was-sitting in front of
a blazing fire reading,
the two animals
stretched out comfort-
ably alongside him.
Suddenly they awoke
with a start and stared
at a coiner of the room
which was apparently
quite empty and with-
out sign of anything
unusual about it. After
a minute or two of
gazing, the cat and the
dog began to manifest
signs of acute fear,
bordering on panic.
The hair on their backs
stood stiffly, they
growled and whined
an d both pressed,
trembling, as close to
the man as they could
get. They kept this up
for several minutes,
never once taking their
eyes away from the
corner. Suddenly they
stopped their strange
behavior and displayed
every sign of relief—
the object of their fear
had seemingly dis-
appeared. For the rest
of the night they kept
as close as possible to
their master, a profes-
sional man with little
belief in spooks or any-
thing of a supernatural
nature. Never after-
wards could they be
got into that room
without difficulty, or if
forced in without
showing eagerness to
get out.
“Morob” : The Netv Guinea natives’ fear
of the wild raspberries found growing in the mountains
mentioned by “Tamornie” (B. l/7/’26) is explained
by the fact that at certain seasons these berries
contain a poison capable of killing a full-grown man,
if he assimilates sufficient of it. During a short
period in the middle of the r ear they are eatable,
but even then their consumption is attended with
some risk. Some people can devour them with
greater safety than others, who suffer severely after
eating only a few of the berries. 1 do not know
to what class the toxic body in ( them belongs, but
possibly it; may be related to the strychnine of the
nux vomica plant, which is not unlike that on
which the berries grow. The symptoms are almost
identical with those of strychnine poisoning. In
a tropical country it is safest to cat what the natives
eat and leave alone what they won’t touch.
WHAT A MAN S GOT TO PUT UP
WITH NOW.
“Boss in?”
“Yairs —Vs list coin’ in.”
“Listenin’ in what?”
“In ’is ear —whatcher think?"
“Cuchulain”: A rabbit caught on Lynd-
hurst station (N.S.W.) the other day, possessed a
remarkable set of teeth. One tooth was 3in. long,
two nippers had the curling shape of a ram’s horn,
and four others were twirled upwards and pointed
to the inside of the jaw. The remarkable set was
completed by two smaller teeth, of more ordinary
shape.

HOGAN’S FIND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hogan's Find is a field forsaken..
Lit by the glare from Lake Lefroy.
Only the nomad gales awaken
Dust on the flats by woe o’ertaken;
Want that stalked in the wake of joy.
Lost on the wide Westralian spaces!—
Haze swims in from the ridges red,
Floods in the noon and then retraces
Under the night sky’s melting graces,
Merged in the moon’s rich lustre shed.
Ghosts of a reckless host departed
Work their claims in the haunted hours—
Men who hammered and drilled stout-hearted,
Measured the silent wastes uncharted,
Plucking the thorns that shed no flowers.
Under the stars they screen the gravel,
Down in the dark their candles flame.
Rays of the lifting moon unravel
Ribbons of beaten pad they travel,
Eager for toil, from camp to claim.
Picks are thudding and spades are flashing,
Stamp-shoes thunder on broken ore,
Spawler-heads on diorite smashing
Threaten the gravel cascades splashing
Over the shaker screens once more.
Lights from a hundred shanties flaring
Kindle the hearts of all mankind,
Flouting the march of time unsparing,
Squandering wealth and laughter sharing,
Keeping the night at Hogan’s Find !

CYANOGAS (Calcium Cyanide)
NEVER FAILS TO WIPE OUT EVERY RABBIT.
Cyanogas does the job thoroughly with one application. No
rabbit in a W'arren treated with Cyanogas can escape destruction.
Cyanogas is best applied with the Fumo Dust Blower.
If used according to directions, it is speedy., sure and economical.
If you have any difficulty with either the Dust or the Blower,
let us know, and we shall be glad to put you right.
Wipe out every rabbit on your land by
fumigating with Cyanogas.
0. Davis, Dampon, Scone, writes:
“Re Calcium Cyanide Dust. We did great
work last season with it in thinning out the
rabbits. Where they were very thick last
season, there is hardly a rabbit to be seen
now.

“Fitz”: The Manning District (N.S.W.)
takes some beating in lots of ways; and the State
Governor unearthed there the most remarkable bullock-
driver on earth. His Ex. met him on the Lans-
downe, near AVingham. AA’illiam Henry is the
chap's name, and he has passed his 68th year. He
doesn’t drink and he doesn’t swear, even at bullocks.
According to reliable history, he hasn’t used sulphuric
language to his gentlemen cows for over 20 years, and
he finds they appreciate the courtesy. He knows
how to handle his oxen, and gave the Governor a
demonstration showing how a team of 20 can be
turned on a sixpenny-bit or thereabouts by the
aid of a Oft. whip unassisted by a single swear-word.

“\V erriinee”: I knew a liorsebreaker who
always trained his mokes to stand with the bridle
reins trailing on the ground. Near his home he had
a post sunk out of sight in the ground, with a
stout ring bolted to the top of it. Strong plaited-
hide reins were used on a young horse, and when the
moke-moulder dismounted he tied the ends of them
to the ring. For a few times the colt would try
to walk away, and perhaps hang back, only to
find himself securely anchored. Ever afterwards
when the reins were dropped, in town or bush,
neddie would stand till wanted, under the impres-
sion that lie was tied up.

I got hold of another authentic case? My shell-
opener picked the pearl out of the oyster, but let
it slip through his fingers. It bounded off the
gunwale into the sea; but one of the Japs, more
quick-witted than the rest of the crew, instantly
jumped overboard and caught the pearl before it
had gone too far down. It was worth £25 to him.

“Nitric”: A botanical discovery of inter-
est, a new species of pandanus, has been made in North
(Queensland. The species was found growing along per-
ennial streams about 20 miles s.-w. of Burketown. The
nuts are the favorite food of two species of turtle
in the streams along which this pandanus grows.
Botanically the tree is of interest as being a repre-
sentative of the screw pines ( Hombronia ) not previ-
ously recorded in Australia. The tree has been named
l’andanus de Lestangii after its discoverer, A. de
Lestang, a frequent contributor to the Abo. columns.
“Gui”: The force exerted by a 2in. nozzle
under 200 ft. head (B. l/7/'26) depends on the
material of the pipe, whether there are any bends,
and on the type of inlet and nozzle orifice. Taking
tbe pipe as galvanised-iron with one right-angle bend
a+ - the end and an ordinary plain nozzle, the force
exerted is approximately three-quarters of a ton.

“Wandi” : The lasso is not a monopoly of
the American cowbov.
It was introduced on
Innainincka station
about, the beginning of
the present century,
and its success there
induced other run-
holders in west Queens-
land and northern parts
of S.A. to adopt it.
These central runs are
wide and for the most
part unfenced, and, the
feed being patchy, the
cattle wander about in
scattered mobs. At
mustering times they
dre rounded up on the
nearest timbered camps,
where there is wood for
branding-fires. The
cleanskins, big an d
little, are lassoed by
skilled men, and hauled
up by the stockhorses
to a couple of forked
trees, the lasso being
passed over a fork to
steady the captive so
that the branders can
throw it where, they
want it. White men
are generally more ex-
pert with the lasso
than the aboriginal
stockman; but one of
the smartest on Dur-
ham Downs, a big run
on the W.Q. border,
was a one-armed abo-
rigine, who held the
bridle reins with his
teeth when easting the
noose.
“Up Top”: Up near the Fingerpoint there
thrives a weeping fig, one portion of its hollowed
butt so trellised over with bark as to form almost
a new covering. On peering through the inter-
laced bark, you are grinned at by a yellowish-
brown skeleton. The bones are mildewed, though
the natives swear that with the dying of the moon
the spirit comes back to it and laughs aloud. The
legend tells that he was the lover of the chief’s
wife. The pair eloped, but were betrayed by a
ray of moonlight as they lay in one another’s
arms. The warriors hollowed out one side of the
fig, chiselling the wood in strips as a guide for
the bark to grow over. Romeo was fastened within,
and for a time was kept alive on wild figs.

“Hcrodot” : References to swindles worked
with faked warrigal tails recall that a man was
once caught keeping a
dingo farm. It was in
a district of N.S.W.
where the pests were
numerous and the
bonuses fairly high.
The farmer’s method
• was to catch the pups
and, their scalps being
worth only a few shil-
lings, to rear them
until they were old
enough to qualify for
the full bonus. He kept
them in a wire-netted
enclosure, and as their
howling at night
attracted other dingoes,
he frequently secured
good bags. The scheme
had been working
profitably for some time
when incautious talk
resulted in detection.
When a raid was
carried out, 14 dingo
pups of various ages
were found in the en-
closure.
“Si Ami”: Native Malaya hasn’t any
S.P.C.A. I was out with an indigene one day when
we came across, a starving blind kitten. [ raised
my gun instinctively to put the finish to its misery,
but Sibik caught my arm and said: “Don’t kill a eat
—it’s the worst kind of bad luck!’’ Then I learned
of the local way of circumventing Nemesis. They
blind the unwanted animals and turn them out in
the jungle to die.

“L.B. ’: A resident in Temora (N.S.W.)
was recently cleaning out the guttering on the
roof of a local church, when he noticed a pigeon
fly up from where he was working. lie' investigated
and found in the guttering a nest, and in the nest
a tennis ball which was quite warm. Apparently th<
pigeon was under the impression that this was
an outsize in eggs, and was gamely trying to hatch it.
“Billy See”: The yarn of the lost-pearl
having been told, here is the yarn of the lost nugget.
Hack in 1906, when the Great Gold Leak Commission
was sitting in Kalgoorlie, there was a stampede of
gold-buyers. One night the detectives got informa-
tion that a well-known dealer would call at a
certain place to lift a big lump of smelted gold. His
way home led across the alluvial fiat which runs
WHERE SILENCE IS GOLDEN .
DONAL’ : “Sandy, I wadna put it that way—courtesy costs
n[?]thin’.”
SANDY: “Weel, onyway, Ah’m no' goin' tae put ony ‘Dear sir ' or
‘Yours sincerely' tue a telegram.”
parallel to the Kalgoorlie-Boulder railway line, and,
being anxious to catch the offender with the goods
on him, the sleuths hid in a big dryblower’s hole
alongside the" track. Shortly after 10 p.m. their
man came along, and as he passed they grabbed him.
But as they leaped he drew the gold from his coat
pocket and threw it away. His captors gave him
a run over, but could find nothing, and so had to
let him go. For days after wards they searched round the
spot, looking into every hole and possible hiding
place, but not a speck of gold could they find. When
they had finished, the gold-buyer himself came and
had a look, but with no better result. Years passed
and the war came. The gold-buyer went to the
Front and saw it nearly through; then a bullet
got him close to the lung and invalided him. A
couple of years ago, being hard up. he went specking
on the worked-out alluvial in the hope of picking up
a bit of gold after heavy rain. Strolling round he
came near the place where the .detectives had inter-
cepted him 18 years before. His eye caught the
glint of gold in a heap of rubble. It proved to be
the corner of his long-lost ingot. It had fallen into
a cone-shaped heap of fine gravel tailings, and the
detectives, having seen an old fossicker working
there, hadn’t thought of searching his tailings heap.
The ingot passed through the mint as smelted
allnvial gold, and the ex-gold-dealer got the best
part of a Ford out of it.

“Tourist” : Visitors to Huskisson (N.S.W.)
should not fail to visit “the Colonel,” an old. resi-
dent living in a shack on a sand peninsula with the
waters of Jervis Bay on one side and Curambene
Creek on the other. In a novel way the Colonel
obtains an apparently unlimited supply of cold, fresh
water. Four or five butter-boxes with the tops arid
bottoms knocked out have been joined together and
set into the sand so as to form a miniature well
about 6ft. deep. At high tide, though only a strip
of about a dozen yards of sand separates the water
of the bay and the salt-water creek, the well in the
centre is always half full of fresh, cold water.
* * * *
“Wang-”: Not many bush churches can
boast of a bell-; , but our district rejoiced in the
possession of a cracked piece of ironmongery, hung
high up in the fork of a tree, with a tope attached
to the tongue. At the lower end of the rope was
a hook, which was hung on a ring fitted into the
tree trunk when the unmusical instrument wasn't
being operated. The ring was driven in high up on
the tree to prevent the youngsters of the neighborhood
airing their musical proclivities on week days.
To reach the ring and Unhook the rope, the bell-
ringer, a decrepit old resident, utilised a stepladder,
on which he would stand pulling away till the
parson had got off the mark. One Sunday, just as
his reverence was opening the service, the congrega-
tion was startled by a clangor like that of 50 fire-
brigade engines, with an undercurrent of shrieks.
The congregation rushed outside and found the old
bellringer swinging about in mid air, with the
hook caught firmly in the waistband of his pants or
somewhere thereabouts. The stepladder was lying
on the ground. An energetic parishioner grabbed it
up, and. planting it against the tree, endeavored to
unhook the bellringer, but only succeeded in making
the hook work its way in more firmly, judging from
the renewed outcry of the victim. Finally some
resourceful soul rushed a buggy under him while
another sawed at the rope with a knife. When the
ancient came safely to earth his remarks on the
whole science of campanology were comprehensive
and forceful. The bell was missing next church nay,
and we kids were unjustly blamed for purloining it.
We reckoned we knew the real culprit.

“Atherton”: In the Far North the jacket
of the big paper-bark tree supplies an ideal mattress
and blanket for the bushed wanderer. The bark, an
inch thick, is composed of many soft layers and
can be stripped quickly with the help of a stick.
A sheet on the ground is comfortable and waterproof,
while another sheet above supplies warmth and
defies rain. Being very oily it blazes instantly when
other wood is sopping. The natives use the bark
extensively for waterproof gunyahs, and one par-
ticularly fastidious Gulf tribe make their gins adorn
and wear an apron of it.
* * * *
“Strict Veg.”: An old bushman told a
Melbourne parson many years ago at Quearibeyan that
“Canberra” was derived from two Abo. words
meaning a woman’s breasts, two smoothly curving
hills in the vicinity suggesting the pleasing image
to poetic Black Brother. If there is anything
in the story, then Dryberra, like Babylon, stairs
off with a symbol of fertility, at any rate.
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: We mot her between
Gaffney’s Creek and Wood's Point, riding man fashion
and coming at a 10-mile bat. She had three small
nippers roosting behind her and a still smaller one
in front. As she came abreast of us we greeted her
with a hearty cheer, whereupon she pulled her nag
up, with a jolt that nearly unshipped the little crowd
travelling aft, and inquired rather tartly what all the
excitement was about. It was explained that a lady
who could handle a horse in the way she did and
attend to four nippers as well was entitled to some
encouragement. She seemed to see the point and
remarked that that kind of thing was an,everyday
occurrence in the hills, otherwise a woman would
never he able to go out at all.
“Fitzjay”: In reply to the inquiry by
“Dead Finish” (B. 24/6/’26) as to the age a horse
may reach, there appears to be a fairly general
impression that he is a short-lived animal. As a
matter of fact many horses are worked up to 35
years of age, and, if decently eared for, may live to
40 years. As amongst humans, there are cases of
abnormal longevity, but they are rare.
“Lilli-pilli”: Just before the war my dad sold
to a Lithgow (N.S.W.) resident a dark chestnut
pony which was reckoned old when it was the pet
of the Jenolan Caves caretaker’s children 30 years
previously. It passed from owner to owner in Lithgow
until two years ago, when it was sold to someone
in Bathurst and “faded away” as far as I am
concerned. This gelding had the longest body-
in proportion—l’ve seen on a nag. Perhaps that
had something to do with his longevity, just as long
necks are said to he indicative of long life in humans.
“Lily-Beale”: I don’t know what age a horse can
live to, but should say that anything over 30 years
i 3 unusual. On Bungle Gully station, near Walgett
(N.S.W.), there is an old mare that has seen 43
summers, and although somewhat stunted and stiff
IT WA S FATAL.
DAD : “I don’t believe in all this extrava-
gance. Why, in my day people used to
live on half as much.”
Sis : “But just think how many of them are

in the legs she looks good for a few more. Albert
Brouff, of Wilgabar, Walgett, had an old creamy horse
that at 82 carried him to the sick-bed of his mother.
The distance was 120 miles. But the effort proved
too much for old Jack, and he dropped dead that
night.
SUNDAY BELLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dew on the grassy uplands stretching forward,
Bloom of the grape on brown hills far away,
And blown above the blue waves sparkling shoreward,
The Sunday bells across Corio Bay.
All in the golden quiet of the morning
Knee-deep in wildflower weed and feathery grass,
Only the sapling’s crown my roof adorning,
I hear the airy echoes pause and pass.
Down the low wind the silver clamor surges,
Swells to its full, and faintly ebbs away,
< tic with the infinite fields of azure merges
The sound of bells across Corio Bay.
Phantasies old of other years awaking
Fragments of lost delight and morning prime ;
Strung on a strand of silver numbers shaking
All the warm airs of drowsy summer time.
There was a year we used to walk together
Through the tall grasses by a ferny brae,
Hearing adown the fairy golden weather
The Sunday bells across Corio Bay.
1 wonder if your happy ghost goes straying
Over the headlands to the grassy hill?
The sleepy things the sighing pines are saying
To the soft waters, are you hearing still
Where harps JEolian with the waters blending
Make muted interludes among the trees?
I cannot tell, I only know the ending
That left me lonely with my memories.
The bells grow silent and the last note lingers,
Down the green aisles the echo dies away:
Surely I felt the touch of unseen fingers
Hearing the bells across Corio Bay.
VICTORIA.

SILK
STOCKINGS
The most interesting spot in Sydney this
week is the Exhibition Hall of the Educa-
tion Building. Here on view are 800 of
the entries in a frock competition organised
by the Sun. These frocks had t<> cost not
more than 80s., and were not to he the work
of professional dressmakers. The result is
an astonishing display of garments that in any
up-town shop would cost guineas. They are
all afternoon or street models, in which the.
semi-ensemble and the tunic suit loom large.
They are fashioned of marocain, of serge, of
flannel and of rep, and for stitchery, neat-
ness of finish and daintiness of detail will
hold their own in the best circles. The first
prize goes to a cape frock, dashing and yet
demure, carried out in navy serge. Thirty
yards of narrow silk braid and 1L dozen
buttons are used in the de luxe effect it
creates, and from pattern to sewing silk the
cost of it was £1 Is. Ofd. The winner
is Mrs. Olive Perko, a waitress at Farmer’s.
The second prize was won by a sales-girl,
the third (for a pet of a princess robe in
grey) by a felt-hat machinist; and the fourth
goes to a sales-girl. The stenographers and
office-girls who competed failed mostly in
the art of buying—for which high marks wei*e
given ; but that, of course, may be due to
i'he lack of free hours on Saturday morning
or during the week in which to learn their
shops. The Governor’s daughter Elaine
(herself an amateur dressmaker) opened the
show—which is free to all—on Tuesday.
But the really important happening of the
week was the big rally of cancer crusaders
at the Town Hall. It was high noon when
the army headed by Sir Dudley met to dis-
cuss an offensive against the deadly peril.
Research work hacked by strong gold sup-
ports was the action decided on to rout the
enemy. The Uni. will contribute the re-
search, the man in the street the gold.
Already £12,000 has been gleaned in amounts
that run from shillings to thousands, and
Government grants and contributions such
as the Archibald bequest have put in hand
more than a quarter of the hundred thou-
sand aimed at. Minister for Health George
Gann, Dr. Holmes, of the Commonwealth
Health Department, Dean Talbot and Uni-
versity chieftains like knights Mungo Mac-
Callum and William Cullen cried the grow-
ing 'terror of the disease. But the woman in
the audience felt as though the black wing of
Azrael had brushed her cheek when the
enormity that faced her world was breathed
aloud —one in every eight is marked down
as a victim of this pitiless monster.
Not wigs on the green, but wigs on the
shingle, was the war-cry of the feminists at
their hall last week. Powdered hair and
silvery wigs, stiff and spreading brocades
and provocative patches turned the Went-
worth hack to that romantic age when the
women were all beauties and the men all
wits. The special attraction of the evening
was the presentation of three famous Watteau
paintings: "The ►Singing Lesson,” “The Love
Lesson,” "The Dancing Lesson.” Posed at
the top of the ballroom, in the setting of an
old-fasliionecl gilt frame, these tableaux
breathed the charm of other days. Mrs.
A. C. Godhavd was the active president of
the committee and wore the newest combina-
tion in evening colorings—white and silver.
The committee had cast a wide net to catch
the judges of the pageant, and the haul
landed Princess-by-matrimony Melikoff, Billy
Hughes’s Dame Mary and Knight Frederick
Waley. Heaven knows what claims they
possess for judging period clothes, but they
worried through, the prize list was
duly made out and, the decisions meeting
with polite applause, the dance proceeded.
Ruby Rich, very stunning in jade and silver
brocades, gained a special prize, and May
Sheehan, too, who made a charming Early-
English lass, carried an award home in her
suit-case.
The Undergrads, reserved their hop till
the polo togs were on their way hack to the
land; then the young spirits of the Uni.
effervesced and sparkled till the Palais was
a vast bottle of champagne. The immature
male this year, too, showed his good sense
by imploring the aid of the fair girl; so the
committee was as evenly matched as Noah’s
guest-list for the historic water-party.
Nearly 1500 very young men and women
put a laugh into the nmht such as July rarely
knows. Sir Dudley and Elaine came at aii
early hour with the Government House
guests, Sir Roderick Jones and Mr. Richard-
son-Hall. To these president of the Under-
grads Saxby gave the freedom of the ball,
and the same he extended later to her Ex.,
who came on from the Backhaus concert
with Susan Spencer, who wore a head that
shone like silk above purple pansy georgettes.
Cady de Chair made the night prouder in
her best line of pearls and brocades, in which
tliq pink of the lilac was thickly woven with
silver threads. Elaine mingled the greens
of the Celadon plate and silvery laces with
eminent success against the black and gold
of the ’Varsity colors that draped the vice-
regal enclosure. With the short kilts of her
day the blue stocking looks with great care
not only to her head but to her heels —not
to mention the parts that grow between—so
the dance was easily one of the best-dressed
of the season.
The frost in the air on Friday night
didn’t settle on the Old Sydneians’ dance in
the school-hall at Sydney Grammar. The
James Fairfaxes, with their knightly honors
still in bud, came in a presidential capacity,
and with other old Grammarians even to
the second generation danced with more ox-
loss abandon under a latticed canopy of
black and gold streamers. A profusion of
balloons added to the baccliic spirit of the
night, though headmaster H. S. Dettman’s
libations were jovially academic rather than
alcoholic. His tall lady added jocund greens
and silvers to the colorful lioui*, and James
Fairfax’s lady’s sables might have easily
headed the Wanted column in the family’s
Herald. Wanted?—only the timidity of our
eiiete civilisation saved that wrap from being
forcibly carried off by covetous females.
A great wave of excitement broke over
the Ambassadors on Friday night when the
Sydney Rowing iClub swept with a long pull
(and a deep one, too) into its 18th annual
ball. There was a tremendous rally, so that
dancing became a problem that set even the
mathematical Dr. Borse puzzling. The vice-
regals, who arrived early, stayed late, her
Ex. stepping through the maze in periwinkle
blues thickly sown with the pearly crop of
sister Oyster. His Ex. took a turn, com-
fortable and righteous, with the black-
georgetted Mrs. Shadforth, who was presi-
dent of the ball committee, and the Viking’s
daughter, in roseate georgettes, wove a busy
pattern of her own into the jazz design.
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh arrived under the
escort of dignified Town-Clerk Layton, and
later her Mayoral uncle joined the party.
Old Newingtonians tossed their annual
ball down the Wentworth last week while
the school banners ramped aloft, and the
scent of the l’ose and carnation fought a
battle to the death with the more perva-
sive scent of face-powder and talc. The
Eric Kelynacks were the big gnus of the night,
and extended the welcoming hand to reps,
of every big secondary sclyxol in the city ;
Joey’s, Riverview, Grammar, Sydney High,
C. of E. Grammar, St. Aloysius, Scots’ and
King’s all found a seat at the principal
board where Mrs. Kelynack hostessed in
black georgettes on which gold roses bloomed.
Sydney still remembers the silky red-gold
hair of Beatrice Kelly, the Bertie Kellys’ eldest
daughter. For the last two years she has
been studying
art in Flor-
ence, and for
the present has
given up the
idea of being
an architect —
the top of her
ambition when
she left Aus-
tralia. She is
already-acquir-
ing a quiet
little recogni-
tion as an
etcher of
charm in that
city stored
with great
masters, and
buyers pati-
ently climb the
three steep
flights of stairs
that lead to
iter studio overlooking the Ponte Vecchio,
Incidentally, her pencil had its Florentine
training from one who was a student with
Sydney’s own Dattilo Rubbo.
And this Letter can't close without a cheer
for the Wesley College dance. This put a
glow into the early part of last week, and
was one of the gayest functions ever held in
the University Union.
To the accompaniment of rich foods and
sparkling wines, Frenchmen in Sydney last
week commemorated the fall of the Bastille.
There were the usual polite calls at the Con-
sulate during the forenoon, when the most
friendly relations of France and Australia
were stressed, and the amiability of France
towards all nations insisted on by Consul-
General Nettement. The sparkle was put
into the celebrations by the dance in the
evening. Here young Franoe-in-Australia,
in full view of the tricolor and the cross,
jazzed so heartily that the floor of Dun-
gowan is still giddy. A group of officers
from the Ville d’Amiens, and a party of
schoolboys from Noumea on their way to
French colleges, put the last bubble on a
night of great memories.
This is a little May Moore picture of John
Lane Mullins, one of Sydney’s most public-
spirited men.
His chief an-
xiety is the
art instinct of
the citizen,
and how to
train it. A
trustee of the
National Gal-
lery, he has
been appointed
a trustee also
of the pro-
posed Museum
of A ppl i e d
Art, which is
the subject of
the hour in
collec tors’
circles. In his
h o m e at
Double Bay he
has stored one
of the conti-
nent’s mo s t
comprehensive collections of the works of
Australian poets and painters; from it he
has already presented Santa Sophia, the
new Catholic Women’s College within the
Uni., with several valuable early editions,
and has promised a collection of pictures for
the college walls. A scholarship worth £5O
a year, to be known as the Jane Lane Mul-
lins, in memory of his wife, is another of
his gifts to the college.
Four ladies who hill themselves as the
Kendall String Quartette are now in Sydney
giving recitals at the Adyar Hall. Their
leader is a tall, good-looking English girl,
Katherine Kendall, who has an intimate
knowledge of writing as well as of musical
London, and the group represents four dif-
ferent schools of music—Paris. Vienna,
Dresden and London. From England they
have reached us by way of “the East” and
Maoriland. In Ceylon, at the Trinity Col-
lege in Kandy, the quartette played before
an audience made up of 10 different native
races. In the steamy heat of Java, where
their own instruments became disembodied
almost before their eyes, they played on bor-
rowed shawms and dulcimers to one,of, the most
musically alert houses they have known. In
Ceylon they visited the Mrs. Dewhurst who
will live in history as the unconscious in-
strument of Suzanne Lenglen’s fall from
royal grace. Mrs. Dewhurst, who is Cey-
lon’s champion tennis-player and a cousin
of Dorothy Brook (one of the quartette-),
was then preparing for her visit to Wimble-
don, where the fiery Suzanne kept her—and
the royalties—-waiting an hour for the
singles in which they were to meet.
Across Phillip-strect, from chimney-pot to
chimney-pot, lines of bunting, looking listless
and depressed in Friday’s dullness, heralded
the opening of the Ideal Homes Exhibition.
Lady do Chair did the opening act in the
lecture room above the liall of exhibits, hut
her audience was not unnaturally dis-
tracted by a floral replica of the cottage next
door which had been presented to her by
the management. The official blessing over;
the interest centred in the Ideal Home
itself. It consists of a living-room, a pocket-
handkerchief lounge, two bedrooms, a sleep-
ing-out porch with dressing-room, a dazzling
bathroom and a kitchen complete even to a
fire extinguisher and a mauve duster. The
home is furnished to the nth degree, and is
replete with window seats and bookshelves,
boot cupboards and broom cupboards. There’s
a garage in the back yard and a playing

The By do Home for Incurables will benefit
by a dance held at the Wentworth midway
through last: week—a great success, of course,
like every function in aid of the House of
the Lost Hope. Such good friends as the
Fred Searls, the Harold Arnotts, the Spen-
cer Bruntons, Eric Lawsons, Triggs and
T. A. Fields brought parties and fine frock-
ing, and early spring flowers in intoxicating
profusion languished on every table.
Handsome Maurice Tuohy, who died sud-
denly last week-end, had for long been the
great male draw at the Fuller-Ward New-
town theatre. A native of Clare (S.A.), he
had been on the stage for 10 years. For the
greater part of six of them he studied a new
part each week. On the boards he lvad been
married 100 times, divorced 57 times,
fathered 128 kiddies and survived 2.'! sen-
tences of death. His father, formerly a sub-
inspector of police in South Australia, was
evidently as dashing in his day as his good-
looking son. For saving life during the
wreck of the Star of Greece he held both the
Humane Society’s medal and a special gold
medal from the S.A. Government. Maurice
not long ago became engaged to Lily Molloy.
of the Fuller stock company.
To help the orphans of Westmead, Ella
Caspers (now Mrs. Maloney, of Taree) will
break five years’ silence at the Town Hall on
July 28. The programme includes many
other stars, Alfred O’Shea among them.
Australian lasses don’t browse well on
strawberry leaves. Still another who broke
into the higher stratum of English society
is leaving it through the door of divorce.
This time it is Lady Loughborough, one-time
Sheila Chisholm, of Sydney. The husband
has been twice involved in spectacular bank-
ruptcy proceedings, and for several years the
lady has been keeping herself and her two
children out of her personal income.
Two new engagement-rings that are shed-
ding lustre on Sydney are worn by Doll
Campbell and Evelyn Mackellar. The first,
a daughter of the Goorianawa family, is
about to link up with Dr. E. L. Milgrove,
of Croydon ; the second has given the right
answer to Bill Crossing’s question.

Was got off with no worse than a little
buffeting.
Every Australian who knows Hongkong
lias been told the life-story of Sir Catchick
Paul Chafer. Arriving there about the time
of the Crimean War, an orphan boy and
desperately poor, he lived to become one of
the richest merchants in Asia; and when he
died lately, aged 80. Hongkong said it had
lost its greatest man. An Armenian by
birth, Chater had a generous streak in his
character, along with some eccentricities, and
his gifts were princely. The churches shared
largely in them —when the fires of youth died
down he became a devout Christian.
Miss Brisbane’s busy week: —
Pavlova pirouetted straight into the hearts of
Brisbane audiences, and the early door queue became
a perfect boa constrictor across the pavement of
Queen-street, an old Brisbane custom which is shortly
to be a thing of the past, according to the ordering
of the City Council. At all performances she received
beautiful flowers. For the matinees, women sat on
the stairs uncomplainingly, as only women can, from
ten in the morning till after one o'clock, and the
reserves were packed nightly. This is one of the
best booms the Finn has found in Brisbane for years,
For Clover Thompson, who is marrying Neil
Jackson, son of the E. S. .Jacksons, Betty Scott had
a mah-jongg' party at. Finney’s. The hostess was in
blue kasha and black felt hat. Clover Thompson wore
cream with burnt-orange hat. Her sister ATleen
scored the mah-jongg prize.
Another function for a bride-elect was given by
Merna Gillies in the Women’s Club. Her brother,
Dr. Gillies, is marrying Irene Butler Woods this
week at the pro-Cathedral. The guest of honor, in
navy with black satin turban, received a posy of
sweet-peas and the tea-tables were sweet with pink
roses, sweet-pea and fern, hidden amongst pink
and mauve tulle, with hand-painted .guest cards.
Cunnamullu has had a big hospital ball to aid
the funds. Fancy dress was worn, and Mrs. Mac-
donald, in Persian attire, won first prize for best dress.
A debating circle has been formed at the Women’s
Club and “The Clash of Color’’ was furiously threshed
last week. Then there was music, arranged by
Mabel Zi liman, to soothe the savage breast.
Pearl Lahey is another bride-to-be who is having
tea poured for her. The last libation was at a
tennis party given by Jessica Archibald.
Emanuel College has been at home to the warm-
ing jazz. Roses, poinsettia and blue streamers decked
the supper tables and sapphire, crimson and yellow
lights cheered the grounds. Mrs. Mervvn, in black
jetted-mariette, helped her Reverend to greet the
crowd.
Passed over, in her 73rd year, at Beerwah, Mary
Catherine Scott, who came here as a baby with her
father, Arthur Martin. She married Walter Scott,
of Taromeo station, a member of the Leg. Assembly,
and managed the property for seven years after his
death in 1890.
Freda Bage Inis had more parties to elieer her
departure. The D. E. Evans and Ray Stanley
matrons arranged one at Lennon’s. Pink and
crimson roses decked the Eastern lounge for the
feasting. Another party was given by Mrs. T. J.
Ryan, who is president of the standing committee
of the Women's College. The blue lounge of the
Bellevue saw the tea cups spread in the warmth of
a big fire. Poinsettias also burned, and gum tips
and pink carnations, which came from Sydney, did
their part. Mrs. Ryan, in cream with white fox
furs, made a pretty little speech to the guest of
honor and handed her a posy of violets. Mrs.
William Lennon, in black and squirrel furs, also
got violets.
The Troubadors had a good week in the Theatre
Royal; they now go up north under E. J. Carroll.
R. D. Crombie, son of the Andrew Crombies, took
Joyce, the youngest daughter of the late Lockwood
Graham, into his keeping in St. James's, Toowoomba.
Narcissi decorated the kirk, and the bride was in
rose-pink jersey cloth with black lint, carrying pink
sweat-peas. Ruth Pascoe, in delphinium blue,
’maided. The bride’s mother in black, with a
squirrel fur coat, had a small reception, and the
Northern Rivers sees the honeymoon.

One Thousand
Beautiful Things
chosen from the life and literature of the world
BY
ARTHUR MEE
We recommend this wonderful Book to every
reader, young or old. Three hundred and twenty
pages full of the rare and beautiful.
It is probably true that nothing we know stirs the heart and kindles
the mind as the sight or the thought of a beautiful thing.
Everywhere around us beauty lies, spreading itself about the earth,
working its way into human life, sinking for ever into the hearts of
men. All through the year, all round the world, all down the
ages we find it. Oft we have travelled in this realm of gold. Some
of us have been travelling through it ten years, twenty years, fifty
years, and the further we go, the older we grow, the more beautiful
is life’s garden. Here in these pages are some of its fruits.
That is why we recommend the old and young to
buy and read ARTHUR MEE’S One Thousand
Beautiful Things.

Geelong went to the dogs en masse last
week when the Waterloo Cup, most impor-
tant of the world’s coursing events, was run.
The carnival-week programme included only
one afternoon of horseiracing, but it was a
very nice afternoon of sunshine and shower.
There were nine races, but the Cup and the
Steeplechase dwarfed all else. The afternoon
tea-drinking was presided over by Racing
Club’s president R. Vincent and Mrs. Vin-
cent, her tailored suit a brown with brighten-
ing of leopard-skin. Their daughter Sammy
was smartly coated in cloth of dregs of
wine, fur-collared, * with felt top-piece.
Weather was too precarious to allow of
the billy being boiled out of doors, so cups
were clinked in the pavilion. Dressing was
mainly of the wintry order, being made up
of tailored costumes, topcoats, furs and
some raincoats. Raincoats this season are
charmingly colored in varied shot effects,
and their wearers look far from dowdy. The
Leslie Sprague couple, of Bream Creek, were
there, she wrapped in sealskin and skunk-
fur, with tricorne millinery; accompanying
them were daughter Audrey and Edith Cooke
aiid Margaret Cumming. Mrs. George Rus-
sell’s all-black turnout was cheered with
silver-fox furs. The Ramsay Cooks, Mrs.
B. L. Hickie and Captain and Mrs. E. R.
Stewart, of Queenscliff, w-ere other patrons.
Guests of Senator F. Guthrie and his
wife at Morongo for the carnival week were
Captain T. Parkin, of Kingston; R. C.
Guthrie, of Warrawidgee; John Chirnside,
W. E. Kewney, Colin Bell, Keith Tolhurst
and Lachlan Mackinnon.
On Thursday Geelong made acquaintance
with the vice-regal Somerses, who came to
see the running of the first ties of the Water-
loo Cup and take a sup and bite with presi-
dent Guthrie, the officials of the V.C.C.,
their womenfolk and a few others. Fine
weather out a big crowd. Ilis Ex.,
Lady Somers and party were shown how the
wheels went round, joining for a space the red-
coated slipper as he let loose the fleet-footed
hounds. Feminine patrons, forgetful of the
origin of the furs they wore, murmured a
hope that bunny would make his escape.
Lady Somers wore beneath a red leather
coat a fawn suit, with which her felt hat
blended. Private-secretary Davidson was in
attendance.
The enclosure on the grandstand sheltered,
iii addition to the vice-regal party, Senator
and Mrs. Guthrie, the lady’s frock and hat
of burgundy hue being worn with a
biscuit-hued coat. Mayor Thear, of Geelong,
and his wife, H. A. Anderson and Mrs.
Anderson, she in grey tweed with nigger vel-
our hat. Councillor and Mrs. J. Solomon and
Minister of Forestry Richardson and Mrs.
Richardson were also among the favored. At
the luncheon there were no speeches, and
only one toast —“The King.” On the lawn
’tween races were Mrs. James Robertson, a
golf enthusiast, of Barwon Heads; Mrs. V.
McColough and her pretty daughter Erma;
H. C. French, who guides the Ford industry
in Aussie, and Mrs. French ; the Harris
couple, from Beauford; Sheila Mclntyre, of
Mountside; the Esmond Shiels, and a num-
ber of bonnie lassies from the capital—
Lavender Stuart, Alison Moule, Chick Dick-
enson ; Phyllis Holmes Hunt, wearing a
squirrel coat with green velvet tam; and
Joan Newbigin.
A tripping at St. Mary’s Hall that even-
ing added to the Geelong Kindergarten funds,
and attracted a regular crush of dancers'
Balloons and wattle gave the ballroom a reck-
less air. Eileen Hurst and K. McKewan
and ,T. Hawkes did the secretarying.
Caulfield claimed the attention of the
Crown on Saturday, the Somers pair having
in their company Admiral Napier, Mrs.
Beau Fairbairn. the inevitable Davidson
couple and an aide or two. The Vice-reine
wore a leather coat over her tweed tailored
suit, and a small felt hat. Mrs. Davidson
also favored a smart coat and skirt, worn
with pastel-toned-velour millinery. The after-
noon, though spiced with midwinter’s chill,
was beautifully sunny, and tempted forth
most of the very nicest people. Well-cut
topcoats were the chief ingredients in the
fashion parade, with short-coated tailored
suits a good second in popularity. Of two
just-returned, Mrs. James Grice wore black,
with grey fox collar and cuffs and black
hat; and May Baillieu combined with a
tall felt hat a coat and skirt of fawn tones.
Clmstleton, Toorak, the new rendezvous of
smart society, was chosen for the English-
Speaking Union’s reception of the Governor
and Lady Somers. The party was framed
in pink heath and peach-blossom, and the
strains of jazz fell upon the ear. Mrs.
Donald Mackinnon handed the posy of wel-
come to her Ex., whose simple georgette frock
Ol geranium-red was ioil for a long chain of
diamonds. yice-president D. G. Lumsden
said nice things to the Governor, who in
reply, with an air that was childlike and
bland, congratulated the E.S.U. upon doing
its w’ork so well that the streets of the
city were thronged with American cars.
Among Englisli-speakers in evidence were
Professor Osborne and his wife, Dr. Ethel
Osborne; Mrs. Lumsden, a harmony in sil-
ver and blue lamd, and Harold Clapp, with
his vivacious partner in a crimson shawl.
Mrs. James Purves had an effective frock
of lobelia-blue, picked out in silver; Mrs.
John Fisken wore wistaria mauve apparel
scattered with gold and rose beads. The
E.S.U. secretary, Richard Ginns, and his
wife kept things moving happily. Author
Leonard Merrick and his daughter Lesley
were present as overseas members.
When the Alliance Franqaise held its ball
at .Carlyon’s the other evening, the modern
maiden discovered that the present-day skirt
is not suited for the sweeping curtsies of the
old-time cotillon. A version of the stately
dance was put on as an extra attraction, led
off by Mrs. Jimmy Dyer (president) and
baritone Clive Carey (Adelaide). Dainty
favors tied with the tricolor were provided
by the president, who was in an early-Vic
torian mauve gown with bertlie of old lace.
Margaret Chalmers (Sydney) had gold
strappings on a filmy white gown ; Chali-
apin’s daughter Stella was in soft draperies
of lime tone; and Lesley Merrick wore
gold radium lace over dull green. Chaliapin
and Madame were tnere, she in sparkling
raiment of white crspe de Chine. The
stage was all set for a grand entrance of the
Consul for France, M. Marcel Bourguin, wit'
brother Consuls, to the strains of the Mar
seillaise; but the tardy arrival of the lead
ing light upset these plans. The secretary
Pierre Herry, who left next day for a trip
to Noumea, was present with his two sisters
Eulalie and Yvonne.
The Naval and Military Club had an uu
expected windfall last week when no fewer
than 70 of Arthur Strecton’s war sketches
fell into its lap, all the gift of the artist. The
club, though its gets the lion’s share, is not
the only recipient of such favors. The
Prahran R.S.L., the Yorick, Savage, Lyceum
and Athenaeum clubs, the National Galleries
of Melbourne and Sydney, and various gen-
erals and colonels of the A.I.F. have been
remembered. The pictures were shown at
the Fine Arts Gallery lately, and moved
Diggers and brass-hats to fight their battles
over again.
The entertainments committee of the
Alfred Hospital felt on Friday that some-
thing attempted, something done had earned
a night’s repose, the deed being the amass-
ing of a level r 509 by a bridge party and
dance at the Wattle Tearooms. Mrs. A. T.
Ham handed over her picturesque establish-
ment and provided food and drink, and her
staff added no overtime to the paysheet. The
Wang Wang orchestra also did its bit for
the cause.
The other day members of the Art Circle
of the Lyceum Club learned something about
the chief
painters of
Russia, past
and present,
and were also
shown some
specimens of
Russian enam-
elling and em-
broidery. The
subject wa -s
handled by
Mrs. Mortill,
whose reflec-
ti o n in a
Pegg Clarke
camera faces
you alongside
this. She is a
Russian by
birth, and
married in the
first instance
an Australian
who was killed
in the Big War. Later she became the wife
of W. Mortill, whose home overlooks the
Yarra at Hawthorn. The vivacious lady
was a student of the Arts and Cjrafts School
of Moscow, but she loves music, too, and
pursued it when she could.
The Lyceum Club caught Chaliapin with a
cup of coffee. Though a prey to toothache,
the Russian giant, shepherded by the Charlie
Tait couple and manager Kingston, worked
up a smile for a mostly-fenunine gathering,
lie had a kindly word for the fiddling of
Gertrude Ilealy, the piano-playing of Sirs.
Spry, and the charm of uarrie Haase’s
accents; she spoke “Brian of Brittany.”
President Mrs. J. G. Latham, whose black
tulle gleamed with oxidised sequins, did her
best to express how overnowered the Club
felt. Chaliapin replied in English, a tricky
language, and he had to oe very careful.
Of course he enlarged on how dearly he
would love to reveal himself to Australians
in grand-opera rOles.
At His Majesty’s, on Saturday night.
Princess Ida brought in the last fortnight of
the Gilbert and Sullivan season. Strella Wil-
son, in her robes of white brocade, glistening
diadem and other twinklings, was a dig lificd
Princess whose red-gold locks flowed un-
trammelled. The ladies made a dashing pic-
ture in the third act in their suits of armor
beneath which peeped skirts of sapphire vel-
vet. Their leader figured in gold mesh of
mail upon a cream gown, and white plumes
waved upon her golden helmet. There was
much applause for producer Minnie Everett,
and a lot of pretty flowers passed over the
footlights.
The Firm’s latest musical comedy, “Tell
Me More,” filled the Theatre Royal on Satur-
day night. The dressing is quite elaborate.
The first act introduces Gus Bluett in the
feathered millinery, frills and satin of
Charles II.; Floie Allan as a pink Dresden
shepherdess; and Margery Hicklin as a
Columbine, in blue and silver, with pierrots
and pierrettes galore. In the following scene,
a New York hat-and-gown shop, tne color
scheme of the chorus is fawn with blendings
of wallflower tones. Then there is a ballet
in sweet-pea pink and mauve, topped by
toque-like headpieces of lime crin. with a
rose above each ear. Floie Allan capers in
front in a suit and hat of almond-green.
Ideas for early summer f rocking fire inspired
later on by filmy gowns worn with decorative
short coats. The two elder daughters of
Chaliapin were in the big crowd.
One of the many products Geelong is
proud of is the not only locally-raised but
also locally-
trained sculp-
to r Wallace
Anderson, who,
with official
w a r - corres-
pond e n t
Charlie Bean,
developed the
idea of equip
ping the Com-
m o n w e alth
War Museum
with models of
the chief
scenes in the
battles of the
A.I.F. H e
knew a bit
about it him-
self —was w’ith
the 23rd Bat-
tal-ion in
France, an d
after the war
became a Museum officer. With the late
Web Gilbert, he was commissioned to make
the miniature figures for the battle reproduc-
tions. To better qualify him for the job,
he grabbed a chance while abroad to brush up
bis knowledge with Hartwell, A.R.A. An
interesting group he is now modelling is a
trio of figures symbolising the Landing,
Occupation and Evacuation of Gallipoli.
The strings of the Kendall Quartette
sighed their last at the Assembly Hall on
an afternoon when the talented Katherine
and her associates played Haydn, Beethoven
and Dohnanyi quartettes. These artists
always wear gowns of contrasting hues, hut
their mastery of harmony is’ shown in this
as in other things. For their last appear-
ance the leader wore sapphire chiffon velvet,
Dorothy Brook was in purple, Dorothy Jones
had a frock of saxe blue, and ’cellist Edith
Hanson was a study in Veronese red. Mel-
bourne said good-bye with a rare collection
of beautiful flowers.
Enid Margaret, youngest daughter of the
Peates ; of East Camberwell, received a plain
gold ring from Fredric Strickland Dunn, of
Grancourt, Ringwood, at St. John’s, Cam-
berwell, on a recent evening in a choral
atmosphere, amidst billows of flowers. The
bride’s gown, of Limerick lace over white
georgette, was confined with a silver girdle;
the long lace train, trimmed with orange
blossom, showed a faint pink blush; and a
veil of Limerick was held in place with a
twist of silver tissue, tied over one ear with
a knot of orange blossoms. The two atten-
dants, Mollie Emmerson and Florrie Day.
were a froth of pink georgette, and bands
of tulle confined their hair and floated away
with fairy-like effect.
Herbert Austin, elder son of the Austins,
of Fernshore, and Sheila, daughter of the
A. C. Mercers, of Springwood, are receiving
congratulations from Western district folk.
Jack Baillieu’s wife, who returned this
week from visiting her sister, Mrs. Pat
Osborne, brought back a satisfactory morsel
of family news. Paddy, the eldest son of
the Harry Osbornes, and “Dar,” one of
Granville Ryrie’s twin daughters, have ex-
changed an engagement promise.
After a schooling abroad, Mary, the only
chick of the Stuart Murrays, was plunged
into the whirl of local society at a special
jazz given by her parents at No. 9. Holly-
hocks, roses and peach-blossm and irises fig-
ured in the decorations. The hostess’s sheath
of scintillating black sequins set off a stream-
ered bow of sapphire-blue velvet, and the
debutante, who held a sheaf of pink blos-
somry, was softly clad in white ninon deeply
flounced with a wreath in blue and pink
encircling her fair shingled locks. Captain
A. M. Treacy and Mrs. Treacy, she with
sweet-pea toned bead embroideries upon a
blue frock, lent a hand. Also present:
the Governor's secretary, Colonel Davidson,
and his wife; aide Brinkman; Lady Has-
tings ; Mrs. Stan Bruce, wearing black geor-
gette with jet and silver sequins; Dr. and
Mrs. Val MacDonalD Mrs. Russell Lan-
dale, a glitter in gold lace and lame, and lots
of pretty girls in beaded raiment and puf-
fings of taffeta.
One of those who curtsied at the first
drawing-room of the London season was
Linda Byron Moore, whose Titian locks har-
monised with a gown of leaf-green hue,
prinked up with silver embroidery and trail-
ing a train of silver lame. Dame Caroline
Bridgeman presented her.
Captain Napoleon Brinckman, the slim,
dark youth brought by the Somers pair,
lias fallen amongst friends. Clement Val-
lange, who when in Australia married Sylvia
Madden, served under his father, and has
interested a big clan in the son. The young
man was born at St. Helena, hence the
romantic name.
To enable Meynell Withers, a promising
young painter, to go abroad to study, per-
mission has been given his mother to run
an art union, the prizes of which include
some of the young man’s own works and a
number of fine paintings by Walter Withers,
, his dead father. The prizes are on view at
Collins Court. Art runs strongly in the
Withers family. Marjorie, a teacher at
Swinburne Technical College, uses a brush
cleverly, and an English cousin is scenic
artist at the Garrick.
The Opportunity Shop set up to help St.
Vincent’s Hospital revealed that there is
a lot of money in trafficking in second-hand
wares. Last week a second edition of the
establishment was opened on the same pre-
mises, in the old Cyclorama, for the benefit
of the Children’s Hospital, and the week’s
takings ran to £2OO. The Sisters of Charity
of St. Vincent’s Hospital helped the sister
institution by lending the building.
Sister Adelaide’s postscript:—
The Bridges and their daughter were at the Hunt
Ciub meeting at Cheltenham, where Andrew Tennant
annexed the Drag Cup and A. A. West the Bracelet.
It was largely a tailored meeting, with tweed coats
and skirts or topcoats of long straight line account-
ing for half of the dressing. Mrs. F. W. Whyte,
whose husband is the Club’s president, being absent,
Mrs. George Braund acted as her proxy and hostessed
the committee’s tea.
From England comes news of the marriage of
Margaret Judge to Dr. Needham Marsh. The wedding
was at Liverpool and (he honeymoon rose over th<
English lakes. Her home is to be in Sheffield, where
her husband has bought a practice.
There have been wedding bells, too, at St. Peter's
College Chapel, the occasion the marriage of Joyce,
younger daughter of the G. H. Prossers, to Leslie,
son of the W. Maidens, of Dulwich. The bride was
all silver and white, with a green and gold brides-
maid, Estelle Edwards, and a small flower-girl in
blue and silver to attend her. In the evening there
was dancing at the Liberal Club Hall, with the
Prossers as hosts and pink peach-blossom tied with
blue as the feature of the decorations.
Members of the Alliance Frangaise staged their
annual masked ball at the Palais on France’s Day,
with favors for all the dancers and a programme
of specialty dancing as items of the evening. The
Frank Mouldens headed the organising committee,
with Mrs. li. H. Weston as secretary.
Percy Grainger has given us the thrill of the
week. His concerts have been interlarded with a
picking up of the threads of old acquaintanceship
and a party or two. His aunt, Mrs. George Aldridge,
and his cousin, Mrs. J. H. Morish, have both given
teas in his honor, and at each the guests had the
luck to hear him play as well as meeting him.
Twenty hostesses combined to give a dance at
the Glenelg Palais, where guests included Lady
Bridges, with Captain Brooke in attendance, the
Wallace Bruces and a sprinkling of the older gener-
ation as well as a big muster of the younger dancing
set. On the supper tables old-fashioned “Aunt
Eliza” came into her decorative own, with poppies
and jonquils and sweet-peas set about her, and in the
ballroom ivy garlands hung from an almond-blossom
freize.
The City Council is going to give its 10U for
£300,000. North-terrace is to be remodelled,
garden borders in the past having- been encouraged
at the expense of traffic space. The main bridge
over the Torrens, half a century old, is to be
rebuilt or widened: and the Town Hall is to be
made to grow.
It looks as if the Shrine of Memory planned by
the R. S. and S. League will get in ahead of the long-
talked-of official War Memorial. There is a vague
proposal to give the Torrens its much-nec led new
bridge, and make an archway over it the State
memorial. Meanwhile the Diggers have got a definite
promise from the Gunn Government of a corner acre
of Government House garden for their Shrine, with
a hint that £25,000 can be had for the asking.

NOTIONS
Next to MeShortodds, who. had his usual
bag-filling day, the most gratified than at Canterbury
Park (N.S.W.) on Saturday was the handicapper,
who had the satisfaction of seeiiag flee of the 14
starters in the Canterbury Handicap, 11 furlongs,
fini-h almost abreast. Ayrwynnte- (8 ,to 1), a
useful St. Alwyne mare from Newcastle, got the
verdict by a head from Pennybctnt and Auction,
who , divided second place, and Bacchus was the
closest of fourths. J. ,1. Qarvan, now abroad, was
represented by a winner in North Logan (Biddlestone
Bangaroo), whose manner of beating a good field
of sprinters when obviously' a bit above himself,
and therefore unbacked—he closed at 25 to 1, offered
—suggests that other victories are in store for the
good-looking colt. Further successes may' likewise
be predicted for Valiant’s sister Attractive, who
led all the way in a two-year-old race, for which
she went out at 6 to 1, and came borne on the bit.
* * *
Punters had a liberal ‘ issue of trouble at
Caulfield (Vic.) on Saturday. It began with the
J-eamingon Hurdle, which Arroya ((33 to 1) won
easily' from The Governor (12 to 1) and Renown
(14 to 1).; arid all attempts to pick the jumping
double crashed when the Ta.sman ia i ivowned Grimaldi
(10 to 1) accounted for old Haomrt (7 to 2) and
Master Mariner (5 to 1) in the Godfrey Watson
Steeple. Also, Smoke Bomb (7 to 4), supposed to
be the bet of the day, proved no match for the
Green Seal —Bradford Lass horse Tmctile (12 to 1)
in the Murrumbeena Handicap, 11 flurlongs; Long-
worthy (8 to 1) was third. But. worse was to come,
for Bonify (20 to 1) fluked the first division of the
Kambrook Trial, Leon Gordon’s horse Tullius (7 to
2) being a good thing beaten, and Pcillymine (14 to
1) was successful in the second division. In between
Eric Connolly's good-looking Woorak —Simmerettc
colt Chiton (6 to 4) ran away with thte two-year-old
race, the stable getting most of the money; and
Bachelor’s pal (4 to 1). a read public fancy, took
the last race, the Malvina Welter, from the unlucky
Ouragan. But the public will, retain no pleasant
memories of the V.A.T.C.’s July- meeting, though it
wasn’t the club's or the weathgr-clerk’s fault.
“Hasen” : An excellent argument for the
totalisator again showed up at the Grand National
meeting. This, as are all big meetings, was 1 harvest-
time for the short-odds merchant, the type of book
that tries you with “5 to 1” about an outsider, and
howls “Sixes! Eights! Tens!” as you turp away',
lie was much in evidence and had a royal time, as
he must on all crowded days,, when the more repu-
table men are so surrounded as to be all but in-
accessible, except to the big punter who can nod a
book-bet from a distance or the hardy enthusiast
who doesn’t mind mixing in a wild scrum. Race
after race these sharks called anything from 10
points under the odds for a longer-priced horse to one
or two points under for a favorite, with the reason-
able quotes being shouted well within hearing dis-
tance, but out of reach. And the worst of it was
they were assured of fat books, at these highway-
robbery prices, from casual, racegoers who flock to the
annuals and know no better, and from numbers of
regulars who knew they were being robbed but could
not fight their way in to- the men calling fair odds.
The tote may have its disadvantages, but it doesn t
turn plain thief when opportunity offers.
“Hotham”: The quaint convention that
writers on racing should affect a military pen-name
still lingers in England, even with journals that
pride themselves on their modernity. The custom
never seems to have caught on in this country,
though military prefixes were as leaves in V allony
brosa in the volunteer days when “Colonel Jaw-
bone Neild was consul. The practice is probably
a survival of the early Victorian tradition that
army officers were terrible fellows, given greatly
to gambling, hunting, racing and other amuse-
ments on which the Lower Middle Qlass looked
askance. Sturtees hits this mental attitude off neatly
in “Soapy Sponge”; when a witness before the
stewards of a hunt steeplechase meeting is asked
what he means by a “military gent,” he says a
man who keeps a box of cigars and a; bottle of port
on his dressing-table.” So, in England, a great
daily is glad to publish that its “Captain Bunk
picked five winners yesterday. Here, the same task
—or vice versa —is performed by “Eagle Eye,
“Stickybeak,” “The Urger” or some similarly un-
convincing person.
“Bris.” : “In view of recent happenings, ’
as officialdom expresses it, an addition has been made
to the Queensland totalisator regulations. After the
Welter at Ascot on Brisbane Cup day, a prominent
member of the State Labor party weighed in with
a £5 ticket on an also-ran. He ; declared that
the tote attendant had given him the> wrong ticket;
he had asked for £5 worth of briefs on the winner,
a rank outsider. Had anyone else made the claim
he would have been laughed at, but this was a
Labor member, a high official of the party, who is
liable to become a Minister any day; so the tote
paid him £5O. Truth and its associated papers
made such a noise over the incident that the Depart-
ment of Justice has now forbidden thd tote to pay
out on worthless tickets, even when presented by
Labor politicians.

Terminus to win a Waterloo Cup is an investment
that rarely pans out badly. Last week at Geelong
he took the big Victorian event from 70 opponents
—his second Waterloo this season and third in suc-
cession. He opened at 20 to 1, and though his
owhers piled the money on, 16’s was still available
when they closed, after supporting him to win
£4OOO. The same owners’ Ezic also started.
She went out in the second ties, precisely where
Terminus (outworked after leading a ship-length)
went down the previous year. That year Ezic won.

Wrestling took the place of boxing at the
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night. One of the
contestants was the veteran Zbyszko, who, though
called a Pole, is more like a concrete pier of the
North Shore bridge; his opponent, Sam Clapham, is
said to be champion of England. Zbyszko, who was
about three stone heavier than Sammy, though much
the older man, won the first fall by means of a
toehold in the fourth round, and gained another —
and the verdict—in the seventh bout, Sammy having
in the meantime got in a “flying mare” and dumped
the mountain of meat with the sodawater name.
A few clouts with a large hairy fist contributed,
as he fancied, surreptitiously by Clapham added to
the small crowd's interest in the encounter, which
was certainly vigorous; but it is doubtful if the
game can be revived in Sydney.
In an energetic exhibition of limb-twisting
at the Melbourne Stadium, Mike Yokel defeated
Martin Ludecke by two falls to one. The first fall
came in the third round, when the Yank picked
Martin up for what he calk his “aeroplane spin.”
Something went wrong with the “aeroplane spin,”
and, finding himself on top of the spinner, Ludecke
pinned him with a body press and arm scissors.
In round five Yokel went to the mat unassisted and
invited the Swiss down; but instead of accepting
Martin turned to the referee as if to protest.
Michael immediately dived for the legs, and, tucking
one under each wing in a reverse double-leg hold,
sat back. The strain was too much for the Swiss,
who capitulated with alacrity. Feigning a leg
injury in the seventh round, the Yank again went
to the mat. Scenting victory, Ludecke rushed in,
only to be gathered up in a body press and downed.
Each weighed 12st. 121 b.
History of a new kind was made in the
third Test match when Macaulay (76) and Geary
(35 n. 0.) pulled England out of the mire by adding
108 runs for the ninth wicket. The contempt shown
by the pair for the Australian bowling suggests that
the “rabbitness” of England’s end batsmen has been
over-stressed. It was certainly in glaring evidence
in Australia in 1924-25, but it may have been partly
due to the fact that the worst failure with the bat
was the captain, Gilligan, who always set the tail
a disheartening example in the big games instead of
an encouraging one. And it was brought into
stronger relief by the fine performances of Australia’s
hindmost batsmen, Oldfield ,and Mailey, although the
latter has been utterly unable to reproduce his bat-
ting form in England this, trip and the wicket-
keeper has suffered a declension, too. Certainly the
bowling which Macaulay and Geary defied was
hardly of the quality which made the latter half
of several English innings in Australia a mere pro-
cession pavilionwards, but they defied it very confi-
dently for alleged “rabbits.” Since then the statis-
ticians have discovered that Macaulay shouldn’t have
been assessed so cheaply, seeing that he once made
a century in a county match. Nevertheless, one
Australian paper argued that he must be a very poor
bat, or he wouldn’t have been put in below Tate.
It might be worth recalling that Tate once made
203 for Sussex against Northamptonshire.
After Macaulay and Geary had made their un-
expected stand and the English total had been brought
to 294, only 200 behind Australia’s, it was obvious
that it only required another of Hobbs’s and Sut-
cliffe’s famous partnerships to place their side in an
absolutely safe position. The pair supplied it,
making, 88 and 94 respectively, and not being sepa-
rated until 156 was on the board. After both had
gone, Woolley was dismissed for 20, but Chapman
arrived to clout the bowling merrily in the last half-
hour. He made 42 ; Hendren was the other not out
with 4. Result: England vyith 7 wickets to fall were
54 on, and a match where Australia looked to have
an excellent chance of winning for most of the first
two days ended in another draw. With a single
bowler of (say) Kelleway’s stamp, the result might—
and probably would —have been different, but there is
no use in crying over spilt milk now. The selec-
tors took grave risks with the bowling, but they could
hardly suspect that Gregory was a spent force and
they certainly couldn’t foresee Hendry’s illness. The
llth-hour choice of Everett was a gamble that didn’t
come off. The bright spot on this occasion was
Grimmett; he took 5 for 88 in the first innings and
2 for 59 in the second. These are fine figures for
a slow bowler; Hobbs, Sutcliffe and Woolley all fell
to him once.
The English team will sustain a couple of altera-
tions for the fourth Test at Manchester. Geary and
Macaulay are dropped, the fact that they got Eng-
land out of a tight place by their batting being out-
weighed by the consideration that they entirely failed
to put Australia into one by their bowling. The
decision is logical, in so far that if the pair had gor
the wickets they were expected to get there would
have been no need for them to make the runs they
weren’t expected to make. Stevens, the 25-year-old
M iddlesex: all-rounder, will displace one of them
and Root/(or Parker) the other. E. Tyldesley, the
pride of Lancashire, is down as twelfth man. The
Australian team will probably be the same, unless
Ponsford is brought in vice Taylor, who owes it to
his fielding that he hasn’t been dropped sooner.
Hendry’s convalescence is slow, and it is hinted that
he may not be available at all for the rest of the
tour. Collins has recovered sufficiently to go to
Sandown for an afternoon’s racing; in his absence
there has been some criticism of Bardsley’s cap-
taincy. Gregory, it is obvious, should have a com-
plete rest from the bowling creases, and Macartney
has been bowled a great deal too much in minor
matches for a man so precious to the side.
Considering Lancashire’s always high place in
county tables —though it is over 20 years since it
was right at the top—it made a poor show in its
second match with the tourists (only two other
counties get a second game nowadays). Australia
batted. first at Liverpool and put up 468 for 6
wickets, of which Macdonald took 5 (Bardsley 155,
Andrews 95, Woodfull 65, Ponsford 50). The best
the county could do in reply Was 204 and 274 for
9 wickets. Obviously the clock did most to save it
from a crushing defeat, but Makepeace (70) and
Hallows (39) gave the side a good start in the first
innings, and repeated it in the second with 76 and
48 respectively. The onlv other batsman to glimmer
was Idddn- with 57. Mailey took 8 wickets for 68
in the first innings and Andrews 6 for 109 in the
second. By no means the least notable feature of
the game was Ellis’s wicket-keeping; he stumped
four men and caught three.
The two-days’ match against the West of Scotland
was the first of the two holiday fixtures over the
border that precede the fourth Test. After dis-
missing the opposition for 163, Australia declared
with 6 wickets down for 368 (Ponsford 109,
Macartney 106) and mowed down the Scots in their
second venture for 146.
“S.T.S.”: One of the shrewdest lawyers I know
has a Test-match wager which looks nicer every
week that passes. It is simply that Australia will
not win a single game of the present series, about
which wild idea—as it seemed last March—he -rot
sto 1. His reasoning is that we lack the bowling
talent to get out Hobbs, Sutcliffe and the rest
cheaply enough ; but that anyway our strength is in
high scoring, and thus any matches we should win
will not be finished. This theory, if correct, makes
the wager depend,' on the final match, which is to
be played out; and leaves the layer of the odds in
the curious position of having laid 5 to 1 on Aus-
tralia for that game.
“H.M.”: The axe which for months had
been threatening certain delegates to the N.S.W.
Cricket Association fell last week, when the Gordon
club rejected Syd, Smith, manager of the Australian
XVI, and Glebe turned down Neil Blue. Repre-
sentatives of other clubs did not seek nomination.
The reverse was a serious matter for Smith, who
can’t hold his position as secretary of the Board of
Control unless he is an Association delegate, but a
representative of the Junior Union promptly retired
in his favor, so all is well until he returns. Gordon’s
choice of another delegate is taken to be an expres-
sion of its dissatisfaction at the exclusion of Kelle-
way; but the club protests that it made the change
because it wanted more energetic representation, and
that Smith got a fair deal.

“Retired Volt” : Tlie cableman lids put up
some performances of merit in bringing overseas spoil-
ing news to Australia’s breakfast table. A few years
ago two or three hours was considered good going
from London to Melbourne. By contrast, the result
of the recent Epsom Derby reached Melbourne in
45 seconds. Certainly in that race the winning horse
was well ahead of the pack, and the information that
it had won was somewhere off the West African
coast before a lot of the drenched punters on the
course knew it; but even so it was a commendable
achievement, seeing that the telegram had to pass
through 12 stations before reaching these shores.
Nothing as fast as this has been done with the
cricket press, which is composed of fairly long
messages, but average times of 15 minutes have been
frequent. Getting a message through at such a
pace postulates immense enthusiasm in the human
participants. Merely mechanical efficiency wouldn t
do it. Fortunately, Australia’s interest in Macartney’s
batting is shared by the lonely watchers at Ascension.
St. Helena, Cocos and all the other links in the
long chain.

Shaken well together by two previous
matches, the All Blacks vanquished N. S. Wales by
11 points to 6 in the second Rugby Union Test on
the Sydney Show Ground. Having discovered that
the N.'S.W. backs were a bit too smart for them, the
visitors plaved a spoiling game for all it -was
worth. The forwards, badly beaten for possession in
the scrums last week, this • time left nothing to
chance. They used their great superiority in weight
to shove the opposition off the ball, and, on the
few occasions when N.S.W. hooked it, wheeled and
broke the scrum at once. It was not surprising, then,
that the N.S.W 7 . back division cracked up. Sheehan,
■who was a champion at five-eighth in the first
game, went to bits under the stress of the attack.
The selectors erred in omitting Towers and putting
Morrissey in his place at centre. The old St.
Ig.’s crack played a duffing game, and neither he
nor Sheehan seemed able to hold a pass. There was
no fault to be found with Meagher behind the
scrum, and Crossman again played good footer on
the left wing, but Reg Foote hardly filled the place
of the injured Bowers. Ross, at full-back, was again
a great success, and he had a rather busy day of it.
Of the forwards, it must be said that they carried
the side on their shoulders. Save in the matter of
weight in the pack, they were the superiors of
their famous adversaries- —and that is a big word.
Some of the Maoriland players disappointed even
more than the Welshmen named. Their forwards
got the ball out to the backs, but the famous Mills-
Nicholls-Cook combination failed to sparkle. Blake;
the .Maori centre-three., was a weak link in the
chain, and gave an astonishingly inept exhibition
for a player of his reputation. Elver was again
brilliant on the wing, scoring a beautiful try, and
Svenson, the 1924 All Black star, was almost as
good on the other side. Stevenson, making his first
Australian appearance at full-back, was a solid
tackier. The forwards were again the typical con-
certed M.L. vanguard, though they lack pace. Fin-
lay.son and Irvine were prominent, while wingv
forward and skipper Porter was onside several times
during the play. - One of the forwards, at least, has
a careless way of swinging his hands about.
M.L. won the third game, and the rubber.
With their usual last-minute rush to get
among “the four,” several Vic. League teams arc
now doing a great dash, mostly with poor results.
On Saturday South Melbourne, by outing Richmond,
drew level for sixth place. It has a possible, and so
has Essendon, but the three-placed teams of last season
—Geelong, Collingwood and Melbourne —will probably
fill the “shops” this year, with Carlton following,
South took things easily with Richmond till the
last quarter, when it simply galloped over the Tigers
and won by XOB points to 75, Essendon collected
50 points to North Melbourne’s 32, which was nothing
jto rave about; and Carlton’s total of 65 points
to Hawthorn’s 53 • put no halo round its brow.
Geelong achieved a convincing victory over Footscray,
107 to 56; and ’Wood had another good win at
’Roy’s expense*—'Wood, 124 points; ’Roy, 82. Alsp
■Melbourne amassed 118 points against St. Kilda’s 29,
•which raised its “points” percentage, but did little else.
THE GENTLE GOLFER.
[For The Bulletin.]
“A caddie charged with using profane language at
Kendal (England) blamed the bad example set
By his golfing employers. ‘You should hear them
when they' miss a ball,’ he told the magistrate.’
M.F.H.’s once were reckoned unto no blasphemers
second
(O the bursts of lurid language in the days when
Surtees wrote !).
Mates on boats that carry cattle off their fertile
lips can rattle
Fearsome strings of imprecations quite impossible
to quote.
Thames bargees and navvies’ gangers are redoubtable
haranguers
In the argot of the alley's and the clinks,
But the chaps who own no masters in the realm of
damn-and-blasters
Are the ones who meet disasters on the links.
When y'ou’ve sliced or failed to loft one, though the
stroke appeared a soft one
(O the hellishness of bunkers and the smooth
deceit of greens !)
Will a mere “Tut-tut!” bring healing to the
wounded pride you’re feeling,
Or a “Bless my soul!” convey the paralysing
shock it means?
Is a simple “S’truth!” or “Blime!” fitting comment
on a stymie
Or a three-foot putt upon the hole that brinks?
The expressions you can rise to —ay'e, and put the
caddies wise to—
No one knows until he tries to —on the links.
Hear that devastating, tearing storm of plain and
fancy swearing
(O the coster’s adjurations! O the ox-persuader’s
spells !),
Oaths that no conventions shackle, adjectives that
hiss and crackle,
Nouns that send your fancy skallyhooting back
to bursting shells,
Gypsy Smith might fall a-weeping at profanity s-o
sweeping,
Worse than anything he ever heard, methinks.
He would class it a$ abhorrent. But- the Devil
grins, I warrant,
At the comminat’ry torrent from the links.

THE INKY WAY.
Joseph Anderson, who died in Bendigo
the other day at SO, joined the local Adver-
tiser ir. 1856 and was in charge of the
machine-room for the best part of his 53
years’ service. He retired in ’O9.
The Weekly Courier. Launceston (Tas.L
was 25 on July 7. The only original mem-
ber of the staff is Miss K. Farrell, the
social editress, who hasn’t missed a Laun-
ceston Cup meeting, agricultural show or
any other gathering of local importance
since the infant was born.
J. S. Nicholls, just made super, of the
Government Printing Office at Singapore,
started picking up .type at Kapunda
(S.A.) on the Herald •; later he was over-
seer on the Silver Age at Broken Hill while
it lasted, and then at Perth on the Daily
News. But he crossed over to Asia some
time ago.
“Uloola”: Like the Manly Daily" (B.
8/7/’26), the Hurstville (N.S.W.) Pbo-
j’ELLER lias developed from a given-away
advertising sheet into a thriving suburban
weekly'. Run by an old S. M. Herald man,
A. H. Wennholm —not from the literary staff
- -it began as a four-page collection of ads.
with local news items interspersed; now it
is an eight-page penny pa|per with a large
advertising clientele and an enviable local
vogue.
“George H.”: The suspension of news-
papers in England during the general strike
has had one interesting sequel. A photo-
radiogram of the British Gazette, the offi-
cial Government paper, was sent to New
York and reproduced, ancP was seen by mil-
lions of Americans before its circulation at
home was out of six figures. The newspaper
world is now talking of the- practicability of
publishing four-page editions of New York
dailies in London and of London dailies in
America, the sheets being photoradioed
across, brought up to a full size and printed
from photographic plates.
“Wang”: Like “Hamer,” I have met
apocryphal Bulletin contributors in plenty.
Many years ago in a tram an affable
stranger, tapping the red paper I had in
front of me, mentioned that; he was “Kodak.”
He talked plausibly enough, and I eagerly
listened in the hope of picking up some
useful hints, as I was then just, making a
start as a contributor myself, IVo described
in detail where he got his drunk, and board-
ing-house yarns, and I certainly gained some
insight into part of the curriculum while I
was in his company. When latter I did meet
“Kodak” I found lie had never—-up to then
—lived in a boarding-house or taken a spot.
A year or two ago I met myself, and the
chap who said he was me soon had me wish-
ing I was not such an unblushing liar. But
the bush is the place to meet V-m. I've
encountered four or five Rod Quintand Jim
Graliames, all alike in one resect —their
affection for beer.
“Country Fed.”: The Performiijg Rights
Association is doing good work in seeing that
the Writers and composers whose wc*'ks arc
snug, spoken and played before the* public
receive their just dues under the Cc|pyright
Act. It might extend iff* activities to the
scissors-and-paste bandits'of the press world.
In Britain, authors sell’: a publisher “first
serial rights.” Other publishers who wish
to lift such matter then find they hitfve to
pay “second serial rights,” and even 4 third
serial rights.” Here it seems that any
matter, so long as the first paper or maga-
zine does not proclaim that the publication
is copyright, can be relpublished so long as
Mr. Scissors merely indicates the origin
of his clipping. Notorious “lifters” are
Government and semi-Gtovernment publica-
tions, the editors of which, not being pro-
vided with funds, have fto beg, borrow or
otherwise procure copy to* fill their columns.
What about an Authors’ Rights Associa-
tion ?
“Seebee” : The, young burglar who bluffed
the sentry into the belief that he was an
.electrician, and escaped from the Melbourne
metropolitan gaol, Coburg, had much .better
luck than a well-known reporter who once
accompanied Premier Tom Bent and a Par-
liamentary party to Pentridge. The scribe
had managed to get Bent in a corn(|- and
extract from him a bit of politio»il informa-
tion that promised to be a scctop ftir the
afternoon paper. Thrilling over, nis achieve-
ment, he took the shortest cut to tju; main
gate and asked the warder on gufard to open
it. That person, however, refused to let
him pass until he was identified. Blandish-
ments, persuasions and profanity wqre alike
futile. Valuable moments were fpaslng* and
all the heads werts dancing atftmdmice on
Bent. At last the Parliamentary! party can*/
along, and there were 30 readjl to certify
regarding him. And, as the 1.-fG. couldn't
snap at him for doing his duty* the stolid
warder looked proud of himself while the
politicians bantered the pressmen (for “arous-
ing suspicion.”
A MERE NOTE OF EXCLAMATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘Rats,’ by Mark Hovell.” —Library catalogue.
The title glimpsed appeared to me
That terse and potent word,
The most contemptuously brief
Expression of his unbelief
That ever oaf preferred—
Tabloid contempt, scorn packed and weighed,
And refutation ready, made.
The sole equipment for debate
Of many a wrangling churl
Who lacks, like Browning’s duke, the skill
In speech to signify his will
And so can only hurl
This controversially slick
Equivalent of half a brick.
I pictured it some cynical
Miscellany of scoffs,
Epitome of sneer and flout
Within whose pages mocking doubt
The last restriction doffs.
But lo! it is not “Rats!” but “Rats.”
Pass it to Towser and the cats.

P 1 1904 "'l* l a oapital of £lO,OOO, was able to reconstruct in 1921 by the issue of a fully-
paid £1 share for every 5/- share previously held, its profits and progress being' phenomenal, and its
reserves in 1924 being almost equal to its capital of £215,448, on which a £56,141 profit was made
hi 1923-24.
CAPITAL AND FINANCE.
The issued capital of £150,000 will provide £lOO,OOO subscribed capital and a reserve of £50,000
uncalled capital. This will provide from £25,000 to £30,000 working capital, thus rendering the
Company financially self-contained, and will additionally provide adequate security for all monetary
advances to customers likely to be required.
MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES.
The Memorandum and Articles of Association are drawn to comply with the requirements of the
principal Stock Exchanges throughout Australia, to whom application will be made for the listing
of the shares of the Company in due course.
REFERENCE.
Reference concerning the Company may be made gratis to any of the Solicitors or Brokers
abovementioned, or to the offices of the Bank of Australasia in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide, and
the chief towns throughout New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and to any office of the Bank
of Australasia in Tasmania.
APPLICATIONS.
As the whole of the shares offered to the public have been already underwritten and shares are likely
to be at.a premium at an early date, early application is advised.
Applications for shares may be made to the Company, or any of its brokers above mentioned, or
through any member of a recognised Australian • Stock Exchange, to whom a brokerage of 1/- per share
will be paid on allotted applications lodged duly stamped.
Application and all other moueys payable on shares may be lodged at any office of the Bank of
Australasia throughout Australia for transmission to the Company free of exchange or other charges.
PROMOTERS’ CONSIDERATION.
There is no cash consideration payable to the promoters, who are taking the very unusual course
of accepting the modest issue of shares allocated them for important rights transferred and services
rendered, paid to 10/- per share only, thus evincing their confidence in the prospects of the Company.

A delicate atmosphere of musk and sweet
lavender was projected into the Sydney
Royal on Saturday night when the cycle of
Barrie plays started with “Quality Street,”
a dainty exposition of two things in par-
ticular —one, the social manners of a period
when the chief desire of the young lady who
is now a flapper was to be ladylike; the
other, Barrie’s whimsicalities. Valentine
Brown, who smokes a pipe and gives other
evidence of being a young blade, stirs the
bosoms of the household which consists of
Susan Throssel, resigned to the role of _ old
maid, and her sister, Phoebe “of the ring-
lets” ; but cheerfully blind to the havoc
he has done, he goes off to war without
making the expected “offer” to the younger
sister. She settles down to heart-break and
the school-teaching which the poverty-
stricken gentlewoman of the period esteemed
to be the one ladylike means of fighting the
wolf; and when, after Waterloo, Valentine
returns as a one-armed captain, she has
settled herself into the habits and costume of
a reconciled old maid. But rebellion comes
with his return; and, renewing her youth in
the guise of her own niece, she flirts boldly
in a determination to punish him for the
suffering he has caused. The discovery that,
instead of being dazzled by the flirtatious
niece, he is only driven by comparison to
realise his love for the sweet-natured Phoebe
of old, puts back the gold into her dreams,
and in a last act of delightful whimsicalities
complete happiness is restored.
The ladies were inclined to regard their
early lines as strict confidences; apart from
that the performance was excellent, reflect-
ing the very fine polish which Dion Bouci-
cault had put upon it. The burden—if such
a play can have a burden —fell on the shoul-
ders of three performers. The amazingly
long-legged Brian Aherne put sincerity into
his Valentine Brown, who mixes his dash
with the staid views of the period about
the behavior proper to females. Angela
Baddeley was alluring as Phcebe, and rose
well to the big scene between the fictitious
niece and Valentine Brown. But the per-
formance that will live most tenderly in
memory is that of Mary Jerrold as. Susan
Throssel, than whom no more charming old
maid has been presented on the Australian
stage in this Showman’s recollection. Mary
Macgregor, although she definitely declined
to let nine years make any difference in her
appearance, did well as Patty, the maid of
the house in Quality-street; young George
Devlin was surprising as Master Arthur
Wellesley Thomson, and another amongst
the well-drilled children in the schoolroom
scene would have a mention if his name had
been on the programme.
❖ $
“Rose Marie” continues to pile color on
Canadian landscape at Sydney Majesty’s,
where, smiling over the box-office returns,
the management is satisfied that the big
dress-bills were a good investment. There
is no sign either of Nanette growing tired
at the St. James. “Mrs. Cheyney” goes on
lasting at the Criterion, with no hint yet of
an early finish. “The Climax” is doing well
at tIT Palace; but the word is given that a
revival of “The Sentimental Bloke” is to
take place there on August 14, with Bert
Bailey as Ginger Mick, so a limited time
only is allowed in which to see popular Dot
Brunton. “Our Liz” holds the G.0.H.; but
E. J. Carroll’s “Best People” will arrive on
August 21. Ada Reeve is in Sydney with
an eye on the same house; but on present
indications she will have a long wait.
* -r * *
With no music and no curtain-rise to in-
dicate the commencement of the show, the
audience looks at an unset stage, crowded
with the usual behind-the-scenes Impedimen-
ta. A dusty-looking person comes on, pipe
in mouth, and potters with the footlights
while the persons concerned in the rehearsal
of “Mixing It Up” drift on, the stage-
manager making his entrance through the
auditorium and censuring the leading lady
for doing the same thing. In these gro-
tesque circumstances Pirandello’s “Six
Characters in Search of an Author,” staged
by the Repertory Society at the Sydney Con-
servatorium on Saturday, makes its opening.
The play really begins with the arrival of
six characters created by an author who has
abandoned his play before it was finished.
They demand an opportunity to live the life
for which they were created —at least two
of the characters want to go on, and the
rest, though reluctant, are compelled to fit
into their places. The author had good rea-
spn for abandoning the play, which is a hor-
rific story of a father and son who, before
they discover the relationship, both com-
promise themselves with the daughter of the
unfaithful wife the elder man drove from his
house years before. There is a grotesque
comparison between the comedy of the stage-
manager, who, as he becomes interested, be-
lieves he has discovered a play which will
draw big houses, and the earnestness of the
shadow characters —the father anxious for
the play to go on to show that not himself
but Fate is responsible, the step-daughter
angrily eager to show his responsibility. It
is an amazing conception.
* * * *
Gregan McMahon had the main responsi-
bility as the father in the unfinished play,
a part fitted with many speeches resembling
slabs taken from books on psycho-analysis;
he maintained the spirit of earnestness well.
Berkeley. Ayris provided a good foil as the
distracted but hopeful stage-manager, who
stood more than any s.-m. could be expected
to stand. Beatrice Day was the shamed
and horror-stricken mother amongst the
characters, and Daphne Deane, although in-
clined to be awkward in her gestures, put
poignancy into the portrayal of the daughter.
That artistic combination, the Kendall
String Quartette, has passed on from Mel-
bourne to Sydney, and is drawing lovers of
ensemble work to the Adyar Hall. The four
young Englishwomen opened their season
on Saturday night with Beethoven’s string
quartette in B flat. They at once caught the
attention with the fine sensitiveness of their
group playing. Their craft is above re-
proach, and they play with a perfection of
balance that comes from six years’ associa-
tion. Dvorak’s Quartette in F was both
stimulating and graceful. Schubert, Ravel
and Haydn were the composers on Monday
night’s programme, and of them the spark-
ling and melodic work of Haydn raised the
audience to the warmest appreciation.
Backhaus was in titanic mood at the
Sydney Town Hall on Saturday night. Open-
ing with the dazzling Brahms Ballade in G
Minor, he went on to that tremendous ex-
pression of Beethoven, the Sonata in C
Minor. Through the second movement he
wove his way, and gave his work the sim-
plicity and sincerity that come from great
understanding. In this movement the com-
poser seems to have caught not only the sing-
ing of the stars, but the singing of the
spheres. Scriabine’s Satanic Poem and his
Fourth Sonata in F Sharp Major were of
stirring interest, and Chopin and Rachman-
inoff added beauty to the night. The final
fireworks was that Charleston of the key-
board, Liszt’s Second Hungarian Rhapsody,
of which a great critic has written that its
only excuse is Backhaus.
CHALIAPIN SINGS ABOUT A FLEA.
The education of the public to the value
of its timber wealth is being pushed for-
ward belatedly. On Monday a private
screening was given of “Forest- Wealth,
a picture produced under the auspices of the
N.S.W. Forestry Department to show what
is being -done to compensate for the care-
lessness and follies of past generations. The
photography is excellent; and the close-ups
of wild animal and bird life are monuments
of patience as well as art. Apart from that
and the scenic appeal, the figures given,
although the picture is by no means over-
weighted with them, are arresting. Waste
reduced N.S.W. forest areas from 31,000,000
to 11,000,000 acres before steps were taken
to check the destruction; and the tree de-
nudation produced other loss in the erosion
of river banks and the growing aridity ot
lands which had lost the benefit of the trees.
In making good this wastage, the Forestry
Department has shown one and a quarter
millions over expenses in 16 years; and the
profit is likely to grow enormously as the
value of timber continues to appreciate with
the world shortage.

One advantage of being a picture actor
is that it is easy then to be m two places

ated and melodramatic story saved only

maintained by Mayne Lynton and Nancye
Stewart. The photography is good and the

At Fullers’ Nellie Ivolle impersonates the

Leslie Elliott sings arch songs at the piano

juggling of the Hunters is deft and pleasing.
After Jim Gerald’s “Farewell, Sydney”—a
sort of bouillabaisse of choice titbits from
his various revues —had run its riotous
course on Saturday night, the Fuller direc-
torate showed their practical appreciation of
the comedian by investing him coram populo
with a gold watch and chain and some well-
deserved eulogies. It was a pleasant cere-
mony, and the applause was hearty, especi-
ally when Essie Jennings imprinted a chaste
salute on the cheek of Benjamin Fuller, who
did the honors for the firm.
*jc :Jc :!<
When Chaliapin came on the stage of the
Melbourne Auditorium on Saturday night,
he found himself once again hemmed in on
all sides by humans, whose eyes and hands
spoke a joyous welcome. The art of this
world’s greatest songster is such that it is
not one singer who is listened to in strained
silence, but many, for he appears to change
his personality with each number. His com-
mand of facial expression and graceful ges-
ture made doubly acceptable the varied offer-
ings of his fourth concert. For the first time
during the season he was heard in English
in the somewhat hackneyed “Blind Plough-
man,” which took on fresh possibilities and
produced wild applause. An aria from “The
Barber of Seville” showed what we have
missed in not seeing the artist in opera; “The
Demon” and “The Prisoner” of Rubinstein
were other dramatic selections. There was
yet another mood in “The Old Corporal,” by
Dargomijsky—the old Corporal who, court-
martialled and ordered to be shot, calls on
the firing party to keep in step. The sheer
beauty of the star’s half-voice was admirably
displayed in Grieg’s “The Swan,” a number
usually sung by the soprano ; there was yet
more of Grieg in “An Old Song.” The
lighter vein came in the singer’s demonstra-
tion of the elegantly blithered in “The Gov-
ernment Clerk” and “The Miller.” And, of
course, “The Two Grenadiers,” “The Volga
Boat Song” and “The Song of the Flea.”
The violin solos of Hilda Sutton were warmly
encored, and pianist Max Rabinowitsh had
to supplement his solos. The Sydney dates
have been put back to permit of further con-
certs in Melbourne to-night and on Saturday.
❖❖ v ❖
If success isn’t won by the Firm with the
new production, “Tell Me More,” seen for
the first time on Saturday at the Royal, it
is at least deserved. With a book that really
calls for a super-cast, Harry Burcher has
been allowed to make a splash in all depart-
ments ; the result is a comforting cocktail
whose kick is principally due to the ballet.
Minnie Hooper’s dances and ensembles thal
revive pleasant memories. Even the gentle-
men of the chorus are a credit to the show.
The story in two acts of three scenes each
tangles and disentangles three separate love
affairs. Peggy Van de Leur, a maiden come
down in the world —descended even to a hat
and ragshop—ropes in and brands one of the
gilded upper crust, while her impecunious
brother tags one of her shopmates. That
leaves the head salesman, and he lands a
lass of homely exterior but wealthy parent-
age.
* * # *
The piece opens freshly. Instead of meet-
ing the usual young men in blazers and
maidens wearing sports frocks, you fall at
once into two boxes at the Three Arts Ball —
N’York City, of course—-from which several
of the fancy-dressed glimpse their fellow-
trippers. A duet between the hero and
heroine, who meet for the first time (and
that’s where the title comes from), is the
first vocal offering. Prom this you pass to
the day after the night before and the em-
porium before mentioned; later go on to a
fashionable hotel at the seaside, where, thank
Heaven, there are no bathing-suited misses.
The light voice of Margery Hickliu, the shop
miss, trickles through a sentimental rdle
quite agreeably, save that a song in the
second act is beyond its powers. Leyland
Hodgson,,whose vague references to his
yachting exploits are the excuse for the View-
port scene, makes the usual good lover.
George Gee (Monty Sipkin, the salesman of
the Maison Elise) and Gus Bluett (silly-
ass brother Billy) are two star comedians
who seek to bag laughs and make it a will-
ing match. Dorothy Lena and Floie Allan,
in the process of being wooed, carry on the
fun nobly. Cecil Kellaway, manager of the
hotel, deftly edges in a small part; Hugh
Steyne and Harry Wotton make the most of
limited opportunities; Emily Oxford revives
some broad comedy, and Rosie Le Varde
adds some of finer quality. And a word is
due to Fred Carpenter, the young dancer of
pleasing exterior and great agility in a couple
of specialty numbers.

The advent at a rival Melbourne playhouse
of a crowd of fellow-countrymen in more
plebeian roles has put the patrician noses of
“The Best People,” at the Atlienmum, out
of joint, and that bright entertainment de-
parts for Sydney shortly, after a remarkably
successful run. Meanwhile, “Abie’s Irish
Rose” is in its “first year in Melbourne.”
In such terms speak the prophets of the
Princess, emboldened thereto by the first
week’s results. “White Cargo,” at the
King’s, is exciting interest in theological
circles, and a special afternoon for ecclesias-
tics has been mooted. Chefalo, the magician,
has, by his arts, located Palermo, his femi-
nine assistant, and she, Irving’s Midgets and
Phyllis du Barry, a lady from London who
dances, help him to build up a moderately
amusing evening. To-morrow afternoon Pav-
lova will stir His Majesty’s dust in aid of
her waifs’ home in Paris.
The struggling British film-maker has been
finding a home from home lately in the
Majestic (Melb.). “The Happy Ending.”
an adaptation of lan Hay’s play, is the third
all-Bull product to be unfolded in this theatre
in three weeks. Fay Compton is the fond
mother who keeps her children secure in
the delusion that her deserter-husband was a
Toe H hero. Hoyt’s flow of fiction, which
includes Pola Negri as “A Woman of the
World,” and Buck Jones as “The Fighting

The last production of the Gilbert and
Sullivan season, “Princess Ida,” was rung
up at Melbourne Majesty’s on Saturday.
This generation has grown away from the
theme of the maidens who follow their Prin-
cess behind the walls of Castle Adamant,
within that select seminary to shun all
things male. Or perhaps the performers did
not succeed in making the situation suffi-
ciently humorous. Whichever it was, the
performance struck dully upon much of the
large audience. The show lacked vim, and
even the usually reliable chorus failed to
negotiate in pitch the numerous pitfalls Sul-
livan has laid for them; and the indepen-
dent ladies pleaded or hurled defiance in
tones that strayed off the key. The soldierly
males and courtiers, though in better step
musically, lacked go. The laurels, if any-
body won them, belong to producer Minnie
Everett, for the settings of the three scenes,
particularly the garden of Castle Adamant;
and the costumes left little to cavil at.
* * * *
Strella Wilson’s big soprano voice, which
is becoming somewhat hard and penetrating-
in the upper register, wavered, though she
sang her solo of the third act exceedingly
well; she looked also the part of the irate Prin-
cess. Patti Russell, whose faulty intonation
grows wearisome, was again an offender as
Lady Psyche; and Alma O’Dea, a cheerful
Melissa with a mezzo-contralto voice of pro-
mise, also met some trouble in not dropping
below the orchestra. James Hay was
Ililarion, who with his two friends, Cyril and
Florian, wormed his way into the feminine
fortress. The tenor's voice was almost
wraitli-like, presumably through cold. Leo
Darnton was happy in his tipsy song, “Kiss
Me,” and Charles Walenn had but little
scope for his comedy talent in the r6le of
King Gama, the father of the Princess.
Lance Fairfax, Sydney Granville and some
others did what was required of them credit-
ably." Slapofifski kept the orchestra up to
the mark.
Of Melbourne Tivoli's current endeavors
The Bulletin speaks with most regard of
Edward Cahill, who uses a piano to good
elfect, and George Brooke, who does the same
with his tenor voice. These two homefarors
have been doing well abroad, and Australia
hasn't been allowed to forget it. Coram,
'ventriloquist, and Niobe. the mermaid, are
also in the picture, and nothing- has hap-
pened this week to alter the opinion that the
Ghezzis are the last word in gymnic wonders.

The complimentary matinee organised by
the Melbourne Green Room Club to assist
Allan Wilkie to recover some of his losses, so
that he may again put on Shakspeare,
brought in £4OO. The Princess staged the
show, to which most of the houses in town
contributed acts ; but the thrill was given by
the burnt-out mummer himself when he an-
nounced that the Orient Co. had, at ox-Senator
Keating’s prompting, invited him to be the
company’s guest to London and back.
The loud and unpremeditated laugh is
being heard more frequently at Melbourne
Bijou, where Harold Walden, Bert Elliott,
Claude Dampier, Haley, Bent and others are
manufacturing humor out of hats and such-
like unpromising material; while Rayna Car-
bette, a new- addition, is supplying fascina-
tion. She is a Russian singer.

The Barrie season at the Adelaide Royal
ended with “Crichton.” to first-class busi-
ness. But the acting is open to discussion.
The lead is a big part, and A heme could
not fail in it • but it might be made more
of the cave-man and less of the solemn under-
graduate. And surely Tweeny was not so
completely eu-lovable fin both incarnations)
as An eel a Baddeley makes her. On the other
hand INI ary Hinton has not previously done
so well. ,
❖ * * *
Two Adelaide enticements:—
Henry Fullwood’s pictures make a good showing
at the Punster Gallery. He has been about the
world and seen beautiful things, and he reproduces
them with sound artistry. Yet there is nothing-
very striking-. The Adelaide Gallery bought a good
Australian “Cattle Crossing a River” of his nearly
HO years ago, and it is more satisfying than any-
thing he shows to-day.
On the contrary, Giles, at the Society of Arts,
is just blossoming out: sundry prizes won in open
competition lately have encouraged him to hold a
one-man show. (One woman also, Mrs. Giles, con-
tributes some good but less valuable things.) Water
is his chief interest, and he has learnt much from
Will Ashton in the treatment of it; but he con-
centrates specially on ships in port. The State
Gallery is buying his largest and most character-
istic canvas in this line.
** * *
The long and con tin nous success of “The
White Sister” at Adelaide Wondergraph
proves once more that women are most happy
when miserable; managements recognise this
and cater for it. The York programme is
mainly remarkable for House Peters, who
started his career in Adelaide, as a “lumber-
jack” in a forest fire —American, of course.
Poverty
Point
.. “Short Circuit” Ella Carrington passed
out a few days ago in Melbourne with very
little newspaper mention. Yet. for many
years her name was a household word from
Gwambygine (W.A.) to Boonmoo WO and
anywhere in between. The Taylor-Carring-
ton co. was an out-back institution in Aus-
tralia and Maoriland in the ’eighties and
onward. Many well-graced mummers had
their first stage experience with this show;
Harry Plimmer was its juvenile once. Char-
lie Taylor died rather suddenly in Melbourne
about four years ago when s.-m. for a Fuller
show. His partner was 72 at the end.
“Hamfat” : Just as he had struck into the
road to affluence, death came to Maurice
Tuohy, the good-looking stage juvenile who
a year ago joined forces with Frank Neil in
the production of old mclo-comedy hits.
Though rather too easy in his style to be a
front-rank actor —he had a tendency to walk
through his parts—Tuohy was gifted with a
good appearance and an engaging voice ; he be-
came notable with minor shows as leading
man, and last year the Firm gave him a
good part in “East of Suez.” Later Mel-
bourne Palace happened to be vacant, and
Tuohy and Neil plunged in with American
melodrama, which frosted. When things
looked black they changed over to a revival
of “Charley’s Aunt”; it minted money for
them, and so did “Are You a Mason?” The
company vacated the Palace to make way for
the “Abie’s Irish Rose” co., and before start-
ing on a Westralian tour Tuohy decided upon
a motor trip to Sydney. He got no further
than Orbost; there pneumonia closed the
chapter. He was to have married Lily
Molloy, comedienne with his company, very
shortly.
“Wigs”: “Nero” touches the spot when
he says (B. 15/7/’26) Australian actors are
“the vanishing race.” Allan Wilkie’s benefit
in Melbourne was “tendered him,” to quote
the advertisements, “by the theatrical pro-
fession.” The dramatic items on the pro-
gramme comprised selections from three
plays. Two of the plays were acted en-
tirely by Americans, and the third by a cast
recently imported from England. The thing
is rapidly approaching a scandal. The un-
employed in every other business have spokes-
men to voice their grievances and get the
ear of the public. Who will speak for the
unemployed mummer ?
“Csesar's Ghost”: The Olympic Theatre in
Lonsdale-street, Melbourne, which the crowd
never called by any other name than “The
Iron Pot” (Ooppin had it built of sheet iron
specially brought out from England), was
opened in May, 1855. A year later Dolores
Drummond made her first appearance there
in “Timor the Tartar,” and two years later
she was Desdemona to G. V. Brookes’s
Othello. Marrying a Melbourne man, W. A.
Sprague, Dolores remained 18 years in Aus-
tralia. Widowhood —she was left with no-
thing much besides five children—caused her
to return to the London stage in 1874, when
she was. 40 years old, and she kept going
for 85 years, her last appearance being in
1000 in “The Adventure of Lady Ursula.”
Her death a few days ago in London leaves
Ellen Terry the G.O.W. of the English stage.
Although Ellen, 78 in February last, was 14
years the other’s junior, both made their
first appearance in 1856—Ellen on April 28
as the child Mamillius in “A Winter's Tale,”
staged by Charles Kean.
“Baton” : Extract from Melba’s speech at
her “farewell” performance at Covent
Garden
It is a great and glorious evening, but you can
imagine what a sad evening it is for me. To think
that I shall never again, perhaps, sing within these
beloved walls!
The “perhaps” is delightfully Melba-esque.
“The Stage Cat”: Australian actors who
find tlieir means of livelihood being gradu-
ally eliminated by the wholesale importation
of foreigners derive no comfort from the
report that a firm which aims at
putting this country on the movie map
is getting its leading actors from America.
The subject of the first film under-
lined for production is Marcus Clarke’s
“For the Term of His Natural Life,” and,
if the tale is true, we shall see an Australian-
written story filmed in Australian scenery
by an American producer, and the English
and Australian characters portrayed by
Americans! Better types for the purpose
could surely be found here. And why “For
the Term of His Natural Life” anyhow? A
more savory subject might have been
selected for what promises to be the most
important attempt at picture-producing yet
made in this country.
“Voice Off”: When Allan Wilkie lost his
wardrobe, props and scenery in the fire at
Geelong there began a wave of practical
sympathy, on the crest of which Wilkie
might have ridden farther than he has
ever done if he had had a dash of Dan Barry
in his make-up. The Firm offered its help,
and no doubt would have provided a theatre.
What a chance to play “Hamlet” in modern
costume i As it is the company is dis-
banded, and Wilkie himself is off to London
to buy accessories which could be obtained
here quite well. And the wave of sympathy
is dissolving into snray. Wilkie never failed
quite so conspicuously.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Many dancing stars
have blazed since the days wheil Sylvia Grey
enchanted Australia. It is often asked has
anyone excelled the fawn-like movements of.
that Gaiety star who won the heart of Dick
Fenwick, a jovial Australian. He crossed
the bar 20 months ago, leaving Sylvia a very
wealthy widow with a town house at Cado-
gan Gardens and a lovely country place,
Little Belvoir, Melton Mowbray. Mrs. Fen-
wick has decided on a second marriage, the
fortunate man being C. D. Stewart, of Cal-
cutta, and the date June 28. During tin-
war she was the capable and very energetic
director of the Australian Officers’ Club at
138 Piccadilly, and since then has been pro-
minent in the hunting world of the Midlands.
When Sylvia and Letty Lind danced then-
way into Australian favor, their task was
lightened by the dainty picturesqueness of
their skirts. The elegant skirt-length which
they adopted held in billowy expanse by
countless petticoats of cobweb-like lace gave
those Gaiety girls a setting more effective
than any conceded in the ballets or other
dances of to-day.
THE STRONG, BRAVE MAN.
“Tripe-hound has written a novel."
“Oh — who's the hero?"
“The publisher.”
“Middle Passage” : In exposing the pseudo-
realism of “White Cargo,” “Feng-Shui' (K.
8/7/’2G) is much to the point. But he passes
over one glaring instance of false characterisa-
tion and incorrect atmosphere. That is the
presentation of Tondeleyo. This improper
young female is a West African half-caste.
Such a person from real West Africa would be
costumed either in a calico nightgown or the
even more seemly blanket or _ blue cotton
strip with which every W est African woman
of negro blood who is not under mission
or other “white” influence covers her naked-
ness from collar-bone to ankle. Even the
almost naked women of the inland as well as
“up-river” people assume a covering of some
sort when attached to a white man’s entour-
age. Tondeleyo goes arrayed in Clapham’s
idea of a South Sea Island costume, includ-
ing the cloth “gongo” round her loins, which
many Papuan tribes prefer to the grass
“rami.” Round her breasts she wears an
absurd strip of cloth, a covering which no
savage, West African or otherwise, ever
dreamed of. No ; if ever there was a Ton-
deleyo, she wore the bedgown before men-
tioned from neck to toe. And it was dirty
beyond belief—unless a client had provided
a new one a day or two before.
“C. Ockncy”: Preparatory to a London
run, a new play by Noel Coward was pro-
duced in Manchester without a title —a
unique happening. The piece had been seen
in New York under the name of "Easy Vir-
tue,” and preliminary paragraphists in Eng-
land took the title for granted. But its use
was prohibited by the British censor, so the
author, having nothing else as spicy in mind,
let his offspring loose on the public un-
named.
“L.11.P.” : The overture to “II Guarany”
as rendered by Prior’s orchestra at the
Prince Edward Theatre, Sydney, sets me re-
calling the performance of that work by
Martin Simonsen’s co. at the Melbourne
Opera House in October, 1888. It is a jolly
. opera, with line music, a good plot and
picturesque characters Portuguese ■ and
Brazilian Indians. Act iii is laid in an
Indian camp ; the evolutions and dances may
have suggested the totem business in “Rose
Marie.” Gomez, the composer, was a
Brazilian, and was only 24 when “II
Guarany” was done at La Scala, Milan.
HELLISH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The little devils in Hell chortled with glee when
some materialists seized the beautiful ‘Hallelujah’
and transformed it into a jazz tune for their own
miserable purposes.”-— Dr. A. E. Floyd, organist at
St. Paul’s, in a diatribe against jazz.
The little devils in Hell they laughed—
Laughed till their roasting ribs nigh burst,
And fiery bumpers of brimstone quaffed
To the health of the hardy wight who first,
With shrugging shoulders and shoddy whim,
Made jazz of the “Hallelujah” hymn.
They slapped one another on burning backs
And tickled themselves with their flaming tails;
They cheerfully paid their amusement tax,
For they vowed ’tis a show that never fails,
This higgledy-piggledy earth-revue
Where folly is never too old or new.
“Now, mark,” cried one, “how they twist and turn!
Why, baste me ! 1 never beheld such fun.
’Tis so they'll wriggle when here they burn,
For we’ve got them now, they are all undone.
The angels weep, as Satan sings,
When men make a mock of their sacred things,”
The little devils in Hell they cheered —
Cheered till the glowing rafters rang,
And toasting souls they gaily speared
And barbecued, the while they sang
Of what awaited a jazzing -world
In the flames that hungrily leaped and curled.
They cornered a vast supply of coal,
Enlarged their furnaces far and wide;
They knew they would need each niche and hole
When a rag-time generation died,
And as they labored they rocked with mirth
At all the absurdities on earth.
The Devil’s Highway they paved afresh
With tons of intentions, almost new-;
Threw wide the gates, when the dancing flesh
Came dipping and Charlestonfhg into view;
And looked again to the tine hot roasts
Prepared for the rioting, raggy ghosts.
AN AWKWARD SITUATION.
“And there I met the girl who ran away
with my husband—l felt so em-
barrassed
“Yes, I know —felt under an obligation to
her, and yet couldn’t offer to recipro-
cate.”
The little devils in Hell they gasped—
Gasped at the din that upon them poured,
As the snappy jazz-bands ripped and rasped
And banged and clanged and crowed and, roared ;
And stoker-imps in their sunken pits,
Although ’twas hot, had shivering fits.
* * * *
The little devils in Hell they moan—
Moan till the sizzling tears run fast;
They never had known a saxophone
In the Hellish days of the happy past.
And “Lord of the Heaven we’d once defy,
Have pity! This is too much!” they cry.
VICTORIA.
MACESS.


THE SYDNEY SHEEP SHOW lias proved a striking example of the great value of intelligent feeding. In the merino section
the honors have gone principally to Dalkeith and Canonbar, both of which studs are extensive feeders of Mcggitt’s Linseed Sheep
Nuts. All the Canonbar sheep on exhibition have been fed on Meggitt’s Sheep Nuts since birth.
Among the English breeds, the success of Mr. A. F. Carr’s Romney Marsh sheep is a striking testimony to the value of the Linseed
Sheep Nuts. In eleven classes Mr. Carr won every first prize. In the fat-sheep section, Mr. R. W. Glasson, another “Meggitt” feeder,
was extremely successful.
The following prize-winning sheep are among the successful exhibits prepared on Meggitt’s Sheep Nuts: —
DALKEITH.
Grand Champion Merino Ram.
Champion Medium-Wool Ram.
Ist Prize Medium-Wool Ram, 3 years and over.
Ist Prize Strong-Wool Ram under 2 years.

It would be conservative to estimate that 75 per cent, of the
prize-winning sheep at the Show were fed Meggitt’s Linseed Meal
or Sheep Nuts. If a measure of hand-feeding is warranted—and
this practice is now general—it pays to feed the* best. Meggitt's
Linseed Sheep Nuts have a combination of valuable properties
which cannot be obtained in any other food for sheep. They tone
up the system, add bloom, improve wool growth, and. by supply-
ing the correct nutriments, make it possible for the animals to
respond to the limit of their capacity for production.
Apart from fitting for show, the Sheep Nuts are invaluable
as a food for rams in preparation for service, as a food for breed-
ing ewes to increase both wool growth and lambing percentages,
whilst for economic sheep maintenance they have proved a veritable
godsend.
At present many pastoralists in the drought areas of Queens-
land have their sheep in tip-top condition with the aid of
"Meggitt’s,” their feeding costs being 3d. per sheep per month!
Independent press testimony of this remarkable fact
will be forwarded to any genuine inquirer.
Meggitt Limited are at present maintaining
millions of sheep in drought-stricken Central and
Northern Queensland at costs which are infinitesimal
compared with the feeding of maize, sugar-cane, or
any of the drought foods available. For this reason
the company cannot accept local business for immedi-
ate delivery. Fraziers desirous of obtaining supplies
for stud sheep, or for their rams in preparation for
service, should book their requirements at an early
date to avoid disappointment.

Electrification oflndustry
The growth of populations and the con-
sequent increasing demand for greater
production to meet man’s needs have com-
pelled industry to change from individual to
mass production.
In the steel mill huge travelling cranes and
rolling mills electrically driven do the work.
Similarly, in most industries today electricity
helps produce more and better goods under
increasingly better working conditions.
Whatever the requirements for industrial
electrical equipment, the local representatives
of the International General Electric Com-
pany can supply any need.

The New Method of Shaving
NO BRUSH. NO SOAP.
u
ghjgh
w
is it hdt strange that for hundreds of years man has
beeil scrubbing his f‘ace with soaps full of Soda and
has never reasoned that under such treatment the shift
must suffer? Nothing is more ugly than a face that
looks raw. Shaving soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with Soda.
But-now we have discovered the natural method where
no bush and soaps full of soda are needed. Shavex is a
skin food. One can shave in half the time, and you
will get a smoother and closer shave than you have ever
had, and shaving will become a pleasure instead of a tor-
ture. Your skin will look and feel like satin, and your
face under this treatment will look twice as y>ung. No
after lotions are required when using
SHAVEX
Mr. LESLIE HENSON •he famou*
actor, writes:—“l use ‘Shavex’ every
time I shave, and think it is the quick-
est, cleanest and most delightful pre-
paration ever invented for shaving.

Discussed not long ago. Incidentally, you handicap
yourself by jambitig your typewritten lines together.
.... Reynard: As you say, plenty of money and
profits are about —in paper money, which stays
because it is worth nil per lb. elsewhere. But how
often do you see a sovereign?—and the country wants
about 25,003,000 of them yearly to pay interest on
foreign public debts alone. Actually interest is paid
out of new loans, but there must be an end to
the number of mortgages you can put on the same
shack. The bubble is biggest and brightest just
before it bursts.... Zeppo: “Bosh” is. .. .S.L.M.:
You run the wheels of a ponderous dray along ruts
that have been made by a million versifiers ar.d call
it “giving rein to imagination”... .A.P.H.: The man
who drank his ten mates’ liquor was shot at dawn.
. ...R.J.H.: You take all the properties of the

don’t produce poetry from them.... R.M.M.: “Filmy-

ruin was through the low-lying land or the low,
lying land-agent... .Echo: Too faint... , H.J.W.:
Aberdeen train verse arrived too late —perhaps be-
cause written on a telegram form. .. .D.E.: Had no
idea Heaven was so dull... .T.T.: Your frivolity
about proverbs is like the gambolling of a centenarian
elephant... .E.M.: Ah, this ought to make the
bishops think: —
The mute Pumpkin is sensitive with love to pro-
duce seed.
The insect manifest loving care for its young and
nourish it
Until it is matured ; then cast out to care for itself.
The earth beringeth forth of herself. With love
and care, ’tis
Nourished until matured ; then die to give place for
the young.
So all things by commandment, some vocal, some
mute.
....Betty M.: “My lips go wandering o’er the world
to kiss his cheeks again.” You must find it dashed
inconvenient to be left like that. .. .E.M.L.: Pain-
fully conscientious... .F.S.R.: “Soliloquy”—-reali.v
an address to a defenceless infant —is too trite and
heavy.... Eileen: Moon fancy mere moonshine....

mass of weariness the account of die fight Is it
least snappy:—
His sword to hand leaped from his side.

His blood outpouring far and wide.

Margaret gazes cut to sea,
Wistfully, wistfully.
High upon yonder cliff she stands
Below the gleaming silver sands;
She is gazing out to sea.
Well, that settles it; she is... .L.A.S.: The repe-
tition of those “balloons,” “cocoons” and “lagoons”
rhymes is very unmusical, especially when you wed
“tunes” and “runes” to them... . E.R.W.: Faulty.
. ...Q.N.L.. Not sentiment; merely sediment....
S.W. J.: In' vour boat “Two heads appeared; one
held a rudder.” It should have steered your story

turned out by the yard.... Olive G.: Daybreak needs

it is, it isn’t poetry.... Ross D.: Gloomy yarn with

“(Hastor”: The Bananaland ’possum sea-
son, opened on June 1. During the month
282,000 skins were offered for sale by auc-
tion, and brought on an average 78s. per
dozen. For a small parcel 945. per dozen
was secured, aqd 10,000 skins realised 91s.
per dozen. _ The season will close on July
80, by which time it is expected over half

“T. 0.1.”: Apropos Australian tokens (B.
l/7/’26). One of the first struck bore the
superscription “Iredale and Co., Iron Mer-
chants and General Ironmongers. Estab-
lished 1820, Sydney.” On the reverse side
was a figure holding a pair of scales and a
cornucopia. Iredale’s shop was in George-
street, alongside Dan Cooper’s Waterloo
warehouse; a Hunter boOtshop now occupies
the site. The late Frederick Lassetter mar-
ried a daughter of Launcelot Iredale and suc-
ceeded to the business, which had been 106
years in existence when it closed down last
month.
* * # *
“H.F.”: It would be interesting to
know whether, of the many enterprises
undertaken or promoted by the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture, there lips been
one commercial success. The latest officially-
reported fiasco: “60 p.c. of the trees planted
on the Yenda portion of the Murrumbidgee
irrigation area are of a degenerate and
worthless type.” This follows the failure of
lucerne to grow in land picked for the pur-
pose and a variety of peach ordered to be
grown that proved quite unsuitable for the
imported canning plant. Are only the soft
in head admitted to this Government insti-
tution ; or does the microbe attack the pre-
viously normal after admission?
* * * *
“Bio”: These are the stages of evolution
in several County of Cumberland (N.S.W.)
citrus orchards: 1890, fork-hoed by hand;
1900, part hand-chipped, part horse-culti-
vated ; 1915, all horse work, weeds left that
the scuffle did not reach; 1925, orchards
cleaner and more fruitful than ever before,
the bulk of the labor being done by the white
leghorn. Fifty to the acre, their portable
roosting-liouses are shifted as they clear the
surroundings, and their droppings provide
an unequalled fertiliser. If eggs pay only
for their feed, there is a clear gain to the
citrus-grower. Exit the majority of those
depending on poultry alone. Exeunt also many
hired orchard-hands —the chooks have scabbed
their job.
* # * *
“X2X”: Nothing dies harder than the de-
lusion that the strength of whisky is indi-
cated by its coloring and that the darker
the spirit the heavier its kick. In fact all
whisky is pure white when it leaves the still;
the amber hue comes from the addition of
coloring matter, generally burnt sugar or
caramel. There is really no reason why this
should be added, but it may be a survival from
the days when all whisky was matured, of
supposed to be 'matured, in oaken casks with
the interior charred to aid in the removal
of undesirable bodies. The brownish tinge
hence became a sort of cei’tificate of long
sojourn “in the wood.” In these days, when
the undesired compounds are taken out of
the spirit during distillation, the coloring
matter is quite unnecessary.
* * ■* *
“Stellsby”: Pine-growing has proved dis-
appointing to forestry folk in the, Gisborne
district (Vic.). Some time ago the Shire
Council received only one tender in reply
to its offer to sell a number of straight, well-
developed 80-year-old pines. They went at
£1 each. Now a wattle-plantation is to be
started. These trees grow much quicker and
closer than pines, and undoubtedly show a
better return. Although Gisborne has pro-
duced’ a good deal of wattle-bark since the
’sixties, the increasing imports of S’African
bark have made it plain to local people that
they have been going slow: and fluty have
taken the * hint. Incidentally. Victoria’s
finest avenue of English elms to be found
outside Melbourne adorns the main Bendigo
road in Old Gisborne.
* * * *
“M. 8.0.” : An experiment now being car-
ried out in Queensland by' Elpliinstone,
M.L.A., owes something to The Bulletin,
through whose agency Geo. Nicklin, editor
of the Fruit Journal, got in touch with
the writer of this par. The result was a
shipment of 1200 selected pineapple-suckers
from Samoa to Elphinstone, who planted
them out, and is now aw’aiting the first crop
of pines. The suckers were procured from
H. J. Moors (since deceased), the friend of
R. L. Stevenson. Moors was the only man
in Samoa with a large area under the desired
variety. This new (to Australia) pineapple
is an excellent table fruit, large and sweet,
and carries well. There is room for a big
improvement in the Queensland pineapple;
you’ve only got to compare it with the Hono-
lulu product to see that.
* * * *
“Wart”: Touching these frenzied hunts
for scraps of missing radium (B. 17/6/’26),
how many people know the sweepings from
the floor of a jeweller’s workshop, residue
from solutions, etc., have a considerable
value ? A Footscray (Melb.) firm used to buy
the stuff from most of the Tasmanian jewel-
lers, paying on the assay value. One year
a smart young man arrived from a rival
firm and held out hopes of higher returns
if the business was transferred to him:
but the jewellers who succumbed to his
blandishments received cheques for about a
quarter the amount they expected. One of
them planned to get even, and in prepara-
tion for the traveller’s return kept his back
stairs well swept and packed the dust into
kerosene-tins. This was sweetened up with
filings and ends of brass wire, while the
real stuff from the floors was stored out of
sight. When the traveller retuimed, the
jeweller, after complaining that he had been
taken down before, refused to part with his
sweepings under £2O. After a lot of haggling
he accepted £l5 and the traveller went away
with three tins of dirt which wouldn’t assay
five grains to the ton.

fANADA —that wonderland teeming with
romance and adventure —opens unknown
beauties to those who would escape from the
hustle and bustle of life in a crowded city.
The glories, splendour and majesty of the Canadian
Rockies form an effective background for the shining
lakes and other beauty spots that lie at their feet—and
far away from all the worries and cares you can rest for
awhile in a cosy, jolly bungalow camp—or in a luxuri-
ous hotel.
The Canadian Pacific Railway
system of transportation is the most up-to-date and modern
railway system in the world. The equipment is designed for
the greatest comfort, while the service of all employees is
unequalled.
Plan ahead —book your accommodation for trains, hotels and steam-
ships prior to your departure. Through tickets to England and the
Continent of Europe are obtainable in connection with the Canadian-
Australasian Royal Mail Line to Vancouver, and the Canadian Pacific
Steamship services across the Atlantic. The New Quadruple-screw
Motor Ship “Aorangi’ (23,000 tons displacement) in connection with
the favorite s.s. "Niagara” afford an unrivalled service to and from
Vancouver, B.C.

Port Adelaide seat for 25 years—is still bale

Sub-Inspector Bill Lipp, who solves
Bananaland’s murder mysteries, is a jovial
chap. His favorite story concerns a new-
clium constable who was sent to report on
a skeleton found in the bush. The remnants
had become somewhat disarranged, the
way the constable described it was: “The
corpse was in a comfortable position, with
the head three yards away.”
“Tarago”: Another old army wheeze was
when numbering off to finish up with “Nine,
ten, jack, queen, king, ace.” We tried it
on our staff sarn-major at Broadmeadows
one morning. “Not bad,” lie commented;
“but I’m royal routine, so you’ll have to
double up on that.” And “double up” we
had to for the next ten minutes.
The Mitdhell Library (Sydney) has Henry
Lawson’s walking-stick, presented by Mrs. G.
O’Connor, a sister of the dead poet. At
the same institution is Henry’s pen, which
bears evidence of much use, being bound
together with string. Incidentally, a recent
addition to the Mitchell staff is Bertha
Lawson, 8.A., daughter of the bard; she
was formerly on the staff of the Public
Library.
Follen Bishop, the English painter, now
making a stay in Adelaide, thinks there ought
to be some artistic headquarters in London
for the Commonwealth. English people, he
says, see the work of Australian painters
only by fits and starts; there ought to be
some permanent show of their work. Inci-
dentally, it would a great advertisement for
the charms of this country. It is mostly
heard of on the other side as a land of
drought.
P. Airey in reply to Winifred Hamilton:
Mrs. Hamilton says “P. Airey makes no secret of
what children are needed for —militarism, cannon-
fodder.” I never said or implied any such thing.
My argument was that Australian children were
needed to populate this continent and that if they
were not supplied we should inevitably lose this land.
A sparse population is a standing invitation to
invasion, and Mrs. Hamilton’s methods will keep it
sparse and, sooner or later, precipitate war.
Eltham, in the heart of the Maoriland
cow country, gave itself three cheers the
other day when the cables announced thafr
one of its young men, It. D. Connell, now
in the Big Smoke, had won the Prix de
Itome, about the swankiest scholarship open
to a student of architecture ; and that Ronald
Syme, another local product, had put up a
record at Oxford by winning both the Greek
and Latin competitions at the annual
encomia.
Fifty years ago Amy Furley, aged 16
years, won a “spelling bee” at Ballarat,
defeating among others such future celeb-
rities as the late Jack Kirkland, who was
destined to become a bishop, and Joe Hock-
ing, now a Victorian High School chief.
But the winner never read of her win. The
Ballarat Courieb features a 50-years-ago
column every Saturday; and she has now
seen her victory recorded in black and white
for the first time.
“Granny” Clarke died at Harrow (Vic.)
a day or two ago. Landing at Portland in
1848 with her parents, the Thos. Mprleys,
she went direct to the Upper Glenelg. The
family squatted on about two acres in what
was later Blair-street, Harrow. Here Mor-
ley brought up his family, and “Granny”
Clarke lived on continuously at the old place
(she was known as “Aunt Sarah” to a
younger generation) till last week —78 years
on the one spot, which must be a Victorian
record.
All Australians "who cherish the memory
ot Adam Lindsay Gordon will cheer the
movement to set apart 88 acres adjacent to
Dingley Dell, the poet’s old South Austra-
lian home, near the loud-sounding sea, as a
national reserve for the preservation of
native plants, birds and beasts. The golden
wattle, of which Gordon was so fond of
singing, grows there luxuriantly. During
the 34 years since Gordon’s cottage was
acquired by the Government as a national
memorial, more than 10,000 names have been
registered in the visitors’ books.
“Gin Sling”: An American millionaire
named Leeds has been splashing it about
the Islands lately. Apia (British Samoa)
profited to the extent of nearly £l3OO in a
week. Croesus hired a car from a native
taxi-man for £7 per diem, and threw in a
bonus of £lOO at the end of the week. At
one village where he was entertained he
bought £3OO worth of goods from a trader
for a present to his hosts. On returning to
Apia, dissatisfied with the launch provided
to transport him over the 60 miles to Pago
Pago (American Samoa), he made no bones
about chartering the regular monthly M.L.
mail steamer Tofua for £4OO. Leeds is mar-
ried to some sort of relation of the late Czar.
“T.R.” : I know a family living near the
railway line in a Perth suburb whose house-
hold fuel for the winter was all won by
the eldest son. aged '2. Waiting till a rake
of open trucks, loaded with Collie coal, was
coming alonv at a rattling pace, he took a
stand on the metals and looked the other
way. The driver of the train got a sudden
eyeful of him, screeched his whistle and
jambed on his brakes. The jolt shook
hundredweights of coal off the heaped-
up trucks, and the kid fled with the engine-
men’s curses ringing in his ears. When the
coast was clear he and mother sneaked down
and gathered the spoils; and the perform-
ance, reneated three times, filled the shed.
“The Deacon” : What are the facts regard-
ing the origin of Australia’s real, muscular
first parson? At Sam Marsden’s centenary
it was claimed that he was an Oxford man
who volunteered for duty in Australia. Car-
dinal Moran, who in writing “The History
of the Catholic Church in Australasia” had
access to all the early documents, said that
Marsden, who arrived in 1794, was a black-
smith in a Yorkshire village, but forsook his
forge to join the Methodists, among whom
he soon became remarkable for his energy in
preaching. Then, in response to an adver-
tisement, he accepted the post of assistant
minister to the Australian settlement, and
being a man of singular vigor and determina-
tion lie very soon exercised a vast influence
throughout the colony.

Coughs
Colds
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
Of all the new discoveries in medical science the most remarkable of recent
years is one which has proved invaluable to thousands of people and which is
rapidly taking the place of all other remedies for the relief of coughs and colds.
This preparation is called Dr. Sheldon's New Discovery for Coughs and Colds,
and is a scientific compound of great merit. It is most healing to the lungs
and throat, and stops the cough or cold in a remarkably short time, leaving no
bad after-effects.
A few doses of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, taken when a cold is coming
on, are generally all that is needed to soothe the fever and correct the bodily
discomfort of a severe cold. It is well to continue taking New Discovery for a
day or two even after the attack seems averted, for its soothing influence on the
'mucous membrane renders one less liable to a second attack.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is a favorite Cough Remedy for men, women
and children. It will protect you this winter from any tendency to Bronchitis,
from having a bad Cold in the head and from Influenza. There is nothing better
than New Discovery to prevent or relieve the children in an attack of Croup
and Whooping Cough.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is Australia’s National Remedy and is good
for all the family.
Regular Size Bottle, 1/9; Large Size Bottle, holding two and a half
times the quantity, 3/- .

To a Dear Enemy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
lIFE, for to-day, since glad are sky
i and sea,
“ Let there be truce, mine ancient
enemy.
Till dim sea-purple with dusk-purple blends
Let us forget our feud and so be friends.
Too often have I looked into those eyes
And seen the love turned hate that in them
lies
For me, who loved you well long since. But
stay—
Was it long since? Or was it yesterday?
Surely ’twas yesterday, not long ago,
We watched those blue loved seas we used
to know ;
My child-heart held not love nor hatred then,
But youth’s wild joy that is not known of
men.
We fought with time. How was it that we
changed,
Groping ’mid shadows, bitter and estranged?
Fate was it or the irony of years.
Too blind for laughter and too sad for tears?
What matters it? The gods, relenting, smile
At my moth-soul, star-lured a little while,
A shadow singing in a dream of time,
Spinning a phantom sorrow into rhyme!
Since good, nor ill, nor joy nor pain has
power
To stay time’s dream, make truce this golden
hour.
0 life, though gods relent, the years remain :
And Youth’s green path we shall not tind
again.
Let us be friends; we’ve loved perchance
too well.
We fought, hate-scourged, in the blind lists
of Hell,
But the long twilight by the quiet shore
Falls over soon when we shall meet no more.
Long since, poor fools, we dreamed of happi-
ness;
But winds of doom blew fierce and pitiless.
We found, not the dawn-valley of our dream,
But sand, wind-parched, and darkness with
no gleam
Save where, past blank, cold skies, the dying
stars
Wrote “Death” in flame on Night’s eternal
bars,
And with no sound but of one voice that said
“The gods dreamed even as you, but they
are dead.”
Yet did we learn a deeper wisdom’s grace
There, where the blind dark watched with
formless face ; ;
We saw, beyond all lights and shades that be,
The flaming shadow which makes destiny.
Gay little clouds are curling, white as foam,
Across the turquoise sky’s transparent dome ;
The sea is like a garden of strange blooms,
With hearts of emerald and changeful
plumes.
They gleam and vanish, transient as we,
These opal-petalled roses of the sea ;
All else is still, like some dim gold lagoon.
On time's heart dreams this April afternoon.
Now crimson bells of sunset chime again
Flame’s angelus from Night’s chateau in
Spain
Till in wild beauty, mocking gods and fates,
The million-jewelled city scintillates.
The day of truce is done, yet this I know.
0 life, though grief may deem you still my
foe,
There comes a morning when, child-glad,
we’ll hear
Joy’s gods resurgent laugh Time’s riddle clear !
QUEENSLAND.
J. HOLLOWAY.
The Path of Symbol.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BERNAND was delighted to be once
more in Sydney, sitting on the front
of a ferry, gliding over the opal-blue
of the harbor to Rose Arden and the leafy
path that wound round the edge of the
sequestered bay to
He smiled thoughtfully, recollecting that
he had never been to the ajctual end of the
path.
“It can’t be very far,” Rose had said on
that last day. “Shall we go on t<J the end?”
Looking into the grey eyes, he had
answered: “No, Rose. I reelly do feel what
I said—that this path is symbolic. I am
going to keep it as my symbol of Fame,
which, after all, is the greatest gift Life has
to offer.”
They had stopped just before a bend in the
path, the green bush of the reserve tower-
ing above them, and, below, the quiet water
of the bay.
“Fame?” she had said quietly. “Yes.
Brian, I suppose you must go if you feel
that way about it.”
“Of course, I must,” he told her earnestly.
“Fame, Rose—l feel that it is just round
the corner.”
She had given him back the ring then.
He had protested, but she had put her hand
into his. “Go out untrammelled. Brian,”
she had decided. “No correspondence, mind.
You will win your life’s goal quicker with-
out ties.”
He left soon after for England without
seeing her again : unexpectedly she had gone
away the next day on a trip up the coast to
Brisbane and on through the Barrier Reef.
He fitted a cigarette precisely in the gold-
tipped amber holder, catching a distorted
glimpse of his handsome face in the heavy
silver case. He felt that he had reason to
feel satisfied. The first nowel alone had
established him among the fading writers
of the day. The other four, .written in the
five years since then, had enhanced that posi-
tion even beyond his most egotistic dreams,
some reviewers of the most recent had placed
him among the ten leading English novelists.
Rose would have seen the frequent appear-
ances of his name in the press, have gloried
in the rapid progress.
Looking over the water to the red and
white cottages climbing up from the harbor s
rim, lie thought back to the Kensington gar-
dens flat, bis perfect bachelor quarters, ror
live years it had satisfied him; then one
morning when the sky was low and grey and
the snow spread white over the denuded
trees, he had felt that there was something
missing. Even though he had not written
to her, he had thought often of Rose, had
kept her photo and the four-stone ring to-
gether on his dressing-table. Coming back
from looking out over the winter-shrouded
park, he had felt emotionally that the one
thing missing was the original of the photo,
the quiet-spoken, grey-eyed girl who had
worn the ring. Another thought had come
then, disturbing: If she had not waited.
But the discomfiture was momentary. He
-was famous—-Rose would wait. He knew
women.
On tin l way out from England the disturb-
ing thought had returned. There was, lie
remembered, a young fellow named John
Redmond. The thought made him uneasy
over.the latter part of the voyage; but that
was all over now. He smiled at the thought
that it should ever have disturbed him. Of
course, Rose would wait —he had won
fame.
-He touched a cigarette-ash from his per-
fectly-tailored coat. She had herself an-
swered the ’phone when he rang her mother’s
house. Her voice was unaltered. The same
Rose—lie knew exactly how he would see
her.
She was in the garden when he stepped
off the ferry and strode along from the end
of the tramline turn towards her. He
noticed from nearly one hundred yards away
that she. was wearing a frock of the con-
trasting navy and cinnamon tones that he
had once told her suited the pink tints of
her cheek and the bronze glint of her hair.
But it was not till she had stepped out
through the gate and was shaking hands with
him on the edge of the path that he felt
the full power of what seemed to him a new
attractiveness.
“Rose, Rose !” he cried earnestly. “What
a wonderful change in five years!”
The thin fingers, still gripped, tingled his
hand. At that moment she seemed the most
desirable thing in the world.
She smiled. Somehow the smile crept up
into the wide grey eyes and remained shining
there, making her more desirable than ever.
“And how is Fame, Brian?” she asked
sweetly. “You see the Path of Symbol is
still here.”
An answering smile flitted across his vain
mouth. “And - I can take you to the exact
spot where we performed the christening, if
it isn’t covered with a flat or something.”
“No, it’s still there. Even the grass
doesn’t seem to have grown an inch. I have
been to it often.”
She had been to it often! He felt what
that told. How true to the self-sacrificing
spirit of Woman! “Come along then, Rose,”
he said. “We’ll see if I really can lead you
to the spot.”
They went on side by side: she asking a
question now and then of his work, he
answering readily, telling her proudly of
some of the latest reviews that had hot
reached Australia. Already the sun had
gone down: a tiny breeze spread little
ruffled carpets on the darkening water. There
was no sound but their own steps on the
earth and a faint rustling of the leaves; they
had the path alone.
“Isn’t it wonderful, Rose?” he was saying
—“you and I together again walking along
this path of fantasy? England’s beauty seems
a tamed, unvarying creature compared with
all this vividness. And you realß are glad
to see me?”
“Of course. How could I help it? You
are famous now, Brian, you know; and we
poor earthworms must acknowledge genius.”
Queerly, he felt that there was in that
something which cut two ways. He looked
at her sharply. The genuine admiration
which he detected in the grey eyes dispelled
doubt. It was the lesser-mate instinct sur-
vived from the earliest ages. As their eyes
met, he felt again, passionately, the new lure
of her loveliness. In his latest novel he had
epitomised that feeling as he had imagined it.
“Love,” he had written —“love, the sanctified
name for the sex urge.” Now that it
mingled with his own emotions he found
vocabulary and imagination curiously help-
less to cope with it. He told himself over
and over as they went on that he loved
Rose, that next to Fame —almost parallel
with it —she was the most desirable thing
the world held.
He stopped her suddenly near the white
bole of a sapling gum, just before a turn
in the path.
“I thought for a moment you had for-
gotten,” she cried happily. “Why, Brian,
it’s wonderful of you to remember it so
exactly after five years.”
Again her words caused an unaccountable
twinge, but her smile was unmistakably
genuine. The twinge was merely conscience.
“How could I forget it, Rose?” he asked.
“Do you remember why I would not go
on to the end of the path? Didn’t I hold
it symbolic of Fame, which goes on and on
and is without end?”
“There was always a large streak of
poetry in you, Brian,” she told him. “I
believe you would have been equally famous
as a poet if yon had not chosen fiction.”
“But the poets,” he spoke contemptuously
—“they rarely achieve fame in their lives.
I wanted to feel my fame.”
“And you have,” she put in enthusiasti-
cally. “Why, you are famous even here in
your own country. The path has been a
true symbol. Would you believe. Brian, that
I have never been one step beyond this
spot?”
Laughing, he suggested then that they
should go on to the end. He felt certain of
how it would end —looking out over the
water of the great hai’bor.
“I’d love it,” she cried; and they went on.
They came to the end abruptly. Below
them was a level space with a rise beyond

SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Mr. A. B. Cowell, who lives at the corner of Park Road
and Hardy Street, Mascot, Sydney, says Some months ago 1
suddenly seized with a tenable pain across my back, just
above the kidneys. It did not go away, as I thought at first it
would, but, on the contrary, it got worse, and 1 was soon so bad
that I was bent almost double. I was completely crippled and
even at night I got very little rest from the constant pain. 1
could not turn over without suffering acutely, in fact, no
position was comfortable for long. My secretions were affected,
being thick and cloudy, with a red sediment. I tried different,
remedies, but they gave me no relief whatever. One day a
friend suggested I should take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
and it orovod to be good advice, too, for three bottles cured me
completely. I feel splendid now, and my recovery is due solely
to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Four years later Mrs. Cowell says“My son is still well.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills having completely banished all
signs of kidney trouble.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all chemists and stores
at 2/9 per bottle, or from Foster-McClellan Co.,

Doan’s Ointment for Itching and Pro-

I had tried all kinds of Ointments, but

shutting out any glimpse of the harbor.
To him the end came as a distinct ,shock.
He stood beside her on the bare brink of a
landslide, looking down upon what seemed
to him a crudely prosaic spectacle. At the
foot of the short incline a narrow, muddy
stream wound round the closer edge of a
Chinese market-garden. Almost directly be-
low them, his trousers rolled up over his
knees, his head bare, an old Chinese stood
in the middle of the shallow stream. In his
right hand he gripped a scrubbing-brush;
in the other, carrots newly pulled from the
garden. As he washed each bunch with
half a dozen deft sweeps of the brush, he
threw it into-a basket on the bank and took
up another bunch from the shallow beside
him.
For a second Bernand felt that Rose
1 1 ad brought him deliberately to this scene
at the end of the Path of Symbol. “I wonder
is it true?” he asked, suddenly. "This —he
waved towards the old gardener —“this wash-
ing of earth things? Is this prosaic busi-
ness the end of the path of Fame?”
■‘What nonsense, Brian!” she said.
"There’s no parallel at all.”
His fingers closed about her hand. “At any
rate, Rose dear,” he said, “the path has given
you back to me. I have my fame. I want
only you now to complete all the world can
give.”
She tried to protest, but he drew her to
him passionately. “Fame, fame and you,
Rose,” he reiterated.
She struggled, broke free. “But. but.
Brian,” she said firmly, “I cannot now —I
married .Tolin Redmond —I—l am staying at
Mother’s.”
For a moment he stared at her incredu-
lously. John Redmond, who had* no thought
of fame!
“And you led me to believe you still cared,”
lie said hotly.
She laughed lightly. “Don’t deceive your-
self, Brian,” she said. “You know you have
the only thing in the world you love. You
have fame. And now I must be going back.’’
He shrugged his shoulders. “Good night,”
lie said.
“Still the same old Brian; Fame hasn’t
altered you a scrap,” she said with, a sweet-
ness in which he now detected a fine note
of mockery.
He stayed on, looking down at the old
Chinese washing away at the bunches of
carrots. Some of them were a little larger
than others, but, big and little alike, they
went in the end into the basket and were
covered up out of sight. Another symbol of
Fame?
Touching the side of his coat, his hand
felt the small package in the pocket; a rope
of fine pearls lie had bought for Rose and
forgotten in the excitement of her haunting
loveliness. She was quite right, of course.
He deserved to find her married. He had
been selfish; but. he told himself with a
return of heat, he had had to reach Fame,
the greatest thing in the world.
! He decided to overtake her before she
reached the house and ask her to accept
the gift as a wedding present. Striding
along, he wondered why he did not catch up
with her*. She must have hurried. Near the
gate her Amice stopped him. She was already
stepping in through the door the maid was
holding open for her.
“... . And, Ethel,” he heard her saying,
“when Mr. Redmond calls, will you send
him up to me on the balcony?”
As clearly as Rose’s Amice, the voice of
the maid came to him.
“Yes. Miss Arden.”
And the door closed Avith a snap.
CECIL MANN.
A Dream of Fair Cows.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Till'] outer yards, knee-deep in mud, no
longer caused me to swear. My day-
dreams had come true at last. I had
the best cowshed —or, rather, milking-
chamber —ever built in Maoriland. The
edifice, which was of severe but noble archi-
tecture, comprised two distinct compart-
ments—perhaps I should call them courts.
One constituted the milking-chamber proper,
the other the separator-room. An auxiliary
apparatus fed pigs automatically—pigs no
longer need be pigs. The yards, tastefully
cemented, had imposing entrances. Huge
brick pillars topped with cows regnant, bear-
ing'shields. framed magnificent gates of gilded
iron, in place of the old slip-rails.
Hanging round the walls of the milking-
chamber wore photographs of nearly all the
metnbers of my herd ; the inscriptions under-
neath told my visitors that these cows were
not only champions themselves, but had
descended from generations of champions.
Their butter-fat record was in no case less
than 10001 b. a year. Patriarching it over them
all was the champion bull of Australasia.
He had points so well defined that anybody
could see them.
Parked outside the building, I could just
glimpse my eight-cylinder motor-car. I
always rode to the milking in my car. I
also rode home again.
I glanced at my watch. The time was 11
a.m. —milking-time, to be sure. Where were
my men? I struck a gong and sank back
upon a soft divan near the inner yard. At
once half a dozen men, each wearing a smile
and a white coat, appeared before me. Not
one of these stout fellows was in any way
connected with a labor union.-
“Yes, boss?” queried Sam, the foreman.
“Briijg hither the kine,” I commanded,
waving my hand airily in the direction of
the paddocks—l mean, the pastures.
“Sure, boss.” All the. men except Rastus
glided away swiftly and silently. Rastus
remained behind. He helped me to light a
cigar.
A few minutes later I heard a gentle low-
ing, more musical by far than any sounds
that the poets, in their most licensed and
optimistic moments have ever attributed to
cows.
“They approach, Rastus, I said languidly.
“Play 'Hail. Smiling Morn.’ ”
“Yes, sir.” Rastus sprang with alacrity
to the gramophone, and just as the cows
ant-erod the outer gate—or portal—the onen-
iug bars were sung by Galli-Curci. As every-
body knows, cows love music. I got the
best out of mine by catering for them thus.
I rose from my chair to welcome the
animals with a little courtly how and a
sweep of my hat. Politeness hurts nobody.
I knew them all by name, and their names
had been chosen thoughtfully. None of your
‘‘Daisies” and “Cherries” about my bevy of
beauties. In the lead came Tetrazzini, fol-
lowed closely by Melba, Calve, Patti, Nordica
and Amy Sherwin. High-sounding names
for cows, you will say, but we had no awk-
ward moments. We never needed to talk of
pulling Melba out of the bog because there
were no bogs on the estate.
The twelve bails available were filled
expeditiously and without vulgar crowding or
disorder. Rastus kept the music going while
his colleagues went about the preparatory
work with an easy grace, most pleasing to
the eye. The milking-machine motor started
with a mere flick of a switch, and so quiet
was its hum that the strains of the gramo-
phone were easily audible.
I sighed with pleasure, and lay back to
watch operations. Mind you, I didn’t need
to put in an appearance at milking-time a r
all on my place, but I have always main-
tained that an employer should show his
workmen a good example. Accordingly I
commenced to work. As the milking went
on apace I began to wonder how much I
could do on behalf of suffering humanity if
my cows could be induced to give wine in-
stead of' milk. However, that as yet was
but an idle fancy.
It took very little time to put my
hundred-odd head of beasts through, because
never on any account did one strip them.
Instead, all the strippings were left till the
end of the season, when we had one big-
strip for each cow as she went dry. By
this means I amassed a large cheque to tide
me over the winter months.
To the’strains of “The Rest of the Day
Is Your Own” the herd moved forth again
to the pastures. I called for Rastus to drive
me home. Sam and his men remained to do
the cleaning up, which, with the appliances
at hand, was mere child’s play. Work was
practically over for the day. We never
milked in the* evening in Utopia. To ..secure
the same results as those formerly obtained
by two milkings, it was only necessary to
train the cows properly.
As the car glided along the private road
through the fields —we had left off calling
them paddocks—l noted with pleasure the
quantity and quality of my acres. The win-
ter turnip crop looked big enough for two
winters. The hay-grass was just shooting
skywards for the third time. The creek —
nay, the brook —meandered lazily through my
private golf course to form the most sport-
ingly annoying of hazards. Glistening in the
rays of mid-day sun it reminded me that
Billy Murdock, my neighbor, would probably
be over for an after-lunch round.
When we reached our boundary fence I
noticed that my bull was grazing with Mur-
dock’s herd. I chuckled as I pictured Billy’s
pleasure at this unexpected visit. No doubt
he would return the compliment by sending
his bull over to me for a few days. We
were great pals, Billy and I.
Home at last, and a pretty little, wife to
greet me!
“Hubby, dear,” she said as she reluctantly
withdrew her arms from my neck, “Mr.
Murdock is waiting in the office to see you.”
•'Ho, lio!” I cried gaily. “Over for lunch
and golf, I suppose. Lead me to him.”
Almost before I had time to close the door
of my office Billy rushed at me with out-
stretched hand. He seized mine, pumped it
up and down vigorously, then smacked me
on the back until I managed to gasp, “Why,
all the exuberance, old man?”
“Have you heard the news?” he cried.
“Great! Splendid!”
“Out with it, man. Is butter-fat up to
2s. fid. a pound?” I was becoming im-
patient.
“No, no! But the Government has re-
valued our sections! Our rent is down 75
per cent.!”
I felt myself swooning from the shock.
Billy caught me as I was falling and laid
me gently on the sofa.
The next thing I remembered was hearing
my wife ask “Is he hurt much, Mr. Mur-
dock?”
“No,” Billy was saying. “The brindle cow
must have kicked him, for he was lying be-
hind her when I found him. Got any whisky
in the house?”
“Yes, but I don’t know where to find it.”
At that I sat up. I knew my bearings at
once. I was lying on the old sofa in the
kitchen. The whisky
“You’ll find it behind the jam jars on the
top shelf of the cupboard,” I said quickly.
“Gosh. Billy, that Brindle’s a fair cow, isn’t
she? She got me behind the ear while I was
leg-roping her.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When gorged and gurgling gutters run,
And drenched are street and lane,
No man is there so lost, so blind,
Who knows his kind and loves his kind,
Though he be soaken to the skin
That will not bless the rain.
He’ll think of stricken herds that moan,
With sunken heads and flanks.
And pastures dry and burnt and brown,
And as the leaden cloud sweeps down
He’ll stay his steps and raise his eyes
Like one uplifting thanks.
For none there be who know the prayer
Of sapless leaves and flowers,
Of starving flocks and famished herds,
And failing crops and thirsting birds,
Who do not joy within their hearts
To see God’s answering showers.
Though drenched and to tlieir marrow chilled
They count their hardship small;
For as they trudge through street and lane,
Through driving gale and pouring rain,
They seo in dreams long tables spread
.With meat and bread for all.
