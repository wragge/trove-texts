The Week’s Best:—
CHURCHILL’S
BRILLIANT
MARLBOROUGH
Said by pub-
lisher Harrap,
when he was
here, to be cost-
ing £20,000 to
have written and
produced, and originally intended to be
done in two volumes, Winston Church-
ill’s Marlborough: His Life and Times
is now in its second volume, and there
is another to come.
The first volume had to do with the
52 years during which the coming Marl-
borough moved from virtual penury to
his dubious youth at the Court of
Charles; his marriage ; his desertion of
James to the favor of William; the
notorious letter alleged to have given the
French news of the impending attack
on Brest; his foreseeing friendship with
Anne, and—a spectacular climax —the
death of William. That volume alone
might have justified the publisher’s risk ;
the complete work promises to be one of
the finest literary productions of a time
of general haste, rubbishy writing, and,
in this particular medium, pandering to
“popular” taste.
As could have been expected, the work
is a vindication of Churchill’s ancestor,
whose father was also a Winston. It
scorches those —in the first volume
Macaulay, in the second the Austrian
Klopp—who have depicted Marlborough
as one of the most despicable great char-
acters of history. Churchill passes over
the possibility that Macaulay wrote from
a large ignorance, also that he certainly
was unaware of most of the original
manuscripts upon which the present work
is based. He accuses Macaulay of deli-
berately falsifying facts, and of using—
maliciously—the silly say-so of that
wretched woman, Mrs. Manley, on
whose evidence, he says, most of the
traducing of Marlborough has been
based.
“Lord Macaulay,” says Churchill, “in-
corporated these forgotten slanders ver-
batim in his stately pages, and set them
rolling round the world Mrs. Manley
is Lord Macaulay’s witness ; and, coun-
tersigned by his great name, cannot be
swept incontinently back into the cess-
pool from which she should never have
crawled.”
As invective that is scorching enough,
but Churchill in it is only warming up
to the job. He adds: “Lord Macaulay’s
life-work lay in the region of words, and
few have been finer word-spinners. Marl-
borough’s life is only known by his
deeds. The comparison is unequal, be-
cause words are easy and many, while
great deeds are difficult and rare. But
there is no treachery or misconduct of
which Macaulay’s malice has accused
Marlborough which is not equalled, were
it true, by his own behavior in this
domain of history and letters over which
he has sought to reign.”
That is passable invective, too (though
“Marlborough’s life is only known by his
deeds” is ridiculous of one whose extant
writings approach a million and a half
words). This, possibly, should come
under the heading, not of invective, but
of abuse: “The grandeur and sweep of
Lord Macaulay’s story-telling style car-
ries him swiftly along, and with every
generation he enters new fields. We can
only hope that Truth will follow swiftly
enough to fasten the label ‘Liar’ to his
genteel coat-tails.”
Apart from such blistering outbreaks,
of which Klopp comes in for his share
in this second volume, the work is solid
rather than spectacular. There is, com-
ing from Churchill, an oddly old-
fashioned air about much of the phrase-
ology. He almost always refers to Marl-
borough as “our hero,” “the hero of our
tale.” That “hero” has, of course, been
vilified, or condemned, on two grounds
mainly—the private- or personal-morality
one of his avarice (which even Churchill
does not dispute), and the public one of
his treachery to James and, allegedly, to
England. In regard to the avarice
Churchill makes out an elaborate ex-
planation. The sum of it is that Marl-
borough’s penurious childhood in the
roofless family house at Ashe, and his
subsequent poverty as a youth in the
rich Court of Charles, cut so deeply
into his subconscious that he ever after
appreciated to an almost fanatical
extent the value of money. On the other
hand, Churchill points out that Marl-
borough, as a young man, deeply in love
and wanting to marry, was yet capable
of sinking these vital self-interests and
sacrificing his entire heritage to enable
his father to get out of debt.
As to the treachery, Churchill’s ex-
planation is that the desertion of James
for the side of the invading William was
a long-planned act, deliberately made at
exactly the right moment to serve the
right interests of England ; not the act
of a traitorous opportunist —which, in
spite of Churchill, it looks not unlike —
but the single deed that could have
averted civil war: in fact, not the act of
a deserter, but of a singularly courageous
patriot. It is a remarkable reading of
history, which is, after all, mostly a
matter of these nice interpretations.
Churchill seems on sounder and better
ground in regard to the ill-smelling letter
to James in exile concerning a coming
British attack on France. His years of
research—which ate up most of the pub-
lisher’s £20,000 —have established the
important fact that no original of that
letter exists, nor is there any convincing
evidence that there ever was an original.
The Paris depository of the alleged
document Churchill declares to be, from
floor to roof, the greatest fraud that has
ever taken in historians.
In this second volume Churchill con-
tinues to exploit the very fertile charac-
ter of his hero, but, though here in the
first four years of his great shaping of
European destiny, the figure seems
strangely diminished, maybe because his
size is so great that he gets rather beyond
A Low version of our author.
human. Without conceding to the alleged
demand for “popular” writing, Churchill
makes of his solid subject reading
easier than the average fiction attains to.
This he does chiefly by relating the past
times of which he writes to those in
which he has lived, a device which makes
the reader a sort of contemporary to the
people of the work.
The first volume, in which the empha-
sis is so strongly on the person of Marl-
borough, is the better of the two for any
normal reader’s requirements. The second
is historical above biographical. The
third, to deal with Marlborough’s dis-
grace and banishment, should make a
fine climax to what is—in spite of the
first volume covering 52 years and the
second only four —a remarkably well-
balanced piece of work.

A Great
English Editor
Passes
A. R. Orage,
whose death was
mentioned in the
cable news the
other day, was
England’s most
brilliant editor. He was one of the few
distinguished writers who believe that
editing is an art, and are content with its
rather anonymous glory. Twenty-five
years ago, when his little book on
Nietzsche made a flutter in literary circles
and publishers and reviews were besieg-
ing him with offers of highly-priced con-
tracts, he told them abruptly that he had
no time for outside writing, that all his
attention was taken up with his paper.
His paper at that time was the “New
Age.” He and Holbrook Jackson had
picked it up from some dumpheap or
other, and, though there was no money
behind it, the verve of Orage’s political
and literary criticism was making it the
most-talked-of paper in London. Yet
it was not merely a matter of the paper’s
style and spirit. Orage’s personality fas-
cinated people who did not agree with
his judgments. He attracted men as
diverse as Shaw and Chesterton, Belloc
and Wells, and they were content to
write their best for him without pay,
even the shrewdly-commercial Arnold
Bennett contributing a literary causerie to
the paper for some years on the same
terms.
“I have no money,” Orage wrote to
me in those early days when accepting
a story. “My contributors write for love
and honor.”
But there was also a stimulus of his
literary criticism and of personal contact
with him. If a writer had shown promise
Orage was never too busy to write half
a dozen close-packed pages analysing
some story or article he was rejecting,
pointing out how and where it failed.
That was his conception of an editor’s
job. Inevitably he gathered around him all
the young people who were beginning to
write. He published the first work of St.
John Ervine, W. L. George, J. C. Squire,
Ashley Dukes: there was hardly a rising
star of those pre-war days who did not
aim at getting something into his paper.
I remember going into the otherwise-
empty office one day and stumbling on
a bright, dark-eyed girl sitting on the
edge of a chair biting at the end of her
pen. It was Katharine Mansfield cor-
recting, in a state of subdued excitement,
one of her first proofs. Others who were
encouraged to write by him were our
own Will Dyson and (ironic memory!)
Michael Arlen, then a clever young
Armenian new to the English scene.
It was essentially a young man’s
paper. The older men gradually grew
restive under the pointed criticism in
Orage’s “Reader’s Notebook.” Arnold
Bennett protested that he was writing in
one column and being gibbeted in

another. Wells, in “Boon,” pictures Orage
climbing up a tree at the solemn con-
clave of authors in Switzerland and rid-
dling their composure with “unhelpful
remarks.” But he was interested in prick-
ing the bubble of established reputation
and clearing the air for the younger gen-
eration.
On Mondays, when the weekly was
put to bed, there were gatherings at
a small teashop in Chancery Lane,
the company afterwards adjourning to
some restaurant for dinner. Orage liked
to talk, liked to have a bright crowd
around him. He was reputed to be the
best conversationalist London had known
since Wilde. In appearance he was not
unlike the early Wilde, but trim-bodied
instead of lax, lively of eye rather than
lethargic. And his wit was never merely
irresponsible like Wilde’s ; it arose out
of his convictions, his point of view. Of
the crowd who used to come fairly regu-
larly to those gatherings I remember
Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound with his
golden beard and shy manner, Richard
Curie, the friend and biographer of
Conrad.
A year or so after the war Orage sold
his review, having become interested in
the philosophy and way of life of some
Russian mystic. Together they founded a
colony at Fontainebleau—the colony at
which Katharine Mansfield died. After-
wards he went to America lecturing, and
1 heard little of him till a couple of years
ago when I was camping on the Barrier.
“I am starting a new review,” he wrote,
“and am gathering together the old
forces, so, take this as a call to action.”
But there were difficulties. A little
later he wrote that it was heavy going,
that “young men aren’t as spirited as
they used to be.” Perhaps it was partly
that he was no longer young himself.
The cables give his age as 61, and it is
hardly possible to make life repeat itself.
VANCE PALMER.

A-pioneering
Andrew Muri-
son McCrae, a,
young lawyer of
London, emi-
grated to Mel-
bourne in 1840,
his wife and young children joining him
the following year. Mrs. McCrae was
a Gordon (a relative of the Duchess),
and had great talent as a miniaturist.
McCrae went into a law partnership in
Melbourne, but soon quarrelled with his
partner and was in financial difficulties,
the family for some time, apparently,
being dependent on Mrs. McCrae’s
annuity of £lOO a year. So eventually
(the Duchess of Gordon having declined
to buy it for them, sending a paltry £lOO
instead) they had to leave their nice
house (one of the best in Melbourne in
those days) and go to live in the wilds.
They had no money to buy sheep, but
managed to get huts (and later a house)
built—labor was cheap—and the family
went on expanding at the steady rate of
one child per year. Into exile with them
went the family’s faithful tutor John
McLure, Master of Arts, who endeared
himself by refusing to take his salary. So
highly did Mr. McCrae appreciate his ser-
vices that when one of the maids was sus-
pected of setting her cap at McLure she
was immediately sent away. If McLure
were married, reasoned McCrae, he would
set up a school. At last the family for-
tunes were saved (being of the very best
people the McCraes had plenty of in-
fluence) by the appointment of McCrae
as a police magistrate. McCrae’s brother
Alexander, after a term as acting-post-
master in Melbourne, became Postmaster-
General in the first Victorian Govern-
ment. Another brother, Dr. Farquhar
McCrae, also an early citizen of Mel-
bourne, seems to have been comfortably
off. There is no mention of financial
straits in his case.
Such is the background of the diary of
Mrs. Andrew McCrae (Georgiana), re-
produced almost verbatim for the years
1840 to 1846 and in lesser detail for
earlier and later years by her grandson
Hugh McCrae in Georgiana’s Journal
(Angus and Robertson; 215.). The Mc-
Craes met everybody who was anybody
in the new settlement; and Georgiana’s
chronicle is supplemented by.long paren-
thetical notes by Hugh McCrae concern-
ing such worthies as Superintendent La
Trobe, Ben Boyd, Oswald Brierly, Foster
Fyans (a great character with a tongue
like a rasp) and Bob Hoddle. Illustra-
tions are copious, and include many
sketches made by Georgiana in Mel-
bourne’s first days. She was, according
to her self-portrait, a very handsome
woman. Her husband, referred to always
as “Mr. McCrae,” seems to have been a
man of few words and strong prejudices,
and, whoever pitied poor Georgiana,
forced to rough it in barbarous places
(but always with servants at beck and
call), he didn’t.
By no means a heroic story. The
McCraes didn’t amass vast wealth or
carve pages in history, but they might
easily have done so had circumstances
jumbled a little differently. While
they doubtless considered themselves
martyrs, none of them, save Georgiana,
seems to have had much to grumble at.
She, poor soul, long cherished hopes
of a return to the land of her birth,
but died at 84, the hope long dead.

The Laureate
and the
Local
The recent im-
portation of the
Laureate serves
as a good ex-
ample of the
workings of that
very curious thing, the official mind.
The Australian writer who sets out
realistically to portray his country meets
with persecution and pettiness at' every
turn. If not officially outlawed, as was
Norman Lindsay’s Redheap and J. M.
Harcourt’s last book, his work is sub-
jected to the inane denunciations of
illiterate wowsers and prurient old maids
—as, for instance, Bernard Cronin’s
Sow’s Ear.
Contrast this treatment with that given
to Mr. Masefield. The people who grow
emotional at the adulation of Mr. Mase-
field are the very ones whose moronic
instincts should be combated by official-
dom, instead of being pandered to, as has
happened in the past few weeks. The
man who deserves the praise of Australia
is the one whose loyalty is such that
he will say openly and fearlessly what he
thinks is wrong with it, and who, if a
writer, will set down plainly what he has
seen and knows.
Of course, he will get no immediate
reward. Like Henry Lawson, he will be
ignored when the speeches are made and
the lollystick poles are lit. In the end,
however, he will prove a worthier Aus-
tralian than them all.
I think Harry Lawson would have
appreciated the centenary. Maybe he’d
have written a poem to a literary Texas
Jack.

at once suggest to a trained ear that
this was the first line of a verse of
real poetry? In the first stanza, too,
“come” is made to rhyme with “home,”
and in the second a still worse rhyme is
used, “peace” with “peas.”
We should like to know how the Aus-
tralians managed
So that before half earth had heard their
tiame,
Half earth had learned to speak of them
with fear.
There is in the ode no reference to the
noble band of pioneers and the contrast
between what they found with that of
their successors only a century later. It
does not, in short, reflect the spirit of the
centenary tribute. The last three verses
are stodgy and devoid of rhythm, and the
whole composition so forces the Muse
that it will not add to the author’s repu-
tation. His fame will rest upon his prose
and not upon his poetry, of which “The
Recessional” is the only example likely
to survive the present generation.

A Satchel of Books
The Wild Planet, by Walter Murdoch
(Angus and Robertson ; 4s. 6d.), is a col-
lection of essays in the vein of previous
volumes from the same pen. The fact
that Murdoch is a university professor
(he holds the Chair of English at Perth)
is usually insisted on by his reviewers,
but these excursions are distinctly not
professorial, though they are couched in
very warm, living English, and the writer’s
erudition peeps out at times, though he
strenuously avoids parading it. The
essential Australianism of Murdoch’s
outlook, his self-reliance of opinion and
the shrewdness of his literary judgments
should endear him to every wide reader,
for he brings something like a national
touchstone to many books and many
problems. He has faith and charity and
hope, hates woolly sentiment like the
devil, and h'as a flair for a neat wind-up.
Verse, the shape and color of a sum-
mons, is a monthly that hails from
Temuka (M.L.) and contains 11 pages of
verse. Discovery that it isn’t a subpoena
should ensure for it a good reception,
especially from anyone who has memo-
ries of Temuka —a blameless hamlet
which occasionally harbors a band con-
test. Verse has reached its sixth con-
secutive issue, and its contributors hail
from Auckland in the north to Dunedin
in the south. There’s even a poem from
Sydney. Far be it from this commen-
tator to say a word to damp the ardor
of the publishers. Long may Verse
flourish!
How to Run a Bassoon Factory, by
Mark Spade (Hamish' Hamilton ; 3s. 6d.
net). An amusing skit on modern busi-
ness methods, written in typical “Punch”
style. Dislike of bassoons need not deter
the reader, as the instructions are equally
useful for those desirous of running a
bracelet or bassinet factory.
The Man and the Hour (Philip Allan)
is a transcript of lectures delivered at
Ashridge College, and deals with Edward
VII., Lenin, Briand, Pilsudski, Musso-
lini and Hitler. Only one of the lec-
turers, Bruce Lockhart, who gives a brief
biography of Lenin, seems to have had
any first-hand knowledge of his subject,
and even he can add nothing to what has
appeared in almost all newspapers. The
thread that runs through the discourses
is Shaw’s observation in Apple Cart:
“One man that has a mind and knows it
can always beat ten men who haven’t
and don’t.” The tone in general is more
idolatrous than critical —particularly in
regard to Hitler —and the editing has not
been very thorough, for on p. 34 we have
Lenin drinking his beer at the Caffi Lan-
dolt in Geneva, and on p. 51 we are
assuied that he “neither smoked nor
drank.”
The Signet of Death, by Louis Grey
(Nicholson and Watson ; 7s. 6d.), con-
tains a masked assassin who has a ring
(the “signet of death”) conveyed in a
matchbox on one of the fingers of its late
owner to a prospective victim. Among
the malefactor’s idiosyncracies is “a low
laugh” which sends “icy waves through
the Yard men’s brains.” The Yard men,
Crane and Stevens, are so persistently
facetious at each other’s expense tha-t
the reader has no difficulty in following
the plot; and they never say anything
funny. A thriller to be avoided.
Play-reading or -acting societies or in-
dividual play addicts who want to get
the fattest value for their money are
made yet another extravagantly generous
offer by Gollancz, who has put out, at
Bs. 6d. (English price) a tome entitled
Fifty One-act Plays; 1024 pages of the
work of such folk as Chekhov, Gals-
worthy, Wilde, Maeterlinck, Yeats, Ervine
and a yard and a half others. It is es-
pecially good value because most of the
work represented is not easily obtained.
What the Cross Means to Me, by the
Right Rev. and Right Hon. Arthur Foley
Winnington-Ingram, Lord Bishop of
London (Unicorn Press ; 2s. 6d., English
price). A small sheaf of sermons deliv-
ered by their author in England and put
forth in book form to reach his friends
in Australia, Maoriland and elsewhere.
“Cluan”: Can anyone tell the identity
of “Robert Gray,” the author of Rufus
Stern, a Gippsland novel published a
couple of years ago? Some well-known
critics attribute the book to Mary Fullar-
ton, who has written so many books with
a Gippsland setting. I have always sus-
pected Miles Franklin. But could she
give us such lush sentimentality as that'
of the youth who stealthily went out in
the moonlight and kissed the bracken on
which the beloved girl had sat when he
first saw her?
W. E. Fitz Henry, who has been 17
years with The Bulletin —he looks after
the Service Department and acts as a
sort of liaison officer between the editor
and the outside contributor —will publish
within the next few weeks The Austra-
lian Authors and Artists’ Handbook. A
reference book for those who earn their
living or make cigarette money by writ-
ing or dabbling in black-and-white art, it
gives lists of markets, requirements in
the newspaper, book-publishing, radio,
motion-picture and music-publishing
fields, and about a score of articles of
interest to freelance writers and artists
contributed by various well-known
authorities. Price half a crown.
A Choice of Verse:—
SHE WENT HER WAY.
Under the cool willows
A barefoot maiden sat,
And the pinp of her toes
Laughed at fehoshaphat.
The sly wind teased her hair
And pulled it free and wild,
And 1, who watched her there,
Became at heart a child.
She sat and hummed a tune ;
Her parted lips were red
As love beneath the moon,
And all my pain fell dead.
Her eyes were blue sea-mist,
And like a rose her mouth,
And in my thought I pissed
Her fingers for my drouth.
The overleaning spy
Was luminous of her,
Her hands slept limp and nigh
In the soft lap of her.
She rose and walped away;
With song still on her lips
Went on her barefoot way,
Slim grasses at her hips.

WHAT’S TWENTY MILLION?
Mr. Lyons is keen on a conference of
Premiers and Ministers and Commis-
sioners of Railways to discuss unifica-
tion of railway gauges as an unemployed-
relief measure. It was to have been
held this month, but has been postponed
till January. If the idea, as published,
is to spend “about £21,000,000,” which
“would give work to about 15,000 men
for about eight years,” a further post-
ponement is recommended —the Greek
Kalends would be a suitable date.
Tasmania is out of the picture, though
it would be responsible for part of the
cost. The mainland has over 26,000
miles of railway—l3,ooo miles of 3ft. 6in.
gauge owned by Queensland, S. Australia,
W.A. and the Commonwealth ; 7222
miles of 4ft. gauge owned by the
Commonwealth and N.S.W., and 6050
miles of sft. 3in. gauge in Victoria and
S.A. Before unemployed-relief was
thought of, the main excuse for unifying
the gauges was defence. The Defence
Council was in favor of it, but there has
been no meeting of the Defence Council
since 1929.
A 1921 Royal Commission estimated
that unification would cost £21,600,000.
Another Royal Commission, reporting in
1929, placed the figure at £25,201,000.
At that time capital expenditure on Gov-
ernment lines had mounted £83,000,000
in seven years, so the figure must have
seemed a bagatelle. The 1929 commission
averred that had unification been com-
menced earlier a good deal of this money
would have been “included in the
scheme.”
The Commonwealth, having already de-
veloped a policy that the gauge for recon-
struction would be 4ft. Biin., financed
the building of 94i miles on that
gauge from Kyogle to Brisbane. One-
fifth of the amount was to become a
Federal liability and four-fifths the pigeon
of the mainland States on a population
basis. Profits were to cover interest.
Victoria, S.A. and W.A. refused to have
anything to do with the business, and
their responsibilities fell back on the
Commonwealth, which is now, jointly
with N.S.W. and Queensland, carrying
an interest burden of £200,000 p.a. on an
expenditure of £4,500,000. The loss is
roughly £50,000 a year, apart from the
effect on the old mail-route via Wallan-
garra. This is not encouraging. And
thought of the additional capital needed
to unify branch lines, many of which are
losing tens of thousands a year, makes
one shudder.
The Commonwealth’s 3ft. 6in. line in
Central Australia .lost £207,900 in three
years, 1930-33, on earnings of £360,700.
Its North Australia line lost £85,700 on
earnings of £107,500, both sets of figures
excluding interest. If these lines (1087
miles), which have already cost over
£7,000,000, were widened, the result can
be imagined.
The capital investment in Australian
railways is £325,000,000 —about one-
fourth of the national debt. For the
11 years to June, 1933, admitted losses
amounted to £52,805,000. Since little or
nothing was debited to depreciation, the
real total was considerably greater.
No railway of importance has been built
in Europe for more than a generation.
The chances are that no more rail-
ways will be built there or in the
U.S.A., where for a decade towns with
populations of up to 50,000 have sub-
sisted with no external communication
except highways. The road train has
arrived ; a successful experiment with it
has been made in the Commonwealth’s
own territory of Centralia. Australian
railway departments have long since
come to the conclusion that they dare
not let privately-owned motor services
compete with them.
The Commonwealth Government is
nevertheless committed to the completion
of the North-South railway. It will have
to bridge the gap between Alice Springs
and Daly Waters or offer South Australia
a satisfactory equivalent. There is no
objection to its discussing with the main-
land States the connecting of the five
on the one gauge—it would mean
4ft. B|in. lengths from Kalgoorlie to
Perth, Port Augusta to Broken Hill and
Tocumwal to Melbourne—in this con-
nection exploring the possibilities of the
third rail. But in an age which is wit-
nessing such revolutionary developments
in transport by road and air, and such
tremendous railway deficits everywhere,
railway construction should have lost
some of its old lure even for politicians.
Every railway-building proposal must be
examined with full regard to those de-
velopments and losses. A programme in-
volving a Commonwealth expenditure of
£20,000,000 or more —probably more —
does not deserve a moment's considera-
tion.
AUSTRALIAN AND ALIEN JEWS.
Australia has hitherto been free from
anti-Semitism in any shape or form. In
most countries there are disadvantages in
being a Jew ; in Australia there have been
none ; on the contrary, Australian-born
Jews competing for high positions with
Australians of British descent have occa-
sionally found their race an asset. And
it mattered not whether their fathers
came from England, France, Germany,
Poland or Russia. One Jewish-Austra-
lian of commanding talents became gen-
eral of the 4th Brigade in Gallipoli, of
the 3rd Division in Flanders, and finally
leader of the Australian Army on the
Western Front. Another has been Vic-
torian Solicitor-General and Attorney-
General, original member of the Com-
monwealth Parliament and Attorney-
General, High Court Justice, Chief Jus-
tice and the first native-born Governor-
General.
These distinctions were fairly earned,
and the appointments have been justified.
Had there been any feeling against Jews
on the part of the 99 per cent, of British-
Australians they could not have been
made. Unfortunately, there is some feel-
ing now. It has not gone deep, and may
be only a passing phase, but it exists. It
has been introduced from Britain by
sympathisers with Fascist movements
there and readers of newspapers like the
“Morning Post,” from Germany by
apologists for the Nazi persecution. It
is aroused by the exuberant racial pro-
paganda of Jewish writers and moving-
picture magnates. Most Australians
acquainted with the facts of history
merely smile at films like the one show-
ing Nathan Rothschild winning the
Waterloo campaign, but there are others
who resent them. Many more resent
the impertinences of Herr Kisch.
The visit of Herr Kisch is a very un-
happy chapter in the story of the Jews
in Australia. Coming to Australia to
campaign for the Communist anti-war
stunt, Herr Kisch was refused its hospi-,
tality, as he had been refused that of
tolerant Britain —obviously for good and
sufficient reasons. Instead of behaving
like the gentleman Osmond Esmond
showed himself in corresponding circum-
stances, this international Jew went on
as if Australia were a tenth-rate Tartar
colony temporarily under Menshevist
control —landed in spite of the Common-
wealth, challenged its right to expel him
and took advantage of a weakness of
the law to blither for the crew which
demands that Australia should disarm,
while applauding Russia for arming to
the teeth. In all these proceedings he
had the sympathy and assistance of
Jews.
It has set Australians recalling that
Jewish names are rather common
on Communist lists published in these
parts. They have also remarked that
the returned traveller who, on the
strength of a few days in Moscow, rushes
to reporters with the news that Russia
is a marvellous country ruled by super-
men, while Australia is a poor, backward
land, is often a Jew. If these persons
really believe that Russia is a better
place to live in than the Common-
wealth they are welcome to go back
to it. Australia will not detain them.
Perhaps Australia needs no protection
from foreign Jews who meddle in its
affairs or local Jews who are Commun-
ists first and Australians a long way
after. But they can do it harm
indirectly, besides doing individuals an
injury, by exciting prejudice against Jews
who are good Australians. Witness the
opposition in his electorate to Daniel
Levy, the veteran Speaker of the N. S.
Wales Legislative Assembly. Unworthy
as it is of the U.A.P., it would have
been unthinkable before Communism
tried to thrust on us its Kisch of peace.
IN FREEDOM’S NAME.
One of the paradoxes of a muddled age
is that in every constitutional country
Communists and Fascists are standing
up for freedom of speech. Australians
who never heard of Kisch and Griffin
before last month are scandalised be-
cause the authorities have tried to pre-
vent these intruders from propaganding
on behalf of Sovietism. In England the
Mosleyites, who want to abolish Parlia-
ment claim the alleged right to per-
suade others —including soldiers and
sailors —to adopt their policy. In France
they have the Fascist Croix de Feu on
one side and the Communist United
Front on the other, each arguing that the
Constitution must be overthrown and
each insisting on the right to orate about
overthrowing it.
Fascism and Communism aim at the
same thing, and their methods of pur-
suing their aims are essentially the same.
Both reject “palliatives.” Their theory
is that gradualism—reform by instal-
ments, constitutional reform —has failed ;
that there must be revolutionary changes,
and that they can only be achieved after
absolute power has been seized by a
class. The Communists —Pollitt in Eng-
land, Blum and Cachin in France.
Kisch here—preach disarmament, though
Russia has an enormous army and air
force; it is difficult to overthrow a
modern Government with an army or
navy in being.
The Fascists —Sir Oswald Mosley in
England, Colonel La Roque in France —
favor “law-and-order brigades.” These
formations are supposed to be for the
purpose of maintaining free speech at
public meetings—“even to the extent,” to
quote a Sydney New Guard leader, “of
giving someone a push in the face now
and again.”
Once a Fascist or Communist tyranny
is established by apostles of free speech,
free speech goes. So does every other
kind of freedom. Herr Kisch happens to
be here as a refugee from Hitlerism ; he
might equally, like Herr Bronstein (better
known as Trotsky), be a refugee from
Stalinism. After 16 years of Soviet gov-
ernment “purges” are still occurring in
which political offenders are executed in
batches a few minutes after what are
virtually drumhead courts-martial.
If these enemies of liberty had done
anything to add to the sum of human
happiness it might be some justification
for the blood they have shed ; but as
national saviors they have been failures,
relatively to the politicians of constitu-
tional countries. British Laborites keep
going to Russia in a spirit of hopeful-
ness, and returning in despair. The bulk
of the inhabitartts are underfed; the
main difference between existing condi-
tions and conditions under the Czar is
that it is more dangerous now to com-
plain. The Italians, after 12 years of
Fascism, have more soldiers and ’planes
but less to eat, and there is talk of the
lira being devaluated again ; but nobody
living in Italy dares to object. Freedom
has been officially proclaimed dead there.
As for Germany, for a variety of rea-
sons, many of which are unconnected
with the Versailles Treaty, the people
generally are more wretched than at any
time since the Dark Ages.
The real objection to all these tyrants
is not that they are tyrants, but that they
can’t deliver the goods. Neither the Rus-
sians nor the Italians would have minded
being robbed of free speech if their
masters had been able to organise their
food supplies. The intolerable feature
of both Fascism and Communism is that
the people suffer owing to the rule of in-
competents, and are debarred, under pain
of sudden death, from proclaiming their
grievances.
It is natural, in fact inevitable, that,
with the world in its present chaotic
state, there should be an unprecedented
number of loons eager to take charge
of the ship of State. How absurd if,
during a storm at sea, some irresponsible
announced that he meant to depose the
captain, and argued eloquently that for
the captain or anybody else to object
would amount to an interference with
the liberty of the subject! Particularly
if the mutineer let it be known, as every
Fascist and Communist does, that, in the
event of a change of control, no criti-
cisms would be allowed from the dis-
possessed sections. What Herr Kisch,
Sir Oswald Mosley and their supporters
are having the supreme effrontery to do
is to invoke the protection of Liberty in
the only countries where the lady is still
definitely alive, so that they may be given
a chance to transform her into what
Mussolini called “a festering corpse.”
NEUROSIS AND ATHLETICS.
In the days of our fathers, before ath-
letics had developed into a science, the
athlete was a red-blooded he-man,
usually regarded as being short in men-
tality and deficient in the finer feelings.
To-day, as far as certain sports are con-
cerned, he is a shrinking violet, as petu-
lant as a hysterical schoolgirl of the
mid-Victorian days, liable to sudden
attacks of the vapors and threatening to
swoon if any rude person makes un-
called-for remarks.
The trouble is that he has become
deified. The old-time athlete was
unknown outside his acquaintances.
The suburb in which he played was
his world. The latter-day athlete of
similar calibre enjoys a world-repu-
tation. His movements are cabled
to the ends of the earth. He is the idol
of all who know him, and he suffers
anguish if he strays into company that
knows not his sport and his reputation,
and is treated as an ordinary citizen.
The struggling actor suffers from no
temperamental disabilities. He is always
on time for rehearsals, is letter-perfect in
his lines and is careful about the way he
spends his three or four pounds a week.
But let that actor make a hit, and in-
stantly he becomes temperamental. He
slips up his manager, his colleagues and
his public. He owes money everywhere.
He is apt to throw a fit or go into a
paroxysm of fury if he is not accorded
the respect which he regards as his due.
In the language of the rude and uncul-
tured, he has swelled-head.
The modern athlete is similarly
afflicted with that dread complaint—
cerebral hypertrophy, the wise it call.
He must carry out the sacred ritual of
his religion with the worshippers bare-
headed and reverent. He is above criti-
cism. No ribald tongue must desecrate
the sanctity of his movements.
Certain foreign tennis-players became
exceedingly annoyed because they were
not permitted to carry out their muscular
evolutions in a holy silence befitting the
magnificence of the occasion. The igno-
rant Brisbane crowd which failed to
recognise that a tennis match was sacro-
sanct was moved to make rude remarks.
One Brisbane baby even had the bad
taste to cry. This was too much for
one tennis-player. He ceased playing and
demanded the removal of the offending
infant.
There is a type of cricketer so sensi-
tive that the observation of a small boy
over the fence is sufficient to put him
off his game. The golfer is another of
the sensitive plants. When the big boys
of golf reach the putting greens the
silence of the dead is required of on-
lookers lest the slightest sound should
make the player mishit.
There are exceptions, however. Joe
Ezar is one. In Melbourne Ezar violated
all the traditions by jollying the crdWd
and cracking jokes while he was on the
putting-green, and he put in just as many
balls as his more dignified opponents.
Pugilists are not thin-skinned. Though
barrackers yell their advice and their
criticism across the ropes there is no
record of any pug having burst into tears
and collapsed because some supporter of
the other man questioned his legitimacy.
He bogs in with renewed vigor.
Barracking is part of football all the
world over. The game is carried on in
a babel of cheers and abuse, for feeling
runs high and people say things over
the fence of a football ground that they
don’t mean. But nobody ever hears a
footballer whine that somebody put him
off his game by saying a rude thing.
If there is any man who requires a maxi-
mum of concentration and a freedom
from interference, physical or mental, it
is the footballer who has a shot at goal.
Everything depends on his success. A
deviation of a hairbreadth on the part
of any muscle, any interruption of his
mental process directed on aiming for
the goal, will spoil his effort. But the
real player hears nothing, sees nothing,
thinks of nothing but putting the ball
through those two sticks or over the
bar. The barracker has not the slightest
influence on the result.
Modern publicity has invested the ath-
lete —or some of him —with a superiority
complex which was formerly a mon-
opoly of the actor and the newly-made
knight. It would improve athletics gen-
erally were the big clubs to secure re-
cords from some of the most raucous
and offensive barrackers Australia can
boast, fit them in loud-speakers and make
every aspirant for international honors
pass a rigorous test. If athletics are to
have a public appeal, barracking is part
of the game. Those who can’t stand it
should stand down.
MONTAGUE GROVER.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Nation’s Business.
The Commonwealth Parliament has
adjourned for Christmas after the now-
familiar subordination of the nation’s
business to the private convenience of
members. Last year it met on October
6, left urgent matters like farm-relief
to the last moment in December, and
in its haste to rise for Christmas passed
19 bills in four days, among them Old-
age Pensions, Fruitgrowers’ Relief,
Wheatgrowers’ Relief, State Grants and
Dairy Produce—regulating inter-State
transfers of butter and involving consti-
tutional points.
Having hustled these measures
through, Parliament adjourned for seven
months—till June 28. Then it held a win-
dow-dressing session (it sat for 13 days),
adjourned on August 2, reassembled on
October 23, adjourned till October 29,
started on the Address-in-Reply, and had
another 12 days’ respite to enable Mr.
Lyons to arrive at an understanding with
Dr. Page. Then it dealt hurriedly with
a loan bill, spent hours on Mr. Kisch
and the case of an ejected war-service
home tenant, and began tackling the
Budget. Once “Hansard” had to record:
Further remarks were inaudible owing
to the disorder.
Seven more sittings brought proceed-
ings to December, with the estimates and
unemployment untouched. Mr. Lyons
announced that the estimates would be
dealt with in 12} hours—one hour for
the Territories, three-quarters of an hour
for the Post Office, three-quarters of an
hour for the Commonwealth railways.
The House kept to this schedule.
Wheat-relief and flour-tax legislation
involving the raising and spending of
£4,000,000 was passed in the demented
1933 fashion. An hour or so was spared
for tariff “reform” of a sort. Sanction
was demanded for a hurriedly impro-
vised unemployed-relief scheme, one in-
stalment being introduced without a
schedule of works. Chroniclers mention
that “disorderly scenes” occurred and
“extraordinary positions” arose.
The Senate had been standing by all
the session with nothing but trivialities
to occupy it. By sitting from Thursday
afternoon till three o’clock on Friday
morning, it made a show of discharging
its function as a House of Review. Re-
freshed by two or three hours of slumber
it assembled again and passed half a
dozen contentious bills “practically with-
out debate.”
This kind of thing makes the best
friends of Parliamentary government de-
spair and its worst enemies rejoice.
The Achievement of Albury.
Australians have had cause to revise
opinions of the Dutch influenced by
memories of Canning’s “Political Dis-
patch” : —•
In matters of commerce, the fault of the Dutch
Is offering too little and asking too much.
In these days of economic nationalism
most people are like that; but, if the gibe
remains applicable to the modern Hol-
landers, in other matters they are dif-
ferent.
In the affair of the airliner which,
wandering above the Murray and the
mountains on a wild night, with her
petrol-tanks emptying, was saved from
probable destruction by Albury people—
forming a circle with lighted cars, they
improvised a safe landing-ground on the
racecourse —the gratitude and generosity
of the Dutch have been rather over-
whelming.
The early enthusiasm evoked in Hol-
land and the Dutch colonies by the
rescue of Parmentier and Moll, their pas-
sengers and crew, has been here men-
tioned. It proved no ephemeral out-
burst. The airline company’s donation
of £2OO to the Albury hospital was fol-
lowed by the arrival of a delegation from
the Dutch East Indies with a gold-
mounted gavel for Mayor Waugh, and
gold and silver cigarette-cases for Albury
residents who gave special assistance on
the night of October 23, together with
£2O in each case. It also bore cheques
for £2OO for distribution among the
motorists and helpers at the racecourse.
The Mayor of Albury has been
made an officer of the Order of
Orange-Nassau, “which, in Holland, is
one degree higher than a knighthood.”
And every mail from the Netherlands
and the Dutch East Indies has brought
bushels of complimentary letters from
representative bodies and private indi-
viduals. In fact, Albury has become
better known to Dutch people at home
and abroad than any of the capital cities.
“Australia needs to advertise,” it is
said with wearisome iteration. Such
deeds as that of the Albury people give
it a finer and more enduring advertise-
ment than any money could buy. Not
that the credit for the saving of the Dutch
airliner should be assigned to Albury
alone. A.B.C. men and radio amateurs
helped, and the people of a dozen
towns about the Murray were on the
watch that night. If put to the proof
any one of them might have done what
it was reserved for Albury to do.
A fine breed of Australians is growing
up in the Murray valley. There may be
more fertile river regions in other con-
tinents, but there is none healthier: it
has no malaria and no hookworm ; no
negro belts and no poor whites. It is
destined to be a region of great States.

A Loop for Melbourne.
Once more Melbourne is floundering
over its traffic problems, and once more
the elimination of trams from Collins-
street is demanded. Traffic reformers
might study the manner in which Chicago
has overcome the difficulty.
The homicidal city keeps all trams out
of the central areas. Whether a line
serves north, south, east or west, it has
to circle round what is known as the
Loop district before it starts on its on-
ward journey.
The outside streets are naturally con-
gested with trams ; there is no room for
any other traffic except alongside the
procession of cars. But Chicago arranges
its traffic on that basis, realising that it
is impossible to have it both ways. The
streets inside the loop have no trams,
and, for a city of its size and population,
are remarkably free and open.
Melbourne could easily apply the same
principle. The only difficulty is presented
by Swanston-street, which provides the
only central outlet for the vast popula-
tion south of the Yarra. It would thus
be necessary to retain the trams in
Swanston-street, but the rest of the
metropolis could easily be served by a
loop enclosing the area contained in
Flinders, William, Lonsdale and Spring
streets. If Melbourne’s population be-
came too large for such a scheme to
serve, the boundaries might be enlarged
to Latrobe and «King streets, leaving the
central part of the city to be served by
motor traffic.
Chicago also reduces car-parking to
a minimum by the ingenious device of
building all its bridges hollow. The abut-
ments of the bridges are of steel —not
solid, as are Australian abutments —the
space being available for parking. In
addition, Chicago found it advisable to
raise the level of one of its streets to that
of an adjacent one. The hollow was not
filled, but the new street was erected on
steel columns, leaving an immense area,
two-storeys high, in which thousands
of cars are left during the day. Mel-
bourne, unfortunately, has no steep hills
which could be bridged. All its city
bridges have been so long erected with
solid abutments. But the clearing of the
trams from the central city would make
the present parking evil a mere bagatelle.

Exit the Golden Jests.
The Bulletin is glad to say that the
N. S. Wales Charitable Collections Bill
has been altered for the better. If it is
passed in its present form, the Golden
Jest type of promoter will, as a Christmas-
box, receive the order of the boot.
Other than churches collecting for
religious purposes and the Sydney Uni-
versity, all charities will need to be
registered. The governing bodies will
be made responsible for their proper
conduct; their proceedings at meetings,
their banking, trust arrangements and
methods are all to be carefully regu-
lated.
Conditions under which they may
appeal from house-to-house, display of
collection-boxes and sale of buttons and
tokens will be controlled. The whole
range of money-raising, from word-of-
mouth appeals to “art unions,” will be
placed under a single department, and
at least 60 per cent, of gross takings
must be applied to the object or institu-
tion which is supposed to benefit.
Hitherto there has been a great deal of
supposition about it.
In certain circumstances, the Minister
may waive the percentage provisions;
but he must lay a report on the table of
Parliament explaining his reasons. He
will have power of audit and of inquiry.
For offences under the bill, penalties will
range from a fine of £5O to five years’
imprisonment.
The sale of shares in State lottery
tickets is prohibited to agents, though
private syndicates may be formed. The
Minister will be able to deregister con-
cems which have been registered, and
will acquire rights of entry upon their
premises. He will be able to attach
their funds —even pending an appeal to
the Courts from his decisions.
Mr. Stevens himself has sponsored the
bill, and has expressed the determination
to wipe out pests whose collection opera-
tions have made N. S. Wales notorious
during the past couple of years. He
is to be congratulated on the thorough-
ness with which he has done the job.

Kite-flying over Papua.
With the knighting of Charles Marr the
report that the surplus Commonwealth
Minister will succeed Hubert Murray as
Lieut.-Governor and Chief Judicial Offi-
cer of Papua has cropped up again. Mr.
Marr is a very affable politician, but
he can know nothing of the handling of
Papuan or any other natives. The present
Lieut.-Governor has set a standard in
this respect which is a model for the
world, and it is essential to Australia’s
good name that his work should be
carried on.
Hubert Murray’s logical successor is
Administrator Pinney, of Norfolk Island.
Pinney, in addition to serving with dis-
tinction as a combatant in the World
War, was trained by Murray and knows
the territory as well as any white man
of his age. Failing Pinney, there are at
least three senior officials in the Man-
dated Territory and Papua who would
bring long experience to bear on this im-
portant position, and could be trusted to
fill it with skill and dignity.
One way to estimate Mr. Marr’s suita-
bility as a successor to Murray is to ask
whether he would have got so much as
a passing thought if he had not been a
faithful party man whom the Govern-
ment is anxious to reward.

The Tame Tiger in the Home.
During the past fortnight eight people in
Australia have met their deaths from
electric shock. In each case, the victims
would have escaped had they possessed
an elementary knowledge of electricity
and the dangers which it carries in the
event of minor dislocations.
The vast majority of people regard an
electric wire as they do a water-pipe—
something to serve their purposes ; it is
only when wind or rain or accident dis-
lodges a wire and lets Death loose to
wander in unaccustomed places that they
realise the dangers inherent in this valu-
able but untrustworthy servant of civili-
sation.
The teaching of elementary electricity
should be part of the curriculum of every
school. By the time the children of
to-day are men and women, electricity
may accomplish most of the work of
the world. The men and women them-
selves will become pressers of buttons,
operators of switches. From an economic
standpoint alone the need for' electrical
education is essential for the near future.
It is not so long since the man who
could use a telephone was a rarity. To-
day the applicant for almost any job
would drop many per cent, in the eyes
of his potential employer if he admitted
that he did not know how.
Twenty years ahead a smattering of
electrical knowledge will be as necessary
as the ability to read and write is now.
The duty of education is to make provi-
sion for the future ; and, in making pro-
vision for the future, the schools will be
ensuring the safety of the present.
Numbers of very small children have al-
ready learnt that if they see a loose wire
lying in the street they should give it a
wide berth and inform their elders. There
is now little danger to be anticipated
from the visible wire; the possibility of
broken wires which are hidden from view
still remains, and if children—grown
people, too —knew that after any dis-
turbance every galvanised-iron roof,
every foot of fencing wire may carry a
possible death ray, valuable lives might
be saved.
The average man or woman will shiver
with fright at the sight of a snake ; many
of these same people will cheerfully en-
deavor to repair electric apparatus with
metal tools. Everybody must be made
to realise that electrical power in a house
or a farm or on a road means that a
tame tiger is doing infinitely hard work
for their benefit. But they must also
realise that it is a tiger, and that their
lives are in jeopardy the moment it
breaks from its cage.

Skimping the C.S.I.R.
The C.5.1.R., which was placed on a per-
manent basis by the Commonwealth in
1920, is a useful body of which the
public hears little. Its staff of 121
research workers and 85 laboratory assis-
tants and technical men and women has
given good value for the pay it has re-
ceived. In each State there are expert
committees on which men like R. D.
Watt, E. C. Andrews, W. J. Dakin, Her-
bert Gepp, Charles Martin and a host
more give advisory services.
As a result of the council’s prickly-
pear research Cactoblastis has brought
millions of acres back to production.
Its investigations of animal and fruit
and plant pests and diseases, timber and
tobacco problems, food transport diffi-
culties, acclimatisation, soils and fertil-
isers havp been of enormous value.
Yet the director, whose illuminating
paper on gold and the national debt
pointed a road towards employment and
recovery which the Government has since
started to follow, has to complain of the
“lack of adequate assistance from the
Commonwealth Government.” The coun-
cil declares that' it is impracticable on
the money available to provide for ac-
tivities of first-class importance.
Actually, the vote has been increased
for 1934-35 from £72,519 to £104,000;
but' in 1928-29, when there were fewer
problems calling for urgent attention, it
was £160,000. Contributions from private
sources amounted in 1932-33 to £56,672
to cover the cost' of special inquiries. A
total of £160,000 from Federal Govern-
ment and private sources is little enough
to expend on such a purpose.
The Commonwealth can find money
for other objects. Its Taxation Depart-
ment, for example, was voted £411,115
to run itself in 1928-29. It employed 620
permanent and a couple of dozen tem-
porary officials. It cost £500,122 last
year, is to cost £526,000 this year and
proposes to increase its staff from 940 to
958.
Mr. Lyons might well ask his Treasury
to transfer the cost of a few of the clutch-
ing hands to feed the C.5.1.R., whose
work helps to provide more fodder to
keep taxation departments sleek.

Those 9.2’5.
Australia is about to acquire some 9.2
guns, which will be mounted at Sydney,
Fremantle and elsewhere. They will
make the areas which they command im-
mune from attack by enemy warships—
so long as nothing happens to them.
It would be an enemy’s business to
see that something did happen, and that
soon. Take the position of Sydney in
the event of Britain becoming involved
in war in the Pacific. And, world condi-
tions being what they are, war in the
Pacific is a dread possibility, and it would
be impossible for Australia to keep out
of it.
When war broke out the R.A.N.
cruisers might be at Hobart, Fremantle,
anywhere. Two great Pacific Powers
have harbors within a couple of thou-
sand miles of the N. S. Wales coast from
which warships could issue without
attracting attention. Assume an enemy
got a landing party of, say, 500 ashore
near Sydney. The entire Commonwealth
defence force consists roughly of 250
staff officers, about double' as many
n.c.os. (mostly employed on instructional
and clerical duties), some garrison gun-
ners and the militia. In any one capital
there are not enough trained men to re-
sist so much as a company of properly
equipped shock troops.
In the event of a landing party putting
the 9.2 out of action the invading vessels
could stand off and blockade the city.
The State’s overseas trade would be para-
lysed till the R.N. was able to come to
the rescue, and it might never be able
to do so. For the R.N., it would not be
a matter of detaching a ship or two from
Singapore, but of defeating the enemy in
a decisive battle.
The obvious corollary of a 9.2 gun is
a force capable of protecting it. The
minimum needed for the protection of
the guns which we are acquiring is prob-
ably a brigade of regulars—approxi-
mately a battalion for each strategic
centre. The officers and other ranks
would, of course, be picked men —equiva-
lents of those who composed the crack
battalions of the A.I.F. in 1918.
The function of such a unit would not
only be to insure the safety of the capi-
tals. At present our citizen soldiers are
working in the dark ; they have no stan-
dards of comparison. The brigade would
be worth anything it might cost in the
long run, as an object-lesson in efficiency
and morale.
In any event, Australia will have to
invest in something of the sort after the
9.2’s are installed. Not to do so would be
national suicide.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“M. Turlutu”: Parliamentary oratory
in Queensland still provides some fine
mixed dishes of metaphor. A Govern-
ment supporter accused the Opposition
of “belaboring its joss in the hope that it
will come to light and wave the magic
wand.” An Opposition man darkly re-
ferred to an occasion on which “the
Unseen Hand said ‘No.’ ” One of his
colleagues described a bill as a wolf in
sheep’s clothing. “But,” he went on, “as
it unfurled itself we saw what it was.”
None of them, though, can equal Philip
Fysh in the early Federal days. “What
do I see?” the old Tasmanian bellowed
through his voluminous white whiskers
one night after a particularly lively
official dinner. “I see the Hand of
Destiny advancing with relentless tread
to plant the Flag of Empire in some
bright oasis amid the illimitable wastes of
the Southern Ocean.”

“Visitor”: The sky-line of Adelaide is
altering rapidly. It used to consist of two
towers, G.P.O. and Town Hall. Then
the T. and G. solid cube dwarfed them,
followed by Shell. The Colonial Mutual’s
pile, just opened, is of the tinted “Bene-
dict” synthetic stone from Queensland,
and is more ornamental, being castel-
lated, with steeply sloped tiled roofing,
in the upper regions, instead of remain-
ing cubical all the way up. The A.M.P.,
not to be left behind, is destroying, to
the general regret, its present handsome
brownstone three-storey home to erect
another skyscraper on the site. But
Adelaide limits all building height to
132 feet.

“Billy See”: Is there anything more
soulless than an Australian Government
department? The other day a Nor-
wegian whale-chaser blew into Fremantle
with a broken propeller and a packet of
letters collected from Tristan da Cunha,
the loneliest outpost of the Empire, far
down in the South Atlantic. Possessed of
neither money nor stamps the Tristans
have always been encouraged to believe
that any letter impressed with the seal
of the island will be delivered free by
any post office in the world. But the
Norwegian captain speedily learned that
Parkhfll’s department recognises no such
responsibility. Forwarded from Fre-
mantle to Perth the letters, a mere 40 in
all, were refused handling. Eventually
the Norwegian skipper paid the postage
out of his own pocket sooner than dis-
appoint the confiding islanders. Inci-
dentally, it is rather strange that the
British Government P.O. doesn’t issue
Tristan da Cunha stamps. Apart from
the need they would fill, how the phila-
telists would rush them!
“M. Turlutu”: One Brisbane boy is
disgusted with himself for having missed
a good show. Bathing at night, he got
back to the dressing-room after the lights
were out, couldn’t locate the locker where
he’d left his clothes, and sneaked home
in the altogether. The bath manager
found the clothes, notified the police, and
a busy night was spent in looking for the
body—which was sleeping happily at
home. When he turned up to inquire
for the clothes he was coldly received,
but not so coldly as at school, where he
was treated as a mug who couldn’t even
help at his own obsequies. Nothing can
hurt a boy more. Read “Tom Sawyer”
if you want to know how it feels.

“M.G.”: Melbourne police barracks
in Russell-street are to be demolished
and replaced with an up-to-date struc-
ture. To make more room for the en-
larged premises, two old private houses
in Latrobe-street have been bought. The
second of these is a historic mansion
of early Melbourne, occupied by Dr.
Barker when he was medical officer

of Melbourne Gaol. I had dinner at
Barker’s house on the day Ned Kelly was
hanged; sitting opposite me was
Dean O’Hea, who gave the bush-
ranger his spiritual send-off. I sat
open-mouthed as the doctor described the
scene on the scaffold and repeated Ned’s
last words, while the priest told the gath-
ering of a series of guillotinings he had
witnessed in Paris, illustrating the de-
scription with a table-knife and a rolled
serviette. I was a very small boy then,
and intensely interested, like other small
boys of the period, in the Kelly gang.

“D. 1.”: Gaelic is very far from being
a dead language (B. 5/12/’34), nor is it
only in the U.K. that it survives. There
is a colony at Esquelle, in Southern
Patagonia, where the people, descendants
of Welsh emigrants, speak nothing else
among themselves, and hold it their
mother-tongue. They “have no Eng-
lish,” though most of them can manage
a smattering of Spanish when strangers
happen along.

“Ida D.”: Having taught English to
foreigners in their own countries for a
number of years, I question “Lindley
M.’s” assertion (B. 5/12/’34) that a pass-
age in English dictation would stump an
alien undesirable, especially an educated
one. I think that an everyday conver-
sational test would have greater difficul-
ties for most of them. Most Continental
Europeans have a. bagful of languages,
and are grounded in English at school.
It is only when opportunity offers that
they take “conversation lessons.” Those
I taught were familiar with our classics,
and seldom made a mistake in spelling.
But their speech, for the first dozen les-
sons, was the speech of Macaulay’s and
Gibbon’s writings, with now and then a
Shakspearean phrase to eke out their
meaning.

“Still Older Q ”: Mention by “Old Q.”
(B. 12/12/’34) of the athletic prowess of
“Doctor” Jack Hamilton leads me to tell
with pride of an occasion on which I beat
him hands down. It was in the first con-
scription campaign in Brisbane. Some-
body had said something about rein-
forcements at Enoggera camp. The re-
inforcements came to town for a friendly
visit to the office of the “Daily Standard”
(the anti-conscription organ). They came
bearing gifts such as blue metal, old
eggs, tomatoes, flour-balls, debilitated
onions and mature potatoes. Said 1 to
Doctor as we watched proceedings from
the other side of the road: “There’s a
man with a revolver on that verandah.”
Said Doctor to me: “I think we are
quite safe here.” A bullet then struck
a paling a foot from my leg, and another
one smacked the pavement almost on
Doctor’s heel. When I looked back at the
Gresham corner he was only coming up
the straight, but he was an old man then.

“D.A.”: The Strathaird’s cruise to
Maoriland was a red-letter day in Auck-
land’s shipping register; thousands of
people lined the wharves to view the arri-
val of the largest liner ever seen in
Waitemata Harbor. The harbormaster
himself took on the job of piloting the
big ship down the channel, and Auck-
land’s only tug turned out to do its duty.
The time of tribulation came when the
tug, the pilot and the engine-room were
all doing their darnedest to get the craft
alongside the wharf, stern first or any
other way. • The tug broke its mast on
the Strathaird’s curved bows, and every-
body’s temper was frayed to snapping-
point when the passengers were eventu-
ally landed, 2\ hours late. The berthing
was the subject of a leader in next morn-
ing’s “N.Z. Herald”; but skipper and
pilot flatly refused any comment to local
newshounds.

“Medic” moralises:
Nature has encountered another setback in
her ceaseless effort to keep down populations—
this time at the hands of Sydney’s McMaster
Health Laboratory, which has discovered a
powder that immunises dogs from ticks. Canine
vital statistics show that, while the south side
of Sydney harbor has proliferated dogs, the
north side has been consistently under-dogged.
Ticks are to blame. They swarm in the
northern suburbs during the summer, but are
almost non-existent between George’s River
and the Circular Quay. A result of the new
discovery will be to double or treble the dog-
population in the thickly-inhabited Milson’s
Point-Hornsby-Barrenjoey-Manly area. The new
dog-generation won’t be the equal of the present,
whose members are either so healthy that ticks
can’t kill them or so valuable that their owners
constantly inspect them. In brief, North
Sydney is to be given an object-lesson in what
happens all over the world when science inter-
feres with the law of the jungle.
“Mr. Chucks”: I note with a certain
regret that the Admiralty has resolved to
abandon the old custom of naming war-
ships after mythological characters. Two
craft already named, the Minotaur and
Polyphemus, are to be rechristened, and
the rule will hold good for all new
vessels. Apart from the fact that these
names perpetuated in the navy the
memory of notable ships of other
days, there is the romantic side to con-
sider. It was on H.M.S. Bellerophon,
for one instance, that Napoleon sur-
rendered to the British. And what
about the legends clinging to the lovely
names of the no less lovely fri-
gates of the years of Nelson and his
contemporaries? Melpomene, Eurydice,
Euryalus, Arethusa—they run as musi-
cally as water down a hill. Their modern
equivalents are to be named after towns
like Glasgow and Birmingham.

“D.”: An odd example of the unex-
pectedness which characterises every cen-
sorship was the decision of the R.Cs. of
Moree (N.S.W.) to boycott “The Private
Life of Henry VIII.” (“It shows a man,
and a king at that, to be nothing but an
animal.”) Charles Laughton, who created
the part, is a product of England’s great-
est Jesuit school, Stonyhurst, and he and
his wife are practising Catholics. Rome
has nothing to defend Henry VIII. for;
furthermore, the film presents him as far
less bestial than Lingard and other Catho-
lic historians do. The only thing in the
film to the much-wedded monarch’s
detriment which historians, Catholic and
Protestant, haven’t stressed is the low
standard of his table manners. There is
no historical evidence that Henry tore
fowls to pieces with his hands and hurled
the gnawed remains over his shoulder ;
but, as forks weren’t in use in his time,
he no doubt did. Picnickers do it to this
day.

“Centurion”: Monash wasn’t the only
brass-hat who broke regulations in a
fashion which would have brought
trouble to lesser lights (B. 5/12/’34). Par-
ticular to the umptieth degree to see that
others stuck rigidly to the dress regula-
tions, Haig himself was never seen, even
on high ceremonial occasions, “properly
dressed” as regards his Sam Browne belt.
As long ago as the South African days,
when he was C.O.S. cavalry, Haig dis-
pensed with the shoulder-strap of the
harness. In every picture taken in France
I have seen of him he appears with the
simple girth round the waist and no sup-
porting shoulder-strap.

“Como”: Exasperating to the specu-
lator in land values is the way in which
the Naice People of Melbourne change
their minds regarding fashionable loca-
tions. Years ago, when the State Gov-
ernor was given a country home at Mace-
don, all Toorak sat up and took notice,
and Macedon land values soared sky-
high. But for some reason—probably
because Governors spent little time there
—a slump set in, and it is now possible
to get Macedon homes at bargain prices.
Portsea was the next spot chosen as the
Mecca of the exclusive, and land values
rose there. But the wealthy lower orders
began to crowd in, and there was an,
exodus to Frankston —a place with not
one-tenth the natural beauty and attrac-
tions of Portsea. A summer home at
Frankston is still a coveted possession,
but somebody discovered that its out-
skirts would be an ideal spot for
the world jamboree of Boy Scouts,
and by the time the summer is
going strong the neighborhood will be
filled with youngsters of all nationalities
and colors, and the Naice People will
be lost in the crush. Possibly Ouyen or
Mount Oliphant will be the next fashion-
able location.

“Jeames”: From “S. M. Herald”:
Colored gentleman desires situation as
houseman.
Another example of a word on the
rocky road to ruin. Sambo might have
offered himself as a housegentleman (we
already have charlady), but terminologi-
cal consistency is rare. “Me and the
gentleman in the dock,” began a wit-
ness at Sydney Quarter Sessions the other
day. As against which the maidens
whose toothy grins figure in our fashion
papers would sooner wear neck-to-knee
bathing-suits than refer to their male ac-
quaintances as anything but “men.” A cen-
tury ago “gentlemanly,” like “knightly,”
had an honorable connotation; now
gentlemanly is applied chiefly to beach
sheiks, while the knightly qualities con-
sist in those gifts for underground engin-
eering which earn politicians’ offsiders
K.B.Es. Some day “gentleman” will be
deemed insulting language and written
“g ”in the police court reports, the
same way as a noun which was once
used descriptively by high and low now
figures shamefacedly in print as “b
ROLLER-TOWELS.
“The Speaker of the House of Reps., replying to a
question, said that the roller-towel system had
been introduced in members’ toilet-rooms because
hundreds of hand-towels had been removed and the
cost of replacing them was heavy.”
“O tempora!” one well may groan, “O
mores !”
You would have reckoned these malignant,
coarse,
Shameful inventions, vile and baseless stones,
Coming from almost any other source.
It’s infinitely hard, I grant, to credit;
But since the Speaker, the accepted voice
In all relating to the House, has said it,
You haven’t any choice.
This liquid soap’s esteemed a fine invention,
A notable improvement on the cake,
In some establishments that 1 could mention,
Because it’s quite impossible to shake.
But oh! to think that chaps should make a
welter
Of souveniring unconsidered things
In those luxurious premises which shelter
Our six-and-seventy kings!
I wonder are the brushes chained securely
Or anchored down to bases firm, for fear
Lest they incontinently and obscurely
And inconsiderately disappear.
I wonder if, as cheerful mealtime passes,
The conscientious steward e’er forgets
To keep a rolling eye upon the glasses
And watch the serviettes.
Perish the thought! A single touch of nature
Proverbially makes the whole world kin.
Forgetful blokes outside the Legislature
One meets by scores —there must be some
within.
And many a man who wouldn’t dream of
“swiping”
May—absent-mindedness, of course, the
cause —
Pocket the article designed for wiping
His dripping face and paws.
No use in asking those whose high abode is
In halls where Federal history began
The question Quis custodiet custodes ?
Because it’s obvious that no one can.
But when your towels unknown hands are
looting
By scores and hundreds, you will surely find
There’s something to be said for substituting
Those of the roller kind.

T. THE R.


“F. 0.”: Allow me as one of the
“Temp. Gents.” referred to by “Jeames”
(B. 12/12/’34) to tell of a chastening ex-
perience of my own. Fairly well posted
in the conventions of the regulars, I was
at pains to drop my military moniker
when the piping times of peace descended
on us. One day, however, entering a pub
for the usual purpose, I was hailed by a
slightly-elevated friend who insisted on
introducing me to his companion, a uni-
formed naval warrant officer far gone in
liquor. Said my friend: “Let me intro-
duce W. O. Jones—Major Smythe.” The
inebriated mariner regarded me gravely
for a moment before delivering judgment.
“Major?” he hiccupped. “Shalvashun
Army, of courshe!”
* * * *
“A.F.”: Though I have a moderate
acquaintance with the French tongue an
advertisement in “S. M. Herald” grav-
elled me. A blatant picture-house—the one
that introduced those unhappy youths
decked up in comic-opera uniforms some
time ago—advertised for “attachettes” to
serve customers in a milk-bar it was
opening. The girls had to be “young
and of attractive appearance,” though I
cannot imagine the wildest milk-bibber
being carried away by a twinkling eye
or a neat ankle. I have no French dic-
tionary accessible, so cannot trace that
word. “Attache,” one knows, of course,
but I have never run across a feminine
form, real or spurious, in any of the
“Great Scott, a bootlace in the stew!”
written or spoken French to which I
have been exposed.
“Temp’rance” : Before 1934 passes out
it seems worth recording that it is the
centenary year of teetotalism. The word
“teetotal” first appeared in print in 1834
—in a Lancashire paper where a corre-
spondent signed himself “A Lover of
Sociality and a Tee-total Abstainer.” The
word seems to have been invented by one
Richard Turner, a Lancashire working
man, who died in 1846 ; the epitaph on
his tombstone at Preston makes the
claim.
* * * *
“Japhet”: James O’Grady, Governor
of the Falkland Islands, dead in London,
was almost if not quite the only true-
blue Laborite whom the Ramsay Mac.
Government appointed to represent the
Crown overseas. He somewhat dis-
gusted his comrades
by accepting readily
the knighthood that
goes with the job,
instead of waving it
aside. The O’Grady
probably did his job
in the Speck as well
as most Governors
and better than
some. A queer in-
cident preceded his
regime. When he
was on his way to
Hobart, an ancient
in the Old Men’s
Home at Perth claimed the new-made
knight as his long-lost son. His Ex.
rebutted the impeachment with some
asperity.
“A. de G.”: That paragraph about the
Russian “prince” (B. 5/12/’34) is a re-
minder that the alleged title is as com-
mon on the Continent as “Esq.” in Eng-
land and, save in a few notable instances,
regarded no more highly. In
France the destruction of records
in the Revolution gave would-be
princes an open go ; in Italy the
purchase of some tiny estate often
carries the title with it, as more
than one affluent Yank has found
out. Britain is the only country I know
of where princes are all of the blood
royal. On the Continent the supreme rank
below the sovereign—if there is one —is
usually duke. In Britain a duke heads
the peers, and that is all. Worth noting,
also, is that on the Continent every off-
shoot of a family ranked as “noble” is
noble. In Britain only peers and their
eldest sons enjoy that distinction. The
rest of the family are commoners, in
spite of courtesy titles.
rl= * H= *
“M. Turlutu”: Have just read the
obituary notice of the fifth friend be-
tween 55 and 65 whom I have lost this
year, apparently through the same cause.
All were healthy, robust men up to the
Brisbane ’flu epidemic of 1933, all got
it pretty severely, all tried to “shake it
off,” all developed a sort of mild heart
flutter a few months later which came
on at nights after a little extra exertion
during the day. There was no pain, no
particular inconvenience even; only
drowsiness and a sort of disinclination to
work. Three of them were told by the
doctors that the trouble was heart fibril-
losis ; the other two didn’t trouble to see
a doctor. All died suddenly and pain-
lessly. It seems to suggest a useful line
of inquiry in which the State and Com-
monwealth Health Departments might
combine for the purpose of tracing the
after-effects of this so-called ’flu, and
devising methods by which they can be
mitigated or avoided.

G. Trotter : The Bishop of London
has been denouncing stage nudity,
“And now I’d like to send a message to all those dear mothers who have
children”
As far as my experience goes, there
is no more nudity on the stages of Britain
or Australia than may be seen any day
on the beaches of both countries —cer-
tainly not so much as may be seen on
English foreshores. Travellers have a
way of exaggerating such spectacles.
Half the people who visit Paris will
assert that full nude displays are com-
mon at the Folies Bergeres and other
halls. I’ve visited Paris four times alto-
gether, and have been to the Folies Ber-
geres frequently ; yet I never .saw one
show with a full nude. Half-nudes
there are in plenty, but all the
figurantes wear something. The nudest
show I ever saw was that of the
Hoffman girls at Chicago five or six years
ago. They were attired in silver fig-
leaves and nothing else. They were all
wonderful artists —dancers, gymnasts and
acrobats —and all beautiful women.
After the first surprise their nudity was
forgotten.
“Oran”: Spurious coins? A dear old
lady of my acquaintance was stuck with
one the other day, and showed it inter-
estedly to her friends. A few
days later she announced agi-
tatedly that the worthless piece,
a florin, was missing from her
purse; in all innocence, she
must have passed it. Scorning
our facetious congratulations,,
she caught the next tram to
town. On her return she told
us she had been to the four
shops she had visited on the
day the dud florin disappeared.
No, she hadn’t made any inquiry about
it, but she had unostentatiously left a
good florin on each counter, the easiest
and pleasantest way of salving her con-
science.
* * * *
“Mells”: “General Prac.” asks (B.
12/12/’34) “Why did syphilis, imported
by the sailors of Columbus, ramp across
Europe when the Americas for aeons had
regarded it as nothing much worse than
a common cold?” If his premises are cor-
rect, the cause may be that it was on new
ground, where it flourished riotously for
a period. Nowadays, according to the
“Encyclopaedia Britannica,” syphilis in
the United Kingdom is “in the stage of
an epidemic in its decline ; with the soil
practically worn out, the organism grows
only in a stunted form.” It is conceiv-
able, surely, that such a stage might have
been reached in America centuries or
aeons before. Nevertheless, the theory
that syphilis was brought to Europe by
the sailors of Columbus is far from being
so widely held as it once was. Wynd-
ham Lewis, in his book on Francis
Villon, says that the French referred to
it as the maladie de Naples, but that it
almost certainly existed in the Old World
long before the Middle Ages. Aren’t
there stories of the preseived remains of
Egyptian kings showing traces of the
disease sufficient for medical science to
identify?
* * * *
“M.G.”: I learn that Melbourne R.Cs.
have formed a “League of Decency”
to consider questions affecting the
stage and the screen. The first and
foremost difficulty connected with any
censorship is that no two persons will
be found to agree, whether both are
what is known as “broad-minded” or
wowseristic. Some years back it was my
duty to study previews of films. With
me sat an elderly whiskered gentle-
man representing a church which owned
the hall where certain of the films weie
screened. Even pictures which passed
the Commonwealth and the State Censors,
were liable to be banned from exhibition
in this particular building. But I found
to my surprise that numbers of films I
regarded as objectionable—and I am a
rather free-and-easy individual belonging
to no denomination —were a source of
great amusement to the church censor,
and were accepted cheerfully by his col-
leagues. Others, which seemed to me
to be innocuous from the church
standpoint, he would pass, only to con-
fide in me a week later that he had been
hauled over the coals by the other elders.
Every individual has a different stand-
ard of decency.
* ❖ *l* t-
“Como": Not satisfied with the bag-
pipes, the ocarina, the Wurlitzer organ
and similar noisemakers, the musical in-
tellectuals of Melbourne are agitating
for a renaissance of pandean pipes,
which went out of fashion at the time of
the battle of Marathon. Even musical
students know nothing of pandean pipes
to-day. They are not even aware of the
reason for the two pipes, whether one
gives the treble notes and the other the
bass. Furthermore, if we are to accept
the authorities, pandean pipes need to be
played by persons who prance in a par-
ticular way, while the costume worn is
such that only duly-qualified members of
the Nudist Society would be eligible to
play.
* * * *
“Shep”: Reading in the Monash
memoirs about the review of the Third
Divvy by the King on Salisbury Plain,
I was reminded of the day when George
V. whizzed past us, on his tour of the
Somme, as we lined the Amiens-road
near Albert. We had marched miles on
that bleak morning to take up our posi-
tions, and were without greatcoats, the
mud having rendered these too disreput-
able for the C.O.’s liking. Orders had
told us we could cheer as the King drove
past, but we noticed no frantic outbursts
amongst further-back crowds as the lead-
ing car passed them. What we did
notice, though, was that, as the very last
car, 100 yards behind the rest, came
abreast of each mob, the cheers were
deafening and hats were thrown up in
the air. We were too interested in get-
ting our first glimpse of the King to re-
member the cheering part as he sped by,
but as the final car came along we were
ready to give our roars of welcome to
its occupants, whoever they might be.
It held a load of military Jacks! They
might have turned the joke back on us
by acknowledging the applause in the
usual manner, but they merely sat there,
glaring, as if wishing the whole A.l.f!
to Hades.
THE LIMIT.
“The N.S.W. Government has decided to prescribe
a regulation surfing costume—the irreducible mini-
mum to be worn by bathers of both sexes.”
No more shall wowsers shriek about decorum ;
Henceforth ’twill be the Government’s affair
To settle just what constitutes a quorum
In togs our surf-queens and our sand-sheiks
wear.
No more upon the sands shall plain and candid
Opinions be voiced in wrangles warm
As to the minimum of duds demanded
To adequately veil the human form.
No more shall beach inspectors at their pleasure
Warn off the too-audacious maids and males.
Each one presumably will carry a measure
Henceforth, and possibly a pair of scales.
They’ll scan a diagram and run a jigger
O’er any arguable belle or beau,
To see it carries, every glowing figure,
The statutory minimum of clo.
My oath! What issues vast, what questions
burning
The rulers of this sunny land must face,
In solemn state who daily sit concerning
The happiness and welfare of our race!
The destinies of nations now they’re shaping;
Anon they turn to tell us, all and each,
The irreducible amount of clothing
Required for maids and men upon the beach.

POLITICAL POINTS
Visiting the Doulton works the other
day, those grand old Westralian patriots
Colebatch (“b. Herefordshire”) and
McCallum Smith (“b. Inverness”) re-
ceived an appropriate gift for the coun-
try for which they are ready to dye in
the last ditch—a terra-cotta panel, “The
Prodigal Son.” Obviously Doultons have
heard of the chronic deficit and the hilari-
ous loan expenditure on the group settle-
ments, the Agricultural Bank, Herds-
man’s Lake and the Canning-road.
Another lot of war-debts payments was
due on December 9. Finland weighed in
with $228,538. John Bull, whose little
account was $117,600,600, sent his re-
grets. France said it would pay no more
till there had been “a general discussion
of a final general settlement.”
Nobody likes the Commonwealth flour
tax, which is to be £2 12s. 6d. a ton,
but it is a question of giving wheat-
growers a bounty or letting lots of them
go bung. As it is, vast stretches of coun-
try which used to be under wheat have
gone out of cultivation. The two Labor
factions demanded a compulsory pool,
which would be declared unconstitu-
tional immediately it was challenged,
and “a home-consumption price of 4s.
6d. a bushel.” Though the whole burden
of their home-consumption price would
fall on the bread-buyer (£2,500,000 of
the £4,000,000 required for the bounty is
to come out of general tax-revenue) they
profess to believe that it wouldn’t affect
him a bit.
Beasley, the hope of West Sydney, was
anxious to refuse the wheat bounty to
farmers who had taxable income last
year. With wheat at the price it was,
the earning of taxable income was proof
of energy and competence. To deny the
bounty to these good farmers would be
equivalent to depriving skilled workers
of the margins they get for skill.
Haled before a magistrate, a North
Queenslander said he had not voted at
the Commonwealth election because he
had “lost faith in Australia —party poli-
tics is sucking the lifeblood out of the
country.” He is now 16s. the poorer.
Some of the human causes of his disgust
should pause long enough in their ob-
jurgations to take a hat round for him.
Under a measure hitherto inoperative
the N.S.W. Stevens Government has
power to fix flour and bread prices, and
the provision expiring at the end of De-
cember has been extended for 12 months.
The Government, which has optimistic
moments, hopes to prevent the price of
bread rising in consequence of the Com-
monwealth flour tax. It would have a
better chance of effecting its purpose
if it forbade the sale of bread to indi-
vidual buyers except for cash. Bread
is too dear almost everywhere, but the
“bad pay” is a big factor in the price.
The secretary of a Melbourne club
has been fined £2O for permitting a “fruit
machine” to be on the club’s premises.
Which shows how old-fashioned Mel-
bourne is. Why, one of the first men
elected to the new N.S.W. Upper House
was a Sydney philanthropist who helped
to introduce “fruit machines”—the Hon.
T. C. Trautwein, M.L.C.
Europe had two Popes once, and Syd-
ney may yet have two Lud Mayors. The
newly-elected aldermen met to choose
one the other day, and retired in dis-
order when it was revealed that there
were 10 votes for Parker (Ind.) and 10
for Jackson (Civic Reform). In Perth
the ratepayers and occupiers elect the
Mayor, and he is called Mayor and no-
thing else. He has a vote as member of
the council and a casting-vote as Mayor,
so the business of the city—constantly
delayed in Sydney by “rescission motions”
and the like —is never held up. It is an
immeasurably better arrangement than
one which necessitates or admits of the
interposition of gentlemen like Mr. Syd-
ney Snow, of the U.A.P., and Mr.
Graves, of the Trades Hall.
Hankinson, M.L.A. for Murrum-
bidgee, said a good thing in the N.S.W.
Assembly:
Politics to-day are too much bound up
with telling us what we ought to do with
other people’s money.
Then, being a politician, Mr. Hankinson
made impassioned speeches about the
need for helping Murrumbidgee settlers
with other people’s money.
When the negotiations for an Aus-
tralia-Maoriland trade agreement had
come to a standstill nature intervened. It
drowned the potato crops in Koo-wee-rup
and other parts of Victoria, and, though
the damage was not so great as early
reports made out, it was sufficient to
bring the negotiators together again. A
potato quota had been demanded by the
M.L. delegates and refused. “We have
been sacrificed on the altar of the
potato,” said an infuriated N.S.W.
orange-grower in a tremendous figure of
speech.
Australia is a big buyer of timber fox-
boxes and cases, and gets a lot from the
U.S.A. In a year or two Maoriland will
be a seller, and as its softwoods planta-
BREAKING-UP.
tions mature it will be able to keep pace
with' a demand that is sure to increase.
This does not seem to have occurred to
the gentlemen from Canberra and Wel-
lington who have been babbling about a
trade agreement and are to meet again in
March. As far as the public has been
permitted to learn, their discussions have
been confined to oranges and potatoes.
J. C. Willcock, the Westralian Minister
of Justice—like Comrade Mullan, the
Queensland Attorney-General, he is a
layman—mentioned the other day that
the High Court had lately heard five
appeals against judgments of his State’s
Full Court and had upheld four. He
offered no comment, but no doubt the
unsuccessful litigants attended to that.
N. S. Wales has acquired another 1234
Jay Pays, bringing the total up to 28,000.
The roll has doubled since 1922. If the
present rate of increase keeps up every
male adult in N. S. Wales will be a
magistrate in a.d. 2050.
A Westralian Leg. Council committee
has been considering the case of Gray,
the Labor M.L.C. who virtually for-
feited his seat by committing a gross
breach of the Electoral Act and was
pardoned by the Lieut-Gov. at his Gov-
ernment’s instance. It reports that the
Chamber can, if it chooses, send Gray
back to his constituents. Well, why
doesn’t it choose?
About the gamest man in politics is
Thomas, M.L.A. for the Sydney suburb
of Bondi, in which there axe many more
women electors than men. He proposes
equal pay for the sexes, so that men may
be preferred to women. Thomas sees
in “the limiting of females in industry”
the main hope for workless men, and he
quotes the dictum of the maker of Austin
cars that women should be removed
from industry altogether. And in two or
three months he will be after the ladies’
votes! Men have received medals for
less.
“El V.”: Why all this fuss about the
disappearance of towels from Parliament
House, Canberra, and of books from the
library? Certainly, towels have to be
bought, but books are cheap enough.
Books published in Australia, anyway.
By law I have to supply the library with
a copy of every one I publish. My aver-
age contribution for four years has been
11s. worth per year. They are just as
well borrowed by forgetful tribunes as
buried.
Moved by the wreck of the Coramba,
Earle Page is introducing Common-
wealth regulations requiring the installa-
tion of wireless apparatus, capable of
sending and receiving messages, in ves-
sels of 400 tons and less than 1600 tons
gross. But this can apply only to inter-
state shipping; and when Heffron,
M.L.A., who is connected with one of
the maritime unions, proposed that a
similar requirement should be enforced
in the case of vessels trading within N. S.
Wales, he received a chilling reply from
Minister Spooner. That gentleman hopes
that legislation will “shortly be intro-
duced,” but “the subject has to be con-
sidered in relation to the cost.” The
same N.S.W. concern owned the Annie
M. Miller, lost with six hands, and the
Christina Fraser, lost with 17 hands.
Neither had wireless. Should “cost” be
the paramount consideration in such a
case?
Since the nominee N.S.W. Leg. Coun-
cil was abolished, members have been
allowed to ride free on Government
trains and trams. They are now being
made deadheads by statute for terms cor-
responding to their periods of “service,”
though their passes, formerly good for
all the Government lines in Australia
and M.L., will now be restricted to N. S.
Wales. Lang Labor opposed the bill,
and Spring, the C.P. member for
Mudgee, said the issue of gold passes
had “become a scandal.” Then Mr.
Spring turned a handspring, as it were,
and voted for the bill.
Sampson, the Senator from Tasmania,
administered a neat rebuke to fellow-
Senator Bertie Johnston (W.A.) after one
of the latter’s secession speeches:
As a member of the 15th Battalion,
Queenslanders and Tasmanians, J was asso-
ciated with the 16th Battalion from W.A.
No finer battalion ever trod this earth.
Physically, mentally and in every other re-
spect they were magnificent men ; and
all were good Australians.
True, and they are not represented on
the Secesh League. Incidentally, of the
battalion’s four immortals Murray (V.C.,
D.S.O. with bar, D.C.M., Croix de
Guerre) was a Tasmanian ; his pal Black,
who died at Bullecourt, came from Gee-
long ; McCarthy (V.C., Croix de
Guerre) was a Westralian; Pope, their
colonel, was English.
Opponents of the Wheat Bounty Bill
challenged the right of farmer-members
to vote, on the ground that they were
pecuniarily interested. There is no mem-
ber of Parliament, no member of the
public, who is not pecuniarily inter-
ested. Everybody who buys a loaf of
bread is liable to be stung in some way.
Such an interpretation of pecuniary in-
terest would have the effect of stopping
all legislation, for there are few bills ever
submitted which have not a long arm
capable of being stretched to reach the
pocket of somebody.
New as Menzies is to Canberra, he has
shown more than once that in contro-
versy he can give more than he receives.
Challenged about his acceptance of a
brief from Shell Oil—he took it before he
entered Commonwealth politics—and
about the propriety of Attorneys-General
receiving fees from litigants, he justified
himself brilliantly, and quoted interesting
precedents.
When Mr. Ryan was Attorney-General
he enjoyed an extensive and remune-
rative practice in the courts on behalf
of the Queensland Government. Mr. Isaacs
when Commonwealth Attorney-General
quite properly maintained the largest prac-
tice at the Victorian Bar.
In the time of the Federal Laborites who
carped at Menzies, Ryan became their
deputy-leader. And their party, of course,
made Isaacs C.J. and then Governor-
General.
Commonwealth estimates item:
Parliament —Loss of stamps, £23.
Perhaps members use them as book-
marks in the books they forget to return.
Tasmanian Labor is consolidating the
State constitutional laws in one Act. One
section (35) should be of interest to the
gentlemen at Canberra who have ad-
mitted among their number a former
member of the Communist International
without calling on him to prove that he
has no Communist affiliations now: —-
If any member of either House shall
take any oath or make any declaration or
act of acknowledgment of allegiance or
adherence to any foreign prince or Power
or do or concur in or adopt any act
whereby he may become a subject or citizen
of any foreign State or Power, his seat in
such House shall become vacant.

Melbourne’s new Lord Mayor Wales
told a gathering last week that, as a
youngster, he tried to get a job selling
newspapers but failed, and took on car-
riage-cleaning instead. In the U.S.A. a
fair number of ex-newsboys have at-
tained to eminence, the late Jack London
among them. In Australia possibly the
most prominent citizen to rise from such
beginnings was the late Federal Minister
Stewart, of Cawarp (Vic.). He sold
papers in Melbourne to men who were
afterwards his colleagues in Cabinet.
“M.G.”: The Alburyite who deserves
most of the kudos for saving the Dutch
airmen was young Mott, son of a local
newspaper man. He it was who hit on the
idea of flicking messages in Morse from
the town lights. The signaller who trans-
lated and the engineer who worked the
switches come next on the roll of honor.
By the way, the mobilisation of the
motor-cars with headlights full on was
forecast in a talkie produced some
months back —which in no wise detracts
from the recognition received by the
alert-minded customer who recognised it
as applicable to the Albury situation.
Mungo MacCallum, the new Chancel-
lor of Sydney Uni., is a curiosity how-
ever you look at him. At 80 his mind is
as clear and vigorous as ever. He is the
only man at the University who has held
every job open to him there, and he has
made a success of them all. Also he
is the shortest intellectual giant that Syd-
ney has known, being little more than
sft. in height. Glasgow claims the dis-
tinction of having produced and edu-
cated him, but he also took degrees at
Berlin and Leipzig universities. He first
arrived in Sydney qs professor of modern
literature nearly 40 years ago.
“Eminence”: There will be heartburn-
ings in Sydney if the hint dropped re-
cently in Melbourne proves inspired and
the Red Hat which Australia has long
been expecting goes to Archbishop
Mannix. Sydneyites, Protestant as well
as Catholic, have grown accustomed to
the idea that Archbishop Kelly is Rome’s
favorite Australian son. He is the least
combative archbishop that the church
has had in Australia, the courtly Eng-
lishman Vaughan not excepted. He
registers indignation on one public issue
alone—the taxation of R.Cs. for the up-
keep of State schools. For the rest he
has no politics. Many of his flock vote
Labor, but he has claimed Premier
Stevens and ex-Premier Bavin as his
friends. He speaks highly of Mr. Lyons
—but then he never fails to say a good
word for Mr. Scullin when a chance
offers. And he thinks a lot of Stanley
Bruce. The completion of St. Mary’s
Basilica has been the triumph of his
career on the material side.
William Teeling and Sir Archibald
Weigall are friendly rivals as missioners
of Empire. Sir Archibald has arrived to
whip up members for the Royal Empire
Society; Mr. Teeling is on a similar mis-
sion for the Overseas League. The
league, though a comparative newcomer
(it only materialised in 1910, whereas
the other organisation was going decades
before as the Colonial Institute) is very
strong numerically. Mr. Teeling has
had one shot at Parliament, but, as he
stood as a Conservative for London
Docks against Jack Jones, his defeat was
a foregone conclusion.
“H.J.”: It is Stanley Brearley, not his
brother Norman, who has joined the
Perth Stock Exchange (B. 28/11/ ’34).
“Old-timer”: The union of two inter-
esting Anglo-Australian families occurred
when Elizabeth Knox, daughter of a
former High Court C.J., and the Hon.
Lewis Hugh Clifford (the males of this
Devonshire family have had Hugh as
one of their Christian names for nearly
three centuries) were married at St.
Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney, last week.
The bride is descended through her
mother from William Lawson, an adven-
turous spirit who arrived from London
as a member of the N.S.W. Corps 135
years ago, and after crossing the Blue
Mountains with Wentworth and Blaxland
became a big landowner in the Bathurst
district. W. F. Lawson, who gave the
bride away, is the explorer’s grandson.
The ’groom is a Melbournite by adop-
tion, and his father, Lord Clifford of
Chudleigh, lived in Tasmania till he in-
herited the title in 1916. The Cliffords
are related—chiefly through the Petre,
Denbigh, and Mowbray and Stourton
clans —to most of England’s great Catho-
lic families.
The Fapal Legate.
His Eminence Joseph Macßory, Car-
dinal Archbishop of Armagh, performed
his last public function in connection
with the Eucharistic Congress on Sunday
—the opening of a £50,000 Jesuit build-
ing at Watsonia (Vic.). When the Legate
suggested recently that Archbishop Man-
nix might be made a Cardinal, the wish
may have been father to the thought.
The Melbourne Archbishop, like the
visiting Cardinal, is a Maynooth man,
whereas Archbishop Kelly was educated
by the Christian Brothers, Waterford, at
St. Peter’s, Wexford, and in Rome. The
Cardinal is also a theological scholar of
the stature of Archbishop Mannix;
apart from his books, his contributions
to Irish and American reviews have been
read by Catholics all over the world.
Harold Clapp, Vic. Railway Commis-
sioner, just returned from an overseas
tour, is the only white Australian who
has been mistaken for one of his own
black brudders. Though born in Mel-
bourne he was appointed to his present
job from an American railway company.
A London paper, misled by the word
“native,” came out helpfully with “Mr.
Clapp is an Australian aborigine.”
Lloyd Nicholson, whom some Vic-
torians considered a coming Les Darcy —
he had won 13 of his first 14 fights —
was deck boy on the Coramba, which
went down with all hands off Phillip
Island during the Vic. storms.
The late Sir James O’Grady was a
fine specimen of a British trade-unionist.
Born in Bristol, where his father was a
dock laborer, he took the same pride
in his origins as J. H. Thomas and others
who have risen from humble to high
places. He was by nature what the
Americans call a mixer, yet he had
plenty of dignity when the occasion
called for it. He became M.P. for a
Leeds constituency in 1906, went on a
mission to Russia in 1917, and from then
onwards did special service work in
Flanders, Ireland and elsewhere, all he
was sent to Tasmania as Governor in
1924. He then resigned from Parlia-
ment and accepted a knighthood. His
health was never good while in Aus-
tralia (he suffered from the after-effects
of a virulent attack of smallpox picked
up on one of his visits to Russia), but he
was the cheeriest of men. He was Gov-
ernor of the Falkland Islands when he
had to hurry to London for medical
advice. He died of blood poisoning in
a Clapham nursing home at 68.
“Manly”: The attendance of Arch-
bishop Mowll at High Mass at St.
Saviour’s, Redfern (Sydney), was signifi-
cant. Archbishop Wright disapproved of
Father Maclean’s ways, but the veteran
Anglo-Catholic stuck to his chasuble,
aumbry and incense. A storm destroyed
the chancel of his church. His stipend
was cut off. He rebuilt the chancel at his
own expense —the mosaic floor with its
shamrock design is the joy of his heart
—and carried on without a stipend. For
25 years he and his church were treated
as outside the Anglican fold, and now it
looks as if they are to be welcomed back.
Father Maclean is leaving on an 18
months’ visit to his beloved Ireland.
John Musgrave Harvey, J., of N. S.
Wales, is retiring because of failing
eyesight. He lost an eye some years ago,
and now the other has become affected.
A slight', ascetic-looking man, with a
gentle, almost diffident, manner, he soon
proved to be one of the strongest Judges
N. S. Wales has had. Vast legal know-
ledge, integrity and a mind which probed
straight to the essential point were the
secrets of Harvey’s power. He arrived in
Sydney from England over 40 years ago ;
a typical product of Marlborough and
Oxford (Keble was his college), with'
amiable ways and a nice tenor voice.
Members of the N. S. Wales Bar recog-
nised him for what he was inside five
years. He became a Supreme Court Judge
when Justice Ricli went to the High
Court in 1913, and he was made Chief
Judge in Equity when P. W. Street took
the Chief Justiceship. He is a pillar of
the Anglican church. His father was
vicar of Hillingdon, near Hampstead,
where he was born.
Francis J. Gilmore, an alderman of
Redfern (Sydney), has been made a
knight commander of the Order of St.
Gregory. He is a Redfern native, and
was Mayor during the Eucharistic Con-
gress in 1928. The Gilmores have
always been workers for the church.
Frank’s father enabled the Carmelite
Order of nuns to become established in
Australia, and Joe, a brother, was made
a knight of the Order of St. Silvester six
years ago.
Justice Long Innes, N.S.W.’s next
Chief Judge in Equity, is a grandson of
Macquarie’s friend, Captain Long Innes,
of the 31st Regiment. The Judge’s father
was an eminent Supreme Court Judge
before him; also a member of several
Ministries. Reg Innes was educated at
Malvern and New College, Oxford, and
quickly established himself as an Equity
junior on his return to Sydney. He took
silk in 1916, and was appointed to the
Bench nine years later. He was a keen
cricketer like his brother George (also a
barrister), who died in the post-war in-
fluenza epidemic. In addition to being
a fine lawyer he has a vigorous mind, and
he never hesitates to speak it. Alone of
the Judges he came out with a precis of
what most people thought when the last
Lang Government cut down the State
Judges’ already exiguous salaries. One
of the measures of economy which he
adopted as a result was to resign from
the Union Club.
Vic. Minister of Works J. P. Jones is
about to provide the astounding spec-
tacle of a politician going abroad at his
own expense. Jones first came before
the public as a racing cyclist in the days
of Charlie Kellow and Plugger Bill
Martin. Off the arena he was a big gun
of the Vic. Socialist party, but early dis-
covered his business ability by making a
pot of money out of a tailoring business.
He entered politics as a Labor M.L.C.
and proved an exceptionally able Works
Minister. When the recent cleavage came
Jones joined the Argyle Cabinet.
From J. M. Fowler:
George Pearce didn’t start his career in the
Subiaco Debating Society, as alleged (B.
21/11/’34). He was never a member. His first
speechifying was done as member of a little
group that founded a Labor party in Perth, with
a small office in a Hay-street building. It was
I who, as organising secretary of the Federal
League, gave him his first opportunity to
address a public meeting of importance. The
league had a long battle to get the referendum
on Federation submitted to the voters of West-
ralia, but towards the climax of the move-
ment, when things were shaping in our favor,
I put it up to the council of the league that
we should add the little Labor party of Perth
to our numbers. The chairman, George Leake,
and others strongly objected, principally on the
ground that the organisation had no public
standing nor speakers of any competence. I
carried my point, however, and arranged for
Pearce to say something at a big public rally.
He was weak, hestitating and commonplace. But
that was his jumping-off ground for the subse-
quent Senate campaign, and the goldfields
vote, which was very strong, put him and Dc
Largie into the Senate, where he has managed
to stay ever since.

ChecMrid" TYRE
Barnet Class “Checkskid” is a tyre designed especially for today’s
gruelling traffic conditions —of high speed travel over harder,
smoother road surfaces.
Its extra breadth of tread, which contains more actual rubber, gives
extra road grip . . . extra safety . . . extra mileage. Its extra
depth of ti'ead gives longer non-skid tyre-life . . . increased
economy . . . immunity from skids and slipping.
In Barnet Glass “Checkskid,” you also get the advantages of
heat resisting design, which reduces the tendency to generated
heat, the main cause of tyre destruction; unique carcase
construction, which gives extra sidewall flexibility; and superimposed
buttresses which strengthen the shoulders and support this new
“more-rubber” tread.

*Subject to £BOO,OOO originally paid for goodwill.
In order to avoid the extra taxation to
be imposed on such operations after the
end of this month, the board has decided
to capitalise £975,000 of reserves. The
distribution will consist of 100,000 prefs.
and 875,000 ords., to be handed out in
the proportion of one new pref. for
every two prefs. now held, and likewise
with the ords. That will raise paid capi-
tal to £2,925,000 in 300,000 prefs. (they
carry a cumulative 7 p.c. and advance
with the ords. beyond that rate) and
2,625,000 ords., on which an all-round
10 p.c. would call for £42,887 more than
the profit claimed for the last term, or
£99,000-odd less than average net earn-
ings for the half-dozen years to the close
of accounts in 1930. Certainly condi-
tions have changed vastly since, but they
are on the mend, and the co. has tightened
its grip upon the trade by the purchase
of a lot of hotel freeholds in the last
four years. So, subject to economic de-
velopments, 10 p.c. on £2,925,000 may
not prove to be out of reach ; on capital
and visible reserves combined it will call
for 6.7 p.c., and the inner strength is be-
lieved to be substantial.
After providing for contingencies, the
improvement in the gross return from
the trade last term (£266,446) was £3215
as against £18,994 in the previous year.
Rentals, etc. (£72,866, after deducting
compensation fees, etc.), were up £16,012.
The growth in exes. (£89,699) was £4154,
leaving the declared net result £15,073
better at 8.5 p.c. on £2,925,000, or 5.7
p.c. on capital and visible reserves com-
bined.

To add £100,516 to debtors’ balances,
£25,774 to cash, etc., and wipe out mort-
gages (£26,662 at the close of accounts
in 1933), only £16,767 was added to
the amount coming to sundry creditors.
On fixed assets £71,057 more was written
off than was spent. The spring in the
more or less liquid surplus (£1,489,038,
including stocks) was £125,670. Stocks
were little in excess of the 1924 figure,
and the co. has meanwhile bought the
Melbourne Co-op., Fitzgerald’s (Castle-
maine) and Cohn’s (Bendigo).

Overproduction of canned fruits, fol-
lowed by local price-cutting and an un-
satisfactory volume of export sales,
affected the 1933 figures, and the last
term opened with the outlook anything
but bright. However, circumstances
were kind, and the year finished with
record sales for the industry—l,4oo,ooo
cases overseas and 800,000 cases locally
—thanks partly to the action of growers
in adopting more orderly marketing
methods and partly to seasonal influ-
ences. Never in the history of the
canned-fruit industry have stocks been
cleared so completely, says H. J. Co-op.’s
chairman, Ach Palfreyman.
The result shows up in a spring of
£22,811 in the co.’s Australian profits
and of £259 in net earnings outside
Australia:

The £134,483 was 9.4 p.c. on the
£1,430,173 of capital as against 7.7, 11;9,
6.4, 8.3, 11.3 and 11 p.c. back to 1928,
and an extra 3d. was distributed, lifting
the div. from 6| p.c. to 7) p.c.
At the end of October the co. had
£2,269,493 (up £IOO,OOO during the
twelvemonth) invested in a group of
jam- and fruit-canning and -preserv-
ing and general merchandising sub-
sidiaries in the Commonwealth, Maori-
land, S. Africa and England. The
curtain is kept drawn over their figures,
and, since the parent’s accounts tell no
more than they have to, the investor in
the shares for the most part merely backs
the management to continue handling the
organisation successfully. The co. was
formed in 1909 with a half-million of
capital. Over the 20 years to the
close of accounts in ’29 divs. averaged a
shade under 11 p.c. p.a., sweetened with
£455,492 of bonus scrip in ’27, though
share premiums (£59,040) take a bit of
the gilt off the gingerbread.
At 355. 6d. the scrip returns 4.2 p.c.
on a 1\ p.c. div. basis. As for cover,
about two years ago the chairman said
that the assets of the subsidiaries, if
generously valued, would not equal
395. 4d., at which figure the market then
priced the shares.

Formed in 1923, this co. put up mills at
Albury and Orange, and its first half-
dozen years were full of troubles. The
jettisoning of £156,105 of capital in 1929
purged the accounts of £87,160 of accu-
mulated losses and preliminary exes. ; the
other £68,945 was used to wipe out the
holding in W.A. Woollen Mills (£10,000)
and write down the book value of
premises and plant, bought when prices
were at their peak. More important still,
exchange and the tariff provided the in-
dustry with fresh opportunities, and
wage adjustments helped, too.
After a 10-year wait and loss of one-
third of their capital, shareholders got
into the picture with 5 p.c. in 1933.
Orders were then being booked freely,
and anew Federal award provided for
a 44-hour week and a uniform rate of
wages in all States except Queensland,
thus placing this and other N. S. Wales
manufacturers on a better footing to meet
competition from Victoria.
Owing to the collapse of the raw wool
market during the second half of the last
term, “a considerable sum had to be
written off the cost price of stocks to
bring them down to present-day levels
for raw materials and finished products.”
Gross earnings (£35,130) were £8685
lighter. Including £6OIB struck off the
book value of wool on order and £2500
(down £1900) reserved for taxation, exes.
(£25,397) were £3350 heavier. The net
result was thus £12,035 lighter at 3.3 p.c.
on capital as against 7.4 p.c. in the pre-
vious term, and 3| p.c. was distributed.
That leaves out of the figuring whatever
had been paid on 6050 shares forfeited
during the year, plus an unexplained re-
duction of £282 in the forfeited share
account (£8397).
To pay the previous year’s div. and
add £17,541 net to the book value of
stocks, £16,166 was tacked on to the
overdraft and £3055 to the amount com-
ing to sundry creditors:

This co. set up in Perth in 1912 to com-
pete with old-established concerns for
local risks. Within half a dozen years the
premium income had bounded from a
few thousands to over a million, and re-
serves approaching three-quarters of a
million had been accumulated. It was
the immediate outcome of a plunge into
the international whirlpool of war-time
marine business; but much of what
looked like profit turned out to be losses.
These, the special demands of the tax-
gatherer and adjustment of the book
value of securities swallowed over half
a million of reserves during the live years
to the close of accounts in 1925, and the
management has not since rpet with
much luck in the development of other
lines.
Combining the fire, accident and
marine figures, we get these results:

Despite a spring of £14,146 in last year’s
net premiums, the underwriting surplus
(£187) was £2928 lighter. Claims were
the trouble, as they usually are where
reinsurances bulk largely in premium
income.

Australian Alloy Steel (Sales), Ltd.
Australian Alloy Steel, a little Sydney
concern set up by J. M. Deschamps
about three years ago, when the outlook
generally was full of pitch, is making
steady progress. It manufactures spares,
wearing parts and general steel castings.
For the year to June 30 last, it netted 7.4
p.c. on £39,009 of share capital, and sales
have continued to expand each month
since. To separate the buying and selling
from the manufacturing side of the busi-
ness, a subsidiary, Australian Alloy Steel
(Sales), Ltd., has been formed, and is
offering 5000 7 p.c. cum. prefs. at par.
The parent, which takes 5000 fully-paid
ords. and will subscribe for another
2500, guarantees the pref. div., and
undertakes to buy the shares at par at
the end of five years if requested to do
so. It will also pay the selling co. a
minimum commission of 5 p.c. on general
foundry products, and a higher rate on
new lines. It looks like a sound move,
and appearances are that there will be
no difficulty in keeping up payments to
the prefs.
Placer Development
Placer Development has accepted
20,000 f.p. Bulolo $5 shares in final settle-
ment for the Bulowat-Burnside areas.
It has agreed to transfer the Arnold
lease for 5000 Bulolo paids. Subject
to sales since April 30, and allowing for
payments to Guinea Gold, Placer now
holds over 305,000 Bulolo shares. It
also owns half the 1,200,000 dollar shares
(Oroville holds the other half) in Pato
Consolidated, Colombia, S. America,
which is expected to net about $130,000
p.a. for approximately 20 years from re-
dredging tailings. In addition, “a sub-
stantial profit will be made from dredg-
ing virgin ground.” Further, Placer and
Oroville each own 600,000 dollar shares
in Asnazu Gold Dredging (capital
$1,500,000 —300,000 paids were handed
to the vendors), which is expected to
turn in an annual working profit of
$340,000 (excluding amortisation) for
seven years. This show, also in Colom-
bia, was tested by L. A. Decoto and
turned down by Placer a few years ago ;
the rise in the price of gold made it
worth while.
For the same reason, Placer has
thrown off an Australian subsidiary
(Rutherglen Gold Dumps, nominal capi-
tal £50,000), in which it holds a 64 p.c.
interest, to treat slum dumps in Victoria.
(Here the tested portion of the material
indicates an annual working profit of
between £30,000 and £40,000 (Aus. cur-
rency) for three years, and there is an-
other three or four years’ work, at
about the same rate of earnings, in the
untested portion—a flotation plant to
handle 1000 tons daily is being installed.
Properties in various parts of the
world, including the Pani-Ilota mines, a
large low-grade gold lode on the island
of Celebes, are still under consideration.
The board’s policy is that, wherever the
co. becomes interested, the management
and general direction of affairs shall re-
main in its hands.
What Guinea Gold’s Aiaiuwi-Bulwau
claims (they aggregate about 7000 acres,
chiefly in Papua) will ultimately turn out
to be worth nobody can say definitely at
the moment. A preliminary survey has
indicated that they well warrant close
investigation, and this the co. has in
hand. It also has enough cash (£15,565)
to see the work to completion, though, if
a large new field is opened up, and the
co. decides to develop and work the area
itself, a lot more money will be wanted.
Among the assets are 63,875 $5 Bulolo
shares, worth about £560,000 on the
market', and there are 450 Bulolo
shares to come in respect of the final
payment for Guinea Gold’s old northern
leases, making the total holding 64,325
shares, on which the excess of market
over book value is approximately
£540,000. Upon receipt of Bulolo’s div.
next month it is expected that the co.
will pass on 6|d. per 2s. share.
* * * *
The Himalaya and Margaret Cos.,
two Sydney concerns which are reopen-
ing old mines on the Kirk diggings
(N.Q.), are considering erection of
a 50-ton-a-day mill (cost about £3000) to
treat stone from both shows. In the
Himalaya there is 12,000 tons, expected
to average lOdwt., in sight. Develop-
ment at the Margaret has not yet ad-
vanced sufficiently to estimate ore re-
serves. The reef, 23in. wide, goes from
12dwt. to 15dwt.
* * * *
Mt. Coolon West has taken a 12-
months’ option over the old Hadleigh
Castle, at Rochford, about five miles
from the old Kirk diggings (N.Q.). The
mine was worked by a co. from 1896 to
1903, and thereafter by tributors at inter-
vals up to 1916, when it was abandoned.
Of the three reefs, only one has been
extensively prospected.
* * * *
Trenching along the cap of a leader
off the main reef at Mt. Clearview at
the head of the Cape River (N.Q.), Clem
Walker got 750 z. lldwt. from 101 tons
of ore, with another 29dwt. per ton in
the tailings. The leader is from three
to 18 inches thick.
* * * *
The Costerfield Smelting and Refining
Cos. is putting up works at Costerfield
(Vic.) to retreat 15,000 tons of scoria,
containing 5 p.c. to 10 p.c. antimony and
lOdwt. to 13dwt. gold per ton. The gold
will be recovered in a matte, while the
antimony and other volatile metals will
be driven off as oxides and caught in a
series of dust chambers, says the “Chemi-
cal Engineering and Mining Review.”
W. Brozenalt, who designed the plant,
will be in charge of operations.
* * * #
Yet another party has set out in search
of the rainbow’s end —Lasseter’s alleged
reef. S. R. Hummerston and three others
left Sydney for Alice Springs last week.
The objective is a “gold-bearing reef
three-quarters of a mile long and aver-
aging 33in. wide.” In what way it was
proved to be gold-bearing is not men-
tioned ; its location appears to be some-
where within a radius of about 450 miles
from Oodnadatta.
* * * *
Support for the “low-grade policy”—
reducing the grade of gold-bearing ore
treated with the rise in the price of
gold—seems to be gaining ground. The
big S. African cos. have gone for it
baldheaded; in Westralia some have
quietly adopted it, and producers
in a large way in other coun-
tries are thinking of getting into
step. Short-term speculators who bought
believing that prospects of the bullion
market would be reflected in divs. are
protesting, of course. The object of the
cos. is to ensure expansion of the indus-
try, to increase ore reserves, and there-
fore the life of the mine, and to widen
the scope of employment. Speaking in
London General Smuts recently declared
that any attempt to prevent pro rata
lowering of .the grade as the price of
gold rose, or to aim at higher profits by
working only high-grade ore, would meet
with energetic opposition from the
S. African Government, and probably
result in a stiffening of the tax as profits
increased.
*** . *
Figures for 11 months ended Novem-
ber make it clear that Westralia’s gold
yield for 1934 will be the highest since
1919. Total production since 1886, when
accounts of gold won were first
kept, is valued at over £181,000,000.
Features of present production are in-
creased milling of ore and cyaniding
of residues at mines which, until
recently, had been idle for years ; they
are now being turned to profitable account
owing to higher gold prices and more
efficient methods. Prospecting is more
intensive now than it has been since the
early days.
* * * *
Lake View’s latest annual estimate of
ore reserves is substantially up in ton-
nage, and a couple of shillings or so
down in grade. The figures are 2,463,600
tons, averaging 30s. with gold at 85s. an
ounce. Average working costs at 245.
3d. (Australian currency) show a drop
of 22d. per ton. Development for the
12 months totalled 25,085 ft., and 15,359 ft.
of diamond drilling was done. Capital
expenditure on plant, machinery, develop-
ment, etc., aggregated £127,000. Balance
sheet showed cash £123,456 and Govern-
ment securities £160,000, both sterling.
* * * *
Wiluna has proved by boring that its
east (main) lode is payable over a big
average width at 1500 ft. vertical from
the surface. With gold at its statutory
price, values average 28s. 3d. for 20|ft.,
of which Bft. assays 335. a ton. This is
the deepest exposure of payable ore in
the mine. It indicates that Wiluna con-
tinues to be a “first-class life.”
# ' * * *
After writing off an expenditure of
£9431, Westralian-controlled New Ven-
ture claims a surplus of £8864 for the
period to Sept. 30. The auditor says:
“Of gross revenue of £20,279 brought
to credit in accounts, £9500 was not
received in cash, but represents the par
value of 95,000 4s. contributing shares
paid to 2s. in Coolgardie Brilliant. Your
co. faces a contingent liability in respect
of calls thereon of £9500. The surplus
of £8864 shown in the accounts is, there-
fore, not a cash one, and what cash
you may reasonably expect to derive
from the holding is a matter on which I
can express no opinion.” The balance
sheet shows cash £4248 ; a call has since
been made, and others may follow. The
directors talk of better days and of early
flotation of subsidiaries.
* * * *
Several Kalgoorlie and Boulder gold-
producing leases which have been in
existence for 42 years are about due for
renewal. These include Lake View and
Star, Boulder Perseverance and Great
Boulder. In order to secure their ground,
the cos. working these shows are sur-
rendering them and applying for new
leases —the Mining Act provides for a
tenure of only 42 years.
* * * *
For the year to June 30 last Asso-
ciated Mining and Finance, which has
just absorbed the Associated G. M. Cos.
(W.A.), netted £41,434 (sterling) against
£18,254 for the preceding 12 months.
After a debit of £3583 from the previous
year had been lopped off, £37,851 re-
mained ; an Bd. div. took £19,845, leav-
ing £18,006 in the kitty.
* * * *
Associated Northern Ora Banda (W.A.)
recently had samples of its tailings dump
at Ora Banda tested by the School of
Mines, Kalgoorlie. The results suggest
that classification and regrinding of the
+ 200 mesh material will not be neces-
sary, and that an extraction of I.2dwt.
gold per ton (head value I.Bdwt.), with
moderate consumption of cyanide and
lime, is possible. The actual recovery
will, of course, depend upon the effici-
ency of the plant and the skill of the
operator.
* * * *
At Spargo’s Find, 28 miles south of
Coolgardie (W.A.), there are five shafts,
sunk to 70ft., and the ore-body has been
proved over a length of 500 ft. There is
about 1000 tons of ore at grass, estimated
to average lOdwt. The co. has 200 acres
to play around in. Absence of water
threatens to be a handicap when further
development has taken place.
* * * *
111 health has turned John Warrick,
who transformed Great Boulder Prop.
W.A. from a derelict into a dividend
payer, out of the saddle. He was asso-
ciated with the co. for 38 years—3o as
underground manager and eight as
general manager—during which time the
mine produced £16,000,000 worth of gold.
The new flotation plant, installed at a
cost of £120,000, was his idea. His place
will be taken by Ernest Williams, who
also enjoys a high reputation in mining
circles.
* * * *
After much delay the Kangaroo Cos.
has got down to the job of unwatering
the Last Chance, Kanowna (W.A.). The
pump is lifting about 2800 gallons an
hour ; it will be some weeks before the
bottom level (525 ft.) will become acces-
sible.
* * * *
Southern Cross, a De Bernales float,
expects to have its mine unwatered by
the end of this year. Meanwhile, the
two boring-plants will continue opera-
tions.
* * * *
New Kalgurli, which is re-treating
sands and slimes on its property east of
the Croesus Prop., Kalgoorlie (W.A.), has
cleaned up 3000 tons for 1690 z. of gold.
* * * *
Four shafts have been sunk on the
Yilgangie Queen, at Yilgangie (W.A.),
and good values have been struck at 85ft.
Also, a parallel lode has been discovered,
and the directors are optimistic, of
course.
* * # *
“Old-timer”: Recently some engineers
landed in Maoriland with hand-boring
plant and casing of small diameter.
These proved to be useless on the heavy
and hard gravels met with. Then they
tried shafting. Any old-time miner could
have told them no shaft can be put down
on rivers here below water level. Instal
a pump and you merely pump the river.
Nothing lighter than a keystone plant
with casing weighing not less than 281 b.
to the foot is any good.

THE WORLD'S PUREST -& THE NATION'S FAVOURITE


ABORIGINALITIES
“Kwakprak”: Billy came into our
hospital last month with pneumonia, and
was doing well until his mate Bluey went
down with tick paralysis. We don’t
treat dogs, as a rule, but it became a
matter of pulling Bluey through to save
Billy from worrying his ill-treated old
heart to a full stop. So we killed the
tick on Bluey’s neck with kerosene, ex-
cised it and a half-inch of skin under
local antesthetic, gave him injections of
trypan blue and some strychnine to help
his respiratory muscles, washed out his
bowel and kept him warm. He was
an admirable patient. At Billy’s request,
an aged friend of vast bush experience
was called in consultation. He brought
a nauseous liquid, composed of “ ’erbs,”
and never known to fail. We responded
tactfully, but put the ’erbs secretly down
the sink. Bluey has made a complete
recovery, and Billy is convalescent. “I
knoo old Jack’s ’erbs would cure ’im,”
said Billy to matron to-day. “You can
’ave all yer flash injections and things.
The old bush remedies is the dinkum
stuff.”

“Tockilly”: The surest test of a
bushie! He looks round for a rail to
lean his elbows on, while the townie
negligently leans up against a post.
‘Kanga’ : Another way to pick a
bushman in town. He lifts his feet
higher than the city-dweller, who is used
to made paths and roads. Bill Outback
is always stepping over saltbush, stones
or furrows, and unconsciously lifts his
feet.

“Flight”: If ibises are not molested—,
and no one but a vandal would molest
them —they become the friendliest of
fowls. On a W.Q. station I have seen
strings of them stepping up the stairs
leading to the men’s hut, stalking
through, coming down the other side and
taking up the chase of ’hoppers with the
gravest unconcern. They grow so accus-
tomed to men and to buildings that they
almost ignore them. But they don't
ignore a cousin—the glossy ibis. This
fellow, black with splashes of green, and
possessed of a serrated bill, dwells singly
at the edges of waterholes and other
swampy places. As soon as ever he puts
in an appearance the others just melt
away.
H*
“Kanga”: Let me tell “J.J.8.” (B.
31/10/’34) that emus caught in fences
are no novelty in Westralia. I release
an average of two a day on a run of
80 mites round at Leonora, fenced with
five and six wires.
* * * *
“Worro”: The good motor tyre picked
up on a Queensland beach (B. 17/10/’34)
reminds me of a more weighty kind of jet-
sam —a large blacksmith’s anvil. It was
washed ashore at Cape Banks LS.A.), and
was discovered (I won’t say picked up)
by a lighthouse-keeper. How such an
unwieldy article managed to reach shore
beats me.
* * *
“Murlonga”: Where did “El V.” get
the idea that “the neatness of Binghi’s
appendages puts duchesses to shame” (B.
7/11/ ’34)? The abo. is not only big-
footed ; he is splay-footed, with a space
between his big toe and the next in which
the average duchess could easily place her
heel without touching on either side. If
“El V.” has ever done any tracking—
which I doubt —he would be able to pick
up an abo.’s tracks even if blindfolded —
" Don’t go, sir. You’re next.”
though I admit he might confound that
human track with the one left by a
camel, as they are both splayed to an
equal extent. Any unshod human’s foot
spreads, going out of the shape in which
boots confine it. If “El V.” doesn’t be-
lieve me, let him ask some of his
duchesses.
H= * * *
“Mugshut” : The endurance of lost bush
children was singularly demonstrated by
six-year-old Howard Briscow, who wan-
dered away the other day while birdnest-
ing at Berrook, in the Vic. Mallee. Bare-
foot and lightly clad, he kept the s.-w.
wind at his back and went straight into
waterless country. He followed a track
for a few chains, but struck out into the
scrub again. Searchers had an unenviable
time picking a way through torturing
porcupine grass, but the boy had repeat-
edly walked through heavy thickets of
the stuff. He was found under a bush
exhausted, after having covered 22 miles
in 25 hours.
* * * *
“D.H.0.”: Trailing a line along the
Barrier Reef, off Rossel Island, we
hooked a Spanish mackerel. One of the
crew was leisurely pulling it in when a
shark attacked our catch. The mackerel
hopped twice out of the water; the
second time as it landed the shark
snapped a piece out of its gill, enough
to get the hook in its own top jaw. The
wire between hook and line was
quickly drawn through the mackerel’s
gill, so that both were hauled on board.
The mackerel was about 4ft. long and
the shark 4ft. 6in.
* * * *
“Whangamomona”: A Maoriland cow
(four-legged) scored one of the cheapest
and most effective benders 1 have ever
seen. We had been making cider, and
when we poured off the liquid the mush
of apples was left in a barrel in
the backyard. Strawberry found it and
waded in. She had cleaned up practi-
cally the lot by the time we discovered
her. At our yells she staggered a yard
or two with her legs all trying to go in
different directions, fell over and hic-
cupped horribly during her subsequent
undignified withdrawal.
* * * *
“Only Dave”: You coves down in J’he
Bulletin office mightn’t believe it, but
the sands on the seashore wot the city
potes talk about ain’t in it with the meat-
ants up our way. They sent an
old bloke off his onion the other
day. Dad saw him jump out of
a goods at the junction and put him
on to keep an eye on the additional
conditional till we could fence it in. He
got jumpy about the ants straightway
becos there was a dozen -or two (or per-
haps a few more than that) on the corn
junk, and a few got in his tea when he
was having his first feed, and he swal-
lowed a couple. I often swallow a
couple, but you get used to them ; but
I don’t like swallowing bulldogs, becos
the cows bite down below. Anyhow, to
make a long story short, Dad and me
druv over the other day and found him
standing bareheaded up to his neck in
the waterhole. We yelled to him to come
out, but he said “I can’t. I’m the cocky’s
joy, and me lid’s off, and if I come out
I’ll get full uv ants and y’ll have ter
throw me away.” We got his hat and
threw it to him, and the poor old geezer
jambed it on tight and come out quite
satisfied, except that he said, “Do you
think yer ought to stand me in water in
case they crawl up the sides and make
the top all smelly?” He went to Sydney
with Sergeant O’Brien yesterday, so you
might see him about the pub. He’s got
a white-handled pocket-knife.
“Notaden”: Twice during the past
month I have seen goannas climbing
trees carrying a short stick in their
mouths. Watched, they merely watched
back in the customary goanna fashion,
and I failed to see what they did with
the sticks. Goannas don’t nest in trees ;
they don’t need firewood ; nor can they
use the sticks as missiles. In half a
century of familiarity with the bush I’ve
never seen the creatures carry sticks be-
fore. Is it a sign of an impending flood,
election, earthquake or merely a new
fashion amongst goannas? They were
real sticks, not the spiked tails of jim-
jams. And they were real goannas, of
the usual shape and color, without wings,
cloven hoof or smoky breath. Will the
Council please expound?
* * * *
“Porcupine Joe”: If “Prickly” (B.
5/12/’34) had read my par. more care-
fully he would have seen that porcis and
bush-rats were included in the hint to
watch the dogs lest they invade the sanc-
tuary of the pre-culinary tomb. Although
few dogs will eat a bandi, they will dig
them up. But I had a bull terrior who,
though usually fastidious about his food,
would kill bandies, rip them up and eat
the insides with every appearance of
enjoyment. He ate no other part of the
animal, but clearly regarded his ghastly
choice of smallgoods with the same zest
as epicures regard Limburger cheese.
* * * #
“Barang”: Scientists must be in a dither
over the cabled report that the 30ft. sea
monster washed ashore on the British
Columbia coast has been definitely iden-
tified as a survivor of Steller’s sea-cow,
a species of dugong, native to Alaskan
waters, and reputedly extinct since 1765.
A warm-blooded mammal, the sea-cow
was first reported in 1741 by Behring
when he was shipwrecked on Kam-
chatka, and the crew was saved from
starvation by the occasional harpooning
of one of these animals. Those taken
were estimated by the navigator to excee .
80001 b. in weight. Present discovery
makes even the layman wonder if all
these stories of sea monsters are con-
ceived in the saloon bar. There are
thousands of square miles of surface
waters that are never disturbed by ship-
ping.
“Atrax”: The big pugnacious spider
which “Hagus” describes (B. 21/11/’34)
was probably of the North Coast funnel-
web variety (Atrax formidabilis). They
live in burrows lined with silk, and are
very dangerous. The bite of one nearly
killed a man at Wauchope (N.S.W.)
some years ago. A closely-related species,
the Sydney funnel web, has caused at
least four deaths since 1927 and many
cases of serious illness. Two children
died from bites of this species, each
within two hours of the nip, and two
women in 11 and 13 hours respectively.
First aid is similar to that for snakebite,
and no time should be lost in getting
medical assistance. As with the bite of
the red-backed spider, their stings are
often followed by dangerous septic com-
plications.
“Calibrate”: That story of
the 21 blasts fired by some
roadmakers on Mt. Welling-
ton (Tas.) as a salute to the
Duke of Gloucester (B.
15/12/’34) brings back a sur-
prise experience by the writer
on his first visit to Port
Moresby. It was in the
Colonial Office days, and the
Lt.-Governor was Le Hunte,
then returning from a trip to
the south in the Merrie Eng-
land. As the yacht came into
the harbor a salute of 11 guns
(a C.O. L.-G.’s quota) boomed
out in perfect time. I was
much astonished; the Port
was apparently fortified, and
seemed to boast at least a
battery of 4.7’5. Later the
truth was revealed at the pub
—-there was only one in those
days. The salute was fired
with half-plugs of dynamite with ad-
justed fuses. These were placed in
empty kerosene-tins, which gave the
shots the necessary resonance. Jock Mc-
Donald, for years head gaoler of the
Possession, was the genius who evolved
the scheme.
* * * *
“Squalus”: The contention that sharks
won’t attack dark-skinned folk makes
me tired (B. 5/12/’34). No need to cite
instances in the Fijis, the Heeby-Jeebies
or other outlandish parts of the earth.
There must be many thousands of Aus-
tralians —counting the Diggers, make it
hundreds of thousands —who have seen
the native boys diving for small
coins at Colombo, Aden or other
Eastern ports when a liner is in. Always
among the crowd are one or two minus
a leg or an arm, and “shark” is always
given as the cause.
* * * *
“Foxy Flyer”: Now that the mangoes
are ripening in N.Q. the flying-foxes are
holding high revel and pre-dating their
Christmas. Better poison them. Get a
number of ripe mangoes and bait them—
strychnine for choice. String those man-
goes on one particular tree in positions
that are easy for the fox to take. After
two nights I’ll guarantee no foxes will
go near that tree for the remainder of
the season. Do a repeat with another
tree, and gradually immunity is gained
for the whole orchard.
PULLING “TITS."
I was reared on a selection; I'm a product of
the land,
For my old man kept a dairy where wc milked
the cows by hand;
And they used to take some finding when the
morn was cold and bleak,
For they’d hide amongst the timber in the
paddock by the creek.
But we used to find them somehow in the a.m.
hours so drear,
And we’d send them flying homeward, with old
Rover in the rear,
To the cowyard in the clearing where they'd
stand and chew the cud
Till we waded out to milk them in the slush
and in the mud.
Oh! I lost all faith in justice and my young
dreams went to bits
In those early hours I wasted in my childhood
pulling “tits.”
They were mostly stubborn beggars, but of
all the cows we had
There was none to try the patience of a silent,
suffering lad
Like the baldfaced brindle heifer that we bought
at Riley’s sale.
For your woes were only starting when you
got her in the bail.
When you went to fix the legrope, if you
weren’t mighty quick
She would land you in the mullock with a
well-directed kick.
Or she’d keep her eye upon you till she got
you off your guard,
When she’d swing her mud-caked tailpiece and
she’d sock you good and hard.
Oh! the tricks she played upon us nearly drove
us into fits,
But we sold her to the butcher and we
reckoned we were quits.
When our old man had his breakfast he would
mooch about the shed,
But he never turned to milking—he had never
learned, he said.
And we had a shrewd suspicion that he never
meant to try,
But we had to do our duty ’neath the stern
parental eye.
Then we’d gobble down our breakfast and
set off, v/ith books and slate,
To the schoolhouse at the Crossing, where we
landed mostly late.
And the master, honest fellow, labored hard,
I must confess,
To impart some knowledge to us, but he hadn’t
much success,
For he never seemed to notice that our sadly
muddled wits
Couldn’t rise above the cowshed and the job
of pulling “tits.”
Now I’m living in the city, and I rarely see a
cow,
But the thoughts of Riley’s heifer set my blood
a-boiling now.
And I never read the verses of some sentimental
bard
Telling of the joys of farming but they leave
me sort of jarred;
And I feel I’d like to put him in that cold and
slushy yard
Where my youth was sadly blighted and my
young dreams went to bits—
In those golden hours of childhood that I spent
in pulling “tits.”
VICTORIA.
EDWARD HARRINGTON.


“Gaffe”: That Rabaul cookboy who
credited Carbine with having kicked four
goals three behinds (B. 5/12/’34) was
only a poor, ignorant savage. What
would you say of the cultured English
football expert of the London “Daily
Mail” who was sent to report the annual
Australian Rules match between teams
from Oxford and Cambridge? He
solemnly put it on record that the Light
Blues won by “three goals fourteen bee-
hives.”
H-' * * *
“Worm”: “T.V.T.” (B. 5/12/’34) errs
when he says all the Australian snakes
save the brown are viviparous. The
carpet-snakes and rock pythons are all
egg-layers. Years ago, when I was col-
lecting specimens for the Ruritanian
Museum on Mt. Lindsay (Q.), where both
sorts of constrictors are thick, it was im-
possible to sleep after daylight on the
spring mornings for the incessant cack-
lings of the jubilant serpents. As each of
these lays about 50 eggs, it can be seen
that it has something to cackle about.
* * * *
“Nordbo” : “Mako’s” yarn about the
tea mistaken for after-hours beer (B.
7/11/’34) reminds me of an experience
off Finch-Hatton, outside Mackay
(N.Q.). There had been a bit of a show
in the very wet sugar township, and half
a dozen hard-faced lads in the carriage
of the late train into which I stepped
were exuding beer and looking for more.
“’Shtay round, serg’nt, an’ arrest the wife. She’s shure t’ asshault me."
Being a small bloke, I put the sugar-
bag into the net above my seat very
carefully. Nevertheless, a tiny clink of
glass made the lads prick up their heads,
and presently one of them strolled to
my end of the carriage and reached out
for the bag. I told him apologetically
that the bottles contained kerosene. He
pulled one out, was convinced by the
storekeeper’s label and disgustedly called
me a milk-and-water sissy boy. So I
was, for the large flask of whisky in the
bottom of the bag was for my camp-
mate.
“Tockilly”: Birds and brains? Threw
a chunk of beef to a butcher-bird too
big for him to swallow. He took it to
a near-by broken branch, caught the
meat in a crack and pulled pieces off it,
looking very comical as he “sat back in
the breeching” while tugging.
%
“Pituri”: In the good old days about
the only abo. who had the right of the
road, and who could go through tribes
and towris unmolested, was the pituri
carrier. This fellow walked under a flag
of truce, as it were, from the sandhills
on Carlow, west of the Georgina, right
as far as pituri went —and that was to
the big water of the Gulf and n.-e. to
the Endeavour River. In the drier dis-
tricts of the west, from the Barkly Table-
lands right down to the Toko Ranges,
a strange abo. would be watched continu-
ously in a neighbor’s country. He would
not be molested until he had drunk the
water of the tribe on which he was tres-
passing. After that he was an enemy
possessed of magic powers, and the only
sure cure was death.
* * * *
“Felis”: No need for surprise at that
cat’s ability to swim (B. 5/12/’34).
Many domestic cats take
voluntarily to fishing, and
enter the water freely to
bag their game. There
are good grounds for be-
lieving that all cats were
once water-haunters and
fishers. The wild-cat of
Britain, most untamable
of wild creatures, is a
noted fish-catcher. In
East Africa and through-
out India there are sev-
eral species of cat which
are generically known as
“fishing Cats.” They
haunt river banks and
reedbeds and subsist en-
tirely on fish. These, like
their British relative, are
notorious for their savag-
ery, and have been known to attack
humans when cornered.
* * * #
“Fitzmort”: Picnicking on an old
mine-working in the Barossa Ranges
(S.A.), a small party decided to boil
the billy on a decrepit concrete floor so
as not to contravene the Bushfires Act.
The cook was leaning over the fire when
there was an explosion; he got it on
his chest, and flying embers badly
scorched his face. Detonators or blast-
ing powder couldn’t have been the
cause, as the fire was kindled with small
dry twigs from old gum-trees. After the
victim had been patched up by his wife,
a former war nurse, examination showed
that the cement dressing of the concrete
floor had been blown away. Evidently
the old battery floor was permeated with
cyanide, and the heat had caused the
makeshift hearth to fly.
* * * *
“R.8.C.”: Recently witnessed a paral-
lel to the gag about the dog sitting on
a thistle, howling, too lazy to shift. My
kelpie was lying on the path, every few
seconds giving a convulsive jerk and a
yelp. Cause, small black ants, which
were biting freely; they were literally
swarming over him before he could be
induced to shift himself.
* * * *
“Beelzebub”: One of my western Vic.
neighbors was left a widow with half a
score of children to support. She decided
to carry on the farm. Not only does she
break her own horses and take her falls
like a man, but she drives a team of
bullocks and is a champion axe-wielder.
* * * *
“Trill”: Ararat (Vic.) boasts the only
accordion band in Australia. Conductor
W. Curran waves a baton over 14 expert
players, including a police constable— he
“Take my advice an’ soo ’im, Jacky. You'll git damages out' o’ this."
"Mine tinkit me gottem already.”
used to conduct the local mouth-organ
band. The combination tours country
districts, giving concerts for charity.
:1c * * $
“Hardy”: The fact that Califor-
nian cities appreciate the decorative value
of flowering gum-trees more than Aus-
tralian metropoli brings up again the
sad case of the tree. Those natural
forests which have been laid waste are
now being replanted wholesale with im-
ported pines. In the south such Euro-
peans as the oak, the elm, the plane and
the poplar are all naturalised subjects.
Our "rivers are lined with imported wil-
lows. Our homes, parks and public
places are graced with the Chinese
camphor laurel, the Brazilian jaca-
randa, the Peruvian pepper-tree.
And where are our own trees
being planted? In California.
Swear, somebody!
“Weenen”: The Yank is not the
only one convinced that the gum-
tree is a native of his country (B.
5/12/’34). As long ago as the
South African War many Afri-
kanders held the opinion that it
was a local product. Even in
those days every farm had its
grove of blue-gums and wattle, in-
digenous trees being non est on
the veld and in the Karroo. It
was often a matter for argument
between Australians and the veld
Boers, and the latter were rarely
convinced of this country’s claim
to be the birthplace of the vege-
tables. Even in comparatively
English Southern Natal the same
impression ruled. I myself got a
setback one day when admiring a
huge wattle plantation whose
owner bagged a cool £2OOO a year
from the bark. His claim that the
wattle was imported from Aus-
tralia was met' with good-natured
scoffs. “Go on,” said one of his
hearers; “South Africa sends
hundreds of tons of this tanning
bark to Australia every year. It’s
likely you’d let us do that if you had the
stuff growing there yourselves.” After
that there was nothing to do but shut up,
and I “made it so,” as they say in the
Navy.
* * * ❖
“Bogaduck”: Those axe - depicting
artists (B. 24/10/’34) make me want to
yell, too ; but there is something worse
still —the way in which they draw the
spiral strap on leggings. For every
sketch of a horseman who has the strap
correct —starting from centre of ankle,
running around outside of leg, across
back of calf and finishing on the outside
top of legging —there are scores which
show the strap running the opposite way,
or right on one leg and wrong on the
other.
“Inaha”: That marine jaywalker the
whale has been much in the news of
late because of its playful habit of im-
peding the course of ships. There was
the creature which, when run down by
a Manly ferry steamer, inconsiderately
drifted on to the rocks at Sydney Heads
in August; there were the two guilty
of lese-majeste in obstructing H.M.S.
Leith, the newest ship in the British
Navy, on her voyage from Brisbane to
Auckland. Whales have been observed
from the shore near both those ports,
and a whaling launch in Tory Channel
was rammed and sunk by an in-
furiated right whale cow, the shock of
the collision exploding a bomb and injur-
ing one of the crew. There have been
more collisions between ships and whales
in M.L. than for many years. At
this time of the year whales are usually in
poor condition and are migrating to the
south from the tropics, where the cows
calve. They return from the Antarctic
about the end of March.
* * * *
“’Rifrus”: A. Storr’s lantern-slide
depiction of the evolution of an Abo.
par. (B. 28/II / ’34) recalls the exploits
of a scribe in Shanghai. Among his
jobs was to contribute a brace of
short, out-of-the-ordinary specials. When
shy of material he used to grab
an old Bulletin, turn to “Aboriginali-
ties” and rewrite a couple of the pars,
in pseudo-Biblical jargon, putting the
revelations into the mouth of a stock
character with a Chinese name. He did
it neatly, too, and the rehashed yarns
were widely appreciated among British
and American readers in the port.

“Shorus”: When the new hand arrived
at old Sandy Macpherson’s small out-
back station, he was set to wigging the
wool-blind merinos. Just as the first
one was finished Sandy arrived in per-
turbation. “Hoots, mon!” he yelled.
“Ye needna do baith ees!” “But you
can’t let the poor brutes go round blind
in one eye,” protested the new hand.
“Aye, they’ll do fine that way,” rejoined
Sandy; “an’ it saves a tumble waste o’
wull.”
* * * *
“G.S.L.”: There’s some foundation
for yarns like that which “J. 8.” quoted
recently. When a gipsy wanted to
steal from a farm guarded by a watchdog,
the Romany would carry a piece of raw
meat under his arm all day, that night
tossing it to the dog, which, after eating
it, would find something familiar in the
b. 0., and would then let the marauder
pass. The same stunt, worked with ani-
seed, explains how the prowlers could
entice away the most devoted hound.
When a stallion was to be taken a swab
was used on a mare, then rubbed on
the gipsy’s clothing, and the horse fol-
lowed the thief like Mary’s lamb. All
possible horse-coping tricks were used
to disguise the points of the animal, and
thereafter a disgusted owner, if he did
recognise his nag in the gipsy’s string,
would be faced with the fact that the
stallion was following the thief like a
pet dog.
BATTLER’S PROGRESS.
When first I met old Battling Bill,
Out on the track to Faraway,
Afoot he trudged, and on his back
He bore the rover’s heavy pack:
All that concerned him was to fill
His tucker bags from day to day.
When next I met him, making out
To western huts and shearing sheds,
He had a sturdy hack to ride,
A packhorse jogging by his side.
Then grass was what he talked about,
And water for his quadrupeds.
When next the battler crossed my track
He had no time for plodders slow;
For in a gig, an envied bloke,
He sat serenely puffing smoke,
And carried feed for ways outback,
Where feed through drought had ceased to
grow.
When once again I met old Bill
He’d had a rise; he drove a car!
A real old flivver, yet ’twas grand
To see him chugging down the land,
With roll and bump o’er plain and hill,
A new-born swell from Gwabegar.
But now the drovers passed him by,
Since naught he knew of grass or soil;
And scores of old familiar camps
Saw but the flash of passing lamps;
His studies centred, wet or dry,
In places where he’d get some oil.

£25 FOR SUCCESS STORIES .
Mostly Australia hears of her farming failures, but there are many men
on the land who have a romantic record of success—men who started out,
with little capital, on rough scrub land, and made good despite low prices,
bad communications and high taxes; men who bought properties on which
others had failed and made them pay; men who began with nothing but
stock knowledge as capital and turned it to good account; men to whom
pasture improvement has brought a competence.
“The Bulletin” is offering prizes for stories of success in any branch
of farming, written by the parties themselves or by others to whom the facts
have been communicated. If the latter, proofs of genuineness must be
furnished.
First prize . . £2O
Second prize £3
Third prize £2
And ten “Bulletin” drawings by well-known artists. Space rates will
be paid for all non-prizewinning efforts published.
A story must not exceed eight hundred words in length. It must be
sent in an envelope addressed to the Editor and marked “Success Competition”
not later than January 31 next. The Editor’s decisions and awards will

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
FLY-BLOW CONTROL.
“G.H.H.”: Lucilia cuprina has been
classified as a primary fly, i.e., it oviposits
on carrion in early stages of decay,
whereas secondary flies like CJirysomia
rufifacies, which have a rough-skinned or
hairy maggot, start to lay eggs at a
much later sequence in decay.
Experiments show the growth of
maggots to be proportional to the amount
of suitable food imbibed. If the food is
limited, growth may be very slow, and
perhaps never be completed. Probably,
under ordinary conditions, no maggot
can thrive on normal sheep, but as soon
as the right bacteria break down tissues
to release suitable constituents the
maggot can take advantage of the food
so prepared, and grow in keeping with
the supply.
Maggots repeatedly put on sheep in
thousands have failed to cause trouble
even in wet weather. When, however, a
sheep so treated was associated with an
animal with water-rot, but not maggoty,
the maggots on the clean sheep thrived
and all stages of fly-blow developed.
Maggots left free to wander on healthy
skin do not remain where placed. When
confined in a cage to one spot on the
skin of an animal apparently healthy
they cause irritation. Exudation starts
through the skin, and the maggots grow.
This may be due more to the artificial
conditions set up by the cage than to the
innate habits of the maggots.
Experiments with maggots used to
cure the bone disease Osteomyelitis
strongly suggest this.
Nevertheless, skin-exudation experi-
ments yield useful inferences.
Some sheep are more susceptible to
water-rot than others, so it is good to
eliminate susceptible animals from a
flock, but the question remains how to
protect susceptible sheep. Jetting, dipping
and swabbing with arsenical solutions
are only effective for a short time, and it
has been asserted that the after-effects
leave the wool specially susceptible to
attack.
A sheep once struck is liable to be re-
peatedly struck, so presumably the solu-
tions are harmless to predisposing bac-
teria.
No traps can deal with the principal
offender, though trials have led to all
sorts of hazy theories about them. Any
benefit from them is indirect. They do
not deal with water-rot organisms, which
may be carried by the hands and
clothing of shearers as well as by flies.
Little is known about the water-rot
bacteria, but apparently they are ever
present on sheep and, like milk germs,
become dangerous only when sufficiently
dense. It seems, also, that only some
water-rot organisms—or perhaps only a
complex of them —can produce the con-
dition suitable for maggot life.
Humidity is the first essential to their
growth; hence frequent breech strike.
In wet weather, strike is as liable to start
anywhere else on the body as below the
tail. Frequent attempts to obtain growth
of maggots in the faeces-contaminated
wool (free of water-rot) have failed.
A leading expert has expressed the view
that the fly-blow problem is one for the
bacteriologist, not the entomologist or
chemist.
No longer is it a case of controlling
the incidence of blowflies, since 30 years
on this type of action have failed, but of
controlling the bacteria on the sheep.
Along these lines the industry and its
research workers should begin to think.
“Albarmount”: Despite “W.D.McC.”
(B. 5/12/’34), I did use an arsenical-
powder solution, and closely followed
the manufacturer’s "how-to-use” direc-
tions. That the flies were troubling the
sheep a fortnight afterwards goes to
show how determined they were. Cer-
tainly there were more dead than live
maggots, but enough of the latter to war-
rant dressing.
My sheep usually have two months’
immunity from fly-attack after dipping.
But despite this I would not recommend
the building of dips for this purpose
alone, particularly where suitable
material and sites are not available. To
get worth-while results, periodical dip-
pings would have to be carried out; and,
apart from knocking the sheep about,
dip action seems to clam the dirt into
the fibre, adversely affecting the appear-
ance of the wool.
SHRINKAGE OF WOOL.
“Valerin”: An understanding of what
it means will save heartburning between
neighbors whose wool is of similar type
and whose prices often vary.
Shrinkage is the amount of foreign
matter or “waste” removed from a parcel
of wool when scoured and rendered fit
for machining, the balance being termed
the “clean yield.”
On this clean yield and the value of
the top, i.e., the combed article, the
value per pound of greasy wool is based.
Both shrinkage and yield are worked out
on a percentage basis.
There are many factors which influ-
ence both —feed, seasons, overstocking,
climate, characteristics of soil, dust, etc.
For instance, sheep generously fed
produce a heavy-conditioned wool which
loses weight in scouring. On the other
hand, starved sheep will grow a thin,
tender-stapled wool which gives a good
yield in the scour, but shows a consider-
ably higher shrinkage in combing into
ops and spinning into yarns. Obviously
dust, burr and vegetable matter reduce
the clean-scoured yield.
It has been estimated that average
combing 64’s, grown under normal con-
ditions, of the three representative dis-
tricts of N.S.W. yield as follows:
Upper Darling and Far West wools,
40 to 41 p.c.
Riverina wools, 44 to 45 p.c.
New England and Yass wools, 47 to
48 p.c.
Of course, for superior and good wools
the yield is much higher.
A rough-and-ready method of ascer-
taining what a particular line of your
wool will yield on a clean-scoured basis
is to take a pound of it, wash thoroughly
with soap and water and dry. The
scoured product will be the actual yield,
and the percentage is easily calculated.
PIECE-PICKING.
“Marsh”: “Toowong's” (B. 28/11 /’34)
scheme for piece-picking and wool-
rolling conjointly will not get a hearing
from many wool-classers.
“The method is as applicable to a
board of 40 shearers as to one of four,”
claims “Toowong.” Using such a system,
and with very average shearers on
a 40-stand board, the shed hands would
be smothered in wool.
With only 4000 sheep being shorn
daily, and the usual complement of roll-
ing tables, how can two fleeces (there
will be two a minute hitting each table)
be properly handled, as “Toowong”
maintains? You’re not going to get the
shearers to steady up.
How can pieces be picked and sorted
with portions of fleeces lying over the
sides of the rolling tables? “Toowong’s”
method might be applicable where four
shearers are employed—and then it’s not
to be recommended—but not for 40. It’s
a great method for the dumping of
pieces.
PART-TENDER WOOLS.
“Marsh”: “Narooma” (B. 14/11 /’34)
suggests that I’m too drastic in condemn-
ing classers for not thoroughly over-
hauling every fleece for signs of tender-
ness. He says with over 1400 fleeces to
be handled daily a classer has neither
the time nor the space to open every
fleece and sound it.
With a boy carrying away, I found
time to do what “Narooma” says is im-
possible, with 40 shearers giving me
around 4500 fleeces daily. I received no
complaints about the get-up of that clip,
and it was partly sound and partly
tender.
To attempt to smother-up partly-tender
fleeces in a sound line is paramount to
false packing. It’s the easiest way to
limit competition if the odd fifty-fifty
fleeces are found by buyers.
It’s far more payable to isolate all
doubtful fleeces, even though the former
are only a few and have to be bagged.
BARLEY V. WHEAT.
“Mat.”: There is much for poultry-
farmers to ponder over in the result of
the 1933-34 Maoriland poultry-station
test at Wallaceville. Before the test
began, in April, 1933, 100 birds were
penned for a few days, and afterwards
divided into 50’s—one half to be fed on
barley and the other on wheat.
Both pens received mash meals in the
early morning and at midday. The grain
was given in the evening in litter. The
green food was silver beet and young
green oats.
The barley-feds ate 7431 b. barley-meal.
3251 b. pollard, 4181 b. bran, 3251 b. wheal-
meal and 49.36 bushels barley. The
other pen devoured 7201 b. wheatmeal,
3151 b. pollard, 4051 b. bran, 2821 b. meat-
meal and 41.6 bushels wheat.
The barley-feds’ tucker cost £l4 17s.
5d., and they laid 8268 eggs which real-
ised £37 18s. 5d. —a profit of £23 Is.
The wheat-fed birds’ bill was £l5 6s.
74d., and their eggs realised £37 9s. 4ld.
—a profit of £22 2s. 9d. It cost s|d. to
produce each dozen barley-fed eggs
against 5-ld. for the wheat-feds, while
the gross profit per bird was 9s. for
barley-feds and Bs. for wheat-feds.
The cost of grit was.not included, and
was estimated at 12s. to 14s. per pen.
While the figures are much in favor of
barley-feeding, local market prices must
be considered. In the test barley aver-
aged 3s. 5.35 d. per bushel and wheat
4s. 5.25 d. per bushel. The poultryman
must therefore, make deductions to suit
the district.
EIGHT SILAGE POINTS.
“R.R.M.”: “Spring” (B. 5/12/’34) has
failed to take into account several facts
against hay.
(1) Ensilage can be made from any
green, succulent feed, and in almost any
weather. For hay the choice is limited
and weather is important.
(2) Silage considerably increases the
palatability and digestibility of fodder.
(3) Ensilage has much less bulk than
hay, and consequently is cheaper to
handle—so to 60 cub. ft. equals one
ton, while 400 to 500 cub. ft. of oaten
or wheaten hay and 300 to 400 cub. ft.
of lucerne hay equals one ton.
(4) Ensilage can be kept indefinitely
without fear of loss from fire or vermin
or rain.
(5) For silage wheat or oats will cut
7 to 10 tons and lucerne 4 to 6 tons per
acre against 1 to H tons and 1 to 1| tons
respectively for hay. To put away 100
tons of ensilage it is necessary to cut
only 20 to 25 acres. To make the same
weight of hay cut-off 75 to 100 acres
would be needed.
(6) The same weight is taken out after
an indefinite period as was originally
put in the pit; whereas one week after
a stack of hay is completed the loss in
weight is 10 p.c., and after 12 months the
loss is a further 10 p.c.
(7) The same weight of either ensilage
or hay is required to feed stock ; 2 to 2\
pounds per sheep, and 20 to 25 pounds
per head for cattle. To feed 1000 sheep
it is therefore necessary to handle only
50 to 60 cub. ft. of silage against 300
to 400 cub. ft. of hay. Ensilage is eaten
and relished with no waste whatever.
With hay here is a 10 p.c. loss because
the hard, dry stalk ends are not eaten.
(8) For lambing ewes and dairy cows
especially, ensilage has a far greater value
than hay. Ensilage has the same milk-
producing qualities as green feed; and
when the stock are getting a proportion

of rough dry feed in the paddock en-
silage is particularly beneficial on ac-
count of its laxative properties.
PROTEIN ECONOMY.
“Molecule”: A balanced ration sup-
plies protein for flesh and bone forma-
tion, milk production, wool growth, etc.,
and carbohydrates (heat-producers) for
maintaining body temperature and energy
for working the vital organs. Any protein
in excess of the quantity needed can be
used by animal or bird for heat and
energy purposes, but any surplus of
carbohydrates can not perform the func-
tions of protein. Fat formation is the
only purpose to which carbohydrate sur-
plus can be applied.
The nutritive ratio —protein to carbo-
hydrates—is subject to wide variation,
according to the nature and age of the
animal, climatic or seasonal conditions,
etc.
A cow milking and in calf needs a
great deal of protein, a ratio of about
1 to 4\ ; whilst a mature steer can main-
tain its condition and even put on fat on
a ratio as wide as 1 to 14.
Protein-rich feeds are almost always
dearer than carbonaceous feeds, so that
the stockowner, whilst taking care to feed
enough suitable protein, should know that
an oversupply is wasteful. A carbona-
ceous supplement, such as maize, may
give results as good as a feed richer in
protein and better balanced. The ex-
planation is that the maize, supplying
abundance of assimilable heat and
energy, leaves the whole of the protein in
the remainder of the ration for productive
purposes, where previously part of it had
been performing the function of a carbo-
hydrate. This explains why molasses is
such a useful feed in cold weather. It
contains no protein, but its readily avail-
able, heat- and energy-producing units
are protein-saving.
WIPING OUT NOOGOORA.
“Noogoora”: With practical experi-
ence of the pest I find it cheaper to
accept' a depreciated price for my wool
than to spend money on a probably
hopeless battle.
Naturally, the authorities would like
to assist, but may be led into taking
uneconomic measures by the outcry of
people without practical experience.
Much of our wool has to be carbon-
ised by reason of vegetable intrusions
which, though not as conspicuous as
Noogoora, may be equally as expensive
to remove.
I understand the C.S.I.R. has the
matter in hand. I suggest it try to
find out exactly what the disability per
pound of wool amounts to.
FLOODGATES.
“Marsh”: “Doitnow’s” floodgate of
No. 8 wire (B. 21/11/’34), fastened down
the middle with heavy tie-wire and firmly
secured to anchored posts on each
creek-bank, is, like most other floodgates,
serviceable until a decent flood brings
down plenty of debris. It’s questionable
then which is the easier, to find the two
wire gates among the rubbish and heavy
washed-down timber or call some fresh
wire into use.
I’ve tried scores of different contrap-
tions, and found a stout cable over-
head, with rails suspended from it by
pliable wire, to require the least attention
after the waters had subsided.
Rails have a chance of lifting with the
water as it rises, but a hefty log ensnared
in “Doitnow’s” wire gate will result in
the obvious if th'e fresh is strong in
volume.
POST-SINKING.
“Sprinkler”: Here are some facts for
“Peggoty” (B. 14/11/’34) about post-
sinking in loose downs country in n.-w.
Queensland.
Over 50 years back the late Isaac Little
erected sheep-fences on Austral Downs
(N.T.). None of those posts has ever
been resunk, and some of them are stand-
ing to this day. On Warenda (Boulia)
improvements were made about ’B5. The
woolshed paddock, adjoining the head
station, has fences which were among the
first erected. They have never been resunk,
and most of the country is loose downs.
One of the oldest fences between the
Flinders and the Diamantina was at the
old Hamilton Downs homestead, now on
Dimora. That, a cattle-fence originally,
but converted to sheep for many years,
still stands up to its job. I could men-
tion hundreds of miles of other fencing,
equally old, equally stable, and on downs
which are just as loose.
Briefly, I don’t know of any fence
properly erected which has had to be
resunk—iron-posts, of course, excepted.
A post reversed should not topple over.
The reason for the big end going in the
ground is to give the thing stability and
grip-
PICKLING MUTTON.
“Valerin”: For dry-curing mutton take
•jib. coarse salt, a dessertspoon of brown
sugar, a teaspoon of ground salt-
petre, some pepper and allspice. Mix
well and rub well into the meat, especi-
ally where bones have been taken out.
Pack into a small tub and put away in
a cool spot where the flies cannot get
at it. Turn every day for three days,
then press for one night under a heavy
weight and hang up in a cool place.
For wet pickling, boil enough water
to cover the meat and other ingredients.
Pack the meat into small cask and
pour the cold brine over it. Leave it
for a week, turning the meat every day,
then treat as for dry curing. Meat so
treated should keep from 10 to 14 days
in the hottest weather.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Roy R.”: To make a light for windy
work fill a fruit-tin three parts full of
sand. Next wrap a thin piece of pine in
enough chaffbag to make the size of the
thumb. Push it through the centre of the
sand to the bottom of the tin. Fill from
the sand to the top of the tin with old fat.
Smear the top of the wick with fat. Cut
one side out of a kerosene-tin, fit a
handle and put the lamp inside.
“E.S.”: A valuable fodder-plant of
creeping habit is Warrigal spinach,
plentiful along the Flinders and Thomp-
son rivers. As its leaves assuage thirst,
it is esteemed for both man and beast.
Each plant covers several feet of ground,
and grows freely in the hottest and driest
weather. Having binding roots and
favoring sandy situations, it is suitable for
planting where sand-drifts are common.
“Optic”: Try sugar for pink-eye. Just
grind it fine and sprinkle it in the eye.
When we began to use it years ago our
troubles ended.
“Stump Jump”: The best dressing for
sore teats I know is roughly 1 tablespoon
of clear tar-extract stirred into a lib. tin
of Shell vaseline (costing 10d.). Melt
the vaseline in the tin, adding the extract
when the jelly is half set. Stir quickly
to emulsify, as otherwise the two will
not mix.
“Hope Vale”: A useful waterbag
stand and preserver can be made with a
piece of board and two lengths of hoop-
iron. Cut the board to fit the bottom of
the bag. Fasten the two hoop-iron strips
to the bottom of the board, bend up
both ends of each piece and rivet to the
handle. The bag will then stand on the
ground without tipping over, and the
bottom will not be punctured or soiled
by contact with the ground.
“Agri”: I have used sheepskins with
woolly side out, not in (B. 21/11/ ’34),
beneath the collars of hard-working farm
horses. Galls are kept moist, and soon
heal. The woolly side acts as a spring-
cushion. Pelts taken off a few weeks
after shearing are best.
“Nedos”: I disagree with “Trepex”
(B. 5/12/’34) that it pays to keep board
and table locks separate. Board locks
are made up of small pieces, some clean
and some stained. I find it pays to have
the picker-up shake out all big pieces and
give them to the piece-picker, where they
are sorted into their proper lines. When
this is done “Trepex” will find that table
and board locks are very alike and scour
up well together.
“J.M.C.”: According to Mr. W. H.
Treweeke, of Umbercolli, near Goondi-
windi (Q.), quantities of ’hoppers on a
huge egg bed there are being killed by a
small, black insect —probably the chalcid
wasp, which was introduced in W.Q.
sheep country to deal with the blowfly.

ALL RIGHT IN THEORY.
“Some bowlers do their best work under
encouragement by the captain, while others
respond magnificently when told they are
‘bowling like old women.’ ”
—W. J. O’Reilly.
I used this method years ago, but gave
it up the season we played the Snodge’s
Flat Smiters for the inter-district cham-
pionship. Two of their best sloggers were
well set, and belting the cover off every-
thing sent up by my two best trundlers
—ring-ins, unknown to me. It was about
112 deg. in the shade, and inability to
break the partnership had caused tempers
to fray somewhat.
As the left-arm medium-paced bowler,
a fellow with a shock of fiery-red hair,
was going back to bowl again after
being hit for four successive sixers 1
went up to him, patted him on the back
and said: “Keep at it, old man, you’re
doing well. He’ll fall for that trap on
the boundary in a few more hits.” He
turned on me quite savagely and
snapped: ‘‘Keep y’ mug shut, y’ lizard,
or I’ll dong yer! ”
At the end of his over the other fellow,
named McShamus, took up the attack.
His first ball was wide and went for
four byes. His second and third went
over the boundary. It was no use kidding
to this chap, so I went up to him and
said sternly: “Here, a half-wit could
push them up better than that. Don’t
amble up to the crease like a hamstrung
brontosaurus —put some snap into it or
I’ll take you off!” Usually when I say
something like that they tear in with a
‘tremendous burst of enthusiasm.
This fellow did, too. The vice-captain,
when the matron allowed him eventually
to see me, broke the gentle news that

THE GOOD ABOUT CHRISTMAS.
There’s something good about Christ-
mas. There’s no doubt about it! Al-
though, knowing exactly what it means,
the cheerful politeness of everybody
makes me shiver, and 1 have to buy
things for other people I can't afford,

QUITE NATURAL.
“A recent invention will allow the surgeon to
study the brain at work.”
The surgeon paused, completely
puzzled.
Something must have gone wrong
with the instrument, for although
the patient’s brain was distinctly visible
the dial (of the instrument) gave a nega-
tive reading. He rang urgently for a
mechanic.
The machine was given a thorough
test and pronounced to be in per-
fect order. A mild thrill went through
the surgeon. A new medical freak, eh?
What would his colleagues have to say
about this? And wouldn’t he have the
laugh on his old friend Carvem the
alienist, who had always jeered at the
possibility of a “live” brain with no
movement whatever?
He was still pondering the rare pheno-
menon when the “resident” came along.
“By the way,” he said, “be careful
with this case. That’s Blobb, our local
member.”

NO GOOD.
The farmer’s only horse died of senile
decay, and he had come into the town-
ship to look for another.
“I’ve got one that ought to suit you
down to the ground,” said the local auc-
tioneer, leading the way to an enclosure
wherein several mokes left over from the
last sale day were brooding over the
dreariness of life in a confined area from
which every vestige of grass had long
since disappeared. .
“That horse over there,” he said, point-
ing to a large and scraggy roan, “is easily
the most willing in the yard. He hasn’t
a lazy bone in his body, and, what’s
more, he’s reliable, too. He can’ always
be depended upon to do his 30 miles a
day without stopping.”
“Well, he'd be no good t’ me Ihen,”
drawled the cocky. “J on’y live 20 mile
out, and if I was t’ leave it t’ ’im t’ git
me ’ome I’d always ’ave t’ walk 10 mile
back.”

CHOOSING BOOKS.
I am often asked “What is a suitable
book for a girl of 19 who doesn’t believe
in Santa Claus and has odd ideas about
the facts of life?” or “What kind of
book should I give grandma? She is
92, has lost all her teeth, her sense of
hearing and most of her money, and she
plays the zither.”
Obviously the same book would hardly
be suitable for both cases, and careful
consideration is necessary. . For the girl
the natural choice is the “Encycloptedia
Britannica.” In this she will find all she
wants to know, but it will take her so
long to find it that it won’t really do her
much harm. Also she will pick up much
useful information on the way.
Granny’s case is a little more difficult.
Remember, she is 92, and if you start
her on the “Encyc. Brit.” she probably
won’t have time to get past the first
volume. After all, you don’t want to
throw money away. No, the best thing
for her is something light—“ Purple Pas-
sion” or something of that type. Of
course, her interest in it will be purely
academic, but it may serve to keep her
mind off the zither.
These are extreme cases, but everyone
wants to give a book to someone some-
time. The gift may either be taken from
one’s own collection or bought. The
former method is the cheaper, but books
thus chosen should be either very old
or very new. If the book is sufficiently
old it doesn’t matter if it is soiled and
tattered and has the names of several
previous owners in it. These, in fact, en-
hance its value. If it is new, however,
it must not have any names at all in it,
not even your own. Make it a rule,
therefore, never to put your name in
your books unless they have two fly-
leaves.
Buying a book is a different matter. I
have seen it done this way.
Scene: Book department of large
store. Characters: One customer, one
assistant.
Customer opens conversation brightly,
“1 want to buy a book.” Assistant, rather
surprised at such a remark but deter-
mined not to show it, counters with
“What kind?”
“Oh, about 25.” “We have a nice line
in green here.” “Haven’t you any red?”
“Yes, madam. All this shelf.” “Thanks,
I’ll take one. Will you wrap it up,
please?”
It shouldn’t really be done this way.
The best bookshops nowadays divide
their stock on the lines of Hymns A. and
M. This is an excellent plan. In times
gone by “Those at Sea” often found
themselves cluttered up with books in-
tended “For Lay Helpers,” while tomes
intended “For the Young” were a potent
cause of indigestion among “Those of
Riper Years.”
Of course, there are degrees of ripe-
ness, and some people are more at sea
than others, while I should not be sur-
prised if there were such things as young
Lay Helpers. That is where personal
judgment comes in. After all, I can’t do
everything for you.
A final word of warning. Don’t go
by titles, or you may find yourself dis-
appointed like the young girl who bought
herself a book entitled “Fun to Hug,”
only to find that it was the third volume
of an encyclopaedia.

PLAYING THE ODD.
Colonel Smiter found his ball lying
in a hole near a stump. Never had a
golf ball been in a more awkward posi-
tion. He selected a club and made a
vicious swipe. The club head flew off.
The air became purple for a few
minutes; then he took another club. Just
as he swung a little man rushed up and
shouted “Hey!” Smiter broke the second
club.
“Dammit, sir,” shouted the colonel,
“what d’you mean by interrupting me
like that?” And he fiercely took an-
other stick. The little man shouted
again, and the club suffered the same
fate as the others. The colonel selected
yet another; but this one he used on
the little man.
“There! That might teach you,” he
bellowed as the little man sank to the
ground.
The victim groaned ; then just before
he lost consciousness he murmured, “I
—just—wanted to tell you that you’re
playing my ball. Yours is in the hole.”

Information Sought.
How many times did Jimmy Clabby and
Tommy Uren meet ? What were the results
of their contests, and did Uren ever knock
Clabby out ?— 4642.
Ten times. Uren won six times on points,
Clabby three times. Their other clash resulted
in a draw.
(1) Is a batsman out when, after being struck
on the head by the ball, he staggers and
knocks the wicket down ? (2) When a batsman
knocks his wicket down with the bat in making
the stroke, does that wicket go to the bowler ?
—4521.
(1) No. (2) Yes.
(1) What were the conditions under which
the recent speed and handicap air races from
England to Melbourne were run ? (2) Why were
the Dutch and American fliers who came in
second and third disqualified ? (3) Is the
nominator of the ’plane or the pilot entitled
to the prize? —42B3.
(1) Too lengthy to print here. They were
published in full beforehand. (2) They were
not disqualified. There were no disqualifica-
tions of competitors who finished the course.
Both of these entries had nominated for both
the speed and handicap sections of the races.
After handicap allowances had been made it
was found that the Dutch entry had put up
the best performance in the handicap section,
and, as the first prize for the handicap race
was £2OOO, the Dutchmen elected to accept that
rather than the second prize of £l5OO for the
speed race, and this they did. The American
entry moved up into second place when the
Dutchmen voluntarily withdrew their claim to
second prize. (3) The nominator.
(1) Is the intermediate examination of a
higher standard in Vic. than in N.S.W., and
in what way do they differ ? (2) Pupils in the
former State take the leaving the year follow-
ing the intermediate, and are allowed to sit
again the same year in any subject they fail to
pass in the inter. Is this possible in N.S.W. ?
4735.
(1). The standard of the intermediate certifi-
cate of Vic. is somewhat similar to that of
N. S. Wales. (2) The leaving certificate exam,
of N.S.W. is taken after two years of post-
intermediate work. It is not the practice for
pupils to sit again in the following year for
individual subjects in which they failed to pass
at the intermediate certificate exam.
At a recent military gathering were several
soldiers wearing blue tunics with polished metal
epaulettes. Are the latter for use or ornament,
and of what significance are they ? —4738.
The uniform described belongs to the Legion
of Frontiersmen, who wear shoulder chains
of burnished chain mail. These shoulder chains
are part of the service dress of various over-
seas cavalry regiments. They were worn by
2nd King Edward’s Horse, an Empire cavalry
regiment in which many Australians served
during the war, and several native Indian
cavalry regiments still wear them. They origi-
nated in India many years ago, where most
or the wounds inflicted by the tulwar, or curved
native sword, occurred on the shoulders or
neck.
(1) What is the period of enlistment in the
Light Horse ( militia ) ? (2) Must troopers pro-
vide their own mounts ? (3) Must horses be
of any particular standard ? What allowance
does a trooper receive for his horse? (5) Does
the Government compensate for injury or loss
of horse ? —4652.
(1) Three years. (2) Each man must either
own his horse or be able to hire it whenever
required. Horses are not provided by military
authorities. (3)' Horses must pass inspection
by troop or squadron officer and by veterinary
officer if considered necessary. Height, 15-17
hands. Must be sound in wind and limb and
able to carry trooper with full equipment over
an unlimited period. Bays and browns are
preferred, but lighter colors are not objected
to. (4) Five shillings per day for all parades
and camps. Horsefeed and all equipment are
provided by military. (5) Government may
compensate up _to £25 if horse is definitely
injured on service. Owners of horses valued
beyond that amount must insure privately or
carry risk themselves.
(1) What is the difference between a dragoon
and a hussar ? (2) Is the lance considered a
better fighting weapon than the sword ? (3)
Are the A.L.H. cavalry regiments ? —4670.
(1) Dragoons are heavy cavalry, hussars light
cavalry, but these distinctions really belong to
last century. Trench warfare, barbed wire
and mechanisation of warfare have narrowed
the sphere of cavalry action, and resulted to
some extent in the absorption of cavalry regi-
ments in other arms. (2) A debatable questimi.
Both lance and sword are used for thrusting
purposes nowadays—the sabre or cutting sword
was scrapped by the British Army early in the
Great War for the present narrow-bladed
thrusting sword. The lance gives slightly longer
reach, but is not so handy in a melde. In any
case, lancer regiments carry swords as well.
The advantage rendered by the lance for shock
action may be balanced by its impediment
to dismounted action. (3) In the Great War
the Light Horse regiments were, until near the
end of the Palestine campaign, purely mounted
infantry. They were armed with rifle and
bayonet only, the horses giving the advantage
of mobility over the infantry. The addition
of swords to their equipment changed the status
of the A.L.H. to mounted shock-attack units.
They had previously usurped the status by an
unorthodox mounted charge with bayonets.
(1) Procedure for marriage in N.S.W.? (2)
Period of residence required of contracting
parlies ? (3) Fees ? —4433.
(1) and (2) Marriage may be celebrated by
any minister of religion registered for that
purpose, or by the Registrar of the district in
which the intended wife ordinarily resides. No
other residential qualification is necessary. (3)
A fee of £1 ss. is payable in respect of a
marriage by a Registrar. In the case of a
marriage by a minister, the payment of a fee
is a matter between the parties and the cele-
brant.

(1) If a 30 p.c. o.p. rum is left in a demi-
john will it increase or diminish in strength ?
(2) Will a rum which has been reduced in
strength by the addition of water from 30 p.c.
o.p. to 10 p.c. o.p. increase in strength if left
standing for a considerable time in (a) a
wooden cask, (b) a demijohn ? (3) Can rum
be fed by the addition of other liquor or dried
fruit so as to (a) modify, (b) strengthen it ?
(4) What effect would the addition of (a) a good
port wine, (b) raisins, in the proportion of a
pint of port wine or a pound of raisins to a
gallon of o.p. rum, have on the rum ? —4291.
(1) Provided the demijohn is properly sealed,
no alteration should take place. (2) If the spirit
is stored in a wooden cask it should decrease
in contents by evaporation, but there would be
a gradual increase in strength. If stored in a
demijohn properly sealed, there would be no
evaporation and no alteration in strength.
(3) and (4) The addition of raisins, port wine
or other liquid (provided it was not a spirituous
liquor of the same strength or a higher
strength than the rum to which it was added)
would reduce the strength of the rum, but to
what extent cannot be estimated.
Is the wireless ultra-short wave used to any
exteni in the treatment of tuberculosis? —4463.
Not yet established as a specific in the radio-
therapeutic treatment of tuberculosis and allied
organic lesions. London and Continental
hospitals ai*e experimenting, but practical data
on biological effects are still far from complete.
With recent developments in valve design, ultra-
short-wave apparatus has the advantage oyer
former methods of ray therapy in that radia-
tion can be localised to a regulated depth of
penetration. Deductions will be made for re-
port through medium of the-T.B. Council.
How did the U.S.A. become possessed of
Alaska, and when . ? -t4636.
Alaska was purchased by the U.S.A!'from
Russia by the treaty of. 1867. The price,
7,200,000 dollars in gold, was paid on August
1, 1868, no interest being charged. Russia
had been in possession of,Alaska since 1825,
when it was ceded to her by Great Britain.
(1) What is the story of Burne-Jones’s pic-
ture “The Golden Stair,” and when . was it
painted ? (2) Is it true that none of his works
was ever exhibited at the Royal Academy ?
(3) When was he knighted, and why ?—4731.
(1) It appeared in 1880, and has no literary
association, nor does it illustrate any special
historic incident. (2) He never exhibited any
works with the Academy, although he was
elected an associate in 1885 and did not resign
this position until 1893. (3) He was created a
baronet in 1894 for his services to art.
(1) Who invented the dynamo? (2) Particu-
lars of first machine ? —4749.
The dynamo, among other things, was the
outcome of Faraday’s discovery of the genera-
tion of an electric current in a copper wire
by moving it across a strong magnetic field.
In 1865 an Italian physicist, Pacinotti, devised
a crude machine which was reinvented in 1870
by Z. Gramme, a Belgian electrician, in im-
proved form. The armature consisted of a
ring, formed by winding up iron wire, or
tube formed of flat rings of sheet-iron separated
by paper. On this ring was wound an endless
spiral of insulated copper wire divided into
equal sections, each of which was connected to
a commutator segment. This armature revolved
in a strong transverse magnetic field produced
by an electromagnet. It was commonly called
a “Gramme ring.”
Ingredients for a manifold appliance for
making a number of copies of a circular ?
4539.
Melt together 1 part glue, 2 parts water
and 4 parts glycerine, all by weight; evaporate
some of the water by keeping the mixture hot
for a while; in very hot weather use a little
more glue than given above. This mixture
should be poured into a shallow tin pan. so
that the pad sets to about three-eighths of an
inch in thickness. Secure, the tin container
first, measure the liquid contents and make up
the mixture to that amount with the ingredi-
ents in their right proportions. Hectograph
ink can be bought from stationers.
Is it practicable td derive sufficient power
from the rays of the sun to run, for instance,
a condensing plant ? —4259.
Attempts have been made at all stages in
history to devise means to convert solar energy
into work. Some time ago quite an amount of
work was carried out in Philadelphia, U.S.A.,
with a plant which had 10,000 sq. ft. of absorb-
ing surface. An even larger plant with 13,000
sq. ft. of absorbing surface was under test in
Egypt. Neither was successful, owing to the
fact that the steam generated was at a very
low pressure. It appears that the steam engine
is not suitable for use in this particular con-
nection. The whole subject of solar power
was discussed at some length in “World
Power” for October, 1925.
(1) How can fleas on dogs be eradicated ?
(2) What will give a dog a healthy coat? (3)
How to prevent a dog getting distemper ?
—4526.
(1) Apply powdered naphthalene or pyrethrum
powder (which must be fresh and pure).
Destroy the bedding and thoroughly disinfect
the kennel or place where the animal sleeps,
otherwise the dog will shortly be reinfested.
(2) Feed every second day raw meat only, and
feed only once a day. Arsenic in doses of
one-fiftieth to one-tenth of a grain according
to size of dog given once a day over a long
period will also greatly improve a coat. (3)
There is a distemper serum which will pre-
vent the animal getting the disease when ex-
posed to infection. But it is fairly expensive,
and should be administered by a vet.
The fur of my Persian cat becomes very
knotted and matted. Treatment ? —3986.
The condition can be put right by daily
grooming. The coat should be combed and.
brushed against the lie of the hair so as to
remove pieces of dust, etc. In the spring and
autumn, when the coat is changing, cats require
more careful grooming than they do at other
times.
How to smoke eels and fish; equipment,
material and procedure ? — 4392.
All fish, including eels, intended for smok-
ing should be first thoroughly cleaned and all
the blood removed. They should then be
soaked in a solution of salt and water suffici-
ently strong to float a potato. If it is de-
sired to keep the fish for more than two or
three days the soaking in the salt solution
should be for 12 to 24 hours or even longer;
if for two or three days, a soaking for an hour
or two would be sufficient. The longer the fish
are soaked in the salt solution the longer they
will keep, but the less palatable they will prove
to eat. After soaking, they should be hung
up to drain, and when fairly dry they should
be hung in a small shed in the smoke from
hardwood sawdust. A considerable amount of
experience is necessary to secure the proper
amount of smoke without too much heat. The
smoking may require anything from 6 to 24
hours, depending upon the size of the fish and
the extent of smoking required; the longer the
smoking, the longer the fish will keep.

I am a user of soya beans, and have been
told they contain an organic poison. Is this
so ? What is the nature of the poison, and
what effect would it have on the system ?
4397.
They contain nothing of a poisonous
or harmful nature.
What was the ‘‘Commedia dell’Arte” ?
4757..
This refers to the old art of the improvisa-
tore in which the actors went on the stage
with a plotted, scenario, and filled out the play
with their own lines. It came into great
prominence before and during the days of
Moliere, whose genius caught fire from the
old comedy. All the various characterisations —
Harlequin, Columbine, Scaramouche, etc. —
rose from the old farces of the Latins, best
illustrated in the descriptions that have sur-
vived of the old Atellan plays, from the little
town of Atella, not far from Rome.

Maoriland wants the Poet Laureate to

“Third Base”: Once more we are
being assured of an invasion of Ameri-
can baseballers in 1935 —this time by
Charles Root, who pitches for the
Chicago Cubs. Root proposes a visit
from a combination including most of
the best American players rather than
one from two clubs, as happened in 1914,
and suggests that Babe Ruth, the Brad-

“Acme”: The Australian swimmers
who were so struck with the magnificent
pool at Wembley would rub their eyes
if they saw it now. It has been frozen
and converted into the finest ice rink in
the world. A feature this year will be
an international ice carnival in which
Canadians and Americans will take part.
Canucks have already dazzled the locals
with some preliminary displays. The only
other to compare with the Wembley rink
is that at Madison Square Garden, Noo
Yark. There they stage a boxing match
in the morning, and by the afternoon the
arena is flooded, frozen and carrying a
game of hockey.

“Highbury”: “Gunner” (B. 5/12/’34)
falls into a common error when he asso-
ciates the Arsenal Soccer club with Wool-
wich Arsenal; the two have no connec-
tion. Like all the League clubs, Arsenal
is a proprietary show run by a limited-
liability co. Its chief claim to fame,
apart from its football, is its willingness
to pay record prices for likely players—
it gave £lO,OOO for its crack forward
James. It owns a large and well-equipped
ground in the most densely populated
part of London. Gates of 80,000 are just
a circumstance when Arsenal is playing
a dangerous rival “at home,” and the
bank balance is correspondingly fat.

“0.8. J.”: King George is to have a
Silver Jubilee next year, and our Mr.
Lyons is to attend the celebrations. I
think the commemoration of a 25-year
reign is a new idea —in England, any-
how. There are some references in his-
tory to a “National Jubilee” when
George 111. began his 50th year of king-
ship in October, 1809, but I can find
no mention whatever of any official re-
joicings when his quarter-century was in
sight. George 11. would have been en-
titled to a Silver Jubilee in 1751 or there-
abouts, but if any bonfires were lit or
oxen roasted in his honor at' that period
chroniclers are silent about it; possibly
he hadn’t endeared himself to his sub-
jects sufficiently for any such demonstra-
tion of loyalty. The last monarch before
the Hanovers who reigned for 25 years
was Charles 11., and he only just man-
aged it; also, he had so many jubilees
that an official one would probably only
have bored him.

“Whitehall”: To the statement of
“King’s Regs.” (B. 5/12/’34) that in pre-
war days a Guards subaltern “could
easily get by if he had £2OO of his own,”
1 have but one reply—bosh! A Guards
officer has to live in the West End, and
pay West End prices for what he wears
and for most of what he eats and drinks.
He has to join and use the Guards’ Club
and subscribe to the brigade’s sporting
and social organisations, and he is faced
with many other financial obligations
just because he is a Guardsman. I knew
several Guards subalterns early in the
century when I was reading for the
London Bar on £4OO a year—and having
a job to pay my way. Whereas I could
use ’buses and travel third on the under-
ground, they were condemned to the
most expensive forms of transport. An
anchorite couldn’t have lived in the
brigade on £2OO a year, plus pay (say
£5 15s. a week), before the war; and
Guards officers were never encouraged
to be anchorites. The pre-war minimum
for a subaltern was £500; now it is
nearer £lOOO a year. What happened
during the war has nothing to do with
the case (the Guards were campaigning
at the time in Flanders, not in Belgravia
or Mayfair); but even then . tempor-
ary commissions in the brigade were only
given to rich men or the sons thereof.
Let “King’s Regs.” recall the war-time
Guardees of his acquaintance with
“Aussie accents,” and ask himself if so
much as one of them had less than £lOOO
a year over and above pay.

HOW HIGHWAY CASUALTIES CAN BE
PREVENTED.
ADHERENCE TO SAFETY-FIRST PRINCIPLES ESSENTIAL.
BY FRED BERRY.
ALTHOUGH a good deal of latitude in behavior and
forbearance in case of error is usual during the festive
season, motorists should bear in mind that in their particular case
there can be no excuse for carelessness, nor will the sorrow or
pain of accident be one whit lessened by reason of its happening
at this time of the year.
Statistics taken over the last three
years show that the number of accidents
in which vehicles are involved is far
greater in the last week of the old year
and the first of the new year than at
any other period. It is the plain duty
of every motorist to take these facts into
consideration and by adopting safety-
first principles do his bit towards making
the highways safe.
In an endeavor to school themselves
into automatically adopting safety-first
principles it would be a good plan for
motorists to seek the reason for the
thousands of miles of trouble-free motor-
ing enjoyed by competition drivers, who
are not backward so far as speed is con-
cerned, yet who go on year after year
without scratching a mudguard or giving
other road-users the slightest concern.
Subconscious Impression.
The answer is that these people from
the moment the wheel is taken until the
car is safely home keep in the front of
Another British aristocrat follows the aero-dynamic fashion. The new 3 '2-litre

their minds a mental picture of every-
thing within the range of vision. The
movements of all road-users as well as
condition of road surface, corners and
grades are at all times noticed and almost
subconsciously impressed upon the mind.
As a consequence, when an emergency
arises these facts, having been regis-
tered, are taken into consideration, and
combined judgment and instinct auto-
matically do the rest. The hall-mark of
good driving is a capacity for instant
and correct action.
Strangely enough one of the common
errors with inexperienced motorists lies
in maintaining too high a speed right
up to a danger spot. It may be ascribed
to inexperience, but it cannot be excused
on this score, for unless one is quite
definite and certain as to the condition
of affairs “round the corner”—if there
is room for even a shadow of doubt —
there is only one safe course to pursue.
Slow down so that you may pull up
within the range of vision.
Avoiding Accident.
More than half the roadside accidents
happen on bends or corners, the reason
being that only a small percentage of
drivers have bothered to study the science
of cornering—they merely scramble
around.
Steering-gear failure and faulty tyres
are often blamed for these accidents
when, in actual fact, they are not re-
sponsible, the blown tyre or broken
steering arm being the effect and not
the cause. Cornering can hold no terrors
for the driver who is interested in and
has studied his job. Indeed, in these
days of all top-gear driving cornering
provides practically the only really inter-
esting feature of car-handling on the
road.
Corners may be negotiated by one of
three methods. The timid driver will
trail round at low speed, hugging the
inside of the road. The less timid may
skid round at speed emulating the racing
driver, or may adopt the rational plan
of driving round at a normal touring
speed. This last plan is best and safest.
Holding the Wheel.
In learning to corner speedily, yet
safely, one of the first things to be culti-
vated is a correct grip of the steering-
wheel. Though certain sports-type cars
are equipped with steering-wheels in an
almost vertical plane, for practical pur-
poses we may confine our attention to
those with a rake of approximately 45
degrees.
The correct grip will be to rest the
right hand, palm downwards, at the rim
and the fingers turned upwards under-
neath. Likening the wheel to a clock
face, the left hand should grasp it at
eight o’clock, palm facing upwards, and
rim gripped loosely between fingers and
thumb.
Movement of the wheel in deviating
from a straight course depends upon
whether a high- or low-geared steering-
box is There is always a danger
of being caught on full lock with arms
crossedT To avoid this uncomfortable
and dangerous position in operating low-
geared systems, when turning the wheel
more than a quarter-circle the actual
pushing or pulling (turning left or right)
should be done with the right hand, the
Plan of course to steer when cornering. At A speed should

the corner.
grip of the left hand being released, per-
mitting the wheel-rim to slip freely be-
tween the fingers. Then, as the right
hand is about to move to a fresh grip,
the left closes on the wheel-rim, giving
complete control in cases of emergency.
Full lock, left or right, will naturally
demand, two or three movements of the
hands as indicated, but in returning to
normal one should be extremely cautious,
for, although the wheel, due to the self-
centring action of the steering gear, will
usually spin back to centre, it is advisable,
particularly on loose or greasy roads, to
keep positive control throughout the
manoeuvre.
Safe Cornering.
With regard to safety-first in corner-
ing, two hard and fast rules must be
applied: First, slow down before reach-
ing the bend ; second, never apply the
brakes when taking the corner.
Expert drivers accelerate through a
corner, slowing down beforehand, and
so drive the machine in perfect balance
through the arc instead of rendering
the car unstable by applying brakes and
so violently reversing forces.
When negotiating an acute bend it is
good policy to pull out towards the
centre of the road (having regard, of
course, to the convenience of oncoming
traffic). This method has a twofold
advantage. It provides an earlier view
of vehicles coming in the opposite direc-
tion and widens the angle of the corner.
A driver may test his skill in cornering
by noting the position of the car on the
road as he straightens up after the
manoeuvre. Correctly-driven, the car
should leave the actual bend well on the
left side, so complying with traffic regu-
lations and freeing both the car and other
road-users from danger.
Watch Tyre Pressures.
Another safety-first point worthy of
special consideration is the adoption of
rational tyre pressures for all conditions
of load and speed. Under normal con-
ditions the average load seldom exceeds
one-third the maximum load of any given
car, and, as a consequence, a few pounds
air pressure more or less is not of great
moment. Fully laden with passengers
and luggage, however, tyre pressure be-
comes a serious question, lor, unless
all tyres are inflated to a certain definite
pressure, there will be a risk of losing
control in an emergency, and, lurther-
more, the car will be “tender” when cor-
nering at speed. Here motorists may be
reminded that, apart altogether lrom the
aspect of hazard, incorrectly-inflated
tyres, particularly when pressures are
low, will involve them in greater operat-
ing costs than
would be the case
with tyres pump-
ed to makers’ re-
quirements. ■
Expensive
Hobbies.
The dual effect
of speed and
fi er c e accelera-
tion on tyres is
also worthy of
consideration, for
although modern
equipment will
give phenomenal
results under nor-
ma I conditions
the speed mer-
chant and flash
driver pay dearly
for their fun. Experiments have shown
that while every tyre has a definite
potential mileage its life will vary’ in
direct proportion to road speed. Tour-
ing at 30 m.p.h. motorists can expect
tyres to last two and a half times longer
than at 50, while the chap who goes
tearing around at 60 will only get from
his covers one quarter the mileage to be
expected by the cruiser at 30.
Very expensive, too, is the practice of
skidding the wheels either by fierce ac-
celeration or violent brake application ;
and were motorists to realise when driv-
ing a fully laden sedan that skidmarks
were costing them in the neighborhood
of 4d. per yard there would be less
“flash” driving.
As a final warning to the tourist it
should be pointed out that lonely

country roads are not as safe as they
may appear at first glance. Leaving
the car on the roadway round a bend
is fraught with considerable risk ; and,
further, while it is only wasting current
to sound the horn in a busy city street
controlled by traffic police, it is a very
good policy when approaching bends
and cross-roads in the country. One
never knows what is going on just round
the corner, and the unexpected has a
way of happening.

“L.A.”: Wally Davie, boring con-
tractor, left Eromanga alone for Thar-
gomindah (s.-w. Q.), a distance of 109
miles, in an old Dodge tourer. There

had been heavy rain, and all creeks were
in flood. He wrapped the engine in his
camp sheet, and rushed through a creek.
He got across, but a log had lifted in the
corduroy crossing, and he broke the off
front spring. A billet of bush timber,
jambed in between axle and chassis and
secured with Cobb and Co. twitches of
No. 8 wire, gave improvised support,
but the billet twisted at a bump and
locked the steering. The Dodge failed
to live up to its name in the matter of a
mulga-tree, and a twisted front chassis
member had to be straightened with a
sledge-hammer (for an anvil) and the
back of an axe. Count of the number
of times he was bogged was not taken.
He extemporised, with bush timber and
wire, a bridge over one deep, narrow
creek, and ' plunged through several
gutters, waist deep in water, with his
engine wrapped in the camp sheet. Three
miles from Thargomindah he left the
car and started to walk, the last creek
being a swim. He
had then been
live days on the
road. Returning
along the same
road a fortnight
later, after fur-
ther storms,
Davie bogged in
the bed of a creek
16 miles out; a
bearing - bolt
broke and two
pistons were
smashed. Di g-
ging a pit under
the car, he lay in
six inches of
soupy slush and
removed the
sump and broken
parts, stoppered
the two cylinders
and valve re-
cesses with plugs cut and shaped
with an axe from gum saplings,
levered the car out with rails, and
limped into Norley station on two
cylinders in low gear. There he secured
pistons from an old ’bus on the scrap
heap, made a temporary front spring
main leaf from a buggy-tyre, and battled
on to Eromanga—ll days to travel 218
miles!

“Hippolyte”: 1 was running along the
road from Urandangie (W.Q.) one dark
night. An old draught horse was stand-
ing clear of the road. He was just out-
side the sharp edge of the beam of the
headlights, and was petrified with aston-
ishment. I whizzed past him at about
25, and there was an awful smash behind.
I should have remembered that a horse
in those cases almost invariably dives
forward blindly immediately the glare of
the lights has passed him. This fellow
did that. He had flung himself bodily -
into the empty back seat of the tourer.

located, and how are they slacked off ? Also,
what is the small knob on top of the bolthead
which looks like an indicator ?
Front main bearing bolts go right through
engine, and heads are located behind timing
cover plate. Centre bolts (square heads) on
bottom ends go through block. Nuts are on
top ends—one inside valve cover plate below
carburettor, the other outside the block on the
near side. Rear bolts come down from top
of engine (round-headed, flat on one side).

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
hag real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

SHORT-WAVE PROS AND CONS.
(No.3.)
BY DON B. KNOCK.
Many short-wave experimenters have for years used receivers employing
a regenerative triode detector with good results. Better sensitivity, smoother
regeneration control and higher audio gain can be obtained with a screen-grid
valve or R.P. pentode as detector, but the correct audio coupling must be used.
There are countless short-wave listeners
who make their own simply-constructed
receivers, and who enjoy perfectly good
reception. Until two or three years ago
most of these experimental receivers used
a low-impedance triode as detector. Fol-
lowed by transformer coupling or re-
sistance, it would appear that here was
the ideal arrangement. Upon trying a
screen-grid valve as detector, no apparent
benefit resulted when merely making a
change of valve, and many considered
that the advantages of the screen-grid
valve used thus were overrated. The
trouble was that such experimenters over-
looked the coupling requirements of the
two valves, which are widely different.
The main difficulty in putting the screen-
grid type of valve to work is the neces-
sity for a very high impedance load in
the plate circuit.
In order to obtain maximum amplifica-
tion from any valve, the load in the plate
circuit must have an impedance several
times greater than the plate impedance
of the valve. This plate impedance, in
the case of screen-grid valves, is any-
thing from 300,000 to 1,000,000 ohms, so
that it is difficult to provide a load of
sufficiently high impedance to get the
maximum output without at the same
time greatly reducing the voltage avail-
able at the plate, because of the exces-
sive voltage drop across the load. The
best solution is the high-impedance audio
choke, as with this a sufficiently high
impedance can be obtained with a very
small D.C. resistance, provided that the
Fig. 1.—A two-valve regenerative short-wave receiver using
a screen-grid detector and choke-transformer coupling.
Suitable valves would be Mullard PM12A detector and
PM2DX audio.
inductance of the choke is high enough.
There are to-day one or two such chokes
on the market, notably those made by
A.W.A. and Lekmek. For example, a
300 henry choke has an impedance to
currents of 5000 cycles frequency of
somewhere around 950,000 ohms. Obvi-
ously transformer coupling in its simplest
form cannot be used, although a parallel
resistance-transformer combination has
certain merits. Even the best trans-
formers have far too low a primary
inductance to suit the plate circuit of a
screen-grid valve, but this can be raised
in effect by choke or resistance feeding
the transformer primary.
An example of this is illustrated in
Fig. 1. This shows the usual two-valve
receiver with regeneration, in this case
controlled by a variable series capacity
in with the feedback coil. The choke
CH is coupled to the transformer by the
.01 mfd. mica condenser C 5. R 5 is a
10,000-ohm decoupling resistor, and C 6
a 1 mfd. decoupling condenser. The im-
portance of decoupling has been dealt
with previously (B. 29/8/’34). The
choke, where this method of feeding a
transformer coupling is considered, can
be substituted by a resistor with a value
of 100,000 ohms. If the B supply is of
a higher voltage than usual, 250 volts for
example, this resistor could be increased
to 250,000 ohms with advantage. With
low B voltage, resistance as low as
50,000 ohms can be used in this trans-
former-feeding scheme quite success-
fully.
Fig. 2 shows a circuit diagram of the
Wide-World Two type of receiver (as
described B. 15/8/’34), in which the load
is provided solely by a high-impedance
choke. These chokes are no more ex-
pensive than a good audio transformer,
and this type of coupling is infinitely pre-
ferable to either resistance or resistance-
transformer coup-
ling. There are
many types of
audio transformers
with sufficiently
high secondary im-
pedance which can
be used in a circuit
of this nature as
a high-impedance
choke by merely
connecting the
primary and sec-
ondary windings in
series. One suit-
able transformer is
th e well - known
Philips, which may
still be obtained
from second-hand
supply stores and other sources. When a
transformer is used thus it is necessary
to ensure that the two windings are in
the right sense, or their inductances will
cancel instead of helping each other.
With most transformers the terminals P
and C negative are connected together,
and the other two regarded as the choke
terminals; but, as some makes of trans-
formers appear to have the start and
finish of the windings doubtfully indi-
cated, some experimentation for best re-
sults may be needed.
High-impedance audio coupling by the
choke method is an advantage wherever
a screen-grid valve is used as a detector.
Another instance of this was shown in
the Regenerative Reflex All-wave Super-
het (B. 21/11 /’34), where the choke is
in the plate circuit of the 687 duo-diode-
pentode.
Adjustment of Voltages.
Considering the regenerative detector,
as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, it is seen
that in Fig. 1 the connections are the
same as for a triode detector, except for
the screen-grid. In Fig. 2 the detector
is of the electron-coupled type, with
cathode coil in place of plate coil, and
the suppressor grid earthed; the 77
being an R.F. pentode with free sup-
pressor. The screen-grid in each case
is supplied by a 50,000-ohm poten-
tiometer, by-passed by a condensor which
may be anything from .01 to 1 mfd.
Although in Fig. 1 oscillation is con-
trolled by the variable condenser C 2,
the inclusion of the potentiometer is an
advantage as a means of readily adjusting
the voltage to the screen-grid at a suit-
able working value. In Fig. 2 the poten-
tiometer is the sole regeneration control,
and the immediate advantage of this
method is that there is very little de-
tuning of the signal, even at high fre-
quencies, if the detector is operating at
its correct potentials. The writer uses
this method with a 77 valve in a receiver
big. 2.-The R.F. pentode used as electron-coupled regene-
rative detector, with choke coupling. The type 78 can be
used in place of the 77.
for 10-metre amateur communication,
ed even at seven metres regeneration
is remarkably smooth and free from ex-
cessive detuning. The circuit of Fig. 2
outlines a receiver using heater-type
valves, but as the valves are of the 6.3-
volt type the supply may be either A.C.
or D.C. If A.C., the centre-tapped heater
resistor is advisable, but if batteries are
used this should be omitted and B nega-
tive connected to
A negative.
There is a fea-
ture of Fig. 1
which demands
attention. Note
that a three-point
filament switch is
provided to pre-
vent the screen-
grid potentio-
meter from run-
ning the B bat-
tery down when
the set is switched
off, as it would do
if the usual two-
point switch were
used. Such three-
point switches can
be obtained in
Sydney from Mur-
doch’s, Ltd., and
their inclusion in a receiver with screen-
grid potentiometer fed from B batteries
saves disconnecting the batteries manu-
ally every time the receiver is switched off.

THE VERY FIRST MUSIC WAS PERFECT.
Article I in the Credo of the Greatest
Living Musical Philosopher is that music
always was perfect. In any century, in
any land, there were to hand the means
of complete musical expression, and those
means were used. Music doesn’t im-
prove. You can no more say the music of
the twenty-first century is better than that
of the thirteenth than you can say an
oyster is better than a grape. But,
according to the G.L.M.P., though music
doesn’t improve it develops, and Article
II of his Credo declares that music,
like humanity, is ever striving up-
wards to be free. It has ingrained
democratic tendencies. Schonberg (or
was it Hauer?) threw off the shackles
of keynotes and keys, making every
note in a composition stand free and
equal. Composers such as Fichenscher
and some of the higher-browed jazz sym-
phonists have cast off the fetters of the
interval; Percy Scott has cocked the
snook of derision at regular rhythm, and
quite a squad of young composers is revel-
ling in atonality (which means much the
same in music as amorality does in ethics).
So Western music is becoming freer and
freer, and if it gets liberated very much
more it will have its toe on the threshold
of the music made by naked savages
in jungles, who sing to-day probably (the
savage being a dyed-in-the-wool Con-
servative) exactly the same as their an-
cestors of 6000 years ago did. Innova-
tors who transgress their seven hundred
and sixty-nine tribal laws of harmony and
counterpoint are placed in anthills till
their bones are purged of flesh and their
souls of error.
Admirers of the G.L.M.P., among
whom the writer enthusiastically enrols
himself (whether you go all the way with*
him or not he can emit more new ideas

lifetime), have lately been treated to some
examples of savage music. What I liked
best was a gramophone recording of a
musical soiree on the Island of Bali. Our
cat liked it, too. It had all that deadly
fervor, that surging urgency of expression,
that one associates with the cantatas, and
I’m sure the A.B.C. would have got a
deadly shock if it had understood the
words its powerful electrical machinery
was pushing through the ether.
Now this savage music is perfect (see
Article I). The very first music ever
made is also perfect—the songs of birds
and insects, the chants of chimpanzees,
the serenades of dogs and cats, the deep-
voiced threnodies of cattle and the lilting
lays of sheep and pigs. What I am inter-
ested in is the very first example of human
music consciously produced as such. Did
it come before speech? Almost cer-
tainly it did. It may have been the
mother of speech, though the thought is
a bit staggering to anyone who has
listened to as many political orations as
I have.
Let us try to reconstruct the scene of
the first music. The year is 1,578,432 b.c.
A young lake-dweller of thrifty pro-
pensities has founded a cache of wild
pineapples. Returning from a hunt for
these delicacies he finds the bully of the
tribe wolfing his precious store. Advanc-
ing with catlike grace upon the despoiler
the youngster flings himself upon him
and bites him in the leg. The bully,
taken unawares, emits loud howls,
“Ow! Ow! Ow!” In derisive mimi-
cry the young hero also chants “Ow!
Ow! Ow!” He finds the sound in-
spiring. Clutching the bully’s hair and
tearing out large clumps he chants a loud
“Ow! ” for each clump. Crestfallen (and
darned nigh crestless), the bully slinks
away; the first songster becomes chief
of the tribe, and, leading his warriors
with inspiring cries of “Ow! Ow!” in
every battle, he founds a dynasty as well
as a musical tradition. He had .to wait
for criticism of his art for 1,580,366 years,
when a Great Musical Authority, born
too late to hear him, decided, without
the slightest hesitation, that his music
was perfect. It had to be. It was all
there was.
Profound thought: Can it be that these
chaps who free their music of tone, in-
terval and rhythm want immunity from
criticism under Article I? Our music
is the music of the immediate present.
Therefore you can’t but admit that it
is perfect.

Country Short-wave Explorations.
Several fresh features of interest have
cropped up lately. One certainly gets
full value from a good short-wave set
these days
The German transmission for Aus-
tralia and M.L., as announced, was
commenced with DJN (31.45) and DJB
(19.73) at 7.30 p.m. DJN was excellent
in every way until 9.30, after which signal
strength dropped considerably. By then
DJB was full strength, and continued
so until closing about 10.10 p.m.
Another feature is the reappearance of
Roma Napoli, but on an entirely new
wave-length. The well-known lady an-
nouncer’s voice cannot be mistaken, but
the Italian station rarely uses English,
DX wallpaper! Most amateur transmitters use QSL cards to
decorate the walls of the radio room. This view shows the
Japanese amateur station J2GX, at Tokio. The cards visible show
that the owner has been in communication with many distant
countries, including America, England, Maoriland, Holland,
Belgium, South Africa, Australia, Austria, Egypt, Poland, Russia,
Brazil, France and probably many more.
The wave-length is about 31.21 metres,
and on the two mornings observed it
was easily the best station on the air
between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. If the old
times are observed it will probably be
on the air every day until 8 a.m.
Another station observed for some
time on Sunday mornings in the 25-
metre band, from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m., came
to good strength on a recent Sunday, and
is the Columbia B.C. Co. (U.S.A.). This
is a dual transmission with the one in
the 49-metre band, and is very weak
here. The station is very close to WBXK,
both being on at the same hour.
The 25-metre band is still quiet in
the early morning. FYA has weakened,
if anything, but comes up to fair strength
after 3 p.m.
The broadcast of the royal wedding
was easily followed from GSF and GSE.
The rebroadcast by the local stations was
90 p.c. static in this part of N.S.W. and
quite useless as entertainment or other-
wise.
The 8.8. C. No. 1 transmission con-
tinues to be good, with GSB still the best
and strength holding well until closing
time.
8.8. C. has been experimenting with
aerials. The writer has not had an
opportunity of testing the earlier periods,
but, as far as GSE is concerned, after 12
p.m. the signal strength is so great from
all that it is difficult to detect any dif-
ference.
RNF was again very good at 9 p.m. on
a recent Sunday, but the station’s best
broadcast to date was it's announcement of
the assassination of King Alexander. The
funeral march
played was
one the writer
has not before
heard. It was
most impres-
sive.
All the usual
stations in the
25-, 31- and
19 - m e t r e
bands have
been strong at
night, with
FYA( 19) trans-
mission now
up to the
strength of
summer condi-
tions. Very
little listening
was done
above 31
metres, but
these channels
at present are
not worth at-
tention, the
others having
most to offer.
Several of
the American
amateur ’phone stations were heard on a
recent Sunday afternoon. This is un-
usual at this season. They have also been
heard in the early morning, and should
improve at that time later in the summer.
NIGHTOWL.
Amateur Chatter.
With the passing of the cyclonic weather,
gone are the DX 28mc. contacts. Sun-
day, 9/12/’34, was a disappointing day, in
Sydney anyhow. At 8.45 a.m. the writer
had a brief yarn with VK4XN, of Dalb)
(Q.), heard VK4BB QSO VK2XY, and
spent the day searching a desert-like
silence for Maorilanders. Sydney stations
active were VK’s 2LZ, 2SA, 2YC, 2XY,
2FG and 2NO. VK3BQ and VK3JO were
heard for a fleeting second, and the only
DX of note was the harmonic of JNJ
Tokio, around 2 p.m. Other States may
have had better conditions. So far
VK4BB is well in the lead in points
scored, and looks like holding his posi-
tion against all-comers.
Forty- and 20-metre ’phone exponents
interested only (as so many appear to be)
in “around-the-corner” contacts should
listen to VK2LZ’s 28mc. ’phone, which
reaches over all Sydney day and night.
The ease with which contacts within a
radius of 30 miles or so can be made con-
sistently on 10 metres — minus QRM —
should prompt the attention of local
“ ’phone hounds” for their own sakes. The
poor old 40-metre band is overloaded, and
neither one thing nor the other. DX key-
men rave at the ’phone men, and vice
versa. Why not make use of unoccupied
territory? Any reasonably-designed
receiver will work as efficiently on 10
as on 40 metres. Ten metres would be
an ideal local telephony band, and it
needs only half a dozen consistent sta-
tions there to start a migration. VK2LZ
and VK2NO are planning a duplex chan-
nel, with one station at 28mc. and the
other at 56mc. Some of the Sunday-
evening studio parties would be interest-
ing on 28mc.
Fifty-six megacycles is not to be ne-
glected. A few diehards are planning to
make a bigger and better stir there, and
the subject is much in evidence at all
meetings where amateurs foregather.
There appears to be no reason why the
200 miles or more range of other coun-
tries should not be duplicated. Wanted —
some keen Newcastle (N.S.W.) 5-metre
men to erect reflector systems aimed at
Sydney and to arrange lengthy schedules.
Co-operation in Sydney will be guaran-
teed. Ultra-shorts are infinitely more
interesting than DX a la 40 metres, and
there are thrills awaiting those who will
try hard enough.
A few lines from Australian radio his-
tory, May, 1929 (notes by VK2RX):
“VK3CP’s 10-metre experiments are en-
couraging. He has worked W6BCS and
heard OH2NM, JITX, W6JU, W6XV,
W9EF, W2XBF and NKF from 7 a.rn.
to 1 p.m. He has also worked ZLIFT,
ZLIAO, and ZLIAX many times.”
Something’s happened to DX on 10
metres since those epic days!
VK2NO.
American Police Car Talks with
Sydney by Short-wave Radio.
Australians recently read in the press
that a police car in Schenectady had been
in conversation with VK2ME, Sydney.
A description of this experiment is con-
tained in a letter received from Asso-
ciated General Electric Industries of
Sydney. This says:
The experiment, which utilised the
G.E. radio department’s police test car,
had been vaguely planned prior to its
actual happening, but only the fact that
publicity manager Lang of the G.E.
Co. overslept made him a party to if.
R. E. Farmer, engineer of station
VK2ME, was the party on the other end
of the conversation, and was also sur-
prised at the way things happened. The
sedan used was the experimental model
developed by G.E. for the Boston police
department. Externally the car looks the
same as any other, but inside it has a
French-type telephone hooked on to the
instrument-board. The operating equip-
ment is contained in a trunk at the rear
of the car. With this equipment it is
possible for passengers to converse stead-
ily with headquarters while riding. Two
different frequencies are used, and the
effect is that of a normal telephone con-
Potice-car radio installation in use.
versation, except that it is carried on by
short-wave radio.
Mr. Lang was scheduled to talk to
Australia in the morning from 6.30 to
7.30. This necessitated a rather early
rising, and when the test' car called for
him he had forgotten his appointment
and was delayed in getting ready. To
cut matters short and begin the broad-
cast on time, the engineers at the short-
wave station arranged to make it a
“direct line” from the police car to
Sydney. Mr. Lang’s words were carried
by ultra-short wave below the 10-metre
band to the control board of WGY,
where incoming signals from Australia,
received at the Sacandaga station, were
also being relayed. The incoming and
outgoing signals were so regulated
by the station engineer that the
two-way conversation could begin be-
fore one of the principals had even
arrived at the speaking-point. Station
W2XAF at South Schenactady was used
in sending the signal to Australia. At
this time it was approximately 10 o’clock
at night in Sydney. Neither listeners in
Australia nor short-wave enthusiasts
in America who were listening-m
were aware of what was happening, as
only the usual type of two-way broad-
cast had been scheduled, with some pos-
sibility of working in the police car
afterwards. It was a new thrill for the
amateurs.
1935 British Empire Radio Union
Contest.
Advance information on this important
contest for radio amateurs within the
British Empire is available, by courtesy
of Ray Carter, VK2HC, Yarraman
North, Quirindi (N.S.W.).
Changes have been made in the pro-
cedure, the most important being: (a)
The transmitting contests will take place
on alternative week-ends during Febru-
ary. ( b ) The receiving contest will take
place during the first week-end of each
transmitting contest, (c) Contests will
run from 1700 G.M.T. Saturdays to 1700
G.M.T. Sundays, (d) Power is limited
to 250 watts in the senior. ( e ) One point
will be scored for each contact with a
station in another zone. (/) Thirty prefix
zones are recorded, and all points scored
will be multiplied by the number of
zones worked on 7mc. and 14mc. Re-
cords to date show that no contacts have
been made on 28mc. since the inter-
national contest started. Band-watching
stations are being set up to check the
operation of British stations.
The overseas membership of the Radio
Society of Great Britain has now passed
the 500 mark, the total of all members
being 2220.
Prefixes have been allotted as follows:

New Valve Development.
The filamentless valve has made its
appearance. P. T. Farnsworth, television
engineer of San Francisco, has produced
his electron multiplier tube which may
well be destined to revolutionise valve
technique. This tube has neither filament
nor heater, and the anode is there merely
to keep things going. There are two cath-
odes in the form of flat discs, and the
anode is a ring-shaped electrode between
the two. Around the outside of the
tube is a coil energised by a battery, and
this coil produces a magnetic field within
the tube. A few isolated electrons are
emitted by one of the cathodes by photo-
electric or other means. These electrons
will be attracted to the anode and will
proceed to shoot down the centre of the
tube. When they get near the anode they
are unable to go on, because of the
magnetic field produced by the coil
around the tube. This prevents them

cathode tube.
from turning and keeps them moving in
a straight line. The electrons, therefore,
have to continue down the centre of the
tube, and they carry on until they reach
the other cathode. They strike this with
sufficient force to produce secondary
emission, liberating four or five times as
many electrons. These new electrons
start back down the tube in the opposite
direction, and exactly the same thing
happens. They shoot through the anode
and strike the other cathode, liberating

still more electrons. So the process con-
tinues. The tube actually generates oscil-
lations of rapidly-increasing intensity,
and protective resistances are inserted in
the circuit to prevent the current reach-
ing too high a value.
What’s What in Radio.
According to some people, the radio
home-constructor does not flourish' as in
earlier days. This may be so to some
extent in Australia, but the reverse is
very much the case in England. Evi-
dence is there in the weekly and monthly
radio publications containing information
on how to build this or that creation,
with little or no reference to pro-
grammes. When a leading technical
authority puts his name to a description
of a new kind of receiver there is no
doubt about the thousands of people
who buy the parts and set to work.
John Scott-Taggart, M.C., F.lnst.P.,
A.M.1.E.E., became almost a legendary
figure when he produced his S.T. 100
receiver back in 1922, and now, with his
latest S.T. 600, featured with' magnifi-
cence in “Popular Wireless,” October 27,
1934, his name is on the lips of thousands
of constructors. Scott-Taggart retired,
a young and wealthy man, some years
ago, but he couldn’t keep out of radio
journalism long. He is back, hard at it,
and, as would be said in U.S.A., “And
how !”

Further information from the German
Consul-General for Australia on the
transmissions from the short-wave sta-
tions near Berlin gives the following
times of programmes for Australian lis-
teners: DJB (19.74 m.), 6.45 p.m. to 10.15
p.m., Sydney time; and DIN (31.45 m.),
11 p.m. to 2.30 a.m., Sydney time.

Ultra-short-wave transmitters are now
used extensively in the U.S.A. and other
countries for “running-commentary”
broadcasts, but such equipment is not
confined to broadcasters alone. Ameri-
can newspaper companies have been
quick to take advantage of this radio,
link with special reporters working al *
a scene of action. It is now a familiar
sight to see a newspaper reporter with
a transmitting set strapped to his back.
In a golf contest, for instance, reporters
equipped in this way describe the play
from the greens and bunkers, the signal
being picked up at the clubhouse and
wired to the newsroom.

The General Electric Co. of U.S.A.
has developed a new alloy which can
be welded to glass. It is thus of great
value in radio engineering. This alloy,
called Fernico, opens up possibilities
in the development of various classes of
valves wherein leading-in wires or other
conducting parts must pass through gas-
tight insulating seals. The alloy can be
machined, forged, brazed, soldered,
stamped or welded, and its expansion
curve is conveniently almost the same as
that of certain glasses. Thus a valve
completed with a glass-Fernico seal will
be permanently tight and exceptionally
robust.
Casual Comment.
There is a long-delayed rumpus, now
accelerated by the loss with all hands of
the Coramba, about the fitting of small
coastal vessels with radio. Why there
should ever have been any red-tape or
argument about so vital a subject is be-
yond the comprehension of all reason-
able men. There can be no argument
on the score of technical objections ; they
simply don’t exist. There is no more
difficulty about equipping even a small
motor-launch with a complete low-
powered transmitting and receiving in-
stallation than there is in fitting a motor-
car with a broadcast receiver. If those in
authority need to be shown how to go
about the job, there are approximately
1200 radio amateurs in Australia who
could show them how to instal and
operate low-power emergency apparatus.

The ordinary line filter consisting of
R.F. coils and condensers may be quite
effective in keeping line noises out of a
receiver. With an all-wave receiver, how-
ever, such noises may appear with more
intensity on the shorter-wave ranges of
the tuning. One form of filter developed
overseas takes care of this by using a
resonant circuit tuned to the frequency
of the interference. The circuit of the
arrangement is illustrated, and it will be
seen that the resonant circuit is additional
to the usual form of line filter as indi-
cated by coils LI and condensers Cl.
Condensers C 3 are small trimmer con-
densers of the mica dielectric compression
kind, and the coils L 2 are two honey-
combs from an intermediate-frequency
transformer. The resistor V 1 is a ballast,
and is not essential.

Ultra-shorts proved their utility in con-
trolling the halting of the royal pro-
cession at Sydney’s cenotaph when the
Duke of Gloucester placed a wreath
thereon. Up on Challis House Sergeant
Salmon, chief of the N.S.W. police radio
service, used his five-metre telephony
apparatus to inform the Chief Commis-
sioner’s car exactly what was happening.
The system was duplex, and thus the
starting and stopping of the cars in the
procession were perfectly timed. Salmon
is a keen man at his job, and outside
official hours puts in a lot of his time
making and testing new ultra-short-wave
gear.

From an English radio journal: “We
have published constructional details of
short-wave sets, but have so far not
found a reliable solution to the prob-
lem of designing a superhet to function
on all wave-bands.” Somebody hqs blun-
dered, for the English radio market is
replete with countless valves and com-
ponents suitable for the job. The whole
world to-day is using all-wave superhets,
including England, so what?
Latest in the Trade.
Two publications of interest to short-
wave. listeners and amateurs are now
The radio-aero map of the world with clock-face time indicators.
available in Australia. These are the
Sympal radio-aero map of the world
and the “Australian and New Zealand
Radio Call Book and Time Indicator.”
This book contains a time indicator and
much short-wave information.
The map is particularly useful, and
should make a novel and instructive addi-
tion to the wall of the radio-room.
Lithographed in six colors, it shows, to-
gether with the location of every coun-
try, its international radio and aviation
prefixes. Great circle airline distances
are given, and a most useful feature is
the mechanical time indicator, by which
moving clock dials tell the exact time and
daytime or night-time at any point in the
world without calculation. The differ-
ence occasioned by daylight-saving
changes in time, as adopted in many
countries, is determinable by reference
to a chart. The call-book is very com-
prehensive, and contains a time indica-
tor, station log, frequency-conversion
chart, list of Australian, M.L., U.S.A. and
world short-wave and broadcasting sta-
tions, calibration chart, international pre-
fixes by countries, press, weather and
time reports, instructions on receiver
operation, list of Australian and M.L.
amateur transmitters, and other features.
Both map and call-book are obtain-
able from the N.S.W. Bookstall Co.,
Sydney, or The Bulletin office, the
prices being 6s. 6d. (postage 3d.) and 2s.
6d. (postage 2d.) respectively.

As outlined in the article on radio-
inductive interference (B. 28/11 /’34), the
logical way of dealing with such inter-
ference is to kill it at the source where-
ever possible. This is easily done in the
case of 'most electrical appliances, in-
cluding motors, by using a twin-con-
denser by-pass to earth. To meet the
steadily increasing demand for such sup-
pressors Ducon Condenser Pty., Sydney,
has now produced four types of Chanex
interference-suppressor units, two of
which are illustrated. They are of the
paper dielectric type, wax impregnated,
and comprise two units of similar capa-
city, series-connected and centre-tapped,
and with an internal fuse. The types are
2 x .5 mfd., 2xl mfd., 2x2 mfd. and
2x4 mfd., listed at 7s. 6d., 9s. 6d., 14s.
6d. and 255. 6d. respectively. Each unit
is housed in a conveniently sized steel
case, with capacity and connection code
marked clearly, and two projecting lugs
are provided for mounting. Ducon Con-
denser Pty, Ltd., 73 Bourke-street, Water-
loo, is in full production on these
suppression units, and would be pleased
to hear from readers’ and listeners’
leagues in districts where such' inter-
ference is rife, with the object of co-
operation wherever possible.

Experimenters interested in ultra-high-
frequency work in Australia now have
some useful valves available for the pur-
pose. Stocks of the R.C.A. type 801 are
carried by A.W.A. Valve Co., Ltd., Syd-
ney. The 801, like the 800, may be
operated with' maximum rated input at
60 megacycles, and with reduced input
at . 150 megacycles. This valve will sup-
ply considerably more output at 5 and
24 metres than any of the receiving types
often used for transmitters.

Expert’s Views on Iron-cored Coils.
F. H. Haynes, a radio engineer of
pioneer standing, for many years tech-
nical editor of “Wireless World” (Eng-
land) and now a manufacturer, is one of
those who consider the modern tuned
R.F. receiver can, in certain circum-
stances, be preferable to the superhetero-
dyne. He writes:
To-day the position of the straight R.F.
amplifier is quite different. The Ferrocart
tuning coils, even in a circuit arranged for
high selectivity, produce very considerable stage
gain, and this can be used to full advantage
owing to the remarkably low grid-to-anode
capacity of the type of R.F. valve now avail-
able. The R.F. pentode, as compared with
the screen-grid valve, does not introduce effects
of cross-modulation. The variable-Mu type
handles a considerable signal input without dis-
tortion by change of modulation, and with
the aid of amplified A.V.C. can be arranged
automatically to adjust the signal-handling
properties so as to be always in a condition
of accepting, without distortion, a signal input
in excess of that by which it is actuated.
The characteristic of a tuned circuit having
Ferrocart coils is such that sensitivity is almost
uniform across the tuning range. High selec-
tivity is obtained without side-band cutting,
due mainly to filter design and partly to the
important fact that amplified A.V.C. renders
the receiver insensitive to a slightly off-tune
interfering signal.
Scott-Taggart, English radio author-
ity, in introducing his S.T. 600 receiver
for home-constructors observes: “In
serving the constructor alone in produc-
ing a great nationally-built set, the journal
benefits and the radio industry benefits
enormously ; £500,000 is going to be spent
on the S.T. 600, most of which will go,
incidentally, into the pay-envelopes of
employees. When you build the S.T. 600
you will be turning lathes, stoking factory
fires and starting transport.” Rather
different from Australia, where home-
construction is encouraged by only one

My King Neutrodyne, using A.C. valves, has
developed a buzzing sound when the dial is
tuned to any station from 320 metres down.
Valves are 226 ’s in first, second and third R.F.
stages, 227 detector and 226 first audio. (1)
Cause of trouble ? (2) What type of speaker
is suitable ? (3) Are there any improvements
in the types of valves used ? (4) What receiver
do you recommend as substitute ? —192.
(1) The R.F. stages may need reneutralising,
or valves may be faulty. Audio instability
could also be responsible, or the detector grid
leak and condenser may be faulty. (2) De-
pends on the output -valve. This is not stated.
(3) Not in the 226, which is almost obsolete.
The 227 has been replaced by the 56. (4)
Any modern receiver made by a reputable con-
cern.
I wish to build the Wide-World Four (B.
18/7/’34). Please advise if the following parts
are suitable: Two 2\in. formers from a Cossor
1925 screen-grid three, two, Ormonde .0005 mfd.
variable condensers, two Cossor slow-motion
dials, one Ferranti AFSCC transformer and a
Magnavox dynamic speaker? —l93.
The coil formers are on the large size, and
this would necessitate very careful screening
of the tuned R.F. stage, but they could be
used. Cannot give coil windings, as you do
not say whether broadcast or short-wave
coverage is wanted. If short-wave, cut the vari-
able condensers down to four moving and
three fixed plates each; if broadcast, use
as they are. The dials will be suitable, but
unless you wish to use push-pull instead of
Class-B audio the AFSCC will not be suit-
able. If the speaker is a permanent magnet
type it is suitable.
Method of charging my 2-volt 120 -amp.
accumulator by attaching to the dash of my
car ? Is any method practicable and advis-
able ? —195.
Calls for complication and switching in the
generator circuit, and is not advisable.
Have an old Ford coil, some audio trans-
formers and a shocking coil, and wish to build
a power-supply for a monitor, running from
a 6-volt accumulator. Can this be done ? —194.
Yes. The secondary output of the Ford
coil can be used for high voltage and rectified
by a valve, such as a 201 A with grid and plate
connected, or a 8406. This rectifier valve must
have its own separate filament supply. The
audio transformers can be used as filter chokes,
and the usual filter condensers will be needed.
The same 6-volt accumulator can be used to
heat the monitor valve.
We have been hearing a station broadcast-
ing news and advertisements in French, mostly
with dance music and records, at 4.45 a.m.
The wave-length is approximately half a degree
below 4QG. The callsign has not yet been
identified. Who could this be ? —193.
According to the official lists, this station
could be Toulouse, P.T.T. France, listed as
386.6 metres, power 2 kilowatts.

What About the Public?
“Cosmos”: One of the interested parties
who are battling for film quotas (a dis-
tributor’s as well as an exhibitor’s quota)
or N. S. Wales asserts that “everyhlm-
producing country in the world, except
Australia!” had established its movie
trade by means of quotas. The fact is
no country has
France’s experience is typical. In 1928
when the French decided to found a
movie industry with a drastic quota for
“first category” films (i.e., films written
and directed by Frenchmen, photo-
graphed entirely in French territory,
acted by French casts and paid for with
French capital) 581 feature films were
shown in France. Of these 368 were
American, 91 German and only 74
French. (The others were Russian,
Italian, British, etc.) That had been
about the proportion in previous years
(444 American to 55 French in 1926;
577 American to 73 French in 1925 ; 589
American to 68 French in 1924 ; and so
on), and it is about the proportion now.
Arty journalists in England and the
U.S.A. have commended the originality
and Gallic wit of some French films that
have appeared since the quota law was
passed; but audiences won’t pay to see
them outside France, and they make no
money to speak of in France.
Ufa got a tremendous boost in Eng-
land when the patriotic drive against
Hollywood began seven years ago, and
the rigid German quota was expected to
complete the good work. Then the world
learned that Hollywood had bought
Ufa out. Under the quota system,
according to a speech made recently by
General Goring, “the German cinema
has sunk to a level which cannot be men-
tioned in a discussion of art.”
Britain has done best of the quota
nations, but the chief reason is that
most of its really successful films have
been American. American in inspira-
tion ; American in technical and other
innovations; partially American often as
regards their casts ; and sometimes, like
“Cavalcade,” American in origin.
If Australians have the capacity to
make films that the world wants to see
they will do it, as Hollywood did, with-
out quotas. If they have no such gift,
then the quota system will deprive Aus-
tralia’s film-going public of the first-rate
international movjes which they are now
able to see in favor of productions like
“The Hayseeds” and “Strike Me Lucky!”

try. And it won’t be fair to the public,

“Treasure Island”
The carper can easily identify minor
weaknesses in M.-G.-M.’s film of Steven-
son’s classic at Sydney St. James. The
medley of English and American accents.
The operatically unreal behavior of the
yokels at the inn. The natty clothes and
youthful beauty of Otto Kruger as Dr.
Livesey.
Nevertheless, it is an enthralling movie,
in which much of the fantasy and terror
of the book has been captured. A matter
largely of the cast. As Jim Hawkins
Jackie Cooper registers every childish
emotion, and he rarely strikes a false
note. Wallace Beery (Long John Silver)
provides a most consistent study of one
of those genial morons who are the
despair of penologists. Possessed of all
the social virtues except a conscience,
they usually gravitate to a corfdemned
cell, go unconcernedly to the gallows
after a hearty breakfast, and die honestly
regretted by their gaolers and counsel.
Long John is the associate hero of the
film ; you are delighted to see him escape,
loaded to the gunwale with stolen doub-
loons, in the last sequence. Most of the
other buccaneers, barring one whose
name doesn’t appear on the programme,
are so robustious that they might be fol-
lowers of Captain Hook. Particularly
Lionel Barrymore as Bones. The ex-
ception plays a guitar and sings “Gather
Ye Rosebuds,” and is a most satisfying
ruffian of the oily type. “Chic” Sales
seems to have put as much thought and
intelligence into his part as Beery ; his
Ben Gunn is a glorious fantastic.
The island sets are mpre Hollywoodish
than the others; in one of them Jim is
understandably surprised to encounter an
ostrich. The Hispaniola—specially built
for the occasion—is a triumph, and
the quayside shots are beautiful. No
lover of the best pirate yarn in the lan-
guage should miss this version of it.
“My Song for You”
This one doesn’t justify the producer’s
claim that it is Jan Kiepura’s greatest
picture. It ranks, in fact, a bad third to
his two previous films. Kiepura’s voice
is less pleasing, and his attempts at
comedy are melancholy. Not so those
of Sonnie Hale, who, as the singer’s
manager, makes the picture almost worth
while. All the old formulas have been

Cristo,” at Sydney State.
followed, even down to the bride’s chang-
ing her mind at the altar and rushing off
into the arms of the hero.
Aileen Marson is the bride ; she de-
serves a better fate. The Embassy.
“Girls Will Be Boys”
Cyril Maude, a misogynist living in
his ducal mansion, where even the laun-
dresses and housemaids (if they may be
so called) are men, has thrust upon him
a grandson of whose existence he was
unaware.
The lad appears to be a milksop, so
the duke’s ward (Esmond Knight) is com-
missioned to make a man of him. The
task is difficult, the seeming grandson
being a girl. Dolly Haas brings out the
humor of her dual role, though her male
disguise would deceive no one but an
astigmatic.
Edward Chapman is funny as the
duke’s harassed secretary. Also at the
Embassy.

Lineal successor to “Lilac Time” and
“Blossom Time,” and, one may hope, a
last attempt to capitalise Vienna by pro-
Henry Wilcoxon in “Cleopatra," at

viding Franz Schubert with a high-flown
romance. Nils Asther, made up to re-
semble Beethoven, is the composer. He
has been dismissed from the Esterhazy
household for making love to the daugh-
ter (she was 12 at the time!), and he tear-
fully complains to Pat Paterson, his new
flame, that when he sang his famous
serenade under the maiden’s window she
rewarded him with a “gold coin.” As
Count Esterhazy paid Franz only £2 a
v/eek this windfall would probably have
delighted him. In any case he wasn’t
dismissed. All we know about his love-
time in the Esterhazy menage is in a
letter: “The housemaid is very pretty
and often pays me a visit; the butler is
my rival.”
Schubert’s adventures, as recounted
here, include a command concert before
the Austrian Emperor at which the first
item is an orchestral performance of the
familiar “Marche Militaire.” (Schubert
never gave a concert at Court, and the
march was written for pianoforte duet.)
Schubert is made to tell Miss Paterson
that he wrote the “Standchen” (used a$
the principal musical motif of the film)
for the violin, whereas it was written as
a song. The rest of the fantasia doesn’t
even pretend to be anything but fiction.
A Schubert romance, to carry any
degree of conviction, ought to be more
after the pattern of “La Boheme” than
“The Prisoner of Zenda,” but that would
shut out the palace scenes and musi-
comedy uniforms by which Hollywood
identifies Vienna. At Sydney Capitol.
“Thank Your Stars”
Also at the Capitol. Protagonists, a
semi-idiotic sideshow spruiker (Jack
Oakie), a pole-sitting champion (Roscoe
Karns), a crooner (Dorothy Dell) and a
jazz orchestra (Ben Bernie and band).
Some of these folk seem to have been
successful in radio, and they reproduce
their specialties. It’s the old, old story
of the vaudeville songster and wise-
cracker who didn’t realise that the goil
was the breadwinner of the team, lost
her, and regained her just before the
fade-out. A dead loss of 7150 feet of
good celluloid.
“I’ll Fix It”
A Jack Holt at the Civic. Holt is a
political boss this time, and Mona Barrie
is a pretty little school-teacher. Holt wants
to “fix it” with her for his young brother
to play in a baseball team contrary to
school regulations. She refuses, he has
her sacked, and with the aid of an em-
bittered newspaper editor she starts a
civic inquiry that threatens to ruin him.
He admits the error of his ways, she
saves him and the fade-out comes with
the pair in a taxi. Commonplace stuff,
of course, but it’s splendidly handled.
“Cash”
An English imitation of a familiar
brand of Hollywood comedy. Edmund
Gwenn is a businessman with a pretty
daughter, an excellent butler and a fine
house, but only about 2/1 in hard coin.
Robert Donat comes to the house to cut
off the electricity and finds that a thief
has stuffed 100,000 dollars into his bag.
The mere sight of the money inspires
Gwenn to found a new company and
make all their fortunes. It’s a pity
Americans were not given the chance
to do it.
“La Cucaracha”
This support to “Monte Cristo” (re-
viewed in The Bulletin last week) is a
songandance film in technicolor based
on the Mexican song. As an example
of color photography it is ahead of
anything yet shown in Australia. At
Sydney State.
Some First Nights
Jean Bart’s “The Squall,” presented by
G. Gordon Forsythe at the Sydney Cri-
terion last Saturday, is a cleverly con-
structed play that deserves more than the
one week’s run it has been allotted. The
action is laid in a Spanish farmhouse.
Jose and Dolores Mendez are celebrat-
ing the, anniversary of their wedding
and th& betrothal of their son Juan and
pretty Anita. In the midst of the festivi-
ties are heard shouts for assistance. The
door is opened to admit Nubi, a gipsy
girl fleeing from the wrath of the fero-
cious leader of her tribe. She is hidden
by the revellers, and her pursuer is got
out of the way by the village priest.
The girl remains in the farmhouse
as a servant. A tempestuous and
seductive wench, she soon has the men-
folk of the house off their balance. Pedro,
a manservant, completely loses his head,
attempts to force his affections upon her
and is dismissed. His sweetheart,
Manuela, stalks distractedly about in the
background. Juan forsakes his gentle
bride-to-be, neglects his studies and
steals Manuela’s life-savings—all for the
feckless Nubi. Papa Jose finds the gipsy’s
embraces to his liking. Through all the
turmoil and intrigues Dolores remains
steadfast, endeavoring to smooth things
over, and only breaks down when she
realises that Jose has been unfaithful.
Everybody is ripe for murder when in
stalks the gipsy chief—a tremendous,
awe-inspiring fellow—picks up the ter-
rified and squealing Nubi and carries
her away. The unexpected abduction
snaps the tension, and all’s well at the
curtain. The players were mostly ama-
teurs. Eriid Lorimer, as Dolores, was
the outstanding figure. She invested the
part with a quiet nobility and sympathy,
and left little room for complaint.
Spencer Teakle was effective as the son,
and May. Baker, as Manuela, was also
among the first-raters. As Nubi, Daphne
Winslow , was inclined to overact. She
was spirited enough when the lines called
for a show of fire, but lacked the smooth-
ness and artistry of the accomplished
vamp. Hay Simpson was thoroughly at
home as the terrible El Moro, the gipsy
chief.

Doris Fitton’s Independent Players jus-
tified their existence by performing “Peter
Pan” at Sydney Savoy in a manner that
gave a juvenile audience complete satis-
faction. It wasn’t an easy task, as many
of the youngsters seemed to be very
familiar with Barrie’s fantasy. One of
them afterwards declared that there
“wasn’t a word left out.” Anne Gordon
was Peter, Marguerite Cullen-Ward was
Wendy, and both were excellent. Cap-
tain Hook and the Darling family were
also worthily represented.

In his broadcast lecture-recital on Sun-
day night Percy Grainger, speaking on
the sublime and trivial elements in music,
said he had examined all the slow move-
ments of Beethoven’s sonatas, sym-
phonies and other long compositions, and,
with the single exception of the first
movement of the “Moonlight,” he found
that, though the theme often was noble
and beautiful, the development degene-
rated sooner or later into trivial passage-
playing and vain repetitions. It would
be a great loss to music if the works of
Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, Schumann
and Weber were no longer studied, but
their finest compositions were so long and
occupied so much time in performance
that there was a danger of their ousting
from consideration the dozens of later
composers who had something new and
interesting to say and could say it much
more briefly. The only extensive Beet-
hoven excerpt illustrating this lecture was
the slow movement from the “Appassio-
nata” —gramophone record by Harold
Bauer!

The audience at Melbourne Garrick
on Saturday could hear the engine of
Eugene O’Neill’s brain creaking because
he declined to change gears on a steep
dramatic hill.
“Days Without End,” like most of
his latest plays, turns on one man, and
that man a person who should have been
an inmate of a psychopathic home long
before the rising of the curtain. He is a
searcher for truth, and his search leads
him into strange situations, the turning
point being that he loves his wife so
deeply that he hates her and has an
utterly unsatisfactory affair with another
woman which so afflicts his conscience
that he desires to kill his wife —why,
O’Neill only knows. All ends happily.
The bold bid which O’Neill has
made to be original this time is to
have the hero’s other self—a gentleman
invisible to the other characters, but
made up like our old friend The Face
at the Window—dog him throughout the
Elissa Landi in “The Count of Monte
Cristo.”
action of the piece. Sometimes this weird
spirit seems to be his conscience ; some-
times his evil genius. He chips in on
every subject, until, finally, when the
hero finds religion, he collapses in a heap.
The fact of the play having been
received seriously at all is a tribute
to the acting of the Gregan McMahon
Players. One slip would have tipped the
whole thing into farce. Lloyd Lamble
succeeded in making the hero appear
human, if insane. Paul O’Loughlin was
impressive as the evil genius and steered
clear of bathos, a difficult feat in the
circumstances. G. H. Crosby gave a
capital picture of the old priest, uncle of
the hero, who struggles to bring him back
to the fold. Lynette Dickenson acted
naturally as the wife, and Eve Wynne
played the experimenter with elan.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Candidates well in the market for the
Villiers Stakes and' the Summer Cup
sported silk at Rosehill. There was brisk
betting on the Dundas Handicap, and it
furnished an excellent race. Australia
Fair was favorite, backed to 9 to 4 after
fours had been laid ; Turbine was at 4 to
1, Closing Time at 9 to 2, and Roman
Spear had support at eights. Wexford
essayed to lead all the way, but Aus-
tralia Fair was going easily behind him at
the turn, and when the favorite took
charge at the Leger it seemed all over.
But Roman Spear and Bill Wedgewood
threw out challenges, Australia Fair
weakened, and the mare beat the little
stallion by half a head, with the tiring
Australia Fair nearly a length away.
Turbine, Whittingham and Closing Time,
almost together, were at his heels.
In appearance there is nothing striking
about Miss Nottava, but she can go fast
and stay. Four to one for the Decem-
ber Handicap, she had Pratt in the
saddle ; he is riding in great form. He
allowed the mare to lob along behind
Satmoth (3 to 1) and Dark Chief to the
turn, and when Satmoth had had enough
she came along and downed Dark Chief
comfortably, Tremayne being third—he
just beat Master Brierly for the placing.
Master Brierly was a conspicuous last
most of the way. He drops three
pounds in the Summer Cup, and the addi-
tional three furlongs will suit him.
Mainlaw (7 to 4) is said to be a rod
in pickle for the Villiers, but he was
lucky to get a dead-heat for first with the
Queenslander Bachian (10 to 1) in the
Carlingford Mile. Bachian made all the
running, and had to beat off opponent
after opponent before he was challenged
by Mainlaw. Mainlaw got his head in
front, but Bachian hung on surprisingly
well, and at the finish the Queensland
horse—he is now trained at Randwick
u y +* Pe !u r Lawson--'was doing slightly
better than the favorite. Archmel, who
nad to be eased at one stage to avoid a
collision, ran fourth, with After Money,
badly away, in fifth position. She may be
worth following.
A.J.C. committeeman E. J. Watt was
present to take charge of the Corinthian
Cup won for him by Dromos (3 to 1)
h e had previously scored with Celtic.
Amateur jockey R. Carter, of Barraba,
rode an excellent race on the winner.
Sky Brightener, who had the services of
L. J. Gleeson, of Wingham, was second ;
the favorite, Tatyoon, ridden by A. Camp-
bell, of Coonamble, was third. Tatyoon
lost ground at the barrier, but it was not
the rider’s fault.
R. J. Allwood, a Cairns sportsman, has
a smart galloper in the Highfield colt
Ben Field. Starting at sevens, with O.
Thorley atop, Ben Field beat his oppo-
nents badly in the Nursery Handicap.
Loud Applause followed the runaway,
with Cablegram a poor third and Hero-
ina fourth. It was Ben Field’s first race.
Frassadale (5 to 1) defeated Adye by
half a head in the Novice. Positions
would have been reversed if Adye’s
apprentice jockey hadn’t eased his mount
when she ran to the front at the Leger.
Bob Abbott, a veteran jockey, was given
a fine reception on the winner, who has
proved a bargain for G. W. Foster —
Foster races him on lease.

At Ascot (Vic.) on Saturday two can-
didates from the Pytchley Lodge stable
of James Scobie caught the judge’s eye.
Pytchley Lodge is separated from the
racecourse by only the width of Ascot
Vale-road. Gilt and Petau were making
a beeline for their mangers, as it were,
when they won the Glenroy Handicap
and Ascot Thousand respectively. Both
thoroughbreds were bred at Melton by
E. E. D. Clarke, who races them. Gilt
registered his maiden victory among the
juveniles, but Petau is a seasoned five-
year-old.
In the spring of 1933 Petau landed the
V.R.C. Stand Handicap, an event which
often throws strong light on Cup pros-
pects. That season he did not train on
so well as was expected, but now he
seems to be attaining solidity. The natty
little stallion caused a mild sensation
during the centenary round by annex-
ing the Ascot Cup at 33 to 1. On Satur-
day he firmed to 10 to 1, after longer
odds had been laid. First money in the
Ascot Cup was £4OO, and in the Ascot
Thousand £7OO ; so that Petau has de-
veloped into somewhat of a money-
spinner.
Sol Green supplied the favorite for
the Ascot Thousand in Worthing, a colt
by Verbius (imp.) from Barryanda, by
Martian. On Oaks Day Worthing beat
Gavin Girl and the even-money favorite
Barak in the V.R.C. Maiden Plate ; at
his next start the colt ran third to Gothic
Gem and lolaus in the Williamstown
Cup. After being one of the leaders at
the turn out of the straight on Saturday
he did not travel at all generously along
the back stretch, and could not finish
nearer than fifth. Last when he passed
the judge’s box for the first time, Petau
made a brilliant run from the half-mile,
and had the race in his keeping at the
straight, winning by a length from the
Westralian-bred Isle of Astur, with Sadie
Glass a close third.
Petau is by Cyklon (sire of Trivalve)
from Begonia, by The Welkin from Cel-
osia. In her last three seasons Begonia
has been mated with Gilt Edge ; so far
Gilt Edge has not done much good at
the stud, but Gilt is rather a promising
colt. Odds of 50 to 1 went begging
about Gilt, and McShortodds was glee-
ful when the chestnut shot past Wormana
at the distance, to score by half a length.
Gilt was in receipt of nearly 3st. from
Wormana, who, though slightly built,
handled 9st. 71b. with rare courage over
the uphill straight.
Tasmanian hopgrower and Richmond
brewer P. G. Hay has a stud at Flinders
Island, where Fourth Hand, the stallion
imported from England by Lord Somers,
is lord of the harem. Hay patronised
outside stallions before he acquired
Fourth Hand, and the mating of Mestiza
(All Black —Sainte Devote) with Verbius
produced Gavin Girl. She carried her
breeder’s colors to victory in the Ascot
Five Hundred. Tom Woodcock, who
took Phar Lap to America, trains Gavin
Girl on the delicensed Sandown Park
course, which his employer holds on
lease. Hay’s pleasure over the success of
Gavin Girl was dampened by the earlier
defeat of Last Rub in the Kensington
Handicap, for three-year-olds. In private
trials Gavin Girl had been consistently
beaten by Last Rub, and the latter was
served up a hot favorite, only to finish
among the also-rans. Pu-Yi, who cap-
tured this event, is the first galloping
winner turned out by D. Walsh. This
young man was a leading reinsman at
the trotting fixtures before he took out
a V.R.C. license as owner-trainer.
Events for ponies have disappeared
from Ascot programmes. Stake-money
on Saturday amounted to £2650. Unless
the A.J.C. intervenes it will be genera-
tions before former Sydney pony clubs
offer that amount in one day.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Sonnenberg has gone back to the
U.S.A. with the blot of a defeat on his
’scutcheon. He was beaten by Lurich
at Sydney Stadium on Thursday after
five dreary rounds. There was no bet-
ting on the act or exhibition or whatever
it was, and only hoots were heard when
Lurich’s body-scissors scored for that
well-nourished and very fortunate immi-
grant in the second “round.” Sonnen-
berg’s turn came in the fourth: flying
tackles and a body-press put Lurich
down for the required three seconds. But
in the fifth Sonnenberg dived through
the ropes, and was unable or unwilling
to regain the ring before 10 seconds had
been counted. Then the crowd hooted
its way out of the building. The whole
thing was very raw, but perhaps people
who encourage these buffoons and line
their pockets with easy money deserve
no better.

ms and Outs
Queensland flopped badly in the Shield
game against Victoria in Melbourne. Bat-
ting first, the Victorians made 374 (Rigg
87, Oakley 44, McCormick 77 n.o. and
Fleetwood-Smith 63); the two bowlers
added 98 for the last wicket. Oxenham
took 4 for 135. Ebeling, who captained
the Vic. team, and Fleetwood-Smith had
a field day on Saturday, dismissing
Queensland for 155 ; Ebeling 4-33, F.-
Smith 5-57. Left-hander Hansen (56
n. 0.) had poor support. Victoria, by an

In Adelaide, N. S. Wales put up 400
against South Aus. (Fingleton 55, Brown
81, Kippax 139 and Hill 30). Grimmett,
bowling most of the time with a ban-
daged hand, got 4 for 140. Badcock (15)
went early, stumped by Oldfield off
Chilvers, the same as in Sydney, and he’ll
evidently have to learn how to deal with
the slow stuff. Eight were down for 187
(Richardson 57 and Lonergan 40), and
it looked as though the side would have
to follow-on; but Grimmett (35) and
Edwards (22 n. 0.) added 43 for the ninth
wicket, and when Wall went it was 249
Chilvers’s 5-58 was the best bowling
effort; Robinson, playing his first Shield
game, took 2 for 42.

“S. Gumm”: “Name the best all-
rounder that ever played cricket in Aus-
tralia.” A group of old-timers essayed
the task in Sydney the other day The
merits of Giffen, Noble, Armstrong and
Jack Gregory were discussed, and, among
the English, those of Lohmann and Ham-
mond. While each had a supporter, none
could get more than one vote. Pres-
ently a South Australian chipped in to
the effect that, while he had nothing to
urge against any of the players men-
tioned, his State had had a man who out-
topped them all. “Don’t laugh,” he said ;
“it] s Jack Crawford. That’s only my
opinion, I suppose.” “It’s mine, too,”
interposed a former star of the N.S.W.
Eleven; and it’s mine, for what my
opinion is worth. Englishmen will tell
you that, as a schoolboy cricketer
(he was at Repton), Crawford has
never been approached. He had a genius
for the game in all its departments and
every physical qualification, except that
he had to wear specs. He took such a
hilarious view of life that, for Surrey and
for South Australia, he was seldom in
good shape ; but when he condescended
to be serious he was unsurpassed with
bat, ball and in the field.

After all, there was no Perry-Craw-
ford meeting in the Vic. champion
singles. Kooyong was ready for the semi-
finals, and there Quist gave Perry the
biggest drubbing of his career —6-0, 6-2,
6-0. As was here suggested before he
arrived, the English champion has gone
dead stale. Crawford had an easy win
from De Stefani; he took the first two sets,
6-1, 6-1, and then slowed down, finish-
ing it in the fourth. Hughes and Mal-
colm (from South Africa) and young
Bromwich went earlier; Bromwich to
Turnbull.
Dorothy Round got through to the
final of the women’s event easily enough ;
but Joan Hartigan had a couple of hard
matches, one against Mrs. Hopman, 6-8,
6-1, 7-5. In the final the Sydney girl
made a good fight in the first set, which
went to 9-7, but Miss Round did not let
her win a game in the other. With Mrs.
Harper as a partner, Miss Round was,
however, defeated by her travelling com-
panions, Misses Lyle and Dearman, in
the ladies’ doubles. If there was any
danger of Quist’s head bursting as a
result of his victory over Perry, Craw-
ford averted it by proving the Adelaide
lad’s master, 6-2, 8-6, 6-3. Bromwich
and Miss Wynne (Vic.) were the most
successful juniors; each triumphed in
both singles and doubles.

In Brisbane McGrath and Moon beat
Brugnon and Boussus, ten sets to nine.
Boussus won both his singles, in straight'
sets against McGrath and with the loss

Grath. Each team won one of the doubles

Under the Whip
Not often in recent years have Mel-
bourne racegoers witnessed the spectacle
of two horses carrying the same colors
battling out the finish ; but it happened
at Caulfield last Thursday. The race was
the Alfred Handicap ; the owner is W.
R. Kemball; the neddies —both from
Maoriland —are Palm Queen and Queen
Helen. Each was backed a bit: Palm
Queen at 8 to 1, Queen Helen at tens.
Palm Queen, a four-year-old (Queen
Helen is a year younger), is by Limond —
Rose Queen, and was second in the
Maoriland St. Leger. In other days that
would have been enough to induce some
Sydney man to offer four figures for her.
* * * *
English-bred sires imported to South
Aus. have been noticeably long-lived
and prolific. Pistol was a case in point;
now St. Anton has followed him to the
happy grazing grounds. A four-year-
old when bought by the Aldridges, of
Richmond Park stud, he sired 660 win-
ners of 1450 races and died at 26. His
progeny—sprinters rather than stayers —
distinguished themselves in every State,
and the stake-money their owners col-
lected is reckoned at a quarter of a mil-
lion—a few pounds more or less don’t
matter.
* * * *
“Din”: That saint' in Islam the Aga
Khan has headed the list of winning
owners in Britain for the fourth time in
six years. His bag for the season just
ended was a few pounds short of £65,000,
and he still has plenty of time ahead of
him to better the
record for the Brit-
ish turf—the Duke
of Portland’s £73,900
in 1889. To date
the Aga has won
£434,000 in Britain
since he first
weighed-in in 1922,
and his successes on
French courses have
been equally mark-
ed. He is a fearless
buyer of promising
youngsters, no price
being too high for
anything he fancies.
As his followers of the Ismaili sect
are said to contribute something like
a million annually in tithes to their head,
he shoulid be able to afford it.
Ins and Outs
“Bramall Lane”: Though cricket runs
in families —the Graces, Studds, Steels
and Lyttletons are English instances,
while the Gregorys, Trotts and McLeods
have carried on the tradition at this end
—there are few instances of ability for
the game descending in the direct line
from father to son. Young Victor
Trumper, just promoted to first-grade
cricket in Sydney, is a case in point. As
a batsman he shows no sign of following
in his father’s tracks. As a bowler, good
judges think he has a future. It is worth
recalling that in his early days, at least,
Victor, senior, could bowl decent stuff,
and was fond of trying it.
sf. H= H= *
“Eitzcray”: On their way to Mel-
bourne the N.S.W. cricketers played a
match at Benalla, where they encoun-
tered 'a bowler who made them wonder
if that last drink was really advisable.
A youngster named Maynard, he bowls
right hand but delivers the ball over his
left shoulder from behind his head. He
is usually well on the wicket, with plenty
of overspin, though he gat only one
wicket on this occasion. It is to be
hoped the tourists arranged for the freak
trundler’s action to be filmed. A view
of it in slow motion should be instruc-
tive.
“Maths.”: Figures can’t lie, but some
of the folk who dabble in them get
mighty near it sometimes. Two of the
world’s experts in cricket statistics have
clashed over their respective records of
score totals compiled by Australian
batsmen. The discrepancies in the two
lists amount to several hundreds of runs
in some cases; Bardsley, for instance,
tops one and is only third in the other.
These inaccuracies are excusable in
minor computations such as the adjust-
ment of the basic wage to the cost of
living, and so on. Matters of grave
international import like cricket scores
and averages are on a different footing,
and legislation, or at least a Royal Com-
mission, seems to be called for.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: The complaints by English
professional cricketers of the beggarly pay
allowed them for Test matches in Eng-
land have softened the heart of the Board
of Control at that end. In addition to
the £5O gross, out of which they had to
pay for their own accommodation while
losing a couple of county matches at
£lO each, Test players are to get an extra
£lO a match, plus a bonus for the same
amount. This means that a man who
played in all five Tests against Wood-
full’s men last season will pouch £lOO
“Wot’s up, Joe?”
“Blasted fool used a piece of the wife’s Christmas puddin instead of a. sinker !”
more than he anticipated. The counties
also benefited, the divvy for each being
about £l5O0 —money from heaven for
most of them.

The Nineteenth Hole
“No. 7”: A parting comment of the
American P.G.A. team, whose members,
together with Thomson, hero of the
centenary open, left Sydney on the Mon-
terey, was that the Australians failed
“almost entirely owing to their lack of
hard, incessant golf.” The game, like
many others, has reached a paradoxical
stage. The front-rankers, amateur as well
as professional, devote as much time to
it as a stage conjurer does to his art,
and they are able consequently to per-
form amazing feats. Any natural player
who concentrated on the game to the
exclusion of practically all else might
have reasonable hopes of breaking 70 on
most courses ; but only while he went
on concentrating. To let up for a month
or so would put him back in the rabbit
(or near-rabbit) class. It suggests that
Australia will never become a golfing
nation. There isn’t enough money in
exhibition golf for pros, to abandon
club-selling for practice, and we have
no leisured class to supply amateurs
capable of working at golf like pros.
* * * *
“Corso”: Ezar and Kirkwood played
an exhibition game against the amateurs
Ferrier and Apperly at Manly on Fri-
day. It was a four-ball best-ball match,
and the pairs finished level with best-
balls of 69. But it was no test. The
pros, weren’t really frying (the comedian
Ezar played several holes in a borrowed
bowler), and the amateurs were put off
by the festive spirit imparted to a solemn
occasion. Incidentally, if there is one
thing that is absolutely foreign to golf
it is levity. It has been said that the
surest way to lick a true Scot is to level
a few jokes at him before hitting off.
# jfc sj« *
“Enzed”: My tip is that the British
golfers, who arrived in Wellington (M.L.)
last week, and made a good showing at
Auckland on Saturday, will give far
more impressive displays than they did
in Australia. English though the weather
was during part of their tour, the pace of
the greens beat all of them except Mc-
Lean. Even Michael Scott, who is
familiar with Australian conditions, fluffed
many approaches after faultless shots
from the tees and through the fairways.
The British players would no doubt
endorse Sarazen’s confession: “I’d rather
approach a green from a bunker than
from a fairway.” Of course, he was re-
ferring to our bunkers, most of which,
relatively to the bona fide traps of Britain
and the U.S.A., aren’t bunkers at all.
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: The American profes-
sional golfers made a pretty good thing
of their tour of Australia, taking home
£3802 of the £4IOO prize-money they
competed for. As the Australian quid is
worth only a trifle over 16s. in N’Yark,
exchange will bite a good bit out of this,
but there will be something left to fight
depresh with. The Australian players
collected a bit under £3OO in cash, but
they got about a million’s worth in ex-
perience of the game as it is played by
champions.
* £ * H=
“Forsaken”: The decision of the
N.S.W. women golfers to legalise summer
golf (B. 12/12/’34) means that the game
will now be played officially the year
round. The craze for it in its proper
season has resulted in golf widowers hav-
ing a doughy time for long periods ; the
rapid and rabid increase of the bridge
mania has added to their woes. In a
short time one may confidently expect a
sharp rise in restaurant shares, while tin-
opener manufacturers may be counted
on to extend their premises, increase the
number of their employees and water
their stock.
* He * *
“Hotham”: Jock McLean, who stood
ouf head and shoulders above his mates
of the British team in the centenary and
other Australian tournaments, made
a handsome gesture in return for the hos-
pitality extended to himself and his
mates. He presented to the Vic. G.A.
the gold cup he won for the best
amateur score in the centenary open.
This is to serve as a trophy for an annual
tourney between Victorian amateurs, or
as the V.G.A. may decide.
* * * *
“Hell’s Bunkers”: 1 read in a daily that
Diegel, after surrendering his prohibited
putter, borrowed an orthodox weapon
from another player and commenced
“holing them from all angles.” Which
raises two interesting questions: (1) Is
it any more difficult to sink ’em from
one “angle” than from another? (2)
What is an angle in relation to a hole?
Racquet and Bawl
“Kooyong”: If next month’s tennis in
Melbourne becomes famous for nothing
else, it will go down to history as the
record meeting of freak champions. Be-
sides McGrath, with his double-fisted back-
hand, there will be Bromwich, who uses
both paws for his forehand drive, serves
and volleys with his right and employs
the left for ground shots on that side.
A third member of the dime museum, as
the Yanks would call it, is Stefani. He
plays left or right hand as occasion de-
mands, and seems equally deadly with
either fist.
H' * * *
“Gaspard”: That comment on the
money-grubbing tendencies of the Ma
State L.T.A. (B. 12/12/’34) is borne out
by the report of the decision of that
body to advocate the sending of a Davis
Cup team to Europe next year. Says the
newspaper account, “the decision was
unanimous in view of the handsome
profit made on this year’s tour.” No
mention of any other aspect of the tour,
you’ll note.
H= * H= *
“Fed Up”: As if the female of the
species was not being sufficiently diverted
from her natural sphere it is now pro-
posed by misguided folk on the other
side of the world to start a Davis Cup
section for her. There is argument as
to whether a new tourney be instituted
or the Wightman Cup scrap, which has
for some years been fought by teams
from England and America, be thrown
open to other nations. The world’s
minor activities are already clogged by
all sorts of useless and unproductive in-
ternational clashes between professors of
one foolish sport or another, both male
and female. The addition of one more
to the congested list is not to be thought
of.
* * * *
“Milton”: Queenslanders are notori-
ously lacking in veneration, and the fol-
lowers of sport up this way are particu-
larly so. Perry found, a year or so ago,
that tantrums were greeted not with
anger but with derision, which is infi-
nitely worse. Menzel, the towering
visitor from Czecho-Slovakia, has made
the same discovery. He had been show-
ing signs of impatience, when an infant
in one of the stands lifted up its voice
and wept. Menzel passionately appealed
for the removal of the offender. This
was too much for the crowd, which dis-

solved in tears of laughter. Had Menzel
joined in the laugh he would have taken
home with him the reputation of being
a genuine sportsman. As it was he
rushed the umpire with an appeal for
protection from “these cannibals.” That
tore it, of course, and the visitor found,
what all actors know, that the public
performer who talks back at his audience
is a gone coon.
* * * *
“Corrida”: It looks as if Tilden’s
tour of Europe giving exhibitions be-
tween his professionals and local talent
will be knocked back in countries other
than Belgium, which first handed him
the frozen mitt. The Spanish tennis heads
have issued an order to affiliated clubs
that they are on no account to recog-
nise the existence of the pestilent Ameri-
cano and his train of performers.
Neither purely professional meetings nor
mixed clashes will be permitted.
* * * *
“Eastbourne”: Sam Hoare, president
of the English Tennis Association, broke
new ground at the annual meeting when
he welcomed the professionals to the
L.T.A. fold, which once was guarded by
barbed-wire and Alsatian hounds against
their incursions. The L.T.A. has taken
charge of the professionals’ organisation,
and will arrange their tournaments and
championships. There is an analogy in
the British Football Association, which
is run solely by amateurs, though the
great majority of its clubs and players
are professional. The new move brings
nearer to fulfilment the removal of the
ban on the amateurs and paid men play-
ing together. They-can do it in golf,
cricket and Soccer football; it is high
time the example was followed in tennis.
Miscellaneous
Eddie Tolan has a university degree
behind him. The sports writers in Mel-
bourne got a shock when they found
Eddie learnedly discussing the infra-red
rays with some savant from Melbourne
University. Like other so-called profes-
sionals, Tolan claims to be seriously out
of pocket by his athletic devotion. Their
plaint on the financial side recalls the
story of the tennis pro. who confided
that if things didn’t get better he’d have
to “turn amateur.”
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: The English and Fin-
nish athletic teams which sailed last
week under the aegis of Victoria will be
permitted to come on to Sydney after
showing in Melbourne in January. The
opening date has been fixed for Feb-
ruary 2, but this will clash with the Tolan
professional sports, and the Cabbage
Gardeners are to be asked to alter the
date. There is another catch : Victoria
wants £2OO and first-class exes, for its
proteges, which, as Euclid would say, is
right over the fence. Athletic meetings
never draw bumper gates in Sydney as
other sports do, and £2OO will take some
raking together, to say nothing of extras.
* * * *
“Sinnet”: Some time ago The Bulle-
tin, commenting on the action of the
N.S.W. 18-footer heads in banning the
new style of “narrow” craft, although
several had been built' or were building,
said they were looking for trouble. The
first instalment was the abandonment of
the annual 18ft. Australian championship,
which has been a feature of Australian
sailing since the early ’nineties, this being
due to the fact that the “narrow” craft are
in general use in Queensland, where they
originated. The second batch is the for-
mation of anew 18ft. combination, to
be known as the League. This will fea-
ture the “narrow” 18’s and run in oppo-
sition to the senior organisation. The
whole business promises to give the al-
ready popular 16’s a firmer hold on
public favor, to the detriment of the
18’s, which years ago supplanted the 22-
footers in just the same fashion.
* * * *
“Splash”: The guardians of the sen-
sational new swimmer Billy Kendall are
to be commended for their decision not
to allow the East Sydney boy to burn
himself up, as is the fashion nowadays
when juvenile athletic prodigies burst
into view. His competitive appearances
are to be strictly rationed, and the appli-
cations for his appearance which have
been pouring in since the youngster broke
the Australian 75 yards record have gone
to the w.p.b. We have seen several in-
stances of these wonder children in ath-
letics and games being worked to death
to earn money for sport or games organi-
sations. It is an anomaly that the Gov-
ernment which limits the work of young
stars in the theatre, say, should make no
attempt to safeguard their contemporaries
in tennis and other branches of sport.

“Six Beat”: The two Japanese swim-
mers who began their tour of Australia
in Queensland last week should shake up
the best of our cracks when they get
acclimatised. Kiyokawa is world’s back-
stroke champion; Sakagami is 100-
metre champion of Japan, with a time
of 59sec. Before leaving for Australia he
defeated Myazaki, the Olympic cham-
pion for the sprints, for the Nipponese
title. After a tour of Bananaland coun-
try towns, the pair reach Sydney by
December 29 and go thence to Melbourne
for the Australian championships next
month.

“No Easy Way Out”
Mr. R. Adamson, of Caulfield (Vic.),
has written a long criticism of the article
published on September 26. Mr. Adam-
son says, in part:
The £lOO,OOO [theoretical savings of
10,000 salary-earners out of earnings] lent
and borrowed [i.e., invested at interest]
must have been used to produce capital
goods, not consumer goods. That is to
say, it must have been used for reproductive
purposes, which means that it would be put
into buildings, machinery and other equip-
ment for production. The commodities
produced are thereby extended and have
to be sold. They are added to the market,
which is already full, and it is this very
process of abstention from spending and
building up capital funds and capital
goods, or means of production, that leads
to the speculative turn of the trade cycle,
followed by the inevitable financial crash.
Why? Because all commodities that are
produced cannot be sold for all time, and
in the long run, at prices which are suffi-
cient to recover all the costs that have
entered into their production and distribu-
tion.
That will be near enough to Douglas’s
reasoning for most people, but Mr.
Adamson is obviously not a Douglasite
—he writes politely. He also admits that
“there are so many
phases to be con-
sidered, and in the
ramifications of
finance the mihd
goes round in
circles.”
But to criticise
his criticism. If
the £lOO,OOO of
savings be spent
on buildings and
other fixed assets,
it is distributed
amongst master
builders, machin-
ery merchants, en-
gineers and arti-
sans. These indi-
viduals don’t buy
machinery and city
buildings for their
own private use
any more than the
salary-earners who
invested £lOO,OOO
spend all their
money on lawsuits,
audit fees, food-
products, wool or
whatever walk of
life it is that they
are interested in.
The employees of
an industry don’t
necessarily distri-
bute their pur-
chasing power in
that industry. Actually, this £lOO,OOO
of purchasing power is distributed
among machinery-makers, builders and
their employees many years before
it can be recouped in depreciation
charges included in the cost of
goods. There are thus excesses of
purchasing power (apparent during
building and other booms) which result
in extravagant spending and unhealthy
speculation, and in subsequent slumps the
overhead charges, such as depreciation,
become burdensome. But there has been
no shortage of purchasing power over a
period of years; it has merely been
badly distributed.
Mr. Adamson again:
Certainly there is “no easy way out,” but
the trouble with some people is that they
do nothing but advocate the retention of
the ruthless system under which the major-
ity of men and women are sacrificed, by
mental and physical distress, in the sup-
posed interests of those in control and
possession of the tools of production and
the mythical money resources of the
country.
The “ruthless system” is meant for the
gold standard. The gold standard, as
The Bulletin’s previous article sug-
gested, was no more to blame and no
more ruthless than the commercial and
speculative world, politicians and trade-
unionists who influence 'it. The colossal
and disastrous gambling which preceded
the slump was not as involuntary as Mr.
Adamson appears to think; there are
always people, probably a majority of
people, who are ready to aid and abet
these “easy-money” conditions to the ex-
tent of their resources. And thus a com-
mercial boom develops into a financial
boom—and burst.
A New Film Co.
Mastercraft Film Corp. is seeking capi-
tal to buy “The Avenue” picnic grounds,
near Fig Tree (Lane Cove River, Syd-
ney), to establish a studio thereon and
to produce talking pictures. The pros-
pectus is a carefully-compiled affair on
which the directors are to be compli-
mented. They are asking for £47,250 in
20,000 8 p.c. cum. par. prefs. and 74,500
ords., all shares being of 10s. each. The
co. will not proceed to allotment until
50,000 shares have been subscribed, and
of the promoter’s consideration only £250
is payable in cash, the remainder (£2750)
being in ord. shares.
Raymond H. Longford is the pro-
moter. He passes over two scenarios,
and gets a contract as producer for five
years at £1250 a year. He has had a
long apprenticeship in the Australian
picture-production industry (which may
or may not be an advantage), in the
talkie business having been associated
with Thring’s Efftee Studios, Pat Hanna
Productions and Beaumont Smith, of
J.C.W.’s Picture Corp.
The co. has an option, over “The
Avenue,” a 161-acre block, from the
“Did I get his. number, ye ask? I did that, and this very night I’ll ring him up.”
land-holding pup of Sydney Ferries.
Price is £9250, and the option expires on
Dec. 31. The claim that the location is
a good one seems to be reasonable.
On the minimum capital (£25,000) the
co. estimates that it will be able to buy
the land (subject to a £5OOO mortgage),
spend £3600 on buildings, £4150 on
camera and electrical equipment, and
produce two films, £5OOO and £4OOO each
respectively. In the first stages the sound
equipment will be rented from Harring-
tons. Film processing is to be done out-
side.
Even if this concern is able to produce
good-quality films their successful exhi-
bition will depend a good deal upon an
Australian film quota. Many Australian
films so far produced have been turned
out by subsidiary interests of the picture-
house combine, and whatever their suc-
cess has been is no criterion as far as
outside producers are concerned. The
case of Mastercraft Film Corp., appar-
ently a genuine effort to develop an inde-
pendent Australian film industry, should
be carefully considered by Governments
before arriving at a decision on the film-
quota question.
German wool buyers will probably
start operating on the S’African market
almost immediately as a result of nego-
tiations between the Governments of the
two countries on the matter of financing
the purchases. The financial arrange-
ments, details of which are not to hand,
but which apparently include a barter
agreement amounting to £2,500,000,
at present are tentative; but they are
expected to be extended to a “compre-
hensive plan that will cover the whole
of Germany’s requirements of South
African wool.” As against 134,000 bales
in the first three months of last season,
Germany has bought only 15,000 bales
from Australia in the same period this
year. In addition to the wool thus left
on our hands there has been a marked
effect on competition. Federal Govern-
ment is endeavoring to effect a trade
agreement with the Vaterland.

At the N.S.W. Chamber of Manufac-
turers’ dinner last week Customs Minister
White, in reply to Mr. Potts’s criticism
of the recent tariff amendments, quoted
the improvement in employment during
the Lyons regime, and attributed it to
tariff revision. These same unemploy-
ment figures are quoted nearly every
time the Government policy on any ques-
tion is attacked. The improvement in
employment obviously can’t be entirely
due to each of a dozen different causes ;
last season’s recovery in wool, actually
the biggest factor, is scarcely mentioned.

The proposal of the S.A. Gas Co. to
impose a monthly service charge of 2s.
on accounts, and to reduce the rate on
higher consumption in order to encour-
age custom, resulted In the Housewives’
Association calling a public meeting
in Adelaide. According to the co., small
accounts don’t pay—especially where
gas is connected to a dwelling merely
as a standby in the case of failure
of other heat or lighting supply.
Its secretary asserts that users of
1500 c.f. a month will save lid. and
those charged for 3000 c.f. 4s. Id. under
the new scheme. The small consumer
would be charged more ; for 400 c.f. he
would' pay at the rate of 9s. 4d. a thou-
sand, plus 2s. service charge. Small con-
sumers, of course —they include unem-
ployed—are having a lot to say about
the proposal.

Burns Philp has bought the Nord-

Australian imports of motor-cars for
the 10 months to October show an in-
crease of 167 p.c. compared with the
same period of 1933. American cars
are again figuring largely. Imports of
chassis from Britain numbered 11,196, as
against 6803, from Canada 14,918 v
(4389), U.S.A. 14,288 (3893), other coun-
tries 73 (59). Britain has slipped from
first to third place on the score of num-
bers, but in values retains the lead at
£1,162,261. Canadian cars were valued
at £810,337, and U.S.A. at £1,092,020.
The average American chassis this year
cost £76, as against £B3 in 1933. The
average English model, however, rose
from £9O to just under £lOO. Canadian
chassis are cheapest at £54.

Westralian State Arbitration Court has
granted miners an average increase of
about Bs. a week, estimated to add £l6OO
a week to the wages bill on the Golden
Mile, where about 4000 men are em-
ployed. Lake View and Star, according
to some authorities, will be hit to the
tune of £3200 a month. Still, miners arc
entitled to share in the good things
going.

W. S. Robinson has no fears about
the price of gold. Though fluctuations
are certain to occur, the trend is still
upward, and 6dwt. ore, he says, should
continue to be as attractive as 10 and

N. S. Wales oranges ex the Vestey
freighter Stuart Star have turned out
well in London, but other shipments
have been unsatisfactory. South Aus-
tralia’s Trade Commissioner McCann
has received contracts or firm offers
from Scandinavia for 80,000 cases of
the State’s apples for delivery next season.

The shortage of profitable outlets for
investment of savings, combined with
a healthier tone in the building and real-
estate businesses, has resulted in a re-
vival of mortgage transactions in N. S.
Wales. Only twice during 1934 has the
monthly total of mortgage registrations
fallen below £1,000,000 ; in 1933, on the
other hand, only twice was the million
mark touched, and in 1932 not at all.
For the ten months to October 31 last
new loans and renewals totalled
£12,708,000, compared with £9,605,000
and £8,642,000 for the whole of 1933
and 1932 respectively. In the follow-
ing table, compiled by Statistician
Waites, the proporton of each month’s
mortgage business is classified according

The downward trend of the cost of
mortgage accommodation is plainly
shown. Up to the end of 1933 the pre-
vailing interest rate was mostly between
5 p.c. and 6 p.c. From the beginning
of this year the rate began to swing
more into the 4\ p.c. to 5 p.c. class, while
at present a great deal of money is
being put out at under 4\ p.c.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
“Dickie Beech”: The ducal visit to
the Queensland North Coast nearly came
to a watery termination during a run
outside the mouth of the Mooloolah
River in a small speed launch doing 20
knots. An unusually high tide had floated
sundry logs and trees off the beaches,
and one of these, riding just awash in
the choppy sea, barely missed the lightly-
built craft. Near water-level, such
dangers are impossible to see until one
is on them, and frantic wavings from a
headland were not noticed. At that speed
she would have gone into staves on im-
pact, with highly unpleasant consequences
to the occupants.

The Central Court of Papua has put
up a record for the Empire in Supreme
Court justice. Wari Kuni walked into
the Cosmopolitan Hotel at Samarai at
5 a.m. and proceeded to go through
somebody’s pockets, oblivious of the fact
that Sergeant Daguna, of the A.N.C., also
was in the room. Later in the day he
was committed to
have an interview
with Mr. Justice
Murray. When the
next 5 a.m. arrived
he had served sev-
eral hours of a sen-
tence of three years’
hard.

“Bitter Bark”:
Jap lugger crews
working along our
coasts do not con-
fine their activities
to collecting pearl-
shell and trochus.
Cowries and smaller
shells, with which
the reefs abound,
are fair game, too.
These are sent to
Japan, where they
are cleverly com-
bined and painted to
represent a variety
of birds. Then,
mounted on cherry-
wood stands, they
are returned to
N.Q., where they
meet with a ready
sale.
“Vic”: We north-
erners may have had
a depression, but we
are still prudent.
During the years
1930-33 new life in-
surance policies
were written in
Queensl and for
£18,495,746, which is
equal to about £2l
cover for every head
of population. Can
any other new coun-
try beat that?
* * *
“Namanula”: Fol-
lowing an inquiry in
Rabaul into alleged
cruelties practised on
native prisoners in
the calaboose, there
have been revolu-
tionary changes. The once-familiar
spectacle of convict road-gangs being
worked under native police has van-
ished. Prisoners are now given break-
fast, which consists of brown bread,
milkless tea and brown sugar. Boiled
rice makes its appearance at midday, and
rumor madly adds that yet a further meal
of taro and tinned bulumakau is served
at night. Convicts are acquiring a sleek
and greasy appearance which is exciting
the envy of indentured laborers, and
many of the latter are now awaiting the
first favorable opportunity of taking a
holiday.
* * * *
“Hamer”: North Australia and neigh-
boring parts are teaching the world the
full usefulness of the aeroplane. New
Guinea is the only country where the
bulk of the carrying, including big
dredges, other machinery, pianos and
livestock, is done by air; and the
northern part of the continent has found
uses for the ’plane beyond bearing pas-
sengers and mails and enlarging the
orbits of flying doctors and clergymen.
There is an air fish and fresh-vegetable
delivery now to towns which formerly
did without; and this year’s inspection of
the 10,600-square-mile Alexandria sta-
tion (which is about the size of Bel-
gium) shows another usefulness. Directors
Collins and Phil Forrest went by air,
covering 4000 air miles in six days.
’Planes are used, too, for locating cattle
on big stations.
* * * *
“Calico Wings”: As the doyen of
Queensland drovers I nominate H. E.
(Bert) Tucker, who has been on the roads
with his own plant for about 40 years.
Six times or oftener he has retired, but
always has gone back to the roads. As
a youngster in Longreach (Q.) I even
yet remember the thrill I got out of talk-
ing to a boss drover —young Bert, as he
was then. Other drovers might rival
Bert’s time on the roads, but 1 do not
think any of them have his versatility.
Tommy Laffin and Ted Larkins and
Adam Wightman, if they are alive, have
been coming and going for a generation
or so, but they specialise in cattle and
one long trip a year. They don’t touch
sheep. Bert takes ’em as they come,
going here, there and everywhere. The
first time I saw him was in the late ’nine-
ties with sheep. The last time 1 met him
“Hi, cut out that smokin'! Last man that smoked down
there blew up four men.”
“It’s all right, boss — there’s only meself down here.”
was early in ’lB. He was working cattle,
and we were both camped on the banks
of Gidyea Creek, Barkly Tableland,
flood-bound, with but half a tin of jam,
half a loaf of damper and half a pound
of tea between us.

“N’lmporte”: P. Stanhope Hobday,
who represents the Brisbane artists in the
Queensland Authors and Artists’ Asso-
ciation, has been elected president of that
body for the fourth year in succession.
The association was born just after the
war, and was very virile for some years,
but of recent years it has been sinking
steadily into a status little more impor-
tant than that of a bun-eating gathering.
During the year, too, the association’s
offspring, the Sketch Club, died after a
short illness which was hastened by the
literal death of its chairman, J. H. Harte.

a Port Moresby-buili cutter without

“Brum”: That par. about the old
British custom of nailing counterfeit
coins to shop counters (B. 21/11/’34)
recalls a bit of verse once popular as a
recitation at church concerts which had
for its hero a gentleman who applied
the adage “That coin is spurious ; nail it
down” to anything which invited his sus-
picions. Writer’s only personal experi-
ence was at the Two Mile, a once-'
famous pub outside Cooktown on the
Palmer road which had been the “first
and last” from and to the old-time gold-
field. Over 30 years ago a party rode
out from Cooktown to inspect the de-
serted old shanty. The bar still stood,
and at one end was covered with copper
and brass coinage firmly nailed to the
wood. All the nations of the world were
customers of the Two Mile in those
days, and their cash was'as mixed as
they were themselves.

“Retired Burglar”: Don’t be foolish,
“Vic” (B. 5/12/’34), about the city un-
employed coming up to the Gulf coun-
try to see cattle and blacks (even if not
too wild) and goat farms and mounted
police. We’re better off with Stevens,
and Forgie Smith, and the pictures, and
the pub just round the corner, and the
papers to tell us what the capitalists have
done to Kisch and Griffin, and the
doctor and nurse handy when the missus
earns the baby bonus. And only one
politician to every 100,000 square miles?
Cripes, how does a bloke get a job up
there? “Vic” may crack hardy, and even
be one of them pioneering blokes, but
if he got a good job on relief work, with
easy money for leaning on a shovel, he’d
give up the notions about romance.
What grandpa did is old stuff —and
grandpa’s dead, anyhow. “Vic” sounds
about 18 ; if he’s older, how does his
wife like it? That kind always has a
wife after about' 18.

“Kaevieng”: The visitor to New
Guinea is often surprised to learn that
there are no public hospitals in the terri-
tory. Although the planters and miners
pay for the upkeep of an expensive
medical department which caters for the
natives free of charge, they themselves
have to pay £1 per day for hospital
accommodation.

“Murlonga”: I reckon “D.H.0.”
comes nearest the method of handling
abos. than any other authority I have
read (B. 28/11 /’34). Personality all
the time; it doesn’t matter a tinker’s
cuss what shape it runs to. I’ve known
fellows free and easy with their boys
who got dumb devotion from every man.
I know men who could lead boys to hell
and back again who were strict with
them to the point of harshness. Further,
the ability to handle boys isn’t hereditary.
My father was noted for his ability with
blacks. Understanding their mental out-
look, and sympathising with them, he
stood over them. I gave them better
treatment; didn’t interfere with them ;
left the handling and working of
them entirely to my head stock-
man ; my only interest in them was
to see they were well treated. And I
only had to go on to a station, or the
blacks only had to have a whisper that
I was coming, and they faded from
sight like dingoes slinking into a scrub!
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
H.M.A.S. Australia, with the Duke of
Gloucester on board, steamed down the Bris-
bane River in pouring rain. Notabilities,
with or without umbrellas, stood about drenched
and shivering. Even the Duke’s Australian ter-
riers shivered their way up the gangway.
With his white tropical uniform stuck to
his limbs with moisture, the Duke inspected
a dripping escort and a soaking naval guard
of honor. Then our Sir Leslie went on board
to say good-bye, and a little later the G.-G.,
Sir Isaac Isaacs, came along, inspected the
guard some more and also went on board to
make his farewells.
All the way down the river tooting motor-
cars lined the banks and wet flags waved.
In addition to the usual addresses, the Duke’s
gifts included a stockwhip which veteran
Dan Hackett had just been whirling round his
own head, two handsome tea-trays of Queens-
land timber from the members of Parlia-
ment, and a table he had admired in his re-
ceptibn-room at Parliament House in which
over 5000 pieces of Queensland woods were
inlaid. A beautifully-made cigar box came
from the Adult Deaf and Dumb factory.
The Duke’s equerry, Captain Howard Kerr,
M.V.0., left a cup with the Marist Brothers
at their college at Rosalie for annual competi-
tion in the senior boxing division. It is a
handsome trophy, and the lads will submit even
more eagerly than ever to blackened eyes and
loosened teeth in the hope of having their
names engraved on it.
Jean Batten, wearing plaid taffetas in tones
of black and red, created almost as much inter-
est at the launching of the Australia-London
airliner as royalty. She was with Captain and
Mrs. Bird and Mrs. John Collins in the reserved
enclosure, where were parked State Ministers
and Judges and the naval and military and
their womenfolk.
Miss Kitty Warren White went to Mel-
bourne to be present at the wedding of her
niece, the Brudenell Whites’ daughter. Mrs.
Hutchison and Neth go down to join her and
to take part in a Christmas family reunion.
Captain T. J. Robertson, harbormaster at
Brisbane, piloted the Australia to Cowan-
Cowan, off Moreton Island; then, drenched to
the skin, was presented to the Duke. There
were three other notable master mariners in
Brisbane at the time. One was Captain H. L.
Upton, master of the motor-boat Durham,
who has a D.S.C. and a Croix de Guerre;
Captain A. S. M. Nicholls, D. 5.0., 0.8. E.,
R.D., R.N.R., marine superintendent in Aus-
tralia for the Canadian National, who got his
decorations “for a little submarine job” and
convoy work in the North Atlantic; and
Captain Evan P. Cameron, R.D., R.N.R.,
commander of the Orient liner Orama, who
commanded the transport Rio Negro during
the war and rescued thousands of Russian
refugees afterwards.
The royal at-home on H.M.A.S. Australia
was gay with red-and-white awnings and flut-
tering pennants.
Guests were received at the head of the
gangway by Captain W. S. B. Macleod and
Commander H. B. Farncomb, and the hosts
included about 50 officers who were returning
hospitality shown to them by longshore lads
and lasses while the Australia was in the riyer.
The ship’s band provided sufficient musical
selections to make everyone feel in the proper-
party spirit, and then turned to dance numbers.
Blair, C.J., and his wife, the Lord and Lady
Mayoress, with daughters Ina and Dorothy,
Archbishop Wand and his wife and daughter,
several Judges and their wives, Commander
and Mrs. McFarlane, Brigadier-General and
Mrs. Ralph and daughter Eileen, Colonel and
Mrs. E. C. P. Plant, Colonel and Mrs.
Lorenzo and daughter Merle were in the throng.
There also was a bevy of pretty girls, rather
inclined to turn up their noses at mere
civilians after the naval and military partners
they have been parading for the last few days.
Molly de Gunst, who appeared with the
Brisbane Austral Choir in “The Messiah,” was
the guest of honor at a party arranged by
the Catholic Daughters of Australia in their
clubrooms. Golden marigolds and white shasta
daisies made the lounge gay. The proceeds
go to provide Christmas cheer for the sea-
side homes. Mrs. W. A. Stafford and Mrs.
J. M. Boland received the guests, and Jean
Naylor looked after the musical programme.
Archbishop Wand’s wife went along to see
the work of the deaf and dumb workers at
the factory, and at morning-tea the workers
presented to her a box of inlaid silky oak.
Mrs. L. S. Cook, Mrs. R. Malcolm, Mrs.
E. M. Ralph and Miss M. A. Ogg were the
hostesses.
Audrey Forth and Tom Warland were mar-
ried in Bombay on Tuesday; and on the pre-
vious day another member of the Forth family,
brother C. E., who lives at Eltham (M.L.),
married Jean Lash at New Plymouth.
Mr. and Mrs. Max Way gave a cocktail
party in honor of Sir Alan Anderson, 0.8. E.
(of the Orient Co., Ltd.), and Mr. D. L.
Dowdell, who were here for the wireless launch-
ing of the Orion.
Sir Leslie Wilson, attended by Pat Honnor,
A.D.C., and accompanied by Lady and Miss
Wilson, went along to the military tattoo at the
Exhibition, which drew an immense crowd.
Orme Bell, who is staying at Government
House, was with the vice-regal party, and also
in the box were Major-General Howard Vyse
(the Duke’s Chief of Staff),, the Lord and Lady
Mayoress, Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Moore, Cap-
tain Macleod, of H.M.A.S. Australia, Com-
mander and Mrs. McFarlane and Brig.-Gen.
and Mrs. E. M. Ralph. An aerial combat
and a reproduction of the defence of Rorke’s
Drift were the thrills of the evening.
January 24 has been fixed for the altar date
of Merle Lorenzo, daughter of Colonel and
Mrs. Lorenzo, and Mr. A. Allen. Christ
Church, Milton, will see the ceremony, and the
reception is to be held at the mess at the bar-
racks. Aura Forster will bridesmaid, and
Captain Bruce Watchorn is to be best man.
Dr. Peter Newton Macgregor, eldest son
of Macgregor, K.C., and Mrs. Macgregor, mar-
ried Margaret Bennett at All Saints’. Cap-
tain Frank Newton, formerly Sir Herbert
Chermside’s A.D.C., who now lives at Stan-
thorpe, came down for the wedding, and was
his nephew’s best man.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Elizabeth Knox slipped into matrimony
by grace of St. Mary’s last week. The
wedding was a surprise to all but the
family circle.- No wedding-dress or veil,
no flutter of bridesmaids surrounded the
vows. In the noon-day hour Father Bart-
lett linked her to her ’groom, who is
Lewis Joseph Hugh Clifford, chairman of
Hume Steel and Hume Pipe, and comes
from Melbourne.
The bride wore an ensemble, the coat
of sapphire, the frock of skyey-blue. Her
brat was a dull-blue baku, and she pinned
blue and gold orchids on her coat. Sister
Mrs. Poole belted her beige-pink crepes
in navy, and her navy hat was circled with
a beige-pink ribbon. The jubilations took
the form of a small-size lunch-party at
the Australia.
A little forest of Christmas-trees, each
ringed by children with clapping hands,
above each a star gleaming, flourished
gaily for two nights in the Town Hall.
It was the combined Christmas party of
the Kindergarten Union, and youngsters
from Surry Hills and Newtown, Little
Citizens, Golden Fleecers and Bluebirds,
blithely piped their lays or, led by teacher,
played their pretty games. Within the
magic ring of childhood were set tiny
tables, each with its bowl of flowers.
Around them sat the guests, each topped
with a smart paper cap, the Christmas-
bell ones being the prettiest of all.
Around every group of youngsters sat
their parents, aunts or big sisters, and the
trees bloomed with a gift for each —the
work of the baby hands.
South Australia’s former Governor,
Archibald Weigall, is now head serang
of the Royal Empire Society in London.
The Sydney branch therefore produced
one of its best lunches in his honor, and
the usual myriads of guests champed
their way through three courses of the
products of Empire. With Sir Archi-
bald came his wife and bright and alert
daughter Priscilla. The vice-regal Games
were there, more or less secondary con-
siderations in that the full voltage of
limelight was switched on to Sir Archi-
bald, though for one glad moment secre-
tary W. G. Layton was caught in its
beam. This was when between the grape-
fruit and the chicken he arose and
proffered posies to Lady Game and to
Lady Weigall. After compliments had
been passed and the work of the society
explained graphically by Sir Archibald,
John Shepherd’s turn arrived. He is the
winner of the Walter Frewin Lord prize
for an essay on Australian and Imperial
history. Quite a win, as the competition
yvas open to the British Empire.
The Queen of Hearts stood at the top of
the gangway in gleaming white satins, on
her head a coronet of ruby-red hearts.
On one side of her stood the Mad Hatter,
on the other Mary, Mary, Quite Con-
trary. With such a beginning the party
on the Cathay last Thursday spun mer-
rily to success. The P. and O. liner had
the appearance very ‘early in the after-
noon of being the rallying ground of all
the children in Sydney, and one com-
mittee member did murmur something
about more than 1200 being aboard just
after 2.30, starting-off time. Some young-
sters had got there ahead of the clock,
and were biting into their ices before the
just-punctuals had leaped aboard. It
was a grand party, and you could play
with 80-Peep and Alice in Wonderland.’
Mother Hubbard was in charge of a cup-
board that wasn’t bare but full of magic
lucky packets. There were grown-ups,
too, among them Lady Game, Premier
Stevens’s wife and Mayoress Parker. The
Australian Mothercraft Society benefited.
This is Claudia Beazley, who spread hex-
social wings during the royal visit. She
is a Queenslander whose family spends
six months of the year at Vaucluse and
the other six on their station at Emerald.
Surfing and golfing are Miss Beazley’s
two favorite recreations. Sister Joyce,
who left Australia under Miss Crowdy’s
wing, is still fluctuating between the
Crowdy home in London and the Con-
tinent.
For song-lovers the event of the week
was the Musical Association’s greeting to
Ben Fuller’s opera artists. In the usual
way the visitors were solaced with music
before being ushered downstairs to listen
to speeches. While ordinary mortals sit-
ting afar off in Farmer’s huge dining-
room can retire behind a smokescreen
of coffee, sandwiches and whispered
gossip, top-table people have to listen.
Broadcasting-director Cleary’s speech
was an instance of speech being more
golden than silence when he told of
A.B.C. engagements when the opera
season is over. Mrs. Cleary, in gaily-
flowered crepes, was with her husband.
Ben Fuller’s lady came in vellum laces.
Muriel Brunskill, a pleasing personality,
shone out in black and silver and long
earrings. Con. Director Bainton
brought a lotus-blue-clad daughter ; fur-
edged was the short coat to Mrs. Doug-
las’s turquoise-blue frock. The men of
the company have those comfortable
deep chests that promise notes well sos-
tenuto; they all greeted concert-manager
Gravestock as an old friend, and suffered
with the greatest amiability long strings
of introductions. Florence Austral didn’t
turn up. She is wisely declining social
engagements until after her opening
night. Local girls Alice Prowse and Joan
Hammond, with coach Lute Drummond,
were all excitement. They make an
operatic start as Valkyrie maidens.
If there were any generals at the
Grammar School Dettmanns reception
last week they must have made up their
quarrel with caviare—for that and the
girl cricketers, the principal ingredients,
went with a bang. The reception-rooms
of the Queen’s Club buzzed at this merry
before-Christmas party, to which half
of Sydney seemed to drop in.
When the Dettmans give a party they
let people talk, unhampered by long
sessions of musical sound. That’s why
the Law always turns up in force. The
Philip Streets, the Ken Streets and the
Justice Maxwell couple were one little
group of the torts and retorts fraternity.
Premier Stevens’s Gwen was there with
her mother, and Doctor Constance
D’Arcy brought black laces and her gay
little laugh.
Mrs. Dettmann’s
frock was hand-
some, long and
held the gleams of
a dark amethyst.
Denise, in a trained
frock, green as a
lily-pond, and Ellis,
in a dashing little
backless frock of
red-an d-white
checks, helped
mother. From
North Shore came
the John Butters
couple, Sir Hugh
Poynter and his
lady, Mrs. Baume,
in trailing mignon-
ette green lace,
and Mary Mac-
Cormick, in a flow-
ered frock as gay
as a bed of tulips.
From Darling
Point there were
Mrs. Albert Little-
john, Miss M. Fair-
fax and Mrs.
Arthur Eedy. Mrs.
Godhard’s tur-
quoise blues
gleamed against
Mrs. Florence Tay-
lor’s black velvet.
Betty Archdale,
who captains the
English team, was
shining-eyed and
black - frocked.
Margaret Peden,
who skippered the
N.S.W. women
cricketers, had her brown laces tied with
a sash red as a Virginia creeper. The
visitors run to gleaming hair and teeth,
blue eyes and the most comprehensive
sunburn.
The Savoy was crowded for the joint
recital of Gladys Verona and pianist
Charles Philip. Gladys brought a sway-
ing frock of lobelia-blue satin and silver
lace made in the Pompadour style and
a high, clear and flexible voice. The
pianist brought the exquisite grace and
precision with which he played Mar-
tini’s Gavotte, the force and poetic
drama of the Bach D Minor Toccata and
Fugue. The soprano went singing across
the fields of opera and the moderns, fling-
ing out a starburst by Mozart, a polished
phrase of Hugo Wolf’s. Afterwards the
two threw a monster supper party amid
the massed-up flowers, the rugs and
gleaming brasses of Vere Mathews’s club
in George-street.
There is something in being the daugh-
ter of Sydney’s most popular Consul.
When Sophie Segaert, younger daughter
of Belgium’s C.G., was married last week
Sydney’s other Consuls and their wives
united and sent along a luxurious dress-
ing-case, its fittings of tortoiseshell.
Sophie, who became the wife of barrister
Frazer B. Coss in Neutral Bay’s pretty
little church of St. Augustine’s, wore
a frock of softest blue, spattered
with sprays of lily-of-the-valley. Blue
of a deeper tone, down which twinkled
diamente buttons, was brought by Mrs.
Andre Brenac, the bride’s sister, who
was matron of honor. ’Maid Dorothy
Coss had lace ruffles on her pink crepes,
and carried a posy of blue and pink.
The wedding dinner was a strictly family
affair at the Segaert home.
In a room of the Women’s Club set
about with pieces of her koala pottery,
Theo Cowan held a reception last week,
and professional women and the wives of
the rich and knighted dropped in to
secure still another bowl of lagoon blues
of malachite glaze. One buyer was one of
the Doulton-ware heads, and an enviable
poppy-yellow glaze flower trough was
going up to Canberra. A sweet dish'
that holds the greens and blues of a
beetle’s wings and has a beautifully-
modelled kookaburra for handle goes
off as a wedding present to Jill Ryan,
who marries her Raymond Lambert on
Christmas Eve. Incidentally, it is in-
teresting to the Australian about to visit
Italy to learn that the first example of
the Australian sculptor’s work is to be
found in the sloried old church of San
Miniato in Florence.
The only spot man can now call his
own is the prize-ring. As a public
speaker woman has begun to snatch the
spotlight. Sitting in the ballroom at
Nancy Jobson’s school, Hopewood
House, last week, the listener heard a
clutch of self-possessed girl orators as
far removed from the Victorian miss as
their frocks were from the fig-leaves of
Eve. The orations were judged by C. N.
Baeyertz and Justice Halse Rogers, and
among the hundred or more interested
listeners was Lady Game, her soft
chiffons patterned in blue. Striking-
looking Betty Culpan brought the agi-
tation of floral blue and gold to her
dramatic outburst as Voltaire. Isobel
Mackenzie, who championed Ireland as
Gladstone, displayed a marvellous feat
of memory, and in her long speech never
once referred to notes. Betty Shannon,
a burning flame in primrose chiffons,
breathed war against the capitalist. She
explained afterwards that she chose to
interpret Lenin because she had always
wanted to address the world as “Com-
rades!” Pitt and Dan O’Connell and
Major Douglas had their views ex-
pounded, coldly, emotionally or at high
voltage, by these just-beginning young
women. In between the air was sprayed
with song, while masses of hydran-
gea gazed down from nook and cranny,
cool and dewy-eyed.
Who’s afraid of a silver-fox? Not
Alexander Gordon’s lady. She supported
one with an air of cool nonchalance in
Friday’s sudden heat when she helped
open the new rooms of the Independent
Theatre group. This is mainly a long
and wide studio in King-street between
Pitt and Castlereagh streets. It is admir-
ably situated, for there is a florist on the
ground-floor where patrons can buy one
another bouquets ; also an eating-house
where tissues can be refreshed during
rehearsals. Over 200 were received by
producer Doris Fitton, who had gauntlet
cuffs and deep revers of pleated white
organdie on her flamisol ensemble.
Knights and their ladies, professors’ wives
and Mrs. Bernard Muscio, hordes of
young things arrayed like flowers of the
field, among them Jocelyn Poynter and
Anne Gordon, Harry Tighe, in a grey suit,
and Don Finley, his head fitted nicely
into a dream of pageantry, were among
the teacup jugglers.
If you are a sallow woman and have
always foregone the desire of your
heart —a royal-blue dress and hat —be-
cause you didn’t want to look like a
curry gone wrong, lift up your eyes and
clash a cymbal to the priestesses of
Venus. With the proper make-up you
can put out your tongue at Nature and
wear any color in the spectrum. At a
beauty talk the other day this Letter saw a
sallow girl with a thin face, patted and
creamed and tinted, smile, triumph-
antly nonchalant, over any and every
shade. Color has met its Waterloo!

Chatter
Old Father Christmas has popped a
few new toys into his sack for this year’s
visitation. His toy aeroplanes have com-
modious hangars with workshops and
petrol bowsers ; streamlined models have
emerged from his motor-body works, and
low, sleek speedboats that keep dashing
round and round are destined to terrify
the goldfish on somebody’s lilypond.
There are quaint toys which look like
very polite and well-brought-up little
pigs—they have piggy faces but no tails,
and they walk upright, wearing cricket
caps. Other playthings with long, skinny
legs clad in tight trousers, long coat-tails
and huge bulgy eyes are suspected of
belonging to the grasshopper family—
but Melbourne zoologists are not com-
mitting themselves on the question.
Among the teddies and koalas are a life-
like black magpie and a very black abo.,
his ribs outlined in white paint and in
his hand a long warlike spear.
Dolls with pretty faces are still a heavy
item in the Christmas expenditure, es-
pecially if small nieces mqst be remem-
bered as well as small daughters. But
rubber toys are down to bedrock. Four
and a half feet of tame shark, colored a
lovely sea-green, with fins for balancing
himself, will support anyone who doesn’t
mind a ducking when a large wave
comes. Grandfather shark, who has huge
inflated flippers attached to his six feet
of length, invites passengers to do a
trip on his back around the bay. But
strong swimmers only should accept—
for one never knows with sharks. This
one might turn his nose towards the
Heads and the open sea.
Men are putting off the evil hour of
buying presents for women. Finally at
the last moment they push their way into
the maelstrom and pay twice as much
as they intended to give for something
recommended by the salesgirl. For their
menfolk women are hunting about
among pipes, wallets, books, shirts,
pyjamas and beach wear. Plain women
of middle-age, with work-worn hands
and tired faces, are carefully measuring
their shillings so that the family will have
its plum pudding and bonbons. In their
parcel are included a pair of hectically-
striped socks and an extra cheerful tie
for dad “to make him feel young again.”
Most godparents don’t take their status
very seriously beyond providing a chris-
tening mug for a squealing infant, giving
it rattles and teddy-bears during its
toddling days and, when it becomes a
schoolchild, books on birthdays with
spots of unattractive advice in between.
But Joan Nanson’s godmothers don’t
come under this category. They are a
pair of good sports who rose to the occa-
sion of their goddaughter’s coming-of-
age with a dance at Carmyle, Toorak.
Mrs. Ivan Maxwell waved her wand in
red-currant ninon, and Mrs. J. H. Bailey
fingered hers in nutmeg lace mixed with
georgette. Miss Nanson wore ciel-blue
satin, moulded and trained. This young
fully-fledged citizen is the daughter of
Prof, and Mrs. E. J. Nanson.
Almost as rapidly as the floodwaters
rose is the relief fund mounting. The
floors were christened at Chevron with
this new private hotel’s first dance, held
in aid of the flood sufferers. Owing to
the 300 guests present owning such a
large percentage of cars among them, the
almost-unknown spectacle arose of a
twinkling row of tail-lights along the
middle as well as the side track of St.
Kilda-road. A box of silk stockings was
raffled and won by Nell Stewart (of
Perth), who returned the package to be
auctioned, with the result that another
£5 came flowing in. A box of chocs,
ran up to £6. Many guests brought bath-
ing costumes, but after feeling the tem-
perature of the water and the strength
of the wind decided to postpone a plunge
in the swimming pool. Mrs. John Dun-
can wore black. Vera Whiting, in blue
and cream, entertained a large party.
In the middle of the strenuous cham-
pionship tennis, Cliff Sproule seemed to
be enjoying himself. Mrs. Hickie sold
raffle tickets glad in fluffy figured georg-
ette and a long creepy train. Mrs. Gavin
Doxey wore a creation of pastel merg-
ings. Mrs. J. Douglas was among the
card-wielders who were to be found in
private dining-rooms and on every land-
ing. Among the young things were Merri
Cohen, in black ; Joan Ramsey, with a
ruffle round the neck of a garment upon
which was waged a war between green
and black checks, and Brenda Payne, in
a floral dress and a little green coat. The
sum cleared was in the region of £lOO.
At the International Club’s afternoon
receptions, there are usually no men
present, or perhaps one or two lonely
ones (if two, each very glad to see the
other). But last week a consul was
guest of honor, and the male element
rose to the occasion by leaving offices
early or cutting a usual game of golf.
The reception was held for Dr. Koeltzsch,
who, after a gap of six years, comes to
provide Melbourne once again with a
German consulate. Dr. Koeltzsch is a
Doctor of Laws, was educated for the
diplomatic service, was German Consul
in Mexico and for three years was
attached to the consular corps in Sydney.
His wife is at present abroad.
Dr. Koeltzsch was prepared for being
asked his preference between Sydney and
Melbourne, and commenced his speech
by stating that he liked both. Brig.-
General Jess gave a brief address in
which he stressed the importance of
tolerance and the spirit of give-and-take
as a means of promoting international un-
derstanding and world peace. He added
that these words might seem strange
from the lips of a soldier, but soldiers
didn’t make wars.
Mrs. Jess wore a miniature patterning
of white leaves on black voile with' split-
open shoulders and a shiny-black hat
with frontal trimmings. Mrs. W. Win-
kinson’s black frock was penny-spotted
with white. Mrs. P. D. Phillips chose
black crepes scattered with red roses,
Mrs. J. D. Moylan wore floral crepe, and
Betty Wood blue speckled with white.
Among guests who were brought face
to face with the small red poppy in Dr.
Koeltzsch’s buttonhole were Judge Fos-
ter, Mr. and Mrs. Dreiheller, Mr. and
Mrs. Thorvaldson, Mr. and Mrs. F. M.
Marcard, Dr. Georgina Sweet and G. J.
Coles.
Last week Theo Gibb lifted her pre-
sentation gown from its nest of tissue-
paper and lavender sachets and slid into
its sculptured sheath of blush-pink satin
for her dance at No. 9. The gown was
cut to a sleeveless, cowl-necked inspira-
tion. Miss Gibb has lately returned to
Melbourne after spending two years
abroad, and the party was her mother’s
and brother’s welcome home. Mrs. W. V.
Gibb wore a gown of desert-sand lace
with a cape to provide it with a sugges-
tion of sleeve and a brief following of
train. Her sister, Mrs. O. Pitt, was also
in lace, her color-note being a pale
powder-pink. Mrs. Gibson Shaw chose
luscious claret velvet. Margaret Thomp-
son’s pastei-blue frock had a windblown
surface and a glitter of silver at the
throat, and Barbara Carson was all in
green. Among others present were Dr.
and Mrs. James Buchanan, the Byram
Gowans pnd the R. W. Stringers.
Among the many travellers who will
spend their Christmas this year at sea
is Mrs. J. H. Bruche. Here she is wear-
ing the small hat and brief veil in which
she faced a Spencer Shier camera. Mrs.
Bruche’s destination is India, where she
will visit her daughter, Mrs. R. H. Law-
rence, who is the wife of the Assistant-
Military Adviser at Baroda. Major-
General Bruche is Chief of the General
Staff and First Military Member.
At the Lucius Conollys’ party best
wishes for Christmas and New Year were
mixed with God-speeds for a holiday
in glamorous Asia. The incentive for
the cocktail-shaking was Cedric Battle,
who leaves this week to see what life
looks like in several Asiatic countries.
Mrs. Conolly was in black, her gown
patterned vaguely with coral, rust-red,
jade and powdery-blues. Mrs. Battle wore
a toilette of a type useful in the tropics ;
her frock of white crinkle-crepe was
sprigged with a decorative black design,
and her hat was large, white and the
possessor of three green buttons upon its
bandeau.
The barelegged tennis girl is some
year£ old, but Mrs. E. J. Howe set a new
fashion at the Albert Ground by turn-
ing out to play with bare feet. The
lady’s action was due to the slippery
condition of the court; but, if the vogue
is found to improve agility and make for
comfort, bare feet may become as popu-
lar as bare legs.
Mr. and Mrs. Philip Hordern, of
Kalkadoon station (Q.), are honeymoon-
ing in Melbourne ; their marriage took
place on November 1 at Winton (Q.).
In honor of the visitors a late-afternoon
party was given by the Arthur Horderns
at No. 9. The hostess wore a loosely-
swinging coat of pigeon-grey over her
pale-grey and white chiffon dress, and
her daughter-in-law chose a nectarine-
shaded coat over a gown of similar ton-
ings mixed with white. Gladioli reared
proud, vivid heads on firm stalks, masses
of phlox, peonies, roses and cornflowers
made georgeous spurts of color in the
reception-rooms, and pink and red car-
nations glowed among iced drinks and
savory bites upon the tables. Among
the guests were Mr. and Mrs. Norman
Macgeorge, the Peter Manifolds, the
Alan Robinsons and Dr. and Mrs. John
Shaw, she countering the unexpected up-
ward leap of the mercury with a cool
white crepe frock elaborated with cut-
work embroideries.
Hats may come and go ; so may dia-
dems, floral wreaths and jewelled clips ;
but Margery Stephens likes her Alice-in-
Wonderland comb best of all, and even
wears it under her hat. Miss Stephens
leaves on New Year’s Day for her first
trip abroad. In Cairo she will join Mrs.
R. G. Casey, and afterwards go on to
London and Paris. She won’t be at a
loss in France, for her French is fluent,
although it was learnt in Australia. Mar-
gery is the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Douglas Stephens, of South Yarra. Broo-
thorn portrait.
It was a strange feeling watching the
centenary championship tennis from the
tiered stand at Kooyong which just 14
days before was submerged by flood-
waters up to within a few feet of its top-
most row of seats. The pleated shorts
worn by Dorpthy Round are unani-
mously declared the garment of the
future for feminine tennis-players—they
are neat, practical and feminine. Mrs.
Malcolm (of South Africa) sticks to short
pique frocks, wears an eyeshade and
keeps her well-groomed head tidy with
a hairnet. Most of the women players
have these nets, which are a decided help
to neatness. Among other attractive
figures seen lately on the courts were the
Stevenson lasses, who got as far as the
women’s semi-finals, Nancy Wynne, in
her pleated linen shorts (she defeated
Thelma Coyne in the finals of the girls’
singles), and May Blick, who played in
linen frocks. Throughout the tourna-
ments stockings were a rarity on femi-
nine legs.
Lads in the final of the junior doubles
squelched about on bare feet at the
Albert Ground. The four who slipped
and skidded, got very wet and took back
to their digs togs which looked more like
football than tennis were J. Bromwich
and A. Huxley and their defeated oppo-
nents J. Gilchrist and C. Long.
Though the finalists in the veterans’
doubles had no gallery (except for a few
feminine spectators who may have been
wives) they seemed to enjoy themselves
enormously. They played at the Albert
Ground after everybody had rushed off
to Kooyong to see the present-day cham-
pions. One man wore trousers that kept
slipping. After continuous hitching up
throughout one set, his partner came to
the rescue by boring a hole with a pen-
knife in the non-fitting belt. Another
plumpish gentleman experienced diffi-
culty with his breathing, for after every
dash up to the net he had a short spell
leaning on his racquet. The sporting
spirit was bubbling over, for after every
specially good shot at least three players
held up the game to clap heartily. The
“old ’uns” who, though they are not
much good at running, are full of court
craft were C. Calder and C. J. Pawsey,
successful, and J. J. Feeny and D. Fran-
kenberg, defeated.
Very severe was the wedding head-
dress worn by Mary Whitehead. It was
a nunlike creation of white satin which
came under the chin and covered all the
hair round the front of the face and
most of the forehead. From narrow
bands of satin over the top of the head
a tulle veil fell in a misty suggestion over
the plain sheath of satin gown. Gerald
William Austin, son of the A. W. Austins,
of Narrandera (N.S.W.), waited at St.
John’s, Toorak, for the bride, who is the
second daughter of Mr. and Mrs. G. H.
Whitehead, Goodwood, Minhamite. A
trio of ’maids, bride’s sister June, ’groom’s
sister Joan and Janet Ramsay, attended
in a rustle of taffetas, with wreath's of
green leaves in their hair and a pair of
gardenias secured behind one ear. The
ceremony took place in the evening, and
continued with rejoicings in the ballroom
at No. 9.
Speaking of “Avalanche,” one of his
plays published in “Failures,” Beverley
Nichols says, “... .and so it has petered
out, although it occasionally flits across
the boards of tiny remote theatres in
England and the Continent.” Little old
St. Chad’s, tucked away in a cobbled lane
of South Yarra, comes under the cate-
gory of tiny remote theatres. “Ava-
lanche,” which was favorably received in
a diminutive building for four nights last
week, was an interesting performance,
for it makes one wonder what it is
exactly that causes a play to “get over.”
David Reid wears a bloodcurdling scarlet
shirt when as Nigel, the young dramat-
ist, he makes his house party (snow-
bound, with neither telephone nor radio
and only creme de men the to drink) be-
lieve that a war has broken out between
England and America. Irene Mitchell is
amusing as an idiotic and titled English-
woman ; she begs Nigel to join the army
for “social advantages.” Pompous Lord
Rockstone (Robert Bennett, with a white
moustache) advises enlistment because
Nigel, as his prospective son-in-law, will
be a cog in the wheel of British indus-
try. As Nigel’s promised love, Enid Hol-
lins is soulful first of all in black velvet,
next in cherry velvet and last in tweeds.
Ella Bromley wears baby-pink and a
little white fur cape in which to be loyal
to the enemy American (Wilbur Reed).
Murray Matheson is the impetuous
young Englishman who dashes off into
the snow to enlist in an imaginary army
and breaks his neck.
Before he died 10 years ago Peter
Stuckey Mitchell displayed his confi-
dence in physical fitness when balanced
with religion, education and good gen-
eral knowledge. He left an estate valued
at a quarter of a million, most of which,
after provision has been made for his
widow, is to go to the promotion of phy-
sical perfection in the Australian race.
Annual prizes each year are to be given
to the 15 fittest young women and the
10 fittest young men in the Common-
wealth. It’s not merely a beauty con-
test, for competitors must be British sub-
jects, free from hereditary diseases and
not the offspring of cousins. They must
be able to ride and swim, and the lads
must be good shots and have fulfilled
their military duties (if any). Competi-
tors must have a general knowledge of
the Empire and English literature, Aus-
tralian geography, anatomy and hygiene,
and they must have cultivated an appre-
ciation of the English Bible. The
young women should be of cheerful dis-
position, with a knowledge of first aid,
and should be hopeful of some day be-
coming mothers of healthy babies. Delay
in the administration of Bringenbrong
estate has so far hindered the execution
of this portion of the will, but the
trustees are making the necessary appli-
cation.

BY APPOINTMENT TO H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Mrs. J. D. Grace and her daughter
Audrey were hostesses at a farewell party
for Mrs. E. M. Priest and daughters
Marjorie and Betty, who are to have a
trip to the U.S.A. Bridge was played in
the spacious ballroom at the South Aus-
tralian and tea was served in the lounge,
where delphiniums, gladioli and roses
decorated. Mrs. Grace wore a pale-
grey marocain ensemble with a hat to
match. Miss Grace chose a red crepe
coat and skirt with a smart red hat'. Mrs.
Priest’s black-and-white-figured crepe de
Chine was associated with a black silk
three-quarter coat and a black straw hat.
Marjorie Priest was in pale pink crepe,
and her sister sported black windswept
crepe.
Travis Webber’s show of paintings was
opened by Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson.
Webber was first' a pupil of James Ash-
ton and afterwards studied in Sydney
under Dattilo Rubbo and Jackson. He
is showing some delightful landscapes.
The Viennese Cabaret at the Uni.,
although a success financially, had the
wrong sort of weather. The layout of
little tables all around the cloisters in the
open, illumined by Chinese lanterns and
fairy lights, was most effective, but the
cold night made the refectory more
popular than dancing on the lawn. The
students serving refreshments wore
Viennese costumes. His Ex. and Lady
Dugan with their suite were received by
Dr. and Mrs. Rex Matters. Lady Dugan
wore black, lace with a touch of pink in
a floral spray. Mrs. Matters chose
Madonna-blue crepe with silver lame
lining the cape effect.
The Operatic Society put on a suc-
cessful week’s run of “Little Nellie
Kelly” at the Tiv. in aid of charities. The
Uni. Footlights Club followed with a
variety show for three nights, winning
vice-regal patronage on the last night.
The funniest item was “Eastern Nights,”
featuring Rex Dawe as the Shah and
John Duncan as the Star of the Harem.
Premier Butler and his son-in-law Neil
McEwin are off to Kangaroo Island for
the Christmas holidays. Mrs. Butler has
taken a house at Glenelg, and will have
her daughters, Jean and Mrs. Neil
McEwin, with her.
WESTRALIA.
With the approach of Yuletide social
workers have been turning their thoughts
to children’s parties. The St. George’s
College affair was a garden-party, with
Knight Talbot Hobbs and his lady offici-
ally receiving the young guests. Arch-
bishop Le Fanu and Warden Law flanked
milady’s malt-bread floral marocain with
its shading of burnt-crust ballibuntal.
Three to four hundred party frocks or
fancy costumes disported on the grassy
quadrangle. The Y.A.L. band piped
lustily. Proceeds to the Swan Boys’
Orphanage.
The Mission to Seamen collected the
shekels which poured in for the child-
ren’s jamboree at Fremantle when the
Strathaird was put at the disposal of
the committee by the P. and O. Co.
Captains Carter and Edwards steered the
v.-r. party through the sea of balloons
round the decks and navigated a passage
by the tables of bridge-players in the
lounges and winter gardens. The wee
visitors rushed from Punch and Judy,
Aunt Sally and the slippery dip to watch
the conjurer and June Irvine’s ballets,
then did a tour of the various stalls and
cooled off at the swimming-pool.
Military men ushered in the Christ-
mas season with battalion officers’
dances. The 44th invited fair partners
to the Subiaco Drill Hall, where an array
of trophies was grouped at one end of
the room, with the R.S.L. efficiency
trophy in central position. This figure
of a soldier in uniform, carved in wood
by General Jess, and cast in bronze,
was presented during the evening by
president Yates. Col. Foxworthy took
the salute with his lady’s black taffetas
abloom with roses alongside. Betty Grif-
fiths Bowen was armed with layers of
Mary-blue silk net; Mrs. H. B. Hatten’s
silver lame decorations were worn on
moon-blue velvet; and Mrs. Meredith’s
marocains caught* the colors of the rising
sun.
Officers of the 28th camped at Anzac
House for their Christmas dancing
manoeuvres. Supper-tables were arranged
rakewise at one end of the hall, with the
C. 0., Major Wilson, and his lady’s black
chiffon velvets at the handle; Mrs.
A. M. Martyn’s Patou-pink marocains
were next her Brigadier-General’s red
coat; and to the left Major Anketell
supported his better half’s pink matt
crepe with its epaulettes of silver and
halter of metal rings. Mrs. Jack Durack’s
laces were in rich earthy brown ; Mrs.
Brendon Garner was tiered with leaf-
green georgette; and the sisters Prisk,
Barbara and Margaret, chose respectively
blue and green floral marquisette.
Winsome Bettesworth and Eric Booth
paddled their matrimonial canoe from
St. George’s Cathedral with a blessing
from the Dean of Perth. Globules of
embossing bubbled over the silvery pool
of bridal peau d’ange, and the mist of
a floating tulle veil hung from a scin-
tillating diamente bandeau clouding her
sheaf of silver leaves. A trio of brides-
maids came in the wake, with Mavis
Bettesworth’s trained lettuce-green sheer
crepe and silk mohair hat to the fore,
and Lorna Booth and Phyllis Barry aft.
Their ivory satins were hand-painted in
gold and green to match their trans-
parent green pancake berets.
For her marriage to Dr. Arthur Merritt
at St. Mary’s, West Perth, the only splash
of color on the driven snow of Freda
Scanlon’s outfit was the sheaf of
maiden’s-blush gladioli. Her clinging
white satin was self-striped; two
camellias appeared on her bodice, a
single bloom grew in her white hat and
a ruching of satin softened the line
around her throat. Attendant Ina Mer-
ritt’s white cotelle with its unusual flared
sleeves was swathed with satin and
lined with green to match the wreath of
celluloid flowers encircling her white
straw hat.
TASMANIA.
We, too, have had a centenary celebra-
tion, and a great day it was for the dis-
trict which has St. Helen’s, that pretty
little treeful town, for its centre. A hun-
dred years ago the site of St. Helen’s was
virgin bush. Unfortunately rain rather
damaged the effect of some of the sport-
ing events, and his Ex. and Lady Clark
had to hurriedly return to Hobart, as she
was indisposed. Many descendants of
the first pioneers are still living in the
district.
Hobart and Commonwealth are the
poorer for the passing of Dr. Eric Jef-
frey, still in his forties, and, although
almost completely crippled by rheuma-
tism, a powerful influence in the com-
munity. Readers of The Bulletin will
remember him as “Exul.” His Sandford
Jackson lecture in Brisbane a few months
ago and his broadcast talks on medical
subjects were greatly admired. He was
the Tas. representative of the Australian
“Medical Journal,” among many other
activities.
“Ten Minute Alibi” was chosen as the
Hobart Rep. Soc.’s latest effort, and
though the producer, Olive Wilton, was
laid up, it ran with success for three
nights. J. D. Bushby (a new member),
Mary Harbottle and Jack Mitchell took
the principal parts well.
Midland folk have been entertaining
pretty Joan Oldrey, whose marriage to
Prof. McAulay comes off this month.
Hostesses included Mrs. John Taylor,
Mrs. Athol Nicolson and Mrs. G. W.
Keach.
The Lyceum Literary Circle wound up
its operations for the year at the club,
and portmanteaued the occasion with a
farewell to Miss McDonald, who has
gone from the Speck to her own home in
Brisbane after finishing her secretarial
job at' Government House.
Dr. Christine Walch was guest of honor
at a party given by the A.W.N.L. at its
rooms in Liverpool-street'. Decorations
were gay and charming, and Dr. Walch
gave a short account of her travels.
Handsome and popular Mary John-
son, of Launceston (Mrs. Landon Fair-
thorne’s daughter), was made life-partner
of Lieut. Curt Wennberg, A.D.C. to
Prince Charles of Sweden, at the State
Bureau,- Berlin. Ishbel Hogg attended
the bride, and the only others present
were Prince Charles and the bride’s uncle,
Dr. Rohde. The wedding-dress of heavy
white satin had an unusually long train,
and the tulle veil fell from a little cap
of orange-blossom. Miss Hogg ’maided
in pink satin.
Felicity Syme (Melb.), engaged to Peter
Clemons (Launceston), has been visiting
the Speck and meeting her prospective
husband’s family and friends.
Very genuine regret is felt throughout
the Speck at the news of the death of
our former Governor, Sir James
O’Grady. He steered a tactful course in
the midst of difficulties, and always
showed a keen sense of his responsi-
bilities.

The Flea and the Emperor.
Ha, ha, ha! I bit the old emperor.
I nibbled his rump,
Then hop, skip and jump
To the small of his back
For a succulent snack.
Whack !
Ha, ha, ha! The pompous old monarch
Is smacking his hip
Wherever l nip.
Then he claws at his knee
After one little flea:
Me !
Ha, ha, ha! He nearly entrapped me,
Just having a doze
In warm underclothes.
Not as safe as I thought;
It’s a dangerous sport.
Caught!
Ha, ha, ha! His thumb and forefinger
Are too round and fat
To kill me like that.
So I just wriggle free
And with infinite glee
Flee !

Is Good
Opera
Bad Art?
M ontague
Grover objects to
grand opera (B.
14/11 /’34). He
says that grand
opera is taken
seriously by people who ought to know
better.
It seems to me that Mr. Grover is
arrogating to himself a
right to judge the behavior
of a large number of people
of quite considerable artis-
tic eminence who are gen-
erally regarded as having
added something significant
to the world’s store of
beauty and truth. Since the
people who have written
opera apparently thought
they were doing something
serious, and not merely
passing the time between
the cradle and the grave as
flippantly as possible, Mr.
Grover is condemning Beet-
hoven, Berlioz, Verdi,
Moussorgsky, Tschaikow-
sgy, Offenbach, Stravinsky,
Rossini, Rubinstein, Mas-
senet, Puccini and approxi-
mately 250 other capable
composers as being guilty
of unpardonable frivolity;
or,!if not of frivolity, of being entirely mis-
taken about the nature of their art and the
limitations of their medium. Moreover,
there are competent musicians who, ac-
cording to Mr. Grover’s theory, are en-
gaged at the present moment in perpe-
trating artistic tomfoolery, since they
still persist in writing opera.
If such a large number of people of
unquestionable talent and high intelli-
gence are doing certain things they must
have good reasons for doing so, even if
Mr. Grover and I don’t know quite what
those reasons are —anyhow, we usually
judge by their results. It seems to me
that they are all talking a particular lan-
guage, and unless we are able to speak
that language too we will be unable to
know what they are talking about.
There is the language of the physicist,
like Rutherford, and there is the language
of the philosopher, like Bertrand Rus-
sell, and the language of the landscape
painter, like Max Meldrum, and the lan-
guage of the psychologist, like James
Joyce. Until we are in the position to
talk their language as well as they do
themselves, I fancy we are much in the
position of the person who does not
know French when he hears a French-
man speak it—he may dislike the French-
man, and he may not like the sound of
his speech or the look of his face, but
he will be quite unable to say whether
the Frenchman speaks French well or ill
or whether what he says is sensible or
not or good or wicked.
Grand opera, it seems to me, is simply
a sort of language in which certain
talented persons have attempted from
time to time to couch their thoughts.
Some of them spoke the language well
and some spoke it ill. According to
the experts, some of the Italians spoke
it very ill indeed, and these are the ones
who appear to be most popular. But
some of them spoke it almost as well
as it could be spoken ; and among these,
according to the experts and, inciden-
tally, also according to Mr. Grover,
Wagner stands supreme.
Wagner understood the language
better than anyone else, and towards the
end of his career spoke it, they say, with
staggering facility. It is said that some
of the things he said are of quite death-
less beauty, such as “The Valkyrie” and
“Tristan and Isolde.” These two have
lately been presented in Melbourne by
Ben Fuller per medium of Florence Aus-
tral, Norman Allin, Walter Widdop,
Horace Stevens, Muriel Brunskill and
others, who, I understand, are very com-
petent vocalists; of Maurice de Abra-
vanel and his Australian orchestra, who,
I am told, are pretty good at their job ;
and of Charles Moor, who, I am led
to believe, is a crafty fellow in the realm
of stage production. So Mr. Grover and
the rest of us have had an excellent op-
portunity of judging, if we can, whether
Herr Wagner knew what he was doing.
Well, I went to see these grand operas
or musical dramas which Mr. Grover
says are bad art, and I confess that I
completely succumbed to them. The
fact that I succumbed to them has no
significance, of course, but I tried to
understand what Wagner was trying to
do. It seemed to me that Wagner was
a man with a talent for expressing his
thoughts in the form of beautiful sounds,
a talent which is utterly mysterious to
those who have it not, and which is akin
to the talent of the architect who con-
“The Wharves of Sydney,” pencil painting by Lloyd Rees at Macquarie Galleries, Sydney.
templates nature and makes a cathedral
which is not like anything definite in
nature at all, and yet we know it to be
beautiful and true. But Wagner was
interested, too, in the metaphysical and
philosophical ideas of his day, and in
the nature of society and in the way men
behave. He was also interested in the
ancient Nordic lore and mythology, and
he drew from them majestic symbols for
the majestic thoughts that were in his
mind. He was also a man of extra-
ordinary dramatic, as well as musical,
talent. His contemplation of life pro-
duced in him an astounding variety both
of dramatic and musical ideas, and he
felt that he would never say what he
wanted to say to his own satisfaction
unless he cast it into what one might
call bilingual form. So he wrote a
number of works in which he endeav-
ored to blend the two mediums, and he
succeeded better than anybody had suc-
ceeded before. He succeeded so well
that even Austral’s waving of Isolde’s
scarf seemed musical. He made the
barnyard virility of the proceedings in
“The Valkyrie” seem musical, too ; and
he made the music of both the plays
seem dramatic and emotional as well,
If we refuse to grant Wagner the righ’t
to speak his own language in the way
he thinks most fit, the whole business, of
course, can appear ridiculous, for young
heroines have often to be represented by
prima donnas whose painstaking en-
deavors to sing Wagner aright maketh
them exceedingly fat; and gods are often
represented by bass-baritones with boots
that squeak ; but the conventions of ordi-
nary stage drama present spectacles
equally incongruous, and we put up with
it. The question that matters is whether
Wagner speaks his language well or ill
or whether it is a language at all. The
people who say it isn’t are under an
obligation to explain how he should have
said it and prescribe the proper tongue.
F. S.
Artists and
Morals
H. L. Lindsay,
who championed
Kipling (R. P.
14/11/ ’34) as the
model Great Art-
ist, need not
shiver over the horrible example nasty
minds set for the world. The G.P., even
to-day, knows nothing of the great artist
in its midst, and cares less. Probably
the only G. Mind it knows of is Shaw,
and of him—that he is a nut-eater and
a pantomimic Communist and maker of
vast sums of money. If every G.A. in
Europe led a private life that would make
a monkey sick it would not affect the
average man any more than if Einstein
turned teacup reader.
I hold no brief for abnormality, yet
it is possible to see abnormality as part
of the force that drives the artist to
create. Nature has no concern for the
conventions man imposes on her; the
artist is like Nature. He is there to inter-
pret life through his experience, and this
is not usually what his neighbor considers
clean and wholesome. It is a happy pic-
ture, the artist as good father, fine citizen
and sharp businessman—the American
literary dream brought up. to date. But
unfortunately, to the G.A. it is death.
Respectabilities are modes of thought
and behavior imposed by custom ; the
artist, if he is to endure, must pass beyond
these. His lecheries, his drunkenness,
his bawdyism are usually, if one delves
deeply enough to understand, only a piti-
ful defiance to the world, in which he
knows he stands isolated. Out of him-
self he draws the whole of life. He goes
through years of mental torture before
he reaches the stage of the great artist;
he must work like a nigger, and usually
alone; half the time he is paid less than
a coolie ; he is open to insult and con-
tempt. While he wrestles and sweats,
the clean and wholesome writer v/axes
fat and basks like an overblown toad.
If he says more than boo to a goose he
is liable to be nabbed by the police. Ab-
normally sensitive, he sees about him the
horror of a world where one laugh has
its million attendant groans, so in despair
he seeks to escape in his own way.
Beauty and creation carry their own
seeds of destruction. Yet he is expected
to live like the businessman, whose
imagination probably never functions
from the time he plays pirates to the
day he dies.
Anyway, the artist lives or dies by his
work. If he is great it must not be con-
cerned with moral standards, and what
he writes has nothing to do with what
he is. If Shakspeare tippled too much
or deserted his wife that does not affect
what he has written. The good citizen
has withstood thousands of years of these
wicked literary geniuses—he can well
afford to stand a few thousand more.

The Painter-
Etchers’ and
Cranhic Art Soc
latest form of
was the
Painter Ftchers’
Soc., has a show all in monochrome
at the Education Department’s gal-
leries, Sydney, comprising etchings,
aquatints and mezzotints, and pencil,
water-color and pen-drawings. Almost
all are by Australian artists, exceptions
being the etchings of Charles W. Cain,
a remarkably accomplished draughtsman
whose work has been accepted by the
R.A., and a few examples of the work
of Academicians Malcolm Osborne and
Sir Frank Short. Also there are some
dainty bookplates of Sir Nevile Wilkin-
son. The Australians are such an even
lot that only the boldest designs impress
themselves on the eye in a saunter round
the walls. One of the finest things in the
show is Cedric Emanuel’s pen-study for
an etching—a waterside scene that shows
perfect mastery of black-and-white tech-
nique. Emanuel’s etchings are not quite
up to that promise, but they stand out,
as do also the coarse-grained charcoal-
effect etchings of Max Ragless. J. S.
Watkins has limned some graceful nudes
in pencil, Bulletin contributors Miller
and Townshend are represented by char-
acteristic offerings, and Sheila Macdonald
in a blue etching gets as much of moon-
light as was ever packed into two dimen-
sions. Standard of drawing, taken all
round, is fairly high, but there are not
a few spires out of plumb and buildings
whose perspective doesn’t carry convic-
tion. Frank E. Johnstone escapes these
strictures. His picture of the Grace
Building in Sydney is perfectly perpen-
dicular.
George Colville exhibits at Hogan’s
Gallery, Melbourne, 25 oil-paintings, all
landscapes of scenery on the outskirts
of the city. Most striking are “Fisher-
man’s Bend,” “In the Storm” and “On
the Ballarat Road.”
Sydney and Melbourne provided the
scenes about equally for the pictures
which Aileen Dent exhibited at the
Lyceum Club, Melbourne, and Sydney
gained the honors. Cremcyne, the
familiar but ever-interesting panorama cf
the point from Musgrave-street, is pos-
sibly the best of the collection ; a Bridge
painting, showing the dome of steel
dominating the harbor through the haze
of early morning, runs it a close second.
There are three or four portraits and
seven water-colors.
The magic pencil of Lloyd Rees has
been at work on 36 pieces of white paper
that hang in frames in the Macquarie
Galleries, Sydney, and has endowed them
with the qualities of water, rock, sand,
atmosphere and foliage. He makes a per-
fectly accurate transcript (his draughts-
manship, architectural and otherwise, is
unerring) of Sydney’s jumbled cityscape
and it looks as romantic as Bagdad. He
has so lovingly studied the Sydney sand-
stone and the texture and tint of the
sand derived from its attri-
tion that he can reproduce
their essence in the space
of half a postage stamp.
His is the impressionism
that gives the etfect of
microscopic detail by going
to the root of the matter
presented.
Vincent Sheldon, who is
represented in the British
Museum and in the Victoria
and Albert Museum, held
an exhibition of paintings,
pencil sketches and dry-
points at the Gainsborough
Gallery, Brisbane. That the
artist’s color sense has de-
veloped considerably of late
is evidenced in a group of
three water-colors, delight-
ful things in subdued tones,
with a hint of mist. Among
the dry points, “Sideshows”
is a fine bit of work de-
picting a canvas town, with showmen
yelling before the tents and groups of
the various “attractions” exhibiting their
charms to the public. One of the most
interesting pictures in the exhibition is
“Shades of the Past,” in which old St.
Stephen’s, with the green which once bor-
dered it, is shown, with a group of people
j n t h e costumes of the ’sixties outside
the old church. The artist has repro-
duced not only the costumes but the
treatment of the earlier period. In the
three oils the artist departs from the deli-
cacy of the water-colors and pencil
sketches, and strikes some rich color
notes. Bits of bygone Brisbane, notably
the old arch which once beautified the
Ann-street entrance to the Brisbane Cen-
tral station but has been removed in the
name of progress, have been honored in
the pencil sketches.
To the general public, Stephanie
Taylor is probably better known than
any other Vic. artist, for her broadcast
talks on artistic subjects go into every
home, her lectures at the National Gal-
lery attract scores weekly and her literary
output is well read. Miss Taylor is now
holding an exhibition of her own at
Everyman’s Library Melbourne. Pnn-
c j p£d amo ng the exhibits are fan deco-
rations, of which there are 14, all dainty
and co lorful. Of her oil-paintings,
“Q u i nces ” and “Chrysanthemums” are
tb e most SUCC essful. She has aimed at a
low _ toned , old-masterish effect, and suc-
f well other exhibits com-
prjse work j n p as tel, etching and water-
color with one lone miniature to give an
atmosphere to the
show.

Humor Story Entry:-
BENEATH THEIR
SKINS.
BY HARRY PAULL.
DRAWINGS BY SCORFIELD.
THE police sergeant muttered an im-
precation. This was the most ex-
traordinary affair he had encoun-
tered. It seemed incredible, yet there it
was, set down precisely in Senior-con-
stable Dane’s thick handwriting. The
sergeant ordered Brewer’s presence
immediately.
When Constable Joseph Brewer stood
to attention before him the sergeant in-
spected him critically. Brewer was a
young man of phlegmatic character. At
the present moment, however, his face
was red and his lip was twitching emo-
tionally. The sergeant, thrusting specu-
lation aside, sat straight in his chair and
cleared his throat.
“You know why you’re here, Brewer,”
he said decisively. “I don’t intend to
read out your senior’s detailed report
concerning you. You were in Curtain-
street at about 12.45 a.m. In your
right hand you held a ukulele, while your
left arm held a five-pound note and en-
circled the body of a young woman clad
in a dark overcoat and pink or orange
pyjamas. At the moment of the senior’s
arrival you were excitedly, kissing the
young woman. Is that all correct?”
“Yes, sergeant.”
“The senior reports that you were per-
fectly sober.”
“I never drink, sergeant.”
“So I’ve always believed. You could
not explain your conduct to the senior.”
“I could have explained,” said Brewer
miserably, “but I was so upset about
everything that my mind
wouldn’t work.”
“Can you explain
now?” asked the ser-
geant. “As a matter of
fact, if you can’t I shall
have to take steps to
bring about your dis-
missal from the force.
We can’t keep a man
who, when supposedly
on his beat, is found
clutching a ukulele, a
fiver and an amorous
woman.”
“Sergeant,” said
Brewer, mopping his
brow, “I’m going to tell
you everything.”
“Do! ” said the ser-
geant'. “Stand easy and
spit it out. Until last night I had a good
opinion of you. You’ve never shown
brilliancy, Brewer, but I had marked you
out as a reliable, conscientious man.”
“...into my arms.”
“Thank you, sergeant. It wasn’t me ;
it was circumstances. Last night was
fine, but there was no moon. As I
patrolled my beat I came from heavy
shadows into those little circles of light
thrown by the street lamps, then into
shadows again. As I walked along Cur-
tain-street I was rapt in thought—though
my eyes and ears were open, as I’m al-
ways mindful of my duty. But I am
young, and I can tell you confidentially,
sergeant, that I’m in love. If you’ve ever
been in love you’ll know that I”
“Is this a love story, Brewer, or a re-
port?” asked the sergeant irritably.
“A report, ser-
geant. But each
night, just about
midnight, if I’m a
few minutes early
for the meeting
with my senior at
the next intersec-
tion, I’ve got into
the way of pausing
near the Eureka
flats, which is that
big four-storeyed
block of concrete
in Curtain-street. It
was my habit to
commune with my
soul, as it is called.
Where the shadows
are blackest, while
keeping my eyes
skinned, I pon-
dered on the misery
of a hopeless love. I have to confess, in
confidence, sergeant, that I had loved in
vain. My girl wouldn’t have me. ‘Oh,
yeah?’ she’d say to me, being modern.
‘Marry a stodgy, stick-in-the-mud old
policeman? Not me, I don’t!’ As for
stodgy, stick-in-the-mud, sergeant, a girl
can’t expect a conscientious policeman to
do the Highland fling in the street; and
that I’m not old she well
knew, that being just a
manner of speech”
THE sergeant thumped
the table excitedly.
“For God’s sake, Brewer,
don’t exasperate me!
Get on with what hap-
pened last night!”
“Yes, sergeant.- Last
night I’d come to those
shadows when I observed
a human figure standing
against the ornamental
concrete fence which is
in front of the Eureka
flats. There’s a street
lamp opposite, and this
figure was just beyond
the light thrown down
by the lamp. I gripped my baton and
approached, ready for any funny busi-
ness.
“ ‘What are you doing here?’ I asked.
“ ‘You haven’t got the nerve.’"
“ ‘Everything is 0.K., constable,’ came
the response, very pleasant.
“Then I saw that the voice came from
a youngish fellow in an overcoat and
a dinner jacket. ‘Everything is not O.K.
till I say so,’ I said. Noticing then that
he was carrying something which was
like a leg of mutton, I added: ‘What’s
that you’re carrying?”
“ ‘lt’s a ukulele, constable,’ he said.
“ ‘Then it’s up to you,’ said I, ‘to tell
me what you’re doing with a ukulele on
the street at about 12.30 a.m.’
“ ‘l’m not doing anything with it,’ he
answered, quite friendly ; ‘but I was just
about to strum it while I sang a serenade.’
“‘A serenade,’ I said, ‘is what those
gondolas in Italy play to their hulas on
balconies, and respectable Australian
citizens don’t do those things.’
“ ‘No!’ he said, ‘they don’t; and that’s
really why I’m here.’
“ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘it’s obvious to me that
you’ve been to a beano and you’re
sprung. What’s your name and where do
you live?’
“ T live at a hotel in the city,’ said
he, ‘and my name is Brian Munro. I’m
an aviator, and I’m horribly sober.’
“I looked hard at his face, sergeant,
and blowed if I didn’t recognise him
from photos. I’d seen in the papers. ‘You
flew from England
and just missed the
record by seven
hours,’ I said. ‘I
recognise you, Mr.
Munro.’
“ ‘That’s me,’ he
said. ‘But I’ll break
that record next
time.’
“ ‘I hope you do.
Now off you get to
your hotel,’ I said
kindly ; ‘and I hope
you find a taxi, or
you’ll have a four-
mile walk.’
«DUT he didn’t
® go, sergeant,
and I could see
now that he was
quite sober. ‘Con-
stable! ’ he said, ‘l’m mighty glad you’ve
recognised me and haven’t any sus-
picions left. I can talk plainly now as
man to man. Tell me, if I strum my
ukulele and sing a serenade, is that an
offence against the law?’
“Well, that had me puzzled, sergeant.
‘lf you obstruct the traffic it is an
offence,’ I said. ‘lt is also an offence if
you create a disturbance or become a
nuisance to citizens or ask for alms.’
“ ‘Constable,’ he whispered, ‘have you
ever been in love?’
“‘Love?’ I said. ‘When you mention
love I can answer at once. I have been
in love, Mr. Munro, and I’m in love this
very minute.’ For as I was saying, ser-
geant, whenever I get a little spell near
those Eureka flats I get to thinking how
hard it is to please a girl. You tell her
you love her and she says ‘Oh yeah?’
which isn’t good English. You tell her
you’d die for her, and”
“Damn! ” roared the sergeant. “I
don’t tell women anything! Get on
with your report!”
“Yes, sergeant. ‘Well,’ says Mr. Munro,
‘l’m going to tell you everything as an
understanding man and a fellow-suf-
ferer. You see those flats?’
“ ‘I see them three times every night,’
I said.
“ ‘On the second floor,’ he said, ‘there
is a flat occupied by a lady who has a
beautiful voice and is one of Melbourne’s
most promising young singers. Her eyes
are deep violet, and marvellous little
lights play about in their depths like
fairies. She has a mouth which reminds
one of’
“ ‘Who lives on the second floor of
the Eureka flats don’t interest me,’ I
interrupted.
“ ‘No, I suppose it don’t,’ he answered.
‘Other fellows tell me that. However,
this evening,
con stable, I
contracted to
sing Schubert’s
“Serena de”
under her
window, she
having cast a
doubt as to
my moral
courage which
cons iderably
annoyed me.’
“ ‘lt seems
to me,’ I said,
‘that making a
gondola out of
you r s elf is
“ ‘Till I call thee
mine’”
only making yourself ridiculous for
nothing.’
“‘Not for nothing!’ he answered
quickly. ‘Why, if a red rose is thrown
from her window to this footpath that
means she’ll be my wife.’
“ ‘Better if you went up to her like a
man to a woman instead of a gondola
to a hula,’ I said ‘and asked her to
marry you.’
“ ‘Women are queer creatures,’ he said,
and I agreed with him on that point, and
I wasn’t ashamed to admit it. ‘Con-
stable,’ he went on, ‘I have already
politely asked her. She just sighed and
said that she’d very much like to, but it
all seemed so disappointingly common-
place, like purchasing something of a
store ; and she ended by saying no. Then,
getting sarcastic, constable, I suggested
that maybe she’d like me to fall on my
knees, or, better still, go around and
serenade her under her window when all
the world was asleep. “You haven’t got
the nerve to do it,” she said, laughing
outright at me ; upon which I completely
lost my head and cried: “I’ll do it! And
if you’ll throw that red rose you’re wear-
ing now down to me I’ll know it is yes.”
She said she believed I was silly enough
to do it after all. In which case I
needn’t bother. She said to propose
again, just ordinary-like. “By God!” I
said. “I shall not! I’ll show you! This
very night I’ll sing Schubert’s ‘Serenade’
beneath your window! ” That’s how ob-
stinate I am, constable. She saw I meant
it She went very pale, but said nothing
more, and I left in a huff.. And here I
am, constable, and 1 wish I were flying

BACKACHE
WHY ENDURE THIS AGONY WHEN A SURE,
SIMPLE AND SAFE REMEDY IS AT HAND
When yon reach the stage where pain compels
you to say “ I must get rid of this backache 1 ”
you will commence taking De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills, and then, in a very short time, your
pain will disappear.
Naturally it would be better if you took De Witt’s
Pills as soon as
THE FIRST STAB OF PAIN
came to warn you, but many people make the same
mistake. They do not realise the serious nature of
Backache and so they wait, hoping the pain will
go away, or try various methods of treatment
which may give temporary relief. This cannot go
on for long. Soon the time comes when backache
compels you to neglect or give up your work. Life
is a mockery when you are always in pain, but
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills will drive the
pain away and they will also protect you against
future attacks.
Read how successful De Witt’s Pills proved in
Mrs. Edmiston’s case and perhaps her experience
will persuade you to give them a trial.
Writing from “Gwen Villa,” William Street,
South Brisbane, Mrs. A. Edmiston says :
“ I used to suffer terribly with backache and,
although l tried one thing after another, l
could not get lasting relief. The pain got
worse and worse until a friend induced me to
try De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills. These
gave me ease at once. A nyone who has suffered
as / have will understand how grateful lam.”
A point you will appreciate abont De Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills is the fact that they give
almost instant relief. You may have endured agony
all day and you feel that unless you get rid of the
pain you will not be able to endure another day.
Put your faith in De Witt’s Pills. They will not
fail you. Get a box from the chemists to-day, price
3/6 and 6/6. Sold only in the white, blue and gold
boxes. Take two just before you go to bed and in
the morning your pain will be gone.
RELIEF IN 24 HOURS
A few hours after you take the first dose of
De Witt’s Pills discolouration of the urine will prove
that they have commenced their good work. You
will be able to see that the cleansing, healing
and strengthening ingredients of De Witt’s Pills
h.ave passed through your kidneys and your bladder.
No other medicine furnishes proof like this, and
once you have tried them your one regret will be
that you did not do so before. Take De Witt’s
Pills for Scalding Pains, Gravel, Stone , Painful
Joints, Stiffness, Rheumatism, Backache, .
Lumbago, Sciatica. Give them to children subject
to Bed-wetting, and to aged persons afflicted by
Urinary Disorders, and in every case they will
give prompt relief. Many thousands of suffering
men, women and children in all parts
of the world have already proved
this, but the best proof of all can
can be obtained by a
personal trial in your
own case.

your permission I’ll sing the damned
serenade, and for God’s sake don’t criti-
cise my voice, which is pretty awful.’
«CO there I stood, sergeant, unable to
think of any legal objection strong
enough to outweigh my humanity. He
gave a few preliminaries on the ukulele,
swore under his breath that he was a
bleeding idiot, and then burst forth into
his serenade.
“It was all about nature, sergeant, with
particular reference to birds, winds,
rustling leaves and brooks, with addi-
tional remarks telling how he waited,
growing impatient, until he might call
her his —which touched a chord in my
own heart. I can’t say that he did have
much of a voice, though I’ve heard
worse. I may say also, sergeant, that he
didn’t create a nuisance. I distinctly
heard two or three windows slide open,
but no lights were lit and no verbal ob-
jections were raised. And after all, ser-
geant, one suburban cat can equal all
the gondolas in Italy. ‘Till 1 call thee
mine! Till I call thee mine !’ Such were
Mr. Munro’s final words.
“All the while he had his eyes fixed on
the window of a room which I pre-
sumed was the bedroom of his young
woman. Then, suddenly, right between
him and me something fell with a light
flop like a cat springing from a fence.
Mr. Munro made a dive for it and picked
it up. Sure enough, sergeant, it was a
big rose, though its hue I couldn’t see
in the dark. ‘Mine!’ he stuttered. ‘For
ever mine! Oh, let me get away, and
walk, and walk!’ He danced and blew
kisses to the window. Then he sprang
over and thrust something into my hand.
That is how I got the note, sergeant.
Then he leapt away, but immediately
sprang back and thrust the ukulele at me.
‘lt’s no use to me,’ he said. ‘You can
pawn it for a few bob. You’re a sport,
constable.’ Then he thumped me on the
back and fled or flew, as grammar may
be. That is how I got the ukulele, ser-
geant.
“I was standing there when I thought
I’d have a look at the note to see what
value it was, hoping it was a pound and
not ten bob. So I stepped out under the
light to examine it. I own to being
pleasantly surprised when I found it was
a fiver. It was mine by right of gift, and
not a bribe, wasn’t it, sergeant?”
*<VOU haven’t ended your report yet,
* Brewer,” said the sergeant. “Am 1
to understand that Mr. Munro’s young
lady rushed out and flung herself in
your arms?”
“No, sergeant, she was Muriel. As I
meant to explain when you told me to
get on with what happened, my young
lady is a parlormaid in the flat on the
third floor; and while I was still staring
at the five-pound note, feeling real joy-
ful, I heard a soft patter behind me, and
my Muriel flung herself into my arms.
As the senior has said she wore her
greatcoat over her pyjamas. Whether
they are pink or orange I can’t say.
Woman-like, she talked all in a rush.
“ ‘Oh, my wonderful, romantic darling!
To think it was you I’ve been listening
to at my window. The first notes awoke
me. Oh, forgive me for calling you
stodgy! I didn’t know you loved me so
marvellously romantically as this! Why
didn’t you do this months ago? I’m
ready to marry you as soon as you like,
precious, and every evening you must
play and sing to your loving little wife.’
“Then she kissed me, sergeant, prop-
erly, as you might say, without making
any bones about it; and, what with the
kiss and her beating heart, I lost my head
altogether and kissed her ; and just then
the senior came and pinched me.
“Muriel, being in that state of which
I forget the word —not dressed for the
street —ran back, and I didn’t have the
heart to explain to my senior. And
thatis all, sergeant.”
DREWER bowed his head. The ser-
U geant made a great effort to con-
trol his twitching lip.
“Brewer, I believe you,” he said. “I
exonerate you from blame. And I’ll
say nothing of this to your comrades.
You’ll appreciate that, I’m sure?”
“I do!” said Brewer fervently.
The sergeant held out his hand.
“Brewer, as man to man, I congratulate
you on your betrothal, and I hope you’ll
be happy.”
“I hope so, thank you, sergeant. But
there’s going to be serious trouble,” said
Brewer gloomily. “There’s always a
thorn. I understand I can learn to play
that ukulele in eight lessons by postal
correspondence; but blowed if I ever
could sing two notes of a plain song like
‘Nellie Bly’ in their right key. Now, how
am I going to learn that God-forsaken
gondola music?”

POWER DIVE
BY
CLIVE JASON.
A final glance at the splotchy earth
below him, and he pushed the stick
forward and fed her the gun. On the
pad below Immelmann Turn he
entered Power Dive.
GUY WARING sat on the corner of
a table in the drafting-room of the
Irvin Aircraft Works, eyeing in-
tently the glowing tip of his cigarette.
Across the table Gunter, the general
manager, sat tilted back in his chair,
whistling noiselessly and polishing im-
maculate fingernails on the sleeves of his
coat. At the designing table under the
window Newton Heath pored with last-
minute intentness over the specifications
of the Vl6, the fingers of his left hand
drumming a nervous tattoo on the yellow
wood. Outside in the sunlight mechanics
were wheeling the new machine out of
its hangar, their blurred talk and
laughter emphasising the tense silence
inside the room.
EIGHTEEN years, thought Waring,
since his first flight; he ought to get
out while he still had the chance. He was
the last of the old gang, anyway ; Curly
and Nick Morton had both gone, their
widows had collected the insurance, and
now they were only a memory. Three
years in the air during the war, and
fifteen years of test flying, hurling new
and untried machines round the sky and
savaging them like a man on an un-
broken colt. Crazy speed models, auto-
gyros, repair jobs—the test pilots took
them all up and flung them round the
heavens with merciless skill, looking for
the weak spot, searching for the evi-
dences of just a little bit too much imagi-
nation in the drafting-room. Sometimes
they came down in one piece, a good
’plane ; sometimes they cracked up, with
the pilot fighting for his life to bail out
before the wreckage caught him. Maybe
he would be lucky enough to come clear
with his parachute.
Nick Morton and Curly had been un-
lucky.
Waring laughed mirthlessly. What
chance had either of them had to bail
out? Curly’s engine had stalled as he
took off, and his ’plane had tossed over
and over on its nose, with the engine
bowling along in front like a ball. Just
a twisted heap of metal and splintered
wood when it finished, with Curly some-
where inside. Then Nick Morton, in a
low-winged monoplane, had ripped the
wings off her doing 300 in a speed
dive. A fat chance he’d had of bailing
out, with a five-mile-a-minute breeze
waiting to rip his head off his shoulders
the moment he showed it above the cock-
pit. The thought of the power dive was

gnawing at his brain. Of all the stunts
that the wit of man had devised to test
a new ’plane he hated the power dive
the most; had always hated it, he in-
sisted, whereas his uneasiness in a low-
winger had only come to him since Nick
had crashed. The Vl6 was a low-wing
monoplane.
Vy ARING slid off the table and lounged
” outside to the concrete apron. The
monoplane crouched in the sunlight by
the open hangar, a mechanic polishing
the gleaming cowling. She looked good,
the pilot admitted; revolutionary, yet
perfect in every different aspect. Almost
impossible to fault her on paper or on
the ground ; but in the air—that was dif-
ferent. You found all you wanted to
know in a split second ; more than all the
theory in the world would ever teach.
“Meet the girl friend,” said the
mechanic with a wave of his hand.
“She’d fly to hell for you if you asked
her nicely.”
"Or with you, quite unasked,” said
Waring.
The mechanic started to speak, closed
his mouth and went on with his
polishing.
Waring peered along the underside of
the wing at the tail, his eyes puckered
thoughtfully, then drew back a little and
squinted down the line of the fuselage.
He rubbed the heel of his hand over his
chin in doubt. She looked queer there,
and no mistake. He stared intently
down the underside of the wing once
more. There was the point that was
worrying him, That wing was set so that
the tail would be in an airshadow while
diving at speed. Running in a vacuum
the tail surfaces would not grip, and she
couldn’t pull out. He could imagine the
stick slipping loosely about in his hand,
moving lax and free, while the ’plane
dived on, uncontrolled . . .
He ground the stub of his cigarette
under his heel, and without a word
strolled back to the drafting-room.
ET’s look at those slip-stream curves
•Li again,” he asked Heath. The de-
signer flipped a blue-print over to him,
and Waring stretched it out on the table.
The back of his hand was puckered with
tiny scars from a spatter of splinters
when a machine-gun burst had shattered
his instrument-board back in TB. He
ran a long, lean forefinger over the lines,
pausing dubiously on the curve at 350
mr.p.h. The curve was marked approxi-
mate. Waring sucked in his lower lip
thoughtfully, then with a shrug of his
shoulder shoved the print back. His
hand was quite steady as he lit a fresh
cigarette.
“Those slip-stream curves at 350,
marked approximate,” he asked casually
—“are they estimates, or what?”
“A close estimate,” amended Heath.
“Had to be at that speed.”
Waring grinned mirthlessly. Maybe
he was wrong.
“With all due deference, Heath,” the
pilot continued, “I’m damned if I like
those low-wing monoplanes. It’s next to
impossible to get perfect balance of the
control-surfaces, and you know what
wing-flutter means at high speed ; they
crumple up like cardboard.”
“There will be no trouble with the
V 16,” returned the designer slowly. “She
is perfect in every detail.”
Waring flicked his ash viciously into
the fireplace.
“Maybe,” he grunted. “I’ll tell you
all about it when I bring her down.”
Gunter set his chair on four legs, and
walked over to the table.
“It’s the best machine the works have
turned out yet,” he said enthusiastically.
“Just look at those specifications. Mars-
den evaporative-cooled engine; abso-
lutely the last word in the aviation world.
Reduces the drag on the plane to a mini-
mum, and uses the new anti-knock fuel
with an octane rating of 87. Eighty-
seven,” he repeated reverently, “and the
best of them has been no higher than 77.”
The three men leaned over the table.
“There is no machine in the world with
lines as clean as this. Not a break any-
where ; even the exhaust-pipes are
brought together at the nose and run
under the fuselage.”
Waring caught Heath’s eye and shared
his thought; stealing the designer’s
thunder. He straightened up and said
nothing. Newton Heath glanced out the
window. “Our military expert is outside.”
“Let’s go,” said the pilot, drifting
casually through the open door. He
shook hands with the military man, and
the four of them moved over to the
monoplane. No idle curiosity had brought
him here ; the Air Force crowd had their
eye on the Vl6 as a likely machine of
the interceptor type. She looked well on
paper ; new and speedy, an advance in
revolutionary design. Again Waring got
that peculiar impression of the machine
crouching, as though' even on the ground
she was poised for instant flight.
“Well, I’ll be on my way,” he said.
The military expert turned towards him.
“What are you going to do with her?”
“Oh, the routine test,” answered
Waring easily.
“Going to put her through the power
dive?”
For a fraction of a second Waring
hesitated.
“Yes,” he said, and moved off into
the open hangar. He took his flying-
suit from the wall. Why in hell had he
said he would put her through the dive?
He ought to bank on his own judgment
rather than on Heath’s. After all, he knew
a ’plane when he saw one, though he
mightn’t be so hot on the differential
calculus. He had flown them all—three-
wingers, flying-boats, Moths ; they knew
and admitted his right to speak with
authority. But he had burnt his boats
now; he couldn’t go out and say he
didn’t think she would pull out of a
speed dive. He buttoned up his suit and
stepped out into the strong sunlight,
swinging his helmet in his hand. On the
ground by the Vl6 lay his parachute.
“Prepared for a crash?” asked the
military man, nodding at the ’chute.
Waring and Newton glanced sharply at
each other, both thinking of the chance
he’d have if she cracked up.
“Yes,” said the pilot briefly.
LIE stood there feeling strangely un-
willing to go, and an uneasy silence
descended on the little group. The
mechanic had finished his polishing, and
was standing waiting, shuffling from one
foot to another. With a wordless ex-
clamation Waring swung round on his
heel, and climbed into the tiny cockpit.
He signalled to the mechanic ; the starter
moaned, and the engine roared into
sudden life. Watching the rising oil-
gauge he pulled the joystick back and
opened her up slowly, and as the terrific
roar reverberated in the empty hangar
behind him he eased the throttle down
again, then snapped the safety-belt round
his waist, wedging himself tight against
the back of the seat. He pulled down the
straps of his parachute, and clipped them
in position. A nod of the head, and the
chocks were kicked away from the
wheels. The Vl6 taxied forward, then
swung round, with the whole length of
the flying field in front of her. With a
flattening roar she bumped over the
short grass; then the ground dropped
away from beneath her fuselage.
Waring put her into a steep climb,
pulling the stick back and giving her the
gun. She flew beautifully, eager and
responsive, but the rhythmic roar of the
engine seemed to be beating on his brain.
Power dive, power dive, power dive. He
shook his head impatiently. Like a kid
in a train, reading words into the click-
ing of the wheels. She climbed terrifi-
cally fast; she’d come down a damn
sight faster, he thought grimly. Three
minutes to 6000 feet, and no sign of
cloud. He jotted down a note on his pad.
If only he had had this crate during the
war ; he would have been the kingpin
then. Still, someone would probably
have it in the next —and it would be out
of date. On she went, singing her way
up an invisible slope, with the altimeter
chasing height round the dial. He had
been perspiring under the heavy helmet
when he started, but the cold of the
empty spaces was striking him now, and
his breath came short and sharp in the
thin air. As she swung out on to a level
keel at 22,000 he reached slowly out for
his pad, and laboriously noted “Ceiling,
22,000.”
The electric clock fitted to his altimeter
looked after the timing of the climb ;
must have been a record, he thought.
Shoving the stick over, he brought her
down in wide, sweeping spirals; then,
banking her over sharply, he put her into
a series of hair-raising sideslips, catch-
ing her up as adroitly as a cricketer
catches a ball. Then the loop, flinging
her end over end, with the wind scream-
ing past the wing. The chequered earth
below him flashed round and over the
blue sky in relentless confusion, and the
safety-strap pressed hard against his body
as he was flung forward. He peered
overside at the wings, nerves taut, watch-
ing for a sign of the fatal flutter.
They were as steady as a rock.
THE exhilaration of the high altitudes
mounted to his head, and he drove
her confidently up, then down again in a
falling leaf. A kick of the rudder, and
the stick eased back. She came out per-
fectly. For a full half-hour he hurled
her round, testing and searching her like
a surgeon X-raying for a weak spot, and
holding her together with his hands and
feet. With her perfect performance his
full confidence returned to him, and he
pulled her on to an even keel at 18,000.
He thought of the little group on the
concrete apron below him watching with
eager, anxious eyes; the military officer,
cool and technical; Gunter, keen for the
prestige of the works ; Newton Heath,
watching a man hurtle round the skies

PLACE YOUR ORDER NOW
on the wings of his abstract ideas, made
concrete in the tumult of the workshop.
Heath, haunted by the memory of Nick
Morton, who had crashed to death in
his Vis'. Steady, though; a man didn't
want to think of that now: he wanted
his brain and nerves on ice; steady;
faultless in instant decision.
Now for an Immelmann. He had
never forgotten his first experience with
the Immelmann turn ; that Fokker over
Mossy Face Wood rearing up and over,
and then dropping down on the tail of
his Handley Page. A good shot, too ;
had shot away his instrument-board and
holed his petrol-tank with the first burst;
it had looked like curtains for him till
the Fokker struck trouble from above.
He had been glad to see the German get
away, clearing for his own lines with the
bit in his teeth —a damned fine airman.
He himself had managed to make a
lucky landing on his reserve tank—he
gazed thoughtfully at his scarred right
hand, his sole souvenir of the engage-
ment.
He pulled his stick back sharply, and
the Vl6 stood, on her tail. With a kick
of the rudder he banked her sharply over
the vertical, and she swung out at a
higher altitude headed in the opposite
direction. Such a damn simple thing ;
only the other fellow thought of it first.
Hundreds of good men shot down be-
cause they didn’t know the Immelmann
turn, and Immelmann himself killed after
they had learned his trick.
Well, now for the high jump—they’d
all be waiting down below for the
supreme test of a fighting ’plane ; the
limit of mechanical speed and human
endurance. He wedged himself tighter
into the seat; mustn’t be the slightest
risk of a false move or a slip. A final
glance at the splotchy earth below him,
and he pushed the stick forward and
fed her the gun. On the pad below
Immelmann Turn he entered Power Dive.
Above the terrific brazen bellow of the
engine rose the shrieking of the wind
past the cockpit; a high, wailing cres-
cendo that cut sharp across the flat roar.
The needle on the speed gauge swung
slowly round past the 300 mark, crept up
to 350, quivered and jammed hard
against the steel stop. The rising note
of the wind ripping past told him that
she was still gaining speed, but the gauge
was designed to go no further. On the
pad he noted: “Limiting speed in excess
of 350.” Losing more than 500 ft. a
second, the needle of the altimeter chased
frantically round the dial, like a dog after
its tail. The earth was reaching up
towards him at terrific speed, moving so
irresistibly that it seemed no power in
the universe could check it, and from its
even brown fields and buildings sprouted
through like giant mushrooms. Bring-
ing her out of this is rapier work com-
pared with the bludgeoning he had been
giving her ; a delicate easing back of the
joystick, tender, almost caressing as the
tail surfaces commence to bite, then out
on to a long, noiseless climb to lose
speed. The least little bit of a jerk, and
off the wings would come, fluttering to
earth like paper. He had better bring
her out about a thousand ; no sense in
cutting it too fine.
WITH the thought a black, unreasoning
panic seized him, greater than the
fear of death or burning. He knew she
wouldn’t pull out. The stick would come
back in his hand loose and unresponsive,
instead of fighting against the grip of the
air. He knew he was right and Heath
was wrong with his estimated curves.
This was the end if she came out. No
more flying for him ; no more crazy and
unendurable speed. He’d get out. The
relentless needle hovered above the
1000 mark. “Now,” he gritted, and
eased the stick back.
For an agonising instant it swung
loose and sloppy.
Then, almost imperceptibly, he felt the
Vl6 swing outwards, and with a gasp of
' relief he started her on a mile-long zoom-
ing climb.
The reaction had left him strangely
weak, and as she came back into control
L he automatically headed her down wind,
and then swung her round and down to
a three-point landing. That peculiar feel-
ing of lassitude and unreality stayed with
him as he climbed out. He saw Newton
Heath coming towards him, his face
contorted with fury. “What’s the matter
with him?” he wondered ; then without
warning Heath swung his arm back and
cracked him between the eyes. What a
damn silly thing to do, Waring thought,
and sank to his knees, blackness coming
over him.
THE Vl6 crashed nose first into the
flying field, embedded like an arrow,
and a column of flame and smoke roared
up to the sky.
“The second,” thought Newton Heath,
his face white and twisted. He heard
Waring’s voice, “Those curves at 350-
are they estimates?”
My Political
Life
By W. A.HOLMAN
FEDERAL
ARBITRATION
W. M. Hughes’s
agitation for the
enlarged powers
of the Common-
wealth now ran to its inevitable end. It
was defeated by a substantial majority.
Towards the close of the campaign it
had been obvious that there was not
going to be, by any means, a unanimous
Labor vote. Our more steady-going
supporters remained firm on their feet,
in spite of the wild rush of the new pro-
paganda. The promise had been held
out to the unions of a settling of every-
body’s troubles under the new scheme by
Mr. Justice Higgins, the president of the
Federal Arbitration Court, whose tri-
bunal was more popular than that of the
State courts because he was believed
to be more sympathetic with Labor’s
claims.
It began to be understood towards
the end, however, that if the case
of every union in the whole of the six
States had to be taken before one Arbi-
tration Judge, there would not be enough
of that Judge to go round, and the
consequence —that other Judges might
have to be appointed who might be as
disappointing in their attitude as some
of those already sitting in the State
courts —was enough to damp the ardor
of those who could see clearly enough to
grasp it. The whole of the five proposals
into which Hughes’s scheme had been
formulated were rejected.
Clearly, it was not going to be mere
waste effort to prepare our own new
Industrial Arbitration laws. The unions
were beginning to accept the idea, and
our inner knowledge of
their working con-
vinced us that with pro-
per handling and en-
couragement they
would come to do so
more and more. At
the same time a num-
ber of militant Labor-
ites refused to have
anything to do with
arbitration. They
struck as before. The
law against striking,
always feebly enforced,
had been enforced
more feebly than ever
since we took office.
Strikers generally went
unprosecuted, and even
when fines were im-
posed no serious effort
to enforce them was
made.
Critics were to be
found who urged, on
account of these fail-
ures, that arbitration
should be abolished
altogether. These
critics, we pointed out,
did not propose to re-
peal Wade’s Act to put
down gambling on the ground that a
certain amount of gambling still went
on, or to abolish the criminal code
Beeby.
because all crimes had not ceased, and
so on. The Arbitration Acts had already
reduced the number of strikes, and
amendment and careful administration
would lead to further reductions. But
the Act as it stood had largely broken
down. Many unions were ignoring its
remedial provisions and defying those
which were penal.
BEEBY’S
SCHEME
Beeby now pro-
posed to rescue
us by means
which were
simple and ingenious. His plan, reduced
to its elements, was this: he proposed
to replace the general prohibition by a
qualified permission to unions to strike ;
but only if they gave proper notice, and
if on a secret ballot of their members
they got an absolute
majority to support it.
Otherwise everybody
concerned in a strike,
or in aiding and abet-
ting, was to be subject
to heavy penalties.
This change, we hoped,
would operate in two
ways. If all such mat-
ters had to be referred
to a ballot, the sober
level-headedness of the
majority would gener-
ally veto striking. The
steadier and more re-
sponsible men do not
attend the general
meetings, and those
who do attend find an
electricity in the atmo-
sphere which carries
them off their feet. A
secret ballot, in which
every member partici-
pates, gives common-
sense its chance.
The second result
would have been a
gradual sorting out of
the unions into those
which relied on strikes
and those which did
not. Already the more rational and
fair-dealing unions were beginning to

find irksome the appeals for subscrip-
tions continually made by others that
preferred the excitement of downing
tools. I had only a few weeks before
discussed this aspect of the matter with
an officer of an important union.
“For 10 years,” he said, “we have
managed to settle all our difficulties
through the Arbitration Court. We have
paid all our own expenses there, and we
have never asked another union for a
farthing ; but every week we are asked
to contribute to the fighting fund of this
or that union which we are told is out
on strike and fighting valiantly for its
rights. Only this week such and such a
union has come to us asking us to strike
a levy. We asked them why they did not
go to the Arbitration Court. Their dele-
gate said that they were too manly ;
that it was a matter of principle. It is
not a matter of manliness or principle at
all ; it is a matter of their sponging upon
us.”
I was satisfied that this utterance
represented a view much more wide-
spread than expressed, and that legisla-
tion which would strengthen the position
of the unions sharing it would materi-
ally help along the cause of industrial
peace.
MAKING
ARBITRATION
ACCEPTABLE
It was essential
to make the idea
of appealing to
the Court as
attractive as pos-
sible. The delays,
technicalities and appeals which had
been quoted by the diehards as argu-
ments in favor of the strike method
were all to be got rid of. The Wages
Boards were abolished ; the number of
courts increased, and power taken to
add to the total number of the Arbi-
tration Judges from time to time should
the work prove too much for the exist-
ing body. Here Beeby’s experience of
industrial work was invaluable, and
with the bill as it left us we could
give a guarantee that claims brought
by unions to the Arbitration Court
sjiould be dealt with promptly and
grievances got rid of before they had
time to irritate.
This measure was shorn of several
important features at the ruthless hands
of the Legislative Council. It passed,
however, and has been the nucleus of
the Arbitration law of the State ever
since.
GOVERNMENT
BY BARE
MAJORITY
On May 16,
1911, we met
Parliament for
our second ses-
s i o n with a
Governor’s speech
of my own drafting which embodied
the results of all our preliminary labors.
Land-settlement and industrial legis-
lation were forecast along the lines I
have related. The machinery for ad-
vancing loans to settlers was, if possible,
to be made adequate. I undertook, as
Attorney-General, to establish a Court of
Criminal Appeal and a Public Trustee
and to amend various laws, and Car-
michael had a scheme for a working and
genuine sinking fund, a fine idea to
the execution of which Fate proved
adverse.
It is interesting to notice, however, in
the light of later events, how very
jejune our educational proposals were.
Beeby was trying to combine the work
of that department with* that of Labor
and Industry, to which he was chiefly
attracted, so that Public Instruction
work got only scraps of his attention.
The proposal to connect the North Shore
with Sydney appeared in that catalogue
of schemes under the title of “Tunnels
under Port Jackson.”
AN OMNIBUS
PROGRAMME
The enormous
list of proposals
which we pre-
sented was re-
ceived with not unnatural derision. It
would take 10 years to pass such a pro-
gramme. Did we imagine that we had
taken a lease of the Treasury benches?
But we had determined not to lose
the priceless opportunity offered by the
opening session. We considered that it
would pay us better to get a carefully-
thought-out programme before the coun-
try, even if we were to go out at once,
than to omit proposals to which we in-
tended, “if spared,” to give effect. The
Governor’s speech had been disrespect-
fully referred to as a big tin bucket into
which everything was to he thrown. No
proposal was
barred. Money
was no object—
except to Car-
michael, who was
Acting-Treasurer,
and he, as a
junior, could be
easily hustled
aside.
All criticisms
admitted, the pro-
gramme w a s—
given the neces-
sary time, voting
strength and
finance—an emi-
nently practical
one. We were all
practical men.
We knew what
we wanted. And
this was an effort,
made with a good
Storey.
deal of intelligence and an enormous
amount of application, to fill those wants.
Few Governments, however, have been
through a more extraordinary series of
adventures than those which now beset
ours. This part of my story begins with
the resignations of Dunn and Horne,
two members who had entered our party
for the first time at the election. These
occurred over a controversy now so en-
tirely forgotten that it appears almost to
belong to the Dark Ages. As, however,
it changed the whole current of our his-
tory and led, among other serious con-
sequences, to our losing Neilsen as a col-
league, some effort must be made here
to set forth the issues of the dispute.
“HOMESTEAD
SELECTIONS”
Our Crown
lands, it has al-
ready been ex-
plained, were for
many years alienated in strictly limited
holdings. Owing to the ease with which
the blocks could be transferred, these
small holdings were rapidly amalgamating
into big ones. To check this Carruthers
had, in 1895, introduced a law providing
that all Crown lands should be granted
as perpetual leases (not as freeholds)
under conditions which made it impos-
sible for anyone to hold two blocks.
This scheme arrested the march of con-
centration; but deprived the settler of the
easy financing conferred by a power to
mortgage freely or to sell. The holders
of homestead selections, as the new per-
petual leases were called, had no title
deeds to offer as security against an ad-
vance, and the banks, therefore, would
not, or could not, help them; and
although an Advance Board had been
established by the Government its re-
sources were limited and its methods) un-
satisfactory. By 1908, accordingly, the
settlers under Carruthers’s Act were de-
manding to be given the freeholds of
their selections, and their agitation had
caused the Wade Government to intro-
duce a measure, known as the Conver-
sion Bill, empowering them to “convert”
their perpetual leases back into the earlier
freehold (or conditional purchase). The
Labor party had strenuously opposed
this bill, and had pledged itself, if
successful, to repeal it, and Neilsen was
now in charge of a repeal measure which
restored the Carruthers scheme
THIS somewhat technical explanation is
. essential to an understanding of the
minor dispute which now arose. All
Labor men were in those days in agree-
ment that the general right to convert
into freehold should disappear. We were
also all in agreement that those who had
actually converted should be 'protected
in their new titles. But what about those
who had had the right to convert con-
ferred upon them by the recent legis-
lation but had not yet availed themselves
of it?
Here there was a sharp division of
opinion. Neilsen held that no wrong
would be done these holders by replacing
them in the position they held when they
first applied for Crown land. They then
wanted to become leaseholders—without
the right of conversion. They always
had been leaseholders. They had never
used the right to convert. If now that
right were withdrawn they were simply
back to where they were at the beginning.
On the other side it was argued that
present holders were actually endowed
with the right by Parliament, that many
properties had changed hands on the
strength of it and that, however we might
by our new bill decide to alter the con-
ditions under which future applications
lor holdings should take them, we could
not adversely affect the position of exist-
ing holders without spoliation.
Unfortunately, there had been no
authoritative commitment of the party to
either view. Members had been free to
pledge themselves as they chose ; many
had done so. Unfortunately, too, Neilsen
had bound himself to the severer view,
to which, as speedily became apparent,
a majority was opposed. His determina-
tion to stand to his election promises
at any cost rapidly led to a difficult posi-
tion all round. At the same time we had
no expectation of any immediate crisis.
We knew that a number of the country
members felt very strongly opposed to
Neilsen’s proposals, but we had no idea
that any of them were going to extremes.
The opening day of the session passed
without alarming developments. A vote
of censure was moved, and the Oppo-
sition, with a sound strategic instinct,
had directed it at our weak spot—our
lands policy. Stories of the dissensions
between Neilsen and our supporters had
long before made the rounds. It was
hoped by raising this issue to get some
of our men between two minds and de-
tach them from their allegiance.
STOREY'S
INDEPENDENTS
But we were
fortunate in the
existence, for the
moment, of an
“Independent” party of seven which,
though its members differed on most
things, was bound together by as keen
a repugnance to anything in the shape
of an unnecessary election as ever burned
in a Parliamentary bosom.
These seven gentlemen were for the
moment marshalled into a united band
under the guidance of David Storey
(long afterwards my colleague as Minis-
ter for Health). To Storey himself elec-
tions were matters of no consequence,
his Randwick seat being sure and his
fortune (which derived from hats) large.
But he was a generous and jovial spirit
who favored the idea of giving the new
Government “a show.” Supported in
this view—though for entirely other
reasons —by the six resolute patriots
who formed his team, he was prepared
to accept a suggestion from me that he
should not support a censure based on
the mere mention of. our lands policy
in the Governor’s speech, but should
defer hostile action at least until the
measures embodying it were introduced.
I listened to the opening speech of the
censure vote with comparative equanim-
ity, based partly on my consciousness of
the general rectitude of our intentions
and partly on Storey’s highly satisfactory
attitude. In my reply I stressed the un-
fairness of attacking the Government’s
land policy before that policy had been
produced, and urged the House to hold
its hand. As I did this I must have un-
consciously directed a glance towards the
cross-benches where the Independents
were seated.
“FITZ” AND
EDDEN
J. C. L. Fitz-
patrick, one of
the keenest Par-
-1 i a m e n t arians,
noticed this, and said in a pause: “Mr.
Holman, when you say that, why do
you look there?” pointing with unde-
viating finger to the little group of stal-
warts who were to save us.
Our arrangement with them, not yet
common property, had clearly leaked
out, and this shrewd query of Fitzpat-
rick’s, followed by a roar of Opposition
laughter, left me for the moment without
a rejoinder. Edden replied for me. As
a Durham miner of an earlier generation
he was completely familiar with the
Psalms, and still more completely un-
mindful of aspirates. He ejaculated with
neat promptitude, “I will lift up mine
heyes to the ’ills, whence my help
cometh,” and brought down the House.
The Opposition had to join. Members
admitted that the laugh had passed to our
side, and the rest of the debate was good-
humored enough. The Storeyites rallied
around us like men, and the censure

Nine out of every ten persons suffer more or less
from Liver Complaint. That feeling of “No .energy”
and “Not too well” are hut symptoms of a weak and
disordered system. Weak because the whole vitality
is absorbed, inactive kidneys, and constipated bowels.
For not only is the Liver the largest and one of the
most important organs in the human body, but when
deranged it becomes a source of endless suffering.
When the Liver is clogged by the inactivity of the
Kidneys and Bowels it becomes torpid, and fails to filter
the bile from the blood, thus producing Biliousness and
a general impairment of the digestive system.
There is little use of treating the Liver separately, as
it can never be set right until the Kidneys and Bowels'
are made active in removing the waste matter from the
blood. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a searching,
cleansing remedy. They put a move in your Bowels,
life into the Liver, and tone the Stomach —thus bracing
up the system generally.

CHILDREN
Are Often the
Victims of Worms.
A child who is affected with Thread
Worms will often appear to the eye to be
in an indifferent state of health. It be-
comes peevish and irritable in its temper.
Another point to which the attention of
mothers should be specially directed is
that the child is apt to start in its sleep,
its repose being in the way of a disturbed
nature.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to
recognise the fact that their little ones are
suffering intense pain and distress, and are
practically irresponsible for the outbursts
of temper, restlessness and peevishness,,
and until some more serious symptoms
appear nothing is done to alleviate the
distress. The symptoms of this disease are
somewhat variable, but generally they arc
so characteristic that no mother need have
any doubt. The best proof of worms is
worms, and if the general conduct of the
child is such as to cause the slightest
suspicion, a careful watch will give ample
proof.
Worms, by their movements and the
interruption they offer to the contents of
the bowels, generally occasion pain or
uneasiness in the abdomen, sometimes
spasmodic, sometimes gnawing and bit-
ing, and not infrequently of a vague,
indescribable character, and yet very dis-
tressing. Sympathetic with this is a
sensation of itching at the nostrils, pro-
ducing a disposition to pick the nose,
which is characteristic of the affection.
The bowels are often disordered, some-
times relaxed, as in dysentery.
appetite is exceedingly variable ; in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving
or depraved, one condition not infre-
quently alternating with another. The
abdomen is often hard, swollen and tym-
panetic, the breath heavy or foetid, and
tongue furred, with disagreeable taste,
and a copious flow of saliva; swelling
of the upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils,
and disposition to grind the teeth during
sleep are other characteristic symptoms.
