The recent heavy gale in Sydney, which did so much damage, caused
absolutely no leaks in Malthoid Roofs.
We have had no complaints whatever—showing that though tiles
and galvanised iron proved unequal to the occasion—Malthoid
remained undamaged.
It pays to use Malthoid—which, though costing less than half the
price of galvanised iron—is safest and most reliable in a severe
trial.

Australian Nursery Rimes
The kid thru edits this page has had
approximately a thousand Australian nursery
rimes to choose from, lie has even found a
few genuine .Australian rimes already sung
by oui kiddies. Ethel Pawley has heard
Australian kiddies sing:—•
Captain Cook
Broke his hook
Fishing for Australia.
Captain Cook
AVrote a book
All about Australia-
That is the best our folk-lore has done : we
can consciously do much better.
A number of competitors make the sugges-
tion that from the selected nursery rimes a
children’s illustrated book Should be made,'
for sale tit Christmas for a war-funfl. The
results of tins competition will he submitted
to a publisher, though time is short for the
publication of such a book, properly illus-
trated, by the Christmas season. The con-
sent of all competitors to such a scheme is
taken for granted, and each selected contri-
bution wilhhear its author’s signature.
Despite our prohibition many parodies
were sent in, though in some cases these were
mere Australian versions of well-known nur-
sery ripie-fofms. Thus it seems hard to over-
look a pleasant and 4 genuinely Australian
variant of “Ten Little Nigger Boys,” in
which "Ten Little Rabbits” are similarly
decimated, since their fates are genuinely
Australian. • The author’s name has been
lost, owing tp his, or her, failing to sign every
page of the MS.
' TEN LITTLE RABBITS.
Ten little Rabbits playing round' a mine,
One slipped down a shaft, then there were nine.
Nine little Rabbits, hopping through a gate,
One caught in a snare, then there were eight.
Eight little Rabbits, gazing up to Heaven,
All eagle hawk swooped down on one, Then there were
seven.
Seven little Rabbits, up tp their tricks,
When a red fox grabbed one, then there were six.
Six little Rijbbits, hunted in a drive,
One got a dose of shot, then there were five.
Five little Rabbits, drinking round a bore,
One got. squirted up, then there were four,
Four little Rabbits, Scratching round a tree,
One ate a quince- jag# bait, and then there were three.
Three little Rabbits saw a jaekeroo,
One got asphyxiated, then there were two.
Two little Rabbits, flirting in the sun,
A gohanna. swallowed one, then there was one,
One little Rabbit, feeling lonely, when
.She had a family, and again there were ten.
Many competitors made the mistake of for-
warding long narrative rimes. Where the
youngster wants narrative it must be short.
Act One: Enter Miss Muffet. sits, eats curds
ahd whey. Act Two: Enter Spider, sits
beside her. Act Three: Exit Miss Muffet.
Curtain. When the mouse ran up the clock
all it did was to run down again. The black
hen merely laid eggs, with a feminine desire
to please the male, for gentlemen. Some-
times she laid nine, and occasionally, Avith a
praiseworthy effort, ten. Georgie Porgie
bravely kissed the girls, but they inexplicably
wept. However, when they began to play,
he merely ran away. Though there is a sec-
ond verse to the accident to Jack and Jill,
fetv children Avant that anti-climax. Mary’s
lamb has three verses and a moral, though
n 6 child is interested in its subsequent adven-
tures. There are exceptions, of course, but
these are nursery rimes that kiddies have to
have read to them.
The classical example of nursery rimes,
“Hey, Diddle, Diddle!” illustrates the perfect
form. The child merely wants moving pic-
tures —puss plays a fiddle, a coAv makes a
magnificent leap, a dog breaks into mistimed
hilarity, and an elopement occurs among the
table cutlery. These pictures have no con-
nection with each other: there is no short-
story—just haphazard pictures of things
familiar to the child’s mind. And nothing
that is flashed on the child’s mental screen
appears ludicrous to it: these happenings are,
in the child’s mental world, interesting and
possible.
Many competitors wore too clever, too
sophisticated. Some gave us pathos for
groAvn-ups. Some even inflicted puns on the
kid. Many told stories of kids, not to kids.
A feAV wrote lullabies, not nursery rimes.
Though nursery rimes are in the first instance
taught to children, their delight is to learn
them themselves. And many rimes were
spoilt by a roughness of the metre: the kid’s
ear will pass by many faults if the tune goes
trippingly.
J*
The rimes submitted may be roughly
divided into these classes: Abo. rimes,
Station-life, City-life, Nonsense rimes, Nat-
ural History, and •War-rimes.
111 the Abo.-class Joice M. Nankivell gives
us the abo.-version of the kookkooburra’s
laugh, which means in native language:
“Take a stick.”
Gong gmir gahgah, goug gour gahgah,
Laughs the Kookkooburra,
Gong gour gahgah, goug gour gahgah,
Loud to one another :
Goug gour gahgah, take a stick,
Goug gour gahgah, take it quick,
Kookkooburra, liookkooburra;
Goug gour gahgah, throw it high,
Till at last it strikes the sky,
Goug gour gahgah, goug gour gahgah,
There it sets the sun a-burning,
And assures the days returning,
Goug gour gahgah, goug gour gahgah,
Kookkooburra, ICookkoobura.
The native names in the following. Angela
Kennedy assures us, are well known :
Little Ji-ka Ji-ka ! All the darkies like her
In her dainty Sunday dress and pinny. -
Give her wattle-blossom and a joey ’possum—
She’s a good Australian piccaninny.
And she lives outside. Benalla with her father, Doutta
Galla,
Who eats snakes for breakfast till lie’s pale.
He . kills them with a waddy, and 'devours the head
and body—
And Little Ji-ka Ji-lca eats the tail!
The Avar has become a paramount interest
in most Australian kiddies’ minds. 11. W.
Stewart provides the best Kid’s Complete
History of the Wav: —
Over the sea is my Daddy to-day,
Over the sea in Flanders.
When I feel lonely for him I say;
Daddy has gone with the guns
Fighting the German Huns
Over the sea in Flanders-
Gone with the guns
Fighting the Huns
Over the sea in Flanders.
The Moral Tale is not strictly a nursery
rime: it is merely a mean advantage taken
by the grown-up to frighten the kid. How-
ever, as a curiosity, Jean Maepherson’s is
printed for its Australian setting:—
The fierce and frightful Bunyip
Lives in a lonely scrub,
And catches all the dirty boys
AVIIO do not like their tub.
He has a rapid aeroplane
Steered by a flying-fox,
To grab the naughty little girls
AVho never darn their sox.
And many a bov who played the wag
The. fearsome Bunyip caught,
And girls who would not do their task
Back to his den he brought.
There in a dark and horrid pool
He -soaks the dirty boys,
And Teeds small bunyips on the girls
In spite of all their Doise.
Home Life in town and country is respon-
sible for some delightful rimes. R. H. Croll,
taking advantage of the license allowed in
nursery riming, gives us this delightful
dressing song; but it is a song for Mother,
not for the kid.
Sonny boy, sonny boy, just me and you.
Here’s a little jacket, here’s a little shoe.
Daddy’s gone to fight for him. far away in France.
This year’s petticoats, next year’s pants.
And here are two modem city-jingles: —
Butcher! Butcher! Butcher’s cart,
Coming clown the street!
Baby wants an apple-tart;
Mummy wants some meat!
AA r . A, R.
Tinkle! Tinkle! Telephone!
Mummy’s gone to town*
All the trams are coming home!
Tinkle! Tinkle-! Telephone!
Buzz.
G. K. SoAvard’S rime deserves space because
it aptly expresses the Australian liking for
the rain. Where the English kid tells his
rain to go away and come again another
day, the Australian youngster sings this :
Rain ! Rain ! ,
Come, down with you rain!
Don’t keep away any longer.
The holes are all dry,
And mummy will cry
If you keep away any longer!
Rain! Rain!
You’ll get the cane
If you stay away any longer!
My daddy will sigh,
And the little lambs die,
If you stay away any longer!
Rain! Rain!
Dear, ducky rain,
Don’t stay away any longer!
I’ll buy you a train
And a sweet silver chain,
If you won't stay away any longer!
Tavo Outback vignettes:—
Denis drives the waggon
Click clack, click clack,
Denis drives the waggon
Far away and back.
Dobbin draws the waggon,
Down the sandy track,
Dobbin draws the waggon
..Far away and back.
Mary E. Fullerton.
Muster, muster.
All of a cluster;
Bring in the sheep to be shorn.
Bluster, fluster,
Southerly buster;
Poppity’s pants are torn.
Tup Mann.
An Australian variant of an old nursery
idea: — >
My little bush humpy ,
Baby’s Head—- Of wattle and dab,
„ Hair—AVith bark on the roof
~ Nose—• And chimney of slab.
„ Mouth-—The door’s in the middle.
~ Eyes— The windows are two —
~ Eyelids—So pull down the blinds,
Or folks will look through.
H. E. P. Bracey.
Edgar L. Stevens’ hoof-beat measure is
clumsier than this chaining one by Walter
E. Perroux :
OLD BOB'S CANTER.
Three ha’pence for tuppence,
Three ha’pence for tuppence,
That’s what the hoofbeats do say.
Daddy rode off to the township
To buy me a Dolly to-day.
Soon I will hear him returning,
Bob's canfer will tell me so true.
Three ha'pence for tuppence.
Three ha’pence for tuppence.
Oh, Daddy, I do so love you !
The section devoted to Natural History
and observation bulks largest in this compe-
tition. A selection: —
Wallaby, Wallaby, why do you jump.
And never fall down on your head with a bump?
And why is your tail so thick and so strong,
And your front legs so .short and hind legs so long?
N. M. 11.
There was a piccaninny and he always wanted honey,
„ But he didn’t ask his daddy, for lie' hadn’t any
money—-
He only tied a feather to a little bumble-bee
And chased it to its honeycomb inside a hollow tree.
Racey Beaver.
Said Billy Kooka to his mate,
“Hohohahahoho!
Let’s find a good fat fish to eat,
Hohohahahoho!” '
Dame Kooka gave her head a shake,
Hohohahahoho!
“1 see a fine fat tiger-snake,
Hohohahahoho!”
The snake was hit by Kooka’s beak,
Hohohahahoho!
And fish they did not further seek,
Hohohahahoho!
The snake was dropped from up aloft,
Hohohahahoho!
Until it. was quite nice and soft,
Hohohahahoho!
And then the Kookas laughed with' zest,
“Hohohahahoho!
For dinner tiger-snake is best,
Hohohahahoho!”
N. M. H.
Little -Billy Bandicoot
For potatoes loves, to root,
Bats them till his skin is tight
All the big, black, creepv night.
E. M. T.
Five grey rabbits who lived in a log
Were chased one day by a kangaroo dog'.
But though they ran hard from that kangaroo pup,
He caught and he killed and he gobbled them up.
“Royal Orange.”
Old Mother Kangaroo, stop ! stop ! stop !
AVith your baby in your pouch will you hop, hop,
hop ?
To see Mrs. ’Possum in the old gum-tree,
In a nice dark hole with little possies three.
Old Johnny Jackals sits up 011 top,
And he laughs, and he laughs, as if he couldn’t stop.
He gives Mrs. Possuni a pain in her head,
For he always wants to laugh when she wants to go
to bed.
E. L. Russell.
Six fat geese Were grazing by the shore,
They gobbled up grass till they could eat no more.
One flew east and one flew west,
And one flew on to a bulldog’s nest.
One flew north and -one flew south,
One flew into a dingo’s mouth.
The one that flew east fell into the sea,
The one that flew west stuck in a mulga tree,
The one that flew south had a long way to go,
. And then got smothered in the drifting snow.
The one that flew north was the fattest of the lot,
So I twisted her neck and put her in the pot.
J. H.
The weather is going to change!
Jackasses are down from the range.
AVhen you hear that jovial scoff,
A\ T et seasons are not far off.
Hoo, hob, hoo, hoo! Koo, hoo, ha hoo! Koo, kf>o,
hoo, hoo, hoo !
Black crows on the white gum-tree!
Now a scorching day is to he —
AVhen you hear that raucous cry,
Look out for a spell of “dry.”
Caw-eaw, caw-ik. Krore, krore, caw !
Jeanong.
The Bunyip lives in the dark lagoon;.
Of course we. can’t see him when there’s no moon,
And on moonlit nights he hides in his lair,
But all the same we know he is there.
An old blaekfellow told Uncle Jim
That his father's father said to him
That his father’s , father told him so;
Uncle Jim told us and that’s how we know.
Charles Macleax.
An old Kookaburra, sitting on a gum,
Was the first to see the white man come.
He laughed, “Ha-ha. What a queer, queer sight,
JUackboy, Blackboy, don’t get a fright,
Hurry up here, and have a look.
It’s Cook Cook Cook Cook, Cook Cook Cook,
00-00-00-00. Ah-ah-ah-ah. '
Cook, Cook, Cook.”
Bill.
There was once a baby ’Roo.
Baby ’Roo,
In a valley where the mallee
And the grasses always grew.
He would hop and skip and jump,
Baby ’Roo,
Such a happy little chappie,
Such a pretty fellow, too.
And when he was tired of play,
Baby ’Roo,
Niddy-noddy, sleepy-body,
Do you know what he would do?
Jump into his mother’s pocket!
Baby ’Roo,
Curl up warm there, safe from harm there,
Sleep and dream the whole night through.
Josephine.
The man from Mungundi was counting sheep;
He counted so many he went to sleep.
He counted by threes and he counted by twos,
The rams and the lambs and the wethers and-ewes;
He counted a thousand, a hundred and ten —'
And when he woke up he’d to count them again.
D. 11. S.
AA'hat are you doing
0 little grey bear?
AA'hat are you chewing,
O little grey bear?
Sitting on mothers back
Having a ride,
Eating the gum-leaves
Among which you hide,
You are so happy
A-hiding up there,
Can Baby come up to yefu,
Little grey bear?
Ethel Pawley.
Some interesting nonsense-rimes:
t here was a little Rabbit
That was biding in his burrow,
When the Dingo came and told him
To expect him there to-morrow;
But the Rabbit thought he'd rather
That the Dingo didn’t meet him ;
So lie found another burrow
And the Dingo didn’t eat him.

Greedy Tom grew round and fat,
Peevish Jim grew tall and flat;
Wouldn’t mend their ways at all;
Now Jim’s a Bat, and Tom’s a Ball.

Billy had a gum-boil
Which made poor Bifiy grumboil.
The doctor said:-“That's some boil!
And does your tummv rumboil?
It seems to me abnorinoil; .y
You’d better try some warm oil.”
So Billy got some hot oil,
And boiled it in a bottoil,
And on his gum did rub oil—
Which ended Billy’s trouboil!

The fluffy little native hear
Lived high up in a tree.
The naughty dingo called to him, -
“Why don’t you come to tea?”
“Because,” the little bear replied, - 81
“It won’t be good for me.”
And all the kookaburras laughed,
. “Ha hahaha hee heel”
R. G. Henderson.

Hujgh McCrae.
Wallaby, wallaby, why
Do all the birdies fly?
Instead of a hop,
They go off, flop-flop,
Wallaby, wallaby, why?
P. L. M.
Every kid will have his or her preference:
this kid confesses to several. “Six White
Cats” has the right jingle, but the pub-pub-
pub jars. Father is more likely to be found
there. Funny; but would kiddies think i!
funny? Somehow this kid suspects it will
become popular. “Josephine’s” Baby ’Roo is
neat and charming, but too matter-of-fact foi
the child’s wandering mind. “Bill’s” Kook-
aburra who greeted Captain Cook is too
clever. Some unnecessary lines, omitted bv
this page, put “Six Fat Geese” out of the
running. “Rain, rain !” will be popular out-
back ; hut it seems to have one verse too
many. Too long, too, is N.M.H.’s story oi
Billy Kooka and his mate. "Old Mother
Kangaroo” has the right atmosphere; “Little
Billy Bandicoot” has none : lie is just a drat
fact. “Muster, muster!” has the right rime
and metre, and the ludicrous surprise for its
climax. “Kangaroo, carry me,” is apt but
rather slight; and “WMlaby, Wallaby, why
do you jump?” rightly asks the question with-
out burdening the kid’s mjnd with the answer,
The “Five Grey Rabbit” is fearfully excit-
ing, and there is a*thrilling climax. It is
sure to be popular, owing to its galloping
metre. But this kid’s personal preference must
divided between “Old Bob’s Canter.” by
Walter E. Perroux, Proserpine, Q.. and “The
Man from Mungundi,” by D. H. Souter,
Sydney, whose name sometimes is signed in
other parts of this paper. The guinea is
divided between them, and all otner rimes
printed wall be paid for.

May Gibbs has made a genuine and an
original contribution to our Australian folk-
lore. Tier Gum-nuts and Gum-blossom
babies deserve their wide popularity: they
are as distinctive as the kewpie. Ready for
the Christmas season are two booklets by
this clever Australian girl. Gum-Blossom
Babies and Gum-Nut Babies (Angus and
Robertson. Sydney), in which May Gibbs
charmingly tells our kiddies all about the
habits and morals of these wee eucalyptus
fairy folk. The illustrations are captivat-
ing.
Will Lawson has written a bulky book
upon Historic Trentliam, the chief training-
camp for Harrimac Anzac (Wellington Pub-
lishing Co., M.L.). Every detail of train-
ing and of camp routine is doggedly de-
scribed, and frequent photographic illustra-
tions interrupt the flow of, dialogue. Inter-
esting, of course, to Maoriland ; but over here
-—well, we’re rather tired of the war; in
fact, it mildly annoys to learn that there is
a war still on somewhere. The rise in ferry
fares and the fail in the flow of the domestic
gas-metre are the only things that count.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S ‘FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

There are no teeth like those furnished by

Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap

ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-

are top severe on the enamel.

Nor pride, nor power, nor worldy praise;

The Avatar.
The wintry skies are bleak an£ grey,
t The birds are heavy on the wing,'
No new life stirs the bush to-day,
No light winds bring
Promise of the approaching spring.
Drab smoke hangs thick in the dead air,
The sodden hills with mist are crowned,
While dripping trees stand stark and bare,
And all around
The wet leaves flutter to the ground.
The pulse of life has sunken low,
In the still house all sounds are dumb,
And noiseless feet move to and fro,
As bruised and numb
The watching people go and come.
What is the sound they pause to hear?
What is the shape they dread to see?
The very bush seems hushed in fear,
And every tree
Stands crouched in awed expectancy
Death sends its heralds from afar,
Across the shadowy border-line:
When comes this ghostly avatar?
Dim candles shine,
The world seems waiting for a sign!
Above the house of nameless fears
Night’s veil is woven warp and woof,
When, lo! the dreaded sign appears!
Dark and aloof
A black crow flies across the roof.
VICTORIA.

In a Garden.
In this old garden where I walk
Laughter and tears I find
Pursue me, and in silence talk
Sweet memories in my mind.
Here are red roses dropping blood !
I see Adonis fly,
And hear from every crimson bud
Warm Cytherea sigh.
And there are lilies lost in thought
Whose leaves divinely grieve,
As in each chalice closely-caught
I mark the tears of Eve.
I move along from flower to flower
And pluck them wondering]y,
When sunset chimes the golden hour
Of twilight’s reverie.
I twine the lily and the rose
With sprays of milky may,
And violets whose odor flows
Fresh from the Appian Way.
A sigh breaks from the ruby rose.
I hear a step all-light
Ring rapture where the evening glows
Upon the heart of night.
It nears, and from the garden spring
Delicious dreams and true.
I stand in Eden marvelling.
Yet knowing it is you.
I pause....l wait. ...The minutes die
And drop out one by one.
Your step, film-footed, falters by
As it has ever done.
Blind-eyed with tears the shadows crowd
Upon my helpless head,
I make the flowers my bridal shroud....
Joy lives and yet is dead.
The mirthful stars spin bliss above.
I weep in agony,
Weaving the pall of hopeless love
Here in Gethsemane.

ZORA CROSS.
The Star Hunters.
When I was six and you were eight
It seemed not far to go
To where the round moon used to wait,
A-swing so soft and low
Upon the hilltop where the trees
Crooned all night long soft melodies.
So at the close of one Spring day
We crept from grown-up sight,
And scurried up the winding way,
Our hearts a-beat with fright.
And now and then we waved a hand—
We thought the moon would understand.
But she was sailing high o’erhead
When we had topped the hill,
So we crept home and went to bed,
Though had we gained our will
Upon her glowing silver breast
We had swung out into the West.
One night last year the moon leaned low,
A radiant ladder casting—
Moon-mist and star-dust all aglow,
And deep joy everlasting. .
At last our feet were on the way
To join the beckoning stars at play!
And then, somehow, we grew afraid
Of winds and fierce storms sweeping.
Did something of the glory fade?
Was that a grey cloud creeping?. ...
Poor, doubting hearts that lost the way
To join the golden stars at play!

GOODRICH FULL-SIZED
BLACK SAFETY-TREAD TYRES
STAND THE KNIFE TEST.
With its thick, tough, GOODRICH BLACK SAFETY
TREAD slashed back, its sinewy, resilient, Full-Sized
fabric body laid bare before you, it reveals the reason why
GOODRICH FULL-SIZED TYRES stand all tests.
For, contrary to common belief, tyres wear out inside as
well as outside.
By using GOODRICH FULL-SIZED TYRES you
minimise these risks —and why —
Because all Goodrich Tyres are Full-Sized and measure
up to the dimensions branded on them —and —being Full
Sized —give greater air space, consequently putting less
strain on the fabric casing.
Therefore —giving longer wear and more mileage, because
with its resilient rubber-saturated casing it is able to with-
stand internal heat (which is the enemy of tyres), so
making the tyre more durable.
Out of this resilience in Goodrich Safety Tread Tyres
comes Petrol saving— smoother riding comfort —and
prolonged mileage.
You cannot afford to be without Goodrich.
Get to know GOODRICH FULL-SIZED TYRES.
Put them to the test yourself by having at least one fitted
to your car.

PLAYING THE FOOL WITH
PREFERENCE.
In the wild rush to knock off work lately
pieference to unionists got badly trampled
on, and with Labor showing a great anxiety
to make one of its principles look as if it
had been in collision with a locomotive the
subsequent discovery that various other
people were ready to pay attention with a
sandbag to the remnants was merely an
appropriate part of the proceedings. The
subsequent deregistration of unions and
hurried cancellations under the War Pre-
cautions Act and refusals at various places
to give employment to “extremists” —all
these events were incidental to further dam-
age being inflicted on the doctrine the unions
had themselves commenced to assault and
batter. Wherefore when the organisations
most concerned began to take notice of the
wreckage m their tracks loud wails arose
on the breeze concerning a conspiracy to
give Labor the boot and to “destroy _ condi-
tions built up after years of effort,” and
uumerous officials spent their days expressing
great surprise that resistance should be
encountered to the claim of union members
for preferential treatment. All this may
perhaps be natural enough under the prevail-
ing circumstances; but while the unions are
whining about the iniquity of other people
it may do them no harm to think hard about
their own responsibility for what has hap-
pened to them. And when they come to
examine this question of preference their
main difficulty will be to convince them-
selves that the thing looks quite the same
as they thought it did before and to find
excuse for having changed its appearance.
* * * *
Now preference was either worth having
or it was not. If it was it certainly
demanded protection and the exercise of some
reasonable measure of care that in practice
its application to industry should jus-
tify the arguments by which the theory
of the arrangement was supported. The
ease for .preference has rested solely
upon the responsibility and the autho-
rity of the trade union. Where there
was collective bargaining and a number
of men through their organisation entered
into a compact relating- to conditions of
employment it was felt, first, that the
organisation could not justly be held
responsible unless all persons in the industry
were subject to the union's control, and,
secondly, that it would be a horrible injustice
to members of a union if individuals deriving
benefit from the union’s activities were not
obliged to share the cost of maintaining the
organisation and securing improved condi-
tions. All this, of course, sounded perfectly
fair. And it is fair. But there are two
sides to it, and though these have been
observed by some unions the number is
very small. Most unions have taken prefer-
ence as something dropped into their mouths
by a benevolent Providence, and either for-
gotten or refused to recognise not only the
obligation they were under to maintain the
case for preference but also the possibility
of proving the danger of the thing to the
unions themselves. This has led to member-
ship of a union being no test of personal
reliability, of readiness to participate in
the union’s affairs, of desire to be responsible
for any contract entered into by the union
as a collective body—of nothing other than
a willingness to pay a shilling or two every
week to a collector. It is not for this that
preference was ever thought of or granted.
* * * *
To grant preference of employment to
members of a union who, while having had
this preference, have by collective action
tossed the contract of which it was a part
into the dustbin and involved the com-
munity through which it made the compact
in enormous loss, would be a scandal. This
is so not because preference is in itself an
evil thing but because in a case of the kind
such a union would have given the strongest
possible proof that it was unworthy of a
good thing. There is no magic in a word.
Preference can be prostituted the same as
anything else. Justice may be polluted.
Parliaments may be corrupted. Neither of
these circumstances is any reason for admir-
ing injustice or sweeping Parliaments away
and establishing an autocracy on the vacant
allotments. So with preference to unionists.
A case can be made for it as strong as ever.
But no case can be made for permitting it
to be abused and turned into contempt, nor
any argument advanced to show that where
it has been placed in unworthy hands it
should be put there any more. To do so is
a degradation to the whole Labor movement.
A trade union or federation or whatever
else it may be is only part of the general
scheme of things. The community as a whole
is another and far more important part, and
no organisation, whatever it may be —no
single citizen—has a right to receive from
the community under the guise of justice a
charter of protection which it uses to assault
the people who gave it. Granting preference
to organisations which prove incapable of
using it properly is no proof that preference
is wrong any more than licensing chauffeurs
is shown to be undesirable because some
lunatic smashes himself up trying to set up
a new record round the corner. What it is
proof of is that, as with other matters relat-
ing to industrial agreements and awards,
unions, both of employees and employers,
should be bound by something strong enough
to make them stand by their engagements—
that a union which gets preference should
have solid reasons for not turning everything
said in defence thereof into material for jest.
No one ever suggested in Australia that
members of a union should be given prefer-
ence of employment in order that they might
prove the wisdom of the individuals who
foretold the failure of the experiment. It
was with very different intention that prefer-
ence was ever made possible. A union that
is without authority over itself and recog-
nises no responsibility to the' State has no
more right to preference than it has to free
meals.
THE PEACE-WITH-HATE
MOVEMENT.
If there is anything urgently demanding
repudiation by the Governments and people
of Australia it is the blither about the
allegedly fixed intention of the Common-
wealth to hereinafter and for all time ostra-
cise German trade. The yarn is dishonest
because it is untrue; mischievous because it
runs counter to the frequently-declared war
aims of the Allies; and even if it were none
of these things it reflects ideas impossible of
realisation. If the Allies were to win the
war, talk about commercially boycotting
millions of European people would be the
last word in futility. If they do not win,
the easiest way to provoke additional
trouble would be to try and tie the
German up by combinations formed for
the purpose of the boycott. If the
war ends with an all-iound face-saving
arrangement the prospects of peace being
maintained any longer thun may be neces-
sary to get ready for another disturbance
would, if policies of trade-frightfulness
found favor among the Kaiser’s enemies, be
less than the chance of the war ending next
week. And it happens at this stage of the
proceedings that the boss u n could wish
for nothing better than that he should be
able to quote speeches delivered in other
countries in support of his allegation that
the object of the Allies is to throttle the
economic life and freedom of the Fatherland.
The resolutions passed at the Paris Confer-
ence played right into the hands of the
German war party. Within a week the pro-
posals were as dead as mutton everywhere
except in Berlin. Either the Allies are
fighting to destroy a military autocracy, so
that the people of Europe may live in peace,
or they are not. If they were, they are
waging a holy war. If they were shedding
blood like water merely in order that they
might trample on a people—if they are
struggling to free the Germans from the
yoke of Ivaiserdom for the purpose of impos-
ing upon them an exterior tyranny, then, in
that case, the war is a mockery, the fight
for democracy a jest.
The quarrel of the peoples whose soldiers
are fighting the German armies is not with
the Germans. It is with a monstrous
political system, which makes peace impos-
sible. The point at issue is whether autoc-
racy or democracy shall endure —whether
there shall lie freedom of government and of
citizenship, not only in Belgium and here in
Australia but in Germany. So long as
Prussianism prevails in Central Europe there
can be no peace, no safety. Even if it were
swept away there could be no peace if the
German found himself with his neck under
another boot. Recognition of this is
reflected in every sentence of President Wil-
son’s message to Congress and in all the
later utterances of men who count in other
countries. The wilder talk of a year or tw T o
ago, when men and newspapers blathered
about “wiping out,” etc.—when they exuded
bombast bearing a close resemblance to the
shouts from beyond the Rhine —has an odd
sound these days. Yet at every convenient
opportunity that uncertain petrel IV. M.
Hughes lifts up his voice in the old strain
and announces that when the allied armies
have done their work Germany is going to
be commercially side-tracked and restricted
to a diet of general wretchedness. Hughes,
harping on this subject last week, laid down
the~law with his kind of emphasis—Germany
would get nothing from Australia.
* * * *
Now, The Bulletin is not particularly
anxious to see Germany acquiring raw
material from the Commonwealth, nor to
discover Australia importing from Hamburg.
What it is anxious about is that Austra-
lians shall not lose sight of the crux of their
problems by being deluded about irrelevan-
cies. That immense economic difficulties
are being manufactured by war is obvious
enough, but at rock-bottom these do not
differ from those that were already on the
premises when the war began. They have
only changed in size. The economic lessons
of the war are just the same old lessons
printed in bigger type and uttered with
louder voice. To Australia they emphasise this :
That the business of the people hereabouts
is to do their own job and not depend on
it being attended to by other people, whether
they are Germans or anything else. It
would avail Australia nothing if someone
took the place of Fritz as a customer for
wool or apples or copper. It would be no
advantage to refuse to purchase glassware
from Dresden and send the orders to Tierra-
del-Fuego. And it would be worse than sui-
cidal to expect either material or moral gain
from truculently announcing to people
rescued from a mediaeval oppression that they
were outside the pale of commercial rela-
tionship. If is made with autocratic
Germany it can only be on a basis which
will leave no room for such conduct by the
rest of the world as Hughes dreams about.
If a democratised Germany comes into the
scheme of nations there would be still less.
In neither case would the contract Australia
has always had on hand be then different
from what it was yesterday. It is by roll-
ing up our sleeves instead of rolling our
tongues about it that this will be mastered.
By minding our own business, by running
our own factories and mines, developing our
scientific and technical skill, by doing for
ourselves what we_ were paying the German
to do. Australia will get through. There is
no other way.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Democracy, as in Maoriland.
The insolence of elected persons is pro-
verbial. But though Australia has had
innumerable illustrations of the inflated
complacency with which the person who
emerges from a ballot-box regards himself, it
would have to admit the claim of Maoriland
to more calamitous experience in this par-
ticular direction. And there is something
almost poetic in the circumstance that a
man like Joe Ward should afford the latest
and most deplorable reminder of the politi-
cian’s ineradicable dislike of popular control
and impudent assumption of superiority to
it. There has been some talk over yonder
lately about the propriety of Parliament
dodging a general election, and, referring to
this subject the other day, Ward, if the
cable isn’t a liar, delivered himself thus: —
All efforts should be centred on prosecution of the
war—not on distracting the people’s attention and
wasting the money an election would cost. Anyone
wanting an election now ought to be hanged.
This is in the best strain of the suburban
greengrocer who, having just been elected
mayor, solemnly pledges himself to have the
local footpaths repaired, and denounces the
Public Health inspector who recommended
the destruction of slums as a dangerous
firebrand. War or no war the Maoriland
Parliament has not a shadow of moral right
for depriving the people of their constitu-
tional authority to exercise the franchise.
The Parliament now sitting has made many
material alterations in the law. It has sanc-
tioned financial obligations that will pro-
foundly affect the life of the community. It
has levied most burdensome taxation, and by
refusing the people the right of reviewing
what has been done Parliament outrages the
very first principle of self-government, and
every time a Minister mouths about “the war
now being waged in defence of democracy” he
stands convicted of being a humbug. * De-
mocracy is good or bad; but it is not for
politicians in a democratic community to say
that it is only good sometimes or to deny
the opportunity to function. There is no
reason to suppose that people who want to
take part in government do not want to
“prosecute the war.” If there was, Ward
would be in the position of carrying on in
defiance of the popular wish. The trouble
is that the M.D. Ministry, born of a frowsv
Party deal, is looked on with grave distrust
by a large section of the community. There
is no enthusiasm for it anywhere. The
mass of the people have by the financial
sohemings of Massey and Ward been given
a deal too raw almost for credence. Where-
fore it is easier to gabble about “prosecut-
ing the war” and to take refuge behind
“patriotism” than to face the ballot-box
Which is statesmanship—of a kind.
Whisky, Uiiimited.
“Pat O’Maori” whirls an incoherent bottle:
When the war ends the nations will require a
drink. All else may be in doubt; but in spite of
aeroplane, submarine, shell-shock, peace conventions,
Rule Britannia, the Kaiser, Kerensky, Billy
Hughes and others, the thirst of the war-weary
world must be taken as a great human fact.
Moreover, it is the kind of fact which the general
beer-restriction and anti-vodka efforts can only accen-
tuate. A hundred thousand umbrellas may wave
their protest and a million reform voices lift their
dry chorus of alcoholic hate to the stars; but
the universal pub will gurgle a song of such alluring
sweetness that perforce the universal boot must
follow to the fountains of joy. There is always a
divine philosophy in these things. Hard coercion
yields to the pressure of the desire for gladness or
its best substitute; and when the work that made
you grit your teeth is done the relaxation that bids
you wet your throat follows like the sun after the
rain-squall. No laws, regulations, orders, votes,
preachings or other flimsy devices of the world-
improver can have any effect in staying the march
of a triumphant and hard-won thirst; and the best
thing that wise statecraft can do about it is to
accept the grand fact and get ready to meet it in a
spirit of broad and genial philosophy. -The coming
thirst is ours to use and turn to highest moral and
economic purpose. Australia is by a lucky accident
complete master of a stupendous situation which can
turn world-revelry into great national achievement.
On all sides is our accumulated harvest of grain,
with more harvest to follow; and the mouse-millions
of destruction are breeding up with great enthusiasm
to eat what was intended for the good of men. To
produce crops merely to feed mice does not strike
the philosopher as a high form of pastime even in
a country dependent on primary production; but the
golden key of a problem which looks too difficult for
all the ships available in the world to solve is found
in a single sentence. Shake up the wheels of
industry; mice do not eat whisky.
Before the war Australia stood to the world as a
great source of food supply; but the big guns have
blown new notions into the minds of the nations
and tremendous efforts are being made to grow the
wheat and cabbage necessary to keep the wolf out
of the dining-room in the national back yard. Big
buyers of breadstuffs, who in the past always looked
to getting a large part of their provender from over-
seas, are likely to be very small buyers in the near
future. The trend of opportunity ought to be very
clear to the Australian thinker. Man cannot live
by bread alone; but the war has forced the nations
to consider bread—and home-grown bread at that —as
the first essential of nationhood. There will be little
time to make the wine or brew the beer or distil the
brandy while the wheat is being taught to grow in
strange places to feed the hungry millions; but
Australia, wise in the psychology of the race and
knowing the extent of world-thirst, can turn to the
great business of making its abounding grain harvests
into whisky. In a word, Australia, ceasing to be
the world’s grain-store, can at a single bound become
the world’s pub. Starting with the coming harvest
and working overtime at the national pot-still, there
will be time for the first ocean of delight to mature
before the full thirst is let loose. Then from the
Urals to Portugal, and fr- n Sicily to the Arctic
Circle, the word will go forth that floods and lake-
of choice spirit are on tap at the Antipodes, and
that there alone is the great plenty which can suppl.'
all human needs. The sign of the Southern Cross
will wave over the entrance to the Bar of Mankind,
a sign to send a thrill of hope to the breast of every
earnest seeker. London may be dry as a lime-kiln,
Petrograd dreary as a dust-heap; but the lip s 0I "
humanity will smack over the very name of Sydney,
and the saddest and most despondent soul tossed up
by the waves of the great war on the joyless strand
of sobriety will look towards Melbourne as the Mecca
of his most riotous dreams.
But the sound statesmanship of such a proposal
must not be missed any more than its high altruistic
motive. No national ambition can be higher than
that of supplying the world with delight and refresh-
ing it after its tremendous efforts in the cause o
civilisation ; but if in carrying that great ambition
to its noblest height Australia can also secure "hat
is most needed for the development of an empt.'
continent, the double achievement would mark ati
epoch in the story of the race. Above all things "c
need population. Who doubts that population would
follow the golden sources of honest liquor? T®
call of the pub has been strangely missed by most
The Sun is Rising in the West.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a legend that when Ludh led forth the
Children of Light from Connaught to the conquest
of the Powers of Darkness, they saw him in his
shining armor and cried that the sun was rising in
the west.
The sun is rising in the west!
* Sing for the march of splendid light!
The hopes that trembled in the night,
The clouded dreams that could not rest
Are clad in armor shining white.
The sun is rising in the west!
The sun is rising in the west!
To rebel hosts the trumpets peal.
The standards of the darkness reel.
The eager thought, no more opprest,
Breaks from the bondage of their steel,
The sun is rising in the west!
The sun is rising in the west!
Forget the wailing of the song,
The fitful music dying long
To echoes of an aching breast.
The chant of mornings march is strong.
The sun is rising in the west!
The sun is rising in the west!
The world turns back. No hour is lost.
No scaffold-shadow darkly crost
A tomb with scornful ivy drest.
Count not the blood-spent ages’ cost—
The sun is rising in the west!
The sun is rising in the west!
We kept the faith through blinding tears.
We smote the darkness of the years
That made our souls their mocking jest.
O hearts triumphant o’er their fears,
The sun is rising in the west!
The sun is rising in the west!
New glory shines on land and sea.
The loud dream-horns of victory
Shrill that the timeless, martyred best
Of all the years is yet to be.
The sun is rising in the west!

historians in tracing vast movements of population;
but the evidences are that it played a stupendous
part in shaking thrones and stirring the bases of
empires. The southward drift of the Gauls, for in-
stance, which so greatly affected Romo, can be
explained in only one way. These people in their
' o-allant thousands poured through the passes of the
lips ready to fight anything that came in their way,
but apparently with no immediate desire to make
settlements. They were not drawn to Italy by land-
hunger or racial hate or any of the other usual
causes of invasion; and the fact that they struck
terror into the hearts of all who dared to cross
6words with them is proof enough that they could
have had the whole box-of-tricks from Etruria to
Sicily, if they had cared to take it. As a plain
fact, these merry campaigners and dashing warriors
were merely visiting the pub. The wine of Italy
was the lure; and the trouble of Rome, which they
sacked without much fuss, was that it lay in the way
of the saloon bar. The chances are that a similar
thirst provoked the ruder Goths and Vandals of a
later age in their descent on the lands near the
Mediterranean; and on all evidences the appetite of
the races of mankind for liquid refreshment is in as
good working order to-day as it was 22 centuries
ago. Given the same chance, the wild, fine spirits
of every land would pour again towards the source
of alcohol and history’s old trick of repetition would
be displayed. Of course there would be a difference.
The Australian pub, with its boundless bead on the
universal flagon, would not be raided by dashing
horsemen shouting for all hands on the credit of a
dripping sword. Our triumph would lie in the cheap-
ness of the liquor we could supply. Fine old
whisky, without trace or suspicion of chemical aid,
at fourpence a gallon or thereabout would melt the
heart of the fiercest warrior that ever pushed a spear.
Our raiders would come to us in utter friendship,
jingling the coins of peace instead of the armor of
hate; and in the vast charity of our endeavor to
elevate the spirits of a despondent world we would
wear on the lips of all men the forgotten title of
Most Christian Nation.
The opportunity for practical statesmanship here
offered is one which a Napoleon would have grasped
with avidity. Between the mice and the war-
changes we stand a chance of falling to the ground
with a particularly violent thud. Our accounts
are overdrawn; our resources appear to be diminish-
ing. Good investors with a sharp eye on the future
are leaving real estate alone and putting their
cash into war loan. But the value of a war-loan
investment can only be the value of the country’s
remaining credit. Why not push the pseudo-
reformer aside, break his umbrella over his noisy
propaganda, and boldly enter as a nation into the
wider places and larger profits of the booze trade?
We can make the whisky from our grain, the casks
from the timber of our forests, the bottles from
our drifting sands; and if there is no substitute to
be found for cork, it stands at least to the credit of
that material that it is the lightest of all our imports
and the one least subject to shipwreck. There is
a job here in perpetuity for the grain grower, a
job for the bushman, a job for the cooper who
carves the staves of the barrels, a job for the bottle-
maker and bottle-washer, a job for every dimpled
lass who can work a welcoming smile and fill a
glass—in fact, there is a job for everybody at
highest wages and with no possible failure of em-
ployment. And against all this prospect of pros-
perity and glowing hope of overflowing popu-
lation and national development there stands a
single barrier —the awful fear that whisky might
intoxicate. Of course it might. So might love
and poetry and patriotism and all the big things
of which we know. Is it not a fact that we
describe all these things in terms of liquor? Was
not Jove, the god of all orcrir and civic law, in the
clean first days of Rome the god of booze also ?
Did not the thoughtful Greeks combine under the
care of one deity the ideas of civilisation and wine?
Out on the anti-Australian that would push a dull
fad against the hope of national progress! Oppor-
tunity calls us to the bar, and the splendid future
of the South must be written, not in blood, but in
wine.

Anoth< r Dodge.
When John Storey, leader of the N. S.
Wales State Labor Party, in the Legislative
Assembly the other night publicly examined
the holes and dents in the national cashbox,
he did something which ought to be done
more frequently ; but when it came to sug-
gesting a method by which additional dam-
age to the receptacle might be prevented
he made a recommendation of about as much
value as a bunch of parsnips. Here it is:—
It is obvious that the responsibilities of the
Treasurer’s office should be shared by a permanent
officer, highly trained and highly paid, who should
act the part of mentor or monitor to the Treasurer.
He should be appointed under statute, and hold an
ex officio standing in the deliberations of the
Cabinet in all matters connected with the finances
and their administration.
The cold fact is that the State already lias
multitudinous permanent officers wffio are
the mentors and monitors of Ministers. To
add to these would merely mean increasing
the pay-roll and getting nothing in return
except a few additional yards of Bed Tape.
Storey missed the crux of the whole busi-
ness. If his case were that money was dis-
honestly spent, that it was recklessly got
rid of or that the departmental administra-
tion was incapable of protecting the public
from official extravagance it would only be
necessary to establish the facts in order to
have an unanswerable argument for arming
the Auditor-General with wider powers. Un-
fortunately this is not Storey’s case. Wliat
he complains of is the muddling of Govern-
ment and the impoverishment of the State
by profligate financial policies year after
year. To say that the appointment ot
another permanent official to share the
responsibilities of the Treasurer offers any
hope of a cure for this is to mock
at public intelligence. Parliament is
alone responsible for what Ministers do. It
could surround Ministers with battalions of
officials, yet if the Ministry was. inept,
or corrupt or improvident and Parliament
sanctioned wild-cat expenditure, chased votes
with Appropriation Bills and squandered the
taxpayers’ earnings and credit, the accumu-
lation of officialdom would give the public
loss protection than a vanished umbrella on
a wet day. The truth is that by the prosti-
tution of representative government to
Party custody of the cashbox has been torn
from elected assemblies and becomes vested
hi the hands of Cabinet, so that there is no
such thing as parliamentary control of the
communal dollars or the operating gang.
It is so all over the world. In Australia, it
18 not too much to say that Ministries
exercise an authority over revenues and credit
as complete as that the Pharaohs were
accustomed to. Until Parliaments rid them-
selves of the incubus of Party-constructed
Ministries —-until they resume their rights of
control and make Ministries their servants
instead of their masters —Governments will
be wasteful and dangerous. It is not to offici-
aldom that Parliament must look to see
public policy rescued from the abyss. It must
depend on its own honesty and sense of
responsibility to the people. When it fails
in this respect the sooner the electors fire it
out the better.

The Armor-plated Hides in Om- Midst.
Of course if an Australian politician comes
to the conclusion that he is a superfluity
in his own country he has at least a plau-
sible reason for being anxious to get out of
it- But it seems to this paper that such
an individual would be giving himself a
fairer deal if, as a preliminary, he knocked
off drawing salary from the Treasury. Pub-
lic men in Australia are paid for attending
to the local job. It is no part of the con-
tract that they should appropriate cash for
attending to the business of another coun-
try. Wherefore it can be assumed that
when Davy Hall and Crawford Vaughan,
of the N. S. Wales and S.A. State fusions,
flit away .to Canada, in order, as it is
described in the daily papers, to “take part
in the Conscription fight,” they will cease
taking pay for holding down portfolios at
this end of the world. It is no part of
their business to go butting into Canadian
affairs, unless they go as private patriots at
their own expense. Whether they have been
“invited” to do so or not has nothing to do
with the matter. Provided they can get
passports there can be no objection to them
trying their luck on the stump over yonder
without official status. For them to go as
Ministers, still taking pay from Australian
taxpayers, would be a piece of stupendous
cheek. If a couple of provincial politicians
arrived in Australia to lecture the people
hereabouts on their duties as citizens they
would certainly be regarded as undesirable
emigrants. And in any case the spectacle
of Hall, who has been tremblingly express-
ing great anxiety that Hughes shall keep
the compulsory military service issue firmly
in the grave, wildly racing about Winnipeg
on snowshoes, delivering orations about a
subject, of which the mere mention in Aus-
tralia had sent him bolting into a funk hole,
would be a hilarious revelation of how wars
may be won.

Shell Shock and the Treatment of
Mental Cases.
The observations of “Nux Vomica” :
That the Law is primarily responsible for making
difficult the adequate treatment of shell-shock and
other nervous and incipient mental cases in no way
exempts the medical profession from blame in the
matter. The profession is secondarily responsible in
that, as it were, it has allowed the case to go by
default. Conversation with a returned major of the
A.A.M.C. on hospital-ship duty elicited the very in-
teresting fact that he did not treat any of the cases
of shell-shock that happened to be on board —he
did not understand them, so he left them to his
orderly! Presumably if he had not had any artery
forceps with him at the dressing station he would
have left the limbs to be amputated by a soldier
with a trenching tool!
“Q.E.D.,” writing to The Bulletin, shows that
it is obviously the classification of germs that makes
it necessary to invoke the law in some cases of
delirium. That a patient delirious as the result of
a classified poison should be regarded as a sick per-
son and treated by hospital methods even though he
resists, while another, equally ill, who is delirious
and resistive as the result of an unclassified poison,
should be dealt with by law, like a criminal, is surely
one of the wonders of modern medicine.
Hippocrates, Galen and other ancient writers
recognised insanity as an illness, and that it was
necessary to treat it on the same lines as other ill-
nesses. It was not until about the end of the 13th
century that the treatment of mental disturbance
began to be alienated from the practice of general
medicine, and the insane to be imprisoned. At that
time it was the custom to regard all illness as a
“visitation of God,” and recovery was looked upon
as an evidence of Divine intervention. Now the
medical profession evidently is agreed that only
mental illness should be so distinguished. Oddly
enough, it resorts to cleanliness rather than prayer
in the prevention of typhoid, but shifts the responsi-
bility of the neuropath on to Providence, forget-
ting that an increasing insane rate is even more
naturally suicidal than a decreasing birth-rate. The
community loses the national value of each insane
person, and, in addition, is taxed for his support.
School children are taught that “the brain is the
most important organ in the body.” Medical students
know better than to take the brain seriously, for does
not their training omit any teaching on the subject
except theoretically ? It would be conceded, of course,
that the brain is (theoretically) equal in importance
to the liver, and even (theoretically) as interesting as
the vermiform appendix. That such a concession is purely
formal, however, would be abundantly demonstrated
the moment the brain became involved as a compli-
cation with either disease. The patient would imme-
diately receive less medical care rather than more
because of the complication; and the physician would
be quite willing to have the law take the responsi-
bility of the case off his hands —presumably because
it had become too difficult for medicine to deal with.
This shocking condition is subscribed to, not only
through indifference on the part of the general
public, but by acquiescence on the part of the
medical profession, who recognise that such handi-
caps in regard to mental troubles should not exist —
and, meekly allow, them to yo on existing!
Sale of Titles.
Queen Eliza, of the rosy locks and imperi-
ous will, made titles of nobility scarce gifts
and invested common knighthood with a
sort of glamor through the rarity with
which she tapped deserving persons with
the sword. James 1., who followed, reversed
the order of things and sold spectacular
name-handles as cheaply as the condition of
the treasury would permit. Knights were
as common as inkpots, and the crop of
soap-boilers who became barons went 60
bushels to the acre. The result was seen
in the succeeding reign when the netv
nobility, glittering in satin and velvet and
with scented hair half a yard long, took the
field for the King against the Parliament
and backed up every sham of the
Stuart rule with lance and sabre. But the
people of England knew that the titled per-
son didn’t amount to much; and from the
time when James began to barter his gew-
gaws . for coin hereditary aristocracy in
Britain has been more or less in contempt.
Writing of the sale-of-titles debate in the
House of Commons, S. M. Herald’s London
correspondent hurls this bouquet at the sys-
tem of party government:—
We would need to be both fools and blind to
associate the titles worn by many of our contem-
poraries with any distinction whatever of intellect or
value of work done. It is, of course, a disgraceful
business; but while there are political parties there
must be party funds, and there must consequently
be aids to the extraction of surplus wealth. The
offer of a title is a simple operation, and the rest
is as easy.
But where exactly does the disgrace come
in? Nobody whose opinion really mattered
has for two centuries or more associated
title necessarily with intellect or achieve-
ment; and party and aristocracy, for both
of which the S.M.H. has always stood solidly,
are about equally valuable to the nation. If
party is worth while it is surely better that
titled nonentities should pay for it than that
if should be a charge on the people. The
whole thing is of a price, and a good demo-
crat who despises the hereditary aristocracy
notion could ask for nothing better than
that the number of titles sold should be so
increased that the meanest-spirited person
of all would be dubious of wearing one. It
seems a pity that anyone should interfere
with a business that if left alone must
destroy both party and peerage.
“0.K.”: As a first precaution against the
danger of another general strike an Act
to control newspaper reports and cross-
headings is urgently required. Strikes, as
far as I can understand, are pretty much
what the daily press makes them, by inflam-
matory comment, suggestion, supposition,
“interview” and innuendo. The first incen-
tive to a disastrous strike is a hysterical
statement of its appalling dangerousness.
Ignorant, unreasoning workers are deluded
by cross-headings into the belief that em-
ployers must pay anything rather than per-
mit the wheels of industry to stop. If the
actual design of the Tory press is to puff
certain unions up with a sense of their poten-
tiality for mischief, those journals couldn’t
work harder to do it. And when the strike is
an accomplished fact all the power of the
press is employed to give the strike leaders
swelled head. The leading Australian
dailies help to light the fire in the
first place and then act as pot-boiler,
never as a prudent public servant
trying to pour cold water on the fire. This
last industrial upheaval reminded me of
Chief Justice Madden’s bearing on the Vic-
torian engine-drivers’ mistake of 14 years
ago. The engine-driver's were reasonable
enough until Madden took the chair at an
annual dinner of the Union. Madden, want-
ing scope for his itching eloquence, talked
at large of the awful Power which his flat-
tered hearers held. He painted a picture
of the dire results that must ensue from a
strike of men whose mission in life was to
curry the commerce of the country over the
broad acres of enterprise, and so forth. By
the time the orator had finished his appeal
to the vanity of his hearers they felt that
they were collectively It, and must take an
early opportunity to put their possibilities
into practice.

“C.F.E.” writes of the hookworm, Austra-
lia’s new danger:—
The hookworm is transmitted through the excreta
of infected persons, and under tropical conditions
breeds out and waits for the barefooted native to
continue the circle. The booted human runs less
risk of infection; nevertheless the worm gets a home
in the white man in other ways and more often than
is supposed. The case I have most in mind is my
own. When I was surveyor to a mine on the Gold Coast,
W. Africa, I was nearly outed by the pest. Some
infected negroes had fouled the mine, and cuts on
the hands while measuring sfopes gave the entry for
the parasite. At that time I had been on the Coast
foi eight months, and had never heard mention made
of the hookworm. During that period many men
had been invalided and some subsequently died. As
these were all underground men, I often wondered
afterwards whether the English doctors had not failed
to recognise the symptoms.
Yet it seems an easy illness to cure if it is recog-
nised and fought. The Tamil coolies on estates in
Ceylon are either mostly sick of or recovering from
the disease. The weekly inspection of the estate I
engineered at a later date always showed a majority
of the laborers to be infected. They would willingly
take the first course of medicine; but the tonic,
being bitter, was not to their liking. In fact, it
was a regular occurrence for the estate watchman
to round up the sufferers and stand on guard while
they had their tonic poured down their gullets.
If cases get bad and have to go into nopital, then
caste becomes a real obstacle. Tamil estate labor
belongs to the lower castes; but even among these
there are the lower, lowest and extremely horrible.
The State hospital—usually a large, airy build-
ing—contains only two wards, male and female.
But many a patient would rather die than partake
of the same food with a lower-caste patient. It
is a problem estate managers have to face. I once
saw a lady sneaking through the tea plantation near
the estate hospital. I called for her to come near.
She was a very bad case of ankylostomia. She
explained that she, being of a higher caste than the
ether inmates, couldn’t permit their shadow to con-
taminate her. She eventually died of hookworm.
The sale to the British Government of
30,000 tons of butter will certainly make
things easier in cow circles during the next
few months. It will mean the distribution
of about four and a half millions sterling in
the dairying districts, and the price, 151 s. a
cwt. f.0.b., is a good, solid, profitable one.
Not many weeks ago, seeing the difficulty of
transport and that butter was placed sixth
on the list of necessaries by the Imperial
Government, there were more than indica-
tions in the cow industry of blue funk as to
what was going to happen to the surplus
grease usually exported. Prospect of possible
serious loss has turned to sure and fair profit,
and some may reckon the cow cocky is on a
very good wicket and “making money out of
the war.” Well, the British Government is
not doing too bad. Butter is scarce on the
other side, and a few weeks ago the
Danish article, what could be got of
it, was selling in Manchester at 300 s.
a cwt. Canadian or American butter
could not be landed in the U.K. at less than
2205. to 2405., and the article is selling
nowadays in Vancouver at 2s. 3d. a lb.
What is more to the point, the Maoriland
Government has asked Bull Is. 7d. a lb.
and it has a large part of last
season’s output still on hand. In addi-
tion to a good price the Australian cow
cocky is obtaining a unique chance, and it
will be his own fault if it isn’t worth a lot
of coin to him in the future. For the first
time the whole of his exnort will
go on to the British market as Aus-
tralian butter, by arrangement. It will
not, as in the past, be snapped up by
blenders and fakers and worked in with other
stuff, entirely losing its identity. Most of
our best product has never got a chance
to prove itself with the English consumer,
whose decision too often was based on
inferior stuff which damned the whole repu-
tation of Australian fat. Compulsory grad-
ing, the system which made M.L. butter, will
block inferior stuff being passed off as first
(all exports will be graded and be under
strict supervision), and our best will be
sold as “Australian” all the time. It is up to
the cocky and all concerned to put out the
real goods and to establish a reputation
abroad that will help to capture the Danish
business and assist Australia generally.
Somewhat late in the day comes the promise
that the British Government will “probe”
the work of the various Peace organisations
in England. There are 50 of them, and one
has been spending £60,000 a year on its
printing alone. With the revelations from
Norway, Sweden and America, and finally
the 8010 scandal in France to spur them
into action, Lloyd George and Co. could
no longer cock a blind eye at the direct or
indirect pro-Germans in England. A secret-
service inquiry no doubt will disclose in
many cases the working of the same system
of bribery and corruption that flourished in
America and elsewhere. The notion that
England, with its 30,000 uninterned Ger-
mans and its multitude of other “neutral”
aliens, could remain immune from the ex-
periences of other nations was ridiculous.
When is Australia going to get a searchlight
on its enemy friends?
♦
“Arsenate” : We have interned a few, but
we’re idiotically easy with pro-llun Germans
dwelling among us. Early in the war the
authorities went after a German officer,
“visiting” Australia. He ducked to Tas-
mania, as a ship’s fireman. Thence he
slipped to Victoria. Again the Department
got on his track, and one day a posse called
at an orchard in the Doncaster hills, where
a nice little wireless plant had started sing-
ing. An officer stepped to the front door
and asked for Mr. (say) Schmidt. A girl,
a daughter of the house, assured him that
no one of that name lived there. “Sure
you’re got no employee of that name?” “No,
quite certain.” “Well, I’ll have to make a
search.” At that the damsel slammed the
door, sprinted through the house, and, when
the officer got round the back, was yelling in
German to three men working across a
gully. Instantly one of the three snatched
up his coat and bolted for Bourke or Ber-
lin ; but as he hit the road a stern-looking
stranger with a revolver met him, and he
went into “camp.” Recently, at this Ger-
man’s place, I met two employees who could
hardly make themselves understood. Both
passionately denied the Fatherland, and
started yodelling to prove how Swiss they
w r ere. Other Germans in the district seem to
have an unlimited supply of newchum Ger-
man employees. Whence com§ they?
“Toxin” : Dr. W. J. Penfold, director of
the Commonwealth serum laboratories, gives
further disproof of the vicious doctrine that
Australia cannot possibly manufacture any-
thing for herself. Up to the present we
have imported all our sera and vaccines from
Europe or America, and long sea voyages
do these delicate products no good. More-
over, we have had to take their original
purity and potency on trust, and results have
not been wanting' to show that this confi-
dence in foreign commercial scientists may
be misplaced. The new laboratories of the
Quarantine Department are designed to
manufacture all the serums and vaccines
likely to be required in Australasia for some
time to come, and also to carry out bac-
teriological examinations required by quar-
antine work. Serums against diphtheria,
tetanus, dysentery, cerebro-spinal menin-
gitis, streptococcal infections, and perhaps
pneumo-coccal infections, together with
vaccine lymph and other vaccines, will con-
stitute the principal output at the
beginning. Later, it is probable that
research will be added to the func-
tions of the laboratories. The pro-
ducts will be placed at the disposal of
local medical men, in competition with the
imported article, but without the necessity
for heavy profits which determines the price
of the latter. One particularly useful pro-
duct will be luetin, which is of extreme value
in diagnosing latent syphilis. The labora-
tories are now under construction and will
embody such requirements as the supply of
sterile air to the rooms where the serums
are bottled, and provide elaborate precau-
tions against dust. Dr. Tenfold comes
from the Lister Institute, of which the
director is Dr. Martin, formerly of the
Sydney and Melbourne Universities.. No
applicant of Australian origin could be
found with the requisite experience, but a
course of training under “Plugger Bill.”
the name by which Martin is affectionately
remembered by several University genera-
tions of Australian doctors, will have gone
very near to producing the dinkum article.
As an illustration of comparative values in
the political mind, it is interesting to note
that this highly-trained medical scientist, in
charge of an undertaking which is of vital
importance to Australia, will receive a salary
of £650, rising by degrees to £750, or about
the same income as can be made by any
raw young medico in a backblock town. To
say nothing of the salaries in the Defence
Dept., starting with Pearce.

The Struggle with the Lid of a Pill-box.
It can be taken as reasonably certain that
the assault launched against the German
east of Ypres represents something in the
nature of the heaviest wallop the armies
thereabouts were capable of delivering at
the point of attack. Long experience has
shown that it is useless to punch with any-
thing but the maximum of available force.
And in this instance the attack was made
for a purpose so vital to the Allies as to
demand the strongest possible effort being
made to secure success. Their aim has
been to break the German grip on Western
Flanders, and though it is true that sub-
stantial advance in that direction had been
made up to the beginning of the week, it is
no less true that the attack had met with
very solid resistance, and that what was
going to happen when the battle raged among
the innards of the defensive system had not
been settled. The main point about it all
up to the time of writing seems to be the
emphasis placed by the struggle upon the
magnitude of the job. All these decorative
yarns about scared German prisoners and
enemy wastage and the lowered morale of
the troops can be put aside as mere trim-
mings. The test of the thing is whether
the German defence can be cracked. And
until there is definite evidence of it going-
bung there is the soundest proof that the
difference of opinion concerning pill-boxes
and dug-outs in Belgium has not been
settled. The sudden transformation of the
countryside into a sea of mud heavily handi-
caps the assaulting armies. In the mean-
time the occasional glimpses of the
Bear are of a badly-dishevelled animal, and
the activities of the German in the Gulf of
Riga seem the prelude to happenings which
are unpleasant to think about. To go on with
the Allies may take what cheerfulness they
can from the occurrences in the Kaiser’s
navy. These seem to have been serious
matters, and even if allowance be made for
exaggeration there is no getting away from
it that when the crew of a battleship tosses
the skipper overboard, hoists the Red Flag
and tries to reach the free sea, there is
something to consider. The riot may merely
be the inevitable result of keeping a navy
tied up at the wharf. It may be only a
wild longing to get out and hit something.
In any case it may induce the Emperor to
give his fleet more to do than stay at home
—which should be interesting to all hands.
A sour Anglo-Indian :
When will the dear, kind English lady learn that
the Australian soldier isn’t a kid at a Sunday-school
treat? Three wireless Billjims on a month’s fur-
lough in Calcutta drove round in a taxi to the War
Gift Dep6t. The dame in charge offered them a
tram-ticket each to go for a ride, and brought along
a book to sign for them. She was greatly aston-
ished and rather offended when the visitors politely
declined the free-for-all ride and departed in their
taxi. Later on, the fair at Government House
benefited to the extent of £2O through the Three
Musketeers trying their luck in raffles and other
alluring swindles.
There are still some overlanders left.
After putting in a couple of years with a
sawmilling plant near Narracoorte (S.A.),
Burt and Timms decided to get after the tim-
ber at Narbethong (Vic.), 400 miles away.
So they fixed their portable engine on
wheels, loaded the machinery and gear into
nine waggons, put 50 good horses on to the
lot and started across country.
Maoriland Reps, having by a heavy
majority declared for sealing up the pub at
sundown, Stiggins and Co. were last heard
from wildly demanding that a complete job
be made of the* business by rolling all the
hogsheads off the premises into the sea. Bung
contemplates the hogshead with gloomy fore-
bodings. It certainly looks as if the time
when extract of hops and malt in M.L. will
be but a joyous memory is within measur-
able distance. In the interval of waiting
while Bung and Stiggins are trying to
strangle one another the foolishness of not
allowing public control to get a hearing is
an impressive circumstance. Maoriland
politicians, partly because of their anxiety
to serve the booze monopolists and in a
measure because of their desire not to in-
furiate Chadband, have always dodged
allowing the community any alternative
between the bar and the water-waggon. As
the brewer and the waggoner are not the
only people with an interest in the subject,
there’s a chance now that the majority will
arise and say a wrnrd or two.
W. H. Douglass: A writer in a recent
Bulletin mentions the finding of the pede-
stal for the model of the original Vic. Eight-
Hours’ monument under the stage of the old
Trades Hall in Melbourne. The pedestal
was designed by the late Peter Kerr, archi-
tect, and was constructed by me. By the
way, the original deeds of the hall are still
in the possession of the executors of my late
father, Ben Douglass.
FIELDS OF FRANCE.
[For The Bulletin.]
A message from Paris states that the French
harvest is the poorest for a half-century. The Food
Minister proposes a scheme of rationing towns. One
hundred and forty million bushels of cereals must be
imported.
O Fields of France, whence, in one indrawn breath,
Swept forth a wave of manhood edged with steel
To meet the wild, inrushing tide of Death
And smash it into bloody foam, we kneel
In homage to the soil wherefrom they sprang
To fight their hour for France and seek their rest
From the loud fight where shell on gun-shield rang
In the dark sanctuary of her breast.
O Fields of France! O fair and gracious fields!
What dole of bread is this you give your sons 1....
“All that I have! All that my scarred breast yields
While rolls the thunder of the German guns!
Close to my grieving heart I hold them all,
My valorous children who will fight no more.
France mourns her dead 1 Tell that to all who call
Aloud for bread! Then empty my poor store.”
N.s.w. K.
As a preliminary to Vic. State elec-
tions next month Premier Peacock with-
held his Budget from the Assembly until last
week in order that the session might
expire without unnecessary discussion.
Like other Treasurers Peacock resolutely
objects to the fact that there is a war going
on or to notice how tight a place the State
that he is supposed to manage is getting
into. He sidesteps airily, maunders about
the drought that has passed and of the good
seasons to come, and trusts to a bewildered
community to set him up at the old address
once more. Peacock, held in office mainly by
grace of the Opposition, and blindly drifting
towards something mighty like an interview
with the bailiff, is about as pathetic a fowl
as the roost by the Yarra has produced for
some days.
John Howie, who passed out at Katoomba
(N.S.W.) lately, was the foreman builder
of the superstructure and tower of Sydney
G.P.O. in the early ’eighties. He was born
in 1850 at Glasgow, where he served his
time as a stonemason, and afterwards
worked in U.S.A. for some years. He came
to Australia in 1879, and his first job was
on additions to the Ma State’s Government
House. After a spell as clerk of works in
the Government Architect’s office he started
as a builder on his own. Some of his chief
work is embedded in Sydney Art Gallery,
the Naval Stores at Garden Island and the
Harbor Trust offices.
With some show of conclusiveness Ser-
geant W. Darwin, formerly of Bendigo, now
of Carlton (Vic.), claims to have been the
first to enlist. Previous claimants to the
honor were: For military service, Bugler
William Henry Groves, aged 21, of Geelong,
sworn in August 12, ’l4; for naval service,
Engineer-midshipman H. A. Willian, Citi-
zens’ Naval Forces, Williamstown, sworn in
August 5. On August 4 the day war was
declared, Darwin offered his services, and,
leaving Bendigo by the early train next day,
passed the doctor at the Victoria Barracks,
Melbourne. On August 6 he received a
letter from Joe Cook, then Prime Minister,
congratulating him, and one from the
A.A.G., Defence Department, stating that he
was probably the first civilian in the Com-
monwealth to offer his services, although a
few of the permanent officers had done so as
soon as they heard that war had been
declared. Darwin left with the 7th (Vic.)
Battalion, and saw 2£ years’ service in Gal-
lipoli and France before being invalided
home.
Boyce Bowden, who has written some of
the best verse produced in these parts during
the last two or three years, has reached at
any rate half the height of his desires.
Before compulsion was talked of in M.L.
he twice tried for khaki and was turned
away ; now he has managed to get into the
clothes, though for the present he is only on
a staff job. But having got his nose inside
he has hopes of something more by and bye.
“Bad Australian,” from Argentina:—
In Australia when a train runs off the track
details of the occurrence are published broadcast,
and “Pro Bono Publico” and other experts write to
the papers to say that such a thing could not
occur if the railways were run by Private Enter-
prise. Now, in this country, where the railroads are,
with few exceptions, owned by P.E., a few derail-
ments do not amount to a row of pins. A month
age I was making a journey over one of the northern
roads, and part of the train derailed three times in
25 miles. Nobody appeared to worry, and all the
able-bodied passengers cheerfully lent a hand in
prizing the cars on to the track again. When the
last car was lifted on the pilgrims shook the frogs
out of their boots and climbed aboard the canteen
car, where drinks were ordered, and the convoy
moved on to the next derailing point. On that
road they have had as many as 280 derailments in
one month; but it should be explained that the
road was mostly afloat, there being “slacks” of Bin.
to 12in. in many parts. The hardened traveller in
this country doesn’t worry about derailments; but
our collisions leave nothing to be desired. P.
Enterprise merely declares a dividend and considers
the question of another increase of tariff.

“Seven Days’ Leave,” in which Allan
Wilkie appeared to a packed audience at
the Grand Opera House (Sydney) on Satur-
day, is quite a “possible” melodrama. The
soldiers look like soldiers and occasionally
act like soldiers; and in their less exciting
moments all the characters behave quite
normally. Of course, the German spy and
his accomplice, a lady who turns out to be
one of the Crown Prince’s mistresses, are
afflicted with incomparable stupidity at all
moments of crisis, and the hero can also be
depended upon to sacrifice his chances of
escape in order to make a speech of the
kind that a melo. audience expects for its
money. At the same time there is good
comedy in the subsidiary plot, and the
“Baby Mine," at
Sydney Criterion.

who lost his twins.
character drawing,
though crude, does
not offend by ex-
aggeration. The
scene of the un-
veiling of a sol-
die r s’ memorial
outside the village
church, with a
crowd, the vicar
and the choir
hymning, is ad-
mirably produced.
The audience gave
as great a welcome
to this scene as it
did to the sub-
marine “sensation”
upon which the
play has been
built. The audi-
ence is shown a
German under-
water craft at the
bottom of the sea,
and sees it rise.
Then a change of
scene shows the
surface of the sea, and, emerging, the
turret, which is fired upon by two British
destroyers and the craft sunk.
* * * *
Allan Wilkie is sufficiently his part,
though he barks more loudly than he did as
Hamlet. Arthur Styan gives an admirable
character study of a British colonel, his
“Carry On!” speech being splendidly deliv-
ered. Edward Landor and Henri Dore pro-
vide some genuine comedy as soldiers. Nellie
Ferguson is a good enough replica of a
German spy to incur any audience’s hatred.
Fredetc. Watts is a pleasant heroine, and
Elwyn Harvey a vivacious ingenue. But
the most important work is in the capable
hands of the stage-carpenter and the scenic-
artist.
** * *
“Baby Mine,” produced at the Criterion
(Sydney) on Saturday, is announced as an
overseas success in three convulsions; it is
an Australian failure in one yawn, one
double bed and three dolls. It begins in the
second act and ends when the supply of
dolls runs out. This Broadway winner,
picked by the Firm, looks like being an
also-ran in Australia. It is the flimsiest,
thinnest pretence of a play ever imported.
The plot is not worth discussing; there are
laughs in it, but no real characters except
the policeman (admirably played by Edwin
Lester) and an Italian woman, placed in
the capable hands of Marion Marcus Clarke.
The chief characters are played by three
dolls, and the audience is required to imagine
them as babies. These celluloid infants
are nursed, thrown about and juggled with
throughout two bedroom scenes. As a mov-
ing picture with real infants something could
be made out of this situation. Beatrice
Holloway is rapidly improving. She makes
a charming figure of light comedy, though
her work is still occasionally crude, and
she hardly has the personality that "gets
over.” Robert Greig is his hard-working,
jolly, plump self, and Fred Maguire
bustles through a busy part. The first
appearance in Australia of Violet Yorke
does not call for three cheers, nor for
a vote of censure upon the management.
She is merely pleasantly unreal in an awk-
ward part that could have been done better
by a home-made actress. The most charm-
ing thing in the farce is Beatrice Holloway’s
frequent graceful leap into bed. Life ‘in
many a home would be brightened if more
wives adopted the method.
Sydney James, “Billy” and six of the
Royal Strollers started a short season at the
Playhouse (Sydney) on Saturday night
The show is worth tramping to. The Chief
Stroller is given a hand by Madeline Rossi-
ter, Connie Milne, Josie Jackson, G. W
Desmond, George Graystone, Cyril North-
cote and a handy orchestra under Arthur
Frost. James’s humorous character sketch
“The Night Watchman,” is one of the
brightest things on the bill. But, take
notice, the unpleasant freak represented by
Northcote should be censored.
* * * *
That sound bellowdrama, “When London
Sleeps,” is having another airing at the Hip-
podrome, under the supervision of William
Anderson. On Saturday it was the change
of bill, and a packed house enjoyed it as if
it were a newcomer to Sydney. Anderson
set it well, and George Cross, Lorna Forbes,
Rutland Beckett, Florence Fanning and
Watson did the rest. Lorna Forbes,
by the way, demanded notice with the
Roberts-Day co. in “Pete” and “The Hypo-
crites,” in Maoriland. Ricketts and Rege
Robins did the scenery for the Hippodrome
production—much of it unusually good.
“Yo'i’re in Love” is nearing the end of its
summer cruise in the s.s. High Hope. When
that unsinkable ship pulls out from Her
Majesty’s, Sydney will be short of a bright
frivolity.

Ethel Vaugn, comedienne, is the new name
on Sydney Tivoli’s time-table. Ethel is
billed quietly and becomingly as “the Confi-
dential Secretary to the firm of Joy and
Mirth,” but she doesn’t betray too many of
her employers’ secrets. Little Ruth Budd
and the Camille Trio remain the big turns
of the bill, and Miss Lilyan and Martha
Boggs continue to go through their quaint
and graceful dances. Edna Foster and the
tall drummer who bawls like a chicken.
Mabelle Morgan, Joe Reed, Anita, the Shel-
dons and some others make night-time gay.

“Peg o’ My Heart,” after a successful
return visit to Adelaide King’s, is being
played by Sara Allgood and a strong co.
(which now includes Cyril Mackay and Kay
Souper) round the country towns of S.A.
At the Royal “Mr. Manhattan” is just
coming in. At the Tivoli Fitzherbert has
been showing the Face ; Roland Conway was
the galvanised corpse, and Lesley Adrienne
was as pleasant a heroine as Dora Mostyn
was an unpleasant hag. Hilarity at the
Majestic is provided mostly by Tom Hav-
erley and J. P. O’Neil, with some good old-
fashioned Irish-American fun. The thought-
reading McEwin turned up to give an
exhibition of his powers on the night of
Eight-Hours’ Day. Picture shows: West’s,
Wondergraph, Pav. and Grand, have all
taken a fancy to pose as moral reformers.
An Adelaide show :
The annual exhibition of the Camera Club pro-
duced the usual duel between P. H. Williams (sec-
retary) and A. Wilkinson (ex-president) for first
place. Wilkinson won with “A Girl in a Kitchen” ;
Williams second with some gumtrees at sunset.
Vic. and N.S.W. artists sent some of their best
work, but their studies were somewhat monotonous.
Sowden, president, told exhibitors in opening the
show that they were lacking in initiative. He
wants to see, among other thingjs, an historical
records section of the Camera Club. Sowden men-
tioned also that a Federal exhibition of photo-
graphic work is to start next month. Sydney will
see it first.

play seems to have shrunk with age. The
deceased father of “L’Aiglon” is no longer
the only man in modern history who
dreamed of conquering Europe and ruling
the world. When the consumptive son of
the great French warlord stands, spot-
lighted, on the historic battlefield of Wag-
ram and sees visions of dying soldiers and
hears echoes of their groanings drowned by
triumphant music, one feels that the grue-
some sights and noises are only feeble sug-
gestions of what may be conjured from the
battlefields of Belgium and France by some
future descendant of Germany’s Clown
Prince. It is here, too, that the play seems
weaker than in Tittell Brune’s time,"because
the ghostly effects are less efficient and the
actress' in the spotlight (Kathlene Mac-
donell) is unequal to the strain of the situa-
tion. She is insufficiently magnetic, or
“powerful,” in her personality, whilst her
phrasing is as bad as her enunciation. To
the bulk of the audience the plot of the
story is hardly made coherent, and its ex-
clusively French sentiment remains a mys-
tery, like the pronunciation of the charac-
ters’ names. Napoleon, junior, reared as
something of an interned alien at the Aus-
trian Court, and dragged into a puerile poli-
tical conspiracy just when he ought to be
bathing in cod-liver oil for his lungs’ sake,
is the hysterical creature of hysterical cir-
cumstances, and a perfectly clear statement
of his position and his infirm ideas is of
first importance. The actress fails in the
chief essential, but her appearance, deport-
ment, tone and, to a great extent, her man-
ner could hardly be better. She looks a
trifle too boyish, but that is better than
looking girlish.

Redgrave, as Flambeau the old French
grenadier, has the advantage of introducing
the only touches of comic relief. He gives
a broad performance of a very grateful
part. Atholwood is excellent in a mere
sketch of a character; Emma Temple is
sympathetic as the elderly Archduchess who
lures L’Aiglon away to his final mass, and
Eily Malyon is a well-cliosen representative
of the woman who disguises herself as the
young escapee when his poor little conspir-
acy is arranged. None of the other 30
assistants in this crowded fancy-dress enter-
tainment leave a strong impression on one’s
mind. Plumpton Wilson is a weak, un-
cheerful Emperor of Austria, and his inter-
view with his grandson goes for less than
its dramatic worth. Waldron is a cold,
colorless Prince Metternich most of the
time, looking impossibly young and beauti-
ful for a worn diplomatist of 56.

“Grandad Rudd” continues at Melbourne
King’s to hold the mirror up to human
nature. Thus doth it appal some of the
girls, who reckon that h.n. finishes a
bad third to millinery in the handicap of
life. “Steele Rudd’s” new drama is a
humorous display of types, and a droll
domestic story. It touches its limit of fun
when Gran’ incites his relatives to sing
the tunes the old cow died of in order to
make the milk' of her lineal descendants

Everything this paper has said about Mel-
bourne Tivoli in the last three weeks can be
taken as read for the present issue. The
same bill as before continues to hold its
own, and when a Tivoli programme remains
green for several weeks it is evidently deep-
rooted in public esteem.
The week’s curiosity at Hoyt’s, Mel-
bourne, is a Yankee pacifist who invents a
high expl°siv e and is reluctant to sell it to
nis Government when war is threatened.
-Lhis conundrum can be studied in “The
Greatest Tower,” and the celebrated Ethel

W irths’ Circus comes as naturally at Cup-
time in Melbourne as a blush to the cheek of
innocence. There’s never a slip between the
Cup and the Circus. This year the feats
m the arena and roars in the menagerie will
start on Friday (19th)—when “a colossal
assemblage of human stars will shine.”
Melbourne Repertory Co. will have
another innings at the Playhouse next
Saturday (20th). Galsworthy’s fantasy,
The Pigeon,” will fly for one night only,
and patrons of literary drama are advised
to get in early. The three acts of “The
Pigeon” being somewhat brief, a comedietta
by John Palmer will also come to pass.
“0.K.”: A French version of “Quinneys’”
is about to be produced at the Paris Gym-
nase, under the title of “La Petite Reine.”
The young daughter of the old art-dealer,
who pairs off with Dad’s rather unscrupu-
lous assistant in the business, is the Little
Queen. The French version features the
tactful daughter rather than the masterful
old man. Later a translation of “Sven-
gali” is to be tried at the same theatre, but
whether it will be presented in up-to-date
form, or be dressed in accordance with Du
Maurier’s illustrations of the novel, is not
stated. There is no dramatic reason why
tall Taffy should continue to wear the long
side-whiskers of a bygone English age, or
Trilby’s one song shouldn’t be something less
antique than “Ben Bolt,” which was one of
grandfather’s sentimental ditties even at the
date given by Du Maurier to his story.
“Trilby” admits of modernisation. Besides,
the long “Dundreary” whiskers that Taffy
flaunted were never fashionable outside of
the British Empire. They were the joke of
Europe and America, w r here the Dundreary
satire came from. In France and Italy they
have always marked the Englishman for ridi-
cule in farcical comedy, and until quite
lately the Italians were taught by their stage
that the typical Englishman was a ridiculous
ass who gloried in flowing side-whiskers.
From “Rosna” in London :
Lieut. Mills, a son of Maoriland’s U.S.S.
Co. magnate, who was recently posted missing,
has been reported a prisoner of war in Ger-
many. Another missing soldier, of whom, un-
fortunately, there is no news is young Fabian
Reeves, naval airman, son of Pember Reeves, who
was a stalwart with “Dick” Seddon in the old days.
His machine was seen to drop in the German lines.
Mrs. Hope Osborne is to marry Captain R. A.
Norton, R.N., who is attached to the British Lega-
tion at Monte Video. Also, Lillian Snow, of
Christchurch (M.L.), has an altar appointment with
Captain Ropner, a grandson of a British peer.
Lieut. Val. Stocker, M.C., son of Christchurch’s
(M.L.) archdeacon, and now Hun-smashing with the
Maorilanders, has married Dorothea Catherine Staley,
a Somerset maid. The deed was done at Chelsea.
Major H. J. R. Clayton, a Sydneysider, will re-
turn to you from the fray presently with a newly-
captured missus. She was a Miss Midwood, of
Oakley Hall, Market Drayton.

“B.”: Queerest trades? Well here’s a
start. At Coleraine (Vic.) a firm hangs out
the sign :
OLD SHIRTS RENOVATED.

“Norbell”: Talking about “Julius Caesar.”
George Rignold opened Her Majesty’s, Syd-
ney, in ’B7 and kept going for eight years,
seldom being out of the bill himself, and
the ghost walked every Monday without a
miss. On relinquishing, the lease he took a
benefit (his first, by the way), and elected
to do Marc Antony in the forum scene.
Scott Inglis was Brutus, and all the mum-
mers in Sydney came on as omnes to do
honor to the Big Chief. It was a great day.
Rignold was up in the pulpit and going
strong when he remembered that he’d left
Caesar’s will in the dressing-room. The old
general kept his head, and during one of
the noisy interruptions by the rabble he
managed to hiss: “For Gorsake fetch the
blanky will!” A noble Roman smuggled it
on and it was passed up to the old man just
in time.
“Up Stage”: Managers nowadays evi-
dently devote more thought to the actor’s
physical attributes in fulfilling a “type”
than they give to his intellect. Recently
met a well-known mummer and asked the
reason of his infrequent appearances. “With
20 years’ experience behind me,” he said,
have just discovered that I’m a
type,’ and unless there’s a drunken sailor
m the cast, they don’t want me.” Reminds
me of a story pros tell about Pinero. A
down and out actor, whose face was a study
in dissipated curves, accosted him one night,
and Pinero, knowfing his capability, engaged
him as a type. The actor took advantage
of the time before rehearsals commenced, to
spruce up. A presentable actor went for-
ward to claim the part, but Pinero couldn’t
place him, until the player gave particulars
or their meeting. “Good Lord!” exclaimed
the playwright, “where are your pimples?”
Ebenezer Ward, just dead in Perth, must
have been about the last surviving personal
friend of G. V. Brooke. He organised a big
benefit in Melbourne for Brooke, and it was
in his company that he first visited Adelaide,
which was to be his future home for half a
century. The star gave him a chance in a
small part in “Hamlet,” and it was one of
Ward’s own favorite stories how stage-fright
took hold of him and made him forget his
opening line, so that Hamlet had at last to
say it for him—damning him audibly mean-
while, after the manner of that period. Ward
played Hamlet himself later, as Adelaide’s
leading amateur; also Claude Melnotte and
other big parts.
“B.O.” : Unless steps are taken to prevent
an unheard-of departure from recent prece-
dent, Australia will shortly see comedy
played by a co. without a “star.” The Tait
firm is responsible for this, and a start will
be made in Sydney, in November, with H. A.
Vachell’s “Quinneys’.” Gregan McMahon
will produce the comedy and play a part.
Melbourne has seen “Quinneys’ *’ twice under
repertory auspices.
“S.”: I have just seen the limit. It
occurs in “Dawn,” a filming of a Haggard
novel. The heroine has a dog. No film
heroine is now considered complete without
a tyke of sorts. At one moment the har-
rowed damsel, believing her hound dead,
gives way to a copious flow of real tears.
Tears in the pic’s are always absolutely
genuine. You put a few drops of gß'cerine
in the eye, and leave the rest to nature.
From the glycerined orb of the harrowed
heroine dripped copious water, and her tripe
consumer, clasped in her arms, faithfully
sharing her woes, suddenly began to weep
too. They had glycerined the poor mongrel,
and down its manicured cheeks coursed a
long succession of pearly tears. 10 .to the
inch, and spattered visibly on the floor.
“Bilmyjar” : What is our Board of Film
Censors supposed to suppress? At a Syd-
ney suburban movie show last week I saw
a picture in wh' di a most disgusting fight
was portrayed. With the object of remov-
ing the villain from the plot a totally irrele-
vant character was introduced, and one of
the most brutal “scraps” I have ever watched
was screened. It lasted throughout hundreds
of feet of film. The fighters were represented
as having their faces gradually beaten to
pulp. I can hardly be accused of super-
sensitiveness, being a member of the A.I.F.
and accustomed to fairly rough scenes, but
the spectacle sickened me.
A line from Cissie Jamieson, who for
eight years was J. C. Williamson’s confi-
dential secretary and is now working in
New York for Hugh Ward: “I spent a de-
lightful Sunday with Tyrone Power and his
wife and two children. His first wife was
Edith Crane. He is looking splendid and
working hard on ‘pictures.’ He is to play
leading role here in Chu Chin Chow, Oscar
Asche’s new money-spinner. I also met
Elsie Wilson and her husband, Rupert
Julian, who are said to be the most success-
ful Australians in picture work from the
producing standpoint. Julian is a director
of the Universal Film Company. Enid
Bennett is also a star in pictures, and has
just cut a dash in ‘They’re Off!’ Nellie
Wilson, Ivy Scott and the three Castles girls
are all working here ; and I often see Muriel
Starr, who will probably soon return to
Australia.”
“Bluebeard”: “The New Sin,” done lately
at Sydney Playhouse, was produced in Mel-
bourne by Gregan McMahon’s Repertory
Theatre Co., at the Athenaeum, December,
1914. The cast consisted of Helton Daniel,
Gregan McMahon, C. Dougherty, Frank
Keon, Wardale Greenwood, Gerald Carr and
Clinton Newell. The last three are now on
active service.
Madge Titheradge, who has just had
a “couple of corns” removed from her
vocal chords, which meant a fortnight’s
profound silence, is to be principal boy in
the next Christmas panto, at Drury-lane.
That will be her second experiment in tha.t
line.
“Private Boxer”: Amongst this year’s
most successful plays in London are three
of a khaki tint all seen in Australia —“In-
side the Lines,” “Seven Days’ Leave,” and
“London Pride.” Of the trio the first was
so frigidly received in Sydney that it has
never been seen in Melbourne, and the last-
named was such a freeze in Melbourne that
it has never been staged in Sydney or any-
where else in the Commonwealth. “Seven
Days’ Leave” is the only one to hit the
popular taste here, though I doubt whether
that should be instanced as another case of
the survival of the fittest.
“Pic Mihi” : To my mind Will Whitburn
was the funniest “corner man” Australia
ever saw. Once a guy came to ask him to
train a new trotter, a full brother of the
speedy Emulator. Will said, “What can he
do?” “Oh,” replied the sport, “he’s a full
brother of Emulator.” “Umph,” says Billy,
“did you ever hear Melba sing?” “Yass,”
replied the punter. “Well,” said Whitburn,
“Charlie Mitchell’s her full brother and he
can’t even whistle.” Somebody challenged
him once for speaking of “Cupid and
Physicky.” “All right,” said my noble,
“call it Physique if you like.”
H. B. Irving’s latest experiment at the
Savoy, London, “Humpty Dumpty,” was an
unmitigated frost. It was written by the
usually successful H. A. Vachell, as the story
of a barber who was supposed to have suc-
ceeded to a peerage, but who, finding him-
self a mistaken identity, gladly returns to
his lathering-shop. H.B. was completely out
of his element as the face-mower tackling
the job of an earl, and he shut down after
10 performances and went away for a holi-
day.
“C. Ockney”: “High Jinks” has at last
come to an end at London Adelphi, after a
very respectable war-time run of just on 12
months. It is succeeded by the long-
expected musical version of Pinero’s “Magis-
trate,” which is being “produced” by Aus-
tralia’s respected theatrical friend Robert
Courtneidge. The lively farce is expected
to mark a new departure in the song-and-
dance world. To begin with, it has a plot.
“E.T.”: Pinero’s early success, “The
Magistrate”—seen in Australia in the
Brough-Boucicault days—has scored again
in London (at the Adelphi) in musical-com-
edy guise. The farce has been re-christened
“The Boy.” Australia’s old friend, Robert
Courtneidge, is producer, and the long-
familiar names of Lionel Monckton and
Howard Talbot appear on the bill.
Haddon Chambers is, after a long spell,
preparing to take the stage in London again.
His newest bantling is “The Saving Grace.”
Charles Hawtrey is to have the “fat.”
From London:—
Captain Bruce Bairnsfather, humorist, has built up a
rambling ramshackle sort of play which he calls “A
Fragment from France in Two Explosions, Seven Splin-
ters and a Gas Attack.” This show was voted a bit too
long and involved on the opening night, but since
then it has been judiciously condensed. Goodie Beeve,
described as a daughter of the Ada who has been
captivating Australian audiences, scored a hit with
a pleasant Irish song. The Daily Telegraph hails
her as “a promising newcomer.”

woman charged with stealing—that she was

“No, it isn’t. My second wife was a widow when she married me.”
“in a certain condition,” and therefore not
responsible. Judge Gordon adjourned the
sitting for an examination of the accused
by two doctors. Both disagreed as to the
chance of a pregnant woman suddenly doing
abnormal acts. The Judge then declined to
accept her plea as an excuse for theft, and
sentenced her to 18 months’ imprisonment,
which is likely to be much interrupted.
There is a proper prejudice against letting

stupid conditions of a gaol.

“0.K.” writes: —■
Stories of David Hennessy’s devices for securing
his sixth consecutive election to Melbourne’s Gaud
Mayoralty were double-edged satires @n civic rule.
The little things done by David cut into the
character of that glorified baker on the one hand, and
were painful admissions of municipal magnate char-
acter on the other. Incidentally the voting dis-
closures reveal that secrecy of the ballot doesn t go
for much in a municipal brotherhood election for
chief magistrate. One councillor pleaded that he
couldn’t afford to go against a man who could put
business in his way. Another candidly admitted that
his own poor opinion of David didn’t affect the fact
that his wife had made him promise to vote for the
husband of her friend. Another whimpered that
David had once wheedled him into promising his
support in perpetuity, and though he had recently
beggied, with tears in his eyes, to be given a release
from his obligation, David persisted in holding him
to his promise. Where does the secrecy of a City
Council ballot come in if councillors can talk like
this? And what sort of custodians of public in-
terests are men who can be so easily nobbled and
bounced into sanctioning a scheme of log-rolling?
Nearly 50 per cent, of Melbourne’s City Fathers
stand convicted of either spineless subservience to
undue influence or active sympathy with the princi-
ples of Tammany. Anyhow, Hennessy was walloped.

“C.”: A quaint custom, originated
by a student who may now be under arms in
Flanders or the sod on a French hillside, is
observed nightly at Trinity College, Melb.
University. At 10 o’clock a dormitory
window is thrown up, and the resonant salu-
tation goes forth: “Good night, sir.”
Promptly comes the eerie response, “Good
night, sir.” The reply is that of a body
void. “The Man in the Church,” they call
him. When Trinity’s new chapel was
being built, it was found that the north side
echoed any sound from the direction of the
dormitory. The discovery led to the nightly
exchange of valedictions, which is now a
tradition of the place.

Billjim’s yarn of the circus:—
You think birds can fly, don’t you? Well, did
you ever see a bird capsize in midair and come
tumbling down out of the sky, end over end, side-
ways, any way, every way, tail first, upside down for
thousands of feet, and then suddenly right itself and
go skimming away at a rate of about 200 miles an
hour owing to the momentum it had gained? The
first time I saw it done was by an enemy biplane in
difficulties over Bapaume. The jockey was riding
at probably 10,000 ft., when our batteries opened
on him. All of a sudden the nose of his
machine went up, he staggered and wavered, and
then came slipping down, tail first. He must have
faUen like a stone several thousands of feet, appar-
ently utterly out of control. A great cheer went
up from the troops watching, a tribute to the
gunners. These might have pasted the gyrating
machine all the way down, but they didn’t. The
Hun momentarily disappeared in a cloud. We won-
dered where he would hit the ground. The drifting
summer mist was possibly only 5000 ft. above the
earth; but the ’plane came flashing out of
it right side up and fleeing for its own
lines at the rate of 150 miles an hour, with the
pilot waving cheerily to his enemies below. A great
howl of laughter and chagrin went up, a howl to be
quickly followed by a hearty cheer for the bluffer.
Before our gunners could alter their range and reset
their fuses Fritz was back home.

“Pixie”: The correct English miss who
had nearly captured a real bush Billjim for
ever, lost him the day the dog-cart became
stuck in the English mud and the spirited
horse tried to kick the turn-out to pieces.
While the savage Australian was managing
the frightened brute the English rosebud
sat bolt upright, bravely stifling her screams
and hysterics. But just as the “gee” showed
signs'of giving in, and Billjim’s strong,
white teeth had penetrated his bottom lip,
her silvery humorless voice sounded: “Dear,
shall we come back this way?”
THE COMPLETE WARRIOR.
“And have you really and truly killed a lot of Germans?”
“Cert! Why, when we want over the top I always carried a scythe-stone to touch up
me bayonet when it got blunt.”
“Vic.’s” rabbit-skin racks: —
Stapley’s election as Gaud Mayor of Melbourne was
the most exciting since 1899. Duke of York (King
George) was expected in 1900, and a stiff tussle
came off between MeEacharn, who was then the
rabbito, and Gillott. MeEacharn won by one vote —
and then George did not come till 1901, when Gillott
was mayor. John Thomas Smith was seven times
mayor. He built the Queen’s Theatre, 1845, and
kept the pub next door, but that didn’t prevent him
being a leading member of the Church of England.
He went to London, expecting the first Victorian
knighthood, but did not get it, though he inter-
viewed Queen Victoria, who is imagined to have said
“What a vulgar man!’’ He became M.L.A. and
Minister for Mines and a good magistrate. Gatehouse
was the most eccentric mayor, and the yarn about
him riding home to South Yarra,. at one in the
morning, on a saveloy machine is still enjoyed.
“Halli”: What price the new orders by
the War Office, as announced by London
Weekly Despatch :
Trousers may be worn when officers are off duty
or when employed in an office.
Still, a man can always manage with a
helmet.
“White Collar”: No, I didn’t go to the
war; but all the same I would like to hear
myself described as “a typical Australian.”
I’m doing my best to provide gold and silver
bullets for our brave boys by going to patri-
otic dances, buying buttons from all the
nicest-looking girls and going in for raffles.
I do all this as a matter of duty, and the
only return I look for is to be described as
“a typical Australian” —especially after the
news of a great Australian victory has come
through. I always want to be very typical
then. Between ourselves I think I am as
typical as the next person; but I haven’t
got one of those hatchet faces that Phillip
(Tibbs writes about. Is it absolutely neces-
sary to have a hatchet face and be at the
war to be a typical Australian? I haven’t
got a hatchet face and I can’t go to the
war, because, you see, I am the sole support
of myself. I would do almost anything to
be thought typical—whatever it means.
Can’t one be a typical Australian by buying
buttons?

“Copra Bug”: Never before has one of
Burns-Philp’s steamers received such a wel-
come as did the Mindini on her arrival in
Tulagi (Solomon Isles) a few weeks ago;
and certainly no vessel ever arrived in the
knowledge of the oldest inhabitant with a
more assorted crew. Wealthy landowners,
racehorse-owners, a dentist, boundary-riders,
shearers (some of whom had never seen the
sea before) were all aboard, stoking, stew-
arding, painting, scraping or any old thing
that came along. The mate, who is a man
of few words and many actions, had his
work cut out piloting them round and show-
ing them what to do and what not to do;
and in return they taught him a few
wrinkles in the way of nautical terms which
will no doubt be of service to him in future.
F’rinstance, one morning he overhead two of
them talking in the starboard alleyway.
Said one to the other, “Hey, Bill, whose
turn is it to scrub this lane out!”

“Cherokee”: —•
Not all the devils are behind the German lines.
One, thank God, is in Melbourne Gaol. His name
is George Stephenson, a blacksmith’s striker, and the
stepfather of George Aisne Wood, not yet three,
whose dad was killed in action in Flanders. Ste-
phenson and his wife, w r ho rented a room in Rich-
mond, went to a picture-show the other night, and,
later, moans were heard coming from their room.
The police w r ere called, and they found the child
trussed and gagged and on the point of collapse.
When a John Ilop untied him he said: “Daddy tied
me up. You won’t tie George up, will you?” It
was an ingenious process of torture which earned
Stephenson the maximum of 12 months' hard, the
Bench’s bad opinion and a warning to his wife ("the
child’s mother). A chair was lashed to an iron cot,
and the child strapped to it. His arms were extended
and tied by the wrists to the ironwork of the cot.
The thighs and legs were uncovered and were very
cold. The head and face w T ere enveloped in a pair
of trousers, the top portion of which was tied to the
ironwork of the cot above the child's head. There
was a little slit in the trousers which allowed por-
tion of his nose through. Then a towel was tied
over the mouth and on to the ironwork of the cot
and the job was complete.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Port Kembla sank with her whistle blowing.”
Of old we heard hoarse callings
By waterside and bay,
As, lifting slow and falling, "
The big boats moved away—
At lonely ocean meetings—
Just two long trails of smoke —
In deep-lunged, booming greetings
The white-plumed whistles spoke.
The voices of the steamers
Are quiet in these days
Of radiant, wireless streamers
And winking Morse-lamp’s rays,
That span the night’s grey distance
And leap o’er leagues of sea....
Deep-smothered in dark pistons
The steamers’ voices be.
But when the wireless falters,
And when the bright lamps fail,
The steam we lead in halters
Is freed again to hail.
Oh, ships on the horizon,
Oh, ports with lamps of home,
Hear you the call that dies on
The slow, sea winds that come?
With spray o’er steep decks flying,
Salt spray that lashed and clung
Deep-sunken, broken, dying,
The wounded ship gave tongue.
But even man who made her,
To triumph o’er the sea—
Not even man could aid her
In her extremity.

NOT THE FIRST
COMPLAINT.
CLAUDE: “That little wisp of your hair keeps
tickling my nose.”
ANITA: “Yes, it's always getting in the
way.”
“T.X.T.” heaves a line: —
The discovery of a mine off the coast near Gabo
Island should settle the fierce discussion that has
raged as to whether the big s.s. Cumberland was
sunk from the inside or the outside. The accumu-
lation of evidence laboriously pieced together seemed
to make it certain that the ship struck something and
the fact that a mine has been found in almost the
same spot, added to what is already known, ought to
settle the argument, and as insurances from £500,000
to £850,000 depend on whether the Cumberland
was wrecked by enemy action or not, the settlement
of the question is more than academic. As to
how mines got thereabouts, the naval authorities
have had hints enough. Owing to the currents
which meet at Cape Howe and its vicinity, it isn’t
easy to say where they were dropped, but it is
common talk among shipping men as to who dropped
them.
From The Bulletin’s secret service:—
In August, 1917, a number of Prussian military
and naval notables were seated in conference in
Berlin. The talk had turned, as usual at these
gatherings of late, upon the subject of “Who really
started this war ?” Several opinions had been
expressed, when Wilhelm, hitherto morosely silent,
asserted himself in rather an exasperated tone: “No,
you’re all wrong, and you’ll perhaps be surprised
to learn that the man who is responsible for this
war is Teddy Roosevelt.” Subdued murmurs of
incredulity greeted this amazing statement, and the
Kaiser proceeded: “Some years ago Roosevelt was
present at our annual manoeuvres. After the show
was over he came up to me wildly enthusiastic, and
slapping me on the back exclaimed: ‘Bill, old boy,
you have here an army that could lick the world.’
But, concluded the Emperor in a sadder tone, “the
was wrong.”
* * * *
Upon the heels of the cable describing the
latest thing in war surgery comes a letter
from the patient, Private F. G. Moon, of the
21st (Victorian) Battalion, explaining how
he was roofed by part of his ribs. He was
wounded by shrapnel, and the X-rays showed
splintered bone and pieces of metal on his
brain. He was trepanned and the debris
removed. Then the patient was sent to Eng-
land and to the care of Arthur Pearce Gould.
That eminent knight took out a piece of the
wounded man’s rib, opened his scalp and filled
a gap in the skull with the transferred carti-
lage. The join has grown together, “making
a natural job of it,” as Moon puts it. “I
am first-class,” he writes. “Eight days after
I had had the stitches taken out of my head
and my side I was up and walking about.”

“Peri Winkle”: The conscientious man
gets a rough passage through this world. At
Moama (N.S.W.) the School of Arts has a
rule against smoking, and the captain of
the fire brigade was detailed to see that
it was observed on the occasion of a political
meeting at which the main item was J. C. L.
Fitzpatrick, Assistant-Treasurer. After the
rally Fitzpatrick was having a quiet whiff
on the premises when the fireman asked him
to put his pipe put. The next act was a
letter of complaint against the fireman from
an officious outsider. The Bumbles, instead
of complimenting the former for doing his
duty “without fear or favor,” got down and
carried a resolution that an apology be
tendered Fitz and that the fire-fighter be
instructed to be more careful in future.
“More careless” is what the poor fellows
probably meant.

“Gron”: Melbourne Herald is trying to
Win-the-War by sooling the Pride of the
Nursery on to the local slacker. The other
evening it published a photograph of little
Willie in full uniform, yelling, “I have
been rejected for active service on account
of my youth. Oh! who will take
my place?” It appears that this nine-
year-old has been helping to lead riderless
horses about, and has been made a life gover-
nor of the Society for the Prevention of
Lost Trouser But-
tons, or something
of the kind. It
makes Billjim feel
ill to come back
and find this sort
of slush in vogue.
Another recruiting
idea that gets me
down is the brass
band which blows
Yank-time nearly
all day from the
steps of the Town
Hall. Any man
who has stood by
for the last tv'o
years and more,
and watched im-
perturbed his cob-
bers trotting off to
do their bit isn’t
going to be stam-
peded into the
trenches by the
most brilliant ren-
dition of “Ten-
nessee” or the
“Dooley’s Foxtrot.”
In the meantime. 25 or 30 hefty bandsmen
are drawing five or six bob a day for enter-
taining the street loiterers.

“Cape 1 Ielles”: The Oakleigh (Vic.)
branch of the National Federation is of the
opinion that where senior cadets attend
evening classes at technical and like schools,
they should be credited with one hour’s mili-
tary training for every two hours’ attend-
ance at such classes, providing that this does
not exempt them for more than half
their training. Some lads in my dis-
trict attend four nights weekly at a
technical school after a hard day’s work,
and then are obliged to fall in nearly every
Saturday afternoon to make up for night
parades missed. It is too much to ask.
When the employer is forced to allow Young
Australia time off for military duty and to
pay him for that time, then will we obliter-
ate the unfairness of drilling the working
boy in what is his only play-time.
“0.C.”: Pathetic ad. cut from London
Morning Post :
A Soldier’s lonely wife offers a kind good Home to
a Pekingese Puppy.—Mrs. 8., care of H. S. King and
Co., 9 Pall Mall.
It never occurred to her to advertise for a
hungry English baby.
Gunner A. T. Jones records his part in
the first day of a “push” :
Reveille, 12.30 a.m.—a grisly hour. Fed up and
breakfasted. We left the waggon line with gun-
limbers and pack-liorses. Each artilleryman with
ammunition was riding one horse carrying four, and
DOUBLE-BARRELLED.

up ?”
BROTHER FRED : “Everything's up! The
bloomin’ Government's bringing in the
Bachelor Tax, and the girls won’t have
a fellow if he doesn’t enlist.”
leading another horse carrying eight rounds i» packs.
We waited in rear of the gun position till daybreak.
A large number of walking cases, wounded in the
arms, heads and legs staggered past us. They
seemed fairly cheerful and passed the good news that
we were well ahead. All our guns around were
firing heavily, but, as yet, no returns came near us.
The Huns’ last barrage line could be seen well ahead.
We went forward 3000yds. and took up our position
in the open in ground badly pitted and ploughed
with shell-holes. On the right and left as we came
along shells of all kinds were bursting. Tanks,
crawling very slowly, passed us on each flank as they
made for Fritz's lines. We were held up for awhile
because some of the guns were stuck in shell-holes,
and then Fritz got on to us at last. A mate, un-
conscious, passed on a stretcher, and I saw that he
was badly hit. The wounded kept pouring by us.
Among them was a Tommy with four inches of the
bone of what had been his arm sticking forward in
front of his body, his right leg blown off, and head
wounds. Dead men and horses were lying on
the side of the track. The man who
guided us was an expert at his work, as com-
paratively few shells fell directly on our
road. As soon as one did fall, the hole was
immediately filled up by the Engineers. For five
miles along the track one could see every foot, a
spot or clot of blood from the wounded men who
had traversed it. Many of the wounded horses,
especially the old Australians, were very game, and
carried on at their work after they were badly hit.
Give our regards to the Australian nag. He’s a good
nag.

“Dinkum”: We got back one night from
digging trenches —crook. Sleep was our
greatest necessity. The boys had just
settled down into the dreamy state when a
sergeant poked his head in and said insinu-
atingly : “Any o’ youse blokes want jobs on
them strategic railways?” ‘ The cove next
me turned in his slumber. “Put me down
for a sleeper.”

“Gamil Askarri” : At the second attack on
Samson Itidge, Gaza, Holy Land, when the
Ist Camel Corps were advancing in open
order on foot, one of the largest-sized “Coal
Buckets” in use by Jacko burst right
amongst them, one Billjiin being blown fully
10ft. in the air. The stretcher-bearers rushed
over, expecting a bad case, but to the amaze-
ment of all hands, the casualty picked him-
self up, dusted his clothes and carried on as
before. On being asked how he felt, he re-
plied O’.K. He added as an afterthought
that while he was going he got a grand view
of the scrap.
“Harrison O.”: Somebody got up at the
Melbourne Anglican Diocesan Synod the
other day to protest against the commercial
uses to which Church properties are put.
Many persons outside the fold have for long
regarded this as a scandal.
The Anglican Church owns
valuable properties in various
parts of Melbourne —ranging
from offices in the city and
warehouses in Flinders-lane
to slum dwellings in Ilich-
mond, most of the land having
been obtained in the form of
Crown grants, and, no matter
whether it is used for holy or
other purposes, the Church
does not pay rates or taxes
on it. In front of one church
a large drapery store has been
built; at St. Kilda recently a
bank has been erected on
church land at a v-shaped
corner and the tabernacle
relegated to the „ background ;
in another suburb holy ground
has been leased to a second-
hand clothes dealer, and so
on. The rental value of all
these properties must be enor-
mous, and there seems no
special reason why the Church
should be given a big advan-
tage over other landlords by
being relieved of rates and
taxes. Of recent years the
Anglican Church has become
a huge business concern. One
speaker at the Synod ob-
served : “Church officers often
devote their time to financial
instead of spiritual work, and
a provision ought to be made
in future that an Archbishop
of Melbourne should not be
able to add two and two to-
gether”—a remark calculated to make the
heathen buck up and be interested.
A dirty left has been swung at the muni-
cipal representatives on the Yic. Board of
Health by the Housing Commission. The
Board, under the Act of 1889, consists of
nine members, two nominated by the Gov-
ernment and the others by municipal bodies.
Concerning this system, the Commission
bluntly declares that its continuance “plainly
involves the fostering and perpetuation of
low sanitary ideals and administration
amongst the local governing bodies gener-
ally.” The system, of course, practically
appoints Bumble inspector of his own nuis-
ances ; and Bumble has shown, with painful
persistence, that he has no deeply-rooted
objections to the rubbish-tip under his break-
fast-room casement. The Commission recom-
mends —but no matter. Who in Parliament
cares what tne Commission recommends, and
why should any alderman lose sleep worry-
ing about the smell at the window?
From an Australian abroad:—
What’s the matter with Bendigo? Among the
charitable grants voted at the last meeting of the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge was one
of £4O “towards the theological training of a student
at Bendigo, Australia.” This Society is a Church of
ANOTHER SHORTCOMING.
M AY: “How atrociously short your dress is!"
JUNE: “Blame the tear. Everything's gone
up.”
England organisation, and has the Archbishop of
Canterbury as its president. It runs one of the
biggest bookshops in London, does a lot of publish-
ing, and spends its large annual revenue in a variety
of other directions as well. Are the Bendigo Church
of England folks really so stony-broke, or so care-
less of their reputation as to accept this paltry £4O
dole from an English society?
THE PEW-RENTER’S PRAYER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Speaking to the motion at the annual Synod of
the Anglican diocese of Melbourne, Mr. D. Martin
said that “he feared that if pew-rents were abolished
he might be obliged to sit beside someone who did
not please him.”
I am a lowly sinner who
Pays ev'ry Sunday for a pew
In church, and there I always pray
A better man to be each day.
I’ve prayed for years within the pen
I’ve leased ; apart from other men,
For though they’re all my brothers, I
Prefer them not to be close by
When on my knees I supplicate.
(I don’t so much mind when the plate
Hovers beneath my fleshy fist—
My contributions head the list!)
We all are equals—that I know ;
But some of us like here below,
While we can full-priced seats afford,
To comfortably praise the Lord 1
Abolish pew-rents ! Oh, ’twould be
Fatal! I hazard prophecy—
If such a thing should come to pass
The Church will lose its Upper Class !
I am a lowly sinner who
Pays ev’ry Sunday for a pew,
And this my heart-felt prayer and deep:
“Oh, do not make religion cheap t”

Albert of Belgium has fastened the
Order of the Crown upon Lieut-Colonel
I). T. Moore, commanding an Australian
battalion in France. The young warrior
already holds the D.S.O. and has been “men-
tioned” five times. He is only 25, and was
one .of the first on Gallipoli, where he
received a nasty knock at Lone Pine ridge.
Last year, from Pozieres, he was again put
aside for urgent repairs.
Moved along the last trail the Rev. Pat-
rick Dowling, one of the best-known Irish
padres in Sydney—a Kilkenny man and a
pupil of Cardinal Moran. After leaving
Goulburn College he was established in a
professorship at Manly (Sydney) College,
thence to the more open life of the General
Mission. His panegyric on Larkin, M.L.A.,
was so fine that Holman sent it forth in
pamphlet form to influence recruiting in
N. S. Wales. Dowling was one of the best
who ever helped a lame dog. Two distin-
guished Capuchins are his brothers. He
was well under 50 when the camel called.
HECTOR LAMOND, M.H.R.
( Illawarra, N.S.W.).
T)r. Bones’ Leeper, acting on doctor’s
orders, will shortly resign the wardenship
of Trinity College, Melb. University, which
he has held for 42 years. On his arrival
from Dublin and Oxford to take the post
he was young and very delicate, and he de-
voted his life to the success of the college.
Despite a tendency to wave the flag of
Derry, Leeper was very proud that
J rinity has sent 300 men and women to
the nation’s help. Two of his sons are offi-
cial translators for the Foreign Office. Inci-
dentally Trinity has turned out five Rhodes
scholars and six Australian bishops.
South Aus. claims to hold a world’s record
in the recruiting line. John Lewry, of the
Government Printing Office, lately enlisted,
and assured an astonished c.o. that he was
the last of nine brothers to do so. The other
eight signed on in England.
From his next friend :
The latest Cockney mention of George H. Reid is
a sketchy intimation that the man of disproportions
has taken to horse-riding as a means of reducing his
prevailing ungainliness. George tried the same thing
in Melbourne. A friend meeting G.H.R. out
on the perspiring neddy asked the why ness.
“To reduce flesh,” Reid replied. “Horseflesh?” said
the friend. George encountered so many jokes re-
garding his equestrian possibilities that he ceased
riding after a fortnight’s trial. (George never liked
a joke against Reid.) The one that broke him up
was made by a Melbourne editor. Meeting George
on his oppressed beast one day the journalist said:
“Good day! Out for a walk?” So little of the
horse was visible under his overlapping rider that the
query might have been quite ingenuous.
HIS DEFENCE.
SHE: “If you had no idea when we could
get married, why did you propose to
me ?”
HE: “To tell you the truth, dear, I hud no
idea you 'would accept me.”
Another of the Lone Pine D.S.O.’s,
Brigadier-General (then Captain) A. H.
Scott, of N. S. Wales, has gone west —killed
in the racket in France. He joined the 4th
Battalion as a lieutenant, and, at 26, was
commanding the 54th when the end came.
He was the second son of D. H. Scott, of
the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney, and
nephew of Justice Street. Born at Tumut
(N.S.W.), and educated at Sydney Gram-
mar. At Lone Pine, on the night of August
6, 1915, he held an exposed position until
the surrounding wounded were removed. He
and his men were then driven out by a rain
of bombs, but he rallied them and recaptured
the post.
“Sealing Wax”: Hanna, of N. S. Wales
Public Service Board, has taken his long-
threatened step of retiring, and W. D.
Loveridge, the Board’s “special constable,”
has been appointed deputy, while Hanna is
on long leave. It is thought by a section
of the service that the upshot of the inquiry
by commission now muddling along will be
the dropping of two members of the Board
and that one will carry on alone —Loveridge,
whose advance of late has been rapid.
“Bob” Semple, the Socialistic fire-eater who
came out of a Maoriland gaol the other day
where he had been put to cool off, gets it
right sometimes. “Gaol!” he exclaimed at
a welcome home; “gaol! where I was caged
nke a wild beast, dressed like a clown and
fed like a pig!” Robert says that this scheme
ot education hasn’t changed his views at all,
even with the visiting chaplain thrown
mu* the han S man available at all hours.
There s no accommodating some people.
George Skelton Yuill, who died in Sydney
lately, aged 69, was born in Scotland, where
his father, the Rev. James Yuill, was one
of the ministers who left the Established
Church on the formation of the Free Kirk
after the disruption of 1842. His mother
was formerly a Miss Anderson, who belonged
to the old-time shipping family. Anderson
and Skelton. After a spell in China, with
the shipping firm of Butterfield and Swire,
Yuill came to Sydney in 1880 and later
became general manager of the Orient Line
Horseracing in Australia and in China was
one of his hobbies. He owned Gallipoli.
Gadabout, Malkin, Harvestress, Rushford
and Clydesdale. His only daughter married
the Earl of Portarlington in 1907.
Bruce Warden, who died of wounds in
France the other day, came of a N. S. Wales
South Coast family, the oldest inhabitants
of Ulladulla. once known as Warden’s Head.
Young Warden, who was in Dalgety and
Co.’s Sydney office, enlisted at once when
war broke out, and left as a trooper in the
Ist Light Horse, with whom he put in two
dusty years in Egypt, Gallipoli and Sinai.
Invalided to England last year, he trans-
ferred to the infantry and won a commission
in France. An elder brother, also an infan-
try lieutenant, was lately wounded and is
now in an English hospital.
Killed in France, Lieut. Wilfred Beaver,
known to Bulletin readers as “Wilbea.”
For 10 years he was in the Commonwealth
service at Papua, and as R.M. of the West-
ern Division collected much native lore.
He enlisted 18 months ago, and had returned
to the Front recently after having been
wounded.
“C.S.”: Major Beavis, for whom the claim
is made that he is the youngest officer in
the forces with the rank, is one of a
Bathurst (N.S.W.) fighting family. He was
trained at Duntroon and went abroad with
a commission. The eldest of the three sons,
Captain Horace Beavis, has landed home on
furlough. The other boy hurled his last
grenade many months ago. The dad was
for a couple of years mayor of the western
town and died recently, an indirect victim
of Hunism.
A D.S.O. in his first action, a captain’s
stars, and a headstone in France summarises
the record of Harold B. Wanliss, a Ballarat
boy. Killed in action aged 25. The young
man, whose uncles are Colonel D. S.
Wanliss, C.M.G., 'a Gallipoli warrior, and
Irvine, M.H.R., joined the 29th (Yic.) Bat-
talion as second lieutenant in 1915, and was
transferred as lieutenant to the 14th (Jacka’s
crowd) nearly a year later. With this sec-
tion he got a “mention” for helping in a
raid commanded by Captain Cox, who had
under him Lieut. A. T. Harvey, 2nd Lieut.
R. D. Julian (killed), and 2nd Lieut. J. B.
Roderick. Wanliss was with a band of 83
picked athletes who had undergone a month’s
training for the event. They put an end to
51 Huns, their own casualties being 10
killed and 23 wounded.
T. H. Goodwin, who passed out lately at
Kew (Yic.), came to Australia in 1852
as an Anglican missionary to Binghi,
then fairly frequent in Victoria. After 14
years with black brother, Goodwin in-
voked collection-plates in various Victorian
country towns, and then settled down as
chaplain at Melb. general cemetery. He
resigned that job 25 years ago through fail-
ins' health : but the failure was very gradual,
for he lived to 92. For the past 13 years
lie had spent most of his time translating
books into Braille type for blind readers. He
had completed 120 volumes when the clock
stopped.
Brigade-Sergeant-Major T. J. Howard Ivy,
who was color-sergeant in the 18th Royal
Irish Regiment, died at Kew (Vic.) last
week, aged 87. He introduced himself to Vic-
toria in ’5B, and later was connected with the
Victorian Railways. The only bar on the
Crimean ribbon won by the 18th was for
Sebastopol. The regiment served in the
Maoriland War and was the last of the
Imperial regiments to leave Sydney for
England.
W. T. McCOY, Director of Education,
Tasmania.
The country breeds them hardy. Ivan
Howat, whose dad manages a beer-pump in
the Vic. Western District, had his leg blown
off lately. A pal has sent along to his rela-
tives a photograph of Ivan among a nest of
pillows head up and grinning, taken six
days afterwards.
“N.”: Bush Brother Martin Andrew* „ ,

Killed in action with the A.I.F. in France,
Private Iv. K. Saxby, aged 21. He was an
old boy of Sydney High School, and won
the P. N. Russell engineering scholarship
at Sydney Uni. a couple of years ago. He
enlisted in time to be in the closing act of
the Gallipoli tragedy, and was afterwards
sent to France, where he was wounded last
year at Bapaume. An elder brother, still
fighting, holds the D.C.M., and another, who
enlisted as a medical student, now has his
degree and is waiting to be sent to the
Front.
Signaller Tom Skeyhill, wounded at
Helles and totally blind, has now published
nine editions (45,000 copies) of his “Soldier
Songs from Anzac.” Most of his leisure
is spent in collecting for the Red Cross and
the Y.M.C.A., and his tally for 12 months
is over £ll,OOO. At Wangaratta (Vic.) he
got £3OO for the Red Cross, and at Inverell
(N.S.W.) £lO5O in response to an appeal
between two races at the local meeting. This
was for wounded soldiers. Other towns
yielded from £l5O to £550. At Murwillum-
bah he got £llO for a box of chocolates, and
he has sold “the same old tin of jam” over
and over again, until it has netted £4OOO. In
V .A. he raised £2OOO for the Red Triangle
and £2QOO for France’s Day.
Killed in France, Major Arnold Hoskings,
D. 5.0., who before the war was an elec-
trician at Port Kembla (N.S.W.). Rabaul,
Gallipoli and France have seen his foot-
prints ; his grave is on the Western Front.
He went with the Australian cadets to King
George’s Coronation.
Driver P. J. Garbudd, one of the seven
who took the first gun into action in Gal-
lipoli on April 25, 1915, is just back home
in Port Melbourne. Holding a S’African
war medal, he enlisted in Melbourne on
August 17, 1914. “At the Landing,” he
says, “I went over the side of the transport
under General Johnston, who was then
colonel of the 2nd Artillery Brigade. Our
hottest time was on May 8, when we started
with a gun from Gaba Tepe beach. Ten of
our 12 horses were killed. Next morning we
took two of the Maori howitzers into action.
We had to change position, and in taking a
turn sharply three leading horses went over
a precipice. I was in the saddle of the
fourth horse !”
“441” speaks out of Egypt:—
Jack Burgess, the drover whom the Never Never
knows so well, is over here doing his bit. He is
62, as smart on his feet as a youngster, and tells
you with pride that he never smoked or drank.
Many years ago he lived at Wilcannia on the
Darling. When the river happened to be running a
banker, any mobs of cattle coming through were
piloted across by Jack on his favorite pony Tom Tit,
than which nothing better on four legs ever lived
in water. Jack rode down to the Bitter Lakes here
one morning recently and speculated in 10 piastres’
worth of fish from a nigger, the Egyptian sitting
in his boat alongside a small jetty. The Australian

MY DUSTBOX OF DREAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(To be sung slowly, if the reader has the time.)
When I was much younger, I moped and I sighed
When a dream I had cherished exploded and died ;
So I rarely piped up when a chorus was sung,
For the habit of dreaming is strong with the young.
Chorus (It’s quite easy) :
With a tooral-li-ooral, li-ooral, li-ay f
I cherished the ruins and fragments of dreams,
And tried to recast them. How foolish it seems!
Hut it’s good to recall when no longer a kid
The wonderful, fat-headed things we once did.
Chorus (it’s easier now):
With a tooral-li-ooral, li-ooral, li-ay 1
But now I am old and my hair’s going grey,
I’ve learnt how to fool in a different way ;
So I’ve got a big dustbox with such a nice lid,
And there, ere they shatter, my old dreams are hid.
Chorus (I’ll sing this myself if you don’t mind.):
With a tooral-li-ooral, li-ooral, li-ay!
I’d burst into tears if you all went away ;
But I sit on the lid and pretend I am gay,
With a tooral-li-ooral, li-ooral, li-ay I

The profit figures in the last three lines
would look a good deal more uniform if 12
months ago the directors hadn’t cut out
£5500 and put it to a suspense account, not
knowing what the politicians were going to
do about war-time profit taxation. Now
they say that the taxation won’t be as
“drastic” as was at first anticipated. “It
is, however, thought advisable to continue
the suspense account, which can be utilised
for any unforeseen taxation, and for equal-
isation of dividends if necessary.” So this
amount written off may yet be restored to
the table. What happened prior to, say,
1912 isn’t much guide to the future of the
co. Early in that year the Queensland
manager was appointed to the Board and a
share register was opened in Brisbane.
Later in the year, on Mr. Rich’s death, the
Brisbane manager, L. LI. Spence, was
appointed managing director. The idea was
that N. S. Wales was overcrowded with
strong people in the business, and there was
more room up north. The N. S. Wales
assets were gradually got rid of, and the
proceeds used to finance the business in
Queensland; and by the end of 1915 “the
co.’s interests in Sydney” were “confined to
the collection of certain p.n’s as they fall
due, and the working of the bonded and
free stores at Circular Quay, which are
beginning to be fully utilised and are giving
a good return.” All the directors (bar one,
apparently, who is in London, where the
registered office still is) are Queenslanders ;
and they are a handy lot. The chairman
of the Q. N. Bank is chairman; and ship-
ping interests are well represented. That
and the figures for the past three terms look
very promising.
In other respects there have been many
changes. The co. in the old days, when
its customers were mostly in the droughtiest
parts of N. S. Wales, was heavily loaded
with debt; and it was paying no dividend
when the century was born. But it is now
almost free, and its liabilities are covered
three times over by liquid assets (they are
the “sundries” in the next comparison) :
Liabilities.— 1912. 1916. 1917.
Mortgages . . £21,350 £8,730 Nil
Other debts .. 20,030 14,609 £13,062
Freeholds, etc... 59,678 63,517 63,239
Book debts . . 93,817 79,585 72,466
Stock . . . . 86,110 77,711 64,928
Sundries .. 6,821 20,082 39,995
For several years past the squatters, big
and little, have been having a rattling good
time ; and, though the outlook is bright, they
can’t expect to escape knocks in the future.
The liquid assets are bound to disappear then
as credit has to be extended. But the co.
has given proof that it has learned its les-
son. The directors say :
While it is impossible to forecast the future, share-
holders may rest assured that care will be exercised
in the conduct of the business, and the distribution
of dividends will be guided by the policy of keeping
good cash reserves to maintain the financial stability
of the co.
Following that policy the co. ought to have
a very profitable future. Over-trading,
dangerous (and alluring) everywhere, is
more dangerous (and more alluring perhaps)
in this back-country business than almost
anywhere else, because reverses come there
so suddenly and one never knows what back-
ing the business’s best customer may require
next year. Therefore shareholders who
may feel inclined to grumble at the co. for
keeping heavy liquid balances in flush times
don’t know what is good for their health.
For the same reason the profit ought to go a
long way further before the dividend is put
up any higher.

That clumsy table tells the story of the sale
of the co.’s electrical business to the Gov-
ernment’s Hydro-Electrical Department, the
latter established on the wreckage of Gillies’s
Great Lake scheme. The sale was com-
pleted on Dec. 7, 1915. At that date and
for some years previously the capital was
£lOB,OOO in GOOO shares of £2O paid to £lB.
The co. made an excellent bargain. For
many years the electric light and power busi-
ness had been neglected, the co. being satis-
fied to do just enough to keep others out,
while making its own profit from gas. It
started to hustle a bit six years ago, and
instead of a consistent loss began to show a
profit on sales of current. The working
account for the half-year to June, 1915,
showed a surplus of £1839 ; and the capital
in the undertaking at that time was £60,698.
When the transaction with the Government
was completed the Electric Department
assets were replaced by one line, “Investment
account, £100,000,” and an apparent profit of
£55,482 was shown on the other side. The
capital, previously in £2O shares, was on
the strength of this divided into £1 shares,
and increased from £lOB,OOO to £150,000.
There still remains £12,859 of “Electrical
Department realisation account” money
among the reserves, which are made up this
way: Reserve fund, £10,340; insurance fund,
£7750; dividend equalisation reserve, £500;
and E.D. realisation account, £12,859. In
addition, and not reckoned as reserves in
the table, there are—Extension of works
fund, £7750; gasfitting account. £3OOO.
Apparently nothing is written off the works
out of undisclosed profits; but, though prob-
ably no undisclosed profit is being stuffed
away, no less than £5539 was spent during
the 12 months on “repairs, renewals, altera-
tions to plant and maintenance.” Last
year the directors wrote off all the
undivided profit r and if it was neces-
sary to do this in order to provide
for depreciation, not covered by renewals and
repairs, then of course the dividend was only
just earned. But in these days many
balance-sheets are drawn up with an eye on
the income-tax people, and shareholders are
expected to understand. There is, however,
no particular reason to suppose that this co.
is doing any better than it says it is. Nor
is there any reason to suspect that it will
make glittering profits in the future, for it
is in competition with the biggest hydro-
electric scheme in the Commonwealth, and
one that isn’t out after dividends. The
financial position is easy. Liabilities are
£25,900; and in addition to the land, plant,
mains and stock, the co. has £15,461 in book
debts and £72,450 in “investments,” mostly
Government stock issued in payment for the
electric business. So long as one-third of
the assets are Government stock shareholders
are doing very well indeed to get 7 p.c. They
are likely to get less before they get more.

The Farmers’ and Settlers’ Co-opera-
tive Insurance Co. of Australia. —This
co., formed in Sydney, with branches in Mel-
bourne and Adelaide, has tackled a section
of the big job of eliminating the middleman
who has been taking so large a slice out of
the earnings of the man on the land. It is
not only a big job ; it is a very difficult one
as well. In the comparatively closely-
settled North Coast district of N. S. Wales
the task is not so hard, and at least half of
the products of those parts are now handled
co-operatively ; but in the other parts of the
country—N. S. Wales particularly—the
farmer is thrown so much on his own re-
sources that he actually mistrusts co-opera-
tive effort, and pays dearly. So far this
co.’s figures are not in themselves good
enough to attract him. And they never will
be unless, having become interested in the
co., he relieves it of the expense of hunting
up his insurances. Last year, apart from
the capital spent in extending the business,
the exes, were £6360, and the net premiums
were £11,910; so that nearly 54 p.c. was
spent in getting the business and managing
it. The farmers, if they co-operated heartily,
could cut that down to 14 p.c. and save
£4750 on even that little bit of business.
And if they co-operated still more heartily
they could increase the total insurance ten-
fold and make a further reduction in the
cost of insurance. At present the farmers
of Australia waste tens of thousands a year
—probably a hundred thousand —in keeping
totally unnecessary canvassers flying around
the country in motor-cars and other vehicles.
Every penny spent that way is a penny they
might if they chose keep in their own pockets,
or use to give themselves and the missus a bit
more of the necessaries of life, not to speak
of its joys. The farmers’ and settlers’
societies, instead of leaving it to private
promoters, should have taken up this practi-
cal matter long ago, and saved some of the
time they waste over politics. They ought
to look up the records and find out what the
manufacturers have done in this direction.
They do their accident insurance for about
12 p.c.
Of course a thing of this kind needs some
capital behind it. But as State offices have
shown in Maoriland and elsewhere, the co-
operators themselves, if enough of them
agree to send along their business without
putting the co. to the expense of getting it,
will soon provide the necessary capital in
the shape of undivided profits. That, cer-
tainly, means a little self-restraint for a
start; but it would not necessarily mean any
self-denial, because they could still get their
insurance for what it is costing them now.
For the capital which the shareholders in
this co. have put up—so far £23,310 —
they are getting G p.c. Of the amount sub-
scribed and the undivided profit there is now
about £16,000 intact, mostly represented by
public securities and cash. The balance
has gone in extending the business. Whether
that is a good asset depends almost entirely
upon the extent to which the shareholders
stick to the co. and act as unpaid canvas-
sers for it. Last year’s profit was nothing
to enthuse about. Not only were the ex-
penses high, but the losses of this co., as
of practically every other co. taking hail-
storm risks, were exceptionally heavy. Never-
theless there was a surplus of £1553. The
6 p.c. div. will take about £l2OO. The bal-
ance goes to a reserve to cover unexpired
risks.
This question of co-operation to eliminate
the superfluous canvasser and agent and
many other middlemen is a national one
and it becomes very pressing. Australia
must produce more; and the elimination of
the superfluous will help in two ways—it
will liberate a small army of non-producers
and make production more attractive, be-
cause more remunerative. It is a national
disgrace and a national peril that thus far
the most profitable ventures in Australia
have been non-productive agencies to do ,
this, that and the other thing. It ought to
be the other way about —the productive con-
cerns ought to be the most profitable. And
Parliaments and patriots ought to use all
their efforts to make them so. If they don’t
—well, the future of this country, with its
huge burden of debt, the interest on which
can only be paid by production, is not going
to be very cheerful.

You can put that last line in another way
if you please. The directors say the profit
was £sSr>2. It is like this. The co.’s con-
cession expires in 1925, and, being managed
by people who like to do things in an orderly
manner, the co. used every year to put
something into a sinking fund for the repay-
ment of capital. Apparently there was a
discussion with the income-tax people, and
the sinking fund suddenly disappeared from
the accounts. There used to be an appro-
priation for “sinking fund and depreciation,”
and some or all of it went into “Sinking fund
investments.” Nowadays there is an appro-
priation only for depreciation. Last year
£2500 was written off plant, etc., but £9OO
has been added to “Investments.” The
balance-sheet really shows reserves of only
£1661. The other £11,864 is represented by
these “investments.” All but £2589 of it is
in public securities.
But it is quite possible that the co. has
done much better than even the last two
lines in the table show. In 1914 the assets
apart from fixed assets were £10.348; the
liabilities £3593. Surplus £6755. ’ The
floating assets are now £16,404, the liabili-
ties £2666; surplus £13,738. Increase
£6983 ; and meantime there has been a dis
tribution of £65G2. So in three years the
co. lias made (1) an 8 p.c. dividend, (•>)
sufficient to pay for all repairs and re-
newals and (3) £13,545 besides. If C;m
do that in three years, what can it do in
the eight that are left to it? The capital
is now £52,500, and as before stated the
assets (apart from plant, etc.) in excess of
liabilities amount to £13,738. It looks as
though, even if the co. had to pass every-
thing over in 1925 without payment, the
shareholders would come out with their
capital and 8 p.c. meantime. Certainly
gross profits are shrinking a bit (gross
revenue has gone down steadily from £2O 375
in 1912 to £18,539 last year). On’ the
other hand, with a repayment of half the
remaining capital, there may presently be
a reduction of dividend, with, of course
no corresponding reduction of earnings from
the business. What the case is with regard
to certain of the fixed assets this paper has
no information: it doesn’t know whether
the co. will have something solid to dispose
of, like the Tramway co. had. By a coinci-
dence Colin Templeton, who, as chairman
of the new Tramway Board, was the buyer
in that case, may, as a director of this co.
be the seller here —if there is anything to
sell.

This co. has a busy time ahead of it. To
the end of June it had supplied the Common-
wealth with 25,000 lines of automatics and
Maoriland with 1500; since the year closed
it had been notified of the acceptance of
7300 more lines, 1200 of them for Christ-
church (M.L.) ; and further large exten-
sions are contemplated in Sydney. So far,
though many of the suburbs have the auto-
matic system, the city has had the old sort,
but that is to end soon. The large orders,
the directors say, will tax the co.’s financial
resources ; but it isn’t likely to suffer incon-
venience on that score. All the same, the
directors paid only ban of the 10 p.c. divi-
dend at once —the balance is hung up for a
while. The time will no doubt arrive when,
with very few orders coining in, the profits
will be small; for there is, so far as can be
made out, no profit for this co. apart from
the actual supply and installation of the
wonderful little machines and their acces-
sories. But when that time comes the capi-
tal should be intact, because the co. is little
more than an indent agent. Of its capital
of £G2,500 goodwill still stands for £12,500;
stock, plant and book debts amount to no
more than £5038, so plant is a very harm-
less item. The balance is all cash or as good
as cash—deposits with the Automatic Elec-
tric Co. and others and British Government
securities (£30.000). Interest earnings alone
last year were £2723. In view of the nature
of the business it would be desirable to get
that goodwill item reduced, which can only
be done, of course, by hanging on to some of
the profits.

This benevolent brewery admits that to
June 30 it had not raised its prices suffici-
ently to meet increased costs. Also, WejSt-
ralia had not been as thirsty as usual. So
profits are smaller than in any other half-
year in the table. For a couple of years
Westralia lived riotously under a Labor
Government whose principal concern was to
borrow from the capitalist, and, of course,
the fill-’em-up-again industry benefited. Bid
John Scaddan made the pace too hot, and
the brakes were suddenly applied. Now the
people who yelled loudest against Labor
finance have a two-to-one majority in the
Assembly ; and, though Pearce’s State is at
present getting its share of war expenditure,
there is little likelihood of much splashing
of loan money in the next few years. In
addition, Westralia’s mining languishes, and

production in other directions has not been
sufficiently rapid to make good that loss.
\ll this means that the pint-pot will be
brought into action less frequently. Add to
that the possible curtailment of the number
0 f drink-shops or trading hours, and the
future of Fremantle Castlemaine is obvi-
ously uncertain.
Capital is £70,000, of which £lO,OOO was
got in three years ago. At June, 1012, the
co. owed £8145 “freehold and leasehold pro-
perties, plant and machinery, rolling stock,
goodwill, water-rights, etc.,” were set down
at £74,880, less £5863 provided for deprecia-
tion ; and more or less liquid assets stood at
£21,788. The co.’s liabilities now* total
£29,330; liquid assets are £20.784 ; and the
mixture of properties, plant, stock and froth
stands in at £136,268, against which there
is now a reserve of £21,288 for depreciation.
So, assuming that the increase in the depre-
ciation reserve covers all depreciation not
otherwise provided for, the co. is nominally
just under £14,000 better off than it was five
years ago. Every penny of that sum, how-
ever, has gone into the conglomerate of pro-
perties, plant and stock. How much to each
item The Bulletin does not know. During
the past year the co. went to the bank for
about £20,000, and all that, too, has gone
into the same mixture. But no matter where
all the new* capital, surplus profits and over-
draft have been invested, this much is per-
fectly clear: profits are sliding and the 5 p.c.
dividend is now being paid with a smaller
margin than the former 10 p.c. That is not
heartening.
* * + w
It is about time the Win-the-War
Government proceeded to investigate the
matter of industrial metals and the smelting
thereof. Hughes, when he made the mono-
poly that he is apparently proud of. knew
all about the predilections and character-
istics of monopolies when in possession of
absolute power. In his pre-“Liberal”
days it was understood that thwarting and
curbing the natural rapacity of monopolies
was his abiding desire. Yet the smelting
ling which he has created has practically
unrestricted power to do as it likes. Any-
one who is inclined to regard the ring as a
beneficent and benevolent monopoly had
better get hold of an industrial metal mine
and do a little dealing with it. Memories
of the manner in which the copper trust of
U.S.A. acquired its immense hold on copper
production are beginning to disturb many
Australian mine-owners and mine-managers.
If it is still necessary to prevent our metals
being sold except through one source —and
it is still impossible, allegedly in the inter-
ests of the Empire, even to allow a British
co.' operating mines and treatment works
in North Queensland to ship its concen-
trates direct to its own refining works in
England—if, in short, it is still considered
necessary to assist our mining industry by
restricting the channel through which its
products may be disposed of, then the least
Hughes might do is to see that that channel
is under proper supervision and that the
smaller mining men are adequately safe-
guarded. If the present smelting combine is
to continue to have control of the industrial
smelting metals of Australia, the combine
and its methods in turn must be brought
under strict control, and its methods regu-
lated and its charges and profits limited.
“Exile’s” suggestion concerning Victoria’s
brown coal deposits :
A committee of four experts has reported to the
t ictorian Government suggesting a scheme to gener-
ate electricity on the spot at Morwell and convey it
to Melbourne, 90 miles away, at a cost of nearly
£2,000,000. To the onlooker, however, it appears
as though the business is being undertaken at the
wrong end. The existing coal famine proves that
Victoria needs fuel more urgently than it does
power. The first thing to do with brown coal is to
turn it into a fuel that will burn anywhere and
everywhere that black coal burns. Sequentially,
after making brown coal fit to burn in furnaces,
stoves or fireplaces, it will be the easiest of simple
matters to use it for making electric juice. It is
incomprehensible that nearly everybody who has
tackled the brown coal question in Victoria, from the
late State Geologist James Stirling, 30 years ago,
until to-day, seems to think it is necessary to ex-
periment on the coal, to make extensive tests, to
pursue a scientific plan of chemical research. All
the while, nearly everything is known about brown
coal in Central Europe worth knowing. There is no
need to spend £25,000, as the Victorian Government
is about to do. The varied uses of brown coal have
been practically and profitably employed for over
35 years. It should cost the Government very little
to learn how to use it, how to burn it, how to
briquet it, and how to retort it for gas. The first
thing the Germans do with brown coal is to briquet
it at a cost of six marks, or about 6s. a ton. It
takes two tons of brown coal to make one ton of
briquets. In 1915 Germany mined 88,000,000 tons
of brown coal and used 40,000,000 tons to produce
20,000,000 tons of briquets. The other 48,000,000
tons were used to make tar and oils, and were burnt
under boilers, both locomotive and stationary. From
the tars are extracted aniline dyes and benzine, and
the toluene bases of high explosives and numerous
chemicals. Special grates are needed to get the most
heat possible out of the coal. All which cau be
done to da> in South Australia, which possesses fine
brown coal deposits near Adelaide, and in Victoria
which has the biggest brown coal field in the world
right underneath Melbourne. Why not begin by
briquetting brown coal at Altona, nine miles from the
wii\- Melbourne > or at Lai Lai, 14 miles from
Ballarat, where another vast brown coalfield lies
idle because nobody thinks of making bricks out of
the coal which will burn and which are as easily
made as clay bricks and more cheaply. It seems
bad finance to start a huge scheme at Morwell, 90
miles from Melbourne, to cost £2,000,000 or so,
when a beginning can be made by building
the unit of a future plant only nine miles from
Melbourne for one-tenth of the money. There is one
particular American briquetting machine working on
a large scale at Altona which has made excellent
briquets out of Victorian brown coal without using
a binder of tar or pitch, and merely relying on the
moisture contained in the coal. There is positively
no difficulty about manufacturing briquets for
3s. to 10s. a ton, saleable at 20s. in the city.
When this is done, Victoria will not be so helplessly
dependent on Newcastle.

Dalmayne Collieries (Tas.) was formed in
tatter part of 1914 with a capital of
£125,000, of which £60,000 —55,000 fully-paid
shares and £5OOO in cash—was paid to the
vendors and promoters—a solid price for an
undeveloped property without even a road
and miles from a railway and the coast. The
response to the public brought in only about
£20,000. That sum, of course, could not go
far towards opening-up, developing , and equip-
ping a mine which had also to provide means
of transport from the pit to the coast. It
was not long, therefore, before funds were
exhausted; so £20,000 of debentures were
issued, for which a bonus of 50 fully-paid
shares was offered for each £lOO debenture
taken up. This enabled the co. to make
some progress and instal an aerial ropeway
to convey the coal from the pit’s mouth to
the loading jetty erected by the Tasmanian
Government at Piccaninny Point, about four
miles from the pit. There was talk of this
ropeway having a carrying capacity of 200
tons per hour, but 50 tons per hour seems to
be nearer the mark. Recently a further
issue of £35,000 of debentures has been made,
presumably to redeem the former issue and
leave, a surplus to meet further capital out-
lay. Having reached the producing stage
the question of markets arises. The whole of
the local consumption is practically in
the hands of the two existing mines
at Fingal, the Mount Nicholas and the
Cornwall, which have a mutual working
arrangement whereby the one supplies the
northern and the other the southern part of
the island; and both these mines have the
advantage of direct railway communication
with the Fingal line and so to the main line.
It is very unlikely that the Dalmayne Col-
liery can expect to s ure more than a small
proportion of the local trade, seeing that all
its coal will be sea borne. Apparently it
will have to look farther afield for markets,
and in Victoria and South Aus. it will
have to compete with the superior coals of
N S. Wales. So it must either produce a
coal having quality to recommend it, or sell
at a price that will be tempting. As to
quality, Dalmayne can be called only a
fairly-good second-class coal, having 13 p.c.
to 16 p.c. of ash. Altogether the prospects
of the co. reaching the dividend-paying
stage for some time to come appear remote.

Brushing away excuses, the plight of Y
Water, Emmaville (N.S.W.), has been high
costs, low values and insufficient stuff. To
treat under lb. tin oxide ground and get
efficiency, Moline’s new plant must be kept
on the go three full shifts. But it has been
working only two-thirds time until the past
fortnight, so 262,000 yards were treated
for the half-year ending July 31, instead
of something in the vicinity of 350,000 cub.
yards. This dirt averaged 0.8371 b. per cub.
yard against 0.7531 b. in the previous term,
but with tin at nearly £225, as against £lBl,
there was a profit of £147. The co.’s financial
position bears token to the presence of the
banker, as apart from the usual running debt
of about £2OOO, Cohen is owed £21,819.
Liquid assets total £22,784, of which tin on
hand and sundry debtors amount to £14,751,
stores and a big pile of fuel, £7958; so, finan-
cially, things are not really so bad. The
barge is now dredging up stream on a new
site, where values are better.
Australian dredging records are being
made by Adelong Estates (N.S.W.). In
August the co.’s two plants recovered 1184 oz.
gold, of which No. 2 plant got 8690 z.; for Sep-
tember 13020 z. (No. 2 dredge 878 oz.) ; and
for the first fortnight in October 8340 z. (No.
2 dredge 6750 z.). Deduct from the total of
33200 z. llOOoz. for costs, and the co. made
about £9OOO profit for 11 weeks’ work.
Meantime, Adelong Creek averaged about
120 oz. for the same period. Yet it pays
out a shilling div. in company with its fat
neighbor. It looks as if the smaller show is
living pretty well up to its income.

After having been shut down for about 40
years, the Apsley copper mine, in the Rock-
ley (A.S.W.) district, is starting business
again. Ihe show was nrs opened up half
a century back, when Sloman and Croaker
risked their cash. Peechey, who has now
taken over the venture, has succeeded in get-
ting all the water out of the way and com-
menced production.

Twelve months’ work has put £49,535 into
the till of Pioneer (Tas.) tin, run by
Libbs Bright’s Melbourne oflice. Taxes
swallowed £2296 of this and the Bright-
Miller-Harvey-Patterson Board and staff
mopped up an equal sum to compensate for
the brain-rack of knowing that Cecil Ryan
was on the spot. To pay ss. (id. a share in
divs. took all_ the net profit of £44,59.3, save
a trifle of £;>.»!, which goes to reserves. The
leal cash position on June 30 was comfort-
unsold being £12,726, stores
£lslo. and cash £4595, against £982 sundry
creditors. Here is the record of this money-
making deep-lead mine:—

A .windfall of 140,000 cub. yds. of pay dirt
was picked up in ground labelled unpayable,
thus conserving reserves; but it is Ryan’s
way to have a bit tucked away somewhere.
Lven when blasted by lightning or swept by
storms, as of late, his supply of spares
baffles even Nature’s nasty knocks. Costs
are kept low by his electro-hydraulic scheme,
which gives him power for .052 d. per unit. As
a side-show the Pioneer sluices the Argonaut
flat near St. Helen’s, east of the Blue Tier.
It is a shallow, tough go, and costs run out
about 6d. per cubic yard. Since 1913 Ryan
has lifted 213 J tons tin oxide out of this
bit of a terrace, and, although the average
has only been 0.91 b. of oxide per cubic vard,
a good deal more than axle-grease has'been
earned.

Since the mill started King Island Schee-
hte has improved the value of its concen-
trate from 68 p.c. to 73 p.c. of tungstic acid.
The mill is now crushing over 2(X) tons of
crudes per week, and the output of three to
four tons of high-grade concentrates should
give a substantial profit. At 50s. per unit
a 72 p.c. wolfram or seheelite concentrate is
worth £lBO per ton. Mt. Carbine (Q.) and
King Island (Tas.) are now the two most
important wolfram mines in the Common-
wealth, and both produce clean concentrates
that command a ready sale. Tne shows at
Wolfram Camp (N.Q.) also produce bismuth
and molybdenite, so they are quite distinct
from milling propositions that give wolfram
alone. For the quarter to June 30 Tas-
mania produced wolfram valued at £10,042
and bismuth worth £305; Queensland pro-
duced wolfram concentrates worth £18,443
and wolfram-bismuth concentrates worth
£11,484.

The manager of the recentlv-formed
Briseis Central (Tas.) states that bore-hole
prospects show 1.31 b. of tin oxide per cub.
yd. and lie confidently anticipates costs at
3d. per yd. At that figure costs would be the
lowest in Australasia. The Pioneer (Tas.)
has occasionally got costs down below 4d.,
but for the last 12 months the aver-
age for over a million yards was 4.7 d. Tin
oxide has recently been worth Is. 3d. per lb.,
so pound dirt will stand heavy costs.
Briseis Central may talk about rich bore-
hole prospects, but the parent Briseis and
the old Pioneer have been hungering for
pound dirt in a workable area for several
years past.

The clean-up at the Tasmania, Reacons-
field (Tas.), is as slow as pushing the Huns
out of Flanders. A dump of 121.000 tons of
tailings still have to be handled, and a lot
of plant remains to be sold. The gold in
the tails is about 19,0000 z., so it is an
allurement to the metallurgist. Last year’s
receipts worked out at £23.201, and ‘ sales
of plant, etc., brought in £3492. The profit
was £5602, to which can be added
snicked out of the March clean-up, and
in slags and ashes. But why should
these, have to be shipped to London for
treatment?

The Neville. Kooboora, which in its hey-
day was the richest wolfram show in North
Queensland, is to be given another trial. The
shaft is only a couple of hundred feet deep,
and the fact that wolfram has been got in
the Vulcan at 1000 ft. is encouraging the
search for tungsten metals at depth in the
Neville.

“Platman” : A good wolfram lode has been
opened up 20 miles west of the Musgrove
telegraph station (Cape York), but work
has been restricted for want of capital. I
had a look over the Peninsula about five
years ago, and the best prospecting area
for wolfram I have ever seen was the old
Bowden field on the Pascoe. The deepest
shaft is 30ft.. and over 65 tons of wolfram
were taken off the surface.
Queensland got a shock when it heard that
its largest gold-mine, the Scottish (lymph*,
was closing down, and that Mackay was
without eras, all for want of the usual coal
supply from N. S. Wales. There are mil-
lions of tons developed and partly developed
within easy distance of the Queensland coast.
But, curiously, inland collieries right in the
tropical zone have been the most progressive.
Or, rather, the less unprogressive.

“Wart”: Some Launceston people are

A shipment has been sent to Launceston, and
is said to be turning out well. Many years
ago a Sydney co. put up works at the old
lead mine at Leonardburgh, and success-
fully treated a considerable quantity of
oxides. But it had to put up the shutters
because the foreigner had too strong a foot-
ing in the local market.


HOME-MADE HAIR GROWER
that does marvels.
During the last few years announcements
have appeared occasionally telling how to
make a really good hair tonic that would
actually make the hair grow, and it gives us
great pleasure to learn that so many who
have tried it having obtained such remark-
able results. One lady writes that immedi-
ately after reading the formula she went to
her chemist and had him put up as directed,
loz. of Lavona de Comnosee, dram Men-
thol Crystals, and 3oz. Bay Rum. She took
this home, and, although her hair had been
falling out terribly and she was threatened
with baldness, she was astonished and
delighted to note that the falling out of the
hair soon stopped, and the hair itself began
to grow in an amazing manner. In fact, she
states that it has already grown nearly Sin.
in a little over two months. Moreover, her
hair .is now brighter, glossier and more
luxuriant than ever and is still growing. She
rubbed the tonic into the roots twice a day
tor the first three weeks, but now applies it
only once a day. It is especially interesting
to note from this and other reports that this
home-made hair-grower not only makes the
hair grow most marvellously, but it also
destroys the dandruff germ and keeps the
hair roots and scalp in a perfectly healthy
and normal condition.—Advt.

Sydney, October 15, 1917.
My Dear Arini, —
You’ll remember that Maoriland’s ex-
Governor Ranfurly lost his only son, Vis-
count Northland, in France in 1915. The
young man’s will attracted some attention
for its statement that “he would consider
the re-marriage of his w’idow an honor rather
than as casting a slur on his memory.” The
lady, who had then two young children, did
marry again in the early part of this year,
the second choice being Commander Geoffrey
Mills, R.N.V.R. He died a few weeks ago
in England from heart failure after a severe
operation.
Governor-General Ferguson and Governor
Galway have been giving evidence of their
artistic sense by purchasing some of Hey-
sen’s wonderful bushscapes.
French soldiers on furlough last week
stepped ashore on a gorgeous Australian
day, with tanned faces and their blue uni-
forms tinted here and there with army deco-
rations. Captain Le Floch was in command,
and Consul Chayet gave the fraternal wel-
come to his compatriots. The French soldier
on leave is groomed to a hair. Not the
eighth of an inch of his gear is out of regula-
tion composition. After two or three years’
active service these men landed as fresh as
paint, as if, in fact, they had just come from
a pleasure trip to Paris. The useful Han-
bury Davies (handy man of the Red Cross
executive), V.A.D.’s in their best pinnies,
members of the French League, Mrs. Jim
Ashton (Red Cross) and a shower of flowers
and cigarettes greeted the gallant Frangois.
Just now he’s struggling through a mass of
social invitations.

summers. Stokes, A.M.C., on behalf of the

kind remarks, Prof. Stuart gave a one-
second address—“ Now to business!” Re-
sults will be gilt-edged, for the affair

under the brim of a wide summer hat, was
one of the chief raffle pirates. An awful

the Pudukota baby (great excitement) and
its fair-haired mamma, were amongst those
who also ran.
Weddings will out. Here’s the name of
one I couldn’t whisper last week. He's
Lieut. N. G. Roskruge, of the Australian
navy. The bride is Dorothy IJird, who comes
from Westralia. When Wilhelm began to
butt around Roskruge was in the merchant
service; but that was too tame, so he hustled
for an extra master’s certificate and
shipped to England to join the Flying Corps.
No go—the Navy wanted him more. The
name Roskruge has been known in Corn-
wall since the days of—well, since the days
of the first Cornish king.
Colonel Bob Owen, who commanded the
”rd Battalion in Gallipoli and was carried
shoulder high by his men when invalided
home, to Sydney with a badly-damaged leg,
has just lost his only son—that pathetic
and splendid message, “Killed in Action.”
The charming mother has a little daughter
left to soften the blow.
Rupert Minnett, architect, now in khaki,
is going to claim the girl of his heart at St.
James’s Church one evening this week. She
is Coral, of the well-known squatting
Maddrell family, up Braidwood way. After
a short honeymoon the happy man goes off to
the war.
The Lyous-Toohey wedding in London a
few weeks ago is followed by an aftermath
of sartorial trimmings now to hand. Bride
Eileen, a daughter of the late John Toohey,
M.L.C., good citizen, was clad in a wonder-
ful gown of chiffon, like a snowflake with
silver leaves at the foot. The ’groom, Cap-
tain Leon Lyons, A.1.P., hails from Bris-
bane. One of the Hughes girls, Yvonne,
was bridesmaid, and Geoffrey Hughes—now
a captain in the Royal Flying Corps—was
second best man.
The S’Australian Branch of the Navy
League (sec. Tyler hoists the signals) wants
a word in your ear. There is no limb of the
League in this hamlet. It respectfully re-
minds you that on October 20 (the anniver-
sary of Nelson’s death) Adelaide, with Mel-
bourne and Launceston on the same beat,
will doff hats (you can wave your best bon-
net !) in recognition of the heroic sacrifices
of the British navy—l9l4-T7. After the
war—when the Silent Service wipes the
North Sea spume off its oilskin—we can
chat about its deeds.
Marie Tempest has adopted a promising
young Australian, Frank Allenby. He is
understudying Graham Browne, and, by the
way, he made determined efforts to enlist
before a final “No” turned him down.
Cadet Donald Mcßeatli drops in from
Toronto. You’ll recall his violin in the
John McCormack concert co. The Sydney
boy—he’s still in the early twenties —is now
in the Canadian Flying Corps and training
hard. Part of a day’s grind includes gun-
nery, wireless, map-reading, photography
(from the clouds) and a few other little
things. He chuckles to find that hard work
in the open is making him a strong man, for
he was rejected for active service at least
twice before he was admitted to the Ambu-
lance Corps. Now he can dare the rigors
of aviation with the toughest. Donald says
he is engaged to “such a wonderful little
girl.” In his exuberance he forgets to men-
tion her name.
There’s a five-act romance in the career of
Lieut. M. ,T. Hillary, whose mother is at
present in Sydney. He and she were living
in 1916 at a South Yarra boarding-house, and
he had just got a commission in the Engi-
neers. In the same house was a gazelle-
eyed English girl, Edwyna Mary Hope, Avho
had come to Australia to earn her living as
a teacher, her two brothers having been
killed at Mons. In a press interview, printed
a little later, she told how when war broke
out she and some girl friends were arrested
while travelling in the Harz Mountains, in
Germany. Eventually she was deported to
London, where she learned of her brothers’
fate. Yes, you’ve guessed it. There was a
wedding, and then Hillary was off to Meso-
potamia. This year the S. Australian lad
(he was born at Carrieton) was mentioned
in General Maude’s despatches, and latest
news is that he has won the D.S.O.
Mrs. Holman is home again, but every-
body can’t get over the dragon in the
way. There’s a young Englishwoman
still here because the military authorities
won’t let her get back to her people. They
are all on the other side. Her husband has
gone off on duty, and she is alone and in
uncertain health. Yet no one forgets the
ease with which the Premier’s lady and her
sister went off on a pleasure trip, slipning
like buttered eels through the passport sieve.
And there are others.
Organist Lilian
Frost, since the war,
has also been at the
piano whenever a
helping hand was
w’anted at a patri-
otic show. This
need not incite or-
ganisers to make a
w’ild rush for this
gifted musician’s
spare dates. She has
none. Up to 1919
she is about fully en-
gaged for as many
camp concerts and
side-shows for sol-
diers as any one
woman can hope to
get through. Laun-
ceston (Tasmania)
claims her. but for years she has belonged to
N.S.W. She is the organist at the Pitt-
street Congregational Church, but the public
know her best at the great instrument in
the Town Hall. As a youngster Lilian
studied in London for three years under
masters of the organ. I n ' 1912. she
made another trip to Europe to polish up
afresh. On this occasion Dr. Alcock. of
Westminster Abbey, now organist at Salis-
bury Cathedral, gave her lessons, and in
Paris she had a supplementary course from
the famous M. Charles Marie, of St. Sulpice.
In Sydney she rarely escapes without a recall
when the Towm Hall instrument sighs or
thunders under her persuasive hand. Yet
she never can be the city organist unless the
aldermanic law of “no women need apply”
is repealed. Meanwhile she is one of the
busiest women in Sydney.
When the old-fashioned photo.-man had
fixed his victim’s head in an iron clamp he
used to murmur, “Not too much prominence
to the hands, if you please!” The mid-
Victorian painter was also a little shy or
these difficult extremities. Our own John
Longstaff emphasised the feminine hand, as
in those meekly clasped in front of the
famous “Lady in Black.” At the recent
International Society’s Show, _ George
Lambert, according to a London critic who
heaps melted butter on the Australian,
“takes a whimsical interest in the hands
of his fair sitters. In the adorable portrait
of Miss Helene Beauclerk she is depicted in
the act of putting on her glove. His por-
traits are as much decorations as they are
likenesses of strangely fascinating people.”
T. J. McMahon, now' gently simmering in
the Solomon Isles, sends an informative line
to say that, thanks to the courtesy of the
Planters’ Association, everyone extends the
most generous hospitality. White women who
have the pluck to live in some of the more
remote plantations make a wonderful differ-
ence to the life of an isolated community.
There is, McMahon remarks, the frequently-
met native w T ife. Some of these dusky
matrons send their children to various Aus-
tralian schools and colleges. The strike in
Australia has hit the island planters very
hard. “While I write the harbor of Gizo
is full of traders’ boats wmiting for the
belated steamers—now a month over date
(Sept. 21) —to take their stuff away.”
This classic profile
belongs to Blamire
Young - the artist
who makes the prose
of a Darling Harbor
wharf a poem in
blue-grey. Now Staff-
Sergeant and In-
structor at Salis-
bury Plains, he en-
listed when war
broke out, though
over the regulation
fighting age. Aus-
tralia first met him
in the schoolroom.
That was in 1885,
when a young mathe-
matical master, B.A.
of Cambridge, taught
at the N. S W.
Katoomba College. The head in those days
was J. W. Fletcher. Since then Blamire
Young has scrawled his signature at the
foot of many exquisite impressions of Aus-
tralian scenery. Our Art Gallery Trustees
unfortunately allowed the best of his work
to pass into private hands. But even his
second-best, which hangs in the water-color
section —there are some Conrad Marten’s
early Sydney studies near by—is full of deli-
cate fantasy. Melbourne remembers this
poet-artist in the ’9o's when he was doing
mundane posters to advertise somebody’s
grocery or ham store.
To help the Hospice for the Dying (Dar-
linghurst) there’s to be a big matinee in
the Tivoli on Oct. 30. I was going to men-
tion that Hugh D. Mclntosh is lending the
house, but perhaps that’s superfluous.
Now that the veil, so to speak, is removed
from the submarine mine located on the
Sydney-Melbourne route by our sweepers,
perhaps the Censor won’t mind this. When
the Stricklands left Sydney their steamer
had to make a detour of nearly 100 miles to
dodge hidden compliments from Berlin.
Mrs. Trueblood, who, with her Michigan
professor, is sampling Australian scenery,
was speaking about a trip they had to Cuba.
“We thought we’d like to have a home there
to go to in the severest part of the winter.
‘Why. yes.’ said a friend, ‘we've got just
the place you’d like—a lovely farm. We
want to sell it, because when we left it last
time there happened to be a revolution. The
whirling insurgents smashed our furniture,
stole our cat and burnt our crops. How t-
ever, those are mere details. There’s no
revolution just now—and we’d Jove to sell
the place to you !’ We excused ourselves
and wintered in Michigan.”
The Joan of Arc committee, with the tire-
less Mrs. Boult in charge, are wrinkling
their foreheads. It’s the usual knotty argu-
ment, “How to raise the wind?” Christmas
gifts for the widows and orphans of soldiers
killed in action is the objective.
The V omen s Hospital (Crown-street)
sends up a cry for help. Fifteen thousand
little Australians have opened their eyes in
this haven for poor mothers. Dr. MackeUar,
not given to reckless praise, savs. “It is
surpassed by no other institution' of a sim-
ilar kind in the Commonwealth.” Just now
the directors are beating every bush to raise
£5OOO (the Government cow is dry). Some
or the young mothers in the hospital are
widows of soldiers. Send your mite. R. S.
Wickham is hon. treas.
Lieutenant E. B. (Houston, who died of
wounds in Flanders lately, was a second-
year medical-student at Sydney Uni. when
he enlisted last year, and was sent to Dun-
troon to qualify for a commission. After
a further course in machine-gunnery in the
Cold Country he went to France with one
star, and won a second at Messines. His
father, now deceased, w r as for many years
Scotchbyterian minister at Glebe Point
(Sydney) and a tutor in the Kirk’s divinity
college at Sydney Uni.
An Australian nurse, Matron Maud
McCarthy, daughter of a former N. S. Wales
solicitor, has again been “mentioned” for
devotion to duty in France.
Verbrugghen and his friend Goll open
their Beethoven menu in the Conserva-
torium this week. The highbrows are secur-
ing seats for the whole banquet, which trail*
out till October 22.
The late Arthur Fisher Lloyd’s will has
been proved at £27,972. He died at Samares
Itose Bay, a few weeks ago.
What will you do with your stripes? This
is the latest all-important question of the
smart-costume builder when you see about
an alleged simple summer frock. One of
the very occasional barrel outfits at the
Randwick Spring meeting had the stripes on
the skirt in horizontal lines, while the bodice
markings were perpendicular. The result
would set Fido barking if he saw it comin°-
up the front path.
A war fete at quiet, rose-trimmed Strath-
field brought in the remarkable sum of fltiOO
according to the affidavit of the lion, trea-
surer. A “Breton” party, girls in French
caps and frills, were the coaxers, and their
clean-up is not far off a record for a garden
fete. It was at Luleo.
Marjorie Williamson Lindsay Browne and
her captain are due back from their Hono-
lulu trip in a week or tw r o.
Mrs. Harry Henderson (better known as
Maggie Knight) is dangerously ill. A very
sudden attack necessitating an immediate
operation.
The C. E. Waters (he is a merchant, and
when in khaki captains a motor-car sec-
tion) have bought St. Mervyns, the Double
Bay place lately owned by the Ted Simp-
sons and recently inhabited by the Earps.
The Alec Hays are back. Their search
for news of Mrs. Hay’s brother, Sydney
Burdekin, who has been missing since early
in the war, proved fruitless. Report had
said he was a prisoner in Germany.
The musical Kennedy family is back in
Sydney, after a 12 weeks’ Australian toflr
with Balboni as the Voice. They brought
back from Adelaide, as pianist," Dorothy
Mcßride, a Mus. Bac. of the sainted city’s
Ccnservatorium. They open here in the
Verbrugghen Music House about the end of
the month.
Spring frivols brought the long bead neck-
let, once so dear to small hostesses at dolls’
parties, into great publicity. They are
decorative accessories when the ornament is
of delicate amber (at a rousing price) and
falls from a white neck on to a soft dark
frock; but they are unhandy things for
ordinary wear. A long string of beads fall-
ing into your soup while the haughty serving
duchess who wears them reaches you the
cruet, is not conducive to mutual good
feeling.
Major Arthur Morris, A.M.C., and Mrs.
Morris are expected home. He's had two
years’ active service in the healing depart-
ment of the great smash up. They lingered
in U.S.A. on the way to Sydney.
The late G. L. Fuller, of Iviama. father of
oil]' Acting-Premier, left £155,928. The
estate goes mainly to the children of the
testator, the sons getting about £30,000 each.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

LOOK FOR
THE WORD~
“ Pianola. ”
IT IS THE PIANOLA that most people have in mind when they
set out to buy a player-piano. For this is the only instrument
ot the type approved by the music profession—the world’s
leading musicians and music educators.
Yet, through a mere confusion of terms, it sometimes happens
that people who think they are buying the Pianola actually secure,
instead, a less-known and inferior instrument.
The Cause for Confusion.
The word “Pianola” has become so well known—has attained such
celebrity—that many people suppose it to be a term for all so-called
player-pianos.”
\ erv few of the Pianola’s imitators care to correct this mis-
take. Hence, if one does not learn the truth before he buys, he
may purchase any player-piano, and believe, until it is too late, that
he has bought the genuine Pianola.
Learn the Truth Now.
“Pianola” does not mean any player-piano. It is a trade-
mark—the name of an instrument made only by the Pianola
Company—the largest manufacturers of musical instruments in the
world, and pioneers of the “player” industry.
Ihe Pianola offers musical values and musical enjoyment
impossible with any other instrument.
It is not a “Pianola” unless the word “PIANOLA” is actually
on it.
THE GENUINE PIANOLA can be obtained only in the
following world-famous Pianos:—The Steinway, Steck, Stroud
Aeolian, and the English-made Weber.
It is not necessary to pay cash to secure a Pianola. Our
easy terms ot payment, consisting of a moderate deposit and
monthly instalments, bring the Pianola within reach of all buyers.
if unable to call, write for new Pianola Catalog.
11 e will gladly mail a copy free of postage.

Melbourne, October 15, 1917.
My Dear Yarrie. —
The weather for Guineas Day worried the
woman who had new Spring clothes to show
off. It looked as if a rainstorm might do a
turn after the north wind had finished its
dust-driving; so only a few heroines came
out in their up-to-the-moment rags. Mrs.
Leslie Macdonald brightened the landscape
with alarming plaid silk stockings below her
short kilted skirt. Mrs. William Leonard
was smartly and sensibly gowned in tailored
taffetas which shook off the dust. Mrs.
Clive Leonard wore a dainty tub muslin.
Miss Ball wore a rig—yes, a rig—of grey
cloth and blue silk. Fan Dango Mackay
enhanced the landscape under a huge droop
hat dotted with giant daisies. Mrs. Eric
Connolly looked cool under a shady draped
hat. She wore also a frock of navy blue.
Mrs. Geoff. Syme was in mole and grey. She
had a hat, too—a big brown straw one. (Big
hats are to be a craze this summer.) One
of the Flemington Glass dames adorned her-
self in salad green in wide flares. Dulcie
MersOn Cooper attended in a cool grey
gown. That will give you an idea what a
representative gathering it was.
Amongst the special constables sworn in
to deal with street rioters were Morris
Phillips and diamond-merchant Rene
Vanderkelen. These gentle sleuths carry
dinky little wooden batons that would be
splintered by one smash from a rolling-pin.
Pasteboards big as a hospital sheet and
marked with a big Red Cross are out for
the ball that will bounce on October 31.
All the available Governors have been en-
gaged to appear, and the Maddens,
Hennessys, Hugheses, Creswells, Pearces
and Cooks and other ex-unionists will lend
a foot.
Mrs. Rupert Boyd, whose husband is away
on military duty, nearly gained a fortune
and certainly lost one in a brief week.
Bachelor brother-in-law Harry Boyd, of
England, died very suddenly. He had made
a will leaving all he possessed to the wife
of his favorite brother Rupert, although he
had never met her. In the midst of her
tears and anticipations came unexpected
news that a very recent will had been found
whereby the money was diverted to another
lady:—a spinster.
I’m told that baronet Rupert Clarke is
building a house in Sydney, where he will
shelter until daughter “Possie” and her
soldier-husband arrive to take it over for a
time.
Herbert Power is angry about gout, which
complaint lately seized upon both his feet
and forced him to give up his racing engage-
ments. Youngest son Vivian, out of hospi-
tal, has returned to the trenches. Mean-
while Reggie Power is with British cavalry
n Salonika waiting for advice of his immi-
nent captaincy.
The Clive Leonard pair are back from the
Sydney races, and Mrs. Clive is looking for-
ward to the return of sister Phyllis Rey-
nolds, who is on her w T ay home from Eng-
land.
Stapley, the embryo Gaud Mayor, has a
fine tenor voice. He fluted sweetly in St.
John’s, Toofiak, for many years. Incidentally
the young people are in for a jolly time
when Mayoress Stapley—a delightfully
motherly woman—begins her reign. She is
a clever musician, like the Hennessy dame.
The magnificent Dr. Klatchko is patrolling
the Block once more after an interlude in the
country, during which he produced a
“leetle book,” now in the publishers’ hands.
The work has a shuddersome title, “Teeth
and Old Age.” The author, doctoring for
two years in Egypt, was amazed at the
wonderful vitality and strength of the Aus-
tralians, but horrified by their unsound
tusks.
Nurse Mary Sullivan, 70 years young,
recently asked to be relieved of the matron-
ship of the Ararat Hospital. This grand
woman was appointed in ’7O, after having
had six years’ experience at the Melbourne
Hospital. For her skill as a nurse and
devotion to her profession, Matron Sullivan
is much honored.
Major Stewart, who has a steady job as
military secretary to the G.-G., has been
promoted to hon. Lieut.-Colonel for “meri-
torious home service” in Australia. Stewart,
who has seen fire in India and S’Afriea,
volunteered at the outbreak of this war for
active service abroad, but, like too many more
who were eligible and willing, was retained
for home work. Mrs. Stewart is now here
and a special home is being built for them
in Federal Government House grounds.
Among pressmen the Major is known as the
official who keeps every promise. They can t
say anything better of a man than that.
The Ball Australian, arranged by the
Ilyams sisters, was the success of this patri-
otic season. Close on IUUO people turned
up to trample one another’s toes in the
capacious St. Kilda Town Hall, and a flock
of social heavyweights looked on from the
dais.
Mrs. Alfred Deakin has been busy at her
old post at the Base Hospital since return-
ing from her travels. She and her helpers
have no committee, and therefore no time-
wasting committee meetings. Also, they are
always quite financial, and have never yet
had to beg a penny or issue an appeal for
funds. Visitors see the work that is being
done without fuss or advertisement and fork
out subscriptions. An anonymous enthusi-
ast (a man) wrote a cheque for £2OOO the
other day. The workers are established just
inside the gates of the Base Hospital (they
have been there since the first invalids were
discharged), and they supply the outgoing
patients with suits and other needful, things.
Clothes are sent to the depot in the
usual old-clo’ style, and are thoroughly
cleansed, repaired and pressed. There are
lockers according to size-measurements, and
small fitting-rooms where the men try on
plain clothes to replace the khaki handed in
on completion of service. The cheery work-
ers have always tea and sandwiches and time
for a friendly talk at one of the small tables
under the awnings. There is a private room
for the discussion of serious worries, and here
crowds of nerve-shattered men have had the
more immediate problems of life solved for
them.
Diminutive Arthur Donecker, the Savage
Club’s pet comedian, has gone off to the
Geishas. His last appearance was as corner-
man of the Savage Minstrel Show run by
Bert Bailey. Even if his performance would
not exactly cause Will Whitburn to chuck
his job, it showed humorous agility. Little
Arthur is not going to reorganise the Rus-
sian forces or take a garter to the Mikado,
but is simply doing his job for Dalgety s,
who have interests in “the East.” His good-
looking spouse, who was one of the singing
Mattingley family, stays behind to keep the

November 80 has been fixed as the last
day of the Miniature Picture Campaign in
aid of St. Vincent’s Hospital. The drawing
will take place on December 8. Then the
holder of the successful miniature will be
able to sell it to John Wren for £5OOO. John
made one condition, though—that the whole
500,000 miniatures are sold, otherwise he
will pay only £lOOO. The public of Aus-
tralia has to settle this little matter for
itself. If it gets busy and buys freely, not
only will St. Vincent’s benefit, but also the
holder of the successful miniature. Forty-
nine other miniatures will be bought by an
anonvmous soul, who will pay for them at
the rate of £l2O to £5. So everybody has
the chance of one of 50 prizes for a modest
bob. All money for tickets sold must be at
the hospital on or before November 80, other-
wise they will not be included in the draw-
ing.
Adelaide deponeth :
In gorgeous weather the Eight Hours’ sports and
procession and the second day of the S.A.J.C.’s Derby
meeting at Morphettville made us gay on Wednes-
day. The races, by the way, didn’t suggest that we
have got down to the last man and last shilling.
There were plenty of eligibles on the course; and
for the two days’ racing over £2OOO more went
through the totalisator than last year. The Labor
procession was a rather abbreviated affair in com-
parison with its predecessors, but whether that was
because of the number of trades-unionists who have
enlisted or because of the split in local Labor ranks
or merrlv due to fatigue I can’t tell you, and I m
sure you don’t care.
Ebenezrr Ward, who had been ill for some time,
died in Western Australia on Monday. In his 80
years he had tried his hand at journalism, play-act-
ing and politics, but strenuously dodged the career
designed for him by his parents, which was to
follow his father as a minister of the Baptist Church.
He began toil in London, at the age of 12, with a
job that gave him board and lodging and a shilling
a week, went to the Morning Post as reader’s boy
at 15s. a week, stayed there till he was 19, and came
to Australia three years later. Of his six sons three
are at the Front and one is a partner in the legal
firm that holds F. W. Young, Agent-General.
John Hill, one of whose sons is Clem of cricket
fame, had a golden wedding t’other day. The old
gentleman’s experience dates back to the very early
coaching days of the State, when he waved a whip in
conjunction with Rounsevell. To-day the only coach
left is the one that runs to Mt. Pleasant, and even
there the railway has crept to within six or seven
miles of the town.
Friday’s express brought us the Stanleys, who are
to stay at Government House for a week with the
Galways. It is an “unofficial” visit, so they won’t
have to work so hard.
Dorothea Proud, the Catherine Helen Spence
scholar who added a London D.S.Sc. degree to her
local B.A. just before war broke out and has since
then been working in the Welfare Department,
Ministry of Munitions, is to rank as a “commander
under the new Order of British Empire. When
Lloyd George organised welfare work in connection
with munition factories Miss Proud was called in
to give particular attention to the womens side ot
the question, and since then the scheme has ex-
panded out of sight of the original intention. As
senior inspector of women's welfare work Doro-
thea has visited most of the munition factories in
the United Kingdom, and altogether the Spence
Scholarship committee feels it is being done proud
in its newly-made C.B.E. Professor Bragg, once of
our University and now of the Board of Invention
and Research at the Admiralty, has got a similar
honor.
Charteris. of the Remington Co., has just
returned from his honeymoon. The lucky
man married Rene Murray, of Caulfield.
The Adela Pankhurst bridegroom is a
man of very dour countenace —elderly an
sensible, ye ken. Men who have looked at
Adela without prejudice vote her “quite a
charming little woman.” The male species
of interviewer was mostly bowled over by
her blue-eyed smile. When on active ser-
vice Adela used to drag her fair hair back
into a tight, uncompromising knot; but as
she shrieked her speeches she shook her
head, the pins flew everywhere and the
released hair was seen to be beautifully
curly.
Apparently some of our Billjims have the
vitality of cats. Sergeant G. T. Piper, a
South Yarra soldier, has been wounded nine
times. He was admitted to hospital at the
end of September to be soled and heeled for
the firing-line once more.
Put the Moyle family, of Neilborough
Hast, near Bendigo, on the honor-roll.
Mr. and Mrs. Moyle are represented
in the war zone by seven sons, whose
ages range from 27 to 19. Private
G. H. Moyle, age 22, enlisted at the co»n-
mencement of the war, has been four times
wounded, and is still in the firing-line. His
brothers Walter and Charles have both been
fighting for over three years and have been
twice wounded.
A “Russian” gent, who was prominent
till recently in Melbourne intellectual move-
ments has been arrested in San Francisco
as a German spy. They were after him in
Maoriland, but he slipped away; however,
the police received him with open arms at
’Frisco. Very pointed references to him
were made in Australia; but instead of
being put where he couldn’t do any harm
he was petted. Pearce was still at the
Defence Department.
The Russian Bureau of Trade, which
started off full of importance and good

intentions, with Billy
Hughes and other poli-
ticians pulling in
front and all sorts of
big commercial chiefs
shoving behind, is
now sitting down in
the middle of the road
scratching itself with
a handful of pens.
Consul d’Abaza is in
such a worry as to
whom he really does
represent in Australia
that he is alleged to
be preparing his resig-
nation. But who is
he going to send it to?
Gerald, elder hope of the George Army-
tages, has been lined up before the ranks to
receive a medal.
Lady Helen held the ribbons of a party in
the Masonic Hall last Wednesday, for the
benefit of the Friendly Union of Soldiers’
Wives. Colonel Cox-Taylor, D. 5.0., gave an
address, and the musical programme was
arranged by Mrs. Sellheim.
The Arthur Tueketts’ boy—Captain
Tuckett, M.C. —had to act the showman re-
cently in France. He was given the job of
conducting George Rex through part of the
lines during an inspection. Incidentally, the
little man has read the signs aright. You
don’t hear any references to “my army” in
these days.
Cases of men masquerading for purposes
of imposition as returned soldiers are not
unknown, but Melbourne has just had its
first experience of a young woman who posed
as a returned nurse. The Intelligence sec-
tion enlisted the aid of the new Bobberinas
and bowled her out. She became hysterical,
confessed, and was allowed to return, with a
harsh warning, to Tasmania. Melbourne
doesn’t approve of mendacious young things
who borrow the plumage of a Nightingale
to work, so to speak, on the Cross.
Four Australian nurses wear the military
medal. One of them is a Vic. girl, Sister
Alice Ross King, who, born in Ballarat,
received her training at Alfred' and Austin
Hospitals. She went to the front with the
first nursing unit, and, after one trip back
on a hospital ship, was attached to No. 1
A.G.11. in France. Her post was 20
minutes’ walk from the firing-line, at a
casualty clearing-station, on which Fritz
dropped three bombs. One blew the pneu-
monia tent to pieces, causing 18 casualties.
Had it fallen two minutes later, our dark-
haired Sister would have been on the list.
The tent had already been shell-punctured
that afternoon, and a fragment weighing
101 b. fell within inches of a patient’s face.
When the bomb came it killed him.
The Scotney-White pair descended on
Melbourne again last week and gave a
patriotic concert. Lady Helen filled a stall,
with Genthelp Kerr-Pearse in attendance.
Sassiety girls in mob caps sold sweets, and
the Festival Choir helped Scotney through
one very weak attempt. She wore a helio-
trope dress, very short, with a big sash-bow
turned to the front.
Tom Minogue, a dramatic baritone who
has appeared in Playhouse opera, gave a
recital at the Assembly Hall last week.
Jo»;sie McMichael and Harold Smith helped.
The latter massaged the piano. The Very
Best filled the house.
Melbourne artists are sending canvas evi-
dence across to the South Australian Society
of Arts, which will have its 20th annual
show early in November. Mrs. Withers has
despatched a selection of her late husband's
work. This will postpone for a time the
show she meant to have in Adelaide on her
own.
Rowell, a youth in his early twenties who
has been scene painting for King’s Theatre,
will exhibit landscape work in the Athenaeum
Upper Hall from October 23 to November 5.
He was a Gallery student who won distinc-
tion and married Eugenie Durran, another
artistic youngster. She goes in for portrait-
painting.
“The Pigeon” (Galsworthy), preceded by
“-Over the Hills.” will be put on at the
Playhouse on October 20. Mrs. Eccles,
Audrey Anderson and Doris Fitton, Hugh
MeCrae and David Low are cast. Gregan
McMahon and Hector Daniels are also in
the bill.
Maude was genuinely annoyed on Guineas
night, for “Grumpy” has probably never
played to a thinner Saturday house. Only
one box was occupied, and that by a flapper
tied up with pink ribands and escorted by
three young soldiers. In the last act
Dorothy Cumming was wearing a wide-eyed
look of fury, which didn’t match her pretty
new T gown of pink and lace, wflth its mauve
blue and pink waist-belt.
Hospital Button Day, with Mrs. Wool-
cott in command, is due on October 26. This
hold-up takes the place of the usual October
collections for Hospital Sunday. The Gaud
Mayor and his lady are rolling up their
sleeves, and the Hennessys are also well in
the working party, David being president.
Lindsay Russell, the Lara girl who made
money by writing novels with the Scarlet
Woman for chief villainess and then went
to England and married a Harley-street
doctor, is shortly to bomb London with “The
Autobiography of a Heretic: The Story of
My Life.” The publisher mentions (in strict
confidence, of course) that the book will be
“the literary sensation of the year.” They
always are.
A clever young lawyer-woman brought
herself under fire at the Lyceum Club the
other night while a committee meeting was
discussing the question of membership. The
rule allows membership only to women who
have achieved something in the intellectual
world. Mere budding genius is not acknow-
ledged. Some members, of whom the lady
lawyer was one. wanted the Buds to be
allowed in. Said our learned friend: “For
my part, I should like to see a little youth
and beau— life, I mean, introduced into the
Club.” The brutal truth was nearly out
that the intellectual she who has “achieved"
is mostly neither young nor beautiful, and
moreover is prone to accentuate her age and
plainness by drastic hairdressing and hor-
ribly sensible boots.
Sydney de Loghe is dowh from the North
with a new novel —“Pelican Pool.” Aus-
tralian publishers have taken it cheerfully
at a high figure and have given the young
author a solid sum to carry on with.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

ABSOLUTEEY'IT
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Wandi”: We have two birds that are
said to catch their food by paralysing it with
their hellish voices. One is the channel-bill cuckoo,
one of the largest of the tribe in the world (24in.
in length), whose call-note Gould describes as “a
frightful scream.” It follows the flood-waters
down from the Gulf to Koopa Creek and Lake Eyre
and is commonly called the flood-bird —in some
places the hornbill. The other uproarious party is
the powerful owl, or eagle-owl, whose loud, weird
screeches bursting suddenly upon the stillness of a
dense forest gully rise to an ear-splitting shriek.
It is the largest of Australian owls (24in.). Its
prevailing color is brown with whitish marks, and
its whispers arc heard intermittently throughout the
night about the Dorrigo scrubs : also hol e and there
in other parts of Eastern Australia, B, Aus. and
the Northern Territory, If these two birds were to
sing “The Devil’s Chorus” together they wculd stop
the war.
“Ornis” : That trees of the Leptospcnnuni
genus were called “tea-trees” because sortie Chump
used the leaves as a substitute for tea is, 1 think,
moonshine. One has only to chew a few leaves to
find them both bitter and astringent. I know that
tViddowson, in his “Present State of Van Diemen’s
Land" (published 1529), says: “The tea-tree grows
in wet situations and in clusters along the banks of
rivers and mountain streams; the leaves infused make
a pleasant beverage, and with a little sugar added
form a most excellent substitute for tea.” I have
a strong suspicion, however, that someone was p: lling
his leg, especially as a perusal of his book leaves the
impression that he was not of a type to try experi-
ments for himself. But, no matter how it got the
name “tea-tree,” the altering of it to “ti” was the
work of some fellow who was a better cabinet bot-
anist than bushinan. Evidently it hurt his feelings to
find a tree that had not even a bowing acquaintance
with the CameUianat, the order to which the tea-plant
proper belongs. There’s no sense in “ti4ree,” whereas
there’s both rhyme and reason in “tea-tree," The
early settlers found that the fresh leaves had art
aromatic smell, not unlike that of some kinds of dry
tea, and that was enough. Incidentally, the plant
Lycium barborum , one of the Solanacece, to which
order the potato and the tomato belong, was at one
time largely grown in England and called the “tea-
plant, on account of some venturesome spirits using
an infusion of its leaves as a substitute for mother’s
tipple.
OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN.
B ILLBO: “I like change it my name, Boss.”
BOSS: “Orright, Bilbo! What name you
like it — Jimmy, Charlie, Henry?”
BILBO: “Oh, I think Henry berry good.”
BOSS: “Right now, Henry— you go down
clean ’ ini out hut fust time. Then you
chop ’im wood. Then you bum old
cow longa creek. Then” ——
HENRY: “ Hold on, Boss! Don’t like this
Henry name—too much plurry work.
Think I keep it Bilbo.”

"Oh, yes, he's a very successful actor."

“No, but he gets lodgings."
“Billy T.” : As an old gooseberry-bushman
I have been perplexed by recent references to the
padymelon in the “Aboriginalities” column. I gather
that there is a widespread erroneous impression that
the padymelon is a myth, chimera or delusion like the
bunyip, the cockatrice and the hippogriff. Having
grown padymelon both from the seed and the slip, I
can vouch for it that this much-maligned vegetable
is sober and steady in its habits, closely allied to the
cucumber, and possessing all that household favorite’s
amiability, steadfastness of purpose and love of order
and good government. Superficial investigators have
no reason that I can discover for the ridiculous assump-
tion that the padymelon has a tail which it uses in
flight, beyond the fact that in full-grown specimens
the stem or stalk is sometimes found to attain a
length of 15 or IS inches. In such circumstances the
stem might easily be taken for a tail by untrained
observers; but I have examined the stalk minutely in
all weathers, and it presents at all times all the
accepted features of a true stem. In the matter of
location it certainly has something in common with
the flexible posterior appendage of many animals, but
the padymelon most emphatically has not the power
to move this terminal, nor is it vertebrae in the true
sense. There is no denying, however, that on rare
occasions the padymelon does employ the tail in
swinging, but only from the parent bough. I have
observed this phenomenon myself, but after hundreds
of experiments am in a position to assert that in no
circumstances can a padymelon manipulate the tail
once it has been severed from the main trunk. In
one instance I infested a melon with 900 common or
kitchen flies, fasting, having first attached a certified
seismograph to the tail or stem. After seven hours
there was not the faintest indication of vertical, hori-
zontal, lateral or undulatory movement,
* * * #
“Lance-Jack”: It still seems to be a
matter for argument among scientists whether the
flying-fish flaps its wing-fins like a bird or uses them
like a monoplane. I watched for hours when steam-
ing across the Indian Ocean, but could never detect
any movement of the wings. The fish could be seen
in hundreds streaking through the water like blue
shadows before the bows of the ship; suddenly
clouds of them would leap above the surface and fly
for short distances. Individual fish often flew for
300 yards and more, gaining momentum for longer
flight by dropping their tails on to the surface
for a couple of seconds and wriggling them vigor-
ously.
* * * *
“E.S.S.”: The marsupial mole is a rare
beast, but is occasionally met with among the sand-
hills of Central Australia, where it burrows into
ants’ nests and laps up both ants and their succu-
lent larvae. The mole, whose small eyes have become
atrophied by long disuse in subterranean digging's,
depends wholly in its search for food on its sense of
smell. A small, stoutly-built animal, it is covered
with long silky fur, silvery-grey to chestnut brown,
and is armed with huge burrowing claws on the
front feet. The blunt nose, besides scenting out
prey, is adapted for rooting and ploughing, being
protected by a horny covering. The tail is short
and leathery and marked with rings.
“Leo Lear”: Another difficult job is to
select the 12 most beautiful Australian birds. In
parrots alone you could fill up your list and leave
all the lovely pigeons, honeyeaters, finches, etc.,
clamoring for entrance. A Bananaland dozen would bowl
us all out; but here’s the start of my lot from S.W.
Victoria: Flame-breasted robin, with his brilliant
scarlet front throat to vent; the azure kingfisher
(the leading Australian blue bird) ; ultramarine blue
and rusty orange; the red robin, just a peg or two
behind his superb cousin; the red lory or crimson
parrot, a vision of crimson with blue wings and
tail; the blue wren, the friend of all gardeners and
farmers; the white crane, now, thanks to women's
head decorations, almost as rare as a statesman in
an Australian Parliament; the spotted-sided finch, a
little chap with a red tail and white spotted side.
A second speckled bird is the spotted diamond-bird.
He also had a red tail patch, but is marked ail over

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
•>h, it's meat, meat, meat; ruddy, bloody meat;
Cat’s meat, ship’s meat, an’ meat that you can cat;
iSossiges an’ cutlets an’ tortured ’eel o’ cow,

Prime beef an’ veal joints an’ mutton by the street,
Stewin’ tripe an’ leg chops an’ frozen porker’s feet;
Under-cut or upper fer breakfast, lunch or supper
Js the chantey of the latest Vanderdecken on the beat.
There was once a famous steamer with a brace o’
buckin’ screws,
Distinguished for ’er tucker an’ ’er fire an’ lightnin’
booze;
When the blood an’ bay’net bell rang to the seat o’
war she went
To ’elp ter knock the bottom out o’ William’s argu-
ment ;
She steamed out from Orstralier fer regions far
away,
Past Neptune’s warm dominions from out o’ Table
Bay;
Not as a speedy trooper nor a transport for the
maimed,
Nor yet as merchant cruiser was this tramping rover
famed;
But with kind disposed devotion she roamed around
the ocean,
An' tip Wand’rin’ Butcher Transport unofficially was
named.
In orl ’er roomy cabins was a brace o’ butcher
blocks,
A chopper an’ an ’acksaw, an’ the usual butcher
stocks;
While ev’r.v man aboard ’er, both officers an’ crew,
Wore not the old-time garments, but aprons white
an’ blue;
The only work they practised was dumpin’ meat in
doubt,
The only sport an’ pastime a little friendly bout
With ’acksaw or with meataxe, when each would do
’is worst
Ter see who’d rip a bullock into quarter inches first;
The onlv gawd they worshipped was not the Golden
Calf,
But Rachel, dear old auntie, the butcher’s better-
half—
The red-complexioned lady of reputation shady;
Orl claimed ’er for their idol from boy to chief o’
staff.
Tlr duty was ter wander round the seven seas at
large
With swingin’ gear an’ derricks orl ready ter dis-
charge ;
An’ the ’ands ’ad long-range glasses an’ did a daily
beat
In case an ’ungry transport flew signals “Short of
meat.”
I-er years an’ years she wandered on this butcher-
trekkin’ game;
An’ year by year, unlucky, morose ’er crew became-
They slung up bullock-slashin’ an’ drowned their
woes in rum,
An almost gave up lookin’ fer the ship as wouldn’t

When suddenly one mornin’ the lookout gives a rub
To is greasy pair o’ glasses near ruddy Rachel’s tub,
As a trooper cheered their ’untin’ with a gallant
spread o’ buntin’,
Displayin’ urgent signals that she was short o’ grub.
Full-speed rang quick an’ slippy an’ the speed as she
did then
Was never even dreamt of before bv sailor men

To us, an vowed ’is vilest ’e’d ’ave no meat-’awks

“Pamphile” : “Lantana’s” 24in. adder (B.
13/9/’l7) will have to grow a bit to equal the one
killed by fisherman Charlie Shraeder at Brunswick
Heads (N.S.W.) tVo years ago. It went 30in.
“W.J.C.” : I see that borer-beetle is play-
ing up on the banana plantations at Redlands (Q.).
This pest is also causing trouble on the Tweed
(N.S.W.). Some orchardists make a practice of
driving a couple of copper nails into each tree a
few feet from the ground, and they reckon this
keeps the vegetable free of borer. Although the
banana has only a false stem composed of the bases
of the leaves, it might be worth while trying this
method on it.
» * * *
“Ida D.”: Can any qualified teetotaller
explain this? After two recent heavy rainstorms at
Goulburn (N.S.W.) thousands of thin thread-like
worms were crawling over our back yard, and up
the iron tank and near-by walls. The yard is hard,
trodden gravel, and on the vegetable beds, 10 or 12
yards away, there was not a worm to be seen. The
visitors were the color of an earth-worm, but scarcely
thicker than a pin, and I could find no earth-holes.
Did they come down in the shower, like the
governor’s frogs?
* * » •
M Eloc”: I don’t know what a camel can
do with Billjim aboard, but I can tell “Bowyang”
(B. 6/9/’l7) that a few years ago at Beltana station
(N.T.) the wife of the managing partner became ill.
Nearest doctor was 150 miles away. An Afghan
volunteered to go for him. He got back on the
second day. It was a riding steed.
NO CHANGE IN THE PROGRAMME.
“Hello, Bill! Who’re yer working for now?”
“Same little lot —wife and six kids.”
“Oyo”: At Hawk’s Nest, between Mor-
gans and Laverton (W.A.), I came across a dry-
blower’s camp which had the top half of a nigger s
skull fastened to the door. The occupant (of the
camp, I mean) ,said that the brain case was the
best thing, he knew to keep black brother at a
respectful distance. He mentioned .that at one
time the nigs raided the Niagara settlement, beyond
Menzies. A punitive expedition set out next day
due west, and the thieves came in from the east for
the second course. My friend’s was the only tent
not looted, and that was on account, he said, of
the burglar-proof device.
» * * *
“Larrikin”: I’ve had many a good feed
of tree-grubs in Tasmania! We used to chop them
out of wattle-trees and grill them on the coals. They
were a delicate flesh color, about an inch in circum-
ference and two and a half inches long, and were
like marrow in taste. Knew a couple of old
Queensland squatters who always nosed around fresh
loads of wood for grubs and ate them raw, without
trimmings!
“More Moa” : The moa survived long after
the white man reached Maoriland, according to a
circumstantial account in the Nelson Examiner of
June 12, 1861. The paper deposed that while Chief
Surveyor Brunner, his assistant Maling and a native
were surveying on the ranges between the Riwaka
“GEE UP, STRAWBERRY!”
and Takaka valleys, towards the end of May, 1861,
they spotted some enormous bird footprints, 14in.
long, and with a spread of llin. at the points of
the toes. Another morning they not only saw foot-
prints of the same kind, but were convinced that
they were absolutely fresh and made that very night,
because some of them covered footprints made by
Brunner and his party the day before. They
could not find the bird, though.
* * * *
One John Russell, in a story titled “The
Last God,” published, if you please, in Collier's
Weekly (18/8/’l7), tells this to the gaping crowd:
Peters yanked the quaking bundle aboard and
pulled again to safety from the mangrove shadow
while the fugitive stammered his story in broken
beche de mer.
* * * *
“Ashton”: Cutting-out di y at Doondi
shed (Q.). Shearing in full swing. Last run. Shed
vibrating with play of machines. Board a seething
hive of energy. Boss of the board well out of the
way. Sky full of dark, lowering clouds, rapidly
moving west. A tall, amiable-looking giant, speed-
ing-up, ripped a concertina wether with the machine,
leaving a 6in. slash. The blood soaked rapidly
through the wool and dripped on to the board. He
shore on. Last run. Na time to waste. Finished.
Hastily crushing the trembling animal between his
knees he yelled, “Tar!” pulled a safety-pin out of
his singlet and pinned up the gaping cut. A dab
of tar. A kick down the shoot —and a rush to catch
just one more sheep.
* * * *
“Pick” : The attraction of light that lures
moths and night birds to their death was made use
of by Brother Binghi to provide the gunyah with
meat. He erected a ring of high stakes and bushes
intertwined, and in the centre, at night time, kept a
fire glowing. Birds darting into the enclosure were
entangled in the bushes.
* * * *
“Leo Lear” : The Wannon district of Vic-
toria gives a good idea of how the surface of the
globe is fashioned by erosion. The locality is very
undulating, has a deep, loose, rich soil, is almost
treeless, and well grassed. Before the land was
stocked only the main streams had any mentionable
washouts, and the hillsides were well padded with
thick sward ; but when sheep started making narrow
tracks down the inclines the water drained into them
and trouble began. In no time fair-sized gutters
were washed out, which widened and deepened into
chasms 20ft. deep and twice as wide. Paddocks were
cut in two, stock being unable to cross; also, the
sides of the creeks made an excellent start for
rabbit-warrens; and once the Wannon soil begins to
break away it is as hard to hold as a 5.55 p.m.
rush for a free beer. I’ve seen the sea discolored 30
miles along the coast from the flood-waters of the
Glenelg.
“C. 1.” : In my 35 years’ experience in the
bush I have seen manna on many kinds of eucalyptus
trees, but in greatest quantities on the lipunia tree,
a species of blackbutt which grows about the
headwaters of the Paroo and other rivers and
creeks in South-west Queensland. Also I have on my
place manna on blue-gum and spotted-gum, the
scented eucalyptus. Nearly all kinds of ants seem
to use the manna; at least they carry it to their
nests in large quantities.
“The Hum” : I back the native-companion
to win the long-distance voice stakes. On the
Riverina plains, in clear weather, two miles is well
within his range. Often I’ve watched the passing
flight of these graceful birds, thousands of feet
high in the air, and their tuneful cry could be heard
long after they could no longer be seen.
“Snell”: Dick Prince lived in a stringy-
bark hut on Billygoat Hill. He was working on his
own in the pyrites in Gin Creek, and batching. His
chimney was built of slabs, with a perfunctory lining
of stones to the extent of a couple of feet up. Only
a mad insurance agent would have accepted Prince's
risk, but it did not seem to occur to Richard that
every night when he lay him
down to sleep he ran a fine
chance of being done brown
before morning. Even had
this pleasing possibility sug-
gested itself to Mr. Prince, it
is doubtful if that very per-
functory gentleman would not
have “chanced the ducks.”
“Chancing the ducks” was
the keynote of Richard’s
philosophy. In the prelimin-
ary hours of one dark, cold
morning, Colt, homing from
afternoon shift at the Left
Bower, and crawling wearily
over Billygoat Hill, discov-
ered the fire in Prince’s
wooden chimney. The flames
had a good hold of the desic-
cated slabs and were burning
merrily. With a sheet of
bark torn from the wall and
saturated in Dick's tank, Colt,
in the assumed absence of the
hut-liolder, beat out the fire,
sustaining a few burns in his
effort. Then he carried sev-
eral buckets of water up from the creek, and stopped
the parts adjacent to the recent conflagration as a
reasonable precaution. At this stage came a voice
from the interior of the hut: “I say, thanks very
much, whoever y’ are. I thought someone ’d come
along.”
* * * *
"Billy Blue” : When Bulloeky Bill arrived
at the station with a load it was found that a case of
brandy had been tampered with and the boss made a
song about it. William was indignant, not at being
thought a thief, but at being suspected of so
very unworkmanlike a job. lie took the dead marine
in one hand, slapped it with the other, and said,
“D’ye see that ’ere bottle? ’Taiij’t got no cork in
it and ’tain’t no ways broken neither. Now when I
shakes one and empties it I knocks a little hole in
the shoulder of the bottle; one of your new-chum
(adjective) shepherds done that business” (and here
he spat in unmitigated disgust) “and I wonder a
gent like you couldn’t see as much yerself.” The
boss apologised.
“D.F.” : Many farmers are ready to shoot
the swamp-hawk on sight because it is supposed
to eat a chicken now and again; but the Oatlands
(Tas.) Municipal Council reckons that the good the
bird does far outweighs any little harm it may do,
and has put up a petition to have it protected. As
a matter of fact the swamp hawk lives mainly on
mice and other vermin, with a rabbit for Sundays
and Christmas Day.-
NO TIME FOR A SPELL.
“ Hey , Toby — coo-eel ”
“Can't stop! Must get along station afore this plurry horse knocks up!”
“GRAND!"
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“And how is Dad?” we asked the lad
Who helped to till the land.
His clothes were new, his words were few ;
He grinned and said: “He's grand!”
“And Mum, you say, is still 0.K.?”
His heated face he fanned.
Quite ill at ease, he clutched his knees-
And shyly said: “She’s grand!”
“And how are Joe, and Kate and Flo?”
Each friendly face he scanned,
And scratched his head, and coughed and said:
“Oh, that mob! They are grand!’’
“Your Uncle Ted? Somebody said
He’d given up the band
Because his sight gives out at night ?”
“That’s dinkum. But he’s grand!”
“Poor Billjim’s jaw’s smashed, so I saw.
When, bully-beef’s at hand,
What can he do now he can’t chew?”
“He sucks it! Old Bill’s grand!”
No grandeur cloaks the simple folks
Who toil ’mid sun and sand ;
But in a way it’s right to say
That all of them are grand.

Miss Nina Speight, the charming young Australian who is now
appearing in the “movies” with the Rolin Film Co., America, wrote
the following letter before leaving for the land of “Stars and
Stripes”:—
Pacific Mansions, Darlinghurst,
March 1, 1916.
Mr. G. W. HEAN, Chemist.

Business, Bobbery, etc
“Curley Lismore” : For years the dreaded
Queensland cattle tick and its ally redwater
have been creeping over the northern border
of N. S. Wales, despite the efforts of Gov-
ernment and the expenditure of much money.
Now the departmental officers have confined
the pest practically to the Tweed quarantine
area, although in isolated cases ticks are
found as far south as Woodburn. In order
to deal a crushing blow to the scourge the
Department decided to enforce compulsory
dipping within the Tweed area, and
promptly the vicinity was full of indig-
nation and uproar. What a selfish
attitude ! The Tweed is the front door by
which ticks can enter, and naturally it is
the right place to start dealing with them.
A cry has gone up for Federal control, but
this would not make the position any easier.
Dipping is the only way to eradicate the
trouble, and whether it is done under State
or Federal authority it has to be done, and
properly, too.
Mrs. Childs, of Gerangamete (Vic.),
who died in March last year, bequeathed £5O
to the Rev. Nolan, R.C. priest of Colac, on
condition that he said masses for the
repose of the souls of her late hus-
band and herself. The padre died before the
old lady, whereupon the widow’s executors
asked the State Full Court how they stood
regarding the £5O. Justice Hood opined
that the cash must return to the widow’s
estate. It was claimed on appeal to the
High Court that the bequest was a “chari-
table” one, and consequently should stand.
Giving judgment Justice Barton (Isaacs and
Powers concurring) remarked that the Court
was bound by the principle of law that a use
wasn’t charitable where the observance of
it could lead to no public advantage and
could benefit only the donor or the donor and
his family ; but “as he found incontrovertible
evidence in the present case that the observ-
ance or use of the trust was primarily for
the benefit of the whole of those who were
within the faith of the donor, he concluded
that elements were present wdiich consti-
tuted the bequest a charitable gift.” Ap-
peal accordingly upheld—'which will make
the earnest R.C. feel good, while the Yellow
Pup sees Popes in its dreams.
The halfpenny has suddenly become a
common trifle in Adelaide, too; and as in
Sydney the trams are responsible. The
Municipal Tramways Trust there has been
losing money and decided to put the
fares up, instead of letting the loss be made
good out of the rates of the component corpo-
rations and district councils. So the penny
fare has been abolished. One section now
costs lAd., two cost 2jd., and the regular
traveller, the three-section passenger, has to
pay 3d. cash, instead of buying tickets at
half-a-erown a dozen. Adelaide is thus hit
rather harder than Sydney, where one sec-
tion now costs lid., two 2d., and three the
same old 3d.

“Fax”: A Melbourne business man tells a
yarn of how he happened into a discussion
with a small party of disconsolate workers
on strike. He rather worried them by ask-
ing w r hy the union didn’t have a secret
ballot. The men had no answer, but told
him to wait and he’d get a full and satisfac-
tory explanation from Bouncer, the secre-
tary, who would be along directly. Bouncer
arrived as predicted, and was told to give
the crushing reply. But Bouncer merely
rhodomontaded like a Yarra-banker. At last,
cornered, he admitted that “the boys” were
not permitted secret ballots because they
couldn’t be trusted with them. “These
chaps,” he said, “are too weak-kneed. Most
of ’em would vote against a strike.” Then
the critic remarking that the boys were
losine 1 wages whilst union officials were
dra wing salaries as usual, said to the stormy
orade g ‘‘You^ %l yo? £5 a week, I sup-
nose’” The secretary protested that what
1 p Lit wasn’t anybody’s business but his
own” “He gets £7 a week, Mister, - ’ said one
f the melancholy “boys.” Then they all
carted to upbra d their eloquent paid ser-
vant for ca ling them “weak-kneed,” and
w Ist this new disturbance was raging the
business man escaped. He went home to
hrood on the admitted fact that democratic
unionism objects to secret ballots because it
fe“S that a majority of its members don’t
know when a little "starvation is good for
,
era * *
“C.V.J.” : “Wonga” (B. 20/9/T7) says
that the apple business depends upon the
export trade. Bosh! Give Australians good
fruit at reasonable prices and they’ll con-
sume all the apples this country can pro-
dtice. The experience of S. Aus. is decisive
proof of this. The 1910 apple crop of
832,872 bushels was a record for the State,
yet only 119,510 bushels were over-
seas. The figures for 1914 were 450,240
bushels grown. 113,623 bushels exported.
When it was known that the 1916 crop
would be such a record one, the Govern-
ment was urged to assist the growers to get
rid of their fruit. A scheme was at once
initiated whereby the fruitgrowers delivered
apples to a central depot. The Government
charged only out-of-pocket expenses. Yet
onlv 5000 cases were distributed in this
way because the growers found that they
had’their hands full in supplying their usual
customers owing to the extraordinary de-
mand created when the public found that
the best apples could be secured at 4s. a 401 b.
case, or lid. for the single pound, delivered,
And 4s. a case to the consumer meant 3s, 6d.
a case to the grower, the retailer getting the
odd Od Bight in the full flush of the
season the price of the best fruit never fell
below 3s. 6d.—a profitable figure for all
concerned. Enormous quantities of apples
were put into cold storage, and realised on
an average 7s. to Bs. bushel nett to the
grower, and so sustained was the demand
throughout the year that S.A. imported
American apples during October and Novem-
her. In spite of the microscopic quantity
exported, S.A. growers will tell you that the
1916 season was the most profitable they
ever had All that is required is an economi-
cal method of distribution. In S.A., where
for the supply of the metropolitan area the
middleman is cut right out, we have it.

“F.N.T.” : Maoriland flax grows well in
Victoria, but so far nothing practical has
been done to establish the industry. It
needs capital, and the \ ic. farmer mostly
doesn’t know how to co-operate with his
neighbors in the purchase of machinery for
treating the crops. Thomas Edsall, a Maori-
land farmer now settled at Benmson a vil-
lage on the rich Gippsland flats through
which the Franklin flows, has started some-
thing,” however. He has persuaded a gather-
ing of local farmers that there is a potential
gold-mine in the plant, having proved its
hardinesss, productivity and freedom from
b ight and pests, and shown that co-opera-
turn is the only self-respecting course for
the farmer to follow The Government has
been approached but in this case merely for
information. If Edsall can only whip U p
enough enthusiasm. South Gippsland should
presently be providing a worthy object-
lesson to the rest of the State—and making
money.

The. sea is giving up some of its dead ships
j n these days of enormous prices. Four or
tive years ago the Norwegian windjammer
Farsund went ashore on the eastern end of
Cape Barren Island and seemed likely to
s t a y there for good. But now a mainland
syndicate has set about resurrecting her.
There are always big risks about these sal-
V age jobs; but the prizes now make them
W orth taking. There’s more than one man in
Australia sitting down in comfort on the
proceeds of a single good salving job.

“11.0. : Los Angeles, where the moving-
picture films come from, is a place where
things are always happening. Motor-cars
chase one another through the streets,
“cops” pursue “crooks,” fire-engines dash
about, and other forms of excitement occur
daily for pictorial purposes. An Australian
visiting the place was amazed to see a
gang of masked men hold up a bank in broad
daylight, while shrewd citizens looked
around and took no further notice. The
Australian saw the inevitable moving picture
man grinding away at his machine in the
roadway, and then he realised how he had
nearly fallen in. That is just what the gang
had calculated upon—that no notice would
be taken so long as they fixed up a picture-
machine in the offing!

O.K. : Lately there was a further deyel-
opment in connection with the return of the
long-lost mineral waters at Hepburn Springs,
in the Daylesford (Vic.) district. At the
ornate Spring House, where the taps ran
dry for a year or two the water came back
at first in a very diluted form, becoming
more gaseous and ironised as time went on,
untU length it got the tang of the old
Hepburn spring which gave the place its
reputation. But something was still amiss
w |tb the adjacent c-reek. Fresh outbreaks
gasS y wa ter promised to re-establish nor-
mai conditions, but none of them continued,
few weeks ago, however, one spring in the
creek that had been mourned as lost bubbled
up aga j n vigorously as ever, and as all the
mineral-water supplies seem to have taken
to their original courses, Hepburn feels like
the Scriptural widow whose bit of live
mutton came back to the fold.
HOUSE TO LET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Tucked well aloft amid the stars
And rich in corners shady,
That well may glad devout intent,
And here and there a laughing room
With wines and flowers and books abloom,
And here and there a sign-post high
That shines in gold against the sky
To point the path where Psyche went,
I have a little tenement
That’s waiting for a lady.
{Apply, with references meet
And all particulars complete.
Dan Cupid, in Felicity-street.)
The furnishings are up to date,
To comfort most inviting;
The view is rare and delicate,
There is a garden richly set
With many a twinkling statuette,
And marble naiads ’neath the trees
Inspire appropriate ecstasies.
(The tenant should not be sedate
At evening after half-past eight.)
I recommend the lighting.
{Apply Dan Cupid, agent for
Original proprietor.
Felicity-street. You'll see the door.)
The pictures, which go with the place,
Are an attractive feature
That sure will spur the constant mind
To ceaseless effort to excel.
In every room there is a bell;
So if you want the silvery moon,
Just ring, and you shall have it soon.
Or should you wish to draw the blind
The housemaid is extremely kind,
A most deserving creature.
{Felicity-street is on the right
As you turn out of Candlelight,
Dan Cupid, agent for Delight.)
Before applying, kindly note
That dawn is always rosy
In this enticing tenement,
And every dusk is honeyed by
A pleading music warm and shy
That former tenants have preferred
To any crooning note of bird.
Ten kisses daily is the rent,
And each convenience is meant
To keep the outlook cosy.
{lf you are dull or lacking pep.,
Apply to me, the owner’s rep.,
Dan Cupid. Kindly mind the step.)

What is Talcum Powder?
TALCUM is an inorganic
substance —neither damp-
ness, heat or perspiration
affect it. Rice, starch, and
other vegetable powders are
organic —they are affected
by temperature and mois-
ture —perspiration sours
them —when sour they be-
come a source of irritation
and a breeding place for
infectious germs.
M

Borated Talcum Powder
will not sour or ferment; and, medicated in the proper
proportion, covers baby’s skin with a protective coating
against threatening germs.
You use Talcum Powder in such unlimited quantities on
the sensitive skin of your baby, that the selection of a pure,
safe powder is of great importance.

Science has proved that erosion of the
teeth is greatly accelerated by the use
of gritty pastes and powders to pro-
duce a brilliant whiteness.
The Oxygen Tooth Powder
achieves this desirable object without
any such harmful effects. On the
contrary, it actively destroys all decay
germs, even in those hidden recesses
beyond the reach of a toothbrush, and
at the same time it strengthens the
gums and refreshes the whole mouth.

POLITICAL
POINTS
THE LESSER RISK.
SENTRY: “Halt, or I fire!”
DESPATCH RIDER: “Dammit, man, I can't
stop! Take your blithering bayonet
away from the blanky tyre and shoot!”
After all there is to be no public
inquiry into the charges made by David
\\ atson, then a N. S. M ales senator,
against M. M. Hughes in the Senate last
* larch charges which led to the sudden
abandonment of the proposal to extend the
1 e. of Parliament, and the equally-sudden
decision to dissolve both Houses and hold a
general election. Hughes has paid £2oo
costs, while Matson Jias made . a state-
ment that he did not intend to impute, to
the 1 rime Minister any intention to bribe
or corrupt him.” This is all very well, but
where does the public.come in? Whatever
Watson intended to impute, there is no
doubt that definite charges were made against
Huirhes. The Labor party made insistent
demands for a Royal Commission, and at
ane stage Hughes said: “If they want a
Royal Commission, in God’s name let them
have it.” Later he said that he had
decided to take other action, which would
give a full public inquiry, and afterwards he
launched an action for slander against
YY atson. Next he made an application to
have some of the particulars of the defence
struck out. This was dismissed, with costs
(about £4O or £5O). The free and independent
will probably never know what led to the
sudden wilting of the Labor party’s majority
in the Senate, or whether there was any-
thing more than a strange coincidence in
R. K. Reaay’s dramatic resignation at a time
when J. Earle was in Melbourne. Mean-
while the Prime Minister rests under the
unpleasantness of having been accused of
attempting to make a deal and of having
paid the costs of the accuser in a law suit
which is no longer pending.
“Quan”: This is how the red-tape web is
spun in N. S. Wales Government Printing
Office, according to evidence given before the
Public Service Commission, the other day.
If a humble bloke puts in an application for
a few more bob a week,
a departmental commit-
tee of three, appointed by
the Government Printer,
considers the matter, and,
without having a word
with the applicant, makes
a recommendation and
passes it on to the Gov-
ernment Printer. He,
also, makes a recommen-
dation, and gives it a
gentle push along to a
Board consisting of him-
self, the Under-Secretary
for Finance and Trade,
and a member of the
Public Service Board,
which in turn reports to
the Public Service
Board. That body
broods over the case, and
lets the Treasurer know
the result, which i s
shoved back in due course
to the Government
Printer, who solemnly
b forms the applicant of
the decision. If it is
“No, ’ the applicant has the satisfaction of
knowing that it cost his bleeding country a
bob or two.
Crawford Vaughan made rather a neat re-
mark during a debate on the Adelaide park
lands in S.A. Assembly the other night.
Part of the park was taken long ago as a
site for a gaol. T. 11. Smeaton suggested
the removal of the prison, but wanted a con-
cession of other lands in return. That, said
Vaughan, would be a “quid pro quod.”
Ebenezer Ward, S.A., did not long sur-
vive his 80th birthday. Only last month
The Bulletin was describing his varied
career as actor, pressman and
politician. He was in one or
other of the S.A. Chambers
from 1870 to 1900, and held
office with such old-timers as
Boucaut, Way and Morgan. He
was one of Adelaide’s most
fluent and flowery orators, J.
L. Parsons and Rowland Rees
(both _ dead) being his only
rivals in that line. For years
Ward was Chairman of Com-
mittees in the Assembly. He
left a large family, scattered
over various States—three are
in the trenches. Since 1911
he had lived in Perth. '» The
one place that he could not be
kept out of was a printing
office. He was on London
Morning Post about 1850.
Arriving in Melbourne in 1859,
he swung a pen until he moved
to Adelaide, where in 1861 he
succeeded R. S. Smytlie on the Hansard
(subsidised) staff of the Advertiser. Later,
he was editor of the then Telegraph, and
founder of a Northern Argus, a Farmers’
Messenger and a City and Country —long
since dead. At 80 he was writing for the
Western Mail.
Peacock is the limit! When Governor
Stanley unloaded his unfortunate remarks
about the iniquity of criticising the admin-
istration Peacock applauded loudly. It was
only next day, when the Age took Stanley
vigorously to task, and Hagelthorn, the
Premier’s fellow Minister, promptly followed
suit, that the cackler hastened to assure the
press that when he cheered he was not fully
seized of the purport of his Ex.’s remarks.
But another glimpse of his views was ob-
tained in the Assembly last week when
Sinclair released the shutter with the query,
“‘Has the Premier seen the statement made
by Joseph Ward, M.L.’s Treasurer, that a
man who desires an election now deserves to
be hanged?” “I have not seen it,” said
Peacock, with thoughtless haste; “but it is
true.” P.S.—No explanations, by request.
Those who regarded .T. I>. Ormond,
of Maoriland (just gone west), merely
as a reserved man who talked seldom
in Parliament or out of it, and employed
himself chiefly in breeding and running race-
horses and voting against the Labor party,
were not generally aware that he took his
share in the early days in quelling the
Maori disturbances. When Te Kooti threat-
ened Hawkes Bay, Ormond was in charge
of operations against the famous marauder,
and always spoke of this period as the most
troublous time of his life. Probably it was,
for Te Kooti was not only a bloodthirsty
scamp, who had none of the fine spirit of the
average Maori fighter, but he was also as
full of tricks a« a packet of crackers.
Ropata and Kemp, who hunted him from one
refuge to another after the Mohaka massa-
cre, found this out. Almost without follow-
ers, Te Kooti plugged on, eluded every
attempt at capture, and died in peace 20
years after the pursuit had been abandoned.
HIS STRONG POINT.
PRIVATE (to irate Sergeant-Major) : “You
know, sir, if you tried a little more
coaxing I’d do much better. I can be
led but not driven .”
“Glen H.”: Winning the war, even as far
from the scene of slaughter as Australia, is
apt to be a ghoulish business. The sup-
porters of squatter Jowett, who, amidst
howls of protest and mutterings anent the
fairness of the ballot, has received the
Fusion’s nomination for the Grampians seat,
were at work canvassing for their man before
the sitting member. Carty Salmon, was dead.
The indecency of this proceeding has already
alienated support from the Windy-War can-
didate, even the pro-Fusion Age being moved
to remark: “There has probably never been
a. more degrading or callous business in the
history of Australian politics.”
“G.H.K.’s” suggestion:—
Here’s a thought which if workable will assist
the voluntary system of recruiting, and, at the
same time, the repatriation scheme. Let the Aus-
tralian Parliament or the Government empower
those in control of the repatriation machinery
to purchase any suitable class of land or business,
etc., which could be applied in finding employ-
ment for returning me*. The purchases to be
made in the following way: Any man wishing to
volunteer but who is unable to do so on account
of, say, owning or managing a business which is
hard to dispose of, shall receive payment on
valuation, provided he is prepared to invest,
say, one-half of the balance of the payment, over
and above the amount required to settle his
liabilities, in either War Loans or War Saving
Certificates. On his return he can redeem the
amount invested with interest to that date to
enable him to make another start, helped by the
repatriation general fund. If he makes the great
sacrifice the amount invested by him shall be
given to his next of kin.
“Night Cap”: J. A. Southwood’s motiou
for closing the liquor bar of S. A. Parlia-
ment stubbed its toe on a queer point of
“procedure.” A member who thought the
debate had lasted long enough moved “that
the question be now put.” He says that he
merely meant “that the House do now
divide”; but, to his surprise, and South-
wood’s, some weird rule holds that the rejec-
tion of such a motion pushes the question
right off the notice-paper. Leave was easily
obtained next day to push it on again ; but,
from the tone of the speeches, a particularly
temperate Parliament is not likely to go so
far as to deprive itself of a drink if it wants
one.
Labor-member James Matthews has for
long been known in the House of Reps, as
Interjecting Jimmy”; but in one respect
J. Lynch can beat him. His finest effort t*
date was made while Hughes was holrti«
forth on the cost of bread. Lynch snt f 8
ward and started an interjection which eame'
to an end 200 words later. It was the W
est ever heard in the Reps. 10ng '.
Lemuel Griffiths is the Vic Farmo* »
Union candidate for the Barwon sent of
present held by that heavily-crusted grazier
James E arrer. Lemuel farms at Lara who. ’
Senator Bill Plain also has a neat fin *
ranch, and where the State sends its a
holic soaks to be dried out. Lemuel’s X
front-name may serve him as a recommend?
tion to those who desire a sober-sided renre
sentative. ISo Lemuel ever started a revoln
tion. UIU "
Andrew McKissock, who took on a ioh as
A.W.U. organiser when he lost his Sena?
seat in May is to try to push produce-
salesman Robert McGregor out of Ballarat
East at the State elections.
Lieut. Jim Hurst, until lately member for
Darwin in the Speck’s Assembly, is back
from Flanders with his right hand perma-
nently out of action.
Harold Page, a Grafton (N.S.W.) native
has hustled a bit, too. First a State school-
teacher, but later in the Federal Electoral
Office, he began as a private about October
1915. He gained his first and second stars in
the officers’ school before embarkation his
captaincy and M.C. in France nine months
later, incidentally scored three “mentions”
and won his majority within 18 months of
enlistment.
“Fax”: Hear the insensate babble of the
Argus on the matter of schemes for the pre-
vention of strikes:
The sharing of profits, no matter how well it mav
work in a few prosperous establishments, would if
made compulsory, kill off struggling businesses ’and
prevent new ones being founded. Workers would
share the profits, but not the risks. What if there
were no profits ?
What, indeed? Well, the workers couldn’t
get what wasn’t there. If they were drawing
fair wages in a bad year they’d be doing
better than the boss, and better than miners
working a worn-out mine on the tribute sys-
tem. The Argus must trust to stronger
arguments against profit-sharing, as a sys-
tem, than the truism that profits have got to
be earned ere they are shared. And it
should avoid the fiction that a worker’s life
is all wages, and no risks, belongs to the
class of stuff that shrinks to nothing in the
wash. . Take the case of a small industry
employing 50 hands. It flourishes awhile
and enriches the man who runs the show,
but when it profits him no more he shuts
down and retires on his vested interests,
leaving the blokes who haven't acquired any
v.i. to hustle for a new job. The big man’s
little loss may prove the little man’s utter
ruin. The dwarf shares a risk with the
giant for just as long as the man of finan-
cial brawn chooses to keep his end up.
There never was a business wherein the
employees didn’t share a risk with the em-
ployer, nor are the shares equal. If the
Huns captured Australia next week and the
Argus were suppressed for speaking dis-
respectfully of the Kaiser, the employees
would at once perceive where the thick end
of the risk had been situated. Meanwhile
they don’t enjoy the worry of sharing profits.
WHAT DID HE MEAN?
“I don't see why any woman should object to
sitting in ‘the altogether!"
“You're right! It simply gives those girls
who have a real opportunity to shine
over those who haven't."

have gone on strike. They threaten to prevent an
early convocation of the constituent assembly by
bringing about a shortage of paper for electoral
bulletins.” —Russian revolutionary item.
The revolution staggered in its round.
East, north and south the ragged factions swayed.
Strange parties to strange propaganda bound
The new-born hope of Russia scratched and flayed;
And, heedless of the Prussians’ dread advance,
Village and province joined the fatal dance.
The Romanoff was gone, the people ruled—
At least, they tried to rule by twos and threes.
The German, dreaming they might still be fooled,
Waved poisoned olive branches on the breeze;
And fiery Kerenski strove with might
To keep the democratic spirit bright.
But things went wrong. In fact, they went so wrong
It seemed all purposes must end in none,
And Russia, ere the winter came along,
Be but the ice-cooled larder of the Hun—
A place to merely yield supplies of food
For Teuton armies in their murderhood.
One chance remained. A convocation vast
Of every interest and class and claim
Might talk itself to commonsense at last
And gild and guide the revolution’s flame
Till, with one splendid and united glow,
It flashed contempt upon the whole world’s foe.
Then rose the paper-makers, loud and vain.
And called a strike to block the nation’s way.
They did not stop to reason or explain,
But merely yelled, “The wheels must rest to-day.
Out on your parties and the ballot-box!
We hold the key to turn in all the locks.”
No paper! And democracy goes flat.
A king may rule in spoken language trite,
While awestruck courtiers grovel on the mat,
But freedom needs the wherewithal to write
The many-fisted mandate of its thought.
Stop off the paper and its word is nought.
Oh, Bill and Nicky, how you missed the ’bus!
Steel and explosives you could understand.
You built the war-machines with noise and fuss,
Yet missed the secret of the high command ;
For in democracy’s most stormy weather
Votes and the paper-mill must work together.

confined situation in the basement of a printing works. The >vhole work, conducted under
the most difficult of situations, was finished in two days. Without OXY-ACETYLENE
the work would have taken weeks, and the whole of the printing machinery and plant would
have been idle and disorganised for weeks in excavation and dismantling work.

First day of the Caulfield Spring meeting
threw no glaring light on future events, save in so
far as the excellence of Lanius was confirmed by his
masterly way of winning Caulfield Stakes. The big
English nag appeared to Win when he liked and
how he liked, and though there are still three weeks
to go before the Melbourne Cup, and 9st. 31b. would
be a heavy burden in wet weather, it already looks
good enough to take 4 to 1 about Lanius for the
two-mile handicap of the year.
The result of the Debutant Stakes indicates that
there are some pretty good juveniles in the market
this Spring, and that the best of them, thus far, are
the more precocious ones from Sydney. The local
favorites, King’s Treasure, King of the Sea and
Fitness, repeated their “form” of the previous
Saturday, but the visiting Liquid Fire and Aries
proved a trifle too good for them. Also, there re-
mains the fact that Sweet Lady, who easily beat
Aries at Randwick, ran nowhere in the Debutant,
and may be confidently expected to reassert herself
presently. All the youngsters named have very good
looks as well as good performances to recommend
them. Among the failures Tragic Star is conspicu-
ously handsome.
* * ♦ *
From The Bulletin man who watches
’em in Melbourne:—•
* Pah King ran well in the Stakes that Lanius won
so easily. Nor did Sir Amyas, the natty imported
horse, lose any more friends. In fact, it may be
said of this possible “good thing” that he has run
no worse up to now than Shepherd King performed
last year ere winning the Caulfield Cup. He doesn’t
look “another Shepherd King,” but he looks at least
as good as some that have captured the Cup with a
moderate horse’s weight. It will be left to jockey
Lewis to give the straight tip as regards the rival
claims of Sir Amyas and Rael Locin. Roberto has
been riding both of them lately, and will choose one
or other for his Cup mount. His choice should be a
strong argument in favor of the chosen one. Rael
Locin is clearly an improved horse. He seemed
unlucky to lose the Toorak Handicap. King’s
Bounty, who won, and Wedge and Red Signal, who
finished third and fourth, were always a long way
ahead of Rael Locin until he pushed through the
crowd and came with a late run. Assuming that he
has gained stamina since he actually won the Toorak
from Blague last year this consistent battler must
be one of the most promising place investments for
the Caulfield Cup. Fully 15 can be made out to
have a fair winning chance; wherefore the books
have never had a more open Caulfield to bet on.
There is much to be said against all the fancied ones
that have proved the solidity of their claims.
Chrome is not an easy gelding for a 6st. 71b. boy
to handle. Wallace Isinglass rarely runs kindly in
a big field. Lingle has always seemed to lack
brilliancy, yet it must be remembered that he ran
a good third to Cagou in the Metropolitan, and it
was the third horse (Aurifer) in Cagou’s previous
Metropolitan that subsequently won the Caulfield
Cup. King’s Bounty, being by Bobadil, should last
out the distance, but he has nothing the best of it
with Rael Locin on their running last Saturday.
Bronzetti was a very pleasing runner-up to Thrice in
the Caulfield Guineas —but hitherto he hasn’t been
the sort of colt that one would confidently expect to
get away in the first flight in a Caulfield Cup, with
a light boy on his back. Every reasonable selection
raises its own reasonable objection. Something has
got to win, however. The writer prefers Chrome to
Bronzetti, Lingle or Rael Locin, and reckons that
nothing is worth backing at less than 7 to 1.
“0.K.”: Two warm favorites —Lanius and
Thrice—won the w.f.a. races at Caulfield, yet the
little Saturday punters complained that they had
backed losers in those events. Even-money Lanius
and 6-to-4 Thrice was “no good to them,” so they
went for something else at a comparatively long price
and dropped their money as usual. There’s wisdom
in the small punter’s objection to backing the very
short-priced favorite for a w.f.a. race. His backing
of something else, for the odd’s sake, is the merest
foolishness. He is practically risking his mefney on
a double. He bets that the warm favorite will get
beaten, which usually doesn’t happen, and then he
tries to pick the one that will cause the “boil
over,” and is pretty sure to have picked the wrong
one if the unexpected “boil-over” comes to pass.
When will the little punter acquire the habit of
backing nothing at all if he doesn’t have a dash on
the hot favorite? Can he not endure the agony of
watching a horserace without having a flutter on it?

What with the strike and the rain some
of the racing clubs round Sydney have had to post-
pone several meetings. As these had not been held
when the restrictions on racing were announced it
is now calmly alleged that the proprietary clubs
have a right in the lapsed proceedings. Where-
fore action is being taken to get a regulation
passed under the War Precautions Act or something
restoring these lost days to the calendar. The effort
is impudent enough to score anyhow.
* * * *
G. S. Yuille, a Sydney shipping serang,
who died last week, took to racing after war started,
importing several horses from England and acquiring
some locally, including the 1600 guineas colt Gal-
lipoli. He had rather poor success. His best win
was when the imported Rushford won Tattersall’s
Cup at Randwick.
* * * *
From a field of 17 starters in a welter
mile at Randwick on Saturday the three nags that
sorted themselves out were sired by the same horse
—Charlemagne 11. These were Franco, Ballam and
Roman Queen. The odds against this sort of thing
happening must be as long as a war.
■» * * *
The difference between Biplane in the
Chelmsford Stakes and the same colt thereafter may
be a warning to jockeys and trainers. If in the first
case Deeley was instructed that his mount had
become as tractable as a locomotive, and could be
kept behind the field and ultimately taken to the
front just as the driver chose, the race was
lost through the absurdity of trying to slow
down an unreasonable colt determined to do
his darndest from the outset, instead of trying
to humor the animal. That was how an inferior
old stager like Tarcoola once won a Melbourne Cup
from Carnage, the Y.R.C. Derby hero. Carnage
wanted to run away with the race, as Newhaven
was allowed to do three years later. There was
nothing to beat: the pace was comparatively slow,
and Carnage, if given his head, could have done
the trick easily. But jockey Moran had instruc-
tions to restrain his fiery mount, and for more than
a mile he kept the colt’s mouth open in vain striv-
ing to hold him back. Then Carnage, somewhat
winded, was allowed to shut his mouth and stay
in front. Right to the bitter end he outlasted
everything but Tarcoola, who won by half a length
from the sweating pacemaker. Never was a race
more palpably lost through the jockey trying to
obey rigid instructions without regard to the temper
of the animal he was arguing with.
“Pungawerewere” : Did you know that
Dick Seddon, big man of Maoriland for so many
years, once ran a racehorse ? At the time he was
only a member of a road board, or county council,
or something like that, in the wilderness of the
West Coast, and hadn’t started to plaster his name
on the hoardings of the earth. His chief ambition
was to win the Volunteer Cup at Hokitika. Accord-
ingly he nominated a mare he owned called Red
Rose; but it was necessary, in the conditions of
the race, that the rider should hold a commission in
a volunteer force, and Seddon had to scurry round
to find someone for the mount. He hit upon J. H.
Hankins, for many years afterwards a leading soli-
citor in Palmerston North. Hankins, whp knew a
good deal about horses as well as law, piloted Red
Rose to victory.
The great advantage of running the tote
and Ike together was proved beyond argument
at the Australian Trotting Club’s meeting in Sydney
last week ; it also shows what happens to the tote.
At the end of the proceedings the over-worked
cashiers at the implement discovered that £22 had
been handled all day long. The largest sum invested
on one race was exactly £9 10s. ; the smallest turn-
over £1 10s. Result: Revenue to the State, £1
13s. ; to the club for maintenance of tote, encourag-
ing sport, providing stake money and otherwise pro-
moting public joy, 11s. Brother MacShortodds will
now address the congregation.

“Fax” : One of the Income Tax questions
that calls for prompt reply is, how about prizes in
Tatt.’s sweeps ? There’s an uncomfortable feeling
abroad that the Federal Government would have no
compunction about mopping up most of a Tatt.’s
prize under the heading of “iniquitous war profit,”
or words to that effect. Punters would like to
know how they stand as regards their remote chance
of getting an unexpected bequest from their sinful
old uncle in Tasmania. They know what a chance
in Uncle’s lottery is worth under normal conditions.
It costs more than ss. and is worth 4s. 6d., if the
winners of big prizes are not subject to special taxa-
tion. But, if the bulk of every big prize is to be
annexed by the Federal Treasurer, an investment in
Tatt.’s has lost more than half its pre-war value.
What is a first prize really worth to the winner
nowadays ?
* * * *
“Ranger”: Where do the best riders come
from? 1 claim the belt on behalf of the men of the
Upper Goulburn Ranges (Vic.), on the Big River
and among the gorges of Mt. Torbreck. Their prads
like themselves, are unquenchable idiots whose sense
of proportion has been ruined by the size of the hills
they have to tackle. No sane man would ride one of
them. I challenge any doubter to go up there and
witness the proceedings at mustering time. If he
fails to find the full company assembled it is
because the absentees have hung out a new sign in
Palestine or France, while the old ’uns keep the
home fires burning. Ten years ago one of this old
brigade left Kanumbra, rode through Mansfield and
over the Australian Alps to Lindenow, Gippsland, mus-
tered a dozen unbroken colts, and drove them back
single-handed over the same track. A couple of
them went sore-footed on the climbing, and the
bloke in charge struck an old forge at a deserted
mining camp, roped, threw and shod his charges and
finished the trip without turning a hair. My
friend S used to ride a few roughies up Alexandra
way, but at last he struck a mare named Spider, and
she got the better- of a couple of discussions which
they had. He took her over to B to see what he
could do. B clambered aboard, and, despite
Spider’s strenuous efforts, was sitting her, as my
friend expressed it, “lovely” when the gear gave
way and the mare escaped. S——— rushed up to his
fallen comrade, found him unhurt, still in the saddle.
Nor had his feet even shifted from the stirrups.
Now what can a horse do with men like that?
* * * *
Any objection to Eileen Fitzsimmons
being entered for the lady-rider’s championship ?
At the Melbourne Show she took second prize with
Tally-ho in the Open Hunters’ Plate. None of the
sex who used to ride sideways have ridden in this
event before. In the Ladies’ High Jump five nags
were ridden by Eileen. Among them were Peter and
Musician, who after she had conducted them over
6ft. 9in. divided first and second prize money. All
this looks like several records rolled into one. The
best previous record was 6ft. 6in. by Mrs. Stace
on Emu Plains and Miss Myra Smith on Bandolier
at Sydney. Both horses were beaten at Melbourne.

As Fred Kay labored under a suspicion
that he could recover his scalp from Tommy Uren
he was given a chance to recover the missing article
at Sydney Stadium on Saturday. But the long, sad-
looking Westralian seems to have lost the art of
tying himself up in . a knot, so that none of him
was available. So it happened that the only thing
he took from Uren was a fairly hurtful pasting. As
Kay neglected many opportunities to counter-attack
and the winner performed with none of the artistry
of a champion, the affray was only moderately excit-
ing. Meantime Tommy is having a very astonishing
run.
# * * •
The weighty punch served out by Sid God-
frey was more frequent, than Jack Jannese could
scientifically evade at Melbourne on Saturday. He
endured it for a long time, but peace descended with
a final wallop in the sixteenth session. John seems
to be getting it fairly hard nowadays.
“Myuna”: What class in the masculine
. community possesses the softest cheek ? Go on
guessing until you arrive at the most unlikely, and
you get it. The pug wins the competition. Mv ton-
sorial artist tells me that the up-to-date bruiser usu-
ally possesses a skin as soft as a woman. He has
shaved both the old and the new type of jaw-belter,
and he says that to scrape the former reminded him
of taking the rust off a cast-iron plate, but massage
gives the modern gladiator a skin that is as plastic
as a chorus-girl under 50. (There are some under
50.)

One of Vic.’s best-known oarsman stepped
off at the last landing-stage when Major 11. S.
Dickinson was killed in action last month.
Dickinson learned how to handle an oar from Charlie
Donald at Wesley College, and on leaving school
joined the Albert Park Club and had many suc-
cesses. In ’ll-’I2 he rowed at No. 4 in the Vic.
eight at Perth, and next year was one of the crew
that annexed the Challenge Cup at Henley. Later
he. stroked the champion fours. Dickinson left as a
private With the Originals and gained his first star
at Gallipoli for the gallant rescue under fire of an
officer.

A. 11. Scott. D. 5.0., killed in action on
the Western Front, held at one time the N. S. Wales
high-jump record and divided honors with Kelly, of
Melb., for the Australasian record. Seett com-
manded a company at the Landing, and the extreme
point reached by Billjim on the 15th was named
after him —Scott’s Point. The Hun bowled over a
fine Australian when he went down. For
manv rears lie revelled at high-jumping with
East Sydney A.A.C., and among many fine
performances of his was the N.S.W. record
leap of 6ft. perpetrated at Sydney in 1911.
There was some great jumping when Silas Bevan
(of Gundaroo), Tom Maher, Jock Smith and. Scott
sprang after the N.S.W. championship in 1913.
Maher and Smith dropped out at sft. 7in. Scott
and Bevan raised the bar by inches until Scott failed
at sft. lliin. Two other Scotts are at the Front —-
W.J.R. (amateur boxer) and Lee (who played with
Gordon in Sydney premiership cricket).
* * * *
B. J. Folkard, in smacking up 175 for
Balmain against Syd-
ney (last season’s,
topnotcher) on Satur-
day, chipped a high
niche in Sydney’s
premiership cricket.
Also the score kept
the club together
until Sydney’s tally
of 306 had been
wiped out by 26
runs. Folkard might
have been a great
player years ago with
a little shake-up. He
represented N.S.W.
in the 1913-14 Shef-
field Shield matches,
and against South
Africa. But the
fireworks he turned
on in grade matches
never came to the
surface. Folkard was
in his best form in
1900-1 when he
headed “most wick-
ets” with 58, aver-
aging 13.29 ; last
season he took 62
sticks, averaging
12.74. He certainly
seems to have kept
his punch with the
bat as he grows
older.
FOLKARD,
of Balmain.
W. W. Hunt, N. S. Wales, is rapidly piling
lip trinkets. In the eight-hour 120yds. handicap, he
won a heat off 11yds. in 12 l-10sec., and finished
second in the final in 121 see. Watch-holders, by the
way, alleged that Hunt threw the dust behind as
rapidly as the professional champion A. B. Postle.
This is hard to swallow. With Redfern Club a
week ago Hunt was second from scratch in both
100yds. and 220yds. On Saturday he won the
100yds. handicap in 10 l-10sec. and was second in
BSoyds. In the 1916 Dunn Challenge Shield cham-
pionships Hunt finished second to the great sprinter
G. Hansel (killed at the Front not long since) at
both 100yds. and 220yds.
A swimming performance worth taking
notice of was perpetrated recently by a 14-year-old
girl—Maud Harford —who covered five miles 60yds.
of the Thames (England) in one hour 16min. Maud
is a pupil of Walter Brickett, the British Olympic
sports coach. She used the crawl stroke all the way
and never once faltered on the journey. When
Annette Kellerman did her 10-mile swim in the
Yarra in 1906 she passed five miles 300yds. in one
hour 33min. Her time for the full distance was
4 hours 52min. As she did 131 miles in a few
minutes short of four hours in the Thames a few
months later it seems as if the swimmers in that
river get a push from a strong current.
E. G. Baker, the American motor-bikist
who showed exceptional haste in Australia a while
ago, is now trying to prove that he was loitering in
this part of the world. Recently he took a spell
after capturing the record for 24 hours in the U.S.,
but when another rider named Parkhurst made him
look like a crab, he got hasty once more and started
hitting up the miles in a real harry. After 24 hours
of almost continuous motion Baker had consumed
1534£ miles, which is 81J miles better than Park-
hurst’s previous best. Baker’s average speed for the
journey was 63J miles an hour. He did 821 miles
in 12 hours. His time for 500 miles was 6hrs.
59min. 15sec., and 1000 miles went astern in 16hrs.
14min. 15sec. Parkhurst was last heard from tuning
up for an effort to overwhelm all this. Apparently
the pair will go on walloping each other until one
of them discovers the undertaker riding on the back
wheel.

The Roo car, which lately ran from Syd-
ney to Melbourne and back, is a two-seater imple-
ment built entirely in Australia and the first of
what is expected to be a numerous family. The
men behind the design and construction are Rupert
Jeffkins and Bell Foulis. Jeffkins was at one time
assistant superintendent for a big American car-build-
ing co. and claims that he built the first Velie car
to race on a registered speedwav, this being in the
qualifying trials at Indianapolis'in 1911. Up to the
following year Jeffkins was a “speed-king” and
the first man to travel over 100 miles an hour
This he did for six hours and 20 minutes at Indian-
apolis and survived the deed in spite of being an
Australian, born at Maitland. Bell Foulis is a
Scottish-Australian engineer with a ton of experience
There is a temporary Roo factory at the Glebe and
a bigger one m the making at Bunvood, and

“YT.P.A.” : The Australian youngster takes
a lot of beating in the matter of length. SamDl ■
are to be seen at all public-school gatherings wher S
the saplings invariably excel in' all branches n f
athletics. Until 1 saw the tall freaks in Java I
thought our youngsters stood alone. But the Ja
boys, particularly of mixed Dutch and native blood 3
often stretch to giant length. Bovs in knicker.-’
socks held to their long legs by suspenders, heads
surmounted by a sort of naval-officer’s cap,’ tower
above well-set-up men of 6ft. But they look’as if a
good jab in the mid-riff would crumple ’em up like
paper. I saw Soccer football teams from all parts of
Java, and the players were mostly of mixed blood
and solid, hefty chaps. The Sourabaya team, which
won the championship cup, played a fast,’ clever
game, quite up to British second-grade' Soccer. The
matches were played during the heat of the after
noon —a time when even an energetic Australian
turns in and rests, unless, on rising from tiffin, he
grabs his helmet and dashes out on business. ’ i n
which case he usually finds the other chap is doing
a nap.

The Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club cele-
brated its jubilee on October 15. It was originally
known as the Mosquito Yacht Club and was formed
at a meeting held at McGrath’s (afterwards Ji m
Punch's) Hotel, King and Pitt streets. On the
arrival of the Duke of Edinburgh, the Club changed
its name. It had 11 members at the start. Now
it numbers 245. The first commodore was T
Strickland, and amongst his successors were R. H
Harnett, W. 11. Deloitte, “Jack” Want, Dr. Miiford
and Sam Hordern.
“Dead Fish”: If the stinking-fish party
could only get there they’d be right at home in the
Cooper’s Creek country now. In the Diamantina,
Cooper’s Creek, Bulloo, Wilson’s Creek and other
streams the fish have died in such numbers that
according to messages received from the managers
of Kidman’s stations out there the water isn’t even
fit for stock. Samples of the liquid have been analysed
and showed no traces of poison. Commonwealth
Meteorologist Hunt suggests that a cold wave may
have killed the fish. He points out that there was
an abnormally cold spell in S.W. Queensland in the
second half of June. This water trouble was one
of the things that led to the cinematographing trip
across Australia which Alma Baker and Kidman were
preparing being put off till March.

“Bert R.”: In Graham’s Creek, Yengarie
(Q.), a few years ago, it was no uncommon thing
to get barramundi weighing 451 b. to 781 b. on a
hand line. They made splendid eating. But better
sport was shark fishing at the mouth of the Burrem
River. White sharks and tiger sharks abounded
there. The record catch was made by one Smith.
His minnow, when laid on two drays, still
left its tail without support. It was taken into
Maryborough, where it was photographed a hundred
times a day, and the amount of free beer consumed
became a legend in the North.

“E.J.C.”: Just near here (Albion, Bris-
bane) there is an abandoned brickyard, within which
are three excavations, now, and for the last 10
years, off and on, filled with brick-colored fluid.
They are artificial and not connected with any stream,
yet it is quite a common occurrence for the kids
to arrive home with an eel about 12 inches long.
They tell me the holes are full of them. How does

“V.D.”: Bathers off the eastern ocean
beaches of Australia find the sea invariably icy-cold
during westerly winds (hot or cold) and almost
lukewarm while south-easterly gales are raging.
Along this coast at a distance of a few miles from
land is a broad, swiftly-flowing warm current from
the tropics. A blustering westerly will disturb the
course of this current and blow it far out to sea,
and in its place a cold body of water sets in from
the south. On the other hand, a strong sou’-easter
drives the warm current right inshore, and thus,
notwithstanding that the weather may be bitterly
cold, the surfer revels in water which is practically
lukewarm.
October 21 is the anniversary of Trafal-
gar, so a large-size model of Nelson’s Vic-
tory will be exhibited by the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Co. in the Tourist
Bureau window, Martin Place, on October
20 and subsequent days.


Some Day You’ll Get

a Thrashing.
Some day you'll be called upon to defend yourself.
Suppose, for instance, some bumptious fellow insulted you, what would be
your position'?
A\ ould you be able to fittingly avenge such an insult, or in trying to do
so would you run the risk of getting a severe thrashing, owing to your
inability to defend yourself—to prove yourself a man ?
\ou never know what the future holds in store for you, so be prepared—
learn the art of self-defence. Start TO-DAY—not next week, but NOW.

WHINNEY, SMITH AND WHINNEY, Chartered Accountants, Auditors.
London, 10th July, 1917.
“Masetto”: It is close on 40 years since
tuneful old “Les Cloches” was first staged
here. Clara Thompson, Nellie Lambert,
Bracy and W. H. Wallace figured in the
original, and three years afterwards Edwin
Kelly gave his remarkable characterisation
of the Miser. A following revival had
Nellie Stewart as Serpolette, the only time,
I think, she and Kelly ever played together.
In that production Beaumont was the Gren-
icheux. Just 30 years ago Maggie Moore
sang Serpolette, and Wm. Elton was the
Miser. I think the last showing was by
Wren’s National Opera Co. at the Royal in
1008. No one got excited over it.
The natural theatricalism of the late Her-
bert Tree was redeemed by a good sense of
humor. Off the stage and on it he was an
actor —always an actor—but he never in his
heart took himself too seriously. He wanted
no post-mortem fuss or feathers. His will
said: “I desire that my body shall be cre-
mated, and that my funeral shall be simple
and private.” Less than a score of relatives
and friends attended the burning, the only
“nob” in the party being the Duke of Rut-
land.
“Bluebeard”: When in England in 1910
I called on Mrs. Brown Potter and found
her at Staines, in the Old Bridge House,
just by the Thames. It was originally a
hunting-box of Henry No. 8. and some fine
old trees were still flourishing in the gar-
den. The Cora Urquhart Potter of old
days had changed much, but at that time
she still wore a shock of magenta hair.
(They say it is white now!) After the
financial debacle caused by staging plays
at the Savoy Theatre in conjunction with
Gilbert Hare, she gathered up the remains
of her artistic possessions from Bray Lodge,
Maidenhead, and made another home at
Staines. As she had a fine decorative sense
the house was charming. She was then
just back from an unsuccessful tour in
America, and expressed the wish to return
to Australia; but as she had parted with
her co-manager. Ivyrle Bellew, the tour did
not get past the talking stage. She was
then playing a minor tour in “Lady Fred-
erick,” and still retained that rather fas-
cinating exotic intenseness and eccentric
character that made her so interesting.
“Stargazer”: I wonder if ever a cheekier
thing than “Out There” has been imposed
upon an ingenuous people as a play! We
are told that it had a tremendous success in
America, and made gallons and gallons of
money for the inventor and producer. If so,
there must have been some very extraordi-
nary character-acting. Only that could make
it momentarily satisfactory; for however
enthusiastic a man may be in his desire to
have the Hun undone, he is not likely to be
content to pay for a very ordinary address
of the “Johnnie get your gun” variety mas-
querading as dramatic art. If he has no
other objection, he will resent the idea of
anybody making money out of the recruiting
movement.
“Norbell”: To “Futsac” (B. 27/9/T7),
, who remarked that the highest wage paid to
an actor for work in an Australian film is,
so far as he knows, £7 a week on a month’s
engagement. I would like to say that George
Musgrove offered me £8 a week for six weeks
to play in the “Sweet Nell” picture, and
Harcourt Beatty told me that more than
twice that much had been pressed on him to
be King Charles in the same production.
Neither of us was able to accept. But I
grant that George Musgrove was the liberal
exception that proves the close-fisted rule.
I have been paid 10s. a day for bushranging
in a Kelly-gang picture, and had to do
Steve Hart, Aaron Sherritt and sundry
policemen, and gallop over rough country to
earn the donation. In this respect the
Actors’ Association has been rather a start-
ling proposition. Originally created as a
counterblast to the struggling Actors’ Union,
and as a kind of superior protest against—-
haw —Trades Hall ideas, and to demonstrate
the beauty of Art for Art’s sake, etc., the
Association did its damnedest to help the
managements squelch the union. Having
succeeded, it now throws a complete somer-
sault and wants to register itself as a
beastly trade organisation!
Actor Winter Hall sees the light, and inci-
dentally the dollars, in movie work in
U.S.A. Hall earned his early crust as a
schoolmaster in Christchurch (M.L.), and
the dictatorial habit was his handicap in
drama. The cinema should suit better.
Recently Mrs. Hall, who used to be M.L.
pianiste Katie Young, left Sydney (and
Farmer’s orchestra) to join Winter in
Wilson’s Land.
London has had the pluck to screen vari-
ous captured films, made in Germany with
the evident idea of reassuring the Germans
and impressing all neutrals as to the Bosche
strength of arms. “Know Your Enemy” is
the neat title given to the show.
“Billy B.”: Blot out “Row A.’s” worst
song in the world (B. 4/10/T7) and substi-
tute this: —
Shall we gather at the river?
If we do I’ll have to swim.
One more question. How’s your liver ?
Give my Sunday pants to Jim.
That’s all I’ll inflict on you. Charlie Hugo
used to bawl it.
TO A ’CELLIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Draw with your bow the mellow wine of dreams
From that rich wood and those tense, vibrant
strings.
I would sit long by Music’s golden streams
And sip the draught of Memory where gleams
The sweetness of the past. Each note that sings
And trembles into silence is a drop
Helping to fill the goblet to the top.
Draw with your bow the magic wine that stills
The voice of care and drugs the wearied heart!
Brimming at last, the long-held goblet spills
The trembling treasure, till in ruby rills
It runs to waste and makes the dreamer start....
Drunkard of Dreams, awake! What have you done ?
The cup is shattered and the wine has run!

Front View of Meggitt’s Mill.
Parramatta Mill Now Able to Produce
WHole Oil Consumption of Australia.
HE Directors of Meggitt Ltd. are pleased to announce that, owing to the whole-hearted
support of the oil buyers, painters and the separate State Governments, they have been
encouraged, during the past five years, to add, from time to time, extensively to their
already big oil mill at Parramatta. During the past five months final additions of new
machinery, of two new oil tanks —making in all six oil tanks, each capable of maturing 60,000
gallons of oil —and by the erection and purchase of new storage buildings, the mill is now capable
of supplying the whole of the requirements of linseed oil in Australia.
Before the war the total consumption of oil in Australia was about 1,600,000 gallons.
Meggitt’s Mill is now capable of producing 1,500,000 gallons per year.
It should be advised that the growth of the business has been so remarkable, and the
difficulty of obtaining supplies of seed, drums, cases, and barrels, has been so great, that it has not
been possible to supply clients on immediate receipt of orders. This inconvenience will soon
be overcome.
When it is realised that the milks production jumped from 500,000 gallons in 1914 to
1,200,000 in 1916-1917, buyers will gain an idea of the work entailed and the difficulties that
have been overcome.
All the above statements in regard to the intentions of Meggitt Ltd. are, of course, subject
to the safe landing ot already-purchased supplies of linseed.
It is also hoped that New Zealand and the Islands will be catered for in the near future.

Food is as important to the sick person as
medicine, more so in most cases. A badly-
chosen diet may retard recovery.
In health the natural appetite is the best
guide to follow; in sickness the appetite is
often fickle and depraved.
Proper food and a gopd tonic will keep
most people in good health. Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills are the most popular tonic medi-
cine in the world, harmless, non-alcoholic,
and certain in their action, which is to help
build the blood and to restore vitality to the
run-down system. For growing girls who
become thin and pale, for pale, tired women,
for old people who fail in strength. Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills are an ideal tonic.
To enable those who give these pills a
trial to observe intelligent care in the diet,
the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. will send
free on request a diet book, “What to Eat
and How to Eat.” It is full of useful infor-
mation, and whether you are well or ill it
is a good book to have. A postcard request
will bring it, if you mention The Bulletin.

This is the Pen
for Active Service
—because it stands the racket.
The “Swan,” like a rifle, is made
true and sure. The ink magazine is
ample and, at command, the pen is
ready for duty immediately. There is
no misfiring, and there are no parts liable
to derangement. When fluid ink is un-
obtainable the magazine may be charged
with ink pellets for use with water.
Send one to your soldier friend. It will make wri-
ting easier and encourage him to send more letters.

unless stamps accompany.
D.D.A.: Those gags have to be very smart
to pass John A. S.: Can’t say that reducing the
percentage of alcohol in spirits would do much
good. It would probably lead to an extension of the
pernicious habit of stirring one’s drinks with a stick
of nailrod. .. .A. J. Vogan: (1) No man is quicker
to give credit to the English troops than Bean ; (2)
His recent cables are not accounts of the line-long
battles, but a summary of what the Australians have
been doing (that’s what he’s there for) ; (3) The
published percentage rates have nothing to do with
his story; (4) The one sensible thing about your
yelp is: “I know that you will not use it.’’....
Corrigenda : All right, we’ll tell him and let it go at
that.... Belladonna: They used to manufacture medi-
cine from that source, anyhow.... Cora Lynn: Don’t
understand your question. What had the bell to do
with the game ?.... Derwentsider: Hammered that
law already... .J.A.K.: “With humble apologies to
Gilbert and Sullivan.” We should think so!....
J.E.H. (M.L.): Well, well: but you didn’t say who the
brilliant M.L. ass was that made the remarks about the
low-down Australians. ... Hart: Doesn’t suit us, but
there are others.... Sliprail: The instructions to the
press prohibit even that much. . . . I.B.: “Spring” is
very crude... .W.V.A.: “Lights Out” may be photo-
graphic, but its interest isn’t sufficient.... W.C.:
“Bob” has a made-to-order look... .Nairda: Don’t
quite do the trick... .J.R.N.: Not bad as a shout,
but doesn’t carry much thought... .E.B.: “Gallipoli
Day” doesn’t score... .E.O.V.: No use. Don’t write
on both sides of the paper if you value your health.
F.S.T.: “A Prayer” is the sort of verse any-
body whose soul would allow him to could string off
by the mile... .D.M.: The dream is too muddled and
out of tune... .E.C.: The tragic spot fails to thrill
us H.P.T.: Hopeless C.R. J.: Sorry; it misses.
. ...E.A.V.: No... .B.W.H.: Preachy commonplace.
... .O.B.: There’s a thrill in that: —
Now think it over, Billy dear,
Free yourself of that tax ;
Marry the one, have no fear
As I am telling you the fax.
To pop the question, Billy,
It’s not so hard as you think.
Make up your mind, don't be silly
Because, I know you have the chink.
... .R.D.A.I.: Goes lamely... .L.R.T.: Beyond the
invention of a new word or two, there’s nothing in
it. . . . R.R.R.: Horrible exhibition of unrhvmed
spleen... .C.J.W.: Not much song about it....S.B.:
Commonplace and lumpy.... E’.R.: Verse too rough.
... .Trooper W.: We’ve seen worse first attempts.
Wongabri: Not up....K.K.: Not quite. .. .O.N.S.:
Take the thing away and bury it where it can't be
heard.... Old Salt: Can’t find the alleged smile....
A.M.T. (or something else under the blot) : Hopeless.
.... J.M.P.: Too slight.... A.W.O.: Obvious remarks
in commonplace verse cannot score. .. .M.E.K.:
Feeble thing fluttered to death. . . . A.G.S.: Not up.
....Danny: It has promise. Take more care....
F. : It’s a long way off. . . . J.H.: “The Vision”
doesn’t go brightly enough... .Clyne Allets: Heavy
stuff with no new thought. .. .G.A.M.C.: Verse too
rough... .W.H.D.: Wallow and sag and wobble and
bump and half an idea to a dozen lines of it. .. .
G. : “Blinks” is an old yarn not too well told.
. .. .F.L.H.: Don’t send us chopped prose. Put
your thoughts in honest rhyme and rhythm....
Buzfuz: No... . J.C.T.: Commonplace... .A.W.K.:
No use. .. .C.M.M.: Doesn’t work....A.C.V.: Misses.
. . . .M.D.: Wanted finer handling. . . .I.D.: Don’t know
about the lover being careless; the writer seems
tolerably incoherent. .. .E.H.P.: Not up... .E.N.D.:
Not well enough done... . A.R.: Fearful...-P.C.:
“Unrequited” and “Old Days” fail... .Bellerive:
The “Scene at Suburb Hotel” is full of human in-
' west:—•
Sticking plasters adorned O’Grady’s face,
Pat Murphy was blind in one eye,
O’Connor had a lump on he’s cheek
Half the size of a penny meat pie.
The hotel parlor was under repair,
An expensive mirror was smashed,
A couple of chairs lay twisted and broke,
Near the table where Dillon got bashed,
The pub bruiser had he’s arm in a sling.
Which was broke from the result of a fall,
In a gallant endeavor to rescue the boots,
Who’d got mixed in the drunken brawl,
The proprietor performed like an angry bull,
Called the rioter’s miscreants and hull’s,
Whom ought to be placed in a bloomin’ line,
And riddled by british guns.
....Assisted Imm.: It’s a plain, baldheaded yarn.
. ...Gainil A.: Glad to consider anything of the
kind.
TO ARTISTIC CAND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.D.B. : Unsuitable. .. .F.D.: If you want to draw
why don’t you learn how?. .. .A.B.C.: Sad things.
. ...Batt.: Drawing of a dreary cove... .E.H.: Old
gag —gloomy drawing. . . .Hyra: Afraid not. .. .C.F.:
Don’t want the flat draper. .. .V.C.P.: Sour little
figures. . . . J.B.: Scratches and blots. .. .Dis: Why
did you make the defiant Irish lady a black gin?. . . .
E.J.R.: Very rocky attempt. .. .Fred C.: Creaky joke
to a crude drawing.... Mrs. H. W. P.: Study for a
few years and observe people and cows. .. .K.T. :
Flat both ways... .E.R.: Sorry, no place for that
nice young officer. .. .D.S.G.: Too close to a well-
known American drawing.
This from the inside: —
Sweet stories of Melbourne’s municipal Council
Chamber are going the rounds. Seems that if the
scale hadn’t turned in favor of architect Stapley his
prospects of an early future gaud mayorship must
have been blighted. The Hennessy party had arranged
that councillors Allen and Aikman be his
successors in due course, Allen to come first in order
of selection. A humorously-melodramatic incident
of the election was the exposure of a voter’s breach
of promise to his friend and one-time school-
mate. This unfortunate had promised his friend
that he would vote for Stapley, and when
he had filled in his paper he agrain assured
the vigilant canvasser that it was “all right.”
Whereupon his old friend told Smith, the candid foe
of the perennial Gaud Mayor, that the other fellow
had voted the right ticket. “Don’t you believe it,”
said Smith, “when he was holding his paper so that
you couldn't see it / saw ‘Sir David’ written on
it.” Then they turned on the promise-breaker and
reproached him so bitterly that he fled from the Coun-
cil Chamber when the result was announced, and didn’t
turn up to partake of the noble luncheon which
Hennessy had ordered in anticipation of the victory
that came not to pass.

Weakness
Every movement of the
body uses up a definite
amount of vitality’. That
is why you feel tired at
the end of the day. When
you overtax yourself, or
when your vitality is
undermined by illness,
your whole system be-
comes too exhausted to
recover its lost vitality
without assistance. Your
system is like a plant that
is drooping for want of
water. And just as water
revives a drooping plant—
so ‘Wincarnis’ gives new
life and new vitality to a
weakened constitution.
Because 1 Wincarnis ’ pos-
sesses a four-fold power.
It is a Tonic, a Restora-
tive, a Blood-maker and
a nerve Food—all in one.
Therefore
[TV
The Wine of Life
creates new strength, new
blood, new nerve force,
and new vitality. The
benefit begins from the
first wineglassful. You
can feel it doing you
good. You can feel every
wineglassful giving you
more strength than you
had before, and surcharg-
ing your whole system
with new vitality’. That
is why over 10,000 Doctors
recommend ‘Wincarnis.’

SPECIALIST EXPLAINS CAUSE OF
STOMACH TROUBLE.
VALUABLE ADVICE TO SUFFERERS.
“There are many different forms of
stomach trouble,” said a well-known special-
ist recently, “but practically all are trace-
able to excessive acidity and food fermenta-
tion. That is why the results obtained from
the use of drugs are usually so disappoint-
ing. Admitting fermentation and consequent
acidity of the food contents to be the under-
lying cause of most forms of indigestion, it
naturally follows that the use of a reliable
antacid, such as bisurated magnesia, which
is so frequently prescribed by physicians, will
produce better results than drugs or combi-
nation of drugs. Accordingly I almost in-
variably advise those who complain of diges-
tive trouble to get some bisurated magnesia
(note the name carefully, as other forms are
not so suitable for this purpose) from their
chemist, and take half a teaspoonful of the
powder, or two 5-grain compressed tablets,
with a little water after meals. This, by
immediately neutralising the acid and stop-
ping the fermentation, removes the cause ot
the trouble and insures normal and healthy
digestion.”— Advt.

IN BANANA LAND
Passed out suddenly in Brisbane a few
days ago, George Townsend, a well-known
public servant. Born in 1850 he arrived in
Queensland at the age of 16 in the sailing-
ship Netherby. In ’75 he was appointed a
sub-inspector of black police, being stationed
at several places in the North, including
the Palmer goldfields during the time that
P. F. Sellheim, the father of Brig.-General
Sellheim, was warden. He retired from the
service in 1879, but re-entered it in 1884 and
was attached to. the Immigration Depart-
ment. In 1893 he transferred to the Labor
Bureau, and while Superintendent of Labor
he was murderously attacked and seriously
hurt by a stranger. His widow is a daughter
of the late John Sinclair, who wore the rab-
bit-skins in Brisbane the year that George
AVindsor and his brother visited Australia
as boys. An only son is at present chasing
Abdui.
Of the new appointees in the Legislative
Council, two are owners and editors of news-
papers—lrvine Perel, editor and proprietor
of Brisbane Patriot (and one of the
trustees under John Norton’s will) and Billy
Demaine, of Maryborough Alert. Crampton
is general-manager of the Daily Standard,
and Sumner, ex-M,L.A. and fruit-canner, is
a director of the same paper. Then there
are: AY. J. Riordan, president of the
A.AV.U. in Queensland; Page Hanify,
manufacturer and temperance advocate;
Courtice, a Bundaberg farmer; Purnell, a
union secretary at Rockhampton; Tom
Nevitt, quarantine officer at Townsville and
formerly M.L.A. for Carpentaria; H.
Llewellyn, a Gympie bookseller; Lewis
McDonald, secretary of the C.P.E.; Private
H. C. Jones, who lost a thumb at Quinn’s
Post; and Randolph Bedford. Ryan
promises another contingent of eight at an
early date, and perhaps a further instalment
later on. Instead of three, the Government
will now have 16 supporters in the Council,
with the prosnect of an early increase to 24.
Even then it will be nine short of a majority.
Another relic has gone. The “Endeavor”
tree at Cooktown, to which Captain Cook is
supposed to have moored his packet in 1770
(don’t start this dog-fight all over again),
has been destroyed by fire. For some years
past the aged vegetable has had to be propped
up. Its breast proudly bore a brass plate,
describing its alleged history, affixed to it by
Captain \V. C. Thompson.
Three good Brisbane pressmen recently
went out in France. Lieut. Charlie Scott,
after gaining the Military Cross for brilliant
reconnoitring work at Bullecourt, fell at
Messines. He was one of the best of the
Courier’s youngest men. Sergeant Arthur
Foott, a clever son of Mary Hannay Foott
and author of many a bright Bulletin par,
got the fatal bullet in Septembex\ In
between chasing news for the Daily Stan-
dard he studied and obtained a commission
in the Rifle Club Reserve, and then hopped
into the A.I.F. But he discarded the star
wffien he thought he would be more useful in
the Pioneers, and left with that lot as a
sergeant. A widow and small daughter are
mourning. Brigadier-General Foott, C.M.G.,
of A.I.F. Headquarters, England, is a brother.
Private Mick Cantwell, who pushed a pen
for the Sun, a weekly paper, was the third
to give his useful life.
The Ministry is giving a grant of £1552
to assist Dr. Waite, of the Rockefeller Insti-
tute in his campaign against the hook-worm.
The bulk of the expenses of the campaign
are being borne by the U.S.A. organisation,
but Bananaland’s contribution is to meet
certain expenditure in other scientific direc-
tions. Waite’s investigations will extend
from Thursday Island to Brisbane; all hook-
worm sufferers will be treated, and instruc-
tion will be given in methods of preventing
the disease.
“Eloc”: How is this for a bullock? He
was bred on the Diamantina, travelled to
Adelaide (1000 miles), and then turned the
scales at 19961 b. dressed. His weight before
slaughter was 30431 b. Reckon he is a world
beater or close up.
Randolph Bedford writes :
The Commission appointed by Queensland Govern-
ment to inquire into the Wando Vale matter results
in Vowles, M.L.A. for Dalby, who made the charges,
being made to look like fourpence-ha’penny in
coppers. Wando Vale is one of the Government
cattle stations, and was bought for £82,000, as to
£lO,OOO cash and the balance in 10-year debentures.
The charges were that the station could have been
acquired for £45,000, and part of the suggested
graft was mentioned as £5OOO to Treasurer Theo-
dore. Never was there a meaner justification of
slander than the “corroboration” offered at the in-
quiry ; mostly as side-stepping of the words “graft”
A SAFE BET.
ANXIOUS OWNER: “Do you think he'll stay?”
JOCKEY: "Not a doubt of it, sir. Before we've got any distance he'll be last; and you
can go broke, sir, he’ll stay there right to the bloomin’ finish!”
and “corruption” and the substitution of ‘‘smellful”
and “unbusinesslike.” The seller and the Trustees
Co. manager concerned in the sale showed that
£82,000 was paid by the Government to the Trustees
Co., and by it remitted to the owner, less only £B5O
as commission to the Pastoral Agency Co. which in-
troduced the business. Other witnesses showed that
at £82,000 Wando Vale is a good bargain, and that
its present value is a big increase on tlie purchase.
The £45,000 quoted was for the station in 1912—a
very inferior station to that bought in 1916. All the
envy, hatred, malice and uncharitableness of a mean
and impotent opposition was given an advertisement
that will not soon be forgotten. This Wando Vale
business is one of many equally baseless slanders on
the Government. I have been told a score of times
that one Minister got £21,000 graft in the Mount
Hutton purchase, that another refused a co-operative
mill to Childers because he was not given £2OOO.
Seeing that the mill was to be built with Govern-
ment money, the Lord only knows where he was to
get the £2OOO, unless he pinched it direct from the
Treasury.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Across the last blue range the grey land
lies
Flat as the basin of some ancient sea,
The mirage haunts her spaces mockingly,
Amid the Mitchell grass the dry wind sighs.
A pale infinity of empty skies,
Some homesteads with a budding almond-
tree,
Stray flocks of sheep—plains to eternity,
AA r here like a lantern-shape the red sun dies.
Ah, she is old! you feel the truth at night.
All day her alien spirit dwells apart,
Dreaming perchance of long-dry ocean bars;
But when her wastes are swept with silver
light
She whispers the lost sea-songs of her heart,
And tells her brooding memories to the stars.

My Dear Thargomindah,—
The appointments to the Leg. Council are
out at last, and the land is filled with the
mutterings of the 1270 unsuccessful candi-
dates. Randolph Bedford’s appointment,
though not the biggest surprise of the lot,
has caused the most heated debates. The
Council is a diverting sight these days—bin:
wait a bit!
The Anglican Synod has been sitting this
week. On Monday his Gaiters entertained
the synodsmen and their wives at the usual
garden flutter. The Gov. and Lady Goold-
Adams, the Premier and Mrs. Ryan, Home
Secretary and Mrs. Huxham and the
Mayor and Mayoress were among the
visitors. The Mayoress had a birthday this
week, and to celebrate it gave a party at
the Cooee Cafe. Mrs. T. J. Ryan passed
the happy-returns on behalf of the well-
wishers.
C. T. Wood, a member of Hansard staff,
and formerly on the Telegraph, was ad-
mitted as a barrister at the Full Court sit-
tings on Tuesday. “Woodsey” is the second
Telegraph scribbler to be called to the Bar.
T. AY. Bain, now leader-writer on that very
respectable journal, led the way.
Killed in action in France, Lieut. Norman
Waraker, son of the late Deputy Surveyor-
General. He was a popular Brisbane

athlete. Another Brisbane boy who fell in
France recently was Odo Hopkins, son of
our well-liked medico.
A coin tea and at home took place in the
rooms of the Allies’ Babies’ Clothing Society
on Tuesday afternoon. The object was to

fair amount of the needful came to light—
but it could have been a lot more without
injury to the financial stability of the gather-

Cooktown Chamber of Commerce recently
rummaged in the ocean bed off the Great
Barrier Reef and secured a few samples of
sponges. An expert declares them excellent
for industrial purposes; their shape and
color are all that can be desired, and there
would be no waste in trimming or sub-
dividing. A sponge weighing three-quarters
of an ounce dry absorbed water till, without
drip, it weighed ounces. Their tough-
ness is equal to most sponges now on the
market, and their elasticity is unusually
good. They are too hard for toilet purposes-
but the demand for hard sponges for indus-
trial purposes is about 10 times that of * o ft
bath sponges. The expert winds up by tell-
ing the Bureau of Science and Industry
that “the Cooktown sponge may have to
contend with that prejudice against Austra-
lian products which is noticed in other direc-
tions.” Of course.
“L.S.”: Bananaland had some little ex-'
perience of the notorious Paul Rene Loubet.
who after a brief term as assistant medical-
officer at Goodna Asylum became locum
tenens at the Blackall Hospital. With him
was a fine-looking woman, with a superb
figure, who was alleged to be his wife and
who attracted so much attention amongst
some •of the young squatters that Loubet
made, at least, one attempt to shoot her. He
performed a number of operations during
his four months’ stay in Blackall, and
although they were to all appearances suc-
cessful the victims are feeling rather
squeamish in view r of recent disclosures.
Loubet’s well-knit figure, suave manner,
pleasing disposition and conversational
abilities made him as great a centre of
attraction to the womenfolk as his consort
was amongst the men.
“Warrego Bill”: Brisbane Courier has
revived the delightful idiosyncrasy of insert-
ing editorial comments into “interviews.” A
sample:—
Mr. Ryan emphasised the point that the Queens-
land Government was not concerned with the origi-
nal cause of the trouble, nor with its merits or
demerits. [Ha. Ha.—Ed.] The Government was
concerned only with the restoration of inter-State
trade. [Ha. Ha. Again! —Ed.]
But w-hy not “Ho, ho!” occasionally?

SPECIFICATIONS —FOUR
The Studebaker Series “18” FOUR at is one of the highest
grade four-cylinder cars on the market.
The chassis is perfected from four years of study on one basic design,
based on the experience of 250,000 Studebaker cars in service in all parts
of the world.
The body work is as fine as the highest grade materials and best work-
manship can produce. The finish is hand applied—twenty-five operations.
The upholstering is made of genuine leather on genuine long curled hair
over the best coiled spring frame work.
The top is of high-grade mohair edged with leather.
The tonneau carpet is high-grade fabric, bound with leather.
The equipment throughout is distinctly high grade. Even an expensive
Yale Tumbler Lock is provided for the Ignition switch.
In short, the Studebaker FOUR is distinctly the greatest motor car
value on the market to-day at any price. You CANNOT afford to pay
LESS for a four-cylinder car when you can obtain this quality at
it is absolutely unnecessary to pay more.
Steadily increasing ocean freight will undoubtedly cause us to increase
our retail price. Cars now on the water were purchased before the last
increase at the factory on September 15 —and at favorable freight rates.
Early deliveries —NOW \s your opportunity.

Simple and Effective Methods.

London, Eng.
Grey Hair—Home Kemedy.
There are plenty of reasons why grey hair
is not desirable, and plenty of reasons why
hair dyes should not be used. But, on the
other hand, there is no reason why you should
have grey hair if you do not want it. To turn
Ihe hair back to a natural color is really a
very simple matter. One has only to get frotn
the chemist two ounces of concentrate of tam-
malite and mix it with three ounces of bay
rum. Apply to the hair with a small sponge
for a few nights and the greyness will gradu-
ally disappear. This liquid is not sticky or
greasy, and does not injure the hair in any
way. It has been used for generations with
most satisfactory results by those who have
known the formula.
Blackheads Fly Away.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now coming into gen-
eral use in the boudoir. It is very simple,
harmless and pleasant. Drop a stymol tablet
obtained at the chemist’s, in a tumbler full of
hot water. After the effervescence has sub-
sided bathe the face in the liquid, using a
small sponge or soft cloth. In a few minutes
dry the face and the offensive blackheads will
come right off on the towel. Also the large
oily pores immediately close up and efface
themselves naturally. The greasiness dis-
appears and the skin is left smooth, soft and
cool. This simple treatment is then repeated
a few times at intervals of four or five days
to ensure the permanence of the result.
Emergency Complexions.
Even a complexion which is hopelessly dull
or greasy can be made beautiful in a moment
by a perfectly harmless home recipe. If you
have no cleminite in the house, get about an
ounce from your chemist, and add only
enough water to dissolve it. The process de-
fies detection, and the result is an immediate
appearance of velvety, youthful “bloom”
which every woman desires. The effect will
last all day under the most trying conditions,
indoors or out, and renders powdering quite
unnecessary. This simple substance is also
very good for the skin, and no possible harm
can come from its regular use.
Effectually Killing Superfluous Hair.
Many women know how to remove ugly
growths of superfluous hair temporarily, but
few know how to remove it permanently. For
this purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
used. Get about an ounce from your chemist
and apply a little directly to the objection-
able hair. _ The purpose of the recommended
treatment is not merely to remove the super-
fluous hair instantly, but also to kill the hair
roots completely in a comparatively short
time.
How Nature Makes New Complexions.
It is well known that the human skin is
constantly undergoing a tearing down and
building up process. With advancing years or
waning vitality this tissue-change lags: the
lifeless, soiled surface skin stays on so long
that its owner gets a “poor complexion.”
Commonsense tells us this dead skin cannot
be enlivened or beautified by any cosmetic,
lotion or powder. The natural thing to do is
to actually remove the offensive skin—remove
the bad complexion. It has been found that
ordinary mercolized wax completely absorbs
the devitalised skin, in minute particles, so
gently, gradually, as to cause no inconveni-
ence. Mercolized wax, which any chemist can
supply, is put on at night like cold cream,
and washed off in the morning. If you would
have a brilliantly beautiful and youthful com-
plexion, just use this simple treatment.
How to Have Thick and Pretty Hair.
Soaps and artificial shampoos ruin many
beautiful heads of hair. Few people know
that a teaspoonful of good stallax dissolved
in a cup of hot water has a natural affinity
for the hair and makes the most delightful
shampoo imaginable. It leaves the hair bril-
liant, soft and wavy, cleanses the scalp com-
pletely, and greatly stimulates the hair-
growth. The only drawback is that stallax
seems rather expensive. It comes to the

“P.N.”: An interesting occupation is fol-
lowed by a pair of lady-canvassers who arc
quite well known as agents for a nice thing
in corsets. As a sideline they carry a handy
stock of expensive medicines for ladies who
don't wish to undertake family responsi-
bilities —and it is out of the sideline that
the pair of beauties are making a neat for-
tune. And Australia, hungering for people
—Oh, Australia doesn't matter!
“Seven Bells”: When a vessel with 1000
returned men aboard arrived at Port Mel-
bourne, Billjim was welcomed as he deserved
to be. But a batch of sailors who had come
back from the North Sea were sneaked over
to Williamstown in an unobtrusive boat, and
there deprived of their cap ribbons, bearing
their vessel’s name, and furnished with plain
ones. Then they were allowed to tiptoe
home—no music, no motor-cars, no nothing!
Among them was one lad three years and
eight months absent. The boys in khaki who
remember the bluejackets that rowed them
ashore on April 25, 1915, want to know
whaffor. Surely the Department has nothing
to lose by giving Jack a share in the welcome
to which he is entitled?
“T.O.I.”: The Cooper family of Sydney
—the founder made enough to buy a baron-
etcy—is disposing of all its real estate in
N. S. Wales. A portion of the family money
has been invested in an up-to-date watering-
place on the Essex coast. Here theatres,
music-halls and pubs are barred. On the
plans a Sydney man, resident for a time in
the neighborhood, saw a lot that he thought
would be a good site for an up-to-date hotel.
At the office he was told that the Colchester
Brewery Co. owned the lot and was patiently
waiting for time to lift the embargo on pubs.
From this restful watering-place even negro-
minstrels on the sands are prohibited. The
place is called Frinton-on-Sea.
Sydney’s North Shore has still a great
deal of natural bush, and the unobtrusive
death-adder is even now slain on the wilder
suburban roads. A group of over-the-PIar-
bor men were comparing nature notes on
the morning boat, and the man with the
most extensive garden told how he had
captured a giant brown snake, cherished
many harmless blue-tongued lizards and
occasionally slain a native cat. “I haven’t
seen any live snakes yet,” said the new
resident humbly; “but I’ve been bitten regu-
larly twice a day by the Sydney Ferries.”
“Globe”: One curious wireless freak that
I met with was coming from Aden to
Colombo. Colombo station is right on the
sea front facing the west. I worked it two days
out; but when 150 miles off the only way to
get traffic away was to send it 900 miles
to Bombay, which relayed it back, all traffic
being then exchanged at a good rate without
a repeat. Again, when about Cocos Island
one can only work Perth, though Geraldton
is nearer; but when coming the southern
circular route, Capetown to Fremantle,
Geraldton, though much further north, is
the first station that speaks for Australia.
Both these stations, by the way, are badly
placed, because ships at the Leeuwin, where
many wrecks have taken place, are abso-
lutely out of communication.
A horribly-humorous item of recent war
news was that the first thing the Germans
did after getting control of Riga was to hang
150 Russian Socialists. These were some of
the wild and woolly dreamers who had yelled
for a cessation of fighting with Germany
because it was “a war of annexation.”
Whereupon the Huns annexed Riga and
hanged the peacemakers. Something of that
sort will be happening in Australia one of
these days. The Socialistic peacemakers will
meet the invader with a banner, inscribed
“No Conscription. No Opposition. No
Bloodshed.” And the invader will just hang
them for the sake of peace and quiet.
A Sydney officer, who now owns a Mili-
tary Cross, tells of one phase of a bombard-
ment near Pozieres, where he was buried
more than once. In the last burying only
his head was visible, and he called for help
to a passing Scot. “Nae, nae, mon,” said
the kiltie, “I’ll nae help ye. Ye are well under
cover and had better stay there,” and he
went forward, leaving the officer to be re-
lieved by somebody else when there was
less iron in the air.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: At a function
recently held at the Deanery, near St.
Andrew’s Cathedral, it was stated that the
house was an ancient landmark of Sydney.
As a matter of fact it dates only from the
first ’70’s. The contract was let in
August, 1871. In digging the foundations
many an old coffin was broken into, for the
site had been part of an old cemetery.
“Mynna": Somebody has been swinging-
on “Tc Whare’s” limb (B. 27/9/’17). He
says that the Historical Society has been
cutting out for preservation a hole at Wool-
lahra Point, Sydney, made by de Quiros and
his men about the 16th century. The soci-
ety knows nothing about such a hole. Car-
dinal Moran landed De Quiros at Port
Curtis and Lawrence Hargraves plumped
for Lope de Vega at Woollahra Point. But
Sir Clements Markham, the leading English
authority on Spanish voyages, summed up
his opinion of all such alleged landings in
Australia in these words : “I think you will be
doing useful work in exploding absurd
stories which are so injurious to sound
geographical research.”
Forty-five per cent, of the students trained
at Wagga Experiment Farm (N.S.W.) have
offered to shoulder arms and 245 have been
accepted. Among them are two majors, one
staff-captain, two captains, 24 lieutenants
and eight non-coms. Distinctions gained com-
prise three “mentions,” one D.C.M. and five
Military Crosses, and a bar has been
awarded twice. Twenty-three have been
killed.

STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought ami experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. We
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid “cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried bv thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn't got it in
stock it will be sent, to any address
postage paid, upon receipt of price by
SUNSET DRUG CO.,
Cr. Goodlet & Riley Streets, Sydney.
Try This Corn Cure.
You will never know how easy it is to
get rid of corns until you have tried
Handy Corn Cure. Nothing like it has
ever been produced.
r>
Oh! My! Corn-pains in every nerve!
It will dumbfound you, especially if
you liave tried everything else for corns—
applied in two seconds, and if it does
not cure your corns we will refund your
money.
If you have ever made a fat bundle of
your toes with bandages ; used thick,
corn pressing rings ; corn pulling salves
or liquid medicines that took off more
toe than corn—well, you will appreciate.
Handy Corn Cure. Try Handy Corn
Cure for any corn, callous, wart or
bunion. It never fails.

ORAN MV CHAMBERLAIN
1 , , (COPYHICnTcoI
Wet weather caused Phil’s bad cold. He got wet through
going to the office one morning and came home that night with an awful cold. But I
relied on my tried friends—Granny Chamberlain and Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy—to
get rid of it as quickly as possible. I gave him a few doses that night and he took a bottle
to the office next morning. That night he came home as well as ever.
Chamberlain’s
is certainly a preparation that can always be
depended upon to relieve colds at any time.
Any one who has had experience in the use
of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy will tell
you this. It is not necessary to take it in
time to get the best results for it relieves
colds-—anybody’s cold—at any time.
I have found that when one has contracted
Cough Remedy
a cold it is no time to experiment. You
want to get rid of it as quickly as possible,
for every cold weakens the lungs, lowers
the vitality and paves the way for more
serious diseases.

Chamberlain s’*
DID YOU KNOW
That the manufacturers of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, which is the
largest selling and most successful medicine of its kind in the world, also
make CHAMBERLAIN’S TABLETS for the Stomach and Liver? Chamberlain’s
Tablets are a new and improved remedy for Biliousness and Disorders of the Stomach, Diver and Bowels ; they have met
with the greatest success in the treatment of Constipation, Biliousness, Sick Headache, Impaired Digestion and Diver
Disorders. Chamberlain’s Tablets not only move the bowels but improve the appetite and correct disorders of the stomach
and liver. Where Chamberlain’s Tablets have been used they are a most popular medicine and everyone who has used them
is pleased with the prompt relief they afford. THEY ARE BETTER THAN PIDDS and you would never wish to take another
dose of pills after having used Chamberlain’s Tablets ; they are easier and more pleasant to take, more mild and gentle in
their action and more reliable, as they can always be depended upon. Chamberlain’s Tablets cleanse and invigorate the
stomach and leave the bowels in a natural condition, while pills are more harsh in effect and their use is often followed
by constipation. They are sold by all chemists and storekeepers throughout the Commonwealth at Is. 6d. per box.

A Sermon for Farmers.
BRETHREN, let us confer, and the
subject of our conference shall be
grain. “Golden grain” it is spoken
of in the works of “Bellerive” and other
famous poets, but ordinary blokes call it
wheat. Wheat is grown by coves called
farmers, with the object of making a living,
and very often the living isn’t what it might
be. When this is so it is dead easy to blame
William Hughes or the war or Federation or
any other old thing, but it is much more
sensible for the farming community to gird
up its collective loins and set about improv-
ing the said living.
It is generally agreed, dearly beloved
brethren, that as a man soweth so shall he
reap, but unless the reaping is scientifically
attended to the sowing may go for dashed
little. Obviously there is neither horse nor
any other brand of sense in growing ten bags
to the acre and only reaping seven or eight.
What is the good of growing grain, golden
or otherwise, if it is not harvested properly
when it is grown?
The manner in which reaping is carried
out depends largely upon the machine with
which you do the job. When you buy a
harvesting machine you don’t want an affair
that wastes quarter as much at the back as
it takes in at the front. Neither do you
want a mechanical mystery that is loaded
with as many chains as a handcuff. king, and
has sprockets and things you don’t under-
stand concealed about its person, and is
pitted with so many oil holes that it looks
as though they have been put there by
white ants. Properly to understand some of
these contrivances requires the mechanical
ingenuity of an Edison combined with the
deductive abilities of a Sherlock Holmes or
a Melbourne John Hop. Furthermore and
moreover, you don’t want a machine that
smashes a cog or two in the first round and
frays your tempers badly at the edges on
the first day you use it.
What you want is a machine that a big
boy can drive all day long. One that purrs
sweetly, like the harmless, necessary family
cat, and travels expeditiously round the pad-
dock, picking up every ear and saving every
grain. It should be both solid and simple;
so simple that even the thickest-headed man
to whom you give a job (and pay Arbitra-
tion Court rates) cannot mess it about. Also
you don’t want to have to hire elephants to
pull it, for there is no sense in paying an
elephant tax as well as a land tax, and,
anyhow, elephants are liable to get loose in
the vegetable garden and make it look untidy.
The machine should be the sort that the
ordinary farm team can yank along while
it eats up the acres from sunrise to dusk, if
necessary.
Another point to remember is to get a
big machine while you are at it. Size is not
everything, but it is something. One man
with one team can strip 20 or 25 acres in a
day with a big machine, whereas a small
machine will
only do half
the work.
Direct your
optics at the
pretty pic-
ture at the
top. The
machine
there de-
picted cuts
eight feet
wide every
trip and
misses
nothing. For
further in-
formation on
this point go
to Messrs.
Pa 11 erson
Bros., Burn-
hatha West,
Victoria.
Last season
they used one of these machines in an oat
crop seven feet high, the top three feet being
full of grain. The machine did that easily by
way of a preliminary canter before setting
its mind to the big business of the wheat crop,
where it took off a big yield in record time.
Big machines such as this—also a bigger
one with a 10-feet cut—have only been out
four or five years, but they are comers. All
the men with big areas under crop are going
in for them. They have all the good quali-
ties of the little old machines and a few
additional advantages of their own. Twenty
years of hard thinking by inventors and
hard working by manufacturers have gone
to the making of them, and they carry the
improvements worked out in. that time.
All the same, the old machines were not
too. bad. The Smaller of the illustrations
which we are so kind as to supply shows one
of the small machines that was set to work
over twenty-seven years ago, and, like the
bloke in the firewater advertisement, is still
going strong This machine is on the farm
of William Kearney, jun., of Hothamwood,
Glenthomps-m. Victoria, and he says that it
has not cost him £1 (one pound sterling) in
repairs in all that time. So it will be seen
that it is not necessary to have the income
of a Tyson or a Kidman, or of even a sue-
cessful pugilist, to keep one of these machines
going. They cost less for repairs than a
fountain-pen and are not possessed of half
its cussedness. Mr. Kearney says that his
machine has taken off over a hundred acres
every year, and it looks as though it is
going to da It some more before he has fin-
ished with it. But the big machines of
to-day are better and stronger than the little
fellows were, just as a Dreadnought is better
and stronger than the good ship Cerberus
although once upon a time the Cerberus was
the best thing of its kind on the market. The
latest machines pull lighter and strip cieaner
than ever.
To find one of these machines it will not
be necessary for you to take a journey from
the Ninety Mile Beach to the Gulf of Car-
pentaria. There are over 25,000 of them in
sheds all over the Commonwealth, only wait-
ing for an oiling to make them ready to get
going in another crop and reap the grain
that means so much to J. Bull in his dis-
agreement with the Hun.
Also in addition to these 25,000 machines
already in use, there are a few thousand
more, brand-new ones, at the maker’s factory
ready for the fray. They were not brought
to the Commonwealth in a ship or by aero-
plane. They were made right here in Aus-
tralia out of Australian steel and Aus-
tralian timber, by Australian brains and
Australian brawn. When you buy an im-
ported machine and it does not turn out to
be all that you expected, you may see an
agent about it, but you can’t talk direct with
the manufacturer, unless you are prepared
to carry on a conversation by cable, which,
as a pastime, is more expensive than motor-
ing and less satisfactory than stamp-collect-
ing. . But if you purchase an Australian
machine, and it doesn’t suit you, you can
step round and tell the maker exactly what
you think of him, and the chances are tha
after mutual explanations you will return
home satisfied. _
Another point to remember is that when
the farmer buys a locally-made machine hi
money stays in Australia. It is spent i
Australia, and most of it gets back to tn
farmers’ pockets, as it must do in the en
so long as it circulates in this country,
goes back to the farmer in the form ot P‘ .
ment for butter, wool, spuds, cauliflower .
pumpkins and everything else that the m
on the land raises. ,
This is merely one of many reasons why
is wise for the farmer to purchase AU ,
tralian-made harvesters, and the best
them are made by McKay at Sunshi >
Victoria.

SHOES are exquisitely cool and light in the
hottest weather, yet none of your dowdy,
canvas shoes either but smart, elegant, in
the fore-front of fashion. Most Australian
women will have sighed for such shoes, and here
they are in the latest shipment of Bostoeks. The
model illustrated is delightful even in picture
form. But think of it in reality, a light, grace-
ful shoe of finest moire, built in that new, short-
fronted shape so thoroughly French, and made
with a dainty Louis heel. If ever there was
an ideal shoe for smart wear in hot weather, it
is certainly this one. Then for other tastes,
there are other shoes equally charming in this
Bostock selection. The shoes are unmistakable,
and have the name Bostock stamped on the soles.

“Lou” : George McGowan, selected Labor-
ite for St. Ivilda (Vic.), has inked Victoria
a bit. He was a comp, at Kyneton, but
threw off the apron to boss the show. Next
he took hold of the Tungamah Independent,
and in turn edited Shepparton Advertiser,
Berrigan ’Tiser and Walhalla Miner. He
is now organiser for the Implement Makers’

From George Mackay, of the Advertiser :
“Quarter Single” (B. 13/9/’l7) on the founding
of the Bendigo Advertiser is here and there astray.
The paper was not “founded” by Cook and Sherbon,
as stated, but by A. M. Lloyd and R. R. Haverfield.
As their plant had not arrived when it was first
published on December 9, 1553, it was printed by
Cook and Sherbon. A few weeks later the plant
was ready and the imprint on March 3, 1854, was as
follows: “Printed and published by the proprietor,
Robert Ross Haverfield, of View Point, Bendigo, at
his printing office, View Point, Bendigo, in the town-
ship of Sandhurst, in the colony of Victoria.” Mr.
Haverfield and Mr. Lloyd were still the proprietors
when, in May, 1855, the Advertiser was purchased
by Angus Mackay, J. J. Casey and J. Henderson.
Some years later Mr. Haverfield became the editor,
and he remained at his post till his death in April,
1889. “Quarter Single” states that Mr. Haverfield
was “still connected with the Advertiser as proof-
reader up to 30 years ago, and Tom Kelynack, of the
Melbourne Herald, got his first job in a newspaper
office ‘holding copy’ for the old man.” It is true
that Tom Kelynack got his first job in a newspaper
on the Advertiser: but Mr. Haverfield was in the
chair, and his editorials were distinguished in the
last year of his life by the charm and force and
ability which characterised them at the zenith of his
career. He rendered inestimable service to Bendigo.
Away back in the ’6o’s he prophesied that gold
would be found by deep sinking on the quartz reefs.
He was opposed by the geologists of the day, but
lived to see it proved that his views on the subject
were not those of a dreamer, by the discovery of rich
reefs 2000 and 3000 feet beneath the surface. As
the sons of the late Mr. Angus Mackay became the
proprietors of the Advertiser three .rears before Mr.
Haverfield died, I would not like it to be understood
that they had deposed Mr. Haverfield from the posi-
tion which he had filled so long with such con-
spicuous ability.
* * * *
Tom Kelynack, Melbourne Herald’s vet-
eran roundsman, has two sons who have
climbed to commissions. Philip Thomas has
just become a captain in the Vet. Corps,
A.1.F.; and an elder boy, who left with the
Signallers in 1914, is a lieutenant of Engi-
neers in France.

Caleb Cheong, of Melbourne, who lately
visited China for the first time, was greatly
impressed by the printing outfit of Dr.
Fongsec, at Shanghai. This establishment,
styled the Commercial Press, covers 12 acres
and employs more than 2800 hands,
Chinese all. The litho. machines and
offset presses were imported, but the
engineering department at the works
turns out platen and cylinder machines.
Also the Fongsec factories make inks
and do bookbinding, and the printing of
banknotes is one of the firm’s lines. Nothing
is conspicuously barbaric on the premises
except the spirit of industry. The I.W.W.
has not yet got a branch organisation in
Shanghai, and Fongsec has no workers who
go slow with the idea of getting rich quick.
“Holy M.”: Melbourne, the city of dread-
ful wowserism, has no less than 10
“religious” weeklies, the contributors to
which are largely in the village-blacksmith
class. Each of ’em “earns whate’er he can”
and seldom attempts the manufacture of
literary hairsprings. Of the whole lot who
earn crust or crumb by helping in this great
work of uplift, only two have proved so
sordid as to join the trade-union of their
craft, the A.J.A.

The Burnie (Tas.) Times (25/9/’l7)
describes the antics of a revolutionary filly:
Getting up on its hind legs, it struck at him with
both hind feet.
It recalls the verdict of the jury at the
Quandong: “We find that deceased met his
death at the hands of a horse.”
The Mackay (N.Q.) Daily Standard
scars above its troubles: —
We were fortunate enough to obtain from our
townsman, Mr. C. Froggatt, a fairly large lot
of what is known as “butcher's paper”—
sheets 6ft. 6in. in width and about 10ft. in length,
done up in rolls which resembled in size and weight
those of linoleum. The paper turned out a very
acceptable substitute, and for the past 15 days we
have been actually reversing the generally accepted
order of things by transforming the sausage wrapper
into the newspaper —and that, too, without exciting
the suspicions or offending the susceptibilities of our
readers. But the secret is out; and so also is our
supply of “butcher’s paper.” To-day’s publication
witnesses the calling up of further resources, for
about one-half the issue is printed on grocer’s
wrapping-paper.
TO A VERY YOUNG CRITIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dear Child, when by your snowy cot
You close your eyes and fold your hands,
Say: “Please keep me from writing rot
That no grown person understands.”
Then say: “Please guide my little pen
And, when I’ve gone clean o’er the fence,
Ob, see that older, wiser men
Cut out the green impertinence!”
“God bless the sub., who keeps my small
Extended fingers from my nose;
Through such vulgarities I fall
And ruin quite my mannish pose.”
Omit one only when at night
You pipe your prayers by lamplight dim—
That fiend who puts in all you w r rite.
No, no Child! Do not pray for him!

Miss Anna Case, who proves
the re-creative power of
The NEW EDISON
Everyone who appreciates music at its best should have The NEW EDISON.
It brings to the home the world’s choicest music exactly as originally
rendered.
Read this report of a relentless Tone Test made before an audience of over
2500 music-lovers:—
“Miss Anna Case, prima donna of the Metropolitan Opera Company, stood
beside The NEW EDISON and sang several numbers with the instrument
records of which had previously been made from her voice So Perfectly dui
the instrument blend with her voice that the audience could not distinguis
except by her lips when Miss Case ceased singing. During the rendition oi
the ‘Song of I rid ia’ the house was darkened, and until the lights were turned
on no one knew Miss Case had left tlie stage.... The Test con\inced many
sceptics of the triumph of Mr. Edison’s genius in re-creating the human voice
in all its naturalness.” —“St. Louis Post-Dispatcli.”

“I have recommended
New Discovery times with-
out number, and all my
friends think as I do, that
it is the premier of all

I recommend it most
heartily, and I would not do
6o if I were not absolutely
sure of what I say.

Hold,
And, oh, but it's, there that I long to be.
Dreaming the dreams of old.
Oh, I dreamed a dream 'twixt the moon-set
white
And the wild red dawn of a haunted day ;
Kiss me, nor chide me, O Heart's Delight
For I must away, away.
Soft is the sunlight on Brognahee.
Softer the shadows in Gwelna Hold ;
But they’re calling me, calling me, calling
me,
Gathering rainbow' gold.
“Oh, it’s far and far to the rainbow’s rim ;
It is far and far,” said my love to me,
“And your heart will ache and your eyes
grow dim.
Yearning for Brognahee.
“Tarry awhile for the bluebell blows,
And the bonnets o’ buttercups bend and
nod :
Tarry awhile, my Heart o’ the Rose,
For the spell of the golden-rod!”
Oh. the rainbow gold is far to find,
And sharp are the spears of the hillside
sleet,
But I follow and follow all faint and blind
The prints of the fairy feet.
Is it wings or winds by the salt sea foam,
Or came the call of my love to me?
“Heart o’ the Rose, come home, come home,
With the swallows to Brognahee!”
But faint I follow and fast they flee
(Years o’ days are a tale that’s told),
And weary, weary the heart of me,
Seeking for rainboAV gold.

Pilot me back to the dear home things,
Pilot me home to-night!
It is far, so far to the rainbow’s rim.
It is far, so far that my feet must fail,
Though the crocks of gold be full to the brim
Down in the fairy vale.
And ne\'er a swallow will stay his flight;
The fairies are fled and the world is chill;
Oh, have you forgotten me, Heart’s Delight,
Are you Avatching and calling still?
Late, ah late in a lonely day
Shall it profit me now that I hold in fee
More of delight than a mortal may?
Ah, bitter-sweet Brognahee!
Shall it profit me ooav that the hills we trod
Were templed halls of the gods of old,
And the misty cups of the golden-rod
Were brimming Avith rainbow gold?
The bonnets o’ buttercups bend and blow.
And over the dark of the distance swells,
Now sad and solemn, now soft and low,
The tolling of fairy bells.

Hold,
And, oh, but it’s there that I long to be,

MARIE E.J. PITT.
The Curate’s Rat-trap.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was just striking two when the side-
door of the Bishop’s sleeping-palace was
flung open and a sobbing curate, robed
in a purple dressing-gown and illuminated by
an electric torch, dashed out and coursed
down the garden path. Taking the first turn
to the right round the clipped yew hedge, he
flew straight for the other wing of the build-
ing and flung a handful of gravel at a second-
storey window. The stones rattled on the
glass and pattered back into the ivy on the
wall without rousing the man inside; but a
second handful did the trick and the window
squeaked up.
“Who’s that? What’s the matter?” roared
the dim bishop.
“It is I, sir—Bathbrick! Something ter-
rible has happened, sir !”
“What is it, Bathbrick —anybody ill?”
“Oh no, sir ! It’s worse than that! Some-
thing’s caught in the rat-trap, sir!”
“Well, let it out, Bathbrick! Surely to
goodness you can let it out?”
The agitated curate danced a little on the
dewy path—it Avould have made quite a good
turn with Edward German’s “Torch Dance ’
music. “Oh, sir, I dare not let it out —it is
too terrible!”
“Nonsense, man! What is it —the dog?”
“No, sir! It's the Devil! 1 ’
The Bishop waA'ed white arms at him.
“Bathbrick, you’ve been drinking!”
The curate wrung his hands in the air and
the wriggling electric torch flashed its rays
in all directions, suggesting that a supernume-
rary Jove was rehearsing with toy thunder-
bolts. “Oh, sir, I couldn’t imagine such a
dreadful thing! Won’t you coma and see for
yourself, sir? The odor of sulphur is terrible,
and I’m afraid he’ll wake up the housekeeper
if he keeps on swearing! Please come down,
sir!”
“Coming!” shouted the Bishop, and van-
ished from the window. It was some time
before the dignitary opened the side-door and
stepped out into the night air. But he had
made good use of his dressing interval, for he
had robed himself most impressively. “I
thought it safer !” he said in explanation as
the curate caught sight of him. “Now light
the Avay for me.” The curate scurried ahead
with the light, and the two churchmen clut-
tered to the door the curate had made his
exit by. A faint but threatening smell of
sulphur hung about the hall, and the Bishop
shivered slightly as they rustled up the hall
and mounted the stairs.
“Tell me how it happened,” he whispered
when they reached the first landing and
paused for breath.
Bathbrick turned up the collar of his
dressing-gown, looked to see that the house-
keeper's door was closed, and started.
“It was one of those snapping one-and-six-
penny traps they sell at Boodler's in the
main street. I baited it with some crumbled
cheese wrapped up in the loose leaf of an
old torn hymn-book I picked up in the Sun-
day-school yesterday, and before retiring to
rest I placed the trap in front of the cup-
board. chaining it to the floor as an extra pre-
caution. About a quarter of an hour ago I
was awakened by a terrible scuffling sound ;
it sounded as if a large dog had been caught,
but I knew very well that no dog could get
into the house. Then I smelt sulphur, sir,
and thought the house must be on fire. I got
out of bed and switched on the torch, and
the instant the light shone out a dreadful
bestial howl rang through the house. ‘The
gardener is intoxicated,’ I said, and hurried
ont to soothe him. But when I flashed my
light into the hall I saw this—this dreadful
thiug. sir! Oh. it was horrible!”
The Bishop shuddered. “What is it like?”
“It looks like a black monkey, sir—just
like a black monkey that has had all its hair
singed off. When I tried to go near it it
snarled and bit the chain and its teeth
looked hot —red-hot!”
“Does it look very dangerous. Bathbrick?”
“Sir, it looks as dangerous as a mad dog!”
“You sai(J it swore, didu’t you?”
“Yes, sir, it swears—or it makes horrible
noises that sound like swearing. And, of
course, it smells terribly! You can smell it
from here, can’t you?”
“Yes, yes! Now let me see —what can we
do with it?”
“Couldn’t we get it taken away in a cart,
sir?”
“But think of the scandal. Bathbrick —
and the sensational papers would make fun
out of it! No, we can't allow the press to
get as much as an inkling of this. What-
ever is to be done must be done by you and
me before dawn. Lock the housekeper’s
door at once.”
The curate stole along, transferred the
bedroom-door key from the inner to the
outer side, and turned it softly in the lock.
“Good! That reduces the risk of dis-
covery. Now what is this suggestion of
yours about a cart? Do you think you and
I could manage to get it away safely by our-
selves?” f
“I doubt it, sir ! The thing seems terri-
bly strong and savage—it is a task for
strong laboring men who are used to carry-
ing heavy burdens, if I may say so.”
“Quite so; but we dare not allow the
lower classes to know such a thing was cap-
tured in the palace, and you know how I
dislike any mention of Hell! Why, only last
month I preached the sermon suggesting
that the belief in this sort of creature was
all very well for the Middle Ages but didn’t
fit in with modern conditions. No. Bath-
brick, we must attend to. this ourselves.”
“I know!” cried the curate. “ We’ll say
the thing is a German! So far as I can see.
it really looks like some of those horrible
things the cartoonists draw. Let’s say we
have captured a German, sir!”
“That won’t do, either!” cried the Bishop
“In a time like this it might precipitate a
panic. You know very well how the sensa-
tional press would handle it—‘German Cap-
tured in Australia. Suspected Secret Land-
ing on the Coast.’ Then anything might
happen ! No, it’s no use trying to shirk our
plain duty, Bathbrick ! We must see this
through, even if it kills us !”
A snarl of rage from the landing above
interrupted the council of war and made the
Bishop jump. “Come on!” he whispered,
and led the way tremblingly up the stairs
whitened by the wavering electric beam.
“ There it is!” whispered the curate,
directing the light at the far corner where
something sat mumbling its chain.
“It can’t be the Devil!” said the expert,
after craning his neck at it. “I can’t con-
ceive a one-and-sixpenny trap holding the
Evil One himself! It is one of his imps.”
“But it proves” prompted the shiver-
ing curate.
“Yes, yes! It proves a great many un-
pleasant things, and we mustn’t allow any-
thing to be known about it. Go and get a
sack at once!”
The curate fell down two steps. “A sack,
sir?”
“Yes —one of the sacks the coal came in
yesterday.”
“But—but how will we get it in, sir?”
“Never mind about that now. Bathbrick !
Get the sack, and we’ll manage it somehow!
Quickly now !”
Bathbrick turned and fled to do his bid-
ding. The electric light went with him, and
the Bishop was left holding a guttering
candle on high.
It wasn’t far to the coal-shed, and Bath-
brick ran as fast as he could, but when he
had done half of the return journey he heard
shouts for help. Half-way up the stairs he
got the news. “He blew out the candle and
tried to bite me!” sobbed the Bishop. “Don’t
take that torch away again, whatever you
do—it seems to be more afraid of the light
than anything.”
“Here’s the sack, sir!” chattered the
curate.
“Very good, then. I’ll hold it open while
you push him into it.”
“Oh, sir, I dare not do that —not with my
bare hands, sir.”
“Well, well, well! Go and get the garden
rake.”
“But what if he should snatch it from
me, sir? He is terribly strong, as you can
see.”
The Bishop clicked his tongue impati-
ently. “Don’t be so timid, Bathbrick. We
must be courageous if Ave are ever to get
this dreadful thing out of the palace. After
all, it is not the Devil! Think how dreadful
it would have been if it had been the Evil
One himself!”
The curate shivered miserably. “I shall
not buy any more rat-traps at Boodler’s,” he
moaned.
The Bishop suddenly remembered a point
and put on his most severe manner. “The
cardinal mistake was in wrapping the cheese
in a leaf of the hymn-book, Bathbrick. That
was not a proper use for such sacred writ-
ings.”
“I am very sorry, sir—very sorry,
indeed !”

DAILY MISHAPS
MAKE ZAM-BUK A DAILY NEED,
ACCIDENTS will happen in the best-regulated
families. Healthy youngsters seem to be
always “in the wars.” Housework abounds
with mishaps for busy wives and harassed mothers;
and the bread-winner often returns from work
with a more or less serious injury. Just what
every home needs is Zam-Buk. A pot and a
bandage on a handy shelf, where they are handy
for instant use, save untold pain, time and money.
When the little one runs in from his play with
a wry face, and smarting, dirt-filled scrape on his
knee, simply wash the part and smear with Zam-
Buk. When father cuts or scrapes his hand, the
handy pot of Zam-Buk again meets the emergency,
and the housewife or mother continually finds it
a real friend for the burns she receives while cook-
ing, the scalds of a washing day, or the knocks,
etc., of dusting. Children like Zam-Buk because
it is cooling, soothing and pleasant. Their elders
value it still more highly because it is also anti-
septic and a powerful germicide, preventing poison-
ing, festering, and disease; because it is a natural
skin repairer, and because it is good for the
tenderest skin. Daily mishans make Zam-Buk a
daily need —therefore, keep Zam-Buk handy.
MAN’S POISONED
HAND HEALED.
Mr. J. Vaughan, of 14
Sorrie Street, Balmain,
Sydney, says:—“l sustained a
severe knock on the back of my
left hand. Some dirt got into
the wound, causing my hand to
swell and inflammation to set
in. The pain was terrible.
Being recommended to try Zam-
Buk, I obtained a supply, and,
after bathing the wound, applied
this balm twice daily. In this
way blood-poison was averted,
the inflammation was allayed,
and the pain arrested. Now
my hand is well once again.”
SCALD MADE
FLESH RED-RAW.
Mrs. G. Green, of 57
Thomas Street, Camper-
down, Sydney, says:—“My
little son John upset a kettle of
boiling water over himself, and
was nearly scalded to death.
The flesh presented a red, raw
appearance. We all expected
he would succumb to the fear-
ful injuries, and it is a miracle
that he is alive to-day. For
nine months he was in terrible
agony. The sores from the
scald would not heal. After
being attended to at the hospi-
tal, the doctor recommended a
home treatment of Zam-Buk.
We purchased a supply and con-
tinued with Zam-Buk until the
wounds were completely healed.”
THE EVER-READY HOME HEALER.
A golden rule for every home
is - Keep Zam-Buk Always
Handy. Don’t run risks by
depending upon common
ointments and salves, the
coarseness of which is a posi-
tive danger. There is only
one Zam-Buk, and it is sold
by all chemists and stores
at 1/6 and 3/6 per pot

A DIFFERENCE.
The Auto Strop is different from every other kind
of safety razor. Only those who have tried it
can appreciate its vast superiority. You can
put up a new keen edge on the blade daily—
by simply slipping the strop through the razor
and passing it to and fro.
AutoSirop
Safety Razor
As a safety razor it eliminates risk; and its special
construction eliminates the necessity of constant
blade renewals, and the time and trouble in
cleaning which every other safety razor involves.

“You have a right to be sorry, Bathbrick.
No doubt it was that which attracted the
disgraceful creature. Now pull yourself
together like a good fellow, and let us repair
-this mistake!”
“Hey ! I thought it was burglars!” called
a male voice on the floor below.”
“Wagglin!” gasped the two clergymen
together—and the disturbed verger came
cautiously up the stairs with a candle in one
hand and a very old and dangerous-looking
revolver in the other. “What’s th’ matter?
I seen th’ lights an’ thought somethin’ ’ad
’appened.”
“Something has happened!” groaned the
Bishop. “I rely on you, Wagglin, not to say
anything about this outside!”
“About what, sir?”
“About that in the corner! Look for
yourself!”
The verger approached the unspeakable
heap unsuspectingly Avith candle held high
and revolver at the ready.
“Mind, man! Take care of yourself!”
The Avarning came too late. As the trapped
A-isitor leapt into the air, Wagglin let out a
horrified yell and dropped the candle. The
revolver _ exploded deafeningly; the curate
fell against the Bishop and dropped the
torch, smashing it; something seemed to fly
through the air and crash down the stairs.
After that, the place was full of darkness,
cries for help, sulphurous smells and dis-
tracted batterings on a closed door.
When, after interminable excursions and,
alarms, the hysterical housekeeper was re-
leased from her room she found a dis-
traught bishop Avith his mouth full of bab-
blings about escaped burglars. The curate
and the verger had dispersed, and the house
smelt like a theatre after the big scene of a
Avar drama. It was almost daylight before
the household settled doAAm again.
The verger’s stipend Avas raised half a
crown a week next morning, and Bathbrick
applied for sick-leave, and got it. Before he
Avent off duty the Bishop directed him to pin
a fresh notice on the board notifying that he
(the Bishop) Avould speak next Sunday at
II on “The Revival of Belief in Eternal
Punishment.”
Up to time of Avriting the papers have not
reported anything found dead Avith a bullet-
wound in its hide ; but there is no mark on
the wall of the landing where the shot Avas
fired. The Bishop occasionally has misgiv-
ings, but always comforts himself with the
thought that the sensational press did not
get hold of the story. Also he is glad that
Boodler, the hardware man, has not heard
that the thing was caught in one of his one-
and-sixpenny traps. Boodler is just the sort
of man Avho would turn the information into
a flaring advertisement regardless of anyone’s
feelings.
KODAK.
Naval Hospitality.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was one of those trying days of swel-
tering heat which precede the setting in
of the wet season. On either hand
across the 'glarey harbor the tropical verdure
bore evidence of scorching months; brown-
parched palms drooped their scraggy
branches limply, and seemed to voice the
general desire for rain—and a deluge of it.
A man-of-war, swathed fore and aft in
bleached, evenly-spread awnings, lay at
anchor off the landing jetty, and two rusty,
deserted-looking coal-hulks swung to their
buoys close in to the scrubby mangrove
shore. A fleet of sailing craft lay becalmed
a mile away, awaiting the grateful sea-
breeze to speed them along to the native
village.
The transport Arrowroot, laden with a
mixed cargo of coal, ammunition and naval
stores, steamed into Calabash Bay and
anchored under the lee of the coral reef
which forms a natural breakwater to the
harbor.
Captain Ringbolt focussed his glasses on
to the cruiser.
“That’s our ship, all right,” he said, more
to himself than to anyone in particular.
The officer on the bridge with him picked
up a telescope and looked also.
“Seems like her, sir,” he said. “Not many
of ’em have that torpedo tube-fixin’ in the
stem.”
“Hun,” remarked the captain. “Ring off
the engines,” he said, “and tell the chief-
officer to lower the gig as soon as possible.”
“Aye, aye, sir.”
In a little while Captain Ringbolt was
being pulled over to H.M.S, Counterpane.
The officer of the day greeted him at the top
of the gangway.
“Good-day, sir,” he said as they shook
hands.
“Good-day,” said Captain Ringbolt. “I
wondered if we’d catch you here. Captain
on board?”
“Yes—come inside, will you?” the lieu-
tenant replied, leading the way along the
quarter-deck and in through the alleyway
under the break of the poop. He thrust a
door-curtain aside, and Captain Ringbolt
entered the wardroom.
“Outside, there!” rasped the officer, at
the same time holding out his open cigarette-
case.
“Thanks,” said Captain Ringbolt, and
settled himself in a leather-backed armchair.
“By Jove, sir,” the lieutenant said, “jolly
glad to see you.” A wardroom attendant
appeared at the door. “Er, two cocktails.
Just about down and out,” he added, turn-
ing again to the captain. “Short of stores —
every bally thing. Smacking it about for
over two years—perishing hot—darned hard
to pick up grub. Luxuries, nil.”
The servant swizzled the pink-colored
decoction and handed the drinks round.
“Cheerio!” said the lieutenant.
“ ’Luck !” said the captain.
A Naval and Military Record fluttered
on to the deck from the sofa in the corner of
the wardroom near the bookcase; and the
paymaster, turning over and seeing Captain
Ringbolt, roused himself and yawned.
“Apologise for my apparent shortcomings,
sir,” he said, coming forward lazily and
shaking hands with the captain. “Abso-
bally-lutely bored to extinction in this torrid
atmosphere,” he added ; then turned towards
the door and yelled out: “Pantry !”
“You’ll have our stores, I take it, Cap-
tain?” he asked.
“Yes, got about fifty tons of stuff for the
Counterpane,” replied Captain Ringbolt.
“Good man!”
The servant entered the room.
“Tot, Cherub?” queried the paymaster.
“Right-o, thanks,” replied the officer of
the day abstractedly, throwing poker hands
with the dice on the table.
“Er, three cocktails!” said the paymaster.
“Hope you’ve got a good fill of spuds for us,
Captain. Haven’t tasted the precious mur-
phy for weeks. Flour’s a bit low, too.
and”
They raised their glasses. “Cheerio, sir!”
they said.
“ ’Luck !” said the captain.
The navigator blew in and threw a load
of books—logs and wine-account records—on
to the table.
“Hello, you noisy spalpeen !” shouted the
paymaster. “Here's the captain of the
Arrowroot with our stores, pilot,” he added
by way of introduction.
“Praise be to Allah !” said the navigator,
shaking the captain’s hand warmly. “S’pose
you’ve a vast quantity of gear for the most
important branch of His Majesty’s Service?”
he asked, at the same time squeezing the
acorn-shaped bell-pusher dangling from the
deck-head.
“Sir?” interjected the wardroom attend-
ant deferentially.
“Oh, er—four cocktails!” said the navi-
gator.
A tinge of anxiety crossed Captain Ring-
bolt’s face. He rose from his comfortable
chair and leaned against the brass-railed
sideboard. .
“You’ll excuse this unseemly display, sir,”
said the paymaster, “but we are trained in
the art of smiting and” •
“Yes, and as we can’t get hold of square-
heads on our patrol,” interrupted the navi-
gator, suddenly swinging round and attack-
ing the paymaster, “we keep our hands in
—thus !”
They clutched each other and flopped in-
artistically on to the sofa, to the detriment
of its sorely-tried springs.
“Cease firing!” gasped “Pay,” struggling
valiantly—-“liquid refreshment!”
The servant handed round the drinks.
“Cheerio, and a glorious restoration of
our depleted mess!” added the paymaster
enthusiastically.
Captain Ringbolt gazed at his glass
glumly. “ ’Luck!” he murmured _ again.
“Er-r-r, gentlemen,” he said, mopping the
back of his neck with a silk handkerchief, “I
should be obliged if I could”- —-
Unrestrained mirth sounded in the alley-
way outside.
“That’s it, Pills! We’ll flatten ’em out
once and for all!” It was the engineer-
commander’s voice. He burst into the ward-
room, followed by the surgeon carrying golf
clubs in one hand a caged canary in the
other.
“I say, you birds!” the chief flung out
jauntily. “ ‘Pills’ and I are unanimous in
Wells’s theory that doctors and engineers
are the only professions necessary for the
world’s future welfare !”
“Oh, wash out, Chief,” said the paymaster.
“The captain of the Arrowroot’s here with
stores.”
“Good biz,” said the engineer-commander.
“How d’y’do, sir? Outside there!”
Captain Ringbolt picked up his topee and
backed gently towards the door. It occurred
to him that as naval cocktails were potent—
peculiarly so at 92deg.—it would be as well
if he had his say with the captain without
further delay.
“The captain’s disengaged, I suppose?” he
asked in an undertone.
“Oh, yes, you want to report to ‘the
owner,’ of course,” said the lieutenant.
“This way, will you?”
They brushed past the steward and made
their way aft along the alleyway. The table
was already laid for lunch in the captain’s
messing apartment. They passed through
this room, and the lieutenant knocked at the
inner cabin door.
“Captain of the Arrowroot to see you,
sir.” he said.
“Oh, thank you. Just come in, will you?”
Captain Ringbolt stepped into a comfort-
ably-furnished sitting-room and shook hands
with the Counterpane’s captain.
“Sit down—have a cigarette!” said the
owner, pushing a silver boxful towards his
visitor and turning towards the door.
“Sentry !”
Captain Ringbolt started. “Thank you,
sir,” he said mildly, helping himself,
“You arrived well to time,” said the cap-
tain’ of the cruiser. “And you’re very wel-
come, I assure you. Been on reduced rations
for some time. Darned unsatisfactory— not
to say beastly unpleasant.”
A sentry appeared in the doorway and
saluted. His captain glanced round at him
casually.
“Er, two cocktails !” he said.
CATHEAD.
An Ugly Duckling.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘ ‘ | F good men asked I would not wed,”
| The cobbler’s little daughter said
“So ugly I it would not do;
My baby would be ugly, too.
“My hair is dull as woollen rags,
My skin no fairer than a hag’s;
My eyes are small, my nose is flat —
I would not have a child like that,
“It sure would, break my heart in two.”.. .
She wed the first who came to woo.
In time arrived a baby fat:
Her eyes were small, her nose was flat,
Her hair was like old rags, her face
Had no redeeming touch of grace.
To me the mother held her child.
Through tears ineffable she smiled.
“Babe is not very strong,” said she,
“But draws increasing strength from me,
And all day long my sweet I press,
And wonder at her loveliness!”

If Engineers and Steam-plant Owners would only
realise the importance of EFFICIENTLY insulating
their Boilers, Steam Pipes, etc., more attention might
be paid to this particular matter. Great economies
can he effected in this direction, in some cases the coal
consumption being reduced as much as 50%. But the
insulating material must be of the very best.
Carbonate of Magnesia is to-day recognised as the best
non-conductor of heat. Newall's Coverings are com-
posed of 85% of this material, and 15% Asbestos—the
Asbestos being used for binding purposes only—and in
addition possess innumerable advantages over all other
forms of lagging. Newall’s Coverings are used, practi-
cally exclusively, by the British Admiralty. N.S.W.
and Victorian Governments, and have been used
throughout the ntiino. White Bay, Melbourne. Perth
